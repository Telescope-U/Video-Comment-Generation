eo49YPiwhU4,0,1365,- Are you only looking at my leg?
eo49YPiwhU4,1365,3450,"- [Crew] Yeah, I see a little bit of it."
eo49YPiwhU4,3450,4964,- So I should be more like this.
eo49YPiwhU4,4964,6510,(crew laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,6510,9649,"Today, we are going to be doing a queer fashion makeover."
eo49YPiwhU4,9649,10482,- Wow.
eo49YPiwhU4,10482,12930,- Every child and adults should have a chance
eo49YPiwhU4,12930,14070,to figure out who they are.
eo49YPiwhU4,14070,14903,- Gay bro.
eo49YPiwhU4,14903,16260,"- Yeah, just being a bro; gay bro."
eo49YPiwhU4,16260,17850,"- And when we reveal their final looks,"
eo49YPiwhU4,17850,19470,"it won't just be to themselves,"
eo49YPiwhU4,19470,22088,but also their loved ones will be joining us.
eo49YPiwhU4,22088,22921,- (screams) Oh my God!
eo49YPiwhU4,24420,27600,- When were you able to fully come out?
eo49YPiwhU4,27600,30570,- I was caught between two worlds.
eo49YPiwhU4,30570,32283,- I'm not loving myself in it.
eo49YPiwhU4,33300,36537,"- Welcome to ""The Try Gays""."
eo49YPiwhU4,37440,39383,I've been waiting eight years to say that.
eo49YPiwhU4,40371,42954,(upbeat music)
eo49YPiwhU4,58410,61500,"This is a new series called ""The Try Gays""."
eo49YPiwhU4,61500,64110,"You know, the spirit of ""The Try Guys"" has always been"
eo49YPiwhU4,64110,67080,"about embracing the unknown, trying new things"
eo49YPiwhU4,67080,68940,"outside of one's comfort zone,"
eo49YPiwhU4,68940,70770,and exploring different parts of your identity
eo49YPiwhU4,70770,72240,that you might not have tapped into.
eo49YPiwhU4,72240,75119,So it's really wonderful that we are now dedicating
eo49YPiwhU4,75120,77250,the entire group to my culture.
eo49YPiwhU4,77250,79890,"Fashion and style and personal expression,"
eo49YPiwhU4,79890,81960,is a huge part of queer identities.
eo49YPiwhU4,81960,84720,I am excited to introduce everyone to some friends
eo49YPiwhU4,84720,87627,and colleagues who are maybe just a little stuck
eo49YPiwhU4,87627,89490,in their own style journeys.
eo49YPiwhU4,89490,91200,And they're going to fully realize
eo49YPiwhU4,91200,94796,their authentic selves through fashion.
eo49YPiwhU4,94796,96213,Okay.
eo49YPiwhU4,97350,98937,"Let's meet our ""Try Gays""."
eo49YPiwhU4,100200,102060,Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.
eo49YPiwhU4,102060,105990,"- My name is Marcellus Kidd, I am from the Bay area."
eo49YPiwhU4,105990,109350,I am 32 and I identify as gay.
eo49YPiwhU4,109350,110850,I wear a lot of dark colors.
eo49YPiwhU4,110850,113909,"I am slightly colorblind, I like to say color dysplasia."
eo49YPiwhU4,113910,115560,"It's almost like I have a tent over my eyes,"
eo49YPiwhU4,115560,118500,"so I can see color, but I get very confused by color."
eo49YPiwhU4,118500,119883,"Everything that I see,"
eo49YPiwhU4,119883,123780,it's that every gay person has a great fashion sense.
eo49YPiwhU4,123780,125220,"So no, that's not all the way true."
eo49YPiwhU4,125220,126330,- [Eugene] It is certainly a stereotype
eo49YPiwhU4,126330,128289,that all gay men are fashionable.
eo49YPiwhU4,128289,129599,"- Yeah. - Yeah, or even care"
eo49YPiwhU4,129600,130433,about fashion.
eo49YPiwhU4,130433,131700,"Because it wasn't like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,131700,133410,our parents were raising us as gay men.
eo49YPiwhU4,133410,134615,- Right.
eo49YPiwhU4,134615,135448,- Can you imagine?
eo49YPiwhU4,135448,138090,"They'd be like, ""Yeah, you're gay, so get ready."
eo49YPiwhU4,138090,140629,"Here's here's like a whole book on Coco Chanel."""
eo49YPiwhU4,140629,141461,- (laughs) Right.
eo49YPiwhU4,141462,142295,- If only.
eo49YPiwhU4,142295,144270,"- [Marcellus] With gay culture in the Black culture,"
eo49YPiwhU4,144270,147330,the idea for a man is to still dress very masculine.
eo49YPiwhU4,147330,149190,"And I don't think anything is necessarily wrong with that,"
eo49YPiwhU4,149190,151380,"but by the same token, I wanna always feel like"
eo49YPiwhU4,151380,153960,I'm branching out to see all my options.
eo49YPiwhU4,153960,157170,- If you could describe your current style
eo49YPiwhU4,157170,158490,in just three words.
eo49YPiwhU4,158490,163170,"- Dark, confused, and comfortable."
eo49YPiwhU4,163170,164400,- Hmm.
eo49YPiwhU4,164400,165536,I relate to two of those things.
eo49YPiwhU4,165536,166709,(both laugh)
eo49YPiwhU4,166710,168030,I'm often dark and confused.
eo49YPiwhU4,168030,169410,- Yes. - I'm never comfortable.
eo49YPiwhU4,169410,170550,- Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,170550,173700,"- So my name is Carol, I am from Mission Viejo,"
eo49YPiwhU4,173700,175470,"California, down in the O.C."
eo49YPiwhU4,175470,178530,I am a gay lesbian woman.
eo49YPiwhU4,178530,181680,"- By saying ""Try Gays"", it's mainly a pun,"
eo49YPiwhU4,181680,183750,because there's one letter switched.
eo49YPiwhU4,183750,187260,"I should explicitly state, this is LGBTQ+,"
eo49YPiwhU4,187260,188220,it's not just gay.
eo49YPiwhU4,188220,190020,"- [Carol] I was born in Nicaragua,"
eo49YPiwhU4,190020,192480,I grew up there until about nine years old.
eo49YPiwhU4,192480,194040,"A war started over there,"
eo49YPiwhU4,194040,197129,so that's how my family immigrated to California.
eo49YPiwhU4,197130,200520,"We were Catholic, basically I was raised to think"
eo49YPiwhU4,200520,203220,that I was going to get married and have kids.
eo49YPiwhU4,203220,206943,"And well, I ended up getting married to a man."
eo49YPiwhU4,207933,209100,- Oh.
eo49YPiwhU4,209100,211080,"- Yes, yes."
eo49YPiwhU4,211080,214200,"After graduating college, I joined the police academy."
eo49YPiwhU4,214200,218160,That's where I met the man that I ended up marrying.
eo49YPiwhU4,218160,222630,"Something in me said, ""This can't be all."""
eo49YPiwhU4,222630,226980,It was extremely hard to tell my husband
eo49YPiwhU4,226980,228900,that I just wasn't happy.
eo49YPiwhU4,228900,233900,It wasn't until I was about 35 years old that I came out.
eo49YPiwhU4,234390,236220,One of the shows that opened my eyes
eo49YPiwhU4,236220,240060,"to what else is out there was when ""The L Word"" came out."
eo49YPiwhU4,240060,241920,Most lesbians that I saw on TV
eo49YPiwhU4,241920,243480,"were what they called ""butch""."
eo49YPiwhU4,243480,246690,I never identified with that.
eo49YPiwhU4,246690,249570,I also knew that I never liked wearing dresses.
eo49YPiwhU4,249570,252360,"I was caught between two worlds,"
eo49YPiwhU4,252360,254490,"and I just decided, ""You know what,"
eo49YPiwhU4,254490,258060,"I'm just going to dress the way I feel comfortable."""
eo49YPiwhU4,258060,261120,"And it's usually, you know, pants, shorts."
eo49YPiwhU4,261120,263220,"- [Eugene] How would you describe your current style,"
eo49YPiwhU4,263220,265143,"if you could, in three words?"
eo49YPiwhU4,268830,269729,- I need help.
eo49YPiwhU4,269730,271430,- I need help. (laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,271430,272263,- I need help.
eo49YPiwhU4,272263,273630,"- ""I need help""."
eo49YPiwhU4,273630,275040,- Yes.
eo49YPiwhU4,275040,277620,"- My name's Ally Cleveland, I'm a trans woman."
eo49YPiwhU4,277620,278820,She/her are my pronouns.
eo49YPiwhU4,278820,282210,"And I grew up in Michigan, and then I moved to Maine,"
eo49YPiwhU4,282210,284100,lived there for 30 years.
eo49YPiwhU4,284100,286200,And I've been in LA for just over a year.
eo49YPiwhU4,286200,290280,"In Michigan, in 1970, trans wasn't even really an idea."
eo49YPiwhU4,290280,291113,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,291113,293520,- [Ally] I started my transition in my early 50s.
eo49YPiwhU4,293520,295470,"The community was quite supportive,"
eo49YPiwhU4,295470,298830,but I was the head football coach at my high school.
eo49YPiwhU4,298830,300090,- What?
eo49YPiwhU4,300090,302441,"Wow, I can talk about football all day, 'cause Texas."
eo49YPiwhU4,302441,303390,"- [Ally] Yeah, yeah."
eo49YPiwhU4,303390,306120,"So going to meet with my players,"
eo49YPiwhU4,306120,308823,"and tell them that I was coming out as trans,"
eo49YPiwhU4,310003,311789,there were a lot of shocked faces.
eo49YPiwhU4,311790,312623,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,312623,314909,"- [Ally] I tried really hard to be a good man,"
eo49YPiwhU4,314910,315780,"but it didn't work,"
eo49YPiwhU4,315780,317850,and it created all kinds of problems.
eo49YPiwhU4,317850,322850,"Coming through that process has been forging a new life,"
eo49YPiwhU4,322950,324450,and has brought me West.
eo49YPiwhU4,324450,326190,"- [Eugene] What was it like for you,"
eo49YPiwhU4,326190,328200,as you sort of began to discover
eo49YPiwhU4,328200,330120,the type of style that you wanted to exhibit?
eo49YPiwhU4,330120,331949,"- [Ally] So it's been less than a decade,"
eo49YPiwhU4,331950,336950,"and in trans years, there's a compressed puberty,"
eo49YPiwhU4,337110,340530,and there's no culturization process.
eo49YPiwhU4,340530,341970,"- [Eugene] Yeah, we often say, especially if like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,341970,344250,"say if you're gay, or bisexual, or lesbian,"
eo49YPiwhU4,344250,346560,"then, you know, you feel the delayed puberty."
eo49YPiwhU4,346560,347393,"But maybe it's almost like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,347393,349770,"""Oh, I didn't get that high school dating experience."""
eo49YPiwhU4,349770,350639,- Right. - But especially
eo49YPiwhU4,350640,352920,"all my trans friends, they talk about this idea of like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,352920,355080,"in a lot of ways, parts of delayed childhood and puberty."
eo49YPiwhU4,355080,355913,- Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,355913,358267,"- Because we're so hammered since we're birthed, like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,358267,360247,"""Here's your blue bib, boy."""
eo49YPiwhU4,360247,361080,(Ally laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,361080,362759,"- ""And here's your pink doll, girl."""
eo49YPiwhU4,362760,364590,"And it's just like, that's the end all, be all."
eo49YPiwhU4,364590,366990,When you were able to finally express yourself-
eo49YPiwhU4,366990,368430,- Right. - what were those things
eo49YPiwhU4,368430,369840,that you were immediately drawn to?
eo49YPiwhU4,369840,372540,"- [Ally] You know, someone in my 50s wearing, you know,"
eo49YPiwhU4,372540,373935,a unicorn bikini-
eo49YPiwhU4,373935,376290,"- Yeah. - You know, that's really..."
eo49YPiwhU4,376290,378300,it's too confusing for people.
eo49YPiwhU4,378300,379133,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,379133,380931,"- But felt good at the time,"
eo49YPiwhU4,380931,383340,but it was a lot of skin and lots of colors.
eo49YPiwhU4,383340,386639,"And so now I feel like I'm stuck, I'm sort of plateaued."
eo49YPiwhU4,386640,389010,"- Yeah, if you could describe your current style"
eo49YPiwhU4,389010,390510,in just three words.
eo49YPiwhU4,390510,393150,"- Independent, chaotic, this is hyphenated,"
eo49YPiwhU4,393150,393990,but it's out-of-date.
eo49YPiwhU4,393990,396030,"You know, I wish I had been an adult"
eo49YPiwhU4,396030,397530,in Janis Joplin times.
eo49YPiwhU4,397530,399900,But I also am now at this point where my career's
eo49YPiwhU4,399900,402570,"starting to get traction, and I'm in higher circles."
eo49YPiwhU4,402570,405330,"- So you're looking to not necessarily change everything,"
eo49YPiwhU4,405330,406470,it's like elevating it.
eo49YPiwhU4,406470,410463,"- Yeah, yes, definitely need to elevate my game."
eo49YPiwhU4,411570,414030,"- I'm Nick Rufca, born and raised in Connecticut."
eo49YPiwhU4,414030,416880,"And then my family moved out to a Chicago suburb,"
eo49YPiwhU4,416880,420600,and I've been out in LA now for all my adult life.
eo49YPiwhU4,420600,423540,"- [Eugene] Now, ""The Try Guys"" audience knows you very well."
eo49YPiwhU4,423540,425820,You have been a producer here for quite a while now.
eo49YPiwhU4,425820,427800,"Yeah, Nick's getting in it."
eo49YPiwhU4,427800,430639,"We're gonna make him so hot, hotter than he already is,"
eo49YPiwhU4,430640,431970,if it's possible.
eo49YPiwhU4,431970,434520,"- When I got to LA is when I came out as a gay man,"
eo49YPiwhU4,434520,437310,"but I knew when I left college,"
eo49YPiwhU4,437310,439961,I would get to LA and just be out.
eo49YPiwhU4,439961,440794,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,440794,443160,"- So my coming out was like, as clean cut as that."
eo49YPiwhU4,443160,446850,"My thing was, as proud of a gay man as I am,"
eo49YPiwhU4,446850,449820,"I fit in with all of you, I am ""normal""."
eo49YPiwhU4,449820,451890,"I mean, at that time it was all about Abercrombie."
eo49YPiwhU4,451890,454890,"I was all about tank tops, and like, backwards hats,"
eo49YPiwhU4,454890,457320,and this uber-masculine presentation.
eo49YPiwhU4,457320,462210,"Because I feel like the message was, ""I'm proud of who I am,"
eo49YPiwhU4,462210,463650,"but I am just like you,"
eo49YPiwhU4,463650,465990,"so don't be too worried or panicked."""
eo49YPiwhU4,465990,466830,"- Yeah. - You know,"
eo49YPiwhU4,466830,467879,and I think- - That was kind of
eo49YPiwhU4,467880,469071,the messaging a lot of us-
eo49YPiwhU4,469071,470269,"- Yeah. - were around,"
eo49YPiwhU4,470269,473880,"with the sort of coming-out stories in the like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,473880,476250,"turn of the century, the millennium."
eo49YPiwhU4,476250,477083,- [Nick] Right.
eo49YPiwhU4,477083,477930,- [Eugene] People would pride themselves
eo49YPiwhU4,477930,480630,on being almost straight-masc.
eo49YPiwhU4,480630,481463,- [Nick] Totally.
eo49YPiwhU4,481463,482296,- [Eugene] And I think that anything
eo49YPiwhU4,482296,483780,that felt more feminine- - Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,483780,485760,- you're pressured to be in a mold
eo49YPiwhU4,485760,487807,that was very traditionally CisHet-masc.
eo49YPiwhU4,487807,490350,"- ""Yes, I'm gay, but I am going to show you"
eo49YPiwhU4,490350,491640,"I am such a man."""
eo49YPiwhU4,491640,492840,"- But have you seen that change a lot,"
eo49YPiwhU4,492840,493673,over the past few years?
eo49YPiwhU4,493673,495012,"- I have absolutely seen that change a lot,"
eo49YPiwhU4,495012,496380,"which I think is part of the reason why I'm here today,"
eo49YPiwhU4,496380,500130,is because I feel like I look at many younger queer people
eo49YPiwhU4,500130,501900,with complete admiration.
eo49YPiwhU4,501900,504030,Because I feel like now you're using your clothes
eo49YPiwhU4,504030,506130,to let the world know you're queer.
eo49YPiwhU4,506130,506963,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,506963,508170,"- [Nick] Now I'm so far in,"
eo49YPiwhU4,508170,510540,"and sort of married in this domestic life, I look back,"
eo49YPiwhU4,510540,511920,"I'm like, ""Oh, I sort of missed"
eo49YPiwhU4,511920,513390,"a part of expressing myself."""
eo49YPiwhU4,513390,516210,"- And how would you then describe, in three words,"
eo49YPiwhU4,516210,517890,what your style is currently?
eo49YPiwhU4,517890,522870,"- Routine, basic, and honestly, this one pains me to say,"
eo49YPiwhU4,522870,525000,but I feel like it's boring.
eo49YPiwhU4,525000,525870,- Whew- - I know.
eo49YPiwhU4,525870,527430,"- Routine, basic, and boring."
eo49YPiwhU4,527430,528960,- Which are three words I never wanted to be
eo49YPiwhU4,528960,529793,when I grew up.
eo49YPiwhU4,529793,531810,"- Many people have witnessed myself over the past,"
eo49YPiwhU4,531810,533940,"almost nine years, go through my own journey."
eo49YPiwhU4,533940,537330,Fashion and style is a way that one can speak a language
eo49YPiwhU4,537330,539640,"to others, without necessarily speaking out loud."
eo49YPiwhU4,539640,542280,"Our hair, our makeup, and of course our clothes,"
eo49YPiwhU4,542280,544770,is one of the most powerful tools in the arsenal
eo49YPiwhU4,544770,547260,of one's own coming-out journey.
eo49YPiwhU4,547260,549932,And one's journey when it comes to realizing
eo49YPiwhU4,549932,552780,"how they want to, first,"
eo49YPiwhU4,552780,554820,speak out loud and proud to the world.
eo49YPiwhU4,554820,557820,"Well, I would love to introduce you to our fabulous stylist."
eo49YPiwhU4,557820,558653,- Okay.
eo49YPiwhU4,558653,559650,"- Amy. - Hi, I'm Amy,"
eo49YPiwhU4,559650,562170,I live in LA and I am a freelance stylist.
eo49YPiwhU4,562170,564180,"I think as soon as you feel better about yourself,"
eo49YPiwhU4,564180,566580,you're kind of exuding that to everybody else around you.
eo49YPiwhU4,566580,568350,And that's exactly what our friends need.
eo49YPiwhU4,568350,569430,- [Eugene] Amy's gonna be the stylist
eo49YPiwhU4,569430,570420,"who's gonna be working with us,"
eo49YPiwhU4,570420,574050,to help realize this next step in your fashion journey.
eo49YPiwhU4,574050,576720,So this is all from your current closet.
eo49YPiwhU4,576720,577553,- Yes.
eo49YPiwhU4,577553,578487,"- I'm gonna grab this, this is a white-"
eo49YPiwhU4,578487,580560,- Amy I love that. - Pantsuit?
eo49YPiwhU4,580560,583260,- I got that from an abandoned
eo49YPiwhU4,583260,586680,"dry cleaners in Lewiston, Maine. (laughs)"
eo49YPiwhU4,586680,587513,- Perfect.
eo49YPiwhU4,587513,589050,How long has this been in your closet?
eo49YPiwhU4,589050,591980,"- It's been embarrassing, nine, eight years?"
eo49YPiwhU4,591980,593519,"- Nine, eight years. - [Amy] Okay."
eo49YPiwhU4,593520,595469,- How about this lovely camo number?
eo49YPiwhU4,595469,598266,"- Oh, that's a little newer, that's maybe seven years."
eo49YPiwhU4,598267,599310,- [Amy] Okay. (Eugene laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,599310,600143,- [Amy] Brand new.
eo49YPiwhU4,600143,601200,- We have this pair of jeans.
eo49YPiwhU4,601200,603750,"- Yes, I brought these to show that I..."
eo49YPiwhU4,603750,605910,"Comfortability, I love these jeans so much,"
eo49YPiwhU4,605910,608779,"that they're even ripping, and I still wear them because-"
eo49YPiwhU4,608779,610471,- (gasps) The crotch ripped?
eo49YPiwhU4,610471,611370,- [Amy] Oh no!
eo49YPiwhU4,611370,612420,- [Eugene] Marcellus!
eo49YPiwhU4,612420,615480,- My theory is whoever's seeing that was supposed to see it.
eo49YPiwhU4,615480,616464,- I can't argue with that.
eo49YPiwhU4,616464,617399,(everyone laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,617400,618417,"- But I look at my closet,"
eo49YPiwhU4,618417,620970,and it's just different colors of the same thing.
eo49YPiwhU4,620970,621803,- Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,621803,625920,"- And it's super easy, but I open up my closet,"
eo49YPiwhU4,625920,627329,and it sort of saddens me.
eo49YPiwhU4,627330,628163,- Oh.
eo49YPiwhU4,628163,630810,- There's so much that goes into everyone's inspiration
eo49YPiwhU4,630810,632100,and their fears.
eo49YPiwhU4,632100,633990,"I should mention, you're also in Palm Springs quite a bit."
eo49YPiwhU4,633990,635459,- Oh. - I am in Palm Springs.
eo49YPiwhU4,635460,637230,- Do you have good Palm Springs outfits?
eo49YPiwhU4,637230,638490,- No. - Oh!
eo49YPiwhU4,638490,640200,- I'm not confident in shorts.
eo49YPiwhU4,640200,641033,- [Amy] Okay. - Why?
eo49YPiwhU4,641033,642073,- Which...
eo49YPiwhU4,642073,642906,I don't know.
eo49YPiwhU4,642906,643739,"- It's very particular,"
eo49YPiwhU4,643739,645270,"for every single queer person's story,"
eo49YPiwhU4,645270,646770,exactly where they want to be at
eo49YPiwhU4,646770,649470,with their own style and wardrobe.
eo49YPiwhU4,649470,651660,There seems to also be a strong blue color palette
eo49YPiwhU4,651661,653353,that I see across the board.
eo49YPiwhU4,653353,655110,"- I never noticed that, how weird."
eo49YPiwhU4,655110,656269,- And you're all in blue too.
eo49YPiwhU4,656269,657750,- I always wear blue uniforms.
eo49YPiwhU4,657750,659160,"- Is it your favorite color,"
eo49YPiwhU4,659160,661110,or is it just the color you used to being in?
eo49YPiwhU4,661110,663415,"- No, my favorite color is red."
eo49YPiwhU4,663415,664649,- And how much red do you wear?
eo49YPiwhU4,664650,667530,"- Not very much, but I think I have one red shirt."
eo49YPiwhU4,667530,668627,That's it. - I love-
eo49YPiwhU4,668627,669822,- Isn't it it weird? - [Amy] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,669822,672294,"- Look at us, we're just digging in and discovering."
eo49YPiwhU4,672294,673127,(laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,673127,675600,"- Well, it's a funny story of going into a shop"
eo49YPiwhU4,675600,678930,"in Beverly Hills, because there was such a beautiful"
eo49YPiwhU4,678930,680430,white leather skirt.
eo49YPiwhU4,680430,683227,"And the poor fellow said,"
eo49YPiwhU4,683227,684330,"""Well, I'll go get it for you."""
eo49YPiwhU4,684330,686520,"I said, ""Well, can we just talk about how much it is first?"""
eo49YPiwhU4,686520,688440,"And you know, he said, ""It's a lot."""
eo49YPiwhU4,688440,691230,"And I said, ""Okay, let's not do that."""
eo49YPiwhU4,691230,692472,"- White leather skirt, you said?"
eo49YPiwhU4,692473,693781,"- It was. - Wow, that sounds"
eo49YPiwhU4,693781,694614,really cool. - And it had
eo49YPiwhU4,694614,695845,"a white leather vest with it, and-"
eo49YPiwhU4,695845,696678,"- [Amy] Oh. - you know,"
eo49YPiwhU4,696678,698160,it would've looked really good.
eo49YPiwhU4,698160,700558,"- My father, he passed away in 2015,"
eo49YPiwhU4,700558,704130,"and I find all these pictures of him, like from the past."
eo49YPiwhU4,704130,704963,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,704963,706350,- [Marcellus] And so I have this picture of him that I love.
eo49YPiwhU4,706350,708630,"And he's just wearing this, what I think, is red."
eo49YPiwhU4,708630,709590,- [Eugene] You're looking to embrace
eo49YPiwhU4,709590,710730,some of that Daddy energy.
eo49YPiwhU4,710730,711563,- [Marcellus] Yeah!
eo49YPiwhU4,711563,714750,"- So we're going from dark, confused,"
eo49YPiwhU4,714750,717180,"and comfortable, to purposeful-"
eo49YPiwhU4,717180,719490,"- Yep. - colorful, and confident."
eo49YPiwhU4,719490,720323,- Confident.
eo49YPiwhU4,720323,722040,- I think I'm more interesting than this on the inside.
eo49YPiwhU4,722040,723930,"- Yeah, I think so too."
eo49YPiwhU4,723930,725850,We're gonna have a really great time and...
eo49YPiwhU4,725850,726753,"- Yeah, I'm for super excited."
eo49YPiwhU4,726753,728146,- I can't wait for Amy to-
eo49YPiwhU4,728146,729240,- Looking forward to it. - pull some out for you.
eo49YPiwhU4,729240,731224,"- Yeah, it's gonna be fun."
eo49YPiwhU4,731224,732930,(upbeat music)
eo49YPiwhU4,732930,734040,- [Eugene] Hey Marcellus.
eo49YPiwhU4,734040,735435,"- [Marcellus] Hello, hello."
eo49YPiwhU4,735435,737370,"- Hi, welcome back."
eo49YPiwhU4,737370,739710,"- Yes, I see you've embraced color again this week."
eo49YPiwhU4,739710,741840,- Yes. (everyone laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,741840,742740,- Gotta be bright.
eo49YPiwhU4,742740,746138,"- So I remember last week, you showed us your jeans."
eo49YPiwhU4,746138,748920,"So we got you some new jeans,"
eo49YPiwhU4,748920,750570,and there's no holes in the bottom.
eo49YPiwhU4,750570,751403,- Perfect. (laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,751403,752310,- So we're gonna start by...
eo49YPiwhU4,752310,756150,Let's like elevate your uniform first before we go crazy.
eo49YPiwhU4,756150,759165,So why don't we just start with pair of jeans
eo49YPiwhU4,759165,761190,with a nice biker jacket.
eo49YPiwhU4,761190,762023,"- Oh, cool."
eo49YPiwhU4,762023,763233,- And a tank.
eo49YPiwhU4,764460,765930,- Ooh. (Amy and Eugene laugh)
eo49YPiwhU4,765930,767910,"- I thought we could do like a little monochrome look,"
eo49YPiwhU4,767910,771149,and we can add a couple layers to kind of break it up too.
eo49YPiwhU4,771150,773220,- [Marcellus] I'm coming.
eo49YPiwhU4,773220,774053,- Wow.
eo49YPiwhU4,775140,776179,Gay.
eo49YPiwhU4,776179,778110,(everyone laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,778110,780870,"Reminder, these are gays."
eo49YPiwhU4,780870,783570,"Now, what was your shopping process like for Marcellus?"
eo49YPiwhU4,783570,786420,"- I really wanted to push him a little bit,"
eo49YPiwhU4,786420,788159,"in terms of color, but I also wanted him"
eo49YPiwhU4,788159,790547,to have some good basics.
eo49YPiwhU4,790547,792840,"- Oh, this is a nice color on you."
eo49YPiwhU4,792840,793763,"- Yes, it's a gorgeous color on me."
eo49YPiwhU4,793763,794790,"- I love, yeah."
eo49YPiwhU4,794790,797579,"- Normally I would, honestly, probably be a little afraid"
eo49YPiwhU4,797580,798840,"to go for something like this,"
eo49YPiwhU4,798840,802050,mainly because I don't know what color it is.
eo49YPiwhU4,802050,803459,- Someone could say it's a mint green.
eo49YPiwhU4,803460,805410,Someone could say it's like a winter green.
eo49YPiwhU4,805410,807173,People don't even know what color this is.
eo49YPiwhU4,807174,808007,- Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,808007,808840,- [Eugene] Because it's not a standard color.
eo49YPiwhU4,808840,810240,"- And you have a great dark jean on,"
eo49YPiwhU4,810240,811707,so you can basically pair anything with it.
eo49YPiwhU4,811707,814672,- And now you only have one hole on your butt
eo49YPiwhU4,814672,816178,"- Where it belongs. - [Eugene] Where it belongs,"
eo49YPiwhU4,816178,817860,the special hole.
eo49YPiwhU4,817860,819690,- I was also inspired by the photo of his dad
eo49YPiwhU4,819690,820523,that he showed us.
eo49YPiwhU4,820523,823559,"I love these like, red hues that we pulled."
eo49YPiwhU4,823559,825270,- Speaking of color and pattern...
eo49YPiwhU4,825270,826230,- Oh yes.
eo49YPiwhU4,826230,827182,- I love.
eo49YPiwhU4,827182,828420,- [Amy] This is so nice.
eo49YPiwhU4,828420,829511,- This fells like me.
eo49YPiwhU4,829511,830459,- Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,830460,833023,"- It feels like I'm saying something,"
eo49YPiwhU4,833023,834840,I just feel really comfortable with it too.
eo49YPiwhU4,834840,836837,"But I like, feel like it stands out."
eo49YPiwhU4,836837,838800,"- See, a And those are colors that people just say,"
eo49YPiwhU4,838800,840180,"yellow, red- - Yeah."
eo49YPiwhU4,840180,841440,- and black. - Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,841440,843420,"- So that's the thing, colorblind, who cares?"
eo49YPiwhU4,843420,845399,"- Right, this will be easy for me to pick,"
eo49YPiwhU4,845400,846957,"because I would say, ""Yeah, that's yellow."""
eo49YPiwhU4,846957,848288,- You just be mustard. - Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,848289,849270,(everyone laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,849270,851430,"Literally say a color that's not standard,"
eo49YPiwhU4,851430,852263,and no one can disagree.
eo49YPiwhU4,852263,853096,"They're like, ""What color is that?"""
eo49YPiwhU4,853096,854850,"You say, ""Rust."" - Brick."
eo49YPiwhU4,854850,856620,- Brick. (everyone laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,856620,857640,"Have we always had this,"
eo49YPiwhU4,857640,860490,or was this constructed special for us?
eo49YPiwhU4,860490,861690,"Wow, I'm gonna need to use this."
eo49YPiwhU4,861690,863730,"We always just change in front of each other in the office,"
eo49YPiwhU4,863730,865410,which I think is an HR violation.
eo49YPiwhU4,865410,866339,- [Amy] Probably.
eo49YPiwhU4,866340,867848,"- Oh, you ready?"
eo49YPiwhU4,867848,869517,"- Oh, this is nice."
eo49YPiwhU4,869517,870350,"- Yeah, that's so cute."
eo49YPiwhU4,870350,872402,- These pants hit you just where I wanted them to.
eo49YPiwhU4,872402,873235,- Perfectly.
eo49YPiwhU4,873235,874890,"- Yeah, like a nice ankle cut."
eo49YPiwhU4,874890,878370,"- Also, Ally maybe came in with the strongest personal style"
eo49YPiwhU4,878370,879660,that was established already.
eo49YPiwhU4,879660,881399,"- Yes, and I know she just wanted like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,881400,882900,elevated versions of that.
eo49YPiwhU4,882900,885090,- I love the monochromatic look of it.
eo49YPiwhU4,885090,886393,- This is a strolling outfit.
eo49YPiwhU4,886393,887226,- It's a strolling....
eo49YPiwhU4,887226,888930,"Yeah, this is casual, every day."
eo49YPiwhU4,888930,890730,"- There's already like a personal vision there,"
eo49YPiwhU4,890730,892445,that now you're just sort of giving options for her.
eo49YPiwhU4,892445,893278,- [Amy] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,893278,896100,"- I love this type of outerwear for just being like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,896100,898170,"feminine and flowing and casual,"
eo49YPiwhU4,898170,900149,"but also like, a little punch of something."
eo49YPiwhU4,900150,901590,I think we should maybe then take her
eo49YPiwhU4,901590,902940,into something a little more structured.
eo49YPiwhU4,902940,904770,"- Yeah, we're definitely going from very flowy,"
eo49YPiwhU4,904770,906000,to very structured.
eo49YPiwhU4,906000,907230,"- [Eugene] Okay, yes."
eo49YPiwhU4,907230,910440,"Is there anything that you feel like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,910440,914430,"as you are here talking to like, the public about-"
eo49YPiwhU4,914430,915263,- [Ally] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,915263,918000,"- what it means to you just to be able to live as you are,"
eo49YPiwhU4,918000,919530,and have people support you in that?
eo49YPiwhU4,919530,922980,"- Sure, so I was the Gay Straight Alliance Advisor"
eo49YPiwhU4,922980,925440,"for my school, so I've worked with a lot of trans kids,"
eo49YPiwhU4,925440,926550,especially in the middle school.
eo49YPiwhU4,926550,928410,"They're trying to figure it out, or they're queer kids,"
eo49YPiwhU4,928410,930662,"or they're straight kids, who are just there to be allies."
eo49YPiwhU4,930663,933388,"- Yes, that is so cute. - Very nice."
eo49YPiwhU4,933388,934221,- Yeah. - Thank you.
eo49YPiwhU4,934221,935460,- Yes! - This is so classic.
eo49YPiwhU4,935460,939720,"- To be able to be me, took some time."
eo49YPiwhU4,939720,941550,"- It's not necessarily super form fitting,"
eo49YPiwhU4,941550,943740,so it doesn't feel like you're going somewhere super formal.
eo49YPiwhU4,943740,946410,"So you could wear this out to like a dinner,"
eo49YPiwhU4,946410,947399,or to an audition.
eo49YPiwhU4,947400,951153,- And there's always obstacles and overcoming those.
eo49YPiwhU4,952410,953670,It's nice to have allies.
eo49YPiwhU4,953670,955920,As I transition through those teen years
eo49YPiwhU4,955920,957120,of the transition woman-
eo49YPiwhU4,957120,958125,- Yes. - you know?
eo49YPiwhU4,958125,961050,I tried all those little form-fitting things.
eo49YPiwhU4,961050,961883,- [Eugene] Yes.
eo49YPiwhU4,961883,962716,"- And they're not me, that's not..."
eo49YPiwhU4,962716,964020,it doesn't fit with who I am.
eo49YPiwhU4,964020,964853,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,964853,965970,- So this feels fantastic.
eo49YPiwhU4,965970,967680,"- It's like breezy, but also like youthful at the same time."
eo49YPiwhU4,967680,968700,"- It's youthful, yeah."
eo49YPiwhU4,968700,969690,I think a little black dress
eo49YPiwhU4,969690,971388,is the most classic thing you can have.
eo49YPiwhU4,971388,972221,- Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,972221,973054,- And there are other ways
eo49YPiwhU4,973054,973887,"you can dress it up and down, right?"
eo49YPiwhU4,973887,975960,"- Yes, so this is kind of adding your style to this."
eo49YPiwhU4,975960,976827,"- Ooh, yes!"
eo49YPiwhU4,976827,979470,"- This is Ally, this is kind of like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,979470,981930,"very soft, lightweight jacket."
eo49YPiwhU4,981930,984240,"- But I think that the thing that's important to me,"
eo49YPiwhU4,984240,986459,"as I've gone through, and if I'm to be at peace"
eo49YPiwhU4,986460,989580,"with who I am, is to be able to spread that message"
eo49YPiwhU4,989580,992235,"to other people, that you're enough."
eo49YPiwhU4,992235,994890,"- [Eugene] Yeah. - And be you,"
eo49YPiwhU4,994890,999120,"there's only you, that the world needs you."
eo49YPiwhU4,999120,1001070,"- Yes, so this is just kind of an easy way"
eo49YPiwhU4,1001070,1002210,"to layer this dress,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1002210,1004230,and maybe make it a little bit more casual.
eo49YPiwhU4,1004230,1005120,- Yeah. - Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1005120,1006170,- That's super cute too.
eo49YPiwhU4,1006170,1007003,- [Ally] I love it.
eo49YPiwhU4,1007003,1007836,"Like, I really have nothing..."
eo49YPiwhU4,1007836,1011090,"especially something that's this kind of cut,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1011090,1012500,with this kind of softness.
eo49YPiwhU4,1012500,1013333,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1013333,1014166,- And I love that.
eo49YPiwhU4,1014166,1015615,- All right.
eo49YPiwhU4,1015615,1016730,Okay. - [Eugene] Oh yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1016730,1017899,- This is cute.
eo49YPiwhU4,1017900,1019880,- I feel awesome.
eo49YPiwhU4,1019880,1020750,- [Amy] Yes!
eo49YPiwhU4,1020750,1022340,- Like I need a motorcycle or something.
eo49YPiwhU4,1022340,1024464,"- Yes, now do you not have a leather jacket?"
eo49YPiwhU4,1024464,1025297,- [Amy] I love it.
eo49YPiwhU4,1025297,1028053,"- I do, but it's like a brown puffy jacket, it's not black."
eo49YPiwhU4,1028053,1028886,"- [Amy] Oh, no, this is cool."
eo49YPiwhU4,1028886,1031370,"- Not a fitted biker-inspired one,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1031370,1033110,'cause this is like the classic biker cut.
eo49YPiwhU4,1033110,1034730,"- It's fun, and then let's see the top under."
eo49YPiwhU4,1034730,1036650,- Oh yeah. - It has a little peplum vibe.
eo49YPiwhU4,1036650,1037670,- Serving body.
eo49YPiwhU4,1037670,1039050,"- [Amy] Serving, yeah."
eo49YPiwhU4,1039050,1039980,Show off the waist.
eo49YPiwhU4,1039980,1041240,"- It's a knitted tank,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1041240,1043160,somewhere between a sweater-
eo49YPiwhU4,1043160,1044089,- Yes. - and a regular tank top?
eo49YPiwhU4,1044089,1045409,"- Yeah, so it's dressy."
eo49YPiwhU4,1045410,1046640,And some of her inspirations
eo49YPiwhU4,1046640,1048110,"were some characters from ""The L Word""."
eo49YPiwhU4,1048110,1048973,- [Eugene] Yes.
eo49YPiwhU4,1048973,1050330,- And there was a power suit. - Yes.
eo49YPiwhU4,1050330,1051830,"- And also kind of like a real cool, sexy-"
eo49YPiwhU4,1051830,1052663,- Kind of rockery...
eo49YPiwhU4,1052663,1053960,- [Amy] Rock-and-roll vibes.
eo49YPiwhU4,1053960,1056427,We might hit a little bit of both of those today.
eo49YPiwhU4,1056427,1058190,"- It is cute. - [Eugene] Yeah, this is cute."
eo49YPiwhU4,1058190,1059179,- Let's adjust the sleeves.
eo49YPiwhU4,1059180,1060440,"- Yeah, let's give you a little..."
eo49YPiwhU4,1060440,1062706,"- Again, it has that relaxing feel to it,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1062707,1064700,but I feel like I'm dressed up.
eo49YPiwhU4,1064700,1066080,- Yeah. - This shirt actually has
eo49YPiwhU4,1066080,1068990,"the very strong, like traditional masculine cut,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1068990,1070520,because it has the wide cuff and everything.
eo49YPiwhU4,1070520,1072260,"- Yeah. - Wide cuff, wide lapel."
eo49YPiwhU4,1072260,1074930,"So that's why you have to do things like maybe push it up,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1074930,1076520,"open this up a bit just to give it like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1076520,1078950,"something that's a little less like, businessman."
eo49YPiwhU4,1078950,1080659,"- Yeah, and maybe add like a little necklace here."
eo49YPiwhU4,1080660,1081530,- Necklace. - Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1081530,1082819,- Accessorize it up.
eo49YPiwhU4,1082819,1084357,"- [Eugene] Oh, it's a great color on you."
eo49YPiwhU4,1084358,1085191,- [Amy] Oh this is so pretty.
eo49YPiwhU4,1085191,1086930,"- First of all, I love the fabric."
eo49YPiwhU4,1086930,1088970,- [Amy] It kind of has a sheen to it.
eo49YPiwhU4,1088970,1092179,"- Yes, and how it feels, and nevermind the color."
eo49YPiwhU4,1092180,1094480,"- The color's great, I love this color on you."
eo49YPiwhU4,1095764,1096597,- All right. - [Eugene] Perfect.
eo49YPiwhU4,1096597,1097846,[Amy] T-shirt and pants.
eo49YPiwhU4,1097846,1098809,- [Eugene] Not out of the comfort zone.
eo49YPiwhU4,1098810,1099643,- [Amy] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1099643,1103460,- So we have just a basic Tee and Chino's.
eo49YPiwhU4,1103460,1106491,"- Which, as basic as you're saying it is,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1106491,1109520,this is not something I would choose; I'm afraid of white.
eo49YPiwhU4,1109520,1110353,- [Amy] Okay.
eo49YPiwhU4,1110353,1113150,- Because I feel like black just covers everything.
eo49YPiwhU4,1113150,1114410,"It's just slimming,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1114410,1116300,so I would never opt for just a white T-shirt.
eo49YPiwhU4,1116300,1119300,"it's a nice palette, like it's a canvas."
eo49YPiwhU4,1119300,1120133,- Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1120133,1122330,- For which you can paint layers on.
eo49YPiwhU4,1122330,1124370,There's a difference between basics and staples.
eo49YPiwhU4,1124370,1125203,- Yes. - Right?
eo49YPiwhU4,1125203,1126036,- That is so true.
eo49YPiwhU4,1126036,1128330,- So a lot of people just keep overloading their closet
eo49YPiwhU4,1128330,1130012,with the same basics in different colors-
eo49YPiwhU4,1130012,1130845,- [Amy] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1130845,1131900,- when really you should be loading your closet
eo49YPiwhU4,1131900,1133001,with staples. - [Amy] Yes.
eo49YPiwhU4,1133001,1134929,"So I think this is just something you can throw on for work,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1134930,1136640,and look a little more...
eo49YPiwhU4,1136640,1137473,- This feels really nice.
eo49YPiwhU4,1137473,1138920,"- Polished, yeah, it looks really good."
eo49YPiwhU4,1138920,1140150,- Good job. - [Amy] Yay!
eo49YPiwhU4,1140150,1141797,- How come you did this without me even trying things on
eo49YPiwhU4,1141797,1142940,and it fits perfectly?
eo49YPiwhU4,1142940,1144226,"When I go to a dressing room,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1144226,1146230,I'm going through like the whole... (laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,1146230,1147919,"- [Amy] So I feel like all of these was like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1147920,1148977,shopping for a loved one.
eo49YPiwhU4,1148977,1150350,"""Okay, where would Nick wear this?"
eo49YPiwhU4,1150350,1152299,"Where would Nick go in Palm Springs with this?"""
eo49YPiwhU4,1152300,1155750,"- If I saw myself in this, without you here,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1155750,1157430,I would completely doubt myself.
eo49YPiwhU4,1157430,1158263,"- [Amy] Oh, no."
eo49YPiwhU4,1158263,1159507,"- I would say, ""I can't pull this off."""
eo49YPiwhU4,1159508,1160370,- [Eugene] That looks great. - Yeah?
eo49YPiwhU4,1160370,1162543,"- And if you wanted, you could also roll these up a bit."
eo49YPiwhU4,1162543,1163391,- This is a great color on you.
eo49YPiwhU4,1163391,1164362,- [Nick] This is a '50s vibe.
eo49YPiwhU4,1164362,1165380,"- Well, very Palm Springs as well."
eo49YPiwhU4,1165380,1166213,- [Nick] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1166213,1167237,"- So this is like a track-jacket style,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1167237,1169169,"and the colors are still safe, in terms of like-"
eo49YPiwhU4,1169169,1170002,- [Nick] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1170002,1170899,- you're going bold with the print.
eo49YPiwhU4,1170900,1171733,- [Amy] Yeah. - But the colors
eo49YPiwhU4,1171733,1172566,are very muted.
eo49YPiwhU4,1172566,1174644,Some people think fashion is like multiplication.
eo49YPiwhU4,1174644,1177260,"I have to like, blow myself up to be fashionable."
eo49YPiwhU4,1177260,1178820,But sometimes it's just basic addition.
eo49YPiwhU4,1178820,1179680,- [Nick] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1179681,1180895,"- You're just like, boom, here's a jacket."
eo49YPiwhU4,1180895,1181728,- [Nick] Right.
eo49YPiwhU4,1181728,1182595,- [Eugene] Now I'm a different me.
eo49YPiwhU4,1182595,1184147,- [Amy] Exactly.
eo49YPiwhU4,1184147,1185455,"- Okay, cute!"
eo49YPiwhU4,1185456,1186500,- [Amy] Oh yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1186500,1188170,"- Wow, another pair of perfect fitting jeans."
eo49YPiwhU4,1188170,1189170,- [Amy] Yes.
eo49YPiwhU4,1190337,1191170,Okay. - [Eugene] That's so pretty.
eo49YPiwhU4,1191170,1192399,- This is a nice color on you.
eo49YPiwhU4,1192399,1194390,"- [Eugene] Yes, this is a great color."
eo49YPiwhU4,1194390,1195320,- [Amy] Red looks really nice on you.
eo49YPiwhU4,1195320,1196366,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1196366,1197361,- The suit is comfortable too.
eo49YPiwhU4,1197361,1198194,- [Eugene] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1198194,1199640,"- I like the length of this too, it's not super short,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1199640,1201890,"it's kind of long, it has like, an oversized vibe,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1201890,1202790,but not here.
eo49YPiwhU4,1202790,1204177,"A lot of people have said,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1204177,1205190,"""Oh, I won't look good in this,"""
eo49YPiwhU4,1205190,1206450,"because in their mind they won't,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1206450,1207470,but they haven't put it on.
eo49YPiwhU4,1207470,1209090,So how would they know?
eo49YPiwhU4,1209090,1211190,"- [Nick] All right, these shorts feel..."
eo49YPiwhU4,1211190,1212299,- [Eugene] Perfect?
eo49YPiwhU4,1212300,1213653,"- [Nick] Short, here we go."
eo49YPiwhU4,1214910,1217810,"- [Amy] Oh, no, they're a good length."
eo49YPiwhU4,1217810,1218643,- [Nick] Yeah?
eo49YPiwhU4,1218643,1219476,- [Eugene] Those are a perfect length.
eo49YPiwhU4,1219476,1220309,You have great legs.
eo49YPiwhU4,1220309,1221510,"- [Amy] Yeah, you do have great legs."
eo49YPiwhU4,1221510,1222343,- [Eugene] Look at those calves.
eo49YPiwhU4,1222343,1224067,- Can't say that I love it. - [Amy] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1224067,1225599,"I don't feel like I don't look good in them,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1225599,1226432,"'cause I mean, it's working. - [Amy] Right."
eo49YPiwhU4,1226432,1228140,"I think it's a confidence issue,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1228140,1230628,and I think it's what people are used to.
eo49YPiwhU4,1230628,1232805,- I'm not loving myself in it.
eo49YPiwhU4,1232805,1233638,- [Amy] Okay.
eo49YPiwhU4,1233638,1234559,I think it looks great on you.
eo49YPiwhU4,1234560,1235500,"- [Eugene] No, it's great."
eo49YPiwhU4,1235500,1236939,"- [Nick] All right, I think I just need to get used to it."
eo49YPiwhU4,1236939,1237772,- [Amy] Yeah.
eo49YPiwhU4,1237772,1238605,And it's your favorite color?
eo49YPiwhU4,1238605,1239712,"- Yes, I like it."
eo49YPiwhU4,1239712,1240800,- [Eugene] How do you feel about it?
eo49YPiwhU4,1240800,1241760,"- Yeah? - [Eugene] Oh yeah,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1241760,1243320,this is great. - It's such a good pink.
eo49YPiwhU4,1243320,1245022,- I have to keep your voices in my head
eo49YPiwhU4,1245022,1246230,when I'm on my own. - Yes.
eo49YPiwhU4,1246230,1247398,"- It's just having the staple pieces,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1247399,1250010,and know how to change it up.
eo49YPiwhU4,1250010,1251744,"- We'll present a few looks to each person,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1251744,1254420,and then reveal the final look that they love the most
eo49YPiwhU4,1254420,1256100,"to their loved ones. - Yes, I love it."
eo49YPiwhU4,1256100,1257210,I'm so excited.
eo49YPiwhU4,1257210,1259520,- [Nick] Can I say I fucking love this?
eo49YPiwhU4,1259520,1260353,- [Crew] You can. - Okay.
eo49YPiwhU4,1260353,1262555,- [Amy] You can. - I just did. (laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,1262555,1265850,(mellow music)
eo49YPiwhU4,1265850,1267590,- [Eugene] And who are you gonna be bringing in next week
eo49YPiwhU4,1267590,1271130,"to reveal this next stage, Marcellus?"
eo49YPiwhU4,1271130,1273320,"- So one of my closest friends,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1273320,1274429,"his name is Kenneth Brown,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1274430,1276830,and he's one of my favorite people to show stuff to.
eo49YPiwhU4,1276830,1278840,"And when I tell him I bought a new jacket,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1278840,1280173,"he's always the one that tells me, like,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1280173,1281006,"""Oh, I don't know..."""
eo49YPiwhU4,1281006,1281929,"- Oh, so he's the judgmental friend."
eo49YPiwhU4,1281930,1285388,"- Oh, he's very judgmental, but in a great way."
eo49YPiwhU4,1285388,1286724,- And his name's Kenneth?
eo49YPiwhU4,1286724,1287612,"- Kenneth, yes."
eo49YPiwhU4,1287612,1290030,- And would you say you are the more
eo49YPiwhU4,1290030,1292520,fashion-conscious between the two of you?
eo49YPiwhU4,1292520,1295250,"- Absolutely, definitely more fashion conscious,"
eo49YPiwhU4,1295250,1297708,"more fashion forward, more fashion advocate."
eo49YPiwhU4,1297708,1299300,(Eugene laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,1299300,1301190,- So he's a fashion villain?
eo49YPiwhU4,1301190,1303501,"- Yes, he's my community service."
eo49YPiwhU4,1303501,1305000,(everyone laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,1305000,1306392,"- Oh, Marcellus warned about you."
eo49YPiwhU4,1306392,1307304,- A Leo.
eo49YPiwhU4,1307304,1308899,"- A Leo? - [Amy] Oh, a Leo."
eo49YPiwhU4,1308900,1309733,- [Eugene] Trash. I'm kidding.
eo49YPiwhU4,1309733,1311007,(everyone laughs)
eo49YPiwhU4,1311007,1313850,"- ,Marcellus lives in the city of black and gray."
eo49YPiwhU4,1313850,1315470,and I'm really trying to get him
eo49YPiwhU4,1315470,1317330,to put a down payment on a city of color.
eo49YPiwhU4,1317330,1320672,"- Ken, are you ready to meet Marcellus 2.0?"
eo49YPiwhU4,1320672,1322940,- [Kenneth] I'm so ready to meet Marcellus 2.0.
eo49YPiwhU4,1322940,1324620,- [Eugene] How would you intro Marcellus
eo49YPiwhU4,1324620,1325970,if he was coming into the ball?
