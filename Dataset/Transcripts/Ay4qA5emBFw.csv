Ay4qA5emBFw,160800,162879,over there i was hoping for more i
Ay4qA5emBFw,162879,164720,thought it would be worth a lot more but
Ay4qA5emBFw,164720,166720,i guess it's just not worth that much
Ay4qA5emBFw,166720,168000,what you got here
Ay4qA5emBFw,168000,170720,it's a uh 1983
Ay4qA5emBFw,170720,173760,seiko tv watch as seen in the james bond
Ay4qA5emBFw,173760,176480,film octopussy no way dude you have the
Ay4qA5emBFw,176480,178959,watch from octopussy yep what's cooler
Ay4qA5emBFw,178959,180400,than wearing the same watch as james
Ay4qA5emBFw,180400,182480,bond exactly it's the original smart
Ay4qA5emBFw,182480,184159,watch
Ay4qA5emBFw,184159,185680,i got the tv watch when i was about nine
Ay4qA5emBFw,185680,187280,or ten years old i won it in a raffle
Ay4qA5emBFw,187280,188879,from a jewelry store i got to play with
Ay4qA5emBFw,188879,190879,it once or twice and then got put back
Ay4qA5emBFw,190879,192239,in the box probably because i was a
Ay4qA5emBFw,192239,194000,nine-year-old i was hoping to get about
Ay4qA5emBFw,194000,196000,800 for it and you know i'd like to see
Ay4qA5emBFw,196000,197040,what they want to offer me for it see
Ay4qA5emBFw,197040,200400,what it's worth oh this thing's sweet
Ay4qA5emBFw,200400,202640,in the 1980s seiko was just ahead of
Ay4qA5emBFw,202640,204080,their time when it came to watches they
Ay4qA5emBFw,204080,206000,were innovative and they were pushing
Ay4qA5emBFw,206000,206799,the
Ay4qA5emBFw,206799,208720,market just to a whole new level i mean
Ay4qA5emBFw,208720,210239,seiko had a couple other watches at the
Ay4qA5emBFw,210239,212239,time they had one that had recording
Ay4qA5emBFw,212239,214319,technologies and even made a computer
Ay4qA5emBFw,214319,216319,functioning watch we're talking the
Ay4qA5emBFw,216319,218239,1980s
Ay4qA5emBFw,218239,219360,when this watch came out there was
Ay4qA5emBFw,219360,220720,nothing like it
Ay4qA5emBFw,220720,222640,this was actually the smallest tv set in
Ay4qA5emBFw,222640,224560,the world
Ay4qA5emBFw,224560,226080,it's funny to think this is a smart
Ay4qA5emBFw,226080,227599,watch now because
Ay4qA5emBFw,227599,229440,it's got this big giant receiver right
Ay4qA5emBFw,229440,230400,here
Ay4qA5emBFw,230400,231920,and i imagine you got to put this in
Ay4qA5emBFw,231920,233040,your pocket
Ay4qA5emBFw,233040,235040,walk around with it
Ay4qA5emBFw,235040,236640,yeah the idea was you hook this wire up
Ay4qA5emBFw,236640,238239,to the watch and then run it up your
Ay4qA5emBFw,238239,239920,sleeve and keep that thing in your shirt
Ay4qA5emBFw,239920,241840,pocket and i think they even recommended
Ay4qA5emBFw,241840,243760,that you hook a wire up so you can watch
Ay4qA5emBFw,243760,245599,it on your vcr you might be able to do
Ay4qA5emBFw,245599,247040,that yeah i'm not sure i never got to do
Ay4qA5emBFw,247040,248959,that does it work i think it does i mean
Ay4qA5emBFw,248959,250480,the watch itself keeps time i actually
Ay4qA5emBFw,250480,252080,haven't turned it on to see if the if
Ay4qA5emBFw,252080,253760,the tv comes through and then quite some
Ay4qA5emBFw,253760,255360,time so okay well you got the plug right
Ay4qA5emBFw,255360,256959,here you mind if i try it out yeah let's
Ay4qA5emBFw,256959,258880,check it out all right
Ay4qA5emBFw,258880,260239,back in the day this watch was
Ay4qA5emBFw,260239,262800,considered super high-tech and everybody
Ay4qA5emBFw,262800,264080,wanted it
Ay4qA5emBFw,264080,266080,it's in really great condition so i
Ay4qA5emBFw,266080,268479,could probably find a buyer for it
Ay4qA5emBFw,268479,271360,or i could take it home myself
Ay4qA5emBFw,271360,274400,oh switch it to tv
Ay4qA5emBFw,275919,278000,it's got the fuzzy cereal um imagine you
Ay4qA5emBFw,278000,279600,don't get an adapter for this you can't
Ay4qA5emBFw,279600,283280,actually get a picture on it
Ay4qA5emBFw,283280,286320,so um how much are you looking for
Ay4qA5emBFw,286320,288080,i've seen them sell online for upwards
Ay4qA5emBFw,288080,289840,of about a thousand bucks and was hoping
Ay4qA5emBFw,289840,293040,to get like 800 bucks out of it
Ay4qA5emBFw,293520,295280,i just don't see it bringing that much
Ay4qA5emBFw,295280,298000,um i think we sold one for uh
Ay4qA5emBFw,298000,299919,right around three hundred dollars
Ay4qA5emBFw,299919,301120,yeah you know was it in this good
Ay4qA5emBFw,301120,303199,condition i mean this is all original

Ay4qA5emBFw,307440,309440,understand as cool as it is you know
Ay4qA5emBFw,309440,311199,it's just a collector's item because you
Ay4qA5emBFw,311199,314800,can't actually watch tv on it
Ay4qA5emBFw,315120,316560,i mean we're looking

Ay4qA5emBFw,384000,385600,on the planet
Ay4qA5emBFw,385600,387520,and uh
Ay4qA5emBFw,387520,390560,this changed everything
Ay4qA5emBFw,391360,393680,i'm at the pawn shop to sell my sony
Ay4qA5emBFw,393680,396720,guys and dolls special edition walkman i
Ay4qA5emBFw,396720,398720,would like to get a thousand dollars to
Ay4qA5emBFw,398720,400960,take my family on vacation but i'm not
Ay4qA5emBFw,400960,403759,going to take less than 600.
Ay4qA5emBFw,403759,405600,sony came out with this and sort of
Ay4qA5emBFw,405600,407520,changed portable music altogether i mean
Ay4qA5emBFw,407520,410080,it truly was revolutionary
Ay4qA5emBFw,410080,411840,before this there really wasn't anything
Ay4qA5emBFw,411840,414319,that was portable and practical right
Ay4qA5emBFw,414319,416400,there was transistor radios that were
Ay4qA5emBFw,416400,418240,before this but quite frankly they
Ay4qA5emBFw,418240,420160,sucked there was terrible reception they
Ay4qA5emBFw,420160,422560,were mono they weren't stereo you know
Ay4qA5emBFw,422560,424080,the cassette tape you know basically
Ay4qA5emBFw,424080,426400,came out in 1979 there was the boom
Ay4qA5emBFw,426400,428000,boxes and everything like that but you
Ay4qA5emBFw,428000,430080,can't really go jogging with like a
Ay4qA5emBFw,430080,431120,boombox
Ay4qA5emBFw,431120,433840,shoulder you know what i mean
Ay4qA5emBFw,434000,435759,when they first came out with it they
Ay4qA5emBFw,435759,437360,thought it would be rather
Ay4qA5emBFw,437360,439120,rude to be walking around with
Ay4qA5emBFw,439120,440479,headphones on
Ay4qA5emBFw,440479,441360,so
Ay4qA5emBFw,441360,443199,they put two headphone jacks in it and
Ay4qA5emBFw,443199,444720,all their advertising were two people
Ay4qA5emBFw,444720,447520,listening to music and they very quickly
Ay4qA5emBFw,447520,448880,realized that people didn't have a
Ay4qA5emBFw,448880,450639,problem being anti-social and walking
Ay4qA5emBFw,450639,452960,around with headphones on and almost 30
Ay4qA5emBFw,452960,456560,years i've yelled at kids for doing that
Ay4qA5emBFw,456560,458800,so does it work it does

Ay4qA5emBFw,461039,462240,play
Ay4qA5emBFw,462240,463360,okay
Ay4qA5emBFw,463360,465199,i know there was like a really limited
Ay4qA5emBFw,465199,466479,number of them they put the guys and
Ay4qA5emBFw,466479,469039,dolls on correct that's the one that
Ay4qA5emBFw,469039,471039,everybody wants it's a neat thing to be
Ay4qA5emBFw,471039,472879,having on yourself
Ay4qA5emBFw,472879,474560,how much you want for it

Ay4qA5emBFw,574720,577440,all the manuals
Ay4qA5emBFw,577440,580720,the computer printer in uh 1982 i got
Ay4qA5emBFw,580720,582880,one of these things and i actually wrote
Ay4qA5emBFw,582880,585600,a spreadsheet on it and then when i want
Ay4qA5emBFw,585600,587839,to print out a report i'd press a button
Ay4qA5emBFw,587839,591279,and wait for like 15 minutes
Ay4qA5emBFw,591279,591930,and then it would print
Ay4qA5emBFw,591930,595440,[Laughter]
Ay4qA5emBFw,595440,597680,i bought the computer in the early 80s
Ay4qA5emBFw,597680,600880,and used it for a few years updated and
Ay4qA5emBFw,600880,603519,now it's been sitting in my garage i'd
Ay4qA5emBFw,603519,606160,like to sell it just to clean things out
Ay4qA5emBFw,606160,608160,and maybe get a few bucks to go out to
Ay4qA5emBFw,608160,609120,dinner
Ay4qA5emBFw,609120,611360,this is absolutely amazing for the time
Ay4qA5emBFw,611360,613120,it was really really innovative they
Ay4qA5emBFw,613120,615680,figured out a way to package
Ay4qA5emBFw,615680,617680,a computer you know keyboard everything
Ay4qA5emBFw,617680,619600,in this little box
Ay4qA5emBFw,619600,621040,and it didn't need a monitor because you
Ay4qA5emBFw,621040,622880,could plug it straight into your tv god
Ay4qA5emBFw,622880,626399,it doesn't seem like that long ago
Ay4qA5emBFw,626480,627360,so
Ay4qA5emBFw,627360,629440,does it work it works you want to plug
Ay4qA5emBFw,629440,631839,it in yeah let me plug it in jose can
Ay4qA5emBFw,631839,633279,you grab me uh one of the old computer
Ay4qA5emBFw,633279,635519,monitors yes rick
Ay4qA5emBFw,635519,637600,so did you use it much
Ay4qA5emBFw,637600,639920,kind of like you i bought it early found
Ay4qA5emBFw,639920,642240,out that i could get something better a
Ay4qA5emBFw,642240,644320,few years later and it's been boxed up
Ay4qA5emBFw,644320,648000,sitting in my garage ever since okay
Ay4qA5emBFw,648160,649200,who's the last time you turned this
Ay4qA5emBFw,649200,650959,thing on
Ay4qA5emBFw,650959,652399,uh
Ay4qA5emBFw,652399,655760,probably a couple of years look at that
Ay4qA5emBFw,656320,657519,that's great
Ay4qA5emBFw,657519,660480,whose 64k ram system
Ay4qA5emBFw,660480,664000,38 911 basic bytes free
Ay4qA5emBFw,664000,666240,so just by turning it on you took up
Ay4qA5emBFw,666240,669279,almost half the memory
Ay4qA5emBFw,672480,673360,steve
Ay4qA5emBFw,673360,675839,rick

Ay4qA5emBFw,677920,680800,i'm interested in it um
Ay4qA5emBFw,680800,682880,so how much you want for this thing
Ay4qA5emBFw,682880,687079,i think 250 would be fair

Ay4qA5emBFw,732880,734639,that was ever made uh it was my
Ay4qA5emBFw,734639,736880,grandmother's i found it in the garage
Ay4qA5emBFw,736880,738000,is this what you used to count jelly
Ay4qA5emBFw,738000,739760,beans with when you were a kid no sign
Ay4qA5emBFw,739760,741920,it's not it's probably what i'm gonna

Ay4qA5emBFw,744000,746399,something
Ay4qA5emBFw,749279,752320,coming in today to try to sell my 1915
Ay4qA5emBFw,752320,754800,comptometer back in the 1930s my
Ay4qA5emBFw,754800,756880,grandmother was a payroll accountant one
Ay4qA5emBFw,756880,758160,of the reasons i want to sell this
Ay4qA5emBFw,758160,759839,comptometer today is because i have a
Ay4qA5emBFw,759839,761680,calculator and it works a whole lot
Ay4qA5emBFw,761680,763279,better and does a lot more and it's a
Ay4qA5emBFw,763279,764959,lot smaller and lightweight have you
Ay4qA5emBFw,764959,766240,messed around with it does it work yeah
Ay4qA5emBFw,766240,767680,i've played with it my daughter's played
Ay4qA5emBFw,767680,769200,with it it works
Ay4qA5emBFw,769200,771120,and this is the actual manual yeah this
Ay4qA5emBFw,771120,772959,is the actual manual it was in the box
Ay4qA5emBFw,772959,774800,with this it's got my grandmother's name
Ay4qA5emBFw,774800,777040,in it so
Ay4qA5emBFw,777040,778320,i can't believe you have the manual with
Ay4qA5emBFw,778320,781200,it i mean that is pretty cool i mean
Ay4qA5emBFw,781200,783200,i know that burrows started actually
Ay4qA5emBFw,783200,785680,making calculators right around the late
Ay4qA5emBFw,785680,787680,1800s after every entry you'd have to
Ay4qA5emBFw,787680,791760,crank it real similar to a cash register
Ay4qA5emBFw,792079,793920,this is just cool
Ay4qA5emBFw,793920,796560,back in the day that was high tech
Ay4qA5emBFw,796560,799279,i went in the navy in the late 50s and
Ay4qA5emBFw,799279,801839,believe it or not we use the manual
Ay4qA5emBFw,801839,804160,to do our payroll and stuff
Ay4qA5emBFw,804160,805440,so what do you want to do with it sell
Ay4qA5emBFw,805440,808720,it um how much did you want for it
Ay4qA5emBFw,808720,810639,250.
Ay4qA5emBFw,810639,813040,there's no way we go 250. i would give
Ay4qA5emBFw,813040,814560,you like 75 bucks for it because i think
Ay4qA5emBFw,814560,816639,i could probably get 150 with the manual
Ay4qA5emBFw,816639,819360,no more no more 75 would be it i mean if
Ay4qA5emBFw,819360,821040,it was worth more i'd pay more it's just
Ay4qA5emBFw,821040,824240,not 75 is good okay well deal let's do
Ay4qA5emBFw,824240,825279,some paperwork
Ay4qA5emBFw,825279,826639,you don't have to spend a lot on every
Ay4qA5emBFw,826639,828800,item it's all about profit margin i
Ay4qA5emBFw,828800,830800,stand to make like 50 on this neil and
Ay4qA5emBFw,830800,832880,that puts me in there for the 500 payout
Ay4qA5emBFw,832880,834399,at the end of the month hey how's it
Ay4qA5emBFw,834399,835839,going hey how you doing
Ay4qA5emBFw,835839,837199,what do we got here
Ay4qA5emBFw,837199,840800,uh it's a view master 3d projector okay
Ay4qA5emBFw,840800,844959,i'm you know open it up for me yeah sure
Ay4qA5emBFw,844959,846880,okay so
Ay4qA5emBFw,846880,848160,i know these things became really
Ay4qA5emBFw,848160,850480,popular in the 1930s yeah what it was
Ay4qA5emBFw,850480,852079,there was this little round disc you put
Ay4qA5emBFw,852079,853440,inside there and then you would click
Ay4qA5emBFw,853440,854720,that down and it would just turn the
Ay4qA5emBFw,854720,856240,disc and it would give you like a 3d
Ay4qA5emBFw,856240,857440,version of it on the wall you know
Ay4qA5emBFw,857440,859440,people didn't travel like they do now
Ay4qA5emBFw,859440,861519,you know my oh my how we forget you know
Ay4qA5emBFw,861519,865040,living in the 21st century
Ay4qA5emBFw,865040,866480,i'm here at the pawn shop today to sell
Ay4qA5emBFw,866480,868720,my view master 3d projector i got the
Ay4qA5emBFw,868720,870720,projector from my grandparents attic the
Ay4qA5emBFw,870720,873040,overall condition is in pretty good
Ay4qA5emBFw,873040,875360,condition for how old it is it's just
Ay4qA5emBFw,875360,877519,been sitting in a closet and i'm just
Ay4qA5emBFw,877519,879839,looking to get rid of it i'm hoping to
Ay4qA5emBFw,879839,882240,sell it for 200.
Ay4qA5emBFw,882240,883680,this is interesting
Ay4qA5emBFw,883680,885360,it was almost like a little mini
Ay4qA5emBFw,885360,886959,vacation you got to see sites from
Ay4qA5emBFw,886959,889040,around the world and it's like a 3d view
Ay4qA5emBFw,889040,891120,that's what these things were used for
Ay4qA5emBFw,891120,893760,but typically it was used in schools a
Ay4qA5emBFw,893760,895600,lot to see like this is what the eiffel
Ay4qA5emBFw,895600,896959,tower looks like if you're standing in
Ay4qA5emBFw,896959,899199,front of it okay taj mahal whatever you
Ay4qA5emBFw,899199,901440,wanted it was all on these little discs
Ay4qA5emBFw,901440,902800,it was almost kind of like you were
Ay4qA5emBFw,902800,904399,there the military used them for
Ay4qA5emBFw,904399,906160,training for kind of going through
Ay4qA5emBFw,906160,908160,battle plans so you know you can see how
Ay4qA5emBFw,908160,909600,important it was to you know to be able
Ay4qA5emBFw,909600,911279,to blast a big giant picture of a
Ay4qA5emBFw,911279,913600,battlefield in the 40s rather than just
Ay4qA5emBFw,913600,914959,sitting there with a giant like
Ay4qA5emBFw,914959,917199,geographical map you could just project
Ay4qA5emBFw,917199,919519,it on the wall and it kind of gave an
Ay4qA5emBFw,919519,921760,entire room of an idea of what they were
Ay4qA5emBFw,921760,923120,going into
Ay4qA5emBFw,923120,924880,they served a purpose for a while but as
Ay4qA5emBFw,924880,926800,soon as modern video came out this thing
Ay4qA5emBFw,926800,928560,just kind of went away of the dinosaur
Ay4qA5emBFw,928560,930800,okay so do you have any of the discs
Ay4qA5emBFw,930800,932959,with it or anything no uh this is the
Ay4qA5emBFw,932959,934560,only thing that they had up there with
Ay4qA5emBFw,934560,936160,it do you got the power cord or anything
Ay4qA5emBFw,936160,937440,with it no
Ay4qA5emBFw,937440,940639,what are you looking to do with it um so
Ay4qA5emBFw,940639,942000,any idea in what you're looking to get
Ay4qA5emBFw,942000,943920,out of it 200.
Ay4qA5emBFw,943920,945920,okay um
Ay4qA5emBFw,945920,948320,if you had the maybe some discs and the
Ay4qA5emBFw,948320,950480,power cable and stuff like that with it
Ay4qA5emBFw,950480,952720,i could maybe see going somewhere near
Ay4qA5emBFw,952720,954800,there but as it sits i'd offer you 50
Ay4qA5emBFw,954800,956160,bucks
Ay4qA5emBFw,956160,958560,how about 100.
Ay4qA5emBFw,958560,959680,i'll tell you what i'll give you 80
Ay4qA5emBFw,959680,960959,bucks and i'll take the boat anchor off
Ay4qA5emBFw,960959,963360,your hands
Ay4qA5emBFw,964800,968240,all right deal yep meet you over there
Ay4qA5emBFw,968240,970399,i sold it for 80 and i'm good with that
Ay4qA5emBFw,970399,972320,i mean i was missing parts and that
Ay4qA5emBFw,972320,973920,weren't there and they took it off my
Ay4qA5emBFw,973920,977839,hands what is that this is a reynolds
Ay4qA5emBFw,977839,979600,1910
Ay4qA5emBFw,979600,981440,envelope sealer
Ay4qA5emBFw,981440,982720,okay
Ay4qA5emBFw,982720,984079,can you imagine if you worked for the
Ay4qA5emBFw,984079,986639,power company licking closed few
Ay4qA5emBFw,986639,989279,thousand power bills a day you were home
Ay4qA5emBFw,989279,991519,by
Ay4qA5emBFw,994399,997360,i acquired it at an estate sale
Ay4qA5emBFw,997360,999680,i'd like to sell it because it's taking
Ay4qA5emBFw,999680,1002240,up space in my house i'd like to get
Ay4qA5emBFw,1002240,1004639,about 400
Ay4qA5emBFw,1004639,1008160,i would probably spend the money on a
Ay4qA5emBFw,1008160,1009920,birthday present for my husband his
Ay4qA5emBFw,1009920,1012399,birthday's next week
Ay4qA5emBFw,1012399,1014800,this is really neat this is something
Ay4qA5emBFw,1014800,1016720,that definitely made a company's
Ay4qA5emBFw,1016720,1018720,business easier
Ay4qA5emBFw,1018720,1020079,when this thing was in proper working
Ay4qA5emBFw,1020079,1022399,order and you had a great operator who
Ay4qA5emBFw,1022399,1025360,was doing 50 to 100 envelopes a minute
Ay4qA5emBFw,1025360,1027038,i love it i mean there's things that
Ay4qA5emBFw,1027038,1028640,they did back then they don't do today i
Ay4qA5emBFw,1028640,1031280,mean you don't see gold leafing on
Ay4qA5emBFw,1031280,1033199,office equipment anymore and this right
Ay4qA5emBFw,1033199,1034240,here they could have made this for a
Ay4qA5emBFw,1034240,1035760,little less money but it wouldn't have
Ay4qA5emBFw,1035760,1036798,looked good
Ay4qA5emBFw,1036798,1038720,in this time period aesthetics were very
Ay4qA5emBFw,1038720,1040880,very important
Ay4qA5emBFw,1040880,1044240,in the early 1900s this envelope sealer
Ay4qA5emBFw,1044240,1046400,was actually pretty high tech it
Ay4qA5emBFw,1046400,1048640,eventually evolved into an automatic
Ay4qA5emBFw,1048640,1049679,version
Ay4qA5emBFw,1049679,1052400,and today those machines can do 15 000
Ay4qA5emBFw,1052400,1054559,envelopes an hour
Ay4qA5emBFw,1054559,1057039,so how did this thing exactly work
Ay4qA5emBFw,1057039,1058880,the sticky part of the envelope would be
Ay4qA5emBFw,1058880,1061520,here fed through this way through there
Ay4qA5emBFw,1061520,1063760,yeah
Ay4qA5emBFw,1063840,1066400,come out and then from what i figured
Ay4qA5emBFw,1066400,1069200,out was that you had to close it push it
Ay4qA5emBFw,1069200,1071600,through these other series of rollers
Ay4qA5emBFw,1071600,1074880,okay there we go
Ay4qA5emBFw,1075200,1075800,cool
Ay4qA5emBFw,1075800,1076670,[Music]
Ay4qA5emBFw,1076670,1078640,[Applause]
