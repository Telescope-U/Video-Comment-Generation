C-qhYGIZeHA,0,2000,i think we all just need to calm down
C-qhYGIZeHA,2000,4319,and realize that skinny jeans are not
C-qhYGIZeHA,4319,7600,the enemy alexis sunshine 83 it's always
C-qhYGIZeHA,7600,9200,sunny here
C-qhYGIZeHA,9200,11920,hey there so i make a lot of trend
C-qhYGIZeHA,11920,14320,related videos like thrifting fashion
C-qhYGIZeHA,14320,17520,trends styling fashion trends giving my
C-qhYGIZeHA,17520,21119,opinion on fashion trends and usually in
C-qhYGIZeHA,21119,24240,those videos i focus on you know hot and
C-qhYGIZeHA,24240,28080,trendy trends but instead today i wanted
C-qhYGIZeHA,28080,30560,to talk about specifically outdated
C-qhYGIZeHA,30560,32160,fashion trends or at least what you
C-qhYGIZeHA,32160,35200,think is considered outdated because i
C-qhYGIZeHA,35200,37360,had asked on my instagram which is alex
C-qhYGIZeHA,37360,39760,sunshine83 for you to submit trends that
C-qhYGIZeHA,39760,42480,you think are outdated or out of style
C-qhYGIZeHA,42480,45520,and i chose 10 different ones to style
C-qhYGIZeHA,45520,48239,and kind of give a new life because i
C-qhYGIZeHA,48239,51440,would say most of these are from 2010 to
C-qhYGIZeHA,51440,54559,2015. obviously wearing something that
C-qhYGIZeHA,54559,57840,is outdated isn't bad i'm sure there's
C-qhYGIZeHA,57840,59920,gonna be plenty of people in my comments
C-qhYGIZeHA,59920,61920,saying like i still wear that and
C-qhYGIZeHA,61920,64158,literally that's how it should be wear
C-qhYGIZeHA,64158,66640,whatever makes you happy and fashion
C-qhYGIZeHA,66640,68720,trends always come back there are a
C-qhYGIZeHA,68720,71040,couple in this video that i can already
C-qhYGIZeHA,71040,73360,see becoming trendy again in the next
C-qhYGIZeHA,73360,74880,one to two years
C-qhYGIZeHA,74880,77200,so what the first fashion trend we are
C-qhYGIZeHA,77200,79520,going to be starting with is the skater
C-qhYGIZeHA,79520,82240,skirt with absolute icons during this
C-qhYGIZeHA,82240,85600,time at being bethany moda ariana grande
C-qhYGIZeHA,85600,88560,the skater skirt came in multiple colors
C-qhYGIZeHA,88560,90880,and patterns but had an emphasis on
C-qhYGIZeHA,90880,93200,giving a flowing effect that mimicked
C-qhYGIZeHA,93200,95840,the skirts of figure skaters i honestly
C-qhYGIZeHA,95840,98240,think skater skirts are still pretty
C-qhYGIZeHA,98240,100159,cute but i feel like the way that they
C-qhYGIZeHA,100159,103200,were styled back then is what made them
C-qhYGIZeHA,103200,106079,outdated although the pleated tennis
C-qhYGIZeHA,106079,108720,skirt had a resurgence two years ago and
C-qhYGIZeHA,108720,111439,the style of the pleated tennis skirt is
C-qhYGIZeHA,111439,114720,basically the same as the skater skirt
C-qhYGIZeHA,114720,117280,just in the silhouette so i actually see
C-qhYGIZeHA,117280,119920,skater skirts coming back pretty soon
C-qhYGIZeHA,119920,122399,this floral skater skirt i decided to
C-qhYGIZeHA,122399,125280,pair with a loose fitting crop top and a
C-qhYGIZeHA,125280,128879,vest yes i'm covering the swooshiness of
C-qhYGIZeHA,128879,131920,the skirt but this is how i would style
C-qhYGIZeHA,131920,134239,any short skirt like this and for me it
C-qhYGIZeHA,134239,136400,makes it way more wearable back during
C-qhYGIZeHA,136400,139360,the 2010s the skater skirt really had a
C-qhYGIZeHA,139360,142959,cutesy look to it at least in my opinion
C-qhYGIZeHA,142959,145440,yes you could add combat boots and a
C-qhYGIZeHA,145440,147680,spiked military jacket but a lot of the
C-qhYGIZeHA,147680,151120,silhouettes still gave yum which isn't
C-qhYGIZeHA,151120,152959,bad either like teens were wearing it so
C-qhYGIZeHA,152959,155120,obviously they looked young but making
C-qhYGIZeHA,155120,158160,it look more casual like i just threw
C-qhYGIZeHA,158160,160319,this on takes away from that put
C-qhYGIZeHA,160319,163440,together look it always was styled as
C-qhYGIZeHA,163440,166239,then topping it with this type of chunky
C-qhYGIZeHA,166239,168959,platform boot aligns it even more with
C-qhYGIZeHA,168959,171680,my style now which i'd recommend if you
C-qhYGIZeHA,171680,173680,have a skater skirt or any of these
C-qhYGIZeHA,173680,175760,outdated trends and you don't know how
C-qhYGIZeHA,175760,178319,to style them to be more modern take
C-qhYGIZeHA,178319,180879,core pieces of your current style and
C-qhYGIZeHA,180879,182879,just pair them with the piece i know
C-qhYGIZeHA,182879,184560,that's pretty obvious but when you have
C-qhYGIZeHA,184560,186400,a piece like this that maybe you got
C-qhYGIZeHA,186400,189840,during the 2010s you really forget how
C-qhYGIZeHA,189840,192239,to style it for your current style
C-qhYGIZeHA,192239,193599,because all you're thinking about is how
C-qhYGIZeHA,193599,195840,you used to wear it and sometimes it can
C-qhYGIZeHA,195840,198560,make you like be stuck with styling it
C-qhYGIZeHA,198560,200560,also i just have to acknowledge i'm
C-qhYGIZeHA,200560,201599,literally
C-qhYGIZeHA,201599,204080,wearing a skater skirt that miss bethany
C-qhYGIZeHA,204080,207360,moda once rocked yeah the next trend is
C-qhYGIZeHA,207360,210159,the faux fur vest and honestly with the
C-qhYGIZeHA,210159,213040,popularity of soup vests and sweater
C-qhYGIZeHA,213040,214879,vests the past couple of years i
C-qhYGIZeHA,214879,217280,definitely see this coming back but the
C-qhYGIZeHA,217280,220000,way that it was styled back when it was
C-qhYGIZeHA,220000,223360,super popular was with like skinny jeans
C-qhYGIZeHA,223360,226959,or leggings booties and maybe a like
C-qhYGIZeHA,226959,229680,black long sleeve top i feel today we
C-qhYGIZeHA,229680,232959,would emphasize the grandness of it like
C-qhYGIZeHA,232959,234720,really committing to the fact that we
C-qhYGIZeHA,234720,237120,are wearing a faux fur vest very old
C-qhYGIZeHA,237120,240159,hollywood very extravagant so i did just
C-qhYGIZeHA,240159,242720,the hat with pairing this one with a
C-qhYGIZeHA,242720,245040,long slip dress and tying back the
C-qhYGIZeHA,245040,247360,colors of the vest with my boots i'm not
C-qhYGIZeHA,247360,250000,trying to dress it down i am truly
C-qhYGIZeHA,250000,253360,executing it as being loud with so many
C-qhYGIZeHA,253360,255599,aesthetics like cottage core and dark
C-qhYGIZeHA,255599,259680,academia we really love to commit to a
C-qhYGIZeHA,259680,262400,theme regardless if it's practical i
C-qhYGIZeHA,262400,264320,don't know if this outfit could be
C-qhYGIZeHA,264320,266720,considered in any aesthetic but i
C-qhYGIZeHA,266720,269440,honestly kind of love it so my advice
C-qhYGIZeHA,269440,271199,for something like this is to put it
C-qhYGIZeHA,271199,274160,with contrasting materials like silk or
C-qhYGIZeHA,274160,276639,even lace i think it really pairs so
C-qhYGIZeHA,276639,279280,well with slip dresses or any type of
C-qhYGIZeHA,279280,281840,pajama wear i had gotten the cold
C-qhYGIZeHA,281840,285120,shoulder slash off the shoulder top a
C-qhYGIZeHA,285120,287759,bunch so i knew i had to do it
C-qhYGIZeHA,287759,290320,especially because cold shoulder tops
C-qhYGIZeHA,290320,292960,like were everything to me maybe it was
C-qhYGIZeHA,292960,294800,years of schooling telling me that
C-qhYGIZeHA,294800,297759,shoulders were scandalous but those cold
C-qhYGIZeHA,297759,300080,shoulder tops really gave us the power
C-qhYGIZeHA,300080,302240,to show our shoulders without getting
C-qhYGIZeHA,302240,304240,dressed coated so i thrifted this i
C-qhYGIZeHA,304240,306960,guess cold shoulder top like the style
C-qhYGIZeHA,306960,309440,is a little different than most that i
C-qhYGIZeHA,309440,311680,was talking about but i think it would
C-qhYGIZeHA,311680,314400,still be considered outdated which i was
C-qhYGIZeHA,314400,316800,shocked how much i actually loved this
C-qhYGIZeHA,316800,318400,top especially with the straps being
C-qhYGIZeHA,318400,320960,little bows i paired it with this denim
C-qhYGIZeHA,320960,323680,maxi skirt cal print belt and to tie in
C-qhYGIZeHA,323680,326800,the bows on the top i added these white
C-qhYGIZeHA,326800,329120,heels with bows i honestly really like
C-qhYGIZeHA,329120,331600,this outfit it's simple yet the small
C-qhYGIZeHA,331600,333759,details of everything just pulls it
C-qhYGIZeHA,333759,336320,together obviously i chose a white top
C-qhYGIZeHA,336320,338080,so it does make it easier to style
C-qhYGIZeHA,338080,340479,something i saw in stila spotlight's
C-qhYGIZeHA,340479,342080,video where she styled and off the
C-qhYGIZeHA,342080,345600,shoulder top is adding a vest and like
C-qhYGIZeHA,345600,348880,that is such a cute concept so i did get
C-qhYGIZeHA,348880,351520,inspiration and created this outfit with
C-qhYGIZeHA,351520,353680,my denim vest and usually i would just
C-qhYGIZeHA,353680,356000,add a white t-shirt under it but the
C-qhYGIZeHA,356000,358479,little off the shoulder bit is so cute
C-qhYGIZeHA,358479,360240,with this outfit and could be a great
C-qhYGIZeHA,360240,362880,idea for any off the shoulder top now i
C-qhYGIZeHA,362880,364000,have to say
C-qhYGIZeHA,364000,367199,chevron was the hardest one for me to
C-qhYGIZeHA,367199,369039,style i'm just gonna be honest so i
C-qhYGIZeHA,369039,371600,ended up putting together a couple of
C-qhYGIZeHA,371600,373520,different outfits i don't know why
C-qhYGIZeHA,373520,376240,chevron was so popular but it was on
C-qhYGIZeHA,376240,378240,everything like literally in every
C-qhYGIZeHA,378240,380400,single color on clothing
C-qhYGIZeHA,380400,383840,on shoes on home decor like it was
C-qhYGIZeHA,383840,386960,everywhere and i don't think it's a bad
C-qhYGIZeHA,386960,389440,pattern i wouldn't say it's personally
C-qhYGIZeHA,389440,392240,my favorite pattern i had thrifted this
C-qhYGIZeHA,392240,394400,chevron dress that was so
C-qhYGIZeHA,394400,397199,difficult to style i think maybe because
C-qhYGIZeHA,397199,400800,chevron is so bold possibly but i first
C-qhYGIZeHA,400800,403039,tried to put this yellow sweater on top
C-qhYGIZeHA,403039,405199,of it because i thought of black and
C-qhYGIZeHA,405199,407600,white with yellow could be fun and i
C-qhYGIZeHA,407600,409840,think it's fine with the chevron pokey
C-qhYGIZeHA,409840,411440,now at the bottom but it wouldn't be
C-qhYGIZeHA,411440,414160,something i'd necessarily wear so i then
C-qhYGIZeHA,414160,416400,thought of let me style it with a
C-qhYGIZeHA,416400,419280,clashing pattern like checkered so i
C-qhYGIZeHA,419280,421919,layered this checkered blazer on top
C-qhYGIZeHA,421919,424160,maybe it's because it was like an
C-qhYGIZeHA,424160,427039,off-white and black chevron versus white
C-qhYGIZeHA,427039,430000,and black chevron that was throwing it
C-qhYGIZeHA,430000,432479,all off but i then just decided to go
C-qhYGIZeHA,432479,435440,simple and make the dress a skirt
C-qhYGIZeHA,435440,438080,instead i had to use a belt to tuck in
C-qhYGIZeHA,438080,440800,the dress and this black t-shirt to give
C-qhYGIZeHA,440800,443759,the illusion of a skirt and crop team
C-qhYGIZeHA,443759,446639,does it work maybe maybe not but this is
C-qhYGIZeHA,446639,449520,something that would be a realistic way
C-qhYGIZeHA,449520,452400,of me wearing chevron and maybe it
C-qhYGIZeHA,452400,454479,looking like a skirt is something more
C-qhYGIZeHA,454479,457039,wearable than just a chevron dress
C-qhYGIZeHA,457039,459360,possibly because it being a
C-qhYGIZeHA,459360,462319,dress it's almost like too bold so i
C-qhYGIZeHA,462319,465120,would say if you own any chevron
C-qhYGIZeHA,465120,467199,patterned piece that you just don't know
C-qhYGIZeHA,467199,469680,how to style take whatever the main
C-qhYGIZeHA,469680,472080,color is in the chevron pattern and try
C-qhYGIZeHA,472080,474400,to style it with those pieces i think it
C-qhYGIZeHA,474400,477360,takes away like how in your face the
C-qhYGIZeHA,477360,479919,pattern is especially because i then
C-qhYGIZeHA,479919,482000,added this leather blazer that is
C-qhYGIZeHA,482000,485120,actually the same off-white as what's in
C-qhYGIZeHA,485120,488240,the skirt or like slash dress and it
C-qhYGIZeHA,488240,490319,made it way more wearable to me
C-qhYGIZeHA,490319,493599,something i've actually seen on current
C-qhYGIZeHA,493599,497039,trends list is the hilo dress
C-qhYGIZeHA,497039,500319,skirts so even though it's outdated it's
C-qhYGIZeHA,500319,502240,also coming back at least that's what
C-qhYGIZeHA,502240,504560,the fashion people are saying it isn't
C-qhYGIZeHA,504560,506800,something i've necessarily written off
C-qhYGIZeHA,506800,508160,especially because
C-qhYGIZeHA,508160,512320,maybe it's just me but hilo pieces do
C-qhYGIZeHA,512320,515839,have a cool purpose of creating shape to
C-qhYGIZeHA,515839,518479,your body especially compared to say
C-qhYGIZeHA,518479,520959,like a lawn maxi dress which i think for
C-qhYGIZeHA,520959,522800,this you can kind of go a couple
C-qhYGIZeHA,522800,524640,different ways depending on your
C-qhYGIZeHA,524640,527680,comfortability but i had thrifted this
C-qhYGIZeHA,527680,529920,faux leather top hi-lo dress and i
C-qhYGIZeHA,529920,533200,decided to focus on layering so i paired
C-qhYGIZeHA,533200,535600,a white t-shirt under it and added a pop
C-qhYGIZeHA,535600,537920,of color with my red boots i think i do
C-qhYGIZeHA,537920,540480,like the idea that with this hi-lo dress
C-qhYGIZeHA,540480,543360,you are seeing more of my red boots
C-qhYGIZeHA,543360,546160,versus if it was just all one length and
C-qhYGIZeHA,546160,548399,then adding my black leather blazer i
C-qhYGIZeHA,548399,549920,just think it's a cool look it's not
C-qhYGIZeHA,549920,552640,something i would wear every day but the
C-qhYGIZeHA,552640,554560,silhouette is interesting i did try to
C-qhYGIZeHA,554560,556959,put a t-shirt over this dress and it
C-qhYGIZeHA,556959,559279,just did not work with any of these
C-qhYGIZeHA,559279,561839,trends layering is kind of your best
C-qhYGIZeHA,561839,564800,friend i feel like this particular trend
C-qhYGIZeHA,564800,567120,was always styled just by itself like
C-qhYGIZeHA,567120,568640,there was nothing added to it maybe like
C-qhYGIZeHA,568640,570800,a chunky statement necklace but other
C-qhYGIZeHA,570800,573040,than that it was just like the dress so
C-qhYGIZeHA,573040,575600,i recommend adding layering to it to
C-qhYGIZeHA,575600,578080,make it more wearable for 2022 and i
C-qhYGIZeHA,578080,580160,feel like you can really go like
C-qhYGIZeHA,580160,582880,maximalist layering different colors and
C-qhYGIZeHA,582880,584320,textures with it i mean you could put
C-qhYGIZeHA,584320,586480,fun tights with it and it would like
C-qhYGIZeHA,586480,588880,show because it's high low and all that
C-qhYGIZeHA,588880,592240,so i had to do skinny jeans especially
C-qhYGIZeHA,592240,595600,for how roasted they were a year ago and
C-qhYGIZeHA,595600,597680,i think we all just need to calm down
C-qhYGIZeHA,597680,600000,and realize that skinny jeans are not
C-qhYGIZeHA,600000,602640,the enemy the actual enemy is jean
C-qhYGIZeHA,602640,605360,styles going in and out of style like
C-qhYGIZeHA,605360,607040,jeans are so
C-qhYGIZeHA,607040,610640,specific to you in your body and just
C-qhYGIZeHA,610640,613120,your preference overall even though they
C-qhYGIZeHA,613120,615760,aren't my preferred style of jean i
C-qhYGIZeHA,615760,618079,still understand them and i think they
C-qhYGIZeHA,618079,620320,do have a place with saying all that i
C-qhYGIZeHA,620320,623279,did try to specifically thrift the
C-qhYGIZeHA,623279,626399,topshop joanie jeans because those were
C-qhYGIZeHA,626399,629120,like the skinny jeans like it looked
C-qhYGIZeHA,629120,631120,like basically they had been painted
C-qhYGIZeHA,631120,633120,onto your body because they were so
C-qhYGIZeHA,633120,636079,tight and i wore them for years but alas
C-qhYGIZeHA,636079,638800,the ones that i did thrift on thredup i
C-qhYGIZeHA,638800,640160,thought they were the joni jeans but
C-qhYGIZeHA,640160,642640,they were in fact the jamie jeans which
C-qhYGIZeHA,642640,644320,are i mean they're still skinny jeans
C-qhYGIZeHA,644320,646800,but like they aren't the joanie jeans
C-qhYGIZeHA,646800,648720,but we we will just deal with what we
C-qhYGIZeHA,648720,651600,have so i paired this suit vest and
C-qhYGIZeHA,651600,653680,little heels because skinny jeans i
C-qhYGIZeHA,653680,655839,think can create a very put together
C-qhYGIZeHA,655839,658959,look again love my loose fitting jeans
C-qhYGIZeHA,658959,661760,but i actually didn't hate the skinny
C-qhYGIZeHA,661760,663600,jeans i definitely wouldn't wear
C-qhYGIZeHA,663600,666640,anything that i would need to tuck in to
C-qhYGIZeHA,666640,668320,the skinny jeans because with them being
C-qhYGIZeHA,668320,670640,so tight and then having to add a bunch
C-qhYGIZeHA,670640,672959,of fabric into the jeans like it would
C-qhYGIZeHA,672959,674880,just be super uncomfortable so i
C-qhYGIZeHA,674880,677680,definitely focus on crop tops or like
C-qhYGIZeHA,677680,679680,button ups where i didn't tuck them in i
C-qhYGIZeHA,679680,682079,just see skinny jeans being styled with
C-qhYGIZeHA,682079,684880,more basics personally these ones were a
C-qhYGIZeHA,684880,687040,little short i will say so there is a
C-qhYGIZeHA,687040,689760,little leg skin action but for the
C-qhYGIZeHA,689760,691839,styling i think it did work i was kind
C-qhYGIZeHA,691839,694160,of shocked how many people said two tops
C-qhYGIZeHA,694160,695839,are outdated especially because in
C-qhYGIZeHA,695839,697760,wednesday's video i talked about how two
C-qhYGIZeHA,697760,701279,tops are like trendy again tube tops i
C-qhYGIZeHA,701279,704560,think were really big in the early 2000s
C-qhYGIZeHA,704560,706160,i'm pretty sure i just feel like i
C-qhYGIZeHA,706160,708000,remember seeing them the most during
C-qhYGIZeHA,708000,711040,that time but maybe they did come back
C-qhYGIZeHA,711040,714079,during the 2010s but anyway i think tube
C-qhYGIZeHA,714079,716480,top should be a classic like the tank
C-qhYGIZeHA,716480,719120,top it's literally the perfect piece for
C-qhYGIZeHA,719120,720800,summertime as long as you have one that
C-qhYGIZeHA,720800,722160,like stays up and you don't have to
C-qhYGIZeHA,722160,724399,constantly like pull it up i paired this
C-qhYGIZeHA,724399,727120,black tube top with just a long skirt
C-qhYGIZeHA,727120,729760,and black boots but i truly think you
C-qhYGIZeHA,729760,733440,can style a tube top with anything jeans
C-qhYGIZeHA,733440,736560,trousers shorts like truly anything
C-qhYGIZeHA,736560,739360,especially if it's in a solid color it
C-qhYGIZeHA,739360,741839,does give that same like i'm gonna rock
C-qhYGIZeHA,741839,744639,my bare shoulders vibe that the off the
C-qhYGIZeHA,744639,747680,shoulder top did but i think it's more
C-qhYGIZeHA,747680,750720,simple than that okay the next outdated
C-qhYGIZeHA,750720,753760,trend is the kimono and i think i'm just
C-qhYGIZeHA,753760,756399,gonna call it a sheer cardigan because
C-qhYGIZeHA,756399,759120,that's basically what it is so yeah
C-qhYGIZeHA,759120,763279,these were everything to me back in 2013
C-qhYGIZeHA,763279,765680,i think it's because with my armpits
C-qhYGIZeHA,765680,767440,sweating so much like my armpits are
C-qhYGIZeHA,767440,769519,literally just always sweaty it was a
C-qhYGIZeHA,769519,771680,great way to conceal it it would like
C-qhYGIZeHA,771680,774320,cover the sweat stains on my top without
C-qhYGIZeHA,774320,776240,overheating it was like the one way i
C-qhYGIZeHA,776240,778560,did lay her back then i decided to put
C-qhYGIZeHA,778560,781600,this floral one with some trousers and a
C-qhYGIZeHA,781600,784240,floral pink tank top i actually love the
C-qhYGIZeHA,784240,786160,idea of the two florals together
C-qhYGIZeHA,786160,788240,especially because i used to only style
C-qhYGIZeHA,788240,791040,it with solid colors or really random
C-qhYGIZeHA,791040,793360,patterns like a chevron top with
C-qhYGIZeHA,793360,795600,something like this but styling these
C-qhYGIZeHA,795600,797839,two florals together just makes sense to
C-qhYGIZeHA,797839,800880,me i think these are still perfect for
C-qhYGIZeHA,800880,803440,like the beach and i did try to tie it
C-qhYGIZeHA,803440,806160,and tuck it in almost to mimic a
C-qhYGIZeHA,806160,808880,button-up top and it kind of
C-qhYGIZeHA,808880,811839,works and kind of also doesn't truly it
C-qhYGIZeHA,811839,814720,basically is the same as me styling a
C-qhYGIZeHA,814720,817600,normal button up top just unbuttoned so
C-qhYGIZeHA,817600,819600,i would say don't overthink styling
C-qhYGIZeHA,819600,822160,these and it does make a nice layering
C-qhYGIZeHA,822160,824160,piece for summer i don't know what this
C-qhYGIZeHA,824160,827120,next one is called like a strappy tank
C-qhYGIZeHA,827120,828480,top or
C-qhYGIZeHA,828480,830320,random caged
C-qhYGIZeHA,830320,833120,chest top but basically these this is
C-qhYGIZeHA,833120,836320,another one i wore a bunch and you know
C-qhYGIZeHA,836320,839120,i get it this is one that i think can
C-qhYGIZeHA,839120,841040,still hold up today like style
C-qhYGIZeHA,841040,844399,differently obviously but with harnesses
C-qhYGIZeHA,844399,847360,being styled casually and subversive
C-qhYGIZeHA,847360,850639,basics like i think this type of style
C-qhYGIZeHA,850639,852399,can still be worn
C-qhYGIZeHA,852399,855279,now i personally first try to style it
C-qhYGIZeHA,855279,858720,on top of this harley davidson tee which
C-qhYGIZeHA,858720,860480,you know what i don't know if i actually
C-qhYGIZeHA,860480,862880,liked it i was just thinking of styling
C-qhYGIZeHA,862880,865839,it with something that wouldn't cover up
C-qhYGIZeHA,865839,868800,the detail of the top and instead
C-qhYGIZeHA,868800,870399,emphasize it and
C-qhYGIZeHA,870399,871519,yeah
C-qhYGIZeHA,871519,873760,it's a look i then actually layered it
C-qhYGIZeHA,873760,876480,on top of a sheer long sleeve and i
C-qhYGIZeHA,876480,878560,actually think it looks great i
C-qhYGIZeHA,878560,880480,definitely see it being styled with all
C-qhYGIZeHA,880480,883040,plaque or just more darker tones and
C-qhYGIZeHA,883040,885760,leaning more in that direction and at
C-qhYGIZeHA,885760,888720,the time that it was big i didn't wear a
C-qhYGIZeHA,888720,891519,lot of jewelry so i think it also helped
C-qhYGIZeHA,891519,893920,in creating more interesting outfits
C-qhYGIZeHA,893920,896560,than just a black tank top okay i talked
C-qhYGIZeHA,896560,899920,about a couple that i wore a lot but the
C-qhYGIZeHA,899920,903360,peplum top was like me i feel like i
C-qhYGIZeHA,903360,906480,owned a peplum top in every single color
C-qhYGIZeHA,906480,908160,every single pattern like it just did
C-qhYGIZeHA,908160,910000,something for my confidence because i
C-qhYGIZeHA,910000,912160,was super insecure about like my stomach
C-qhYGIZeHA,912160,914320,which is just super silly but it just
C-qhYGIZeHA,914320,917360,helped me be able to wear clothes that
C-qhYGIZeHA,917360,919519,didn't maybe emphasize a part of my body
C-qhYGIZeHA,919519,921920,that i wasn't super confident with at
C-qhYGIZeHA,921920,924480,that time and i still think peplums are
C-qhYGIZeHA,924480,926560,cute obviously some of the styles of
C-qhYGIZeHA,926560,929199,peplum tops that were really big weren't
C-qhYGIZeHA,929199,931839,like my personal preference but i think
C-qhYGIZeHA,931839,933120,they still
C-qhYGIZeHA,933120,935920,can work nowadays i thrifted this floral
C-qhYGIZeHA,935920,939279,one which is just so of its time like i
C-qhYGIZeHA,939279,942480,can imagine going into forever 21 in the
C-qhYGIZeHA,942480,945279,2010s and seeing this on a mannequin i
C-qhYGIZeHA,945279,947279,layered it on top of a puff sleeve
C-qhYGIZeHA,947279,950160,blouse and patterned skirt i really like
C-qhYGIZeHA,950160,952000,the contrasting prints i don't think i
C-qhYGIZeHA,952000,953920,would have ever thought to layer it with
C-qhYGIZeHA,953920,955600,like a puff sleeve i mean puff sleeve
C-qhYGIZeHA,955600,957519,blouses weren't really that big back
C-qhYGIZeHA,957519,959759,then when peplum tops were but i just
C-qhYGIZeHA,959759,961279,would have never even like thought about
C-qhYGIZeHA,961279,963680,layering peplum tops in general so i
C-qhYGIZeHA,963680,965759,definitely recommend doing if you have a
C-qhYGIZeHA,965759,968000,peplum top and have some sort of like
C-qhYGIZeHA,968000,969600,puff sleeve blouse like pair them
C-qhYGIZeHA,969600,972320,together alrighty i hope i helped any of
