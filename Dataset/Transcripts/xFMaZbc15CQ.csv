xFMaZbc15CQ,560,3040,tonight we're driving the 2021 honda
xFMaZbc15CQ,3040,3840,accord
xFMaZbc15CQ,3840,6560,sport this is the 2-liter turbo that
xFMaZbc15CQ,6560,8559,makes 252 horsepower
xFMaZbc15CQ,8559,12000,mated with a 10-speed automatic gone is
xFMaZbc15CQ,12000,14240,the manual transmission for 2021
xFMaZbc15CQ,14240,15839,unfortunately
xFMaZbc15CQ,15839,18880,but this is still a really solid car
xFMaZbc15CQ,18880,20240,it's been a while since we've tested one
xFMaZbc15CQ,20240,21039,of these
xFMaZbc15CQ,21039,23039,so i'm excited to share my experience
xFMaZbc15CQ,23039,24400,with it this week
xFMaZbc15CQ,24400,27119,with you guys and take you guys out and
xFMaZbc15CQ,27119,28640,another drive in an accord
xFMaZbc15CQ,28640,31439,i love every variant and every version
xFMaZbc15CQ,31439,32640,of the honda accord
xFMaZbc15CQ,32640,35440,from the 1.5 liter turbo to the hybrid
xFMaZbc15CQ,35440,35920,to this
xFMaZbc15CQ,35920,39120,2 liter turbo sport you just kind of
xFMaZbc15CQ,39120,41040,can't go wrong with whatever model
xFMaZbc15CQ,41040,44879,or flavor you want in your cord
xFMaZbc15CQ,44879,47920,it's spacious it's comfortable it's
xFMaZbc15CQ,47920,50719,fast it's kind of fun to drive i believe
xFMaZbc15CQ,50719,51520,this new accord
xFMaZbc15CQ,51520,54079,is the industry standard for a good
xFMaZbc15CQ,54079,54879,sporty
xFMaZbc15CQ,54879,57600,sedan and kind of the ultimate daily
xFMaZbc15CQ,57600,58480,driver
xFMaZbc15CQ,58480,60800,in this thirty thousand dollar price
xFMaZbc15CQ,60800,61760,point
xFMaZbc15CQ,61760,66479,this two liter turbo sport is 32 grand
xFMaZbc15CQ,67520,70960,you don't get as many options in here as
xFMaZbc15CQ,70960,73119,you do with the touring
xFMaZbc15CQ,73119,74799,but that's okay i think you pretty much
xFMaZbc15CQ,74799,76080,get everything you need you get apple
xFMaZbc15CQ,76080,76799,carplay
xFMaZbc15CQ,76799,78479,a really nice cabin with excellent
xFMaZbc15CQ,78479,80320,ergonomics everything in here is
xFMaZbc15CQ,80320,82960,really easy to use we have buttons and
xFMaZbc15CQ,82960,85040,dials and knobs for climate control
xFMaZbc15CQ,85040,87439,as you can see in the dark the knobs
xFMaZbc15CQ,87439,89600,glow red when you turn up the heat
xFMaZbc15CQ,89600,91840,or blue when you turn up the air
xFMaZbc15CQ,91840,93840,conditioning which is very neat
xFMaZbc15CQ,93840,96320,heated seats no heated steering wheel in
xFMaZbc15CQ,96320,98240,the sport model
xFMaZbc15CQ,98240,100880,but i think this represents pretty good
xFMaZbc15CQ,100880,101759,value and
xFMaZbc15CQ,101759,103759,chances are what most people are gonna
xFMaZbc15CQ,103759,105600,be getting with their core two liter
xFMaZbc15CQ,105600,107600,turbos
xFMaZbc15CQ,107600,110159,we've got a decent reverse camera let's
xFMaZbc15CQ,110159,111119,take this thing for a drive
xFMaZbc15CQ,111119,115840,see what it's like on the road
xFMaZbc15CQ,118320,119680,this being a night drive it also gives
xFMaZbc15CQ,119680,123200,you guys a chance to see the headlights
xFMaZbc15CQ,123200,125680,this does have auto high beams they seem
xFMaZbc15CQ,125680,126240,to work
xFMaZbc15CQ,126240,130080,pretty well most of the time
xFMaZbc15CQ,130080,132000,i've always said you really have to just
xFMaZbc15CQ,132000,134400,go and drive one of these new accords
xFMaZbc15CQ,134400,136959,to appreciate how nice they are to live
xFMaZbc15CQ,136959,139120,with on a daily basis
xFMaZbc15CQ,139120,141680,it's just such a tight and well-built
xFMaZbc15CQ,141680,142560,car
xFMaZbc15CQ,142560,144720,it feels like something like this will
xFMaZbc15CQ,144720,146400,still feel fresh
xFMaZbc15CQ,146400,148640,and nice to drive with 200 000 miles on
xFMaZbc15CQ,148640,149440,it it just
xFMaZbc15CQ,149440,157840,feels so well done
xFMaZbc15CQ,162959,165360,this 10-speed automatic is flawless i
xFMaZbc15CQ,165360,167280,think there's a little bit of a stigma
xFMaZbc15CQ,167280,170160,with eight nine 10-speed transmissions
xFMaZbc15CQ,170160,170720,and
xFMaZbc15CQ,170720,172400,this 10 speed just gets rid of all of
xFMaZbc15CQ,172400,173920,that it's smooth
xFMaZbc15CQ,173920,176959,it knows exactly the right gear to be in
xFMaZbc15CQ,176959,178720,it works incredibly well with this two
xFMaZbc15CQ,178720,184080,liter turbo
xFMaZbc15CQ,184080,187200,you ride out the torque
xFMaZbc15CQ,189280,191360,shifts are completely seamless
xFMaZbc15CQ,191360,193440,incredibly smooth
xFMaZbc15CQ,193440,195200,it just works in the background and does
xFMaZbc15CQ,195200,196879,a really nice job
xFMaZbc15CQ,196879,201200,delivering a great driving experience
xFMaZbc15CQ,201920,203280,and if you want to throw it into sport
xFMaZbc15CQ,203280,205599,mode
xFMaZbc15CQ,206640,213840,you can
xFMaZbc15CQ,216799,218560,this thing is pretty quick too this is a
xFMaZbc15CQ,218560,220640,fast car
xFMaZbc15CQ,220640,223360,a few weeks ago we had the sonata m-line
xFMaZbc15CQ,223360,226000,and even though that had 290 horsepower
xFMaZbc15CQ,226000,229440,a dual clutch i think this honda accord
xFMaZbc15CQ,229440,232480,holds its own against that car
xFMaZbc15CQ,232480,234400,i will say the 10-speed auto is a lot
xFMaZbc15CQ,234400,235760,smoother
xFMaZbc15CQ,235760,238319,and easier to drive than that dual
xFMaZbc15CQ,238319,241840,clutch transmission
xFMaZbc15CQ,243519,254239,oh yes
xFMaZbc15CQ,254239,256400,i will say the chassis balance and
xFMaZbc15CQ,256400,257840,handling of this accord
xFMaZbc15CQ,257840,261040,is just incredible
xFMaZbc15CQ,261120,263680,it's so flat around corners and so
xFMaZbc15CQ,263680,267680,predictable and easy to drive quickly
xFMaZbc15CQ,267680,269840,automatic cruise control lane keep
xFMaZbc15CQ,269840,271280,assist
xFMaZbc15CQ,271280,274720,they all do a very nice job reducing
xFMaZbc15CQ,274720,276560,fatigue and just giving you
xFMaZbc15CQ,276560,278560,a more pleasant and luxurious driving
xFMaZbc15CQ,278560,280160,experience
xFMaZbc15CQ,280160,283199,the radar cruise works very well and
xFMaZbc15CQ,283199,284880,the lane keep even though it doesn't
xFMaZbc15CQ,284880,286880,last as long as some of the hyundai
xFMaZbc15CQ,286880,288000,products
xFMaZbc15CQ,288000,289680,it still is one of the better systems
xFMaZbc15CQ,289680,297199,out there
xFMaZbc15CQ,297199,299440,despite these low profile tires ride
xFMaZbc15CQ,299440,300400,quality is
xFMaZbc15CQ,300400,302880,excellent
xFMaZbc15CQ,304560,306720,guys i can't express enough how much
xFMaZbc15CQ,306720,309680,honda has nailed it with this new accord
xFMaZbc15CQ,309680,311199,i think it even looks good too people
xFMaZbc15CQ,311199,312560,have been complaining about the looks
xFMaZbc15CQ,312560,313120,but
xFMaZbc15CQ,313120,314479,i don't know have you guys seen previous
xFMaZbc15CQ,314479,316400,generation accords this
xFMaZbc15CQ,316400,318320,is way better looking than anything that
xFMaZbc15CQ,318320,320560,they've come out with in the past
xFMaZbc15CQ,320560,322160,proportionally i feel like this is
xFMaZbc15CQ,322160,324080,actually a good looking
xFMaZbc15CQ,324080,326560,sedan
xFMaZbc15CQ,327680,329520,look at this handling 60 miles an hour
xFMaZbc15CQ,329520,339440,around an entrance ramp
xFMaZbc15CQ,339440,342560,this thing really pulls
xFMaZbc15CQ,342560,346080,it's surprisingly quick
xFMaZbc15CQ,349600,351280,a little bit of wind noise at highway
xFMaZbc15CQ,351280,354320,speeds if i had one complaint
xFMaZbc15CQ,354320,357280,but not terrible pretty in line with any
xFMaZbc15CQ,357280,360720,other vehicle like this in the class
xFMaZbc15CQ,360720,362160,so the biggest complaint that i do have
xFMaZbc15CQ,362160,364800,about this honda accord is right here
xFMaZbc15CQ,364800,367919,and it is this center console cover it
xFMaZbc15CQ,367919,369120,is just
xFMaZbc15CQ,369120,371280,terribly cheap it's been that way for a
xFMaZbc15CQ,371280,373759,couple generations so i hope honda can
xFMaZbc15CQ,373759,375280,figure out the mechanism in there
xFMaZbc15CQ,375280,377919,someday and fix that
xFMaZbc15CQ,377919,379520,literally my only complaint with the new
xFMaZbc15CQ,379520,381199,accord but hey
xFMaZbc15CQ,381199,384000,it is what it is
xFMaZbc15CQ,389199,391199,this two liter turbo is a great way to
xFMaZbc15CQ,391199,392560,go
xFMaZbc15CQ,392560,394240,if you want just a little bit of extra
xFMaZbc15CQ,394240,395840,performance
xFMaZbc15CQ,395840,397840,the fact that they offer this engine
xFMaZbc15CQ,397840,399600,with a 10-speed automatic instead of a
xFMaZbc15CQ,399600,400400,cvt
xFMaZbc15CQ,400400,409840,is great
xFMaZbc15CQ,411680,413520,despite its power it's even a pretty
xFMaZbc15CQ,413520,415680,efficient powertrain
xFMaZbc15CQ,415680,418240,22 miles of the gallon of the city 32 on
xFMaZbc15CQ,418240,423759,the highway
xFMaZbc15CQ,423759,425599,shouldn't have a problem matching or
xFMaZbc15CQ,425599,427039,even beating those numbers on the
xFMaZbc15CQ,427039,429440,highway
xFMaZbc15CQ,432240,435199,yeah my recommendation is if you're
xFMaZbc15CQ,435199,437520,searching for
xFMaZbc15CQ,437520,440080,a midsize sedan just go drive the accord
xFMaZbc15CQ,440080,441759,this is
xFMaZbc15CQ,441759,445280,the benchmark that everything else
xFMaZbc15CQ,445280,447039,should be compared against i think it's
xFMaZbc15CQ,447039,448880,kind of like the bmw 3 series of this
xFMaZbc15CQ,448880,451840,category
xFMaZbc15CQ,458960,462000,kind of easy to speed in this thing
xFMaZbc15CQ,462000,464000,and speaking of speeding tonight's video
xFMaZbc15CQ,464000,465280,is brought to you by
xFMaZbc15CQ,465280,466960,off the record you may have heard of
xFMaZbc15CQ,466960,468319,these guys they
xFMaZbc15CQ,468319,471280,fight your traffic tickets and i've been
xFMaZbc15CQ,471280,472319,wanting to try them out for quite a
xFMaZbc15CQ,472319,472879,while
xFMaZbc15CQ,472879,474800,and i wasn't going to go out and get a
xFMaZbc15CQ,474800,476879,speeding ticket to try them out
xFMaZbc15CQ,476879,479039,but uh something funny happened a few
xFMaZbc15CQ,479039,479919,weeks ago
xFMaZbc15CQ,479919,482000,two of the guys i work with both got
xFMaZbc15CQ,482000,484240,speeding tickets in the same city on the
xFMaZbc15CQ,484240,484879,same
xFMaZbc15CQ,484879,487039,night not from the same cop though that
xFMaZbc15CQ,487039,488720,would have been pretty funny
xFMaZbc15CQ,488720,490639,so i got in touch with off the record
xFMaZbc15CQ,490639,492800,and i said hey what can you guys do for
xFMaZbc15CQ,492800,493440,us
xFMaZbc15CQ,493440,496560,and they got both speeding tickets
xFMaZbc15CQ,496560,499280,reduced to non-moving violations it was
xFMaZbc15CQ,499280,499599,all
xFMaZbc15CQ,499599,501360,very easy to do all chris and charlie
xFMaZbc15CQ,501360,503599,had to do was upload the photos of their
xFMaZbc15CQ,503599,504400,tickets
xFMaZbc15CQ,504400,506160,to the app and the attorney took care of
xFMaZbc15CQ,506160,508400,the rest save them a bunch of money
xFMaZbc15CQ,508400,510479,in increased insurance premiums in the
xFMaZbc15CQ,510479,511520,long term
xFMaZbc15CQ,511520,513039,and the thing i really like about off
xFMaZbc15CQ,513039,514800,the record is that if you're on a road
xFMaZbc15CQ,514800,515518,trip
xFMaZbc15CQ,515518,518159,and you're passing through a city that's
xFMaZbc15CQ,518159,519599,you know hundreds of miles from your
xFMaZbc15CQ,519599,520320,house
xFMaZbc15CQ,520320,521919,you don't want to go back and fight the
xFMaZbc15CQ,521919,523760,ticket with a court date
xFMaZbc15CQ,523760,526800,you can uh hit up off the record and an
xFMaZbc15CQ,526800,527680,attorney will
xFMaZbc15CQ,527680,529040,fight the ticket for you without you
xFMaZbc15CQ,529040,530720,even having to show up
xFMaZbc15CQ,530720,532959,they have about a 90 coverage throughout
xFMaZbc15CQ,532959,534080,the united states
xFMaZbc15CQ,534080,537519,and uh all the large metropolitan areas
xFMaZbc15CQ,537519,540320,and so pretty good chances that wherever
xFMaZbc15CQ,540320,541600,you get a traffic ticket
xFMaZbc15CQ,541600,543519,you're going to be covered check them
xFMaZbc15CQ,543519,544880,out we've got a discount code here
xFMaZbc15CQ,544880,546560,in the description and top comment of
xFMaZbc15CQ,546560,548640,this video
xFMaZbc15CQ,548640,550720,if you're an accord driver and you're
xFMaZbc15CQ,550720,552080,watching this video
xFMaZbc15CQ,552080,554080,i know you're drive like a maniac i feel
xFMaZbc15CQ,554080,555680,like a core drivers are the new
xFMaZbc15CQ,555680,557519,volkswagen jetta drivers
xFMaZbc15CQ,557519,560160,everyone who had a jetta had reliability
xFMaZbc15CQ,560160,561600,problems and then they've decided to
xFMaZbc15CQ,561600,562720,move to accords
xFMaZbc15CQ,562720,565120,and with this two liter turbo you are
xFMaZbc15CQ,565120,566000,gonna need
xFMaZbc15CQ,566000,571279,some type of help because uh it's fast
xFMaZbc15CQ,571279,572560,all right guys well there's the pov
xFMaZbc15CQ,572560,575200,night drive of the new accord
xFMaZbc15CQ,575200,578560,2021 2-liter turbo sport
xFMaZbc15CQ,578560,580720,really nice car i mean i feel like i'm a
xFMaZbc15CQ,580720,581760,broken record
xFMaZbc15CQ,581760,584240,with every honda accord that i drive i
xFMaZbc15CQ,584240,585680,would recommend any one of them
xFMaZbc15CQ,585680,587680,whether you want the hybrid this 2-liter
xFMaZbc15CQ,587680,590240,turbo sport the 1.5
xFMaZbc15CQ,590240,592720,cvt an older one with the manual you
xFMaZbc15CQ,592720,594480,kind of can't go wrong
xFMaZbc15CQ,594480,597120,personally for a 2021 model year i think
xFMaZbc15CQ,597120,599040,this 2-liter turbo is my favorite
xFMaZbc15CQ,599040,601920,it's just the best all-round vehicle the
xFMaZbc15CQ,601920,603200,hybrid was great
xFMaZbc15CQ,603200,607360,it was a little bit droney with the cvt
xFMaZbc15CQ,607360,610480,but again still a very efficient and
xFMaZbc15CQ,610480,611920,nice to drive package
xFMaZbc15CQ,611920,613279,but i think this two-liter turbo
xFMaZbc15CQ,613279,616720,definitely takes the cake for me
xFMaZbc15CQ,617200,620640,fun color here too tonight
xFMaZbc15CQ,621200,622399,all right guys that's it for this one
