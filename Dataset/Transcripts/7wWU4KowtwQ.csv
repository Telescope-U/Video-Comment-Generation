7wWU4KowtwQ,30470,34980,the Scheldt on the mountain is almost
7wWU4KowtwQ,34980,38280,3000 meters high the finished area is in
7wWU4KowtwQ,38280,40320,the bottom of the valley and you have
7wWU4KowtwQ,40320,42570,very changing conditions from the top to
7wWU4KowtwQ,42570,46650,the bottom the inferno downhill race was
7wWU4KowtwQ,46650,50060,founded 1928
7wWU4KowtwQ,56890,60160,the shorten is not designed for cars
7wWU4KowtwQ,60160,62330,it's designed for skiers to go down
7wWU4KowtwQ,62330,73880,really fast insane skiers I think we
7wWU4KowtwQ,73880,75110,should just do a recce see what it's
7wWU4KowtwQ,75110,77119,like used to the systems and yeah see if
7wWU4KowtwQ,77119,78320,I can map read and drive at the same
7wWU4KowtwQ,78320,83390,time this is phenomenal the traction
7wWU4KowtwQ,83390,85070,again the speed you doing in these
7wWU4KowtwQ,85070,87140,conditions I mean these are bad
7wWU4KowtwQ,87140,102110,conditions I think with a car more
7wWU4KowtwQ,102110,108950,dangerous than with the ski I don't
7wWU4KowtwQ,108950,111140,think a car can do that
7wWU4KowtwQ,111140,113570,it's a huge long stretch it's 15
7wWU4KowtwQ,113570,115130,kilometers of completely hostile
7wWU4KowtwQ,115130,119648,territory and every corners an emergency
7wWU4KowtwQ,127140,130979,one of the secrets of Inferno is never
7wWU4KowtwQ,130979,139310,break breaking means losing
7wWU4KowtwQ,194830,197830,I know the place from the sky and from
7wWU4KowtwQ,197830,200170,the grounds and I can tell you it's
7wWU4KowtwQ,200170,206410,really really steep and the rescue
7wWU4KowtwQ,206410,208900,helicopter will be there to take Ben and
7wWU4KowtwQ,208900,212819,breathing very fast to the hospital
