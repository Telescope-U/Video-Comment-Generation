f1K37qLEvm0,3360,4720,hey guys what's up it's joe brady from
f1K37qLEvm0,4720,6240,ladies rides i'm back here at one of my
f1K37qLEvm0,6240,7680,favorite parking lots because you know
f1K37qLEvm0,7680,8240,what
f1K37qLEvm0,8240,10240,we have a very interesting car this is a
f1K37qLEvm0,10240,11440,2021
f1K37qLEvm0,11440,15200,infiniti q60 red sport 400
f1K37qLEvm0,15200,17440,all-wheel drive but before we get into
f1K37qLEvm0,17440,18640,this mouthful
f1K37qLEvm0,18640,20800,of a gt sports car let's talk about
f1K37qLEvm0,20800,21920,what's going on here
f1K37qLEvm0,21920,24800,infiniti the premium brand of nissan is
f1K37qLEvm0,24800,25359,gonna
f1K37qLEvm0,25359,27039,be doing a little bit of a renaissance
f1K37qLEvm0,27039,28720,of their own just like
f1K37qLEvm0,28720,30640,the nissan brand now what's fascinating
f1K37qLEvm0,30640,32160,is that this q60
f1K37qLEvm0,32160,35840,being a red sport 400 has a glimpse
f1K37qLEvm0,35840,38879,of what that 2022 nissan z is gonna have
f1K37qLEvm0,38879,40800,that's that twin turbo v6
f1K37qLEvm0,40800,44559,underneath the hood 400 horsepower
f1K37qLEvm0,44559,46239,it's fascinating because this car has
f1K37qLEvm0,46239,48079,been around since 2017
f1K37qLEvm0,48079,49600,and even though it hasn't gone through a
f1K37qLEvm0,49600,51120,major redesign yet
f1K37qLEvm0,51120,53120,still looking very very fresh
f1K37qLEvm0,53120,54239,aesthetically
f1K37qLEvm0,54239,56160,almost like a timeless design but what i
f1K37qLEvm0,56160,57680,want to find out is that if you're
f1K37qLEvm0,57680,60399,looking at the competition the lexus rcf
f1K37qLEvm0,60399,64320,the bmw m440i is this
f1K37qLEvm0,64320,67760,infiniti q60 red sport 400
f1K37qLEvm0,67760,70320,is it not only a long name but is it the
f1K37qLEvm0,70320,70799,one
f1K37qLEvm0,70799,72880,to be parking in your garage that just
f1K37qLEvm0,72880,74799,has that unique style
f1K37qLEvm0,74799,77200,and driving experience that maybe the
f1K37qLEvm0,77200,78880,competition doesn't have
f1K37qLEvm0,78880,81520,also i want to find out really is this a
f1K37qLEvm0,81520,82240,glimpse
f1K37qLEvm0,82240,84720,to the nissan z with that same engine
f1K37qLEvm0,84720,86400,set up but while we go ahead let's dive
f1K37qLEvm0,86400,87520,into this 22
f1K37qLEvm0,87520,90400,21 model and find out right off the bat
f1K37qLEvm0,90400,91680,i love the lines
f1K37qLEvm0,91680,94479,on this car especially the proportions
f1K37qLEvm0,94479,95680,when you start at the front of the
f1K37qLEvm0,95680,96400,business
f1K37qLEvm0,96400,99040,great job on the styling of the led
f1K37qLEvm0,99040,100320,daytime running lamps
f1K37qLEvm0,100320,102479,especially the way you have the top brow
f1K37qLEvm0,102479,104159,and then you have that lower section
f1K37qLEvm0,104159,106320,you do have a projector beam led
f1K37qLEvm0,106320,107600,headlight in there
f1K37qLEvm0,107600,108960,most of it is blacked out on the
f1K37qLEvm0,108960,110560,interior with just a little bit of shiny
f1K37qLEvm0,110560,111280,chrome
f1K37qLEvm0,111280,113920,we dropped down the good news is no fake
f1K37qLEvm0,113920,114880,vent it actually
f1K37qLEvm0,114880,118320,houses a led fog lamp
f1K37qLEvm0,118320,120960,and i'm liking the carbon fiber trim
f1K37qLEvm0,120960,122320,almost looks like a vent
f1K37qLEvm0,122320,124399,but i'm glad they saved it by putting
f1K37qLEvm0,124399,126560,the fog lamp in there now i like the way
f1K37qLEvm0,126560,128160,they have this little extra
f1K37qLEvm0,128160,130800,lip extension built into the front
f1K37qLEvm0,130800,131360,fascia
f1K37qLEvm0,131360,133280,but i'll be honest with you this carbon
f1K37qLEvm0,133280,134879,fiber which is the real deal
f1K37qLEvm0,134879,137360,looks great i would like to see a carbon
f1K37qLEvm0,137360,138560,fiber splitter
f1K37qLEvm0,138560,140319,added to it i think that would just be
f1K37qLEvm0,140319,142400,the cherry on top of this beautiful
f1K37qLEvm0,142400,144480,sundae now as we come across
f1K37qLEvm0,144480,147680,that low slung hood all gloss black and
f1K37qLEvm0,147680,149280,i'm glad they went in that direction you
f1K37qLEvm0,149280,149920,know
f1K37qLEvm0,149920,152319,i've seen it with chrome looks tasteful
f1K37qLEvm0,152319,154160,as well but the gloss black with the
f1K37qLEvm0,154160,156000,white really pops nicely you have that
f1K37qLEvm0,156000,159200,infinity badge up top it's got a nice
f1K37qLEvm0,159200,162319,wavy feel to the grill it's not
f1K37qLEvm0,162319,164959,just a simple you know hexagon shape or
f1K37qLEvm0,164959,165760,honey
f1K37qLEvm0,165760,167680,honeycomb shape i like the way it almost
f1K37qLEvm0,167680,169840,looks like waves on an ocean now drop
f1K37qLEvm0,169840,170400,down
f1K37qLEvm0,170400,173120,that same design this is flat black to
f1K37qLEvm0,173120,174640,take a little bit better beating but the
f1K37qLEvm0,174640,175599,great news is
f1K37qLEvm0,175599,177760,all functional and as you can see you do
f1K37qLEvm0,177760,179519,have that little lip extension
f1K37qLEvm0,179519,181680,but it would just be perfect to have
f1K37qLEvm0,181680,183120,that splitter
f1K37qLEvm0,183120,184879,especially carbon fiber now when we get
f1K37qLEvm0,184879,186720,up onto that low slung hood
f1K37qLEvm0,186720,189120,you do have a rise here coming off of
f1K37qLEvm0,189120,190000,the grill
f1K37qLEvm0,190000,192319,into the top portion of the front fascia
f1K37qLEvm0,192319,194239,and then disappears as you get
f1K37qLEvm0,194239,197280,into the hood simple but
f1K37qLEvm0,197280,199440,just visually aesthetic lines you're
f1K37qLEvm0,199440,200319,just gonna have
f1K37qLEvm0,200319,202560,a nice rise on each side and it goes
f1K37qLEvm0,202560,204239,towards the eight pillars now as we come
f1K37qLEvm0,204239,205200,around the bend
f1K37qLEvm0,205200,207920,on this red sport 400 what are we
f1K37qLEvm0,207920,209760,working with wheel and tires so
f1K37qLEvm0,209760,211519,up front you can see you're gonna get
f1K37qLEvm0,211519,213760,this five-spoke wheel
f1K37qLEvm0,213760,216720,machine aluminum with that gunmetal gray
f1K37qLEvm0,216720,217840,metallic finish
f1K37qLEvm0,217840,219920,and you know what i think it's working
f1K37qLEvm0,219920,221360,it really works well
f1K37qLEvm0,221360,223440,with the color of this car and if you're
f1K37qLEvm0,223440,224640,wondering what joe what's the size of
f1K37qLEvm0,224640,226239,this wheel it's a 20 inch wheel
f1K37qLEvm0,226239,229200,255 on the width 35 series sidewall you
f1K37qLEvm0,229200,230400,got that bright red
f1K37qLEvm0,230400,232720,four piston caliper going to clamp down
f1K37qLEvm0,232720,233680,on a fully
f1K37qLEvm0,233680,236239,ventilated rotor and i don't know i
f1K37qLEvm0,236239,237439,think a lot of wheels
f1K37qLEvm0,237439,239840,they're going to black everybody's using
f1K37qLEvm0,239840,240640,black color
f1K37qLEvm0,240640,242000,it's nice to have something just a
f1K37qLEvm0,242000,243599,little bit different and like i said
f1K37qLEvm0,243599,245360,with this pearlescent white
f1K37qLEvm0,245360,247040,i think it balances nicely especially
f1K37qLEvm0,247040,249120,with that that tomato sauce
f1K37qLEvm0,249120,251599,red caliper that you have there that is
f1K37qLEvm0,251599,253120,also going to give us some nice breaking
f1K37qLEvm0,253120,254799,capability now as we go
f1K37qLEvm0,254799,257359,down the fender you are gonna have this
f1K37qLEvm0,257359,259280,side vent which is functional with the
f1K37qLEvm0,259280,261359,carbon fiber which is nice
f1K37qLEvm0,261359,263120,kind of ties it into what's happening at
f1K37qLEvm0,263120,264880,the front of the business you'll notice
f1K37qLEvm0,264880,265600,a nice
f1K37qLEvm0,265600,268320,side sill extension flat black but then
f1K37qLEvm0,268320,269680,you're going to get the body colored
f1K37qLEvm0,269680,270800,extension that goes
f1K37qLEvm0,270800,273120,all the way down and kind of tapers as
f1K37qLEvm0,273120,275280,it comes into that flared fender
f1K37qLEvm0,275280,277680,kind of look now full carbon fiber
f1K37qLEvm0,277680,279440,mirror cap so we have carbon fiber up
f1K37qLEvm0,279440,280000,front
f1K37qLEvm0,280000,282400,on the sides and on the mirror caps you
f1K37qLEvm0,282400,283759,do have a sunroof
f1K37qLEvm0,283759,285280,would have been nice if they blacked out
f1K37qLEvm0,285280,286800,the whole roof that would have been a
f1K37qLEvm0,286800,288240,nice extra touch
f1K37qLEvm0,288240,290560,some bright shiny metal work on the door
f1K37qLEvm0,290560,292320,handle and on the base
f1K37qLEvm0,292320,294080,of where the window frame is i wish they
f1K37qLEvm0,294080,295440,would have went like
f1K37qLEvm0,295440,297680,black chrome so i am going to zonk the
f1K37qLEvm0,297680,298720,shiny metal work
f1K37qLEvm0,298720,300400,but i do like the design i mean how
f1K37qLEvm0,300400,302639,unique is that especially for that large
f1K37qLEvm0,302639,303840,quarter window
f1K37qLEvm0,303840,305919,love the way the body line picks up here
f1K37qLEvm0,305919,307360,that's that width i want to look at the
f1K37qLEvm0,307360,308400,rear though
f1K37qLEvm0,308400,310240,and just really showcase that you're
f1K37qLEvm0,310240,311600,going to get those nice
f1K37qLEvm0,311600,313680,calipers both at the front of the
f1K37qLEvm0,313680,314800,vehicle and
f1K37qLEvm0,314800,316639,also at the back and of course we're
f1K37qLEvm0,316639,317840,getting all-wheel drive
f1K37qLEvm0,317840,320000,that's going to keep us stuck to the
f1K37qLEvm0,320000,322479,ground and you're going to get 255s out
f1K37qLEvm0,322479,323199,back as well
f1K37qLEvm0,323199,326320,all four corners 255 on that width when
f1K37qLEvm0,326320,327759,we come around to the tail end of the
f1K37qLEvm0,327759,328320,business
f1K37qLEvm0,328320,330960,they finish it off with a beautiful
f1K37qLEvm0,330960,332960,carbon fiber trunk lid spoiler i love
f1K37qLEvm0,332960,334639,the way it extends out look at the way
f1K37qLEvm0,334639,336160,the trunk kind of goes in but then the
f1K37qLEvm0,336160,338000,carbon fiber spoiler comes
f1K37qLEvm0,338000,339680,off this is a functional piece you got
f1K37qLEvm0,339680,341759,your all-wheel drive badge
f1K37qLEvm0,341759,344800,tasteful on the tail lights the infiniti
f1K37qLEvm0,344800,345520,name
f1K37qLEvm0,345520,349440,q60s 400 red sport
f1K37qLEvm0,349440,351840,nicely done and then we drop back and i
f1K37qLEvm0,351840,353840,really am digging the exhaust
f1K37qLEvm0,353840,356479,nice simple round slash cut and the
f1K37qLEvm0,356479,357520,little
f1K37qLEvm0,357520,359840,intricate design that they did if you
f1K37qLEvm0,359840,361919,noticed if you were watching the nissan
f1K37qLEvm0,361919,363039,z review that we did
f1K37qLEvm0,363039,365680,at the headquarters same exact exhaust
f1K37qLEvm0,365680,366880,with a gloss black
f1K37qLEvm0,366880,368720,lower rear bumper area but why don't we
f1K37qLEvm0,368720,370319,pop that hood and see that twin turbo
f1K37qLEvm0,370319,370720,power
f1K37qLEvm0,370720,372080,guys we got the hood popped you do have
f1K37qLEvm0,372080,374319,hydraulic hood struts i like the engine
f1K37qLEvm0,374319,376240,cover very tasteful and like i said this
f1K37qLEvm0,376240,377680,gives us a glimpse
f1K37qLEvm0,377680,380880,into the upcoming 2022 z but what are we
f1K37qLEvm0,380880,382319,looking at we're looking at that three
f1K37qLEvm0,382319,383039,liter
f1K37qLEvm0,383039,386080,v6 twin turbo 400 horsepower
f1K37qLEvm0,386080,388560,350 pound feet of torque a little bit of
f1K37qLEvm0,388560,390319,a bummer there's only one transmission
f1K37qLEvm0,390319,390880,option
f1K37qLEvm0,390880,394160,it is a seven speed automatic 0 to 60 in
f1K37qLEvm0,394160,396000,about 4.3 seconds
f1K37qLEvm0,396000,398400,quarter mile is going to go by at 12.7
f1K37qLEvm0,398400,399199,seconds
f1K37qLEvm0,399199,402240,top speed is 150 miles an hour the car
f1K37qLEvm0,402240,402800,weighs
f1K37qLEvm0,402800,405919,around 4 000 pounds mpgs
f1K37qLEvm0,405919,409120,19 in the city 26 on the highway when
f1K37qLEvm0,409120,410400,you're comparing this
f1K37qLEvm0,410400,413840,to the competition you think rcf rcf is
f1K37qLEvm0,413840,414960,going to pull in a little bit more
f1K37qLEvm0,414960,416039,horsepower
f1K37qLEvm0,416039,419120,m440i a little bit less but you know
f1K37qLEvm0,419120,421120,what while we go ahead let's fire it up

f1K37qLEvm0,494160,495680,pockets are pretty good size you could
f1K37qLEvm0,495680,497440,probably get a whopper in there
f1K37qLEvm0,497440,500400,and a can of coca-cola and we have the
f1K37qLEvm0,500400,501199,bose
f1K37qLEvm0,501199,504000,performance sound system with a nice
f1K37qLEvm0,504000,504639,tasteful
f1K37qLEvm0,504639,507440,aluminum speaker cover there if i do say
f1K37qLEvm0,507440,509360,so myself now when you go from the door
f1K37qLEvm0,509360,510720,panel to the dash
f1K37qLEvm0,510720,512800,i like the way this portion is way
f1K37qLEvm0,512800,514399,forward for the passenger
f1K37qLEvm0,514399,516640,you do get the stitching which is great
f1K37qLEvm0,516640,518240,but then
f1K37qLEvm0,518240,519760,things are going to get a little wonky
f1K37qLEvm0,519760,522000,here so like i was saying
f1K37qLEvm0,522000,524240,about the exterior being timeless the
f1K37qLEvm0,524240,525040,interior
f1K37qLEvm0,525040,528399,is not as timeless you do have that
f1K37qLEvm0,528399,531760,older split screen set up eight inches
f1K37qLEvm0,531760,532560,up top
f1K37qLEvm0,532560,534800,seven inches down below the great news
f1K37qLEvm0,534800,536399,is you're eight inches up top
f1K37qLEvm0,536399,538560,you're going to be getting navigation
f1K37qLEvm0,538560,540000,put it in reverse
f1K37qLEvm0,540000,541519,that's where we have our backup camera
f1K37qLEvm0,541519,543920,now it's a little on the grainy side
f1K37qLEvm0,543920,546320,but the good news is we got 360 cam
f1K37qLEvm0,546320,547440,trajectory
f1K37qLEvm0,547440,548800,and you could change the view look at
f1K37qLEvm0,548800,550880,those 20 inch wheels bling bling
f1K37qLEvm0,550880,553680,20 inch wheels so nice to have that kind
f1K37qLEvm0,553680,554880,of flexibility
f1K37qLEvm0,554880,556399,i do like the way they brought more
f1K37qLEvm0,556399,558720,carbon fiber though that is a nice touch
f1K37qLEvm0,558720,560560,you got the start stop button up top
f1K37qLEvm0,560560,561760,over here
f1K37qLEvm0,561760,564399,seven inch display obviously apple
f1K37qLEvm0,564399,565200,carplay
f1K37qLEvm0,565200,568160,sirius xm is it a touchscreen yes of
f1K37qLEvm0,568160,570080,course it's a touchscreen watch
f1K37qLEvm0,570080,571839,see i touched it and it did something so
f1K37qLEvm0,571839,573600,i'm gonna go back to channel list here
f1K37qLEvm0,573600,574720,and then we're gonna you know how we
f1K37qLEvm0,574720,576399,doing on radius rise where we're going
f1K37qLEvm0,576399,577680,we're going 80s on eight
f1K37qLEvm0,577680,580560,heck yeah a little bit of gloss black
f1K37qLEvm0,580560,581839,it's interesting because
f1K37qLEvm0,581839,584240,if it was just this screen i think it
f1K37qLEvm0,584240,585120,would just
f1K37qLEvm0,585120,587680,be perfect but because of the two
f1K37qLEvm0,587680,589440,screens i don't know i'm
f1K37qLEvm0,589440,590959,just something a little bit bothersome
f1K37qLEvm0,590959,592640,but this is the forward-facing camera
f1K37qLEvm0,592640,594080,that we have up top which is great for
f1K37qLEvm0,594080,595760,you to see now as you come down you do
f1K37qLEvm0,595760,596800,have a cd player
f1K37qLEvm0,596800,599120,so get out your pearl jam cds maybe some
f1K37qLEvm0,599120,599920,warrant
f1K37qLEvm0,599920,602480,maybe some sir mix-a-lob whatever your
f1K37qLEvm0,602480,604160,your flavor of music is
f1K37qLEvm0,604160,606160,pop that cd in there you do have your
f1K37qLEvm0,606160,607680,dual climate control and what's
f1K37qLEvm0,607680,609519,interesting is watch this
f1K37qLEvm0,609519,612079,i have buttons over here to go through
f1K37qLEvm0,612079,614240,the dual climate but
f1K37qLEvm0,614240,616480,you could also go this route watch this
f1K37qLEvm0,616480,617600,climb it
f1K37qLEvm0,617600,619519,now i can adjust it right on the screen
f1K37qLEvm0,619519,621200,of course you got a heated steering
f1K37qLEvm0,621200,621680,wheel
f1K37qLEvm0,621680,624720,or like they say here steering heater
f1K37qLEvm0,624720,626399,easily touch i don't need it right now
f1K37qLEvm0,626399,627839,because it's kind of a hot day
f1K37qLEvm0,627839,629200,here in florida then we're right back
f1K37qLEvm0,629200,631519,again drop keep dropping down
f1K37qLEvm0,631519,633040,you do have heated seats but no
f1K37qLEvm0,633040,634800,ventilated seats and that's a zonk
f1K37qLEvm0,634800,636320,at this price point i would like to have
f1K37qLEvm0,636320,638320,ventilated seats we open up this little
f1K37qLEvm0,638320,638800,guy

f1K37qLEvm0,640079,642720,way you have a little tiny felt line
f1K37qLEvm0,642720,644800,cubby what i would probably put in here
f1K37qLEvm0,644800,648560,is maybe if you have some diamonds like
f1K37qLEvm0,648560,649920,maybe you're just walking around with
f1K37qLEvm0,649920,651360,some diamonds some loose diamonds in
f1K37qLEvm0,651360,652800,your pocket you could drop it in here

f1K37qLEvm0,821760,823519,did the horn button looks classy
f1K37qLEvm0,823519,825040,flat black on the buttons you do have
f1K37qLEvm0,825040,826720,plastic paddles to go
f1K37qLEvm0,826720,829120,up and down that seven speed automatic
f1K37qLEvm0,829120,831120,transmission only transmission
f1K37qLEvm0,831120,833120,where it gets a little dated that some
f1K37qLEvm0,833120,835040,people might not really like
f1K37qLEvm0,835040,837440,are the gauges i don't mind it i do like
f1K37qLEvm0,837440,839120,the way they did the bezels around there
f1K37qLEvm0,839120,840639,a little bit of decoration
f1K37qLEvm0,840639,842000,to kind of tie it in with everything
f1K37qLEvm0,842000,843360,else but you have your tack you have
f1K37qLEvm0,843360,845440,your speedometer coolant and fuel gauge
f1K37qLEvm0,845440,847040,and then you have that digital display
f1K37qLEvm0,847040,848639,in the center which you could scroll
f1K37qLEvm0,848639,849199,through some
f1K37qLEvm0,849199,851600,information one of those things where
f1K37qLEvm0,851600,853920,yes there are brands like bmw
f1K37qLEvm0,853920,857199,doing full digital gauge pods but hey
f1K37qLEvm0,857199,859440,i still think analog gauges are where
f1K37qLEvm0,859440,860320,they're at
f1K37qLEvm0,860320,862480,overall though very very comfy we're
f1K37qLEvm0,862480,863519,gonna do it because i know you're
f1K37qLEvm0,863519,865519,probably gonna complain if we don't
f1K37qLEvm0,865519,866800,let's go ahead and get into the back
f1K37qLEvm0,866800,868720,seat and see how usable it is
f1K37qLEvm0,868720,871440,in this q60 hey guys we're in the back

f1K37qLEvm0,888720,890480,which the competition does have
f1K37qLEvm0,890480,893839,so don't say hey where's the ac vents

f1K37qLEvm0,897519,899680,on the backs of the seats which is nice
f1K37qLEvm0,899680,901040,and you could probably put a back
f1K37qLEvm0,901040,903120,scratcher in there maybe a
f1K37qLEvm0,903120,906160,a nice little small throw pillow because
f1K37qLEvm0,906160,908000,i'm gonna you're gonna want something to
f1K37qLEvm0,908000,910079,kind of soften this up a little bit
f1K37qLEvm0,910079,910880,because

f1K37qLEvm0,913440,914720,this is me

f1K37qLEvm0,940800,943600,and there's some really decent depth to
f1K37qLEvm0,943600,945519,this gt style sports car now if you're
f1K37qLEvm0,945519,946399,wondering well joe
f1K37qLEvm0,946399,948800,how much room is there exactly you're
f1K37qLEvm0,948800,950079,basically looking at
f1K37qLEvm0,950079,952720,around a little under 10 cubic feet of
f1K37qLEvm0,952720,953600,space
f1K37qLEvm0,953600,955680,i do really think though that it's
f1K37qLEvm0,955680,956639,usable space
f1K37qLEvm0,956639,958959,that you can enjoy this car easily every
f1K37qLEvm0,958959,959920,single day
f1K37qLEvm0,959920,961519,plus you're gonna have that twin turbo
f1K37qLEvm0,961519,963199,power but since we're talking about twin
f1K37qLEvm0,963199,964399,turbo power
f1K37qLEvm0,964399,967040,if you're ready i'm ready infiniti gave
f1K37qLEvm0,967040,969199,us the keys let's go on throttle in this
f1K37qLEvm0,969199,970639,q60 red sport
f1K37qLEvm0,970639,973959,as we're inside the infinity
f1K37qLEvm0,973959,976959,q60 red sport 400
f1K37qLEvm0,976959,980079,all-wheel drive from a dead stop i have
f1K37qLEvm0,980079,982000,it in sport plus mode here we
f1K37qLEvm0,982000,986079,go on throttle yeah
f1K37qLEvm0,988000,996320,on the brakes
f1K37qLEvm0,996320,998800,good
f1K37qLEvm0,1001440,1003360,having an automatic mode that seven
f1K37qLEvm0,1003360,1005759,speed automatic doing its thing
f1K37qLEvm0,1005759,1011839,on the brakes
f1K37qLEvm0,1013600,1016319,there we go
f1K37qLEvm0,1019279,1025280,rake's feeling good
f1K37qLEvm0,1025280,1027919,nice
f1K37qLEvm0,1028720,1031520,so let's talk about this for a second
f1K37qLEvm0,1031520,1031839,this
f1K37qLEvm0,1031839,1036000,is like i said more of a gt style
f1K37qLEvm0,1036000,1039280,sports car that gentleman's
f1K37qLEvm0,1039280,1043120,touring vehicle it definitely has power
f1K37qLEvm0,1043120,1044880,that 400 horsepower it's going to be
f1K37qLEvm0,1044880,1047600,interesting to be in a lighter car
f1K37qLEvm0,1047600,1050240,rear wheel drive when we get behind the
f1K37qLEvm0,1050240,1051200,wheel of the new
f1K37qLEvm0,1051200,1054320,z that's coming but i think one of the
f1K37qLEvm0,1054320,1055840,things that's kind of throwing me off a
f1K37qLEvm0,1055840,1056720,little bit
f1K37qLEvm0,1056720,1059679,is that electronic steering that this
f1K37qLEvm0,1059679,1060400,has
f1K37qLEvm0,1060400,1064480,it's a little bit different experience
f1K37qLEvm0,1064480,1066400,i'm wishing it gave me some more
f1K37qLEvm0,1066400,1068000,feedback especially
f1K37qLEvm0,1068000,1070240,in some of those twisty bits i just
f1K37qLEvm0,1070240,1072240,don't feel very connected with what the
f1K37qLEvm0,1072240,1073679,front end of the car is doing it's
f1K37qLEvm0,1073679,1075120,definitely planted
f1K37qLEvm0,1075120,1077039,definitely have plenty of grips so
f1K37qLEvm0,1077039,1078880,that's the good news
f1K37qLEvm0,1078880,1080960,with the all-wheel drive system seven
f1K37qLEvm0,1080960,1083679,speed shifts pretty smooth
f1K37qLEvm0,1083679,1087200,it wasn't exactly always in
f1K37qLEvm0,1087200,1089360,the exact gear i wanted but what we're
f1K37qLEvm0,1089360,1090799,going to do is obviously
f1K37qLEvm0,1090799,1093760,put it over into manual shift mode and
f1K37qLEvm0,1093760,1094080,take
f1K37qLEvm0,1094080,1096880,care of that for our next twisty bit go
f1K37qLEvm0,1096880,1098240,around but
f1K37qLEvm0,1098240,1101200,when it comes to the leather the carbon
f1K37qLEvm0,1101200,1102080,fiber
f1K37qLEvm0,1102080,1104799,the visibility the seats those things
f1K37qLEvm0,1104799,1105760,are spot on
f1K37qLEvm0,1105760,1107840,spot on the money especially visibility
f1K37qLEvm0,1107840,1109280,off the back glass
f1K37qLEvm0,1109280,1112480,i like the side mirrors especially
f1K37qLEvm0,1112480,1114559,because they're covered in carbon fiber
f1K37qLEvm0,1114559,1117440,but i just wish there was a little bit
f1K37qLEvm0,1117440,1117919,more
f1K37qLEvm0,1117919,1121760,something with the steering and that's
f1K37qLEvm0,1121760,1125440,you know a unique aspect of the infiniti
f1K37qLEvm0,1125440,1128559,q60 comparing this to
f1K37qLEvm0,1128559,1132960,say a lexus rcf or a bmw
f1K37qLEvm0,1132960,1134480,you're you're going to be getting a
f1K37qLEvm0,1134480,1136880,little bit more of everything
f1K37qLEvm0,1136880,1138720,especially when it comes to overall
f1K37qLEvm0,1138720,1141280,power or that connected
f1K37qLEvm0,1141280,1143039,feeling to what the front wheels are
f1K37qLEvm0,1143039,1145120,doing like i said all-wheel drive works
f1K37qLEvm0,1145120,1146320,great very planted
f1K37qLEvm0,1146320,1148840,the gauges are easy to read easy to
f1K37qLEvm0,1148840,1150640,understand
f1K37qLEvm0,1150640,1153600,i just it just needs to be dialed up a
f1K37qLEvm0,1153600,1155600,notch and i do have it like i said
f1K37qLEvm0,1155600,1157840,in sport plus mode all right guys manual
f1K37qLEvm0,1157840,1159520,shift mode second gear
f1K37qLEvm0,1159520,1165840,high throttle here we go nice shifts
f1K37qLEvm0,1169780,1172480,[Music]
f1K37qLEvm0,1172480,1179360,feeling good now oh yeah here we go nice
f1K37qLEvm0,1179360,1182720,decreasing radius
f1K37qLEvm0,1186720,1188480,that was a good i like i really like the
f1K37qLEvm0,1188480,1191200,way that fell through that turn
f1K37qLEvm0,1191200,1193520,brakes feel phenomenal though definitely
f1K37qLEvm0,1193520,1194720,feel phenomenal
f1K37qLEvm0,1194720,1196640,and we're not talking about six piston
f1K37qLEvm0,1196640,1198320,calipers or anything like that
f1K37qLEvm0,1198320,1201200,those are four piston calipers up front
f1K37qLEvm0,1201200,1202240,and definitely
f1K37qLEvm0,1202240,1205760,nice rock solid pedal feel
f1K37qLEvm0,1205760,1207919,shifting with the paddles allowed me a
f1K37qLEvm0,1207919,1209120,little bit more
f1K37qLEvm0,1209120,1211679,control over obviously what the heck is
f1K37qLEvm0,1211679,1213679,going on here
f1K37qLEvm0,1213679,1215760,steering like i said just just a little
f1K37qLEvm0,1215760,1217679,bit more feel
f1K37qLEvm0,1217679,1220240,maybe like halfway to almost full on
f1K37qLEvm0,1220240,1221360,feel i would just like
f1K37qLEvm0,1221360,1223360,something a little bit more with the
f1K37qLEvm0,1223360,1225280,feedback so that i could tell what the
f1K37qLEvm0,1225280,1227120,car is doing
f1K37qLEvm0,1227120,1229600,but the v6 twin turbo you're not waiting
f1K37qLEvm0,1229600,1231360,for the boost to kick in you really are
f1K37qLEvm0,1231360,1232000,not
f1K37qLEvm0,1232000,1235440,because it having those two turbos
f1K37qLEvm0,1235440,1238240,really kind of offsets any kind of boost
f1K37qLEvm0,1238240,1239919,lag whatsoever
f1K37qLEvm0,1239919,1243120,all right guys here we are ready to do
f1K37qLEvm0,1243120,1243919,another run
f1K37qLEvm0,1243919,1246640,from a slow roll second gear let me drop
f1K37qLEvm0,1246640,1248640,it down the first
f1K37qLEvm0,1248640,1253840,arthro here we go yeah nice
f1K37qLEvm0,1255200,1257679,breaks
f1K37qLEvm0,1258400,1263840,here we go now we're talking
f1K37qLEvm0,1264960,1268080,this corner is great
f1K37qLEvm0,1271760,1276320,yeah oh yeah
f1K37qLEvm0,1276320,1280240,nice all right so let's talk about this
f1K37qLEvm0,1280240,1281760,a little bit
f1K37qLEvm0,1281760,1284400,utilizing the paddles is definitely the
f1K37qLEvm0,1284400,1285679,better way to go
f1K37qLEvm0,1285679,1287760,especially because of that engagement
f1K37qLEvm0,1287760,1289440,you're getting now
f1K37qLEvm0,1289440,1291360,going through that last set of twisty
f1K37qLEvm0,1291360,1293679,bits
f1K37qLEvm0,1294240,1296799,it's it's it's hard you know you
f1K37qLEvm0,1296799,1298400,definitely need some more steering
f1K37qLEvm0,1298400,1300240,feedback is it terrible
f1K37qLEvm0,1300240,1302960,no i just would like more feedback and
f1K37qLEvm0,1302960,1304799,more weight out of the steering so that
f1K37qLEvm0,1304799,1306400,i know what the front
f1K37qLEvm0,1306400,1308159,end of the vehicle is doing the great
f1K37qLEvm0,1308159,1310400,news is the all-wheel drive keeps you so
f1K37qLEvm0,1310400,1313200,planted you're not worried about losing
f1K37qLEvm0,1313200,1314640,grip
f1K37qLEvm0,1314640,1317280,having that v6 twin turbo power like i
f1K37qLEvm0,1317280,1318320,said you know
f1K37qLEvm0,1318320,1322159,the two turbos cut down on that that
f1K37qLEvm0,1322159,1322960,boost lag
f1K37qLEvm0,1322960,1326480,problem and really get you up to speed
f1K37qLEvm0,1326480,1328640,what i am really digging are the fine
f1K37qLEvm0,1328640,1330159,touches in here
f1K37qLEvm0,1330159,1332960,these seats are so comfortable and the
f1K37qLEvm0,1332960,1334240,way that they have
f1K37qLEvm0,1334240,1337520,the electric assist on the bolstering
f1K37qLEvm0,1337520,1340400,but also on that lower lumbar really
f1K37qLEvm0,1340400,1341760,allows you to
f1K37qLEvm0,1341760,1344880,to perfect it to your body type and then
f1K37qLEvm0,1344880,1346320,everywhere you look in here you
f1K37qLEvm0,1346320,1348320,you're getting nice quality materials i
f1K37qLEvm0,1348320,1350480,would like metal paddles
f1K37qLEvm0,1350480,1351600,on the back of the steering wheel
f1K37qLEvm0,1351600,1353760,they're a good size i just would like
f1K37qLEvm0,1353760,1354480,them out of
f1K37qLEvm0,1354480,1355679,made out of metal i think that would
f1K37qLEvm0,1355679,1357840,just elevate the the quality feel
f1K37qLEvm0,1357840,1359120,something that you're touching
f1K37qLEvm0,1359120,1360640,like that but the steering wheel is a
f1K37qLEvm0,1360640,1363120,great thickness
f1K37qLEvm0,1363120,1366000,and the chassis balance overall is quite
f1K37qLEvm0,1366000,1367120,impressive
f1K37qLEvm0,1367120,1369360,especially on those decreasing radius
f1K37qLEvm0,1369360,1370960,turns with bumps
f1K37qLEvm0,1370960,1373919,the q60 really hunkered down and it's
f1K37qLEvm0,1373919,1375360,going to be interesting to see
f1K37qLEvm0,1375360,1378320,how this translates over to the nissan z
f1K37qLEvm0,1378320,1380559,with it sharing the same engine
f1K37qLEvm0,1380559,1382799,but with it being real wheel drive and
f1K37qLEvm0,1382799,1384000,less horsepower
f1K37qLEvm0,1384000,1386720,excuse me same horsepower but less
f1K37qLEvm0,1386720,1387200,weight
f1K37qLEvm0,1387200,1389120,so that's going to be very interesting
f1K37qLEvm0,1389120,1391039,to see and of course we're going to be
f1K37qLEvm0,1391039,1392960,featuring on radies rise but this is
f1K37qLEvm0,1392960,1393679,really
f1K37qLEvm0,1393679,1397840,a gentleman's gt touring sports car
f1K37qLEvm0,1397840,1401280,style of a vehicle would i get this
f1K37qLEvm0,1401280,1404960,over a lexus rcf i'm not too sure
f1K37qLEvm0,1404960,1407120,the good news is you get all-wheel drive
f1K37qLEvm0,1407120,1409200,so i know especially for people living
f1K37qLEvm0,1409200,1409919,up north
f1K37qLEvm0,1409919,1412240,that's something uh that's super
f1K37qLEvm0,1412240,1412960,important
f1K37qLEvm0,1412960,1415440,with snow and whatnot but when you're
f1K37qLEvm0,1415440,1416559,going on those long
f1K37qLEvm0,1416559,1418640,drives on the highway this thing really
f1K37qLEvm0,1418640,1420240,does glide nicely
f1K37qLEvm0,1420240,1423200,on long straight roads and sucks up all
f1K37qLEvm0,1423200,1424799,the divots and bumps
f1K37qLEvm0,1424799,1427760,super super well i do like the vantage
f1K37qLEvm0,1427760,1429120,point i'm getting of the
f1K37qLEvm0,1429120,1431520,peaks on the fenders allows you to hit
f1K37qLEvm0,1431520,1432480,your marks
f1K37qLEvm0,1432480,1434880,really really nicely all right guys here
f1K37qLEvm0,1434880,1436000,we go one more time
f1K37qLEvm0,1436000,1438720,on throttle
f1K37qLEvm0,1448720,1459840,definitely better using the paddles
f1K37qLEvm0,1462320,1464960,nice
f1K37qLEvm0,1466480,1473840,chica boogie
f1K37qLEvm0,1477360,1479600,so this car just proves that you can
f1K37qLEvm0,1479600,1481600,have fun in the twisty bits but if you
f1K37qLEvm0,1481600,1482640,also want that
f1K37qLEvm0,1482640,1486240,polished overall experience driving it
f1K37qLEvm0,1486240,1487200,every day
f1K37qLEvm0,1487200,1488880,having some of those finer touches on
f1K37qLEvm0,1488880,1491120,the interior you could have that as well
f1K37qLEvm0,1491120,1494400,so but we're gonna do a couple more runs
f1K37qLEvm0,1494400,1497120,just for you all right guys here we go i
f1K37qLEvm0,1497120,1498880,throw one more time for you one more
f1K37qLEvm0,1498880,1501840,time for me
f1K37qLEvm0,1502760,1503919,[Music]
f1K37qLEvm0,1503919,1506799,on the brakes
f1K37qLEvm0,1508640,1515520,nice that was nice
f1K37qLEvm0,1515520,1518159,let's see how we do in this transition
f1K37qLEvm0,1518159,1519520,left to right
f1K37qLEvm0,1519520,1522320,down shift
f1K37qLEvm0,1523410,1525840,[Music]
f1K37qLEvm0,1525840,1528960,nice that really ricey right there was
f1K37qLEvm0,1528960,1530320,really telling
f1K37qLEvm0,1530320,1533440,the chassis was able to go left to right
f1K37qLEvm0,1533440,1536320,is it as flat as i wanted in the corners
f1K37qLEvm0,1536320,1538720,with the overall handling no
f1K37qLEvm0,1538720,1541919,but being able to go left to right so
f1K37qLEvm0,1541919,1544320,quickly and back on throttle
f1K37qLEvm0,1544320,1546240,really showed the work that you're
f1K37qLEvm0,1546240,1547760,getting with the tuning of the
f1K37qLEvm0,1547760,1548640,suspension
f1K37qLEvm0,1548640,1550320,with the chassis set up and everything
f1K37qLEvm0,1550320,1551760,else so that's the really really good
