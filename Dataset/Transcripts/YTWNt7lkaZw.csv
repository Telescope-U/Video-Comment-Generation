YTWNt7lkaZw,80,2320,ah the 90s a simpler time when
YTWNt7lkaZw,2320,4560,playgrounds were wooden and gravy was
YTWNt7lkaZw,4560,6960,clear crystal gravy
YTWNt7lkaZw,6960,9280,you've never seen a gravy like this in
YTWNt7lkaZw,9280,10960,all seriousness the gravy wasn't clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,10960,13200,but the pepsi was as part of a consumer
YTWNt7lkaZw,13200,14960,push for healthier products the clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,14960,17119,craze took off in a big way clear soap
YTWNt7lkaZw,17119,19439,clear game boys and of course clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,19439,22160,pepsi crystal pepsi to be exact a soda
YTWNt7lkaZw,22160,24160,that looked pure like water a product
YTWNt7lkaZw,24160,26240,that would go down in history as one of
YTWNt7lkaZw,26240,28800,the most famous failed products of all
YTWNt7lkaZw,28800,30480,time down there right at the bottom
YTWNt7lkaZw,30480,33040,alongside virtual boy and google glass
YTWNt7lkaZw,33040,35760,but was it actually pepsi's fault see
YTWNt7lkaZw,35760,37440,there's a sinister tale behind the
YTWNt7lkaZw,37440,39600,disappearance of this clear soda a story
YTWNt7lkaZw,39600,42399,of intentional sabotage by coca-cola a
YTWNt7lkaZw,42399,44800,kamikaze mission designed to assassinate
YTWNt7lkaZw,44800,46879,the biggest competitor it's a story that
YTWNt7lkaZw,46879,49600,sounds too crazy to make up a mystery
YTWNt7lkaZw,49600,51600,that is 30 years in the making that we
YTWNt7lkaZw,51600,54160,are gonna solve today did coca-cola
YTWNt7lkaZw,54160,56160,intentionally sabotage their own
YTWNt7lkaZw,56160,57760,products in an effort to take down
YTWNt7lkaZw,57760,62519,crystal pepsi we're gonna find out
YTWNt7lkaZw,65970,73840,[Music]
YTWNt7lkaZw,73840,77040,hello internet welcome to food theory
YTWNt7lkaZw,77040,78720,the show that's less than two years old
YTWNt7lkaZw,78720,81360,but still fondly remembers the 90s based
YTWNt7lkaZw,81360,83200,on the demographics watching the channel
YTWNt7lkaZw,83200,85920,i'm the only one so old also based on
YTWNt7lkaZw,85920,87360,those same demographics more of you
YTWNt7lkaZw,87360,88960,should probably subscribe to the channel
YTWNt7lkaZw,88960,90640,since less than half of you watching
YTWNt7lkaZw,90640,92799,right now have just saying our content
YTWNt7lkaZw,92799,95280,goes down smoother than crystal clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,95280,97280,gravy anyway i know what you're probably
YTWNt7lkaZw,97280,99200,thinking an episode dedicated to crystal
YTWNt7lkaZw,99200,102079,pepsi in the year 2022 seems completely
YTWNt7lkaZw,102079,104479,random totally out of touch but honestly
YTWNt7lkaZw,104479,106240,it's not earlier this year pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,106240,107840,re-released a special edition of their
YTWNt7lkaZw,107840,110079,iconic failure to celebrate its 30-year
YTWNt7lkaZw,110079,113119,anniversary 300 lucky people won a
YTWNt7lkaZw,113119,115439,six-pack of this iconic failed cola
YTWNt7lkaZw,115439,116799,regardless of the taste though the whole
YTWNt7lkaZw,116799,118079,thing got me curious about the history
YTWNt7lkaZw,118079,120640,of crystal pepsi like what went wrong
YTWNt7lkaZw,120640,122880,exactly were people just not interested
YTWNt7lkaZw,122880,125040,in a clear soda or was something else
YTWNt7lkaZw,125040,127119,going on well upon doing the research i
YTWNt7lkaZw,127119,128640,very quickly stumbled across an
YTWNt7lkaZw,128640,130640,onslaught of viral headlines reddit
YTWNt7lkaZw,130640,132560,posts and twitter threads all about how
YTWNt7lkaZw,132560,134800,coca-cola had gone on a suicide mission
YTWNt7lkaZw,134800,136400,to try and take down crystal pepsi no
YTWNt7lkaZw,136400,138080,joke as the story goes they set up one
YTWNt7lkaZw,138080,140000,of their signature sodas tab to get an
YTWNt7lkaZw,140000,142720,intentionally bad tasting clear rebrand
YTWNt7lkaZw,142720,144400,in order to taint the public perception
YTWNt7lkaZw,144400,146640,of all clear beverages from that point
YTWNt7lkaZw,146640,149280,forward taking down not only tab clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,149280,152000,but crystal pepsi in the process but
YTWNt7lkaZw,152000,153959,that couldn't be true right could
YTWNt7lkaZw,153959,155760,self-sabotage like that have really
YTWNt7lkaZw,155760,157760,worked or is this just a food myth that
YTWNt7lkaZw,157760,159920,the internet's made into a fact today we
YTWNt7lkaZw,159920,162080,dig into the murky history behind
YTWNt7lkaZw,162080,164480,crystal pepsi to see what actually
YTWNt7lkaZw,164480,166319,tanked this product was the failure of
YTWNt7lkaZw,166319,168400,crystal pepsi and inevitability or was
YTWNt7lkaZw,168400,170879,it actually the most brilliant 4d chess
YTWNt7lkaZw,170879,173200,move a food company could have ever made
YTWNt7lkaZw,173200,174879,now as i mentioned in the cold open
YTWNt7lkaZw,174879,176640,clear things became a fad in the 90s
YTWNt7lkaZw,176640,178080,because they were actually perceived as
YTWNt7lkaZw,178080,179840,being healthier clearer drink pure
YTWNt7lkaZw,179840,181840,content it's an idea that on the surface
YTWNt7lkaZw,181840,184000,seems absurd after all crystal pepsi has
YTWNt7lkaZw,184000,185760,just as much sugar and calories as its
YTWNt7lkaZw,185760,187599,brown counterparts not like this thing
YTWNt7lkaZw,187599,189599,being clearer actually made it healthier
YTWNt7lkaZw,189599,191519,right but you know for as absurd as the
YTWNt7lkaZw,191519,193440,idea might seem the drink being clear so
YTWNt7lkaZw,193440,195680,it must be more pure is actually kinda
YTWNt7lkaZw,195680,198239,true in crystal pepsi's case this is
YTWNt7lkaZw,198239,199599,basically what pepsi looks like when you
YTWNt7lkaZw,199599,201200,don't add food coloring the brown that
YTWNt7lkaZw,201200,202879,we all associate with cola drinks it's
YTWNt7lkaZw,202879,204319,not the actual color look at the
YTWNt7lkaZw,204319,205599,ingredients for pepsi and you'll see
YTWNt7lkaZw,205599,207440,that it includes caramel color ditto for
YTWNt7lkaZw,207440,209599,coca-cola and those chemicals aren't
YTWNt7lkaZw,209599,211440,always harmless previously coke and
YTWNt7lkaZw,211440,212879,pepsi got their color from a chemical
YTWNt7lkaZw,212879,215200,called 4-methyl limitazole which is as
YTWNt7lkaZw,215200,217680,of 2011 considered to be a carcinogen by
YTWNt7lkaZw,217680,219440,the state of california since nothing is
YTWNt7lkaZw,219440,220879,going to kill your sales worse than
YTWNt7lkaZw,220879,222720,warning this is known to cause cancer in
YTWNt7lkaZw,222720,224480,the state of california they decided to
YTWNt7lkaZw,224480,226319,change the formula so yeah crystal pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,226319,228080,with its lack of food dyes actually had
YTWNt7lkaZw,228080,230720,fewer additives and was in fact a purer
YTWNt7lkaZw,230720,232640,healthier product at least as healthy as
YTWNt7lkaZw,232640,234159,a beverage can be when it's still packed
YTWNt7lkaZw,234159,237920,with 69 grams of sugar nice nice nice
YTWNt7lkaZw,237920,239439,and they weren't the only ones to chase
YTWNt7lkaZw,239439,241200,the clear trend either coors joined the
YTWNt7lkaZw,241200,243360,clear drink fad with zima a clear beer
YTWNt7lkaZw,243360,244799,that achieved the transparent look by
YTWNt7lkaZw,244799,246480,running it through a charcoal filter
YTWNt7lkaZw,246480,247760,unfortunately the process that removed
YTWNt7lkaZw,247760,249439,the color also removed most of the
YTWNt7lkaZw,249439,250959,flavor as culture writer chuck
YTWNt7lkaZw,250959,252879,closterman put it zema was quote the
YTWNt7lkaZw,252879,254640,opposite of an acquired taste not to be
YTWNt7lkaZw,254640,256560,outdone miller brought the world miller
YTWNt7lkaZw,256560,258880,clear beer which unsurprisingly also
YTWNt7lkaZw,258880,260560,wound up to be a big flop but while the
YTWNt7lkaZw,260560,262160,world clearly wasn't ready for clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,262160,264080,tasteless beer they eagerly seemed to
YTWNt7lkaZw,264080,266880,lap up crystal pepsi pepsi invested 40
YTWNt7lkaZw,266880,268720,million dollars in marketing introducing
YTWNt7lkaZw,268720,270160,the world to the clear cola and the
YTWNt7lkaZw,270160,272560,iconic super bowl ad featuring van halen
YTWNt7lkaZw,272560,274240,which might just be the most 90s thing
YTWNt7lkaZw,274240,275210,that you watch all week
YTWNt7lkaZw,275210,278440,[Music]
YTWNt7lkaZw,279040,280720,but apparently that big marketing push
YTWNt7lkaZw,280720,282479,paid off crystal pepsi immediately
YTWNt7lkaZw,282479,284240,captured one percent of the soft drink
YTWNt7lkaZw,284240,285759,market which according to the publisher
YTWNt7lkaZw,285759,287720,of beverage digest was the equivalent of
YTWNt7lkaZw,287720,290800,474 million dollars in retail sales not
YTWNt7lkaZw,290800,292560,too shabby for a brand new drink so
YTWNt7lkaZw,292560,294560,where did it go wrong if sales were so
YTWNt7lkaZw,294560,296720,strong why would it disappear a year
YTWNt7lkaZw,296720,298880,later enter coke the ascent of crystal
YTWNt7lkaZw,298880,301039,pepsi spelled bad news for coca-cola
YTWNt7lkaZw,301039,302400,they were basically left with two
YTWNt7lkaZw,302400,303759,options neither of which were
YTWNt7lkaZw,303759,305440,particularly good they could either
YTWNt7lkaZw,305440,307120,ignore the clear drink trend and let
YTWNt7lkaZw,307120,309039,crystal pepsi dominate the newly created
YTWNt7lkaZw,309039,310960,market for clear cola or they could come
YTWNt7lkaZw,310960,312160,up with a clear version of coke
YTWNt7lkaZw,312160,314240,themselves thereby validating pepsi's
YTWNt7lkaZw,314240,315840,idea and setting themselves up as a
YTWNt7lkaZw,315840,317840,copycat in the public eye either
YTWNt7lkaZw,317840,319680,approach seemed like admitting defeat so
YTWNt7lkaZw,319680,321800,coca-cola went with option three
YTWNt7lkaZw,321800,323759,self-destruct rather than trying to
YTWNt7lkaZw,323759,325440,compete with crystal pepsi and cash in
YTWNt7lkaZw,325440,327360,themselves coca-cola would maliciously
YTWNt7lkaZw,327360,329919,destroy the entire clear drink market if
YTWNt7lkaZw,329919,332160,we can't have a clear soda then no one
YTWNt7lkaZw,332160,334320,can so what was the plan well sergio
YTWNt7lkaZw,334320,335680,zeeman chief marketing officer of
YTWNt7lkaZw,335680,337360,coca-cola planned to release a product
YTWNt7lkaZw,337360,340080,that would fail on purpose tab clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,340080,341919,remember tab no i don't either to be
YTWNt7lkaZw,341919,343759,honest it was coca-cola's first diet
YTWNt7lkaZw,343759,346000,drink marketed to the ladies who wanted
YTWNt7lkaZw,346000,348160,to stay in shape to keep their man
YTWNt7lkaZw,348160,351199,interested keeping your shape in shape
YTWNt7lkaZw,351199,353520,to rewards enjoy tab
YTWNt7lkaZw,353520,356319,and be a mind sticker ah casual sexism
YTWNt7lkaZw,356319,358080,the best way to sell your food product
YTWNt7lkaZw,358080,359919,anyway tab was popular during the 60s
YTWNt7lkaZw,359919,361919,and 70s but by the 90s it was on its way
YTWNt7lkaZw,361919,364160,out thanks to diet coke and here was the
YTWNt7lkaZw,364160,366080,evil genius of coca-cola's plan to
YTWNt7lkaZw,366080,368000,destroy pepsi rather than try to create
YTWNt7lkaZw,368000,369840,a strong competitor to crystal pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,369840,372000,they intentionally created a weak one
YTWNt7lkaZw,372000,373919,they set themselves up to lose on
YTWNt7lkaZw,373919,376080,purpose by releasing the least desirable
YTWNt7lkaZw,376080,378319,version of a clear soda why would they
YTWNt7lkaZw,378319,380319,do such a thing well when coca-cola
YTWNt7lkaZw,380319,382319,released tab clear grocery stores did
YTWNt7lkaZw,382319,383759,the logical thing and placed it right
YTWNt7lkaZw,383759,385840,next to crystal pepsi and as a result
YTWNt7lkaZw,385840,387840,crystal pepsi became associated with tab
YTWNt7lkaZw,387840,389280,clear in the eyes of the public
YTWNt7lkaZw,389280,390880,something that according to sergio
YTWNt7lkaZw,390880,393120,zeeman was intentional quote pepsi was
YTWNt7lkaZw,393120,394960,basically gonna say crystal pepsi was a
YTWNt7lkaZw,394960,397039,mainstream drink it has all this great
YTWNt7lkaZw,397039,399680,taste and we coca-cola said no crystal
YTWNt7lkaZw,399680,401919,pepsi is actually a diet drink even
YTWNt7lkaZw,401919,403520,though it wasn't because tab had the
YTWNt7lkaZw,403520,405680,attributes of diet which was its demise
YTWNt7lkaZw,405680,407360,within three or five months tab clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,407360,409759,was dead and so was crystal pepsi tab
YTWNt7lkaZw,409759,411199,clear was deliberately sent out to
YTWNt7lkaZw,411199,413280,grocery store shelves to die and when it
YTWNt7lkaZw,413280,415520,did it succeeded in taking crystal pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,415520,417360,down with it just like that pepsi's
YTWNt7lkaZw,417360,419039,flashy new product that had been poised
YTWNt7lkaZw,419039,420479,to bring in hundreds of millions of
YTWNt7lkaZw,420479,422479,dollars in revenue per year was doomed
YTWNt7lkaZw,422479,423919,in the words of coca-cola's chief
YTWNt7lkaZw,423919,425440,marketing officer quote we did a
YTWNt7lkaZw,425440,428240,kamikaze on them commit suicide and kill
YTWNt7lkaZw,428240,430880,them in the process the rad new trend of
YTWNt7lkaZw,430880,433440,clear cola was suddenly now nothing but
YTWNt7lkaZw,433440,435599,a joke it's a cool story of underhanded
YTWNt7lkaZw,435599,437440,corporate sabotage of one business's
YTWNt7lkaZw,437440,439039,brilliant maneuvers to try and take down
YTWNt7lkaZw,439039,440960,their competition honestly it is no
YTWNt7lkaZw,440960,442319,surprise that this story would go on to
YTWNt7lkaZw,442319,444160,become a viral hit across the internet
YTWNt7lkaZw,444160,446160,and yet i think it's a lie i think that
YTWNt7lkaZw,446160,448319,this was all just revisionist history
YTWNt7lkaZw,448319,450319,trying to make someone look all galaxy
YTWNt7lkaZw,450319,452319,brain when in truth he was all smooth
YTWNt7lkaZw,452319,454479,brain the entire time i also think it's
YTWNt7lkaZw,454479,455759,a prime example of having to double
YTWNt7lkaZw,455759,456960,check where the information that you're
YTWNt7lkaZw,456960,458960,getting online is coming from first off
YTWNt7lkaZw,458960,460400,it's important to consider the source of
YTWNt7lkaZw,460400,461840,the information this story about
YTWNt7lkaZw,461840,463680,coca-cola's brilliant suicide mission
YTWNt7lkaZw,463680,466240,all comes from one guy sergio zeeman
YTWNt7lkaZw,466240,468240,coca-cola's chief marketing officer it's
YTWNt7lkaZw,468240,469680,true he would know the subject better
YTWNt7lkaZw,469680,471520,than anyone else but he'd also have the
YTWNt7lkaZw,471520,473680,biggest incentive to lie about it since
YTWNt7lkaZw,473680,475039,the story he's telling is basically
YTWNt7lkaZw,475039,476879,trying to spin a failed product into an
YTWNt7lkaZw,476879,478879,intentional act of brilliance and here's
YTWNt7lkaZw,478879,481520,the thing tab clear wouldn't be his only
YTWNt7lkaZw,481520,483120,massive mistake according to fortune
YTWNt7lkaZw,483120,485440,magazine back in the 80s zeeman was also
YTWNt7lkaZw,485440,487039,the executive who pushed to replace
YTWNt7lkaZw,487039,488879,coke's signature flavor you know the
YTWNt7lkaZw,488879,490400,taste that had been the market leader
YTWNt7lkaZw,490400,492960,for the last 98 years with a different
YTWNt7lkaZw,492960,495680,tasting cola flavor called new coke now
YTWNt7lkaZw,495680,496960,considered to be one of the biggest
YTWNt7lkaZw,496960,499199,marketing blunders in history zeeman was
YTWNt7lkaZw,499199,501520,also the mastermind behind fruit topia
YTWNt7lkaZw,501520,503440,another 90s coca-cola product that was
YTWNt7lkaZw,503440,505280,off the shelves less than a decade later
YTWNt7lkaZw,505280,507440,so for him to come in and say hey guys i
YTWNt7lkaZw,507440,509120,know that it seems like i was behind two
YTWNt7lkaZw,509120,510639,of the biggest failed product launches
YTWNt7lkaZw,510639,512800,of all time but that second one totally
YTWNt7lkaZw,512800,514560,on purpose absolutely crossed my heart
YTWNt7lkaZw,514560,516320,hope to die it doesn't necessarily mean
YTWNt7lkaZw,516320,518399,that he's lying but it does mean that we
YTWNt7lkaZw,518399,519919,should probably be skeptical and
YTWNt7lkaZw,519919,522399,skeptical i was so i decided to dig into
YTWNt7lkaZw,522399,524000,the facts around tab clear which is
YTWNt7lkaZw,524000,525600,where things got even more fishy for
YTWNt7lkaZw,525600,527360,example consider the basic timeline
YTWNt7lkaZw,527360,529519,pepsi spent 40 million dollars marketing
YTWNt7lkaZw,529519,531760,crystal pepsi in 1993 but it's
YTWNt7lkaZw,531760,533440,impossible for tab clear to have been
YTWNt7lkaZw,533440,535360,developed as a reaction to the sudden
YTWNt7lkaZw,535360,537279,popularity of the drink considering tab
YTWNt7lkaZw,537279,538880,clear first released in the us in
YTWNt7lkaZw,538880,541279,december of 1992
YTWNt7lkaZw,541279,542800,another part of zeeman's story that
YTWNt7lkaZw,542800,544640,seems suspicious is the idea that he got
YTWNt7lkaZw,544640,546560,the public to associate crystal pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,546560,548560,with bad tasting diet drinks by putting
YTWNt7lkaZw,548560,551120,tab next to it when diet crystal pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,551120,553600,was in fact a very real thing that was
YTWNt7lkaZw,553600,555680,offered right alongside regular crystal
YTWNt7lkaZw,555680,558560,pepsi in the same ads so clearly pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,558560,560000,themselves didn't think that having a
YTWNt7lkaZw,560000,561760,clear diet cola sitting next to crystal
YTWNt7lkaZw,561760,563600,pepsi on the shelf would taint the brand
YTWNt7lkaZw,563600,565760,why would the completely unrelated tab
YTWNt7lkaZw,565760,567440,do it instead here's another part of the
YTWNt7lkaZw,567440,568800,siemens story that doesn't add up the
YTWNt7lkaZw,568800,570320,entire reason that tab clear was sent
YTWNt7lkaZw,570320,571680,out to store shelves was so it could be
YTWNt7lkaZw,571680,573680,placed next to crystal pepsi right but
YTWNt7lkaZw,573680,576240,tab clear was released in japan in march
YTWNt7lkaZw,576240,579360,of 1993 a country where crystal pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,579360,582320,had no presence it makes no sense if you
YTWNt7lkaZw,582320,583839,believe that tab clear was sent out to
YTWNt7lkaZw,583839,585760,sabotage crystal pepsi but that move
YTWNt7lkaZw,585760,587360,makes total sense if you believe the
YTWNt7lkaZw,587360,589360,more obvious conclusion that tab clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,589360,591040,was just another product trying to find
YTWNt7lkaZw,591040,592880,an audience of people who would buy it
YTWNt7lkaZw,592880,594720,in fact the more you look at the actual
YTWNt7lkaZw,594720,596640,history behind tab clear the more it
YTWNt7lkaZw,596640,599200,looks like any other product rollout for
YTWNt7lkaZw,599200,601040,example they initially released tab
YTWNt7lkaZw,601040,602720,clear in 10 test markets before
YTWNt7lkaZw,602720,604320,eventually going wide with it after a
YTWNt7lkaZw,604320,606240,positive reception if the entire purpose
YTWNt7lkaZw,606240,608000,was to launch an intentionally bad
YTWNt7lkaZw,608000,610160,product why bother seeing whether people
YTWNt7lkaZw,610160,611279,liked it why wouldn't you just
YTWNt7lkaZw,611279,612880,immediately ship it out everywhere to
YTWNt7lkaZw,612880,615120,torpedo your competitor head of soviet
YTWNt7lkaZw,615120,617279,forces is served tab clear in very cold
YTWNt7lkaZw,617279,619440,glass which sticks to his lip he
YTWNt7lkaZw,619440,621440,complains of glass frost
YTWNt7lkaZw,621440,625040,his generals hear glasnost
YTWNt7lkaZw,625200,627920,the berlin wall falls sorry tab clear
YTWNt7lkaZw,627920,629680,you weren't responsible for the fall of
YTWNt7lkaZw,629680,631120,the berlin wall and you weren't
YTWNt7lkaZw,631120,632800,responsible for the downfall of crystal
YTWNt7lkaZw,632800,634640,pepsi and hey if the entire reason you
YTWNt7lkaZw,634640,636160,existed was to bring down your
YTWNt7lkaZw,636160,637680,competitor why would you continue to
YTWNt7lkaZw,637680,639760,pour more of your own marketing dollars
YTWNt7lkaZw,639760,643120,into tv advertisements like that in 1994
YTWNt7lkaZw,643120,645120,well after crystal pepsi was in its
YTWNt7lkaZw,645120,646399,decline but you want to know the
YTWNt7lkaZw,646399,647839,evidence point that really seals the
YTWNt7lkaZw,647839,650000,deal look at it the entire point of tab
YTWNt7lkaZw,650000,652240,clear is that it's a clear beverage but
YTWNt7lkaZw,652240,655360,it was only sold in opaque aluminum cans
YTWNt7lkaZw,655360,656800,surely if the goal was for people to
YTWNt7lkaZw,656800,658720,confuse tab clear with crystal pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,658720,660160,they would have at least bothered to
YTWNt7lkaZw,660160,662320,make them look similar yes that's just
YTWNt7lkaZw,662320,663839,the kind of marketing brilliance i'd
YTWNt7lkaZw,663839,665440,expect from a guy who thought that new
YTWNt7lkaZw,665440,668160,coke was a good idea so if it wasn't tab
YTWNt7lkaZw,668160,670079,clear then what did it what tanked
YTWNt7lkaZw,670079,671839,crystal pepsi well earlier i mentioned
YTWNt7lkaZw,671839,673440,that analysts estimated crystal pepsi's
YTWNt7lkaZw,673440,675760,potential annual revenue to be 474
YTWNt7lkaZw,675760,677920,million dollars in retail sales sounds
YTWNt7lkaZw,677920,681120,like a huge number nearly half a billion
YTWNt7lkaZw,681120,683240,but that estimate was also from march of
YTWNt7lkaZw,683240,685440,1993 when the product had only been out
YTWNt7lkaZw,685440,687040,for several months and had just had
YTWNt7lkaZw,687040,689279,itself a massive super bowl push that
YTWNt7lkaZw,689279,691120,turned out to be its best selling months
YTWNt7lkaZw,691120,692800,turns out crystal pepsi's market share
YTWNt7lkaZw,692800,694800,declined to half of its previous levels
YTWNt7lkaZw,694800,697360,by the end of 1993. people were willing
YTWNt7lkaZw,697360,698959,to give the product a try they just
YTWNt7lkaZw,698959,700160,didn't like it and they didn't stick
YTWNt7lkaZw,700160,702399,around and you see that's the real truth
YTWNt7lkaZw,702399,704640,here yum brand's chairman david c novak
YTWNt7lkaZw,704640,706399,is credited with introducing the crystal
YTWNt7lkaZw,706399,708320,pepsi concept and in an interview with
YTWNt7lkaZw,708320,710399,fast company he said this quote i still
YTWNt7lkaZw,710399,712639,think it's the best idea i ever had and
YTWNt7lkaZw,712639,714800,the worst executed people were saying we
YTWNt7lkaZw,714800,716160,should stop and address some issues
YTWNt7lkaZw,716160,717839,along the way and they were right it
YTWNt7lkaZw,717839,719200,would have been nice if i'd made sure
YTWNt7lkaZw,719200,721440,the product tasted good end quote you
YTWNt7lkaZw,721440,723600,see that's just it it tasted bad at best
YTWNt7lkaZw,723600,725519,it was passable but also weird because
YTWNt7lkaZw,725519,727680,it was clear watch any online review of
YTWNt7lkaZw,727680,729680,crystal pepsi and that's exactly the
YTWNt7lkaZw,729680,731600,sentiment that you see tastes like pepsi
YTWNt7lkaZw,731600,734240,with an aftertaste of modeling clay it
YTWNt7lkaZw,734240,736320,started at pepsi and then went blush i
YTWNt7lkaZw,736320,738880,don't remember crystal pepsi tasting
YTWNt7lkaZw,738880,740959,anything like cola i don't think it
YTWNt7lkaZw,740959,743120,tastes like pepsi it was the only thing
YTWNt7lkaZw,743120,744959,available and i was really thirsty i
YTWNt7lkaZw,744959,746880,would drink crystal clear pepsi again
YTWNt7lkaZw,746880,749279,but i wouldn't go out and buy it it's
YTWNt7lkaZw,749279,751120,messing with my brain i don't know my
YTWNt7lkaZw,751120,753279,eyes and my taste buds like
YTWNt7lkaZw,753279,755440,are not connecting on this yeah it like
YTWNt7lkaZw,755440,757839,tastes like cola candy smell don't
YTWNt7lkaZw,757839,759839,believe the headlines my friends in the
YTWNt7lkaZw,759839,762160,end the only thing that killed crystal
YTWNt7lkaZw,762160,764720,pepsi was crystal pepsi itself sorry
YTWNt7lkaZw,764720,766480,coca-cola marketing guy you have enough
YTWNt7lkaZw,766480,768079,failures to your name you don't get to
YTWNt7lkaZw,768079,771440,claim this one too but hey that's just a
YTWNt7lkaZw,771440,777480,theory a food theory bottoms up
