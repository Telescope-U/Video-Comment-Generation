sdiDslg4oSY,8639,10559,the indie horror scene and took youtube
sdiDslg4oSY,10559,13040,by storm felt like everybody was playing

sdiDslg4oSY,29679,31039,the last month i've been digging through
sdiDslg4oSY,31039,33360,the trailer the merch drops the secret

sdiDslg4oSY,35520,37680,all to come up with the answers and
sdiDslg4oSY,37680,39440,regardless of whether i'm right or wrong

sdiDslg4oSY,58559,60640,high five that subscribe button and
sdiDslg4oSY,60640,62800,welcome back friends to poppy playtime
sdiDslg4oSY,62800,65040,the one game to finally understand how
sdiDslg4oSY,65040,67520,terrifying old toys really are didn't
sdiDslg4oSY,67520,69200,really need a creepy indie horror game
sdiDslg4oSY,69200,71040,to tell me that all those american girl
sdiDslg4oSY,71040,72799,dolls secretly come to life at night
sdiDslg4oSY,72799,75119,kirsten's unblinking eyes just pierce
sdiDslg4oSY,75119,78159,into my soul ah it's too realistic hard
sdiDslg4oSY,78159,80159,pass last time we explored the old
sdiDslg4oSY,80159,82320,abandoned toy factory of playtime co we
sdiDslg4oSY,82320,84159,walked away with two major predictions
sdiDslg4oSY,84159,85759,about where this franchise is headed
sdiDslg4oSY,85759,87040,first we concluded that some of the
sdiDslg4oSY,87040,89040,former employees were experimented on in
sdiDslg4oSY,89040,91759,order to create living toys and not just
sdiDslg4oSY,91759,94000,experimented on but that their flesh and
sdiDslg4oSY,94000,96000,organs were actively used as the
sdiDslg4oSY,96000,98240,materials to create parts of the toys
sdiDslg4oSY,98240,100000,some were willing participants in this
sdiDslg4oSY,100000,102320,namely stella graber who i believe is
sdiDslg4oSY,102320,104240,now the creepy living doll poppy
sdiDslg4oSY,104240,106960,playtime others were
sdiDslg4oSY,106960,109200,less enthusiastic about the process and
sdiDslg4oSY,109200,111439,as a result the ensuing toy was just a
sdiDslg4oSY,111439,113439,wee bit less friendly my second major
sdiDslg4oSY,113439,115040,prediction was that our game's title
sdiDslg4oSY,115040,117600,character poppy playtime wasn't actually
sdiDslg4oSY,117600,119920,the villain of the story unlike every
sdiDslg4oSY,119920,122399,other horror game in existence where the
sdiDslg4oSY,122399,124399,title character is always out to rip the
sdiDslg4oSY,124399,126560,flesh from your bones instead here in
sdiDslg4oSY,126560,128399,poppy playtime stella's human desire to
sdiDslg4oSY,128399,130080,make children happy and live forever
sdiDslg4oSY,130080,132480,meant that now reborn as a toy she just
sdiDslg4oSY,132480,134480,wanted to escape the factory to fulfill
sdiDslg4oSY,134480,136400,those dreams because of this i guess
sdiDslg4oSY,136400,137520,that she would serve as our guide
sdiDslg4oSY,137520,138879,throughout the facility as we tried to
sdiDslg4oSY,138879,140400,solve the mystery of the factory's
sdiDslg4oSY,140400,142160,missing employees and hey if you listen
sdiDslg4oSY,142160,144319,to the chapter 2 trailer it seems like
sdiDslg4oSY,144319,146959,we weren't that far off terrible things
sdiDslg4oSY,146959,149920,have happened where do i even begin
sdiDslg4oSY,149920,153120,you're in grave danger she's watching
sdiDslg4oSY,153120,154959,your every move
sdiDslg4oSY,154959,156860,so you better be careful
sdiDslg4oSY,156860,159519,[Music]
sdiDslg4oSY,159519,162640,mommy doesn't like guests that's poppy's
sdiDslg4oSY,162640,164480,voice definitely warning us of what's
sdiDslg4oSY,164480,166239,ahead so i'm gonna personally consider
sdiDslg4oSY,166239,168560,this one a win look i just gotta take
sdiDslg4oSY,168560,170319,what wins i can okay they're they're few
sdiDslg4oSY,170319,172080,and far between so now that we've proven
sdiDslg4oSY,172080,174000,ourselves to be very clearly dialed into
sdiDslg4oSY,174000,175680,the storyline for poppy playtime what do
sdiDslg4oSY,175680,176959,we think's coming down the pipeline for
sdiDslg4oSY,176959,178720,chapter two let's just say that mommy
sdiDslg4oSY,178720,180800,longlegs here is gonna be looking much
sdiDslg4oSY,180800,182800,different by the end of this chapter but
sdiDslg4oSY,182800,184480,to understand how we're gonna have to
sdiDslg4oSY,184480,186720,look a bit closer since she was the big
sdiDslg4oSY,186720,188560,reveal of the trailer i think it's fair
sdiDslg4oSY,188560,190080,to start there first and most
sdiDslg4oSY,190080,192560,importantly yes her name is officially
sdiDslg4oSY,192560,194480,mommy longlegs i'm not even making that
sdiDslg4oSY,194480,196239,up to ride whatever weird trend gaming
sdiDslg4oSY,196239,198080,is having right now with large deadly
sdiDslg4oSY,198080,200080,women this official name was actually
sdiDslg4oSY,200080,202560,revealed in and i i can't believe i'm
sdiDslg4oSY,202560,204000,gonna have to say this but it was
sdiDslg4oSY,204000,206480,revealed in the nfts that this game
sdiDslg4oSY,206480,208799,released feel dirty just saying it
sdiDslg4oSY,208799,211120,here's the thing mob games creators of
sdiDslg4oSY,211120,212640,poppy playtime yeah they made these
sdiDslg4oSY,212640,214480,things and they hid lore behind them
sdiDslg4oSY,214480,217519,which is totally not cool the only
sdiDslg4oSY,217519,219200,reason i'm comfortable talking about
sdiDslg4oSY,219200,221040,these things is because the fan backlash
sdiDslg4oSY,221040,223519,was so strong against it and they sold
sdiDslg4oSY,223519,226319,so poorly seriously they made like 30
sdiDslg4oSY,226319,227840,000 of these things and they only sold
sdiDslg4oSY,227840,230239,like 600. that mob games learned their
sdiDslg4oSY,230239,231760,lesson and they've gone on record saying
sdiDslg4oSY,231760,233599,that they are not going to do nfts again
sdiDslg4oSY,233599,234319,so
sdiDslg4oSY,234319,236000,we're watching you i'm gonna hold you to
sdiDslg4oSY,236000,238239,that anyway in a completely awesome move
sdiDslg4oSY,238239,240480,the channel terraco bought one of each
sdiDslg4oSY,240480,242159,so that no one else had to and shared
sdiDslg4oSY,242159,243920,them all on his channel so everyone
sdiDslg4oSY,243920,245519,could see what they were missing and it
sdiDslg4oSY,245519,247760,did give us important lore information
sdiDslg4oSY,247760,249439,on the front of each card was a playtime
sdiDslg4oSY,249439,250959,company toy and on the back was a
sdiDslg4oSY,250959,252959,corresponding date which allows us to
sdiDslg4oSY,252959,254720,form a complete timeline of the toy's
sdiDslg4oSY,254720,257040,releases by playtime co poppy playtime
sdiDslg4oSY,257040,259120,was the first released in 1950 braun the
sdiDslg4oSY,259120,261759,dinosaur was next in 1961 followed by
sdiDslg4oSY,261759,264720,candy cat in 1979 huggy wuggy and kissy
sdiDslg4oSY,264720,267520,missy were respected in 1984 and 1985
sdiDslg4oSY,267520,269360,and finally boogie bot was the most
sdiDslg4oSY,269360,272960,recent in 1993 this timeline actually
sdiDslg4oSY,272960,275040,reinforces our previous theory probably
sdiDslg4oSY,275040,276800,the only thing to ever come out of nfts
sdiDslg4oSY,276800,278240,where we guessed that poppy was the
sdiDslg4oSY,278240,280000,first major hit for playtime co because
sdiDslg4oSY,280000,281759,of how eager stella was to be turned
sdiDslg4oSY,281759,283919,into a toy but that at some point the
sdiDslg4oSY,283919,286240,company lost the secret to her creation
sdiDslg4oSY,286240,288560,which is why every toy that follows her
sdiDslg4oSY,288560,290560,becomes a monster in addition to forming
sdiDslg4oSY,290560,292400,a timeline though the nfts also ended
sdiDslg4oSY,292400,296080,with voice lines reading out letters
sdiDslg4oSY,296080,298080,with the last of the batch giving us a
sdiDslg4oSY,298080,300000,code that we'd need to solve
sdiDslg4oSY,300000,300880,y
sdiDslg4oSY,300880,304000,m n l i o
sdiDslg4oSY,304000,304720,s
sdiDslg4oSY,304720,305520,o
sdiDslg4oSY,305520,307360,m l o
sdiDslg4oSY,307360,310638,m g e
sdiDslg4oSY,314080,315440,assembling all the letters and
sdiDslg4oSY,315440,317199,unscrambling them you get the phrase
sdiDslg4oSY,317199,320639,mommy longlegs is coming yeah
sdiDslg4oSY,320639,323039,definitely not a puzzle worth the 90
sdiDslg4oSY,323039,325120,dollars it takes to assemble all the
sdiDslg4oSY,325120,327840,nfts again huge shout out to terraco as
sdiDslg4oSY,327840,329440,well as all the other creators who i saw
sdiDslg4oSY,329440,331360,do something similar with these nfts and
sdiDslg4oSY,331360,332880,made them available to the public okay
sdiDslg4oSY,332880,334800,so mommy longlegs is clearly our next
sdiDslg4oSY,334800,337120,big bad a giant spider with stretchy
sdiDslg4oSY,337120,339759,legs but what exactly is their plan well
sdiDslg4oSY,339759,341280,let's think back to chapter one in
sdiDslg4oSY,341280,342720,chapter one we learned that there's been
sdiDslg4oSY,342720,344560,a series of experiments to create these
sdiDslg4oSY,344560,347039,monsters coordination and cooperation is
sdiDslg4oSY,347039,348880,evidently within his skill set as well
sdiDslg4oSY,348880,350160,as the skill set of all other
sdiDslg4oSY,350160,352240,experiments of his type huggy wuggy was
sdiDslg4oSY,352240,355840,the last experiment 1006 but he was also
sdiDslg4oSY,355840,357759,different as we saw in the game's first
sdiDslg4oSY,357759,359600,trailer in a split second lore reveal
sdiDslg4oSY,359600,361759,huggy didn't need to eat in order to
sdiDslg4oSY,361759,363759,survive quote from the trailer despite
sdiDslg4oSY,363759,366080,his digestive tract being wired properly
sdiDslg4oSY,366080,368160,the prototype finds no necessity for
sdiDslg4oSY,368160,370720,sustenance unlike the others all other
sdiDslg4oSY,370720,372319,experiments can only survive while
sdiDslg4oSY,372319,374960,subsisting on much larger portions and
sdiDslg4oSY,374960,376319,in this new chapter it looks like we're
sdiDslg4oSY,376319,378080,gonna see these previous five versions
sdiDslg4oSY,378080,379600,of huggy here we see ourselves having to
sdiDslg4oSY,379600,380880,play whack-a-mole against three
sdiDslg4oSY,380880,382319,differently colored huggies trying to
sdiDslg4oSY,382319,384080,crawl out of the pipes seeing how many
sdiDslg4oSY,384080,385680,empty pipes are here when surprised me
sdiDslg4oSY,385680,388080,to see two more variations crawling out
sdiDslg4oSY,388080,389360,and just like we heard about in the
sdiDslg4oSY,389360,391600,tapes these guys probably hungry
sdiDslg4oSY,391600,393199,considering that all the employees of
sdiDslg4oSY,393199,395120,the factory went missing 10 years ago
sdiDslg4oSY,395120,396800,that is a long time to be waiting for a
sdiDslg4oSY,396800,399280,full meal mommy longlegs is also going
sdiDslg4oSY,399280,400880,to want some food when she sees us in
sdiDslg4oSY,400880,404720,the trailer she says a new playmate it's
sdiDslg4oSY,404720,406400,been so
sdiDslg4oSY,406400,408960,long notice the slight head twitch the
sdiDslg4oSY,408960,411039,change in her voice as she tells us it's
sdiDslg4oSY,411039,414000,been so long yeah she seems unhinged and
sdiDslg4oSY,414000,415680,hungry she's just hoping that we are
sdiDslg4oSY,415680,418160,quite literally a fly in a web just like
sdiDslg4oSY,418160,419919,the chapter's title says but if these
sdiDslg4oSY,419919,422240,creatures need food and lots of it in
sdiDslg4oSY,422240,424160,order to survive then how are they all
sdiDslg4oSY,424160,426000,going after a decade without any
sdiDslg4oSY,426000,427759,visitors well for that answer we
sdiDslg4oSY,427759,429840,actually turned to leaked closed circuit
sdiDslg4oSY,429840,431520,tv footage that was revealed as part of
sdiDslg4oSY,431520,433919,a past poppy playtime merch drop because
sdiDslg4oSY,433919,435599,let's face it once you've had yourself a
sdiDslg4oSY,435599,437599,wildly successful 30 minute gameplay
sdiDslg4oSY,437599,439599,demo for your horror concepts not about
sdiDslg4oSY,439599,441280,winning over the audience's trust by
sdiDslg4oSY,441280,442960,getting a fully fleshed out mechanically
sdiDslg4oSY,442960,444639,sound chapter 2 out right away it's
sdiDslg4oSY,444639,448240,about franchising opportunities fam nfts
sdiDslg4oSY,448240,450400,merch plushies man i'm just impressed
sdiDslg4oSY,450400,451440,that they showed enough restraint to
sdiDslg4oSY,451440,453280,work on the actual game long enough
sdiDslg4oSY,453280,454960,before the publication of their first
sdiDslg4oSY,454960,456880,novel trilogy anyway when this merch
sdiDslg4oSY,456880,458639,website went live it came with three
sdiDslg4oSY,458639,460960,different cctv camera feeds from inside
sdiDslg4oSY,460960,462800,the factory we can tell that this is a
sdiDslg4oSY,462800,464639,live feed because camera01 is in the
sdiDslg4oSY,464639,466479,main auditorium where we first see huggy
sdiDslg4oSY,466479,468800,but huggy is noticeably missing so these
sdiDslg4oSY,468800,471039,feeds are clearly leaking after he tried
sdiDslg4oSY,471039,472879,to maul us to death in the vent system
sdiDslg4oSY,472879,474560,in the beginning these camera feeds were
sdiDslg4oSY,474560,476160,just kind of there nothing all that
sdiDslg4oSY,476160,478240,exciting but after 10 days things
sdiDslg4oSY,478240,480960,started to happen on camera01 a broken
sdiDslg4oSY,480960,482639,and bloody catbeat toy appeared in the
sdiDslg4oSY,482639,484479,middle of the room the blood isn't super
sdiDslg4oSY,484479,486240,surprising given the whole people or
sdiDslg4oSY,486240,487680,toys thing that we already talked about
sdiDslg4oSY,487680,489360,bloody toys were strewn across the
sdiDslg4oSY,489360,491360,factory in chapter one the interesting
sdiDslg4oSY,491360,493039,part is actually what happens next
sdiDslg4oSY,493039,494960,another three days go by and suddenly
sdiDslg4oSY,494960,496800,the catbeat toy is missing with a trail
sdiDslg4oSY,496800,498400,of blood leading out into the darkness
sdiDslg4oSY,498400,500400,around the same time we see this image
sdiDslg4oSY,500400,501840,of a spaghetti hand coming out of the
sdiDslg4oSY,501840,503919,machinery these details plus the fact
sdiDslg4oSY,503919,505840,that we see mommy longlegs drag a huggy
sdiDslg4oSY,505840,507280,wuggy doll into the darkness at the
sdiDslg4oSY,507280,509120,start of the chapter 2 trailer tells me
sdiDslg4oSY,509120,511520,that the larger monsters are feeding off
sdiDslg4oSY,511520,513919,of the other toys remember some or maybe
sdiDslg4oSY,513919,515839,even all of the toys are made from
sdiDslg4oSY,515839,517599,people that's why they leave behind
sdiDslg4oSY,517599,519360,pools of blood when they're injured as
sdiDslg4oSY,519360,521440,such it can all serve as healthy snacks
sdiDslg4oSY,521440,523680,to keep mama alive in fact we actually
sdiDslg4oSY,523680,525440,see pieces of brawn and boogie bot
sdiDslg4oSY,525440,527120,hanging from the webs around the factory
sdiDslg4oSY,527120,529040,much like flies trapped in a web about
sdiDslg4oSY,529040,530959,to be eaten by the spider we also see
sdiDslg4oSY,530959,532560,this caterpillar enemy chasing us
sdiDslg4oSY,532560,534080,through a jungle gym setup wouldn't be
sdiDslg4oSY,534080,536480,surprised if mommy winds up devouring
sdiDslg4oSY,536480,538560,that thing too like a spider eating an
sdiDslg4oSY,538560,540800,insect all of that just tiding her over
sdiDslg4oSY,540800,542480,until she can finally get herself a
sdiDslg4oSY,542480,544720,proper meal us but for all the spider
sdiDslg4oSY,544720,546800,imagery there's one weird detail mommy
sdiDslg4oSY,546800,549760,longlegs only has four legs i mean even
sdiDslg4oSY,549760,553600,my favorite pizza plex spider music man
sdiDslg4oSY,553600,555920,he had six but i think that her four
sdiDslg4oSY,555920,557680,legs act as a clue for what's gonna
sdiDslg4oSY,557680,559120,happen to her throughout the chapter
sdiDslg4oSY,559120,561200,mommy longlegs was clearly inspired by
sdiDslg4oSY,561200,563360,the real world toy of betty spaghetti a
sdiDslg4oSY,563360,565200,toy that was huge during the late 90s
sdiDslg4oSY,565200,567600,and early 2000s she too had rubber limbs
sdiDslg4oSY,567600,569120,and hair that you can manipulate but the
sdiDslg4oSY,569120,571120,key part was that she was customizable
sdiDslg4oSY,571120,572160,and i don't mean that you could just
sdiDslg4oSY,572160,574000,style her hair her body parts and hair
sdiDslg4oSY,574000,576160,were actually removable and swappable
sdiDslg4oSY,576160,577600,for instance her ponytail could be
sdiDslg4oSY,577600,579760,swapped out for slinkies or yarn and of
sdiDslg4oSY,579760,581120,course you could accessorize to your
sdiDslg4oSY,581120,583279,heart's content if mommy is taking these
sdiDslg4oSY,583279,585200,broken toys and eating their organic
sdiDslg4oSY,585200,587519,insides maybe she's also collecting the
sdiDslg4oSY,587519,589760,fabric and plastic bodies to create more
sdiDslg4oSY,589760,592080,limbs that'll make her stronger add to
sdiDslg4oSY,592080,594080,her arm count in fact in the trailer
sdiDslg4oSY,594080,595760,there's a small detail that i bet most
sdiDslg4oSY,595760,597760,people overlooked there are these small
sdiDslg4oSY,597760,600480,little dots on mommy longlegs's arms and
sdiDslg4oSY,600480,602720,neck as she crawls towards us it's not a
sdiDslg4oSY,602720,605200,rendering or modeling issue that is just
sdiDslg4oSY,605200,607200,like the dots that we see on the betty
sdiDslg4oSY,607200,609360,spaghetti dolls dots that help with the
sdiDslg4oSY,609360,611680,toys customization in short if you think
sdiDslg4oSY,611680,613680,that mommy is threatening now just wait
sdiDslg4oSY,613680,615680,until she puts on the rest of her arms
sdiDslg4oSY,615680,617279,and starts filling out those holes with
sdiDslg4oSY,617279,619440,equippable accessories like a boogie bot
sdiDslg4oSY,619440,621600,head that's ready to cave your skull in
sdiDslg4oSY,621600,622959,other things to point out here from the
sdiDslg4oSY,622959,624959,trailer obviously the caterpillar like i
sdiDslg4oSY,624959,626399,mentioned there also seems to be a
sdiDslg4oSY,626399,628399,flower enemy hidden up in the ceiling
sdiDslg4oSY,628399,630079,the huggy we see mommy grab at the
sdiDslg4oSY,630079,631839,beginning of the trailer isn't the huggy
sdiDslg4oSY,631839,633600,that chased us from chapter one you'll
sdiDslg4oSY,633600,635200,notice there's no blood on the floor and
sdiDslg4oSY,635200,637040,it's small size relative to the size of
sdiDslg4oSY,637040,638959,the floor tiles so this thing is likely
sdiDslg4oSY,638959,640720,a random huggy doll that's used for
sdiDslg4oSY,640720,642480,effect but before we wrap things up here
sdiDslg4oSY,642480,643680,there's still one more topic that i
sdiDslg4oSY,643680,645040,wanted to focus on today and it's the
sdiDslg4oSY,645040,646480,character that we actually started this
sdiDslg4oSY,646480,648399,whole theory off with poppy while the
sdiDslg4oSY,648399,649920,internet's been distracted with mommy
sdiDslg4oSY,649920,651839,longlegs poppy is still here and she's
sdiDslg4oSY,651839,653279,talking to us throughout the entire
sdiDslg4oSY,653279,655519,trailer and what she's saying or more
sdiDslg4oSY,655519,657760,importantly what she's not saying may
sdiDslg4oSY,657760,659760,actually be pointing us to the main plot
sdiDslg4oSY,659760,662480,of not only this chapter but the entire
sdiDslg4oSY,662480,664399,game as i pointed out earlier poppy
sdiDslg4oSY,664399,665600,seems to be guiding us throughout the
sdiDslg4oSY,665600,667360,game but just because she's helping us
sdiDslg4oSY,667360,669200,doesn't mean she's actually the good guy
sdiDslg4oSY,669200,670640,take a listen to these two lines from
sdiDslg4oSY,670640,672839,the trailer you are
sdiDslg4oSY,672839,676800,perfect too perfect to lose poppy saying
sdiDslg4oSY,676800,678959,we're too perfect to lose lines up with
sdiDslg4oSY,678959,680640,what we theorized about last time that
sdiDslg4oSY,680640,682399,she's the one talking to us throughout
sdiDslg4oSY,682399,684079,the death screens it's not your time to
sdiDslg4oSY,684079,686560,die don't die just yet it's too early to
sdiDslg4oSY,686560,688480,die all these screens show us that poppy
sdiDslg4oSY,688480,690480,wants us alive but her reason for that
sdiDslg4oSY,690480,692320,seems unclear sure throughout chapter
sdiDslg4oSY,692320,694240,one we got notes and death screens that
sdiDslg4oSY,694240,695519,seem to be focused on us saving the
sdiDslg4oSY,695519,697680,missing employees there's more lives at
sdiDslg4oSY,697680,699360,risk than just yours and all that but in
sdiDslg4oSY,699360,701040,this new trailer there's something
sdiDslg4oSY,701040,703200,uneasy about poppy's tone something
sdiDslg4oSY,703200,705200,obsessive it's like she's planning
sdiDslg4oSY,705200,706800,something that we aren't aware of we
sdiDslg4oSY,706800,708320,theorized last time that all poppy
sdiDslg4oSY,708320,709920,wanted was to be free out in the real
sdiDslg4oSY,709920,711920,world to bring joy to children but what
sdiDslg4oSY,711920,713680,if we were only half right just because
sdiDslg4oSY,713680,715120,she wants to bring joy to children
sdiDslg4oSY,715120,716880,doesn't technically mean that she has to
sdiDslg4oSY,716880,719200,leave the factory what if poppy is
sdiDslg4oSY,719200,721760,trying to bring the factory back to life
sdiDslg4oSY,721760,723040,at the very beginning of the game we get
sdiDslg4oSY,723040,724800,a note telling us to come to the factory
sdiDslg4oSY,724800,726720,and find a poppy flower but after
sdiDslg4oSY,726720,728480,finding the flower all the literal
sdiDslg4oSY,728480,730480,writing on the wall tells us to not go
sdiDslg4oSY,730480,732320,in why would we get a letter from the
sdiDslg4oSY,732320,734240,employees telling us to find the flower
sdiDslg4oSY,734240,736240,only for them to then tell us to stay
sdiDslg4oSY,736240,738000,away once we actually get there it
sdiDslg4oSY,738000,740800,doesn't make sense it only makes sense
sdiDslg4oSY,740800,743040,if that first letter is from poppy
sdiDslg4oSY,743040,744560,notice those spelling and grammar
sdiDslg4oSY,744560,747040,mistakes that letter is from her it was
sdiDslg4oSY,747040,749760,sent to us to lure us in she wants us in
sdiDslg4oSY,749760,752160,this factory she needs us in this
sdiDslg4oSY,752160,753920,factory listen again to our lines from
sdiDslg4oSY,753920,757920,the trailer you are perfect too perfect
sdiDslg4oSY,757920,761200,to lose she describes us as perfect in
sdiDslg4oSY,761200,762959,the death screens of chapter one she
sdiDslg4oSY,762959,765279,calls huggy wonderful he's good but he's
sdiDslg4oSY,765279,767279,not perfect poppy must therefore be
sdiDslg4oSY,767279,768959,aware that both huggy wuggy and mommy
sdiDslg4oSY,768959,770560,longlegs are the failed attempts to
sdiDslg4oSY,770560,773200,recreate the magic of her own birth but
sdiDslg4oSY,773200,774800,someone who came back to the factory
sdiDslg4oSY,774800,776800,despite the horror stories someone who
sdiDslg4oSY,776800,778399,came back with a good heart that wanted
sdiDslg4oSY,778399,780639,to help those who were trapped that is
sdiDslg4oSY,780639,782560,suddenly someone that she can work with
sdiDslg4oSY,782560,784079,as far as we know poppy is the only
sdiDslg4oSY,784079,786160,experiment to truly work the only toy
sdiDslg4oSY,786160,788000,that managed to not turn into a monster
sdiDslg4oSY,788000,789680,through the toy conversion process and
sdiDslg4oSY,789680,791519,if she truly wants to spread joy to all
sdiDslg4oSY,791519,792880,the children of the world it would make
sdiDslg4oSY,792880,794720,sense for her to want to restart those
sdiDslg4oSY,794720,797120,experiments to turn the factory back on
sdiDslg4oSY,797120,800079,to create more living toys like herself
sdiDslg4oSY,800079,802320,but it all needs to start with one pure
sdiDslg4oSY,802320,805279,soul it needs to start with us that's
sdiDslg4oSY,805279,807360,why she doesn't want to lose us not just
sdiDslg4oSY,807360,808880,because we can free her and remove the
sdiDslg4oSY,808880,810240,obstacles standing in her way but
sdiDslg4oSY,810240,812480,because in her eyes we can become the
sdiDslg4oSY,812480,815600,new patient zero we can be the ken to
sdiDslg4oSY,815600,817839,her barbie my guess is that after
sdiDslg4oSY,817839,820079,surviving chapter after chapter of toy
sdiDslg4oSY,820079,822560,related horror headed our way in the end
sdiDslg4oSY,822560,824800,poppy is gonna turn on us she's gonna
sdiDslg4oSY,824800,826800,betray us she's gonna turn us into the
sdiDslg4oSY,826800,829120,next generation of toy by winning the
sdiDslg4oSY,829120,832560,game we ultimately lose but hey while
