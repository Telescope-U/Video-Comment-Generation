Fg1oKKz7NOw,113520,116079,talking about the power glove and how
Fg1oKKz7NOw,116079,117920,the idea of controlling the game with
Fg1oKKz7NOw,117920,120640,physical movement and game sensors was
Fg1oKKz7NOw,120640,121920,something that
Fg1oKKz7NOw,121920,124000,didn't really work out now you're
Fg1oKKz7NOw,124000,126560,playing with power
Fg1oKKz7NOw,126560,128720,now you're playing with [ __ ] [ __ ]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,128720,130399,well the wii remote was a big
Fg1oKKz7NOw,130399,132239,improvement over the power glove but it
Fg1oKKz7NOw,132239,133760,definitely had its
Fg1oKKz7NOw,133760,136480,not so great moments check out party
Fg1oKKz7NOw,136480,139280,babies yeah these babies are here to
Fg1oKKz7NOw,139280,140900,party
Fg1oKKz7NOw,140900,143959,[Music]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,144000,146160,it takes place in a nursery with a bunch
Fg1oKKz7NOw,146160,149520,of baby party games now tell me can you
Fg1oKKz7NOw,149520,151519,imagine a nursery where they call the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,151519,154480,kids baby one baby two and so on that's
Fg1oKKz7NOw,154480,156800,some shitty nursery they don't even take
Fg1oKKz7NOw,156800,159280,the time to remember the kids names not
Fg1oKKz7NOw,159280,161120,to mention what's with the big scary
Fg1oKKz7NOw,161120,163599,monkey face is this a nursery or some
Fg1oKKz7NOw,163599,165840,kind of demented funhouse so i'm the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,165840,167599,baby on the left
Fg1oKKz7NOw,167599,169599,falling on my ass even with the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,169599,171599,instructions i still can't get the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,171599,173280,controls down
Fg1oKKz7NOw,173280,174560,yeah that's how the wii is it's all
Fg1oKKz7NOw,174560,175920,about inventing different kinds of
Fg1oKKz7NOw,175920,177599,motions like you might have to move it
Fg1oKKz7NOw,177599,182000,like this or like this or like this
Fg1oKKz7NOw,182000,184239,and as soon as you figure it out it's on
Fg1oKKz7NOw,184239,185840,to the next mini game and now it's all
Fg1oKKz7NOw,185840,186879,different
Fg1oKKz7NOw,186879,188560,give me a chance
Fg1oKKz7NOw,188560,190720,like this race here what you have to do
Fg1oKKz7NOw,190720,193200,is hold the remote horizontally and tilt
Fg1oKKz7NOw,193200,195440,it left and right really fast does that
Fg1oKKz7NOw,195440,197599,sound like fun it isn't
Fg1oKKz7NOw,197599,199519,well i almost made it to the next part
Fg1oKKz7NOw,199519,201120,but then the rest of the babies all jump
Fg1oKKz7NOw,201120,203280,on these little bouncy animal things and
Fg1oKKz7NOw,203280,205519,they leave me in the dust the game won't
Fg1oKKz7NOw,205519,208239,let me move anymore stop me dead in my
Fg1oKKz7NOw,208239,210480,tracks and now i gotta sit here and
Fg1oKKz7NOw,210480,212959,watch the rest of the race come on you
Fg1oKKz7NOw,212959,215599,can't leave a baby behind that's brutal
Fg1oKKz7NOw,215599,218319,and when they lap me i'm gone
Fg1oKKz7NOw,218319,220400,what happened to the baby that's [ __ ]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,220400,222959,up man
Fg1oKKz7NOw,223360,224720,and anyone who wants to tell me this
Fg1oKKz7NOw,224720,226640,game is easy would only be admitting
Fg1oKKz7NOw,226640,229360,they're good at party babies
Fg1oKKz7NOw,229360,231360,then there's balls of fury based on the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,231360,233680,ping-pong comedy with christopher walken
Fg1oKKz7NOw,233680,235680,so you just swing the wii remote around
Fg1oKKz7NOw,235680,237920,like an idiot and try to pull off crazy
Fg1oKKz7NOw,237920,240159,moves there's not much to say about this
Fg1oKKz7NOw,240159,242480,game other than just the fact that it
Fg1oKKz7NOw,242480,244799,exists then there's monkey mischief
Fg1oKKz7NOw,244799,247360,where you steal stakes from lions
Fg1oKKz7NOw,247360,250400,yeah somebody had to think of that
Fg1oKKz7NOw,250400,255720,monkeys stealing stakes from lions
Fg1oKKz7NOw,259040,261280,then there's billy the wizard
Fg1oKKz7NOw,261280,263360,oh man but you think it's a rip-off of
Fg1oKKz7NOw,263360,265680,harry potter huh just you wait it's a
Fg1oKKz7NOw,265680,268400,rip-off of superman 64.
Fg1oKKz7NOw,268400,271120,all you do is fly through rings i mean
Fg1oKKz7NOw,271120,274320,sorry they're hoops not rings all i do
Fg1oKKz7NOw,274320,276800,is run into walls and try to make giant
Fg1oKKz7NOw,276800,279520,u-turns to get myself back around
Fg1oKKz7NOw,279520,282479,oh these controls suck it would be like
Fg1oKKz7NOw,282479,285600,if superman 64 were broken
Fg1oKKz7NOw,285600,288320,but of all the games i've auditioned i
Fg1oKKz7NOw,288320,290160,think the one you need to see
Fg1oKKz7NOw,290160,292800,is per pals
Fg1oKKz7NOw,292800,294639,it's one of those virtual pet games
Fg1oKKz7NOw,294639,296720,where you raise a pet first you pick
Fg1oKKz7NOw,296720,299199,your cat and i gotta hand it to them the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,299199,301840,customization is off the hook i can't
Fg1oKKz7NOw,301840,303680,believe how many different cat breeds
Fg1oKKz7NOw,303680,305120,they've included here
Fg1oKKz7NOw,305120,308000,oh my they have a turkish van well
Fg1oKKz7NOw,308000,310000,that's just perfect because i have a
Fg1oKKz7NOw,310000,312720,real turkish van for 14 years now named
Fg1oKKz7NOw,312720,315360,yeti and for this occasion i think you
Fg1oKKz7NOw,315360,317440,should meet the elusive yeti
Fg1oKKz7NOw,317440,318320,oh
Fg1oKKz7NOw,318320,321680,so damn cute oh you're so soft you're so
Fg1oKKz7NOw,321680,323759,soft you white little fluffy piece of
Fg1oKKz7NOw,323759,324639,[ __ ]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,324639,327759,oh you [ __ ] [ __ ] face
Fg1oKKz7NOw,327759,330400,anyway the main gist of the game is to
Fg1oKKz7NOw,330400,332160,maintain the pet and keep up with her
Fg1oKKz7NOw,332160,334479,needs does she need grooming alright
Fg1oKKz7NOw,334479,336639,well groom that [ __ ] oh god they
Fg1oKKz7NOw,336639,339039,animated the cat lifting its ass that's
Fg1oKKz7NOw,339039,340960,what cats do but this one looks like she
Fg1oKKz7NOw,340960,342560,just stepped in a puddle with a live
Fg1oKKz7NOw,342560,345600,wire the way it really goes is like this
Fg1oKKz7NOw,345600,347520,pet your cat down the back and they
Fg1oKKz7NOw,347520,349919,raise their butt to the sky it's almost
Fg1oKKz7NOw,349919,352160,automatic like it's a button a button
Fg1oKKz7NOw,352160,354960,called butt on you know i looked up the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,354960,357280,reason why cats do this it's because
Fg1oKKz7NOw,357280,359280,they want to mark you with their scent
Fg1oKKz7NOw,359280,360160,from
Fg1oKKz7NOw,360160,362240,their anal glands
Fg1oKKz7NOw,362240,363039,oh
Fg1oKKz7NOw,363039,364479,god yeti
Fg1oKKz7NOw,364479,366160,i like whenever you pet the cat she
Fg1oKKz7NOw,366160,368639,sparkles yeah that's right you ever have
Fg1oKKz7NOw,368639,370800,that happen you ever pet your cat and it
Fg1oKKz7NOw,370800,372000,sparkles
Fg1oKKz7NOw,372000,374400,oh yeah the old lady old lady yeti old
Fg1oKKz7NOw,374400,375919,lady yeah
Fg1oKKz7NOw,375919,378240,so much fur so much [ __ ] furry little
Fg1oKKz7NOw,378240,379520,piece of [ __ ]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,379520,381440,she can also play with a ball of yarn
Fg1oKKz7NOw,381440,383600,here oh you want this yarn here go get
Fg1oKKz7NOw,383600,386080,it oh [ __ ] i threw in the tub and the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,386080,388319,playing was so intense it made the tub
Fg1oKKz7NOw,388319,390560,disappear this cat never actually
Fg1oKKz7NOw,390560,392560,touches the yarn she just runs near it
Fg1oKKz7NOw,392560,394639,and rolls around what's this cat's
Fg1oKKz7NOw,394639,397360,problem if the cat's hungry you feed her
Fg1oKKz7NOw,397360,399759,she anxiously waits by standing and
Fg1oKKz7NOw,399759,402240,clapping like she's at some dance party
Fg1oKKz7NOw,402240,403440,yeah you know when you bring your cat
Fg1oKKz7NOw,403440,406319,food and [ __ ] dances
Fg1oKKz7NOw,406319,408960,the idea is simple you put the food in
Fg1oKKz7NOw,408960,411680,the bowl right
Fg1oKKz7NOw,411680,413840,you take the sponsored purina can and
Fg1oKKz7NOw,413840,416880,put it in the green bowl with the arrow
Fg1oKKz7NOw,416880,419039,nope that's not a food can that's the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,419039,421120,bowl the cat eats out of okay so you
Fg1oKKz7NOw,421120,422960,grab the purina from the inventory on
Fg1oKKz7NOw,422960,424960,the left and you place it in the pure in
Fg1oKKz7NOw,424960,427199,a bowl
Fg1oKKz7NOw,427199,430240,nope okay you take the purina from the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,430240,432960,inventory and place it in the green bowl
Fg1oKKz7NOw,432960,434880,and then you awkwardly turn the wii
Fg1oKKz7NOw,434880,437039,remote to pour it out it lands in the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,437039,439039,bowl and teleports its way into the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,439039,440319,purina bowl
Fg1oKKz7NOw,440319,442319,oh and that other blue dish never mind
Fg1oKKz7NOw,442319,443120,that
Fg1oKKz7NOw,443120,444639,why does there have to be so many
Fg1oKKz7NOw,444639,445840,different bowls it would have been the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,445840,448160,simplest thing to program just have the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,448160,450880,food here and the dish here
Fg1oKKz7NOw,450880,453039,and also who puts their cat dish in the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,453039,455520,direct center of the kitchen anyway
Fg1oKKz7NOw,455520,458000,you can even spray the cat with water oh
Fg1oKKz7NOw,458000,460080,come on really then there's a bunch of
Fg1oKKz7NOw,460080,462880,mini games like mouse hunt you control a
Fg1oKKz7NOw,462880,464960,mouse and have to sneak past the cat
Fg1oKKz7NOw,464960,466639,without getting caught wouldn't it be
Fg1oKKz7NOw,466639,468639,more fun if you were controlling the cat
Fg1oKKz7NOw,468639,470960,besides a mouse would never be stupid
Fg1oKKz7NOw,470960,472879,enough to get that close to a cat but
Fg1oKKz7NOw,472879,474720,who cares about any of that what really
Fg1oKKz7NOw,474720,477199,concerns me is the gasoline and propane
Fg1oKKz7NOw,477199,479280,tank who the hell lets their cat play
Fg1oKKz7NOw,479280,481919,around gasoline and propane doesn't seem
Fg1oKKz7NOw,481919,484319,like the safest area of course it's just
Fg1oKKz7NOw,484319,486319,a game but what raises the biggest
Fg1oKKz7NOw,486319,488560,question is why did they design it that
Fg1oKKz7NOw,488560,491360,way why do they stick out so much
Fg1oKKz7NOw,491360,493120,i have a hard time believing that
Fg1oKKz7NOw,493120,495120,they're just part of the scenery don't
Fg1oKKz7NOw,495120,497680,they seem like props you're meant to
Fg1oKKz7NOw,497680,499039,interact with
Fg1oKKz7NOw,499039,500319,it just leaves you with an ominous
Fg1oKKz7NOw,500319,501490,feeling
Fg1oKKz7NOw,501490,520719,[Music]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,520719,522399,nothing
Fg1oKKz7NOw,522399,524560,oh the cat went through the tire of
Fg1oKKz7NOw,524560,526320,course the cat's hanging around gasses
Fg1oKKz7NOw,526320,528240,and chemicals so much it reduces the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,528240,530399,cat's molecular density allowing her to
Fg1oKKz7NOw,530399,532560,pass through solid matter this cat
Fg1oKKz7NOw,532560,534720,definitely has supernatural properties
Fg1oKKz7NOw,534720,536959,it levitates you ever see your cat
Fg1oKKz7NOw,536959,540500,levitate what do you think yeti
Fg1oKKz7NOw,540500,544160,[Music]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,544160,547279,then there's a golf game yeah golf you
Fg1oKKz7NOw,547279,548880,might wonder what this has to do with
Fg1oKKz7NOw,548880,549920,cats
Fg1oKKz7NOw,549920,552880,well um the cat has an owner and the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,552880,555279,owner likes to play golf in the backyard
Fg1oKKz7NOw,555279,556880,so basically it has nothing to do with
Fg1oKKz7NOw,556880,560160,anything oh [ __ ] almost hit the cat then
Fg1oKKz7NOw,560160,561680,there's ping pong
Fg1oKKz7NOw,561680,563850,oh god
Fg1oKKz7NOw,563850,568399,[Laughter]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,568399,570880,oh oh make it stop
Fg1oKKz7NOw,570880,573920,stop it's killing me
Fg1oKKz7NOw,573920,575120,i i
Fg1oKKz7NOw,575120,577200,of thought the cat would
Fg1oKKz7NOw,577200,579360,chase the ping pong ball you know like
Fg1oKKz7NOw,579360,580480,cats do
Fg1oKKz7NOw,580480,583279,but no this cat is actually playing
Fg1oKKz7NOw,583279,585600,[ __ ] bing bong and it's a pro
Fg1oKKz7NOw,585600,587440,did the people who designed this game
Fg1oKKz7NOw,587440,590320,ever own or know a cat that doesn't
Fg1oKKz7NOw,590320,591600,happen
Fg1oKKz7NOw,591600,594240,oh but it's great this is the stuff of
Fg1oKKz7NOw,594240,595680,[ __ ] legend
Fg1oKKz7NOw,595680,597120,all right let's see what you got cat

Fg1oKKz7NOw,654560,657040,me is that it seems this gnome is in a
Fg1oKKz7NOw,657040,659360,different spot than before now if i had
Fg1oKKz7NOw,659360,662240,a gnome statue in my backyard and every
Fg1oKKz7NOw,662240,663600,time i looked out the window it was in a
Fg1oKKz7NOw,663600,665440,different spot i'd uh
Fg1oKKz7NOw,665440,667680,i'd be a little bit concerned
Fg1oKKz7NOw,667680,670160,wish that cat would do something come on

Fg1oKKz7NOw,690640,693440,that is ingenious and totally
Fg1oKKz7NOw,693440,695040,unrealistic there's so many other things
Fg1oKKz7NOw,695040,696560,that could include it that a real cat
Fg1oKKz7NOw,696560,698320,would have done there's of course the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,698320,700480,classic chasing of the laser pen the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,700480,702800,game we like to call kill the red dot
Fg1oKKz7NOw,702800,705200,which is in the game basically but what
Fg1oKKz7NOw,705200,706800,about drinking out of the sink that
Fg1oKKz7NOw,706800,708560,would have been a good one aim the cat's
Fg1oKKz7NOw,708560,710320,tongue to catch the water
Fg1oKKz7NOw,710320,712240,i've often wondered why cats never drink
Fg1oKKz7NOw,712240,714079,the water after you fill the dish i mean
Fg1oKKz7NOw,714079,716079,it's the same exact water that came out
Fg1oKKz7NOw,716079,718240,of the faucet yeah but what fun is the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,718240,719920,dish i mean they want the water to be
Fg1oKKz7NOw,719920,721920,fresh and flowing those picky little
Fg1oKKz7NOw,721920,724000,bastards how about a stage where you
Fg1oKKz7NOw,724000,726000,have to open the door for the cat but
Fg1oKKz7NOw,726000,728079,the cat changes its mind so you have to
Fg1oKKz7NOw,728079,730000,keep reopening it or how about when
Fg1oKKz7NOw,730000,732000,you're trying to walk and the cat stays
Fg1oKKz7NOw,732000,733360,one step in front of you so you got to
Fg1oKKz7NOw,733360,735120,walk really slow i mean i wouldn't want
Fg1oKKz7NOw,735120,737040,to walk near somebody's legs i mean it's
Fg1oKKz7NOw,737040,738959,just this big giant coming at you i mean
Fg1oKKz7NOw,738959,740560,why do they do that or how about when
Fg1oKKz7NOw,740560,742000,you're trying to go down the steps but
Fg1oKKz7NOw,742000,743440,they run past you because they gotta
Fg1oKKz7NOw,743440,745279,erase you to the bottom or how about a
Fg1oKKz7NOw,745279,747279,stage where you control the cat leaping
Fg1oKKz7NOw,747279,749440,on a different furniture to get up high
Fg1oKKz7NOw,749440,752399,yeah you've never seen a cat think so
Fg1oKKz7NOw,752399,754000,hard as to when it's planning the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,754000,756560,trajectory of its next jump the ultimate
Fg1oKKz7NOw,756560,758560,goal is to reach the highest spot you
Fg1oKKz7NOw,758560,760880,know it's the king kong complex climb to
Fg1oKKz7NOw,760880,763360,the highest peak to show who's boss have
Fg1oKKz7NOw,763360,764720,a stage where you get up out of your
Fg1oKKz7NOw,764720,766720,chair and then have to race back before
Fg1oKKz7NOw,766720,768560,the cat steals your spot how about a
Fg1oKKz7NOw,768560,770000,target practice game where you got to
Fg1oKKz7NOw,770000,772240,claw the cursor on the computer screen
Fg1oKKz7NOw,772240,773839,how about one where you headbutt your
Fg1oKKz7NOw,773839,775920,owner or when were you climb into their
Fg1oKKz7NOw,775920,777839,lap and then just sink your [ __ ]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,777839,780160,claws in there or where you chase their
Fg1oKKz7NOw,780160,782079,foot under a blanket like it's a moving
Fg1oKKz7NOw,782079,784560,animal how about one where you close the
Fg1oKKz7NOw,784560,786480,closet door not knowing the cat's in
Fg1oKKz7NOw,786480,788160,there now you think the cat would meow
Fg1oKKz7NOw,788160,790480,because having the door open would mean
Fg1oKKz7NOw,790480,792240,they can come out whenever they want but
Fg1oKKz7NOw,792240,793760,no no they're not ready to come out yet
Fg1oKKz7NOw,793760,795519,so they're going to wait hours then
Fg1oKKz7NOw,795519,798000,they're going to meow because cats only
Fg1oKKz7NOw,798000,799440,think in the moment
Fg1oKKz7NOw,799440,801760,so anyway that's a lot of ideas right
Fg1oKKz7NOw,801760,805440,there but no how on earth did they come
Fg1oKKz7NOw,805440,808959,up with cats shooting arrows at hearts
Fg1oKKz7NOw,808959,811279,it's those damn cats again always up on
Fg1oKKz7NOw,811279,813040,the ledge shooting those hearts with an
Fg1oKKz7NOw,813040,815519,arrow who's holding the bow anyway and
Fg1oKKz7NOw,815519,817360,where are the other cat's ears then
Fg1oKKz7NOw,817360,820240,there's a simon says game called copycat
Fg1oKKz7NOw,820240,822160,where you watch the colored lights and
Fg1oKKz7NOw,822160,826279,then copy the same pattern
Fg1oKKz7NOw,828560,830399,you gotta love how the cats poke their
Fg1oKKz7NOw,830399,831010,heads out
Fg1oKKz7NOw,831010,834000,[Laughter]
Fg1oKKz7NOw,834000,836000,i especially love the one that jumps out
Fg1oKKz7NOw,836000,836959,the top
Fg1oKKz7NOw,836959,838480,then there's a singing game where you
Fg1oKKz7NOw,838480,842120,have to catch the notes
Fg1oKKz7NOw,847519,849600,this is the reason why video games were
Fg1oKKz7NOw,849600,851360,invented
Fg1oKKz7NOw,851360,853680,anyway there's not much else to this
