cvBa6Dcws-4,19360,23840,what happens when the biggest toy maker in  the world the lego group decides to bring  
cvBa6Dcws-4,23840,29120,their blocks to the virtual space and attempt an  mmorpg of their own well if i'm talking about it  
cvBa6Dcws-4,29120,33680,in this series we kind of know that that didn't  go according to plan it only took about a year to  
cvBa6Dcws-4,33680,38480,face its demise because as soon as lego universe  launched developed by net devil and published  
cvBa6Dcws-4,38480,44480,by the lego group it was gone released back in  october of 2010 lego universe was an innovative  
cvBa6Dcws-4,44480,49600,crafting and youngling focused mmo not unlike  minecraft that would later launch and shock the  
cvBa6Dcws-4,49600,54719,world just after lego universe was announced to  be shutting down minecraft and roblox both would  
cvBa6Dcws-4,54720,60160,change the gaming space entirely so why was lego  universe despite being first and innovative in his  
cvBa6Dcws-4,60160,66240,own right unable to share similar success and why  just one year after launch was the title shuttered

cvBa6Dcws-4,148240,155840,too thanks again to opera gx for sponsoring this  video let's get back to the video detectives
cvBa6Dcws-4,158320,163520,the story begins far back in 2002 where an early  team within the lego group an interlocking toy  
cvBa6Dcws-4,163520,168000,company from denmark now the largest toy  company in the world valued at 6 billion  
cvBa6Dcws-4,168000,173040,would begin building an online infrastructure  this online infrastructure dubbed project arena  
cvBa6Dcws-4,173040,178239,was heavily inspired by mmos that had risen to  popularity at the time by 2002 lego group had  
cvBa6Dcws-4,178240,183200,put out easily a dozen video games but their  most successful title wouldn't come until 2005  
cvBa6Dcws-4,183200,188560,utilizing one of the biggest ips in the world star  wars people within lego group were interested in  
cvBa6Dcws-4,188560,193599,mmos but the company's lack of big success  in video games and unfamiliarity with mmos  
cvBa6Dcws-4,193600,197600,meant that they were hesitant to get involved  early on in 2004 we saw the effects of this  
cvBa6Dcws-4,197600,202320,slow movement when a team of eight developers  began heavily researching mmos within lego group  
cvBa6Dcws-4,202320,206800,of the eight developers was mark hanson the  game's later senior director and ronnie schreier  
cvBa6Dcws-4,206800,210800,who was the director of development this led  directly to the creation of a system used to take  
cvBa6Dcws-4,210800,216160,bricks from the real world and digitize them to be  used in the virtual one the lego digital designer  
cvBa6Dcws-4,216160,220880,that still is in existence today it wasn't  until lego group would face immense success  
cvBa6Dcws-4,220880,225440,from their star wars lego game that gaming would  be taken seriously within the company and thus an  
cvBa6Dcws-4,225440,230160,online lego game was given tacit approval for  pre-production lego group would begin sorting  
cvBa6Dcws-4,230160,234880,through 50 different developers looking for the  right one to work on an online lego game narrowing  
cvBa6Dcws-4,234880,240880,down in the end two companies in particular funcom  and netdevil funcom just off the rocky start of  
cvBa6Dcws-4,240880,246160,anarchy online which would later become one of  the pioneer greatest sci-fi mmos of all time  
cvBa6Dcws-4,246160,249840,net devil was fresh off of the title that they  did by teaming up with none other than korean  
cvBa6Dcws-4,249840,254959,developer publisher nc soft auto assault both of  these titles were covered on the death of a game  
cvBa6Dcws-4,254960,260239,series but both for very different reasons anarchy  online faced that sort of natural cause sort of  
cvBa6Dcws-4,260239,265440,death while net devil's auto assault barely even  lasted a year and was seen by most as a dud at  
cvBa6Dcws-4,265440,270720,worse in an interesting concept at best however  net devil would actually win out the battle of the  
cvBa6Dcws-4,270720,275520,lego contract reportedly due to their experience  and excitement with the project to be fair to lego  
cvBa6Dcws-4,275520,280319,group net devil's title ottawa saw it hadn't  yet failed because it didn't launch until 2006  
cvBa6Dcws-4,280320,284960,though was shuttered later in 2007. if it's not  clear i'm slightly calling into question the pick  
cvBa6Dcws-4,284960,289280,of netdevil in the first place it's because sure  i wasn't there behind the closed doors to see all  
cvBa6Dcws-4,289280,294160,of the pitches including net devils it must have  been a hell of a pitch for funcom a nordic company  
cvBa6Dcws-4,294160,299360,to lose to netdevil who hadn't even launched  successful mmo yet the strong faith in net  
cvBa6Dcws-4,299360,304240,devil based on experience just doesn't make that  much sense to me though unless the idea is that we  
cvBa6Dcws-4,304240,309840,can't find any actual mmo developers so let's just  settle for ones that worked on one that failed
cvBa6Dcws-4,316000,319760,problems for the online lego game would  begin as early as pre-production due to  
cvBa6Dcws-4,319760,324320,a massive time difference between the lego  group and denmark and net devil in colorado  
cvBa6Dcws-4,324320,328560,this wouldn't be that big of a deal for most  developer publisher relations but lego group  
cvBa6Dcws-4,328560,333600,wanted to be involved in the development thus  complicating things the lego game's official  
cvBa6Dcws-4,333600,340880,name would be finalized june 2007 lego universe  with the targeted q4 2008 release date in tow this  
cvBa6Dcws-4,340880,345280,would be a difficult thing to deliver on though  as we would later find out in a tele article  
cvBa6Dcws-4,345280,350080,concerning lego universe it was stated by 2008  that lego universe had been in development for  
cvBa6Dcws-4,350080,354319,two years but was having issues of identity and  net devil knowing what the game was supposed to be  
cvBa6Dcws-4,354880,358960,if that wasn't bad enough net devil in  the process of developing lego universe  
cvBa6Dcws-4,358960,364240,had started to go bankrupt i'm assuming that  otto assault failure in 2007 didn't help either  
cvBa6Dcws-4,364240,367840,this meant that they had to open up to the  possibilities of being acquired by another  
cvBa6Dcws-4,367840,372639,company in order to get funding and continue  development coming quietly in the summer of 2008  
cvBa6Dcws-4,372640,376560,was an acquisition that wouldn't be announced  officially until the spring of the next year  
cvBa6Dcws-4,376560,381440,net devil would be acquired by venture capital  powered gazillion entertainment according to the  
cvBa6Dcws-4,381440,386240,net devil team this acquisition would prove to be  quite a disaster in the end the sale would lead to  
cvBa6Dcws-4,386240,391120,more slowing in the game's development and eroded  the trust of the new owners gazillion was now in  
cvBa6Dcws-4,391120,396320,charge too and very likely was getting more and  more control over their project lego universe  
cvBa6Dcws-4,396320,401360,itself this is the most disastrous decision the  lego group could have ever made said mark hansen  
cvBa6Dcws-4,401360,405919,the senior director with the lego group that's  because gazillion was primarily a venture capital  
cvBa6Dcws-4,405920,410240,developer which meant that they kind of make games  to make money not that everyone else doesn't but  
cvBa6Dcws-4,410240,414479,you get the drift but it wasn't as simple as just  lego groups shouldn't have lost trust in net devil  
cvBa6Dcws-4,414480,418800,either when net devil was close to being shuttered  without gazillion stepping in in the first place  
cvBa6Dcws-4,418800,423440,this meant that without the acquisition problems  or not lego universe according to key developers  
cvBa6Dcws-4,423440,427120,wouldn't have even made it to the finish  line but it's not just a devil or the good  
cvBa6Dcws-4,427120,432800,guy situation here either because lego group did  report that they seemed aimless and needed help
cvBa6Dcws-4,435120,440400,lego universe hosted a friends and family alpha  december 8th 2009 letting the game be playable  
cvBa6Dcws-4,440400,445600,by others for the first time lego universe was  targeting the younger audience the same audience  
cvBa6Dcws-4,445600,451360,who primarily had legos purchased for them this  provided quite the interesting predicament as mmos  
cvBa6Dcws-4,451360,456400,so far had been marketed towards older players  this isn't to say that younger players won't or  
cvBa6Dcws-4,456400,461520,don't like mmos but it meant that if you wanted to  attract a new audience to a genre it was going to  
cvBa6Dcws-4,461520,466560,take a lot of onboarding to do such and you had to  be careful not to appeal too much to a brand new  
cvBa6Dcws-4,466560,472000,audience in the mmo genre unless you angered the  standard mmo audience that already existed there  
cvBa6Dcws-4,472000,477040,it's difficult to market an mmo to children let  alone went with a subscription fee which had been  
cvBa6Dcws-4,477040,482160,a big barrier at the time it's hard to make money  from an audience who doesn't have any money that  
cvBa6Dcws-4,482160,487360,requires a constant consistent purchase like a  subscription fee barriers to entry make emma most  
cvBa6Dcws-4,487360,492319,difficult to play for the younger audience lego  universe would announce its beta in march set  
cvBa6Dcws-4,492320,498160,for the summer of 2010 becoming playable to those  who utilized file planet to download the game oh  
cvBa6Dcws-4,498160,504800,file planet the memories that's pretty much how i  played so many different mmos pc gamer would post  
cvBa6Dcws-4,504800,509280,positive beta impressions concerning lego universe  where they would talk about really enjoying the  
cvBa6Dcws-4,509280,513200,game and the diverse activities that the game  had you participate in despite it being so  
cvBa6Dcws-4,513200,518159,kid-friendly pc gamer would discuss two different  themed levels or worlds as they would be dubbed  
cvBa6Dcws-4,518159,523680,in lego universe that provided unique gameplay  experiences and feels while not a ton of detail  
cvBa6Dcws-4,523680,527839,had been released concerning what the gameplan  lego universe would actually consist of what was  
cvBa6Dcws-4,527840,532560,shown to those who tested alpha or closed beta  had been positively received thus far the real  
cvBa6Dcws-4,532560,537120,test would be if lego universe could thrive post  launch and the fateful months that would follow  
cvBa6Dcws-4,537120,542080,as players get more and more time to dig into  the title as is standard for any mmo of the time  
cvBa6Dcws-4,543360,549600,lego universe would showcase a fancy new e3  trailer june 17 2010 showing off what looked to  
cvBa6Dcws-4,549600,554319,be a world story set for the game where a team  of legos are in search for the essence of pure  
cvBa6Dcws-4,554320,559120,imagination that goes horribly wrong and the  result is a super wacky and creative game that  
cvBa6Dcws-4,559120,564240,allows players to essentially build and bring  to life their very own lego figures meanwhile  
cvBa6Dcws-4,564240,568880,the same month as lego universe was looking very  much impressive on the biggest stage in gaming  
cvBa6Dcws-4,568880,574560,e3 minecraft which needs no introduction was  quietly entering its alpha and it wouldn't be  
cvBa6Dcws-4,574560,579680,quiet for much longer minecraft was already  generating immense buzz and hype before even  
cvBa6Dcws-4,579680,584720,reaching its beta and whether or not the lego  universe team wanted it or not they were set on  
cvBa6Dcws-4,584720,589839,a crash course with minecraft and we all have  the glory of hindsight to know how that went  
cvBa6Dcws-4,594240,598959,after numerous delays and issues behind the  scenes lego universe after four to five years  
cvBa6Dcws-4,598960,604320,of development would launch october 26 2010  globally lego universe would be charging a  
cvBa6Dcws-4,604320,609840,box price of forty dollars with an additional sub  fee as typical for the time in mmos of ten dollars  
cvBa6Dcws-4,610480,614240,lego universe would score a 70 out of  a hundred on aggregate review website  
cvBa6Dcws-4,614240,618800,metacritic from 11 different critics with  a similar review score amongst the players  
cvBa6Dcws-4,618800,624320,while a 70 isn't outright impressive it wasn't a  bad score and certainly gave the team around lego  
cvBa6Dcws-4,624320,629200,universe something to work with theoretically but  the reviews on lego universe are within the first  
cvBa6Dcws-4,629200,634160,month which means they could have been singing  a different tune quite soon after you can't  
cvBa6Dcws-4,634160,640399,ever judge the success of an mmo based on launch  alone ign and eurogamer both however would score  
cvBa6Dcws-4,640400,645840,lego universe a non-impressive 5 out of 10. ign  would state the lego universe was a fixer-upper  
cvBa6Dcws-4,645840,650720,and needed a lot of work on the bugs present  in the game and a general lack of content ign  
cvBa6Dcws-4,650720,655439,was positive about the sheer creativity possible  in lego universe though which included auto snap  
cvBa6Dcws-4,655440,660080,building and free building which brought lego  creativity to the virtual space as promised  
cvBa6Dcws-4,660080,665360,you could even customize your very own world which  is effectively instance player housing on steroids  
cvBa6Dcws-4,665360,670000,because you could bring to life your creations  eurogamer would mimic the positives that ign  
cvBa6Dcws-4,670000,674880,would state but were quite negative concerning the  actual core gameplay outside of the lego building  
cvBa6Dcws-4,674880,679600,likening it to a ludicrous grind that leads to  nowhere the most damning part of the eurogamer  
cvBa6Dcws-4,679600,684560,review however was concerning the lack of content  in lego universe according to eurogamer you could  
cvBa6Dcws-4,684560,689200,complete half of the content in a single day  this was because the universe concept in lego  
cvBa6Dcws-4,689200,693760,universe worlds or aka levels where players  could traverse through them despite how pretty  
cvBa6Dcws-4,693760,697280,looking they were were constructed in a way  where they were nothing more than mid-sized  
cvBa6Dcws-4,697280,702080,questing areas when compared to other mmos that  means that once you're out of the nimbus station  
cvBa6Dcws-4,702080,707680,you have a tutorial world to visit and then two  other major worlds and that's it there weren't  
cvBa6Dcws-4,707680,712160,any other worlds to really traverse to yet and  according to documents released after the fact  
cvBa6Dcws-4,712160,716720,this was because the team behind lego universe  wanted to create a number of themed worlds to  
cvBa6Dcws-4,716720,722000,flesh out the game but had difficulties creating  them due to time expectations from the lego group  
cvBa6Dcws-4,722000,726560,a bunch of ideas but not a whole lot of  implementation in other words lego universe  
cvBa6Dcws-4,726560,731200,wasn't blowing the doors off of the world just  yet but it was impressive especially for lego  
cvBa6Dcws-4,731200,735600,fans it just clearly needed a little bit more  time in the oven and a bit more focus couple that  
cvBa6Dcws-4,735600,740240,with a lackluster combat style that just seems  to blend action elements with the mmo elements  
cvBa6Dcws-4,740240,744720,in a way that doesn't quite understand what's  going on it just misses the actual depth of an  
cvBa6Dcws-4,744720,749360,mmo and its sheer options of ability and choice  if you're not a fan of the auto attack combat  
cvBa6Dcws-4,749360,754079,style you had the limited options of additional  abilities being limited to well mostly four at  
cvBa6Dcws-4,754080,759600,a time it felt like playing an incredibly paired  down mmo without the appropriate payout for such
cvBa6Dcws-4,765200,769440,the work in progress success wasn't good enough  for the lego group however who reportedly  
cvBa6Dcws-4,769440,774960,projected to have a hundred and eighty thousand  subscribers in actuality the game launched with 14  
cvBa6Dcws-4,774960,780720,000 pre-orders and then plateaued at 38 000 copies  while those numbers aren't very impressive they  
cvBa6Dcws-4,780720,786000,are certainly serviceable not all mmos started as  titans with hundreds of thousands of players and  
cvBa6Dcws-4,786000,791280,you can always work to build that audience which  is the idea anyway right however lego group's  
cvBa6Dcws-4,791280,796320,expectations were completely unreasonable they  wanted a developer whose previous history was a  
cvBa6Dcws-4,796320,803360,failed mmo to beat the greatest mmos of all time  and secure 180 000 players at launch not even  
cvBa6Dcws-4,803360,809360,everquest eve runescape or ultima online could get  numbers like that for a launch they must have been  
cvBa6Dcws-4,809360,814959,hit by the wow bug but whatever it was it was bad  and unreasonable expectations that could doom a  
cvBa6Dcws-4,814960,820960,project because you're going to pull the plug way  too soon mmos are long-term investments by nature  
cvBa6Dcws-4,820960,826320,many charge monthly fees after all approaching  the mmo market with the idea of instant riches  
cvBa6Dcws-4,826320,830640,is foolhardy and we have seen that time and time  again on this series these expectations would  
cvBa6Dcws-4,830640,835200,prove to be critical as after launch news hit  the web that the original founders of net devil  
cvBa6Dcws-4,835200,840160,had left the company and were no longer involved  in lego universe this included ryan seabury peter  
cvBa6Dcws-4,840160,845279,grundy and scott brown whether it was the lack  of success or their growing poor relations with  
cvBa6Dcws-4,845280,850400,gazillion both were crucial factors lego universe  losing the key developers originally involved  
cvBa6Dcws-4,850400,855840,on the project such as the creative director  himself surely wasn't a good look for the game
cvBa6Dcws-4,863040,867680,minecraft would enter beta december 2010 and  by this point the world couldn't keep quiet  
cvBa6Dcws-4,867680,872399,about the game anymore minecraft unlike lego  universe was beauty and simplicity whereas  
cvBa6Dcws-4,872400,877040,lego universe offered very advanced building  options and scripting patterns minecraft was  
cvBa6Dcws-4,877040,881600,just about gathering materials in a voxel visual  style and building out structures or surviving  
cvBa6Dcws-4,881600,886880,the harsh environment you could create complex  structures sure or just simple stuff in minecraft  
cvBa6Dcws-4,886880,892400,the gameplay and building were intertwined and  weren't separated completely like in lego universe  
cvBa6Dcws-4,892400,897920,the simple visual style made minecraft playable  on basically any machine meanwhile lego universe  
cvBa6Dcws-4,897920,902959,despite its simple lego visuals was actually  quite complex and utilized the game brio engine  
cvBa6Dcws-4,902960,907440,lego universe was only playable on higher end  machines too which would mean that the younger  
cvBa6Dcws-4,907440,912080,audience it was trying to attract now needed to  have fancy computers and convince their parents  
cvBa6Dcws-4,912080,916880,to pay a sub fee these are some rather large  barriers to entry when compared to minecraft's  
cvBa6Dcws-4,916880,922400,low box price no sub fee and the ability to be  played on a toaster lego universe wasn't a bad  
cvBa6Dcws-4,922400,927680,game by any stretch but it was going up against a  title that would go on to revolutionize gaming all  
cvBa6Dcws-4,927680,933120,the while doing so with such beautiful simplicity  mmos already have a tough barrier to entry
cvBa6Dcws-4,937760,941920,coming not as a surprise to those watching this  video but as i'm surprised about everybody else  
cvBa6Dcws-4,941920,947279,involved into the project up until the morning of  was massive layoffs at netdevil amounting to 20  
cvBa6Dcws-4,947920,952720,of their workforce being terminated  employees found out via a facebook posting  
cvBa6Dcws-4,952720,957519,which is just gross more news would come out  of the affair with news that gazillion would  
cvBa6Dcws-4,957520,961440,be selling their development stake of lego  universe to the lego group thus the layoffs  
cvBa6Dcws-4,961440,965520,were described as positive since the original  developers were mostly rehired at the lego  
cvBa6Dcws-4,965520,970880,group to continue to develop the game development  teams do often shrink following a launch but this  
cvBa6Dcws-4,970880,975200,was more than just that there was definitely  some drama between net devil and gazillion  
cvBa6Dcws-4,975200,979760,and in the end the lego group mostly took  netdevil's side perhaps now with these things  
cvBa6Dcws-4,979760,984240,settled the game could get some much needed  focus and love to get back into a better shape  
cvBa6Dcws-4,985600,990560,another of the large issues plaguing lego universe  was how much it cost like we covered with free  
cvBa6Dcws-4,990560,994800,realms a game we also featured on the death of  a game series it's hard to get kids to pay money  
cvBa6Dcws-4,994800,999279,monthly to play a game or any game really they  have to ask their parents to use their credit  
cvBa6Dcws-4,999280,1005040,card and a constant charge versus a one-and-done  or a free-to-play approach is just a harder sell  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1005040,1010240,and trust me i can say that from experience not  only did you have to buy lego universe for 40  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1010240,1013920,though that price would quickly drop down to  much lower you still had to pay a monthly fee  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1013920,1019920,on top of that which is a tough ask in 2011 as  the standards for such had risen so highly in  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1019920,1024640,order for lego universe to remain competitive and  get any audience they were going to have to change  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1024640,1029760,their approach to pricing like many other mmos of  the time the move to free to play was an option  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1029760,1034800,to increase player count and thus revenue lego  universe was looking to share some of that success  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1034800,1039760,the titles like city of heroes swotore and lord  of the rings made from going into free to play the  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1039760,1044560,only problem was they didn't do enough research to  make sure that possibility was a reality instead  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1044560,1049600,what players got was a very limited trial account  that you needed to pay ten dollars to then upgrade  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1049600,1053360,so for ten dollars a month you could get access  to the five worlds included into the game  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1053360,1057520,and any new content set to release you don't  need to look far to know that this isn't what  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1057520,1062160,other mmos were offering when they went free to  play instead they were offering near complete  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1062160,1067040,gaming experiences that offered some more content  in piecemeal fashion that you could purchase or  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1067040,1071600,unlock with the sub fee sometimes the sub fee  was just a bonus thing too and not required  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1071600,1075919,lego universe being free to play is more  accurately described as getting a free  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1075920,1081840,trial and the success was immediate and obviously  helped lego universe reach 2.3 million players and  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1081840,1087520,a hundred thousand subscriptions in tow it just  wasn't enough success not for lego group and the  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1087520,1093680,heavy expectations placed on lego universe imagine  had they actually gone fully free to play though  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1093680,1097920,what those numbers could have looked like lego  universe was just an online title with some key  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1097920,1102960,issues that needed ironing out or more importantly  the time to do such perhaps lego universe could  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1102960,1107840,take their newfound success from the business  model switch and parlay it into some more  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1109440,1114000,countdown to the power of the nexus force treated  much like an expansion added a plethora of new  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1114000,1119440,special teaser classes and new missions including  dailies and 75 new achievements what the new  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1119440,1124720,update didn't bring however was more substantial  content in the way of new worlds raids or dungeons  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1124720,1130000,as most common in mmos instead the lego universe  team focused on content in already discovered  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1130000,1135680,areas which both aren't as fun or impactful and  at the end of the day the game's name is lego  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1135680,1140640,universe it's clearly a game about adding new  worlds to traverse and explore with new worlds  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1140640,1145280,and zones being added the different unique lego  themes was one of the strengths of lego universe  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1145280,1149600,there just wasn't enough of it for comfort and  it's definitely not like lego is lacking in  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1149600,1154559,worlds and universes to explore having had dozens  of high-profile collaborations with the likes of  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1154560,1160000,star wars harry potter and much more they designed  one of the worlds to be literally a hub world  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1160000,1164320,meaning that you could join other worlds from it  there's just only five of them to choose from and  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1164320,1168639,that's probably one of the included ones that's  just not enough content to charge a subscription  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1168640,1173360,fee for lego group might have had some heavy  expectations of lego universe but they hadn't  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1173360,1177840,put in the heavy support to match whether it be  marketing or financial help until september 2011  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1178400,1183680,according to the lego universe team lego group  waiting a year to fully support their first online  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1183680,1188640,project was puzzling but their help was finally  coming in the way of a ninja merchandise push  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1188640,1194320,by the fall of 2011. but would lego group provide  enough support long enough to see lego universe  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1194320,1199679,grow to something more don't you hate it when  the next scene answers last scene's question  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1199680,1204640,well sadly within two months lego group had seen  enough according to the lego group they would  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1204640,1209840,be shuttering lego universe january of the next  year citing a lack of subscribers as the reason  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1209840,1213919,but the story wasn't that black and  white the subscriber numbers were there  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1213920,1219120,they just weren't impressive enough this is super  common of corporations with no mmo experience to  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1219120,1224240,expect a return on their investment immediately  in a long-term focused investment market  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1224240,1229679,but lego universe wasn't a bad game in fact it  had a resub rate of 87 percent which meant that  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1229680,1234480,it most definitely had a core audience and was  managing to hold on to them quite well content  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1234480,1239679,problems or not lego group pulling the plug on  lego universe was nothing short of premature  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1239680,1244240,much like their rushed launch lego universe just  tragically wasn't given enough time to turn things  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1244240,1250640,around or build on their momentum lego universe  would officially shut down january 31st 2012  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1250640,1257360,just a few months after the launch of minecraft  which would go on to sell over 238 million copies  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1257360,1262880,yeah you heard that number right meanwhile  roblox a similar game we also mentioned with  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1262880,1268960,similar scripting elements present in lego  universe would sell 176 million copies ouch
cvBa6Dcws-4,1271360,1276720,six years later in jorgen vig nutstorp  the ceo of lego corp would say in 2018  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1276720,1280960,that he considered it one of his greatest  fiascos pulling the plug on lego universe  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1280960,1286320,too soon lego universe being shut down right  before the big minecraft and roblox boom  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1286320,1291440,was a tragedy for lego and fans alike and  the damn ceo even acknowledges it right  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1291440,1296159,because with how business works those two titles  greatly succeeding would have only helped lego  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1296160,1301360,universe which offered a different experience by  greatly expanding the market size in a weird way  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1301360,1307280,lego universe having launched unfinished was  too late and early at the same time to see the  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1307280,1312080,market explode to the levels it later did and to  have enough time in the oven to last post launch
cvBa6Dcws-4,1314160,1319120,like most mmo projects we cover on the death of a  game series when developers and publishers fail to  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1319120,1323200,keep the servers alive for players to enjoy which  is kind of promised on the agreement they make  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1323200,1328000,when you buy your game players in the community  are there to save the day if they only got more  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1328000,1333280,official support to do such like star wars  galaxy's emulator server or project 1999 lego  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1333280,1338240,universe dark flame and emulator would allow lego  universe to be playable online yet again though  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1338240,1342640,the dark flame team would reach out to lego group  concerning the legality of running such a server  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1342640,1347040,and in the end the communication would go dark  until abruptly dark flames team would announce  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1347040,1351920,that on october 2021 they would be releasing the  source code for their emulator but discontinuing  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1351920,1356800,the work on the project while it was sad news  that the negotiations didn't go too well at least  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1356800,1360720,the darkflame team had given the source code to  the community so they could still host their own  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1360720,1365200,private servers of lego universe and take place  in a part of history that was abruptly cut short  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1365200,1369120,it's not like legos aren't still worth billions  of dollars right there's still an audience  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1369120,1373600,that's why allowing the community to continue to  run the servers makes sense from a perspective of  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1373600,1379760,art preservation which we should all care greatly  about you can stick lego universe in a museum sure  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1379760,1384640,but without playable online servers you can never  actually experience what it means to play the game  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1384640,1389440,and what it meant to play the game even if there's  not an official supported capacity to still play  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1389440,1393679,lego universe for those watching at least you  still get a chance to go formulate your thoughts  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1393680,1396880,and enjoy the title if you missed it  in the short window that it lasted  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1398320,1402559,with lego universe officially shut down that means  we've reached the end of our timeline detectives  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1402560,1407760,and thus edged closer to solving this case for  good but before we get to our final deduction  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1407760,1411360,there's still some loosens i need to tie up  concerning lego universe and the reasons it  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1411360,1416000,failed as an mmo something i discovered that was  quite shocking about lego universe was how much  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1416000,1421520,money was spent on the game and how much of it  was dedicated to child safety chat controls alone  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1421520,1426720,lego universe had an impressive budget of  125 million and i want you detectives to get  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1426720,1433039,your guesses ready to imagine how much of that  was spent on child safety controls any guesses  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1433040,1438720,20 yep 25 million of the budget was spent  on making the game accessible for children  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1438720,1443200,the target audience through otter word  filtering moderation and more the system  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1443200,1447600,that the lego universe team developed to curb  harassment and worse was incredibly successful  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1447600,1452320,and incredibly expensive and time-consuming  thus it was a significant additional factor  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1452320,1457840,into the complications of developing lego  universe and thus why it suffered in some way  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1458880,1463360,while i enjoy lego growing up and still marvel  at the things that people are able to create  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1463360,1468640,with them as an adult aka yes i never grew  up i wasn't much of a lego builder savant  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1468640,1472400,nope i preferred watching back to back  episodes of sherlock and murder she wrote  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1472400,1476560,on tv instead which is why i'm here to do what  i'm actually good at solve a case so if you're  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1476560,1480560,hearing that music it means that that's tom's  way of letting everyone know that's exactly  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1480560,1485840,what we're going to do right now for the final  deduction on the death of a game lego universe  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1486560,1494000,not enough content required high-end machines the  game design just wasn't focused enough charged a  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1494000,1499280,sub in box fee while attempting to attract  a younger audience strenuous relationship  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1499280,1505360,with their parent company gazillion expensive  and time intensive child safe protocols crazy  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1505360,1513840,high expectations without the support to match  beat the out by minecraft not enough subscribers
cvBa6Dcws-4,1517440,1522879,the thought of being able to take everything that  you want in the lego universe no pun intended and  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1522880,1528640,make it come to life in a children's friendly mmo  is surely an impressive thought or vision even  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1528640,1534400,still today as lego still sits atop the biggest  toy company list the lego foray into the virtual  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1534400,1539120,realm might not have been the success that was  expected but it was a success nonetheless in a  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1539120,1544400,multitude of ways helping lego blocks reach the  virtual space in a way that they had never before  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1544400,1548960,has greatly increased the ability for all lego  enjoyers around the world to make better lego  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1548960,1553919,models so if you're a lego fan and never heard  of lego universe or don't care about it well you  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1553920,1559040,kind of should while titles like minecraft and  roblox would have their titan levels of success  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1559040,1563440,lego universe would go on to be remembered  as the other build em up kid focus game  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1563440,1570000,that could have been something had it been given  time a fateful tale of what could have been thanks  
cvBa6Dcws-4,1570000,1583840,for watching detectives built over a thousand  years it was meant to be a tower of dreams
cvBa6Dcws-4,1601520,1602020,you
