E9QYDRMVVMg,4200,6180,all right the workforce is shrinking at
E9QYDRMVVMg,6180,8160,coinbase and so are the offer letters
E9QYDRMVVMg,8160,10320,for supposed new hires as other workers
E9QYDRMVVMg,10320,12480,get laid off yeah we'll find it says Ali
E9QYDRMVVMg,12480,14040,garfinkel has been digging into this one
E9QYDRMVVMg,14040,15719,for us Ali
E9QYDRMVVMg,15719,17640,so I spoke to a worker from coinbase
E9QYDRMVVMg,17640,19800,who'd been laid off and it caught her
E9QYDRMVVMg,19800,22199,off guard Brian uh she actually was on
E9QYDRMVVMg,22199,23640,medical leave when she got an email
E9QYDRMVVMg,23640,26160,telling her that she'd been laid off and
E9QYDRMVVMg,26160,27599,it marks the end of what had started as
E9QYDRMVVMg,27599,29699,a really optimistic period in her career
E9QYDRMVVMg,29699,31500,you know she joined coinbase in 2020
E9QYDRMVVMg,31500,33540,right before the pandemic and she told
E9QYDRMVVMg,33540,34920,me it was the best interview process
E9QYDRMVVMg,34920,37320,she'd ever had and before it went remote
E9QYDRMVVMg,37320,38879,the other thing she said coinbase's
E9QYDRMVVMg,38879,40559,culture was amazing but she sort of
E9QYDRMVVMg,40559,42300,describes a shift after things went
E9QYDRMVVMg,42300,44280,remote you know she tensions were
E9QYDRMVVMg,44280,45780,escalating and she was feeling less and
E9QYDRMVVMg,45780,47640,less like the company was handling the
E9QYDRMVVMg,47640,49800,pandemic well so one of the most
E9QYDRMVVMg,49800,51300,striking things she told me when push
E9QYDRMVVMg,51300,53399,comes to shove Brian is that when she
E9QYDRMVVMg,53399,54840,was laid off she was scared of course
E9QYDRMVVMg,54840,57180,but she was also relieved the group of
E9QYDRMVVMg,57180,60059,people she was with actually cheered and
E9QYDRMVVMg,60059,61680,this is one person's experience of
E9QYDRMVVMg,61680,63180,course but I think it's an interesting
E9QYDRMVVMg,63180,65100,snapshot of what it's like getting laid
E9QYDRMVVMg,65100,67680,off right now wow okay so what makes
E9QYDRMVVMg,67680,69780,this round of tech layoffs different
E9QYDRMVVMg,69780,71640,from ones we've seen in the past yeah
E9QYDRMVVMg,71640,73560,that's a great question Brad and the
E9QYDRMVVMg,73560,74880,thing to take away about that is that
E9QYDRMVVMg,74880,77400,this is a macro economic story though
E9QYDRMVVMg,77400,79560,this wave of layoffs hitting companies
E9QYDRMVVMg,79560,81420,is about companies that are getting
E9QYDRMVVMg,81420,83700,slammed by Rising interest rates better
E9QYDRMVVMg,83700,86580,Robin Hood coinbase and this is sort of
E9QYDRMVVMg,86580,88200,actually a sharp contrast to the first
E9QYDRMVVMg,88200,90299,round of tech layoffs that we saw really
E9QYDRMVVMg,90299,92820,early in the pandemic I'm sure you guys
E9QYDRMVVMg,92820,94320,remember those layoffs were happening at
E9QYDRMVVMg,94320,95400,companies that had been massively
E9QYDRMVVMg,95400,97560,affected by shelter in place you know
E9QYDRMVVMg,97560,100619,TripAdvisor Airbnb Uber and that period
E9QYDRMVVMg,100619,102060,wasn't very long it was about three
E9QYDRMVVMg,102060,103200,months
E9QYDRMVVMg,103200,104399,um of course these two rounds are not
E9QYDRMVVMg,104399,105659,completely dissimilar they've both been
E9QYDRMVVMg,105659,107520,underscored by really difficult
E9QYDRMVVMg,107520,110100,fundraising environments but experts
E9QYDRMVVMg,110100,111540,I've been speaking to say that this wave
E9QYDRMVVMg,111540,114240,of tech layoffs is definitely distinct
E9QYDRMVVMg,114240,116520,I'm not so curious and sorry to put you
E9QYDRMVVMg,116520,118079,on the spot here are these people
E9QYDRMVVMg,118079,120659,finding new jobs and if they are how
E9QYDRMVVMg,120659,122700,quickly are they finding new jobs or are
E9QYDRMVVMg,122700,124500,they destined to now with the economy
E9QYDRMVVMg,124500,126060,slowing down be out of work for a while
E9QYDRMVVMg,126060,128039,you know it's actually that's a really
E9QYDRMVVMg,128039,129479,interesting question Julie for a couple
E9QYDRMVVMg,129479,131099,of reasons the first is you know people
E9QYDRMVVMg,131099,132480,are talking about this as similar to
E9QYDRMVVMg,132480,135120,the.com bust right and you know it's
E9QYDRMVVMg,135120,136620,similar in the way investor expectations
E9QYDRMVVMg,136620,139260,have been revamped but these people
E9QYDRMVVMg,139260,140879,actually are getting jobs and doing
E9QYDRMVVMg,140879,142020,interviews the worker I spoke to
E9QYDRMVVMg,142020,143340,actually had a bunch of interviews
E9QYDRMVVMg,143340,146040,scheduled for today for example and to
E9QYDRMVVMg,146040,147780,me like one of I asked an expert about
E9QYDRMVVMg,147780,149099,this as well and the thing that it
E9QYDRMVVMg,149099,151260,underscores is that Tech is still really
E9QYDRMVVMg,151260,153120,essential there are still opportunities
E9QYDRMVVMg,153120,155580,so it's a there's a math despite these
E9QYDRMVVMg,155580,157620,layoffs the reshuffle is happening
E9QYDRMVVMg,157620,159420,people are finding jobs interesting
E9QYDRMVVMg,159420,161519,really helpful insight Ali garfinkel
E9QYDRMVVMg,161519,164000,thanks so much
