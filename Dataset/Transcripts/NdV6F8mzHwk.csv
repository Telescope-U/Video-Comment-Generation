NdV6F8mzHwk,7040,7359,hey
NdV6F8mzHwk,7359,10480,it's me today i am doing another testing
NdV6F8mzHwk,10480,10960,art
NdV6F8mzHwk,10960,13920,trends that i've missed why did i miss a
NdV6F8mzHwk,13920,15040,bunch of art trends
NdV6F8mzHwk,15040,17279,well i always miss trends because i'm
NdV6F8mzHwk,17279,18640,always so distracted
NdV6F8mzHwk,18640,19760,there have been a lot of trends that
NdV6F8mzHwk,19760,22000,have gone by that i've noticed but just
NdV6F8mzHwk,22000,24400,not had time for or not been interested
NdV6F8mzHwk,24400,26400,in at the time that they were trending
NdV6F8mzHwk,26400,28560,or maybe i got sick of them because they
NdV6F8mzHwk,28560,30640,were so trendy i just got tired of
NdV6F8mzHwk,30640,31279,seeing them
NdV6F8mzHwk,31279,33120,now that all these trends are dead
NdV6F8mzHwk,33120,36718,there's a few that i want to try
NdV6F8mzHwk,36880,41120,that's what i do in this series
NdV6F8mzHwk,41520,44640,and i'm hot why am i hot oh that's cold
NdV6F8mzHwk,44640,47760,this time i'm trying pancake art i've
NdV6F8mzHwk,47760,50320,never tried pancake art in my life
NdV6F8mzHwk,50320,52399,one time i tried to pour a pancake in
NdV6F8mzHwk,52399,54000,the shape of a heart that didn't turn
NdV6F8mzHwk,54000,54559,out well
NdV6F8mzHwk,54559,56719,never tried it again i have a really
NdV6F8mzHwk,56719,58000,really bad track record
NdV6F8mzHwk,58000,61760,with making art out of food
NdV6F8mzHwk,61760,64960,oh gosh
NdV6F8mzHwk,66960,69760,um really really bad i don't know why i
NdV6F8mzHwk,69760,70159,keep
NdV6F8mzHwk,70159,72320,trying this i mean it just seems like a
NdV6F8mzHwk,72320,74479,good idea it's two of my favorite things
NdV6F8mzHwk,74479,74960,art
NdV6F8mzHwk,74960,77520,and food merged it's art that you can
NdV6F8mzHwk,77520,79520,eat it's food that you can art it just
NdV6F8mzHwk,79520,81840,never seems to go very well for me
NdV6F8mzHwk,81840,84400,if you miss the whole pancake art trend
NdV6F8mzHwk,84400,85360,basically
NdV6F8mzHwk,85360,88080,you just make pancake batter you color
NdV6F8mzHwk,88080,89600,it in a whole bunch of different colors
NdV6F8mzHwk,89600,90240,and then
NdV6F8mzHwk,90240,92799,use these little bottles you draw with
NdV6F8mzHwk,92799,94479,the pancake batter using these little
NdV6F8mzHwk,94479,97280,bottles it's like
NdV6F8mzHwk,97680,99280,really not like anything that i can
NdV6F8mzHwk,99280,101840,think of
NdV6F8mzHwk,104799,107200,that was disgusting so i believe i have
NdV6F8mzHwk,107200,109040,gathered everything that i need
NdV6F8mzHwk,109040,112799,for this experience uh
NdV6F8mzHwk,112799,115890,let me check recipe
NdV6F8mzHwk,115890,117680,[Music]
NdV6F8mzHwk,117680,120159,um okay hello it's gonna make the audio
NdV6F8mzHwk,120159,121840,sound really weird i'm pretty sure but
NdV6F8mzHwk,121840,122560,that's okay
NdV6F8mzHwk,122560,125360,phase one obviously is to make the
NdV6F8mzHwk,125360,127280,pancake batter i feel very
NdV6F8mzHwk,127280,129840,weird about baking in this location or
NdV6F8mzHwk,129840,130319,cooking
NdV6F8mzHwk,130319,133360,yeah you cook pancakes it's fine
NdV6F8mzHwk,133360,137120,now this recipe makes
NdV6F8mzHwk,137120,139440,eight servings does that mean eight
NdV6F8mzHwk,139440,141440,pancakes or are we being generous and
NdV6F8mzHwk,141440,142720,we've given everyone seconds
NdV6F8mzHwk,142720,144480,i think i might need a little bit more
NdV6F8mzHwk,144480,146239,than that especially considering how
NdV6F8mzHwk,146239,148080,many different colors i want to make
NdV6F8mzHwk,148080,150720,we're gonna triple it let's see it says
NdV6F8mzHwk,150720,151200,sift
NdV6F8mzHwk,151200,153840,together the flower so i did bring this
NdV6F8mzHwk,153840,156560,this flower says pre-sifted is that real
NdV6F8mzHwk,156560,159280,i trust you we don't need to save
NdV6F8mzHwk,159280,160959,nothing so we need three
NdV6F8mzHwk,160959,164000,cups oh oh oh boy one
NdV6F8mzHwk,164000,167280,two three thank you all right what's
NdV6F8mzHwk,167280,168959,next
NdV6F8mzHwk,168959,173280,baking powder we're tripling this so
NdV6F8mzHwk,173280,176480,seven teaspoons of baking powder one
NdV6F8mzHwk,176480,179840,two three four five six
NdV6F8mzHwk,179840,183120,seven side note i have since learned
NdV6F8mzHwk,183120,184959,that when you're multiplying a recipe
NdV6F8mzHwk,184959,186800,you may not need to increase the baking
NdV6F8mzHwk,186800,187519,powder at
NdV6F8mzHwk,187519,189680,all since too much baking powder can
NdV6F8mzHwk,189680,190560,mess things up
NdV6F8mzHwk,190560,192480,so this was not the right thing to do
NdV6F8mzHwk,192480,195200,wow this seems like a lot
NdV6F8mzHwk,195200,198560,oh okay now what three teaspoons of salt
NdV6F8mzHwk,198560,201760,one two three three tablespoons of white
NdV6F8mzHwk,201760,202480,sugar
NdV6F8mzHwk,202480,205840,one two three wonderful mix them
NdV6F8mzHwk,205840,206640,together
NdV6F8mzHwk,206640,210400,and now we switch our dry ingredients
NdV6F8mzHwk,210400,213040,for our wet ingredients i melted the
NdV6F8mzHwk,213040,214959,butter but it's been sitting down here
NdV6F8mzHwk,214959,216239,since i started recording
NdV6F8mzHwk,216239,219280,and it has solidified so
NdV6F8mzHwk,219280,227840,uh pour in the milk milk
NdV6F8mzHwk,228640,232159,okay three eggs
NdV6F8mzHwk,234319,238239,and all the butter
NdV6F8mzHwk,238239,241840,mix that all together
NdV6F8mzHwk,244319,247439,so i've mixed it up it is quite lumpy
NdV6F8mzHwk,247439,249280,um don't know if that's from the flour
NdV6F8mzHwk,249280,251280,or the butter
NdV6F8mzHwk,251280,253360,that wasn't completely melted i think
NdV6F8mzHwk,253360,255439,what we want is a nice
NdV6F8mzHwk,255439,258000,thin batter and this is a little on the
NdV6F8mzHwk,258000,260079,thick side
NdV6F8mzHwk,260079,262880,we're gonna add a little bit more milk
NdV6F8mzHwk,262880,263360,nice
NdV6F8mzHwk,263360,265759,and thin i think that's thin enough is
NdV6F8mzHwk,265759,266960,that too thin
NdV6F8mzHwk,266960,269840,let's just add a little bit of flour i
NdV6F8mzHwk,269840,270560,always over
NdV6F8mzHwk,270560,272800,correct and then i try to correct my
NdV6F8mzHwk,272800,274639,over correction by over correcting
NdV6F8mzHwk,274639,276320,i read online that it's supposed to be
NdV6F8mzHwk,276320,278160,the consistency of runny
NdV6F8mzHwk,278160,280720,ketchup but that's very unhelpful to me
NdV6F8mzHwk,280720,281600,because
NdV6F8mzHwk,281600,284080,like how how am i i don't what does that
NdV6F8mzHwk,284080,285680,even mean i know what the consistency of
NdV6F8mzHwk,285680,287759,regular ketchup is but you're modifying
NdV6F8mzHwk,287759,289040,the consistency of something that's
NdV6F8mzHwk,289040,289520,known
NdV6F8mzHwk,289520,291759,and it's still an unknown consistency so
NdV6F8mzHwk,291759,292880,how is that helpful
NdV6F8mzHwk,292880,295840,this could be runny ketchup pretty runny
NdV6F8mzHwk,295840,296800,i guess
NdV6F8mzHwk,296800,298560,every video i've seen of somebody doing
NdV6F8mzHwk,298560,300080,pancake art they just like
NdV6F8mzHwk,300080,302160,start with the pancake batter already
NdV6F8mzHwk,302160,303680,made i don't know why
NdV6F8mzHwk,303680,307039,i feel like this is part of the process
NdV6F8mzHwk,307039,309600,now it's time to color it but wait let's
NdV6F8mzHwk,309600,311280,take a break from that because this

NdV6F8mzHwk,386240,389600,now back to pancake art so i have all my
NdV6F8mzHwk,389600,390639,colors here
NdV6F8mzHwk,390639,395840,and then i got
NdV6F8mzHwk,395919,398960,oh okay i have all these squeeze bottles
NdV6F8mzHwk,398960,401600,minus one because jordan stole one for
NdV6F8mzHwk,401600,402639,cooking purposes
NdV6F8mzHwk,402639,405039,i'm going to put each different color in
NdV6F8mzHwk,405039,406240,how many different colors can we have
NdV6F8mzHwk,406240,407199,one two three four
NdV6F8mzHwk,407199,409440,five six seven eight nine ten eleven
NdV6F8mzHwk,409440,410720,eleven different colors
NdV6F8mzHwk,410720,412479,could have had twelve you blame jordan
NdV6F8mzHwk,412479,414000,for that and i got a
NdV6F8mzHwk,414000,416880,funnel because i figured transferring
NdV6F8mzHwk,416880,417599,the batter
NdV6F8mzHwk,417599,419919,into this little bottle would be easier
NdV6F8mzHwk,419919,420960,with a funnel so
NdV6F8mzHwk,420960,423759,let's get started it's time for you to
NdV6F8mzHwk,423759,424639,die
NdV6F8mzHwk,424639,436220,let's do it
NdV6F8mzHwk,436220,460940,[Music]
NdV6F8mzHwk,463280,466639,okay and we're back oh it took me
NdV6F8mzHwk,466639,469680,a full hour just to color all the batter
NdV6F8mzHwk,469680,470000,and
NdV6F8mzHwk,470000,472160,separate it i hope that the fun part has
NdV6F8mzHwk,472160,474240,yet to come because that was not fun i
NdV6F8mzHwk,474240,474720,used
NdV6F8mzHwk,474720,477599,every drop of batter that i had most of
NdV6F8mzHwk,477599,478080,them are
NdV6F8mzHwk,478080,482560,halfway full and and and
NdV6F8mzHwk,483280,486479,hello this one just farted its lid off
NdV6F8mzHwk,486479,489039,also i'm really scared because this
NdV6F8mzHwk,489039,491680,batter is super chunky you can see
NdV6F8mzHwk,491680,494400,the chunks of butter i feel like i'm
NdV6F8mzHwk,494400,495680,behind a wall
NdV6F8mzHwk,495680,499520,right now i have here a griddle pan
NdV6F8mzHwk,499520,502000,things are gonna get a little hot and
NdV6F8mzHwk,502000,503360,toasty
NdV6F8mzHwk,503360,506400,smells weird that smells toxic have it
NdV6F8mzHwk,506400,507759,at the lowest setting because we
NdV6F8mzHwk,507759,509759,definitely don't want our babies to burn
NdV6F8mzHwk,509759,512240,a little butter on there oh it's hot
NdV6F8mzHwk,512240,513200,okay whatever
NdV6F8mzHwk,513200,515599,okay the thing about pancake art is you
NdV6F8mzHwk,515599,516800,do the details
NdV6F8mzHwk,516800,519680,first and then you kind of layer it to
NdV6F8mzHwk,519680,520560,the background
NdV6F8mzHwk,520560,522399,obviously the reverse of how you would
NdV6F8mzHwk,522399,523680,paint something so
NdV6F8mzHwk,523680,527279,start with okay
NdV6F8mzHwk,527279,529680,okay it's hot start with a little
NdV6F8mzHwk,529680,532320,outline
NdV6F8mzHwk,532839,534480,okay
NdV6F8mzHwk,534480,536720,what the heck i think i just got pancake
NdV6F8mzHwk,536720,539920,batter on my ceiling
NdV6F8mzHwk,540320,543519,uh oh a chunk a chunk in here
NdV6F8mzHwk,543519,549070,oh no oh no
NdV6F8mzHwk,549070,551680,[Music]

NdV6F8mzHwk,560839,562720,whoops
NdV6F8mzHwk,562720,564880,okay that's what i've done crank up the
NdV6F8mzHwk,564880,566560,heat and let this baby
NdV6F8mzHwk,566560,569120,cook doesn't look like any pancake that
NdV6F8mzHwk,569120,569680,i've ever
NdV6F8mzHwk,569680,573519,made before okay i'm gonna flip it
NdV6F8mzHwk,573519,578320,bam honey hey it's kind of cute
NdV6F8mzHwk,578320,581279,it's very holy why isn't it like smooth
NdV6F8mzHwk,581279,582720,like a normal pancake
NdV6F8mzHwk,582720,584880,what did i do you added way too much
NdV6F8mzHwk,584880,585760,baking powder
NdV6F8mzHwk,585760,588720,it looks like a strawberry rug i'm fine
NdV6F8mzHwk,588720,589360,with it
NdV6F8mzHwk,589360,591680,i'm a fan of this kind of making food
NdV6F8mzHwk,591680,594880,with food let me try this again
NdV6F8mzHwk,594880,597680,oh gosh this is not the right color oh
NdV6F8mzHwk,597680,599760,shoot i should turn down the heat again
NdV6F8mzHwk,599760,602160,you don't want this to cook too fast let
NdV6F8mzHwk,602160,602800,me take
NdV6F8mzHwk,602800,606720,all the tops off oh
NdV6F8mzHwk,607120,611760,why there's batter everywhere
NdV6F8mzHwk,612960,616200,[Music]
NdV6F8mzHwk,617600,623040,there it is i think it's ready to flip
NdV6F8mzHwk,625360,628240,okay all right not super happy with the
NdV6F8mzHwk,628240,630079,look of those sprinkles
NdV6F8mzHwk,630079,632320,those are kind of a disgrace but you get
NdV6F8mzHwk,632320,633920,the idea what do we think
NdV6F8mzHwk,633920,635760,i think they're kind of cute i guess i'm
NdV6F8mzHwk,635760,637440,just gonna keep on doing this until i
NdV6F8mzHwk,637440,647839,run out of batter i don't know

NdV6F8mzHwk,654480,656240,tipping i didn't do it on purpose
NdV6F8mzHwk,656240,658079,definitely did not but i kind of like it
NdV6F8mzHwk,658079,659519,i feel like i need to try something
NdV6F8mzHwk,659519,661839,different now i'm gonna try something a
NdV6F8mzHwk,661839,662800,little ambitious
NdV6F8mzHwk,662800,665040,i want to do georgie but this is
NdV6F8mzHwk,665040,666640,probably going to suck
NdV6F8mzHwk,666640,674480,start with his face okay okay
NdV6F8mzHwk,674480,680399,[Music]
NdV6F8mzHwk,680399,684320,we ready for the georgie flip oh
NdV6F8mzHwk,684320,688240,oh that is so ugly he is in pancake form
NdV6F8mzHwk,688240,690320,so i think we can forgive it hey from a
NdV6F8mzHwk,690320,691920,distance it kind of looks cute
NdV6F8mzHwk,691920,702130,what if i did a landscape
NdV6F8mzHwk,702130,703360,[Music]
NdV6F8mzHwk,703360,706560,okay that's kind of dumb
NdV6F8mzHwk,706560,708079,it's kind of dumb yeah that's kind of
NdV6F8mzHwk,708079,710079,dumb well i'm starting to get pancake
NdV6F8mzHwk,710079,711279,art fatigue
NdV6F8mzHwk,711279,712959,i do still have quite a bit of batter
NdV6F8mzHwk,712959,714399,left there's only one
NdV6F8mzHwk,714399,718560,reasonable thing to do abstract pancake
NdV6F8mzHwk,718560,719120,art
NdV6F8mzHwk,719120,719810,of course
NdV6F8mzHwk,719810,724079,[Music]
NdV6F8mzHwk,724079,726079,why is there a big black smudge on it
NdV6F8mzHwk,726079,729279,they just get worse and worse
NdV6F8mzHwk,729279,732079,i got my pancakes here syrup i think i
NdV6F8mzHwk,732079,733360,have to at least eat
NdV6F8mzHwk,733360,735360,one who should i eat georgie i think
NdV6F8mzHwk,735360,738160,i'll eat georgie
NdV6F8mzHwk,739120,745839,so aesthetic
NdV6F8mzHwk,748079,752399,tastes like a cold dense pancake
NdV6F8mzHwk,754079,756839,i just ate a lot of dye well georgie's
NdV6F8mzHwk,756839,758160,gone
NdV6F8mzHwk,758160,761279,now i feel more hungry landscape
NdV6F8mzHwk,761279,763680,anyway it's reflection time what do i
NdV6F8mzHwk,763680,765440,feel about pancake art uh
NdV6F8mzHwk,765440,768160,i feel like the prep is outrageous
NdV6F8mzHwk,768160,770320,making an enormous amount of batter
NdV6F8mzHwk,770320,772480,coloring the batter and then putting it
NdV6F8mzHwk,772480,773760,in all the bottles
NdV6F8mzHwk,773760,775440,by the time i was done with that i was
NdV6F8mzHwk,775440,777760,just like ugh it's just a lot of work to
NdV6F8mzHwk,777760,779200,go through to for something that you're
NdV6F8mzHwk,779200,780639,just gonna eat i don't know if it's
NdV6F8mzHwk,780639,781360,worth it
NdV6F8mzHwk,781360,784399,did i hate it no it's just not really my
NdV6F8mzHwk,784399,786720,thing it's not a love connection i think
NdV6F8mzHwk,786720,788880,it looks a lot more fun than it actually
NdV6F8mzHwk,788880,790959,is especially when you cut out all the
NdV6F8mzHwk,790959,793040,cleanup it's not all it's cracked up to
NdV6F8mzHwk,793040,794480,be really i hope that you guys were
NdV6F8mzHwk,794480,796560,entertained by it at the very least
