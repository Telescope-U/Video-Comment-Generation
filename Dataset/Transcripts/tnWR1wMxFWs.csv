tnWR1wMxFWs,1360,3520,There's people in here that  are far superior than me.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,4560,6560,But there's no one in here that's  gonna work harder than me.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,8160,10880,"You get up at 5:30 in the morning, it's p*ssing rain outside,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,10880,16240,"our competition is sleeping, I love that. I will not be outworked.  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,16240,18160,Period. Where I excel  
tnWR1wMxFWs,18800,21439,"is ridiculous,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,22080,25600,"sickening work ethic. While the other guy's sleeping,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,26240,28160,"I'm working. While the other guy's eating,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,28880,31199,"I'm working. Talent you have naturally,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,31200,35520,skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours  
tnWR1wMxFWs,35520,39840,"of beating on your craft. The commodity, the majority of people  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,39840,44160,"who aren't achieving the things that they want, is strictly  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,44160,47200,"based on hustle. Is strictly based on being outworked,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,47200,51120,is strictly based on missing crucial opportunities.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,51120,54719,"You might outwork me for 30  days, or 60 days, or 90 days,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,54720,58240,but you ain't gonna beat me over a year. You can't outwork me over 2 years.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,58240,60800,"I'm gonna get you eventually, I'm a dripping damn faucet,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,60800,64640,I just keep coming at you. I'm too damn tough to give up.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,64640,68000,Most people half-ass half their life all the time.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,68000,70400,"I knew they were gonna get tired, they were gonna get down,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,70400,73040,"they quit improving themselves, they start sleeping in,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,73040,75040,"I'm not gonna do that stuff,  I'm gonna get up early,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,75040,77040,"I'm gonna keep getting wide, I'm gonna stay relentless.  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,78560,80880,"I might not be the fastest,  the strongest, the smartest,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,80880,83040,"none of that crap, but I will outwork your ass  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,83040,86480,and I flat-out want it more than you. It's relentlessness man.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,86480,89440,"It's pushing past barriers, it's every time you get somewhere,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,89440,92960,it's wanting to go to the next level. You guys aren't entitled to sh*t.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,92960,95840,What you're entitled to is an opportunity  
tnWR1wMxFWs,95840,99280,"to show up and be your best. Everyone's like, oh Greg, you're lucky,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,99280,100479,"you got this, Greg, you're lucky, everything  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,100480,101840,you do is luck. Bullsh*t.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,101840,104399,"'Cause before it was luck, it was a belief.  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,104400,107440,"And every day with no one  watching at 5 in the morning,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,107440,109280,"by myself, I trained it,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,109280,111760,'cause I believed in it. In hopes that one day  
tnWR1wMxFWs,111760,113920,my trained ability collided  
tnWR1wMxFWs,113920,117200,with an opportunity to show it off. That's what luck is.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,117200,120719,That's what success is. Nothing subjective in there.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,120720,123280,"It's all you. You gotta look at how much you're working,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,123280,126400,"you gotta look at how much effort you're making, the intention you're putting out there.  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,126400,130160,You gotta cross the line in life. You gotta go where nobody else wants to go.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,130160,132560,You gotta work the hours  nobody else wants the hours.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,132560,135920,You have to resolve yourself today that you're going to dominate.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,135920,138480,That you're not average and ordinary. There has to become a point where  
tnWR1wMxFWs,138480,140800,"you make a decision, we're going to dominate.  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,140800,143280,We're here to win. We are not here to play.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,143280,146400,And that takes some intestinal fortitude. I'm where I'm at  
tnWR1wMxFWs,146400,150640,"'cause I just flat decided I'm gonna be a player. I decided at some point,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,150640,154000,I get to choose who I am. The world doesn't tell me who I am.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,154000,156800,"I write these chapters. You don't need the world's permission,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,156800,159360,you don't need anyone's f*cking  permission to be great.  
tnWR1wMxFWs,159360,162160,The only permission you need is from that motherf*cker  
tnWR1wMxFWs,162160,166800,"who stares at you back in the mirror every day, and a willingness to do the hard f*cking work  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,166800,167840,"longer, harder,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,167840,170160,and better than anyone. So what are you gonna do?  
tnWR1wMxFWs,170160,174720,"Are you gonna buy another success program, looking for the secret recipe that doesn't exist?  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,174720,177200,"Or are you gonna go do  something right f*cking now,  "
tnWR1wMxFWs,177920,180080,and do something that brings  you closer to greatness?  
tnWR1wMxFWs,180720,183840,That's your choice.
