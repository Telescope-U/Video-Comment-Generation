mE4akkdigDk,3199,5040,the world welcome we begin the day with
mE4akkdigDk,5040,7200,the war in ukraine an improving picture
mE4akkdigDk,7200,9760,for russia a picture of problems for the
mE4akkdigDk,9760,12639,west last week ukrainian forces suffered
mE4akkdigDk,12639,14719,a major loss in the east of the country
mE4akkdigDk,14719,16800,retreating from the city of seville
mE4akkdigDk,16800,19199,donetsk tonight russian forces are
mE4akkdigDk,19199,21680,clearly advancing closer to their goal
mE4akkdigDk,21680,23760,of taking the entire eastern region
mE4akkdigDk,23760,26000,which is known as the donbass
mE4akkdigDk,26000,28080,a tentative sense of calm that had
mE4akkdigDk,28080,30080,returned to other parts of ukraine was
mE4akkdigDk,30080,32238,blown away over the weekend for the
mE4akkdigDk,32238,34320,first time in weeks russian rockets hit
mE4akkdigDk,34320,36800,the capital kiev in the western city of
mE4akkdigDk,36800,39600,levive rocket attacks sent off air raid
mE4akkdigDk,39600,42719,sirens five times in just 48
mE4akkdigDk,42719,46079,hours now this comes as leaders meeting
mE4akkdigDk,46079,48239,at the g7 summit here in germany face a
mE4akkdigDk,48239,50719,double dilemma western sanctions against
mE4akkdigDk,50719,52719,russia are not denying putin the money
mE4akkdigDk,52719,55520,that he needs to bankroll his war at the
mE4akkdigDk,55520,57360,same time the sanctions are fueling
mE4akkdigDk,57360,60640,global inflation voters in g7 countries
mE4akkdigDk,60640,63520,are staring at cost of living hikes not
mE4akkdigDk,63520,65840,seen in 40 years
mE4akkdigDk,65840,67920,behind closed doors at the summit the
mE4akkdigDk,67920,70560,motto may have been something's got to
mE4akkdigDk,70560,71600,give
mE4akkdigDk,71600,73840,how much longer will voters support
mE4akkdigDk,73840,76240,supporting ukraine while their own
mE4akkdigDk,76240,79280,buying power at home shrinks by the day
mE4akkdigDk,79280,80720,we'll try to get some answers in just a
mE4akkdigDk,80720,82720,moment but first this report from the
mE4akkdigDk,82720,86439,bavarian alps
mE4akkdigDk,87200,89759,at this luxury hotel nestled in the
mE4akkdigDk,89759,92960,bavarian alps talk of war is dominating
mE4akkdigDk,92960,95759,discussions at this year's g7 summit
mE4akkdigDk,95759,98640,specifically options to support ukraine
mE4akkdigDk,98640,102240,and expand sanctions on russia
mE4akkdigDk,102240,104720,in a closed door session via video link
mE4akkdigDk,104720,107119,ukraine's president asked world leaders
mE4akkdigDk,107119,109680,to help end the war before winter when
mE4akkdigDk,109680,111920,conditions would become tougher for his
mE4akkdigDk,111920,114920,troops
mE4akkdigDk,116880,118159,we all have assured that we will
mE4akkdigDk,118159,119920,continue to support ukraine in its
mE4akkdigDk,119920,122240,defense against russia
mE4akkdigDk,122240,124880,what's clear is that war is a deep deep
mE4akkdigDk,124880,128720,cut in international relations
mE4akkdigDk,128720,130560,all the rules all the agreements that we
mE4akkdigDk,130560,132480,have made with each other
mE4akkdigDk,132480,134560,the cooperation of states all has been
mE4akkdigDk,134560,135920,broken
mE4akkdigDk,135920,137280,especially the understanding that
mE4akkdigDk,137280,141879,borders should not be moved by forces
mE4akkdigDk,143920,146400,the g7 is considering capping russian
mE4akkdigDk,146400,148959,oil prices and imposing sanctions on
mE4akkdigDk,148959,151599,gold exports as a way to further target
mE4akkdigDk,151599,154400,vladimir putin's revenue streams while
mE4akkdigDk,154400,157280,minimizing spillover effects the war is
mE4akkdigDk,157280,159760,already driving up food and fuel prices
mE4akkdigDk,159760,161920,around the world as well as inflation
mE4akkdigDk,161920,164239,rates several developing economies have
mE4akkdigDk,164239,166080,been invited to take part in this year's
mE4akkdigDk,166080,168400,summit joining working groups focused on
mE4akkdigDk,168400,171840,energy and food security
mE4akkdigDk,171840,173360,well for more now we want to bring in
mE4akkdigDk,173360,175440,anastasia fedex she is a member of
mE4akkdigDk,175440,177599,economist for ukraine which is a
mE4akkdigDk,177599,179599,worldwide collective working to support
mE4akkdigDk,179599,181760,ukraine and to end russia's invasion
mE4akkdigDk,181760,183760,she's also an assistant professor of
mE4akkdigDk,183760,185599,finance at the university of california
mE4akkdigDk,185599,187200,in berkeley professor it's good to have
mE4akkdigDk,187200,188400,you back on
mE4akkdigDk,188400,191040,the day i i want to discuss first the
mE4akkdigDk,191040,193440,plan that came out of this g7
mE4akkdigDk,193440,196239,summit the plan to hurt putin
mE4akkdigDk,196239,198640,where it hurts the most the u.s says
mE4akkdigDk,198640,201120,that the g7 is going to put a price cap
mE4akkdigDk,201120,203200,on russian oil
mE4akkdigDk,203200,206000,is that going to work
mE4akkdigDk,206000,208319,yes um absolutely the price cap is
mE4akkdigDk,208319,210159,something that i think is effective that
mE4akkdigDk,210159,212159,is necessary and honestly is long
mE4akkdigDk,212159,214239,overdue um so our group of economists
mE4akkdigDk,214239,216400,has been pushing for a price cap for
mE4akkdigDk,216400,219280,about a couple of months now um it
mE4akkdigDk,219280,220959,should have been there when the eu was
mE4akkdigDk,220959,222640,discussing the fixed package of
mE4akkdigDk,222640,224799,sanctions as energy prices were rising
mE4akkdigDk,224799,226640,up what we're debating what will and
mE4akkdigDk,226640,228720,will not happen um and it still can be
mE4akkdigDk,228720,230799,effective now and the idea is that the
mE4akkdigDk,230799,233280,price cap would be able to limit the
mE4akkdigDk,233280,235439,cash that putin is receiving for energy
mE4akkdigDk,235439,238480,without damaging the global supply and
mE4akkdigDk,238480,240319,it's something that even um kind of
mE4akkdigDk,240319,242319,third-party or by-sender countries can
mE4akkdigDk,242319,244319,more easily go along with um because the
mE4akkdigDk,244319,247360,eu is paying only say 50 euros per
mE4akkdigDk,247360,249599,barrel would india really be paying 70
mE4akkdigDk,249599,251519,no they wouldn't so that's going to
mE4akkdigDk,251519,255200,allow china and india to continue buying
mE4akkdigDk,255200,257840,russian oil correctly who gets to
mE4akkdigDk,257840,261600,decide that what the price cap is
mE4akkdigDk,261680,263520,yeah so of course the larger the
mE4akkdigDk,263520,265040,collective of countries that sign up to
mE4akkdigDk,265040,266320,the price cap the more effective it's
mE4akkdigDk,266320,268400,going to be but even if it's not
mE4akkdigDk,268400,269680,everybody that is explicitly
mE4akkdigDk,269680,271199,implementing the price cap if it's a
mE4akkdigDk,271199,273280,large enough part of the world that is
mE4akkdigDk,273280,275199,implementing price cap the other
mE4akkdigDk,275199,276479,countries will have more bargaining
mE4akkdigDk,276479,279199,power to pay lower prices for oil even
mE4akkdigDk,279199,280639,if they're slightly higher than
mE4akkdigDk,280639,282320,potentially that
mE4akkdigDk,282320,285280,um do you agree with me when i say that
mE4akkdigDk,285280,286880,the the sanctions
mE4akkdigDk,286880,288639,as they have been applied so far since
mE4akkdigDk,288639,290800,the beginning of this invasion they have
mE4akkdigDk,290800,294080,not had the desired effect
mE4akkdigDk,294080,295600,the desired effect no of course they
mE4akkdigDk,295600,298000,have had an effect um we do see that the
mE4akkdigDk,298000,300000,russian economy is contracting quite a
mE4akkdigDk,300000,302639,bit um we of course see how frustrated
mE4akkdigDk,302639,305600,russians from oligarchs to propagandists
mE4akkdigDk,305600,306960,are about the western sanctions they
mE4akkdigDk,306960,308960,complain a lot about them there they
mE4akkdigDk,308960,311199,launch lawsuits to get out from them um
mE4akkdigDk,311199,314400,so it has had an effect it has not had
mE4akkdigDk,314400,317280,the desired effect meaning it has not um
mE4akkdigDk,317280,320000,taken away either russia's desire to
mE4akkdigDk,320000,322160,wage the war or its ability to wage the
mE4akkdigDk,322160,323840,war
mE4akkdigDk,323840,325680,i'm sure are aware that the white house
mE4akkdigDk,325680,328880,has said that russia defaulted
mE4akkdigDk,328880,331360,on um a bond bill that it was supposed
mE4akkdigDk,331360,332240,to pay
mE4akkdigDk,332240,335280,by yesterday now the kremlin has denied
mE4akkdigDk,335280,336639,that
mE4akkdigDk,336639,339039,what effect though we assume it's true
mE4akkdigDk,339039,343199,what effect would a russian default have
mE4akkdigDk,343199,345199,so the main effect of sovereign default
mE4akkdigDk,345199,348560,in general is limiting or outright um
mE4akkdigDk,348560,351840,removing the ability of that country to
mE4akkdigDk,351840,354080,borrow in the future right so just not a
mE4akkdigDk,354080,356080,credible borrower people will not lend
mE4akkdigDk,356080,358160,um so that that's the general effect now
mE4akkdigDk,358160,360639,in the case of russia unfortunately the
mE4akkdigDk,360639,362960,effect of the default is not going to be
mE4akkdigDk,362960,365680,that large why because russia's already
mE4akkdigDk,365680,367919,effectively cut off from most of the
mE4akkdigDk,367919,369919,western financial system
mE4akkdigDk,369919,372560,and autarky for russia lately has been
mE4akkdigDk,372560,374560,more of a feature than a bug
mE4akkdigDk,374560,377120,they're not that interdependent they're
mE4akkdigDk,377120,377840,on
mE4akkdigDk,377840,379520,deliberately
mE4akkdigDk,379520,382160,also reputational damage the default of
mE4akkdigDk,382160,384479,course is reputationally damaging but
mE4akkdigDk,384479,386240,not as much as the fact that russia is
mE4akkdigDk,386240,388800,waging a genocidal war um so from that
mE4akkdigDk,388800,390000,perspective
mE4akkdigDk,390000,392800,this particular default is not as big of
mE4akkdigDk,392800,395199,a deal as it would be otherwise
mE4akkdigDk,395199,398080,finance ministers from the g7 countries
mE4akkdigDk,398080,400800,they are providing 20 billion dollars in
mE4akkdigDk,400800,403280,economic aid to help ukraine
mE4akkdigDk,403280,405520,keep its basic services functioning
mE4akkdigDk,405520,407199,basically to pay public workers for
mE4akkdigDk,407199,409360,example what kind of commitment is
mE4akkdigDk,409360,411759,ukraine going to need long term do we
mE4akkdigDk,411759,414080,know
mE4akkdigDk,414080,416160,yeah so i think the current estimates um
mE4akkdigDk,416160,417759,in terms of how much we are we're going
mE4akkdigDk,417759,419280,to need um
mE4akkdigDk,419280,422080,in ukraine to reconstruct and to
mE4akkdigDk,422080,424080,continue to function or anywhere from
mE4akkdigDk,424080,426639,500 billion to a trillion dollars so it
mE4akkdigDk,426639,430080,is a large commitment um a long term and
mE4akkdigDk,430080,432000,at the same time you have to think about
mE4akkdigDk,432000,434160,the alternative um
mE4akkdigDk,434160,436080,ukraine is only able to continue
mE4akkdigDk,436080,438720,fighting the war um if it continues
mE4akkdigDk,438720,440960,being able to function and if we
mE4akkdigDk,440960,442639,actually imagine the alternative of
mE4akkdigDk,442639,444479,ukraine not being able to continue
mE4akkdigDk,444479,446560,fighting the war effectively becoming a
mE4akkdigDk,446560,449199,second belarus a country from which
mE4akkdigDk,449199,451680,russia can intimidate
mE4akkdigDk,451680,453919,others can launch attacks potentially on
mE4akkdigDk,453919,456400,others and moreover
mE4akkdigDk,456400,458639,if russia takes over the resources that
mE4akkdigDk,458639,460639,are in ukraine all of the issues that
mE4akkdigDk,460639,462800,we're having now would be exacerbated so
mE4akkdigDk,462800,464639,we're facing a food crisis now and
mE4akkdigDk,464639,467280,russia just blockading ukrainian grain
mE4akkdigDk,467280,469199,should russia actually take over all
mE4akkdigDk,469199,471199,that capacity for grain for energy
mE4akkdigDk,471199,472720,everything else in ukraine that
mE4akkdigDk,472720,475520,blackmail potential will just be greater
mE4akkdigDk,475520,477199,and establic
mE4akkdigDk,477199,479360,from economist for ukraine we appreciate
mE4akkdigDk,479360,480639,your time and your insights it's good to
mE4akkdigDk,480639,482639,see you again thank you
mE4akkdigDk,482639,485879,thank you
