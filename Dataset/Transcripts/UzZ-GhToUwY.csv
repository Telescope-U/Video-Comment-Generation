UzZ-GhToUwY,0,1760,so if you take a look at the last few
UzZ-GhToUwY,1760,4480,gpu generations there's more performance
UzZ-GhToUwY,4480,6560,but for a lot more power and a lot more
UzZ-GhToUwY,6560,7919,money and that doesn't look to be
UzZ-GhToUwY,7919,10400,changing for what's coming next today i
UzZ-GhToUwY,10400,12000,want to discuss some of the leaks that
UzZ-GhToUwY,12000,14160,have been popping up for the rtx 4000
UzZ-GhToUwY,14160,15759,series i've been getting a ton of
UzZ-GhToUwY,15759,18080,questions about thermal requirements the
UzZ-GhToUwY,18080,20160,huge power numbers that we're seeing and
UzZ-GhToUwY,20160,22160,just what this means in general for the
UzZ-GhToUwY,22160,24640,kind of pcs that i build and i kind of
UzZ-GhToUwY,24640,26320,lean towards now of course these are
UzZ-GhToUwY,26320,28400,just rumors and leaks you know stuff
UzZ-GhToUwY,28400,30320,that i don't typically report on but
UzZ-GhToUwY,30320,32160,they have been pretty consistent over
UzZ-GhToUwY,32160,34160,the past few months and they all point
UzZ-GhToUwY,34160,36640,in the same direction so i do think we
UzZ-GhToUwY,36640,38800,have a pretty confident sense of what's
UzZ-GhToUwY,38800,40640,going to happen in the next few months
UzZ-GhToUwY,40640,42399,you know maybe not down to the minute
UzZ-GhToUwY,42399,44079,details and specs but at least the
UzZ-GhToUwY,44079,46640,overall direction so let's start there
UzZ-GhToUwY,46640,48879,nvidia's rtx 4000 is rumored to be
UzZ-GhToUwY,48879,51360,running on a custom tsmc 4 nanometer
UzZ-GhToUwY,51360,54640,process appropriately named tsmc4n and
UzZ-GhToUwY,54640,56320,nextgen at this point we'll go under the
UzZ-GhToUwY,56320,58960,name ada lovelace now the number four in
UzZ-GhToUwY,58960,60640,four nanometer doesn't really tell us
UzZ-GhToUwY,60640,62719,much these days it doesn't refer to any
UzZ-GhToUwY,62719,64960,physical node pitch or measurement like
UzZ-GhToUwY,64960,66960,it used to but for what it's worth we
UzZ-GhToUwY,66960,69439,can definitely expect denser silicon and
UzZ-GhToUwY,69439,71600,naturally more transistors than ever in
UzZ-GhToUwY,71600,74000,a gaming gpu and as usual some of you
UzZ-GhToUwY,74000,75360,are probably tired of hearing me say
UzZ-GhToUwY,75360,76960,this but it's going to be the high-end
UzZ-GhToUwY,76960,80400,stuff coming out first so rtx 4090 4080
UzZ-GhToUwY,80400,82960,4070 is what is expected to be the first
UzZ-GhToUwY,82960,84640,three cards coming out to kind of kick
UzZ-GhToUwY,84640,87200,things off just as we had the 30 90 30
UzZ-GhToUwY,87200,90560,80 30 70 for the 30 series so if you're
UzZ-GhToUwY,90560,93600,looking forward to a 40 60 40 50
UzZ-GhToUwY,93600,95600,definitely don't expect those until next
UzZ-GhToUwY,95600,98159,year at least now surprisingly the rtx
UzZ-GhToUwY,98159,100720,4080 is expected to use a completely
UzZ-GhToUwY,100720,103280,different gpu to the 4090 this time
UzZ-GhToUwY,103280,105680,around not as with the 3080 which is
UzZ-GhToUwY,105680,108399,essentially a cut down 1390 both using
UzZ-GhToUwY,108399,111439,the ga102 gpu that's reflected in the
UzZ-GhToUwY,111439,113200,number of cuda cores separating them as
UzZ-GhToUwY,113200,114960,well as we've seen performance wise the
UzZ-GhToUwY,114960,117600,30 19 30 80 aren't that different but
UzZ-GhToUwY,117600,119280,this time around there's expected to be
UzZ-GhToUwY,119280,121360,a massive difference in compute power
UzZ-GhToUwY,121360,123920,between the 40 90 and 40 80. these leaks
UzZ-GhToUwY,123920,126640,from videocards.com suggest a colossal
UzZ-GhToUwY,126640,128800,60 increase in the number of streaming
UzZ-GhToUwY,128800,130800,multiprocessors and cuda cores over the
UzZ-GhToUwY,130800,134000,4080 not only that but a huge memory
UzZ-GhToUwY,134000,136720,uplift as well the 4090 is expected to
UzZ-GhToUwY,136720,138640,use the same memory configuration as
UzZ-GhToUwY,138640,141680,this generation's rtx 3090 ti whereas
UzZ-GhToUwY,141680,144080,the 4080 is expected to get a relative
UzZ-GhToUwY,144080,145760,downgrade now that would be very
UzZ-GhToUwY,145760,148239,surprising if true extremely unusual to
UzZ-GhToUwY,148239,150560,see a downgrade in video memory between
UzZ-GhToUwY,150560,153680,gpu generations but if 4080 performance
UzZ-GhToUwY,153680,155360,is higher than expected it does leave
UzZ-GhToUwY,155360,157200,room in the tank for nvidia to release
UzZ-GhToUwY,157200,160239,say a 4080 ti or a 4080 super with
UzZ-GhToUwY,160239,161920,primarily a juiced up memory
UzZ-GhToUwY,161920,164879,configuration as for the suggested 4070
UzZ-GhToUwY,164879,166400,it's about what you would expect
UzZ-GhToUwY,166400,168480,generous cuda core bump over the current
UzZ-GhToUwY,168480,171280,3070 with the gddr6 memory config
UzZ-GhToUwY,171280,173120,overall not looking too different
UzZ-GhToUwY,173120,174560,overall though it's looking pretty
UzZ-GhToUwY,174560,176080,interesting to kick things off if this
UzZ-GhToUwY,176080,177840,is how things are going to play out
UzZ-GhToUwY,177840,179599,there will be considerable performance
UzZ-GhToUwY,179599,181760,uplifts over current gen especially if
UzZ-GhToUwY,181760,184400,that rumored 4090 spec is accurate
UzZ-GhToUwY,184400,186400,although the quoted tdp and power
UzZ-GhToUwY,186400,188720,consumption numbers are a bit odd i mean
UzZ-GhToUwY,188720,190800,take a look at the 4090 for example for
UzZ-GhToUwY,190800,192800,such a huge increase in the amount of
UzZ-GhToUwY,192800,195519,silicon over the 4080 the 4090 will
UzZ-GhToUwY,195519,197920,definitely pull a bunch more power that
UzZ-GhToUwY,197920,199920,is unless the 4080 is running
UzZ-GhToUwY,199920,201840,considerably higher clock speeds which
UzZ-GhToUwY,201840,203920,are much less efficient but yeah i would
UzZ-GhToUwY,203920,206159,expect a lot more than 30 watts between
UzZ-GhToUwY,206159,208319,them but just how realistic though are
UzZ-GhToUwY,208319,210319,those expected power numbers i mean you
UzZ-GhToUwY,210319,211840,take a look at the 40 4090 and what
UzZ-GhToUwY,211840,214159,that's expected to pull that's plus 100
UzZ-GhToUwY,214159,216480,watts over the current 3090 and then you
UzZ-GhToUwY,216480,218879,know plus 100 watts again for the 4080
UzZ-GhToUwY,218879,221920,even the 4070 is plus 50 watts over the
UzZ-GhToUwY,221920,224720,current 3070. to be honest it's not too
UzZ-GhToUwY,224720,226720,unrealistic i mean you take a look at
UzZ-GhToUwY,226720,228560,what nvidia have invested to something
UzZ-GhToUwY,228560,231200,like this okay completely different you
UzZ-GhToUwY,231200,232640,know thermal design to what we were
UzZ-GhToUwY,232640,234959,using before much more you know dense
UzZ-GhToUwY,234959,237200,space efficient and power capable power
UzZ-GhToUwY,237200,238959,connectors putting two and two together
UzZ-GhToUwY,238959,240400,looking at what nvidia is currently
UzZ-GhToUwY,240400,242000,doing and also the pretty consistent
UzZ-GhToUwY,242000,244080,leaks i'd say that those expected power
UzZ-GhToUwY,244080,245840,numbers are pretty accurate and to be
UzZ-GhToUwY,245840,248239,honest if we see plus 500 watts plus
UzZ-GhToUwY,248239,250480,even maybe 600 watt gpus coming out in
UzZ-GhToUwY,250480,252400,the near future i would not be too
UzZ-GhToUwY,252400,254720,surprised i mean we already have evgas
UzZ-GhToUwY,254720,257600,for the win 3 30 80s for example which
UzZ-GhToUwY,257600,260400,has a v bias that can go up to 450 watts
UzZ-GhToUwY,260400,262000,and it can actually hit that their
UzZ-GhToUwY,262000,265919,390tis have v bios as well up to 550
UzZ-GhToUwY,265919,268400,watts again that's current gen that's
UzZ-GhToUwY,268400,271680,3090ti 3090 as well around the 500 watt
UzZ-GhToUwY,271680,272800,mark for some of these factory
UzZ-GhToUwY,272800,275360,overclocked aftermarket cards so looking
UzZ-GhToUwY,275360,276800,at these power numbers it's not too
UzZ-GhToUwY,276800,278479,unrealistic that we're going to kind of
UzZ-GhToUwY,278479,281040,see 4080s and 4090s probably hitting
UzZ-GhToUwY,281040,283600,that mark again upwards of 600 watts is
UzZ-GhToUwY,283600,285600,probably not unrealistic now with that
UzZ-GhToUwY,285600,287440,kind of power draw probably forget an
UzZ-GhToUwY,287440,289520,sfx power supply at least the ones that
UzZ-GhToUwY,289520,291199,are out there on the market today
UzZ-GhToUwY,291199,292960,popular enthusiast models like the
UzZ-GhToUwY,292960,295199,corsair sf750 platinum which have
UzZ-GhToUwY,295199,298080,survived like an rtx 3090 no problem
UzZ-GhToUwY,298080,300000,they will finally meet their maker if
UzZ-GhToUwY,300000,302320,we're talking about 600 watt gpus and
UzZ-GhToUwY,302320,304560,you'll likely need some serious gpu
UzZ-GhToUwY,304560,306960,under vaulting to even make the 850 watt
UzZ-GhToUwY,306960,309520,models work this also means that finally
UzZ-GhToUwY,309520,311919,those that splurged out on a 1 000 watt
UzZ-GhToUwY,311919,314320,plus atx power supply a few years ago
UzZ-GhToUwY,314320,316479,which made no sense at the time that
UzZ-GhToUwY,316479,318479,will actually make sense with these kind
UzZ-GhToUwY,318479,320560,of loads in fact considering the
UzZ-GhToUwY,320560,322960,potential transient spikes in power draw
UzZ-GhToUwY,322960,325120,which gamers nexus did a great video on
UzZ-GhToUwY,325120,327759,recently a decent 1000 watt power supply
UzZ-GhToUwY,327759,331039,for an rtx 4080 or 4090 seems like a
UzZ-GhToUwY,331039,333120,logical pairing at minimum but then
UzZ-GhToUwY,333120,334720,there's the discussion of thermal
UzZ-GhToUwY,334720,337120,performance more power equals more heat
UzZ-GhToUwY,337120,339199,if you've got a full mesh mid tower with
UzZ-GhToUwY,339199,341120,a large volume of air passing through
UzZ-GhToUwY,341120,343199,then you're probably fine but closed
UzZ-GhToUwY,343199,345680,panels limited airflow from cases a few
UzZ-GhToUwY,345680,347840,years ago that's not looking like a very
UzZ-GhToUwY,347840,349520,fun setup now this isn't even
UzZ-GhToUwY,349520,350960,considering that the graphics card
UzZ-GhToUwY,350960,353360,designs themselves will be a good deal
UzZ-GhToUwY,353360,355759,larger current 3090 ti models which are
UzZ-GhToUwY,355759,359039,rated for 450 to 500 watts are three to
UzZ-GhToUwY,359039,361039,four slots in thickness so i mean just
UzZ-GhToUwY,361039,362960,take a look at those that's roughly what
UzZ-GhToUwY,362960,364720,you can expect if you're interested in a
UzZ-GhToUwY,364720,367120,4080 or higher now as most of you know
UzZ-GhToUwY,367120,369120,at this point i am a bit of an itx
UzZ-GhToUwY,369120,371919,fanboy i love my compact pcs and even
UzZ-GhToUwY,371919,373919,for my own system running a 30 90 and a
UzZ-GhToUwY,373919,376800,12 900k very high end components i have
UzZ-GhToUwY,376800,378800,been able to make that setup work and
UzZ-GhToUwY,378800,381360,stick with my compact pcs granted i do
UzZ-GhToUwY,381360,383280,need a pretty overkill liquid cooled
UzZ-GhToUwY,383280,385280,setup to keep that nice and quiet but
UzZ-GhToUwY,385280,387600,you get the picture itx still has been
UzZ-GhToUwY,387600,389520,possible even with the highest
UzZ-GhToUwY,389520,391520,components on the market looking ahead
UzZ-GhToUwY,391520,393520,though i'm not so confident that we can
UzZ-GhToUwY,393520,395360,keep having that approach you know that
UzZ-GhToUwY,395360,397680,no compromise itx approach
UzZ-GhToUwY,397680,400080,i do think with rtx 4000 that if you
UzZ-GhToUwY,400080,401840,want to build something under 20 liters
UzZ-GhToUwY,401840,403199,you will have to compromise to some
UzZ-GhToUwY,403199,405360,degree when it comes to performance now
UzZ-GhToUwY,405360,407440,there are a couple of liquid called itx
UzZ-GhToUwY,407440,408720,builds that i've done which have
UzZ-GhToUwY,408720,411120,comfortably handled upwards of a 350
UzZ-GhToUwY,411120,413520,watt gpu noise levels weren't too bad
UzZ-GhToUwY,413520,416479,cooling was pretty decent but beyond 350
UzZ-GhToUwY,416479,418160,watts you're going to really need to
UzZ-GhToUwY,418160,421280,crank up the fan speed i mean 450 500
UzZ-GhToUwY,421280,423039,watts even after undervolting you're
UzZ-GhToUwY,423039,424880,still looking at a lot of heat load
UzZ-GhToUwY,424880,427039,being dumped into your pc liquid cooled
UzZ-GhToUwY,427039,428560,or not it's going to be really
UzZ-GhToUwY,428560,430080,interesting to see how board partners
UzZ-GhToUwY,430080,432080,adapt their cooler designs and how the
UzZ-GhToUwY,432080,434240,reality plays out it's said that the
UzZ-GhToUwY,434240,438319,ad102 and ad103 gpus so rtx 4090 and
UzZ-GhToUwY,438319,440560,4080 it's expected that those will use
UzZ-GhToUwY,440560,442960,the same pcb layout as what we currently
UzZ-GhToUwY,442960,445199,have so ideally we'll still be working
UzZ-GhToUwY,445199,447360,with those nice compact water blocks
UzZ-GhToUwY,447360,448639,then in terms of what you can expect
UzZ-GhToUwY,448639,450479,when it comes to performance there's
UzZ-GhToUwY,450479,452479,actually not a whole lot to go off the
UzZ-GhToUwY,452479,454479,video memory specs as we saw are almost
UzZ-GhToUwY,454479,456560,identical to current gen there's a
UzZ-GhToUwY,456560,458639,decent bump in cuda cores which should
UzZ-GhToUwY,458639,461199,indicate at least 20 performance gains
UzZ-GhToUwY,461199,463919,for the 4080 and 4070 but even that's
UzZ-GhToUwY,463919,465919,not a whole lot to go off i actually
UzZ-GhToUwY,465919,467680,think the most interesting spec to read
UzZ-GhToUwY,467680,470319,into here is the tdp and basically what
UzZ-GhToUwY,470319,472319,i mean here is that if nvidia are so
UzZ-GhToUwY,472319,474800,confident to take the rtx 4080 and juice
UzZ-GhToUwY,474800,477840,it up 100 watts over the rtx 3080 which
UzZ-GhToUwY,477840,480160,would represent roughly a 30 power
UzZ-GhToUwY,480160,482319,increase then you should expect at least
UzZ-GhToUwY,482319,484479,that when it comes to performance now a
UzZ-GhToUwY,484479,487120,30 increase in performance is actually
UzZ-GhToUwY,487120,488639,quite noticeable at that point the
UzZ-GhToUwY,488639,490479,experience does become noticeably
UzZ-GhToUwY,490479,492960,smoother it's like going from 100 fps to
UzZ-GhToUwY,492960,497360,130 fps or 60 fps to roughly like 80 fps
UzZ-GhToUwY,497360,499280,or so it's also interestingly enough
UzZ-GhToUwY,499280,500800,about the same performance difference
UzZ-GhToUwY,500800,502960,that you'll see between a 2080 ti and a
UzZ-GhToUwY,502960,506479,3080 for roughly a 28 increase in power
UzZ-GhToUwY,506479,508639,so if nvidia are going for a similar
UzZ-GhToUwY,508639,510560,increase in power then a similar
UzZ-GhToUwY,510560,512719,performance jump at minimum over the 30
UzZ-GhToUwY,512719,514959,80 is pretty comfortable to assume in my
UzZ-GhToUwY,514959,516560,opinion now it's not worth spending too
UzZ-GhToUwY,516560,518240,much energy and time getting caught up
UzZ-GhToUwY,518240,520080,about the specs and the details and the
UzZ-GhToUwY,520080,521680,projected performance gains at this
UzZ-GhToUwY,521680,523200,point we're still about three to four
UzZ-GhToUwY,523200,524720,months out from expecting any kind of
UzZ-GhToUwY,524720,526240,announcement from nvidia which they
UzZ-GhToUwY,526240,528080,could delay further if they wanted
UzZ-GhToUwY,528080,529360,similar story when it comes to the
UzZ-GhToUwY,529360,531279,pricing there's absolutely nothing to go
UzZ-GhToUwY,531279,533120,off just yet but i think it's safe to
UzZ-GhToUwY,533120,534399,say that with the current rate of
UzZ-GhToUwY,534399,536480,inflation and the kind of new standard
UzZ-GhToUwY,536480,538399,that's been set for the gpu pricing
UzZ-GhToUwY,538399,539839,there's only one direction that the
UzZ-GhToUwY,539839,542320,msrps are heading and that's up having
UzZ-GhToUwY,542320,544720,said that the gpu market is in a bit of
UzZ-GhToUwY,544720,546720,a healthier position this time around
UzZ-GhToUwY,546720,549120,current gen gpus are closer to msrp than
UzZ-GhToUwY,549120,551440,ever before crypto prices are tanking
UzZ-GhToUwY,551440,553360,pretty hard and a lot of the gamers that
UzZ-GhToUwY,553360,555600,have upgraded to a 30 series gpu in the
UzZ-GhToUwY,555600,557440,past one to two years are pretty
UzZ-GhToUwY,557440,559760,unlikely to upgrade again not only
UzZ-GhToUwY,559760,561360,because they probably had to fork out
UzZ-GhToUwY,561360,563360,quite a bit of cash for that particular
UzZ-GhToUwY,563360,565360,upgrade but also because the performance
UzZ-GhToUwY,565360,567680,of current gen gpus are really really
UzZ-GhToUwY,567680,569279,good and i've spoken to a couple of
UzZ-GhToUwY,569279,571200,people actually people in the discord
UzZ-GhToUwY,571200,573040,people who you know close friends who
UzZ-GhToUwY,573040,576800,have upgraded to 30 70s 30 80s 3090s etc
UzZ-GhToUwY,576800,579279,and they just have zero appetite for any
UzZ-GhToUwY,579279,581519,of these upcoming gpus whether it's rtx
UzZ-GhToUwY,581519,584480,4000 or rd and a3 you know do we really
UzZ-GhToUwY,584480,585920,need to be playing shadow of the tomb
UzZ-GhToUwY,585920,588399,raider at 200 fps do we really need to
UzZ-GhToUwY,588399,590399,be enabling all of these ray tracing
UzZ-GhToUwY,590399,592640,settings to ultra i mean we're kind of
UzZ-GhToUwY,592640,594480,at the point now where if you have a 30
UzZ-GhToUwY,594480,597279,series gpu or an rd and a2 gpu and you
UzZ-GhToUwY,597279,599200,want to see any benefit from upgrading
UzZ-GhToUwY,599200,600800,to what's coming next then you'll
UzZ-GhToUwY,600800,602560,probably need to upgrade also your
UzZ-GhToUwY,602560,604240,monitor because i don't think the
UzZ-GhToUwY,604240,606000,experience is going to be that different
UzZ-GhToUwY,606000,608000,for most people's setups now don't get
UzZ-GhToUwY,608000,609920,me wrong i'm personally very excited to
UzZ-GhToUwY,609920,612880,see what an rtx 4080 or 4090 will look
UzZ-GhToUwY,612880,614800,like in the next few months and the
UzZ-GhToUwY,614800,616399,challenges that will come with that you
UzZ-GhToUwY,616399,618240,know installing it in my own pc for
UzZ-GhToUwY,618240,620320,example but i can't help but feel that
UzZ-GhToUwY,620320,622560,people who might be on 10 series gpus or
UzZ-GhToUwY,622560,625120,20 series cards or amd cards from the
UzZ-GhToUwY,625120,627760,same generation might also be looking to
UzZ-GhToUwY,627760,629760,say the used market and picking up a
UzZ-GhToUwY,629760,632000,nice discounted 30 70 or something
UzZ-GhToUwY,632000,633680,similar so those are my rough thoughts
UzZ-GhToUwY,633680,635440,on where things are headed and you know
UzZ-GhToUwY,635440,636959,what we can expect in the near future
UzZ-GhToUwY,636959,639040,when it comes to gpus i'd love to know
UzZ-GhToUwY,639040,640720,your thoughts as well down below so if
UzZ-GhToUwY,640720,642800,you're keen on these gpus maybe you held
UzZ-GhToUwY,642800,644720,out on the current stuff due to inflated
UzZ-GhToUwY,644720,647040,pricing or poor availability if so let
UzZ-GhToUwY,647040,649680,me know down below as always a huge
UzZ-GhToUwY,649680,651440,thanks for watching and i'll see you all
UzZ-GhToUwY,651440,654880,in the next one
vid,start,end,text
UzZ-GhToUwY,0,1760,so if you take a look at the last few
UzZ-GhToUwY,1760,4480,gpu generations there's more performance
UzZ-GhToUwY,4480,6560,but for a lot more power and a lot more
UzZ-GhToUwY,6560,7919,money and that doesn't look to be
UzZ-GhToUwY,7919,10400,changing for what's coming next today i
UzZ-GhToUwY,10400,12000,want to discuss some of the leaks that
UzZ-GhToUwY,12000,14160,have been popping up for the rtx 4000
UzZ-GhToUwY,14160,15759,series i've been getting a ton of
UzZ-GhToUwY,15759,18080,questions about thermal requirements the
UzZ-GhToUwY,18080,20160,huge power numbers that we're seeing and
UzZ-GhToUwY,20160,22160,just what this means in general for the
UzZ-GhToUwY,22160,24640,kind of pcs that i build and i kind of
UzZ-GhToUwY,24640,26320,lean towards now of course these are
UzZ-GhToUwY,26320,28400,just rumors and leaks you know stuff
UzZ-GhToUwY,28400,30320,that i don't typically report on but
UzZ-GhToUwY,30320,32160,they have been pretty consistent over
UzZ-GhToUwY,32160,34160,the past few months and they all point
UzZ-GhToUwY,34160,36640,in the same direction so i do think we
UzZ-GhToUwY,36640,38800,have a pretty confident sense of what's
UzZ-GhToUwY,38800,40640,going to happen in the next few months
UzZ-GhToUwY,40640,42399,you know maybe not down to the minute
UzZ-GhToUwY,42399,44079,details and specs but at least the
UzZ-GhToUwY,44079,46640,overall direction so let's start there
UzZ-GhToUwY,46640,48879,nvidia's rtx 4000 is rumored to be
UzZ-GhToUwY,48879,51360,running on a custom tsmc 4 nanometer
UzZ-GhToUwY,51360,54640,process appropriately named tsmc4n and
UzZ-GhToUwY,54640,56320,nextgen at this point we'll go under the
UzZ-GhToUwY,56320,58960,name ada lovelace now the number four in
UzZ-GhToUwY,58960,60640,four nanometer doesn't really tell us
UzZ-GhToUwY,60640,62719,much these days it doesn't refer to any
UzZ-GhToUwY,62719,64960,physical node pitch or measurement like
UzZ-GhToUwY,64960,66960,it used to but for what it's worth we
UzZ-GhToUwY,66960,69439,can definitely expect denser silicon and
UzZ-GhToUwY,69439,71600,naturally more transistors than ever in
UzZ-GhToUwY,71600,74000,a gaming gpu and as usual some of you
UzZ-GhToUwY,74000,75360,are probably tired of hearing me say
UzZ-GhToUwY,75360,76960,this but it's going to be the high-end
UzZ-GhToUwY,76960,80400,stuff coming out first so rtx 4090 4080
UzZ-GhToUwY,80400,82960,4070 is what is expected to be the first
UzZ-GhToUwY,82960,84640,three cards coming out to kind of kick
UzZ-GhToUwY,84640,87200,things off just as we had the 30 90 30
UzZ-GhToUwY,87200,90560,80 30 70 for the 30 series so if you're
UzZ-GhToUwY,90560,93600,looking forward to a 40 60 40 50
UzZ-GhToUwY,93600,95600,definitely don't expect those until next
UzZ-GhToUwY,95600,98159,year at least now surprisingly the rtx
UzZ-GhToUwY,98159,100720,4080 is expected to use a completely
UzZ-GhToUwY,100720,103280,different gpu to the 4090 this time
UzZ-GhToUwY,103280,105680,around not as with the 3080 which is
UzZ-GhToUwY,105680,108399,essentially a cut down 1390 both using
UzZ-GhToUwY,108399,111439,the ga102 gpu that's reflected in the
UzZ-GhToUwY,111439,113200,number of cuda cores separating them as
UzZ-GhToUwY,113200,114960,well as we've seen performance wise the
UzZ-GhToUwY,114960,117600,30 19 30 80 aren't that different but
UzZ-GhToUwY,117600,119280,this time around there's expected to be
UzZ-GhToUwY,119280,121360,a massive difference in compute power
UzZ-GhToUwY,121360,123920,between the 40 90 and 40 80. these leaks
UzZ-GhToUwY,123920,126640,from videocards.com suggest a colossal
UzZ-GhToUwY,126640,128800,60 increase in the number of streaming
UzZ-GhToUwY,128800,130800,multiprocessors and cuda cores over the
UzZ-GhToUwY,130800,134000,4080 not only that but a huge memory
UzZ-GhToUwY,134000,136720,uplift as well the 4090 is expected to
UzZ-GhToUwY,136720,138640,use the same memory configuration as
UzZ-GhToUwY,138640,141680,this generation's rtx 3090 ti whereas
UzZ-GhToUwY,141680,144080,the 4080 is expected to get a relative
UzZ-GhToUwY,144080,145760,downgrade now that would be very
UzZ-GhToUwY,145760,148239,surprising if true extremely unusual to
UzZ-GhToUwY,148239,150560,see a downgrade in video memory between
UzZ-GhToUwY,150560,153680,gpu generations but if 4080 performance
UzZ-GhToUwY,153680,155360,is higher than expected it does leave
UzZ-GhToUwY,155360,157200,room in the tank for nvidia to release
UzZ-GhToUwY,157200,160239,say a 4080 ti or a 4080 super with
UzZ-GhToUwY,160239,161920,primarily a juiced up memory
UzZ-GhToUwY,161920,164879,configuration as for the suggested 4070
UzZ-GhToUwY,164879,166400,it's about what you would expect
UzZ-GhToUwY,166400,168480,generous cuda core bump over the current
UzZ-GhToUwY,168480,171280,3070 with the gddr6 memory config
UzZ-GhToUwY,171280,173120,overall not looking too different
UzZ-GhToUwY,173120,174560,overall though it's looking pretty
UzZ-GhToUwY,174560,176080,interesting to kick things off if this
UzZ-GhToUwY,176080,177840,is how things are going to play out
UzZ-GhToUwY,177840,179599,there will be considerable performance
UzZ-GhToUwY,179599,181760,uplifts over current gen especially if
UzZ-GhToUwY,181760,184400,that rumored 4090 spec is accurate
UzZ-GhToUwY,184400,186400,although the quoted tdp and power
UzZ-GhToUwY,186400,188720,consumption numbers are a bit odd i mean
UzZ-GhToUwY,188720,190800,take a look at the 4090 for example for
UzZ-GhToUwY,190800,192800,such a huge increase in the amount of
UzZ-GhToUwY,192800,195519,silicon over the 4080 the 4090 will
UzZ-GhToUwY,195519,197920,definitely pull a bunch more power that
UzZ-GhToUwY,197920,199920,is unless the 4080 is running
UzZ-GhToUwY,199920,201840,considerably higher clock speeds which
UzZ-GhToUwY,201840,203920,are much less efficient but yeah i would
UzZ-GhToUwY,203920,206159,expect a lot more than 30 watts between
UzZ-GhToUwY,206159,208319,them but just how realistic though are
UzZ-GhToUwY,208319,210319,those expected power numbers i mean you
UzZ-GhToUwY,210319,211840,take a look at the 40 4090 and what
UzZ-GhToUwY,211840,214159,that's expected to pull that's plus 100
UzZ-GhToUwY,214159,216480,watts over the current 3090 and then you
UzZ-GhToUwY,216480,218879,know plus 100 watts again for the 4080
UzZ-GhToUwY,218879,221920,even the 4070 is plus 50 watts over the
UzZ-GhToUwY,221920,224720,current 3070. to be honest it's not too
UzZ-GhToUwY,224720,226720,unrealistic i mean you take a look at
UzZ-GhToUwY,226720,228560,what nvidia have invested to something
UzZ-GhToUwY,228560,231200,like this okay completely different you
UzZ-GhToUwY,231200,232640,know thermal design to what we were
UzZ-GhToUwY,232640,234959,using before much more you know dense
UzZ-GhToUwY,234959,237200,space efficient and power capable power
UzZ-GhToUwY,237200,238959,connectors putting two and two together
UzZ-GhToUwY,238959,240400,looking at what nvidia is currently
UzZ-GhToUwY,240400,242000,doing and also the pretty consistent
UzZ-GhToUwY,242000,244080,leaks i'd say that those expected power
UzZ-GhToUwY,244080,245840,numbers are pretty accurate and to be
UzZ-GhToUwY,245840,248239,honest if we see plus 500 watts plus
UzZ-GhToUwY,248239,250480,even maybe 600 watt gpus coming out in
UzZ-GhToUwY,250480,252400,the near future i would not be too
UzZ-GhToUwY,252400,254720,surprised i mean we already have evgas
UzZ-GhToUwY,254720,257600,for the win 3 30 80s for example which
UzZ-GhToUwY,257600,260400,has a v bias that can go up to 450 watts
UzZ-GhToUwY,260400,262000,and it can actually hit that their
UzZ-GhToUwY,262000,265919,390tis have v bios as well up to 550
UzZ-GhToUwY,265919,268400,watts again that's current gen that's
UzZ-GhToUwY,268400,271680,3090ti 3090 as well around the 500 watt
UzZ-GhToUwY,271680,272800,mark for some of these factory
UzZ-GhToUwY,272800,275360,overclocked aftermarket cards so looking
UzZ-GhToUwY,275360,276800,at these power numbers it's not too
UzZ-GhToUwY,276800,278479,unrealistic that we're going to kind of
UzZ-GhToUwY,278479,281040,see 4080s and 4090s probably hitting
UzZ-GhToUwY,281040,283600,that mark again upwards of 600 watts is
UzZ-GhToUwY,283600,285600,probably not unrealistic now with that
UzZ-GhToUwY,285600,287440,kind of power draw probably forget an
UzZ-GhToUwY,287440,289520,sfx power supply at least the ones that
UzZ-GhToUwY,289520,291199,are out there on the market today
UzZ-GhToUwY,291199,292960,popular enthusiast models like the
UzZ-GhToUwY,292960,295199,corsair sf750 platinum which have
UzZ-GhToUwY,295199,298080,survived like an rtx 3090 no problem
UzZ-GhToUwY,298080,300000,they will finally meet their maker if
UzZ-GhToUwY,300000,302320,we're talking about 600 watt gpus and
UzZ-GhToUwY,302320,304560,you'll likely need some serious gpu
UzZ-GhToUwY,304560,306960,under vaulting to even make the 850 watt
UzZ-GhToUwY,306960,309520,models work this also means that finally
UzZ-GhToUwY,309520,311919,those that splurged out on a 1 000 watt
UzZ-GhToUwY,311919,314320,plus atx power supply a few years ago
UzZ-GhToUwY,314320,316479,which made no sense at the time that
UzZ-GhToUwY,316479,318479,will actually make sense with these kind
UzZ-GhToUwY,318479,320560,of loads in fact considering the
UzZ-GhToUwY,320560,322960,potential transient spikes in power draw
UzZ-GhToUwY,322960,325120,which gamers nexus did a great video on
UzZ-GhToUwY,325120,327759,recently a decent 1000 watt power supply
UzZ-GhToUwY,327759,331039,for an rtx 4080 or 4090 seems like a
UzZ-GhToUwY,331039,333120,logical pairing at minimum but then
UzZ-GhToUwY,333120,334720,there's the discussion of thermal
UzZ-GhToUwY,334720,337120,performance more power equals more heat
UzZ-GhToUwY,337120,339199,if you've got a full mesh mid tower with
UzZ-GhToUwY,339199,341120,a large volume of air passing through
UzZ-GhToUwY,341120,343199,then you're probably fine but closed
UzZ-GhToUwY,343199,345680,panels limited airflow from cases a few
UzZ-GhToUwY,345680,347840,years ago that's not looking like a very
UzZ-GhToUwY,347840,349520,fun setup now this isn't even
UzZ-GhToUwY,349520,350960,considering that the graphics card
UzZ-GhToUwY,350960,353360,designs themselves will be a good deal
UzZ-GhToUwY,353360,355759,larger current 3090 ti models which are
UzZ-GhToUwY,355759,359039,rated for 450 to 500 watts are three to
UzZ-GhToUwY,359039,361039,four slots in thickness so i mean just
UzZ-GhToUwY,361039,362960,take a look at those that's roughly what
UzZ-GhToUwY,362960,364720,you can expect if you're interested in a
UzZ-GhToUwY,364720,367120,4080 or higher now as most of you know
UzZ-GhToUwY,367120,369120,at this point i am a bit of an itx
UzZ-GhToUwY,369120,371919,fanboy i love my compact pcs and even
UzZ-GhToUwY,371919,373919,for my own system running a 30 90 and a
UzZ-GhToUwY,373919,376800,12 900k very high end components i have
UzZ-GhToUwY,376800,378800,been able to make that setup work and
UzZ-GhToUwY,378800,381360,stick with my compact pcs granted i do
UzZ-GhToUwY,381360,383280,need a pretty overkill liquid cooled
UzZ-GhToUwY,383280,385280,setup to keep that nice and quiet but
UzZ-GhToUwY,385280,387600,you get the picture itx still has been
UzZ-GhToUwY,387600,389520,possible even with the highest
UzZ-GhToUwY,389520,391520,components on the market looking ahead
UzZ-GhToUwY,391520,393520,though i'm not so confident that we can
UzZ-GhToUwY,393520,395360,keep having that approach you know that
UzZ-GhToUwY,395360,397680,no compromise itx approach
UzZ-GhToUwY,397680,400080,i do think with rtx 4000 that if you
UzZ-GhToUwY,400080,401840,want to build something under 20 liters
UzZ-GhToUwY,401840,403199,you will have to compromise to some
UzZ-GhToUwY,403199,405360,degree when it comes to performance now
UzZ-GhToUwY,405360,407440,there are a couple of liquid called itx
UzZ-GhToUwY,407440,408720,builds that i've done which have
UzZ-GhToUwY,408720,411120,comfortably handled upwards of a 350
UzZ-GhToUwY,411120,413520,watt gpu noise levels weren't too bad
UzZ-GhToUwY,413520,416479,cooling was pretty decent but beyond 350
UzZ-GhToUwY,416479,418160,watts you're going to really need to
UzZ-GhToUwY,418160,421280,crank up the fan speed i mean 450 500
UzZ-GhToUwY,421280,423039,watts even after undervolting you're
UzZ-GhToUwY,423039,424880,still looking at a lot of heat load
UzZ-GhToUwY,424880,427039,being dumped into your pc liquid cooled
UzZ-GhToUwY,427039,428560,or not it's going to be really
UzZ-GhToUwY,428560,430080,interesting to see how board partners
UzZ-GhToUwY,430080,432080,adapt their cooler designs and how the
UzZ-GhToUwY,432080,434240,reality plays out it's said that the
UzZ-GhToUwY,434240,438319,ad102 and ad103 gpus so rtx 4090 and
UzZ-GhToUwY,438319,440560,4080 it's expected that those will use
UzZ-GhToUwY,440560,442960,the same pcb layout as what we currently
UzZ-GhToUwY,442960,445199,have so ideally we'll still be working
UzZ-GhToUwY,445199,447360,with those nice compact water blocks
UzZ-GhToUwY,447360,448639,then in terms of what you can expect
UzZ-GhToUwY,448639,450479,when it comes to performance there's
UzZ-GhToUwY,450479,452479,actually not a whole lot to go off the
UzZ-GhToUwY,452479,454479,video memory specs as we saw are almost
UzZ-GhToUwY,454479,456560,identical to current gen there's a
UzZ-GhToUwY,456560,458639,decent bump in cuda cores which should
UzZ-GhToUwY,458639,461199,indicate at least 20 performance gains
UzZ-GhToUwY,461199,463919,for the 4080 and 4070 but even that's
UzZ-GhToUwY,463919,465919,not a whole lot to go off i actually
UzZ-GhToUwY,465919,467680,think the most interesting spec to read
UzZ-GhToUwY,467680,470319,into here is the tdp and basically what
UzZ-GhToUwY,470319,472319,i mean here is that if nvidia are so
UzZ-GhToUwY,472319,474800,confident to take the rtx 4080 and juice
UzZ-GhToUwY,474800,477840,it up 100 watts over the rtx 3080 which
UzZ-GhToUwY,477840,480160,would represent roughly a 30 power
UzZ-GhToUwY,480160,482319,increase then you should expect at least
UzZ-GhToUwY,482319,484479,that when it comes to performance now a
UzZ-GhToUwY,484479,487120,30 increase in performance is actually
UzZ-GhToUwY,487120,488639,quite noticeable at that point the
UzZ-GhToUwY,488639,490479,experience does become noticeably
UzZ-GhToUwY,490479,492960,smoother it's like going from 100 fps to
UzZ-GhToUwY,492960,497360,130 fps or 60 fps to roughly like 80 fps
UzZ-GhToUwY,497360,499280,or so it's also interestingly enough
UzZ-GhToUwY,499280,500800,about the same performance difference
UzZ-GhToUwY,500800,502960,that you'll see between a 2080 ti and a
UzZ-GhToUwY,502960,506479,3080 for roughly a 28 increase in power
UzZ-GhToUwY,506479,508639,so if nvidia are going for a similar
UzZ-GhToUwY,508639,510560,increase in power then a similar
UzZ-GhToUwY,510560,512719,performance jump at minimum over the 30
UzZ-GhToUwY,512719,514959,80 is pretty comfortable to assume in my
UzZ-GhToUwY,514959,516560,opinion now it's not worth spending too
UzZ-GhToUwY,516560,518240,much energy and time getting caught up
UzZ-GhToUwY,518240,520080,about the specs and the details and the
UzZ-GhToUwY,520080,521680,projected performance gains at this
UzZ-GhToUwY,521680,523200,point we're still about three to four
UzZ-GhToUwY,523200,524720,months out from expecting any kind of
UzZ-GhToUwY,524720,526240,announcement from nvidia which they
UzZ-GhToUwY,526240,528080,could delay further if they wanted
UzZ-GhToUwY,528080,529360,similar story when it comes to the
UzZ-GhToUwY,529360,531279,pricing there's absolutely nothing to go
UzZ-GhToUwY,531279,533120,off just yet but i think it's safe to
UzZ-GhToUwY,533120,534399,say that with the current rate of
UzZ-GhToUwY,534399,536480,inflation and the kind of new standard
UzZ-GhToUwY,536480,538399,that's been set for the gpu pricing
UzZ-GhToUwY,538399,539839,there's only one direction that the
UzZ-GhToUwY,539839,542320,msrps are heading and that's up having
UzZ-GhToUwY,542320,544720,said that the gpu market is in a bit of
UzZ-GhToUwY,544720,546720,a healthier position this time around
UzZ-GhToUwY,546720,549120,current gen gpus are closer to msrp than
UzZ-GhToUwY,549120,551440,ever before crypto prices are tanking
UzZ-GhToUwY,551440,553360,pretty hard and a lot of the gamers that
UzZ-GhToUwY,553360,555600,have upgraded to a 30 series gpu in the
UzZ-GhToUwY,555600,557440,past one to two years are pretty
UzZ-GhToUwY,557440,559760,unlikely to upgrade again not only
UzZ-GhToUwY,559760,561360,because they probably had to fork out
UzZ-GhToUwY,561360,563360,quite a bit of cash for that particular
UzZ-GhToUwY,563360,565360,upgrade but also because the performance
UzZ-GhToUwY,565360,567680,of current gen gpus are really really
UzZ-GhToUwY,567680,569279,good and i've spoken to a couple of
UzZ-GhToUwY,569279,571200,people actually people in the discord
UzZ-GhToUwY,571200,573040,people who you know close friends who
UzZ-GhToUwY,573040,576800,have upgraded to 30 70s 30 80s 3090s etc
UzZ-GhToUwY,576800,579279,and they just have zero appetite for any
UzZ-GhToUwY,579279,581519,of these upcoming gpus whether it's rtx
UzZ-GhToUwY,581519,584480,4000 or rd and a3 you know do we really
UzZ-GhToUwY,584480,585920,need to be playing shadow of the tomb
UzZ-GhToUwY,585920,588399,raider at 200 fps do we really need to
UzZ-GhToUwY,588399,590399,be enabling all of these ray tracing
UzZ-GhToUwY,590399,592640,settings to ultra i mean we're kind of
UzZ-GhToUwY,592640,594480,at the point now where if you have a 30
UzZ-GhToUwY,594480,597279,series gpu or an rd and a2 gpu and you
UzZ-GhToUwY,597279,599200,want to see any benefit from upgrading
UzZ-GhToUwY,599200,600800,to what's coming next then you'll
UzZ-GhToUwY,600800,602560,probably need to upgrade also your
UzZ-GhToUwY,602560,604240,monitor because i don't think the
UzZ-GhToUwY,604240,606000,experience is going to be that different
UzZ-GhToUwY,606000,608000,for most people's setups now don't get
UzZ-GhToUwY,608000,609920,me wrong i'm personally very excited to
UzZ-GhToUwY,609920,612880,see what an rtx 4080 or 4090 will look
UzZ-GhToUwY,612880,614800,like in the next few months and the
UzZ-GhToUwY,614800,616399,challenges that will come with that you
UzZ-GhToUwY,616399,618240,know installing it in my own pc for
UzZ-GhToUwY,618240,620320,example but i can't help but feel that
UzZ-GhToUwY,620320,622560,people who might be on 10 series gpus or
UzZ-GhToUwY,622560,625120,20 series cards or amd cards from the
UzZ-GhToUwY,625120,627760,same generation might also be looking to
UzZ-GhToUwY,627760,629760,say the used market and picking up a
UzZ-GhToUwY,629760,632000,nice discounted 30 70 or something
UzZ-GhToUwY,632000,633680,similar so those are my rough thoughts
UzZ-GhToUwY,633680,635440,on where things are headed and you know
UzZ-GhToUwY,635440,636959,what we can expect in the near future
UzZ-GhToUwY,636959,639040,when it comes to gpus i'd love to know
UzZ-GhToUwY,639040,640720,your thoughts as well down below so if
UzZ-GhToUwY,640720,642800,you're keen on these gpus maybe you held
UzZ-GhToUwY,642800,644720,out on the current stuff due to inflated
UzZ-GhToUwY,644720,647040,pricing or poor availability if so let
UzZ-GhToUwY,647040,649680,me know down below as always a huge
UzZ-GhToUwY,649680,651440,thanks for watching and i'll see you all
UzZ-GhToUwY,651440,654880,in the next one
