XEqNLHCa8l4,320,1520,like anything in life when you're
XEqNLHCa8l4,1520,4080,standing on the edge of that precipice
XEqNLHCa8l4,4080,5600,and you have to make that choice it
XEqNLHCa8l4,5600,7440,defines who you are and certainly for
XEqNLHCa8l4,7440,9200,these for all of these characters they
XEqNLHCa8l4,9200,12639,all get faced with that choice
XEqNLHCa8l4,14559,16160,what i love about the show is i open up
XEqNLHCa8l4,16160,18880,every script and at least once i say to
XEqNLHCa8l4,18880,20880,myself i've never
XEqNLHCa8l4,20880,23119,seen that before in my life
XEqNLHCa8l4,23119,24480,i think one of the main themes that i
XEqNLHCa8l4,24480,27279,get out of season three is um be careful
XEqNLHCa8l4,27279,29679,what you wish for you just might get it
XEqNLHCa8l4,29679,31439,he put some stuff in that script and
XEqNLHCa8l4,31439,33360,he's he's written this character in a
XEqNLHCa8l4,33360,35120,way that uh i had to call him and be
XEqNLHCa8l4,35120,36160,like
XEqNLHCa8l4,36160,37920,wait what do you want me to do how does
XEqNLHCa8l4,37920,38960,this
XEqNLHCa8l4,38960,40719,has this play in the
XEqNLHCa8l4,40719,42320,i can't do that man
XEqNLHCa8l4,42320,43440,when
XEqNLHCa8l4,43440,46239,you have jensen ackles on board
XEqNLHCa8l4,46239,49200,and you push him to a zone where he is
XEqNLHCa8l4,49200,51440,so uncomfortable that he's making phone
XEqNLHCa8l4,51440,53820,calls that you're in the right space
XEqNLHCa8l4,53820,55600,[Laughter]
XEqNLHCa8l4,55600,58399,i did it anyway but you know that's what
XEqNLHCa8l4,58399,62120,being on the boys is for
XEqNLHCa8l4,75840,77840,i knew it was gonna be exciting i knew
XEqNLHCa8l4,77840,80080,uh that this was gonna be something that
XEqNLHCa8l4,80080,82560,uh this was gonna be he you know he was
XEqNLHCa8l4,82560,85119,gonna kind of uncage me as well
XEqNLHCa8l4,85119,87439,and he stretched it pretty i mean he we
XEqNLHCa8l4,87439,89280,we broke some uh
XEqNLHCa8l4,89280,91200,some barriers i think on supernatural
XEqNLHCa8l4,91200,93200,early on certainly with with some of the
XEqNLHCa8l4,93200,94560,gore that we had some of the horror
XEqNLHCa8l4,94560,96799,aspects uh that television hadn't
XEqNLHCa8l4,96799,98799,necessarily seen before so i think he's
XEqNLHCa8l4,98799,100560,always looking to push the envelope
XEqNLHCa8l4,100560,103280,um that's definitely his mo and now we
XEqNLHCa8l4,103280,104640,get actual proof of that there's
XEqNLHCa8l4,104640,105840,something that happens in the first
XEqNLHCa8l4,105840,108320,episode that i can't say but i think
XEqNLHCa8l4,108320,110320,like sets this once you see it you'll
XEqNLHCa8l4,110320,113360,know this kind of sets the stage for
XEqNLHCa8l4,113360,115280,what's to come we find butcher in a very
XEqNLHCa8l4,115280,118640,uh frustrated place you know he's really
XEqNLHCa8l4,118640,121439,trying to juggle
XEqNLHCa8l4,121439,123360,his responsibility to the promise that
XEqNLHCa8l4,123360,126479,he made with becker to look after ryan
XEqNLHCa8l4,126479,128959,and he has a pretty clear objective to
XEqNLHCa8l4,128959,130720,get homeland so
XEqNLHCa8l4,130720,132480,there's kind of a bit of an internal war
XEqNLHCa8l4,132480,133840,going on there and
XEqNLHCa8l4,133840,135440,to which way he's going to go
XEqNLHCa8l4,135440,136800,you know every time we get a script i'm
XEqNLHCa8l4,136800,138720,like i have no idea what's coming and
XEqNLHCa8l4,138720,140160,every time i think
XEqNLHCa8l4,140160,143360,they've gone too far hashtag spearing a
XEqNLHCa8l4,143360,146480,whale with a with a speedboat um it
XEqNLHCa8l4,146480,149360,becomes you know something of a like
XEqNLHCa8l4,149360,151599,like an iconic scene for the show or
XEqNLHCa8l4,151599,153040,something incredibly memorable and they
XEqNLHCa8l4,153040,154400,pull it off so
XEqNLHCa8l4,154400,156000,so what do i you know i'm just an actor
XEqNLHCa8l4,156000,158480,what do we know
XEqNLHCa8l4,158830,162009,[Music]
XEqNLHCa8l4,169040,170720,i mean the big difference with between
XEqNLHCa8l4,170720,172560,soulja boy and some of these other soups
XEqNLHCa8l4,172560,175519,on the show is um this guy is not a he's
XEqNLHCa8l4,175519,178640,not a polished uh performer
XEqNLHCa8l4,178640,179760,in the sense that i think a lot of the
XEqNLHCa8l4,179760,181280,soups are nowadays
XEqNLHCa8l4,181280,182959,uh he's old school he's he's the
XEqNLHCa8l4,182959,184720,original superhero
XEqNLHCa8l4,184720,186480,you know he's he's from
XEqNLHCa8l4,186480,188800,an era that is that is
XEqNLHCa8l4,188800,190480,being close to forgotten
XEqNLHCa8l4,190480,194000,uh a time a time passed you know he
XEqNLHCa8l4,194000,196480,he was world war ii he you know partied
XEqNLHCa8l4,196480,198959,with hefner the the playboy mansion like
XEqNLHCa8l4,198959,201440,this is just a different type of
XEqNLHCa8l4,201440,203280,uh of character
XEqNLHCa8l4,203280,204159,and
XEqNLHCa8l4,204159,206560,he he certainly represents i think a lot
XEqNLHCa8l4,206560,208720,of that toxic masculinity that is that
XEqNLHCa8l4,208720,211200,is so deeply rooted in
XEqNLHCa8l4,211200,213599,in a lot of of what our society feels
XEqNLHCa8l4,213599,214560,and so
XEqNLHCa8l4,214560,219400,eric's had a lot of fun with with that
XEqNLHCa8l4,220550,223839,[Music]
XEqNLHCa8l4,229540,230879,[Music]
XEqNLHCa8l4,230879,232400,you hope it doesn't really involve you
XEqNLHCa8l4,232400,234400,and you kind of do hope it involves you
XEqNLHCa8l4,234400,235840,um but you open up the script and you're
XEqNLHCa8l4,235840,238000,like what
XEqNLHCa8l4,238000,239760,does eric kripke have for me today this
XEqNLHCa8l4,239760,241120,is gonna be so exciting i don't even
XEqNLHCa8l4,241120,243040,know if i can scoop i swear but you can
XEqNLHCa8l4,243040,245439,bleep it
XEqNLHCa8l4,245840,246799,okay
XEqNLHCa8l4,246799,250080,the ethical and moral debate that is
XEqNLHCa8l4,250080,252480,prompted for all of the characters this
XEqNLHCa8l4,252480,255280,season is how far are you willing to go
XEqNLHCa8l4,255280,257359,where is the line at what point do you
XEqNLHCa8l4,257359,259199,become the thing that you are trying to
XEqNLHCa8l4,259199,260799,destroy
XEqNLHCa8l4,260799,262800,um and of course you know
XEqNLHCa8l4,262800,264479,in making that choice
XEqNLHCa8l4,264479,266639,you're either on this side or that side
XEqNLHCa8l4,266639,268880,it's impossible to wrap your head
XEqNLHCa8l4,268880,271680,around uh
XEqNLHCa8l4,271680,272960,around
XEqNLHCa8l4,272960,274639,the current social and political
XEqNLHCa8l4,274639,277360,situation in america it's just bananas
XEqNLHCa8l4,277360,279600,so it's not it you know we we cherry
XEqNLHCa8l4,279600,280880,pick
XEqNLHCa8l4,280880,283600,the the elements that we want to involve
XEqNLHCa8l4,283600,284479,uh
XEqNLHCa8l4,284479,286479,the character and and they're sure
XEqNLHCa8l4,286479,287759,really i mean it's
XEqNLHCa8l4,287759,289120,you just can't cover you simply can't
XEqNLHCa8l4,289120,290639,cover everything and one character can't
XEqNLHCa8l4,290639,292400,represent everything so
XEqNLHCa8l4,292400,293759,as i say that i'm thinking about things
XEqNLHCa8l4,293759,295280,that are in season three and i can't
XEqNLHCa8l4,295280,296560,wait for you to see
XEqNLHCa8l4,296560,298240,but the fun thing about this season is
XEqNLHCa8l4,298240,299680,that it really pushes all the characters
XEqNLHCa8l4,299680,301120,to the limit like you have to make a
XEqNLHCa8l4,301120,304000,choice which side are you on you know
XEqNLHCa8l4,304000,305759,and as far as butcher butcher is
XEqNLHCa8l4,305759,307759,concerned this season everybody else
XEqNLHCa8l4,307759,309199,thinks they're in a knife fight and he
XEqNLHCa8l4,309199,310720,knows they're in a gunfight and he's
XEqNLHCa8l4,310720,312560,like come on wake up
XEqNLHCa8l4,312560,313840,so there was a lot there's certainly a
XEqNLHCa8l4,313840,316160,lot to pull from
XEqNLHCa8l4,316160,316880,and
XEqNLHCa8l4,316880,318400,it was interesting
XEqNLHCa8l4,318400,321759,kind of mingling that history
XEqNLHCa8l4,321759,323680,with this
XEqNLHCa8l4,323680,324560,new
XEqNLHCa8l4,324560,326880,idea of what a superhero is
XEqNLHCa8l4,326880,329039,um you know i was saying i'm saying to
XEqNLHCa8l4,329039,330880,somebody it's it was interesting being
XEqNLHCa8l4,330880,333440,the new kid on the block but playing
XEqNLHCa8l4,333440,337320,the guy who's been there the longest
XEqNLHCa8l4,342720,344800,you know having me nominations and and
XEqNLHCa8l4,344800,346800,that sort of acclaim it's crazy the
XEqNLHCa8l4,346800,349039,thing that i liked about it the most was
XEqNLHCa8l4,349039,351280,that the clip they showed
XEqNLHCa8l4,351280,353360,for the emmy nomination was literally us
XEqNLHCa8l4,353360,356479,driving a speedboat into a whale
XEqNLHCa8l4,356479,358160,i love that she's like now the final
XEqNLHCa8l4,358160,360479,nominations for best drama series the
XEqNLHCa8l4,360479,362880,boys and it immediately cuts to me
XEqNLHCa8l4,362880,365440,screaming uh going into a whale and then
XEqNLHCa8l4,365440,368639,after that he goes the crown and i
XEqNLHCa8l4,368639,369919,died i was like this is the most
XEqNLHCa8l4,369919,372960,appropriate clip um to show for our show
XEqNLHCa8l4,372960,375680,getting nominated for best drama there's
XEqNLHCa8l4,375680,377520,all these serious categories going on
XEqNLHCa8l4,377520,380080,and then it's like
XEqNLHCa8l4,380080,382560,was a bit of an outsider so um it was
XEqNLHCa8l4,382560,383759,nice to be
XEqNLHCa8l4,383759,384960,included in
XEqNLHCa8l4,384960,386800,such a prestigious event
XEqNLHCa8l4,386800,388400,we're doing something really messed up
XEqNLHCa8l4,388400,391919,and and something that makes us very um
XEqNLHCa8l4,391919,395199,very happy in how delightfully uh picked
XEqNLHCa8l4,395199,397759,up it is but to have to be recognized in
XEqNLHCa8l4,397759,399919,that way was so cool my relationship to
XEqNLHCa8l4,399919,402160,the show doesn't change because of what
XEqNLHCa8l4,402160,404000,amy voters
XEqNLHCa8l4,404000,405840,might think i think the material is the
XEqNLHCa8l4,405840,407759,material and it has been since day one
XEqNLHCa8l4,407759,408800,and you know it's one of the things that
XEqNLHCa8l4,408800,410240,i'm proud of about the show is that it
XEqNLHCa8l4,410240,413520,doesn't pull punches and uh and it's not
XEqNLHCa8l4,413520,415520,shy about what the
XEqNLHCa8l4,415520,417440,subject matter that it wants to tackle
XEqNLHCa8l4,417440,419199,to a certain extent is really kind of
XEqNLHCa8l4,419199,421280,beyond our immediate area of concern
XEqNLHCa8l4,421280,422800,we're just focused on making the best
XEqNLHCa8l4,422800,425440,show we can and push the limits and
XEqNLHCa8l4,425440,427599,continuing to deliver something to the
XEqNLHCa8l4,427599,429840,audience that they haven't seen before
XEqNLHCa8l4,429840,430960,but that's the exciting thing about
XEqNLHCa8l4,430960,432880,working with kripke is he pushes your
XEqNLHCa8l4,432880,434240,comfort levels
XEqNLHCa8l4,434240,437440,and and i i enjoy that as as a as a
XEqNLHCa8l4,437440,439039,performer and i also enjoy that as an
XEqNLHCa8l4,439039,440319,audience member
XEqNLHCa8l4,440319,443440,um he takes risks and he expects his his
XEqNLHCa8l4,443440,445680,characters and and his actors to go
XEqNLHCa8l4,445680,448560,along with him somehow that man's
XEqNLHCa8l4,448560,451280,mind manages to create new levels of
XEqNLHCa8l4,451280,453759,homicidal maniac the boy season 3 is the
XEqNLHCa8l4,453759,455199,most insane
XEqNLHCa8l4,455199,457759,season of tv i think ever filmed i'm
XEqNLHCa8l4,457759,459520,trying not to be hyperbolic but it is
XEqNLHCa8l4,459520,460639,really
XEqNLHCa8l4,460639,462240,really truly insane if you'd like to
XEqNLHCa8l4,462240,464160,play it safe then he's definitely not a
XEqNLHCa8l4,464160,465919,showrunner you want to be you want to be
XEqNLHCa8l4,465919,469319,in business with
XEqNLHCa8l4,480990,485039,[Music]
XEqNLHCa8l4,485039,487120,you
