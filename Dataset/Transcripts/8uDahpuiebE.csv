8uDahpuiebE,922959,928560,very important to listen to the flagger  yeah because the go-kart engines are so
8uDahpuiebE,928560,935680,loud they probably can't yell at you and  through the helmet you can't hear them  so you can communicate with colored
8uDahpuiebE,935680,941440,flags let's learn about them  whoa what color is this flag
8uDahpuiebE,941440,948320,yeah that flag is the color green and  this means it's the start of the race as
8uDahpuiebE,948320,955199,soon as that green flag drops it's go  time  oh look at this flag

8uDahpuiebE,961440,967040,see the flagger  that means to slow down yeah do not pass

8uDahpuiebE,1010560,1017120,and when you see the flagger moving it  up that means move over let others pass
8uDahpuiebE,1017120,1024079,yeah maybe i'll be going really slow  and that means if i see the blue one i'm
8uDahpuiebE,1024079,1029918,gonna move over to let others pass yeah  it's really important to be safe on the  track

8uDahpuiebE,1065120,1071760,and the last flag yep the black and  white checkered flag that means the race

8uDahpuiebE,2370079,2377119,off all right first we need this  wrap around one piece of white paper
8uDahpuiebE,2377119,2384720,yeah here we go  yeah  and then we take a piece of tape
8uDahpuiebE,2384720,2391839,tape is really nice  to tape two pieces  of paper together
8uDahpuiebE,2391839,2399280,just like this  you can also use glue but glue sometimes  gets a little messy so this time we're
8uDahpuiebE,2399280,2404960,just gonna use tape  alright now  we have the body of the rocket
8uDahpuiebE,2404960,2412000,okay now we need to make  fins  just like this
8uDahpuiebE,2412000,2417839,let's see here  how do we do this
8uDahpuiebE,2418000,2424880,i don't know  all right  let's cut them it used to be a big
8uDahpuiebE,2424880,2430240,rectangle and now  i'm going to go like this
8uDahpuiebE,2434880,2442240,and we made  a  triangle okay now let's fold it like  that okay there's one
8uDahpuiebE,2442240,2450720,now  now we have another triangle yeah
8uDahpuiebE,2450720,2456720,okay fold that  now we can tape these fins on the body
8uDahpuiebE,2456720,2464839,of the rocket  that tape is really tough
8uDahpuiebE,2464839,2471520,hey  okay  there's  one fin how does that look
8uDahpuiebE,2471520,2477960,really good  then we'll do a fin on the  other side
8uDahpuiebE,2480640,2486720,there we go  yeah how does that look that looks  really good
8uDahpuiebE,2486720,2494640,now we need to do the nose cone we can  use the same piece of paper  all right so it looks like we do a
8uDahpuiebE,2494640,2500240,little circle  but then
8uDahpuiebE,2501040,2506000,we  go like
8uDahpuiebE,2506839,2513920,this kind of a  circle on one side half circle  and then makes a point
8uDahpuiebE,2513920,2519440,so then it looks like you roll it up  just like that
8uDahpuiebE,2519440,2525680,perfect  now  we can take this
8uDahpuiebE,2525680,2530880,whoa we're almost done  all right now let's tape this
8uDahpuiebE,2530880,2538319,to the rocket  my rocket
8uDahpuiebE,2539200,2544319,doesn't look that good but we'll see how  it flies
8uDahpuiebE,2545119,2551440,let's also take some of these from  previous people  and maybe one of these will fly really
8uDahpuiebE,2551440,2556720,good just in case  if  mine doesn't fly
8uDahpuiebE,2556720,2564599,this one looks like it might fly really  good  we'll bring this right over there
