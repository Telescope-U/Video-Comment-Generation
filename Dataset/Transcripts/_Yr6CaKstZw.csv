_Yr6CaKstZw,60,893,"- Oh, wow."
_Yr6CaKstZw,893,4980,I can buy this SSD that's eight terabytes for only $99?
_Yr6CaKstZw,4980,5913,Sold.
_Yr6CaKstZw,8610,10349,"This is a bad idea, isn't it?"
_Yr6CaKstZw,10350,12063,Sponsored by Linode.
_Yr6CaKstZw,13146,15059,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,15060,16230,"Hey guys, how are you all doing?"
_Yr6CaKstZw,16230,17279,"If you're new here, welcome."
_Yr6CaKstZw,17280,19530,My name is Krazy Ken and fake flash drive
_Yr6CaKstZw,19530,22410,in SSD scams have plagued the internet for years
_Yr6CaKstZw,22410,24990,and it's finally time for me to tackle this problem.
_Yr6CaKstZw,24990,27810,We'll take a look at an example of a fake SSD product
_Yr6CaKstZw,27810,30090,and then I'll show you some ways you can spot these things
_Yr6CaKstZw,30090,31680,in the wild so you don't get tricked.
_Yr6CaKstZw,31680,33720,And then I'll show you some tests you can run
_Yr6CaKstZw,33720,36210,so you can see if these things live up to the claims.
_Yr6CaKstZw,36210,39204,So let's take a look at Londoncomfy.
_Yr6CaKstZw,39205,40038,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,40038,40871,I heard about this company from one
_Yr6CaKstZw,40871,42933,"of my viewers, Marianne, from a Twitter DM."
_Yr6CaKstZw,42933,45960,Londoncomfy's website claims they're an English family
_Yr6CaKstZw,45960,48690,business specializing in retail products.
_Yr6CaKstZw,48690,51870,"They have a lot of categories on their website,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,51870,53670,many with broken thumbnails.
_Yr6CaKstZw,53670,56399,"And overall, the giant unfocused list"
_Yr6CaKstZw,56400,59130,of products just has a really cheap feeling to me.
_Yr6CaKstZw,59130,61230,And something that threw me off was this photo
_Yr6CaKstZw,61230,63329,"of their founder, Margot."
_Yr6CaKstZw,63330,66450,When was the last time you saw a real CEO
_Yr6CaKstZw,66450,69479,of a serious company posing with a logo
_Yr6CaKstZw,69480,72330,of his own business on his shirt and on a mug.
_Yr6CaKstZw,72330,74460,That just seems like a stock photo to me.
_Yr6CaKstZw,74460,76650,A quick reverse search proved that.
_Yr6CaKstZw,76650,79230,We can see many other sites using the same model
_Yr6CaKstZw,79230,81030,for their shirt and mug renders.
_Yr6CaKstZw,81030,85170,So we can reasonably conclude this founder is totally fake.
_Yr6CaKstZw,85170,88500,"And if a brand is lying about the founder's name and face,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,88500,91830,I can only imagine what other BS is going on under the hood.
_Yr6CaKstZw,91830,94500,"Oh, and that phone number in the footer, don't even try it."
_Yr6CaKstZw,94500,96150,It doesn't go anywhere.
_Yr6CaKstZw,96150,98820,We're off to a great start and we haven't even tested
_Yr6CaKstZw,98820,99840,the product yet.
_Yr6CaKstZw,99840,103619,"The SSD product page gives you five storage capacities,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,103620,107250,ranging from 500 gigabytes to eight terabytes.
_Yr6CaKstZw,107250,111720,And it claims this SSD is fast with 520 megabyte per second
_Yr6CaKstZw,111720,113010,file transfer speeds.
_Yr6CaKstZw,113010,115140,Is that possible in the real world?
_Yr6CaKstZw,115140,116100,Absolutely.
_Yr6CaKstZw,116100,118260,Solid-state drives typically are faster
_Yr6CaKstZw,118260,120000,than mechanical hard disc drives
_Yr6CaKstZw,120000,122010,and they can store terabytes of information
_Yr6CaKstZw,122010,123540,in a really small space.
_Yr6CaKstZw,123540,126000,Instead of using a platter with magnetic particles
_Yr6CaKstZw,126000,128640,"and an actuator arm, SSD store data"
_Yr6CaKstZw,128640,131220,"in a chip using electrons, a series of gates,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,131220,133170,and more architecture that goes beyond the scope
_Yr6CaKstZw,133170,134250,of this episode.
_Yr6CaKstZw,134250,135960,This allows the drive to store a lot
_Yr6CaKstZw,135960,138540,of data in a compact and quiet space
_Yr6CaKstZw,138540,140969,"and it lets the computer access it really fast,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,140970,143250,but are we truly gonna get fast speeds
_Yr6CaKstZw,143250,145770,and high capacity with this product?
_Yr6CaKstZw,145770,146880,Let's keep digging.
_Yr6CaKstZw,146880,150000,The Londoncomfy website also gives us a fake countdown timer
_Yr6CaKstZw,150000,151620,for the 25% sale.
_Yr6CaKstZw,151620,153720,And this is just a scarcity marketing tactic
_Yr6CaKstZw,153720,155790,to give you some urgency to make you want
_Yr6CaKstZw,155790,157319,to buy immediately.
_Yr6CaKstZw,157320,159120,"Now, I do wanna make a disclaimer about this"
_Yr6CaKstZw,159120,160799,because I've talked about this a lot.
_Yr6CaKstZw,160800,163320,Not all countdown timers are bad.
_Yr6CaKstZw,163320,165540,A countdown timer on a website doesn't automatically
_Yr6CaKstZw,165540,167370,mean a product is a scam.
_Yr6CaKstZw,167370,169500,"There are legitimate uses for them,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,169500,172680,but when a website uses them and they just repeat themselves
_Yr6CaKstZw,172680,174840,over and over and don't actually lead
_Yr6CaKstZw,174840,178349,"to anything that truly expires, that's kind of fishy."
_Yr6CaKstZw,178350,179559,Here's a way you can test that.
_Yr6CaKstZw,179559,180392,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,180392,181650,"Take the webpage you're looking at,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,181650,184019,copy the link and paste it into an incognito
_Yr6CaKstZw,184020,186390,or private browser window and load it up.
_Yr6CaKstZw,186390,190200,"If the timer changes, it's likely a fake countdown timer."
_Yr6CaKstZw,190200,192750,So that's the gist of the Londoncomfy website.
_Yr6CaKstZw,192750,195030,And that brings us to the first real problem
_Yr6CaKstZw,195030,197260,"with this product, the price."
_Yr6CaKstZw,197260,198092,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,198093,199920,The first big red flag for me was they were selling
_Yr6CaKstZw,199920,204920,an eight terabyte 520 megabyte per second SSD for only $99.
_Yr6CaKstZw,205140,206940,That sounds way too good to be true.
_Yr6CaKstZw,206940,209820,"Now, consumers that aren't versed in the tech space,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,209820,213090,"may not realize that, but in reality"
_Yr6CaKstZw,213090,214980,that doesn't make any business sense.
_Yr6CaKstZw,214980,218730,"In 2022, if you were to buy a real eight terabyte M.2"
_Yr6CaKstZw,218730,221370,"form factor solid-state drive, you're gonna spend"
_Yr6CaKstZw,221370,224430,"at least $1,000 on the cheaper end."
_Yr6CaKstZw,224430,227969,If we look at a 2.5 inch form factor with the same capacity
_Yr6CaKstZw,227970,230790,"and similar speeds to what Londoncomfy is advertising,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,230790,233969,you're still looking at about seven times the price.
_Yr6CaKstZw,233970,238050,"So there is no way Londoncomfy is taking $1,000 part,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,238050,240690,cramming it into an enclosure and profiting off
_Yr6CaKstZw,240690,242460,of a $99 sale.
_Yr6CaKstZw,242460,243780,It's impossible.
_Yr6CaKstZw,243780,245640,So always cross check prices.
_Yr6CaKstZw,245640,249030,"If you see a cheap gadget, look it up on another website"
_Yr6CaKstZw,249030,252690,to see what equivalent products are actually selling for.
_Yr6CaKstZw,252690,255570,"And if you need help, feel free to ask someone who you know"
_Yr6CaKstZw,255570,257070,that is more versed in the tech space
_Yr6CaKstZw,257070,259260,because they will have a better sense of the market.
_Yr6CaKstZw,259260,262200,"So with this crazy website, BS countdown timer"
_Yr6CaKstZw,262200,265470,"and ludicrous pricing, you would think I would run away"
_Yr6CaKstZw,265470,268740,"from a product like this, but of course,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,268740,270231,I went ahead and bought one.
_Yr6CaKstZw,270231,271064,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,271064,272970,"I purchased the eight terabyte model and boom,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,272970,275580,the purchase process was actually really easy
_Yr6CaKstZw,275580,278460,and less spam-filled than many of my other investigations.
_Yr6CaKstZw,278460,280410,So I'll give them a gold star there.
_Yr6CaKstZw,280410,281280,And it arrived.
_Yr6CaKstZw,281280,283170,"It took a couple weeks I think,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,283170,285480,but it didn't arrive in that fancy shopping bag
_Yr6CaKstZw,285480,286650,that the website shows.
_Yr6CaKstZw,286650,287550,What a shame.
_Yr6CaKstZw,287550,288750,"Anyway, it's here now."
_Yr6CaKstZw,288750,290218,So let's take a look at it.
_Yr6CaKstZw,290218,291051,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,291051,292949,The box has no brand names or any mention
_Yr6CaKstZw,292950,295530,of Londoncomfy which is not surprising because this
_Yr6CaKstZw,295530,298320,is likely just a generic product from China.
_Yr6CaKstZw,298320,300030,"Oh, made in China."
_Yr6CaKstZw,300030,300863,Look at that.
_Yr6CaKstZw,300863,304860,"And the box advertises USB 3.1 speeds,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,304860,308069,"which in theory would offer pretty fast data transfer rates,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,308070,310140,but we'll test that out soon.
_Yr6CaKstZw,310140,313290,"And inside the box, we get the drive, the USB cable"
_Yr6CaKstZw,313290,314700,and two adapters.
_Yr6CaKstZw,314700,317700,USB-A to C and USB-A to Micro B.
_Yr6CaKstZw,317700,319470,And these instructions.
_Yr6CaKstZw,319470,321900,"When using desktop computers, data wires need"
_Yr6CaKstZw,321900,324960,to be connected to the USB interface behind
_Yr6CaKstZw,324960,327479,"the main cabinet, like a filing cabinet."
_Yr6CaKstZw,327480,330810,The power supply on the tront USB interface
_Yr6CaKstZw,330810,332643,is generally unstable.
_Yr6CaKstZw,333810,335700,"Butter fingers, who am I, Linus Tech Tips?"
_Yr6CaKstZw,335700,338430,Don't shake the body when accessing data
_Yr6CaKstZw,338430,342479,"with a mobile hard disc, like the body of the SSD"
_Yr6CaKstZw,342480,344670,or just like your body in general.
_Yr6CaKstZw,344670,347310,"Don't do this when using a hard drive, it's very dangerous."
_Yr6CaKstZw,347310,349680,"Number four, don't fall."
_Yr6CaKstZw,349680,350940,Like in general?
_Yr6CaKstZw,350940,354063,"I mean, yeah, that's generally good advice."
_Yr6CaKstZw,355020,357210,"So physically, the device looks okay."
_Yr6CaKstZw,357210,358350,It's got a metal finish.
_Yr6CaKstZw,358350,361530,"It's small and compact, but now let's plug it in"
_Yr6CaKstZw,361530,363222,and test it for real.
_Yr6CaKstZw,363222,364055,(duck quacking)
_Yr6CaKstZw,364055,365759,"Oh, they spelt flash wrong."
_Yr6CaKstZw,365760,367366,It's gonna be a long day.
_Yr6CaKstZw,367366,368199,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,368199,370980,"Anyway, I tried formatting this thing to HFS Plus."
_Yr6CaKstZw,370980,372510,The process took about two minutes
_Yr6CaKstZw,372510,374520,when it usually takes a few seconds.
_Yr6CaKstZw,374520,376110,"Ultimately, the formatting finished"
_Yr6CaKstZw,376110,379199,and I ran Blackmagic's Disk Speed Test on the drive.
_Yr6CaKstZw,379200,381960,And the speeds were atrocious.
_Yr6CaKstZw,381960,385050,One megabyte per second write and the read test
_Yr6CaKstZw,385050,386819,wouldn't even execute.
_Yr6CaKstZw,386820,389160,I reformatted the drive as ExFAT and tried again
_Yr6CaKstZw,389160,393900,"and funny enough, it got 11.3 write and about 18 read."
_Yr6CaKstZw,393900,396780,Better but still total crap.
_Yr6CaKstZw,396780,398130,"Side note, if you're on Windows,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,398130,400890,you can use CrystalDiskMark to test your drive speeds.
_Yr6CaKstZw,400890,402960,So the speed claims are false.
_Yr6CaKstZw,402960,404430,And in the real world if you were trying
_Yr6CaKstZw,404430,407340,"to do serious work with this thing with large files,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,407340,409830,"it would be practically impossible to do that,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,409830,411870,but I didn't stop there.
_Yr6CaKstZw,411870,414449,I opened this device up in the macOS System Information
_Yr6CaKstZw,414450,416310,application and the speed registered
_Yr6CaKstZw,416310,420120,"as 480 megabits per second, which is the theoretical speed"
_Yr6CaKstZw,420120,423840,"of the older USB 2.0 standard, which is much slower than"
_Yr6CaKstZw,423840,426600,"what's advertised, USB 3.1."
_Yr6CaKstZw,426600,430290,"If this was truly a USB 3.1 Gen 1 device,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,430290,433470,"that speed would register as five gigabits per second,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,433470,435720,about 10 times faster theoretically.
_Yr6CaKstZw,435720,438000,So we have doubled confirmed that the speed
_Yr6CaKstZw,438000,440010,claims are false.
_Yr6CaKstZw,440010,442983,"Certainly this product can't get any worse, right?"
_Yr6CaKstZw,444690,446402,Let's test the capacity.
_Yr6CaKstZw,446402,447235,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,447235,450120,I'm using a Windows program called H2testw.
_Yr6CaKstZw,450120,453750,This test writes thousands of one gigabyte files to the SSD
_Yr6CaKstZw,453750,456510,and then it verifies them to calculate the true capacity
_Yr6CaKstZw,456510,457380,of the device.
_Yr6CaKstZw,457380,460590,"For a control, I tested a USB flash drive that I trust"
_Yr6CaKstZw,460590,462480,and the test showed no errors.
_Yr6CaKstZw,462480,464340,"Great, moving on."
_Yr6CaKstZw,464340,468270,"For this eight terabyte drive, the test needs about 96 hours"
_Yr6CaKstZw,468270,471000,to run because the drive speed is so slow
_Yr6CaKstZw,471000,473580,and it has a lot of bites to read and write.
_Yr6CaKstZw,473580,476520,"And of course, Windows Update rebooted the computer"
_Yr6CaKstZw,476520,477720,in the middle of the test so I had
_Yr6CaKstZw,477720,479430,to restart from the halfway point.
_Yr6CaKstZw,479430,482130,"Thanks Windows, it's not like I have anything better"
_Yr6CaKstZw,482130,483930,to do with my life.
_Yr6CaKstZw,483930,487080,"Actually I don't, so whatever, but don't worry."
_Yr6CaKstZw,487080,489120,I pressed that pause updates button
_Yr6CaKstZw,489120,491250,so now we should be fine.
_Yr6CaKstZw,491250,493740,The test ran for 39 more hours
_Yr6CaKstZw,493740,495419,and then it got interrupted again.
_Yr6CaKstZw,495420,498330,I think because I bumped the USB cable.
_Yr6CaKstZw,498330,501090,"It fits really loose compared to a normal cable,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,501090,502710,but that doesn't surprise me.
_Yr6CaKstZw,502710,504539,This thing is a cheap piece of crap.
_Yr6CaKstZw,504540,506370,Either way I had the data I needed
_Yr6CaKstZw,506370,509310,and I couldn't justify restarting the test again
_Yr6CaKstZw,509310,511260,because it takes days to run.
_Yr6CaKstZw,511260,515729,The final results shows 58.2 gigabytes of data is okay
_Yr6CaKstZw,515729,518669,and 3.1 terabytes of data was lost.
_Yr6CaKstZw,518669,522180,And 164 gigabytes of data was overwritten out
_Yr6CaKstZw,522180,525420,of a total 3.37 terabytes verified.
_Yr6CaKstZw,525420,528839,So only 58.2 gigabytes of data can actually be stored
_Yr6CaKstZw,528840,531510,on here which is actually way less than I thought it
_Yr6CaKstZw,531510,532343,was gonna be.
_Yr6CaKstZw,532343,534300,"I was giving this product too much credit,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,534300,537360,but I wanted to go beyond just a test program.
_Yr6CaKstZw,537360,540240,"Now, I wanna try this out with a real world application,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,540240,542933,"something I do all the time, video editing."
_Yr6CaKstZw,542933,543766,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,543766,546300,I reformatted the drive as HFS Plus for macOS
_Yr6CaKstZw,546300,550200,"and I'm copying an over 400 gigabyte final cut pro,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,550200,552750,video editing library onto the drive.
_Yr6CaKstZw,552750,556380,"The transfer was incredibly slow, but on the surface"
_Yr6CaKstZw,556380,558780,"it looks like it finished with no errors,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,558780,561330,but of course the data was behaving erratically.
_Yr6CaKstZw,561330,564300,The final cut library size was reported incorrectly
_Yr6CaKstZw,564300,566880,in the Quick Look window compared to the Finder window.
_Yr6CaKstZw,566880,569070,And the library would not open either.
_Yr6CaKstZw,569070,572760,I dug into the library bundle to examine individual files.
_Yr6CaKstZw,572760,576360,"A movie file that was within the 58.2 gigabyte limit,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,576360,578670,actually opens successfully which checks out with
_Yr6CaKstZw,578670,582269,"the test results, but all other movie files were corrupted."
_Yr6CaKstZw,582270,585660,"So despite showing up in the OS as an eight terabyte volume,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,585660,589290,it can actually only handle 58.2 gigabytes which
_Yr6CaKstZw,589290,593550,is less than 1% of the advertised capacity.
_Yr6CaKstZw,593550,596670,So how is this thing tricking the OS?
_Yr6CaKstZw,596670,597873,Here's how that works.
_Yr6CaKstZw,597874,598707,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,598707,601470,The flash storage chips on an SSD board need a brain
_Yr6CaKstZw,601470,603689,to communicate with the rest of the computer.
_Yr6CaKstZw,603690,605790,This brain is a controller which
_Yr6CaKstZw,605790,609029,is generally a separate SOC or a system-on-a-chip
_Yr6CaKstZw,609030,610080,on the board.
_Yr6CaKstZw,610080,612510,The controller uses a firmware so it can function
_Yr6CaKstZw,612510,614040,and communicate properly.
_Yr6CaKstZw,614040,615750,And firmware is a type of software that
_Yr6CaKstZw,615750,617820,is programmed directly into a piece of hardware.
_Yr6CaKstZw,617820,620190,"However, this firmware can be programmed"
_Yr6CaKstZw,620190,622680,in a misleading way so the controller tells
_Yr6CaKstZw,622680,624660,the OS the incorrect capacity.
_Yr6CaKstZw,624660,627300,"And as I have shown, this SSD does not give you"
_Yr6CaKstZw,627300,629399,the advertised speed or capacity.
_Yr6CaKstZw,629400,631500,It's not even close.
_Yr6CaKstZw,631500,633540,So let's bust this thing open to see
_Yr6CaKstZw,633540,635370,if we can find out what parts it's using
_Yr6CaKstZw,635370,637620,and maybe that will give us some more clues
_Yr6CaKstZw,637620,640200,as to why this thing sucks so much.
_Yr6CaKstZw,640200,641730,"And first, I have to give a special thanks"
_Yr6CaKstZw,641730,645209,"to Noah-n Cares, Lane Wallen, and Toby The Greatish."
_Yr6CaKstZw,645210,646860,You guys helped me research this episode
_Yr6CaKstZw,646860,648779,and I appreciate that very much.
_Yr6CaKstZw,648780,651614,"All right, now let's bust this thing open."
_Yr6CaKstZw,651614,654900,(upbeat music)
_Yr6CaKstZw,654900,658440,"Okay, so this thing is just filled with glue."
_Yr6CaKstZw,658440,661230,It really looks like they don't want you getting inside
_Yr6CaKstZw,661230,665040,or that was just their lazy way of securing the components.
_Yr6CaKstZw,665040,667829,So the glue was a problem and I've seen some mixed results
_Yr6CaKstZw,667830,670230,"about using alcohol to dissolve the glue,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,670230,672930,but I have heard that heat works okay.
_Yr6CaKstZw,672930,674820,"Unfortunately, I didn't realize that until"
_Yr6CaKstZw,674820,677370,after I busted out my caveman skills
_Yr6CaKstZw,677370,680400,and kind of just cut and smashed the thing to pieces.
_Yr6CaKstZw,680400,683250,So unfortunately we just have some remains
_Yr6CaKstZw,683250,687180,"in this baggy here, but still it helps get my point across."
_Yr6CaKstZw,687180,689910,This thing is literally just a micro SD board
_Yr6CaKstZw,689910,691920,that adapts to USB-C.
_Yr6CaKstZw,691920,693930,"Here's the card smashed in the process,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,693930,697380,"but you can see by the contacts, this is a micro SD card,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,697380,699510,not an M.2 SSD.
_Yr6CaKstZw,699510,702060,And that surprised me because I thought it was just gonna
_Yr6CaKstZw,702060,704550,be a cheap storage medium like you'd find
_Yr6CaKstZw,704550,707640,"in a USB 2.0 pen drive or something, but no,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,707640,710910,it's literally just a micro SD card.
_Yr6CaKstZw,710910,713040,And I'm going to guess this chip is the controller
_Yr6CaKstZw,713040,714720,that has the fakey firmware on it.
_Yr6CaKstZw,714720,717600,And what's amusing is the scammers shaped the enclosure
_Yr6CaKstZw,717600,720630,"to make it look like an M.2 SSD would fit in there,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,720630,723720,but clearly this board doesn't fit that spec.
_Yr6CaKstZw,723720,726060,I should also mention Atomic Shrimp recently dropped
_Yr6CaKstZw,726060,727500,an episode about this topic.
_Yr6CaKstZw,727500,728940,So feel free to check that out too.
_Yr6CaKstZw,728940,731160,"Coincidentally, he dropped that episode"
_Yr6CaKstZw,731160,732959,while I was working on my own.
_Yr6CaKstZw,732960,735510,Almost as if he's spying on me.
_Yr6CaKstZw,735510,737430,"Relax Ken, no one is spying on you."
_Yr6CaKstZw,737430,739710,"I know that, I'm not paranoid."
_Yr6CaKstZw,739710,741750,"Anyway, yeah, it's a piece of crap,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,741750,744570,"but if you use Linode, they will give you the speeds"
_Yr6CaKstZw,744570,746880,and capacity that you actually pay for.
_Yr6CaKstZw,746880,747840,They do it right.
_Yr6CaKstZw,747840,749940,If you have an application or a website that you need
_Yr6CaKstZw,749940,752640,"to scale or deploy, Linode has the infrastructure"
_Yr6CaKstZw,752640,755490,"and the 24/7 support you need, but the cool thing is,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,755490,757505,Linode is much more than just data centers.
_Yr6CaKstZw,757505,758338,(air whooshing)
_Yr6CaKstZw,758338,761610,"Linode offers out of box apps for game servers like TF2,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,761610,763890,"CS:GO, and even Minecraft."
_Yr6CaKstZw,763890,766770,"You can run your own virtual private network with OpenVPN,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,766770,768870,build an online application with Joomla's content
_Yr6CaKstZw,768870,771270,management system or build a video streaming site
_Yr6CaKstZw,771270,772920,with a multitude of app choices.
_Yr6CaKstZw,772920,775260,There's so much you can do with Linode's affordable
_Yr6CaKstZw,775260,776730,Linux virtual machines.
_Yr6CaKstZw,776730,778620,"And to boot, they offer award-winning"
_Yr6CaKstZw,778620,780360,24/7 technical support.
_Yr6CaKstZw,780360,783690,"To put it simply, if it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode."
_Yr6CaKstZw,783690,785820,Visit linode.com/computerclan and click
_Yr6CaKstZw,785820,787050,the create free account button.
_Yr6CaKstZw,787050,790410,"And when you do that, I'll give you a 60-day $100 credit,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,790410,792720,"just for watching this episode, pretty good deal."
_Yr6CaKstZw,792720,795180,And you're also supporting the Computer Clan.
_Yr6CaKstZw,795180,796350,So thank you very much.
_Yr6CaKstZw,796350,799800,So be wary of those fake SSDs and flash drives.
_Yr6CaKstZw,799800,803010,And the biggest red flag I would say is the price.
_Yr6CaKstZw,803010,805170,"Check those prices 'cause after all,"
_Yr6CaKstZw,805170,807930,"if it looks too good to be true, it probably is."
_Yr6CaKstZw,807930,809670,"Well, that was a lot to go through."
_Yr6CaKstZw,809670,812130,Now I have to store all of this footage for this episode.
_Yr6CaKstZw,812130,814852,"Well, I hope I used a reliable SSD"
_Yr6CaKstZw,814852,816592,Ha ha ha ha
_Yr6CaKstZw,816592,819175,(upbeat music)
