ERJHNeXSMww,13440,19479,come on in  [Music]
ERJHNeXSMww,22020,29840,[Music]  hey  it's me today is a long
ERJHNeXSMww,29840,36000,it is my art room tour  hey  i officially switched to this art room
ERJHNeXSMww,36000,42640,because i moved back in the summer so  i've been in here for like six months
ERJHNeXSMww,42640,47920,obviously the last art room tour that i  did was of my old art room it was also
ERJHNeXSMww,47920,54719,in 2019 i believe so things have changed  so many big changes like
ERJHNeXSMww,54719,60000,the fact that my hair is shorter among  other things i'm sure but i can't really
ERJHNeXSMww,60000,66560,think of them right now right the room  is very different i'm going to show it  to you in detail everything i personally
ERJHNeXSMww,66560,74240,actually really love watching art room  tours love it for me the only way to do  in our room tour is to show everything i
ERJHNeXSMww,74240,80799,want to see your drawers what's in there  what's in there show me your underwear  probably just because i'm very nosy no i
ERJHNeXSMww,80799,86479,like to say curious curious better word  than nosy so i'm gonna show you guys all  that which means this is probably going
ERJHNeXSMww,86479,93759,to take a long time the last art tour  that i did in fact i had to break it up  into a two-parter i'm gonna try to avoid
ERJHNeXSMww,93759,100560,that but my art room is bigger now and i  still talk way too much so
ERJHNeXSMww,100560,106159,oh my gosh i didn't bring my water  bottle down here how am i gonna live i  will die let me just acknowledge this
ERJHNeXSMww,106159,111840,art room is way more than i could have  ever asked for it is outrageous and just
ERJHNeXSMww,111840,117360,wonderful so um thank you because you  guys gave it to me pretty much by
ERJHNeXSMww,117360,124560,watching all my videos and allowing me  to continue doing what i do i love this  room there is just so much open space to
ERJHNeXSMww,124560,129759,do so many different things very  important critical things this art room
ERJHNeXSMww,129759,136640,is once again located in my basement  i've always been a basement worker i  started in a basement and here i am
ERJHNeXSMww,136640,142480,still in a basement so i'm very  comfortable in the basement why is it  hot in here though first upgrade from my
ERJHNeXSMww,142480,149280,old art room though is there's a door a  lovely lovely large door also has a lock
ERJHNeXSMww,149280,155040,on it which is amazing i just love  having a door love a good door the  second thing that's very different from
ERJHNeXSMww,155040,160640,my old setup is that it's a very large  open space before i actually had two
ERJHNeXSMww,160640,166400,rooms that i was working on my main art  room and then i usually called it the  blue couch room that's where i would do
ERJHNeXSMww,166400,173200,you know unboxing videos and i use it  for storage this space is big enough to  have everything in one space i have
ERJHNeXSMww,173200,178319,three different filming areas area  number one in front of my squishy shelf
ERJHNeXSMww,178319,184400,where i do my intros and art things to  do when you're bored and that kind of  stuff area number two is where i paint i
ERJHNeXSMww,184400,191280,have two tables and like kind of an l so  that allows a lot of surface area for me  to lay out all my stuff all of my paint
ERJHNeXSMww,191280,196800,all of my tools then finally area number  three is right back there it is where
ERJHNeXSMww,196800,204080,you see my blue couch for  unboxing videos and q and a's and kind  of like sit down more chatty videos or
ERJHNeXSMww,204080,210799,whatever it's on this little stage that  was in here before and i kind of feel  like i'm a performer so that's kind of
ERJHNeXSMww,210799,216239,the overview of what i've got going on  here so now it is time to deep dive
ERJHNeXSMww,216239,221440,into every different area of this room  and i'm overwhelmed already ready
ERJHNeXSMww,221440,226959,there's a lot  this is gonna be a long long day i'm  gonna kick you out you'll have to be let
ERJHNeXSMww,226959,232799,in and then we will start the tour from  there let's do that get out of here go
ERJHNeXSMww,232799,239460,okay so this is the outside of the door  very very nice door
ERJHNeXSMww,239460,246159,[Music]
ERJHNeXSMww,246159,252640,i don't know what the the sweeping thing  is it just was creepy lighting and so i  wanted to do something creepy okay so
ERJHNeXSMww,252640,259600,we're inside the room now we're gonna  start by going to the right of the door  and the first thing we see is my little
ERJHNeXSMww,259600,265280,shelf  checking for dust i painted this in one  of my thrift store makeovers and isn't

ERJHNeXSMww,270320,276320,cabinets let's start with the top  cabinet up here i have my two green  screens i basically never use them
ERJHNeXSMww,276320,284880,anymore except of course to occasionally  sleep in then over here i have this very  old camera oh my gosh really in with the
ERJHNeXSMww,284880,291120,drama i completely forgot that this is  what that looks like this is like the  camera that i made my original videos on
ERJHNeXSMww,291120,298160,bye and this is my first display shelf  all of these i've made except for this  this someone made for me a really long

ERJHNeXSMww,384800,391680,everything up because i cannot start  fresh unless everything is put away so  my art room really doesn't get like
ERJHNeXSMww,391680,399680,crazy for the most part there might be a  few little micro messes now for the  first drawer this drawer is basically
ERJHNeXSMww,399680,406319,all finished artwork these are not my  pride and joy best portfolio pieces  right here this was an experiment okay
ERJHNeXSMww,406319,412240,this is not what my art normally looks  like  this is all just like flat artwork the
ERJHNeXSMww,412240,420160,original drawing of galactica this  no-name character that we all forgot  about who dad i never attached the frame
ERJHNeXSMww,420160,425599,to this that's not responsible oh this  was on my wall bean pickle this

ERJHNeXSMww,1179440,1184640,used and then over here i have paper  clay i think is what it's called
ERJHNeXSMww,1184640,1190000,sand magnets and glass cabochons i feel  like these styrofoam things should go
ERJHNeXSMww,1190000,1195200,with my big fat styrofoam balls these  this makes more sense

ERJHNeXSMww,1258080,1264000,problem moving down here another shelf  where i'm not super happy with how these
ERJHNeXSMww,1264000,1271440,things look together maybe it's because  none of this stuff is really like my  favorite except for those little acorns  i love those little acorns the cup the
ERJHNeXSMww,1271440,1277679,base this thing  finally this shelf with many different
ERJHNeXSMww,1277679,1284080,little pouches kiwi that's a kiwi right  that was merchandise this was  merchandise at one point this was

ERJHNeXSMww,1306880,1312880,make cracking squishies  i don't even know now that i'm thinking
ERJHNeXSMww,1312880,1318799,about it it's kind of dumb this crusty  bag has all my sandpaper in it  toothpicks which come in handy and then
ERJHNeXSMww,1318799,1326880,the rest of this is all custom mixed  paint probably need to go through this  because there are probably quite a few

ERJHNeXSMww,1431279,1437120,my painted paint palettes regrets  painting a glossy top coat on these
ERJHNeXSMww,1437120,1442320,because it is so hard to film them the  glare is so obnoxious and annoying
