QtX2_HYiIqI,372,2070,(upbeat music)
QtX2_HYiIqI,2070,2903,- Sing.
QtX2_HYiIqI,4440,5273,Learn.
QtX2_HYiIqI,7240,8073,Create.
QtX2_HYiIqI,9960,13763,And play in Caitie's classroom.
QtX2_HYiIqI,15690,16963,"Hi, everyone."
QtX2_HYiIqI,16964,19840,Come on into the classroom.
QtX2_HYiIqI,19840,22210,It's great to see you.
QtX2_HYiIqI,22210,25162,We aren't the only ones in the classroom today.
QtX2_HYiIqI,26380,31380,"Today, there are lots of little creatures all over."
QtX2_HYiIqI,31910,32923,Can you see them?
QtX2_HYiIqI,35180,36633,Let's take a closer look.
QtX2_HYiIqI,40856,41689,Do you see it?
QtX2_HYiIqI,42580,46920,There's another one and another one.
QtX2_HYiIqI,46920,50280,"Whoa, there's lots of bugs."
QtX2_HYiIqI,51513,54970,Bugs are really interesting creatures.
QtX2_HYiIqI,54970,59370,"We have a lot of amazing things to explore today,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,59370,63282,but first let's wave a big hello to all our friends.
QtX2_HYiIqI,67300,68713,Let's wave and sing.
QtX2_HYiIqI,71184,76184,"♪ Hello, hello, what's your name ♪"
QtX2_HYiIqI,76720,81720,"♪ Hello, hello, what's your name ♪"
QtX2_HYiIqI,82000,84880,♪ My name is Caitie ♪
QtX2_HYiIqI,84880,86162,What's your name?
QtX2_HYiIqI,87132,87965,Shout it out.
QtX2_HYiIqI,91396,95077,♪ Nice to meet you. ♪
QtX2_HYiIqI,95077,97994,♪ Let's be friends ♪
QtX2_HYiIqI,99546,100463,Hi friends.
QtX2_HYiIqI,105130,107433,Lots of bugs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,108925,111890,Bugs might seem like creepy crawlers
QtX2_HYiIqI,111890,114413,but usually they just want to be left alone.
QtX2_HYiIqI,115750,119360,"When I see a bug outside, I try and leave it alone"
QtX2_HYiIqI,119360,122140,and give it lots of room.
QtX2_HYiIqI,122140,125663,"I don't bother the bug, and bugs don't bother me."
QtX2_HYiIqI,126570,129890,"There are lots of different kinds of bugs, too."
QtX2_HYiIqI,129890,134890,"There are over 900,000 different kinds of bugs,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,135090,136890,all different kinds.
QtX2_HYiIqI,136890,139690,Some have lots of legs
QtX2_HYiIqI,139690,141520,and some have wings
QtX2_HYiIqI,143720,147347,and some have spots like this bug.
QtX2_HYiIqI,147347,149040,(whimsical music)
QtX2_HYiIqI,149040,150523,It's a ladybug.
QtX2_HYiIqI,151920,154023,Have you seen a ladybug before?
QtX2_HYiIqI,154940,158890,ladybugs are red with black spots.
QtX2_HYiIqI,158890,161883,Let's count how many spots this ladybug has.
QtX2_HYiIqI,163400,167532,"I see one, two, three,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,168660,173660,"four, five, six, seven."
QtX2_HYiIqI,175060,178790,"Seven spots, great counting."
QtX2_HYiIqI,178790,181663,ladybugs also have wings.
QtX2_HYiIqI,183630,185400,Look at that.
QtX2_HYiIqI,185400,187769,"They fold up their wings,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,187770,191580,so we usually don't see them unless they're flying.
QtX2_HYiIqI,191580,194610,Let's pretend to fly like a ladybug.
QtX2_HYiIqI,194610,198853,Stretch out your wings and fly like a ladybug.
QtX2_HYiIqI,202620,204959,Great flying everybody.
QtX2_HYiIqI,204960,207063,You all make great ladybugs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,209309,211373,"Oh, look at this bug."
QtX2_HYiIqI,213620,215583,This is a type of beetle.
QtX2_HYiIqI,216870,221090,"There are lots and lots of different types of beetles,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,221090,224730,but they all have the same amount of legs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,224730,227373,Let's count how many legs a beetle has.
QtX2_HYiIqI,229731,234731,"One, two, three, four, five, six, six legs."
QtX2_HYiIqI,237910,241293,Let's pretend to make six legs using our fingers.
QtX2_HYiIqI,242350,245780,"Three over here, three over here."
QtX2_HYiIqI,245780,250393,We can make our beetle crawl around on six legs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,253175,254425,Look at him go.
QtX2_HYiIqI,255900,258810,"Ooh, look at this bug."
QtX2_HYiIqI,258810,260483,We know what this is.
QtX2_HYiIqI,262260,263803,It's a spider.
QtX2_HYiIqI,265330,268522,Let's count how many legs a spider has.
QtX2_HYiIqI,270110,275000,"A spider has one, two, three,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,275000,280000,"four, five, six, seven, eight legs."
QtX2_HYiIqI,282250,283993,Great counting everybody.
QtX2_HYiIqI,284870,287889,I know a song about a spider.
QtX2_HYiIqI,287890,291470,When we sing it we can move our hands
QtX2_HYiIqI,291470,295513,to make a spider crawling up the water spout.
QtX2_HYiIqI,296480,298220,I'll show you how.
QtX2_HYiIqI,298220,303160,Try making two Ls with your fingers and thumbs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,303160,308160,And turn one upside down and twist your fingers up like this
QtX2_HYiIqI,309987,313103,to make a crawling spider.
QtX2_HYiIqI,314600,315433,That's it.
QtX2_HYiIqI,316780,320453,"Let's sing ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"" together."
QtX2_HYiIqI,321820,322653,Follow me.

QtX2_HYiIqI,350980,352283,Are your spiders ready?
QtX2_HYiIqI,353370,354233,Here we go.

QtX2_HYiIqI,379930,382780,We can sing in a low voice like this.
QtX2_HYiIqI,385571,390571,"♪ The big, big spider went up the water spout ♪"

QtX2_HYiIqI,468793,473010,♪ Then the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again ♪
QtX2_HYiIqI,473010,474943,That was a fast spider.
QtX2_HYiIqI,476457,478863,"Give yourselves a big clap, nice job."
QtX2_HYiIqI,479960,483039,"So many different kinds of spiders,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,483040,486963,"big ones, teeny ones and fast ones, too."
QtX2_HYiIqI,488260,491950,There are so many different kinds of bugs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,491950,496600,Did you know there are way more bugs on Earth
QtX2_HYiIqI,496600,498730,than there are people?
QtX2_HYiIqI,498730,502270,"It's true, but we don't see them all the time"
QtX2_HYiIqI,502270,504310,because they're so small.
QtX2_HYiIqI,504310,506900,And a lot of them live under rocks
QtX2_HYiIqI,506900,509550,or in the Earth where we can't see them.
QtX2_HYiIqI,509550,514550,"But if we go looking for them, we might find a whole bunch."
QtX2_HYiIqI,514860,518802,Let's go looking for bugs in the discovery bin.
QtX2_HYiIqI,522890,527890,"Ooh, The discovery bin is filled with some dirt."
QtX2_HYiIqI,528200,530860,Lots of other things from outside.
QtX2_HYiIqI,530860,531972,Can you see any bugs?
QtX2_HYiIqI,533810,535293,"Oh, I see a ladybug."
QtX2_HYiIqI,536470,539154,There's lots of different bugs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,539155,543070,"Wow, but there's always more hiding around."
QtX2_HYiIqI,543070,545635,So let's dig and see what we can find.
QtX2_HYiIqI,545635,548218,(upbeat music)
QtX2_HYiIqI,549639,551209,Do you see this?
QtX2_HYiIqI,551210,553373,"Look at this, we found one."
QtX2_HYiIqI,554831,557850,"Whoa, this bug has lots of little legs."
QtX2_HYiIqI,559000,559973,There you go.
QtX2_HYiIqI,561180,564839,Having bugs in the soil is really good for the plants.
QtX2_HYiIqI,564840,565803,Helps them grow.
QtX2_HYiIqI,566920,570329,Bugs also like to hide under rocks.
QtX2_HYiIqI,570330,571230,Let's take a look.
QtX2_HYiIqI,572950,574393,Nothing there.
QtX2_HYiIqI,575769,576686,Maybe here?
QtX2_HYiIqI,578067,580083,"Whoa, look at this bug."
QtX2_HYiIqI,581070,582883,It's an orange color.
QtX2_HYiIqI,584390,585623,It looks really neat.
QtX2_HYiIqI,586830,587663,Here we go.
QtX2_HYiIqI,589328,590830,Do you see this one?
QtX2_HYiIqI,590830,592150,It's hiding under the moss.
QtX2_HYiIqI,592150,593490,Let's take a closer look.
QtX2_HYiIqI,597011,600633,"Bugs are so different, they're so interesting."
QtX2_HYiIqI,601920,604850,"Well, I bet there's something under this big rock."
QtX2_HYiIqI,604850,606709,Should we take a look?
QtX2_HYiIqI,606710,608493,"Let's see, here we go."
QtX2_HYiIqI,610560,612970,"Yeah, we know that this is."
QtX2_HYiIqI,612970,614282,Has eight legs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,615260,617948,"A spider, yeah."
QtX2_HYiIqI,617948,620248,"There you go little spider, back in your home."
QtX2_HYiIqI,621400,623890,Let's try looking under the leaves.
QtX2_HYiIqI,623890,625853,You never know what you might find.
QtX2_HYiIqI,627600,629793,"Ah, look at this one."
QtX2_HYiIqI,631060,635500,I actually made this bug from a rock I found outside.
QtX2_HYiIqI,635500,638450,I painted it and decorated it to look like a little beetle.
QtX2_HYiIqI,639490,643010,I'll show you how you can make a rock bug like this at home.
QtX2_HYiIqI,643010,645655,Let's gather the things we need.
QtX2_HYiIqI,645655,646931,(energetic music)
QtX2_HYiIqI,646931,650250,Some things we need for this craft are cotton swabs
QtX2_HYiIqI,652180,653563,"googly eyes,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,655930,657943,"some smooth rocks,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,660840,662490,and a grownup.
QtX2_HYiIqI,662490,666399,You can find your rocks to make our rock bugs outside.
QtX2_HYiIqI,666400,669600,A nice smooth round rock works really well.
QtX2_HYiIqI,669600,670889,I like this one.
QtX2_HYiIqI,670890,675500,"Once it's clean, we want to paint it white."
QtX2_HYiIqI,675500,678240,And that's because it makes whatever color
QtX2_HYiIqI,678240,682053,we paint our rock bug look really bright.
QtX2_HYiIqI,683000,686400,Instead of just painting right on the gray rock.
QtX2_HYiIqI,686400,690470,I'm gonna paint our rock bug red.
QtX2_HYiIqI,690470,693129,Can you guess what bug I'm gonna make?
QtX2_HYiIqI,693130,694713,What bug is the color red?
QtX2_HYiIqI,696550,698959,"A ladybug, yeah."
QtX2_HYiIqI,698960,700970,We'll paint our whole rock.
QtX2_HYiIqI,700970,704803,"It's a little tricky to paint a rock, but really fun."
QtX2_HYiIqI,706060,707963,"Once it's all covered,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,709030,710930,then we'll leave that to dry.
QtX2_HYiIqI,710930,711763,That looks good.
QtX2_HYiIqI,713891,717170,"And once it's dry, we can decorate it."
QtX2_HYiIqI,717170,721370,"So to make our ladybug, can use some black paint"
QtX2_HYiIqI,722370,725033,to make a little head for our ladybug.
QtX2_HYiIqI,726050,727483,"Here we go, a black head."
QtX2_HYiIqI,729410,731980,And we'll make a line down the middle.
QtX2_HYiIqI,731980,736720,Remember ladybugs have two wings.
QtX2_HYiIqI,736720,737553,There we go.
QtX2_HYiIqI,739200,740623,What else do ladybugs have?
QtX2_HYiIqI,741560,746512,"Spots, but to make perfect round spots"
QtX2_HYiIqI,746512,751103,you can use a cotton swab dipped in some black paint.
QtX2_HYiIqI,752079,753623,"Boop, boop, boop."
QtX2_HYiIqI,754890,757620,"There we go, got some polka dots."
QtX2_HYiIqI,757620,762100,Now let's give our ladybug some googly eyes.
QtX2_HYiIqI,762100,764199,We'll add those with a little bit of glue.
QtX2_HYiIqI,765867,766700,"One,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,769413,770246,two.
QtX2_HYiIqI,772568,773568,There we go.
QtX2_HYiIqI,775840,779270,"Oh, hello, little ladybug."
QtX2_HYiIqI,779270,781083,What a cute little ladybug we made.
QtX2_HYiIqI,782520,785450,You can make any kind of bug you like.
QtX2_HYiIqI,785450,790450,Maybe a beetle or a buzzing bumblebee.
QtX2_HYiIqI,791640,795850,You can even try making up your own special kind of bug.
QtX2_HYiIqI,795850,798623,I can't wait to see what bugs you make at home.
QtX2_HYiIqI,799510,803413,Let's go on a field trip to see some real bugs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,804570,807080,We might even be able to hold them.
QtX2_HYiIqI,807080,809260,What do you think of that?
QtX2_HYiIqI,809260,811900,"The bugs we'll see on this field trip are special,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,811900,813910,friendly kinds of bugs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,813910,814743,Let's go.
QtX2_HYiIqI,816472,819972,"(""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"")"
QtX2_HYiIqI,822510,823470,"Hi, everybody."
QtX2_HYiIqI,823470,826279,We are here at the Cambridge Butterfly Conservatory
QtX2_HYiIqI,826280,828250,"with our friend, Jen, who's gonna show us"
QtX2_HYiIqI,828250,831040,some of her cool bugs that she has here.
QtX2_HYiIqI,831040,832940,- Come on and meet our insect friends.
QtX2_HYiIqI,833890,835560,"- Wow, what bug is this?"
QtX2_HYiIqI,835560,837930,- This is a thorny devil walking stick.
QtX2_HYiIqI,837930,839470,We call her Teresa.
QtX2_HYiIqI,839470,840959,"- Hi, Teresa."
QtX2_HYiIqI,840960,844870,"Wow, a thorny devil walking stick."
QtX2_HYiIqI,844870,847370,'Cause it kind of looks like a stick
QtX2_HYiIqI,847370,849700,"and it has these thorns on it here, too."
QtX2_HYiIqI,849700,851010,"- Yeah, they help to protect her"
QtX2_HYiIqI,851010,853650,so that things like birds and other creatures in the wild
QtX2_HYiIqI,853650,854890,don't want to eat her.
QtX2_HYiIqI,854890,856180,- Do you think I could hold Theresa?
QtX2_HYiIqI,856180,857200,- For sure.
QtX2_HYiIqI,857200,858970,- Okay. - She's really friendly.
QtX2_HYiIqI,858970,860449,"Come on, Theresa."
QtX2_HYiIqI,860450,863480,- [Caitie] Remember these are special friendly bugs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,863480,865139,If you see bugs like this somewhere
QtX2_HYiIqI,865140,866750,"and don't know if they're friendly,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,866750,868810,it's best not to touch them.
QtX2_HYiIqI,868810,870100,"Hi, Teresa."
QtX2_HYiIqI,870100,873490,- She eats leaves and just hangs out in the trees.
QtX2_HYiIqI,873490,875450,"- Very nice, where does she live in the wild?"
QtX2_HYiIqI,875450,877290,"- In the wild, she is from Papua New Guinea"
QtX2_HYiIqI,877290,879300,and the Solomon Islands.
QtX2_HYiIqI,879300,880383,- Very cool.
QtX2_HYiIqI,882173,884519,"Jen, what kind of bug is this?"
QtX2_HYiIqI,884520,885353,- This is Stacy.
QtX2_HYiIqI,885353,888590,She's a spiny stick insect from Australia.
QtX2_HYiIqI,888590,891010,- A spiny stick insect.
QtX2_HYiIqI,891010,895260,She does have these spines all along her back all over.
QtX2_HYiIqI,895260,897930,She looks like a stick that you would see on a tree.
QtX2_HYiIqI,897930,900270,"- [Jen] She eats leaves from the trees, too."
QtX2_HYiIqI,900270,901150,- [Caitie] So why would a bug
QtX2_HYiIqI,901150,903110,pretend to be a stick like that?
QtX2_HYiIqI,903110,905720,"- So predators, birds, spiders, and things"
QtX2_HYiIqI,905720,907189,don't want to eat them.
QtX2_HYiIqI,907190,909680,- So they totally blend in and no one can see them.
QtX2_HYiIqI,909680,912560,"- Exactly, they're really great at camouflaging."
QtX2_HYiIqI,912560,914060,- Stacy is good at pretending.
QtX2_HYiIqI,915670,918860,"Wow, look at these bugs."
QtX2_HYiIqI,918860,920529,- This is Chuck and Nora.
QtX2_HYiIqI,920530,923800,And they are Madagascar hissing cockroaches.
QtX2_HYiIqI,923800,925750,- [Caitie] A hissing cockroach?
QtX2_HYiIqI,925750,928340,- [Jen] They make a hissing noise when they get scared.
QtX2_HYiIqI,928340,930420,"- [Caitie] Wow, and they're from Madagascar?"
QtX2_HYiIqI,930420,931610,- [Jen] They are from Madagascar.
QtX2_HYiIqI,931610,933459,"And they eat fruits and vegetables,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,933460,935840,so they're really good at recycling things out in nature.
QtX2_HYiIqI,935840,936673,- [Caitie] Yeah.
QtX2_HYiIqI,936673,938120,- And the things that keep us healthy
QtX2_HYiIqI,938120,939279,also keep them healthy.
QtX2_HYiIqI,939280,940890,"- Yeah, we like fruits and vegetables."
QtX2_HYiIqI,940890,942194,- Yeah. - For sure.
QtX2_HYiIqI,942194,943027,Can I try holding one?
QtX2_HYiIqI,943027,943860,- Definitely.
QtX2_HYiIqI,943860,944852,- Don't hiss.
QtX2_HYiIqI,945840,947640,"- That's Chuck. - Hi, Chuck."
QtX2_HYiIqI,947640,949660,- He's got little bumps on the top of his head.
QtX2_HYiIqI,949660,951310,It tells us he's one of the boys.
QtX2_HYiIqI,952890,953880,- Wow.
QtX2_HYiIqI,953880,955410,"- You can see they've got six legs too,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,955410,956959,'cause they are an insect.
QtX2_HYiIqI,956960,958870,- All insects have six legs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,958870,959708,- Exactly.
QtX2_HYiIqI,959708,960541,(upbeat music)
QtX2_HYiIqI,960541,962294,- I like his little antennas.
QtX2_HYiIqI,962294,964150,- [Jen] He's smelling and feeling around.
QtX2_HYiIqI,964150,965840,- Who's this person.
QtX2_HYiIqI,965840,967040,"I'm your friend, Caitie."
QtX2_HYiIqI,969880,973970,"Whoa, check out this guy, who's this?"
QtX2_HYiIqI,973970,976889,"- This is Millie, our giant Asian millipede."
QtX2_HYiIqI,976890,979250,- A giant Asian millipede.
QtX2_HYiIqI,979250,980720,Look how many legs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,980720,982886,Does that mean that she has a million legs
QtX2_HYiIqI,982887,983720,because she's a millipede?
QtX2_HYiIqI,983720,985839,- [Jen] She can have about 300 or 400 legs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,985840,987920,- [Caitie] That's still a lot of legs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,987920,989950,300 or 400 legs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,989950,991390,- Her little toes help to hold on
QtX2_HYiIqI,991390,993230,like little bristles on the toothbrush.
QtX2_HYiIqI,993230,994751,- And they tickle.
QtX2_HYiIqI,994751,998069,I wonder how big can an Asian millipede get?
QtX2_HYiIqI,998070,1000470,- [Jen] This is about as big as Millie gets.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1000470,1001420,- She's pretty big.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1002370,1005453,"I like her, it tickles."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1006640,1008953,- [Jen] Millie really likes to dig in the dirt.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1011651,1013251,And she eats fruits and veggies.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1015380,1017483,- Lots of fruits and veggies for insects.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1018520,1019353,It tickles.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1022460,1024207,Look at all those legs moving.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1027750,1030949,"Wow, Jen, thank you so much for sharing"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1030949,1032949,all these really neat bugs with us.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1032949,1033782,"- Oh, you're most welcome."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1033782,1034839,Glad you could come and visit them.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1034839,1036263,- It was lots of fun.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1036264,1037097,- Bye.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1039829,1043760,- In here lives a tarantula named Rosie.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1043760,1046113,A tarantula is a kind of spider.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1047069,1049350,It says she's been living here for nine years
QtX2_HYiIqI,1049350,1053343,and some tarantulas can live to be 30 years old.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1053343,1055223,Let's see if we can find her.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1056660,1058073,Where are you Rosie?
QtX2_HYiIqI,1060270,1061950,There she is.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1061950,1065393,She's hanging out in the back behind a rock hiding.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1066390,1067383,"Hi, Rosie."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1069260,1073233,"In here, there's Asian bush katydids."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1074779,1077103,They look like really big crickets.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1078510,1080480,You can see their six legs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1080480,1082960,So that means they're an insect.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1082960,1085620,"And you can see the things that they eat,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1085620,1089647,"fruits and vegetables, just like Jen said."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1089647,1093273,"You have some sweet potato, some zucchini, and apple."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1095330,1099579,"Look, this is a jade headed beetle"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1099579,1102632,because of the color green on its head.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1103850,1107460,"And it's eating, yum yum."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1107460,1110850,Look at all these different kinds of beetles.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1110850,1115809,Some are really small and some are really big.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1115810,1118320,There's so many different kinds of beetles
QtX2_HYiIqI,1118320,1121350,and a new kind of beetle is being discovered every day.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1121350,1122813,Isn't that amazing?
QtX2_HYiIqI,1123970,1127210,These are called rhinoceros beetles.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1127210,1128403,Can you guess why?
QtX2_HYiIqI,1130780,1132373,Check out their horns.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1134750,1136973,So many cool bugs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1139190,1142832,"Wow, there are so many kinds of interesting bugs."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1144850,1147100,It was so neat to see them up close
QtX2_HYiIqI,1147100,1149723,at the Cambridge Butterfly Conservatory.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1153440,1157019,Those bugs are really interesting.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1157020,1158553,I wasn't too scared.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1159450,1162889,Some people do feel scared around bugs.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1162890,1165193,Do you know the story of Little Miss Muffet?
QtX2_HYiIqI,1166090,1169263,"She came across a spider and then,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1170340,1172669,"well, why don't we look at the story together"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1172670,1173670,with the kamishibai?
QtX2_HYiIqI,1175943,1177603,This is a kamishibai.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1178510,1182148,It's a special form of storytelling from Japan.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1182148,1183326,(upbeat music)
QtX2_HYiIqI,1183327,1187187,And today's story is Little Miss Muffet.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1189430,1192560,"Little Miss Muffet, sat on a tuffet,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1192560,1194743,eating some curds and whey.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1196010,1198213,"Curds and whey, yum, yum."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1200020,1204627,Along came a spider who sat down beside her.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1204627,1206867,"""Hello, mind if I sit here?"""
QtX2_HYiIqI,1209490,1213970,"And frightened, Miss Muffet away."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1213970,1214882,Where'd she go?
QtX2_HYiIqI,1218360,1222390,Little Mr. Spider who sat down beside her
QtX2_HYiIqI,1222390,1225870,was now eating the curds and whey.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1225870,1229800,"Along came his mother, his father and brother"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1229800,1233077,"who said, ""Share with us, okay?"""
QtX2_HYiIqI,1235330,1237882,"Yum, yum, yummy."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1238750,1240690,"When they had their fill,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1240690,1245173,they hopped to the sill and spun together a web.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1247525,1252525,"It said, we hate to be rude, so thanks for the food."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1254240,1256543,"And with that, they went away."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1261290,1265330,"When Little Miss Muffet went back to her tuffet,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1265330,1267813,she saw what the spiders did spin.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1268660,1270110,"Oh, look at that."
QtX2_HYiIqI,1271370,1273059,And from that moment there
QtX2_HYiIqI,1273060,1277713,she would never be scared of the spiders ever again.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1278630,1279823,The end.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1281080,1282740,Little Miss Muffet wasn't so scared
QtX2_HYiIqI,1282740,1284382,of the spiders after all.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1286070,1288139,"I really do like bugs,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1288140,1292209,and I like playing and exploring with all of you.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1292209,1293960,I had a lot of fun today.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1293960,1297309,"It's time now to sing a big goodbye to all our friends,"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1297310,1298710,but I'll see you again soon.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1299980,1301372,Let's wave and sing.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1302621,1306537,"♪ Bye bye, good bye ♪"
QtX2_HYiIqI,1306537,1310150,♪ Thanks for playing with me ♪
QtX2_HYiIqI,1310150,1311905,See you soon.
QtX2_HYiIqI,1311905,1315322,(energetic upbeat music)
