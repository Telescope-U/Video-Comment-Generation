GT9k0i8CMMk,880,2399,the numbers have been climbing month by
GT9k0i8CMMk,2399,4560,month now the trickle has turned into a
GT9k0i8CMMk,4560,8160,flood of economic hardship
GT9k0i8CMMk,8720,10639,and today inflation is the highest it's
GT9k0i8CMMk,10639,14799,been in four decades
GT9k0i8CMMk,14799,16480,rising food costs have been a major
GT9k0i8CMMk,16480,18880,driver just listen to what's happened to
GT9k0i8CMMk,18880,22480,a bag of flour on average wheat is 160
GT9k0i8CMMk,22480,24560,it was already at about 210 before
GT9k0i8CMMk,24560,27599,christmas invasion of ukraine it's gone
GT9k0i8CMMk,27599,30400,from 220 to 320. so that's been the
GT9k0i8CMMk,30400,33680,biggest impact for us but on top of that
GT9k0i8CMMk,33680,35360,you can see us behind flower bags all
GT9k0i8CMMk,35360,37760,made of paper 50 increase
GT9k0i8CMMk,37760,40800,we've had fuel 35 increase
GT9k0i8CMMk,40800,41440,and
GT9k0i8CMMk,41440,44399,all of that is having to be passed on to
GT9k0i8CMMk,44399,47360,the end customer baker in this case
GT9k0i8CMMk,47360,48640,the end customer though isn't just
GT9k0i8CMMk,48640,50480,having to pay more for flour but
GT9k0i8CMMk,50480,52960,everything else they buy too
GT9k0i8CMMk,52960,55840,inflation is now its highest since 1982
GT9k0i8CMMk,55840,58399,hitting 9.1 percent and driving that
GT9k0i8CMMk,58399,62239,rise the essentials food went up by 8.7
GT9k0i8CMMk,62239,64720,over the year to may road fuel prices
GT9k0i8CMMk,64720,66799,are 32.8
GT9k0i8CMMk,66799,69760,higher than just 12 months ago
GT9k0i8CMMk,69760,71600,high costs which economists say haven't
GT9k0i8CMMk,71600,74240,even peaked yet and pain which isn't
GT9k0i8CMMk,74240,76560,been spread evenly the bank of england
GT9k0i8CMMk,76560,79600,expects that inflation will exceed 11
GT9k0i8CMMk,79600,82000,in october but the poorest households
GT9k0i8CMMk,82000,83920,are already experiencing double-digit
GT9k0i8CMMk,83920,85680,inflation according to the resolution
GT9k0i8CMMk,85680,87520,foundation they spend more of their
GT9k0i8CMMk,87520,89840,incomes on the essentials so an increase
GT9k0i8CMMk,89840,92240,in food and fuel will have a much bigger
GT9k0i8CMMk,92240,94400,impact so the wealthiest households
GT9k0i8CMMk,94400,96400,right now are experiencing inflation of
GT9k0i8CMMk,96400,99040,just over eight and a half percent the
GT9k0i8CMMk,99040,101759,poorest are experiencing inflation of
GT9k0i8CMMk,101759,104880,just under 10 and a half percent
GT9k0i8CMMk,104880,106640,and that's now in shorts and sandals
GT9k0i8CMMk,106640,108720,weather let alone before energy prices
GT9k0i8CMMk,108720,111520,go up yet again in october very
GT9k0i8CMMk,111520,112840,concerned about this
GT9k0i8CMMk,112840,115439,winter because i know that the uh all
GT9k0i8CMMk,115439,117040,the electricity bills are going to go up
GT9k0i8CMMk,117040,118560,even more and people are not going to be
GT9k0i8CMMk,118560,121119,able to cope we used to have treats for
GT9k0i8CMMk,121119,123920,we cut them out we cut biscuits out
GT9k0i8CMMk,123920,126399,you name it we tried to cut it all out
GT9k0i8CMMk,126399,128479,for them though there is help on the way
GT9k0i8CMMk,128479,130560,pensions will rise by almost 10 percent
GT9k0i8CMMk,130560,133360,next april tomorrow more rail workers
GT9k0i8CMMk,133360,135360,will strike again over demands for wage
GT9k0i8CMMk,135360,137760,rises to fight the cost of living crisis
GT9k0i8CMMk,137760,139599,which the chancellor said isn't possible
GT9k0i8CMMk,139599,142480,today while defending pension hikes
GT9k0i8CMMk,142480,144239,well it's right that we reward our
GT9k0i8CMMk,144239,146560,hard-working public sector workers with
GT9k0i8CMMk,146560,148640,a pay rise but that needs to be
GT9k0i8CMMk,148640,151280,proportionate and balanced with the need
GT9k0i8CMMk,151280,152959,not to make the inflationary pressures
GT9k0i8CMMk,152959,155599,worse and also to see what's affordable
GT9k0i8CMMk,155599,157920,for the taxpayer now the slight
GT9k0i8CMMk,157920,159519,difference with pensions is pensions are
GT9k0i8CMMk,159519,161920,not an input cost into the cost of
GT9k0i8CMMk,161920,163680,producing goods and services we all
GT9k0i8CMMk,163680,165680,consume so they don't add to inflation
GT9k0i8CMMk,165680,167840,in the same way public sector workers
GT9k0i8CMMk,167840,169680,like teachers say a wage increase for
GT9k0i8CMMk,169680,172160,them won't drive up prices and today the
GT9k0i8CMMk,172160,175280,national education union demanded a 12
GT9k0i8CMMk,175280,177280,increase if you're in that middle income
GT9k0i8CMMk,177280,179599,bracket are you feeling significantly
GT9k0i8CMMk,179599,181840,worse off now than you were a year ago
GT9k0i8CMMk,181840,184239,well the the key thing here is that real
GT9k0i8CMMk,184239,186480,wages so adjusted for the effects of
GT9k0i8CMMk,186480,189680,inflation they are falling overall we're
GT9k0i8CMMk,189680,191680,worse off the key thing is that the
GT9k0i8CMMk,191680,195440,chancellor can decide who is made
GT9k0i8CMMk,195440,197120,less worse off
GT9k0i8CMMk,197120,198959,the chancellor's cost of living package
GT9k0i8CMMk,198959,201280,so far has reached 15 billion pounds
GT9k0i8CMMk,201280,204159,directed at the households most in need
GT9k0i8CMMk,204159,205519,but while the treasury deals with the
GT9k0i8CMMk,205519,208159,politics of pay and pensions the nation
GT9k0i8CMMk,208159,211360,struggles with prices and economic pain
GT9k0i8CMMk,211360,213519,well economics reporter neil mcdonald is
GT9k0i8CMMk,213519,216400,with me now neil any sign that this bad
GT9k0i8CMMk,216400,218480,news might go away sometime soon i'm
GT9k0i8CMMk,218480,219920,afraid no
GT9k0i8CMMk,219920,222319,so the 9.1 figure we're all talking
GT9k0i8CMMk,222319,225440,about is uh inflation for consumers we
GT9k0i8CMMk,225440,227599,also got figures today for inflation for
GT9k0i8CMMk,227599,229599,companies if you like like the miller
GT9k0i8CMMk,229599,232080,that we saw in paul's piece and those
GT9k0i8CMMk,232080,235120,figures are equally uh startling the
GT9k0i8CMMk,235120,237360,price of goods when they're leaving the
GT9k0i8CMMk,237360,239280,factory gate they're rising at the
GT9k0i8CMMk,239280,242080,fastest rate for 45 years the price of
GT9k0i8CMMk,242080,243920,the raw materials going into those
GT9k0i8CMMk,243920,246159,factories is rising at the fastest rate
GT9k0i8CMMk,246159,248480,on record it seems inevitable that most
GT9k0i8CMMk,248480,250000,of that is going to get passed on to us
GT9k0i8CMMk,250000,251920,at some point soon there's always a bit
GT9k0i8CMMk,251920,254080,of a row about pensions being protected
GT9k0i8CMMk,254080,256479,against inflation but especially so now
GT9k0i8CMMk,256479,258799,isn't that explain the controversy
GT9k0i8CMMk,258799,260959,that's arisen here is about what's
GT9k0i8CMMk,260959,262800,called the triple lock
GT9k0i8CMMk,262800,264160,which is a policy the government's
GT9k0i8CMMk,264160,267199,committed to and what this does is it
GT9k0i8CMMk,267199,268800,says that the basic state pension should
GT9k0i8CMMk,268800,270960,go up in line with inflation earnings or
GT9k0i8CMMk,270960,274400,2.5 percent whichever one is the highest
GT9k0i8CMMk,274400,276240,and of course right now there's no
GT9k0i8CMMk,276240,277520,prizes for guessing which one is the
GT9k0i8CMMk,277520,279680,highest it's inflation what that means
GT9k0i8CMMk,279680,282240,is almost certainly next april basic
GT9k0i8CMMk,282240,284160,state pension will go up by about 10
GT9k0i8CMMk,284160,286880,percent that protects
GT9k0i8CMMk,286880,288560,pensioners from inflation that's a
GT9k0i8CMMk,288560,290880,guarantee that very few workers have got
GT9k0i8CMMk,290880,292880,and what's the justification for it well
GT9k0i8CMMk,292880,295759,if you go back uh 25 years pensioners
GT9k0i8CMMk,295759,298320,were more likely to be in poverty than
GT9k0i8CMMk,298320,301280,working households but that is starting
GT9k0i8CMMk,301280,303680,to change if you look here what these
GT9k0i8CMMk,303680,306639,two lines show you are household incomes
GT9k0i8CMMk,306639,308560,for those working age with children and
GT9k0i8CMMk,308560,311199,pensioners 25 years ago pensioners
GT9k0i8CMMk,311199,314960,trailing by about 3 800 pounds that gap
GT9k0i8CMMk,314960,317919,has shrunk dramatically yeah now that's
GT9k0i8CMMk,317919,320240,good news and of course there are still
GT9k0i8CMMk,320240,323280,some pensioners who are in poverty but
GT9k0i8CMMk,323280,326000,this does raise questions about how we
GT9k0i8CMMk,326000,328000,should protect pensioners as a group
GT9k0i8CMMk,328000,330080,going forward neil macdonald thanks very
GT9k0i8CMMk,330080,333240,much indeed
