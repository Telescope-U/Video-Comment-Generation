TNl8pcd-eSI,13246,16148,">> WELL, JOSE, YEAH, WE'RE "
TNl8pcd-eSI,16148,17216,WAITING FOR SUPREME COURT 
TNl8pcd-eSI,17216,18284,DECISIONS TODAY.
TNl8pcd-eSI,18284,20019,WE'VE GOT ONE MORE YET TO COME.
TNl8pcd-eSI,20019,21654,BUT THE SUPREME COURT HAS JUST 
TNl8pcd-eSI,21654,23055,GIVEN A VERY INTERESTING RULING 
TNl8pcd-eSI,23055,25124,ON A CASE INVOLVING FREEDOM OF 
TNl8pcd-eSI,25124,25558,RELIGION.
TNl8pcd-eSI,25558,27660,THIS WAS A CASE FROM MAINE.
TNl8pcd-eSI,27660,28828,HAS AN UNUSUAL PROGRAM.
TNl8pcd-eSI,28828,30696,IN ORDER TO LET CHILDREN WHO 
TNl8pcd-eSI,30696,32999,LIVE IN RURAL AREAS ATTEND HIGH 
TNl8pcd-eSI,32999,33332,SCHOOL.
TNl8pcd-eSI,33332,34800,THEY GIVE MONEY TO PARENTS WHO 
TNl8pcd-eSI,34800,37103,THEN CAN USE THAT FOR TUITION TO
TNl8pcd-eSI,37103,38738,SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO EITHER 
TNl8pcd-eSI,38738,40072,PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS.
TNl8pcd-eSI,40072,43509,BUT THE STATE HAS A LAW THAT 
TNl8pcd-eSI,43509,45812,SAYS THAT MONEY CAN'T BE USED TO
TNl8pcd-eSI,45812,47647,SEND THE CHILDREN TO WHAT ARE 
TNl8pcd-eSI,47647,49081,CALLED SECTARIAN SCHOOLS.
TNl8pcd-eSI,49081,50550,THE SUPREME COURT HAS PREVIOUSLY
TNl8pcd-eSI,50550,52452,RULED THAT WHEN STATES HAVE SORT
TNl8pcd-eSI,52452,54420,OF A SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM LIKE 
TNl8pcd-eSI,54420,56055,"THIS, THEY CAN'T DISCRIMINATE "
TNl8pcd-eSI,56055,58124,AGAINST SCHOOLS THAT HAVE 
TNl8pcd-eSI,58124,59759,"RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION, THAT ARE "
TNl8pcd-eSI,59759,61694,JUST RUN BY A RELIGIOUS GROUP.
TNl8pcd-eSI,61694,63329,THIS RULING TAKES IT A STEP 
TNl8pcd-eSI,63329,64629,FURTHER AND SAYS IF THE STATES 
TNl8pcd-eSI,64629,66833,ARE GOING TO GIVE MONEY FOR THIS
TNl8pcd-eSI,66833,69035,"KIND OF SUPPORT, IT ALSO HAS TO "
TNl8pcd-eSI,69035,71504,GIVE TO PARENTS WHO CAN SEND 
TNl8pcd-eSI,71504,72972,THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS THAT 
TNl8pcd-eSI,72972,75041,OFFER A RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.

TNl8pcd-eSI,77076,79779,BUT EXPLICITLY OFFER A RELIGIOUS
TNl8pcd-eSI,79779,80146,EDUCATION.
TNl8pcd-eSI,80146,82181,THE PREMIUM COURT SAID IT WOULD 
TNl8pcd-eSI,82181,83816,VIOLATE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM NOT TO
TNl8pcd-eSI,83816,85718,ALLOW PARENTS USE THE MONEY TO 
TNl8pcd-eSI,85718,87219,SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO 
TNl8pcd-eSI,87219,89756,RELIGIOUSLY ORIENTED SCHOOLS.
TNl8pcd-eSI,89756,92358,AND IT ALSO SAYS TO AN EXTENT A 
TNl8pcd-eSI,92358,93860,CIRCUIT BREAKER HERE BECAUSE THE
TNl8pcd-eSI,93860,95428,MONEY DOESN'T GO DIRECTLY TO THE
TNl8pcd-eSI,95428,97063,"SCHOOLS, IT GOES TO THE PARENTS "
TNl8pcd-eSI,97063,98297,WHO THEN DECIDE WHERE TO SEND 
TNl8pcd-eSI,98297,99265,THEIR CHILDREN.
TNl8pcd-eSI,99265,101033,SO IT'S ANOTHER STEP IN YOU 
TNl8pcd-eSI,101033,104470,MIGHT SAY LOWERING THE WALL OF 
TNl8pcd-eSI,104470,105638,CELEBRATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND 
TNl8pcd-eSI,105638,105938,STATE.
TNl8pcd-eSI,105938,107940,THE COURT SAYING IF THE STATE'S 
TNl8pcd-eSI,107940,109508,GOING TO HAVE THIS KIND OF

TNl8pcd-eSI,111043,113046,ALLOW THE MONEY TO GO TO SCHOOLS
TNl8pcd-eSI,113046,114980,"THAT OFFER RELIGIOUS EDUCATION, "
TNl8pcd-eSI,114980,116649,SO THAT STATE SUPPORT FOR A 
TNl8pcd-eSI,116649,117517,RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.
TNl8pcd-eSI,117517,120820,AND IT'S A 6-3 DECISION WITH THE
