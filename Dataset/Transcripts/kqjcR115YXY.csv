kqjcR115YXY,55680,64000,whoa  check it out this plane is so big it's  called the short sutherland mr5
kqjcR115YXY,64000,69439,wow  and check it out it has massive  propellers
kqjcR115YXY,69439,75280,yeah two on each wing two on one wing  and two on the other wing
kqjcR115YXY,75280,81680,two and two means four propellers what  not so many

kqjcR115YXY,102560,108320,hey do you notice anything interesting  about this plane
kqjcR115YXY,111520,117600,yeah it's the bottom of the plane  it looks kind of like a boot
kqjcR115YXY,117600,125200,and you notice the windows  [Music]  yeah the windows are circles and maybe
kqjcR115YXY,125200,130319,you've seen those on a boat or a  submarine before yeah do you know why
kqjcR115YXY,130319,135440,that is  that's because this is a seaplane yeah
kqjcR115YXY,135440,141520,and there are two kinds of seaplanes  there are  below planes
kqjcR115YXY,141520,148560,and  flying boats yeah  a float plane is just a regular plane
kqjcR115YXY,148560,155840,with floaties on the bottom  but a flying boat is a boat on the  bottom
kqjcR115YXY,155840,164319,wow  whoa  it's made of metal it's so
kqjcR115YXY,164319,167319,musical
kqjcR115YXY,170720,176319,that is awesome it's really important  that the short southerland mr5 is a
kqjcR115YXY,176319,182720,flying boat because it was built a long  time ago yeah and it would fly really
kqjcR115YXY,182720,188319,far distances across the atlantic ocean
kqjcR115YXY,188319,193440,yeah and there weren't a lot of places  for it to land on the land so it could
kqjcR115YXY,193440,198560,just land in the water  this is so awesome hey let's go take a
kqjcR115YXY,198560,211879,look inside come on  [Music]

kqjcR115YXY,318880,325120,yellow yeah and it's really important  that it's a bright color like yellow so
kqjcR115YXY,325120,330560,if you need rescuing you can see it  hello  whoa
kqjcR115YXY,330560,335919,and check it out  [Music]  this looks familiar it looks like the
kqjcR115YXY,335919,341600,same kinds of floaties on a seaplane  this is in case it needs to land it can
kqjcR115YXY,341600,348160,float in the water  wow  you see up there look
kqjcR115YXY,348160,353840,it's a really big propeller  whoa
kqjcR115YXY,354080,361440,yeah  a propeller on a rescue helicopter is so  strong and so fast so it can go through
kqjcR115YXY,361440,366639,any kinds of weather if it's really  windy  [Music]
kqjcR115YXY,366639,372639,or really rainy  it'll be able to make it through the

kqjcR115YXY,390960,396639,bye  so silly  whoa  no way
kqjcR115YXY,396639,402720,it's the cockpit of the helicopter yeah  and you see there's a window that
kqjcR115YXY,402720,409680,window's really important because the  pilot can look out and make sure the  rescue is going great
kqjcR115YXY,409680,422080,whoa and look over here come on  [Music]
kqjcR115YXY,422080,430560,look at it the most important part of a  helicopter rescue mission  yeah this is the winch
kqjcR115YXY,430560,437360,whoa  yeah the winch is what someone would  clip onto yeah so they could drop down
kqjcR115YXY,437360,443280,from the helicopter and save someone  yeah they just grab on tight and whoa
kqjcR115YXY,443280,449599,up they go back into the helicopter  whoa  once they were inside there would be a
kqjcR115YXY,449599,455919,doctor and maybe a snack so they would  be nice and safe  wow
kqjcR115YXY,455919,462560,look at it there's beds and lots of  seats and floaty devices
kqjcR115YXY,462560,467039,whoa  helicopters are awesome
kqjcR115YXY,471620,477280,[Music]  look at where we are we're inside of a
kqjcR115YXY,477280,483360,hangar yeah a hangar is a place where  they store all kinds of jets and  airplanes
kqjcR115YXY,483360,490280,whoa and look at this jet let's go look  at the cockpit come on
kqjcR115YXY,492479,502120,oh  check it out  this is awesome  this jet is called the tornado
kqjcR115YXY,502160,508479,whoa  and it goes really fast  yeah  look at it this right here is the
kqjcR115YXY,508479,514800,cockpit that's the place where the pilot  sits to steer the plane
kqjcR115YXY,515760,522719,whoa  look at it there's another seat right  behind the pilot yeah  that's where the navigator sits and he
kqjcR115YXY,522719,531760,makes sure that you're going in the  right direction  whoa  it's so big and so cool
kqjcR115YXY,531760,537839,hey  and look here has really big wings  whoa
kqjcR115YXY,537839,542880,huh  and it looks like the wings can open up
kqjcR115YXY,542880,548000,yeah they open up so the plane can do  different things when they're really
kqjcR115YXY,548000,554080,open really wide it helps the plane be  nice and stable to land but if this jet
kqjcR115YXY,554080,560399,wants to go really really fast they  close up whoo to zoom away
kqjcR115YXY,560399,565760,yeah and that's really helpful because  the tornado likes to fly low yeah
kqjcR115YXY,565760,570959,really low sometimes as low as a tree  whoa
kqjcR115YXY,570959,585459,well we better go see some more jets  come on  [Music]
kqjcR115YXY,587920,594959,there are so many planes and jets here  in the hangar yeah oh and look at the  back of the tornado
kqjcR115YXY,594959,602320,whoa  this is where the jet engines are yeah  look this one doesn't have an engine in
kqjcR115YXY,602320,608720,it right now oh look this one does  hello
kqjcR115YXY,608720,614639,so shiny yeah these jets can go so fast
kqjcR115YXY,616399,624079,let's go see if we can find some more  i think  this is another jet yeah
kqjcR115YXY,624079,630240,this jet right here is called  a buccaneer yeah a buccaneer do you know
kqjcR115YXY,630240,635440,why it's called that i wonder why well i  bet it's called that because these
kqjcR115YXY,635440,640480,planes take off from aircraft carriers  yeah
kqjcR115YXY,640480,646720,do you know what an aircraft carrier is  yeah they're really big boats that store
kqjcR115YXY,646720,652880,lots of planes and you see this wing  yeah look the wing
kqjcR115YXY,652880,661120,they fold  yeah they fold just like your arm can  fold or a piece of paper yeah they fold
kqjcR115YXY,661120,667600,so you can fit lots of plane tight  together on an aircraft carrier  yeah and
kqjcR115YXY,667600,674320,look it has really big wheels and tires  kinda like a car but that helps the
kqjcR115YXY,674320,680240,plane land nice and safe and roll  smoothly down the runway
kqjcR115YXY,680240,684720,whoa  it's so big
kqjcR115YXY,685519,693360,i think i see another plane come on  check it out
kqjcR115YXY,693440,699760,wow  this plane is awesome  yeah
kqjcR115YXY,699760,705600,wow  do you see the plane hanging above me
kqjcR115YXY,705600,711279,yeah it's called a harrier yeah  a harrier
kqjcR115YXY,711279,716959,whoa it's also called a jump plane  a jump plane
kqjcR115YXY,716959,724240,i like to jump will you jump with me  okay let's jump like a jump plane
kqjcR115YXY,728880,735920,that was really fun jumping together do  you know why it's called a jump plane  yeah that's because it has really
kqjcR115YXY,735920,741200,powerful engines that can change  direction yeah instead of going out of
kqjcR115YXY,741200,748399,the back of the airplane they can go  under the airplane and it can take off
kqjcR115YXY,748399,753839,straight up like a helicopter whoa  that's pretty cool
kqjcR115YXY,753839,759250,hey  i think i see one last plane that we  should look at come on
kqjcR115YXY,759250,765500,[Music]  do you see it  do you see another plane

kqjcR115YXY,790800,797920,yeah and this one has a really big nose  look it's the color black
kqjcR115YXY,797920,804240,hercules planes are so cool because  they're so big they're so big that they

kqjcR115YXY,811040,816639,that's really big this plane can carry  cars and trucks
kqjcR115YXY,816639,824399,what  wow these jets are so cool we should  keep exploring come on

kqjcR115YXY,1795360,1800960,let's see can you guess which vehicle  this is let's go find out
kqjcR115YXY,1800960,1808399,hey  it's me blippi wow and look at where i'm  at yeah today i'm at tenino washington
kqjcR115YXY,1808399,1814240,at a job site yeah and today you and i  get to learn about a machine yeah really
kqjcR115YXY,1814240,1819840,heavy machine has a really big blade up  front pushes anything and everything out
kqjcR115YXY,1819840,1825039,of its way has a lot of power  it's a little slow though and it starts
kqjcR115YXY,1825039,1831279,with the letter b just like my name  do you know what machine it is
kqjcR115YXY,1831279,1835880,okay let's go find out

kqjcR115YXY,1847919,1853360,check it out wow  a piece of construction equipment and
kqjcR115YXY,1853360,1859679,this is a powerful piece of construction  equipment do you know what machine this  is
kqjcR115YXY,1859919,1867279,yeah  this is a bulldozer whoa it is so  powerful here come on
kqjcR115YXY,1867279,1875120,whoa  this is the blade of the bulldozer yeah  the blade pushes anything and everything
kqjcR115YXY,1875120,1882559,out of its way and then it goes flat on  the ground  and then makes the ground nice and flat
kqjcR115YXY,1882559,1888159,whoa  now it gets all of its power  is right here
kqjcR115YXY,1888159,1894480,yeah the engine and this is the engine  compartment yeah it produces a lot of
kqjcR115YXY,1894480,1900000,power and a lot of smoke out of the  exhaust
