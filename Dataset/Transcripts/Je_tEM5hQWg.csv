Je_tEM5hQWg,47600,49680,to a meat lover's dream a drive-in
Je_tEM5hQWg,49680,52239,barbecue on an absolutely massive scale

Je_tEM5hQWg,70320,72400,with his butchery and bottle store now
Je_tEM5hQWg,72400,75040,it looks like this
Je_tEM5hQWg,75040,77119,one of the capital's major food hubs
Je_tEM5hQWg,77119,80400,with tons to choose from
Je_tEM5hQWg,80640,83840,come drink eat drink more and hopefully
Je_tEM5hQWg,83840,86159,take a cab home
Je_tEM5hQWg,86159,88159,yesterday ferrari local grazia

Je_tEM5hQWg,90159,92079,city and right now she's introducing me
Je_tEM5hQWg,92079,94479,to cheapo my name is sunny and this is
Je_tEM5hQWg,94479,95840,gracia
Je_tEM5hQWg,95840,98079,cheapo is the manager of big band bride
Je_tEM5hQWg,98079,100159,a meaty street stall influenced by south
Je_tEM5hQWg,100159,101680,african barbecue right now you're
Je_tEM5hQWg,101680,104240,preparing a dish this is called
Je_tEM5hQWg,104240,106479,gongo is a favorite in zimbabwe but this
Je_tEM5hQWg,106479,108320,is not a one-person plate of food we
Je_tEM5hQWg,108320,110399,usually save in a tray and everyone digs
Je_tEM5hQWg,110399,112399,in from the same plate it's a platter of
Je_tEM5hQWg,112399,114079,protein meant to be shared with friends
Je_tEM5hQWg,114079,115759,or family it's more like something that
Je_tEM5hQWg,115759,117920,brings us closer together communal food
Je_tEM5hQWg,117920,119600,reminds me of korean barbecue a little
Je_tEM5hQWg,119600,121600,bit the foundation of the recipe is an
Je_tEM5hQWg,121600,125360,incomprehensible mix of meat
Je_tEM5hQWg,125840,128000,ox kidney and beef are added to a wok
Je_tEM5hQWg,128000,130560,with water and salt
Je_tEM5hQWg,130560,132160,on the side chicken gizzards that are
Je_tEM5hQWg,132160,133920,cleaned chopped and added in is this
Je_tEM5hQWg,133920,135520,going to be a stew or what will this be
Je_tEM5hQWg,135520,137040,basically we don't want it to be as
Je_tEM5hQWg,137040,139040,chewy the main reason behind it is that
Je_tEM5hQWg,139040,141040,we get to fry all these and then add our
Je_tEM5hQWg,141040,143200,vegetables and then our chilies then
Je_tEM5hQWg,143200,146800,chicken neck feet and thigh
Je_tEM5hQWg,146800,148640,add more water and allow it to cook down
Je_tEM5hQWg,148640,150239,a bit it seems like a lot of street food
Je_tEM5hQWg,150239,152000,here is meat yeah mainly the meat
Je_tEM5hQWg,152000,154640,because this area it specializes in
Je_tEM5hQWg,154640,156879,gochugochi or brai which is just
Je_tEM5hQWg,156879,158879,basically barbecue and meat our parade
Je_tEM5hQWg,158879,161200,of protein continues heart pork belly
Je_tEM5hQWg,161200,163599,spicy pork sausage then a bit of cooking
Je_tEM5hQWg,163599,167599,oil and diced onions and tomatoes
Je_tEM5hQWg,167680,170319,finally the green well cheapo can tell
Je_tEM5hQWg,170319,172319,you what it's called you call them rape
Je_tEM5hQWg,172319,173780,are you saying the word rape
Je_tEM5hQWg,173780,174959,[Music]
Je_tEM5hQWg,174959,177120,how do you say it um
Je_tEM5hQWg,177120,179720,it's a rape city that's how they call it
Je_tEM5hQWg,179720,181440,r-a-p-e
Je_tEM5hQWg,181440,182959,yeah there's no way around that hit with
Je_tEM5hQWg,182959,184879,a bit of spice and dig in with six of
Je_tEM5hQWg,184879,186310,your closest friends
Je_tEM5hQWg,186310,187599,[Music]
Je_tEM5hQWg,187599,189200,all right we have our meal right here
Je_tEM5hQWg,189200,190720,this looks even better than i thought it
Je_tEM5hQWg,190720,191760,would oh we're eating with our hands
Je_tEM5hQWg,191760,193200,aren't we yeah definitely no one brought
Je_tEM5hQWg,193200,195280,forks it's forks in here right these are
Je_tEM5hQWg,195280,196720,the forks i think we should start with
Je_tEM5hQWg,196720,199280,pork belly just covered with rape all
Je_tEM5hQWg,199280,201760,right let's try it out
Je_tEM5hQWg,202560,204560,the r word is definitely like a spinach
Je_tEM5hQWg,204560,205920,or something where there's still some
Je_tEM5hQWg,205920,207120,texture to it while you're eating it
Je_tEM5hQWg,207120,208959,it's not just dissolved away i see there
Je_tEM5hQWg,208959,210319,are hearts
Je_tEM5hQWg,210319,211920,it tastes really good it almost tastes
Je_tEM5hQWg,211920,214080,buttery salty and then some nice spice
Je_tEM5hQWg,214080,215360,coming from the chilies i think this is
Je_tEM5hQWg,215360,218080,the ox kidney over here
Je_tEM5hQWg,218080,220480,mm-hmm this tastes like liver they both
Je_tEM5hQWg,220480,222319,have that minerality right because it's
Je_tEM5hQWg,222319,224159,filtering uh you know all your stuff and
Je_tEM5hQWg,224159,225840,turning it into pea are you saying pee
Je_tEM5hQWg,225840,230159,when i'm eating it city oh um not pin
Je_tEM5hQWg,230159,231760,sausage
Je_tEM5hQWg,231760,233360,well seasoned it's got a kick of
Je_tEM5hQWg,233360,235040,spiciness in it as well i think i've got
Je_tEM5hQWg,235040,237360,a gheeze in here
Je_tEM5hQWg,237360,239599,oh super chewy delicious i love that
Je_tEM5hQWg,239599,241280,it's such a random hodgepodge of
Je_tEM5hQWg,241280,242720,different ingredients but when they cook
Je_tEM5hQWg,242720,244799,it all together it works perfectly okay
Je_tEM5hQWg,244799,246159,saad's up this just doesn't have a lot
Je_tEM5hQWg,246159,247599,of flavor so you have to kind of add
Je_tEM5hQWg,247599,249599,flavor to it by putting in the meat and
Je_tEM5hQWg,249599,251680,the veggies so you do that little spoon
Je_tEM5hQWg,251680,253840,thing again way ahead of you oh i see
Je_tEM5hQWg,253840,255760,you're learning singing
Je_tEM5hQWg,255760,258160,what is that are you smiggle
Je_tEM5hQWg,258160,260479,cheers
Je_tEM5hQWg,260880,262240,it tastes like chicken heart with a base
Je_tEM5hQWg,262240,263840,of mashed potatoes that have no salt or
Je_tEM5hQWg,263840,265680,butter inside now chicken feet everyone
Je_tEM5hQWg,265680,266960,around the world has a different way of
Je_tEM5hQWg,266960,269440,eating it let me see your way
Je_tEM5hQWg,269440,270880,okay you try to strip it away but
Je_tEM5hQWg,270880,272800,sometimes the toes will rip off okay no
Je_tEM5hQWg,272800,274400,they didn't oh you know what's gnarly
Je_tEM5hQWg,274400,276320,about this this is my first time eating
Je_tEM5hQWg,276320,278240,chicken feet with the toenails they're
Je_tEM5hQWg,278240,281520,still on there let me try it
Je_tEM5hQWg,281520,283040,it hasn't been cooked that long so the
Je_tEM5hQWg,283040,285199,meat's still kind of hard
Je_tEM5hQWg,285199,286400,so you have to really work to get it off
Je_tEM5hQWg,286400,287919,but once you do it's nice and chewy like
Je_tEM5hQWg,287919,291680,some kind of calamari sunny
Je_tEM5hQWg,292479,294080,i wanted to ask you more about harare
Je_tEM5hQWg,294080,295759,did you grow up here yeah i did born and
Je_tEM5hQWg,295759,296960,raised in harare why do you think
Je_tEM5hQWg,296960,299199,zimbabwe isn't more known globally we
Je_tEM5hQWg,299199,300560,have a lot of beautiful places in
Je_tEM5hQWg,300560,302479,subarus apart from victoria falls that
Je_tEM5hQWg,302479,304560,everybody else knows we have inyanga
Je_tEM5hQWg,304560,306560,montopazi hills where you actually get
Je_tEM5hQWg,306560,308639,like scenic views that are so beautiful
Je_tEM5hQWg,308639,310720,but i feel like there hasn't been enough
Je_tEM5hQWg,310720,312800,of coverage on what our country has to
Je_tEM5hQWg,312800,314560,offer another problem that we might be
Je_tEM5hQWg,314560,316960,having is people of our generation we
Je_tEM5hQWg,316960,319039,don't speak a lot of positive about our
Je_tEM5hQWg,319039,321120,country if we learn to embrace our
Je_tEM5hQWg,321120,323199,culture more definitely people will end
Je_tEM5hQWg,323199,325120,up knowing about zimbabwe and falling in
Je_tEM5hQWg,325120,327039,love with it and people wanting to come
Je_tEM5hQWg,327039,328800,and see what zimbabwe has to offer i got
Je_tEM5hQWg,328800,330000,to say i've just been here for a day and
Je_tEM5hQWg,330000,332160,a half but i'm loving it so far great so
Je_tEM5hQWg,332160,333360,with that being said this is a great
Je_tEM5hQWg,333360,334720,start we have a lot more street food to
Je_tEM5hQWg,334720,338360,eat let's go
Je_tEM5hQWg,340240,342240,well ashley how you doing this is your
Je_tEM5hQWg,342240,343199,place
Je_tEM5hQWg,343199,345520,it's fantastic just 30 steps away tucked
Je_tEM5hQWg,345520,347520,inside a small alley miss ashley is
Je_tEM5hQWg,347520,350000,preparing another zimbabwean staple one
Je_tEM5hQWg,350000,351680,i've never seen before right here in the
Je_tEM5hQWg,351680,354080,first pot this is rice but it's not any
Je_tEM5hQWg,354080,356000,kind of rice it's a brown rice and it's
Je_tEM5hQWg,356000,357600,turned brown because it's been mixed
Je_tEM5hQWg,357600,359360,with peanut butter something i've never
Je_tEM5hQWg,359360,361360,had before but i love peanut butter next
Je_tEM5hQWg,361360,363360,the beef bones so these are big thick
Je_tEM5hQWg,363360,365680,chunks of cow femur the bones are boiled
Je_tEM5hQWg,365680,367759,in a big pot for at least two hours or
Je_tEM5hQWg,367759,369680,until people start asking for them toss
Je_tEM5hQWg,369680,371759,in some salt and tomatoes and boil it a
Je_tEM5hQWg,371759,374160,bit more is this rape yes it's also a
Je_tEM5hQWg,374160,376800,peanut butter yes oh that's great ashley
Je_tEM5hQWg,376800,379520,yes thank you so much
Je_tEM5hQWg,379520,381600,i'm dying to try this i love peanut
Je_tEM5hQWg,381600,383919,butter
Je_tEM5hQWg,384319,385919,i like it it's not a super strong peanut
Je_tEM5hQWg,385919,387840,taste it lacks the sweetness that our
Je_tEM5hQWg,387840,389600,peanut butter has because uh in the us
Je_tEM5hQWg,389600,391680,we like to put sugar in peanut butter no
Je_tEM5hQWg,391680,393199,everything it's interesting because the
Je_tEM5hQWg,393199,394800,rice has been cooked so much that it's
Je_tEM5hQWg,394800,396560,become kind of a mesh with just a hint
Je_tEM5hQWg,396560,398000,of peanut flavor on top of that and it
Je_tEM5hQWg,398000,399660,seems like it'd go well with these two
Je_tEM5hQWg,399660,402479,[Music]
Je_tEM5hQWg,402479,404000,i really like that vegetable so it's hot
Je_tEM5hQWg,404000,405680,steaming juicy and then i would say
Je_tEM5hQWg,405680,407680,between cabbage and spinach but now with
Je_tEM5hQWg,407680,409360,a hint of peanut flavor in there too is
Je_tEM5hQWg,409360,410800,that something local to this country
Je_tEM5hQWg,410800,412720,they're one of the dishes that you get
Je_tEM5hQWg,412720,414240,at traditional functions like
Je_tEM5hQWg,414240,416160,traditional weddings even if grandmother
Je_tEM5hQWg,416160,417360,comes from the village you're probably
Je_tEM5hQWg,417360,419360,gonna get some peanut butter vegetables
Je_tEM5hQWg,419360,421440,this is cowboy it's all just like this
Je_tEM5hQWg,421440,423199,meat you're supposed to kind of gnaw off
Je_tEM5hQWg,423199,425120,um wow yeah this does take some effort
Je_tEM5hQWg,425120,426880,okay so here's a nice piece of protein
Je_tEM5hQWg,426880,428240,you got some there too yeah let's go
Je_tEM5hQWg,428240,429730,fight
Je_tEM5hQWg,429730,431360,[Music]
Je_tEM5hQWg,431360,433440,it's a bit chewy but still juicy and it
Je_tEM5hQWg,433440,435199,tastes like a beef roast or just kind of
Je_tEM5hQWg,435199,437039,like stewed beef but that is in the
Je_tEM5hQWg,437039,438720,middle of cooking that's just a pure
Je_tEM5hQWg,438720,441120,piece of fat
Je_tEM5hQWg,441120,442960,it's a bit rich but actually it's very
Je_tEM5hQWg,442960,445199,flavorful ashley you're crushing it how
Je_tEM5hQWg,445199,446319,do you say delicious in the local
Je_tEM5hQWg,446319,449319,languages

Je_tEM5hQWg,457720,461439,[Music]

Je_tEM5hQWg,467919,469919,prepare for the midday rush with stacks
Je_tEM5hQWg,469919,471759,of grilled and fried chicken ready to

Je_tEM5hQWg,477120,478479,couple of entertainers come to
Je_tEM5hQWg,478479,480400,capitalize on the moment the crowd's
Je_tEM5hQWg,480400,482080,welcoming response is a sign they've
Je_tEM5hQWg,482080,483840,seen this type of show before and

Je_tEM5hQWg,550720,552240,i've been crying the whole day but for
Je_tEM5hQWg,552240,553839,personal reasons not related to the
Je_tEM5hQWg,553839,555920,smoke lightly grill cut it into smaller
Je_tEM5hQWg,555920,557920,pieces and toss it in hot oil so it's
Je_tEM5hQWg,557920,559920,just like a shallow fry there's not even
Je_tEM5hQWg,559920,561680,a lot of oil the only issue now is he's

Je_tEM5hQWg,577200,579600,this place is wild yes it is so what is
Je_tEM5hQWg,579600,581200,the name of this place this is another
Je_tEM5hQWg,581200,582959,area from the place that we just come
Je_tEM5hQWg,582959,585760,from and here they do more of barbecue
Je_tEM5hQWg,585760,587600,on a larger scale so you've got more
Je_tEM5hQWg,587600,589680,options to choose from and definitely
Je_tEM5hQWg,589680,591600,it's mainly chicken over here fried
Je_tEM5hQWg,591600,593200,chicken it's not usually grilled and
Je_tEM5hQWg,593200,595760,then fried but here it is yes it is this
Je_tEM5hQWg,595760,597519,is what we call fried chicken here in
Je_tEM5hQWg,597519,599839,sabah shall we try it out yes i got skin
Je_tEM5hQWg,599839,602000,here
Je_tEM5hQWg,603360,605519,that's good oily fatty skin here's some
Je_tEM5hQWg,605519,607680,of the drumstick
Je_tEM5hQWg,607680,609200,but it's super heavy i like it though
Je_tEM5hQWg,609200,610720,it's simple it's straightforward it's
Je_tEM5hQWg,610720,612399,just salt really but it's interesting to
Je_tEM5hQWg,612399,613680,see a little different style and as
Je_tEM5hQWg,613680,615440,always it's served with the sadzak do
Je_tEM5hQWg,615440,617200,people feel like a meal is incomplete
Je_tEM5hQWg,617200,619279,without satsang certainly i think so
Je_tEM5hQWg,619279,620880,when they do charge you for this meal
Je_tEM5hQWg,620880,623040,usually they don't charge for the satay
Je_tEM5hQWg,623040,624640,what they're challenging you for is for
Je_tEM5hQWg,624640,626399,the meats and salad is sort of like
Je_tEM5hQWg,626399,628320,complimentary so if you were to say i
Je_tEM5hQWg,628320,629600,don't want the salsa you're still going
Je_tEM5hQWg,629600,631200,to pay the same amount
Je_tEM5hQWg,631200,632720,so you'd rather just you know half the
Je_tEM5hQWg,632720,634720,subject anyway we have one more location
Je_tEM5hQWg,634720,636240,we're gonna go somewhere that even blows

Je_tEM5hQWg,674079,676320,the crowds the cars it's like a tailgate
Je_tEM5hQWg,676320,678399,party that never goes to the game a rock
Je_tEM5hQWg,678399,680560,concert where the main star is the meat

Je_tEM5hQWg,683760,685920,in all 300 people work to make this

Je_tEM5hQWg,713760,716000,like servers yes every person that owns
Je_tEM5hQWg,716000,718079,a stole essentially has somebody that
Je_tEM5hQWg,718079,720079,runs around to deliver the food so you

Je_tEM5hQWg,721920,723600,your food will come to your car this is
Je_tEM5hQWg,723600,725680,zimbabwe's version of a drive-in eatery
Je_tEM5hQWg,725680,727279,where the hood of your car becomes your
Je_tEM5hQWg,727279,729120,dining table heck you could never leave
Je_tEM5hQWg,729120,732000,your front seat if you didn't want to
Je_tEM5hQWg,732000,733440,when a runner takes your order they'll
Je_tEM5hQWg,733440,735120,head to the butcher then to whichever

Je_tEM5hQWg,763920,765920,pieces seasoned with salt and spices
Je_tEM5hQWg,765920,768079,then placed on a gas price stand until
Je_tEM5hQWg,768079,770690,they cook through

Je_tEM5hQWg,779760,781120,seasoning on there is delicious it's

Je_tEM5hQWg,784560,786320,there's just this thing that goes around

Je_tEM5hQWg,818639,820959,of people cooking meat the scale
Je_tEM5hQWg,820959,822800,is ridiculous and the amount of meat
Je_tEM5hQWg,822800,824320,coming through here too so when people
Je_tEM5hQWg,824320,826079,order they can order from here if they
Je_tEM5hQWg,826079,827920,want to but most people are ordering
Je_tEM5hQWg,827920,829839,from their car because they can stay at

Je_tEM5hQWg,928959,931279,cooked meat just to be safe because i
Je_tEM5hQWg,931279,932880,know even sushi here is that even a
Je_tEM5hQWg,932880,934480,thing it is you've got a couple of
Je_tEM5hQWg,934480,936160,places that offer it but there's so many
Je_tEM5hQWg,936160,937759,people that are big on oh i'm not gonna

Je_tEM5hQWg,939680,941680,i'll die that is a mentality that is
