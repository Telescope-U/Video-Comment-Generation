001Gqw3BTpQ,80,7359,good morning my darlings this is  actually the third time that i have  tried to start vlogging this morning
001Gqw3BTpQ,7359,13519,each of the previous attempts i have  launched in  with the most boring topic of
001Gqw3BTpQ,13519,19760,conversation and then just stopped  halfway through and stopped filming so  whatever i start going on about now it's
001Gqw3BTpQ,19760,26000,just gonna stay this is just i'm just  gonna make the cut  and i was thinking it's one of those  really random things when you start a
001Gqw3BTpQ,26000,31760,vlog because often you're not with other  people  it's like if you were a radio presenter
001Gqw3BTpQ,31760,36800,and you  are working by yourself i always used to  think how do they how do they just keep
001Gqw3BTpQ,36800,43280,talking  and no one's actually talking back to  them and it's kind of the same when  you're vlogging like unless i'm out
001Gqw3BTpQ,43280,49600,doing something and i've got something  to show you when i pick up the camera to  start vlogging i don't pre-think about
001Gqw3BTpQ,49600,54640,what i'm gonna say like even this  i should probably just cut all of this
001Gqw3BTpQ,54640,61039,out anyway i'm in a very peculiar mood  today and i am going to blame the  weather
001Gqw3BTpQ,61039,67040,british person when in doubt about what  to talk about talk about the weather um  but actually so today is the first
001Gqw3BTpQ,67040,72400,cloudy day or non-sunny day that we've  had in a little while so that means i'm
001Gqw3BTpQ,72400,78080,going to do loads of things in the house  that i have been putting off because i  can't bear to be inside when it's
001Gqw3BTpQ,78080,83360,glorious outside i want to be gardening  i want to be  lying in the sun or working in the sun
001Gqw3BTpQ,83360,90960,so i've put a lot of things off i need  to do a massive tidy up of my dressing  room i've got a bed to change from when
001Gqw3BTpQ,90960,97119,scarlett and maria stayed here while  we're on holiday  um what else yeah a couple of little
001Gqw3BTpQ,97119,102320,couple of little odd bits and bobs um so  that is the plan of action
001Gqw3BTpQ,102320,108479,for today while i'm doing all of that um  i think i'm going to  see now i actually can't remember what
001Gqw3BTpQ,108479,114000,i've mentioned in this  attempt at starting the vlog and what i  mentioned in the previous ones never
001Gqw3BTpQ,114000,121840,mind i'm going to go upstairs and put my  hair in my silk sausage even though it's  dry i hope that it will work last time
001Gqw3BTpQ,121840,129360,when i had the complete epic fail which  was when i went down to wilderness i was  in a car for three hours and i presumed
001Gqw3BTpQ,129360,135120,that it would be absolutely perfect  after that my house was damp and i put  product in so i thought yep this is
001Gqw3BTpQ,135120,140560,going to be the perfect curl situation  but it was completely flat
001Gqw3BTpQ,140560,146000,so now i'm going to attempt it on  completely dry hair  one of you um
001Gqw3BTpQ,146000,152400,recommended to do that and then spray it  with hairspray when it's in the sausage
001Gqw3BTpQ,152400,158720,in my head i don't understand how dry  hair will hold a curl  especially as my hair is
001Gqw3BTpQ,158720,164800,i've got a lot of it but my hair is very  fine um and it's also quite silky  because of the shampoo that i'm using at
001Gqw3BTpQ,164800,172239,the moment but anyway let's give it a  try okay most of my tidying and  unpacking is now complete and i have
001Gqw3BTpQ,172239,178720,some goodies here which i've just opened  which i will quickly whiz through with  you perfect timing for my skin and me
001Gqw3BTpQ,178720,185200,delivery because i just finished my last  one last night that is just the most  perfect timing um
001Gqw3BTpQ,185200,190720,oops so i have got this month's daily  doser in here and this delivery also
001Gqw3BTpQ,190720,198000,contains my moisturizer and my cleanser  so these don't come every month but this  does to ensure that i've always got my
001Gqw3BTpQ,198000,203599,um my skincare and my active ingredients  so i'll be popping that on later also
001Gqw3BTpQ,203599,208879,speaking of um  products that work really well for the  skin
001Gqw3BTpQ,208879,214400,you may recall  many a time i have spoken about my  current body
001Gqw3BTpQ,214400,221840,oh  led face mask well they now have one  which is purely for the eyes so if like
001Gqw3BTpQ,221840,226879,me your main area of  well  i don't want to say concern but an area
001Gqw3BTpQ,226879,232720,that you would like to  work on is around the eye area then this  could be a really interesting product so
001Gqw3BTpQ,232720,238000,i might have a little bit of a pamper  evening tonight and give that a try
001Gqw3BTpQ,238000,244480,what else do we have some lovely new  makeup launches so i've got a selection  of bronzers here from the new collection
001Gqw3BTpQ,244480,249519,from clarins  some really different really lovely  different tones here i feel that that
001Gqw3BTpQ,249519,255680,might be a little bit too warm for me  i think this one's probably going to be  my shade they always give a really
001Gqw3BTpQ,255680,262079,lovely natural color and then this is a  really nice one from a holiday not sure  if you can see but it's got a little bit  of shimmer in there and then of course
001Gqw3BTpQ,262079,268720,you can just swirl your brush around the  pink section if you want to get a little  bit of blush a new foundation delivery
001Gqw3BTpQ,268720,274479,from shiseido i've heard really good  things about this it's called the  synchro skin
001Gqw3BTpQ,274479,282000,radiant lifting foundation and it's spf  30 that does look like a really good  color match for me uh oh an eye cream to
001Gqw3BTpQ,282000,287199,go with the current body  yes i'm looking crazy in the reflection
001Gqw3BTpQ,287199,292240,um actually i don't know if you can see  but half of the curls that i have put in
001Gqw3BTpQ,292240,297600,are starting to unravel where my hair is  pretty soft at the moment i'm using not
001Gqw3BTpQ,297600,303280,this exact shampoo but um  another one from this range from weller  it's actually their hydrate collection
001Gqw3BTpQ,303280,310880,that i'm using at the moment my hair  i can't complain but it is so soft and  it just doesn't want to stay in these um
001Gqw3BTpQ,310880,317360,curlers uh so we've got also from wella  i thought i would get the color  collection because hopefully i'll be
001Gqw3BTpQ,317360,324400,getting my hair  oh my goodness  hopefully getting my hair colored next  week the hair oil is one of the best
001Gqw3BTpQ,324400,329919,oils i have ever tried it's really  lovely and lightweight if you've got  quite fine hairs you don't want an oil
001Gqw3BTpQ,329919,335280,weighing it down i highly recommend  these ones from weller
001Gqw3BTpQ,335280,341919,guys  not with it today  um and then i did order a couple of  products which i thought might help with
001Gqw3BTpQ,341919,349199,my heatless waves this is the perfect  setting lotion spray so i'll be giving  that a go next time i wash my hair
001Gqw3BTpQ,349199,356319,um and then just a couple of lovely  masks this one is the nutri enriched  goji berry deep nourishing mask and then
001Gqw3BTpQ,356319,361840,this one is from the oil reflect oil  reflections range like the hair oil so i
001Gqw3BTpQ,361840,367759,thought that would be a really lovely  mask to try out and then this is a hair  mousse and apparently using a hair
001Gqw3BTpQ,367759,374960,mousse when you are using the dyson air  wrap really helps the curls to last so  i'll be giving that a try
001Gqw3BTpQ,374960,381360,uh we've also had a delivery from soru  the most beautiful jewelry brand just
001Gqw3BTpQ,381360,388160,pop you on there so that we can  open it up with two hands oh my gosh
001Gqw3BTpQ,388240,394960,look at this  that is the most beautiful ring oh my
001Gqw3BTpQ,394960,401600,goodness it looks like the kind of ring  that you would get from jewelers which  costs like millions
001Gqw3BTpQ,401600,408560,millions it is so beautiful i wonder if  they actually make it any smaller  because unfortunately this is really
001Gqw3BTpQ,408560,413919,much too big for me  um  but because of the design i wonder if  they do make it smaller so what i'm
001Gqw3BTpQ,413919,420000,going to have to do is put a ring  adjuster but potentially it doesn't in  which case i can sorry my dress wants to
001Gqw3BTpQ,420000,427440,be the focal focal point of the camera  yeah otherwise i'll just put a ring  adjuster on it i mean how beautiful
001Gqw3BTpQ,427440,433039,such a statement piece  number two oh this is so gorgeous oh my
001Gqw3BTpQ,433039,440720,goodness that one fits better still a  tiny bit big  this collection is so beautiful can you
001Gqw3BTpQ,440720,446319,see it's the most delicate flower with a  pearly center it looks similar it's the
001Gqw3BTpQ,446319,454639,little jewelry pouch that i took with me  to barcelona and i took these earrings  with me which are also from sorew i i
001Gqw3BTpQ,454639,460319,wore these earrings during christmas and  the ring kind of matches i would  definitely wear them together that's a
001Gqw3BTpQ,460319,467599,really gorgeous combination and can you  see the actual little focus but the  actual band of the ring
001Gqw3BTpQ,467599,473599,is so stunning gosh their pieces really  are just divine these look like
001Gqw3BTpQ,473599,478639,something that samantha from sex in the  city would love  giving me those kinds of vibes is
001Gqw3BTpQ,478639,484400,essentially the ring but as a stud  earring i can't even hold them up to my  face to show you how it look right now
001Gqw3BTpQ,484400,490639,because my hair looks so ridiculous can  you see how it's do you know what i am  actually just gonna have to take this  out because it has not worked in the
001Gqw3BTpQ,490639,497199,slightest they obviously look a little  bit crazy while i'm not wearing any  makeup but i think they will look
001Gqw3BTpQ,497199,504720,absolutely  stunning when i am a little bit more  made up and maybe i'll wear these  tonight for our lovely dinner i just
001Gqw3BTpQ,504720,511039,suddenly thought charlie's booked this  special dinner tonight i hope there's  not an occasion that i'm forgetting
001Gqw3BTpQ,511039,516479,about because it's a really it's a  michelin star restaurant and he's like  oh we're going here for dinner tonight
001Gqw3BTpQ,516479,523200,it's not our anniversary  you shouldn't not that you should need  an excuse to go to a lovely restaurant
001Gqw3BTpQ,523200,529760,okay first chore of the day done i have  made the bed  in the pink room where scarlett stayed
001Gqw3BTpQ,529760,536560,um and i've just shared this on my  instagram stories so i'll let you guys  know as well i have a new um special
001Gqw3BTpQ,536560,543519,offer with linen bundle my favorites  that have got the most beautiful quality  bed line and this is their cream set
001Gqw3BTpQ,543519,549440,which if like me you looked for ages for  some non-white bed linen so you can see
001Gqw3BTpQ,549440,555279,the color difference here between the  white cover and the cream bed linen  because i often find that white just
001Gqw3BTpQ,555279,562480,looks it looks very modern it looks very  new and  i just i prefer bed linen to be a little
001Gqw3BTpQ,562480,568399,bit softer and more cozy and i find that  their cream color is absolutely perfect  i've also mentioned a million times i
001Gqw3BTpQ,568399,575440,just think that the quality of their bed  sheets is so lovely um and we have this  exact color in our bedroom as well they
001Gqw3BTpQ,575440,582720,must have been in the wash a hundred  times and they still are literally as  good as new um so my offer this time is
001Gqw3BTpQ,582720,591200,josie  home 45 and that will get you 45 off  site wide and also a free pair of
001Gqw3BTpQ,591200,597360,pillows when you spend over 115 pounds  um and you can choose non-feather

001Gqw3BTpQ,602640,607839,cottage so um yeah it's an amazing deal  and i highly highly recommend checking
001Gqw3BTpQ,607839,614000,out linen bundle they also very kindly  sent me some of their new designs  they've got some patterned ones which
001Gqw3BTpQ,614000,619200,you can really mix and match so we've  got this sweet little bumblebee i chose  the ones which are
001Gqw3BTpQ,619200,625519,the most countryside-y ones i think this  is a chamomile do they call it their  chamomile flower
001Gqw3BTpQ,625519,631040,chamomile and b print so i have a  feeling that the inside of this one is
001Gqw3BTpQ,631040,638000,actually  this print  and then i thought the bottom sheet  would be really lovely in this straw
001Gqw3BTpQ,638000,643760,yellow  so they've got some gorgeous new prints  as well as the plain sets
001Gqw3BTpQ,643760,650320,which you can pick and mix from and  they'll also be included in my 45 off  discount hello again darlings it's a few
001Gqw3BTpQ,650320,656079,hours later we've had the most relaxing  afternoon just watching a film we
001Gqw3BTpQ,656079,662320,watched something new on sky cinema and  i  dozed in and out of sleep to have a
001Gqw3BTpQ,662320,667519,fairly late night last night but now  i've got on my beautiful seraphina dress
001Gqw3BTpQ,667519,674079,and we are heading to the royal oak i've  just been on their instagram and i think  the food is going to be really amazing i
001Gqw3BTpQ,674079,680320,didn't as you saw my hair  did not do anything in the roller  earlier
001Gqw3BTpQ,680320,687200,um so i have just kept it back in a bun  and i feel like that is where these  earrings come in very very handy if you
001Gqw3BTpQ,687200,693839,want to still look  glam like you've made an effort um but  you really can't be able to do your hair
001Gqw3BTpQ,693839,698959,then adding a lovely pair of earrings i  think it does a great job and on this  hand even though it's much too big i am
001Gqw3BTpQ,698959,704240,wearing at the matching ring it's not  going to bother me that much but it just  ties in
001Gqw3BTpQ,704240,712950,so beautifully so i've got my sorrow and  my seraphina two beautiful brands this  is my outfit of the evening
001Gqw3BTpQ,712950,719279,[Music]  we've had our amusement and now we have
001Gqw3BTpQ,719279,725440,got a what did he call it a whole grain  um  it was a brioche i think
001Gqw3BTpQ,725440,732639,[Music]  and uh a wild garlic butter and the wild
001Gqw3BTpQ,732639,738720,garlic is from a village nearby  the butter is churned two miles away
001Gqw3BTpQ,738720,746959,cool scratching and we've just been told  the story about the where the flower is  milled just a couple of miles from us
001Gqw3BTpQ,746959,750160,that's going to be amazing
001Gqw3BTpQ,752240,756839,i can't wait to try this lunch
001Gqw3BTpQ,759290,765040,[Music]
001Gqw3BTpQ,765040,772079,hello darlings back home again and i  love that it's still light outside we  are approaching the summer solstice
001Gqw3BTpQ,772079,779120,which is the longest longest day of the  year and i think the sun sets at 20 past  nine that makes me very happy indeed the
001Gqw3BTpQ,779120,784800,meal was incredible  we knew it would be it's nice because it  was
001Gqw3BTpQ,784800,791200,obviously a michelin star restaurant but  also felt a little bit more relaxed like  no none of this kind of smart white
001Gqw3BTpQ,791200,796959,tablecloths that kind of formality that  you expect with a michelin star  restaurant but lots of small very
001Gqw3BTpQ,796959,803279,exciting  super tasty um little plates and most of  the ingredients were sourced locally
001Gqw3BTpQ,803279,809760,and what i loved was that every time a  dish was placed in front of us we'd get  a story about it as well not just
001Gqw3BTpQ,809760,815839,being told what it was but also about  the farmer who  milled the flower for the bread and how
001Gqw3BTpQ,815839,821360,if he if there's too much rain for  example and he can't mill the flower  there's just no bread that week um so
001Gqw3BTpQ,821360,828959,everything had a really lovely story  behind it from michelin star restaurant  as well i think we only booked it a week  ago um so if you are in this area i
001Gqw3BTpQ,828959,837120,would definitely recommend a visit to  the royal oak at watford is that right  watford  royal oak what what cut what get um so
001Gqw3BTpQ,837120,845519,as you can see i have taken off my  makeup  in my usual way and now i'm going to be  applying my new new this month's new
001Gqw3BTpQ,845519,851279,daily dosa  um so  as i mentioned earlier this month i've
001Gqw3BTpQ,851279,858079,got my full routine it says in here my  morning routine and my evening routine  so cleanse the moisturizer and spf in
001Gqw3BTpQ,858079,865360,the morning and cleanse our daily dose  and moisturizer in the evening so i've  already done my cleanser so my next step
001Gqw3BTpQ,865360,870399,is to use my daily dose up also in here  and one thing that i just love about
001Gqw3BTpQ,870399,876959,skin and me is that there's no excess  packaging there's not a load of plastic  this is made from aluminium so that's
001Gqw3BTpQ,876959,882480,recyclable or they're very conscious of  not having any unnecessary plastics
001Gqw3BTpQ,882480,887680,i've said many a time that my daily dose  of from skin and me is probably the one
001Gqw3BTpQ,887680,894399,thing within my skin care products  things that i actually put on my face  that makes the biggest difference and i
001Gqw3BTpQ,894399,902079,recommended it to so many friends and so  many of them are fully converted  um i do have my special offer
001Gqw3BTpQ,902079,907839,again which will give you the first  month for three pound fifty i'll leave  it on the screen here you need to use
001Gqw3BTpQ,907839,914880,the code josie six this month to get  that offer guys if you have if you  haven't started using skin and me yet
001Gqw3BTpQ,914880,920399,this is your sign this is your sign to  start it no more messing around with  loads of different products with active
001Gqw3BTpQ,920399,927760,ingredients because with skin and me you  fill out a very quick consultation  online it takes just a couple of minutes
001Gqw3BTpQ,927760,933920,and then your skincare goal for example  mine was to make my pores look smaller  yours might be
001Gqw3BTpQ,933920,940399,anti-aging or reducing your blemishes  your answers a couple of photos that you  take and
001Gqw3BTpQ,940399,945680,your skincare goal is looked at by a  team of experts and then your perfect
001Gqw3BTpQ,945680,952079,product is designed just for you so you  don't need to spend loads of money or  loads of time finding a dermatologist or
001Gqw3BTpQ,952079,957360,playing around with loads of different  active ingredients from shop bought  products this literally has
001Gqw3BTpQ,957360,963279,the exact formulation that your skin  needs so i have got a selection of  active ingredients in here that are
001Gqw3BTpQ,963279,969920,designed for me and i can see from the  percentages here of my daily of my  active ingredients that over time i wish
001Gqw3BTpQ,969920,976480,i kept my first tube but over time the  percentage of the active ingredients has  been gradually increased so that i don't
001Gqw3BTpQ,976480,982959,um so that i continue to notice benefits  i'm gonna apply this while um while we  chat so because it's an active
001Gqw3BTpQ,982959,990639,ingredient you don't want it to be there  we go you just twist it until you hear  the click  no air can get into here so it's would
001Gqw3BTpQ,990639,996680,you call it encapsulated it's just like  a little very light cream
001Gqw3BTpQ,1000320,1005920,and i just press that onto my skin my  routine is applying this to cleanse skin
001Gqw3BTpQ,1005920,1011120,um and then i i usually give it about 10  minutes before i put anything else on my  skin
001Gqw3BTpQ,1011120,1018320,i'll pop on the skin and me moisturizer  i also like to put on my elizabeth arden
001Gqw3BTpQ,1018320,1023360,ceramide capsules i find that these work  really nicely with the skin and me daily
001Gqw3BTpQ,1023360,1029839,dosa because  i would say that you can never  hydrate your skin too much because of
001Gqw3BTpQ,1029839,1036240,the nature of active ingredients your  skin is essentially working really hard  while you sleep resurfacing regenerating
001Gqw3BTpQ,1036240,1042480,renewing so it just adds  comfort  and ensures that your skin is glowing
001Gqw3BTpQ,1042480,1049520,when you wake up if you also apply a  plethora of moisturizing products  afterwards as hayley beaver says in all
001Gqw3BTpQ,1049520,1055360,of her skincare videos you should go to  bed with a face that looks like a glazed  donut which i think is brilliant okay
001Gqw3BTpQ,1055360,1062720,it's about 10 minutes later now so i'm  going to apply  my moisturizer this is a really light
001Gqw3BTpQ,1062720,1069760,moisturizer and  there is absolutely nothing wrong with  layering this with your other favorites
001Gqw3BTpQ,1069760,1076000,literally arrived in the perfect time  because i had just finished my last one
001Gqw3BTpQ,1076000,1081919,there we go so for a long time i believe  skin and me just made the daily dosa  which
001Gqw3BTpQ,1081919,1088480,i mean this is this is the game changing  product but i love that now they've got  the cleanser and the moisturizer again
001Gqw3BTpQ,1088480,1094720,it just takes the guesswork out you  don't need to think oh gosh has that  product got ingredients in it which i'm  not going to go with my routine because
001Gqw3BTpQ,1094720,1101440,you do have to be a little bit more  careful when you are using active  ingredients they do  the reason why you see such a change in
001Gqw3BTpQ,1101440,1107200,your skin is because they're actually  doing something so using the full skin  and me range just for me helps to take
001Gqw3BTpQ,1107200,1113600,the guesswork out and make sure that  everything i'm applying to my skin is  working really well together
001Gqw3BTpQ,1113600,1121039,hopefully if you guys go back like a  year a year and a half in my videos you  can really see the difference in my skin
001Gqw3BTpQ,1121039,1127440,i certainly notice it hugely so now i'll  just wait  another maybe 10 minutes or so i like to
001Gqw3BTpQ,1127440,1134320,give all of my products that i apply to  my face time to absorb to sink in and  then i'll pop on one of my ceramide
001Gqw3BTpQ,1134320,1141679,capsules  and then i've got another really lovely  quite thick elizabeth arden um night
001Gqw3BTpQ,1141679,1148880,cream so i'll apply that later but my  daily dosa is what is working it working  the magic and
001Gqw3BTpQ,1148880,1154160,really improving my skin  so yes i will leave my link and my code
001Gqw3BTpQ,1154160,1160400,in the description box down below josie6  will get you your first month for three  pound 50 which is amazing usually i
001Gqw3BTpQ,1160400,1168000,believe 24.99  as i've said 10 million times could not  recommend any more highly i love it all
001Gqw3BTpQ,1168000,1173760,my friends love it and i know that you  guys are going to love it so i'm gonna  complete my evening routine and i will
001Gqw3BTpQ,1173760,1177559,see you guys in the morning
001Gqw3BTpQ,1205760,1212799,good morning  good morning my darlings  it is a beautiful very calm sunday
001Gqw3BTpQ,1212799,1218720,morning  and charlie's still in bed and yet i  just wanted to get straight outside and
001Gqw3BTpQ,1218720,1224880,do a few little gardening chores so as  you've just seen i've done  some dead heading this morning
001Gqw3BTpQ,1224880,1230400,even though lots of these lupines still  have beautiful flowers on and you guys  know how
001Gqw3BTpQ,1230400,1236559,i hate wasting any flowers i want to  make the most of everything however with  lupins
001Gqw3BTpQ,1236559,1242240,i think it's quite unattractive when  they start to go over  and actually if you prune them and if
001Gqw3BTpQ,1242240,1247520,you have any lupines at home you can  prune them literally just underneath the  flower
001Gqw3BTpQ,1247520,1253360,then that will encourage  some new little flowers like you can see  this one here it will just give them the
001Gqw3BTpQ,1253360,1259440,space and the energy oh there's quite a  few actually the more you look the more  you find um gives them the energy oh
001Gqw3BTpQ,1259440,1265039,look tiny tiny tiny tiny one here yes  it'll put the energy into um helping
001Gqw3BTpQ,1265039,1270400,them grow as opposed to the energy going  into these going to seed and with lupins
001Gqw3BTpQ,1270400,1275520,i don't really think there's a point  that's too soon to prune them please  correct me if i'm wrong
001Gqw3BTpQ,1275520,1281600,but in my experience with this bush and  this was grown from seed last year omg
001Gqw3BTpQ,1281600,1286960,um i just find as soon as they start to  look a little bit unattractive i snip  them
001Gqw3BTpQ,1286960,1292720,so i'm going to do a few more of the  lupine bushes i've done some of the  roses i've done some cosmos peonies
001Gqw3BTpQ,1292720,1298080,and other bits and bobs and i've also  realized that i need to put some  supports on the roses down there so i'll
001Gqw3BTpQ,1298080,1303679,do that later  but i'm going to carry on just  deadheading the lupines in this border
001Gqw3BTpQ,1303679,1309440,i also need to pick some lavender  because i'm going to make a lemon and  lavender cake this morning
001Gqw3BTpQ,1309440,1315039,but yeah it's a beautiful morning  sunday morning pruning and enjoying my
001Gqw3BTpQ,1315039,1325919,cup of coffee  [Music]
001Gqw3BTpQ,1325919,1332400,hello again darlings we're finally  dressed and makeup and hair done ready  for seeing charlie's family today i've
001Gqw3BTpQ,1332400,1339520,popped on at the same jewelry as last  night i just love these earrings and  i've got the ring on the other hand as  well um i didn't leave myself enough
001Gqw3BTpQ,1339520,1347280,time to bake the lemon and lavender cake  which is a shame i always forget that a  lemon loaf needs 50 minutes in the oven
001Gqw3BTpQ,1347280,1353360,so i'd need an hour and a half and we're  leaving in half an hour very silly of me  i just didn't realize where the time was
001Gqw3BTpQ,1353360,1358720,going um so instead i have emptied my  deadheads from the bucket i'm going to
001Gqw3BTpQ,1358720,1364559,put a couple of inches of water in the  bottom here and i'm just going to fill  this with flowers from the garden and
001Gqw3BTpQ,1364559,1372640,then when we get to charlie's mom and  dad's house  i will  arrange everything into a lovely display
001Gqw3BTpQ,1372640,1378020,to have on the table or in posey glasses  whatever viv has got lying around the  house
001Gqw3BTpQ,1378020,1404890,[Music]
001Gqw3BTpQ,1406480,1439069,so  [Music]
001Gqw3BTpQ,1439279,1445919,so scarlettina is off for a very  exciting night tonight doesn't she look  glam you literally remind me of like my
001Gqw3BTpQ,1445919,1452640,childhood in the 90s with the  featherboards like harry styles well  you look like you're going to see harry
001Gqw3BTpQ,1452640,1458000,style  and for the ultimate 90s experience  scars one has got where do you even buy

001Gqw3BTpQ,1465039,1470080,hair you clamp them on so i don't know  if you can see my hair oh my gosh as  modelled by a skirt one
001Gqw3BTpQ,1470080,1475919,i feel like it's the kind of thing that  my age group used to get uh marketed on  like nickelodeon yeah during the advert
001Gqw3BTpQ,1475919,1481440,definitely my mom never let me get like  the toys  but now i'm getting there bling my hair
001Gqw3BTpQ,1481440,1487200,dying which side um i mean wherever  i'm actually quite nervous this is going
001Gqw3BTpQ,1487200,1491919,to be the new the new trend confusion  you're handy
001Gqw3BTpQ,1493679,1500080,oh my god  it's like an ear piercing gun and that  is amazing and so when you get home at
001Gqw3BTpQ,1500080,1507440,like three a.m you're gonna have to  individually pick these awesome things  claims on the fact that you can brush  them out oh so okay let's see one more
001Gqw3BTpQ,1507440,1513360,on this side i've got lots of different  colors like it came with like a pack of  20 different colors
001Gqw3BTpQ,1513360,1518960,i'm gonna do some silver ones to add a  bit of  some cute depth  what do we think
001Gqw3BTpQ,1518960,1522960,bring it back for spring summer 2023
001Gqw3BTpQ,1524000,1530480,amazing  i mean it goes with your outfit it  doesn't go without i really like it
001Gqw3BTpQ,1530480,1535840,so we've just got back home and  this probably won't show up on my camera
001Gqw3BTpQ,1535840,1542480,but i've just shared some stories  because the sky  is quite literally pink you can kind of
001Gqw3BTpQ,1542480,1549120,see on the camera it looks really warm  but  it's like pink candy floss in the sky
001Gqw3BTpQ,1549120,1554799,it's actually magical  if my little pony has made skies can you  see that
001Gqw3BTpQ,1554799,1562000,it's amazing  someone said that the  rain had sand from the sahara desert in
001Gqw3BTpQ,1562000,1567919,it  and maybe that's the pink in the  atmosphere  but it's magical
001Gqw3BTpQ,1567919,1571480,it's so magical
001Gqw3BTpQ,1574640,1581130,anyway  we're off to bed to watch silent witness
001Gqw3BTpQ,1581130,1588240,[Music]
001Gqw3BTpQ,1588240,1594960,good morning my darlings it is now the  next day i have realized that you are  going to be watching this video on a
001Gqw3BTpQ,1594960,1602159,sunday so i thought i would share with  you a few of the new things in my  wardrobe i've been doing a few more
001Gqw3BTpQ,1602159,1607600,fashion collaborations over on my  instagram lately um and i always like to
001Gqw3BTpQ,1607600,1614400,show you guys new things in my wardrobe  as well and a lot of these are high  street pieces so really fantastic price
001Gqw3BTpQ,1614400,1620159,points if you have got any weddings  coming up these are some fantastic  wedding guest outfits um but also just
001Gqw3BTpQ,1620159,1625919,really lovely things to wear on a daily  basis or for special events throughout  summer so i'm gonna get started with a
001Gqw3BTpQ,1625919,1631600,few from dorothy perkins and they really  blew me away with the styles and designs
001Gqw3BTpQ,1631600,1637120,that they have got at the moment and  price point wise and quality combined i
001Gqw3BTpQ,1637120,1644480,think is the best value pieces i have  seen in a very long time so first of all  i am in love with this little dress i
001Gqw3BTpQ,1644480,1651679,love the blue and white floral pattern  i'm not usually a blue  lover i tend to lean more towards the
001Gqw3BTpQ,1651679,1657279,greens if this did have green instead of  the blue i would probably love it even  more but there's something very
001Gqw3BTpQ,1657279,1662399,classical  very traditional about this blue and  white pattern it certainly looks like it
001Gqw3BTpQ,1662399,1669440,could be from a designer that's far more  expensive i will show you a little i  will show you how it looks full length
001Gqw3BTpQ,1669440,1675360,here and i also want to point out to you  the footwear so this is a pair of shoes
001Gqw3BTpQ,1675360,1680399,again from dorothy perkins i'll leave  everything linked down below yes very
001Gqw3BTpQ,1680399,1685440,similar in design to my valentino rock  studs  super comfortable i have worn these for
001Gqw3BTpQ,1685440,1693039,a full day thanks to chunky block heel  and i never really considered dorothy  perkins for footwear before river island
001Gqw3BTpQ,1693039,1698960,was normally my go-to when it came to  really good quality  and very affordable footwear um but
001Gqw3BTpQ,1698960,1704880,after the success of these which i'm so  impressed with i will definitely be  keeping an eye on dorothy perkins
001Gqw3BTpQ,1704880,1712320,footwear next time i'm browsing their  website the second dress from dorothy  perkins and this one i used as the main
001Gqw3BTpQ,1712320,1718240,grid image on my instagram so you might  have already spotted this one the fabric  again is such a beautiful pattern
001Gqw3BTpQ,1718240,1724000,personally  i would say that this is wedding at  guest appropriate because it's not a
001Gqw3BTpQ,1724000,1730720,white dress it's a floral dress but let  me know your thoughts on wedding guest  etiquette down below personally for my
001Gqw3BTpQ,1730720,1737200,own wedding i would be thrilled if  someone wore this it's such a lovely  elegant design i love the fluted sleeves
001Gqw3BTpQ,1737200,1742320,i always i'm a huge fan of a floral  pattern the material clings to the body
001Gqw3BTpQ,1742320,1747679,in all the right places and what i'm  going to do is pop the video clips that  i shot with cat up on the screen here
001Gqw3BTpQ,1747679,1754480,because i feel like they show the dress  off even better it's also got a really  lovely back detail these little buttons
001Gqw3BTpQ,1754480,1760080,it does mean that you need a little bit  of help getting into the dress and then  just skimming you on the hips and a
001Gqw3BTpQ,1760080,1766240,really lovely very delicate kind of  fishtail skirt again super affordable
001Gqw3BTpQ,1766240,1771520,and  also really classic so a lovely one to  have in your wardrobe for wedding events
001Gqw3BTpQ,1771520,1778080,for wedding guests and any other lovely  summer garden parties you might have  coming up in your diary okay so we are
001Gqw3BTpQ,1778080,1783600,moving up slightly slightly a higher  price point to debenhams they have an
001Gqw3BTpQ,1783600,1789440,incredible selection of brands they have  got they've got loads of different  brands um that you can shop from the own
001Gqw3BTpQ,1789440,1794480,retailers websites but then also lots of  debenhams brands if that makes sense and  i believe
001Gqw3BTpQ,1794480,1800640,this dress it's from a brand called  principles i believe that is one of  debenham's brands i may be wrong but
001Gqw3BTpQ,1800640,1808240,that is what i think is to be correct so  the dress actually is a fairly plain  silhouette but i have added the waist
001Gqw3BTpQ,1808240,1814960,belt from my lk bennett dress you could  literally just get a strip of white  linen i think that looks really cute a
001Gqw3BTpQ,1814960,1820320,really sweet way of just cinching in  around the waist today i felt like i  wanted it to be a bit more feminine but
001Gqw3BTpQ,1820320,1825600,in the photos i styled it with a raffia  belt and that looks equally as fabulous
001Gqw3BTpQ,1825600,1832480,also to be a little bit different today  i've kept on the dorothy perkins studded  sandals they i feel like are so
001Gqw3BTpQ,1832480,1838399,versatile just the same as the  valentinos they're gonna be the kind of  shoe that goes with everything i feel
001Gqw3BTpQ,1838399,1844480,that this could be a really lovely  summer work dress if you were able to  wear things like this to work i know
001Gqw3BTpQ,1844480,1851120,that next time i go for a day of  meetings in london and this is  definitely going to be the kind of dress  i'll be wearing you can create a
001Gqw3BTpQ,1851120,1857279,slightly more voluminous sleeve because  you've got that little bit of  elastication there and then the classic
001Gqw3BTpQ,1857279,1864240,shirt style collar gives it those  smarter vibes and then lengthwise very  demure so just takes all the boxes for a
001Gqw3BTpQ,1864240,1871200,work wear dress but then you can add a  little hint of your personality with the  belt so today i'm feeling feminine so
001Gqw3BTpQ,1871200,1877840,i've added the little bow  no pockets um but really nice  lightweight cotton material there's
001Gqw3BTpQ,1877840,1885200,plenty of fabric in the skirt which just  makes it dramatic  and i really love this color it's quite
001Gqw3BTpQ,1885200,1891200,a bold green color not like the muted  sagey eucalyptus tones i usually go with
001Gqw3BTpQ,1891200,1897039,it's a little bit brighter but  definitely one that will have people  turning heads and saying oh what a
001Gqw3BTpQ,1897039,1902480,lovely dress  definitely leaning towards these more  colorful pieces at the moment as we head
001Gqw3BTpQ,1902480,1908399,into summer we're now officially in the  summer hallelujah i think at the  beginning of this video i said we're  approaching summer solstice that has now
001Gqw3BTpQ,1908399,1914799,passed we're a little bit higgledy  piggly time-wise um but i will explain  all of that in the next vlog
001Gqw3BTpQ,1914799,1921200,but anyway let me show you full length  the bow just looks so sweet
001Gqw3BTpQ,1921200,1926320,a nice contrast to the green  and the sun has come out how glorious
001Gqw3BTpQ,1926320,1932159,which probably which hopefully means you  can see me better but i cannot see you  so hopefully i'm actually standing in
001Gqw3BTpQ,1932159,1938320,the right place this next one is another  from principals at devenums it's another  one that i shot on my instagram i will
001Gqw3BTpQ,1938320,1944480,put the photos up on the screen here  i've got a little kind of crop top vest  bralette type thing on today very very
001Gqw3BTpQ,1944480,1949600,relaxed day um but i thought it looked  quite nice with the neckline really open
001Gqw3BTpQ,1949600,1954720,but of course you can do it up you could  wear it all the way done up if you  wanted it to be quite a preppy style
001Gqw3BTpQ,1954720,1961600,shirt dress but on a summer's day i  think it's quite nice to not have  anything too close to the skin be a  little bit looser a little bit lighter
001Gqw3BTpQ,1961600,1968000,similarly to the last one you've got  more of a shirt style collar slightly  more of a kind of oversized
001Gqw3BTpQ,1968000,1974000,shirt style sleeve with a little turn up  and it does actually come with its own  belt in this material but as you will
001Gqw3BTpQ,1974000,1979679,have seen from the pictures i think it's  quite like one color so i've done the
001Gqw3BTpQ,1979679,1985440,the same linen bow trick here it does  need an iron if i was heading out the  house i would definitely give this an
001Gqw3BTpQ,1985440,1992240,iron um but again it just creates a  little bit of cinched in silhouette  you've got a really lovely shirt dress
001Gqw3BTpQ,1992240,1998720,style silhouette and i think that this  lemony yellow is a color that suits  every skin tone i think it is so
001Gqw3BTpQ,1998720,2005440,flattering um  and it just really  kind of sorbet very fresh for a summer
001Gqw3BTpQ,2005440,2011120,dress so again a great work-wear dress  probably in my opinion a bit too casual  for a wedding guest dress although the
001Gqw3BTpQ,2011120,2016960,one that i wore  the last one the green one i think could  work for a slightly more casual wedding
001Gqw3BTpQ,2016960,2024000,whereas this one i think is a bit more  worky um but yeah another fabulous one  devnets are smashing it and
001Gqw3BTpQ,2024000,2029679,footwear wise i spotted gosh i'm being  dazzled it's one of those weird days  where it's sunny but it's actually
001Gqw3BTpQ,2029679,2034720,raining um i spotted these shoes on  debenhams and a similar pair which i've
001Gqw3BTpQ,2034720,2042240,got like a twist and also these in  white  and i think black as well so if you are
001Gqw3BTpQ,2042240,2047760,in love with this style of shoe i  personally think they're incredibly  versatile then i'll leave these and the
001Gqw3BTpQ,2047760,2054800,twisted ones linked down below i think  they're both under 50 pounds which is  amazing because the bottega ones which
001Gqw3BTpQ,2054800,2061520,these are kind of similar to  literally have a zero on that price i  think the potato ones oh my gosh are
001Gqw3BTpQ,2061520,2066800,over 500 pounds  okay so this outfit is giving me major
001Gqw3BTpQ,2066800,2072158,bindi owen vibes and if you know who she  is and you also like the kind of content
001Gqw3BTpQ,2072158,2078560,that i post here on my channel then i'm  pretty sure that we could be best  friends i used to be so obsessed with
001Gqw3BTpQ,2078560,2085118,steve owen i actually saw him i'm gonna  give away give it away who she is now um  but i actually saw steve irwin at the
001Gqw3BTpQ,2085118,2091520,australia zoo obviously obviously before  he was very tragically killed um but
001Gqw3BTpQ,2091520,2097440,yeah i used to be so obsessed with the  crocodile hunter and i do follow bindi  on instagram and this is the kind of
001Gqw3BTpQ,2097440,2103200,thing that she wears  i think the australia zoo  this is so dorky i think the australia
001Gqw3BTpQ,2103200,2110160,zoo uniform is like this kind of color  shirt that is not why i purchased this  but um that's just the vibes that i'm
001Gqw3BTpQ,2110160,2117040,getting now that i've got it on so this  is one of the amazon the drop shirt  dresses i have it in white which i love
001Gqw3BTpQ,2117040,2122160,i know that so many of you absolutely  love it as well it's such a classic and  i thought it'd be really nice to see how
001Gqw3BTpQ,2122160,2128720,it looks in this stoney  linen color as well i've paired it with  my lure belt you've got the little
001Gqw3BTpQ,2128720,2135200,pockets lengthwise just below the knee  again a really great workwear dress  relaxing around the house kind of dress
001Gqw3BTpQ,2135200,2142720,and styled up with the belt and the  valentino rockstar tube kind of shoes i  think it looks really lovely so yes if
001Gqw3BTpQ,2142720,2148800,there's something that i love almost as  much as floral dresses it is shirt  dresses and this is just something a
001Gqw3BTpQ,2148800,2153839,little bit different to my classic white  ones to add to my wardrobe
001Gqw3BTpQ,2153839,2162079,i thought i would try it with my new  holland cooper straw  fedora fedora or federer roger federer
001Gqw3BTpQ,2162079,2170280,fedora hat i think um for even more  kind of crocodile hunter vibes
001Gqw3BTpQ,2173760,2181040,i do love a straw hat and this one is  just a classic going to the beach  convertible car giving you hat hair
001Gqw3BTpQ,2181040,2187119,but also great hat for me it doesn't  look i don't think it looks so good with  this shirt dress great hat for me for
001Gqw3BTpQ,2187119,2192880,gardening to keep the sun off my face  and at the top of my back as well
001Gqw3BTpQ,2192880,2198400,okay we're briefly back to debenhams and  i'm not sure how i feel about this i
001Gqw3BTpQ,2198400,2205839,really like how comfortable it is very  easy to throw on although i am getting  art teacher vibes i think this reminds
001Gqw3BTpQ,2205839,2211760,me of the art wrap around apron that we  used to have to wear during lessons at  school i think maybe because of the
001Gqw3BTpQ,2211760,2217280,little tie down on the side but i know  that so many people love wrap dresses i  think the color of this is great it
001Gqw3BTpQ,2217280,2223040,would be a great dress for poshing  around the garden but i don't ever want  to buy dresses just for the sake of
001Gqw3BTpQ,2223040,2229440,wearing while gardening it's always like  a wonderful bonus but not the reason why  i buy something and maybe this is just
001Gqw3BTpQ,2229440,2236720,too much gardening vibes  i will try adding some raffia oh do you  know i like it more with the hat could i
001Gqw3BTpQ,2236720,2242560,wear a raffia belt with this  my hair is over curly because i only  just did it
001Gqw3BTpQ,2242560,2247839,but hopefully that will drop  it's amazing how many things i love more
001Gqw3BTpQ,2247839,2254400,once i add a belt  i feel like it just needed breaking up a
001Gqw3BTpQ,2254400,2259680,little bit  what do we think
001Gqw3BTpQ,2259680,2265839,i feel like this is such a nice oh i'm  just pottering around exploring the  cotswolds don't want to get the sun on
001Gqw3BTpQ,2265839,2271760,my face that kind of vibe  yeah i think i've fallen in love with  this outfit
001Gqw3BTpQ,2271760,2278400,so here we are with a josie classic a  rosary white dress and this is from  another of my absolute favorite
001Gqw3BTpQ,2278400,2283680,retailers that does the most incredible  incredibly priced pieces and it is
001Gqw3BTpQ,2283680,2290240,nobody's child so we know that these  fabrics are going to have been sold  sustainably they grow they really invest
001Gqw3BTpQ,2290240,2297760,in their farmers who are growing organic  cotton because it can be really hard for  farmers to justify the cost of turning
001Gqw3BTpQ,2297760,2303040,their farm into an organic farm so  nobody's child really support them  through that process they really put so
001Gqw3BTpQ,2303040,2309119,much focus on sustainability and i love  them for it and yet you're not ending up  paying crazy high prices for their
001Gqw3BTpQ,2309119,2315359,incredible materials and their designs  are absolutely gorgeous so it's no  surprise that i'm a huge huge fan of
001Gqw3BTpQ,2315359,2321200,nobody's child  this dress is the most gorgeous rotary  english fabrics fab rick can't talk
001Gqw3BTpQ,2321200,2326480,today um with this lovely floral kind of  cut out detail and then the embroidery
001Gqw3BTpQ,2326480,2333200,detail here little puff sleeves with  elasticated detail up there smocked  around the waist so super comfortable
001Gqw3BTpQ,2333200,2341440,and a really lovely elegant length an  absolute winner in my opinion very  comfortable a perfect dress for wearing
001Gqw3BTpQ,2341440,2346720,every day a perfect everyday summer  dress  so i do as i mentioned have this funny
001Gqw3BTpQ,2346720,2355720,kind of crop top thing on underneath  however the back of this dress is a  really lovely low
001Gqw3BTpQ,2355839,2363280,like open section and actually i think  it looks quite nice with this little  crop top this is from i think gilly  hicks um but if you could get away with
001Gqw3BTpQ,2363280,2368320,being braless then even better such a  nice open back especially if you've got
001Gqw3BTpQ,2368320,2373599,your hair tied up sunglasses on perfect  for a really warm summer's day
001Gqw3BTpQ,2373599,2380000,okay  next i have got on this gorgeous dress  from holland cooper it's a kind of
001Gqw3BTpQ,2380000,2385520,knitted fabric it is so comfortable and  i have to be honest normally i steer
001Gqw3BTpQ,2385520,2391200,away from dresses like this because i  don't feel like i've got the perfect  body and sometimes i feel like dresses
001Gqw3BTpQ,2391200,2397839,like this are very  body focused um but  i've started to care quite a lot less
001Gqw3BTpQ,2397839,2403839,about that kind of thing and actually  it's comfortable and i really like how  this dress looks on me it is a little
001Gqw3BTpQ,2403839,2409280,bit finger hugging but i have to say i'm  wearing the least flattering underwear  in the entire world and yet the dress
001Gqw3BTpQ,2409280,2414960,still looks great  um i have gone braless you could  probably go with a strappy bra or you
001Gqw3BTpQ,2414960,2420400,know what actually you could probably  wear any bra because it's got it has got  these um
001Gqw3BTpQ,2420400,2425680,straps which have got the iconic  holland cooper little buttons on them
001Gqw3BTpQ,2425680,2432960,nice little low v-neck and then it is  quite flattering  on the bottom and i definitely would
001Gqw3BTpQ,2432960,2439520,wear better underwear if i was gonna  wear this or when i wear this out the  house a really nice one for summer days
001Gqw3BTpQ,2439520,2446160,again it could be a really nice work  dress work to bar that kind of vibe i  think i need to wear more figure hugging
001Gqw3BTpQ,2446160,2451839,things i tend to go for floaty fabrics  but this has made me realize that i  definitely need to definitely need to
001Gqw3BTpQ,2451839,2458480,branch out and wear things which are a  little bit more  yeah  it's okay to show the figure of your
001Gqw3BTpQ,2458480,2465359,body and i definitely  never do that so maybe this dress is the  nudge that i need to start i'm going to
001Gqw3BTpQ,2465359,2471119,finish with two more dresses from  principals at devenums i love a halter
001Gqw3BTpQ,2471119,2477119,neck for a summer holiday dress and i  was really drawn to the pattern on this  one i think it's a really fun it's not
001Gqw3BTpQ,2477119,2483920,too in your face and yet it still feels  like a fun and colorful choice it  doesn't come with the belts but i have
001Gqw3BTpQ,2483920,2490000,added my favorite my raffia belt i think  the ruffle around the collar is so  pretty it's got just a simple little um
001Gqw3BTpQ,2490000,2496640,button to do you up at the back there i  think the silhouette is really lovely  again for like a beach wedding or just
001Gqw3BTpQ,2496640,2504319,you know when you go out in the evenings  on a holiday and you want to feel  fabulous but equally  a dinner in a restaurant in london
001Gqw3BTpQ,2504319,2509920,i think equally perfect for those kinds  of occasions it is quite long i am quite
001Gqw3BTpQ,2509920,2516079,short um so i will have to take this up  a couple of inches i think this could  also look really nice with the white bow
001Gqw3BTpQ,2516079,2521920,belt but for ease and the fact that the  bow belt really does need ironing i  thought i would try it on with this one
001Gqw3BTpQ,2521920,2530319,oh my gosh it's so bright  i need my hat again  the hat is really growing on me
001Gqw3BTpQ,2531599,2536960,this feels like a kind of a beach  festival look
001Gqw3BTpQ,2536960,2543359,beach festival that would be fun  and the final item that i'm going to  share with you is yet another dress from
001Gqw3BTpQ,2543359,2548560,the principles from devonahms it's a  really easy to add sundress i find  things like this perfect for those
001Gqw3BTpQ,2548560,2555200,heatwave days really easy to just kind  of drop the shoulders catch the sun on  your chest on your neck
001Gqw3BTpQ,2555200,2562079,speaking of which um and just a really  nice simple silhouette really really  easy to throw on perfect for gardening
001Gqw3BTpQ,2562079,2567200,in fact i might stay in this and garden  in this outfit for the rest of the
001Gqw3BTpQ,2567200,2572480,afternoon  i did also throw a couple of cardigans
001Gqw3BTpQ,2572480,2577760,three actually one in  the same cardigan in three different  colors i probably will only keep one
001Gqw3BTpQ,2577760,2583760,probably the white one but sometimes you  just want something over your shoulders  just something nice and cozy at the end
001Gqw3BTpQ,2583760,2589280,of the day when the sun starts to go  down and i thought these are a really  nice relaxed kind of fit i've got the
001Gqw3BTpQ,2589280,2596160,white one downstairs so you'll have to  imagine that but this one is in this  minty green color possibly not
001Gqw3BTpQ,2596160,2601599,the best color combination but i wasn't  too sure on what shade of green it would  be from the website so i thought i would
001Gqw3BTpQ,2601599,2606800,try it  and then also in this baby pink um i
001Gqw3BTpQ,2606800,2612560,have already worn the white ones so i  have a feeling i'll probably  return these ones
001Gqw3BTpQ,2612560,2618160,um but i thought i would show you these  anyway  really nice for just taking that
001Gqw3BTpQ,2618160,2623680,end of a summer day chill off and  perfect for wearing over the top of your  favorite
001Gqw3BTpQ,2623680,2628800,summer dress  um but i've shown you quite a few  outfits now so i feel like this vlog
001Gqw3BTpQ,2628800,2634400,could probably be getting quite long so  gosh the lighting is changing like crazy  i think i'm going to end the vlog here
001Gqw3BTpQ,2634400,2640480,at darlings and probably start up the  next one to be honest because it is a  lovely day today i've got a few more
001Gqw3BTpQ,2640480,2646319,things downstairs i want to unbox but  yeah i think this one is getting too  long so i'm going to wrap up here before
