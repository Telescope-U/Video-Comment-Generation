FUBHyTM3VEg,130,2810,"- Hey, I'm Meredith Danberg-Ficarelli."
FUBHyTM3VEg,2810,5450,I'm a waste expert and garbage nerd.
FUBHyTM3VEg,5450,8219,Today I'll be answering your questions from Twitter.
FUBHyTM3VEg,8220,10048,"This is ""Waste Support""."
FUBHyTM3VEg,10048,12715,[upbeat music]
FUBHyTM3VEg,14190,15509,"Alright, first up,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,15510,19840,"Goldperil asks, WTF is zero waste, brah?"
FUBHyTM3VEg,19840,24250,Zero is an approach to resource conservation
FUBHyTM3VEg,24250,27369,that recognizes every step of the supply chain.
FUBHyTM3VEg,27370,29420,"Everything is made of something,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,29420,31730,and the point in a zero waste approach
FUBHyTM3VEg,31730,34350,"is that there is no burning,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,34350,37070,"so no incineration, and no discharge,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,37070,39130,"so that includes no landfilling,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,39130,41540,"no materials ending up in the ocean,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,41540,43995,and no particulate matter
FUBHyTM3VEg,43995,46719,or any other impacts from disposal ending up in the air.
FUBHyTM3VEg,46720,47700,"The term, zero waste,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,47700,50760,comes from the Zero Waste International Alliance
FUBHyTM3VEg,50760,52269,"We, as waste experts,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,52270,55090,"garbage nerds, recognize that we need to restructure"
FUBHyTM3VEg,55090,57000,the entire economy in order to get there.
FUBHyTM3VEg,57000,58040,But we're working on it.
FUBHyTM3VEg,58040,60260,"From Daniwanifofanny,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,60260,63500,why are landfills/dumps still a thing?
FUBHyTM3VEg,63500,65120,Shouldn't we be able to just launch
FUBHyTM3VEg,65120,67400,all our shit into space now?
FUBHyTM3VEg,67400,69030,Have you ever seen a rocket launch?
FUBHyTM3VEg,69030,70700,"There's like fire underneath it,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,70700,74289,'cause it takes a lot of energy to shoot things into space.
FUBHyTM3VEg,74290,76790,It would be really ill advised
FUBHyTM3VEg,76790,80070,"to waste energy to shoot our waste into space,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,80070,82490,when everything's made of something potentially valuable.
FUBHyTM3VEg,82490,84600,"So this is a bad idea, don't do this."
FUBHyTM3VEg,84600,86030,"Lelemonhead,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,86030,89180,why don't we use volcanoes as waste incinerators?
FUBHyTM3VEg,89180,91130,The Zero Waste International Alliance says
FUBHyTM3VEg,91130,94710,that we can't use burning to dispose of material.
FUBHyTM3VEg,94710,95979,Volcanoes would burn stuff.
FUBHyTM3VEg,95980,98620,"If we're making something to be able to use it,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,98620,100690,"to be able to just get rid of it by burning it,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,100690,103280,you're disrespecting all of that value
FUBHyTM3VEg,103280,105890,"that went into the thing, that includes the human labor,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,105890,108360,it includes all of the natural resources
FUBHyTM3VEg,108360,110200,"and everything else, the time,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,110200,111700,that went into making the thing.
FUBHyTM3VEg,111700,114369,"We wanna be able to use that value over,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,114370,115590,"and over, and over again."
FUBHyTM3VEg,115590,118149,Another reason is that burning waste
FUBHyTM3VEg,118150,121300,in incineration facilities can be incredibly dangerous.
FUBHyTM3VEg,121300,124050,"Harmful toxins, referred to as dioxins,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,124050,126210,and lots of other potential chemicals
FUBHyTM3VEg,126210,127880,"can be released into the atmosphere,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,127880,130399,and the communities that live around
FUBHyTM3VEg,130399,132569,those incineration facilities
FUBHyTM3VEg,132570,135080,"can end up with higher levels of cancer,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,135080,136340,higher levels of asthma.
FUBHyTM3VEg,136340,139900,"So aside from this recognition that materials have value,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,139900,141049,we don't wanna burn things
FUBHyTM3VEg,141050,144640,because it ends up endangering the lives of people
FUBHyTM3VEg,144640,147997,and everything else that's alive on the planet.
FUBHyTM3VEg,147997,151349,"Yesbutwhytho says, does recycling matter?"
FUBHyTM3VEg,151350,152310,Tell me it does.
FUBHyTM3VEg,152310,153550,Recycling totally matters.
FUBHyTM3VEg,153550,156340,"Everything is made from something, and so by recycling"
FUBHyTM3VEg,156340,158510,and by participating in a recycling economy
FUBHyTM3VEg,158510,162830,"we are respecting all of the nutrients, all of the labor,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,162830,165780,all of the emissions that went into producing
FUBHyTM3VEg,165780,167370,those things that we hold.
FUBHyTM3VEg,167370,170200,"And in order to make a new thing,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,170200,173709,"if we use a can as an example, we have to use many,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,173710,175560,"many, many more resources to make"
FUBHyTM3VEg,175560,179120,"a brand new can out of brand new, virgin materials"
FUBHyTM3VEg,179120,181580,"than if we're taking a can that already exists,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,181580,183440,"sending it through a recycling system,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,183440,185110,and making a new can out of it.
FUBHyTM3VEg,185110,187320,And the main thing that we really need to do
FUBHyTM3VEg,187320,189470,as part of building a circular economy
FUBHyTM3VEg,189470,193040,and moving towards zero waste is to increase access
FUBHyTM3VEg,193040,195480,"to the ability for people to recycle things,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,195480,197739,improve infrastructure to make it easier
FUBHyTM3VEg,197740,199390,"and more afford to recycle things,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,199390,202110,and hopefully reduce the travel distance
FUBHyTM3VEg,202110,203490,that we need to send things
FUBHyTM3VEg,203490,205060,in order for them to get recycled.
FUBHyTM3VEg,205060,207000,And also to recognize that some things probably
FUBHyTM3VEg,207000,208300,just shouldn't be made.
FUBHyTM3VEg,208300,212010,"Britnianise says, why is it so hard to recycle?"
FUBHyTM3VEg,212010,214750,You are 20 and can't put a plastic bottle
FUBHyTM3VEg,214750,217210,"in a separate bag from the regular trash,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,217210,218450,"make it make sense,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,218450,220860,or putting regular trash in the recycle.
FUBHyTM3VEg,220860,223140,"You're not alone, recycling is confusing,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,223140,224080,and it's not your fault.
FUBHyTM3VEg,224080,227950,"So I've actually got a couple bins here,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,227950,229980,"a trash bin with a clear bag,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,229980,231569,recycling bin with a black bag.
FUBHyTM3VEg,231570,233330,So this is one of my favorites.
FUBHyTM3VEg,233330,235840,"We have four different material types here,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,235840,237810,we've got a wooden stir stick
FUBHyTM3VEg,237810,240380,"that should be put in the compost, ideally,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,240380,242520,anything that was once alive can be composted.
FUBHyTM3VEg,242520,243950,The lid is plastic.
FUBHyTM3VEg,243950,246050,It's a number six.
FUBHyTM3VEg,246050,248720,The little triangle that's on plastics
FUBHyTM3VEg,248720,249870,"that has a number in it,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,249870,252690,that number is a resin identification code.
FUBHyTM3VEg,252690,254830,So six is a polystyrene plastic.
FUBHyTM3VEg,254830,256040,"Depending on where you are,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,256040,259109,different numbers of those recycling codes might be accepted
FUBHyTM3VEg,259109,261209,or might not be accepted in your recycling program.
FUBHyTM3VEg,261209,263259,"This like brown part here is paper,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,263260,265170,so it should go into the paper recycling.
FUBHyTM3VEg,265170,267250,"And then the cup is made of paper,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,267250,269830,but it has a plastic lining to make it water tight.
FUBHyTM3VEg,269830,271740,That plastic lining makes this cup really hard
FUBHyTM3VEg,271740,273819,to recycle in most recycling programs.
FUBHyTM3VEg,273820,275540,So the cup actually belongs in the trash.
FUBHyTM3VEg,275540,277490,"This cup also actually says,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,277490,282300,this cup is made with 10% post-consumer recycled fiber.
FUBHyTM3VEg,282300,283370,That's awesome
FUBHyTM3VEg,283370,286650,because post-consumer recycled content supports
FUBHyTM3VEg,286650,289470,a recycling economy by making products
FUBHyTM3VEg,289470,291520,out of recovered materials.
FUBHyTM3VEg,291520,293250,"In waste and in waste lingo,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,293250,295010,and when I'm educating people about waste
FUBHyTM3VEg,295010,297630,"I talk about materials literacy,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,297630,300810,which is the idea of recognizing
FUBHyTM3VEg,300810,303030,what the thing you're holding is made of.
FUBHyTM3VEg,303030,306060,"So if we use this glass jar as an example,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,306060,307660,"glass, metal."
FUBHyTM3VEg,307660,309700,So two material types.
FUBHyTM3VEg,309700,312180,"In New York City, the waste stream"
FUBHyTM3VEg,312180,313190,that I would put this into
FUBHyTM3VEg,313190,316480,"is a glass, metal, plastic waste stream."
FUBHyTM3VEg,316480,318780,"So even though these are different materials,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,318780,321800,they actually end up in the same place in New York City.
FUBHyTM3VEg,321800,323590,"Waste streams are different,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,323590,326610,"depending on where you are, because recycling is municipal."
FUBHyTM3VEg,326610,328669,One thing to think about is don't put anything
FUBHyTM3VEg,328670,330860,that's soiled with food in the recycling.
FUBHyTM3VEg,330860,332349,"And then take baby steps,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,332350,334060,"as you're working towards zero waste,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,334060,336620,"you're not gonna learn at all in the day, and that's okay."
FUBHyTM3VEg,336620,341090,"So Maxblacksails says, question of the day,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,341090,343510,just how does compost work?
FUBHyTM3VEg,343510,344680,I love this question.
FUBHyTM3VEg,344680,348000,Composting is the recycling of organic matter
FUBHyTM3VEg,348000,349540,in a controlled environment.
FUBHyTM3VEg,349540,353910,"So you're taking food scraps and yard waste,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,353910,358140,"and mixing them together with air over time,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,358140,359410,and you're making compost.
FUBHyTM3VEg,359410,361680,"You don't always have to have food scraps in compost,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,361680,363610,"it can also just be yard waste,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,363610,365849,"but the point is that it's organic matter,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,365850,367520,and I've got some samples here.
FUBHyTM3VEg,367520,370389,"So this is a jar, and you can see that this stuff"
FUBHyTM3VEg,370390,372273,is like moving pretty freely.
FUBHyTM3VEg,373270,376110,"It smells pretty neutral, smells like earth."
FUBHyTM3VEg,376110,378710,I'm looking in here and I can see like
FUBHyTM3VEg,378710,381289,"a little bit of kind of woody material,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,381290,384030,because my brother's a woodworker
FUBHyTM3VEg,384030,386280,and he brings his wood shavings home.
FUBHyTM3VEg,386280,388450,"So this is my carbon source,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,388450,392260,and my greens or my nitrogen source are my food scraps.
FUBHyTM3VEg,392260,393900,There are micro and macro organisms
FUBHyTM3VEg,393900,395520,that are eating the stuff
FUBHyTM3VEg,395520,397539,that I'm mixing together over time.
FUBHyTM3VEg,397540,399970,"And just like we, as people,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,399970,401750,"exhale carbon dioxide,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,401750,404530,so do the microorganisms that are making compost work.
FUBHyTM3VEg,404530,407510,"Over time, those microorganisms generate heat,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,407510,410290,and we have a compost thermometer here.
FUBHyTM3VEg,410290,412940,"This is like a laughably large thermometer,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,412940,415680,"you would not need one this big for a backyard compost bin,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,415680,418039,"but I'm a compost nerd, so I got the big one."
FUBHyTM3VEg,418040,420980,This is used to measure the temperature
FUBHyTM3VEg,420980,423570,of the compost because as those micro
FUBHyTM3VEg,423570,426020,"and macro organisms are eating the food scraps,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,426020,428460,they're creating a parabolic temperature curve.
FUBHyTM3VEg,428460,430080,So the temperature starts low
FUBHyTM3VEg,430080,431409,"and then it starts to increase,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,431410,434600,and at the peak you're reaching what compost people
FUBHyTM3VEg,434600,439600,"call PFRP, or the Process To Further Reduce Pathogens."
FUBHyTM3VEg,439770,442740,"So anything that we discard that was once you know,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,442740,446250,"alive, whether it's food that might have salmonella,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,446250,448730,"or E. coli, potentially harmful bacteria"
FUBHyTM3VEg,448730,451510,"or even plant pathogens or other pathogens,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,451510,453000,part of composting is actually
FUBHyTM3VEg,453000,455740,like sanitizing the organic matter.
FUBHyTM3VEg,455740,458910,And so we measure temperature so that we can make sure
FUBHyTM3VEg,458910,461800,"that we are reaching this PFRP,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,461800,465720,131 degrees Fahrenheit or 55 degrees Celsius
FUBHyTM3VEg,465720,469300,"for a minimum of 3 days or up to 15 days,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,469300,471340,depending on the type of composting that you're doing.
FUBHyTM3VEg,471340,473230,"And then this last example,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,473230,474560,"this is a way more recent sample,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,474560,476800,I pulled this out just the other day.
FUBHyTM3VEg,476800,478560,You can see it's a lot more wet.
FUBHyTM3VEg,478560,480300,When you're compost has been in the bin for a while
FUBHyTM3VEg,480300,481330,or when it's kind of nearing
FUBHyTM3VEg,481330,483530,"the end of the that parabolic temperature curve,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,483530,484830,"nearing the end of its cycle,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,484830,488169,it should be the consistency of a rung out sponge.
FUBHyTM3VEg,488170,489620,"So like if you squeeze it,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,489620,491030,there shouldn't be drops of water.
FUBHyTM3VEg,491030,493370,"I'm pretty sure if I squeezed this, some water would fall."
FUBHyTM3VEg,493370,495610,"But this jar has been closed for a bit,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,495610,498520,"and one of the tests is if you smell it,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,498520,500789,"and it smells like ammonia, it's not ready yet."
FUBHyTM3VEg,500790,501630,This smells lovely.
FUBHyTM3VEg,501630,504120,"So my compost is fine, it's just a little wet."
FUBHyTM3VEg,504120,506850,So I would wanna add more carbon through the process
FUBHyTM3VEg,506850,509110,so that it can absorb some of that moisture.
FUBHyTM3VEg,509110,512500,"Compost is magic, and by participating in composting"
FUBHyTM3VEg,512500,515630,you are also participating in making magic.
FUBHyTM3VEg,515630,519320,"Miskeendee says, people who swim in Lake Ontario"
FUBHyTM3VEg,519320,521659,will grow a third eye and an extra limb.
FUBHyTM3VEg,521659,525290,I do wonder what body of work this person is citing here.
FUBHyTM3VEg,525290,527240,It can certainly be dangerous to swim
FUBHyTM3VEg,527240,529250,in polluted water bodies.
FUBHyTM3VEg,529250,530810,Bodies of water can be polluted
FUBHyTM3VEg,530810,532200,by a lot of different things.
FUBHyTM3VEg,532200,533170,"In New York city,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,533170,535399,one of the most common sources of pollution
FUBHyTM3VEg,535400,537220,"for our water is sewage,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,537220,540310,"because of combined sewage overflow,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,540310,542210,which has to do with the way
FUBHyTM3VEg,542210,544420,that our wastewater infrastructure
FUBHyTM3VEg,544420,547190,was built hundreds of years ago for a city
FUBHyTM3VEg,547190,548910,with far fewer people in it.
FUBHyTM3VEg,548910,552269,Now that wastewater infrastructure doesn't have the capacity
FUBHyTM3VEg,552270,554710,for the amount of water that we're sending through it.
FUBHyTM3VEg,554710,557220,"And so anytime it rains, out of,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,557220,560930,"I think it's more than 240 combined sewage overflow points,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,560930,563730,raw sewage just spills into New York City's waterways.
FUBHyTM3VEg,563730,568680,"Bf99Floyd asks, does biodegradable mean the remains"
FUBHyTM3VEg,568680,569980,are earth friendly?
FUBHyTM3VEg,569980,572040,"Bev, this is a super good question."
FUBHyTM3VEg,572040,573220,Short answer is no.
FUBHyTM3VEg,573220,575420,Biodegradable does not automatically
FUBHyTM3VEg,575420,576950,mean something is earth friendly.
FUBHyTM3VEg,576950,580380,"An orange peel is biodegradable, but you might also get"
FUBHyTM3VEg,580380,583760,like a piece of packaging that says that it's biodegradable.
FUBHyTM3VEg,583760,586730,That could just mean that that piece of packaging
FUBHyTM3VEg,586730,590899,is made of some combination of plant-based materials
FUBHyTM3VEg,590900,592950,"and non plant-based, like plastic,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,592950,594290,"fossil fuel based materials,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,594290,596610,and that over time it might break down
FUBHyTM3VEg,596610,598550,"so that you can't see it anymore,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,598550,600810,"but the plastic kind of polymers,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,600810,603950,the bonds that are in there at a microscopic level
FUBHyTM3VEg,603950,606180,will just contaminate the soil as microplastics
FUBHyTM3VEg,606180,609240,and be there on a human time scale forever.
FUBHyTM3VEg,609240,612850,So what you wanna look for is certified compostable.
FUBHyTM3VEg,612850,615850,That's the language that we're looking for when it comes
FUBHyTM3VEg,615850,619190,to packaging and knowing whether or not it can be composted.
FUBHyTM3VEg,619190,624190,"Pikesley says, WTF does this mean @BBCNews?"
FUBHyTM3VEg,624380,628120,"Is a ""microplastic"" a unit of measurement now?"
FUBHyTM3VEg,628120,629890,Scientists have estimated
FUBHyTM3VEg,629890,634330,"that 94,000 microplastics per second flow down the river."
FUBHyTM3VEg,634330,639210,Microplastic is a term that refers to plastics
FUBHyTM3VEg,639210,642210,that are less than five millimeters in size.
FUBHyTM3VEg,642210,645250,When plastic is in the environment or really anywhere
FUBHyTM3VEg,645250,647920,"and comes in contact with UV rays,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,647920,649930,the plastic starts to degrade.
FUBHyTM3VEg,649930,651649,"It ends up like flaking,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,651650,653750,like turning into smaller and smaller pieces.
FUBHyTM3VEg,653750,655670,There's microplastic everywhere.
FUBHyTM3VEg,655670,656970,"Honestly, our clothes,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,656970,660300,"unless they're made of 100% natural fibers like silk,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,660300,661660,"or wool, or cotton,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,661660,665000,they are producing microplastics like whenever you move.
FUBHyTM3VEg,665000,667460,One of the solutions is to reuse things
FUBHyTM3VEg,667460,668530,that aren't made of plastic
FUBHyTM3VEg,668530,670510,because plastic degrades over time.
FUBHyTM3VEg,670510,672970,We do need to work systemically
FUBHyTM3VEg,672970,675089,to make it so that it's easier for people
FUBHyTM3VEg,675090,678720,to not do things that produce microplastics.
FUBHyTM3VEg,678720,682519,"YallaWael says, where will the trash go"
FUBHyTM3VEg,682520,684300,when all the landfills are full?
FUBHyTM3VEg,684300,687350,"If we continue with the way things are going now,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,687350,690240,which is that a lot of very large companies
FUBHyTM3VEg,690240,693490,"are buying up land and building more landfills,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,693490,696490,and charging a lot of money to be able to collect waste.
FUBHyTM3VEg,696490,697720,"When the landfills are full,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,697720,699310,"if we can continue on this trend,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,699310,700810,"we'll just have more landfills,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,700810,702800,and eventually the whole world will be a landfill.
FUBHyTM3VEg,702800,704240,Won't that be fun?
FUBHyTM3VEg,704240,705529,"Kevinkrejci,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,705530,709330,how can Amazon do a better job of packing shipments?
FUBHyTM3VEg,709330,711700,So one of the things that Amazon can do
FUBHyTM3VEg,711700,715250,"is certainly improve the amount of space that they're using,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,715250,718390,maybe resize some of their packaging to be more efficient.
FUBHyTM3VEg,718390,722670,I would love if every packaging item that Amazon used
FUBHyTM3VEg,722670,725120,was made of 100% post-consumer recycled content.
FUBHyTM3VEg,725120,727529,"That would be huge because it would mean that Amazon,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,727530,730970,this massive behemoth who has incredible purchasing power
FUBHyTM3VEg,730970,734769,would be demanding from the global recycling economy
FUBHyTM3VEg,734770,738980,an incredible amount of recovered material.
FUBHyTM3VEg,738980,740300,"So like bales, and bales,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,740300,743680,"and bales of recovered cardboard, recovered plastic."
FUBHyTM3VEg,743680,747010,"If we could like just start there, that would be awesome."
FUBHyTM3VEg,747010,749550,I actually brought a prop along that's perfect for this.
FUBHyTM3VEg,749550,750383,"Zip, zip."
FUBHyTM3VEg,750383,751230,This is a zippy pouch
FUBHyTM3VEg,751230,754070,that I made out of Amazon Fresh packaging.
FUBHyTM3VEg,754070,758550,"And actually, the liner is made of those air pack thingies."
FUBHyTM3VEg,758550,761399,"This is from TamarHaspel,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,761400,764420,how do I responsibly dispose of my ridiculous collection
FUBHyTM3VEg,764420,766529,of defunct/obsolete electronics?
FUBHyTM3VEg,766530,768700,"Good job hoarding, and I'm glad that you"
FUBHyTM3VEg,768700,770710,didn't put these right in your waste bin.
FUBHyTM3VEg,770710,772100,"This is gonna depend on where you live,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,772100,774269,so you should look where you live
FUBHyTM3VEg,774270,776350,and then electronics recycling.
FUBHyTM3VEg,776350,778980,Some places will have electronics recycling drop offs
FUBHyTM3VEg,778980,780740,or depots where you can bring these things.
FUBHyTM3VEg,780740,782050,Sometimes it's an event
FUBHyTM3VEg,782050,784830,that's hosted maybe quarterly or maybe annually
FUBHyTM3VEg,784830,787200,that is also for hazardous materials.
FUBHyTM3VEg,787200,789050,Sometimes municipalities and organizations
FUBHyTM3VEg,789050,790680,will like lump those things together
FUBHyTM3VEg,790680,792060,to make it easier for people.
FUBHyTM3VEg,792060,793060,"For some of these things,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,793060,796540,you might be able to look whether a local big box store
FUBHyTM3VEg,796540,798519,or or store that sells electronics
FUBHyTM3VEg,798520,800640,might accept some of these things.
FUBHyTM3VEg,800640,803774,"Recognize also, lithium-ion batteries can be dangerous"
FUBHyTM3VEg,803774,805890,and can spontaneously combust
FUBHyTM3VEg,805890,807230,if they're not stored correctly.
FUBHyTM3VEg,807230,809779,So everyone should kind of like check
FUBHyTM3VEg,809780,812490,the random drawer that has their random electronics in it.
FUBHyTM3VEg,812490,814709,Remove the batteries and get those recycled.
FUBHyTM3VEg,814710,817410,"If you're gonna kind of hold on the rest of the stuff,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,817410,819800,'cause you don't wanna catch things on fire.
FUBHyTM3VEg,819800,821580,"BeppiWap says,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,821580,824920,what's the proper way to recycle Nickelodeon slime?
FUBHyTM3VEg,824920,827600,"I have no idea what Nickelodeon slime is made of,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,827600,829069,"maybe flushing it down down the toilet,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,829070,830700,assuming that it's food safe.
FUBHyTM3VEg,830700,832340,"Just don't put it in your recycling bin,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,832340,833330,it doesn't belong there.
FUBHyTM3VEg,833330,836120,So when is flushing something down the toilet appropriate?
FUBHyTM3VEg,836120,838570,If I have made food
FUBHyTM3VEg,838570,840430,"and forgot about it in the fridge,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,840430,842390,flushing it down the toilet's a pretty good option
FUBHyTM3VEg,842390,844230,if you don't have access to composting.
FUBHyTM3VEg,844230,845720,"I put an asterisk there 'cause,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,845720,847740,"you know, you don't wanna flush like a loaf of bread"
FUBHyTM3VEg,847740,848990,"down the toilet, bad idea."
FUBHyTM3VEg,848990,851060,"But if it's chili, for example,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,851060,852600,it's probably okay.
FUBHyTM3VEg,852600,854519,"Infrastructure is local,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,854520,856520,"so depending on where you are,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,856520,859040,your wastewater infrastructure might not
FUBHyTM3VEg,859040,861449,be able to handle the additional input.
FUBHyTM3VEg,861450,863680,So I'm not suggesting that everyone go
FUBHyTM3VEg,863680,865560,"and flush all their food scraps down the toilet,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,865560,867090,that's not the thing to do.
FUBHyTM3VEg,867090,870140,Use the websites of your municipal entities.
FUBHyTM3VEg,870140,871990,It is gonna be different depending on where you are.
FUBHyTM3VEg,871990,875170,"Daniwal16 says, I really, really,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,875170,877209,really wanna start over cycling program at work
FUBHyTM3VEg,877210,878880,but I've no idea where to start.
FUBHyTM3VEg,878880,881930,"Generally buildings have waste collection,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,881930,884270,so that's the first step is figuring out
FUBHyTM3VEg,884270,886800,"who's picking up the waste from where you are,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,886800,889760,"making sure that you have bins to collect the recycling in,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,889760,892710,of course understanding what should go into those bins.
FUBHyTM3VEg,892710,895330,So that might be looking at your municipalities website
FUBHyTM3VEg,895330,897490,or talking to your property manager.
FUBHyTM3VEg,897490,900600,"Ideally getting some signage and doing some education,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,900600,903399,"so teaching everyone else how to participate,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,903400,905160,those are some of the foundational steps.
FUBHyTM3VEg,905160,906810,"Alright, that's it,"
FUBHyTM3VEg,906810,908080,that's all the questions.
FUBHyTM3VEg,908080,910210,I hope you learned something.
FUBHyTM3VEg,910210,911842,Till next time.
