zYjTsQNxDq8,100960,106880,just shows videos of people who create  spy cameras out of animals
zYjTsQNxDq8,106880,112720,and  what yeah so like  spy cameras made to look like animals i
zYjTsQNxDq8,112720,118560,should say so there will be like a  badger um that looks very convincingly
zYjTsQNxDq8,118560,124479,like a badger um  maybe not a badger or an odd or  something like that um but
zYjTsQNxDq8,124479,130560,its eye is a camera and it like  infiltrates  the the little otter nests and is
zYjTsQNxDq8,130560,136160,accepted as one of their own because  they can't quite tell the difference  um and you're just not moving at all and
zYjTsQNxDq8,136160,143200,it is moving oh yeah it moves around  it's like remote controlled it's it's  pretty convincing and makes you wonder
zYjTsQNxDq8,143200,148800,what actual like governmental spy  technology there is out there  um
zYjTsQNxDq8,148800,156379,the birds aren't real  um  [Music]

zYjTsQNxDq8,199440,204720,yeah it's not to like spy on the animals  as in like  [ __ ] get dirt on their credit history
zYjTsQNxDq8,204720,210799,it's just  just try to learn about them yeah  badgers are notoriously bad at their

zYjTsQNxDq8,838959,844160,they did sky sanctuary and they did the  sky sanctuary
zYjTsQNxDq8,844240,850959,um  but now this is a 3d sonic level  and i'm playing it as 2d sonic
zYjTsQNxDq8,850959,857600,i dare say  we've been playing sonic games in  reverse order of how
zYjTsQNxDq8,857600,863680,good they seem to be  do you know what i mean  uh  like we
zYjTsQNxDq8,863680,869360,started with sonic boom which was  by all accounts a [ __ ] disaster
zYjTsQNxDq8,869360,874399,except in the entertainment way in which  case it was a masterpiece is that the  first sonic we will play that you and i
zYjTsQNxDq8,874399,880639,played yeah i think so  what  i mean it was pretty early on it was  2014. that was the year after i joined
zYjTsQNxDq8,880639,887040,the show  holy [ __ ] yeah man eight years ago
zYjTsQNxDq8,889199,894800,[ __ ]  yeah man i wish there was another game  like sonic  uh it's like boom
zYjTsQNxDq8,894800,901680,just just just abhorrent  although sonic frontiers is going to  suck ass so really
zYjTsQNxDq8,901680,910160,oh yeah i'm so excited oh but yeah  that's what i was trying to say like  sonic boom was bad sonic unleashed was
zYjTsQNxDq8,910160,916079,bad but still better than sonic boom  um  in between them we played sonic in the
zYjTsQNxDq8,916079,921120,black knight which was ridiculous  um
zYjTsQNxDq8,921199,927839,then  uh  that classic arcade sonic which i  thought was pretty great
zYjTsQNxDq8,927839,933680,then uh  yeah  sonic mania was that it oh yeah yeah
zYjTsQNxDq8,933680,941120,that was probably the best of all i  thought that was pretty great and then  colors i really enjoyed and this i think  is is really good
zYjTsQNxDq8,941120,946320,well you're not playing it oh well it's  true  i'm just it's just the eye test it's
zYjTsQNxDq8,946320,952880,just the eye test  they made the offices nice little  parking garage  good attention to detail
zYjTsQNxDq8,952880,958880,it's a delightful setting yeah like the  backgrounds look crisp and clean
zYjTsQNxDq8,959040,965440,how do the cars get out of there there's  no room  they drive off the uh edge
zYjTsQNxDq8,965600,970720,it's uh not a good system yeah there's  literally nowhere to like pull out ah

zYjTsQNxDq8,1113039,1119200,dude after mr farts i'm convinced that  anything can succeed  if anyone doesn't know mr farts on
zYjTsQNxDq8,1119200,1125440,spotify  oh man  did we talk about it i don't remember we
zYjTsQNxDq8,1125440,1131679,did open an episode with it yeah because  we were playing farting around the house  where the female singer is like it's
zYjTsQNxDq8,1131679,1136440,going to get smelly in here
zYjTsQNxDq8,1146750,1153280,[Music]  my new favorite is meditation farts  whoops  which is their song where it's just like
zYjTsQNxDq8,1153280,1158640,one droney keyboard  chord with like
zYjTsQNxDq8,1158640,1164480,mixed in there have you ever 30 000  spotify monthly plays have you ever gone  to a meditation place
zYjTsQNxDq8,1164480,1169760,and they're playing that music  but for some reason like  it's just

zYjTsQNxDq8,1356000,1361520,helicopters  these helicopters are the best  like when you
zYjTsQNxDq8,1361520,1369519,swing your dick around yeah yeah dude  all right let's get back up there
zYjTsQNxDq8,1371679,1377360,do you actually feel like helicopters  are the best i would not be comfortable  on one at all what really yeah oh
zYjTsQNxDq8,1377360,1382480,they're so cool they're yeah they're  very cool like it's amazing
zYjTsQNxDq8,1382480,1388320,it's amazing that they can  wear blades around so fast that it will
zYjTsQNxDq8,1388320,1395200,lift you into the air  but uh  oh gotta tell you they freaked me out
zYjTsQNxDq8,1396559,1404159,yeah like if i was in a helicopter i  would just be constantly reminded how  death is above and below
zYjTsQNxDq8,1404159,1409360,oh yeah you're so right eh yeah yeah  that's such a [ __ ] pessimistic view
zYjTsQNxDq8,1409360,1416480,on helicopters well it's just a badass  thing  i don't want to die though it's it's
zYjTsQNxDq8,1416480,1422880,this thing i've been people are you  afraid of airplanes  no well yes of course but i've got to
zYjTsQNxDq8,1422880,1429279,get where i'm going oh really  yeah but i mean like  they they feel stable enough
zYjTsQNxDq8,1429279,1435360,that like  i mean no one likes turbulence  you've never been on that an airplane  where there's like
zYjTsQNxDq8,1435360,1440960,so much turbulence that like you start  to notice like the the flight attendants  like looking around
zYjTsQNxDq8,1440960,1447840,that's a shitty feeling  uh yeah but  the plane never goes down because of
zYjTsQNxDq8,1447840,1452960,turbulence no i know but  it's it's uncomfortable so i just
zYjTsQNxDq8,1452960,1458559,remember that always yeah it's like oh  if a plane like  starts to plummet because of turbulence
zYjTsQNxDq8,1458559,1465600,it's just going to get out of the  turbulence yeah  yeah  it'll break apart
zYjTsQNxDq8,1466000,1473440,and we're all dead yeah well i don't  know you had such a fear of flying  it's not a fear it's just you know
zYjTsQNxDq8,1473440,1478720,it's the uncomfortable that comes the  uncomfortableness that comes with  sitting in a chair in the sky
zYjTsQNxDq8,1478720,1484240,and you can't fly  it's the same reason i'm  freaked out by sharks because the
zYjTsQNxDq8,1484240,1489279,environment you're in is not what your  body was designed to do yeah but it's  epic though
zYjTsQNxDq8,1489279,1494400,getting eaten by a shark no  well  that is kind of epic in a way
zYjTsQNxDq8,1494400,1499520,but like  [ __ ] being in the air in a chair in  the sky you're like living like a king
zYjTsQNxDq8,1499520,1505919,dude  trust me you're [ __ ] you're like  you're like an angel within a chariot in
zYjTsQNxDq8,1505919,1512240,the sky i get that side of it too and  i've gone like parasailing you know like  i've done [ __ ] that i would not do now
zYjTsQNxDq8,1512240,1517440,um like parasailing is like wonderful  parasailing was wonderful really
zYjTsQNxDq8,1517440,1522880,relaxing um it seems like oh no we're  going up and then you're up there and  it's like peaceful and you're like it
zYjTsQNxDq8,1522880,1528240,was fabulous  except when i got home oh hold on let's  hear what she has to say
zYjTsQNxDq8,1528240,1533919,[Music]  i don't know
zYjTsQNxDq8,1533919,1539200,it was scarier it's cookies and cream  trying to be brave

zYjTsQNxDq8,1546400,1553200,back when i left  all right see ya  good luck with all that
zYjTsQNxDq8,1553200,1561039,um  yeah that was when i was an exchange  student  in in france that i went parasailing and
zYjTsQNxDq8,1561039,1567279,the  family i was staying with the dad was a  doctor  um like an emergency surgeon
zYjTsQNxDq8,1567279,1573279,and as soon as i  came home from parasailing he scolded me  in a very loving way he was an awesome
zYjTsQNxDq8,1573279,1580320,dude but he was just like  all i do  all day  is treat tourists who have broken their
zYjTsQNxDq8,1580320,1585520,legs landing while parasailing really  yeah yeah if you don't land correctly
zYjTsQNxDq8,1585520,1590960,it's it'll it'll [ __ ] you up  that's
zYjTsQNxDq8,1591279,1596400,i've never heard of that  i mean i guess that makes sense yeah  yeah i mean
zYjTsQNxDq8,1596400,1603120,it's not really newsworthy  like man hurt self  like that that just won't
zYjTsQNxDq8,1603120,1608480,that won't sell the articles once again  somebody hurt themselves
zYjTsQNxDq8,1608480,1613760,parasailing  yeah what a surprise they were going  slowly and gently
