4CYGnb__N28,10320,11599,what's going on everyone it's justin
4CYGnb__N28,11599,13040,here and today i've got a what's in my
4CYGnb__N28,13040,15679,travel bag video for 2022. so i'm in
4CYGnb__N28,15679,17199,barcelona spain right now in this
4CYGnb__N28,17199,19520,absolutely beautiful hotel and the funny
4CYGnb__N28,19520,21600,part of it is that the actual like
4CYGnb__N28,21600,23279,fixtures and everything look quite
4CYGnb__N28,23279,25519,similar to like my overall aesthetic and
4CYGnb__N28,25519,27760,similar to the home office set as well
4CYGnb__N28,27760,29359,so i figured i would film this video out
4CYGnb__N28,29359,30880,here because i just didn't have enough
4CYGnb__N28,30880,32960,time to film it before i left because
4CYGnb__N28,32960,35040,it's been a very very busy start to the
4CYGnb__N28,35040,36960,year but the best part is we're back on
4CYGnb__N28,36960,38719,the road and i'm in barcelona right now
4CYGnb__N28,38719,41920,for mobile world congress 2022 with oppo
4CYGnb__N28,41920,43040,to be able to check out the convention
4CYGnb__N28,43040,44559,for the very first time but also create
4CYGnb__N28,44559,47120,a travel film in barcelona featuring the
4CYGnb__N28,47120,49520,phone itself its camera capabilities and
4CYGnb__N28,49520,51360,just bring back that travel series as a
4CYGnb__N28,51360,54480,whole that you guys saw back in 2019 but
4CYGnb__N28,54480,56000,today we're here to talk about all the
4CYGnb__N28,56000,57760,things that i've brought on this trip
4CYGnb__N28,57760,60399,how my gear pack has changed and in fact
4CYGnb__N28,60399,62000,this is actually the lightest that i've
4CYGnb__N28,62000,63840,packed to date we're going to be going
4CYGnb__N28,63840,65439,over the tech side of things the camera
4CYGnb__N28,65439,66720,equipment maybe show you guys some of
4CYGnb__N28,66720,68479,the photos that i took on the leica in
4CYGnb__N28,68479,71360,the past week or so as well as showing
4CYGnb__N28,71360,73280,you some of the chargers and accessories
4CYGnb__N28,73280,75040,and little gadgets and hacks that i've
4CYGnb__N28,75040,77200,kind of put into my bag after traveling
4CYGnb__N28,77200,78960,a ton and on top of that i'm also going
4CYGnb__N28,78960,80400,to show you the toiletry items that i'm
4CYGnb__N28,80400,82159,using at the moment and maybe the
4CYGnb__N28,82159,83920,clothes that i brought as well so i'm
4CYGnb__N28,83920,85360,going to go into huge detail here and
4CYGnb__N28,85360,87119,the reason why i haven't made this video
4CYGnb__N28,87119,89439,in like literally two years is because
4CYGnb__N28,89439,91520,it just wouldn't have been realistic i
4CYGnb__N28,91520,94320,simply haven't traveled at all and so i
4CYGnb__N28,94320,96240,figured let's go ahead and show you guys
4CYGnb__N28,96240,98400,every single thing because some things
4CYGnb__N28,98400,100320,have stayed the same but others may have
4CYGnb__N28,100320,102399,changed and if you guys want to win an
4CYGnb__N28,102399,103920,item from this video just go ahead and

4CYGnb__N28,107280,108960,below with what you think is the most
4CYGnb__N28,108960,110960,effective travel accessory and i'll be
4CYGnb__N28,110960,112560,picking a winner in the comment section
4CYGnb__N28,112560,114280,in three weeks
4CYGnb__N28,114280,117040,[Music]
4CYGnb__N28,117040,118479,so starting with a backpack this right
4CYGnb__N28,118479,120320,here is a gucci canvas one that i picked
4CYGnb__N28,120320,123680,up in milan italy about two years ago it
4CYGnb__N28,123680,125119,was a lot cheaper than what it would
4CYGnb__N28,125119,127040,have been in north america and even
4CYGnb__N28,127040,128879,though it is still overpriced it is just
4CYGnb__N28,128879,131200,a nice canvas backpack that i think has
4CYGnb__N28,131200,133440,a good blend of practicality but also a
4CYGnb__N28,133440,135440,little bit of style to it and being
4CYGnb__N28,135440,138080,canvas it is very very durable it has
4CYGnb__N28,138080,139599,two different buckles right here and it
4CYGnb__N28,139599,140959,has like a bit of a drawstring that
4CYGnb__N28,140959,143120,allows me to just put my laptop my
4CYGnb__N28,143120,144959,tablet in and quickly access everything
4CYGnb__N28,144959,146400,that i need but i also like the places
4CYGnb__N28,146400,148239,that all the pockets are placed and
4CYGnb__N28,148239,149680,essentially how i've kind of mapped out
4CYGnb__N28,149680,151440,that bag is i have my laptop and my
4CYGnb__N28,151440,153360,tablet of course in the main compartment
4CYGnb__N28,153360,155760,i have my passport on the inside zipped
4CYGnb__N28,155760,157360,up because you don't want to lose that
4CYGnb__N28,157360,159120,and then on the grab and go side i have
4CYGnb__N28,159120,160640,like some charging cables and things
4CYGnb__N28,160640,162640,that i might need around the airport and
4CYGnb__N28,162640,164640,i also have like a pair of wireless
4CYGnb__N28,164640,166879,earbuds on the top because as you get on
4CYGnb__N28,166879,168720,the plane and put it underneath the seat
4CYGnb__N28,168720,170160,you're most likely gonna grab like your
4CYGnb__N28,170160,172640,ipad and your earbuds and so i feel like
4CYGnb__N28,172640,174720,this bag really does suit my overall
4CYGnb__N28,174720,177280,style and the practicality needs of what
4CYGnb__N28,177280,178959,i need to put inside of it depending on
4CYGnb__N28,178959,180400,where i am i might bring this backpack
4CYGnb__N28,180400,182480,out with me every single day but in this
4CYGnb__N28,182480,184400,trip for example where we are in a place
4CYGnb__N28,184400,186640,that is very crowded and theft does seem
4CYGnb__N28,186640,188560,to be an issue i've actually been able
4CYGnb__N28,188560,191120,to pack extremely minimally and not even
4CYGnb__N28,191120,193360,bring a wallet just a little bit of cash
4CYGnb__N28,193360,195599,and my phone and everything else is on
4CYGnb__N28,195599,197440,mobile and so i only have to really look
4CYGnb__N28,197440,199519,at one item and then i have my leica on
4CYGnb__N28,199519,201280,a strap and that everybody on the team
4CYGnb__N28,201280,203120,is keeping an eye out for each other
4CYGnb__N28,203120,204799,because depending on where you are you
4CYGnb__N28,204799,206720,may want to be conscious of that so i
4CYGnb__N28,206720,208080,know in the past rollback videos you
4CYGnb__N28,208080,209760,guys said like this is not a safe travel
4CYGnb__N28,209760,211519,pack but to be honest all the stuff
4CYGnb__N28,211519,214319,stays in the hotel and often in a safe
4CYGnb__N28,214319,215519,so when it comes like the laptop that
4CYGnb__N28,215519,217360,i'm using right now this is the macbook
4CYGnb__N28,217360,220319,pro 14 inch with the m1x processor as
4CYGnb__N28,220319,223519,well as 64 gigabytes of combined memory
4CYGnb__N28,223519,224799,it's been really really good to be
4CYGnb__N28,224799,226080,honest when i first got it i didn't
4CYGnb__N28,226080,227920,really use it that much because i work
4CYGnb__N28,227920,229519,at home every day i have my desktop and
4CYGnb__N28,229519,230799,all that kind of stuff and aside from
4CYGnb__N28,230799,232959,like some very light admin work and some
4CYGnb__N28,232959,234720,video editing i really wasn't putting
4CYGnb__N28,234720,237200,this laptop through its paces but after
4CYGnb__N28,237200,239360,having it for a week on the road i can
4CYGnb__N28,239360,240959,tell you that for the first time in a
4CYGnb__N28,240959,242720,while i feel like i can completely
4CYGnb__N28,242720,245040,replace my desktop workflow with a
4CYGnb__N28,245040,246959,laptop like this and even though i'm not
4CYGnb__N28,246959,248799,going to be switching to this because we
4CYGnb__N28,248799,250879,do have that large computer that i use
4CYGnb__N28,250879,252799,for all my daily work and video editing
4CYGnb__N28,252799,254879,in general i am very excited about the
4CYGnb__N28,254879,257280,future and apple's pro line of m1
4CYGnb__N28,257280,259199,computers that are hopefully going to be
4CYGnb__N28,259199,261280,available sometime this year so this
4CYGnb__N28,261280,263040,next item right here is the 11 inch m1
4CYGnb__N28,263040,264880,ipad i would say that it is very
4CYGnb__N28,264880,266720,unnecessary to bring an ipad and a
4CYGnb__N28,266720,268479,macbook on a given trip and in the past
4CYGnb__N28,268479,269919,i've actually traveled with only the
4CYGnb__N28,269919,271919,ipad and just left the macbook at home
4CYGnb__N28,271919,274000,especially on shorter trips where like
4CYGnb__N28,274000,275919,on-site video editing is not really
4CYGnb__N28,275919,278240,needed in this case because i had like
4CYGnb__N28,278240,280800,about 20 hours of flying watching movies
4CYGnb__N28,280800,283040,on an ipad is a lot easier i have the
4CYGnb__N28,283040,284720,netflix app i have the crave app
4CYGnb__N28,284720,286479,everything is downloaded on the ipad
4CYGnb__N28,286479,288479,itself it doesn't take up as much space
4CYGnb__N28,288479,289919,you can fold it up and all that kind of
4CYGnb__N28,289919,291600,stuff and even though you can do that
4CYGnb__N28,291600,293919,all on a laptop i just find because
4CYGnb__N28,293919,295600,there is a choice to use the ipad it is
4CYGnb__N28,295600,297600,a lot more practical and a lot of times
4CYGnb__N28,297600,299600,i also like to do some photo editing on
4CYGnb__N28,299600,301360,the tablet as well thanks to the apple
4CYGnb__N28,301360,302720,pencil so if i need to like do any
4CYGnb__N28,302720,304400,retouching in lightroom and stuff like
4CYGnb__N28,304400,306479,that then i can do that on the ipad and
4CYGnb__N28,306479,309120,i did also bring a usb type-c adapter
4CYGnb__N28,309120,310800,that has an sd card slot so i can just
4CYGnb__N28,310800,312639,put the sd card there and import the
4CYGnb__N28,312639,314560,photos straight to the tablet
4CYGnb__N28,314560,316000,so something else that i also love to
4CYGnb__N28,316000,318160,use my ipad for whether it's on the go
4CYGnb__N28,318160,320240,or at home in our typical day-to-day
4CYGnb__N28,320240,322160,workflow is evernote and i want to give
4CYGnb__N28,322160,323600,a huge thanks to them for sponsoring
4CYGnb__N28,323600,325360,this video those who don't know evernote
4CYGnb__N28,325360,327039,is a one-stop organization and
4CYGnb__N28,327039,328720,productivity system and the team at
4CYGnb__N28,328720,330880,feature media uses it to stay organized
4CYGnb__N28,330880,332880,and productive with all our notes and
4CYGnb__N28,332880,334560,to-do lists some of the notebooks that
4CYGnb__N28,334560,337280,we have include like video ideas videos
4CYGnb__N28,337280,339840,scripts and areas to highlight packing
4CYGnb__N28,339840,342080,lists and also like our airbnb business
4CYGnb__N28,342080,344000,while we try to put together the entire
4CYGnb__N28,344000,345600,welcome experience and also
4CYGnb__N28,345600,347680,brainstorming youtube series such as the
4CYGnb__N28,347680,349440,home series that's going to be coming up
4CYGnb__N28,349440,351440,very soon i can really start my day by
4CYGnb__N28,351440,352720,knowing what's a priority because the
4CYGnb__N28,352720,354639,home page organizes everything from
4CYGnb__N28,354639,356960,important notes to my schedule and has
4CYGnb__N28,356960,358880,all different tasks assigned and you can
4CYGnb__N28,358880,361280,also add to-do lists in addition to that
4CYGnb__N28,361280,362479,because it does sync with like a
4CYGnb__N28,362479,364160,schedule you're able to add certain
4CYGnb__N28,364160,366080,meeting notes to specific meetings that
4CYGnb__N28,366080,368080,you might have on your given calendar
4CYGnb__N28,368080,369360,and that is definitely something that we
4CYGnb__N28,369360,371440,have to do with the number of calls and
4CYGnb__N28,371440,373280,communications throughout a given day
4CYGnb__N28,373280,375280,whether you're on your smartphone tablet
4CYGnb__N28,375280,377360,web app or computer you're easily able
4CYGnb__N28,377360,378880,to access all of your notes in an
4CYGnb__N28,378880,380800,organized form from anywhere and also
4CYGnb__N28,380800,382960,search specific things within your own
4CYGnb__N28,382960,384639,kind of like company database it is
4CYGnb__N28,384639,385520,something that i've used since
4CYGnb__N28,385520,387360,university and in a business where we're
4CYGnb__N28,387360,389039,always coming up with ideas and a lot of
4CYGnb__N28,389039,391039,them are just being brainstormed before
4CYGnb__N28,391039,393680,being moved on to actual production this
4CYGnb__N28,393680,395360,is just a very essential part of our
4CYGnb__N28,395360,396400,workflow so if you guys would go ahead
4CYGnb__N28,396400,397840,and check it out i'm gonna link down
4CYGnb__N28,397840,401039,below to a free trial
4CYGnb__N28,404800,406479,so i've had to pick one favorite thing
4CYGnb__N28,406479,408319,in this entire gear bag aside from like
4CYGnb__N28,408319,410080,the necessities such as my phone and my
4CYGnb__N28,410080,412319,laptop it would easily have to be the
4CYGnb__N28,412319,415039,leica q2 camera i was someone who didn't
4CYGnb__N28,415039,416800,really take many photos on trips before
4CYGnb__N28,416800,418160,every photo would come from like the
4CYGnb__N28,418160,420000,iphone and that was just because i work
4CYGnb__N28,420000,422319,in the video space of course on youtube
4CYGnb__N28,422319,424319,and most of the time i was worried about
4CYGnb__N28,424319,426479,filming video and i just wouldn't really
4CYGnb__N28,426479,428880,think of taking any photos and on top of
4CYGnb__N28,428880,430639,that bringing like another photo camera
4CYGnb__N28,430639,432319,and having different lenses just made it
4CYGnb__N28,432319,434000,essentially like too overwhelming to
4CYGnb__N28,434000,436319,focus on all things at once so i
4CYGnb__N28,436319,438479,originally picked up like a fuji x100v
4CYGnb__N28,438479,440560,camera that was a single focal length
4CYGnb__N28,440560,441919,really really portable fits in the
4CYGnb__N28,441919,443199,pocket and you just take it around
4CYGnb__N28,443199,446000,anywhere and snap a photo but then i saw
4CYGnb__N28,446000,448960,some friends pick up the leica q2 and i
4CYGnb__N28,448960,450720,saw the price tag honestly thought it
4CYGnb__N28,450720,452720,was way too much for a camera that is
4CYGnb__N28,452720,454880,like relatively limited in its feature
4CYGnb__N28,454880,456479,set it's able to take photos but it has
4CYGnb__N28,456479,458800,a single focal length but after seeing
4CYGnb__N28,458800,460400,the images and the quality that comes
4CYGnb__N28,460400,462240,out of it and that kind of like extra
4CYGnb__N28,462240,464400,like 20 percent that you get from
4CYGnb__N28,464400,466560,spending a lot more money
4CYGnb__N28,466560,468160,i figured that i would go ahead and pick
4CYGnb__N28,468160,470080,one up on facebook marketplace got a
4CYGnb__N28,470080,471840,pretty good price on it and i've had it
4CYGnb__N28,471840,473360,for about a year now and i have
4CYGnb__N28,473360,475680,absolutely loved it just take a look at
4CYGnb__N28,475680,477520,the photos that it's able to grab when
4CYGnb__N28,477520,479680,i'm walking around and i am not filming
4CYGnb__N28,479680,481440,video that day or something i'll just
4CYGnb__N28,481440,483520,have this on my strap just to keep it
4CYGnb__N28,483520,485199,safe but this is able to shoot photos in
4CYGnb__N28,485199,487840,48 megapixel at a fixed 28 millimeter
4CYGnb__N28,487840,489840,focal length and it is just super easy
4CYGnb__N28,489840,491680,to use you have your shutter dial on the
4CYGnb__N28,491680,493680,top you have your focus dial on the
4CYGnb__N28,493680,495599,front here as well as your aperture and
4CYGnb__N28,495599,497680,you can also have the focus set to the
4CYGnb__N28,497680,499919,macro mode and for the most part i have
4CYGnb__N28,499919,502240,like the face and eye tracking on and
4CYGnb__N28,502240,504000,it's just a casual camera that everyone
4CYGnb__N28,504000,506160,on your trip can enjoy and just capture
4CYGnb__N28,506160,507759,those moments because that is the most
4CYGnb__N28,507759,509599,important thing about photography so on
4CYGnb__N28,509599,511039,the earbud side of things this is one
4CYGnb__N28,511039,512560,area that has changed a little bit since
4CYGnb__N28,512560,515039,the last what's on my bag video before i
4CYGnb__N28,515039,516800,would use like bose earbuds that were
4CYGnb__N28,516800,518719,wired back when everything still had
4CYGnb__N28,518719,521680,like a headphone jack but now in 2022
4CYGnb__N28,521680,523279,that is pretty much being eliminated
4CYGnb__N28,523279,525120,everywhere and unless i bring another
4CYGnb__N28,525120,527360,adapter which i forget all the time i've
4CYGnb__N28,527360,529760,gone fully wireless those bose earbuds
4CYGnb__N28,529760,530800,were really good i mean they were
4CYGnb__N28,530800,533279,reliable they were able to
4CYGnb__N28,533279,535040,noise isolate but i've switched over to
4CYGnb__N28,535040,536720,these truly wireless earbuds and i've
4CYGnb__N28,536720,539360,been testing the sony 1000 xm4s but i
4CYGnb__N28,539360,541760,also have my trusty apple airpods pro
4CYGnb__N28,541760,543519,and to be honest i'm kind of split on
4CYGnb__N28,543519,545200,which one that i like more the apple
4CYGnb__N28,545200,546880,airpod is one that i'm just personally
4CYGnb__N28,546880,548880,used to and i really like the sound
4CYGnb__N28,548880,551519,quality is pretty decent and the noise
4CYGnb__N28,551519,554320,cancellation is good i usually find that
4CYGnb__N28,554320,556399,on flights i can listen to dialogue and
4CYGnb__N28,556399,557760,music and all that kind of stuff and as
4CYGnb__N28,557760,559279,long as that is isolated that's pretty
4CYGnb__N28,559279,560959,much all i need i don't need any like
4CYGnb__N28,560959,563440,extreme level of noise isolation but i
4CYGnb__N28,563440,566240,will say the xm4s definitely give you a
4CYGnb__N28,566240,568800,better noise isolation and slightly
4CYGnb__N28,568800,570800,better sound quality as well but the
4CYGnb__N28,570800,572959,reason why i don't plan to bring them on
4CYGnb__N28,572959,575120,another trip is just because the comfort
4CYGnb__N28,575120,577279,level is just not as good as the apple
4CYGnb__N28,577279,579839,airpods there is like this like foam tip
4CYGnb__N28,579839,581680,to it that is able to like mold to your
4CYGnb__N28,581680,583600,ear and give you like kind of a memory
4CYGnb__N28,583600,586080,foam fit but i just found that it was
4CYGnb__N28,586080,588320,too tight and because of the weight
4CYGnb__N28,588320,590160,difference and all that kind of stuff on
4CYGnb__N28,590160,591920,like a seven or eight hour flight i was
4CYGnb__N28,591920,593839,able to wear them for like two hours
4CYGnb__N28,593839,595440,maybe before i'd have to like take them
4CYGnb__N28,595440,596800,out once in a while and found them a
4CYGnb__N28,596800,598640,little bit irritating so yeah the apple
4CYGnb__N28,598640,600240,airpods pro is one that i'm using at the
4CYGnb__N28,600240,601680,moment so when it comes like the phones
4CYGnb__N28,601680,603040,that i brought on this trip my daily
4CYGnb__N28,603040,605600,phone of course is the iphone 13 pro
4CYGnb__N28,605600,607680,this right here is one that just gets
4CYGnb__N28,607680,609519,the job done i mean it's not like flashy
4CYGnb__N28,609519,611360,it's nothing exciting it is just
4CYGnb__N28,611360,613360,reliable it's what i'm used to the form
4CYGnb__N28,613360,615120,factor is nice the battery life is
4CYGnb__N28,615120,617600,pretty decent so yeah you guys have seen
4CYGnb__N28,617600,619279,videos of this and the what's on my
4CYGnb__N28,619279,621440,iphone video that i did recently nothing
4CYGnb__N28,621440,622880,really new about that but some of the
4CYGnb__N28,622880,624560,apps that i definitely recommend having
4CYGnb__N28,624560,626959,are of all the airlines that you're
4CYGnb__N28,626959,629760,flying with a lot of times they do want
4CYGnb__N28,629760,631200,you to use the app for like getting the
4CYGnb__N28,631200,632560,boarding passes and even if you're
4CYGnb__N28,632560,634240,flying through one airline there might
4CYGnb__N28,634240,635920,be multiple ones that are connected to
4CYGnb__N28,635920,637519,it so having all the travel apps that
4CYGnb__N28,637519,640000,you need on here and any resources as
4CYGnb__N28,640000,641680,well as like google translate because my
4CYGnb__N28,641680,643760,spanish is awful has been very very
4CYGnb__N28,643760,645360,useful and i would recommend that for
4CYGnb__N28,645360,647600,everyone we're in barcelona with oppo
4CYGnb__N28,647600,648959,though and they just recently launched
4CYGnb__N28,648959,651600,the oppo fine x pro smartphone and this
4CYGnb__N28,651600,653120,is their new flagship at the moment
4CYGnb__N28,653120,654880,along with their parent partnership with
4CYGnb__N28,654880,656880,hasselblad as you can see this beautiful
4CYGnb__N28,656880,659040,ceramic back this gorgeous display on
4CYGnb__N28,659040,661040,the front that covers all around it but
4CYGnb__N28,661040,662800,what we're really testing out this trip
4CYGnb__N28,662800,665440,is the camera capabilities and not only
4CYGnb__N28,665440,667440,is there a 50 megapixel main camera as
4CYGnb__N28,667440,670079,well as a 50 megapixel ultra wide camera
4CYGnb__N28,670079,672320,but there is also a 13 megapixel
4CYGnb__N28,672320,674800,telephoto camera as well and the big
4CYGnb__N28,674800,677200,focus is the mira silicon x npu
4CYGnb__N28,677200,679200,developed by oppo and that is what
4CYGnb__N28,679200,681360,brings features such as 4k hdr night
4CYGnb__N28,681360,682880,video and of course we're going to be
4CYGnb__N28,682880,685040,testing out the photo and video modes
4CYGnb__N28,685040,686240,throughout the day in different
4CYGnb__N28,686240,688320,scenarios on all the trips to europe
4CYGnb__N28,688320,689920,actually it's being with oppo to go
4CYGnb__N28,689920,691760,ahead and test out their brand new phone
4CYGnb__N28,691760,693680,the low light performance the zoom and
4CYGnb__N28,693680,694880,all that kind of stuff and it's been
4CYGnb__N28,694880,696160,interesting to see how they've gotten
4CYGnb__N28,696160,698320,really creative with the camera over the
4CYGnb__N28,698320,700079,years i remember testing out the
4CYGnb__N28,700079,702720,periscope zoom in switzerland to like
4CYGnb__N28,702720,704240,night photo when it was still relatively
4CYGnb__N28,704240,707040,new in milan italy so yeah this trip has
4CYGnb__N28,707040,709360,been like using all the cameras and
4CYGnb__N28,709360,711200,especially the ultra wide cameras when
4CYGnb__N28,711200,712959,taking pictures of like architecture as
4CYGnb__N28,712959,714639,well even though i do have my backpack a
4CYGnb__N28,714639,716800,lot of times i don't really need to take
4CYGnb__N28,716800,718399,that whole backpack i just need my
4CYGnb__N28,718399,720079,laptop to go downstairs to the coffee
4CYGnb__N28,720079,722399,shop get some work done and so i still
4CYGnb__N28,722399,724160,bring like a pouch here it is just like
4CYGnb__N28,724160,726720,a simple canvas one from herschel and it
4CYGnb__N28,726720,729200,just like is very minimal it stays clean
4CYGnb__N28,729200,731040,it has like a nice magnetic opening to
4CYGnb__N28,731040,733200,it laptop slides in and the reason why
4CYGnb__N28,733200,735279,i'm using this is because i have a lot
4CYGnb__N28,735279,738880,of 13-inch laptop cases and most of them
4CYGnb__N28,738880,741040,didn't fit my new macbook pro 14-inch it
4CYGnb__N28,741040,742800,was just a little bit too thick a little
4CYGnb__N28,742800,745120,bit wider and this is one that is able
4CYGnb__N28,745120,747279,to fit it so it was kind of the obvious
4CYGnb__N28,747279,749360,choice but i find it's good to just have
4CYGnb__N28,749360,751120,like that secondary layer of protection
4CYGnb__N28,751120,752800,in the backpack because i usually have a
4CYGnb__N28,752800,754959,ton of stuff that's just rolling around
4CYGnb__N28,754959,757200,and can kind of get in the way of it so
4CYGnb__N28,757200,758720,yeah that is it
4CYGnb__N28,758720,760800,on the topic of macbooks and tech in
4CYGnb__N28,760800,762720,general though one essential accessory
4CYGnb__N28,762720,765040,when traveling is the proper power brick
4CYGnb__N28,765040,766720,and once again we have quite a few of
4CYGnb__N28,766720,768880,these and we have to cover a large range
4CYGnb__N28,768880,771360,of tech products including cameras
4CYGnb__N28,771360,773600,laptops like phone batteries and all
4CYGnb__N28,773600,775360,that kind of stuff and all those require
4CYGnb__N28,775360,777120,different wattages to be able to charge
4CYGnb__N28,777120,779200,at the fastest speed possible so in
4CYGnb__N28,779200,781440,front of me i have the ugreen nexo 100
4CYGnb__N28,781440,783680,watt gallium nitrate charger and this
4CYGnb__N28,783680,785680,has been my go-to charger for both at
4CYGnb__N28,785680,788000,home and day-to-day use as well as on
4CYGnb__N28,788000,790160,travel because it is able to charge up
4CYGnb__N28,790160,792399,to 100 watts so if you have the macbook
4CYGnb__N28,792399,795920,pro m1 16-inch or 14-inch it is able to
4CYGnb__N28,795920,798000,support that wattage and give you a fast
4CYGnb__N28,798000,799839,charge but at the same time it is a
4CYGnb__N28,799839,801760,foreign one which gives you three usb
4CYGnb__N28,801760,804639,type c ports and a usb type a port and
4CYGnb__N28,804639,806320,it will adjust the wattage allocation
4CYGnb__N28,806320,807920,depending on what you have plugged into
4CYGnb__N28,807920,809519,it so if it's just the macbook for
4CYGnb__N28,809519,811519,example it will give you up to 100 watts
4CYGnb__N28,811519,813040,and if you have like an ipad a
4CYGnb__N28,813040,815120,smartphone and a camera plugged in it
4CYGnb__N28,815120,817200,will kind of allocate that safely and
4CYGnb__N28,817200,819120,accordingly it is also significantly
4CYGnb__N28,819120,821199,smaller than apple's first party charger
4CYGnb__N28,821199,822880,because it fits in the palm of your hand
4CYGnb__N28,822880,824880,and it's very travel friendly with the
4CYGnb__N28,824880,827040,prong that is able to flip in so yeah
4CYGnb__N28,827040,828560,like having three ports is really great
4CYGnb__N28,828560,830160,for being able to charge various devices
4CYGnb__N28,830160,832480,that are mostly usb type c nowadays but
4CYGnb__N28,832480,834639,it's still nice to have that one usb
4CYGnb__N28,834639,836959,type a port occasionally in terms of
4CYGnb__N28,836959,838560,real world speeds it is able to charge
4CYGnb__N28,838560,842079,your iphone 13 to 60 in just 30 minutes
4CYGnb__N28,842079,844079,and it can fully charge your macbook pro
4CYGnb__N28,844079,846720,16 inch in just one and a half hour so
4CYGnb__N28,846720,847600,if you guys want to go ahead and check
4CYGnb__N28,847600,848800,it out for yourself i'm going to drop a
4CYGnb__N28,848800,850320,link down below and they've also given
4CYGnb__N28,850320,852000,me a discount code which puts it at a
4CYGnb__N28,852000,854000,very good price point as for some of the
4CYGnb__N28,854000,855600,smaller accessories i like to carry them
4CYGnb__N28,855600,857440,in a few different pouches so i have one
4CYGnb__N28,857440,858720,right here that is like the western
4CYGnb__N28,858720,860800,digital black one and you can find a lot
4CYGnb__N28,860800,862639,of like similar things like this or like
4CYGnb__N28,862639,865839,toiletry cases on like amazon and here i
4CYGnb__N28,865839,867440,have some of the camera accessories the
4CYGnb__N28,867440,870959,card readers and also the ssds
4CYGnb__N28,870959,872560,so i just have like a red one here and
4CYGnb__N28,872560,875680,there is also an additional adapter so
4CYGnb__N28,875680,877920,there i have my sd card slot my usbs
4CYGnb__N28,877920,880079,from satechi and on top of that this
4CYGnb__N28,880079,881680,right here is the western digital black
4CYGnb__N28,881680,884320,four terabyte nvme ssd that is able to
4CYGnb__N28,884320,886240,give me plenty of storage to back up all
4CYGnb__N28,886240,888160,my files typically when it comes to
4CYGnb__N28,888160,890320,filming on trips because we can't refilm
4CYGnb__N28,890320,893120,this stuff like again i do back it up to
4CYGnb__N28,893120,894639,the computer as soon as i get to the
4CYGnb__N28,894639,896480,hotel at the end of the day and then
4CYGnb__N28,896480,899120,i'll back it up over to an ssd right
4CYGnb__N28,899120,900959,after so in the event that we're out
4CYGnb__N28,900959,902480,about the next day the camera gets
4CYGnb__N28,902480,904399,stolen sd cards in there we at least
4CYGnb__N28,904399,906320,still have all the data which is
4CYGnb__N28,906320,908399,something that money can't buy back the
4CYGnb__N28,908399,909519,other accessory that i also brought in
4CYGnb__N28,909519,912240,this trip is the razer orochi v2 mouse
4CYGnb__N28,912240,913600,thanks to carl conrad for letting me
4CYGnb__N28,913600,915920,borrow this because i forgot mine but
4CYGnb__N28,915920,917839,this is like one of the world's lightest
4CYGnb__N28,917839,919680,mice and that makes it very good for
4CYGnb__N28,919680,921360,gaming but to be honest i just need it
4CYGnb__N28,921360,923920,for productivity and with it being so
4CYGnb__N28,923920,926560,like light and versatile i find that it
4CYGnb__N28,926560,928320,is a really good option i think this
4CYGnb__N28,928320,930399,white finish right here is very sleek
4CYGnb__N28,930399,932320,but you just go ahead and flip it open
4CYGnb__N28,932320,933920,here and you have the option to actually
4CYGnb__N28,933920,935040,use a
4CYGnb__N28,935040,937120,aaa battery or a double a battery and
4CYGnb__N28,937120,939839,the battery life is absolutely insane so
4CYGnb__N28,939839,940959,the other thing that i also brought on
4CYGnb__N28,940959,943759,this trip is the sony fx3 camera and i
4CYGnb__N28,943759,945440,know it might come as a huge surprise to
4CYGnb__N28,945440,947440,a lot of you guys that i switched over
4CYGnb__N28,947440,949360,to a sony camera
4CYGnb__N28,949360,950959,and that came as a surprise to me as
4CYGnb__N28,950959,952480,well i don't really have anything like
4CYGnb__N28,952480,954399,directly against sony but i just haven't
4CYGnb__N28,954399,956079,used their cameras in like the last five
4CYGnb__N28,956079,958320,years because i have been a huge canon
4CYGnb__N28,958320,960240,fan we also have like the reds and
4CYGnb__N28,960240,961519,everything that is committed to the
4CYGnb__N28,961519,964079,canon ecosystem especially with ef and
4CYGnb__N28,964079,966000,rf but when it came to like trying some
4CYGnb__N28,966000,968079,of the new cameras and hearing about
4CYGnb__N28,968079,970399,this one from my friend thomas i just
4CYGnb__N28,970399,972480,had to go ahead and give it a try and i
4CYGnb__N28,972480,975040,have absolutely loved it and in fact in
4CYGnb__N28,975040,976560,some of the recent videos that i would
4CYGnb__N28,976560,978720,usually use like my main camera for i
4CYGnb__N28,978720,981040,shot it all on the fx3 and it has like a
4CYGnb__N28,981040,983040,really nice cinematic look especially
4CYGnb__N28,983040,985199,with the light right lut to it and
4CYGnb__N28,985199,986480,there's just so many good things to say
4CYGnb__N28,986480,988639,about this and with the red setup it is
4CYGnb__N28,988639,990560,huge it's heavy it's big descent on the
4CYGnb__N28,990560,993199,plane but in this case i can just like
4CYGnb__N28,993199,995279,focus on what i'm filming and what i'm
4CYGnb__N28,995279,996800,trying to say
4CYGnb__N28,996800,998560,knowing that this camera is able to take
4CYGnb__N28,998560,1000959,care of a lot of the manual elements
4CYGnb__N28,1000959,1002240,usually attributed to a more
4CYGnb__N28,1002240,1004320,sophisticated process so when it comes
4CYGnb__N28,1004320,1005839,like a cable and accessory pouch i know
4CYGnb__N28,1005839,1008160,this video is like very tech oriented
4CYGnb__N28,1008160,1009600,and i mentioned that i do keep a lot of
4CYGnb__N28,1009600,1011519,the grab and go cables on the front here
4CYGnb__N28,1011519,1013360,and typically that is down to like usb
4CYGnb__N28,1013360,1015839,type-c the iphone cable and all that
4CYGnb__N28,1015839,1017440,kind of stuff that i might need at the
4CYGnb__N28,1017440,1019600,airport specifically but on top of that
4CYGnb__N28,1019600,1021120,there are still a lot of other things
4CYGnb__N28,1021120,1023040,that i usually have to charge and so i
4CYGnb__N28,1023040,1025199,bring like a nice pouch that has all the
4CYGnb__N28,1025199,1026959,camera accessories here you have the
4CYGnb__N28,1026959,1028959,spare batteries for like the main camera
4CYGnb__N28,1028959,1030720,you also have the computer chargers the
4CYGnb__N28,1030720,1032798,computer charging bricks high wattage
4CYGnb__N28,1032798,1035360,chargers and i usually try to bring a
4CYGnb__N28,1035360,1037360,combination of like a high wattage
4CYGnb__N28,1037360,1039600,charger a compact high wattage one and
4CYGnb__N28,1039600,1042000,also a spare smartphone one and i also
4CYGnb__N28,1042000,1043918,try to bring a variety of cables whether
4CYGnb__N28,1043918,1046558,it's a few usb type-c usb type-c to
4CYGnb__N28,1046558,1048480,lightning and occasionally also a usb-a
4CYGnb__N28,1048480,1050320,to lightning cable because some hotels
4CYGnb__N28,1050320,1052240,actually have usb ports built into the
4CYGnb__N28,1052240,1054080,headboard and so you can just go ahead
4CYGnb__N28,1054080,1055679,and plug it in there and use the brick
4CYGnb__N28,1055679,1057200,for something else on like an
4CYGnb__N28,1057200,1058720,international trip like this though you
4CYGnb__N28,1058720,1060799,also have to remember your plug adapters
4CYGnb__N28,1060799,1061919,another thing that you also don't want
4CYGnb__N28,1061919,1063760,to forget is a pen because a lot of
4CYGnb__N28,1063760,1065200,times you might have to like fill out
4CYGnb__N28,1065200,1067039,custom swarms and all that it's just a
4CYGnb__N28,1067039,1068960,handy thing to have when you need it as
4CYGnb__N28,1068960,1070799,for backup batteries to be honest we get
4CYGnb__N28,1070799,1073039,sent back up batteries and like chargers
4CYGnb__N28,1073039,1074640,all the time to the point where i don't
4CYGnb__N28,1074640,1076960,really have a preference at this day and
4CYGnb__N28,1076960,1078480,age they all get the job done they're
4CYGnb__N28,1078480,1080320,all able to like give you a decent
4CYGnb__N28,1080320,1082880,amount of capacity at a very slim size
4CYGnb__N28,1082880,1085200,and this right here is one that has i
4CYGnb__N28,1085200,1087440,believe 10 000 milliamp hours which is
4CYGnb__N28,1087440,1089919,more than enough for a long journey the
4CYGnb__N28,1089919,1091520,only thing that i really need is one
4CYGnb__N28,1091520,1094080,that has a usb type a port as well as a
4CYGnb__N28,1094080,1097039,usb type-c output and that is able to
4CYGnb__N28,1097039,1099520,get the ipad charged all the other stuff
4CYGnb__N28,1099520,1100960,charged and the port that i've really
4CYGnb__N28,1100960,1102799,been trying to eliminate out of my whole
4CYGnb__N28,1102799,1106160,workflow is chargers that need micro usb
4CYGnb__N28,1106160,1107679,because that is just bringing another
4CYGnb__N28,1107679,1110640,chord so yeah this one here is from like
4CYGnb__N28,1110640,1112559,inu and i believe it's relatively
4CYGnb__N28,1112559,1114880,inexpensive but so far this trip it has
4CYGnb__N28,1114880,1116640,been able to last the entire leg and
4CYGnb__N28,1116640,1121000,i've only had to recharge it once
4CYGnb__N28,1123679,1125039,so when it comes like the whole luggage
4CYGnb__N28,1125039,1126720,situation there has been a lot of
4CYGnb__N28,1126720,1128640,different setups over the years for
4CYGnb__N28,1128640,1130000,years i would just borrow it from my
4CYGnb__N28,1130000,1131840,parents grab some random luggage that i
4CYGnb__N28,1131840,1133520,could find but then i also started
4CYGnb__N28,1133520,1135360,traveling with just duffel bags and
4CYGnb__N28,1135360,1137039,camera bags everything was like soft
4CYGnb__N28,1137039,1139440,shell so you can really pack it but i've
4CYGnb__N28,1139440,1141440,also purchased like the luggages that
4CYGnb__N28,1141440,1143039,everyone seems to kind of talk about
4CYGnb__N28,1143039,1145520,which is remoa and to be honest i really
4CYGnb__N28,1145520,1147600,didn't like it at all the aluminum just
4CYGnb__N28,1147600,1149280,felt like it would always get damaged
4CYGnb__N28,1149280,1150559,and at the same time
4CYGnb__N28,1150559,1152000,you wouldn't you weren't able to like
4CYGnb__N28,1152000,1154720,pack it as like tightly just because it
4CYGnb__N28,1154720,1156960,was like a rigid shape so a few years
4CYGnb__N28,1156960,1159760,ago i picked up this away luggage and
4CYGnb__N28,1159760,1161120,generally speaking i have been pretty
4CYGnb__N28,1161120,1163039,happy with it this is the largest size
4CYGnb__N28,1163039,1164559,carry-on that they have i got it in a
4CYGnb__N28,1164559,1166960,very simple boring black finish that
4CYGnb__N28,1166960,1168880,looks like everyone else's luggage so i
4CYGnb__N28,1168880,1170240,got to put some sticker on it or
4CYGnb__N28,1170240,1173200,something but this is one that has like
4CYGnb__N28,1173200,1174720,nice little compartments you have one
4CYGnb__N28,1174720,1176559,side that zips up you also have a center
4CYGnb__N28,1176559,1178960,divider as well as another side that is
4CYGnb__N28,1178960,1181360,just completely open and what i have it
4CYGnb__N28,1181360,1183520,laid out as is i have all the t-shirts
4CYGnb__N28,1183520,1185840,rolled up on one side the hoodies and
4CYGnb__N28,1185840,1187919,everything and i also have like maybe
4CYGnb__N28,1187919,1189280,some shoes in there but the middle
4CYGnb__N28,1189280,1191440,compartment is only socks and underwear
4CYGnb__N28,1191440,1192720,and as soon as there's like dirty
4CYGnb__N28,1192720,1194400,laundry there's also like a pouch that
4CYGnb__N28,1194400,1196160,attaches to this which makes it very
4CYGnb__N28,1196160,1197919,easy to separate your clean and dirty
4CYGnb__N28,1197919,1199520,clothes so before we talk about the
4CYGnb__N28,1199520,1201600,clothes let's talk about the shoes so
4CYGnb__N28,1201600,1203600,i've got two pairs on this trip and i
4CYGnb__N28,1203600,1205440,would say that that is like the absolute
4CYGnb__N28,1205440,1207600,most that i would want to bring on a
4CYGnb__N28,1207600,1209600,full carry-on one one of them is like
4CYGnb__N28,1209600,1211600,the common projects which is like a nice
4CYGnb__N28,1211600,1212960,like white leather shoe that you guys
4CYGnb__N28,1212960,1214559,see me wear all the time but i recently
4CYGnb__N28,1214559,1216080,purchased this pair that has like a blue
4CYGnb__N28,1216080,1218000,heel to it and what i've noticed is that
4CYGnb__N28,1218000,1220400,this pair is a lot comfortable than the
4CYGnb__N28,1220400,1223039,typical original achilles low that
4CYGnb__N28,1223039,1225120,everyone knows and loves
4CYGnb__N28,1225120,1226559,and it's the fact that i didn't get any
4CYGnb__N28,1226559,1227919,blisters they didn't have to like break
4CYGnb__N28,1227919,1229200,in or anything i was able to wear them
4CYGnb__N28,1229200,1230799,right away and they look literally
4CYGnb__N28,1230799,1233440,exactly the same as the achilles low so
4CYGnb__N28,1233440,1234799,that is the pair that i wear like the
4CYGnb__N28,1234799,1236640,most i'm going to trade show meetings
4CYGnb__N28,1236640,1238400,and dinners it's just like a nice like
4CYGnb__N28,1238400,1241120,hybrid dressy piece um but at the same
4CYGnb__N28,1241120,1242320,time if you're on the plane you don't
4CYGnb__N28,1242320,1243919,want to be wearing like leather shoes
4CYGnb__N28,1243919,1248240,for 12 15 18 hours and so this is a pair
4CYGnb__N28,1248240,1251280,that i recently got and it is the apls
4CYGnb__N28,1251280,1253440,super simple it has like a bit of a
4CYGnb__N28,1253440,1255679,strap and elastic right here and you
4CYGnb__N28,1255679,1257360,don't have to like lace it up or
4CYGnb__N28,1257360,1259280,anything just slip these on they
4CYGnb__N28,1259280,1261200,ventilate very nicely and they're super
4CYGnb__N28,1261200,1262880,comfortable and another thing that i've
4CYGnb__N28,1262880,1264640,really liked doing during this trip is
4CYGnb__N28,1264640,1267039,just going for a quick walk or run i'm
4CYGnb__N28,1267039,1268720,someone who hates running because i live
4CYGnb__N28,1268720,1270400,in a small town and i just feel like
4CYGnb__N28,1270400,1271919,it's very pointless beyond like the
4CYGnb__N28,1271919,1273600,health benefits so if you like go on
4CYGnb__N28,1273600,1275360,your run and appreciate the surroundings
4CYGnb__N28,1275360,1276880,before you know it you're already done
4CYGnb__N28,1276880,1279120,that run and you went way further than
4CYGnb__N28,1279120,1280960,you thought you could so yeah i like
4CYGnb__N28,1280960,1282799,having a pair of like hybrid shoes that
4CYGnb__N28,1282799,1284559,are good for wearing around the airport
4CYGnb__N28,1284559,1286400,on the flight but also going for like a
4CYGnb__N28,1286400,1288000,quick run in the morning as for the
4CYGnb__N28,1288000,1289440,watch on this trip my favorite one of
4CYGnb__N28,1289440,1291760,course is the rolex daytona not only has
4CYGnb__N28,1291760,1293120,it been the best investment but it's
4CYGnb__N28,1293120,1294799,just the one that i will like the most
4CYGnb__N28,1294799,1296799,because it is very light to wear
4CYGnb__N28,1296799,1298320,relatively thin but i don't know if i
4CYGnb__N28,1298320,1299760,mentioned this when i first purchased
4CYGnb__N28,1299760,1301679,this and saw it in person for the first
4CYGnb__N28,1301679,1304320,time it was a lot smaller than i
4CYGnb__N28,1304320,1306559,expected so yeah it's like a very nice
4CYGnb__N28,1306559,1308400,everyday watch i know nowadays like the
4CYGnb__N28,1308400,1310320,submariners are seen all the time and i
4CYGnb__N28,1310320,1312000,do have like the green submariner that i
4CYGnb__N28,1312000,1313919,wear quite often as well
4CYGnb__N28,1313919,1315440,but i feel like this is like the very
4CYGnb__N28,1315440,1317600,precious piece that despite the raise
4CYGnb__N28,1317600,1319520,and value over the years i think i'm
4CYGnb__N28,1319520,1321280,going to hold on to it for a very long
4CYGnb__N28,1321280,1323760,time because i actually sold my ap 39
4CYGnb__N28,1323760,1325520,millimeter stainless royal oak to
4CYGnb__N28,1325520,1327919,purchase this and even though i'm more
4CYGnb__N28,1327919,1330480,happy with this watch overall i wish i
4CYGnb__N28,1330480,1332320,didn't sell that one because as soon as
4CYGnb__N28,1332320,1333440,you sell them at one point it's very
4CYGnb__N28,1333440,1335120,hard to get back into it because the
4CYGnb__N28,1335120,1337520,prices just fly so fast so when it comes
4CYGnb__N28,1337520,1339120,like the clothing of this trip right now
4CYGnb__N28,1339120,1340880,in barcelona everyone is in like a
4CYGnb__N28,1340880,1342799,jacket which coming from canada i
4CYGnb__N28,1342799,1344320,thought was kind of funny because it is
4CYGnb__N28,1344320,1348159,about 15 degrees celsius which for me is
4CYGnb__N28,1348159,1350240,probably considered more on like the
4CYGnb__N28,1350240,1352400,warmer medium and so for the most part
4CYGnb__N28,1352400,1354000,i've just been rocking crewnecks and i
4CYGnb__N28,1354000,1356240,absolutely love it um and so i've got
4CYGnb__N28,1356240,1358000,one right here that is a represent one i
4CYGnb__N28,1358000,1359280,also have another one here that is like
4CYGnb__N28,1359280,1361600,the represent owner's collection in like
4CYGnb__N28,1361600,1364400,the gray and green and so these are very
4CYGnb__N28,1364400,1366320,easy to wear anywhere um they're not too
4CYGnb__N28,1366320,1368159,hot they're not too cool um definitely
4CYGnb__N28,1368159,1369760,don't want to catch a cold i also
4CYGnb__N28,1369760,1371200,decided to bring this balenciaga crew
4CYGnb__N28,1371200,1372559,neck that i purchased a few years ago
4CYGnb__N28,1372559,1374559,honestly i haven't worn this one in like
4CYGnb__N28,1374559,1377200,a very very long time
4CYGnb__N28,1377200,1379600,i don't know just decided to uh bring it
4CYGnb__N28,1379600,1382240,out for this trip um yeah nothing really
4CYGnb__N28,1382240,1384080,special about it but
4CYGnb__N28,1384080,1387039,in 2019 i was really really into like
4CYGnb__N28,1387039,1388799,clothing and spending money on like
4CYGnb__N28,1388799,1390960,designer stuff and to be honest aside
4CYGnb__N28,1390960,1392799,from like the represent and stuff from
4CYGnb__N28,1392799,1394720,my own clothing brand i haven't really
4CYGnb__N28,1394720,1396400,purchased any new clothes like
4CYGnb__N28,1396400,1398320,whatsoever since then when it comes to
4CYGnb__N28,1398320,1399679,going around the airport i also brought
4CYGnb__N28,1399679,1402080,like a simple black hoodie not too hot
4CYGnb__N28,1402080,1403440,not too cool this is just like one of
4CYGnb__N28,1403440,1405520,the prototypes from my clothing brand of
4CYGnb__N28,1405520,1408080,course and it's yeah warm enough for the
4CYGnb__N28,1408080,1410240,flight but i also do bring like a shell
4CYGnb__N28,1410240,1411840,jacket just in case it's a little bit
4CYGnb__N28,1411840,1413679,cooler at night this is one from a
4CYGnb__N28,1413679,1415120,company called members only that i
4CYGnb__N28,1415120,1416640,brought on this trip and i actually pick
4CYGnb__N28,1416640,1418640,it up for just ten dollars at a thrift
4CYGnb__N28,1418640,1420400,shop i have heard from some people that
4CYGnb__N28,1420400,1422159,this was actually like a pretty popular
4CYGnb__N28,1422159,1423840,brand like back in the day but i guess i
4CYGnb__N28,1423840,1426240,wasn't born at the time it was because i
4CYGnb__N28,1426240,1427600,have actually never heard of it but like
4CYGnb__N28,1427600,1428720,underneath the hoodie i think it just
4CYGnb__N28,1428720,1430720,adds like a very nice layer to it and as
4CYGnb__N28,1430720,1432480,someone who doesn't like to really dress
4CYGnb__N28,1432480,1434480,up i feel like this at least helps a
4CYGnb__N28,1434480,1436080,little bit with a pair of like white
4CYGnb__N28,1436080,1438080,leather shoes but on like a trip where
4CYGnb__N28,1438080,1439760,it's a little bit cooler then i might
4CYGnb__N28,1439760,1441440,bring like a bomber jacket like the one
4CYGnb__N28,1441440,1443360,that i've worn from represent before as
4CYGnb__N28,1443360,1445360,for like other things such as pajamas
4CYGnb__N28,1445360,1447200,this is just like a shirt from uniqlo i
4CYGnb__N28,1447200,1448320,think it's like an athletic one but it
4CYGnb__N28,1448320,1450320,keeps you nice and cool relatively
4CYGnb__N28,1450320,1452320,affordable and i just started picking up
4CYGnb__N28,1452320,1454720,some of the uniqlo stuff but i also have
4CYGnb__N28,1454720,1456880,a lot of like h m undershirts don't
4CYGnb__N28,1456880,1458480,really need anything fancy but just wear
4CYGnb__N28,1458480,1460320,these underneath like a crew neck or
4CYGnb__N28,1460320,1462880,hoodie they're like nine dollars and so
4CYGnb__N28,1462880,1464880,on a trip like this i'll bring like one
4CYGnb__N28,1464880,1467120,per day um seven or eight of them and
4CYGnb__N28,1467120,1469440,all my socks by the way are from ebay so
4CYGnb__N28,1469440,1471600,anything that is like an undergarment i
4CYGnb__N28,1471600,1473840,just buy like the absolute cheapest ones
4CYGnb__N28,1473840,1476080,and buy a ton of it on a trip like this
4CYGnb__N28,1476080,1477440,though where i don't anticipate i'm
4CYGnb__N28,1477440,1479279,going to be needing a t-shirt i just
4CYGnb__N28,1479279,1481279,bring like one in case that is a little
4CYGnb__N28,1481279,1483600,bit like fancier not like an undershirt
4CYGnb__N28,1483600,1485679,and this is the one from my clothing
4CYGnb__N28,1485679,1486400,company
4CYGnb__N28,1486400,1489039,and it's just like a heavyweight t-shirt
4CYGnb__N28,1489039,1490240,obviously we sell our clothes at a
4CYGnb__N28,1490240,1492880,retail store in canada so people do like
4CYGnb__N28,1492880,1495200,a thicker material and so this has like
4CYGnb__N28,1495200,1496720,a nice color and everything to it the
4CYGnb__N28,1496720,1498320,texture is great and so i'll wear this
4CYGnb__N28,1498320,1500240,if i'm just like going for a workout or
4CYGnb__N28,1500240,1503760,a run and pair this with like the 24 7
4CYGnb__N28,1503760,1505520,represent shorts so when it comes to the
4CYGnb__N28,1505520,1507039,toiletry bag this is where i have like
4CYGnb__N28,1507039,1508960,all the essentials when it comes to like
4CYGnb__N28,1508960,1510240,skin care
4CYGnb__N28,1510240,1512240,like the contact lens solution all that
4CYGnb__N28,1512240,1514799,kind of stuff as well as like my shaver
4CYGnb__N28,1514799,1516559,toothbrush i always seem to forget
4CYGnb__N28,1516559,1519440,something but i try my best to remember
4CYGnb__N28,1519440,1521200,and so i have everything stored in here
4CYGnb__N28,1521200,1523120,and the way i usually have my travel
4CYGnb__N28,1523120,1526080,pack divided is liquids on one side and
4CYGnb__N28,1526080,1527840,all the other stuff on the other and
4CYGnb__N28,1527840,1529919,then i put this all into like a
4CYGnb__N28,1529919,1532799,watertight bag in my luggage or in my
4CYGnb__N28,1532799,1535440,backpack and so if it does leak which
4CYGnb__N28,1535440,1537440,occasionally does happen then it doesn't
4CYGnb__N28,1537440,1539919,get over all my stuff and also having
4CYGnb__N28,1539919,1541440,quick access to be able to take out a
4CYGnb__N28,1541440,1544400,tsa just makes things a lot easier so
4CYGnb__N28,1544400,1546080,i've been using this like wash bag for
4CYGnb__N28,1546080,1548240,quite a few years now and
4CYGnb__N28,1548240,1549600,in terms of what i have in it at the
4CYGnb__N28,1549600,1552159,moment my overall like process is very
4CYGnb__N28,1552159,1553600,very simple when it comes to getting
4CYGnb__N28,1553600,1555600,ready in the morning each day the bruce
4CYGnb__N28,1555600,1556880,electric toothbrush because it is
4CYGnb__N28,1556880,1558880,relatively portable i really like that
4CYGnb__N28,1558880,1560559,one and i also bring like a small
4CYGnb__N28,1560559,1562320,toothpaste as well and on top of that i
4CYGnb__N28,1562320,1564240,also bring my babyliss double foil
4CYGnb__N28,1564240,1566720,shaver and i absolutely love that my
4CYGnb__N28,1566720,1568799,barber recommended it to me and i don't
4CYGnb__N28,1568799,1571120,use like any shaving cream or anything i
4CYGnb__N28,1571120,1572720,just go ahead and use that every morning
4CYGnb__N28,1572720,1574640,and it just leaves your skin very very
4CYGnb__N28,1574640,1576240,smooth and after that i don't use like
4CYGnb__N28,1576240,1578640,any aftershave i'll just like have some
4CYGnb__N28,1578640,1580960,cold water just to close all the pores
4CYGnb__N28,1580960,1582559,and generally speaking that has worked
4CYGnb__N28,1582559,1584159,for me on top of that though when it
4CYGnb__N28,1584159,1585919,comes to like skin care for those who
4CYGnb__N28,1585919,1587520,really watch videos from the past few
4CYGnb__N28,1587520,1589200,years you might have remembered that my
4CYGnb__N28,1589200,1591360,last travel bag video in 2019 my lips
4CYGnb__N28,1591360,1593360,were just like all like crackled up and
4CYGnb__N28,1593360,1594400,everyone said i should just get some
4CYGnb__N28,1594400,1596480,like chapstick but at the time i was on
4CYGnb__N28,1596480,1598640,accutane which was to get rid of all the
4CYGnb__N28,1598640,1600240,acne and
4CYGnb__N28,1600240,1601679,one of the side effects was your lips
4CYGnb__N28,1601679,1603840,would be super chapped even if you like
4CYGnb__N28,1603840,1605360,always have like
4CYGnb__N28,1605360,1607120,chapstick and all that kind of stuff but
4CYGnb__N28,1607120,1609440,that's all like over with um so nowadays
4CYGnb__N28,1609440,1611840,my skincare routine is just like the
4CYGnb__N28,1611840,1613840,aesop one that i have at home and then
4CYGnb__N28,1613840,1616000,before i go to bed i use the neutrogena
4CYGnb__N28,1616000,1618720,hydro boost which is just like one pump
4CYGnb__N28,1618720,1620400,on each side and just like spread it
4CYGnb__N28,1620400,1622400,around and i mean you wake up the next
4CYGnb__N28,1622400,1625360,morning your skin is all good and yeah
4CYGnb__N28,1625360,1627120,nowadays it's just that and on top of
4CYGnb__N28,1627120,1628159,that some of the other things that i
4CYGnb__N28,1628159,1630159,also have to bring are my contact lens
4CYGnb__N28,1630159,1632240,solution and cleaning kit when it comes
4CYGnb__N28,1632240,1633600,to the hair there's also only like two
4CYGnb__N28,1633600,1635200,products that i bring one of them is
4CYGnb__N28,1635200,1636640,just like something called the cantu
4CYGnb__N28,1636640,1638320,coconut curling cream and even though i
4CYGnb__N28,1638320,1640080,don't have like curly hair that is the
4CYGnb__N28,1640080,1642240,reason why i use it this curling cream
4CYGnb__N28,1642240,1643679,with just like a little bit is able to
4CYGnb__N28,1643679,1645279,just like soften up my hair a little bit
4CYGnb__N28,1645279,1647039,because as you guys had seen in past
4CYGnb__N28,1647039,1649039,videos it grows straight up and it
4CYGnb__N28,1649039,1650720,doesn't look very good when it gets a
4CYGnb__N28,1650720,1652559,little bit long on the front so just
4CYGnb__N28,1652559,1654399,give it a of a bit of like volume right
4CYGnb__N28,1654399,1656159,after i get out of the shower while the
4CYGnb__N28,1656159,1657600,hair is moist i just get some of that
4CYGnb__N28,1657600,1659120,curling cream in and then i'll go ahead
4CYGnb__N28,1659120,1660640,and grab my hair wax which i've been
4CYGnb__N28,1660640,1662640,using the lay right blue for quite a few
4CYGnb__N28,1662640,1664880,years now and just like mix it in i
4CYGnb__N28,1664880,1667200,don't usually like to use too much but
4CYGnb__N28,1667200,1668559,yeah that's pretty much like the hair
4CYGnb__N28,1668559,1670559,care routine on certain trips if i'm
4CYGnb__N28,1670559,1672720,checking in baggage i might bring like
4CYGnb__N28,1672720,1674559,my dyson hair dryer and the volumizer
4CYGnb__N28,1674559,1675760,and all that kind of stuff just because
4CYGnb__N28,1675760,1677679,we have to film but generally speaking
4CYGnb__N28,1677679,1679440,i've been completely fine without it as
4CYGnb__N28,1679440,1681679,you can tell unless you think my
4CYGnb__N28,1681679,1683840,hair looks terrible unlike a trip over a
4CYGnb__N28,1683840,1685200,week i might also just borrow a pair of
4CYGnb__N28,1685200,1686880,scissors and give it a quick little trim
4CYGnb__N28,1686880,1688320,and call my barber while he kind of
4CYGnb__N28,1688320,1690000,yells at me for it so yeah when it comes
4CYGnb__N28,1690000,1691440,like this toiletry stuff some of you
4CYGnb__N28,1691440,1692640,care i'm sure some of you guys don't
4CYGnb__N28,1692640,1694480,give a crap but i thought i'd mention
4CYGnb__N28,1694480,1696080,some of the products anyways because i'm
4CYGnb__N28,1696080,1697679,definitely someone who learns from other
4CYGnb__N28,1697679,1699600,people's routines and once i like that
4CYGnb__N28,1699600,1701679,item i stick to it for a very long time
4CYGnb__N28,1701679,1702880,but otherwise that pretty much wraps it
4CYGnb__N28,1702880,1704399,up for my what's in my bag video for
4CYGnb__N28,1704399,1706000,this trip and as always i hope you guys
4CYGnb__N28,1706000,1707039,enjoyed it make sure you go ahead and
4CYGnb__N28,1707039,1708720,drop a like if you did subscribe to the
4CYGnb__N28,1708720,1709679,channel
4CYGnb__N28,1709679,1711039,and yeah i feel like i've covered
4CYGnb__N28,1711039,1713039,everything here um it might look very
4CYGnb__N28,1713039,1714960,clean in this hotel room but it actually
4CYGnb__N28,1714960,1717600,isn't so hope you guys enjoy this and
4CYGnb__N28,1717600,1721559,i'll see you all when i get back
