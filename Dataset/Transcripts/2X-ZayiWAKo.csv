2X-ZayiWAKo,7180,10139,One thing I love about Intel extreme home upgrade

2X-ZayiWAKo,14890,18290,"sponsored by Intel, to upgrade their home setup,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,18290,19880,I learn a lot about them.
2X-ZayiWAKo,19880,22640,Like some people are more into multimedia
2X-ZayiWAKo,22640,24890,and others are hardcore into gaming
2X-ZayiWAKo,24890,27500,"and still others, like Dennis,"

2X-ZayiWAKo,169502,170569,- Yeah you can't be minimalist
2X-ZayiWAKo,170570,173760,with like machines strapped to your shoulders and feet.
2X-ZayiWAKo,173760,174739,That's not minimalism.
2X-ZayiWAKo,174740,177870,"- Imagine this, Linus, I have this shoulder massager"
2X-ZayiWAKo,177870,178769,with this headphone.

2X-ZayiWAKo,182563,184230,"- (laughs)Okay, I was able to imagine it up"
2X-ZayiWAKo,184230,185243,until that last bit.
2X-ZayiWAKo,185243,186690,(all laughing)
2X-ZayiWAKo,186690,188230,Why don't we look at the current setup?
2X-ZayiWAKo,188230,189310,"- Okay, okay, Linus, stop."
2X-ZayiWAKo,189310,191459,Nothing stolen from work.
2X-ZayiWAKo,191460,194930,"- Well, at least some of this definitely came from work."
2X-ZayiWAKo,194930,196280,"I mean, it's got our label on it."
2X-ZayiWAKo,196280,197490,- It's signed out.
2X-ZayiWAKo,197490,199320,"If it's signed out, it's not stolen."
2X-ZayiWAKo,199320,201580,"- Okay, well wait a minute, hold on, you have-"
2X-ZayiWAKo,201580,202413,"- So okay,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,202413,205220,let me explain what happened to this (cock crows)
2X-ZayiWAKo,205220,208080,Razor that you gave us like a couple of years ago
2X-ZayiWAKo,208080,209100,at that Christmas party.
2X-ZayiWAKo,209100,209933,"Look at this, look at this."
2X-ZayiWAKo,209933,211530,- You hear that? You hear how angry he is about-?
2X-ZayiWAKo,211530,213666,"You know what, maybe I shouldn't give you anything."
2X-ZayiWAKo,213666,214499,(Dennis laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,214499,215650,"Yeah, why don't I give the home upgrade"
2X-ZayiWAKo,215650,217010,to someone who will appreciate it?
2X-ZayiWAKo,217010,217989,- Just not Razor!
2X-ZayiWAKo,217990,218823,(technical difficulty beep)
2X-ZayiWAKo,218823,220300,"Look at the batteries. They've expanded,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,220300,222430,"and I didn't realize it till- - Oh yeah, look at that."
2X-ZayiWAKo,222430,223750,- Like last month.
2X-ZayiWAKo,223750,224810,And look at here.
2X-ZayiWAKo,224810,226599,- Yeah touch pad has like bowed.
2X-ZayiWAKo,226600,229100,So you know that you shouldn't keep
2X-ZayiWAKo,229100,230210,"that battery in there, right?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,230210,231580,"- I know, but I don't know- - It's a fire hazard."
2X-ZayiWAKo,231580,232850,- I don't know how to deal with it.
2X-ZayiWAKo,232850,234560,- What? It's like eight screws.
2X-ZayiWAKo,234560,236140,You just take them out and pop the thing out.
2X-ZayiWAKo,236140,238890,- But I still have my stuff in there.
2X-ZayiWAKo,238890,241600,- So? (David laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,241600,243970,- So now I sign up another Razor.
2X-ZayiWAKo,243970,244803,- Why would you-?
2X-ZayiWAKo,244803,246463,- Alex recommend Razor 13.
2X-ZayiWAKo,247430,248773,- Why do you have two pairs of headphones?
2X-ZayiWAKo,248773,251239,You're not minimalistic at all Dennis.
2X-ZayiWAKo,251240,252410,- I'm trying to.
2X-ZayiWAKo,252410,254950,"So this is, I've been using this for a long time."
2X-ZayiWAKo,254950,256989,It's Logitech. What is this actually?
2X-ZayiWAKo,256989,257823,- Corsair.
2X-ZayiWAKo,257823,260573,- Corsair! Corsair. (Dennis laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,260573,264810,"Corsair RGB wireless thing. Um, it dies."
2X-ZayiWAKo,264810,266520,"- I'm so triggered right now. - 'Cause of wireless, it dies."
2X-ZayiWAKo,266520,267610,- I'm so triggered right now.
2X-ZayiWAKo,267610,268560,Look at this.
2X-ZayiWAKo,268560,272520,What kind of monster adjusts their headphones like this?
2X-ZayiWAKo,272520,273353,- Oh what?
2X-ZayiWAKo,274580,276085,I guess I have to do it evenly.
2X-ZayiWAKo,276085,278020,(David laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,278020,279741,"- Oh my god, no wonder you get-"
2X-ZayiWAKo,279742,281063,"- Don't say it, don't say it."
2X-ZayiWAKo,281063,282819,"- No, no, no,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,282820,284267,no wonder you get sore.
2X-ZayiWAKo,284267,286833,(Dennis and Linus laugh)
2X-ZayiWAKo,286833,289280,Look at this chair! It's metal!
2X-ZayiWAKo,289280,292610,"- Linus, I told you in order to let you understand"
2X-ZayiWAKo,292610,296090,"why I bought so many massagers for me,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,296090,297780,- Yeah - you had to try to sit here.
2X-ZayiWAKo,297780,299706,"- Oh, it looks so uncomfortable."
2X-ZayiWAKo,299706,301070,(Dennis laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,301070,302680,- So we have a pillow.
2X-ZayiWAKo,302680,304400,You can have the pillow. - That's not minimalism!
2X-ZayiWAKo,304400,306380,- But you have more options.
2X-ZayiWAKo,306380,307970,So like you can change- (film crew laughing)
2X-ZayiWAKo,307970,310480,You can change the color like from a different season.
2X-ZayiWAKo,310480,313180,"Like this is more like winter color,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,313180,314990,and this is the kind of winter as well.
2X-ZayiWAKo,314990,316490,- [Linus] That's not winter!
2X-ZayiWAKo,316490,317580,"- Yeah, it's orange!"
2X-ZayiWAKo,317580,320150,"- Okay, David or Other David, any David,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,320150,323630,back me up on this is: is this winter?
2X-ZayiWAKo,323630,324510,- [Other David] Absolutely not.
2X-ZayiWAKo,324510,325620,- Thank you.
2X-ZayiWAKo,325620,326453,- [Other David] Maybe Halloween.
2X-ZayiWAKo,326453,327286,(Dennis laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,327286,329040,"- So let's look at this minute, cable management."
2X-ZayiWAKo,329040,329873,"Look at this, it's so-"
2X-ZayiWAKo,329873,331930,- Your cable management is dog (fart noise).
2X-ZayiWAKo,331930,332889,Let's go look at-
2X-ZayiWAKo,332890,334160,"Okay, let's go."
2X-ZayiWAKo,334160,337650,- Let's go see my guest room also slash office.
2X-ZayiWAKo,337650,338483,- [Linus] Yeah.
2X-ZayiWAKo,338483,339810,"Oh, well this is way nicer."
2X-ZayiWAKo,339810,340710,- [Dennis] What do you mean?
2X-ZayiWAKo,340710,342050,This is all Apple stuff.
2X-ZayiWAKo,342050,343422,"- [Linus] Yeah, but it's not like-"
2X-ZayiWAKo,343423,345090,- [Dennis] Look at the keyboard.
2X-ZayiWAKo,345090,346919,- [Linus] There's only one pair of headphones
2X-ZayiWAKo,346920,349610,- So this is the kind of thing that people usually
2X-ZayiWAKo,349610,352090,like the minimalistic style.
2X-ZayiWAKo,352090,353880,"- Yeah, and David's desk is a lot nicer,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,353880,356043,other than that the drawers are all taped together
2X-ZayiWAKo,356043,356876,"for some reason. - Okay,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,356876,357709,"this is the worst desk,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,357709,359850,because this drawers open by itself sometimes.
2X-ZayiWAKo,359850,361304,I think my house is haunted.
2X-ZayiWAKo,361304,362280,(suspenseful noise)
2X-ZayiWAKo,362280,364169,- Are you sure that it's not just not level?
2X-ZayiWAKo,364169,365800,- (laughs)I'm not sure.
2X-ZayiWAKo,365800,367060,- Do you own a level?
2X-ZayiWAKo,367060,368970,"Yeah, it's not (beep) level Dennis,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,368970,369803,that's why the drawers open.
2X-ZayiWAKo,369803,370840,- You are pushing it this way.
2X-ZayiWAKo,370840,372195,- I'm not pushing it! - Okay.
2X-ZayiWAKo,372195,373959,(upbeat music)
2X-ZayiWAKo,373959,376820,(David laughs) (level clatters)
2X-ZayiWAKo,376820,378100,- [Linus] Someone's hidding here.
2X-ZayiWAKo,378100,379940,"- Anyways, this is desk needs to go."
2X-ZayiWAKo,379940,380773,I also like-
2X-ZayiWAKo,380773,381700,- This desk looks really nice!
2X-ZayiWAKo,381700,382533,"- Sit here, sit here."
2X-ZayiWAKo,382533,384599,"- Well, the chair sucks. That's your problem."
2X-ZayiWAKo,384600,386050,"- The chair sucks, okay."
2X-ZayiWAKo,386050,388650,"Look at that, you put your feet, look at, do you feel it?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,388650,389710,"Oh, you're too short."
2X-ZayiWAKo,389710,392310,"This room, you can see it's like kind of empty right?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,392310,394919,We need something here to pop the room.
2X-ZayiWAKo,394920,396660,- Really doesn't look very empty to me.
2X-ZayiWAKo,396660,397493,- I got something
2X-ZayiWAKo,397493,399090,"to pop the room Linus. - Desk, ugly chair."
2X-ZayiWAKo,399090,400540,- I got something to pop the room for you.
2X-ZayiWAKo,400540,402030,- [Linus] To pop the room?
2X-ZayiWAKo,402030,403500,To pop the room.
2X-ZayiWAKo,403500,406510,- Look at this neon sign I bought! It's maybe $400.
2X-ZayiWAKo,406510,408272,"- [David] Live, laugh, Liao."
2X-ZayiWAKo,408272,410400,(Dennis laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,410400,414280,- You spent $400 of Intel's money on this?
2X-ZayiWAKo,414280,415720,"- Live, laugh, Liao."
2X-ZayiWAKo,415720,416800,"- No, are you serious?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,416800,417633,- Yes.
2X-ZayiWAKo,417633,418755,"- Wait, live, laugh, Liao?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,418756,419940,(Dennis laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,419940,422210,How did you afford all of this?
2X-ZayiWAKo,422210,424030,"- Because I buy this first and then I figured out,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,424030,425180,"oh, why it needs for PC."
2X-ZayiWAKo,425180,426930,So this is more important than PCs.
2X-ZayiWAKo,426930,428570,"- I'm so sorry, Intel."
2X-ZayiWAKo,428570,430270,I didn't know he was gonna do this.
2X-ZayiWAKo,430270,432910,That just looks like complete gibberish to me.
2X-ZayiWAKo,432910,434940,"- Well Linus, you don't understand art."
2X-ZayiWAKo,434940,436930,Oh-ho! That's cool.
2X-ZayiWAKo,436930,439440,Look at that! You don't wanna be on Zoom meeting?
2X-ZayiWAKo,439440,440366,Just do this.
2X-ZayiWAKo,440366,442612,"- You know what the best mode for it, though? That one."
2X-ZayiWAKo,442612,444121,(Dennis laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,444121,446780,"Like, this is handmade, look at that hot glue."
2X-ZayiWAKo,446780,450403,- This is the part I'm most excited for.
2X-ZayiWAKo,451332,452282,That. Look at that.
2X-ZayiWAKo,453800,455310,"- See with the other ones,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,455310,457700,"like either it was someone competent like Anthony,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,457700,460060,who I could trust to put together good stuff.
2X-ZayiWAKo,460060,462200,Or I helped them with their list of stuff.
2X-ZayiWAKo,462200,464020,"This is the first one where I wasn't involved,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,464020,465520,and look what (beep) happens.
2X-ZayiWAKo,465520,466919,Look what happens.
2X-ZayiWAKo,466920,470190,"Okay, all right, let's get this show on the road."
2X-ZayiWAKo,470190,471023,- [Dennis] Okay.
2X-ZayiWAKo,471023,471920,- Don't touch the wall.
2X-ZayiWAKo,471920,474750,- I know. I painted your walls. I don't wanna fix them.
2X-ZayiWAKo,474750,477090,"There's nothing wrong with this desk, Dennis!"
2X-ZayiWAKo,477090,478030,- [Dennis] I don't like it.
2X-ZayiWAKo,478030,480639,- [Linus] How did you get such expensive stuff?
2X-ZayiWAKo,480640,482673,Isn't this like a thousand dollar desk?
2X-ZayiWAKo,483760,486110,"- Yeah, but this brand is actually pretty cheap."
2X-ZayiWAKo,486110,487202,"- Oh, wait last."
2X-ZayiWAKo,488060,489613,I don't have any tools at home.
2X-ZayiWAKo,490590,493020,"- Yeah, we've been through this, I believe you."
2X-ZayiWAKo,493020,496525,- I can call my neighbor having call for deliver tools.
2X-ZayiWAKo,496525,497358,(doorbell rings)
2X-ZayiWAKo,497358,498997,"My tool guy is here, I think."
2X-ZayiWAKo,498997,500510,"Tool delivery, you see,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,500510,501920,you don't need to own any tools.
2X-ZayiWAKo,501920,503730,"Look at this Linus, this tabletop"
2X-ZayiWAKo,503730,505400,is so pretty just like dbrand.
2X-ZayiWAKo,505400,507110,"- It's not just like dbrand, it's..."
2X-ZayiWAKo,507110,508560,- I think it's probably better than dbrand.
2X-ZayiWAKo,508560,511740,"- Obviously I like, it's a natural wood countertop"
2X-ZayiWAKo,511740,513680,is better than a vinyl sticker.
2X-ZayiWAKo,513680,515919,I don't think dbrand would argue with you about that.
2X-ZayiWAKo,515919,516900,"- Yes, sure."
2X-ZayiWAKo,516900,521250,Look so pretty and white and clean.
2X-ZayiWAKo,521250,522789,I'll be so happy to edit on this.
2X-ZayiWAKo,522789,524570,- So you told David to roll the camera.
2X-ZayiWAKo,524570,525740,Was there a point to this or?
2X-ZayiWAKo,525740,528180,"- There's no point, I think I love it already."
2X-ZayiWAKo,528180,531300,- While he hopefully puts together the desk correctly.
2X-ZayiWAKo,531300,534589,"I'm gonna build the PC, but since I don't wanna sit"
2X-ZayiWAKo,534590,538190,"on his horrible metal chairs, which by the way, oh my god"
2X-ZayiWAKo,538190,540224,"you have so many of them, Dennis."
2X-ZayiWAKo,540224,541057,- What?
2X-ZayiWAKo,541057,543550,- You spent a thousand dollars on uncomfortable chairs?
2X-ZayiWAKo,543550,545638,"- Oh yeah, I have many of them, I"
2X-ZayiWAKo,545638,546916,(David laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,546916,549610,but the thing is I bought them from festival marketplace.
2X-ZayiWAKo,549610,551959,"So I got a really good deal, I paid $40 each."
2X-ZayiWAKo,551960,553440,- You know why you got a good deal?
2X-ZayiWAKo,553440,554353,- Why
2X-ZayiWAKo,554353,555186,- Because they're not comfortable.
2X-ZayiWAKo,555186,558365,"- But they are modern, like comfortable to my eyes."
2X-ZayiWAKo,558365,559380,(David laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,559380,561700,"- So I'm gonna build the chair, so that I can sit"
2X-ZayiWAKo,561700,563520,in the chair while I build the computer.
2X-ZayiWAKo,563520,564950,You know you have a drill right there.
2X-ZayiWAKo,564950,566300,Why are you doing everything by hand?
2X-ZayiWAKo,566300,567330,This is gonna take forever.
2X-ZayiWAKo,567330,568950,- They don't have the bits for
2X-ZayiWAKo,568950,570400,"- Dennis, these are drill bits."
2X-ZayiWAKo,570400,572930,These are not screws bits.
2X-ZayiWAKo,572930,574130,"- Oh my god, I broke it."
2X-ZayiWAKo,574130,576790,- None of this has hammed up for the camera off camera.
2X-ZayiWAKo,576790,578750,"It's pure, solid gold."
2X-ZayiWAKo,578750,582170,"Every moment, just like this, I can't even believe it."
2X-ZayiWAKo,582170,583269,Did you just
2X-ZayiWAKo,583270,585740,he's like ripping the handles off his neighbors.
2X-ZayiWAKo,585740,587610,"- Oh, look at that site they have."
2X-ZayiWAKo,587610,590600,"- Look at that, look at that, they got everything here."
2X-ZayiWAKo,590600,592279,- Is this a main tool.
2X-ZayiWAKo,592280,593270,- I know it is.
2X-ZayiWAKo,593270,594940,"I can tell cause it's not yours,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,594940,597120,"test time, how's this chair."
2X-ZayiWAKo,597120,599670,I read a really good review from a user
2X-ZayiWAKo,599670,600940,"who said after a while,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,600940,603330,it was kind of like sitting on directly on
2X-ZayiWAKo,603330,604980,the plastic underneath it.
2X-ZayiWAKo,604980,606110,And I can kind of see what they mean.
2X-ZayiWAKo,606110,608029,"I wished the foam was a little firmer,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,608030,608863,it would be
2X-ZayiWAKo,608863,610310,way better than the metal chairs.
2X-ZayiWAKo,610310,612170,You've been in here this whole time
2X-ZayiWAKo,612170,613060,and you put in
2X-ZayiWAKo,614819,617589,- Linus first of all - like 15 screws.
2X-ZayiWAKo,617590,619900,"- When we line up this thing, you didn't line up properly."
2X-ZayiWAKo,619900,620990,It was the wrong length.
2X-ZayiWAKo,620990,621930,I had to take this apart
2X-ZayiWAKo,621930,624440,"and readjust it, your fault head first."
2X-ZayiWAKo,624440,626380,- All right. - I fixed that.
2X-ZayiWAKo,626380,627663,- And you're quite sure that goes there.
2X-ZayiWAKo,627663,628970,- Yap. 100%
2X-ZayiWAKo,628970,630110,- Why would it go there?
2X-ZayiWAKo,630110,632019,- If you could do this?
2X-ZayiWAKo,632020,633650,"- I mean, that's where I would put it, yeah."
2X-ZayiWAKo,633650,635510,"- But this is facing back though, right?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,635510,636800,- I would think so.
2X-ZayiWAKo,636800,638850,Unless you want your cable management holes coming up
2X-ZayiWAKo,638850,639683,in the front of the desk?
2X-ZayiWAKo,639683,640720,"No, wait, that's not right."
2X-ZayiWAKo,640720,643379,Cause then how do you see your phone charger cable come up?
2X-ZayiWAKo,643380,644630,"- No, this is the back"
2X-ZayiWAKo,646750,648600,- Are the holes in the back or front.
2X-ZayiWAKo,651360,653220,"Oh yeah right, right, it's sponsored by Intel."
2X-ZayiWAKo,653220,656720,"So we've gone with a core i7, 10, 700."
2X-ZayiWAKo,656720,659600,Dennis wasn't realistically gonna be overclocking anything.
2X-ZayiWAKo,659600,664259,"And for what he's doing, eight cores is freaking a lot."
2X-ZayiWAKo,664260,668040,So this is a perfect balance of like excellent performance
2X-ZayiWAKo,668040,671701,and I'm giving him more money to spend on neon signs.
2X-ZayiWAKo,671702,672740,(laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,672740,675370,Motherboard choice makes a little bit less sense to me.
2X-ZayiWAKo,675370,678930,"This is an MPG, Z four 90 M motherboard from MSI"
2X-ZayiWAKo,678930,680940,it's an ATX in spite of the fact
2X-ZayiWAKo,680940,683230,that we've got a full-sized ATX case
2X-ZayiWAKo,683230,686430,and it's Z four 90 which is the flagship chip set
2X-ZayiWAKo,686430,690040,that's capable of overclocking and higher memory speeds
2X-ZayiWAKo,690040,691980,which as you may recall
2X-ZayiWAKo,691980,695670,we did not get a case series unlocked over clockable CPU
2X-ZayiWAKo,695670,700570,and Dennis chipped out on the memory going for DDR for 3000.
2X-ZayiWAKo,700570,703923,"So I don't, I mean, it's pretty."
2X-ZayiWAKo,703923,706930,It's cool and that too got a one terabyte Cybriant.
2X-ZayiWAKo,706930,708690,"Yes, this is the cheapo QLC one"
2X-ZayiWAKo,708690,713110,this was part of the save a buck strategy here.
2X-ZayiWAKo,713110,715170,This does look like a gen four capable slot.
2X-ZayiWAKo,715170,717200,It's got the metal thing on it
2X-ZayiWAKo,717200,719610,and this is probably gen 4 already as well.
2X-ZayiWAKo,719610,721860,"So you've got a good upgrade path, Dennis."
2X-ZayiWAKo,721860,723019,- [Dennis] That's good.
2X-ZayiWAKo,723020,724470,- He's never gonna spend any more money on this.
2X-ZayiWAKo,724470,726319,He's busy blowing it on uncomfortable chairs.
2X-ZayiWAKo,726320,728090,"Hey Dennis, you said you chipped out on your Ram"
2X-ZayiWAKo,728090,730130,but this is like RGB stuff.
2X-ZayiWAKo,730130,731750,"- Yeah, is RGB cheap?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,731750,733150,"- Well, no it would be better"
2X-ZayiWAKo,733150,735290,to just get a better spec instead of RGB.
2X-ZayiWAKo,735290,737949,"Did you, did you tell Nicholas you wanted RGB?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,737950,739970,"- I say I want like, not RGB"
2X-ZayiWAKo,739970,741379,"on kind of like a little bit lighting,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,741380,743950,"but I don't need RGB, I need white light."
2X-ZayiWAKo,743950,746180,"- Well here nothing comes like that, I mean."
2X-ZayiWAKo,746180,747013,- Are they bad?
2X-ZayiWAKo,747013,748650,"- No, they're fine."
2X-ZayiWAKo,748650,750500,- How big are those in group?
2X-ZayiWAKo,750500,752410,"- 16 gigs total, which is--"
2X-ZayiWAKo,752410,753410,- 16 total?
2X-ZayiWAKo,753410,756629,"- Yeah, well you bought chair, neon sign"
2X-ZayiWAKo,756630,760040,"light fixture, foot massager, shoulder massager."
2X-ZayiWAKo,760040,761399,- Foot massager.
2X-ZayiWAKo,761400,763540,"- I know I said that already, mixed up."
2X-ZayiWAKo,763540,766389,"- Look at this how pretty,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,766390,767830,- It's very pretty Dennis.
2X-ZayiWAKo,767830,769400,I actually liked the old one better.
2X-ZayiWAKo,769400,770373,"- What, no."
2X-ZayiWAKo,771210,772140,- Oh my God.
2X-ZayiWAKo,772140,772973,- What?
2X-ZayiWAKo,772973,774220,"What's wrong, what's wrong."
2X-ZayiWAKo,774220,775750,- You put the holes in the back.
2X-ZayiWAKo,775750,776800,"- Don't, don't fool me."
2X-ZayiWAKo,776800,778279,I know what you're doing.
2X-ZayiWAKo,778280,780000,- Now that the desk is finally done.
2X-ZayiWAKo,780000,782610,Do you want to work on the computer
2X-ZayiWAKo,782610,783800,or do you wanna work on something else?
2X-ZayiWAKo,783800,784959,- I can work on the cabinet?
2X-ZayiWAKo,784960,785840,I have a cabinet.
2X-ZayiWAKo,785840,788200,I would really not to touch PC stuff.
2X-ZayiWAKo,788200,789670,"- Yeah, that's probably best."
2X-ZayiWAKo,789670,791923,"- Don't all jeez, don't feel the socket."
2X-ZayiWAKo,792970,795418,"- Wait, there's no assembly, this is just a cabinet."
2X-ZayiWAKo,795418,796251,(Dennis laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,796251,798009,What were you gonna be working on?
2X-ZayiWAKo,798010,799246,- Just being lazy.
2X-ZayiWAKo,799246,800550,(David laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,800550,801383,"- It's just for that,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,801383,803260,I'm gonna have you do the light fixture.
2X-ZayiWAKo,803260,805330,"- Oh my god, that's the hardest part."
2X-ZayiWAKo,805330,806163,- Wait.
2X-ZayiWAKo,806163,806996,I don't have a ladder.
2X-ZayiWAKo,806996,808139,- How are we going to get up there?
2X-ZayiWAKo,808140,808973,- My neighbor
2X-ZayiWAKo,810150,811890,- Wouldn't you just hate being this guy's neighbor
2X-ZayiWAKo,811890,813533,- A hundred dollars light bulb.
2X-ZayiWAKo,814398,815848,"Look at this big ball, Linus."
2X-ZayiWAKo,816780,817780,"- I see that,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,817780,820150,(Dennis laughs) filing a complaint with HR.
2X-ZayiWAKo,820150,822057,"Did you get a, like a bulb for it?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,822057,823540,- [Dennis] Yeah I got it.
2X-ZayiWAKo,823540,824769,"- [Linus] Oh, did you get it open already?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,824770,825603,- Yeah.
2X-ZayiWAKo,826830,829208,Oh my god.
2X-ZayiWAKo,829208,830041,(beep)
2X-ZayiWAKo,830041,830930,- [Linus] I mean good save.
2X-ZayiWAKo,830930,832820,"- Holly, that's why I do in the back."
2X-ZayiWAKo,832820,833653,What do I do now?
2X-ZayiWAKo,833653,834486,This is connected.
2X-ZayiWAKo,834486,835319,"- Yeah, you got to disconnect it."
2X-ZayiWAKo,835319,836282,Hold on a second.
2X-ZayiWAKo,836282,837630,We don't even need the ladder.
2X-ZayiWAKo,837630,838690,We don't need the ladder.
2X-ZayiWAKo,838690,839980,Here we go.
2X-ZayiWAKo,839980,842149,I'm coming to the rescue.
2X-ZayiWAKo,842149,843850,"- Oh my God, - Oh my God that's really high"
2X-ZayiWAKo,843850,844740,- well I'm up really high.
2X-ZayiWAKo,844740,846384,"- Well, you gotta pull the wires out Dennis."
2X-ZayiWAKo,846384,847217,You can't do what you are doing.
2X-ZayiWAKo,847217,848899,"You pull, yeah you just pull it."
2X-ZayiWAKo,848900,850150,Dennis did you turn off the breaker?
2X-ZayiWAKo,850150,850983,- I did.
2X-ZayiWAKo,850983,852350,- Well then you don't have to like
2X-ZayiWAKo,852350,853579,be ginger about touching it
2X-ZayiWAKo,853580,854676,Just grab it.
2X-ZayiWAKo,854676,855509,(Dennis screams)
2X-ZayiWAKo,855509,856342,You don't have to be like.
2X-ZayiWAKo,856342,857175,(Linus screams)
2X-ZayiWAKo,857175,858300,(Dennis laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,858300,859641,"- I didn't do that, did I?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,859642,860755,(playback sound)
2X-ZayiWAKo,860755,862080,(screams)
2X-ZayiWAKo,862080,863550,- This is a really nice case.
2X-ZayiWAKo,863550,865990,I love the O 11 series from lee and lee.
2X-ZayiWAKo,865990,869209,Not necessarily like the greatest cooling
2X-ZayiWAKo,869210,871040,"if you don't configure it, right."
2X-ZayiWAKo,871040,872750,"But if you do, actually"
2X-ZayiWAKo,872750,877160,the cooling is really solid and lots of tempered glass.
2X-ZayiWAKo,877160,879069,I think they look just fantastic.
2X-ZayiWAKo,879070,881330,"Honestly, it's so nice to have the time to just sit"
2X-ZayiWAKo,881330,883390,and kind of relax and do cable management
2X-ZayiWAKo,883390,885660,while someone else is doing the hard part
2X-ZayiWAKo,885660,888100,of the home rig upgrade.
2X-ZayiWAKo,888100,888933,Oh yeah.
2X-ZayiWAKo,888933,892430,"We went with an RM eight 50 X from Coursera, it's efficient."
2X-ZayiWAKo,892430,894350,It's reasonably priced.
2X-ZayiWAKo,894350,895380,It's fully modular.
2X-ZayiWAKo,895380,897680,So we don't have any extra cables that we don't need.
2X-ZayiWAKo,897680,899550,Maybe one thing about the setup
2X-ZayiWAKo,899550,900839,that's a little bit minimalistic
2X-ZayiWAKo,900840,902900,is the modular power supply.
2X-ZayiWAKo,902900,903733,That's about it.
2X-ZayiWAKo,903733,906319,I think that's actually all we need for...
2X-ZayiWAKo,906320,907843,"Oh no,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,908800,910300,I forgot about all this--
2X-ZayiWAKo,910300,913330,"You knew where I was going with this, didn't you?"
2X-ZayiWAKo,913330,917871,I forgot about the two boxes of RGB fans.
2X-ZayiWAKo,917871,922300,"Oh, I have never even heard of this brand before."
2X-ZayiWAKo,922300,923425,Pop here.
2X-ZayiWAKo,923425,924690,(laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,924690,927430,Apparently they're addressable RGB fans
2X-ZayiWAKo,928320,930290,are a sync or maybe not addressable.
2X-ZayiWAKo,930290,931820,"I don't know what they are,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,931820,932980,but there's a lot of them
2X-ZayiWAKo,932980,934810,and they come with a big old controller.
2X-ZayiWAKo,934810,937563,Nevermind so much for my relaxing cable management.
2X-ZayiWAKo,939660,942350,"Oh wait,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,942350,944160,it's touching the heat pipes.
2X-ZayiWAKo,944160,946279,"Oh, it's scratched it."
2X-ZayiWAKo,946280,947127,"Hi Dennis, what time--"
2X-ZayiWAKo,947127,948430,- Did you break it?
2X-ZayiWAKo,948430,951370,"- Nope, see it looks good."
2X-ZayiWAKo,951370,952203,- Okay
2X-ZayiWAKo,952203,953860,- Just step back and look at it.
2X-ZayiWAKo,953860,954693,Look how good it looks.
2X-ZayiWAKo,954693,957160,- That's why I drill extra hole on the wall.
2X-ZayiWAKo,957160,959029,Who says this I don't drill.
2X-ZayiWAKo,959030,961400,I drill more holes than you needed.
2X-ZayiWAKo,961400,963140,- Oh my god the extra hole you drill.
2X-ZayiWAKo,963140,964043,It's not like
2X-ZayiWAKo,964043,965490,(Dennis laughs) hidden.
2X-ZayiWAKo,965490,968060,How did you put a hole over there?
2X-ZayiWAKo,968060,969750,- Because we are marking with a pen.
2X-ZayiWAKo,969750,972300,I think it's just a random mark there.
2X-ZayiWAKo,972300,973575,- And so you just drill there.
2X-ZayiWAKo,973575,974408,(laughs)
2X-ZayiWAKo,974408,978030,"- That's my mark, otherwise it looks beautiful."

2X-ZayiWAKo,979440,981685,"live, laugh, Liao. - So you don't need a light,"
2X-ZayiWAKo,981685,982518,this all the light I need.
2X-ZayiWAKo,982518,984430,And this is the sleeping light.
2X-ZayiWAKo,984430,986020,"- Sleeping light, okay."
2X-ZayiWAKo,986020,988550,"Most people turn the light off when they sleep, but"
2X-ZayiWAKo,988550,989383,- Before you go to bed
2X-ZayiWAKo,989383,990480,you watch a movie
2X-ZayiWAKo,990480,991389,chill a little bit.

2X-ZayiWAKo,992223,993170,- Your TV is out there.
2X-ZayiWAKo,993170,995800,We're almost ready to install the graphics card.
2X-ZayiWAKo,995800,998060,I got really lucky on the fans.

2X-ZayiWAKo,1000650,1002590,which we gonna go ahead and plug in down here.
2X-ZayiWAKo,1002590,1005630,So we've got one for fan PWM control
2X-ZayiWAKo,1005630,1008750,and then one for the J rainbow jumpers.
2X-ZayiWAKo,1008750,1011270,So these are addressable RGB after all.
2X-ZayiWAKo,1011270,1013620,So go ahead and run that right there
2X-ZayiWAKo,1013620,1015820,is I don't have to install two hubs
2X-ZayiWAKo,1015820,1019500,because even though each kit only includes five fans
2X-ZayiWAKo,1019500,1022370,the hub takes up to seven fans.
2X-ZayiWAKo,1022370,1024540,So everything's all wired up back here.
2X-ZayiWAKo,1024540,1026750,You're gonna use this to play league of legends?

2X-ZayiWAKo,1049400,1052130,"Oh no David, I don't think this is a cheap 30, 80."
