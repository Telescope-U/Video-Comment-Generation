umCaMAtCrsg,3360,5520,this is your tech news briefing for
umCaMAtCrsg,5520,8480,monday june 27th i'm julie chang for the
umCaMAtCrsg,8480,10639,wall street journal filling in for zoe
umCaMAtCrsg,10639,12880,thomas
umCaMAtCrsg,12880,15519,virtual reality is popular for games and
umCaMAtCrsg,15519,18000,fitness it's also becoming more popular
umCaMAtCrsg,18000,20880,in senior communities rendevor is one vr
umCaMAtCrsg,20880,22880,company whose platform is increasingly
umCaMAtCrsg,22880,24800,being used to help seniors who might be
umCaMAtCrsg,24800,27599,struggling rendezvous co-founder and ceo
umCaMAtCrsg,27599,29760,kyle rand says some have used the
umCaMAtCrsg,29760,32238,company's vr platform to travel back to
umCaMAtCrsg,32238,34079,childhood streets connect with loved
umCaMAtCrsg,34079,35920,ones who are physically far away and
umCaMAtCrsg,35920,38640,more and he says that's helped improve
umCaMAtCrsg,38640,40480,their mental health
umCaMAtCrsg,40480,42079,at the wall street journal's recent
umCaMAtCrsg,42079,44399,future of everything festival rand spoke
umCaMAtCrsg,44399,47039,with wsj personal tech columnist nicole
umCaMAtCrsg,47039,50399,nguyen about how virtual reality can and
umCaMAtCrsg,50399,52719,is being used to combat loneliness in
umCaMAtCrsg,52719,54960,senior living communities here are
umCaMAtCrsg,54960,57360,highlights from their conversation so
umCaMAtCrsg,57360,60239,when people who are skeptical of virtual
umCaMAtCrsg,60239,63039,reality think of vr i think they think
umCaMAtCrsg,63039,66000,of a wally style future where you're
umCaMAtCrsg,66000,68720,floating around holding your giant soda
umCaMAtCrsg,68720,70960,with a screen strapped to your face
umCaMAtCrsg,70960,72560,completely ignorant of everything that's
umCaMAtCrsg,72560,74560,happening around you but your company is
umCaMAtCrsg,74560,75920,working on a very different take than
umCaMAtCrsg,75920,79360,that it's a virtual reality enabled
umCaMAtCrsg,79360,82960,therapy and wellness platform i believe
umCaMAtCrsg,82960,84479,um can you tell us a little bit more
umCaMAtCrsg,84479,86720,about what that therapy entails and and
umCaMAtCrsg,86720,89040,the role vr has in it yeah it's such an
umCaMAtCrsg,89040,90240,interesting
umCaMAtCrsg,90240,92000,perspective a lot of people so we're
umCaMAtCrsg,92000,93520,about to turn six years old our company
umCaMAtCrsg,93520,94720,around ever
umCaMAtCrsg,94720,97360,so six years ago vr was still very new
umCaMAtCrsg,97360,99280,and we came up with this idea of using
umCaMAtCrsg,99280,101280,it for older adults to empower a better
umCaMAtCrsg,101280,102880,lifestyle for them a lot of people
umCaMAtCrsg,102880,105040,thought oh this is just escapism right
umCaMAtCrsg,105040,107520,the ability to put on a headset and
umCaMAtCrsg,107520,109119,just be anywhere else other than a
umCaMAtCrsg,109119,110320,senior living community but really what
umCaMAtCrsg,110320,111360,we're doing is we've designed this
umCaMAtCrsg,111360,113040,platform that enables people to put
umCaMAtCrsg,113040,114799,these headsets on and they can go
umCaMAtCrsg,114799,116159,anywhere in the world they can stand on
umCaMAtCrsg,116159,117680,top of the eiffel tower they can go on a
umCaMAtCrsg,117680,119920,hot air balloon ride they can go back to
umCaMAtCrsg,119920,121200,their childhood home and stay in front
umCaMAtCrsg,121200,122320,of their childhood home again for the
umCaMAtCrsg,122320,123439,first time
umCaMAtCrsg,123439,124399,and
umCaMAtCrsg,124399,126560,they do it together so really it's a
umCaMAtCrsg,126560,128080,social experience platform where people
umCaMAtCrsg,128080,130319,are able to spend time doing real world
umCaMAtCrsg,130319,132560,things exploring the world and then
umCaMAtCrsg,132560,135520,building relationships as a result of it
umCaMAtCrsg,135520,137680,how are you structuring these platforms
umCaMAtCrsg,137680,139840,um what if you don't want to visit your
umCaMAtCrsg,139840,142640,childhood home for example uh how do you
umCaMAtCrsg,142640,144560,know what content to serve interestingly
umCaMAtCrsg,144560,146080,enough we've done demos for the past six
umCaMAtCrsg,146080,148160,years like every single age group if i
umCaMAtCrsg,148160,149360,tell someone they can go anywhere in the
umCaMAtCrsg,149360,150480,world nine times out of ten they're
umCaMAtCrsg,150480,151840,gonna say bring me home
umCaMAtCrsg,151840,153680,especially if they're very far away from
umCaMAtCrsg,153680,155200,home and so it's a really meaningful
umCaMAtCrsg,155200,157440,meaningful location but our approach to
umCaMAtCrsg,157440,159599,content creation and experience delivery
umCaMAtCrsg,159599,161920,is if they're like
umCaMAtCrsg,161920,163280,when you think about the aging process
umCaMAtCrsg,163280,165519,what happens day in and day out is your
umCaMAtCrsg,165519,167519,world starts to shrink right and what we
umCaMAtCrsg,167519,169040,can do in vr is we can open up those
umCaMAtCrsg,169040,170560,doors and
umCaMAtCrsg,170560,172560,the diversity of the aging demographic
umCaMAtCrsg,172560,173840,is so wide that somebody might want to
umCaMAtCrsg,173840,175200,go to paris somebody might want to go to
umCaMAtCrsg,175200,177360,israel somebody might want to spend like
umCaMAtCrsg,177360,179040,my grandfather when i first did a
umCaMAtCrsg,179040,181040,session with him we went on a hot air
umCaMAtCrsg,181040,181920,balloon ride we went swimming with
umCaMAtCrsg,181920,183200,dolphins we
umCaMAtCrsg,183200,184720,we went on a roller coaster ride and
umCaMAtCrsg,184720,186159,then i brought him back to his home in
umCaMAtCrsg,186159,187840,long island he still lives in long
umCaMAtCrsg,187840,189280,island so it was like i don't know 20
umCaMAtCrsg,189280,191280,miles away and then we spent two hours
umCaMAtCrsg,191280,193120,we were up until two in the morning
umCaMAtCrsg,193120,195519,exploring the streets of the areas that
umCaMAtCrsg,195519,196800,he grew up in and like that's what he
umCaMAtCrsg,196800,198239,leaned into because that's what's so
umCaMAtCrsg,198239,199760,significant for him
umCaMAtCrsg,199760,201920,and for this demographic
umCaMAtCrsg,201920,203519,when you create a connection to the
umCaMAtCrsg,203519,204480,place that you're visiting the
umCaMAtCrsg,204480,206400,experience that you're having it opens
umCaMAtCrsg,206400,208400,up the floor for communication that's
umCaMAtCrsg,208400,210799,really positive that oftentimes can be
umCaMAtCrsg,210799,212879,really hard to find before the session
umCaMAtCrsg,212879,215360,we were talking about um your new puppy
umCaMAtCrsg,215360,217680,your new dog dad but also that you have
umCaMAtCrsg,217680,220400,a puppy agenda um as it relates to
umCaMAtCrsg,220400,222560,content that's on this platform yes so
umCaMAtCrsg,222560,224000,one of the very first things that we
umCaMAtCrsg,224000,226080,launched was a room full of golden
umCaMAtCrsg,226080,228239,retriever puppies and golden lab puppies
umCaMAtCrsg,228239,230159,and i actually have an amazing story so
umCaMAtCrsg,230159,232239,that same community that first started
umCaMAtCrsg,232239,234159,uh we were doing this demonstration
umCaMAtCrsg,234159,236000,before we started working with them and
umCaMAtCrsg,236000,237120,we had like this whole group of
umCaMAtCrsg,237120,238879,residents everybody was experiencing vr
umCaMAtCrsg,238879,240560,they're having a great time and about
umCaMAtCrsg,240560,242560,halfway in they wheeled in a woman and
umCaMAtCrsg,242560,244480,her name was mickey and her caregiver
umCaMAtCrsg,244480,245519,pulled me aside i was like i need you to
umCaMAtCrsg,245519,247840,understand her story and
umCaMAtCrsg,247840,250000,he was like this woman was one of the
umCaMAtCrsg,250000,251599,first people to move into our community
umCaMAtCrsg,251599,253280,she's been with us since day one and she
umCaMAtCrsg,253280,254879,always has had a smile on her face like
umCaMAtCrsg,254879,256880,she knows everyone by name she's the
umCaMAtCrsg,256880,257919,first person to say hi to you in the
umCaMAtCrsg,257919,259919,morning she's just like this beacon of
umCaMAtCrsg,259919,261840,light in our community and then two
umCaMAtCrsg,261840,262800,months
umCaMAtCrsg,262800,264479,prior to that she had been diagnosed
umCaMAtCrsg,264479,265840,with early stage dementia and she was
umCaMAtCrsg,265840,267440,moved upstairs into the locked memory
umCaMAtCrsg,267440,268479,care floor
umCaMAtCrsg,268479,270560,and what happened was she had her first
umCaMAtCrsg,270560,272479,symptom was expressive aphasia so she
umCaMAtCrsg,272479,273840,actually lost her ability to communicate
umCaMAtCrsg,273840,275840,so she went for me this outgoing
umCaMAtCrsg,275840,277680,boisterous woman to all of a sudden not
umCaMAtCrsg,277680,279040,being able
umCaMAtCrsg,279040,280880,to talk and so what we did was we
umCaMAtCrsg,280880,282000,brought her into that room full of
umCaMAtCrsg,282000,283040,puppies
umCaMAtCrsg,283040,286320,and it was like this like a light switch
umCaMAtCrsg,286320,287840,turned right back on this huge smile
umCaMAtCrsg,287840,289199,comes across her face she like started
umCaMAtCrsg,289199,290720,calling out to the puppies like kissing
umCaMAtCrsg,290720,292400,at them and like virtual rooms
umCaMAtCrsg,292400,293680,a virtual room full of puppies very
umCaMAtCrsg,293680,296240,important and just got so engaged and so
umCaMAtCrsg,296240,298000,excited and she actually was talking to
umCaMAtCrsg,298000,299840,the dogs and the most amazing thing
umCaMAtCrsg,299840,301520,happened at the end of the session she
umCaMAtCrsg,301520,303759,took that headset off and she kept
umCaMAtCrsg,303759,304800,talking
umCaMAtCrsg,304800,306479,and she actually followed me and my
umCaMAtCrsg,306479,308240,co-founder out of the building holding
umCaMAtCrsg,308240,310639,onto my co-founder's arm and she was
umCaMAtCrsg,310639,312080,talking about how we needed to use this
umCaMAtCrsg,312080,314639,technology for children and to use it
umCaMAtCrsg,314639,315759,within school systems because it would
umCaMAtCrsg,315759,318720,be amazing to learn through vr if you
umCaMAtCrsg,318720,320080,think about that what happened was after
umCaMAtCrsg,320080,321840,just a 30 minute session in vr she went
umCaMAtCrsg,321840,323600,from three months of not talking at all
umCaMAtCrsg,323600,325919,to pitching us business ideas so content
umCaMAtCrsg,325919,328000,aside there's a lot that needs to be
umCaMAtCrsg,328000,330160,improved in the hardware itself you use
umCaMAtCrsg,330160,332000,a third party virtual reality headset
umCaMAtCrsg,332000,333120,correct correct
umCaMAtCrsg,333120,335280,things like battery life and the weight
umCaMAtCrsg,335280,337039,of the headset
umCaMAtCrsg,337039,337840,and
umCaMAtCrsg,337840,339360,especially when it comes to
umCaMAtCrsg,339360,342400,accessibility i have a left eye that's
umCaMAtCrsg,342400,344000,much worse than my right eye so when i
umCaMAtCrsg,344000,346720,use vr i feel nauseous i can't wear it
umCaMAtCrsg,346720,348880,for a long time and i imagine that a lot
umCaMAtCrsg,348880,351840,of your audience is visually impaired or
umCaMAtCrsg,351840,354880,has some other sort of a similar need
umCaMAtCrsg,354880,356639,how are you working around that yeah
umCaMAtCrsg,356639,358240,it's interesting i think we're really
umCaMAtCrsg,358240,360319,just starting to learn about the
umCaMAtCrsg,360319,362400,implications for visual impairments i
umCaMAtCrsg,362400,364960,think if you if it's laterally different
umCaMAtCrsg,364960,366080,that's that's something we haven't seen
umCaMAtCrsg,366080,367919,or tested yet but one of the most
umCaMAtCrsg,367919,369120,interesting things we've seen is people
umCaMAtCrsg,369120,370880,with glaucoma and with macular
umCaMAtCrsg,370880,372240,degeneration
umCaMAtCrsg,372240,373680,vr is actually one of their favorite
umCaMAtCrsg,373680,374880,things and
umCaMAtCrsg,374880,376639,the the research isn't there yet you
umCaMAtCrsg,376639,378400,know it's easy to guess that the reason
umCaMAtCrsg,378400,379840,they're able to actually see in vr is
umCaMAtCrsg,379840,381360,because the screen is so close and so
umCaMAtCrsg,381360,383440,their fovea like really widens but i
umCaMAtCrsg,383440,384880,think we're really as we look to the
umCaMAtCrsg,384880,386560,future you know the hardware has really
umCaMAtCrsg,386560,388080,done amazing things in the past couple
umCaMAtCrsg,388080,390400,of years there's a lot of places to go
umCaMAtCrsg,390400,392080,there's a lot of research to be done to
umCaMAtCrsg,392080,394560,understand how it works with a variety
umCaMAtCrsg,394560,396080,of different conditions if the audience
umCaMAtCrsg,396080,397600,has questions feel free to raise their
umCaMAtCrsg,397600,398560,hands
umCaMAtCrsg,398560,400319,and and ask
umCaMAtCrsg,400319,403520,is the content is it cg based or video
umCaMAtCrsg,403520,405680,based so it's a combination honestly
umCaMAtCrsg,405680,406880,it's a combination of video based
umCaMAtCrsg,406880,409599,experiences honestly video or sorry
umCaMAtCrsg,409599,412319,photo based experiences like 360 photos
umCaMAtCrsg,412319,414880,and fully rendered
umCaMAtCrsg,414880,416800,application environments and
umCaMAtCrsg,416800,418479,interestingly a lot of people think that
umCaMAtCrsg,418479,420240,360 videos are where most people would
umCaMAtCrsg,420240,422479,lean in but we have we have analytics
umCaMAtCrsg,422479,424319,that show exactly what people are doing
umCaMAtCrsg,424319,426560,and we see that the highest adoption the
umCaMAtCrsg,426560,428319,largest amount of time spent in vr is
umCaMAtCrsg,428319,431440,actually on 360 imagery where people are
umCaMAtCrsg,431440,432880,able to be there and just spend a lot of
umCaMAtCrsg,432880,434800,time there and i think you know there's
umCaMAtCrsg,434800,435919,a lot that we could talk about there but
umCaMAtCrsg,435919,437280,i think one of the big reasons is that
umCaMAtCrsg,437280,439520,if you're in a 360 video experience you
umCaMAtCrsg,439520,441520,are limited to the constraints of what
umCaMAtCrsg,441520,443440,is in that video versus if you're in a
umCaMAtCrsg,443440,444720,still environment you're going to spend
umCaMAtCrsg,444720,446960,a lot of time just exploring the
umCaMAtCrsg,446960,448240,environment looking and talking about
umCaMAtCrsg,448240,450160,the things that are happening and it
umCaMAtCrsg,450160,451520,creates so much opportunity for a
umCaMAtCrsg,451520,452720,conversation to happen in those
umCaMAtCrsg,452720,454240,experiences thank you so much for
