QnqpMjeCOhY,24980,28039,[Music]
QnqpMjeCOhY,37120,38879,here's one that's been requested a few
QnqpMjeCOhY,38879,40960,times smackdown two know your role on
QnqpMjeCOhY,40960,43200,playstation one got a story about this
QnqpMjeCOhY,43200,45200,one too all those years ago i had a
QnqpMjeCOhY,45200,48000,modded ps1 that played copied games or a
QnqpMjeCOhY,48000,49600,chipped playstation as they were called
QnqpMjeCOhY,49600,51440,around these neck of the woods and every
QnqpMjeCOhY,51440,53360,copy of smackdown 2 that had been
QnqpMjeCOhY,53360,55520,illegally burned to disc that i got my
QnqpMjeCOhY,55520,57680,hands on didn't get past a certain bet
QnqpMjeCOhY,57680,59440,in season mode there must have been a
QnqpMjeCOhY,59440,61600,huge batch of bad pal copies because
QnqpMjeCOhY,61600,63680,practically everyone i knew who had a
QnqpMjeCOhY,63680,65920,modded playstation had the same problem
QnqpMjeCOhY,65920,67680,that i did though i'm sure it wasn't an
QnqpMjeCOhY,67680,69760,issue for you pirates in the states or
QnqpMjeCOhY,69760,72080,maybe it was i don't know so i had to
QnqpMjeCOhY,72080,74000,actually buy a full retail copy of
QnqpMjeCOhY,74000,76479,smackdown 2 back in the day imagine that
QnqpMjeCOhY,76479,78400,and what an improvement the game was in
QnqpMjeCOhY,78400,80640,comparison to the original smackdown
QnqpMjeCOhY,80640,82080,what you may have forgot though is that
QnqpMjeCOhY,82080,84240,smackdown 2 was released mere months
QnqpMjeCOhY,84240,86400,after the original smackdown one was
QnqpMjeCOhY,86400,88960,released in march 2000 in north america
QnqpMjeCOhY,88960,92000,in april 2000 in europe smackdown 2 was
QnqpMjeCOhY,92000,94159,released in november and december the
QnqpMjeCOhY,94159,96320,same year it makes you think maybe
QnqpMjeCOhY,96320,98240,developer ukes had a lot of ideas for
QnqpMjeCOhY,98240,99439,the first game that didn't get
QnqpMjeCOhY,99439,101759,implemented on time and so those ideas
QnqpMjeCOhY,101759,104240,were brought over to smackdown too maybe
QnqpMjeCOhY,104240,106159,graphically the games do look the same
QnqpMjeCOhY,106159,107920,with the sequel looking a little more
QnqpMjeCOhY,107920,109759,clean in places but overall the
QnqpMjeCOhY,109759,111520,graphical enhancements aren't much to
QnqpMjeCOhY,111520,113600,talk about and the way the game plays is
QnqpMjeCOhY,113600,115600,more or less the same with small tweaks
QnqpMjeCOhY,115600,117600,being made here and there along with
QnqpMjeCOhY,117600,119439,certain animations getting speed
QnqpMjeCOhY,119439,121680,alterations on the surface smackdown
QnqpMjeCOhY,121680,123360,until you know your role looks and plays
QnqpMjeCOhY,123360,125200,pretty much the same but once you begin
QnqpMjeCOhY,125200,126799,digging into the game modes available
QnqpMjeCOhY,126799,128959,along with the roster and the new match
QnqpMjeCOhY,128959,130720,types you'll quickly learn that it's a
QnqpMjeCOhY,130720,132959,worthy successor even if you already own
QnqpMjeCOhY,132959,135360,smackdown one let's get started then and
QnqpMjeCOhY,135360,137360,we'll take a look at smackdown 2 know
QnqpMjeCOhY,137360,141560,your role in today's video
QnqpMjeCOhY,142480,144400,smackdown one received good reviews and
QnqpMjeCOhY,144400,146959,it sold pretty well too it was by far
QnqpMjeCOhY,146959,148800,the most feature-rich wrestling game
QnqpMjeCOhY,148800,150800,available on playstation one and while
QnqpMjeCOhY,150800,153280,it maybe didn't hit the same as the n64
QnqpMjeCOhY,153280,155680,aki wrestling games smackdown was still
QnqpMjeCOhY,155680,157519,pretty enjoyable especially in
QnqpMjeCOhY,157519,160319,multiplayer after wwf war zone and
QnqpMjeCOhY,160319,162319,attitude grapple fans were just happy to
QnqpMjeCOhY,162319,164800,get a wwf game to play it different and
QnqpMjeCOhY,164800,166720,this combined with the word wrestling
QnqpMjeCOhY,166720,168800,federation's success from a television
QnqpMjeCOhY,168800,170640,standpoint during the game's release
QnqpMjeCOhY,170640,173200,ensured the wwf smackdown would be a hot
QnqpMjeCOhY,173200,175840,selling release ux and publisher thq
QnqpMjeCOhY,175840,178159,wasted no time in getting the sequel out
QnqpMjeCOhY,178159,180560,the door as mentioned smackdown 2 looked
QnqpMjeCOhY,180560,182319,and played a lot like its predecessor
QnqpMjeCOhY,182319,184159,and nukes clearly didn't spend a whole
QnqpMjeCOhY,184159,185920,lot of time updating the game engine
QnqpMjeCOhY,185920,188239,either but what fans got here was even
QnqpMjeCOhY,188239,190720,more features and modes jam-packed onto
QnqpMjeCOhY,190720,193280,a single disc and for many smackdown 2
QnqpMjeCOhY,193280,195120,quickly became the essential wrestling
QnqpMjeCOhY,195120,197599,game on sony's playstation console many
QnqpMjeCOhY,197599,199200,would say it wouldn't get any better on
QnqpMjeCOhY,199200,201280,the ps1 after smackdown 2 hit the
QnqpMjeCOhY,201280,203840,shelves and finally after wrestlemania
QnqpMjeCOhY,203840,205760,of the arcade game which i loved by the
QnqpMjeCOhY,205760,208080,way in your house warzone attitude and
QnqpMjeCOhY,208080,210560,the first smackdown game the wwf finally
QnqpMjeCOhY,210560,213440,had a ps1 game that was actually great
QnqpMjeCOhY,213440,215920,not good but great before we dig into
QnqpMjeCOhY,215920,217760,these new game modes and whatnot let me
QnqpMjeCOhY,217760,219519,show you how to play smackdown one and
QnqpMjeCOhY,219519,221360,two because i don't think i went through
QnqpMjeCOhY,221360,223360,this in the original smackdown video
QnqpMjeCOhY,223360,225200,what's great about smackdown one and 2
QnqpMjeCOhY,225200,227680,on ps1 is the fact that it's extremely
QnqpMjeCOhY,227680,230080,accessible in comparison to the n64
QnqpMjeCOhY,230080,231840,wrestling games it's even easier to
QnqpMjeCOhY,231840,233760,control and while some would say it's
QnqpMjeCOhY,233760,236159,maybe too simple and maybe too basic the
QnqpMjeCOhY,236159,238319,easier controls did mean that anyone
QnqpMjeCOhY,238319,240319,could play this thing no one would get
QnqpMjeCOhY,240319,242080,turned off by button combinations or
QnqpMjeCOhY,242080,243599,wondering what a certain button does in
QnqpMjeCOhY,243599,245040,the middle of a match because it all
QnqpMjeCOhY,245040,247680,becomes instinctive after just one bite
QnqpMjeCOhY,247680,249519,the x button or the cross button
QnqpMjeCOhY,249519,251680,performs strikes a different direction
QnqpMjeCOhY,251680,254000,with x gives you a different strike the
QnqpMjeCOhY,254000,255680,circle button with a direction will give
QnqpMjeCOhY,255680,257440,you a grapple move
QnqpMjeCOhY,257440,259120,if your opponent's in a daze state
QnqpMjeCOhY,259120,260639,you'll be able to perform a stronger
QnqpMjeCOhY,260639,262639,grapple move and if you top circle
QnqpMjeCOhY,262639,264320,without a direction you'll perform an
QnqpMjeCOhY,264320,266320,irish whip you can run with the triangle
QnqpMjeCOhY,266320,268080,button and you can follow this up with a
QnqpMjeCOhY,268080,270639,strike or a grapple or you can roll
QnqpMjeCOhY,270639,273040,around jump over and slide under your
QnqpMjeCOhY,273040,274960,opponent the square button will block
QnqpMjeCOhY,274960,276880,and perform counters your finishing
QnqpMjeCOhY,276880,279199,moves are performed with the l1 button
QnqpMjeCOhY,279199,281280,r1 is your action button for picking up
QnqpMjeCOhY,281280,283280,weapons getting in and out of the ring
QnqpMjeCOhY,283280,285199,things like that and honestly that's all
QnqpMjeCOhY,285199,286880,you need to know for smackdown one and
QnqpMjeCOhY,286880,289360,two oh darn circle pins your opponent
QnqpMjeCOhY,289360,291120,you'll probably need to know that too
QnqpMjeCOhY,291120,293600,the ps1 smackdown games without a doubt
QnqpMjeCOhY,293600,296000,are the easiest wwf games to play and
QnqpMjeCOhY,296000,297759,this was part of the game's appeal
QnqpMjeCOhY,297759,299680,anyone could have a go at this and you'd
QnqpMjeCOhY,299680,301360,probably have a tougher time trying to
QnqpMjeCOhY,301360,303280,convince your friends to have that first
QnqpMjeCOhY,303280,305440,game but once they did they got hooked
QnqpMjeCOhY,305440,307600,in just like the rest of us the speed
QnqpMjeCOhY,307600,309919,has been ever so slightly increased too
QnqpMjeCOhY,309919,312000,much aren't very long here and recovery
QnqpMjeCOhY,312000,314000,time for a down superstar is mere
QnqpMjeCOhY,314000,316160,seconds you're constantly fighting in
QnqpMjeCOhY,316160,318080,smackdown 2 and it does feel more like a
QnqpMjeCOhY,318080,320000,fast-paced arcade game at times and not
QnqpMjeCOhY,320000,321680,so much a wrestling game where you put
QnqpMjeCOhY,321680,324240,on long epic encounters but again that
QnqpMjeCOhY,324240,326720,was the appeal wwf fans were probably
QnqpMjeCOhY,326720,328320,getting a little fed up with pressing
QnqpMjeCOhY,328320,330160,forward down up square and axe together
QnqpMjeCOhY,330160,331919,to perform a finishing move and they
QnqpMjeCOhY,331919,334160,just wanted to pick up and play wwf game
QnqpMjeCOhY,334160,336479,with no messing around smackdown 2
QnqpMjeCOhY,336479,339840,definitely provided that
QnqpMjeCOhY,339919,341919,let's look at the roster i'll just go
QnqpMjeCOhY,341919,343199,through it here and you can have a look
QnqpMjeCOhY,343199,345600,for yourself smackdown 1 had 36
QnqpMjeCOhY,345600,347039,wrestlers to choose from whereas
QnqpMjeCOhY,347039,350160,smackdown 2 has 66 wrestlers in total
QnqpMjeCOhY,350160,353199,once everything's been unlocked 68 if we
QnqpMjeCOhY,353199,355360,include two guys who were non-selectable
QnqpMjeCOhY,355360,357360,but still accessible through game shark
QnqpMjeCOhY,357360,359199,codes we'll talk about that in a moment
QnqpMjeCOhY,359199,361600,though the roster here is extremely
QnqpMjeCOhY,361600,364240,similar to wwf no mercy a game that was
QnqpMjeCOhY,364240,367120,released mere dez before smackdown 2 so
QnqpMjeCOhY,367120,369199,yeah november 2000 was a pretty good
QnqpMjeCOhY,369199,371759,month for wwf fans we've got the main
QnqpMjeCOhY,371759,373680,street posse here the hardy boyz
QnqpMjeCOhY,373680,375759,undertaker and keon degeneration x
QnqpMjeCOhY,375759,377840,including sean michaels is an unlockable
QnqpMjeCOhY,377840,379680,character steve blackman's here which is
QnqpMjeCOhY,379680,381759,always a good thing we've got too cool
QnqpMjeCOhY,381759,383680,the mcmahons the stooges the right to
QnqpMjeCOhY,383680,385440,censor the radicals are all accounted
QnqpMjeCOhY,385440,387520,for and we've got a reasonable enough
QnqpMjeCOhY,387520,389600,women's roster too including ivory
QnqpMjeCOhY,389600,392240,jacqueline leda trish chyna and others
QnqpMjeCOhY,392240,393919,getting almost double the roster size
QnqpMjeCOhY,393919,395360,would have been enough to make some fans
QnqpMjeCOhY,395360,397520,buy smackdown 2 without hesitation so
QnqpMjeCOhY,397520,399360,you can't fault the player selection
QnqpMjeCOhY,399360,401600,it's the most impressive wwf roster for
QnqpMjeCOhY,401600,404240,the playstation 1 by far those two
QnqpMjeCOhY,404240,406240,non-selectable wrestlers i mentioned are
QnqpMjeCOhY,406240,408240,ken shamrock in the big show their
QnqpMjeCOhY,408240,410240,models and move sets are still included
QnqpMjeCOhY,410240,411840,on the disc but they can only be
QnqpMjeCOhY,411840,413759,selected after entering a game shark
QnqpMjeCOhY,413759,415360,code shamrock had left the world
QnqpMjeCOhY,415360,417039,wrestling federation while smackdown 2
QnqpMjeCOhY,417039,418960,was in development so yukes were able to
QnqpMjeCOhY,418960,420960,take him out after the request came from
QnqpMjeCOhY,420960,423919,wwf but the big show story is a bit more
QnqpMjeCOhY,423919,426160,interesting paul white was still signed
QnqpMjeCOhY,426160,428319,to the war wrestling federation however
QnqpMjeCOhY,428319,430400,he was sent to developmental territory
QnqpMjeCOhY,430400,432560,ovw to get in shape and improve his
QnqpMjeCOhY,432560,435039,in-ring abilities jim ross the head of
QnqpMjeCOhY,435039,437199,talent relations at the time recently
QnqpMjeCOhY,437199,438880,said he was worried that the athletic
QnqpMjeCOhY,438880,440639,commission wouldn't give shoe a license
QnqpMjeCOhY,440639,442800,to wrestle if he didn't drop some weight
QnqpMjeCOhY,442800,445120,and ross was also concerned about paul's
QnqpMjeCOhY,445120,447280,overall health but it sounds like the
QnqpMjeCOhY,447280,449360,wwf weren't too concerned about the big
QnqpMjeCOhY,449360,451440,show's wallet because paul would receive
QnqpMjeCOhY,451440,453520,no royalties for smackdown 2 because he
QnqpMjeCOhY,453520,455360,was removed from the selectable roster
QnqpMjeCOhY,455360,457759,and hidden away from plain sight still
QnqpMjeCOhY,457759,459680,with emulators and all that stuff it's
QnqpMjeCOhY,459680,461280,pretty easy to get access to both
QnqpMjeCOhY,461280,463360,shamrock and the big show if you really
QnqpMjeCOhY,463360,466719,want to play as those guys
QnqpMjeCOhY,468400,470720,match types then smackdown 2 has quite a
QnqpMjeCOhY,470720,472720,few new additions the hell on a sale
QnqpMjeCOhY,472720,475440,makes its wwf game debut here and yeah
QnqpMjeCOhY,475440,477680,it's primitive but at least it's here
QnqpMjeCOhY,477680,479440,you bust through the sail using these
QnqpMjeCOhY,479440,481440,metal panels and when on top of the cage
QnqpMjeCOhY,481440,483039,you can slam your opponent through the
QnqpMjeCOhY,483039,485280,ceiling the area you've got to do this
QnqpMjeCOhY,485280,487039,is quite small though so you've got to
QnqpMjeCOhY,487039,488560,spend a little time landing your
QnqpMjeCOhY,488560,490800,opponent up another matches are here too
QnqpMjeCOhY,490800,492400,and that title belt hanging from the
QnqpMjeCOhY,492400,494160,ceiling is going to swing around like
QnqpMjeCOhY,494160,496319,crazy it's your job to time your grab
QnqpMjeCOhY,496319,498160,perfectly and leave the match holding
QnqpMjeCOhY,498160,500639,the prize fans could play casket matches
QnqpMjeCOhY,500639,502400,for the first time ever and these are
QnqpMjeCOhY,502400,504240,pretty hilarious to look back on
QnqpMjeCOhY,504240,505919,wrestlers pick up the casket like it's
QnqpMjeCOhY,505919,507919,absolutely nothing and they can even
QnqpMjeCOhY,507919,510080,throw the casket at their opponents all
QnqpMjeCOhY,510080,512240,you gotta do is set the casket down whip
QnqpMjeCOhY,512240,514000,your opponent into it and beat your
QnqpMjeCOhY,514000,516320,opponent up so bad that the lid closes
QnqpMjeCOhY,516320,518719,itself again it's extremely primitive
QnqpMjeCOhY,518719,520959,but at least it's here i do wish though
QnqpMjeCOhY,520959,522800,the 2k would get the finger out and add
QnqpMjeCOhY,522800,524480,things like casket matches and buried
QnqpMjeCOhY,524480,526800,alive matches back into the new games
QnqpMjeCOhY,526800,528320,hardcore and false count anywhere
QnqpMjeCOhY,528320,530160,matches are available but now you can
QnqpMjeCOhY,530160,532080,travel all around the arena while
QnqpMjeCOhY,532080,534000,fighting your opponent there's a ton of
QnqpMjeCOhY,534000,535839,areas you can visit and everything's
QnqpMjeCOhY,535839,537760,linked up meaning you can battle in
QnqpMjeCOhY,537760,539440,every location before bringing your
QnqpMjeCOhY,539440,541279,opponent back to the ring if you choose
QnqpMjeCOhY,541279,543519,to do so and you've also got returning
QnqpMjeCOhY,543519,545839,match types such as cage matches special
QnqpMjeCOhY,545839,548560,referee matches i quit matches and an
QnqpMjeCOhY,548560,550560,assortment of multi-man matches from
QnqpMjeCOhY,550560,553040,tags to triple threats to fill four ways
QnqpMjeCOhY,553040,554959,all of which have additional options and
QnqpMjeCOhY,554959,557120,modifiers gameplay is locked at 30
QnqpMjeCOhY,557120,559440,frames per second but it doesn't dip at
QnqpMjeCOhY,559440,561120,all when more than two guys are in the
QnqpMjeCOhY,561120,563360,ring but the load times can be a bit of
QnqpMjeCOhY,563360,565360,a hassle especially in raw rumble
QnqpMjeCOhY,565360,567440,matches take a look here the next
QnqpMjeCOhY,567440,569360,character to come into the raw rumble
QnqpMjeCOhY,569360,571440,isn't preluded in the background it's
QnqpMjeCOhY,571440,574240,just the way ps1 games were instead the
QnqpMjeCOhY,574240,576000,game completely stops once someone's
QnqpMjeCOhY,576000,577920,been eliminated and the match resumes
QnqpMjeCOhY,577920,579839,once that character has been loaded in
QnqpMjeCOhY,579839,581839,this was way more tolerable back in the
QnqpMjeCOhY,581839,583839,day but when you play the game now it
QnqpMjeCOhY,583839,585760,does get a bit annoying along with
QnqpMjeCOhY,585760,587040,battle royals king of the ring
QnqpMjeCOhY,587040,588399,tournaments and the survival mode
QnqpMjeCOhY,588399,590240,there's also the slobber knocker mode
QnqpMjeCOhY,590240,591920,basically defeat as many guys as
QnqpMjeCOhY,591920,593600,possible within a time limit and put
QnqpMjeCOhY,593600,596959,your name on the leaderboard
QnqpMjeCOhY,598880,600959,creator wrestler modes back in smackdown
QnqpMjeCOhY,600959,602880,2 and this was really when creator
QnqpMjeCOhY,602880,605839,wrestler got good for wwf fans last time
QnqpMjeCOhY,605839,607600,around you were choosing from templates
QnqpMjeCOhY,607600,609360,really and using parts unlocked in
QnqpMjeCOhY,609360,610880,season mode there wasn't much
QnqpMjeCOhY,610880,613360,customization available smackdown 2 on
QnqpMjeCOhY,613360,615040,the other hand gives fans a ton of
QnqpMjeCOhY,615040,616959,options and lots of parts to edit with
QnqpMjeCOhY,616959,618480,for the first time ever really and
QnqpMjeCOhY,618480,620480,players could now create wrestlers that
QnqpMjeCOhY,620480,622160,looked at least a little similar to
QnqpMjeCOhY,622160,623839,other superstars not featured in the
QnqpMjeCOhY,623839,625600,game don't worry about this guy i
QnqpMjeCOhY,625600,627360,created i don't know what the [ __ ] i was
QnqpMjeCOhY,627360,629120,doing here it's still nothing compared
QnqpMjeCOhY,629120,630880,to what we would get in subsequent games
QnqpMjeCOhY,630880,633200,but back then this was quite a lot and
QnqpMjeCOhY,633200,635200,creator wrestler also lets us see what's
QnqpMjeCOhY,635200,637200,going on under the hood and season mode
QnqpMjeCOhY,637200,639120,in terms of how relationships work and
QnqpMjeCOhY,639120,641040,how likely it is that a wrestler will
QnqpMjeCOhY,641040,643279,perform in a certain match type you can
QnqpMjeCOhY,643279,644800,set up relationships and create a
QnqpMjeCOhY,644800,646800,wrestler mode who does your wrestler
QnqpMjeCOhY,646800,648880,like and who does your wrestler dislike
QnqpMjeCOhY,648880,650640,you can choose match specialities that
QnqpMjeCOhY,650640,652160,will increase the chances of a certain
QnqpMjeCOhY,652160,654240,superstar winning simulated matchups
QnqpMjeCOhY,654240,656240,depending on the match type and you can
QnqpMjeCOhY,656240,659360,also set stats and cpu logic so there's
QnqpMjeCOhY,659360,661279,quite a bit going on here and for those
QnqpMjeCOhY,661279,663360,who like to meticulously create their
QnqpMjeCOhY,663360,665839,own customized federations with all eyes
QnqpMjeCOhY,665839,668240,foes and individual specialities well
QnqpMjeCOhY,668240,670240,smackdown 2 had you covered before
QnqpMjeCOhY,670240,671760,looking at season mode though there's a
QnqpMjeCOhY,671760,673200,couple of other things i need to show
QnqpMjeCOhY,673200,675200,you create a taunt lets you build a
QnqpMjeCOhY,675200,677120,taunt by selecting two predetermined
QnqpMjeCOhY,677120,679200,animations you'll see some familiar
QnqpMjeCOhY,679200,681040,motions in here such as hulk hogan's
QnqpMjeCOhY,681040,683360,poses and goldberg's jump after he
QnqpMjeCOhY,683360,685680,performs a spear nothing too exciting
QnqpMjeCOhY,685680,687680,but it did give your created superstars
QnqpMjeCOhY,687680,690000,a bit more personality especially if you
QnqpMjeCOhY,690000,691519,were trying to create some real life
QnqpMjeCOhY,691519,694000,superstars from other promotions create
QnqpMjeCOhY,694000,695839,a stable let you create tag teams and
QnqpMjeCOhY,695839,697680,factions you can edit their entrance
QnqpMjeCOhY,697680,699440,music here and edit their entrance
QnqpMjeCOhY,699440,701360,animations create a pay-per-view that
QnqpMjeCOhY,701360,702880,you set up your own events and you'll
QnqpMjeCOhY,702880,704959,get scored on show quality once it's
QnqpMjeCOhY,704959,707279,been completed you can play matches or
QnqpMjeCOhY,707279,709519,simulate matches but the load times can
QnqpMjeCOhY,709519,711519,be a killer here especially when booking
QnqpMjeCOhY,711519,714000,your event it's a fantastic idea though
QnqpMjeCOhY,714000,716480,it's like a very early gm mode create a
QnqpMjeCOhY,716480,718639,manager is also available and this lets
QnqpMjeCOhY,718639,721040,you assign a monitor to any superstar
QnqpMjeCOhY,721040,722880,rankings let you see who the champions
QnqpMjeCOhY,722880,724560,are in your game and who's contending
QnqpMjeCOhY,724560,726880,for the belts though i think my game's
QnqpMjeCOhY,726880,728720,broken the rock's the current woman's
QnqpMjeCOhY,728720,730800,champion and the only person in line for
QnqpMjeCOhY,730800,733440,a title shot is also the rock while all
QnqpMjeCOhY,733440,735360,the ladies plus vince mcmahon are
QnqpMjeCOhY,735360,736959,contending for the light heavyweight
QnqpMjeCOhY,736959,739519,title it's weird
QnqpMjeCOhY,739519,741680,alright let's play season mode in this
QnqpMjeCOhY,741680,743760,mode you'll go through two raw shows two
QnqpMjeCOhY,743760,746079,smackdown shows and a pay-per-view every
QnqpMjeCOhY,746079,748399,month and the mode's gonna last for two
QnqpMjeCOhY,748399,750880,years you pick your superstar i pick the
QnqpMjeCOhY,750880,753040,rock you see the card for the show and
QnqpMjeCOhY,753040,754720,you gotta check to see if you're booked
QnqpMjeCOhY,754720,756560,now regardless if you're booked or not
QnqpMjeCOhY,756560,758320,you're gonna have to simulate every
QnqpMjeCOhY,758320,759600,other match and you're gonna have to
QnqpMjeCOhY,759600,761600,watch these energy bars go down until
QnqpMjeCOhY,761600,763519,someone's named the winner it kinda
QnqpMjeCOhY,763519,765360,reminds me of the old football manager
QnqpMjeCOhY,765360,767839,games the same music plays for every
QnqpMjeCOhY,767839,770160,simulated match and it gets real old
QnqpMjeCOhY,770160,772480,real fast so if you plan on playing this
QnqpMjeCOhY,772480,773839,make sure you've got your own tunes
QnqpMjeCOhY,773839,775600,lined up because hearing the raw theme
QnqpMjeCOhY,775600,777839,the smackdown theme and that simulation
QnqpMjeCOhY,777839,779839,music over and over again is going to
QnqpMjeCOhY,779839,782000,drive you up the wall three [ __ ]
QnqpMjeCOhY,782000,784000,weeks i sat through and i didn't get
QnqpMjeCOhY,784000,786240,booked i'm the rock and paul bear was
QnqpMjeCOhY,786240,788160,getting booked in matches what the hell
QnqpMjeCOhY,788160,790000,and then i remembered the rock's the
QnqpMjeCOhY,790000,791680,current women's champion for whatever
QnqpMjeCOhY,791680,793200,reason and the rock's the only person
QnqpMjeCOhY,793200,795200,contending for the belt i'm not sure if
QnqpMjeCOhY,795200,796800,those game shark codes the unlocked
QnqpMjeCOhY,796800,798880,shamrock and big show messed up my game
QnqpMjeCOhY,798880,801040,so i restarted and i picked steve austin
QnqpMjeCOhY,801040,803200,this time and yeah there we go we've got
QnqpMjeCOhY,803200,805279,a match so what's good here is that you
QnqpMjeCOhY,805279,807040,can see the logic in relationships
QnqpMjeCOhY,807040,808720,working almost right away with the
QnqpMjeCOhY,808720,810720,matches the game's generating match
QnqpMjeCOhY,810720,812800,bookings do make sense not including the
QnqpMjeCOhY,812800,814720,rock holding the women's belt but after
QnqpMjeCOhY,814720,816639,week one i was put in a feud with vince
QnqpMjeCOhY,816639,818560,mcmahon and by week three mcmahon was
QnqpMjeCOhY,818560,820639,attacking me before matches and all that
QnqpMjeCOhY,820639,822480,stuff you're gonna see cutscenes for
QnqpMjeCOhY,822480,824480,other wrestlers too guys wondering who
QnqpMjeCOhY,824480,825680,their opponent's gonna be for the
QnqpMjeCOhY,825680,827920,evening or guys complaining about losing
QnqpMjeCOhY,827920,830079,matches that's all well and good and in
QnqpMjeCOhY,830079,832240,comparison to smackdown one season mode
QnqpMjeCOhY,832240,834480,it's actually pretty awesome this kind
QnqpMjeCOhY,834480,836639,of thing is exactly what wrestling fans
QnqpMjeCOhY,836639,838079,wanted in their single-player
QnqpMjeCOhY,838079,840399,experiences but [ __ ] does it get
QnqpMjeCOhY,840399,842399,repetitive really really fast
QnqpMjeCOhY,842399,844240,it's another step in the right direction
QnqpMjeCOhY,844240,845839,people really like to get immersed in
QnqpMjeCOhY,845839,847360,wrestling games particularly when it
QnqpMjeCOhY,847360,849519,comes to overseeing the whole federation
QnqpMjeCOhY,849519,851680,and that's all good but having to go
QnqpMjeCOhY,851680,853760,through every single match to simulate
QnqpMjeCOhY,853760,855279,the outcome and having to watch
QnqpMjeCOhY,855279,857199,uneventful cutscenes with loading
QnqpMjeCOhY,857199,859360,screens in between becomes a real
QnqpMjeCOhY,859360,861600,[ __ ] drag in practically no time at
QnqpMjeCOhY,861600,863519,all going through this just to capture
QnqpMjeCOhY,863519,865600,this footage was bad enough and i really
QnqpMjeCOhY,865600,867680,couldn't imagine going through over 100
QnqpMjeCOhY,867680,870560,shows just to complete the game nowadays
QnqpMjeCOhY,870560,872720,in saying that though it is different
QnqpMjeCOhY,872720,874160,looking back at things like this
QnqpMjeCOhY,874160,876560,retrospectively back then i loved this
QnqpMjeCOhY,876560,878240,and it didn't bother me half as much as
QnqpMjeCOhY,878240,880399,it does now i even went out and bought
QnqpMjeCOhY,880399,882639,the game after season mode crashed on a
QnqpMjeCOhY,882639,884720,pirated copy so i liked season mode
QnqpMjeCOhY,884720,886320,enough that i would actually buy the
QnqpMjeCOhY,886320,888160,game you know it's unfair to say it's
QnqpMjeCOhY,888160,890160,awful nowadays because back then it
QnqpMjeCOhY,890160,891760,would have been the season mode that
QnqpMjeCOhY,891760,894079,fans had longed for but i can't imagine
QnqpMjeCOhY,894079,895920,anyone wanting to play this now with all
QnqpMjeCOhY,895920,897680,the other offerings we currently have
QnqpMjeCOhY,897680,899839,because smackdown 2 season mode just
QnqpMjeCOhY,899839,902959,drags on and on and on as mentioned
QnqpMjeCOhY,902959,904480,there are other cutscenes in the game
QnqpMjeCOhY,904480,906240,every now and then including stone
QnqpMjeCOhY,906240,908560,co-wrecking the dx express for example
QnqpMjeCOhY,908560,910880,but that's around 30 seconds enjoyment
QnqpMjeCOhY,910880,913199,after sinking in around 16 minutes of
QnqpMjeCOhY,913199,915440,load screens and mod simulations the
QnqpMjeCOhY,915440,917519,character specific cutscenes are few and
QnqpMjeCOhY,917519,919440,far between and it's just not worth
QnqpMjeCOhY,919440,921680,sitting through nod is quite simply
QnqpMjeCOhY,921680,923199,we've been spoiled by the smackdown
QnqpMjeCOhY,923199,925120,games that came after smackdown until
QnqpMjeCOhY,925120,927120,you know your role i must reiterate
QnqpMjeCOhY,927120,929040,though because i'm sure many of you
QnqpMjeCOhY,929040,931120,enjoyed this back in the day like i did
QnqpMjeCOhY,931120,933279,this was great over 20 years ago and we
QnqpMjeCOhY,933279,935199,did have a lot more patience back then
QnqpMjeCOhY,935199,936880,when it came to this kind of thing you
QnqpMjeCOhY,936880,938639,have to appreciate the relationships and
QnqpMjeCOhY,938639,940720,the logic going on in the background and
QnqpMjeCOhY,940720,942639,it's good how much bookings are more or
QnqpMjeCOhY,942639,944560,less on point but if you're looking to
QnqpMjeCOhY,944560,946880,play matches quite consistently season
QnqpMjeCOhY,946880,949040,mode won't be for you you spend more
QnqpMjeCOhY,949040,950880,time in menus than you do playing the
QnqpMjeCOhY,950880,952880,game and if there was just an option to
QnqpMjeCOhY,952880,954720,simulate all matches with one button
QnqpMjeCOhY,954720,956480,press then it would have been a bit more
QnqpMjeCOhY,956480,960160,tolerable in 2022 also i unlocked steve
QnqpMjeCOhY,960160,962560,austin while playing as steve austin
QnqpMjeCOhY,962560,964560,again i think the game shark codes are
QnqpMjeCOhY,964560,966240,causing all sorts of issues here but
QnqpMjeCOhY,966240,967759,regardless you still get to see what
QnqpMjeCOhY,967759,969440,season mode's all about here and
QnqpMjeCOhY,969440,971600,although i may have came off a bit harsh
QnqpMjeCOhY,971600,973360,it may be something that you'd still
QnqpMjeCOhY,973360,975839,enjoy
QnqpMjeCOhY,978160,980000,smackdown two know your roles shined in
QnqpMjeCOhY,980000,982320,multiplayer modes and even today i think
QnqpMjeCOhY,982320,984480,that's where the fun is the fast-paced
QnqpMjeCOhY,984480,986639,arcade style of matchups really are
QnqpMjeCOhY,986639,988320,better when you're playing with friends
QnqpMjeCOhY,988320,989759,and you won't have to think about what
QnqpMjeCOhY,989759,991759,you're doing too much either you can sit
QnqpMjeCOhY,991759,993600,and enjoy a few beers while kicking your
QnqpMjeCOhY,993600,995839,friend's ass because the gameplay really
QnqpMjeCOhY,995839,998639,isn't that deep but it's still enjoyable
QnqpMjeCOhY,998639,1000880,this along with the first smackdown game
QnqpMjeCOhY,1000880,1002880,were the foundations for what was to
QnqpMjeCOhY,1002880,1004959,come though and the ux wrestling engine
QnqpMjeCOhY,1004959,1007040,would keep getting enhanced year after
QnqpMjeCOhY,1007040,1009600,year we have not totally moved on and 2k
QnqpMjeCOhY,1009600,1010959,have developed their own wrestling
QnqpMjeCOhY,1010959,1012560,engine which really came into its own
QnqpMjeCOhY,1012560,1015040,this year with 2k 22 and it's gonna be
QnqpMjeCOhY,1015040,1016720,interesting seeing where that goes in
QnqpMjeCOhY,1016720,1018800,the future but with the old smackdown
QnqpMjeCOhY,1018800,1020480,games that we've been looking at things
QnqpMjeCOhY,1020480,1022079,would only get better when the series
QnqpMjeCOhY,1022079,1024160,moved on to sony's next console the
QnqpMjeCOhY,1024160,1026798,playstation 2. just bring it shut your
QnqpMjeCOhY,1026798,1028079,mouth here comes the pin and the
QnqpMjeCOhY,1028079,1030160,smackdown versus raw series all brought
QnqpMjeCOhY,1030160,1031918,something new to the table with here
QnqpMjeCOhY,1031918,1033839,comes the pain in particular remaining a
QnqpMjeCOhY,1033839,1036319,fan favorite and all these games will
QnqpMjeCOhY,1036319,1038558,get covered on the channel i just have
QnqpMjeCOhY,1038558,1040558,difficulties finding the time really to
QnqpMjeCOhY,1040558,1042798,get reacquainted with these old classics
