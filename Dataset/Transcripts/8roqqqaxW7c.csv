8roqqqaxW7c,1839,4560,homelander on the boys this is going to
8roqqqaxW7c,4560,8000,be a pretty spoiler-ridden recap of
8roqqqaxW7c,8000,10400,certain episodes so if you don't want to
8roqqqaxW7c,10400,12240,have the show spoiled
8roqqqaxW7c,12240,14000,look away block your ears change the
8roqqqaxW7c,14000,15839,channel do whatever you got to do but do
8roqqqaxW7c,15839,19390,not watch the rest of you enjoy
8roqqqaxW7c,19390,23248,[Music]
8roqqqaxW7c,24160,26160,the the show really starts with um
8roqqqaxW7c,26160,28720,pretty incredible piece of guest casting
8roqqqaxW7c,28720,31760,the charlize cameo came about by um
8roqqqaxW7c,31760,34559,following our usual pattern of cameos
8roqqqaxW7c,34559,36719,which is it's the rigorous screening
8roqqqaxW7c,36719,38800,process of whoever returns seth rogen's
8roqqqaxW7c,38800,39840,calls
8roqqqaxW7c,39840,42719,i think she you know talked to
8roqqqaxW7c,42719,44480,seth and evan they just made the long
8roqqqaxW7c,44480,46719,shot together talk about the definition
8roqqqaxW7c,46719,48559,of an incredible sport
8roqqqaxW7c,48559,50399,like she's like yeah i'll do a favor for
8roqqqaxW7c,50399,51760,you and like great because it's going to
8roqqqaxW7c,51760,54480,involve a superhero costume fitting
8roqqqaxW7c,54480,56640,coming out to simi valley for a full day
8roqqqaxW7c,56640,60719,shoot and reading the most ridiculous
8roqqqaxW7c,60719,62480,nazi dialogue
8roqqqaxW7c,62480,63440,ever
8roqqqaxW7c,63440,65600,with a straight face and totally nailing
8roqqqaxW7c,65600,68320,it and um and she was game for all of it
8roqqqaxW7c,68320,71040,so it was it was quite amazing there is
8roqqqaxW7c,71040,73760,uh uh there's actually an extended
8roqqqaxW7c,73760,76000,version of the
8roqqqaxW7c,76000,79360,charlize homelander scene um which will
8roqqqaxW7c,79360,81520,be on amazon x-ray
8roqqqaxW7c,81520,84159,uh when the first episode drops and
8roqqqaxW7c,84159,87200,there's even more ridiculous dialogue
8roqqqaxW7c,87200,90560,that we forced her to do so uh yeah tune
8roqqqaxW7c,90560,91600,in for that
8roqqqaxW7c,91600,94079,sadly we didn't get to we were never in
8roqqqaxW7c,94079,95680,the same spot at the same time we
8roqqqaxW7c,95680,97920,actually she shot her stuff in
8roqqqaxW7c,97920,99200,uh
8roqqqaxW7c,99200,102560,la and and we were up busy in toronto so
8roqqqaxW7c,102560,104640,uh so we were doing our stuff in toronto
8roqqqaxW7c,104640,106640,but you'd never tell when you see it cut
8roqqqaxW7c,106640,107920,together and it's just it's it's
8roqqqaxW7c,107920,110159,hysterical the whole setup and then it
8roqqqaxW7c,110159,112640,you know with homelanders coming in and
8roqqqaxW7c,112640,114159,talking to stormfront and you're sort of
8roqqqaxW7c,114159,115759,wondering what's going on
8roqqqaxW7c,115759,117680,and then turn around and
8roqqqaxW7c,117680,120880,uh the reveal of shelley's is is just
8roqqqaxW7c,120880,122399,hysterical and you know i mean she's
8roqqqaxW7c,122399,124560,such a great actor as well so it's and
8roqqqaxW7c,124560,125840,she looks
8roqqqaxW7c,125840,128560,absurdly beautiful you know she's
8roqqqaxW7c,128560,131599,shelley's throne so it's just such a uh
8roqqqaxW7c,131599,134160,surreal and it's a it's a cracking good
8roqqqaxW7c,134160,136560,opening to the show i thought it was so
8roqqqaxW7c,136560,138800,perfect because i also thought okay so
8roqqqaxW7c,138800,140400,she's being placed
8roqqqaxW7c,140400,141760,in this film
8roqqqaxW7c,141760,144400,that's also kind of a cover-up for the
8roqqqaxW7c,144400,147680,fact that homelander fell for a nazi
8roqqqaxW7c,147680,149280,it's one thing to be in a show with
8roqqqaxW7c,149280,150800,another actor and never meet them
8roqqqaxW7c,150800,152319,because you can have totally separate
8roqqqaxW7c,152319,154720,story lines that happened a lot during
8roqqqaxW7c,154720,156640,season one there were actors who like
8roqqqaxW7c,156640,159680,the boys i would never run into on set i
8roqqqaxW7c,159680,161200,would never see them it was like we were
8roqqqaxW7c,161200,162959,on a different show
8roqqqaxW7c,162959,164959,but this was
8roqqqaxW7c,164959,168720,we were all in the same scene as her and
8roqqqaxW7c,168720,171680,we never have even met her which is wild
8roqqqaxW7c,171680,174239,especially for anthony because he has an
8roqqqaxW7c,174239,176959,entire scene with her
8roqqqaxW7c,176959,179519,but it was hilarious and you know the
8roqqqaxW7c,179519,181440,funny thing is that we come in with
8roqqqaxW7c,181440,183599,these cheesy one-liners
8roqqqaxW7c,183599,186800,that also you know were were not actors
8roqqqaxW7c,186800,189840,were superheroes so we get to
8roqqqaxW7c,189840,192480,deliver them in a cheesier way than we
8roqqqaxW7c,192480,194720,would and to have license to do that is
8roqqqaxW7c,194720,196400,just kind of
8roqqqaxW7c,196400,198879,fun and to satirize like
8roqqqaxW7c,198879,201440,i don't know that whole world of
8roqqqaxW7c,201440,203840,studio films that are
8roqqqaxW7c,203840,205200,you know
8roqqqaxW7c,205200,207519,taking up the box office at this moment
8roqqqaxW7c,207519,209200,but it was great
8roqqqaxW7c,209200,210879,yeah i know it's amazing i mean i saw i
8roqqqaxW7c,210879,212560,just saw doctor strange last week and
8roqqqaxW7c,212560,214480,when that cameo came up at the end i
8roqqqaxW7c,214480,216879,started giggling any time we can sort of
8roqqqaxW7c,216879,218959,inadvertently
8roqqqaxW7c,218959,221040,you know like duplicate what's happening
8roqqqaxW7c,221040,223280,in marvel i'm happy you know at the
8roqqqaxW7c,223280,225920,beginning of season three we find
8roqqqaxW7c,225920,227760,butcher
8roqqqaxW7c,227760,230560,in a pretty frustrated place there is a
8roqqqaxW7c,230560,233920,a real inertia uh that has
8roqqqaxW7c,233920,237120,transpired in his war against the seven
8roqqqaxW7c,237120,239439,and specifically homelander butcher
8roqqqaxW7c,239439,241439,feels like he
8roqqqaxW7c,241439,244239,is the only one who is actually acutely
8roqqqaxW7c,244239,246799,aware of the real position they're in
8roqqqaxW7c,246799,248959,that everybody else is
8roqqqaxW7c,248959,251040,living in some kind of disneyland
8roqqqaxW7c,251040,252879,reality where butcher knows that they're
8roqqqaxW7c,252879,255680,in a fight to the death and uh
8roqqqaxW7c,255680,258079,and and and playing by a set of rules
8roqqqaxW7c,258079,259600,that the other side aren't going to
8roqqqaxW7c,259600,263480,adhere to is not in their best interest
8roqqqaxW7c,263480,289040,[Music]
8roqqqaxW7c,289040,292560,hey there's a scene in episode one
8roqqqaxW7c,292560,294880,kimiko sees
8roqqqaxW7c,294880,297040,someone in at the party playing the
8roqqqaxW7c,297040,299759,piano and she sings
8roqqqaxW7c,299759,302320,and i think that's something uh
8roqqqaxW7c,302320,304639,the viewers will be surprised by because
8roqqqaxW7c,304639,306080,uh it's the first time they're hearing
8roqqqaxW7c,306080,308080,my voice and i'm actually singing
8roqqqaxW7c,308080,311120,um and it is a dream sequence but it's
8roqqqaxW7c,311120,313680,what kimiko wants to be she wants to
8roqqqaxW7c,313680,316000,feel the connection with another human
8roqqqaxW7c,316000,318479,being so badly and communication is such
8roqqqaxW7c,318479,320880,a big part of that and
8roqqqaxW7c,320880,322880,currently she only has she only had it
8roqqqaxW7c,322880,324880,with kenji last season and then now she
8roqqqaxW7c,324880,327360,has it with frenchie but nobody else so
8roqqqaxW7c,327360,329120,that
8roqqqaxW7c,329120,332160,uh piano scene is um her longing
8roqqqaxW7c,332160,334639,to have a friend and her longing to be
8roqqqaxW7c,334639,336320,that girl on
8roqqqaxW7c,336320,338880,playing the piano my recollection is it
8roqqqaxW7c,338880,341840,was uh uh craig rosenberg who brought
8roqqqaxW7c,341840,343759,you such hits as dolphin through the
8roqqqaxW7c,343759,346560,windshield and plunging into the whale
8roqqqaxW7c,346560,347840,brought you
8roqqqaxW7c,347840,350840,um termite running up uh his lover's
8roqqqaxW7c,350840,352560,penis um
8roqqqaxW7c,352560,355039,it's a very natural evolution
8roqqqaxW7c,355039,357280,um by the way because once you realize
8roqqqaxW7c,357280,359039,you're gonna do a tiny
8roqqqaxW7c,359039,361039,ant-man character
8roqqqaxW7c,361039,363680,you have to have that ant-man
8roqqqaxW7c,363680,365440,you know run up someone's butt and then
8roqqqaxW7c,365440,366800,blow them up
8roqqqaxW7c,366800,368960,but then we realized that we already had
8roqqqaxW7c,368960,371440,blown up someone's
8roqqqaxW7c,371440,373199,so it's like there's only so many
8roqqqaxW7c,373199,374400,orifices
8roqqqaxW7c,374400,376240,a person can go in so it's really by
8roqqqaxW7c,376240,378160,process of elimination stayed away from
8roqqqaxW7c,378160,380000,that set i didn't feel like that was
8roqqqaxW7c,380000,383440,something that i needed to uh to see and
8roqqqaxW7c,383440,386160,you know after working on the show for
8roqqqaxW7c,386160,389360,uh two seasons going into third season
8roqqqaxW7c,389360,392360,uh you come to uh build up a certain
8roqqqaxW7c,392360,394479,desensitization to
8roqqqaxW7c,394479,396720,to some of the more graphic content the
8roqqqaxW7c,396720,398720,termite scene is crazy because it
8roqqqaxW7c,398720,401759,happens all in the first 10 minutes of
8roqqqaxW7c,401759,405440,the show i think it's before the credits
8roqqqaxW7c,405440,407280,and
8roqqqaxW7c,407280,409199,when to wear and i read this script we
8roqqqaxW7c,409199,411520,were just kind of blown away
8roqqqaxW7c,411520,413520,at how um how
8roqqqaxW7c,413520,417039,insane of a shot that was going to be
8roqqqaxW7c,417039,419039,they did such a wonderful job of like
8roqqqaxW7c,419039,420960,making it hilarious and also kind of
8roqqqaxW7c,420960,422639,tragic at the same time
8roqqqaxW7c,422639,425280,uh when termite
8roqqqaxW7c,425280,428080,sneezes and he explodes out of uh out of
8roqqqaxW7c,428080,430000,the guy he he has like this look of
8roqqqaxW7c,430000,432160,horror on his face and then frenchie
8roqqqaxW7c,432160,433759,comes in and he's like oh i didn't see
8roqqqaxW7c,433759,436560,anything i'm actually a little shocked
8roqqqaxW7c,436560,437840,how
8roqqqaxW7c,437840,440160,very little feedback we got from amazon
8roqqqaxW7c,440160,442960,on that one on the giant penis i think
8roqqqaxW7c,442960,445599,that i think we've worn them down
8roqqqaxW7c,445599,447599,and they're and they're just exhausted
8roqqqaxW7c,447599,449680,with us so it's like easier to get
8roqqqaxW7c,449680,451280,things through they were totally cool
8roqqqaxW7c,451280,452800,with it i mean
8roqqqaxW7c,452800,455199,the the there's a standards rule which
8roqqqaxW7c,455199,457199,is actually quite amazing of like you
8roqqqaxW7c,457199,459360,know you're not supposed to show an
8roqqqaxW7c,459360,461120,erect penis
8roqqqaxW7c,461120,463360,so we had to be very careful with the
8roqqqaxW7c,463360,465360,design of the penis penis because we
8roqqqaxW7c,465360,467120,built it practically that's a real
8roqqqaxW7c,467120,470319,that's an 11 foot high 30 foot long
8roqqqaxW7c,470319,472800,penis built at great expense
8roqqqaxW7c,472800,475440,but if you look at it we had to design
8roqqqaxW7c,475440,478319,in all these wrinkles
8roqqqaxW7c,478319,481680,to make it clear that it wasn't erect so
8roqqqaxW7c,481680,484680,so anyway it's exhibit
8roqqqaxW7c,484680,487360,7023 why i love this job just the man
8roqqqaxW7c,487360,489680,who fell for the wrong woman uh for the
8roqqqaxW7c,489680,492879,wrong woman but out of
8roqqqaxW7c,498560,500560,i am very excited for everyone to meet
8roqqqaxW7c,500560,503039,the real me
8roqqqaxW7c,503039,506080,there is something wrong with homelander
8roqqqaxW7c,506080,508000,yeah homelanders mental state at the
8roqqqaxW7c,508000,512080,start of season three is is not good and
8roqqqaxW7c,512080,514800,i guess considering homelanders
8roqqqaxW7c,514800,517518,uh mental state generally is not very
8roqqqaxW7c,517518,519360,good it's a it's it's a pretty it's he's
8roqqqaxW7c,519360,521360,in a pretty bad place in season one pat
8roqqqaxW7c,521360,523919,oswald said anthony starr
8roqqqaxW7c,523919,526240,uh gives a smile like it's a jump scare
8roqqqaxW7c,526240,528560,and that always that always feels that
8roqqqaxW7c,528560,531040,felt like a really apt description at
8roqqqaxW7c,531040,533680,the end of season two he really
8roqqqaxW7c,533680,535519,he really got dethroned i think
8roqqqaxW7c,535519,537519,everyone's he felt very
8roqqqaxW7c,537519,539279,victimized and
8roqqqaxW7c,539279,541839,and ganged up on he lost the love what
8roqqqaxW7c,541839,545279,he perceived as the love of his life and
8roqqqaxW7c,545279,549519,maeve that he's got this very twisted
8roqqqaxW7c,549519,551200,relationship with
8roqqqaxW7c,551200,553279,but but i guess he sees her as an ally
8roqqqaxW7c,553279,554720,still
8roqqqaxW7c,554720,557360,turned on him and cahoots with
8roqqqaxW7c,557360,558880,starlight
8roqqqaxW7c,558880,560399,so he's really on the back foot having
8roqqqaxW7c,560399,562720,to do an apology tour and try and make
8roqqqaxW7c,562720,565040,up some ground for that pesky i went out
8roqqqaxW7c,565040,567440,for an i went out with a nazi
8roqqqaxW7c,567440,569440,thing that's been haunting him for uh
8roqqqaxW7c,569440,571120,well since
8roqqqaxW7c,571120,572240,since
8roqqqaxW7c,572240,573680,the end of season two which was a year
8roqqqaxW7c,573680,575120,before of course
8roqqqaxW7c,575120,577680,so he's in a really bad spot on the back
8roqqqaxW7c,577680,580480,foot and um
8roqqqaxW7c,580480,582240,desperately trying to claw his way to
8roqqqaxW7c,582240,584640,get some status back and really get back
8roqqqaxW7c,584640,585839,on his feet
8roqqqaxW7c,585839,589120,uh and then the delightful stan edgar
8roqqqaxW7c,589120,592160,presents a pretty big obstacle in that
8roqqqaxW7c,592160,594160,respect by by making starlight the
8roqqqaxW7c,594160,595360,co-captain
8roqqqaxW7c,595360,598000,uh of the seven with him and that's
8roqqqaxW7c,598000,600320,something he never expected i don't have
8roqqqaxW7c,600320,602399,to tell you that our brand has been a
8roqqqaxW7c,602399,605360,bit tarnished since that nasty business
8roqqqaxW7c,605360,608320,last year but you have restored a
8roqqqaxW7c,608320,609360,wholesome
8roqqqaxW7c,609360,611360,trustworthy image to the company when we
8roqqqaxW7c,611360,613040,needed it the most which is why the
8roqqqaxW7c,613040,614240,board
8roqqqaxW7c,614240,615240,wants to make you
8roqqqaxW7c,615240,616399,[Music]
8roqqqaxW7c,616399,620160,co-captain of the seven what
8roqqqaxW7c,621440,622720,co-captain
8roqqqaxW7c,622720,625360,my reaction to that moment when i read
8roqqqaxW7c,625360,628000,it in the script was this is gonna be
8roqqqaxW7c,628000,630560,fun because first of all i thought okay
8roqqqaxW7c,630560,633519,starlight is in for it because obviously
8roqqqaxW7c,633519,636399,homelander encompasses one of the
8roqqqaxW7c,636399,638480,concepts that we've drilled into this
8roqqqaxW7c,638480,641360,show which is that power corrupts and
8roqqqaxW7c,641360,643360,it's corrupted him and he's gotten drunk
8roqqqaxW7c,643360,646320,on it and he's taken advantage of it and
8roqqqaxW7c,646320,651120,so my increase in power he sees as a
8roqqqaxW7c,651120,654399,threat to his own power and so while
8roqqqaxW7c,654399,657680,initially i take it as an opportunity to
8roqqqaxW7c,657680,660880,to uh you know maybe potentially seize
8roqqqaxW7c,660880,663839,more control in vaught maybe change
8roqqqaxW7c,663839,665680,things up a little bit maybe do some
8roqqqaxW7c,665680,666480,good
8roqqqaxW7c,666480,669279,you know i i really wanted homelander
8roqqqaxW7c,669279,670640,to
8roqqqaxW7c,670640,672160,feel like
8roqqqaxW7c,672160,674959,to borrow a metaphor from butcher scenes
8roqqqaxW7c,674959,677519,like a steam kettle starting to boil
8roqqqaxW7c,677519,679120,you know the most powerful man on the
8roqqqaxW7c,679120,681279,planet and he's like completely feels
8roqqqaxW7c,681279,683519,victimized all the time like
8roqqqaxW7c,683519,685440,certain former presidents
8roqqqaxW7c,685440,687519,but he finds a way to to turn it around
8roqqqaxW7c,687519,689760,you know that that old saying of keep
8roqqqaxW7c,689760,691519,your friends close and your enemies
8roqqqaxW7c,691519,692560,closer
8roqqqaxW7c,692560,694640,uh really rings true and so he flips it
8roqqqaxW7c,694640,696480,into a positive for himself and thinks
8roqqqaxW7c,696480,698000,right well
8roqqqaxW7c,698000,699760,if you're going to be right next to me
8roqqqaxW7c,699760,701519,then i'm going to
8roqqqaxW7c,701519,703120,make it the most uncomfortable
8roqqqaxW7c,703120,704240,experience
8roqqqaxW7c,704240,705680,of your
8roqqqaxW7c,705680,707680,potentially short life
8roqqqaxW7c,707680,710560,i realize i can't really do that because
8roqqqaxW7c,710560,711760,it has
8roqqqaxW7c,711760,712800,um
8roqqqaxW7c,712800,715440,ignited him and angered and provoked him
8roqqqaxW7c,715440,717040,so much
8roqqqaxW7c,717040,719600,that he's just manipulating me
8roqqqaxW7c,719600,722079,constantly has me under his thumb
8roqqqaxW7c,722079,724160,and i kind of feel at any moment he's
8roqqqaxW7c,724160,725920,about to laser me
8roqqqaxW7c,725920,727839,so it's a kind of be careful what you
8roqqqaxW7c,727839,729519,wish for a moment
8roqqqaxW7c,729519,731279,no i didn't i didn't tell aya at the end
8roqqqaxW7c,731279,732959,of season two she'd be coming back i
8roqqqaxW7c,732959,734480,think um
8roqqqaxW7c,734480,736480,we had to still sort of figure it out i
8roqqqaxW7c,736480,738560,mean we we very intentionally left her
8roqqqaxW7c,738560,740399,alive and wanted her
8roqqqaxW7c,740399,744079,to be a player in there you know um one
8roqqqaxW7c,744079,745600,way or another i'm not sure we totally
8roqqqaxW7c,745600,748480,knew how yet um but she's the best and
8roqqqaxW7c,748480,750880,you know i i i'd bring her back you know
8roqqqaxW7c,750880,752639,just to hang out with her
8roqqqaxW7c,752639,754320,yeah that's what that that's been the
8roqqqaxW7c,754320,756160,toughest i've been like oh
8roqqqaxW7c,756160,757040,no i
8roqqqaxW7c,757040,759680,having to stop myself revealing that
8roqqqaxW7c,759680,761519,because um
8roqqqaxW7c,761519,764720,it's such a funny little uh
8roqqqaxW7c,764720,766639,cameo should we call it
8roqqqaxW7c,766639,769200,uh it's it's one of the stranger cameos
8roqqqaxW7c,769200,770560,that you'll see
8roqqqaxW7c,770560,774079,uh i think on television basically she's
8roqqqaxW7c,774079,776160,i've been keeping her a little bit like
8roqqqaxW7c,776160,778720,boxing helena remember that movie um but
8roqqqaxW7c,778720,780480,she's basically
8roqqqaxW7c,780480,782079,she hasn't got any legs anymore she's
8roqqqaxW7c,782079,784839,got one good arm
8roqqqaxW7c,784839,791200,which she and i have found a way to use
8roqqqaxW7c,791200,794480,to uh release home release home lenders
8roqqqaxW7c,794480,795600,tensions
8roqqqaxW7c,795600,797920,uh which we do
8roqqqaxW7c,797920,799600,on screen and it's
8roqqqaxW7c,799600,801120,it was actually one of the funniest days
8roqqqaxW7c,801120,802800,i've had shooting because
8roqqqaxW7c,802800,805040,they got a prosthetic
8roqqqaxW7c,805040,807360,in in place for her to use
8roqqqaxW7c,807360,808320,uh
8roqqqaxW7c,808320,810560,to get the motion
8roqqqaxW7c,810560,812160,right
8roqqqaxW7c,812160,814560,but i couldn't i kept laughing i could
8roqqqaxW7c,814560,816320,have kept breaking because it was i kept
8roqqqaxW7c,816320,818240,looking down and i couldn't look down so
8roqqqaxW7c,818240,820000,i was looking up and then
8roqqqaxW7c,820000,822160,and unable to look at what was going oh
8roqqqaxW7c,822160,824079,it was just so ridiculous the whole
8roqqqaxW7c,824079,826160,thing is so absurd but
8roqqqaxW7c,826160,828399,um you know
8roqqqaxW7c,828399,830880,it just goes to show what a
8roqqqaxW7c,830880,832959,beautiful deep connection they really
8roqqqaxW7c,832959,833760,had
8roqqqaxW7c,833760,837279,i think the nice thing about miles um
8roqqqaxW7c,837279,838959,i think the nice thing about him coming
8roqqqaxW7c,838959,840240,into
8roqqqaxW7c,840240,843440,the mix is that he represents
8roqqqaxW7c,843440,846320,the old annie and while i think that um
8roqqqaxW7c,846320,848399,the old annie to me
8roqqqaxW7c,848399,850240,is
8roqqqaxW7c,850240,851680,honestly
8roqqqaxW7c,851680,853760,fraught with lies because obviously my
8roqqqaxW7c,853760,855199,upbringing
8roqqqaxW7c,855199,858079,or what i believe to be my upbringing
8roqqqaxW7c,858079,859760,was
8roqqqaxW7c,859760,862320,totally dishonest in terms of what my
8roqqqaxW7c,862320,863839,mother told me and how i got my
8roqqqaxW7c,863839,865360,superpowers and
8roqqqaxW7c,865360,867680,the abandonment of my father but
8roqqqaxW7c,867680,868639,but
8roqqqaxW7c,868639,871040,i think that it's always nice to have
8roqqqaxW7c,871040,872160,someone
8roqqqaxW7c,872160,874399,enter your life who knows you from
8roqqqaxW7c,874399,875920,before
8roqqqaxW7c,875920,879040,any type of notoriety or popularity or
8roqqqaxW7c,879040,882480,celebrity happened and i think that
8roqqqaxW7c,882480,884320,that's a reprieve for her to have
8roqqqaxW7c,884320,886720,someone from her hometown that knows the
8roqqqaxW7c,886720,888880,old annie you know and i think that
8roqqqaxW7c,888880,891120,while she did go through uh
8roqqqaxW7c,891120,893040,an identity crisis
8roqqqaxW7c,893040,894880,when she found out that her mom had lied
8roqqqaxW7c,894880,896480,to her um
8roqqqaxW7c,896480,899199,all of her life i think at the same time
8roqqqaxW7c,899199,901519,that old annie to a certain degree is
8roqqqaxW7c,901519,905199,her true self she's trying to be
8roqqqaxW7c,905199,907519,that old annie while also being the
8roqqqaxW7c,907519,910160,newly evolved annie and i think that he
8roqqqaxW7c,910160,911760,makes her feel
8roqqqaxW7c,911760,913680,a little safer in this chaotic
8roqqqaxW7c,913680,916680,environment
8roqqqaxW7c,918870,925899,[Music]
8roqqqaxW7c,932720,934720,i really wanted to shoot a fight scene
8roqqqaxW7c,934720,938800,um this season and we spent about
8roqqqaxW7c,938800,941600,six weeks uh choreographing that fight
8roqqqaxW7c,941600,944079,so we came in every every week or so for
8roqqqaxW7c,944079,946160,a couple of hours and we rolled around
8roqqqaxW7c,946160,949040,on the floor um uh struggling and it was
8roqqqaxW7c,949040,952079,amazing and the entire team uh led by
8roqqqaxW7c,952079,955040,john kayama was just phenomenal and i
8roqqqaxW7c,955040,956560,had so much fun doing it i mean the
8roqqqaxW7c,956560,958880,actual night of the shoot i'm used to
8roqqqaxW7c,958880,960079,having blood on
8roqqqaxW7c,960079,961759,on me
8roqqqaxW7c,961759,963600,on this show now so i'm like that was
8roqqqaxW7c,963600,966720,nothing but we were very much
8roqqqaxW7c,966720,968560,uh rolling around on the floor and a lot
8roqqqaxW7c,968560,969440,of like
8roqqqaxW7c,969440,971519,fake blood was reaching my hair and so
8roqqqaxW7c,971519,973920,that at the end of that evening i was i
8roqqqaxW7c,973920,976480,left set with just like
8roqqqaxW7c,976480,979600,chunks of my hair ripped out of my head
8roqqqaxW7c,979600,981519,which all grew back on us and it looks
8roqqqaxW7c,981519,983759,great it was great but that was a
8roqqqaxW7c,983759,986000,that was an intense night temp v doesn't
8roqqqaxW7c,986000,988320,exist in the comic actually
8roqqqaxW7c,988320,990639,in the comic the boys really from the
8roqqqaxW7c,990639,991759,beginning
8roqqqaxW7c,991759,993759,like just all shoot up
8roqqqaxW7c,993759,997680,compound v and they're just superheroes
8roqqqaxW7c,997680,999120,and
8roqqqaxW7c,999120,1000560,seth evan and i
8roqqqaxW7c,1000560,1002639,really from day one
8roqqqaxW7c,1002639,1004399,one of the first choices we made was
8roqqqaxW7c,1004399,1007279,that we didn't want to do that because i
8roqqqaxW7c,1007279,1008959,think it takes something away from the
8roqqqaxW7c,1008959,1010399,underdog
8roqqqaxW7c,1010399,1011519,you know
8roqqqaxW7c,1011519,1013839,thing of of these like guys who are
8roqqqaxW7c,1013839,1015360,completely
8roqqqaxW7c,1015360,1018000,outmatched by literally super powered
8roqqqaxW7c,1018000,1019680,individuals but you have to figure out
8roqqqaxW7c,1019680,1022240,how to bring them down with your wits
8roqqqaxW7c,1022240,1025438,and we never wanted to lose that and so
8roqqqaxW7c,1025438,1026558,you know
8roqqqaxW7c,1026558,1028880,it was time to you know
8roqqqaxW7c,1028880,1031520,nod to that storyline in the comic in in
8roqqqaxW7c,1031520,1033280,in season three
8roqqqaxW7c,1033280,1036160,um but i you know i did it with a lot of
8roqqqaxW7c,1036160,1038480,handwringing i was worried i you know i
8roqqqaxW7c,1038480,1040000,i was like i don't
8roqqqaxW7c,1040000,1043438,i'm really nervous about you know
8roqqqaxW7c,1043438,1046240,with the dna of the show
8roqqqaxW7c,1046240,1047120,um
8roqqqaxW7c,1047120,1049520,and so through a lot of conversation we
8roqqqaxW7c,1049520,1051360,sort of landed on this
8roqqqaxW7c,1051360,1053120,you know temporary
8roqqqaxW7c,1053120,1055840,compound v that has its own side effects
8roqqqaxW7c,1055840,1058240,and is really unstable and
8roqqqaxW7c,1058240,1061440,you know costs so much to
8roqqqaxW7c,1061440,1064559,emotionally and physically to use it
8roqqqaxW7c,1064559,1066320,so then we could get into once we
8roqqqaxW7c,1066320,1067679,started talking about it as a drug
8roqqqaxW7c,1067679,1070240,metaphor and like a heroin metaphor
8roqqqaxW7c,1070240,1072080,and that i had an escape hatch that i
8roqqqaxW7c,1072080,1074400,could i could make them normal again
8roqqqaxW7c,1074400,1075840,when i needed it
8roqqqaxW7c,1075840,1077600,um you know then i kind of came around
8roqqqaxW7c,1077600,1078960,to the idea we had this really
8roqqqaxW7c,1078960,1081679,interesting scene take shape where
8roqqqaxW7c,1081679,1083600,where these guys that really hate each
8roqqqaxW7c,1083600,1086799,other but ultimately in a very twisted
8roqqqaxW7c,1086799,1088640,way
8roqqqaxW7c,1088640,1089520,uh
8roqqqaxW7c,1089520,1091039,very much need each other they're both
8roqqqaxW7c,1091039,1092480,at the bottom
8roqqqaxW7c,1092480,1093840,they're both on the bottom rung of their
8roqqqaxW7c,1093840,1095280,own personal ladders and they really
8roqqqaxW7c,1095280,1097360,need each other and just got those beats
8roqqqaxW7c,1097360,1099679,before of like you know carl really
8roqqqaxW7c,1099679,1101919,butcher really playing
8roqqqaxW7c,1101919,1104240,uh playing it cool even though he's got
8roqqqaxW7c,1104240,1106000,he's just hidden this
8roqqqaxW7c,1106000,1108559,v this uh temp v so he's actually
8roqqqaxW7c,1108559,1111280,bricking it but he's uh he's playing it
8roqqqaxW7c,1111280,1112640,cool and
8roqqqaxW7c,1112640,1114160,you can see homeland is sort of looking
8roqqqaxW7c,1114160,1116880,around at the hole that he's living in
8roqqqaxW7c,1116880,1118640,wow he's really
8roqqqaxW7c,1118640,1120799,he's really fallen from grace he's
8roqqqaxW7c,1120799,1123120,really you know he's really in a bad
8roqqqaxW7c,1123120,1125039,spot which i don't think he anticipated
8roqqqaxW7c,1125039,1126559,he had a hunch but
8roqqqaxW7c,1126559,1127520,seeing
8roqqqaxW7c,1127520,1128799,is believing you know there's going to
8roqqqaxW7c,1128799,1131600,be one of them left standing uh and you
8roqqqaxW7c,1131600,1133360,know again i just i just love the fact
8roqqqaxW7c,1133360,1135120,that everybody else is happy in the show
8roqqqaxW7c,1135120,1138000,but homelander and butcher and the fact
8roqqqaxW7c,1138000,1141200,that they conspire to uh
8roqqqaxW7c,1141200,1143600,to shake up the world and get things
8roqqqaxW7c,1143600,1145919,back on that a more chaotic track i just
8roqqqaxW7c,1145919,1148960,love that so he's very aware that he's
8roqqqaxW7c,1148960,1152000,he's getting squeezed and pushed into it
8roqqqaxW7c,1152000,1153520,into
8roqqqaxW7c,1153520,1155520,a corner and the only way out of that
8roqqqaxW7c,1155520,1158160,corner bizarrely for both of them
8roqqqaxW7c,1158160,1160640,is with william

8roqqqaxW7c,1166080,1168080,very interesting little chat where they
8roqqqaxW7c,1168080,1169760,they kind of make a death pact i'll
8roqqqaxW7c,1169760,1172320,inspire you you inspire me

8roqqqaxW7c,1193679,1195679,becomes a driving force
8roqqqaxW7c,1195679,1198200,for the season
