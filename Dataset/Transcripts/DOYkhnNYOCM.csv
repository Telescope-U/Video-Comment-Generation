DOYkhnNYOCM,0,2123,[mallet tapping] [mixer buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,2123,3670,[upbeat music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,3670,6040,"- Hi, I'm Scotty and I'm a level one chef."
DOYkhnNYOCM,6040,8210,"- Hi, I'm Anthony and I'm a level two chef."
DOYkhnNYOCM,8210,10559,- I'm Frank Proto and I've been a professional chef
DOYkhnNYOCM,10560,12201,for 27 years.
DOYkhnNYOCM,12201,14270,[upbeat music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,14270,15930,- I love ice cream sandwiches
DOYkhnNYOCM,15930,18440,"because the cookies, the ice cream,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,18440,20530,putting 'em together is like the ultimate snack.
DOYkhnNYOCM,20530,23200,- An ice cream sandwich I think is a delicate balance
DOYkhnNYOCM,23200,26120,between creamy ice cream and a nice stiff
DOYkhnNYOCM,26120,28440,but also crunchy cookie on the outside.
DOYkhnNYOCM,28440,30750,- This ice cream sandwich pretty much encapsulates
DOYkhnNYOCM,30750,32300,"all the flavors that I love,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,32300,35710,"bananas, caramel, fudge, chocolate."
DOYkhnNYOCM,37859,40359,[tense music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,42579,43412,[upbeat music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,43412,45309,- Today I will be using store bought cookies 'n cream
DOYkhnNYOCM,45310,48140,ice cream because Oreos are my favorite cookie.
DOYkhnNYOCM,48140,50130,- So I'm making vanilla bean ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,50130,52180,I'm choosing to do no cook ice cream
DOYkhnNYOCM,52180,54050,just because it's been a busy week for me
DOYkhnNYOCM,54050,56670,and I'd like to make the things as easy as possible.
DOYkhnNYOCM,56670,59629,- I'm making a caramelized banana and fudge ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,59630,61490,I'm choosing to do a custard method
DOYkhnNYOCM,61490,64680,which is basically I'm gonna cook my cream and milk
DOYkhnNYOCM,64680,66270,and then I'm gonna cook my eggs with it.
DOYkhnNYOCM,66270,68382,First thing I'm gonna do is get my vanilla bean
DOYkhnNYOCM,68383,70730,and I'm gonna cut it straight down the middle.
DOYkhnNYOCM,70730,72540,"- Oh, almost and now I'm just running my knife"
DOYkhnNYOCM,72540,76020,down the inside to help pull off all these vanilla seeds.
DOYkhnNYOCM,76020,78680,- The rest of the vanilla pod goes into the cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,78680,81837,I'm going to add my milk and my cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,81837,83170,- And I'm gonna add the sugar.
DOYkhnNYOCM,83170,85299,I love the simplicity of this recipe.
DOYkhnNYOCM,85300,86133,This is it.
DOYkhnNYOCM,86133,88700,No eggs were harmed in the making of this ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,88700,90560,- You can make ice cream without eggs.
DOYkhnNYOCM,90560,92700,"The custard just tends to be a little richer,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,92700,93890,a little more velvety.
DOYkhnNYOCM,93890,95220,"So while that's getting hot,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,95220,99490,I'm gonna add my sugar and my egg yolks to the mixer.
DOYkhnNYOCM,99490,102040,- I have not ever made ice cream from scratch.
DOYkhnNYOCM,102040,103700,I feel like just the thought of it
DOYkhnNYOCM,103700,104869,makes me a little nervous.
DOYkhnNYOCM,104870,107180,- I'm heating the milk until it comes to a light simmer
DOYkhnNYOCM,107180,110330,and then I'm going to temper the milk into the eggs.
DOYkhnNYOCM,110330,113090,- Tempering sounds like making sure something
DOYkhnNYOCM,113090,114340,is the right temperature.
DOYkhnNYOCM,114340,116579,- Tempering basically means heating the egg yolks
DOYkhnNYOCM,116580,119040,and sugar up slowly so they don't cuddle
DOYkhnNYOCM,119040,120840,when they go back in the pot with the cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,120840,122979,So we're gonna go back into the pot and we're gonna let
DOYkhnNYOCM,122980,125460,the custard finish cooking and thicken up.
DOYkhnNYOCM,125460,128270,The next step will be to strain this.
DOYkhnNYOCM,128270,129390,Now that I've made the custard
DOYkhnNYOCM,129390,130640,I'm gonna let it chill completely
DOYkhnNYOCM,130640,131810,and once it's chilled completely
DOYkhnNYOCM,131810,133340,we can spin it in the ice cream maker.
DOYkhnNYOCM,133340,135220,"- All right, so I'm gonna let this steep in the fridge"
DOYkhnNYOCM,135220,137280,for about two hours to help pull out
DOYkhnNYOCM,137280,138480,all that vanilla flavor.
DOYkhnNYOCM,139730,140562,- Look at that.
DOYkhnNYOCM,140563,142460,Go ahead with your ice cream scooper.
DOYkhnNYOCM,142460,144070,So I like using an ice cream scooper
DOYkhnNYOCM,144070,147340,because I've broken a lot of spoons.
DOYkhnNYOCM,147340,149690,This is so much easier than making my own ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,149690,152470,- The next part from my ice cream is the bananas
DOYkhnNYOCM,152470,153950,and these are basically gonna get mixed
DOYkhnNYOCM,153950,155459,into my custard base.
DOYkhnNYOCM,155460,158100,I'm gonna heat my sugar up until it starts to melt.
DOYkhnNYOCM,158100,161890,"As it melts, it goes from sweeter, it starts to caramelize"
DOYkhnNYOCM,161890,163860,and then it starts to get a little bit of bitterness
DOYkhnNYOCM,163860,165920,as it gets browner and that bitterness
DOYkhnNYOCM,165920,168030,is a great counterpoint to the sweetness.
DOYkhnNYOCM,168030,169080,We can add our cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,172118,173277,I'm just gonna whisk that in.
DOYkhnNYOCM,173277,175027,I'm gonna add my Brandy now as well
DOYkhnNYOCM,176640,178840,and a nice hefty pinch of salt.
DOYkhnNYOCM,178840,181593,"So now we have that nice caramel, my bananas can go in."
DOYkhnNYOCM,182890,185180,"Now, the bananas are kind of part of the caramel"
DOYkhnNYOCM,185180,187200,and it's all one and that's what I want.
DOYkhnNYOCM,187200,190319,"I need this to chill completely, at least two hours"
DOYkhnNYOCM,190320,193200,because if it goes into our ice cream and it's warm
DOYkhnNYOCM,193200,194209,it's not gonna freeze right.
DOYkhnNYOCM,194210,196810,"You know, as a chef, we tend to overcomplicate things."
DOYkhnNYOCM,196810,197860,So what am I doing?
DOYkhnNYOCM,197860,199400,I'm making fudge as well.
DOYkhnNYOCM,199400,203159,"It's basically taking some coffee, some corn syrup,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,203160,206910,"some sugar, some cocoa powder and some vanilla"
DOYkhnNYOCM,206910,208550,and just cooking it until it gets
DOYkhnNYOCM,208550,211780,a nice glossy fudgey consistency.
DOYkhnNYOCM,211780,215330,I'm gonna let this fudge chill until it's completely cold.
DOYkhnNYOCM,215330,217420,"- All right, now that my ice cream has chilled in the fridge"
DOYkhnNYOCM,217420,219970,I went ahead and pulled out the vanilla bean chunks.
DOYkhnNYOCM,219970,223480,It's got a freezing cold base in here that will end up
DOYkhnNYOCM,223480,225730,freezing the ice cream and it starts churn it
DOYkhnNYOCM,225730,227400,so that way it kind of chills down
DOYkhnNYOCM,227400,228890,and freezes at an even rate
DOYkhnNYOCM,228890,230760,and now I can add this to the ice cream machine.
DOYkhnNYOCM,230760,232887,It's so simple to use.
DOYkhnNYOCM,232887,235209,[ice cream machine buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,235210,236377,"Shh, easy now."
DOYkhnNYOCM,237220,239660,- My caramelized bananas and my ice cream base
DOYkhnNYOCM,239660,242010,are fully chilled and I'm gonna puree them up
DOYkhnNYOCM,242010,243310,so they're fully combined.
DOYkhnNYOCM,244455,246950,[blender buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,246950,248599,I'm gonna put this in.
DOYkhnNYOCM,248600,252270,This is a home version of a commercial ice cream machine.
DOYkhnNYOCM,252270,254830,It has the chilling mechanism inside.
DOYkhnNYOCM,254830,258200,A lot of times people will use the bowl that freezes
DOYkhnNYOCM,258200,261370,and then you spin it but this machine does the freezing
DOYkhnNYOCM,261370,264453,and the spinning and it's all contained in one.
DOYkhnNYOCM,265330,267849,I'm gonna let this spin until the custard becomes
DOYkhnNYOCM,267850,270030,like a soft serve ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,270030,272340,- Now that my ice cream's been churning for about 20 minutes
DOYkhnNYOCM,272340,275120,it's at the perfect soft survey kind of consistency
DOYkhnNYOCM,275120,277229,to transfer to a container.
DOYkhnNYOCM,277230,279520,So now I'm gonna let this freeze until it firms up.
DOYkhnNYOCM,279520,281009,- There we go.
DOYkhnNYOCM,281010,283300,- My ice cream's been churning for a little over an hour.
DOYkhnNYOCM,283300,286449,Now what I'm gonna do is take my fudge
DOYkhnNYOCM,286450,288850,and swirl it into my ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,288850,291990,Now I'm gonna freeze this until it's firm and scoopable.
DOYkhnNYOCM,291990,293389,- So now I'm gonna work on the cookies.
DOYkhnNYOCM,293390,296270,I am making a classic chocolate chip cookie
DOYkhnNYOCM,296270,297650,with store bought cookie dough.
DOYkhnNYOCM,297650,299669,Chocolate chip cookies are my favorite cookie
DOYkhnNYOCM,299670,302870,even though I did just say Oreos were my favorite cookie.
DOYkhnNYOCM,302870,305470,- I'm going with a brown butter cookie for two reasons.
DOYkhnNYOCM,305470,308270,"One, because it's gonna give me a nice crunch"
DOYkhnNYOCM,308270,311460,"and two, that brown butter flavor is gonna compliment"
DOYkhnNYOCM,311460,314310,the vanilla bean ice cream perfectly.
DOYkhnNYOCM,314310,315940,"- And what I'm gonna use is pizzelle,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,315940,318870,a small crispy Italian waffle.
DOYkhnNYOCM,318870,321070,I had just had these with my father
DOYkhnNYOCM,321070,323440,"and I'm like, ""This would make a great ice cream sandwich."""
DOYkhnNYOCM,323440,325970,I'm gonna add sugar and espresso powder.
DOYkhnNYOCM,325970,327770,The espresso will give the chocolate
DOYkhnNYOCM,327770,329220,a more chocolatey flavor.
DOYkhnNYOCM,329220,332560,- A very light spray of cooking spray on the pan.
DOYkhnNYOCM,332560,334750,"So I'm gonna make these cookies by taking a spoon,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,334750,337860,"scooping out a perfect amount, little rolling process,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,337860,339580,doesn't have to be a perfect circle.
DOYkhnNYOCM,339580,341900,- Just gonna add my flour to my bowl.
DOYkhnNYOCM,341900,345070,"Next, my baking soda, baking powder and my kosher salt."
DOYkhnNYOCM,345070,347161,- So I'm gonna add my eggs in
DOYkhnNYOCM,347161,348050,and I'm just gonna turn it on and let it go.
DOYkhnNYOCM,348050,349669,- I'm just gonna give it a whisk
DOYkhnNYOCM,349670,352163,to distribute everything nice and evenly.
DOYkhnNYOCM,353060,354810,- I'm gonna add just the pinch of salt right now
DOYkhnNYOCM,354810,356419,and I'm adding my cocoa powder.
DOYkhnNYOCM,356420,358200,- This is just regular butter that I cooked
DOYkhnNYOCM,358200,359900,over medium heat until it was brown.
DOYkhnNYOCM,359900,361449,The brown butter is gonna add a nice
DOYkhnNYOCM,361450,363690,kind of toffee-ish type flavor.
DOYkhnNYOCM,363690,365040,My light brown sugar.
DOYkhnNYOCM,365040,366825,- And my baking powder.
DOYkhnNYOCM,366825,369400,[mixers buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,369400,370688,- Cool.
DOYkhnNYOCM,370688,371521,- [Frank] I'm gonna add my butter.
DOYkhnNYOCM,371521,373520,"- My egg, my egg yolk, my almond extract"
DOYkhnNYOCM,373520,374910,and my vanilla extract.
DOYkhnNYOCM,374910,376453,- [Frank] We'll add our flour.
DOYkhnNYOCM,378120,380050,- So my batter is pretty well mixed.
DOYkhnNYOCM,380050,382020,I'm just gonna start pulling off small chunks
DOYkhnNYOCM,382020,383889,to roll in our sugar because I like
DOYkhnNYOCM,383890,385610,that little extra bit of sweetness
DOYkhnNYOCM,385610,387669,and the nice kind of crunch that you get on the outside.
DOYkhnNYOCM,387670,390690,- What I'm gonna do is just flatten 'em out just to tad
DOYkhnNYOCM,390690,393170,and I will put it down on our tray.
DOYkhnNYOCM,393170,395300,"- Now that I have the batter made for the cookies,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,395300,397740,I'm going to put it into this pizzelle iron.
DOYkhnNYOCM,397740,400039,"Basically, it's just a smaller waffle iron"
DOYkhnNYOCM,400040,401920,that's gonna make a nice thin cookie
DOYkhnNYOCM,401920,404110,rather than a thick deep waffle.
DOYkhnNYOCM,404110,405509,Just push them down a little
DOYkhnNYOCM,406370,408100,and then I'm gonna clamp it closed.
DOYkhnNYOCM,408100,410440,Squeeze it shut.
DOYkhnNYOCM,410440,413000,"I think I put too much in, holy cow."
DOYkhnNYOCM,413000,415970,"- Preheat the oven to 350, bake 12 to 13 minutes"
DOYkhnNYOCM,415970,417270,or until golden brown.
DOYkhnNYOCM,417270,418639,"All right, that's what I'm gonna do."
DOYkhnNYOCM,418640,420180,- Now I'm gonna let my cookies bake in the oven
DOYkhnNYOCM,420180,421423,for about 14 minutes.
DOYkhnNYOCM,422480,424400,"- All right, so you can see that the cookie"
DOYkhnNYOCM,424400,425820,is starting to brown a little.
DOYkhnNYOCM,425820,426810,It's still a little soft.
DOYkhnNYOCM,426810,428770,I'm gonna put it on my tray to chill.
DOYkhnNYOCM,428770,432069,As they chill they'll start to harden and that's what I want
DOYkhnNYOCM,432070,433730,for my finished cookie.
DOYkhnNYOCM,433730,436100,"- Nice, they came out perfect."
DOYkhnNYOCM,436100,437393,- These are huge.
DOYkhnNYOCM,438700,440440,- And now I'm gonna work on my toppings.
DOYkhnNYOCM,440440,442600,I'm working with Magic Shell Chocolate
DOYkhnNYOCM,442600,444270,and crushed Oreo cookies.
DOYkhnNYOCM,444270,446270,- I'm gonna be making candied pistachios.
DOYkhnNYOCM,446270,448139,"I love that it brings a crispy, crunchy texture"
DOYkhnNYOCM,448140,449200,to the ice cream sandwich.
DOYkhnNYOCM,449200,451220,- The topping I'm making from ice cream sandwich
DOYkhnNYOCM,451220,452440,is a peanut praline.
DOYkhnNYOCM,452440,456720,"I think that peanuts, banana and fudge go great together."
DOYkhnNYOCM,456720,459340,- Magic Shell Chocolate is chocolate
DOYkhnNYOCM,459340,460930,that freezes in seconds.
DOYkhnNYOCM,460930,462850,It changed the way I look at ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,462850,466040,I will make sure I shake this extremely well.
DOYkhnNYOCM,466040,468050,I'm gonna go ahead and pour it into the bowl
DOYkhnNYOCM,468050,470370,to make the dipping process easier.
DOYkhnNYOCM,470370,472790,- I'm gonna add the pistachio nuts and the sugar to the pan
DOYkhnNYOCM,472790,476770,over about medium heat until the sugar starts to caramelize
DOYkhnNYOCM,476770,479009,and the pistachios get just a little bit toasted.
DOYkhnNYOCM,479010,481250,"- To make the praline, I'm gonna cook some sugar,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,481250,484090,"I'm gonna add my cream, my baking soda."
DOYkhnNYOCM,484090,486699,"The baking soda's gonna add a little lightness,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,486700,487533,a little airiness.
DOYkhnNYOCM,487533,490190,I'm cooking this sugar mixture to 240 degrees
DOYkhnNYOCM,490190,492530,which is right before the hardball stage
DOYkhnNYOCM,492530,495420,which means that the sugar is firm enough
DOYkhnNYOCM,495420,497040,that it's gonna hold its shape
DOYkhnNYOCM,497040,499400,but it's also gonna break fairly easily.
DOYkhnNYOCM,499400,501090,- So now that my pistachios are toasted
DOYkhnNYOCM,501090,503030,"and the sugar is sticking to the nuts,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,503030,504280,I'm gonna add a little bit of salt
DOYkhnNYOCM,504280,505940,and add just a pinch of cayenne.
DOYkhnNYOCM,505940,507230,Just a little bit of heat.
DOYkhnNYOCM,507230,510240,"My candied pistachios are gonna be just a little bit sweet,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,510240,512979,"a little salty, a little crunchy"
DOYkhnNYOCM,512979,514949,and then a little tiny bit spicy.
DOYkhnNYOCM,514950,518550,- I am going to add my vanilla and my butter.
DOYkhnNYOCM,518550,520919,Try not to splash it on yourself and stir.
DOYkhnNYOCM,520919,524950,"Once those are mixed in peanuts, go in, mix"
DOYkhnNYOCM,524950,527370,and I'm gonna go right onto a Sil-Pad
DOYkhnNYOCM,527370,529529,which is a non-stick silicone pad.
DOYkhnNYOCM,529530,531170,I'm gonna let this chill on the counter.
DOYkhnNYOCM,531170,532670,I'm not gonna put it in the fridge.
DOYkhnNYOCM,532670,534790,You get a lot of moisture from the refrigerator
DOYkhnNYOCM,534790,535980,and I don't want to get that moisture.
DOYkhnNYOCM,535980,538209,I'm just gonna let it chill until it's cool enough
DOYkhnNYOCM,538210,539800,to break up into little pieces.
DOYkhnNYOCM,539800,543963,- So I'm going to grab about six cookies to start.
DOYkhnNYOCM,544820,547123,"I'll put it in the bag, close it up good."
DOYkhnNYOCM,548650,552230,So I'm crushing them up and I will pour them in my bowl
DOYkhnNYOCM,552230,553410,for easier use.
DOYkhnNYOCM,553410,554940,"- Now that my peanut praline is cool,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,554940,556500,I'm gonna throw it in the food processor
DOYkhnNYOCM,556500,558394,and just give it a quick blitz.
DOYkhnNYOCM,558394,560500,[food processor buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,560500,562920,- So now it's time to build my ice cream sandwiches.
DOYkhnNYOCM,562920,565339,"So I got my cookie, I'll come in here,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,565340,568260,grab my choice scoop of ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,568260,571220,So I have to make sure it's the perfect size.
DOYkhnNYOCM,571220,573529,- And then just very gently press down on it.
DOYkhnNYOCM,573530,574930,- Not gonna push the cookie down
DOYkhnNYOCM,574930,576390,'cause the cookie will crack.
DOYkhnNYOCM,576390,578900,- Make sure it's lined up.
DOYkhnNYOCM,578900,581810,- Now I'm applying even pressure to the entire cookie.
DOYkhnNYOCM,581810,583050,- And just kind of mush it together.
DOYkhnNYOCM,583050,586459,Nice and easy and I'm just gonna roll it in my praline
DOYkhnNYOCM,586460,588290,to get it all along the edges.
DOYkhnNYOCM,588290,589570,Make sure it sticks.
DOYkhnNYOCM,589570,592410,"- So with the Magic Shell, I'm just gonna roll the edges"
DOYkhnNYOCM,592410,594899,of the ice cream sandwich in the shell
DOYkhnNYOCM,594900,598190,"and then straight from there, right into the Oreos."
DOYkhnNYOCM,598190,600320,- Position the sandwich completely vertically
DOYkhnNYOCM,600320,601607,and then roll.
DOYkhnNYOCM,601607,603580,- And now I will plate my sandwiches
DOYkhnNYOCM,603580,606493,to make them look as delicious as possible.
DOYkhnNYOCM,607410,608660,- Plating is simple for this.
DOYkhnNYOCM,608660,609910,All I really have to do is take one
DOYkhnNYOCM,609910,611829,of my sandwiches and put it there.
DOYkhnNYOCM,611830,613170,Look at that.
DOYkhnNYOCM,613170,615399,- And these are my ice cream sandwiches.
DOYkhnNYOCM,615400,617180,- This is my vanilla ice cream sandwich
DOYkhnNYOCM,617180,620580,on a brown butter cookie with candied pistachios.
DOYkhnNYOCM,620580,623850,- This is my caramelized banana and fudge ice cream sandwich
DOYkhnNYOCM,623850,626100,with a chocolate pizzelle and peanut praline.
DOYkhnNYOCM,626956,629539,[upbeat music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,632180,634339,"- I'm excited to try this, I really am."
DOYkhnNYOCM,634340,636790,"- Everything about this sandwich screams eat me,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,636790,638430,eat me really fast.
DOYkhnNYOCM,638430,639430,Get me in your belly.
DOYkhnNYOCM,639430,641440,- I'm pretty impressed with myself
DOYkhnNYOCM,641440,642790,for having pulled this off.
DOYkhnNYOCM,646420,648490,"- The ice cream, obviously delicious,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,648490,651817,"the Magic Shell with the Oreos, you might think,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,651817,653260,"""Oh, too much chocolate."""
DOYkhnNYOCM,653260,654710,Never enough chocolate.
DOYkhnNYOCM,654710,657090,- That flavor combination is incredible.
DOYkhnNYOCM,657090,660110,"The vanilla with the pistachios, the candied."
DOYkhnNYOCM,660110,662610,"Oh, so good, that brown butter comes through in the end."
DOYkhnNYOCM,662610,665350,- This is everything I dreamed it would be and more.
DOYkhnNYOCM,665350,667509,"Some guys have fantasy football,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,667510,669720,I have fantasy ice cream sandwiches.
DOYkhnNYOCM,669720,673092,This wins in every single draft in the world.
DOYkhnNYOCM,675710,678340,- Ice cream sandwiches are something everyone can love.
DOYkhnNYOCM,678340,679920,There are so many options.
DOYkhnNYOCM,679920,682378,Let's see how each of our chefs made theirs.
DOYkhnNYOCM,682378,685399,[tense music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,685400,687470,Scotty used store bought ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,687470,690069,Commercial ice creams usually have emulsifiers
DOYkhnNYOCM,690070,692890,added to keep all of the various components together
DOYkhnNYOCM,692890,695020,in one cold creamy mixture.
DOYkhnNYOCM,695020,698300,You'll see proteins or starch based plant gums
DOYkhnNYOCM,698300,701339,or algae based polysaccharides added.
DOYkhnNYOCM,701340,703410,All ice cream has some air added
DOYkhnNYOCM,703410,705129,as part of the churning process.
DOYkhnNYOCM,705130,708320,Without the air you would have a block of sweetened cream
DOYkhnNYOCM,708320,710740,that would be really hard to scoop and eat.
DOYkhnNYOCM,710740,713500,Anthony made one of the two main types of ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,713500,717210,His was a no cook ice cream base also known as a standard
DOYkhnNYOCM,717210,719080,or Philadelphia style ice cream
DOYkhnNYOCM,719080,722420,and it's made simply with milk cream and sugar as the base.
DOYkhnNYOCM,722420,725399,Frank made the other style of ice cream called custard
DOYkhnNYOCM,725400,728040,or French style ice cream which includes egg yolks.
DOYkhnNYOCM,728040,731269,"Egg yolks contain lecithin, phosphatidylcholine"
DOYkhnNYOCM,731270,733750,and proteins that act as the emulsifiers
DOYkhnNYOCM,733750,736400,"for the base of his milk, cream and sugar."
DOYkhnNYOCM,736400,739960,"Because egg yolks coagulate at a relatively low temperature,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,739960,742200,"around 155 degrees Fahrenheit,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,742200,744410,"Frank needed to temper his eggs,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,744410,746940,making a custard style ice cream like Frank did
DOYkhnNYOCM,746940,748870,requires a lot of technique
DOYkhnNYOCM,748870,751826,and is definitely a level three elevation.
DOYkhnNYOCM,751826,754950,[tense music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,754950,756910,Frank made chocolate pizzelles.
DOYkhnNYOCM,756910,759480,Pizzelles are cooked by conduction which means
DOYkhnNYOCM,759480,761889,that the hot griddle comes in direct contact
DOYkhnNYOCM,761890,764620,"with the batter, both on top and bottom,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,764620,767730,transferring heat directly molecule to molecule
DOYkhnNYOCM,767730,771769,"from the griddle to the batter, making them thin and crispy."
DOYkhnNYOCM,771770,773810,- [Frank] This would make a great ice cream sandwich.
DOYkhnNYOCM,773810,776810,- The batter is dehydrated which then allows browning
DOYkhnNYOCM,776810,779800,"reactions to progress between the starches, sugars"
DOYkhnNYOCM,779800,780839,and proteins.
DOYkhnNYOCM,780840,783810,"When baking cookies in the oven like Scotty and Anthony did,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,783810,787000,the bottom of the cookie is quickly baked by conduction.
DOYkhnNYOCM,787000,790210,"However, the top is baked by waves of radiant energy"
DOYkhnNYOCM,790210,792310,"that travel through the air, heating it,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,792310,794610,that originates from a heating element in the oven.
DOYkhnNYOCM,794610,797600,It's why the tops are softer and dome shaped
DOYkhnNYOCM,797600,800756,and the bottoms are dark and crispy.
DOYkhnNYOCM,800757,803550,[tense music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,803550,806430,Scotty dipped his sandwich in Magic Shell Chocolate.
DOYkhnNYOCM,806430,809089,The magic of this product is that it contains
DOYkhnNYOCM,809090,812430,"alkalized cocoa, milk and emulsifiers like lecithin"
DOYkhnNYOCM,812430,814860,combined with coconut and sunflower oil
DOYkhnNYOCM,814860,817760,that hardens one cold like when it's poured on ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,817760,820160,Anthony toasted pistachios and sugar.
DOYkhnNYOCM,820160,823110,Pistachios contains small amounts of free sugars
DOYkhnNYOCM,823110,824800,making them noticeably sweet.
DOYkhnNYOCM,824800,825690,- Why are they green?
DOYkhnNYOCM,825690,827030,It doesn't make any sense to me.
DOYkhnNYOCM,827030,829640,- These nuts are partially green from chlorophyll
DOYkhnNYOCM,829640,831300,which makes them pretty too.
DOYkhnNYOCM,831300,834529,Frank made handmade praline by first caramelizing sugar
DOYkhnNYOCM,834530,838600,to 240 degrees Fahrenheit which is the soft ball stage
DOYkhnNYOCM,838600,841180,so named because if you drop some of the sugar
DOYkhnNYOCM,841180,843390,at this temperature into cold water
DOYkhnNYOCM,843390,845900,it forms balls that are only lightly colored
DOYkhnNYOCM,845900,847580,and still soft and pliable.
DOYkhnNYOCM,847580,850480,Ice cream sandwiches aren't just a summertime snack.
DOYkhnNYOCM,850480,852440,They're wonderful all year long.
DOYkhnNYOCM,852440,854600,Next time you are in the mood for a sweet treat
DOYkhnNYOCM,854600,856380,we hope you'll take some of these tips
DOYkhnNYOCM,856380,858733,from our three wonderful chefs.

DOYkhnNYOCM,0,2123,[mallet tapping] [mixer buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,2123,3670,[upbeat music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,3670,6040,"- Hi, I'm Scotty and I'm a level one chef."
DOYkhnNYOCM,6040,8210,"- Hi, I'm Anthony and I'm a level two chef."
DOYkhnNYOCM,8210,10559,- I'm Frank Proto and I've been a professional chef
DOYkhnNYOCM,10560,12201,for 27 years.
DOYkhnNYOCM,12201,14270,[upbeat music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,14270,15930,- I love ice cream sandwiches
DOYkhnNYOCM,15930,18440,"because the cookies, the ice cream,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,18440,20530,putting 'em together is like the ultimate snack.
DOYkhnNYOCM,20530,23200,- An ice cream sandwich I think is a delicate balance
DOYkhnNYOCM,23200,26120,between creamy ice cream and a nice stiff
DOYkhnNYOCM,26120,28440,but also crunchy cookie on the outside.
DOYkhnNYOCM,28440,30750,- This ice cream sandwich pretty much encapsulates
DOYkhnNYOCM,30750,32300,"all the flavors that I love,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,32300,35710,"bananas, caramel, fudge, chocolate."
DOYkhnNYOCM,37859,40359,[tense music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,42579,43412,[upbeat music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,43412,45309,- Today I will be using store bought cookies 'n cream
DOYkhnNYOCM,45310,48140,ice cream because Oreos are my favorite cookie.
DOYkhnNYOCM,48140,50130,- So I'm making vanilla bean ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,50130,52180,I'm choosing to do no cook ice cream
DOYkhnNYOCM,52180,54050,just because it's been a busy week for me
DOYkhnNYOCM,54050,56670,and I'd like to make the things as easy as possible.
DOYkhnNYOCM,56670,59629,- I'm making a caramelized banana and fudge ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,59630,61490,I'm choosing to do a custard method
DOYkhnNYOCM,61490,64680,which is basically I'm gonna cook my cream and milk
DOYkhnNYOCM,64680,66270,and then I'm gonna cook my eggs with it.
DOYkhnNYOCM,66270,68382,First thing I'm gonna do is get my vanilla bean
DOYkhnNYOCM,68383,70730,and I'm gonna cut it straight down the middle.
DOYkhnNYOCM,70730,72540,"- Oh, almost and now I'm just running my knife"
DOYkhnNYOCM,72540,76020,down the inside to help pull off all these vanilla seeds.
DOYkhnNYOCM,76020,78680,- The rest of the vanilla pod goes into the cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,78680,81837,I'm going to add my milk and my cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,81837,83170,- And I'm gonna add the sugar.
DOYkhnNYOCM,83170,85299,I love the simplicity of this recipe.
DOYkhnNYOCM,85300,86133,This is it.
DOYkhnNYOCM,86133,88700,No eggs were harmed in the making of this ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,88700,90560,- You can make ice cream without eggs.
DOYkhnNYOCM,90560,92700,"The custard just tends to be a little richer,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,92700,93890,a little more velvety.
DOYkhnNYOCM,93890,95220,"So while that's getting hot,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,95220,99490,I'm gonna add my sugar and my egg yolks to the mixer.
DOYkhnNYOCM,99490,102040,- I have not ever made ice cream from scratch.
DOYkhnNYOCM,102040,103700,I feel like just the thought of it
DOYkhnNYOCM,103700,104869,makes me a little nervous.
DOYkhnNYOCM,104870,107180,- I'm heating the milk until it comes to a light simmer
DOYkhnNYOCM,107180,110330,and then I'm going to temper the milk into the eggs.
DOYkhnNYOCM,110330,113090,- Tempering sounds like making sure something
DOYkhnNYOCM,113090,114340,is the right temperature.
DOYkhnNYOCM,114340,116579,- Tempering basically means heating the egg yolks
DOYkhnNYOCM,116580,119040,and sugar up slowly so they don't cuddle
DOYkhnNYOCM,119040,120840,when they go back in the pot with the cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,120840,122979,So we're gonna go back into the pot and we're gonna let
DOYkhnNYOCM,122980,125460,the custard finish cooking and thicken up.
DOYkhnNYOCM,125460,128270,The next step will be to strain this.
DOYkhnNYOCM,128270,129390,Now that I've made the custard
DOYkhnNYOCM,129390,130640,I'm gonna let it chill completely
DOYkhnNYOCM,130640,131810,and once it's chilled completely
DOYkhnNYOCM,131810,133340,we can spin it in the ice cream maker.
DOYkhnNYOCM,133340,135220,"- All right, so I'm gonna let this steep in the fridge"
DOYkhnNYOCM,135220,137280,for about two hours to help pull out
DOYkhnNYOCM,137280,138480,all that vanilla flavor.
DOYkhnNYOCM,139730,140562,- Look at that.
DOYkhnNYOCM,140563,142460,Go ahead with your ice cream scooper.
DOYkhnNYOCM,142460,144070,So I like using an ice cream scooper
DOYkhnNYOCM,144070,147340,because I've broken a lot of spoons.
DOYkhnNYOCM,147340,149690,This is so much easier than making my own ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,149690,152470,- The next part from my ice cream is the bananas
DOYkhnNYOCM,152470,153950,and these are basically gonna get mixed
DOYkhnNYOCM,153950,155459,into my custard base.
DOYkhnNYOCM,155460,158100,I'm gonna heat my sugar up until it starts to melt.
DOYkhnNYOCM,158100,161890,"As it melts, it goes from sweeter, it starts to caramelize"
DOYkhnNYOCM,161890,163860,and then it starts to get a little bit of bitterness
DOYkhnNYOCM,163860,165920,as it gets browner and that bitterness
DOYkhnNYOCM,165920,168030,is a great counterpoint to the sweetness.
DOYkhnNYOCM,168030,169080,We can add our cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,172118,173277,I'm just gonna whisk that in.
DOYkhnNYOCM,173277,175027,I'm gonna add my Brandy now as well
DOYkhnNYOCM,176640,178840,and a nice hefty pinch of salt.
DOYkhnNYOCM,178840,181593,"So now we have that nice caramel, my bananas can go in."
DOYkhnNYOCM,182890,185180,"Now, the bananas are kind of part of the caramel"
DOYkhnNYOCM,185180,187200,and it's all one and that's what I want.
DOYkhnNYOCM,187200,190319,"I need this to chill completely, at least two hours"
DOYkhnNYOCM,190320,193200,because if it goes into our ice cream and it's warm
DOYkhnNYOCM,193200,194209,it's not gonna freeze right.
DOYkhnNYOCM,194210,196810,"You know, as a chef, we tend to overcomplicate things."
DOYkhnNYOCM,196810,197860,So what am I doing?
DOYkhnNYOCM,197860,199400,I'm making fudge as well.
DOYkhnNYOCM,199400,203159,"It's basically taking some coffee, some corn syrup,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,203160,206910,"some sugar, some cocoa powder and some vanilla"
DOYkhnNYOCM,206910,208550,and just cooking it until it gets
DOYkhnNYOCM,208550,211780,a nice glossy fudgey consistency.
DOYkhnNYOCM,211780,215330,I'm gonna let this fudge chill until it's completely cold.
DOYkhnNYOCM,215330,217420,"- All right, now that my ice cream has chilled in the fridge"
DOYkhnNYOCM,217420,219970,I went ahead and pulled out the vanilla bean chunks.
DOYkhnNYOCM,219970,223480,It's got a freezing cold base in here that will end up
DOYkhnNYOCM,223480,225730,freezing the ice cream and it starts churn it
DOYkhnNYOCM,225730,227400,so that way it kind of chills down
DOYkhnNYOCM,227400,228890,and freezes at an even rate
DOYkhnNYOCM,228890,230760,and now I can add this to the ice cream machine.
DOYkhnNYOCM,230760,232887,It's so simple to use.
DOYkhnNYOCM,232887,235209,[ice cream machine buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,235210,236377,"Shh, easy now."
DOYkhnNYOCM,237220,239660,- My caramelized bananas and my ice cream base
DOYkhnNYOCM,239660,242010,are fully chilled and I'm gonna puree them up
DOYkhnNYOCM,242010,243310,so they're fully combined.
DOYkhnNYOCM,244455,246950,[blender buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,246950,248599,I'm gonna put this in.
DOYkhnNYOCM,248600,252270,This is a home version of a commercial ice cream machine.
DOYkhnNYOCM,252270,254830,It has the chilling mechanism inside.
DOYkhnNYOCM,254830,258200,A lot of times people will use the bowl that freezes
DOYkhnNYOCM,258200,261370,and then you spin it but this machine does the freezing
DOYkhnNYOCM,261370,264453,and the spinning and it's all contained in one.
DOYkhnNYOCM,265330,267849,I'm gonna let this spin until the custard becomes
DOYkhnNYOCM,267850,270030,like a soft serve ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,270030,272340,- Now that my ice cream's been churning for about 20 minutes
DOYkhnNYOCM,272340,275120,it's at the perfect soft survey kind of consistency
DOYkhnNYOCM,275120,277229,to transfer to a container.
DOYkhnNYOCM,277230,279520,So now I'm gonna let this freeze until it firms up.
DOYkhnNYOCM,279520,281009,- There we go.
DOYkhnNYOCM,281010,283300,- My ice cream's been churning for a little over an hour.
DOYkhnNYOCM,283300,286449,Now what I'm gonna do is take my fudge
DOYkhnNYOCM,286450,288850,and swirl it into my ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,288850,291990,Now I'm gonna freeze this until it's firm and scoopable.
DOYkhnNYOCM,291990,293389,- So now I'm gonna work on the cookies.
DOYkhnNYOCM,293390,296270,I am making a classic chocolate chip cookie
DOYkhnNYOCM,296270,297650,with store bought cookie dough.
DOYkhnNYOCM,297650,299669,Chocolate chip cookies are my favorite cookie
DOYkhnNYOCM,299670,302870,even though I did just say Oreos were my favorite cookie.
DOYkhnNYOCM,302870,305470,- I'm going with a brown butter cookie for two reasons.
DOYkhnNYOCM,305470,308270,"One, because it's gonna give me a nice crunch"
DOYkhnNYOCM,308270,311460,"and two, that brown butter flavor is gonna compliment"
DOYkhnNYOCM,311460,314310,the vanilla bean ice cream perfectly.
DOYkhnNYOCM,314310,315940,"- And what I'm gonna use is pizzelle,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,315940,318870,a small crispy Italian waffle.
DOYkhnNYOCM,318870,321070,I had just had these with my father
DOYkhnNYOCM,321070,323440,"and I'm like, ""This would make a great ice cream sandwich."""
DOYkhnNYOCM,323440,325970,I'm gonna add sugar and espresso powder.
DOYkhnNYOCM,325970,327770,The espresso will give the chocolate
DOYkhnNYOCM,327770,329220,a more chocolatey flavor.
DOYkhnNYOCM,329220,332560,- A very light spray of cooking spray on the pan.
DOYkhnNYOCM,332560,334750,"So I'm gonna make these cookies by taking a spoon,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,334750,337860,"scooping out a perfect amount, little rolling process,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,337860,339580,doesn't have to be a perfect circle.
DOYkhnNYOCM,339580,341900,- Just gonna add my flour to my bowl.
DOYkhnNYOCM,341900,345070,"Next, my baking soda, baking powder and my kosher salt."
DOYkhnNYOCM,345070,347161,- So I'm gonna add my eggs in
DOYkhnNYOCM,347161,348050,and I'm just gonna turn it on and let it go.
DOYkhnNYOCM,348050,349669,- I'm just gonna give it a whisk
DOYkhnNYOCM,349670,352163,to distribute everything nice and evenly.
DOYkhnNYOCM,353060,354810,- I'm gonna add just the pinch of salt right now
DOYkhnNYOCM,354810,356419,and I'm adding my cocoa powder.
DOYkhnNYOCM,356420,358200,- This is just regular butter that I cooked
DOYkhnNYOCM,358200,359900,over medium heat until it was brown.
DOYkhnNYOCM,359900,361449,The brown butter is gonna add a nice
DOYkhnNYOCM,361450,363690,kind of toffee-ish type flavor.
DOYkhnNYOCM,363690,365040,My light brown sugar.
DOYkhnNYOCM,365040,366825,- And my baking powder.
DOYkhnNYOCM,366825,369400,[mixers buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,369400,370688,- Cool.
DOYkhnNYOCM,370688,371521,- [Frank] I'm gonna add my butter.
DOYkhnNYOCM,371521,373520,"- My egg, my egg yolk, my almond extract"
DOYkhnNYOCM,373520,374910,and my vanilla extract.
DOYkhnNYOCM,374910,376453,- [Frank] We'll add our flour.
DOYkhnNYOCM,378120,380050,- So my batter is pretty well mixed.
DOYkhnNYOCM,380050,382020,I'm just gonna start pulling off small chunks
DOYkhnNYOCM,382020,383889,to roll in our sugar because I like
DOYkhnNYOCM,383890,385610,that little extra bit of sweetness
DOYkhnNYOCM,385610,387669,and the nice kind of crunch that you get on the outside.
DOYkhnNYOCM,387670,390690,- What I'm gonna do is just flatten 'em out just to tad
DOYkhnNYOCM,390690,393170,and I will put it down on our tray.
DOYkhnNYOCM,393170,395300,"- Now that I have the batter made for the cookies,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,395300,397740,I'm going to put it into this pizzelle iron.
DOYkhnNYOCM,397740,400039,"Basically, it's just a smaller waffle iron"
DOYkhnNYOCM,400040,401920,that's gonna make a nice thin cookie
DOYkhnNYOCM,401920,404110,rather than a thick deep waffle.
DOYkhnNYOCM,404110,405509,Just push them down a little
DOYkhnNYOCM,406370,408100,and then I'm gonna clamp it closed.
DOYkhnNYOCM,408100,410440,Squeeze it shut.
DOYkhnNYOCM,410440,413000,"I think I put too much in, holy cow."
DOYkhnNYOCM,413000,415970,"- Preheat the oven to 350, bake 12 to 13 minutes"
DOYkhnNYOCM,415970,417270,or until golden brown.
DOYkhnNYOCM,417270,418639,"All right, that's what I'm gonna do."
DOYkhnNYOCM,418640,420180,- Now I'm gonna let my cookies bake in the oven
DOYkhnNYOCM,420180,421423,for about 14 minutes.
DOYkhnNYOCM,422480,424400,"- All right, so you can see that the cookie"
DOYkhnNYOCM,424400,425820,is starting to brown a little.
DOYkhnNYOCM,425820,426810,It's still a little soft.
DOYkhnNYOCM,426810,428770,I'm gonna put it on my tray to chill.
DOYkhnNYOCM,428770,432069,As they chill they'll start to harden and that's what I want
DOYkhnNYOCM,432070,433730,for my finished cookie.
DOYkhnNYOCM,433730,436100,"- Nice, they came out perfect."
DOYkhnNYOCM,436100,437393,- These are huge.
DOYkhnNYOCM,438700,440440,- And now I'm gonna work on my toppings.
DOYkhnNYOCM,440440,442600,I'm working with Magic Shell Chocolate
DOYkhnNYOCM,442600,444270,and crushed Oreo cookies.
DOYkhnNYOCM,444270,446270,- I'm gonna be making candied pistachios.
DOYkhnNYOCM,446270,448139,"I love that it brings a crispy, crunchy texture"
DOYkhnNYOCM,448140,449200,to the ice cream sandwich.
DOYkhnNYOCM,449200,451220,- The topping I'm making from ice cream sandwich
DOYkhnNYOCM,451220,452440,is a peanut praline.
DOYkhnNYOCM,452440,456720,"I think that peanuts, banana and fudge go great together."
DOYkhnNYOCM,456720,459340,- Magic Shell Chocolate is chocolate
DOYkhnNYOCM,459340,460930,that freezes in seconds.
DOYkhnNYOCM,460930,462850,It changed the way I look at ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,462850,466040,I will make sure I shake this extremely well.
DOYkhnNYOCM,466040,468050,I'm gonna go ahead and pour it into the bowl
DOYkhnNYOCM,468050,470370,to make the dipping process easier.
DOYkhnNYOCM,470370,472790,- I'm gonna add the pistachio nuts and the sugar to the pan
DOYkhnNYOCM,472790,476770,over about medium heat until the sugar starts to caramelize
DOYkhnNYOCM,476770,479009,and the pistachios get just a little bit toasted.
DOYkhnNYOCM,479010,481250,"- To make the praline, I'm gonna cook some sugar,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,481250,484090,"I'm gonna add my cream, my baking soda."
DOYkhnNYOCM,484090,486699,"The baking soda's gonna add a little lightness,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,486700,487533,a little airiness.
DOYkhnNYOCM,487533,490190,I'm cooking this sugar mixture to 240 degrees
DOYkhnNYOCM,490190,492530,which is right before the hardball stage
DOYkhnNYOCM,492530,495420,which means that the sugar is firm enough
DOYkhnNYOCM,495420,497040,that it's gonna hold its shape
DOYkhnNYOCM,497040,499400,but it's also gonna break fairly easily.
DOYkhnNYOCM,499400,501090,- So now that my pistachios are toasted
DOYkhnNYOCM,501090,503030,"and the sugar is sticking to the nuts,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,503030,504280,I'm gonna add a little bit of salt
DOYkhnNYOCM,504280,505940,and add just a pinch of cayenne.
DOYkhnNYOCM,505940,507230,Just a little bit of heat.
DOYkhnNYOCM,507230,510240,"My candied pistachios are gonna be just a little bit sweet,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,510240,512979,"a little salty, a little crunchy"
DOYkhnNYOCM,512979,514949,and then a little tiny bit spicy.
DOYkhnNYOCM,514950,518550,- I am going to add my vanilla and my butter.
DOYkhnNYOCM,518550,520919,Try not to splash it on yourself and stir.
DOYkhnNYOCM,520919,524950,"Once those are mixed in peanuts, go in, mix"
DOYkhnNYOCM,524950,527370,and I'm gonna go right onto a Sil-Pad
DOYkhnNYOCM,527370,529529,which is a non-stick silicone pad.
DOYkhnNYOCM,529530,531170,I'm gonna let this chill on the counter.
DOYkhnNYOCM,531170,532670,I'm not gonna put it in the fridge.
DOYkhnNYOCM,532670,534790,You get a lot of moisture from the refrigerator
DOYkhnNYOCM,534790,535980,and I don't want to get that moisture.
DOYkhnNYOCM,535980,538209,I'm just gonna let it chill until it's cool enough
DOYkhnNYOCM,538210,539800,to break up into little pieces.
DOYkhnNYOCM,539800,543963,- So I'm going to grab about six cookies to start.
DOYkhnNYOCM,544820,547123,"I'll put it in the bag, close it up good."
DOYkhnNYOCM,548650,552230,So I'm crushing them up and I will pour them in my bowl
DOYkhnNYOCM,552230,553410,for easier use.
DOYkhnNYOCM,553410,554940,"- Now that my peanut praline is cool,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,554940,556500,I'm gonna throw it in the food processor
DOYkhnNYOCM,556500,558394,and just give it a quick blitz.
DOYkhnNYOCM,558394,560500,[food processor buzzing]
DOYkhnNYOCM,560500,562920,- So now it's time to build my ice cream sandwiches.
DOYkhnNYOCM,562920,565339,"So I got my cookie, I'll come in here,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,565340,568260,grab my choice scoop of ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,568260,571220,So I have to make sure it's the perfect size.
DOYkhnNYOCM,571220,573529,- And then just very gently press down on it.
DOYkhnNYOCM,573530,574930,- Not gonna push the cookie down
DOYkhnNYOCM,574930,576390,'cause the cookie will crack.
DOYkhnNYOCM,576390,578900,- Make sure it's lined up.
DOYkhnNYOCM,578900,581810,- Now I'm applying even pressure to the entire cookie.
DOYkhnNYOCM,581810,583050,- And just kind of mush it together.
DOYkhnNYOCM,583050,586459,Nice and easy and I'm just gonna roll it in my praline
DOYkhnNYOCM,586460,588290,to get it all along the edges.
DOYkhnNYOCM,588290,589570,Make sure it sticks.
DOYkhnNYOCM,589570,592410,"- So with the Magic Shell, I'm just gonna roll the edges"
DOYkhnNYOCM,592410,594899,of the ice cream sandwich in the shell
DOYkhnNYOCM,594900,598190,"and then straight from there, right into the Oreos."
DOYkhnNYOCM,598190,600320,- Position the sandwich completely vertically
DOYkhnNYOCM,600320,601607,and then roll.
DOYkhnNYOCM,601607,603580,- And now I will plate my sandwiches
DOYkhnNYOCM,603580,606493,to make them look as delicious as possible.
DOYkhnNYOCM,607410,608660,- Plating is simple for this.
DOYkhnNYOCM,608660,609910,All I really have to do is take one
DOYkhnNYOCM,609910,611829,of my sandwiches and put it there.
DOYkhnNYOCM,611830,613170,Look at that.
DOYkhnNYOCM,613170,615399,- And these are my ice cream sandwiches.
DOYkhnNYOCM,615400,617180,- This is my vanilla ice cream sandwich
DOYkhnNYOCM,617180,620580,on a brown butter cookie with candied pistachios.
DOYkhnNYOCM,620580,623850,- This is my caramelized banana and fudge ice cream sandwich
DOYkhnNYOCM,623850,626100,with a chocolate pizzelle and peanut praline.
DOYkhnNYOCM,626956,629539,[upbeat music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,632180,634339,"- I'm excited to try this, I really am."
DOYkhnNYOCM,634340,636790,"- Everything about this sandwich screams eat me,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,636790,638430,eat me really fast.
DOYkhnNYOCM,638430,639430,Get me in your belly.
DOYkhnNYOCM,639430,641440,- I'm pretty impressed with myself
DOYkhnNYOCM,641440,642790,for having pulled this off.
DOYkhnNYOCM,646420,648490,"- The ice cream, obviously delicious,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,648490,651817,"the Magic Shell with the Oreos, you might think,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,651817,653260,"""Oh, too much chocolate."""
DOYkhnNYOCM,653260,654710,Never enough chocolate.
DOYkhnNYOCM,654710,657090,- That flavor combination is incredible.
DOYkhnNYOCM,657090,660110,"The vanilla with the pistachios, the candied."
DOYkhnNYOCM,660110,662610,"Oh, so good, that brown butter comes through in the end."
DOYkhnNYOCM,662610,665350,- This is everything I dreamed it would be and more.
DOYkhnNYOCM,665350,667509,"Some guys have fantasy football,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,667510,669720,I have fantasy ice cream sandwiches.
DOYkhnNYOCM,669720,673092,This wins in every single draft in the world.
DOYkhnNYOCM,675710,678340,- Ice cream sandwiches are something everyone can love.
DOYkhnNYOCM,678340,679920,There are so many options.
DOYkhnNYOCM,679920,682378,Let's see how each of our chefs made theirs.
DOYkhnNYOCM,682378,685399,[tense music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,685400,687470,Scotty used store bought ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,687470,690069,Commercial ice creams usually have emulsifiers
DOYkhnNYOCM,690070,692890,added to keep all of the various components together
DOYkhnNYOCM,692890,695020,in one cold creamy mixture.
DOYkhnNYOCM,695020,698300,You'll see proteins or starch based plant gums
DOYkhnNYOCM,698300,701339,or algae based polysaccharides added.
DOYkhnNYOCM,701340,703410,All ice cream has some air added
DOYkhnNYOCM,703410,705129,as part of the churning process.
DOYkhnNYOCM,705130,708320,Without the air you would have a block of sweetened cream
DOYkhnNYOCM,708320,710740,that would be really hard to scoop and eat.
DOYkhnNYOCM,710740,713500,Anthony made one of the two main types of ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,713500,717210,His was a no cook ice cream base also known as a standard
DOYkhnNYOCM,717210,719080,or Philadelphia style ice cream
DOYkhnNYOCM,719080,722420,and it's made simply with milk cream and sugar as the base.
DOYkhnNYOCM,722420,725399,Frank made the other style of ice cream called custard
DOYkhnNYOCM,725400,728040,or French style ice cream which includes egg yolks.
DOYkhnNYOCM,728040,731269,"Egg yolks contain lecithin, phosphatidylcholine"
DOYkhnNYOCM,731270,733750,and proteins that act as the emulsifiers
DOYkhnNYOCM,733750,736400,"for the base of his milk, cream and sugar."
DOYkhnNYOCM,736400,739960,"Because egg yolks coagulate at a relatively low temperature,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,739960,742200,"around 155 degrees Fahrenheit,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,742200,744410,"Frank needed to temper his eggs,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,744410,746940,making a custard style ice cream like Frank did
DOYkhnNYOCM,746940,748870,requires a lot of technique
DOYkhnNYOCM,748870,751826,and is definitely a level three elevation.
DOYkhnNYOCM,751826,754950,[tense music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,754950,756910,Frank made chocolate pizzelles.
DOYkhnNYOCM,756910,759480,Pizzelles are cooked by conduction which means
DOYkhnNYOCM,759480,761889,that the hot griddle comes in direct contact
DOYkhnNYOCM,761890,764620,"with the batter, both on top and bottom,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,764620,767730,transferring heat directly molecule to molecule
DOYkhnNYOCM,767730,771769,"from the griddle to the batter, making them thin and crispy."
DOYkhnNYOCM,771770,773810,- [Frank] This would make a great ice cream sandwich.
DOYkhnNYOCM,773810,776810,- The batter is dehydrated which then allows browning
DOYkhnNYOCM,776810,779800,"reactions to progress between the starches, sugars"
DOYkhnNYOCM,779800,780839,and proteins.
DOYkhnNYOCM,780840,783810,"When baking cookies in the oven like Scotty and Anthony did,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,783810,787000,the bottom of the cookie is quickly baked by conduction.
DOYkhnNYOCM,787000,790210,"However, the top is baked by waves of radiant energy"
DOYkhnNYOCM,790210,792310,"that travel through the air, heating it,"
DOYkhnNYOCM,792310,794610,that originates from a heating element in the oven.
DOYkhnNYOCM,794610,797600,It's why the tops are softer and dome shaped
DOYkhnNYOCM,797600,800756,and the bottoms are dark and crispy.
DOYkhnNYOCM,800757,803550,[tense music]
DOYkhnNYOCM,803550,806430,Scotty dipped his sandwich in Magic Shell Chocolate.
DOYkhnNYOCM,806430,809089,The magic of this product is that it contains
DOYkhnNYOCM,809090,812430,"alkalized cocoa, milk and emulsifiers like lecithin"
DOYkhnNYOCM,812430,814860,combined with coconut and sunflower oil
DOYkhnNYOCM,814860,817760,that hardens one cold like when it's poured on ice cream.
DOYkhnNYOCM,817760,820160,Anthony toasted pistachios and sugar.
DOYkhnNYOCM,820160,823110,Pistachios contains small amounts of free sugars
DOYkhnNYOCM,823110,824800,making them noticeably sweet.
DOYkhnNYOCM,824800,825690,- Why are they green?
DOYkhnNYOCM,825690,827030,It doesn't make any sense to me.
DOYkhnNYOCM,827030,829640,- These nuts are partially green from chlorophyll
DOYkhnNYOCM,829640,831300,which makes them pretty too.
DOYkhnNYOCM,831300,834529,Frank made handmade praline by first caramelizing sugar
DOYkhnNYOCM,834530,838600,to 240 degrees Fahrenheit which is the soft ball stage
DOYkhnNYOCM,838600,841180,so named because if you drop some of the sugar
DOYkhnNYOCM,841180,843390,at this temperature into cold water
DOYkhnNYOCM,843390,845900,it forms balls that are only lightly colored
DOYkhnNYOCM,845900,847580,and still soft and pliable.
DOYkhnNYOCM,847580,850480,Ice cream sandwiches aren't just a summertime snack.
DOYkhnNYOCM,850480,852440,They're wonderful all year long.
DOYkhnNYOCM,852440,854600,Next time you are in the mood for a sweet treat
DOYkhnNYOCM,854600,856380,we hope you'll take some of these tips
DOYkhnNYOCM,856380,858733,from our three wonderful chefs.
