8tiQuiCdbkM,3740,4680,"Greetings, friends!"
8tiQuiCdbkM,4680,7779,"I have made multiple videos on the Indian education system,"
8tiQuiCdbkM,7780,12540,comparing Indian education system with that of German system and the system in  Singapore
8tiQuiCdbkM,12540,14480,and elaborating on the demerits of the Indian system
8tiQuiCdbkM,14480,18980,But my main criticism regarding the Indian education system in all these videos was
8tiQuiCdbkM,18980,22680,Why is our system so poor? What changes can be brought about
8tiQuiCdbkM,22680,24920,and what can we learn from the developed countries?
8tiQuiCdbkM,24920,28180,I have kept reiterating these main points in all these videos
8tiQuiCdbkM,28660,35420,"Today, I am very happy to say that the new education policy that our government has brought in"
8tiQuiCdbkM,35720,40660,They have addressed almost all the major points of criticism in their new policy
8tiQuiCdbkM,40660,44239,and they have brought a revolutionary change in the Indian education system
8tiQuiCdbkM,44500,47200,I'm saying that in a positive step- They've taken a very good step
8tiQuiCdbkM,47480,48440,"Come, let us find out"
8tiQuiCdbkM,52080,54840,One of the first and major points of criticism is that
8tiQuiCdbkM,54840,59700,our educational system tries to fit the students into three categories after class 10
8tiQuiCdbkM,59900,61900,"Science, commerce and humanities"
8tiQuiCdbkM,61900,66420,"And this is very problematic- If you chose one stream, then you cannot study the subjects of the other streams"
8tiQuiCdbkM,66580,69720,"But more often than not, the students are interested in a variety of subjects"
8tiQuiCdbkM,69720,73780,"For example, when I was in the 11th, I chose the science stream but"
8tiQuiCdbkM,73800,76880,my interest also lay in Political science and Economics
8tiQuiCdbkM,76880,82439,"But I was helpless, having opted for the science stream, I could not study subjects like Pol Science and Economics"
8tiQuiCdbkM,82440,83440,What could I have done?
8tiQuiCdbkM,83720,85860,"But now, the government has changed this"
8tiQuiCdbkM,85860,89880,"Now, the students have more flexibility to choose their subjects"
8tiQuiCdbkM,89880,93360,"Upon the implementation of this policy,"
8tiQuiCdbkM,93360,98760,a student can study Political science with Physics and Chemistry with History
8tiQuiCdbkM,99260,103820,"A student can study Science, commerce as well as Arts subjects"
8tiQuiCdbkM,103820,108600,This is an amazing initiative. And I feel jealous as a 90s kid
8tiQuiCdbkM,108740,110740,we were compelled to choose amongst the three
8tiQuiCdbkM,110740,114100,"Now, the students would have so much more flexibility to choose"
8tiQuiCdbkM,114100,119440,A second major change by the government is that they have replaced the existing 10+2 academic structure
8tiQuiCdbkM,119440,123040,with the 5+3+3+4 system now
8tiQuiCdbkM,123040,127100,"Now, it has become more similar to the education system of the western developed countries"
8tiQuiCdbkM,127100,130280,"In the 10+2 system, education began at the age of 6"
8tiQuiCdbkM,130280,132660,"In this new system, education would now start at the age of 3"
8tiQuiCdbkM,132660,138220,Preschool would be from the age of 3-6 and then class 1 and 2 for the next two years
8tiQuiCdbkM,138220,142120,"Then would be the ""preparatory stage"" for the next 3 years in which focus would be upon"
8tiQuiCdbkM,142120,145640,"playing, discovery and activity based classroom learning"
8tiQuiCdbkM,145640,149400,Class 6 to 8 would be the middle stage
8tiQuiCdbkM,149400,151620,in which experiential learning would be focused upon-
8tiQuiCdbkM,151740,154840,"sciences, mathematics, arts, social sciences and humanities"
8tiQuiCdbkM,154840,157780,Next would be the secondary stage of class 9-12
8tiQuiCdbkM,157780,160840,in which multi disciplinary studies would be focused upon
8tiQuiCdbkM,160840,163959,Students would be provided with  ore flexibility and more choices
8tiQuiCdbkM,163960,168380,"The job of selling, or working in a supermarket, or driving..."
8tiQuiCdbkM,168380,170620,"-... plumbing, carpentry"
8tiQuiCdbkM,170880,173620,gardening... all the jobs like these
8tiQuiCdbkM,173620,179080,"that do not come under the proper purview of engineering, humanities or universities"
8tiQuiCdbkM,179080,184060,"All that is viewed on the extra side,  they are vocationally trained upto a large extent"
8tiQuiCdbkM,184060,188840,"- A vast difference is that in India, we view these jobs at a very low level"
8tiQuiCdbkM,188840,193700,We look at things and presume that the people of the lower (caste/class) do these kinds of jobs
8tiQuiCdbkM,193700,199340,"and our parents poke fun and say that if you don't study, will you do carpentry and become a carpenter ?"
8tiQuiCdbkM,199340,200300,or a plumber?
8tiQuiCdbkM,200440,204600,The difference (here) is that these jobs are given the same respect in Germany
8tiQuiCdbkM,204600,210880,I kept reiterating in the previous videos that vocational training is given a lot of importance in developed countries
8tiQuiCdbkM,210880,214500,"The jobs like welding, electrician, carpentry, plumbing"
8tiQuiCdbkM,214500,219320,These jobs are viewed at the same level as the rest of the skilled jobs
8tiQuiCdbkM,219340,226200,"In India, these jobs are looked at with disdain, which is a mindset that needs to change"
8tiQuiCdbkM,226380,232100,"The government has implemented some structural changes to change this mindset, which is praiseworthy"
8tiQuiCdbkM,232100,237340,"for example, right from class 6, students would have to do internships in vocational training jobs"
8tiQuiCdbkM,237340,239519,The students would be imparted experience in such jobs
8tiQuiCdbkM,239520,244180,There would be a bagless period of 10 days- where he students would take no bags to school
8tiQuiCdbkM,244180,248280,"but experience jobs like- carpentry, welding, gardening"
8tiQuiCdbkM,248380,252040,Vocational training in schools would be focused upon even later
8tiQuiCdbkM,252360,256579,"This is a very critical thing without which, in my opinion, we cannot become a developed country"
8tiQuiCdbkM,256579,258239,until and unless these changes are implemented
8tiQuiCdbkM,258579,262079,The government has fortunately taken a step in the right direction regarding this
8tiQuiCdbkM,262079,264939,Coding would be taught to children from class 6
8tiQuiCdbkM,264940,268280,and the importance accorded to board exams in class 10 and 12 would be reduced
8tiQuiCdbkM,268440,273700,Another interesting and positive policy change is that the report cards handed to students at the year end
8tiQuiCdbkM,273700,275240,"that is, the progress report,"
8tiQuiCdbkM,275260,281560,"Until now, the teachers assess how the student has performed in the entire year, according to them"
8tiQuiCdbkM,281820,286620,"Now, assessment will be done by not only the teachers, but the students will also self evaluate themselves"
8tiQuiCdbkM,286620,291900,"and say how have they performed in the entire year, according to their perspective"
8tiQuiCdbkM,291900,296259,"Not only will there be self evaluation, the rest of the students of the class with also evaluate and say"
8tiQuiCdbkM,296260,300060,how a particular student has performed according to the perspective of the rest of the classmates
8tiQuiCdbkM,300060,302300,This is a very useful step
8tiQuiCdbkM,302300,307940,Because critical thinking is a very important aspect- to evaluate oneself by oneself
8tiQuiCdbkM,307940,312260,to think about what one is doing and critically analyze one's own decisions
8tiQuiCdbkM,312260,315020,And in the coming life...
8tiQuiCdbkM,315020,319599,"We are told how we are performing by our teachers and parents, when we are in school"
8tiQuiCdbkM,319700,326220,"But when the school and college life gets over, there is no one to tell you how your performance is going"
8tiQuiCdbkM,326420,330160,You have to do a self evaluation of how you are performing in life
8tiQuiCdbkM,330440,332440,and what you want to do ahead in life
8tiQuiCdbkM,332440,336900,"So, this thinking should be imparted at an early stage to the students"
8tiQuiCdbkM,337060,342139,to evaluate oneself and to see what others think about you
8tiQuiCdbkM,342140,344320,"and what your evaluation is, from their perspective"
8tiQuiCdbkM,344660,345760,It is very useful
8tiQuiCdbkM,346320,347380,Another important change-
8tiQuiCdbkM,347380,352860,I have kept on saying in my videos that the government should spend more on education
8tiQuiCdbkM,353080,355240,Seems as if the government has finally paid heed!
8tiQuiCdbkM,355460,360600,The government has decided that atleast 6% of the GDP will ow be spent on education
8tiQuiCdbkM,360600,363660,"Right now, it is around 3%- which is insufficient"
8tiQuiCdbkM,363660,367720,"And compared to the developed countries and the rest of the developing countries,"
8tiQuiCdbkM,367840,372060,India spends very less on education in measure of the percentage of the GDP
8tiQuiCdbkM,372080,374080,6% is a great target
8tiQuiCdbkM,374080,378300,But a lot depends on implementation as well- How soon is the government able to achieve it
8tiQuiCdbkM,378300,383319,"But obviously, as a first step, setting a target of 6% is commendable"
8tiQuiCdbkM,383320,386840,There was a problem of rote learning in the Indian education system
8tiQuiCdbkM,386840,391520,. Most of the exams are designed in a way that we need to memorize things
8tiQuiCdbkM,391520,397300,"And all that we learnt, evaporates in a few months because we gave exams by rote learning"
8tiQuiCdbkM,397480,400760,"So, the government has also said that it would try and change this as well"
8tiQuiCdbkM,400760,406120,The exams would be designed a way that would not require much memorization or rote learning
8tiQuiCdbkM,406220,410140,"But how exactly this will be achieved is not clearly mentioned. So, it remains to be seen"
8tiQuiCdbkM,410300,413720,I'm hopeful that positive changes will be implemented here as well
8tiQuiCdbkM,417360,421759,Talking about education after class 12- there is a multiple entry and exit programme
8tiQuiCdbkM,421760,427500,"It means that- say, you started a degree- a B.tech degree"
8tiQuiCdbkM,427500,430900,"and one year later, you realize that you do not want to continue with it because you don't like it"
8tiQuiCdbkM,430960,435900,"So, you can drop midway. All the subjects that you have studied for one year,"
8tiQuiCdbkM,435900,440000,you can take their credits and get it transferred to another degree
8tiQuiCdbkM,440000,444260,This is extremely useful and already exists in most of the developed countries
8tiQuiCdbkM,444260,446980,It's great that this option will be available in India as well
8tiQuiCdbkM,447120,451180,This option now includes another feature- say the degree is of four years
8tiQuiCdbkM,451180,453979,"If you drop out after one year, then you will get a certificate"
8tiQuiCdbkM,453980,456680,"If you drop out after the second year, then you will get a diploma"
8tiQuiCdbkM,456680,461400,"After three years, you will get a bachelor's degree and after four years - a bachelor's research degree"
8tiQuiCdbkM,462140,467340,"If you have already done a four year degree in bachelors, MA and MSc degrees would only be of one year"
8tiQuiCdbkM,467340,469600,and two years if you have a bachelor's degree of three years
8tiQuiCdbkM,469600,472840,This is again consistent with the international standard
8tiQuiCdbkM,472840,478720,Top 100 foreign institutes have been given permission to set up their campuses within India
8tiQuiCdbkM,478800,482699,What's interesting is that this is a policy that Congress wanted to bring in when it was in power
8tiQuiCdbkM,482700,485680,"but back then, BJP had opposed it. And now, it itself is bringing it in"
8tiQuiCdbkM,485880,490440,"Focussing on vocational education, the government has said that in the next ten years,"
8tiQuiCdbkM,490600,496160,it will be integrated in all the schools and higher educational institutions in a phased manner
8tiQuiCdbkM,496320,502200,"It is being aimed that by 2025, 50% of the learners in schools and higher educational institutions"
8tiQuiCdbkM,502200,504940,will have had exposure to vocational education
8tiQuiCdbkM,504940,510740,A common national professional standard will be set for all the teachers by 2022
8tiQuiCdbkM,510740,517820,A four years integrated BA degree would be the minimum qualification required to become a teacher by 2030
8tiQuiCdbkM,518039,522599,"These, in my opinion were the positive points brought by the government in this new policy"
8tiQuiCdbkM,522640,525940,Let us now talk about the negative/controversial points
8tiQuiCdbkM,525940,527780,which are being criticized by the people
8tiQuiCdbkM,531280,535940,This new policy has been criticized the most on the point of language
8tiQuiCdbkM,535940,540160,"This policy reads that, ""wherever possible the medium of instruction till 5th grade"
8tiQuiCdbkM,540160,546040,"and preferably till class 8 and beyond will be the home language, local language or the  regional language"""
8tiQuiCdbkM,546140,551880,"That is, the education of the child until the 5th grade should be in home language, mother language and regional language"
8tiQuiCdbkM,552040,554800,It is nowhere written that doing so is compulsory
8tiQuiCdbkM,554800,560140,But those who criticize it say that this will force the schools to not teach in English
8tiQuiCdbkM,560140,561660,and instead teach in regional languages
8tiQuiCdbkM,561660,563519,which will not be beneficial for most of the people
8tiQuiCdbkM,563660,568720,"Say, you live in Kerala and your child has studied until class 4 in Kerala"
8tiQuiCdbkM,568940,571520,"Thereupon, you shift to Maharashtra"
8tiQuiCdbkM,571520,574540,Most of the schools would teach in Marathi in Maharashtra
8tiQuiCdbkM,574540,576160,and the child will not be able to adjust
8tiQuiCdbkM,576160,580639,This would restrict the movement of the people from one state to another
8tiQuiCdbkM,580640,582480,and this might have a detrimental effect
8tiQuiCdbkM,582480,587160,"It is written in the policy that no language would be forced. Although, it is also said that"
8tiQuiCdbkM,587360,594459,they would try to make Sanskrit and other classical languages available at every level in schools as an option
8tiQuiCdbkM,594460,600160,"and after class 9, the options of foreign languages will also be available like they are right now"
8tiQuiCdbkM,600160,604139,"In my opinion, it is important to give priority to English because today,"
8tiQuiCdbkM,604140,607820,"English, in a way , has become a global language of communication worldwide"
8tiQuiCdbkM,607820,611700,"No matter which country you come from, I believe it is essential to learn English"
8tiQuiCdbkM,611700,617180,if you want to do any thing at an international level
8tiQuiCdbkM,617400,620460,It is becoming essential to learn English in every country
8tiQuiCdbkM,620760,626800,And this is an advantage for India in comparison to China and the rest of the South East Asian countries
8tiQuiCdbkM,626800,629480,"because there, people are not able to learn English to this extent"
8tiQuiCdbkM,629480,635120,"Since people in India speak English, they are able to compete in western countries, US and Europe"
8tiQuiCdbkM,635280,640760,Second- Several student and teachers' bodies have criticized this policy of being anti democratic
8tiQuiCdbkM,640960,645160,"Some parties have also criticized it. For example, CPI(M) has put forward the most criticism"
8tiQuiCdbkM,645160,648920,They allege that the states were not consulted before making this policy
8tiQuiCdbkM,649120,655900,Since education is a concurrent subject that comes under both the Centre as well as state list
8tiQuiCdbkM,655900,660340,the states should have been consulted more before introducing this policy
8tiQuiCdbkM,660680,665860,It is also alleged that this policy promotes centralization because this policy has a point that
8tiQuiCdbkM,665860,669640,states that a new teachers' training board will be set up for all kinds of teachers in the country
8tiQuiCdbkM,669640,671260,and no state can change that
8tiQuiCdbkM,671260,675140,The power has been taken from the states and placed with the central government
8tiQuiCdbkM,675140,677600,The powers have been made more centralized that
8tiQuiCdbkM,677600,681560,the decision making regarding education would be done by the center
8tiQuiCdbkM,681640,685840,"And finally, some points of criticism said that this policy is very theoretical"
8tiQuiCdbkM,686020,690540,It does change things theoretically. But to implement them practically in real life
8tiQuiCdbkM,690540,693440,is going to be a very long drawn and difficult process
8tiQuiCdbkM,693440,699560,because there are so many government schools where children in the 5th class have no teachers
8tiQuiCdbkM,699560,701840,and sound infrastructure is not available in schools
8tiQuiCdbkM,701840,705120,The students are not educated properly and they drop out early
8tiQuiCdbkM,705460,708720,There are so many government schools with a serious dearth of available  teachers
8tiQuiCdbkM,708720,714040,so how are they going to impart vocational training and give the option of variety of subjects to children
8tiQuiCdbkM,714040,715180,All this seems impossible to give
8tiQuiCdbkM,715180,717180,This is another point of criticism
8tiQuiCdbkM,717420,723060,because all these changes being brought superficially are extremely difficult to implement in reality
8tiQuiCdbkM,723300,725839,"In my opinion, it is a legit point of criticism"
8tiQuiCdbkM,725840,730240,and it is to be seen how much of these policies are implemented
8tiQuiCdbkM,730240,733320,and what changes are seen on the ground level in reality
