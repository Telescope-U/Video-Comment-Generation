s8hWQwFwayo,18320,26880,i have never seen anybody who did  extraordinary feats  that didn't have extraordinary issues
s8hWQwFwayo,26880,34000,it is the passion  that gives you the power you need  but it is the pain
s8hWQwFwayo,34000,39280,from which you have the conviction about  it  if you had not been through some pains

s8hWQwFwayo,108640,115280,not the smartest nor the most  intelligent animal in the jungle and yet  when the lion shows up he is king
s8hWQwFwayo,115280,121439,he is king you don't need to be  intelligent you don't need to be smart  you don't need to have a certain height  you don't need to have a certain way you

s8hWQwFwayo,245760,253040,i don't know what to say really  three minutes
s8hWQwFwayo,253040,260479,to the biggest battle of our  professional lives  all comes down to today
s8hWQwFwayo,262800,269520,we're in hell right now gentlemen  believe  me and
s8hWQwFwayo,269520,274880,we can stay here get the [ __ ] kicked out  of us  or
s8hWQwFwayo,274880,282560,we can fight our way back  into the light  we can climb out of hell or you could be
s8hWQwFwayo,282560,287600,like me dream of pro football get hurt  dream over
s8hWQwFwayo,287600,294400,find yourself with just seven bucks in  your pocket  so how did i get here  by being the hardest worker in the room
s8hWQwFwayo,294400,302000,now it's time to see who has a heart  now is the time to prove to yourselves
s8hWQwFwayo,302000,309280,and prove to everyone out there or  somebody  you're worthy of something
s8hWQwFwayo,309280,314639,and you're able to do something special  that no one else in the world can do
s8hWQwFwayo,314639,322520,are you ready to go out there and take  what's yours  what you worked hard for
s8hWQwFwayo,325440,332080,all of us in life have things we want  we don't get what we want we get what we
s8hWQwFwayo,332080,334960,have to have
s8hWQwFwayo,337280,343120,we all get what we tolerate  in ourselves and other people
s8hWQwFwayo,343120,349030,but when you're no longer willing to  tolerate something that's when your life  changes
s8hWQwFwayo,349030,355919,[Music]  everyone in the world  has a list of things they think they
s8hWQwFwayo,355919,363360,should do  i should lose weight  i should work out  i should spend more time with my kids
s8hWQwFwayo,363360,369120,i should work harder i should make more  calls i should i should i should i
s8hWQwFwayo,369120,375199,should  and then you know what people don't do  their shoulds and they get mad at  themselves they beat themselves up about
s8hWQwFwayo,375199,380960,it  what changes people is when your should
s8hWQwFwayo,380960,388080,becomes a must  when suddenly the thing you said should  happen has to happen
s8hWQwFwayo,388080,393199,that's when human beings change  it's like if you want to take the island
s8hWQwFwayo,393199,398720,and you're the head of the army you want  to take the island the most powerful way  to take the island is burn the boats
s8hWQwFwayo,398720,405360,because if there's no way to go back  it's amazing what happens when it's a  must to do something versus a should
s8hWQwFwayo,405360,413540,that's what makes human beings succeed  [Music]
s8hWQwFwayo,413759,419840,ego is the success inhibitor you have to  do your best not to make decisions based
s8hWQwFwayo,419840,426880,off of ego for sure  success and failure are generally slow
s8hWQwFwayo,426880,433759,processes  either slowly building things up
s8hWQwFwayo,433759,438720,or  gradually tearing them down
s8hWQwFwayo,440800,447599,and  that's why i say you've got to pay  attention  [Music]
s8hWQwFwayo,447599,452880,you have to  watch you have to watch every single
s8hWQwFwayo,452880,460960,second  because those seconds
s8hWQwFwayo,461039,468960,they turn into minutes  [Music]  and minutes  turn into hours and hours turn into days
s8hWQwFwayo,468960,476160,and days turn in to years  [Music]
s8hWQwFwayo,476879,483919,and so  that second  that second that just went by
s8hWQwFwayo,483919,489280,that counted  and so did that second
s8hWQwFwayo,489280,495840,and so did that one and in those  precious seconds you are either
s8hWQwFwayo,495840,502400,building  or you are decaying you are either
s8hWQwFwayo,502400,508879,gaining ground  [Applause]  or you were losing ground
s8hWQwFwayo,508879,515680,in that second  and in every second
s8hWQwFwayo,518240,524640,every second counts  [Music]
s8hWQwFwayo,524640,531920,so  make  every  second
s8hWQwFwayo,532320,538800,the dream shattered sent home with seven  bucks in my pocket i was like wait no i  gotta play in the nfl eventually those
s8hWQwFwayo,538800,543839,are my big goals that's my dream you  realize that that playing in the nfl was
s8hWQwFwayo,543839,549279,the best thing that never happened  because it got me here so my point is  look you're going to get your ass kicked

s8hWQwFwayo,554480,560080,happen  oftentimes is the best thing that never  happened so have faith and just keep
s8hWQwFwayo,560080,565220,that in mind and keep plugging away  [Music]
s8hWQwFwayo,567360,573760,when you crawl out from underneath the  covers every morning and you sit on the  edge of the bed
s8hWQwFwayo,573760,580800,you have a choice before you we're wired  differently we have to set a goal that  if we hit that goal we're guaranteed to

s8hWQwFwayo,748800,755440,somebody's chasing you somebody's coming  from behind and somebody's trying to  take your spot and so every single day
s8hWQwFwayo,755440,762800,when you wake up you gotta set new goals  new benchmarks you got to raise it  higher and higher and higher so you can
s8hWQwFwayo,762800,769120,make your dreams become a reality hunter  watching watson a true hunter is wired  differently
s8hWQwFwayo,769120,776639,he's wired differently  had the same makeup listen to me what  makes a gazelle a gazelle is how he's
s8hWQwFwayo,776639,782560,wired  what makes a lioness okay let me explain  to you when a lion sees a gazelle and
s8hWQwFwayo,782560,789120,the gazelle sees the lion both bees see  each other at the exact same time when  the gazelle sees the lion because of how
s8hWQwFwayo,789120,794000,he's wired he automatically fear takes  over
s8hWQwFwayo,794399,801440,when the lion sees a gazelle  [Music]  he lights up it's showtime
s8hWQwFwayo,801440,809440,the hunt is on this is what i was made  for do the work  [Music]  do the [ __ ] work
s8hWQwFwayo,809440,815320,why do you want to work out  what is your goal
s8hWQwFwayo,816800,821839,the most important thing is that you  have a vision  that you have a goal
s8hWQwFwayo,821839,829839,because without that vision without that  goal again you're drifting around and  you're never going to end up anywhere
s8hWQwFwayo,831279,836480,people don't become successful  just by accident you know i mean maybe
s8hWQwFwayo,836480,841760,the guy  that found gold in california and  started the gold rush but don't count on
s8hWQwFwayo,841760,847279,that that's a one in a lifetime kind of  a situation so you got to really have a
s8hWQwFwayo,847279,853279,specific order to me to have that vision  that i want to be mr universe
s8hWQwFwayo,853279,859600,they don't want to be the greatest  bodybuilder of all time  that was a great vision and that
s8hWQwFwayo,859600,865760,specifically to look like reg park and  to be up there on that stage and to lift  the trophy overhead and to win the
s8hWQwFwayo,865760,871519,championship over and over and over  again so that was a great goal you have  to have a goal now it doesn't have to be
s8hWQwFwayo,871519,878639,that specific goal but it has to have  some goal this is why i always recommend  it to people sit down take your time and
s8hWQwFwayo,878639,884880,start thinking about  why do you want to work out what is your  goal and that can be as crazy as it is
s8hWQwFwayo,884880,890560,it could be you know i want to impress  girls if that's your goal so be it but
s8hWQwFwayo,890560,897279,it motivates you it could be that you're  emulating a certain you know bodybuilder  or a certain football player a certain
s8hWQwFwayo,897279,904560,boxer whatever it is have those pictures  put all over the wall like i did when i  was a kid i put pictures of rich pocket
s8hWQwFwayo,904560,911279,of sunny listen of boxers and of ali and  the power lifters and weightlifters all  over my bedroom
s8hWQwFwayo,911279,917360,you know a wall  so that every day when i go to sleep  every day when i wake up i look at those
s8hWQwFwayo,917360,922959,pictures and they motivate me you need  that motivation and then therefore you  have this kind of
s8hWQwFwayo,922959,928800,imprint in front of you all the time and  you know exactly what you're chasing
s8hWQwFwayo,931040,937839,people always come up to me says why are  you smiling you're working out five  hours a day you're doing the same as the  other guys but the other guys have a
s8hWQwFwayo,937839,943440,sour face they're pissed off that they  have to do another rep or another set or  something i looked forward to i looked
s8hWQwFwayo,943440,950800,forward to another thousand  reps of sit-ups i looked forward to  another 500 pounds of of a leg press or
s8hWQwFwayo,950800,957759,squat i looked forward doing more and  more curls until my arms fall off why  because i knew that every rep that i did
s8hWQwFwayo,957759,965519,in every set that i did and more weights  did i lift it i get one step closer to  turning that vision into reality so i
s8hWQwFwayo,965519,971360,was turned on by that i was excited i  couldn't wait to get to the gym
s8hWQwFwayo,979040,985519,i remembered that when i weighed 245  pounds  and bob raferson the director of stay
s8hWQwFwayo,985519,991839,hungry said to me that i'm interested in  having you come in for reading and work  on your acting and all this because i'm
s8hWQwFwayo,991839,997600,interested in having you in the movie to  start with the jeff bridges and with  sally fields i was delighted about that
s8hWQwFwayo,997600,1004240,i was excited and i started pumping up  more and more and then he said but  i don't want you to weigh more than 210
s8hWQwFwayo,1004240,1009360,pounds  you want me to be in the movie but i'm
s8hWQwFwayo,1009360,1016480,weighing 245 to 46. i see i just won the  olympia i say in 19 which was 1974
s8hWQwFwayo,1016480,1021519,and i was really at my biggest  and but he demanded that and he says
s8hWQwFwayo,1021519,1027120,look it's very  simple on the day  we start shooting
s8hWQwFwayo,1027120,1032798,he says i'm gonna put you on the scale  and if you don't make the 210 you're out
s8hWQwFwayo,1032798,1040000,because i have someone else in mind  and  i worked on it i started visualizing
s8hWQwFwayo,1040000,1045360,myself very clearly as a lean athlete  because that's the only way i could lose
s8hWQwFwayo,1045360,1050640,that weight in the office and get  interested in running more because up  until that point i ran like three miles
s8hWQwFwayo,1050640,1058000,after training or before training or  whatever but now all of a sudden it was  five miles six miles seven miles eight  miles and they even ran mini marathons
s8hWQwFwayo,1058000,1065679,in order to lose the weight and they did  everything with high reps and i was  watching my diet what they eat and all  those kind of things and by the day
s8hWQwFwayo,1065679,1072160,the day before  i remember we went birmingham alabama  the day before i was at the ymca with
s8hWQwFwayo,1072160,1079039,bob rafeson he was swimming and i was  working out and i was running there was  a tractor that was running he says
s8hWQwFwayo,1079039,1084240,let's step on the scale and i stepped on  the scale and they were 209
s8hWQwFwayo,1084240,1091260,so it just shows you what is possible if  you visualize exactly what you want to  look like
s8hWQwFwayo,1091260,1103930,[Music]
s8hWQwFwayo,1108799,1114240,and there was no room for any kind of  like well i can get my act together or  anything like this because there's only
s8hWQwFwayo,1114240,1120480,a certain amount of time but the key  thing again is have the clear vision
s8hWQwFwayo,1120480,1127440,have the specific goal of what you want  to accomplish because then you never go  to the gym and you say the day
s8hWQwFwayo,1127440,1135039,i feel down a little bit  i don't know what it is all about i  don't know my life i'm confused no
s8hWQwFwayo,1135039,1142399,i tell you that i was a perfect example  of someone that was not confident at all
s8hWQwFwayo,1145919,1152000,i mean when i was a kid that was just  like any other kid that had hang-ups and  problems and all this
s8hWQwFwayo,1152000,1157039,but when i joined the weightlifting club  and i won my first
s8hWQwFwayo,1157039,1162320,little trophy  because they did the best clean jerk
s8hWQwFwayo,1162320,1169919,and then we went to another meet and  they won another little trophy  i started feeling like somebody
s8hWQwFwayo,1171360,1177520,but the bottom line is  everyone can use the same method because  i used it in politics i used it in
s8hWQwFwayo,1177520,1183280,making money i used it and everything  that i've done in the movie business  when you have one little victory little
s8hWQwFwayo,1183280,1189280,victories add up and that is what gives  you then ultimately confidence
s8hWQwFwayo,1189280,1197760,well for me the most important thing  always to have a deadline  so when i for instance had a competition
s8hWQwFwayo,1197760,1203520,and let's say the competition was in the  middle of september  and it was now beginning of summer
s8hWQwFwayo,1203520,1209200,so there was no more time to screw  around so there was the time now to get  going on a diet to get going with the
s8hWQwFwayo,1209200,1216320,training to not slack off at all because  there was a deadline there the day of  the competition i had to be in the best
s8hWQwFwayo,1216320,1222480,shape possible and i knew that if i come  to the competition and then lose because
s8hWQwFwayo,1222480,1228720,i did not schedule my training the  proper way or i didn't have the right  frame of mind or i didn't give
s8hWQwFwayo,1228720,1234880,everything  literally worked my butt off i would be  just so angry so i never wanted to be in
s8hWQwFwayo,1234880,1240159,that situation so this is why it was  very important to pick that time and to  say this is when i have to be in top
s8hWQwFwayo,1240159,1245280,shape and then i work towards that but  it's not just with the competition i  mean they're always the same in the
s8hWQwFwayo,1245280,1252559,movie business i mean to me it was  always a big advantage when i said okay  my movie starts on april 1 and i have
s8hWQwFwayo,1252559,1258000,now three months so i have to get really  in great shape  so you pick those times it could also be
s8hWQwFwayo,1258000,1263520,that they have no movie and you have no  mr olympia or no mr america no mr  universe coming up or any of those
s8hWQwFwayo,1263520,1269760,things but you say to yourself  the summer starts in june  i'm gonna go to the beach in june and at
s8hWQwFwayo,1269760,1275760,that time i want to be in great shape so  that creates an urgency that makes you  really start training out and taking it
s8hWQwFwayo,1275760,1281440,seriously because if you don't have a  specific plan then you wander around i  mean you can have as i have told you
s8hWQwFwayo,1281440,1287280,many times the best ship or the best  plane in the world but if you don't have  a specific goal where you want to go and
s8hWQwFwayo,1287280,1293039,when you want to get there you just  drift around and you never get anywhere  so this is why it is important to create
s8hWQwFwayo,1293039,1301280,that urgency and have a specific time  when you want to be in shape well i mean  look everyone has a problem with time
s8hWQwFwayo,1301280,1307039,but  the day is 24 hours  and we sleep six
s8hWQwFwayo,1307039,1313919,now i know there are some out there that  say well whoa whoa i need eight  well i say just sleep a little faster
s8hWQwFwayo,1313919,1319120,because the bottom line is we have six  hours of sleep 24 hours are available so
s8hWQwFwayo,1319120,1324640,if 18 hours now available to your work  your family
s8hWQwFwayo,1324640,1331039,your hobbies  and also to learn something new or to do  something new which could easily be that
s8hWQwFwayo,1331039,1336960,you want to learn a new language  or that you want to read and as a  new year's resolution you have to read a
s8hWQwFwayo,1336960,1343120,book every week or you say i'm going to  go and reshape my body  so you're going to go and take this hour
s8hWQwFwayo,1343120,1349840,out of your schedule and say i'm going  to train an hour every day so this is  for most people a huge challenge but it
s8hWQwFwayo,1349840,1355520,is totally doable i can tell them  because the kind of things that i did  when i came to this country i mean i
s8hWQwFwayo,1355520,1361360,went to school i was working in  construction  i was working out my five hours a day i
s8hWQwFwayo,1361360,1367840,was taking acting classes from eight  o'clock at night to 12 midnight i was  doing all of those things
s8hWQwFwayo,1367840,1375280,i wanted to make sure  that out of the 24 hours of the day that  i don't waste one single hour those
s8hWQwFwayo,1375280,1380880,hours were too precious and so then i  just want to tell people don't give me  this thing i have a difficult time with
s8hWQwFwayo,1380880,1387730,the time and i don't have time for this  and i don't have that you have time you  make the time
s8hWQwFwayo,1387730,1394260,[Music]
s8hWQwFwayo,1394320,1400320,it's another early morning  every morning every day of our lives we
s8hWQwFwayo,1400320,1405600,have choices to make you have a choice  to stay in bed  to say
s8hWQwFwayo,1405600,1412720,forget it i'm not gonna work out today  or  forget it i'm not gonna  work hard today you always have a choice
s8hWQwFwayo,1412720,1417919,every single day of your life  done today
s8hWQwFwayo,1417919,1423520,no one cares what you did  yesterday  you gotta change your dialogue
s8hWQwFwayo,1423520,1430480,there used to be a mentality  doesn't work  what have you done today to better
s8hWQwFwayo,1430480,1437200,yourself  today is another day today is another
s8hWQwFwayo,1437200,1445039,day that i'm faced  with another choice to make  so i'm making the choice again to put my
s8hWQwFwayo,1445039,1453039,shoes on early in the morning  and get acting again  make the right decision
s8hWQwFwayo,1454400,1460159,well some of you read  that i think about when it's hot outside  that it's
s8hWQwFwayo,1460159,1465919,sunny in 70.  well it's [ __ ] not today  it's the reality it's about 90 degrees
s8hWQwFwayo,1465919,1472559,100 humidity but who gives a [ __ ]  that being said  september 3rd
s8hWQwFwayo,1472559,1479600,i had to have my book turned in  and when i realized i'm reading this  book a lot  but i realized
s8hWQwFwayo,1479600,1486240,i wasn't born this [ __ ]  i made them  at the bottom of insecurities fear
s8hWQwFwayo,1486240,1491919,self-doubt lies  was me buried in the [ __ ] fetal  position
s8hWQwFwayo,1491919,1499120,how i got out of that  was recognizing being honest with it  being truthful with it and then fixing
s8hWQwFwayo,1499120,1505440,it we like to live on social media with  lies about ourselves how great we are
s8hWQwFwayo,1505440,1510200,get to the source and fix the problem
s8hWQwFwayo,1512380,1518720,[Music]  i'm a big believer in doing something  that sucks
s8hWQwFwayo,1518720,1524559,every single day of your life  i believe it's a key component
s8hWQwFwayo,1524559,1532080,into strengthening your mind  every day you're trying to find more  of what you're capable of
s8hWQwFwayo,1532080,1537200,and that's the big question  what are you capable of
s8hWQwFwayo,1537200,1542880,stop doing the things  that you do every day  you run every day
s8hWQwFwayo,1542880,1545520,go swim
s8hWQwFwayo,1548880,1555200,flip your towel one tire for a mile  you'll definitely build something so
s8hWQwFwayo,1555200,1560799,i'm all about casting the mind  do something that sucks
s8hWQwFwayo,1565600,1571360,don't get twisted  it's not about flipping tires  i'm in las vegas right now and it's hot
s8hWQwFwayo,1571360,1579039,as [ __ ] it's not about any of that  but what it is about  is a lot of us give total control
s8hWQwFwayo,1579039,1585679,to  life  we don't have any control of it we just  give all control to life
s8hWQwFwayo,1585679,1590960,i do this [ __ ] every morning  to prepare my mind for what life's gonna
s8hWQwFwayo,1590960,1599320,throw at me  a healthy body gives you a healthy mind  that's what it's about
s8hWQwFwayo,1604080,1610400,so i just got back from a long run  and  what i realized for myself and a lot of
s8hWQwFwayo,1610400,1617760,people  is that  life is one big tug of war  between mediocrity
s8hWQwFwayo,1617760,1623840,and trying to find your best self  so  there's tricks to all this crap in life
s8hWQwFwayo,1623840,1630159,life is one big head game  one trick in this situation is so i  didn't want to run so what did i do i
s8hWQwFwayo,1630159,1635600,figured out a couple of things  you have to sometimes  let mediocrity think that you're giving
s8hWQwFwayo,1635600,1642080,into it  so i said you know what instead of going  for a 20 miler so go out for an easy
s8hWQwFwayo,1642080,1647600,six or seven  what that did in my brain was it said  okay mediocrity thought it won
s8hWQwFwayo,1647600,1654799,so let loose a little bit  and let go of that oh this is gonna suck  this could be okay it's not too bad
s8hWQwFwayo,1654799,1660799,the second should get to mile two guess  what happens  greatness pulls mediocrity into [ __ ]
s8hWQwFwayo,1660799,1665120,mud  get out there and get after it
s8hWQwFwayo,1666640,1673279,you wanna go in about the right mindset  the right gear  in combat you wear body armor
s8hWQwFwayo,1673279,1678880,but what we do wrong is we want to  strengthen our minds  you got to strengthen your mind
s8hWQwFwayo,1678880,1685279,take control over that  so then when you get out in the real  world and they [ __ ] you up you got
s8hWQwFwayo,1685279,1693200,protection  so i'm about 15 miles from home  and i i often talk about taking souls
s8hWQwFwayo,1693200,1698320,this morning  this person i usually train alone
s8hWQwFwayo,1698320,1703919,this person wanted to run with me  and i said fine we'll run 15.
s8hWQwFwayo,1703919,1711520,this morning comes  there's storms coming in this way  and the person calls and said hey
s8hWQwFwayo,1711520,1717360,why don't we do it tomorrow  taking souls is when i told him  [ __ ]
s8hWQwFwayo,1717360,1722559,i'm gonna run 15 today  and i'll run with you again tomorrow
s8hWQwFwayo,1722559,1728559,that's what taking souls is about  don't worry about the elements and  what's going on
s8hWQwFwayo,1728559,1731919,you gotta get out there and get it
s8hWQwFwayo,1734320,1740640,he wasn't the only one  that felt about taking the day off  because the storm is coming in right now
s8hWQwFwayo,1740640,1748399,and there's not a soul out here but me  [Music]
s8hWQwFwayo,1748399,1754320,if you want to get better  do the [ __ ]  that no one else
s8hWQwFwayo,1754320,1760159,wants to do  do the [ __ ] that no one else is even  thinking about doing
s8hWQwFwayo,1760640,1766080,at the end of the day hard work  may not be enough you still may fail
s8hWQwFwayo,1766080,1769960,just stay at it go ahead
s8hWQwFwayo,1777950,1781729,[Music]
s8hWQwFwayo,1783760,1790320,the more things you can do  get outside that zone  that zone is that zone makes you feel
s8hWQwFwayo,1790320,1795840,good  the stronger your mind's gonna get
s8hWQwFwayo,1795919,1801039,it starts getting used to doing [ __ ]  like this  it's not fun
s8hWQwFwayo,1801039,1807679,my mind's used to it  when that alarm clock goes off there's  at least 50 of the time where you just
s8hWQwFwayo,1807679,1814559,that that soft little pillow is just  caressing your head and you want to stay  there  and it takes discipline to go nope i'm
s8hWQwFwayo,1814559,1821520,gonna get up out of this bed i'm gonna  do what i'm supposed to do we are  average probably about five hours of  sleep work hard sleep
s8hWQwFwayo,1821520,1828000,tomorrow morning when that alarm goes  off and you start feeling all the  excuses that come in and that bed is
s8hWQwFwayo,1828000,1833120,cozy i know what you're saying i love my  bed too  and you then go five four three two one
s8hWQwFwayo,1833120,1840640,and you get up that discipline that you  have at that moment you win that fight  that's a big victory and then that that
s8hWQwFwayo,1840640,1846960,that pattern will carry out throughout  the day because once you're up well now  that i'm up i might as well go work out  because i'm already up and i i feel good
s8hWQwFwayo,1846960,1853279,that i got up out of bed and i won that  battle let me go win another battle i'm  gonna go get it done and that discipline  carries on throughout the day so now you
s8hWQwFwayo,1853279,1859519,take that and you you expand that out  over a week in a month and you end up  with more discipline and it starts with
s8hWQwFwayo,1859519,1866640,that simple act of getting up and  getting out of bed in the morning i work  out twice before everyone wakes up so it
s8hWQwFwayo,1866640,1872640,started off four o'clock in the morning  where i'd start and start with my cardio  then i'd have breakfast and then i would  go to the gym and then i go to work i
s8hWQwFwayo,1872640,1879279,wake up at 4 30 in the morning because  no one else is awake yet so that gives  me the opportunity to do things that i  need to get done
s8hWQwFwayo,1879279,1885039,kind of selfishly for myself and the big  one in that category is working out and  it doesn't feel good at 4 30 when you
s8hWQwFwayo,1885039,1890640,get up but by the time seven o'clock  rolls around and you've already worked  out you've already gotten some some work
s8hWQwFwayo,1890640,1896159,done and you've got some time to say  goodbye to your kids before they go to  school it's infinitely better than
s8hWQwFwayo,1896159,1901919,sleeping in until 6 45 and you get out  of bed and now you missed your kids  going to school or or whatever you
s8hWQwFwayo,1901919,1907679,you're not prepared for the day it's  it's awful wake up at the same time  every day and if you pick that time and
s8hWQwFwayo,1907679,1914240,you start waking up at the same time  every day that's very good for you it  doesn't have to be 4 30 it could be 6  30. it could be 7 i don't know what your
s8hWQwFwayo,1914240,1919600,personal schedule is find out a time  pick it set it stick to it
s8hWQwFwayo,1919600,1926480,look everyone has a problem with time  but  the day is 24 hours
s8hWQwFwayo,1926480,1932960,and we sleep six  now i know there are some out there that  say whoa whoa whoa i need eight
s8hWQwFwayo,1932960,1938320,but i say just sleep a little faster  because the bottom line is we have six
s8hWQwFwayo,1938320,1944880,hours of sleep 24 hours are available so  if 18 hours now available do your work
s8hWQwFwayo,1944880,1952240,your family  your hobbies and also to learn something  new or to do something new which could
s8hWQwFwayo,1952240,1958399,easily be that you want to learn a new  language to read a book every week or  you say i'm going to go and reshape my
s8hWQwFwayo,1958399,1964960,body  so you're going to go and take this hour  out of your schedule and say i'm going  to train an hour every day
s8hWQwFwayo,1964960,1970880,so this is for most people a huge  challenge but it is totally doable i can  tell them because the kind of things
s8hWQwFwayo,1970880,1977200,that i did when i came to this country i  mean i went to school i was working in  construction
s8hWQwFwayo,1977200,1984159,i was working out my five hours a day i  was taking acting classes from 8 o'clock  at night to 12 midnight i was doing all
s8hWQwFwayo,1984159,1990559,of those things  i wanted to make sure  that out of the 24 hours of the day that
s8hWQwFwayo,1990559,1997360,i don't waste one single hour those  hours were too precious and so then i  just want to tell people don't give me
s8hWQwFwayo,1997360,2002960,this thing i have a difficult time with  the time and i don't have time for this  and i have that you have time you make
s8hWQwFwayo,2002960,2008720,the time sometimes even if you're the  most highly motivated person in the  world that grind starts to beat you down
s8hWQwFwayo,2008720,2014960,a little bit and that's when you have to  stop looking at the short-term thing  because that's not that's not getting  you to get it done and you got to look
s8hWQwFwayo,2014960,2021679,okay what is the long-term goal that i'm  looking at what am i really trying to  get done in the long term and you say oh  you know what i'm actually waking up
s8hWQwFwayo,2021679,2027120,today early so i can be ahead of the  curve so i can sell more of these  widgets or whatever
s8hWQwFwayo,2027120,2032799,so that i can buy a house  and you know what today matters today  matters this decision that i'm making
s8hWQwFwayo,2032799,2038960,right now is that first step it's me  taking one stroke swimming in the right  direction heading towards the shore and
s8hWQwFwayo,2038960,2044080,if i don't take this i'm not making any  progress i've been struggling struggling  struggling we still had all the same
s8hWQwFwayo,2044080,2049760,problems  i stole a lien on the house still facing  bankruptcy still fighting like crazy i
s8hWQwFwayo,2049760,2055200,was still unemployed the next morning  the alarm goes off and um
s8hWQwFwayo,2055200,2061280,i pretended nasa was there  it's the stupidest story i literally  went five four three two one i counted
s8hWQwFwayo,2061280,2068240,out loud and then i stood up  and i i'll never forget standing there  and for the first time in three months
s8hWQwFwayo,2068240,2074800,i had beaten my habit  of hitting the snooze button  i couldn't believe it and i thought wait
s8hWQwFwayo,2074800,2080079,a minute  counting backwards is the dumbest thing  i've ever heard in my entire life well
s8hWQwFwayo,2080079,2085118,the next morning i used it again and it  worked the next morning i used it again  and it worked the next morning i used it
s8hWQwFwayo,2085118,2092560,again and it worked and then i started  to notice something really interesting  there were moments all day long
s8hWQwFwayo,2092560,2098720,all day long  just like that five second moment in bed
s8hWQwFwayo,2098720,2107040,where i knew knowledge what i should do  [Music]  and if i didn't move within five seconds
s8hWQwFwayo,2107040,2113839,my brain would step in and talk me out  of it  every human being has a five second  window might even be shorter
s8hWQwFwayo,2113839,2119359,for you  you have about a five second window in  which you can move from
s8hWQwFwayo,2119359,2125680,idea to action before your brain kicks  into full gear  and sabotages
s8hWQwFwayo,2125680,2130720,any change in behavior  because remember your brain is wired to  stop you from doing things that are
s8hWQwFwayo,2130720,2136880,uncomfortable or uncertain or scary  it's your job to learn how to move from
s8hWQwFwayo,2136880,2142800,those ideas that could change everything  into acting on them in the smallest
s8hWQwFwayo,2142800,2148960,moment when i was in high school i uh  early on about 16 years old i decided to
s8hWQwFwayo,2148960,2154000,become president united states because i  thought how can i contribute the most to  society and i went to a seminar by a man
s8hWQwFwayo,2154000,2159760,named jim rohn he's still a seminar  speaker  i took a week's pay i was working 40 a  week as a janitor
s8hWQwFwayo,2159760,2166240,and um it was 35 for the evening seminar  so it was big decision i listened to him  speak and i came out so inspired because
s8hWQwFwayo,2166240,2172079,most of what he said i already believed  now as an authority figure saying you  really can be this way
s8hWQwFwayo,2172079,2179359,why pay the price  why work this hard  why go this far
s8hWQwFwayo,2179359,2185680,why try to learn this much  why try to do it all
s8hWQwFwayo,2185680,2192079,why try to see it all  why try to have it all
s8hWQwFwayo,2192079,2197520,why do it  why learn it why study why put yourself  out
s8hWQwFwayo,2197520,2201838,why try to take on this much  responsibility

s8hWQwFwayo,2603440,2609839,life out of it  it's not your fault if your partner
s8hWQwFwayo,2609839,2615200,cheated and ruined your marriage but it  is for damn sure your responsibility to

s8hWQwFwayo,3172880,3179520,years you picture yourself as a pro  wrestler but when you answer other  portions of the questionnaire you're not
s8hWQwFwayo,3179520,3185280,even in a film yet  this is what's wrong with people today
s8hWQwFwayo,3185280,3195040,this is what's wrong with people today  they think that great lives just fall  out of god if they dream hard enough
s8hWQwFwayo,3195040,3202240,fantasies hard enough and long enough  they keep stroking that that their life  will turn out just the way they dream
s8hWQwFwayo,3202240,3208640,it's a fly you're feeding yourself every  day  alive
s8hWQwFwayo,3208640,3215200,why  would they continue  to fight
s8hWQwFwayo,3215200,3221040,why would they continue to go on  even though
s8hWQwFwayo,3221040,3228640,they are being  beaten  all across the ring the octagon
s8hWQwFwayo,3228640,3233920,or the wrestling map  why would they do that what would make  them

s8hWQwFwayo,3252240,3257440,and the answer  is simple
s8hWQwFwayo,3258800,3265280,they cannot  help themselves
s8hWQwFwayo,3265280,3273000,because they are  a fighter  and being a fighter it is
s8hWQwFwayo,3273000,3279240,inbred in them  to fight
s8hWQwFwayo,3279520,3288319,no matter  how  difficult or lost the situation may seem
s8hWQwFwayo,3288319,3294480,they cannot  help themselves  it's impossible
s8hWQwFwayo,3294480,3304319,for them to stop fighting  [Music]

s8hWQwFwayo,3505680,3512000,you know this idea of time like how much  time did you put in today like you could  work out in a [ __ ] manner for two
s8hWQwFwayo,3512000,3517040,hours and not get nearly as much done as  you can for a half hour hard just
s8hWQwFwayo,3517040,3523119,running so i have to get those things in  the only exceptions are injuries and  sickness
s8hWQwFwayo,3526000,3531440,i do everything that i can to put my  body and my brain in a good place so
s8hWQwFwayo,3531440,3538240,that i'm i'm keeping my engine smooth  i'm changing my oil i'm changing my  spark plugs i'm making sure that it's
s8hWQwFwayo,3538240,3544400,operating i mean it's not going to be  perfect but yeah i know that i've done  my best to keep it working the best that
s8hWQwFwayo,3544400,3551040,it can there's consequences that you pay  to constantly seeking comfort and and  avoiding discomfort and avoiding hard
s8hWQwFwayo,3551040,3556559,work and those consequences are you're  never going to feel self-realized you're  never going to feel like you  accomplished anything you're never going
s8hWQwFwayo,3556559,3562480,to have this feeling of understanding  that  difficulty and struggle and and the
s8hWQwFwayo,3562480,3568160,ability to push through that is a muscle  and you develop that muscle by doing it  and once you do you develop a lot of
s8hWQwFwayo,3568160,3574160,self-satisfaction and you develop peace  of mind and you you understand that you  can overcome obstacles if you don't have
s8hWQwFwayo,3574160,3579280,to overcome obstacles you never know  whether or not you can unless you're  faced with actual adversity you don't
s8hWQwFwayo,3579280,3586160,understand how you're gonna feel and how  you're gonna react when you overcome  that adversity  things that are difficult when you do
s8hWQwFwayo,3586160,3592240,these difficult things you're stressing  your mind or i should start stressing  your mind
s8hWQwFwayo,3592240,3597680,exercising your mind and exercising your  body's ability to manage intense
s8hWQwFwayo,3597680,3603520,situations it's hard it's very difficult  it's very testing and in doing so  you
s8hWQwFwayo,3603520,3610480,you lessen the stress of regular life  the more  stressful situations that i experience
s8hWQwFwayo,3610480,3615839,the more i understand what they are and  the more i can relax
s8hWQwFwayo,3618559,3625200,but it's also like  the a matter of constantly being  exposed to these stressful situations
s8hWQwFwayo,3625200,3631920,where there's not a long break in  between doing stand-up or a long break  in between martial arts training where
s8hWQwFwayo,3631920,3638640,to the point where anxiety can build up  and then once you get into it it's  almost an it's an unusual situation
s8hWQwFwayo,3638640,3644400,instead of an unusual one what i tell  people is the best advice that i i've  ever
s8hWQwFwayo,3644400,3649599,heard  the best advice i ever came up with is  that live your life like you're the hero
s8hWQwFwayo,3649599,3656079,in your movie and right now is when the  [ __ ] movie starts and your life is a  [ __ ] back disaster pretend you are of
s8hWQwFwayo,3656079,3662240,right now you are in the part of the  movie that starts and it shows you as a  [ __ ] loser and just decide not to be
s8hWQwFwayo,3662240,3668839,a loser anymore live your life like  there's a documentary crew following you  around and you are analyzing your
s8hWQwFwayo,3668839,3675440,own do what you would want to do so that  your kids one day would look back at it  and see that documentary and look on it
s8hWQwFwayo,3675440,3681839,with pride like wow my dad was a bad  [ __ ] he really did what he had  to do wow my mom really got her [ __ ]
s8hWQwFwayo,3681839,3688640,together i'd love a success story but  even more than a success story i like a  dude who [ __ ] his life up and then gets
s8hWQwFwayo,3688640,3695040,it back together against dory those are  my favorite stories and the way to do  that you gotta write [ __ ] down you gotta
s8hWQwFwayo,3695040,3701200,think that you are the hero in your own  [ __ ] movie and then you get a sit  down and you gotta write [ __ ] down write
s8hWQwFwayo,3701200,3707920,down what you need to do  truth

s8hWQwFwayo,4252480,4258880,i've been on this quest to figure out  how can a person be on fire and say man  this is what i've been put on this earth  to do but the moment a couple of things
