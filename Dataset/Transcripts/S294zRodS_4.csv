S294zRodS_4,0,3820,The average American spends 13 and a half years of their life in school.
S294zRodS_4,3820,6580,And that's not counting the amount of time that you spend watching Crash Course.
S294zRodS_4,6580,10470,Getting a bachelor’s degree means spending upwards of 17 years as a student.
S294zRodS_4,10470,15820,And advanced degrees like medical degrees or PhDs can tack on another 4 to 6 years on top of that.
S294zRodS_4,15820,18580,"So, why do we spend so much time in the classroom?"
S294zRodS_4,18589,22819,"With so much information available to us with just a few taps on our phones and computers,"
S294zRodS_4,22820,27340,it might seem like sitting in a classroom to learn about the world isn’t really necessary anymore.
S294zRodS_4,27340,34560,But educational institutions aren’t just places where we learn facts – and Google is no substitute for the social functions that schools provide.
S294zRodS_4,34560,36300,"In fact, neither is Crash Course."
S294zRodS_4,36300,45420,So let’s take a look at how educational institutions are organized in our society and what those institutional structures can tell us about how our society functions.
S294zRodS_4,45420,56079,[Theme Music]
S294zRodS_4,56080,59180,"You know what I mean when I talk about “Education,” right?"
S294zRodS_4,59180,66220,"For our purposes, education is the social institution through which society provides its members with all kinds of important knowledge,"
S294zRodS_4,66220,71060,not just basic facts and job skills but also cultural norms and values.
S294zRodS_4,71060,77799,"And this can come in the form of formal schooling, where instruction comes from specially trained teachers, but it doesn’t have to."
S294zRodS_4,77800,84400,What education has looked like across different eras and different places is very different from the schooling that you probably know.
S294zRodS_4,84400,86960,"Historically, education was a privilege of the wealthy."
S294zRodS_4,86960,90000,"In fact, the word school comes from the Greek word for leisure – ‘Scole’."
S294zRodS_4,90000,96120,"In Ancient Greece, wealthy young men spent their free time learning from scholars like Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato."
S294zRodS_4,96120,101100,"Nowadays, most high-income countries have formal schooling systems that are available to everyone."
S294zRodS_4,101100,107920,So the amount of schooling that the average person gets in most societies is closely tied to the country’s level of economic development.
S294zRodS_4,107920,111920,"While young people in the US can expect to spend at least 12 years in school,"
S294zRodS_4,111920,116060,those who live in lower-income countries are much more likely to never get past middle school.
S294zRodS_4,116060,122780,"The US, however, will be the setting that we’ll be using to explore how sociology understands education as a social institution."
S294zRodS_4,122780,128080,So let’s go right to the Thought Bubble for a quick overview of how schooling is structured in the United States.
S294zRodS_4,128080,132300,"In the US, publicly funded schools have existed since almost the beginning of our country."
S294zRodS_4,132300,139260,"Thomas Jefferson was an early proponent of separating schools from religious institutions, which at the time were the main providers of education."
S294zRodS_4,139260,144040,"The widespread availability of public schools really took off in the middle of the 19th century,"
S294zRodS_4,144040,152540,"when politician and educational reformer Horace Mann pushed for Massachusetts to create a formalized, state funded system of primary schools."
S294zRodS_4,152540,159860,"By 1918, all states had passed mandatory education laws, which required children to attend school until they reached the age of 16."
S294zRodS_4,159860,162620,A major aim of these laws was to promote literacy.
S294zRodS_4,162620,170280,Both Jefferson and Mann pushed for public education systems because they believed that a well-educated populace was a necessary requirement for a democracy.
S294zRodS_4,170280,176959,"Nowadays, about 87% of students in the US attend public schools, which start in kindergarten when children are five."
S294zRodS_4,176960,181960,"And when I say public schools, this refers to schools funded through the government with taxpayer dollars."
S294zRodS_4,181960,186700,"And of course, US public schools are organized into primary and secondary education."
S294zRodS_4,186700,194560,"Compulsory education starts with elementary school, which begins for most Americans around age 5 and continues through 5th grade, until ages 10 or 11."
S294zRodS_4,194560,196860,These grades are considered “primary” schooling.
S294zRodS_4,196860,203200,"Starting at age 11 or 12, children enter middle- or junior high school, which consists of grades 6th through 8th in most states."
S294zRodS_4,203200,208000,"Around age 14, they typically enter high school, which often includes 9th through 12th grades."
S294zRodS_4,208000,211000,Middle and High school are also referred to as “secondary schooling.”
S294zRodS_4,211000,214500,"And many school districts offer alternatives to the standard high school curriculum,"
S294zRodS_4,214500,218820,"in the form of Vocational and Technical training schools, sometimes known as VoTech schools."
S294zRodS_4,218820,223980,"Votech schools focus on teaching specific skills, like automotive repair or cosmetology,"
S294zRodS_4,223980,228140,and students leave school with certifications that help them enter the workforce right away.
S294zRodS_4,228140,229280,Thanks Thought Bubble!
S294zRodS_4,229280,233740,Another educational option is private school – those schools not funded by taxpayer dollars.
S294zRodS_4,233740,236480,Why might a family choose a private school over a public school?
S294zRodS_4,236480,241659,"Well, for one thing, private schools are often able to tailor their curricula to specific populations."
S294zRodS_4,241660,248820,"Because public schools are open to everybody, they try to serve the widest swath of the student populace – what’s sometimes referred to as ‘teaching the middle.’"
S294zRodS_4,248820,255200,So the 10% of American students who attend private schools might be there in search of a more rigorous education.
S294zRodS_4,255200,262620,"Parents of kids with disabilities may also choose a private school that's specially tailored to their child’s needs, which may not be available in a public school."
S294zRodS_4,262620,266699,And it's worth pointing out that most private schools in the US are religiously affiliated.
S294zRodS_4,266700,272580,These schools provide religious instruction alongside academic training – a practice that's not allowed in public schools.
S294zRodS_4,272580,276060,"You know, because of the whole separation of church and state thing in the Constitution."
S294zRodS_4,276060,280100,Another option for parents who don't want to send their kids to public school is homeschooling.
S294zRodS_4,280100,283220,"That's just where a kid is educated at home, typically by a parent."
S294zRodS_4,283220,285780,About 3% of students in the US are homeschooled.
S294zRodS_4,285780,291400,"All of these different approaches to education cover the K-12 years, when children are required to attend school."
S294zRodS_4,291400,297300,"But some people may choose to keep going to school and enter post-secondary institutions, better known as college or university."
S294zRodS_4,297300,303979,"Unlike primary and secondary schooling, post-secondary schooling – in the US at least – is largely funded by the students themselves."
S294zRodS_4,303980,309440,"Public state colleges and universities are joint ventures between taxpayers and students, who pay some tuition to attend."
S294zRodS_4,309440,312340,"Two-year colleges, sometimes known as junior or community colleges,"
S294zRodS_4,312340,318360,"typically give associates degrees, technical certifications, and sometimes high-school equivalency degrees, or GEDs."
S294zRodS_4,318360,325300,The highest level of education attained by 28% of Americans over the age of 25 is attending some college or have a two-year degree.
S294zRodS_4,325300,331379,"Four-year institutions in the US can either be public universities, funded jointly by state taxes and student tuition,"
S294zRodS_4,331380,335780,or private universities funded almost exclusively through tuition and private donations.
S294zRodS_4,335780,342860,"The reason I keep talking about funding is that, in the US, paying for college is one of the highest barriers to getting a post-secondary education."
S294zRodS_4,342860,346520,"As a result, going to college is by no means a given for Americans."
S294zRodS_4,346520,352960,Only 32.5% of Americans over the age of 25 have graduated with a bachelor’s degree from a four-year university.
S294zRodS_4,352960,360319,"Of these graduates, about one third will go on to get more education, like medical school or a masters or a doctorate in a discipline like sociology."
S294zRodS_4,360320,364080,12% of American over the age of 25 have some sort of advanced degree.
S294zRodS_4,364080,369220,Education must matter an awful lot for people to willingly choose to spend so much time and money on it.
S294zRodS_4,369220,375220,"And, of course, our schools of sociological thought can help us understand how educational systems help shape society,"
S294zRodS_4,375220,378340,and why education carries such importance in people’s lives.
S294zRodS_4,378340,382060,"Today, we’ll be looking at Structural Functionalism and Symbolic Interactionism and next week,"
S294zRodS_4,382060,385160,we’ll look more in-depth at education using a conflict theory perspective.
S294zRodS_4,385160,391200,"As you might expect by this point, structural functionalism looks at how formal education helps keep a society running smoothly."
S294zRodS_4,391200,393460,Because structural functionalism looks at everything that way.
S294zRodS_4,393460,398180,"And we can think of how education works in society, in terms of both manifest and latent functions."
S294zRodS_4,398180,401759,Manifest functions are the intended consequences of education.
S294zRodS_4,401760,406800,And an obvious example of a manifest function is just...teaching kids the basic facts about the world.
S294zRodS_4,406800,409819,It’s pretty hard to get through the world without knowing how to read or write.
S294zRodS_4,409820,416820,"And even for people who don’t use math every single day, it’s pretty useful to be able to calculate a 20% tip without needing to pull out a calculator."
S294zRodS_4,416820,419760,Another manifest function of schooling is socialization.
S294zRodS_4,419760,425440,"By going to school outside the home, kids begin to learn norms and values beyond what their parents might teach them."
S294zRodS_4,425440,431500,"For example, schools engage in cultural transmission, or passing along knowledge to a new generation of citizens."
S294zRodS_4,431500,438320,"Children in public schools start their day by pledging allegiance to the American flag – and by doing so, learn patriotic values."
S294zRodS_4,438320,445780,"Similarly, civics and history courses teach them how political processes work, which helps create a well-informed, well-functioning civil society."
S294zRodS_4,445780,453660,"In this way, schools also act to promote social integration, taking people from different backgrounds and exposing them to social norms and cultural values,"
S294zRodS_4,453660,457060,in an effort to promote a shared understanding of the social world.
S294zRodS_4,457060,464300,And educational institutions do more than just pass on knowledge – they also help us create new knowledge through cultural innovation and research.
S294zRodS_4,464300,470900,"Every major advance in our society – whether it's the technology of self-driving cars, or new understandings of the inequalities we see in the world –"
S294zRodS_4,470900,474479,has been possible because it built on the knowledge we learn in schools.
S294zRodS_4,474480,481580,"Yet another manifest function of schools is to educate the future workforce, teaching the skills that people need to be productive members of society."
S294zRodS_4,481580,487960,"So formal education acts as a form of credentialing, a way of establishing someone’s qualifications to work in a certain field."
S294zRodS_4,487960,491280,You know that diploma you got when you graduated – or will get when you do graduate?
S294zRodS_4,491280,493700,That's documented proof of your credentials.
S294zRodS_4,493700,497540,And educational credentials are often used as a way of determining social status –
S294zRodS_4,497540,503000,"they determine social placement by telling us who can access which jobs, and how much they should be paid for that work –"
S294zRodS_4,503000,505300,factors that determine socioeconomic status.
S294zRodS_4,505300,511860,"Now, in addition to all of these intended functions of education, there are some unintended consequences, or latent functions, of schooling, too."
S294zRodS_4,511860,515719,One of the more important ones is learning how to be a good 9 to 5 worker.
S294zRodS_4,515719,521379,"Horace Mann’s original vision of public schools was based on a Prussian model of schooling now known as the ‘factory school model,’"
S294zRodS_4,521380,526240,because it teaches children how to work within a set schedule and listen to authority figures.
S294zRodS_4,526240,530899,Those are skills that come in handy as an adult when your boss tells you to be at your desk at 9 in the morning.
S294zRodS_4,530900,538260,"K-12 Schools also provide childcare that makes working parents’ lives easier – not the intended purpose of schools certainly, but a pretty useful latent function."
S294zRodS_4,538260,541620,And a third latent function of schools is that they just help you make friends!
S294zRodS_4,541620,546339,Schools help people form social groups by introducing them to many people around their same age.
S294zRodS_4,546340,550340,This also makes it easy to meet and interact with potential romantic partners around your age –
S294zRodS_4,550340,553980,which might be why we see so many college and high school sweethearts who tie the knot.
S294zRodS_4,553980,559639,Structural functionalism stresses all the ways that schooling helps maintains the order and stability of society.
S294zRodS_4,559640,566960,But our other theories of sociological thought point out the ways that educational institutions may maintain practices that are not beneficial to everyone.
S294zRodS_4,566960,572820,Recall that symbolic-interactionist approaches explore how people create the world that we live in through their day-to-day interactions.
S294zRodS_4,572820,579820,"In the context of education, we see this play out in how stereotypes created by society can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy."
S294zRodS_4,579820,584480,Teachers who believe a student has high ability tend to give that student more attention and feedback –
S294zRodS_4,584480,591380,"which in turn helps that student believe that they have high ability, which in turn helps that student develop greater academic ability."
S294zRodS_4,591380,600020,"Similarly, if you decide you’re just not a “math person,” you might try to avoid doing math at all and stop taking math classes as soon as your school lets you –"
S294zRodS_4,600020,603780,which will pretty much guarantee that you end up not being all that good at math.
S294zRodS_4,603780,611480,"Self-fulfilling prophecies can have very real consequences when its beliefs about student’s abilities are influenced by stereotypes of race, gender, or class."
S294zRodS_4,611480,614639,The lower graduation rate of racial minorities is one outcome.
S294zRodS_4,614640,618700,"So too is women’s underrepresentation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math fields."
S294zRodS_4,618700,625860,"Next week, we’ll use the lens of social conflict theory to explore more about how schooling can both cause and perpetuate social inequalities."
S294zRodS_4,625860,633140,"This week, we discussed the history of education as a social institution, with a specific focus on how the US organizes its educational system."
S294zRodS_4,633140,639820,We also talked about structural functionalist approaches to education and some of the manifest and latent functions associated with education.
S294zRodS_4,639820,644760,"Finally, we discussed a symbolic interactionist approach to education that shows us how self-fulfilling"
S294zRodS_4,644760,649980,prophecies in educational settings contribute to differences in academic outcomes for students.
S294zRodS_4,649980,656699,"Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT, and it’s made with the help of all of these nice people."

S294zRodS_4,241660,248820,"Because public schools are open to everybody, they try to serve the widest swath of the student populace – what’s sometimes referred to as ‘teaching the middle.’"
S294zRodS_4,248820,255200,So the 10% of American students who attend private schools might be there in search of a more rigorous education.
S294zRodS_4,255200,262620,"Parents of kids with disabilities may also choose a private school that's specially tailored to their child’s needs, which may not be available in a public school."
S294zRodS_4,262620,266699,And it's worth pointing out that most private schools in the US are religiously affiliated.
S294zRodS_4,266700,272580,These schools provide religious instruction alongside academic training – a practice that's not allowed in public schools.
S294zRodS_4,272580,276060,"You know, because of the whole separation of church and state thing in the Constitution."
S294zRodS_4,276060,280100,Another option for parents who don't want to send their kids to public school is homeschooling.
S294zRodS_4,280100,283220,"That's just where a kid is educated at home, typically by a parent."
S294zRodS_4,283220,285780,About 3% of students in the US are homeschooled.
S294zRodS_4,285780,291400,"All of these different approaches to education cover the K-12 years, when children are required to attend school."
S294zRodS_4,291400,297300,"But some people may choose to keep going to school and enter post-secondary institutions, better known as college or university."
S294zRodS_4,297300,303979,"Unlike primary and secondary schooling, post-secondary schooling – in the US at least – is largely funded by the students themselves."
S294zRodS_4,303980,309440,"Public state colleges and universities are joint ventures between taxpayers and students, who pay some tuition to attend."
S294zRodS_4,309440,312340,"Two-year colleges, sometimes known as junior or community colleges,"
S294zRodS_4,312340,318360,"typically give associates degrees, technical certifications, and sometimes high-school equivalency degrees, or GEDs."
S294zRodS_4,318360,325300,The highest level of education attained by 28% of Americans over the age of 25 is attending some college or have a two-year degree.
S294zRodS_4,325300,331379,"Four-year institutions in the US can either be public universities, funded jointly by state taxes and student tuition,"
S294zRodS_4,331380,335780,or private universities funded almost exclusively through tuition and private donations.
S294zRodS_4,335780,342860,"The reason I keep talking about funding is that, in the US, paying for college is one of the highest barriers to getting a post-secondary education."
S294zRodS_4,342860,346520,"As a result, going to college is by no means a given for Americans."
S294zRodS_4,346520,352960,Only 32.5% of Americans over the age of 25 have graduated with a bachelor’s degree from a four-year university.
S294zRodS_4,352960,360319,"Of these graduates, about one third will go on to get more education, like medical school or a masters or a doctorate in a discipline like sociology."
S294zRodS_4,360320,364080,12% of American over the age of 25 have some sort of advanced degree.
S294zRodS_4,364080,369220,Education must matter an awful lot for people to willingly choose to spend so much time and money on it.
S294zRodS_4,369220,375220,"And, of course, our schools of sociological thought can help us understand how educational systems help shape society,"
S294zRodS_4,375220,378340,and why education carries such importance in people’s lives.
S294zRodS_4,378340,382060,"Today, we’ll be looking at Structural Functionalism and Symbolic Interactionism and next week,"
S294zRodS_4,382060,385160,we’ll look more in-depth at education using a conflict theory perspective.
S294zRodS_4,385160,391200,"As you might expect by this point, structural functionalism looks at how formal education helps keep a society running smoothly."
S294zRodS_4,391200,393460,Because structural functionalism looks at everything that way.
S294zRodS_4,393460,398180,"And we can think of how education works in society, in terms of both manifest and latent functions."
S294zRodS_4,398180,401759,Manifest functions are the intended consequences of education.
S294zRodS_4,401760,406800,And an obvious example of a manifest function is just...teaching kids the basic facts about the world.
S294zRodS_4,406800,409819,It’s pretty hard to get through the world without knowing how to read or write.
S294zRodS_4,409820,416820,"And even for people who don’t use math every single day, it’s pretty useful to be able to calculate a 20% tip without needing to pull out a calculator."
S294zRodS_4,416820,419760,Another manifest function of schooling is socialization.
S294zRodS_4,419760,425440,"By going to school outside the home, kids begin to learn norms and values beyond what their parents might teach them."
S294zRodS_4,425440,431500,"For example, schools engage in cultural transmission, or passing along knowledge to a new generation of citizens."
S294zRodS_4,431500,438320,"Children in public schools start their day by pledging allegiance to the American flag – and by doing so, learn patriotic values."
S294zRodS_4,438320,445780,"Similarly, civics and history courses teach them how political processes work, which helps create a well-informed, well-functioning civil society."
S294zRodS_4,445780,453660,"In this way, schools also act to promote social integration, taking people from different backgrounds and exposing them to social norms and cultural values,"
S294zRodS_4,453660,457060,in an effort to promote a shared understanding of the social world.
S294zRodS_4,457060,464300,And educational institutions do more than just pass on knowledge – they also help us create new knowledge through cultural innovation and research.
S294zRodS_4,464300,470900,"Every major advance in our society – whether it's the technology of self-driving cars, or new understandings of the inequalities we see in the world –"
S294zRodS_4,470900,474479,has been possible because it built on the knowledge we learn in schools.
S294zRodS_4,474480,481580,"Yet another manifest function of schools is to educate the future workforce, teaching the skills that people need to be productive members of society."
S294zRodS_4,481580,487960,"So formal education acts as a form of credentialing, a way of establishing someone’s qualifications to work in a certain field."
S294zRodS_4,487960,491280,You know that diploma you got when you graduated – or will get when you do graduate?
S294zRodS_4,491280,493700,That's documented proof of your credentials.
S294zRodS_4,493700,497540,And educational credentials are often used as a way of determining social status –
S294zRodS_4,497540,503000,"they determine social placement by telling us who can access which jobs, and how much they should be paid for that work –"
S294zRodS_4,503000,505300,factors that determine socioeconomic status.
S294zRodS_4,505300,511860,"Now, in addition to all of these intended functions of education, there are some unintended consequences, or latent functions, of schooling, too."
S294zRodS_4,511860,515719,One of the more important ones is learning how to be a good 9 to 5 worker.
S294zRodS_4,515719,521379,"Horace Mann’s original vision of public schools was based on a Prussian model of schooling now known as the ‘factory school model,’"
S294zRodS_4,521380,526240,because it teaches children how to work within a set schedule and listen to authority figures.
S294zRodS_4,526240,530899,Those are skills that come in handy as an adult when your boss tells you to be at your desk at 9 in the morning.
S294zRodS_4,530900,538260,"K-12 Schools also provide childcare that makes working parents’ lives easier – not the intended purpose of schools certainly, but a pretty useful latent function."
S294zRodS_4,538260,541620,And a third latent function of schools is that they just help you make friends!
S294zRodS_4,541620,546339,Schools help people form social groups by introducing them to many people around their same age.
S294zRodS_4,546340,550340,This also makes it easy to meet and interact with potential romantic partners around your age –
S294zRodS_4,550340,553980,which might be why we see so many college and high school sweethearts who tie the knot.
S294zRodS_4,553980,559639,Structural functionalism stresses all the ways that schooling helps maintains the order and stability of society.
S294zRodS_4,559640,566960,But our other theories of sociological thought point out the ways that educational institutions may maintain practices that are not beneficial to everyone.
S294zRodS_4,566960,572820,Recall that symbolic-interactionist approaches explore how people create the world that we live in through their day-to-day interactions.
S294zRodS_4,572820,579820,"In the context of education, we see this play out in how stereotypes created by society can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy."
S294zRodS_4,579820,584480,Teachers who believe a student has high ability tend to give that student more attention and feedback –
S294zRodS_4,584480,591380,"which in turn helps that student believe that they have high ability, which in turn helps that student develop greater academic ability."
S294zRodS_4,591380,600020,"Similarly, if you decide you’re just not a “math person,” you might try to avoid doing math at all and stop taking math classes as soon as your school lets you –"
S294zRodS_4,600020,603780,which will pretty much guarantee that you end up not being all that good at math.
S294zRodS_4,603780,611480,"Self-fulfilling prophecies can have very real consequences when its beliefs about student’s abilities are influenced by stereotypes of race, gender, or class."
S294zRodS_4,611480,614639,The lower graduation rate of racial minorities is one outcome.
S294zRodS_4,614640,618700,"So too is women’s underrepresentation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math fields."
S294zRodS_4,618700,625860,"Next week, we’ll use the lens of social conflict theory to explore more about how schooling can both cause and perpetuate social inequalities."
S294zRodS_4,625860,633140,"This week, we discussed the history of education as a social institution, with a specific focus on how the US organizes its educational system."
S294zRodS_4,633140,639820,We also talked about structural functionalist approaches to education and some of the manifest and latent functions associated with education.
S294zRodS_4,639820,644760,"Finally, we discussed a symbolic interactionist approach to education that shows us how self-fulfilling"
S294zRodS_4,644760,649980,prophecies in educational settings contribute to differences in academic outcomes for students.
