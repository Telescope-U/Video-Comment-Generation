rtL7XbxLJf0,14639,17359,hey guys so we are going to pick up the
rtL7XbxLJf0,17359,18800,keys right now
rtL7XbxLJf0,18800,20480,because we were originally planning on
rtL7XbxLJf0,20480,22240,moving in today
rtL7XbxLJf0,22240,24560,but then the
rtL7XbxLJf0,24560,26160,like you have to book the elevator in
rtL7XbxLJf0,26160,27599,order to move in
rtL7XbxLJf0,27599,30640,because obviously like you don't want to
rtL7XbxLJf0,30640,32320,be taking up the elevator when people
rtL7XbxLJf0,32320,33360,are trying to go on it and i'm pretty
rtL7XbxLJf0,33360,35680,sure there's two elevators and so you
rtL7XbxLJf0,35680,38960,have to book one in order to like move
rtL7XbxLJf0,38960,40640,in and stuff so then they just like
rtL7XbxLJf0,40640,42160,block off the elevator for you so that
rtL7XbxLJf0,42160,44079,you can just have it all to yourself so
rtL7XbxLJf0,44079,46480,it makes it easier to move in
rtL7XbxLJf0,46480,47920,so we got the elevator booked for
rtL7XbxLJf0,47920,49920,tomorrow at 8 am because it was all
rtL7XbxLJf0,49920,52000,booked up today so we couldn't
rtL7XbxLJf0,52000,53680,get it for today so we can't move in
rtL7XbxLJf0,53680,55520,today but we're going to go pick up the
rtL7XbxLJf0,55520,57520,keys because he's like oh i'll give you
rtL7XbxLJf0,57520,58960,guys the keys tonight because our
rtL7XbxLJf0,58960,60399,elevators booked so early in the morning
rtL7XbxLJf0,60399,62000,it's 8 am so we're gonna have to wake up
rtL7XbxLJf0,62000,63120,at like six
rtL7XbxLJf0,63120,64559,so it was just better that it gave us
rtL7XbxLJf0,64559,66000,the keys tonight
rtL7XbxLJf0,66000,66880,so
rtL7XbxLJf0,66880,68320,yeah when we get there i'm going to be
rtL7XbxLJf0,68320,69680,showing you guys i think i'm going to do
rtL7XbxLJf0,69680,72080,an empty apartment tour for you guys
rtL7XbxLJf0,72080,73600,because that's going to be the perfect
rtL7XbxLJf0,73600,75200,time to do it when we literally haven't
rtL7XbxLJf0,75200,77360,moved nothing in yet
rtL7XbxLJf0,77360,79360,we do have some stuff as you can see in
rtL7XbxLJf0,79360,80720,the back here
rtL7XbxLJf0,80720,83600,um this is honestly a lot of my clothing
rtL7XbxLJf0,83600,85520,this is like all the drill stuff plus my
rtL7XbxLJf0,85520,88560,clothes and then his bike
rtL7XbxLJf0,88560,90400,so we're gonna see if they will let us
rtL7XbxLJf0,90400,92159,do a couple of trips just to move up
rtL7XbxLJf0,92159,93439,bags
rtL7XbxLJf0,93439,94560,and
rtL7XbxLJf0,94560,95920,you know do that without having the
rtL7XbxLJf0,95920,97680,elevator booked
rtL7XbxLJf0,97680,99600,so hopefully they'll allow us to do that
rtL7XbxLJf0,99600,101520,because it would be really nice to empty
rtL7XbxLJf0,101520,104159,in the van today so yeah we'll see but
rtL7XbxLJf0,104159,106880,anyways move in
rtL7XbxLJf0,106880,108320,day one is tomorrow i guess you could
rtL7XbxLJf0,108320,109680,say but today you're getting the empty
rtL7XbxLJf0,109680,114119,apartment tour so we're getting the keys
rtL7XbxLJf0,114159,117280,so we are currently going into ikea
rtL7XbxLJf0,117280,119119,because we're just gonna grab a couple
rtL7XbxLJf0,119119,120479,of things
rtL7XbxLJf0,120479,122159,for the place because now we have the
rtL7XbxLJf0,122159,123680,key so we're planning on getting like
rtL7XbxLJf0,123680,126000,some bar stools and then our tv console
rtL7XbxLJf0,126000,128319,right now and then going into the
rtL7XbxLJf0,128319,130479,apartment and like putting it there just
rtL7XbxLJf0,130479,133440,so we don't have to do it all tomorrow
rtL7XbxLJf0,133440,134800,because no one's at the elevator right
rtL7XbxLJf0,134800,135599,now
rtL7XbxLJf0,135599,136959,okay so we think that this is the
rtL7XbxLJf0,136959,138879,console tv console we're gonna get it's
rtL7XbxLJf0,138879,141120,really just sleek and nice and it has a
rtL7XbxLJf0,141120,143920,lot of storage and it's like all the
rtL7XbxLJf0,143920,145760,storage is hidden so it like it's going
rtL7XbxLJf0,145760,148080,to create no mess and it's very sleek
rtL7XbxLJf0,148080,150080,and we also like that it's like high
rtL7XbxLJf0,150080,151280,because like a lot of the other ones are
rtL7XbxLJf0,151280,152400,kind of low
rtL7XbxLJf0,152400,154800,so we like how it's high so the tv so we
rtL7XbxLJf0,154800,157120,don't have to mount the tv
rtL7XbxLJf0,157120,158640,look on the online

rtL7XbxLJf0,661920,663600,is more like in the city if that makes
rtL7XbxLJf0,663600,664560,sense
rtL7XbxLJf0,664560,665839,um i'm obviously not going to tell you
rtL7XbxLJf0,665839,667440,guys my exact location because there's
rtL7XbxLJf0,667440,669120,creepy people out there
rtL7XbxLJf0,669120,670640,um obviously i trust you guys but i
rtL7XbxLJf0,670640,671680,don't trust
rtL7XbxLJf0,671680,673040,you know you know what i mean i'm a 30
rtL7XbxLJf0,673040,674480,minute drive away about

rtL7XbxLJf0,676320,678000,bring from my room but i'm going to do
rtL7XbxLJf0,678000,680000,that more slowly because that's like

rtL7XbxLJf0,693680,694800,we don't really want to do any cooking
rtL7XbxLJf0,694800,696000,right now because nothing is set up and
rtL7XbxLJf0,696000,697680,put away so i feel like that would just
rtL7XbxLJf0,697680,698800,be a giant mess especially with
rtL7XbxLJf0,698800,700640,everything everywhere in the kitchen
rtL7XbxLJf0,700640,702399,that would just like i
rtL7XbxLJf0,702399,703839,i really don't want to do that right now

rtL7XbxLJf0,766160,768240,this is gonna be my closet okay so what
rtL7XbxLJf0,768240,771200,i think i'm gonna do now is we have wine

rtL7XbxLJf0,772639,775200,plates cutlery we actually got black
rtL7XbxLJf0,775200,777440,cutlery and then give you guys like a
rtL7XbxLJf0,777440,778720,ikea haul everything is kind of
rtL7XbxLJf0,778720,780480,scattered but i'm gonna just show you as
rtL7XbxLJf0,780480,783839,i go so we got black cutlery how sick is
rtL7XbxLJf0,783839,785920,this like it's literally so sick i love
rtL7XbxLJf0,785920,787120,the black
rtL7XbxLJf0,787120,790320,um we got glasses and then black plates
rtL7XbxLJf0,790320,792399,they're kind of like grayish but they
rtL7XbxLJf0,792399,794480,match this really well and then wine
rtL7XbxLJf0,794480,795760,glasses we also got champagne glasses
rtL7XbxLJf0,795760,797279,not sure where they are and then we got
rtL7XbxLJf0,797279,798880,this knife set it only has three nice
rtL7XbxLJf0,798880,800880,but this is all we need and it's black
rtL7XbxLJf0,800880,802639,like how sick is this i kind of wanted
rtL7XbxLJf0,802639,804800,to go with a all black theme as you can
rtL7XbxLJf0,804800,806240,see like our toaster is black our kettle
rtL7XbxLJf0,806240,808160,is black this is black like i just feel
rtL7XbxLJf0,808160,810000,like it really just matches the vibe you
rtL7XbxLJf0,810000,810800,know
rtL7XbxLJf0,810800,812240,so
rtL7XbxLJf0,812240,814000,i really like the black theme going on
rtL7XbxLJf0,814000,816800,so what i think i'm going to do is
rtL7XbxLJf0,816800,818800,load the dishwasher with the dishes so
rtL7XbxLJf0,818800,821199,that they can clean so i don't have to
rtL7XbxLJf0,821199,823279,do it all by hand because you obviously
rtL7XbxLJf0,823279,825839,want to clean it before you use them
rtL7XbxLJf0,825839,827760,so we're going to do that i'll give you
rtL7XbxLJf0,827760,829360,guys a better angle
rtL7XbxLJf0,829360,831360,okay so here are the plates literally
rtL7XbxLJf0,831360,833760,how sick is this i'm obsessed i was
rtL7XbxLJf0,833760,835199,going to go with white then i'm like you
rtL7XbxLJf0,835199,836959,know what so i'm going with a black
rtL7XbxLJf0,836959,839040,theme why not get black plates too like
rtL7XbxLJf0,839040,841040,i just think that this is so sick
rtL7XbxLJf0,841040,848000,[Music]
rtL7XbxLJf0,848800,850480,so these are just like the smaller
rtL7XbxLJf0,850480,851839,plates that came with it and then those
rtL7XbxLJf0,851839,855399,are the bigger ones
rtL7XbxLJf0,859519,860880,and then here are the bowls that it came
rtL7XbxLJf0,860880,862120,with
rtL7XbxLJf0,862120,872859,[Music]
rtL7XbxLJf0,874800,877520,so
rtL7XbxLJf0,877520,888240,[Music]
rtL7XbxLJf0,888240,890480,you guys i literally can't
rtL7XbxLJf0,890480,892959,like look at how sick this looks a
rtL7XbxLJf0,892959,895279,dishwasher full of black dishes like
rtL7XbxLJf0,895279,898320,it's just so sleek i just love it and i
rtL7XbxLJf0,898320,900320,do love white as well i do but black
rtL7XbxLJf0,900320,902480,just hits different for some reason
rtL7XbxLJf0,902480,904639,and i'm literally in love so i'm just
rtL7XbxLJf0,904639,907040,gonna do the dishes first to get a nice
rtL7XbxLJf0,907040,908160,good clean
rtL7XbxLJf0,908160,911040,and then i'll do like the glasses next
rtL7XbxLJf0,911040,912880,but honestly
rtL7XbxLJf0,912880,914639,this dish set was such a good price and
rtL7XbxLJf0,914639,916800,the quality is actually pretty good i
rtL7XbxLJf0,916800,918480,think it was like 60
rtL7XbxLJf0,918480,921600,for this whole dish set and then the
rtL7XbxLJf0,921600,923680,cutlery was more expensive honestly for
rtL7XbxLJf0,923680,925279,this whole cutlery set i think it was
rtL7XbxLJf0,925279,927120,like 50 bucks but they're really good
rtL7XbxLJf0,927120,929920,quality like these i like top notch um
rtL7XbxLJf0,929920,931519,so i think we might end up
rtL7XbxLJf0,931519,933600,getting another set just because there's
rtL7XbxLJf0,933600,935839,not much as you can see i think it came
rtL7XbxLJf0,935839,939040,with uh four of each so four teaspoons
rtL7XbxLJf0,939040,941360,four small forks four bigger spoons four
rtL7XbxLJf0,941360,943680,bigger forks and then four knives so
rtL7XbxLJf0,943680,944720,we'll see but i think i'm gonna end up
rtL7XbxLJf0,944720,945839,getting another color he said just
rtL7XbxLJf0,945839,947360,because when you have a guest and like
rtL7XbxLJf0,947360,949279,when you use it you know it's nice to
rtL7XbxLJf0,949279,950399,have like
rtL7XbxLJf0,950399,952160,more so i'm gonna put the load on right
rtL7XbxLJf0,952160,953839,now i'm literally so happy i went with
rtL7XbxLJf0,953839,956240,the black dishes like it looks so sick
rtL7XbxLJf0,956240,957519,so i don't know if i told you guys this
rtL7XbxLJf0,957519,959279,but we are actually the first to live in
rtL7XbxLJf0,959279,961440,this unit because the building is brand
rtL7XbxLJf0,961440,964160,new like the landlord just got the keys
rtL7XbxLJf0,964160,966639,uh when we viewed the place so this is a
rtL7XbxLJf0,966639,968000,little brand new building like we're the
rtL7XbxLJf0,968000,969839,first ones to live in this unit which is
rtL7XbxLJf0,969839,972480,which just makes it like
rtL7XbxLJf0,972480,975440,that much nicer because it's literally
rtL7XbxLJf0,975440,978560,brand spanking new and it's just like
rtL7XbxLJf0,978560,980320,such a good feeling so literally the
rtL7XbxLJf0,980320,981680,first use of everything in this
rtL7XbxLJf0,981680,983279,apartment
rtL7XbxLJf0,983279,985759,yay okay let's put the load on and then

rtL7XbxLJf0,992639,995279,ubereats it wasn't giving me the 50 off
rtL7XbxLJf0,995279,996800,discount thing that they have going on
rtL7XbxLJf0,996800,998880,today so we don't know what to do but
rtL7XbxLJf0,998880,1000240,i'm so hungry i was just snacking on
rtL7XbxLJf0,1000240,1002079,some grapes but yeah okay let's put the
rtL7XbxLJf0,1002079,1003839,dishwasher on no but i'm literally
rtL7XbxLJf0,1003839,1006000,looking up right now how much soap to
rtL7XbxLJf0,1006000,1008240,use in a dishwasher i'm pretty sure you
rtL7XbxLJf0,1008240,1009519,could just pour it in and it doesn't
rtL7XbxLJf0,1009519,1010399,matter
rtL7XbxLJf0,1010399,1012240,but i want to make sure
rtL7XbxLJf0,1012240,1013600,like this is the type of little things
rtL7XbxLJf0,1013600,1015519,that you know we're learning
rtL7XbxLJf0,1015519,1016480,um
rtL7XbxLJf0,1016480,1017680,and
rtL7XbxLJf0,1017680,1019279,you never knew you needed to know so
rtL7XbxLJf0,1019279,1021759,this is how we grow this is how we learn
rtL7XbxLJf0,1021759,1023360,two to three tablespoons there's like a
rtL7XbxLJf0,1023360,1024880,little slot here so i'm just gonna fill
rtL7XbxLJf0,1024880,1027839,that to wherever i think it's right we
rtL7XbxLJf0,1027839,1029839,got the finish this show
rtL7XbxLJf0,1029839,1031199,why can't i speak
rtL7XbxLJf0,1031199,1034959,finish dish soap and open her up
rtL7XbxLJf0,1034959,1038199,so this is the right um hole right

rtL7XbxLJf0,1102320,1103440,actually really looking forward to like
rtL7XbxLJf0,1103440,1105039,organizing it like having your own place
rtL7XbxLJf0,1105039,1106720,is like so

rtL7XbxLJf0,1108320,1110480,is your your call you know what i mean
rtL7XbxLJf0,1110480,1113039,like everything that you do is like it's

rtL7XbxLJf0,1130400,1132559,that's literally the best thing okay so

rtL7XbxLJf0,1141919,1143919,okay i'm gonna this is like one of your
rtL7XbxLJf0,1143919,1145039,things
rtL7XbxLJf0,1145039,1146720,is that he literally has barely any
rtL7XbxLJf0,1146720,1148160,toiletries
rtL7XbxLJf0,1148160,1149600,like this is all that he has and he
