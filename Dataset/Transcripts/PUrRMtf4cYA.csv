PUrRMtf4cYA,514719,521599,now that's thinking outside the box  sweet huh want to give it a try
PUrRMtf4cYA,521599,526640,how hard can a heart be  just a couple of curved lines i haven't
PUrRMtf4cYA,526640,531920,drawn one of these in a while  let's try this again  [Music]
PUrRMtf4cYA,531920,539120,one curve here  i'm terrible at this  [Music]
PUrRMtf4cYA,539120,544320,i can't make the sides even this is  gonna take me forever
PUrRMtf4cYA,544320,550080,but maybe this grip could help i can use  each square going down a peg again and
PUrRMtf4cYA,550080,556000,again  that covers the bottom half
PUrRMtf4cYA,556399,562959,now on to the top  it's prettier with the different colors

PUrRMtf4cYA,586640,592880,until it gets in the way of important  events  i totally forgot to get my mom a

PUrRMtf4cYA,619120,625200,out here  want to make a memorable birthday card
PUrRMtf4cYA,625200,630760,tape down your paper and use a razor to  shave a crayon
PUrRMtf4cYA,631910,637920,[Music]  the more colors the better then use your  finger to swirl things around
PUrRMtf4cYA,637920,644800,blend the colors little by little  time for the second half
PUrRMtf4cYA,645440,650560,and for a more fun effect use a slightly  different pattern
PUrRMtf4cYA,652560,659480,time to get blending again  be sure to blend the sections together
PUrRMtf4cYA,668000,673519,whoa  [Music]  now define your lines a bit
PUrRMtf4cYA,673519,684160,nice  use a stencil to draw in a planet  [Music]
PUrRMtf4cYA,684160,690130,not only does white make cool shapes but  it can make stars as well  don't forget to blend them in
PUrRMtf4cYA,690130,696160,[Music]  it's an intergalactic masterpiece

PUrRMtf4cYA,708560,715120,not even a friend with a sandwich  i can't eat like
PUrRMtf4cYA,715680,724619,all this time to get back to work  [Music]
PUrRMtf4cYA,727440,733680,this plate isn't even dirty  pop out a hole and turn your plate into
PUrRMtf4cYA,733680,741279,a pallet  use old plastic bottle caps like these  to hold paint as you create
PUrRMtf4cYA,741440,745839,i bet van gogh could have used one of  these
PUrRMtf4cYA,748639,755600,tired of this mess lana tada  [Music]  [Applause]
PUrRMtf4cYA,755600,761760,i'll show you how it works  just add paint colors into the little  cats
PUrRMtf4cYA,766480,773839,now you won't make such a mess  and there's plenty of room for a friend  to join you
PUrRMtf4cYA,774320,781760,wow check out bella's concentration when  you're painting still life you've got to  really focus and pay attention to every
PUrRMtf4cYA,781760,788399,single detail  oh yeah this is definitely going to be  refrigerator door worthy maybe even
PUrRMtf4cYA,788399,794720,picture frame status well this is  probably as good as it's going to get  without me full-on tracing the thing on
PUrRMtf4cYA,794720,802240,second thought maybe this drawing will  serve as a practice  round yep we're just gonna toss this
PUrRMtf4cYA,802240,808880,over here for now  oh no bella your paint  oh boy i should have known that was
PUrRMtf4cYA,808880,815040,gonna happen  come on drive faster  hey i wonder if i can use this straw
PUrRMtf4cYA,815040,820800,maybe if i blow into it it'll dry  oh check out those awesome lines this
PUrRMtf4cYA,820800,825920,looks so cool  um  is it just me or did i just create the
PUrRMtf4cYA,825920,832240,perfect tree painting and maybe i should  add some flowers with these q-tips
PUrRMtf4cYA,832240,839120,if you use a q-tip to dab color onto  your tree branches you'll end up with  natural looking flowers but be warned it
PUrRMtf4cYA,839120,844959,may take a few minutes so be sure to be  patient as you go  wow who would have thought such simple
PUrRMtf4cYA,844959,851600,moves could create such a stunning  masterpiece  that's so beautiful bella
PUrRMtf4cYA,851600,856959,well i don't think i'll be needing this  anymore am i brilliant or what another

PUrRMtf4cYA,886399,892480,hey i need those oh a toothbrush can  work too okay with these materials i'm
PUrRMtf4cYA,892480,897680,finally ready to dive into this  for this art hack you'll need a nice big
PUrRMtf4cYA,897680,903040,piece of white paper and a bunch of  q-tips tied together with a rubber band  like this
PUrRMtf4cYA,903040,909920,go ahead and dip the bundle into a giant  glob of paint it's okay if it's unevenly  distributed once that's done blot it
PUrRMtf4cYA,909920,917600,onto the page in random spots  for accent colors just use one q-tip and
PUrRMtf4cYA,917600,923680,dip it into the color of your choice and  among a sea of green dots a couple  streaks of reddish brown can turn it
PUrRMtf4cYA,923680,929199,into a full-blown tree  try using toothbrush bristles to help  create realistic texture in your
PUrRMtf4cYA,929199,935600,paintings as well  using small strokes you can emulate  actual blades of grass see
PUrRMtf4cYA,935600,941040,want to check out my latest work of art  wow you're really like a modern day  monet

PUrRMtf4cYA,1004639,1010320,wait  i just came up with a brilliant idea  just wait until you see what i'm going
PUrRMtf4cYA,1010320,1016560,to do with these  first i'll need a pencil sharpener and  i'll sharpen both ends of the pencil
PUrRMtf4cYA,1016560,1022639,perfect just like that now i'll need a  barrette this pink one will do nicely
PUrRMtf4cYA,1022639,1028240,time to bring out my trusty glue gun for  this next step  i'll need some glue on the pencil a
PUrRMtf4cYA,1028240,1035360,little dab will work just fine  time to glue the pencil onto the  barrette a beautiful rainbow
PUrRMtf4cYA,1035360,1040640,though any color combination would work  look madison now you can be part of the
PUrRMtf4cYA,1040640,1046079,art world too  ah i love it it's so colorful

PUrRMtf4cYA,1097039,1103520,use a fork to twist the fabric kinda  like spaghetti  then randomly place rubber bands around
PUrRMtf4cYA,1103520,1108880,it three or four is perfect  then drop it into some water
PUrRMtf4cYA,1108880,1112799,make sure it's nice and soaked
PUrRMtf4cYA,1115039,1120320,next squeeze color dye on it  one color per section is good
PUrRMtf4cYA,1120320,1131440,and don't worry if colors bleed past the  bands  [Music]
PUrRMtf4cYA,1131440,1138160,and now just let it dry  [Music]  let's see how it turned out
