8BXG6ojA4l8,12240,15679,hatchback sport touring and we have
8BXG6ojA4l8,15679,18080,joy of joys a six-speed manual
8BXG6ojA4l8,18080,19680,transmission
8BXG6ojA4l8,19680,20800,let's walk around this new civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,20800,22800,hatchback show you what it's like inside
8BXG6ojA4l8,22800,24480,and out we'll take it for a drive and
8BXG6ojA4l8,24480,26240,hopefully give you guys an idea of what
8BXG6ojA4l8,26240,28000,it's like to live with this new
8BXG6ojA4l8,28000,30720,hatchback coming out this year we have a
8BXG6ojA4l8,30720,33680,lot of cargo space in the back of this
8BXG6ojA4l8,33680,34800,actually you know what let's just go
8BXG6ojA4l8,34800,36800,back there and show you around
8BXG6ojA4l8,36800,38559,a few months ago we drove the new civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,38559,41520,sedan and i really really like that car
8BXG6ojA4l8,41520,44719,the cvt was ultra smooth and actually
8BXG6ojA4l8,44719,46800,this manual is pretty good too the
8BXG6ojA4l8,46800,49520,manual is available in both the sport
8BXG6ojA4l8,49520,51600,and the sport touring trims so you can
8BXG6ojA4l8,51600,53680,have it with a base 2-liter naturally
8BXG6ojA4l8,53680,56000,aspirated engine or this turbocharged
8BXG6ojA4l8,56000,57600,1.5 liter
8BXG6ojA4l8,57600,60800,it makes 180 horsepower 177 pound-feet
8BXG6ojA4l8,60800,64080,of torque a little over 3000 pounds it's
8BXG6ojA4l8,64080,65760,rated for 28 miles to the gallon of the
8BXG6ojA4l8,65760,69840,city 37 on the highway
8BXG6ojA4l8,70960,72880,a lot of cargo space
8BXG6ojA4l8,72880,74240,in the back of this hatchback with the
8BXG6ojA4l8,74240,76479,seats folded down like we have now
8BXG6ojA4l8,76479,77840,you can fit all sorts of stuff back here
8BXG6ojA4l8,77840,79200,mountain bikes
8BXG6ojA4l8,79200,80560,furniture
8BXG6ojA4l8,80560,83200,you even get a compact spare tire with a
8BXG6ojA4l8,83200,86320,jack and some other accessories
8BXG6ojA4l8,86320,87840,let's fold these rear seats up show you
8BXG6ojA4l8,87840,91680,what cargo looks like with everything up
8BXG6ojA4l8,91680,94079,a lot of room in the back
8BXG6ojA4l8,94079,96720,seats tons of leg space
8BXG6ojA4l8,96720,99840,this is encroaching upon a cord
8BXG6ojA4l8,99840,101759,levels of interior volume honda always
8BXG6ojA4l8,101759,102960,does a really nice job with their
8BXG6ojA4l8,102960,105840,interior packaging
8BXG6ojA4l8,109040,111280,yeah really nice looking hatchback
8BXG6ojA4l8,111280,113119,the rear end i think
8BXG6ojA4l8,113119,115680,is a bit of a funky design
8BXG6ojA4l8,115680,118000,but i think it still keeps with the rest
8BXG6ojA4l8,118000,120560,of the car
8BXG6ojA4l8,121040,124159,less hatchback and more lift back
8BXG6ojA4l8,124159,127040,this is 4.9 inches shorter than the
8BXG6ojA4l8,127040,129039,sedan and that's all just in the rear
8BXG6ojA4l8,129039,130399,end
8BXG6ojA4l8,130399,132000,the rest of the car is pretty much the
8BXG6ojA4l8,132000,134160,same we have a slightly different
8BXG6ojA4l8,134160,136160,front grille
8BXG6ojA4l8,136160,138080,where the honda badge is located but
8BXG6ojA4l8,138080,139040,really that's kind of the only
8BXG6ojA4l8,139040,141440,difference between this and the sedan
8BXG6ojA4l8,141440,143440,same engine same interior
8BXG6ojA4l8,143440,145360,we have a slightly stiffer rear
8BXG6ojA4l8,145360,147200,suspension setup
8BXG6ojA4l8,147200,148959,a little bit beefier sway bar eight
8BXG6ojA4l8,148959,153239,percent stiffer rear springs
8BXG6ojA4l8,157519,159200,tons of legroom tons of space in the
8BXG6ojA4l8,159200,162239,back of this you get a couple usb ports
8BXG6ojA4l8,162239,164239,a nice arm rest
8BXG6ojA4l8,164239,165840,the leather and the sport touring trim
8BXG6ojA4l8,165840,167360,feels very good
8BXG6ojA4l8,167360,169040,this comes in at twenty nine thousand
8BXG6ojA4l8,169040,171840,four hundred dollars
8BXG6ojA4l8,172080,174959,it's also available in a cvt but
8BXG6ojA4l8,174959,176560,i gotta say this manual is a big
8BXG6ojA4l8,176560,178879,improvement especially over the
8BXG6ojA4l8,178879,181280,honda civic sport
8BXG6ojA4l8,181280,185200,that we had in the previous generation
8BXG6ojA4l8,185200,188159,let's show you under the hood
8BXG6ojA4l8,188640,190640,this is a really nice torquey 1.5 liter
8BXG6ojA4l8,190640,194480,turbo super fuel efficient
8BXG6ojA4l8,194480,196239,spools up very quickly got a lot of
8BXG6ojA4l8,196239,198879,torque down low pulls nicely into the
8BXG6ojA4l8,198879,200159,high revs
8BXG6ojA4l8,200159,201440,doesn't sound like much it's pretty
8BXG6ojA4l8,201440,203920,quiet but at least it's an exposed
8BXG6ojA4l8,203920,205440,engine look how easy this thing is to
8BXG6ojA4l8,205440,206480,work on
8BXG6ojA4l8,206480,209760,turbochargers right there
8BXG6ojA4l8,210720,212400,no engine covers i got to give honda
8BXG6ojA4l8,212400,214799,credit for keeping their engines natural
8BXG6ojA4l8,214799,217200,looking
8BXG6ojA4l8,218480,220879,pretty good looking car in my opinion
8BXG6ojA4l8,220879,223040,i like the front end
8BXG6ojA4l8,223040,225760,the profile looks pretty good too
8BXG6ojA4l8,225760,227920,and look at the stance these wheels are
8BXG6ojA4l8,227920,230159,really pushed out nicely to the edges of
8BXG6ojA4l8,230159,232560,the car
8BXG6ojA4l8,232879,236640,two functional exhaust tips in the back
8BXG6ojA4l8,236640,238080,let's hop up front show you guys around
8BXG6ojA4l8,238080,239680,this interior we'll take this thing for
8BXG6ojA4l8,239680,241840,a drive
8BXG6ojA4l8,242480,244480,we also get a bose sound system in this
8BXG6ojA4l8,244480,247040,new civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,247280,248959,really nice sound system i think it's
8BXG6ojA4l8,248959,250799,slightly better than the mazda cx-30s
8BXG6ojA4l8,250799,251840,bose
8BXG6ojA4l8,251840,253040,it's
8BXG6ojA4l8,253040,254959,up there with some of the best
8BXG6ojA4l8,254959,257359,audio in the industry and for the price
8BXG6ojA4l8,257359,259840,point you can't beat it
8BXG6ojA4l8,259840,261120,we have a couple different drive modes
8BXG6ojA4l8,261120,262800,in this manual trim
8BXG6ojA4l8,262800,264080,eco mode
8BXG6ojA4l8,264080,266800,and eco mode off
8BXG6ojA4l8,266800,267840,i can't really tell the difference
8BXG6ojA4l8,267840,269600,between eco mode and normal mode i think
8BXG6ojA4l8,269600,271040,the throttle is just dulled a little bit
8BXG6ojA4l8,271040,273600,but that's about it
8BXG6ojA4l8,273600,275040,we get a bunch of different honda
8BXG6ojA4l8,275040,277360,sensing and safety features
8BXG6ojA4l8,277360,279280,road departure mitigation blind spot

8BXG6ojA4l8,281600,282479,and
8BXG6ojA4l8,282479,285919,collision mitigation braking
8BXG6ojA4l8,286320,288080,this fully digital gauge cluster is
8BXG6ojA4l8,288080,289680,really nice it's easy to read it's
8BXG6ojA4l8,289680,291440,simple it's sharp
8BXG6ojA4l8,291440,292720,there's not too much information to
8BXG6ojA4l8,292720,295120,distract you you can add
8BXG6ojA4l8,295120,296800,certain things like your fuel economy
8BXG6ojA4l8,296800,300319,your range navigation
8BXG6ojA4l8,300479,302639,who's sitting in your car
8BXG6ojA4l8,302639,304639,maintenance stuff like that to this
8BXG6ojA4l8,304639,305919,right display or you can just choose to
8BXG6ojA4l8,305919,308000,have no content and on the left side you
8BXG6ojA4l8,308000,308840,can

8BXG6ojA4l8,316639,318560,knob a control
8BXG6ojA4l8,318560,320880,no touch haptic feedback stuff except
8BXG6ojA4l8,320880,323120,for the screen and even then you get
8BXG6ojA4l8,323120,324720,physical home and back buttons with a
8BXG6ojA4l8,324720,327840,volume knob track selection
8BXG6ojA4l8,327840,330080,this infotainment is pretty responsive
8BXG6ojA4l8,330080,331520,we have wireless apple carplay and
8BXG6ojA4l8,331520,334080,android auto which is fantastic
8BXG6ojA4l8,334080,335919,touchscreen works great it comes falls
8BXG6ojA4l8,335919,337520,to hand very easily
8BXG6ojA4l8,337520,339759,position next to the steering wheel

8BXG6ojA4l8,357120,359360,setup
8BXG6ojA4l8,359360,360880,take a look at this manual transmission
8BXG6ojA4l8,360880,362639,it's a lot stiffer
8BXG6ojA4l8,362639,364319,and a lot tighter than the previous
8BXG6ojA4l8,364319,366240,generation i liken the 10th generation
8BXG6ojA4l8,366240,369120,civics manual to
8BXG6ojA4l8,369120,371919,a logitech shifter i wasn't a fan this
8BXG6ojA4l8,371919,373440,is a big improvement i'll show you guys
8BXG6ojA4l8,373440,375440,what it's like on the road here soon
8BXG6ojA4l8,375440,377600,a lot of nice cargo space decently sized
8BXG6ojA4l8,377600,379759,cup holders
8BXG6ojA4l8,379759,381600,there's the glove box
8BXG6ojA4l8,381600,383199,these vent controls are really nice just
8BXG6ojA4l8,383199,386400,a a simple easy to use user-friendly
8BXG6ojA4l8,386400,389759,minimal interior and that kind of
8BXG6ojA4l8,389759,391520,plays out to the rest of the vehicle too
8BXG6ojA4l8,391520,393360,honda has gone a really nice direction
8BXG6ojA4l8,393360,396240,with this new civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,396560,398240,we've got a decent reverse camera pretty
8BXG6ojA4l8,398240,400639,wide angle you can adjust your view
8BXG6ojA4l8,400639,401759,angle there
8BXG6ojA4l8,401759,403840,not the highest resolution
8BXG6ojA4l8,403840,405600,or prettiest display but it shows you
8BXG6ojA4l8,405600,407199,what you need to see
8BXG6ojA4l8,407199,410240,turning lines too which is always great
8BXG6ojA4l8,410240,412080,electronic parking brake it will
8BXG6ojA4l8,412080,414080,disengage automatically
8BXG6ojA4l8,414080,416639,as soon as you set off which is nice
8BXG6ojA4l8,416639,418720,we've got a great little spot here to
8BXG6ojA4l8,418720,421039,charge our phone with wireless charging
8BXG6ojA4l8,421039,424080,we get a couple usb ports too a 12 volt
8BXG6ojA4l8,424080,427120,180 watt cigarette lighter port
8BXG6ojA4l8,427120,428639,comfortable seats
8BXG6ojA4l8,428639,430080,a good amount of storage in the door
8BXG6ojA4l8,430080,431360,pockets
8BXG6ojA4l8,431360,433280,auto up down windows for the front two
8BXG6ojA4l8,433280,437840,windows parking sensors traction control
8BXG6ojA4l8,438639,440080,a little place to put your sunglasses up
8BXG6ojA4l8,440080,440880,here
8BXG6ojA4l8,440880,443840,there's the sunroof
8BXG6ojA4l8,444639,447360,you can tilt
8BXG6ojA4l8,447520,451479,or push it all the way back
8BXG6ojA4l8,457520,459919,those move to block the sun
8BXG6ojA4l8,459919,461280,all right i think it's a walk around
8BXG6ojA4l8,461280,465080,let's take this thing for a drive
8BXG6ojA4l8,466960,472000,so clutch pedal super lightweight
8BXG6ojA4l8,472160,473919,not a lot of feel at the engagement
8BXG6ojA4l8,473919,475120,point but
8BXG6ojA4l8,475120,478400,about average for most modern manual
8BXG6ojA4l8,478400,481599,transmissions in this class
8BXG6ojA4l8,481680,484479,the steering is light
8BXG6ojA4l8,484479,486400,this car feels taut
8BXG6ojA4l8,486400,489520,and well planted
8BXG6ojA4l8,490319,493840,like i mentioned earlier
8BXG6ojA4l8,494319,497039,torque comes on pretty early
8BXG6ojA4l8,497039,498639,down low on the power band in this new
8BXG6ojA4l8,498639,499919,civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,499919,502960,this is a great engine
8BXG6ojA4l8,503120,506400,and paired with a 6-speed manual
8BXG6ojA4l8,506400,508000,it's pretty fun to drive
8BXG6ojA4l8,508000,511440,it's not quite a civic si
8BXG6ojA4l8,511520,513760,but it's a really nice
8BXG6ojA4l8,513760,516479,in-between
8BXG6ojA4l8,517360,518640,decently quick
8BXG6ojA4l8,518640,521279,180 horsepower goes a long way in this
8BXG6ojA4l8,521279,522399,car
8BXG6ojA4l8,522399,523839,the pedals are well positioned for heel
8BXG6ojA4l8,523839,526720,toe downshifting
8BXG6ojA4l8,528399,531120,we've got a little bit of rev hang
8BXG6ojA4l8,531120,534600,in the higher rpms
8BXG6ojA4l8,540959,543760,but your inputs here feel really nice i
8BXG6ojA4l8,543760,545519,like the steering feel
8BXG6ojA4l8,545519,548880,it weights up nicely around a corner
8BXG6ojA4l8,548880,550240,and i actually really like the shifter
8BXG6ojA4l8,550240,552640,feel here this is honda doing a nice job
8BXG6ojA4l8,552640,556160,with their shifter in this car again
8BXG6ojA4l8,557680,559680,it's just notchy enough it's a bit of a
8BXG6ojA4l8,559680,563839,shorter throw too which i appreciate
8BXG6ojA4l8,568399,569839,engine is nice and responsive too it
8BXG6ojA4l8,569839,572000,responds well to
8BXG6ojA4l8,572000,575720,rev match downshifts
8BXG6ojA4l8,576640,578399,there's quite a bit of rev hang which is
8BXG6ojA4l8,578399,580160,to be expected
8BXG6ojA4l8,580160,581920,nothing's changed in the last decade
8BXG6ojA4l8,581920,584880,with regards to that
8BXG6ojA4l8,585839,588240,but still that said it's not terrible
8BXG6ojA4l8,588240,591279,and it's not a deal breaker
8BXG6ojA4l8,591279,593519,driving this car around for the last
8BXG6ojA4l8,593519,595680,30 40 minutes or so it's
8BXG6ojA4l8,595680,597440,gotten more accustomed and more attuned
8BXG6ojA4l8,597440,600000,to my driving style
8BXG6ojA4l8,600000,603800,let's do a quick break test
8BXG6ojA4l8,604720,606320,oh yeah it feels good let's turn off
8BXG6ojA4l8,606320,608240,traction control and we'll do a zero to
8BXG6ojA4l8,608240,611240,sixty
8BXG6ojA4l8,612790,615940,[Music]
8BXG6ojA4l8,618079,622320,gear tops out about 55 miles per hour
8BXG6ojA4l8,624880,628320,turn everything back on there
8BXG6ojA4l8,628800,632360,decently quick
8BXG6ojA4l8,633120,634880,guys this is kind of one of the last
8BXG6ojA4l8,634880,637279,manual transmission hatchbacks
8BXG6ojA4l8,637279,639200,on sale these days
8BXG6ojA4l8,639200,641680,i really applaud honda for
8BXG6ojA4l8,641680,643839,selling this in both the sport and sport
8BXG6ojA4l8,643839,645519,touring trims it's so nice to be able to
8BXG6ojA4l8,645519,647839,get this with both engine configurations
8BXG6ojA4l8,647839,649760,and get this in a pretty much fully
8BXG6ojA4l8,649760,651040,loaded car
8BXG6ojA4l8,651040,652399,really the only thing you're missing out
8BXG6ojA4l8,652399,653600,on
8BXG6ojA4l8,653600,656320,in this manual civic hatchback are just
8BXG6ojA4l8,656320,658880,some of the honda sensing features
8BXG6ojA4l8,658880,660720,can't quite do the same things that it
8BXG6ojA4l8,660720,662079,can with an automatic transmission
8BXG6ojA4l8,662079,663920,because there's a clutch pedal and
8BXG6ojA4l8,663920,665920,you as the driver and the car wouldn't
8BXG6ojA4l8,665920,667120,want to bring itself all the way down
8BXG6ojA4l8,667120,668560,from speed and stall that would be
8BXG6ojA4l8,668560,670560,pretty dangerous so we've got some we've
8BXG6ojA4l8,670560,671839,got some concessions that we have to
8BXG6ojA4l8,671839,673360,make for the manual but overall i think
8BXG6ojA4l8,673360,675680,if you're an enthusiast and you want a
8BXG6ojA4l8,675680,677760,fun daily driver commuter that's
8BXG6ojA4l8,677760,680880,efficient and well priced
8BXG6ojA4l8,680880,682399,guys this is the best option on the
8BXG6ojA4l8,682399,684160,market
8BXG6ojA4l8,684160,685440,i definitely take one of these over at
8BXG6ojA4l8,685440,686880,corolla i think it's a bit more fun to
8BXG6ojA4l8,686880,690079,drive definitely quicker
8BXG6ojA4l8,692560,695680,much more spacious
8BXG6ojA4l8,698959,700880,this 1.5 turbo really does have a
8BXG6ojA4l8,700880,704079,satisfying pull to it
8BXG6ojA4l8,706480,708399,the front end of this car just feels
8BXG6ojA4l8,708399,710160,awesome
8BXG6ojA4l8,710160,712959,so sharp
8BXG6ojA4l8,713600,716560,really darts into a corner nicely get a
8BXG6ojA4l8,716560,718959,hint of understeer on throttle but
8BXG6ojA4l8,718959,720560,overall for a front wheel drive car this
8BXG6ojA4l8,720560,724560,is a really nice neutral chassis
8BXG6ojA4l8,724560,726160,the ride's a little bit stiffer than the
8BXG6ojA4l8,726160,727760,sedan but
8BXG6ojA4l8,727760,729519,i don't know if you would notice it too
8BXG6ojA4l8,729519,731360,much back to back
8BXG6ojA4l8,731360,732639,just that rear end is a little bit
8BXG6ojA4l8,732639,734320,tighter gives this car a bit more
8BXG6ojA4l8,734320,736480,rotation and
8BXG6ojA4l8,736480,740720,a more active chassis which i appreciate
8BXG6ojA4l8,742800,745600,i believe it's a solid rear sway bar
8BXG6ojA4l8,745600,747760,slightly tweaked from the sedan and we
8BXG6ojA4l8,747760,750079,have eight percent stiffer spring rates
8BXG6ojA4l8,750079,754760,in this hatch all across the board
8BXG6ojA4l8,761279,762720,my question is
8BXG6ojA4l8,762720,764079,if this
8BXG6ojA4l8,764079,766720,civic sport is this good to drive what's
8BXG6ojA4l8,766720,768639,the civic si going to be like
8BXG6ojA4l8,768639,770639,and then what's the civic type r going
8BXG6ojA4l8,770639,773120,to be like this is a really
8BXG6ojA4l8,773120,774560,really great starting point for the
8BXG6ojA4l8,774560,776639,civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,776639,778240,if you're not interested in the si this
8BXG6ojA4l8,778240,780320,is a fantastic option
8BXG6ojA4l8,780320,783760,the handling here the chassis
8BXG6ojA4l8,784320,785839,it's really not much you can improve
8BXG6ojA4l8,785839,787440,upon it
8BXG6ojA4l8,787440,790160,except for maybe a stickier tire
8BXG6ojA4l8,790160,792079,so one quick note with tires and nvh
8BXG6ojA4l8,792079,793839,with this new civic hatchback this does
8BXG6ojA4l8,793839,796399,have a different continental tire on it
8BXG6ojA4l8,796399,798480,than the civic sedan i believe the civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,798480,800560,center had good years and there was
8BXG6ojA4l8,800560,803120,quite a bit of impact noise and nvh over
8BXG6ojA4l8,803120,804880,bumps and you'll notice in this drive
8BXG6ojA4l8,804880,806959,that the civic hatchback is considerably
8BXG6ojA4l8,806959,808959,quieter over rough pavement than the
8BXG6ojA4l8,808959,811120,sedan is that's partially due to some
8BXG6ojA4l8,811120,813120,more sound insulation throughout the car
8BXG6ojA4l8,813120,815360,but also that tire change makes a big
8BXG6ojA4l8,815360,816480,difference so
8BXG6ojA4l8,816480,817839,one of my only complaints about the
8BXG6ojA4l8,817839,820160,sedan i think has been addressed pretty
8BXG6ojA4l8,820160,822160,well here with this hatchback with this
8BXG6ojA4l8,822160,825040,continental tire and the extra headed
8BXG6ojA4l8,825040,826959,sound insulation if you compare both
8BXG6ojA4l8,826959,829680,videos you'll see that in this drive
8BXG6ojA4l8,829680,830880,really kind of struggling to come up
8BXG6ojA4l8,830880,834000,with any complaints about this new civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,834000,836880,it's such a great overall car it looks
8BXG6ojA4l8,836880,838639,great
8BXG6ojA4l8,838639,840160,functionally
8BXG6ojA4l8,840160,842000,fantastic
8BXG6ojA4l8,842000,844800,very user friendly easy to live with
8BXG6ojA4l8,844800,846560,the performance here is really nice it's
8BXG6ojA4l8,846560,847839,fun to drive
8BXG6ojA4l8,847839,850560,it's a little bit quiet
8BXG6ojA4l8,850560,852320,has its pros and cons and you can always
8BXG6ojA4l8,852320,855040,make things louder with the aftermarket
8BXG6ojA4l8,855040,857040,the rev hang isn't awesome but it's to
8BXG6ojA4l8,857040,859360,be expected from honda and also
8BXG6ojA4l8,859360,861680,it's still a fun car to drive with it
8BXG6ojA4l8,861680,862880,just got to let that clutch out a little
8BXG6ojA4l8,862880,865360,bit sooner
8BXG6ojA4l8,866160,868480,there's a bit of tire noise over
8BXG6ojA4l8,868480,869760,potholes
8BXG6ojA4l8,869760,872000,but it's not bad i feel like this is
8BXG6ojA4l8,872000,873279,maybe a little bit quieter than the
8BXG6ojA4l8,873279,875279,sedan was over bumps i'm gonna have to
8BXG6ojA4l8,875279,876639,live with it for a little bit this week
8BXG6ojA4l8,876639,877519,but
8BXG6ojA4l8,877519,878959,you can have a conversation in here it's
8BXG6ojA4l8,878959,880720,fine
8BXG6ojA4l8,880720,882240,we're on a pretty rough road right now
8BXG6ojA4l8,882240,883600,and
8BXG6ojA4l8,883600,885920,it's not like we're driving on run flats
8BXG6ojA4l8,885920,888560,it doesn't sound like that
8BXG6ojA4l8,888560,890639,off throttle there's not a lot of engine
8BXG6ojA4l8,890639,893639,braking
8BXG6ojA4l8,899839,901760,the relationship between the way the
8BXG6ojA4l8,901760,903680,engine builds boost
8BXG6ojA4l8,903680,907360,the pedals the shifter
8BXG6ojA4l8,908800,910480,it's a pretty pleasurable driving
8BXG6ojA4l8,910480,911760,experience
8BXG6ojA4l8,911760,913519,i'm impressed you guys i didn't really
8BXG6ojA4l8,913519,914959,know what to expect with this new civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,914959,916560,hatch manual
8BXG6ojA4l8,916560,917680,and getting behind the wheel and
8BXG6ojA4l8,917680,919360,spending some time with it this is a fun
8BXG6ojA4l8,919360,922680,little car
8BXG6ojA4l8,927120,928800,i think what the si and the type bar
8BXG6ojA4l8,928800,930639,will just build upon this is just add
8BXG6ojA4l8,930639,932959,more excitement more boost
8BXG6ojA4l8,932959,935519,better engine sounds
8BXG6ojA4l8,935519,937680,hopefully they don't ruin uh
8BXG6ojA4l8,937680,939600,the engine pipe didn't sound like they
8BXG6ojA4l8,939600,941759,did with the previous si
8BXG6ojA4l8,941759,942959,in the new one we're going to test that
8BXG6ojA4l8,942959,944800,out in a few weeks
8BXG6ojA4l8,944800,946160,heading out to california to drive the
8BXG6ojA4l8,946160,947279,new si
8BXG6ojA4l8,947279,949279,and i have high hopes after driving the
8BXG6ojA4l8,949279,952839,civic sport hatchback
8BXG6ojA4l8,964800,968680,you can even heal toe
8BXG6ojA4l8,969540,972240,[Music]
8BXG6ojA4l8,972240,975040,and that last thousand rpm you
8BXG6ojA4l8,975040,976240,almost
8BXG6ojA4l8,976240,978079,feel like you could hear a hint of vtec
8BXG6ojA4l8,978079,982440,but of course there isn't any
8BXG6ojA4l8,982800,985519,but the engine just kind of comes on
8BXG6ojA4l8,985519,988480,gets a little bit louder which is nice
8BXG6ojA4l8,988480,989839,get a slight vibration through the
8BXG6ojA4l8,989839,992480,steering wheel
8BXG6ojA4l8,994480,996480,below 5000 rpm the rev hang actually
8BXG6ojA4l8,996480,998560,isn't too bad
8BXG6ojA4l8,998560,999920,it's really when you get up into those
8BXG6ojA4l8,999920,1002079,higher revs
8BXG6ojA4l8,1002079,1005360,is where it presents itself
8BXG6ojA4l8,1008480,1010880,but you guys can see it as soon as i let
8BXG6ojA4l8,1010880,1011680,off
8BXG6ojA4l8,1011680,1013440,the gas put the clutch pedal on the revs
8BXG6ojA4l8,1013440,1015600,are still dropping relatively quickly i
8BXG6ojA4l8,1015600,1016639,think it might even be a little bit of
8BXG6ojA4l8,1016639,1018160,an improvement over previous generation
8BXG6ojA4l8,1018160,1021160,civics
8BXG6ojA4l8,1036400,1037760,there's no auto wrap matching in this
8BXG6ojA4l8,1037760,1041120,car you have to do it all yourself
8BXG6ojA4l8,1050799,1052080,definitely another feature that the
8BXG6ojA4l8,1052080,1053760,civic si
8BXG6ojA4l8,1053760,1057120,and or civic type r will add
8BXG6ojA4l8,1057120,1059679,brakes feel really nice too
8BXG6ojA4l8,1059679,1061200,pretty stiff pedal very positive
8BXG6ojA4l8,1061200,1062480,engagement
8BXG6ojA4l8,1062480,1065120,nice bite
8BXG6ojA4l8,1065600,1067679,this still has the same wheelbase as the
8BXG6ojA4l8,1067679,1070080,sedan but that shorter overhang on the
8BXG6ojA4l8,1070080,1071120,rear end
8BXG6ojA4l8,1071120,1072640,gives this car a little bit more of a
8BXG6ojA4l8,1072640,1074480,flickable fun
8BXG6ojA4l8,1074480,1078120,feel around the corners
8BXG6ojA4l8,1091520,1093520,the wiper nozzles are integrated inside
8BXG6ojA4l8,1093520,1096720,the wiper that's always cool
8BXG6ojA4l8,1107200,1108960,yeah the handling here is just super
8BXG6ojA4l8,1108960,1111960,impressive
8BXG6ojA4l8,1134400,1135840,the thing i like most about the civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,1135840,1138240,hatchback is that it's a fluid car to
8BXG6ojA4l8,1138240,1140080,drive with the manual transmission
8BXG6ojA4l8,1140080,1141679,that's kind of one of my biggest
8BXG6ojA4l8,1141679,1143520,concerns about any new car that comes
8BXG6ojA4l8,1143520,1144960,out with the manual is
8BXG6ojA4l8,1144960,1146240,has
8BXG6ojA4l8,1146240,1148320,the company done the due diligence and
8BXG6ojA4l8,1148320,1150240,done the development to make it a good
8BXG6ojA4l8,1150240,1151919,manual transmission
8BXG6ojA4l8,1151919,1153520,it's gonna have a pretty low take rate
8BXG6ojA4l8,1153520,1155919,from buyers only five to ten percent
8BXG6ojA4l8,1155919,1157280,probably
8BXG6ojA4l8,1157280,1159360,and i think made the effort to make it a
8BXG6ojA4l8,1159360,1160960,good manual
8BXG6ojA4l8,1160960,1163360,and i'm glad to report that honda has
8BXG6ojA4l8,1163360,1164720,this manual transmission feels great
8BXG6ojA4l8,1164720,1166480,it's a fluid
8BXG6ojA4l8,1166480,1168559,natural driving experience
8BXG6ojA4l8,1168559,1170640,all of your inputs work and correspond
8BXG6ojA4l8,1170640,1173120,nicely
8BXG6ojA4l8,1176480,1178799,when i take the manual over the cvt
8BXG6ojA4l8,1178799,1181039,personally yeah i probably would the cvt
8BXG6ojA4l8,1181039,1182880,is really nice in this car though it's a
8BXG6ojA4l8,1182880,1186080,fantastic transmission
8BXG6ojA4l8,1188320,1190400,it is great being able to row your own
8BXG6ojA4l8,1190400,1191919,gears and just having control over
8BXG6ojA4l8,1191919,1195759,everything though with this six speed
8BXG6ojA4l8,1195810,1198000,[Music]
8BXG6ojA4l8,1198000,1201799,see how it handles a roundabout
8BXG6ojA4l8,1204570,1207820,[Music]
8BXG6ojA4l8,1209360,1212159,oh yeah nice rotation
8BXG6ojA4l8,1212159,1215799,very little understeer
8BXG6ojA4l8,1238240,1239520,this would be a fun little autocross
8BXG6ojA4l8,1239520,1242840,card too
8BXG6ojA4l8,1243920,1247059,[Music]

8BXG6ojA4l8,1267440,1268799,touring trim
8BXG6ojA4l8,1268799,1270480,this is all kind of all you'd really
8BXG6ojA4l8,1270480,1272559,want out of a daily driver
8BXG6ojA4l8,1272559,1274240,very excited
8BXG6ojA4l8,1274240,1275679,to drive this car and experience it

8BXG6ojA4l8,1277440,1278799,and it gave you a good idea of what this
8BXG6ojA4l8,1278799,1281600,thing is like behind the wheel
8BXG6ojA4l8,1281600,1284480,gonna see a sound system test stay tuned
