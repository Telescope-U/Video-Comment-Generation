RT0f69MKW0k,28480,31840,chips definitely
RT0f69MKW0k,35460,50979,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,51680,53760,when my ultimate dual sport rebuild
RT0f69MKW0k,53760,56399,project was delayed because i
RT0f69MKW0k,56399,59199,blew up the motor i needed another bike
RT0f69MKW0k,59199,62480,asap to host last fall's rally season
RT0f69MKW0k,62480,65680,well finding any bike new or used was
RT0f69MKW0k,65680,68560,nearly impossible dealerships were sold
RT0f69MKW0k,68560,70640,out of bikes before they even arrived in
RT0f69MKW0k,70640,72880,the showroom and used bikes were being
RT0f69MKW0k,72880,75200,sold sight unseen for more than asking
RT0f69MKW0k,75200,77840,price within minutes of listing
RT0f69MKW0k,77840,80080,the only bike at the dealership that
RT0f69MKW0k,80080,82880,wasn't sold yet the most expensive dual
RT0f69MKW0k,82880,85360,sport motorcycle in production
RT0f69MKW0k,85360,91650,this 2022 ktm 500 six days
RT0f69MKW0k,91650,100390,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,100400,104159,there it sat behind the counter 13 000
RT0f69MKW0k,104159,107360,price tag glistening like a 1990s bag of
RT0f69MKW0k,107360,110720,doritos and i knew i had to have it
RT0f69MKW0k,110720,112399,because i needed something street legal
RT0f69MKW0k,112399,114079,with decent range and there was
RT0f69MKW0k,114079,117040,literally nothing else so i pillaged my
RT0f69MKW0k,117040,119360,kids college funds sold the spare man
RT0f69MKW0k,119360,121759,mcnugget on the black market and before
RT0f69MKW0k,121759,123680,i knew it i was loading the most
RT0f69MKW0k,123680,125920,expensive dual sport motorcycle in the
RT0f69MKW0k,125920,126880,world
RT0f69MKW0k,126880,128720,into the back of my truck
RT0f69MKW0k,128720,131200,and you can see it on my face it was at
RT0f69MKW0k,131200,134319,this moment that he knew
RT0f69MKW0k,135090,140639,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,141520,144239,thirteen thousand dollars seems a stupid
RT0f69MKW0k,144239,146560,amount of money to spend on a dual sport
RT0f69MKW0k,146560,149120,motorcycle this bike alone was more than
RT0f69MKW0k,149120,151920,the sum total of all dual sports and
RT0f69MKW0k,151920,154400,dirt bikes i have ever owned
RT0f69MKW0k,154400,157599,so let's cut back to the fall of 2021
RT0f69MKW0k,157599,159599,when this bike had literally just
RT0f69MKW0k,159599,162319,chainsaw massacred my kids college fund
RT0f69MKW0k,162319,164319,when i recorded my first impressions of
RT0f69MKW0k,164319,167680,the bike and ktm fanboys be forewarned
RT0f69MKW0k,167680,170480,it's not pretty but take it easy because
RT0f69MKW0k,170480,172800,buyer's remorse was still gutting me at
RT0f69MKW0k,172800,173760,the time
RT0f69MKW0k,173760,176080,and maybe after owning it through two
RT0f69MKW0k,176080,178480,rally seasons and accumulating many many
RT0f69MKW0k,178480,179440,miles
RT0f69MKW0k,179440,181840,maybe i gained a different perspective
RT0f69MKW0k,181840,184800,about this motorcycle today i have the
RT0f69MKW0k,184800,187200,most expensive motorcycle dual sport
RT0f69MKW0k,187200,188879,motorcycle anyway
RT0f69MKW0k,188879,190879,on the market today to my knowledge
RT0f69MKW0k,190879,192400,first of all let's talk about the six
RT0f69MKW0k,192400,196400,days trim i guess you'd call it
RT0f69MKW0k,196480,197360,this
RT0f69MKW0k,197360,198959,you know
RT0f69MKW0k,198959,202239,uh it looks like a dorito um which i'm
RT0f69MKW0k,202239,204480,i'm i'm weirdly drawn to stuff like that
RT0f69MKW0k,204480,206640,i guess my first dual sport motorcycle
RT0f69MKW0k,206640,209120,was a kawasaki klr 650 that looked a lot
RT0f69MKW0k,209120,211360,like this actually except for a lot more
RT0f69MKW0k,211360,213360,purple and pink
RT0f69MKW0k,213360,216480,and uh and teal but this bike has it all
RT0f69MKW0k,216480,219200,purple pink teal yellow orange of course
RT0f69MKW0k,219200,221040,the tricky part about the six days trim
RT0f69MKW0k,221040,223040,is you want to keep it really nice and i
RT0f69MKW0k,223040,224640,went through a river crossing to get
RT0f69MKW0k,224640,226640,here spat up mud all over the bike and
RT0f69MKW0k,226640,228239,it's like oh
RT0f69MKW0k,228239,230000,and you shouldn't feel that way about a
RT0f69MKW0k,230000,232000,dual sport it just so happens that on a
RT0f69MKW0k,232000,234560,13 000 dual sport that really just
RT0f69MKW0k,234560,237040,destroyed your bank account you kind of
RT0f69MKW0k,237040,239519,can't help but feel that way so here's
RT0f69MKW0k,239519,242640,what's going on um this seat is abysmal
RT0f69MKW0k,242640,244640,i'll need to replace the seat also i
RT0f69MKW0k,244640,246560,want to keep this seat pristine because
RT0f69MKW0k,246560,248560,this is i guess a collector's bike or
RT0f69MKW0k,248560,250879,some something like that i
RT0f69MKW0k,250879,252239,it's kind of the
RT0f69MKW0k,252239,255280,the antithesis antithesis the epitome
RT0f69MKW0k,255280,257759,the epitome it's the epitome of what i
RT0f69MKW0k,257759,260479,don't like about dual sports let's keep
RT0f69MKW0k,260479,263040,it pristine let's keep it perfect and so
RT0f69MKW0k,263040,265360,that we can resell it or or you know
RT0f69MKW0k,265360,267040,it's just a garage queen now this thing
RT0f69MKW0k,267040,268720,sit sat in my garage for a week because
RT0f69MKW0k,268720,270320,i didn't dare ride it and finally i'm
RT0f69MKW0k,270320,271840,like i gotta get out i got to make the
RT0f69MKW0k,271840,272880,review
RT0f69MKW0k,272880,274880,and i wanted to show the taco bell trim
RT0f69MKW0k,274880,276320,the dorito trim i don't know what
RT0f69MKW0k,276320,277600,whatever you want to call it you can't
RT0f69MKW0k,277600,279280,deny it looks like a doritos commercial
RT0f69MKW0k,279280,283120,from the 90s step into crunch ktm 506
RT0f69MKW0k,283120,285280,days like
RT0f69MKW0k,285280,286320,let's talk about the things that i've
RT0f69MKW0k,286320,288400,got to do this bike right off the bat
RT0f69MKW0k,288400,289919,first of all i actually really like the
RT0f69MKW0k,289919,292080,exhaust i'm like an old man i like the
RT0f69MKW0k,292080,293840,quiet exhaust i think that's really good
RT0f69MKW0k,293840,295840,tank is coming off the seat's coming off
RT0f69MKW0k,295840,296960,the plastics are coming off the
RT0f69MKW0k,296960,298320,handlebar is coming off the grips are
RT0f69MKW0k,298320,299840,coming off the tires are coming off
RT0f69MKW0k,299840,301199,these frame guards are coming off the
RT0f69MKW0k,301199,302240,headlight i don't know what the
RT0f69MKW0k,302240,303840,headlight is on this but i'm guessing
RT0f69MKW0k,303840,306479,it's garbage because i think ktm likes
RT0f69MKW0k,306479,308400,to
RT0f69MKW0k,308400,310400,help their partners in the aftermarket
RT0f69MKW0k,310400,312320,space it's kind of a i scratch your back
RT0f69MKW0k,312320,314080,you scratch mine type of thing it feels
RT0f69MKW0k,314080,315759,like because a lot of the stuff even on
RT0f69MKW0k,315759,318080,their most expensive model this thirteen
RT0f69MKW0k,318080,320080,thousand dollar six days
RT0f69MKW0k,320080,322000,isn't very good like these mirrors for
RT0f69MKW0k,322000,324960,example are just
RT0f69MKW0k,324960,326320,you know these are kind of a joke and
RT0f69MKW0k,326320,328720,always have been the seat's awful you
RT0f69MKW0k,328720,330800,basically just the tires are worthless
RT0f69MKW0k,330800,332560,you kind of have to replace a lot of
RT0f69MKW0k,332560,333919,stuff before you have a bike that you're
RT0f69MKW0k,333919,335039,going to like
RT0f69MKW0k,335039,338160,and when you pay 13 000 for the upgraded
RT0f69MKW0k,338160,340320,ultimate version
RT0f69MKW0k,340320,342800,then why in the world
RT0f69MKW0k,342800,344960,am i still having to replace everything
RT0f69MKW0k,344960,345840,um
RT0f69MKW0k,345840,347680,so yeah i mean here's a walk around the
RT0f69MKW0k,347680,349280,bike
RT0f69MKW0k,349280,350840,i don't know what i'm doing
RT0f69MKW0k,350840,354160,now it's fine it's fine
RT0f69MKW0k,354160,356720,do i regret buying it yes
RT0f69MKW0k,356720,359720,actually
RT0f69MKW0k,360260,367120,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,367120,369440,okay so my first impressions
RT0f69MKW0k,369440,371840,not overly positive and before we get
RT0f69MKW0k,371840,374400,into my ownership experience let's get
RT0f69MKW0k,374400,376319,to some of the paper facts and figures
RT0f69MKW0k,376319,377280,that are
RT0f69MKW0k,377280,378880,in all honesty
RT0f69MKW0k,378880,380880,not that flattering for a bike this
RT0f69MKW0k,380880,383520,expensive gas mileage i got anywhere
RT0f69MKW0k,383520,386080,from 40 to 50 miles per gallon depending
RT0f69MKW0k,386080,388160,on the riding that's pretty standard for
RT0f69MKW0k,388160,391360,most dual sports in the 4 to 500 range
RT0f69MKW0k,391360,393360,according to the always factual and
RT0f69MKW0k,393360,396759,never airing internet the ktm 500 boasts
RT0f69MKW0k,396759,400960,39.4 horsepower and 27.7 foot-pounds of
RT0f69MKW0k,400960,403199,torque now just for reference a bike
RT0f69MKW0k,403199,405360,that most people are familiar with a
RT0f69MKW0k,405360,408800,stock drz-400 has just six horses less
RT0f69MKW0k,408800,412080,and just two foot-pounds of torque less
RT0f69MKW0k,412080,414000,suspension travel is pretty close to
RT0f69MKW0k,414000,416800,most other dual sports as well 11.8
RT0f69MKW0k,416800,419680,inches in the front 12.2 inches in the
RT0f69MKW0k,419680,423360,rear again for comparison a drz has .4
RT0f69MKW0k,423360,426160,inch less travel in the front and .6
RT0f69MKW0k,426160,428479,less travel in the rear
RT0f69MKW0k,428479,431360,ground clearance is 14 inches 2 inches
RT0f69MKW0k,431360,434240,more than a drz-400 clearance is helped
RT0f69MKW0k,434240,436880,a lot by the ktm's pds system that
RT0f69MKW0k,436880,439599,deletes the linkage which i love on my
RT0f69MKW0k,439599,442800,ktm 300xcw and i love it on this bike as
RT0f69MKW0k,442800,443680,well
RT0f69MKW0k,443680,447039,seat height on the ktm is 38 inches an
RT0f69MKW0k,447039,450400,inch higher than a drz maintenance wise
RT0f69MKW0k,450400,452800,according to the forum that i lazily
RT0f69MKW0k,452800,456240,googled after 135 hours the ktm 500
RT0f69MKW0k,456240,458880,needs my new piston valves valve springs
RT0f69MKW0k,458880,461280,valve spring seats connecting rod conrod
RT0f69MKW0k,461280,463120,bearing and crank pin
RT0f69MKW0k,463120,464639,the drz
RT0f69MKW0k,464639,467360,ah well i never replaced any of that and
RT0f69MKW0k,467360,469440,went somewhere in the neighborhood of 60
RT0f69MKW0k,469440,473039,000 to 80 000 trouble free miles with it
RT0f69MKW0k,473039,474879,until it was crushed by a side by side
RT0f69MKW0k,474879,476720,which ultimately resulted in the
RT0f69MKW0k,476720,480160,purchase of this ktm the ktm 500 stock
RT0f69MKW0k,480160,483599,tank is 2.25 gallons and like i've
RT0f69MKW0k,483599,485759,stated in past reviews of bikes like
RT0f69MKW0k,485759,488720,honda's 450l while adequate for a track
RT0f69MKW0k,488720,491360,ripping dirt bike that's not acceptable
RT0f69MKW0k,491360,493680,for a dual sport on a day of hard riding
RT0f69MKW0k,493680,495759,that would get you a hair over 80 miles
RT0f69MKW0k,495759,497280,before empty
RT0f69MKW0k,497280,499520,now obviously a big question is
RT0f69MKW0k,499520,501680,reliability and long-term maintenance
RT0f69MKW0k,501680,504000,which i can't speak for yet i haven't
RT0f69MKW0k,504000,506960,had a single problem with this 500 in
RT0f69MKW0k,506960,508479,two rally seasons
RT0f69MKW0k,508479,511599,only time will tell if my 500 is truly
RT0f69MKW0k,511599,513599,bomb proof but forgive me
RT0f69MKW0k,513599,516159,if i'm not sold on ktm's long-term
RT0f69MKW0k,516159,518640,reliability i'm unsure if it's from
RT0f69MKW0k,518640,521360,years of lurking in forums and hearing
RT0f69MKW0k,521360,523518,ktm horror stories
RT0f69MKW0k,523518,525839,the frightening lack of older ktm bikes
RT0f69MKW0k,525839,528080,still showing up on the trail or in
RT0f69MKW0k,528080,530640,classifieds or having a myriad of
RT0f69MKW0k,530640,533200,problems with my own ktm bikes in the
RT0f69MKW0k,533200,536640,past now this is pure speculation but i
RT0f69MKW0k,536640,539360,have a weaseling suspicion that ktm is
RT0f69MKW0k,539360,541680,following the likes of
RT0f69MKW0k,541680,543680,pretty much every other monolithic
RT0f69MKW0k,543680,545760,company that builds a physical product
RT0f69MKW0k,545760,548959,these days and sneaking in some kind of
RT0f69MKW0k,548959,551200,planned obsolescence or at the very
RT0f69MKW0k,551200,554160,least a dependence on factory service
RT0f69MKW0k,554160,556320,if you want a prime example of when this
RT0f69MKW0k,556320,558399,started to happen take a look at my
RT0f69MKW0k,558399,562160,video of why ktm killed off the 1190.
RT0f69MKW0k,562160,564480,now switching gears what does the extra
RT0f69MKW0k,564480,566959,money for the super special six days
RT0f69MKW0k,566959,570160,version get for you well a thin plastic
RT0f69MKW0k,570160,571920,skid plate which you'll want to replace
RT0f69MKW0k,571920,575200,anyway a big solid rear brake disc a
RT0f69MKW0k,575200,577519,safety wire on the brake pedal a billet
RT0f69MKW0k,577519,579920,front axle puller which you can get on
RT0f69MKW0k,579920,582000,ebay for 17
RT0f69MKW0k,582000,584160,a slightly less crappy seat which you'll
RT0f69MKW0k,584160,585920,want to swap for something that doesn't
RT0f69MKW0k,585920,588240,require a prescription for hemorrhoid
RT0f69MKW0k,588240,589120,cream
RT0f69MKW0k,589120,591920,aside from undeniably charming doritos
RT0f69MKW0k,591920,594320,graphics you get a bright orange frame
RT0f69MKW0k,594320,596959,and cnc fork clamps and in case those
RT0f69MKW0k,596959,599760,don't scream ktm enough it's got six
RT0f69MKW0k,599760,602320,days logos on the exhaust rims and
RT0f69MKW0k,602320,604880,handlebar so with all that said after
RT0f69MKW0k,604880,607040,owning the bike for two rally seasons
RT0f69MKW0k,607040,609839,how do i really feel about it
RT0f69MKW0k,609839,610880,well
RT0f69MKW0k,610880,617079,i absolutely unequivocally love it
RT0f69MKW0k,619200,625239,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,625519,628480,it is the best dual sport motorcycle
RT0f69MKW0k,628480,630800,i've ever owned the best i've ever
RT0f69MKW0k,630800,633360,ridden and that's not sarcasm that's not
RT0f69MKW0k,633360,636160,some snarky thing it's the genuine truth
RT0f69MKW0k,636160,636959,i
RT0f69MKW0k,636959,638800,love this motorcycle
RT0f69MKW0k,638800,640079,and for the sake of this very
RT0f69MKW0k,640079,642079,clarkson-esque twist in the review i
RT0f69MKW0k,642079,645040,didn't mention one incredible figure and
RT0f69MKW0k,645040,647440,this makes all literally
RT0f69MKW0k,647440,649519,all of the difference
RT0f69MKW0k,649519,650640,it's the weight
RT0f69MKW0k,650640,658669,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,659120,660959,depending on which article you read or
RT0f69MKW0k,660959,663560,which source you sight the ktm 500 is
RT0f69MKW0k,663560,666000,220 pounds dry
RT0f69MKW0k,666000,668240,for perspective that's about 80 pounds
RT0f69MKW0k,668240,672320,lighter than the 450l or the drz-400
RT0f69MKW0k,672320,676240,it is one pound lighter than my 2017 ktm
RT0f69MKW0k,676240,679360,300 xcw two-stroke
RT0f69MKW0k,679360,682399,how did they do that well finally all
RT0f69MKW0k,682399,685200,the silly ktm weight savings gimmicks
RT0f69MKW0k,685200,688800,like the abysmal kickstand have paid off
RT0f69MKW0k,688800,692399,the motor alone only weighs 65 pounds so
RT0f69MKW0k,692399,695200,this 510 cubic centimeter bike with
RT0f69MKW0k,695200,697839,blinkers a headlight emissions nonsense
RT0f69MKW0k,697839,699279,and six gears
RT0f69MKW0k,699279,702720,is as light as many modern two strokes
RT0f69MKW0k,702720,705120,so yes its horsepower torque suspension
RT0f69MKW0k,705120,707839,travel all are totally average but
RT0f69MKW0k,707839,710720,quickly imagine what lugging a 70 pound
RT0f69MKW0k,710720,712160,bag of sand
RT0f69MKW0k,712160,714000,would do to your handling
RT0f69MKW0k,714000,716160,dumping that 70 pounds means that
RT0f69MKW0k,716160,718240,average horsepower gets you moving
RT0f69MKW0k,718240,720560,quicker it means the brakes stop you
RT0f69MKW0k,720560,722160,faster it means the suspension doesn't
RT0f69MKW0k,722160,724720,have to work as hard to keep the knobs
RT0f69MKW0k,724720,726880,planted in the dirt
RT0f69MKW0k,726880,729120,weight makes an enormous difference and
RT0f69MKW0k,729120,730959,it's not just the handling of the bike
RT0f69MKW0k,730959,732639,which is significant
RT0f69MKW0k,732639,735120,picking it up after a crash pivot turns
RT0f69MKW0k,735120,737200,truck loading even pushing it off
RT0f69MKW0k,737200,738959,yourself or moving it around in the
RT0f69MKW0k,738959,741920,garage even when it's rubber side up are
RT0f69MKW0k,741920,743680,all easily done
RT0f69MKW0k,743680,746079,just for another fun comparison the ktm
RT0f69MKW0k,746079,748560,500 is 10 pounds less
RT0f69MKW0k,748560,750320,than a honda grom
RT0f69MKW0k,750320,751519,and yet
RT0f69MKW0k,751519,753519,it can reach 80 miles per hour
RT0f69MKW0k,753519,756240,relatively smoothly and it's nimble and
RT0f69MKW0k,756240,759120,weirdly planted on the flip side how is
RT0f69MKW0k,759120,761600,it so good in the dirt that i've
RT0f69MKW0k,761600,763839,considered selling my beloved two-stroke
RT0f69MKW0k,763839,767120,300 sparta because the 500 is far more
RT0f69MKW0k,767120,769519,functional as a commuter an adventurer
RT0f69MKW0k,769519,772000,even just a scoot around town bike and
RT0f69MKW0k,772000,774480,yet there's no mixing oil no crappy gas
RT0f69MKW0k,774480,776720,mileage no screaming vibrations and
RT0f69MKW0k,776720,779040,limited two-stroke top speeds
RT0f69MKW0k,779040,781440,all the pros of a great dual sport with
RT0f69MKW0k,781440,783600,the weight and performance albeit not
RT0f69MKW0k,783600,784959,quite the feel
RT0f69MKW0k,784959,787440,of a two-stroke dirt bike
RT0f69MKW0k,787440,789760,so here you have a dual sport that is
RT0f69MKW0k,789760,792399,top-notch on the road with six gears and
RT0f69MKW0k,792399,795040,comfortable highway speeds and also very
RT0f69MKW0k,795040,797920,nearly as capable in the dirt as a 300
RT0f69MKW0k,797920,799040,two-stroke
RT0f69MKW0k,799040,800800,and lighter
RT0f69MKW0k,800800,802959,i seriously just don't get it this is as
RT0f69MKW0k,802959,805680,close to the unicorn dual sport as you
RT0f69MKW0k,805680,806720,can get
RT0f69MKW0k,806720,808959,and i think a lot of that comes down to
RT0f69MKW0k,808959,811040,the motor and i have to say that despite
RT0f69MKW0k,811040,813600,how much i like the bike overall
RT0f69MKW0k,813600,815920,this lightweight motor and transmission
RT0f69MKW0k,815920,818320,do have some quirks that while they're
RT0f69MKW0k,818320,820160,insanely light they make it less than
RT0f69MKW0k,820160,823040,perfect it is not a lazy man's dual
RT0f69MKW0k,823040,826480,sport many dual sports even the 302
RT0f69MKW0k,826480,829120,stroke allow you to ride all day in
RT0f69MKW0k,829120,831760,third gear and still pull like a tractor
RT0f69MKW0k,831760,834560,the 500 will give you an unpleasant
RT0f69MKW0k,834560,837040,rattle buzz when you're not quick with
RT0f69MKW0k,837040,838959,the gear changes and while it lessened
RT0f69MKW0k,838959,841199,after breaking in there's still quite a
RT0f69MKW0k,841199,844000,lot of pretty pronounced vibration
RT0f69MKW0k,844000,847199,but aside from that it is perfect
RT0f69MKW0k,847199,848720,and i know this sounds crazy because
RT0f69MKW0k,848720,851600,it's quite expensive but the ktm 500 is
RT0f69MKW0k,851600,853760,an amazing value for money and here's
RT0f69MKW0k,853760,855040,why
RT0f69MKW0k,855040,857199,most dual sports have to compromise
RT0f69MKW0k,857199,859440,either road or dirt performance
RT0f69MKW0k,859440,861440,stability on the road for adventure
RT0f69MKW0k,861440,863360,riding and the like usually means more
RT0f69MKW0k,863360,865199,weight softer suspension
RT0f69MKW0k,865199,867120,this naturally means poorer performance
RT0f69MKW0k,867120,868320,in the dirt
RT0f69MKW0k,868320,870240,dirt oriented dual sports usually
RT0f69MKW0k,870240,872240,struggle with stiffer suspension lighter
RT0f69MKW0k,872240,874880,weight and just rattle you to death on
RT0f69MKW0k,874880,876079,the road
RT0f69MKW0k,876079,878079,well a few years ago i did a dual sport
RT0f69MKW0k,878079,880320,comparison chart where thousands of
RT0f69MKW0k,880320,882320,survey respondents ranked their dual
RT0f69MKW0k,882320,885440,sports on how well their bikes performed
RT0f69MKW0k,885440,887839,on the road and off road and the best
RT0f69MKW0k,887839,889519,dual sports were the ones that scored
RT0f69MKW0k,889519,892320,highest both on and off road they had a
RT0f69MKW0k,892320,895040,wide range of capability
RT0f69MKW0k,895040,898560,in my opinion the ktm 500 is one of the
RT0f69MKW0k,898560,901519,best road performing dual sports i also
RT0f69MKW0k,901519,903839,think it's right up there with those 302
RT0f69MKW0k,903839,905760,strokes to be incredibly good in the
RT0f69MKW0k,905760,908320,dirt not quite as good but so close that
RT0f69MKW0k,908320,910160,a weekend warrior like myself would
RT0f69MKW0k,910160,912720,hardly notice a difference this bike has
RT0f69MKW0k,912720,915760,the largest range of capability of any
RT0f69MKW0k,915760,917920,dual sport that i have ever ridden now
RT0f69MKW0k,917920,920480,normally i would say oh the ktm is
RT0f69MKW0k,920480,922720,definitely better than say a drz but the
RT0f69MKW0k,922720,924480,difference in its performance aren't
RT0f69MKW0k,924480,926959,worth the extra you know ten thousand
RT0f69MKW0k,926959,929360,dollars i've actually said that in past
RT0f69MKW0k,929360,933040,reviews about the husqvarna and ktm 350s
RT0f69MKW0k,933040,935600,but that would be hypocritical of me to
RT0f69MKW0k,935600,937600,say that now because right now i have a
RT0f69MKW0k,937600,940560,drz-400 heavily modded which has been
RT0f69MKW0k,940560,942399,great for longer adventures while still
RT0f69MKW0k,942399,945279,doing 90 percent of what i want to do
RT0f69MKW0k,945279,948320,off-road but the drz can't do it all
RT0f69MKW0k,948320,950079,they're still that 10
RT0f69MKW0k,950079,951920,and trails in that 10
RT0f69MKW0k,951920,954000,are an absolute blast and i don't want
RT0f69MKW0k,954000,955440,to miss out on those
RT0f69MKW0k,955440,958880,so i bought a ktm 302 stroke to fill in
RT0f69MKW0k,958880,962639,the drz gap and to do those 10 trails
RT0f69MKW0k,962639,963920,7 000
RT0f69MKW0k,963920,966160,plus a few grand and mods for the ktm
RT0f69MKW0k,966160,967519,300
RT0f69MKW0k,967519,970480,000 plus a few grand in mods for the drc
RT0f69MKW0k,970480,973279,400 and then all of a sudden the ktm 500
RT0f69MKW0k,973279,976639,comes along stock suspension stock motor
RT0f69MKW0k,976639,979279,and does all that the drz can do all
RT0f69MKW0k,979279,981920,that the 300 can do for about the same
RT0f69MKW0k,981920,986380,price as both bikes combined
RT0f69MKW0k,986380,989450,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,990950,994229,[Applause]
RT0f69MKW0k,995820,999299,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,1003340,1010110,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,1010110,1015459,[Applause]
RT0f69MKW0k,1018079,1020800,now you see where i'm coming from it may
RT0f69MKW0k,1020800,1023279,only be ten percent better than a drz
RT0f69MKW0k,1023279,1026880,but to fill in that very fun 10 gap i
RT0f69MKW0k,1026880,1030079,had to buy another 7 000 motorcycle
RT0f69MKW0k,1030079,1033120,that's why the 500 is actually an
RT0f69MKW0k,1033120,1035760,incredible value if you need a bike that
RT0f69MKW0k,1035760,1039839,can truly do it all
RT0f69MKW0k,1041310,1052720,[Music]
RT0f69MKW0k,1052720,1055679,but there is a big big
RT0f69MKW0k,1055679,1056799,big
RT0f69MKW0k,1056799,1058880,psychological hang-up
RT0f69MKW0k,1058880,1059679,it's
RT0f69MKW0k,1059679,1062160,a deal killer for me and likely for
RT0f69MKW0k,1062160,1065600,others in a similar financial situation
RT0f69MKW0k,1065600,1068400,while the 500 is quite easily the best
RT0f69MKW0k,1068400,1071360,dual sport ever built i just can't ride
RT0f69MKW0k,1071360,1073760,it like i really really want to
RT0f69MKW0k,1073760,1076480,every scratch every drop every loop out
RT0f69MKW0k,1076480,1078880,or low side or any other dirt bikey
RT0f69MKW0k,1078880,1080400,inevitability
RT0f69MKW0k,1080400,1082320,and forget the physical damage every
RT0f69MKW0k,1082320,1085120,single road mile i put on this bike
RT0f69MKW0k,1085120,1088320,i know it's just bleeding resale and
RT0f69MKW0k,1088320,1090400,while i was joking about halving my
RT0f69MKW0k,1090400,1093039,gentleman's ballast to buy it i wasn't
RT0f69MKW0k,1093039,1095840,kidding about my kids college funds
RT0f69MKW0k,1095840,1097760,fourteen thousand dollars after the
RT0f69MKW0k,1097760,1100400,needed mods was a ton of money and with
RT0f69MKW0k,1100400,1102720,that kind of money spent there's an
RT0f69MKW0k,1102720,1104799,undeniable guilt
RT0f69MKW0k,1104799,1106720,and here's the inevitable ever
RT0f69MKW0k,1106720,1108400,rightiness of this video a
RT0f69MKW0k,1108400,1110400,clarkson-esque twist to my original
RT0f69MKW0k,1110400,1113039,clarkson-esque twist where the cheap
RT0f69MKW0k,1113039,1115520,milk crate bungee cording plastic spray
RT0f69MKW0k,1115520,1117760,painting harbor phrase zip tie abusing
RT0f69MKW0k,1117760,1118799,me
RT0f69MKW0k,1118799,1120640,rears his ugly head
RT0f69MKW0k,1120640,1123120,this bike is incredible it's the best
RT0f69MKW0k,1123120,1125360,thing we dual sporters have got but if
RT0f69MKW0k,1125360,1127840,you're not made of money it's going to
RT0f69MKW0k,1127840,1130960,hurt like a kick to inseam valley every
RT0f69MKW0k,1130960,1133120,time you ride this bike
RT0f69MKW0k,1133120,1136320,a nagging little 2014 evaride will haunt
RT0f69MKW0k,1136320,1138080,the back of your mind and remind you
RT0f69MKW0k,1138080,1140160,that with every mile you are losing
RT0f69MKW0k,1140160,1141120,money
RT0f69MKW0k,1141120,1143360,that you will never get back
RT0f69MKW0k,1143360,1146720,it's a pestering malignant thought tumor
RT0f69MKW0k,1146720,1148880,whispering that you could have had just
RT0f69MKW0k,1148880,1152000,as much fun more perhaps on a bike that
RT0f69MKW0k,1152000,1153840,you could ride without so much as a
RT0f69MKW0k,1153840,1158400,whiff of resale regret the 2022 ktm 500
RT0f69MKW0k,1158400,1160640,is incredibly good it's the closest
RT0f69MKW0k,1160640,1162559,thing we have to dual sport perfection
RT0f69MKW0k,1162559,1164799,right now it is a masterpiece of a
RT0f69MKW0k,1164799,1166640,machine
RT0f69MKW0k,1166640,1168960,but it lacks the absolute psychological
RT0f69MKW0k,1168960,1170960,freedom that one gets from riding a bike
RT0f69MKW0k,1170960,1174160,that has bottomed out in depreciation
RT0f69MKW0k,1174160,1177760,so ktm 500 excf
RT0f69MKW0k,1177760,1179120,six days
RT0f69MKW0k,1179120,1181600,i'm breaking up with you and truly
RT0f69MKW0k,1181600,1184080,honestly it's not you
RT0f69MKW0k,1184080,1186320,it's me
RT0f69MKW0k,1186320,1188320,hey for you guys who are patrons and
RT0f69MKW0k,1188320,1190400,producers thank you so so much for
RT0f69MKW0k,1190400,1192559,making this video and all of my videos
RT0f69MKW0k,1192559,1194480,possible you guys are the lifeblood of
RT0f69MKW0k,1194480,1196320,this channel and i'm so grateful for
RT0f69MKW0k,1196320,1199120,your support it's been a blessing to be
RT0f69MKW0k,1199120,1201200,able to buy bikes like this in large
RT0f69MKW0k,1201200,1203120,part because of those funds
RT0f69MKW0k,1203120,1204799,and to be untethered from any kind of
RT0f69MKW0k,1204799,1207520,sponsorship so i can make these reviews
RT0f69MKW0k,1207520,1209039,brutally honest
RT0f69MKW0k,1209039,1210960,also guys i want to apologize for not
