SK4uLmodN6A,2000,4358,It's AumSum Time.
SK4uLmodN6A,5726,8134,How do Electromagnets Work?
SK4uLmodN6A,8634,9563,Simple.
SK4uLmodN6A,9906,15000,They work because they have a magnetic personality like me.
SK4uLmodN6A,15386,17066,Oh AumSum.
SK4uLmodN6A,17750,22310,To buy AumSum merchandise visit AumSum.com. 
SK4uLmodN6A,23473,26420,The construction of an  electromagnet is very simple. 
SK4uLmodN6A,26875,31044,"A conductive wire, usually made of copper  is wrapped around a piece of metal. "
SK4uLmodN6A,31366,36117,In this case iron. Now with the help  of a battery a current is introduced. 
SK4uLmodN6A,36160,39200,"This current starts flowing  through the coiled wire,  "
SK4uLmodN6A,39350,41809,Resulting in the creation of a magnetic field.
SK4uLmodN6A,42303,45285,This magnetic field magnetizes the iron metal.
SK4uLmodN6A,45920,49120,Thus resulting in the  creation of an electromagnet. 
SK4uLmodN6A,49840,52910,An electromagnet is similar to a magnet.
SK4uLmodN6A,52910,57531,"It has two poles, like poles repel each other while opposites attract."
SK4uLmodN6A,59740,62103,Also it is able to attract iron filings.
SK4uLmodN6A,63947,69200,"The only difference is that the magnetism is not permanent, once the current is removed. "
SK4uLmodN6A,69200,72960,Magnetism may stop working  suddenly or after some time. 
SK4uLmodN6A,74720,79564,An electric bell is a good example  of the use of an electromagnet.
