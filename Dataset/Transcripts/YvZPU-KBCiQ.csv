YvZPU-KBCiQ,100,1930,- I'm paleontologist Hans Sues.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,1930,4640,Today I will be answering your questions from Twitter.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,4640,6457,This is Dino Support.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,6458,9041,[upbeat music]
YvZPU-KBCiQ,11557,15480,"@TokageSetsuna asks, what's the scariest dinosaur?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,15480,17359,I think the scariest looking dinosaur
YvZPU-KBCiQ,17360,19890,"would've been Spinosaurus, simply because it had"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,19890,21590,this huge sail on its back.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,21590,23150,But I think here in the United States
YvZPU-KBCiQ,23150,26050,the T-Rex is definitely the people's favorite.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,26050,27910,Here's part of a T-Rex tooth.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,27910,30130,"The largest tooth, including the root,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,30130,32610,gets up to about seven or eight inches in length.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,32610,35240,"These cutting edges are serrated, like a steak knife."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,35240,37890,T-Rex ate the whole prey.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,37890,40030,"We have fossil droppings of T-Rex,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,40030,43399,and they show us that it ate the meat and the bones.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,43400,45250,"It crunched up the bones, much like"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,45250,47327,some big crocodiles do today.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,47327,50920,"@RickyDelz asks, scientifically and historically speaking,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,50920,53039,how do we know what dinosaurs sounded like?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,53040,55410,Surely the sounds the movies have taught us
YvZPU-KBCiQ,55410,56840,"are just guesses, no?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,56840,58780,"Well, indeed they are just guesses."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,58780,62000,"In fact, it's quite likely that dinosaurs were much quieter"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,62000,63460,than people give them credit for.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,63460,66180,"Birds sing, but most reptiles don't make much"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,66180,69150,"in the way of sounds, except for hisses and grunts."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,69150,72920,"So we think that dinosaurs would have done things like that,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,72920,75200,but certainly not this lion roar
YvZPU-KBCiQ,75200,77132,that Hollywood wants us to believe.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,77133,82133,"Ev4n2k4 asks, when I die and go to heaven,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,82210,83930,first thing I'm asking God is
YvZPU-KBCiQ,83930,86080,what did Jurassic Park get wrong?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,86080,89340,"Jurassic Park was made as an entertaining movie,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,89340,91159,not as a science documentary.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,91160,94140,The star of the movies are the raptors.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,94140,97700,Here is an actual skull of an adult Velociraptor.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,97700,100689,"The filmmakers decided that it looked too puny,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,100690,102180,and they needed something bigger.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,102180,105400,"Strangely enough, shortly after this was filmed,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,105400,108900,people found a really gigantic raptor out in Utah.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,108900,111760,"And since then, other giant raptors have been found"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,111760,113680,in South America and in Asia.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,113680,115420,"So there were giant raptors around,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,115420,116950,"but they were, in fact, much bigger"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,116950,118350,than the ones in the movie.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,118350,120210,The movie claims that T-Rex
YvZPU-KBCiQ,120210,122740,could only detect prey by motion.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,122740,125820,"In fact, when we study the brain case of a T-Rex,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,125820,128830,"we find that it had very large olfactory bulbs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,128830,130250,which are the part of the brain
YvZPU-KBCiQ,130250,132430,that picks up information from the nose.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,132430,135060,"It had a very large opening for the optic nerve,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,135060,137390,which is the nerve that transmits information
YvZPU-KBCiQ,137390,139069,from the eye to the brain.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,139070,141430,And it had a very complicated inner ear
YvZPU-KBCiQ,141430,144170,that allowed it to hear at least the wide range
YvZPU-KBCiQ,144170,145730,of low frequency sounds.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,145730,149640,"So it would've smelled the actors in front of its snout,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,149640,152247,"and it would've been a very short movie, indeed."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,152247,157247,"@emohairawsten, how did the asteroid kill every dinosaur?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,157490,160450,Doesn't an asteroid hit one general area
YvZPU-KBCiQ,160450,162250,rather than the entire world?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,162250,165910,The asteroid theory is a very flat earth theory.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,165910,167190,There's no flat earth.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,167190,169010,The earth is a sphere.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,169010,172500,"What happened was when the asteroid happens to impact,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,172500,175900,"it released the equivalent of 100,000,000"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,175900,177939,mega tons of energy.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,177940,180750,"And this basically melted this huge asteroid,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,180750,182460,which was six miles in diameter.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,182460,185320,And this sent up a gigantic cloud
YvZPU-KBCiQ,185320,188960,of glowing material up into the atmosphere.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,188960,190840,This would spread around the world.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,190840,191813,We see this even today.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,191813,194820,"When a volcano erupts, volcanic dust"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,194820,196410,sweeps all around the world.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,196410,197890,Imagine a world where suddenly
YvZPU-KBCiQ,197890,200950,it's raining drops of molten glass.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,200950,202200,That's what was happening.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,202200,206110,And so basically every larger animal at that point died.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,206110,208550,"And that's why the dinosaurs were wiped out,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,208550,211150,"probably within a matter of hours,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,211150,213377,"at most, a matter of days."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,213377,216170,"@laurenbergerr asks, how do they know"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,216170,217670,what color dinosaurs were?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,217670,219920,"For many years, we really had no idea"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,219920,221370,what color dinosaurs had.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,221370,223629,"In fact, people assumed that like many"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,223630,227160,"of the modern lizards, snakes, crocodiles, turtles,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,227160,228940,"it would've been greenish brown,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,228940,231530,and that's what you see in all of the old dinosaur books.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,231530,234120,"However, in recent years, thanks to some"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,234120,236069,"remarkable discoveries in China,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,236070,239260,"we actually found out what some dinosaurs looked like,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,239260,241170,and it was a real revelation.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,241170,243740,We found that some of the little feathered dinosaurs
YvZPU-KBCiQ,243740,246360,actually had color patterns as vivid
YvZPU-KBCiQ,246360,247793,as those in modern birds.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,247793,250480,"There's a dinosaur called Caihong,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,250480,253430,and it had beautifully iridescent feathers.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,253430,257070,So it would've looked like a big starling with nasty claws.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,257070,260100,So the dinosaur world was far more colorful
YvZPU-KBCiQ,260100,261653,than we were previously thinking.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,261653,266654,"@t6lly asks, so why were dinosaurs so big back then,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,267360,269319,but now animals are small?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,269320,270710,Scientists go.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,270710,272729,"A lot of dinosaurs were big,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,272730,274620,but there were also small dinosaurs.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,274620,275850,"In fact, there's one dinosaur"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,275850,277750,that's barely over two feet long.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,277750,280460,Do you live in an environment where it's advantageous
YvZPU-KBCiQ,280460,283030,to be big for your particular mode of life?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,283030,284070,And there's some places on earth
YvZPU-KBCiQ,284070,285990,where the rules are reversed.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,285990,289699,"Often on islands, generally large animals become dwarfs."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,289700,293020,"About 15,000,000 years ago, a gigantic hedgehog"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,293020,295500,"lived on an island, and what's now Italy."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,295500,297540,"In other parts of the Mediterranean,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,297540,299600,there were tiny elephants running around
YvZPU-KBCiQ,299600,301930,that would've actually been nice little pets
YvZPU-KBCiQ,301930,303820,if we had been around at that time.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,303820,308020,"Godstiddies asks, how many species of dinosaurs are there?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,308020,309360,I want to know all of them.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,309360,311400,"Right now, there are about 1,100"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,311400,314919,"described species of dinosaurs, other than birds."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,314920,316500,Even very conservative estimates
YvZPU-KBCiQ,316500,319090,"put the number much higher, anywhere between"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,319090,322440,"2,000 and 5,000, and there may have been even more."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,322440,324060,One important thing to keep in mind is
YvZPU-KBCiQ,324060,327330,we are much closer in time to a T-Rex
YvZPU-KBCiQ,327330,329419,than the T-Rex was to a Stegosaurus.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,329420,333260,We now have classified this myriad of species
YvZPU-KBCiQ,333260,335800,by looking at various parts of their skeleton.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,335800,339449,The most obvious part of the skeleton is the hip region.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,339450,342210,"When you look at the T-Rex over my shoulder here,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,342210,345690,you can see a hip girdle that has three bones
YvZPU-KBCiQ,345690,349230,"with the front bone, the pubic, pointing downwards,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,349230,351990,"whereas in the so-called bird hipped dinosaurs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,351990,353479,which is unfortunately a misnomer
YvZPU-KBCiQ,353480,355150,"since they have nothing to do with birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,355150,357919,you get a hip region that has
YvZPU-KBCiQ,357920,360550,the pubic bone pointing backwards.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,360550,363250,"There are many more subtle anatomical differences,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,363250,366190,but basically there are two large groups of dinosaurs.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,366190,368950,"The lizard hipped dinosaurs, also called Saurischia,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,368950,372089,"and the bird hipped dinosaurs, called Ornithischia."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,372089,376520,"@lustclouds asks, why did T-Rexes have little arms?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,376520,379389,That does not sit right with me for a dinosaur.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,379390,382840,"T-Rex had really small, but very powerful arms,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,382840,385810,and you can see this here on our pride and joy.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,385810,388880,Nobody really knows why T-Rex has tiny arms.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,388880,390980,It has been calculated that the arms
YvZPU-KBCiQ,390980,394600,were still strong enough to lift up to 600 pounds of weight.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,394600,398220,Earlier relatives of T-Rex still have longer arms.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,398220,400540,Other predatory dinosaurs actually get
YvZPU-KBCiQ,400540,403020,"increasingly longer arms, which eventually"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,403020,404607,become wings in birds.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,404607,409500,"@solarhwngs asks, since when were pterodactyls"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,409500,410560,not dinosaurs?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,410560,411790,Since ever.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,411790,414730,"Dinosaurs and pterodactyls are related,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,414730,417530,but pterodactyls have nothing to do with dinosaurs.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,417530,419750,"They have an early common ancestor,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,419750,423200,but they diverged in their evolution quite dramatically.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,423200,425540,Pterodactyls became flying creatures
YvZPU-KBCiQ,425540,427680,"with wings very different from those of birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,427680,430280,"whereas dinosaurs were mostly land dwelling animals,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,430280,433310,"and only a few forms later on evolved into birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,433310,434837,which have very different looking wings.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,434837,439280,@TrooperSnooks asks the question of the day.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,439280,442240,"Why did the early mammals and birds and fish,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,442240,445139,"like sturgeon, et cetera, not become extinct"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,445140,446350,when the dinosaurs did?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,446350,447390,"That's a very good question, and, in fact,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,447390,450790,it's one of the great mysteries of paleontology.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,450790,453350,It's basically different life strategies.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,453350,455310,Small animals can hide.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,455310,458930,A lot of small animals are also able to go without food
YvZPU-KBCiQ,458930,461810,"for long times, whereas a large animal cannot."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,461810,463480,"Most dinosaurs went extinct,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,463480,466770,"and only one group of dinosaurs, birds, survived."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,466770,469639,"Birds, as I just said, are dinosaurs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,469640,473240,"because they descended from small, meat eating dinosaurs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,473240,476300,"just like we are primates, because we descended"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,476300,478120,from other kinds of primates.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,478120,481150,We now have a beautiful series of fossils
YvZPU-KBCiQ,481150,483740,documenting all of the stages between
YvZPU-KBCiQ,483740,486280,"little predatory dinosaurs like that,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,486280,488780,and birds that would've been recognizable
YvZPU-KBCiQ,488780,490980,as a bird to anyone alive today.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,490980,494080,It's very rare that you get such a nice continuation
YvZPU-KBCiQ,494080,496930,of fossils between one group and a group
YvZPU-KBCiQ,496930,498350,that it gave rise to.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,498351,501430,"@TrieboldPaleo, who would win in a fight?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,501430,503660,Camarasaurus or an Anatotitan?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,503660,505870,An Anatotitan and Camarasaurus lived at
YvZPU-KBCiQ,505870,508040,"very, very different points in time."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,508040,510730,"An Anatotitan at the end of the Cretaceous period,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,510730,513360,"about 66 to 68,000,000 years ago,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,513360,516120,"and Camarasaurus about 150,000,000 years ago."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,516120,518000,"My money would be on the Camarasaurus,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,518000,520900,simply because Camarasaurus got a lot bigger.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,520900,523360,"Both, though, are harmless plant eaters,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,523360,525636,and so I don't think they would've really fought each other.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,525637,529380,"@Harry_Buttcheek asks, what was the climate"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,529380,530840,when the dinosaurs roamed?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,530840,532530,The world in which dinosaurs lived
YvZPU-KBCiQ,532530,534530,"was generally a fairly warm one,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,534530,537470,"however, at high latitudes where the sun would disappear"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,537470,540019,"for months at a time, it would've been quite cold,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,540020,543460,and we actually have even evidence from fossil soils
YvZPU-KBCiQ,543460,545850,"that there were permafrost soils in some areas,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,545850,547310,yet dinosaurs lived there.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,547310,550240,Dinosaurs really could cover almost any environment
YvZPU-KBCiQ,550240,551130,that you can imagine.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,551130,553470,We know dinosaurs that lived essentially
YvZPU-KBCiQ,553470,555519,under sub polar conditions.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,555520,558280,We know dinosaurs that lived in really tropical regions.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,558280,560340,We know dinosaurs that lived in deserts.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,560340,564480,"So basically in a warm period of geological history,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,564480,565337,they were everywhere.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,565337,570337,"@Udonis_Haslem69 asks, how are fossils a thing?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,571110,573920,"Don't those, beep, just disintegrate?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,573920,575709,"Well, fossils are a thing."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,575710,578340,"They're real, three dimensional objects."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,578340,581530,Here's a limb bone of an ostrich mimic dinosaur
YvZPU-KBCiQ,581530,583370,"that's about 90,000,000 years old."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,583370,585300,"Basically what happens is after death,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,585300,587670,minerals infiltrated this bone
YvZPU-KBCiQ,587670,589220,"from the ground water around it,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,589220,591129,"and they contained a lot of iron,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,591130,593200,"that's why it has this yellowish brown color,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,593200,597050,and gradually filled in all of the spaces in the bone.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,597050,599930,"Sometimes the actual bone is still pretty much preserved,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,599930,602350,"but in most cases, the bone has changed"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,602350,605610,"just ever so slightly so that it's no longer possible,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,605610,609047,"for instance, to extract biomolecules like DNA from it."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,609047,613800,"@arc315 asks, were dinosaur feathers dinosaur scale,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,613800,616410,or did they have a lot of bird sized feathers?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,616410,618819,The really gigantic dinosaurs by and large
YvZPU-KBCiQ,618820,619780,did not have feathers.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,619780,623220,We only know one really large Tyrannosaur from China
YvZPU-KBCiQ,623220,626199,that lived in a very cold environment and had feathers.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,626200,629470,Most of the dinosaurs that we know that had feathers
YvZPU-KBCiQ,629470,632920,"were animals up to maybe five or six feet in length,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,632920,635089,and they had bird sized feathers.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,635090,636930,And we know this because the bones
YvZPU-KBCiQ,636930,638980,"have little bumps on them, and you can see them"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,638980,640529,when you take a chicken apart.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,640530,642670,"They're called quill nodes, and that's where the large"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,642670,644427,flight feathers in a bird insert.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,644427,649427,"@mr_soak asks, idea, what was the smartest dinosaur like?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,649640,651340,Would they have used tools?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,651340,652250,Built shelter?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,652250,654530,How much could they understand about the world?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,654530,656583,Some of these little predatory dinosaurs
YvZPU-KBCiQ,656583,658200,have really large brains.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,658200,660200,"They have a bulging area here,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,660200,661960,much like you would see on a bird skull.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,661960,666050,So these little dinosaurs probably had cognitive abilities
YvZPU-KBCiQ,666050,669790,"similar to those that we see today in hawks, owls,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,669790,672190,and particularly in crows and ravens.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,672190,674620,Crows and ravens have repeatedly shown
YvZPU-KBCiQ,674620,678040,their ability to solve relatively complex problems.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,678040,681750,And some birds have minimal kinds of tool use as well.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,681750,684650,And something like that is not beyond the possibility
YvZPU-KBCiQ,684650,686522,for these early dinosaurs as well.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,686522,691129,"@biotchfromhell asks, when did the first humans discover"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,691130,692570,that there were dinosaurs?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,692570,695590,I really want to know how we first figured out
YvZPU-KBCiQ,695590,698750,"giant, giant, giant dinosaurs roamed the earth."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,698750,702370,The first record that we know of a definitive dinosaur
YvZPU-KBCiQ,702370,704807,is from the 17th century in England
YvZPU-KBCiQ,704807,709560,when Robert Plot described a part of a thigh bone.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,709560,711010,He didn't know what to make of it.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,711010,714600,He compared it to giants of legends.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,714600,717970,President Thomas Jefferson couldn't conceive of the fact
YvZPU-KBCiQ,717970,721610,"that animals had gone extinct, even though he found fossils"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,721610,724640,of extinct animals on his estate in Virginia.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,724640,728560,He thought that these animals still existed somewhere
YvZPU-KBCiQ,728560,731020,"alive out West, and that was one of the reasons"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,731020,733300,he sent the Lewis and Clark expeditions out.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,733300,735769,The Smithsonian got into the dinosaur business
YvZPU-KBCiQ,735770,738950,"early in the 20th century, and here's an old photograph."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,738950,740740,This was taken the 1930s.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,740740,742600,"It's an excavation in progress,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,742600,745850,and you see people here chipping out large blocks of rock
YvZPU-KBCiQ,745850,748060,"that have bone in them, and then are taken back"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,748060,751370,to the laboratory where the actual excavation begins.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,751370,754270,"We can glue it back together, clean its surface,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,754270,757177,and ultimately it's ready for study and exhibit.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,757177,759960,"@HalfPassStoned asks, who comes up"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,759960,761860,with these dinosaur names?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,761860,763930,What if a dinosaur were named Hank?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,763930,766600,Why do you gotta make names so complicated?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,766600,768870,The scientists who describe the dinosaurs
YvZPU-KBCiQ,768870,770220,come up with the names.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,770220,773689,Each animal has a genus and a species name.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,773690,776030,"And in the case of dinosaur names, it's the same."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,776030,777880,It's Tyrannosaurus Rex.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,777880,780040,"In that case, it's actually one of the best names"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,780040,782620,"ever chosen for a dinosaur, because the researcher"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,782620,785650,wanted to portray it as the tyrannical creature
YvZPU-KBCiQ,785650,789140,"that ruled its ecosystem, and because of its big size,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,789140,791400,"it was called Rex, which means king."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,791400,793070,I've been very fortunate that somebody
YvZPU-KBCiQ,793070,794660,named a dinosaur for me.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,794660,796810,"There's an animal called Hanssuesia,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,796810,798970,"which is a little boneheaded dinosaur,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,798970,801230,which I take as a backhanded compliment
YvZPU-KBCiQ,802120,803240,that I am boneheaded.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,803240,806016,"But it's a nice thing, because it immortalizes you."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,806017,809700,"@MarkBessen asks, how did T-Rex sleep?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,809700,811790,Curled up roosting like a chicken?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,811790,813120,Asking for a friend.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,813120,816810,"T-Rex presumably crouched, down just like a lot of birds do"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,816810,817850,when they're resting.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,817850,820423,"However, we actually have found dinosaurs"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,820423,823170,that were preserved in burrows where they presumably
YvZPU-KBCiQ,823170,825136,"were sleeping, or at least hanging out."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,825137,827477,And some of them are kind of curled up.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,827477,831529,"@PaulGarciaNBA asks, how did the Brontosaurus"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,831530,834700,weigh 23 tons when it only ate plants?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,834700,836290,You have to imagine that these dinosaurs
YvZPU-KBCiQ,836290,839329,probably spent every waking minute eating.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,839330,841790,The other reason that Brontosaurus is so big is
YvZPU-KBCiQ,841790,844199,"if you eat plants, you have a big problem."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,844200,847380,Much of the plant food that animals and people eat
YvZPU-KBCiQ,847380,849000,is made out of cellulose.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,849000,852560,And so you need a very large gut to accommodate bacteria
YvZPU-KBCiQ,852560,855240,and other microorganisms that can break
YvZPU-KBCiQ,855240,858720,"the cellulose down into fatty acids and in sugars,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,858720,862009,"like glucose, that the host animal can actually digest."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,862010,865080,"So in order to be a full-time plant eater,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,865080,866607,you need a really large gut.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,866607,869910,"@alanilagan asks, were dinosaurs cold blooded"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,869910,871000,or warm blooded?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,871000,872800,I genuinely have no clue.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,872800,874959,"Well, this has been a matter of scientific debate"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,874960,876880,"for many years, but we now think"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,876880,878970,that dinosaurs have a mixture
YvZPU-KBCiQ,878970,880990,of body temperature strategies.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,880990,883970,"The little feathered dinosaurs were warm blooded,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,883970,885699,"much like the descendants of birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,885700,888260,but some of the really large dinosaurs actually
YvZPU-KBCiQ,888260,890570,"were either warm blooded or cold blooded,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,890570,893210,because when you have a really large body mass
YvZPU-KBCiQ,893210,894830,"and live in a warm climate,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,894830,896337,it doesn't really matter either way.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,896337,901337,"@R3ik0_X asks, how long did the dinosaurs live for?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,902510,905200,"Weren't they around for 1,000,000 years or something?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,905200,907710,"Well, dinosaurs as a group first showed up"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,907710,909390,"230,000,000 years ago."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,909390,912610,"Most dinosaurs went extinct 66,000,000 years ago,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,912610,914410,"and of course the descendants of birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,914410,916199,"who are also technically dinosaurs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,916200,917530,exist to the present day.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,917530,920660,We don't know much about individual dinosaurs life span.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,920660,923810,"In the case of the T-Rex, we have found now"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,923810,926380,that the oldest known and largest T-Rex
YvZPU-KBCiQ,926380,929630,was only about 30 years old when it died.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,929630,932700,These dinosaurs grew apparently at an amazing pace
YvZPU-KBCiQ,932700,936810,"early on, and died young and left, in some cases,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,936810,938000,a good looking corpse.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,938000,940150,So those are all the questions for today.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,940150,942010,"I really enjoyed seeing all of them,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,942010,945440,and seeing the level of interest in dinosaurs out there.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,945440,947523,Thank you for watching Dinosaur Support.

YvZPU-KBCiQ,100,1930,- I'm paleontologist Hans Sues.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,1930,4640,Today I will be answering your questions from Twitter.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,4640,6457,This is Dino Support.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,6458,9041,[upbeat music]
YvZPU-KBCiQ,11557,15480,"@TokageSetsuna asks, what's the scariest dinosaur?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,15480,17359,I think the scariest looking dinosaur
YvZPU-KBCiQ,17360,19890,"would've been Spinosaurus, simply because it had"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,19890,21590,this huge sail on its back.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,21590,23150,But I think here in the United States
YvZPU-KBCiQ,23150,26050,the T-Rex is definitely the people's favorite.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,26050,27910,Here's part of a T-Rex tooth.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,27910,30130,"The largest tooth, including the root,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,30130,32610,gets up to about seven or eight inches in length.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,32610,35240,"These cutting edges are serrated, like a steak knife."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,35240,37890,T-Rex ate the whole prey.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,37890,40030,"We have fossil droppings of T-Rex,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,40030,43399,and they show us that it ate the meat and the bones.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,43400,45250,"It crunched up the bones, much like"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,45250,47327,some big crocodiles do today.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,47327,50920,"@RickyDelz asks, scientifically and historically speaking,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,50920,53039,how do we know what dinosaurs sounded like?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,53040,55410,Surely the sounds the movies have taught us
YvZPU-KBCiQ,55410,56840,"are just guesses, no?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,56840,58780,"Well, indeed they are just guesses."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,58780,62000,"In fact, it's quite likely that dinosaurs were much quieter"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,62000,63460,than people give them credit for.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,63460,66180,"Birds sing, but most reptiles don't make much"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,66180,69150,"in the way of sounds, except for hisses and grunts."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,69150,72920,"So we think that dinosaurs would have done things like that,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,72920,75200,but certainly not this lion roar
YvZPU-KBCiQ,75200,77132,that Hollywood wants us to believe.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,77133,82133,"Ev4n2k4 asks, when I die and go to heaven,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,82210,83930,first thing I'm asking God is
YvZPU-KBCiQ,83930,86080,what did Jurassic Park get wrong?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,86080,89340,"Jurassic Park was made as an entertaining movie,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,89340,91159,not as a science documentary.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,91160,94140,The star of the movies are the raptors.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,94140,97700,Here is an actual skull of an adult Velociraptor.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,97700,100689,"The filmmakers decided that it looked too puny,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,100690,102180,and they needed something bigger.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,102180,105400,"Strangely enough, shortly after this was filmed,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,105400,108900,people found a really gigantic raptor out in Utah.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,108900,111760,"And since then, other giant raptors have been found"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,111760,113680,in South America and in Asia.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,113680,115420,"So there were giant raptors around,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,115420,116950,"but they were, in fact, much bigger"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,116950,118350,than the ones in the movie.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,118350,120210,The movie claims that T-Rex
YvZPU-KBCiQ,120210,122740,could only detect prey by motion.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,122740,125820,"In fact, when we study the brain case of a T-Rex,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,125820,128830,"we find that it had very large olfactory bulbs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,128830,130250,which are the part of the brain
YvZPU-KBCiQ,130250,132430,that picks up information from the nose.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,132430,135060,"It had a very large opening for the optic nerve,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,135060,137390,which is the nerve that transmits information
YvZPU-KBCiQ,137390,139069,from the eye to the brain.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,139070,141430,And it had a very complicated inner ear
YvZPU-KBCiQ,141430,144170,that allowed it to hear at least the wide range
YvZPU-KBCiQ,144170,145730,of low frequency sounds.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,145730,149640,"So it would've smelled the actors in front of its snout,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,149640,152247,"and it would've been a very short movie, indeed."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,152247,157247,"@emohairawsten, how did the asteroid kill every dinosaur?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,157490,160450,Doesn't an asteroid hit one general area
YvZPU-KBCiQ,160450,162250,rather than the entire world?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,162250,165910,The asteroid theory is a very flat earth theory.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,165910,167190,There's no flat earth.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,167190,169010,The earth is a sphere.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,169010,172500,"What happened was when the asteroid happens to impact,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,172500,175900,"it released the equivalent of 100,000,000"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,175900,177939,mega tons of energy.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,177940,180750,"And this basically melted this huge asteroid,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,180750,182460,which was six miles in diameter.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,182460,185320,And this sent up a gigantic cloud
YvZPU-KBCiQ,185320,188960,of glowing material up into the atmosphere.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,188960,190840,This would spread around the world.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,190840,191813,We see this even today.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,191813,194820,"When a volcano erupts, volcanic dust"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,194820,196410,sweeps all around the world.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,196410,197890,Imagine a world where suddenly
YvZPU-KBCiQ,197890,200950,it's raining drops of molten glass.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,200950,202200,That's what was happening.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,202200,206110,And so basically every larger animal at that point died.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,206110,208550,"And that's why the dinosaurs were wiped out,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,208550,211150,"probably within a matter of hours,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,211150,213377,"at most, a matter of days."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,213377,216170,"@laurenbergerr asks, how do they know"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,216170,217670,what color dinosaurs were?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,217670,219920,"For many years, we really had no idea"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,219920,221370,what color dinosaurs had.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,221370,223629,"In fact, people assumed that like many"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,223630,227160,"of the modern lizards, snakes, crocodiles, turtles,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,227160,228940,"it would've been greenish brown,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,228940,231530,and that's what you see in all of the old dinosaur books.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,231530,234120,"However, in recent years, thanks to some"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,234120,236069,"remarkable discoveries in China,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,236070,239260,"we actually found out what some dinosaurs looked like,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,239260,241170,and it was a real revelation.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,241170,243740,We found that some of the little feathered dinosaurs
YvZPU-KBCiQ,243740,246360,actually had color patterns as vivid
YvZPU-KBCiQ,246360,247793,as those in modern birds.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,247793,250480,"There's a dinosaur called Caihong,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,250480,253430,and it had beautifully iridescent feathers.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,253430,257070,So it would've looked like a big starling with nasty claws.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,257070,260100,So the dinosaur world was far more colorful
YvZPU-KBCiQ,260100,261653,than we were previously thinking.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,261653,266654,"@t6lly asks, so why were dinosaurs so big back then,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,267360,269319,but now animals are small?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,269320,270710,Scientists go.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,270710,272729,"A lot of dinosaurs were big,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,272730,274620,but there were also small dinosaurs.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,274620,275850,"In fact, there's one dinosaur"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,275850,277750,that's barely over two feet long.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,277750,280460,Do you live in an environment where it's advantageous
YvZPU-KBCiQ,280460,283030,to be big for your particular mode of life?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,283030,284070,And there's some places on earth
YvZPU-KBCiQ,284070,285990,where the rules are reversed.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,285990,289699,"Often on islands, generally large animals become dwarfs."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,289700,293020,"About 15,000,000 years ago, a gigantic hedgehog"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,293020,295500,"lived on an island, and what's now Italy."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,295500,297540,"In other parts of the Mediterranean,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,297540,299600,there were tiny elephants running around
YvZPU-KBCiQ,299600,301930,that would've actually been nice little pets
YvZPU-KBCiQ,301930,303820,if we had been around at that time.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,303820,308020,"Godstiddies asks, how many species of dinosaurs are there?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,308020,309360,I want to know all of them.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,309360,311400,"Right now, there are about 1,100"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,311400,314919,"described species of dinosaurs, other than birds."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,314920,316500,Even very conservative estimates
YvZPU-KBCiQ,316500,319090,"put the number much higher, anywhere between"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,319090,322440,"2,000 and 5,000, and there may have been even more."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,322440,324060,One important thing to keep in mind is
YvZPU-KBCiQ,324060,327330,we are much closer in time to a T-Rex
YvZPU-KBCiQ,327330,329419,than the T-Rex was to a Stegosaurus.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,329420,333260,We now have classified this myriad of species
YvZPU-KBCiQ,333260,335800,by looking at various parts of their skeleton.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,335800,339449,The most obvious part of the skeleton is the hip region.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,339450,342210,"When you look at the T-Rex over my shoulder here,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,342210,345690,you can see a hip girdle that has three bones
YvZPU-KBCiQ,345690,349230,"with the front bone, the pubic, pointing downwards,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,349230,351990,"whereas in the so-called bird hipped dinosaurs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,351990,353479,which is unfortunately a misnomer
YvZPU-KBCiQ,353480,355150,"since they have nothing to do with birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,355150,357919,you get a hip region that has
YvZPU-KBCiQ,357920,360550,the pubic bone pointing backwards.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,360550,363250,"There are many more subtle anatomical differences,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,363250,366190,but basically there are two large groups of dinosaurs.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,366190,368950,"The lizard hipped dinosaurs, also called Saurischia,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,368950,372089,"and the bird hipped dinosaurs, called Ornithischia."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,372089,376520,"@lustclouds asks, why did T-Rexes have little arms?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,376520,379389,That does not sit right with me for a dinosaur.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,379390,382840,"T-Rex had really small, but very powerful arms,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,382840,385810,and you can see this here on our pride and joy.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,385810,388880,Nobody really knows why T-Rex has tiny arms.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,388880,390980,It has been calculated that the arms
YvZPU-KBCiQ,390980,394600,were still strong enough to lift up to 600 pounds of weight.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,394600,398220,Earlier relatives of T-Rex still have longer arms.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,398220,400540,Other predatory dinosaurs actually get
YvZPU-KBCiQ,400540,403020,"increasingly longer arms, which eventually"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,403020,404607,become wings in birds.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,404607,409500,"@solarhwngs asks, since when were pterodactyls"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,409500,410560,not dinosaurs?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,410560,411790,Since ever.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,411790,414730,"Dinosaurs and pterodactyls are related,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,414730,417530,but pterodactyls have nothing to do with dinosaurs.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,417530,419750,"They have an early common ancestor,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,419750,423200,but they diverged in their evolution quite dramatically.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,423200,425540,Pterodactyls became flying creatures
YvZPU-KBCiQ,425540,427680,"with wings very different from those of birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,427680,430280,"whereas dinosaurs were mostly land dwelling animals,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,430280,433310,"and only a few forms later on evolved into birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,433310,434837,which have very different looking wings.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,434837,439280,@TrooperSnooks asks the question of the day.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,439280,442240,"Why did the early mammals and birds and fish,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,442240,445139,"like sturgeon, et cetera, not become extinct"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,445140,446350,when the dinosaurs did?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,446350,447390,"That's a very good question, and, in fact,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,447390,450790,it's one of the great mysteries of paleontology.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,450790,453350,It's basically different life strategies.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,453350,455310,Small animals can hide.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,455310,458930,A lot of small animals are also able to go without food
YvZPU-KBCiQ,458930,461810,"for long times, whereas a large animal cannot."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,461810,463480,"Most dinosaurs went extinct,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,463480,466770,"and only one group of dinosaurs, birds, survived."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,466770,469639,"Birds, as I just said, are dinosaurs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,469640,473240,"because they descended from small, meat eating dinosaurs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,473240,476300,"just like we are primates, because we descended"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,476300,478120,from other kinds of primates.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,478120,481150,We now have a beautiful series of fossils
YvZPU-KBCiQ,481150,483740,documenting all of the stages between
YvZPU-KBCiQ,483740,486280,"little predatory dinosaurs like that,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,486280,488780,and birds that would've been recognizable
YvZPU-KBCiQ,488780,490980,as a bird to anyone alive today.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,490980,494080,It's very rare that you get such a nice continuation
YvZPU-KBCiQ,494080,496930,of fossils between one group and a group
YvZPU-KBCiQ,496930,498350,that it gave rise to.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,498351,501430,"@TrieboldPaleo, who would win in a fight?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,501430,503660,Camarasaurus or an Anatotitan?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,503660,505870,An Anatotitan and Camarasaurus lived at
YvZPU-KBCiQ,505870,508040,"very, very different points in time."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,508040,510730,"An Anatotitan at the end of the Cretaceous period,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,510730,513360,"about 66 to 68,000,000 years ago,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,513360,516120,"and Camarasaurus about 150,000,000 years ago."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,516120,518000,"My money would be on the Camarasaurus,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,518000,520900,simply because Camarasaurus got a lot bigger.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,520900,523360,"Both, though, are harmless plant eaters,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,523360,525636,and so I don't think they would've really fought each other.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,525637,529380,"@Harry_Buttcheek asks, what was the climate"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,529380,530840,when the dinosaurs roamed?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,530840,532530,The world in which dinosaurs lived
YvZPU-KBCiQ,532530,534530,"was generally a fairly warm one,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,534530,537470,"however, at high latitudes where the sun would disappear"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,537470,540019,"for months at a time, it would've been quite cold,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,540020,543460,and we actually have even evidence from fossil soils
YvZPU-KBCiQ,543460,545850,"that there were permafrost soils in some areas,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,545850,547310,yet dinosaurs lived there.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,547310,550240,Dinosaurs really could cover almost any environment
YvZPU-KBCiQ,550240,551130,that you can imagine.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,551130,553470,We know dinosaurs that lived essentially
YvZPU-KBCiQ,553470,555519,under sub polar conditions.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,555520,558280,We know dinosaurs that lived in really tropical regions.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,558280,560340,We know dinosaurs that lived in deserts.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,560340,564480,"So basically in a warm period of geological history,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,564480,565337,they were everywhere.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,565337,570337,"@Udonis_Haslem69 asks, how are fossils a thing?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,571110,573920,"Don't those, beep, just disintegrate?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,573920,575709,"Well, fossils are a thing."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,575710,578340,"They're real, three dimensional objects."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,578340,581530,Here's a limb bone of an ostrich mimic dinosaur
YvZPU-KBCiQ,581530,583370,"that's about 90,000,000 years old."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,583370,585300,"Basically what happens is after death,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,585300,587670,minerals infiltrated this bone
YvZPU-KBCiQ,587670,589220,"from the ground water around it,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,589220,591129,"and they contained a lot of iron,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,591130,593200,"that's why it has this yellowish brown color,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,593200,597050,and gradually filled in all of the spaces in the bone.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,597050,599930,"Sometimes the actual bone is still pretty much preserved,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,599930,602350,"but in most cases, the bone has changed"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,602350,605610,"just ever so slightly so that it's no longer possible,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,605610,609047,"for instance, to extract biomolecules like DNA from it."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,609047,613800,"@arc315 asks, were dinosaur feathers dinosaur scale,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,613800,616410,or did they have a lot of bird sized feathers?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,616410,618819,The really gigantic dinosaurs by and large
YvZPU-KBCiQ,618820,619780,did not have feathers.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,619780,623220,We only know one really large Tyrannosaur from China
YvZPU-KBCiQ,623220,626199,that lived in a very cold environment and had feathers.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,626200,629470,Most of the dinosaurs that we know that had feathers
YvZPU-KBCiQ,629470,632920,"were animals up to maybe five or six feet in length,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,632920,635089,and they had bird sized feathers.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,635090,636930,And we know this because the bones
YvZPU-KBCiQ,636930,638980,"have little bumps on them, and you can see them"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,638980,640529,when you take a chicken apart.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,640530,642670,"They're called quill nodes, and that's where the large"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,642670,644427,flight feathers in a bird insert.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,644427,649427,"@mr_soak asks, idea, what was the smartest dinosaur like?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,649640,651340,Would they have used tools?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,651340,652250,Built shelter?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,652250,654530,How much could they understand about the world?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,654530,656583,Some of these little predatory dinosaurs
YvZPU-KBCiQ,656583,658200,have really large brains.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,658200,660200,"They have a bulging area here,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,660200,661960,much like you would see on a bird skull.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,661960,666050,So these little dinosaurs probably had cognitive abilities
YvZPU-KBCiQ,666050,669790,"similar to those that we see today in hawks, owls,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,669790,672190,and particularly in crows and ravens.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,672190,674620,Crows and ravens have repeatedly shown
YvZPU-KBCiQ,674620,678040,their ability to solve relatively complex problems.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,678040,681750,And some birds have minimal kinds of tool use as well.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,681750,684650,And something like that is not beyond the possibility
YvZPU-KBCiQ,684650,686522,for these early dinosaurs as well.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,686522,691129,"@biotchfromhell asks, when did the first humans discover"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,691130,692570,that there were dinosaurs?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,692570,695590,I really want to know how we first figured out
YvZPU-KBCiQ,695590,698750,"giant, giant, giant dinosaurs roamed the earth."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,698750,702370,The first record that we know of a definitive dinosaur
YvZPU-KBCiQ,702370,704807,is from the 17th century in England
YvZPU-KBCiQ,704807,709560,when Robert Plot described a part of a thigh bone.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,709560,711010,He didn't know what to make of it.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,711010,714600,He compared it to giants of legends.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,714600,717970,President Thomas Jefferson couldn't conceive of the fact
YvZPU-KBCiQ,717970,721610,"that animals had gone extinct, even though he found fossils"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,721610,724640,of extinct animals on his estate in Virginia.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,724640,728560,He thought that these animals still existed somewhere
YvZPU-KBCiQ,728560,731020,"alive out West, and that was one of the reasons"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,731020,733300,he sent the Lewis and Clark expeditions out.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,733300,735769,The Smithsonian got into the dinosaur business
YvZPU-KBCiQ,735770,738950,"early in the 20th century, and here's an old photograph."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,738950,740740,This was taken the 1930s.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,740740,742600,"It's an excavation in progress,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,742600,745850,and you see people here chipping out large blocks of rock
YvZPU-KBCiQ,745850,748060,"that have bone in them, and then are taken back"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,748060,751370,to the laboratory where the actual excavation begins.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,751370,754270,"We can glue it back together, clean its surface,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,754270,757177,and ultimately it's ready for study and exhibit.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,757177,759960,"@HalfPassStoned asks, who comes up"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,759960,761860,with these dinosaur names?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,761860,763930,What if a dinosaur were named Hank?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,763930,766600,Why do you gotta make names so complicated?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,766600,768870,The scientists who describe the dinosaurs
YvZPU-KBCiQ,768870,770220,come up with the names.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,770220,773689,Each animal has a genus and a species name.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,773690,776030,"And in the case of dinosaur names, it's the same."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,776030,777880,It's Tyrannosaurus Rex.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,777880,780040,"In that case, it's actually one of the best names"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,780040,782620,"ever chosen for a dinosaur, because the researcher"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,782620,785650,wanted to portray it as the tyrannical creature
YvZPU-KBCiQ,785650,789140,"that ruled its ecosystem, and because of its big size,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,789140,791400,"it was called Rex, which means king."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,791400,793070,I've been very fortunate that somebody
YvZPU-KBCiQ,793070,794660,named a dinosaur for me.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,794660,796810,"There's an animal called Hanssuesia,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,796810,798970,"which is a little boneheaded dinosaur,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,798970,801230,which I take as a backhanded compliment
YvZPU-KBCiQ,802120,803240,that I am boneheaded.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,803240,806016,"But it's a nice thing, because it immortalizes you."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,806017,809700,"@MarkBessen asks, how did T-Rex sleep?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,809700,811790,Curled up roosting like a chicken?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,811790,813120,Asking for a friend.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,813120,816810,"T-Rex presumably crouched, down just like a lot of birds do"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,816810,817850,when they're resting.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,817850,820423,"However, we actually have found dinosaurs"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,820423,823170,that were preserved in burrows where they presumably
YvZPU-KBCiQ,823170,825136,"were sleeping, or at least hanging out."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,825137,827477,And some of them are kind of curled up.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,827477,831529,"@PaulGarciaNBA asks, how did the Brontosaurus"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,831530,834700,weigh 23 tons when it only ate plants?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,834700,836290,You have to imagine that these dinosaurs
YvZPU-KBCiQ,836290,839329,probably spent every waking minute eating.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,839330,841790,The other reason that Brontosaurus is so big is
YvZPU-KBCiQ,841790,844199,"if you eat plants, you have a big problem."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,844200,847380,Much of the plant food that animals and people eat
YvZPU-KBCiQ,847380,849000,is made out of cellulose.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,849000,852560,And so you need a very large gut to accommodate bacteria
YvZPU-KBCiQ,852560,855240,and other microorganisms that can break
YvZPU-KBCiQ,855240,858720,"the cellulose down into fatty acids and in sugars,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,858720,862009,"like glucose, that the host animal can actually digest."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,862010,865080,"So in order to be a full-time plant eater,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,865080,866607,you need a really large gut.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,866607,869910,"@alanilagan asks, were dinosaurs cold blooded"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,869910,871000,or warm blooded?
YvZPU-KBCiQ,871000,872800,I genuinely have no clue.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,872800,874959,"Well, this has been a matter of scientific debate"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,874960,876880,"for many years, but we now think"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,876880,878970,that dinosaurs have a mixture
YvZPU-KBCiQ,878970,880990,of body temperature strategies.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,880990,883970,"The little feathered dinosaurs were warm blooded,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,883970,885699,"much like the descendants of birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,885700,888260,but some of the really large dinosaurs actually
YvZPU-KBCiQ,888260,890570,"were either warm blooded or cold blooded,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,890570,893210,because when you have a really large body mass
YvZPU-KBCiQ,893210,894830,"and live in a warm climate,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,894830,896337,it doesn't really matter either way.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,896337,901337,"@R3ik0_X asks, how long did the dinosaurs live for?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,902510,905200,"Weren't they around for 1,000,000 years or something?"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,905200,907710,"Well, dinosaurs as a group first showed up"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,907710,909390,"230,000,000 years ago."
YvZPU-KBCiQ,909390,912610,"Most dinosaurs went extinct 66,000,000 years ago,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,912610,914410,"and of course the descendants of birds,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,914410,916199,"who are also technically dinosaurs,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,916200,917530,exist to the present day.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,917530,920660,We don't know much about individual dinosaurs life span.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,920660,923810,"In the case of the T-Rex, we have found now"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,923810,926380,that the oldest known and largest T-Rex
YvZPU-KBCiQ,926380,929630,was only about 30 years old when it died.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,929630,932700,These dinosaurs grew apparently at an amazing pace
YvZPU-KBCiQ,932700,936810,"early on, and died young and left, in some cases,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,936810,938000,a good looking corpse.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,938000,940150,So those are all the questions for today.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,940150,942010,"I really enjoyed seeing all of them,"
YvZPU-KBCiQ,942010,945440,and seeing the level of interest in dinosaurs out there.
YvZPU-KBCiQ,945440,947523,Thank you for watching Dinosaur Support.
