ocZPw3rVYUU,124960,127360,global infrastructure and investment
ocZPw3rVYUU,127360,128479,initiative
ocZPw3rVYUU,128479,130800,this is a project that is in particular
ocZPw3rVYUU,130800,133599,very important for the us president joe
ocZPw3rVYUU,133599,136000,biden because it was the u.s
ocZPw3rVYUU,136000,138640,that had this initiative and it was for
ocZPw3rVYUU,138640,141120,the very first time launched during the
ocZPw3rVYUU,141120,144640,last g7 meeting in cornwall when the
ocZPw3rVYUU,144640,146560,leaders for the very first
ocZPw3rVYUU,146560,149280,time and we were there to report on that
ocZPw3rVYUU,149280,154400,decided to introduce this plan to help
ocZPw3rVYUU,154400,157200,developing countries invest more in
ocZPw3rVYUU,157200,159040,infrastructure
ocZPw3rVYUU,159040,161200,and this plan is meant to be an
ocZPw3rVYUU,161200,164000,alternative to china's belt and road
ocZPw3rVYUU,164000,166560,initiative the multi-trillion
ocZPw3rVYUU,166560,168879,dollars program
ocZPw3rVYUU,168879,170879,that critics say
ocZPw3rVYUU,170879,173599,has the only goal to advance china's
ocZPw3rVYUU,173599,177120,influence so the g7 leaders are saying
ocZPw3rVYUU,177120,178879,we would like to establish an
ocZPw3rVYUU,178879,181120,alternative to this program because
ocZPw3rVYUU,181120,183280,there will be no strings attached we
ocZPw3rVYUU,183280,184879,want to
ocZPw3rVYUU,184879,187360,to help advance democracies in
ocZPw3rVYUU,187360,190239,developing countries we also want them
ocZPw3rVYUU,190239,192159,to invest not only in global
ocZPw3rVYUU,192159,194560,infrastructure but also in digital
ocZPw3rVYUU,194560,196720,infrastructure and in health
ocZPw3rVYUU,196720,199120,infrastructure
ocZPw3rVYUU,199120,203120,and now this is day one of the g7 summit
ocZPw3rVYUU,203120,205360,thomas um they've been speaking for the
ocZPw3rVYUU,205360,208000,last several hours do you know what
ocZPw3rVYUU,208000,210400,they've discussed so far well as of now
ocZPw3rVYUU,210400,212480,it's been more about the symbolism of
ocZPw3rVYUU,212480,214959,this meeting about the leaders showing
ocZPw3rVYUU,214959,217200,that they have a united front when it
ocZPw3rVYUU,217200,218159,comes
ocZPw3rVYUU,218159,220640,to supporting ukraine or to
ocZPw3rVYUU,220640,223440,rejecting russia's actions in ukraine we
ocZPw3rVYUU,223440,226720,saw that very clearly in that inaugural
ocZPw3rVYUU,226720,229440,bilateral meeting between the president
ocZPw3rVYUU,229440,231360,of the united states and the chancellor
ocZPw3rVYUU,231360,233680,of germany stressing openly before the
ocZPw3rVYUU,233680,235840,press but also from what we've heard
ocZPw3rVYUU,235840,237360,from officials that that the
ocZPw3rVYUU,237360,239439,relationship is very strong bilateral
ocZPw3rVYUU,239439,241439,relationship is indeed in a good moment
ocZPw3rVYUU,241439,243040,in a good shape
ocZPw3rVYUU,243040,245280,they haven't i don't think gone into
ocZPw3rVYUU,245280,248159,great detail when it comes to to what
ocZPw3rVYUU,248159,249519,exactly is going to be agreed on that's
ocZPw3rVYUU,249519,250799,something that's probably in the hands
ocZPw3rVYUU,250799,253120,of the negotiators also called sherpas
ocZPw3rVYUU,253120,255200,in fact we heard from from white house
ocZPw3rVYUU,255200,256479,officials that
ocZPw3rVYUU,256479,260000,both leaders didn't discuss extensively
ocZPw3rVYUU,260000,262240,one of the key proposals that's on the
ocZPw3rVYUU,262240,263759,table when it comes to the war in
ocZPw3rVYUU,263759,266320,ukraine and that is putting a price cap
ocZPw3rVYUU,266320,267280,on
ocZPw3rVYUU,267280,269280,on russian oil that's something that
ocZPw3rVYUU,269280,271040,we'll probably hear more in the next few
ocZPw3rVYUU,271040,273919,days but basically this initial day was
ocZPw3rVYUU,273919,276000,about the family photo the arrivals the
ocZPw3rVYUU,276000,278160,symbolism of it all and one of the
ocZPw3rVYUU,278160,280720,concrete measures proposals that we will
ocZPw3rVYUU,280720,282479,hear is what alexandra mentioned just
ocZPw3rVYUU,282479,284160,now about infrastructure it was as
ocZPw3rVYUU,284160,286400,alexander pointed out a very important
ocZPw3rVYUU,286400,289520,element of last year's g7 in in cornwall
ocZPw3rVYUU,289520,291280,it was part of the final communique
ocZPw3rVYUU,291280,292639,there was also a lot of information
ocZPw3rVYUU,292639,294639,coming from the us afterwards a big fact
ocZPw3rVYUU,294639,297919,sheet on what this means and it is very
ocZPw3rVYUU,297919,300160,probable that it will also be part of
ocZPw3rVYUU,300160,301919,the final document that we hear this
ocZPw3rVYUU,301919,304400,time how that project has evolved and
ocZPw3rVYUU,304400,307120,how the g7 can help developing countries
ocZPw3rVYUU,307120,309360,when it comes to infrastructure
ocZPw3rVYUU,309360,311919,well the host of this year's g7 is of
ocZPw3rVYUU,311919,313520,course the german chancellor olaf
ocZPw3rVYUU,313520,316320,schultz and alexandra we know that
ocZPw3rVYUU,316320,318800,germany and in particular the chancellor
ocZPw3rVYUU,318800,321680,has been criticized quite a bit both
ocZPw3rVYUU,321680,324639,abroad and within germany for not doing
ocZPw3rVYUU,324639,327280,enough to support ukraine and yet we
ocZPw3rVYUU,327280,329600,heard earlier today the u.s president
ocZPw3rVYUU,329600,332880,biden calling germany one of the fastest
ocZPw3rVYUU,332880,335680,and closest allies in the world
ocZPw3rVYUU,335680,339840,what do you make of this comment
ocZPw3rVYUU,340960,343520,well we heard from u.s officials that
ocZPw3rVYUU,343520,346080,this meeting was very friendly and very
ocZPw3rVYUU,346080,348720,warm and they're stressed that you asked
ocZPw3rVYUU,348720,351360,president joe biden praised
ocZPw3rVYUU,351360,352720,mr schultz's
ocZPw3rVYUU,352720,356160,leadership but also expressed his trust
ocZPw3rVYUU,356160,358319,in the german chancellor and they also
ocZPw3rVYUU,358319,360800,stressed that there was a broad
ocZPw3rVYUU,360800,364000,alignment on all of the issues discussed
ocZPw3rVYUU,364000,366000,and of course it's true that germany is
ocZPw3rVYUU,366000,369520,one of the closest uh eu as partners
ocZPw3rVYUU,369520,370800,allies
ocZPw3rVYUU,370800,373199,but it is also true that germany as you
ocZPw3rVYUU,373199,375759,said has been facing a lot of criticism
ocZPw3rVYUU,375759,377840,for not doing enough to help ukraine for
ocZPw3rVYUU,377840,379840,not providing lethal weapons that is
ocZPw3rVYUU,379840,382560,something that is happening now but even
ocZPw3rVYUU,382560,383520,when
ocZPw3rVYUU,383520,385039,the german chancellor olaf schultz
ocZPw3rVYUU,385039,387360,announced this about faith
ocZPw3rVYUU,387360,389680,with regard to germany's foreign and
ocZPw3rVYUU,389680,392160,defense policies many
ocZPw3rVYUU,392160,395360,critics said that he was not determined
ocZPw3rVYUU,395360,397680,enough that he was still has a
ocZPw3rVYUU,397680,401520,hesitant so um this this very uh
ocZPw3rVYUU,401520,404080,friendly and warm exchange was also
ocZPw3rVYUU,404080,406400,showing uh between the two leaders the
ocZPw3rVYUU,406400,408479,u.s president and german chancellor was
ocZPw3rVYUU,408479,410960,also showing how important it is for the
ocZPw3rVYUU,410960,412000,us
ocZPw3rVYUU,412000,414560,to know that germany is standing on
ocZPw3rVYUU,414560,416800,their side they know that germany is a
ocZPw3rVYUU,416800,419919,heavyweight in europe that they can help
ocZPw3rVYUU,419919,422240,make things happen and of course it is
ocZPw3rVYUU,422240,423440,important
ocZPw3rVYUU,423440,426479,that germany is being supported as the
ocZPw3rVYUU,426479,430240,host of this g7 meeting because they are
ocZPw3rVYUU,430240,431039,key
ocZPw3rVYUU,431039,433759,to ensure that this meeting is
ocZPw3rVYUU,433759,435520,a success
ocZPw3rVYUU,435520,437680,so a very warm and friendly meeting
ocZPw3rVYUU,437680,439520,between olive schultz and the u.s
ocZPw3rVYUU,439520,442080,president thomas do we know what else
ocZPw3rVYUU,442080,444400,they talked about aside from their
ocZPw3rVYUU,444400,446160,excellent relations well they spoke
ocZPw3rVYUU,446160,448720,about about germany defense and we heard
ocZPw3rVYUU,448720,450880,from from a white house official there
ocZPw3rVYUU,450880,453520,as well stressing that the the u.s was
ocZPw3rVYUU,453520,456160,very happy about the way germany had
ocZPw3rVYUU,456160,457599,announced that it would increase its
ocZPw3rVYUU,457599,460080,defense spending we heard about how the
ocZPw3rVYUU,460080,462319,two countries but more broadly the g7
ocZPw3rVYUU,462319,464960,could really continue to help ukraine
ocZPw3rVYUU,464960,466800,whether it is through further arms
ocZPw3rVYUU,466800,469120,shipments or politically uh there were
ocZPw3rVYUU,469120,470800,also discussions on some of the other
ocZPw3rVYUU,470800,472560,issues that are important when it comes
ocZPw3rVYUU,472560,474960,to to the g7 so it's not only about
ocZPw3rVYUU,474960,476639,ukraine and russia there are also other
ocZPw3rVYUU,476639,478319,issues on the agenda from climate change
ocZPw3rVYUU,478319,480479,to global global health so there was
ocZPw3rVYUU,480479,483039,also part of the discussion but as i as
ocZPw3rVYUU,483039,484400,i mentioned it is
ocZPw3rVYUU,484400,486479,really what comes to the to the detail
ocZPw3rVYUU,486479,488800,what's discussed behind the scenes that
ocZPw3rVYUU,488800,490960,we will then be able to see very clearly
ocZPw3rVYUU,490960,493280,when we see that final communicate that
ocZPw3rVYUU,493280,496560,final statement but symbolism certainly
ocZPw3rVYUU,496560,499440,plays a key role not only immediately
ocZPw3rVYUU,499440,501520,now but also when you look at the recent
ocZPw3rVYUU,501520,504080,history of u.s and german relations in
ocZPw3rVYUU,504080,506160,the past especially under donald trump
ocZPw3rVYUU,506160,508639,that relationship was really strained
ocZPw3rVYUU,508639,510879,and in previous big summits big
ocZPw3rVYUU,510879,512880,gatherings you could even notice that so
ocZPw3rVYUU,512880,515440,i'm sure that both governments both
ocZPw3rVYUU,515440,518000,teams from the german chancellor and the
ocZPw3rVYUU,518000,519839,u.s president were really adamant we're
ocZPw3rVYUU,519839,522159,really interested in showing this warm
ocZPw3rVYUU,522159,524240,and friendly environment between the two
ocZPw3rVYUU,524240,526240,leaders and that was very evident as
ocZPw3rVYUU,526240,528160,well in the few images that we got
ocZPw3rVYUU,528160,530480,before that bilateral meeting
ocZPw3rVYUU,530480,532399,well for our viewers if you are just
ocZPw3rVYUU,532399,534959,joining us we're waiting for a joint
ocZPw3rVYUU,534959,537760,press statement by the leaders of the g7
ocZPw3rVYUU,537760,540160,countries who are meeting at a summit
ocZPw3rVYUU,540160,542080,taking place in germany
ocZPw3rVYUU,542080,545040,and while we wait for the leaders to
ocZPw3rVYUU,545040,546959,speak to the press
ocZPw3rVYUU,546959,549360,we'd like to take you to the protests

ocZPw3rVYUU,555600,558160,demonstrators there are demanding swift
ocZPw3rVYUU,558160,560480,action on climate change and also an end

ocZPw3rVYUU,564800,567920,tackle global poverty and inequality
ocZPw3rVYUU,567920,569760,and with russia's war in ukraine
ocZPw3rVYUU,569760,572080,dominating the talks some demonstrators

ocZPw3rVYUU,584720,586640,them for us and i spoke to him a short
ocZPw3rVYUU,586640,587680,time ago
ocZPw3rVYUU,587680,589519,and asked him to tell us about the
ocZPw3rVYUU,589519,592160,situation there
