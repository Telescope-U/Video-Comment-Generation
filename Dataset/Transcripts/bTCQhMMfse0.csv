bTCQhMMfse0,240,3120,today's video was sponsored by carrots
bTCQhMMfse0,3120,4960,we're actually all right if you put
bTCQhMMfse0,4960,7120,other stuff on us i wouldn't consider my
bTCQhMMfse0,7120,10000,parents health nuts more like health
bTCQhMMfse0,10000,12160,kernels they would never buy unhealthy
bTCQhMMfse0,12160,14000,snacks but they wouldn't force me and my
bTCQhMMfse0,14000,15920,siblings to go outside and play because
bTCQhMMfse0,15920,17920,it was always burning hot and we just
bTCQhMMfse0,17920,19600,licked the melted candy off the sidewalk
bTCQhMMfse0,19600,21760,anyways they would never buy sugary
bTCQhMMfse0,21760,24240,cereal the most sugary cereal my parents
bTCQhMMfse0,24240,26800,got was honey nut cheerios but my mom
bTCQhMMfse0,26800,28480,would mix the honey nut cheerios with
bTCQhMMfse0,28480,30240,regular ones to make it more healthy or
bTCQhMMfse0,30240,32238,something so i would start every day
bTCQhMMfse0,32238,34239,spending 15 minutes picking out the
bTCQhMMfse0,34239,36000,regular cheerios from the cereal bowl
bTCQhMMfse0,36000,37440,that's right my parents didn't buy us
bTCQhMMfse0,37440,40079,cable cocoa puffs or candy
bTCQhMMfse0,40079,42000,my life sucked we were allowed to eat
bTCQhMMfse0,42000,43760,sugary cereal for one day out of the
bTCQhMMfse0,43760,46160,year and that was on christmas morning
bTCQhMMfse0,46160,47840,it's a fun tradition and we still do it
bTCQhMMfse0,47840,49760,to this day as a kid i would always get
bTCQhMMfse0,49760,50960,jealous when my friends would pull out
bTCQhMMfse0,50960,52480,their lunchables and tell me how much
bTCQhMMfse0,52480,54320,their family ate out and all the sugary
bTCQhMMfse0,54320,56239,cereals they got to eat meanwhile i had
bTCQhMMfse0,56239,58559,a pb j sandwich on wheat bread with the
bTCQhMMfse0,58559,60320,crust still on but it's okay cause i
bTCQhMMfse0,60320,62239,like the crust but now looking back i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,62239,64080,just so grateful that my mom cared
bTCQhMMfse0,64080,65920,enough about my health to instill these
bTCQhMMfse0,65920,67840,healthy eating habits into me at a young
bTCQhMMfse0,67840,69920,age i mean i don't follow them anymore
bTCQhMMfse0,69920,71200,because i live on my own and i don't
bTCQhMMfse0,71200,72560,know how to cook and bagel bites taste
bTCQhMMfse0,72560,74640,so darn good but i'm still thankful my
bTCQhMMfse0,74640,76720,mom taught me what i should be doing now
bTCQhMMfse0,76720,78080,if there's any parents watching this
bTCQhMMfse0,78080,81119,going hmm i like the way this james mom
bTCQhMMfse0,81119,83520,character thinks good i would recommend
bTCQhMMfse0,83520,84720,to all parents that you should be
bTCQhMMfse0,84720,86479,teaching your kids healthy eating habits
bTCQhMMfse0,86479,88560,as soon as possible i definitely didn't
bTCQhMMfse0,88560,90159,appreciate it at the time but now that
bTCQhMMfse0,90159,92159,i'm older and wiser i'm thankful that i
bTCQhMMfse0,92159,94000,like the taste of wheat bread my parents
bTCQhMMfse0,94000,96079,had a saying the wider the bread the
bTCQhMMfse0,96079,98000,sooner you're dead they would always get
bTCQhMMfse0,98000,99680,wheat bread even for hot dog and
bTCQhMMfse0,99680,101360,hamburger buns they got wheat some of
bTCQhMMfse0,101360,103040,you might have had to use sandwich bread
bTCQhMMfse0,103040,106159,as hot dog buns you're poor i get it but
bTCQhMMfse0,106159,107680,at least you didn't have to use wheat
bTCQhMMfse0,107680,110240,bread however now that i live on my own
bTCQhMMfse0,110240,112240,i still get the wheat bread because i
bTCQhMMfse0,112240,113920,don't want to die young i still have
bTCQhMMfse0,113920,116079,youtube videos to make some things never
bTCQhMMfse0,116079,118560,change i guess except i do get the white
bTCQhMMfse0,118560,120159,hot dog buns the wheat ones are still
bTCQhMMfse0,120159,122159,gross when i was a very little kid my
bTCQhMMfse0,122159,123840,dad's work was throwing a barbecue get
bTCQhMMfse0,123840,125680,together thing and i got to eat as many
bTCQhMMfse0,125680,127200,hot dogs on white bread as i could
bTCQhMMfse0,127200,129440,handle but the best part of it all was i
bTCQhMMfse0,129440,132560,got to wash it down with soda
bTCQhMMfse0,132560,134959,listen i was very sugar deprived back
bTCQhMMfse0,134959,136720,home i had to catch up on all the sugar
bTCQhMMfse0,136720,138400,i was missing out on i don't remember
bTCQhMMfse0,138400,140560,what the soda was exactly but let's just
bTCQhMMfse0,140560,142640,say for the sake of this story it was an
bTCQhMMfse0,142640,144800,original bottle of coke from the 1800s
bTCQhMMfse0,144800,146319,it might as well have had cocaine
bTCQhMMfse0,146319,148000,because i was addicted to all the white
bTCQhMMfse0,148000,149840,powdery stuff they added into that drink
bTCQhMMfse0,149840,151760,pretty soon my tummy started to get the
bTCQhMMfse0,151760,153519,rumblies and i had no idea what was
bTCQhMMfse0,153519,156400,causing it so i told my dad dad
bTCQhMMfse0,156400,159040,my tummy hurts and he said
bTCQhMMfse0,159040,160319,hmm
bTCQhMMfse0,160319,162319,it's probably because you're dehydrated
bTCQhMMfse0,162319,163920,here have some soda and i still
bTCQhMMfse0,163920,165599,respected my dad at that age and thought
bTCQhMMfse0,165599,167280,he knew what he was talking about so i
bTCQhMMfse0,167280,169760,drank more soda and then i threw up and
bTCQhMMfse0,169760,171200,my dad said
bTCQhMMfse0,171200,172720,we should leave i mentioned this next
bTCQhMMfse0,172720,174400,story in my first book available in
bTCQhMMfse0,174400,175599,bookstores near you be on the lookout
bTCQhMMfse0,175599,176720,for book number two coming out at the
bTCQhMMfse0,176720,178159,end of march but one time my mom bought
bTCQhMMfse0,178159,180239,a giant three pound bag of skittles i
bTCQhMMfse0,180239,181920,forgot what she bought them for but they
bTCQhMMfse0,181920,183519,definitely weren't for us she locked
bTCQhMMfse0,183519,185120,them away in a closet because she knew
bTCQhMMfse0,185120,186480,what us kids would do if we got our
bTCQhMMfse0,186480,188159,grubby little hands on the skittles this
bTCQhMMfse0,188159,190080,wasn't the first time my mom had to hide
bTCQhMMfse0,190080,192400,candy from us but this time she forgot
bTCQhMMfse0,192400,194800,to lock the closet leaving the skittles
bTCQhMMfse0,194800,196720,unprotected and me and my older brother
bTCQhMMfse0,196720,199120,ate the entire thing and we would have
bTCQhMMfse0,199120,201280,gotten away with it but then something
bTCQhMMfse0,201280,202319,came up
bTCQhMMfse0,202319,203920,puke i threw up on the family room
bTCQhMMfse0,203920,205840,carpet my mom saw how rainbow the throw
bTCQhMMfse0,205840,207599,up was and immediately put two and two
bTCQhMMfse0,207599,208879,together and knew that we had gotten
bTCQhMMfse0,208879,210560,into her skittles the funny part of this
bTCQhMMfse0,210560,212239,story is that my older brother got
bTCQhMMfse0,212239,214560,punished but i didn't because according
bTCQhMMfse0,214560,217360,to my mom i had already suffered enough
bTCQhMMfse0,217360,218799,and that's why that story is in the
bTCQhMMfse0,218799,220799,chapter titled perks of being the
bTCQhMMfse0,220799,223040,younger brother anyways don't eat so
bTCQhMMfse0,223040,224959,much candy that you throw up okay i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,224959,226400,going to be talking about m ms for a
bTCQhMMfse0,226400,228480,while so to make it go faster instead of
bTCQhMMfse0,228480,230560,saying m ms i'm just going to say
bTCQhMMfse0,230560,232319,in one of my older videos i said that my
bTCQhMMfse0,232319,234480,favorite candy bar was and every time i
bTCQhMMfse0,234480,235840,would tell people that they would always
bTCQhMMfse0,235840,236720,say
bTCQhMMfse0,236720,240080,that's not a candy bar
bTCQhMMfse0,240080,241680,i just
bTCQhMMfse0,241680,243519,i just can't do this anymore but then
bTCQhMMfse0,243519,245200,something interesting happened a year
bTCQhMMfse0,245200,247439,after that video was posted mmm actually
bTCQhMMfse0,247439,249519,released a bar version of their candy so
bTCQhMMfse0,249519,251840,now i can absolutely say that is my
bTCQhMMfse0,251840,253680,favorite candy bar and not get any weird
bTCQhMMfse0,253680,256079,looks someone at the marketing team sent
bTCQhMMfse0,256079,258560,me a box of candy bars and i think they
bTCQhMMfse0,258560,260720,wanted me to promote it but
bTCQhMMfse0,260720,262400,because i said that mmms are my favorite
bTCQhMMfse0,262400,264560,candy bar whenever i go to a convention
bTCQhMMfse0,264560,266880,sometimes you guys bring me candy which
bTCQhMMfse0,266880,268639,is very thoughtful but
bTCQhMMfse0,268639,270960,you know i like other things too like
bTCQhMMfse0,270960,274320,oreos and twix and money you know i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,274320,275840,just saying you don't have to bring me
bTCQhMMfse0,275840,277600,um all the time when i was visiting
bTCQhMMfse0,277600,279360,london i went to the store with my
bTCQhMMfse0,279360,281280,friends adam and mads and if you don't
bTCQhMMfse0,281280,283680,know about the london store it's four
bTCQhMMfse0,283680,286160,stories tall 35 000 square feet and
bTCQhMMfse0,286160,288479,according to wikipedia the largest sweet
bTCQhMMfse0,288479,290160,store in the world
bTCQhMMfse0,290160,292160,so it was kinda big once i stepped
bTCQhMMfse0,292160,294320,inside my first thought was
bTCQhMMfse0,294320,296160,okay this is too much it was like the
bTCQhMMfse0,296160,298479,candy forest scene in willy wonka except
bTCQhMMfse0,298479,300639,it was all chocolate and expensive in
bTCQhMMfse0,300639,302000,one part of the store you could make
bTCQhMMfse0,302000,304320,your own customs with a picture and two
bTCQhMMfse0,304320,306639,phrases so for the picture i googled my
bTCQhMMfse0,306639,308560,cartoon self held up my phone to the
bTCQhMMfse0,308560,310800,camera and it bloody worked bite and for
bTCQhMMfse0,310800,312560,the phrases naturally we wanted to write
bTCQhMMfse0,312560,314080,something that was meaningful so we
bTCQhMMfse0,314080,317280,wrote mad stinks and adam smells but the
bTCQhMMfse0,317280,318800,employee didn't allow us to write that
bTCQhMMfse0,318800,320880,because it was too negative and went
bTCQhMMfse0,320880,321919,against the
bTCQhMMfse0,321919,324000,brand so knowing we were not allowed to
bTCQhMMfse0,324000,325600,roast each other the next phrases we
bTCQhMMfse0,325600,328240,decided to print was get mads and
bTCQhMMfse0,328240,331039,something else yt it wasn't creative but
bTCQhMMfse0,331039,332639,without being able to make fun of each
bTCQhMMfse0,332639,334320,other we didn't have a lot to work with
bTCQhMMfse0,334320,336639,but those phrases weren't allowed either
bTCQhMMfse0,336639,338000,because they were the names of some
bTCQhMMfse0,338000,340080,youtubers so they got flagged by the
bTCQhMMfse0,340080,341840,system and they told us you'll need
bTCQhMMfse0,341840,343759,permission from the youtuber even though
bTCQhMMfse0,343759,345919,you're both right here listen boys i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,345919,348960,just a employee i don't want to get sued
bTCQhMMfse0,348960,351039,on one hand i'm glad that um has a
bTCQhMMfse0,351039,352720,system in place to prevent people from
bTCQhMMfse0,352720,355440,stealing but on the other hand it's just
bTCQhMMfse0,355440,357440,mmms what do you think we're gonna do
bTCQhMMfse0,357440,359680,with them so after two failed attempts
bTCQhMMfse0,359680,361280,at getting the phrase we wanted we
bTCQhMMfse0,361280,362800,settled on getting
bTCQhMMfse0,362800,363919,adam
bTCQhMMfse0,363919,366960,and madds at least i still got my
bTCQhMMfse0,366960,369039,cannonball guy printed even though
bTCQhMMfse0,369039,373120,technically this image is copyrighted so
bTCQhMMfse0,373120,375280,um you'll be hearing from my lawyers
bTCQhMMfse0,375280,377600,soon one of the disadvantages of being a
bTCQhMMfse0,377600,380000,youtuber is the lack of benefits we
bTCQhMMfse0,380000,382080,don't even have dental and with all the
bTCQhMMfse0,382080,383919,junk food i'm eating and the flossing
bTCQhMMfse0,383919,386479,i'm not doing i should probably see one
bTCQhMMfse0,386479,388479,can i confess something i didn't know
bTCQhMMfse0,388479,390639,dentists were optional i thought they
bTCQhMMfse0,390639,392639,summoned you to their offices like jury
bTCQhMMfse0,392639,394319,duty that's what it felt like when i was
bTCQhMMfse0,394319,396639,a kid i've never gotten a cavity though
bTCQhMMfse0,396639,398400,at least not one that i know of so at
bTCQhMMfse0,398400,400000,least i'm doing something right now
bTCQhMMfse0,400000,401360,comes the part of the video where i give
bTCQhMMfse0,401360,403680,you advice on eating healthy but i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,403680,405600,still working on that myself and when i
bTCQhMMfse0,405600,407120,don't know what to eat i can't help but
bTCQhMMfse0,407120,409039,biting down on a delicious carrot
bTCQhMMfse0,409039,410639,carrots are the most popular vegetable
bTCQhMMfse0,410639,412400,in the world having been nominated as
bTCQhMMfse0,412400,415120,the best orange thing ever use code odd
bTCQhMMfse0,415120,416639,one next time you purchase a carrot to
bTCQhMMfse0,416639,419120,get 5 000 free carrot points and a bunch
bTCQhMMfse0,419120,421039,of weird looks at the grocery store give
bTCQhMMfse0,421039,423120,your body the fuel it needs you wouldn't
bTCQhMMfse0,423120,425360,pour soda in a car engine and expect it
bTCQhMMfse0,425360,427120,to run of course that's not really the
bTCQhMMfse0,427120,429199,best metaphor to use because you also
bTCQhMMfse0,429199,430960,wouldn't pour water into a car and
bTCQhMMfse0,430960,432800,expect it to run i guess everyone drink
bTCQhMMfse0,432800,434880,gasoline because cars and people are the
bTCQhMMfse0,434880,437280,same but the point is you've only got
bTCQhMMfse0,437280,439759,one body so you should take care of it
bTCQhMMfse0,439759,441759,hey guys hope you enjoyed the first
bTCQhMMfse0,441759,444639,video of 2020 did any of you eat sugary

bTCQhMMfse0,7120,10000,parents health nuts more like health
bTCQhMMfse0,10000,12160,kernels they would never buy unhealthy
bTCQhMMfse0,12160,14000,snacks but they wouldn't force me and my
bTCQhMMfse0,14000,15920,siblings to go outside and play because
bTCQhMMfse0,15920,17920,it was always burning hot and we just
bTCQhMMfse0,17920,19600,licked the melted candy off the sidewalk
bTCQhMMfse0,19600,21760,anyways they would never buy sugary
bTCQhMMfse0,21760,24240,cereal the most sugary cereal my parents
bTCQhMMfse0,24240,26800,got was honey nut cheerios but my mom
bTCQhMMfse0,26800,28480,would mix the honey nut cheerios with
bTCQhMMfse0,28480,30240,regular ones to make it more healthy or
bTCQhMMfse0,30240,32238,something so i would start every day
bTCQhMMfse0,32238,34239,spending 15 minutes picking out the
bTCQhMMfse0,34239,36000,regular cheerios from the cereal bowl
bTCQhMMfse0,36000,37440,that's right my parents didn't buy us
bTCQhMMfse0,37440,40079,cable cocoa puffs or candy
bTCQhMMfse0,40079,42000,my life sucked we were allowed to eat
bTCQhMMfse0,42000,43760,sugary cereal for one day out of the
bTCQhMMfse0,43760,46160,year and that was on christmas morning
bTCQhMMfse0,46160,47840,it's a fun tradition and we still do it
bTCQhMMfse0,47840,49760,to this day as a kid i would always get
bTCQhMMfse0,49760,50960,jealous when my friends would pull out
bTCQhMMfse0,50960,52480,their lunchables and tell me how much
bTCQhMMfse0,52480,54320,their family ate out and all the sugary
bTCQhMMfse0,54320,56239,cereals they got to eat meanwhile i had
bTCQhMMfse0,56239,58559,a pb j sandwich on wheat bread with the
bTCQhMMfse0,58559,60320,crust still on but it's okay cause i
bTCQhMMfse0,60320,62239,like the crust but now looking back i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,62239,64080,just so grateful that my mom cared
bTCQhMMfse0,64080,65920,enough about my health to instill these
bTCQhMMfse0,65920,67840,healthy eating habits into me at a young
bTCQhMMfse0,67840,69920,age i mean i don't follow them anymore
bTCQhMMfse0,69920,71200,because i live on my own and i don't
bTCQhMMfse0,71200,72560,know how to cook and bagel bites taste
bTCQhMMfse0,72560,74640,so darn good but i'm still thankful my
bTCQhMMfse0,74640,76720,mom taught me what i should be doing now
bTCQhMMfse0,76720,78080,if there's any parents watching this
bTCQhMMfse0,78080,81119,going hmm i like the way this james mom
bTCQhMMfse0,81119,83520,character thinks good i would recommend
bTCQhMMfse0,83520,84720,to all parents that you should be
bTCQhMMfse0,84720,86479,teaching your kids healthy eating habits
bTCQhMMfse0,86479,88560,as soon as possible i definitely didn't
bTCQhMMfse0,88560,90159,appreciate it at the time but now that
bTCQhMMfse0,90159,92159,i'm older and wiser i'm thankful that i
bTCQhMMfse0,92159,94000,like the taste of wheat bread my parents
bTCQhMMfse0,94000,96079,had a saying the wider the bread the
bTCQhMMfse0,96079,98000,sooner you're dead they would always get
bTCQhMMfse0,98000,99680,wheat bread even for hot dog and
bTCQhMMfse0,99680,101360,hamburger buns they got wheat some of
bTCQhMMfse0,101360,103040,you might have had to use sandwich bread
bTCQhMMfse0,103040,106159,as hot dog buns you're poor i get it but
bTCQhMMfse0,106159,107680,at least you didn't have to use wheat
bTCQhMMfse0,107680,110240,bread however now that i live on my own
bTCQhMMfse0,110240,112240,i still get the wheat bread because i
bTCQhMMfse0,112240,113920,don't want to die young i still have
bTCQhMMfse0,113920,116079,youtube videos to make some things never
bTCQhMMfse0,116079,118560,change i guess except i do get the white
bTCQhMMfse0,118560,120159,hot dog buns the wheat ones are still
bTCQhMMfse0,120159,122159,gross when i was a very little kid my
bTCQhMMfse0,122159,123840,dad's work was throwing a barbecue get
bTCQhMMfse0,123840,125680,together thing and i got to eat as many
bTCQhMMfse0,125680,127200,hot dogs on white bread as i could
bTCQhMMfse0,127200,129440,handle but the best part of it all was i
bTCQhMMfse0,129440,132560,got to wash it down with soda
bTCQhMMfse0,132560,134959,listen i was very sugar deprived back
bTCQhMMfse0,134959,136720,home i had to catch up on all the sugar
bTCQhMMfse0,136720,138400,i was missing out on i don't remember
bTCQhMMfse0,138400,140560,what the soda was exactly but let's just
bTCQhMMfse0,140560,142640,say for the sake of this story it was an
bTCQhMMfse0,142640,144800,original bottle of coke from the 1800s
bTCQhMMfse0,144800,146319,it might as well have had cocaine
bTCQhMMfse0,146319,148000,because i was addicted to all the white
bTCQhMMfse0,148000,149840,powdery stuff they added into that drink
bTCQhMMfse0,149840,151760,pretty soon my tummy started to get the
bTCQhMMfse0,151760,153519,rumblies and i had no idea what was
bTCQhMMfse0,153519,156400,causing it so i told my dad dad
bTCQhMMfse0,156400,159040,my tummy hurts and he said
bTCQhMMfse0,159040,160319,hmm
bTCQhMMfse0,160319,162319,it's probably because you're dehydrated
bTCQhMMfse0,162319,163920,here have some soda and i still
bTCQhMMfse0,163920,165599,respected my dad at that age and thought
bTCQhMMfse0,165599,167280,he knew what he was talking about so i
bTCQhMMfse0,167280,169760,drank more soda and then i threw up and
bTCQhMMfse0,169760,171200,my dad said
bTCQhMMfse0,171200,172720,we should leave i mentioned this next
bTCQhMMfse0,172720,174400,story in my first book available in
bTCQhMMfse0,174400,175599,bookstores near you be on the lookout
bTCQhMMfse0,175599,176720,for book number two coming out at the
bTCQhMMfse0,176720,178159,end of march but one time my mom bought
bTCQhMMfse0,178159,180239,a giant three pound bag of skittles i
bTCQhMMfse0,180239,181920,forgot what she bought them for but they
bTCQhMMfse0,181920,183519,definitely weren't for us she locked
bTCQhMMfse0,183519,185120,them away in a closet because she knew
bTCQhMMfse0,185120,186480,what us kids would do if we got our
bTCQhMMfse0,186480,188159,grubby little hands on the skittles this
bTCQhMMfse0,188159,190080,wasn't the first time my mom had to hide
bTCQhMMfse0,190080,192400,candy from us but this time she forgot
bTCQhMMfse0,192400,194800,to lock the closet leaving the skittles
bTCQhMMfse0,194800,196720,unprotected and me and my older brother
bTCQhMMfse0,196720,199120,ate the entire thing and we would have
bTCQhMMfse0,199120,201280,gotten away with it but then something
bTCQhMMfse0,201280,202319,came up
bTCQhMMfse0,202319,203920,puke i threw up on the family room
bTCQhMMfse0,203920,205840,carpet my mom saw how rainbow the throw
bTCQhMMfse0,205840,207599,up was and immediately put two and two
bTCQhMMfse0,207599,208879,together and knew that we had gotten
bTCQhMMfse0,208879,210560,into her skittles the funny part of this
bTCQhMMfse0,210560,212239,story is that my older brother got
bTCQhMMfse0,212239,214560,punished but i didn't because according
bTCQhMMfse0,214560,217360,to my mom i had already suffered enough
bTCQhMMfse0,217360,218799,and that's why that story is in the
bTCQhMMfse0,218799,220799,chapter titled perks of being the
bTCQhMMfse0,220799,223040,younger brother anyways don't eat so
bTCQhMMfse0,223040,224959,much candy that you throw up okay i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,224959,226400,going to be talking about m ms for a
bTCQhMMfse0,226400,228480,while so to make it go faster instead of
bTCQhMMfse0,228480,230560,saying m ms i'm just going to say
bTCQhMMfse0,230560,232319,in one of my older videos i said that my
bTCQhMMfse0,232319,234480,favorite candy bar was and every time i
bTCQhMMfse0,234480,235840,would tell people that they would always
bTCQhMMfse0,235840,236720,say
bTCQhMMfse0,236720,240080,that's not a candy bar
bTCQhMMfse0,240080,241680,i just
bTCQhMMfse0,241680,243519,i just can't do this anymore but then
bTCQhMMfse0,243519,245200,something interesting happened a year
bTCQhMMfse0,245200,247439,after that video was posted mmm actually
bTCQhMMfse0,247439,249519,released a bar version of their candy so
bTCQhMMfse0,249519,251840,now i can absolutely say that is my
bTCQhMMfse0,251840,253680,favorite candy bar and not get any weird
bTCQhMMfse0,253680,256079,looks someone at the marketing team sent
bTCQhMMfse0,256079,258560,me a box of candy bars and i think they
bTCQhMMfse0,258560,260720,wanted me to promote it but
bTCQhMMfse0,260720,262400,because i said that mmms are my favorite
bTCQhMMfse0,262400,264560,candy bar whenever i go to a convention
bTCQhMMfse0,264560,266880,sometimes you guys bring me candy which
bTCQhMMfse0,266880,268639,is very thoughtful but
bTCQhMMfse0,268639,270960,you know i like other things too like
bTCQhMMfse0,270960,274320,oreos and twix and money you know i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,274320,275840,just saying you don't have to bring me
bTCQhMMfse0,275840,277600,um all the time when i was visiting
bTCQhMMfse0,277600,279360,london i went to the store with my
bTCQhMMfse0,279360,281280,friends adam and mads and if you don't
bTCQhMMfse0,281280,283680,know about the london store it's four
bTCQhMMfse0,283680,286160,stories tall 35 000 square feet and
bTCQhMMfse0,286160,288479,according to wikipedia the largest sweet
bTCQhMMfse0,288479,290160,store in the world
bTCQhMMfse0,290160,292160,so it was kinda big once i stepped
bTCQhMMfse0,292160,294320,inside my first thought was
bTCQhMMfse0,294320,296160,okay this is too much it was like the
bTCQhMMfse0,296160,298479,candy forest scene in willy wonka except
bTCQhMMfse0,298479,300639,it was all chocolate and expensive in
bTCQhMMfse0,300639,302000,one part of the store you could make
bTCQhMMfse0,302000,304320,your own customs with a picture and two
bTCQhMMfse0,304320,306639,phrases so for the picture i googled my
bTCQhMMfse0,306639,308560,cartoon self held up my phone to the
bTCQhMMfse0,308560,310800,camera and it bloody worked bite and for
bTCQhMMfse0,310800,312560,the phrases naturally we wanted to write
bTCQhMMfse0,312560,314080,something that was meaningful so we
bTCQhMMfse0,314080,317280,wrote mad stinks and adam smells but the
bTCQhMMfse0,317280,318800,employee didn't allow us to write that
bTCQhMMfse0,318800,320880,because it was too negative and went
bTCQhMMfse0,320880,321919,against the
bTCQhMMfse0,321919,324000,brand so knowing we were not allowed to
bTCQhMMfse0,324000,325600,roast each other the next phrases we
bTCQhMMfse0,325600,328240,decided to print was get mads and
bTCQhMMfse0,328240,331039,something else yt it wasn't creative but
bTCQhMMfse0,331039,332639,without being able to make fun of each
bTCQhMMfse0,332639,334320,other we didn't have a lot to work with
bTCQhMMfse0,334320,336639,but those phrases weren't allowed either
bTCQhMMfse0,336639,338000,because they were the names of some
bTCQhMMfse0,338000,340080,youtubers so they got flagged by the
bTCQhMMfse0,340080,341840,system and they told us you'll need
bTCQhMMfse0,341840,343759,permission from the youtuber even though
bTCQhMMfse0,343759,345919,you're both right here listen boys i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,345919,348960,just a employee i don't want to get sued
bTCQhMMfse0,348960,351039,on one hand i'm glad that um has a
bTCQhMMfse0,351039,352720,system in place to prevent people from
bTCQhMMfse0,352720,355440,stealing but on the other hand it's just
bTCQhMMfse0,355440,357440,mmms what do you think we're gonna do
bTCQhMMfse0,357440,359680,with them so after two failed attempts
bTCQhMMfse0,359680,361280,at getting the phrase we wanted we
bTCQhMMfse0,361280,362800,settled on getting
bTCQhMMfse0,362800,363919,adam
bTCQhMMfse0,363919,366960,and madds at least i still got my
bTCQhMMfse0,366960,369039,cannonball guy printed even though
bTCQhMMfse0,369039,373120,technically this image is copyrighted so
bTCQhMMfse0,373120,375280,um you'll be hearing from my lawyers
bTCQhMMfse0,375280,377600,soon one of the disadvantages of being a
bTCQhMMfse0,377600,380000,youtuber is the lack of benefits we
bTCQhMMfse0,380000,382080,don't even have dental and with all the
bTCQhMMfse0,382080,383919,junk food i'm eating and the flossing
bTCQhMMfse0,383919,386479,i'm not doing i should probably see one
bTCQhMMfse0,386479,388479,can i confess something i didn't know
bTCQhMMfse0,388479,390639,dentists were optional i thought they
bTCQhMMfse0,390639,392639,summoned you to their offices like jury
bTCQhMMfse0,392639,394319,duty that's what it felt like when i was
bTCQhMMfse0,394319,396639,a kid i've never gotten a cavity though
bTCQhMMfse0,396639,398400,at least not one that i know of so at
bTCQhMMfse0,398400,400000,least i'm doing something right now
bTCQhMMfse0,400000,401360,comes the part of the video where i give
bTCQhMMfse0,401360,403680,you advice on eating healthy but i'm
bTCQhMMfse0,403680,405600,still working on that myself and when i
bTCQhMMfse0,405600,407120,don't know what to eat i can't help but
bTCQhMMfse0,407120,409039,biting down on a delicious carrot
bTCQhMMfse0,409039,410639,carrots are the most popular vegetable
bTCQhMMfse0,410639,412400,in the world having been nominated as
bTCQhMMfse0,412400,415120,the best orange thing ever use code odd
bTCQhMMfse0,415120,416639,one next time you purchase a carrot to
bTCQhMMfse0,416639,419120,get 5 000 free carrot points and a bunch
bTCQhMMfse0,419120,421039,of weird looks at the grocery store give
bTCQhMMfse0,421039,423120,your body the fuel it needs you wouldn't
bTCQhMMfse0,423120,425360,pour soda in a car engine and expect it
bTCQhMMfse0,425360,427120,to run of course that's not really the
bTCQhMMfse0,427120,429199,best metaphor to use because you also
bTCQhMMfse0,429199,430960,wouldn't pour water into a car and
bTCQhMMfse0,430960,432800,expect it to run i guess everyone drink
bTCQhMMfse0,432800,434880,gasoline because cars and people are the
bTCQhMMfse0,434880,437280,same but the point is you've only got
bTCQhMMfse0,437280,439759,one body so you should take care of it
bTCQhMMfse0,439759,441759,hey guys hope you enjoyed the first
bTCQhMMfse0,441759,444639,video of 2020 did any of you eat sugary
