7XNPImfg008,17680,24160,future um and we've got a special guest  reviews as always we've got dharma chef  from sky sports damage thanks for coming
7XNPImfg008,24160,30160,back on the channel  thank you very much for having me jay  ronaldo you're well yeah we're good i
7XNPImfg008,30160,38079,see diamond she's wearing white are you  happy with that exactly he's got the  same haircut as well  [Laughter]
7XNPImfg008,38079,43240,i had to bring that into it yeah this is  what i have to pour with diamonds it's a  real thing you know you shouldn't even  be shaking mix
7XNPImfg008,43240,49840,[Laughter]  we'll get straight  i know i'm sorry about i apologize
7XNPImfg008,49840,56399,we'll get straight into it um at the  time of recording this there's lots of  reports that the young second bit by
7XNPImfg008,56399,61920,manchester united could be imminent um  can you give us an update on what that  bid could look like and whether you
7XNPImfg008,61920,67680,think barcelona would be willing to  accept it  the way i see the situation let's be
7XNPImfg008,67680,72799,clear about it that the number one  priority  in this transfer window for manchester
7XNPImfg008,72799,78799,united is central midfield and frankie  deyoung is the number one target it just
7XNPImfg008,78799,84400,feels to me at the moment it's a game of  brinkmanship between barcelona and  manchester united
7XNPImfg008,84400,90400,barcelona want to get the highest  possible price they can  but manchester united are also very well
7XNPImfg008,90400,96560,aware of the financial problems that  barcelona have got so they don't want to  go in too early in this transfer window
7XNPImfg008,96560,102560,i know much to the angst of some  manchester united fans were saying let's  get this deal done  but if you look at it from a manchester
7XNPImfg008,102560,109680,united's perspective if they did it very  very quickly chances are that have  played into barcelona's hands and paying
7XNPImfg008,109680,116159,them exactly what they want which they  don't feel is a reasonable price  on the flip side i think barcelona are
7XNPImfg008,116159,122079,well aware that manchester united  haven't made any signings in this  transfer window so far and they might
7XNPImfg008,122079,128879,think that manchester united are  desperate hence why they're kind of  standing firm on their price when i say
7XNPImfg008,128879,134560,brinkmanship it's going to come a time  where  there's going to have to be a compromise  on both sides barcelona will probably
7XNPImfg008,134560,140000,have to come down in their valuation  united will probably have to move up on  their valuation but
7XNPImfg008,140000,146400,having said that even though it's gone  this far the information that i'm  getting is that united would be prepared
7XNPImfg008,146400,151440,to walk away from the deal if they don't  get what they feel is a reasonable fee
7XNPImfg008,151440,158319,and a reasonable price for frankie the  young but there's a growing belief that  there's a willingness from all parties
7XNPImfg008,158319,164400,to get a deal done there is a deal to be  done because just by definition alone  they've gone this far and we're still
7XNPImfg008,164400,171200,talking about the fact that they're in  talks  that there must be a willingness for  more parties yes we do want to get a
7XNPImfg008,171200,176640,deal done barcelona will always stay the  right things in public we want frankie  deyoung to stay
7XNPImfg008,176640,183120,the agents uh surrounding the deal will  probably say look frankie deyoung is  happy at barcelona manchester united
7XNPImfg008,183120,188720,will remain tight-lipped publicly about  the whole situation because they don't  want to put their cards out on the table
7XNPImfg008,188720,195920,just yet because they don't want to  influence the the transfer fee in any  way so like i said i think there's just
7XNPImfg008,195920,201040,various things going on behind the  scenes  and if this deal gets done
7XNPImfg008,201040,207599,i'm sure  everyone  um both clubs will definitely be  briefing that they said they'll be happy
7XNPImfg008,207599,213519,with any kind of deal that happens  yeah i hope it does get done because it  does feel i know it's only early days in
7XNPImfg008,213519,220159,the transfer window but it does almost  feel like it's turned into a little bit  a little bit of a sound that's that's  one of my biggest concerns yeah but
7XNPImfg008,220159,226400,we're going to go now one of the biggest  concerns is united running out of time  in terms of chase and diong and then not
7XNPImfg008,226400,232560,being able to i would look for  alternatives or balls to other areas  because another  player that united have been linked to
7XNPImfg008,232560,238000,and he's also reported on the sky that  you know i've opened talks with his  anthony and i'm wondering how that deal
7XNPImfg008,238000,243439,was progressing at a moment because it  seemed like united were kind of looking  at a 40 million pound bid or something
7XNPImfg008,243439,249040,along the lines of got any idea how that  deal was progressing at the moment  what i would say about running out of
7XNPImfg008,249040,257040,time i think jay mentioned it that  we're only about two weeks into the  transfer window i think what's been
7XNPImfg008,257040,262960,influenced in in how united are  perceived so far in this transfer window
7XNPImfg008,262960,268800,is what liverpool and manchester city  have been doing  would manchester united fans
7XNPImfg008,268800,275840,on social media in particular be  thinking why are we not completing deals  had city not sorted out horland and
7XNPImfg008,275840,281840,liverpool sorted out darwin nunes so  quickly i think of there is mitigating  circumstances with regard to united
7XNPImfg008,281840,287520,because look they've got a new manager  and  eric tenharg probably wants to have a
7XNPImfg008,287520,292800,look at what's in the squad as well i  mean united fans like yourselves will  say
7XNPImfg008,292800,298800,he's not good enough he's good enough he  should be getting rid of him he should  be signing him the fact of the matter is
7XNPImfg008,298800,305280,is  history is shown in football but  particularly in the recent history of  manchester united it is much easier to
7XNPImfg008,305280,312560,change a manager than it is to change  players because managers you can pay off  at a minimal cost whereas
7XNPImfg008,312560,319280,players  well i say minimal costs of course that  there is a lot of um  compensation associated with them but
7XNPImfg008,319280,326000,players some of them  who a manager might not like are on  long-term contracts and it's easy to say
7XNPImfg008,326000,332080,right  let's just sell him  but in practice how actually easy is
7XNPImfg008,332080,337360,that to do so i think 10 hog wants to  look at what's at the squad first but
7XNPImfg008,337360,343199,he's under no illusions he knows how  they performed last season and he's seen  a number of players already leave the
7XNPImfg008,343199,349840,club look pogba's on his way to juventus  on a free transfer jesse lingard's  contract is up he's out of the club now
7XNPImfg008,349840,355680,as well matic mata cavani they've all  left so numbers wise
7XNPImfg008,355680,361680,i think united need to improve anyway  but they need to get that quality in as  well and i think 10 hog will want to
7XNPImfg008,361680,367840,assess everything  as well as bringing in players that he  probably knows and it brings me on to
7XNPImfg008,367840,374319,what ronaldo said about  anthony that seems to be a running theme  doesn't there with regard to manchester
7XNPImfg008,374319,382160,united's targets here frankie deyoung  yes he's at barcelona but who did he  play under iax eric tenharg anthony was
7XNPImfg008,382160,388400,a regular under eric tenhard in the past  couple of seasons the the information  that i've been given so far on that deal
7XNPImfg008,388400,395919,is yes there is a strong and a genuine  interest  and united  want to you know formally uh put a bid
7XNPImfg008,395919,401199,in with ayax and talk to ayax but i  think  that one also
7XNPImfg008,401199,406319,is a difficult one to do simply because  anthony is under a long-term contract at
7XNPImfg008,406319,412240,iax then you've got the likes of um  yuri and timber who was linked with
7XNPImfg008,412240,417599,united and i think  there's a possibility that if we believe  everything we we hear louis van gaal
7XNPImfg008,417599,422720,might have of all people might have  scuppered that one because he said look  you need to be playing regular first
7XNPImfg008,422720,428240,team football but  with regard to united the defense is  kind of like the lowest priority but
7XNPImfg008,428240,436400,with anthony yes definite genuine  interest i think midfield is number one  priority and improving the forward line
7XNPImfg008,436400,443599,not necessarily bringing in a number  nine but improving the forward line  isn't is is priority number two so
7XNPImfg008,443599,449440,anthony would fit that bill and it's  someone that eric tenhard knows very  very well
7XNPImfg008,449440,454880,do you believe that similarly to the way  that the young saga is going that and it  could end up being a little bit of a
7XNPImfg008,454880,460639,drawn out  negotiation process rather than united  getting it done fairly quickly because
7XNPImfg008,460639,466720,i actually recently set some quite high  evaluations on some of their players  because i don't think they have an  agreement with ten hog that they didn't
7XNPImfg008,466720,474720,want  their squad being decimated when he did  come to united so i feel like they are  going to be quite hard to bargain with
7XNPImfg008,474720,479919,ruby but i mean look eric tenharg has  come in and he will want to work with
7XNPImfg008,479919,485199,players who he knows and he trusts it's  no real surprise that
7XNPImfg008,485199,492160,the iax link is going to be there  because he wants to play in a particular  way at united and he's going to need the
7XNPImfg008,492160,498080,players  who are up to speed with his philosophy  so it's
7XNPImfg008,498080,504319,it's no surprise that he he is going  back to his old club that's not to say  that he's going to go back to his old
7XNPImfg008,504319,510080,club and and sign six or seven players  there but there is obvious and genuine
7XNPImfg008,510080,515518,interest in anthony and there is obvious  and genuine interest and a bid of course
7XNPImfg008,515518,522240,with with frankie deyoung who used to be  at iax as well will it be a long  drawn-out saga
7XNPImfg008,522240,528000,defined long drawn-out saga i think  united privately probably are quite  relaxed
7XNPImfg008,528000,534560,in the in that they are trying to do  things the proper way they are trying to  take a step back this time
7XNPImfg008,534560,541519,and say we need to do our business  properly we don't want to overpay we are  prepared to walk away from deals if we
7XNPImfg008,541519,549279,don't feel we're getting the right deal  that's there for manchester united now  fans will often look back and when they
7XNPImfg008,549279,556000,reflect on certain transfers that have  been made at united the argument has  been why did they rush into that one why
7XNPImfg008,556000,563200,didn't they take their time but then by  the same token those same fans will  criticize when united aren't making a
7XNPImfg008,563200,569920,move on and getting a transfer so i  don't think they can win in one way but  i think they're comfortable with how
7XNPImfg008,569920,577279,they are approaching this window they've  got their trust in john murto to be able  to do these deals and he's doing it with
7XNPImfg008,577279,583279,um a bit of you know data analysis  strongly linked into every single
7XNPImfg008,583279,589360,purchase that they make to make sure  that it's not just a signing that
7XNPImfg008,589360,594640,united fans will get excited about but a  signing that united fans will recognize
7XNPImfg008,594640,600080,will fit into the philosophy of the  manager going forward  um you've
7XNPImfg008,600080,605920,sort of reported as well that a defender  is is less of a priority for for  manchester united you know you've
7XNPImfg008,605920,611440,mentioned their other other areas  they're looking at is that one of the  reasons behind the the timber deal
7XNPImfg008,611440,616839,stalling or is is it because united  looking other things or is the there are  other reasons that that's not that's not
7XNPImfg008,616839,624320,happened if you believe what you read i  mean louis van gaal might have had a say  in the timber situation because
7XNPImfg008,624320,630160,he he actually said that you've got to  be playing first team football regularly  now the issue with united at the moment
7XNPImfg008,630160,635519,look  if you ask a lot of united fans and i'm  sure you're getting lots of
7XNPImfg008,635519,641839,um  tweets on your inbox um jay ronaldo i'm  sure you are about why they're not
7XNPImfg008,641839,647360,strengthening the defense united's  defense is not good enough  that's one way to look at it but
7XNPImfg008,647360,654640,regardless of that  i think the reasoning behind the defense  not being the number one priority is
7XNPImfg008,654640,661680,because of the numbers that exist there  it's not to say that they're not looking  at defenders they are they are looking
7XNPImfg008,661680,667760,at the likes of yuri and timber they are  looking at the likes of villarreal pao  torres who they've been linked with
7XNPImfg008,667760,674320,before and has been linked with a number  of premier league clubs as well and look  he he had a taste and a strong taste of
7XNPImfg008,674320,681760,champions league football last season  when villarreal got to the semi-finals  will that have an impact on if he was to
7XNPImfg008,681760,688560,move where he would move to united at  this stage can't offer champions league  football so would that have an impact on
7XNPImfg008,688560,695279,any potential incomings but the fact of  the matter is now i'm not going to talk  about the quality of manchester united's
7XNPImfg008,695279,701279,defenders  all i can tell you is the facts and that  is the numbers that exist in that area
7XNPImfg008,701279,707760,and you're already looking at varane  mcguire  phil jones eric bailly and victor
7XNPImfg008,707760,713760,lindelof five central defenders now  like i was saying earlier on it's so
7XNPImfg008,713760,718880,easy to say right just get rid of two of  them and bring in two others
7XNPImfg008,718880,724399,so much easier said than done these guys  are under contract and as much as united
7XNPImfg008,724399,729519,might think  we want to offload a couple and bring a  couple in it's going to be up to the
7XNPImfg008,729519,736720,player as well if they're under contract  they will hold the power they don't need  to go anywhere so it will be up to the
7XNPImfg008,736720,742320,player but if if the manager says look  you are not in my plans and they can get
7XNPImfg008,742320,749040,a deal done  then i think there is  processes in place whereby united are
7XNPImfg008,749040,756480,looking at that position all i'm saying  is that central midfield is what i'm  told is the number one priority
7XNPImfg008,756480,761600,improving the forward line is number two  priority and number three priority is
7XNPImfg008,761600,767760,the defense but i think  that comes down to numbers rather than  anything else do you think that sort of
7XNPImfg008,767760,773360,killed that one then with timber the the  van gaal influence and the fact that you  know coupled with the fact that
7XNPImfg008,773360,779920,obviously it's not a prior age you think  that that one the timber to unite it  doesn't look likely now  it's an interesting one isn't it because
7XNPImfg008,779920,786079,uh  manchester united fans must have been  looking at with dread at every single  louis van gaal news conference
7XNPImfg008,786079,792000,effectively telling eric 10 hard not to  said questions  yeah don't yeah
7XNPImfg008,792000,799279,he's not exactly selling us is it to the  to the dutch continental commercial club  um not happy about the way he left maybe
7XNPImfg008,799279,805760,and then um  maybe advising  um yuri and timber look if you're not
7XNPImfg008,805760,812880,going to get first in football you're  not going to be in my world cup squad  and i think this is i think the world  cup being in the middle of the season as
7XNPImfg008,812880,818560,well may influence certain players not  just coming to united but at every club
7XNPImfg008,818560,824240,simply because  if they're in the squad now and they  start the season with only four months
7XNPImfg008,824240,831040,to go and then find themselves out  of the team that they're in  their world cup place is that threat
7XNPImfg008,831040,836800,isn't it so  it's a real real conundrum for certain  players and for clubs as well on the
7XNPImfg008,836800,842959,flip side  the introduction of five substitutions  next season i think that could have an
7XNPImfg008,842959,849760,impact  uh certainly on how clubs do their  business because  whereas before you've got a 20-man squad
7XNPImfg008,849760,856720,going to every premier league game and  of the nine substitutes you've got a  three in nine chance of being called
7XNPImfg008,856720,862480,upon whereas five substitutions  possibility you could use all of them
7XNPImfg008,862480,869519,and then that is another way that a  manager can keep a big squad full of  quality players a little bit more happy
7XNPImfg008,869519,875600,compared to if if they've only again  used three of those substitutions and  you'll find that some players are simply
7XNPImfg008,875600,882560,not getting enough action at all i mean  jesse lingard is a case in point isn't  he he came back from that west ham loan
7XNPImfg008,882560,888320,spell the season before last and his  stock was so high  so high that oligonosulsha effectively
7XNPImfg008,888320,895199,assured him he would be getting first  team football he would form a part of  that squad for the following season
7XNPImfg008,895199,901600,it just didn't happen for him i wonder  what would have happened had there been  a five substitutions rule i'm not saying
7XNPImfg008,901600,907199,that he'd still be at manchester united  but would he have got more game time  than he did last season we might never
7XNPImfg008,907199,913519,know  yeah possibly i mean yeah he made a few  appearances hasn't said it as well but  like you said especially after that loan
7XNPImfg008,913519,918560,spell at west dam it would have been  interesting to see just there's probably  a little bit too many issues behind the
7XNPImfg008,918560,923600,scenes there with that one but you have  mentioned that united are prioritizing  midfield in the transfer window and
7XNPImfg008,923600,929199,another midfield that we have been  linked to is christie and erickson  is it basically just the situation now
7XNPImfg008,929199,934399,where he's deciding between brentford  and united and if you've got any  indication of which way he might go
7XNPImfg008,934399,941199,yeah so one of my colleagues is working  closely on that story and um  they basically said that erickson is
7XNPImfg008,941199,946240,going to choose between brentford and  manchester united the united offer
7XNPImfg008,946240,952720,is financially more lucrative than the  brentford one but i don't think um
7XNPImfg008,952720,958720,erickson's decision will be strictly  motivated on on money i think there are
7XNPImfg008,958720,963839,other issues at play here  on the positive side on the brentford  side
7XNPImfg008,963839,970000,they've had him of course for six months  um erickson was very very thankful to
7XNPImfg008,970000,975839,thomas frank for giving him that  opportunity when perhaps some other  clubs might not have taken the risk and
7XNPImfg008,975839,981839,you know if you ask a lot of brentford  fans had he not joined when he did  some are actually saying they could have
7XNPImfg008,981839,988079,actually gone down so he was quite  pivotal in their in their second half of  that season um
7XNPImfg008,988079,994240,last season on the flip side united yes  as i mentioned financially more  lucrative but also there is a
7XNPImfg008,994240,999759,relationship there between ericsson and  eric tenharg because ericsson when he
7XNPImfg008,999759,1006720,was building up his fitness again after  that horrendous moment when he had that  cardiac arrest at the euros when he was
7XNPImfg008,1006720,1014399,trying to get you know to train at other  clubs he went back to iax  and he trained with the team at iax and
7XNPImfg008,1014399,1020240,eric tenharg was the manager there so i  think that's um can't be underestimated
7XNPImfg008,1020240,1026480,the the relationship that will have been  built up there so i think it is a choice  between those two clubs
7XNPImfg008,1026480,1034480,it will be down to to christian eriksen  but if if united were to get  ericsson and young and maybe and anthony
7XNPImfg008,1034480,1040240,as well and maybe if they were to bring  in another defender i think some of the
7XNPImfg008,1040240,1046640,detractors rather uh over the past few  weeks may just get turned you never know
7XNPImfg008,1046640,1052880,um just just sorry to go backwards a  little bit but you know talking to  defenders he said maybe a defender
7XNPImfg008,1052880,1058240,but do you have  is there any indication of which other  defenders united may be looking at  because i know we mentioned timber and
7XNPImfg008,1058240,1065120,that sort of looks like that that's not  going to happen is there anyone you  think that because we've  we're hearing that there's the kid from
7XNPImfg008,1065120,1071360,uh feyenoord the the left back is it um  who we've been linked with  yeah last year yeah
7XNPImfg008,1071360,1077280,there's one or two others is there  anyone that you've seen that you think  maybe could end up at old trafford  well
7XNPImfg008,1077280,1084080,it's the theme that we've been following  isn't it  from the moment we started this podcast  eric tenharg going for what he knows and
7XNPImfg008,1084080,1090400,what he trusts and there's a definite  interest in lissandro martinez as well
7XNPImfg008,1090400,1097440,from iacs arsenal also very very  interested in him  both clubs in the europa league next
7XNPImfg008,1097440,1103360,season so  it will come down once again to the  player and you just think if united
7XNPImfg008,1103360,1109840,um using the relationship potentially  that eric tenharg has with lisandro  martinez could they be
7XNPImfg008,1109840,1114960,in pole position to try and sign him but  again iax um
7XNPImfg008,1114960,1120160,you know they don't want to lose all of  their players and they don't want to  lose them all to one club as well having
7XNPImfg008,1120160,1127600,said that you've got to remember not  only the link of course eric tenhard and  iax but also the relationship generally
7XNPImfg008,1127600,1134559,that iacs have with manchester united it  is a very very friendly one if you go  back a couple of summers when united
7XNPImfg008,1134559,1140240,signed van der beek how often do you see  a tweet from the selling club
7XNPImfg008,1140240,1147120,wishing the player well and saying that  united is a great club and we hope you  do really really well and i think it was
7XNPImfg008,1147120,1152160,almost the same kind of message that was  sent when ten hogg
7XNPImfg008,1152160,1159120,left iax um as manager of ix to become  the manager of manchester united and i  think one of the key reasons for that is
7XNPImfg008,1159120,1165440,is the iax chief executive a certain  edwin bandazar of course a manchester  united legend and
7XNPImfg008,1165440,1171360,always had a really really good  relationship with manchester united and  i think that has carried on with the
7XNPImfg008,1171360,1176480,clubs and the business that they do so  as much as iacs will not want to sell
7XNPImfg008,1176480,1184080,all of their players and and the players  that we've been talking about that want  to keep hold of the likes of anthony and  the the likes of lisandro martinez and
7XNPImfg008,1184080,1190160,and yuri and timber  if united did come in for them and a  deal could be agreed i'm sure you would
7XNPImfg008,1190160,1196400,see that negotiations would be quite  friendly between the two clubs  yeah we sort of uh we didn't exactly do
7XNPImfg008,1196400,1202640,what what they asked when it came to  looking after uh donnie van de bee did  we  make sure you look after him yeah i mean
7XNPImfg008,1202640,1208559,you you mentioned that  jay i i i think a lot of manchester  united fans are very very intrigued to
7XNPImfg008,1208559,1215840,see what happens now  with donnie van der beek because eric  tenharg is there look donny van der beek
7XNPImfg008,1215840,1222320,was a central part of that team that got  ix to that semi-finals in in the  champions league when they were pipped
7XNPImfg008,1222320,1230240,by tottenham in that remarkable game and  so  van der beek  in with eric tenharg once again if
7XNPImfg008,1230240,1235760,it doesn't work  for donny van der beek under eric ten  hogg
7XNPImfg008,1235760,1241679,then i think  potentially he might not have a future  at united but i mean you would expect
7XNPImfg008,1241679,1247840,given the relationship that they share  and given van der beek knows exactly how  ten hog works and ten hog knows exactly
7XNPImfg008,1247840,1253200,how van der beek works is that old  cliche could it be like a new signing  for united you never know it could be
7XNPImfg008,1253200,1258720,could be diong van der beek and senator  getting a band back together um or even
7XNPImfg008,1258720,1264960,it looks like it could be basically a  quarter of the way there to i excited a  few years ago  yeah you never know hopefully we get the
7XNPImfg008,1264960,1270000,same success they had  now we're gonna um touch on the keepers  now because dean henderson looks like
7XNPImfg008,1270000,1276799,you see me on the way to forest  why do you think united have opted for a  loan rather than a straight-up sale
7XNPImfg008,1276799,1282320,yeah this is an interesting one actually  because the initial noises we were  hearing on that deal was that it was a
7XNPImfg008,1282320,1287440,loan with an option for about 20 million  pounds now that quickly changed to
7XNPImfg008,1287440,1294159,united were just pushing for a loan a  straight loan whereas forests were  pushing for that option understandably
7XNPImfg008,1294159,1300159,because if they  get dean henderson and he performs  really well and say they stay in the  premier league
7XNPImfg008,1300159,1305200,and they've agreed an option price for  an outstanding goalkeeper look
7XNPImfg008,1305200,1310640,and someone who's been capped by england  for 20 million pounds i think there's  only one winner in that situation and
7XNPImfg008,1310640,1316240,that would be forest i think what united  wants to do here  and by the way the status of that deal
7XNPImfg008,1316240,1322400,is that we think that that is now agreed  between the two clubs we think that  henderson will be joining on a
7XNPImfg008,1322400,1330080,season-long loan and a straight loan and  that's all and i think what united's  thinking on this one is is as follows
7XNPImfg008,1330080,1336320,and you can see there's a bit of method  behind this and you can see the  reasoning for it so say
7XNPImfg008,1336320,1343520,they allow dean henderson to go and he  performs unbelievably well and they had  an option for 20 million pounds
7XNPImfg008,1343520,1349600,if dean henderson has a fantastic season  wherever he is and manchester united  choose to sell him next summer
7XNPImfg008,1349600,1355360,he's not going to go for as little as 20  million pounds let's be honest his  market value will have gone up so i
7XNPImfg008,1355360,1360480,think what united want to do is this  send him one loan to forest
7XNPImfg008,1360480,1367280,see how he does at forest  remember only two seasons ago dean  henderson signed a five-year contract at
7XNPImfg008,1367280,1373440,united he's under contract until 2025 so  time is on united side they don't need  to make big decisions about the
7XNPImfg008,1373440,1380080,permanent future of dean henderson  at this moment in time they don't need  to do that so they can afford if they've
7XNPImfg008,1380080,1386240,chosen de gea to be their number one  next season to allow henderson to go and  if they say right you can go on loan for
7XNPImfg008,1386240,1391840,the season and he performs fantastically  well  one of two things can happen when he
7XNPImfg008,1391840,1397919,returns to united in the summer  if they decide right you perform  brilliantly
7XNPImfg008,1397919,1403520,you are going to be our number one next  season still got two years left on his  contract dean henderson will be the
7XNPImfg008,1403520,1408720,manchester united number one goalkeeper  henderson's happy united are happy if
7XNPImfg008,1408720,1415600,he performs well  and  united still decide do you know what
7XNPImfg008,1415600,1422240,we still think de gea is the guy he's  our number one  and we're going to allow you to leave
7XNPImfg008,1422240,1428240,but on a permanent deal  and he's performed well during that  season i think his market value will be
7XNPImfg008,1428240,1434480,more than 20 million pounds so that's  the kind of calculated risk that  manchester united have taken by not
7XNPImfg008,1434480,1440720,allowing an option in that deal there is  the third option  where if he goes to nottingham forest
7XNPImfg008,1440720,1446799,and as an absolute nightmare concedes  loads of goals makes lots of mistakes  nottingham forests get relegated and
7XNPImfg008,1446799,1452720,then he comes back to united and his  market value will not be very high but i  think manchester united will have
7XNPImfg008,1452720,1458640,weighed all of that up and it's almost a  calculated risk which sometimes you have  to take in football and i think united
7XNPImfg008,1458640,1463840,have decided yes they've got faith in  henderson performing well and  maintaining his value when he returns to
7XNPImfg008,1463840,1469679,united either playing at united next  season or getting a big money move next  summer
7XNPImfg008,1469679,1476880,yeah it does kind of make sense to me  he's still very young for a goalkeeper  and we've seen signs he didn't have  obviously he barely played last season
7XNPImfg008,1476880,1482559,but when especially when he was on loan  at sheffield united he had a great  season didn't he so
7XNPImfg008,1482559,1487919,for once i think that kind of makes a  lot of sense uh wasn't it
7XNPImfg008,1487919,1494400,i think the intention was henderson was  going to be the number one choice next  season sorry last season yeah after so
7XNPImfg008,1494400,1500320,the europa league final remember it  finished and  some were even speculating at the time
7XNPImfg008,1500320,1505840,david de gea's last kick as a manchester  united player was a penalty that he had
7XNPImfg008,1505840,1512640,saved and united lost the europa league  final and there was a lot of uh  speculation that that was to be uh david
7XNPImfg008,1512640,1518320,hayes last action in the united shirt  and dean henderson for all the money was  going to be the united number one the
7XNPImfg008,1518320,1524559,following season unfortunately for  henderson he contracted covid just as  the season was going to start and sir
7XNPImfg008,1524559,1530640,david de gea kept his place but not only  did he keep his place he kept henderson  out of the team simply because he
7XNPImfg008,1530640,1536080,performed so well and so the hayer took  that second opportunity that he had and
7XNPImfg008,1536080,1542400,stayed during the rest of the season and  from what i can hear from a lot of  united fans the only two players who
7XNPImfg008,1542400,1547520,kind of escaped any criticism from the  performances last season were de gea and
7XNPImfg008,1547520,1553919,cristiano ronaldo i mean you guys have  watched them a lot more than me  yeah um i think the hail was still a
7XNPImfg008,1553919,1559919,little bit patchy at times i don't think  it was quite a vintage david de gea year  but certainly compared to some of his
7XNPImfg008,1559919,1565120,teammates he was a lot better and  especially as you mentioned he was one  of the best of a bad bunch yeah it was
7XNPImfg008,1565120,1571039,kimoko um i think dean henderson caught  cover dinner at one point and i think  that yeah sort of setting back and i
7XNPImfg008,1571039,1577840,think we're just at the time recording i  think fabricio romano has obviously been  on sky as has tweeted and here we go
7XNPImfg008,1577840,1583120,um dean henderson going safari so that  looks like  it's definitely happening um which you
7XNPImfg008,1583120,1588240,know is exactly what you just said to be  fair so yeah dean anderson there you go  there's a bit of transfer business done
7XNPImfg008,1588240,1594450,hey you know your tv  that'll get us winning titles
7XNPImfg008,1594450,1600960,[Laughter]  as always it's been great chatting to  you um and you know hopefully next time
7XNPImfg008,1600960,1606559,we'll talk we've will have made a few  signings and we'll look forward to  speaking to you again soon as well
7XNPImfg008,1606559,1611679,yeah before you go do i let me ask you  one question  this is to you guys okay september the
7XNPImfg008,1611679,1616720,first  okay united fans are worried at the  moment okay where are these signings why
7XNPImfg008,1616720,1622880,the club not signing anyone come  september the first  if you are to do a podcast and you look
7XNPImfg008,1622880,1629360,back on the transfer window  what would you  view as a successful transfer window for
7XNPImfg008,1629360,1636559,manchester united  you could go first what i'd view as a  would be probably two midfielders
7XNPImfg008,1636559,1643600,i actually was  edging towards a secondary striker  actually rather than a winger right okay
7XNPImfg008,1643600,1648960,and  possibly a fallback but obviously that's  that's a dream case you know that's a
7XNPImfg008,1648960,1654480,dream scenario which probably wouldn't  happen  but i think successful if i'm being  realistic would be
7XNPImfg008,1654480,1659840,two midfielders  and the forward  and the defender which is four
7XNPImfg008,1659840,1665360,do you know what i want to be different  but you've pretty much said what i'm  thinking yeah definitely two midfielders
7XNPImfg008,1665360,1671360,i think one midfielder isn't enough we  need some major surgery there even  without the ones we've lost especially
7XNPImfg008,1671360,1678640,when as you mentioned earlier damage  we've lost pogba and nemanja matic  um so yeah at least two midfielders
7XNPImfg008,1678640,1684880,i'd like to see us have someone on that  right hand side on that right-hand side  of attack i think we could do with  another option there because i think
7XNPImfg008,1684880,1690880,sometimes we're playing the likes of  rashford and langer there who don't play  as well as they do on the left even  sancho i think i'm just better i'm just
7XNPImfg008,1690880,1699279,concerned about the ronaldo being the  owning out number nine at 38. would you  go for it would you want as a striker
7XNPImfg008,1699279,1705600,there's not a whole lot of options out  there but there's there's there's a few  good young players in the likes of  bundesliga don't have the best transit
7XNPImfg008,1705600,1711200,ability in terms of forwards oh  especially the bundesliga um
7XNPImfg008,1711200,1718799,i don't know i like this scamaca from  solo from syria but i know italian  players very rarely like coming here but
7XNPImfg008,1718799,1724559,there's a few young strikers out there  that don't necessarily have to be  threatening ronaldo but it could  actually be a bit of an option to come
7XNPImfg008,1724559,1730799,in and do a bit of a job yeah i mean i'd  be happy to see us giving uh someone  flight you say to rotate but i'm with
7XNPImfg008,1730799,1735919,you i think we need some i think we need  at least one full back and not two  honestly i think our full back position
7XNPImfg008,1735919,1742159,so people forgetting about the fallback  thing terrible last season it's been a  merry-go-round for a reason i think you  know luke shaw didn't quite well he
7XNPImfg008,1742159,1748320,didn't he didn't have uh a very good  season tellers wasn't up sweet the loads  question marks and one basaka his form
7XNPImfg008,1748320,1754559,fell off a cliff so  yeah i'll settle for four as well four  signings so i'll tell you what on the  1st of september we'll speak to you
7XNPImfg008,1754559,1760559,again darmish and we'll see  see where we're at what do you think  would you i'll just put that question  back to you what do you think for united
7XNPImfg008,1760559,1766559,would constitute a good transfer window  i think that i mean to fill those
7XNPImfg008,1766559,1773200,priority positions would probably be  the the number one priority i mean  central midfield i think every united
7XNPImfg008,1773200,1779360,fan you speak to would say that that is  where united need most surgery so and
7XNPImfg008,1779360,1785200,not just quality they need numbers as  well you mentioned the players that have  left along the forward line i mean the
7XNPImfg008,1785200,1790799,information that i've been given there  was all this talk about darwin nunes  wasn't there and i think that united's
7XNPImfg008,1790799,1796559,uh argument against that would have been  yes they want um
7XNPImfg008,1796559,1801760,like improvements along the forward line  but not necessarily a number nine and so
7XNPImfg008,1801760,1809440,as much as mate they might have been  interested i don't think they were  interested at the price that was being  quoted to what would not have been the
7XNPImfg008,1809440,1816080,number one priority position just say  that they bought darwin nunes you're  looking at 80 the thick end of 85
7XNPImfg008,1816080,1822320,million pounds all in  united have got a budget as well  remember they can't just spend 400
7XNPImfg008,1822320,1828240,million pounds in a transfer window so  how much  would darwin nunes have taken off the
7XNPImfg008,1828240,1834559,budget to a priority position would  united fans have accepted  signing darwin nunes
7XNPImfg008,1834559,1840240,but not getting the number one priority  in central midfield it's a balancing act
7XNPImfg008,1840240,1846080,because could they have got nunes and  frankie deyoung and fulfilled other  positions that they wanted to fill
7XNPImfg008,1846080,1852159,difficult  difficult it is difficult we'll have to  wait and see we'll see it sounds like  supporting we'll talk to you again on
7XNPImfg008,1852159,1857360,the 1st of september when we sat here  crying and  [Laughter]  [Music]
7XNPImfg008,1857360,1862960,we haven't signed anyone but we've  managed to get rid of a few more players  on loan um damas it's always a pleasure
7XNPImfg008,1862960,1869039,chatting to you we will chat again soon  thanks for coming on the channel  no problem my pleasure
7XNPImfg008,1869039,1875200,so a big thanks to damash seth from sky  sports for coming on the podcast always  great chatting to him
7XNPImfg008,1875200,1880559,told us a lot of sort of what we we  guessed and what we thought might be  happening as well didn't we but it's  quite interesting especially the los
7XNPImfg008,1880559,1886720,angeles thing there could be a bit of  movement in there yeah definitely i'm  more intrigued to look at where  erickson's going to end up because if it
7XNPImfg008,1886720,1892320,is between united and brentford what  does united fans feel like it should be  an easy option it should be an easy
7XNPImfg008,1892320,1897679,choice especially we can offer him a  more lucrative deal  but the fact that he's kind of mulling
7XNPImfg008,1897679,1902799,over  us and  a relegation candidate side with all due
7XNPImfg008,1902799,1906440,respect to it yeah
7XNPImfg008,1908399,1913679,as well he's settled in london and you  can you know he's got a family he's been  through a lot he's settled those are the
7XNPImfg008,1913679,1918960,sort of things that sometimes you know  take priority over am i a bigger or a
7XNPImfg008,1918960,1924080,better club or whatever anyway we'll see  where we end up we'll see on september  1st whether we have got those four or
7XNPImfg008,1924080,1929919,five signings that me and money were  hoping for or whether it's been  underwhelming this has been the tier one  transfer podcast make sure you're
