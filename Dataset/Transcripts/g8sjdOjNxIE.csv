g8sjdOjNxIE,80,4400,This video is brought to you by Surfshark. Geothermal energy has the potential to be  
g8sjdOjNxIE,4400,7360,an always-on power source for  countries around the world.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,7360,10960,"However, it hasn’t been the hottest renewable  energy option because drilling deep enough into  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,10960,16160,"the earth to reach sufficiently high temperatures  is difficult and costly. Yet, a startup has  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,16160,21920,recently unearthed a solution that might solve  this problem: A heat ray to melt rocks (sort of).  
g8sjdOjNxIE,22640,26080,"I know it sounds like a Star Wars remake, but  we’re not talking about the Death Star here.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,26080,31440,This is actually a well-established nuclear fusion  technology being reapplied to geothermal energy.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,31440,35600,Could it unlock the true potential of geothermal  energy and make it better than solar and wind?  
g8sjdOjNxIE,35600,40640,Let’s see if we can come to a decision on this.  Spoiler: it’s pretty cool … or should I say hot?
g8sjdOjNxIE,41200,43840,I’m Matt Ferrell … welcome to Undecided.
g8sjdOjNxIE,50080,52960,I’m currently in the process of building  a new net zero home and am scoping out  
g8sjdOjNxIE,52960,56320,getting a geothermal heating and  cooling system installed for it.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,56320,60160,The idea of tapping into the earth as a  stable heat source for a heat pump system  
g8sjdOjNxIE,60160,64559,"is really enticing for our homes, but we can  also tap deeper into the earth for a consistent  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,64559,69200,super hot heat source to power turbines to  generate electricity for our cities and towns.
g8sjdOjNxIE,69760,73520,"Unlike solar and wind, geothermal energy  could provide a more stable supply of clean  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,73520,77840,"power while taking up barely any land. On the  other hand, current drilling techniques can’t  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,77840,82320,"affordably reach the hottest spots of the  Earth to unlock that potential. In fact,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,82320,86640,"penetrating deep into hard rock is a tricky  and expensive process. Along with exploration,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,86640,91440,digging wells accounts for 40% of the total  upfront cost of a geothermal plant. That’s  
g8sjdOjNxIE,91440,96000,"why scientists are turning to a death ray …  again, not really … I’ll get to this killer  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,96000,99680,"technology in a minute, but first let’s  have a brief recap on geothermal energy."
g8sjdOjNxIE,99680,104320,"This source of power has been on our planet for  ever. Well, actually inside it. The Earth’s inner  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,104320,108720,"core is about as hot as the sun, which is why  it’s often nicknamed, “the sun beneath our feet”.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,108720,112080,Good news is that it will take billions  of years for the Earth to cool down.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,112080,115920,"Fueled by residual heat from our planet’s  creation and the decay of radioactive elements,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,115920,119520,this underground sun gave rise to  natural hydrothermal reservoirs.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,119520,123920,"Basically, the Earth’s nucleus heat pushes water  up through permeable rocks until it hits a wall,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,124560,129920,"a.k.a. impermeable caprock. Trapped, the water  pressure rises and can sometimes break through.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,129920,135200,Think of Roman baths relying on hot springs. Or  perhaps Icelanders toasting bread over geysers.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,135200,140000,Aside from enabling carbon-free hot baths and  outdoor barbecues we can use subsurface hot steam  
g8sjdOjNxIE,140000,144800,"to drive a turbine and produce electricity. To  do that, you have different plant configurations.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,144800,149120,"Out of all options, binary cycle power plants  are the newest and most sustainable ones.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,149120,153120,"Unlike other designs, binary plants don’t use  the underground hot water to generate steam.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,154000,158560,"To be more specific, after extracting it  and further heating it up to max 400°F (ca.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,159120,164239,"204 C), they run it through a heat exchanger.  Here, the geothermal water transfers its heat  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,164240,168800,to a secondary liquid with a much lower boiling  point. This then generates the steam that will  
g8sjdOjNxIE,168800,173920,spin the turbine. The plant includes a condenser  to convert steam back into a liquid and reuse it.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,173920,178640,"Leveraging this closed-loop binary system, you  won’t boil off the geothermal fluids which, other  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,178640,184000,"than water vapor, contain carbon dioxide, hydrogen  sulfide and other toxic compounds. You can  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,184000,188560,probably see why this is a greener and preferred  alternative to dry and flash steam plants.
g8sjdOjNxIE,188560,193120,"The overall geothermal potential is huge.  According to AltaRock Energy, harvesting only 0.1%  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,194080,199040,of the planet’s heat could satisfy the world’s  energy hunger for 2 million years. Given how  
g8sjdOjNxIE,199040,205599,"cool that is (or hot), why did geothermal energy  account for only 0.55% of our global electricity  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,205600,210880,generation as of 2018? Mainly because the  accessible part of that heat is scattered across  
g8sjdOjNxIE,210880,215840,"the Earth’s crust. In fact, most hydrothermal  reservoirs such as volcano fumaroles, springs  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,215840,220800,"and geysers are only found along tectonic plates.  In addition, the water filling shallow geothermal  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,220800,225520,pockets isn’t hot enough to make energy harvesting  cost-effective. Not to mention the technical and  
g8sjdOjNxIE,225520,229840,"economic hurdles of reaching hotter spots  using current drilling technologies. Yet,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,229840,234319,"thanks to a fusion-inspired drilling technology,  the true potential of geothermal power could be  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,234320,240000,closer than ever. This innovation could get us  below 10 km (ca. 6 miles) in a more cost-effective  
g8sjdOjNxIE,240000,244320,"fashion. Down there, geothermal sources have  much higher temperatures and are more widespread."
g8sjdOjNxIE,244880,248240,"While being cost-effective, the potential of  solar and wind farms is undermined by their  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,248240,253280,"intermittency. Instead, a 24/7 green energy  source like geothermal could give us an extra  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,253280,258480,"powerful weapon against global warming. Speaking  of weapons, let’s dig deeper into how death rays  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,259040,262880,"(again, not a real death ray) could  push geothermal energy to a new level."
g8sjdOjNxIE,262880,267280,"But before I get to that, I’d like to thank  today’s sponsor, Surfshark. I always recommend  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,267280,272160,"using a VPN when using public Wifi, but VPNs  can be very useful even when you’re home.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,272160,275680,A lot of online services use some pretty  sophisticated commercial tracking and machine  
g8sjdOjNxIE,275680,280800,learning to apply very targeted advertising  ... a VPN can protect you from some of that.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,280800,283520,"SurfShark’s CleanWeb does  a great job blocking ads,  "

g8sjdOjNxIE,323120,327600,the channel. Now back to the fusion tech that  could push geothermal energy to a new level.
g8sjdOjNxIE,328160,332320,"It all began with the work of Paul Woskov,  a senior research engineer at MIT’s Plasma  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,332320,337120,"Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). In 2012, he  demonstrated the application of a gyrotron to  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,337120,341840,vaporize rock instead of grinding it. This  high-powered vacuum tube generates a beam  
g8sjdOjNxIE,341840,346080,"of millimeter-long radio-frequency (RF) waves,  which have been used to heat up the plasma and  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,346080,351039,"control its temperature in fusion reactors for  the last 50 years. Hijacking this fusion tech,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,351040,356240,"Woskov envisioned drilling ultra-deep geothermal  boreholes. So, how does that work? You would  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,356240,360960,have a metallic tube embedding the gyrotron  blasting high-frequency electromagnetic waves  
g8sjdOjNxIE,360960,365840,to fuse the underground rock. The system injects  a gas for cleaning up the post-vaporization mess.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,366400,371440,"To be more specific, the gas cools down the  hot vapors, which condense into nanoparticles.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,371440,375040,"These are then flushed out of the well by the  high-pressure stream, but you wouldn’t use this  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,375040,380080,"sophisticated drilling for the entire process. I  reached out to Quaise’s CEO, Carlos Araque, the  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,380080,384960,"on-the-ground…or perhaps underground…arm of this  geothermal revolution, who filled me in on that."
g8sjdOjNxIE,384960,390880,"> “So in geology you have the sedimentary rock and  then below it, you have the basement. Sedimentary  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,390880,395840,"rock it's unconsolidated, it's easy to drill  through. And it's what mechanical drilling systems  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,395840,400160,"are very good at doing, so you drill that first  portion conventionally, no difference there. But  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,400160,406640,"the second portion is very hard to do. So, in that  second portion we use a millimeter wave drill.”"
g8sjdOjNxIE,417040,421200,"Based on his experimental results, Woskov figured  out that millimetric waves would make the drilling  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,421200,425760,"process more cost-efficient. First, you wouldn’t  be limited by temperature and rock hardness. On  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,425760,429440,"top of that, there’s no need to have downhole  mechanical equipment that could get damaged.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,430000,433920,"Thanks to a wavelength about 1,000x longer  than that of a typical infrared laser,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,433920,436080,the millimetric waves sputtered by the gyrotron  
g8sjdOjNxIE,436080,440159,go through the incoming rock nanoparticles  without experiencing significant scattering.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,440160,443200,Which means the beam doesn’t lose much  energy before reaching the target surface.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,443760,448000,"Also, the hot molten rock takes up way more  energy when irradiated by a gyrotron compared  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,448000,453520,to when hit by a standard laser. Overall gyrotrons  are up to 5x more energy efficient than the best  
g8sjdOjNxIE,453520,458560,lower-wavelength laser you can get. But what about  costs? Paul Woskov had some thoughts on that.
g8sjdOjNxIE,458560,467840,> “I did look at the cost of electricity  to vaporize a volume of rock. That's the  
g8sjdOjNxIE,467840,476240,main consumable in direct energy drilling. I made  estimates that for an eight inch diameter hole and  
g8sjdOjNxIE,476240,481440,"about 10 kilometers deep, it would cost something  like a half a million dollars of electricity  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,482000,491360,to vaporize an equivalent volume of granite  of that size and depth. When you look at those  
g8sjdOjNxIE,491360,496639,"depths, the total cost of a mechanical drill  well is somewhere in the order of $30 million.”"
g8sjdOjNxIE,497840,502080,"That’s crazy, right? If that proves out, we’re  talking about saving tens of millions of dollars.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,502080,506479,But there’s another key economic benefit of  using heat rays. When relying on mechanical  
g8sjdOjNxIE,506480,511600,"processes such as rotary technology, you need  a high-density fluid, a.k.a. drilling mud,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,511600,516880,"to counter the surrounding pressure on the well  and prevent it from collapsing. In contrast,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,516880,521440,"millimetric waves don’t require drilling mud, but  how would a gyrotron-drilled hole bear thousands  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,521440,525280,"of atmospheres worth of pressure without  failing? When coming out of the gyrotron,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,525280,530320,some of the waves will hit the hole walls and  create a glassy coating. Apart from sealing any  
g8sjdOjNxIE,530320,534720,"wall cracks, the heating process will increase  the internal pressure, which balances the outer  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,534720,540399,"force. As a result, it will be possible to burrow  deeper yet more stable boreholes without adding  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,540400,544400,"any drilling mud, which is another aspect that  could make the whole process more profitable."
g8sjdOjNxIE,544400,552480,"> “You're making a glass lined hole and that glass  is very strong. And so in effect, we are casing at  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,552480,560880,"the same time that we're drilling the hole, which  is another big expense savings for making a hole.”"
g8sjdOjNxIE,560880,562720,"When factoring in all these extra costs,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,562720,565560,Woskov’s brainchild turns out  to be way more cost-effective.
g8sjdOjNxIE,565560,573520,> “I estimate that it could be maybe 10 times  cheaper than a really deep mechanical drill wall.”
g8sjdOjNxIE,574400,580800,"Aside from being costly, drilling mud doesn’t  work at temperatures like 500°C (932 °F),  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,580800,584160,which is where geothermal energy  production is most efficient.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,584160,585759,Paul had some really nice insights on that.
g8sjdOjNxIE,585760,592640,> “Drilling muds don't function at those  temperatures very well. The weight of the  
g8sjdOjNxIE,592640,597440,column begins to run out the deeper you  go because the density of the mud is never  
g8sjdOjNxIE,598000,604160,close enough to the rock density. So eventually  you can't have enough drilling mud columns  
g8sjdOjNxIE,604160,608800,"balancing the outward pressure. However, with  direct energy drilling in high temperatures,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,608800,612720,"we are always over pressured,  no matter what depth.”"
g8sjdOjNxIE,612720,617040,"To be more specific, this mud-free  drilling system could profitably withstand  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,617040,622399,"pressure-related stresses below 10 km, which  is where geothermal access becomes universal.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,622400,625920,"According to the US Department of Energy  (DOE)’s GeoVision report, leveraging these  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,625920,631600,untapped subterranean heat sources could increase  geothermal-based electricity 26-fold by 2050.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,632160,637440,"In addition to a wider availability, when you  go below 10 km (ca. 6 miles), you’ll find the  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,637440,643200,"so-called Super Hot Rock (SHR) geothermal  resources, with temperatures above 375°C  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,644480,650639,"(707 °F). Under these conditions a geothermal  plant can tap into supercritical water, which  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,650640,655760,is more energy dense than its non-supercritical  counterpart. A well plunging into SHR would  
g8sjdOjNxIE,655760,661120,yield up to 10x more energy than a conventional  enhanced geothermal system (EGS). Based on the  
g8sjdOjNxIE,661120,667040,"technical and economic feasibility study conducted  by AltaRock Energy on the Newberry Volcano site,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,667040,673600,"SHR would reduce geothermal’s Levelized Cost of  Electricity (LCOE) by 50%. On top of that, the  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,673600,679759,company estimated that SHR-based geothermal could  have a lower LCOE than onshore wind or even solar.
g8sjdOjNxIE,679760,680640,## Bringing geothermal energy to the lower level
g8sjdOjNxIE,680640,684320,"Clearly, Woskov’s design holds promise for  bringing our geothermal power supply to a  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,684320,689440,"higher level (or lower depth I guess), which means  our energy grid would become much less reliant on  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,689440,694080,fossil fuels. His fusion-inspired drilling  tech is not just confined to the lab space.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,694080,699680,"Last February, an MIT spin-off, Quaise, raised  $40M to develop this ground-breaking tech.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,699680,703839,They graduated from using a 10-kilowatt  gyrotron to drill a 10-centimeter-deep  
g8sjdOjNxIE,703840,708880,hole in palm-sized stone to using Oak  Ridge lab’s megawatt-sized gyrotron.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,708880,713280,The company bore 3-foot-deep holes into  much larger rocks. Quaise is partnering  
g8sjdOjNxIE,713280,716480,with AltaRock to create their first pilot  project where they’re aiming to drill a  
g8sjdOjNxIE,717040,722480,"3,300-foot-deep hole near the Newberry Volcano,  which was chosen as an ideal testing site.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,722480,726959,"In fact, AltaRock believes this crater could be  one of the largest unused geothermal resources  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,726960,731840,in North America. The presence of a shallow magma  body makes the rock down there much hotter than  
g8sjdOjNxIE,731840,738880,"other places, which is why AltaRock could reach  super hot temperatures (above 400°C or 752 F)  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,738880,744080,at a quarter the depth you would need to dig down  to in other places. It’s a good testing ground.
g8sjdOjNxIE,744080,749280,"Looking ahead, Quaise is planning to build its  first full-scale hybrid drilling rig in 2024.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,749280,753040,"Based on this setup, Quaise would first  use conventional rotary drilling to go  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,753040,756800,"down to the basement rock, which is where  they would activate their gyrotron-powered  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,756800,762720,rock-vaporizing system to reach 20 km (ca. 12  miles) to reach temperatures as high as 500°C  
g8sjdOjNxIE,764000,769920,(932 °F). The company touts that they could  get down to that depth in 100 days using a  
g8sjdOjNxIE,769920,775120,"1-MW gyrotron. Just to give you a sense  of scale, the Kola Superdeep Borehole,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,775120,782960,"the deepest hole ever dug on Earth, went down to  40,230 foot-deep (12.2 km) and took 20 years to  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,782960,788640,complete. I can hear you already. Is 100 days  even possible? Carlos shed some light on this.
g8sjdOjNxIE,788640,796400,"> “When you're five kilometers down in a 10  day window, you may spend 30 hours drilling,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,797120,799839,that's the life of the drill bit  before it needs replacement.”
g8sjdOjNxIE,799840,808480,"> “10 days is 240 hours, so you spend seven  eighths of the time running the pipe in and  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,808480,812240,out of the hole to replace that drill bit.  10 days is a million dollars of break time.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,812800,818160,"We don't talk about drilling a hundred meters per  hour, we talk about drilling a very consistent  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,818800,824080,five meters per hour. It just goes  because there's nothing to replace.” 
g8sjdOjNxIE,824080,825360,"> > “Now, if we can  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,825360,830399,"hit a drilling cost of a thousand dollars per  meter regardless of depth, your LCOs are in the  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,830400,836800,"1 to 3 cents per kilowatt hour, so cost parity  with wind and solar, but firm, and always on.”"
g8sjdOjNxIE,836800,840640,"So, in theory, it sounds like Quaise has  got some chances to achieve their goal.  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,840640,845200,"In practice, we should wait for real-world  tests in the field. Nevertheless, the company  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,845200,850080,has a clear and clever long-term vision. They  aim to retrofit existing fossil fuel plants  
g8sjdOjNxIE,850080,854560,which will eventually be decommissioned during  the low-carbon transition. Making the most out  
g8sjdOjNxIE,854560,859120,"of this ready-to-use infrastructure, they could  simply swap coal or natural gas generated steam  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,859680,863200,with round-the-clock underground  hot vapor to spin the turbines.
g8sjdOjNxIE,863200,866240,"> “Steam can come from the ground, so that idea  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,866880,872400,"gets a lot of traction with power project  developers, because they have these power plants  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,872960,877280,that they're losing their social license to  operate and they're increasingly less in the

g8sjdOjNxIE,882880,888080,the people that are most interested in what we're  trying to propose and trying a pilot with them.”
g8sjdOjNxIE,888080,889440,"A pilot plant sounds exciting,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,889440,892320,but looks like it’ll still take  some time for it to…pick up steam…
g8sjdOjNxIE,892320,895760,"> “We're still more than three, four  years away because we still need to do  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,895760,898080,the technology demonstration  before we even get to that.”
g8sjdOjNxIE,898080,901360,Along their geothermal drilling path  Quaise may encounter some other issues.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,901360,906000,"The deeper you excavate, the more energy you  lose. As it stands, making up for this power  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,906000,910400,"loss means stealing electricity from the grid  or running diesel generators. On the other hand,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,910400,914960,Quaise’s CEO claims that fossil fuels consumed  by their drilling system would be less than 1%  
g8sjdOjNxIE,915680,918560,of the renewable energy generated  by their well over its lifetime.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,919120,923839,But their system needs to account for gas pressure  losses too. That’s because of the friction between  
g8sjdOjNxIE,923840,928640,"the gas and the pipe walls. The further down  the gas travels, the higher its pressure drop,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,928640,932800,the bigger the pump you need to circulate it in  and out of the well. That’s one of the reasons why  
g8sjdOjNxIE,932800,937360,Quaise estimated that 20 km may be the lowest  depth they could get to. Another drawback of  
g8sjdOjNxIE,937360,942000,"ultra-deep digging might be earthquakes. Creating  wells could destabilize geological layers,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,942000,946320,which can trigger seismic activity. This has  cooled down some geothermal enthusiasts in  
g8sjdOjNxIE,946320,950720,different countries after power plants were forced  to close. Carlos had a different take on this.
g8sjdOjNxIE,950720,957759,"> “When you drill for geothermal today, you're  mostly drilling near tectonic boundaries because  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,957760,962960,"that's where the heat is closest to the surface,  so you are very intentionally drilling near  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,963840,967840,problematic zones with very  young and unstable geology.  
g8sjdOjNxIE,968960,974880,"When you have the luxury to go deeper  without an exponential increasing cost,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,975760,981440,you move away from those instabilities. I would  even argue that maybe 95% of the business case for  
g8sjdOjNxIE,981440,985760,our drilling is away from tectonic boundaries.  We're actually trying to make geothermal  
g8sjdOjNxIE,985760,989440,available no matter where you are. And most of  the world is actually not on a tectonic boundary.” 
g8sjdOjNxIE,989440,990560,"> Earthquakes aside,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,990560,994640,Quaise will need to keep an eye on budget. As  reported by the International Renewable Energy  
g8sjdOjNxIE,994640,1000560,"Agency (IRENA) in 2019, setting up a geothermal  plant would cost nearly $4,000/kW. Which is  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,1000560,1005120,"roughly 4x more than what you need to spend for  installing a solar farm. However, as mentioned by  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,1005120,1010400,"Carlos and Paul earlier, gyrotron-powered drilling  could save money compared to a mechanical process."
g8sjdOjNxIE,1011120,1015200,"I don’t know if Quaise’s geothermal approach  is the panacea for our energy transition,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,1015200,1019680,but it should definitely be thrown into the mix.  Relying on multiple clean electricity sources  
g8sjdOjNxIE,1019680,1023720,is the sustainable way forward. Carlos’  view seems to align with mine on this.
g8sjdOjNxIE,1023720,1027280,"> “When I think of renewables, they're  trying to do more with much, much more,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,1027280,1031040,"so I don't think that's sustainable. And  I think everybody forgets that, right?  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,1031040,1035839,"I'm not saying we shouldn't do renewables, I  think we should, but we should not forget that  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,1035839,1039199,"things like this and things  like fusion, they need work  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,1039199,1043839,because they are the ones that can actually  get us to where we need to be as a species.”
g8sjdOjNxIE,1044640,1048160,I’m really excited by the potential of this.  It’s also really cool to see a technology from  
g8sjdOjNxIE,1048160,1052880,fusion research getting reapplied in such a  unique way. The development of fusion-inspired  
g8sjdOjNxIE,1052880,1057440,drilling would let us tap into plenty of  super hot fluids by overcoming geographical  
g8sjdOjNxIE,1057440,1062720,and geological limitations. It could unleash  a perpetual spring of geothermal power for a  
g8sjdOjNxIE,1062720,1067840,"zero-carbon energy-independent world. However,  although heat rays are based on solid tech,  "
g8sjdOjNxIE,1067840,1071919,there are still economic barriers and testing to  go through before reaching an industrial scale.
g8sjdOjNxIE,1071920,1076240,So are you still undecided? Do you think  this could make geothermal energy the future  
g8sjdOjNxIE,1076240,1079760,"of our energy grid? Jump into the comments  and let me know. If you liked this video,  "
