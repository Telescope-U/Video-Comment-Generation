B7m-byNkoHc,0,1772,"- Hello, my doves,"
B7m-byNkoHc,1772,4380,"today we're gonna be talking about something sad,"
B7m-byNkoHc,4380,6700,tragic almost.
B7m-byNkoHc,6700,9750,"I watched this new Netflix show called ""Emily In Paris"","
B7m-byNkoHc,9750,11590,"maybe you've heard of it,"
B7m-byNkoHc,11590,15130,and it was an absolute waste of my time.
B7m-byNkoHc,15130,17630,"Why did I watch the show, you may ask?"
B7m-byNkoHc,17630,20410,"Because I saw that it was created by Darren Star,"
B7m-byNkoHc,20410,23260,"who created ""Sex In the City"" and ""Beverly Hills 90210"""
B7m-byNkoHc,23260,25670,"and the costume design was by Patricia Fields,"
B7m-byNkoHc,25670,29330,"who also did ""Sex In the City"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada""."
B7m-byNkoHc,29330,33684,"But despite these accolades, it was just not great."
B7m-byNkoHc,33684,35260,"- It's definitely not for me, darling."
B7m-byNkoHc,35260,37649,- There's been like a ton of articles already
B7m-byNkoHc,37650,40980,"on why ""Emily In Paris"" is a flop,"
B7m-byNkoHc,40980,44079,especially from the perspective of French critics
B7m-byNkoHc,44080,48940,who accuse the show of being both overly Francophilic.
B7m-byNkoHc,48940,49773,Is that a word?
B7m-byNkoHc,51000,55710,"Fetishizing France as well as being anti-France, as well."
B7m-byNkoHc,55710,58149,And I don't really want to do a review on the actual show
B7m-byNkoHc,58150,60390,because I feel like there's been a ton
B7m-byNkoHc,60390,62790,"of other, better reviews already"
B7m-byNkoHc,62790,65230,that really hit the nail on the head.
B7m-byNkoHc,65230,66440,If you haven't seen my friend
B7m-byNkoHc,66440,69100,"Modern Girls's video on the subject,"
B7m-byNkoHc,69100,72263,she does a great review of the show overall.
B7m-byNkoHc,73530,75740,"But yeah, I've just seen a lot of content about that"
B7m-byNkoHc,75740,76573,and I feel like
B7m-byNkoHc,76573,79700,"I couldn't introduce anything new on that front,"
B7m-byNkoHc,79700,82259,but I will be talking today
B7m-byNkoHc,82260,86020,"about the second most underwhelming thing after the plot,"
B7m-byNkoHc,86020,90929,"which are the outfits, specifically Emily's outfits."
B7m-byNkoHc,90930,93150,"Look, I would not be critiquing the show"
B7m-byNkoHc,93150,97360,if they didn't so obviously try to make waves on that front.
B7m-byNkoHc,97360,101330,There's actually nothing about Emily's character
B7m-byNkoHc,101330,104250,that requires her to be a fashionista.
B7m-byNkoHc,104250,105990,She works at a PR firm.
B7m-byNkoHc,105990,107820,The people who work there are dressed well
B7m-byNkoHc,107820,110610,and they do represent some luxury fashion brands
B7m-byNkoHc,110610,113080,but she also works with other non-fashion brands.
B7m-byNkoHc,113080,115580,"She's not fully integrated into the industry,"
B7m-byNkoHc,115580,117000,you know what I mean?
B7m-byNkoHc,117000,118620,And the thing with costume design
B7m-byNkoHc,118620,121670,is that the clothes don't actually have to look amazing.
B7m-byNkoHc,121670,124500,"The characters don't all have to be super well dressed,"
B7m-byNkoHc,124500,127400,"the clothes just have to reflect who the characters are,"
B7m-byNkoHc,127400,129009,much like how clothes in real life
B7m-byNkoHc,129009,130840,reflect the people who wear them.
B7m-byNkoHc,130840,131940,"But taking that into account,"
B7m-byNkoHc,131940,135520,the clothes that Emily wears literally don't make any sense.
B7m-byNkoHc,135520,138350,Emily literally never talks about clothes.
B7m-byNkoHc,138350,140850,She doesn't seem to follow any designers.
B7m-byNkoHc,140850,143020,She even calls herself basic.
B7m-byNkoHc,143020,145450,- I just came here to apologize for the other day
B7m-byNkoHc,145450,146379,for offending you
B7m-byNkoHc,146380,149863,"and, and to let you know that you're right,"
B7m-byNkoHc,150860,153650,I am a basic bitch with a bag charm.
B7m-byNkoHc,153650,156480,"- Sidebar, I don't think Emily's style is basic at all."
B7m-byNkoHc,156480,158010,I kind of wish it was basic
B7m-byNkoHc,158010,160939,"because then, at least, it wouldn't be such an eyestrain."
B7m-byNkoHc,160940,163720,"When the agency was going after a luxury fashion brand,"
B7m-byNkoHc,163720,165740,"Pierre Cadault, which is fictional,"
B7m-byNkoHc,165740,168730,she was no more interested in him than any other client.
B7m-byNkoHc,168730,170360,She actually had to look him up
B7m-byNkoHc,170360,172130,despite the fact that he's supposed to be
B7m-byNkoHc,172130,174500,one of the biggest designers ever.
B7m-byNkoHc,174500,175930,"So, it doesn't really make sense"
B7m-byNkoHc,175930,177620,"for her to be wearing a decked out wardrobe,"
B7m-byNkoHc,177620,179450,"full of designer clothes, right?"
B7m-byNkoHc,179450,181379,Like she's supposed to be this Midwestern girl
B7m-byNkoHc,181380,183150,who mainly worked with pharmaceutical brands
B7m-byNkoHc,183150,186349,and in the first episode she's wearing Louboutins.
B7m-byNkoHc,186350,188710,If they wanted to go down the fashion route
B7m-byNkoHc,188710,192700,they should have had her express more interest in fashion.
B7m-byNkoHc,192700,195890,"As we know, you don't have to work in the fashion industry"
B7m-byNkoHc,195890,200100,to like fashion or to be stylish
B7m-byNkoHc,200100,203230,but if you clearly show effort in how you dress
B7m-byNkoHc,203230,206400,"and you have a wardrobe of designer clothing,"
B7m-byNkoHc,206400,209980,I'm going to assume that you talk about fashion
B7m-byNkoHc,209980,214629,or at least go shopping more often than the average person
B7m-byNkoHc,214630,217110,who doesn't care about their personal style.
B7m-byNkoHc,217110,218850,"Let's look at Carrie from ""Sex In The City""."
B7m-byNkoHc,218850,219850,In the first season
B7m-byNkoHc,219850,222080,she starts off working as a relationship columnist
B7m-byNkoHc,222080,224950,but she has a shopping addiction and loves fashion.
B7m-byNkoHc,224950,226879,It's not super obvious at the beginning
B7m-byNkoHc,226880,229120,but it's referenced every few episodes
B7m-byNkoHc,229120,230239,so it would make sense
B7m-byNkoHc,230240,232060,that she dresses the way that she does.
B7m-byNkoHc,232060,234180,- [Carrie] Samantha headed back to her office
B7m-byNkoHc,234180,235849,while I decided to investigate
B7m-byNkoHc,235850,237870,this theory I had about shopping
B7m-byNkoHc,237870,240392,as a way to unleash the creative subconscious.
B7m-byNkoHc,242210,243820,I couldn't believe it.
B7m-byNkoHc,243820,246043,It was the turtle wearing Helmut Lang.
B7m-byNkoHc,247320,249010,"- [Miranda] This one's on sale, half off."
B7m-byNkoHc,249010,251170,"- Sweetie, I just spent $395"
B7m-byNkoHc,251170,252990,"on a pair of open-toed Gucci's last week,"
B7m-byNkoHc,252990,254820,this is not the place to be frugal.
B7m-byNkoHc,254820,255653,- [Miranda] All right.
B7m-byNkoHc,255653,257019,- They could have also gone the route
B7m-byNkoHc,257019,260669,where Emily becomes more interested in fashion
B7m-byNkoHc,260670,262040,after moving to Paris
B7m-byNkoHc,262040,264580,and working with luxury fashion brands
B7m-byNkoHc,264580,269060,and then having her wardrobe develop to reflect that.
B7m-byNkoHc,269060,270700,"This is what they did with ""The Devil Wears Prada"""
B7m-byNkoHc,270700,271533,and it worked.
B7m-byNkoHc,271533,273300,"Andy didn't care about the fashion industry,"
B7m-byNkoHc,273300,275889,didn't understand the importance of fashion.
B7m-byNkoHc,275890,278080,"- You think my clothes are hideous, I get it."
B7m-byNkoHc,278080,281289,"But, you know, I'm not going to be in fashion forever"
B7m-byNkoHc,281290,282850,so I don't really see the point
B7m-byNkoHc,282850,284150,of changing everything about myself
B7m-byNkoHc,284150,285310,just because I have this job.
B7m-byNkoHc,285310,287750,- [Mina] And then slowly started taking her work seriously
B7m-byNkoHc,287750,290960,and in that process became more invested in the industry.
B7m-byNkoHc,290960,292400,"But the difference with ""Emily In Paris"""
B7m-byNkoHc,292400,294240,is that Emily's entire problem
B7m-byNkoHc,294240,296340,revolves around Parisians being mean to her
B7m-byNkoHc,296340,298919,and her not being open to the cultural differences.
B7m-byNkoHc,298920,300190,"But as for career development,"
B7m-byNkoHc,300190,302090,she loves working in PR from the beginning.
B7m-byNkoHc,302090,303490,She doesn't find any difficulty
B7m-byNkoHc,303490,305009,in coming up with campaign ideas
B7m-byNkoHc,305010,306610,or getting deals with the new clients.
B7m-byNkoHc,306610,309169,"Most of her problems stem from her relationship with Sylvie,"
B7m-byNkoHc,309170,312040,who is our French Miranda Priestly character.
B7m-byNkoHc,312040,314010,And Sylvia says that her problem with Emily
B7m-byNkoHc,314010,315570,is Emily's lack of polish
B7m-byNkoHc,315570,318760,and her American non-luxury marketing tactics
B7m-byNkoHc,318760,321810,that prioritize inclusivity over exclusivity.
B7m-byNkoHc,321810,325470,"- You come to Paris, you walk into my office,"
B7m-byNkoHc,325470,327820,you don't even bother to learn the language.
B7m-byNkoHc,327820,330060,You treat this city like it's your amusement park
B7m-byNkoHc,330060,335060,"and after a year of food, sex, wine, and maybe some culture"
B7m-byNkoHc,335430,337180,you'll go back from where you came.
B7m-byNkoHc,337180,338500,- [Mina] She scoffs at Emily's clothing
B7m-byNkoHc,338500,340320,but there's no implication whatsoever
B7m-byNkoHc,340320,342970,that she wants to change Emily or work with her.
B7m-byNkoHc,342970,343803,She just wants Emily
B7m-byNkoHc,343803,345520,out of the country as quickly as possible
B7m-byNkoHc,345520,347979,"and honestly, who can blame her?"
B7m-byNkoHc,347980,349880,- Your language is seriously effed up.
B7m-byNkoHc,352770,354720,"- [Mina] I feel like Miranda, by contrast,"
B7m-byNkoHc,354720,358030,never held this long-standing personal grudge against Andy.
B7m-byNkoHc,358030,360130,She doesn't care about the people who work for her
B7m-byNkoHc,360130,362210,as much as she wants things to get done.
B7m-byNkoHc,362210,364930,"Her ordeal is that if Andy can't do it,"
B7m-byNkoHc,364930,366300,then there's a million other girls
B7m-byNkoHc,366300,367913,who would kill to have her job.
B7m-byNkoHc,369250,371260,- Quit. (Andy squeaking)
B7m-byNkoHc,371260,373550,"I can get another girl to take your job in five minutes,"
B7m-byNkoHc,373550,375169,one who really wants it.
B7m-byNkoHc,375170,378440,"- But, I, I, no, I don't want to quit. That's not fair."
B7m-byNkoHc,378440,380920,"- What is it that you want me to say to you, huh?"
B7m-byNkoHc,380920,382400,Do you want me to say poor you?
B7m-byNkoHc,382400,386130,"Miranda's picking on you, poor you, poor Andy? Hmm?"
B7m-byNkoHc,386130,390230,"Wake up six, she's just doing her job."
B7m-byNkoHc,390230,392640,- Andy is then the one who goes through the changes.
B7m-byNkoHc,392640,394410,"She's the one who changes her attitude,"
B7m-byNkoHc,394410,397860,"changes her interest, realizes things, et cetera."
B7m-byNkoHc,397860,401319,Emily doesn't do anything. Emily doesn't realize anything.
B7m-byNkoHc,401320,404250,Emily gets her way all the time.
B7m-byNkoHc,404250,406370,"Everything she suggests is a hit,"
B7m-byNkoHc,406370,408290,it's her coworkers who are all wrong
B7m-byNkoHc,408290,409950,and you come around to her.
B7m-byNkoHc,409950,412300,"In regards to her relationship with Sylvie,"
B7m-byNkoHc,412300,414449,she just continues doing whatever she's doing
B7m-byNkoHc,414450,416330,and Sylvie starts to slowly like her
B7m-byNkoHc,416330,418520,because Emily is good at her job
B7m-byNkoHc,418520,420620,not because she's become more likable.
B7m-byNkoHc,420620,424919,"The show comes off as very self-righteous and US-centric,"
B7m-byNkoHc,424920,428240,even from the characters who are not even American.
B7m-byNkoHc,428240,429310,"- I mean, they can't all be be mean."
B7m-byNkoHc,429310,430760,"- Oh yes, they can."
B7m-byNkoHc,430760,432670,Chinese people are mean behind your back.
B7m-byNkoHc,432670,434760,"French people, mean to your face."
B7m-byNkoHc,434760,435710,"- We, as an audience,"
B7m-byNkoHc,435710,439030,are supposed to side with Emily to a certain extent.
B7m-byNkoHc,439030,440540,"We're supposed to feel bad for her,"
B7m-byNkoHc,440540,442600,we're supposed to agree with her.
B7m-byNkoHc,442600,445610,"The French people that she works with are so mean,"
B7m-byNkoHc,445610,447590,"she's great, or whatever."
B7m-byNkoHc,447590,449600,"I mean, you could make the argument"
B7m-byNkoHc,449600,451110,that Emily is supposed to be
B7m-byNkoHc,451110,454620,"this very annoying, stereotypical American."
B7m-byNkoHc,454620,458370,But if the writers purposely tried to convey that
B7m-byNkoHc,458370,461930,you would think that they would have her grow more
B7m-byNkoHc,461930,463180,over the course of the series
B7m-byNkoHc,463180,465810,so that she reflects on herself
B7m-byNkoHc,465810,468730,"and thinks, oh, maybe I'm wrong."
B7m-byNkoHc,468730,471510,Or maybe this is a cultural thing.
B7m-byNkoHc,471510,476510,Or maybe I have to compromise to get along with everyone
B7m-byNkoHc,476540,479100,and to participate in this culture.
B7m-byNkoHc,479100,480710,"- Look, I want to be part of the solution,"
B7m-byNkoHc,480710,481626,not create problems.
B7m-byNkoHc,481627,485530,- Well then you should listen more and talk less.
B7m-byNkoHc,485530,489580,- I can't really grasp what Emily is supposed to go through
B7m-byNkoHc,489580,490780,over the course of the series
B7m-byNkoHc,490780,492760,in terms of personal development.
B7m-byNkoHc,492760,495430,"She wanted to go to Paris, it wasn't like she had to,"
B7m-byNkoHc,495430,497009,and she wants people to accept her
B7m-byNkoHc,497010,498510,but it's always on her terms.
B7m-byNkoHc,498510,500560,She starts off being good at her job.
B7m-byNkoHc,500560,502540,The only conflicts that she really faces
B7m-byNkoHc,502540,504240,"are relationship based, I guess,"
B7m-byNkoHc,504240,506169,but you would think that in 2020
B7m-byNkoHc,506170,508630,we can have more sustenance in our female-driven shows
B7m-byNkoHc,508630,510900,than just relationship drama.
B7m-byNkoHc,510900,513219,"- How does it happen, that four such smart women"
B7m-byNkoHc,513219,515500,have nothing to talk about but boyfriends.
B7m-byNkoHc,515500,517680,It's like seventh grade with bank accounts.
B7m-byNkoHc,517680,519089,What about us?
B7m-byNkoHc,519090,521159,"What we think, we feel, we know?"
B7m-byNkoHc,521159,524462,"Christ, does it always have to be about them?"
B7m-byNkoHc,525670,528200,"Just, you know, give me a call"
B7m-byNkoHc,528200,530170,when you're ready to talk about something besides men
B7m-byNkoHc,530170,531529,for a change.
B7m-byNkoHc,531530,532770,"- Anyways, this was a tangent."
B7m-byNkoHc,532770,534730,"I just wanted to say that ""The Devil Wears Prada"""
B7m-byNkoHc,534730,538310,made so much more sense in terms of Andy's outfits.
B7m-byNkoHc,538310,539143,"For Emily,"
B7m-byNkoHc,539143,542450,nothing about her wardrobe makes sense for her character.
B7m-byNkoHc,542450,543900,I even tried to determine
B7m-byNkoHc,543900,545620,whether there was a style progression
B7m-byNkoHc,545620,549040,"from the first episode to the last, and there really wasn't."
B7m-byNkoHc,549040,550779,She had maybe one or two good looks
B7m-byNkoHc,550780,553750,"throughout the entire show, but they were at random points,"
B7m-byNkoHc,553750,556860,it wasn't like she just got better at styling herself.
B7m-byNkoHc,556860,557693,"Actually, you know what,"
B7m-byNkoHc,557693,559750,that might make sense for her character?
B7m-byNkoHc,559750,562440,"Emily doesn't change over the course of the series,"
B7m-byNkoHc,562440,564290,so why should her style?
B7m-byNkoHc,564290,567980,Another thing is how is Emily affording any of her clothes?
B7m-byNkoHc,567980,570430,"I don't know too much about Parisian apartment pricing,"
B7m-byNkoHc,570430,571480,but she doesn't seem
B7m-byNkoHc,571480,574295,like she's living in a super deluxe apartment.
B7m-byNkoHc,574295,576125,"- (speaks in French) It means, er,"
B7m-byNkoHc,576125,577890,the room for the housekeeper.
B7m-byNkoHc,577890,581336,The top two floors were typically reserved for the servants.
B7m-byNkoHc,581336,583230,- (scoffs) You heard all that from the bathroom?
B7m-byNkoHc,583230,585230,"- These walls are made of straw and horsehair,"
B7m-byNkoHc,585230,586920,it'd be harder not to listen.
B7m-byNkoHc,586920,588300,- I also looked at the salary
B7m-byNkoHc,588300,590290,of the average marketing manager in Paris
B7m-byNkoHc,590290,592639,"and the salary is €53,000."
B7m-byNkoHc,592640,595690,"Now I don't know Emily's job title, exactly."
B7m-byNkoHc,595690,597940,I know that there are high and low ends
B7m-byNkoHc,597940,600330,"to these salaries, as well,"
B7m-byNkoHc,600330,602400,but I'm just trying to figure out
B7m-byNkoHc,602400,605520,how she can be so young in the industry
B7m-byNkoHc,605520,610520,and still be making money to buy Louboutins and Chanel bags?
B7m-byNkoHc,611540,612639,Because she's also hinted
B7m-byNkoHc,612640,614440,"at coming from a humble background,"
B7m-byNkoHc,614440,617580,I just don't think she has generational wealth either.
B7m-byNkoHc,617580,618800,- Get your dad's lawyers involved.
B7m-byNkoHc,618800,619839,- My dad doesn't have a lawyer.
B7m-byNkoHc,619840,621810,He breeds Weimaraners. - Hmm.
B7m-byNkoHc,621810,623020,- But the only thing we could afford
B7m-byNkoHc,623020,624210,from any of those designers
B7m-byNkoHc,624210,629210,"was a clip on bag charm from a outlet mall in Winnetka, so."
B7m-byNkoHc,629460,630970,"- [Mina] At least in ""The Devil Wears Prada"","
B7m-byNkoHc,630970,632300,Andy gets her designer clothes
B7m-byNkoHc,632300,634120,once her coworker hooks her up.
B7m-byNkoHc,634120,636150,"In ""Sex In The City"" it was kind of obscure"
B7m-byNkoHc,636150,637930,how much money Carrie was making from her job
B7m-byNkoHc,637930,640580,and people did criticize it.
B7m-byNkoHc,640580,642370,But even if relationship columnists
B7m-byNkoHc,642370,643750,"don't actually make that much money,"
B7m-byNkoHc,643750,645960,it just seemed less unbelievable
B7m-byNkoHc,645960,648630,"because Carrie was in her mid-thirties,"
B7m-byNkoHc,648630,650850,she was relatively well known in New York
B7m-byNkoHc,650850,651759,and she was surrounded
B7m-byNkoHc,651760,654810,by established and successful friends.
B7m-byNkoHc,654810,657460,"- Look, I'm not sure you understand,"
B7m-byNkoHc,657460,660090,but I'm kind of somebody
B7m-byNkoHc,660090,662670,and she's definitely kind of somebody.
B7m-byNkoHc,662670,664660,- It's also kind of confusing
B7m-byNkoHc,665560,667029,to ascertain whether or not
B7m-byNkoHc,667030,670210,"Emily is supposed to be dressed badly, objectively,"
B7m-byNkoHc,670210,673310,because she is wearing all this designer
B7m-byNkoHc,673310,675760,but the characters do acknowledge
B7m-byNkoHc,675760,678730,that they don't like what she's wearing.
B7m-byNkoHc,678730,680079,- Any tips on what to wear.
B7m-byNkoHc,681570,682720,- Not that.
B7m-byNkoHc,682720,684360,- I'm not sure if the show
B7m-byNkoHc,684360,686980,is trying to say that French people
B7m-byNkoHc,686980,689199,are boring and singular with their style
B7m-byNkoHc,689200,692220,and Emily is super avant-garde
B7m-byNkoHc,692220,695339,"and experimental in comparison,"
B7m-byNkoHc,695340,697570,or if we're supposed to laugh at Emily
B7m-byNkoHc,697570,698990,and what she's wearing?
B7m-byNkoHc,698990,700339,But regardless of whether
B7m-byNkoHc,700340,703690,"we're supposed to like or dislike Emily's wardrobe,"
B7m-byNkoHc,703690,707070,I feel like the show was more leaning towards
B7m-byNkoHc,707070,710210,"creating these statement, memorable outfits"
B7m-byNkoHc,710210,712520,that would spark a conversation
B7m-byNkoHc,712520,716090,rather than designing a wardrobe that makes sense for Emily.
B7m-byNkoHc,716090,718060,"Take, for instance, the Louboutins."
B7m-byNkoHc,718060,721400,"Emily is an optimistic, workaholic, go-getter."
B7m-byNkoHc,721400,725560,"- But, I enjoy work and accomplishment."
B7m-byNkoHc,725560,727993,"It, it makes me happy."
B7m-byNkoHc,729860,731240,- Work makes you happy?
B7m-byNkoHc,731240,735000,"- Yes, I mean, it's, it's, it's why I'm here, for work."
B7m-byNkoHc,735000,738930,- Yet she walks down cobbled Paris streets in Louboutins.
B7m-byNkoHc,738930,742250,It just doesn't make sense for her to think so pragmatically
B7m-byNkoHc,742250,745120,"and work so efficiently, only to wear clothes"
B7m-byNkoHc,745120,747680,that wouldn't be very convenient for work.
B7m-byNkoHc,747680,750040,The other problem is that if the show
B7m-byNkoHc,750040,753380,"purposely wanted to create these statement looks,"
B7m-byNkoHc,753380,755890,"they failed in that aspect, as well."
B7m-byNkoHc,755890,757970,I feel like the outfits
B7m-byNkoHc,757970,760259,didn't really spark much conversation
B7m-byNkoHc,760260,764810,aside from people like me who analyze all the fashion.
B7m-byNkoHc,764810,767070,But I wouldn't say
B7m-byNkoHc,767070,770420,that the show made any impact on mainstream fashion
B7m-byNkoHc,770420,772630,"like ""Sex In The City"" did, for instance."
B7m-byNkoHc,772630,775370,This is because the show doesn't create anything new.
B7m-byNkoHc,775370,778560,Everything is just a tribute or poorly done version
B7m-byNkoHc,778560,780290,of something that already exists.
B7m-byNkoHc,780290,782440,The final Pierre Cadault show is a tribute
B7m-byNkoHc,782440,785150,to the Viktor & Rolf Spring Summer 2019 collection
B7m-byNkoHc,785150,786620,that got a lot of press.
B7m-byNkoHc,786620,791410,Emily's outfit seemed to be a knockoff Blair Waldorf outfit.
B7m-byNkoHc,791410,794160,"She even admits to being obsessed with ""Gossip Girl""."
B7m-byNkoHc,794160,797459,- Do you wanna know why I got that bag charm?
B7m-byNkoHc,797460,800330,"Because my friends and I were obsessed with ""Gossip Girl"","
B7m-byNkoHc,800330,802990,we all wanted to be Serena van der Woodsen.
B7m-byNkoHc,802990,805980,- And I don't know if it's supposed to be relatable
B7m-byNkoHc,805980,810029,in the sense that Gen Z and Millennial audiences
B7m-byNkoHc,810030,814650,"now tend to get inspiration, style inspiration,"
B7m-byNkoHc,814650,817630,"from influencers, celebrities, and TV shows."
B7m-byNkoHc,817630,819830,"But in the end, it's not very relatable"
B7m-byNkoHc,819830,824390,"because, once again, she's wearing super expensive clothing."
B7m-byNkoHc,824390,828040,"Speaking as a Millennial/Gen Z-er,"
B7m-byNkoHc,828040,831100,"if I wasn't into vintage shopping,"
B7m-byNkoHc,831100,835652,where would I find an affordable Blair Waldorf-esq cord set?
B7m-byNkoHc,836550,838580,urban outfitters.com?
B7m-byNkoHc,838580,840450,We could cut the show some slack
B7m-byNkoHc,840450,842980,"and say, oh, it's more of a social commentary"
B7m-byNkoHc,842980,844230,than anything else.
B7m-byNkoHc,844230,845779,Like Emily being an influencer
B7m-byNkoHc,845780,847480,and going to these influencer events
B7m-byNkoHc,847480,849639,"filled with vapid, self-serving people."
B7m-byNkoHc,849640,851380,The whole phenomenon of streetwear
B7m-byNkoHc,851380,853550,"collaborating with established, high fashion brands"
B7m-byNkoHc,853550,855399,"was clearly referenced, as well."
B7m-byNkoHc,855400,858220,"But, again, nothing in ""Emily In Paris"" is fully baked,"
B7m-byNkoHc,858220,860279,it's all very surface level.
B7m-byNkoHc,860280,861690,Even the way she gains followers
B7m-byNkoHc,861690,864620,"just isn't reflective of the Instagram landscape these days,"
B7m-byNkoHc,864620,867770,"maybe in 2012 it was, but not today."
B7m-byNkoHc,867770,869900,And I just think it's a weird
B7m-byNkoHc,869900,873300,"that the show takes this anti-influencer stance,"
B7m-byNkoHc,873300,875959,even though they made their main character an influencer.
B7m-byNkoHc,875960,877300,I guess this is a rewrite
B7m-byNkoHc,877300,880330,"of the Not Other Girl's annoying tagline,"
B7m-byNkoHc,880330,882970,now is just not like other influencers.
B7m-byNkoHc,882970,886180,They also had the opportunity to talk about exploitation
B7m-byNkoHc,886180,888399,from the influencer point of view
B7m-byNkoHc,888400,890960,and they just completely glossed over it.
B7m-byNkoHc,890960,893450,"You can say what you want to say about influencers,"
B7m-byNkoHc,893450,895340,"I'm sure it's warranted most of the time,"
B7m-byNkoHc,895340,897550,but it was a missed opportunity
B7m-byNkoHc,897550,899290,to gloss over the fact that many companies
B7m-byNkoHc,899290,901610,exploit young people for free advertising.
B7m-byNkoHc,901610,904540,Emily just provides free advertising at this PR event
B7m-byNkoHc,904540,906680,"and the only critique comes from Sylvie,"
B7m-byNkoHc,906680,909960,who says it's a conflict of interest for their clients.
B7m-byNkoHc,909960,910793,"Well, that aside,"
B7m-byNkoHc,910793,912770,if they were trying to make the show representative
B7m-byNkoHc,912770,915910,"or even a satire of today's fashion,"
B7m-byNkoHc,915910,916810,they should have;
B7m-byNkoHc,916810,920710,"1, integrated better and more relevant social commentary"
B7m-byNkoHc,920710,925250,"to show that Emily is a reflection of today's society,"
B7m-byNkoHc,925250,929160,"and, 2, they should have just had her wear clothes"
B7m-byNkoHc,929160,932120,that actually appeal to millennials
B7m-byNkoHc,933000,935670,not these crazy outfits that no one wears.
B7m-byNkoHc,935670,936620,"From my understanding,"
B7m-byNkoHc,936620,939330,Emily was supposed to be a relatable character.
B7m-byNkoHc,939330,941680,"She's not like the cool Instagram girls,"
B7m-byNkoHc,941680,943890,she becomes popular online out of chance
B7m-byNkoHc,943890,945980,"and she's just trying to figure herself out,"
B7m-byNkoHc,945980,948699,make new friends like the rest of us millennials.
B7m-byNkoHc,948700,951840,"It was really a wasted opportunity, in my opinion."
B7m-byNkoHc,951840,953760,"The magic of the fashion in ""Sex And The City"""
B7m-byNkoHc,953760,955750,is how groundbreaking and fresh the outfits were
B7m-byNkoHc,955750,956590,while still keeping up
B7m-byNkoHc,956590,958840,with the silhouettes and the accessorizing
B7m-byNkoHc,958840,961800,popular in the late 90's/ early 2000's.
B7m-byNkoHc,961800,963820,"Also, Carrie's style is very cohesive."
B7m-byNkoHc,963820,964860,Her Fendi Baguette bag
B7m-byNkoHc,964860,966769,"was a huge trend of the time, for instance,"
B7m-byNkoHc,966770,969150,because it was a signature look in the show.
B7m-byNkoHc,969150,971300,"Emily has no signature look in the show,"
B7m-byNkoHc,971300,973000,it's all very random.
B7m-byNkoHc,973000,976190,"The mismatched patterns, the occasional streetwear elements,"
B7m-byNkoHc,976190,979160,the random Audrey Hepburn tribute.
B7m-byNkoHc,979160,980649,What is going on?
B7m-byNkoHc,980650,982530,Her style is just not cohesive.
B7m-byNkoHc,982530,984680,It's like she's overwhelmed
B7m-byNkoHc,984680,987470,by everything that the algorithm pushes towards her
B7m-byNkoHc,987470,989459,and she just buys everything.
B7m-byNkoHc,989460,991430,"I mean, let's take a quick look at some of the outfits."
B7m-byNkoHc,991430,993510,I don't want to comment on every single one
B7m-byNkoHc,993510,996660,because a lot of the problems I have
B7m-byNkoHc,996660,998850,cover the majority of them.
B7m-byNkoHc,998850,1000560,"For instance, as I said before,"
B7m-byNkoHc,1000560,1002610,the insane pattern mismatching.
B7m-byNkoHc,1002610,1004529,I'm not saying it can't be done tastefully
B7m-byNkoHc,1004530,1007090,but it's just overwhelming in Emily's case.
B7m-byNkoHc,1007090,1009950,The colors are either slightly off that they clash.
B7m-byNkoHc,1009950,1011840,Often there are too many colors in one outfit
B7m-byNkoHc,1011840,1015530,that it just looks chaotic and not in the avant-garde way.
B7m-byNkoHc,1015530,1018360,Another major trend for her is her hats.
B7m-byNkoHc,1018360,1019193,"Let's be honest,"
B7m-byNkoHc,1019193,1020830,it's mainly our hats that de-elevate the look
B7m-byNkoHc,1020830,1024770,"from, okay, not great, to did she get dressed in the dark?"
B7m-byNkoHc,1024770,1027470,"At the end of the day, if Emily was a different character,"
B7m-byNkoHc,1027470,1029030,this wardrobe would make sense.
B7m-byNkoHc,1029030,1030439,Some people have compared her outfits
B7m-byNkoHc,1030439,1032779,"to Harper from ""Wizards of Waverly Place"""
B7m-byNkoHc,1032780,1034699,and Harper is chaotically dressed
B7m-byNkoHc,1034699,1036500,but it makes sense for her character.
B7m-byNkoHc,1036500,1038199,She's a chaotic character.
B7m-byNkoHc,1038199,1040279,Emily seems to always have everything together
B7m-byNkoHc,1040280,1041730,"and when things don't go her way,"
B7m-byNkoHc,1041730,1043809,she is unrealistically chill.
B7m-byNkoHc,1043810,1045770,"She's just very neutral about everything,"
B7m-byNkoHc,1045770,1049240,"so a muted, toned-down business professional wardrobe"
B7m-byNkoHc,1049240,1052270,would make so much more sense for her character.
B7m-byNkoHc,1052270,1054530,"Anyway, I didn't figure out a way"
B7m-byNkoHc,1054530,1058715,"to properly segue to the end, but this is the end"
B7m-byNkoHc,1058715,1062400,and rant finally over.
B7m-byNkoHc,1062400,1065450,"I do adore Patricia Fields work in general,"
B7m-byNkoHc,1065450,1066460,"don't get me wrong,"
B7m-byNkoHc,1066460,1070120,I just was super underwhelmed and honestly disappointed
B7m-byNkoHc,1070120,1073240,"by what ""Emily In Paris"" produced."
B7m-byNkoHc,1073240,1075960,Let me know in the comments if you agree or disagree
B7m-byNkoHc,1075960,1079263,and I'll see you in my future video.
