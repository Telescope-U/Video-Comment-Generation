k5J1JzbMqAE,14000,16000,"Assalam-u-alaikum, I'm Zia Tabarak."
k5J1JzbMqAE,16100,19000,"And you might've understood that I'm right now at Chaar Minar Chowrangi, Bahadurabad."
k5J1JzbMqAE,19100,24000,And Bahadurabad's food street is getting really great.
k5J1JzbMqAE,24100,29000,"If there's any food street after Burns Road and Hussianabad, it's this one."
k5J1JzbMqAE,29100,34000,Because all the new flavors and tastes are coming to this location.
k5J1JzbMqAE,34100,36000,This food street is located right in the center of the city.
k5J1JzbMqAE,36100,40000,And we're here to explore something new today as well. First we will…
k5J1JzbMqAE,40100,44000,Try some traditional gol gappay and chaat.
k5J1JzbMqAE,44100,47000,"And after that, there's a new restaurant that has opened called Al-Baghdadi."
k5J1JzbMqAE,47100,50000,I've heard that their chicken shawaya is really good.
k5J1JzbMqAE,50100,56000,It's middle-eastern cuisine and their shawarma fries are also pretty good.
k5J1JzbMqAE,56100,61000,So we'll see that and check what's going on on this food street and share it with you!
k5J1JzbMqAE,61100,63000,So let's go (chalain)!
k5J1JzbMqAE,70100,74000,Whenever I come to Bahadurabad I always come here to have this chaat and gol gappay.
k5J1JzbMqAE,74100,76000,This is a really old shop at Bahadurabad.
k5J1JzbMqAE,76100,79000,And they have really fresh items.
k5J1JzbMqAE,79100,83000,"And we'll especially try the gol gappay, as traditional street food."
k5J1JzbMqAE,83100,87000,"To me, gol gappay are at the top of that list."
k5J1JzbMqAE,100000,101000,How are you?
k5J1JzbMqAE,103000,105000,"Alhamdulillah, you?"
k5J1JzbMqAE,105100,107000,"Alhamdulillah, is the shop shifting?"
k5J1JzbMqAE,107100,108000,Yes.
k5J1JzbMqAE,108100,109000,Where?
k5J1JzbMqAE,109100,113000,Across the street.
k5J1JzbMqAE,115000,116000,How much is one plate now?
k5J1JzbMqAE,116100,119000,140/.
k5J1JzbMqAE,119100,120000,Things are getting really expensive.
k5J1JzbMqAE,120100,124000,What can we do? Oil's expensive and we need oil.
k5J1JzbMqAE,124100,125000,Yeah.
k5J1JzbMqAE,125100,128000,This is our sonth water.
k5J1JzbMqAE,129100,130000,Sonth water?
k5J1JzbMqAE,131000,132000,It'll help with digestion?
k5J1JzbMqAE,132100,133000,Yes.
k5J1JzbMqAE,134000,136000,Check this.
k5J1JzbMqAE,139000,140000,Bismillah.
k5J1JzbMqAE,151000,153000,"I've had it after a long time! Pure date chutney, yogurt."
k5J1JzbMqAE,153100,156000,And chanay inside.
k5J1JzbMqAE,156100,157000,And this sonth water.
k5J1JzbMqAE,167000,169000,Let's go to Al-Baghdadi.
k5J1JzbMqAE,180000,183000,This is a nice small cafe.
k5J1JzbMqAE,183100,186000,With a nice seating arrangement and beautiful lamps.
k5J1JzbMqAE,186100,188000,"When did Al-Baghdadi start, Umar?"
k5J1JzbMqAE,188100,191000,We started it three months ago.
k5J1JzbMqAE,192100,196000,In our menu our main speciality is the shawaya chicken.
k5J1JzbMqAE,196100,199000,"Shawaya is basically a rotisserie chicken, a middle-eastern cuisine."
k5J1JzbMqAE,199100,202000,"That matches with the name ""Al-Baghdadi""."
k5J1JzbMqAE,202100,203000,And it's not available anywhere else in Karachi?
k5J1JzbMqAE,203100,205000,"No, it's not available anywhere else in Karachi."
k5J1JzbMqAE,205100,208000,So is it authentic Arabic flavor?
k5J1JzbMqAE,208100,211000,This is a fusion of desi + Arabic.
k5J1JzbMqAE,211100,213000,And what else do you have except for the shawaya?
k5J1JzbMqAE,213100,217000,"We have momos, platters, shawarma fries."
k5J1JzbMqAE,217100,222000,Like 4-5 types of shawarma and falafels as well.
k5J1JzbMqAE,226000,230000,"I'm seeing a lot of activity in the kitchen, assalam-u-alaikum!"
k5J1JzbMqAE,231000,232000,How are you?
k5J1JzbMqAE,233000,234000,What's your name?
k5J1JzbMqAE,234100,235000,Raees Gill.
k5J1JzbMqAE,235100,236000,Raees Gill?
k5J1JzbMqAE,237000,238000,What are you making Raees?
k5J1JzbMqAE,238000,239000,Shawarma fries.
k5J1JzbMqAE,240000,241000,Shawarma fries?
k5J1JzbMqAE,243000,244000,Very nice.
k5J1JzbMqAE,245000,247000,And what's being made here?
k5J1JzbMqAE,249000,251000,SGKP special noodles.
k5J1JzbMqAE,251100,252000,Okay.
k5J1JzbMqAE,259000,261000,What's your best thing?
k5J1JzbMqAE,261100,263000,Though everything that we have is good.
k5J1JzbMqAE,263100,265000,"But we have introduced something new, shawaya."
k5J1JzbMqAE,265100,266000,Shawaya.
k5J1JzbMqAE,267000,270000,It's basically an Arab dish.
k5J1JzbMqAE,270100,271000,Yeah.
k5J1JzbMqAE,271100,272000,Whole chicken that's roasted.
k5J1JzbMqAE,272100,275000,We're presenting it in a new style.
k5J1JzbMqAE,276000,279000,Does it have any special spices or what?
k5J1JzbMqAE,279100,282000,Our marinade is homemade.
k5J1JzbMqAE,283000,286000,It will stay this way for six hours.
k5J1JzbMqAE,286100,287000,Six hours?
k5J1JzbMqAE,288000,289000,Yes sir.
k5J1JzbMqAE,289100,291000,To properly absorb the flavor.
k5J1JzbMqAE,291100,294000,"Good man, this chicken has the skin on it."
k5J1JzbMqAE,296000,297000,And there are no cuts in it?
k5J1JzbMqAE,297100,298000,No sir.
k5J1JzbMqAE,298100,300000,So all of this marinade…
k5J1JzbMqAE,300100,302000,It goes all the way in.
k5J1JzbMqAE,302100,306000,"Okay, it gets marinated all the way in."
k5J1JzbMqAE,306100,307000,Good man.
k5J1JzbMqAE,307100,316000,"We have special sauces with this, a homemade garlic sauce, and a chilli chipotle sauce too."
k5J1JzbMqAE,320000,324000,"There are many ingredients here, I can see olive oil as well."
k5J1JzbMqAE,324100,329000,Which is a special part of middle-eastern cuisine. Olive oil.
k5J1JzbMqAE,329000,332000,This breast piece goes into the shawarma fries.
k5J1JzbMqAE,340000,342000,So these are our shawarma fries.
k5J1JzbMqAE,345000,348000,This chicken will go in the fries that was just fried.
k5J1JzbMqAE,348100,352000,"Pickled cabbage, those are pickled too."
k5J1JzbMqAE,377000,378000,Chicken's being taken out.
k5J1JzbMqAE,390000,393000,That's half a chicken in the platter.
k5J1JzbMqAE,395000,396000,And the platter is ready.
k5J1JzbMqAE,409000,414000,"I'll definitely have two things, the shawarma fries and we're here for the shawaya anyway."
k5J1JzbMqAE,414100,416000,What's the price of the shawarma fries?
k5J1JzbMqAE,416100,417000,250/.
k5J1JzbMqAE,417100,420000,250? And the shawaya?
k5J1JzbMqAE,420100,422000,Half a shawaya is 1200/.
k5J1JzbMqAE,422100,424000,A half-chicken platter is of 1200/.
k5J1JzbMqAE,424100,426000,And shawarma fries of 250/!
k5J1JzbMqAE,427100,428000,We've got to try these two!
k5J1JzbMqAE,436000,437000,So our awesome platter is here.
k5J1JzbMqAE,437100,441000,That's the platter and these are the fries.
k5J1JzbMqAE,441100,446000,"It has half a chicken, bread and fries."
k5J1JzbMqAE,446100,450000,Hummus and two different sauces.
k5J1JzbMqAE,450100,453000,"And some pickles, shawarma pickles that are middle-eastern."
k5J1JzbMqAE,453100,457000,These fries look great.
k5J1JzbMqAE,457100,463000,Pizza fries used to be a trend in Karachi and I think shawarma fries will be the new trend.
k5J1JzbMqAE,463100,465000,It has really good chicken.
k5J1JzbMqAE,466000,469000,They have slices of chicken breast.
k5J1JzbMqAE,469100,471000,As well as sauces and shawarma pickles.
k5J1JzbMqAE,471100,475000,"And this is a new and different item, shawarma fries."
k5J1JzbMqAE,475100,478000,"Let's taste it, bismillah-irrahman-irraheem."
k5J1JzbMqAE,485000,486000,Wow.
k5J1JzbMqAE,488000,491000,"Too good man, they had fried the chicken really good."
k5J1JzbMqAE,491100,495000,"There's hummus on it, and different sauces too."
k5J1JzbMqAE,495100,501000,And with the sour pickles of the shawarma and with the sauces.
k5J1JzbMqAE,501100,504000,It's giving a really amazing flavor.
k5J1JzbMqAE,504100,508000,This bowl of shawarma fries itself is too big.
k5J1JzbMqAE,508100,512000,That you'll be full even if you just eat the bowl.
k5J1JzbMqAE,512099,513000,Excellent.
k5J1JzbMqAE,517000,521000,"This is our main item, for which we have come to Al-Baghdadi."
k5J1JzbMqAE,521099,522000,Chicken shawaya.
k5J1JzbMqAE,523000,524000,And just look at this.
k5J1JzbMqAE,531000,532000,"Let's taste the chicken shawaya, bismillah."
k5J1JzbMqAE,540000,545000,The chicken skin on it has given it an amazing taste and texture.
k5J1JzbMqAE,545100,548000,Incredibly juicy chicken and I haven't tried it yet with some sauce.
k5J1JzbMqAE,548100,553000,But the chicken itself is very delicious.
k5J1JzbMqAE,553100,557000,You can taste the marinade all the way through.
k5J1JzbMqAE,557100,563000,"And not just on the surface of it, but it's all the way in."
k5J1JzbMqAE,565000,568000,I've dipped the spicy sauce right now.
k5J1JzbMqAE,568100,570000,We have garlic sauce as well.
k5J1JzbMqAE,570100,575000,Rotisserie chicken is made elsewhere in Karachi too like Burns Road and Hussianabad.
k5J1JzbMqAE,575100,581000,"But this shawaya, I don't think I've tasted it anywhere else."
k5J1JzbMqAE,581100,584000,Arabic dishes are at other places too.
k5J1JzbMqAE,584100,588000,But this chicken shawaya is a bit different.
k5J1JzbMqAE,588100,593000,"This chicken shawaya is in two flavors, spicy and non-spicy."
k5J1JzbMqAE,593100,597000,I had ordered the non-spicy which is closer to the authentic taste.
k5J1JzbMqAE,597100,603000,But if you want more spicy than the spicy version is available as well.
k5J1JzbMqAE,603100,604000,The platter's price is 1200/.
k5J1JzbMqAE,604100,610000,The shawarma fries were of 250/ that I especially liked.
k5J1JzbMqAE,610100,617000,And come to Al-Baghdadi and try this platter! Solid!
k5J1JzbMqAE,622000,623000,We're trying the shawaya.
k5J1JzbMqAE,623100,624000,It's good and very different.
k5J1JzbMqAE,624100,625000,Okay.
k5J1JzbMqAE,625100,629000,"It's definitely worth coming to try, it's a whole platter."
k5J1JzbMqAE,629100,633000,It has quite a different taste and is quite authentic.
k5J1JzbMqAE,633100,639000,And it's a fusion of middle-eastern and Pakistani cuisine.
k5J1JzbMqAE,639100,642000,It's definitely worth to try.
k5J1JzbMqAE,642100,643000,Definitely worth to try.
k5J1JzbMqAE,643100,649000,"We heard it from some places and we came to try, and it's really good!"
k5J1JzbMqAE,650000,651000,I liked the shawarma fries actually.
k5J1JzbMqAE,651100,657000,The chicken is really yummy and is very different from other fries.
k5J1JzbMqAE,678000,679000,Is this the 160/ one?
k5J1JzbMqAE,679100,680000,Yes it is.
k5J1JzbMqAE,681000,682000,This is the roohafza flavor.
k5J1JzbMqAE,682100,683000,This is the pakola flavor.
k5J1JzbMqAE,683100,684000,Pakola.
k5J1JzbMqAE,685000,686000,This is pineapple.
k5J1JzbMqAE,686100,688000,Pineapple.
k5J1JzbMqAE,689000,690000,Orange.
k5J1JzbMqAE,691000,692000,Chocolate.
k5J1JzbMqAE,692100,693000,Cherry.
k5J1JzbMqAE,694000,695000,That's a pineapple?
k5J1JzbMqAE,697000,698000,And this is comelle.
k5J1JzbMqAE,705000,706000,Is it ready?
k5J1JzbMqAE,706100,707000,Yes.
k5J1JzbMqAE,707100,708000,Wow.
k5J1JzbMqAE,715100,720000,"After having that yummy shawaya and those fries, we are here to have some limca."
k5J1JzbMqAE,720100,723000,Because to come here and not have limca just can't happen!
k5J1JzbMqAE,723100,729000,"Because we've had some really heavy food, so our lemon limca is also ready."
k5J1JzbMqAE,729100,730000,Very good.
k5J1JzbMqAE,735000,736000,Solid.
k5J1JzbMqAE,736100,741000,"In this heat, limca really feels refreshing  when it goes down."
k5J1JzbMqAE,741100,746000,"Hope you liked today's video, go to Al-Baghdadi and try the shawaya."
k5J1JzbMqAE,746100,749000,"And the fries, hope you'll like it."
k5J1JzbMqAE,749100,753000,Like and share today's video if you liked it.
k5J1JzbMqAE,753100,757000,"See you in the next video, take care, Allah Hafiz."
