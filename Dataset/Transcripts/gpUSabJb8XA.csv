gpUSabJb8XA,333,6906,"Joe: From Wendy's to Quiznos,  we wanted to find out all the biggest  portion-size differences between UK and US fast food."
gpUSabJb8XA,6906,8575,"This is ""Food Wars."""
gpUSabJb8XA,12245,17817,"In the UK, Wendy's iconic Frostys come in three sizes.  Junior, regular, and large."
gpUSabJb8XA,17817,23623,"In the US, we actually have four Frosty sizes.  Junior, small, medium, large."
gpUSabJb8XA,24891,28094,We're going to pour out the largest Frosty  to see how big it is compared to the US's.
gpUSabJb8XA,30430,37971,"The classic hamburger at a Wendy's is called a Dave's,  named after the founder, Dave Thomas.  Ours come in singles, doubles, and triples."
gpUSabJb8XA,37971,44344,"Our burgers are the same in the UK.  They also come as singles, doubles, or triples.  Joe: Now we're going to weigh a US triple."
gpUSabJb8XA,44344,49382,"Pretty close. 14 ounces for our triple.  Now, while a triple might be the official limit"
gpUSabJb8XA,49382,55087,"on burger sizes at Wendy's, Wendy's enthusiasts  have come up with something called a meat cube.  This is a secret menu item"
gpUSabJb8XA,55088,61161,"where you actually take an extra meat patty  and add it to this, so you get four patties,  which I think adds up to around a pound."
gpUSabJb8XA,61161,66366,"Joe, I'm officially challenging you to a meat cube showdown.  The fastest person to eat the entire meat cube wins."
gpUSabJb8XA,66366,69102,"You think you got it?  I accept your challenge, Harry."
gpUSabJb8XA,73039,77744,"Let's do this!  Harry: Three, two, one. Joe: And start."
gpUSabJb8XA,79379,80213,All right.
gpUSabJb8XA,88588,94093,It's a lot of beef.  I see why the triple is the limit now.  Time?  Conner: 1:07.
gpUSabJb8XA,94094,100033,I wish I had more time to chew it.  [coughing]
gpUSabJb8XA,102735,105772,Need the sauce. Need some moisture.
gpUSabJb8XA,108942,113479,"The buns!  Oh, God."
gpUSabJb8XA,115081,120153,[Joe yelling]  How'd I do?  Done.
gpUSabJb8XA,122622,128261,"Yeah!  Whoo!  USA, baby!  Conner: How do you feel?"
gpUSabJb8XA,128261,133733,"Terrible. I feel absolutely terrible.  And yet, elated that I won."
gpUSabJb8XA,133733,139571,"Well, now we know why the US has such an obesity problem.  OK, that's quite enough of that."
gpUSabJb8XA,139572,146446,"Back to our regularly scheduled programming.  [beep]  Another iconic Wendy's menu item is the Baconator.  In the UK, these just come in one size, as a regular."
gpUSabJb8XA,146446,153153,"Of course, in the US, we also have the Baconator,  but we have a smaller Baconator,  known as the Son of Baconator."
gpUSabJb8XA,153153,161261,Something incredibly unsettling  about a burger having a child that's also a burger.  This Baconator giving birth to that Baconator.
gpUSabJb8XA,161261,167767,"Harry: And, of course, we're going to weigh the regular  Baconators to see whose is bigger.  The highly regarded  Wendy's nuggets that come in regular or spicy."
gpUSabJb8XA,167767,173072,"Love the spicy.  They come in units of four, six, and 10."
gpUSabJb8XA,173072,176409,"Nuggets in the UK only come in two portion sizes,  four and eight."
gpUSabJb8XA,178578,185451,"Wendy's, of course, has fries.  And those fries in the US come in four sizes.  Junior, small, medium, large."
gpUSabJb8XA,185451,191691,"Our fries also come in four sizes.  Value, small, medium, and large.  Let's weigh our large fries to see who's getting more."
gpUSabJb8XA,193326,199431,Ours is way less.  Hm. What's that all about?
gpUSabJb8XA,199432,204971,"[beep]  Another side that is probably unique to Wendy's,  I can't think of any other fast-food place that does this,"
gpUSabJb8XA,204971,211244,is Wendy's chili. It has been on the menu  since it opened back in 1969.
gpUSabJb8XA,211244,218151,"In the US, you can get your chili,  ugh, for whatever reason,  in two sizes, small and large."
gpUSabJb8XA,218151,223856,"In the UK, we only have one size of chili,  which is this one. We're going to weight it  against the largest size in the US to find the difference."
gpUSabJb8XA,223856,228995,"Finally, let's compare drinks.  In the US, you can get three sizes of drink.  Small, medium, and large."
gpUSabJb8XA,228995,234467,"On the internet, it does not specify  how much fluid ounces are in any of these."
gpUSabJb8XA,234467,240039,"If I had to guess,  too much, way too much,  way, way too much.  In the UK, drinks come in three sizes."
gpUSabJb8XA,240039,246112,"Small, medium, or large.  And these are advertised as being  12, 16, and 20 ounces, respectively."
gpUSabJb8XA,246112,251217,Let's measure the largest drinks  to see which country's is bigger.  Fizzy.
gpUSabJb8XA,252852,258224,"So, our large drink actually came out  as closer to 18 ounces than closer to 20.  I will say that in the UK, you fill up your own drink,"
gpUSabJb8XA,258224,262495,"so maybe I just needed to fill a bit more.  OK, so their large is 18 ounces.  What is our small?"
gpUSabJb8XA,264530,269636,"20 ounces. So our small is bigger than their large.  Man, we love drinking our calories in this country."
gpUSabJb8XA,271938,279445,"The fountain drinks at Popeyes come in three sizes.  The small, which is 22 ounces,  the medium, which is 30 ounces,"
gpUSabJb8XA,279445,286085,"and the large, which is, of course, 40 ounces.  40 ounces."
gpUSabJb8XA,287287,292859,"That's so much soda.  In the UK, drinks only come in two sizes,  as a kids size or as a regular size."
gpUSabJb8XA,292859,297430,"We're not sure how much is in either of these,  so we're going to measure them both.  A little over 300."
gpUSabJb8XA,302702,304070,About 450.
gpUSabJb8XA,308474,314514,"But those aren't the biggest, I say!  Actually, at the Popeyes in the US,  you can also get a gallon of sweet tea"
gpUSabJb8XA,314514,320019,[thud]  and unsweetened tea.  One. Whole. Gallon.
gpUSabJb8XA,320887,325992,"[grunts] Look at this.  Gallon, gallon.  Oh, and don't you hate when dummies"
gpUSabJb8XA,325992,332332,"do that thing where they're like,  ""Hey, the medium is the same size as the large!""  And it never is, it's, like, a total con, so."
gpUSabJb8XA,332332,334267,"Medium soda, large cup."
gpUSabJb8XA,338304,344410,"Oh, wow, guys!  The medium's about the same size as the large,  except for, like, oh, I don't know, 10 ounces."
gpUSabJb8XA,344410,350049,"Dumb TikTokers, you guys don't even know.  You're out of your league, TikTokers!  I'm the fast-food king online!"
gpUSabJb8XA,350049,356255,All right?  When was this cleaned last?
gpUSabJb8XA,359392,365198,"Ooh!  I'm gonna go 36, what do you think?"
gpUSabJb8XA,365198,370203,"I mean, it could have been the amount  to top of this cup, but again,  you can't fill this to the brim."
gpUSabJb8XA,370203,377310,"You have to put a cap on it.  In the UK, fries just come as a regular serving.  US, we got two Popeyes fries sizes."
gpUSabJb8XA,377310,382482,"A regular and a large.  The regular, as we have here,  just came with a side of the three-piece we got here."
gpUSabJb8XA,382482,388186,"And, of course, a large,  which is a box of just fries.  Harry: We're going to weigh these to see"
gpUSabJb8XA,388187,393926,"how they compare to the US.  Joe: We, of course, now, are going to  also weigh our largest fry."
gpUSabJb8XA,394994,401234,Do not sleep on these fries.  You'll be surprised to learn
gpUSabJb8XA,401234,406773,that the inside of this scale is disgusting.  A Popeyes chicken sandwich in the UK weighs
gpUSabJb8XA,407707,415948,"exactly 250 grams.  Joe: In the US, it weighs  270 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,415948,421220,"In the US, Popeyes signature chicken  comes in seven serving sizes.  We'll start with these."
gpUSabJb8XA,421220,427193,"So, of course, the one-piece kids meal.  Then you can upgrade to a two-piece regular meal,"
gpUSabJb8XA,427193,434734,which comes with a side and a biscuit.  Or you can get yourself the three-piece.  And a four-piece. Side and a biscuit.
gpUSabJb8XA,434734,441507,"From there, you can get yourself  an eight-piece family meal.  The 12-piece, for the family as well,"
gpUSabJb8XA,441507,447013,"or just for one person over a weekend.  And the largest, the 16-piece."
gpUSabJb8XA,447013,452185,Are you kidding me? [laughs]  How absurd is this?  Look at all this chicken!
gpUSabJb8XA,452185,459125,"In the UK, the signature chicken comes  as a two-piece meal, as a three-piece meal,  or as a six-piece sharer, as a nine-piece sharer,"
gpUSabJb8XA,459125,464730,"or our largest size, the 12-piece sharer.  Let's weigh a wing, a thigh, and a leg  to see whose chickens are bigger."
gpUSabJb8XA,465898,470269,"So, in the UK, our thigh, leg, and wing combo  came to around 290 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,471471,477643,"Here we go. First guy up, the leg.  Next up, got that ♪ wing ♪"
gpUSabJb8XA,477643,480746,"Kind of a wimpy-looking one.  And this one, the thigh."
gpUSabJb8XA,487253,492558,"How 'bout the tendies?  In the US, we have these following sizes.  A kids meal has a one-piece,"
gpUSabJb8XA,492558,498630,"but what's up, they gave us two!  And then from there, you get a three-piece,  which they forgot."
gpUSabJb8XA,499732,506272,And then we have five-piece.  Comes with a side and a biscuit.  Eight pieces. I feel like  they're getting bigger as I go along.
gpUSabJb8XA,506272,512879,"Look at the size of this tender.  Then we have the 12-piece.  I mean, guys, this is like a -- look at this!"
gpUSabJb8XA,512879,519018,"Did you know they're this big?  This is fantastic. I love how big these are.  That's what I'm talking about, Popeyes! Thank you."
gpUSabJb8XA,519018,524724,"And, of course, the 16-piece.  Look at this bad boy.  Look at the size of these guys."
gpUSabJb8XA,524724,531898,"Tenders in the UK come in four portion sizes.  As a two-piece, which is a kids meal,  as a three-piece, a five-piece,"
gpUSabJb8XA,531898,538104,"and an eight-piece.  Next up is the nuggets.  These can be found in servings of a four-piece kids meal,"
gpUSabJb8XA,538104,544110,"a six-piece kids meal, eight-piece,  the 12-piece,  24-piece,"
gpUSabJb8XA,544110,549782,"36 pieces.  And then this double pile right here,  the biggest order,"
gpUSabJb8XA,549782,558357,"48 pieces.  And I have to say,  does not look like enough.  I know I could destroy that 48-piece with confidence."
gpUSabJb8XA,559191,565397,"What do we got here?  Oh, look at this sticker! This is fun!  Yeah, look at these guys!  Look at this big one playing a saxophone."
gpUSabJb8XA,565398,571337,"How fun is that?  That's cool, right?  In the UK, we actually call our nuggets bites,  and they come in the following sizes:"
gpUSabJb8XA,571337,577243,"As a four-piece, which is a kids meal,  a six-piece, a nine-piece, and a 12-piece.  Unfortunately, we couldn't get these today."
gpUSabJb8XA,577243,583783,"USA. We got biscuits, baby!  These are the not-cookie biscuits  that have come up before in other ""Food Wars"" episodes."
gpUSabJb8XA,583783,591022,"These are the biscuits-biscuits.  And at Popeyes, you can get them in one,  either on its own or probably with just about every meal."
gpUSabJb8XA,591023,597263,"You can also get them in six.  It's, like, rolling right down here.  And you can also get them in 12."
gpUSabJb8XA,597263,602268,Just overflowing biscuits over here.  We actually do have biscuits on the UK Popeyes menu.
gpUSabJb8XA,602268,604370,"If you order it as a side, you get one biscuit."
gpUSabJb8XA,607540,612044,"In the UK, Jollibee serves their famous Chickenjoy  in six portion sizes, starting with"
gpUSabJb8XA,612979,617316,"a one-piece.  In the US, you can get your Chickenjoy  in five different portions."
gpUSabJb8XA,618851,624190,"A one-piece with a side.  Next up, we've got a two-piece.  A two-piece,"
gpUSabJb8XA,624190,629261,also with a side.  We move to a three-piece.  A three-piece that comes with a side.
gpUSabJb8XA,629261,635401,"I'm so excited to try this.  It's my first-ever taste of Jollibee fried chicken.  Not my first time, Harry."
gpUSabJb8XA,636335,642108,"Wow, that's good. That's really good.  I don't know how it stayed so crispy.  The next sizes up are buckets of chicken."
gpUSabJb8XA,642108,648480,You can get a bucket in six  or bucket of 10.
gpUSabJb8XA,648481,652351,"Buckets from a UK Jollibee come in three sizes,  starting with a six-piece."
gpUSabJb8XA,654420,657023,"Then, from there, we move up to an eight-piece bucket."
gpUSabJb8XA,659592,663629,"And last but by no means least,  our biggest portion size is a bucket of 12."
gpUSabJb8XA,668467,672704,Should've got a bigger plate.  I need some more.  It's really good.
gpUSabJb8XA,676542,679578,I just love chicken. And this is a good example of it.
gpUSabJb8XA,687353,690222,"These little crispy bits that fall off your chicken,  gold dust."
gpUSabJb8XA,692558,698097,Let's each weigh our six-piece buckets to see if  the Chickenjoy in one country is bigger than the other.  It's time for some Jenga.
gpUSabJb8XA,700199,705237,Ah!  We have over 100 grams more chicken!
gpUSabJb8XA,705237,712610,"[laughs]  I realize this is so arbitrary.  The size of the meat, the amount of coating."
gpUSabJb8XA,712611,717783,"But it's nice to win, regardless.  The chicken at Jollibee also comes"
gpUSabJb8XA,717783,723722,"in the form of tenders. In the UK,  these are served in four portion sizes.  As a single tender."
gpUSabJb8XA,723723,729495,What? One piece? One piece?  Who's getting one chicken tender?  As two tenders.
gpUSabJb8XA,731397,738137,"As a portion of three tenders.  And, finally, as a portion of four."
gpUSabJb8XA,739972,747412,"One chicken tender. I've never heard of that. Anywhere.  Well, here in America,  we have normal portion sizes for our chicken tenders."
gpUSabJb8XA,747413,753652,"You can get them in three pieces, six pieces.  I think three is not enough, but OK."
gpUSabJb8XA,753652,759492,"Three pieces, six pieces,  10 pieces."
gpUSabJb8XA,759492,761794,Whoa!  [sighs]
gpUSabJb8XA,764563,769101,[beep]  Or 16.  Yeah!
gpUSabJb8XA,770436,777409,"Tenders. How do you like that?  Yeah, there's a little bit more going on now.  I like it. Little bit of heat to it."
gpUSabJb8XA,777409,782915,"The batter seems different.  It has more of the buttermilk flavor to it,  of the coating."
gpUSabJb8XA,782915,789155,Yeah.  Garlic mayo. Always.  Who needs ranch when you have garlic mayo?  Who needs garlic mayo when you have ranch?
gpUSabJb8XA,789155,794693,[boxing bell rings]  Ranch is far superior to garlic mayo. No question.
gpUSabJb8XA,796729,802568,"Hell, yeah. Love ranch.  A worthy addition.  Ranch is way better. You got herbs and spices."
gpUSabJb8XA,802568,804370,"Aren't they, like, basically the same thing?"
gpUSabJb8XA,808174,813345,"Then we're on to some Jollibee specialities.  Now, one iconic dish is this one.  This is the Jolly spaghetti."
gpUSabJb8XA,813345,819585,"Now, this is a dish made of spaghetti with some cheese  as well as a sweet-style sauce,  which is, I think, made with banana ketchup"
gpUSabJb8XA,819585,825858,"and some meat as well.  And then it's topped with hot-dog slices.  In the UK, this only comes as one portion size.  That's a cute size you got there, Harry."
gpUSabJb8XA,825858,831697,"But here in the US, we have three sizes,  our regular portion,  our family portion,"
gpUSabJb8XA,831697,836801,and the party portion.  Look at this.  This is supposed to be eight to 10 people.
gpUSabJb8XA,836802,842041,"It's like a lasagna. Look at that.  Now, according to a friend of mine from the Philippines,  the pro move is to dunk the chicken"
gpUSabJb8XA,842041,848180,"into the spaghetti sauce. So let's give that a try.  The cold cheese isn't doing it any favors,"
gpUSabJb8XA,848180,853819,I'll be honest.  OK.  Yeah.  That's actually not bad.
gpUSabJb8XA,853819,859191,"It's a bit misleading because their spaghetti is actually,  the sauce is sweet.  Very good. Yeah, together, that's really good."
gpUSabJb8XA,859191,865264,"Then we're on to the burgers.  Now, Jollibee is famous for its Yumburgers,  which is a beef burger with its signature burger sauce."
gpUSabJb8XA,865264,873472,"In the UK, these come as either a single or as a double.  Over here in the US, you can get the classic Yumburger  or this, the double Yumburger."
gpUSabJb8XA,876775,884550,"Don't want a bun for your burger, you say?  Jollibee has you covered.  They have something called the burger steaks.  Patties of burgers smothered in their mushroom gravy."
gpUSabJb8XA,884550,890623,"You can get them in two patties, three patties,  or the six-patty family pack."
gpUSabJb8XA,890623,896028,"Over here, the burger steaks only come as a two-piece.  In the US, you can get a side of white rice."
gpUSabJb8XA,896028,901533,"We only have one size, and it's this one right here.  Same here. Our rice just comes in one portion,"
gpUSabJb8XA,901533,907373,and it's wrapped up like this. Very cute.  Let's start with the starters.
gpUSabJb8XA,907373,915047,"Now, TGI Fridays in the UK and the US  both have lots of starter options.  So what we're going to do is pick the most popular ones  and compare those. First up, we have the mozzarella sticks."
gpUSabJb8XA,915948,922186,"An order of these in the UK contains four sticks.  In the US, our TGI Fridays mozzarella sticks"
gpUSabJb8XA,922187,929727,"come in an order of six. Six sticks.  Or you can get the platter,  which doubles that. 12 sticks."
gpUSabJb8XA,929728,935935,"Harry: We're going to weigh three UK mozzarella sticks  to try and find the average weight.  Hey, Harry, is that three sticks?"
gpUSabJb8XA,935935,941774,"Thought that order had four?  So, three mozzarella sticks in the UK weighed 95 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,941774,945644,That means that each individual mozzarella stick  weighed an average of 31.6 grams.
gpUSabJb8XA,947279,952284,"Joe: Yes.  So, six sticks is 260 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,952284,957356,So that's roughly  43-point-repeating-3 grams per stick.
gpUSabJb8XA,957356,961760,"Now, pro tip.  Weigh your food, then try one."
gpUSabJb8XA,963429,970769,Mm.  TGI Fridays is running the mozzarella-cheese-stick game.  They're running the mozz-stick game.
gpUSabJb8XA,970769,977309,"Mm.  The UK does have loaded potato skins,  but they're not currently serving them due to the pandemic,  as they don't travel very well for delivery."
gpUSabJb8XA,977309,983482,"However, we were able to find some in the store.  When they are available in the restaurants,  they come in serving sizes of six or 12."
gpUSabJb8XA,983482,988921,"Well, we didn't have that problem in the US,  or maybe we just don't care.  Either way, loaded potato skins are totally available"
gpUSabJb8XA,988921,995561,"at the US TGI Fridays, and they come in two sizes.  You can get them in eight  or you get the platty boy, which is 12."
gpUSabJb8XA,995561,1002101,Chicken wings in the UK come in two portion sizes.  As a single portion of three wings
gpUSabJb8XA,1002101,1008273,"or as a sharing portion,  which is six wings."
gpUSabJb8XA,1009308,1017216,"♪ Chicken wing, chicken wing ♪  Hey, Harry, when I said to compare the wings  between the US and the UK, I meant these wings."
gpUSabJb8XA,1017216,1024288,"Maybe it's cultural differences,  or maybe I just read the menu wrong.  Anyway.  In the US, our wings come in an order of 10,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1024288,1031262,"or you can get a platter of either 30 or 50 wings.  Hell, yeah, dude.  I want to eat every single one of these wings."
gpUSabJb8XA,1031262,1037668,"If you like your chicken off the bone,  you can also get boneless wings at TGI Fridays  in both the UK and the US.  Here, they come in two portion sizes."
gpUSabJb8XA,1037668,1045844,"As a single, which is 7 ounces,  or as a sharing size, which is 14 ounces.  In the US, our TGI Fridays offer boneless wings by ounces."
gpUSabJb8XA,1045844,1051483,"You can get 10 ounces,  40 ounces,  or a platter of 80 ounces!"
gpUSabJb8XA,1051483,1058190,Look at this. You have no idea how good this smells.  That is so good!
gpUSabJb8XA,1058190,1064463,"How are they so good?  The ribs in the UK come in two sizes,  as a half rack or as a full rack."
gpUSabJb8XA,1064463,1070268,And both come in either a legendary or a barbecue glaze.  Our ribs in the US also come in a half slab
gpUSabJb8XA,1070269,1075507,or a full slab.  We're going to weigh our large portion to see  who out of me or Joe has the biggest rack.
gpUSabJb8XA,1075507,1082981,"[ba-dum tss]  So, a large rack of ribs in the UK  came to around 366 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,1082981,1089021,"Bunch of children over there.  ""Joe's rack.""  Grow up!  All right, here we go."
gpUSabJb8XA,1089021,1093692,"Zoop!  Ooh, this guy's already falling apart."
gpUSabJb8XA,1094760,1100199,Tender!  And a full slab in the US is almost 600 grams.
gpUSabJb8XA,1100199,1105637,"How do you like that?  I got the bigger rack.  Most meals in the UK come with a side of fries by default,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1105637,1110642,"so we're going to weigh a regular portion of fries  to see what it comes to.  Joe: Yikes, ours is only 120."
gpUSabJb8XA,1110642,1114480,120 for a side of fries in the US.  Hm.
gpUSabJb8XA,1117449,1123455,"In the UK, Nando's chicken comes in three serving sizes.  A quarter of a chicken."
gpUSabJb8XA,1123455,1129695,"In the US, Nando's standard chicken  comes in just two sizes.  There's a half a chicken."
gpUSabJb8XA,1130896,1136502,"A whole chicken.  Or a fourth of a chicken.  You can get a whole chicken in the US,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1136502,1144576,but only as part of a platter.  And we're going to weigh the whole chicken  to see which country's chickens are bigger.
gpUSabJb8XA,1144576,1151483,"USA chicken, baby!  We can also get bonus thighs in the UK.  If you order these, they come in a portion of four."
gpUSabJb8XA,1151483,1156188,"Our thighs actually come as a portion of three.  So we got one, two, three."
gpUSabJb8XA,1157089,1163028,"♪ Chicken, chicken wings ♪  ♪ They're my favorite thing, and I love to sing ♪"
gpUSabJb8XA,1163028,1168300,"If you haven't already seen it,  look up the ""Nando's Skank,""  which is a very pure distillation of British culture"
gpUSabJb8XA,1168300,1175807,in the late '00s.  It's Ed Sheeran and Example rapping  about Nando's in a car park. I don't know why.
gpUSabJb8XA,1175807,1181380,"And then he's just flexing his black card,  which I'm fuming about.  'Cause, you know, Nando's black card,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1181380,1187219,"they give them out to select individuals,  and it entitles you to free Nando's,  which I'm so jealous of."
gpUSabJb8XA,1187219,1192491,"Also, bone to pick with that in general.  Why do they always give the celebrities the free stuff?  'Cause they're the people who need it least."
gpUSabJb8XA,1192491,1198263,They're already rich. Sort a guy out. Come on.  I'm not a celebrity.
gpUSabJb8XA,1198263,1202367,"Not yet.  Next up in the UK, we've got wings.  They come in four portions."
gpUSabJb8XA,1203535,1208740,A portion of three.  Our wings come as a serving of 12.  A portion of five.
gpUSabJb8XA,1208740,1213779,Or ...  Harry: A portion of 10. Medha: A serving of 24.  Or a portion of 15.
gpUSabJb8XA,1214680,1219951,"If chicken on the bone isn't for you,  Nando's also offers chicken in the form of burgers,  wraps, and pitas. In the UK,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1219952,1227626,you can get these as singles or as doubles.  We can also get our chicken wrapped
gpUSabJb8XA,1227626,1234498,"or burgered.  However, in the US,  there's no option to add double chicken,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1234499,1239037,which sucks.  It's like a little burrito.
gpUSabJb8XA,1240339,1247179,"Holy ...  Don't do ""Food Wars"" without eating breakfast.  I'm going to cry."
gpUSabJb8XA,1247179,1256121,"We're going to remove all the toppings  from the single chicken burger and weigh it  to see how it compares to the US version.  So, we're going to take out the tomato and the lettuce,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1256121,1262394,just like Harry mentioned.  Which is good because tomato does not belong on burgers
gpUSabJb8XA,1262394,1263962,and never should.
gpUSabJb8XA,1270269,1276608,"On the side of your chicken,  it's pretty common to get some chips at Nando's.  I'm excited for this episode because I can actually  call them chips for once, as that's what they're"
gpUSabJb8XA,1276608,1282681,"referred to on the US menu. Suck it, Joe.  Suck it, Joe!  What did I do? Why is everyone telling me to suck it?"
gpUSabJb8XA,1282681,1288120,[laughing]  He's not even hosting this episode.  I just gotta send for him.
gpUSabJb8XA,1288120,1296495,[beep]  Chips in the UK come in regular or large sizes.  The standard US sizes are regular and large.
gpUSabJb8XA,1296762,1303068,"However, if you get them as part of a platter,  you can get the bonus extra-large size."
gpUSabJb8XA,1303068,1310309,"Let's weigh the large fries to see whose is bigger.  Maybe I should've used the bowl. Oh, no."
gpUSabJb8XA,1310309,1314379,I'm still gonna eat these.  I don't care if they touch all these gross ...
gpUSabJb8XA,1321320,1326658,"I'm getting too good at emptying brick chips  from containers.  So, our scale is just about adequate for this one,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1326658,1332030,and a portion of large fries in the UK --  I said fries. Why did I say fries?  I'm being conditioned to saying fries.
gpUSabJb8XA,1332030,1337135,"That's right, buddy. I heard you say fries!  This show is getting to me.  [beep]  A portion of large chips in the UK"
gpUSabJb8XA,1337135,1341106,comes to about 498 grams.  Medha: 150 grams.
gpUSabJb8XA,1343375,1349047,"In the UK, Quiznos sandwiches come in four sizes.  Firstly, we have the kids size, which is 4½ inches."
gpUSabJb8XA,1349047,1355587,"Then we have a small sub, which is 6 inches.  A medium sub from a UK Quiznos is 9 inches,  or at least it should be before we got hungry"
gpUSabJb8XA,1355587,1363495,"and ate it by mistake.  And then finally we have a large sub,  which is 12 inches, or 1 foot long.  In the US, our Quiznos sandwiches come in four sizes."
gpUSabJb8XA,1363495,1369934,"The sammie, a 4-inch, an 8-inch, and a 12-inch.  And I want to give Quiznos props"
gpUSabJb8XA,1369935,1376074,"for not calling this, like, a sandwich taco  or something really obnoxious.  Also in the US at a Quiznos, you can get party platters"
gpUSabJb8XA,1376074,1381179,of either 20 3-inch sandwiches  or 14 flatbreads cut in half.
gpUSabJb8XA,1381179,1388720,"There are no fountain drinks at a Quiznos in the UK.  Instead, we just have cans and bottles,  which are 330 milliliters and 500 milliliters, respectively."
gpUSabJb8XA,1388720,1395360,"In the US at a Quiznos,  you can get your drinks in three sizes.  Either a bottle, which is 20 ounces,  the regular, also 20 ounces,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1395360,1402501,"or the large, which they did not have.  Harry: Let's weigh a classic Italian foot-long  from a Quiznos in the UK to see what it comes to."
gpUSabJb8XA,1402501,1409440,"So, our scales could just about handle that.  Turns out that a foot-long classic Italian  from a UK Quiznos is 520 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,1409441,1416882,"Joe: In the US, Quiznos' classic foot-long Italian  is about, like, 460?"
gpUSabJb8XA,1417549,1424289,"[burps]  Quiznos was one of the first chains to toast their subs,  so now let's arbitrarily compare the toastedness"
gpUSabJb8XA,1424289,1430629,"between our bread and the UK bread.  In our extremely precise comparison metric,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1430629,1435834,"it looks like the US maybe has the edge  when it comes to toastiness of the bread.  The inside of this is completely soggy,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1435834,1443308,"and the outside, just very average.  In the UK, you can get your order in three portion sizes."
gpUSabJb8XA,1443308,1449381,"As a small platter, as a regular platter, or as a sandwich.  The Halal Guys in the US,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1449381,1455787,"your order can come in three sizes.  Small, regular, sandwich.  We're going to weigh a regular platter in both countries"
gpUSabJb8XA,1455787,1462360,to see whose is the biggest.  It's been so many episodes.
gpUSabJb8XA,1462360,1466898,Why don't we just get bigger scales?  Bear with us. One second.
gpUSabJb8XA,1469601,1473205,First half is about 337 grams.
gpUSabJb8XA,1475974,1483080,337 plus 321.  658?
gpUSabJb8XA,1483081,1489354,"Quick maths.  This thing, we need to wash this thing.  It's getting funky in here."
gpUSabJb8XA,1490222,1495227,Here we go. The regular.  Fits in perfectly.
gpUSabJb8XA,1495227,1502067,"640.  640 grams. It's a full meal.  Oh, man, this smells so good."
gpUSabJb8XA,1502067,1509074,"Fries in the UK only come in one portion size, this one.  In the US, The Halal Guys also only have one size fries."
gpUSabJb8XA,1509074,1515914,"Look at this case. Seen this?  Do you think it's to keep them crispy,  so they don't get soggy?  Very smart. Very innovative."
gpUSabJb8XA,1515914,1519317,I wanna eat this so badly. We gotta weigh it first.  This could be another brick.
gpUSabJb8XA,1521286,1526825,"Ah.  Hey.  So, a side of fries from a UK Halal Guys"
gpUSabJb8XA,1526825,1532163,"came to 213 grams.  Wait. Oh, yeah. OK."
gpUSabJb8XA,1532163,1539604,Yeah.  145 grams for one size  of Halal Guys fries.
gpUSabJb8XA,1541773,1549047,"Uh, yeah!  Yo.  I've never gotten the fries. These are good!  Crispy. Don't sleep on the Halal Guys fries."
gpUSabJb8XA,1549047,1552717,"In the UK, a side of hummus only comes in one size,  and it's this one right here."
gpUSabJb8XA,1555320,1562527,"In the US of A, Halal Guys hummus only comes in one size,  and of course we are going to weigh it."
gpUSabJb8XA,1562527,1568934,"Harry: So, our side order of hummus came in at 246 grams.  I'm going to eat all of this  as soon as the cameras stop rolling."
gpUSabJb8XA,1568934,1574606,"A side order of baba ghanoush in the UK  only comes in one size as well.  Joe: In the US, the baba ghanoush at The Halal Guys"
gpUSabJb8XA,1574606,1580778,"is also just one size.  In the UK, you can get a side of falafel,  and it comes as a two-piece serving."
gpUSabJb8XA,1580779,1588252,"We did ask for some, but I think the guy forgot,  so we don't have any to show you.  In the US at The Halal Guys,  you can get your falafel in three sizes."
gpUSabJb8XA,1588253,1593023,"Two pieces, four pieces, or six pieces.  We can also get falafel sandwiches."
gpUSabJb8XA,1593992,1599397,"Let's take some measurements.  Our falafel sandwich is 8 inches in diameter.  And for the moment you've all been waiting for,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1599397,1605870,"we're going to measure the girth.  The tape measure is really not fit to task.  Actually, no. That's kind of worked."
gpUSabJb8XA,1605870,1613645,"And our falafel sandwich has a girth of,  let's say 7 and a bit inches.  From pita to pita."
gpUSabJb8XA,1613645,1620885,"8 inches.  Yeah. Oh, look at that!  And it's 8 inches thick. 8 and 8."
gpUSabJb8XA,1620885,1626992,"I like when things are just precise like that.  Harry: And finally, it weighs 286 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,1626992,1631195,And a falafel sandwich at the US Halal Guys  ♪ weighs ♪
gpUSabJb8XA,1632497,1638002,"like, exactly  [burps] excuse me.  Exactly 250 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,1638003,1645777,"In the UK, if you want dessert at Halal Guys,  you can get baklava.  It comes in a two-piece serving.  Halal Guys in the US, the baklava comes in one size,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1645777,1652651,"in this one piece,  this piece right here.  Oops, I ordered two! I guess I'll just have to eat one!"
gpUSabJb8XA,1652651,1660325,"Who am I kidding? I'm eating both of these.  Let's start with the drinks.  In the UK, the majority of hot drinks only come in one size,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1660325,1665730,which is 12 ounces.  Pret says this is to optimize efficiency  and to keep things simple for customers.
gpUSabJb8XA,1665730,1671502,"However, there are two exceptions to this rule.  Firstly, if you order a flat white from a UK Pret,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1671503,1678809,"it served as an 8-ounce drink.  Then, if you order an espresso or a macchiato,  it comes in one of these adorable little 4-ounce cups."
gpUSabJb8XA,1678810,1682681,"All right. So, in the US,  our hot coffees come in three sizes."
gpUSabJb8XA,1684149,1689454,"Small,  medium,  and large."
gpUSabJb8XA,1689454,1693558,This is ridiculous.  But we also have some exceptions to the rules.
gpUSabJb8XA,1694793,1701666,"Our flat white is only served as an 8-ounce drink,  but our macchiato is 4 ounces, like the UK's,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1701666,1707839,and our espresso is actually just 2 ounces.  I guess they're trying to limit our caffeine intake. Maybe.
gpUSabJb8XA,1707839,1711943,Harry: We're going to measure our largest black coffee  to find out if you're actually getting  as much as you're told you are.
gpUSabJb8XA,1713244,1720552,"So, to Pret's credit, that is exactly 12 ounces.  We are not getting as much coffee as they say we are,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1720552,1727025,"but maybe that's a good thing.  20's kind of a lot.  Not getting as much coffee as advertised, huh, Irene?"
gpUSabJb8XA,1727025,1733865,"Welcome to ""Food Wars.""  What about iced coffees?  Well, in the UK, these also just come in one size.  Well, over here, we can get iced black coffee"
gpUSabJb8XA,1733865,1738870,as either a 16- or 24-ounce serving.
gpUSabJb8XA,1739037,1745110,It's a lot of coffee.  I don't get people who drink black coffee.  Harry: We're both going to measure our largest
gpUSabJb8XA,1745110,1752217,"iced black coffee to find out what they come to.  So, once again, this came to exactly 12 ounces."
gpUSabJb8XA,1752217,1757888,"So, the iced coffee is also not the advertised amount.  It's supposed to be 24 ounces,"
gpUSabJb8XA,1757889,1764629,but it looks like it's only about 21.  It's an international coffee conspiracy!
gpUSabJb8XA,1764629,1771970,"Season two, we're still dealing with this.  I mean, is someone gonna do something about this?  Once again, maybe not a bad thing?"
gpUSabJb8XA,1773037,1778743,I feel like a lot of people are going to disagree with that.  Do you need this much caffeine in your life?  Probably.
gpUSabJb8XA,1778743,1784983,I don't know if Joe or Harry drinks this much coffee.  I feel like Joe might. He seems like he would.
gpUSabJb8XA,1784983,1790455,"He has that energy.  Joe just looks like he just drinks, like,  five cups of black coffee a day"
gpUSabJb8XA,1790455,1795960,"and then he's up at 2 a.m. Joe: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.  just, like, haunted. Joe: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.  Yes, I do. I drink a lot of coffee."
gpUSabJb8XA,1795960,1801766,"I should say that it's only April,  and I've already passed three kidney stones this year.  What about some of the food options?"
gpUSabJb8XA,1801766,1808773,This is an egg salad sandwich from a UK Pret.  We're going to weigh this one to see how much it comes to.  Irene: It's exactly 250 grams.
gpUSabJb8XA,1808773,1814546,"Maybe our eggs are heavier.  It's all those preservatives.  If you were raised here, you wouldn't be worried."
gpUSabJb8XA,1814546,1816047,We should probably be worried.
gpUSabJb8XA,1820084,1826691,It's not that good.  But I'm hungry.  Egg salad is ♪ gross ♪
gpUSabJb8XA,1826691,1832063,"Like, it generally doesn't taste good,  but I'm just taking bites of it.  So that was a classic sandwich. But what about a baguette?"
gpUSabJb8XA,1832063,1837235,"This is a ham and cheese baguette from a UK Pret.  So, our UK ham and cheese baguette  came to exactly 200 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,1837235,1844375,"Well, here's our famous ham and cheese baguette.  It says it should weigh 251 grams."
gpUSabJb8XA,1847879,1853117,It's exactly 251 grams. That's impressive.  It's actually kind of scary.
gpUSabJb8XA,1853117,1859390,"I know it should weigh exactly the amount it says it should,  but it's kind of cool when it actually does.  Next up, we've got this muffin."
gpUSabJb8XA,1859390,1865029,"This is a double berry muffin from a UK Pret,  which is a blueberry muffin  with some extra blueberry compote in the middle."
gpUSabJb8XA,1865029,1871669,"All right. So, we have our classic blueberry muffin,  without the extra compote in the middle."
gpUSabJb8XA,1871669,1878176,Harry: Let's find out how much it weighs.  Do you know the muffin man?
gpUSabJb8XA,1878176,1884048,"The muffin man?  The muffin man!  Yes, I know the muffin man who lives on Drury Lane.  God, I love ""Shrek."""
gpUSabJb8XA,1884048,1890855,"Can we get a Harry Shrek?  Can we get Harry's face turned into Shrek, please?  You know I've never seen ""Shrek""?"
gpUSabJb8XA,1890855,1893257,My surname's an anagram of Shrek.
