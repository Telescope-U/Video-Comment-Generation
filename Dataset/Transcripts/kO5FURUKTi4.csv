kO5FURUKTi4,16340,19220,up over 60% from the previous year.
kO5FURUKTi4,19220,21880,And its stock reached record highs.
kO5FURUKTi4,21880,24150,- The past few years for Crocs has been this moment
kO5FURUKTi4,24150,27830,"of heavy collaboration, constant releases."
kO5FURUKTi4,27830,29880,They're really trying to put themselves
kO5FURUKTi4,29880,30939,in front of people
kO5FURUKTi4,30940,33384,that might not have considered Crocs prior.

kO5FURUKTi4,40770,43100,especially as its stock price has been dropping
kO5FURUKTi4,43100,45300,since the pandemic boom has waned.
kO5FURUKTi4,45300,47230,But other comfortable footwear brands
kO5FURUKTi4,47230,49430,didn't take off the way Crocs did.
kO5FURUKTi4,49430,50930,So how did Crocs make a name
kO5FURUKTi4,50930,52470,for itself during the pandemic?
kO5FURUKTi4,52470,54520,And how did it find success as one
kO5FURUKTi4,54520,57120,of fashion's most divisive shoes?
kO5FURUKTi4,57120,59593,This is The Economics of Crocs.
kO5FURUKTi4,60550,62940,"The company was founded in 2002,"
kO5FURUKTi4,62940,65729,the same year it debuted its classic clog.
kO5FURUKTi4,65730,67340,The name Crocs was inspired
kO5FURUKTi4,67340,71079,by crocodiles who live on land and in water.
kO5FURUKTi4,71080,72050,"- When Crocs were first released,"
kO5FURUKTi4,72050,74070,they were intended for a consumer
kO5FURUKTi4,74070,75810,"that was looking at them as a functional thing,"
kO5FURUKTi4,75810,78960,"so probably gardeners, people that were on boats,"
kO5FURUKTi4,78960,80960,"people that worked all day on their feet,"
kO5FURUKTi4,80960,82930,people that worked on a line at a kitchen.
kO5FURUKTi4,82930,84570,- [Narrator] Part of what makes them so functional
kO5FURUKTi4,84570,85490,"is the material,"
kO5FURUKTi4,85490,88640,a proprietary closed-cell resin called Croslite
kO5FURUKTi4,88640,89970,"that's slip resistant,"
kO5FURUKTi4,89970,92340,lightweight and easy to clean.
kO5FURUKTi4,92340,93399,- Producing a molded shoe
kO5FURUKTi4,93400,95500,is certainly simpler in a lot of ways
kO5FURUKTi4,95500,97050,than assembling a sneaker.
kO5FURUKTi4,97050,99270,The most underrated advantage they have
kO5FURUKTi4,99270,100159,over the marketplace
kO5FURUKTi4,100160,103230,is that it's clear that they're able to kind of do things
kO5FURUKTi4,103230,105260,that other companies would not be able to do
kO5FURUKTi4,105260,106160,because of their scale
kO5FURUKTi4,106160,107970,and because of their production capabilities.
kO5FURUKTi4,107970,109670,- [Narrator] Crocs sales tool off.
kO5FURUKTi4,109670,110920,"In the first 3/4 of 2005,"
kO5FURUKTi4,111850,114280,"it sold 4.4 million shoes,"
kO5FURUKTi4,114280,116562,hitting a revenue of $75 million.
kO5FURUKTi4,117530,119650,Part of the reason for its initial success
kO5FURUKTi4,119650,121400,was that the shoe was easy to get.
kO5FURUKTi4,121400,123160,"It was available at retail stores,"
kO5FURUKTi4,123160,125360,gift shops and mall kiosks.
kO5FURUKTi4,125360,128160,"In 2006, Crocs purchased Jibbitz,"
kO5FURUKTi4,128160,130780,a company that made small plastic shoe charms.
kO5FURUKTi4,130780,132830,"That same year, the company went public"
kO5FURUKTi4,132830,136670,and became the largest-ever US footwear IPO at the time.
kO5FURUKTi4,136670,139650,"But in 2008, in the midst of the financial crash,"
kO5FURUKTi4,139650,143803,the company suffered a net income loss of $185 million.
kO5FURUKTi4,144640,146450,"Though the initial craze had simmered,"
kO5FURUKTi4,146450,148250,the brand still managed to hang on
kO5FURUKTi4,148250,150300,to a relatively large customer base
kO5FURUKTi4,150300,153150,over the next few years thanks to its global presence.
kO5FURUKTi4,153150,156209,"In 2014, Crocs started making major changes"
kO5FURUKTi4,156210,157100,"to its business model,"
kO5FURUKTi4,157100,159900,"closing dozens of stores, shifting away from malls"
kO5FURUKTi4,159900,162360,and turning to online sellers like Amazon.
kO5FURUKTi4,162360,165940,- Crocs announcing today it will eliminate nearly 200 jobs
kO5FURUKTi4,165940,168040,and close a number of retail stores as part
kO5FURUKTi4,168040,169510,of a restructuring effort.
kO5FURUKTi4,169510,170939,- [Narrator] The company also cut back
kO5FURUKTi4,170940,174480,"on the number of styles it sold by between 30 and 40%,"
kO5FURUKTi4,174480,178120,and refocused on the classic clog that made it famous.
kO5FURUKTi4,178120,179069,"The following year,"
kO5FURUKTi4,179070,181300,Crocs invested in a global marketing push
kO5FURUKTi4,181300,183223,to relaunch its brand image.
kO5FURUKTi4,183223,185540,(lively music)
kO5FURUKTi4,185540,186769,"Despite its efforts,"
kO5FURUKTi4,186770,188550,the company's stock held steady
kO5FURUKTi4,188550,191270,until 2020 when the global pandemic hit.
kO5FURUKTi4,191270,192520,- Prior to people working from home
kO5FURUKTi4,192520,194090,"and not wearing their dress shoes,"
kO5FURUKTi4,194090,195120,"not wearing their heels,"
kO5FURUKTi4,195120,197250,there was already this rising wave
kO5FURUKTi4,197250,199970,"of comfort-minded, comfort-first footwear"
kO5FURUKTi4,199970,201900,that was really becoming more popular.
kO5FURUKTi4,201900,203980,"Of course, that accelerated during the pandemic."
kO5FURUKTi4,203980,206150,- [Narrator] The comfort aspect is what many call the key
kO5FURUKTi4,206150,208890,to Crocs' success but another important factor
kO5FURUKTi4,208890,212000,is how easy it is to customize the shoe with Jibbitz.
kO5FURUKTi4,212000,214470,You could move them to different Crocs over time
kO5FURUKTi4,214470,217970,"as you got a green pair, a camo pair, a pink pair."
kO5FURUKTi4,217970,220040,The Jibbitz would stay with you and they were yours.
kO5FURUKTi4,220040,223430,They were almost like the way a key chain on a backpack was
kO5FURUKTi4,223430,224629,at a certain point.
kO5FURUKTi4,224630,226240,- [Narrator] This idea of individuality
kO5FURUKTi4,226240,227740,and self-expression is one
kO5FURUKTi4,227740,230779,that the brand emphasizes through its marketing campaigns.
kO5FURUKTi4,230779,232730,(upbeat music)
kO5FURUKTi4,232730,233920,"And on social media,"
kO5FURUKTi4,233920,236970,the uniqueness of the shoe's design has sparked debate.
kO5FURUKTi4,236970,238720,"- Even going back to Crocs' early days,"
kO5FURUKTi4,238720,240180,there were two warring factions
kO5FURUKTi4,240180,242739,"of Crocs are ugly and they're a blight on society,"
kO5FURUKTi4,242740,243700,and we need to get rid of them.
kO5FURUKTi4,243700,246709,"- I don't care how comfortable they are, they're ugly."
kO5FURUKTi4,246710,247990,"- And then there were people that said,"
kO5FURUKTi4,247990,249930,"no, they're cute and they're kind of doughy"
kO5FURUKTi4,249930,250829,and they're fun.
kO5FURUKTi4,250830,254770,- [Shopper] Look how freaking cute these are.
kO5FURUKTi4,254770,257010,"- [Narrator] Crocs leaned into this polarization,"
kO5FURUKTi4,257010,259239,partnering with celebrities and well-known brands
kO5FURUKTi4,259239,262370,to create limited edition versions of the classic clog.
kO5FURUKTi4,262370,263900,- I think that's probably the biggest shift
kO5FURUKTi4,263900,265800,within the fashion world of the past decade
kO5FURUKTi4,265800,268379,is that people truly seem to design for Instagram
kO5FURUKTi4,268380,270640,because you wanna stop people from scrolling
kO5FURUKTi4,270640,272260,"and certainly, a show plastered"
kO5FURUKTi4,272260,274020,with fried chicken does that.
kO5FURUKTi4,274020,277410,"- [Narrator] In 2018, Crocs says its Balenciaga clog,"
kO5FURUKTi4,277410,280370,"an $850 four-inch platform shoe,"
kO5FURUKTi4,280370,282210,sold out within hours.
kO5FURUKTi4,282210,284750,"And in 2021, Crocs says it partnered"
kO5FURUKTi4,284750,287810,"with more than two dozen brands, artists and creators"
kO5FURUKTi4,287810,290330,through collaborations and license programs.
kO5FURUKTi4,290330,291710,- Sometimes it was through Jibbitz
kO5FURUKTi4,291710,293580,but sometimes it was like these kind
kO5FURUKTi4,293580,297819,of crazy revamping of what their clog was.
kO5FURUKTi4,297820,299890,- [Narrator] Constantly releasing new collaborations
kO5FURUKTi4,299890,301880,has not only kept Crocs in the press
kO5FURUKTi4,301880,305260,but it has also helped it break into new markets.
kO5FURUKTi4,305260,306730,- There're like Croc collectors
kO5FURUKTi4,306730,308760,that go after every model.
kO5FURUKTi4,308760,310880,"- [Collector] Honey, I am overflowing with Crocs."
kO5FURUKTi4,310880,312660,- The same way that Nikes resell
kO5FURUKTi4,312660,314590,"on website like Stock and eBay,"
kO5FURUKTi4,314590,315970,Crocs are now reselling.
kO5FURUKTi4,315970,317670,- [Narrator] Crocs and other comfortable shoes
kO5FURUKTi4,317670,319310,may have peaked with the pandemic
kO5FURUKTi4,319310,321510,as people begin to migrate back into work
kO5FURUKTi4,321510,323700,and consider more traditionalist footwear.
kO5FURUKTi4,323700,326550,But many others are still prioritizing comfort.
kO5FURUKTi4,326550,328960,- We're saying that with a lot of doughy running sneakers
kO5FURUKTi4,328960,329880,that people are wearing.
kO5FURUKTi4,329880,332410,We're seeing that certainly with the growth of slides
kO5FURUKTi4,332410,334220,as a huge business in the luxury market.
kO5FURUKTi4,334220,337050,- [Narrator] Crocs's stock has dropped around 60%
kO5FURUKTi4,337050,339379,since its November 2021 high.
kO5FURUKTi4,339380,341740,- I think the market's nervous about the short term.
kO5FURUKTi4,341740,345249,So we're definitely seeing supply constraints
kO5FURUKTi4,345249,347009,in the first quarter.
kO5FURUKTi4,347010,349140,- [Narrator] But the company says its fourth straight year
kO5FURUKTi4,349140,352200,"of revenue growth is fueled by continued global demand,"
kO5FURUKTi4,352200,357030,and it expects revenue to grow to over $5 billion by 2026.
kO5FURUKTi4,357030,359900,- I think that they might plateau at a certain point.
kO5FURUKTi4,359900,363699,"You can only reach so many consumers but I think for now,"
kO5FURUKTi4,363700,367020,they have been able to convince enough consumers
kO5FURUKTi4,367020,369169,that they deserve space within their closet.
kO5FURUKTi4,369170,371168,- And they gotta have the two fingers.

kO5FURUKTi4,194090,195120,"not wearing their heels,"
kO5FURUKTi4,195120,197250,there was already this rising wave
kO5FURUKTi4,197250,199970,"of comfort-minded, comfort-first footwear"
kO5FURUKTi4,199970,201900,that was really becoming more popular.
kO5FURUKTi4,201900,203980,"Of course, that accelerated during the pandemic."
kO5FURUKTi4,203980,206150,- [Narrator] The comfort aspect is what many call the key
kO5FURUKTi4,206150,208890,to Crocs' success but another important factor
kO5FURUKTi4,208890,212000,is how easy it is to customize the shoe with Jibbitz.
kO5FURUKTi4,212000,214470,You could move them to different Crocs over time
kO5FURUKTi4,214470,217970,"as you got a green pair, a camo pair, a pink pair."
kO5FURUKTi4,217970,220040,The Jibbitz would stay with you and they were yours.
kO5FURUKTi4,220040,223430,They were almost like the way a key chain on a backpack was
kO5FURUKTi4,223430,224629,at a certain point.
kO5FURUKTi4,224630,226240,- [Narrator] This idea of individuality
kO5FURUKTi4,226240,227740,and self-expression is one
kO5FURUKTi4,227740,230779,that the brand emphasizes through its marketing campaigns.
kO5FURUKTi4,230779,232730,(upbeat music)
kO5FURUKTi4,232730,233920,"And on social media,"
kO5FURUKTi4,233920,236970,the uniqueness of the shoe's design has sparked debate.
kO5FURUKTi4,236970,238720,"- Even going back to Crocs' early days,"
kO5FURUKTi4,238720,240180,there were two warring factions
kO5FURUKTi4,240180,242739,"of Crocs are ugly and they're a blight on society,"
kO5FURUKTi4,242740,243700,and we need to get rid of them.
kO5FURUKTi4,243700,246709,"- I don't care how comfortable they are, they're ugly."
kO5FURUKTi4,246710,247990,"- And then there were people that said,"
kO5FURUKTi4,247990,249930,"no, they're cute and they're kind of doughy"
kO5FURUKTi4,249930,250829,and they're fun.
kO5FURUKTi4,250830,254770,- [Shopper] Look how freaking cute these are.
kO5FURUKTi4,254770,257010,"- [Narrator] Crocs leaned into this polarization,"
kO5FURUKTi4,257010,259239,partnering with celebrities and well-known brands
kO5FURUKTi4,259239,262370,to create limited edition versions of the classic clog.
kO5FURUKTi4,262370,263900,- I think that's probably the biggest shift
kO5FURUKTi4,263900,265800,within the fashion world of the past decade
kO5FURUKTi4,265800,268379,is that people truly seem to design for Instagram
kO5FURUKTi4,268380,270640,because you wanna stop people from scrolling
kO5FURUKTi4,270640,272260,"and certainly, a show plastered"
kO5FURUKTi4,272260,274020,with fried chicken does that.
kO5FURUKTi4,274020,277410,"- [Narrator] In 2018, Crocs says its Balenciaga clog,"
kO5FURUKTi4,277410,280370,"an $850 four-inch platform shoe,"
kO5FURUKTi4,280370,282210,sold out within hours.
kO5FURUKTi4,282210,284750,"And in 2021, Crocs says it partnered"
kO5FURUKTi4,284750,287810,"with more than two dozen brands, artists and creators"
kO5FURUKTi4,287810,290330,through collaborations and license programs.
kO5FURUKTi4,290330,291710,- Sometimes it was through Jibbitz
kO5FURUKTi4,291710,293580,but sometimes it was like these kind
kO5FURUKTi4,293580,297819,of crazy revamping of what their clog was.
kO5FURUKTi4,297820,299890,- [Narrator] Constantly releasing new collaborations
kO5FURUKTi4,299890,301880,has not only kept Crocs in the press
kO5FURUKTi4,301880,305260,but it has also helped it break into new markets.
kO5FURUKTi4,305260,306730,- There're like Croc collectors
kO5FURUKTi4,306730,308760,that go after every model.
kO5FURUKTi4,308760,310880,"- [Collector] Honey, I am overflowing with Crocs."
kO5FURUKTi4,310880,312660,- The same way that Nikes resell
kO5FURUKTi4,312660,314590,"on website like Stock and eBay,"
kO5FURUKTi4,314590,315970,Crocs are now reselling.
kO5FURUKTi4,315970,317670,- [Narrator] Crocs and other comfortable shoes
kO5FURUKTi4,317670,319310,may have peaked with the pandemic
kO5FURUKTi4,319310,321510,as people begin to migrate back into work
kO5FURUKTi4,321510,323700,and consider more traditionalist footwear.
kO5FURUKTi4,323700,326550,But many others are still prioritizing comfort.
kO5FURUKTi4,326550,328960,- We're saying that with a lot of doughy running sneakers
kO5FURUKTi4,328960,329880,that people are wearing.
kO5FURUKTi4,329880,332410,We're seeing that certainly with the growth of slides
kO5FURUKTi4,332410,334220,as a huge business in the luxury market.
kO5FURUKTi4,334220,337050,- [Narrator] Crocs's stock has dropped around 60%
kO5FURUKTi4,337050,339379,since its November 2021 high.
kO5FURUKTi4,339380,341740,- I think the market's nervous about the short term.
kO5FURUKTi4,341740,345249,So we're definitely seeing supply constraints
kO5FURUKTi4,345249,347009,in the first quarter.
kO5FURUKTi4,347010,349140,- [Narrator] But the company says its fourth straight year
kO5FURUKTi4,349140,352200,"of revenue growth is fueled by continued global demand,"
kO5FURUKTi4,352200,357030,and it expects revenue to grow to over $5 billion by 2026.
kO5FURUKTi4,357030,359900,- I think that they might plateau at a certain point.
kO5FURUKTi4,359900,363699,"You can only reach so many consumers but I think for now,"
kO5FURUKTi4,363700,367020,they have been able to convince enough consumers
kO5FURUKTi4,367020,369169,that they deserve space within their closet.
kO5FURUKTi4,369170,371168,- And they gotta have the two fingers.
