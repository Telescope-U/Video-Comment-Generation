kOa2azsFRfA,4000,5520,well we also had some major tech
kOa2azsFRfA,5520,7680,downgrades out of jpmorgan this morning
kOa2azsFRfA,7680,10080,doug enmith leading the team there 26
kOa2azsFRfA,10080,12559,companies had their estimates and price
kOa2azsFRfA,12559,15759,targets slashed and this has to do with
kOa2azsFRfA,15759,17760,what we've just been talking about this
kOa2azsFRfA,17760,19840,outlook for the economy alphabet amazon
kOa2azsFRfA,19840,22880,meta netflix snap twitter and more uh
kOa2azsFRfA,22880,25599,are on this list and this is because
kOa2azsFRfA,25599,27279,anmeth and his team are looking at what
kOa2azsFRfA,27279,29279,the economists at jp morgan are saying
kOa2azsFRfA,29279,31840,they're saying there could be a 66
kOa2azsFRfA,31840,34000,chance of recession over the next two
kOa2azsFRfA,34000,35440,years what's the effect going to be on
kOa2azsFRfA,35440,38000,these companies nothing good is the long
kOa2azsFRfA,38000,40000,and short of it here um the biggest
kOa2azsFRfA,40000,41920,estimate reductions he says come in
kOa2azsFRfA,41920,44399,online advertising and e-commerce
kOa2azsFRfA,44399,45920,although they're cutting for a lot of
kOa2azsFRfA,45920,47840,different stuff they are saying we
kOa2azsFRfA,47840,50000,believe buy-side expectations and many
kOa2azsFRfA,50000,52800,equity prices already reflect a softer
kOa2azsFRfA,52800,54719,macro environment so
kOa2azsFRfA,54719,56160,even though he's cutting a lot of these
kOa2azsFRfA,56160,58640,estimates he's still saying some of this
kOa2azsFRfA,58640,61280,could already be priced in yeah look i
kOa2azsFRfA,61280,62960,understand these calls and uh but i'm
kOa2azsFRfA,62960,64320,going through this list i'm not seeing
kOa2azsFRfA,64320,65680,any sell ratings and i'm a little
kOa2azsFRfA,65680,67040,surprised to see overweight
kOa2azsFRfA,67040,68880,recommendations on uber and lyft and i
kOa2azsFRfA,68880,70560,know the price targets are coming down
kOa2azsFRfA,70560,73200,but if you're looking at a 66 percent
kOa2azsFRfA,73200,74560,chance of a recession over the next two
kOa2azsFRfA,74560,76240,years you would think you would maybe
kOa2azsFRfA,76240,77680,get a little more aggressive with these
kOa2azsFRfA,77680,78720,ratings a little more aggressive with
kOa2azsFRfA,78720,80400,these price targets even the price
kOa2azsFRfA,80400,83119,target reductions on alphabet uh amazon
kOa2azsFRfA,83119,85439,met and netflix they're still above
kOa2azsFRfA,85439,87600,where the stock is currently trading so
kOa2azsFRfA,87600,88960,it's sending a lot of mixed signals i
kOa2azsFRfA,88960,90560,think the thing that did jump out to me
kOa2azsFRfA,90560,94000,though the 10 companies out of this 26
kOa2azsFRfA,94000,96560,that were advertising revenue driven
kOa2azsFRfA,96560,98079,businesses at the end of the day where
kOa2azsFRfA,98079,101040,you have alphabet of course amazon meta
kOa2azsFRfA,101040,103040,snap twitter the list goes on and i
kOa2azsFRfA,103040,104880,think for companies that are looking
kOa2azsFRfA,104880,106320,across some of their own cost
kOa2azsFRfA,106320,108320,restructuring right now where they are
kOa2azsFRfA,108320,109840,pulling back on that ad spend that's a
kOa2azsFRfA,109840,112399,theme that's going to likely play out
kOa2azsFRfA,112399,113920,itself in this earnings season as well
kOa2azsFRfA,113920,115680,when we hear from companies to see
kOa2azsFRfA,115680,117680,exactly how much they are pulling back
kOa2azsFRfA,117680,119680,on that spending and how that's going to
kOa2azsFRfA,119680,120799,impact their revenue at the end of the
kOa2azsFRfA,120799,123040,day too in that client or customer
kOa2azsFRfA,123040,124880,acquisition but then even more so from
kOa2azsFRfA,124880,126960,here it comes at a time where co ceo
kOa2azsFRfA,126960,129520,confidence is waning we saw that show up
kOa2azsFRfA,129520,131680,in even more data that was out from the
kOa2azsFRfA,131680,133680,deloitte and fortune ceo survey more
kOa2azsFRfA,133680,136080,than 80 percent of ceos surveyed expect
kOa2azsFRfA,136080,138239,inflation to influence or disrupt their
kOa2azsFRfA,138239,140239,business strategy within the next 12
kOa2azsFRfA,140239,142560,months and that's now surpassing labor
kOa2azsFRfA,142560,144480,and skill shortage from its previous top
kOa2azsFRfA,144480,146000,position one of the other things that
kOa2azsFRfA,146000,147599,anmeth says in this note that i think is
kOa2azsFRfA,147599,149280,really interesting context he's
kOa2azsFRfA,149280,152080,comparing this period to the 2008 2009
kOa2azsFRfA,152080,154000,financial crisis and obviously recession
kOa2azsFRfA,154000,156160,there he says the key difference is that
kOa2azsFRfA,156160,159040,digital only accounted this is
kOa2azsFRfA,159040,161599,12 of total ad spending at that time you
kOa2azsFRfA,161599,163120,want to guess at how much it accounts
kOa2azsFRfA,163120,167280,for now i'm going 60 70.
kOa2azsFRfA,167519,170800,in between the two 67 in 2021. he says
kOa2azsFRfA,170800,172560,so online spending is now far more
kOa2azsFRfA,172560,174879,exposed to broader macro trends obvious
kOa2azsFRfA,174879,177200,you know which makes sense right so
kOa2azsFRfA,177200,179680,um it's it's interesting to see this
kOa2azsFRfA,179680,180640,sort of
kOa2azsFRfA,180640,183200,um big picture view of how all of this
kOa2azsFRfA,183200,184560,is going to play out between the ceo
kOa2azsFRfA,184560,186319,confidence and slowing economy yeah on
kOa2azsFRfA,186319,188000,recession you know we just mentioned jp
kOa2azsFRfA,188000,189760,morgan citigroup nathan sheets front of
kOa2azsFRfA,189760,191120,the show also out this morning saying
kOa2azsFRfA,191120,193200,there's a 50 chance of a recession next
kOa2azsFRfA,193200,195440,year deutsche bank's matthews eddie uh
kOa2azsFRfA,195440,197360,two weeks ago his economist raised up
kOa2azsFRfA,197360,198879,his respect pulled forward his recession
kOa2azsFRfA,198879,200640,timeline for next year so these calls
kOa2azsFRfA,200640,201840,are starting to pile up on a recession
kOa2azsFRfA,201840,203200,he's got to change his last name to wawa
kOa2azsFRfA,203200,206480,though much better than she
