oQMViymb610,0,6720,[Music]  everybody is feeding yourself on  the hysteria and the negativity you
oQMViymb610,6720,12639,gotta stay in the light  but one of the reasons why i was so
oQMViymb610,12639,17680,excited is about a wrinkle in time  because the message is that the darkness
oQMViymb610,17680,23199,is spreading so fast these days you must  become a warrior of the light and the
oQMViymb610,23199,31599,reason that's so meaningful to me is  because that's how i've led my whole  life  for these times the darkness is there to
oQMViymb610,31599,36719,show you your light look at what has  happened so if you put the focus on look
oQMViymb610,36719,41920,at what happened with the darkness that  showed up in parkland and the darkness  that showed up on the streets of
oQMViymb610,41920,47120,ferguson the darkness that showed up in  many many many many many many homes in
oQMViymb610,47120,53920,chicago with shootings and uh senseless  murders  it brings out the best in people it
oQMViymb610,53920,62320,brings out the best and so that's what  it's there we live on a planet where  there is darkness and light
oQMViymb610,63039,68320,i deeply believe is not that do unto  others as you would have them do unto  you
oQMViymb610,68320,74000,what you do is already done  that moment in the color purple where  she says everything you ever try to do
oQMViymb610,74000,79840,to me already done to you so the law the  third law of motion in physics says that
oQMViymb610,79840,85920,what you're putting out is coming back  all the time regardless of whether you
oQMViymb610,85920,91520,know it or acknowledge it or not  i say to the my girls
oQMViymb610,91520,98560,all of the time that your real work  is to figure out
oQMViymb610,98560,105439,where your power base is  and to work on the alignment of your
oQMViymb610,105439,112320,personality your gifts that you have to  give with the real reason why you're  here that's that's the number one thing
oQMViymb610,112320,119439,you have to do is to work on yourself  and to fill your self up
oQMViymb610,119439,125520,and keep your cup full keep yourself  full now i used to be afraid of that
oQMViymb610,125520,133920,i used to be afraid particularly from  people who say oh she said she's still  fella hassan  she's so close herself and now i embrace
oQMViymb610,133920,140319,it  i i consider it a compliment that i am  full  of myself
oQMViymb610,140319,145440,because you only when you're full  i'm full i'm overflowing my cup runneth
oQMViymb610,145440,151599,over  i have so much i have so much to offer  and so much to give and i am not afraid
oQMViymb610,151599,158959,of honoring myself you know it's  miraculous when you think about it
oQMViymb610,158959,164480,my life is fueled by my being  and the being fuels the doing
oQMViymb610,164480,170400,so i come from a centered place i come  from a focused place  i come from
oQMViymb610,170400,177040,compassion  i come from a willingness to understand  and to be understood
oQMViymb610,177040,182560,and i come from wanting to to connect i  mean the secret of that show for 25
oQMViymb610,182560,189200,years is that people could see  themselves in me  all over the world they could see
oQMViymb610,189200,195120,themselves in me and even as i became  more and more financially successful
oQMViymb610,195120,200400,which was a big surprise to me i was  like oh my god this is so exciting
oQMViymb610,200400,206319,but what i realized is  through the whole process because i'm  grounded
oQMViymb610,206319,213360,in my own  self  that  although i could have more shoes
oQMViymb610,213360,219920,my feet stayed on the ground although i  was wearing better shoes these are kind  of cute today too  so i could keep my feet on the ground
oQMViymb610,219920,226879,even though i could get more shoes and i  could understand i could understand that  it really was because i was grounded
oQMViymb610,226879,232239,i've done the  was doing and continue to this day  to do
oQMViymb610,232239,237760,the consciousness work i work at staying  awake
oQMViymb610,237760,244959,the reason why i was number one for 25  years  is because i figured out early on
oQMViymb610,244959,251680,there is no story anybody has ever heard  that somebody else hasn't experienced
oQMViymb610,251680,257840,nothing  and i also figured out  probably maybe the first or second year
oQMViymb610,257840,262960,that all pain is the same  that a mother in somalia feels the same
oQMViymb610,262960,270400,way as a mother in seattle when she  loses her child  and the common denominator in the human
oQMViymb610,270400,276960,experience  is our emotions and our feelings and the  more vulnerable and open you are willing
oQMViymb610,276960,282560,to be with your story the more actual  understanding you create with other
oQMViymb610,282560,288720,people and the more powerful you become  people don't think less of you for  sharing your story they think more of
oQMViymb610,288720,296240,you for having the courage to share it  what inspired me was an is continues to
oQMViymb610,296240,302960,be what continues to inspire me  is a  primal and fundamental desire
oQMViymb610,302960,309840,to fulfill  the highest expression  of myself as a human
oQMViymb610,309840,316160,i don't want to die  not having  completely
oQMViymb610,316160,322720,burnt out  every  single possibility of my humanity
oQMViymb610,322720,328240,i just i just want to when when i leave  this planet i want everybody  did that
oQMViymb610,328240,335280,used it all up not another thing i could  do there wasn't another person i could  have given of myself to there wasn't
oQMViymb610,335280,342000,another deed i could have done there  wasn't anything that you just wanted you  want to say i want to fill it up you
oQMViymb610,342000,349120,want to take this whole human existence  which when you think about it godfrey is  really pretty damn miraculous it is it
oQMViymb610,349120,355680,is it is when you think about what it  means to be a human being on the planet  earth right now that's pretty awesome
oQMViymb610,355680,363280,so i just wanna i wanna i wanna take  that to the max i wanna say no need to  come back as a human
oQMViymb610,363280,370160,the day first day i went to school i was  in a classroom  by the time i was uh
oQMViymb610,370160,375919,you know six years old didn't go to  school i was six years old because i  lived my grandmother that time sure but  she had taught me how to read read the
oQMViymb610,375919,381759,bible bible stories  so i went into the classroom  knowing nicodemus
oQMViymb610,381759,387919,shadrach meshach and abednego  i could spell all of those words i  thought i was you know i was preaching
oQMViymb610,387919,394720,to the to my kindergarten teacher  so  she was like who is this girl so
oQMViymb610,394720,400720,i was never placed in an environment  where i was ever made to feel inferior i
oQMViymb610,400720,407120,always felt like i'm the smartest kid in  this room  and because i was never placed and never
oQMViymb610,407120,412240,put in a position where i was made to  feel  less than i didn't grow up feeling less
oQMViymb610,412240,418479,than you know  and the rest as they say is history and  the rest they say is history and it's  all about what you believe you know i
oQMViymb610,418479,424080,say this to  uh when i do something on my network now  call life class
oQMViymb610,424080,429599,the fundamental  key to success is what you believe
oQMViymb610,429599,435199,is true for yourself not what you want  not what you desire is what do you  believe
oQMViymb610,435199,441039,you know you can say i want to i want to  be the most successful person in the  world but if you believe that there's a  glass ceiling and you're going to have a
oQMViymb610,441039,446080,hard time kicking through that glass  ceiling  you will be defined by the glass ceiling
oQMViymb610,446080,452479,and  the great beauty and gift of my life is  that i was never defined by the box that
oQMViymb610,452479,458080,other people tried to put me in  [Music]  the energy of your intention
oQMViymb610,458080,463199,is what determines your life  most people don't think about their  intention they just think about what
oQMViymb610,463199,469599,they want to do  most people don't think about why they  want to do it  but what's going to come back to you the
oQMViymb610,469599,475039,energy that's going to come back to you  is the real why of why you did it
oQMViymb610,475039,482000,what drives you to keep working so hard  you could you know you and i are in the  60s category and so when you're in your
oQMViymb610,482000,487759,60s you know you've lived more than  you're going to live yeah realistically  so when you realize you've lived more  than you're going to live you can say
oQMViymb610,487759,493520,why not relax a little bit why not just  ease up why have you decided to even  work harder than you did before
oQMViymb610,493520,500240,because i think david that everybody you  know the thing that works for me  all these years whether it was the
oQMViymb610,500240,505280,magazine or  which i still have or whether it was the
oQMViymb610,505280,511280,show i could i understood that there's a  common denominator in the human  experience and i want the same thing you
oQMViymb610,511280,517680,want which is the same thing you want  and you want what we all want is to be  able to live out
oQMViymb610,517680,523360,the truest  highest expression of ourselves as a  human being
oQMViymb610,523360,528880,that doesn't end until you take your  last breath what is the truest  highest
oQMViymb610,528880,534560,vision that you hold for yourself no  matter where you are in your life  there's always the next level there's
oQMViymb610,534560,539680,always the next level to the last breath  so i feel that i always knew that i
oQMViymb610,539680,545600,would get be done with the show when i  felt like oh i've said as much as i  could say here
oQMViymb610,545600,552080,on this platform and then how will i be  used if there were if there were a theme  song to my life amazing grace would be
oQMViymb610,552080,557200,one of them  so i feel that until you have used your
oQMViymb610,557200,562959,value as a human being you're not done  my biggest frustration is not just with
oQMViymb610,562959,568000,young women my biggest frustration is  also with young men young people who
oQMViymb610,568000,574160,think  that and i have a lot of this with my  girls in college  they think
oQMViymb610,574160,581040,that success  is supposed to happen like that  yeah they think
oQMViymb610,581040,586800,that there isn't a process to it  they think that they're supposed to come
oQMViymb610,586800,594560,out of college and have their brand  and um  i recognize now that i am a brand but i
oQMViymb610,594560,601120,was resistant to being called a brand  for many years because i was like i'm a  brand i'm not a brand i'm a person but
oQMViymb610,601120,607040,how i got to be a brand was not trying  to be a brand how i got to be a brand  was every day
oQMViymb610,607040,612160,making choices that felt like this is  the right move now that's the right move
oQMViymb610,612160,617760,and now that's the next right move the  next right move and so my frustration  with young women and young men is that
oQMViymb610,617760,623760,they think it's supposed to happen like  this and they don't understand that  there's a process
oQMViymb610,625400,629220,[Music]
oQMViymb610,630480,637519,i always understood that there really  was no difference between me and the  audience  at times i might have had better shoes
oQMViymb610,637519,643360,but at the core  the core  of of what really matters
oQMViymb610,643360,649279,that we are the same and you know how i  know that because  all of us are seeking the same thing
oQMViymb610,649279,655200,you're here at this fabulous school  and will go out into the world and each
oQMViymb610,655200,662000,pursue based upon what you believe your  talents are  what your skills are maybe your gifts
oQMViymb610,662000,668320,are  but you're seeking the same thing  everybody wants to fulfill  the highest
oQMViymb610,668320,674399,truest  expression  of yourself  as a human being that's what you're
oQMViymb610,674399,681040,looking for  the highest  truest  expression of yourself as a human being
oQMViymb610,681040,687279,and because i understand that i  understand that if you're working in a  bakery  and that's where you want to be
oQMViymb610,687279,693040,and that may be that that may be what  you've always wanted to do is to bake  pies for people or bake cakes for people
oQMViymb610,693040,698079,or to offer your gift then then that's  that's for you and there's no difference
oQMViymb610,698079,704800,between you and me except that's how  that's your platform that's your show  every day so my understanding of that
oQMViymb610,704800,711440,has allowed me to you know everyone to  reach everyone and and there's no way  that you wouldn't because that's that's
oQMViymb610,711440,716480,what i truly feel the way through the  challenge
oQMViymb610,716480,721519,is to get still  and ask yourself what is the next right
oQMViymb610,721519,727600,move  not think about oh i got all of this  stuff what is the next right move and
oQMViymb610,727600,732639,then from that space make the next right  move and the next right move and not to
oQMViymb610,732639,739360,be overwhelmed by it because you know  your life is bigger than that one moment  you know you're not defined by what
oQMViymb610,739360,746160,somebody says is a failure for you  because failure is just there to point  you in a different direction
oQMViymb610,746160,752560,if i leave you with nothing else it's  just know this for sure  there is not one
oQMViymb610,752560,758560,thing  that has ever happened to you  not one experience
oQMViymb610,758560,764639,not one encounter not one crisis not one  joyful thing that hasn't
oQMViymb610,764639,770720,happened  just to make you better and help you  rise
oQMViymb610,770720,776959,every single thing you're calling in  whether you know it or not when you  figure out that you are calling it in
oQMViymb610,776959,782320,when you actually start meditating or  praying or doing or having a spiritual  practice which is the number one thing
oQMViymb610,782320,789279,you need if you want to be successful in  the world you need something that gives  back and nourishes you
oQMViymb610,789279,796320,regardless of what you call that you  need to you need to fill your cup so  that you can be so full your cup runneth
oQMViymb610,796320,802560,over and you have enough to give to  other people if you don't fill your cup  you end up dried up
oQMViymb610,802560,808079,you end up tired exhausted and don't  have enough to give to other people you  end up resentful every time somebody
oQMViymb610,808079,816880,asks you because your cup is empty and  now they want some of yours  [Music]  so your number one job your number one
oQMViymb610,816880,825120,job is to fill  your cup and make yourself whole
oQMViymb610,825120,831839,so for me the foundational base of  empowerment of entrepreneurship
oQMViymb610,831839,837680,of any kind of engagement the  foundational base of my success
oQMViymb610,837680,846720,of my well-being my wholeness my  everything  is knowing who i am and where i come
oQMViymb610,846720,853279,from  [Applause]  in my living room right now
oQMViymb610,853279,858639,is a painting that i've owned now for 30  years  you can google it
oQMViymb610,858639,864160,it's called to the highest bidder  and it's at the center of my house
oQMViymb610,864160,869920,and it's at the center of my house  because it actually is symbolic of the  foundation of not the house but the
oQMViymb610,869920,877440,foundation for my life the painting is  by harry rosalind who was a genre  painter painter in the
oQMViymb610,877440,882639,early 20th late 19th century  and the painting is over six feet tall
oQMViymb610,882639,889839,and it shows a slave woman  on the auction block  holding her daughter's hand
oQMViymb610,889839,895600,and i cannot come in the door my front  door or i cannot leave without passing
oQMViymb610,895600,900959,that painting i am reminded of where i  come from every day of my life and i am
oQMViymb610,900959,906800,reminded because i never want to forget  it  and in my library
oQMViymb610,906800,913040,i have a framed list of enslaved  african-american people remember i  showed you
oQMViymb610,913040,920160,who were held in bondage on various  plantations  listed in the ledgers alongside
oQMViymb610,920160,927040,the cows  and the horses  and the buggies  and the other property and i pass this
oQMViymb610,927040,934000,list every day  and often i stop in front of it and just  speak their names
oQMViymb610,934000,942880,out loud and their ages  jonas  11 years old 500
oQMViymb610,942880,949440,sarah  41 years old  900
oQMViymb610,949440,955360,elizabeth  57  eight hundred dollars
oQMViymb610,955360,961600,and i force myself to consider  the absurdity and the obscenity
oQMViymb610,961600,968240,of prices being affixed to each one  should they be placed up for sale
oQMViymb610,968240,973839,and i sometimes just pause before them  with a prayer  particularly before i have to make a big
oQMViymb610,973839,979360,decision about  one of my companies or  whether i move forward or whether i stay
oQMViymb610,979360,984480,still  it reminds me speaking those names out  loud
oQMViymb610,984480,990320,not only of where i've come from  but how far  i have to go
oQMViymb610,990320,995839,because of them  and it reminds me that i am never alone
oQMViymb610,995839,1001120,it reminds me of what i've come through  to get through
oQMViymb610,1001120,1007600,i say to the my girls  all of the time that your real work
oQMViymb610,1007600,1013680,is to figure out where your power base  is
oQMViymb610,1013680,1021120,and to work on the alignment of your  personality your gifts that you have to
oQMViymb610,1021120,1027120,give with the real reason why you're  here that's that's the number one thing  you have to do
oQMViymb610,1027120,1032640,is to work on yourself and to fill your  self  up
oQMViymb610,1032640,1038798,and keep your cup full keep yourself  full now i used to be afraid of that
oQMViymb610,1038798,1046319,i used to be afraid particularly from  people who say oh she said she's still  fella  she's so close herself and now
oQMViymb610,1046319,1053600,i embrace it  i i consider it a compliment that i am  full of myself
oQMViymb610,1053600,1059520,because you only when you're full i'm  full i'm overflowing my cup run is over
oQMViymb610,1059520,1064880,i have so much i have so much to offer  and so much to give and i am not afraid
oQMViymb610,1064880,1072240,of honoring myself you know it's  miraculous when you think about it
oQMViymb610,1072320,1077679,everybody has a different talent  and the reason we're all so messed up is
oQMViymb610,1077679,1083919,because you're looking at everybody  else's talent  and wishing you had some of their talent
oQMViymb610,1083919,1090559,all the energy that you spend thinking  about wishing about being jealous of  envious of anybody else is energy that
oQMViymb610,1090559,1096559,you're not only putting out is going to  come back to you negatively but you're  taking that away from you
oQMViymb610,1096559,1102000,all your energy should be forced on what  do i have to offer what do i have to
oQMViymb610,1102000,1108320,give how can i be used in service  because dr king's message of not
oQMViymb610,1108320,1113440,everybody can be famous but everybody  can be great because greatness is
oQMViymb610,1113440,1119120,determined by service and there is not a  job in here that you can do that you
oQMViymb610,1119120,1124559,don't switch the paradigm to service and  not make that job more fulfilling i
oQMViymb610,1124559,1131440,don't care what the job is if you say  i'm a singer i'm a dancer i'm an artist  i'm a teacher i'm a nurse i'm a doctor
oQMViymb610,1131440,1139520,i'm a janitor i'm a i'm a clerk  if you say if i look at this from how do  i use this in service to something
oQMViymb610,1139520,1144720,bigger than myself  it no longer becomes a job it becomes an
oQMViymb610,1144720,1150960,offering to the world  the first law is  the third law of motion in physics which
oQMViymb610,1150960,1157360,says for every action there's an equal  and opposite reaction and we showed that  very beautifully in the color purple
oQMViymb610,1157360,1163280,when messily says to mister everything  you even try to do to me is already done
oQMViymb610,1163280,1169600,to you  that is not just a rhetorical saying  that is law that is newton's third law
oQMViymb610,1169600,1175039,of motion  in physics which says everything that  goes out
oQMViymb610,1175039,1183840,is coming back it's just like everything  that goes up is coming down may take a  long time to come down it's coming down
oQMViymb610,1183840,1190400,everything that goes out is coming back  it's coming back so  to answer the power of manifestation and
oQMViymb610,1190400,1198240,meditation what meditation does is sync  you up with the source  what meditation does is allows you to
oQMViymb610,1198240,1205039,literally tap into the power that  created you so that you are in alignment
oQMViymb610,1205039,1211520,with that  and so when you carry that out into the  world everything that you do
oQMViymb610,1211520,1218559,comes from the center of that alignment  that's coming from the source that we  call god we call divine energy divine
oQMViymb610,1218559,1224720,intelligence whatever name you want to  give it we call life when you are synced  up with life
oQMViymb610,1224720,1232080,life just gives to you  [Music]
oQMViymb610,1232080,1238159,the number one lesson i could offer you  where your work is concerned is this  become so skilled
oQMViymb610,1238159,1243280,so vigilant so flat out fantastic
oQMViymb610,1243280,1250559,at what you do  that your talent cannot be dismissed
oQMViymb610,1253039,1258960,you know when i was a kid i thought i  was going to uh  be a social worker or be a teacher or
oQMViymb610,1258960,1266559,somehow be in an environment where i  would be connected and speaking to  people to honor that calling i had no
oQMViymb610,1266559,1272880,idea that god could dream this big dream  of  a television life for myself but
oQMViymb610,1272880,1278400,everybody has a calling  and your real job in life is to figure
oQMViymb610,1278400,1283520,out as soon as possible what that is  who you were meant to be
oQMViymb610,1283520,1289760,and begin to honor that in the best way  possible for yourself we have seen over
oQMViymb610,1289760,1296159,the years on the oprah show so many  people who've been able to rise to  success in their life and only able to
oQMViymb610,1296159,1303600,rise to success because they answered  the call lots of people think that it's  about being famous or about being known
oQMViymb610,1303600,1309120,or about doing big big incredible things  what you're going to hear today and see
oQMViymb610,1309120,1314240,through the stories  is that  sometimes the calling is
oQMViymb610,1314240,1320000,right in your own neighborhood sometimes  the calling is  something that
oQMViymb610,1320000,1325520,was just a whisper to you and when you  begin to honor that whisper
oQMViymb610,1325520,1330960,and to follow that  you end up being the best that you could  be
oQMViymb610,1330960,1336559,i actually thought at the time  that being thin  uh
oQMViymb610,1336559,1342080,made me better  uh my identification with form my  uh
oQMViymb610,1342080,1347440,wanting so  desperately to be in a size 10 gene was  so prominent
oQMViymb610,1347440,1354960,identifying with that that shortly after  this i gained five pounds  and i was invited to a party at the time
oQMViymb610,1354960,1362720,by don johnson remember dreamy dawn  johnson i was invited to a holiday party  and i did not go to that party because i
oQMViymb610,1362720,1369039,thought the five pounds  made me too fat  not good enough to be a don johnson's
oQMViymb610,1369039,1374640,party sounds kind of sick now i know  but that's what the ego does it is uh
oQMViymb610,1374640,1380400,it's just it is sick it's wily it's  cunning it's deceptive it's an imposter
oQMViymb610,1380400,1387360,imposing on the real you  making you often think that you're  something that you're not
oQMViymb610,1387360,1394720,you're not the shape of your body  you're not your status  you're not your position in life you're
oQMViymb610,1394720,1400880,not the car you drive no matter how  fancy it is you're not  your house or your square footage for
oQMViymb610,1400880,1407440,all of you watching right now here's  another way to better understand ego  what i'm talking about eckhart taught me
oQMViymb610,1407440,1414080,this everybody try this from home where  or wherever you are right now close your  eyes
oQMViymb610,1414080,1421039,and  notice what you're thinking  notice your thoughts
oQMViymb610,1421039,1426720,now  who is thinking those thoughts
oQMViymb610,1426720,1432960,can you notice that there is a space  where you are observing the thoughts
oQMViymb610,1432960,1439279,and where you are aware of the thoughts  that you were observing  eckhart says you are that awareness
oQMViymb610,1439279,1444640,disguised as a person  and when i got that
oQMViymb610,1444640,1452320,i understood the difference between my  true self  and my ego self
oQMViymb610,1452559,1459440,over the years we've heard invaluable  information  that in a moment of danger could be
oQMViymb610,1459440,1465919,life-saving  nothing i heard made a greater  impression on me than back in 1991 i
oQMViymb610,1465919,1471440,think we were beginning our fifth season  and a man named sanford strong came on
oQMViymb610,1471440,1477360,and shared this never forgot it rule  number one  and frankly it's probably in my opinion
oQMViymb610,1477360,1484000,the most important  never  allow them  to take you somewhere else
oQMViymb610,1484000,1489279,never  if everyone in this room and everyone  watching this program has never drawn
oQMViymb610,1489279,1495600,the line  and made a decision  on crime protection  you better make it when they decide to
oQMViymb610,1495600,1500720,move you from crime scene number one to  crime scene number two because the crime  scene number two it's going to be
oQMViymb610,1500720,1506559,isolated you won't choose it you'll be  the focus of the crime  i think what was so
oQMViymb610,1506559,1512159,interesting about that piece of advice  is at the time that we all heard that
oQMViymb610,1512159,1518880,we had been trained as women people  especially to believe that you just do  whatever they say whatever they say go
oQMViymb610,1518880,1524080,along with it and what's important for  those of you who are watching right now
oQMViymb610,1524080,1531760,and  those of you who are on the internet  with us right now to know is that it's  all about using your gut in the moment
oQMViymb610,1531760,1538720,and people who've survived horrific  circumstances talk about listening to  that intuition and every move being made
oQMViymb610,1538720,1546400,calculated on listening to what your gut  says  what the experts now say is do not allow
oQMViymb610,1546400,1552240,yourself to be taken to the second  location because anybody who is trying
oQMViymb610,1552240,1557679,to harm you  wants to get you to an isolated place  where they can do that without other
oQMViymb610,1557679,1563919,people seeing or knowing it so in that  moment of making the decision oh you're  going to shoot me if you're going to
oQMViymb610,1563919,1569120,shoot me  you have to shoot me now  rather than shoot me in isolation where
oQMViymb610,1569120,1576720,nobody can see you whenever somebody has  said something that made the little  hairs on my arms or neck stand up i know
oQMViymb610,1576720,1583360,that if that's happening to me that's  also happening to somebody else too  the way to make movies is to do stuff
oQMViymb610,1583360,1588559,that you love because you know for 25  years i worked on the oprah show  and
oQMViymb610,1588559,1594799,uh steven will tell you that there were  nights that i came home and i almost you  know it's hard to even like take off my
oQMViymb610,1594799,1601600,clothes because i knew i was going to be  getting up four hours later but i never  really felt exhausted
oQMViymb610,1601600,1606640,like depl never i felt exhausted but i  never felt depleted so do the work that
oQMViymb610,1606640,1613120,comes straight from  the soul of you from your background  from stories that you've grown up with
oQMViymb610,1613120,1618480,from stories that bring you passion from  stories that you uh not just yearn to
oQMViymb610,1618480,1623840,tell  but that if you don't tell them they  won't get told and when you when you are
oQMViymb610,1623840,1630320,operating you know the single the single  greatest uh  wisdom i think i've ever received other
oQMViymb610,1630320,1637360,than when people show who they are is  that  the key to fulfillment success
oQMViymb610,1637360,1643039,happiness  contentment in life  is when you align
oQMViymb610,1643039,1649919,your personality  with what your soul actually came to do  i believe everybody has a soul and has
oQMViymb610,1649919,1658000,you know their own personal  spiritual energy so when you can use  your personality to serve whatever that
oQMViymb610,1658000,1664640,thing is  you can't help but be successful so if  you do films that come from the interior
oQMViymb610,1664640,1669840,of your soul you do work you do art that  comes from the interior of you
oQMViymb610,1669840,1676080,it you cannot miss  it's only when you're doing stuff that  you think might make money you think it
oQMViymb610,1676080,1682799,may be  a  hit or you think it may  uh bring you some level of attention or
oQMViymb610,1682799,1689039,success that isn't what does it i would  have to say that all of the great  wonderful experiences of my life that
oQMViymb610,1689039,1695039,have brought me to this moment have come  from working from the interior of myself
oQMViymb610,1695039,1700720,and so that's why it feels so authentic  because it  it actually is
oQMViymb610,1700720,1706320,so when you do that you'll win  and everybody has a different talent
oQMViymb610,1706320,1712399,and the reason we're all so messed up is  because you're looking at everybody  else's talent
oQMViymb610,1712399,1717440,and wishing you had some of their talent  all the energy that you spend thinking
oQMViymb610,1717440,1723679,about wishing about being jealous of  envious of anybody else is energy that  you're not only putting out is going to
oQMViymb610,1723679,1730399,come back to you negatively but you're  taking that away from you  all your energy should be forced on what
oQMViymb610,1730399,1736960,do i have to offer what do i have to  give how can i be used in service
oQMViymb610,1736960,1742799,because dr king's message of not  everybody can be famous but everybody
oQMViymb610,1742799,1750559,can be great because greatness is  determined by service and there is not a  job in here that you can do that you
oQMViymb610,1750559,1756000,don't switch the paradigm to service  and not make that job more fulfilling i
oQMViymb610,1756000,1762880,don't care what the job is if you say  i'm a singer i'm a dancer i'm an artist  i'm a teacher i'm a nurse i'm a doctor
oQMViymb610,1762880,1767919,i'm a janitor i'm a i'm a clerk about if  you say if i look at this from how do i
oQMViymb610,1767919,1773520,use this in service to something bigger  than myself
oQMViymb610,1773520,1778559,it no longer becomes a job it becomes an  offering to the world i first started
oQMViymb610,1778559,1784000,making money and it was you know my  salary  or my earnings
oQMViymb610,1784000,1792159,were  published all over the place i mean the  first year i was like really did i make  that much money oh my god
oQMViymb610,1792320,1799279,it was very difficult for me to figure  out where my boundaries were  because i'd grown up poor and didn't
oQMViymb610,1799279,1805440,have anything  so it's easy when you don't have  anything and people ask you for money  and they say i need 500 you say i don't
oQMViymb610,1805440,1812559,have it because i'm just trying to get  my rent paid  it's harder when your
oQMViymb610,1812559,1819760,multi-billion dollar salary is now in  the paper and you get a lot of friends  and cousins you didn't have before
oQMViymb610,1819760,1825360,so how do you set  boundaries for yourself i was having  trouble setting boundaries myself for
oQMViymb610,1825360,1832640,myself for even strangers people would  just show up at my door in chicago and  say oh bro i left my husband please help
oQMViymb610,1832640,1839760,me  and i would because  she knows i have it  so what i learned was is that
oQMViymb610,1839760,1846399,oh the reason why people keep showing up  is because my intention is to make them  think that i'm such a nice person
oQMViymb610,1846399,1852399,that  you can ask me for anything  you can get me to do anything i'm going
oQMViymb610,1852399,1857600,to say yes i'm going to say yes so when  stevie called me this time i thought i'd
oQMViymb610,1857600,1864000,try out my first no on stevie let's  start big  he wanted me to donate some money to a
oQMViymb610,1864000,1870559,charity and i didn't want to donate to  the charity  because  i have my own charities and i care about
oQMViymb610,1870559,1875840,a lot of people but the the problem is  when you you have money everybody thinks  you just want to give to everything so
oQMViymb610,1875840,1882159,every letter i ever get starts with we  know you love the children  [Music]
oQMViymb610,1882159,1887279,yes i do love the children but somebody  else is going to have to help the  children
oQMViymb610,1887279,1893760,so i said to stevie uh i said to stevie  no  um
oQMViymb610,1893760,1902080,as a person who has that disease to  please i was waiting for him then just  to say  i will never speak to you again
oQMViymb610,1902080,1910000,i will never call you i will never sing  a song for you  and he didn't he just said okay
oQMViymb610,1910000,1916159,okay  okay it's okay he said okay check you  later
oQMViymb610,1916159,1923440,and  what i learned from that is  many times you will have angst and worry
oQMViymb610,1923440,1929679,about things  and  put yourself in a state like someone  said this morning because their phone
oQMViymb610,1929679,1935600,went off they were mortified over a  phone i said really  you will put yourself in a state when
oQMViymb610,1935600,1940720,the other person really isn't even  thinking about you  so
oQMViymb610,1940720,1948399,learning that i could specifically  determine for myself what the boundaries
oQMViymb610,1948399,1955919,were for me  what i wanted to do  give my money give my time give of my
oQMViymb610,1955919,1962480,service to who i wanted to give it to  when i did that i get to make that  decision and just because you get a
oQMViymb610,1962480,1967760,hundred requests a week doesn't mean you  have to try to fulfill all of that just
oQMViymb610,1967760,1973760,because you have all of these demands on  your time and on you doesn't mean that
oQMViymb610,1973760,1979840,you  have to say yes you get to decide  because you're the master of your fate
oQMViymb610,1979840,1987679,the captain of your soul as william  ernest henley said in invictus and  understanding that really changed the
oQMViymb610,1987679,1993519,meaning of my life in that i was not  no longer driven by what
oQMViymb610,1993519,1999200,other people wanted me to do  but took charge of my own destiny making
oQMViymb610,1999200,2006559,choices based upon what do i feel  is the next right move for me
oQMViymb610,2006559,2011760,there was one woman out of all the  celebrities out of all of the

oQMViymb610,2194560,2200160,fine we're going to find that woman  terror right trend this time by this  time she's living in the united states
oQMViymb610,2200160,2207359,we followed her back to zimbabwe to the  rock  we pulled the tin can from underneath
oQMViymb610,2207359,2212400,the rock  and that is my favorite guest of all  time and the worst  um
oQMViymb610,2212400,2218560,i don't have a worst i don't have a  worse but the reason why she and as i  said this on my show the reason why tara
oQMViymb610,2218560,2224480,rai trent is my favorite guest of all  time is because she represents in that
oQMViymb610,2224480,2229680,one story of the little girl in a  village in zimbabwe who had a dream
oQMViymb610,2229680,2235680,and the heart and depth and discipline  to pursue it she represents everything i
oQMViymb610,2235680,2241599,tried to say in every show in 25 years  she literally through her life story
oQMViymb610,2241599,2247680,sums up the message that i was trying to  give to every single one of my viewers  you can
oQMViymb610,2247680,2254480,you can  keep trying  don't give up you have to believe you  have to believe
oQMViymb610,2254480,2259760,over the years the century so many  teachers and poets and songwriters have
oQMViymb610,2259760,2265200,talked about the significance of knowing  yourself i know we've all heard to thine
oQMViymb610,2265200,2271200,own self be true shakespeare or  learning to love yourself is the
oQMViymb610,2271200,2277520,greatest love of all whitney houston  what i know for sure is  that in all the talk about loving
oQMViymb610,2277520,2283920,yourself you can't begin to love  yourself or even be true to yourself
oQMViymb610,2283920,2290720,unless you know  who  you are  separate from your ego
oQMViymb610,2290720,2296400,so think about this for a moment you're  at home listening watching me and taking  in the thoughts that i'm sharing right
oQMViymb610,2296400,2302480,now  and  there is an inner space that allows you  to perceive these thoughts
oQMViymb610,2302480,2308560,little not even a space i'm just using  the word space because there is no other  word there is
oQMViymb610,2308560,2315920,the  ability to perceive what i'm saying  and be aware of what i'm saying
oQMViymb610,2315920,2321680,that is where the true you abides in  that awareness in the very center of  yourself
oQMViymb610,2321680,2326880,and when you stray from that center you  get lost  and you make mistakes
oQMViymb610,2326880,2333200,i learned this the hard way your ego  takes over  everybody has an ego i used to think the
oQMViymb610,2333200,2339280,ego showed itself through um  someone being arrogant or
oQMViymb610,2339280,2345680,stuck up or haughty  or the who does she think she is  printing down a red carpet kind of thing
oQMViymb610,2345680,2352000,well  i'm in show business in the business of  showing myself  so i'm aware that there's a lot of
oQMViymb610,2352000,2357280,egotism involved in this business and i  always thought that i
oQMViymb610,2357280,2363920,had my ego in check until i realized  that it's not just the obvious it's not
oQMViymb610,2363920,2369359,always acting out or showing off  in 2008
oQMViymb610,2369359,2374800,i chose eckhart tolle's book a new earth  for my book club and this book will  change the way
oQMViymb610,2374800,2379920,you view your life and the people around  you and your world chapters three and
oQMViymb610,2379920,2385599,four literally changed the way i saw  myself and my ego
oQMViymb610,2385599,2391320,it changed for me what ego meant  and totally says that's any
oQMViymb610,2391320,2398880,identification with form  meaning any identification identifying
oQMViymb610,2398880,2404960,with something that is not the center of  yourself that is possessions material  things cars
oQMViymb610,2404960,2412720,titles social status or in my case  identifying with the deep desire to be
oQMViymb610,2412720,2418400,thin  you will find true success and happiness
oQMViymb610,2418400,2423760,if you have only one goal there really  is only one and that is this
oQMViymb610,2423760,2429359,fulfill  the highest  most truthful  expression
oQMViymb610,2429359,2436240,of yourself  as a human being  you want to max out your humanity
oQMViymb610,2436240,2442400,by using your energy to lift yourself up  your family and the people around you
oQMViymb610,2442400,2449119,theologian howard thurman said it best  he said don't ask yourself what the  world needs
oQMViymb610,2449119,2456800,ask yourself what makes you come alive  and then go do that  because what the world needs is people
oQMViymb610,2456800,2462470,who have come alive  the world needs  [Applause]
oQMViymb610,2462470,2469040,[Music]  people like michael stahlzenberg from  fort lauderdale when michael was just
oQMViymb610,2469040,2476000,eight years old michael nearly died from  a bacterial infection that cost him both  of his hands and both of his feet
oQMViymb610,2476000,2481200,and in an instant this vibrant little  boy became a quadruple amputee
oQMViymb610,2481200,2488400,and his life  was changed forever  but in losing who he once was
oQMViymb610,2488400,2493760,michael discovered who he wanted to be  he refused to sit in that wheelchair all
oQMViymb610,2493760,2499040,day and feel sorry for himself so with  prosthetics he learned to walk
oQMViymb610,2499040,2506240,and run and play again  he joined his middle school lacrosse  team and last month when he learned that
oQMViymb610,2506240,2511280,so many victims of the boston marathon  bombing would become new amputees
oQMViymb610,2511280,2517599,michael decided to banish that darkness  with light  michael and his brother harris created
oQMViymb610,2517599,2523200,mikeysrun.com  to raise one million dollars for other  amputees
oQMViymb610,2523200,2529760,by the time harris runs the 2014 boston  marathon  more than a thousand miles away from
oQMViymb610,2529760,2535119,here  these two young brothers  are bringing people together to support
oQMViymb610,2535119,2540480,this boston community the way their  community came together to support
oQMViymb610,2540480,2548560,michael  and when this 13 year old man was asked  about his fellow amputees he said this
oQMViymb610,2548839,2556480,first they will be sad  they're losing something  they will never get back
oQMViymb610,2556480,2561760,and that's scary  i was scared
oQMViymb610,2561760,2567280,but they'll be  okay they just don't know that yet
oQMViymb610,2567280,2572480,we might not always know it  we might not always see it or hear it
oQMViymb610,2572480,2577680,on the news  or even feel it in our daily lives but i  have faith
oQMViymb610,2577680,2584160,that  no matter what  class of 2013
oQMViymb610,2584160,2590000,you will be okay  and you will make sure our country is  okay
oQMViymb610,2590000,2596000,i have faith because of that  nine-year-old girl who went out and  collected the change  i have faith because of david and
oQMViymb610,2596000,2603760,francine wheeler i have faith because of  michael and harris stolzenberg and i  have faith because of you the network of
oQMViymb610,2603760,2608960,angels sitting here today one of them  khadijah williams who came to harvard
oQMViymb610,2608960,2616800,four years ago  khadijah had attended 12 schools in 12
oQMViymb610,2616800,2623200,years  living out of garbage bags amongst pimps  and prostitutes and drug dealers
oQMViymb610,2623200,2628960,homeless  going into department stores walmart in  the morning to bathe herself so that she
oQMViymb610,2628960,2635040,wouldn't smell in front of her  classmates  and today she graduates as a member of  the harvard class
oQMViymb610,2635040,2641200,of 2013. nobody's journey is seamless or  smooth we all stumble we all have
oQMViymb610,2641200,2647280,setbacks if things go wrong you hit a  dead end as you will
oQMViymb610,2647280,2656160,it's just life's way of saying  time to change course  so ask every failure this is what i do
oQMViymb610,2656160,2661599,every failure every crisis every  difficult time i say what is this here
oQMViymb610,2661599,2667119,to teach me  and as soon as you get the lesson  you get to move on
oQMViymb610,2667119,2672240,if you really get the lesson you pass  and you don't have to repeat the class  if you don't get the lesson it shows up
oQMViymb610,2672240,2679680,wearing another pair of pants  or skirt  to give you some remedial work
oQMViymb610,2679680,2686079,and what i found is that difficulties  come when you don't pay attention to  life's whisper
oQMViymb610,2686079,2691760,because life always whispers to you  first first and if you ignore the  whisper sooner or later you'll get a
oQMViymb610,2691760,2697200,scream  whatever you resist persists but if you  ask the right question not why is this
oQMViymb610,2697200,2702800,happening but what is this here to teach  me what is this here to teach me it puts
oQMViymb610,2702800,2709839,you in the place and space to get the  lesson you need my friend cartoli  uh who's written this wonderful book
oQMViymb610,2709839,2715680,uh called a new earth  that's all about letting the awareness  of who you are stimulate everything that
oQMViymb610,2715680,2721200,you do he puts it like this he says  don't react against a bad situation
oQMViymb610,2721200,2727119,merge with that situation instead and  the solution will arise from the  challenge
oQMViymb610,2727119,2733359,because surrendering yourself doesn't  mean giving up it means acting with  responsibility
oQMViymb610,2733359,2739680,okay  many of you know that as president  hennessey said i started this school
oQMViymb610,2739680,2746319,in africa  and  i founded the school where i'm trying to  give south african girls a shot at a
oQMViymb610,2746319,2753200,future like yours stanford  and i spent five years making sure that
oQMViymb610,2753200,2760319,school would be as beautiful as the  students  i wanted every girl to feel her worth
oQMViymb610,2760319,2766800,reflected in her surroundings so i  checked every blueprint  i picked every pillow
oQMViymb610,2766800,2773440,i was looking at the grout in between  the bricks i knew every thread count of  the sheets i chose every girl from the
oQMViymb610,2773440,2779359,villages from nine provinces and yet  last fall i was faced with a crisis i'd
oQMViymb610,2779359,2785599,never anticipated i was told that one of  the dorm matrons was suspected of sexual  abuse
oQMViymb610,2785599,2791680,well that was as you can imagine  devastating news  first i cried actually i sobbed for
oQMViymb610,2791680,2798000,about a half an hour  and then i said let's get to it  that's all you get is a half an hour
oQMViymb610,2798000,2805359,you need to focus on the now  what you need to do now so i contacted a  child trauma specialist i put together a
oQMViymb610,2805359,2810640,team of investigators i made sure the  girls had counseling and support and
oQMViymb610,2810640,2817200,gail and i got on a plane and flew to  south africa and the whole time i kept  asking that question
oQMViymb610,2817200,2822960,what is this here to teach me  and as difficult as that experience has  been
oQMViymb610,2822960,2828960,i got a lot of lessons  i understand now the mistakes i made  because i
oQMViymb610,2828960,2837040,had been paying attention to all of the  wrong things  i built that school from the outside in
oQMViymb610,2837040,2842800,when what really mattered was the inside  out  so it's a lesson that applies to all of
oQMViymb610,2842800,2848960,our lives as a whole what matters most  is what's inside what matters most is  the sense of
oQMViymb610,2848960,2854640,integrity of quality and beauty i got  that lesson and what i know is is that
oQMViymb610,2854640,2859839,the girls came away with something too  they've emerged from this more resilient
oQMViymb610,2859839,2864960,and knowing that their voices  have power  [Music]
oQMViymb610,2864960,2870880,there's a bigger dream waiting for you  just waiting  for you
oQMViymb610,2870880,2877359,to step into it  to step into it your life is big
oQMViymb610,2877359,2886640,your life is huge and we spend so much  time  wanting to be in somebody else's life
oQMViymb610,2886640,2894319,and you don't get honored  you don't get revered you don't get  celebrating wanting what somebody else
oQMViymb610,2894319,2899520,has  [Music]
oQMViymb610,2899520,2904640,because  that which created you divine
oQMViymb610,2904640,2911280,intelligence that dreamed you from  before your ancestors ever knew
oQMViymb610,2911280,2916400,they would become  your ancestors that which dream the seed
oQMViymb610,2916400,2921440,of you  wants you to know how special how
oQMViymb610,2921440,2928559,wondrous how mysterious how complex how  glorious how phenomenal you are
oQMViymb610,2928559,2936400,and you get no credit  messing in somebody else's territory  [Music]
oQMViymb610,2936400,2942559,or trying to have  power  over something you have no control
oQMViymb610,2942559,2947839,another one of my favorite teachings is  the wizard of oz  when the wicked which is the west says
oQMViymb610,2947839,2954839,go away from here because you don't have  any power here you have no power in any  territory other than your
oQMViymb610,2954839,2962480,own oh but you are the master of that  you get to be the master of your own
oQMViymb610,2962480,2969040,fate you get to be the captain of your  own soul and if you just manage that
oQMViymb610,2969040,2975200,if you just took care of your territory  all the glorious glorious glorious
oQMViymb610,2975200,2982400,wondrous  wondrous opportunities and possibilities  that are waiting for you so the question
oQMViymb610,2982400,2987760,is what are you resisting  what are you pushing against
oQMViymb610,2987760,2994480,what are you not allowing what are you  blocking because you have this idea of
oQMViymb610,2994480,3002160,who and what you're supposed to be  instead of  leaning into the dream that's already
oQMViymb610,3002160,3007920,been created and waiting for you it's  waiting for you and the second i mean it
oQMViymb610,3007920,3014720,doesn't it's an instant thing it's a  shift in the way you see yourself and
oQMViymb610,3014720,3019480,the power from which you have come
oQMViymb610,3020380,3023619,[Music]
oQMViymb610,3027119,3034240,practicing gratitude it is my single  most  important life practice i'd have to say
oQMViymb610,3034240,3039599,and i know with thanksgiving coming many  people think about being thankful  there's lots to talk about
oQMViymb610,3039599,3046079,thanksgiving and blessings but  that's kind of like going to church on  just christmas and easter it counts but
oQMViymb610,3046079,3053200,it's not consistent because for me  gratitude is something that  is necessary and should be practiced
oQMViymb610,3053200,3059119,every day because making space for  appreciating what you have  opens you up for a happier more
oQMViymb610,3059119,3064319,fulfilled existence i guarantee while  ensuring that those blessings just keep
oQMViymb610,3064319,3071760,flowing this is the truth it's a law  what you focus on in your life expands  so focusing on what you're grateful for
oQMViymb610,3071760,3077040,increases positive vibrations and  feelings of joy just one good feeling
oQMViymb610,3077040,3084559,builds on another good feeling and  another and if you actively appreciate  all that you have in life no matter how
oQMViymb610,3084559,3090559,small it is what you  notice is that you end up having more  and when you hone in on what you don't
oQMViymb610,3090559,3097599,have you never have enough so being  grateful i've learned allows us to fill  in the cracks and crevices between what
oQMViymb610,3097599,3103760,we desire and what we already have with  positivity so we can pave the way for
oQMViymb610,3103760,3110000,grace  to show up and lead to an even better  life so how do you make gratitude a
oQMViymb610,3110000,3115040,habit for me  the first thing i do in the morning is i  read some sort of spiritual
oQMViymb610,3115040,3120800,enlightenment that allows me to start  the day with a positive frame of mind  that will only
oQMViymb610,3120800,3128240,help usher in even more positive energy  and for me that is the daily word which  is christian based or the book of psalms
oQMViymb610,3128240,3133599,also christian mark nepo's book of  awakening is just spiritual no religion
oQMViymb610,3133599,3140800,with a daily meditation  and rumi or mary oliver there's  something called bowl of sake that i
oQMViymb610,3140800,3146160,love too it's a spiritual sufi teachings  that you can download for free into your
oQMViymb610,3146160,3152079,inbox but the greatest thing that i've  ever done  is having a gratitude journal so i
oQMViymb610,3152079,3158160,started one over 20 years ago and every  day for years now i write down five
oQMViymb610,3158160,3166160,things that i am grateful for i believe  you gotta write them down because there  is power power power in the written word
oQMViymb610,3166160,3172720,and it can be anything big or small some  days those things will come easy  you know a chat with a close friend or
oQMViymb610,3172720,3177839,taking a walk in the crisp fall air  having a loved one cook you at dinner or  bring you a
oQMViymb610,3177839,3184240,cup of tea some days it might be  difficult to even think of anything  and that's completely normal and when
oQMViymb610,3184240,3190960,things don't easily come to mind  go back to your breath  because if you breathe in you ought to
oQMViymb610,3190960,3196400,be grateful  know that you have that and simply  opening your eyes in the morning and
oQMViymb610,3196400,3202319,having that breath is a gift  but every day i consistently write down
oQMViymb610,3202319,3208000,five things that i'm grateful for  sometimes it's more than five but if i  can't get to five i just go breath
oQMViymb610,3208000,3213359,breath breath  gratitude is a posture
oQMViymb610,3213359,3219680,of your heart  a choice and a privilege so i hope that  you'll make the choice to initiate a
oQMViymb610,3219680,3226480,daily gratitude practice if you haven't  already i've been saying it for years  because this i know for sure sure
oQMViymb610,3226480,3232880,appreciating noting the delights that  show up in your life  will ensure more goodness is coming your
oQMViymb610,3232880,3238559,way  after a year like nobody has ever  experienced i believe that the best
oQMViymb610,3238559,3244400,thing we can collectively do is to take  care of our individual cells now i know
oQMViymb610,3244400,3249599,that might sound oversimplified and even  selfish to some people but this is what
oQMViymb610,3249599,3255599,i know for sure that you have to feed  yourself with love and loving thoughts  in order to show up
oQMViymb610,3255599,3261040,more fortified and complete  to give other people your love we hear
oQMViymb610,3261040,3268480,about self-care so much these days but  what does it really mean well for me  it's about engaging in practices that
oQMViymb610,3268480,3275839,fill you up in every way that means  eating foods that are both enjoyable and  nourishing giving your body the gift of
oQMViymb610,3275839,3283359,some form of movement every day  and surrounding yourself with people  whose energy uplifts you this is so
oQMViymb610,3283359,3289119,important  also creating space in your day or at  least just give yourself at least a
oQMViymb610,3289119,3296079,minimum of five minutes of stillness  that alone time is so crucial when you  can distance yourself from the voices of
oQMViymb610,3296079,3301520,the world  so you can hear your own voice loud and  clear that's why
oQMViymb610,3301520,3306720,i have dedicated sundays as my time for  recalibration and renewal
oQMViymb610,3306720,3313520,so sometimes it's just a simple walk in  nature  or  just sitting out in the backyard
oQMViymb610,3313520,3318960,all of it that alone time helps me  re-center refuel me for whatever the
oQMViymb610,3318960,3325520,coming week is and however that shows up  for you that's what you need to do for  you i love how glennon doyle put it in
oQMViymb610,3325520,3332880,her book love warrior she said i have  met myself  and i'm going to care for her fiercely
oQMViymb610,3332880,3339359,so i know we have to be reminded as  women people to continuously make  ourselves a priority because when you
oQMViymb610,3339359,3345280,truly value yourself the world reflects  that worth back to you nobody needs to
oQMViymb610,3345280,3352079,be reminded of the importance of  self-care though more than mothers  so we all know that back in normal times
oQMViymb610,3352079,3358079,before there was a pandemic moms had so  much on their plates  managing the needs of children and
oQMViymb610,3358079,3364400,spouses and households and in-laws and  that's why i have so much respect for  people who do it well
oQMViymb610,3364400,3370319,and now the pandemic has taken its toll  from juggling increased child care
oQMViymb610,3370319,3377200,demands to mental health ramifications  to economic strain from the more than
oQMViymb610,3377200,3383200,you know five million jobs of women were  lost since february of 2020.
oQMViymb610,3383200,3389599,so we know mothers are carrying a heavy  load on their shoulders  and that's just another indication that
oQMViymb610,3389599,3395200,self-focus  on yourself is so important
oQMViymb610,3395200,3400240,is there someone you need to forgive  it's one of the most difficult
oQMViymb610,3400240,3406720,principles of life to practice but it  can also be one of the most rewarding  it's one of the grandest gifts you can
oQMViymb610,3406720,3412640,give to yourself  you forgive  and you become relieved of the heavy
oQMViymb610,3412640,3418319,burden  of resentment that you've been carrying  that's weighing you down you become
oQMViymb610,3418319,3423359,lighter literally and things in your  life begin to fall into place
oQMViymb610,3423359,3429200,so as someone who has experienced abuse  during childhood i know very well
oQMViymb610,3429200,3437119,that the struggle to forgive the people  in your life who have hurt you  is is real and it's painful
oQMViymb610,3437119,3443200,but know this it's not about condoning  whatever it is that person did to  mistreat you
oQMViymb610,3443200,3449359,it is about allowing what they did to  affect how you live your life now
oQMViymb610,3449359,3456480,dr joel jampolsky put it to me this way  years ago on the oprah show was a big  aha aha moment that i've accepted now as
oQMViymb610,3456480,3462079,spiritual law when he said forgiveness  is giving up the hope that the past
oQMViymb610,3462079,3467680,could have been any different i repeat  that forgiveness is giving up the hope
oQMViymb610,3467680,3474160,that what would a quarter could have  should have happened in fact  it did not happen it's accepting the
oQMViymb610,3474160,3480160,reality of what did happen  and moving on  this truth has been fundamental in
oQMViymb610,3480160,3485520,allowing me to live my best life it was  transformative you have to come to the
oQMViymb610,3485520,3492000,realization that what might have been  is not what is  easy to hear i know
oQMViymb610,3492000,3497359,and harder to do  you gotta sit with the hurt  feel it
oQMViymb610,3497359,3504480,it's uncomfortable  but when you can rise up and just really  meet that pain face to face and then let
oQMViymb610,3504480,3510640,it flow through you  only then can you let it go and step out  of the hurt of your history into the
oQMViymb610,3510640,3517760,possibility of the present  i've carried this lesson from iyanla  vanzant with me for some time i remember
oQMViymb610,3517760,3525599,years ago on the show she said you can  accept or reject the way you are treated  by other people but until you heal the
oQMViymb610,3525599,3531040,wounds of your past you will continue to  bleed you can bandage the bleeding with
oQMViymb610,3531040,3536559,food with alcohol with drugs with work  with cigarettes with sex she said but
oQMViymb610,3536559,3542160,eventually  it's gonna ooze through and stain your  life
oQMViymb610,3542160,3549520,you must find the strength to open up  the wounds stick your hands inside pull  out the core of the pain that is holding
oQMViymb610,3549520,3555200,you in your past the memories and make  peace with them so here's the formula
oQMViymb610,3555200,3561520,accept what has happened forgive others  forgive yourself accept the now
oQMViymb610,3561520,3566880,that is the recipe to begin healing and  give up the hope that the past could
oQMViymb610,3566880,3574319,have been anything other than what it  actually was  whatever happened  helped to make you you
oQMViymb610,3574319,3579599,my hope is that you find the courage to  relinquish all your grudges because
oQMViymb610,3579599,3584839,what i do know for sure is that on the  other side of forgiveness  is
oQMViymb610,3584839,3590559,freedom the freedom to live the life for  which you were intended and the one you
oQMViymb610,3590559,3595680,actually deserve  [Music]  there are so many feelings that we've
oQMViymb610,3595680,3601040,all experienced over the past year and a  half  as a collective
oQMViymb610,3601040,3606480,so we're all in it together i know we've  heard that before a lot of people don't  believe it but we're in it together
oQMViymb610,3606480,3612480,feeling the same things whether we agree  on what we're feeling or not and one of  the abiding feelings i know
oQMViymb610,3612480,3618960,is the sense of uncertainty not knowing  for sure what is next so
oQMViymb610,3618960,3626079,our lives have been shaken up and  shifted to say the least which has made  a lot of us uncertain of what is on the
oQMViymb610,3626079,3633440,horizon when will we go back to the  office full time what is that going to  require me how long will we be wearing
oQMViymb610,3633440,3640960,masks how long will we be fighting about  masks when will all of this be over and  it it really is completely natural to
oQMViymb610,3640960,3647280,not have all of the answers so one thing  i do know for sure is that we all have  to let go
oQMViymb610,3647280,3654079,of  knowing  of having complete control  and being able to ready ourselves to
oQMViymb610,3654079,3661280,navigate waves of change as they come  but how do we do that  anxiety comes when we live in the
oQMViymb610,3661280,3666640,unpredictable nuances of the future all  the what-ifs you know i remember when i
oQMViymb610,3666640,3672799,was on trial back in 1998 for  disparaging a burger and had to sit in a  courtroom for six weeks in amarillo
oQMViymb610,3672799,3679920,thank you very much and in the beginning  of that trial i had so much anxiety  learning to stay focused on just that
oQMViymb610,3679920,3687599,day and not the multiple days ahead is  what actually kept me sane  so i think we all must practice becoming
oQMViymb610,3687599,3692799,more comfortable stepping into the  unknown and when those uncertain
oQMViymb610,3692799,3699359,overwhelmed  feelings creep in you need to make an  effort to stay in the present moment and
oQMViymb610,3699359,3705280,just be still  and breathe  and say to yourself i am here now and
oQMViymb610,3705280,3712480,right now everything is okay all is well  i'll be well  and there's nothing i cannot handle so
oQMViymb610,3712480,3717920,take some time to be quiet enough to  listen to your internal gps your truer
oQMViymb610,3717920,3724960,self and let the clamor of the world  dissipate listen to the whispers as i  like to say and then let
oQMViymb610,3724960,3730079,that guide you sometimes just the fear  of uncertainty can stop us from taking
oQMViymb610,3730079,3735440,the next step toward a breakthrough but  we cannot let uncertainty
oQMViymb610,3735440,3740480,just fester and morph then into doubt  doubt that your fortitude that your
oQMViymb610,3740480,3747359,determination that your values won't  have your back as you navigate whatever  is coming next now they've been there
oQMViymb610,3747359,3754240,for you in the past they're there for  you now and they will be by your side as  time goes on so look at where you've
oQMViymb610,3754240,3759520,come from how far you've journeyed to  get to the you that you are now
oQMViymb610,3759520,3765680,and you're still adapting evolving to an  ever better  version of yourself hopefully that's
oQMViymb610,3765680,3770720,what we're all trying to do  who you are  and what you believe in can remain
oQMViymb610,3770720,3776559,steadfast and rooted enough to take on  uncertainty
oQMViymb610,3776559,3782960,there is so  much going on in the world right now  mass mandates are changing all over the
oQMViymb610,3782960,3788880,country as vaccination rates are  going up travel is coming back a return
oQMViymb610,3788880,3796000,to working in the office may be in the  foreseeable future for a lot of you and  as we look to this next chapter after
oQMViymb610,3796000,3801359,such a long and challenging stretch i  think it's time for us all to think
oQMViymb610,3801359,3806400,about refreshing ourselves in a way that  allows us to keep what matters most turn
oQMViymb610,3806400,3812880,over what we're ready to let go of and  make room for the new  in our world
oQMViymb610,3812880,3818720,in our lives so i don't know about you  all but i am forever changed by all of
oQMViymb610,3818720,3825200,these months away from the bustle of the  world and i will forever more carefully
oQMViymb610,3825200,3830319,choose what has to have my attention and  what does not because i've learned a lot
oQMViymb610,3830319,3836640,of things do not so when we hit that  little refresh button on our computers  or phones it updates everything so
oQMViymb610,3836640,3843760,quickly and just like that so simple  sometimes it's even automated so there's  not even anything thinking about it
oQMViymb610,3843760,3851039,a refresh though in real life  as we know takes effort it takes time  takes patience so be kind to yourself
oQMViymb610,3851039,3858400,during these days check in be still  until you can hear and feel the answers  you need for moving forward
oQMViymb610,3858400,3865359,and always feel blessed  that we survived a pandemic
oQMViymb610,3865359,3870400,and we have another chance  to get things right
oQMViymb610,3870400,3878400,in our daily lives  and i would say  that the best way to begin to figure out
oQMViymb610,3878400,3884720,who  you are really meant to be  is to ask the universe
oQMViymb610,3884720,3891440,god that question  god how can i be used in service to
oQMViymb610,3891440,3897440,myself first and how can i then use that  service to serve the world
oQMViymb610,3897440,3903599,use your life to serve the world and you  will find that it also serves you
oQMViymb610,3903599,3909680,one of the biggest mistakes people make  is thinking that they have to get paid a  lot of money or even get paid at all for  their calling
oQMViymb610,3909680,3914960,you are here to honor your calling  whether you're paid for it or not if you
oQMViymb610,3914960,3922000,can get paid for it that makes life  exponentially better  but if you are not paid for it that is
oQMViymb610,3922000,3928480,also really just fine because honoring  the calling feeds everything else you do
oQMViymb610,3928480,3936480,in your life  letting go of energy that's clouding  your vision and holding you back it's a
oQMViymb610,3936480,3943440,life practice that i learned long ago  that has freed me  so many ways it's a fact that holding
oQMViymb610,3943440,3950079,grudges against somebody who's done you  wrong or  replaying revisiting hurtful situations
oQMViymb610,3950079,3955440,in your head over and over only weighs  you down and prevents you from being who
oQMViymb610,3955440,3962079,you're meant to be  right now because you're still  energetically holding on to the past the
oQMViymb610,3962079,3969119,energy that you put into constantly  rewinding to the resentment why did they  do that why did they say that to me i
oQMViymb610,3969119,3975280,didn't deserve to be treated that way  all of that only keeps you stuck
oQMViymb610,3975280,3980480,it will never change what happened you  gotta press stop
oQMViymb610,3980480,3986400,and reject the urge to keep replaying  so that you can then fast forward into
oQMViymb610,3986400,3992160,the now for yourself you know  a lot of people think  that holding on to things that
oQMViymb610,3992160,3997920,disempowered them  is going to somehow magically turn it  around
oQMViymb610,3997920,4004079,as i said in my message a couple weeks  ago about forgiveness  you have to release the notion give up
oQMViymb610,4004079,4011599,the hope that the past could have been  any different and you also must release  the idea that people would do what you
oQMViymb610,4011599,4017359,might do in any given instance this is a  big one i had to learn and relearn
oQMViymb610,4017359,4022799,before i actually got it expecting  people to do what you would do in a
oQMViymb610,4022799,4028880,situation only leads to your  disappointment  not theirs they're going on with their
oQMViymb610,4028880,4036000,life  so let people be who they are and either  you accept it or you don't
oQMViymb610,4036000,4042319,not doing that keeps you stuck in a  circumstance that actually costs you  time costs you energy and i can
oQMViymb610,4042319,4047680,guarantee that oftentimes the person on  the other side of the bitterness you're  holding on to they're not even thinking
oQMViymb610,4047680,4054319,about you  in fact they probably have just moved on  they certainly aren't obsessing the way
oQMViymb610,4054319,4059359,you are think of it like letting go of  any bad habit that just doesn't serve  your well-being
oQMViymb610,4059359,4066960,not an easy task  taking the road to a more enlightened  healthy existence never is so
oQMViymb610,4066960,4072640,this is what i want to ask you to ask  yourself  why  am i holding on to this
oQMViymb610,4072640,4077920,how is this serving me  and really think about the answer
oQMViymb610,4077920,4083280,maybe it makes you feel validated maybe  it makes you feel righteous  or maybe
oQMViymb610,4083280,4090559,taking on the pain is your way of  recognizing the injustice so that even  though it won't be made right
oQMViymb610,4090559,4096640,it can at least not be forgotten  then i ask you  again ask yourself
oQMViymb610,4096640,4102159,do you want to be right  or do you want peace
oQMViymb610,4102159,4109520,this was huge for me the unfortunate  fact is that having both may not be  possible and also you may never get your
oQMViymb610,4109520,4114560,moment of righteousness so why wait for  it choose peace
oQMViymb610,4114560,4119838,what i know for sure  is that in this world time is a moving
oQMViymb610,4119838,4126560,on and it's our most valuable commodity  you can never get it back  so staying in that loop playing it over
oQMViymb610,4126560,4132640,and over in your head of hurt only  amplifies your pain let it go exhale
oQMViymb610,4132640,4139758,make room in your heart for something  that is uplifting  surround yourself with people who want
oQMViymb610,4139758,4144960,the best for you you have the ability to  shift the dna of your spirit and control
oQMViymb610,4144960,4152100,how you perceive life so why not lighten  your load and let it go
oQMViymb610,4152100,4157679,[Music]  knowing when you know better you do  better we're ready to move on to what i
oQMViymb610,4157679,4162798,think is another powerful lesson that i  started to get when i was a really young
oQMViymb610,4162798,4168798,girl having been raised by my  grandmother and then at six years old  being separated from my grandmother
oQMViymb610,4168798,4173920,being moved to milwaukee and suddenly in  a foreign environment for myself i
oQMViymb610,4173920,4180960,remember walking into that new space and  recognizing that  in many ways i was alone which is a
oQMViymb610,4180960,4186400,terrible feeling if you're six years old  but i have always had the deep
oQMViymb610,4186400,4192400,understanding for myself  that if anything was going to move  forward in my life that i was going to
oQMViymb610,4192400,4198560,have to be responsible for making that  happen  and  i know that to be true now and can
oQMViymb610,4198560,4203760,articulate it as you are responsible  for your
oQMViymb610,4203760,4208880,life and if you're sitting around  waiting on somebody to save you to fix
oQMViymb610,4208880,4214719,you to even help you  you are wasting your time because only
oQMViymb610,4214719,4221280,you have the power to take  responsibility to move your life forward
oQMViymb610,4221280,4228880,and the sooner you get that the sooner  your life gets into gear this is what i  know from doing 25 years and thousands
oQMViymb610,4228880,4234560,and thousands of interviews on the oprah  show  it does not matter where you come from
oQMViymb610,4234560,4241679,i have seen people come out of the  desert walk across the desert being born  in the most dire circumstances doesn't
oQMViymb610,4241679,4247520,matter what your mama did whether she  did or had a phd or no d
oQMViymb610,4247520,4254000,what matters is now this moment and your  willingness to see this moment for what
oQMViymb610,4254000,4260239,it is accept it  forgive the past take responsibility
oQMViymb610,4260239,4263719,and move forward
oQMViymb610,4272120,4275489,[Music]
