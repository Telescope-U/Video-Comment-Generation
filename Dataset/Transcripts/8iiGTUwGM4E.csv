8iiGTUwGM4E,1720,3554,"Hello, everyone."
8iiGTUwGM4E,3554,5318,Shibasaki here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,5318,7852,How’ve you been?
8iiGTUwGM4E,7853,10163,"Oh, that’s good."
8iiGTUwGM4E,13257,17000,I’ve turned 75…
8iiGTUwGM4E,17000,20556,…but thanks to your support…
8iiGTUwGM4E,20556,24896,…I’ve been very well as you can see.
8iiGTUwGM4E,25801,27858,However…
8iiGTUwGM4E,27858,32522,…something very astonishing happened to me…
8iiGTUwGM4E,32522,34215,…the other day.
8iiGTUwGM4E,35292,41256,The world-famous computer software company…
8iiGTUwGM4E,41256,44448,…Adobe contacted me.
8iiGTUwGM4E,45662,50809,I actually learned that they are a world-famous company…
8iiGTUwGM4E,50809,52545,…later from my son.
8iiGTUwGM4E,52987,55552,"They said, “Mr. Shibasaki.”"
8iiGTUwGM4E,55552,60248,“There’s this very nice tool.”
8iiGTUwGM4E,60249,65665,“Do you want to try and paint digitally?”
8iiGTUwGM4E,67321,71784,That’s the invitation I got from them.
8iiGTUwGM4E,71785,77678,"I’ve been painting in entire my life, over 50 years."
8iiGTUwGM4E,77678,80873,But because of my age…
8iiGTUwGM4E,80873,87954,…I’ve always thought as if digital were something from a whole different world.
8iiGTUwGM4E,89113,96500,Because of this warm invitation however…
8iiGTUwGM4E,96500,98841,…being 75 years old…
8iiGTUwGM4E,98841,106954,…I’ll take the plunge and try it as if I were going to jump down from the stage of the Kiyomizu Temple.
8iiGTUwGM4E,108251,114825,What I’m going to use for this project is…
8iiGTUwGM4E,114825,116467,…this.
8iiGTUwGM4E,116827,118373,iPad.
8iiGTUwGM4E,120692,124135,And this “Apple Pencil.”
8iiGTUwGM4E,127998,134874,And the tool I got from Adobe is…
8iiGTUwGM4E,134874,136183,…this.
8iiGTUwGM4E,139246,143367,An app called “Adobe Fresco.”
8iiGTUwGM4E,143367,149216,I’ve already had my son install that app…
8iiGTUwGM4E,149216,152711,…onto this iPad.
8iiGTUwGM4E,154505,157159,Now at age 75…
8iiGTUwGM4E,157159,162720,…I’m going to try my very first digital art.
8iiGTUwGM4E,162720,166201,Relax and enjoy until the end of this episode.
8iiGTUwGM4E,166931,169846,Let’s get started then.
8iiGTUwGM4E,169846,172657,I’m not sure if I can do this well.
8iiGTUwGM4E,172657,175979,This is my first attempt after all.
8iiGTUwGM4E,177414,180911,I’m going to use this tablet.
8iiGTUwGM4E,181794,186354,I need to use this pencil here…
8iiGTUwGM4E,186354,190136,…and I think I was told to swipe this screen this direction.
8iiGTUwGM4E,191330,192524,Here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,192524,194267,I see “Fresco” here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,194267,195706,This must be it.
8iiGTUwGM4E,195706,198700,Here are some choices of “paper.”
8iiGTUwGM4E,198700,202244,Let’s try this A4 as I always do.
8iiGTUwGM4E,203679,206633,Here’s the frame.
8iiGTUwGM4E,206633,209698,What’s this now?
8iiGTUwGM4E,209699,212295,“Pixel Brushes”?
8iiGTUwGM4E,212295,214521,Brushes I assume.
8iiGTUwGM4E,214521,217252,So many different types!
8iiGTUwGM4E,218604,221927,There’s this “Sketch”.
8iiGTUwGM4E,221927,224417,Let’s use this “Pencil” today.
8iiGTUwGM4E,224997,228715,So I’m using this “Pencil” for drawing.
8iiGTUwGM4E,228716,231948,Now what is this?
8iiGTUwGM4E,231948,233621,Oh.
8iiGTUwGM4E,233621,236125,This is a color wheel.
8iiGTUwGM4E,236125,241383,I don’t need this because I only need a black pencil today.
8iiGTUwGM4E,241383,243793,What’s next?
8iiGTUwGM4E,243793,245647,“Size”?
8iiGTUwGM4E,248296,249843,Ah.
8iiGTUwGM4E,249843,252645,The dot becomes bigger and smaller.
8iiGTUwGM4E,254466,255916,“Size”?
8iiGTUwGM4E,255916,258028,And this?
8iiGTUwGM4E,258359,260643,It says “Flow”.
8iiGTUwGM4E,261002,265115,The dot becomes lighter and darker.
8iiGTUwGM4E,265115,266982,I see!
8iiGTUwGM4E,267865,269603,I got it!
8iiGTUwGM4E,269603,271625,What about this “Smoothing”?
8iiGTUwGM4E,271625,274142,I’m not sure about this.
8iiGTUwGM4E,277481,280659,“Try this brush.”
8iiGTUwGM4E,283005,286416,I see I can try out this pencil here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,286416,289107,Then I’ll try it.
8iiGTUwGM4E,291342,295984,I’m making this pencil smaller in size.
8iiGTUwGM4E,295984,299612,Surely the pencil trace is thinner than before.
8iiGTUwGM4E,301875,305747,What about if I make this lighter?
8iiGTUwGM4E,305747,307678,"Yes, it IS lighter!"
8iiGTUwGM4E,310603,313528,It’s amazing!
8iiGTUwGM4E,313528,315961,With these settings…
8iiGTUwGM4E,315961,319817,…I can change how the pencil line looks here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,319817,323443,I’ll try and draw a house then.
8iiGTUwGM4E,323443,326466,Just a simple house.
8iiGTUwGM4E,326467,328721,Is this good?
8iiGTUwGM4E,330000,332346,I think it’s too big.
8iiGTUwGM4E,332346,334714,I want to make it smaller.
8iiGTUwGM4E,334714,336168,Too big.
8iiGTUwGM4E,336168,338367,What should I do?
8iiGTUwGM4E,338367,340711,What to do!?
8iiGTUwGM4E,340711,342386,Well?
8iiGTUwGM4E,342386,344659,Here’s this “Undo”.
8iiGTUwGM4E,344659,347586,I assume I can undo what I’ve done.
8iiGTUwGM4E,347586,350120,This is great!
8iiGTUwGM4E,350120,351656,See?
8iiGTUwGM4E,351656,354624,I can start over!
8iiGTUwGM4E,354624,356826,This is excellent.
8iiGTUwGM4E,356826,358332,Undo.
8iiGTUwGM4E,358333,359741,Oops.
8iiGTUwGM4E,360293,362431,"Undo, undo."
8iiGTUwGM4E,363397,367668,It’s great that I can undo what I don’t like.
8iiGTUwGM4E,367668,373684,Then I won’t have to be afraid of making mistakes.
8iiGTUwGM4E,374981,378742,This is how this app works.
8iiGTUwGM4E,378743,382311,Let’s add a road.
8iiGTUwGM4E,383884,387064,I’m excited to keep working.
8iiGTUwGM4E,387064,389859,Here’s a tree.
8iiGTUwGM4E,391542,393399,Well?
8iiGTUwGM4E,396000,400444,I can draw as if I were using a regular pencil.
8iiGTUwGM4E,400444,403475,Adding a chimney.
8iiGTUwGM4E,405131,408497,Now I want to fix this.
8iiGTUwGM4E,409297,411279,Where’s an eraser?
8iiGTUwGM4E,411279,412279,Eraser?
8iiGTUwGM4E,412279,415035,I can erase it completely.
8iiGTUwGM4E,415035,419110,This is not necessary and should be erased too.
8iiGTUwGM4E,420297,424762,This eraser won’t damage the paper.
8iiGTUwGM4E,424866,426540,Amazing!
8iiGTUwGM4E,426933,433629,I’m not afraid of mistakes because of the eraser and the “Undo” button.
8iiGTUwGM4E,435340,438797,They make me feel good.
8iiGTUwGM4E,438797,444871,Let’s make the pencil thicker and a little lighter.
8iiGTUwGM4E,445755,448861,I want to use it for the sky.
8iiGTUwGM4E,448861,450600,Right here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,451898,453670,Nice!
8iiGTUwGM4E,454250,457925,This is exactly what I can do with a pencil.
8iiGTUwGM4E,459194,462355,This shading feels great.
8iiGTUwGM4E,465170,472861,What’s great about this is that it sensitively reacts to the pressure I add to the pencil just like a regular pencil.
8iiGTUwGM4E,472861,477374,So I can draw something just like I do on paper.
8iiGTUwGM4E,478505,485421,A pencil on paper… this is exactly what you can do with this app.
8iiGTUwGM4E,485421,487421,It’s so smooth.
8iiGTUwGM4E,489971,497476,"Also, another shade is added over the first one where I run this pencil twice."
8iiGTUwGM4E,500732,507320,Now let’s make this pencil darker to shade this side now.
8iiGTUwGM4E,512536,518997,It really does look like I’m drawing on the paper if I enlarge the screen.
8iiGTUwGM4E,518997,521500,Fantastic!
8iiGTUwGM4E,523542,525786,This is a lot of fun!
8iiGTUwGM4E,527055,530320,Take advantage of different touches.
8iiGTUwGM4E,530320,532941,I know what I’m doing now.
8iiGTUwGM4E,532941,536527,It’s so easy to get used to this tool.
8iiGTUwGM4E,536527,540532,You can start using this tool for a pencil drawing…
8iiGTUwGM4E,540532,543324,…if you’re used to using a pencil.
8iiGTUwGM4E,543324,547355,"I’m using this for the first time, but that’s what I feel."
8iiGTUwGM4E,547355,549509,Now…
8iiGTUwGM4E,549509,554756,…let’s make the pencil thicker and shade this spot…
8iiGTUwGM4E,554756,557711,…right here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,557711,559857,Darker and thicker.
8iiGTUwGM4E,560933,563748,Right below the roof.
8iiGTUwGM4E,565735,569768,Let’s enlarge the screen for this process.
8iiGTUwGM4E,571175,577649,It’s perfect for people like me who are far-sighted.
8iiGTUwGM4E,581402,585876,The app has everything you need.
8iiGTUwGM4E,585876,588626,"You’re amazing, Fresco!"
8iiGTUwGM4E,590283,593790,I can truly enjoy drawing.
8iiGTUwGM4E,595860,598470,Very good!
8iiGTUwGM4E,598470,602990,Why don’t I use the eraser for these lines that ran off the frame.
8iiGTUwGM4E,605254,607698,How much?
8iiGTUwGM4E,607698,609814,This much maybe?
8iiGTUwGM4E,611553,613912,And erase here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,613912,617597,I guess I could use feature this for something else.
8iiGTUwGM4E,617597,621334,Why don’t I draw roof tiles with this?
8iiGTUwGM4E,623460,631917,"Because this eraser is so sensitive, I think it’s a good idea to use it to draw the shape of something."
8iiGTUwGM4E,634125,636178,Here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,636178,637802,Now.
8iiGTUwGM4E,637802,640372,I got it so far.
8iiGTUwGM4E,640372,643696,Work on the other house too.
8iiGTUwGM4E,648222,651238,Now I want to work on this tree.
8iiGTUwGM4E,651238,654457,Make the pencil darker.
8iiGTUwGM4E,657301,660416,Is this good enough?
8iiGTUwGM4E,663893,671026,So I guess this tool has pencils of various levels of darkness…
8iiGTUwGM4E,671026,675417,…and lead of various levels of thickness.
8iiGTUwGM4E,675417,679745,And I can use all of them in this one pen.
8iiGTUwGM4E,685899,689290,Let’s make it thinner now…
8iiGTUwGM4E,689290,692367,…to draw leaves.
8iiGTUwGM4E,692367,695689,Use the stippling technique like this…
8iiGTUwGM4E,695689,697258,…by dotting.
8iiGTUwGM4E,697258,699584,It’s fun!
8iiGTUwGM4E,700329,702954,This is amazing.
8iiGTUwGM4E,702954,704134,Look.
8iiGTUwGM4E,704134,707212,I’m adding details to the roof.
8iiGTUwGM4E,707212,710175,Now the roof tiles.
8iiGTUwGM4E,711390,715446,It reacts right to the pencil pressure.
8iiGTUwGM4E,715446,721849,You can clearly see I pressed the pencil hard and brushed it.
8iiGTUwGM4E,722980,725673,I’m so impressed!
8iiGTUwGM4E,725673,727664,"Oh, this is the wheel."
8iiGTUwGM4E,727664,730241,That’s not what I wanted.
8iiGTUwGM4E,731786,737455,Make the pencil thicker like this…
8iiGTUwGM4E,737455,739840,…and lighter.
8iiGTUwGM4E,740999,744299,Make the sky look better with it.
8iiGTUwGM4E,744299,748614,With a different brush stroke.
8iiGTUwGM4E,748614,750784,Is this good?
8iiGTUwGM4E,751446,754084,This is really amazing.
8iiGTUwGM4E,756293,758895,Let’s add a window.
8iiGTUwGM4E,758895,761096,Around here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,761096,765512,I’m using sharper lines for it.
8iiGTUwGM4E,770425,776269,If you use sharper lines over and over like this…
8iiGTUwGM4E,776270,780443,…it looks like as if you had drawn by hand.
8iiGTUwGM4E,780443,782456,Interesting.
8iiGTUwGM4E,782456,784934,It’s another excellent feature.
8iiGTUwGM4E,786479,792379,"Not just smoothly, but you can also use these rough touches."
8iiGTUwGM4E,792379,796375,Then the drawing produces this analog appearance.
8iiGTUwGM4E,797341,802593,This tool is so useful for various representations.
8iiGTUwGM4E,803228,808521,I’ve learned a lot already in such a short time since I started using this.
8iiGTUwGM4E,808521,812285,With the eraser made thin…
8iiGTUwGM4E,812285,817240,…I can draw the window frame…
8iiGTUwGM4E,817240,819069,…and a roof.
8iiGTUwGM4E,823126,827329,You can’t do this with a real eraser.
8iiGTUwGM4E,827329,829759,This is fantastic!
8iiGTUwGM4E,832602,836196,This is so handy if you know what to do.
8iiGTUwGM4E,836196,837899,Well?
8iiGTUwGM4E,841598,848487,It perfectly reproduces such thin lines and subtle levels of pressure.
8iiGTUwGM4E,850143,854235,Now adding the shadow of the building.
8iiGTUwGM4E,854235,856636,Very nice.
8iiGTUwGM4E,856636,859282,I can hardly believe this is my first attempt.
8iiGTUwGM4E,859282,861031,Such fun.
8iiGTUwGM4E,861031,863852,Let’s add a fence…
8iiGTUwGM4E,863852,866084,…like this.
8iiGTUwGM4E,867188,871566,Then a sense of perspective for the road.
8iiGTUwGM4E,871566,873221,So smooth.
8iiGTUwGM4E,874352,877800,Now right here…
8iiGTUwGM4E,877800,881141,…I want to use an eraser…
8iiGTUwGM4E,881141,884563,…to draw something.
8iiGTUwGM4E,884564,887680,Because these erasers are so useful…
8iiGTUwGM4E,887680,890505,…why not take advantage of them?
8iiGTUwGM4E,890505,892762,What about this one?
8iiGTUwGM4E,894631,898625,It erases pencil lines so nicely!
8iiGTUwGM4E,898625,901834,Do you know what I’m making here?
8iiGTUwGM4E,901834,903961,It’s a birch tree.
8iiGTUwGM4E,903961,907065,That’s what I’m planning on anyway.
8iiGTUwGM4E,907065,911918,I’m changing the brush settings…
8iiGTUwGM4E,911918,915900,…so that I can add shades to the tree.
8iiGTUwGM4E,915900,919080,This is amazing!
8iiGTUwGM4E,919080,924693,It responds more quickly and accurately than a regular pencil.
8iiGTUwGM4E,926018,927584,Look!
8iiGTUwGM4E,927584,929751,It’s excellent!
8iiGTUwGM4E,930386,936662,I can make these differences only by changing pressure levels on the pencil.
8iiGTUwGM4E,937932,940379,I’m so hooked!
8iiGTUwGM4E,940821,943761,Fresco’s marvelous!
8iiGTUwGM4E,943762,946001,Seriously.
8iiGTUwGM4E,946001,951001,I’d love to thank the people who developed this tool.
8iiGTUwGM4E,952161,955579,"Look, I’ve added birch leaves."
8iiGTUwGM4E,955579,957652,That’s it.
8iiGTUwGM4E,958509,962115,I also want to add something else.
8iiGTUwGM4E,962116,964277,One of the erasers…
8iiGTUwGM4E,964277,967048,So many different types!
8iiGTUwGM4E,967048,971165,"Sponge, Gritty, Hard, Brush, and even Rubber."
8iiGTUwGM4E,976381,980401,I want to use one to have fun.
8iiGTUwGM4E,982471,985015,What about this: Gritty?
8iiGTUwGM4E,985015,987350,It’s supposed to be gritty.
8iiGTUwGM4E,987350,989428,What’s happening?
8iiGTUwGM4E,989428,991279,Oh?
8iiGTUwGM4E,992218,995595,I guess I should tap with it…
8iiGTUwGM4E,995595,997850,…then I can do it.
8iiGTUwGM4E,998430,1000593,It’s fun!
8iiGTUwGM4E,1001393,1003091,This is nice.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1003091,1006664,I guess I can use it to represent snowfall.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1006664,1011481,You can totally create something you don’t really plan to.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1011481,1015395,"This random, coincidental creation is something you could do with watercolor paint."
8iiGTUwGM4E,1015395,1017735,So fortuitous.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1020193,1024029,Now I’m drawing branches.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1024029,1026673,I like using these quick strokes…
8iiGTUwGM4E,1026673,1031345,…because the tool sensitively reacts natural pressure.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1031345,1034589,I think I’ll draw a person here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1035003,1036597,This big.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1036597,1039746,Let’s enlarge the screen to see.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1045348,1048009,The image of a father…
8iiGTUwGM4E,1048009,1049974,…right here.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1051381,1058214,Just the image I have…
8iiGTUwGM4E,1058214,1060214,…like this?
8iiGTUwGM4E,1061125,1064911,The pencil reproduces my image perfectly.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1066000,1068524,This is a great app.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1069738,1071848,That’s it.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1074497,1076990,I’ve finished my digital drawing.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1076990,1078568,Look.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1081079,1085038,"It’s a little embarrassing to say it myself, but…"
8iiGTUwGM4E,1085038,1087714,…doesn’t it look great?
8iiGTUwGM4E,1089522,1096461,This app is so easy to understand even for a first-time user like myself.

8iiGTUwGM4E,1099769,1101093,Well…
8iiGTUwGM4E,1101093,1104515,…it’s not just user-friendly.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1104515,1106689,Look again.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1110111,1118086,I used this tool for pencil drawing…
8iiGTUwGM4E,1118087,1120857,…with this pencil.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1120857,1126039,But how the pencil works or the reproducibility was just amazing.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1126039,1133217,"Also the shortcomings of using a pencil, like getting the paper dirty…"
8iiGTUwGM4E,1133218,1138318,…have beautifully been resolved.
8iiGTUwGM4E,1138318,1144819,You can immerse yourself in the pencil drawing activities…
