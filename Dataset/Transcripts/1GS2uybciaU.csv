1GS2uybciaU,54399,60239,sessions planned throughout june and as  we wait for the committee to begin  making their case we cannot forget why
1GS2uybciaU,60239,66320,we are here these are just some of the  images from the january 6 committee that  they want the country to never forget
1GS2uybciaU,66320,72640,rioters violently storming the nation's  capital attempting to interrupt the  certification of a democratic election
1GS2uybciaU,72640,79360,some of them even making it onto the  senate floor breaching the very building  where tonight's hearing will take place
1GS2uybciaU,79360,84560,the department of justice has already  arrested more than 800 people in  connection with the january 6 riots many
1GS2uybciaU,84560,90240,of them seen in those images but the  committee tonight is aiming to paint an  even more comprehensive picture and to
1GS2uybciaU,90240,96000,ensure everyone involved from the top to  bottom is held accountable nbc news  senior capitol hill correspondent joins
1GS2uybciaU,96000,101200,us now garrett haike has covered the  events of january 6 since the beginning  and he's in the hallway right outside
1GS2uybciaU,101200,107920,where the prime time hearing will be  broadcast to us live garrett explain to  our viewers what they're going to be  watching from the room behind you in
1GS2uybciaU,107920,114640,just about half an hour is this going to  look like a trial or more like a  powerpoint presentation
1GS2uybciaU,114640,119840,well tom it's not going to look anything  like a typical congressional hearing the  room behind me has been made over that's
1GS2uybciaU,119840,126320,not even normally a hearing room in fact  it's one of the largest rooms available  in the capitol you saw that enormous
1GS2uybciaU,126320,132239,screen that they are using to broadcast  the videos that will be a central  portion of what we see tonight both the
1GS2uybciaU,132239,138480,new video you talked about from the  documentary filmmaker as well as videos  of interviews conducted by the committee
1GS2uybciaU,138480,144480,that portion may in fact look like a  trial you will see deposition videos of  people like ivanka trump and jared
1GS2uybciaU,144480,150959,kushner who the american people will be  hearing from about this attack really  for the very first time and unlike in a
1GS2uybciaU,150959,156560,traditional hearing you won't have those  five-minute back and forth you won't  have a counter narrative being presented
1GS2uybciaU,156560,162560,by another party here this is a  production by the january 6 committee  over this two hour time frame to tell a
1GS2uybciaU,162560,168000,very specific story there'll be six more  chapters but tonight is the opening  argument if we want to stick with the
1GS2uybciaU,168000,173680,trial metaphor speaking of telling a  story i do want to ask you about the  presentation the video itself the
1GS2uybciaU,173680,179360,committee tapped a former top broadcast  executive james goldston a former  president of abc news and in full
1GS2uybciaU,179360,185280,disclosure my former boss to advise in  the production of tonight's prime time  hearing he's somebody who's worked on
1GS2uybciaU,185280,191840,documentaries including uh my life with  michael jackson which was an incredible  documentary he's produced election
1GS2uybciaU,191840,198400,specials debate specials he knows what  he's doing why do you think the  democrats needed to bring in a heavy  hitter when it comes to the production
1GS2uybciaU,198400,204640,of this prime time hearing to the  american public  tom the committee wants to grab people
1GS2uybciaU,204640,210959,who aren't tuning in looking for news  they want the viewers who may be turned  on the tv tonight looking for csi or the
1GS2uybciaU,210959,216560,masked singer okay they need the people  who have not been following this  investigation every step of the way to
1GS2uybciaU,216560,222640,see the story they are trying to tell  and to stay in their seats and watch it  and for that the committee wanted
1GS2uybciaU,222640,228640,professional assistance here to make  sure they weren't just giving people  another washington story about what
1GS2uybciaU,228640,234000,happened on january 6th but they were  providing a compelling message about  what they say was a threat that started
1GS2uybciaU,234000,240879,the moment donald trump lost the  election and continues not just to the  sixth but they will argue all the way up
1GS2uybciaU,240879,247200,until this very moment and into future  elections for that they needed to tell a  story not just hold a traditional
1GS2uybciaU,247200,254640,hearing all right garrett hey stand by  for us we will be coming back to you we  thank you for your reporting tonight's  hearing held nearly 520 days after
1GS2uybciaU,254640,261120,january 6 but the committee is hoping to  make sure the country never forgets that  day and that the people responsible are
1GS2uybciaU,261120,267360,held accountable so how do we get here  nbc news anchor hallie jackson has a  look back
1GS2uybciaU,267360,274160,it's a day that nearly brought america  to its knees  an attack on the capitol after former
1GS2uybciaU,274160,282840,president trump's lies that the 2020  election was stolen it was not we're  going to walk down to the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,283520,290160,and we're going to cheer on  our brave senators and  congressmen and women
1GS2uybciaU,290160,296479,and we're probably not going to be  cheering so much for  some of them angry rioters clashing with
1GS2uybciaU,296479,302639,police  breaching the capitol steps going inside  the building to try to stop the counting
1GS2uybciaU,302639,308400,of electoral votes that would officially  make joe biden the president  five people died two of whom were
1GS2uybciaU,308400,314320,officers who died by suicide after the  insurrection and about 140 people were  hurt with one and a half million dollars
1GS2uybciaU,314320,321520,worth of damages to the capitol building  itself across the country shock and at  first fury and at the capitol a new
1GS2uybciaU,321520,327600,committee created intending to  investigate and report on what led up to  what they called the domestic terrorist
1GS2uybciaU,327600,334639,attack on the capitol the committee's  creation controversial with many  republicans decrying it as overly
1GS2uybciaU,334639,339919,partisan and democrats insisting it is a  fact-finding mission ultimately seven
1GS2uybciaU,339919,346080,democrats and two republicans began  their work in late july of 2021 with  public testimony from four police
1GS2uybciaU,346080,351360,officers who defended the capitol on  january 6. we simply want justice and
1GS2uybciaU,351360,357600,accountability  for most people generally six happened  for a few hours
1GS2uybciaU,357600,364240,before  but for all  for those of us who work were in the  thick of it
1GS2uybciaU,364240,371120,it has not ended since then the  committee has conducted more than a  thousand depositions and interviews  behind closed doors received more than
1GS2uybciaU,371120,377600,140 000 documents and issued 98 public  subpoenas  some complied with the subpoenas like
1GS2uybciaU,377600,384800,some members of the trump family and  former white house aide former white  house chief of staff mark meadows did  not testify at deposition scheduled by
1GS2uybciaU,384800,390319,the house committee investigating that  capital riot others refused to testify  like former white house chief of staff
1GS2uybciaU,390319,397039,mark meadows and former white house  aides steve bannon peter navarro and dan  scavino all four have since been held in
1GS2uybciaU,397039,403840,contempt of congress for refusing to  testify former trump aide steve bannon  indicted for contempt of congress bannon
1GS2uybciaU,403840,409280,and navarro were also indicted by a  federal grand jury for contempt of  congress both refusing to provide the
1GS2uybciaU,409280,414880,committee with documents or testimony  the committee more recently escalating  its investigation by subpoenaing members
1GS2uybciaU,414880,420639,of congress they just issued subpoenas  to five sitting members of congress
1GS2uybciaU,420639,428560,including the house republican leader  kevin mccarthy but all five of those  members have declined to testify so far
1GS2uybciaU,430000,436720,they just want to go after their  political opponents so what are the  committee's big revelations to this  point first text messages showed members
1GS2uybciaU,436720,442479,of congress journalists and even members  of the president's own family begging  mark meadows to tell former president
1GS2uybciaU,442479,448720,trump to stop the insurrection messages  initially obtained by cnn  second the committee found a more than
1GS2uybciaU,448720,454240,seven hour gap in white house phone logs  during the riot when they know former  president trump had been in touch with
1GS2uybciaU,454240,460400,republican lawmakers like leader  mccarthy and alabama senator tommy  tuberville
1GS2uybciaU,460400,465919,hallie jackson joins us now live from  washington d.c and hadley i know you  watched the january 6 events unfold what
1GS2uybciaU,465919,471919,were your thoughts then and what has  surprised you most as we get underway  tonight yeah tom part of our coverage
1GS2uybciaU,471919,478080,actually here on nbc news for a special  report that was supposed to last you  know a short amount of time through the  certification of these election results
1GS2uybciaU,478080,483520,and then and then stretched on for hours  there at the time i was covering the  trump white house and so for me the
1GS2uybciaU,483520,491039,biggest reporting suit pursuit was  trying to find out in these minutes in  these hours what was donald trump doing
1GS2uybciaU,491039,497840,that was a huge part of our um of the  questions that i was asking sources that  day the the areas that i was you know
1GS2uybciaU,497840,504000,really really focused on what i think is  surprising or at least interesting about  now tom is that is still the same
1GS2uybciaU,504000,509520,question that these committee  investigators have what was donald trump  doing as they seek to link him to this
1GS2uybciaU,509520,515360,broader conspiracy as you and garrett  hake laid out potentially connecting the  dots between the insurrection and then
1GS2uybciaU,515360,521279,the actions of the former president at  the time  that is  why you will see a lot of this laid out
1GS2uybciaU,521279,527040,and i think that's going to be the focus  of these hearings as we move forward  tonight is a big night it is the start  but it is just the start you know
1GS2uybciaU,527040,533200,there's more hearings to come tom hallie  i know you had the chance to speak with  the widow of a dc police officer jeffrey
1GS2uybciaU,533200,539200,smith he is one of four police officers  who took his life after the capitol  riots officers who responded to that on
1GS2uybciaU,539200,545519,january 6. what did she tell you that  she hopes happens in the days ahead  i'm glad you asked about this tom thank
1GS2uybciaU,545519,550880,you because officer jeff smith was she  described him a jokester you know  lighthearted guy was an amazing guy
1GS2uybciaU,550880,557279,loved his dog loved being a son and a  husband he died by suicide nine days  after the insurrection and it was only
1GS2uybciaU,557279,564000,in march tom that that death was  formally declared a line of duty death  because of the trauma he suffered on the
1GS2uybciaU,564000,569360,day of the insurrection  what she told me to your question about  what she wanted to see moving forward
1GS2uybciaU,569360,574959,she hopes that americans people watching  understand that people like her husband
1GS2uybciaU,574959,581600,gave their lives in service of  protecting democracy on that day and  what's also interesting you know what  her attorney told me
1GS2uybciaU,581600,589040,there are discussions she's going to be  in this hearing room tonight okay she's  going she's going to be there in the  room with two other partners spouses of
1GS2uybciaU,589040,595440,officers who lost their lives in the  aftermath of january 6. and then she has  a meeting with one of the staff  directors one of the members of the sort
1GS2uybciaU,595440,602079,of aides that work on this committee  about possibly being a witness herself  tom so it's possible that she will have
1GS2uybciaU,602079,608959,an even more public platform to talk  about the person you're seeing on screen  her beloved husband  jeff as she as she calls him of course
1GS2uybciaU,608959,615440,and what his life meant  and how violent in her view that day was  what he witnessed what she knows he
1GS2uybciaU,615440,621360,witnessed based on his body cam video  that has now come out etc um and so for  her it is it's accountability on a small
1GS2uybciaU,621360,627440,scale but but more broadly it's about  making sure that people understand the  legacy that officer smith and others
1GS2uybciaU,627440,633279,leave behind hallie jackson for us halle  i know you'll be standing by for us as  well we thank you for your reporting so
1GS2uybciaU,633279,638959,as we have mentioned this is the  congressional investigation this is not  the criminal investigation but there is
1GS2uybciaU,638959,644959,a criminal investigation that has been  ongoing since january 6. i want to bring  in pete williams right now who joins us
1GS2uybciaU,644959,650000,he's uh our chief correspondent that  covers the justice department for us  pete if you can give our viewers an
1GS2uybciaU,650000,655200,update where does the criminal  investigation stand and i know i asked  you this after hundreds and hundreds of
1GS2uybciaU,655200,660560,arrests have already been made  yeah and that number keeps going up this  is the largest criminal investigation in
1GS2uybciaU,660560,666480,the justice department's history  more than 800 people have now been  charged and this investigation is
1GS2uybciaU,666480,672720,nowhere near done because the goal of  the justice department is certainly to  try to charge anybody who attacked a
1GS2uybciaU,672720,679360,police officer or did any damage to the  capitol but also they've charged people  who were merely in the capitol or on the
1GS2uybciaU,679360,684800,capitol grounds 300 of those people have  already pleaded guilty six of them were
1GS2uybciaU,684800,691360,convicted at trial one person has been  acquitted but the investigation is  nowhere near over now that's the
1GS2uybciaU,691360,698399,investigation of what happened on  january 6th but there is a separate  investigation or you could say an
1GS2uybciaU,698399,705360,offshoot of that investigation of  whether any criminal laws were violated  before january 6. we know the justice
1GS2uybciaU,705360,711040,department is looking at the actions of  republicans in seven states that sent
1GS2uybciaU,711040,718160,alternate slates of electors in to the  national archives saying you know count  us we're the tr where the trump votes or
1GS2uybciaU,718160,723920,in the case of two of those states count  us if the courts throw out the other  votes those are states which in which
1GS2uybciaU,723920,729279,joe biden won the popular vote so  there's a question about whether they  had any legal right to do that or
1GS2uybciaU,729279,735839,whether that amounted to fraud and we  know that there is a broadening federal  investigation looking at what role
1GS2uybciaU,735839,742880,people around the president had in  trying to explore these alternate routes  to try to undermine the electoral vote
1GS2uybciaU,742880,748240,you know pete as we take another live  look at the hearing room where these  this committee will present their
1GS2uybciaU,748240,754240,evidence  it's sort of incredible because on that  day  the capital turned into a crime scene
1GS2uybciaU,754240,761839,right  and i i wonder because the republicans  are attacking this hearing tonight will  the fbi learn anything from this will
1GS2uybciaU,761839,768639,will congress uncover anything the fbi  doesn't already know  oh undoubtedly because the committee has
1GS2uybciaU,768639,773920,talked to some people that the justice  department has not and of course vice  versa
1GS2uybciaU,773920,780079,and nobody that we know of has been  immunized for their testimony before the  house committee that we know of that
1GS2uybciaU,780079,785600,would prevent that testimony from being  used in a congress in a federal  investigation that's always the thing
1GS2uybciaU,785600,792079,you worry about when there are parallel  investigations like this but i think a  lot of what the justice department has
1GS2uybciaU,792079,797360,done they don't really need the  congressional committee and of course  the congressional committee's role here
1GS2uybciaU,797360,803440,is not to build evidence for a criminal  conviction although that may be a goal  of some members of the committee you
1GS2uybciaU,803440,809120,know i have to ask you i know just a few  hours ago a republican candidate for  governor in michigan faced a judge for
1GS2uybciaU,809120,814880,the first time after being arrested for  his alleged involvement in the capital  riots i mean
1GS2uybciaU,814880,820079,even years later they're still  uncovering facts and still finding  suspects
1GS2uybciaU,820079,826560,oh every day we see new charges filed  that the justice department or the fbi  has been investigating for a long time
1GS2uybciaU,826560,832320,they first got a tip about the man  you're talking about ryan kelly who's a  republican candidate for governor in
1GS2uybciaU,832320,837440,michigan in the primary they got a tip  about him 10 days after the election but
1GS2uybciaU,837440,844000,it's taken all this time to build a case  against him based on photographs  surveillance video and and interviews
1GS2uybciaU,844000,849920,with informants and other people who  knew him who said yep that's him at  outside the capitol he says i never went
1GS2uybciaU,849920,856480,into the capital i never harmed any  policemen i never pushed over any police  barricades but nonetheless he faces four
1GS2uybciaU,856480,862959,misdemeanor counts for in essence  glorified trespassing being on the west  front of the capitol that was closed off
1GS2uybciaU,862959,869279,all right pete williams for us tonight  who i know will be watching all this  evidence closely and watching what they  are going to be showing viewers american
1GS2uybciaU,869279,874880,viewers for the first time pete we thank  you for that we are about 20 minutes now  less than 20 minutes from the house
1GS2uybciaU,874880,880959,opening uh their committee and and  hearing the opening remarks and seeing  this video that they have touted so much
1GS2uybciaU,880959,887839,a lot of this basically the entire  portion of this is about the transfer of  power and people that that tried to stop
1GS2uybciaU,887839,894079,it right and and the question i have is  will the president president biden be  watching this tonight i want to bring in
1GS2uybciaU,894079,900800,chief white house correspondent kristen  welker she's in washington for us so so  kristen what do we know we know  president biden is in california for the
1GS2uybciaU,900800,906880,summit of the americas and he made some  comments earlier today  he sure did tom look i've been talking  to white house officials who tell me
1GS2uybciaU,906880,912639,that president biden is expected to  watch at least part of this first  january 6 committee hearing tonight
1GS2uybciaU,912639,918560,while he's in california he's there  hosting an international summit of the  americas now it's worth noting there's a
1GS2uybciaU,918560,924800,large gap in the president's schedule  before he hosts a dinner tonight so it  would not be a surprise if he used that
1GS2uybciaU,924800,931839,time to tune in the summit mr biden is  attending is focused on issues like  covid and migration but the hearing is
1GS2uybciaU,931839,938160,clearly top of mind as well as you  pointed out tom the president talked  about it unprompted while he was holding
1GS2uybciaU,938160,944000,a bilateral meeting with the prime  minister of canada take a listen to what  he had to say
1GS2uybciaU,944000,952639,again one of the things can occupy  my country tonight  i suspect is the first open hearings on
1GS2uybciaU,952639,958160,january the 6th  and  as i said when it was occurring and
1GS2uybciaU,958160,964720,subsequent  i think it was a clear  flagrant violation of the constitution
1GS2uybciaU,964720,970399,i think these guys and women broke the  law tried to turn around the
1GS2uybciaU,970399,976639,result of an election  and  there's a lot of questions who's  responsible who's involved
1GS2uybciaU,976639,981680,i'm not going to make a judgment on that  but i just want to know that much of  this we're going to probably be
1GS2uybciaU,981680,988480,a lot of americans are going to be  seeing for the first time some of the  detail  that that occurred
1GS2uybciaU,988480,994160,now tom the white house wants to be  careful about not being seen as  politicizing the hearing especially
1GS2uybciaU,994160,1000800,given the ongoing investigation by the  justice department that you were just  talking about with pete and don't expect  a rapid response from the white house
1GS2uybciaU,1000800,1006240,throughout the night officials have said  since the president took office they  want to be selective about moments he
1GS2uybciaU,1006240,1011920,weighs in on january 6. still that  doesn't mean we won't get some type of  response from top democrats and
1GS2uybciaU,1011920,1018720,republicans who are clearly watching  tonight's proceedings very closely tom  all right kristen welker for us tonight  kristen we do appreciate that as we take
1GS2uybciaU,1018720,1024240,a live look inside of that hearing room  right now looks like possibly some  witnesses are starting to enter the room
1GS2uybciaU,1024240,1030959,slowly trickling again we're about 15  minutes away from this hearing getting  underway uh there are two main parties
1GS2uybciaU,1030959,1037038,in the united states the democrats and  we've heard christian reporting on what  the white house is doing and the  republicans and and we know that many
1GS2uybciaU,1037038,1042798,people who are on if not  every single rider there on the  president's side um
1GS2uybciaU,1042798,1048400,von hilliard has been covering the  republicans for us and the primaries and  and is covering some trump rallies since
1GS2uybciaU,1048400,1053520,january 6th for us and vaughn i guess my  first question to you is what are you  hearing out there on the trail and and
1GS2uybciaU,1053520,1059520,and what is team trump saying on a day  like today you know this is if we if i  could go back to january 6 i was
1GS2uybciaU,1059520,1064960,actually at the capitol outside of it  that day there and i think what we all  took away in those days after were the
1GS2uybciaU,1064960,1070720,number of republicans that were  separating themselves from donald trump  even kevin mccarthy and the new
1GS2uybciaU,1070720,1077760,audiotapes that have been released  saying that we got to get to the bottom  of this that is not the message of the  republican party here today and that is
1GS2uybciaU,1077760,1083679,why you are seeing a unified  message here not only from donald  trump's orbit but also the republican
1GS2uybciaU,1083679,1089760,national committee as well as top  republican house leadership here up on  capitol hill this is largely a united
1GS2uybciaU,1089760,1095760,front here and they are pushing back on  this is a theater they're saying that  this is the same story that everybody
1GS2uybciaU,1095760,1101360,has been tuned into for the last year  and a half and they make the case ahead  of these midterms coming up in november
1GS2uybciaU,1101360,1108720,that while democrats are focused on  january 6 they're focused on issues like  inflation gas prices and the baby
1GS2uybciaU,1108720,1114559,formula shortage here those are the  issues that they are focused on and that  is what they're going to try to drive  home in these weeks ahead during these
1GS2uybciaU,1114559,1120799,hearings one of the leaders of this  committee is one of the heads of the  committee of course is liz chaney a  republican representative from wyoming
1GS2uybciaU,1120799,1126160,and she has not stopped since she has  started right and and the more evidence  she has seen the more subpoenas that
1GS2uybciaU,1126160,1132559,have come through the more  interviews they've had she has stayed  pretty sort of straight in that she is
1GS2uybciaU,1132559,1138320,not wavering at all in this and she's  come under a lot of attacks and you were  in wyoming and what did you find there
1GS2uybciaU,1138320,1144320,yeah i mean i found a lot of wyoming  republicans who were calling her traitor  i think we actually got a couple of them
1GS2uybciaU,1144320,1150880,on tape that we could play okay  why not liz cheney
1GS2uybciaU,1150880,1156080,she's a traitor he's liz janey yeah  she's a traitor the big question harriet
1GS2uybciaU,1156080,1161840,hageman or liz chaney oh hey  no question why not liz cheney because
1GS2uybciaU,1161840,1167200,she's a sellout yes betrayal  you heard that traitor over and over
1GS2uybciaU,1167200,1173360,traitor traitor betrayal that's her home  state her dad dick cheney was first  elected to congress in wyoming more than
1GS2uybciaU,1173360,1179520,four decades ago she is getting a  primary challenge by a woman harriet  hageman she's an attorney long-time gop
1GS2uybciaU,1179520,1185360,activist in the state that primary is  just over two months away again when we  look at the republican party there are
1GS2uybciaU,1185360,1191840,so few individuals who are forcefully  speaking out against donald trump and  what took place on january 6th adam
1GS2uybciaU,1191840,1197120,kinzinger tom rice liz cheney it's a  very small group do you think liz cheney  is going to lose that primary race
1GS2uybciaU,1197120,1203360,because of her stance here she's looking  at a very tough competition and a  potential loss in august we got to get  to a quick break vaughn hillard we

1GS2uybciaU,1344880,1349919,and welcome back we are looking at a  live look right now at a house committee  room as uh we are less than 10 minutes
1GS2uybciaU,1349919,1356080,away from this hearing getting underway  on the january 6 capital riot and the  prime time hearing the decision by the
1GS2uybciaU,1356080,1362159,january 6 select committee to hold a  prime time televised hearing is not one  without implications so what are those
1GS2uybciaU,1362159,1367760,political implications for both  republicans and democrats nbc news  political director chuck todd joins us
1GS2uybciaU,1367760,1373440,now chuck are democrats gambling here  asking for prime time hours sort of
1GS2uybciaU,1373440,1378640,building up this some people may say  spectacle and and not be able to deliver
1GS2uybciaU,1378640,1383919,or do are they so confident that what  they're going to show and what americans  are going to hear is is going to put the
1GS2uybciaU,1383919,1389679,january 6 rights back at the forefront  of the american psyche  well i guess i would take door number
1GS2uybciaU,1389679,1395440,three tom and just say if they if they  didn't push for a prime time hearing if  they didn't push for the biggest
1GS2uybciaU,1395440,1401120,possible platform then what are they  doing meaning is their inve you know  they keep telling us how much they keep
1GS2uybciaU,1401120,1408480,finding they keep telling us how  important this investigation is so i  guess i would look at it from the  perspective of if they didn't try to get
1GS2uybciaU,1408480,1415520,this in prime time  then what are they doing then you know  it  if it is the level of seriousness that i
1GS2uybciaU,1415520,1421919,think you and i believe it is and  certainly those folks on the committee i  mean i think you you have to uh
1GS2uybciaU,1421919,1427679,sort of make your case on the biggest  stage possible so look i am i'll tell  you one thing that has surprised me
1GS2uybciaU,1427679,1433520,though tom is the  the fact that you've had some members of  this committee including jamie raskin
1GS2uybciaU,1433520,1440400,basically saying this is going to be a  blockbuster you're like okay  yeah because usually in politics they  lower the bar usually in politics they
1GS2uybciaU,1440400,1446400,lower the bar  these guys aren't doing it and i you  know look i do think i worry about a
1GS2uybciaU,1446400,1452000,couple things with these hearings  tonight i worry number one that the  country is just numb
1GS2uybciaU,1452000,1458400,to to uh instability these days right  we've been dealing with constant crises  in this country for seven years
1GS2uybciaU,1458400,1463440,you know and every day there's a new  crisis so i don't know  something that should rattle us may not
1GS2uybciaU,1463440,1470000,rattle us right that's number one and  then the second impediment i think this  committee is facing  is a number that you and i talked about
1GS2uybciaU,1470000,1475840,i think earlier this week and i was i  was pretty fired up about and that was  the the percentage of americans who
1GS2uybciaU,1475840,1481279,believe that that people who run for  office are just doing it for  self-serving purposes
1GS2uybciaU,1481279,1486880,and only 20 of the public thinks people  run for office to do the greater good
1GS2uybciaU,1486880,1492400,so  how am i you know  this poor committee whatever you no  matter what your politics is they start
1GS2uybciaU,1492400,1498000,out with incredibly low credibility  simply because they're elected officials  that's how bad our
1GS2uybciaU,1498000,1504799,our politics is right now how much the  public in general is leery and  distrustful so
1GS2uybciaU,1504799,1511039,this to me puts this committee they got  to show their receipts they got to not  just show us a good show they got to
1GS2uybciaU,1511039,1517360,show the receipts and have them all  documented to have a chance at a  skeptical american public to soak it in
1GS2uybciaU,1517360,1523120,so chuck the latest because you  mentioned a poll the latest nbc news  poll reveals that i think we have the  numbers here that that the american
1GS2uybciaU,1523120,1528799,public does not hold the former  president responsible for these attacks  anymore a majority of those people that
1GS2uybciaU,1528799,1535039,were pulled the needle has shifted since  january i think only 17 percent hold  them solely responsible uh here's the
1GS2uybciaU,1535039,1542080,poll right here 18 somewhat responsible  and if you look you know with how those  numbers are changing my question is did
1GS2uybciaU,1542080,1548640,this did this committee wait too long  chuck to have this night is it too late  because republicans are already out with
1GS2uybciaU,1548640,1553679,their oppo saying why isn't there an  inflation hearing why isn't there a gas  price prime time hearing so i'm
1GS2uybciaU,1553679,1559200,wondering about the timing tonight well  look i'm with you tom i think this is  something that should have been last uh
1GS2uybciaU,1559200,1566240,at the end of the fall or the beginning  of the winter in calendar year 2021  right something you know i i if but of
1GS2uybciaU,1566240,1572080,course this took a while had we had a  bipartisan commission i mean let's go  back in time here a little bit the
1GS2uybciaU,1572080,1578320,biggest regret that i think many people  have including those on that committee  is that this isn't
1GS2uybciaU,1578320,1585039,a bipartisan commission  uh a la  the 911 commission or the iraq war study
1GS2uybciaU,1585039,1591919,group or the warren commission you know  you could have had condoleezza rice and  tom daschle right former democratic
1GS2uybciaU,1591919,1598400,senate majority leader former republican  secretary of state you know and i'm just  picking those two people right now could  have been you know you could have had al
1GS2uybciaU,1598400,1604480,gore and connie rice you could have had  you know uh uh other just two  secretaries of state do it but the point
1GS2uybciaU,1604480,1609600,is there there was a way that this could  have been done with a ton of bipartisan
1GS2uybciaU,1609600,1616880,credibility and the republicans shut it  down right mitch mcconnell decided not  to do this uh and i just think it was a
1GS2uybciaU,1616880,1621919,it that to me is the biggest regret of  all of this because i think this is  important information and i do think too
1GS2uybciaU,1621919,1627520,many people are going to view it with  through a political and it's interesting  because that first poll you mentioned  liz cheney we were just talking to von
1GS2uybciaU,1627520,1633600,hilliard earlier likely to lose her seat  because she's standing on her what she  believes are her principles and she
1GS2uybciaU,1633600,1640559,believes in this committee and it could  cost her her own seat uh chuck todd we  know you're going to be with the entire  nbc news team throughout the coverage of

1GS2uybciaU,1802480,1808960,question no comment he is in bedminster  new jersey at his private golf club  of course donald trump has hinged his
1GS2uybciaU,1808960,1814240,whole potential 2024 presidential  campaign on the idea that 2020 was taken
1GS2uybciaU,1814240,1819600,from him that that election was stolen  and rigged which ultimately gave us  january 6. and real quick remind all of
1GS2uybciaU,1819600,1826399,our viewers all the trump insiders and  family members that have testified  don jr ivanka the list goes on and on
1GS2uybciaU,1826399,1833279,ronna mcdaniel the rnc chairwoman she  has even voluntarily taken part in this  the question is what did they get from

1GS2uybciaU,1882000,1887039,tonight  as the january 6 committee seeks to  answer
1GS2uybciaU,1887039,1895279,who is to blame for the assault on the  nation's capital  here now is lester holt
1GS2uybciaU,1895279,1900799,good evening it was the worst attack on  our nation's capital in more than 200  years and it is one of the most
1GS2uybciaU,1900799,1905919,documented events in american history  the insurrection of january 6 played out
1GS2uybciaU,1905919,1912080,live on tv  and since then even more chilling videos  have emerged of rioters overpowering
1GS2uybciaU,1912080,1919440,capitol police and storming the halls of  congress but there is still so much we  do not yet know about that day
1GS2uybciaU,1919440,1926000,tonight the january 6 committee will try  to make the case that former president  donald trump was directly responsible
1GS2uybciaU,1926000,1931600,for those events as part of an effort to  overturn the results of the 2020  election
1GS2uybciaU,1931600,1939039,these hearings are a result of a  year-long investigation by the january 6  committee it has issued nearly 100
1GS2uybciaU,1939039,1945760,subpoenas and interviewed more than a  thousand witnesses some from former  president trump's inner circle both his
1GS2uybciaU,1945760,1950880,daughter ivanka trump and son-in-law  jared kushner were interviewed we expect
1GS2uybciaU,1950880,1956000,to see clips of some of those interviews  tonight  we also expect to see new videos from
1GS2uybciaU,1956000,1963200,the moments of the attack we have been  told some are quite graphic and some  contain explicit language so warning to
1GS2uybciaU,1963200,1969279,our viewers we will air what is  displayed by the committee  much of the focus will be on president
1GS2uybciaU,1969279,1976880,trump his false claims that the election  was stolen what he said at a rally in  the hours leading up to the attack and
1GS2uybciaU,1976880,1983760,his actions while the assault was  underway mr trump and his allies have  described these hearings as a partisan
1GS2uybciaU,1983760,1988880,witch-hunt democrats do lead the  committee alongside only two republicans
1GS2uybciaU,1988880,1995200,both of them had previously voted to  impeach the former president  we should know this is not a legal
1GS2uybciaU,1995200,2001919,proceeding no one is on trial the  committee says the goal is to learn what  happened so it never happens again
1GS2uybciaU,2001919,2008399,tonight we're told will serve as a sort  of opening argument the first in a  series of hearings that will be very
1GS2uybciaU,2008399,2014559,different than traditional congressional  hearings the committee has hired a  television consultant to help produce it
1GS2uybciaU,2014559,2021200,for a prime time audience so while it  will begin with opening statements from  the chairman democrat benny thompson and
1GS2uybciaU,2021200,2027919,vice chair republican liz chaney even  those statements will have video  components our teams are standing by for
1GS2uybciaU,2027919,2033279,full coverage of this historic hearing  but let's take you inside the hearing  room now where chairman thompson is

1GS2uybciaU,2099280,2105040,all of us have one thing in common  we swore the same oath
1GS2uybciaU,2105040,2112640,that same oath that all members of  congress take upon taking office and  afterwards every two years if they are
1GS2uybciaU,2112640,2117839,reelected  we swore an oath to defend the  constitution
1GS2uybciaU,2117839,2123599,against all enemies  foreign  and domestic
1GS2uybciaU,2123599,2129040,the words of the current oath taken by  all of us  that nearly every united states
1GS2uybciaU,2129040,2134079,government employee takes  have their roots in the civil war
1GS2uybciaU,2134079,2139520,throughout our history the united states  has fought against foreign enemies to
1GS2uybciaU,2139520,2144800,preserve our democracy electoral system  and country
1GS2uybciaU,2144800,2150320,when the united states capital was  stormed and burned in 1814
1GS2uybciaU,2150320,2158240,foreign enemies were responsible  after war in 1862 when american citizens
1GS2uybciaU,2158240,2164640,had taken up arms against this country  congress adopted a new oath to help make
1GS2uybciaU,2164640,2170079,sure no person who had supported the  rebellion could hold a position of
1GS2uybciaU,2170079,2177520,public trust  therefore  congresspersons and united states  federal government employees were
1GS2uybciaU,2177520,2183920,required for the first time  to swear an oath to defend the  constitution
1GS2uybciaU,2183920,2191920,against all enemies foreign and domestic  that oath was put to test on january 6
1GS2uybciaU,2191920,2197760,2021  the police officers who held the line  that day
1GS2uybciaU,2197760,2204079,honored their oath  many came out of that day  blooded and broken
1GS2uybciaU,2204079,2211280,they still bear those wounds visible and  invisible  they did their duty
1GS2uybciaU,2211280,2216640,they repel the mob and ended the  occupation of the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,2216640,2224400,they defended the constitution against  domestic enemies  so that congress could return
1GS2uybciaU,2224400,2231119,uphold our own oath  and count your votes to ensure the  transfer of power
1GS2uybciaU,2231119,2238160,just as we've done for hundreds of years  but unlike in 1814
1GS2uybciaU,2238160,2243839,it was domestic enemies of the  constitution who stormed the capital and
1GS2uybciaU,2243839,2249040,occupied the capital  who sought to throt the will of the  people
1GS2uybciaU,2249040,2255280,to stop the transfer of power  and so they did so at the encouragement
1GS2uybciaU,2255280,2260640,of the president of the united states  the president of the united states
1GS2uybciaU,2260640,2268240,trying to stop the transfer of power  a precedent that had stood for 220 years
1GS2uybciaU,2268240,2273760,even as our democracy had faced its most  difficult test
1GS2uybciaU,2273760,2279040,thinking back again to the civil war  in the summer of 1864
1GS2uybciaU,2279040,2284720,the president of the united states  believed he would be
1GS2uybciaU,2284720,2290880,doomed to bid his bid for reelection  he believed his opponent
1GS2uybciaU,2290880,2295920,general george mcclellan  would wave the white flag when it came
1GS2uybciaU,2295920,2302079,to preserving the union but even with  that grim fate hanging in the balance
1GS2uybciaU,2302079,2308400,president lincoln was ready to accept  the will of the voters  come what may
1GS2uybciaU,2308400,2313440,he made a quiet pledge  he wrote down the words
1GS2uybciaU,2313440,2320720,this morning  as for some days past  it seems exceedingly probable that this
1GS2uybciaU,2320720,2327680,administration will not be reelected  then it will be my duty to so cooperate
1GS2uybciaU,2327680,2332960,with the president-elect  it will be my duty
1GS2uybciaU,2332960,2338839,lincoln sealed that memo and asked his  cabinet secretaries to sign it sight
1GS2uybciaU,2338839,2344480,unseen he asked them to make the same  commitment he did
1GS2uybciaU,2344480,2350400,to accept defeat  if indeed defeat was the will of the  people
1GS2uybciaU,2350400,2355520,to uphold the rule of law  to do whatever president who came before
1GS2uybciaU,2355520,2361119,him did  and what every president who followed  him would do
1GS2uybciaU,2361119,2369599,until donald trump  donald trump lost the presidential  election in 2020 the american people
1GS2uybciaU,2369599,2375280,voted him out of office  it was not because of a rigged system
1GS2uybciaU,2375280,2380880,it was not because of voter fraud  don't believe me
1GS2uybciaU,2380880,2388560,hear what his former attorney general  had to say about it  i warned those who watching
1GS2uybciaU,2388560,2394760,that this connect contains strong  language
1GS2uybciaU,2396160,2402480,no just what i've i've been i've had i  had three discussions with the president  that i can recall one was on november
1GS2uybciaU,2402480,2409119,23rd  one was on december first and one was on  december 14th and i've been through
1GS2uybciaU,2409119,2415200,sort of the give and take of those  discussions and in that context i made  it clear i did not agree with
1GS2uybciaU,2415200,2421040,the idea of saying the election was  stolen and putting out this stuff which  i told the president was
1GS2uybciaU,2421040,2426560,and uh  you know i didn't want to be a part of  it and that's one of the reasons that
1GS2uybciaU,2426560,2433200,went into me deciding to leave when i  did i  observed uh i think it was on december
1GS2uybciaU,2433200,2439280,1st that you know how can we you can't  live in a world where where the  incumbent administration stays in power
1GS2uybciaU,2439280,2445760,based on its view  unsupported by specific evidence  that the election that there was fraud
1GS2uybciaU,2445760,2452319,in the election  bill bar on election day 2020 he was the
1GS2uybciaU,2452319,2457839,attorney general of the united states  the top law enforcement official in the
1GS2uybciaU,2457839,2463839,country  telling the president exactly what he  thought about claims of a stolen
1GS2uybciaU,2463839,2469359,election  donald trump had his days in court to  challenge the results
1GS2uybciaU,2469359,2475200,he was within his rights to seek those  judgment  in the united states
1GS2uybciaU,2475200,2481200,law-abiding citizens have those tools  for pursuing justice he lost in the
1GS2uybciaU,2481200,2486800,courts just as he did at the ballot box  and in this country
1GS2uybciaU,2486800,2493280,that's the end of the line  but for donald trump  that was only the beginning of what
1GS2uybciaU,2493280,2499440,became a sprawling multi-step conspiracy  aimed at overturning the presidential
1GS2uybciaU,2499440,2506000,election  aimed at throwing out the votes of  millions of americans your votes
1GS2uybciaU,2506000,2511040,your voice in our democracy and  replacing the will of the american
1GS2uybciaU,2511040,2517440,people with his will to remain in power  after his turn ended
1GS2uybciaU,2517440,2524800,donald trump was at the center of this  conspiracy  and ultimately donald trump the
1GS2uybciaU,2524800,2530000,president of the united states  spurred a mob of domestic enemies of the
1GS2uybciaU,2530000,2536720,constitution  to march down the capitol and subvert  american democracy
1GS2uybciaU,2536720,2541760,any legal jargon you hear about  seditious conspiracy
1GS2uybciaU,2541760,2548319,obstruction of an official proceeding  conspiracy to defraud the united states
1GS2uybciaU,2548319,2553680,boils down to this  january 6 was the culmination of an
1GS2uybciaU,2553680,2559280,attempted coup  a brazen attempt as one riot to put it
1GS2uybciaU,2559280,2566480,shortly after january 6 to overthrow the  government the violence was no accident
1GS2uybciaU,2566480,2573119,it represents  senate trump's last stand  most desperate chance to halt the
1GS2uybciaU,2573119,2580240,transfer of power  now you may hear those words and think  this is just another political attack on
1GS2uybciaU,2580240,2585839,donald trump  by people who don't like him  that's not the case
1GS2uybciaU,2585839,2593119,my colleagues and i all wanted an  outside independent commission  to investigate january 6
1GS2uybciaU,2593119,2600319,similar to what we had  after 9 11.  but after first agreeing to the idea
1GS2uybciaU,2600319,2605680,donald trump's allies in congress put a  stop to it  apparently
1GS2uybciaU,2605680,2613040,they don't want january 6 investigated  at all  and in the last 17 months many of those
1GS2uybciaU,2613040,2618880,same people have tried to whitewash what  happened on january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,2618880,2627200,to rewrite history  call it a tourist visit  label it legitimate political discourse
1GS2uybciaU,2627200,2632800,donald trump and his followers have  adopted the words of the songwriter
1GS2uybciaU,2632800,2639040,do you believe me  or your lying eyes  we can't sweep what happened
1GS2uybciaU,2639040,2645119,under the rug  the american people deserve answers  so i come before you
1GS2uybciaU,2645119,2651359,this evening not as a democrat but as an  american who swore an oath to defend the
1GS2uybciaU,2651359,2658160,constitution  the constitution doesn't protect just  democrats or just republicans
1GS2uybciaU,2658160,2664079,it protects all of us  we the people  and this scheme was an attempt to
1GS2uybciaU,2664079,2671040,undermine the will of the people  so tonight  and over the next few weeks
1GS2uybciaU,2671040,2677839,we're going to remind you of the reality  of what happened that day but our work
1GS2uybciaU,2677839,2683599,must do much more than just look  backwards  because of our democracy remains in
1GS2uybciaU,2683599,2689200,danger  the conspiracy to thought the will of  the people is not over
1GS2uybciaU,2689200,2694960,there are those in this audience who  thirst for power but have no love or
1GS2uybciaU,2694960,2700480,respect for what makes america great  devotion to the constitution
1GS2uybciaU,2700480,2706000,allegiance to the rule of law  a shared journey to build a more perfect
1GS2uybciaU,2706000,2711440,union  january 6th and the lies that led
1GS2uybciaU,2711440,2718160,to insurrection have put two and a half  centuries of constitutional democracy at
1GS2uybciaU,2718160,2725920,risk  the world is watching what we do here  america has long been expected to be a
1GS2uybciaU,2725920,2732480,shining city on the hill  a beacon of hope and freedom  a model for others
1GS2uybciaU,2732480,2737520,when we are at our best  how can we play that role when our house
1GS2uybciaU,2737520,2742720,is in such disorder  we must confront the truth with candor
1GS2uybciaU,2742720,2750400,resolve and determination  we need to show that we are worthy of  the gifts that are the birthright of
1GS2uybciaU,2750400,2758079,every american  that begins here and it begins now  with a true accounting of what happened
1GS2uybciaU,2758079,2764240,and what led to the attack  on our constitution and our democracy
1GS2uybciaU,2764240,2771680,in this moment  when the dangers of our constitution and  our democracy loom large nothing could
1GS2uybciaU,2771680,2779280,be more important  working alongside the public servants on  this diaz has been one of the greatest
1GS2uybciaU,2779280,2784480,honors of my time in congress  it's been a particular privilege to
1GS2uybciaU,2784480,2792640,count as a partner in this effort  and to count as a friend  the gentlewoman from wyoming miss cheney
1GS2uybciaU,2792640,2799839,she's a patriot  a public servant of profound courage of  devotion to her oath and the
1GS2uybciaU,2799839,2807440,constitution  it's my pleasure to recognize ms cheney  for her opening statement
1GS2uybciaU,2807440,2814560,thank you very much mr chairman and let  me echo uh those words about the  importance of bipartisanship and what a
1GS2uybciaU,2814560,2822640,tremendous honor it is to work on this  committee  mr chairman at 6 01 p.m on january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,2822640,2828079,after he spent hours watching a violent  mob besiege attack and invade our
1GS2uybciaU,2828079,2833520,capital  donald trump tweeted  but he did not condemn the attack
1GS2uybciaU,2833520,2838560,instead he justified it  these are the things and events that
1GS2uybciaU,2838560,2844400,happen he said when a sacred landslide  election victory is so unceremoniously
1GS2uybciaU,2844400,2849760,and viciously stripped away from great  patriots who've been badly and unfairly
1GS2uybciaU,2849760,2854960,treated for so long  as you will see in the hearings to come
1GS2uybciaU,2854960,2860240,president trump believed his supporters  at the capitol and i quote
1GS2uybciaU,2860240,2868000,were doing what they should be doing  this is what he told his staff as they  pleaded with him to call off the mob to
1GS2uybciaU,2868000,2875680,instruct his supporters to leave  over a series of hearings in the coming  weeks you will hear testimony live and
1GS2uybciaU,2875680,2880720,on video from more than half a dozen  former white house staff in the trump
1GS2uybciaU,2880720,2886800,administration  all of whom were in the west wing of the  white house on january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,2886800,2892720,you will hear testimony that quote the  president did not really want to put  anything out
1GS2uybciaU,2892720,2898640,calling off the riot or asking his  supporters to leave  you will hear that president trump was
1GS2uybciaU,2898640,2903920,yelling and quote  really angry at advisers who told him he
1GS2uybciaU,2903920,2909040,needed to be doing something more  and aware of the rioters chance to hang
1GS2uybciaU,2909040,2914640,mike pence the president responded with  this sentiment quote maybe our
1GS2uybciaU,2914640,2921440,supporters have the right idea  mike pence quote deserves it
1GS2uybciaU,2921440,2928960,you will hear evidence that president  trump refused for hours to do what his  staff his family and many of his other
1GS2uybciaU,2928960,2936960,advisors begged him to do  immediately instruct his supporters to  stand down and evacuate the capital
1GS2uybciaU,2936960,2942800,tonight  you will see never before seen footage  of the brutal attack on our capital
1GS2uybciaU,2942800,2948640,an attack that unfolded while a few  blocks away president trump sat watching

1GS2uybciaU,2955280,2962400,police officers  battling for their lives and ours  fighting to defend our democracy
1GS2uybciaU,2962400,2967520,against a violent mob donald trump  refused to call off
1GS2uybciaU,2967520,2975119,tonight and in the weeks to come you  will see evidence of what motivated this  violence including directly from those
1GS2uybciaU,2975119,2982000,who participated in this attack  you will see video of them explaining  what caused them to do it
1GS2uybciaU,2982000,2988240,you will see their posts on social media  we will show you what they have said in  federal court
1GS2uybciaU,2988240,2993920,on this point there is no room for  debate  those who invaded our capital and
1GS2uybciaU,2993920,2999839,battled law enforcement for hours were  motivated by what president trump had  told them
1GS2uybciaU,2999839,3006720,that the election was stolen and that he  was the rightful president  president trump summoned the mob
1GS2uybciaU,3006720,3013200,assembled the mob and lit the flame of  this attack  you will also hear about plots to commit
1GS2uybciaU,3013200,3018720,seditious conspiracy on january 6th  a crime defined in our laws as
1GS2uybciaU,3018720,3024800,conspiring to overthrow put down or  destroy by force the government of the
1GS2uybciaU,3024800,3030559,united states  or to oppose by force the authority  thereof
1GS2uybciaU,3030559,3036960,multiple members of two groups the oath  keepers and the proud boys have been  charged with this crime for their
1GS2uybciaU,3036960,3043599,involvement in the events leading up to  and on january 6th  some have pled guilty
1GS2uybciaU,3043599,3050720,the attack on our capital was not a  spontaneous riot  intelligence available before january 6
1GS2uybciaU,3050720,3057280,identified plans to quote invade the  capital  occupy the capital and take other steps
1GS2uybciaU,3057280,3064400,to halt congress's count of electoral  votes that day  in our hearings to come we will identify
1GS2uybciaU,3064400,3071280,elements of those plans and we will show  specifically how a group of proud boys  led a mob into the capitol building on
1GS2uybciaU,3071280,3078240,january 6th  tonight i am going to describe for you  some of what our committee has learned
1GS2uybciaU,3078240,3083440,and highlight initial findings you will  see this month in our hearings
1GS2uybciaU,3083440,3089839,as you hear this  all americans should keep in fact in  mind this fact
1GS2uybciaU,3089839,3095119,on the morning of january 6th  president donald trump's intention was
1GS2uybciaU,3095119,3101040,to remain president of the united states  despite the lawful outcome of the 2020
1GS2uybciaU,3101040,3108559,election  and in violation of his constitutional  obligation to relinquish power
1GS2uybciaU,3108559,3114319,over multiple months donald trump  oversaw  and coordinated a sophisticated
1GS2uybciaU,3114319,3120960,seven-part plan to overturn the  presidential election and prevent the  transfer of presidential power
1GS2uybciaU,3120960,3126160,in our hearings you will see evidence of  each element of this plan
1GS2uybciaU,3126160,3133760,in our second hearing you will see that  donald trump and his advisors knew  that he had in fact lost the election
1GS2uybciaU,3133760,3139839,but despite this president trump engaged  in a massive effort to spread false and
1GS2uybciaU,3139839,3146800,fraudulent information  to convince huge portions of the u.s  population that fraud had stolen the
1GS2uybciaU,3146800,3152800,election from him  this was not true  jason miller was a senior trump campaign
1GS2uybciaU,3152800,3160480,spokesman  in this clip  miller describes a call between the  trump campaign's internal data expert
1GS2uybciaU,3160480,3166599,and president trump a few days after the  2020 election
1GS2uybciaU,3168160,3173680,i was in the oval office  um  and
1GS2uybciaU,3173680,3180720,at some point in the conversation matt  oskowski who is the lead data person was  brought on and
1GS2uybciaU,3180720,3187839,i remember he delivered to the president  pretty blunt terms  that he was going to lose
1GS2uybciaU,3187839,3193760,and that was based on mr miller on  madd and the data team's assessment of
1GS2uybciaU,3193760,3199599,the sort of county by county state by  state  results as reported
1GS2uybciaU,3199599,3205440,correct  alex cannon was one of president trump's
1GS2uybciaU,3205440,3211599,campaign lawyers he previously worked  for the trump organization  one of his responsibilities was to
1GS2uybciaU,3211599,3218079,assess allegations of election fraud in  november 2020.  here is one sample of his testimony
1GS2uybciaU,3218079,3224319,discussing what he told white house  chief of staff mark meadows
1GS2uybciaU,3226720,3231839,i remember  a call all  with
1GS2uybciaU,3231839,3238000,mr meadows  where mr meadows was asking me what i  was finding and if i was finding
1GS2uybciaU,3238000,3243760,anything  and i remember sharing with him that  we weren't finding anything
1GS2uybciaU,3243760,3249839,that would be  sufficient to  change the results in any of the key
1GS2uybciaU,3249839,3255680,states  when was that conversation  probably in november
1GS2uybciaU,3255680,3260800,mid to late november i think it was  before my child was born  and what was mr meadow's reaction to
1GS2uybciaU,3260800,3267680,that information  i believe the words he used were so  there's no there there
1GS2uybciaU,3267680,3274880,there's no there there  the trump campaign's general counsel  matt morgan gave similar testimony
1GS2uybciaU,3274880,3282240,he explained that all of the fraud  allegations and the campaign's other  election arguments taken together
1GS2uybciaU,3282240,3289839,and viewed in the best possible light  for president trump could still not  change the outcome of the election
1GS2uybciaU,3289839,3297200,president trump's attorney general bill  barr also told donald trump his election  claims were wrong
1GS2uybciaU,3299760,3305200,repeatedly  told the president in no uncertain terms
1GS2uybciaU,3305200,3310960,that  i did not see evidence of fraud
1GS2uybciaU,3310960,3316079,and you know that would have affected  the outcome of the election
1GS2uybciaU,3316079,3323280,and frankly a year and a half later i  haven't seen anything to change my mind  on that
1GS2uybciaU,3323520,3330079,attorney general barr also told  president trump that his allegations  about dominion voting machines were
1GS2uybciaU,3330079,3337280,groundless  i saw absolutely zero basis for the
1GS2uybciaU,3337280,3344000,allegations  but they were made in such a sensational  way  that they obviously were influencing a
1GS2uybciaU,3344000,3349680,lot of people  members of the public  that there was this systemic
1GS2uybciaU,3349680,3355119,corruption in the system and that their  votes didn't count and that these  machines controlled by somebody else
1GS2uybciaU,3355119,3360480,were actually determining it which was  complete nonsense  and it was being laid out there and i
1GS2uybciaU,3360480,3365680,told them that it was that it was uh  crazy stuff and they were wasting their
1GS2uybciaU,3365680,3372079,time on that  and  was doing a great grave disservice to  the country
1GS2uybciaU,3372079,3377359,but president trump persisted repeating  the false dominion allegations in public
1GS2uybciaU,3377359,3382480,at least a dozen more times even after  his attorney general told him they were
1GS2uybciaU,3382480,3387520,quote complete nonsense  and after barr's resignation on december
1GS2uybciaU,3387520,3392640,23rd the acting attorney general who  replaced him jeff rosen and the acting
1GS2uybciaU,3392640,3398240,deputy richard donahue told president  trump over and over again that the
1GS2uybciaU,3398240,3404319,evidence did not support allegations he  was making in public  many of president trump's white house
1GS2uybciaU,3404319,3410319,staff also recognized that the evidence  did not support the claims president  trump was making
1GS2uybciaU,3410319,3417440,this is the president's daughter  commenting on bill barr's statement that  the department found no fraud sufficient
1GS2uybciaU,3417440,3420960,to overturn the election
1GS2uybciaU,3422720,3429760,how did that affect your perspective  about the election when attorney general  barr made that statement  it affected my perspective
1GS2uybciaU,3429760,3435920,i respect attorney general bar  so i
1GS2uybciaU,3436079,3441520,accepted what he said was saying  as you will hear on monday the president
1GS2uybciaU,3441520,3449040,had every right to litigate his campaign  claims but he ultimately lost more than  60 cases in state and federal courts
1GS2uybciaU,3449040,3455599,the president's claims in the election  cases were so frivolous and unsupported  that the president's lead lawyer rudy
1GS2uybciaU,3455599,3461760,giuliani not only lost the lawsuits his  license to practice law was suspended
1GS2uybciaU,3461760,3466799,here's what the court said of mr  giuliani  giuliani
1GS2uybciaU,3466799,3474400,communicated demonstrably false and  misleading statements to courts  lawmakers and the public at large in his
1GS2uybciaU,3474400,3479680,capacity as lawyer for former president  donald j trump and the trump campaign in
1GS2uybciaU,3479680,3484720,connection with trump's failed effort at  reelection in 2020
1GS2uybciaU,3484720,3490079,as you will see in great detail in our  hearings president trump ignored the
1GS2uybciaU,3490079,3496799,rulings of our nation's courts  he ignored his own campaign leadership  his white house staff
1GS2uybciaU,3496799,3503680,many republican state officials he  ignored the department of justice and  the department of homeland security
1GS2uybciaU,3503680,3510559,president trump invested millions of  dollars of campaign funds purposely  spreading false information
1GS2uybciaU,3510559,3515920,running ads he knew were false  and convincing millions of americans
1GS2uybciaU,3515920,3522720,that the election was corrupt and that  he was the true president  as you will see this misinformation
1GS2uybciaU,3522720,3530480,campaign provoked the violence on  january 6th  in our third hearing you will see that
1GS2uybciaU,3530480,3536640,president trump corruptly planned to  replace the attorney general of the  united states
1GS2uybciaU,3536640,3542480,so the u.s justice department would  spread his false stolen election claims
1GS2uybciaU,3542480,3549040,in the days before january 6th president  trump told his top justice department  officials quote
1GS2uybciaU,3549040,3555599,just say the election was corrupt and  leave the rest to me and the republican  congressman
1GS2uybciaU,3555599,3561920,senior justice department officials men  he had appointed  told him they could not do that because
1GS2uybciaU,3561920,3567119,it was not true  so president trump decided to replace  them
1GS2uybciaU,3567119,3574000,he offered jeff clark an environmental  lawyer at the justice department the job  of acting attorney general
1GS2uybciaU,3574000,3580880,president trump wanted mr clark to take  a number of steps  including sending this letter to georgia
1GS2uybciaU,3580880,3588559,and five other states  saying the u.s department of justice had  quote  identified significant concerns that may
1GS2uybciaU,3588559,3594960,have impacted the outcome of the  election  this letter is a lie
1GS2uybciaU,3594960,3601599,the department of justice had in fact  repeatedly told president trump exactly  the opposite that they had investigated
1GS2uybciaU,3601599,3608480,his stolen election allegations and  found no credible fraud that could  impact the outcome of the election
1GS2uybciaU,3608480,3614960,this letter and others like it would  have urged multiple states  to withdraw their official and lawful
1GS2uybciaU,3614960,3622400,electoral votes for biden  acting deputy attorney general richard  donahue described jeff clark's letter
1GS2uybciaU,3622400,3628079,this way quote  this would be a grave step for the  department to take and could have
1GS2uybciaU,3628079,3634160,tremendous constitutional political and  social ramifications for this country
1GS2uybciaU,3634160,3639280,the committee agrees with mr donohue's  assessment  had clarke assumed the role of attorney
1GS2uybciaU,3639280,3644480,general in the days before january 6 and  issued these letters the ramifications
1GS2uybciaU,3644480,3649599,could indeed have been grave  mr donohue also said this about clark's
1GS2uybciaU,3649599,3655839,plan  and i recall toward the end saying what
1GS2uybciaU,3655839,3663119,you're proposing is nothing less than  the united states justice department  meddling in the outcome of a  presidential election
1GS2uybciaU,3663119,3668400,in our hearings you will hear firsthand  how the senior leadership of the  department of justice threatened to
1GS2uybciaU,3668400,3673520,resign  how the white house counsel threatened  to resign and how they confronted donald
1GS2uybciaU,3673520,3680799,trump and jeff clark in the oval office  the men involved including acting  attorney general jeff rosen and acting
1GS2uybciaU,3680799,3687760,deputy attorney general richard donahue  were appointed by president trump these  men honored their oaths of office they
1GS2uybciaU,3687760,3694319,did their duty and you will hear from  them in our hearings  by contrast jeff clark has invoked his
1GS2uybciaU,3694319,3699680,fifth amendment privilege against  self-incrimination and refused to  testify
1GS2uybciaU,3699680,3706160,representative scott perry who was also  involved in trying to get clark  appointed as attorney general has
1GS2uybciaU,3706160,3712079,refused to testify here  as you will see  representative perry contacted the white
1GS2uybciaU,3712079,3717599,house in the weeks after january 6  to seek a presidential pardon
1GS2uybciaU,3717599,3724720,multiple other republican congressmen  also sought presidential pardons for  their roles in attempting to overturn
1GS2uybciaU,3724720,3731119,the 2020 election  in our fourth hearing we will focus on  president trump's efforts to pressure
1GS2uybciaU,3731119,3736799,vice president mike pence to refuse to  count electoral votes on january 6.
1GS2uybciaU,3736799,3741838,vice president pence has spoken publicly  about this
1GS2uybciaU,3743280,3750480,president trump is wrong  i had no right to overturn the election  the presidency belongs to the american
1GS2uybciaU,3750480,3755680,people and the american people alone  and frankly there is no idea more on
1GS2uybciaU,3755680,3761599,america  than the notion that any one person  could choose the american president
1GS2uybciaU,3761599,3767039,what president trump demanded that mike  pence do wasn't just wrong  it was illegal and it was
1GS2uybciaU,3767039,3772480,unconstitutional  you will hear this in great detail from  the vice president's former general
1GS2uybciaU,3772480,3778400,counsel  witnesses in these hearings will explain  how the former vice president and his
1GS2uybciaU,3778400,3784400,staff informed president trump over and  over again that what he was pressuring
1GS2uybciaU,3784400,3790079,mike pence to do was illegal  as you will hear president trump engaged
1GS2uybciaU,3790079,3795200,in a relentless effort to pressure pence  both in private and in public
1GS2uybciaU,3795200,3801440,you will see the evidence of that  pressure from multiple witnesses live  and on video
1GS2uybciaU,3801440,3808000,vice president pence demonstrated his  loyalty to donald trump consistently  over four years
1GS2uybciaU,3808000,3815119,but he knew that he had a higher duty to  the united states constitution  this is testimony from the vice
1GS2uybciaU,3815119,3818400,president's chief of staff
1GS2uybciaU,3820880,3827200,so i think the vice president was proud  of his four years of service and he felt  like a much had been accomplished in
1GS2uybciaU,3827200,3832799,those four years and i think he was  proud to have stood beside the president  for all that had been done but i think
1GS2uybciaU,3832799,3839520,he ultimately knew that his fidelity the  constitution was his first and foremost  oath and um and that's that's what he
1GS2uybciaU,3839520,3844960,articulated publicly and i think that  that's what he felt  his fidelity to the constitution was
1GS2uybciaU,3844960,3850880,more important than his fidelity to  president trump and his desire both he  took  yes
1GS2uybciaU,3850880,3856400,you'll also hear about a lawyer named  john eastman  mr eastman was deeply involved in
1GS2uybciaU,3856400,3862400,president trump's plans  you'll hear from former 4th circuit  federal judge michael luedig a highly
1GS2uybciaU,3862400,3868000,respected leading conservative judge  john eastman clerked for judge ludwig
1GS2uybciaU,3868000,3873440,judge ludig provided counsel to the vice  president's team in the days before  january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,3873440,3880799,the judge will explain how eastman quote  was wrong at every turn  and you will see the email exchanges
1GS2uybciaU,3880799,3887280,between eastman and the vice president's  council as the violent attack on  congress was underway
1GS2uybciaU,3887280,3893599,mr jacob said this to me mr eastman  thanks to your we are under
1GS2uybciaU,3893599,3899039,siege  you will also see evidence that john  eastman did not actually believe the
1GS2uybciaU,3899039,3904480,legal position he was taking in fact a  month before the 2020 election eastman
1GS2uybciaU,3904480,3910400,took exactly the opposite view on the  same legal issues  in the course of the select committee's
1GS2uybciaU,3910400,3917359,work to obtain information from mr  eastman we have had occasion to present  evidence to a federal judge
1GS2uybciaU,3917359,3923599,the judge evaluated the facts and he  reached the conclusion that president  trump's efforts to pressure vice
1GS2uybciaU,3923599,3929039,president pence to act illegally by  refusing to count electoral votes
1GS2uybciaU,3929039,3934079,likely violated two federal criminal  statutes
1GS2uybciaU,3934079,3939839,and the judge also said this  if dr eastman and president trump's plan
1GS2uybciaU,3939839,3945359,had worked it would have permanently  ended the peaceful transition of power
1GS2uybciaU,3945359,3950880,undermining american democracy and the  constitution  if the country does not commit to
1GS2uybciaU,3950880,3958720,investigating and pursuing  accountability for those responsible the  court fears january 6 will repeat itself
1GS2uybciaU,3958720,3965119,every american should read what this  federal judge has written  the same judge judge carter issued
1GS2uybciaU,3965119,3970240,another decision on tuesday night just  this week indicating that john eastman
1GS2uybciaU,3970240,3976960,and other trump lawyers knew that their  legal arguments had no real chance of  success in court but they relied on
1GS2uybciaU,3976960,3982960,those arguments anyway  to try to quote overturn a democratic  election
1GS2uybciaU,3982960,3989920,and you will hear that while congress  was under attack on january 6 and the  hours following the violence the trump
1GS2uybciaU,3989920,3996000,legal team in the willard hotel war room  continued to work to halt the count of
1GS2uybciaU,3996000,4001760,electoral votes  in our fifth hearing you will see  evidence that president trump corruptly
1GS2uybciaU,4001760,4007119,pressured state legislators and election  officials to change election results
1GS2uybciaU,4007119,4013760,you will hear additional details about  president trump's call to georgia  officials urging them to quote find
1GS2uybciaU,4013760,4018799,eleven thousand seven hundred and eighty  votes  votes that did not exist
1GS2uybciaU,4018799,4023920,and his efforts to get states to rescind  certified electoral slates
1GS2uybciaU,4023920,4029599,without factual basis and contrary to  law  you will hear new details about the
1GS2uybciaU,4029599,4036640,trump campaign and other trump  associates efforts to instruct  republican officials in multiple states
1GS2uybciaU,4036640,4043760,to create intentionally false electoral  slates and transmit those slates to  congress to the vice president and the
1GS2uybciaU,4043760,4051359,national archives falsely certifying  that trump won states he actually lost
1GS2uybciaU,4051359,4059359,in our final two june hearings you will  hear how president trump summoned a  violent mob and directed them illegally
1GS2uybciaU,4059359,4066400,to march on the united states capital  while the violence was underway  president trump failed to take immediate
1GS2uybciaU,4066400,4072160,action to stop the violence and instruct  his supporters to leave the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,4072160,4077359,as we present these initial findings  keep two points in mind first
1GS2uybciaU,4077359,4084000,our investigation is still ongoing so  what we make public here will not be the  complete set of information we will
1GS2uybciaU,4084000,4090160,ultimately disclose  and second the department of justice is  currently working with cooperating
1GS2uybciaU,4090160,4095760,witnesses and has disclosed to date only  some of the information it is identified
1GS2uybciaU,4095760,4102000,from encrypted communications and other  sources  on december 18 2020
1GS2uybciaU,4102000,4107359,a group including general michael flynn  sydney powell rudy giuliani and others
1GS2uybciaU,4107359,4113600,visited the white house  they stayed late into the evening  we know that the group discussed a
1GS2uybciaU,4113600,4120640,number of dramatic steps  including having the military seized  voting machines and potentially re-run
1GS2uybciaU,4120640,4126318,elections  you will also hear that president trump  met with that group alone for a period
1GS2uybciaU,4126318,4134238,of time before white house lawyers and  other staff discovered the group was  there and rushed to intervene
1GS2uybciaU,4134238,4139679,a little more than an hour after ms  powell mr giuliani general flynn and the
1GS2uybciaU,4139679,4145440,others finally left the white house  president trump sent the tweet on the
1GS2uybciaU,4145440,4151278,screen now  telling people to come to washington on  january sixth
1GS2uybciaU,4151278,4157278,be there he instructed them  will be wild  as you will see this was a pivotal
1GS2uybciaU,4157278,4163838,moment this tweet  initiated a chain of events the tweet  led to the planning for what occurred on
1GS2uybciaU,4163838,4171600,january 6th including by the proud boys  who ultimately led the invasion of the  capitol and the violence on that day
1GS2uybciaU,4171600,4178880,the indictment of a group of proud boys  alleges that they planned quote to  oppose by force the authority of the
1GS2uybciaU,4178880,4184159,government of the united states  and according to the department of  justice
1GS2uybciaU,4184159,4191120,on january 6 2021 the defendants  directed mobilized and led members of
1GS2uybciaU,4191120,4196560,the crowd onto the capitol grounds and  into the capitol  leading to the dismantling of metal
1GS2uybciaU,4196560,4204159,barricades the destruction of property  the breaching of the capitol building  and the assaults on law enforcement
1GS2uybciaU,4204159,4210640,although certain former trump officials  have argued that they did not anticipate  violence on january 6 the evidence
1GS2uybciaU,4210640,4216239,suggests otherwise  as you will see in our hearings the  white house was receiving specific
1GS2uybciaU,4216239,4221600,reports in the days leading up to  january 6th including during president
1GS2uybciaU,4221600,4228159,trump's ellipse rally  indicating that elements in the crowd  were preparing for violence at the
1GS2uybciaU,4228159,4235360,capitol  and on the evening of january 5th the  president's close advisor steve bannon
1GS2uybciaU,4235360,4239040,said this on his podcast
1GS2uybciaU,4240480,4245840,all hell is going to break loose  tomorrow just understand this all hell
1GS2uybciaU,4245840,4252000,is going to break loose tomorrow  as part of our investigation we will  present information about what the white
1GS2uybciaU,4252000,4259600,house and other intelligence agencies  knew  and why the capital was not better  prepared but we will not lose sight of
1GS2uybciaU,4259600,4264800,the fact that the capitol police did not  cause the crowd to attack
1GS2uybciaU,4264800,4271280,and we will not blame the violence that  day  violence provoked by donald trump on the
1GS2uybciaU,4271280,4277440,officers who bravely defended all of us  in our final hearing you will hear a
1GS2uybciaU,4277440,4285120,moment by moment account of the  hours-long attack from more than half a  dozen white house staff both live in the
1GS2uybciaU,4285120,4290480,hearing room and via videotaped  testimony  there's no doubt that president trump
1GS2uybciaU,4290480,4298320,was well aware of the violence as it  developed  white house staff urged president trump  to intervene and call off the mob
1GS2uybciaU,4298320,4304400,here is a document written while the  attack was underway by a member of the  white house staff
1GS2uybciaU,4304400,4311280,advising what the president needed to  say  quote anyone who entered the capitol  without proper authority should leave
1GS2uybciaU,4311280,4316960,immediately  this is exactly what his supporters on  capitol hill and nationwide were urging
1GS2uybciaU,4316960,4322000,the president to do  he would not  you will hear that leaders on capitol
1GS2uybciaU,4322000,4327600,hill begged the president for help  including republican leader mccarthy who
1GS2uybciaU,4327600,4333679,was quote scared  and called multiple members of president  trump's family after he could not
1GS2uybciaU,4333679,4340880,persuade the president himself  not only did president trump refuse to  tell the mob to leave the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,4340880,4346400,he placed no call to any element of the  united states government to instruct
1GS2uybciaU,4346400,4353280,that the capital be defended  he did not call his secretary of defense  on january 6th he did not talk to his
1GS2uybciaU,4353280,4360239,attorney general he did not talk to the  department of homeland security  president trump gave no order to deploy
1GS2uybciaU,4360239,4366960,the national guard that day and he made  no effort to work with the department of  justice to coordinate and displa and
1GS2uybciaU,4366960,4372480,deploy law enforcement  assets but vice president pence did each
1GS2uybciaU,4372480,4379520,of those things  for example  here is what general milley the chairman  of the joint chiefs of staff testified
1GS2uybciaU,4379520,4385440,to this  committee there were two or three calls
1GS2uybciaU,4385440,4390719,with vice president pence he was very  animated and he issued very explicit
1GS2uybciaU,4390719,4396320,uh  very  direct unambiguous orders
1GS2uybciaU,4396320,4402960,there was no question about that and he  was and and i can get to the exact  quotes i guess from some of our records
1GS2uybciaU,4402960,4408000,somewhere but he was very animated very  direct very firm
1GS2uybciaU,4408000,4415840,uh and to secretary miller get the  military down and get the guard down  here put down this uh situation uh et
1GS2uybciaU,4415840,4421760,cetera  by contrast here is general milley's  description of his conversation with
1GS2uybciaU,4421760,4427840,president trump's chief of staff mark  meadows on january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,4429360,4436159,he said  we have we have to kill the narrative  that the vice president is making
1GS2uybciaU,4436159,4442400,all the decisions  we need to establish the narrative
1GS2uybciaU,4442400,4448880,that  um  you know that the president is still in  charge and that
1GS2uybciaU,4448880,4455280,things are steady or stable or what's  happening  i immediately interpret that as politics  politics politics
1GS2uybciaU,4455280,4461440,red flag for me personally no action but  i remember distinctly
1GS2uybciaU,4461679,4468000,and you will hear from witnesses how the  day played out inside the white house  how multiple white house staff resigned
1GS2uybciaU,4468000,4473199,and discussed and how president trump  would not ask his supporters to leave  the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,4473199,4479440,it was only after multiple hours of  violence that president trump finally  released a video
1GS2uybciaU,4479440,4485280,instructing the riotous mob to leave and  as he did so he said to them quote we
1GS2uybciaU,4485280,4491120,love you and you're very special  you will also hear that in the immediate
1GS2uybciaU,4491120,4496640,aftermath of january 6th members of the  president's family white house staff
1GS2uybciaU,4496640,4504239,and others  tried to step in to stabilize the  situation quote to land the plane before
1GS2uybciaU,4504239,4510000,the presidential transition on january  20th  you will hear about members of the trump
1GS2uybciaU,4510000,4516800,cabinet discussing the possibility of  invoking the 25th amendment and  replacing the president of the united
1GS2uybciaU,4516800,4522640,states  multiple members of president trump's  own cabinet resigned immediately after
1GS2uybciaU,4522640,4528960,january 6th  one member of the cabinet suggested that  the remaining cabinet officers needed to
1GS2uybciaU,4528960,4534400,take a more active role in running the  white house and the administration
1GS2uybciaU,4534400,4539760,but most emblematic of those days is  this exchange of texts between sean
1GS2uybciaU,4539760,4545760,hannity and former president  trump's press secretary kaylee mcinanny
1GS2uybciaU,4545760,4551600,sean hannity wrote in part  key now  no more crazy people
1GS2uybciaU,4551600,4557280,no more stolen election talk  yes impeachment and 25th amendment are
1GS2uybciaU,4557280,4564080,real  many people will quit  ms mcaney responded in part love that
1GS2uybciaU,4564080,4569120,that's the playbook the white house  staff knew that president trump was
1GS2uybciaU,4569120,4575600,willing to entertain and use conspiracy  theories to achieve his ends  they knew the president needed to be cut
1GS2uybciaU,4575600,4582000,off from all of those who had encouraged  him  they knew that president donald trump
1GS2uybciaU,4582000,4587600,was too dangerous to be left alone  at least until he left office on january
1GS2uybciaU,4587600,4593040,20th  these are important facts for congress  and the american people to understand
1GS2uybciaU,4593040,4598640,fully when a president fails to take the  steps necessary to preserve our union or
1GS2uybciaU,4598640,4604159,worse causes a constitutional crisis  we're at a moment of maximum danger for
1GS2uybciaU,4604159,4610800,our republic  some in the white house took responsible  steps to try to prevent january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,4610800,4616320,others egged the president on  others who could have acted refused to
1GS2uybciaU,4616320,4623920,do so  in this case the white house counsel was  so concerned about potentially lawless
1GS2uybciaU,4623920,4631040,activity that he threatened to resign  multiple times  that is exceedingly rare and exceedingly
1GS2uybciaU,4631040,4636880,serious  it requires immediate attention  especially when the entire team
1GS2uybciaU,4636880,4643840,threatens to resign  however in the trump white house it was  not exceedingly rare and it was not
1GS2uybciaU,4643840,4650400,treated seriously  this is a clip of jared kushner  addressing multiple threats
1GS2uybciaU,4650400,4655600,by white house counsel pat sipoloni and  his team of lawyers to resign in the
1GS2uybciaU,4655600,4659280,weeks before january 6.
1GS2uybciaU,4660640,4668159,jared  are you aware of um instances where  pat cipolloni threatened to resign
1GS2uybciaU,4668159,4673440,i kind of like i said my interest at  that time was on trying to get as many  pardons done
1GS2uybciaU,4673440,4679840,and i know that you know he was always  to him and the team were always saying  oh we're going to resign we're not going  to be here if this happens if that
1GS2uybciaU,4679840,4686000,happens so  i kind of took it up to just be whining  to be honest with you
1GS2uybciaU,4686239,4691440,whining  there's a reason why people serving in  our government take an oath to the
1GS2uybciaU,4691440,4696719,constitution  as our founding fathers recognize  democracy is fragile
1GS2uybciaU,4696719,4703840,people in positions of public trust are  duty-bound to defend it to step forward  when action is required
1GS2uybciaU,4703840,4710239,in our country we don't swear an oath to  an individual or a political party we  take our oath to defend the united
1GS2uybciaU,4710239,4717920,states constitution  and that oath must mean something  tonight i say this to my republican
1GS2uybciaU,4717920,4723520,colleagues who are defending the  indefensible  there will come a day when donald trump
1GS2uybciaU,4723520,4730560,is gone  but your dishonor will remain  finally i ask all of our fellow
1GS2uybciaU,4730560,4736480,americans as you watch our hearings over  the coming weeks please remember what's  at stake
1GS2uybciaU,4736480,4742560,remember the men and women who have  fought and died so that we can live  under the rule of law not the rule of
1GS2uybciaU,4742560,4748640,men  i ask you to think of the scene in our  capital rotunda on the night of january
1GS2uybciaU,4748640,4753840,6th  there in a sacred space in our  constitutional republic

1GS2uybciaU,4788880,4795280,his commission  voluntarily relinquishing power  handing control of the continental army
1GS2uybciaU,4795280,4802080,back to congress  with this noble act washington set the  indispensable example of the peaceful
1GS2uybciaU,4802080,4807840,transfer of power  what president reagan called nothing  less than a miracle
1GS2uybciaU,4807840,4814800,the sacred obligation to defend this  peaceful transfer of power  has been honored by every american
1GS2uybciaU,4814800,4821360,president  except one  as americans we all have a duty to
1GS2uybciaU,4821360,4828560,ensure that what happened on january 6th  never happens again  to set aside partisan battles

1GS2uybciaU,5569199,5575280,pursuant to the order of the committee  of tonight  the chair declares the committee in
1GS2uybciaU,5575280,5581600,recess  for a period of approximately 10 minutes
1GS2uybciaU,5586800,5592560,and as you heard the committee now  taking that recess about 10 minutes the  estimation but there was a lot of
1GS2uybciaU,5592560,5598800,information here in that past hour as  the committee began to build their case  that former president trump was
1GS2uybciaU,5598800,5605520,responsible for the events of january 6.  first there was that dramatic newly  revealed video of the insurrection
1GS2uybciaU,5605520,5611600,underway  including an overhead angle showing  protesters storming the capitol and then
1GS2uybciaU,5611600,5618400,the violence played out on body cams and  other surveillance video they then made  their way up the steps and forced their
1GS2uybciaU,5618400,5623520,way inside  we should say let you know when that  video was played there were officers
1GS2uybciaU,5623520,5628840,inside the hearing room who were  watching and fighting back tears  sometimes
1GS2uybciaU,5628840,5635360,unsuccessfully next congresswoman liz  cheney presenting evidence that the  president was told repeatedly that he
1GS2uybciaU,5635360,5642320,lost the election but still continued to  say it was stolen she even played clips  from his inner circle including his
1GS2uybciaU,5642320,5647360,daughter and son-in-law testifying that  he was informed there was no fraud
1GS2uybciaU,5647360,5653199,and we heard from the chairman of the  joint chiefs at the time who testified  that while he heard from vice president
1GS2uybciaU,5653199,5659679,mike pence pleading for forces to be  sent in he never heard it from the  president our team is standing by to
1GS2uybciaU,5659679,5664960,break it all down during this break let  me first bring in our political director  and moderator of meet the press chuck
1GS2uybciaU,5664960,5672400,todd uh chuck as we noted at the  beginning of this this is not a criminal  proceeding  but there is a goal here among these
1GS2uybciaU,5672400,5678639,members of this committee have they  achieved it  well i think they're beginning they  certainly made it very powerful what i'd
1GS2uybciaU,5678639,5684000,call an opening statement if you will an  opening argument you know it struck me  lester you and i have
1GS2uybciaU,5684000,5689040,you and i have covered two impeachments  together of of then president trump
1GS2uybciaU,5689040,5696639,and in some ways this is the third  impeachment here  uh and  this is what happens when you get a year
1GS2uybciaU,5696639,5703360,to do investigations  uh and when you get his attorney general  on the record and you get his some of
1GS2uybciaU,5703360,5708560,his senior advisors on the record  as powerful as i think the jamie raskin
1GS2uybciaU,5708560,5714960,opening statement was and the second  impeachment that was essentially over  um the former president's role uh uh
1GS2uybciaU,5714960,5721520,right after january 6.  this is what happens when you get  another year of investigation you get
1GS2uybciaU,5721520,5728639,more of this evidence this takes what  was a powerful opening before  and i think brings it right to the
1GS2uybciaU,5728639,5735360,doorstep of the former president and i  think that's what made it and the other  thing that struck me about what they've  done so far both chairman thompson and
1GS2uybciaU,5735360,5741119,vice chair cheney is that they've been  they've been uh methodical about it
1GS2uybciaU,5741119,5748400,they've not been  they've not been  over charged about overheated they've
1GS2uybciaU,5748400,5754560,been stating the fact backing it up with  receipts i just think it's been a  powerful first hour and again if this
1GS2uybciaU,5754560,5761040,were if we were compared to the previous  actual impeachments that we've seen this  is easily the most powerful opening
1GS2uybciaU,5761040,5767119,we've had of the three and i think those  other two are pretty powerful  okay uh chuck as we stand by during this
1GS2uybciaU,5767119,5773440,period uh this break period let me turn  to washington uh senior washington  correspondent hallie jackson uh hallie
1GS2uybciaU,5773440,5779520,let me ask you about the this video we  saw a lot of these shots will seem  familiar to people but maybe from a
1GS2uybciaU,5779520,5785520,different angle uh so much to sort  through what struck you what should we  hone on in ho nina we've seen so much
1GS2uybciaU,5785520,5791840,footage at this point lester wright of  what happened on the day of the  insurrection we've seen it from people's  cell phone videos we've seen it from the
1GS2uybciaU,5791840,5798560,impeachment trials you and chuck were  just talking about the second  impeachment trial what was different  here these are some new angles right
1GS2uybciaU,5798560,5804080,some new perspectives of what happened  some of those higher angle shots for  example showing the rioters filling the
1GS2uybciaU,5804080,5810480,area outside the capitol before storming  the building you had the new audio in  some instances of what these officers
1GS2uybciaU,5810480,5816480,who were trying to defend the capital  were going to it just doesn't get any  easier to watch right and that i think
1GS2uybciaU,5816480,5822719,is what is is part and parcel of what  the committee wanted to get across now  there was that decision to show video of
1GS2uybciaU,5822719,5828960,not just house speaker nancy pelosi's  office but top house republican kevin  mccarthy's office too
1GS2uybciaU,5828960,5835119,and what was happening there that day  and then you had some new images too and  some audio from a documentarian
1GS2uybciaU,5835119,5840239,filmmaker a british guy named nick  quested you're actually going to hear  from him directly he's one of the  witnesses we'll hear from after the
1GS2uybciaU,5840239,5846400,break who was essentially filming the  proud boys so that's some of the footage  that is looks a little bit different
1GS2uybciaU,5846400,5853199,from some of the cell phone video that  you may have seen we heard from some of  the people there  somebody saying i'll lay down my life if
1GS2uybciaU,5853199,5858719,that would that's what it takes for  example so in some ways you're right  lester this is overall
1GS2uybciaU,5858719,5866480,somewhat familiar because we have seen  images like these before  but again it just doesn't get easier
1GS2uybciaU,5866480,5872400,hallie let me ask you about some of the  witness clips that were shown these uh  many of them were trump insiders his
1GS2uybciaU,5872400,5879119,daughter ivanka his former attorney  general how powerful was that how much  of that will we be seeing going forward
1GS2uybciaU,5879119,5885600,these are trump insiders right i mean to  the very level of ivanka trump and jared  kushner members of his family and by the
1GS2uybciaU,5885600,5891360,way official members of the white house  as senior advisors for example his  former attorney general bill barr jason
1GS2uybciaU,5891360,5896960,miller a top trump campaign advisor and  what was interesting here is first you
1GS2uybciaU,5896960,5904080,saw the committee cast this and this is  an important part of their argument here  as  trump insiders knowing they say that the
1GS2uybciaU,5904080,5911040,election fraud claims they were making  were not true knowing that in november  months before the january 6 insurrection
1GS2uybciaU,5911040,5916560,weeks before the insurrection happened  you also had the attorney general at the  time bill barr
1GS2uybciaU,5916560,5922080,explaining and he said this publicly  lester he said this to you explaining  how he very directly said to former
1GS2uybciaU,5922080,5928080,president trump no these claims are not  true i want to play a little bit of what  the former ag said and then
1GS2uybciaU,5928080,5935199,how the former president's daughter  ivanka trump  reacted to that how she was asked about  that watch
1GS2uybciaU,5937119,5942880,i repeatedly  told the president no uncertain terms
1GS2uybciaU,5942880,5948719,that  i did not see evidence of fraud
1GS2uybciaU,5948719,5953760,and you know that would have affected  the outcome of the election
1GS2uybciaU,5953760,5960480,and frankly a year and a half later i  haven't seen anything to to change my  mind on that
1GS2uybciaU,5960480,5967520,how did that affect your perspective  about the election when attorney general  barr made that statement  it affected my perspective
1GS2uybciaU,5967520,5973679,i respect attorney general barr  so i
1GS2uybciaU,5973760,5979600,accepted what he said was saying  so that's the former president's  daughter acknowledging and accepting
1GS2uybciaU,5979600,5985440,that there was no widespread election  fraud despite the the election lies  essentially that her father then sought
1GS2uybciaU,5985440,5991040,to promote it is worth noting though  that while ivanka trump said that to the  january 6 select committee it has been
1GS2uybciaU,5991040,5997199,reported that she privately uh was was  attempting to push back on some of the  claims being made she still appeared
1GS2uybciaU,5997199,6003280,with her father at a rally in georgia  two days before the insurrection lester  all right hallie thanks very much again

1GS2uybciaU,6643840,6650719,um as stated in the winter of 2020 i was  working on a documentary as part of that  documentary i filmed several rallies in
1GS2uybciaU,6650719,6656159,washington dc  on december 11th and december the 12th  and i learned there would be a rally on
1GS2uybciaU,6656159,6663199,the mall in on january 6.  so my three colleagues and i came down  to document the rally according to the
1GS2uybciaU,6663199,6668320,permit of the event there was going to  be a rally at the ellipse  we arrived at the
1GS2uybciaU,6668320,6675360,mall  and observed a large contingent of proud  boys marching towards the capital  we filmed them
1GS2uybciaU,6675360,6682639,and almost immediately i was separated  from my colleagues  i documented the crowd turned from  protesters to writers to
1GS2uybciaU,6682639,6688719,insurrectionists  i was surprised at the size of the group  the anger and the profanity
1GS2uybciaU,6688719,6694560,and for anyone who didn't understand how  violent that event  was i
1GS2uybciaU,6694560,6701920,saw it i documented it and i experienced  it  i heard incredibly aggressive chanting
1GS2uybciaU,6701920,6709040,and i shared subsequently shared that  footage with the authorities  i'm here today s  pursuant to a house subpoena thank you
1GS2uybciaU,6709040,6714800,so much  thank you mr quested  the select committee has conducted
1GS2uybciaU,6714800,6720080,extensive investigative work to  understand what led the proud boys and
1GS2uybciaU,6720080,6727440,other rioters to the capitol on january  6th  we've obtained substantial evidence
1GS2uybciaU,6727440,6735520,showing that the president's december  19th tweet  calling his followers to washington d.c
1GS2uybciaU,6735520,6742000,on january 6th  energized  individuals from the proud boys and
1GS2uybciaU,6742000,6751480,others extremist groups  i'd like to play a brief video  highlighting some of this evidence
1GS2uybciaU,6752560,6758239,my name is marcus childress and i'm an  investigative counsel for the select  committee to investigate the january 6
1GS2uybciaU,6758239,6764920,attack on the united states capitol what  do you want to call them give me your  name give me surprise
1GS2uybciaU,6766239,6772480,stand back and stand by  after he made this comment enrique  terrio then chairman of the proud boys
1GS2uybciaU,6772480,6778080,said on parlor standing by sir  during our investigation we learned that  this comment during the presidential
1GS2uybciaU,6778080,6784800,debate actually led to an increase in  membership from the proud boys would you  say that proud boys numbers increased
1GS2uybciaU,6784800,6789840,after the stand back standby comment  exponentially i'd say
1GS2uybciaU,6789840,6796080,tripled probably with the potential for  a lot more eventually and did you ever  sell any stand back and stand by
1GS2uybciaU,6796080,6803599,merchandise  uh  one of the vendors on my page actually  beat me to it but i wish i would have i
1GS2uybciaU,6803599,6810320,wish i would have made a stand back  standby shirt on december 19th president  trump tweeted about the january 6 rally
1GS2uybciaU,6810320,6816400,and told attendees be there will be wild  many of the witnesses that we  interviewed were inspired by the
1GS2uybciaU,6816400,6823520,president's call and came to d.c for  january 6. but the extremists they took  it a step further they viewed this tweet
1GS2uybciaU,6823520,6829199,as a call to arms a day later the  department of justice describes how the  proud boys created a chat called the
1GS2uybciaU,6829199,6836239,ministry of self-defense leadership chat  in this chat the proud boys established  a command structure in anticipation of
1GS2uybciaU,6836239,6841840,coming back to dc on january 6. the  department of justice describes mr  tarrio coming into possession of a
1GS2uybciaU,6841840,6848560,document called the 1776 returns which  describes  individuals occupying key buildings
1GS2uybciaU,6848560,6854159,around the united states capital the  oath keepers are another group that the  committee investigated you better get
1GS2uybciaU,6854159,6859440,your ass to d.c folks this saturday  yeah if you don't there'll be no more  republic but we're not going to let that
1GS2uybciaU,6859440,6866800,happen it's not even if  it's either president trump is  encouraged and bolstered strengthened to  do what he must do or we wind up in a
1GS2uybciaU,6866800,6872400,bloody fight we all know that the  fight's coming the oath keepers began  planning to block the peaceful transfer
1GS2uybciaU,6872400,6877599,of power shortly after november 3rd  election and according to the department  of justice stuart rhodes the oath
1GS2uybciaU,6877599,6883840,keeper's leader said to his followers  that we were not going to get through  this without the civil war in response
1GS2uybciaU,6883840,6891040,to the december 19 2020 tweet by  president trump the oath keepers focused  on january 6 in washington dc
1GS2uybciaU,6891040,6896880,in response to the tweet one member the  president of the florida chapter put on  social media the president called us to
1GS2uybciaU,6896880,6902080,the capitol he wants us to make it wild  the goal was for the oath keepers to be  called to duty so that they could keep
1GS2uybciaU,6902080,6907440,the president in power although  president trump had just lost the  election the committee learned that the
1GS2uybciaU,6907440,6914400,oath keepers set up quick reaction  forces outside of the city in virginia  where they stored arms the goal of these

1GS2uybciaU,7128960,7136719,what happened  we picked up mr tario from jail
1GS2uybciaU,7136719,7144719,he'd  been arrested for  carrying  some magazines uh some long some extra
1GS2uybciaU,7144719,7149760,capacity magazines and  for the he took responsibility for the
1GS2uybciaU,7149760,7155280,burning of the  black lives matter flag that was stolen  from the church
1GS2uybciaU,7155280,7161679,um on december the 12th  we  um we were attempting to get an
1GS2uybciaU,7161679,7169199,interview with mr tario  we had no idea of any of the events that  were going to subsequently happen
1GS2uybciaU,7169199,7176800,um  we drove him to pick up his bags from  the property department of the police
1GS2uybciaU,7176800,7183920,which is just south of the mall  we picked up his bags and went to get  some other bags from the phoenix hotel
1GS2uybciaU,7183920,7189040,where we  encountered mr stewart roads
1GS2uybciaU,7189040,7192080,from the oath keepers
1GS2uybciaU,7194159,7201280,by the time i'd gone to park the car my  colleague was saying who'd got into the  car with mr terrio that they had moved
1GS2uybciaU,7201280,7207520,to a  location around the corner the parking  garage of the
1GS2uybciaU,7207520,7213280,hall of legends i believe  and um so we quickly drove over there we
1GS2uybciaU,7213280,7219920,drove down into the parking garage  and filmed the scene of mr tario and mr
1GS2uybciaU,7219920,7228159,rhodes uh and certain other individuals  in that garage um
1GS2uybciaU,7228159,7234719,we then continued to follow mrtario  there was some discussion about where he  was going to go he ended up going
1GS2uybciaU,7234719,7240000,towards a hotel in baltimore and we  conducted an interview with him in the
1GS2uybciaU,7240000,7246400,hotel room  and then we returned to dc for that  night
1GS2uybciaU,7246400,7254560,in a  and what was interesting that night  actually was that was the first  indication that dc was much more busy
1GS2uybciaU,7254560,7260080,than it had been any other time we'd  been here because we couldn't get into  the hotels we wanted to
1GS2uybciaU,7260080,7265840,and we  um  ended up at a hotel that you know was
1GS2uybciaU,7265840,7269840,not as satisfactory as we would hoped
1GS2uybciaU,7271920,7277679,thank you so  what you're saying is you
1GS2uybciaU,7277920,7284000,filmed the meeting between mr tario and  oathkeeper's leader stewart rose right
1GS2uybciaU,7284000,7289199,indeed  you couldn't hear what was said but  according to the justice department
1GS2uybciaU,7289199,7295360,indictment of mr tario  a participant referenced the capital
1GS2uybciaU,7295360,7303040,now on the morning of january 6th you  learned the proud boys would gather near  the rallies scheduled to take place near
1GS2uybciaU,7303040,7309599,the white house  what time did you meet up with the proud  boys and what was happening when they
1GS2uybciaU,7309599,7316719,met  um we met up with the proud boys uh  somewhere around 10 30 a.m and they were
1GS2uybciaU,7316719,7324560,starting to walk  down the mile  uh  easterly direction towards the capital
1GS2uybciaU,7324560,7329760,um  there was a  a large contingent more than i had
1GS2uybciaU,7329760,7336159,expected  and i was  confused to a certain extent why we were  walking away from the president's speech
1GS2uybciaU,7336159,7341679,because that's what um  i felt we were there to cover
1GS2uybciaU,7341679,7348480,so at 10 30 a.m  uh that's early in the day that's even  before president trump had started
1GS2uybciaU,7348480,7353599,speaking am i correct yes  sir so how many proud boys would you
1GS2uybciaU,7353599,7360880,estimate were marching together  to the capitol  um a couple of hundred
1GS2uybciaU,7360880,7366960,potentially yeah i say a couple of  hundred proud boys were marching towards  the capital at that point at the time
1GS2uybciaU,7366960,7373679,was the area heavily guarded  no that was  we meant i remember we walked past the
1GS2uybciaU,7373679,7380960,we walked down the mall we walked to the  right of the reflecting pool and then  north along the road that leads to the
1GS2uybciaU,7380960,7386480,peace circle and as we were walking past  the peace circle i framed the proud boys
1GS2uybciaU,7386480,7392400,to the right of my shot with the capital  behind and we see one sole police
1GS2uybciaU,7392400,7397599,officer  um at the barriers which are  subsequently breached
1GS2uybciaU,7397599,7403599,we then walk up and passed a  um tactical unit preparing
1GS2uybciaU,7403599,7410719,and there's you see that in the film  where the man questions their duty and  their honor and you see
1GS2uybciaU,7410719,7417840,maybe a dozen  um  uh capitol police um putting on their  riot gear
1GS2uybciaU,7417840,7423119,so  how would you describe the atmosphere at  that
1GS2uybciaU,7423119,7431360,that time  the atmosphere was it seemed to be much  darker i i make efforts to create
1GS2uybciaU,7431360,7436880,a familiarity between myself and my  subjects to you know make them feel  comfortable
1GS2uybciaU,7436880,7443760,and um  the the atmosphere was much darker than  at this day than than had been in these
1GS2uybciaU,7443760,7449119,other in these other in these other days  and there was also a contingent of proud
1GS2uybciaU,7449119,7456000,boys that i hadn't met before from  arizona who appeared to wear these  orange hats
1GS2uybciaU,7456400,7462000,and had orange armbands  so when the proud boys went back down
1GS2uybciaU,7462000,7467119,the hill to the peace circle did a  larger crowd start together
1GS2uybciaU,7467119,7473280,well no first of all we went round to  the back and down the steps and we took  some photographs on the east side of the
1GS2uybciaU,7473280,7479560,capitol  and then we went for lunch we went for  tuckers
1GS2uybciaU,7479760,7485119,so mr question you're a journalist  so you are careful to stick to things
1GS2uybciaU,7485119,7490400,that you have observed  but what you've told us
1GS2uybciaU,7490400,7495440,is highly relevant  let me highlight a few key facts that
1GS2uybciaU,7495440,7500960,you and others have provided the  committee  first there was a large group of proud
1GS2uybciaU,7500960,7506400,boys present at the capitol  we know that from multiple sources
1GS2uybciaU,7506400,7513679,you now estimate that there were around  250  uh to 300 individuals that you've
1GS2uybciaU,7513679,7521440,testified  they weren't there for president trump's  speech  we know this because they left that area
1GS2uybciaU,7521440,7527280,to march toward the capitol before the  speech began  they walked around the capitol that
1GS2uybciaU,7527280,7534079,morning  i'm concerned this allowed them to see  what defenses were in place and where
1GS2uybciaU,7534079,7539599,weaknesses might be  and they decided to launch their attack
1GS2uybciaU,7539599,7545920,at the peace peace circle  which is a front door of the capitol  complex
1GS2uybciaU,7545920,7551920,it's the first security perimeter  that those marching from the ellipse
1GS2uybciaU,7551920,7558960,would have to come to  as they moved toward the capitol  the peace circle walk away
1GS2uybciaU,7558960,7566079,was  walkway  was always where the thousands of angry  trump supporters would arrive after
1GS2uybciaU,7566079,7571520,president trump  sent them  from the lips
1GS2uybciaU,7571520,7577599,the proud boys timed their attack to the  moments before the start of the joint  session
1GS2uybciaU,7577599,7583679,in the capitol which is also where  president trump directed the angry ma
1GS2uybciaU,7583679,7590400,quote we fight like hell end quote he  told them before sending them
1GS2uybciaU,7590400,7595840,down pennsylvania avenue right to where  the proud boys gathered and where you
1GS2uybciaU,7595840,7602719,were filming  now central question is whether the  attack on the capitol was coordinated
1GS2uybciaU,7602719,7609360,and planned  what you witnessed is what a coordinated  and planned effort would look like
1GS2uybciaU,7609360,7614719,it was the culmination of  a months-long effort spearheaded by
1GS2uybciaU,7614719,7621040,president trump  mr question thank you for your  eyewitness account
1GS2uybciaU,7621040,7627280,of the lead up to the breach of the  priest circle  this brings us to a point in time where
1GS2uybciaU,7627280,7632320,you  and officer edwards were in close  proximity
1GS2uybciaU,7632320,7638400,at this point  i reserved a balance of my time pursuant  to 5c

1GS2uybciaU,7678639,7683920,short clip  that  shows  the horrible moment when you were

1GS2uybciaU,7741440,7750320,walkway or right by peace circle there  was another bike rack and so  the crowd had kind of gathered there
1GS2uybciaU,7750320,7755440,it was the crowd led by  joseph biggs
1GS2uybciaU,7755440,7762480,and they were mostly in civilian clothes  there were some  who had military fatigues
1GS2uybciaU,7762480,7768960,on  we could see  people with  bulletproof vests on you know things
1GS2uybciaU,7768960,7775040,like that  they didn't seem you know  extremely cohesive but they had gathered
1GS2uybciaU,7775040,7781840,there in their outfits  but they had gathered there  together and
1GS2uybciaU,7781840,7786960,joseph biggs started  he had a micro or a megaphone and he
1GS2uybciaU,7786960,7793280,started talking about  you know first it was  things kind of
1GS2uybciaU,7793280,7799599,relating to congress  and then  the
1GS2uybciaU,7799599,7805920,table started turning  once  the  what is now that the arizona group is
1GS2uybciaU,7805920,7811360,what you said  the crowd with orange hats  they came up chanting

1GS2uybciaU,7830480,7836000,he started asking us questions like  you've you didn't miss a paycheck during
1GS2uybciaU,7836000,7843840,the pandemic  um mentioning stuff about our pay scale  was mentioned
1GS2uybciaU,7844079,7849119,and  you know started turning the tables on  us
1GS2uybciaU,7849119,7854639,and  i've worked  i can
1GS2uybciaU,7854639,7861840,you know conservatively say probably  hundreds  of  civil disturbance events i know when i'm
1GS2uybciaU,7861840,7867360,being turned into a villain and that's  when i turned to my sergeant and i
1GS2uybciaU,7867360,7873599,stated the  understatement of the century i said  sarge  i think we're going to need a few more
1GS2uybciaU,7873599,7880560,people down here  and  so after that
1GS2uybciaU,7880560,7885840,you know  i think they started conferring they  went a little silent they started
1GS2uybciaU,7885840,7891520,conferring among  each other  i saw
1GS2uybciaU,7891920,7899280,the person now identified as ryan samsel  he put his arm  around joseph begs and they were talking
1GS2uybciaU,7899280,7905520,and then they started approaching the  first barricade they ripped the first  barricade down
1GS2uybciaU,7905520,7911360,and they approached  our  bike racks
1GS2uybciaU,7911360,7917040,um  you know at that time  [Music]  we
1GS2uybciaU,7917040,7922079,started  holding on grabbing the bike racks
1GS2uybciaU,7922079,7927599,you know there weren't many of us so i  grabbed  the middle between two different bike
1GS2uybciaU,7927599,7934159,racks  and  you know i wasn't under any pretense  that i could hold it for very long but i
1GS2uybciaU,7934159,7942159,just wanted to you know make sure that  we could get more people down and  get our cdu units time to to answer the
1GS2uybciaU,7942159,7947840,call so  we started grappling over the bike racks
1GS2uybciaU,7947840,7954480,i felt  the bike rack  come on top of my head
1GS2uybciaU,7954480,7960639,and i was pushed backwards  and my foot caught the stair behind me
1GS2uybciaU,7960639,7968719,and i  my chin hit the handrail and then i at  that point i had blacked out but my
1GS2uybciaU,7968719,7974800,the back of my head clipped  the concrete stairs behind me
1GS2uybciaU,7974960,7980079,and you were knocked unconscious is that  right officer edwards yes ma'am
1GS2uybciaU,7980079,7985599,but then when you regained consciousness  even with the injuries you returned to  duty is that right
1GS2uybciaU,7985599,7993280,yes ma'am um  you know at that time adrenaline kicked  in  i ran towards the west front and i tried
1GS2uybciaU,7993280,7998320,to hold the line at the senate steps
1GS2uybciaU,7998320,8005599,at the lower west terrace  more people kept coming
1GS2uybciaU,8005599,8012719,at us  it just seemed like  you know more and more people started
1GS2uybciaU,8012719,8018079,you know coming on to the west front  they started overpowering us
1GS2uybciaU,8018079,8023440,and that was right about when  mpd's officers showed up
1GS2uybciaU,8023440,8030239,their bike officers  pushed the crowd back  and allowed
1GS2uybciaU,8030239,8035599,our cdu units as well as theirs to form  that line that you see
1GS2uybciaU,8035599,8042560,that very thin line between us  and the protesters or the writers
1GS2uybciaU,8042560,8048400,you know at that time i fell behind that  line  and
1GS2uybciaU,8048400,8055440,for a while i started um decontaminating  people who had gotten
1GS2uybciaU,8055440,8062000,sprayed  and  treating people medically
1GS2uybciaU,8062000,8068000,who who needed it  and then you were injured again uh there

1GS2uybciaU,8090000,8096880,and officer siknik  was  behind me  for most of the time for about
1GS2uybciaU,8096880,8102239,30 to 45 minutes that i was down there  um
1GS2uybciaU,8102239,8107520,we were just  as the best we could we were just you  know grappling over
1GS2uybciaU,8107520,8113360,bike racks and trying to hold them as  quick as possible
1GS2uybciaU,8115440,8120639,all of the sudden i see  movement
1GS2uybciaU,8120639,8125920,to the left of me  and i turned and it was officer sicknick
1GS2uybciaU,8125920,8132480,with his head and his hands  and he was ghostly pale
1GS2uybciaU,8132480,8139679,which i i figured at that point that he  had been sprayed  and i was
1GS2uybciaU,8139679,8146400,concerned my  you know cop  cop alarm bells went off
1GS2uybciaU,8146400,8153040,because if you get sprayed with  pepper spray  you're going to turn red
1GS2uybciaU,8153040,8160400,he turned  just about as pale as the sheet of paper  and so i looked back to see what had hit
1GS2uybciaU,8160400,8167040,him what had happened  and that's when i got sprayed in the  eyes as well
1GS2uybciaU,8167040,8172159,i was taken to be decontaminated by  another officer
1GS2uybciaU,8172159,8178719,but we didn't get the chance because we  were then tear gassed
1GS2uybciaU,8178719,8185199,and we  are going to play just a brief clip of  of that moment that you've just
1GS2uybciaU,8185199,8189159,described officer edwards
1GS2uybciaU,8192080,8200599,oh  [Applause]

1GS2uybciaU,8220160,8226800,and  one of the things one of the  capitol police officers said to me
1GS2uybciaU,8226800,8233678,recently was  to ask me whether or not as members of  congress all of us understood that
1GS2uybciaU,8233678,8241359,on that day on january 6 when we were  evacuated from the chamber  we're led to a safe undisclosed location
1GS2uybciaU,8241359,8247120,whether we knew that that so many of you  had rushed out of the building and into  the fight and
1GS2uybciaU,8247120,8253518,i can assure you that we do know that  and that we understand how important  your service is

1GS2uybciaU,8283518,8287678,out most vividly in your mind
1GS2uybciaU,8288960,8294638,i can um  that time
1GS2uybciaU,8294638,8301040,when i talked about falling behind  mpd's  line
1GS2uybciaU,8302000,8307040,i remember because i had been  kind of shielded away
1GS2uybciaU,8307040,8314000,because i was holding those stairs  so i wasn't able to really see what was  going on over here
1GS2uybciaU,8314000,8319598,when i fell behind that line  and
1GS2uybciaU,8319598,8326880,i saw  i can just remember  my my breath
1GS2uybciaU,8326880,8334800,catching in my throat  because i what i saw was just a war
1GS2uybciaU,8334800,8340160,scene  it was something like i'd seen out of  the movies
1GS2uybciaU,8340160,8347518,i i couldn't believe my eyes there were  officers on the ground um
1GS2uybciaU,8347518,8353920,you know  they were bleeding they were throwing up  they were you know they had
1GS2uybciaU,8353920,8359040,i mean i saw friends with blood all over  their faces i was slipping in people's
1GS2uybciaU,8359040,8364800,blood um  you know i i was
1GS2uybciaU,8364800,8372398,catching people as they fell  you know i was  it was
1GS2uybciaU,8372558,8380000,carnage  it was chaos  i i can't i can't even
1GS2uybciaU,8380000,8385678,describe  what i saw i never in my wildest dreams
1GS2uybciaU,8385678,8391840,did i think that as  a police officer as a law enforcement  officer i would find myself
1GS2uybciaU,8391840,8397439,in the middle of a battle  you know  i'm trained to
1GS2uybciaU,8397439,8404000,detain  you know a couple of subjects and and  handle you know handle a crowd but i'm
1GS2uybciaU,8404000,8409920,not combat trained  and  that day it was just
1GS2uybciaU,8409920,8415280,hours  of hand-to-hand combat hours of dealing
1GS2uybciaU,8415280,8421280,with things  that were  way beyond any any a law enforcement
1GS2uybciaU,8421280,8428800,officer has ever trained for  and i just remember i just remember that  moment of stepping behind the line and
1GS2uybciaU,8428800,8435520,just seeing  the absolute war zone that the west  front had become
1GS2uybciaU,8439840,8445280,let me thank you  for your service and obviously your  bravery
1GS2uybciaU,8445280,8450479,that you  have told the world about tonight
1GS2uybciaU,8450479,8455279,it's unfortunate that you had to defend  the capital
1GS2uybciaU,8455600,8460960,from fellow americans none of us  would ever
1GS2uybciaU,8460960,8466080,think that that would have to happen but  it did  so let me thank our witnesses for
1GS2uybciaU,8466080,8472399,joining us tonight and sharing their  experiences with america  throughout my chairmanship of this
1GS2uybciaU,8472399,8479040,committee i've continuously vowed that  this committee will ensure a  comprehensive account
1GS2uybciaU,8479040,8484560,of the heroic acts on january 6th  and that we will follow the facts
1GS2uybciaU,8484560,8493120,wherever they lead your testimony is an  essential part  of that record and helps us do our job
1GS2uybciaU,8493120,8500640,mr quested  thank you for sharing your footage and  your account of the day's events with us
1GS2uybciaU,8500640,8507600,the images you recorded  and have shared with  the committee do a better job than any
1GS2uybciaU,8507600,8513200,of our words in reinforcing  the violence of january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,8513200,8518399,we hope that the power of your footage  helped encourage all americans to
1GS2uybciaU,8518399,8526080,consider how citizens with such so much  in common could viciously brawl at the
1GS2uybciaU,8526080,8531600,seat of their democratic government  officer edwards
1GS2uybciaU,8531600,8538960,thank you for your brave service as i  indicated on january 6th  and all you did to protect us
1GS2uybciaU,8538960,8544880,and most importantly our democracy  if you and your fellow officers hadn't
1GS2uybciaU,8544880,8552560,held the line against those violent  insurrectionists  we can only imagine the disaster that
1GS2uybciaU,8552560,8557840,would have ensued  your heroism is the face of danger
1GS2uybciaU,8557840,8565840,that's admirable  and your will to continue to protect and  serve despite your serious injuries
1GS2uybciaU,8565840,8572880,should be an inspiration to all of us  we wish you  a continued recovery
1GS2uybciaU,8572880,8578880,and look forward to seeing you back  in uniform sometime soon
1GS2uybciaU,8578880,8584479,the members of the select committee may  have additional questions for tonight's  witnesses
1GS2uybciaU,8584479,8590319,and we ask that you respond  expeditiously in writing to those  questions
1GS2uybciaU,8590319,8595840,without objections members we permitted  10 business days to submit statements
1GS2uybciaU,8595840,8602080,for the record  including opening remarks and additional  questions for the witnesses
1GS2uybciaU,8602080,8610160,the witnesses have just told us  what they heard the rioters saying  why they stormed the capitol on that day
1GS2uybciaU,8610160,8616399,now we're going to hear it from the  rioters themselves  without objection i include
1GS2uybciaU,8616399,8621319,in the record a video presentation
1GS2uybciaU,8625520,8630800,[Applause]  what really made me want to come was the  fact that
1GS2uybciaU,8630800,8636640,you know i had supported trump all that  time  i did believe you know that the election
1GS2uybciaU,8636640,8641840,was being stolen  and trump asked us to come he personally
1GS2uybciaU,8641840,8648160,asked for us to come to d.c that day  and i thought  for everything he's done for us
1GS2uybciaU,8648160,8653200,if this is the only thing he's going to  ask of me  i'll do it we're going to walk down to
1GS2uybciaU,8653200,8658880,the capitol  did you call president trump mentioning  going to the capitol during his speech
1GS2uybciaU,8658880,8665760,oh yeah so that's one of my  disappointments he said he was going to  go and go with us that he was going to  be there i know why i was there and
1GS2uybciaU,8665760,8671359,that's because he called me there and he  laid out
1GS2uybciaU,8671359,8678479,what is happening in our government  he laid it out but i remember donald  trump telling people to be there right i
1GS2uybciaU,8678479,8685600,mean to support so you mentioned pres  that the president asked you uh do you  remember a specific message
1GS2uybciaU,8685600,8691680,basically yeah yes uh for us to come to  d.c i think things are gonna happen what
1GS2uybciaU,8691680,8698399,got me interested he said i have  something very uh important to say on  january 6 or something like that
1GS2uybciaU,8698399,8705359,as what what what what got me interested  to be there you know trump has only  asked me for two things he asked me for
1GS2uybciaU,8705359,8711398,my vote and he asked me to come on  january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,8713359,8718560,when the committee reconvenes next week  we're going to examine the lies that
1GS2uybciaU,8718560,8725920,convince those men and others to storm  the capital  to try to stop the transfer of power
1GS2uybciaU,8725920,8730960,we're going to take a close look  at the first part of trump's attack
1GS2uybciaU,8730960,8736640,on the rule of law  when he hit the fuse that ultimately  resulted
1GS2uybciaU,8736640,8742479,in the violence of january 6th  without objection and with
1GS2uybciaU,8742479,8746960,with that the committee stands are  joined
1GS2uybciaU,8750240,8755600,so two live witnesses at this uh first  of uh seven uh
1GS2uybciaU,8755600,8762319,extraordinary kind of hearings that  we'll be seeing uh in this month  uh we heard from a former or a member
1GS2uybciaU,8762319,8768319,actually the  capitol police department described what  she called carnage and chaos we also
1GS2uybciaU,8768319,8774640,heard in the second part of tonight's  presentation from a documentary  filmmaker who had some access to the
1GS2uybciaU,8774640,8779920,proud boys  all this color though that leads to the  central theme of what this committee
1GS2uybciaU,8779920,8786880,seems to be trying to point out and  prove is that donald trump was part of a  seven point plan to overturn the results
1GS2uybciaU,8786880,8792319,of the election and prevent a transfer  of power i want to go inside now inside
1GS2uybciaU,8792319,8798640,that hearing room nbc news senior  capitol hill correspondent garrett hake  is actually outside the room what can
1GS2uybciaU,8798640,8803840,you tell us about what's happening  lester i have no idea how this will play
1GS2uybciaU,8803840,8810960,in the rest of the country but in that  hearing room the video that was shown  and the testimony of officer edwards hit
1GS2uybciaU,8810960,8817520,like a sledgehammer you have to remember  this is a community of hundreds back  thousands of people on capitol hill who
1GS2uybciaU,8817520,8824560,lived through january 6 together many  people including lawmakers who were in  the gallery on that day are here in the
1GS2uybciaU,8824560,8831840,hearing room watching and listening  after the video was played they were  coming out in tears too emotional to
1GS2uybciaU,8831840,8837520,speak hugging each other you're even  seeing some of it now with officer  edwards and the other police officers
1GS2uybciaU,8837520,8843920,who sat behind her for her remarks many  of whom have testified themselves  forming kind of this fraternity of
1GS2uybciaU,8843920,8849200,people who have been through this  and so the video had incredible
1GS2uybciaU,8849200,8855439,emotional residence in the room so too  the testimony  of officer edwards i think that's the
1GS2uybciaU,8855439,8860960,kind of thing the committee was was  hoping would also speak to the american  people but for the community on capitol
1GS2uybciaU,8860960,8866000,hill  that's what we went through and that's  what the committee wants the rest of the
1GS2uybciaU,8866000,8872319,country to understand about that day  yeah garrett thank you nbc news  political director and moderator of meet
1GS2uybciaU,8872319,8878080,the press chuck todd is here chuck many  will look at this  who understand the gravity of what
1GS2uybciaU,8878080,8883600,happened in that day but wonder what is  the point  look it's important to have a complete
1GS2uybciaU,8883600,8889760,record i think for for for the history  books number one um but this is
1GS2uybciaU,8889760,8897040,this is the investigation we didn't get  to have in the second impeachment you  know it was rushed for
1GS2uybciaU,8897040,8902800,for reasons that were at the time  i think it you know we could we could  have a debate about you know whether
1GS2uybciaU,8902800,8908880,they should have immediately begun the  impeachment proceedings before january  20th or if they were going to wait then
1GS2uybciaU,8908880,8914880,give it a few months and do a more  complete investigation because i keep  coming back to this lester this is the
1GS2uybciaU,8914880,8920080,single most  this is we've had the mueller report  we've had two impeachments and you have
1GS2uybciaU,8920080,8925439,this four very compelling investigations  into wrongdoing by president trump
1GS2uybciaU,8925439,8930800,this one truly has the receipts  this connects the dots and i tell you
1GS2uybciaU,8930800,8938640,this  it there's basically i think they've  laid out two separate conspiracies  conspiracy one was the one in the lead
1GS2uybciaU,8938640,8944720,up all of the attempts to overturn the  election and then conspiracy two  that i think was laid out pretty
1GS2uybciaU,8944720,8951600,compellingly was the oath keepers and  the proud boys  doing what they were doing here to  essentially take matters into their own
1GS2uybciaU,8951600,8957920,hands if necessary if plan a didn't work  here  i've been waiting to see how much they
1GS2uybciaU,8957920,8964720,can connect the president to that second  part to the attack on the capitol and we  got a very compelling piece of video
1GS2uybciaU,8964720,8970560,there at the end almost like a trailer  about where they're going which is every  one of these folks who have pled guilty
1GS2uybciaU,8970560,8976800,who have been who have been forced to  testify  they all seem to be saying the same  thing i was there because donald trump
1GS2uybciaU,8976800,8982640,asked me to  it was quite compelling  chuck thank you kristin walker is nbc's
1GS2uybciaU,8982640,8988080,chief white house correspondent chris  and let's talk about the reaction from  republicans so far in many ways this
1GS2uybciaU,8988080,8993600,hearing was pre-budded  that's absolutely right lester we're  getting a range of reaction from
1GS2uybciaU,8993600,8998640,republicans who are some dismissing the  hearing outright others trying to
1GS2uybciaU,8998640,9004560,refocus the attention on the economy let  me read you a few jim jordan the  congressman saying where's the prime
1GS2uybciaU,9004560,9009920,time hearing on president biden's  botched afghanistan withdrawal  representative elise stefanik saying
1GS2uybciaU,9009920,9016160,nancy pelosi's select committee is a  political witch hunt we heard from  former president trump before this
1GS2uybciaU,9016160,9021520,hearing got underway he wrote this is a  political hoax to counter inflation and
1GS2uybciaU,9021520,9028000,then senator bill hagerty said for the  first time in history every single state  has hit its highest gas prices ever
1GS2uybciaU,9028000,9034319,recorded that may be the most  significant reaction lester because it  underscores the strategy that we can
1GS2uybciaU,9034319,9040560,expect to see from republicans heading  into the midterms really trying to turn  the page from these hearings and refocus
1GS2uybciaU,9040560,9045600,it on to the top issue for americans  soaring inflation record high gas prices
1GS2uybciaU,9045600,9052880,for his part we haven't heard a reaction  yet from president biden he is traveling  in california a diplomatic summit there
1GS2uybciaU,9052880,9058960,but we are told that he will be watching  bits and pieces of this hearing  throughout the evening i've been talking
1GS2uybciaU,9058960,9064880,to democrats who are close to the white  house who have signaled they are not  going to shy away from trying to link
1GS2uybciaU,9064880,9070399,trump-backed candidates to january 6 to  the horror that unfolded on that day
1GS2uybciaU,9070399,9077040,with the midterms looming large the  question is will these hearings have an  impact on the all-important midterm
1GS2uybciaU,9077040,9083359,elections it is not clear it could have  an impact around the edges some of those  very close races lester but look we are
1GS2uybciaU,9083359,9088399,looking at new video new testimony and  that certainly is significant lester
1GS2uybciaU,9088399,9093439,yeah kristen thank you in both law and  politics as you know are at play in  these hearings so i want to bring in our
1GS2uybciaU,9093439,9100399,nbc news analysts to help provide  clarity on the issues at stake chuck  rosenberg is a former u.s attorney and
1GS2uybciaU,9100399,9105600,senior fbi official yamiche alcindor is  our nbc news washington correspondent
1GS2uybciaU,9105600,9114080,good to have you both here chuck first  we noted at the top of this this is not  a  criminal proceeding it's not even uh uh
1GS2uybciaU,9114080,9120880,action against a president uh so let me  ask you here what what legal bar is  there what's being watched right now uh
1GS2uybciaU,9120880,9127359,at the justice department as they  consider whether  charges could emanate from this  well you're exactly right lester it's
1GS2uybciaU,9127359,9133040,not a criminal proceeding it's not  really even a legal proceeding there are  no rules of evidence there are no rules
1GS2uybciaU,9133040,9139920,of procedure at least ones that i'm  familiar with as a prosecutor there's no  judge there's no cross-examination
1GS2uybciaU,9139920,9146080,are justice department officials  watching this of course they are it's  important to us as americans but it's
1GS2uybciaU,9146080,9151520,also important to them as folks who may  bring additional charges against  additional people
1GS2uybciaU,9151520,9157920,all that said  this is a big complex sprawling  multifaceted story there are parts of it
1GS2uybciaU,9157920,9163439,that we heard today that are just like  what you would hear in court  congresswoman cheney's opening statement
1GS2uybciaU,9163439,9169280,for instance in which she told the jury  in this case the audience what they  would what they will hear what they
1GS2uybciaU,9169280,9175520,should expect to hear  over the coming several weeks of  hearings  there are also parts of this story that
1GS2uybciaU,9175520,9182560,we heard today that are incredibly  compelling and emotional but not  necessarily probative of the central
1GS2uybciaU,9182560,9190080,questions at least central to my mind  which is for instance did president  trump knowingly and intentionally engage
1GS2uybciaU,9190080,9197680,in a plot lead a plot direct the plot uh  to uh impede the congress and to  overturn the electoral vote so
1GS2uybciaU,9197680,9203760,as a prosecutor i have one reaction as  an american quite another  they're not they're not exactly on
1GS2uybciaU,9203760,9210000,parallel tracks but it is a very complex  multifaceted story  and if congresswoman cheney and the
1GS2uybciaU,9210000,9215840,committee deliver what she promised to  deliver i think it'll be compelling  watching
1GS2uybciaU,9215840,9222080,all right now yamiche then there is  politics uh republicans will hear some  of the reaction calling this a political
1GS2uybciaU,9222080,9229520,witch hunt can it be two things can it  be of political use for democrats but  also be very true
1GS2uybciaU,9229520,9234880,it can be uh lester and i've been  talking to a number of people  while they were watching this
1GS2uybciaU,9234880,9241520,republicans and democrats and i should  tell you here are the words that are  coming up for the people i'm speaking  with they're talking about this being
1GS2uybciaU,9241520,9246960,riveting being compelling being stomach  churning i also talked to a former aide
1GS2uybciaU,9246960,9253280,to former president trump who was  involved in making the case that the  2020 election was stolen he was even
1GS2uybciaU,9253280,9259520,traveling to different states and was  part of the legal team that was trying  to convince voters and local officials
1GS2uybciaU,9259520,9266720,to try to overturn the election he told  me that tonight these videos this  testimony these witnesses that they make
1GS2uybciaU,9266720,9272880,former president trump look quote  extremely culpable and he said if  anybody believes that the 2020 election
1GS2uybciaU,9272880,9278240,was rigged after watching this that  they're chasing what he called a fool's  dream of course there is politics in
1GS2uybciaU,9278240,9284800,this we know that there are some  republicans who were already preempting  calling this a witch hunt and and really  trying to make sure that that they
1GS2uybciaU,9284800,9290479,really try to focus the attention of the  republican base and republican voters  away from this hearing but what you saw
1GS2uybciaU,9290479,9296319,of course was that compelling video from  people inside former president trump's  inner circle his daughter the attorney
1GS2uybciaU,9296319,9302160,general and also i'm very interested in  the fact that there was jason miller a  very close a talking about the fact that
1GS2uybciaU,9302160,9307520,former president trump's data person  told him he was going to lose the  election months before he actually lost
1GS2uybciaU,9307520,9313840,it so in this regard i'm really hearing  from people saying that this was a  powerful opening statement i should also
1GS2uybciaU,9313840,9319760,say that someone told me an ethics  lawyer said it was very important for  liz cheney only one of two republicans
1GS2uybciaU,9319760,9326240,on this committee to be part of the of  the person part of the person who was  really talking about the the role that
1GS2uybciaU,9326240,9331520,they see former president trump as  playing saying that he was the center of  the conspiracy of the sprawling
1GS2uybciaU,9331520,9337520,conspiracy to overturn the election they  said that person um it's really  important that liz cheney was one
1GS2uybciaU,9337520,9342800,delivering that message because that in  some ways takes the edge off calling  it's a partisan attack of course we have
1GS2uybciaU,9342800,9348080,heard a lot of republicans including  kevin mccarthy saying that this is  partisan committee but those are some of
1GS2uybciaU,9348080,9353760,the reactions that i'm hearing um the  big question of course will be what  impact will this have will voters who
1GS2uybciaU,9353760,9360160,are dealing with so many other issues  like inflation like the shortage of baby  former like crime and covid will they
1GS2uybciaU,9360160,9365920,pay attention and that question is yet  to be answered  yeah you point out uh some of those who
1GS2uybciaU,9365920,9371120,were center to this first hearing and  those clips were people close
1GS2uybciaU,9371120,9377840,to the former president people who  presumably would not want to do him harm  but testifying and we saw clips of that
1GS2uybciaU,9377840,9383840,senior washington correspondent hallie  jackson also with us what can we expect  in the days ahead this is hearing number
1GS2uybciaU,9383840,9390319,one how will this all play out this is  only the beginning and you heard  congressman liz cheney lay out what to  expect in the next set of hearings the
1GS2uybciaU,9390319,9396479,next one hearing number two will focus  on people close to former president  trump who knew that they were not
1GS2uybciaU,9396479,9402880,telling the truth essentially the  committee's going to try to make the  claim they knew they were lying when  they made these claims of election fraud
1GS2uybciaU,9402880,9409680,that's going to be the focus of the next  hearing after that the third hearing  will be on the fallout at the department  of justice throughout this process the
1GS2uybciaU,9409680,9416720,fourth will be on the pressure campaign  on then vice president mike pence to  throw a wrench into the plans on january
1GS2uybciaU,9416720,9421920,6 which of course uh  pence resisted and i don't want this  moment to go by lester there was another
1GS2uybciaU,9421920,9428640,startling moment a piece of new  information we learned tonight when  congresswoman cheney quoted somebody  saying that at the time at the day of
1GS2uybciaU,9428640,9434240,the insurrection as those riders were  chanting hang my pens  former president trump at the time
1GS2uybciaU,9434240,9440720,turned to somebody in the room and said  something along the lines of pence  deserves it that was  an extraordinary moment last week we're
1GS2uybciaU,9440720,9446080,going to be hearing more about that in  the weeks to come the fifth hearing will  focus on the fake electors scheme that
1GS2uybciaU,9446080,9453120,was put in place to try to subvert the  legitimate results of the election and  then the last two those will be the  connecting of the dots specifically in
1GS2uybciaU,9453120,9459280,the moments leading up to and on january  6. so more of that compelling video that  testimony that we've seen as we're
1GS2uybciaU,9459280,9465040,looking at this live shot lester i just  want to quickly mention we've seen some  people hear the people in the room and  we've heard some of them mentioned
1GS2uybciaU,9465040,9470720,officers who were at the capitol that  day there's a woman a blonde woman in a  blue dress who we just saw erin smith i
1GS2uybciaU,9470720,9475920,spoke with her today she is  the wife of officer jeff smith of the
1GS2uybciaU,9475920,9482720,metro d.c police who died in the line of  duty his death ruled a line of duty  death after he died by suicide nine days
1GS2uybciaU,9482720,9489920,after the insurrection and  mrs smith told me first of all she's in  talks potentially to come forward and be
1GS2uybciaU,9489920,9495200,one of the witnesses the live witnesses  in one of these hearings and she said  she wants to do that she wants people to
1GS2uybciaU,9495200,9500640,know that there were officers who went  to the capitol that day to defend  democracy she does not want their
1GS2uybciaU,9500640,9506399,stories to be forgotten i think that  also speaks to what we heard from  officer edwards here tonight lester and  what has been
1GS2uybciaU,9506399,9512640,a notable two plus hours now from the  select committee  yeah and this uh select committee uh
1GS2uybciaU,9512640,9518240,putting a pretty high bar saying they'll  play out this seven part plan to  overturn the election with donald trump
1GS2uybciaU,9518240,9524080,they hold at its head that concludes our  special prime time coverage of the  january 6 hearings there will be much

1GS2uybciaU,13440,19439,will take place members of the house  select committee preparing to take their  seats at the front of the room the seven

1GS2uybciaU,24480,31279,expected to speak tonight capitol police  officer carolyn edwards you see part of  her body there who suffered traumatic
1GS2uybciaU,31279,37280,brain injuries on that now infamous day  edward's seen on video after confronting  some of the first rioters who attempted
1GS2uybciaU,37280,42320,to charge the capitol building the other  high profile witness documentarian nick
1GS2uybciaU,42320,48879,quested the british filmmaker following  the far-right militia group the proud  boys as the riot unfolded much of the
1GS2uybciaU,48879,54399,footage he shot expected to be made  public for the first time tonight and  tonight's hearing the first of six
1GS2uybciaU,54399,60239,sessions planned throughout june and as  we wait for the committee to begin  making their case we cannot forget why
1GS2uybciaU,60239,66320,we are here these are just some of the  images from the january 6 committee that  they want the country to never forget
1GS2uybciaU,66320,72640,rioters violently storming the nation's  capital attempting to interrupt the  certification of a democratic election
1GS2uybciaU,72640,79360,some of them even making it onto the  senate floor breaching the very building  where tonight's hearing will take place
1GS2uybciaU,79360,84560,the department of justice has already  arrested more than 800 people in  connection with the january 6 riots many
1GS2uybciaU,84560,90240,of them seen in those images but the  committee tonight is aiming to paint an  even more comprehensive picture and to
1GS2uybciaU,90240,96000,ensure everyone involved from the top to  bottom is held accountable nbc news  senior capitol hill correspondent joins
1GS2uybciaU,96000,101200,us now garrett haike has covered the  events of january 6 since the beginning  and he's in the hallway right outside
1GS2uybciaU,101200,107920,where the prime time hearing will be  broadcast to us live garrett explain to  our viewers what they're going to be  watching from the room behind you in
1GS2uybciaU,107920,114640,just about half an hour is this going to  look like a trial or more like a  powerpoint presentation
1GS2uybciaU,114640,119840,well tom it's not going to look anything  like a typical congressional hearing the  room behind me has been made over that's
1GS2uybciaU,119840,126320,not even normally a hearing room in fact  it's one of the largest rooms available  in the capitol you saw that enormous
1GS2uybciaU,126320,132239,screen that they are using to broadcast  the videos that will be a central  portion of what we see tonight both the
1GS2uybciaU,132239,138480,new video you talked about from the  documentary filmmaker as well as videos  of interviews conducted by the committee
1GS2uybciaU,138480,144480,that portion may in fact look like a  trial you will see deposition videos of  people like ivanka trump and jared
1GS2uybciaU,144480,150959,kushner who the american people will be  hearing from about this attack really  for the very first time and unlike in a
1GS2uybciaU,150959,156560,traditional hearing you won't have those  five-minute back and forth you won't  have a counter narrative being presented
1GS2uybciaU,156560,162560,by another party here this is a  production by the january 6 committee  over this two hour time frame to tell a
1GS2uybciaU,162560,168000,very specific story there'll be six more  chapters but tonight is the opening  argument if we want to stick with the
1GS2uybciaU,168000,173680,trial metaphor speaking of telling a  story i do want to ask you about the  presentation the video itself the
1GS2uybciaU,173680,179360,committee tapped a former top broadcast  executive james goldston a former  president of abc news and in full
1GS2uybciaU,179360,185280,disclosure my former boss to advise in  the production of tonight's prime time  hearing he's somebody who's worked on
1GS2uybciaU,185280,191840,documentaries including uh my life with  michael jackson which was an incredible  documentary he's produced election
1GS2uybciaU,191840,198400,specials debate specials he knows what  he's doing why do you think the  democrats needed to bring in a heavy  hitter when it comes to the production
1GS2uybciaU,198400,204640,of this prime time hearing to the  american public  tom the committee wants to grab people
1GS2uybciaU,204640,210959,who aren't tuning in looking for news  they want the viewers who may be turned  on the tv tonight looking for csi or the
1GS2uybciaU,210959,216560,masked singer okay they need the people  who have not been following this  investigation every step of the way to
1GS2uybciaU,216560,222640,see the story they are trying to tell  and to stay in their seats and watch it  and for that the committee wanted
1GS2uybciaU,222640,228640,professional assistance here to make  sure they weren't just giving people  another washington story about what
1GS2uybciaU,228640,234000,happened on january 6th but they were  providing a compelling message about  what they say was a threat that started
1GS2uybciaU,234000,240879,the moment donald trump lost the  election and continues not just to the  sixth but they will argue all the way up
1GS2uybciaU,240879,247200,until this very moment and into future  elections for that they needed to tell a  story not just hold a traditional
1GS2uybciaU,247200,254640,hearing all right garrett hey stand by  for us we will be coming back to you we  thank you for your reporting tonight's  hearing held nearly 520 days after
1GS2uybciaU,254640,261120,january 6 but the committee is hoping to  make sure the country never forgets that  day and that the people responsible are
1GS2uybciaU,261120,267360,held accountable so how do we get here  nbc news anchor hallie jackson has a  look back
1GS2uybciaU,267360,274160,it's a day that nearly brought america  to its knees  an attack on the capitol after former
1GS2uybciaU,274160,282840,president trump's lies that the 2020  election was stolen it was not we're  going to walk down to the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,283520,290160,and we're going to cheer on  our brave senators and  congressmen and women
1GS2uybciaU,290160,296479,and we're probably not going to be  cheering so much for  some of them angry rioters clashing with
1GS2uybciaU,296479,302639,police  breaching the capitol steps going inside  the building to try to stop the counting
1GS2uybciaU,302639,308400,of electoral votes that would officially  make joe biden the president  five people died two of whom were
1GS2uybciaU,308400,314320,officers who died by suicide after the  insurrection and about 140 people were  hurt with one and a half million dollars
1GS2uybciaU,314320,321520,worth of damages to the capitol building  itself across the country shock and at  first fury and at the capitol a new
1GS2uybciaU,321520,327600,committee created intending to  investigate and report on what led up to  what they called the domestic terrorist
1GS2uybciaU,327600,334639,attack on the capitol the committee's  creation controversial with many  republicans decrying it as overly
1GS2uybciaU,334639,339919,partisan and democrats insisting it is a  fact-finding mission ultimately seven
1GS2uybciaU,339919,346080,democrats and two republicans began  their work in late july of 2021 with  public testimony from four police
1GS2uybciaU,346080,351360,officers who defended the capitol on  january 6. we simply want justice and
1GS2uybciaU,351360,357600,accountability  for most people generally six happened  for a few hours
1GS2uybciaU,357600,364240,before  but for all  for those of us who work were in the  thick of it
1GS2uybciaU,364240,371120,it has not ended since then the  committee has conducted more than a  thousand depositions and interviews  behind closed doors received more than
1GS2uybciaU,371120,377600,140 000 documents and issued 98 public  subpoenas  some complied with the subpoenas like
1GS2uybciaU,377600,384800,some members of the trump family and  former white house aide former white  house chief of staff mark meadows did  not testify at deposition scheduled by
1GS2uybciaU,384800,390319,the house committee investigating that  capital riot others refused to testify  like former white house chief of staff
1GS2uybciaU,390319,397039,mark meadows and former white house  aides steve bannon peter navarro and dan  scavino all four have since been held in
1GS2uybciaU,397039,403840,contempt of congress for refusing to  testify former trump aide steve bannon  indicted for contempt of congress bannon
1GS2uybciaU,403840,409280,and navarro were also indicted by a  federal grand jury for contempt of  congress both refusing to provide the
1GS2uybciaU,409280,414880,committee with documents or testimony  the committee more recently escalating  its investigation by subpoenaing members
1GS2uybciaU,414880,420639,of congress they just issued subpoenas  to five sitting members of congress
1GS2uybciaU,420639,428560,including the house republican leader  kevin mccarthy but all five of those  members have declined to testify so far
1GS2uybciaU,430000,436720,they just want to go after their  political opponents so what are the  committee's big revelations to this  point first text messages showed members
1GS2uybciaU,436720,442479,of congress journalists and even members  of the president's own family begging  mark meadows to tell former president
1GS2uybciaU,442479,448720,trump to stop the insurrection messages  initially obtained by cnn  second the committee found a more than
1GS2uybciaU,448720,454240,seven hour gap in white house phone logs  during the riot when they know former  president trump had been in touch with
1GS2uybciaU,454240,460400,republican lawmakers like leader  mccarthy and alabama senator tommy  tuberville
1GS2uybciaU,460400,465919,hallie jackson joins us now live from  washington d.c and hadley i know you  watched the january 6 events unfold what
1GS2uybciaU,465919,471919,were your thoughts then and what has  surprised you most as we get underway  tonight yeah tom part of our coverage
1GS2uybciaU,471919,478080,actually here on nbc news for a special  report that was supposed to last you  know a short amount of time through the  certification of these election results
1GS2uybciaU,478080,483520,and then and then stretched on for hours  there at the time i was covering the  trump white house and so for me the
1GS2uybciaU,483520,491039,biggest reporting suit pursuit was  trying to find out in these minutes in  these hours what was donald trump doing
1GS2uybciaU,491039,497840,that was a huge part of our um of the  questions that i was asking sources that  day the the areas that i was you know
1GS2uybciaU,497840,504000,really really focused on what i think is  surprising or at least interesting about  now tom is that is still the same
1GS2uybciaU,504000,509520,question that these committee  investigators have what was donald trump  doing as they seek to link him to this
1GS2uybciaU,509520,515360,broader conspiracy as you and garrett  hake laid out potentially connecting the  dots between the insurrection and then
1GS2uybciaU,515360,521279,the actions of the former president at  the time  that is  why you will see a lot of this laid out
1GS2uybciaU,521279,527040,and i think that's going to be the focus  of these hearings as we move forward  tonight is a big night it is the start  but it is just the start you know
1GS2uybciaU,527040,533200,there's more hearings to come tom hallie  i know you had the chance to speak with  the widow of a dc police officer jeffrey
1GS2uybciaU,533200,539200,smith he is one of four police officers  who took his life after the capitol  riots officers who responded to that on
1GS2uybciaU,539200,545519,january 6. what did she tell you that  she hopes happens in the days ahead  i'm glad you asked about this tom thank
1GS2uybciaU,545519,550880,you because officer jeff smith was she  described him a jokester you know  lighthearted guy was an amazing guy
1GS2uybciaU,550880,557279,loved his dog loved being a son and a  husband he died by suicide nine days  after the insurrection and it was only
1GS2uybciaU,557279,564000,in march tom that that death was  formally declared a line of duty death  because of the trauma he suffered on the
1GS2uybciaU,564000,569360,day of the insurrection  what she told me to your question about  what she wanted to see moving forward
1GS2uybciaU,569360,574959,she hopes that americans people watching  understand that people like her husband
1GS2uybciaU,574959,581600,gave their lives in service of  protecting democracy on that day and  what's also interesting you know what  her attorney told me
1GS2uybciaU,581600,589040,there are discussions she's going to be  in this hearing room tonight okay she's  going she's going to be there in the  room with two other partners spouses of
1GS2uybciaU,589040,595440,officers who lost their lives in the  aftermath of january 6. and then she has  a meeting with one of the staff  directors one of the members of the sort
1GS2uybciaU,595440,602079,of aides that work on this committee  about possibly being a witness herself  tom so it's possible that she will have
1GS2uybciaU,602079,608959,an even more public platform to talk  about the person you're seeing on screen  her beloved husband  jeff as she as she calls him of course
1GS2uybciaU,608959,615440,and what his life meant  and how violent in her view that day was  what he witnessed what she knows he
1GS2uybciaU,615440,621360,witnessed based on his body cam video  that has now come out etc um and so for  her it is it's accountability on a small
1GS2uybciaU,621360,627440,scale but but more broadly it's about  making sure that people understand the  legacy that officer smith and others
1GS2uybciaU,627440,633279,leave behind hallie jackson for us halle  i know you'll be standing by for us as  well we thank you for your reporting so
1GS2uybciaU,633279,638959,as we have mentioned this is the  congressional investigation this is not  the criminal investigation but there is
1GS2uybciaU,638959,644959,a criminal investigation that has been  ongoing since january 6. i want to bring  in pete williams right now who joins us
1GS2uybciaU,644959,650000,he's uh our chief correspondent that  covers the justice department for us  pete if you can give our viewers an
1GS2uybciaU,650000,655200,update where does the criminal  investigation stand and i know i asked  you this after hundreds and hundreds of
1GS2uybciaU,655200,660560,arrests have already been made  yeah and that number keeps going up this  is the largest criminal investigation in
1GS2uybciaU,660560,666480,the justice department's history  more than 800 people have now been  charged and this investigation is
1GS2uybciaU,666480,672720,nowhere near done because the goal of  the justice department is certainly to  try to charge anybody who attacked a
1GS2uybciaU,672720,679360,police officer or did any damage to the  capitol but also they've charged people  who were merely in the capitol or on the
1GS2uybciaU,679360,684800,capitol grounds 300 of those people have  already pleaded guilty six of them were
1GS2uybciaU,684800,691360,convicted at trial one person has been  acquitted but the investigation is  nowhere near over now that's the
1GS2uybciaU,691360,698399,investigation of what happened on  january 6th but there is a separate  investigation or you could say an
1GS2uybciaU,698399,705360,offshoot of that investigation of  whether any criminal laws were violated  before january 6. we know the justice
1GS2uybciaU,705360,711040,department is looking at the actions of  republicans in seven states that sent
1GS2uybciaU,711040,718160,alternate slates of electors in to the  national archives saying you know count  us we're the tr where the trump votes or
1GS2uybciaU,718160,723920,in the case of two of those states count  us if the courts throw out the other  votes those are states which in which
1GS2uybciaU,723920,729279,joe biden won the popular vote so  there's a question about whether they  had any legal right to do that or
1GS2uybciaU,729279,735839,whether that amounted to fraud and we  know that there is a broadening federal  investigation looking at what role
1GS2uybciaU,735839,742880,people around the president had in  trying to explore these alternate routes  to try to undermine the electoral vote
1GS2uybciaU,742880,748240,you know pete as we take another live  look at the hearing room where these  this committee will present their
1GS2uybciaU,748240,754240,evidence  it's sort of incredible because on that  day  the capital turned into a crime scene
1GS2uybciaU,754240,761839,right  and i i wonder because the republicans  are attacking this hearing tonight will  the fbi learn anything from this will
1GS2uybciaU,761839,768639,will congress uncover anything the fbi  doesn't already know  oh undoubtedly because the committee has
1GS2uybciaU,768639,773920,talked to some people that the justice  department has not and of course vice  versa
1GS2uybciaU,773920,780079,and nobody that we know of has been  immunized for their testimony before the  house committee that we know of that
1GS2uybciaU,780079,785600,would prevent that testimony from being  used in a congress in a federal  investigation that's always the thing
1GS2uybciaU,785600,792079,you worry about when there are parallel  investigations like this but i think a  lot of what the justice department has
1GS2uybciaU,792079,797360,done they don't really need the  congressional committee and of course  the congressional committee's role here
1GS2uybciaU,797360,803440,is not to build evidence for a criminal  conviction although that may be a goal  of some members of the committee you
1GS2uybciaU,803440,809120,know i have to ask you i know just a few  hours ago a republican candidate for  governor in michigan faced a judge for
1GS2uybciaU,809120,814880,the first time after being arrested for  his alleged involvement in the capital  riots i mean
1GS2uybciaU,814880,820079,even years later they're still  uncovering facts and still finding  suspects
1GS2uybciaU,820079,826560,oh every day we see new charges filed  that the justice department or the fbi  has been investigating for a long time
1GS2uybciaU,826560,832320,they first got a tip about the man  you're talking about ryan kelly who's a  republican candidate for governor in
1GS2uybciaU,832320,837440,michigan in the primary they got a tip  about him 10 days after the election but
1GS2uybciaU,837440,844000,it's taken all this time to build a case  against him based on photographs  surveillance video and and interviews
1GS2uybciaU,844000,849920,with informants and other people who  knew him who said yep that's him at  outside the capitol he says i never went
1GS2uybciaU,849920,856480,into the capital i never harmed any  policemen i never pushed over any police  barricades but nonetheless he faces four
1GS2uybciaU,856480,862959,misdemeanor counts for in essence  glorified trespassing being on the west  front of the capitol that was closed off
1GS2uybciaU,862959,869279,all right pete williams for us tonight  who i know will be watching all this  evidence closely and watching what they  are going to be showing viewers american
1GS2uybciaU,869279,874880,viewers for the first time pete we thank  you for that we are about 20 minutes now  less than 20 minutes from the house
1GS2uybciaU,874880,880959,opening uh their committee and and  hearing the opening remarks and seeing  this video that they have touted so much
1GS2uybciaU,880959,887839,a lot of this basically the entire  portion of this is about the transfer of  power and people that that tried to stop
1GS2uybciaU,887839,894079,it right and and the question i have is  will the president president biden be  watching this tonight i want to bring in
1GS2uybciaU,894079,900800,chief white house correspondent kristen  welker she's in washington for us so so  kristen what do we know we know  president biden is in california for the
1GS2uybciaU,900800,906880,summit of the americas and he made some  comments earlier today  he sure did tom look i've been talking  to white house officials who tell me
1GS2uybciaU,906880,912639,that president biden is expected to  watch at least part of this first  january 6 committee hearing tonight
1GS2uybciaU,912639,918560,while he's in california he's there  hosting an international summit of the  americas now it's worth noting there's a
1GS2uybciaU,918560,924800,large gap in the president's schedule  before he hosts a dinner tonight so it  would not be a surprise if he used that
1GS2uybciaU,924800,931839,time to tune in the summit mr biden is  attending is focused on issues like  covid and migration but the hearing is
1GS2uybciaU,931839,938160,clearly top of mind as well as you  pointed out tom the president talked  about it unprompted while he was holding
1GS2uybciaU,938160,944000,a bilateral meeting with the prime  minister of canada take a listen to what  he had to say
1GS2uybciaU,944000,952639,again one of the things can occupy  my country tonight  i suspect is the first open hearings on
1GS2uybciaU,952639,958160,january the 6th  and  as i said when it was occurring and
1GS2uybciaU,958160,964720,subsequent  i think it was a clear  flagrant violation of the constitution
1GS2uybciaU,964720,970399,i think these guys and women broke the  law tried to turn around the
1GS2uybciaU,970399,976639,result of an election  and  there's a lot of questions who's  responsible who's involved
1GS2uybciaU,976639,981680,i'm not going to make a judgment on that  but i just want to know that much of  this we're going to probably be
1GS2uybciaU,981680,988480,a lot of americans are going to be  seeing for the first time some of the  detail  that that occurred
1GS2uybciaU,988480,994160,now tom the white house wants to be  careful about not being seen as  politicizing the hearing especially
1GS2uybciaU,994160,1000800,given the ongoing investigation by the  justice department that you were just  talking about with pete and don't expect  a rapid response from the white house
1GS2uybciaU,1000800,1006240,throughout the night officials have said  since the president took office they  want to be selective about moments he
1GS2uybciaU,1006240,1011920,weighs in on january 6. still that  doesn't mean we won't get some type of  response from top democrats and
1GS2uybciaU,1011920,1018720,republicans who are clearly watching  tonight's proceedings very closely tom  all right kristen welker for us tonight  kristen we do appreciate that as we take
1GS2uybciaU,1018720,1024240,a live look inside of that hearing room  right now looks like possibly some  witnesses are starting to enter the room
1GS2uybciaU,1024240,1030959,slowly trickling again we're about 15  minutes away from this hearing getting  underway uh there are two main parties
1GS2uybciaU,1030959,1037038,in the united states the democrats and  we've heard christian reporting on what  the white house is doing and the  republicans and and we know that many
1GS2uybciaU,1037038,1042798,people who are on if not  every single rider there on the  president's side um
1GS2uybciaU,1042798,1048400,von hilliard has been covering the  republicans for us and the primaries and  and is covering some trump rallies since
1GS2uybciaU,1048400,1053520,january 6th for us and vaughn i guess my  first question to you is what are you  hearing out there on the trail and and
1GS2uybciaU,1053520,1059520,and what is team trump saying on a day  like today you know this is if we if i  could go back to january 6 i was
1GS2uybciaU,1059520,1064960,actually at the capitol outside of it  that day there and i think what we all  took away in those days after were the
1GS2uybciaU,1064960,1070720,number of republicans that were  separating themselves from donald trump  even kevin mccarthy and the new
1GS2uybciaU,1070720,1077760,audiotapes that have been released  saying that we got to get to the bottom  of this that is not the message of the  republican party here today and that is
1GS2uybciaU,1077760,1083679,why you are seeing a unified  message here not only from donald  trump's orbit but also the republican
1GS2uybciaU,1083679,1089760,national committee as well as top  republican house leadership here up on  capitol hill this is largely a united
1GS2uybciaU,1089760,1095760,front here and they are pushing back on  this is a theater they're saying that  this is the same story that everybody
1GS2uybciaU,1095760,1101360,has been tuned into for the last year  and a half and they make the case ahead  of these midterms coming up in november
1GS2uybciaU,1101360,1108720,that while democrats are focused on  january 6 they're focused on issues like  inflation gas prices and the baby
1GS2uybciaU,1108720,1114559,formula shortage here those are the  issues that they are focused on and that  is what they're going to try to drive  home in these weeks ahead during these
1GS2uybciaU,1114559,1120799,hearings one of the leaders of this  committee is one of the heads of the  committee of course is liz chaney a  republican representative from wyoming
1GS2uybciaU,1120799,1126160,and she has not stopped since she has  started right and and the more evidence  she has seen the more subpoenas that
1GS2uybciaU,1126160,1132559,have come through the more  interviews they've had she has stayed  pretty sort of straight in that she is
1GS2uybciaU,1132559,1138320,not wavering at all in this and she's  come under a lot of attacks and you were  in wyoming and what did you find there
1GS2uybciaU,1138320,1144320,yeah i mean i found a lot of wyoming  republicans who were calling her traitor  i think we actually got a couple of them
1GS2uybciaU,1144320,1150880,on tape that we could play okay  why not liz cheney
1GS2uybciaU,1150880,1156080,she's a traitor he's liz janey yeah  she's a traitor the big question harriet
1GS2uybciaU,1156080,1161840,hageman or liz chaney oh hey  no question why not liz cheney because
1GS2uybciaU,1161840,1167200,she's a sellout yes betrayal  you heard that traitor over and over
1GS2uybciaU,1167200,1173360,traitor traitor betrayal that's her home  state her dad dick cheney was first  elected to congress in wyoming more than
1GS2uybciaU,1173360,1179520,four decades ago she is getting a  primary challenge by a woman harriet  hageman she's an attorney long-time gop
1GS2uybciaU,1179520,1185360,activist in the state that primary is  just over two months away again when we  look at the republican party there are
1GS2uybciaU,1185360,1191840,so few individuals who are forcefully  speaking out against donald trump and  what took place on january 6th adam
1GS2uybciaU,1191840,1197120,kinzinger tom rice liz cheney it's a  very small group do you think liz cheney  is going to lose that primary race
1GS2uybciaU,1197120,1203360,because of her stance here she's looking  at a very tough competition and a  potential loss in august we got to get  to a quick break vaughn hillard we

1GS2uybciaU,1344880,1349919,and welcome back we are looking at a  live look right now at a house committee  room as uh we are less than 10 minutes
1GS2uybciaU,1349919,1356080,away from this hearing getting underway  on the january 6 capital riot and the  prime time hearing the decision by the
1GS2uybciaU,1356080,1362159,january 6 select committee to hold a  prime time televised hearing is not one  without implications so what are those
1GS2uybciaU,1362159,1367760,political implications for both  republicans and democrats nbc news  political director chuck todd joins us
1GS2uybciaU,1367760,1373440,now chuck are democrats gambling here  asking for prime time hours sort of
1GS2uybciaU,1373440,1378640,building up this some people may say  spectacle and and not be able to deliver
1GS2uybciaU,1378640,1383919,or do are they so confident that what  they're going to show and what americans  are going to hear is is going to put the
1GS2uybciaU,1383919,1389679,january 6 rights back at the forefront  of the american psyche  well i guess i would take door number
1GS2uybciaU,1389679,1395440,three tom and just say if they if they  didn't push for a prime time hearing if  they didn't push for the biggest
1GS2uybciaU,1395440,1401120,possible platform then what are they  doing meaning is their inve you know  they keep telling us how much they keep
1GS2uybciaU,1401120,1408480,finding they keep telling us how  important this investigation is so i  guess i would look at it from the  perspective of if they didn't try to get
1GS2uybciaU,1408480,1415520,this in prime time  then what are they doing then you know  it  if it is the level of seriousness that i
1GS2uybciaU,1415520,1421919,think you and i believe it is and  certainly those folks on the committee i  mean i think you you have to uh
1GS2uybciaU,1421919,1427679,sort of make your case on the biggest  stage possible so look i am i'll tell  you one thing that has surprised me
1GS2uybciaU,1427679,1433520,though tom is the  the fact that you've had some members of  this committee including jamie raskin
1GS2uybciaU,1433520,1440400,basically saying this is going to be a  blockbuster you're like okay  yeah because usually in politics they  lower the bar usually in politics they
1GS2uybciaU,1440400,1446400,lower the bar  these guys aren't doing it and i you  know look i do think i worry about a
1GS2uybciaU,1446400,1452000,couple things with these hearings  tonight i worry number one that the  country is just numb
1GS2uybciaU,1452000,1458400,to to uh instability these days right  we've been dealing with constant crises  in this country for seven years
1GS2uybciaU,1458400,1463440,you know and every day there's a new  crisis so i don't know  something that should rattle us may not
1GS2uybciaU,1463440,1470000,rattle us right that's number one and  then the second impediment i think this  committee is facing  is a number that you and i talked about
1GS2uybciaU,1470000,1475840,i think earlier this week and i was i  was pretty fired up about and that was  the the percentage of americans who
1GS2uybciaU,1475840,1481279,believe that that people who run for  office are just doing it for  self-serving purposes
1GS2uybciaU,1481279,1486880,and only 20 of the public thinks people  run for office to do the greater good
1GS2uybciaU,1486880,1492400,so  how am i you know  this poor committee whatever you no  matter what your politics is they start
1GS2uybciaU,1492400,1498000,out with incredibly low credibility  simply because they're elected officials  that's how bad our
1GS2uybciaU,1498000,1504799,our politics is right now how much the  public in general is leery and  distrustful so
1GS2uybciaU,1504799,1511039,this to me puts this committee they got  to show their receipts they got to not  just show us a good show they got to
1GS2uybciaU,1511039,1517360,show the receipts and have them all  documented to have a chance at a  skeptical american public to soak it in
1GS2uybciaU,1517360,1523120,so chuck the latest because you  mentioned a poll the latest nbc news  poll reveals that i think we have the  numbers here that that the american
1GS2uybciaU,1523120,1528799,public does not hold the former  president responsible for these attacks  anymore a majority of those people that
1GS2uybciaU,1528799,1535039,were pulled the needle has shifted since  january i think only 17 percent hold  them solely responsible uh here's the
1GS2uybciaU,1535039,1542080,poll right here 18 somewhat responsible  and if you look you know with how those  numbers are changing my question is did
1GS2uybciaU,1542080,1548640,this did this committee wait too long  chuck to have this night is it too late  because republicans are already out with
1GS2uybciaU,1548640,1553679,their oppo saying why isn't there an  inflation hearing why isn't there a gas  price prime time hearing so i'm
1GS2uybciaU,1553679,1559200,wondering about the timing tonight well  look i'm with you tom i think this is  something that should have been last uh
1GS2uybciaU,1559200,1566240,at the end of the fall or the beginning  of the winter in calendar year 2021  right something you know i i if but of
1GS2uybciaU,1566240,1572080,course this took a while had we had a  bipartisan commission i mean let's go  back in time here a little bit the
1GS2uybciaU,1572080,1578320,biggest regret that i think many people  have including those on that committee  is that this isn't
1GS2uybciaU,1578320,1585039,a bipartisan commission  uh a la  the 911 commission or the iraq war study
1GS2uybciaU,1585039,1591919,group or the warren commission you know  you could have had condoleezza rice and  tom daschle right former democratic
1GS2uybciaU,1591919,1598400,senate majority leader former republican  secretary of state you know and i'm just  picking those two people right now could  have been you know you could have had al
1GS2uybciaU,1598400,1604480,gore and connie rice you could have had  you know uh uh other just two  secretaries of state do it but the point
1GS2uybciaU,1604480,1609600,is there there was a way that this could  have been done with a ton of bipartisan
1GS2uybciaU,1609600,1616880,credibility and the republicans shut it  down right mitch mcconnell decided not  to do this uh and i just think it was a
1GS2uybciaU,1616880,1621919,it that to me is the biggest regret of  all of this because i think this is  important information and i do think too
1GS2uybciaU,1621919,1627520,many people are going to view it with  through a political and it's interesting  because that first poll you mentioned  liz cheney we were just talking to von
1GS2uybciaU,1627520,1633600,hilliard earlier likely to lose her seat  because she's standing on her what she  believes are her principles and she
1GS2uybciaU,1633600,1640559,believes in this committee and it could  cost her her own seat uh chuck todd we  know you're going to be with the entire  nbc news team throughout the coverage of
1GS2uybciaU,1640559,1648480,this we appreciate your analysis we are  just minutes away from this hearing  we'll have more live coverage in just a  few minutes stay with us

1GS2uybciaU,1900799,1905919,documented events in american history  the insurrection of january 6 played out
1GS2uybciaU,1905919,1912080,live on tv  and since then even more chilling videos  have emerged of rioters overpowering
1GS2uybciaU,1912080,1919440,capitol police and storming the halls of  congress but there is still so much we  do not yet know about that day
1GS2uybciaU,1919440,1926000,tonight the january 6 committee will try  to make the case that former president  donald trump was directly responsible
1GS2uybciaU,1926000,1931600,for those events as part of an effort to  overturn the results of the 2020  election
1GS2uybciaU,1931600,1939039,these hearings are a result of a  year-long investigation by the january 6  committee it has issued nearly 100
1GS2uybciaU,1939039,1945760,subpoenas and interviewed more than a  thousand witnesses some from former  president trump's inner circle both his

1GS2uybciaU,1963200,1969279,our viewers we will air what is  displayed by the committee  much of the focus will be on president
1GS2uybciaU,1969279,1976880,trump his false claims that the election  was stolen what he said at a rally in  the hours leading up to the attack and
1GS2uybciaU,1976880,1983760,his actions while the assault was  underway mr trump and his allies have  described these hearings as a partisan
1GS2uybciaU,1983760,1988880,witch-hunt democrats do lead the  committee alongside only two republicans
1GS2uybciaU,1988880,1995200,both of them had previously voted to  impeach the former president  we should know this is not a legal
1GS2uybciaU,1995200,2001919,proceeding no one is on trial the  committee says the goal is to learn what  happened so it never happens again
1GS2uybciaU,2001919,2008399,tonight we're told will serve as a sort  of opening argument the first in a  series of hearings that will be very
1GS2uybciaU,2008399,2014559,different than traditional congressional  hearings the committee has hired a  television consultant to help produce it
1GS2uybciaU,2014559,2021200,for a prime time audience so while it  will begin with opening statements from  the chairman democrat benny thompson and
1GS2uybciaU,2021200,2027919,vice chair republican liz chaney even  those statements will have video  components our teams are standing by for
1GS2uybciaU,2027919,2033279,full coverage of this historic hearing  but let's take you inside the hearing  room now where chairman thompson is
1GS2uybciaU,2033279,2039519,starting things off  i'm benny thompson chairman of the  january 6th

1GS2uybciaU,2063358,2069440,the ku klux klan and lynching  i'm reminded of that dark history as i
1GS2uybciaU,2069440,2075118,hear voices today try and justify the  actions of the insurrectionists on
1GS2uybciaU,2075118,2080560,january 6 20 21  over the next few weeks
1GS2uybciaU,2080560,2086638,hopefully you will get to know  the other members my colleagues up here
1GS2uybciaU,2086638,2092560,and me  we represent a diversity of communities  from all over the united states
1GS2uybciaU,2092560,2099280,rural areas and cities  east coast  west coast and the heartland
1GS2uybciaU,2099280,2105040,all of us have one thing in common  we swore the same oath
1GS2uybciaU,2105040,2112640,that same oath that all members of  congress take upon taking office and  afterwards every two years if they are
1GS2uybciaU,2112640,2117839,reelected  we swore an oath to defend the  constitution
1GS2uybciaU,2117839,2123599,against all enemies  foreign  and domestic
1GS2uybciaU,2123599,2129040,the words of the current oath taken by  all of us  that nearly every united states
1GS2uybciaU,2129040,2134079,government employee takes  have their roots in the civil war
1GS2uybciaU,2134079,2139520,throughout our history the united states  has fought against foreign enemies to
1GS2uybciaU,2139520,2144800,preserve our democracy electoral system  and country
1GS2uybciaU,2144800,2150320,when the united states capital was  stormed and burned in 1814
1GS2uybciaU,2150320,2158240,foreign enemies were responsible  after war in 1862 when american citizens
1GS2uybciaU,2158240,2164640,had taken up arms against this country  congress adopted a new oath to help make
1GS2uybciaU,2164640,2170079,sure no person who had supported the  rebellion could hold a position of
1GS2uybciaU,2170079,2177520,public trust  therefore  congresspersons and united states  federal government employees were
1GS2uybciaU,2177520,2183920,required for the first time  to swear an oath to defend the  constitution
1GS2uybciaU,2183920,2191920,against all enemies foreign and domestic  that oath was put to test on january 6
1GS2uybciaU,2191920,2197760,2021  the police officers who held the line  that day
1GS2uybciaU,2197760,2204079,honored their oath  many came out of that day  blooded and broken
1GS2uybciaU,2204079,2211280,they still bear those wounds visible and  invisible  they did their duty
1GS2uybciaU,2211280,2216640,they repel the mob and ended the  occupation of the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,2216640,2224400,they defended the constitution against  domestic enemies  so that congress could return
1GS2uybciaU,2224400,2231119,uphold our own oath  and count your votes to ensure the  transfer of power
1GS2uybciaU,2231119,2238160,just as we've done for hundreds of years  but unlike in 1814
1GS2uybciaU,2238160,2243839,it was domestic enemies of the  constitution who stormed the capital and
1GS2uybciaU,2243839,2249040,occupied the capital  who sought to throt the will of the  people
1GS2uybciaU,2249040,2255280,to stop the transfer of power  and so they did so at the encouragement
1GS2uybciaU,2255280,2260640,of the president of the united states  the president of the united states
1GS2uybciaU,2260640,2268240,trying to stop the transfer of power  a precedent that had stood for 220 years
1GS2uybciaU,2268240,2273760,even as our democracy had faced its most  difficult test
1GS2uybciaU,2273760,2279040,thinking back again to the civil war  in the summer of 1864
1GS2uybciaU,2279040,2284720,the president of the united states  believed he would be
1GS2uybciaU,2284720,2290880,doomed to bid his bid for reelection  he believed his opponent
1GS2uybciaU,2290880,2295920,general george mcclellan  would wave the white flag when it came
1GS2uybciaU,2295920,2302079,to preserving the union but even with  that grim fate hanging in the balance
1GS2uybciaU,2302079,2308400,president lincoln was ready to accept  the will of the voters  come what may
1GS2uybciaU,2308400,2313440,he made a quiet pledge  he wrote down the words
1GS2uybciaU,2313440,2320720,this morning  as for some days past  it seems exceedingly probable that this
1GS2uybciaU,2320720,2327680,administration will not be reelected  then it will be my duty to so cooperate
1GS2uybciaU,2327680,2332960,with the president-elect  it will be my duty
1GS2uybciaU,2332960,2338839,lincoln sealed that memo and asked his  cabinet secretaries to sign it sight
1GS2uybciaU,2338839,2344480,unseen he asked them to make the same  commitment he did
1GS2uybciaU,2344480,2350400,to accept defeat  if indeed defeat was the will of the  people
1GS2uybciaU,2350400,2355520,to uphold the rule of law  to do whatever president who came before
1GS2uybciaU,2355520,2361119,him did  and what every president who followed  him would do
1GS2uybciaU,2361119,2369599,until donald trump  donald trump lost the presidential  election in 2020 the american people
1GS2uybciaU,2369599,2375280,voted him out of office  it was not because of a rigged system
1GS2uybciaU,2375280,2380880,it was not because of voter fraud  don't believe me
1GS2uybciaU,2380880,2388560,hear what his former attorney general  had to say about it  i warned those who watching
1GS2uybciaU,2388560,2394760,that this connect contains strong  language
1GS2uybciaU,2396160,2402480,no just what i've i've been i've had i  had three discussions with the president  that i can recall one was on november
1GS2uybciaU,2402480,2409119,23rd  one was on december first and one was on  december 14th and i've been through
1GS2uybciaU,2409119,2415200,sort of the give and take of those  discussions and in that context i made  it clear i did not agree with
1GS2uybciaU,2415200,2421040,the idea of saying the election was  stolen and putting out this stuff which  i told the president was
1GS2uybciaU,2421040,2426560,and uh  you know i didn't want to be a part of  it and that's one of the reasons that
1GS2uybciaU,2426560,2433200,went into me deciding to leave when i  did i  observed uh i think it was on december
1GS2uybciaU,2433200,2439280,1st that you know how can we you can't  live in a world where where the  incumbent administration stays in power
1GS2uybciaU,2439280,2445760,based on its view  unsupported by specific evidence  that the election that there was fraud
1GS2uybciaU,2445760,2452319,in the election  bill bar on election day 2020 he was the
1GS2uybciaU,2452319,2457839,attorney general of the united states  the top law enforcement official in the
1GS2uybciaU,2457839,2463839,country  telling the president exactly what he  thought about claims of a stolen
1GS2uybciaU,2463839,2469359,election  donald trump had his days in court to  challenge the results
1GS2uybciaU,2469359,2475200,he was within his rights to seek those  judgment  in the united states
1GS2uybciaU,2475200,2481200,law-abiding citizens have those tools  for pursuing justice he lost in the
1GS2uybciaU,2481200,2486800,courts just as he did at the ballot box  and in this country
1GS2uybciaU,2486800,2493280,that's the end of the line  but for donald trump  that was only the beginning of what
1GS2uybciaU,2493280,2499440,became a sprawling multi-step conspiracy  aimed at overturning the presidential
1GS2uybciaU,2499440,2506000,election  aimed at throwing out the votes of  millions of americans your votes
1GS2uybciaU,2506000,2511040,your voice in our democracy and  replacing the will of the american
1GS2uybciaU,2511040,2517440,people with his will to remain in power  after his turn ended
1GS2uybciaU,2517440,2524800,donald trump was at the center of this  conspiracy  and ultimately donald trump the
1GS2uybciaU,2524800,2530000,president of the united states  spurred a mob of domestic enemies of the
1GS2uybciaU,2530000,2536720,constitution  to march down the capitol and subvert  american democracy
1GS2uybciaU,2536720,2541760,any legal jargon you hear about  seditious conspiracy
1GS2uybciaU,2541760,2548319,obstruction of an official proceeding  conspiracy to defraud the united states
1GS2uybciaU,2548319,2553680,boils down to this  january 6 was the culmination of an
1GS2uybciaU,2553680,2559280,attempted coup  a brazen attempt as one riot to put it
1GS2uybciaU,2559280,2566480,shortly after january 6 to overthrow the  government the violence was no accident
1GS2uybciaU,2566480,2573119,it represents  senate trump's last stand  most desperate chance to halt the
1GS2uybciaU,2573119,2580240,transfer of power  now you may hear those words and think  this is just another political attack on
1GS2uybciaU,2580240,2585839,donald trump  by people who don't like him  that's not the case
1GS2uybciaU,2585839,2593119,my colleagues and i all wanted an  outside independent commission  to investigate january 6
1GS2uybciaU,2593119,2600319,similar to what we had  after 9 11.  but after first agreeing to the idea
1GS2uybciaU,2600319,2605680,donald trump's allies in congress put a  stop to it  apparently
1GS2uybciaU,2605680,2613040,they don't want january 6 investigated  at all  and in the last 17 months many of those
1GS2uybciaU,2613040,2618880,same people have tried to whitewash what  happened on january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,2618880,2627200,to rewrite history  call it a tourist visit  label it legitimate political discourse
1GS2uybciaU,2627200,2632800,donald trump and his followers have  adopted the words of the songwriter
1GS2uybciaU,2632800,2639040,do you believe me  or your lying eyes  we can't sweep what happened
1GS2uybciaU,2639040,2645119,under the rug  the american people deserve answers  so i come before you
1GS2uybciaU,2645119,2651359,this evening not as a democrat but as an  american who swore an oath to defend the
1GS2uybciaU,2651359,2658160,constitution  the constitution doesn't protect just  democrats or just republicans
1GS2uybciaU,2658160,2664079,it protects all of us  we the people  and this scheme was an attempt to
1GS2uybciaU,2664079,2671040,undermine the will of the people  so tonight  and over the next few weeks
1GS2uybciaU,2671040,2677839,we're going to remind you of the reality  of what happened that day but our work
1GS2uybciaU,2677839,2683599,must do much more than just look  backwards  because of our democracy remains in
1GS2uybciaU,2683599,2689200,danger  the conspiracy to thought the will of  the people is not over
1GS2uybciaU,2689200,2694960,there are those in this audience who  thirst for power but have no love or
1GS2uybciaU,2694960,2700480,respect for what makes america great  devotion to the constitution
1GS2uybciaU,2700480,2706000,allegiance to the rule of law  a shared journey to build a more perfect
1GS2uybciaU,2706000,2711440,union  january 6th and the lies that led
1GS2uybciaU,2711440,2718160,to insurrection have put two and a half  centuries of constitutional democracy at
1GS2uybciaU,2718160,2725920,risk  the world is watching what we do here  america has long been expected to be a
1GS2uybciaU,2725920,2732480,shining city on the hill  a beacon of hope and freedom  a model for others
1GS2uybciaU,2732480,2737520,when we are at our best  how can we play that role when our house
1GS2uybciaU,2737520,2742720,is in such disorder  we must confront the truth with candor
1GS2uybciaU,2742720,2750400,resolve and determination  we need to show that we are worthy of  the gifts that are the birthright of
1GS2uybciaU,2750400,2758079,every american  that begins here and it begins now  with a true accounting of what happened
1GS2uybciaU,2758079,2764240,and what led to the attack  on our constitution and our democracy
1GS2uybciaU,2764240,2771680,in this moment  when the dangers of our constitution and  our democracy loom large nothing could
1GS2uybciaU,2771680,2779280,be more important  working alongside the public servants on  this diaz has been one of the greatest
1GS2uybciaU,2779280,2784480,honors of my time in congress  it's been a particular privilege to
1GS2uybciaU,2784480,2792640,count as a partner in this effort  and to count as a friend  the gentlewoman from wyoming miss cheney

1GS2uybciaU,2833520,2838560,instead he justified it  these are the things and events that
1GS2uybciaU,2838560,2844400,happen he said when a sacred landslide  election victory is so unceremoniously
1GS2uybciaU,2844400,2849760,and viciously stripped away from great  patriots who've been badly and unfairly
1GS2uybciaU,2849760,2854960,treated for so long  as you will see in the hearings to come
1GS2uybciaU,2854960,2860240,president trump believed his supporters  at the capitol and i quote
1GS2uybciaU,2860240,2868000,were doing what they should be doing  this is what he told his staff as they  pleaded with him to call off the mob to
1GS2uybciaU,2868000,2875680,instruct his supporters to leave  over a series of hearings in the coming  weeks you will hear testimony live and
1GS2uybciaU,2875680,2880720,on video from more than half a dozen  former white house staff in the trump
1GS2uybciaU,2880720,2886800,administration  all of whom were in the west wing of the  white house on january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,2886800,2892720,you will hear testimony that quote the  president did not really want to put  anything out

1GS2uybciaU,2898640,2903920,yelling and quote  really angry at advisers who told him he
1GS2uybciaU,2903920,2909040,needed to be doing something more  and aware of the rioters chance to hang
1GS2uybciaU,2909040,2914640,mike pence the president responded with  this sentiment quote maybe our
1GS2uybciaU,2914640,2921440,supporters have the right idea  mike pence quote deserves it
1GS2uybciaU,2921440,2928960,you will hear evidence that president  trump refused for hours to do what his  staff his family and many of his other
1GS2uybciaU,2928960,2936960,advisors begged him to do  immediately instruct his supporters to  stand down and evacuate the capital
1GS2uybciaU,2936960,2942800,tonight  you will see never before seen footage  of the brutal attack on our capital
1GS2uybciaU,2942800,2948640,an attack that unfolded while a few  blocks away president trump sat watching

1GS2uybciaU,2955280,2962400,police officers  battling for their lives and ours  fighting to defend our democracy

1GS2uybciaU,2967520,2975119,tonight and in the weeks to come you  will see evidence of what motivated this  violence including directly from those
1GS2uybciaU,2975119,2982000,who participated in this attack  you will see video of them explaining  what caused them to do it
1GS2uybciaU,2982000,2988240,you will see their posts on social media  we will show you what they have said in  federal court
1GS2uybciaU,2988240,2993920,on this point there is no room for  debate  those who invaded our capital and
1GS2uybciaU,2993920,2999839,battled law enforcement for hours were  motivated by what president trump had  told them
1GS2uybciaU,2999839,3006720,that the election was stolen and that he  was the rightful president  president trump summoned the mob
1GS2uybciaU,3006720,3013200,assembled the mob and lit the flame of  this attack  you will also hear about plots to commit
1GS2uybciaU,3013200,3018720,seditious conspiracy on january 6th  a crime defined in our laws as
1GS2uybciaU,3018720,3024800,conspiring to overthrow put down or  destroy by force the government of the
1GS2uybciaU,3024800,3030559,united states  or to oppose by force the authority  thereof
1GS2uybciaU,3030559,3036960,multiple members of two groups the oath  keepers and the proud boys have been  charged with this crime for their
1GS2uybciaU,3036960,3043599,involvement in the events leading up to  and on january 6th  some have pled guilty
1GS2uybciaU,3043599,3050720,the attack on our capital was not a  spontaneous riot  intelligence available before january 6
1GS2uybciaU,3050720,3057280,identified plans to quote invade the  capital  occupy the capital and take other steps
1GS2uybciaU,3057280,3064400,to halt congress's count of electoral  votes that day  in our hearings to come we will identify
1GS2uybciaU,3064400,3071280,elements of those plans and we will show  specifically how a group of proud boys  led a mob into the capitol building on
1GS2uybciaU,3071280,3078240,january 6th  tonight i am going to describe for you  some of what our committee has learned
1GS2uybciaU,3078240,3083440,and highlight initial findings you will  see this month in our hearings
1GS2uybciaU,3083440,3089839,as you hear this  all americans should keep in fact in  mind this fact
1GS2uybciaU,3089839,3095119,on the morning of january 6th  president donald trump's intention was
1GS2uybciaU,3095119,3101040,to remain president of the united states  despite the lawful outcome of the 2020
1GS2uybciaU,3101040,3108559,election  and in violation of his constitutional  obligation to relinquish power
1GS2uybciaU,3108559,3114319,over multiple months donald trump  oversaw  and coordinated a sophisticated
1GS2uybciaU,3114319,3120960,seven-part plan to overturn the  presidential election and prevent the  transfer of presidential power
1GS2uybciaU,3120960,3126160,in our hearings you will see evidence of  each element of this plan
1GS2uybciaU,3126160,3133760,in our second hearing you will see that  donald trump and his advisors knew  that he had in fact lost the election
1GS2uybciaU,3133760,3139839,but despite this president trump engaged  in a massive effort to spread false and
1GS2uybciaU,3139839,3146800,fraudulent information  to convince huge portions of the u.s  population that fraud had stolen the
1GS2uybciaU,3146800,3152800,election from him  this was not true  jason miller was a senior trump campaign
1GS2uybciaU,3152800,3160480,spokesman  in this clip  miller describes a call between the  trump campaign's internal data expert
1GS2uybciaU,3160480,3166599,and president trump a few days after the  2020 election
1GS2uybciaU,3168160,3173680,i was in the oval office  um  and
1GS2uybciaU,3173680,3180720,at some point in the conversation matt  oskowski who is the lead data person was  brought on and
1GS2uybciaU,3180720,3187839,i remember he delivered to the president  pretty blunt terms  that he was going to lose
1GS2uybciaU,3187839,3193760,and that was based on mr miller on  madd and the data team's assessment of
1GS2uybciaU,3193760,3199599,the sort of county by county state by  state  results as reported
1GS2uybciaU,3199599,3205440,correct  alex cannon was one of president trump's
1GS2uybciaU,3205440,3211599,campaign lawyers he previously worked  for the trump organization  one of his responsibilities was to
1GS2uybciaU,3211599,3218079,assess allegations of election fraud in  november 2020.  here is one sample of his testimony
1GS2uybciaU,3218079,3224319,discussing what he told white house  chief of staff mark meadows
1GS2uybciaU,3226720,3231839,i remember  a call all  with
1GS2uybciaU,3231839,3238000,mr meadows  where mr meadows was asking me what i  was finding and if i was finding
1GS2uybciaU,3238000,3243760,anything  and i remember sharing with him that  we weren't finding anything
1GS2uybciaU,3243760,3249839,that would be  sufficient to  change the results in any of the key
1GS2uybciaU,3249839,3255680,states  when was that conversation  probably in november
1GS2uybciaU,3255680,3260800,mid to late november i think it was  before my child was born  and what was mr meadow's reaction to
1GS2uybciaU,3260800,3267680,that information  i believe the words he used were so  there's no there there
1GS2uybciaU,3267680,3274880,there's no there there  the trump campaign's general counsel  matt morgan gave similar testimony
1GS2uybciaU,3274880,3282240,he explained that all of the fraud  allegations and the campaign's other  election arguments taken together
1GS2uybciaU,3282240,3289839,and viewed in the best possible light  for president trump could still not  change the outcome of the election
1GS2uybciaU,3289839,3297200,president trump's attorney general bill  barr also told donald trump his election  claims were wrong
1GS2uybciaU,3299760,3305200,repeatedly  told the president in no uncertain terms
1GS2uybciaU,3305200,3310960,that  i did not see evidence of fraud
1GS2uybciaU,3310960,3316079,and you know that would have affected  the outcome of the election
1GS2uybciaU,3316079,3323280,and frankly a year and a half later i  haven't seen anything to change my mind  on that
1GS2uybciaU,3323520,3330079,attorney general barr also told  president trump that his allegations  about dominion voting machines were
1GS2uybciaU,3330079,3337280,groundless  i saw absolutely zero basis for the
1GS2uybciaU,3337280,3344000,allegations  but they were made in such a sensational  way  that they obviously were influencing a
1GS2uybciaU,3344000,3349680,lot of people  members of the public  that there was this systemic
1GS2uybciaU,3349680,3355119,corruption in the system and that their  votes didn't count and that these  machines controlled by somebody else
1GS2uybciaU,3355119,3360480,were actually determining it which was  complete nonsense  and it was being laid out there and i
1GS2uybciaU,3360480,3365680,told them that it was that it was uh  crazy stuff and they were wasting their
1GS2uybciaU,3365680,3372079,time on that  and  was doing a great grave disservice to  the country
1GS2uybciaU,3372079,3377359,but president trump persisted repeating  the false dominion allegations in public
1GS2uybciaU,3377359,3382480,at least a dozen more times even after  his attorney general told him they were
1GS2uybciaU,3382480,3387520,quote complete nonsense  and after barr's resignation on december
1GS2uybciaU,3387520,3392640,23rd the acting attorney general who  replaced him jeff rosen and the acting
1GS2uybciaU,3392640,3398240,deputy richard donahue told president  trump over and over again that the
1GS2uybciaU,3398240,3404319,evidence did not support allegations he  was making in public  many of president trump's white house
1GS2uybciaU,3404319,3410319,staff also recognized that the evidence  did not support the claims president  trump was making
1GS2uybciaU,3410319,3417440,this is the president's daughter  commenting on bill barr's statement that  the department found no fraud sufficient
1GS2uybciaU,3417440,3420960,to overturn the election
1GS2uybciaU,3422720,3429760,how did that affect your perspective  about the election when attorney general  barr made that statement  it affected my perspective
1GS2uybciaU,3429760,3435920,i respect attorney general bar  so i
1GS2uybciaU,3436079,3441520,accepted what he said was saying  as you will hear on monday the president
1GS2uybciaU,3441520,3449040,had every right to litigate his campaign  claims but he ultimately lost more than  60 cases in state and federal courts
1GS2uybciaU,3449040,3455599,the president's claims in the election  cases were so frivolous and unsupported  that the president's lead lawyer rudy
1GS2uybciaU,3455599,3461760,giuliani not only lost the lawsuits his  license to practice law was suspended
1GS2uybciaU,3461760,3466799,here's what the court said of mr  giuliani  giuliani
1GS2uybciaU,3466799,3474400,communicated demonstrably false and  misleading statements to courts  lawmakers and the public at large in his
1GS2uybciaU,3474400,3479680,capacity as lawyer for former president  donald j trump and the trump campaign in
1GS2uybciaU,3479680,3484720,connection with trump's failed effort at  reelection in 2020
1GS2uybciaU,3484720,3490079,as you will see in great detail in our  hearings president trump ignored the
1GS2uybciaU,3490079,3496799,rulings of our nation's courts  he ignored his own campaign leadership  his white house staff
1GS2uybciaU,3496799,3503680,many republican state officials he  ignored the department of justice and  the department of homeland security
1GS2uybciaU,3503680,3510559,president trump invested millions of  dollars of campaign funds purposely  spreading false information
1GS2uybciaU,3510559,3515920,running ads he knew were false  and convincing millions of americans
1GS2uybciaU,3515920,3522720,that the election was corrupt and that  he was the true president  as you will see this misinformation
1GS2uybciaU,3522720,3530480,campaign provoked the violence on  january 6th  in our third hearing you will see that
1GS2uybciaU,3530480,3536640,president trump corruptly planned to  replace the attorney general of the  united states
1GS2uybciaU,3536640,3542480,so the u.s justice department would  spread his false stolen election claims
1GS2uybciaU,3542480,3549040,in the days before january 6th president  trump told his top justice department  officials quote
1GS2uybciaU,3549040,3555599,just say the election was corrupt and  leave the rest to me and the republican  congressman
1GS2uybciaU,3555599,3561920,senior justice department officials men  he had appointed  told him they could not do that because
1GS2uybciaU,3561920,3567119,it was not true  so president trump decided to replace  them
1GS2uybciaU,3567119,3574000,he offered jeff clark an environmental  lawyer at the justice department the job  of acting attorney general
1GS2uybciaU,3574000,3580880,president trump wanted mr clark to take  a number of steps  including sending this letter to georgia
1GS2uybciaU,3580880,3588559,and five other states  saying the u.s department of justice had  quote  identified significant concerns that may
1GS2uybciaU,3588559,3594960,have impacted the outcome of the  election  this letter is a lie
1GS2uybciaU,3594960,3601599,the department of justice had in fact  repeatedly told president trump exactly  the opposite that they had investigated
1GS2uybciaU,3601599,3608480,his stolen election allegations and  found no credible fraud that could  impact the outcome of the election
1GS2uybciaU,3608480,3614960,this letter and others like it would  have urged multiple states  to withdraw their official and lawful
1GS2uybciaU,3614960,3622400,electoral votes for biden  acting deputy attorney general richard  donahue described jeff clark's letter
1GS2uybciaU,3622400,3628079,this way quote  this would be a grave step for the  department to take and could have
1GS2uybciaU,3628079,3634160,tremendous constitutional political and  social ramifications for this country
1GS2uybciaU,3634160,3639280,the committee agrees with mr donohue's  assessment  had clarke assumed the role of attorney
1GS2uybciaU,3639280,3644480,general in the days before january 6 and  issued these letters the ramifications
1GS2uybciaU,3644480,3649599,could indeed have been grave  mr donohue also said this about clark's
1GS2uybciaU,3649599,3655839,plan  and i recall toward the end saying what
1GS2uybciaU,3655839,3663119,you're proposing is nothing less than  the united states justice department  meddling in the outcome of a  presidential election
1GS2uybciaU,3663119,3668400,in our hearings you will hear firsthand  how the senior leadership of the  department of justice threatened to
1GS2uybciaU,3668400,3673520,resign  how the white house counsel threatened  to resign and how they confronted donald
1GS2uybciaU,3673520,3680799,trump and jeff clark in the oval office  the men involved including acting  attorney general jeff rosen and acting
1GS2uybciaU,3680799,3687760,deputy attorney general richard donahue  were appointed by president trump these  men honored their oaths of office they
1GS2uybciaU,3687760,3694319,did their duty and you will hear from  them in our hearings  by contrast jeff clark has invoked his
1GS2uybciaU,3694319,3699680,fifth amendment privilege against  self-incrimination and refused to  testify
1GS2uybciaU,3699680,3706160,representative scott perry who was also  involved in trying to get clark  appointed as attorney general has
1GS2uybciaU,3706160,3712079,refused to testify here  as you will see  representative perry contacted the white
1GS2uybciaU,3712079,3717599,house in the weeks after january 6  to seek a presidential pardon
1GS2uybciaU,3717599,3724720,multiple other republican congressmen  also sought presidential pardons for  their roles in attempting to overturn
1GS2uybciaU,3724720,3731119,the 2020 election  in our fourth hearing we will focus on  president trump's efforts to pressure
1GS2uybciaU,3731119,3736799,vice president mike pence to refuse to  count electoral votes on january 6.
1GS2uybciaU,3736799,3741838,vice president pence has spoken publicly  about this
1GS2uybciaU,3743280,3750480,president trump is wrong  i had no right to overturn the election  the presidency belongs to the american
1GS2uybciaU,3750480,3755680,people and the american people alone  and frankly there is no idea more on
1GS2uybciaU,3755680,3761599,america  than the notion that any one person  could choose the american president
1GS2uybciaU,3761599,3767039,what president trump demanded that mike  pence do wasn't just wrong  it was illegal and it was
1GS2uybciaU,3767039,3772480,unconstitutional  you will hear this in great detail from  the vice president's former general
1GS2uybciaU,3772480,3778400,counsel  witnesses in these hearings will explain  how the former vice president and his
1GS2uybciaU,3778400,3784400,staff informed president trump over and  over again that what he was pressuring
1GS2uybciaU,3784400,3790079,mike pence to do was illegal  as you will hear president trump engaged
1GS2uybciaU,3790079,3795200,in a relentless effort to pressure pence  both in private and in public
1GS2uybciaU,3795200,3801440,you will see the evidence of that  pressure from multiple witnesses live  and on video
1GS2uybciaU,3801440,3808000,vice president pence demonstrated his  loyalty to donald trump consistently  over four years
1GS2uybciaU,3808000,3815119,but he knew that he had a higher duty to  the united states constitution  this is testimony from the vice
1GS2uybciaU,3815119,3818400,president's chief of staff
1GS2uybciaU,3820880,3827200,so i think the vice president was proud  of his four years of service and he felt  like a much had been accomplished in
1GS2uybciaU,3827200,3832799,those four years and i think he was  proud to have stood beside the president  for all that had been done but i think
1GS2uybciaU,3832799,3839520,he ultimately knew that his fidelity the  constitution was his first and foremost  oath and um and that's that's what he
1GS2uybciaU,3839520,3844960,articulated publicly and i think that  that's what he felt  his fidelity to the constitution was
1GS2uybciaU,3844960,3850880,more important than his fidelity to  president trump and his desire both he  took  yes
1GS2uybciaU,3850880,3856400,you'll also hear about a lawyer named  john eastman  mr eastman was deeply involved in
1GS2uybciaU,3856400,3862400,president trump's plans  you'll hear from former 4th circuit  federal judge michael luedig a highly
1GS2uybciaU,3862400,3868000,respected leading conservative judge  john eastman clerked for judge ludwig
1GS2uybciaU,3868000,3873440,judge ludig provided counsel to the vice  president's team in the days before  january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,3873440,3880799,the judge will explain how eastman quote  was wrong at every turn  and you will see the email exchanges
1GS2uybciaU,3880799,3887280,between eastman and the vice president's  council as the violent attack on  congress was underway
1GS2uybciaU,3887280,3893599,mr jacob said this to me mr eastman  thanks to your we are under
1GS2uybciaU,3893599,3899039,siege  you will also see evidence that john  eastman did not actually believe the
1GS2uybciaU,3899039,3904480,legal position he was taking in fact a  month before the 2020 election eastman
1GS2uybciaU,3904480,3910400,took exactly the opposite view on the  same legal issues  in the course of the select committee's
1GS2uybciaU,3910400,3917359,work to obtain information from mr  eastman we have had occasion to present  evidence to a federal judge
1GS2uybciaU,3917359,3923599,the judge evaluated the facts and he  reached the conclusion that president  trump's efforts to pressure vice
1GS2uybciaU,3923599,3929039,president pence to act illegally by  refusing to count electoral votes
1GS2uybciaU,3929039,3934079,likely violated two federal criminal  statutes
1GS2uybciaU,3934079,3939839,and the judge also said this  if dr eastman and president trump's plan
1GS2uybciaU,3939839,3945359,had worked it would have permanently  ended the peaceful transition of power
1GS2uybciaU,3945359,3950880,undermining american democracy and the  constitution  if the country does not commit to
1GS2uybciaU,3950880,3958720,investigating and pursuing  accountability for those responsible the  court fears january 6 will repeat itself
1GS2uybciaU,3958720,3965119,every american should read what this  federal judge has written  the same judge judge carter issued
1GS2uybciaU,3965119,3970240,another decision on tuesday night just  this week indicating that john eastman
1GS2uybciaU,3970240,3976960,and other trump lawyers knew that their  legal arguments had no real chance of  success in court but they relied on
1GS2uybciaU,3976960,3982960,those arguments anyway  to try to quote overturn a democratic  election
1GS2uybciaU,3982960,3989920,and you will hear that while congress  was under attack on january 6 and the  hours following the violence the trump
1GS2uybciaU,3989920,3996000,legal team in the willard hotel war room  continued to work to halt the count of
1GS2uybciaU,3996000,4001760,electoral votes  in our fifth hearing you will see  evidence that president trump corruptly
1GS2uybciaU,4001760,4007119,pressured state legislators and election  officials to change election results
1GS2uybciaU,4007119,4013760,you will hear additional details about  president trump's call to georgia  officials urging them to quote find
1GS2uybciaU,4013760,4018799,eleven thousand seven hundred and eighty  votes  votes that did not exist
1GS2uybciaU,4018799,4023920,and his efforts to get states to rescind  certified electoral slates
1GS2uybciaU,4023920,4029599,without factual basis and contrary to  law  you will hear new details about the
1GS2uybciaU,4029599,4036640,trump campaign and other trump  associates efforts to instruct  republican officials in multiple states
1GS2uybciaU,4036640,4043760,to create intentionally false electoral  slates and transmit those slates to  congress to the vice president and the
1GS2uybciaU,4043760,4051359,national archives falsely certifying  that trump won states he actually lost
1GS2uybciaU,4051359,4059359,in our final two june hearings you will  hear how president trump summoned a  violent mob and directed them illegally
1GS2uybciaU,4059359,4066400,to march on the united states capital  while the violence was underway  president trump failed to take immediate
1GS2uybciaU,4066400,4072160,action to stop the violence and instruct  his supporters to leave the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,4072160,4077359,as we present these initial findings  keep two points in mind first
1GS2uybciaU,4077359,4084000,our investigation is still ongoing so  what we make public here will not be the  complete set of information we will
1GS2uybciaU,4084000,4090160,ultimately disclose  and second the department of justice is  currently working with cooperating
1GS2uybciaU,4090160,4095760,witnesses and has disclosed to date only  some of the information it is identified
1GS2uybciaU,4095760,4102000,from encrypted communications and other  sources  on december 18 2020
1GS2uybciaU,4102000,4107359,a group including general michael flynn  sydney powell rudy giuliani and others
1GS2uybciaU,4107359,4113600,visited the white house  they stayed late into the evening  we know that the group discussed a
1GS2uybciaU,4113600,4120640,number of dramatic steps  including having the military seized  voting machines and potentially re-run
1GS2uybciaU,4120640,4126318,elections  you will also hear that president trump  met with that group alone for a period
1GS2uybciaU,4126318,4134238,of time before white house lawyers and  other staff discovered the group was  there and rushed to intervene
1GS2uybciaU,4134238,4139679,a little more than an hour after ms  powell mr giuliani general flynn and the
1GS2uybciaU,4139679,4145440,others finally left the white house  president trump sent the tweet on the
1GS2uybciaU,4145440,4151278,screen now  telling people to come to washington on  january sixth
1GS2uybciaU,4151278,4157278,be there he instructed them  will be wild  as you will see this was a pivotal
1GS2uybciaU,4157278,4163838,moment this tweet  initiated a chain of events the tweet  led to the planning for what occurred on
1GS2uybciaU,4163838,4171600,january 6th including by the proud boys  who ultimately led the invasion of the  capitol and the violence on that day
1GS2uybciaU,4171600,4178880,the indictment of a group of proud boys  alleges that they planned quote to  oppose by force the authority of the
1GS2uybciaU,4178880,4184159,government of the united states  and according to the department of  justice
1GS2uybciaU,4184159,4191120,on january 6 2021 the defendants  directed mobilized and led members of
1GS2uybciaU,4191120,4196560,the crowd onto the capitol grounds and  into the capitol  leading to the dismantling of metal
1GS2uybciaU,4196560,4204159,barricades the destruction of property  the breaching of the capitol building  and the assaults on law enforcement
1GS2uybciaU,4204159,4210640,although certain former trump officials  have argued that they did not anticipate  violence on january 6 the evidence
1GS2uybciaU,4210640,4216239,suggests otherwise  as you will see in our hearings the  white house was receiving specific
1GS2uybciaU,4216239,4221600,reports in the days leading up to  january 6th including during president
1GS2uybciaU,4221600,4228159,trump's ellipse rally  indicating that elements in the crowd  were preparing for violence at the
1GS2uybciaU,4228159,4235360,capitol  and on the evening of january 5th the  president's close advisor steve bannon
1GS2uybciaU,4235360,4239040,said this on his podcast
1GS2uybciaU,4240480,4245840,all hell is going to break loose  tomorrow just understand this all hell
1GS2uybciaU,4245840,4252000,is going to break loose tomorrow  as part of our investigation we will  present information about what the white
1GS2uybciaU,4252000,4259600,house and other intelligence agencies  knew  and why the capital was not better  prepared but we will not lose sight of
1GS2uybciaU,4259600,4264800,the fact that the capitol police did not  cause the crowd to attack
1GS2uybciaU,4264800,4271280,and we will not blame the violence that  day  violence provoked by donald trump on the
1GS2uybciaU,4271280,4277440,officers who bravely defended all of us  in our final hearing you will hear a
1GS2uybciaU,4277440,4285120,moment by moment account of the  hours-long attack from more than half a  dozen white house staff both live in the
1GS2uybciaU,4285120,4290480,hearing room and via videotaped  testimony  there's no doubt that president trump
1GS2uybciaU,4290480,4298320,was well aware of the violence as it  developed  white house staff urged president trump  to intervene and call off the mob
1GS2uybciaU,4298320,4304400,here is a document written while the  attack was underway by a member of the  white house staff
1GS2uybciaU,4304400,4311280,advising what the president needed to  say  quote anyone who entered the capitol  without proper authority should leave
1GS2uybciaU,4311280,4316960,immediately  this is exactly what his supporters on  capitol hill and nationwide were urging
1GS2uybciaU,4316960,4322000,the president to do  he would not  you will hear that leaders on capitol
1GS2uybciaU,4322000,4327600,hill begged the president for help  including republican leader mccarthy who
1GS2uybciaU,4327600,4333679,was quote scared  and called multiple members of president  trump's family after he could not
1GS2uybciaU,4333679,4340880,persuade the president himself  not only did president trump refuse to  tell the mob to leave the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,4340880,4346400,he placed no call to any element of the  united states government to instruct
1GS2uybciaU,4346400,4353280,that the capital be defended  he did not call his secretary of defense  on january 6th he did not talk to his
1GS2uybciaU,4353280,4360239,attorney general he did not talk to the  department of homeland security  president trump gave no order to deploy
1GS2uybciaU,4360239,4366960,the national guard that day and he made  no effort to work with the department of  justice to coordinate and displa and
1GS2uybciaU,4366960,4372480,deploy law enforcement  assets but vice president pence did each
1GS2uybciaU,4372480,4379520,of those things  for example  here is what general milley the chairman  of the joint chiefs of staff testified
1GS2uybciaU,4379520,4385440,to this  committee there were two or three calls
1GS2uybciaU,4385440,4390719,with vice president pence he was very  animated and he issued very explicit
1GS2uybciaU,4390719,4396320,uh  very  direct unambiguous orders
1GS2uybciaU,4396320,4402960,there was no question about that and he  was and and i can get to the exact  quotes i guess from some of our records
1GS2uybciaU,4402960,4408000,somewhere but he was very animated very  direct very firm
1GS2uybciaU,4408000,4415840,uh and to secretary miller get the  military down and get the guard down  here put down this uh situation uh et
1GS2uybciaU,4415840,4421760,cetera  by contrast here is general milley's  description of his conversation with
1GS2uybciaU,4421760,4427840,president trump's chief of staff mark  meadows on january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,4429360,4436159,he said  we have we have to kill the narrative  that the vice president is making
1GS2uybciaU,4436159,4442400,all the decisions  we need to establish the narrative
1GS2uybciaU,4442400,4448880,that  um  you know that the president is still in  charge and that
1GS2uybciaU,4448880,4455280,things are steady or stable or what's  happening  i immediately interpret that as politics  politics politics
1GS2uybciaU,4455280,4461440,red flag for me personally no action but  i remember distinctly
1GS2uybciaU,4461679,4468000,and you will hear from witnesses how the  day played out inside the white house  how multiple white house staff resigned
1GS2uybciaU,4468000,4473199,and discussed and how president trump  would not ask his supporters to leave  the capitol
1GS2uybciaU,4473199,4479440,it was only after multiple hours of  violence that president trump finally  released a video
1GS2uybciaU,4479440,4485280,instructing the riotous mob to leave and  as he did so he said to them quote we
1GS2uybciaU,4485280,4491120,love you and you're very special  you will also hear that in the immediate
1GS2uybciaU,4491120,4496640,aftermath of january 6th members of the  president's family white house staff
1GS2uybciaU,4496640,4504239,and others  tried to step in to stabilize the  situation quote to land the plane before
1GS2uybciaU,4504239,4510000,the presidential transition on january  20th  you will hear about members of the trump
1GS2uybciaU,4510000,4516800,cabinet discussing the possibility of  invoking the 25th amendment and  replacing the president of the united
1GS2uybciaU,4516800,4522640,states  multiple members of president trump's  own cabinet resigned immediately after
1GS2uybciaU,4522640,4528960,january 6th  one member of the cabinet suggested that  the remaining cabinet officers needed to
1GS2uybciaU,4528960,4534400,take a more active role in running the  white house and the administration
1GS2uybciaU,4534400,4539760,but most emblematic of those days is  this exchange of texts between sean
1GS2uybciaU,4539760,4545760,hannity and former president  trump's press secretary kaylee mcinanny
1GS2uybciaU,4545760,4551600,sean hannity wrote in part  key now  no more crazy people
1GS2uybciaU,4551600,4557280,no more stolen election talk  yes impeachment and 25th amendment are
1GS2uybciaU,4557280,4564080,real  many people will quit  ms mcaney responded in part love that
1GS2uybciaU,4564080,4569120,that's the playbook the white house  staff knew that president trump was
1GS2uybciaU,4569120,4575600,willing to entertain and use conspiracy  theories to achieve his ends  they knew the president needed to be cut
1GS2uybciaU,4575600,4582000,off from all of those who had encouraged  him  they knew that president donald trump
1GS2uybciaU,4582000,4587600,was too dangerous to be left alone  at least until he left office on january
1GS2uybciaU,4587600,4593040,20th  these are important facts for congress  and the american people to understand
1GS2uybciaU,4593040,4598640,fully when a president fails to take the  steps necessary to preserve our union or
1GS2uybciaU,4598640,4604159,worse causes a constitutional crisis  we're at a moment of maximum danger for
1GS2uybciaU,4604159,4610800,our republic  some in the white house took responsible  steps to try to prevent january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,4610800,4616320,others egged the president on  others who could have acted refused to
1GS2uybciaU,4616320,4623920,do so  in this case the white house counsel was  so concerned about potentially lawless
1GS2uybciaU,4623920,4631040,activity that he threatened to resign  multiple times  that is exceedingly rare and exceedingly
1GS2uybciaU,4631040,4636880,serious  it requires immediate attention  especially when the entire team
1GS2uybciaU,4636880,4643840,threatens to resign  however in the trump white house it was  not exceedingly rare and it was not
1GS2uybciaU,4643840,4650400,treated seriously  this is a clip of jared kushner  addressing multiple threats
1GS2uybciaU,4650400,4655600,by white house counsel pat sipoloni and  his team of lawyers to resign in the
1GS2uybciaU,4655600,4659280,weeks before january 6.
1GS2uybciaU,4660640,4668159,jared  are you aware of um instances where  pat cipolloni threatened to resign
1GS2uybciaU,4668159,4673440,i kind of like i said my interest at  that time was on trying to get as many  pardons done
1GS2uybciaU,4673440,4679840,and i know that you know he was always  to him and the team were always saying  oh we're going to resign we're not going  to be here if this happens if that
1GS2uybciaU,4679840,4686000,happens so  i kind of took it up to just be whining  to be honest with you
1GS2uybciaU,4686239,4691440,whining  there's a reason why people serving in  our government take an oath to the
1GS2uybciaU,4691440,4696719,constitution  as our founding fathers recognize  democracy is fragile
1GS2uybciaU,4696719,4703840,people in positions of public trust are  duty-bound to defend it to step forward  when action is required
1GS2uybciaU,4703840,4710239,in our country we don't swear an oath to  an individual or a political party we  take our oath to defend the united
1GS2uybciaU,4710239,4717920,states constitution  and that oath must mean something  tonight i say this to my republican
1GS2uybciaU,4717920,4723520,colleagues who are defending the  indefensible  there will come a day when donald trump
1GS2uybciaU,4723520,4730560,is gone  but your dishonor will remain  finally i ask all of our fellow
1GS2uybciaU,4730560,4736480,americans as you watch our hearings over  the coming weeks please remember what's  at stake
1GS2uybciaU,4736480,4742560,remember the men and women who have  fought and died so that we can live  under the rule of law not the rule of
1GS2uybciaU,4742560,4748640,men  i ask you to think of the scene in our  capital rotunda on the night of january
1GS2uybciaU,4748640,4753840,6th  there in a sacred space in our  constitutional republic

1GS2uybciaU,4764400,4771760,against every wall that night encircling  the room there were swat teams  men and women in tactical gear with long
1GS2uybciaU,4771760,4777760,guns  deployed inside our capitol building  there in the rotunda these brave men and
1GS2uybciaU,4777760,4783520,women rested beneath paintings  depicting the earliest scenes of our  republic
1GS2uybciaU,4783520,4788880,including one painted in 1824  depicting george washington resigning
1GS2uybciaU,4788880,4795280,his commission  voluntarily relinquishing power  handing control of the continental army
1GS2uybciaU,4795280,4802080,back to congress  with this noble act washington set the  indispensable example of the peaceful
1GS2uybciaU,4802080,4807840,transfer of power  what president reagan called nothing  less than a miracle
1GS2uybciaU,4807840,4814800,the sacred obligation to defend this  peaceful transfer of power  has been honored by every american
1GS2uybciaU,4814800,4821360,president  except one  as americans we all have a duty to
1GS2uybciaU,4821360,4828560,ensure that what happened on january 6th  never happens again  to set aside partisan battles
1GS2uybciaU,4828560,4833920,to stand together to perpetuate and  preserve our great republic

1GS2uybciaU,5569199,5575280,pursuant to the order of the committee  of tonight  the chair declares the committee in
1GS2uybciaU,5575280,5581600,recess  for a period of approximately 10 minutes
1GS2uybciaU,5586800,5592560,and as you heard the committee now  taking that recess about 10 minutes the  estimation but there was a lot of
1GS2uybciaU,5592560,5598800,information here in that past hour as  the committee began to build their case  that former president trump was
1GS2uybciaU,5598800,5605520,responsible for the events of january 6.  first there was that dramatic newly  revealed video of the insurrection
1GS2uybciaU,5605520,5611600,underway  including an overhead angle showing  protesters storming the capitol and then
1GS2uybciaU,5611600,5618400,the violence played out on body cams and  other surveillance video they then made  their way up the steps and forced their
1GS2uybciaU,5618400,5623520,way inside  we should say let you know when that  video was played there were officers
1GS2uybciaU,5623520,5628840,inside the hearing room who were  watching and fighting back tears  sometimes
1GS2uybciaU,5628840,5635360,unsuccessfully next congresswoman liz  cheney presenting evidence that the  president was told repeatedly that he
1GS2uybciaU,5635360,5642320,lost the election but still continued to  say it was stolen she even played clips  from his inner circle including his
1GS2uybciaU,5642320,5647360,daughter and son-in-law testifying that  he was informed there was no fraud
1GS2uybciaU,5647360,5653199,and we heard from the chairman of the  joint chiefs at the time who testified  that while he heard from vice president
1GS2uybciaU,5653199,5659679,mike pence pleading for forces to be  sent in he never heard it from the  president our team is standing by to
1GS2uybciaU,5659679,5664960,break it all down during this break let  me first bring in our political director  and moderator of meet the press chuck
1GS2uybciaU,5664960,5672400,todd uh chuck as we noted at the  beginning of this this is not a criminal  proceeding  but there is a goal here among these
1GS2uybciaU,5672400,5678639,members of this committee have they  achieved it  well i think they're beginning they  certainly made it very powerful what i'd
1GS2uybciaU,5678639,5684000,call an opening statement if you will an  opening argument you know it struck me  lester you and i have
1GS2uybciaU,5684000,5689040,you and i have covered two impeachments  together of of then president trump
1GS2uybciaU,5689040,5696639,and in some ways this is the third  impeachment here  uh and  this is what happens when you get a year
1GS2uybciaU,5696639,5703360,to do investigations  uh and when you get his attorney general  on the record and you get his some of
1GS2uybciaU,5703360,5708560,his senior advisors on the record  as powerful as i think the jamie raskin
1GS2uybciaU,5708560,5714960,opening statement was and the second  impeachment that was essentially over  um the former president's role uh uh
1GS2uybciaU,5714960,5721520,right after january 6.  this is what happens when you get  another year of investigation you get
1GS2uybciaU,5721520,5728639,more of this evidence this takes what  was a powerful opening before  and i think brings it right to the
1GS2uybciaU,5728639,5735360,doorstep of the former president and i  think that's what made it and the other  thing that struck me about what they've  done so far both chairman thompson and
1GS2uybciaU,5735360,5741119,vice chair cheney is that they've been  they've been uh methodical about it
1GS2uybciaU,5741119,5748400,they've not been  they've not been  over charged about overheated they've
1GS2uybciaU,5748400,5754560,been stating the fact backing it up with  receipts i just think it's been a  powerful first hour and again if this
1GS2uybciaU,5754560,5761040,were if we were compared to the previous  actual impeachments that we've seen this  is easily the most powerful opening
1GS2uybciaU,5761040,5767119,we've had of the three and i think those  other two are pretty powerful  okay uh chuck as we stand by during this
1GS2uybciaU,5767119,5773440,period uh this break period let me turn  to washington uh senior washington  correspondent hallie jackson uh hallie
1GS2uybciaU,5773440,5779520,let me ask you about the this video we  saw a lot of these shots will seem  familiar to people but maybe from a
1GS2uybciaU,5779520,5785520,different angle uh so much to sort  through what struck you what should we  hone on in ho nina we've seen so much
1GS2uybciaU,5785520,5791840,footage at this point lester wright of  what happened on the day of the  insurrection we've seen it from people's  cell phone videos we've seen it from the
1GS2uybciaU,5791840,5798560,impeachment trials you and chuck were  just talking about the second  impeachment trial what was different  here these are some new angles right
1GS2uybciaU,5798560,5804080,some new perspectives of what happened  some of those higher angle shots for  example showing the rioters filling the
1GS2uybciaU,5804080,5810480,area outside the capitol before storming  the building you had the new audio in  some instances of what these officers
1GS2uybciaU,5810480,5816480,who were trying to defend the capital  were going to it just doesn't get any  easier to watch right and that i think
1GS2uybciaU,5816480,5822719,is what is is part and parcel of what  the committee wanted to get across now  there was that decision to show video of
1GS2uybciaU,5822719,5828960,not just house speaker nancy pelosi's  office but top house republican kevin  mccarthy's office too
1GS2uybciaU,5828960,5835119,and what was happening there that day  and then you had some new images too and  some audio from a documentarian
1GS2uybciaU,5835119,5840239,filmmaker a british guy named nick  quested you're actually going to hear  from him directly he's one of the  witnesses we'll hear from after the
1GS2uybciaU,5840239,5846400,break who was essentially filming the  proud boys so that's some of the footage  that is looks a little bit different
1GS2uybciaU,5846400,5853199,from some of the cell phone video that  you may have seen we heard from some of  the people there  somebody saying i'll lay down my life if
1GS2uybciaU,5853199,5858719,that would that's what it takes for  example so in some ways you're right  lester this is overall
1GS2uybciaU,5858719,5866480,somewhat familiar because we have seen  images like these before  but again it just doesn't get easier
1GS2uybciaU,5866480,5872400,hallie let me ask you about some of the  witness clips that were shown these uh  many of them were trump insiders his
1GS2uybciaU,5872400,5879119,daughter ivanka his former attorney  general how powerful was that how much  of that will we be seeing going forward
1GS2uybciaU,5879119,5885600,these are trump insiders right i mean to  the very level of ivanka trump and jared  kushner members of his family and by the
1GS2uybciaU,5885600,5891360,way official members of the white house  as senior advisors for example his  former attorney general bill barr jason
1GS2uybciaU,5891360,5896960,miller a top trump campaign advisor and  what was interesting here is first you
1GS2uybciaU,5896960,5904080,saw the committee cast this and this is  an important part of their argument here  as  trump insiders knowing they say that the
1GS2uybciaU,5904080,5911040,election fraud claims they were making  were not true knowing that in november  months before the january 6 insurrection
1GS2uybciaU,5911040,5916560,weeks before the insurrection happened  you also had the attorney general at the  time bill barr
1GS2uybciaU,5916560,5922080,explaining and he said this publicly  lester he said this to you explaining  how he very directly said to former
1GS2uybciaU,5922080,5928080,president trump no these claims are not  true i want to play a little bit of what  the former ag said and then
1GS2uybciaU,5928080,5935199,how the former president's daughter  ivanka trump  reacted to that how she was asked about  that watch
1GS2uybciaU,5937119,5942880,i repeatedly  told the president no uncertain terms
1GS2uybciaU,5942880,5948719,that  i did not see evidence of fraud
1GS2uybciaU,5948719,5953760,and you know that would have affected  the outcome of the election
1GS2uybciaU,5953760,5960480,and frankly a year and a half later i  haven't seen anything to to change my  mind on that
1GS2uybciaU,5960480,5967520,how did that affect your perspective  about the election when attorney general  barr made that statement  it affected my perspective
1GS2uybciaU,5967520,5973679,i respect attorney general barr  so i
1GS2uybciaU,5973760,5979600,accepted what he said was saying  so that's the former president's  daughter acknowledging and accepting
1GS2uybciaU,5979600,5985440,that there was no widespread election  fraud despite the the election lies  essentially that her father then sought
1GS2uybciaU,5985440,5991040,to promote it is worth noting though  that while ivanka trump said that to the  january 6 select committee it has been
1GS2uybciaU,5991040,5997199,reported that she privately uh was was  attempting to push back on some of the  claims being made she still appeared
1GS2uybciaU,5997199,6003280,with her father at a rally in georgia  two days before the insurrection lester  all right hallie thanks very much again

1GS2uybciaU,6668320,6675360,mall  and observed a large contingent of proud  boys marching towards the capital  we filmed them
1GS2uybciaU,6675360,6682639,and almost immediately i was separated  from my colleagues  i documented the crowd turned from  protesters to writers to
1GS2uybciaU,6682639,6688719,insurrectionists  i was surprised at the size of the group  the anger and the profanity
1GS2uybciaU,6688719,6694560,and for anyone who didn't understand how  violent that event  was i
1GS2uybciaU,6694560,6701920,saw it i documented it and i experienced  it  i heard incredibly aggressive chanting
1GS2uybciaU,6701920,6709040,and i shared subsequently shared that  footage with the authorities  i'm here today s  pursuant to a house subpoena thank you
1GS2uybciaU,6709040,6714800,so much  thank you mr quested  the select committee has conducted
1GS2uybciaU,6714800,6720080,extensive investigative work to  understand what led the proud boys and
1GS2uybciaU,6720080,6727440,other rioters to the capitol on january  6th  we've obtained substantial evidence
1GS2uybciaU,6727440,6735520,showing that the president's december  19th tweet  calling his followers to washington d.c
1GS2uybciaU,6735520,6742000,on january 6th  energized  individuals from the proud boys and
1GS2uybciaU,6742000,6751480,others extremist groups  i'd like to play a brief video  highlighting some of this evidence
1GS2uybciaU,6752560,6758239,my name is marcus childress and i'm an  investigative counsel for the select  committee to investigate the january 6
1GS2uybciaU,6758239,6764920,attack on the united states capitol what  do you want to call them give me your  name give me surprise
1GS2uybciaU,6766239,6772480,stand back and stand by  after he made this comment enrique  terrio then chairman of the proud boys
1GS2uybciaU,6772480,6778080,said on parlor standing by sir  during our investigation we learned that  this comment during the presidential
1GS2uybciaU,6778080,6784800,debate actually led to an increase in  membership from the proud boys would you  say that proud boys numbers increased
1GS2uybciaU,6784800,6789840,after the stand back standby comment  exponentially i'd say
1GS2uybciaU,6789840,6796080,tripled probably with the potential for  a lot more eventually and did you ever  sell any stand back and stand by
1GS2uybciaU,6796080,6803599,merchandise  uh  one of the vendors on my page actually  beat me to it but i wish i would have i
1GS2uybciaU,6803599,6810320,wish i would have made a stand back  standby shirt on december 19th president  trump tweeted about the january 6 rally
1GS2uybciaU,6810320,6816400,and told attendees be there will be wild  many of the witnesses that we  interviewed were inspired by the
1GS2uybciaU,6816400,6823520,president's call and came to d.c for  january 6. but the extremists they took  it a step further they viewed this tweet
1GS2uybciaU,6823520,6829199,as a call to arms a day later the  department of justice describes how the  proud boys created a chat called the
1GS2uybciaU,6829199,6836239,ministry of self-defense leadership chat  in this chat the proud boys established  a command structure in anticipation of
1GS2uybciaU,6836239,6841840,coming back to dc on january 6. the  department of justice describes mr  tarrio coming into possession of a
1GS2uybciaU,6841840,6848560,document called the 1776 returns which  describes  individuals occupying key buildings
1GS2uybciaU,6848560,6854159,around the united states capital the  oath keepers are another group that the  committee investigated you better get
1GS2uybciaU,6854159,6859440,your ass to d.c folks this saturday  yeah if you don't there'll be no more  republic but we're not going to let that
1GS2uybciaU,6859440,6866800,happen it's not even if  it's either president trump is  encouraged and bolstered strengthened to  do what he must do or we wind up in a
1GS2uybciaU,6866800,6872400,bloody fight we all know that the  fight's coming the oath keepers began  planning to block the peaceful transfer
1GS2uybciaU,6872400,6877599,of power shortly after november 3rd  election and according to the department  of justice stuart rhodes the oath
1GS2uybciaU,6877599,6883840,keeper's leader said to his followers  that we were not going to get through  this without the civil war in response
1GS2uybciaU,6883840,6891040,to the december 19 2020 tweet by  president trump the oath keepers focused  on january 6 in washington dc
1GS2uybciaU,6891040,6896880,in response to the tweet one member the  president of the florida chapter put on  social media the president called us to
1GS2uybciaU,6896880,6902080,the capitol he wants us to make it wild  the goal was for the oath keepers to be  called to duty so that they could keep
1GS2uybciaU,6902080,6907440,the president in power although  president trump had just lost the  election the committee learned that the
1GS2uybciaU,6907440,6914400,oath keepers set up quick reaction  forces outside of the city in virginia  where they stored arms the goal of these
1GS2uybciaU,6914400,6920400,quick reaction forces was to be on  standby just in case president trump  invoked the insurrection act did vote
1GS2uybciaU,6920400,6926320,keepers ever provide weapons to members  i'm going to decline to answer that and  put them in grounds
1GS2uybciaU,6926320,6931760,for  due process trials in footage obtained  by the committee we learned that on the
1GS2uybciaU,6931760,6937280,night of january 5th enrique tario and  stuart rhodes met in a parking garage in
1GS2uybciaU,6937280,6942400,washington d.c there's mutual respect  there  i think we're
1GS2uybciaU,6942400,6948960,we're fighting the same fight and i  think that's what's important  the committee learned that the oath  keepers went into the capital through
1GS2uybciaU,6948960,6954320,the east doors and two stack formations  the doj alleges that one of the stacks
1GS2uybciaU,6954320,6960560,went into the capital looking for  speaker pelosi although they never found  her as the attack was unfolding mr tario
1GS2uybciaU,6960560,6967599,took credit and documents obtained by  the department of justice mr tario said  in an encrypted chat made no mistake and
1GS2uybciaU,6967599,6973440,we did this  later on that evening mr tario even
1GS2uybciaU,6973440,6979679,posted a video which seemed to resemble  him in front of the capitol with a black  cape and the title of the video was
1GS2uybciaU,6979679,6986400,premonition  the evidence developed by the select  committee and the department of justice  highlights how each group participated
1GS2uybciaU,6986400,6991440,on the attack on the capitol on january  6. in fact the investigation revealed
1GS2uybciaU,6991440,6997599,that it was individuals associated with  the proud boys who instigated the  initial breach at the peace circle at 12
1GS2uybciaU,6997599,7001159,53 pm
1GS2uybciaU,7003520,7008880,within 10 minutes riders had already  filled the lower west plaza
1GS2uybciaU,7010000,7018159,by 2 o'clock rioters had reached the  doors on the west and the east  plazas and by 213 rioters had actually
1GS2uybciaU,7018159,7023280,broken through the senate wing door and  got into the capitol building
1GS2uybciaU,7024400,7030480,a series of breaches followed  at 2 25 pm rioters reached the east side
1GS2uybciaU,7030480,7033599,doors to the rotunda
1GS2uybciaU,7036639,7043960,and then right after 2 40 pm riders  breached the east side doors near the  ways and means room
1GS2uybciaU,7044159,7049280,once the rioters infiltrated the capital  they moved through the crypt  [Applause]
1GS2uybciaU,7049280,7057030,the rotunda  the hallways leading to the house  chambers  and even inside the senate chambers
1GS2uybciaU,7057030,7061130,[Applause]
1GS2uybciaU,7063199,7068239,individuals associated with two violent  extremist groups have been charged with
1GS2uybciaU,7068239,7073599,seditious conspiracy in connection with  the january sixth attack
1GS2uybciaU,7073599,7079840,one is the oath keepers  they are a group of armed  anti-government extremists
1GS2uybciaU,7079840,7085760,the other group is the proud boys  they promote white supremist beliefs and
1GS2uybciaU,7085760,7092159,have engaged in violence with people  they view as their political enemies
1GS2uybciaU,7092159,7097760,members of both groups have already pled  guilty to crimes associated with the
1GS2uybciaU,7097760,7104000,january 6 attack  mr quested as part of the documentary
1GS2uybciaU,7104000,7109840,you've been filming you gain access to  the proud boys and their leader enrique
1GS2uybciaU,7109840,7117280,tario  your crew filmed them in washington d.c  on the evening of january 5th and then
1GS2uybciaU,7117280,7122800,on january 6th  on january 5th the night before the  attack
1GS2uybciaU,7122800,7128960,you were with the head of the proud boys  mr tario in washington d.c
1GS2uybciaU,7128960,7136719,what happened  we picked up mr tario from jail
1GS2uybciaU,7136719,7144719,he'd  been arrested for  carrying  some magazines uh some long some extra
1GS2uybciaU,7144719,7149760,capacity magazines and  for the he took responsibility for the
1GS2uybciaU,7149760,7155280,burning of the  black lives matter flag that was stolen  from the church
1GS2uybciaU,7155280,7161679,um on december the 12th  we  um we were attempting to get an
1GS2uybciaU,7161679,7169199,interview with mr tario  we had no idea of any of the events that  were going to subsequently happen
1GS2uybciaU,7169199,7176800,um  we drove him to pick up his bags from  the property department of the police
1GS2uybciaU,7176800,7183920,which is just south of the mall  we picked up his bags and went to get  some other bags from the phoenix hotel
1GS2uybciaU,7183920,7189040,where we  encountered mr stewart roads
1GS2uybciaU,7189040,7192080,from the oath keepers
1GS2uybciaU,7194159,7201280,by the time i'd gone to park the car my  colleague was saying who'd got into the  car with mr terrio that they had moved
1GS2uybciaU,7201280,7207520,to a  location around the corner the parking  garage of the
1GS2uybciaU,7207520,7213280,hall of legends i believe  and um so we quickly drove over there we
1GS2uybciaU,7213280,7219920,drove down into the parking garage  and filmed the scene of mr tario and mr
1GS2uybciaU,7219920,7228159,rhodes uh and certain other individuals  in that garage um
1GS2uybciaU,7228159,7234719,we then continued to follow mrtario  there was some discussion about where he  was going to go he ended up going
1GS2uybciaU,7234719,7240000,towards a hotel in baltimore and we  conducted an interview with him in the
1GS2uybciaU,7240000,7246400,hotel room  and then we returned to dc for that  night
1GS2uybciaU,7246400,7254560,in a  and what was interesting that night  actually was that was the first  indication that dc was much more busy
1GS2uybciaU,7254560,7260080,than it had been any other time we'd  been here because we couldn't get into  the hotels we wanted to
1GS2uybciaU,7260080,7265840,and we  um  ended up at a hotel that you know was
1GS2uybciaU,7265840,7269840,not as satisfactory as we would hoped
1GS2uybciaU,7271920,7277679,thank you so  what you're saying is you
1GS2uybciaU,7277920,7284000,filmed the meeting between mr tario and  oathkeeper's leader stewart rose right
1GS2uybciaU,7284000,7289199,indeed  you couldn't hear what was said but  according to the justice department
1GS2uybciaU,7289199,7295360,indictment of mr tario  a participant referenced the capital
1GS2uybciaU,7295360,7303040,now on the morning of january 6th you  learned the proud boys would gather near  the rallies scheduled to take place near
1GS2uybciaU,7303040,7309599,the white house  what time did you meet up with the proud  boys and what was happening when they
1GS2uybciaU,7309599,7316719,met  um we met up with the proud boys uh  somewhere around 10 30 a.m and they were
1GS2uybciaU,7316719,7324560,starting to walk  down the mile  uh  easterly direction towards the capital
1GS2uybciaU,7324560,7329760,um  there was a  a large contingent more than i had
1GS2uybciaU,7329760,7336159,expected  and i was  confused to a certain extent why we were  walking away from the president's speech
1GS2uybciaU,7336159,7341679,because that's what um  i felt we were there to cover
1GS2uybciaU,7341679,7348480,so at 10 30 a.m  uh that's early in the day that's even  before president trump had started
1GS2uybciaU,7348480,7353599,speaking am i correct yes  sir so how many proud boys would you
1GS2uybciaU,7353599,7360880,estimate were marching together  to the capitol  um a couple of hundred
1GS2uybciaU,7360880,7366960,potentially yeah i say a couple of  hundred proud boys were marching towards  the capital at that point at the time
1GS2uybciaU,7366960,7373679,was the area heavily guarded  no that was  we meant i remember we walked past the
1GS2uybciaU,7373679,7380960,we walked down the mall we walked to the  right of the reflecting pool and then  north along the road that leads to the
1GS2uybciaU,7380960,7386480,peace circle and as we were walking past  the peace circle i framed the proud boys
1GS2uybciaU,7386480,7392400,to the right of my shot with the capital  behind and we see one sole police
1GS2uybciaU,7392400,7397599,officer  um at the barriers which are  subsequently breached
1GS2uybciaU,7397599,7403599,we then walk up and passed a  um tactical unit preparing
1GS2uybciaU,7403599,7410719,and there's you see that in the film  where the man questions their duty and  their honor and you see
1GS2uybciaU,7410719,7417840,maybe a dozen  um  uh capitol police um putting on their  riot gear
1GS2uybciaU,7417840,7423119,so  how would you describe the atmosphere at  that
1GS2uybciaU,7423119,7431360,that time  the atmosphere was it seemed to be much  darker i i make efforts to create
1GS2uybciaU,7431360,7436880,a familiarity between myself and my  subjects to you know make them feel  comfortable
1GS2uybciaU,7436880,7443760,and um  the the atmosphere was much darker than  at this day than than had been in these
1GS2uybciaU,7443760,7449119,other in these other in these other days  and there was also a contingent of proud
1GS2uybciaU,7449119,7456000,boys that i hadn't met before from  arizona who appeared to wear these  orange hats
1GS2uybciaU,7456400,7462000,and had orange armbands  so when the proud boys went back down
1GS2uybciaU,7462000,7467119,the hill to the peace circle did a  larger crowd start together
1GS2uybciaU,7467119,7473280,well no first of all we went round to  the back and down the steps and we took  some photographs on the east side of the
1GS2uybciaU,7473280,7479560,capitol  and then we went for lunch we went for  tuckers
1GS2uybciaU,7479760,7485119,so mr question you're a journalist  so you are careful to stick to things
1GS2uybciaU,7485119,7490400,that you have observed  but what you've told us
1GS2uybciaU,7490400,7495440,is highly relevant  let me highlight a few key facts that
1GS2uybciaU,7495440,7500960,you and others have provided the  committee  first there was a large group of proud
1GS2uybciaU,7500960,7506400,boys present at the capitol  we know that from multiple sources
1GS2uybciaU,7506400,7513679,you now estimate that there were around  250  uh to 300 individuals that you've
1GS2uybciaU,7513679,7521440,testified  they weren't there for president trump's  speech  we know this because they left that area
1GS2uybciaU,7521440,7527280,to march toward the capitol before the  speech began  they walked around the capitol that
1GS2uybciaU,7527280,7534079,morning  i'm concerned this allowed them to see  what defenses were in place and where
1GS2uybciaU,7534079,7539599,weaknesses might be  and they decided to launch their attack
1GS2uybciaU,7539599,7545920,at the peace peace circle  which is a front door of the capitol  complex
1GS2uybciaU,7545920,7551920,it's the first security perimeter  that those marching from the ellipse
1GS2uybciaU,7551920,7558960,would have to come to  as they moved toward the capitol  the peace circle walk away
1GS2uybciaU,7558960,7566079,was  walkway  was always where the thousands of angry  trump supporters would arrive after
1GS2uybciaU,7566079,7571520,president trump  sent them  from the lips
1GS2uybciaU,7571520,7577599,the proud boys timed their attack to the  moments before the start of the joint  session
1GS2uybciaU,7577599,7583679,in the capitol which is also where  president trump directed the angry ma
1GS2uybciaU,7583679,7590400,quote we fight like hell end quote he  told them before sending them
1GS2uybciaU,7590400,7595840,down pennsylvania avenue right to where  the proud boys gathered and where you
1GS2uybciaU,7595840,7602719,were filming  now central question is whether the  attack on the capitol was coordinated
1GS2uybciaU,7602719,7609360,and planned  what you witnessed is what a coordinated  and planned effort would look like
1GS2uybciaU,7609360,7614719,it was the culmination of  a months-long effort spearheaded by
1GS2uybciaU,7614719,7621040,president trump  mr question thank you for your  eyewitness account
1GS2uybciaU,7621040,7627280,of the lead up to the breach of the  priest circle  this brings us to a point in time where
1GS2uybciaU,7627280,7632320,you  and officer edwards were in close  proximity
1GS2uybciaU,7632320,7638400,at this point  i reserved a balance of my time pursuant  to 5c

1GS2uybciaU,7678639,7683920,short clip  that  shows  the horrible moment when you were

1GS2uybciaU,7741440,7750320,walkway or right by peace circle there  was another bike rack and so  the crowd had kind of gathered there
1GS2uybciaU,7750320,7755440,it was the crowd led by  joseph biggs
1GS2uybciaU,7755440,7762480,and they were mostly in civilian clothes  there were some  who had military fatigues
1GS2uybciaU,7762480,7768960,on  we could see  people with  bulletproof vests on you know things
1GS2uybciaU,7768960,7775040,like that  they didn't seem you know  extremely cohesive but they had gathered
1GS2uybciaU,7775040,7781840,there in their outfits  but they had gathered there  together and
1GS2uybciaU,7781840,7786960,joseph biggs started  he had a micro or a megaphone and he
1GS2uybciaU,7786960,7793280,started talking about  you know first it was  things kind of
1GS2uybciaU,7793280,7799599,relating to congress  and then  the
1GS2uybciaU,7799599,7805920,table started turning  once  the  what is now that the arizona group is
1GS2uybciaU,7805920,7811360,what you said  the crowd with orange hats  they came up chanting
1GS2uybciaU,7811360,7819840,[Music]   antifa  um and they joined that group and once
1GS2uybciaU,7819840,7824880,they joined that group  joseph biggs
1GS2uybciaU,7824880,7830480,rhetoric turned to  the capitol police
1GS2uybciaU,7830480,7836000,he started asking us questions like  you've you didn't miss a paycheck during
1GS2uybciaU,7836000,7843840,the pandemic  um mentioning stuff about our pay scale  was mentioned
1GS2uybciaU,7844079,7849119,and  you know started turning the tables on  us
1GS2uybciaU,7849119,7854639,and  i've worked  i can
1GS2uybciaU,7854639,7861840,you know conservatively say probably  hundreds  of  civil disturbance events i know when i'm
1GS2uybciaU,7861840,7867360,being turned into a villain and that's  when i turned to my sergeant and i
1GS2uybciaU,7867360,7873599,stated the  understatement of the century i said  sarge  i think we're going to need a few more
1GS2uybciaU,7873599,7880560,people down here  and  so after that
1GS2uybciaU,7880560,7885840,you know  i think they started conferring they  went a little silent they started
1GS2uybciaU,7885840,7891520,conferring among  each other  i saw
1GS2uybciaU,7891920,7899280,the person now identified as ryan samsel  he put his arm  around joseph begs and they were talking
1GS2uybciaU,7899280,7905520,and then they started approaching the  first barricade they ripped the first  barricade down
1GS2uybciaU,7905520,7911360,and they approached  our  bike racks
1GS2uybciaU,7911360,7917040,um  you know at that time  [Music]  we
1GS2uybciaU,7917040,7922079,started  holding on grabbing the bike racks
1GS2uybciaU,7922079,7927599,you know there weren't many of us so i  grabbed  the middle between two different bike
1GS2uybciaU,7927599,7934159,racks  and  you know i wasn't under any pretense  that i could hold it for very long but i
1GS2uybciaU,7934159,7942159,just wanted to you know make sure that  we could get more people down and  get our cdu units time to to answer the
1GS2uybciaU,7942159,7947840,call so  we started grappling over the bike racks
1GS2uybciaU,7947840,7954480,i felt  the bike rack  come on top of my head
1GS2uybciaU,7954480,7960639,and i was pushed backwards  and my foot caught the stair behind me
1GS2uybciaU,7960639,7968719,and i  my chin hit the handrail and then i at  that point i had blacked out but my
1GS2uybciaU,7968719,7974800,the back of my head clipped  the concrete stairs behind me
1GS2uybciaU,7974960,7980079,and you were knocked unconscious is that  right officer edwards yes ma'am
1GS2uybciaU,7980079,7985599,but then when you regained consciousness  even with the injuries you returned to  duty is that right
1GS2uybciaU,7985599,7993280,yes ma'am um  you know at that time adrenaline kicked  in  i ran towards the west front and i tried
1GS2uybciaU,7993280,7998320,to hold the line at the senate steps
1GS2uybciaU,7998320,8005599,at the lower west terrace  more people kept coming
1GS2uybciaU,8005599,8012719,at us  it just seemed like  you know more and more people started
1GS2uybciaU,8012719,8018079,you know coming on to the west front  they started overpowering us
1GS2uybciaU,8018079,8023440,and that was right about when  mpd's officers showed up
1GS2uybciaU,8023440,8030239,their bike officers  pushed the crowd back  and allowed
1GS2uybciaU,8030239,8035599,our cdu units as well as theirs to form  that line that you see
1GS2uybciaU,8035599,8042560,that very thin line between us  and the protesters or the writers
1GS2uybciaU,8042560,8048400,you know at that time i fell behind that  line  and
1GS2uybciaU,8048400,8055440,for a while i started um decontaminating  people who had gotten
1GS2uybciaU,8055440,8062000,sprayed  and  treating people medically
1GS2uybciaU,8062000,8068000,who who needed it  and then you were injured again uh there
1GS2uybciaU,8068000,8076159,on the west terrace is that right  officer edwards  yes ma'am so um  after a while i got back on the line
1GS2uybciaU,8076159,8083280,um i got it was on the house side  of the lower west terrace
1GS2uybciaU,8083280,8090000,and  i was holding that line for a while  there weren't many of us over there
1GS2uybciaU,8090000,8096880,and officer siknik  was  behind me  for most of the time for about
1GS2uybciaU,8096880,8102239,30 to 45 minutes that i was down there  um
1GS2uybciaU,8102239,8107520,we were just  as the best we could we were just you  know grappling over
1GS2uybciaU,8107520,8113360,bike racks and trying to hold them as  quick as possible
1GS2uybciaU,8115440,8120639,all of the sudden i see  movement
1GS2uybciaU,8120639,8125920,to the left of me  and i turned and it was officer sicknick
1GS2uybciaU,8125920,8132480,with his head and his hands  and he was ghostly pale
1GS2uybciaU,8132480,8139679,which i i figured at that point that he  had been sprayed  and i was
1GS2uybciaU,8139679,8146400,concerned my  you know cop  cop alarm bells went off
1GS2uybciaU,8146400,8153040,because if you get sprayed with  pepper spray  you're going to turn red
1GS2uybciaU,8153040,8160400,he turned  just about as pale as the sheet of paper  and so i looked back to see what had hit
1GS2uybciaU,8160400,8167040,him what had happened  and that's when i got sprayed in the  eyes as well
1GS2uybciaU,8167040,8172159,i was taken to be decontaminated by  another officer
1GS2uybciaU,8172159,8178719,but we didn't get the chance because we  were then tear gassed
1GS2uybciaU,8178719,8185199,and we  are going to play just a brief clip of  of that moment that you've just
1GS2uybciaU,8185199,8189159,described officer edwards
1GS2uybciaU,8192080,8200599,oh  [Applause]

1GS2uybciaU,8220160,8226800,and  one of the things one of the  capitol police officers said to me
1GS2uybciaU,8226800,8233678,recently was  to ask me whether or not as members of  congress all of us understood that
1GS2uybciaU,8233678,8241359,on that day on january 6 when we were  evacuated from the chamber  we're led to a safe undisclosed location
1GS2uybciaU,8241359,8247120,whether we knew that that so many of you  had rushed out of the building and into  the fight and
1GS2uybciaU,8247120,8253518,i can assure you that we do know that  and that we understand how important  your service is

1GS2uybciaU,8283518,8287678,out most vividly in your mind
1GS2uybciaU,8288960,8294638,i can um  that time
1GS2uybciaU,8294638,8301040,when i talked about falling behind  mpd's  line
1GS2uybciaU,8302000,8307040,i remember because i had been  kind of shielded away
1GS2uybciaU,8307040,8314000,because i was holding those stairs  so i wasn't able to really see what was  going on over here
1GS2uybciaU,8314000,8319598,when i fell behind that line  and
1GS2uybciaU,8319598,8326880,i saw  i can just remember  my my breath
1GS2uybciaU,8326880,8334800,catching in my throat  because i what i saw was just a war
1GS2uybciaU,8334800,8340160,scene  it was something like i'd seen out of  the movies
1GS2uybciaU,8340160,8347518,i i couldn't believe my eyes there were  officers on the ground um
1GS2uybciaU,8347518,8353920,you know  they were bleeding they were throwing up  they were you know they had
1GS2uybciaU,8353920,8359040,i mean i saw friends with blood all over  their faces i was slipping in people's
1GS2uybciaU,8359040,8364800,blood um  you know i i was
1GS2uybciaU,8364800,8372398,catching people as they fell  you know i was  it was
1GS2uybciaU,8372558,8380000,carnage  it was chaos  i i can't i can't even
1GS2uybciaU,8380000,8385678,describe  what i saw i never in my wildest dreams
1GS2uybciaU,8385678,8391840,did i think that as  a police officer as a law enforcement  officer i would find myself
1GS2uybciaU,8391840,8397439,in the middle of a battle  you know  i'm trained to
1GS2uybciaU,8397439,8404000,detain  you know a couple of subjects and and  handle you know handle a crowd but i'm
1GS2uybciaU,8404000,8409920,not combat trained  and  that day it was just
1GS2uybciaU,8409920,8415280,hours  of hand-to-hand combat hours of dealing
1GS2uybciaU,8415280,8421280,with things  that were  way beyond any any a law enforcement
1GS2uybciaU,8421280,8428800,officer has ever trained for  and i just remember i just remember that  moment of stepping behind the line and
1GS2uybciaU,8428800,8435520,just seeing  the absolute war zone that the west  front had become
1GS2uybciaU,8439840,8445280,let me thank you  for your service and obviously your  bravery
1GS2uybciaU,8445280,8450479,that you  have told the world about tonight
1GS2uybciaU,8450479,8455279,it's unfortunate that you had to defend  the capital
1GS2uybciaU,8455600,8460960,from fellow americans none of us  would ever
1GS2uybciaU,8460960,8466080,think that that would have to happen but  it did  so let me thank our witnesses for
1GS2uybciaU,8466080,8472399,joining us tonight and sharing their  experiences with america  throughout my chairmanship of this
1GS2uybciaU,8472399,8479040,committee i've continuously vowed that  this committee will ensure a  comprehensive account
1GS2uybciaU,8479040,8484560,of the heroic acts on january 6th  and that we will follow the facts
1GS2uybciaU,8484560,8493120,wherever they lead your testimony is an  essential part  of that record and helps us do our job

1GS2uybciaU,8500640,8507600,the images you recorded  and have shared with  the committee do a better job than any
1GS2uybciaU,8507600,8513200,of our words in reinforcing  the violence of january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,8513200,8518399,we hope that the power of your footage  helped encourage all americans to
1GS2uybciaU,8518399,8526080,consider how citizens with such so much  in common could viciously brawl at the
1GS2uybciaU,8526080,8531600,seat of their democratic government  officer edwards
1GS2uybciaU,8531600,8538960,thank you for your brave service as i  indicated on january 6th  and all you did to protect us
1GS2uybciaU,8538960,8544880,and most importantly our democracy  if you and your fellow officers hadn't
1GS2uybciaU,8544880,8552560,held the line against those violent  insurrectionists  we can only imagine the disaster that
1GS2uybciaU,8552560,8557840,would have ensued  your heroism is the face of danger
1GS2uybciaU,8557840,8565840,that's admirable  and your will to continue to protect and  serve despite your serious injuries
1GS2uybciaU,8565840,8572880,should be an inspiration to all of us  we wish you  a continued recovery
1GS2uybciaU,8572880,8578880,and look forward to seeing you back  in uniform sometime soon
1GS2uybciaU,8578880,8584479,the members of the select committee may  have additional questions for tonight's  witnesses
1GS2uybciaU,8584479,8590319,and we ask that you respond  expeditiously in writing to those  questions
1GS2uybciaU,8590319,8595840,without objections members we permitted  10 business days to submit statements
1GS2uybciaU,8595840,8602080,for the record  including opening remarks and additional  questions for the witnesses
1GS2uybciaU,8602080,8610160,the witnesses have just told us  what they heard the rioters saying  why they stormed the capitol on that day
1GS2uybciaU,8610160,8616399,now we're going to hear it from the  rioters themselves  without objection i include
1GS2uybciaU,8616399,8621319,in the record a video presentation
1GS2uybciaU,8625520,8630800,[Applause]  what really made me want to come was the  fact that
1GS2uybciaU,8630800,8636640,you know i had supported trump all that  time  i did believe you know that the election
1GS2uybciaU,8636640,8641840,was being stolen  and trump asked us to come he personally
1GS2uybciaU,8641840,8648160,asked for us to come to d.c that day  and i thought  for everything he's done for us
1GS2uybciaU,8648160,8653200,if this is the only thing he's going to  ask of me  i'll do it we're going to walk down to
1GS2uybciaU,8653200,8658880,the capitol  did you call president trump mentioning  going to the capitol during his speech
1GS2uybciaU,8658880,8665760,oh yeah so that's one of my  disappointments he said he was going to  go and go with us that he was going to  be there i know why i was there and
1GS2uybciaU,8665760,8671359,that's because he called me there and he  laid out
1GS2uybciaU,8671359,8678479,what is happening in our government  he laid it out but i remember donald  trump telling people to be there right i
1GS2uybciaU,8678479,8685600,mean to support so you mentioned pres  that the president asked you uh do you  remember a specific message
1GS2uybciaU,8685600,8691680,basically yeah yes uh for us to come to  d.c i think things are gonna happen what
1GS2uybciaU,8691680,8698399,got me interested he said i have  something very uh important to say on  january 6 or something like that
1GS2uybciaU,8698399,8705359,as what what what what got me interested  to be there you know trump has only  asked me for two things he asked me for
1GS2uybciaU,8705359,8711398,my vote and he asked me to come on  january 6th
1GS2uybciaU,8713359,8718560,when the committee reconvenes next week  we're going to examine the lies that
1GS2uybciaU,8718560,8725920,convince those men and others to storm  the capital  to try to stop the transfer of power
1GS2uybciaU,8725920,8730960,we're going to take a close look  at the first part of trump's attack
1GS2uybciaU,8730960,8736640,on the rule of law  when he hit the fuse that ultimately  resulted
1GS2uybciaU,8736640,8742479,in the violence of january 6th  without objection and with
1GS2uybciaU,8742479,8746960,with that the committee stands are  joined
1GS2uybciaU,8750240,8755600,so two live witnesses at this uh first  of uh seven uh
1GS2uybciaU,8755600,8762319,extraordinary kind of hearings that  we'll be seeing uh in this month  uh we heard from a former or a member
1GS2uybciaU,8762319,8768319,actually the  capitol police department described what  she called carnage and chaos we also
1GS2uybciaU,8768319,8774640,heard in the second part of tonight's  presentation from a documentary  filmmaker who had some access to the
1GS2uybciaU,8774640,8779920,proud boys  all this color though that leads to the  central theme of what this committee
1GS2uybciaU,8779920,8786880,seems to be trying to point out and  prove is that donald trump was part of a  seven point plan to overturn the results
1GS2uybciaU,8786880,8792319,of the election and prevent a transfer  of power i want to go inside now inside
1GS2uybciaU,8792319,8798640,that hearing room nbc news senior  capitol hill correspondent garrett hake  is actually outside the room what can
1GS2uybciaU,8798640,8803840,you tell us about what's happening  lester i have no idea how this will play
1GS2uybciaU,8803840,8810960,in the rest of the country but in that  hearing room the video that was shown  and the testimony of officer edwards hit
1GS2uybciaU,8810960,8817520,like a sledgehammer you have to remember  this is a community of hundreds back  thousands of people on capitol hill who
1GS2uybciaU,8817520,8824560,lived through january 6 together many  people including lawmakers who were in  the gallery on that day are here in the
1GS2uybciaU,8824560,8831840,hearing room watching and listening  after the video was played they were  coming out in tears too emotional to
1GS2uybciaU,8831840,8837520,speak hugging each other you're even  seeing some of it now with officer  edwards and the other police officers
1GS2uybciaU,8837520,8843920,who sat behind her for her remarks many  of whom have testified themselves  forming kind of this fraternity of
1GS2uybciaU,8843920,8849200,people who have been through this  and so the video had incredible
1GS2uybciaU,8849200,8855439,emotional residence in the room so too  the testimony  of officer edwards i think that's the
1GS2uybciaU,8855439,8860960,kind of thing the committee was was  hoping would also speak to the american  people but for the community on capitol
1GS2uybciaU,8860960,8866000,hill  that's what we went through and that's  what the committee wants the rest of the
1GS2uybciaU,8866000,8872319,country to understand about that day  yeah garrett thank you nbc news  political director and moderator of meet
1GS2uybciaU,8872319,8878080,the press chuck todd is here chuck many  will look at this  who understand the gravity of what
1GS2uybciaU,8878080,8883600,happened in that day but wonder what is  the point  look it's important to have a complete
1GS2uybciaU,8883600,8889760,record i think for for for the history  books number one um but this is
1GS2uybciaU,8889760,8897040,this is the investigation we didn't get  to have in the second impeachment you  know it was rushed for
1GS2uybciaU,8897040,8902800,for reasons that were at the time  i think it you know we could we could  have a debate about you know whether
1GS2uybciaU,8902800,8908880,they should have immediately begun the  impeachment proceedings before january  20th or if they were going to wait then
1GS2uybciaU,8908880,8914880,give it a few months and do a more  complete investigation because i keep  coming back to this lester this is the
1GS2uybciaU,8914880,8920080,single most  this is we've had the mueller report  we've had two impeachments and you have
1GS2uybciaU,8920080,8925439,this four very compelling investigations  into wrongdoing by president trump
1GS2uybciaU,8925439,8930800,this one truly has the receipts  this connects the dots and i tell you
1GS2uybciaU,8930800,8938640,this  it there's basically i think they've  laid out two separate conspiracies  conspiracy one was the one in the lead
1GS2uybciaU,8938640,8944720,up all of the attempts to overturn the  election and then conspiracy two  that i think was laid out pretty
1GS2uybciaU,8944720,8951600,compellingly was the oath keepers and  the proud boys  doing what they were doing here to  essentially take matters into their own
1GS2uybciaU,8951600,8957920,hands if necessary if plan a didn't work  here  i've been waiting to see how much they
1GS2uybciaU,8957920,8964720,can connect the president to that second  part to the attack on the capitol and we  got a very compelling piece of video
1GS2uybciaU,8964720,8970560,there at the end almost like a trailer  about where they're going which is every  one of these folks who have pled guilty
1GS2uybciaU,8970560,8976800,who have been who have been forced to  testify  they all seem to be saying the same  thing i was there because donald trump
1GS2uybciaU,8976800,8982640,asked me to  it was quite compelling  chuck thank you kristin walker is nbc's
1GS2uybciaU,8982640,8988080,chief white house correspondent chris  and let's talk about the reaction from  republicans so far in many ways this
1GS2uybciaU,8988080,8993600,hearing was pre-budded  that's absolutely right lester we're  getting a range of reaction from
1GS2uybciaU,8993600,8998640,republicans who are some dismissing the  hearing outright others trying to
1GS2uybciaU,8998640,9004560,refocus the attention on the economy let  me read you a few jim jordan the  congressman saying where's the prime
1GS2uybciaU,9004560,9009920,time hearing on president biden's  botched afghanistan withdrawal  representative elise stefanik saying
1GS2uybciaU,9009920,9016160,nancy pelosi's select committee is a  political witch hunt we heard from  former president trump before this
1GS2uybciaU,9016160,9021520,hearing got underway he wrote this is a  political hoax to counter inflation and
1GS2uybciaU,9021520,9028000,then senator bill hagerty said for the  first time in history every single state  has hit its highest gas prices ever
1GS2uybciaU,9028000,9034319,recorded that may be the most  significant reaction lester because it  underscores the strategy that we can
1GS2uybciaU,9034319,9040560,expect to see from republicans heading  into the midterms really trying to turn  the page from these hearings and refocus
1GS2uybciaU,9040560,9045600,it on to the top issue for americans  soaring inflation record high gas prices
1GS2uybciaU,9045600,9052880,for his part we haven't heard a reaction  yet from president biden he is traveling  in california a diplomatic summit there
1GS2uybciaU,9052880,9058960,but we are told that he will be watching  bits and pieces of this hearing  throughout the evening i've been talking
1GS2uybciaU,9058960,9064880,to democrats who are close to the white  house who have signaled they are not  going to shy away from trying to link
1GS2uybciaU,9064880,9070399,trump-backed candidates to january 6 to  the horror that unfolded on that day
1GS2uybciaU,9070399,9077040,with the midterms looming large the  question is will these hearings have an  impact on the all-important midterm
1GS2uybciaU,9077040,9083359,elections it is not clear it could have  an impact around the edges some of those  very close races lester but look we are
1GS2uybciaU,9083359,9088399,looking at new video new testimony and  that certainly is significant lester
1GS2uybciaU,9088399,9093439,yeah kristen thank you in both law and  politics as you know are at play in  these hearings so i want to bring in our
1GS2uybciaU,9093439,9100399,nbc news analysts to help provide  clarity on the issues at stake chuck  rosenberg is a former u.s attorney and
1GS2uybciaU,9100399,9105600,senior fbi official yamiche alcindor is  our nbc news washington correspondent
1GS2uybciaU,9105600,9114080,good to have you both here chuck first  we noted at the top of this this is not  a  criminal proceeding it's not even uh uh
1GS2uybciaU,9114080,9120880,action against a president uh so let me  ask you here what what legal bar is  there what's being watched right now uh
1GS2uybciaU,9120880,9127359,at the justice department as they  consider whether  charges could emanate from this  well you're exactly right lester it's
1GS2uybciaU,9127359,9133040,not a criminal proceeding it's not  really even a legal proceeding there are  no rules of evidence there are no rules
1GS2uybciaU,9133040,9139920,of procedure at least ones that i'm  familiar with as a prosecutor there's no  judge there's no cross-examination
1GS2uybciaU,9139920,9146080,are justice department officials  watching this of course they are it's  important to us as americans but it's
1GS2uybciaU,9146080,9151520,also important to them as folks who may  bring additional charges against  additional people
1GS2uybciaU,9151520,9157920,all that said  this is a big complex sprawling  multifaceted story there are parts of it
1GS2uybciaU,9157920,9163439,that we heard today that are just like  what you would hear in court  congresswoman cheney's opening statement
1GS2uybciaU,9163439,9169280,for instance in which she told the jury  in this case the audience what they  would what they will hear what they
1GS2uybciaU,9169280,9175520,should expect to hear  over the coming several weeks of  hearings  there are also parts of this story that
1GS2uybciaU,9175520,9182560,we heard today that are incredibly  compelling and emotional but not  necessarily probative of the central
1GS2uybciaU,9182560,9190080,questions at least central to my mind  which is for instance did president  trump knowingly and intentionally engage
1GS2uybciaU,9190080,9197680,in a plot lead a plot direct the plot uh  to uh impede the congress and to  overturn the electoral vote so
1GS2uybciaU,9197680,9203760,as a prosecutor i have one reaction as  an american quite another  they're not they're not exactly on
1GS2uybciaU,9203760,9210000,parallel tracks but it is a very complex  multifaceted story  and if congresswoman cheney and the
1GS2uybciaU,9210000,9215840,committee deliver what she promised to  deliver i think it'll be compelling  watching
1GS2uybciaU,9215840,9222080,all right now yamiche then there is  politics uh republicans will hear some  of the reaction calling this a political
1GS2uybciaU,9222080,9229520,witch hunt can it be two things can it  be of political use for democrats but  also be very true
1GS2uybciaU,9229520,9234880,it can be uh lester and i've been  talking to a number of people  while they were watching this
1GS2uybciaU,9234880,9241520,republicans and democrats and i should  tell you here are the words that are  coming up for the people i'm speaking  with they're talking about this being
1GS2uybciaU,9241520,9246960,riveting being compelling being stomach  churning i also talked to a former aide
1GS2uybciaU,9246960,9253280,to former president trump who was  involved in making the case that the  2020 election was stolen he was even
1GS2uybciaU,9253280,9259520,traveling to different states and was  part of the legal team that was trying  to convince voters and local officials
1GS2uybciaU,9259520,9266720,to try to overturn the election he told  me that tonight these videos this  testimony these witnesses that they make
1GS2uybciaU,9266720,9272880,former president trump look quote  extremely culpable and he said if  anybody believes that the 2020 election
1GS2uybciaU,9272880,9278240,was rigged after watching this that  they're chasing what he called a fool's  dream of course there is politics in
1GS2uybciaU,9278240,9284800,this we know that there are some  republicans who were already preempting  calling this a witch hunt and and really  trying to make sure that that they
1GS2uybciaU,9284800,9290479,really try to focus the attention of the  republican base and republican voters  away from this hearing but what you saw
1GS2uybciaU,9290479,9296319,of course was that compelling video from  people inside former president trump's  inner circle his daughter the attorney
1GS2uybciaU,9296319,9302160,general and also i'm very interested in  the fact that there was jason miller a  very close a talking about the fact that
1GS2uybciaU,9302160,9307520,former president trump's data person  told him he was going to lose the  election months before he actually lost
1GS2uybciaU,9307520,9313840,it so in this regard i'm really hearing  from people saying that this was a  powerful opening statement i should also
1GS2uybciaU,9313840,9319760,say that someone told me an ethics  lawyer said it was very important for  liz cheney only one of two republicans
1GS2uybciaU,9319760,9326240,on this committee to be part of the of  the person part of the person who was  really talking about the the role that
1GS2uybciaU,9326240,9331520,they see former president trump as  playing saying that he was the center of  the conspiracy of the sprawling
1GS2uybciaU,9331520,9337520,conspiracy to overturn the election they  said that person um it's really  important that liz cheney was one
1GS2uybciaU,9337520,9342800,delivering that message because that in  some ways takes the edge off calling  it's a partisan attack of course we have
1GS2uybciaU,9342800,9348080,heard a lot of republicans including  kevin mccarthy saying that this is  partisan committee but those are some of
1GS2uybciaU,9348080,9353760,the reactions that i'm hearing um the  big question of course will be what  impact will this have will voters who
1GS2uybciaU,9353760,9360160,are dealing with so many other issues  like inflation like the shortage of baby  former like crime and covid will they
1GS2uybciaU,9360160,9365920,pay attention and that question is yet  to be answered  yeah you point out uh some of those who
1GS2uybciaU,9365920,9371120,were center to this first hearing and  those clips were people close
1GS2uybciaU,9371120,9377840,to the former president people who  presumably would not want to do him harm  but testifying and we saw clips of that
1GS2uybciaU,9377840,9383840,senior washington correspondent hallie  jackson also with us what can we expect  in the days ahead this is hearing number
1GS2uybciaU,9383840,9390319,one how will this all play out this is  only the beginning and you heard  congressman liz cheney lay out what to  expect in the next set of hearings the
1GS2uybciaU,9390319,9396479,next one hearing number two will focus  on people close to former president  trump who knew that they were not
1GS2uybciaU,9396479,9402880,telling the truth essentially the  committee's going to try to make the  claim they knew they were lying when  they made these claims of election fraud
1GS2uybciaU,9402880,9409680,that's going to be the focus of the next  hearing after that the third hearing  will be on the fallout at the department  of justice throughout this process the
1GS2uybciaU,9409680,9416720,fourth will be on the pressure campaign  on then vice president mike pence to  throw a wrench into the plans on january
1GS2uybciaU,9416720,9421920,6 which of course uh  pence resisted and i don't want this  moment to go by lester there was another
1GS2uybciaU,9421920,9428640,startling moment a piece of new  information we learned tonight when  congresswoman cheney quoted somebody  saying that at the time at the day of
1GS2uybciaU,9428640,9434240,the insurrection as those riders were  chanting hang my pens  former president trump at the time
1GS2uybciaU,9434240,9440720,turned to somebody in the room and said  something along the lines of pence  deserves it that was  an extraordinary moment last week we're
1GS2uybciaU,9440720,9446080,going to be hearing more about that in  the weeks to come the fifth hearing will  focus on the fake electors scheme that
1GS2uybciaU,9446080,9453120,was put in place to try to subvert the  legitimate results of the election and  then the last two those will be the  connecting of the dots specifically in
1GS2uybciaU,9453120,9459280,the moments leading up to and on january  6. so more of that compelling video that  testimony that we've seen as we're
1GS2uybciaU,9459280,9465040,looking at this live shot lester i just  want to quickly mention we've seen some  people hear the people in the room and  we've heard some of them mentioned
1GS2uybciaU,9465040,9470720,officers who were at the capitol that  day there's a woman a blonde woman in a  blue dress who we just saw erin smith i
1GS2uybciaU,9470720,9475920,spoke with her today she is  the wife of officer jeff smith of the
1GS2uybciaU,9475920,9482720,metro d.c police who died in the line of  duty his death ruled a line of duty  death after he died by suicide nine days
1GS2uybciaU,9482720,9489920,after the insurrection and  mrs smith told me first of all she's in  talks potentially to come forward and be
1GS2uybciaU,9489920,9495200,one of the witnesses the live witnesses  in one of these hearings and she said  she wants to do that she wants people to
1GS2uybciaU,9495200,9500640,know that there were officers who went  to the capitol that day to defend  democracy she does not want their
1GS2uybciaU,9500640,9506399,stories to be forgotten i think that  also speaks to what we heard from  officer edwards here tonight lester and  what has been
1GS2uybciaU,9506399,9512640,a notable two plus hours now from the  select committee  yeah and this uh select committee uh
1GS2uybciaU,9512640,9518240,putting a pretty high bar saying they'll  play out this seven part plan to  overturn the election with donald trump
1GS2uybciaU,9518240,9524080,they hold at its head that concludes our  special prime time coverage of the  january 6 hearings there will be much
1GS2uybciaU,9524080,9530170,more tomorrow on all this on today for  now i'm lester holt thank you for  joining us good night
