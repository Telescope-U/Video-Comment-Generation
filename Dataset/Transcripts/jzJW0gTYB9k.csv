jzJW0gTYB9k,190319,192159,these vertical jumps are nothing but
jzJW0gTYB9k,192159,193840,impressive but what if i told you

jzJW0gTYB9k,220159,222720,was this play by lionel messi except
jzJW0gTYB9k,222720,224799,instead of just one opponent
jzJW0gTYB9k,224799,227280,he humiliated a whole team to start
jzJW0gTYB9k,227280,229200,things off his teammate comes up with
jzJW0gTYB9k,229200,231440,some incredible moves then messi gets
jzJW0gTYB9k,231440,233120,the ball and you would think that one
jzJW0gTYB9k,233120,235680,nutmeg was enough but nah think again
jzJW0gTYB9k,235680,237920,then shortly after one
jzJW0gTYB9k,237920,240319,two three defenders gone and then he
jzJW0gTYB9k,240319,242080,leaves it on a plate for his teammate to
jzJW0gTYB9k,242080,244000,score an easy goal
jzJW0gTYB9k,244000,246000,by the way we found this sick camera

jzJW0gTYB9k,306000,307919,was nothing sometimes you only need one
jzJW0gTYB9k,307919,310240,player in this next one however spanish
jzJW0gTYB9k,310240,312000,teamless pumice produced some of the
jzJW0gTYB9k,312000,316320,most beautiful teamwork you've ever seen
jzJW0gTYB9k,321680,323680,this back heel alone is worth making a
jzJW0gTYB9k,323680,325759,compilation reel combine that with this
jzJW0gTYB9k,325759,328080,beautiful acrobatic finish and you have
jzJW0gTYB9k,328080,330400,one special goal it doesn't get much
jzJW0gTYB9k,330400,332560,more skillful than that one now compare
jzJW0gTYB9k,332560,334560,that to this westbrook dunk that was
jzJW0gTYB9k,334560,338360,just pure luck

jzJW0gTYB9k,348240,350400,sorcery he's using or if it was a glitch
jzJW0gTYB9k,350400,352479,in the matrix because that's simply not
jzJW0gTYB9k,352479,354960,supposed to happen while that was weird
jzJW0gTYB9k,354960,357440,this nhl goal is even stranger watch how
jzJW0gTYB9k,357440,358960,the puck gets stuck in the goalie's
jzJW0gTYB9k,358960,361960,pants

jzJW0gTYB9k,372610,374960,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,374960,377199,due to some crazy wind this game was
jzJW0gTYB9k,377199,379039,almost unplayable thanks to the weather
jzJW0gTYB9k,379039,380960,conditions though this guy managed to
jzJW0gTYB9k,380960,383199,score one of the craziest goals of all
jzJW0gTYB9k,383199,385280,time
jzJW0gTYB9k,385280,388400,goes all the way in
jzJW0gTYB9k,388560,391280,the wind of change has blown through
jzJW0gTYB9k,391280,393360,the weather conditions here
jzJW0gTYB9k,393360,395199,just a hopeful in-swinging ball and it
jzJW0gTYB9k,395199,397199,just rides on the windy
jzJW0gTYB9k,397199,400400,wind assisted

jzJW0gTYB9k,421919,423759,this guy will probably go down as one of
jzJW0gTYB9k,423759,425759,the most savage football players of all
jzJW0gTYB9k,425759,428000,time in a world cup penalty shootout he
jzJW0gTYB9k,428000,430910,decided to play without his goalkeeper
jzJW0gTYB9k,430910,435599,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,435599,437520,but gloves not everything he then went

jzJW0gTYB9k,439520,441759,himself securing a place in the world
jzJW0gTYB9k,441759,445120,cup final talk about clutch player
jzJW0gTYB9k,445120,447199,now for what might very well be the

jzJW0gTYB9k,217120,220159,now that was one humiliating move and so
jzJW0gTYB9k,220159,222720,was this play by lionel messi except
jzJW0gTYB9k,222720,224799,instead of just one opponent
jzJW0gTYB9k,224799,227280,he humiliated a whole team to start
jzJW0gTYB9k,227280,229200,things off his teammate comes up with
jzJW0gTYB9k,229200,231440,some incredible moves then messi gets
jzJW0gTYB9k,231440,233120,the ball and you would think that one
jzJW0gTYB9k,233120,235680,nutmeg was enough but nah think again
jzJW0gTYB9k,235680,237920,then shortly after one
jzJW0gTYB9k,237920,240319,two three defenders gone and then he
jzJW0gTYB9k,240319,242080,leaves it on a plate for his teammate to
jzJW0gTYB9k,242080,244000,score an easy goal
jzJW0gTYB9k,244000,246000,by the way we found this sick camera
jzJW0gTYB9k,246000,249530,angle recorded by a fan
jzJW0gTYB9k,249530,254289,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,255280,256479,i don't think there's anyone who could
jzJW0gTYB9k,256479,258079,watch that without being completely
jzJW0gTYB9k,258079,260720,blown away except connor mcdavid is
jzJW0gTYB9k,260720,264240,having trouble changing here
jzJW0gTYB9k,264800,266080,wait wait wait wait wait we need to play
jzJW0gTYB9k,266080,269840,that with some disco music dj

jzJW0gTYB9k,303199,306000,wow you just covered 95 yards like it
jzJW0gTYB9k,306000,307919,was nothing sometimes you only need one
jzJW0gTYB9k,307919,310240,player in this next one however spanish
jzJW0gTYB9k,310240,312000,teamless pumice produced some of the
jzJW0gTYB9k,312000,316320,most beautiful teamwork you've ever seen
jzJW0gTYB9k,321680,323680,this back heel alone is worth making a
jzJW0gTYB9k,323680,325759,compilation reel combine that with this
jzJW0gTYB9k,325759,328080,beautiful acrobatic finish and you have
jzJW0gTYB9k,328080,330400,one special goal it doesn't get much
jzJW0gTYB9k,330400,332560,more skillful than that one now compare
jzJW0gTYB9k,332560,334560,that to this westbrook dunk that was
jzJW0gTYB9k,334560,338360,just pure luck
jzJW0gTYB9k,339250,341030,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,341030,341480,[Music]
jzJW0gTYB9k,341480,344479,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,344479,346320,what are the odds for that even
jzJW0gTYB9k,346320,348240,happening i don't know what kind of
jzJW0gTYB9k,348240,350400,sorcery he's using or if it was a glitch
jzJW0gTYB9k,350400,352479,in the matrix because that's simply not
jzJW0gTYB9k,352479,354960,supposed to happen while that was weird
jzJW0gTYB9k,354960,357440,this nhl goal is even stranger watch how
jzJW0gTYB9k,357440,358960,the puck gets stuck in the goalie's
jzJW0gTYB9k,358960,361960,pants
jzJW0gTYB9k,364230,365110,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,365110,366030,[Music]
jzJW0gTYB9k,366030,370489,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,372610,374960,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,374960,377199,due to some crazy wind this game was
jzJW0gTYB9k,377199,379039,almost unplayable thanks to the weather
jzJW0gTYB9k,379039,380960,conditions though this guy managed to
jzJW0gTYB9k,380960,383199,score one of the craziest goals of all
jzJW0gTYB9k,383199,385280,time
jzJW0gTYB9k,385280,388400,goes all the way in
jzJW0gTYB9k,388560,391280,the wind of change has blown through
jzJW0gTYB9k,391280,393360,the weather conditions here
jzJW0gTYB9k,393360,395199,just a hopeful in-swinging ball and it
jzJW0gTYB9k,395199,397199,just rides on the windy
jzJW0gTYB9k,397199,400400,wind assisted
jzJW0gTYB9k,401280,404759,let's go
jzJW0gTYB9k,405960,408300,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,408300,408550,[Music]
jzJW0gTYB9k,408550,414819,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,421919,423759,this guy will probably go down as one of
jzJW0gTYB9k,423759,425759,the most savage football players of all
jzJW0gTYB9k,425759,428000,time in a world cup penalty shootout he
jzJW0gTYB9k,428000,430910,decided to play without his goalkeeper
jzJW0gTYB9k,430910,435599,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,435599,437520,but gloves not everything he then went
jzJW0gTYB9k,437520,439520,on to score the deciding penalty shot
jzJW0gTYB9k,439520,441759,himself securing a place in the world
jzJW0gTYB9k,441759,445120,cup final talk about clutch player
jzJW0gTYB9k,445120,447199,now for what might very well be the
jzJW0gTYB9k,447199,450920,weirdest goal in sports history
jzJW0gTYB9k,450920,455199,[Applause]
jzJW0gTYB9k,458800,461599,i have never seen this i saw it in a
jzJW0gTYB9k,461599,462880,video
jzJW0gTYB9k,462880,464879,because i wanted to see
jzJW0gTYB9k,464879,466639,if a goal like that would count the
jzJW0gTYB9k,466639,469120,referee is very much part of the game
jzJW0gTYB9k,469120,471039,and that goal would count i've never
jzJW0gTYB9k,471039,473520,seen this
