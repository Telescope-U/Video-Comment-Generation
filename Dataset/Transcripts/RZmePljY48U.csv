RZmePljY48U,560,15920,this is the renault megane e-tec it's a quirky  ev and i really like it why keep watching
RZmePljY48U,34240,39200,the electric megane is shorter than the  megane 4 and even shorter than the megane 3.  
RZmePljY48U,39200,46000,it has a longer wheelbase it's taller but narrower  strange but then is an eevee on a new platform  
RZmePljY48U,46720,51360,the front is smooth and round and the air  intake is masked in the lower part of the bumper  
RZmePljY48U,52000,57120,gold elements on the corners under the funky  daytime running lights lead into actual air  
RZmePljY48U,57120,63280,ducts which have aerodynamic benefits after  all evs have to be efficient in every way  
RZmePljY48U,64239,69119,from the side you'll notice black cladding  around the wheel arches along with the sills and  
RZmePljY48U,69120,74640,the bottom part of the door these are supposed to  make the car look less chunky i guess there is an  
RZmePljY48U,74640,80720,11 centimeters thick battery in the floor and the  silver line from the a-pillar kinking around the  
RZmePljY48U,80720,88800,c-pillar makes the roof seem suspended over the  car in the rear i lined the 3d lamps and a light  
RZmePljY48U,88800,94080,strip across the boot lid a lot of black with some  gold accents on the bottom to mask the battery  
RZmePljY48U,94080,99120,it looks interesting and the megane turns heads  many people have no idea what they're looking  
RZmePljY48U,99120,105040,at but them again was always interesting  in the megane 4 review a few years ago i  
RZmePljY48U,105040,110400,even said it's probably the best looking compact  hatchback you'll see in the showrooms that year  
RZmePljY48U,112320,118640,first things first how do i get in well if  i have the key with me the door handles just  
RZmePljY48U,118640,125280,pop out but what if i don't have the key on  me or if i disable the hands-free operation  
RZmePljY48U,127040,134560,okay oh this is interesting fortunately  the rear door handles are concealed in  
RZmePljY48U,134560,138880,the sea pillars which may fool some  into thinking this is a coupe anyway  
RZmePljY48U,138880,143600,renault doesn't care much about passengers  in the back but more about that later
RZmePljY48U,148880,154880,inside we are greeted with a sound and a graphics  display nothing strange if it was played when i  
RZmePljY48U,154880,160640,press the start button instead it is played when  i open the door or when the passenger opens the  
RZmePljY48U,160640,168640,door fortunately this can be turned off another  quirk is the seat memory function not your regular  
RZmePljY48U,168640,174960,button on the door or on the seat affair instead  there is a prompt on the screen and i know it  
RZmePljY48U,174960,182400,works i just don't know how for sure the sitting  position is low like in a traditional car because  
RZmePljY48U,182400,189599,of the batteries in the floor obviously the driver  gets a wide display with several viewing options  
RZmePljY48U,190320,195360,including a map and you can sort of  change your most important settings or  
RZmePljY48U,196160,204000,computer readouts like your range and the day trip  meter with the button on the right side on the  
RZmePljY48U,204000,206800,of the wheel and on the left side  are the cruise control buttons  
RZmePljY48U,207520,210880,in the middle is the large infotainment  screen this is where i tell you that again  
RZmePljY48U,210880,217440,e-tech runs android automotive i've experienced  this already in the electric volvo xc40 recharge  
RZmePljY48U,217440,222720,the system can be synced with your google  account should be actually so in theory you don't  
RZmePljY48U,222720,230240,have to use android auto unfortunately android  automotive is far from what i would consider to be  
RZmePljY48U,231200,237120,ready for prime time let's say for example  google's native podcasts app in android automotive  
RZmePljY48U,238560,245840,looks like early irc chatroom stream forget  about manual refresh or playing the podcast  
RZmePljY48U,245840,250560,from where you left off on your mobile  device so you have to start android auto  
RZmePljY48U,251680,256959,but when you set android out or sata for example  you lose the map on the driver's display you also  
RZmePljY48U,256959,262400,lose charging network information i'm not sure how  the system works in western europe but in poland  
RZmePljY48U,262400,269840,google automotive shows only one charging network  unfortunately basic climate control functions are  
RZmePljY48U,269840,274720,still set with physical buttons for which the  designers should receive medals monuments and  
RZmePljY48U,274720,280720,special pension bonuses i also like this little  detail this bit of plastic under the screen  
RZmePljY48U,280720,287840,has a bit rougher anti-slip texture so i can rest  my fingers on it why so that my hand doesn't move  
RZmePljY48U,287840,294000,about when i'm pressing something on the screen  the interior is dark neither the ambient lighting  
RZmePljY48U,294000,300720,nor the pixelated faux wood make it look any  brighter however in the top spec there is a light  
RZmePljY48U,300720,307360,interior upholstery option i strongly recommend  it the wireless charger under the central screen  
RZmePljY48U,307360,313439,is big enough for large smartphones in protective  cases i don't know about your phone but mine is so  
RZmePljY48U,313440,319120,slippery it slides off the table just from looking  at it so i need a protective case sounds familiar  
RZmePljY48U,319760,325200,drop me a comment below the charger is a  large storage cubby and two cup holders  
RZmePljY48U,325200,330800,one of them is so deep under the center console  the driver should not be using it the armrest  
RZmePljY48U,330800,337919,slides to reveal a coin cubby and two usb c ports  storage under the armrest is average size and so  
RZmePljY48U,337920,343840,is the glove box i know it's broken that's how  i got it door pockets accommodate large bottles
RZmePljY48U,346000,354000,and one more thing before we set off the drive  selector is one of three stocks here behind on  
RZmePljY48U,354000,358400,the right side of the steering wheel there's  the media stock the wiper stock and then the  
RZmePljY48U,359200,379840,drive selector convince me this is  a good idea drop me a comment below
RZmePljY48U,399040,404000,it's worth clarifying the magan e-tec can  mean the fourth generation plug-in hybrid or  
RZmePljY48U,404000,410960,the fifth generation ev the electric  megane e-tec comes in ev40 or ev60 variants  
RZmePljY48U,410960,415199,which is exactly what you think the  battery size expressed in kilowatt hours  
RZmePljY48U,415200,422880,the electric motor power output is 130 or 218  horsepower respectively and the range is up to 300  
RZmePljY48U,422880,430640,or up to 450 kilometers respectively this is the  more powerful ev60 renault claims this car will  
RZmePljY48U,430640,436880,use around 16 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers  divide 60 by 16 and you get 375 kilometer  
RZmePljY48U,436880,441440,kilometers which is 75 less than the claimed  range on the motorway of the cruise control  
RZmePljY48U,441440,447760,set to 120 kilometers per hour the megan e-tech  uses 18 19 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers so  
RZmePljY48U,447760,453200,realistic range can drop to about 300 kilometers  however around the city i managed to get below  
RZmePljY48U,453200,460720,12 kilowatt hours which means a theoretical range  of more than 500 kilometers helping achieve this  
RZmePljY48U,460720,467120,range is four stage recuperation which you  can set using paddles on the steering wheel  
RZmePljY48U,468240,473599,as it is the case with evs a lot depends on the  road conditions driving style and weather i was on  
RZmePljY48U,473600,479520,an 850 kilometers road trip with this car and half  of the way it was raining heavily the temperature  
RZmePljY48U,479520,485599,dropped from 20 degrees to 13 degrees celsius  i used wipers the mister phones were charging  
RZmePljY48U,485600,492480,18 to 19 kilowatt hours in the winter i expected  to be even more though the optional heat pump may  
RZmePljY48U,492480,499280,help lesser the cold weather impact speaking of  the weather renault-megane e-tac has automatic  
RZmePljY48U,499280,505040,headlights which work not only in the dark but  also when it rains in poland you have to turn your  
RZmePljY48U,505040,510800,headlights on when there is poor visibility and  that includes rain some automatic headlights don't  
RZmePljY48U,510800,516320,turn on with the wipers and many people drive  around only with their daytime running lights  
RZmePljY48U,517120,522320,now i'd probably get a better result if i used  eco mode all the time however eco mode limits the  
RZmePljY48U,522320,528080,top speed to 100 kilometers per hour yes you can  overcome it with pushing the accelerator harder  
RZmePljY48U,528080,534000,but that's just to overtake and then the car  quickly slows down back to 100 to select the  
RZmePljY48U,534000,538800,drive mode you have to press a button on the  steering wheel i'd rather have a turning switch  
RZmePljY48U,538800,544560,so i don't have to toggle through various modes  and take my eyes of the road i used adaptive  
RZmePljY48U,544560,549840,cruise control during most of my trip it works  well and so does the active lane keeping assist
RZmePljY48U,552480,557040,i usually complain about the state of  charging infrastructure in poland but  
RZmePljY48U,557040,563519,this time chargers were conveniently  placed and mostly unoccupied and  
RZmePljY48U,564240,570320,they mostly worked the megan e tag can take  up to 130 kilowatts but the peak seems to be  
RZmePljY48U,570320,576800,rather at a low state of charge which this  graph from the french car website confirms  
RZmePljY48U,578560,585200,depending on the spec the megan e-tec can be had  with a 7 or 22 kilowatt on-board charger watch  
RZmePljY48U,585200,590320,out for the charging port on the right front  fender it's great when you charge curbside  
RZmePljY48U,590320,599360,less so if you have a tight garage and you park  front first my trip was 425 kilometers one way  
RZmePljY48U,599360,605440,on the first leg of the journey i charged only  once and then used a type 2 charger at the hotel  
RZmePljY48U,605440,610960,on the way back i charged twice just enough to  grab a bite to eat and take a quick toilet break  
RZmePljY48U,612720,617360,since i was in the mountains it would probably  be wiser to start my return trip with the battery  
RZmePljY48U,617360,624480,discharged slightly to take advantage of downhill  recuperation but that's just me optimizing because  
RZmePljY48U,624480,630959,of poland's sparse charging infrastructure for  exact cost breakdown you'd have to use your local  
RZmePljY48U,630960,638480,energy and charging prices i did a road trip  in the bmw ix from poland into the alps and you  
RZmePljY48U,638480,643920,can watch this for an exact breakdown of costs  link on the screen and in the description below  
RZmePljY48U,644800,650800,the megan e-tec road trip across poland cost  me about 5 euros 70 cents per 100 kilometers  
RZmePljY48U,650800,655519,this takes into account charging the car at  home before the trip charging at the hotel  
RZmePljY48U,655520,660960,and three fast charging stops along the way for  reference at the time of filming regular petrol  
RZmePljY48U,660960,666720,and diesel prices in germany were just above 2  euro per liter so this means a car would have to  
RZmePljY48U,666720,675199,use about 3 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers to  be as economical as an ev this of course doesn't  
RZmePljY48U,675200,679440,take into account the charging time and the  availability of the charging infrastructure  
RZmePljY48U,680480,687600,however if you put all these little things in  place you have electro mobility and it's easy  
RZmePljY48U,687600,694480,and it's cheap renault claims the megan  e-tec ev60 accelerates from zero to 100  
RZmePljY48U,694480,700480,kilometers per hour in 7.4 seconds and this is  exactly what i got both in eco and sport mode  
RZmePljY48U,701680,708000,but like other evs also the megan e tag is quick  mainly in a straight line faster corners are  
RZmePljY48U,708000,713120,not for the faint-hearted as the car can  understeer heavily some car makers try  
RZmePljY48U,713120,719440,to cheat physics with all-wheel drive more than  1600 kilograms is a lot for a compact hatchback  
RZmePljY48U,721200,726080,otherwise the mcgann e-tec road trip as well as  driving around town was a pleasant experience  
RZmePljY48U,726080,731920,for me and for my passenger who was sitting in  the front maneuvering around the city is easy  
RZmePljY48U,731920,738639,with the 10.4 meter turning circle also  the 360 camera helps you get your bearings  
RZmePljY48U,738640,745280,i like that the automatic parking brake stays  on even after you restart the car if i were to  
RZmePljY48U,745280,749520,complain about something it would be the rear  visibility which is limited by the falling  
RZmePljY48U,749520,754880,roofline and the extra camera mounted right  in the middle of the rear window this camera  
RZmePljY48U,754880,759520,is for the virtual mirror which should solve  the poor visibility problem but in my opinion  
RZmePljY48U,759520,765440,it doesn't help much as my eyes cannot accommodate  quick enough between the 3d view in front  
RZmePljY48U,765440,771840,and 2d view on the screen so close to my  face and what about the rear passengers well  
RZmePljY48U,772640,778960,i don't think renault planned any  there is very little legroom headroom  
RZmePljY48U,778960,785120,and even the space for feet under the front seats  is scarce there is no armrest no cupholders even  
RZmePljY48U,785120,792400,the door pockets are very narrow but there are  two usbc ports and some air vents the boot has  
RZmePljY48U,792400,798480,390 liters and some more storage for cables under  the floor there is no franc which would be useful  
RZmePljY48U,798480,804160,when you're on a road trip and you want to bring  a type 2 charging cable not all hotels have them  
RZmePljY48U,805360,810880,but that's not a big deal i think a bigger deal  is the water dropping into the boot from the wet  
RZmePljY48U,810880,817280,tailgate just like in the megan 4 and like in the  megan 4 also here the boot sill is too high and  
RZmePljY48U,817280,822640,there's a hump when you fold the seats this car  could really use a double floor at least there  
RZmePljY48U,822640,828560,are shopping bag hooks oh and which beautiful  mind made the tailgate opening too narrow for  
RZmePljY48U,828560,835440,the parcel shelf when you close the tailgate you  first hear the shelf hitting the stoppers bravo
RZmePljY48U,838160,845040,prices of the renault-gun e-tag start  at 200 euro for the equilibrium ev40  
RZmePljY48U,845040,851759,add the six and a half grand for the ev60  this test car is the iconic ev60 for around 50  
RZmePljY48U,851760,858880,000 euro minus any local incentives my  week with the renault mcgann e-tech was  
RZmePljY48U,858880,864640,surprisingly pleasant i drove it for more than  1000 kilometers and i really enjoyed it unless  
RZmePljY48U,864640,870320,winter weather seriously impacts the battery  performance i'd seriously consider one and  
RZmePljY48U,870320,874560,how do you like the renault again e-tech  let me know in the comment section below  
RZmePljY48U,875200,880160,if you like my sarcastic down-to-earth  and possibly mildly amusing car reviews  
RZmePljY48U,880160,886560,join me every friday 3pm central european time  and don't forget to subscribe and like this video  
RZmePljY48U,886560,894960,as it helps me with the youtube algorithm thanks  for watching and i will see you in the next one
