HtbrB3xeb-Y,3545,4963,- What people don't want  is essentially
HtbrB3xeb-Y,4963,6548,the education system  we have right now.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,7757,10135,"A standardized system with standardized assessments,"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,10135,11720,"leading to standardized outcomes,"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,11720,13888,that treats every kid  exactly the same.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,13888,17349,The problem is these people are absolutely convinced
HtbrB3xeb-Y,17350,18685,that most people still want
HtbrB3xeb-Y,18685,20145,the existing standardized system—
HtbrB3xeb-Y,20311,21938,which is a 'collective illusion.'
HtbrB3xeb-Y,23064,26151,A collective illusion is a situation where most people
HtbrB3xeb-Y,26151,30154,in a group go along with an idea that they don't agree with
HtbrB3xeb-Y,30155,32991,simply because they incorrectly think
HtbrB3xeb-Y,32991,36161,that most other people in the group agree with it.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,36161,38538,If I believe most everybody else in the country
HtbrB3xeb-Y,38538,42167,is more or less happy with the one-size-fits-all system
HtbrB3xeb-Y,42167,44419,and college is the only indicator
HtbrB3xeb-Y,44419,46420,"of success, nothing's  gonna change."
HtbrB3xeb-Y,55889,57474,What we're witnessing right now
HtbrB3xeb-Y,57474,59892,across the country is a pretty dramatic shift
HtbrB3xeb-Y,59893,61436,in the way people think about their relationship
HtbrB3xeb-Y,61436,63396,between people and  our institutions.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,63396,66399,And nowhere is that more prevalent than in education.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,68276,71529,Out of the 66 possibilities that an institution
HtbrB3xeb-Y,71529,73073,"of higher education could deliver,"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,73073,76493,"what we wanted to understand is, 'What do you prioritize?'"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,78411,82791,"What you're given is a task that says, 'School A, School B'—"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,82791,87462,six of those 66 attributes are randomly grabbed for School A.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,87462,89506,Another six are grabbed  for School B—
HtbrB3xeb-Y,89506,91048,which one of these do you choose?
HtbrB3xeb-Y,91466,93676,"Do it again with six others, and that allows us"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,93676,97514,to build a profile for you of your trade-off priorities
HtbrB3xeb-Y,97514,99015,for higher education.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,99015,102310,What people think people want out of higher education
HtbrB3xeb-Y,102310,105687,is the prestigious school with a great sports team
HtbrB3xeb-Y,105688,107315,and an active social life.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,107315,109526,What people actually  want out of higher ed
HtbrB3xeb-Y,109526,112487,is to get a good job that is meaningful to them
HtbrB3xeb-Y,112487,115406,and to do that with as little debt as possible.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,117659,119701,There are incredible institutions
HtbrB3xeb-Y,119702,122038,of higher education who are giving us a vision
HtbrB3xeb-Y,122038,124040,of what the future of higher education will be.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,125458,129921,"They are doing things that are modularized, individualized,"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,129921,133258,customized—using credentials instead of diplomas
HtbrB3xeb-Y,133258,135385,to create better signals  for employers.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,136136,138513,People are really interested not just in having
HtbrB3xeb-Y,138513,141808,"an undifferentiated diploma, but also a hybrid—"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,142225,144185,"on-the-job training, apprenticeships."
HtbrB3xeb-Y,144394,146437,It's not simply book  smarts that gets you
HtbrB3xeb-Y,146437,147647,the job that you want.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,148231,151025,"Success is not just going to college,"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,151025,152986,"it is actually, 'Are we equipping you"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,152986,154903,to live the life that you wanna live?'
HtbrB3xeb-Y,156114,157615,Parents know their kids better
HtbrB3xeb-Y,157615,159200,than bureaucrats know their kids.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,159200,161327,Communities know  their values better
HtbrB3xeb-Y,161327,163913,than the federal government knows a community's values.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,163913,167500,Where there's a lot of common ground is in this commitment
HtbrB3xeb-Y,167500,171462,to a far more individualized educational experience.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,171963,176301,"Education is, and always will be, the great equalizer,"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,176301,179429,the best vehicle for  enabling people
HtbrB3xeb-Y,179429,181973,to actually live the kind of lives they wanna live.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,181973,183683,"That might be college  for some people,"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,183683,185602,it might be trades for others.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,185602,187770,What social entrepreneurs  need to do
HtbrB3xeb-Y,187770,191065,"is build the solutions, and dismantle the illusions."
HtbrB3xeb-Y,191065,192859,If we get it right and  we acknowledge
HtbrB3xeb-Y,192859,196028,"the collective illusion, recognize our common desires"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,196029,198406,"for the purpose of education moving forward,"
HtbrB3xeb-Y,198406,201701,there's an opportunity to drive pretty substantial change.
HtbrB3xeb-Y,201701,204162,And we can actually have the education system
HtbrB3xeb-Y,204162,205997,that we want and deserve.
