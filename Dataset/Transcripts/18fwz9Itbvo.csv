18fwz9Itbvo,0,3335,"- The brewmaster, of course, is a magical person."
18fwz9Itbvo,3335,4270,[laughs]
18fwz9Itbvo,4270,7240,"Hi, I'm Garrett Oliver, author of ""The Brewmaster's Table"""
18fwz9Itbvo,7240,9049,and brewmaster of Brooklyn Brewery.
18fwz9Itbvo,9050,13150,"But today, I am here to answer your questions on Twitter,"
18fwz9Itbvo,13150,15493,because this is Beer Support.
18fwz9Itbvo,15494,18077,[upbeat music]
18fwz9Itbvo,19867,24437,"@dogsandbaseball, love that, asks, ""What are hops?"
18fwz9Itbvo,24437,26337,"""And no, I'm not Googling it."
18fwz9Itbvo,26337,28660,"""I just want someone to just tell me."""
18fwz9Itbvo,28660,30670,"It's like, okay, I'm the guy to just tell you."
18fwz9Itbvo,30670,33050,So these are hops.
18fwz9Itbvo,33050,36600,The hop is a green pine cone-shaped flower.
18fwz9Itbvo,36600,38329,"It grows on a vine, in this country,"
18fwz9Itbvo,38330,40470,largely in the Pacific Northwest.
18fwz9Itbvo,40470,44530,"And when that hop cone, that little flower grows out,"
18fwz9Itbvo,44530,46489,that is where you're going to develop
18fwz9Itbvo,46490,47910,all your flavors and aromas.
18fwz9Itbvo,47910,49550,"Now, here's an interesting fact."
18fwz9Itbvo,49550,53120,The hop is the nearest botanical relative to cannabis.
18fwz9Itbvo,53120,55710,"This hop flower, you have resins,"
18fwz9Itbvo,55710,58399,and those residents are giving you bitterness.
18fwz9Itbvo,58400,59670,They're giving you flavor.
18fwz9Itbvo,59670,61120,They're giving you aromas
18fwz9Itbvo,61120,63780,"Hops are varietal, like wine grapes."
18fwz9Itbvo,63780,65880,There are about 100 varieties
18fwz9Itbvo,65880,68219,of hops available on the market right now.
18fwz9Itbvo,68220,69550,Some of them taste floral.
18fwz9Itbvo,69550,71200,Some of them smell like citrus.
18fwz9Itbvo,71200,72860,Some of them smell kinda dank.
18fwz9Itbvo,72860,75030,"There used to be a lot of spices used in beer,"
18fwz9Itbvo,75030,78720,but the hop became often the only spice in beer
18fwz9Itbvo,78720,83370,"because it also acts to retard the growth of bacteria,"
18fwz9Itbvo,83370,85560,and bacteria can spoil your beer.
18fwz9Itbvo,85560,89079,"And so, people started to notice, the more hops you add,"
18fwz9Itbvo,89080,90880,the longer the beer was going to last.
18fwz9Itbvo,90880,93979,"And so, hops became really the focal point"
18fwz9Itbvo,93980,96162,for bitter beer flavors.
18fwz9Itbvo,96162,97829,"@James24147374 asks,"
18fwz9Itbvo,101807,104340,"""How do you make beer without yeast?"""
18fwz9Itbvo,104340,106000,"Sorry, James, you can't."
18fwz9Itbvo,106000,107630,You have to have yeast in there
18fwz9Itbvo,107630,110229,to ferment your sugar into alcohol
18fwz9Itbvo,110230,112780,and to make all the flavors that we associate with beer.
18fwz9Itbvo,112780,114990,"You can use other things besides yeast,"
18fwz9Itbvo,114990,116950,"like bacterial strains, etc.,"
18fwz9Itbvo,116950,118746,but you gotta have yeast to get the job done.
18fwz9Itbvo,118747,123510,"@adzierman asks, ""Is beer chemistry?"""
18fwz9Itbvo,123510,124343,Hmm.
18fwz9Itbvo,124343,125760,"Well, beer is chemistry."
18fwz9Itbvo,125760,127900,Beer is also biology.
18fwz9Itbvo,127900,129830,Beer is also art.
18fwz9Itbvo,129830,131220,"Wine is easy, right?"
18fwz9Itbvo,131220,133120,"You got some grapes, grapes have sugar."
18fwz9Itbvo,133120,134799,"You stomp on 'em, whatever else."
18fwz9Itbvo,134800,136630,They might start fermenting by themselves.
18fwz9Itbvo,136630,137860,And you have wine.
18fwz9Itbvo,137860,139330,Beer is tougher.
18fwz9Itbvo,139330,140320,We're starting with this.
18fwz9Itbvo,140320,142410,There's no sugar in barley malt.
18fwz9Itbvo,142410,145360,"You have to break down the starch in this into sugars,"
18fwz9Itbvo,145360,147670,which you do in a porridge called the mash.
18fwz9Itbvo,147670,150160,The natural enzymes that are in the malt
18fwz9Itbvo,150160,151790,break the starches down to sugar.
18fwz9Itbvo,151790,153010,Then you have a formulation.
18fwz9Itbvo,153010,153860,Is it gonna be dark?
18fwz9Itbvo,153860,155840,Is it going to be red 'cause it has fruit in it?
18fwz9Itbvo,155840,158110,Is it gonna be kind of a caramel color like that?
18fwz9Itbvo,158110,159690,And that's a bit more art.
18fwz9Itbvo,159690,162370,"And then you have biology because you're going to add yeast,"
18fwz9Itbvo,162370,164379,which is then going to consume those sugars
18fwz9Itbvo,164380,167270,"and give off carbon dioxide, flavors,"
18fwz9Itbvo,167270,168770,"and of course, alcohol."
18fwz9Itbvo,168770,171680,"There's also a lot of cleaning, a lot of plumbing."
18fwz9Itbvo,171680,173829,So you have to be ready to wear a lot of hats
18fwz9Itbvo,173830,175690,if you wanna be a brewmaster.
18fwz9Itbvo,175690,179107,"So @YoffYackson asked, ""How do you become a brewmaster,"
18fwz9Itbvo,179107,181452,"""because I feel that's an awesome job?"
18fwz9Itbvo,181453,183320,"""#dreamjob."""
18fwz9Itbvo,183320,186800,The brewmaster is essentially the chef of the brewery.
18fwz9Itbvo,186800,189880,There are two main ways you can learn to be a brewmaster.
18fwz9Itbvo,189880,193440,"One is you take classes, sometimes for years,"
18fwz9Itbvo,193440,195240,"or you can do it the old-fashioned way,"
18fwz9Itbvo,195240,196420,which is the apprenticeship.
18fwz9Itbvo,196420,200240,"You basically attach yourself to another brewmaster,"
18fwz9Itbvo,200240,203470,"usually for years, and you slowly learn on the job."
18fwz9Itbvo,203470,206580,"There are many, many jobs in each brewery,"
18fwz9Itbvo,206580,209480,"but in each brewery there's only one brewmaster,"
18fwz9Itbvo,209480,212420,"the same way that there are a lot of cooks in a kitchen,"
18fwz9Itbvo,212420,214207,but there's only one chef.

18fwz9Itbvo,221910,224750,I don't think that would make me very frisky.
18fwz9Itbvo,224750,228540,I prefer my Guinness and peanuts separately.
18fwz9Itbvo,228540,230439,"I don't know why you'd wanna put them in a blender,"
18fwz9Itbvo,230440,234120,but Guinness does have a reputation in the Caribbean
18fwz9Itbvo,234120,238099,and in Africa for giving people extra potency.
18fwz9Itbvo,238100,239900,I don't know if there's any truth to this.
18fwz9Itbvo,239900,241620,I just think it tastes pretty good.
18fwz9Itbvo,241620,244989,"But there is a thing, especially with the stronger versions,"
18fwz9Itbvo,244990,248540,"the Guinness Foreign Extra Stout at about 8%,"
18fwz9Itbvo,248540,250610,that's supposed to be really good for you.
18fwz9Itbvo,250610,252290,They think that it's an aphrodisiac
18fwz9Itbvo,252290,254870,and it's gonna give them special powers.
18fwz9Itbvo,254870,255702,I'm not sure.

18fwz9Itbvo,261630,263530,"No, but it was."
18fwz9Itbvo,263530,266160,"So after prohibition, people were really worried"
18fwz9Itbvo,266160,267690,that there were gonna be all these people
18fwz9Itbvo,267690,271110,fermenting at home and they were not gonna be paying taxes.
18fwz9Itbvo,271110,273680,"My grandfather was one of them during prohibition,"
18fwz9Itbvo,273680,275276,who was making his own beer at home.
18fwz9Itbvo,275277,279820,"In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter signed legislation"
18fwz9Itbvo,279820,282640,making home brewing legal in the United States.
18fwz9Itbvo,282640,284100,You can brew your own beer at home
18fwz9Itbvo,284100,286280,and you can drink it and you can bring it to your friends.
18fwz9Itbvo,286280,288040,The thing you can't do is sell it.
18fwz9Itbvo,288040,291360,"You gotta pay taxes, you need licenses, etc., etc."
18fwz9Itbvo,291360,294240,"So yes, you can brew legally at home,"
18fwz9Itbvo,294240,296317,"but no, you can't sell it to all your pals."

18fwz9Itbvo,305300,307840,You need to hold the pressure in your container

18fwz9Itbvo,316720,319770,"You can get a box mix, just add water, just add milk."
18fwz9Itbvo,319770,321910,Or you can make pancakes from scratch.
18fwz9Itbvo,321910,323580,Kinda the same thing with beer.
18fwz9Itbvo,323580,325180,"You can start off with a kit,"
18fwz9Itbvo,325180,327250,"but if you wanna have more control,"
18fwz9Itbvo,327250,329980,you're gonna start here with the original grains.
18fwz9Itbvo,329980,331350,You're going to crush them.
18fwz9Itbvo,331350,334700,"You mix them with hot water at very specific temperatures,"
18fwz9Itbvo,334700,336490,about 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
18fwz9Itbvo,336490,337729,Activate the enzymes.
18fwz9Itbvo,337730,340780,You're gonna break all those starches down into sugars.
18fwz9Itbvo,340780,342860,You're gonna strain those sugars out.
18fwz9Itbvo,342860,344349,Bring it to a boil.
18fwz9Itbvo,344350,347230,"Now you have a liquid called the wort, W-O-R-T."
18fwz9Itbvo,347230,348410,You bring that to a boil.
18fwz9Itbvo,348410,349600,You add your hops.
18fwz9Itbvo,349600,352770,You cool the whole thing down and you add the yeast.
18fwz9Itbvo,352770,355389,"The yeast, then it's going to eat the sugars,"
18fwz9Itbvo,355390,358680,"give off carbon dioxide, give off flavors"
18fwz9Itbvo,358680,360759,"and give off, of course, alcohol."
18fwz9Itbvo,360760,362700,"Within a few days, you've got beer."
18fwz9Itbvo,362700,365360,I was an amateur brewer for years.
18fwz9Itbvo,365360,366580,We're going way back.
18fwz9Itbvo,366580,368330,I am 400 years old.
18fwz9Itbvo,368330,370460,I didn't like the offering of beer that we had
18fwz9Itbvo,370460,372130,in the mid-80s at that time.
18fwz9Itbvo,372130,374830,So I started making my own beer at home

18fwz9Itbvo,396380,398320,"outside of Cape Town, South Africa."
18fwz9Itbvo,398320,399690,And it was sour.
18fwz9Itbvo,399690,400980,It was funky.
18fwz9Itbvo,400980,402940,It had all sorts of stuff going on.
18fwz9Itbvo,402940,404440,"It was made from sorghum,"
18fwz9Itbvo,404440,406410,but this is a really traditional beer style.
18fwz9Itbvo,406410,409670,"Beer was invented probably about 10,000 years ago."
18fwz9Itbvo,409670,413360,"By the time you got to Ancient Egypt, they had everything."
18fwz9Itbvo,413360,417500,"They had beer styles, they had names, they had advertising."
18fwz9Itbvo,417500,419080,Old Egyptian cities like Thebes
18fwz9Itbvo,419080,421080,were actually built on beer money.
18fwz9Itbvo,421080,423360,The pyramids were built on beer money.
18fwz9Itbvo,423360,425129,"So beer goes way, way back,"

18fwz9Itbvo,448990,451340,"So if you wanted to buy a canner,"
18fwz9Itbvo,451340,453570,it cost over $1 million.

18fwz9Itbvo,498900,500639,And that is one way in which a can

18fwz9Itbvo,564510,567720,Yeast is one of the most important elements in beer.
18fwz9Itbvo,567720,569500,It is the agent that actually takes
18fwz9Itbvo,569500,571540,this sweet liquid called wort
18fwz9Itbvo,571540,574980,"and transforms it, almost magically, into beer."
18fwz9Itbvo,574980,576839,And there are various types of yeast.
18fwz9Itbvo,576840,578400,The main one that we're using in beer
18fwz9Itbvo,578400,581060,"is called saccharomyces, and saccharomyces"
18fwz9Itbvo,581060,583910,means the sugar yeast or the sugar fungus.
18fwz9Itbvo,583910,586069,"It consumes sugar, gives off alcohol."
18fwz9Itbvo,586070,588980,And that's the thing that it does.
18fwz9Itbvo,588980,591000,"It does it everywhere in the natural world,"
18fwz9Itbvo,591000,592020,including in our beer.
18fwz9Itbvo,592020,595410,"But when you add the yeast, it starts to reproduce,"
18fwz9Itbvo,595410,597029,and it reproduces by budding.
18fwz9Itbvo,597030,598920,So you have like one yeast cell here
18fwz9Itbvo,598920,600610,and another one starts to grow out of it.
18fwz9Itbvo,600610,602600,And this happens over and over again
18fwz9Itbvo,602600,604959,until you have a full population of yeast.
18fwz9Itbvo,604960,607220,"Now, when the fermentation is finished,"
18fwz9Itbvo,607220,609160,usually we'll cool the tank down
18fwz9Itbvo,609160,611110,and the yeast will drop to the bottom.
18fwz9Itbvo,611110,613839,"At that point, you can remove the yeast"
18fwz9Itbvo,613840,616480,and store it for later use.
18fwz9Itbvo,616480,618000,"You can't store it forever,"
18fwz9Itbvo,618000,620180,but you can easily store it for a week or more.
