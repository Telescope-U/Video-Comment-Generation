PkiG_R2FOGA,2797680,2805119,not feel too good you usually only eat  small things  i've worked out your problem whale shark
PkiG_R2FOGA,2805119,2811520,you don't have measles or chickenpox  you have octonauts
PkiG_R2FOGA,2820960,2828400,we seem to have landed somewhere is that  you making that clicking sound i thought  it was you making the clicking sound
PkiG_R2FOGA,2828400,2834560,i'm going to remove the shell for you  we'll just cut it open and stop  please stop
PkiG_R2FOGA,2834560,2841200,oh hello  stop why  listen i'm almost too big for the shell
PkiG_R2FOGA,2841200,2846319,i'm in i need a new one and that shell  is just right just right it may be too
PkiG_R2FOGA,2846319,2852480,small for him but it's the perfect size  for me he's not the only hermit crab  around here you know
PkiG_R2FOGA,2852480,2857920,oh well let's get on with it if you cut  that shell in off it'll be ruined ruined
PkiG_R2FOGA,2857920,2863839,i'll never find another one like it and  believe me i've looked if you don't mind  my asking
PkiG_R2FOGA,2863839,2871200,why do you keep changing shells anyway  oh because hermit crabs can't grow their  own shells so we borrow the shells of
PkiG_R2FOGA,2871200,2876319,other animals for protection we move  into one shell grow up get bigger and
PkiG_R2FOGA,2876319,2881760,then move to a bigger shell  so what can we do tweak
PkiG_R2FOGA,2881760,2887760,maybe i could just cut off the shell and  then try to glue it back together
PkiG_R2FOGA,2887760,2892720,that's too risky i think we need a new  plan
PkiG_R2FOGA,2893359,2899760,captain we have one hermit crab who  needs to get out of his shell and  another who wants to get in we have to
PkiG_R2FOGA,2899760,2904960,safely remove the crab from its shell  there's only one thing to do peso we
