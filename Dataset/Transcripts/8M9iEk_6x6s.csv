8M9iEk_6x6s,335840,338000,and the brewers lead nine to three i
8M9iEk_6x6s,338000,339600,think if chapman is able to pick that
8M9iEk_6x6s,339600,341280,cleanly he's gonna be able to turn two
8M9iEk_6x6s,341280,342639,it was hit hard

8M9iEk_6x6s,373120,377039,urias with an rbi makes it 10-3
8M9iEk_6x6s,377039,379039,that's line over to the shortstop played
8M9iEk_6x6s,379039,381039,on the short hop by bechet he'll go to
8M9iEk_6x6s,381039,383199,second for one easy turn to first in
8M9iEk_6x6s,383199,385759,time arvayas hit into a sharp inning
