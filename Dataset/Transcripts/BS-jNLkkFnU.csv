BS-jNLkkFnU,80,2560,so samsung has already spaffed out its s
BS-jNLkkFnU,2560,4400,series flagships for the year and next
BS-jNLkkFnU,4400,6080,up is the more affordable but still
BS-jNLkkFnU,6080,8080,surprisingly bloody good air series
BS-jNLkkFnU,8080,10240,handsets headlined by this here colorful
BS-jNLkkFnU,10240,14080,wii beauty the samsung galaxy a53 5g
BS-jNLkkFnU,14080,16160,boston improved camera tech beefier
BS-jNLkkFnU,16160,17440,performance and a handful of other
BS-jNLkkFnU,17440,20000,upgrades versus the older a52 series
BS-jNLkkFnU,20000,22640,handsets the a53 looks like one of the
BS-jNLkkFnU,22640,25439,best mid-range mobiles coming up in 2022
BS-jNLkkFnU,25439,26880,and frankly a much more enticing
BS-jNLkkFnU,26880,28800,offering than that their iphone se
BS-jNLkkFnU,28800,30720,unless you really heavily dig the
BS-jNLkkFnU,30720,33520,extreme retro nostalgia vibes the
BS-jNLkkFnU,33520,37440,samsung a53 5g will cost you 399 quid
BS-jNLkkFnU,37440,39760,here in the uk and it is hit in stores
BS-jNLkkFnU,39760,41360,soon i'm shooting this video ahead of
BS-jNLkkFnU,41360,43200,the official launch but hopefully by the
BS-jNLkkFnU,43200,45360,time this video hits your peepers i'll
BS-jNLkkFnU,45360,47120,have an actual release date so i'll bang
BS-jNLkkFnU,47120,48640,that down in the video description down
BS-jNLkkFnU,48640,50800,below but anyway here's my full samsung
BS-jNLkkFnU,50800,53199,galaxy a53 hands-on review and for more
BS-jNLkkFnU,53199,54559,than it's a great secret please do press
BS-jNLkkFnU,54559,56640,subscribe ending that notifications bell
BS-jNLkkFnU,56640,58640,cheers now first up the design doesn't
BS-jNLkkFnU,58640,60399,really look too different to last year's
BS-jNLkkFnU,60399,64400,a52 and a52s but the galaxy a53 is
BS-jNLkkFnU,64400,66400,slightly skinnier than those older
BS-jNLkkFnU,66400,68640,models although at 6.5 inches it is
BS-jNLkkFnU,68640,70880,still a proper handful and a half even
BS-jNLkkFnU,70880,72960,with those lovely slender bezels it
BS-jNLkkFnU,72960,75280,weighs in at just 189 grams which ain't
BS-jNLkkFnU,75280,78720,too bad at all for a big old 6.5 incher
BS-jNLkkFnU,78720,80720,and thanks to the pleasingly curvy
BS-jNLkkFnU,80720,82880,corners and edges it is a comfortable
BS-jNLkkFnU,82880,84720,clutch you've got a choice of four
BS-jNLkkFnU,84720,86560,colors here and once again samsung has
BS-jNLkkFnU,86560,88240,been super modest with its name and
BS-jNLkkFnU,88240,90720,conventions gone with awesome black
BS-jNLkkFnU,90720,93360,awesome white awesome blue and awesome
BS-jNLkkFnU,93360,95280,peach the blue and peach are definitely
BS-jNLkkFnU,95280,96799,my personal favorites because i just
BS-jNLkkFnU,96799,98799,love a bit of color on my smartphones
BS-jNLkkFnU,98799,100640,they're quite subtle though with their
BS-jNLkkFnU,100640,102720,shades they're not full on in your face
BS-jNLkkFnU,102720,103840,like bruh
BS-jNLkkFnU,103840,105439,and yeah i wouldn't say i exactly
BS-jNLkkFnU,105439,107759,dropped to my knees in awe at the sight
BS-jNLkkFnU,107759,110079,of them but they are rather lovely
BS-jNLkkFnU,110079,111600,rather lovely peach doesn't have quite
BS-jNLkkFnU,111600,113280,the same ring though i guess that back
BS-jNLkkFnU,113280,114960,end is once again constructed from
BS-jNLkkFnU,114960,116479,plastic with a matte finish so it
BS-jNLkkFnU,116479,118640,doesn't get all smudgy and disgusting
BS-jNLkkFnU,118640,120159,even when you're sweating up a storm
BS-jNLkkFnU,120159,122799,under some pretty fierce spotlights and
BS-jNLkkFnU,122799,124399,you've got gorilla glass 5 up front to
BS-jNLkkFnU,124399,126320,help keep scratches at bay should
BS-jNLkkFnU,126320,127680,hopefully do the job nicely and you've
BS-jNLkkFnU,127680,130319,also got full ip67 water and dust
BS-jNLkkFnU,130319,132080,resistance as well so no worries if you
BS-jNLkkFnU,132080,134879,accidentally drop the a535g in a bathtub
BS-jNLkkFnU,134879,136959,in the sink whatever it should survive
BS-jNLkkFnU,136959,139360,absolutely fine so let's move on to the
BS-jNLkkFnU,139360,141440,software side and this semi-blur once
BS-jNLkkFnU,141440,143520,again serves up that android 12 and one
BS-jNLkkFnU,143520,145840,ui 4.1 experience the same as those
BS-jNLkkFnU,145840,148480,wallet draining s series flagships this
BS-jNLkkFnU,148480,150160,includes all the sami apps we know and
BS-jNLkkFnU,150160,152160,love such as health and smart things
BS-jNLkkFnU,152160,154319,plus all of my favorite bonus sammy bits
BS-jNLkkFnU,154319,157200,like bixby routines samsung's knox
BS-jNLkkFnU,157200,159120,security suite is once again on hand to
BS-jNLkkFnU,159120,160560,protect your privates where you've got
BS-jNLkkFnU,160560,162720,an in-display optical fingerprint sensor
BS-jNLkkFnU,162720,164319,and face recognition as well so you
BS-jNLkkFnU,164319,166000,don't have to go through the laborious
BS-jNLkkFnU,166000,168000,motions of poking in a pin every time
BS-jNLkkFnU,168000,170560,storage is set at 120 gigs pretty
BS-jNLkkFnU,170560,172000,generous that's double the amount you'll
BS-jNLkkFnU,172000,175680,get in the iphone se 2022 and yes glory
BS-jNLkkFnU,175680,178080,be there is micro sd support as well
BS-jNLkkFnU,178080,180239,cards up to one terabyte in size can be
BS-jNLkkFnU,180239,183040,slipped inside of the galaxy a535g to
BS-jNLkkFnU,183040,185280,expand that storage now samsung's a
BS-jNLkkFnU,185280,187120,series blowers usually don't disappoint
BS-jNLkkFnU,187120,188879,when it comes to the display tech and i
BS-jNLkkFnU,188879,190879,was pleased to see another stun and
BS-jNLkkFnU,190879,192720,super amoled screen shoved onto the
BS-jNLkkFnU,192720,196080,galaxy a53 this 6.5 inch panel offers up
BS-jNLkkFnU,196080,197920,the same full hd plus resolution as the
BS-jNLkkFnU,197920,200560,previous generation so visuals are bold
BS-jNLkkFnU,200560,202159,and crisp with the option of tweaking
BS-jNLkkFnU,202159,204239,the tones so they're either super vivid
BS-jNLkkFnU,204239,206400,or a bit more subdued and once again
BS-jNLkkFnU,206400,209040,that infinity or sphincter only intrudes
BS-jNLkkFnU,209040,210480,a little bit on the action when you go
BS-jNLkkFnU,210480,212879,full screen as it is impressively dinky
BS-jNLkkFnU,212879,214879,brightness tops off at 800 nits now and
BS-jNLkkFnU,214879,216799,even under those red hot lights i was
BS-jNLkkFnU,216799,218879,not bothered by reflections and once
BS-jNLkkFnU,218879,221360,again this mighty screen peaks at a 120
BS-jNLkkFnU,221360,223200,hertz refresh rate as well so when it's
BS-jNLkkFnU,223200,224799,a smooth operator whether you're
BS-jNLkkFnU,224799,227360,skimming through one ui or whatever else
BS-jNLkkFnU,227360,230319,the galaxy a53 stereo speaker setup is
BS-jNLkkFnU,230319,232239,again impressive for this price point it
BS-jNLkkFnU,232239,233599,certainly seems louder than before
BS-jNLkkFnU,233599,235040,that's for sure where you've got all the
BS-jNLkkFnU,235040,236720,usual features packed in there including
BS-jNLkkFnU,236720,238560,dolby atmos support but is there a
BS-jNLkkFnU,238560,241680,headphone jack sadly not here on the a53
BS-jNLkkFnU,241680,243599,as well so that is a bit of a
BS-jNLkkFnU,243599,246400,disappointment now the galaxy a53 is
BS-jNLkkFnU,246400,248080,powered by samsung's fresh new five
BS-jNLkkFnU,248080,250720,nanometer exynos 1280 chipset and
BS-jNLkkFnU,250720,252560,samsung has promised a massive leap in
BS-jNLkkFnU,252560,255040,gpu performance versus the previous
BS-jNLkkFnU,255040,256720,generation now it's something i haven't
BS-jNLkkFnU,256720,257919,been able to test out unfortunately in
BS-jNLkkFnU,257919,259919,my hands-on session with this galaxy
BS-jNLkkFnU,259919,261680,blur but certainly when i get my review
BS-jNLkkFnU,261680,263440,unit in i will be raking it across the
BS-jNLkkFnU,263440,265360,course with a solid bit of gentian
BS-jNLkkFnU,265360,267520,impact action and yes the 1280 comes
BS-jNLkkFnU,267520,270000,packing a 5g modem as well so yes you've
BS-jNLkkFnU,270000,272560,got 5g support as suggested by the 5g
BS-jNLkkFnU,272560,276479,bit of the name samsung galaxy a53 5g
BS-jNLkkFnU,276479,278240,samsung has also upgraded the battery
BS-jNLkkFnU,278240,281040,here versus the older a52 and the a52s
BS-jNLkkFnU,281040,283360,with a 5 000 milliamp capacity cell now
BS-jNLkkFnU,283360,285919,crammed inside so you can expect all-day
BS-jNLkkFnU,285919,288160,player especially if the 1280 proves as
BS-jNLkkFnU,288160,291040,energy efficient as other exynos socs
BS-jNLkkFnU,291040,293840,this does support 25 watt wide charging
BS-jNLkkFnU,293840,295360,a bit lethargic compared with some of
BS-jNLkkFnU,295360,297120,the competition and i don't actually
BS-jNLkkFnU,297120,299280,think you get a 25 watt adapter bundled
BS-jNLkkFnU,299280,301360,in the box either though obviously i'll
BS-jNLkkFnU,301360,303120,have to wait for my actual retail box to
BS-jNLkkFnU,303120,305520,confirm uh that for sure i know there's
BS-jNLkkFnU,305520,307280,no wireless charging support here either
BS-jNLkkFnU,307280,308800,but that's a pretty rare feature for
BS-jNLkkFnU,308800,311520,under 400 quid anyway now finally the
BS-jNLkkFnU,311520,313360,camera tech and it is a respectable
BS-jNLkkFnU,313360,316320,mid-range setup on the a535g headed up
BS-jNLkkFnU,316320,318639,by a 64 meg primary shooter with
BS-jNLkkFnU,318639,321199,built-in optical image stabilization you
BS-jNLkkFnU,321199,322960,also have a 12 megapixel ultra wide
BS-jNLkkFnU,322960,324560,angle lens while the last two are your
BS-jNLkkFnU,324560,327280,basic depth and macro efforts that ui
BS-jNLkkFnU,327280,328960,will be very familiar to any samsung
BS-jNLkkFnU,328960,331120,fans out there densely packed with tools
BS-jNLkkFnU,331120,332880,and toggles while samsung has choked
BS-jNLkkFnU,332880,334880,bloody loads of bonus mods on here as
BS-jNLkkFnU,334880,336720,usual so for instance you've got that
BS-jNLkkFnU,336720,338400,advanced portrait mode with a bit of
BS-jNLkkFnU,338400,340560,scalable bokeh action you've got a
BS-jNLkkFnU,340560,342320,dedicated night mode you've got that
BS-jNLkkFnU,342320,344080,excellent single take mode which as
BS-jNLkkFnU,344080,346080,always is a godsend if you've got kids
BS-jNLkkFnU,346080,347840,or pets and you can't make your mind up
BS-jNLkkFnU,347840,349840,on whether to shoot photos videos
BS-jNLkkFnU,349840,352479,portrait snaps whatever else and yes
BS-jNLkkFnU,352479,354400,there is unfortunately the usual er
BS-jNLkkFnU,354400,356160,bollocks if you really want to demean
BS-jNLkkFnU,356160,358639,yourself and your family members just
BS-jNLkkFnU,358639,361039,just kill it just kill it with fire as
BS-jNLkkFnU,361039,362880,for your video chops well i'm expecting
BS-jNLkkFnU,362880,364800,good results out of the a53 you can
BS-jNLkkFnU,364800,366960,shoot up to 4k resolution footage at 30
BS-jNLkkFnU,366960,369120,frames per second or keep it at full hd
BS-jNLkkFnU,369120,372319,res at either 30 or 60 fps and then last
BS-jNLkkFnU,372319,374720,up up front in that sphincter cutout is
BS-jNLkkFnU,374720,376800,a 32 megapixel selfie snapper which
BS-jNLkkFnU,376800,378240,should prove a good end for your
BS-jNLkkFnU,378240,380479,instagram needs so that in a nutshell is
BS-jNLkkFnU,380479,383840,the fresh new samsung galaxy a53 5g
BS-jNLkkFnU,383840,386000,mid-range mobile and yeah it's not a
BS-jNLkkFnU,386000,389199,massive evolution of the ear52 s5g which
BS-jNLkkFnU,389199,391199,i reviewed last year but you know what
BS-jNLkkFnU,391199,392479,that's absolutely fine because that's
BS-jNLkkFnU,392479,394240,still one of the best mid-range mobiles
BS-jNLkkFnU,394240,396240,right now you've got a massive bloody
BS-jNLkkFnU,396240,398720,battery in there looks like a fantastic
BS-jNLkkFnU,398720,400400,screen certainly could get well on board
BS-jNLkkFnU,400400,401600,with enjoying a good bit of netflix
BS-jNLkkFnU,401600,402960,youtube and all that shenanigans on
BS-jNLkkFnU,402960,404720,there the camera tech as long as samsung
BS-jNLkkFnU,404720,406560,hasn't spunk that one up the wall then
BS-jNLkkFnU,406560,408240,should prove very good for your everyday
BS-jNLkkFnU,408240,410720,pixel movies so definitely if you want a
BS-jNLkkFnU,410720,412720,solid or on smartphone for around 400
BS-jNLkkFnU,412720,415360,quid this looks like it could be a good
BS-jNLkkFnU,415360,416880,option but of course i'm going to
BS-jNLkkFnU,416880,418319,reserve all judgement until i finally
BS-jNLkkFnU,418319,420479,get my mitts on the retail model and
BS-jNLkkFnU,420479,422240,give it a full on testing out using
BS-jNLkkFnU,422240,423360,that's my full-time smartphone for
BS-jNLkkFnU,423360,424800,around a week or so so stay tuned for
BS-jNLkkFnU,424800,426080,that review if you don't want to miss
