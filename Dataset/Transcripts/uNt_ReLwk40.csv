uNt_ReLwk40,250,3480,"- Windows on Steam Deck, it's here."
uNt_ReLwk40,3480,6330,"On Thursday, Valve released the drivers that we needed"
uNt_ReLwk40,6330,9120,to run the operating system that they have spent years
uNt_ReLwk40,9120,11680,trying to make sure we won't need.
uNt_ReLwk40,11680,15670,"Linux users have literally begged us not to do this,"
uNt_ReLwk40,15670,17660,or at least not to recommend it.
uNt_ReLwk40,17660,20369,But they forgot one simple fact.
uNt_ReLwk40,20370,21810,I own this device.
uNt_ReLwk40,21810,22970,It's mine.
uNt_ReLwk40,22970,24970,"So whatever I do, what I want."
uNt_ReLwk40,24970,27349,"And besides, even I don't know"
uNt_ReLwk40,27350,29050,if I would recommend this yet.
uNt_ReLwk40,29050,32259,"What I would recommend is our sponsor, Build Redux."
uNt_ReLwk40,32259,34230,Build Redux offers competitive pricing
uNt_ReLwk40,34230,35820,compared to building a PC yourself.
uNt_ReLwk40,35820,37900,"Their website makes it easy to configure your build,"
uNt_ReLwk40,37900,39780,alongside their helpful support guides.
uNt_ReLwk40,39780,42210,So head to buildredux.com/linus
uNt_ReLwk40,42210,44280,and start creating your PC today.
uNt_ReLwk40,44280,46199,"We will talk about how we got to this point,"
uNt_ReLwk40,46200,47470,but I don't wanna keep you guys waiting
uNt_ReLwk40,47470,51100,"and I'm gonna dive right in, starting with desktop controls."
uNt_ReLwk40,51100,53379,You can use either the right joystick
uNt_ReLwk40,53380,57280,or the right track pad to move the mouse cursor around.
uNt_ReLwk40,57280,59059,"And I gotta say right outta the gate,"
uNt_ReLwk40,59060,61680,having this track pad here compared to something
uNt_ReLwk40,61680,65210,"like the joy X off on the in Aya Neo,"
uNt_ReLwk40,65210,67500,"wow, Is that ever a lot better."
uNt_ReLwk40,67500,70153,"But there's one thing I immediately noticed missing,"
uNt_ReLwk40,71170,72272,push to tap.
uNt_ReLwk40,73370,75160,How is that not a thing?
uNt_ReLwk40,75160,79320,"No, instead, and this is sort of intuitive."
uNt_ReLwk40,79320,83130,"You actually use the right trigger for a left click,"
uNt_ReLwk40,83130,85909,and the left trigger for right click.
uNt_ReLwk40,85910,88060,"Pretty much every other handheld I've seen,"
uNt_ReLwk40,88060,89680,defaults the other way around.
uNt_ReLwk40,89680,91280,"Left is left, right is right."
uNt_ReLwk40,91280,94130,But it seems like Valve is of the mind that
uNt_ReLwk40,94130,96430,the dominant hand should be the one
uNt_ReLwk40,96430,99580,that is the most often clicked.
uNt_ReLwk40,99580,101100,Okay. How do I scroll down the page out?
uNt_ReLwk40,101100,101933,It's probably left.
uNt_ReLwk40,101933,102766,"Yeah, there we go."
uNt_ReLwk40,102766,104702,Left analog stick.
uNt_ReLwk40,104703,107460,Okay. We just brought up an on-screen keyboard
uNt_ReLwk40,107460,109320,by pushing down on the DPAD.
uNt_ReLwk40,109320,110690,I'm gonna close Steam for now.
uNt_ReLwk40,110690,112170,We can use the touch screen as well.
uNt_ReLwk40,112170,113820,I guess that's worth mentioning.
uNt_ReLwk40,113820,115090,Oh wait.
uNt_ReLwk40,115090,118420,"No, you need Steam running in order to wait."
uNt_ReLwk40,118420,121070,Nope. My mouse cursor's back.
uNt_ReLwk40,121070,123140,The right joystick doesn't work for it anymore though.
uNt_ReLwk40,123140,124740,Only the track pad does.
uNt_ReLwk40,124740,126329,"Basically, there's two control schemes."
uNt_ReLwk40,126330,128259,"There's the Windows default, which allows you to use"
uNt_ReLwk40,128259,129909,this as a track pad and yeah.
uNt_ReLwk40,129910,132650,"Is still right to left and left, right."
uNt_ReLwk40,132650,135519,"Or if you have Steam launched, it'll actually"
uNt_ReLwk40,135520,138340,treat the entire controller as a Steam controller
uNt_ReLwk40,138340,141069,and you can use the joystick to control the mouse as well.
uNt_ReLwk40,141070,142480,"Now that I've got Steam launched again,"
uNt_ReLwk40,142480,144230,let's try to launch an application.
uNt_ReLwk40,145870,147489,"Okay, is it?"
uNt_ReLwk40,147490,149550,I've seen this on other handhelds as well.
uNt_ReLwk40,149550,152870,"For whatever reason, UAC prompts disable"
uNt_ReLwk40,152870,156750,whatever software is allowing you to joystick to mouse.
uNt_ReLwk40,156750,158050,"On the Steam Deck though,"
uNt_ReLwk40,158050,159580,"at least you can still use the, okay,"
uNt_ReLwk40,159580,162570,"I swear, the touchpad worked a second to go."
uNt_ReLwk40,162570,163960,Now it's not working.
uNt_ReLwk40,163960,166430,"To be clear, a lot of these annoyances"
uNt_ReLwk40,166430,168010,are kind of universal.
uNt_ReLwk40,168010,169189,Whenever you're trying to use Windows
uNt_ReLwk40,169190,173270,"on a handheld device, it's just very imperfect experience."
uNt_ReLwk40,173270,174930,Let's have a look at how this SOC appears
uNt_ReLwk40,174930,176900,"in CPU-Z, since we've got it."
uNt_ReLwk40,176900,180090,"AMD Ryzen, we don't know exactly what kind."
uNt_ReLwk40,180090,182300,Custom APU 0405.
uNt_ReLwk40,182300,183340,Super cool.
uNt_ReLwk40,183340,186840,Nope. Does not know that this is LPDDR5.
uNt_ReLwk40,186840,188683,"All right then, how about GPU-Z?"
uNt_ReLwk40,189980,193450,"Same thing, has no idea what to make of this mess."
uNt_ReLwk40,193450,195410,"GPU clock, zero megahertz."
uNt_ReLwk40,195410,198520,"Custom APU 0405, fair enough."
uNt_ReLwk40,198520,200910,"GPU, custom GPU 0405"
uNt_ReLwk40,200910,202480,Picks up the memory speed at least.
uNt_ReLwk40,202480,204150,Doesn't seem to indicate in any way
uNt_ReLwk40,204150,207780,that this memory is shared between the GPU and CPU.
uNt_ReLwk40,207780,210440,Although it does note that 1.2 gigabytes of it
uNt_ReLwk40,210440,212660,"is hardware reserved, which would be"
uNt_ReLwk40,212660,214540,what's reserved for our GPU.
uNt_ReLwk40,214540,215670,Wifi works.
uNt_ReLwk40,215670,216930,Bluetooth appears to be here.
uNt_ReLwk40,216930,218599,"Actually, I should fire up device manager."
uNt_ReLwk40,218600,222200,Clearly all the drivers are not working yet.
uNt_ReLwk40,222200,225959,"Unknown devices, multimedia controller."
uNt_ReLwk40,225960,228470,Multimedia controller would be the onboard audio.
uNt_ReLwk40,228470,230760,So the 3.5 millimeter jack
uNt_ReLwk40,230760,233040,and the speakers do not work.
uNt_ReLwk40,233040,234099,"So you can use Bluetooth,"
uNt_ReLwk40,234100,237343,"or you can use a Type-C to headphone adapter, for now."
uNt_ReLwk40,238210,239560,I think we should launch a game.
uNt_ReLwk40,239560,241640,"And of course, we have a second Steam Deck."
uNt_ReLwk40,241640,243970,I can already tell that this is running
uNt_ReLwk40,243970,248010,like absolute dog poo on Windows compared to Linux.
uNt_ReLwk40,248010,249420,It's not even close.
uNt_ReLwk40,249420,252360,It's not even just that the FPS is lower.
uNt_ReLwk40,252360,255110,It's just a difference in responsiveness
uNt_ReLwk40,255110,257290,and like stutterinesss.
uNt_ReLwk40,257290,260109,Super unresponsive.
uNt_ReLwk40,260109,261669,"- [Anthony] Funny while I was testing this,"
uNt_ReLwk40,261670,263960,"with the haptics going, I thought that the speaker"
uNt_ReLwk40,263960,265410,was going for some reason.
uNt_ReLwk40,265410,266243,- Yeah.
uNt_ReLwk40,266243,267500,- [Anthony] Because the haptics are so weak.
uNt_ReLwk40,267500,270180,"- The haptics are, well, there's no haptics."
uNt_ReLwk40,270180,273330,It's just the vibration in the touch pads.
uNt_ReLwk40,273330,274163,- [Anthony] Yeah.
uNt_ReLwk40,274163,276710,"- So they've tuned that in Linux, so it doesn't feel"
uNt_ReLwk40,276710,280630,"so like kind of cheap and ugly sounding,"
uNt_ReLwk40,280630,282500,"but in Windows, clearly, that same tuning"
uNt_ReLwk40,282500,283820,hasn't taken place.
uNt_ReLwk40,283820,284780,"Well, how about on Windows?"
uNt_ReLwk40,284780,287430,What does the Steam button and the overlay button do?
uNt_ReLwk40,288440,289960,Big fat load and nothing.
uNt_ReLwk40,289960,291300,- [Anthony] I mean the Steam button
uNt_ReLwk40,291300,294430,"should pull up the Steam overlay or something, but..."
uNt_ReLwk40,295540,296510,"- Oh, oh, it does."
uNt_ReLwk40,296510,297960,It does. It pulls up the Steam Overlay
uNt_ReLwk40,297960,299870,which does allow me to exit the game.
uNt_ReLwk40,299870,301660,So it's just the quick access menu button
uNt_ReLwk40,301660,302570,that doesn't do anything.
uNt_ReLwk40,302570,304440,Okay. That's good.
uNt_ReLwk40,304440,308180,Obviously it's a less comprehensive Steam Overlay.
uNt_ReLwk40,308180,309210,Let's try something else.
uNt_ReLwk40,309210,311160,I have not played Elden Ring yet.
uNt_ReLwk40,311160,313130,"So far, launch time looks pretty similar."
uNt_ReLwk40,313130,315230,"I started the Windows once, lately before."
uNt_ReLwk40,316490,318900,that's a solid Linux win right there.
uNt_ReLwk40,318900,320509,- [Anthony] That doesn't look right on the Windows side.
uNt_ReLwk40,320510,321343,"- [Linus] No, it really doesn't."
uNt_ReLwk40,321343,322800,"- [Anthony] When I testing it earlier,"
uNt_ReLwk40,322800,324770,the loading screens are only 16 by nine.
uNt_ReLwk40,324770,328009,"So the actual background, like the game assets loading in"
uNt_ReLwk40,328010,329310,could be seen in the seams
uNt_ReLwk40,329310,330630,at the top and bottom of the screen.
uNt_ReLwk40,330630,331700,- Oh hilarious.
uNt_ReLwk40,331700,332930,Let's try Borderless Windowed.
uNt_ReLwk40,332930,335900,I've had better luck with GOG and some kit.
uNt_ReLwk40,335900,337341,What? Hello?
uNt_ReLwk40,337342,338990,Weird.
uNt_ReLwk40,338990,340130,"Oh. - [Anthony] Oh, Hey."
uNt_ReLwk40,340130,341030,"- Hey, we're back."
uNt_ReLwk40,341030,343060,Time to not mess with that again.
uNt_ReLwk40,343060,344280,I'm loading up a new game here
uNt_ReLwk40,344280,347550,because we did all the benchmarking on this Steam account
uNt_ReLwk40,347550,349710,"where we're actually a little bit into the game,"
uNt_ReLwk40,349710,351560,but I wanted to be able to play them
uNt_ReLwk40,351560,352840,side by side with you guys.
uNt_ReLwk40,352840,354607,"So, we got a new account for the Linux machine"
uNt_ReLwk40,354607,356090,and we wanted to be able
uNt_ReLwk40,356090,358240,to just switch back and forth between them.
uNt_ReLwk40,360270,364110,Okay. Wow. Big Picture has work to do.
uNt_ReLwk40,364110,366039,"I mean, Valve has said, that they're going"
uNt_ReLwk40,366040,370560,"to adapt Big Picture based on the SteamOS,"
uNt_ReLwk40,370560,372000,Steam Deck Interface.
uNt_ReLwk40,372000,373563,"Like this, oh man."
uNt_ReLwk40,374780,375720,Night and day.
uNt_ReLwk40,375720,377280,So much better.
uNt_ReLwk40,377280,378113,- [Anthony] There it is.
uNt_ReLwk40,378113,379180,You can see the seams.
uNt_ReLwk40,379180,380360,- [Linus] Oh that's weird.
uNt_ReLwk40,380360,382849,- [Anthony] This is a famously bad port.
uNt_ReLwk40,382850,385623,- Linux for the win for loading times again.
uNt_ReLwk40,386900,388889,- [Anthony] Wow. His Windows really that far behind?
uNt_ReLwk40,388890,390680,- Oh shoot. I didn't open frame view.
uNt_ReLwk40,390680,392680,This is another thing that I'm not expecting
uNt_ReLwk40,392680,395030,to be a great experience on the Steam Deck.
uNt_ReLwk40,395030,397360,Other handhelds have a button
uNt_ReLwk40,397360,400849,to minimize the game and jump to the desktop.
uNt_ReLwk40,400850,404560,I suspect Valve has integrated no such functionality.
uNt_ReLwk40,404560,408760,"I mean, I don't need framed you to tell me that's terrible."
uNt_ReLwk40,408760,412120,I've read about hitches and stutters in this game
uNt_ReLwk40,412120,415630,but this is unbelievable.
uNt_ReLwk40,415630,420370,Valve apparently used the fact that they are translating
uNt_ReLwk40,420370,423150,DirectX to Vulcan to implement
uNt_ReLwk40,423150,426750,a pre-shader compilation routine
uNt_ReLwk40,426750,428640,that prevents it from starting.
uNt_ReLwk40,428640,430350,"The crazy thing about Windows though,"
uNt_ReLwk40,430350,432470,is that this isn't even behaving like
uNt_ReLwk40,432470,435600,on the fly shader compiling.
uNt_ReLwk40,435600,437880,"Like, it should stop doing it."
uNt_ReLwk40,437880,438713,- [Anthony] It should.
uNt_ReLwk40,438713,440130,- [Linus] After I do a full rotation.
uNt_ReLwk40,440130,441150,- [Anthony] But it doesn't.
uNt_ReLwk40,441150,444030,- And so the fact that we're running this translation layer
uNt_ReLwk40,444030,446900,actually results in better smoothness.
uNt_ReLwk40,446900,450340,I think it's time for us to stop the side by side comparison
uNt_ReLwk40,450340,452840,and get into the empirical data then.
uNt_ReLwk40,452840,456860,"We ran benchmarks on three great on Deck games,"
uNt_ReLwk40,456860,459129,and Linux users can breathe the side of relief
uNt_ReLwk40,459130,462080,because SteamOS handily outperformed Windows
uNt_ReLwk40,462080,465199,"Particularly in Hitman 3, where SteamOS gives playable,"
uNt_ReLwk40,465200,466970,if inconsistent frame rates.
uNt_ReLwk40,466970,470960,While Windows average is a painful 19 FPS.
uNt_ReLwk40,470960,473639,Doom Eternal hit a 60 FPSs average on SteamOS
uNt_ReLwk40,473640,475550,while Windows was stuck in the high 40s.
uNt_ReLwk40,475550,479330,And Elden ring famously far more playable on Deck
uNt_ReLwk40,479330,481819,"than on Windows, pulls ahead in terms of frame rate."
uNt_ReLwk40,481820,485300,"And as you guys saw, didn't suffer from the same stuttering"
uNt_ReLwk40,485300,488539,that the PC port has treated Windows gamers too.
uNt_ReLwk40,488540,492450,"Our Swacket don't suffer either, by the way, lttstore.com."
uNt_ReLwk40,492450,495090,But what about controls outside of Steam?
uNt_ReLwk40,495090,496470,We already saw that launching Steam
uNt_ReLwk40,496470,498320,takes over the Deck's controller.
uNt_ReLwk40,498320,501010,"Can we do the same in say, an emulator?"
uNt_ReLwk40,501010,502580,What did you put on here?
uNt_ReLwk40,502580,504400,- [Anthony] I just put on RetroArch.
uNt_ReLwk40,504400,505840,Oh crap.
uNt_ReLwk40,505840,507260,I don't have screen cap.
uNt_ReLwk40,507260,508910,It did this in testing too.
uNt_ReLwk40,508910,510670,"For whatever reason, RetroArch."
uNt_ReLwk40,510670,512070,What you're seeing on your screen is not
uNt_ReLwk40,512070,513190,what I'm seeing on this screen.
uNt_ReLwk40,513190,515229,This screen shows the desktop.
uNt_ReLwk40,515229,516112,"- Oh, beautiful."
uNt_ReLwk40,517640,518473,Oh my God.
uNt_ReLwk40,518473,519306,Come on RetroArch.
uNt_ReLwk40,519306,524306,"I just, I mean, this could be a Steam controller issue."
uNt_ReLwk40,524790,526410,How do I go back if my controller's
uNt_ReLwk40,526410,527949,not allowing me to go back.
uNt_ReLwk40,527950,529010,"Wait. Oh, and this is off now."
uNt_ReLwk40,529010,530380,"Wait, what?"
uNt_ReLwk40,530380,532550,"Back, instead of going back."
uNt_ReLwk40,532550,533383,- [Anthony] Yup.
uNt_ReLwk40,533383,535940,- Negatively toggles a setting and then confirm
uNt_ReLwk40,535940,536900,activates the setting.
uNt_ReLwk40,536900,539520,That is the strangest behavior I think I've ever seen
uNt_ReLwk40,539520,540860,out of a controller ever.
uNt_ReLwk40,540860,543313,- [Anthony] Is Steam still running?
uNt_ReLwk40,543314,544350,- Yes.
uNt_ReLwk40,544350,546410,- [Anthony] That might be the problem.
uNt_ReLwk40,546410,547870,- I don't even know if I'm gonna be able
uNt_ReLwk40,547870,549490,to close this software.
uNt_ReLwk40,549490,552570,"There's no task manager button or control alt delete button,"
uNt_ReLwk40,552570,556042,like you would see on a Windows optimized handheld.
uNt_ReLwk40,556042,558640,That that's the kind of thing that you could probably bind.
uNt_ReLwk40,558640,561270,"I mean, the Steam controller is infinitely customizable."
uNt_ReLwk40,561270,563020,It's one of the best things about it.
uNt_ReLwk40,563020,567270,"But, Anthony, I don't think I could close retro arch"
uNt_ReLwk40,567270,568750,because I can't go back.
uNt_ReLwk40,568750,572540,"This is crazy, X and Y will sometimes go down"
uNt_ReLwk40,572540,574970,or up and down multiple items in the menu.
uNt_ReLwk40,574970,578449,"And sometimes just one, see here, it does just one."
uNt_ReLwk40,578450,580090,What is happening?
uNt_ReLwk40,580090,582870,"- [Anthony] Oh, you activated the onscreen keyboard."
uNt_ReLwk40,582870,583703,- [Linus] I did.?
uNt_ReLwk40,583703,585480,"- [Anthony] Yes. You can't see it, but I can."
uNt_ReLwk40,585480,587089,Unless there's an escape key on that.
uNt_ReLwk40,587090,588530,"No, I don't think that - Press again to quit."
uNt_ReLwk40,588530,589363,Yes.
uNt_ReLwk40,589363,591480,"- [Anthony] Full disclosure, I expected that to happen."
uNt_ReLwk40,591480,592529,"- Oh, thanks Anthony."
uNt_ReLwk40,594070,595530,"Well, this is just as bad."
uNt_ReLwk40,595530,596530,Back doesn't go back.
uNt_ReLwk40,596530,597790,How do I go back?
uNt_ReLwk40,597790,599589,B is trying to close RetroArch.
uNt_ReLwk40,599590,601760,- [Anthony] The default control scheme in Windows
uNt_ReLwk40,601760,604040,"without Steam running for the Steam Deck,"
uNt_ReLwk40,604040,605600,is that that key is escape.
uNt_ReLwk40,605600,607380,- [Linus] So is that a Valve issue
uNt_ReLwk40,607380,609020,or is that a Windows issue?
uNt_ReLwk40,609020,609853,- [Anthony] That would be
uNt_ReLwk40,609853,611370,a Valve's controller mapping issue.
uNt_ReLwk40,611370,613400,"Now, normally that makes sense for navigating Windows"
uNt_ReLwk40,613400,616519,because the up and down arrows are just like the..
uNt_ReLwk40,616519,617352,- [Linus] Yeah.
uNt_ReLwk40,617352,618550,"- [Anthony] the DPAD is the up and down arrows,"
uNt_ReLwk40,618550,619998,left and right.
uNt_ReLwk40,619998,620831,- But I guess...
uNt_ReLwk40,620831,622451,- [Anthony] So you can navigate everything
uNt_ReLwk40,622452,623285,with the buttons pretty well.
uNt_ReLwk40,623285,625190,- That probably why we have an Xbox controller here.
uNt_ReLwk40,625190,626023,- [Anthony] Right.
uNt_ReLwk40,626023,627770,- Because now B is back
uNt_ReLwk40,627770,629690,"because it's picked up as a controller,"
uNt_ReLwk40,629690,633460,not as a Windows pointer device.
uNt_ReLwk40,633460,635320,"- [Anthony] Yeah. So, I think RetroArch"
uNt_ReLwk40,635320,638640,is gonna have to add a controller definition file
uNt_ReLwk40,638640,639630,or something to hook into it.
uNt_ReLwk40,639630,640720,Like they do with the Steam Deck
uNt_ReLwk40,640720,642915,and with the Xbox 360 controller and Xbox One.
uNt_ReLwk40,642915,643839,- Right.
uNt_ReLwk40,643840,645167,"Well, will the game work?"
uNt_ReLwk40,645167,646310,- [Anthony] The game should work.
uNt_ReLwk40,646310,649057,"- Okay. Let's try the game then, at least."
uNt_ReLwk40,649057,651224,(mumbles)
uNt_ReLwk40,653860,655800,What? It doesn't work.
uNt_ReLwk40,655800,658709,"Even in game its still in, oh man."
uNt_ReLwk40,658710,661866,"All right. Well, I still want to know about the latency."
uNt_ReLwk40,661866,663040,"I mean, I guess it'll be fine."
uNt_ReLwk40,663040,665170,It's just Windows.
uNt_ReLwk40,665170,667510,"- [Anthony] I mean, it should be"
uNt_ReLwk40,667510,668343,- Oh yeah.
uNt_ReLwk40,668343,669440,"I mean, this feels great."
uNt_ReLwk40,669440,671410,- [Anthony] Mostly I just wanted to show off the fact
uNt_ReLwk40,671410,673129,that the controls are...
uNt_ReLwk40,673130,674520,"- Hot, garbage and broken."
uNt_ReLwk40,674520,675353,- [Anthony] Yes.
uNt_ReLwk40,675353,676186,- Got it.
uNt_ReLwk40,676186,678300,"- [Anthony] So, better use Steam."
uNt_ReLwk40,678300,680330,"- Yeah, pretty much."
uNt_ReLwk40,680330,684410,"Oh no, not charging Chuck where."
uNt_ReLwk40,684410,686279,"Oh, I wanna get up there."
uNt_ReLwk40,686280,687340,"Ah, balls."
uNt_ReLwk40,687340,690910,And there are a lot of other things to keep in mind
uNt_ReLwk40,690910,692949,if you wanna run Windows on Deck.
uNt_ReLwk40,692950,696220,"For one, you're not able to dual boot SteamOS and Windows"
uNt_ReLwk40,696220,698910,until Valve releases the final SteamOS installer
uNt_ReLwk40,698910,700550,with support for this baked in.
uNt_ReLwk40,700550,702450,"I already mentioned, there isn't an audio driver"
uNt_ReLwk40,702450,705230,for the speakers or the 3.5 millimeter headphone check yet.
uNt_ReLwk40,705230,708690,But audio via USB-C or Bluetooth does work.
uNt_ReLwk40,708690,711330,Apparently a driver will be coming for that sooner
uNt_ReLwk40,711330,712460,rather than later.
uNt_ReLwk40,712460,715090,"Well, we don't have an ETA for is things"
uNt_ReLwk40,715090,717760,like the brightness slider fix.
uNt_ReLwk40,717760,719340,Okay. It works fine sometimes.
uNt_ReLwk40,719340,722040,And sometimes it doesn't respond to the full drag.
uNt_ReLwk40,722040,724829,- [Anthony] Yeah. So you need to drag it back and forth
uNt_ReLwk40,724830,726535,towards the end that you want to go to.
uNt_ReLwk40,726535,728190,"So if you wanna get it brighter, you need to go to max"
uNt_ReLwk40,728190,729327,and drag it back and forth.
uNt_ReLwk40,729327,730160,"You wanna go darker,"
uNt_ReLwk40,730160,731193,"You need to, drag back and forth."
uNt_ReLwk40,731193,733080,"- [Linus] I think if goes slow, its fine."
uNt_ReLwk40,733080,737338,So it might be an acceleration issue with the
uNt_ReLwk40,737338,740010,touch to mouse input detection or whatever.
uNt_ReLwk40,740010,742200,I don't know the proper technical terms for it.
uNt_ReLwk40,742200,744130,But it seems to be that if you go fast
uNt_ReLwk40,744130,745920,"it doesn't make it the whole way, which could be"
uNt_ReLwk40,745920,749019,a touchscreen responsiveness issue in Windows.
uNt_ReLwk40,749020,751740,I'm sure it's fixable but we don't know when
uNt_ReLwk40,751740,753870,or if that will ever be fixed.
uNt_ReLwk40,753870,755800,And there's also the much larger problem
uNt_ReLwk40,755800,758529,where the Deck doesn't like to come out of sleep in Windows.
uNt_ReLwk40,758530,761480,Either it takes forever or never wakes up.
uNt_ReLwk40,761480,764560,So you'll wanna disable sleep
uNt_ReLwk40,764560,766350,unless you're into hard powering off
uNt_ReLwk40,766350,767779,in order to get back into Windows.
uNt_ReLwk40,767780,771550,But that's not a great experience for a handheld device.
uNt_ReLwk40,771550,774019,"What's more, when you go to actually install Windows,"
uNt_ReLwk40,774020,776930,you're gonna notice that the display is rotated 90 degrees.
uNt_ReLwk40,776930,779010,That's actually pretty common for devices like this
uNt_ReLwk40,779010,780620,because they often use panels
uNt_ReLwk40,780620,783020,that were designed originally for tablets.
uNt_ReLwk40,783020,785610,"It just means that until you get to the Windows desktop,"
uNt_ReLwk40,785610,787140,you're gonna have to deal with that.
uNt_ReLwk40,787140,788600,You won't have any wifi
uNt_ReLwk40,788600,790870,so you'll have to install without a product key
uNt_ReLwk40,790870,792920,if you don't have a Type-C ethernet dongle.
uNt_ReLwk40,792920,796459,"And speaking of, you're probably gonna want a Type-C"
uNt_ReLwk40,796460,800090,"to USB-A adapter, or ideally a multi-port dongle"
uNt_ReLwk40,800090,802960,"like this one, so that you can plug in a USB flash drive"
uNt_ReLwk40,802960,804400,and a keyboard and mouse.
uNt_ReLwk40,804400,807933,It can be done without but it's definitely not as seamless.
uNt_ReLwk40,808870,811870,All of which raises the big question here.
uNt_ReLwk40,811870,816070,Why would anyone want to run Windows on the Steam Deck?
uNt_ReLwk40,816070,818650,"Well, I can think of a few reasons."
uNt_ReLwk40,818650,822290,Even ignoring familiarity with the interface and the apps.
uNt_ReLwk40,822290,824820,Access to Xbox services comes to mind.
uNt_ReLwk40,824820,826920,While alternative launchers and storefronts
uNt_ReLwk40,826920,830899,"for epic game store and GOG are available on Linux,"
uNt_ReLwk40,830900,832360,Xbox still isn't.
uNt_ReLwk40,832360,834570,And that means there are some games that you simply
uNt_ReLwk40,834570,836400,cannot play on SteamOS right now.
uNt_ReLwk40,836400,838930,Even ignoring anti-cheat problems.
uNt_ReLwk40,838930,841649,And you're certainly not gonna get access to game pass
uNt_ReLwk40,841650,844320,unless you're streaming from a Windows device
uNt_ReLwk40,844320,846390,or from Microsoft zone servers.
uNt_ReLwk40,846390,849367,I've also personally run into some very frustrating bugs
uNt_ReLwk40,849367,851250,while gaming on the Deck.
uNt_ReLwk40,851250,853900,"I just completed a run through of Horizon Zero Dawn,"
uNt_ReLwk40,853900,855890,start to finish on my personal deck.
uNt_ReLwk40,855890,860130,And I saw everything from drops down to one FPS
uNt_ReLwk40,860130,861540,for extended periods.
uNt_ReLwk40,861540,864579,"Like I'm talking 10 30 seconds at a time,"
uNt_ReLwk40,864580,867640,to hard game crashes back to the Steam Interface.
uNt_ReLwk40,867640,870110,To even black screens that necessitated
uNt_ReLwk40,870110,872440,a full system shut down.
uNt_ReLwk40,872440,874320,This raise is serious questions for me
uNt_ReLwk40,874320,877210,about the thoroughness of Valve's game verification program.
uNt_ReLwk40,877210,879970,Horizon Zero Dawn is a great on Deck game
uNt_ReLwk40,879970,883110,but my experience was anything but great.
uNt_ReLwk40,883110,885890,And I sincerely doubt that if Sony had actually
uNt_ReLwk40,885890,889000,"been involved in this certification process,"
uNt_ReLwk40,889000,890350,they would've signed off on it
uNt_ReLwk40,890350,893300,being advertised as great on Deck.
uNt_ReLwk40,893300,896130,"In fact, there's a great blog post on gaming on Linux"
uNt_ReLwk40,896130,898470,"from the lead developer of FAudio, which is a core"
uNt_ReLwk40,898470,901009,"component of Proton, the compatibility layer"
uNt_ReLwk40,901010,903340,"that allows Windows games to run on Linux,"
uNt_ReLwk40,903340,906300,criticizing Valve's collaboration or lack thereof
uNt_ReLwk40,906300,907670,with third party developers.
uNt_ReLwk40,907670,910290,"So if Valve is just YOLOing it, what's the process?"
uNt_ReLwk40,910290,912430,There are only so many hours in a day
uNt_ReLwk40,912430,915890,and Valve seems to be validating a lot of freaking games.
uNt_ReLwk40,915890,918050,"Based on my experience with Horizon Zero Dawn,"
uNt_ReLwk40,918050,919350,what I suspect they're doing is
uNt_ReLwk40,919350,922829,"they're just firing up the game, playing early areas,"
uNt_ReLwk40,922830,925674,"which in many games tend not to be as demanding and going,"
uNt_ReLwk40,925674,928980,"""Yep. Seems good,"" rubber stamp."
uNt_ReLwk40,928980,930630,And I actually didn't have any issues
uNt_ReLwk40,930630,932640,in the first five hours of my play through
uNt_ReLwk40,932640,933890,for Horizon Zero Dawn.
uNt_ReLwk40,933890,936780,"But by the end, I was getting crashing or stuttering,"
uNt_ReLwk40,936780,938990,about every 30 minutes or so.
uNt_ReLwk40,938990,940810,Not a great experience.
uNt_ReLwk40,940810,944130,"Other than that though, SteamOS is objectively"
uNt_ReLwk40,944130,946800,the much more polished experience.
uNt_ReLwk40,946800,949459,The quick access menu with its convenient diagnostics
uNt_ReLwk40,949460,952510,and controls is conspicuously absent from Windows
uNt_ReLwk40,952510,955210,"and even basic functionality like charging,"
uNt_ReLwk40,955210,957040,still seems to have issues in Windows.
uNt_ReLwk40,957040,959810,We actually observed our Steam Deck discharging
uNt_ReLwk40,959810,961020,"while plugged in, which is something"
uNt_ReLwk40,961020,963890,that I have never seen running SteamOS.
uNt_ReLwk40,963890,968050,So Valve is allowing users to run Windows.
uNt_ReLwk40,968050,970330,Even facilitating it by providing drivers
uNt_ReLwk40,970330,973680,"and public help docs, good guy Valve, a hundred percent."
uNt_ReLwk40,973680,974960,And we're gonna have those linked down below
uNt_ReLwk40,974960,976610,if you wanna do it yourself.
uNt_ReLwk40,976610,980100,"But the roughness of the experience does make me wonder,"
uNt_ReLwk40,980100,982829,are they ever going to put in the effort that it would take
uNt_ReLwk40,982830,986290,to make it as smooth as SteamOS?
uNt_ReLwk40,986290,989300,"My gut feeling is no, which makes me wonder,"
uNt_ReLwk40,989300,991970,how much of the performance difference we saw is down
uNt_ReLwk40,991970,993759,to a lack of a optimization.
uNt_ReLwk40,993760,996580,"I mean, theoretically, the same hardware should perform"
uNt_ReLwk40,996580,998840,very similarly across Windows and Linux.
uNt_ReLwk40,998840,1002230,"And this, our results were not even close."
uNt_ReLwk40,1002230,1003670,"Now, admittedly, that could be"
uNt_ReLwk40,1003670,1005779,as much AMD's fault as Valve's.
uNt_ReLwk40,1005780,1009320,And the Steam Deck also features a very unusual architecture
uNt_ReLwk40,1009320,1012220,"for a Windows machine, with the CPU and GPU course,"
uNt_ReLwk40,1012220,1014319,sharing common memory.
uNt_ReLwk40,1014320,1016730,"I'm sure SteamOS, on the other hand, was carefully tuned"
uNt_ReLwk40,1016730,1018000,to account for this.
uNt_ReLwk40,1018000,1020700,I just feel like there was a lot of Windows performance
uNt_ReLwk40,1020700,1021760,left on the table here.
uNt_ReLwk40,1021760,1023860,And our investigation today has left us
uNt_ReLwk40,1023860,1025750,with more questions than answers.
uNt_ReLwk40,1025750,1027220,The one answer we have right now though
uNt_ReLwk40,1027220,1029949,is that we wouldn't recommend Windows on the Steam Deck.
uNt_ReLwk40,1029949,1031600,At least not in its current state.
uNt_ReLwk40,1031600,1035010,"So, if your must have games don't work on SteamOS,"
uNt_ReLwk40,1035010,1037670,you might just have to pony up for a competing handheld.
uNt_ReLwk40,1037670,1040790,That is at least until Valve makes dual booting possible.
uNt_ReLwk40,1040790,1042620,"Which is something we're planning to explore,"
uNt_ReLwk40,1042620,1045300,along with a two terabyte internal storage upgrade
uNt_ReLwk40,1045300,1046133,to the Deck.
uNt_ReLwk40,1046133,1048860,So make sure you are subscribed for that.
uNt_ReLwk40,1048860,1050010,And make sure you're subscribed to hear
uNt_ReLwk40,1050010,1051580,"about our sponsor, dbrand."
uNt_ReLwk40,1051580,1054580,The robots at dbrand drove a truck of money to our office
uNt_ReLwk40,1054580,1058039,to push their new project kill switch on pretty much
uNt_ReLwk40,1058040,1059960,every Steam Deck video that we have.
uNt_ReLwk40,1059960,1061409,What's project kill switch?
uNt_ReLwk40,1061410,1063750,"Well, it's a project to kill the switch, I think."
uNt_ReLwk40,1063750,1066200,"Basically, it's similar to their grip cases for phones"
uNt_ReLwk40,1066200,1068679,"and other devices, but for your Steam Deck."
uNt_ReLwk40,1068680,1070430,"it's got a rugged rubberized finish,"
uNt_ReLwk40,1070430,1072660,plus a kickstand for when you're gaming on the go
uNt_ReLwk40,1072660,1074380,but you wanna pull out a controller.
uNt_ReLwk40,1074380,1076180,They've also got their tempered glass screen protector
uNt_ReLwk40,1076180,1078460,"for the Steam Deck, which we tested out for them."
uNt_ReLwk40,1078460,1081760,Turns out regular tempered glass inhibits touch sensitivity
