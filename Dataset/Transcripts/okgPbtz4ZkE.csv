okgPbtz4ZkE,799,2720,this is the lockpicking lawyer and one
okgPbtz4ZkE,2720,4720,of the easiest ways of entering a
okgPbtz4ZkE,4720,7359,supposedly secure building is known as
okgPbtz4ZkE,7359,9599,tailgating that's what we call the
okgPbtz4ZkE,9599,11920,social engineering practice of following
okgPbtz4ZkE,11920,14320,an authorized person through a locked
okgPbtz4ZkE,14320,16240,door that way you don't have to deal
okgPbtz4ZkE,16240,18880,with the access control system and if
okgPbtz4ZkE,18880,21359,your target is not too savvy all you
okgPbtz4ZkE,21359,23600,really need is a tray of coffee in each
okgPbtz4ZkE,23600,25680,hand to convince them to hold the door
okgPbtz4ZkE,25680,28000,for you but thankfully people are
okgPbtz4ZkE,28000,30240,getting better educated and tricks like
okgPbtz4ZkE,30240,32320,that work less and less
okgPbtz4ZkE,32320,35120,so the goal becomes how to piggyback off
okgPbtz4ZkE,35120,36800,someone's credentials without them
okgPbtz4ZkE,36800,37920,knowing
okgPbtz4ZkE,37920,39920,in the past i've discussed a couple of
okgPbtz4ZkE,39920,42399,strategies for how to do this with rfid
okgPbtz4ZkE,42399,44960,tags including the use of a device like
okgPbtz4ZkE,44960,47039,this to read the card right out of your
okgPbtz4ZkE,47039,50800,target's pocket that was video 1056 and
okgPbtz4ZkE,50800,53360,i've also discussed how to use a tiny
okgPbtz4ZkE,53360,55840,wireless bug like this to tap your
okgPbtz4ZkE,55840,59680,target's reader that was video 1052
okgPbtz4ZkE,59680,61680,but what do you do when there's a keypad
okgPbtz4ZkE,61680,63520,like this one involved
okgPbtz4ZkE,63520,66240,well these bugs can be useful in those
okgPbtz4ZkE,66240,68640,circumstances but there is a less
okgPbtz4ZkE,68640,71119,intrusive way albeit one with some
okgPbtz4ZkE,71119,72560,shortcomings
okgPbtz4ZkE,72560,74479,look what happens when you approach a
okgPbtz4ZkE,74479,76960,keypad with this smartphone thermal
okgPbtz4ZkE,76960,79360,imager you need to do it within about 10
okgPbtz4ZkE,79360,82320,to 15 seconds of code entry but you get
okgPbtz4ZkE,82320,86600,a very interesting result
okgPbtz4ZkE,97520,99680,okay as you saw that gives a pretty
okgPbtz4ZkE,99680,101840,clear indication of what buttons were
okgPbtz4ZkE,101840,104159,pressed and if you carefully watch heat
okgPbtz4ZkE,104159,106880,intensity it can give you a general idea
okgPbtz4ZkE,106880,108720,of digit order though i'd want to
okgPbtz4ZkE,108720,110640,combine that data with general
okgPbtz4ZkE,110640,113119,observations of hand movement
okgPbtz4ZkE,113119,115840,another shortcoming of this device is
okgPbtz4ZkE,115840,118320,range this only works well for things
okgPbtz4ZkE,118320,121439,like this within a few feet so i tried
okgPbtz4ZkE,121439,123119,something else
okgPbtz4ZkE,123119,126000,this may look like a traditional rifle
okgPbtz4ZkE,126000,128239,scope but it's actually packed with a
okgPbtz4ZkE,128239,130959,high-end thermal imager batteries and a
okgPbtz4ZkE,130959,133599,computer that wirelessly pairs to my
okgPbtz4ZkE,133599,136400,smartphone this can easily distinguish
okgPbtz4ZkE,136400,139280,the heat of game animals up to about 500
okgPbtz4ZkE,139280,142080,yards and depending on conditions the
okgPbtz4ZkE,142080,144800,heat left by your fingertip from 40 to
okgPbtz4ZkE,144800,146480,50 feet away
okgPbtz4ZkE,146480,148800,oddly despite wide knowledge of this
okgPbtz4ZkE,148800,151120,exploit i've never seen someone try it
okgPbtz4ZkE,151120,153680,from a distance so let me give you a
okgPbtz4ZkE,153680,156640,demo from about 30 feet away
okgPbtz4ZkE,156640,158480,you'll see this higher end sensor can
okgPbtz4ZkE,158480,160879,detect finger touches for about two to
okgPbtz4ZkE,160879,163680,three times longer than this tiny
okgPbtz4ZkE,163680,166000,smartphone sensor in fact in perfect
okgPbtz4ZkE,166000,168160,conditions i've had it work for almost a
okgPbtz4ZkE,168160,171840,minute after code entry
okgPbtz4ZkE,194560,196879,okay folks while i do think that was
okgPbtz4ZkE,196879,199599,impressive it's obviously not a perfect
okgPbtz4ZkE,199599,201440,solution especially when it comes to
okgPbtz4ZkE,201440,204400,digit order and repeated digits it can
okgPbtz4ZkE,204400,206480,also be greatly affected by weather
okgPbtz4ZkE,206480,208640,conditions and the construction of the
okgPbtz4ZkE,208640,209760,keypad
okgPbtz4ZkE,209760,212480,but if used in the right condition and
okgPbtz4ZkE,212480,214480,in conjunction with other observations
okgPbtz4ZkE,214480,217599,it can be very effective so how do you
okgPbtz4ZkE,217599,219920,defend against it it's actually pretty
okgPbtz4ZkE,219920,222879,easy just briefly rest your fingers on
okgPbtz4ZkE,222879,227799,all the buttons after entering the code
okgPbtz4ZkE,233439,235599,okay folks i hope you found that both
okgPbtz4ZkE,235599,237840,interesting and helpful but that's all i
okgPbtz4ZkE,237840,239920,have for you today if you do have any
okgPbtz4ZkE,239920,241920,questions or comments about this please
okgPbtz4ZkE,241920,243920,put them below if you like this video
okgPbtz4ZkE,243920,245519,and would like to see more like it
okgPbtz4ZkE,245519,248159,please subscribe and as always have a
okgPbtz4ZkE,248159,252400,nice day thank you
