3xmi4vUwtlM,2720,5200,of central asia's most rarely seen food
3xmi4vUwtlM,5200,6319,big reveal
3xmi4vUwtlM,6319,9120,it's still hot it's steaming
3xmi4vUwtlM,9120,11679,this is
3xmi4vUwtlM,12320,14400,this dish is only prepared once a year
3xmi4vUwtlM,14400,17520,for the uzbek navru's holiday
3xmi4vUwtlM,17520,20160,and this year they're making a lot well
3xmi4vUwtlM,20160,21760,over a thousand pounds how are you doing
3xmi4vUwtlM,21760,22960,over there on that side i feel like the
3xmi4vUwtlM,22960,24720,wind's only coming towards me i'm
3xmi4vUwtlM,24720,27519,feeling pretty good
3xmi4vUwtlM,28400,29920,once you see how it's made you'll
3xmi4vUwtlM,29920,31599,understand why it's not so common what
3xmi4vUwtlM,31599,33120,they're doing right now seems easy
3xmi4vUwtlM,33120,34880,except for it's freezing outside the
3xmi4vUwtlM,34880,37200,making from beginning to end takes over
3xmi4vUwtlM,37200,40480,24 hours people hear tough as actual
3xmi4vUwtlM,40480,42160,nails with this painfully long and
3xmi4vUwtlM,42160,44239,difficult process this is the final
3xmi4vUwtlM,44239,45920,product
3xmi4vUwtlM,45920,48239,all starts with one simple task well
3xmi4vUwtlM,48239,51039,good morning everybody it is 5 a.m here
3xmi4vUwtlM,51039,52879,in uzbekistan we are in the city of
3xmi4vUwtlM,52879,55600,namangan and we are up very early for a
3xmi4vUwtlM,55600,58719,special reason is to come here and see
3xmi4vUwtlM,58719,59680,this
3xmi4vUwtlM,59680,61840,but the crews perhaps you could tell me
3xmi4vUwtlM,61840,63680,what i'm looking at what you're looking
3xmi4vUwtlM,63680,66159,at is the sweet sprout
3xmi4vUwtlM,66159,68080,this wheat is not milled for flour
3xmi4vUwtlM,68080,70400,instead we're after the natural sweet
3xmi4vUwtlM,70400,72479,juice inside to get the sprouts ready
3xmi4vUwtlM,72479,74320,for this moment they've been watered
3xmi4vUwtlM,74320,76560,four times a day for the last three days
3xmi4vUwtlM,76560,78479,right here in their home how much has
3xmi4vUwtlM,78479,81600,this pile grown since it started
3xmi4vUwtlM,81600,84159,we grew 100 if you would invest early
3xmi4vUwtlM,84159,86240,ipo you would get hundred percent roy
3xmi4vUwtlM,86240,89119,bro so you missed it roy you call it roy
3xmi4vUwtlM,89119,90240,i like that
3xmi4vUwtlM,90240,91759,simple weed sprouts are the main
3xmi4vUwtlM,91759,93280,ingredient for sumilac but there's
3xmi4vUwtlM,93280,95040,nothing simple about the food making
3xmi4vUwtlM,95040,96799,process we're about to witness a lot of
3xmi4vUwtlM,96799,98479,the sumalac is going to be made today
3xmi4vUwtlM,98479,101280,over a ton is this enough this is
3xmi4vUwtlM,101280,103520,decentralized way of doing it you have
3xmi4vUwtlM,103520,105119,to expect 30 more of that different
3xmi4vUwtlM,105119,107360,houses
3xmi4vUwtlM,107439,109119,after collecting the weed sprouts they
3xmi4vUwtlM,109119,110960,must be brought to a grinder to help
3xmi4vUwtlM,110960,112880,release the juices inside we've come to
3xmi4vUwtlM,112880,114880,our next location this is the grinding
3xmi4vUwtlM,114880,116799,place with the grinding lady hi how you
3xmi4vUwtlM,116799,118960,doing
3xmi4vUwtlM,119190,120880,[Music]
3xmi4vUwtlM,120880,122320,so what i'm curious about is that this
3xmi4vUwtlM,122320,124799,is a dessert but you don't add any sugar
3xmi4vUwtlM,124799,126719,to it later on no that means all the
3xmi4vUwtlM,126719,129119,sweetness has to be coming from this so
3xmi4vUwtlM,129119,131200,i'm dying to try out the actual rough
3xmi4vUwtlM,131200,134640,raw ingredients right now
3xmi4vUwtlM,135280,136400,so at first it tastes like something
3xmi4vUwtlM,136400,137760,that would go on a salad next to the
3xmi4vUwtlM,137760,139520,croutons and the diced tomatoes yeah and
3xmi4vUwtlM,139520,140480,then there's like a little bit of a
3xmi4vUwtlM,140480,142080,sweetness to it almost a little vanilla
3xmi4vUwtlM,142080,143760,too
3xmi4vUwtlM,143760,145680,so we are here at the final site where
3xmi4vUwtlM,145680,147120,all the cooking and all the fun is going
3xmi4vUwtlM,147120,149599,to happen i really admire the commitment
3xmi4vUwtlM,149599,151040,of the people here because it is just a
3xmi4vUwtlM,151040,153040,few degrees above freezing and some
3xmi4vUwtlM,153040,154720,people are just wearing like slippers
3xmi4vUwtlM,154720,156319,i'm freezing my ass off i don't know how
3xmi4vUwtlM,156319,158239,they do it right here the wheat sprouts
3xmi4vUwtlM,158239,159840,have been ground they've been soaking
3xmi4vUwtlM,159840,161519,water for about half an hour and they
3xmi4vUwtlM,161519,163680,put it through this net this mesh cloth
3xmi4vUwtlM,163680,165599,is gonna allow all the liquid to filter
3xmi4vUwtlM,165599,166879,through and then they kind of give it a
3xmi4vUwtlM,166879,168560,squeeze this is what we want right here
3xmi4vUwtlM,168560,172000,this liquid oh confusion confusion they
3xmi4vUwtlM,172000,175360,don't have a place for the refuse ah
3xmi4vUwtlM,175360,178360,solution
3xmi4vUwtlM,184239,186319,getting ready everyone is pitching in in
3xmi4vUwtlM,186319,187760,different ways some people are bringing
3xmi4vUwtlM,187760,189360,these big hazans or setting them up
3xmi4vUwtlM,189360,190640,getting them ready putting the mud
3xmi4vUwtlM,190640,192239,around them to seal them some people are
3xmi4vUwtlM,192239,194560,starting fires cleaning so it's a huge
3xmi4vUwtlM,194560,196480,group community effort and by tomorrow
3xmi4vUwtlM,196480,198720,morning we're going to see over a ton of
3xmi4vUwtlM,198720,200720,this stuff be made and given out for
3xmi4vUwtlM,200720,202879,free to the public so that is the big
3xmi4vUwtlM,202879,206000,moment we're building up to
3xmi4vUwtlM,206260,207920,[Music]
3xmi4vUwtlM,207920,210000,before the hazan even heats up the
3xmi4vUwtlM,210000,213360,ingredients are added
3xmi4vUwtlM,213360,215440,first cottonseed oil is spread around
3xmi4vUwtlM,215440,217840,the pan
3xmi4vUwtlM,218640,220799,then they add rocks
3xmi4vUwtlM,220799,221920,that's right
3xmi4vUwtlM,221920,224000,river rocks are crucial to the process
3xmi4vUwtlM,224000,227120,and you'll find out why soon
3xmi4vUwtlM,227120,229200,now we're ready for that precious weed
3xmi4vUwtlM,229200,231840,sprout juice filtered and drained into
3xmi4vUwtlM,231840,234319,the kazan as the contents of the pan
3xmi4vUwtlM,234319,236480,continue to blend we're now ready for
3xmi4vUwtlM,236480,238239,the last ingredient
3xmi4vUwtlM,238239,241360,right here wheat flour
3xmi4vUwtlM,241360,243040,so they have wheat flour they pour that
3xmi4vUwtlM,243040,244799,into and then they kind of whisk it
3xmi4vUwtlM,244799,246799,about mix it in and get all the clumps
3xmi4vUwtlM,246799,248159,out of there so this is going to get a
3xmi4vUwtlM,248159,249920,lot more full and when it is they're
3xmi4vUwtlM,249920,251599,going to finally start the fire and get
3xmi4vUwtlM,251599,253680,this to boiling a bit this is miss
3xmi4vUwtlM,253680,255920,inobot and her family helping her to mix
3xmi4vUwtlM,255920,257840,in the wheat flour though everyone has a
3xmi4vUwtlM,257840,260079,slight twist to their strategy as i said
3xmi4vUwtlM,260079,261600,it is not just the women that we came
3xmi4vUwtlM,261600,263520,with today there are 10 different
3xmi4vUwtlM,263520,265280,cousins and so many people from the
3xmi4vUwtlM,265280,267280,community pitching in to make this event
3xmi4vUwtlM,267280,269440,happen some people have a stick some
3xmi4vUwtlM,269440,271440,people have a whisk and this lady has an
3xmi4vUwtlM,271440,273600,electrical mixer it's plugged into an
3xmi4vUwtlM,273600,275280,extension cord does this go all the way
3xmi4vUwtlM,275280,277040,to your house
3xmi4vUwtlM,277040,278560,we're in a park what is this even
3xmi4vUwtlM,278560,281120,plugged into it's brilliant i love it so
3xmi4vUwtlM,281120,284320,this is how you work smart not hard very
3xmi4vUwtlM,284320,285600,nice
3xmi4vUwtlM,285600,287919,oh i was gonna give her a fist bump but
3xmi4vUwtlM,287919,289520,she's actually holding the electrical in
3xmi4vUwtlM,289520,291280,the other hand at this point there are
3xmi4vUwtlM,291280,293040,no more ingredients to add we're just
3xmi4vUwtlM,293040,294840,gonna need a little bit of
3xmi4vUwtlM,294840,296400,heat
3xmi4vUwtlM,296400,298479,as the fire begins to roar more
3xmi4vUwtlM,298479,300560,attention and care is required at each
3xmi4vUwtlM,300560,303039,vessel ensuring this liquid keeps moving
3xmi4vUwtlM,303039,305199,and doesn't burn potentially wasting
3xmi4vUwtlM,305199,307919,hours of effort remember those rocks as
3xmi4vUwtlM,307919,310000,they shift around they help create even
3xmi4vUwtlM,310000,312000,more motion so the liquid doesn't stick
3xmi4vUwtlM,312000,313759,because yes it's wild to see the
3xmi4vUwtlM,313759,315199,progress that has happened in just a
3xmi4vUwtlM,315199,316960,couple hours i would be standing here
3xmi4vUwtlM,316960,319120,there's a reason i'm not there's a fire
3xmi4vUwtlM,319120,322320,blazing under the hazan
3xmi4vUwtlM,322320,325560,i was fine
3xmi4vUwtlM,328800,331120,she's like please go out of the fire and

3xmi4vUwtlM,332960,334560,help me too right
3xmi4vUwtlM,334560,336080,so what is the technique here so what
3xmi4vUwtlM,336080,337840,you do is that you have to make sure
3xmi4vUwtlM,337840,339840,that it's not going to stick under the
3xmi4vUwtlM,339840,342160,bottom yeah so you always have to scrap
3xmi4vUwtlM,342160,344479,the bottom no it's okay
3xmi4vUwtlM,344479,345919,my favorite part is this lady does not
3xmi4vUwtlM,345919,348240,trust me at all i'm like no i insist
3xmi4vUwtlM,348240,350000,i'll do it she's like no you won't

3xmi4vUwtlM,514080,515919,steak can you just eat it like this yeah
3xmi4vUwtlM,515919,519080,all right
3xmi4vUwtlM,521120,523200,beautifully seasoned minced right off of
3xmi4vUwtlM,523200,524800,the grill got a little crispy on the
3xmi4vUwtlM,524800,526560,outside but it's just nothing but juicy
3xmi4vUwtlM,526560,528160,deliciousness on the inside this is one
3xmi4vUwtlM,528160,529440,of my favorite things so far it's so
3xmi4vUwtlM,529440,531200,simple but so delicious it's classic
3xmi4vUwtlM,531200,532560,it's something most people know but not
3xmi4vUwtlM,532560,535600,to be overlooked or under-appreciated
3xmi4vUwtlM,535600,537680,we have found yet another very unique
3xmi4vUwtlM,537680,539040,food something i've not seen in any
3xmi4vUwtlM,539040,540880,market so far so this isn't the typical
3xmi4vUwtlM,540880,543440,heavy hot oily food no this is something
3xmi4vUwtlM,543440,544640,completely different although i gotta
3xmi4vUwtlM,544640,547680,say actually it is fried yeah but it's
3xmi4vUwtlM,547680,549760,not meat it's seafood essentially it
3xmi4vUwtlM,549760,551760,comes from carp freshwater fish here we
3xmi4vUwtlM,551760,553600,saw in the last episode how much people
3xmi4vUwtlM,553600,555680,in this area love the freshwater fish
3xmi4vUwtlM,555680,557120,how much beer has this fish been
3xmi4vUwtlM,557120,558399,drinking
3xmi4vUwtlM,558399,560320,look at that belly but here they're
3xmi4vUwtlM,560320,562480,utilizing the egg sac so they chop it
3xmi4vUwtlM,562480,564959,into pieces wrap it in batter fry it and
3xmi4vUwtlM,564959,567920,then you get this
3xmi4vUwtlM,568000,569920,i think it's unique bro i haven't seen
3xmi4vUwtlM,569920,571680,in other markets it looks like hush
3xmi4vUwtlM,571680,572959,puppies
3xmi4vUwtlM,572959,576800,what's that fishy it smells like oil
3xmi4vUwtlM,576800,578080,it's interesting because the eggs inside
3xmi4vUwtlM,578080,580000,now have a bready texture to them but
3xmi4vUwtlM,580000,581519,you can feel the individual eggs like
3xmi4vUwtlM,581519,582959,popping in your mouth right this is like
3xmi4vUwtlM,582959,584560,a bread it doesn't taste like a fish
3xmi4vUwtlM,584560,587040,except the
3xmi4vUwtlM,588839,591440,aftertaste back at the park the sumilac
3xmi4vUwtlM,591440,594000,sisters continue on they've come too far
3xmi4vUwtlM,594000,595920,to turn back now i promised you a

3xmi4vUwtlM,597600,600000,time mixing oh my gosh the only minor
3xmi4vUwtlM,600000,601120,problem is that i don't think your

3xmi4vUwtlM,617200,618880,halfway through the sumilac making
3xmi4vUwtlM,618880,621440,process after 10 hours of continuous
3xmi4vUwtlM,621440,624240,stirring the sumalac transforms in color
3xmi4vUwtlM,624240,625920,and consistency we tell you this morning

3xmi4vUwtlM,633200,634959,the color of this it's completely
3xmi4vUwtlM,634959,637200,transformed it's thick it's bubbling
3xmi4vUwtlM,637200,639920,it's dark brown it looks like caramel or
3xmi4vUwtlM,639920,642079,chocolaty she has her paddle here she's
3xmi4vUwtlM,642079,643839,gonna give us a little bit this is like

3xmi4vUwtlM,647279,648410,let's try it up
3xmi4vUwtlM,648410,650079,[Music]
3xmi4vUwtlM,650079,652640,wow this is an incredible strange and
3xmi4vUwtlM,652640,654320,very unique flavor that reminds me of
3xmi4vUwtlM,654320,657279,odeng in korea yeah why does it remind
3xmi4vUwtlM,657279,659680,me of like a fishy soup in korea
3xmi4vUwtlM,659680,661440,at this point it's not incredibly sweet
3xmi4vUwtlM,661440,663839,it's a little bit like savory
3xmi4vUwtlM,663839,665920,so she says that the sweetness is like a
3xmi4vUwtlM,665920,666880,50
3xmi4vUwtlM,666880,669120,because it's gotta stay another 12 hours
3xmi4vUwtlM,669120,671600,without fire in that time so it's gonna
3xmi4vUwtlM,671600,675639,become really really sweet
3xmi4vUwtlM,675680,678000,the hardest part is now finished from
