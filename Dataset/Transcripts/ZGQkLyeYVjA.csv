ZGQkLyeYVjA,299440,306320,and last but not least of course mr  warden thank you it's been an honor  i've got a few recommendations for your
ZGQkLyeYVjA,306320,311919,consideration  um  you may remember uh back in april of 21
ZGQkLyeYVjA,311919,316960,i gave you an article about the  lighthouse study you probably should  still have it but i've got some copies
ZGQkLyeYVjA,316960,322240,if you don't we can provide more  and i've got another article to give you  tonight
ZGQkLyeYVjA,322240,327840,the studies show that high impact boards  have a positive effect on student  achievement
ZGQkLyeYVjA,327840,334639,likewise high impact boards that exhibit  a high level of commitment to their  professional
ZGQkLyeYVjA,334639,341680,usually attract and keep  good superintendents which i believe we  have done
ZGQkLyeYVjA,343039,349680,and by doing that also  contain rank executive leadership
ZGQkLyeYVjA,349680,355520,great principals  teachers and support staff and i have a  few more specific recommendations just
ZGQkLyeYVjA,355520,361680,for your consideration  i would  continue defining your concepts and
ZGQkLyeYVjA,361680,367759,protocols from the shared value work we  did  together with your new superintendent
ZGQkLyeYVjA,367759,374080,and staff i would undertake the creation  of a new bold vision and mission for  ecpps
ZGQkLyeYVjA,374080,379199,strategically  i recommend the design team call it  anything you want but i recommend
ZGQkLyeYVjA,379199,384639,something like that consisting of  several principals teacher and student  leaders to be charged with drafting this
ZGQkLyeYVjA,384639,390479,work let them do the work for you or the  bulk of it some of this has been done we  had a meeting at montero's we've
ZGQkLyeYVjA,390479,397360,archived that information  and i've also interviewed uh select  seniors from northeastern and also
ZGQkLyeYVjA,397360,403680,pchs pacific county high school and they  actually produced a  draft of a vision that you'll have that
ZGQkLyeYVjA,403680,409199,you can work from you don't have to  recreate the wheel there  as you identified i would make sure that
ZGQkLyeYVjA,409199,414960,one of your protocols is developed  around communication because each one of  you the first time in my career that a
ZGQkLyeYVjA,414960,421919,board  individually has said communication is  your number one priority so keep it that  way develop a develop a good protocol
ZGQkLyeYVjA,421919,427280,for that at least one  and this sounds like a broken record but
ZGQkLyeYVjA,427280,432880,it's so important remain cognizant you  understand it very well but remain  cognizant of the difference between
ZGQkLyeYVjA,432880,439039,governance and management  effective  incorporated into ongoing professional
ZGQkLyeYVjA,439039,445599,development  you cannot do too  much professional development most  boards don't do enough
ZGQkLyeYVjA,445599,452160,quite frankly  consider adding expected time spans for  board agenda items for instance if we
ZGQkLyeYVjA,452160,458240,have we don't do it now but you may want  to consider or don't have to  uh close session from i'll just pick a
ZGQkLyeYVjA,458240,464080,time 6 to 6 30. that way the  having time frames for each agenda item
ZGQkLyeYVjA,464080,472000,tends to keep us  on schedule  uh it keeps keeps us to task it keeps it
ZGQkLyeYVjA,472000,477680,minimizes the chances of straying  off course sometimes  but we're all human and that happens
ZGQkLyeYVjA,477680,483919,from time to time but that's that's a  practice i've seen in other places  um
ZGQkLyeYVjA,483919,490160,i understand you know if you choose to  implement some of these things  um and this is just an overview this
ZGQkLyeYVjA,490160,495680,isn't everything  it won't happen all at one time i think  that the board you should engage with
ZGQkLyeYVjA,495680,501520,your new superintendent or dr parker to  have a retreat to define his specific  performance goals
ZGQkLyeYVjA,501520,507520,the first goal as i've said before  should be to collaboratively create a  new bold vision
ZGQkLyeYVjA,507520,513360,and please remember that like democracy  the board superintendent function is  fragile
ZGQkLyeYVjA,513360,517839,so you have to always work on this  together
ZGQkLyeYVjA,518399,523839,so  including  those that are charged with doing the
ZGQkLyeYVjA,523839,530399,work and i.e our teachers and our  principals and our support staff at our  schools
ZGQkLyeYVjA,530399,536640,they should be involved in this work  because that provides the north star the  direction that you'll take for the next
ZGQkLyeYVjA,536640,542080,several years  what they think matters  what they think matters and i know you
ZGQkLyeYVjA,542080,549120,believe that because i've had individual  conversations with you about this  finally and most importantly i want all
ZGQkLyeYVjA,549120,554880,of us  to support dr parker and his  recommendations for instructional  improvement he is the professional
ZGQkLyeYVjA,554880,560000,educational consultant to the board  we understand
ZGQkLyeYVjA,560000,565200,dr parker we understand that we just  can't cross our fingers and hope that  you stay for
ZGQkLyeYVjA,565200,570880,a long  time  certainly that's what we want but we  also understand that we have to work
ZGQkLyeYVjA,570880,576080,together to make that happen  um high impact boards understand that
ZGQkLyeYVjA,576080,582800,and do that  a recently departed  friend of mine tom pazant spent 11 years
ZGQkLyeYVjA,582800,588880,in boston as their superintendent which  is almost unheard of 11 years in boston  he died last year
ZGQkLyeYVjA,588880,595279,but part of that was his ability to  build great relationships with the board
ZGQkLyeYVjA,595279,601600,of education in boston public schools  so  just because we're smaller doesn't mean
ZGQkLyeYVjA,601600,608240,we're not greater elizabeth city pastor  prank schools is greater but it has to  be an intentional effort
ZGQkLyeYVjA,608240,615360,and finally  i have enjoyed  reconnecting with our community  and i will always remain available to
ZGQkLyeYVjA,615360,620959,you as an ardent supporter of elizabeth  city passport public schools so madam  chair
ZGQkLyeYVjA,620959,628000,board members  dr parker members of the audience thank  you and here's that article i promised

ZGQkLyeYVjA,2220400,2229200,okay as the board members are aware  we are on the precipice of selecting
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2229200,2234960,students to be  members of our board  and
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2234960,2241200,ms pereza along with mr archuletta and  mr walton
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2241359,2248000,served on this community to um  do that to get that organized so
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2248000,2250800,ms pereza
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2253040,2259520,good to announce that we have  three applicants from pascal tank county  high school and three applicants from
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2259520,2266240,northeastern who have completed all the  requirements for our application process
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2267680,2274480,their gpas have all been confirmed by  their principals or schools and now the  next step is for us to
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2274480,2280960,schedule their interviews  so the committee has discussed a couple  of different options and we just want to
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2280960,2287040,know what the board prefers  the interviews need to occur in july
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2287040,2293440,as you know we typically only have one  meeting in july we don't have a  committee we just have a board meeting
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2293440,2300880,so the options would be to  schedule these interviews at our next  meeting july 25th
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2300880,2307680,that would mean that we would have six  interviews that night  i don't anticipate them being long
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2307680,2313040,interviews  i think you know their high school  students they make it as brief as
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2313040,2318240,possible for them  and the other option would be to  schedule
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2318240,2324320,another meeting  maybe on the 11th or the 18th  like we would normally have a committee
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2324320,2330560,meeting and do the interviews then  we just didn't know what the board  preferred i'm not sure what the agenda
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2330560,2337280,will be like in july  how heavy it will be  so i don't know if you know ford
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2337280,2344480,would prefer to have  a longer meeting on july 25th and only  meet once that month or
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2344480,2353960,the other option again would be have the  regular board meeting on the 25th and a  separate meeting to do the interviews
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2360480,2365599,say that again  he said he preferred a short meeting on
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2365599,2372560,the 18th which would be our  date that  for a committee meeting if we were if we
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2372560,2377599,were going to have a committee meeting  this month  and since this is our first year doing
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2377599,2382640,this it was a thought that that just  kind of popped in my head before the  meeting you know
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2382640,2387920,typically july is only a board meeting  but moving forward we could kind of set
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2387920,2393599,that we would have interviews in place  of a committee meeting moving forward
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2393599,2400720,um and that would be that what that  meeting is for um the first meeting in  july and then
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2400720,2405839,hopefully july 25th at that meeting it  would make sense to go ahead and discuss
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2405839,2412640,and vote on the  board members for each school  if that makes sense okay with that yeah
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2412640,2418000,just didn't know if everyone was going  to be  um  in town
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2418000,2425200,and available to sit in on those  interviews  the other  concern would be if one of the students
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2425200,2434240,was not able  to  attend on the 18th we could give them  the 25th as a second option
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2434880,2441760,does that sound okay  that sounds good  um  how about our uh members who are joining
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2441760,2446960,us virtually do you have a problem with  either one of those dates
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2446960,2452640,no  i'm gonna go with both  okay all right great so
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2452640,2459760,we don't need to take action on that but  we will need to announce that we're  having  a meeting on the 18th are you guys okay
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2459760,2464800,with um  starting it
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2465520,2471760,say 5 30.  that'd be okay for everyone  and then um
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2471760,2477920,the next thing you will receive packets  for each student via email
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2477920,2484160,we did have a couple of pieces that  um because some of the applications were
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2484160,2489839,online  in  on paper and then some half and half but  it's taken us a while to get it all
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2489839,2495599,organized but we have it all ready to go  get it scanned in and organized and
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2495599,2501440,that you can look at the applications  for all six and again we did not have  anyone from the early college did speak
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2501440,2508160,to miss fight and um  she did really try to get  an applicant or two but she said she'll
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2508160,2514240,be on it for next year  so start working on the  juniors
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2514240,2521599,for this year for next year yeah that's  right  that's it  so we're going to meet on the 18th at 5
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2521599,2528560,30  for interviews for the student members  if any member any of those students are
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2528560,2535280,unable to attend then they will come on  the 25th which is our regular board  meeting and we'll conduct the interviews
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2535280,2542160,for those particular students at that  time okay start reaching out to the  students and making sure that they can
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2542160,2547839,come i mean i'm thinking  a 10 15 minute slot at the most for each
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2547839,2553359,student  if that's okay with everyone  sounds good
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2553359,2558960,thank you very much all of you for  working so hard on this and i know
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2558960,2564480,miss perez you had some assistance on  the central office level
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2564480,2570560,with some of these applications that  were coming in so i want to thank those  persons as well
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2570560,2576079,uh okay  so we're all set for that and we're  going to move on to the global citizens
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2576079,2582240,and healthy students committee mr  archuleta  yes uh
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2582240,2586640,and me and uh mr spence
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2587599,2593119,community  that's not all officers the governor
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2593119,2599440,and uh dr ingram and some of the  staff the central staff
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2599440,2606240,just discovered  that our office claimed  because they were going to of questions
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2606240,2611359,that were all for  people  uh
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2611359,2617280,what we decided is there's going to be  some tweaking to the mlu
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2617280,2622800,and  we also talked about uh the duties of  the sro
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2622800,2628480,and to get them more active and uh  the principles seem to be all right with
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2628480,2635280,that and i do believe  that uh once dr parker's on board
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2635280,2640720,we will continue with another meeting or  encourage him to meet
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2640720,2645839,with them to keep it going and see  what we come up with because we want to
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2645839,2652079,make sure that the  administrators from the school are  satisfied
ZGQkLyeYVjA,2652079,2658160,that they are up to date on everything  and they are satisfied because
