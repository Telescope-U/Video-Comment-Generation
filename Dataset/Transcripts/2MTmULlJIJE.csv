2MTmULlJIJE,2120,4880,[Music]
2MTmULlJIJE,4880,8559,2022 is a big year for gaming both in
2MTmULlJIJE,8559,10719,sheer volume of releases and the hype
2MTmULlJIJE,10719,13120,surrounding them but as we get further
2MTmULlJIJE,13120,15120,into this new generation of gaming more
2MTmULlJIJE,15120,16800,titles that push the limits of what's
2MTmULlJIJE,16800,19279,graphically possible are on the way
2MTmULlJIJE,19279,21359,let's take a look at 15 graphically
2MTmULlJIJE,21359,23680,mind-blowing titles coming up this year
2MTmULlJIJE,23680,26880,and what makes them stand out
2MTmULlJIJE,26880,29359,horizon forbidden west
2MTmULlJIJE,29359,31760,horizon zero dawn is a great looking
2MTmULlJIJE,31760,34000,game even by today's standards but
2MTmULlJIJE,34000,36399,forbidden west looks to improve on it in
2MTmULlJIJE,36399,37920,every single way
2MTmULlJIJE,37920,39680,along with character models having more
2MTmULlJIJE,39680,42559,polygons and improved texture details
2MTmULlJIJE,42559,45200,while eloy has some more skeletal joints
2MTmULlJIJE,45200,47039,there are tons of improvements to the
2MTmULlJIJE,47039,49280,effects water rendering environmental
2MTmULlJIJE,49280,52800,details machines i mean the list goes on
2MTmULlJIJE,52800,54960,the ps5 version even has the advantage
2MTmULlJIJE,54960,56960,of using cinematic grade lighting
2MTmULlJIJE,56960,59440,throughout the entire experience while
2MTmULlJIJE,59440,62480,it's only for the cut scenes on the ps4
2MTmULlJIJE,62480,64400,couple all of this with improved
2MTmULlJIJE,64400,66640,cinematics and facial animation for its
2MTmULlJIJE,66640,68640,characters and horizon forbidden west
2MTmULlJIJE,68640,70960,could very well be the best looking game
2MTmULlJIJE,70960,72799,of the year
2MTmULlJIJE,72799,75280,god of war ragnarok
2MTmULlJIJE,75280,77280,much like horizon improving on the
2MTmULlJIJE,77280,79920,perfection in god of war is tough but
2MTmULlJIJE,79920,82400,ragnarok seems more than capable of the
2MTmULlJIJE,82400,83360,same
2MTmULlJIJE,83360,85280,based on the gameplay demo improved
2MTmULlJIJE,85280,87200,texture details and higher polygon
2MTmULlJIJE,87200,89600,models can be seen while environments
2MTmULlJIJE,89600,91920,are packed full of more detail
2MTmULlJIJE,91920,93680,especially when traveling to the newer
2MTmULlJIJE,93680,94799,cities
2MTmULlJIJE,94799,96400,improved water details and weather
2MTmULlJIJE,96400,98320,effects not to mention that series is
2MTmULlJIJE,98320,100400,excellent animation all make for a
2MTmULlJIJE,100400,102880,visually rich experience
2MTmULlJIJE,102880,104560,the trademark single shot camera
2MTmULlJIJE,104560,106799,presentation is also back which feels
2MTmULlJIJE,106799,109520,like the cherry on top
2MTmULlJIJE,109520,112000,gran turismo 7.
2MTmULlJIJE,112000,114159,polyphony digital's gran turismo series
2MTmULlJIJE,114159,116079,has always tried to push the envelope
2MTmULlJIJE,116079,118079,when it comes to realistic visuals
2MTmULlJIJE,118079,120719,dating back to the ps1 era
2MTmULlJIJE,120719,123680,that being said gran turismo 7 looking
2MTmULlJIJE,123680,126799,as good as it does seems almost unreal
2MTmULlJIJE,126799,129280,even though ray tracing is only used in
2MTmULlJIJE,129280,131599,replays and the garage the level at
2MTmULlJIJE,131599,133440,which the tracks and their sky boxes
2MTmULlJIJE,133440,135120,have been rendered not to mention
2MTmULlJIJE,135120,136959,vehicle details and quality of lighting
2MTmULlJIJE,136959,139280,and reflection has to be seen to
2MTmULlJIJE,139280,140480,believed
2MTmULlJIJE,140480,143120,and all of this is running at 4k 60
2MTmULlJIJE,143120,147280,frames per second with hdr enabled
2MTmULlJIJE,147280,149120,pioneer
2MTmULlJIJE,149120,152080,pioneer from gfa games is somewhat akin
2MTmULlJIJE,152080,154879,to stalker while also being a survival
2MTmULlJIJE,154879,158160,mmo its post-apocalyptic world looks
2MTmULlJIJE,158160,160640,fairly detailed and grungy with fine
2MTmULlJIJE,160640,162879,texture detail even if some things like
2MTmULlJIJE,162879,164640,grenade throwing animation still need a
2MTmULlJIJE,164640,167200,bit of work however it captures the
2MTmULlJIJE,167200,169440,dirty underground well with its lighting
2MTmULlJIJE,169440,171599,and shadows while also offering vibrant
2MTmULlJIJE,171599,174319,outdoor scenes lush with greenery it's
2MTmULlJIJE,174319,177680,worth keeping an eye on if nothing else
2MTmULlJIJE,177680,179519,eldon ring
2MTmULlJIJE,179519,181360,from software has always been known for
2MTmULlJIJE,181360,183920,the quality of its art over realistic
2MTmULlJIJE,183920,186400,graphics but perhaps the pressure of
2MTmULlJIJE,186400,188400,elden ring matching the visual quality
2MTmULlJIJE,188400,191120,of blue point's demon souls was more
2MTmULlJIJE,191120,193120,than the developer claimed
2MTmULlJIJE,193120,195280,the lands between and its various
2MTmULlJIJE,195280,197120,denizens whether it's the dragons or
2MTmULlJIJE,197120,198720,hulking giants pulling carriages
2MTmULlJIJE,198720,200959,throughout it is massive and teeming
2MTmULlJIJE,200959,202400,with details
2MTmULlJIJE,202400,204720,you could argue about reused animations
2MTmULlJIJE,204720,207120,and assets but the sheer fidelity
2MTmULlJIJE,207120,209200,combined with the massive draw distance
2MTmULlJIJE,209200,212080,affects quality and character details is
2MTmULlJIJE,212080,214480,still incredible
2MTmULlJIJE,214480,217599,stalker 2 part of chernobyl
2MTmULlJIJE,217599,219599,characters with high polygon counts
2MTmULlJIJE,219599,221360,inverse cinematics for animations
2MTmULlJIJE,221360,224080,physically based material rendering ray
2MTmULlJIJE,224080,226799,traced lighting and reflections there's
2MTmULlJIJE,226799,228720,quite a lot to glean from the gameplay
2MTmULlJIJE,228720,230959,walkthrough of stalker 2 heart of
2MTmULlJIJE,230959,232319,chernobyl
2MTmULlJIJE,232319,235200,it almost looks too good to be true
2MTmULlJIJE,235200,237439,though judging from its delay to april
2MTmULlJIJE,237439,239760,and december some more time is seemingly
2MTmULlJIJE,239760,241840,required to have the whole game up to
2MTmULlJIJE,241840,243680,that level of quality
2MTmULlJIJE,243680,246239,time will tell but it's utterly gorgeous
2MTmULlJIJE,246239,248080,thus far
2MTmULlJIJE,248080,249760,for spoken
2MTmULlJIJE,249760,251760,the latest gameplay trailer for luminous
2MTmULlJIJE,251760,254080,productions for spoken looked a little
2MTmULlJIJE,254080,256479,rough when it came to the frame rate
2MTmULlJIJE,256479,258320,nevertheless everything else from the
2MTmULlJIJE,258320,260720,environmental textures draw distance and
2MTmULlJIJE,260720,262560,character details to the animation
2MTmULlJIJE,262560,264639,quality and special effects
2MTmULlJIJE,264639,266560,looked very good
2MTmULlJIJE,266560,268560,there's still a lot more we need to see
2MTmULlJIJE,268560,270720,but square enix's penchant for stellar
2MTmULlJIJE,270720,273040,cutscenes and strong art design has
2MTmULlJIJE,273040,275280,raised first spoken's profile quite a
2MTmULlJIJE,275280,278560,bit over the past year
2MTmULlJIJE,278560,280560,the day before
2MTmULlJIJE,280560,284240,for a survival mmo the day before sports
2MTmULlJIJE,284240,287120,an insane amount of detail whether one
2MTmULlJIJE,287120,288639,is foraging for supplies in a
2MTmULlJIJE,288639,290960,countryside house or gunning down
2MTmULlJIJE,290960,293360,zombies in a metropolis the latest
2MTmULlJIJE,293360,295199,gameplay reveal which showcased an
2MTmULlJIJE,295199,297199,incredibly rendered city with ray traced
2MTmULlJIJE,297199,299680,reflections and lighting looked very
2MTmULlJIJE,299680,300639,good
2MTmULlJIJE,300639,302160,but even the amount of foliage and
2MTmULlJIJE,302160,303919,vegetation while venturing through a
2MTmULlJIJE,303919,306240,forest was on point in terms of
2MTmULlJIJE,306240,308080,graphical fidelity the day before could
2MTmULlJIJE,308080,311759,very well be a dark horse this year
2MTmULlJIJE,311759,314880,a plague tale requiem
2MTmULlJIJE,314880,317120,the first game surprised many with its
2MTmULlJIJE,317120,319840,visuals with photogrammetry being used
2MTmULlJIJE,319840,322320,to create super detailed environments
2MTmULlJIJE,322320,324240,with stellar ambient lighting and
2MTmULlJIJE,324240,325280,shadows
2MTmULlJIJE,325280,327120,a plague tail requiem seems to be going
2MTmULlJIJE,327120,329600,in the same direction but also offers
2MTmULlJIJE,329600,331600,large environments so better water
2MTmULlJIJE,331600,334240,rendering and improved animations
2MTmULlJIJE,334240,336560,considering it uses unreal engine 5
2MTmULlJIJE,336560,339280,instead of a sobo's proprietary tech we
2MTmULlJIJE,339280,340960,can't wait to see how the sequel
2MTmULlJIJE,340960,343680,leverages it to new heights
2MTmULlJIJE,343680,347360,avatar frontiers of pandora
2MTmULlJIJE,347360,350000,developed on massive's snowdrop engine
2MTmULlJIJE,350000,352400,avatar frontiers of pandora boasts
2MTmULlJIJE,352400,355120,thousands of assets in one frame with
2MTmULlJIJE,355120,357840,detailed environments complex shaders
2MTmULlJIJE,357840,361199,real-time wind simulation and much more
2MTmULlJIJE,361199,363280,a new volumetric cloud system has also
2MTmULlJIJE,363280,365199,been added along with real-time ray
2MTmULlJIJE,365199,367280,tracing for realistic reflections and
2MTmULlJIJE,367280,369680,global illumination the sheer wealth of
2MTmULlJIJE,369680,372319,animations in pcs and detail is already
2MTmULlJIJE,372319,374560,looking promising and should immerse
2MTmULlJIJE,374560,377190,players in pandora like never before
2MTmULlJIJE,377190,379280,[Music]
2MTmULlJIJE,379280,381440,forza motorsport
2MTmULlJIJE,381440,384479,before unveiling forza horizon 5 last
2MTmULlJIJE,384479,386720,year microsoft presented the future of
2MTmULlJIJE,386720,389759,forza motorsport titled well
2MTmULlJIJE,389759,392479,forza motorsport turn 10 studios next
2MTmULlJIJE,392479,394639,big racing sim plays with ray traced
2MTmULlJIJE,394639,396800,lighting effects and reflections all
2MTmULlJIJE,396800,400240,while promising 4k 60fps gameplay
2MTmULlJIJE,400240,402400,the details on these cars looks as
2MTmULlJIJE,402400,403919,immaculate as ever and though the
2MTmULlJIJE,403919,406639,initial trailer was captured in engine
2MTmULlJIJE,406639,408479,the sirius has always had a penchant for
2MTmULlJIJE,408479,410880,achieving exceptional fidelity
2MTmULlJIJE,410880,412800,hopefully we'll get to some real-time
2MTmULlJIJE,412800,414960,gameplay soon
2MTmULlJIJE,414960,417759,the lord of the rings gollum
2MTmULlJIJE,417759,419680,the lord of the rings golem presents a
2MTmULlJIJE,419680,421680,very interesting contrast to the other
2MTmULlJIJE,421680,423919,middle-earth titles we've seen over the
2MTmULlJIJE,423919,424960,years
2MTmULlJIJE,424960,426960,while gollum's character model seems to
2MTmULlJIJE,426960,429199,require more work environments are
2MTmULlJIJE,429199,431440,teeming with strong lighting and shadows
2MTmULlJIJE,431440,433680,not to mention detailed textures to
2MTmULlJIJE,433680,436560,facilitate the darker moodier tone
2MTmULlJIJE,436560,439039,it's still pretty early but looks very
2MTmULlJIJE,439039,441280,good thus far
2MTmULlJIJE,441280,444639,suicide squad kill the justice league
2MTmULlJIJE,444639,446479,rocksteady's reputation for stellar
2MTmULlJIJE,446479,448720,visuals precedes it even if it's
2MTmULlJIJE,448720,450560,optimization for batman arkham knight on
2MTmULlJIJE,450560,453039,pc left much to be desired
2MTmULlJIJE,453039,455039,suicide squad kill the justice league
2MTmULlJIJE,455039,456800,expands on its previous work with
2MTmULlJIJE,456800,459520,incredible draw distance a larger scale
2MTmULlJIJE,459520,461840,stellar effects and more detailed
2MTmULlJIJE,461840,464080,characters it also doesn't hurt that the
2MTmULlJIJE,464080,465919,facial animations and motion capture
2MTmULlJIJE,465919,468400,have been significantly improved making
2MTmULlJIJE,468400,470639,characters look more natural in both cut
2MTmULlJIJE,470639,473120,scenes and gameplay
2MTmULlJIJE,473120,475599,crossfire x
2MTmULlJIJE,475599,477599,despite initial previews of crossfire
2MTmULlJIJE,477599,480240,x's campaign being less than positive
2MTmULlJIJE,480240,482160,there's no denying remedy's talent for
2MTmULlJIJE,482160,484319,stellar visuals thanks to the north
2MTmULlJIJE,484319,486720,light engine the sheer amount of effects
2MTmULlJIJE,486720,488879,objects destruction dynamic lights and
2MTmULlJIJE,488879,491199,shadows is fairly insane
2MTmULlJIJE,491199,493440,throw in some atmospheric fog and wind
2MTmULlJIJE,493440,495840,not to mention detailed particles and
2MTmULlJIJE,495840,497360,it's one of the better looking first
2MTmULlJIJE,497360,500240,person shooters of the year
2MTmULlJIJE,500240,502639,gotham knights
2MTmULlJIJE,502639,504879,in terms of presentation gotham knights
2MTmULlJIJE,504879,507440,feels a lot closer to the batman arkham
2MTmULlJIJE,507440,510639,series of yore than rockstudy's upcoming
2MTmULlJIJE,510639,513680,suicide squad and while 2020's gameplay
2MTmULlJIJE,513680,515120,walkthrough was still early in
2MTmULlJIJE,515120,517120,development it came off quite well with
2MTmULlJIJE,517120,519680,its animation quality environment design
2MTmULlJIJE,519680,521680,textures and effects
2MTmULlJIJE,521680,523360,details like dynamic lighting and
2MTmULlJIJE,523360,525519,shadows atmospheric fog and ambient
2MTmULlJIJE,525519,527920,occlusion also looked good so it should
2MTmULlJIJE,527920,529839,look even better as we approach its
2MTmULlJIJE,529839,532160,launch this year

2MTmULlJIJE,4880,8559,2022 is a big year for gaming both in
2MTmULlJIJE,8559,10719,sheer volume of releases and the hype

2MTmULlJIJE,29359,31760,horizon zero dawn is a great looking
2MTmULlJIJE,31760,34000,game even by today's standards but
2MTmULlJIJE,34000,36399,forbidden west looks to improve on it in
2MTmULlJIJE,36399,37920,every single way
2MTmULlJIJE,37920,39680,along with character models having more
2MTmULlJIJE,39680,42559,polygons and improved texture details

2MTmULlJIJE,54960,56960,of using cinematic grade lighting
2MTmULlJIJE,56960,59440,throughout the entire experience while
2MTmULlJIJE,59440,62480,it's only for the cut scenes on the ps4
2MTmULlJIJE,62480,64400,couple all of this with improved
2MTmULlJIJE,64400,66640,cinematics and facial animation for its
2MTmULlJIJE,66640,68640,characters and horizon forbidden west
2MTmULlJIJE,68640,70960,could very well be the best looking game
2MTmULlJIJE,70960,72799,of the year
2MTmULlJIJE,72799,75280,god of war ragnarok
2MTmULlJIJE,75280,77280,much like horizon improving on the
2MTmULlJIJE,77280,79920,perfection in god of war is tough but
2MTmULlJIJE,79920,82400,ragnarok seems more than capable of the
2MTmULlJIJE,82400,83360,same
2MTmULlJIJE,83360,85280,based on the gameplay demo improved
2MTmULlJIJE,85280,87200,texture details and higher polygon
2MTmULlJIJE,87200,89600,models can be seen while environments
2MTmULlJIJE,89600,91920,are packed full of more detail
2MTmULlJIJE,91920,93680,especially when traveling to the newer
2MTmULlJIJE,93680,94799,cities
2MTmULlJIJE,94799,96400,improved water details and weather
2MTmULlJIJE,96400,98320,effects not to mention that series is
2MTmULlJIJE,98320,100400,excellent animation all make for a
2MTmULlJIJE,100400,102880,visually rich experience
2MTmULlJIJE,102880,104560,the trademark single shot camera
2MTmULlJIJE,104560,106799,presentation is also back which feels
2MTmULlJIJE,106799,109520,like the cherry on top
2MTmULlJIJE,109520,112000,gran turismo 7.
2MTmULlJIJE,112000,114159,polyphony digital's gran turismo series
2MTmULlJIJE,114159,116079,has always tried to push the envelope
2MTmULlJIJE,116079,118079,when it comes to realistic visuals
2MTmULlJIJE,118079,120719,dating back to the ps1 era
2MTmULlJIJE,120719,123680,that being said gran turismo 7 looking
2MTmULlJIJE,123680,126799,as good as it does seems almost unreal
2MTmULlJIJE,126799,129280,even though ray tracing is only used in
2MTmULlJIJE,129280,131599,replays and the garage the level at
2MTmULlJIJE,131599,133440,which the tracks and their sky boxes
2MTmULlJIJE,133440,135120,have been rendered not to mention
2MTmULlJIJE,135120,136959,vehicle details and quality of lighting
2MTmULlJIJE,136959,139280,and reflection has to be seen to
2MTmULlJIJE,139280,140480,believed
2MTmULlJIJE,140480,143120,and all of this is running at 4k 60
2MTmULlJIJE,143120,147280,frames per second with hdr enabled
2MTmULlJIJE,147280,149120,pioneer
2MTmULlJIJE,149120,152080,pioneer from gfa games is somewhat akin
2MTmULlJIJE,152080,154879,to stalker while also being a survival
2MTmULlJIJE,154879,158160,mmo its post-apocalyptic world looks
2MTmULlJIJE,158160,160640,fairly detailed and grungy with fine
2MTmULlJIJE,160640,162879,texture detail even if some things like
2MTmULlJIJE,162879,164640,grenade throwing animation still need a
2MTmULlJIJE,164640,167200,bit of work however it captures the
2MTmULlJIJE,167200,169440,dirty underground well with its lighting
2MTmULlJIJE,169440,171599,and shadows while also offering vibrant
2MTmULlJIJE,171599,174319,outdoor scenes lush with greenery it's
2MTmULlJIJE,174319,177680,worth keeping an eye on if nothing else
2MTmULlJIJE,177680,179519,eldon ring
2MTmULlJIJE,179519,181360,from software has always been known for
2MTmULlJIJE,181360,183920,the quality of its art over realistic
2MTmULlJIJE,183920,186400,graphics but perhaps the pressure of
2MTmULlJIJE,186400,188400,elden ring matching the visual quality
2MTmULlJIJE,188400,191120,of blue point's demon souls was more
2MTmULlJIJE,191120,193120,than the developer claimed
2MTmULlJIJE,193120,195280,the lands between and its various
2MTmULlJIJE,195280,197120,denizens whether it's the dragons or
2MTmULlJIJE,197120,198720,hulking giants pulling carriages
2MTmULlJIJE,198720,200959,throughout it is massive and teeming
2MTmULlJIJE,200959,202400,with details
2MTmULlJIJE,202400,204720,you could argue about reused animations
2MTmULlJIJE,204720,207120,and assets but the sheer fidelity
2MTmULlJIJE,207120,209200,combined with the massive draw distance
2MTmULlJIJE,209200,212080,affects quality and character details is
2MTmULlJIJE,212080,214480,still incredible
2MTmULlJIJE,214480,217599,stalker 2 part of chernobyl
2MTmULlJIJE,217599,219599,characters with high polygon counts
2MTmULlJIJE,219599,221360,inverse cinematics for animations
2MTmULlJIJE,221360,224080,physically based material rendering ray
2MTmULlJIJE,224080,226799,traced lighting and reflections there's
2MTmULlJIJE,226799,228720,quite a lot to glean from the gameplay
2MTmULlJIJE,228720,230959,walkthrough of stalker 2 heart of
2MTmULlJIJE,230959,232319,chernobyl
2MTmULlJIJE,232319,235200,it almost looks too good to be true
2MTmULlJIJE,235200,237439,though judging from its delay to april
2MTmULlJIJE,237439,239760,and december some more time is seemingly
2MTmULlJIJE,239760,241840,required to have the whole game up to
2MTmULlJIJE,241840,243680,that level of quality
2MTmULlJIJE,243680,246239,time will tell but it's utterly gorgeous
2MTmULlJIJE,246239,248080,thus far
2MTmULlJIJE,248080,249760,for spoken
2MTmULlJIJE,249760,251760,the latest gameplay trailer for luminous
2MTmULlJIJE,251760,254080,productions for spoken looked a little
2MTmULlJIJE,254080,256479,rough when it came to the frame rate
2MTmULlJIJE,256479,258320,nevertheless everything else from the
2MTmULlJIJE,258320,260720,environmental textures draw distance and
2MTmULlJIJE,260720,262560,character details to the animation
2MTmULlJIJE,262560,264639,quality and special effects
2MTmULlJIJE,264639,266560,looked very good
2MTmULlJIJE,266560,268560,there's still a lot more we need to see
2MTmULlJIJE,268560,270720,but square enix's penchant for stellar
2MTmULlJIJE,270720,273040,cutscenes and strong art design has
2MTmULlJIJE,273040,275280,raised first spoken's profile quite a
2MTmULlJIJE,275280,278560,bit over the past year
2MTmULlJIJE,278560,280560,the day before
2MTmULlJIJE,280560,284240,for a survival mmo the day before sports
2MTmULlJIJE,284240,287120,an insane amount of detail whether one
2MTmULlJIJE,287120,288639,is foraging for supplies in a
2MTmULlJIJE,288639,290960,countryside house or gunning down
2MTmULlJIJE,290960,293360,zombies in a metropolis the latest
2MTmULlJIJE,293360,295199,gameplay reveal which showcased an
2MTmULlJIJE,295199,297199,incredibly rendered city with ray traced
2MTmULlJIJE,297199,299680,reflections and lighting looked very
2MTmULlJIJE,299680,300639,good
2MTmULlJIJE,300639,302160,but even the amount of foliage and
2MTmULlJIJE,302160,303919,vegetation while venturing through a
2MTmULlJIJE,303919,306240,forest was on point in terms of
2MTmULlJIJE,306240,308080,graphical fidelity the day before could
2MTmULlJIJE,308080,311759,very well be a dark horse this year
2MTmULlJIJE,311759,314880,a plague tale requiem
2MTmULlJIJE,314880,317120,the first game surprised many with its
2MTmULlJIJE,317120,319840,visuals with photogrammetry being used
2MTmULlJIJE,319840,322320,to create super detailed environments
2MTmULlJIJE,322320,324240,with stellar ambient lighting and
2MTmULlJIJE,324240,325280,shadows
2MTmULlJIJE,325280,327120,a plague tail requiem seems to be going
2MTmULlJIJE,327120,329600,in the same direction but also offers
2MTmULlJIJE,329600,331600,large environments so better water
2MTmULlJIJE,331600,334240,rendering and improved animations
2MTmULlJIJE,334240,336560,considering it uses unreal engine 5
2MTmULlJIJE,336560,339280,instead of a sobo's proprietary tech we
2MTmULlJIJE,339280,340960,can't wait to see how the sequel
2MTmULlJIJE,340960,343680,leverages it to new heights
2MTmULlJIJE,343680,347360,avatar frontiers of pandora
2MTmULlJIJE,347360,350000,developed on massive's snowdrop engine
2MTmULlJIJE,350000,352400,avatar frontiers of pandora boasts
2MTmULlJIJE,352400,355120,thousands of assets in one frame with
2MTmULlJIJE,355120,357840,detailed environments complex shaders
2MTmULlJIJE,357840,361199,real-time wind simulation and much more
2MTmULlJIJE,361199,363280,a new volumetric cloud system has also
2MTmULlJIJE,363280,365199,been added along with real-time ray
2MTmULlJIJE,365199,367280,tracing for realistic reflections and
2MTmULlJIJE,367280,369680,global illumination the sheer wealth of
2MTmULlJIJE,369680,372319,animations in pcs and detail is already
2MTmULlJIJE,372319,374560,looking promising and should immerse
2MTmULlJIJE,374560,377190,players in pandora like never before

2MTmULlJIJE,379280,381440,forza motorsport
2MTmULlJIJE,381440,384479,before unveiling forza horizon 5 last
2MTmULlJIJE,384479,386720,year microsoft presented the future of
2MTmULlJIJE,386720,389759,forza motorsport titled well
2MTmULlJIJE,389759,392479,forza motorsport turn 10 studios next

2MTmULlJIJE,396800,400240,while promising 4k 60fps gameplay
2MTmULlJIJE,400240,402400,the details on these cars looks as
2MTmULlJIJE,402400,403919,immaculate as ever and though the
2MTmULlJIJE,403919,406639,initial trailer was captured in engine
2MTmULlJIJE,406639,408479,the sirius has always had a penchant for
2MTmULlJIJE,408479,410880,achieving exceptional fidelity
2MTmULlJIJE,410880,412800,hopefully we'll get to some real-time
2MTmULlJIJE,412800,414960,gameplay soon
2MTmULlJIJE,414960,417759,the lord of the rings gollum
2MTmULlJIJE,417759,419680,the lord of the rings golem presents a
2MTmULlJIJE,419680,421680,very interesting contrast to the other
2MTmULlJIJE,421680,423919,middle-earth titles we've seen over the
2MTmULlJIJE,423919,424960,years
2MTmULlJIJE,424960,426960,while gollum's character model seems to
2MTmULlJIJE,426960,429199,require more work environments are
2MTmULlJIJE,429199,431440,teeming with strong lighting and shadows
2MTmULlJIJE,431440,433680,not to mention detailed textures to
2MTmULlJIJE,433680,436560,facilitate the darker moodier tone
2MTmULlJIJE,436560,439039,it's still pretty early but looks very
2MTmULlJIJE,439039,441280,good thus far
2MTmULlJIJE,441280,444639,suicide squad kill the justice league
2MTmULlJIJE,444639,446479,rocksteady's reputation for stellar
2MTmULlJIJE,446479,448720,visuals precedes it even if it's
2MTmULlJIJE,448720,450560,optimization for batman arkham knight on
2MTmULlJIJE,450560,453039,pc left much to be desired
2MTmULlJIJE,453039,455039,suicide squad kill the justice league
2MTmULlJIJE,455039,456800,expands on its previous work with
2MTmULlJIJE,456800,459520,incredible draw distance a larger scale
2MTmULlJIJE,459520,461840,stellar effects and more detailed
2MTmULlJIJE,461840,464080,characters it also doesn't hurt that the
2MTmULlJIJE,464080,465919,facial animations and motion capture
2MTmULlJIJE,465919,468400,have been significantly improved making
2MTmULlJIJE,468400,470639,characters look more natural in both cut
2MTmULlJIJE,470639,473120,scenes and gameplay
2MTmULlJIJE,473120,475599,crossfire x
2MTmULlJIJE,475599,477599,despite initial previews of crossfire
2MTmULlJIJE,477599,480240,x's campaign being less than positive
2MTmULlJIJE,480240,482160,there's no denying remedy's talent for
2MTmULlJIJE,482160,484319,stellar visuals thanks to the north
2MTmULlJIJE,484319,486720,light engine the sheer amount of effects
2MTmULlJIJE,486720,488879,objects destruction dynamic lights and
2MTmULlJIJE,488879,491199,shadows is fairly insane
2MTmULlJIJE,491199,493440,throw in some atmospheric fog and wind
2MTmULlJIJE,493440,495840,not to mention detailed particles and
2MTmULlJIJE,495840,497360,it's one of the better looking first
2MTmULlJIJE,497360,500240,person shooters of the year
2MTmULlJIJE,500240,502639,gotham knights
2MTmULlJIJE,502639,504879,in terms of presentation gotham knights
2MTmULlJIJE,504879,507440,feels a lot closer to the batman arkham
2MTmULlJIJE,507440,510639,series of yore than rockstudy's upcoming
2MTmULlJIJE,510639,513680,suicide squad and while 2020's gameplay
2MTmULlJIJE,513680,515120,walkthrough was still early in
2MTmULlJIJE,515120,517120,development it came off quite well with
2MTmULlJIJE,517120,519680,its animation quality environment design
2MTmULlJIJE,519680,521680,textures and effects
2MTmULlJIJE,521680,523360,details like dynamic lighting and
2MTmULlJIJE,523360,525519,shadows atmospheric fog and ambient
2MTmULlJIJE,525519,527920,occlusion also looked good so it should
2MTmULlJIJE,527920,529839,look even better as we approach its
2MTmULlJIJE,529839,532160,launch this year
