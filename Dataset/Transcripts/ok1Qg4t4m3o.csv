ok1Qg4t4m3o,10000,13170,[Music]
ok1Qg4t4m3o,15440,16800,captain there's something wrong with the
ok1Qg4t4m3o,16800,18960,ship
ok1Qg4t4m3o,23680,26240,tweek any idea what just happened i've
ok1Qg4t4m3o,26240,28720,already found the problem cap it's the
ok1Qg4t4m3o,28720,31039,bubble converter it's broken and the
ok1Qg4t4m3o,31039,33760,octopod can't take off without it can't
ok1Qg4t4m3o,33760,37040,you just make a new one matey i could
ok1Qg4t4m3o,37040,38879,but that would take days
ok1Qg4t4m3o,38879,43160,or months months
ok1Qg4t4m3o,44239,46239,it looks like we don't have days or
ok1Qg4t4m3o,46239,48879,months we've got to do something now
ok1Qg4t4m3o,48879,52239,there is one other bubble converter ah
ok1Qg4t4m3o,52239,54559,you mean uh-huh
ok1Qg4t4m3o,54559,58879,of course the old octopod
ok1Qg4t4m3o,58879,60879,what old octopod
ok1Qg4t4m3o,60879,63600,uh did we not mention this is actually
ok1Qg4t4m3o,63600,65680,the second octopod
ok1Qg4t4m3o,65680,68320,no matey i think i'd remember another
ok1Qg4t4m3o,68320,71840,octopod oh well then this here's the new
ok1Qg4t4m3o,71840,74799,octopod but way back when before we were
ok1Qg4t4m3o,74799,77360,even the octonauts there was an old
ok1Qg4t4m3o,77360,80720,octopod it never did work quite right
ok1Qg4t4m3o,80720,81759,well
ok1Qg4t4m3o,81759,84320,we crashed it but when we came back to
ok1Qg4t4m3o,84320,87759,fix it it had become an artificial reef
ok1Qg4t4m3o,87759,90560,home to hundreds of creatures so we had
ok1Qg4t4m3o,90560,93280,to leave it where it was the old octopod
ok1Qg4t4m3o,93280,95280,should still have a working bubble
ok1Qg4t4m3o,95280,97759,converter then there's no time to lose
ok1Qg4t4m3o,97759,101560,to the gup a
ok1Qg4t4m3o,102000,104159,dashie keep an eye on the ship we'll be

ok1Qg4t4m3o,355520,360319,squirts ink and it's orange hmm
ok1Qg4t4m3o,360639,363919,sounds like a giant pacific octopus i
ok1Qg4t4m3o,363919,364960,agree
ok1Qg4t4m3o,364960,367199,my pacific cousins are the largest
ok1Qg4t4m3o,367199,369440,species of octopus
ok1Qg4t4m3o,369440,371360,and they often make their homes in old
ok1Qg4t4m3o,371360,373280,abandoned ships
ok1Qg4t4m3o,373280,375840,well how about that i modeled the
ok1Qg4t4m3o,375840,378800,octopod after the giant pacific octopus
ok1Qg4t4m3o,378800,381600,and now there's one living in it yeah
ok1Qg4t4m3o,381600,384160,but why did it steal our converter it
ok1Qg4t4m3o,384160,386720,was probably just curious giant pacific
ok1Qg4t4m3o,386720,388639,octopuses are very clever and they
ok1Qg4t4m3o,388639,391440,always investigate new things hmm
ok1Qg4t4m3o,391440,393360,then maybe we can give it something new
ok1Qg4t4m3o,393360,396560,to be curious about
ok1Qg4t4m3o,397840,400560,its attention and then when it comes to
ok1Qg4t4m3o,400560,402639,investigate
ok1Qg4t4m3o,402639,405840,we'll get our converter everybody into
