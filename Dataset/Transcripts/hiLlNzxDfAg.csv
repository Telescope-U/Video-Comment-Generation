hiLlNzxDfAg,60,2669,if I were to say the word hoarder you'd
hiLlNzxDfAg,2669,5069,probably think of like those reality TV
hiLlNzxDfAg,5069,7170,shows where there's a bunch of boxes
hiLlNzxDfAg,7170,9510,everywhere and there's junk strewn all
hiLlNzxDfAg,9510,11490,over the place and there's like bugs and
hiLlNzxDfAg,11490,13250,rotting food and everything is just
hiLlNzxDfAg,13250,17880,gross Carolinas well Bryan the
hiLlNzxDfAg,17880,20820,electrician he's always been a little
hiLlNzxDfAg,20820,23400,different but he's also a different kind
hiLlNzxDfAg,23400,27680,of hoarder so take a step inside Bryan's
hiLlNzxDfAg,27680,29910,domicile here where we're gonna see

hiLlNzxDfAg,195830,201440,goodness what hell is this this is very
hiLlNzxDfAg,201440,204190,early LCD technology I feel like a tech
hiLlNzxDfAg,204190,206709,archaeologist like what is this 2005
hiLlNzxDfAg,206709,209150,property of blessings Christian
hiLlNzxDfAg,209150,213050,marketplace oh that's from Michelle's
hiLlNzxDfAg,213050,216470,old work manufactured January 2004 yeah
hiLlNzxDfAg,216470,218150,I would accuse you of stealing it but
hiLlNzxDfAg,218150,219950,I'm sure they didn't want it anymore
hiLlNzxDfAg,219950,223130,and that was 10 years ago oh my goodness
hiLlNzxDfAg,223130,227330,is this a PCMCIA card yes it is
hiLlNzxDfAg,227330,229820,I love that they called 10/100
hiLlNzxDfAg,229820,233260,fastethernet because that is not fast
hiLlNzxDfAg,233260,236000,okay I could give you a pass on the
hiLlNzxDfAg,236000,237650,extra mouse in the living room but this
hiLlNzxDfAg,237650,239630,is three mice and three keyboards on a
hiLlNzxDfAg,239630,243860,utility sink yeah to be cleaned to be
hiLlNzxDfAg,243860,248030,cleaned okay this is a three button
hiLlNzxDfAg,248030,251090,Mouse with no scroll wheel yeah the best
hiLlNzxDfAg,251090,254209,way to clean Matt is in a melting fat so
hiLlNzxDfAg,254209,255920,they can reuse the plastics to make
hiLlNzxDfAg,255920,258590,something modern and useful is that I've
hiLlNzxDfAg,258590,269060,had one oh my goodness I forgot how
hiLlNzxDfAg,269060,272270,chunky this thing was how thick this
hiLlNzxDfAg,272270,274640,thing is and I actually thought we were
hiLlNzxDfAg,274640,276140,done in this corner and I was looking
hiLlNzxDfAg,276140,277700,under the desk I was like okay you got
hiLlNzxDfAg,277700,280220,your AC but what is this why is there a
hiLlNzxDfAg,280220,283669,CD drive down there it's no there's no
hiLlNzxDfAg,283669,285500,good reason you may see you may stop the
hiLlNzxDfAg,285500,287900,cleaning there is is to keep the pedals
hiLlNzxDfAg,287900,289130,from moving back when I'm playing the
hiLlNzxDfAg,289130,291770,key driving pedals from moving back yeah
hiLlNzxDfAg,291770,294020,the pedal bunts against the driver we're
hiLlNzxDfAg,294020,296570,really using it as a doorstop yes that a
hiLlNzxDfAg,296570,300620,CD changer why don't you have Spotify
hiLlNzxDfAg,300620,302990,sir actually I'm just using that as an
hiLlNzxDfAg,302990,305539,amp all right now we're into what is
hiLlNzxDfAg,305539,309770,very obviously the wifey PC so I
hiLlNzxDfAg,309770,311360,couldn't help noticing that she doesn't
hiLlNzxDfAg,311360,313450,have nearly as good a rig as you
hiLlNzxDfAg,313450,316420,I saw that minecraft is struggling a
hiLlNzxDfAg,316420,317920,little bit there what's your excuse sir
hiLlNzxDfAg,317920,319840,my excuses doesn't have this much tech
hiLlNzxDfAg,319840,322180,and you're not gonna have her minecraft
hiLlNzxDfAg,322180,325570,running at a hundred plus fps that's the
hiLlNzxDfAg,325570,328150,interim PC I have another one in the
hiLlNzxDfAg,328150,330160,workshop that I've built for we're gonna
hiLlNzxDfAg,330160,332320,see if that story checks out at least
hiLlNzxDfAg,332320,337120,she's got a laptop I'm gonna have an
hiLlNzxDfAg,337120,339730,older model Toughbook a second gen i5 oh
hiLlNzxDfAg,339730,341620,it doesn't have you have a USB 3 dude
hiLlNzxDfAg,341620,343810,that's a tough book doesn't need USB 3
hiLlNzxDfAg,343810,346360,to be cool what do you think guys do I
hiLlNzxDfAg,346360,348040,look cool if I do it's not the laptop
hiLlNzxDfAg,348040,351540,LTT store.com anyway this is a second
hiLlNzxDfAg,351540,354640,home theater PC yeah there's nothing
hiLlNzxDfAg,354640,357160,wrong with a TV in the basement but come
hiLlNzxDfAg,357160,360400,on man more than one home theater PC
hiLlNzxDfAg,360400,363910,also know them all so jump is not a
hiLlNzxDfAg,363910,367270,problem 2 amps is a problem this one's
hiLlNzxDfAg,367270,370570,not hooked up and this one is not hooked
hiLlNzxDfAg,370570,376720,up not yet what is this elite I had a
hiLlNzxDfAg,376720,380530,laser jet 6 P store 10 years ago and it
hiLlNzxDfAg,380530,382690,was used you guys may not know this is a
hiLlNzxDfAg,382690,385780,gravity-fed model laser printer which
hiLlNzxDfAg,385780,387760,means that the print reliability while
hiLlNzxDfAg,387760,391240,the text is very crisp the toner
hiLlNzxDfAg,391240,393820,cartridge in this I got filled back when
hiLlNzxDfAg,393820,395680,I was in high school for $40.00 and it's
hiLlNzxDfAg,395680,397360,still on the same fill right but that's
hiLlNzxDfAg,397360,399310,cuz you're not actually using it not
hiLlNzxDfAg,399310,401190,right now I use it for a lot of years
hiLlNzxDfAg,401190,403990,still going so I'm gonna have to knock a
hiLlNzxDfAg,403990,405790,few more points off for these speakers
hiLlNzxDfAg,405790,407830,that are next to a TV but not actually
hiLlNzxDfAg,407830,411300,hooked up not yet
hiLlNzxDfAg,411450,415150,and now it's time for the workshop now
hiLlNzxDfAg,415150,418060,yeah so far this has been I'd say a
hiLlNzxDfAg,418060,421090,moderate case of tech hoarding but my
hiLlNzxDfAg,421090,422560,understanding based on all the things
hiLlNzxDfAg,422560,424090,Brian claims to be working on all the
hiLlNzxDfAg,424090,426460,time is that there's definitely another
hiLlNzxDfAg,426460,428290,level that we can ratchet up to here
hiLlNzxDfAg,428290,433330,you'll see oh ha ha very funny Justine
hiLlNzxDfAg,433330,438070,oh my goodness oh man okay
hiLlNzxDfAg,438070,441640,where do we even start here what do you
hiLlNzxDfAg,441640,445900,have a box machine for that is the
hiLlNzxDfAg,445900,447910,minecraft server and does this minecraft
hiLlNzxDfAg,447910,449560,server actually serve to anyone outside
hiLlNzxDfAg,449560,451990,of this house yes oh it does okay so
hiLlNzxDfAg,451990,453370,you're running your own minecraft server
hiLlNzxDfAg,453370,454000,yep
hiLlNzxDfAg,454000,458070,out of this by the way very nice love it
hiLlNzxDfAg,458070,462070,wooden server cabinet just as long as
hiLlNzxDfAg,462070,465010,you don't have a fire everything's fine
hiLlNzxDfAg,465010,467350,the top one is storage all right how
hiLlNzxDfAg,467350,469630,much storage is in here right now three
hiLlNzxDfAg,469630,472090,terabytes you have an entire for you for
hiLlNzxDfAg,472090,474490,three terabytes of storage it's also
hiLlNzxDfAg,474490,476380,redundant all the drives are in red one
hiLlNzxDfAg,476380,478660,holy smokes
hiLlNzxDfAg,478660,480850,so do you just like rock out in here
hiLlNzxDfAg,480850,483130,what is this what is this amplifier you
hiLlNzxDfAg,483130,485320,got going on here I need better speakers
hiLlNzxDfAg,485320,487530,to go with it I'll see that right now
hiLlNzxDfAg,487530,491740,but that's a 500 watt 2-channel Rotel so
hiLlNzxDfAg,491740,496260,there are already some fascinating
hiLlNzxDfAg,496260,499270,relics in here this AIO
hiLlNzxDfAg,499270,503860,has got to be at least fifteen years old
hiLlNzxDfAg,503860,506530,that is a first gen i3 that's a machine
hiLlNzxDfAg,506530,508450,Michelle was using I just need to make
hiLlNzxDfAg,508450,510010,sure there's no pictures on it before it
hiLlNzxDfAg,510010,512380,goes to recycling more wrapping paper
hiLlNzxDfAg,512380,514539,very funny I couldn't help noticing that
hiLlNzxDfAg,514539,518020,there was an entire list of software
hiLlNzxDfAg,518020,520539,serial Keys some of it useful some of it
hiLlNzxDfAg,520539,523330,probably less useful PC saloon Internet
hiLlNzxDfAg,523330,525610,Security 2008 I remember that as a
hiLlNzxDfAg,525610,527230,classic that's when I started that
hiLlNzxDfAg,527230,531180,database Sims - wow you own the entire
hiLlNzxDfAg,531180,534700,Sims 2 series and you solemnly swear
hiLlNzxDfAg,534700,536860,every single one of these keys is legit
hiLlNzxDfAg,536860,540370,yes all right I don't worry about
hiLlNzxDfAg,540370,546550,windows 95 windows 98 and 98 SC okay now
hiLlNzxDfAg,546550,548350,this is something I think we can all
hiLlNzxDfAg,548350,551530,agree can just be thrown away so you
hiLlNzxDfAg,551530,553840,work with an electronics recycler but to
hiLlNzxDfAg,553840,557530,do what to just hoard more uh yeah it's
hiLlNzxDfAg,557530,561580,like yeah I rescued machines I find
hiLlNzxDfAg,561580,562900,interesting that I actually have an
hiLlNzxDfAg,562900,565390,interest in as well as any stuff that I
hiLlNzxDfAg,565390,566800,don't have room for or I've lost
hiLlNzxDfAg,566800,568480,interest in or that doesn't work I just
hiLlNzxDfAg,568480,569820,I'm able to bring it back
hiLlNzxDfAg,569820,572160,get rid of it got it got it the
hiLlNzxDfAg,572160,574290,motherboard on the wall behind this
hiLlNzxDfAg,574290,576690,screen yeah that was my first machine
hiLlNzxDfAg,576690,579360,really that board was in a computer that
hiLlNzxDfAg,579360,581730,my dad bought new in 95 Wow
hiLlNzxDfAg,581730,583800,and then when he got a machine to
hiLlNzxDfAg,583800,586260,replace that it was handed down to me
hiLlNzxDfAg,586260,587880,since then the Braille battery leaked
hiLlNzxDfAg,587880,589020,out onto the board direct some of the
hiLlNzxDfAg,589020,592230,traces I hoped to find another one but I
hiLlNzxDfAg,592230,593850,still have the rest of that machine
hiLlNzxDfAg,593850,595890,which is up on the shelf that's the old
hiLlNzxDfAg,595890,597780,contacts Oh interesting
hiLlNzxDfAg,597780,602070,so that machine started all this look
hiLlNzxDfAg,602070,604890,what you did Oh interesting so this is
hiLlNzxDfAg,604890,608730,like VGA capture what could you possibly
hiLlNzxDfAg,608730,611250,hope to do with this kind of stuff well
hiLlNzxDfAg,611250,614070,at least this one's got VR out some of
hiLlNzxDfAg,614070,615510,this stuff wasn't even good when it was
hiLlNzxDfAg,615510,618090,new sound cards how's that for a sound
hiLlNzxDfAg,618090,621420,card look at this thing it's got a RAM
hiLlNzxDfAg,621420,626730,slot on it well dwe 32 look at that gold
hiLlNzxDfAg,626730,628770,star didn't they become something else
hiLlNzxDfAg,628770,631800,eventually LG that's right lucky gold
hiLlNzxDfAg,631800,635610,star nut so this is from 1995 so if
hiLlNzxDfAg,635610,636870,you're complaining about how you're
hiLlNzxDfAg,636870,640140,you're you know RTX whatever doesn't fit
hiLlNzxDfAg,640140,642270,in your case and needs to be so big so
hiLlNzxDfAg,642270,643950,this is a modern graphics card yeah it's
hiLlNzxDfAg,643950,645870,a little bit on the thicker side but in
hiLlNzxDfAg,645870,647370,terms of the actual length
hiLlNzxDfAg,647370,651030,oh is this Quattro 6000 work I does
hiLlNzxDfAg,651030,653220,display I haven't booted windows up with
hiLlNzxDfAg,653220,658160,it yeah damn Daniel okay fluffy and
hiLlNzxDfAg,658160,659490,iptables
hiLlNzxDfAg,659490,663570,yep oh no thermal paste rag in here got
hiLlNzxDfAg,663570,666270,some random modular power supply cables
hiLlNzxDfAg,666270,668640,yeah that's more ribbon cables that
hiLlNzxDfAg,668640,670710,overflow that's the mix drawer so
hiLlNzxDfAg,670710,672240,there's actually some decent stuff in
hiLlNzxDfAg,672240,675090,here that's an HX 1000 yep piles upon
hiLlNzxDfAg,675090,677430,piles of AMD coolers this is like some
hiLlNzxDfAg,677430,681750,socket holy crap this is socket 462 so
hiLlNzxDfAg,681750,683790,basically that's why you have three
hiLlNzxDfAg,683790,685860,terabytes of space because this is all
hiLlNzxDfAg,685860,688530,just like recycled recycled drives and
hiLlNzxDfAg,688530,690570,that's why you run RAID one yeah because
hiLlNzxDfAg,690570,693000,this is all recycled drives exactly
hiLlNzxDfAg,693000,698100,this is Fujitsu 2.5 7 gigabytes yes my
hiLlNzxDfAg,698100,701340,friends this is back when you know a
hiLlNzxDfAg,701340,704329,hundred or even 10 Meg's really counted
hiLlNzxDfAg,704329,708990,or this one Seagate medalist 631 Meg's
hiLlNzxDfAg,708990,711420,so this is probably similar to the drive
hiLlNzxDfAg,711420,713699,that was in my family's first computer
hiLlNzxDfAg,713699,716519,yeah so this is probably around the the
hiLlNzxDfAg,716519,718170,neighborhood of my family's like
hiLlNzxDfAg,718170,721079,upgraded drive in our 386 so we talked
hiLlNzxDfAg,721079,723000,about these actually in our drive savers
hiLlNzxDfAg,723000,724800,video they actually have a ton of old
hiLlNzxDfAg,724800,727139,stuff like this lying around that is in
hiLlNzxDfAg,727139,728670,working order because they never know
hiLlNzxDfAg,728670,730860,when they're gonna get like a nuclear
hiLlNzxDfAg,730860,733019,power plant or something that's still
hiLlNzxDfAg,733019,734699,running hardware from this generation
hiLlNzxDfAg,734699,737790,that's like hey our drive died we need
hiLlNzxDfAg,737790,739199,to get the data off of it
hiLlNzxDfAg,739199,741509,so I feel like there has to be a rhyme
hiLlNzxDfAg,741509,744839,or reason to this the very very top is
hiLlNzxDfAg,744839,749250,old more much more vintage socket seven
hiLlNzxDfAg,749250,753720,socket three outboard cache yeah Wow
hiLlNzxDfAg,753720,757769,Coast module so guys cash didn't used to
hiLlNzxDfAg,757769,759899,be integrated right next to the CPU
hiLlNzxDfAg,759899,762439,instead you had to actually install
hiLlNzxDfAg,762439,765300,cache now the the theoretical benefit of
hiLlNzxDfAg,765300,767459,this is that if your CPU didn't have
hiLlNzxDfAg,767459,768630,enough cash for your workload
hiLlNzxDfAg,768630,771060,theoretically you could upgrade it with
hiLlNzxDfAg,771060,773759,more cash down the line optical drives
hiLlNzxDfAg,773759,777329,for days I just purged a bunch too did
hiLlNzxDfAg,777329,780449,you know yes couldn't tell got some of
hiLlNzxDfAg,780449,783529,them iMac power cables do these work
hiLlNzxDfAg,783529,786329,those ones I think of graphics issues so
hiLlNzxDfAg,786329,788040,I'm probably just gonna solve which the
hiLlNzxDfAg,788040,789800,drives and RAM out of them one bomber
hiLlNzxDfAg,789800,791850,that's the thing about all-in-one
hiLlNzxDfAg,791850,794399,computers that's so frustrating and
hiLlNzxDfAg,794399,797189,wasteful Hey yep as soon as they stop
hiLlNzxDfAg,797189,798600,working you can't even use them as a
hiLlNzxDfAg,798600,800459,monitor although some of the older IMAX
hiLlNzxDfAg,800459,801660,I think you could but not the New
hiLlNzxDfAg,801660,804500,Orleans anymore is that an EPC manual
hiLlNzxDfAg,804500,807120,why would you even have why would you
hiLlNzxDfAg,807120,808470,care about that why would you keep this
hiLlNzxDfAg,808470,811139,because I actually have one a friend
hiLlNzxDfAg,811139,812819,gave me well yeah but you donate the
hiLlNzxDfAg,812819,816600,manual just powering on your EPC install
hiLlNzxDfAg,816600,817949,the battery pack connect the AC power
hiLlNzxDfAg,817949,820050,cord turn on the EPC I've never actually
hiLlNzxDfAg,820050,823040,looked at the manual complicated you
hiLlNzxDfAg,823040,826050,goes no no don't look at that don't look
hiLlNzxDfAg,826050,829110,at that we're done here no shields for
hiLlNzxDfAg,829110,832079,days no I always keep these things just
hiLlNzxDfAg,832079,834089,in case I ever encounter that board
hiLlNzxDfAg,834089,836100,again or like find one that happens to
hiLlNzxDfAg,836100,836690,have exact
hiLlNzxDfAg,836690,839120,the same layout it has never once paid
hiLlNzxDfAg,839120,843410,off oh my goodness cyrix CPUs and you
hiLlNzxDfAg,843410,845990,got a whole shelf why these are worth
hiLlNzxDfAg,845990,847399,more in gold than they are in
hiLlNzxDfAg,847399,850790,functioning processor that's a 133 a 133
hiLlNzxDfAg,850790,853250,I'll let the integrated fan huh but you
hiLlNzxDfAg,853250,854629,could overclock the snot out of that
hiLlNzxDfAg,854629,859069,thing a salon Athlon XP era very nice 1
hiLlNzxDfAg,859069,861259,gigahertz k7 a lot of people don't know
hiLlNzxDfAg,861259,863060,this but AMD was actually the first to
hiLlNzxDfAg,863060,865550,break the 1 gigahertz barrier the more
hiLlNzxDfAg,865550,869089,you know oh socketed laptop chips it's
hiLlNzxDfAg,869089,869720,gonna be like
hiLlNzxDfAg,869720,873500,Danya score like early early core series
hiLlNzxDfAg,873500,875779,I would guess right quark - I think oh
hiLlNzxDfAg,875779,880879,wow a gravis gamepad ok now this had a
hiLlNzxDfAg,880879,883699,really amazing feature for the time you
hiLlNzxDfAg,883699,886939,see this threaded insert right here so
hiLlNzxDfAg,886939,889100,you could actually take this little
hiLlNzxDfAg,889100,892220,Winky joystick and you could screw it
hiLlNzxDfAg,892220,895220,into it and then you could use it like
hiLlNzxDfAg,895220,898129,like like more like an arcade stick and
hiLlNzxDfAg,898129,900410,like a fight pad so a lot of you kids
hiLlNzxDfAg,900410,902300,probably won't know this but before
hiLlNzxDfAg,902300,904689,there was a three and a half inch floppy
hiLlNzxDfAg,904689,907730,there was a five and a quarter inch
hiLlNzxDfAg,907730,912439,floppy yes my friends I forget what the
hiLlNzxDfAg,912439,914779,capacity of these was but one thing is
hiLlNzxDfAg,914779,918019,for sure adventure math fit on at least
hiLlNzxDfAg,918019,923720,two of them risk disc 1 of 2 disc 2 of 2
hiLlNzxDfAg,923720,927439,oh man there was a great risk custom map
hiLlNzxDfAg,927439,929089,for supreme commander that seems to have
hiLlNzxDfAg,929089,931850,been lost to the bowels of the Internet
hiLlNzxDfAg,931850,933920,unfortunately hey if anyone out there is
hiLlNzxDfAg,933920,935149,watching and you still have that old
hiLlNzxDfAg,935149,938000,supreme commander risk map let me know
hiLlNzxDfAg,938000,941209,it was flippin awesome ok so I gotta
hiLlNzxDfAg,941209,942980,know the stories behind at least a
hiLlNzxDfAg,942980,945199,couple of these so this one you were
hiLlNzxDfAg,945199,947660,saying was your very first PC yep that's
hiLlNzxDfAg,947660,950000,the one that started it all oops now
hiLlNzxDfAg,950000,952759,this is a classic right here turbo
hiLlNzxDfAg,952759,954829,button this really did make your
hiLlNzxDfAg,954829,958790,computer go slower when it was activated
hiLlNzxDfAg,958790,961220,common misconception a lot of people
hiLlNzxDfAg,961220,963559,think the turbo button was designed to
hiLlNzxDfAg,963559,966680,make your computer turbo up when it was
hiLlNzxDfAg,966680,968870,enabled but actually it was because
hiLlNzxDfAg,968870,970150,computers were
hiLlNzxDfAg,970150,973180,too fast for games and games used to
hiLlNzxDfAg,973180,975640,have their physics tied to the clock
hiLlNzxDfAg,975640,976660,speed of the CPU
hiLlNzxDfAg,976660,979510,so when CPUs got too fast they needed a
hiLlNzxDfAg,979510,981430,way to enable compatibility for these
hiLlNzxDfAg,981430,984100,old poorly coded games so you would
hiLlNzxDfAg,984100,985779,press the turbo button and it would
hiLlNzxDfAg,985779,988390,actually clock your computer down so my
hiLlNzxDfAg,988390,990250,parents when I wasn't allowed to use the
hiLlNzxDfAg,990250,992589,computer used to lock it and our power
hiLlNzxDfAg,992589,994600,button wouldn't work anymore little did
hiLlNzxDfAg,994600,996310,they know I had a key for it as well but
hiLlNzxDfAg,996310,1000770,I haven't booted this up in years I
hiLlNzxDfAg,1000770,1003990,still need to fix the keyboard on it but
hiLlNzxDfAg,1003990,1006089,it did work the last the compact
hiLlNzxDfAg,1006089,1013380,portable PC yes it is Wow no way so guys
hiLlNzxDfAg,1013380,1016290,the way I could actually tell not
hiLlNzxDfAg,1016290,1019170,because I recognized it immediately was
hiLlNzxDfAg,1019170,1022110,just because I knew that it had a handle
hiLlNzxDfAg,1022110,1023940,on it that looked just like this so
hiLlNzxDfAg,1023940,1025319,there you go the entire back of it at
hiLlNzxDfAg,1025319,1027058,the computer there's your five and a
hiLlNzxDfAg,1027058,1028470,quarter inch floppy drive
hiLlNzxDfAg,1028470,1030420,there's your I don't know what is this
hiLlNzxDfAg,1030420,1033329,like a 7/8 inch I think it's an 8 inch
hiLlNzxDfAg,1033329,1035428,it's green monochrome and you've got a
hiLlNzxDfAg,1035428,1038100,brightness dial yeah and this is
hiLlNzxDfAg,1038100,1039780,actually the Plus model it has a hard
hiLlNzxDfAg,1039780,1044880,disk technically there right it is
hiLlNzxDfAg,1044880,1048780,portable okay so to challenge Brian to
hiLlNzxDfAg,1048780,1051510,prove that there's a use for this
hiLlNzxDfAg,1051510,1055230,collection I said okay find me a game I
hiLlNzxDfAg,1055230,1057510,used to play I want to play me some
hiLlNzxDfAg,1057510,1060210,Commander Keen right now so he pulled
hiLlNzxDfAg,1060210,1063809,down this 486 and this was what
hiLlNzxDfAg,1063809,1067050,particular variant this is a DX 2 2
hiLlNzxDfAg,1067050,1070290,Clarke doubled 66 megahertz I'm
hiLlNzxDfAg,1070290,1073710,surprised to you PG a track without used
hiLlNzxDfAg,1073710,1076860,this crap remember when the speaker was
hiLlNzxDfAg,1076860,1079880,built into the computer
hiLlNzxDfAg,1080650,1090220,oh my - I don't know what the controls
hiLlNzxDfAg,1090220,1092080,are thought of a space that might be
hiLlNzxDfAg,1092080,1099940,control or something oh it's some
hiLlNzxDfAg,1099940,1105280,demented dog what I'm stuck I need the
hiLlNzxDfAg,1105280,1108880,key now our final piece of tech
hiLlNzxDfAg,1108880,1112180,archaeology here is this this is an AMD
hiLlNzxDfAg,1112180,1118179,based laptop yep it's a k-6 - 366 holy
hiLlNzxDfAg,1118179,1124720,crap that display is horrible even with
hiLlNzxDfAg,1124720,1126820,the pointer trails on or even without
hiLlNzxDfAg,1126820,1129250,them you'd basically have point pointer
hiLlNzxDfAg,1129250,1130929,trails are all that's not pointer trails
hiLlNzxDfAg,1130929,1135640,oh my goodness it's horrible
hiLlNzxDfAg,1135640,1138070,are you sure they're not on possible can
hiLlNzxDfAg,1138070,1139630,I double check you can double check
hiLlNzxDfAg,1139630,1141640,before you watch but can I double check
hiLlNzxDfAg,1141640,1144520,oh wow they're off what if we turn them
hiLlNzxDfAg,1144520,1146640,on
hiLlNzxDfAg,1150670,1153920,that's awful how far we've come so
hiLlNzxDfAg,1153920,1155690,imagine this it's after midnight and
hiLlNzxDfAg,1155690,1158480,someone's knocking on your door did you
hiLlNzxDfAg,1158480,1161270,order pizza in your sleep again or is it
hiLlNzxDfAg,1161270,1162590,something a little bit more worrisome
hiLlNzxDfAg,1162590,1164650,well instead of getting out of bed
hiLlNzxDfAg,1164650,1166850,deciding whether it's worth taking the
hiLlNzxDfAg,1166850,1168980,time to put clothes on or not you can
hiLlNzxDfAg,1168980,1171230,check who's there with the ring doorbell

hiLlNzxDfAg,1215540,1217460,for showing us your little tech museum
hiLlNzxDfAg,1217460,1220100,here it started out as tech hoarders and
hiLlNzxDfAg,1220100,1223370,ended up with tech museum hoarders
