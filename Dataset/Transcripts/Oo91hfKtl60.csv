Oo91hfKtl60,770800,776720,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,776720,783279,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,783279,788480,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,788480,793600,the bear saw the finally read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,793600,798959,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,798959,806240,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,806240,812160,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,812160,818880,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,818880,825120,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,825120,831279,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,831279,837279,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,837279,843279,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  ew they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,843279,849120,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,849120,856399,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,856399,862079,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,862079,870240,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed with the
Oo91hfKtl60,870240,876800,farmer hurrying him from behind the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,876800,883040,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,883040,889040,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,889040,895360,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,895360,902480,then the farmer came over and started to  revive the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,902480,910160,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,910160,916320,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,916320,921680,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,921680,928079,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,928079,934160,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,934160,940240,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,940240,947279,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,947279,953680,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,953680,959839,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,959839,965759,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,965759,971680,my bed with this chase the flies away  and if they wake me up i'll throw you
Oo91hfKtl60,971680,978560,out and you will not get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,978560,984399,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,984399,990399,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,990399,995680,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,995680,1002000,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,1002000,1007519,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,1007519,1013360,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,1013360,1019680,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,1019680,1026240,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,1026240,1031918,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,1031918,1038959,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,1038959,1046880,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,1046880,1051919,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,1051919,1059039,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,1059039,1074289,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,1527279,1533919,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,1533919,1539600,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,1539600,1544640,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,1544640,1551039,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,1551039,1558080,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,1558080,1563520,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,1563520,1569360,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,1569360,1574960,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,1574960,1580000,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,1580000,1587039,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it
Oo91hfKtl60,1587039,1593840,she thought very hard and very long and  then she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,1593840,1599039,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,1599039,1604159,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,1604159,1609440,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit so jack put a leash
Oo91hfKtl60,1609440,1615440,on the cow and headed to the market but  the road was long and tiring he was
Oo91hfKtl60,1615440,1622559,halfway to the market when he got tired  and laid down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,1622559,1629200,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,1629200,1635520,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,1635520,1643039,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,1643039,1648559,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,1648559,1654399,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,1654399,1660799,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,1660799,1668480,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,1668480,1673760,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,1673760,1681039,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,1681039,1687360,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,1687360,1693200,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,1693200,1698720,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,1698720,1706000,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,1706000,1712799,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,1712799,1718559,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,1718559,1723679,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,1723679,1729440,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,1729440,1735200,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,1735200,1741679,to climb up the bean tree he fell down  once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,1741679,1748080,should he give it another try why bother  hey you up there
Oo91hfKtl60,1748080,1753440,shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,1753440,1758640,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,1758640,1763919,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,1763919,1769520,to him from above jack looked closely  and saw this rope resemble the girl's
Oo91hfKtl60,1769520,1776240,braid  jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,1776240,1782799,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,1782799,1788159,princess straightened out her crown curt  seed and said i probably have bruises

Oo91hfKtl60,2215410,2220880,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,2220880,2227760,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,2227760,2234240,not going the way it chewed  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,2234240,2241280,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,2241280,2248160,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,2248160,2254000,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,2254000,2260800,waiting for christmas to come  so he citrus rife i'm going fishing dear
Oo91hfKtl60,2260800,2265920,the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,2265920,2271920,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,2271920,2277359,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,2277359,2284720,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,2284720,2291839,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,2291839,2297359,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off it wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,2297359,2304640,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,2304640,2310480,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,2310480,2316000,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost had a
Oo91hfKtl60,2316000,2322800,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,2322800,2330400,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,2330400,2337599,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,2337599,2344800,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,2344800,2352240,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,2352240,2357440,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,2357440,2364000,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,2364000,2370640,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,2370640,2377119,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,2377119,2382800,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,2382800,2388400,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,2388400,2393839,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,2393839,2398880,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,2398880,2405119,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,2405119,2410560,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,2410560,2417760,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,2417760,2423440,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,2423440,2429599,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,2429599,2436640,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,2436640,2442480,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spawning
Oo91hfKtl60,2442480,2449119,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,2449119,2454720,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,2454720,2460160,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,2460160,2467200,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,2467200,2473440,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,2473440,2479440,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,2479440,2487440,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,2487440,2493520,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog that i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,2493520,2500160,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,2500160,2505920,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,2505920,2511040,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,2511040,2519450,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  toasted cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,3308000,3313920,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,3313920,3320480,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,3320480,3325680,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,3325680,3330799,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,3330799,3336160,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,3336160,3343359,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,3343359,3349359,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,3349359,3356079,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,3356079,3363920,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest the farmer scratched the back of
Oo91hfKtl60,3363920,3369359,his head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you  some
Oo91hfKtl60,3369359,3374400,tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,3374400,3380480,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,3380480,3386319,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,3386319,3393599,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,3393599,3399200,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,3399200,3404240,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice
Oo91hfKtl60,3404240,3409280,he worked and huffed and puffed  with the farmer hurrying him from behind
Oo91hfKtl60,3409280,3416480,the plow  come on my little pony run faster  anyway they plowed the fields planted
Oo91hfKtl60,3416480,3422240,the seeds and then boom  they got lots and lots of turnips
Oo91hfKtl60,3422240,3428720,the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house  where he threw them into a heap
Oo91hfKtl60,3428720,3435200,the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand  then the farmer came over and started to
Oo91hfKtl60,3435200,3442400,divide the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and  told the bear these are my roots
Oo91hfKtl60,3442400,3451119,he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right  here are your tops bon appetit bear
Oo91hfKtl60,3451119,3458000,the bear tasted them and said ew this  tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to
Oo91hfKtl60,3458000,3463200,me  a farmer looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked
Oo91hfKtl60,3463200,3469280,for the tops didn't you  the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his
Oo91hfKtl60,3469280,3477440,jaw dropped and you could hear his  stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,3477440,3484400,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,3484400,3490880,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,3490880,3496960,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,3496960,3502960,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,3502960,3509760,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,3509760,3515760,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,3515760,3521520,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,3521520,3527520,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,3527520,3532880,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,3532880,3539119,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,3539119,3544640,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,3544640,3550559,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,3550559,3556799,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,3556799,3563440,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,3563440,3569119,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,3569119,3576160,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,3576160,3584000,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,3584000,3589119,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,3589119,3595280,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no

Oo91hfKtl60,4059359,4064480,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,4064480,4071039,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,4071039,4076799,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,4076799,4081839,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,4081839,4088160,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,4088160,4095280,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,4095280,4100719,were tears in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,4100719,4106560,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,4106560,4112159,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,4112159,4117199,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,4117199,4124400,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,4124400,4131040,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,4131040,4136238,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,4136238,4141359,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,4141359,4147758,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,4147758,4153278,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,4153278,4159758,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,4159758,4166400,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,4166400,4172719,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy lets me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,4172719,4180159,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,4180159,4185758,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,4185758,4191600,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,4191600,4198000,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,4198000,4205600,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,4205600,4210960,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,4210960,4218159,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,4218159,4224560,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,4224560,4230400,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,4230400,4235840,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,4235840,4243120,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,4243120,4250000,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,4250000,4255679,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,4255679,4260800,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,4260800,4266560,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,4266560,4274000,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,4274000,4282800,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,4282800,4290560,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,4290560,4295840,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,4295840,4301120,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,4301120,4308080,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,4308080,4313440,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,4313440,4319760,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid
Oo91hfKtl60,4319760,4324800,the princess straightened out her crown  curt seed and said i probably have
Oo91hfKtl60,4324800,4331600,bruises all over my body because i slept  on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,4331600,4336719,down off the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride
Oo91hfKtl60,4336719,4341920,that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,4341920,4347040,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very
Oo91hfKtl60,4347040,4354400,interesting in my vegetable patch too  just like jack but i have to make sure  no pets get into my beautiful garden
Oo91hfKtl60,4354400,4401679,so i'll say goodbye now i have to go  stand guard  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,4752590,4758080,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,4758080,4764080,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake not so my dear friends if
Oo91hfKtl60,4764080,4769360,decorating is not going the way it  chewed  do you know what can happen
Oo91hfKtl60,4769360,4774480,i'll tell you about it  the wolf and the fox in a village far
Oo91hfKtl60,4774480,4781199,far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the  force nearby lived a very sly wolf who
Oo91hfKtl60,4781199,4787199,was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen  when it was christmas time the men
Oo91hfKtl60,4787199,4794159,decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around  waiting for christmas to come
Oo91hfKtl60,4794159,4800719,so he said to his wife i'm going fishing  dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was
Oo91hfKtl60,4800719,4805920,going fishing  so this very sly fox ran out of force on
Oo91hfKtl60,4805920,4812400,the road and slaying down and pretended  to be absolutely not alive
Oo91hfKtl60,4812400,4819520,when the man saw the fox  he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,4819520,4824800,into the sleigh and together they drove  up the man's favorite spot the fisherman
Oo91hfKtl60,4824800,4831840,sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting  there for a long time and even started
Oo91hfKtl60,4831840,4839280,to doze off it wasn't having any luck  catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and
Oo91hfKtl60,4839280,4845840,she sat up and started to watch from the  sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed
Oo91hfKtl60,4845840,4853120,behind the fox's back  what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,4853120,4860000,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,4860000,4867600,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,4867600,4874800,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,4874800,4882000,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,4882000,4889440,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,4889440,4894560,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,4894560,4901199,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,4901199,4907840,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,4907840,4914320,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,4914320,4919920,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,4919920,4927440,into it  and then sang the christmas tree grew in  the pony grew all told and green
Oo91hfKtl60,4927440,4933600,the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water  just like the humans they even had a
Oo91hfKtl60,4933600,4939920,cake but what they didn't have was a  christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow
Oo91hfKtl60,4939920,4947760,bigger in the water and started to look  like a christmas tree only was great and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,4947760,4954960,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,4954960,4960639,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,4960639,4966800,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,4966800,4973760,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,4973760,4979679,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,4979679,4986320,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,4986320,4991920,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,4991920,4997280,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,4997280,5004400,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,5004400,5010639,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,5010639,5015840,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen you see we're stuck we need
Oo91hfKtl60,5015840,5020880,help the fishermen grabbed the fox the  fox grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed
Oo91hfKtl60,5020880,5026719,his tail but they couldn't pull it out  the fisherman called his wife his wife
Oo91hfKtl60,5026719,5032639,called the dog then i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse  all together they pulled and pulled with
Oo91hfKtl60,5032639,5039360,all their might and the tail came out of  the water  of course there were no fish on the
Oo91hfKtl60,5039360,5046320,trail just a bunch of christmas  decorations  and that moment the fireworks started
Oo91hfKtl60,5046320,5053199,that's what i'm telling you during the  holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than

Oo91hfKtl60,5848000,5853040,talking about me here so i'd better tell  you a fairy tale
Oo91hfKtl60,5853040,5860080,there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was  the forest with all sorts of creatures
Oo91hfKtl60,5860080,5868000,living in it including the bear one day  the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,5868000,5873360,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,5873360,5880560,out what was going on but he pushed the  farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,5880560,5886560,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,5886560,5893280,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,5893280,5899520,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,5899520,5905679,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,5905679,5911679,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops of the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,5911679,5917679,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,5917679,5923520,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,5923520,5930800,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,5930800,5936480,the pow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,5936480,5944239,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,5944239,5951199,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,5951199,5957360,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,5957360,5963440,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,5963440,5969760,where he threw them into a heap the poor  bear was so tired he could barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,5969760,5976880,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,5976880,5984480,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,5984480,5990719,here are your tops bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,5990719,5996080,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,5996080,6002480,a farmer looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,6002480,6008560,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,6008560,6014639,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,6014639,6021600,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,6021600,6028080,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,6028080,6034159,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,6034159,6040159,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,6040159,6046960,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,6046960,6052960,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,6052960,6058719,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,6058719,6064719,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,6064719,6070080,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,6070080,6076400,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,6076400,6081840,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,6081840,6087760,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,6087760,6094080,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,6094080,6100639,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,6100639,6106320,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,6106320,6113360,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,6113360,6121280,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,6121280,6126320,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,6126320,6132480,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,6132480,6148670,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,6596560,6601679,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i am protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,6601679,6608320,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,6608320,6614000,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,6614000,6619040,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,6619040,6625360,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,6625360,6632480,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,6632480,6639520,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack  down it's no wonder they refused to
Oo91hfKtl60,6639520,6646639,marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that  his pants were torn and had patches his
Oo91hfKtl60,6646639,6652400,shoes had holes into the soles and his  hat was as flat as a pancake no one
Oo91hfKtl60,6652400,6657440,would marry him no one would even go out  with poor jack the widow knew he needed
Oo91hfKtl60,6657440,6662480,nicer clothes but there was no money so  she thought about it she thought very
Oo91hfKtl60,6662480,6668239,hard and very long and then she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,6668239,6673440,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,6673440,6678560,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,6678560,6685040,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,6685040,6692080,headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was  halfway to the market when he got tired
Oo91hfKtl60,6692080,6699599,and lay down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt  something poking at his side
Oo91hfKtl60,6699599,6706000,he opened his eyes and saw an old mane  jack was very surprised and the old man
Oo91hfKtl60,6706000,6712239,told him  my boy lets me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your car will
Oo91hfKtl60,6712239,6717360,give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,6717360,6722960,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,6722960,6728800,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,6728800,6735199,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,6735199,6742800,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,6742800,6748159,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,6748159,6755360,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,6755360,6761760,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,6761760,6767599,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,6767599,6773119,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,6773119,6780320,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,6780320,6787199,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,6787199,6792960,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,6792960,6798000,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,6798000,6803760,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,6803760,6811199,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,6811199,6820000,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,6820000,6827760,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,6827760,6833040,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,6833040,6838320,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down

Oo91hfKtl60,7289790,7295280,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,7295280,7302159,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,7302159,7308639,not going the way it shoot  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,7308639,7315199,the wolf and the fox  in a village far far away there was a  man a local fisherman and his wife and
Oo91hfKtl60,7315199,7322560,then in the force nearby lived a very  sly wolf who was always sneaking over  and stealing fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,7322560,7328400,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,7328400,7333760,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,7333760,7340320,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,7340320,7346320,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,7346320,7351760,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,7351760,7359119,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,7359119,7366239,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,7366239,7371679,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,7371679,7378880,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from
Oo91hfKtl60,7378880,7384880,this sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,7384880,7390320,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,7390320,7397199,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,7397199,7404800,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,7404800,7412000,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,7412000,7419199,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,7419199,7426639,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,7426639,7431840,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,7431840,7437920,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox but i don't know how to fish
Oo91hfKtl60,7437920,7445040,said the wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,7445040,7451520,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,7451520,7457119,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,7457119,7462800,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,7462800,7468239,all told lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,7468239,7473280,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,7473280,7479520,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,7479520,7484960,like a christmas tree only was grey and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,7484960,7492159,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,7492159,7497840,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,7497840,7504000,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,7504000,7510960,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,7510960,7516880,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,7516880,7523520,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,7523520,7529119,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,7529119,7534480,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,7534480,7541599,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,7541599,7547840,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,7547840,7553840,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,7553840,7560840,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it
Oo91hfKtl60,7560840,7567840,out the fisherman called his wife his  wife called the dog then i'll call the  cat the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,7567840,7574560,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,7574560,7580320,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,7580320,7585360,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,8377760,8385359,right way  i like to do my share of oh sharing  i know sharing is caring but we're not
Oo91hfKtl60,8385359,8392479,talking about me here so i'd better tell  you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village
Oo91hfKtl60,8392479,8400160,the tops and the roots and nearby was  the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,8400160,8405359,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,8405359,8410720,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,8410720,8417920,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,8417920,8423920,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,8423920,8430640,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,8430640,8436880,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,8436880,8443040,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,8443040,8448960,some tell me what part of the plants you  will take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,8448960,8455040,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,8455040,8460880,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,8460880,8467200,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal
Oo91hfKtl60,8467200,8473760,so here's the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,8473760,8481520,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,8481520,8488560,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,8488560,8493920,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,8493920,8500800,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,8500800,8507040,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,8507040,8514160,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,8514160,8521840,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,8521840,8528000,here are your tops  bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,8528000,8533359,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,8533359,8539760,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,8539760,8545920,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,8545920,8551920,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,8551920,8558960,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,8558960,8565439,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant ten roast bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,8565439,8571520,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,8571520,8577520,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,8577520,8582640,my bed with this  two supplies away and if they wake me up
Oo91hfKtl60,8582640,8590240,i'll throw you out and you will not get  any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,8590240,8596080,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,8596080,8602080,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,8602080,8607439,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,8607439,8613680,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,8613680,8619200,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,8619200,8625120,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,8625120,8631359,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,8631359,8638000,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,8638000,8643680,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,8643680,8650720,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,8650720,8658560,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,8658560,8663680,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,8663680,8670800,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,8670800,8686009,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,9133920,9138960,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,9138960,9145600,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,9145600,9151280,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,9151280,9156399,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,9156399,9162720,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,9162720,9169760,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,9169760,9175280,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,9175280,9181120,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,9181120,9186720,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,9186720,9191760,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,9191760,9198960,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,9198960,9205600,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,9205600,9210800,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,9210800,9215840,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,9215840,9222319,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,9222319,9227840,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,9227840,9234319,market when he got tired and lay down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,9234319,9240880,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,9240880,9247280,jack was very surprised  and the old man told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,9247280,9254720,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,9254720,9260319,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,9260319,9266160,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,9266160,9272560,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,9272560,9280160,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,9280160,9285520,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,9285520,9292720,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,9292720,9299120,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,9299120,9304960,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,9304960,9310399,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,9310399,9317680,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,9317680,9324560,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,9324560,9330240,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,9330240,9335359,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,9335359,9341120,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,9341120,9346960,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,9346960,9353359,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,9353359,9358560,should he give it another try why bother  hey you
Oo91hfKtl60,9358560,9365120,up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,9365120,9370319,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,9370319,9375680,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,9375680,9382640,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,9382640,9387680,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  goodie yank and a beautiful princess
Oo91hfKtl60,9387680,9394319,fell down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid
Oo91hfKtl60,9394319,9401920,the princess straightened out her crown  curt seed and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,9401920,9409280,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i'm
Oo91hfKtl60,9409280,9416399,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,9819780,9824329,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,9827130,9832640,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,9832640,9839520,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,9839520,9846000,not going the way it should do you know  what can happen i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,9846000,9852560,the wolf and the fox  in a village far far away there was a  man a local fisherman and his wife and
Oo91hfKtl60,9852560,9859840,then in the fourth nearby lived a very  sly wolf who was always sneaking over  and stealing fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,9859840,9865680,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,9865680,9871120,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,9871120,9877600,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,9877600,9883600,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,9883600,9889120,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,9889120,9896479,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,9896479,9903920,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,9903920,9909439,there for a long time and even started  to doze off he wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,9909439,9916319,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,9916319,9923040,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,9923040,9930080,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  fret and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,9930080,9936800,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,9936800,9942160,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,9942160,9949359,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,9949359,9956560,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,9956560,9964000,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,9964000,9969120,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,9969120,9975760,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,9975760,9982399,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,9982399,9988800,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,9988800,9994479,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,9994479,10000080,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,10000080,10005520,all told and green the fish were  celebrating christmas in the water
Oo91hfKtl60,10005520,10010640,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,10010640,10016880,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,10016880,10022240,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,10022240,10029520,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,10029520,10035120,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,10035120,10041279,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,10041279,10048319,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,10048319,10054240,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,10054240,10060880,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,10060880,10066399,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,10066399,10071840,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,10071840,10078960,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,10078960,10085120,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,10085120,10091200,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,10091200,10099120,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,10099120,10105200,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog the dog called the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,10105200,10111840,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,10111840,10117600,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,10117600,10122720,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,10122720,10131170,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  toasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,10919680,10925680,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,10925680,10932240,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,10932240,10937439,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,10937439,10942560,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,10942560,10947920,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,10947920,10955120,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,10955120,10961120,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,10961120,10967840,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,10967840,10974080,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,10974080,10980240,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,10980240,10986160,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,10986160,10993200,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  ew they're so dirty so the bear told the
Oo91hfKtl60,10993200,10999840,farmer of course i will take the tops  fine said the farmer  we have a deal
Oo91hfKtl60,10999840,11006479,i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal  so here's the plow
Oo91hfKtl60,11006479,11012720,let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected  that he'd be asked to plow the field
Oo91hfKtl60,11012720,11018800,like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,11018800,11025760,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,11025760,11031120,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,11031120,11038000,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,11038000,11044240,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,11044240,11051439,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,11051439,11059040,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,11059040,11065279,here are your tops bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,11065279,11070560,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,11070560,11077040,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,11077040,11083120,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,11083120,11089120,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,11089120,11096160,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,11096160,11102640,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,11102640,11108720,bads of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,11108720,11114720,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,11114720,11120640,my bed with this  choose the flies away  and if they wake me up i'll throw you
Oo91hfKtl60,11120640,11127520,out and you will not get any turnips  the poor bear sighed put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,11127520,11133279,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,11133279,11139279,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,11139279,11144840,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,11144840,11150880,turnips  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,11150880,11156399,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,11156399,11162319,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,11162319,11168560,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,11168560,11175200,he will wake up  so he raised the fly's watcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,11175200,11180880,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,11180880,11187920,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,11187920,11195840,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,11195840,11200880,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,11200880,11207040,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,11207040,11224880,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,11676239,11682800,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,11682800,11688560,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,11688560,11693600,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,11693600,11699920,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,11699920,11707040,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,11707040,11712479,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,11712479,11718319,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,11718319,11723920,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,11723920,11728960,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,11728960,11736160,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,11736160,11742800,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,11742800,11748000,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,11748000,11753120,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,11753120,11759520,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,11759520,11765040,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,11765040,11771520,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,11771520,11778160,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old  mane
Oo91hfKtl60,11778160,11784479,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,11784479,11791920,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,11791920,11797520,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,11797520,11803359,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,11803359,11809760,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,11809760,11817359,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,11817359,11822720,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,11822720,11829920,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,11829920,11836319,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,11836319,11842160,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,11842160,11847600,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,11847600,11854880,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,11854880,11861760,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,11861760,11867439,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,11867439,11872560,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,11872560,11878319,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,11878319,11885760,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,11885760,11894560,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,11894560,11902319,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,11902319,11907600,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,11907600,11912880,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,11912880,11919840,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,11919840,11925120,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,11925120,11931680,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,11931680,11937120,princess straightened out her crown curt  seed and said i probably have bruises
Oo91hfKtl60,11937120,11943279,all over my body because i slept on all  those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,11943279,11948479,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride

Oo91hfKtl60,12357770,12361549,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,12364350,12369840,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,12369840,12376720,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,12376720,12383200,not going the way it dude  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,12383200,12390239,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,12390239,12397120,fourth nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,12397120,12402960,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,12402960,12408319,waiting for christmas to  come so he citrus rife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,12408319,12414800,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,12414800,12420880,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,12420880,12426319,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,12426319,12433680,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,12433680,12440800,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,12440800,12446239,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,12446239,12453520,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,12453520,12459439,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,12459439,12465359,what do you think you're doing this  startled the fox who almost died of fret
Oo91hfKtl60,12465359,12471680,and grabbed her chest but it was only  the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,12471680,12479359,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,12479359,12486560,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,12486560,12493760,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,12493760,12501200,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,12501200,12506319,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,12506319,12512960,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,12512960,12519600,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,12519600,12526080,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,12526080,12531680,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,12531680,12539200,into it  and then saying the christmas tree grew  in the pony grew all told and green
Oo91hfKtl60,12539200,12545279,the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water  just like the humans they even had a
Oo91hfKtl60,12545279,12551680,cake but what they didn't have was a  christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow
Oo91hfKtl60,12551680,12559520,bigger in the water and started to look  like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,12559520,12566720,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,12566720,12572840,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,12572840,12577920,celebrate and the fish became happy too  and started dancing around their
Oo91hfKtl60,12577920,12584880,decorated christmas tale it's time to  take the catch out the wolf decided to  pull his tail out he pulled once nothing
Oo91hfKtl60,12584880,12591439,happened he pulled again but the tail  wouldn't butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,12591439,12598080,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,12598080,12603680,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,12603680,12609040,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,12609040,12616160,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,12616160,12622399,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,12622399,12628399,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,12628399,12636399,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,12636399,12642399,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog that i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,12642399,12649040,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,12649120,12654800,of course there were no fish on the  trail just a bunch of christmas  decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,12654800,12659920,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,13474640,13479760,the bear saw the farmer read his car  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,13479760,13485120,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,13485120,13492319,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,13492319,13498319,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,13498319,13505040,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked

Oo91hfKtl60,13511279,13517439,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you

Oo91hfKtl60,13549920,13556000,like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,13556000,13562960,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,13562960,13569120,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,13569120,13575199,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,13575199,13581439,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,13581439,13588640,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,13588640,13596239,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,13596239,13602479,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,13602479,13607840,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,13607840,13614239,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,13614239,13620319,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,13620319,13626399,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,13626399,13633359,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,13633359,13639840,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,13639840,13645920,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,13645920,13651920,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by

Oo91hfKtl60,13658720,13664720,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,13664720,13670479,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,13670479,13676479,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,13676479,13681840,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,13681840,13688080,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,13688080,13693600,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,13693600,13699520,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,13699520,13705760,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,13705760,13712399,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,13712399,13718080,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,13718080,13725120,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,13725120,13733040,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,13733040,13738080,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,13738080,13744239,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,13744239,13757770,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,14208319,14214560,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now  i'm protecting the vegetable garden from
Oo91hfKtl60,14214560,14220080,all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,14220080,14225760,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,14225760,14230800,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,14230800,14237120,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,14237120,14244239,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,14244239,14249680,were tears in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,14249680,14255520,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,14255520,14261120,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,14261120,14266160,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,14266160,14273359,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,14273359,14280000,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,14280000,14285199,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,14285199,14290319,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,14290319,14296800,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,14296800,14302239,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,14302239,14308720,market when he got tired and lay down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,14308720,14315359,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,14315359,14321680,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,14321680,14329120,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,14329120,14334720,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,14334720,14340560,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,14340560,14346960,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,14346960,14354560,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,14354560,14359920,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,14359920,14367120,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,14367120,14373520,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,14373520,14379359,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,14379359,14384880,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,14384880,14392080,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,14392080,14398960,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,14398960,14404720,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,14404720,14409760,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,14409760,14415520,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,14415520,14422960,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,14422960,14431760,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,14431760,14439520,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,14439520,14444800,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,14444800,14450080,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,14450080,14457040,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,14457040,14462399,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,14462399,14468720,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid
Oo91hfKtl60,14468720,14473760,the princess straightened out her crown  curt seed and said i probably have
Oo91hfKtl60,14473760,14479359,bruises all over my body because i slept  on all those beans thank you my good
Oo91hfKtl60,14479359,14484479,friend for bringing me down of the tree  i am so grateful i am ready to be your

Oo91hfKtl60,14901550,14907040,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,14907040,14913920,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,14913920,14920399,not going the way it dude  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,14920399,14927439,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,14927439,14934319,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,14934319,14940159,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,14940159,14945520,waiting for christmas to come  so he said just right i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,14945520,14952080,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,14952080,14958080,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,14958080,14963520,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,14963520,14970880,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,14970880,14978000,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,14978000,14983439,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off it wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,14983439,14990800,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,14990800,14996640,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,14996640,15002080,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,15002080,15008960,french and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,15008960,15016560,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,15016560,15023680,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,15023680,15030960,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,15030960,15038399,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,15038399,15043600,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,15043600,15050840,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the

Oo91hfKtl60,15074560,15082159,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water just like the humans they even
Oo91hfKtl60,15082159,15088880,had a cake but what they didn't have was  a christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow
Oo91hfKtl60,15088880,15096720,bigger in the water and started to look  like a christmas tree only was grey and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,15096720,15103920,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so

Oo91hfKtl60,15143199,15148560,fox heard the wolf screaming and thought  did he really catch the fish now he will
Oo91hfKtl60,15148560,15155279,eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and  ran to the wolf

Oo91hfKtl60,15994159,16000080,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,16000080,16006640,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,16006640,16011840,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,16011840,16016960,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,16016960,16022319,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,16022319,16029600,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,16029600,16035520,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,16035520,16042239,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,16042239,16048479,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,16048479,16054640,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,16054640,16060640,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,16060640,16066640,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh  they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,16066640,16072479,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,16072479,16079760,we have a deal i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,16079760,16085439,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,16085439,16093199,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,16093199,16100159,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,16100159,16106479,anyway they found the fields planted the  seeds and then boom they got lots and
Oo91hfKtl60,16106479,16112399,lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,16112399,16118720,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,16118720,16125840,then the farmer came over and started to  revive the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,16125840,16133520,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,16133520,16139680,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,16139680,16145040,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,16145040,16151439,a farmer looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,16151439,16157520,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,16157520,16163600,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,16163600,16170640,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,16170640,16177040,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,16177040,16183199,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,16183199,16189120,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,16189120,16196000,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,16196000,16201920,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,16201920,16207760,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,16207760,16213760,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,16213760,16219040,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,16219040,16225359,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,16225359,16230880,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,16230880,16236720,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,16236720,16243040,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,16243040,16249600,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,16249600,16255279,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose a
Oo91hfKtl60,16255279,16262319,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,16262319,16270239,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,16270239,16275279,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,16275279,16282399,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,16282399,16294989,of their nose be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,16739539,16744799,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,16745520,16750639,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,16750639,16757279,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,16757279,16762959,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,16762959,16768000,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,16768000,16774400,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,16774400,16781440,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,16781440,16786878,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,16786878,16792718,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,16792718,16798320,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,16798320,16803360,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,16803360,16810400,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it
Oo91hfKtl60,16810400,16817200,she thought very hard and very long and  then she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,16817200,16822400,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,16822400,16827520,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,16827520,16834000,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,16834000,16841040,headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was  halfway to the market when he got tired
Oo91hfKtl60,16841040,16848560,and lay down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt  something poking at his side
Oo91hfKtl60,16848560,16855040,he opened his eyes and saw an old mane  jack was very surprised and the old man
Oo91hfKtl60,16855040,16861200,told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your cat will
Oo91hfKtl60,16861200,16866400,give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,16866400,16872240,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell a spot a cow so
Oo91hfKtl60,16872240,16877760,without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,16877760,16884160,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,16884160,16891760,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,16891760,16897120,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,16897120,16904400,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,16904400,16910718,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,16910718,16916560,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,16916560,16922080,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,16922080,16929360,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,16929360,16936160,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,16936160,16942560,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,16942560,16947920,tree was so big and tall that its top  reached all the way to the clouds high
Oo91hfKtl60,16947920,16955600,up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds  he was curious to know who could be up
Oo91hfKtl60,16955600,16961440,there singing the song so jack started  to climb up the bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,16961440,16968958,he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,16968958,16976798,hey you up there  shadow jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,16976798,16982000,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,16982000,16987280,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,16987280,16994240,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,16994240,16999600,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,16999600,17006160,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,17006160,17013520,princess straightened out her crown  curtseyed and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,17013520,17020878,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,17020878,17028080,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,17432200,17435968,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,17438770,17444240,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,17444240,17451120,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,17451120,17457600,not going the way it dude  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,17457600,17464638,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,17464638,17471520,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,17471520,17477360,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,17477360,17484160,waiting for christmas to come  so he citrus rife i'm going fishing dear
Oo91hfKtl60,17484160,17489280,the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,17489280,17495280,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,17495280,17500718,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,17500718,17508080,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,17508080,17515200,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,17515200,17520718,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,17520718,17528000,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,17528000,17533840,sleigh on the sly suddenly someone came  up and screamed behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,17533840,17539360,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost had a
Oo91hfKtl60,17539360,17546160,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,17546160,17553760,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,17553760,17560958,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,17560958,17568160,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,17568160,17575600,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,17575600,17580798,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,17580798,17587360,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,17587360,17594000,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,17594000,17600480,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,17600480,17606160,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,17606160,17611760,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,17611760,17617200,all told  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,17617200,17622240,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,17622240,17628480,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,17628480,17633600,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling
Oo91hfKtl60,17633600,17638798,so the fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something
Oo91hfKtl60,17638798,17643840,sticking to his tail under the water so  he became happy and sang even louder we
Oo91hfKtl60,17643840,17650718,decorate the christmas tree and start to  celebrate  and the fish became happy too and
Oo91hfKtl60,17650718,17657440,started dancing around their decorated  christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his
Oo91hfKtl60,17657440,17662798,tail out he pulled once nothing happened  he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch
Oo91hfKtl60,17662798,17670400,that's when the wolf started spanning  someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull
Oo91hfKtl60,17670400,17678080,it out you know what really happened to  the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,17678080,17683520,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,17683520,17690560,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,17690560,17696798,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,17696798,17702798,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,17702798,17710798,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,17710798,17716878,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog then i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,17716878,17723520,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,17723520,17729280,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,17729280,17734400,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,17734400,17742810,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  tasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,18531600,18537520,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,18537520,18544080,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,18544080,18549280,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,18549280,18554400,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,18554400,18561520,jumped down and started digging  something up with a shovel the bear  wanted to find out what was going on but
Oo91hfKtl60,18561520,18566958,he pushed the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,18566958,18572958,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,18572958,18579680,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,18579680,18585920,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,18585920,18592080,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,18592080,18598000,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,18598000,18604080,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,18604080,18609920,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,18609920,18616240,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal
Oo91hfKtl60,18616240,18622798,so here's the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,18622798,18630638,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,18630638,18637600,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,18637600,18642958,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,18642958,18650240,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house where he
Oo91hfKtl60,18650240,18656080,threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,18656080,18663280,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,18663280,18670878,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,18670878,18677120,here are your tops bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,18677120,18682400,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,18682400,18688878,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,18688878,18694958,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,18694958,18700958,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,18700958,18708000,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,18708000,18714480,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,18714480,18720560,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,18720560,18726560,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,18726560,18733360,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,18733360,18739360,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,18739360,18745120,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,18745120,18751120,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,18751120,18756480,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,18756480,18762718,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,18762718,18768240,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,18768240,18774160,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,18774160,18780400,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,18780400,18787040,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,18787040,18792718,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,18792718,18799760,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,18799760,18807600,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,18807600,18812718,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,18812718,18818878,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,18818878,18832400,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,19282958,19288080,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,19288080,19294638,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,19294638,19300320,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,19300320,19305440,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,19305440,19311760,spent all day long digging in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,19311760,19318878,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,19318878,19324320,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,19324320,19330160,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,19330160,19335680,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,19335680,19340798,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,19340798,19348000,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,19348000,19354638,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,19354638,19359840,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,19359840,19364958,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,19364958,19371360,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,19371360,19376878,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,19376878,19383360,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,19383360,19390000,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,19390000,19396320,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,19396320,19403760,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,19403760,19409360,want to walk for miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell a spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,19409360,19415200,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,19415200,19421600,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,19421600,19429200,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,19429200,19434558,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,19434558,19441760,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,19441760,19448320,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green the
Oo91hfKtl60,19448320,19454320,widow just threw her hands in the air  and said oh what a simpleton you are my
Oo91hfKtl60,19454320,19459440,son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,19459440,19466718,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,19466718,19473600,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,19473600,19479280,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,19479280,19484400,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,19484400,19492240,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds he was curious to know who
Oo91hfKtl60,19492240,19498878,could be up there singing the song so  jack started to climb up the bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,19498878,19506400,he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,19506400,19514160,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,19514160,19519440,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,19519440,19524718,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,19524718,19531680,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,19531680,19536718,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  goodie yank and a beautiful princess
Oo91hfKtl60,19536718,19543520,fell down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,19543520,19548958,princess straightened out her crown curt  seed and said i probably have bruises
Oo91hfKtl60,19548958,19555200,all over my body because i slept on all  those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,19555200,19560958,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride that's how it
Oo91hfKtl60,19560958,19566958,came to be that jack got married became  a king and got half a kingdom too
Oo91hfKtl60,19566958,19572638,that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very  interesting in my vegetable patch too
Oo91hfKtl60,19572638,19578000,just like jack but i have to make sure  no pets get into my beautiful garden
Oo91hfKtl60,19578000,19585990,so i'll say goodbye now i have to go  stand guard  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,19976180,19982798,[Music]  miracles some people think that  decorating a christmas tree for the
Oo91hfKtl60,19982798,19988558,holidays is a piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,19988558,19995040,not going the way it should  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,19995040,20002080,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,20002080,20008958,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,20008958,20014798,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,20014798,20020160,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,20020160,20026638,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,20026638,20032718,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,20032718,20038160,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,20038160,20045520,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,20045520,20052958,up the man's favorite spot the fishermen  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,20052958,20058480,there for a long time and even started  to doze off he wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,20058480,20065360,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,20065360,20071280,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,20071280,20076718,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,20076718,20083520,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,20083520,20091200,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,20091200,20098400,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,20098400,20105600,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,20105600,20113040,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,20113040,20118160,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,20118160,20124798,then catch fish for yourself  whispered the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,20124798,20131440,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,20131440,20137920,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,20137920,20143520,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,20143520,20151040,into it  and then sang the christmas tree grew in  the pawnee grew up told lundgren
Oo91hfKtl60,20151040,20157120,the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water  just like the humans they even had a
Oo91hfKtl60,20157120,20163520,cake but what they didn't have was a  christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow
Oo91hfKtl60,20163520,20171280,bigger in the water and started to look  like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,20171280,20178558,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,20178558,20184160,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,20184160,20190400,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,20190400,20197360,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,20197360,20203280,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,20203280,20209920,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,20209920,20215520,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,20215520,20220878,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,20220878,20228000,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,20228000,20234160,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,20234160,20240240,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,20240240,20248240,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,20248240,20254240,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog the dog called the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,20254240,20260958,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,20260958,20266638,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,20266638,20271760,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,21068798,21074718,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,21074718,21081280,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,21081280,21086480,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,21086480,21091600,the bear saw the final red his car over  to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,21091600,21096958,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,21096958,21104240,out what was going on but he pushed the  farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,21104240,21110160,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,21110160,21116878,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,21116878,21123120,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,21123120,21129280,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,21129280,21135280,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,21135280,21141280,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,21141280,21147120,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,21147120,21154400,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,21154400,21160080,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,21160080,21167840,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,21167840,21174798,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,21174798,21180958,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,21180958,21187040,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,21187040,21193280,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,21193280,21198958,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop he took all the
Oo91hfKtl60,21198958,21205280,turnips for himself and told the bear  these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that
Oo91hfKtl60,21205280,21212080,were not tasty at all and said all right  here are your tops bun up a tea bear the
Oo91hfKtl60,21212080,21219680,bear tasted them and said ew this tastes  horrible these tops are not edible  farmer why did you give them to me
Oo91hfKtl60,21219680,21226878,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you the bear looked
Oo91hfKtl60,21226878,21233360,back at the farmer speechless he just  stood there with his jaw dropped and you  could hear his stomach making hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,21233360,21240240,noises  the poor bear he was really hungry  so he walked up to the farmer and asked
Oo91hfKtl60,21240240,21248000,can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll  give you some turnips but first you have
Oo91hfKtl60,21248000,21254480,to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big  bads of beans wash all the dirty dishes
Oo91hfKtl60,21254480,21261120,clean the whole house do all the laundry  and  what else oh yeah
Oo91hfKtl60,21261120,21268878,i will go to sleep and you will stand by  my bed with this  two supplies away and if they wake me up
Oo91hfKtl60,21268878,21276558,i'll throw you out and you will not get  any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,21276558,21282400,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,21282400,21288320,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,21288320,21293680,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,21293680,21300000,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,21300000,21305440,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,21305440,21311360,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,21311360,21317680,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,21317680,21324798,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might the bear was
Oo91hfKtl60,21324798,21330400,trying to hit the fly but he hit the  farmer right on the nose the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,21330400,21336958,jumped up holding his nose and screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely

Oo91hfKtl60,21814160,21819420,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,21820160,21825280,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i am protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,21825280,21831920,vegetable garden from all the pests okay  never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,21831920,21837600,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,21837600,21842638,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,21842638,21848958,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,21848958,21856080,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as they
Oo91hfKtl60,21856080,21861520,were tears in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,21861520,21867360,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,21867360,21872958,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,21872958,21878000,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,21878000,21885280,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,21885280,21891840,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,21891840,21897040,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,21897040,21902160,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,21902160,21908638,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,21908638,21915680,headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was  halfway to the market when he got tired
Oo91hfKtl60,21915680,21923200,and laid down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt  something poking at his side
Oo91hfKtl60,21923200,21929600,he opened his eyes and saw an old man  jack was very surprised and the old man
Oo91hfKtl60,21929600,21935840,told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your cow will
Oo91hfKtl60,21935840,21940958,give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,21940958,21946558,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,21946558,21952400,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,21952400,21958798,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,21958798,21966400,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,21966400,21971760,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,21971760,21978958,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,21978958,21985360,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,21985360,21991200,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,21991200,21996718,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,21996718,22003920,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,22003920,22010798,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,22010798,22016558,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,22016558,22021600,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,22021600,22027360,clouds high up in the sky jack could  hear a song coming down from the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,22027360,22034798,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,22034798,22043600,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,22043600,22051360,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,22051360,22056638,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,22056638,22061920,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,22061920,22068878,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,22068878,22074240,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,22074240,22080718,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,22080718,22086160,princess straightened out her crown curt  seed and said i probably have bruises
Oo91hfKtl60,22086160,22092400,all over my body because i slept on all  those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,22092400,22097520,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride
Oo91hfKtl60,22097520,22102718,that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,22102718,22107840,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very

Oo91hfKtl60,22506830,22510600,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,22513400,22518878,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,22518878,22525760,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,22525760,22532240,not going the way it should do you know  what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,22532240,22539280,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,22539280,22546160,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,22546160,22552000,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,22552000,22558798,waiting for christmas to come  so he citrus rife i'm going fishing dear
Oo91hfKtl60,22558798,22563920,the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,22563920,22569920,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,22569920,22575360,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,22575360,22582718,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,22582718,22589840,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,22589840,22595280,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,22595280,22602638,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,22602638,22608480,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,22608480,22613920,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,22613920,22620798,french and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,22620798,22628400,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,22628400,22635600,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,22635600,22642798,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,22642798,22650240,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,22650240,22655440,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,22655440,22662000,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,22662000,22668638,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,22668638,22675120,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,22675120,22680718,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,22680718,22686400,into it and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,22686400,22691840,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,22691840,22696878,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,22696878,22703120,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,22703120,22708558,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,22708558,22715760,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,22715760,22721440,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,22721440,22727600,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,22727600,22734558,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,22734558,22740478,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,22740478,22747120,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,22747120,22752718,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,22752718,22758080,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,22758080,22765200,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,22765200,22771440,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,22771440,22777440,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,22777440,22782638,fishermen grab the fox the fox grabbed  the wolf the wolf grabbed his tail but
Oo91hfKtl60,22782638,22789600,they couldn't pull it out  the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog they'd all call the cat
Oo91hfKtl60,22789600,22795600,the cat called the mouse  all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of
Oo91hfKtl60,22795600,22800718,the water  of course there were no fish on the trip
Oo91hfKtl60,22800718,22807120,just a bunch of christmas decorations  and that moment the fireworks started
Oo91hfKtl60,22807120,22814000,that's what i'm telling you during the  holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than

Oo91hfKtl60,23607440,23613920,is caring but we're not talking about me  here so i'd better tell you a fairy tale
Oo91hfKtl60,23613920,23620958,there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was  the forest with all sorts of creatures
Oo91hfKtl60,23620958,23628958,living in it including the bear one day  the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,23628958,23634240,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,23634240,23641520,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,23641520,23647440,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,23647440,23654160,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,23654160,23660478,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,23660478,23666638,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,23666638,23672558,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,23672558,23678558,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh  they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,23678558,23684400,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,23684400,23691680,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,23691680,23697360,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,23697360,23705120,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,23705120,23712080,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,23712080,23718320,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,23718320,23724320,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,23724320,23730638,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,23730638,23737760,then the farmer came over  and started to revive the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,23737760,23745440,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,23745440,23751600,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,23751600,23756958,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,23756958,23763360,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised  but you asked for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,23763360,23769440,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,23769440,23775520,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,23775520,23782558,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,23782558,23788958,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,23788958,23795120,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,23795120,23801040,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,23801040,23807680,my bed with this  cheese the flies away and if they wake  me up i'll throw you out and you will
Oo91hfKtl60,23807680,23813840,not get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,23813840,23819680,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,23819680,23825680,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,23825680,23830958,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,23830958,23837280,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,23837280,23842798,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,23842798,23848638,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,23848638,23854958,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,23854958,23861520,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,23861520,23867280,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,23867280,23874240,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,23874240,23882160,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,23882160,23887200,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,23887200,23894320,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,23894320,23909580,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,24357520,24362558,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,24362558,24369200,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,24369200,24374878,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,24374878,24379920,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,24379920,24386320,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,24386320,24393360,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,24393360,24398798,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,24398798,24404638,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,24404638,24410240,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,24410240,24415280,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,24415280,24422320,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it
Oo91hfKtl60,24422320,24429120,she thought very hard and very long and  then she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,24429120,24434400,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,24434400,24439440,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,24439440,24444718,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit so jack put a leash
Oo91hfKtl60,24444718,24450718,on the cow and headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was
Oo91hfKtl60,24450718,24457840,halfway to the market when he got tired  and laid down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,24457840,24464478,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,24464478,24470798,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,24470798,24475840,yours and in exchange for your cat will  give you a nice little bean
Oo91hfKtl60,24475840,24480958,to tell you the truth jack really didn't  want to walk from miles and miles to the
Oo91hfKtl60,24480958,24486958,marketplace to sell a spot a cow  so without further ado he agreed to this
Oo91hfKtl60,24486958,24494478,deal jack and the old man shook hands  the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed
Oo91hfKtl60,24494478,24501040,for home  when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit
Oo91hfKtl60,24501040,24507360,she got very very scared she thought  he'd been robbed by the highwayman but
Oo91hfKtl60,24507360,24513680,jack told her  don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for
Oo91hfKtl60,24513680,24520240,your old spotted cow i got a brand new  little bean and i have never seen a
Oo91hfKtl60,24520240,24528478,nicer shade of green  the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,24528478,24534000,my son then she grabbed the bean and  threw it out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,24534000,24541280,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,24541280,24548080,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,24548080,24553840,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,24553840,24558958,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,24558958,24564718,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,24564718,24570478,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,24570478,24576958,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,24576958,24582160,should he give it another try why bother  hey you
Oo91hfKtl60,24582160,24588718,up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,24588718,24593920,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,24593920,24599200,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,24599200,24606160,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,24606160,24611520,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,24611520,24618080,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,24618080,24625440,princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,24625440,24632798,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,24632798,24640000,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,25044130,25047900,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,25050700,25056160,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,25056160,25063040,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,25063040,25069520,not going the way it dude  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,25069520,25076558,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,25076558,25083440,force nearby i lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,25083440,25089280,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,25089280,25094638,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,25094638,25101200,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,25101200,25107200,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,25107200,25112638,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,25112638,25120080,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,25120080,25127120,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,25127120,25132638,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,25132638,25139920,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,25139920,25146558,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,25146558,25153680,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  french and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,25153680,25160400,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,25160400,25165680,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,25165680,25172878,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,25172878,25180080,no the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,25180080,25187520,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,25187520,25192718,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,25192718,25199360,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,25199360,25206000,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,25206000,25212400,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,25212400,25218080,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,25218080,25223680,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,25223680,25229120,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,25229120,25234160,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,25234160,25240400,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,25240400,25245520,like a christmas tree only was great and  upside down and on the ceiling
Oo91hfKtl60,25245520,25250718,so the fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something
Oo91hfKtl60,25250718,25255760,sticking to his tail under the water so  he became happy and sang even louder we
Oo91hfKtl60,25255760,25262638,decorate the christmas tree and start to  celebrate  and the fish became happy too and
Oo91hfKtl60,25262638,25269360,started dancing around their decorated  christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his
Oo91hfKtl60,25269360,25274718,tail out he pulled once nothing happened  he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch
Oo91hfKtl60,25274718,25282320,that's when the wolf started spanning  someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull
Oo91hfKtl60,25282320,25290000,it out you know what really happened to  the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,25290000,25295440,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,25295440,25302478,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,25302478,25308718,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,25308718,25314718,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,25314718,25322718,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,25322718,25328798,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog that i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,25328798,25335440,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,25335440,25341200,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,25341200,25346320,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,25346320,25354740,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  tasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,26210080,26215840,would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,26215840,26221760,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,26221760,26228958,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,26228958,26234638,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,26234638,26242398,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,26242398,26249360,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,26249360,26255600,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,26255600,26261600,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,26261600,26267920,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,26267920,26275040,then the farmer came over and started to  revive the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,26275040,26282718,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,26282718,26288878,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,26288878,26296000,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me a farmer looked at the bear and
Oo91hfKtl60,26296000,26302478,pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you  the bear looked back at the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,26302478,26309040,speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his  stomach making hungry noises
Oo91hfKtl60,26309040,26314798,the poor bear he was really hungry  so he walked up to the farmer and asked
Oo91hfKtl60,26314798,26319840,can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,26319840,26326240,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,26326240,26332398,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,26332398,26338398,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,26338398,26345200,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,26345200,26351120,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,26351120,26356958,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,26356958,26362958,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,26362958,26368320,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,26368320,26374558,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,26374558,26380080,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,26380080,26385920,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,26385920,26392718,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now he will
Oo91hfKtl60,26392718,26398878,wake up  so he raised the flies watch her and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,26398878,26404558,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,26404558,26411600,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,26411600,26419440,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,26419440,26424558,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,26424558,26431600,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,26431600,26446870,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,26895040,26902638,my little toy friends i can't play with  you right now i'm protecting the  vegetable garden from all the pests
Oo91hfKtl60,26902638,26908840,okay never mind i wouldn't want you to  get bored  so let me tell you a fairy
Oo91hfKtl60,26908840,26914080,tale jack and the beanstalk there was a  poor widow who lived in a village and
Oo91hfKtl60,26914080,26919360,she had a son named jack the widow and  her son spent all day long taking in
Oo91hfKtl60,26919360,26924558,their vegetable garden whatever grew in  that vegetable garden that was what they
Oo91hfKtl60,26924558,26931600,ate then the time came for jack to get  married there was as many maids in the  village as there were carrots in the
Oo91hfKtl60,26931600,26938958,patches only all of them turned jack  down  it's no wonder they refused to marry him
Oo91hfKtl60,26938958,26944878,who would have wanted a groom like that  his pants were torn and had patches his
Oo91hfKtl60,26944878,26950080,shoes had holes into the soles and his  hat was as flat as a pancake
Oo91hfKtl60,26950080,26955280,no one would marry him no one would even  go out with poor jack the widow knew he
Oo91hfKtl60,26955280,26962478,needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she  thought very hard and very long and then
Oo91hfKtl60,26962478,26969200,she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get  married you need to look presentable
Oo91hfKtl60,26969200,26974398,i've thought long and hard about this  and there's nothing left to do but to
Oo91hfKtl60,26974398,26982000,sell our spotted cow  with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit so jack put a leash
Oo91hfKtl60,26982000,26988000,on the cow and headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was
Oo91hfKtl60,26988000,26995200,halfway to the market when he got tired  and laid down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,26995200,27001760,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,27001760,27008080,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,27008080,27013120,yours and in exchange for your account  will give you a nice little bean
Oo91hfKtl60,27013120,27018240,to tell you the truth jack really didn't  want to walk from miles and miles to the
Oo91hfKtl60,27018240,27024240,marketplace to sell a spot a cow  so without further ado he agreed to this
Oo91hfKtl60,27024240,27031760,deal jack and the old man shook hands  the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed
Oo91hfKtl60,27031760,27038320,for home  when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit
Oo91hfKtl60,27038320,27046958,she got very very scared  she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her don't you
Oo91hfKtl60,27046958,27053600,worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,27053600,27060000,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,27060000,27065760,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,27065760,27071280,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,27071280,27078558,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  she yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,27078558,27085440,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,27085440,27091120,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,27091120,27096240,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,27096240,27102000,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,27102000,27107840,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,27107840,27114240,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,27114240,27120638,should he give it another try why bother  hey you up there
Oo91hfKtl60,27120638,27126000,shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,27126000,27131200,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,27131200,27136558,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,27136558,27143440,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,27143440,27148798,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,27148798,27155120,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid
Oo91hfKtl60,27155120,27160160,the princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said i probably have
Oo91hfKtl60,27160160,27166958,bruises all over my body because i slept  on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,27166958,27172080,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride
Oo91hfKtl60,27172080,27177280,that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,27177280,27182398,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very

Oo91hfKtl60,27587990,27593440,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,27593440,27600320,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,27600320,27606878,not going the way it chewed  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,27606878,27613920,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,27613920,27620718,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,27620718,27626558,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,27626558,27631920,waiting for christmas to come  so he said just wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,27631920,27638478,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,27638478,27644478,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,27644478,27650000,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,27650000,27657360,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,27657360,27664798,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,27664798,27670320,there for a long time and even started  to doze off it wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,27670320,27677200,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,27677200,27683040,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,27683040,27688558,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,27688558,27695360,french and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,27695360,27703040,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,27703040,27710160,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,27710160,27717440,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,27717440,27722638,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you the wolf got
Oo91hfKtl60,27722638,27730000,really sad  where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,27730000,27736638,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,27736638,27743280,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,27743280,27749680,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,27749680,27755360,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,27755360,27760958,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,27760958,27766398,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,27766398,27771440,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,27771440,27777680,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,27777680,27782798,like a christmas tree only was grey and  upside down and on the ceiling
Oo91hfKtl60,27782798,27788080,so the fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something
Oo91hfKtl60,27788080,27796000,sticking to his tail under the water so  he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,27796000,27802160,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,27802160,27809200,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,27809200,27815040,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,27815040,27821760,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,27821760,27827280,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,27827280,27832718,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,27832718,27839840,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,27839840,27846000,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,27846000,27852080,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,27852080,27860000,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,27860000,27866080,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog then i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,27866080,27872718,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,27872718,27878478,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,27878478,27883600,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,27883600,27892030,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  tasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,28677040,28683440,like to do my share of oh sharing  i know sharing is caring but we're not
Oo91hfKtl60,28683440,28690558,talking about me here so i'd better tell  you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village
Oo91hfKtl60,28690558,28698240,the tops and the roots and nearby was  the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,28698240,28703440,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,28703440,28708798,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,28708798,28716320,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here well
Oo91hfKtl60,28716320,28722000,bear i need to plow the field plant the  seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,28722000,28728718,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,28728718,28734958,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,28734958,28741120,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,28741120,28747040,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,28747040,28753120,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,28753120,28758958,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,28758958,28765280,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal
Oo91hfKtl60,28765280,28771840,so here's the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,28771840,28779600,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,28779600,28786638,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,28786638,28792798,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,28792798,28798798,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,28798798,28805120,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,28805120,28812240,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,28812240,28819920,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,28819920,28826080,here are your tops  bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,28826080,28831440,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,28831440,28837840,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,28837840,28844000,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,28844000,28850000,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,28850000,28857040,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,28857040,28863440,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,28863440,28869520,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,28869520,28875600,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,28875600,28882240,my bed with this  choose the flies away and if they wake  me up i'll throw you out and you will
Oo91hfKtl60,28882240,28888320,not get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,28888320,28894160,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,28894160,28900160,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,28900160,28905520,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,28905520,28911680,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,28911680,28917280,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,28917280,28923200,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,28923200,28929440,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,28929440,28936080,he will wake up  so he raised the flies to watch her and  hit the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,28936080,28941760,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,28941760,28948798,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,28948798,28954398,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips
Oo91hfKtl60,28954398,28961760,grabbed the bags and ran off with them  into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,28961760,28968878,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,28968878,28984088,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,29425980,29431230,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,29432000,29437040,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,29437040,29443680,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,29443680,29449360,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,29449360,29454478,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,29454478,29459520,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden whatever grew in that
Oo91hfKtl60,29459520,29466718,vegetable garden that was what they ate  then the time came for jack to get  married there was as many maids in the
Oo91hfKtl60,29466718,29473360,village as there were carrots in the  patches only all of them turned jack  down
Oo91hfKtl60,29473360,29479200,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,29479200,29484798,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,29484798,29489840,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,29489840,29497040,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,29497040,29503680,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,29503680,29508878,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,29508878,29515120,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow with the money you
Oo91hfKtl60,29515120,29520398,get you can buy yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,29520398,29525920,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,29525920,29532398,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,29532398,29538958,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,29538958,29545280,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,29545280,29550320,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean
Oo91hfKtl60,29550320,29555520,to tell you the truth jack really didn't  want to walk from miles and miles to the
Oo91hfKtl60,29555520,29561440,marketplace to sell a spot a cow  so without further ado he agreed to this
Oo91hfKtl60,29561440,29568958,deal jack and the old man shook hands  the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed
Oo91hfKtl60,29568958,29575520,for home  when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit
Oo91hfKtl60,29575520,29584160,she got very very scared  she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her don't you
Oo91hfKtl60,29584160,29590798,worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,29590798,29597200,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,29597200,29603040,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,29603040,29608478,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,29608478,29615760,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,29615760,29622638,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,29622638,29628320,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,29628320,29633440,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,29633440,29639200,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,29639200,29645040,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,29645040,29651440,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,29651440,29656638,should he give it another try why bother  hey you
Oo91hfKtl60,29656638,29663200,up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,29663200,29668398,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,29668398,29673760,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,29673760,29680718,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,29680718,29686000,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,29686000,29692398,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid
Oo91hfKtl60,29692398,29699200,the princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said  i probably have bruises all over my body
Oo91hfKtl60,29699200,29707360,because i slept on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,29707360,29714478,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,30125200,30130718,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,30130718,30137600,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,30137600,30145040,not going the way it should  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it the wolf and the
Oo91hfKtl60,30145040,30150638,fox  in a village far far away there was a  man a local fisherman and his wife and
Oo91hfKtl60,30150638,30156840,then in the force nearby lived a very  sly wolf who was always sneaking over  and stealing fish from the
Oo91hfKtl60,30156840,30161920,fishermen when it was christmas time the  men decorated the christmas tree but he
Oo91hfKtl60,30161920,30169200,didn't feel like just sitting around  waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,30169200,30175680,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,30175680,30181680,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,30181680,30187200,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,30187200,30194558,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,30194558,30202000,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,30202000,30207520,there for a long time and even started  to doze off he wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,30207520,30214398,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,30214398,30221040,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,30221040,30228160,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  fret and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,30228160,30234878,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,30234878,30240240,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,30240240,30247440,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,30247440,30254638,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,30254638,30262080,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,30262080,30267200,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,30267200,30273840,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,30273840,30280478,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,30280478,30286878,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song  so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,30286878,30292558,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,30292558,30298160,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,30298160,30303600,all told and green the fish were  celebrating christmas in the water
Oo91hfKtl60,30303600,30308718,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,30308718,30314958,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,30314958,30320318,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,30320318,30327600,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,30327600,30333200,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,30333200,30339360,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,30339360,30346398,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,30346398,30352318,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,30352318,30358080,someone help me my towel is all fished  out i can't pull it out you know what
Oo91hfKtl60,30358080,30364478,really happened to the poor wolf's tail  while the wolf was singing the water  froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,30364478,30369920,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,30369920,30377040,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,30377040,30383200,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,30383200,30389280,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,30389280,30397200,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,30397200,30403280,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog the dog called the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,30403280,30408840,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the
Oo91hfKtl60,30408840,30413920,water of course there were no fish on  the trip just a bunch of christmas
Oo91hfKtl60,30413920,30420798,decorations  and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,31217760,31223760,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,31223760,31230318,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,31230318,31235440,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,31235440,31240638,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,31240638,31246000,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,31246000,31251280,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him hey farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,31251280,31259200,what are you doing here  well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,31259200,31265920,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,31265920,31272160,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,31272160,31278318,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,31278318,31284240,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,31284240,31290318,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,31290318,31296160,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,31296160,31302478,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal
Oo91hfKtl60,31302478,31309040,so here's the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,31309040,31316798,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,31316798,31322558,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow come on my little pony run
Oo91hfKtl60,31322558,31329200,faster  anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,31329200,31336080,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,31336080,31342318,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,31342318,31349440,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,31349440,31357120,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,31357120,31363280,here are your tops  bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,31363280,31368638,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,31368638,31375040,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,31375040,31381120,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,31381120,31387200,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,31387200,31394240,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,31394240,31400718,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant ten roast bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,31400718,31406798,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,31406798,31412798,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,31412798,31417920,my bed with this  two supplies away and if they wake me up
Oo91hfKtl60,31417920,31425520,i'll throw you out and you will not get  any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,31425520,31431360,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,31431360,31437360,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,31437360,31442718,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,31442718,31448958,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,31448958,31454478,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,31454478,31460398,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,31460398,31466638,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,31466638,31473280,he will wake up  so he raised the flies to watch her and  hit the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,31473280,31478798,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose
Oo91hfKtl60,31478798,31486000,the farmer jumped up holding his nose  and screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,31486000,31493840,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,31493840,31498958,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,31498958,31506080,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,31506080,31518622,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,31969200,31974318,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,31974318,31980878,vegetable garden from all the pests  never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,31980878,31986558,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,31986558,31991680,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,31991680,31998000,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,31998000,32005120,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,32005120,32010558,were tears in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,32010558,32016398,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,32016398,32022000,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,32022000,32027040,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,32027040,32034240,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,32034240,32040878,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,32040878,32046080,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,32046080,32051120,and there's nothing left to do  but to sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,32051120,32057600,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,32057600,32063120,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,32063120,32069600,market when he got tired and lay down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,32069600,32074840,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old
Oo91hfKtl60,32074840,32079920,mane jack was very surprised and the old  man told him
Oo91hfKtl60,32079920,32087520,my boy let me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean
Oo91hfKtl60,32087520,32092718,to tell you the truth jack really didn't  want to walk from miles and miles to the
Oo91hfKtl60,32092718,32098638,marketplace to sell his spot a cow  so without further ado he agreed to this
Oo91hfKtl60,32098638,32106160,deal jack and the old man shook hands  the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed
Oo91hfKtl60,32106160,32112718,for home  when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit
Oo91hfKtl60,32112718,32120798,she got very very scared  she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,32120798,32128000,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,32128000,32134398,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,32134398,32140240,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,32140240,32145680,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,32145680,32152958,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,32152958,32159840,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,32159840,32165520,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,32165520,32170638,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,32170638,32176398,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,32176398,32182240,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,32182240,32188638,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,32188638,32193840,should he give it another try why bother  hey you
Oo91hfKtl60,32193840,32200398,up there  shadow jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,32200398,32205600,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,32205600,32210958,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,32210958,32217920,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,32217920,32223200,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,32223200,32229760,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,32229760,32237200,princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,32237200,32244558,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,32244558,32251680,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,32251680,32256878,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very
Oo91hfKtl60,32256878,32264240,interesting in my vegetable patch too  just like jack but i have to make sure  no pets get into my beautiful garden
Oo91hfKtl60,32264240,32272208,so i'll say goodbye now i have to go  stand guard  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,32655840,32659600,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,32662410,32667920,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,32667920,32674798,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,32674798,32681280,not going the way it should do you know  what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,32681280,32687840,the wolf and the fox  in a village far far away there was a  man a local fisherman and his wife and
Oo91hfKtl60,32687840,32695120,then in the fourth nearby lived a very  sly wolf who was always sneaking over  and stealing fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,32695120,32700958,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,32700958,32706398,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,32706398,32712878,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,32712878,32718878,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,32718878,32724398,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,32724398,32731760,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,32731760,32739200,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,32739200,32744718,there for a long time and even started  to doze off he wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,32744718,32751600,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,32751600,32758318,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,32758318,32765360,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  fret and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,32765360,32772078,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,32772078,32777438,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,32777438,32784640,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,32784640,32791840,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,32791840,32799278,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,32799278,32804398,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,32804398,32811040,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,32811040,32817680,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,32817680,32824078,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,32824078,32829758,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,32829758,32835360,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,32835360,32840800,all told and green the fish were  celebrating christmas in the water
Oo91hfKtl60,32840800,32845918,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,32845918,32852160,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,32852160,32857520,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,32857520,32864800,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,32864800,32870398,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,32870398,32876558,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,32876558,32883598,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,32883598,32889520,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spawning
Oo91hfKtl60,32889520,32896160,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,32896160,32901680,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,32901680,32907122,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,32907122,32914238,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,32914238,32919278,ran to the wolf together they tried to  pull the tail out of the water but they
Oo91hfKtl60,32919278,32926480,couldn't do it okay fox said the wolf go  get the fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,32926480,32934398,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,32934398,32940480,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog the dog called the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,32940480,32947122,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,32947122,32952878,of course there were no fish on the  trail just a bunch of christmas  decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,32952878,32958000,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,32958000,32966450,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  toasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,33755040,33760960,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,33760960,33767520,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,33767520,33772720,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,33772720,33777840,the bear saw the final red his car over  to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,33777840,33783200,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,33783200,33790400,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,33790400,33796400,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,33796400,33803120,what i really  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,33803120,33809360,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,33809360,33815520,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,33815520,33821436,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,33821436,33827520,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,33827520,33833360,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,33833360,33840640,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,33840640,33846240,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,33846240,33854480,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed with the
Oo91hfKtl60,33854480,33861040,farmer hurrying him from behind the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,33861040,33866400,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,33866400,33873276,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,33873276,33879520,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,33879520,33886720,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,33886720,33894320,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,33894320,33900560,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,33900560,33905840,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,33905840,33912320,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,33912320,33918400,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,33918400,33924480,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,33924480,33931436,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,33931436,33937916,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,33937916,33944000,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,33944000,33950000,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,33950000,33955916,my bed with this cheese the flies away  and if they wake me up i'll throw you
Oo91hfKtl60,33955916,33962800,out and you will not get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,33962800,33968560,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,33968560,33974560,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,33974560,33979916,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,33979916,33986160,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,33986160,33991680,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,33991680,33997596,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,33997596,34003840,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,34003840,34010480,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,34010480,34016000,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose
Oo91hfKtl60,34016000,34023200,the farmer jumped up holding his nose  and screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,34023200,34031040,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,34031040,34036160,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,34036160,34043276,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,34043276,34058500,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,34500372,34505640,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,34506400,34511436,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,34511436,34518080,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,34518080,34523756,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,34523756,34528880,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,34528880,34535200,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,34535200,34542320,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,34542320,34547756,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,34547756,34553596,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,34553596,34559200,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,34559200,34564240,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,34564240,34571436,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,34571436,34578080,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,34578080,34583276,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,34583276,34588400,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,34588400,34594800,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,34594800,34601916,headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was  halfway to the market when he got tired
Oo91hfKtl60,34601916,34609436,and lay down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt  something poking at his side
Oo91hfKtl60,34609436,34615840,he opened his eyes and saw an old mane  jack was very surprised and the old man
Oo91hfKtl60,34615840,34622000,told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your cow will
Oo91hfKtl60,34622000,34627200,give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,34627200,34632800,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,34632800,34638640,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,34638640,34645040,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,34645040,34652640,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,34652640,34658000,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,34658000,34665200,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,34665200,34671596,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,34671596,34677436,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,34677436,34682880,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,34682880,34690160,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,34690160,34697040,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,34697040,34702720,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,34702720,34707840,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,34707840,34713596,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,34713596,34719436,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,34719436,34725840,to climb up the bean tree he fell down  once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,34725840,34732320,should he give it another try why bother  hey you up there
Oo91hfKtl60,34732320,34737596,shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,34737596,34742880,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,34742880,34748160,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,34748160,34753756,to him from above jack looked closely  and saw this rope resemble the girl's
Oo91hfKtl60,34753756,34760400,braid  jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,34760400,34766960,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,34766960,34774400,princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,34774400,34781756,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,34781756,34788960,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,35193052,35196820,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,35199620,35205120,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,35205120,35212000,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,35212000,35218480,not going the way it shoot  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,35218480,35225520,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,35225520,35232400,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,35232400,35238240,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,35238240,35243596,waiting for christmas to come  so he said just right i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,35243596,35250080,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,35250080,35256160,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,35256160,35261596,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,35261596,35268960,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,35268960,35276400,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,35276400,35281916,there for a long time and even started  to doze off it wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,35281916,35288800,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,35288800,35295520,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,35295520,35302560,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  french and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,35302560,35309276,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,35309276,35314640,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,35314640,35321840,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,35321840,35329040,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,35329040,35336480,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,35336480,35341596,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,35341596,35348240,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,35348240,35354880,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,35354880,35361360,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,35361360,35366960,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,35366960,35372560,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,35372560,35378000,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,35378000,35383120,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,35383120,35389360,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,35389360,35394400,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling
Oo91hfKtl60,35394400,35399680,so the fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something
Oo91hfKtl60,35399680,35407680,sticking to his tail under the water so  he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,35407680,35413840,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,35413840,35420800,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,35420800,35426720,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,35426720,35433360,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,35433360,35438960,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,35438960,35444320,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,35444320,35451436,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and mean nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,35451436,35457596,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,35457596,35463680,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,35463680,35471680,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,35471680,35477680,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog that i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,35477680,35484400,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,35484400,35490080,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,35490080,35495200,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,35495200,35500240,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than

Oo91hfKtl60,36292240,36298160,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,36298160,36304720,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,36304720,36309916,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,36309916,36315040,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,36315040,36322240,jumped down and started digging  something up with a shovel the bear  wanted to find out what was going on but
Oo91hfKtl60,36322240,36327596,he approached the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,36327596,36333596,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,36333596,36340320,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,36340320,36346560,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,36346560,36352720,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,36352720,36358720,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,36358720,36364720,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,36364720,36370560,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,36370560,36377840,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,36377840,36383520,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,36383520,36391276,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,36391276,36398240,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,36398240,36403596,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,36403596,36410480,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,36410480,36416800,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,36416800,36423916,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,36423916,36431520,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,36431520,36437756,here are your tops  bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,36437756,36443120,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,36443120,36449520,a farmer looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,36449520,36455596,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,36455596,36461680,stomach making hungry noises the poor  bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,36461680,36468640,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,36468640,36475120,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,36475120,36481200,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,36481200,36487200,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,36487200,36493840,my bed with this  choose the flies away and if they wake  me up i'll throw you out and you will
Oo91hfKtl60,36493840,36500000,not get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,36500000,36505756,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,36505756,36511756,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,36511756,36517120,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,36517120,36523360,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,36523360,36528880,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,36528880,36534800,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,36534800,36541040,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,36541040,36547680,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,36547680,36553360,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,36553360,36560400,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,36560400,36568320,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,36568320,36573360,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,36573360,36579520,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,36579520,36595712,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,37048720,37055360,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,37055360,37061040,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,37061040,37066080,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,37066080,37072400,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,37072400,37079520,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,37079520,37084960,were tears in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,37084960,37090800,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,37090800,37096400,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,37096400,37101436,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,37101436,37108640,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,37108640,37115276,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,37115276,37120480,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,37120480,37125596,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,37125596,37132080,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,37132080,37137520,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,37137520,37144000,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,37144000,37150640,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,37150640,37156960,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy lets me buy this cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,37156960,37164400,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,37164400,37170000,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,37170000,37175840,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,37175840,37182240,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,37182240,37189840,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,37189840,37195200,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,37195200,37202400,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,37202400,37208800,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,37208800,37214640,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,37214640,37220160,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,37220160,37227360,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,37227360,37234240,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,37234240,37240000,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,37240000,37245040,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,37245040,37250800,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,37250800,37258240,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,37258240,37267040,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,37267040,37274800,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean

Oo91hfKtl60,37285360,37292320,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,37292320,37297596,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,37297596,37304000,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid

Oo91hfKtl60,37736828,37742320,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,37742320,37749200,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,37749200,37755680,not going the way it shoot  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,37755680,37762720,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,37762720,37769596,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,37769596,37775436,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,37775436,37780800,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,37780800,37787360,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,37787360,37793360,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,37793360,37798800,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,37798800,37806160,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,37806160,37813596,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,37813596,37819120,there for a long time and even started  to doze off it wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,37819120,37826080,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,37826080,37831916,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,37831916,37837360,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,37837360,37844240,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,37844240,37851840,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,37851840,37859040,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,37859040,37866240,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,37866240,37873680,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,37873680,37878800,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,37878800,37885436,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,37885436,37892080,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,37892080,37898560,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,37898560,37904160,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,37904160,37909840,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,37909840,37915276,up told lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,37915276,37920320,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,37920320,37926560,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,37926560,37932000,like a christmas tree only was great and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,37932000,37939200,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,37939200,37944880,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,37944880,37951040,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,37951040,37958000,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,37958000,37963916,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,37963916,37970560,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,37970560,37976160,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,37976160,37981520,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,37981520,37988640,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,37988640,37994880,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,37994880,38000880,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,38000880,38008880,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,38008880,38014960,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog then i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,38014960,38021596,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,38021596,38027276,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,38027276,38032400,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,38829520,38835436,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,38835436,38842000,you a fairy tale  there was a fiber living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,38842000,38847200,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,38847200,38852320,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,38852320,38857680,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,38857680,38864960,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,38864960,38870880,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,38870880,38877596,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,38877596,38883840,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,38883840,38890000,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,38890000,38896000,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,38896000,38902000,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,38902000,38909596,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer we have a deal
Oo91hfKtl60,38909596,38915116,i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,38915116,38920800,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,38920800,38928560,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,38928560,38935520,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,38935520,38941756,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,38941756,38947756,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the churnips and  took them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,38947756,38954080,where he threw them into a heap the poor  bear was so tired he could barely stand

Oo91hfKtl60,788480,793600,the bear saw the finally read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,793600,798959,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,798959,806240,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here

Oo91hfKtl60,1516170,1521429,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,1522159,1527279,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,1527279,1533919,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,1533919,1539600,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,1539600,1544640,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,1544640,1551039,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,1551039,1558080,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,1558080,1563520,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,1563520,1569360,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,1569360,1574960,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,1574960,1580000,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,1580000,1587039,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it
Oo91hfKtl60,1587039,1593840,she thought very hard and very long and  then she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,1593840,1599039,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,1599039,1604159,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,1604159,1609440,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit so jack put a leash
Oo91hfKtl60,1609440,1615440,on the cow and headed to the market but  the road was long and tiring he was
Oo91hfKtl60,1615440,1622559,halfway to the market when he got tired  and laid down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,1622559,1629200,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,1629200,1635520,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,1635520,1643039,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,1643039,1648559,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,1648559,1654399,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,1654399,1660799,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,1660799,1668480,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,1668480,1673760,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,1673760,1681039,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,1681039,1687360,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,1687360,1693200,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,1693200,1698720,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,1698720,1706000,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,1706000,1712799,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,1712799,1718559,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,1718559,1723679,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,1723679,1729440,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,1729440,1735200,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,1735200,1741679,to climb up the bean tree he fell down  once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,1741679,1748080,should he give it another try why bother  hey you up there
Oo91hfKtl60,1748080,1753440,shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,1753440,1758640,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,1758640,1763919,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,1763919,1769520,to him from above jack looked closely  and saw this rope resemble the girl's
Oo91hfKtl60,1769520,1776240,braid  jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,1776240,1782799,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,1782799,1788159,princess straightened out her crown curt  seed and said i probably have bruises
Oo91hfKtl60,1788159,1794399,all over my body because i slept on all  those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,1794399,1799520,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride
Oo91hfKtl60,1799520,1804720,that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,2215410,2220880,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,2220880,2227760,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,2227760,2234240,not going the way it chewed  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,2234240,2241280,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,2241280,2248160,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,2248160,2254000,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,2254000,2260800,waiting for christmas to come  so he citrus rife i'm going fishing dear
Oo91hfKtl60,2260800,2265920,the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,2265920,2271920,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,2271920,2277359,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,2277359,2284720,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,2284720,2291839,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,2291839,2297359,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off it wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,2297359,2304640,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,2304640,2310480,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,2310480,2316000,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost had a
Oo91hfKtl60,2316000,2322800,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,2322800,2330400,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,2330400,2337599,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,2337599,2344800,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,2344800,2352240,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,2352240,2357440,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,2357440,2364000,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,2364000,2370640,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,2370640,2377119,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,2377119,2382800,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,2382800,2388400,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,2388400,2393839,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,2393839,2398880,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,2398880,2405119,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,2405119,2410560,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,2410560,2417760,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,2417760,2423440,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,2423440,2429599,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,2429599,2436640,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,2436640,2442480,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spawning
Oo91hfKtl60,2442480,2449119,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,2449119,2454720,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,2454720,2460160,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,2460160,2467200,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,2467200,2473440,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,2473440,2479440,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,2479440,2487440,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,2487440,2493520,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog that i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,2493520,2500160,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,2500160,2505920,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,2505920,2511040,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,2511040,2519450,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  toasted cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,3308000,3313920,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,3313920,3320480,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,3320480,3325680,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,3325680,3330799,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,3330799,3336160,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,3336160,3343359,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,3343359,3349359,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,3349359,3356079,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,3356079,3363920,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest the farmer scratched the back of
Oo91hfKtl60,3363920,3369359,his head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you  some
Oo91hfKtl60,3369359,3374400,tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,3374400,3380480,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,3380480,3386319,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,3386319,3393599,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,3393599,3399200,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,3399200,3404240,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice
Oo91hfKtl60,3404240,3409280,he worked and huffed and puffed  with the farmer hurrying him from behind
Oo91hfKtl60,3409280,3416480,the plow  come on my little pony run faster  anyway they plowed the fields planted
Oo91hfKtl60,3416480,3422240,the seeds and then boom  they got lots and lots of turnips
Oo91hfKtl60,3422240,3428720,the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house  where he threw them into a heap
Oo91hfKtl60,3428720,3435200,the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand  then the farmer came over and started to
Oo91hfKtl60,3435200,3442400,divide the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and  told the bear these are my roots
Oo91hfKtl60,3442400,3451119,he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right  here are your tops bon appetit bear
Oo91hfKtl60,3451119,3458000,the bear tasted them and said ew this  tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to
Oo91hfKtl60,3458000,3463200,me  a farmer looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked
Oo91hfKtl60,3463200,3469280,for the tops didn't you  the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his
Oo91hfKtl60,3469280,3477440,jaw dropped and you could hear his  stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,3477440,3484400,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,3484400,3490880,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,3490880,3496960,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,3496960,3502960,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,3502960,3509760,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,3509760,3515760,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,3515760,3521520,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,3521520,3527520,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,3527520,3532880,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,3532880,3539119,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,3539119,3544640,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,3544640,3550559,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,3550559,3556799,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,3556799,3563440,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,3563440,3569119,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,3569119,3576160,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,3576160,3584000,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,3584000,3589119,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,3589119,3595280,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,3595280,3613119,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,4059359,4064480,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,4064480,4071039,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,4071039,4076799,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,4076799,4081839,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,4081839,4088160,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,4088160,4095280,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,4095280,4100719,were tears in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,4100719,4106560,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,4106560,4112159,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,4112159,4117199,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,4117199,4124400,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,4124400,4131040,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,4131040,4136238,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,4136238,4141359,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,4141359,4147758,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,4147758,4153278,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,4153278,4159758,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,4159758,4166400,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,4166400,4172719,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy lets me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,4172719,4180159,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,4180159,4185758,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,4185758,4191600,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,4191600,4198000,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,4198000,4205600,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,4205600,4210960,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,4210960,4218159,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,4218159,4224560,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,4224560,4230400,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,4230400,4235840,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,4235840,4243120,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,4243120,4250000,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,4250000,4255679,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,4255679,4260800,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,4260800,4266560,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,4266560,4274000,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,4274000,4282800,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,4282800,4290560,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,4290560,4295840,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,4295840,4301120,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,4301120,4308080,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,4308080,4313440,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,4313440,4319760,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid
Oo91hfKtl60,4319760,4324800,the princess straightened out her crown  curt seed and said i probably have
Oo91hfKtl60,4324800,4331600,bruises all over my body because i slept  on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,4331600,4336719,down off the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride
Oo91hfKtl60,4336719,4341920,that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,4341920,4347040,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very
Oo91hfKtl60,4347040,4354400,interesting in my vegetable patch too  just like jack but i have to make sure  no pets get into my beautiful garden
Oo91hfKtl60,4354400,4401679,so i'll say goodbye now i have to go  stand guard  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,4752590,4758080,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,4758080,4764080,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake not so my dear friends if
Oo91hfKtl60,4764080,4769360,decorating is not going the way it  chewed  do you know what can happen
Oo91hfKtl60,4769360,4774480,i'll tell you about it  the wolf and the fox in a village far
Oo91hfKtl60,4774480,4781199,far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the  force nearby lived a very sly wolf who
Oo91hfKtl60,4781199,4787199,was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen  when it was christmas time the men
Oo91hfKtl60,4787199,4794159,decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around  waiting for christmas to come
Oo91hfKtl60,4794159,4800719,so he said to his wife i'm going fishing  dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was
Oo91hfKtl60,4800719,4805920,going fishing  so this very sly fox ran out of force on
Oo91hfKtl60,4805920,4812400,the road and slaying down and pretended  to be absolutely not alive
Oo91hfKtl60,4812400,4819520,when the man saw the fox  he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,4819520,4824800,into the sleigh and together they drove  up the man's favorite spot the fisherman
Oo91hfKtl60,4824800,4831840,sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting  there for a long time and even started
Oo91hfKtl60,4831840,4839280,to doze off it wasn't having any luck  catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and
Oo91hfKtl60,4839280,4845840,she sat up and started to watch from the  sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed
Oo91hfKtl60,4845840,4853120,behind the fox's back  what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,4853120,4860000,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,4860000,4867600,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,4867600,4874800,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,4874800,4882000,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,4882000,4889440,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,4889440,4894560,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,4894560,4901199,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,4901199,4907840,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,4907840,4914320,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,4914320,4919920,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,4919920,4927440,into it  and then sang the christmas tree grew in  the pony grew all told and green
Oo91hfKtl60,4927440,4933600,the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water  just like the humans they even had a
Oo91hfKtl60,4933600,4939920,cake but what they didn't have was a  christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow
Oo91hfKtl60,4939920,4947760,bigger in the water and started to look  like a christmas tree only was great and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,4947760,4954960,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,4954960,4960639,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,4960639,4966800,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,4966800,4973760,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,4973760,4979679,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,4979679,4986320,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,4986320,4991920,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,4991920,4997280,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,4997280,5004400,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,5004400,5010639,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,5010639,5015840,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen you see we're stuck we need
Oo91hfKtl60,5015840,5020880,help the fishermen grabbed the fox the  fox grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed
Oo91hfKtl60,5020880,5026719,his tail but they couldn't pull it out  the fisherman called his wife his wife
Oo91hfKtl60,5026719,5032639,called the dog then i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse  all together they pulled and pulled with
Oo91hfKtl60,5032639,5039360,all their might and the tail came out of  the water  of course there were no fish on the
Oo91hfKtl60,5039360,5046320,trail just a bunch of christmas  decorations  and that moment the fireworks started
Oo91hfKtl60,5046320,5053199,that's what i'm telling you during the  holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than

Oo91hfKtl60,5848000,5853040,talking about me here so i'd better tell  you a fairy tale
Oo91hfKtl60,5853040,5860080,there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was  the forest with all sorts of creatures
Oo91hfKtl60,5860080,5868000,living in it including the bear one day  the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,5868000,5873360,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,5873360,5880560,out what was going on but he pushed the  farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,5880560,5886560,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,5886560,5893280,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,5893280,5899520,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,5899520,5905679,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,5905679,5911679,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops of the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,5911679,5917679,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,5917679,5923520,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,5923520,5930800,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,5930800,5936480,the pow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,5936480,5944239,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,5944239,5951199,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,5951199,5957360,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,5957360,5963440,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,5963440,5969760,where he threw them into a heap the poor  bear was so tired he could barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,5969760,5976880,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,5976880,5984480,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,5984480,5990719,here are your tops bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,5990719,5996080,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,5996080,6002480,a farmer looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,6002480,6008560,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,6008560,6014639,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,6014639,6021600,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,6021600,6028080,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,6028080,6034159,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,6034159,6040159,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,6040159,6046960,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,6046960,6052960,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,6052960,6058719,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,6058719,6064719,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,6064719,6070080,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,6070080,6076400,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,6076400,6081840,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,6081840,6087760,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,6087760,6094080,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,6094080,6100639,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,6100639,6106320,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,6106320,6113360,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,6113360,6121280,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,6121280,6126320,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,6126320,6132480,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,6132480,6148670,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,6590570,6595820,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,6596560,6601679,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i am protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,6601679,6608320,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,6608320,6614000,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,6614000,6619040,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,6619040,6625360,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,6625360,6632480,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,6632480,6639520,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack  down it's no wonder they refused to
Oo91hfKtl60,6639520,6646639,marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that  his pants were torn and had patches his
Oo91hfKtl60,6646639,6652400,shoes had holes into the soles and his  hat was as flat as a pancake no one
Oo91hfKtl60,6652400,6657440,would marry him no one would even go out  with poor jack the widow knew he needed
Oo91hfKtl60,6657440,6662480,nicer clothes but there was no money so  she thought about it she thought very
Oo91hfKtl60,6662480,6668239,hard and very long and then she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,6668239,6673440,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,6673440,6678560,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,6678560,6685040,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,6685040,6692080,headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was  halfway to the market when he got tired
Oo91hfKtl60,6692080,6699599,and lay down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt  something poking at his side
Oo91hfKtl60,6699599,6706000,he opened his eyes and saw an old mane  jack was very surprised and the old man
Oo91hfKtl60,6706000,6712239,told him  my boy lets me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your car will
Oo91hfKtl60,6712239,6717360,give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,6717360,6722960,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,6722960,6728800,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,6728800,6735199,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,6735199,6742800,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,6742800,6748159,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,6748159,6755360,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,6755360,6761760,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,6761760,6767599,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,6767599,6773119,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,6773119,6780320,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,6780320,6787199,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,6787199,6792960,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,6792960,6798000,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,6798000,6803760,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,6803760,6811199,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,6811199,6820000,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,6820000,6827760,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,6827760,6833040,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,6833040,6838320,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,6838320,6845280,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,6845280,6850639,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,6850639,6857119,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,6857119,6862560,princess straightened out her crown curt  seed and said i probably have bruises
Oo91hfKtl60,6862560,6868800,all over my body because i slept on all  those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,6868800,6873920,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride
Oo91hfKtl60,6873920,6879119,that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,6879119,6884239,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very
Oo91hfKtl60,6884239,6891599,interesting in my vegetable patch too  just like jack but i have to make sure  no pets get into my beautiful garden
Oo91hfKtl60,6891599,6916400,so i'll say goodbye now i have to go  stand guard  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,7283220,7286999,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,7289790,7295280,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,7295280,7302159,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,7302159,7308639,not going the way it shoot  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,7308639,7315199,the wolf and the fox  in a village far far away there was a  man a local fisherman and his wife and
Oo91hfKtl60,7315199,7322560,then in the force nearby lived a very  sly wolf who was always sneaking over  and stealing fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,7322560,7328400,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,7328400,7333760,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,7333760,7340320,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,7340320,7346320,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,7346320,7351760,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,7351760,7359119,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,7359119,7366239,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,7366239,7371679,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,7371679,7378880,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from
Oo91hfKtl60,7378880,7384880,this sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,7384880,7390320,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,7390320,7397199,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,7397199,7404800,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,7404800,7412000,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,7412000,7419199,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,7419199,7426639,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,7426639,7431840,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,7431840,7437920,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox but i don't know how to fish
Oo91hfKtl60,7437920,7445040,said the wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,7445040,7451520,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,7451520,7457119,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,7457119,7462800,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,7462800,7468239,all told lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,7468239,7473280,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,7473280,7479520,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,7479520,7484960,like a christmas tree only was grey and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,7484960,7492159,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,7492159,7497840,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,7497840,7504000,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,7504000,7510960,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,7510960,7516880,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,7516880,7523520,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,7523520,7529119,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,7529119,7534480,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,7534480,7541599,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,7541599,7547840,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,7547840,7553840,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,7553840,7560840,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it
Oo91hfKtl60,7560840,7567840,out the fisherman called his wife his  wife called the dog then i'll call the  cat the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,7567840,7574560,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,7574560,7580320,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,7580320,7585360,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,8371200,8377760,marsha's  tails go children always share  everything with others and do it the
Oo91hfKtl60,8377760,8385359,right way  i like to do my share of oh sharing  i know sharing is caring but we're not
Oo91hfKtl60,8385359,8392479,talking about me here so i'd better tell  you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village
Oo91hfKtl60,8392479,8400160,the tops and the roots and nearby was  the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,8400160,8405359,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,8405359,8410720,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,8410720,8417920,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,8417920,8423920,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,8423920,8430640,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,8430640,8436880,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,8436880,8443040,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,8443040,8448960,some tell me what part of the plants you  will take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,8448960,8455040,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,8455040,8460880,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,8460880,8467200,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal
Oo91hfKtl60,8467200,8473760,so here's the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,8473760,8481520,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,8481520,8488560,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,8488560,8493920,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,8493920,8500800,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,8500800,8507040,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,8507040,8514160,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,8514160,8521840,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,8521840,8528000,here are your tops  bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,8528000,8533359,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,8533359,8539760,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,8539760,8545920,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,8545920,8551920,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,8551920,8558960,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,8558960,8565439,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant ten roast bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,8565439,8571520,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,8571520,8577520,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,8577520,8582640,my bed with this  two supplies away and if they wake me up
Oo91hfKtl60,8582640,8590240,i'll throw you out and you will not get  any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,8590240,8596080,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,8596080,8602080,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,8602080,8607439,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,8607439,8613680,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,8613680,8619200,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,8619200,8625120,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,8625120,8631359,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,8631359,8638000,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,8638000,8643680,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,8643680,8650720,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,8650720,8658560,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,8658560,8663680,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,8663680,8670800,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,8670800,8686009,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,9133920,9138960,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,9138960,9145600,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,9145600,9151280,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,9151280,9156399,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,9156399,9162720,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,9162720,9169760,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,9169760,9175280,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,9175280,9181120,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,9181120,9186720,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,9186720,9191760,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,9191760,9198960,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,9198960,9205600,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,9205600,9210800,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,9210800,9215840,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,9215840,9222319,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,9222319,9227840,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,9227840,9234319,market when he got tired and lay down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,9234319,9240880,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,9240880,9247280,jack was very surprised  and the old man told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,9247280,9254720,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,9254720,9260319,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,9260319,9266160,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,9266160,9272560,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,9272560,9280160,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,9280160,9285520,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,9285520,9292720,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,9292720,9299120,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,9299120,9304960,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,9304960,9310399,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,9310399,9317680,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,9317680,9324560,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,9324560,9330240,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,9330240,9335359,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,9335359,9341120,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,9341120,9346960,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,9346960,9353359,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,9353359,9358560,should he give it another try why bother  hey you
Oo91hfKtl60,9358560,9365120,up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,9365120,9370319,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,9370319,9375680,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,9375680,9382640,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,9382640,9387680,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  goodie yank and a beautiful princess
Oo91hfKtl60,9387680,9394319,fell down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid
Oo91hfKtl60,9394319,9401920,the princess straightened out her crown  curt seed and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,9401920,9409280,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i'm
Oo91hfKtl60,9409280,9416399,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,9416399,9421600,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very
Oo91hfKtl60,9421600,9428960,interesting in my vegetable patch too  just like jack but i have to make sure  no pets get into my beautiful garden
Oo91hfKtl60,9428960,9436931,so i'll say goodbye now i have to go  stand guard  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,9812720,9819780,[Music]  i should not believe in miracles
Oo91hfKtl60,9819780,9824329,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,9827130,9832640,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,9832640,9839520,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,9839520,9846000,not going the way it should do you know  what can happen i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,9846000,9852560,the wolf and the fox  in a village far far away there was a  man a local fisherman and his wife and
Oo91hfKtl60,9852560,9859840,then in the fourth nearby lived a very  sly wolf who was always sneaking over  and stealing fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,9859840,9865680,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,9865680,9871120,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,9871120,9877600,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,9877600,9883600,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,9883600,9889120,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,9889120,9896479,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,9896479,9903920,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,9903920,9909439,there for a long time and even started  to doze off he wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,9909439,9916319,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,9916319,9923040,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,9923040,9930080,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  fret and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,9930080,9936800,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,9936800,9942160,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,9942160,9949359,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,9949359,9956560,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,9956560,9964000,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,9964000,9969120,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,9969120,9975760,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,9975760,9982399,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,9982399,9988800,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,9988800,9994479,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,9994479,10000080,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,10000080,10005520,all told and green the fish were  celebrating christmas in the water
Oo91hfKtl60,10005520,10010640,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,10010640,10016880,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,10016880,10022240,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,10022240,10029520,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,10029520,10035120,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,10035120,10041279,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,10041279,10048319,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,10048319,10054240,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,10054240,10060880,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,10060880,10066399,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,10066399,10071840,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,10071840,10078960,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,10078960,10085120,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,10085120,10091200,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,10091200,10099120,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,10099120,10105200,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog the dog called the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,10105200,10111840,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,10111840,10117600,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,10117600,10122720,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,10122720,10131170,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  toasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,10919680,10925680,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,10925680,10932240,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,10932240,10937439,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,10937439,10942560,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,10942560,10947920,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,10947920,10955120,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,10955120,10961120,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,10961120,10967840,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,10967840,10974080,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,10974080,10980240,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,10980240,10986160,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,10986160,10993200,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  ew they're so dirty so the bear told the
Oo91hfKtl60,10993200,10999840,farmer of course i will take the tops  fine said the farmer  we have a deal
Oo91hfKtl60,10999840,11006479,i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal  so here's the plow
Oo91hfKtl60,11006479,11012720,let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected  that he'd be asked to plow the field
Oo91hfKtl60,11012720,11018800,like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,11018800,11025760,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,11025760,11031120,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,11031120,11038000,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,11038000,11044240,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,11044240,11051439,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,11051439,11059040,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,11059040,11065279,here are your tops bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,11065279,11070560,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,11070560,11077040,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,11077040,11083120,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,11083120,11089120,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,11089120,11096160,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,11096160,11102640,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,11102640,11108720,bads of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,11108720,11114720,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,11114720,11120640,my bed with this  choose the flies away  and if they wake me up i'll throw you
Oo91hfKtl60,11120640,11127520,out and you will not get any turnips  the poor bear sighed put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,11127520,11133279,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,11133279,11139279,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,11139279,11144840,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,11144840,11150880,turnips  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,11150880,11156399,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,11156399,11162319,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,11162319,11168560,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,11168560,11175200,he will wake up  so he raised the fly's watcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,11175200,11180880,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,11180880,11187920,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,11187920,11195840,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,11195840,11200880,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,11200880,11207040,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,11207040,11224880,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,11665120,11670370,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,11671120,11676239,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,11676239,11682800,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,11682800,11688560,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,11688560,11693600,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,11693600,11699920,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,11699920,11707040,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,11707040,11712479,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,11712479,11718319,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,11718319,11723920,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,11723920,11728960,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,11728960,11736160,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,11736160,11742800,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,11742800,11748000,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,11748000,11753120,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,11753120,11759520,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,11759520,11765040,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,11765040,11771520,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,11771520,11778160,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old  mane
Oo91hfKtl60,11778160,11784479,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,11784479,11791920,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,11791920,11797520,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,11797520,11803359,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,11803359,11809760,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,11809760,11817359,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,11817359,11822720,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,11822720,11829920,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,11829920,11836319,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,11836319,11842160,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,11842160,11847600,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,11847600,11854880,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,11854880,11861760,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,11861760,11867439,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,11867439,11872560,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,11872560,11878319,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,11878319,11885760,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,11885760,11894560,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,11894560,11902319,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,11902319,11907600,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,11907600,11912880,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,11912880,11919840,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,11919840,11925120,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,11925120,11931680,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,11931680,11937120,princess straightened out her crown curt  seed and said i probably have bruises
Oo91hfKtl60,11937120,11943279,all over my body because i slept on all  those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,11943279,11948479,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride
Oo91hfKtl60,11948479,11953680,that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,11953680,11958800,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very

Oo91hfKtl60,12357770,12361549,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,12364350,12369840,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,12369840,12376720,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,12376720,12383200,not going the way it dude  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,12383200,12390239,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,12390239,12397120,fourth nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,12397120,12402960,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,12402960,12408319,waiting for christmas to  come so he citrus rife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,12408319,12414800,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,12414800,12420880,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,12420880,12426319,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,12426319,12433680,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,12433680,12440800,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,12440800,12446239,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,12446239,12453520,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,12453520,12459439,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,12459439,12465359,what do you think you're doing this  startled the fox who almost died of fret
Oo91hfKtl60,12465359,12471680,and grabbed her chest but it was only  the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,12471680,12479359,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,12479359,12486560,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,12486560,12493760,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,12493760,12501200,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,12501200,12506319,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,12506319,12512960,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,12512960,12519600,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,12519600,12526080,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,12526080,12531680,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,12531680,12539200,into it  and then saying the christmas tree grew  in the pony grew all told and green
Oo91hfKtl60,12539200,12545279,the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water  just like the humans they even had a
Oo91hfKtl60,12545279,12551680,cake but what they didn't have was a  christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow
Oo91hfKtl60,12551680,12559520,bigger in the water and started to look  like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,12559520,12566720,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,12566720,12572840,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,12572840,12577920,celebrate and the fish became happy too  and started dancing around their
Oo91hfKtl60,12577920,12584880,decorated christmas tale it's time to  take the catch out the wolf decided to  pull his tail out he pulled once nothing
Oo91hfKtl60,12584880,12591439,happened he pulled again but the tail  wouldn't butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,12591439,12598080,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,12598080,12603680,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,12603680,12609040,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,12609040,12616160,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,12616160,12622399,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,12622399,12628399,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,12628399,12636399,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,12636399,12642399,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog that i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,12642399,12649040,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,12649120,12654800,of course there were no fish on the  trail just a bunch of christmas  decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,12654800,12659920,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,13456960,13462880,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,13462880,13469439,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,13469439,13474640,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,13474640,13479760,the bear saw the farmer read his car  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,13479760,13485120,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,13485120,13492319,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,13492319,13498319,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,13498319,13505040,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,13505040,13511279,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,13511279,13517439,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,13517439,13523439,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,13523439,13529439,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,13529439,13535279,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,13535279,13543680,we have a deal  i will give you the top  have to earn your meal so here's the pow
Oo91hfKtl60,13543680,13549920,let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected  that he'd be asked to plow the field
Oo91hfKtl60,13549920,13556000,like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,13556000,13562960,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,13562960,13569120,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,13569120,13575199,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,13575199,13581439,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,13581439,13588640,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,13588640,13596239,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,13596239,13602479,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,13602479,13607840,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,13607840,13614239,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,13614239,13620319,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,13620319,13626399,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,13626399,13633359,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,13633359,13639840,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,13639840,13645920,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,13645920,13651920,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,13651920,13658720,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,13658720,13664720,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,13664720,13670479,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,13670479,13676479,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,13676479,13681840,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,13681840,13688080,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,13688080,13693600,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,13693600,13699520,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,13699520,13705760,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,13705760,13712399,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,13712399,13718080,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,13718080,13725120,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,13725120,13733040,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,13733040,13738080,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,13738080,13744239,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,13744239,13757770,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,14208319,14214560,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now  i'm protecting the vegetable garden from
Oo91hfKtl60,14214560,14220080,all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,14220080,14225760,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,14225760,14230800,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,14230800,14237120,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,14237120,14244239,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,14244239,14249680,were tears in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,14249680,14255520,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,14255520,14261120,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,14261120,14266160,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,14266160,14273359,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,14273359,14280000,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,14280000,14285199,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,14285199,14290319,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,14290319,14296800,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,14296800,14302239,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,14302239,14308720,market when he got tired and lay down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,14308720,14315359,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,14315359,14321680,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,14321680,14329120,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,14329120,14334720,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,14334720,14340560,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,14340560,14346960,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,14346960,14354560,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,14354560,14359920,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,14359920,14367120,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,14367120,14373520,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,14373520,14379359,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,14379359,14384880,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,14384880,14392080,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,14392080,14398960,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,14398960,14404720,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,14404720,14409760,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,14409760,14415520,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,14415520,14422960,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,14422960,14431760,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,14431760,14439520,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,14439520,14444800,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,14444800,14450080,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,14450080,14457040,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid

Oo91hfKtl60,14901550,14907040,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,14907040,14913920,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,14913920,14920399,not going the way it dude  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,14920399,14927439,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,14927439,14934319,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,14934319,14940159,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,14940159,14945520,waiting for christmas to come  so he said just right i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,14945520,14952080,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,14952080,14958080,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,14958080,14963520,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,14963520,14970880,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,14970880,14978000,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,14978000,14983439,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off it wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,14983439,14990800,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,14990800,14996640,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,14996640,15002080,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,15002080,15008960,french and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,15008960,15016560,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,15016560,15023680,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,15023680,15030960,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,15030960,15038399,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,15038399,15043600,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,15043600,15050840,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,15050840,15056800,wolf why do you come to me with your  problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,15056800,15063279,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,15063279,15068880,so the wolf left  empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,15068880,15074560,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,15074560,15082159,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water just like the humans they even
Oo91hfKtl60,15082159,15088880,had a cake but what they didn't have was  a christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow
Oo91hfKtl60,15088880,15096720,bigger in the water and started to look  like a christmas tree only was grey and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,15096720,15103920,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,15103920,15111359,he became happy and sang even louder we  christmas tree and start to celebrate
Oo91hfKtl60,15111359,15118159,and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated  christmas tale it's time to take the
Oo91hfKtl60,15118159,15124640,catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened  he pulled again but the tail wouldn't
Oo91hfKtl60,15124640,15130560,butch  that's when the wolf started spanning  someone help me
Oo91hfKtl60,15130560,15137840,my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to  the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was
Oo91hfKtl60,15137840,15143199,singing the water froze solid  then his tail got stuck in the ice the
Oo91hfKtl60,15143199,15148560,fox heard the wolf screaming and thought  did he really catch the fish now he will
Oo91hfKtl60,15148560,15155279,eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and  ran to the wolf
Oo91hfKtl60,15155279,15161840,together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it  okay fox said the wolf go get the
Oo91hfKtl60,15161840,15167920,fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the  fisherman grabbed the fox the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,15167920,15173600,grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,15173600,15179600,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog that i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,15179600,15186319,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,15186319,15192080,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,15192080,15197120,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,15994159,16000080,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,16000080,16006640,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,16006640,16011840,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,16011840,16016960,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,16016960,16022319,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,16022319,16029600,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,16029600,16035520,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,16035520,16042239,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,16042239,16048479,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,16048479,16054640,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,16054640,16060640,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,16060640,16066640,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh  they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,16066640,16072479,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,16072479,16079760,we have a deal i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,16079760,16085439,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,16085439,16093199,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,16093199,16100159,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,16100159,16106479,anyway they found the fields planted the  seeds and then boom they got lots and
Oo91hfKtl60,16106479,16112399,lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,16112399,16118720,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,16118720,16125840,then the farmer came over and started to  revive the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,16125840,16133520,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,16133520,16139680,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,16139680,16145040,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,16145040,16151439,a farmer looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,16151439,16157520,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,16157520,16163600,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,16163600,16170640,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,16170640,16177040,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,16177040,16183199,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry

Oo91hfKtl60,16196000,16201920,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,16201920,16207760,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,16207760,16213760,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,16213760,16219040,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,16219040,16225359,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,16225359,16230880,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,16230880,16236720,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,16236720,16243040,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,16243040,16249600,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,16249600,16255279,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose a
Oo91hfKtl60,16255279,16262319,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,16262319,16270239,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,16270239,16275279,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,16275279,16282399,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end

Oo91hfKtl60,16745520,16750639,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,16750639,16757279,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,16757279,16762959,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,16762959,16768000,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,16768000,16774400,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,16774400,16781440,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,16781440,16786878,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,16786878,16792718,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,16792718,16798320,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,16798320,16803360,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,16803360,16810400,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it
Oo91hfKtl60,16810400,16817200,she thought very hard and very long and  then she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,16817200,16822400,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,16822400,16827520,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,16827520,16834000,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,16834000,16841040,headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was  halfway to the market when he got tired
Oo91hfKtl60,16841040,16848560,and lay down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt  something poking at his side
Oo91hfKtl60,16848560,16855040,he opened his eyes and saw an old mane  jack was very surprised and the old man
Oo91hfKtl60,16855040,16861200,told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your cat will
Oo91hfKtl60,16861200,16866400,give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,16866400,16872240,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell a spot a cow so
Oo91hfKtl60,16872240,16877760,without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,16877760,16884160,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,16884160,16891760,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,16891760,16897120,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,16897120,16904400,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,16904400,16910718,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,16910718,16916560,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,16916560,16922080,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,16922080,16929360,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,16929360,16936160,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,16936160,16942560,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,16942560,16947920,tree was so big and tall that its top  reached all the way to the clouds high
Oo91hfKtl60,16947920,16955600,up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds  he was curious to know who could be up
Oo91hfKtl60,16955600,16961440,there singing the song so jack started  to climb up the bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,16961440,16968958,he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,16968958,16976798,hey you up there  shadow jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,16976798,16982000,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,16982000,16987280,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,16987280,16994240,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,16994240,16999600,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,16999600,17006160,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,17006160,17013520,princess straightened out her crown  curtseyed and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,17013520,17020878,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,17020878,17028080,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,17432200,17435968,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,17438770,17444240,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,17444240,17451120,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,17451120,17457600,not going the way it dude  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,17457600,17464638,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,17464638,17471520,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,17471520,17477360,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,17477360,17484160,waiting for christmas to come  so he citrus rife i'm going fishing dear
Oo91hfKtl60,17484160,17489280,the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,17489280,17495280,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,17495280,17500718,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,17500718,17508080,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,17508080,17515200,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,17515200,17520718,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,17520718,17528000,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,17528000,17533840,sleigh on the sly suddenly someone came  up and screamed behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,17533840,17539360,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost had a
Oo91hfKtl60,17539360,17546160,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,17546160,17553760,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,17553760,17560958,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,17560958,17568160,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,17568160,17575600,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,17575600,17580798,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,17580798,17587360,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,17587360,17594000,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,17594000,17600480,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,17600480,17606160,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,17606160,17611760,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,17611760,17617200,all told  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,17617200,17622240,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,17622240,17628480,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,17628480,17633600,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling
Oo91hfKtl60,17633600,17638798,so the fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something
Oo91hfKtl60,17638798,17643840,sticking to his tail under the water so  he became happy and sang even louder we
Oo91hfKtl60,17643840,17650718,decorate the christmas tree and start to  celebrate  and the fish became happy too and
Oo91hfKtl60,17650718,17657440,started dancing around their decorated  christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his
Oo91hfKtl60,17657440,17662798,tail out he pulled once nothing happened  he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch
Oo91hfKtl60,17662798,17670400,that's when the wolf started spanning  someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull
Oo91hfKtl60,17670400,17678080,it out you know what really happened to  the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,17678080,17683520,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,17683520,17690560,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,17690560,17696798,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,17696798,17702798,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,17702798,17710798,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,17710798,17716878,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog then i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,17716878,17723520,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,17723520,17729280,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,17729280,17734400,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,17734400,17742810,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  tasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,18531600,18537520,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,18537520,18544080,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,18544080,18549280,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,18549280,18554400,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,18554400,18561520,jumped down and started digging  something up with a shovel the bear  wanted to find out what was going on but
Oo91hfKtl60,18561520,18566958,he pushed the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,18566958,18572958,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,18572958,18579680,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,18579680,18585920,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,18585920,18592080,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,18592080,18598000,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,18598000,18604080,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,18604080,18609920,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,18609920,18616240,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal
Oo91hfKtl60,18616240,18622798,so here's the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,18622798,18630638,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,18630638,18637600,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,18637600,18642958,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,18642958,18650240,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house where he
Oo91hfKtl60,18650240,18656080,threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,18656080,18663280,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,18663280,18670878,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,18670878,18677120,here are your tops bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,18677120,18682400,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,18682400,18688878,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,18688878,18694958,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,18694958,18700958,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,18700958,18708000,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,18708000,18714480,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,18714480,18720560,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,18720560,18726560,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,18726560,18733360,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,18733360,18739360,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,18739360,18745120,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,18745120,18751120,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,18751120,18756480,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,18756480,18762718,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,18762718,18768240,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,18768240,18774160,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,18774160,18780400,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,18780400,18787040,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,18787040,18792718,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,18792718,18799760,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,18799760,18807600,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,18807600,18812718,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,18812718,18818878,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,18818878,18832400,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,19300320,19305440,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,19305440,19311760,spent all day long digging in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,19311760,19318878,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,19318878,19324320,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,19324320,19330160,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,19330160,19335680,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,19335680,19340798,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,19340798,19348000,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,19348000,19354638,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,19354638,19359840,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,19359840,19364958,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,19364958,19371360,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,19371360,19376878,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,19376878,19383360,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,19383360,19390000,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,19390000,19396320,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,19396320,19403760,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,19403760,19409360,want to walk for miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell a spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,19409360,19415200,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,19415200,19421600,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,19421600,19429200,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,19429200,19434558,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,19434558,19441760,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,19441760,19448320,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green the
Oo91hfKtl60,19448320,19454320,widow just threw her hands in the air  and said oh what a simpleton you are my
Oo91hfKtl60,19454320,19459440,son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,19459440,19466718,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,19466718,19473600,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,19473600,19479280,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,19479280,19484400,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,19484400,19492240,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds he was curious to know who
Oo91hfKtl60,19492240,19498878,could be up there singing the song so  jack started to climb up the bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,19498878,19506400,he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,19506400,19514160,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,19514160,19519440,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,19519440,19524718,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,19524718,19531680,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,19531680,19536718,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  goodie yank and a beautiful princess
Oo91hfKtl60,19536718,19543520,fell down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,19543520,19548958,princess straightened out her crown curt  seed and said i probably have bruises
Oo91hfKtl60,19548958,19555200,all over my body because i slept on all  those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,19555200,19560958,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride that's how it
Oo91hfKtl60,19560958,19566958,came to be that jack got married became  a king and got half a kingdom too
Oo91hfKtl60,19566958,19572638,that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very  interesting in my vegetable patch too

Oo91hfKtl60,19976180,19982798,[Music]  miracles some people think that  decorating a christmas tree for the
Oo91hfKtl60,19982798,19988558,holidays is a piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,19988558,19995040,not going the way it should  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,19995040,20002080,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,20002080,20008958,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,20008958,20014798,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,20014798,20020160,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,20020160,20026638,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,20026638,20032718,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,20032718,20038160,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,20038160,20045520,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,20045520,20052958,up the man's favorite spot the fishermen  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,20052958,20058480,there for a long time and even started  to doze off he wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,20058480,20065360,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,20065360,20071280,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,20071280,20076718,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,20076718,20083520,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,20083520,20091200,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,20091200,20098400,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,20098400,20105600,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,20105600,20113040,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,20113040,20118160,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,20118160,20124798,then catch fish for yourself  whispered the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,20124798,20131440,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,20131440,20137920,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,20137920,20143520,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,20143520,20151040,into it  and then sang the christmas tree grew in  the pawnee grew up told lundgren
Oo91hfKtl60,20151040,20157120,the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water  just like the humans they even had a
Oo91hfKtl60,20157120,20163520,cake but what they didn't have was a  christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow
Oo91hfKtl60,20163520,20171280,bigger in the water and started to look  like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,20171280,20178558,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,20178558,20184160,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,20184160,20190400,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,20190400,20197360,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,20197360,20203280,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,20203280,20209920,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,20209920,20215520,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,20215520,20220878,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,20220878,20228000,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,20228000,20234160,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,20234160,20240240,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,20240240,20248240,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,20248240,20254240,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog the dog called the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,20254240,20260958,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,20260958,20266638,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,20266638,20271760,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,21074718,21081280,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,21081280,21086480,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,21086480,21091600,the bear saw the final red his car over  to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,21091600,21096958,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,21096958,21104240,out what was going on but he pushed the  farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,21104240,21110160,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,21110160,21116878,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,21116878,21123120,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,21123120,21129280,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,21129280,21135280,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,21135280,21141280,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,21141280,21147120,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,21147120,21154400,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,21154400,21160080,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,21160080,21167840,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,21167840,21174798,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,21174798,21180958,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,21180958,21187040,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,21187040,21193280,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,21193280,21198958,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop he took all the
Oo91hfKtl60,21198958,21205280,turnips for himself and told the bear  these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that
Oo91hfKtl60,21205280,21212080,were not tasty at all and said all right  here are your tops bun up a tea bear the
Oo91hfKtl60,21212080,21219680,bear tasted them and said ew this tastes  horrible these tops are not edible  farmer why did you give them to me
Oo91hfKtl60,21219680,21226878,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you the bear looked
Oo91hfKtl60,21226878,21233360,back at the farmer speechless he just  stood there with his jaw dropped and you  could hear his stomach making hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,21233360,21240240,noises  the poor bear he was really hungry  so he walked up to the farmer and asked
Oo91hfKtl60,21240240,21248000,can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll  give you some turnips but first you have
Oo91hfKtl60,21248000,21254480,to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big  bads of beans wash all the dirty dishes
Oo91hfKtl60,21254480,21261120,clean the whole house do all the laundry  and  what else oh yeah
Oo91hfKtl60,21261120,21268878,i will go to sleep and you will stand by  my bed with this  two supplies away and if they wake me up
Oo91hfKtl60,21268878,21276558,i'll throw you out and you will not get  any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,21276558,21282400,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,21282400,21288320,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,21288320,21293680,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,21293680,21300000,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,21300000,21305440,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,21305440,21311360,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,21311360,21317680,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,21317680,21324798,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might the bear was
Oo91hfKtl60,21324798,21330400,trying to hit the fly but he hit the  farmer right on the nose the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,21330400,21336958,jumped up holding his nose and screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,21336958,21344878,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,21344878,21349920,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,21349920,21357040,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,21357040,21373920,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,21825280,21831920,vegetable garden from all the pests okay  never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,21831920,21837600,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,21837600,21842638,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,21842638,21848958,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,21848958,21856080,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as they
Oo91hfKtl60,21856080,21861520,were tears in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,21861520,21867360,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,21867360,21872958,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,21872958,21878000,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,21878000,21885280,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,21885280,21891840,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,21891840,21897040,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,21897040,21902160,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,21902160,21908638,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,21908638,21915680,headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was  halfway to the market when he got tired
Oo91hfKtl60,21915680,21923200,and laid down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt  something poking at his side
Oo91hfKtl60,21923200,21929600,he opened his eyes and saw an old man  jack was very surprised and the old man
Oo91hfKtl60,21929600,21935840,told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your cow will
Oo91hfKtl60,21935840,21940958,give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,21940958,21946558,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,21946558,21952400,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,21952400,21958798,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,21958798,21966400,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,21966400,21971760,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,21971760,21978958,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,21978958,21985360,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,21985360,21991200,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,21991200,21996718,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,21996718,22003920,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,22003920,22010798,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,22010798,22016558,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,22016558,22021600,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,22021600,22027360,clouds high up in the sky jack could  hear a song coming down from the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,22027360,22034798,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,22034798,22043600,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,22043600,22051360,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,22051360,22056638,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,22056638,22061920,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,22061920,22068878,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,22068878,22074240,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,22074240,22080718,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,22080718,22086160,princess straightened out her crown curt  seed and said i probably have bruises
Oo91hfKtl60,22086160,22092400,all over my body because i slept on all  those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,22092400,22097520,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride
Oo91hfKtl60,22097520,22102718,that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,22102718,22107840,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you  maybe i will grow something very
Oo91hfKtl60,22107840,22115200,interesting in my vegetable patch too  just like jack but i have to make sure  no pets get into my beautiful garden

Oo91hfKtl60,22506830,22510600,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,22513400,22518878,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,22518878,22525760,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,22525760,22532240,not going the way it should do you know  what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,22532240,22539280,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,22539280,22546160,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,22546160,22552000,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,22552000,22558798,waiting for christmas to come  so he citrus rife i'm going fishing dear
Oo91hfKtl60,22558798,22563920,the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,22563920,22569920,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,22569920,22575360,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,22575360,22582718,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,22582718,22589840,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,22589840,22595280,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,22595280,22602638,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,22602638,22608480,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,22608480,22613920,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,22613920,22620798,french and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,22620798,22628400,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,22628400,22635600,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,22635600,22642798,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,22642798,22650240,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,22650240,22655440,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,22655440,22662000,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,22662000,22668638,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,22668638,22675120,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,22675120,22680718,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,22680718,22686400,into it and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,22686400,22691840,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,22691840,22696878,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,22696878,22703120,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,22703120,22708558,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,22708558,22715760,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,22715760,22721440,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,22721440,22727600,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,22727600,22734558,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,22734558,22740478,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,22740478,22747120,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,22747120,22752718,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,22752718,22758080,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,22758080,22765200,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,22765200,22771440,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,22771440,22777440,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,22777440,22782638,fishermen grab the fox the fox grabbed  the wolf the wolf grabbed his tail but
Oo91hfKtl60,22782638,22789600,they couldn't pull it out  the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog they'd all call the cat
Oo91hfKtl60,22789600,22795600,the cat called the mouse  all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of
Oo91hfKtl60,22795600,22800718,the water  of course there were no fish on the trip
Oo91hfKtl60,22800718,22807120,just a bunch of christmas decorations  and that moment the fireworks started
Oo91hfKtl60,22807120,22814000,that's what i'm telling you during the  holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than

Oo91hfKtl60,23607440,23613920,is caring but we're not talking about me  here so i'd better tell you a fairy tale
Oo91hfKtl60,23613920,23620958,there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was  the forest with all sorts of creatures
Oo91hfKtl60,23620958,23628958,living in it including the bear one day  the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,23628958,23634240,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,23634240,23641520,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,23641520,23647440,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,23647440,23654160,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,23654160,23660478,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,23660478,23666638,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,23666638,23672558,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,23672558,23678558,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh  they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,23678558,23684400,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,23684400,23691680,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,23691680,23697360,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,23697360,23705120,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,23705120,23712080,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,23712080,23718320,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,23718320,23724320,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,23724320,23730638,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,23730638,23737760,then the farmer came over  and started to revive the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,23737760,23745440,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,23745440,23751600,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,23751600,23756958,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,23756958,23763360,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised  but you asked for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,23763360,23769440,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,23769440,23775520,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,23775520,23782558,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,23782558,23788958,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,23788958,23795120,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,23795120,23801040,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,23801040,23807680,my bed with this  cheese the flies away and if they wake  me up i'll throw you out and you will
Oo91hfKtl60,23807680,23813840,not get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,23813840,23819680,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,23819680,23825680,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,23825680,23830958,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,23830958,23837280,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,23837280,23842798,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,23842798,23848638,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,23848638,23854958,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,23854958,23861520,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,23861520,23867280,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,23867280,23874240,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,23874240,23882160,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,23882160,23887200,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,23887200,23894320,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,23894320,23909580,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,24351460,24356720,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,24357520,24362558,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,24362558,24369200,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,24369200,24374878,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,24374878,24379920,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,24379920,24386320,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,24386320,24393360,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,24393360,24398798,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,24398798,24404638,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,24404638,24410240,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,24410240,24415280,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,24415280,24422320,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it
Oo91hfKtl60,24422320,24429120,she thought very hard and very long and  then she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,24429120,24434400,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,24434400,24439440,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,24439440,24444718,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit so jack put a leash
Oo91hfKtl60,24444718,24450718,on the cow and headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was
Oo91hfKtl60,24450718,24457840,halfway to the market when he got tired  and laid down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,24457840,24464478,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,24464478,24470798,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,24470798,24475840,yours and in exchange for your cat will  give you a nice little bean
Oo91hfKtl60,24475840,24480958,to tell you the truth jack really didn't  want to walk from miles and miles to the
Oo91hfKtl60,24480958,24486958,marketplace to sell a spot a cow  so without further ado he agreed to this
Oo91hfKtl60,24486958,24494478,deal jack and the old man shook hands  the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed
Oo91hfKtl60,24494478,24501040,for home  when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit
Oo91hfKtl60,24501040,24507360,she got very very scared she thought  he'd been robbed by the highwayman but
Oo91hfKtl60,24507360,24513680,jack told her  don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for
Oo91hfKtl60,24513680,24520240,your old spotted cow i got a brand new  little bean and i have never seen a
Oo91hfKtl60,24520240,24528478,nicer shade of green  the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,24528478,24534000,my son then she grabbed the bean and  threw it out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,24534000,24541280,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,24541280,24548080,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,24548080,24553840,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,24553840,24558958,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,24558958,24564718,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,24564718,24570478,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,24570478,24576958,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,24576958,24582160,should he give it another try why bother  hey you
Oo91hfKtl60,24582160,24588718,up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,24588718,24593920,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,24593920,24599200,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,24599200,24606160,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,24606160,24611520,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,24611520,24618080,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,24618080,24625440,princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,24625440,24632798,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,24632798,24640000,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,25044130,25047900,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,25050700,25056160,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,25056160,25063040,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,25063040,25069520,not going the way it dude  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,25069520,25076558,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,25076558,25083440,force nearby i lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,25083440,25089280,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,25089280,25094638,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,25094638,25101200,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,25101200,25107200,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,25107200,25112638,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,25112638,25120080,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,25120080,25127120,up the moon's favorite spot the  fisherman sat on the ice by the opening  and started fishing up there he was
Oo91hfKtl60,25127120,25132638,sitting there for a long time and even  started to doze off he wasn't having any
Oo91hfKtl60,25132638,25139920,luck catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,25139920,25146558,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,25146558,25153680,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  french and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,25153680,25160400,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,25160400,25165680,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,25165680,25172878,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,25172878,25180080,no the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,25180080,25187520,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,25187520,25192718,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,25192718,25199360,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,25199360,25206000,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,25206000,25212400,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,25212400,25218080,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,25218080,25223680,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,25223680,25229120,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,25229120,25234160,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,25234160,25240400,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,25240400,25245520,like a christmas tree only was great and  upside down and on the ceiling
Oo91hfKtl60,25245520,25250718,so the fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something
Oo91hfKtl60,25250718,25255760,sticking to his tail under the water so  he became happy and sang even louder we
Oo91hfKtl60,25255760,25262638,decorate the christmas tree and start to  celebrate  and the fish became happy too and
Oo91hfKtl60,25262638,25269360,started dancing around their decorated  christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his
Oo91hfKtl60,25269360,25274718,tail out he pulled once nothing happened  he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch
Oo91hfKtl60,25274718,25282320,that's when the wolf started spanning  someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull
Oo91hfKtl60,25282320,25290000,it out you know what really happened to  the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,25290000,25295440,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,25295440,25302478,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,25302478,25308718,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,25308718,25314718,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,25314718,25322718,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,25322718,25328798,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog that i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,25328798,25335440,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,25335440,25341200,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,25341200,25346320,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,25346320,25354740,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  tasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,26143360,26149360,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,26149360,26155920,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,26155920,26161040,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,26161040,26166240,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,26166240,26171520,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,26171520,26178798,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,26178798,26184718,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,26184718,26191520,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,26191520,26197760,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,26197760,26203920,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,26203920,26210080,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots why
Oo91hfKtl60,26210080,26215840,would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,26215840,26221760,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,26221760,26228958,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,26228958,26234638,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,26234638,26242398,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,26242398,26249360,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,26249360,26255600,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,26255600,26261600,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,26261600,26267920,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,26267920,26275040,then the farmer came over and started to  revive the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,26275040,26282718,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,26282718,26288878,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,26288878,26296000,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me a farmer looked at the bear and
Oo91hfKtl60,26296000,26302478,pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you  the bear looked back at the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,26302478,26309040,speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his  stomach making hungry noises
Oo91hfKtl60,26309040,26314798,the poor bear he was really hungry  so he walked up to the farmer and asked
Oo91hfKtl60,26314798,26319840,can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,26319840,26326240,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,26326240,26332398,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,26332398,26338398,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,26338398,26345200,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,26345200,26351120,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,26351120,26356958,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,26356958,26362958,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,26362958,26368320,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,26368320,26374558,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,26374558,26380080,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,26380080,26385920,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,26385920,26392718,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now he will
Oo91hfKtl60,26392718,26398878,wake up  so he raised the flies watch her and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,26398878,26404558,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,26404558,26411600,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,26411600,26419440,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,26419440,26424558,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,26424558,26431600,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,26431600,26446870,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,26895040,26902638,my little toy friends i can't play with  you right now i'm protecting the  vegetable garden from all the pests
Oo91hfKtl60,26902638,26908840,okay never mind i wouldn't want you to  get bored  so let me tell you a fairy
Oo91hfKtl60,26908840,26914080,tale jack and the beanstalk there was a  poor widow who lived in a village and
Oo91hfKtl60,26914080,26919360,she had a son named jack the widow and  her son spent all day long taking in
Oo91hfKtl60,26919360,26924558,their vegetable garden whatever grew in  that vegetable garden that was what they
Oo91hfKtl60,26924558,26931600,ate then the time came for jack to get  married there was as many maids in the  village as there were carrots in the
Oo91hfKtl60,26931600,26938958,patches only all of them turned jack  down  it's no wonder they refused to marry him
Oo91hfKtl60,26938958,26944878,who would have wanted a groom like that  his pants were torn and had patches his
Oo91hfKtl60,26944878,26950080,shoes had holes into the soles and his  hat was as flat as a pancake
Oo91hfKtl60,26950080,26955280,no one would marry him no one would even  go out with poor jack the widow knew he
Oo91hfKtl60,26955280,26962478,needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she  thought very hard and very long and then
Oo91hfKtl60,26962478,26969200,she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get  married you need to look presentable
Oo91hfKtl60,26969200,26974398,i've thought long and hard about this  and there's nothing left to do but to
Oo91hfKtl60,26974398,26982000,sell our spotted cow  with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit so jack put a leash
Oo91hfKtl60,26982000,26988000,on the cow and headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was
Oo91hfKtl60,26988000,26995200,halfway to the market when he got tired  and laid down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,26995200,27001760,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,27001760,27008080,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,27008080,27013120,yours and in exchange for your account  will give you a nice little bean
Oo91hfKtl60,27013120,27018240,to tell you the truth jack really didn't  want to walk from miles and miles to the
Oo91hfKtl60,27018240,27024240,marketplace to sell a spot a cow  so without further ado he agreed to this
Oo91hfKtl60,27024240,27031760,deal jack and the old man shook hands  the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed
Oo91hfKtl60,27031760,27038320,for home  when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit
Oo91hfKtl60,27038320,27046958,she got very very scared  she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her don't you
Oo91hfKtl60,27046958,27053600,worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,27053600,27060000,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,27060000,27065760,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,27065760,27071280,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,27071280,27078558,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  she yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,27078558,27085440,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,27085440,27091120,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,27091120,27096240,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,27096240,27102000,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,27102000,27107840,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,27107840,27114240,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice

Oo91hfKtl60,27587990,27593440,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,27593440,27600320,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,27600320,27606878,not going the way it chewed  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,27606878,27613920,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,27613920,27620718,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,27620718,27626558,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,27626558,27631920,waiting for christmas to come  so he said just wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,27631920,27638478,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,27638478,27644478,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,27644478,27650000,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,27650000,27657360,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,27657360,27664798,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,27664798,27670320,there for a long time and even started  to doze off it wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,27670320,27677200,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,27677200,27683040,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,27683040,27688558,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,27688558,27695360,french and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,27695360,27703040,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,27703040,27710160,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,27710160,27717440,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,27717440,27722638,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you the wolf got
Oo91hfKtl60,27722638,27730000,really sad  where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,27730000,27736638,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,27736638,27743280,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,27743280,27749680,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,27749680,27755360,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,27755360,27760958,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,27760958,27766398,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,27766398,27771440,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,27771440,27777680,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,27777680,27782798,like a christmas tree only was grey and  upside down and on the ceiling
Oo91hfKtl60,27782798,27788080,so the fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something
Oo91hfKtl60,27788080,27796000,sticking to his tail under the water so  he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,27796000,27802160,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,27802160,27809200,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,27809200,27815040,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,27815040,27821760,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,27821760,27827280,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,27827280,27832718,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,27832718,27839840,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,27839840,27846000,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,27846000,27852080,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,27852080,27860000,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,27860000,27866080,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog then i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,27866080,27872718,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,27872718,27878478,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,27878478,27883600,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,27883600,27892030,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  tasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,28669280,28677040,masha's tails  gold children always share everything  with others and do it the right way i
Oo91hfKtl60,28677040,28683440,like to do my share of oh sharing  i know sharing is caring but we're not
Oo91hfKtl60,28683440,28690558,talking about me here so i'd better tell  you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village
Oo91hfKtl60,28690558,28698240,the tops and the roots and nearby was  the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,28698240,28703440,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,28703440,28708798,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,28708798,28716320,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here well
Oo91hfKtl60,28716320,28722000,bear i need to plow the field plant the  seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,28722000,28728718,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,28728718,28734958,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,28734958,28741120,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,28741120,28747040,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,28747040,28753120,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,28753120,28758958,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,28758958,28765280,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal
Oo91hfKtl60,28765280,28771840,so here's the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,28771840,28779600,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,28779600,28786638,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,28786638,28792798,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,28792798,28798798,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,28798798,28805120,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,28805120,28812240,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,28812240,28819920,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,28819920,28826080,here are your tops  bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,28826080,28831440,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,28831440,28837840,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,28837840,28844000,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,28844000,28850000,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,28850000,28857040,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,28857040,28863440,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,28863440,28869520,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,28869520,28875600,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,28875600,28882240,my bed with this  choose the flies away and if they wake  me up i'll throw you out and you will
Oo91hfKtl60,28882240,28888320,not get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,28888320,28894160,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,28894160,28900160,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,28900160,28905520,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,28905520,28911680,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,28911680,28917280,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,28917280,28923200,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,28923200,28929440,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,28929440,28936080,he will wake up  so he raised the flies to watch her and  hit the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,28936080,28941760,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,28941760,28948798,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,28948798,28954398,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips
Oo91hfKtl60,28954398,28961760,grabbed the bags and ran off with them  into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,28961760,28968878,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,28968878,28984088,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,29432000,29437040,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,29437040,29443680,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,29443680,29449360,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,29449360,29454478,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,29454478,29459520,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden whatever grew in that
Oo91hfKtl60,29459520,29466718,vegetable garden that was what they ate  then the time came for jack to get  married there was as many maids in the
Oo91hfKtl60,29466718,29473360,village as there were carrots in the  patches only all of them turned jack  down
Oo91hfKtl60,29473360,29479200,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,29479200,29484798,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,29484798,29489840,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,29489840,29497040,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,29497040,29503680,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,29503680,29508878,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,29508878,29515120,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow with the money you
Oo91hfKtl60,29515120,29520398,get you can buy yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,29520398,29525920,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,29525920,29532398,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,29532398,29538958,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,29538958,29545280,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy let me buy this spotted cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,29545280,29550320,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean
Oo91hfKtl60,29550320,29555520,to tell you the truth jack really didn't  want to walk from miles and miles to the
Oo91hfKtl60,29555520,29561440,marketplace to sell a spot a cow  so without further ado he agreed to this
Oo91hfKtl60,29561440,29568958,deal jack and the old man shook hands  the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed
Oo91hfKtl60,29568958,29575520,for home  when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit
Oo91hfKtl60,29575520,29584160,she got very very scared  she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her don't you
Oo91hfKtl60,29584160,29590798,worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,29590798,29597200,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,29597200,29603040,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,29603040,29608478,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,29608478,29615760,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,29615760,29622638,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,29622638,29628320,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,29628320,29633440,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,29633440,29639200,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,29639200,29645040,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,29645040,29651440,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,29651440,29656638,should he give it another try why bother  hey you
Oo91hfKtl60,29656638,29663200,up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,29663200,29668398,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,29668398,29673760,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,29673760,29680718,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,29680718,29686000,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,29686000,29692398,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid
Oo91hfKtl60,29692398,29699200,the princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said  i probably have bruises all over my body
Oo91hfKtl60,29699200,29707360,because i slept on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,29707360,29714478,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,30125200,30130718,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,30130718,30137600,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,30137600,30145040,not going the way it should  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it the wolf and the
Oo91hfKtl60,30145040,30150638,fox  in a village far far away there was a  man a local fisherman and his wife and
Oo91hfKtl60,30150638,30156840,then in the force nearby lived a very  sly wolf who was always sneaking over  and stealing fish from the
Oo91hfKtl60,30156840,30161920,fishermen when it was christmas time the  men decorated the christmas tree but he
Oo91hfKtl60,30161920,30169200,didn't feel like just sitting around  waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,30169200,30175680,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,30175680,30181680,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,30181680,30187200,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,30187200,30194558,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,30194558,30202000,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,30202000,30207520,there for a long time and even started  to doze off he wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,30207520,30214398,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,30214398,30221040,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,30221040,30228160,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  fret and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,30228160,30234878,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,30234878,30240240,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,30240240,30247440,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,30247440,30254638,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,30254638,30262080,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,30262080,30267200,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,30267200,30273840,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,30273840,30280478,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,30280478,30286878,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song  so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,30286878,30292558,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,30292558,30298160,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,30298160,30303600,all told and green the fish were  celebrating christmas in the water
Oo91hfKtl60,30303600,30308718,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,30308718,30314958,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,30314958,30320318,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,30320318,30327600,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,30327600,30333200,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,30333200,30339360,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,30339360,30346398,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,30346398,30352318,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,30352318,30358080,someone help me my towel is all fished  out i can't pull it out you know what
Oo91hfKtl60,30358080,30364478,really happened to the poor wolf's tail  while the wolf was singing the water  froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,30364478,30369920,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,30369920,30377040,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,30377040,30383200,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,30383200,30389280,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,30389280,30397200,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out

Oo91hfKtl60,30403280,30408840,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the
Oo91hfKtl60,30408840,30413920,water of course there were no fish on  the trip just a bunch of christmas

Oo91hfKtl60,31217760,31223760,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,31223760,31230318,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,31230318,31235440,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,31235440,31240638,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,31240638,31246000,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,31246000,31251280,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him hey farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,31251280,31259200,what are you doing here  well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,31259200,31265920,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,31265920,31272160,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,31272160,31278318,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,31278318,31284240,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,31284240,31290318,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,31290318,31296160,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,31296160,31302478,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal
Oo91hfKtl60,31302478,31309040,so here's the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,31309040,31316798,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,31316798,31322558,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow come on my little pony run
Oo91hfKtl60,31322558,31329200,faster  anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,31329200,31336080,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,31336080,31342318,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,31342318,31349440,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,31349440,31357120,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,31357120,31363280,here are your tops  bun up a tea bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,31363280,31368638,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,31368638,31375040,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,31375040,31381120,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,31381120,31387200,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,31387200,31394240,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,31394240,31400718,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant ten roast bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,31400718,31406798,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,31406798,31412798,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,31412798,31417920,my bed with this  two supplies away and if they wake me up
Oo91hfKtl60,31417920,31425520,i'll throw you out and you will not get  any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,31425520,31431360,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,31431360,31437360,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,31437360,31442718,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,31442718,31448958,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,31448958,31454478,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,31454478,31460398,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,31460398,31466638,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,31466638,31473280,he will wake up  so he raised the flies to watch her and  hit the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,31473280,31478798,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose
Oo91hfKtl60,31478798,31486000,the farmer jumped up holding his nose  and screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,31486000,31493840,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,31493840,31498958,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,31498958,31506080,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,31506080,31518622,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,32010558,32016398,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,32016398,32022000,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,32022000,32027040,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,32027040,32034240,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,32034240,32040878,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,32040878,32046080,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,32046080,32051120,and there's nothing left to do  but to sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,32051120,32057600,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,32057600,32063120,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,32063120,32069600,market when he got tired and lay down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,32069600,32074840,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old
Oo91hfKtl60,32074840,32079920,mane jack was very surprised and the old  man told him
Oo91hfKtl60,32079920,32087520,my boy let me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean
Oo91hfKtl60,32087520,32092718,to tell you the truth jack really didn't  want to walk from miles and miles to the
Oo91hfKtl60,32092718,32098638,marketplace to sell his spot a cow  so without further ado he agreed to this
Oo91hfKtl60,32098638,32106160,deal jack and the old man shook hands  the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed
Oo91hfKtl60,32106160,32112718,for home  when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit
Oo91hfKtl60,32112718,32120798,she got very very scared  she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,32120798,32128000,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,32128000,32134398,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,32134398,32140240,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,32140240,32145680,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,32145680,32152958,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,32152958,32159840,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,32159840,32165520,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,32165520,32170638,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,32170638,32176398,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,32176398,32182240,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,32182240,32188638,to climb up the bean tree  he fell down once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,32188638,32193840,should he give it another try why bother  hey you
Oo91hfKtl60,32193840,32200398,up there  shadow jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,32200398,32205600,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,32205600,32210958,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,32210958,32217920,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,32217920,32223200,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,32223200,32229760,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,32229760,32237200,princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,32237200,32244558,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,32244558,32251680,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,32655840,32659600,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,32662410,32667920,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,32667920,32674798,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,32674798,32681280,not going the way it should do you know  what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,32681280,32687840,the wolf and the fox  in a village far far away there was a  man a local fisherman and his wife and
Oo91hfKtl60,32687840,32695120,then in the fourth nearby lived a very  sly wolf who was always sneaking over  and stealing fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,32695120,32700958,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,32700958,32706398,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,32706398,32712878,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,32712878,32718878,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,32718878,32724398,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,32724398,32731760,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,32731760,32739200,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,32739200,32744718,there for a long time and even started  to doze off he wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,32744718,32751600,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,32751600,32758318,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,32758318,32765360,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  fret and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,32765360,32772078,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,32772078,32777438,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,32777438,32784640,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,32784640,32791840,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,32791840,32799278,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,32799278,32804398,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,32804398,32811040,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,32811040,32817680,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,32817680,32824078,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,32824078,32829758,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,32829758,32835360,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,32835360,32840800,all told and green the fish were  celebrating christmas in the water
Oo91hfKtl60,32840800,32845918,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,32845918,32852160,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,32852160,32857520,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,32857520,32864800,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,32864800,32870398,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,32870398,32876558,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,32876558,32883598,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,32883598,32889520,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spawning
Oo91hfKtl60,32889520,32896160,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,32896160,32901680,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,32901680,32907122,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,32907122,32914238,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fisherman and
Oo91hfKtl60,32914238,32919278,ran to the wolf together they tried to  pull the tail out of the water but they
Oo91hfKtl60,32919278,32926480,couldn't do it okay fox said the wolf go  get the fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,32926480,32934398,fishermen grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,32934398,32940480,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog the dog called the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,32940480,32947122,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,32947122,32952878,of course there were no fish on the  trail just a bunch of christmas  decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,32952878,32958000,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the
Oo91hfKtl60,32958000,32966450,holidays you must decorate the christmas  tree properly it's more important than  toasty cakes and sweet candies

Oo91hfKtl60,33755040,33760960,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,33760960,33767520,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,33767520,33772720,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,33772720,33777840,the bear saw the final red his car over  to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,33777840,33783200,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,33783200,33790400,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,33790400,33796400,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,33796400,33803120,what i really  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,33803120,33809360,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,33809360,33815520,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,33815520,33821436,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,33821436,33827520,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,33827520,33833360,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,33833360,33840640,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,33840640,33846240,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,33846240,33854480,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed with the
Oo91hfKtl60,33854480,33861040,farmer hurrying him from behind the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,33861040,33866400,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,33866400,33873276,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,33873276,33879520,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,33879520,33886720,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,33886720,33894320,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,33894320,33900560,here are your tops bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,33900560,33905840,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,33905840,33912320,a fireman looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,33912320,33918400,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,33918400,33924480,stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,33924480,33931436,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,33931436,33937916,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,33937916,33944000,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,33944000,33950000,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,33950000,33955916,my bed with this cheese the flies away  and if they wake me up i'll throw you
Oo91hfKtl60,33955916,33962800,out and you will not get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,33962800,33968560,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,33968560,33974560,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,33974560,33979916,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,33979916,33986160,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,33986160,33991680,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,33991680,33997596,and started crawling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,33997596,34003840,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,34003840,34010480,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,34010480,34016000,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose
Oo91hfKtl60,34016000,34023200,the farmer jumped up holding his nose  and screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,34023200,34031040,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,34031040,34036160,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,34036160,34043276,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,34043276,34058500,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,34506400,34511436,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,34511436,34518080,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,34518080,34523756,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,34523756,34528880,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,34528880,34535200,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,34535200,34542320,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,34542320,34547756,were carrots in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,34547756,34553596,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,34553596,34559200,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,34559200,34564240,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,34564240,34571436,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,34571436,34578080,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,34578080,34583276,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,34583276,34588400,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,34588400,34594800,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,34594800,34601916,headed to the market  but the road was long and tiring he was  halfway to the market when he got tired
Oo91hfKtl60,34601916,34609436,and lay down under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt  something poking at his side
Oo91hfKtl60,34609436,34615840,he opened his eyes and saw an old mane  jack was very surprised and the old man
Oo91hfKtl60,34615840,34622000,told him  my boy let me buy the spotted cow of  yours and in exchange for your cow will
Oo91hfKtl60,34622000,34627200,give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,34627200,34632800,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,34632800,34638640,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,34638640,34645040,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,34645040,34652640,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,34652640,34658000,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,34658000,34665200,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,34665200,34671596,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,34671596,34677436,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,34677436,34682880,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,34682880,34690160,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,34690160,34697040,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,34697040,34702720,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,34702720,34707840,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,34707840,34713596,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,34713596,34719436,he was curious to know who could be up  there singing the song so jack started
Oo91hfKtl60,34719436,34725840,to climb up the bean tree he fell down  once he fell down twice
Oo91hfKtl60,34725840,34732320,should he give it another try why bother  hey you up there
Oo91hfKtl60,34732320,34737596,shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,34737596,34742880,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,34742880,34748160,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,34748160,34753756,to him from above jack looked closely  and saw this rope resemble the girl's
Oo91hfKtl60,34753756,34760400,braid  jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,34760400,34766960,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really hard the
Oo91hfKtl60,34766960,34774400,princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said i probably have  bruises all over my body because i slept
Oo91hfKtl60,34774400,34781756,on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me  down of the tree i am so grateful i am
Oo91hfKtl60,34781756,34788960,ready to be your bride  that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a
Oo91hfKtl60,34788960,34794880,kingdom too  that's what i'm telling you maybe i will  grow something very interesting in my
Oo91hfKtl60,34794880,34801436,vegetable patch too just like jack but i  have to make sure no pets get into my  beautiful garden

Oo91hfKtl60,35218480,35225520,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,35225520,35232400,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,35232400,35238240,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,35238240,35243596,waiting for christmas to come  so he said just right i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,35243596,35250080,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,35250080,35256160,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,35256160,35261596,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,35261596,35268960,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,35268960,35276400,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,35276400,35281916,there for a long time and even started  to doze off it wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,35281916,35288800,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,35288800,35295520,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back what do you think
Oo91hfKtl60,35295520,35302560,you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of  french and grabbed her chest but it was
Oo91hfKtl60,35302560,35309276,only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go  threatening people i mean foxes like
Oo91hfKtl60,35309276,35314640,that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,35314640,35321840,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,35321840,35329040,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,35329040,35336480,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,35336480,35341596,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,35341596,35348240,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,35348240,35354880,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,35354880,35361360,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,35361360,35366960,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,35366960,35372560,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,35372560,35378000,up to lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,35378000,35383120,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,35383120,35389360,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,35389360,35394400,like a christmas tree only was gray and  upside down and on the ceiling
Oo91hfKtl60,35394400,35399680,so the fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something
Oo91hfKtl60,35399680,35407680,sticking to his tail under the water so  he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,35407680,35413840,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,35413840,35420800,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,35420800,35426720,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,35426720,35433360,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,35433360,35438960,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,35438960,35444320,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,35444320,35451436,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and mean nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,35451436,35457596,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,35457596,35463680,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fishermen  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,35463680,35471680,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,35471680,35477680,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog that i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,35477680,35484400,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,35484400,35490080,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,35490080,35495200,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,36292240,36298160,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,36298160,36304720,you a fairy tale  there was a farmer living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,36304720,36309916,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,36309916,36315040,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,36315040,36322240,jumped down and started digging  something up with a shovel the bear  wanted to find out what was going on but
Oo91hfKtl60,36322240,36327596,he approached the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,36327596,36333596,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,36333596,36340320,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,36340320,36346560,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,36346560,36352720,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,36352720,36358720,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,36358720,36364720,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,36364720,36370560,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer
Oo91hfKtl60,36370560,36377840,we have a deal  i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,36377840,36383520,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,36383520,36391276,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,36391276,36398240,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,36398240,36403596,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom
Oo91hfKtl60,36403596,36410480,they got lots and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the turnips and took  them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,36410480,36416800,where he threw them into a heap  the poor bear was so tired he could  barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,36416800,36423916,then the farmer came over and started to  divide up the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,36423916,36431520,told the bear these are my roots  he gave the bear all the green tops that  were not tasty at all and said all right
Oo91hfKtl60,36431520,36437756,here are your tops  bon appetit bear  the bear tasted them and said ew this
Oo91hfKtl60,36437756,36443120,tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to  me
Oo91hfKtl60,36443120,36449520,a farmer looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked  for the tops didn't you
Oo91hfKtl60,36449520,36455596,the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his  jaw dropped and you could hear his
Oo91hfKtl60,36455596,36461680,stomach making hungry noises the poor  bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,36461680,36468640,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,36468640,36475120,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant 10 rose bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,36475120,36481200,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,36481200,36487200,and  what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,36487200,36493840,my bed with this  choose the flies away and if they wake  me up i'll throw you out and you will
Oo91hfKtl60,36493840,36500000,not get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,36500000,36505756,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,36505756,36511756,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,36511756,36517120,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,36517120,36523360,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,36523360,36528880,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,36528880,36534800,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,36534800,36541040,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,36541040,36547680,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,36547680,36553360,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose the
Oo91hfKtl60,36553360,36560400,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,36560400,36568320,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,36568320,36573360,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,36573360,36579520,just his own nose  let me tell you why it's because people  who are selfish and greedy can see no
Oo91hfKtl60,36579520,36595712,further than the end of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]

Oo91hfKtl60,37037608,37042860,[Music]
Oo91hfKtl60,37043596,37048720,no my little toy friends i can't play  with you right now i'm protecting the
Oo91hfKtl60,37048720,37055360,vegetable garden from all the pests  okay never mind  i wouldn't want you to get bored
Oo91hfKtl60,37055360,37061040,so let me tell you a fairy tale  jack and the beanstalk there was a poor
Oo91hfKtl60,37061040,37066080,widow who lived in a village and she had  a son named jack the widow and her son
Oo91hfKtl60,37066080,37072400,spent all day long taking in their  vegetable garden  whatever grew in that vegetable garden
Oo91hfKtl60,37072400,37079520,that was what they ate then the time  came for jack to get married there was  as many maids in the village as there
Oo91hfKtl60,37079520,37084960,were tears in the patches only all of  them turned jack down
Oo91hfKtl60,37084960,37090800,it's no wonder they refused to marry him  who would have wanted a groom like that
Oo91hfKtl60,37090800,37096400,his pants were torn and had patches his  shoes had holes into the soles and his
Oo91hfKtl60,37096400,37101436,hat was as flat as a pancake  no one would marry him no one would even
Oo91hfKtl60,37101436,37108640,go out with poor jack the widow knew he  needed nicer clothes but there was no  money so she thought about it she
Oo91hfKtl60,37108640,37115276,thought very hard and very long and then  she said  jack my dear boy if you want to get
Oo91hfKtl60,37115276,37120480,married you need to look presentable  i've thought long and hard about this
Oo91hfKtl60,37120480,37125596,and there's nothing left to do but to  sell our spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,37125596,37132080,with the money you get you can buy  yourself a new suit  so jack put a leash on the cow and
Oo91hfKtl60,37132080,37137520,headed to the market but the road was  long and tiring he was halfway to the
Oo91hfKtl60,37137520,37144000,market when he got tired and laid down  under a tree to rest  just when he started to doze off he felt
Oo91hfKtl60,37144000,37150640,something poking at his side  he opened his eyes and saw an old mane
Oo91hfKtl60,37150640,37156960,jack was very surprised and the old man  told him  my boy lets me buy this cow of
Oo91hfKtl60,37156960,37164400,yours and in exchange for your cow will  give you a nice little bean  to tell you the truth jack really didn't
Oo91hfKtl60,37164400,37170000,want to walk from miles and miles to the  marketplace to sell his spot a cow
Oo91hfKtl60,37170000,37175840,so without further ado he agreed to this  deal jack and the old man shook hands
Oo91hfKtl60,37175840,37182240,the old man got the cow jack got the  bean and pleased with himself he headed  for home
Oo91hfKtl60,37182240,37189840,when the widow saw her son without the  cow and without a suit  she got very very scared
Oo91hfKtl60,37189840,37195200,she thought he'd been robbed by the  highwayman but jack told her
Oo91hfKtl60,37195200,37202400,don't you worry mother  just look what i got in exchange for  your old spotted cow
Oo91hfKtl60,37202400,37208800,i got a brand new little bean and i have  never seen a nicer shade of green
Oo91hfKtl60,37208800,37214640,the widow just threw her hands in the  air and said oh what a simpleton you are
Oo91hfKtl60,37214640,37220160,my son  then she grabbed the bean and threw it  out the window
Oo91hfKtl60,37220160,37227360,jack was really surprised why did she  get so upset  he yawned and quickly went to sleep
Oo91hfKtl60,37227360,37234240,when jack woke up in the morning and  looked outside his window he couldn't  believe his eyes
Oo91hfKtl60,37234240,37240000,overnight the bean had grown up to a  humongous enormous bean tree
Oo91hfKtl60,37240000,37245040,the bean tree was so big and tall that  its top reached all the way to the
Oo91hfKtl60,37245040,37250800,clouds high up in the sky  jack could hear a song coming down from  the clouds
Oo91hfKtl60,37250800,37258240,he was curious to know  who could be up there singing the song  so jack started to climb up the bean
Oo91hfKtl60,37258240,37267040,tree  he fell down once he fell down twice  should he give it another try why bother
Oo91hfKtl60,37267040,37274800,hey you up there  shouted jack  can you tell me how to climb this bean
Oo91hfKtl60,37274800,37280080,tree  for some reason i kept falling and  falling
Oo91hfKtl60,37280080,37285360,there was no answer for a while and then  a strange looking rope was thrown down
Oo91hfKtl60,37285360,37292320,to him from above  jack looked closely and saw this rope  resemble the girl's braid
Oo91hfKtl60,37292320,37297596,jack was so happy he gave the braid a  good yank and a beautiful princess fell
Oo91hfKtl60,37297596,37304000,down and landed right next to him  as it turned out it was really her raid
Oo91hfKtl60,37304000,37309040,the princess straightened out her crown  curtsied and said i probably have
Oo91hfKtl60,37309040,37315840,bruises all over my body because i slept  on all those beans  thank you my good friend for bringing me
Oo91hfKtl60,37315840,37320960,down of the tree i am so grateful i am  ready to be your bride
Oo91hfKtl60,37320960,37326160,that's how it came to be that jack got  married became a king and got half a

Oo91hfKtl60,37736828,37742320,[Music]  some people think that decorating a
Oo91hfKtl60,37742320,37749200,christmas tree for the holidays is a  piece of cake  not so my dear friends if decorating is
Oo91hfKtl60,37749200,37755680,not going the way it shoot  do you know what can happen  i'll tell you about it
Oo91hfKtl60,37755680,37762720,the wolf and the fox in a village far  far away there was a man a local  fisherman and his wife and then in the
Oo91hfKtl60,37762720,37769596,force nearby lived a very sly wolf who  was always sneaking over and stealing  fish from the fishermen
Oo91hfKtl60,37769596,37775436,when it was christmas time the men  decorated the christmas tree but he  didn't feel like just sitting around
Oo91hfKtl60,37775436,37780800,waiting for christmas to come  so he said to his wife i'm going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,37780800,37787360,dear  the fox overheard that the fisherman was  going fishing
Oo91hfKtl60,37787360,37793360,so this very sly fox ran out of force on  the road and slaying down and pretended
Oo91hfKtl60,37793360,37798800,to be absolutely not alive  when the man saw the fox
Oo91hfKtl60,37798800,37806160,he said that's good my wife can use the  fur for her coat the man threw the fox  into the sleigh and together they drove
Oo91hfKtl60,37806160,37813596,up the man's favorite spot the fisherman  sat on the ice by the opening and  started fishing up there he was sitting
Oo91hfKtl60,37813596,37819120,there for a long time and even started  to doze off it wasn't having any luck
Oo91hfKtl60,37819120,37826080,catching fish  but the impatient fox couldn't wait and  she sat up and started to watch from the
Oo91hfKtl60,37826080,37831916,sleigh on the sly  suddenly someone came up and screamed  behind the fox's back
Oo91hfKtl60,37831916,37837360,what do you think you're doing  this startled the fox who almost died of
Oo91hfKtl60,37837360,37844240,fret and grabbed her chest but it was  only the wolf  have you got mad wolf you can't go
Oo91hfKtl60,37844240,37851840,threatening people i mean foxes like  that why are you screaming  don't you see we're fishing here the
Oo91hfKtl60,37851840,37859040,first fish is for me  then the second one is for me said the  wolf jumping up and down with joy no no
Oo91hfKtl60,37859040,37866240,no  the second fish is also for me  and the third one the fisherman is mine
Oo91hfKtl60,37866240,37873680,you go find yourself a fisherman and  make him fish for you  the wolf got really sad
Oo91hfKtl60,37873680,37878800,where can i find myself a fisherman and  especially at christmas time
Oo91hfKtl60,37878800,37885436,then catch fish for yourself whispered  the fox  but i don't know how to fish said the
Oo91hfKtl60,37885436,37892080,wolf  why do you come to me with your problems  what's there to know
Oo91hfKtl60,37892080,37898560,throw your tail into the water and sing  the fish a happy song so they swim over
Oo91hfKtl60,37898560,37904160,so the wolf left empty-handed  he found an opening threw his tail down
Oo91hfKtl60,37904160,37909840,into it  and then sang  the christmas tree grew in the pony grew
Oo91hfKtl60,37909840,37915276,up told lundgren  the fish were celebrating christmas in  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,37915276,37920320,just like the humans they even had a  cake but what they didn't have was a
Oo91hfKtl60,37920320,37926560,christmas tree  then they saw the wolf's tail grow  bigger in the water and started to look
Oo91hfKtl60,37926560,37932000,like a christmas tree only was great and  upside down and on the ceiling so the
Oo91hfKtl60,37932000,37939200,fish started decorating the gray  christmas tree the wolf felt something  sticking to his tail under the water so
Oo91hfKtl60,37939200,37944880,he became happy and sang even louder we  decorate the christmas tree and start to
Oo91hfKtl60,37944880,37951040,celebrate  and the fish became happy too and  started dancing around their decorated
Oo91hfKtl60,37951040,37958000,christmas tale it's time to take the  catch out the wolf decided to pull his  tail out he pulled once nothing happened
Oo91hfKtl60,37958000,37963916,he pulled again but the tail wouldn't  butch  that's when the wolf started spanning
Oo91hfKtl60,37963916,37970560,someone help me  my towel is all fished out i can't pull  it out you know what really happened to
Oo91hfKtl60,37970560,37976160,the poor wolf's tail while the wolf was  singing the water froze solid
Oo91hfKtl60,37976160,37981520,then his tail got stuck in the ice the  fox heard the wolf screaming and thought
Oo91hfKtl60,37981520,37988640,did he really catch the fish now he will  eat it all and leave nothing to me  so she forgot about the fishermen and
Oo91hfKtl60,37988640,37994880,ran to the wolf  together they tried to pull the tail out  of the water but they couldn't do it
Oo91hfKtl60,37994880,38000880,okay fox said the wolf go get the  fisherman  you see we're stuck we need help the
Oo91hfKtl60,38000880,38008880,fisherman grabbed the fox the fox  grabbed the wolf the wolf grabbed his  tail but they couldn't pull it out
Oo91hfKtl60,38008880,38014960,the fisherman called his wife his wife  called the dog then i'll call the cat  the cat called the mouse
Oo91hfKtl60,38014960,38021596,all together they pulled and pulled with  all their might and the tail came out of  the water
Oo91hfKtl60,38021596,38027276,of course there were no fish on the trip  just a bunch of christmas decorations
Oo91hfKtl60,38027276,38032400,and that moment the fireworks started  that's what i'm telling you during the

Oo91hfKtl60,38829520,38835436,i know sharing is caring but we're not  talking about me here so i'd better tell
Oo91hfKtl60,38835436,38842000,you a fairy tale  there was a fiber living in a village  the tops and the roots and nearby was
Oo91hfKtl60,38842000,38847200,the forest with all sorts of creatures  living in it including the bear one day
Oo91hfKtl60,38847200,38852320,the bear saw the farmer read his cart  over to a field and when he got there he
Oo91hfKtl60,38852320,38857680,jumped out and started digging something  up with a shovel the bear wanted to find
Oo91hfKtl60,38857680,38864960,out what was going on but he approached  the farm and he asked him  hey farmer what are you doing here
Oo91hfKtl60,38864960,38870880,well bear i need to plow the field plant  the seeds harvest the crops and then eat
Oo91hfKtl60,38870880,38877596,what i reap  the bear became very happy that there  would be something to eat then he asked
Oo91hfKtl60,38877596,38883840,the farmer favor hey farmer please be  kind and give me some of the crops you  harvest
Oo91hfKtl60,38883840,38890000,the farmer scratched the back of his  head and said  fine when my crop grow i will give you
Oo91hfKtl60,38890000,38896000,some  tell me what part of the plants you will  take bear the tops are the roots
Oo91hfKtl60,38896000,38902000,why would i want to eat a bunch of roots  anyway  oh they're so dirty
Oo91hfKtl60,38902000,38909596,so the bear told the farmer of course i  will take the tops  fine said the farmer we have a deal
Oo91hfKtl60,38909596,38915116,i will give you the top  but you have to earn your meal so here's
Oo91hfKtl60,38915116,38920800,the plow  let's go and work the fields  that's the last thing that bear expected
Oo91hfKtl60,38920800,38928560,that he'd be asked to plow the field  like a horse but the bear had no choice  he worked and huffed and puffed
Oo91hfKtl60,38928560,38935520,with the farmer hurrying him from behind  the plow  come on my little pony run faster
Oo91hfKtl60,38935520,38941756,anyway they plowed the fields planted  the seeds and then boom they got lots
Oo91hfKtl60,38941756,38947756,and lots of turnips  the bear picked all the churnips and  took them to the farmer's house
Oo91hfKtl60,38947756,38954080,where he threw them into a heap the poor  bear was so tired he could barely stand
Oo91hfKtl60,38954080,38961200,then the farmer came over and started to  revive the crop  he took all the turnips for himself and
Oo91hfKtl60,38961200,38966400,told the bear these are my roots he gave  the bear all the green tops that were
Oo91hfKtl60,38966400,38972640,not tasty at all and said all right here  are your tops bun up a tea bear
Oo91hfKtl60,38972640,38979596,the bear tasted them and said ew this  tastes horrible these tops are not  edible farmer why did you give them to
Oo91hfKtl60,38979596,38984720,me  a farmer looked at the bear and  pretended to be surprised but you asked
Oo91hfKtl60,38984720,38990800,for the tops didn't you  the bear looked back at the farmer  speechless he just stood there with his
Oo91hfKtl60,38990800,38998960,jaw dropped and you could hear his  stomach making hungry noises  the poor bear he was really hungry
Oo91hfKtl60,38998960,39006000,so he walked up to the farmer and asked  can you spare me some turnips please  fine said the farmer to the bear i'll
Oo91hfKtl60,39006000,39012400,give you some turnips but first you have  to plant ten roast bushes sort three big
Oo91hfKtl60,39012400,39018560,beds of beans wash all the dirty dishes  clean the whole house do all the laundry
Oo91hfKtl60,39018560,39024480,and what else oh yeah  i will go to sleep and you will stand by
Oo91hfKtl60,39024480,39031360,my bed with this  chase the flies away and if they wake me  up i'll throw you out and you will not
Oo91hfKtl60,39031360,39037276,get any turnips  the poor bear side put on an apron and
Oo91hfKtl60,39037276,39043116,started doing all the chores around the  house and the farmer scolded him from  time to time
Oo91hfKtl60,39043116,39049116,what's wrong with you you clumsy bear i  can't sleep with you stomping your feet  can't you be quiet
Oo91hfKtl60,39049116,39054400,finally the farmer went to sleep he was  probably dreaming of gobbling up all the
Oo91hfKtl60,39054400,39060720,turnips  [Music]  and the bear was standing next to the  bed waving his paws to chase the flies
Oo91hfKtl60,39060720,39066240,away  but one fly that was very fat and very  green landed right on the farmer's nose
Oo91hfKtl60,39066240,39072080,and started scrolling up and down  the farmer wiggled his nose like he was
Oo91hfKtl60,39072080,39078400,about to sneeze so the bear got really  scared oh no he will wake up now
Oo91hfKtl60,39078400,39084960,he will wake up  so he raised the fly swatcher and hit  the fly with all his might
Oo91hfKtl60,39084960,39090640,the bear was trying to hit the fly but  he hit the farmer right on the nose a
Oo91hfKtl60,39090640,39097680,farmer jumped up holding his nose and  screaming  my nose that's when the bear completely
Oo91hfKtl60,39097680,39105596,lost it  he turned ran outside fell over the bags  of turnips grabbed the bags and ran off
Oo91hfKtl60,39105596,39110640,with them into the forest  and the farmer was left holding no bag
Oo91hfKtl60,39110640,39117756,just his own nose let me tell you why  it's because people who are selfish and  greedy can see no further than the end
Oo91hfKtl60,39117756,39130332,of their nose  be nice and share  [Music]
