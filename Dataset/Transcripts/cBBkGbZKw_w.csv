cBBkGbZKw_w,1816559,1823760,experience may be a little different is  because  i have no k-12 experience here so being
cBBkGbZKw_w,1823760,1830240,a parent in the district was the big  shock  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,1830480,1836399,from  no not knowing anything that's ex what  to expect
cBBkGbZKw_w,1836399,1842159,at the district  and  the
cBBkGbZKw_w,1842159,1847600,the schedules for me at the first was  the shocking things is

cBBkGbZKw_w,1856159,1862080,actually get to have more time to  bond with my children

cBBkGbZKw_w,1986720,1989720,yarchapoor
cBBkGbZKw_w,1998880,2004399,hi everyone  grateful to be here  and i mean just saying the pledge of
cBBkGbZKw_w,2004399,2010080,allegiance you just realize what an  amazing  country we live in we i appreciate so
cBBkGbZKw_w,2010080,2017120,much you know the opportunity  um  that it brought to my family so um my
cBBkGbZKw_w,2017120,2024320,parents um are iranian and they escaped  iran during the revolution on camels and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2024320,2030720,all kinds of different stories and  ended up in italy  and they had just gotten married so i
cBBkGbZKw_w,2030720,2036159,like to joke that i was made in italy  because they ended up being there for  about nine months
cBBkGbZKw_w,2036159,2042880,and when um  they were trying to figure out where to  go we had family in texas and so
cBBkGbZKw_w,2042880,2050638,they you know  ended up strangely enough going to  juarez and coming to
cBBkGbZKw_w,2050638,2055839,el paso from the  mexican border which makes me a very
cBBkGbZKw_w,2055839,2062158,interesting immigrant in that sense  i was born in houston i grew up in texas
cBBkGbZKw_w,2062158,2067358,and i think one of the hallmarks of the  persian community is  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,2067358,2073520,the strength in our community and family  you know we family is extremely  extremely important to us i can tell you
cBBkGbZKw_w,2073520,2078800,five years from now whose house i'll be  at for shabbat either my mom's or my  mother-in-law's house it's on a very
cBBkGbZKw_w,2078800,2084480,strict schedule i mean it's really  really important my son will  attest to it as well
cBBkGbZKw_w,2084480,2089679,and so you know my parents struggled  when they first came to texas they you
cBBkGbZKw_w,2089679,2096000,know were trying to figure out what they  were going to do  all kinds of different odds and ends um
cBBkGbZKw_w,2096000,2101520,you know pizza shop owner that burnt  down  discount i mean just all different types
cBBkGbZKw_w,2101520,2107920,of work my mom ended up working  as a teacher  which she still does and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2107920,2114960,you know my dad  had you know different businesses  um  and people always ask me
cBBkGbZKw_w,2114960,2120560,and ask my parents you know what did you  guys do so i'm a physician i'm an  allergist
cBBkGbZKw_w,2120560,2126720,my brother below me is a attorney so the  typical persian jewish doctor lawyer my
cBBkGbZKw_w,2126720,2134079,other brother is in his residency right  now for anesthesia  my younger sister you know she
cBBkGbZKw_w,2134079,2139839,strayed a little bit she moved to  fremont to work for neuralink which was  one of the elon musk companies and so
cBBkGbZKw_w,2139839,2144960,you know we all had very very um  strong
cBBkGbZKw_w,2144960,2151040,drives to succeed and to  uh pursue an education um and i think it
cBBkGbZKw_w,2151040,2157520,was just the grit and the resilience  that we saw in our parents i mean my  parents worked really hard
cBBkGbZKw_w,2157520,2163440,they sacrificed everything i mean i  don't think they took  vacations when we were growing up
cBBkGbZKw_w,2163440,2168800,because they wanted to put us in all  they knew was like they wanted to keep  us safe they put us in a private jewish
cBBkGbZKw_w,2168800,2174320,school they you know  basically gave up everything to do that  for us just because you know it was a
cBBkGbZKw_w,2174320,2181119,new world a new community um  as we got older my parents were thinking  you know we have a daughter she has to
cBBkGbZKw_w,2181119,2188000,come into you know the community so we  ended up picking up everything and moved  to la when i was in
cBBkGbZKw_w,2188000,2194640,finished ninth grade i came here  started in a brand new high school i  actually skipped tenth grade which was
cBBkGbZKw_w,2194640,2200000,strange because texas curriculum and  this curriculum was different so i ended  up going into school in 11th grade
cBBkGbZKw_w,2200000,2205839,meeting  all brand new people and it was just you  know trying to maneuver and figure all
cBBkGbZKw_w,2205839,2212880,of that out was you know very a huge  struggle but i think all of these  struggles and and all of these you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,2212880,2219040,different um  things that we had to go through just  made us stronger and you know made us
cBBkGbZKw_w,2219040,2224320,work harder and made us  you know drive to succeed  my dad
cBBkGbZKw_w,2224320,2230960,always would you know push us to succeed  if we came home with a 98 would say you  know where the other two points
cBBkGbZKw_w,2230960,2236160,um and so i mean it's just that that  kind of mentality and i'm just very
cBBkGbZKw_w,2236160,2242480,blessed to  um be raising kids in this community and  i think community is so important
cBBkGbZKw_w,2242480,2249119,um when  jacob was born he didn't breathe  for 10 minutes
cBBkGbZKw_w,2249119,2254720,which you know when he was  in
cBBkGbZKw_w,2254720,2260960,in the delivery room that they were  telling me you know you're not gonna  have a normal child
cBBkGbZKw_w,2260960,2267920,and he beat all the odds he's my miracle  and at that time i i needed the support
cBBkGbZKw_w,2267920,2273280,and so you know we're talking about  community building  one of the things i'm more famous for  than
cBBkGbZKw_w,2273280,2278960,doing you know being a physician is i  started l.a mommies which is a huge
cBBkGbZKw_w,2278960,2285839,mom community  um of about 60 something thousand moms  where people you know can share
cBBkGbZKw_w,2285839,2292320,their different you know stories ask  questions and and just you know  communicate with one another find other
cBBkGbZKw_w,2292320,2298400,people with similar  um interests and  make friends and and build community
cBBkGbZKw_w,2298400,2303760,and you know we we started hawthorne um  a few years ago and it's just been so
cBBkGbZKw_w,2303760,2310240,nice to like meet some of the moms on  the group like one of my good friends  now is somebody that somebody posted and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2310240,2315280,said oh i have a friend who moved here  from london and her daughter is starting  the school are there any hawthorne first
cBBkGbZKw_w,2315280,2322640,grade moms here and it was just such a  nice way of com you know building and  meeting somebody and um
cBBkGbZKw_w,2322640,2330160,i'm just you know so happy to be here  and so happy to share my story and  we you know we're having such a great
cBBkGbZKw_w,2330160,2336079,experience at the schools here and  grateful to you guys for putting on all  of your time and working so hard to just
cBBkGbZKw_w,2336079,2344159,make our schools excellent  so thank you very much  [Applause]
cBBkGbZKw_w,2345440,2350880,thank you michelle that was such so  great to hear your story
cBBkGbZKw_w,2350960,2356240,gabe would you like to go next yeah but  let me just say that the la mommies  group is not just for mommies i've been
cBBkGbZKw_w,2356240,2362960,on there as well and it is an incredible  network so thank you michelle for  all the work you do for our community
cBBkGbZKw_w,2362960,2369599,um much like how uh michelle described  i'm also  persian jewish my family also you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,2369599,2377359,struggled to leave  um iran when the when the islamic  revolution uh started in the late 1970s
cBBkGbZKw_w,2377359,2384000,i was first generation born here  but my parents share very similar  stories about how they had to
cBBkGbZKw_w,2384000,2390000,uh leave iran um  i know that many members of our  community have you know we have a lot of
cBBkGbZKw_w,2390000,2396800,persian jews that live here so many you  know know  something about  uh the community um one thing that i
cBBkGbZKw_w,2396800,2404480,thought was interesting to share is that  you know the  the persian jewish heritage goes back in  iran for literally thousands of years i
cBBkGbZKw_w,2404480,2410800,mean you know it was kind of an insular  community in different parts of iran and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2410800,2416800,all of a sudden uprooted and much like  how michelle shared you had families  going to germany or italy or finding
cBBkGbZKw_w,2416800,2422560,their ways to england or here or whatnot  but somehow they all found each other  again
cBBkGbZKw_w,2422560,2428640,and uh so there are  many persian jews living in this  community you know so i was born here in
cBBkGbZKw_w,2428640,2434160,1981 and i started my um formal  education by going to private jewish
cBBkGbZKw_w,2434160,2440880,schools um my parents thought it was  really important to find  you know other jewish you know put all
cBBkGbZKw_w,2440880,2446079,the jewish kids together um  but then i was lucky enough to get a  permit to come to the beverly hills
cBBkGbZKw_w,2446079,2452160,schools as i've shared here on this  board before when i was 10 years old and  in fifth grade i started hawthorne and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2452160,2458400,when i went to temple emanuel for jewish  school i was the only persian kid in the  class i was by far
cBBkGbZKw_w,2458400,2464319,the you know darkest uh kid and i i  didn't i i had my persian jewish
cBBkGbZKw_w,2464319,2470880,heritage but it was more at home and i  had my own experience  and of what it was like to be a persian
cBBkGbZKw_w,2470880,2477599,jew and then i and then i started at  hawthorne and i got more of an education  about what it was to be persian at
cBBkGbZKw_w,2477599,2483920,hawthorne than i got from my own family  all of a sudden the language wasn't just  something that i would hear when my
cBBkGbZKw_w,2483920,2490319,grandma spoke to me i would hear it at  school i  i learned about how other families
cBBkGbZKw_w,2490319,2497440,celebrate  things like shabbat and even you know  norus and that was the first it never
cBBkGbZKw_w,2497440,2504240,i didn't really comprehend  that there were  um  persians that were that were not jewish
cBBkGbZKw_w,2504240,2509599,the majority of persians are actually  muslim and we had  you know uh several
cBBkGbZKw_w,2509599,2516800,uh  you know persian muslims and we learned  about how we celebrate some of the  persian holidays uh but differently and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2516800,2522400,it was you know quite an you know quite  an education one story that i wanted to  share was
cBBkGbZKw_w,2522400,2529119,um  most of my friends in hawthorne as mrs  marcus might remember uh were a group of
cBBkGbZKw_w,2529119,2535760,persian boys but we had you know one  friend that was  of japanese first generation
cBBkGbZKw_w,2535760,2541119,but japanese descent his name was uh  yoji goto he actually ended up moving
cBBkGbZKw_w,2541119,2547040,back to japan we had a korean friend so  on and so forth and we learned a lot  from each other we learned language from
cBBkGbZKw_w,2547040,2553440,each other and the persian boys spoke  farsi so often and different lingo that
cBBkGbZKw_w,2553440,2559920,uh our our friends would pick up on it  and i remember one time yoji my japanese  friend came over to shabbat and my
cBBkGbZKw_w,2559920,2567440,grandma was speaking farsi and he knew  enough that he could hang he said you  know salam he said hello he said how are
cBBkGbZKw_w,2567440,2574000,you you know  like he he literally could hang at a  shabbat dinner with all that he learned
cBBkGbZKw_w,2574000,2579680,and i think it was it's it's so  interesting how much  in this community we have we have
cBBkGbZKw_w,2579680,2584720,learned from each other and how much it  has made  um us stronger
cBBkGbZKw_w,2584720,2591200,but going forward and just appreciating  other  um other heritages other nationalities
cBBkGbZKw_w,2591200,2598000,other ethnicities and so i was thinking  about my  my dad who came here and uh you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,2598000,2604480,when him and i started a company  together that we sold it was called flow  technologies um our
cBBkGbZKw_w,2604480,2611119,our company ended up becoming a melting  pot of so many different  uh cultures more than he ever could have
cBBkGbZKw_w,2611119,2617760,imagined when he was working in iran and  all he worked with with persians  our our company was about 60 people when
cBBkGbZKw_w,2617760,2623440,we sold it and it had  taiwanese  employees uh you know nationals that
cBBkGbZKw_w,2623440,2630800,were actually working in tyron we had  turkish employees persian employees  argentinian russian israeli ecuadorian
cBBkGbZKw_w,2630800,2637599,irish australian chinese and  african-american and i just i just think  it's such a beautiful story about how
cBBkGbZKw_w,2637599,2643599,you know even though it's so sad that  you know so many people me being persian  but so many have had to leave their you
cBBkGbZKw_w,2643599,2648960,know homeland after thousands of years  or hundreds of years or whatever it's  been because of different wars and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2648960,2655520,conflicts that have occurred but then  you come here and you come to this  country and we find each other and we  become one and we just you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,2655520,2661520,appreciate each other's differences and  learn from each other  and um  proud of this community for what it does
cBBkGbZKw_w,2661520,2667839,and thank you again president wells for  having you know stuff like this to  spotlight things from our community i
cBBkGbZKw_w,2667839,2673000,think it's a beautiful thing so thank  you
cBBkGbZKw_w,2676800,2682160,i'm going to read uh  this letter from sharon prusovsky she
cBBkGbZKw_w,2682160,2687920,wanted to be here tonight but she's in  mexico city and i think her letter also  is just
cBBkGbZKw_w,2687920,2693920,one of the things i think that we're  seeing is there are so many  commonalities in our stories and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2693920,2700400,even with claire with your story with  my father who is japanese-american
cBBkGbZKw_w,2700400,2707040,when i was a kid growing up  our family adopted a vietnamese family  there was a vietnamese refugee family
cBBkGbZKw_w,2707040,2712800,and part of the reason that  our family became like the lead with  that family is because our family my
cBBkGbZKw_w,2712800,2718400,father was japanese and so the community  that because he was asian that of course  he could be
cBBkGbZKw_w,2718400,2724640,the family that  the  person that could best communicate with  the family that was vietnamese but of
cBBkGbZKw_w,2724640,2729760,course he didn't speak vietnamese  but um  you know at the beginning he would take
cBBkGbZKw_w,2729760,2734800,their daughter who could speak a little  bit of english and every week he would  take her to the market and take her to
cBBkGbZKw_w,2734800,2741040,the bank and you know basically show her  what how to you know get around in our  in this culture and take her to the
cBBkGbZKw_w,2741040,2748160,market and show what different foods  were and how to cook with those foods  and  um that family for me i that's how i
cBBkGbZKw_w,2748160,2754079,first got introduced to vietnamese food  we would go to their apartment and their  family would cook for us and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2754079,2761920,um  you know at the end of that story both  their daughters  um went to ucla they became doctors they
cBBkGbZKw_w,2761920,2768480,they got married they had their kids we  went to their weddings and our families  became very close so it's just a it's a
cBBkGbZKw_w,2768480,2776000,very similar story of how the cultures  just really merge and  it's very relatable in so many ways
cBBkGbZKw_w,2776000,2781280,so this is a story a letter from sharon  and she's speaking about cultural
cBBkGbZKw_w,2781280,2786960,heritage  and she says it's truly an honor to be a  part of an international city like
cBBkGbZKw_w,2786960,2794240,beverly hills which is comprised of  people from different countries  this diversity gives our community power
cBBkGbZKw_w,2794240,2801280,because learning from other cultures and  backgrounds brings a wider perspective  it increases our capacity to understand
cBBkGbZKw_w,2801280,2807280,why people behave and do things the way  they do  our own international experience my own
cBBkGbZKw_w,2807280,2813119,international experience comes from  mexico city  where community values drive our  activities
cBBkGbZKw_w,2813119,2818240,like spending time with our families  being a good friend  supporting the community
cBBkGbZKw_w,2818240,2824240,volunteering in classrooms sharing our  distinctive cuisine  listening to our music
cBBkGbZKw_w,2824240,2831520,speaking different languages and even  organizing impromptu events where  community interaction is important
cBBkGbZKw_w,2831520,2836800,my biggest contribution to the school  district was my support for cultural  arts
cBBkGbZKw_w,2836800,2843920,i learned in mexico that sharing  cultural arts is extremely important  we tell the stories of our community and
cBBkGbZKw_w,2843920,2849040,share what is in our cult in our  creative imaginations  so that we may
cBBkGbZKw_w,2849040,2855200,so  we must tell the stories of our  community and share what is in our  creative imaginations
cBBkGbZKw_w,2855200,2862000,so that we may learn from one another  regardless of our origins  art is universal
cBBkGbZKw_w,2862000,2867760,i brought that experience from mexico  and gave it to our community for many  years
cBBkGbZKw_w,2867760,2874319,language is another way to connect  during my time in the school district i  met several families that spoke spanish
cBBkGbZKw_w,2874319,2880240,and hebrew  it was a way to connect to one another  without cultural barriers
cBBkGbZKw_w,2880240,2886559,this is why it is so important to teach  and learn different languages in school  speaking a different language opened
cBBkGbZKw_w,2886559,2892960,doors to the world and people  speaking four languages has shown me  that connection
cBBkGbZKw_w,2892960,2899280,and gives me a sense of belonging no  matter where i am  this is from sharon prizovsky
cBBkGbZKw_w,2899280,2904079,so i'm going to go around i can see  rochelle is ready to speak
cBBkGbZKw_w,2904480,2910960,i i don't actually have a speech about  my difference or coming to america  because luckily i come from middle
cBBkGbZKw_w,2910960,2916240,america  and i was surrounded by  probably
cBBkGbZKw_w,2916240,2923200,white caucasian but we were the only  jewish family that lived where we lived  in minneapolis and i did face a lot of
cBBkGbZKw_w,2923200,2928880,anti-semitism at that time  uh i i would i'm not dwelling on my
cBBkGbZKw_w,2928880,2935119,story because i think we've heard such  wonderful stories tonight i would hate  to try to even come close to some of
cBBkGbZKw_w,2935119,2943200,those i would just like to share a  couple comments that i wrote about of  hearing  from some of the people that spoke um
cBBkGbZKw_w,2943200,2949680,first of all i have to tell you i want  to thank you for sharing your stories i  love hearing them and i have to tell you
cBBkGbZKw_w,2949680,2956720,uh gabe will appreciate this mr hurley  me and  michelle when i was teaching at
cBBkGbZKw_w,2956720,2963040,hawthorne and or el rodeo to start with  when the influx of the uh iranian
cBBkGbZKw_w,2963040,2972000,community started to come and i had the  students who couldn't speak english  and i was always amazed at how much they
cBBkGbZKw_w,2972000,2979359,wanted the education and they would  carry around their little dictionaries  persian to american and they would use
cBBkGbZKw_w,2979359,2985119,them all the time and of course i i  didn't you could use them anytime they  wanted in my class but i was always
cBBkGbZKw_w,2985119,2991119,amazed at how they wanted to know what  every word was and so on and i  appreciated their
cBBkGbZKw_w,2991119,2997680,learning and that they wanted to have  that great education  and how well most of them do today they
cBBkGbZKw_w,2997680,3005200,are doctors they are lawyers they are  real estate people they are doing  extremely well the the new generation
cBBkGbZKw_w,3005200,3010880,that came from  iran uh  i also but i do remember once this was
cBBkGbZKw_w,3010880,3017040,something i always used to say to the  kids in school i would walk down the  hall and the persian kids would be  speaking persian to one another and i
cBBkGbZKw_w,3017040,3022480,would walk by and i said no you have to  speak english i wanted them to learn to  speak english i wasn't trying to take
cBBkGbZKw_w,3022480,3028319,away their persian but they were in the  american school and i always used to say  you got to speak of america english here
cBBkGbZKw_w,3028319,3034319,and they would look at me and  they would they would try to change then  so that was something that i always
cBBkGbZKw_w,3034319,3040400,tried to get them to do because i wanted  them they were here in america to learn  english i didn't want them to lose their
cBBkGbZKw_w,3040400,3047040,culture at home but in school they had  to because i couldn't understand them  and i wanted them to learn how to speak
cBBkGbZKw_w,3047040,3052640,english so i used to say  english please english please  and they would they would struggle but
cBBkGbZKw_w,3052640,3058240,they did it they did it and they're  today they're what second third  generation here and many of them have
cBBkGbZKw_w,3058240,3065440,even lost the persian they don't even  know how to speak persian i understand  many of the kids that uh of the long the
cBBkGbZKw_w,3065440,3070480,older generation  so i want to thank you again for sharing  your stories i love this
cBBkGbZKw_w,3070480,3076400,highlight that we're hearing and i think  it's something we can continue to do
cBBkGbZKw_w,3076960,3082400,you just reminded me of one really funny  story so just just real quick  in seventh grade
cBBkGbZKw_w,3082400,3087440,uh  we were in dr grant's spanish class and  i remember i and and i was a very
cBBkGbZKw_w,3087440,3093440,involved student i was like the  president of the school at hawthorne it  was eighth grade president of the school  at hawthorne and so i was kind of
cBBkGbZKw_w,3093440,3098720,responsible to set a bit of an example  and  i remember yelling something across the
cBBkGbZKw_w,3098720,3104960,class in farsi and mrs ginsberg happens  to walk in she was the assistant  principal at the time she happens to
cBBkGbZKw_w,3104960,3111920,walk in at that exact moment  and she's like gabe  no farsi in school like you know you
cBBkGbZKw_w,3111920,3118160,have to you have to speak in english you  know the other kids aren't going to  understand and then
cBBkGbZKw_w,3118160,3123520,and then there there was a  hispanic kid that sat in the back i  can't remember his name right now but he
cBBkGbZKw_w,3123520,3129200,said oh don't worry we understand like  because like they just like you know all  the kids picked up on so much farsi they
cBBkGbZKw_w,3129200,3136640,knew exactly what i was saying it was  just this really funny uh moment but yes  we had to be very i work in the sinai
cBBkGbZKw_w,3136640,3142960,temple sisterhood and many of the ladies  that i work with i'm in charge of them  and they they'll chatter away whatever
cBBkGbZKw_w,3142960,3149200,they're doing all day while they're  chopping vegetables they're chopping  away and they're speaking farsi and i  have no idea what they're saying and
cBBkGbZKw_w,3149200,3157440,i'll turn to them and i'll say  english please it's just like being back  in school and they practice on me
cBBkGbZKw_w,3158000,3164000,thanks  well i also want to extend a hearty  thank you for sharing

cBBkGbZKw_w,3189599,3196640,different through ways and that takes a  lot of strategic thinking and also  courage um and also i hear the gratitude
cBBkGbZKw_w,3196640,3202800,the gratitude for coming to this country  claire you spoke about how um you're  grateful that you have more time with

cBBkGbZKw_w,3676960,3683280,our summer school staff that were  hard at work and uh and many of our  staff that haven't had a break because
cBBkGbZKw_w,3683280,3688318,we went right into summer school right  after the last day of school

cBBkGbZKw_w,3695359,3701200,department and area  and really the goal  for me to share with you now is just
cBBkGbZKw_w,3701200,3706960,kind of where are we  today with security um and a couple of  things i want to talk about
cBBkGbZKw_w,3706960,3714319,um is just the accountability of our  program uh the transparency of our  program and some of the proac
cBBkGbZKw_w,3714319,3721039,proactive  demonstration  where the hiring that we've done some of  the programs that we've put into place
cBBkGbZKw_w,3721039,3728160,some of the communication that we put  into place on the accountability piece  we are so fortunate to live in beverly
cBBkGbZKw_w,3728160,3734400,hills where  we just have so many resources  we have such a good relationship with
cBBkGbZKw_w,3734400,3741200,our police department  we are  continuing that relationship but also  building upon that relationship
cBBkGbZKw_w,3741200,3747680,as we move into the summer and into next  school year  that partnership is starting to increase
cBBkGbZKw_w,3747680,3753440,some of the things that they're doing  with their watch center are  things that we're starting to do in our
cBBkGbZKw_w,3753440,3759760,school district so there's  a lot of alignment that's happening with  safety and security in our city and also
cBBkGbZKw_w,3759760,3766160,in our school district um and also for  the accountability piece is just the  employees that we have in the different
cBBkGbZKw_w,3766160,3772400,resources programs that we have  to ensure the safety  and security of all of our students and
cBBkGbZKw_w,3772400,3777680,staff  the transparency on june 16th i did
cBBkGbZKw_w,3777680,3783760,share a comprehensive  update to the entire community and to  our local press
cBBkGbZKw_w,3783760,3790720,as far as our safety position  in the district that really gives us an  opportunity to now reimagine our
cBBkGbZKw_w,3790720,3797520,security program again really fortunate  to live where we live to have the  resources that we have in the city but
cBBkGbZKw_w,3797520,3802880,also the resources that have been built  in our own school district we're in a
cBBkGbZKw_w,3802880,3808240,really good place  and  ahead of  most school districts i would say any
cBBkGbZKw_w,3808240,3814880,public school district  around  building this bridge of connectivity
cBBkGbZKw_w,3814880,3820880,is really important creating this new  position that is a boots on the ground  position
cBBkGbZKw_w,3820880,3826559,and this includes  higher visibility in  our schools
cBBkGbZKw_w,3826559,3832480,working with our parents in many of our  the site councils and some of the safety  plans that
cBBkGbZKw_w,3832480,3838880,the site councils are building  as well as a lot of the resources that  we have it's really this opportunity for
cBBkGbZKw_w,3838880,3844160,us to pull  all of these resources together  they're there
cBBkGbZKw_w,3844160,3849200,we've been  working to develop a lot of programs and  resources
cBBkGbZKw_w,3849200,3856640,but they've been kind of on an island  and so it's really this opportunity to  pull them all together
cBBkGbZKw_w,3857119,3862960,being proactive is a really important  part of our security plan as we move  into the future
cBBkGbZKw_w,3862960,3869599,as i said in the communication that i  put out we do have a command center in  our district on the high school
cBBkGbZKw_w,3869599,3875119,property and this is an opportunity to  take a lot of those resources that i was
cBBkGbZKw_w,3875119,3881839,talking about like  our surveillance  and our cameras um you know our radios
cBBkGbZKw_w,3881839,3888319,and really pulling everything together  into a central place um the city is  doing very much the same thing in a
cBBkGbZKw_w,3888319,3895200,watch center  for beverly hills and um we're sharing a  lot of strategy we're sharing a lot of
cBBkGbZKw_w,3895200,3901839,resources so that what's happening in  one place there's similar things  happening in another
cBBkGbZKw_w,3901839,3909280,and that is something that we have not  had before  um having our director of school safety  being supported by a command center
cBBkGbZKw_w,3909280,3915280,that has  personnel that  are in our command center working with
cBBkGbZKw_w,3915280,3920960,our principals and our other security  resources that we have in our school  district to ensure
cBBkGbZKw_w,3920960,3929119,safety and security  for all of our students and also our  staff  and any visitors that we have
cBBkGbZKw_w,3929119,3935680,just go back for one second so just the  um  in a crisis situation um you know what
cBBkGbZKw_w,3935680,3942799,will be different next year kind of this  where we are today is really having  somebody that has the the leadership and
cBBkGbZKw_w,3942799,3949440,ability to be in all of our schools  actively taking a part in the training
cBBkGbZKw_w,3949440,3956079,and support  for our students and our drills  and all of our safety programs that we
cBBkGbZKw_w,3956079,3963520,have as well as those  developing  the safety plans at some of our sites
cBBkGbZKw_w,3963520,3969760,this is a person that will  go back to  something that we had a long time ago  which was having a district level safety
cBBkGbZKw_w,3969760,3976400,program which is really important to  have input from each of our schools and  i've received a lot of feedback from our
cBBkGbZKw_w,3976400,3981520,parents about how important that is and  so  we're going to make sure that that is a  priority
cBBkGbZKw_w,3981520,3988079,for our school district  so we have our
cBBkGbZKw_w,3988079,3994240,some leaders that i'd like to introduce  you to if you haven't had the chance to  meet them already but mr mark meade and
cBBkGbZKw_w,3994240,3999680,also this is sean o'connor  and  mr mead will be in that leadership
cBBkGbZKw_w,3999680,4005039,position and has a strength in so many  areas as i pointed out to you in my
cBBkGbZKw_w,4005039,4011440,communication to you  but somebody there isn't anybody that  knows  our schools better
cBBkGbZKw_w,4011440,4016559,than having a a strong school leader  who already has connections with our
cBBkGbZKw_w,4016559,4023440,police department  and also working with sean o'connor who  is in our command center um who's just
cBBkGbZKw_w,4023440,4029039,doing that daily work in our command  center real-time  support
cBBkGbZKw_w,4029039,4036318,for our students and our staff in every  area of safety and security
cBBkGbZKw_w,4038960,4045760,and something that we are working on  right now is we are working with the  joint regional intelligence center so
cBBkGbZKw_w,4045760,4051520,um at jri j-r-i-j-r-i-c  um this is an organization that works
cBBkGbZKw_w,4051520,4057280,with our police department  um who then works with their local  schools to do an assessment
cBBkGbZKw_w,4057280,4062480,um which is really needed  we need to look at with all the the
cBBkGbZKw_w,4062480,4069440,programs that we have the support the  staff is to look at the vulnerability of  each of our schools and so there's a
cBBkGbZKw_w,4069440,4075039,pretty lengthy application  process in place  and so i want to thank many of the staff
cBBkGbZKw_w,4075039,4082400,members that  assisted me in in completing all of the  applications for all four of our schools
cBBkGbZKw_w,4082400,4088240,this information this these applications  were already turned into sergeant perez
cBBkGbZKw_w,4088240,4094160,at the beverly hills police department  and he is partnering with us  to go through the joint regional
cBBkGbZKw_w,4094160,4101600,intelligence center  to conduct an assessment  i've asked for them to expedite this
cBBkGbZKw_w,4101600,4106640,occurring  so that we can get the results back as  soon as possible
cBBkGbZKw_w,4106640,4112318,we definitely  want to  have a guide we want to have data we
cBBkGbZKw_w,4112318,4119520,want to see where we have areas of  improvement and so  i think this is a really brave move to
cBBkGbZKw_w,4119520,4127199,do this um so that we can get an honest  feedback with our program um so i'm
cBBkGbZKw_w,4127199,4133758,really excited to be able to do this and  and partner with the police department  one area that we know we need to do more
cBBkGbZKw_w,4133758,4139920,work in is having our police department  in our schools doing the drills so that
cBBkGbZKw_w,4139920,4146080,they can get to know our schools so they  they know  where to go when needed again we have a
cBBkGbZKw_w,4146080,4152400,lot of resources to help  our police department get to where they  need to get
cBBkGbZKw_w,4152400,4159758,with the resources we have  but there's no better way than to to  have these drills in our own schools
cBBkGbZKw_w,4159758,4168239,so that  we're not doing false  situations we're making them as  authentic as possible
cBBkGbZKw_w,4168798,4176159,moving on just to some we've some great  new staff that are coming we also have  as you know some sad uh goodbyes to some
cBBkGbZKw_w,4176159,4181278,people that have worked really hard for  us and have put really good systems in
cBBkGbZKw_w,4181278,4186480,place and so i'm welcoming  some people here um with our our new
cBBkGbZKw_w,4186480,4193838,assistant superintendent for business  services rafael guzman our new director  of technology sandy sosi um just talked
cBBkGbZKw_w,4193838,4201120,about mark mead as our director of  school safety  maggie mabry as our elementary education
cBBkGbZKw_w,4201120,4206480,coordinator  at the bottom there we have phil chang  many people will
cBBkGbZKw_w,4206480,4213520,remember mr chang from the high school  and he will stay at the high school and  he's excited to begin his
cBBkGbZKw_w,4213520,4218719,assistant principal career there  and what a great hire
cBBkGbZKw_w,4218719,4223840,boy that was one energetic interview um  from mr chang so um he is well on his
cBBkGbZKw_w,4223840,4229840,way there  um  we have sarah perkins assistant  principal

cBBkGbZKw_w,4235600,4242800,up with some leadership  areas to assist with ken haas and then  of course sean o'connor so
cBBkGbZKw_w,4242800,4248880,we are very thankful to the board for  some of the new staff that we have we're  still doing some hiring and we look
cBBkGbZKw_w,4248880,4254480,forward to reporting that back to you um  something i've said over and over again  is
cBBkGbZKw_w,4254480,4260000,that i believe this is the strongest  applicant candidate pool  that i've ever seen
cBBkGbZKw_w,4260000,4265760,ever in my career and so we're really  pulling good people  that
cBBkGbZKw_w,4265760,4272040,that want to be here for the right  reasons and certainly have a lot to  offer
cBBkGbZKw_w,4273120,4278239,and lastly i want to leave you with um  something that's really exciting to me  is is when
cBBkGbZKw_w,4278239,4283679,you know our our own staff come back um  especially leadership uh in our own  staff
cBBkGbZKw_w,4283679,4288880,come back with a with a really good idea  and um i met with uh elena castanon
cBBkGbZKw_w,4288880,4294000,who's the president for bhea who's here  tonight  and she had an idea that was a really
cBBkGbZKw_w,4294000,4300560,good one and i wanted to just make you  aware in a transparent way  that um you know this is a truly an idea
cBBkGbZKw_w,4300560,4305840,that we're all in this together and as  you know  many times the state will hand out
cBBkGbZKw_w,4305840,4312239,unfunded mandates and that just happens  and that list seems to grow and grow  um every year
cBBkGbZKw_w,4312239,4319600,um but elena's idea was a really good  one and that is to work together  with the district and to work with other
cBBkGbZKw_w,4319600,4325679,entities as well so our p not only our  pta but also even our students in asb
cBBkGbZKw_w,4325679,4331040,that there are there just for advocacy  um as a basic aids school district
cBBkGbZKw_w,4331040,4336159,oftentimes you know we're we are handed  things without any funding
cBBkGbZKw_w,4336159,4341920,and which is unlike some of the lcff  districts where  they are provided a little bit more
cBBkGbZKw_w,4341920,4348640,money to  help support some of the mandates  and so  being a basic aid or community-funded
cBBkGbZKw_w,4348640,4354719,school district as we are  we really need to stick together because  there's uh there's more of us there's
cBBkGbZKw_w,4354719,4359840,you know santa monica malibu now is a  basic aid school district and so that
cBBkGbZKw_w,4359840,4367600,advocacy piece whether it's through  legislation but we need to stick  together  because the funding must come with these
cBBkGbZKw_w,4367600,4373520,mandates  they seem to be coming faster  and faster each year
cBBkGbZKw_w,4373520,4379760,and  we are able to take them many of them  are very good ideas uh for example uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,4379760,4387040,you know universal uh transitional  kindergarten is a really good one but  that is not something that comes
cBBkGbZKw_w,4387040,4394080,without funds and so you know we're  putting a lot of money into these  programs and together
cBBkGbZKw_w,4394080,4400159,as  employee groups  certainly our unions um to partner with
cBBkGbZKw_w,4400159,4407520,us to support our school district um in  ensuring that we get the funding that we  need to offer the programs that are
cBBkGbZKw_w,4407520,4414320,being required by the state so um i know  elaine is here tonight i just want to  thank her for reaching out to me and and
cBBkGbZKw_w,4414320,4420000,you know that approachability is really  important in our work and um and and  i've thought a lot about our
cBBkGbZKw_w,4420000,4426719,conversation since we had it um and  we're all in and we we can't wait to  start meeting and being advocates
cBBkGbZKw_w,4426719,4429120,together
cBBkGbZKw_w,4432719,4439280,and uh just to end with uh something i  just talked about before just this  unpredictableness of of our world where
cBBkGbZKw_w,4439280,4446640,we are um i was having a conversation  with miss margot yesterday and he had  mentioned uh the importance of uh title
cBBkGbZKw_w,4446640,4452960,ix  which  is uh is is really important for just  gender equity
cBBkGbZKw_w,4452960,4460480,female male students um  having the same opportunities um not  being discriminated against and so we
cBBkGbZKw_w,4460480,4465920,have silently celebrated um a victory  for title ix
cBBkGbZKw_w,4465920,4473520,um and uh it simply reads no person in  the united states shall on basis of sex  be excluded from participation be denied
cBBkGbZKw_w,4473520,4479840,the benefits or subjected to the  discrimination under any education  program or activity receiving federal
cBBkGbZKw_w,4479840,4485040,financial assistance these words helped  to balance the scales of equity
cBBkGbZKw_w,4485040,4490239,and equality  we need to heed their importance and  allow them to echo as we continue to
cBBkGbZKw_w,4490239,4496719,navigate these difficult times  so um you know there's a lot going on  but there's a lot of good things a lot
cBBkGbZKw_w,4496719,4502880,of celebrations happening that are  offering our students  and our staff and our parents equal
cBBkGbZKw_w,4502880,4508800,opportunities  and that is my report  thank you
cBBkGbZKw_w,4508800,4515760,michelle  well thank you again dr berger for that  very very informative and comprehensive
cBBkGbZKw_w,4515760,4521840,report i really appreciate hearing  there's a couple comments that i made  i really don't have too many questions
cBBkGbZKw_w,4521840,4528640,except there was one  on the j-i-r-c i know the first thing i  said to myself is you started to talk
cBBkGbZKw_w,4528640,4534719,about that was  when will we get it and then you said  you had asked them to get it quickly so
cBBkGbZKw_w,4534719,4540080,i wondered if you had been given any  idea at all about when we might get that  one because that was the first question
cBBkGbZKw_w,4540080,4547120,i wrote down  as you started to talk about it yeah and  so um  not yet so um and i and i also want to
cBBkGbZKw_w,4547120,4552239,give a shout out to the um hawthorne  site council also because i received
cBBkGbZKw_w,4552239,4557520,that information at the same time the  police department was sharing this  opportunity so um
cBBkGbZKw_w,4557520,4562560,i like that proactive approach as well  um we're all all thinking the same way
cBBkGbZKw_w,4562560,4569760,um but i do not know exactly when that  will be  we did submit the um i submitted the
cBBkGbZKw_w,4569760,4576800,applications to sergeant perez he  assured me that he has submitted them  today to the jric
cBBkGbZKw_w,4576800,4583360,and um and then i specifically asked him  to expedite that so i'll keep you  updated on when that's going to happen
cBBkGbZKw_w,4583360,4589280,i'm not sure if this is a  um  going to be an audit so to speak or
cBBkGbZKw_w,4589280,4596960,assessment where our kids are in school  or if they're not in school or if  there's multiple parts to the assessment
cBBkGbZKw_w,4596960,4602320,but when i find out i will let you know  thank you uh okay just a couple of  comments then
cBBkGbZKw_w,4602320,4608320,well first of all i was glad to see that  you were able to get out a little bit  into the classroom during the summer  time i thought that's exciting for you
cBBkGbZKw_w,4608320,4614560,because i know  that you like to do that and that's uh  something that you don't get to do very  often so it was really great that you
cBBkGbZKw_w,4614560,4620000,were able to  to do that thank you um  i would like to just mention one thing
cBBkGbZKw_w,4620000,4625360,many people think that the teachers you  know summer's over teachers go on  vacation and things like that that
cBBkGbZKw_w,4625360,4631440,doesn't happen too much in beverly hills  so many of our teachers are involved in  professional development or developing
cBBkGbZKw_w,4631440,4637920,programs or what have you or working  with students and and so many of them  are still here working in the classroom
cBBkGbZKw_w,4637920,4644560,and i'd like to acknowledge that because  with they they're developing programs or  curriculums or some of them are studying
cBBkGbZKw_w,4644560,4650560,how to and  integrate the new science textbooks and  so on and there to even though they're
cBBkGbZKw_w,4650560,4655840,taking their time but it it  really makes you feel good that they  want to know how to use these new
cBBkGbZKw_w,4655840,4660880,materials that they're going to get and  that's just one example so i would like  to just shout out to them because i
cBBkGbZKw_w,4660880,4667120,think that's important  um  uh  you were talking a little bit about the
cBBkGbZKw_w,4667120,4674320,um  uh  the recognition i'd like to just mention  that the  health and safety commission and the
cBBkGbZKw_w,4674320,4681520,human relations commission when you were  talking about that portion of it  that the connection between the school
cBBkGbZKw_w,4681520,4688719,and the district is the liaison that we  go to their meetings we report to them  what's happening in the schools and we
cBBkGbZKw_w,4688719,4693840,get to hear what they're doing to bring  back to the board meetings and that's  something that i know we're going to be
cBBkGbZKw_w,4693840,4700560,addressing because that's going to be a  change in our  format on the program so i just wanted
cBBkGbZKw_w,4700560,4707199,to share that because i know it's coming  next  and let's see i had a couple other  comments um
cBBkGbZKw_w,4707199,4714239,i was going to talk about the one  and elena you mentioned the  collaboration and so on well the very
cBBkGbZKw_w,4714239,4722640,first thing that we can remember that  was beset upon most was this tk with no  funding and uh and we have no choice and
cBBkGbZKw_w,4722640,4727840,so working together to try to to meet  that mandate is an important thing so i
cBBkGbZKw_w,4727840,4735840,would just like to share that  and um again  i think that um
cBBkGbZKw_w,4736080,4742239,oh and i just want to say that i've had  a chance to observe the command center  and watch the real time and it's really
cBBkGbZKw_w,4742239,4750159,exciting so  i know that that's going to be very  important and  thank you again thank you
cBBkGbZKw_w,4750500,4757280,[Music]  well dr brady thank you for your report  a couple comments um
cBBkGbZKw_w,4757280,4763520,one on  security we all agree that our top  priority is of course keeping our
cBBkGbZKw_w,4763520,4769520,students and our teachers  safe from many  harm and i just wanted to stop and thank
cBBkGbZKw_w,4769520,4776960,you for your leadership because  uh we did have a  void we have a bit of a void with tcds
cBBkGbZKw_w,4776960,4783280,stepping out you know changing over  leadership in the security program and  we asked you to really take the reins
cBBkGbZKw_w,4783280,4789520,and you have and it's obvious and i just  you know i really appreciate  how you and your team have stepped in
cBBkGbZKw_w,4789520,4794960,and  you know bringing in  mark mead i think is a is a decision
cBBkGbZKw_w,4794960,4800640,that we  all  appreciate and support
cBBkGbZKw_w,4800640,4807440,and agree with your comment about  pulling the resources of our community  together that's something that we've  talked about a lot and i think that's a
cBBkGbZKw_w,4807440,4813840,great example of how we're doing just  that so  i wanted to thank you for that um i also  wanted to say
cBBkGbZKw_w,4813840,4819040,uh how much i appreciate the new  additions that we're bringing in to the  cabinet
cBBkGbZKw_w,4819040,4824639,you know we've had the chance to  meet with to many of those folks  one-on-one and i would agree they're
cBBkGbZKw_w,4824639,4830000,very impressive and  that's a great it's a great sign for our
cBBkGbZKw_w,4830000,4836159,community for our school district and a  sign of a healthy administration and so  i wanted to thank you for that too um
cBBkGbZKw_w,4836159,4842560,one question that i had and i'm i'm you  know sorry if uh you know you're not  prepared to answer this question and
cBBkGbZKw_w,4842560,4848400,it's fine if we have to punt to a  different meeting  but with all the attention in the  community on the grandparent permit i
cBBkGbZKw_w,4848400,4854159,was wondering if you have any data  so far you or or rebecca on um you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,4854159,4861280,how many  applications have come in so far  anything that you can uh share about  that program so i'm gonna um you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,4861280,4867760,ask to update you on that later um  because i don't have the exact i believe  that we had over 100 applications
cBBkGbZKw_w,4867760,4875440,already  um you know that's the last that i saw  um it's been uh a busy couple of weeks
cBBkGbZKw_w,4875440,4880639,but um but we know that that the people  that we've reached out to um you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,4880639,4885920,are  applying so  um you know we've we've been assisting i
cBBkGbZKw_w,4885920,4892320,know that there's you know it's a little  bit late in the calendar year than what  we would typically have as our timeline
cBBkGbZKw_w,4892320,4897440,so i know that we've been doing a lot of  work one-on-one with families to get
cBBkGbZKw_w,4897440,4903760,those releases from their school  district so i know that we've really  reached out to try to assist um as much
cBBkGbZKw_w,4903760,4908960,as we can on a one-to-one basis so um  but i do know that um we are not going
cBBkGbZKw_w,4908960,4916400,to be uh in short supply of of people  that are interested people are are  completing the applications no i i i
cBBkGbZKw_w,4916400,4922320,even that data point is helpful because  we did do the survey just to see how  many would be interested but the fact  that that many applications actually
cBBkGbZKw_w,4922320,4928320,have already come in is that's what i  was curious about  thank you  no problem
cBBkGbZKw_w,4928400,4933679,thank you i agree with a lot of the  comments that uh mr halimi made um i'm  very happy to
cBBkGbZKw_w,4933679,4940080,to think about the director of school  safety position um i'm i'm overjoyed too  about the um particular person who will
cBBkGbZKw_w,4940080,4947120,be involved in that and uh very happy  and he's very qualified also i can say  that i have personally met we had the
cBBkGbZKw_w,4947120,4953520,ability the opportunity to meet a lot of  these incoming  people for the administration and  they're all top-notch and we are just so
cBBkGbZKw_w,4953520,4960080,lucky to have them and i think that it  will really bring a lot of layers of  intelligence and fill a lot of gaps in
cBBkGbZKw_w,4960080,4965920,the school district  and then another point i wanted to make  and it's i i don't know if it was lost
cBBkGbZKw_w,4965920,4972800,on on everyone else but it is ironic  that we celebrate the 50th anniversary  of title ix and then of course we all
cBBkGbZKw_w,4972800,4978080,know that roe versus wayne was  overturned so i just can't help but
cBBkGbZKw_w,4978080,4986760,mention that and i will keep my personal  opinion to myself but wow isn't that  something so thank you for your report
cBBkGbZKw_w,4988159,4993920,um  i would say i think um  thanks for your report i i'm really
cBBkGbZKw_w,4993920,5000239,excited about all of the positive  changes that are happening with the  district and i really want to thank you
cBBkGbZKw_w,5000239,5007040,and the administration for all the hard  work  that  you've put into making this happen i
cBBkGbZKw_w,5007040,5012960,know that all the changes have been a  challenge but  it's just i can feel the positive energy
cBBkGbZKw_w,5012960,5019040,in the district and  with all of the changes that we have on  the horizon and i really look forward to
cBBkGbZKw_w,5019040,5024080,our new uh school year with with these  changes we've met the new
cBBkGbZKw_w,5024080,5030960,people that are coming in  and  of course we're sad to see dave damika  going and that wade is leaving us
cBBkGbZKw_w,5030960,5037280,but um we are excited about the new  people that have come in and um and in
cBBkGbZKw_w,5037280,5045280,particular we're very excited about the  restructuring and the reorganization  of of the district and and what impact
cBBkGbZKw_w,5045280,5052480,that's going to have on our security  program and our construction program and  as well with our with our curriculum i
cBBkGbZKw_w,5052480,5059120,think it's going to be i think we're  going to see really positive changes and  and that dovetailed with coming out of
cBBkGbZKw_w,5059120,5064560,covid i think we should all be  um  coming to the school year after the
cBBkGbZKw_w,5064560,5069600,summer with really positive  attitudes and fresh eyes and looking for
cBBkGbZKw_w,5069600,5075679,a reset with this district and i know  that we're all  all very excited about it and i think
cBBkGbZKw_w,5075679,5081280,that  the community will see that and we'll be  happy to see
cBBkGbZKw_w,5081280,5088080,all the hard work come to  fruition thank you for saying that and i  want to just say that um you know i
cBBkGbZKw_w,5088080,5093120,think that externally  reconfiguration that summer
cBBkGbZKw_w,5093120,5098400,was uh probably the most difficult  summer  of our lives you know from an external
cBBkGbZKw_w,5098400,5104159,perspective and community members being  able to see  that transformation i think this has
cBBkGbZKw_w,5104159,5110320,been equally  as um as tough but on the inside because  there's a lot of internal
cBBkGbZKw_w,5110320,5115679,movement that's happening so i've really  we've pushed staff to go take vacations
cBBkGbZKw_w,5115679,5121199,while um other of us you know we we're  not able to do that this summer but  we'll we'll catch up in another summer
cBBkGbZKw_w,5121199,5128719,but um it's been that much change um and  so we really thank you for the support
cBBkGbZKw_w,5128719,5134880,thank you i would say also the board is  is also having those changes and we've  really um
cBBkGbZKw_w,5134880,5140639,we've also really reorganized in many  ways or just really tried to be more
cBBkGbZKw_w,5140639,5145760,focused and more structured in our  approach and so i think
cBBkGbZKw_w,5145760,5154120,we're going to see those changes as well  if you haven't already started to see  that so i'm looking forward to it
cBBkGbZKw_w,5156560,5160560,okay next up is meeting reports
cBBkGbZKw_w,5162880,5170239,this would be that opportunity um we  talked a little bit about of a structure  change so a change of uh if board
cBBkGbZKw_w,5170239,5176480,members have been attending  any meetings that they would like to  share  people might not realize the community
cBBkGbZKw_w,5176480,5182000,that we don't get the opportunity to  see each other very often and so this is
cBBkGbZKw_w,5182000,5187920,an opportunity if board members have  attended other meetings that they'd like  to share
cBBkGbZKw_w,5189120,5196400,well  uh i had the occasion in the since the  last meeting to attend a cboc meeting
cBBkGbZKw_w,5196400,5201600,and uh the cboc has spent that even  they're talking about their annual auto
cBBkGbZKw_w,5201600,5208560,or their report which they're going to  make to the board tonight so i'm not  going to steal their thunder and i'm  going to let them go ahead with that
cBBkGbZKw_w,5208560,5213920,i had occasion last week to go to the  facilities and construction committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,5213920,5221120,meeting  they were talking about  various issues with construction
cBBkGbZKw_w,5221120,5227360,but the  they should there was a change in the  chairmanship uh howard goldstein has
cBBkGbZKw_w,5227360,5234639,stepped down now and donna triffman has  been selected as the new  chair of the committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,5234719,5241520,and the other and of course the one  thing i want to say about this is that  if you wish to see what's going on many
cBBkGbZKw_w,5241520,5247679,of these meetings are online or you can  see them  live
cBBkGbZKw_w,5247679,5253360,so that you get a better understanding  of what's going on so i just want to  encourage people if they want to see
cBBkGbZKw_w,5253360,5258639,them they can visit the website and see  the meetings live
cBBkGbZKw_w,5258639,5265280,on on cable which  however they show it  one other meeting i attended which was
cBBkGbZKw_w,5265280,5270320,just yesterday was the  health and safety commission
cBBkGbZKw_w,5270320,5276239,it's  usually every month  i am the liaison to that committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,5276239,5282159,i usually report on what's going on  yesterday i talked about the appointment  of mr mead
cBBkGbZKw_w,5282159,5288800,and the new director of  safety i'm going to ask him to come to  the next meeting and introduce himself
cBBkGbZKw_w,5288800,5297360,to the committee and say a few words  so i have to get reach out to him to do  that and also um they usually um and
cBBkGbZKw_w,5297360,5303760,then i  talked a little bit about the parent  conference i mean the grandparent permit  and those are the only two things and
cBBkGbZKw_w,5303760,5309679,they generally will ask questions it's  really fun to go there i enjoy it a lot
cBBkGbZKw_w,5309679,5315840,the other thing is that they usually  will have a recognition of  some member of the community who is goes
cBBkGbZKw_w,5315840,5320960,above and beyond for health and safety  yesterday it was i i had it written down
cBBkGbZKw_w,5320960,5326560,and i can't find the piece of paper uh  mallory smith's mother was there she was
cBBkGbZKw_w,5326560,5334639,being recognized and the person on the  the health and safety was kathy
cBBkGbZKw_w,5334800,5340080,oh boy kathy was the uh presenter  and she was baker kathy baker was the
cBBkGbZKw_w,5340080,5345840,presenter they pick one person each  month and they make somebody the uh  person of interest or the person they'd
cBBkGbZKw_w,5345840,5351920,like to recognize every month so it was  mallory smith's mother yesterday as you
cBBkGbZKw_w,5351920,5357120,all recall she was the young lady who  passed away from  sarah
cBBkGbZKw_w,5357120,5362639,post  cystic fibrosis  and  and this lady has written a book and
cBBkGbZKw_w,5362639,5367920,traveled  extensively  to advocate for children with cystic
cBBkGbZKw_w,5367920,5372960,fibrosis and other  diseases that they can inherit
cBBkGbZKw_w,5372960,5378239,and so  that was basically my report on that  committee and
cBBkGbZKw_w,5378239,5381519,i enjoy going to the meetings
cBBkGbZKw_w,5383760,5389840,uh i didn't go to any committee meetings  so i just wanted to thank my colleague  mrs marquez for going to so many and
cBBkGbZKw_w,5389840,5395678,reporting back to the board  you're amazing thank you
cBBkGbZKw_w,5397520,5403360,i will be reporting on the human  relations committee um upcoming but i  don't have anything to report as of
cBBkGbZKw_w,5403360,5412239,today  um i i attended the uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,5412239,5417600,facilities and construction committee  along with rochelle as well as the cboc
cBBkGbZKw_w,5417600,5424320,meeting so i won't repeat that in  addition uh last month i attended the  finance committee meeting and wade
cBBkGbZKw_w,5424320,5432400,presented the budget to the finance  committee  um  i prior to that i intended a cte
cBBkGbZKw_w,5432400,5438800,advisory committee and i meant to bring  that up the last meeting and the cte um
cBBkGbZKw_w,5438800,5445520,that program is really amazing and  cindy dubin  had an advisory committee meeting she
cBBkGbZKw_w,5445520,5452239,had no margo and i attended as the board  members as well as  she had community members she had people
cBBkGbZKw_w,5452239,5459760,from the chamber of commerce she had um  you know she  she had dr breggy she had rebecca
cBBkGbZKw_w,5459760,5465040,as well as  student services education services
cBBkGbZKw_w,5465040,5470080,and really looking at how to enhance the  different pathways for cte and that
cBBkGbZKw_w,5470080,5476960,program is just really  really developing and really rich in the  different pathways that
cBBkGbZKw_w,5476960,5482560,each of those programs offer  and it was really a think tank to really
cBBkGbZKw_w,5482560,5489920,to reach out to the different groups in  the community and in the city  and businesses to see how we can bring
cBBkGbZKw_w,5489920,5495440,more offerings to those programs and  and you'll hear more about that as we
cBBkGbZKw_w,5495440,5501600,continue to develop that program but  there's great ideas there and i  encourage you all to look into look into
cBBkGbZKw_w,5501600,5507600,those programs can i just mention one  thing about that particular meeting yes  i was uninvited to it because you could
cBBkGbZKw_w,5507600,5512880,only have two people from the board  and i was told that even though i was
cBBkGbZKw_w,5512880,5518960,invited i was not  able to come that's true and rachelle  has been on that committee that advisory
cBBkGbZKw_w,5518960,5524960,committee for many years so that's a  program where  going forward we'll be appointing our
cBBkGbZKw_w,5524960,5530000,committee members too as we get more  organized this year so  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,5530000,5535280,because it is a really important  committee and  important to have board members on it
cBBkGbZKw_w,5535280,5542719,another committee that noah and i  attended is as city liaisons is  to talk about with the city the tk
cBBkGbZKw_w,5542719,5549360,program and how that affects their  preschool program and  we've been working with them
cBBkGbZKw_w,5549360,5556800,just talking about how to develop the  early education program and rt tk  program and the effects of that on the
cBBkGbZKw_w,5556800,5563040,preschool program and the around  services that go around go along with  that and
cBBkGbZKw_w,5563040,5569920,the reality of it is is the work is  really done by the staff and we're  really just there to talk about how we
cBBkGbZKw_w,5569920,5575199,can from a bigger picture level develop  this program with the city
cBBkGbZKw_w,5575199,5581280,long term and and in the short term but  it's really moving along and it's really  exciting
cBBkGbZKw_w,5581280,5586840,and the opportunities for us as a city  partnering with the city are really
cBBkGbZKw_w,5586840,5591520,fantastic and that's all i have to  report
cBBkGbZKw_w,5593840,5601800,okay our next  topic is our next item on the agenda is  the cboc report

cBBkGbZKw_w,5655920,5659840,it crashed just as soon as i got up
cBBkGbZKw_w,5662960,5666400,no i'm pulling it back up here we go
cBBkGbZKw_w,5668800,5672198,no i got it
cBBkGbZKw_w,5677280,5683280,okay great  thanks for having us  uh so i'm nathan krueger i am vice chair
cBBkGbZKw_w,5683280,5688960,of the citizens bond oversight committee  which we just call the cboc uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,5688960,5694320,with me i have rich baron who is the  former chair still a member and mark  carroll so thanks
cBBkGbZKw_w,5694320,5699600,uh so we're  well our role is and you know most of  the board understands what we do or the
cBBkGbZKw_w,5699600,5706639,board understands but i think most  people in the community have no clue so  the cboc our role i mean primarily it's
cBBkGbZKw_w,5706639,5713280,a fairly narrow objective  there's a huge bond measure passed and  our role is really to provide oversight
cBBkGbZKw_w,5713280,5720480,to ensure that those bond funds are  spent on what they were intended for  which is construction and remodeling of
cBBkGbZKw_w,5720480,5726800,schools i'd say secondarily the  objective is to  just help provide transparency to the
cBBkGbZKw_w,5726800,5733920,community about what's going on these  projects they're big hairy projects i  mean even bond managers have a hard time
cBBkGbZKw_w,5733920,5740400,managing the bond so it's even it's hard  for us as well so our role here is just  to highlight some of the observations
cBBkGbZKw_w,5740400,5746000,we've had over the past year  and uh just provide transparency so the
cBBkGbZKw_w,5746000,5753199,report this is a report i don't have a  beautiful powerpoint presentation like  you dr brady it's hard to put a bond
cBBkGbZKw_w,5753199,5759679,oversight into pretty pictures  it's mostly just excel spreadsheets but  i'll scroll down
cBBkGbZKw_w,5759679,5767040,oh here we go so our report is just  broken up into two sections  the first section uh we just summarize
cBBkGbZKw_w,5767040,5773760,the mos adams and moss levy reports the  auditor is our right hand i mean they  really know
cBBkGbZKw_w,5773760,5780080,like they know the business they dig in  deep to the weeds so we rely really you  guys the board relies heavily on their
cBBkGbZKw_w,5780080,5785360,observations and their recommendations  and on top of that there's observations  that we have throughout the year through
cBBkGbZKw_w,5785360,5792400,various interactions with the bond  manager and the the larger team so the  second section of this report is our
cBBkGbZKw_w,5792400,5798560,direct uh observations so you guys have  been presented the audit i nobody wants
cBBkGbZKw_w,5798560,5804400,to go through another audit again but in  the spirit of just sharing with the  community i'll highlight a couple
cBBkGbZKw_w,5804400,5811119,observations which i encourage the board  to just stay on top of as we especially  as we transition into a new bond manager
cBBkGbZKw_w,5811119,5817199,so i will just scroll quickly down  any other things i should highlight  before we we dig in and just the
cBBkGbZKw_w,5817199,5823440,timeline  the time oh yeah to be clear uh this is  the challenge with the citizens bond
cBBkGbZKw_w,5823440,5829119,oversight committee  we're looking at things that happened  literally a year ago it's water under
cBBkGbZKw_w,5829119,5836560,the bridge we're looking back to ensure  that we didn't mess up now like the the  construction committee they get to look
cBBkGbZKw_w,5836560,5842080,forward which frankly i can't wait to be  on that committee someday  so
cBBkGbZKw_w,5842080,5847840,so this is basically the fiscal year  ending june 30th 2021 so this is a while
cBBkGbZKw_w,5847840,5854480,back but the learnings are valuable you  know history we don't want to repeat the  same uh errors so i'll just highlight
cBBkGbZKw_w,5854480,5860080,two observations from the moss adams  report the two that we thought were the  most important and it's the first is
cBBkGbZKw_w,5860080,5867280,observation 4c which relates to  expenditures and payment procedures i  did talk about this very briefly last
cBBkGbZKw_w,5867280,5874960,month  but we just have to stay on top of it  the challenge is pro west as you guys  know the contractor they would bill the
cBBkGbZKw_w,5874960,5880800,district  and we would pay these bills but part of  those bills were the subcontractor bills
cBBkGbZKw_w,5880800,5887280,there was no documentation of the  subcontractor bills and so we're just  taking pro west at their word that every
cBBkGbZKw_w,5887280,5893040,bill we pay is within contract so moss  adams very clearly called this out that
cBBkGbZKw_w,5893040,5898080,we we're not sure if this is the true  cost and thank you for the board for
cBBkGbZKw_w,5898080,5906480,approving additional audits because  there was about 2.9 million dollars in  savings discovered from b1b2 so and it
cBBkGbZKw_w,5906480,5913600,sounds like we're moving onto a b3  before an el rodeo audit so i think as  we move into a new uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,5913600,5919600,bond manager  we just have to make sure these  protocols are being followed so let's  stay on top of that
cBBkGbZKw_w,5919600,5928000,uh the next stop the next observation  and the last one i'll highlight is  observation 10 and this is on page four
cBBkGbZKw_w,5928000,5933040,around procurement fraud and prevention  i i've worked on large uh construction
cBBkGbZKw_w,5933040,5938320,projects with procurement there's so  many invoices so many orders cement and
cBBkGbZKw_w,5938320,5944080,steel and there's so much opportunity  for fraud there's so many people  involved and there really has not been a
cBBkGbZKw_w,5944080,5950400,robust system of fraud prevention at all  so moss adams has called this out and  the district has even acknowledged like
cBBkGbZKw_w,5950400,5956960,we need to have true practical  mechanisms in place to detect detect  fraud one of which the idea was a
cBBkGbZKw_w,5956960,5962239,hotline or an email that's people on the  ground can can call to to report and
cBBkGbZKw_w,5962239,5967760,then we have to follow up i mean we have  120 million dollar shortfall every
cBBkGbZKw_w,5967760,5974400,dollar we can fight back for and prevent  loss is a dollar that we need so that  was the other observation that uh i
cBBkGbZKw_w,5974400,5980560,would say that we just need to stay on  top of so  i guess i don't know  we have a 1-800 number in the works
cBBkGbZKw_w,5980560,5987040,hopefully  all right so i'll just move on to a  couple comments directly from the cboc
cBBkGbZKw_w,5987040,5994320,and i'll uh we'll just tag team with the  rest of us  so  the the first one else and
cBBkGbZKw_w,5994320,6002639,moss adams did highlight this to some  extent but during the period of the  audit  there was no uh there was no staffing
cBBkGbZKw_w,6002639,6011600,plan for the bond manager and i've  highlighted this in many cboc meetings  so tcds they were able to just freely
cBBkGbZKw_w,6011600,6017920,give raises to staff and uh there was  other aspects of staffing and uh the
cBBkGbZKw_w,6017920,6023520,labor costs are  theoretically creeping up but there is  no oversight for the board no approval
cBBkGbZKw_w,6023520,6030880,by the board to  allow the growth of staff of costs by  tcds so thankfully we're transitioning
cBBkGbZKw_w,6030880,6037360,to a new bond manager my understanding  is we do have a new staffing plan but  this is something this was called up by
cBBkGbZKw_w,6037360,6043520,moss adams for four years there was no  staffing plan according to the moss  adams report so this is something that
cBBkGbZKw_w,6043520,6051119,we just need to stay on top of to just  keep labor costs down for the bond  manager so uh i guess i'll transition to
cBBkGbZKw_w,6051119,6057040,our next observation  hi i'm mark carroll um
cBBkGbZKw_w,6057040,6062560,i'm gonna do items two and three the  second one i feel like um because this
cBBkGbZKw_w,6062560,6068400,is dealing with  the year ending in 2021 i feel like  we're a step behind but that's
cBBkGbZKw_w,6068400,6074000,unfortunately what we have to deal with  uh having a an audit be a year out and
cBBkGbZKw_w,6074000,6081920,so  as dr bregge was talking about the new  security program  and hiring uh mark mead
cBBkGbZKw_w,6081920,6088880,the new director of school safety to  increase transparency uh one of the  things we noticed from a year back is
cBBkGbZKw_w,6088880,6094000,uh there was no rfp or transparency for  the new security program
cBBkGbZKw_w,6094000,6100480,the cboc was concerned with  how the contract was given out
cBBkGbZKw_w,6100480,6106080,and  whether  an additional work was given uh not only
cBBkGbZKw_w,6106080,6112639,not through the rfp process  uh but the vendor wasn't a security  security provider so the contract
cBBkGbZKw_w,6112639,6119199,initially planned for three million  dollars but ultimately the cost was 12  million dollars and
cBBkGbZKw_w,6119199,6125040,the idea was to design proprietary  software for the district but because  there was no rfp there was no
cBBkGbZKw_w,6125040,6130320,question uh brought up and no argument  made for why we needed proprietary
cBBkGbZKw_w,6130320,6136560,software versus off-the-shelf software  and so what we're asking is for the
cBBkGbZKw_w,6136560,6143520,district to  um  review the security program and not just
cBBkGbZKw_w,6143520,6148800,what we have now but how it originated  how it was spent and how it was  developed
cBBkGbZKw_w,6148800,6154239,so that we can determine whether the  product should have been conducted using  bond funds and examine why the cost of
cBBkGbZKw_w,6154239,6162320,the project grew so much  the next item  is the
cBBkGbZKw_w,6162320,6167840,we were convinced uh after looking at  the audits  that the district uh has insufficient
cBBkGbZKw_w,6167840,6174239,senior staff  uh in place to oversee the bond program  which is massive as nathan said it's a
cBBkGbZKw_w,6174239,6181840,big hairy project  big hairy beast i think was yes it was  his term and so we needed someone to
cBBkGbZKw_w,6181840,6187840,tame the beast uh and staff  did not exist at that high level who
cBBkGbZKw_w,6187840,6194560,could uh keep an eye on it and  understand it  and  we as we understand
cBBkGbZKw_w,6194560,6200560,the  process was very opaque the district had  has not had not hired senior staff with
cBBkGbZKw_w,6200560,6206800,experience overseeing construction  projects  security overseeing other key aspects of  the project to make sure everything was
cBBkGbZKw_w,6206800,6213520,handled appropriately  and  we understand the bond manager reported  directly to the board of education
cBBkGbZKw_w,6213520,6220560,so  no offense to the board of education but  you're not experts in construction  oversight and
cBBkGbZKw_w,6220560,6225600,pardon me  well
cBBkGbZKw_w,6225600,6231679,so um  not only is this program a multi-year
cBBkGbZKw_w,6231679,6237119,complex project  um out but staff wasn't involved in it  and so
cBBkGbZKw_w,6237119,6242239,we recommend the district hire  experienced and knowledgeable senior  staff to provide adequate oversight of
cBBkGbZKw_w,6242239,6248800,the bond manager and the entire  construction program  going forward to review and make  recommendations to the superintendent
cBBkGbZKw_w,6248800,6254480,and we understand that that is the  process that is going on so um while
cBBkGbZKw_w,6254480,6260560,we're looking back a year and we're  making this recommendation dr bregge is  now catching up with what we caught up
cBBkGbZKw_w,6260560,6267280,with and we appreciate that  and we hope that just like the security  program there will be others hired to
cBBkGbZKw_w,6267280,6271360,oversee other aspects of this project as  well
cBBkGbZKw_w,6273280,6278560,okay great we're almost done we have two  more observations  uh and while i'm scrolling down to the
cBBkGbZKw_w,6278560,6283760,next one what i'll say is you know the  role of the cboc  we criticize i mean that's just we were
cBBkGbZKw_w,6283760,6290239,supposed to find holes and find errors  and but what i'll say is the reality is  there's been a lot of success my
cBBkGbZKw_w,6290239,6297760,daughter is a ninth grader she she's in  b1 and b2 which is finished and she  raves about it so it's beautiful but we
cBBkGbZKw_w,6297760,6303520,need to celebrate that and get out into  the community but also just have greater  transparency with the community and that
cBBkGbZKw_w,6303520,6308560,really relates to our fourth observation  there we need more the the district
cBBkGbZKw_w,6308560,6314800,needs more proactive outreach  the so many parents asked they ask uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,6314800,6321040,when will it be done when will b4 be  done when will my child benefit why is  there a cost over one
cBBkGbZKw_w,6321040,6327840,people have no idea so our suggestion  especially in the spirit of encouraging  transparency reach out to pta meetings
cBBkGbZKw_w,6327840,6334159,send in an assistant superintendent to  share photos successes timelines um what
cBBkGbZKw_w,6334159,6339199,the budgets are because nobody knows and  when nobody knows it's just rumors and
cBBkGbZKw_w,6339199,6346239,so we try to share that but truly it has  to come from the horse's mouth so that's  why our mis i believe it's mr gomez uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,6346239,6352800,the new assistant superintendent the  hope is that's him  guzman excuse me uh him or uh one of his
cBBkGbZKw_w,6352800,6359360,uh support staff could could be out in  the field and that would be pta meetings  prince  coffees with the principal and so forth
cBBkGbZKw_w,6359360,6364719,so  and just to wrap it up mr barron
cBBkGbZKw_w,6364719,6370239,i'll wrap it up boy i'm so grateful to  have this year really have some
cBBkGbZKw_w,6370239,6377199,major work from these two wonderful  gentlemen because they did most of the  report and i'm very appreciative um the
cBBkGbZKw_w,6377199,6385119,last one  is a last point number five is  comprehensive audit is needed and i know
cBBkGbZKw_w,6385119,6390159,you know nathan i spoke for the you know  first one you know couple weeks ago but
cBBkGbZKw_w,6390159,6397119,it's imperative after  what was revealed in b1b2 that we really
cBBkGbZKw_w,6397119,6403760,spend the money  on audits in making sure that every  dollar is spent appropriately
cBBkGbZKw_w,6403760,6409840,you know for  and you know from our  view not only to catch
cBBkGbZKw_w,6409840,6417840,things but also to make it clear to  everybody involved in the program that  we are actually doing deep dig audits
cBBkGbZKw_w,6417840,6423920,because it keeps people honest keeps  people  maybe questionable things and it's real
cBBkGbZKw_w,6423920,6429679,you know it's prudent and you know we  all want to know that every dollar is  spent
cBBkGbZKw_w,6429679,6435280,appropriately  you know and that's really you know the  theme really we're pushing this year's
cBBkGbZKw_w,6435280,6441520,transparency  and you know  transparency and transparency you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,6441520,6449520,is  these are  every dollar  you know  is the stakeholders money taxpayer money
cBBkGbZKw_w,6449520,6455280,and district money and it's really  imperative  that everybody as a team you know we're
cBBkGbZKw_w,6455280,6460639,we feel we're part of the team  unfortunately we're looking back almost  two years
cBBkGbZKw_w,6460639,6465920,but  it's imperative that it be spent and you  know i do
cBBkGbZKw_w,6465920,6471520,you know i don't need to go through the  recommendations  again but the most
cBBkGbZKw_w,6471520,6478000,you know i want to say is the board this  year  has really taken such a proactive
cBBkGbZKw_w,6478000,6485040,approach and it's appreciated because in  i know in prior reports and i've been on  the cblc six years you know we've gotten
cBBkGbZKw_w,6485040,6492400,pushbacks from boards even  getting a legal opinion on uh  expenditure for
cBBkGbZKw_w,6492400,6500000,you know suing you know metro and you  know really push back and i think the  board really you know my hats off is
cBBkGbZKw_w,6500000,6505199,really trying to take a proactive  approach  to better the program and to do
cBBkGbZKw_w,6505199,6511040,everything to finish it and i think  that's what as a team is we want to make  every
cBBkGbZKw_w,6511040,6517840,make sure every dollar spent and i do  feel you know the board right now you  know is not fighting that is really
cBBkGbZKw_w,6517840,6523199,looking for solutions so you know it's  while we have a lot of
cBBkGbZKw_w,6523199,6529840,you know things we brought up  is you know and i think a lot of this  has been addressed but it's imperative
cBBkGbZKw_w,6529840,6535119,that you know that it be done  because we want this program
cBBkGbZKw_w,6535119,6541040,you know as a  you know community member and  somebody who went through beverly high
cBBkGbZKw_w,6541040,6547679,is and my children went through the  school and started my father  is  we want these buildings done
cBBkGbZKw_w,6547679,6553920,for you know for our grandchildren our  great grandchildren you know and i think  it's important the legacy and it's like
cBBkGbZKw_w,6553920,6560000,the decisions that you guys make today  will go way beyond our lifetime and i
cBBkGbZKw_w,6560000,6566239,think you know that you know i think  it's imperative that we all realize that  it's not just about building a little
cBBkGbZKw_w,6566239,6572719,shed or anything these are these are 200  you know these buildings will be around  another 100 years they better be for
cBBkGbZKw_w,6572719,6578560,what you guys are spending to rebuild  them  so uh but thank you all and um
cBBkGbZKw_w,6578560,6586080,you know and we hope next year you know  will be a quite a bit different with all  these changes and the new bond manager
cBBkGbZKw_w,6586080,6591920,okay anything thank you  if you guys want to just wait we'll have  comments sure
cBBkGbZKw_w,6591920,6598239,michelle  well first of all i want to thank you  all i know that this you are volunteers
cBBkGbZKw_w,6598239,6606239,and the expertise that you provided to  us on this is really wonderful you are  dedicated and i really appreciate
cBBkGbZKw_w,6606239,6614639,everything that you've been doing i've  been attending many of the meetings as  you know  and i i can't thank you enough for the
cBBkGbZKw_w,6614639,6622320,the way that you  go after the job and what you've been  assigned to do you really  are you're really doing a great job uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,6622320,6627840,just one comment that i might  say there was i read the report before
cBBkGbZKw_w,6627840,6634480,and it said that out of the nine items  there were  um  six that were left open but i only saw
cBBkGbZKw_w,6634480,6641199,five here i wondered if there was a  reason what what did you i don't know  what if there was something that was  just not significant or whatever but out
cBBkGbZKw_w,6641199,6647040,of the moss adams audit you're  referencing you mentioned that there  were nine  i saw six i didn't know what that was i
cBBkGbZKw_w,6647040,6652480,thought maybe  i'll have to go back and double check  potentially
cBBkGbZKw_w,6652480,6659280,and i would like to make a comment about  one that i totally agree with you on i  mean i agree with you on everything but
cBBkGbZKw_w,6659280,6666239,the one about the transparency to the  community i got an email  this week from a lady who lives across
cBBkGbZKw_w,6666239,6671520,the street from the high school with the  question  they're tired of seeing uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,6671520,6677119,whatever did you get the email also am i  the only one that got it  well
cBBkGbZKw_w,6677119,6682480,i don't know why but  she was complaining when is it going to  be finished when is it going to be
cBBkGbZKw_w,6682480,6689040,finished and and i you know i don't know  what to answer her i don't have the  answer and and yet i feel like she needs
cBBkGbZKw_w,6689040,6695440,an answer she needs to have to know and  we need to reach out to the community  because i i did i started to respond to
cBBkGbZKw_w,6695440,6700560,her and i thought gee i don't know what  it's going i can't say anything to her i  don't know and yet it's disappointing
cBBkGbZKw_w,6700560,6706080,that i can't you know i i supposedly i  know about el rodeo now that i mean that
cBBkGbZKw_w,6706080,6711199,i know but she she and she then she made  some other things about the cars and so
cBBkGbZKw_w,6711199,6716960,on and so forth and  and uh  it's really too bad that the community
cBBkGbZKw_w,6716960,6723679,doesn't know a little bit more about  when things can be done and be kept up  to breath up to speed on it and i think
cBBkGbZKw_w,6723679,6730800,that would do a lot for our pr  if we could have something like that and  you bring that out in this whole thing
cBBkGbZKw_w,6730800,6736719,uh on one of your recommendations so i  really appreciate that and i agree with  you on that one
cBBkGbZKw_w,6736719,6743440,and again  thank you for all your hard work we  really appreciate it
cBBkGbZKw_w,6743840,6749040,i agree with all the comments of my  colleague uh  nathan mark rich and your whole
cBBkGbZKw_w,6749040,6755280,committee really thank you guys so much  for being great um you know  servants of the public and the school
cBBkGbZKw_w,6755280,6761599,district you guys put in  a lot of work here um and i  i just agree with your report and i
cBBkGbZKw_w,6761599,6768400,really appreciate you guys are  you know looking  quite a you know quite far back in the  rearview mirror where we're looking a
cBBkGbZKw_w,6768400,6776159,year back that's not because you guys  made a decision to do it that way that's  your mandate  um but you know as we're talking about
cBBkGbZKw_w,6776159,6783119,things like you know the need to make  changes to the security program and  having a better staffing plan and  proactive i mean all the findings that
cBBkGbZKw_w,6783119,6788560,you guys are pointing out are things  that also this board has been discussing  and we've been concerned about and you
cBBkGbZKw_w,6788560,6793760,know we've been talking to staff about  and i think for the community listening  i think that
cBBkGbZKw_w,6793760,6799199,you know we should feel good that this  ship is getting rated we are we are
cBBkGbZKw_w,6799199,6805119,turning this ship we are moving in the  right direction and i appreciate you  know you guys for
cBBkGbZKw_w,6805119,6812400,pointing out the issues that you have  pointed out making the recommendations  that you're making  um there is consistency between all the
cBBkGbZKw_w,6812400,6818960,things that we're talking around around  and we're using the same words around  transparency and opaqueness and you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,6818960,6825119,needing to bring things into the light  and um i i really appreciate this  partnership how we're all how we're all
cBBkGbZKw_w,6825119,6831360,working together and i do hope the next  time we get a cboc report it's gonna  it's gonna be very different than the
cBBkGbZKw_w,6831360,6836400,one that we're uh  reading uh tonight um so thank you for  being here thank you for presenting and
cBBkGbZKw_w,6836400,6841760,for all the work you guys have done of  course thank you  um nathan mark and rich and the rest of
cBBkGbZKw_w,6841760,6847679,the cboc committee thank you so much  really for your insights and if i could  just say a hundred percent that's what i
cBBkGbZKw_w,6847679,6854239,would just like to say 100 i mean the  observations you have make a lot of  sense and i can assure you that um a lot
cBBkGbZKw_w,6854239,6862320,of them have been um and are currently  being remedied uh but they're very  important uh to point out and also um i
cBBkGbZKw_w,6862320,6868239,i think you're right b1 and b2 are  are beautiful and there's a lot of  happiness that has come from it and that
cBBkGbZKw_w,6868239,6874239,is there is some success but there's a  long way to go and i think that um  you know having a new management
cBBkGbZKw_w,6874239,6880239,structure for you know the reporting you  know whoever the bond manager  reports to and a bunch of different
cBBkGbZKw_w,6880239,6886000,changes are really going to right the  ship as mr halimi said so thank you for  your commitment and all of your insights
cBBkGbZKw_w,6886000,6892560,and um absolutely thank you chris thank  you  well thank you so much for your report
cBBkGbZKw_w,6892560,6900000,um one i just would like to say i expect  we'll see the same report next year  since we are at the end of this year and
cBBkGbZKw_w,6900000,6906239,we haven't made these changes as of yet  so two more days in this fiscal year and  then we i won't be surprised if we see
cBBkGbZKw_w,6906239,6913280,the same report next year but the year  after that i expect to see a completely  different report from you and um but i
cBBkGbZKw_w,6913280,6918639,do find that uh  it is very um reassuring to hear your
cBBkGbZKw_w,6918639,6925040,comments because they do  they do reinforce the changes that we're  making right now or already have made
cBBkGbZKw_w,6925040,6931040,and  i think that  we have restructured i think the board  has acknowledged that
cBBkGbZKw_w,6931040,6936159,right away that this was not a  functional way of having the reporting
cBBkGbZKw_w,6936159,6942159,structure so that's that change has been  made and  we've put in a district
cBBkGbZKw_w,6942159,6947840,employee that has that expertise in  construction we've approved that  position and we'll be interviewing for
cBBkGbZKw_w,6947840,6953280,that position  um  within days and that that application uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,6953280,6959119,timeline that application window's  already closed so we have applicants to  interview and we're really looking
cBBkGbZKw_w,6959119,6965280,forward to that  um i think as well from a staffing plan  i think this board
cBBkGbZKw_w,6965280,6971040,already had seen what those increases  were we we found those increases and saw
cBBkGbZKw_w,6971040,6976080,that how important that staffing plan is  and one thing that i would say has
cBBkGbZKw_w,6976080,6984000,having been a cboc member  is even though the district made so many  strides in so many ways um each report
cBBkGbZKw_w,6984000,6990400,we would see that there were  improvements  these items that you're pointing out  have always been on here
cBBkGbZKw_w,6990400,6997040,and and that's what you're showing from  2016 to 2021 these are yeah i mean  exactly like with the staffing or the
cBBkGbZKw_w,6997040,7003199,issue with uh  yeah the staffing plan i think it was  for four years right and you'll see it  right there on page three and four right
cBBkGbZKw_w,7003199,7009280,and the backup for the payouts and um  these items have been called out and  they're important items and we've seen
cBBkGbZKw_w,7009280,7014800,that now with the construction audit  report and how important these things  are and i think it's really
cBBkGbZKw_w,7014800,7020880,great that now that we as a board and as  a district are addressing these items  because these are really important items
cBBkGbZKw_w,7020880,7025920,especially for our ability to have  oversight and to manage this program and
cBBkGbZKw_w,7025920,7030960,i would really hope that in a year from  now  uh after
cBBkGbZKw_w,7030960,7036400,not next year but the year after that  when we see the cboc report we're not  going to see these on here
cBBkGbZKw_w,7036400,7042000,and that hopefully if we do see things  on here i'm sure there'll be something  new or what have you but it's not going
cBBkGbZKw_w,7042000,7047760,going to be these items anymore and that  we've moved beyond that and that we're  going to have better control and
cBBkGbZKw_w,7047760,7053360,transparency on this program and we're  going to see better reporting because  that was another thing that when i was
cBBkGbZKw_w,7053360,7059040,on the cboc that we always talked about  is we don't have a budget or a schedule  and we're not getting that type of
cBBkGbZKw_w,7059040,7064719,reporting as a cboc and we expanded the  audit so that we could get that and and
cBBkGbZKw_w,7064719,7071440,again that's on the report and  and an update on the master plan so i'm  really looking forward to the changes
cBBkGbZKw_w,7071440,7077599,that that we've all made and i'm really  happy to see  all the work that you have done and the
cBBkGbZKw_w,7077599,7083280,report that you did and that it aligns  with with the changes that we're making  so thank you for all of your work and
cBBkGbZKw_w,7083280,7089920,and and  and being willing to come up in public  and speak  about that in public because i know
cBBkGbZKw_w,7089920,7095440,that's not always easy  um and i appreciate your honesty
cBBkGbZKw_w,7095440,7101520,great thank you thank you  nothing further for me but  thank you for your report and i always

cBBkGbZKw_w,7423040,7428719,that there's as little delay as possible  to go forward  so i just like to make those comments
cBBkGbZKw_w,7428719,7434560,and  i want to thank the committee for the  work that they did  to find
cBBkGbZKw_w,7434560,7437840,a new bond manager
cBBkGbZKw_w,7439599,7446960,it's sort of poetic that we're voting on  this right after the cvoc report um  i really want to thank uh the entire
cBBkGbZKw_w,7446960,7452239,committee that worked on this um  especially i want to thank my colleagues  on the board as well
cBBkGbZKw_w,7452239,7458639,uh for the work that they did kind of  going through all these interviews um  but i want to call out president wells
cBBkGbZKw_w,7458639,7464400,for her leadership here i mean this was  a lot of  work from identifying and coming to the
cBBkGbZKw_w,7464400,7471840,conclusion that uh you know we needed a  new uh to bond manager um you know uh at
cBBkGbZKw_w,7471840,7477040,the president wells really helped  champion this i also want to thank wade  i want to thank dr breggy this is a lot
cBBkGbZKw_w,7477040,7482960,of work and we're sitting here at june  28th and we're selecting  a new bond manager and we have a new
cBBkGbZKw_w,7482960,7490079,structure that we're putting in place  and you know we've we've accomplished a  lot in a relatively short period of time
cBBkGbZKw_w,7490079,7495119,right in the ship and i'm just i'm  grateful  uh because i'm sitting up here and i
cBBkGbZKw_w,7495119,7500639,made some of the decisions to put this  in motion but it was  tens if not hundreds of hours of work
cBBkGbZKw_w,7500639,7507040,that went into actually  getting here uh which i which i didn't  which i'm not responsible for it was
cBBkGbZKw_w,7507040,7513920,really the staff and my colleagues on  the board so i really want to thank you  guys for all the work that went into  this thank you

cBBkGbZKw_w,7537119,7544400,um  and i would say also i think it's fair  to say that as a result of going through  the rfp and rfq process that the
cBBkGbZKw_w,7544400,7551599,district will be paying nearly half the  fees that we paid tcds  and that for the same services
cBBkGbZKw_w,7551599,7557199,and that  we will probably end up saving the  districts in the millions of dollars
cBBkGbZKw_w,7557199,7565119,and for the people in the community that  have been wondering and asking  yes fonder solari is licensed and meets
cBBkGbZKw_w,7565119,7571599,the requirements for government code  4525  i don't have any other comments
cBBkGbZKw_w,7571599,7578079,one additional comment for the board  this is a a  women's owned firm
cBBkGbZKw_w,7578079,7581679,yeah which is another great thing

cBBkGbZKw_w,7604400,7609960,oh thank you  probably
cBBkGbZKw_w,7622880,7627599,oh  good job here we go
cBBkGbZKw_w,7627920,7633280,president wells members of the board  before i jump into this presentation  this is the approval of the adopted
cBBkGbZKw_w,7633280,7638639,budget for 2223.  as you all know by july 1st each year
cBBkGbZKw_w,7638639,7644400,all school school districts in the state  of california have to approve a budget  for the next fiscal year
cBBkGbZKw_w,7644400,7649520,in that budget you have to show two  things you have to show  fiscal solvency meaning that you have a
cBBkGbZKw_w,7649520,7656639,sufficient reserve level and you have  enough cash to operate your school  district not only for 22 23 but for the
cBBkGbZKw_w,7656639,7662960,next two fiscal years and i can tell you  tonight that the budget you adopt  tonight shows fiscal solvency and it
cBBkGbZKw_w,7662960,7668079,shows sufficient cash to operate next  year in the next two years  however i'm going to tell you that as
cBBkGbZKw_w,7668079,7675520,soon as you adopt this budget i'm going  to start changing it and i'm going to  tell you why right  now reason is really because the state
cBBkGbZKw_w,7675520,7682320,just came out with their budget it's not  even adopted yet and it's got lots of  changes there's lots of money coming to
cBBkGbZKw_w,7682320,7688000,school districts even first community  funded districts  a couple weeks ago we thought a lot of
cBBkGbZKw_w,7688000,7693520,it would be in a discretionary block  grant we just learned yesterday that  we're going to get a few more
cBBkGbZKw_w,7693520,7699599,categorical type programs that are more  directed we're still working through all  those nuances
cBBkGbZKw_w,7699599,7706239,so what's going to happen is in about at  the july 12 board meeting i'm going to  bring some information back to the board
cBBkGbZKw_w,7706239,7712239,with an update of these budget numbers  for next year it's called a 45 day  update  and it's something that we need to show
cBBkGbZKw_w,7712239,7717840,to the board because this budget you're  going to adopt tonight has none of this  new state funding in it so it's
cBBkGbZKw_w,7717840,7722960,important that the the board of nurse  stands out and the community understands  that but i want to go through this
cBBkGbZKw_w,7722960,7729440,report pretty fast and and highlight a  couple of notes about the budget a big  thank you to the cabinet and the fiscal
cBBkGbZKw_w,7729440,7735040,team we can't prepare this budget  without all of these guys and as we  prepare the budget we look at the local
cBBkGbZKw_w,7735040,7741119,control accountability plan the  strategic plan of the board  we always look at staffing and other
cBBkGbZKw_w,7741119,7747119,contingencies so all of these things and  all these people helped develop this  budget
cBBkGbZKw_w,7747119,7752239,really briefly these are the estimated  actuals for the current year 2122
cBBkGbZKw_w,7752239,7757360,and the adopted budget for 22.23  you can see their beginning fund balance
cBBkGbZKw_w,7757360,7763520,you can see the revenues coming in  the expenses broken out  by category
cBBkGbZKw_w,7763520,7768800,and then you can see at the bottom and i  just want to highlight a couple things  next year's budget for the first time in
cBBkGbZKw_w,7768800,7775360,this district's history general fund  budget will exceed 90 million dollars  it's 92 million it'll be more than that
cBBkGbZKw_w,7775360,7783280,in 45 days when i update update the  budget additionally our expenditures per  student are now going to exceed 30 000
cBBkGbZKw_w,7783280,7789679,per student based on what we know now  and that's going to actually go up too  when we adjust the budget so those are
cBBkGbZKw_w,7789679,7796400,really impressive numbers and numbers  you can take out to the community as you  talk about the general fund budget
cBBkGbZKw_w,7797599,7803520,another thing we want to highlight we've  had a lot of conversations about  enrollment so when you look at the year
cBBkGbZKw_w,7803520,7810719,the the first covered year 1920 if you  will our enrollment was about 3 500  students
cBBkGbZKw_w,7810719,7816719,the current year enrollment 2122 is  about 31.50  the projection next year
cBBkGbZKw_w,7816719,7822560,without grandparent permits is just over  3 000. so these numbers do not include
cBBkGbZKw_w,7822560,7827840,possible grandparent permits and i just  want folks that  look at this this report to understand
cBBkGbZKw_w,7827840,7833040,that these numbers are going to  fluctuate over the next few months over  the summer as we incorporate maybe these
cBBkGbZKw_w,7833040,7839920,permits and maybe other folks move into  the district so but you can see there  there's been a a drop in enrollment in
cBBkGbZKw_w,7839920,7845119,the school district and that was part of  the discussion around grandparent  permits
cBBkGbZKw_w,7845840,7851280,staffing this is a unique slide because  basically next year our staffing is
cBBkGbZKw_w,7851280,7856800,going to be exactly the same as it was  in 1920. i know the board has talked  about we've added some critical
cBBkGbZKw_w,7856800,7861840,positions over the last  uh couple of months that we needed we  had some gaps
cBBkGbZKw_w,7861840,7869280,uh in some positions but when you look  over look at our entire staffing we  haven't changed at all from 1920. we're
cBBkGbZKw_w,7869280,7876158,basically the same number of staff when  you look at classified and certificated  staff  okay
cBBkGbZKw_w,7877840,7883199,so even with the addition of the staff  that we've spoken about in the last  couple of months
cBBkGbZKw_w,7883199,7888960,it's interesting to look at this  percentage back in 1920  the percentage of our budget that was
cBBkGbZKw_w,7888960,7896000,related to staffing was 84.2 percent  that actually dropped over the last
cBBkGbZKw_w,7896000,7903280,couple years and now is only 78 percent  so we're below the state average as far  as how much money we devote for staffing
cBBkGbZKw_w,7903280,7911960,and that's important for people to  understand that we're not even at the  state average as far as the amount of  money we devote to staffing
cBBkGbZKw_w,7914719,7919840,so we talked about being a community  funded district basic aid district which  basically means we're funded by our
cBBkGbZKw_w,7919840,7924880,local property taxes you can see that  here on this slide
cBBkGbZKw_w,7924880,7931119,this is the trend analysis of our  property tax you can see back in 2021
cBBkGbZKw_w,7931119,7939880,uh  the amount we collected was about 55.1  million  uh projected in 21 2223
cBBkGbZKw_w,7939880,7946480,61.7 million  and then out in 2425 66.9 million so you
cBBkGbZKw_w,7946480,7953000,see these increases each year somewhere  between four and five percent
cBBkGbZKw_w,7954000,7959840,you can see here the big orange this is  for beverly hills high school that big  orange represents the amount that we get
cBBkGbZKw_w,7959840,7966400,from property taxes  and you can see in blue  the amount we get from
cBBkGbZKw_w,7966400,7971520,local and that's the city of beverly  hills jpa and other gifts and donations
cBBkGbZKw_w,7971520,7977679,and then the the measly amount we get  from the federal government of about  four million dollars
cBBkGbZKw_w,7979599,7984960,expense wise look at the orange green  and purple  we are our biggest asset are our
cBBkGbZKw_w,7984960,7990639,employees you can see there that  certificated salaries benefits  classified salaries make up the lion's
cBBkGbZKw_w,7990639,7997520,share  of our expense budget in the general  fund  the the yellow slice is really our other
cBBkGbZKw_w,7997520,8004000,services in that yellow slice of the pie  you have things like utilities and  insurance
cBBkGbZKw_w,8004000,8012159,legal fees things like that  and then the smaller slice the  blue size is instructional materials
cBBkGbZKw_w,8012159,8019280,okay  here i've just included all the other  funds that we deal with when we adopt a
cBBkGbZKw_w,8019280,8024880,budget  uh fund eight student activity that's  new for this year during the course of
cBBkGbZKw_w,8024880,8030560,2223 we're going to add bvms because  they now really have a robust asb
cBBkGbZKw_w,8030560,8036639,so we'll be adding those numbers into  fund 8.  the cafeteria fund is a benefit of
cBBkGbZKw_w,8036639,8043679,fully funding those meal programs and  reimbursables so we're excited to stay  say we no longer have an encroachment
cBBkGbZKw_w,8043679,8049920,from that program so maybe we'll be able  to do some diff some additional things  for for our students
cBBkGbZKw_w,8049920,8056239,in food services  deferred maintenance is the allocation  that the board has made to address those
cBBkGbZKw_w,8056239,8063440,programs  uh fund 21 our courses are general  obligation bonds  to fund 25 developer fees
cBBkGbZKw_w,8063440,8069760,the other two are self-insurance and  then finally the opeb  fund 71. so you can see there
cBBkGbZKw_w,8069760,8075678,that the different  different funds apart from the general  fund
cBBkGbZKw_w,8078079,8083599,as we develop the multi-year projection  as we're required to do when we adopt  the budget we've here are our
cBBkGbZKw_w,8083599,8089760,assumptions we have assumed at this  point that because of declining  enrollment or just tightening of  staffing we're going to lose probably
cBBkGbZKw_w,8089760,8097280,three teachers  in each of the next two years after 2223  so in 23 24 and 24 25 three in each of
cBBkGbZKw_w,8097280,8104880,those years  uh there is still an employee  compensation increase  uh for 22.23 it's two and a half percent
cBBkGbZKw_w,8104880,8110320,23.24 it's two and a half percent and  then we'll be at the end of our contract  and then we'll have to renegotiate
cBBkGbZKw_w,8110320,8116400,employee compensation  uh there you see the property tax growth  percentages and this these numbers
cBBkGbZKw_w,8116400,8121440,assume and it's important to note this  that the jpa
cBBkGbZKw_w,8121440,8127040,amount continues at 11.5 million dollars  remember this is the last year 2223 of
cBBkGbZKw_w,8127040,8134880,our jpa and we're going back into  negotiations with the city but for our  multi-year projections it does include
cBBkGbZKw_w,8134880,8141760,the assumption that we're still going to  get 11.5 million dollars from the city  of beverly hills
cBBkGbZKw_w,8144159,8151440,so this is your  next year's adopted budget in the next  two years  as i said at our study session i know
cBBkGbZKw_w,8151440,8157040,everyone looks at that operational loss  of 3.1 million it's not going to be that  much
cBBkGbZKw_w,8157040,8164400,uh once we add in the state funding so i  just want to assure people  that it's not going to be that high
cBBkGbZKw_w,8164400,8169440,that  our reserve is most likely going to stay  over 30 percent
cBBkGbZKw_w,8169440,8174719,for the next three years  finally some thoughts we talked about
cBBkGbZKw_w,8174719,8182079,grandparent permits  even with grandparent permits there  still may be some reduction in  enrollment over the next few years
cBBkGbZKw_w,8182079,8187280,um  i think uh with the new assistant  supernova internet of business coming on
cBBkGbZKw_w,8187280,8192319,board i'm gonna give him some work  um we probably need to look at our our
cBBkGbZKw_w,8192319,8198478,insurance  coverages  because those premiums continue to rise
cBBkGbZKw_w,8198478,8204478,so there's opportunities to look at  other options for insurance both  property and liability and
cBBkGbZKw_w,8204478,8210240,health and welfare for our employees  so it's probably a good time to look  into those
cBBkGbZKw_w,8210240,8216080,we've talked about the shortfall in our  building program  we'll need to look at applying for
cBBkGbZKw_w,8216080,8223280,additional state grants and funding in  the new state budget there's some  additional funds for building and  construction so that's a good sign
cBBkGbZKw_w,8223280,8228719,we'll need to talk about certificates of  participation joint ventures  ground leases we're looking at ground
cBBkGbZKw_w,8228719,8233920,lease opportunities for the district  and no one jump out of your chair i just
cBBkGbZKw_w,8233920,8240960,wanted to do some analysis on purple  parcel taxes no one told me to do this  but uh if if the district wanted to do a
cBBkGbZKw_w,8240960,8247598,parcel tax program  assuming a 25 opt out  for a dollar a day you could fund the
cBBkGbZKw_w,8247598,8252960,district security program and that's the  power of a parcel tax  so
cBBkGbZKw_w,8252960,8258719,that's just my uh  as i leave the district i just wanted to  put those numbers in front of you
cBBkGbZKw_w,8258719,8265598,so we have a strong fund balance we have  a strong cash position we're going to  bring that 45 day update to the board in
cBBkGbZKw_w,8265598,8271920,a couple of weeks  and we asked the board to approve  this positive budget
cBBkGbZKw_w,8271920,8276920,tonight  thank you
cBBkGbZKw_w,8277359,8284240,do you have any questions rachel  oh yeah you're right let's do a motion i  will move the approval of the 20 22 23
cBBkGbZKw_w,8284240,8289359,budget oh second  any questions rachelle okay well first
cBBkGbZKw_w,8289359,8296160,of all wade i know that this is the last  time that you all be making a  presentation to us no he'll be back i'll
cBBkGbZKw_w,8296160,8302080,be back  he's on the 12th we're not letting him  carve that until this is balanced
cBBkGbZKw_w,8302080,8307120,i can depend on that he can't leave  until it's bound by right now  you can i will be back on the 12th
cBBkGbZKw_w,8307120,8312240,trusty marcus okay all right then i will  hold my comment for that on the 12th  okay
cBBkGbZKw_w,8312240,8317920,well again  the only thing that i was concerned when  i saw this the first time was that the
cBBkGbZKw_w,8317920,8323359,difference between 89 million and 92  million was the concern of mine and
cBBkGbZKw_w,8323359,8331120,because of the  windfall of four and a half million  dollars which even is better tonight  than it was hopefully we'll be all right
cBBkGbZKw_w,8331120,8338719,for the next year and um and we will not  be operating with the deficit budget so  that was my main concern and i'm
cBBkGbZKw_w,8338719,8346240,grateful for that and uh  uh  interestingly enough that we are um at
cBBkGbZKw_w,8346240,8351518,what was it 73 percent or was it 73  percent uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,8351518,8359040,per the uh  uh with the teachers benefits and the  classified and the other as is only 73
cBBkGbZKw_w,8359040,8364880,of our total budget i found that  interesting you brought that out i found  that that was i thought it was much
cBBkGbZKw_w,8364880,8370558,higher than that but it isn't and again  uh thank you for all your work i really
cBBkGbZKw_w,8370558,8375598,don't have any questions i  i think that it was very informative
cBBkGbZKw_w,8375598,8381920,formative very understandable and  i thank you very much
cBBkGbZKw_w,8382780,8388000,[Music]  thank you wade  first of all just to call out again and
cBBkGbZKw_w,8388000,8393359,emphasize 90 million dollar budget 30  000 per kid that we're spending i mean
cBBkGbZKw_w,8393359,8400880,that that really does  you know rival um some of the top you  know uh to private schools that we we
cBBkGbZKw_w,8400880,8406080,see in our area um the money that's  going uh towards student education so um
cBBkGbZKw_w,8406080,8412720,thank you for calling that out  um  i just wanted to be clear for the  community say because we did make a
cBBkGbZKw_w,8412720,8419920,commitment that we were going to keep 30  reserves this budget that we would be  approving technically would not
cBBkGbZKw_w,8419920,8426240,hit the 30 percent but with the money  that we  expect strongly expect we're going to  get from the state that would put us
cBBkGbZKw_w,8426240,8432880,above the 30 percent again correct so we  expect by the time we do either the  unaudited actuals in september or the
cBBkGbZKw_w,8432880,8439120,official first interim report a  combination of additional state funding  and additional property taxes that have
cBBkGbZKw_w,8439120,8445600,been delayed because of a timing  issue at the county that will be at 30  or more okay great i just wanted to call
cBBkGbZKw_w,8445600,8453760,that out um  one question on the employee  compensation  increase for 24.25 we put
cBBkGbZKw_w,8453760,8459600,zero because we don't have a contract  yet for that but i mean we are expecting  that they're
cBBkGbZKw_w,8459600,8466399,you know we should  phrase differently wouldn't it be more  conservative to just put a placeholder
cBBkGbZKw_w,8466399,8471600,you know in place for that  so once we know what the state budget is
cBBkGbZKw_w,8471600,8477840,we will go back in at first interim  you'll have a an estimate there okay we  don't want to you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,8477840,8484800,show our hand if you will and put four  percent and then  our partners say you said four percent
cBBkGbZKw_w,8484800,8491920,uh but uh yes you're absolutely right  and we should probably they're not gonna  hold us to it he just said four percent
cBBkGbZKw_w,8492399,8499200,and he's going to be gone  yeah  look at that  uh a couple of other quick questions um
cBBkGbZKw_w,8499200,8504880,in terms of like property liability  insurance workers comp are these things  that we've ever explored partnering with
cBBkGbZKw_w,8504880,8511680,like the city on and having like  you know  sort of bundling a contract with them
cBBkGbZKw_w,8511680,8517760,no but that's actually a a good  suggestion to look at that we usually  pool with other school districts because
cBBkGbZKw_w,8517760,8524399,they're like us they have the same  issues that we have  but there's nothing to prevent us from  talking to the city and but they most
cBBkGbZKw_w,8524399,8531279,likely pool with their similar entities  also but it's worth a conversation okay
cBBkGbZKw_w,8531439,8536960,lastly we're expecting a shortfall for  construction
cBBkGbZKw_w,8536960,8543840,is it a  is it a prudent idea should we be  starting to put some money in
cBBkGbZKw_w,8543840,8551439,reserves for that  you know construction program how how  have you been thinking about that
cBBkGbZKw_w,8553040,8558640,if the if after we close the books for  example let's say we have a 33 percent
cBBkGbZKw_w,8558640,8565680,reserve at that time  the board should consider what they want  to do with that delta between 30 and 33
cBBkGbZKw_w,8565680,8572160,and that could be part of that  discussion as far as setting that money  aside to bridge that gap okay
cBBkGbZKw_w,8572160,8577280,all right thank you  thank you wade i mean overall it looks
cBBkGbZKw_w,8577280,8583920,like a positive picture i mean i it's  unfortunate that the enrollment  continues to decline and by what you've
cBBkGbZKw_w,8583920,8590080,said uh  we're down 2.7 percent from  this current school year um
cBBkGbZKw_w,8590080,8595280,but i just had a quick question and that  is um the revenue from jpa which is 11.5
cBBkGbZKw_w,8595280,8600720,million is that unrestricted or  is it what is the expectation of how we
cBBkGbZKw_w,8600720,8606640,use that revenue  yeah it's not really completely  unrestricted that we're supposed to use
cBBkGbZKw_w,8606640,8612560,it to keep our fields in good shape keep  our facilities in good shape make sure  we have proper security make sure we
cBBkGbZKw_w,8612560,8619840,have proper proper maintenance proper  custodians so there is some expectation  and we do set aside a fairly large
cBBkGbZKw_w,8619840,8625318,portion of that to do those various  those those things
cBBkGbZKw_w,8627920,8634319,thank you for all the work wade and i  really appreciate it and i'm really  looking forward to july the 12th um
cBBkGbZKw_w,8634319,8640080,and as well our planning session um i  think we talked originally about having  the revised revise
cBBkGbZKw_w,8640080,8646720,in time for our planning session on the  15th  and i really look forward to at that  point in time also having a little bit a
cBBkGbZKw_w,8646720,8652240,deeper conversation about our  construction program and the security  program and
cBBkGbZKw_w,8652240,8658960,as well um you know looking at this um  looking at this budget a little deeper
cBBkGbZKw_w,8658960,8664160,as well as we're setting uh you know  looking at our priorities for the year
cBBkGbZKw_w,8664160,8670880,um  it's just it's great news to to hear  where we are on the budget though  and um
cBBkGbZKw_w,8670880,8679040,i i think we are going to need to set  aside those reserves for the  construction  um and depending you know what the
cBBkGbZKw_w,8679040,8685200,reports are that we get back with our  new construction team  as well
cBBkGbZKw_w,8685200,8693359,we also have to keep in mind technology  because that's always going to be on a  horizon our our horizon and i think that
cBBkGbZKw_w,8693359,8698720,dave damoca has done such a great job  and  creating that road map for us and we've
cBBkGbZKw_w,8698720,8704960,invested so much to to further develop  that program for us and we need to keep
cBBkGbZKw_w,8704960,8708680,investing in that program
cBBkGbZKw_w,8710000,8716399,anyone have any other questions or  comments all right i will call for the  all those in favor aye aye
cBBkGbZKw_w,8716399,8722720,motion passes 4-0  next item on the agenda
cBBkGbZKw_w,8722720,8728319,um item d team concept development  services staffing plan uh president  wells members of the board this was
cBBkGbZKw_w,8728319,8733680,brought to the board at the last board  meeting  uh but per board direction it was
cBBkGbZKw_w,8733680,8739760,it has now been revised to reflect uh  traditional 40 hours a week work week
cBBkGbZKw_w,8739760,8747600,with the notion if team concepts needs  to work additional hours they will get  pre-approval from district staff
cBBkGbZKw_w,8747600,8753840,great  any questions  rochelle well uh before we do that do we
cBBkGbZKw_w,8753840,8759120,need a motion to approve it you're right  i have a motion to approve team concept
cBBkGbZKw_w,8759120,8764240,development services staffing plan uh i  will second the motion
cBBkGbZKw_w,8764240,8770399,all right  my question wade is if we  do not approve this oh i turned it up if
cBBkGbZKw_w,8770399,8775439,we do not approve this  what happens  um they would bill us for the hours
cBBkGbZKw_w,8775439,8780960,worked under their normal contract under  the old continent under the this
cBBkGbZKw_w,8781760,8788960,as a result of this we are now more in  control of the staffing plan than we  were previous to this right additionally
cBBkGbZKw_w,8788960,8795359,trustee marcus this is to address an  audit finding  so if the board approves it uh this
cBBkGbZKw_w,8795359,8801600,evening i can tell the auditor that the  board approved a staffing plan and if  you approve the next item with the
cBBkGbZKw_w,8801600,8806960,staffing language  at the next audit report i can say that  these items have been addressed by the
cBBkGbZKw_w,8806960,8813040,board of education well i was trying to  find the uh  that on oh i know why it's there it's
cBBkGbZKw_w,8813040,8820840,under the old minutes that's why it says  it's attached but it's under the minutes  of the last meeting
cBBkGbZKw_w,8820840,8826720,okay uh i'll reserve my comments until i  hear from the rest of the board
cBBkGbZKw_w,8827840,8834319,i don't have any comments at this point  i do see that it was reworked and it  seems within the parameters that we said
cBBkGbZKw_w,8834319,8841600,um my comment is i don't see why we have  them on a salaried when we pay them  hourly so from our purposes they're
cBBkGbZKw_w,8841600,8848080,they're not salaried staff they're  hourly staff so i would recommend that  we remove that
cBBkGbZKw_w,8848479,8851840,i spotted that as well
cBBkGbZKw_w,8856240,8864479,president wells can you point to the  area in the  it's in the columns it says um
cBBkGbZKw_w,8864479,8869920,yeah it's the status column the fourth  column  oh okay just change the wording to
cBBkGbZKw_w,8869920,8875600,hourly for uh all the other stuff yeah  oh okay that would that's it if the  board directs we can make that change on
cBBkGbZKw_w,8875600,8882319,the fly okay  okay i would make a um motion then to
cBBkGbZKw_w,8882319,8889120,approve this with that change yes i'll  second that all right  all those in favor aye aye aye motion
cBBkGbZKw_w,8889120,8893640,passes four zero thank you wade
cBBkGbZKw_w,8894880,8901040,so the next item uh e  construction and facilities department  policies and procedures manual update
cBBkGbZKw_w,8901040,8907280,based on board input at the last board  meeting we made some changes to the  language  and i'll just go ahead and read the the
cBBkGbZKw_w,8907280,8912399,language  a staffing plan shall be included in any  agreement for bond construction
cBBkGbZKw_w,8912399,8918800,management services entered into by the  district additionally an annual staffing  plan shall be presented to the district
cBBkGbZKw_w,8918800,8926160,superintendent or designee for budget  planning and verification purposes on or  before april 15th of each year the plan
cBBkGbZKw_w,8926160,8931920,shall include the number of planned  projects and dollar values of planned  projects the staffing plan shall
cBBkGbZKw_w,8931920,8937359,designate whether staff are hourly or  salaried hours charged shall be actual
cBBkGbZKw_w,8937359,8943680,hours worked and shall exclude vacation  sick overtime and holiday time  approved staffing plan may not be
cBBkGbZKw_w,8943680,8949760,amended without prior board approval  president wallace can i make a motion to
cBBkGbZKw_w,8949760,8956000,approve the construction facilities  department policies and procedures  manual update  all second
cBBkGbZKw_w,8956000,8961200,the mission was made by gabe lamey and  seconded by dr stern
cBBkGbZKw_w,8961200,8967760,any questions or comments no just that  i'm glad to see that this has been added  to the policies and clears up the issue
cBBkGbZKw_w,8967760,8972880,that we've had a problem with so i'm  glad to see that
cBBkGbZKw_w,8973439,8979920,uh ditto  i think it's great to have it on the  policies and procedures manual but um
cBBkGbZKw_w,8979920,8985120,one thing i would say about the policies  and procedures manual it's not just  about adding these things to the
cBBkGbZKw_w,8985120,8990800,policies and procedures manual it's  actually about  putting this to work because we have
cBBkGbZKw_w,8990800,8996080,many things in our policies and  procedures manual that don't actually  get put to work so it's great that we're
cBBkGbZKw_w,8996080,9001920,following this and following the  recommendations of the audit but i would  really  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,9001920,9008640,ask all of us to make certain that we  follow through with it  and what that means in terms of the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9008640,9016240,objective is to manage the cost of this  of staffing so  that's my only comment
cBBkGbZKw_w,9017120,9024160,all right i'll call for the all those in  favor aye aye aye aye  motion passes 4-0
cBBkGbZKw_w,9024160,9030479,president wells members of the board  items um f  g h
cBBkGbZKw_w,9030880,9036640,i j and k  are housekeeping resolutions that you  see every year
cBBkGbZKw_w,9036640,9040800,and you may want to consider just taking  them as a slate for
cBBkGbZKw_w,9042439,9050560,approval them all together and approve  them as one  unit and especially items
cBBkGbZKw_w,9050560,9055760,f  through  k
cBBkGbZKw_w,9055920,9062399,i'll second  i have a question on them i did ask it
cBBkGbZKw_w,9062399,9067840,previously um  i know this is just a  possibility we may need them and we may
cBBkGbZKw_w,9067840,9073680,not need them uh do you have any idea  which ones we may need
cBBkGbZKw_w,9073680,9078880,in terms of these resolutions  trustee marcus probably
cBBkGbZKw_w,9078880,9086319,we use all of these really except for uh  item h  and item
cBBkGbZKw_w,9086319,9092240,item g and item h and those are related  to borrowing from the county or  borrowing from a pool
cBBkGbZKw_w,9092240,9098880,and because we have such a strong cash  position we don't need to borrow but  just in case let's just say
cBBkGbZKw_w,9098880,9105359,we don't get any of our property taxes  in december and we needed to then that  would give us that ability right but the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9105359,9110960,rest of the ones we clear the rest of  the ones we use just to get the books  closed and get us started for the next
cBBkGbZKw_w,9110960,9117760,fiscal year thank you i just wanted that  out there for people to know that what  the purpose was
cBBkGbZKw_w,9117760,9125120,any other questions  i'll call for the vote all those in  favor aye aye motion passes 4-0
cBBkGbZKw_w,9125120,9130960,thank you  thank you wade  i  appreciate the suggestion of lumping all
cBBkGbZKw_w,9130960,9138721,this  the next item is  12 technology
cBBkGbZKw_w,9140080,9147680,hello mr damiko good to see you all  good to see you  this is for uh i meant to bring this the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9147680,9153840,last board meeting when we when we  approved the other manage engine product  and we i just accidentally left it off
cBBkGbZKw_w,9153840,9159439,so this is for the manage engine event  log analyzer uh it's part of what we're
cBBkGbZKw_w,9159439,9164800,using to  help us  um have better analytics on who's on our
cBBkGbZKw_w,9164800,9171359,system what activities are happening and  what what the outlier activities are  that might pose a risk so i'll read the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9171359,9176640,rationale the manage event manage engine  event log analyzer will will provide the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9176640,9182000,it department with the centralized  server log system  event log analyzer pulls data from all
cBBkGbZKw_w,9182000,9188399,network equipment into a single pane of  glass  this is a subscription there's no  equipment involved with this and the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9188399,9196760,annual fee for that is six thousand nine  hundred and seventy dollars um it  general funds for fiscal year 2223.
cBBkGbZKw_w,9196960,9204319,i'll make a motion to i'll make a motion  to approve the new agreement with manage  engine zoho corporation
cBBkGbZKw_w,9204319,9209600,oh second the motion was made by mrs  marcus and seconded by mr halimi any
cBBkGbZKw_w,9209600,9216479,questions or comments uh is this  something we used in the past last year  also uh david
cBBkGbZKw_w,9216479,9222800,no these are these are all the manage  engine products and uh the other product  i brought some of the other products i
cBBkGbZKw_w,9222800,9228319,brought at the last board meeting were  part of our security strategic plan to
cBBkGbZKw_w,9228319,9234560,just beef up our i.t security now that  we have  um you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,9234560,9241359,serve a server environment that we can  that we can support with software and  that that is up to date
cBBkGbZKw_w,9241359,9247040,so um so some of these things are new  and  um they are in the budget i shared with
cBBkGbZKw_w,9247040,9253040,you that estimated budget i shared with  you it was part of a line item where i  reserved forty five thousand dollars for
cBBkGbZKw_w,9253040,9260560,fiscal year 2223  we were still putting together  a slate of things that we needed and so
cBBkGbZKw_w,9260560,9266640,um they're not spelled out in line items  on that budget but they're but they're  they're you know they're coming out of
cBBkGbZKw_w,9266640,9273439,that was that money that i um  set aside for security for 2223.
cBBkGbZKw_w,9273439,9281280,thank you thank you  uh  david uh to thank you for bringing this  to us um just uh appreciative that uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,9281280,9289040,we're doing this certainly from a cyber  security standpoint this is a best  practice so i'm glad to see it thanks
cBBkGbZKw_w,9289760,9295760,hi david thank you um just so i can  understand this more concretely when you  say event manager or like an outlier
cBBkGbZKw_w,9295760,9301040,activity what would be like an example  of that because i'm trying to envision  this
cBBkGbZKw_w,9301040,9307200,so when when someone's trying to do bad  stuff you know they might try to
cBBkGbZKw_w,9307200,9313359,penetrate our firewall or get get access  to our file servers or file shares or
cBBkGbZKw_w,9313359,9319520,even  servers that manage our  printers or any other any other
cBBkGbZKw_w,9319520,9326040,infrastructure that servers are  responsible for  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,9328240,9334479,well the servers are responsible for  being tasked to to manage on our network  whether it's managing data or whether
cBBkGbZKw_w,9334479,9341200,it's managing systems and so  um you know there's lots and lots of  transactions most of them are normal
cBBkGbZKw_w,9341200,9347280,they're they're kind of just you know  there's hundreds of them  you know in minutes and so when you look
cBBkGbZKw_w,9347280,9354880,at logs you can't always see  what what the outlier might be and what  this does is it allows us to see uh kind
cBBkGbZKw_w,9354880,9360880,of categorically what's normal what's  kind of like a green yellow red like  what's what's just green what's stuff
cBBkGbZKw_w,9360880,9366880,that's normal it's okay what should we  be paying attention to that might be a  problem and then is there anything that
cBBkGbZKw_w,9366880,9372000,really is a problem  and does any of this monitor student  activity or is this strictly
cBBkGbZKw_w,9372000,9377920,sort of business transactions or or  pro computer protocol transactions
cBBkGbZKw_w,9377920,9385200,yeah it might monitor student activity  when students are saving to the file  shares but not not student internet
cBBkGbZKw_w,9385200,9390640,activity no okay and we have something  else for student activity right like  gaggle or whatever what is it we have
cBBkGbZKw_w,9390640,9397040,other logs that  look for  potential threats and we have logs that
cBBkGbZKw_w,9397040,9402560,show us when students are logging in on  devices and  their ip addresses and other information
cBBkGbZKw_w,9402560,9408960,that  um would allow us to go back if we had  let's say um
cBBkGbZKw_w,9408960,9414880,something happen  um the the bullwhile uh um  uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,9414880,9421280,product that we bought last year for um  ransomware um also monitors
cBBkGbZKw_w,9421280,9426800,all activity um and flags  uh things that happen for example we
cBBkGbZKw_w,9426800,9433120,have a lot of kids in the art classes  that are saving files and sometimes they  save a file with an odd file name
cBBkGbZKw_w,9433120,9438399,and um  bluewall always always flags that
cBBkGbZKw_w,9438399,9445760,it always lets us know that it's  happening and it gives us the option to  you know  react to it um and then
cBBkGbZKw_w,9445760,9453359,you know it's it's built on an ai  platform so it learns and and once it  sort of knows that it's a common thing
cBBkGbZKw_w,9453359,9458479,it it  it still watches but it doesn't doesn't  shut the student's computer down or take
cBBkGbZKw_w,9458479,9464240,them out of active directory well thank  you i think it's good that the lay  people who may be viewing that and
cBBkGbZKw_w,9464240,9469840,parents and kids know that you know  there is monitoring of every single  device potentially and if children or
cBBkGbZKw_w,9469840,9475600,teens are doing things that are untoward  that it potentially could be picked up  so that's good to hear
cBBkGbZKw_w,9475600,9482720,yeah i would just clarify that you know  you're right that's absolutely true and  we you know we we can see what students
cBBkGbZKw_w,9482720,9489760,are doing we you know we can see all of  their history and google but we don't  spy on them no i know that but i mean
cBBkGbZKw_w,9489760,9497600,you know we are guardians um at lightham  so to speak on campus and it's something  that you know should be done thank you

cBBkGbZKw_w,9591439,9599920,motion passes 4-0  the next item is 13 board policies
cBBkGbZKw_w,9599920,9608960,all right i'll make a motion for  approval of the first reading uh board  policy 2000 through 22 30.
cBBkGbZKw_w,9609200,9617760,any questions or comments  this is just the first  this is just the first reading and so
cBBkGbZKw_w,9617760,9626399,i don't have any  comments yet i've been through it and  i'm  i'm pretty satisfied with it right now
cBBkGbZKw_w,9626399,9631920,if nobody has any changes to the first  reading then i might recommend that we
cBBkGbZKw_w,9631920,9637439,skip the first reading and approve  the board policies
cBBkGbZKw_w,9637439,9642960,uh the only reason i would suggest maybe  we don't do that is only because trustee  demargo's not here and maybe he has
cBBkGbZKw_w,9642960,9650560,something i mean if we just want to save  it to formally approve it at the next  meeting but that's up to you guys
cBBkGbZKw_w,9651450,9656880,[Music]  i don't have an issue with that i mean  we can certainly do that i didn't
cBBkGbZKw_w,9656880,9662160,receive any questions about oh okay  oh that's right he wrote us right okay
cBBkGbZKw_w,9662160,9669200,yeah actually i don't yeah i think he  would have mentioned it i think he's  okay good i think the only one that  there was a difference is the one right
cBBkGbZKw_w,9669200,9676399,near the other yes yes i think you're  right so do you want to mend your  then i withdraw my comment
cBBkGbZKw_w,9676399,9682319,uh i'm good to prissy  uh rochelle do you want to mend your  motion

cBBkGbZKw_w,9687600,9694080,so are we approving the second reading  no i didn't i didn't approve your first  wave the first okay so i will amend my
cBBkGbZKw_w,9694080,9699359,motion to uh  um  to just make a motion to now wave the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9699359,9709600,first reading uh of 2000 through 22 30.  and approve and approve it as final yes
cBBkGbZKw_w,9710240,9719040,is there a second  second  okay all those in favor aye
cBBkGbZKw_w,9720479,9728000,i'll make a motion to approve the first  reading of board bylaw  9320-b meetings and notices second the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9728000,9733279,motion  any questions or comments um
cBBkGbZKw_w,9733279,9741120,michelle yeah do you want do you want to  go ahead no no okay okay i'm just trying  to draw one up i am not happy with the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9741120,9746319,discussion  of what is the  this one does not there's not enough
cBBkGbZKw_w,9746319,9751840,clarity for me uh there's situations in  there where you're talking about uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,9751840,9757359,subcommittees and then committees and  standing committees and the rules of
cBBkGbZKw_w,9757359,9763439,like the finance committee and the fcc  do not fall i'm com i think there needs
cBBkGbZKw_w,9763439,9770640,to be more clarity in that section i'm  trying to find the exact location of  that one but i'm i would like to see
cBBkGbZKw_w,9770640,9776960,that looked at a little more closely i'm  trying to find the action i think that  the only change to this rachelle was
cBBkGbZKw_w,9776960,9784560,where it says at least 72 hours  prior to a regular meeting it includes  it adds the words preferably 120 hours
cBBkGbZKw_w,9784560,9790479,so that it's consistent with the other  the other  by-laws  with regular well there's what about
cBBkGbZKw_w,9790479,9796240,committees is this this is not the one  of the committees is it it's not okay  all right then yeah no that's this is
cBBkGbZKw_w,9796240,9801840,not  i'm gonna be i thought this was the one  with the committee that's okay  this was just to make it consistent with
cBBkGbZKw_w,9801840,9806880,the these are the meetings that's fine  any other comments
cBBkGbZKw_w,9806880,9812640,yeah i i wanted to uh just point out  that um  under the section on the first page
cBBkGbZKw_w,9812640,9818960,regular meetings  we in fact don't always necessarily have  the meetings on the second and fourth
cBBkGbZKw_w,9818960,9824720,tuesdays of the month i note that  in april i think we had our meeting on  april 5th which was the first tuesday of
cBBkGbZKw_w,9824720,9830640,the month like so we should just  clarify if we're saying that we strive  to regularly schedule them on the second
cBBkGbZKw_w,9830640,9836800,and fourth tuesday september we have the  meetings are not on the second and the  fourth right so
cBBkGbZKw_w,9836800,9841920,it just happens with spring break and  other holidays and stuff that come up  they're not always necessarily on the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9841920,9847120,second and fourth so i would suggest  that we have language that just states  that
cBBkGbZKw_w,9847120,9853920,you know something to that effect we  don't need to wordsmith here  um how about unless designated
cBBkGbZKw_w,9853920,9860960,unless otherwise designated  that should work  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,9861279,9867120,i also i'm i'm still i think i brought  this up last time i i still don't love  the language that we added
cBBkGbZKw_w,9867120,9873600,uh meetings will strive to end by 9 pm  i'm fine with that however with a  majority vote the meeting will be
cBBkGbZKw_w,9873600,9881040,extended  it  we're not we're not being consistent  if if the meeting will necessarily end
cBBkGbZKw_w,9881040,9886479,by 9 pm and the only way to extend it  would be with a vote that would be one  thing but we're saying
cBBkGbZKw_w,9886479,9892319,we're just striving to end by 9 pm it's  not clear whether you necessarily have  to take a vote to extend the meeting or
cBBkGbZKw_w,9892319,9898840,not so i just want to be clear about  that so we don't you know we don't we  don't run into a situation in the
cBBkGbZKw_w,9898840,9905520,future so  so i think what i'm suggesting is  meetings will strive to end by 9 pm
cBBkGbZKw_w,9905520,9911359,um i don't think you need the sentence  after that i think it's if you're saying  you strive to end by 9 pm and then it's
cBBkGbZKw_w,9911359,9917439,really up to the president for the  president to decide where we go from  there i  i don't think you necessarily have to
cBBkGbZKw_w,9917439,9922800,take a vote  for the meeting to continue the meet the  the board president can take a straw
cBBkGbZKw_w,9922800,9928399,poll and just see whether people want to  continue or  you know amend the agenda so i would
cBBkGbZKw_w,9928399,9935840,just  my preference or my suggestion would be  to just uh cut out the last sentence of  that paragraph
cBBkGbZKw_w,9938319,9943990,do we need to bring this back  if we change that
cBBkGbZKw_w,9943990,9947080,[Music]
cBBkGbZKw_w,9952880,9958800,i don't think necessary i think we can  that's one  you know those are two small changes
cBBkGbZKw_w,9958800,9964319,that don't significantly change  an an action item so i i think that we
cBBkGbZKw_w,9964319,9970640,could  um  dismiss the first reading yeah
cBBkGbZKw_w,9970640,9976720,i i will have an objection to that can i  make one more comment  sure the paragraph after that at least
cBBkGbZKw_w,9976720,9985840,72 hours preferably 120 i i think you  should add the word  a but preferably 20 120 hours
cBBkGbZKw_w,9986160,9992240,is that i i mean someone probably knows  better than me that  the  the proper
cBBkGbZKw_w,9992240,9998479,ideally  yeah but ideally 120 hours  something to that
cBBkGbZKw_w,9998479,10005279,okay  or as early as  well i don't think it's as early as i  think we would welcome but getting it
cBBkGbZKw_w,10005279,10012640,200 hours before i don't know  dr breggy  and not funny
cBBkGbZKw_w,10015040,10021200,so can we make this change  and approve it or do you have to bring  it back no i mean these are very small
cBBkGbZKw_w,10021200,10027120,changes we can okay we can um just make  a motion to prove
cBBkGbZKw_w,10032240,10038479,yeah great i'm comfortable with that so  should i ideally  should i amend my motion
cBBkGbZKw_w,10038479,10044160,uh i i don't sorry we're going too quick  i don't i don't that have anything  further those are my comments so i think
cBBkGbZKw_w,10044160,10050080,you need to amend your motion  so i'll amend my motion uh to wave the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10050080,10057040,first reading of bylawn 9320 9320-b  meetings and notices and uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,10057040,10062800,approve what we have in front of us with  the suggestions that i've made uh as  final
cBBkGbZKw_w,10062800,10069279,yeah  i'm not supposed perfect but just this
cBBkGbZKw_w,10069279,10075439,made me think  of something that had to do with the  changes to the public comments from the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10075439,10081680,community  if  public comments that are not related
cBBkGbZKw_w,10081680,10088640,agenda  points are going to be at the end of the  meeting right and yet you're saying
cBBkGbZKw_w,10088640,10093760,we're probably going to cut off at nine  then there may be some parents who are  or
cBBkGbZKw_w,10093760,10101439,community members who are coming to  speak about something who are waiting  for their turn at the end of the meeting
cBBkGbZKw_w,10101439,10108279,and then  not get a chance to speak  so maybe
cBBkGbZKw_w,10110800,10116880,right i think that's when we'd have to  take that vote  about
cBBkGbZKw_w,10116880,10122399,what i'm sorry  if the meeting was extending long we'd  have to decide we have a sense of how
cBBkGbZKw_w,10122399,10128880,many comments we have at the beginning  of the meeting so we could decide at the  beginning of the meeting or when
cBBkGbZKw_w,10128880,10134479,at that point in time we at another in  another one of the bylaws it says at 8
cBBkGbZKw_w,10134479,10139680,30 we take it  we  determine where we are in the meeting
cBBkGbZKw_w,10139680,10145680,and then we decide if we're going to  take a vote to extend beyond but at the  beginning of the meeting we typically
cBBkGbZKw_w,10145680,10152399,have a an idea of how many public  comment we have what how much public  comment we have because we get
cBBkGbZKw_w,10152399,10158160,we get those public comments in advance  so we'll have we'll have that sent at  the beginning of the meeting where we
cBBkGbZKw_w,10158160,10164720,can determine if we're going to extend i  would also just add as we did tonight we  move things around on the agenda
cBBkGbZKw_w,10164720,10172319,but depending on who's here and  presenting and how it makes sense but i  think it's a good point yeah it's a good  point thank you
cBBkGbZKw_w,10172319,10178880,uh was there a second for my emotion  there was a second okay michelle i think  you were the second so i think you have  to withdraw first you have to withdraw
cBBkGbZKw_w,10178880,10184960,and then you have to amend  withdrawal motion  and then you can
cBBkGbZKw_w,10184960,10191040,amend  you made an emotion she seconded now  you're going to mend
cBBkGbZKw_w,10191040,10198560,then she can second i think  so i already made the motion so  she just needs a second
cBBkGbZKw_w,10204720,10208600,and  approved
cBBkGbZKw_w,10218080,10224160,with the changes correct okay  all those in favor aye
cBBkGbZKw_w,10224160,10228080,aye motion passes four zero
cBBkGbZKw_w,10230560,10235800,the next item i will make a motion to  approve the first reading of board bylaw
cBBkGbZKw_w,10235800,10240240,9124b  uh attorney
cBBkGbZKw_w,10249680,10255359,the okay is is that we have it's set for  subcommittees and things like that
cBBkGbZKw_w,10255359,10260439,this one's attorney  michelle oh i'm sorry  9924b
cBBkGbZKw_w,10260439,10267160,9124b  yes that's  20  committees 91.
cBBkGbZKw_w,10267160,10273399,9130 is committed yeah 9130 we're on  9124
cBBkGbZKw_w,10273600,10281840,board committees  attorney  we're specifically on 1091-24b
cBBkGbZKw_w,10281840,10286159,that's not the one that came up with me  just a minute
cBBkGbZKw_w,10288000,10294000,approval of first reading bylaw 9130b  board committees
cBBkGbZKw_w,10294000,10300399,no  i haven't wait  oh i'm sorry you we're doing the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10300399,10306240,attorney one first okay i'm sorry  i'm sorry that's okay um
cBBkGbZKw_w,10306240,10311920,did you but i didn't let me make a  motion did somebody make a motion  today
cBBkGbZKw_w,10311920,10318640,you seconded it okay i thought that was  the one on the committees i'm sorry i  missed it do you still want to second  this one yes i will second it do you
cBBkGbZKw_w,10318640,10325760,have any questions on it no i do not  okay  gabe did you um  well i'll note um
cBBkGbZKw_w,10325760,10332319,trustee margot sent us an email before  the meeting um just saying and i'll  quote the board members should not be
cBBkGbZKw_w,10332319,10338640,given carte blanche to speak with  council if council was on a monthly  retainer there wouldn't  be an issue with this since they built
cBBkGbZKw_w,10338640,10344399,hourly this precedent could run up legal  expenses without board knowledge i still  maintain that the superintendent should
cBBkGbZKw_w,10344399,10352080,always be notified when board members  wish to address counsel  directly so that was um
cBBkGbZKw_w,10352080,10357761,that was our colleague's comment sorry  i'm just pulling this back up
cBBkGbZKw_w,10360319,10367680,sorry i have to pull up the attachment  again one second okay  um  so the only part in question is whether
cBBkGbZKw_w,10367680,10372960,the board president may confer with  district legal counsel on behalf of the  board and when possible will inform the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10372960,10378240,superintendent  and board at that time um
cBBkGbZKw_w,10381279,10387200,i think we agreed that that that the  board president should when possible and  inform the superintendent and the board
cBBkGbZKw_w,10387200,10393279,at that time i i yeah i'm just i was  just rereading trusty margot's comment  and looking at the language i think what
cBBkGbZKw_w,10393279,10399680,the internet i'm comfortable with the  intent was not that they would approach  council without knowledge of the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10399680,10405680,superintendent yeah i agree i was just i  was just rereading the language right i  think to make sure that i'm comfortable
cBBkGbZKw_w,10405680,10411279,with it and i am right i think that's  comfortable  yeah yeah i think this language agrees
cBBkGbZKw_w,10411279,10418160,with that yeah  yeah yeah i think it's consistent with  what what trustee margot so what are we
cBBkGbZKw_w,10418160,10423359,putting in there lynn let's clarify  something so the president may confer  with the district council with district
cBBkGbZKw_w,10423359,10430160,legal counsel on behalf of the board and  when possible we'll inform the  superintendent and the board at that  time because there may be a situation
cBBkGbZKw_w,10430160,10435359,where they  they can't reach them and they need to  well i think the question is
cBBkGbZKw_w,10435359,10440560,when possible  should they give  notice to the superintendent and the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10440560,10446000,board ahead of time  right right  that's the question that's the that's
cBBkGbZKw_w,10446000,10451680,the distinction yeah  um  i mean look in theory if it ever became  an issue
cBBkGbZKw_w,10451680,10457840,and the rest of the trustees were really  uncomfortable  then they could you know move to put
cBBkGbZKw_w,10457840,10463200,something  together or could amend this bylaw and  say we're not comfortable with this but
cBBkGbZKw_w,10463200,10468880,i i would  i like to  give the board president whomever that
cBBkGbZKw_w,10468880,10475120,person is at that time a little bit of  flexibility and  i i trust my fellow board members to do
cBBkGbZKw_w,10475120,10482399,the right thing  so  with that i'm  i'm personally comfortable with the  language uh i was drafted
cBBkGbZKw_w,10482399,10488720,as drafted as dropped i agree  okay
cBBkGbZKw_w,10488720,10494880,look if if it does become an issue in  the future  these things can be amended so i'm
cBBkGbZKw_w,10494880,10499160,you know i think it's fine
cBBkGbZKw_w,10502160,10505521,okay i'll call for the vote
cBBkGbZKw_w,10507200,10513200,did you  oh i'm sorry i have to amend the motion  okay
cBBkGbZKw_w,10513200,10518560,i'd like to amend my motion to waive the  first reading of bylaw 91
cBBkGbZKw_w,10518560,10528080,to for the appro  excuse me i'd like to amend my motion  for the first reading of bylaw 9124b
cBBkGbZKw_w,10528080,10533520,attorney  and approve bylon 9124b attorney as
cBBkGbZKw_w,10533520,10540479,presented as final  i think michelle has to second that yeah
cBBkGbZKw_w,10540479,10547439,yeah i think you have to second it a  second okay  okay  all those in favor aye aye motion passes
cBBkGbZKw_w,10547439,10554520,4-0  i'd like to make a motion to approve the  first reading of board bylaw
cBBkGbZKw_w,10554520,10559000,9130b board committees
cBBkGbZKw_w,10570479,10578240,the fact that  the finance committee and the um
cBBkGbZKw_w,10578240,10584399,fcc  uh in this and that they operate under a  little bit different uh type of bylaw
cBBkGbZKw_w,10584399,10590800,and i don't think that this is taken  into effect in this particular uh by law  i know that there are the rules and
cBBkGbZKw_w,10590800,10597279,regulations for the other committees  listed with the other committees but i  think that  there should be something in this
cBBkGbZKw_w,10597279,10603279,particular one that addresses that also  because i think it's missing  uh i just want to make sure i understand
cBBkGbZKw_w,10603279,10610319,so are you saying oh sorry no you go  ahead are so are you saying you would  like this bylaw to specifically list all
cBBkGbZKw_w,10610319,10616000,of the standing board committees that we  have or that it points out that these
cBBkGbZKw_w,10616000,10621120,there are particular committees that  don't  fit because they're called committees  there's
cBBkGbZKw_w,10621120,10627920,finance committee uh  facilities and construction committee  which do not fall in this category at
cBBkGbZKw_w,10627920,10634880,all and they have their own set of  bylaws so to speak  so i mean i'm just saying that
cBBkGbZKw_w,10634880,10640560,there's what part are you  can you  point out what part you're talking about  that that that those committees you just
cBBkGbZKw_w,10640560,10646560,named wouldn't apply well  the like what  for example
cBBkGbZKw_w,10646560,10654720,like the cbo that the cbo so cboc is a  different committee also but we had the  return to learn we had the for focus uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,10654720,10660000,when and those types of committees which  would fall in this jurisdiction
cBBkGbZKw_w,10660000,10665040,and mrs marcus it wouldn't fall in this  jurisdiction because these are governing
cBBkGbZKw_w,10665040,10672800,board established committees um and like  a future focused schools team would be a  superintendent's committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,10672800,10678399,or or or there are ad hoc committees  that could be formed for different  purposes
cBBkGbZKw_w,10678399,10684800,okay but where are you putting the  finance committee i i think if you look  at the first paragraph where it's at the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10684800,10690960,end of the first paragraph where it says  such committees may be sub-committees of  the board or committees that include
cBBkGbZKw_w,10690960,10696960,board members of the committee staff or  other stakeholder groups  so the finances i'm looking at the new
cBBkGbZKw_w,10696960,10702880,one are you looking at the new one yes  so the finance committee and the  facilities and construction committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,10702880,10708720,would be considered a board subcommittee  we're no i don't the first paragraph
cBBkGbZKw_w,10708720,10714960,under what  the very first paragraph the last  sentence
cBBkGbZKw_w,10715120,10720000,to the second to last second to last the  second one i'm sorry
cBBkGbZKw_w,10721359,10727359,such committees may be sub-committees of  the board our committees that include  members of the committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,10727359,10731840,community staff or other stakeholder  groups
cBBkGbZKw_w,10732479,10739680,that kind of covers all board  governing board committees the second  under edits below i see upon
cBBkGbZKw_w,10739680,10745200,establishing a committee the board shall  clearly define the committee's purpose
cBBkGbZKw_w,10747520,10754560,the governing board may establish a  committee whenever it determines that  such a committee would benefit the  district by providing diverse viewpoints
cBBkGbZKw_w,10754560,10759680,special  and so such committees may be  sub-committees of the board or  committees that include committees of
cBBkGbZKw_w,10759680,10766560,the members staff i see nothing in that  paragraph that says  finance or facilities in construction
cBBkGbZKw_w,10766560,10773120,okay so it doesn't need to specifically  name the committees here we don't we  don't need to name what the committees
cBBkGbZKw_w,10773120,10778319,are we're just giving ourselves the  flexibility to say that we have the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10778319,10785200,right we have the ability to form  committees and subcommittees you know as  we deem necessary the finance committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,10785200,10791439,would be one of those  are you more comfortable with such
cBBkGbZKw_w,10791439,10797680,committees  that they have their own sets of bylaws  and the ways that they're hired and so
cBBkGbZKw_w,10797680,10803279,on and this one says that this could be  appointed by the the  superintendent or the president but
cBBkGbZKw_w,10803279,10809120,that's not the way those committees are  selected we're not saying that that's  the only way to do it i understand but i
cBBkGbZKw_w,10809120,10814240,i what i'm saying is that i'm not  happy with the way it is you want it to
cBBkGbZKw_w,10814240,10822000,be more clear  it's not clearly stated to me that's all  i'm saying so so so would you prefer it
cBBkGbZKw_w,10822000,10829439,in addition there be language to say  that such committees may have their own  for example certain committees such as
cBBkGbZKw_w,10829439,10836880,finance which are standing committees be  and are subject to a different set of  bylaws would not fall in was such as
cBBkGbZKw_w,10836880,10843439,because in this one it says that the  president can appoint a committee and it  says here that uh for example um
cBBkGbZKw_w,10843439,10849200,and appointed by the board president  subject to board approval well you know  that the members of the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10849200,10855439,finance committee and the uh which book  hall committee are not appointed in that  way right they are appointed by the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10855439,10861359,person who's you know  but the beginning of that sentence says  except for subcommittees of the board
cBBkGbZKw_w,10861359,10867040,but okay but what are the subcommittees  of the board finance committee  facilities that doesn't say that
cBBkGbZKw_w,10867040,10872560,what could change  well that's what i'm saying that this is  not clear to me and i don't think
cBBkGbZKw_w,10872560,10878399,there's clarity in this particular  portion of the by-law  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,10878399,10884880,i think there needs to be maybe  maybe what we should do the definition
cBBkGbZKw_w,10884880,10889920,of the subcommittee  what a subcommittee of the board is
cBBkGbZKw_w,10889920,10896640,or  or we can  um we can  name as of today what some of the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10896640,10903040,standing committees are and how those  committees conduct themselves  so we can like acknowledge i think what
cBBkGbZKw_w,10903040,10909680,uh what i'm saying is that  they're not acknowledged in here as far  as i know what they are i mean that's
cBBkGbZKw_w,10909680,10915920,not my question  i obviously know what they are but this  is not clear for someone who would pick
cBBkGbZKw_w,10915920,10922960,this up  and read it  as far as knowing that there's two  committees out there that
cBBkGbZKw_w,10922960,10929680,and even i'm not sure about the cboc uh  eating committee because those are  really like standing committees
cBBkGbZKw_w,10929680,10934960,so i i just i'm  i'm going to with adding a little more  language to make you comfortable but i
cBBkGbZKw_w,10934960,10941120,just wanted to know like this is just  meant to be the general policy like the  board has the right to be able to do
cBBkGbZKw_w,10941120,10948720,these things but we're we're not  typically going into the level of  specificity in the bylaw itself to say
cBBkGbZKw_w,10948720,10954160,this is specifically how we're  conducting ourselves we can do that  i mean if it makes you feel more
cBBkGbZKw_w,10954160,10960560,comfortable i would be preferred to be  to be more comfortable i would like that  to be in there yes i i would make the
cBBkGbZKw_w,10960560,10967920,recommendation that we pull this one and  then  work on it bring it back to the 7 12. so  then you have some time to work on it to
cBBkGbZKw_w,10967920,10973520,to  really express what you're talking about  no problem i'll i'll
cBBkGbZKw_w,10973520,10979680,so while we're doing that then let me  just throw out one more comment uh where  it says no appointee shall serve
cBBkGbZKw_w,10979680,10985359,on more than any one committee i think  we should clarify  that um
cBBkGbZKw_w,10985359,10992080,an appointee  may not serve on more than one committee  well  and are we are we talking about
cBBkGbZKw_w,10992080,10998000,subcommittees there too right so  a  a board member could sit on a committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,10998000,11004240,and a subcommittee no not board members  appointees  i'm sorry appointees could an appointee
cBBkGbZKw_w,11004240,11012801,sit on both a committee and a  subcommittee  appointees on more than one committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,11012960,11020240,no we're saying no appointment so that  sentence we added no appointee shall  serve  on more than any one committee are we
cBBkGbZKw_w,11020240,11026080,saying that no appointee shall serve on  any more than one committee and  subcommittee
cBBkGbZKw_w,11026080,11031760,like are are we lumping in subcommittees  there i just thought that would be worth  worth worth clarifying yes that's all
cBBkGbZKw_w,11031760,11038080,i'm saying so while we're going to open  this up let's just address that  right i think you're taking it too far
cBBkGbZKw_w,11038080,11044479,there i would just say more than any  just so let's just let's just clean it  up more than one committee yeah okay so
cBBkGbZKw_w,11044479,11050319,i will i will withdraw my uh motion for  the well we're just approving the first
cBBkGbZKw_w,11050319,11055920,reading right or  is it better for me to alter it  to  come back and bring a different
cBBkGbZKw_w,11055920,11061840,perspective so so just to kind of an  interesting note um  because i'm doing a lot of uh the
cBBkGbZKw_w,11061840,11067040,behind-the-scenes work on uh these  policies um and and the the statement
cBBkGbZKw_w,11067040,11072880,actually comes from our  current policy so um our current policy
cBBkGbZKw_w,11072880,11079600,says no board appointee shall serve on  more than one board appointee committee  so it's not a stretch
cBBkGbZKw_w,11079600,11085040,it's not a it's you know it it's already  been in our and i understand we're  discussing it but i just wanted you to
cBBkGbZKw_w,11085040,11091160,realize that it's been in our our old  board um
cBBkGbZKw_w,11099920,11105439,so  what's in the old policy is no board  appointee
cBBkGbZKw_w,11105439,11111880,uh shall serve on more than any one  board  uh appointed
cBBkGbZKw_w,11111880,11118080,committee there's two new words  you're going to take this back to your
cBBkGbZKw_w,11118080,11124000,guys so i take it back so should should  we table or should i withdraw i think we  should i think you should table this she

cBBkGbZKw_w,11184080,11190399,the next item is 14b discussion finance  committee request
cBBkGbZKw_w,11190399,11197359,this was oppressed by the finance  committee eliot finkel came to the board  and  requested to receive backup for the
cBBkGbZKw_w,11197359,11204880,construction audit of b1 and b2  and i put it on to this um
cBBkGbZKw_w,11204880,11210000,agenda so that the board can discuss  this we didn't discuss it at that  meeting and i wanted to follow up on
cBBkGbZKw_w,11210000,11217760,that b1 and b2 or b3 and b4  we had they requested the backup  information for b1 and b2
cBBkGbZKw_w,11217760,11224641,clarification was that for the  audit that was given to us on december  3rd
cBBkGbZKw_w,11225279,11231840,i remember the date  i believe that audit was done december  3rd  we had a discussion on it in a study
cBBkGbZKw_w,11231840,11238080,session  it's the only construction audit that's  been done
cBBkGbZKw_w,11238080,11245279,it was for b1 and b2  so  from a 30 000 foot view i would like to
cBBkGbZKw_w,11245279,11252319,say that i we i i'll speak for myself i  um strive to be as transparent as we
cBBkGbZKw_w,11252319,11258800,possibly can be with the community and  uh specifically on the construction  program given everything that we've been
cBBkGbZKw_w,11258800,11263840,dealing with  um  subject to  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,11263840,11269880,consulting with  our  council to make sure that we're not you  know breaching any kind of
cBBkGbZKw_w,11269880,11276319,confidentiality  or  you know any  you know barring any legal issues uh i
cBBkGbZKw_w,11276319,11282720,would be in  uh favor of uh cooperating with the  finance committee and releasing the
cBBkGbZKw_w,11282720,11288960,information that they are requesting  michelle did you have any comments
cBBkGbZKw_w,11288960,11296240,no i agree with uh mr hilimi on that  comment i think i pretty much as long as  it's within the parameters of what we
cBBkGbZKw_w,11296240,11304240,can do legally i agree with what he said  i'll i'll i'll add that i think as a
cBBkGbZKw_w,11304240,11310319,as a general  thinking about this subject  as a public
cBBkGbZKw_w,11310319,11317439,uh entity who's responsible to our  community  for those that are doing business
cBBkGbZKw_w,11317439,11323520,with us  there really should not be  a reasonable um
cBBkGbZKw_w,11323520,11330800,expectation i don't think there should  be an expectation that anything would be  confidential  we'll work it out but
cBBkGbZKw_w,11330800,11336000,we'll make sure we cross t's and dot  eyes but i  i am in favor of
cBBkGbZKw_w,11336000,11341520,sharing the information i'll say that  i agree as well i think that the more
cBBkGbZKw_w,11341520,11348800,information we have to  in front of us to understand some of the  major questions we have about shortfalls
cBBkGbZKw_w,11348800,11354399,and what have you i think the better so  i'm all in favor of furnishing all sorts  of information
cBBkGbZKw_w,11354399,11360720,in whatever depth is  feasible and lawful
cBBkGbZKw_w,11363279,11370399,um i agree i think that  it's important for us to be transparent  and i am in favor of sharing any
cBBkGbZKw_w,11370399,11375760,information that  is available  to the finance committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,11375760,11382479,if there's a question about  whether or not  information should be shared and it has
cBBkGbZKw_w,11382479,11388000,it's related to construction i would  perhaps recommend that uh it get run by
cBBkGbZKw_w,11388000,11393359,that we run that through um  our construction law firm
cBBkGbZKw_w,11393359,11398720,and ask them if there's any questions  about anything that um  that needs to be run by them but other
cBBkGbZKw_w,11398720,11405279,than that i would  i absolutely um  stand for transparency transparency so
cBBkGbZKw_w,11405279,11411880,i i would recommend that we give the  direction to provide that information
cBBkGbZKw_w,11412479,11418319,i would agree with that  so um
cBBkGbZKw_w,11418319,11424399,all right then i guess uh  in summary then i would say that we  would like to
cBBkGbZKw_w,11424399,11429520,give direction to  give the finance committee the backup
cBBkGbZKw_w,11429520,11437200,information they've requested and if  there's any question to  run any questions through pkec
cBBkGbZKw_w,11437200,11443439,all right thank you so much  the next question i mean next item on
cBBkGbZKw_w,11443439,11449120,the agenda is 14c  discussion of recording committee
cBBkGbZKw_w,11449120,11454800,meetings  can i ask why this was brought up  because as far as i know
cBBkGbZKw_w,11454800,11460479,all re all committee meetings have are  recorded and then they are uploaded by
cBBkGbZKw_w,11460479,11466560,dr briggy if whoever's sharing the  meeting i know that they're recorded and  then they're uploaded so i don't know
cBBkGbZKw_w,11466560,11472000,why this was brought up for discussion  unless there was an issue of one  recently
cBBkGbZKw_w,11472000,11479120,i think there was one or more recently  because uh this is also something that  i've forgotten emails about from members
cBBkGbZKw_w,11479120,11485439,of the right  just for clarification though i do i do  not upload uh  these um you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,11485439,11490960,this material or the minutes or  recordings  i mean and i think we can speak to it
cBBkGbZKw_w,11490960,11496560,but my understanding is you know prior  to kovid we didn't record like the cboc
cBBkGbZKw_w,11496560,11504080,meeting and all of these other meetings  and as as groups are coming back to  having in-person meetings i think
cBBkGbZKw_w,11504080,11510720,my understanding is that the cboc had an  in-person meeting so they didn't record  because they went back to being all in
cBBkGbZKw_w,11510720,11516560,person so  there's been a request  can we have these meetings
cBBkGbZKw_w,11516560,11522960,continue to be recorded i think at the  moment as i recall and i was at that  meeting they were not prepared
cBBkGbZKw_w,11522960,11528080,to record it i think that was an issue  i'm not sure but i think that was
cBBkGbZKw_w,11528080,11535120,that's why we have wade  president wells members of the board as  i'm the liaison for the district for
cBBkGbZKw_w,11535120,11540560,many of these committees  you're absolutely right  prior to covet
cBBkGbZKw_w,11540560,11546000,these committees were in person  the community would come to the meetings
cBBkGbZKw_w,11546000,11552080,we would actually have an audio  recording of the meeting  and that was both for us for staff to
cBBkGbZKw_w,11552080,11557279,take minutes  and it could be viewed or listened to by  the press or whomever
cBBkGbZKw_w,11557279,11563120,after the fact during covet of course we  all went to zoom  which made it great and it was so simple
cBBkGbZKw_w,11563120,11570560,we would just record the meeting in zoom  and then we'd upload it to the district  website it wasn't live per se because we
cBBkGbZKw_w,11570560,11576720,don't have that technology to broadcast  live unless we're in this great facility  but when we'd have those meetings at the
cBBkGbZKw_w,11576720,11583279,district office we would record them on  zoom and then of course upload them to  the district website now that we're
cBBkGbZKw_w,11583279,11588880,coming back we have this dichotomy of  some of my committees or your committees
cBBkGbZKw_w,11588880,11594399,want to be  completely on zoom  which makes it easy because we'll just
cBBkGbZKw_w,11594399,11599439,continue to  record them on zoom and then upload them  they're not live per se but they're
cBBkGbZKw_w,11599439,11605200,uploaded in the in a day or so  um but some of uh your committees uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,11605200,11611120,want to be in person  um and  we're working on the technology to be  able to
cBBkGbZKw_w,11611120,11616960,record  uh tape them if you will  and then  upload them
cBBkGbZKw_w,11616960,11622239,but that's not a perfect technology for  us yet  so that's where we are right now present
cBBkGbZKw_w,11622239,11628000,oils and members of the board and also  just to add that um  you know this is also a provision that
cBBkGbZKw_w,11628000,11633200,is probably going to go away very soon  um you know we voted on it this evening
cBBkGbZKw_w,11633200,11638399,um to have virtual meetings and we do  that just to cover ourselves uh for
cBBkGbZKw_w,11638399,11644319,those sub-committees that are meeting  that want to be virtual but you know  this isn't you know governor newsom is
cBBkGbZKw_w,11644319,11650800,not going to keep this going uh this was  you know it was for kovid 19. so um
cBBkGbZKw_w,11650800,11657840,we're not sure how much longer that will  go  but we did approve it for  tonight for next month i will say that i
cBBkGbZKw_w,11657840,11664960,think the question of having virtual  meetings versus recording meetings or  two different questions right i i think
cBBkGbZKw_w,11664960,11671680,you know we're we're we're paying a  pretty penny for zoom uh either way we  we just approved that contract i think
cBBkGbZKw_w,11671680,11678720,at the last board meeting  um  and we also just tabled um the
cBBkGbZKw_w,11678720,11684479,bylaw for committees and we could easily  add  in there something to the effect that we
cBBkGbZKw_w,11684479,11690000,expect that all committee meetings would  be recorded if we did decide to do that  here but so
cBBkGbZKw_w,11690000,11695520,my preference would be just on the  discussion of this topic  would be that we make those zoom
cBBkGbZKw_w,11695520,11702160,licenses available to our committee  members and whether or not they're  meeting in person or virtual
cBBkGbZKw_w,11702160,11708000,someone just open up zoom record and at  some point we upload uh the committee uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,11708000,11713439,meeting just in the interest of  transparency with the community i don't  i don't know why we wouldn't do that so
cBBkGbZKw_w,11713439,11719439,that would be my preference to have the  meetings recorded and we have a  mechanism to do that through zoom
cBBkGbZKw_w,11719439,11724960,whether they're virtual or in person  someone could open up zoom and record it  so um
cBBkGbZKw_w,11724960,11730319,i i think it's a good idea  i i miss  dr brady what i meant was when i said
cBBkGbZKw_w,11730319,11736080,that  that you send it to somebody who puts it  on something that's what i was referring
cBBkGbZKw_w,11736080,11741520,to i think that's before i misunderstood  yeah but well because i can't attend all
cBBkGbZKw_w,11741520,11747279,of the no no no i didn't mean that you  were at the meeting no no like it's okay  it's no i just didn't mean that you
cBBkGbZKw_w,11747279,11753200,taped them all i just was  no i mean that eventually i because i  got a call from somebody once where it
cBBkGbZKw_w,11753200,11758239,was the meeting they wanted to see it  and it had not yet been uploaded to the
cBBkGbZKw_w,11758239,11763840,to the  set to be a cab and  that you send it to somebody and they do
cBBkGbZKw_w,11763840,11769359,it that's all i was referring when i  said it before yeah and i just that's  just for our board meetings but uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,11769359,11775600,there's other people that are involved  that do the recording of those meetings  um but no yeah i know but you know and
cBBkGbZKw_w,11775600,11782080,it brings up a good point i mean i i  think there needs to be some consistency  you know um and perhaps it is in the
cBBkGbZKw_w,11782080,11789520,policy section but um you know we need  some consistency i mean we do put things  up um on the website and they're there
cBBkGbZKw_w,11789520,11794560,um but  uh you know we we could use some  consistency as as far as like how much
cBBkGbZKw_w,11794560,11799760,time after a meeting could somebody  expect for something to be reported and
cBBkGbZKw_w,11799760,11805120,uploaded i mean i think that the bigger  question is  after covid what to the point that
cBBkGbZKw_w,11805120,11810560,gabe's making do we want to continue to  record  our meetings that are
cBBkGbZKw_w,11810560,11816479,our board committee meetings our  subcommittee meetings  in in
cBBkGbZKw_w,11816479,11823359,you know from a transparency standpoint  for people that can't attend the meeting  uh so that they are able to go back and
cBBkGbZKw_w,11823359,11829120,watch that meeting  at at a later point in time and it makes  it available to everybody so if people
cBBkGbZKw_w,11829120,11834160,can't go to a cboc meeting and they want  to they can watch it
cBBkGbZKw_w,11834160,11839600,you know they can watch the recording  even if it's up two days later that it's  available to them
cBBkGbZKw_w,11839600,11844880,and i i think that that's a great thing  that has been the
cBBkGbZKw_w,11844880,11850000,byproduct of of covid is that that made  made those meetings available to the
cBBkGbZKw_w,11850000,11855120,public and um  and said board members because  if
cBBkGbZKw_w,11855120,11860239,you're if you want to be at a finance  committee meeting and you don't have  time to be at the finance committee at
cBBkGbZKw_w,11860239,11865439,that time at that at that moment  and you're not the you know the board
cBBkGbZKw_w,11865439,11871200,representative for it you still have the  ability to go and watch that meeting and  it's informative so
cBBkGbZKw_w,11871200,11877359,i think it's informative for everybody  if they're able to make the time so  i would recommend if it's possible to
cBBkGbZKw_w,11877359,11883359,continue to record those meetings  they're not the best recordings  but um
cBBkGbZKw_w,11883359,11890399,but it does give you information and if  you you know you can  it's not that different than if you're  recording just the audio because
cBBkGbZKw_w,11890399,11896160,typically what i've noticed is you might  hear one or two people and regardless of
cBBkGbZKw_w,11896160,11901520,where the the camera is focused you you  may only hear certain voices but you do
cBBkGbZKw_w,11901520,11906560,hear the context of the meeting and if  and what people are
cBBkGbZKw_w,11906560,11913200,discussing or what's being presented so  i think it's helpful  and i would recommend if possible to
cBBkGbZKw_w,11913200,11919359,continue to  to  keep those meetings on the website as  recordings i mean is there a cost in
cBBkGbZKw_w,11919359,11927640,terms of storing that type of media i  mean is that is it really heavy in terms  of memory
cBBkGbZKw_w,11931520,11937760,um dr stan uh so to repeat that question  uh the storage for the media is done
cBBkGbZKw_w,11937760,11944160,throughout uh websites on edlio there  will not be an additional cost for that  okay so it's not a cost or a burden
cBBkGbZKw_w,11944160,11950640,particularly the recording through zoom  could always be transferred internally  to google meet which we already pay for
cBBkGbZKw_w,11950640,11956319,through our enterprise um  service agreement with google so
cBBkGbZKw_w,11956319,11962720,there isn't an additional cost that i  can see in terms of the logistics of how  that happens uh that falls back into mr
cBBkGbZKw_w,11962720,11968800,roach's department but in terms of the  storage um excellent question no  additional cost and no limit on terms of
cBBkGbZKw_w,11968800,11974319,like bandwidth that is able to you know  storage space or anything we have plenty  i'm sure we have plenty
cBBkGbZKw_w,11974319,11980239,thank you  so can i can i make a a recommendation  uh or just try to get some consensus
cBBkGbZKw_w,11980239,11988080,from my fellow board members to  maybe give direction uh to  the uh administration that maybe we just
cBBkGbZKw_w,11988080,11993120,uh while we still have that  uh committee bylaw open
cBBkGbZKw_w,11993120,12000000,uh that we add something to the effect  that the expectation is  uh zoom or google meet or some other
cBBkGbZKw_w,12000000,12006160,mechanism will be used to record uh the  meeting and that we will strive to get
cBBkGbZKw_w,12006160,12011600,that recording up on a district website  within 24 to 48 hours from the time of
cBBkGbZKw_w,12011600,12019200,the meeting  okay 72 hours is what i hear from  administration i'm comfortable with that
cBBkGbZKw_w,12021439,12027279,i believe  i believe if i'm not mistaken on the uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,12027279,12033920,beverly hills  website there's where it says watch you  can watch meetings uh after the fact so
cBBkGbZKw_w,12033920,12040479,that's it's already  there that you should be able to see the  meetings which is what i believe gabe  was referring to
cBBkGbZKw_w,12040479,12047200,if i'm not mistaken  uh the board meetings yes and if you go  under uh like on the website through
cBBkGbZKw_w,12047200,12053920,like business and finance is that's  where you can find um  uh where like for example cboc
cBBkGbZKw_w,12053920,12059520,meetings are there agendas their minutes  their recordings
cBBkGbZKw_w,12064960,12070239,okay any other comments  that brings us to item 16 communication
cBBkGbZKw_w,12070239,12074881,from board members  michelle
cBBkGbZKw_w,12077040,12081880,we don't have any public comment this  evening
cBBkGbZKw_w,12084560,12090000,i would um  like to mention  i saw something uh that the governor is
cBBkGbZKw_w,12090000,12097040,planning on some of those restrictive  funds  the funds for the uh
cBBkGbZKw_w,12097040,12104239,uh the um  coming up and what it said was music and  i took immediate note of that there's
cBBkGbZKw_w,12104239,12109359,going to be music because i have to tell  you about something that i attended  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,12109359,12115520,i attended the warner avenue and this  plays into the whole thing warner avenue
cBBkGbZKw_w,12115520,12121840,what they called promotion in fifth  grade was the warner avenue culmination  they called it culmination
cBBkGbZKw_w,12121840,12127200,and it was particularly uh interesting  that it was a total
cBBkGbZKw_w,12127200,12135120,student participation they sang they  read poems they did all kinds of things  they came out it was really wonderful
cBBkGbZKw_w,12135120,12141359,and i was thinking about that because i  remember attending the hawthorne
cBBkGbZKw_w,12141359,12148000,promotion  and at that promotion the kids some of  the students were taught to play the
cBBkGbZKw_w,12148000,12154479,ukulele  now i thought when i saw that that that  was just delightful the kids were
cBBkGbZKw_w,12154479,12159520,playing the ukulele and the kids and the  the rest of the kids were singing the
cBBkGbZKw_w,12159520,12165439,song  and that just made me feel so good like  that there was
cBBkGbZKw_w,12165439,12171520,kids playing instruments now i know  we used to have instrumental music of
cBBkGbZKw_w,12171520,12177439,some sort in the elementary school  but somehow that has taken a departure
cBBkGbZKw_w,12177439,12185840,and i have to tell you the music is one  of the most wonderful things for kids  to learn to do at a very early age
cBBkGbZKw_w,12185840,12192560,and i am hoping that somehow  somewhere with this money that's coming  back from where i don't know from the
cBBkGbZKw_w,12192560,12200319,governor and it's got music i saw music  and on top of which it would be a  pathway again another pathway to get
cBBkGbZKw_w,12200319,12205520,more kids to learn instruments going  into sixth grade from the elementary
cBBkGbZKw_w,12205520,12212239,school i mean i think that that's one  area where we could improve our  enrollment in the music classes i love
cBBkGbZKw_w,12212239,12219520,that idea  and  i just wanted to talk about that tonight  because that really impressed me and
cBBkGbZKw_w,12219520,12223560,that's my comment tonight
cBBkGbZKw_w,12226080,12232399,i have a few comments uh one i just  wanted to  uh say again how proud i am of this
cBBkGbZKw_w,12232399,12238720,board the administration our community  the cboc like everyone that's just been  working together on
cBBkGbZKw_w,12238720,12245120,uh getting this ball rolling on uh  making the pivots that we're making in  our construction program i i really feel
cBBkGbZKw_w,12245120,12250800,good about it so thank you to the  uh  uh to to dr breggy wade you know
cBBkGbZKw_w,12250800,12256080,everyone that's worked so hard to  really take the reins of this uh program
cBBkGbZKw_w,12256080,12262640,um feels feels really good  um i do also think it was very poetic  that right after the cboc presentation
cBBkGbZKw_w,12262640,12269040,or approving the rfps like it's you know  feels feels good  um
cBBkGbZKw_w,12269040,12275279,i wanted to say hi to alex  sitting back there we're looking forward  to having you up here uh soon
cBBkGbZKw_w,12275279,12281600,um  and i i just wanted to highlight uh the  cte uh program that we were
cBBkGbZKw_w,12281600,12287040,talking about earlier one of the one of  the things that  uh kind of pushed me to
cBBkGbZKw_w,12287040,12292239,um you know throw my hat in the ring to  join this board something that i'm  pretty passionate about
cBBkGbZKw_w,12292239,12297600,is um i think one of the  big issues in our country
cBBkGbZKw_w,12297600,12304080,is our student loan debt  and you know  how expensive university education has
cBBkGbZKw_w,12304080,12309520,become i've done a lot of research on  this subject so  adjusted for inflation fun fact adjusted
cBBkGbZKw_w,12309520,12314640,for inflation  the university of pennsylvania in 1920
cBBkGbZKw_w,12314640,12319920,was 3 800  a year  adjusted for inflation today it's over
cBBkGbZKw_w,12319920,12327920,60 000. so let's just let's just like  look at that right  cost of education skyrocketing after
cBBkGbZKw_w,12327920,12333200,12th grade  and you have at no point in history
cBBkGbZKw_w,12333200,12338800,have you had more people coming out of  college and either not finding a job or
cBBkGbZKw_w,12338800,12344800,not using their degree  towards their first job over 50 percent
cBBkGbZKw_w,12344800,12351200,of kids who graduate from college that's  the case and they're also coming out  with record student loan debt right over
cBBkGbZKw_w,12351200,12358080,thirty thousand dollars the reason why i  bring all this up is because i think  we're at a point in history where
cBBkGbZKw_w,12358080,12365200,we gotta pivot more of our attention in  public education  towards skills that people actually need
cBBkGbZKw_w,12365200,12371279,when they come out of school it's great  that we have the the you know top-notch  academic education but i think we need
cBBkGbZKw_w,12371279,12378319,to complement that top-notch academic  education with real practical skills  that people need for their careers and
cBBkGbZKw_w,12378319,12383520,i'm just so proud of it like i really  was not aware of the programming that we
cBBkGbZKw_w,12383520,12388640,had here  before i joined this board and every  board meeting we we keep highlighting
cBBkGbZKw_w,12388640,12394239,this educate it keeps it keeps coming up  what we're doing and i'm just immensely  proud of it and wanted to highlight it
cBBkGbZKw_w,12394239,12400399,thanks  thank you gabe  speaking of higher education and
cBBkGbZKw_w,12400399,12406640,speaking of what happens to our students  specifically our  our girls once they graduate um from
cBBkGbZKw_w,12406640,12412960,high school here i really feel that i  wanted to say something about uh what  happened um last week with the
cBBkGbZKw_w,12412960,12418960,the ruling um the overturning of roe  versus wade and i will say that i do not  speak for the board i speak for myself
cBBkGbZKw_w,12418960,12424319,but i i did want to say  you know in reflecting about our young  women who will leave our
cBBkGbZKw_w,12424319,12429840,high school  the ruling will have widespread  implications including within the higher
cBBkGbZKw_w,12429840,12436239,education community  restrictions in many of the states will  limit some students access to
cBBkGbZKw_w,12436239,12443840,reproductive health services  thereby negatively affecting education  access and graduation rates for pregnant
cBBkGbZKw_w,12443840,12451279,women  further the health and mental health of  some of these students may very well  suffer as a direct result of this ruling
cBBkGbZKw_w,12451279,12458560,so i personally find it  very unfortunate for our young women and  i hope to move forward with
cBBkGbZKw_w,12458560,12464479,gaining some sort of stronghold and some  sort of  rights to ensure that our
cBBkGbZKw_w,12464479,12470800,young graduates continue to thrive in  their  secondary education thank you
cBBkGbZKw_w,12472319,12477520,thank you dr stern for what you said i  really appreciate that and agree with  you  um
