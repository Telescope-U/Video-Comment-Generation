E0LvBeZM0t4,1373039,1380000,all the pain instead i decided to change  my stars  i decided to say enough was enough and
E0LvBeZM0t4,1380000,1386559,focus  on ways to change them  it's easy to say that i'll try that
E0LvBeZM0t4,1386559,1393120,thing tomorrow or i'll do that tomorrow  one day i'll get in shape one day i'll  tell that person how i feel

E0LvBeZM0t4,1404000,1409600,that thing the problem is  we look at all these opportunities  around us and we say they're risky
E0LvBeZM0t4,1409600,1415760,what you've got to realize is life in  itself is risky  it ain't important how long you live
E0LvBeZM0t4,1415760,1422320,what's important is how you live  when life gets on top of you and you  feel like it's all becoming too much
E0LvBeZM0t4,1422320,1428159,it's easy to let things spiral out of  control  i've been there that place where you  feel like the weight of the world is on
E0LvBeZM0t4,1428159,1434400,your shoulders  things don't go your way that promotion  at work you don't get  you don't make the team that person you

E0LvBeZM0t4,1439679,1445000,we all go through dark times  my advice to you
E0LvBeZM0t4,1445000,1451039,[Music]  is to focus on finding the light
E0LvBeZM0t4,1452400,1458080,i'm here to talk about success
E0LvBeZM0t4,1458080,1463919,the first rule of success is to have a  vision  you see if you don't have a vision of
E0LvBeZM0t4,1463919,1469279,where you go and if you don't have a  goal where you go  you drift around and you never end up
E0LvBeZM0t4,1469279,1474480,anywhere  i mean as you know i was born in 1947 in  austria
E0LvBeZM0t4,1474480,1482480,after the second world war so i was very  fortunate  that i stumbled under my vision
E0LvBeZM0t4,1482480,1489039,and i didn't really like austria when i  grew up  i couldn't wait to get out of there i
E0LvBeZM0t4,1489039,1495120,couldn't see myself becoming a farmer  or a worker in a factory or anything
E0LvBeZM0t4,1495120,1504000,like that  even though my parents wanted me to stay  there and have a normal  life but that was their vision not mine
E0LvBeZM0t4,1504000,1511679,my vision was totally different i felt  that i was born for something special  for something unique  for something big then one day i went to
E0LvBeZM0t4,1511679,1517200,school  i remember was 11 years old  and they showed a documentary about
E0LvBeZM0t4,1517200,1522390,america  and there they showed this documentary  the huge skyscrapers
E0LvBeZM0t4,1522390,1528080,[Music]  the high-rises the huge bridges
E0LvBeZM0t4,1528080,1533200,the six lane freeways  and all of this toughness and myself
E0LvBeZM0t4,1533200,1538480,that's where i want to be  i don't want to be around here with  these little farm houses and these
E0LvBeZM0t4,1538480,1546000,little buildings  i want to be in america one day  after school i walked by a store in graz
E0LvBeZM0t4,1546000,1551760,so i went inside and i looked around and  then i saw a magazine  it's a bodybuilding magazine that had
E0LvBeZM0t4,1551760,1557760,reg park  on the cover ridge park was then a  three-time mr universe
E0LvBeZM0t4,1557760,1564320,and i saw him on the big screen as  hercules  i read that and i said to myself wow
E0LvBeZM0t4,1564320,1570640,this is the blueprint for my life  this is exactly what i want to do i want
E0LvBeZM0t4,1570640,1576080,to become a bodybuilding champion just  like rage park  i want to get into movies just like rage
E0LvBeZM0t4,1576080,1584080,park  and i want to make millions of dollars  and be rich and famous  just like reg park you know how great
E0LvBeZM0t4,1584080,1590000,it felt that i knew where i was going  imagine the majority of people don't
E0LvBeZM0t4,1590000,1596320,know where they're going  i knew where i was going that i'm going  to become this bodybuilding champion
E0LvBeZM0t4,1596320,1604000,just like him so it was just a question  of how do you do it  i was so relieved because when you have
E0LvBeZM0t4,1604000,1609279,a goal when you have a vision  everything becomes easy so people always
E0LvBeZM0t4,1609279,1615520,ask me  when they saw me in the gym in the  pumping iron days  they said why is it that you're working
E0LvBeZM0t4,1615520,1622960,out so hard  five hours a day six hours a day and you  have always a smile on your face
E0LvBeZM0t4,1622960,1629840,and i told people all the time i said  because to me  i am shooting for goal in front of me is
E0LvBeZM0t4,1629840,1635200,the mr universe title  so every rep that i do gets me closer to
E0LvBeZM0t4,1635200,1640880,accomplishing that goal to make this  core  this vision turn into reality every
E0LvBeZM0t4,1640880,1646720,single set that i do  every repetition every weight of the  lift will get me a step closer to
E0LvBeZM0t4,1646720,1651840,turn this goal into reality so i  couldn't wait to do another 500 pound
E0LvBeZM0t4,1651840,1658799,squat  i couldn't wait to do another 500 pound  bench press  i couldn't wait to do another 2 000 reps
E0LvBeZM0t4,1658799,1664399,of sit-ups  i couldn't wait for the next exercise  with the age of 20 i went to london and
E0LvBeZM0t4,1664399,1669600,i won the mr universe contest  as the youngest mr universe ever and it
E0LvBeZM0t4,1669600,1673919,was because  i had a goal
E0LvBeZM0t4,1674720,1680720,so let me tell you something visualizing  your goal and going after it  makes it fun you've got to have a
E0LvBeZM0t4,1680720,1686150,purpose no matter what you do in life  you've got to have a purpose
E0LvBeZM0t4,1686150,1694799,[Music]  74 percent hate their job in america
E0LvBeZM0t4,1694799,1701919,now there's not much different when you  come to europe the majority of people  don't like what they're doing because
E0LvBeZM0t4,1701919,1708000,they're really not doing it because they  didn't have a gourd and they followed  the score  they just aimlessly drifted around and
E0LvBeZM0t4,1708000,1714240,then all of a sudden there's a job  opening so they get their job  because you have to work but then when
E0LvBeZM0t4,1714240,1721600,you work  it's a chore it's work  it's not fun so if you think about only
E0LvBeZM0t4,1721600,1727679,a quarter of the people really enjoy  what they're doing  in life that is unbelievable if you
E0LvBeZM0t4,1727679,1734399,think about it so i felt so blessed that  i knew what i was doing  it's like a medical student that studies
E0LvBeZM0t4,1734399,1739520,and knows he wants to become a doctor  you know where to go and the same thing  is also
E0LvBeZM0t4,1739520,1746158,in politics i remember that in politics  i had a very clear vision
E0LvBeZM0t4,1746399,1753039,that i will be the leader of california  this is as far as i could go because i  was not born in america so i could not
E0LvBeZM0t4,1753039,1759520,run for president  so being the governor of the fifth  largest state
E0LvBeZM0t4,1759600,1766399,of i should say the largest state the  fifth largest economy  in the world was for me really
E0LvBeZM0t4,1766399,1772159,the ultimate title the ultimate  accomplishment in politics  so even though people came up to me and
E0LvBeZM0t4,1772159,1777760,says why don't you go  and run for something smaller you're  never gonna make it
E0LvBeZM0t4,1777760,1785279,i ran for governor and then two months  later i became governor of the state of  california  again because i had a very clear vision
E0LvBeZM0t4,1785279,1791520,what i'm gonna do with california  [Music]  [Applause]
E0LvBeZM0t4,1791520,1798080,so that's rule number one have a vision  rule number two is don't listen to the
E0LvBeZM0t4,1798080,1805070,naysayers  don't listen to the naysayers  [Applause]
E0LvBeZM0t4,1805070,1810720,[Music]  everything i ever did the thing that
E0LvBeZM0t4,1810720,1817039,they heard out of people's mouth was  that's impossible that can't be done
E0LvBeZM0t4,1817039,1823760,or no that is exactly what i heard and  of course i proved to the people that it  can't be done
E0LvBeZM0t4,1823760,1831360,so whenever someone said to me it can't  be done  i heard it can be done when they said no
E0LvBeZM0t4,1831360,1838559,i heard yes and when they said it's  impossible i heard  it is possible
E0LvBeZM0t4,1838640,1845279,i'm a strong believer what nelson  mandela said  that everything is always impossible
E0LvBeZM0t4,1845279,1850960,until  someone does it well i'm gonna be the  one that said to myself i'm gonna do it
E0LvBeZM0t4,1850960,1857039,and i'm gonna show it to them  maybe it has never been done before  that's perfectly fine with me
E0LvBeZM0t4,1857039,1863039,but i'm gonna do it and i did not listen  to the naysayers
E0LvBeZM0t4,1863360,1868720,it's all about the hard work that you  put in i said i must have been  bodybuilding i worked
E0LvBeZM0t4,1868720,1875360,out five six hours a day i'm gonna do  the same thing now for acting  [Music]
E0LvBeZM0t4,1875360,1884080,and of course i went to college to study  english  i studied the accent removal
E0LvBeZM0t4,1884080,1890840,acting classes and all of this stuff  all day long i worked and i worked and
E0LvBeZM0t4,1890840,1898080,worked  and within a short period of time i made  one movie called hercules in new york
E0LvBeZM0t4,1898080,1903919,which of course went right into the  toilet  but it didn't discourage me i still had
E0LvBeZM0t4,1903919,1909760,the same vision  and then all of a sudden i did streets  of san francisco
E0LvBeZM0t4,1909760,1915440,i did stay hungry and pumping on  and the villain and then all of a sudden
E0LvBeZM0t4,1915440,1923679,i was asked by dino de laurentiis  and the universal studio to star in  conan the barbarian
E0LvBeZM0t4,1923679,1928880,and after i did conan the barbarian the  director at the press conference said
E0LvBeZM0t4,1928880,1934240,to the press the director was john  millius
E0LvBeZM0t4,1934240,1940240,he said to the press if we wouldn't have  had arnold we would have had to build  one
E0LvBeZM0t4,1940240,1948240,so think about that  [Applause]  the very body that they said
E0LvBeZM0t4,1948240,1954559,can never be sold because the time is  wrong  a few years later i'm doing conan the
E0LvBeZM0t4,1954559,1961360,barbarian and it was the number one hit  at the box office when it came out in  the summer of 82.
E0LvBeZM0t4,1961360,1968480,think about that and the director says  if he wouldn't have had his body  we would have had to build one so all of
E0LvBeZM0t4,1968480,1974880,a sudden  my body became an asset not a liability  and the same thing was with terminator
E0LvBeZM0t4,1974880,1980000,after people finished filming terminator  jim cameron said to the press if arnold
E0LvBeZM0t4,1980000,1986320,wouldn't have had that  accent and talk like a machine i think  the movie wouldn't have worked
E0LvBeZM0t4,1986320,1994480,so think about that the body and the  accent  that they attacked was an asset
E0LvBeZM0t4,1994480,2000559,but i didn't listen to those losers  i didn't listen to them at all it's just
E0LvBeZM0t4,2000559,2007919,the reality of it is that you cannot  listen to the naysayers so this is a  very important lesson for all of you
E0LvBeZM0t4,2007919,2014480,so when someone says no this is a stupid  idea  you in your mind you don't have to say  it but you need mind just say this of
E0LvBeZM0t4,2014480,2023550,you you're so what do you know  [Applause]
