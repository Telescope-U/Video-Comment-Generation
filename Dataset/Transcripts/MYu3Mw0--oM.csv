MYu3Mw0--oM,160,2320,welcome to the new range rover sport i'm
MYu3Mw0--oM,2320,4400,rob mitchell and this is the new range
MYu3Mw0--oM,4400,5400,rover sport
MYu3Mw0--oM,5400,9910,[Music]
MYu3Mw0--oM,11440,13200,from the front you can see the muscular
MYu3Mw0--oM,13200,16080,stance dramatic proportions and short
MYu3Mw0--oM,16080,18560,overhangs these will add to the imposing
MYu3Mw0--oM,18560,21199,road presence and not forgetting the
MYu3Mw0--oM,21199,23279,optional 23-inch alloy wheels that come
MYu3Mw0--oM,23279,25279,in a variety of finishes
MYu3Mw0--oM,25279,27199,you can also see on the front end you've
MYu3Mw0--oM,27199,30720,got this lovely redefined look it's
MYu3Mw0--oM,30720,33360,reductive design languages land rover
MYu3Mw0--oM,33360,35040,range rover like to call it in the
MYu3Mw0--oM,35040,38000,headlights you've got 1.3 million tiny
MYu3Mw0--oM,38000,40399,little mirrors so it really adjusts the
MYu3Mw0--oM,40399,41920,light for the road and masks out the
MYu3Mw0--oM,41920,44000,bits that you don't want to blind people
MYu3Mw0--oM,44000,45360,with
MYu3Mw0--oM,45360,47120,also not forgetting the signature
MYu3Mw0--oM,47120,49120,daytime running light sweeps all the way
MYu3Mw0--oM,49120,53000,around the headlight there
MYu3Mw0--oM,53610,60909,[Music]
MYu3Mw0--oM,63199,64799,around the side of the vehicle you can
MYu3Mw0--oM,64799,68159,see the unmistakable range rover profile
MYu3Mw0--oM,68159,70560,with the gently falling off roof
MYu3Mw0--oM,70560,72479,and also the strong belt line running
MYu3Mw0--oM,72479,74640,all the way along the vehicle
MYu3Mw0--oM,74640,77040,you can also notice the upswept swirls
MYu3Mw0--oM,77040,79280,just gently at the bottom there
MYu3Mw0--oM,79280,80720,this vehicle has also increased its
MYu3Mw0--oM,80720,83280,wheelbase by 75 millimeters over the
MYu3Mw0--oM,83280,84960,previous generation cut
MYu3Mw0--oM,84960,87119,this also means that there's more room
MYu3Mw0--oM,87119,88960,in the rear for your passengers
MYu3Mw0--oM,88960,90640,and also improves the look of the
MYu3Mw0--oM,90640,93520,vehicle and also the proportions
MYu3Mw0--oM,93520,95280,you may also notice with the side of the
MYu3Mw0--oM,95280,97680,vehicle here the glass is now all lovely
MYu3Mw0--oM,97680,99520,and flush we've also got rid of the
MYu3Mw0--oM,99520,101600,finishes strip along here it's part of
MYu3Mw0--oM,101600,103840,the reductive design language so take
MYu3Mw0--oM,103840,106000,away any of the items that used to draw
MYu3Mw0--oM,106000,107600,your eye to it to make it all lovely and
MYu3Mw0--oM,107600,109920,flowing also you have got the hideaway
MYu3Mw0--oM,109920,111920,door handles that do vanish into the car
MYu3Mw0--oM,111920,113520,when it's locked or when you're driving
MYu3Mw0--oM,113520,115520,away this all helps remove that
MYu3Mw0--oM,115520,117759,unnecessary detail
MYu3Mw0--oM,117759,119119,you can also
MYu3Mw0--oM,119119,121280,see that the groove here is even more
MYu3Mw0--oM,121280,122399,pronounced
MYu3Mw0--oM,122399,125040,and that itself lines up with the bonnet
MYu3Mw0--oM,125040,127280,and goes all the way through the bonnet
MYu3Mw0--oM,127280,129599,shut line has now been made 50 smaller
MYu3Mw0--oM,129599,130560,as well
MYu3Mw0--oM,130560,131760,so it helps to get rid of those
MYu3Mw0--oM,131760,133599,unnecessary details which is a really
MYu3Mw0--oM,133599,135440,key part of the range rover design
MYu3Mw0--oM,135440,137760,language
MYu3Mw0--oM,137760,139920,now as you may notice this one is a
MYu3Mw0--oM,139920,142580,hybrid so let's talk about that
MYu3Mw0--oM,142580,152640,[Music]
MYu3Mw0--oM,152640,154160,the range rover sport is available with
MYu3Mw0--oM,154160,156239,two plug-in hybrid options both mated to
MYu3Mw0--oM,156239,158239,a petrol engine these have a range of up
MYu3Mw0--oM,158239,160879,to 70 miles and can charge using ac so a
MYu3Mw0--oM,160879,164080,type 2 plug or dc using the ccs plug so
MYu3Mw0--oM,164080,165760,that's a little bit bigger one
MYu3Mw0--oM,165760,167519,obviously if you're using dc you can go
MYu3Mw0--oM,167519,170239,from a little zero to 80 in under 60
MYu3Mw0--oM,170239,172400,minutes so it's really quick both of
MYu3Mw0--oM,172400,173840,these engines here that have an output
MYu3Mw0--oM,173840,178159,of 440 horsepower or also 510
MYu3Mw0--oM,178159,181040,in 2024 there is also a fully electric
MYu3Mw0--oM,181040,183360,vehicle coming as well so stay tuned for
MYu3Mw0--oM,183360,185840,that one if plug-in hybrid isn't really
MYu3Mw0--oM,185840,187840,what he is after we do also have two
MYu3Mw0--oM,187840,189599,diesel engine vehicles and these are
MYu3Mw0--oM,189599,191360,what they call a mild hybrid so you
MYu3Mw0--oM,191360,192560,don't need to plug them in they'll
MYu3Mw0--oM,192560,194480,charge as they drive and have power
MYu3Mw0--oM,194480,198800,outputs of 300 horsepower or 350
MYu3Mw0--oM,198800,200480,if you don't want any of that stuff we
MYu3Mw0--oM,200480,202879,also have the range top and v8 that is a
MYu3Mw0--oM,202879,205040,twin turbocharged petrol engine with an
MYu3Mw0--oM,205040,207920,output of 530 brake horsepower and not
MYu3Mw0--oM,207920,210879,to 60 time of 4.3 seconds and a top
MYu3Mw0--oM,210879,213290,speed of 155 miles per hour
MYu3Mw0--oM,213290,218560,[Music]
MYu3Mw0--oM,218560,220080,from the rear you can see the number
MYu3Mw0--oM,220080,221760,plate has been lowered and that's to
MYu3Mw0--oM,221760,223840,bring your eyes lower down so it really
MYu3Mw0--oM,223840,226720,gives it a lot of presence on the road
MYu3Mw0--oM,226720,229120,also that then encompasses the exhaust
MYu3Mw0--oM,229120,230720,pipes that are just down here and also
MYu3Mw0--oM,230720,232159,you've got a style of diffuser in the
MYu3Mw0--oM,232159,233519,middle just there
MYu3Mw0--oM,233519,235920,you may also notice the wrap around led
MYu3Mw0--oM,235920,237360,lights here with that signature
MYu3Mw0--oM,237360,239760,detailing and the lovely black badge
MYu3Mw0--oM,239760,242159,across the middle spraying off the range
MYu3Mw0--oM,242159,244080,rover badging
MYu3Mw0--oM,244080,246720,also as you notice it's very smooth it's
MYu3Mw0--oM,246720,248480,very clear there's no there's nothing
MYu3Mw0--oM,248480,251280,really in there to draw your eye to it
MYu3Mw0--oM,251280,252799,the detail has been really minimalized
MYu3Mw0--oM,252799,255040,part of the design language that land
MYu3Mw0--oM,255040,257040,rover are going for now
MYu3Mw0--oM,257040,258720,and also you may notice there's a
MYu3Mw0--oM,258720,260799,massive spoiler at the top here this
MYu3Mw0--oM,260799,262960,lovely flows in with the roof line as
MYu3Mw0--oM,262960,264880,well it just gently falls off at the
MYu3Mw0--oM,264880,267880,back
MYu3Mw0--oM,268760,274240,[Music]
MYu3Mw0--oM,274240,275919,this vehicle is finished in a gorgeous
MYu3Mw0--oM,275919,278240,pearl white with the contrast black roof
MYu3Mw0--oM,278240,280639,covers cars called austin nippell this
MYu3Mw0--oM,280639,282720,car comes in a whole host of colors and
MYu3Mw0--oM,282720,284720,there's a special fire nz red as well
MYu3Mw0--oM,284720,286960,really looks gorgeous you can also get
MYu3Mw0--oM,286960,289440,some satin finishes so there's a kind of
MYu3Mw0--oM,289440,291600,a color choice for everyone you can also
MYu3Mw0--oM,291600,293759,get some of the bronze detailing on the
MYu3Mw0--oM,293759,295680,front of this or replace with black as
MYu3Mw0--oM,295680,297840,well so certainly something for you to
MYu3Mw0--oM,297840,300080,have a look at on the configurator so
MYu3Mw0--oM,300080,302080,let's talk about the chassis now the
MYu3Mw0--oM,302080,303840,range rover sport is now available rear
MYu3Mw0--oM,303840,305840,wheel steer what this means is that the
MYu3Mw0--oM,305840,307039,front and rear wheels can turn
MYu3Mw0--oM,307039,309039,independently so when you're on the
MYu3Mw0--oM,309039,310639,motorway the front and rear wheels are
MYu3Mw0--oM,310639,312880,turned together effectively increasing
MYu3Mw0--oM,312880,314320,the wheelbase however if you're trying
MYu3Mw0--oM,314320,316560,to maneuver out tight parking bays
MYu3Mw0--oM,316560,318560,then they'll turn opposites
MYu3Mw0--oM,318560,320880,at up to 7.3 degrees what that means for
MYu3Mw0--oM,320880,322400,you though is that when you're in the
MYu3Mw0--oM,322400,324160,car park are you trying to get out this
MYu3Mw0--oM,324160,325600,effectively has a turning circle of a
MYu3Mw0--oM,325600,327680,small family hatchback so it's quite
MYu3Mw0--oM,327680,329120,incredible considering the size of the
MYu3Mw0--oM,329120,330000,vehicle
MYu3Mw0--oM,330000,331360,but that's not the only thing they've
MYu3Mw0--oM,331360,333520,done underneath the vehicle under here
MYu3Mw0--oM,333520,335120,you've got a new two-chamber air
MYu3Mw0--oM,335120,337680,suspension system so what does that mean
MYu3Mw0--oM,337680,338479,so
MYu3Mw0--oM,338479,340320,if you want your comfy suspension you
MYu3Mw0--oM,340320,341520,know when you're normally driving on the
MYu3Mw0--oM,341520,343600,road you've got that however if you're
MYu3Mw0--oM,343600,345199,driving hard and you're throwing it into
MYu3Mw0--oM,345199,346960,corners you've got the second air
MYu3Mw0--oM,346960,348160,suspension chamber which is a little bit
MYu3Mw0--oM,348160,350720,stiffer and that means it helps with the
MYu3Mw0--oM,350720,352639,pitch and the roll of the vehicle
MYu3Mw0--oM,352639,354320,effectively keeping you nice and level
MYu3Mw0--oM,354320,355600,obviously not forgetting about air
MYu3Mw0--oM,355600,357440,suspension means you can raise the
MYu3Mw0--oM,357440,358800,vehicle
MYu3Mw0--oM,358800,360400,as well as with the actual chassis of
MYu3Mw0--oM,360400,362080,the car they've also increased the
MYu3Mw0--oM,362080,363680,torsional stiffness of the vehicle by
MYu3Mw0--oM,363680,365039,about 35
MYu3Mw0--oM,365039,366639,so that means you can really feel the
MYu3Mw0--oM,366639,368479,vehicle but anyway enough for the
MYu3Mw0--oM,368479,372160,outside let's go on the inside
MYu3Mw0--oM,372960,376160,[Music]
MYu3Mw0--oM,376479,378639,so welcome to the interior of the new
MYu3Mw0--oM,378639,381120,range rover sport in here this is a
MYu3Mw0--oM,381120,383199,glorious place to sit you've got your

MYu3Mw0--oM,385199,387840,your 13.1 inch pivot pro screen here in
MYu3Mw0--oM,387840,388800,the middle
MYu3Mw0--oM,388800,391039,and you've also got the gorgeous
MYu3Mw0--oM,391039,394479,sumptuous alcantara headline in here
MYu3Mw0--oM,394479,396160,you can also see here you've got your
MYu3Mw0--oM,396160,398240,center console this has been raised up
MYu3Mw0--oM,398240,399759,to give that real sporty effect to
MYu3Mw0--oM,399759,402400,really make you feel inside the vehicle
MYu3Mw0--oM,402400,404639,it's all touch screen so literally you
MYu3Mw0--oM,404639,405840,can touch anything if you want your
MYu3Mw0--oM,405840,409039,navigation seat controls ventilation
MYu3Mw0--oM,409039,411199,massage functions all that sort of thing
MYu3Mw0--oM,411199,413039,it's all through here so it's one place
MYu3Mw0--oM,413039,414479,to go to everything which is definitely
MYu3Mw0--oM,414479,416800,what you want you've got your navigation
MYu3Mw0--oM,416800,418800,and that's also got the overlay on there
MYu3Mw0--oM,418800,421120,as well so you get a full prospective
MYu3Mw0--oM,421120,423759,view of actually what you're seeing
MYu3Mw0--oM,423759,425759,also with the vehicle first one for
MYu3Mw0--oM,425759,428479,ranger you've got animal free interior
MYu3Mw0--oM,428479,429759,so that's what they call the ultra
MYu3Mw0--oM,429759,431680,fabrics so if you don't want a leather
MYu3Mw0--oM,431680,433520,interior you can have an ultra fabrics
MYu3Mw0--oM,433520,435440,one and what that means is where there's
MYu3Mw0--oM,435440,437440,leather inside this car you can have
MYu3Mw0--oM,437440,439599,that all replaced with a vegan
MYu3Mw0--oM,439599,441120,alternative
MYu3Mw0--oM,441120,442720,it comes in a quite a wide range of
MYu3Mw0--oM,442720,444000,colors and also you get nice
MYu3Mw0--oM,444000,446080,perforations on the seat
MYu3Mw0--oM,446080,447919,with the headlining as well you can have
MYu3Mw0--oM,447919,449919,that in a contrast color so if you fancy
MYu3Mw0--oM,449919,451599,sound a little bit different to the
MYu3Mw0--oM,451599,453199,black of the lower part of the interior
MYu3Mw0--oM,453199,455440,you can do that as well
MYu3Mw0--oM,455440,456960,apart from that inside here it's a
MYu3Mw0--oM,456960,459120,glorious place to sit everything is as
MYu3Mw0--oM,459120,460400,you'd want it with a range rover you've
MYu3Mw0--oM,460400,463120,got really commanding driving position
MYu3Mw0--oM,463120,465199,in the back they've got plenty of room
MYu3Mw0--oM,465199,467039,and also with the electric seat on the
MYu3Mw0--oM,467039,468560,passenger side you've got a chauffeur
MYu3Mw0--oM,468560,470400,mode it may sound like a bit of a
MYu3Mw0--oM,470400,472639,gimmick but what that does what
MYu3Mw0--oM,472639,474319,one touch that literally just slides to
MYu3Mw0--oM,474319,476400,seat all the way forwards for you so it
MYu3Mw0--oM,476400,477840,gives a person in the back a lot more
MYu3Mw0--oM,477840,479120,room
MYu3Mw0--oM,479120,480720,otherwise interior wise you've got a
MYu3Mw0--oM,480720,482879,natural wood veneer on the panels here
MYu3Mw0--oM,482879,484639,and also on the dashboard you've also
MYu3Mw0--oM,484639,487199,got a striking chrome detail across here
MYu3Mw0--oM,487199,489440,you can also have that but instead of
MYu3Mw0--oM,489440,491520,the wood you can have a forged carbon
MYu3Mw0--oM,491520,492800,fiber and that's the first time they've
MYu3Mw0--oM,492800,495360,done that on the range rover sport
MYu3Mw0--oM,495360,496879,obviously this one has also got the
MYu3Mw0--oM,496879,498560,panameric sunroof which at the moment
MYu3Mw0--oM,498560,500479,got open so it adds a lot more light
MYu3Mw0--oM,500479,502720,into the vehicle but you can charge if
MYu3Mw0--oM,502720,504560,you wanted to and you've got the

MYu3Mw0--oM,510479,512640,have cleaner air inside the vehicle than
MYu3Mw0--oM,512640,514640,you ever could outside so it's certainly
MYu3Mw0--oM,514640,515760,a good one if you especially if you
MYu3Mw0--oM,515760,517279,suffer with hay fever and things like
