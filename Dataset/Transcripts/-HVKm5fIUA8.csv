-HVKm5fIUA8,240,6879,A computer mouse without a scroll wheel is  ridiculous. It’s like having a TV without a remote  
-HVKm5fIUA8,6880,14320,"control. Yes, you might be able to make it work,  but is it really worth the effort? Well, in this  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,14320,20320,"episode we’re going to explore the scroll wheel  in detail. First, we’ll examine two different  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,20320,26640,"technologies used to measure the direction and  speed of rotation, and after that, we’ll see what  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,26640,34320,"causes some to have a stepped or clicking motion  versus spinning smoothly. So, let’s jump right in. "
-HVKm5fIUA8,34320,38800,"This video is sponsored by  PCBWay, more on them later. "
-HVKm5fIUA8,39520,46960,Scroll wheels commonly use either optical rotary  encoders or magnetic rotary position sensors  
-HVKm5fIUA8,46960,52720,in order to measure rotational motion. They’re  functionally equivalent in that they both measure  
-HVKm5fIUA8,52720,59520,"rotation, but technically different, as one uses  light and optics, while the other uses magnets. "
-HVKm5fIUA8,60800,67440,Let’s first explore the optical rotary encoder.  It has three key components. First is an  
-HVKm5fIUA8,67440,74400,"infrared LED that emits light and a lens that  focuses it. Next, there’s a pair of optical  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,74400,80000,"sensors that detect the light, and finally,  mounted on the inside of the scroll wheel,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,80000,86800,"there’s an encoding disk with 48 equally spaced  spokes which rotate when you spin the wheel,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,86800,92480,"kind of like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. The key to the optical rotary encoder is that,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,92480,99840,"as the wheel is rotated, the light emitted from  the IR LED is intermittently blocked by the  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,99840,106640,encoding disk. The light that makes it through the  slots between the spokes reaches these two optical  
-HVKm5fIUA8,106640,114159,"sensors and is converted into an electrical signal  called a pulse wave or pulse train, and with every  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,114160,121760,"full rotation of the wheel, each sensor sees  48 pulses of light resulting in 48 electrical  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,121760,127920,"puls-es. Let’s spin this wheel rather quickly.  Within each hundredth of a second, the sensors  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,127920,134720,"see 12 pulses of light and using the generated  pulse train, the processor calculates that the  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,134720,141520,wheel is spinning at 25 rotations a second and  then sends this information to the computer.  
-HVKm5fIUA8,141520,148720,"The information is not speed, however, but  rather, the angular distance measured in degrees  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,148720,154720,and the direction the scroll wheel has travelled  every hundredth to a thousandth of a second.  
-HVKm5fIUA8,154720,160960,This angular distance and direction can then be  used by the operating system and its software  
-HVKm5fIUA8,160960,167920,to know how far up or down to move in a website  or application. But how does the scroll wheel  
-HVKm5fIUA8,167920,174560,"know which direction it’s rotating? Well, the  two sensors are spaced next to one another, and,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,174560,180640,"depending on the direction the wheel is rotating,  one sensor sees the light before the other.  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,180640,186400,"For example, if you scroll the wheel down,  the pulse train from the two adjacent sensors  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,186400,193680,"will look like this, whereas when you scroll the  wheel up, it will look like this. By the way,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,193680,199120,this is technically called an incremental  quadrature encoder. It’s called an encoder  
-HVKm5fIUA8,199120,205680,"because the term encoding means to convert one  form of data into another form, and in this case,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,205680,211359,we’re turning mechanical rotational motion  first into an electrical pulse train and  
-HVKm5fIUA8,211360,217600,"then into speed, distance, and direction. Let’s move on to the other type of scroll wheel,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,217600,223520,"the magnetic rotary position sensor.  Instead of using light and a bunch of slits,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,223520,229680,"this scroll wheel has a magnet mounted to it, and  next to the wheel is a microchip that contains  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,229680,236159,"two magnetic field sensors, called Hall Effect  Sensors, which are used to detect the magnetic  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,236160,242720,field strength and the rotational position of the  magnet. How do these sensors work? Well in each  
-HVKm5fIUA8,242720,249280,sensor we have a very small plate of metal or  semiconductor with electrons flowing across it.  
-HVKm5fIUA8,249280,255360,A basic law of physics called the Lorentz force  is that all moving charged particles such as  
-HVKm5fIUA8,255360,261760,electrons are affected by magnetic fields. When  moving electrons are introduced to a magnetic  
-HVKm5fIUA8,261760,268080,"field with this orientation, they’re deflected  to-ward the bottom of the plate or, if we flip the  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,268080,273840,"direction of the magnetic field by rotating the  magnet, they’re deflected to the top of the plate.  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,273840,279840,"With the electrons concentrated at one side of the  plate because of the magnetic field, we just need  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,279840,284960,to add a few wires and additional circuitry  in order to measure the voltage difference  
-HVKm5fIUA8,284960,291600,"between the top and bottom of the metal plate.  As the magnet rotates, the electrons are pushed  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,291600,297760,"to one side of the plate and then the other, and  the voltage flips from positive to negative and  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,297760,304960,back again in a sinusoidal shape. This swing in  voltage is then used to determine rotational speed  
-HVKm5fIUA8,304960,311199,"and angular distance travelled. However, a single  Hall Effect Sensor can’t tell us the direction of  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,311200,318080,"rotation, and therefore in this micro-chip we have  two Hall Effect sensors, positioned perpendicular  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,318080,324479,to one another and labelled X and Y. With two  sensors we’re able to determine the absolute  
-HVKm5fIUA8,324480,331920,"angular position of the scroll wheel because for  every different angle, from 0 to 359 degrees,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,331920,339280,there’s a unique combination of voltages on the  X and Y magnetic sensors. The microchip over here  
-HVKm5fIUA8,339280,345120,records the exact angular position every  thousandth of a second and compares it with  
-HVKm5fIUA8,345120,350960,"the previous position. Then, using the difference  in angles and the time between measurements,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,350960,357280,"the mouse determines the speed, angular distance  travelled, and direction of movement, and sends  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,357280,363440,"it to the computer. There are a few things to  note. First, the incremental optical encoder  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,363440,370480,from earlier can’t read out an absolute angular  position because the wheel has 48 equally spaced  
-HVKm5fIUA8,370480,377360,"spokes, and it can’t discern one angle from the  next. However, it is possible to have an absolute  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,377360,383199,"optical encoder which has a disk that looks  like this, where different angles have different  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,383200,389360,sections open to let the light through. It’s also  interesting to note that the physics of magnetic  
-HVKm5fIUA8,389360,395840,"fields deflecting moving electrons, called the  Lorentz Force, is the driving principle behind  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,395840,402480,"all electric motors, just with coils of wires  and different configurations of magnetic fields."
-HVKm5fIUA8,402480,409760,Let’s move on and look at two additional features.  Here we have the scroll wheel assembly below which  
-HVKm5fIUA8,409760,415360,you’ll most likely find a push button. When you  push down on the scroll wheel it triggers the  
-HVKm5fIUA8,415360,422319,"button, and when you release it, the plastic, or  sometimes a spring, pushes the assembly back up.  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,422960,429039,Most scroll wheels have some type of mechanism  to create the clicking-like motion and sound  
-HVKm5fIUA8,429040,434880,"as the scroll wheel rotates. A common way  this is done is to have a ring of ridges,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,434880,441680,"a spring, and a small plastic follower that rides  along the ridges. When this button is pressed,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,442560,449040,the motor turns and rotates to engage the follower  so that it presses against the ridges. As you  
-HVKm5fIUA8,449040,454960,"rotate the wheel, the plastic moves up and  down the ridges thereby creating a stepped  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,454960,461520,"or chattering motion, and the spring applies a  very light force so that the plastic follower  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,461520,467280,"stays in contact with the ridges. If you spin  the wheel quickly, the plastic will continue to  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,467280,472800,"move up and down, and slow the wheel faster than  if the follower were not pressing up against the  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,472800,479199,plastic and the scroll wheel was spinning freely. One thing to note is that in this video we covered  
-HVKm5fIUA8,479200,486000,just two methods to measure rotational motion: an  optical encoder and a magnetic position encoder.  
-HVKm5fIUA8,486000,492160,"There are thousands of designs of computer mice,  and dozens of different ways to measure rotation.  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,492160,499040,Other methods include a potentiometer which uses  a resistive track and a wiper that results in a  
-HVKm5fIUA8,499040,505920,change in electrical resistance. Older or cheaper  mice use two push buttons and an attachment on the  
-HVKm5fIUA8,505920,511760,"wheel that actuates these buttons. Additionally,  there are different methods for registering a  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,511760,518000,"scroll wheel push and for creating different  aesthetics when you rotate the mouse. For example,  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,518560,524560,this scroll wheel uses an electro-permanent  magnet and teeth that conduct magnetic fields  
-HVKm5fIUA8,524560,529760,resulting in the wheel stepping from tooth to  tooth. There are many other designs that we  
-HVKm5fIUA8,529760,535120,"didn’t cover in this video, but if you have a  broken mouse, we encourage you to take a look. "
-HVKm5fIUA8,535920,542720,"Printed circuit boards or PCBs are everywhere  and inside this mouse, you can find four of them.  "
-HVKm5fIUA8,542720,548560,They may look complicated but they’re pretty fun  to design and purchasing them is made incredibly  
-HVKm5fIUA8,548560,557279,easy by our sponsor PCBWay. PCBWay can quickly  manufacture your PCBs with competitive prices
