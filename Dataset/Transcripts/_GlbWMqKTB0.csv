_GlbWMqKTB0,40399,42160,so this property here the client didn't
_GlbWMqKTB0,42160,43200,actually want to be able to see the
_GlbWMqKTB0,43200,46160,racks now we had these well this area
_GlbWMqKTB0,46160,47840,here which is in the hallway which is
_GlbWMqKTB0,47840,49440,where we originally had our rack and
_GlbWMqKTB0,49440,51280,termination box however the problem was
_GlbWMqKTB0,51280,53280,with the rack it actually poked out a
_GlbWMqKTB0,53280,55120,little bit far and the climb wanted to
_GlbWMqKTB0,55120,56960,be nice and smooth back so if i open up

_GlbWMqKTB0,62800,65920,rack was originally below here however
_GlbWMqKTB0,65920,67600,once you feed it the client didn't like
_GlbWMqKTB0,67600,68400,it

_GlbWMqKTB0,232560,233519,little bit and it's probably going to be
_GlbWMqKTB0,233519,234959,dark now i might get my phone's heart
_GlbWMqKTB0,234959,236879,child but if cam can just get peered
_GlbWMqKTB0,236879,238159,into there
_GlbWMqKTB0,238159,240159,what you can actually see we've got is
_GlbWMqKTB0,240159,241519,on the rails that come on the back of
_GlbWMqKTB0,241519,243439,this we've got two tails which are
_GlbWMqKTB0,243439,245599,hanging the cables now you can actually
_GlbWMqKTB0,245599,248159,get trays which hold the cables like a
_GlbWMqKTB0,248159,250640,cable tray that run up uh over it
_GlbWMqKTB0,250640,252640,however on this one we decided not to so
_GlbWMqKTB0,252640,254560,let's get this rack back in and we can
_GlbWMqKTB0,254560,256000,crack on i can have a look at some of
_GlbWMqKTB0,256000,258639,the other rooms
_GlbWMqKTB0,259398,266479,[Music]
_GlbWMqKTB0,266479,267840,so just going to give you a look now at
_GlbWMqKTB0,267840,270160,this multi-use cinema slash media room
_GlbWMqKTB0,270160,272080,that i've got this project now of course
_GlbWMqKTB0,272080,274400,it's controlled by a neo remote control
_GlbWMqKTB0,274400,275440,what you can actually see on there at
_GlbWMqKTB0,275440,279520,the minute is a 65 inch sony ag9 tv so
_GlbWMqKTB0,279520,281280,if we just wanted to watch tv in normal
_GlbWMqKTB0,281280,282880,instance we could come on to the neo
_GlbWMqKTB0,282880,284560,remote control
_GlbWMqKTB0,284560,287680,can can we just bring this in
_GlbWMqKTB0,287919,289280,so i can come on to the new remote
_GlbWMqKTB0,289280,291440,control or tell it wanting to watch on
_GlbWMqKTB0,291440,292960,tv
_GlbWMqKTB0,292960,294320,netflix
_GlbWMqKTB0,294320,295520,so that's going to do now it's going to
_GlbWMqKTB0,295520,297280,turn the tv on it's going to switch it
_GlbWMqKTB0,297280,298960,over onto the netflix source and it's
_GlbWMqKTB0,298960,300160,going to fire up the surround sound
_GlbWMqKTB0,300160,302479,system because you may or may not be
_GlbWMqKTB0,302479,304479,able to see over there on the screen
_GlbWMqKTB0,304479,305919,but we've actually got some color
_GlbWMqKTB0,305919,308080,matched speakers and we've got a triad
_GlbWMqKTB0,308080,309440,bronze
_GlbWMqKTB0,309440,311360,five point one point two sam around
_GlbWMqKTB0,311360,312880,sound system in here sorry five point
_GlbWMqKTB0,312880,314639,two point two because we've got the two
_GlbWMqKTB0,314639,317280,subs we've got the lcr
_GlbWMqKTB0,317280,319120,strong channels at the back and then
_GlbWMqKTB0,319120,320400,we've got the high channels for the
_GlbWMqKTB0,320400,322880,atmos up top here now because that you
_GlbWMqKTB0,322880,323759,can probably see that's a little bit
_GlbWMqKTB0,323759,325120,glary so i'm gonna do i'm just gonna
_GlbWMqKTB0,325120,327919,shut these curtains down
_GlbWMqKTB0,327919,329600,so now i've got the tv on we've got our
_GlbWMqKTB0,329600,332240,netflix on there but let's see
_GlbWMqKTB0,332240,333759,let's come on so here
_GlbWMqKTB0,333759,336240,let's see we're watching our film
_GlbWMqKTB0,336240,338720,and we thought you know what
_GlbWMqKTB0,338720,340960,this is great yeah this is great this is
_GlbWMqKTB0,340960,342080,wonderful
_GlbWMqKTB0,342080,343600,but
_GlbWMqKTB0,343600,344880,i want something a little bit more
_GlbWMqKTB0,344880,345919,special
_GlbWMqKTB0,345919,348320,so if i come back into the watch menu
_GlbWMqKTB0,348320,350960,and can we see ourselves on there
_GlbWMqKTB0,350960,352400,you can see that i've got a watch on
_GlbWMqKTB0,352400,354160,projector button
_GlbWMqKTB0,354160,355680,so if i press that what's actually going
_GlbWMqKTB0,355680,357360,to happen is screen's dropping down
_GlbWMqKTB0,357360,359759,behind me we've got a future automation
_GlbWMqKTB0,359759,361680,projector lift just up here
_GlbWMqKTB0,361680,363120,and what that's doing is that's bringing
_GlbWMqKTB0,363120,366080,down the projector from the ceiling the
_GlbWMqKTB0,366080,367600,audio is going to stay rooted through
_GlbWMqKTB0,367600,368639,the speakers because we've got the
_GlbWMqKTB0,368639,370720,surround sound system in here in a
_GlbWMqKTB0,370720,372319,couple of seconds once that lamp is
_GlbWMqKTB0,372319,374319,fired up in there um because this is a
_GlbWMqKTB0,374319,377520,lamp based projector this is a sony 570
_GlbWMqKTB0,377520,379600,once that is fired up
_GlbWMqKTB0,379600,381680,we've got that exact same seam playing
_GlbWMqKTB0,381680,382880,on there because we're using the watch
_GlbWMqKTB0,382880,385199,on projector now again we could have an
_GlbWMqKTB0,385199,386720,automatic curtain track in here there's
_GlbWMqKTB0,386720,388560,a curtain just behind me there and as if
_GlbWMqKTB0,388560,390400,just by magic
_GlbWMqKTB0,390400,392240,so yes so we can watch our film on here
_GlbWMqKTB0,392240,395199,and sit back kick back and relax
_GlbWMqKTB0,395199,397280,now when we finish with this room all
_GlbWMqKTB0,397280,398639,we're going to do
_GlbWMqKTB0,398639,400160,is we've got the screen down projector
_GlbWMqKTB0,400160,400960,down
_GlbWMqKTB0,400960,403039,everything's turned on basically if you
_GlbWMqKTB0,403039,405520,just come to the room press on there
_GlbWMqKTB0,405520,407039,enable the room off do you want to turn
_GlbWMqKTB0,407039,408639,room off yes i do
_GlbWMqKTB0,408639,410000,everything's going to go away
_GlbWMqKTB0,410000,411520,everything's going to switch off and i
_GlbWMqKTB0,411520,413039,can put my mouth on the side and leave
_GlbWMqKTB0,413039,416199,the room
_GlbWMqKTB0,418140,429200,[Music]
_GlbWMqKTB0,429280,430479,so in this room here you'd actually
_GlbWMqKTB0,430479,433199,never know but we have two the diva se
_GlbWMqKTB0,433199,435520,speakers on top of these cupboards here
_GlbWMqKTB0,435520,436560,now
_GlbWMqKTB0,436560,438560,the gallows speakers sound great however
_GlbWMqKTB0,438560,440000,what makes them sound
_GlbWMqKTB0,440000,441680,absolutely incredible is paired up with
_GlbWMqKTB0,441680,443840,a sub now i'm not truly aesthetic in a
_GlbWMqKTB0,443840,445759,house like this you don't want subs on
_GlbWMqKTB0,445759,446800,display
_GlbWMqKTB0,446800,448240,however
_GlbWMqKTB0,448240,450240,this fabric on here is acoustically
_GlbWMqKTB0,450240,452560,transparent
_GlbWMqKTB0,452560,454639,and we have a galore sub hidden down at
_GlbWMqKTB0,454639,456639,the bottom there so in this room here
_GlbWMqKTB0,456639,460160,you even get the quality base
_GlbWMqKTB0,460639,462639,so in this room here is the sitting room
_GlbWMqKTB0,462639,464479,and it's actually one of only three
_GlbWMqKTB0,464479,466479,locations in this house where we've got
_GlbWMqKTB0,466479,468240,interior speakers
_GlbWMqKTB0,468240,469759,um the reason we've gone for the ceiling
_GlbWMqKTB0,469759,471360,speakers in here is for the depth and
_GlbWMqKTB0,471360,473280,because of the curving uh because we
_GlbWMqKTB0,473280,474800,have the depth of ceiling speakers so in
_GlbWMqKTB0,474800,475840,all the other rooms in the house went
_GlbWMqKTB0,475840,478240,for gallery acoustics apart from three i
_GlbWMqKTB0,478240,479680,am so the 16 tons of all the other there
_GlbWMqKTB0,479680,481840,is just three i'm not seeing speakers
_GlbWMqKTB0,481840,483280,which is this beautiful sitting room
_GlbWMqKTB0,483280,485520,here we have the bar just behind us
_GlbWMqKTB0,485520,487199,we've got a colour matched speaker which
_GlbWMqKTB0,487199,488400,i'm going to show you in a second and
_GlbWMqKTB0,488400,489759,then also we've got one of the ensuites
_GlbWMqKTB0,489759,491680,upstairs and aside from that it's gala
_GlbWMqKTB0,491680,493700,acoustic speakers everywhere
_GlbWMqKTB0,493700,497260,[Music]
_GlbWMqKTB0,498319,500080,now what we've got in here is actually
_GlbWMqKTB0,500080,502479,the entrance hall well a little side
_GlbWMqKTB0,502479,503599,hallway
_GlbWMqKTB0,503599,505199,and you can see we've got the higg blue
_GlbWMqKTB0,505199,506400,match beaker
_GlbWMqKTB0,506400,508319,on the ceiling there so this is a dual
_GlbWMqKTB0,508319,509840,tweeter speaker and it's been colour
_GlbWMqKTB0,509840,513198,matched for the space
_GlbWMqKTB0,516080,518080,so this kitchen here we've got the t4
_GlbWMqKTB0,518080,519839,touchscreen that's controlling the
_GlbWMqKTB0,519839,522240,lighting the music the heating the
_GlbWMqKTB0,522240,524640,security the intercom the shades the
_GlbWMqKTB0,524640,526880,gate absolutely everything these can
_GlbWMqKTB0,526880,528480,also be quick action
_GlbWMqKTB0,528480,530640,via the keypad that i've got here
_GlbWMqKTB0,530640,531839,on the next visit we're going to replace
_GlbWMqKTB0,531839,534800,these buttons for black buttons with uh
_GlbWMqKTB0,534800,539279,facebook keypads check out the next area
_GlbWMqKTB0,539360,541040,so as well as having the gallows in here
_GlbWMqKTB0,541040,542320,we've obviously got them paired to the
_GlbWMqKTB0,542320,544080,tv however they can't just be used to
_GlbWMqKTB0,544080,546480,listen to music but also on the neo
_GlbWMqKTB0,546480,548240,we've got the watch menu so watch listen
_GlbWMqKTB0,548240,550480,and security so listen if i wanted to
_GlbWMqKTB0,550480,552640,get access to music watch if i wanted
_GlbWMqKTB0,552640,554640,the tv on what should go for let's have
_GlbWMqKTB0,554640,556320,apple tv
_GlbWMqKTB0,556320,558320,so the tv is going to fire up and that's
_GlbWMqKTB0,558320,560399,brought on apple tv behind me i've got
_GlbWMqKTB0,560399,562800,control via the neo
_GlbWMqKTB0,562800,564800,also in this room last but not least for
_GlbWMqKTB0,564800,566480,the 5.1 as part of that surround sound
_GlbWMqKTB0,566480,568160,system if cam just follows me around
_GlbWMqKTB0,568160,569360,here and has a little look behind the
_GlbWMqKTB0,569360,570480,sofa
_GlbWMqKTB0,570480,572560,so we've got here is a custom color
_GlbWMqKTB0,572560,574720,profile sub which we had custom made by
_GlbWMqKTB0,574720,576240,a gal acoustics that just blend in with
_GlbWMqKTB0,576240,577760,that wall nicely
_GlbWMqKTB0,577760,580480,proper room
_GlbWMqKTB0,587440,588880,so this boot room actually houses a
_GlbWMqKTB0,588880,592560,little bit of a surprise because
_GlbWMqKTB0,592560,594230,if i move this cushion
_GlbWMqKTB0,594230,595760,[Applause]
_GlbWMqKTB0,595760,597839,pull it off to a side and i put actually
_GlbWMqKTB0,597839,601200,pull on hook number one
_GlbWMqKTB0,602399,605120,so that is the lighting panel now this
_GlbWMqKTB0,605120,606720,lighting panel serves all the kitchen
_GlbWMqKTB0,606720,608720,and downstairs hallway area and we
_GlbWMqKTB0,608720,610320,haven't got light in the full of this
_GlbWMqKTB0,610320,612800,house i'm just in the kitchen downstairs
_GlbWMqKTB0,612800,614480,area however the way that's been why we
_GlbWMqKTB0,614480,619000,could expand it a little later today
_GlbWMqKTB0,620880,622800,oh and i did take the cover off just
_GlbWMqKTB0,622800,626320,before this video to show you that
_GlbWMqKTB0,626399,627760,so in this entrance hall here we've
_GlbWMqKTB0,627760,629680,actually got a chime video doorbell as
_GlbWMqKTB0,629680,630959,well as a camera to see who's at the
_GlbWMqKTB0,630959,632959,door now the chime actually has a camera
_GlbWMqKTB0,632959,634800,built in however we're supplementing
_GlbWMqKTB0,634800,637980,this with the heat vision cameras
_GlbWMqKTB0,637980,643920,[Music]
_GlbWMqKTB0,643920,646800,so we haven't got just one
_GlbWMqKTB0,646800,647920,or two
_GlbWMqKTB0,647920,650160,but three outdoor zones at this property
_GlbWMqKTB0,650160,651760,um as you can tell the clients are the
_GlbWMqKTB0,651760,653920,old man so we have the kitchen patio
_GlbWMqKTB0,653920,654990,zone
_GlbWMqKTB0,654990,657440,[Music]
_GlbWMqKTB0,657440,659279,we've got this zone here at the back of
_GlbWMqKTB0,659279,660399,the sitting room
_GlbWMqKTB0,660399,662800,which over this beautiful space here
_GlbWMqKTB0,662800,664640,covers the fire pit and the outdoor
_GlbWMqKTB0,664640,665760,jacuzzi
_GlbWMqKTB0,665760,668240,and then finally just around this corner
_GlbWMqKTB0,668240,670160,leading over to the tennis courts we
_GlbWMqKTB0,670160,672000,have another outdoor zone on the side
_GlbWMqKTB0,672000,674880,here so no matter where you are in this
_GlbWMqKTB0,674880,677360,absolutely beautiful garden we've got
_GlbWMqKTB0,677360,679000,audio everywhere
_GlbWMqKTB0,679000,683120,[Music]
_GlbWMqKTB0,683120,684640,so you may think we've changed locations
_GlbWMqKTB0,684640,686320,and we haven't just before i leave i
_GlbWMqKTB0,686320,688079,want to show you this next bit this is
_GlbWMqKTB0,688079,689519,actually a next phase that we're about
_GlbWMqKTB0,689519,691519,to start i'm and we're actually
_GlbWMqKTB0,691519,693200,installing some additional cameras and
_GlbWMqKTB0,693200,695279,some music by this newly fitted pool
_GlbWMqKTB0,695279,697040,that's just getting fitted out
_GlbWMqKTB0,697040,700079,i can't wait for a dip
_GlbWMqKTB0,700640,702399,so as well as doing all the cool stuff
_GlbWMqKTB0,702399,705040,inside the house we also did a video
_GlbWMqKTB0,705040,708000,intercom an electric gate system
_GlbWMqKTB0,708000,709440,so this is connected through into the
_GlbWMqKTB0,709440,711120,control 4 system
_GlbWMqKTB0,711120,712800,and then the client actually went one
_GlbWMqKTB0,712800,715040,step further and we put in this
_GlbWMqKTB0,715040,718399,completely custom gate post here
_GlbWMqKTB0,718399,720720,with the video intercom in this custom
_GlbWMqKTB0,720720,722240,stone pillar
_GlbWMqKTB0,722240,723760,so hopefully you've enjoyed the tour on
_GlbWMqKTB0,723760,726000,this absolutely beautiful manor house in
_GlbWMqKTB0,726000,727760,wales now and hopefully it gives an
_GlbWMqKTB0,727760,730240,example of not always the technology on
_GlbWMqKTB0,730240,732639,display a lot of times work really hard
_GlbWMqKTB0,732639,734720,to make these solutions invisible now
