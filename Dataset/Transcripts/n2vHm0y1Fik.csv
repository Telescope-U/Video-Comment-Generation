n2vHm0y1Fik,160,5040,apple is bringing back a legendary product that changed the whole 
n2vHm0y1Fik,5600,7520,world i know some of you teens and young 
n2vHm0y1Fik,7520,13040,adults don't even know about this but today we will take a step back in time 
n2vHm0y1Fik,13040,20320,and see how steve jobs shocked everybody and everybody was on this new tech we'll 
n2vHm0y1Fik,20320,24400,talk about what it is when it's going to come out and how it is going to be 
n2vHm0y1Fik,24400,33360,affecting the new m2 max let's go ahead and jump right back in time back in 1999 
n2vHm0y1Fik,33360,42400,steve jobs went on stage and showed off the ibook g3 this was a colorful laptop 
n2vHm0y1Fik,42400,47440,it looks really funky and weird today but looked really awesome back then go 
n2vHm0y1Fik,47440,50800,ahead and let me know down below if you're somebody that has used one of 
n2vHm0y1Fik,50800,56239,these macbooks now not only did it have unique features like a built-in handle 
n2vHm0y1Fik,56240,61040,to make it much easier to carry it also had one secret feature that we'll talk 
n2vHm0y1Fik,61040,66320,about in a sec it also had pretty good performance especially for the price tag 
n2vHm0y1Fik,66320,71760,where apple priced it lower than the competitors while offering a lot more 
n2vHm0y1Fik,71760,77120,bang for the buck that kind of sounds like the m1 macbook air to me right now 
n2vHm0y1Fik,77120,81520,where it's cheaper and better than all of the competition in that category 
n2vHm0y1Fik,81520,85920,after steve gave all of the specs and then showed off different versions of 
n2vHm0y1Fik,85920,90720,television ads that they would do back in the day he came out with his 
n2vHm0y1Fik,90720,93040,legendary well but there is one more thing 
n2vHm0y1Fik,94080,98160,there is one more thing let me just show this to you for a minute okay okay come 
n2vHm0y1Fik,98160,102880,on up here i just want to show you this working he brought a cameraman on stage 
n2vHm0y1Fik,102880,109200,and proceeded to open up the laptop and he connected to the internet which was 
n2vHm0y1Fik,109200,115680,completely normal but then he busted out the hula hoop and the crowd went 
n2vHm0y1Fik,116480,122640,nuts so what did he do with them well he spun it through and all around 
n2vHm0y1Fik,122640,129920,the laptop while being connected to the internet something that was never done 
n2vHm0y1Fik,129920,134400,before yes apple was the very first company to 
n2vHm0y1Fik,134400,140720,release a laptop with wireless networking most of us our age my age and 
n2vHm0y1Fik,140720,145760,younger didn't even know this and in the following years they changed the world 
n2vHm0y1Fik,145760,151280,with this new laptop and this new networking that they were including 
n2vHm0y1Fik,151280,157440,everybody from teachers students people at home were switching to wi-fi and 
n2vHm0y1Fik,157440,163280,enjoying the freedom that it gave now in order to make this possible they needed 
n2vHm0y1Fik,163280,168959,networking a wi-fi router to allow people to connect to and to make it easy 
n2vHm0y1Fik,168960,174720,which is where this flying saucer comes in now apple wasn't the first company to 
n2vHm0y1Fik,174720,179040,make a wi-fi router but they were the ones that really pushed this whole 
n2vHm0y1Fik,179040,184000,technology forward the airport base station looked funky but it gave you 
n2vHm0y1Fik,184000,187680,everything you need with the modem inside connectivity with a bunch of 
n2vHm0y1Fik,187680,193920,devices good range very easy to use and it actually had the fastest speed that 
n2vHm0y1Fik,193920,198400,just came out for wireless connectivity it was 10 times faster than before so if 
n2vHm0y1Fik,198400,202239,apple made the first laptop with wi-fi and they really revolutionized this 
n2vHm0y1Fik,202240,207600,whole industry what's happening today well four years ago apple officially 
n2vHm0y1Fik,207600,214240,discontinued their lineup of airport extreme and time capsules which i'll 
n2vHm0y1Fik,214240,218320,talk about in a sec and they just dump this whole market we're gonna talk about 
n2vHm0y1Fik,218320,222720,why they did that why it's coming back and how we know and how it's gonna 
n2vHm0y1Fik,222720,227760,affect these brand new macs coming out what changes those are going to bring 
n2vHm0y1Fik,227760,231680,this info that we have is coming from imagine boo and if you're wondering well 
n2vHm0y1Fik,231680,236799,who the heck is that this is a guy that covers a lot of information leaks a lot 
n2vHm0y1Fik,236800,240480,of software stuff that we've actually covered in the past and if you don't 
n2vHm0y1Fik,240480,245360,think he's credible check this out he was actually the first person to talk 
n2vHm0y1Fik,245360,250240,about mixer software that apple is developing to bring a mac os like 
n2vHm0y1Fik,250240,255280,experience to the ipads that we covered now this came out we were hoping that it 
n2vHm0y1Fik,255280,260560,is true and then just a little bit later patents were released and approved 
n2vHm0y1Fik,260560,266080,showing this whole interface how you'll be able to connect your ipad to a 
n2vHm0y1Fik,266080,271759,keyboard and get a mac os like experience so apple's patents backed up 
n2vHm0y1Fik,271760,276160,what he was talking about in terms of software now on top of that steve trott 
n2vHm0y1Fik,276160,282400,and smith just put out this information talking about webkit and how it just had 
n2vHm0y1Fik,282400,288160,extra infrastructure added to allow for a multi-tasking mode on ios that looks 
n2vHm0y1Fik,288160,292240,like it's a system toggle that enables freely resizable windows now we know 
n2vHm0y1Fik,292240,298800,wwdc is coming out we are going to get ipad os 16. this phone info is coming up 
n2vHm0y1Fik,298800,302800,and they are actually making preparations for it as we see so here it 
n2vHm0y1Fik,302800,307759,is the new hardware the new leaked information for majin buu and according 
n2vHm0y1Fik,307760,313440,to his sources they are seeing from mac os 13 that there should be a version of 
n2vHm0y1Fik,313440,318720,time machine the backup system for your max that's completely redone it's going 
n2vHm0y1Fik,318720,323120,to be integrated with icloud drive and in addition apple is expecting to 
n2vHm0y1Fik,323120,327919,introduce new airports in november why would apple want to do that why would 
n2vHm0y1Fik,327920,332880,they discontinue their airports four years ago and then now all of a sudden 
n2vHm0y1Fik,332880,337600,they're gonna be bringing it back well when we take a look back at the airports 
n2vHm0y1Fik,337600,342560,they were launching them when we had major changes in technology the first 
n2vHm0y1Fik,342560,346160,flying saucer model brought this technology to the masses and then the 
n2vHm0y1Fik,346160,351520,airport extreme is what allowed for ultra fast speeds and for broadband to 
n2vHm0y1Fik,351520,356720,be able to use instead of slow dial up on top of that they made it so easy to 
n2vHm0y1Fik,356720,361680,set up and to use instead of having to use a web login browser that's a lot of 
n2vHm0y1Fik,361680,365840,them still need now and then four to five years later we had another 
n2vHm0y1Fik,366480,371760,breakthrough product called time capsule this took your airport extreme and your 
n2vHm0y1Fik,371760,376480,hard drive that you would use for backup and fuse them together this gave people 
n2vHm0y1Fik,376480,382720,a super easy and reliable solution that was automated and worked on multiple 
n2vHm0y1Fik,382720,387200,macs in your house without having to do anything it was incredible and then 
n2vHm0y1Fik,387200,393040,another four years later apple brought out the latest airport extreme design 
n2vHm0y1Fik,393040,399360,with the trashcan mac pro that came out right as we got the ac standard that had 
n2vHm0y1Fik,399360,406319,multiple streams dual band boarding antennas super great range and it also 
n2vHm0y1Fik,406320,411520,could include a hard drive for that time capsule backup so this design was their 
n2vHm0y1Fik,411520,416080,very last one that they didn't update for a while and then they ended up 
n2vHm0y1Fik,416080,421680,canceling now believe it or not people are still spending a lot of money on 
n2vHm0y1Fik,421680,426720,this older outdated deck because it's easy to use it's reliable and you have 
n2vHm0y1Fik,426720,431520,those backups so why did apple not really change anything well not much 
n2vHm0y1Fik,431520,436560,happened in many years after that the wireless stayed the same the speeds many 
n2vHm0y1Fik,436560,441919,routers are still using those today and third-party options got so cheap that 
n2vHm0y1Fik,441920,446960,these were just kind of too expensive for a lot of people and in fact even the 
n2vHm0y1Fik,446960,453759,2019 mac pro and all of the macs other than the new m1s only support internet 
n2vHm0y1Fik,453760,459200,speeds as fast as this airport extreme they don't support wi-fi six now 
n2vHm0y1Fik,459200,463920,recently wi-fi six started to come out the new macbooks finally support it but 
n2vHm0y1Fik,463920,469680,they're still a little bit back dated on the bluetooth and we now have wi-fi 6e 
n2vHm0y1Fik,470240,475599,that was released and people start to spend way more money on their routers 
n2vHm0y1Fik,475600,479760,some of these wi-fi 60 routers are incredibly expensive and people are 
n2vHm0y1Fik,479760,484000,buying them hard drives have also gotten much cheaper since apple came out with a 
n2vHm0y1Fik,484000,490160,time capsule and were charging a ton of money for this new technology and with 
n2vHm0y1Fik,490160,493920,that not only has it been four years since apple discontinued the airport 
n2vHm0y1Fik,493920,499280,line but they are also going to be coming out with a new mac pro that they 
n2vHm0y1Fik,499280,506639,talked about which is right in time for new technology wi-fi 6e and an airport 
n2vHm0y1Fik,506640,511040,extreme or whatever they want to call it that also enables that technology bring 
n2vHm0y1Fik,511040,515599,me to these new macs if apple is going to put out a new wi-fi router just like 
n2vHm0y1Fik,515599,519919,we've seen before every time they released a new one it was the very 
n2vHm0y1Fik,519919,525120,newest latest and greatest wi-fi technology going back all the way to the 
n2vHm0y1Fik,525120,530320,very first one this is going to be prime time to switch to this new generation 
n2vHm0y1Fik,530320,535760,upgrade all their connectivity and gives users you know what they want now along 
n2vHm0y1Fik,535760,540960,with that leak we also have the info about icloud drive you've been able to 
n2vHm0y1Fik,540960,546160,back up your ipads your iphones your apple watch all to icloud drive but on 
n2vHm0y1Fik,546160,550959,the mac side it has only been certain files that if they're deleted online or 
n2vHm0y1Fik,550960,556000,on your mac they get removed you know vice versa so if you have been using 
n2vHm0y1Fik,556000,559200,that it doesn't work great you still have to use time machine and because of 
n2vHm0y1Fik,559200,564160,that people are still buying these very expensive overpriced old time capsule 
n2vHm0y1Fik,564160,568720,airport extremes to have automatic backups that are off of their laptop 
n2vHm0y1Fik,568720,572800,without having to plug in a cable i'm really shocked that apple has not 
n2vHm0y1Fik,572800,577279,implemented this yet with icloud drive now if they're going to be doing this 
n2vHm0y1Fik,577280,580160,maybe they won't put a hard drive in the actual airport extreme maybe they're 
n2vHm0y1Fik,580160,584720,going to wrap it up in their bundles and with that they might also enable 
n2vHm0y1Fik,584720,587839,higher capacities we've been capped at two terabytes for a while some people 
n2vHm0y1Fik,587840,592960,even have two plans so maybe they'll go up to five and give a larger amount for 
n2vHm0y1Fik,592960,597040,people to use especially with family plans which is the way that i use it now 
n2vHm0y1Fik,597040,600800,with that a lot of people and publications have been talking about how 
n2vHm0y1Fik,600800,606720,this is the missing piece from apple's lineup people are saying they should 
n2vHm0y1Fik,606720,612319,bring it back it makes sense especially now with these brand new m1 and upcoming 
n2vHm0y1Fik,612320,617760,m2 powered macs so apple it seems like is going to give people what they want 
n2vHm0y1Fik,617760,621040,now you guys let me know down below is this something that you're interested in 
n2vHm0y1Fik,621040,625680,will you buy something from apple that can be integrated in the whole ecosystem 
n2vHm0y1Fik,625680,629440,or do you already have another solution that works really well for you i want to
