InjJ7WIpsZE,4000,11759,sometimes success is merely hanging on  when others would let go
InjJ7WIpsZE,11759,17840,not doing anything spectacular  or out of the ordinary
InjJ7WIpsZE,17840,24480,not leaping a mile or jumping over a  mountain  but simply
InjJ7WIpsZE,24480,31760,carrying on  thomas edison has a famous quote that's
InjJ7WIpsZE,31760,37200,really stuck with me over the years he  says many of life's failures
InjJ7WIpsZE,37200,44879,are people who did not realize how close  they were to success when they gave up
InjJ7WIpsZE,44879,50320,right how close they were to the finish  line when they turned their back
InjJ7WIpsZE,50320,56640,and said it wasn't worth it  it's really an interesting thing to
InjJ7WIpsZE,56640,63359,grasp  right success is seeing  what others can't
InjJ7WIpsZE,63359,68960,it's believing when others don't it's  taking the abstract
InjJ7WIpsZE,68960,77040,those visions those pictures in your  head to make believe  and finding the courage to make them
InjJ7WIpsZE,77040,81040,real  bring them to life
InjJ7WIpsZE,82320,87600,it's this constantly evolving process  and it grows a little bit every single  day
InjJ7WIpsZE,87600,93680,sometimes we feel that progress we feel  the momentum we do something big and  it's exciting
InjJ7WIpsZE,93680,100159,and sometimes the progress feels small  and there are times when we get knocked
InjJ7WIpsZE,100159,105360,down and we don't see it at all  we feel like
InjJ7WIpsZE,105360,114079,because we weren't validated that we  lost  [Music]  that we failed that it wasn't enough
InjJ7WIpsZE,114079,119600,we forget that's part of the process  that progress is a journey
InjJ7WIpsZE,119600,125490,and it goes when you go  and it stops when you stop
InjJ7WIpsZE,125490,133599,[Music]  just like that famous dalai lama quote  right the only way to fail is to quit
InjJ7WIpsZE,133599,140400,period  no one ever stops because they can't
InjJ7WIpsZE,141120,147120,they stop because they decide to  they stop because they see that huge  mountain and they think that's
InjJ7WIpsZE,147120,151920,impossible they forget it's only made of  little rocks
InjJ7WIpsZE,152239,158879,they stop because they get so  disheartened by the distance of the  finish line that they forget it only
InjJ7WIpsZE,158879,164640,takes a collection of little steps to  get there  you don't have to leap the entire
InjJ7WIpsZE,164640,170480,distance  you know i've been there  it's this is me speaking from experience
InjJ7WIpsZE,170480,176640,it took me years to figure it out  and even now life is rapidly evolving
InjJ7WIpsZE,176640,183680,i've poured my heart into things that  let's be honest no one cared about  i've invested in opportunities that fell
InjJ7WIpsZE,183680,189440,apart right in front of me  and each time it felt like the end of  the world
InjJ7WIpsZE,189440,196640,i've been lost i've been unsure  gotten up after things didn't go as  planned and it felt like a loser had to
InjJ7WIpsZE,196640,203280,look myself in the mirror and pick  myself back up off the floor but there's  one thing
InjJ7WIpsZE,203280,210799,that i kept doing that i never thought  twice about  and that's continuing on whether life
InjJ7WIpsZE,210799,216959,lifted me up or it beat me down my plan  for tomorrow was always the same
InjJ7WIpsZE,216959,222640,get up and try again keep  going
InjJ7WIpsZE,222640,228720,and as i sat down this morning with my  pen and a piece of paper i thought  what's the one thing i would want to be
InjJ7WIpsZE,228720,235200,told if i started out again what's the  one thing that people  need to hear most
InjJ7WIpsZE,235200,240840,and it's to simply keep  going
InjJ7WIpsZE,240879,246640,keep  taking steps  because one day the world will start to
InjJ7WIpsZE,246640,253439,make sense  and you'll look around and you will be  thankful for one thing
InjJ7WIpsZE,253439,261919,that when most would have stopped  you didn't  when the world said no you said yes
InjJ7WIpsZE,261919,269120,there is nothing so powerful  as a soul that refuses to back down
InjJ7WIpsZE,269120,274320,see persistence is not an important  thing or an essential thing
InjJ7WIpsZE,274320,281759,it's everything  so live as to see
InjJ7WIpsZE,281759,288720,not what can be lost but what will be  gained  find that light in darkness even if it's
InjJ7WIpsZE,288720,296160,a flicker even if it's a spark  see every loss makes you a little
InjJ7WIpsZE,296160,302400,tougher and every instant of sadness  uncovers something beautiful every
InjJ7WIpsZE,302400,308240,moment of fear teaches you to be a  little braver every broken heart opens
InjJ7WIpsZE,308240,314960,the door to a new connection  instead of doubting yourself feeling
InjJ7WIpsZE,314960,320880,inadequate in life's darkest moments  know that you need what you are going  through
InjJ7WIpsZE,320880,326800,you are uncovering the little victories  hidden in plain  view
InjJ7WIpsZE,326800,333199,so when the world feels like too much  and your patience is thin be stronger
InjJ7WIpsZE,333199,341039,than that voice in your head begging you  to think  small stand on every experience the good
InjJ7WIpsZE,341039,348840,and the bad let it elevate you  to a beautiful tomorrow
InjJ7WIpsZE,363480,369440,[Music]  if there's time
InjJ7WIpsZE,369440,373680,then there's time to turn things around
InjJ7WIpsZE,374560,381400,if there is a tomorrow  then there is hope  today
InjJ7WIpsZE,381600,390000,the only have to bes in life  are the ones we prop up and adhere to
InjJ7WIpsZE,390000,395199,and how interesting that oftentimes we  don't even realize we're the ones
InjJ7WIpsZE,395199,398560,holding them up
InjJ7WIpsZE,400560,408720,there's a simple question  that i like to ask as the sun comes up  and the coffee brews
InjJ7WIpsZE,408720,416160,am i living today  like it's an obligation  or something more
InjJ7WIpsZE,416160,423199,is it an automatic continuation of the  past  or a methodical move towards a future
InjJ7WIpsZE,423199,428960,that lights me up  and these aren't small distinctions
InjJ7WIpsZE,428960,434080,right i've lived both ways i've felt  what it's like to feel both
InjJ7WIpsZE,434080,440319,i remember going to work and joking  around that a flat tire would be a real  treat
InjJ7WIpsZE,440319,447440,that's not accountability  that's not control  that's essentially living life as a
InjJ7WIpsZE,447440,452240,jellyfish floating along with the tide
InjJ7WIpsZE,452560,457599,and while the lack of required output  innovation and planning may have felt
InjJ7WIpsZE,457599,464960,like a win in the moment  or a burden lifted off my shoulders at  the time
InjJ7WIpsZE,464960,472479,deprived me of that which resides in the  soul of every human being alive
InjJ7WIpsZE,472479,478560,purpose  personal agency see you can only go so  far
InjJ7WIpsZE,478560,485599,so long being the spectator of your own  journey  you can only go so long looking out the
InjJ7WIpsZE,485599,490800,window before you wonder  just what it'd be like to be behind the
InjJ7WIpsZE,490800,496160,wheel  when we put our actions up against the
InjJ7WIpsZE,496160,501759,question  why  it astounds me how many things are done
InjJ7WIpsZE,501759,508319,because it's what we've always done  we act like we're expected to act
InjJ7WIpsZE,508319,514959,think  like we're expected to think see who  we're expected to see
InjJ7WIpsZE,514959,520120,but expected  by whom
InjJ7WIpsZE,521200,527040,some of my greatest breakthroughs in  life  emerged after being asked why
InjJ7WIpsZE,527040,534480,by people i look up to or respect  why have you accepted that
InjJ7WIpsZE,534480,540880,that's your income okay great but why  that's how you spend your day
InjJ7WIpsZE,540880,546399,i see  how calm  and when one is tasked with looking at
InjJ7WIpsZE,546399,553440,their own life through a magnifying  glass some hidden truths always emerge
InjJ7WIpsZE,553440,559440,it shines a spotlight in the corner of  the room illuminating those shadows  where one can
InjJ7WIpsZE,559440,565200,if they look hard enough  make out the wolf in sheep's clothing
InjJ7WIpsZE,565200,571839,that is the phrase  because that's how i've always done it
InjJ7WIpsZE,571839,576959,we get in life what we accept  we are what we allow ourselves to be and
InjJ7WIpsZE,576959,584880,if we don't ask ourselves which mountain  is worth climbing  which ocean is worth crossing
InjJ7WIpsZE,584880,591760,we simply float with the tide  we're at the mercy of the winds
InjJ7WIpsZE,591760,599040,we forfeit the mastery over our own  lives that awaits  if we're willing to take that wheel and
InjJ7WIpsZE,599040,604560,navigate  [Music]  so here are a few things to take with
InjJ7WIpsZE,604560,610480,you  first is you are bound by nothing
InjJ7WIpsZE,610480,618160,the parameters you exist between are of  your making  you can get in that car and drive you
InjJ7WIpsZE,618160,624320,can walk away and begin something new  you can entertain that vision that's
InjJ7WIpsZE,624320,629680,been conveniently tucked away in the  back of your mind
InjJ7WIpsZE,629680,636320,understand that to not go is fine  but it's a decision
InjJ7WIpsZE,636480,641680,and perhaps a decision you'll wish you  made differently
InjJ7WIpsZE,641680,647360,and second  difficult today liberates you tomorrow
InjJ7WIpsZE,647360,652800,it's easier to observe  it's easier to say how you wish things
InjJ7WIpsZE,652800,658959,were  after all stepping out into the  fast-paced chaotic world is tough
InjJ7WIpsZE,658959,664160,it's scary it's unpredictable but it's  where you find yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,664160,670480,and the path that's calling your name  it's beyond the pins and needles
InjJ7WIpsZE,670480,675519,emerging as one jumps into the cold  water that they're able to find that
InjJ7WIpsZE,675519,681040,evolution  if there's time then there's time to  turn things around if there is a
InjJ7WIpsZE,681040,688040,tomorrow  then there is hope  today
InjJ7WIpsZE,695120,702000,what's the difference between simple and  easy  well simple is straightforward
InjJ7WIpsZE,702000,707600,uncomplicated  easy on the other hand means achieved
InjJ7WIpsZE,707600,713040,without great  effort  the difference between those two words
InjJ7WIpsZE,713040,721440,is subtle  but essential to understand one deals  with the complexity of an outcome
InjJ7WIpsZE,721440,728879,the other  your will and determination to achieve  that outcome
InjJ7WIpsZE,729279,735760,becoming who you most want to be is  simple  but becoming who you most want to be is
InjJ7WIpsZE,735760,741200,not easy  just like walking is simple yet hiking
InjJ7WIpsZE,741200,746880,up a mountain is not easy the procedure  didn't change the context did
InjJ7WIpsZE,746880,753680,so let's talk about context  let's talk about this cyclical nature of  growth because it's not that most people
InjJ7WIpsZE,753680,762079,can't  it's that most people won't  it's not that most people don't get how
InjJ7WIpsZE,762079,769519,it's that they don't have a strong  enough why  the path is laid out before you
InjJ7WIpsZE,769519,776639,you just have to be willing to walk down  it  will you
InjJ7WIpsZE,777680,783200,step one  realize there's more out there
InjJ7WIpsZE,783200,789200,it's not that what you're doing now  isn't amazing  it's just that yesterday's act of
InjJ7WIpsZE,789200,796320,courage is now today's status quo  what was the spectacular is now the
InjJ7WIpsZE,796320,802079,mundane  what was once the ceiling you had to  jump to touch is now the floor you walk
InjJ7WIpsZE,802079,808959,on so at the very least  it prompts you to ask well what's next
InjJ7WIpsZE,809760,814800,simple  not easy
InjJ7WIpsZE,814800,821760,step two the acquisition of courage  yesterday's courage was a fight
InjJ7WIpsZE,821760,828399,it took a lot out of you and it's  ultimately what got you here  but it dropped you at the curb it waved
InjJ7WIpsZE,828399,835199,goodbye and went on its merry way and  here you are  you can stay here
InjJ7WIpsZE,835199,842000,a lot of people do you can reminisce of  the glory days the old path yesterday's  triumphs
InjJ7WIpsZE,842000,849519,or  you can do that perpetually  uncomfortable exercise of vulnerability
InjJ7WIpsZE,849519,855440,stepping into tomorrow's unknown  reminding yourself that life's greatest  rewards have a hefty price tag and that
InjJ7WIpsZE,855440,861360,price is discomfort  but i've already played this game one
InjJ7WIpsZE,861360,868160,might think  no what you did was learn the rules  now it's time to apply them to a new
InjJ7WIpsZE,868160,873600,setting and around goes the  merry-go-round it might seem like a  replication
InjJ7WIpsZE,873600,879519,from the horizontal but here's the  secret you can't see the vertical you  have yet to look down and see your
InjJ7WIpsZE,879519,884800,ascent see what you're becoming  just by staying on
InjJ7WIpsZE,884800,890720,holding tight just by believing in  yourself enough to begin again
InjJ7WIpsZE,890720,896399,you are fanning those tiny flames of  courage in your soul
InjJ7WIpsZE,896399,902320,that wait to be spread like a wildfire  simple
InjJ7WIpsZE,902320,908959,but not easy  step three  mistakes
InjJ7WIpsZE,908959,914160,now of course it's not the mistakes  themselves you fear
InjJ7WIpsZE,914320,919360,it's what  you think those mistakes will mean
InjJ7WIpsZE,919360,926320,ridicule embarrassment lack of direction  or identity losing what you have but  here's the catch
InjJ7WIpsZE,926320,931920,when you realize the upside is greater  than the downside you liberate yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,931920,940639,when you realize there's more to gain  than to lose  your potential for greatness is born
InjJ7WIpsZE,940639,946320,how does one act on this mistakes by  making mistakes by injecting yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,946320,952079,into the turbulence of progress  our biology has not yet learned that the
InjJ7WIpsZE,952079,959199,uncomfortable thing is the right thing  and that's why you get resistance that's  why it hurts
InjJ7WIpsZE,960079,964639,and it's why few people will accomplish  what you will
InjJ7WIpsZE,966000,972800,when it comes to your climb every day  is opposite day  when they run out you're running in
InjJ7WIpsZE,972800,979839,when they play safe  you play for the victory to become who  you might be you must learn how to get
InjJ7WIpsZE,979839,986079,there mistakes are your  curriculum  simple
InjJ7WIpsZE,986079,992079,but not easy  step four trust yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,992079,997600,okay sure no problem easy well yeah it's  easy when you're getting what you want
InjJ7WIpsZE,997600,1004880,but evolution takes time and there's  nothing quite like giving and giving and  giving and not getting
InjJ7WIpsZE,1004959,1012800,there's nothing quite like stepping up  to the plate again and again and again  and bringing no runners home
InjJ7WIpsZE,1013600,1019360,so how does one find the strength to  continue walking up to the batter's box
InjJ7WIpsZE,1019759,1025199,well growth is exponential and those  swings and misses matter the infield  singles matter
InjJ7WIpsZE,1025199,1030558,everything matters  because it's all chiseling your future
InjJ7WIpsZE,1030558,1039360,self out of stone nothing is dependent  on the next at bat  as much as all at bats in the aggregate
InjJ7WIpsZE,1039360,1044400,that's why success is so often  considered to be sheer will dependent  not on the home run but on the
InjJ7WIpsZE,1044400,1050480,discipline the self-belief to keep  walking up to the plate  repetition
InjJ7WIpsZE,1050480,1055919,and adjustment repetition and adjustment  repeat and refine repeat refine those
InjJ7WIpsZE,1055919,1061120,are the materials from which all things  are made simple
InjJ7WIpsZE,1061120,1066559,but not easy  and then we have the finale the ending
InjJ7WIpsZE,1066559,1072000,step  five  celebrate and adjust
InjJ7WIpsZE,1072000,1078880,at some point you'll be able to look  over your shoulder and notice something  that perhaps you hadn't before space
InjJ7WIpsZE,1078880,1084400,space between where you are and where  you started it's not sudden but gradual
InjJ7WIpsZE,1084400,1090480,and undoubtedly with enough persistence  it will emerge  these moments they are precious they are
InjJ7WIpsZE,1090480,1095760,times to acknowledge what you've  accomplished the sacrifices you have  made
InjJ7WIpsZE,1095760,1103120,they are life's way of reminding you  what you are building and who you are  becoming it's a time of celebration
InjJ7WIpsZE,1103120,1110400,every little win means something every  small victory matters so relish in it
InjJ7WIpsZE,1110400,1116960,and then  transform it  normalize it recognize that
InjJ7WIpsZE,1116960,1124160,that mountaintop  is your foundation now your starting  point has changed and so have you which
InjJ7WIpsZE,1124160,1129600,means so have your expectations with an  increase in ability comes an upgrade to
InjJ7WIpsZE,1129600,1136480,what's possible what's expected and look  at that  we have arrived at a new step one
InjJ7WIpsZE,1136480,1142160,realize there is more  this is the process
InjJ7WIpsZE,1142160,1148320,for capturing that which life has to  offer if you can fall in love with that
InjJ7WIpsZE,1148320,1153600,appreciate it respect it  while simultaneously understanding it's
InjJ7WIpsZE,1153600,1159360,not scary it's dependent entirely on  your ability to push forward  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,1159360,1165200,if you can understand that there is  nothing you can't do  nowhere you can't go
InjJ7WIpsZE,1165200,1170559,simple yes easy no  but you're not in this for easy you're
InjJ7WIpsZE,1170559,1177360,in it for the journey the growth the  adventure you're in it because it's not  easy
InjJ7WIpsZE,1177360,1185840,you'll see in time as will the world  that this decision to endure was simply
InjJ7WIpsZE,1185840,1190279,the best one you ever made
InjJ7WIpsZE,1191020,1196170,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,1209600,1215679,the other day i woke up with a plan  three things i had to do
InjJ7WIpsZE,1215679,1222240,so i wrote them on my whiteboard they  were essentially my objectives for the  day
InjJ7WIpsZE,1222480,1227679,but it ended up being one of those days  where things didn't unfold the way i  anticipated
InjJ7WIpsZE,1227679,1232720,and for a variety of reasons  curveball after a curveball with some
InjJ7WIpsZE,1232720,1239200,sloppy decision making sprinkled in  there  eventually morning became afternoon
InjJ7WIpsZE,1239200,1246880,afternoon became evening  i found myself exhausted  and looking up at a white board
InjJ7WIpsZE,1246880,1251919,that was showing me i had accomplished  none of the things listed
InjJ7WIpsZE,1251919,1257760,and i hate that feeling  having clear objectives and not meeting
InjJ7WIpsZE,1257760,1263840,them  right and so after dinner i got a phone  call  and i found myself talking about how i
InjJ7WIpsZE,1263840,1270559,fell short getting it all off my chest  letting it all out there  and i got that reassurance that i wanted
InjJ7WIpsZE,1270559,1275760,without even realizing that i wanted it  right  the voice said back to me eddie this
InjJ7WIpsZE,1275760,1282000,happens it's not a big deal in the grand  scheme of things no one's perfect you  put a lot of pressure on yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,1282000,1288840,tomorrow's a new day right that type of  thing and it's like  okay exhale time for
InjJ7WIpsZE,1288840,1294640,bed the next morning  i was outside relaxing doing some  thinking
InjJ7WIpsZE,1294640,1301120,and came to this point and you'll see  how these dots connect here in a second  um but essentially
InjJ7WIpsZE,1301120,1309120,i see life  as a staircase right where we thrust  ourselves out  uh into discomfort into chaos
InjJ7WIpsZE,1309120,1316240,and then amidst the storm  we're forced to grow  we step into shoes we were once unable
InjJ7WIpsZE,1316240,1323440,to fill  and what was once bigger than us is now  normal it's every day it's ordinary
InjJ7WIpsZE,1323440,1329919,because we fought for it  we pushed ourselves through that's  evolution
InjJ7WIpsZE,1329919,1336000,but  now  guess what  that old ceiling has become the floor
InjJ7WIpsZE,1336000,1342320,it's time to evolve  it's time for that next step  in this staircase time to thrust
InjJ7WIpsZE,1342320,1349600,ourselves back into the chaos of life so  that we can again  tame something bigger than us
InjJ7WIpsZE,1349600,1355200,take the next intimidating thing and  make it commonplace
InjJ7WIpsZE,1355200,1362480,and as i sat there outside thinking  i found myself to be at that next step
InjJ7WIpsZE,1362480,1367840,ready to leap out again into the  tumultuous winds of life
InjJ7WIpsZE,1367840,1374080,but this time it felt different  there's an intersection and i talk about
InjJ7WIpsZE,1374080,1380880,it often uh of doing what adds value to  the world  and doing what makes you content
InjJ7WIpsZE,1380880,1388400,personally  okay i think where those two things uh  meet  is peak living that's where the magic
InjJ7WIpsZE,1388400,1395520,happens  and i'm fortunate enough that these  thoughts speeches episodes videos
InjJ7WIpsZE,1395520,1402000,whatever you want to call them  on some days  literally reach over 200 000 people and
InjJ7WIpsZE,1402000,1409919,that's not meant to be a a humble brag  or anything like that it's  just to me so incredible that i can't
InjJ7WIpsZE,1409919,1417679,process it right i get emotional  thinking about it  my dream is to add value to other people
InjJ7WIpsZE,1417679,1424960,provide that little lift  that might help someone look at their  own problems differently maybe see a
InjJ7WIpsZE,1424960,1431679,path when before they were unable to  that's what it's all about
InjJ7WIpsZE,1431679,1437200,and then in addition to that a parallel  track on a personal level
InjJ7WIpsZE,1437200,1442559,feeling like i'm growing and evolving as  well constantly stepping up those stairs
InjJ7WIpsZE,1442559,1447600,one by one having the courage to  continue fighting those unknowns and
InjJ7WIpsZE,1447600,1453039,making sense of life's complexities  that's why so many of you are on this
InjJ7WIpsZE,1453039,1458080,journey with me and so as i looked up at  that next step
InjJ7WIpsZE,1458080,1464480,and it felt bigger  than it ever had before  i knew the task
InjJ7WIpsZE,1464480,1470880,needed to be bigger than it's ever been  which would require of me one of the  biggest changes i've ever made and that
InjJ7WIpsZE,1470880,1477360,scared me to death  knowing that in order for something to  be born something must die something
InjJ7WIpsZE,1477360,1483200,must be left behind  i've been stepping forward for years and
InjJ7WIpsZE,1483200,1488270,thank god for that but now  it was time  for a leap
InjJ7WIpsZE,1488270,1494400,[Music]  and so back to that white board i  mentioned earlier if you hang in with me
InjJ7WIpsZE,1494400,1503279,long enough i usually come full circle  right back to the list of goals i missed  the bad day why am i so fixated on that
InjJ7WIpsZE,1503279,1509600,well it has nothing to do with the day  itself everyone swings and misses from  time to time
InjJ7WIpsZE,1509600,1515039,it has nothing to do with those three  goals everyone falls short here and  there
InjJ7WIpsZE,1515039,1521440,that's part of life  it's about the person i want to be
InjJ7WIpsZE,1521440,1527760,as i endure those turbulent times  it's about the strength to handle my own
InjJ7WIpsZE,1527760,1536480,chaos and battles differently  before you can lead others
InjJ7WIpsZE,1536480,1542880,you need to lead yourself  and that means being vulnerable  it means being honest
InjJ7WIpsZE,1542880,1550799,it means looking in the mirror and  asking yourself the tough questions it  means being stronger
InjJ7WIpsZE,1550799,1558159,than i've ever been  there will be times that require of me
InjJ7WIpsZE,1558159,1563200,that i push forward without having to  hear from my parents or girlfriend or
InjJ7WIpsZE,1563200,1569039,buddies that everything's all right  the next step requires that i trust
InjJ7WIpsZE,1569039,1574240,myself to be the guy  in my own life
InjJ7WIpsZE,1574559,1580240,to have impact in the world  one must find strength within themselves
InjJ7WIpsZE,1580240,1585760,where they didn't know it existed this  is a leveling up
InjJ7WIpsZE,1585760,1591679,that i know is required  for me to be more than i've ever been  stronger bolder more confident when i'm
InjJ7WIpsZE,1591679,1596960,most fearful  there was a line i used to draw
InjJ7WIpsZE,1596960,1604880,separating me in the people  i look up to  and the moment for me
InjJ7WIpsZE,1605039,1611120,was a message  i knew it was time for me to mentally  remove that line you'll never be more
InjJ7WIpsZE,1611120,1617440,than you envision yourself to be  it was time to be my own answer
InjJ7WIpsZE,1617440,1624960,promote myself to that next level from  the kid with the dream to the man that  makes it happen it's time it's just
InjJ7WIpsZE,1624960,1632480,simply time  even the ones i love the ones closest to  me they can't provide that
InjJ7WIpsZE,1632480,1639840,has to be internally derived from a  place so deep that come hell or high  water it's happening
InjJ7WIpsZE,1639840,1646559,and telling people about my little  misfortunes so that they can pat me on  the head and tell me things are great
InjJ7WIpsZE,1646559,1653440,that's antithetical to what is required  of me next  there is a level of courage and strength
InjJ7WIpsZE,1653440,1659760,and excellence in all of us that lives  at the bottom of this abyss that we must  pull
InjJ7WIpsZE,1659760,1665200,up  with everything we have
InjJ7WIpsZE,1665200,1670559,until it becomes intertwined with who we  are and where we're headed and as i sat
InjJ7WIpsZE,1670559,1678080,there i knew it to be true  i couldn't help
InjJ7WIpsZE,1678080,1684720,but feel that change was about to happen  and it would stem directly from how i  see myself it would be the product of
InjJ7WIpsZE,1684720,1690000,who i knew myself to be and so now most  importantly
InjJ7WIpsZE,1690000,1697679,i present this question to you  are you at that next step
InjJ7WIpsZE,1697679,1704559,are you looking at a chasm that must be  crossed  where all your little decisions all the
InjJ7WIpsZE,1704559,1712320,courage and discipline and strength that  you utilize to get here  that has positioned you for this moment
InjJ7WIpsZE,1712320,1718000,is it telling you something is next  is the time to dig deeper and be more
InjJ7WIpsZE,1718000,1724559,than you have ever in your life been  in my example by the way was not about
InjJ7WIpsZE,1724559,1730159,holding in our problems or dismissing  those around us  asking for help and we need help is
InjJ7WIpsZE,1730159,1735600,courage  the small circle we surround ourselves  with is a direct reflection of who we
InjJ7WIpsZE,1735600,1742320,are no for me it was about being the  type of person who trusts myself to  weather those storms
InjJ7WIpsZE,1742320,1747600,about moving with greater conviction  graduating from going to be
InjJ7WIpsZE,1747600,1754399,to is currently that white board that  phone call was the turning point and
InjJ7WIpsZE,1754399,1761200,nothing more  and my example may fit your life like a  glove you may think wow that's exactly
InjJ7WIpsZE,1761200,1767200,the lens i need right now  but maybe it's not  maybe your situation is a little
InjJ7WIpsZE,1767200,1773520,different  maybe the road you're on  is newer less traveled maybe it's the
InjJ7WIpsZE,1773520,1779520,courage to take that first step  to play this student
InjJ7WIpsZE,1779520,1787440,perfect  because whatever it is  as you look up at that next step
InjJ7WIpsZE,1787440,1796640,what matters is that you know  in your heart and soul that you have  what it takes to become that person
InjJ7WIpsZE,1796640,1804960,it's not bigger than you it is you  someone once told me that the world will
InjJ7WIpsZE,1804960,1810640,not believe it until you do  so believe
InjJ7WIpsZE,1810640,1817120,believe it like your dreams depend on it  because as it turns out they do
InjJ7WIpsZE,1817120,1822720,as it turns out everything about your  future is make believe until you breathe
InjJ7WIpsZE,1822720,1829840,life into it  look around you at your current reality
InjJ7WIpsZE,1829840,1834880,remember that it is a product of what  you've allowed and that at any time you
InjJ7WIpsZE,1834880,1840799,can up the ante  climb the step reach a new level
InjJ7WIpsZE,1840799,1846720,you have it within yourself to do that  just give yourself permission to be that
InjJ7WIpsZE,1846720,1852880,person  and it will be scary  it's going to hurt at times
InjJ7WIpsZE,1852880,1857919,but let's be that vulnerable  let's show the world what we can create
InjJ7WIpsZE,1857919,1864159,when we move into it as though it's ours  as though destiny isn't assigned but
InjJ7WIpsZE,1864159,1869200,written  one  beautiful act of courage
InjJ7WIpsZE,1869200,1872600,at a time
InjJ7WIpsZE,1888480,1895440,can life change in a day  well what if we made today
InjJ7WIpsZE,1895440,1900720,a day of action  of being decisive of promising ourselves
InjJ7WIpsZE,1900720,1906399,that our goal or objective  is to make a single
InjJ7WIpsZE,1906399,1912559,move  however small  what if today
InjJ7WIpsZE,1912559,1918559,action is king  and we live by the notion that
InjJ7WIpsZE,1918559,1925360,whether the result of our courage is  good or bad  whether it's the result we hoped for the
InjJ7WIpsZE,1925360,1930480,one that we didn't  at least  now
InjJ7WIpsZE,1930480,1935919,we have something to work off of  and that means we've moved beyond where
InjJ7WIpsZE,1935919,1942480,we started  what if today we live by the notion that
InjJ7WIpsZE,1942480,1950080,a vision can change our lives  but a vision without that small step
InjJ7WIpsZE,1950080,1955679,is powerless  and today we take that small
InjJ7WIpsZE,1955679,1961679,step  it's easy to forget how good progress
InjJ7WIpsZE,1961679,1967279,feels  how incredible it is to know that we're  moving towards something meaningful in
InjJ7WIpsZE,1967279,1973120,our lives  [Music]  something that we chose that we're  building
InjJ7WIpsZE,1973120,1978640,we had the courage to break life down so  that piece by piece we could build it
InjJ7WIpsZE,1978640,1985600,back up  we are our happiest when we are  progressing
InjJ7WIpsZE,1985600,1992640,we're designed  to map out the unknown unexplored  territory to make it
InjJ7WIpsZE,1992640,2000399,our own  we're not just flesh and bone but  travelers with godlike capability
InjJ7WIpsZE,2000399,2007200,of seeing that which is not yet  there  and with an idea and courage
InjJ7WIpsZE,2007200,2014559,there's nothing we can't do  and that's why when we stop seeing  infinite opportunity when we pretend
InjJ7WIpsZE,2014559,2020320,that settling is okay the status quo is  enough we know  deep
InjJ7WIpsZE,2020320,2026559,down in our souls that something's  missing we need the next door
InjJ7WIpsZE,2026559,2033360,to unlock  so today let's find just one door that
InjJ7WIpsZE,2033360,2040080,we can open  it remind yourself of the shock wave  that goes through your system when
InjJ7WIpsZE,2040080,2048240,inspiration  guides an idea and progress turns that  idea into reality because momentum
InjJ7WIpsZE,2048240,2053200,connects every aspect of life
InjJ7WIpsZE,2053520,2058720,not hitting the snooze button  can mean seeing the sun rise
InjJ7WIpsZE,2058720,2066398,which can mean you read three pages in a  book you wouldn't have read which could  mean your day improves which could mean
InjJ7WIpsZE,2066398,2072720,you make a call that you've been meaning  to make which could mean a dozen wheels  start turning not because you did
InjJ7WIpsZE,2072720,2078000,everything but because you did one  thing
InjJ7WIpsZE,2079280,2087118,today can be the day that changes your  life  and you don't even need the miraculous
InjJ7WIpsZE,2087118,2093599,to make that happen you just need to  push back  against the normalcy of your everyday
InjJ7WIpsZE,2093599,2100880,create little microcosms of chaos  that you can tame you can understand
InjJ7WIpsZE,2100880,2106079,make your own and then stack  on top of each other
InjJ7WIpsZE,2106079,2111200,today you treat that little voice of  uneasiness or nervousness in your
InjJ7WIpsZE,2111200,2116880,stomach as assurance  that the path before you is the right
InjJ7WIpsZE,2116880,2123280,one  remember that almost all decisions are  reversible
InjJ7WIpsZE,2123280,2130640,but that a decision  at least puts you somewhere right or  wrong it moves you along and shows you
InjJ7WIpsZE,2130640,2137359,more of life the things the people the  places you've never seen before
InjJ7WIpsZE,2137359,2144480,and the only bad decision  is no decision  some folks never moved towards meeting
InjJ7WIpsZE,2144480,2150480,towards the things that they want in  well their entire lifetime
InjJ7WIpsZE,2150480,2156880,because they didn't realize it wasn't an  earthquake they needed to shake the old  world at its foundation
InjJ7WIpsZE,2156880,2164800,they needed to make  one decision  one decision that might be wrong
InjJ7WIpsZE,2164960,2171200,but at the very least would reassure  them that wrong decisions aren't fatal
InjJ7WIpsZE,2171440,2178000,a decision  allows you to remap  a new reality and take another step and
InjJ7WIpsZE,2178000,2183119,another and another you can change your  life today
InjJ7WIpsZE,2183119,2188160,by picking your arena and simply  stepping into it  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,2188160,2195359,you don't need to be the best or the  greatest or the most innovative no  that's for another day today if you want
InjJ7WIpsZE,2195359,2202000,to change your life  open the door and step
InjJ7WIpsZE,2202000,2208920,in  you'll be amazed at what transpires
InjJ7WIpsZE,2237520,2243320,why is this battle you  versus you
InjJ7WIpsZE,2243599,2248880,with all the complexity  all the obstacles out there
InjJ7WIpsZE,2248880,2253520,why are you  your greatest opponent
InjJ7WIpsZE,2254160,2260240,well to put it simply  because all those obstacles and all that
InjJ7WIpsZE,2260240,2266079,complexity  still can't tell you no  they can't say
InjJ7WIpsZE,2266079,2272800,enough is enough  they can't look back at you and say  let's just settle for what we have now
InjJ7WIpsZE,2272800,2277440,no only you  can do that
InjJ7WIpsZE,2278560,2284640,the world may create the landscape  it may construct the terrain and those
InjJ7WIpsZE,2284640,2292480,obstacles  but you are the sole decider  on where along the way you stop
InjJ7WIpsZE,2292480,2299359,you decide how far you want to go and  how much you are willing to endure
InjJ7WIpsZE,2299359,2304920,when it comes to your advancement or  limitation  you are in the driver's seat
InjJ7WIpsZE,2304920,2310960,[Music]  i just picked up a copy of will smith's  recent book
InjJ7WIpsZE,2310960,2317280,and one of the ideas that stood out to  me was resilience  and this part in the book
InjJ7WIpsZE,2317280,2323680,it's actually kind of uncomfortable to  get through but incredibly powerful  he's talking about his childhood and the
InjJ7WIpsZE,2323680,2330160,polarity of his father's personality  a man who would do anything to provide
InjJ7WIpsZE,2330160,2336560,for his family he took pride in that and  saw it as his primary responsibility
InjJ7WIpsZE,2336560,2343520,but  simultaneously was their greatest source  of pain  [Music]  and he mentions his father you know
InjJ7WIpsZE,2343520,2348800,hitting his mother from time to time in  one particular example  struck his mother
InjJ7WIpsZE,2348800,2354720,in the face so hard that it knocked her  on the floor  and as she stood back up she said
InjJ7WIpsZE,2354720,2361119,something along the lines of you can hit  me  but you can't hurt me
InjJ7WIpsZE,2361520,2368880,and that was the first time will  understood as a child the difference  between  uh what the outside world inflicts upon
InjJ7WIpsZE,2368880,2375839,us than how we choose to react to that  occurrence  that understanding
InjJ7WIpsZE,2375839,2381440,is power  that's why you are the author of your
InjJ7WIpsZE,2381440,2387760,story  in the sense that every single thing  dropped at your feet every situation
InjJ7WIpsZE,2387760,2392880,every occurrence  they come with an implicit question
InjJ7WIpsZE,2392880,2399359,attached a question that you and only  you are responsible for answering the  question is
InjJ7WIpsZE,2399359,2405359,what does this mean  and how you respond to that question
InjJ7WIpsZE,2405359,2412960,determines whether you go left or right  at that metaphorical fork in the road
InjJ7WIpsZE,2412960,2420160,does the occurrence detract from your  ambitions or is it a multiplier does it  confirm your doubts and insecurities or
InjJ7WIpsZE,2420160,2426160,is it your reason to rise to the  occasion an opportunity to stretch to
InjJ7WIpsZE,2426160,2432480,evolve  that's a gift that's an invite
InjJ7WIpsZE,2432480,2438640,not some sort of divine punishment  but the challenge is removing the layers
InjJ7WIpsZE,2438640,2443760,until you arrive at the value  and it's hard
InjJ7WIpsZE,2443760,2451119,but you get there by saying yes  you get there by choosing to see
InjJ7WIpsZE,2451119,2458240,the value  and here's a quick example my favorite  thing about athletics
InjJ7WIpsZE,2458240,2464800,which was for me a ton of running now i  throw  more interval training in there but the
InjJ7WIpsZE,2464800,2471839,same concepts apply it's a chance to  remind myself  that i don't negotiate with my weakness
InjJ7WIpsZE,2471839,2478160,i don't give myself an opportunity  to rationalize  with the voice that wants me to quit
InjJ7WIpsZE,2478160,2484720,that question that fork in the road i  answered it  i charted its course before the workout
InjJ7WIpsZE,2484720,2491359,started  knowing this is going to be  uncomfortable at times but it's where i
InjJ7WIpsZE,2491359,2497760,need to go  there will be no more thinking from here  on out
InjJ7WIpsZE,2497760,2504319,so today's workout for example switching  deadlifts burpees to squats to core
InjJ7WIpsZE,2504319,2512079,you don't think  you see the next requirement the next  task and you simply say yes you don't
InjJ7WIpsZE,2512079,2519440,need your mind for this  in fact you go before your mind even  knows where it's going
InjJ7WIpsZE,2519440,2527680,because that dotted line has already  been signed  and that was the breakthrough for me  when you separate what you have to do
InjJ7WIpsZE,2527680,2534079,with the hurt associated with doing that  thing you free yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,2534079,2540720,after all what's there to hold you back  if you can't talk yourself out of doing  things
InjJ7WIpsZE,2540720,2546240,see we tend to think our greatest  adversity is the pain or the confusion
InjJ7WIpsZE,2546240,2552640,or the unknown  but it's like no those are the  byproducts of doing anything of
InjJ7WIpsZE,2552640,2560640,significance  the adversary is the voice that begs you  to slow down because of those things
InjJ7WIpsZE,2560640,2566000,and if you can figure out in your own  life how to create space between the two
InjJ7WIpsZE,2566000,2572160,how to separate the task and the  discomfort often brought about by the  task
InjJ7WIpsZE,2572160,2578720,there's nothing that will ever be able  to slow you down  and look i'm not saying that you walk
InjJ7WIpsZE,2578720,2584400,around without ever utilizing the power  of that brilliant mind you possess
InjJ7WIpsZE,2584400,2591119,the one's ability to think is everything  but what i am saying is there is a time  to shut it off
InjJ7WIpsZE,2591119,2598079,there is a time in which to avoid  overthinking we simplify action reaction
InjJ7WIpsZE,2598079,2604160,one more mile okay end of story  one minute of jump squats next roger
InjJ7WIpsZE,2604160,2609599,that period it's taking the emotion out  of the process refusing to leave the
InjJ7WIpsZE,2609599,2614640,door cracked for the inner dialogue that  says hey maybe you don't do this maybe
InjJ7WIpsZE,2614640,2621200,you slow down are you sure you can  handle what's next  no all of that is tuned out it's
InjJ7WIpsZE,2621200,2628240,assignment go next go next go you know  this is the right thing you did your
InjJ7WIpsZE,2628240,2635119,thinking before grabbing the sword  shield and stepping into the arena
InjJ7WIpsZE,2635119,2642000,now guess what it's instinct it's doing  what has to be done  and what has to be done
InjJ7WIpsZE,2642000,2647440,hurts  and look you didn't have to accept that
InjJ7WIpsZE,2647440,2652960,you didn't have to step in  you could have stayed home
InjJ7WIpsZE,2652960,2659520,but somewhere  along the way you looked in the mirror  and said  the difficult path
InjJ7WIpsZE,2659520,2664640,is the one with the value  and now here you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,2664640,2670800,face to face with hungry lions  clashing swords with your adversaries
InjJ7WIpsZE,2670800,2678880,there's no turning back now  now is when you parse out pain from the  objective the pain is now part
InjJ7WIpsZE,2678880,2684720,of the audience  it's not with you or in you it's
InjJ7WIpsZE,2684720,2690720,watching from above  as you do what you came here to do
InjJ7WIpsZE,2690720,2696800,so yes those swords clash but the eyes  remain focused on what's ahead
InjJ7WIpsZE,2696800,2702079,and yes those lions roar but that's  background noise
InjJ7WIpsZE,2702079,2708480,when you simplify your world into  objective and action objective action
InjJ7WIpsZE,2708480,2714240,objective action there is time for  nothing but forward progress
InjJ7WIpsZE,2714240,2719920,and sometimes that is all that is  required of us in the face of adversity
InjJ7WIpsZE,2719920,2725119,in the face of pain self-doubt in the  face of discomfort
InjJ7WIpsZE,2725119,2732480,can you break your world down into  nothing but one single step forward
InjJ7WIpsZE,2732480,2739520,one more set one more rep  one more session one more attempt just
InjJ7WIpsZE,2739520,2746560,one more  no rocket science  no negotiation there's nothing to figure
InjJ7WIpsZE,2746560,2754400,out here  it's walking the path before you it's  the discipline to carry on it's one more
InjJ7WIpsZE,2754400,2762000,swing of the axe audience or no audience  lions are no lions you are bound to the
InjJ7WIpsZE,2762000,2768240,universe at your feet  and that simplified concentration  is why
InjJ7WIpsZE,2768240,2771960,you will succeed
InjJ7WIpsZE,2777260,2784079,[Music]  the road to this moment
InjJ7WIpsZE,2784079,2789119,wasn't an easy one  there were times where you thought you
InjJ7WIpsZE,2789119,2794640,knew  but simply didn't  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,2794640,2799920,there were plans made  that drastically differed from the ones
InjJ7WIpsZE,2799920,2805920,fate had prepared  [Music]  there were days that made you question
InjJ7WIpsZE,2805920,2814880,yourself  your beliefs  that made you ask what is my purpose
InjJ7WIpsZE,2815520,2822960,look to live is to have felt these  things  asked these questions
InjJ7WIpsZE,2823200,2829280,to have seen firsthand the discrepancy  between what we draw up and how life
InjJ7WIpsZE,2829280,2835440,unfolds  and i think about this discrepancy often
InjJ7WIpsZE,2835440,2840160,the swings and misses they hurt
InjJ7WIpsZE,2841440,2850079,you know that quick shiver you feel down  your spine  when thinking about the wrong turns mate
InjJ7WIpsZE,2850160,2856079,the tugging at your heart strings when  reflecting back on things said
InjJ7WIpsZE,2856079,2862880,or perhaps worse left unsaid  it's easy to get lost in that feedback
InjJ7WIpsZE,2862880,2872040,loop  letting the past dictate the present  letting yesterday define today
InjJ7WIpsZE,2872800,2880240,but here's what i've come to see as the  truth  to experience the things that make life
InjJ7WIpsZE,2880240,2888160,beautiful  we have to be vulnerable in a way we  otherwise wouldn't
InjJ7WIpsZE,2888240,2893359,open ourselves up to an unknown  that you know we could have skipped all
InjJ7WIpsZE,2893359,2898480,together if we really wanted to  all that pain
InjJ7WIpsZE,2898480,2904960,all that hurt the past provided could  very easily  be the reason you shut down the reason
InjJ7WIpsZE,2904960,2910240,you play small  that hell you walk through could be your
InjJ7WIpsZE,2910240,2918240,justification for never stepping out  into the chaos of life again
InjJ7WIpsZE,2919680,2926640,that would at first glance appear to  make sense  seem ideal
InjJ7WIpsZE,2926839,2933200,even but that pain  could also be the reason you look around
InjJ7WIpsZE,2933200,2940400,you and say after all that  after experiencing everything life threw
InjJ7WIpsZE,2940400,2945280,at me  i'm still here
InjJ7WIpsZE,2945599,2951839,and as i stand here now i'm looking out  at an array of possibility that is
InjJ7WIpsZE,2951839,2958160,infinite  i'm equipped with an understanding and a
InjJ7WIpsZE,2958160,2965760,world view that was once foreign to me  i'm armed with a perspective that has
InjJ7WIpsZE,2965760,2970880,changed my life for the better
InjJ7WIpsZE,2970880,2977200,by stepping out into the often dangerous  brutal unforgiving world i have elevated
InjJ7WIpsZE,2977200,2985838,myself  and that  has made all the difference
InjJ7WIpsZE,2986000,2993440,and while it may feel intuitive to run  from a reiteration of yesterday's pain
InjJ7WIpsZE,2993440,3000559,it's wisdom  that urges us to instead use that pain  as a multiplier
InjJ7WIpsZE,3000559,3008720,the key  to something more  something miraculous
InjJ7WIpsZE,3008960,3017200,not to cower  because we once endured it but to stand  tall because we overcame it
InjJ7WIpsZE,3017200,3025039,and that's what we often miss  we can think back to the adversity sure
InjJ7WIpsZE,3025280,3030960,but we're often unable to see how that  adversity shaped us
InjJ7WIpsZE,3032880,3037970,our own strength it's never going to  scream out at us it's never going to let  us know it's there
InjJ7WIpsZE,3037970,3044000,[Music]  we have to take the time to acknowledge  its presence
InjJ7WIpsZE,3044000,3050160,we have to peer over our shoulders to  see how far we've traveled
InjJ7WIpsZE,3051040,3057839,we'll always have obstacles before us  that if we don't stop and assess we
InjJ7WIpsZE,3057839,3065040,won't see that the obstacles have gotten  bigger  not because life's gotten harder
InjJ7WIpsZE,3065040,3071839,but because our own evolution has  permitted us to step into bigger arenas
InjJ7WIpsZE,3071839,3077599,it has equipped us to take on larger  adversaries
InjJ7WIpsZE,3078400,3084720,a simple willingness to be vulnerable  has become the flame
InjJ7WIpsZE,3084720,3091200,that lit up your soul  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,3091200,3098000,so the question is will you step out  you see that vulnerability not as a
InjJ7WIpsZE,3098000,3103040,crack in the foundation or a in  the armor but as
InjJ7WIpsZE,3103040,3109040,strength  [Music]  to love
InjJ7WIpsZE,3109040,3114558,it requires accepting a susceptibility  to being hurt
InjJ7WIpsZE,3115040,3122160,to play the game requires an acceptance  that you just might come up short
InjJ7WIpsZE,3122160,3129599,to bet on yourself means understanding  that you might fall  right on your face
InjJ7WIpsZE,3129599,3134800,to want more than you have now means  acknowledging that you might be humbled
InjJ7WIpsZE,3134800,3141760,along the way  this is what it means to live
InjJ7WIpsZE,3141920,3148319,giving a piece of yourself  in order to acquire that which means
InjJ7WIpsZE,3148319,3155920,the most  the torturous often counterintuitive  willingness to step out into the
InjJ7WIpsZE,3155920,3164400,darkness of night  when your heart races and your mind  moves a million miles a minute
InjJ7WIpsZE,3164640,3170079,that's vulnerable  that is power
InjJ7WIpsZE,3170160,3177040,and it's an investment in a tomorrow  that otherwise would not have been  available to you
InjJ7WIpsZE,3177040,3183280,you are not your past  you are the wisdom derived from its  lessons
InjJ7WIpsZE,3183280,3189920,the courage removed from its trials  and the hurt
InjJ7WIpsZE,3189920,3195839,that hurt that was perhaps  at one point the only thing you felt
InjJ7WIpsZE,3196480,3203310,it's not your reason to shrink into  yourself  it's your reason to step back out
InjJ7WIpsZE,3203310,3209200,[Music]  to say to the universe i have the  strength to again
InjJ7WIpsZE,3209200,3215440,dance with the unknown  to risk the short-term discomforts that
InjJ7WIpsZE,3215440,3221599,life often hands out like candy in  exchange for the chance years from now
InjJ7WIpsZE,3221599,3230480,to look at your reflection and say i got  back up  i did the hard thing i followed my heart
InjJ7WIpsZE,3230480,3237760,i wandered into that darkness to obtain  the wondrous reality that is for a time
InjJ7WIpsZE,3237760,3242480,concealed  i  did that
InjJ7WIpsZE,3243359,3249040,so love again  grow again
InjJ7WIpsZE,3249440,3256960,try again  build again  believe again
InjJ7WIpsZE,3256960,3264960,see  again  feel again step out into the world again
InjJ7WIpsZE,3264960,3271119,this is who you are  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,3271119,3276319,underneath the fear and insecurity
InjJ7WIpsZE,3276319,3283680,underneath all those reasons to not go  there lives the beginning of the miracle
InjJ7WIpsZE,3283680,3289119,that is life  [Music]  and it won't be easy the timing will
InjJ7WIpsZE,3289119,3296160,never feel perfect but the question will  always exist it will always exist within
InjJ7WIpsZE,3296160,3302160,an arm's reach of where you stand can  you be that vulnerable
InjJ7WIpsZE,3302160,3309359,can you be  that courageous  then not just when things are going well
InjJ7WIpsZE,3309359,3314880,but amidst the turmoil the chaos the  self-doubt
InjJ7WIpsZE,3314880,3320400,when your memory only wants to play  highlight reels of where things went  wrong
InjJ7WIpsZE,3320400,3327520,where you swung and missed  [Music]  will you choose to see those moments not
InjJ7WIpsZE,3327520,3334559,as the chains that confine you but as  the strength that elevates you will you
InjJ7WIpsZE,3334559,3342799,be vulnerable enough to give away some  of you in order to expand and transform
InjJ7WIpsZE,3342799,3355639,all of you  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,3358480,3366560,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,3370400,3378559,[Music]  when our backs are against the wall  we're forced to become more
InjJ7WIpsZE,3378720,3386160,when the clock is ticking we are tasked  with finding answers that hide among us
InjJ7WIpsZE,3386240,3393119,it's in the darkness we find light and  while lost we find ourselves
InjJ7WIpsZE,3393520,3398559,the paradox of life is that from our  pain  comes our purpose
InjJ7WIpsZE,3398559,3403720,our evolution and our greatness
InjJ7WIpsZE,3403810,3411280,[Music]  i love thinking back  to about 2014
InjJ7WIpsZE,3411280,3417520,making my way around boston  having just quit my job essentially  purposeless
InjJ7WIpsZE,3417520,3424400,clinging to a youtube channel and a  podcast idea that i would name your  world within
InjJ7WIpsZE,3424400,3430480,and why why do i think back why does  this mean everything to me
InjJ7WIpsZE,3430480,3437040,well because at the time  i knew nothing  i understood nothing
InjJ7WIpsZE,3437040,3443599,nothing about speaking or media audio  video nothing about running a business
InjJ7WIpsZE,3443599,3450079,but more importantly i knew very little  about life  and what's truly required to progress in
InjJ7WIpsZE,3450079,3456400,a world with  infinite moving parts  i didn't know that my lack of
InjJ7WIpsZE,3456400,3461599,understanding  is what made everything feel  overwhelming
InjJ7WIpsZE,3461599,3467760,and complex and that it was up to me to  simplify  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,3467760,3472839,i didn't know the extent to which i'd  have to befriend
InjJ7WIpsZE,3472839,3478160,failure and that was the most  eye-opening realization
InjJ7WIpsZE,3479119,3486559,because when you gravitate towards a  risk-free existence and you box yourself  in as i had for so long
InjJ7WIpsZE,3486559,3492720,of course you don't get the upside but  you also don't fail as dramatically  either
InjJ7WIpsZE,3492720,3498720,life was a simple game of cause and  effect  do work get result not much room for
InjJ7WIpsZE,3498720,3504960,more than that  and so stepping outside that box in the  way that i did
InjJ7WIpsZE,3504960,3511359,uh  changed some rules  i learned some things
InjJ7WIpsZE,3511359,3517119,first  you can spend time on something you can  exhaust energy on something
InjJ7WIpsZE,3517119,3522960,and get nothing in the short term for  your effort  and i mean nothing
InjJ7WIpsZE,3522960,3529119,unless you count getting your pride  stomped on  unless you count your friends
InjJ7WIpsZE,3529119,3534400,disappearing when you need them most  unless you count self-doubt in a  constant
InjJ7WIpsZE,3534400,3541520,worry about not amounting to anything i  mean these are very  raw very real human emotions
InjJ7WIpsZE,3541520,3548079,[Music]  they tend to arise when we start  something new but
InjJ7WIpsZE,3548079,3553440,in them is also the power  this is where the light bulb turns on
InjJ7WIpsZE,3553440,3561040,and the path emerges  it's where i learned that we only get  what we want when we endure or what we
InjJ7WIpsZE,3561040,3566880,don't  and what a foreign concept when you  think about it right it's like eddie
InjJ7WIpsZE,3566880,3573359,take this mic go stand in front of this  audience and pour your heart out  your knees are shaking chest is pounding
InjJ7WIpsZE,3573359,3581039,but dude trust me it'll be good for you  and funny enough it was
InjJ7WIpsZE,3581359,3586480,it was because the fear in my stomach  became the indicator
InjJ7WIpsZE,3586480,3592799,that something new something exciting  something more was around the corner
InjJ7WIpsZE,3592799,3599680,like pavlov's dog hearing that bell  anytime the fear kicked in i could feel
InjJ7WIpsZE,3599680,3606290,myself getting closer to something  meaningful to a higher version of myself
InjJ7WIpsZE,3606290,3612160,[Music]  the pain is an invite
InjJ7WIpsZE,3612400,3618319,the sheer terror  and let's face it that's what it feels  like sometimes
InjJ7WIpsZE,3618319,3623839,it's an upgrade  disguised as the monster that you think
InjJ7WIpsZE,3623839,3632240,you should be running from  when it is as i recently mentioned  the adversary you should befriend
InjJ7WIpsZE,3632240,3637920,we have to change our relationship with  discomfort because our initial  understanding
InjJ7WIpsZE,3637920,3644079,the one that comes stock in our minds is  never sufficient to build anything of
InjJ7WIpsZE,3644079,3650480,significance  its default setting is to preserve the  now
InjJ7WIpsZE,3650480,3655680,not expand it  and so just like those stock speakers
InjJ7WIpsZE,3655680,3662480,that came in my 1999  ford f-150 when i was in my early 20s
InjJ7WIpsZE,3662480,3670079,let's rip it out  let's customize  let's upgrade the quality of the sound
InjJ7WIpsZE,3670079,3677200,we hear and the things we say to  ourselves  what an advantage it is to know that the
InjJ7WIpsZE,3677200,3683359,hard things are what make us level up  to find that awareness
InjJ7WIpsZE,3683359,3690960,what a blessing  that when life's difficulty startles and  scatters the masses
InjJ7WIpsZE,3690960,3697599,you could be the one that remains  standing tall  seeking out the advantage amidst the
InjJ7WIpsZE,3697599,3704240,commotion  every little act of courage becomes more
InjJ7WIpsZE,3704240,3710799,and more meaningful powerful  but we must lose ourselves to find
InjJ7WIpsZE,3710799,3716640,ourselves  we must embrace our fears if we are to  become
InjJ7WIpsZE,3716640,3722319,courageous we must fail in order to  succeed and sure sometimes the price
InjJ7WIpsZE,3722319,3729760,seems steep  but i promise  not going costs more
InjJ7WIpsZE,3729760,3737039,wishing costs more if onlys  cost more
InjJ7WIpsZE,3737039,3742800,so maybe for you it isn't a youtube  channel or a speaking career maybe it's  something totally different
InjJ7WIpsZE,3742800,3748559,[Music]  but it is something  and should you bring yourself to pursue
InjJ7WIpsZE,3748559,3755440,that which your heart pulls you to  pursue  you'll have those moments of defeat
InjJ7WIpsZE,3755440,3761280,where you're mad at yourself for leaving  the comfort and safety of your previous  world
InjJ7WIpsZE,3761280,3768000,you'll have times where you have no idea  what to do where you feel alone or stuck
InjJ7WIpsZE,3768000,3775359,or unsure  the difference will be whether you see  this as the invite you've been waiting
InjJ7WIpsZE,3775359,3781280,for or the reason to turn around and  settle for less that's the question how
InjJ7WIpsZE,3781280,3789119,do you internalize all that emotion that  will feel like it is consuming you
InjJ7WIpsZE,3789119,3796000,i couldn't believe how strong that  temptation was to go back  nagging at me every day just come off
InjJ7WIpsZE,3796000,3801520,the edge just be comfortable again  but as my old coach would say in college
InjJ7WIpsZE,3801520,3808640,when we're doing wall sits or something  physically taxing  15 seconds
InjJ7WIpsZE,3808640,3815760,you can do anything for 15 seconds  and is in life just a culmination of 15
InjJ7WIpsZE,3815760,3821119,second windows  it's compartmentalizing the process it's
InjJ7WIpsZE,3821119,3826480,turning the difficult into the  advantages
InjJ7WIpsZE,3826480,3833359,you have the ability to not think like  everyone else  you have it within you to rewire your
InjJ7WIpsZE,3833359,3841039,previous conceptions of the world  to see darkness not as your reason to  hide from conjured up monsters but as
InjJ7WIpsZE,3841039,3848160,your invitation to become the light  remember that the best way to be more is
InjJ7WIpsZE,3848160,3853440,to have the courage to put your back  against the wall and you won't want to
InjJ7WIpsZE,3853440,3859839,in the moment there will never be a  perfect time  but committing to that vulnerability
InjJ7WIpsZE,3859839,3865440,will release from within you the power  the strength the greatness
InjJ7WIpsZE,3865440,3872119,that has been for so long tucked away  by moving into the chaos you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,3872119,3879599,simultaneously creating the calm you  always dreamed of  you're realizing the possibility that
InjJ7WIpsZE,3879599,3886400,just needed the door left a jar  to make its way
InjJ7WIpsZE,3886400,3891899,into your world  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,3902400,3905699,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,3914880,3920720,don't you dare reach for your pocket  i told myself
InjJ7WIpsZE,3921039,3927760,in fact  take that phone  and go put it in another room
InjJ7WIpsZE,3927760,3934400,shut your internet off set your devices  to do not disturb  and think
InjJ7WIpsZE,3934400,3944160,please  think  [Music]  you are losing yourself to distraction
InjJ7WIpsZE,3944160,3949200,or as cal newport puts it  you know we're in a world that demands
InjJ7WIpsZE,3949200,3954960,more thought more deep work than ever  before  while we all simultaneously become more
InjJ7WIpsZE,3954960,3961200,and more incapable of that focus  and to me it feels like
InjJ7WIpsZE,3961200,3968480,more than  a chuckle at our outrageous screen time  or a self-deprecating joke
InjJ7WIpsZE,3968480,3975359,about how reliant we are  on our phones that the dopamine hit  you know i think it's antithetical
InjJ7WIpsZE,3975359,3982319,overall to what we need  to where we find our purpose
InjJ7WIpsZE,3983680,3990400,which is a dichotomy that's  frustratingly true with so many things  right that balance for me to have a
InjJ7WIpsZE,3990400,3998400,digital business that means so much to  me that i'm so proud of but also  tiptoeing around that same digital world
InjJ7WIpsZE,3998400,4005680,like it's a hungry lion capable of  devouring me  that's that's a real feeling it's
InjJ7WIpsZE,4005680,4011599,water that's foundational for life but  in too large a quantity will kill it's
InjJ7WIpsZE,4011599,4017200,the sun that while integral and  responsible for this planet as we know  it
InjJ7WIpsZE,4017200,4022559,also has no problem ending you know  anything that's too openly exposed to
InjJ7WIpsZE,4022559,4028319,its rays to its heat  there's always a sweet spot
InjJ7WIpsZE,4028319,4035280,between too much and not enough  like that happy medium that intersection
InjJ7WIpsZE,4035280,4041760,is why we're all here  because when i don't take time to deeply
InjJ7WIpsZE,4041760,4047680,think when i lose the big picture  i remain in a cycle of routine
InjJ7WIpsZE,4047680,4054400,and sometimes that's great right morning  routine is great i don't really have to  think about it i'm programmed things
InjJ7WIpsZE,4054400,4061440,like driving a car as do he explains in  the power of habit your foot  stepping on the gas it's involuntary and
InjJ7WIpsZE,4061440,4067359,thank god for that  but one must be able to step outside
InjJ7WIpsZE,4067359,4074079,that loop and ask the big picture  questions  we have to make time to at least roughly
InjJ7WIpsZE,4074079,4081440,chart the course  and it'll change  life will present its obstacles but
InjJ7WIpsZE,4081440,4086799,will have at least parsed out what  matters and what doesn't
InjJ7WIpsZE,4086799,4092799,when life is all habit and reflex  when you've lost the ability to examine
InjJ7WIpsZE,4092799,4099198,the self because one minute alone with  your thoughts is agonizing
InjJ7WIpsZE,4099359,4105630,well you you won't be able to see past  the surface of who you are and what  you're capable of
InjJ7WIpsZE,4105630,4110640,[Music]  i want to be clear here this is not me
InjJ7WIpsZE,4110640,4116238,uh complaining about perhaps the most  prosperous society ever to exist this is
InjJ7WIpsZE,4116238,4123199,me saying  you know there are some dangers that we  way too easily overlook
InjJ7WIpsZE,4123199,4132960,that when you outsource your thinking  you outsource your future  and it's not hard to fall into that trap
InjJ7WIpsZE,4132960,4138640,i just referenced the book deep work a  few minutes ago  um  i think it's one of the most important
InjJ7WIpsZE,4138640,4146318,books someone can read in this day and  age you know cal newport talking about  separating ourselves from distraction
InjJ7WIpsZE,4146318,4153758,i remember the day i first listened to  that book i was sick so i wasn't on my  usual run i was walking and uh because
InjJ7WIpsZE,4153758,4159838,of that i felt this urge to  as the the book was playing to reach  into my pocket and check for
InjJ7WIpsZE,4159838,4166159,notifications  and  it really was eye-opening it's like
InjJ7WIpsZE,4166159,4171440,we are scared to completely immerse  ourselves in solitude
InjJ7WIpsZE,4171440,4176880,but solitude is where we uncover so much  silence
InjJ7WIpsZE,4176880,4183440,is where we hear what our souls have to  say it's where we understand who we are
InjJ7WIpsZE,4183440,4190560,my favorite joseph campbell quote the  cave you fear holds the treasure you  seek and man i hate to say it but
InjJ7WIpsZE,4190560,4195840,i think being alone even for a short  period of time is that monster lurking
InjJ7WIpsZE,4195840,4202320,in the cave  [Music]  you know the one we're scared to  confront even though it's what we need
InjJ7WIpsZE,4202320,4210080,solitude is the demon we are  consistently masking in a constant  influx of media and small talk and dms
InjJ7WIpsZE,4210080,4217600,and emails  you know that stuff has its value but  it's it's not real
InjJ7WIpsZE,4217600,4224080,in the sense that i find it  disconnected from  purpose
InjJ7WIpsZE,4224080,4229840,so here's something that i've been doing  and you know i would suggest that you  give it a try it's been certainly
InjJ7WIpsZE,4229840,4235920,helpful in my life and start small even  if it's 15 minutes but take a walk by  yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,4235920,4242480,no phone and it's challenging at first  because you know  you want to be consuming something even
InjJ7WIpsZE,4242480,4247520,if it's um you know educational valuable  still
InjJ7WIpsZE,4247520,4254320,right no phone  solitude think about life  think about who you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,4254320,4259360,think about what you've always wanted  and where your current reality aligns
InjJ7WIpsZE,4259360,4265120,think about how much you have and how  lucky you are think about any or all of  these things but
InjJ7WIpsZE,4265120,4272400,think  let your mind go where  amidst the push and pull of life you
InjJ7WIpsZE,4272400,4276640,don't often let it wander
InjJ7WIpsZE,4278080,4284640,for example some thoughts  from my walk today  some of it random sporadic noise some of
InjJ7WIpsZE,4284640,4291199,it more valuable than others but all of  it valuable because the process in its  entirety is valuable
InjJ7WIpsZE,4291199,4297440,you know i spend some time thinking  about the week ahead  the things i'm excited about and how to  prepare for them
InjJ7WIpsZE,4297440,4302640,and realize  one of them i i didn't want to do then  had that debate with myself well do i
InjJ7WIpsZE,4302640,4308719,not want to do it because it doesn't  align with my goals or because it makes  me uncomfortable came to the conclusion
InjJ7WIpsZE,4308719,4315679,that i think it's the latter so it's  staying in my schedule but i'll  reassess i thought about florida i
InjJ7WIpsZE,4315679,4320719,consistently think about how lucky i am  to be down here after living in so many  cold places
InjJ7WIpsZE,4320719,4327040,um it's just such a  beautiful environment and uh you know  one that i don't take for granted i
InjJ7WIpsZE,4327040,4332560,thought about  a statement i just heard from a  professional athlete
InjJ7WIpsZE,4332560,4338400,after his surgery talking about how hard  it was on him but that he would rise  from the ashes and he would have the
InjJ7WIpsZE,4338400,4345360,best year of his life and  you know my mind went to one of the most  important roles of leadership that
InjJ7WIpsZE,4345360,4350880,it's not about you or your rise or fall  right to lead is to make it about the
InjJ7WIpsZE,4350880,4358080,team about the overall goal  and how grateful i was to come across  that video to see that and really
InjJ7WIpsZE,4358080,4363440,dissect it  you know sometimes the best ways we  learn  um
InjJ7WIpsZE,4363440,4368520,is by seeing what not to do right and  i'll take that with me i'll take that
InjJ7WIpsZE,4368520,4375360,understanding uh with me on my own  journey  last thing i remember i thought about
InjJ7WIpsZE,4375360,4380560,some of the books i've been consuming  i've taken in an insane amount of books  over the years
InjJ7WIpsZE,4380560,4386560,but i practically stopped reading  physical books right and now i consume  mostly on audible or other audiobook
InjJ7WIpsZE,4386560,4392480,methods made me wonder whether the value  is equivalent  how much that varies from person to
InjJ7WIpsZE,4392480,4399199,person maybe something to research later  right that's that's all i remember as i  sit here now but the point is
InjJ7WIpsZE,4399199,4405520,you know this is stuff that if i don't  immerse myself in solitude and break  through the barrier of boredom i don't
InjJ7WIpsZE,4405520,4410719,get to  you know and maybe you go through a week
InjJ7WIpsZE,4410719,4416400,where you don't find much  but as the saying goes right one idea
InjJ7WIpsZE,4416400,4422159,one concept one epiphany can truly  change the dynamic of your life
InjJ7WIpsZE,4422159,4428400,could change everything  right there are answers just beyond the  realm of distraction we operate in
InjJ7WIpsZE,4428400,4433679,some of them pertain to trivialities  like the audiobooks in the cold front  some of them pertain to your goals and
InjJ7WIpsZE,4433679,4441280,your development who you are  where you're going and how you'll get  there  as newport says to simply wait and be
InjJ7WIpsZE,4441280,4447360,bored has become a novel experience in  modern life  and while his emphasis and focus is
InjJ7WIpsZE,4447360,4453520,primarily on work and creating an  environment to be productive  i want to suggest that
InjJ7WIpsZE,4453520,4460560,it's not only our work that needs saving  but ourselves  we can't lose touch with what matters
InjJ7WIpsZE,4460560,4465679,most we can't become so shallow in our  thoughts and our actions that the beauty
InjJ7WIpsZE,4465679,4471360,remains buried away  there is something in you that's
InjJ7WIpsZE,4471360,4477600,untapped unfinished raw talent or desire  there are pieces of you that need to be
InjJ7WIpsZE,4477600,4484360,assembled  and if left alone will wither away
InjJ7WIpsZE,4484360,4490480,unremarkably quietly  and probably without your noticing
InjJ7WIpsZE,4490480,4498159,so my ask  is that you think of this as  more than you know me cheering on long
InjJ7WIpsZE,4498159,4504640,walks it's not about the walks right  it's about time alone with yourself and
InjJ7WIpsZE,4504640,4509920,what that opens up for you  it's about recognizing the spaces we
InjJ7WIpsZE,4509920,4515840,need to carve out from the outside world  so that when we re-enter the outside
InjJ7WIpsZE,4515840,4521440,world we know who we are we understand  where we're headed
InjJ7WIpsZE,4521440,4527280,we don't go where the wind blows we are  able as the saying goes to adjust our
InjJ7WIpsZE,4527280,4534560,sails to get to our destination  all you need is more time
InjJ7WIpsZE,4534560,4538920,with  you
InjJ7WIpsZE,4562880,4568800,there's a quote from naval ravikant  he says the closer you are to the truth
InjJ7WIpsZE,4568800,4574960,the more silent you become inside  found that interesting
InjJ7WIpsZE,4574960,4582880,i got an email recently from someone  asking for my thoughts about their being  overlooked for a promotion at their work
InjJ7WIpsZE,4582880,4588800,they say that they're dedicated they  work hard they show up and execute
InjJ7WIpsZE,4588800,4595280,so what is the act of being overlooked  me  well like so many things it's contextual
InjJ7WIpsZE,4595280,4601920,but let's play with it right what does  feedback ever really mean  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,4601920,4606480,it means  what you decide it does
InjJ7WIpsZE,4607280,4614159,here's how i see the act of being  overlooked as this person expresses  let's look at it as an iceberg that
InjJ7WIpsZE,4614159,4620800,rejection  as a a floating block of ice in the  atlantic and the top the piece that's
InjJ7WIpsZE,4620800,4627040,exposed in above water the smaller piece  is your chance to look around and
InjJ7WIpsZE,4627040,4633040,self-reflect  to ask why  where the places i could strengthen
InjJ7WIpsZE,4633040,4639199,myself  the gaps i could close and the spaces i  could occupy
InjJ7WIpsZE,4639199,4645760,you know disappointment  uh it causes us to self-reflect and that  can be a valuable thing
InjJ7WIpsZE,4645760,4651040,there are often tangible quantifiable  reasons we didn't hit the mark and i  think
InjJ7WIpsZE,4651040,4658880,that top of the iceberg is our  recognition that we have things to do  places to go and what better a time
InjJ7WIpsZE,4658880,4666680,than now  to start moving in that direction  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,4666880,4672880,now the part of the iceberg underneath  the water supporting all that
InjJ7WIpsZE,4672880,4680159,there has to be a foundation of  self-belief of self-trust  not only a hardness and understanding
InjJ7WIpsZE,4680159,4686480,that you are not defined by rejection  but also a certainty that things will
InjJ7WIpsZE,4686480,4691520,work out  that you might have to stumble
InjJ7WIpsZE,4691520,4698158,fall  even aimlessly wander for a set period  of time
InjJ7WIpsZE,4698560,4704880,but when your focus is on a particular  north star and you are serious about it
InjJ7WIpsZE,4704880,4710000,committed to it  you'll find a way  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,4710000,4716000,and being overlooked in any capacity  is not defining because right now is not
InjJ7WIpsZE,4716000,4722400,an end  you decide where the end is  there just so happens to be a lot of
InjJ7WIpsZE,4722400,4728480,space between that point  and where you stand now
InjJ7WIpsZE,4729440,4734560,the vast majority of an iceberg exists  under the surface and that's valuable
InjJ7WIpsZE,4734560,4739920,here  because i believe that the  differentiator when it comes to success
InjJ7WIpsZE,4739920,4744960,and failure is how one internalizes  the process
InjJ7WIpsZE,4744960,4751199,and their place within it  [Music]  if you know you're going to succeed
InjJ7WIpsZE,4751199,4756560,if you are confident in yourself and who  you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,4756560,4764800,then the little wins and losses along  the way tend to mean less  getting overlooked in any capacity
InjJ7WIpsZE,4764800,4770080,is a nice little bit of feedback but in  the grand scheme of things it doesn't  hold the weight
InjJ7WIpsZE,4770080,4775150,we tend to give it when we're less sure  of ourselves and the process
InjJ7WIpsZE,4775150,4783600,[Music]  so let's get back to the quote  the closer you are to the truth the more
InjJ7WIpsZE,4783600,4789840,silent you become inside  well here naval is stating uh in one of
InjJ7WIpsZE,4789840,4795920,his podcast episodes that the wiser  someone becomes the more quiet or stoic
InjJ7WIpsZE,4795920,4801840,they become  referring to the character that i allude  to all the time in this podcast the
InjJ7WIpsZE,4801840,4806960,loudest person at the table right always  talking or seeking attention
InjJ7WIpsZE,4806960,4812159,often this character's over compensating  for something and that's what naval is
InjJ7WIpsZE,4812159,4817199,in my opinion properly stating  but i want to hijack the quote a little
InjJ7WIpsZE,4817199,4824159,bit  because i think this applies to our own  mental chatter as well
InjJ7WIpsZE,4824159,4831679,when we are sure of ourselves and what  we're doing  the internal dialogue is reduced
InjJ7WIpsZE,4831679,4837679,when we believe ourselves to be correct  and in line with our values and our  vision
InjJ7WIpsZE,4837679,4844159,the mind tends to be calmer  and i can use  this youtube channel and podcast as an
InjJ7WIpsZE,4844159,4849360,easy example  right i have self-belief when it comes  to my ability to do this i've invested
InjJ7WIpsZE,4849360,4854719,years and years and  believe that over time it's become a  strength of mine
InjJ7WIpsZE,4854719,4862080,so when that inevitable negative  feedback or comment comes in  which happens right it's the internet
InjJ7WIpsZE,4862080,4867600,i take it for what it is it's the tip of  the iceberg  i assess whether there's any value to be
InjJ7WIpsZE,4867600,4876639,extracted and  if there is i put it in my back pocket  [Music]  but the point is i then move on
InjJ7WIpsZE,4876639,4883679,because underneath the surface under  that tip of the iceberg there is such a  substantial amount of self-belief and
InjJ7WIpsZE,4883679,4890159,determination in the process  that negativity it means very little
InjJ7WIpsZE,4890159,4896880,doesn't define me  and that's the point that i aspire to  cling to
InjJ7WIpsZE,4896880,4903360,and conversely as counterintuitive as it  seems  i think we should be the same way with  positive feedback
InjJ7WIpsZE,4903360,4908400,right like when nice things are said it  makes us feel good and we should be  grateful sure
InjJ7WIpsZE,4908400,4914639,but the idea is the same examine pocket  the feedback and move on because if we  rely
InjJ7WIpsZE,4914639,4920560,too extensively on good feedback for our  self-worth and our sense of identity
InjJ7WIpsZE,4920560,4926639,it's going to be hard to avoid doing the  same thing when the other stuff comes in
InjJ7WIpsZE,4926880,4933520,it's about having a vision and trusting  yourself right this is not you versus
InjJ7WIpsZE,4933520,4938960,the world this is you versus you and we  can't forget that
InjJ7WIpsZE,4938960,4944560,it's a person committed determined on  fire in their purpose
InjJ7WIpsZE,4944560,4951440,collecting data along the way to  something greater and look sometimes  that data comes in the form of being
InjJ7WIpsZE,4951440,4957360,overlooked it highlights ways you need  to make yourself stronger and better
InjJ7WIpsZE,4957360,4962800,but sometimes it validates and  recognizes your greatness the value
InjJ7WIpsZE,4962800,4969440,you're already adding to the world  either way  you're moving forward because it's who
InjJ7WIpsZE,4969440,4974719,you are  and as long as you tell yourself you're  going to win
InjJ7WIpsZE,4974719,4981280,and those two feet underneath you  haven't stopped moving  you're putting yourself in position to
InjJ7WIpsZE,4981280,4987600,capitalize  on all the opportunity life has to  provide you are going to see the
InjJ7WIpsZE,4987600,4993760,compounding of all those steps you took  the ones you took when it hurt and the
InjJ7WIpsZE,4993760,4999600,ones you took when it didn't  when you were sure and when you weren't
InjJ7WIpsZE,4999600,5008320,when you had all the energy in the world  and when you barely got yourself through
InjJ7WIpsZE,5008320,5014480,all those times they mean something  and it's the ability and desire to move
InjJ7WIpsZE,5014480,5019679,forward regardless  that becomes the determining factor
InjJ7WIpsZE,5019679,5026840,if you know that the mind can be at  peace life is happening for you not to
InjJ7WIpsZE,5026840,5033360,you the obstacles become much needed  information and the victories further
InjJ7WIpsZE,5033360,5039360,contribute to your momentum  it's all moving you closer to where you
InjJ7WIpsZE,5039360,5049040,need to  be there's a saying by steve martin he  says be so good they can't ignore you
InjJ7WIpsZE,5049360,5054960,and that's not a point it's a process  an evolution
InjJ7WIpsZE,5054960,5061360,it takes time it takes patience it takes  self-belief
InjJ7WIpsZE,5061360,5067760,but trusting that mountaintop you're  chasing  also comes with a great sense of
InjJ7WIpsZE,5067760,5073120,security  that this epic adventure is yours and  yours alone
InjJ7WIpsZE,5073120,5078880,it comes with discovery growth joy  sadness and everything in between but it
InjJ7WIpsZE,5078880,5085360,is yours  and if you sign that dotted line
InjJ7WIpsZE,5085360,5090880,it doesn't matter if you are overlooked  in some capacity
InjJ7WIpsZE,5090880,5096320,no person or external event  can take away
InjJ7WIpsZE,5096320,5103239,what you know in your soul  to be true
InjJ7WIpsZE,5105560,5111649,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,5120500,5126000,[Music]  sometimes the inspiration doesn't come
InjJ7WIpsZE,5126000,5133840,to you  [Music]  no sometimes you have to go out  and find it
InjJ7WIpsZE,5134880,5140239,when it hurts the most  when the deck seems stacked against you
InjJ7WIpsZE,5140239,5145620,when the road to travel  seems to be longer than you can endure
InjJ7WIpsZE,5145620,5150639,[Music]  these are the times we're tasked
InjJ7WIpsZE,5150639,5155840,not with waiting  but with creating
InjJ7WIpsZE,5156080,5161199,and those lows  they become highs because they force us
InjJ7WIpsZE,5161199,5166320,to self-assess  to look around and say i don't want to
InjJ7WIpsZE,5166320,5172400,feel this way anymore i'm done  tolerating x accepting y associating
InjJ7WIpsZE,5172400,5179199,with z and so a bridge  must be created to something
InjJ7WIpsZE,5179199,5187040,and your question is simply what's that  something  going to look like
InjJ7WIpsZE,5188639,5194080,here's what's interesting  knowing what you don't want
InjJ7WIpsZE,5194080,5201120,is often the beginning  it breathes life into a first step
InjJ7WIpsZE,5201120,5206400,maybe you look up and you have no idea  what step 2 000 or 3000 looks like and
InjJ7WIpsZE,5206400,5212239,that's perfectly okay  you don't need to know exactly where
InjJ7WIpsZE,5212239,5217600,you're headed  exactly what the top of the mountain  will look like  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,5217600,5224000,what took me forever to figure out  is knowing that here isn't right for you
InjJ7WIpsZE,5224000,5230480,wherever here is  is enough  because it is the beginning
InjJ7WIpsZE,5230480,5236719,the engine  that makes it all  work you don't owe explanations
InjJ7WIpsZE,5236719,5242800,apologies aren't required of you  all you needed was that feeling in your
InjJ7WIpsZE,5242800,5248400,stomach that more is out there and  perhaps you've been depriving yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,5248400,5253840,of it  for a tad too long
InjJ7WIpsZE,5254080,5260560,you just need to leave scarcity behind  and train your eyes to find the
InjJ7WIpsZE,5260560,5266280,abundance you exist  within
InjJ7WIpsZE,5267040,5273920,the other day i saw a quick interview  tiger woods was giving  and i'm not really a big golf guy but
InjJ7WIpsZE,5273920,5279600,when the greats talk  i listen  and those who have been following him
InjJ7WIpsZE,5279600,5286880,know that he's had kind of a rocky past  right a very public  uh you know family situation to injuries
InjJ7WIpsZE,5286880,5294639,surgeries a recent car accident  and you can only want someone like that  to rise from the ashes right i feel like
InjJ7WIpsZE,5294639,5300480,everyone's rooting for him to rediscover  the dominance he once possessed
InjJ7WIpsZE,5300480,5306719,and basically in this interview the  interviewer's asking him about day one  of the masters where
InjJ7WIpsZE,5306719,5311840,tiger played well enough to make the cut  you know he survived day one and was
InjJ7WIpsZE,5311840,5317679,about to continue  uh the the tournament into the weekend  but it certainly wasn't the best golf
InjJ7WIpsZE,5317679,5324560,he's ever played  and so upon reflecting on it he says  and i'm paraphrasing
InjJ7WIpsZE,5324560,5329840,things aren't the way i'd like them to  feel  but i've given myself
InjJ7WIpsZE,5329840,5336159,a chance  and i love the way that sounded right
InjJ7WIpsZE,5336159,5343040,not just because it came from a man  who's been metaphorically battling  uphill for what feels like some time now
InjJ7WIpsZE,5343040,5349840,but  because it's how we all reemerge from  our adversity  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,5349840,5356480,it doesn't matter what happened  yesterday  your past all of it the ups and downs
InjJ7WIpsZE,5356480,5365280,the bumps and bruises  they've all brought you here  and if life is one giant tournament
InjJ7WIpsZE,5365280,5370960,you've made the cut  you get to play in your masters
InjJ7WIpsZE,5370960,5376480,tomorrow is coming  and it brings with it the chance to
InjJ7WIpsZE,5376480,5381920,right the ship  to discover the undiscovered to find
InjJ7WIpsZE,5381920,5388239,yourself again  by showing up today
InjJ7WIpsZE,5388239,5393440,you've given yourself a chance and that  is the most powerful thing one can
InjJ7WIpsZE,5393440,5400560,possess  a chance  [Music]  i think too often we look at what we
InjJ7WIpsZE,5400560,5408560,don't have  we spend our time focusing on the holes  the blank spaces the gaps
InjJ7WIpsZE,5408560,5416000,instead of looking at the opportunity  we've created  to pivot wherever we deem necessary
InjJ7WIpsZE,5416000,5424000,the flexibility is the asset  but only valuable when we recognize and
InjJ7WIpsZE,5424000,5429440,utilize it  and yeah that can feel like a tall order
InjJ7WIpsZE,5429440,5435440,when we are not at our best  when we're operating at a level that
InjJ7WIpsZE,5435440,5442000,let's say is less than ideal  it's easy to see all the problems we're
InjJ7WIpsZE,5442000,5447320,going through as supporting evidence  that the world is bigger than us that we  are
InjJ7WIpsZE,5447320,5453520,outmatched by life  but really
InjJ7WIpsZE,5453520,5458960,all these things that have come together  to create our current state
InjJ7WIpsZE,5458960,5464400,they're nothing more than life providing  you a chance
InjJ7WIpsZE,5464400,5469600,an opportunity to turn  the page  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,5469600,5476480,from a tiger  you know those lows those setbacks  and perhaps even the personal anguish
InjJ7WIpsZE,5476480,5481679,one would assume would  uh accompany those things they've given  him the gift
InjJ7WIpsZE,5481679,5487678,of now  and he recognizes that
InjJ7WIpsZE,5487760,5493679,just like everything that has paved the  way for you has done the same
InjJ7WIpsZE,5493679,5499760,it's created the conditions from which  you can now grow further evolve
InjJ7WIpsZE,5499760,5505760,[Music]  it's providing a little nudge towards  those things we need to do but
InjJ7WIpsZE,5505760,5510719,maybe sometimes drag our feet a little  too long
InjJ7WIpsZE,5512400,5518800,so when the world throws you curveballs  how about seeing the situation as a
InjJ7WIpsZE,5518800,5525520,chance  to hit off speed  to step up to the plate
InjJ7WIpsZE,5525520,5534239,and make something of what we thought  was misfortune  when one trades it's happening to me
InjJ7WIpsZE,5534239,5540000,for  it's happening for me  you're presented advantages that were
InjJ7WIpsZE,5540000,5545120,previously unavailable  they weren't there
InjJ7WIpsZE,5545120,5552159,and not because they didn't exist  they weren't there because they weren't  recognized
InjJ7WIpsZE,5552159,5557600,because perhaps you saw the very thing  that could help you as the thing that
InjJ7WIpsZE,5557600,5563520,would hurt you  but regardless
InjJ7WIpsZE,5563520,5570880,here you are  sharpened by the mistakes you made and  shaped by the lessons you learned
InjJ7WIpsZE,5570880,5576400,you are here  not to relive the past but to create a
InjJ7WIpsZE,5576400,5582239,new reality write a new chapter walk a  new path  you
InjJ7WIpsZE,5582239,5588960,are here  and wherever next happens to be
InjJ7WIpsZE,5588960,5594239,let it unfold  because you chose it
InjJ7WIpsZE,5594239,5601600,let it evolve  because it's who you are  leave the stands and make your way to
InjJ7WIpsZE,5601600,5609198,the stage  we're sure the stakes are higher but so  is the upside
InjJ7WIpsZE,5609520,5617199,i often talk about the power of looking  over our shoulders at those highs and  lows from time to time
InjJ7WIpsZE,5617199,5623120,not because they have power over us  but because they have made us powerful
InjJ7WIpsZE,5623120,5628840,[Music]  look at all you've
InjJ7WIpsZE,5628840,5635600,endured see all that you've overcome and  for what
InjJ7WIpsZE,5635600,5641360,well  to put it simply  for the gift currently at your
InjJ7WIpsZE,5641360,5646880,fingertips  chance to say years from now
InjJ7WIpsZE,5646880,5654080,that sure you lost yourself  [Music]  things became chaotic confusing
InjJ7WIpsZE,5654080,5660000,convoluted maybe you were unsure maybe  at times you even felt alone but those
InjJ7WIpsZE,5660000,5666880,times  the same times that could have kept you  down
InjJ7WIpsZE,5666880,5674159,instead reminded you what you were  capable of becoming
InjJ7WIpsZE,5674400,5681360,you don't get the light  at the end of the tunnel without walking  through the darkness and so to remember
InjJ7WIpsZE,5681360,5687119,that  that all this has  unfolded to bring about something
InjJ7WIpsZE,5687119,5693920,beautiful on the other side well that  just might be the perspective  that you've needed that you've left
InjJ7WIpsZE,5693920,5699600,behind  the world
InjJ7WIpsZE,5699600,5706880,will only give you what you ask for and  so right here  right now
InjJ7WIpsZE,5706880,5712639,instead of accepting a continuation of  your past
InjJ7WIpsZE,5712639,5718159,how about demanding an evolution of  yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,5718719,5724670,that game of life awaits  and so for your sake and the world
InjJ7WIpsZE,5724670,5735109,[Music]  don't be afraid to play  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,5750120,5755360,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,5755360,5762800,she had a picture framed on the table  that said make today  amazing
InjJ7WIpsZE,5762800,5769360,place there to remind her  just how much of life  is a choice
InjJ7WIpsZE,5769360,5776719,how much we get to decide  it symbolizes that on our worst days
InjJ7WIpsZE,5776719,5781840,life hands us lessons  and on our best days
InjJ7WIpsZE,5781840,5788880,the highs of existence  during our low points
InjJ7WIpsZE,5788880,5798320,currency  and during our high points the chance to  cash it all in
InjJ7WIpsZE,5798320,5805520,yeah make today amazing  because today's are few and far between
InjJ7WIpsZE,5805520,5811119,today's are not an inconvenience  nor an obligation
InjJ7WIpsZE,5811119,5818400,today's  are what it's all about  today is the big show
InjJ7WIpsZE,5818400,5824480,the answers we look for  the destinations we long for
InjJ7WIpsZE,5824800,5830719,today is a place of dreams  that is
InjJ7WIpsZE,5830719,5836320,if you choose to leave room in your  world  for dreaming
InjJ7WIpsZE,5836960,5842639,today is the beginning  of wherever next is for you
InjJ7WIpsZE,5842639,5848000,a chance to see the new  and normalize it
InjJ7WIpsZE,5848000,5853119,to stretch to reach further out and pull  impossible
InjJ7WIpsZE,5853119,5859490,a little closer  into your orbit  you can do that
InjJ7WIpsZE,5859490,5864639,[Music]  and while one often can't control what
InjJ7WIpsZE,5864639,5870239,they are given  they can control what becomes of what
InjJ7WIpsZE,5870239,5877520,they are given  like architects and designers  engineering what will be
InjJ7WIpsZE,5877520,5883280,in what the malleable world around them  will become  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,5883280,5888880,when one raises their standards life  seems to accommodate
InjJ7WIpsZE,5888880,5894000,because believing it means acting the  part  means making the changes
InjJ7WIpsZE,5894000,5900719,means the external world makes room  means your identity is reinforced and so
InjJ7WIpsZE,5900719,5907040,the cycle goes by making today amazing  you are making yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,5907040,5912320,more  [Music]  decisions are the beginning
InjJ7WIpsZE,5912320,5919199,of all things  [Music]  see very rarely is the tool
InjJ7WIpsZE,5919199,5927040,in and of itself the differentiator  it's the vision that pulls us through
InjJ7WIpsZE,5927040,5933600,and if you take something arbitrary  say a hammer there's no way to
InjJ7WIpsZE,5933600,5939920,based upon its existence determine what  it will mean or what will become of it
InjJ7WIpsZE,5939920,5945280,a hammer can be an agent of chaos it can  smash and shatter and destroy it can be
InjJ7WIpsZE,5945280,5951600,the thing used to tear down  or
InjJ7WIpsZE,5951600,5959600,it can be what built  they can connect  it can alter and redefine so that
InjJ7WIpsZE,5959600,5965679,something  when all is said and done  is brought into an existence that never
InjJ7WIpsZE,5965679,5971760,was  it was never the tool
InjJ7WIpsZE,5971920,5979280,it was how the eyes viewed the tool it  was the vision that designated the roles
InjJ7WIpsZE,5979280,5986880,that made  today  amazing  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,5987360,5993040,and the reason we all need this reminder  as far as i can tell
InjJ7WIpsZE,5993040,5999118,is because the difficult things just so  happen to be the meaningful thing
InjJ7WIpsZE,5999280,6004560,because we are fighting  not against some little rule or idea we
InjJ7WIpsZE,6004560,6011280,picked up along the way we are fighting  against our dna  against thousands
InjJ7WIpsZE,6011280,6015760,and thousands of years of evolution
InjJ7WIpsZE,6016400,6021440,because the fear that kept our ancestors  alert  and alive
InjJ7WIpsZE,6021440,6028000,now in a totally new world keeps us  contained  and our talents minimized
InjJ7WIpsZE,6028000,6033199,the approval of others that kept us safe  and secure as we once traveled the
InjJ7WIpsZE,6033199,6038880,landscape in small groups hunting and  gathering  well now it keeps us needlessly looking
InjJ7WIpsZE,6038880,6044480,over our shoulders  and craving acceptance
InjJ7WIpsZE,6044560,6051679,the unknowns that kept us out of the  dark cave with the predator living in  its shadows
InjJ7WIpsZE,6051679,6060159,now keeps us confined  looking out at life's potential through  self-made windows
InjJ7WIpsZE,6060159,6066320,we need to be reminded to make today  amazing  because those things are quite the
InjJ7WIpsZE,6066320,6074480,adversaries  because our default is to just let the  ship sail our default is to simply
InjJ7WIpsZE,6074480,6081199,survive  after all that is the standard and the  rule by which living things abide make
InjJ7WIpsZE,6081199,6088080,it another day but i believe you are  more than a living thing
InjJ7WIpsZE,6088080,6094560,the god-like ability to not just exist  in a world but create new ones is a
InjJ7WIpsZE,6094560,6099679,miracle  both a blessing and a responsibility
InjJ7WIpsZE,6099679,6105760,to drive towards a more fulfilled you  a happier you a healthier you a more
InjJ7WIpsZE,6105760,6111360,complete you  but one must first become aware that
InjJ7WIpsZE,6111360,6118840,around them exists the pieces required  to build something never before
InjJ7WIpsZE,6118840,6125360,seen the vehicle to those far off places  that were once only dreams thought
InjJ7WIpsZE,6125360,6130400,illusions  i've always believed that if it means
InjJ7WIpsZE,6130400,6135840,something to you it's not stupid it  warrants exploration  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,6135840,6143280,for even if the thought doesn't end up  being all it was cracked up to be  even if it's not the destination
InjJ7WIpsZE,6143280,6149600,but only a stop along the way  it still pushes you to the next thing
InjJ7WIpsZE,6149600,6154639,and the next thing and the next thing it  still moves you forward in this
InjJ7WIpsZE,6154639,6161840,beautiful game of life  [Music]  so decide
InjJ7WIpsZE,6161840,6167040,decide to make today amazing  choose to make it better let the
InjJ7WIpsZE,6167040,6173520,obstacles lift you up and the momentum  carry you towards something meaningful
InjJ7WIpsZE,6173520,6180080,when others stop and find reasons to  doubt themselves  how about you find this small wind
InjJ7WIpsZE,6180080,6186480,buried tucked away underneath it all  the little key that may do nothing more
InjJ7WIpsZE,6186480,6192000,than get you through that next door  after all sometimes that's what life's
InjJ7WIpsZE,6192000,6198239,about  picking up your head when it's most  difficult and finding the next door to
InjJ7WIpsZE,6198239,6204400,walk through and the magic is knowing  you can always do that  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,6204400,6210000,because there always exists  both the doorway and the key but we must
InjJ7WIpsZE,6210000,6216560,be willing to find it that's the obvious  thing about those doors the right ones  will open
InjJ7WIpsZE,6216560,6225040,but they require we find the strength to  approach them  they require that we seek out amazing
InjJ7WIpsZE,6225040,6231360,and so with this in mind  what is the next chapter like for you
InjJ7WIpsZE,6231360,6237199,are you currently enduring one of life's  winters  are you navigating those inevitable
InjJ7WIpsZE,6237199,6245840,valleys of despair  in which the value is in finding that  single ray of light amidst the storm
InjJ7WIpsZE,6245840,6251119,within yourself for the courage to take  one more step forward and another and
InjJ7WIpsZE,6251119,6257199,another are you seeking out that spark  that will reignite the fire in you
InjJ7WIpsZE,6257199,6262320,because it's there  so long as you choose to make today
InjJ7WIpsZE,6262320,6268880,amazing  maybe you've climbed yourself out  maybe you're looking for whatever's next
InjJ7WIpsZE,6268880,6274560,the new evolution  seeking to follow your heart
InjJ7WIpsZE,6274560,6279600,and continue the beautiful progression  that is life
InjJ7WIpsZE,6279600,6285360,let the external world support that  vision choose to see the detail not as
InjJ7WIpsZE,6285360,6290719,trivial but as the answers  the tools that will lift you up and
InjJ7WIpsZE,6290719,6297119,support what you are building  it's there  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,6297119,6303840,she had a picture framed on the table  that said make today amazing
InjJ7WIpsZE,6303840,6311679,place there to remind her how much of  life is a choice  [Music]  because in a world of option
InjJ7WIpsZE,6311679,6319280,what a gift  to choose the journey of a lifetime  what a ride that awaits
InjJ7WIpsZE,6319280,6324920,so long as you decide  to step in
InjJ7WIpsZE,6326950,6332400,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,6332400,6338880,there's a quote attributed to lincoln he  says be sure to put your feet in the  right place
InjJ7WIpsZE,6338880,6345280,then stand firm  the other day i was listening to dan
InjJ7WIpsZE,6345280,6350719,carlin's podcast called hardcore history  which side note is
InjJ7WIpsZE,6350719,6358480,an incredible podcast guy's a brilliant  storyteller and as i was listening  um there's a specific idea that i wanted
InjJ7WIpsZE,6358480,6364239,to dive into an idea that i believe  if we make an effort to understand and
InjJ7WIpsZE,6364239,6370320,fully commit to  is capable of changing our lives
InjJ7WIpsZE,6370400,6375920,but first some quick context right so  dan starts off this episode called king
InjJ7WIpsZE,6375920,6383199,of kings  talking about the battle of thermopylae  in the year 480 bc in ancient greece
InjJ7WIpsZE,6383199,6388719,it's that famous story that a lot of us  know where king leonidas leads that  small army
InjJ7WIpsZE,6388719,6394719,uh which includes 300 spartans against  this massive persian military force
InjJ7WIpsZE,6394719,6402000,that's invading  and the quick version is essentially  xerxes who's the king of the persian
InjJ7WIpsZE,6402000,6408960,empire and in charge of that massive  army  tells the much smaller spartan force
InjJ7WIpsZE,6408960,6416239,that if they lay down their weapons  if they submit to him and let you know
InjJ7WIpsZE,6416239,6423280,the persians pass no harm will be  inflicted upon them they'll be free to  go go about their lives
InjJ7WIpsZE,6423280,6429840,and here's the famous line  in response to the persian command to  lay down their weapons
InjJ7WIpsZE,6429840,6435040,the spartans respond  milan labay
InjJ7WIpsZE,6435040,6442239,which means  come and take them  it's a spartan's way of saying look the
InjJ7WIpsZE,6442239,6447520,only way we're laying these weapons down  is if you rip them from our cold dead
InjJ7WIpsZE,6447520,6453119,hands  right with everything on the line the  odds stacked against them the ground
InjJ7WIpsZE,6453119,6458719,beneath them basically shaking from the  march of a far superior fighting force
InjJ7WIpsZE,6458719,6463840,moving directly towards their location  they would not let go
InjJ7WIpsZE,6463840,6469360,of their principles  [Music]  they were fighting for something bigger
InjJ7WIpsZE,6469360,6471840,than them
InjJ7WIpsZE,6475040,6481119,and i couldn't stop thinking about this  idea long after i hit pause on the  episode
InjJ7WIpsZE,6481119,6488320,i guess i was awestruck by the power of  living life with that type of conviction
InjJ7WIpsZE,6488320,6493620,because i know in my soul that's a north  star i should be gravitating towards we  all should
InjJ7WIpsZE,6493620,6500080,[Music]  the strength to be  unrelenting with regard to that which we
InjJ7WIpsZE,6500080,6505199,care about the aforementioned quote from  lincoln about finding the right place
InjJ7WIpsZE,6505199,6510639,for our feet and then holding steady  with everything you have all that you
InjJ7WIpsZE,6510639,6517119,are  holding firm  i just couldn't get that out of my head
InjJ7WIpsZE,6517119,6522400,and then it came to me that that  invading force
InjJ7WIpsZE,6522400,6529440,represents so much in our personal lives  so many things
InjJ7WIpsZE,6529520,6537920,one example  being the difficult or adverse  circumstances are trying times
InjJ7WIpsZE,6537920,6544080,when you're most likely to concede that  perhaps you're no bigger than that world  around you
InjJ7WIpsZE,6544080,6549520,maybe life is a movie and  i'm merely the audience
InjJ7WIpsZE,6549520,6556719,my job is to clap laugh gasp or cry a my  cog in a wheel a line in a script
InjJ7WIpsZE,6556719,6562560,powerless  in which case
InjJ7WIpsZE,6562560,6569360,you should be reminded of victor  frankl's famous  observation that everything can be taken
InjJ7WIpsZE,6569360,6574719,from a man but one thing the last of the  human freedoms to choose one's attitude
InjJ7WIpsZE,6574719,6581679,in any given set of circumstances to  choose one's own way
InjJ7WIpsZE,6581840,6586960,in other words  the outside world may change
InjJ7WIpsZE,6586960,6594000,it may evolve  but it will never have power over how  you choose to internalize
InjJ7WIpsZE,6594000,6599360,and view what's happening  that's innately yours
InjJ7WIpsZE,6599360,6606560,so when the circumstances feel like they  demand more than you can give when they  suggest you leave your interpretation of
InjJ7WIpsZE,6606560,6613360,life behind  the correct response is as the spartans  defiantly said
InjJ7WIpsZE,6613360,6620159,come and take it  that army could represent a pushback
InjJ7WIpsZE,6620159,6626080,against your values the pillars of your  individual foundation that you feel
InjJ7WIpsZE,6626080,6633199,amidst all the pressure  tempted to let go of  after all it's easier to retreat than
InjJ7WIpsZE,6633199,6639280,stand toe to toe with others  it's easier to abandon than it is to  defend
InjJ7WIpsZE,6639280,6645199,at least in the short term  but as victor hugo writes
InjJ7WIpsZE,6645199,6650560,you have enemies  good  that means you've stood up for something
InjJ7WIpsZE,6650560,6657040,sometime in your life  the enemies obviously not being the
InjJ7WIpsZE,6657040,6663440,point  i'm a believer in the conservation of  enemy approach to life allies just
InjJ7WIpsZE,6663440,6669199,pragmatically get you a lot further but  here's the reality  anyone who stands for something will
InjJ7WIpsZE,6669199,6675119,undoubtedly create  divide they'll be criticized and  condemned
InjJ7WIpsZE,6675119,6681520,and when one feels the pressure of that  criticism  they must understand that it does not
InjJ7WIpsZE,6681520,6686960,invalidate who they are  or their worldview that is yours you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,6686960,6693520,the only one who can give up  or relinquish that control
InjJ7WIpsZE,6693520,6699040,so as the spartans said  come and take it
InjJ7WIpsZE,6701040,6706480,and then lastly  my thoughts went to little things that  make us who we are
InjJ7WIpsZE,6706480,6711679,those tiny pieces of ourselves that we  little by little one by one over time
InjJ7WIpsZE,6711679,6718560,give away  the concessions that fade into the  background as we evolve to fit in so
InjJ7WIpsZE,6718560,6723760,that we don't stand out  emerson beautifully put it
InjJ7WIpsZE,6723760,6731679,to be yourself in a world that is  constantly trying to make you something  else is the greatest accomplishment
InjJ7WIpsZE,6731679,6737199,and so that attacking army  just might be the universe attempting to
InjJ7WIpsZE,6737199,6743920,mold you to it perhaps not all at once  but more like that frog placed in water
InjJ7WIpsZE,6743920,6749280,and put on the stove  with the heat increasing so slowly over
InjJ7WIpsZE,6749280,6756400,time that he doesn't realize that he  will soon overtake him  externalities do not dictate
InjJ7WIpsZE,6756400,6762159,they are objects in need of meaning and  you are the architect here
InjJ7WIpsZE,6762159,6767599,if it means something to you it's worth  holding on to during the difficult times
InjJ7WIpsZE,6767599,6772790,and the easy time  when it's popular  and when it's not
InjJ7WIpsZE,6772790,6780400,[Music]  there is value within you specific to  you a value that must be nurtured in
InjJ7WIpsZE,6780400,6785599,order to expand  others can't and won't see that the
InjJ7WIpsZE,6785599,6790639,world around you may even with all its  complexities seek to suppress it but
InjJ7WIpsZE,6790639,6796560,that flame is there it's there and it's  yours and to anyone or anything looking
InjJ7WIpsZE,6796560,6802480,to extinguish its light  come and take it
InjJ7WIpsZE,6804960,6811360,after all  what is a life if not one lived on your  own terms
InjJ7WIpsZE,6811360,6818159,the goal is not to simply exist but to  define the plane on which you'll evolve
InjJ7WIpsZE,6818159,6824239,to devise your own parameters  be yourself as that world looks to make
InjJ7WIpsZE,6824239,6829520,you something else  so here's to digging deep
InjJ7WIpsZE,6829520,6836480,to finding within yourself the courage  to stand up to the great armies of chaos
InjJ7WIpsZE,6836480,6842239,conflict adversity and their perpetual  conquest
InjJ7WIpsZE,6842239,6848639,to remember how strong you are  how much control you have as you
InjJ7WIpsZE,6848639,6855599,navigate the unknowns and redefine the  right nows  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,6855599,6861360,don't let your strength be the thing you  give away  don't let your heart be what gets left
InjJ7WIpsZE,6861360,6866960,behind don't let your thoughts  become illusions of what could have been
InjJ7WIpsZE,6866960,6873599,if only you'd held on  and look i'm not saying it's easy
InjJ7WIpsZE,6873599,6878800,in fact i know that the meaningful road  will necessarily be the one that
InjJ7WIpsZE,6878800,6885440,requires the most of us  that makes us question who we are and  where we're going
InjJ7WIpsZE,6885440,6890480,it will ask that when our minds race  with doubt in our knees shake with fear
InjJ7WIpsZE,6890480,6898400,we find a way to stand regardless  to walk to our demons look them square
InjJ7WIpsZE,6898400,6903440,in the eye and proclaim that whatever it  takes we are willing to give
InjJ7WIpsZE,6903440,6909360,that we will fight until there's nothing  left go until we can go no further and
InjJ7WIpsZE,6909360,6914400,hold with conviction all that matters  most
InjJ7WIpsZE,6914400,6920960,so the next time light demands that you  fall back or bow down the next time
InjJ7WIpsZE,6920960,6929199,chaos emerges in the distance and asks  only  that you lay down your arms
InjJ7WIpsZE,6929199,6935520,here's to being strong enough certain  enough courageous enough
InjJ7WIpsZE,6935520,6942020,to say one thing and one thing only  come  and take them
InjJ7WIpsZE,6942020,6955130,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,6959170,6963789,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,6970930,6977920,[Music]  around 2011
InjJ7WIpsZE,6977920,6984880,i hurt my left arm and had to get  surgery  so for a while i was pretty limited
InjJ7WIpsZE,6984880,6991199,as far as what i could do with my upper  body  and that's really when i fell in love  with running
InjJ7WIpsZE,6991199,6999360,i started doing it almost every day  sometimes those long runs outside clear  my mind sort of reset a little bit
InjJ7WIpsZE,6999360,7005679,and sometimes i mix it up hop on the  treadmill and do my favorite workout  which was a pyramid right where you
InjJ7WIpsZE,7005679,7010880,break 10 minutes into four segments four  three two
InjJ7WIpsZE,7010880,7017280,and one  increasing in intensity with each  segment and then you start over
InjJ7WIpsZE,7017280,7023840,and that's where  this whole idea comes from it's it's  this treadmill workout
InjJ7WIpsZE,7023840,7030159,that i want to talk about because  there's a little  ritual  i picked up that i still implement to
InjJ7WIpsZE,7030159,7035840,this day and it was simple  at the very end of my workout or my run
InjJ7WIpsZE,7035840,7041760,i would always add 22 seconds  my lucky number twice two and two so for  example
InjJ7WIpsZE,7041760,7047840,if i told myself you know the workout's  going to be  uh you know three pyramids or 30 minutes
InjJ7WIpsZE,7047840,7054880,i would stop running at 30 minutes and  22 seconds and if i told myself it was  gonna be an hour i'd stop at one hour in
InjJ7WIpsZE,7054880,7060320,22 seconds always tacking on that 22 and  i don't really remember the first time i
InjJ7WIpsZE,7060320,7065599,started doing it or even why  but like so many things that 22 second
InjJ7WIpsZE,7065599,7070960,period organically became a habit  sort of evolved to take on a life of its
InjJ7WIpsZE,7070960,7077440,own and would come to symbolize for me  a little challenge the idea that the end
InjJ7WIpsZE,7077440,7084560,is never really the end  and no matter how tired i was or how bad  i wanted to stop especially when you can
InjJ7WIpsZE,7084560,7091360,see that finish line in reach  i could always squeeze out a little more
InjJ7WIpsZE,7091360,7096480,like there's always something extra to  give
InjJ7WIpsZE,7096480,7102560,and you could certainly go down that 22  second rabbit hole right just 22 more  seconds and then you finish that and you
InjJ7WIpsZE,7102560,7108000,realize you can do just 22 more and just  22 more it's like this never ending
InjJ7WIpsZE,7108000,7113679,spotlight  into how incredible we are as humans
InjJ7WIpsZE,7113679,7119119,our stopping points almost always are  constructed
InjJ7WIpsZE,7119119,7127020,rarely is there not an extra 22 seconds  or 22 somethings  we can endure
InjJ7WIpsZE,7127020,7133920,[Music]  and not only that  i think there's a case to be made
InjJ7WIpsZE,7133920,7140400,that our growth occurs in that final  push there's a ton of value
InjJ7WIpsZE,7140400,7146000,uh you know hidden away in there  the the stretching of the mind and body
InjJ7WIpsZE,7146000,7151679,the last rep that breaks down the muscle  the last few seconds of that run that
InjJ7WIpsZE,7151679,7158239,forced the lungs to work their hardest  exhausting that last bit of energy and
InjJ7WIpsZE,7158239,7164560,focus you know studying for an exam  maybe that's where you confirm your  comprehension and understanding of the
InjJ7WIpsZE,7164560,7172800,subject matter it's like  when we are pushing ourselves  just outside the limits we drew up
InjJ7WIpsZE,7172800,7177950,we are  simultaneously expanding  those limits
InjJ7WIpsZE,7177950,7186880,[Music]  and so over the years  i've adopted that mentality
InjJ7WIpsZE,7186880,7193119,and i look at myself in the mirror now  and i can see it i'm not the same person  i was a decade ago
InjJ7WIpsZE,7193119,7199040,those little decisions to add on 22  seconds  they stack up and they stack up in a
InjJ7WIpsZE,7199040,7205199,unique way  because it's not necessarily about the  time
InjJ7WIpsZE,7205199,7210320,it's not the same benefit that say an  hour every morning at the gym would  bring
InjJ7WIpsZE,7210320,7217599,you know obviously that would be  incredibly valuable but in a different  way i'm talking about  mentally an armor that we come to wear
InjJ7WIpsZE,7217599,7224159,an identity that gets materialized it's  how you see yourself and how you see the
InjJ7WIpsZE,7224159,7231599,world  you understand how manufactured our  parameters are
InjJ7WIpsZE,7231599,7236400,and i get it we have to stop somewhere  sure
InjJ7WIpsZE,7237040,7242800,but it's an acknowledgment  that those somewheres are fiction they
InjJ7WIpsZE,7242800,7250239,are arbitrary you weren't made to exist  within them but to stretch them to
InjJ7WIpsZE,7250239,7256639,recreate them  [Music]  and that's an endeavor that is always
InjJ7WIpsZE,7256639,7262080,uncomfortable  but as far as i can tell always worth it
InjJ7WIpsZE,7262080,7269119,the strength to go a little bit further  than initially intended or designed
InjJ7WIpsZE,7269119,7275280,is what will place you in a league of  your own  and that's where i wanted to start
InjJ7WIpsZE,7275280,7280639,by bringing attention to the idea that  there's always an extra 22 seconds
InjJ7WIpsZE,7280639,7286960,and you are always capable of obtaining  it  that is yours
InjJ7WIpsZE,7286960,7294158,whether you choose to see it or not it's  an option it's always an option
InjJ7WIpsZE,7295599,7300800,which sort of connects us  to my next thought  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,7300800,7308080,if i know  that's who i am  someone that fights for that 22 seconds
InjJ7WIpsZE,7308080,7314000,if i know that's what i'm capable of  and that's what lights me up
InjJ7WIpsZE,7314000,7321678,what about those times in my life when i  had no desire  to reach for the extra 22.
InjJ7WIpsZE,7321920,7328159,because sitting here i can think of  plenty i can think of times when there  was dissonance between my identity
InjJ7WIpsZE,7328159,7336239,and my actions  here's a quick story right this was a
InjJ7WIpsZE,7336239,7343760,a shift in in my life and my  understanding  of reaching for that little bit more
InjJ7WIpsZE,7343760,7349119,right when people ask me  uh about my process right what i'm
InjJ7WIpsZE,7349119,7355840,building or where i see myself in x  number of years  i tell them i'm playing the long game
InjJ7WIpsZE,7355840,7361840,right like i'll sacrifice some  short-term wins now  to continue forward with a plan that i
InjJ7WIpsZE,7361840,7367599,believe wholeheartedly  will  transform from linear to exponential
InjJ7WIpsZE,7367599,7374639,right it's like garyvee's motto uh you  know you're young you have time and  impact is not about succeeding
InjJ7WIpsZE,7374639,7383599,at 34 it's about flourishing at 45 and  55 and 65 and 75 like that's fun to me
InjJ7WIpsZE,7383599,7390159,that's the exciting game to play  and it's methodical  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,7390159,7396480,the challenge is  you know as you're locked into this big  picture plan you have to pass a lot of
InjJ7WIpsZE,7396480,7402880,shiny objects along the way  a lot of hey look at them over there  maybe i should be doing that too that
InjJ7WIpsZE,7402880,7410159,worked for her will it work for me right  sometimes you forget to trust yourself  and stay the course
InjJ7WIpsZE,7410159,7416719,and so a few years ago  i felt this pressure to pivot  to adjust focus
InjJ7WIpsZE,7416719,7423040,and i'd been you know talking  with some mentors of mine who were you  know very successful in their individual
InjJ7WIpsZE,7423040,7430239,fields and passions  um and i thought hey you know what it's  time for me  to start focusing less on the craft and
InjJ7WIpsZE,7430239,7436400,more on monetizing the craft  right the dinero side of things which is  great and it's healthy but here's the
InjJ7WIpsZE,7436400,7444800,catch  as long as you're doing it in a way that  aligns  with who you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,7444800,7451599,and so a few months go by and i found  myself living in this overly sized and  priced condo on the beach that i was
InjJ7WIpsZE,7451599,7457199,going to use to impress clients  you know making products that didn't  excite me
InjJ7WIpsZE,7457199,7463280,talking to people i didn't really want  to be talking to living a life that was  not my own
InjJ7WIpsZE,7463280,7470480,i'd lost myself  right my love is storytelling it's  capturing life's seemingly overlooked
InjJ7WIpsZE,7470480,7475599,secrets  that's what i get excited about in the  morning that's the value i want to share
InjJ7WIpsZE,7475599,7481280,with the world  and look money is important it's
InjJ7WIpsZE,7481280,7489040,necessary it's freedom  but for me  it can't be about the money or i lose
InjJ7WIpsZE,7489040,7494079,the drive  right and here's here's the point i'm  making where it all comes together what
InjJ7WIpsZE,7494079,7500480,i've found  is that when you're a stranger in your  own body there's almost no incentive to
InjJ7WIpsZE,7500480,7507040,push for that little extra it's like who  cares about fighting for 22 seconds i'm
InjJ7WIpsZE,7507040,7512880,so misaligned i don't even want to be  here  right that is the red flag that's the
InjJ7WIpsZE,7512880,7519520,indicator that it's time to adjust  because if i'm someone who wants more
InjJ7WIpsZE,7519520,7527920,who pursues and acquires more  and i don't feel the urge to do so
InjJ7WIpsZE,7527920,7533599,you know it's time to change and and i  broke the lease put everything i had in  a car went on a little three-month
InjJ7WIpsZE,7533599,7539520,excursion realigned  and if i'm not willing to suffer through  that little extra to go above and beyond
InjJ7WIpsZE,7539520,7545119,it's not for me and so that's a big  example  but it obviously manifests in smaller
InjJ7WIpsZE,7545119,7551280,ways as well  yes you are someone who can and will
InjJ7WIpsZE,7551280,7558079,chase down the beauty in life who will  transform that little extra into  something meaningful but you also have
InjJ7WIpsZE,7558079,7564560,to position yourself  and the world around you to make it  possible
InjJ7WIpsZE,7564560,7571280,and when you don't feel that hunger  inside  and this is the point you need to  understand it's not
InjJ7WIpsZE,7571280,7576560,you  it's not broken hardware it's not that
InjJ7WIpsZE,7576560,7585440,you innately lack drive or confidence  it's that you need to rearrange this  scenario you need to find alignment
InjJ7WIpsZE,7585440,7593040,because i promise you if you want  something enough you'll be willing to  fight for it to hurt for it to break
InjJ7WIpsZE,7593040,7599119,boundaries for it  but you must first make sure that you're
InjJ7WIpsZE,7599119,7605320,pointed at something you want something  that moves you
InjJ7WIpsZE,7606000,7612880,and here's the part where i remind you  of all those things you've already  overcome in your life
InjJ7WIpsZE,7612880,7619920,of all the times you thought your tank  was empty  but you found a way  all the times you were hurting but kept
InjJ7WIpsZE,7619920,7626159,moving  all the times you were broken but put  yourself back together we are not told
InjJ7WIpsZE,7626159,7633119,in school or at work how resilient we  are  we're not told that we often stop
InjJ7WIpsZE,7633119,7638400,thousands of 22-second periods short  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,7638400,7647280,we aren't told that we're living in a 30  capacity  operating at a fraction of our potential
InjJ7WIpsZE,7647280,7652560,we don't even realize the little  miracles we've created along the way
InjJ7WIpsZE,7652560,7658079,a strong purpose and a willingness to  stretch yourself as you pursue it will
InjJ7WIpsZE,7658079,7665520,change your life and that's not  hyperbole that is fact  if you want what you've never had then
InjJ7WIpsZE,7665520,7671360,push yourself further than you've ever  gone  and we're talking little stressors
InjJ7WIpsZE,7671360,7676960,expanding one step at a time  until you eventually look over your
InjJ7WIpsZE,7676960,7682480,shoulder and see the miles you've  traveled  and so you look at your reflection and
InjJ7WIpsZE,7682480,7689040,see the evolution that has occurred it  was never just 22 seconds
InjJ7WIpsZE,7689040,7695119,it was a consistent and sustained shot  at the walls you placed around yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,7695119,7700360,for the opportunity to see them crumble
InjJ7WIpsZE,7702160,7707740,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,7718960,7725599,plus right out of the gate draw a line  the most important line one can draw a
InjJ7WIpsZE,7725599,7731840,line of demarcation  separating who you were and who you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,7731840,7739199,a line between the past  and the present in this line  marks your return
InjJ7WIpsZE,7739199,7746400,no not to the days of old but to step  one  your chance to begin again
InjJ7WIpsZE,7746400,7751520,to rise above  to transcend yesterday's character and
InjJ7WIpsZE,7751520,7758400,transform today's potential  [Music]  see what we often fail to realize is
InjJ7WIpsZE,7758400,7767440,that there are ideas  deeply ingrained in our minds that rule  over us a sort of subconscious authority
InjJ7WIpsZE,7767440,7774320,it says yesterday you fell short  so today you are someone who falls short
InjJ7WIpsZE,7774320,7782239,it says your objective was not reached  in the past  so how about a new maybe easier one
InjJ7WIpsZE,7782239,7787440,it draws a nice little box pats you on  the head and says how about we make a
InjJ7WIpsZE,7787440,7792960,nice  cozy home for ourselves in here
InjJ7WIpsZE,7793119,7798159,and what this subconscious authority  fears most
InjJ7WIpsZE,7798159,7805040,is that you wake up  that you become aware  that you return
InjJ7WIpsZE,7805040,7810159,not to the past but to the power tucked  away under all the stories
InjJ7WIpsZE,7810159,7815280,you somewhere along the way decided were  real
InjJ7WIpsZE,7815280,7822560,the second you accept that yesterday is  only as relevant as you decided to be
InjJ7WIpsZE,7822560,7828679,you unchain yourself  you become unshackled
InjJ7WIpsZE,7828880,7834000,so return to that place of curiosity  where you're not obligated to perform
InjJ7WIpsZE,7834000,7839760,but gifted with the journey before you  and that could certainly be hard right
InjJ7WIpsZE,7839760,7845599,it was hard for me to look back at my  life and distinguish between what i've  simply accepted
InjJ7WIpsZE,7845599,7850960,and life's objective truths  i'd taken orders and been obedient for
InjJ7WIpsZE,7850960,7856480,so long i'd been listening to that  subconscious authority for so many years
InjJ7WIpsZE,7856480,7862079,that i had to in a way re-learn what  creativity meant for me
InjJ7WIpsZE,7862079,7869520,i had to learn not to feel guilty  going on a jog in the middle of the day  when the rest of the world was working
InjJ7WIpsZE,7869520,7876159,i had to learn that my instinct wasn't  to explore but to stop short  i wasn't pushing limits or peering
InjJ7WIpsZE,7876159,7883840,around corners i wasn't testing the  water or seeking out  the hidden opportunities life hides away
InjJ7WIpsZE,7883840,7889520,no i was on autopilot  and life  it had called for my return it's funny
InjJ7WIpsZE,7889520,7894560,how when you reject your potential long  enough  the universe
InjJ7WIpsZE,7894560,7900960,seems to tap you on the shoulder  it makes it more and more apparent every
InjJ7WIpsZE,7900960,7908159,day  that something greater is within an  arm's reach  backs you into a corner until you have
InjJ7WIpsZE,7908159,7914239,to address the dissonance between who  you are  and who you've allowed yourself to be
InjJ7WIpsZE,7914239,7921360,those orders you've been taking don't  align with your best self  and so one must not only create but in a
InjJ7WIpsZE,7921360,7926880,sense return to their greatness  to accept what they've been running from
InjJ7WIpsZE,7926880,7932560,you are what you choose to be and let's  face it it's very easy to choose
InjJ7WIpsZE,7932560,7938239,to be less than we can be  there's a saying that your reality is
InjJ7WIpsZE,7938239,7943679,not destined to be it is rather what  you've chosen to accept
InjJ7WIpsZE,7943679,7948960,you only get in your life what you allow  and the entirety of this message is
InjJ7WIpsZE,7948960,7955119,about one thing that light bulb moment  the epiphany the instant of empowerment
InjJ7WIpsZE,7955119,7960400,that this world can only give you what  you ask for  and to not ask
InjJ7WIpsZE,7960400,7965920,to sit back and observe makes you a  spectator sitting up in the nosebleeds
InjJ7WIpsZE,7965920,7971040,watching the activity evolve on the  court below it relinquishes
InjJ7WIpsZE,7971040,7977760,control to powers beyond you and that's  existing it's not living
InjJ7WIpsZE,7977760,7986719,so ask  ask life for the things that lift you up  and elevate your existence
InjJ7WIpsZE,7987040,7994639,the reason a book metaphor works so  perfectly in my mind is because when one  opens to a blank sheet they can write
InjJ7WIpsZE,7994639,8000560,about anything there's no limitation to  what can be placed on that paper
InjJ7WIpsZE,8000560,8006239,and sure our proclivity may be to  continue on the legacy of last novel's  cast
InjJ7WIpsZE,8006239,8012560,and characters  but it's by no means required in fact  with that pen in your hand you can craft
InjJ7WIpsZE,8012560,8018719,a new world entirely new places new  things new relationships and ideas
InjJ7WIpsZE,8018719,8025280,new obstacles to face and defeat  a blank page can be and mean anything
InjJ7WIpsZE,8025280,8031280,and so every sunride every door you walk  through presents in the same sense a
InjJ7WIpsZE,8031280,8038000,blank page  realize that there's no obligation to  perpetuate the past or continue on in
InjJ7WIpsZE,8038000,8046400,the same way you arrived no this day is  yours  take hold of that self you've hid away
InjJ7WIpsZE,8046400,8051599,find the courage to unshackle yourself  from how you were once seen by your
InjJ7WIpsZE,8051599,8057440,friends or your teammates or your  co-workers level up  and understand that you don't owe the
InjJ7WIpsZE,8057440,8064480,world any type of explanation  remember you're not here to conform
InjJ7WIpsZE,8064480,8069920,to obey to live a life of obedience  no you're here to poke to pride to
InjJ7WIpsZE,8069920,8076880,explore to follow the nagging curiosity  to embark upon the adventure that is
InjJ7WIpsZE,8076880,8083199,life  when you understand that you are not  your past  when you see
InjJ7WIpsZE,8083199,8089760,that the person you were has no control  over the person you are in this moment
InjJ7WIpsZE,8089760,8096000,you are  free  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,8096000,8101760,so with eyes wide  a beating heart a head held high
InjJ7WIpsZE,8101760,8107520,step into that world  because if you live with conviction with
InjJ7WIpsZE,8107520,8115679,absolute certainty  that life may not always be easy or  intuitive but it's there for you
InjJ7WIpsZE,8115679,8121840,when you see not yesterday's constraints  but tomorrow's hope
InjJ7WIpsZE,8121840,8128639,roads lead to an evolved existence it's  not about perfect and it never was
InjJ7WIpsZE,8128639,8136639,it's about understanding that the past  has given you everything you need to  break away from its grasp
InjJ7WIpsZE,8136639,8143440,it has provided the lessons it has  knocked you back pushed you down and  tested your resolve
InjJ7WIpsZE,8143440,8150719,all for this moment  this second the chance to return to the  greatness that has been tucked away for
InjJ7WIpsZE,8150719,8156159,too long  again no miracles no rabbits out of hats
InjJ7WIpsZE,8156159,8161280,just you allowing your greatness to  emerge from this step forward because
InjJ7WIpsZE,8161280,8166800,you can  because you have that ability because  it's who you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,8166800,8173040,so go show the world but most  importantly so yourself you will be
InjJ7WIpsZE,8173040,8178560,amazed  at what's possible for you
InjJ7WIpsZE,8178560,8188400,if you simply allow it to materialize  if you amidst the darkness of days past
InjJ7WIpsZE,8188400,8193440,let yourself light up  the night
InjJ7WIpsZE,8193440,8201929,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,8214399,8222638,you have to see it  before they do  you have to believe it before they will
InjJ7WIpsZE,8222638,8227760,you have to be the architect  of your plans and your goals because no
InjJ7WIpsZE,8227760,8234638,one will build them for you  and that's just it
InjJ7WIpsZE,8234638,8242558,in a world where  victimhood is becoming currency and  blame is becoming the norm
InjJ7WIpsZE,8242558,8250960,we have a choice  create a temporary fleeting escape
InjJ7WIpsZE,8250960,8256398,or create a life  that matters
InjJ7WIpsZE,8258478,8264080,you know how much easier it is to  project out at the world
InjJ7WIpsZE,8264080,8270880,to never have to look in the mirror  and address the things you could be  doing better
InjJ7WIpsZE,8270880,8277518,you know how much easier it is to hate  him or her or them over there
InjJ7WIpsZE,8277518,8285549,to make up stories and scenarios about  how much different life would be if it  wasn't for a b and c holding you back
InjJ7WIpsZE,8285549,8290638,[Music]  i mean short term it's like winning the
InjJ7WIpsZE,8290638,8298000,lottery right you don't have to take any  accountability  you don't have to have tough  conversations with yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,8298000,8304800,you don't have to reflect  on the painful memories or decisions no  you can put your feet up
InjJ7WIpsZE,8304800,8312160,sit back  point at the world  and say look what they made me do if
InjJ7WIpsZE,8312160,8320478,only  [Music]  but here's what's not being said
InjJ7WIpsZE,8321439,8327760,every time you point your finger away  from your own chest
InjJ7WIpsZE,8327760,8334960,every time you project blame  you're letting yourself down
InjJ7WIpsZE,8335439,8341399,why because we only grow when we take  accountability
InjJ7WIpsZE,8341920,8347840,yeah accountability can be painful  uncomfortable
InjJ7WIpsZE,8349200,8355200,but in that discomfort exists the only  bridge to a better tomorrow
InjJ7WIpsZE,8355200,8361280,that's it  right you go to the gym
InjJ7WIpsZE,8361280,8366800,you put your muscles through stress you  break them down
InjJ7WIpsZE,8366800,8371760,so that they can be built back up  stronger
InjJ7WIpsZE,8373678,8378960,personal responsibility cannot be the  muscle we refuse to build there's too
InjJ7WIpsZE,8378960,8386160,much at stake it can't be the thing you  avoid  why because it's what injects meaning
InjJ7WIpsZE,8386160,8389840,into our lives
InjJ7WIpsZE,8391439,8396720,i'll never forget in the eighth grade  and i bet every single person in that  class
InjJ7WIpsZE,8396720,8402240,uh still to this day remembers  my teacher mr bettencourt walking up to
InjJ7WIpsZE,8402240,8409920,the front of the classroom  he had his hands in a bowl shape and was  holding it up to the ceiling
InjJ7WIpsZE,8410240,8418720,explaining to us that you can't go  through life  asking the world to give you its scraps
InjJ7WIpsZE,8418960,8428319,that if you sit  and you wait  and you hope and you blame you will lose
InjJ7WIpsZE,8428640,8433760,that's the recipe for bitterness  and resentment
InjJ7WIpsZE,8433760,8438800,[Music]  think of it like a fork in the road
InjJ7WIpsZE,8438800,8446640,where two options are vastly different  you go left at the fork  and you enter a world of escapism
InjJ7WIpsZE,8446640,8452960,refusing to confront your problems  finding reasons you can't do that which
InjJ7WIpsZE,8452960,8458319,you know you need to do  hating others those who have built grown
InjJ7WIpsZE,8458319,8464399,or created themselves  [Music]  or
InjJ7WIpsZE,8464399,8470080,you go right at the fork you learn to do  the hard thing to humble yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,8470080,8475359,to take control of your life and your  world  when things aren't the way you want them
InjJ7WIpsZE,8475359,8482160,to be you look around and you  immediately ask  things outside of my control may have
InjJ7WIpsZE,8482160,8488318,brought me here but what can i do  to fix it
InjJ7WIpsZE,8491359,8497920,those of you who have been listening to  me for a while  you probably know my favorite  articulation of this idea was explained
InjJ7WIpsZE,8497920,8506479,by will smith  basically he said  look you can't control where you start
InjJ7WIpsZE,8506720,8512479,and how true that is right life's not  fair  some people are born into more resources
InjJ7WIpsZE,8512479,8518240,and opportunity  some people find themselves in social  situations that aren't ideal and that
InjJ7WIpsZE,8518240,8525040,list can go on and on and on right human  beings are all different so there will  always be discrepancy
InjJ7WIpsZE,8525040,8530720,but and this is will smith's point  where you go from here
InjJ7WIpsZE,8530720,8538080,will always be your responsibility what  happens next is all you
InjJ7WIpsZE,8540240,8546399,you choose whether to complain shake  your fist at the sky and blame the world
InjJ7WIpsZE,8546399,8553040,around you  or pick the pieces up and move forward
InjJ7WIpsZE,8553200,8558319,and like i said a minute ago  don't be fooled by the temptation to
InjJ7WIpsZE,8558319,8564080,latch on to that fleeting moment of  relief  of running from accountability the only
InjJ7WIpsZE,8564080,8569280,way to win in the long run is to face  your demons
InjJ7WIpsZE,8569280,8575439,it's that whole saying when you're  riding shotgun  you can dispute the route all you want
InjJ7WIpsZE,8575439,8580318,but ultimately it's the driver who's in  control
InjJ7WIpsZE,8580560,8587439,when will you take the wheel in your own  life  ensure the stakes become higher
InjJ7WIpsZE,8587439,8592640,right now it's on you  now you can get lost now you're
InjJ7WIpsZE,8592640,8598720,responsible for the maintenance now if  you don't end up at the right place  or i don't know you're late to a
InjJ7WIpsZE,8598720,8604399,destination it's your fault  [Music]  but now
InjJ7WIpsZE,8604399,8612800,you can also  be the one overseeing the journey now  it's yours and that's power
InjJ7WIpsZE,8612800,8619840,and as our world becomes  more and more one of escapism  it's becoming more prevalent
InjJ7WIpsZE,8619840,8625040,easier to avoid or not fix something but  tweet about it
InjJ7WIpsZE,8625040,8631040,how easy it is to not confront our  problems but rather open instagram  facebook tick tock and mindlessly scroll
InjJ7WIpsZE,8631040,8640000,how easy it is to leave that message  unread  and go about our lives because that's  easier than saying what needs to be said
InjJ7WIpsZE,8640000,8645840,strength is being the one amidst all  this escapism and avoidance to confront
InjJ7WIpsZE,8645840,8650880,what must be confronted  whether it's an interaction with someone  else or that
InjJ7WIpsZE,8650880,8657680,hard conversation with yourself a  personal change that must take place  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,8657680,8662960,life is such a gift it's such an  opportunity
InjJ7WIpsZE,8662960,8669520,but we have to move through it with our  eyes open  we have to see things that matter and
InjJ7WIpsZE,8669520,8678160,gravitate towards truths that will shape  us  [Music]  like mr b said over 20 years ago now we
InjJ7WIpsZE,8678160,8684800,can't  ever  fall into the mentality of holding our  hands up to the sky and asking life to
InjJ7WIpsZE,8684800,8692960,give us anything  we can't only point at ourselves when  things go the way we want them to go
InjJ7WIpsZE,8692960,8698800,no let's be about accountability  empowerment
InjJ7WIpsZE,8698800,8706479,understanding that if i don't like  what's around me the transformation  starts now and it starts with me i
InjJ7WIpsZE,8706479,8712319,wasn't perfect i never will be but i can  learn i can evolve and most importantly
InjJ7WIpsZE,8712319,8719600,i have everything i need to make that  happen  it's all awareness
InjJ7WIpsZE,8719760,8724880,right the the victimhood idea is a wolf  in sheep's clothing and i know that may
InjJ7WIpsZE,8724880,8731040,seem harsh maybe even lacking empathy  but dropping that narrative was truly
InjJ7WIpsZE,8731040,8737920,the best thing i've done in my life and  i know countless others who would say  the same you can't be both a perpetual
InjJ7WIpsZE,8737920,8744399,victim and be in control no  life is tough it knocks us down and at
InjJ7WIpsZE,8744399,8752000,times it brings us to our knees but this  is a reminder that you cannot stay there
InjJ7WIpsZE,8752000,8758560,it's a reminder that those who  contributed to the situation are now  minor detail and background noise it's a
InjJ7WIpsZE,8758560,8765520,reminder that the path forward is about  you  it's about you pushing all that aside
InjJ7WIpsZE,8765520,8770960,and asking yourself what's required to  move in the direction that i most want
InjJ7WIpsZE,8770960,8776479,to go  [Music]  because you are that powerful
InjJ7WIpsZE,8776479,8781600,you are strong enough to make that move  and there will be a point
InjJ7WIpsZE,8781600,8786800,where you look around you and the  circumstances have changed the people
InjJ7WIpsZE,8786800,8791761,are different the environment is  different you're different
InjJ7WIpsZE,8792319,8798399,and you'll smile at yourself knowing  it's not because of what the world  provided
InjJ7WIpsZE,8798399,8804080,it's not because of what anyone gave you  it's not because of what people out  there did
InjJ7WIpsZE,8804080,8809920,or didn't do  no it's because when you were at your  lowest
InjJ7WIpsZE,8809920,8816800,when life was presenting curveball after  curveball when you looked around and  maybe even thought to yourself there's
InjJ7WIpsZE,8816800,8823920,no way forward here  you found a way to get up
InjJ7WIpsZE,8823920,8829399,and create  something  new
InjJ7WIpsZE,8829950,8845400,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,8859680,8864120,if these walls could talk
InjJ7WIpsZE,8865600,8870760,they would remind you of the things that  you sometimes  forget
InjJ7WIpsZE,8870760,8877600,[Music]  yeah those elusive things you tend to
InjJ7WIpsZE,8877600,8883040,walk right by  it's not that you've chosen to ignore
InjJ7WIpsZE,8883040,8889680,them it's that well people are complex  [Music]  and we have a tendency to skip over some
InjJ7WIpsZE,8889680,8898399,important things as we remain fixated on  our problems our perceived inadequacies
InjJ7WIpsZE,8898399,8904479,that finicky negativity bias  the one that states
InjJ7WIpsZE,8904479,8910880,if you went to a restaurant 100 times  had 99 incredible experiences but
InjJ7WIpsZE,8910880,8916640,something went wrong on the 100th  well that restaurant would forever be
InjJ7WIpsZE,8916640,8922560,known to you as the place where things  go wrong we are wired
InjJ7WIpsZE,8922560,8929680,not to see the good but to identify  and avoid the bad
InjJ7WIpsZE,8929680,8934720,and if these walls could talk  they would unveil to you the brilliance
InjJ7WIpsZE,8934720,8940160,that exists  slightly out of frame  they would suggest you look over your
InjJ7WIpsZE,8940160,8947200,shoulder and take a peek at how far  you've come because my friend you've  come a long
InjJ7WIpsZE,8947200,8951120,long  way
InjJ7WIpsZE,8953200,8959920,it's funny how slow progress moves  it's interesting how our lowest moments
InjJ7WIpsZE,8959920,8967120,force us outside of ourselves  push us to step into those shoes we
InjJ7WIpsZE,8967120,8972160,didn't know were sitting in the closet  unworn
InjJ7WIpsZE,8972160,8979760,waiting for the day we'd take on that  new role  waiting on you
InjJ7WIpsZE,8980000,8986561,to see that who you were yesterday is  not correlated to who you can be today
InjJ7WIpsZE,8986960,8993040,and if these walls could talk they'd  fill you in on a very important  statistic
InjJ7WIpsZE,8993200,9000000,they'd tell you that  you've stood face to face  with some of the biggest curveballs life
InjJ7WIpsZE,9000000,9005840,can throw  you took on  struggle and hardship that rocked you to
InjJ7WIpsZE,9005840,9013520,your core and as you stand here now  your success rate through all that
InjJ7WIpsZE,9013520,9020880,comes in at  well 100 percent  you are literally undefeated in your
InjJ7WIpsZE,9020880,9027600,ability to move through adversity and  every time you did  whether you knew it or not you walked
InjJ7WIpsZE,9027600,9036000,into that closet  and put on a new pair of shoes you  became something new
InjJ7WIpsZE,9037439,9042560,sometimes progress is so slow that it  feels like pain and it looks like
InjJ7WIpsZE,9042560,9049040,stagnation but it is anything but  and if these walls could talk they would
InjJ7WIpsZE,9049040,9054080,remind you of that truth  they would beg you to see what you've
InjJ7WIpsZE,9054080,9061120,become  who you are  if these walls could talk
InjJ7WIpsZE,9061120,9066640,they would remind you of life's  ever-changing transformative nature
InjJ7WIpsZE,9066640,9074399,all the times they witnessed you upset  about people and things  coming and going
InjJ7WIpsZE,9074399,9080240,as you tried to hold on to that which  perhaps no longer served
InjJ7WIpsZE,9080240,9085359,wishing you could make permanent those  things that were just meant to be  transitory
InjJ7WIpsZE,9085359,9091520,shooting stars across the sky of your  life  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,9091520,9099280,but something doesn't need to be forever  to be meaningful  and thank god because nothing is forever
InjJ7WIpsZE,9099760,9106240,and as we make our way into that vast  unknown we have a choice we can live in  the shadow
InjJ7WIpsZE,9106240,9112000,of a particular moment in time  or we can cherish the value that those
InjJ7WIpsZE,9112000,9117359,moments offered to us  they gave you just enough to take a new
InjJ7WIpsZE,9117359,9123280,step forward  and sometimes a new step in that  direction that's calling you is the
InjJ7WIpsZE,9123280,9128640,difference between nothing  and everything  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,9128640,9135520,so if these walls could talk they would  tell you to keep your head up  and be thankful for those shooting stars
InjJ7WIpsZE,9135520,9141600,in your life for they made you who you  are  and the path forward would be impossible
InjJ7WIpsZE,9141600,9148160,without them  [Music]  if these walls could talk they would ask
InjJ7WIpsZE,9148160,9153280,you about those times you came home  sat down in your room
InjJ7WIpsZE,9153280,9158880,and wondered how you could ever be  enough  they'd call attention to that seemingly
InjJ7WIpsZE,9158880,9164800,non-stop battle with imposter syndrome  they'd ask when you will feel like
InjJ7WIpsZE,9164800,9173600,you've learned  seen or traveled enough to gain some  semblance of authority in your own life
InjJ7WIpsZE,9173600,9180720,they'd wonder when you'll give yourself  permission to be that  you've come so far
InjJ7WIpsZE,9180720,9187600,endured so much you're not the same  person you were a year ago
InjJ7WIpsZE,9187600,9194000,now if you could just stretch a little  further  if you could just extend a little higher
InjJ7WIpsZE,9194000,9200160,if you could see all the new shoes  you've worn  and the shooting stars you've collected
InjJ7WIpsZE,9200160,9206000,along the way  you would know that you are designed to  overcome
InjJ7WIpsZE,9206000,9211840,external pressures obligations criticism  none of it matters
InjJ7WIpsZE,9211840,9217439,this is between you  and yourself and if these walls could  talk
InjJ7WIpsZE,9217439,9222800,they would ask you when you'll see what  they see  the brilliance
InjJ7WIpsZE,9222800,9230720,the magnitude of your potential  when will you be you
InjJ7WIpsZE,9230720,9237359,marcus aurelius wrote  remember how long you've been putting  this off how many extensions the gods
InjJ7WIpsZE,9237359,9244319,gave you and you didn't use them  there is a limit to the time assigned to  you and if you don't use it to free
InjJ7WIpsZE,9244319,9249520,yourself it will be gone and never  return
InjJ7WIpsZE,9249520,9255439,see today is precious because it is the  only one you get each second unique in
InjJ7WIpsZE,9255439,9262080,its own way a measurement of opportunity  represented by a single tick from the
InjJ7WIpsZE,9262080,9269040,watch you're wearing and if these walls  could talk they would tell you  that they've seen people come and go
InjJ7WIpsZE,9269040,9276399,that you aren't the first and you most  definitely won't be the last  and every single soul that stepped
InjJ7WIpsZE,9276399,9283280,inside wish they'd found that courage a  little sooner  wish they'd looked back a little earlier
InjJ7WIpsZE,9283280,9288800,wish they found the inspiration amidst  the chaos and turbulence of their
InjJ7WIpsZE,9288800,9294960,day-to-day lives  and if these walls could talk they'd  hope that maybe
InjJ7WIpsZE,9294960,9300800,this would be it for you the next step  in your evolution
InjJ7WIpsZE,9300800,9308479,and what's most incredible  is that you get there not by becoming  something you've not yet become
InjJ7WIpsZE,9308479,9314960,now in this moment  it's about noticing who you already are
InjJ7WIpsZE,9314960,9320720,instead of the one mistake or reason to  shrink into yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,9320720,9327120,how about shining a light on those 99  reasons to expand
InjJ7WIpsZE,9327120,9333840,when it hurts  know that it's hurt worse and you've  persevered when you experience loss
InjJ7WIpsZE,9333840,9338960,know that it's not about what's gone  but what you now have and will keep with
InjJ7WIpsZE,9338960,9344960,you forever and most importantly know  that you can always step into a new pair
InjJ7WIpsZE,9344960,9351280,of shoes  you can always reinvent  recreate you are never defined by
InjJ7WIpsZE,9351280,9358080,something that happened in the past  the wake of the boat does not drive the
InjJ7WIpsZE,9358080,9365040,boat and so with this in mind chart your  course to new horizons
InjJ7WIpsZE,9365040,9370479,understand that the map you need has  nothing to do with externalities
InjJ7WIpsZE,9370479,9375520,but rather the solutions that already  exist within you
InjJ7WIpsZE,9375520,9382080,so take a second and peer back over your  shoulder  look at that you in the past standing at
InjJ7WIpsZE,9382080,9390000,the bank of a river  hoping praying for help a lift for some  technology to get you across
InjJ7WIpsZE,9390000,9397359,knowing as you stand here now that you  have traversed  oceans look the context changes and yes
InjJ7WIpsZE,9397359,9402399,it will always change but your ability  to endure
InjJ7WIpsZE,9402399,9409920,it does only one thing it multiplies  you have everything you need because you
InjJ7WIpsZE,9409920,9415520,couldn't have gotten to this point  without accumulating the knowledge and
InjJ7WIpsZE,9415520,9421280,expertise to take one step forward and  miracles
InjJ7WIpsZE,9421280,9426560,they are merely the culmination of those  courageous steps
InjJ7WIpsZE,9426560,9433760,and yes when we are stuck  when we're at that coastline looking out  at foreign horizons
InjJ7WIpsZE,9433760,9440640,i get that the answers seem big  sometimes even bigger than we are
InjJ7WIpsZE,9440640,9445760,i get that the mind wanders right to the  potential disasters to the what ifs in
InjJ7WIpsZE,9445760,9453120,the worst case  but if these walls could talk they would  let you know that you've come this far
InjJ7WIpsZE,9453120,9458880,endured and accomplished all this  not because you've left mountains or
InjJ7WIpsZE,9458880,9466720,jumped those  but because when you were at your worst  you found it within yourself to carry on
InjJ7WIpsZE,9466720,9473520,the exponential compounding of what has  made you great and what will continue to
InjJ7WIpsZE,9473520,9481120,make you great look if these walls could  talk they'd show you how the  difficulties of years past have become
InjJ7WIpsZE,9481120,9487760,stepping stones  so commonplace so easily solvable that  they no longer even warrant your
InjJ7WIpsZE,9487760,9494080,attention  that by moving forward you have faced  your obstacles taking the value from
InjJ7WIpsZE,9494080,9499120,them and made them obsolete if these  walls could talk
InjJ7WIpsZE,9499120,9505359,they'd remind you that you are not only  ready but made for everything
InjJ7WIpsZE,9505359,9508601,that awaits
InjJ7WIpsZE,9531840,9538560,in a way  our eyes are liars
InjJ7WIpsZE,9539040,9546160,not in what they portray  but in the implication of their  portrayals
InjJ7WIpsZE,9546399,9553358,our eyes highlight to us one thing  surrounds us now
InjJ7WIpsZE,9553680,9561280,we receive a snapshot of the current  moment  and what took me years to understand
InjJ7WIpsZE,9561280,9569200,is that possibility  and hope  live far beyond what surrounds us right
InjJ7WIpsZE,9569200,9576000,now and it's that pursuit of possibility  that saved my life  immersing myself
InjJ7WIpsZE,9576000,9583520,in the  unseen  perhaps we were given the now  not to subserviently
InjJ7WIpsZE,9583520,9591120,accept it  but to transform it  i believe in our own way
InjJ7WIpsZE,9591120,9598479,we're all architects  here's what i found to be tricky though  as i've spent time thinking about this
InjJ7WIpsZE,9598479,9605119,what i believe and i've come to  recognize is that two things can be true  at once
InjJ7WIpsZE,9605200,9610319,first  all we'll technically ever have is the  present
InjJ7WIpsZE,9610319,9618399,as eckhart tolle explains depression is  essentially being lost in the past  anxiety is being fixated on the future
InjJ7WIpsZE,9618399,9625920,and that a healthy life is learning to  cherish the now  but second
InjJ7WIpsZE,9625920,9631120,is the power and control  of being able to point the now at
InjJ7WIpsZE,9631120,9637200,something far beyond what our eyes  convey  it's the magic of knowing that
InjJ7WIpsZE,9637200,9642800,we spend our days navigating a world of  limitation and restraint
InjJ7WIpsZE,9642800,9647840,and it's not that we wake up and think  you know i'm gonna restrict myself today
InjJ7WIpsZE,9647840,9654720,i'm going to not live up to my full  potential  no it's that we go on autopilot
InjJ7WIpsZE,9654720,9660080,we observe this slide show our eyes play  for us day in and day out
InjJ7WIpsZE,9660080,9665439,and exist within those parameters that  seems perfectly reasonable
InjJ7WIpsZE,9665439,9670720,our eyes show us a wall and our brain  says okay this is where we stop
InjJ7WIpsZE,9670720,9677279,the end  and what i want to highlight
InjJ7WIpsZE,9677279,9684080,is that world  just beyond what our eyes show
InjJ7WIpsZE,9684080,9689439,a world that pushes things a little bit  a world in which we ask okay but what if
InjJ7WIpsZE,9689439,9696399,i gave a little more  or why can't i be like those people in  my life i look up to
InjJ7WIpsZE,9696399,9702880,why shouldn't i change the circumstances  that weigh on my mind  why have i accepted these things that
InjJ7WIpsZE,9702880,9709600,make me unhappy day in and day out  just because it's the image your eyes
InjJ7WIpsZE,9709600,9715359,show you right now  doesn't mean it's where you stop
InjJ7WIpsZE,9716080,9720800,but we have to learn to look for more
InjJ7WIpsZE,9721200,9726560,when i was pretty young like right about  the time home pcs were gaining  prominence
InjJ7WIpsZE,9726560,9732800,my parents got this gateway computer  that came with a star wars game demo
InjJ7WIpsZE,9732800,9738720,and you kind of you have this character  you wander around the spaceship and you  know i played it and i played it and i
InjJ7WIpsZE,9738720,9744160,played it and after a while  i explored all there was to explore
InjJ7WIpsZE,9744160,9750960,right or so i thought i assumed that  maxed the thing out because it was a  demo it wasn't the full game
InjJ7WIpsZE,9750960,9757359,so my assumption was that it wouldn't  let me do too much until i went out and  bought the real version
InjJ7WIpsZE,9757359,9764479,then one day my friend from up the  street came over and i'm showing him the  game  and somewhere he notices a little button
InjJ7WIpsZE,9764479,9769520,that opens up this door and come to find  out  there was actually a lot of real estate
InjJ7WIpsZE,9769520,9774560,left to explore a lot of game uh  available it led to a tunnel that led
InjJ7WIpsZE,9774560,9779920,somewhere else that led somewhere else  and sure i felt like a clown for not  realizing that i was needlessly
InjJ7WIpsZE,9779920,9786479,wandering in circles  but at the same time was  excited about this new world
InjJ7WIpsZE,9786479,9793840,there's something about that concept the  secret door the bookcase that can be  moved to unveil a passageway to
InjJ7WIpsZE,9793840,9801800,something greater to the value locked  away and invisible to the untrained eye
InjJ7WIpsZE,9802000,9807920,of the most important things for us to  understand  is how many of these doors exist in our  lives
InjJ7WIpsZE,9807920,9814240,that if we choose to recognize and  identify something more something that  excites us and invigorates us
InjJ7WIpsZE,9814240,9819570,we can usually draw a line to it we can  start little by little heading that way
InjJ7WIpsZE,9819570,9826080,[Music]  because within the current moment  slideshow we see all around us
InjJ7WIpsZE,9826080,9831590,exist the little passageways the side  streets the tunnels connecting to  something more
InjJ7WIpsZE,9831590,9837040,[Music]  that of course those gates  won't open up
InjJ7WIpsZE,9837040,9842960,if you've not constructed a destination  in your mind worth traveling to again
InjJ7WIpsZE,9842960,9851600,not because you're insufficient or  inadequate or wrong but because our  default is to live life on demo mode
InjJ7WIpsZE,9851600,9859200,we have to manufacture more  [Music]  build a higher platform
InjJ7WIpsZE,9859200,9867279,and then climb up to it using ropes and  ladders that we already walk by every  day without thinking twice
InjJ7WIpsZE,9867279,9872319,our world our right now  is a toolbox waiting for us to construct
InjJ7WIpsZE,9872319,9877681,a more meaningful peaceful happy  tomorrow
InjJ7WIpsZE,9879600,9885200,and so again i present the question  where are these hidden opportunities or  gateways in your life
InjJ7WIpsZE,9885200,9892160,where can you find the advantages  dressed up as the mundane  is it in a book
InjJ7WIpsZE,9892160,9899040,is it a conversation  is it applying to that thing you've been  hesitant to pursue because you're scared
InjJ7WIpsZE,9899040,9904479,of what might await  is it understanding the power of 10
InjJ7WIpsZE,9904479,9911600,minutes a day  then how starting small opens doors that  we can't even comprehend is it a little
InjJ7WIpsZE,9911600,9916880,boldness  is it looking in the mirror and  realizing you're still shackling
InjJ7WIpsZE,9916880,9922560,yourself to who you were yesterday  is it understanding that someone or
InjJ7WIpsZE,9922560,9927600,something in your life isn't conducive  to your well-being
InjJ7WIpsZE,9927600,9932640,is it an hour in the morning to think  an hour at night to breathe is it
InjJ7WIpsZE,9932640,9938960,changing a self-limiting relationship  with time or money or resources
InjJ7WIpsZE,9939279,9944880,what walls can you knock down so that  you might open up a world that's meant
InjJ7WIpsZE,9944880,9951520,for you a world that's malleable  and without limitation
InjJ7WIpsZE,9951520,9957520,your eyes they don't tell the story of  how things can be or what they mean
InjJ7WIpsZE,9957520,9965040,they show you the infinite tools at your  disposal to build to create to design
InjJ7WIpsZE,9965040,9970479,to never accept a now that wasn't chosen  with intentionality
InjJ7WIpsZE,9970479,9977040,that where there exists pain there also  exists a door to lessen and transform
InjJ7WIpsZE,9977040,9982080,that pain  your journey it never ends where you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,9982080,9987680,it ends where you choose to stop  it ends where you plant a steak in the
InjJ7WIpsZE,9987680,9994399,ground and accept the world around you  so if no one has told you recently let
InjJ7WIpsZE,9994399,10003200,me remind you how powerful you are let  me reiterate what you are capable of
InjJ7WIpsZE,10003200,10008880,and that perhaps your reality requires  of you some customization
InjJ7WIpsZE,10008880,10014880,perhaps the courage to step outside the  routine and the obligation
InjJ7WIpsZE,10014880,10020319,and as the architect you are  build something beautiful meaningful
InjJ7WIpsZE,10020319,10026160,something incredible to stand on  to recognize the distinction between
InjJ7WIpsZE,10026160,10032479,what is and what can be the second  one understands that they are walking by
InjJ7WIpsZE,10032479,10038000,the very solutions they need  that to remain in a state of discontent
InjJ7WIpsZE,10038000,10045520,is simply an indifference to the  resources around them  remember this
InjJ7WIpsZE,10045520,10052880,what you see your eyes don't provide an  end state but a path to the next chapter
InjJ7WIpsZE,10052880,10057920,a chisel to little by little evolve
InjJ7WIpsZE,10057920,10063680,as someone recently reminded me  mark twain's quote logic will get you
InjJ7WIpsZE,10063680,10069600,from point a to point b but imagination  will take you everywhere
InjJ7WIpsZE,10069600,10075040,why because so much exists beyond the  parameters of everyday life
InjJ7WIpsZE,10075040,10083200,it's about mapping new paths with new  points and new rules  because some exist and some live
InjJ7WIpsZE,10083200,10089359,some comply and some create  some see what is around them
InjJ7WIpsZE,10089359,10095359,and some ask what can i build with what  is around me  so built
InjJ7WIpsZE,10095359,10102160,towers that touch the sky bridges that  connect the earth  build like this is a game and the only
InjJ7WIpsZE,10102160,10108800,way to lose  is to stop yourself from experiencing  all it has
InjJ7WIpsZE,10108800,10115279,to offer  build like there's a world
InjJ7WIpsZE,10115279,10121920,far beyond your front door  because if you do that's exactly
InjJ7WIpsZE,10121920,10127879,where you'll find yourself  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,10141040,10147680,sometimes the most important things we  do in our lives are the product of sheer  will
InjJ7WIpsZE,10147680,10155680,of taking little nothings that surround  us  and making something out of them
InjJ7WIpsZE,10155920,10161760,in other words the greatest  opportunities  often the ones we need most
InjJ7WIpsZE,10161760,10168880,they simply aren't obvious they're  hidden  hidden behind what looks like difficulty
InjJ7WIpsZE,10168880,10174420,what appears to be hopelessness  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,10174479,10180560,the reason i place so much value on a  single step forward when we're  overwhelmed
InjJ7WIpsZE,10180560,10185760,or at a low point  is because a single step means you're in
InjJ7WIpsZE,10185760,10193040,the game  you're giving yourself a chance to find  and obtain those little hidden away
InjJ7WIpsZE,10193040,10201279,pieces  that can't be found when we stand still  and dwell on a situation
InjJ7WIpsZE,10202080,10208000,mobility is empowerment  and when we move forward only with what
InjJ7WIpsZE,10208000,10214640,we have we're continuously reminded that  what we have is enough  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,10214640,10222479,we have the tools the resources and the  ability  we just have to somehow remind ourselves
InjJ7WIpsZE,10222479,10228800,that with those tools we are capable of  building  of creating
InjJ7WIpsZE,10228800,10234040,the incredible  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,10234160,10241680,so quick story  about what i believe is the best song  ever written certainly one of them
InjJ7WIpsZE,10241680,10249279,and it's a little bit older now but in  1998 a band called the gugu dolls  released a song called iris
InjJ7WIpsZE,10249279,10256000,and  that song changed my life it was the  first album i bought it introduced me to
InjJ7WIpsZE,10256000,10261279,music i listened to it you know probably  thousands of times and even 24 years  later
InjJ7WIpsZE,10261279,10268560,it gives me chills listening to it  and so i wanted to find out a little  more about the song and i came across an
InjJ7WIpsZE,10268560,10275120,interview from johnny reznik who  is the front man and songwriter for the  band
InjJ7WIpsZE,10275120,10280800,and in this interview  the interviewers asking johnny about the  song
InjJ7WIpsZE,10280800,10286240,[Music]  basic questions how it came out  how he wrote it and stuff like that and
InjJ7WIpsZE,10286240,10294160,there's a few points that i think are  amazing i want to share them with you  first is the state he was in prior to
InjJ7WIpsZE,10294160,10300800,writing the song  he just came out of a divorce personal  life sort of in shambles coming off of a
InjJ7WIpsZE,10300800,10307520,bad record deal where  uh the label from his previous album had  done what record labels are notorious
InjJ7WIpsZE,10307520,10314319,for um and ended up keeping the vast  majority of the revenue  he had writer's block you know just fell
InjJ7WIpsZE,10314319,10319359,down and it left his home to stay at a  hotel in los angeles
InjJ7WIpsZE,10319359,10324720,bottom line is it's not a dream scenario  by any stretch of the imagination and uh
InjJ7WIpsZE,10324720,10332160,then gets a call from his manager about  potentially writing a song for the city  of angel's soundtrack
InjJ7WIpsZE,10332160,10337439,and he says he went and sort of  auditioned  with what he had which was two lines of
InjJ7WIpsZE,10337439,10344319,a song  and a guitar with two broken strings  it was evidently good enough he gets a
InjJ7WIpsZE,10344319,10349520,nod from the label and starts  writing and the verses
InjJ7WIpsZE,10349520,10354640,according to johnny in the interview  they align perfectly with the movie  right it's an angel
InjJ7WIpsZE,10354640,10361120,willing to give up  anything even his immortality to be  human so he could be with this girl
InjJ7WIpsZE,10361120,10366640,right and uh  it's it's this deep dive into
InjJ7WIpsZE,10366640,10371840,you know what it is to love someone so  much you give up everything for them
InjJ7WIpsZE,10371840,10377920,and then and this is the icing on the  cake for me that's when it like i  realized that i wanted to write about
InjJ7WIpsZE,10377920,10383520,this  um  the interviewer says essentially okay
InjJ7WIpsZE,10383520,10390319,johnny the verse is the line with the  movie but the chorus this revolutionary  big beautiful powerful chorus it seems
InjJ7WIpsZE,10390319,10396479,to take a left turn  like can you explain that to us what  were you thinking
InjJ7WIpsZE,10396479,10403359,and he just kind of pauses blankly for a  second  and i'm thinking no don't you dare say
InjJ7WIpsZE,10403359,10410160,what i know you're about to say  and sure enough he does he basically  shrugs and goes i don't know the words
InjJ7WIpsZE,10410160,10417840,just kind of worked  and you know i'm paraphrasing that's not  a direct quote but that's the idea you
InjJ7WIpsZE,10417840,10425359,know one of the deepest most powerful  beautiful songs i've ever heard  is patchwork right even the song title
InjJ7WIpsZE,10425359,10434160,he says was named after a country singer  on the cover of a magazine laying next  to him iris that's patchwork it's pieces
InjJ7WIpsZE,10434160,10440560,put together  right and then as i thought about it for  a minute it's like of course it is
InjJ7WIpsZE,10440560,10446319,how perfect how absolutely perfect the  whole thing is an assembly and
InjJ7WIpsZE,10446319,10453600,construction  a metaphor for the human spirit  conceived when its author was down and
InjJ7WIpsZE,10453600,10461600,out right taking l after l  called to present an idea didn't have  some crazy budget or equipment to pitch
InjJ7WIpsZE,10461600,10467200,this song nope  move forward only with what he had in  the moment
InjJ7WIpsZE,10467200,10472640,and that was enough  then the song a beautiful depiction of
InjJ7WIpsZE,10472640,10479200,uh you know the movie's theme combined  with elements of real life his personal  situation what he goes through maybe
InjJ7WIpsZE,10479200,10484640,even components that mean nothing other  than an ability to encapsulate a feeling
InjJ7WIpsZE,10484640,10491920,or an emotion words that allowed him to  put a bow on all these little pieces  himself and get it out the door
InjJ7WIpsZE,10491920,10497200,and millions and millions of people  listened to that song and were changed  by it
InjJ7WIpsZE,10497200,10503680,not because of what it meant to johnny  but because it gave them a chance
InjJ7WIpsZE,10503680,10509040,to take it and fit their own worlds and  struggles into those same lines it
InjJ7WIpsZE,10509040,10515920,became a vehicle to inspire others to  push forward to find things in  themselves they didn't know were there
InjJ7WIpsZE,10515920,10521680,this has become one of my favorite  metaphors for finding the hero
InjJ7WIpsZE,10521680,10527040,buried deep within yourself  changing your life changing your world
InjJ7WIpsZE,10527040,10532318,changing the world around you the lives  of others
InjJ7WIpsZE,10532960,10540080,can truly be and in fact often is the  result of  just moving forward with what you have
InjJ7WIpsZE,10540080,10545200,right realizing that even when the  mountain seems too tall to climb
InjJ7WIpsZE,10545200,10551520,there is a way  we just require that mental shift
InjJ7WIpsZE,10551520,10560399,listen to this question right because i  used to ask myself all the time is this  possible can this be done
InjJ7WIpsZE,10560800,10565920,well then that becomes the question that  i focused on  and everything that occurred around me
InjJ7WIpsZE,10565920,10571359,became evidence that would either  support or invalidate that possibility
InjJ7WIpsZE,10571359,10578240,the second i came up against an  inevitable barrier i'd think ah maybe  this is telling me the answer is no
InjJ7WIpsZE,10578240,10583680,right life will always be evidence for  or against the questions that you choose
InjJ7WIpsZE,10583680,10591840,to ask  which is why it's so important that  you're asking the right questions
InjJ7WIpsZE,10593120,10599200,because the second  you change that question to look i know  this can be done but how will i do it
InjJ7WIpsZE,10599200,10605279,you start looking at life  as a puzzle that must be solved  that same obstacle that was once
InjJ7WIpsZE,10605279,10610319,interpreted as a stop sign  is now merely an indicator that
InjJ7WIpsZE,10610319,10616640,the path exists just perhaps somewhere  else  you've extended the pursuit you've given
InjJ7WIpsZE,10616640,10622880,yourself permission to keep looking and  it's because of these self-created  expeditions
InjJ7WIpsZE,10622880,10628880,that we find more in ourselves  you know things won't always go
InjJ7WIpsZE,10628880,10635120,perfectly  but when you look at those imperfections  through the right lens
InjJ7WIpsZE,10635120,10643040,you see that this isn't about you  it's about that particular door being  locked all you have to do
InjJ7WIpsZE,10643040,10649840,is believe in yourself enough to move to  the next one to continue knocking until  you find a door that opens
InjJ7WIpsZE,10649840,10656720,until you find that bridge to whatever  comes next  and that's why i love that story about
InjJ7WIpsZE,10656720,10661840,iris why i wanted to share it today  was crafted during times far from ideal
InjJ7WIpsZE,10661840,10667840,with the resources far from abundant  with words  far from perfect or
InjJ7WIpsZE,10667840,10672880,related or self-explanatory  but you end up on the other side with
InjJ7WIpsZE,10672880,10682240,this masterpiece  this song that certainly changed my life  indefinitely impacted many others
InjJ7WIpsZE,10682800,10689760,and it's like we have to realize when  we're sitting on the edge of the bed you  know maybe it's not divorce or writer's
InjJ7WIpsZE,10689760,10695680,block  but whatever it is holding you back  that's not the end
InjJ7WIpsZE,10695680,10700720,it's your reason to keep going to begin  again  you don't have to know how things will
InjJ7WIpsZE,10700720,10706640,be but you do have to know how they  won't be they won't be like this because
InjJ7WIpsZE,10706640,10712960,you won't let them stay this way  and maybe it's not two written lines in
InjJ7WIpsZE,10712960,10719520,a broken guitar  maybe it's moving forward when your  strength is not at a ten out of ten
InjJ7WIpsZE,10719520,10724960,when you don't really have that spark  or you're longing for some resources
InjJ7WIpsZE,10724960,10730479,some finances wondering where they'll  come from  but pushing forward one little step at a
InjJ7WIpsZE,10730479,10737200,time until things start making sense and  maybe it's not a combining and  restructuring of song lyrics
InjJ7WIpsZE,10737200,10744479,using your personal experiences to fill  the gaps on the paper before you
InjJ7WIpsZE,10744479,10750800,but it's trusting that your own story  will ultimately tell itself if you don't  put the pen down
InjJ7WIpsZE,10750800,10757760,that the heroes will rise the villains  will fall and the adventure will  continue on
InjJ7WIpsZE,10757760,10763680,after all that's what life is  one giant adventure testing us pushing
InjJ7WIpsZE,10763680,10771840,us and transforming us when we're at our  lows  while reminding us during the good times
InjJ7WIpsZE,10771840,10777840,why we're lucky to have been gifted that  same adversity  we once looked at with contempt why
InjJ7WIpsZE,10777840,10784960,we're lucky that  when everything's made to be broken as  the lyrics suggest
InjJ7WIpsZE,10784960,10792359,we get to make something imperfectly  beautiful with the pieces
InjJ7WIpsZE,10794940,10802909,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,10804970,10818729,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,10822000,10828319,[Music]  recently i was thinking about something
InjJ7WIpsZE,10828319,10836000,a friend of mine named tom told me a few  years back  he owns a company in oklahoma city
InjJ7WIpsZE,10836000,10842080,and was telling me about how someone  he'd hired essentially stole from him
InjJ7WIpsZE,10842080,10849040,and the first question that came to my  mind as he was telling the story was  okay what are you going to do about it
InjJ7WIpsZE,10849040,10856399,and i asked him the question and he was  kind of quiet for a second and uh then  asked in his southern accent eddie if a
InjJ7WIpsZE,10856399,10862319,snake bites you are you going to chase  it into the woods to get your revenge
InjJ7WIpsZE,10862319,10868560,are you going to get the medical  attention required to save yourself  basically you're going to focus on the
InjJ7WIpsZE,10868560,10875920,past  [Music]  or on what to do from here  forward right basically he cut ties with
InjJ7WIpsZE,10875920,10883520,the person but had moved on  was already thinking about next steps  that were best for him his family and
InjJ7WIpsZE,10883520,10889600,his business  and i can tell you since hearing that  it's become an incredibly valuable idea
InjJ7WIpsZE,10889600,10896399,in my life  [Music]  especially as you realize that there  will never be a shortage of problems
InjJ7WIpsZE,10896399,10904720,you do what you can to avoid them you  try to steer clear when possible but  adversity will always be a factor
InjJ7WIpsZE,10904720,10909840,it's about knowing that and and stepping  into it regardless
InjJ7WIpsZE,10909840,10915680,it's just it's something that's always  intertwined in our development and i  find value
InjJ7WIpsZE,10915680,10923200,in asking myself  is this action i'm about to take  conducive to my growth and my happiness
InjJ7WIpsZE,10923200,10929200,or  am i just chasing snakes  does this just feel good in the short
InjJ7WIpsZE,10929200,10934800,term because i'm angry or i've been  wronged or something along those lines
InjJ7WIpsZE,10934800,10942880,especially since most harm inflicted on  others derived from incompetence not  malice and i truly believe that
InjJ7WIpsZE,10942880,10948160,i think very frequently we attribute  sinister motives to others
InjJ7WIpsZE,10948160,10953840,when 99 of the time it's you know sheer  stupidity it's imperfect humans trying
InjJ7WIpsZE,10953840,10959359,to navigate an often complex world we  make mistakes
InjJ7WIpsZE,10959359,10965439,now i'm not suggesting you don't stand  up for yourself when you've been wronged  or slighted
InjJ7WIpsZE,10965439,10971920,of course you should but the magic is in  not  personalizing the situation
InjJ7WIpsZE,10971920,10977359,right possessing the emotional iq to  understand  hey look it's not about me
InjJ7WIpsZE,10977359,10984720,but whether i can salvage this situation  from here  and that depends solely on how i choose
InjJ7WIpsZE,10984720,10991279,to look at it  emerson wrote people do not seem to
InjJ7WIpsZE,10991279,10996880,realize that their opinion of the world  is also a confession of their character
InjJ7WIpsZE,10996880,11003040,and what a powerful point  the flexibility and the leeway available  to us
InjJ7WIpsZE,11003040,11009359,when it comes to making sense of the  world speaks to  not how the world is but how the
InjJ7WIpsZE,11009359,11015520,onlooker thinks and interprets  depersonalizing the situation is one of
InjJ7WIpsZE,11015520,11021920,the greatest superpowers at our disposal  when you're angry and accusatory you
InjJ7WIpsZE,11021920,11029439,will as tom put it end up chasing snakes  you'll end up breaking things that will  need to be rebuilt and uttering words
InjJ7WIpsZE,11029439,11035279,you'll wish you'd never spoken  but the five seconds required to pause
InjJ7WIpsZE,11035279,11041040,to collect yourself and realize that  you're in control  is everything
InjJ7WIpsZE,11041040,11048560,the ability to see the person the  situation or the world not as an  adversary stacked against you but as an
InjJ7WIpsZE,11048560,11055760,inevitable challenge that must be  managed  so how will you choose to manage it
InjJ7WIpsZE,11055760,11060640,how will you choose to arrange the
InjJ7WIpsZE,11060840,11067279,pieces by the way i'm i'm fully aware  the constant theme for my speeches and
InjJ7WIpsZE,11067279,11072800,podcasts and videos is the act of  pointing not out at the world but in at
InjJ7WIpsZE,11072800,11079520,ourselves my responsibility my fault my  problem to deal with i understand just
InjJ7WIpsZE,11079520,11085200,how  heavy  that is  how hard that can be
InjJ7WIpsZE,11085200,11091840,especially when deflecting blame  often feels like it would just be a  tremendous weight off of our shoulders
InjJ7WIpsZE,11091840,11097920,when revenge feels like the easy  intuitive move
InjJ7WIpsZE,11097920,11105200,but again it's short-term relief to  truly grow  to find the calm and happiness and
InjJ7WIpsZE,11105200,11111920,meaning we long for  it's the internal relationship with  ourselves that matters most
InjJ7WIpsZE,11111920,11118160,it's the ability to say i may not have  created this  or even you know i may have made the
InjJ7WIpsZE,11118160,11126160,mistakes that brought this to life but i  can't fix it  until i look at both the situation and
InjJ7WIpsZE,11126160,11132399,my own reflection  and proclaim it's mine  now
InjJ7WIpsZE,11132399,11138800,let the past be the past  now it's me and the present and as far
InjJ7WIpsZE,11138800,11146240,as i'm concerned  the present and opportunity they are  always one in the same so long as we
InjJ7WIpsZE,11146240,11152479,choose to see it that way  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,11152479,11158560,it's not what you look at it's what you  see  over  and over
InjJ7WIpsZE,11158560,11164800,and over again  is it happening to you  or for you is it a problem or an
InjJ7WIpsZE,11164800,11171680,opportunity a setback or a chance to  reset  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,11171680,11179680,i want to bring to light a story one  that i've told before  but it's so perfectly representative of
InjJ7WIpsZE,11179680,11185200,the conversation  you know jim rohn talking about two  brothers in an abusive household
InjJ7WIpsZE,11185200,11191040,alcoholic father terrible childhoods  you know they grow up
InjJ7WIpsZE,11191040,11197840,and both of the sons  have families of their own  one is the exact same as his father he's
InjJ7WIpsZE,11197840,11203439,abusive and he's angry  and the other one is a great father he's  kind he's loving he's supportive and
InjJ7WIpsZE,11203439,11210319,when asked why  the abusive brother replies look at my  childhood right how could you blame me
InjJ7WIpsZE,11210319,11216720,for this  the other brother when ass responds look  at my childhood right how could i let
InjJ7WIpsZE,11216720,11224000,myself treat my family the same way  and in a way one spent his life chasing
InjJ7WIpsZE,11224000,11229279,snakes bitter resentful  [Music]  the other one asked well that was
InjJ7WIpsZE,11229279,11235680,terrible but what can i do to write the  wrong  one personalized it the other used it as
InjJ7WIpsZE,11235680,11242240,a lever or stepping stone  [Music]  and this is of course a simplification
InjJ7WIpsZE,11242240,11249600,but i believe every struggle we face in  our lives at its core contains  some element of this choice
InjJ7WIpsZE,11249600,11256240,from the little things to the big things  where do i go from here it's mine now
InjJ7WIpsZE,11256240,11262319,and i can choose whether to make it  better or worse  chase the snake into the woods or march
InjJ7WIpsZE,11262319,11267439,forward to find the value and right the  ship
InjJ7WIpsZE,11267439,11273439,remember that  when it's hardest  when you least want to
InjJ7WIpsZE,11273439,11278640,remember that the present contains every  single thing you need to begin a journey
InjJ7WIpsZE,11278640,11283840,to recovery to growth to contentment and  meaning
InjJ7WIpsZE,11283840,11289120,you on your end though  need to be willing to slow down the
InjJ7WIpsZE,11289120,11294800,moment  need to be willing to collect yourself
InjJ7WIpsZE,11294800,11303960,and give yourself permission to take  that  necessary and appropriate step
InjJ7WIpsZE,11305090,11310540,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,11330880,11336000,a life well lived  is a dance
InjJ7WIpsZE,11336000,11343840,between having the strength to walk away  and having the courage to go all in
InjJ7WIpsZE,11343840,11349120,it's juggling the idea that absolutely  nothing matters
InjJ7WIpsZE,11349120,11358720,and the idea that every second is a  blessing beyond which i'm capable of  even explaining or articulating
InjJ7WIpsZE,11359359,11365359,nothing matters  so live without limits or constraints
InjJ7WIpsZE,11365359,11370479,like you're on a once in a lifetime  journey
InjJ7WIpsZE,11370479,11376399,but everything matters  so know that every second along the way
InjJ7WIpsZE,11376399,11383600,is perfect  a building block a microcosm of the  universe resting in the palm of your
InjJ7WIpsZE,11383600,11390239,hand  [Music]  and i think about this push pull from  time to time
InjJ7WIpsZE,11390239,11395279,i play with the idea that nothing  matters when i need courage
InjJ7WIpsZE,11395279,11401279,when i need to convince myself to be a  little bolder  reinforce the understanding that there
InjJ7WIpsZE,11401279,11407439,is no pressure here  life can only give what i'm willing to  carve out
InjJ7WIpsZE,11407439,11412630,and as that clock ticks away in the  background what do i have to lose
InjJ7WIpsZE,11412630,11417680,[Music]  as mark twain put it it's the things we
InjJ7WIpsZE,11417680,11421760,don't do that we come to regret
InjJ7WIpsZE,11422800,11428880,and then on the other side  when i need a little discipline  i play with the idea that the little
InjJ7WIpsZE,11428880,11436080,things are everything  after all two things can be true at once  and the details matter a lot
InjJ7WIpsZE,11436080,11443520,for me getting up two hours earlier does  make a difference that pushing a little  harder will add up
InjJ7WIpsZE,11443520,11449840,the little things  become everything  and painting that portrait that had been
InjJ7WIpsZE,11449840,11455680,tucked away in my imagination  well that's done one very real very
InjJ7WIpsZE,11455680,11462399,tangible brush stroke at a time  it's participating in that dance between
InjJ7WIpsZE,11462399,11467439,nothing and everything the real and the  imaginary
InjJ7WIpsZE,11467439,11473680,but for the time being let's leave those  very important little things
InjJ7WIpsZE,11473680,11478880,and focus  on the divine  big things
InjJ7WIpsZE,11478880,11485040,those nothings  that with some vision and concentrated  effort
InjJ7WIpsZE,11485040,11490640,become some things  i have a friend that says to me all the
InjJ7WIpsZE,11490640,11497680,time  nothing  matters  and not in a nihilistic you know throw
InjJ7WIpsZE,11497680,11503359,your hands up and stay inside until the  end of time type way
InjJ7WIpsZE,11503359,11509040,but in a way that poses the question  why wouldn't you risk it all
InjJ7WIpsZE,11509040,11514319,nothing matters why wouldn't you risk  seeing how far you could push how long
InjJ7WIpsZE,11514319,11521120,you could run how much you could become  [Music]  because maybe
InjJ7WIpsZE,11521120,11527279,just maybe this whole thing isn't as  serious as we'd like to think it is
InjJ7WIpsZE,11527279,11534800,and instead of feeling confined  and scared  what if you felt alive
InjJ7WIpsZE,11534800,11540560,blessed to even be here  and i think realizing that we build
InjJ7WIpsZE,11540560,11546960,these imaginary boxes around ourselves  and live within them is a huge step
InjJ7WIpsZE,11546960,11553840,that awareness that we spend so much  time reaching  out for things that will
InjJ7WIpsZE,11553840,11560080,save us  when in reality we simply need to set  ourselves free
InjJ7WIpsZE,11560080,11565439,we need to open the gates build bridges  to the infinite opportunity
InjJ7WIpsZE,11565439,11571730,that surrounds us  when i think about this a feeling that  still comes to mind
InjJ7WIpsZE,11571730,11578080,[Music]  feeling i had after 2k tests in college
InjJ7WIpsZE,11578080,11584560,those of you that have been on the  rowing machines i'm sure you get it  but if not picture a feeling
InjJ7WIpsZE,11584560,11591680,similar to an all-out sprint for roughly  six or seven minutes depending on when  you cross the line
InjJ7WIpsZE,11591680,11596800,and when it was  over after i finished picking myself up
InjJ7WIpsZE,11596800,11602239,i would just sit in the hallway  cherish the feeling of being done right
InjJ7WIpsZE,11602239,11608000,after pushing my body to its maximum  i'd appreciate the nothingness the same
InjJ7WIpsZE,11608000,11613920,nothingness that i'd never pay attention  to at all otherwise  but in that moment
InjJ7WIpsZE,11613920,11619279,it was everything what a gift  as you regain your composure as your
InjJ7WIpsZE,11619279,11626960,heart rate comes back down to earth  to just be still  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,11626960,11632560,i still love that feeling after physical  exertion the reminder to just be
InjJ7WIpsZE,11632560,11640319,thankful for a moment of serenity a  reminder that life can and will inflict  upon us these periods of absolute chaos
InjJ7WIpsZE,11640319,11645439,of turbulence  and often they're very necessary they
InjJ7WIpsZE,11645439,11650960,harden us they shape us but they also  remind us to appreciate their absence
InjJ7WIpsZE,11650960,11657520,the same thing goes and a lot of you i'm  sure we'll be able to relate to this for  something like a headache or a migraine
InjJ7WIpsZE,11657520,11663520,you know when they come and go in my  life it's like the second a brutal  headache dissipates
InjJ7WIpsZE,11663520,11671120,that nothingness is the greatest gift i  could ever imagine the absence of pain
InjJ7WIpsZE,11671120,11678479,infinitely more valuable than any  tangible acquisition  and i think in those moments
InjJ7WIpsZE,11678479,11684319,we get a glimpse of the world in its  purest  simplest form
InjJ7WIpsZE,11684319,11690319,where all the nuance and detail we worry  about doesn't matter much
InjJ7WIpsZE,11690319,11696640,because look at what we have  look how much surrounds us when we  position ourselves to notice when we
InjJ7WIpsZE,11696640,11702800,simply pay  attention  tolstoy said
InjJ7WIpsZE,11702800,11709520,if then i were asked for the most  important advice i could give  that which i consider to be the most
InjJ7WIpsZE,11709520,11714880,useful to the men of our century  i should simply say
InjJ7WIpsZE,11714880,11720640,in the name of god  stop a moment  cease your work
InjJ7WIpsZE,11720640,11728319,look  around you  an incredible reminder to never forget
InjJ7WIpsZE,11728319,11734000,where we are or what we were given  to remember that by breathing in the air
InjJ7WIpsZE,11734000,11740319,around us we have in a sense already won  and i love this because for a brief
InjJ7WIpsZE,11740319,11745680,moment in time  it swings that pendulum to the nothing
InjJ7WIpsZE,11745680,11750800,matters side of life  when you're living a miracle why sweat
InjJ7WIpsZE,11750800,11756640,the small stuff  and i can ask myself why do i get so
InjJ7WIpsZE,11756640,11764479,worked up it's no big deal  why not take the risk what's the worst  case that i fail and have to backtrack
InjJ7WIpsZE,11764479,11770239,as a now more informed and knowledgeable  person why not stand in the face of my  fears
InjJ7WIpsZE,11770239,11776239,the upside is consistently enticing it  consistently rewards
InjJ7WIpsZE,11776239,11783680,look around and see what life has  provided how dare  we waste it
InjJ7WIpsZE,11784479,11791120,and with that said i'd also  be remiss not to include this little  caveat you know i'm careful with the
InjJ7WIpsZE,11791120,11798560,words nothing matters  because even though in the context i've  been using it for years it's a positive
InjJ7WIpsZE,11798560,11806160,empowering thing it's my reminder to  push boundaries  i can also see how it begs the question
InjJ7WIpsZE,11806160,11811680,well if nothing matters why should i  care  and so
InjJ7WIpsZE,11811680,11816880,let's reframe  because it's not that nothing matters
InjJ7WIpsZE,11816880,11822239,it's that nothing outside the scope of  your world view matters it's the
InjJ7WIpsZE,11822239,11828920,acquisition of freedom  addition  by the subtraction of all those
InjJ7WIpsZE,11828920,11834960,externalities we let hold us back  because you know as well as i do it's
InjJ7WIpsZE,11834960,11842479,not really the externalities that  shackle you  it's your thoughts about them
InjJ7WIpsZE,11842479,11849040,so open the gate to your mind  let the detrimental out
InjJ7WIpsZE,11849040,11855520,and keep the necessary and the ideal in  nothing matters if it doesn't align with
InjJ7WIpsZE,11855520,11861200,your values and your destination  i know i say in every video speech
InjJ7WIpsZE,11861200,11867439,podcast episode that we are the authors  of our own stories
InjJ7WIpsZE,11867439,11873439,and it's because  we craft our nothings and our everything
InjJ7WIpsZE,11873439,11880160,it's because your universe the one  behind your eyes it needs a maker every
InjJ7WIpsZE,11880160,11887439,morning  and if you allow it  each sunrise can be your genesis
InjJ7WIpsZE,11887439,11895439,your own beautiful creation story  you have your hand on the dial
InjJ7WIpsZE,11895439,11900560,and so amidst this world of infinite  beauty and opportunity
InjJ7WIpsZE,11900560,11905760,look around you soak it all in ask  yourself what does freedom look like
InjJ7WIpsZE,11905760,11911439,feel like  because you were put here to pursue that
InjJ7WIpsZE,11911439,11917760,and outside of those parameters  i believe that nothing matters
InjJ7WIpsZE,11917760,11924399,so why not live like it dream like it  use the little thing in front of you to
InjJ7WIpsZE,11924399,11930000,build the big things that have not yet  arrived  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,11930000,11937030,walk away when it's misaligned and go  all in  when you know in your soul it's right
InjJ7WIpsZE,11937030,11943040,[Music]  there is everything to gain
InjJ7WIpsZE,11943520,11954120,and nothing  to lose  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,11967920,11977439,i woke up  put my coffee on the desk  open my laptop stared at a blank screen
InjJ7WIpsZE,11977439,11985120,and a little button popped up in the top  right corner  check for updates
InjJ7WIpsZE,11985600,11990160,nope  ask me again later
InjJ7WIpsZE,11990880,11997040,why why not now  i don't know i don't necessarily care  about the improvements i guess it's just
InjJ7WIpsZE,11997040,12001840,inconvenient  they can wait
InjJ7WIpsZE,12003279,12009359,and that's kind of it  [Music]  let's face it the laptop doesn't matter  the update
InjJ7WIpsZE,12009359,12015200,in this scenario is not important  but bear with me because i think what it
InjJ7WIpsZE,12015200,12021600,stands for  when you apply it to the big picture  does matter
InjJ7WIpsZE,12021600,12028720,our proclivity to take less because less  is  convenient
InjJ7WIpsZE,12028720,12034160,our predisposition to sell ourselves  short because it's safer to leave so
InjJ7WIpsZE,12034160,12040640,much of ourselves on the shelf  because well things don't break when
InjJ7WIpsZE,12040640,12048319,they're on the shelf  but you can't be both flawless and live
InjJ7WIpsZE,12048319,12056840,your life  because life comes with wear and tear  the value is the experience
InjJ7WIpsZE,12056960,12062640,and a flawless existence is void of  experience of stories of
InjJ7WIpsZE,12062640,12066529,adventure  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,12067840,12075439,there's a little parable  about two seeds being planted  [Music]  and one of them just wants to grow
InjJ7WIpsZE,12075439,12081840,wants to feel what the sun is like  wants to see how high she can get
InjJ7WIpsZE,12081840,12087910,experience the breeze the cool air  and so she grew
InjJ7WIpsZE,12087910,12094640,[Music]  and sure she dealt with hard days she  had her difficult times
InjJ7WIpsZE,12094640,12101520,but ultimately  grew to live her best life  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,12101520,12109520,the other seed  worried  worried about leaving her home
InjJ7WIpsZE,12109840,12116080,the world that was the ground around her  worried about damaging her roots worried  about what could be waiting for her in
InjJ7WIpsZE,12116080,12123040,the dark  about the sun being too hot and the  breeze too strong  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,12123040,12129359,and ultimately stayed right where she  was playing it safe until one morning
InjJ7WIpsZE,12129359,12135359,a chicken came wandering by and ate the  seed off the ground and see this spells
InjJ7WIpsZE,12135359,12142720,out a few things  one we can at any moment
InjJ7WIpsZE,12142720,12148800,decide to step into that next level  evolve into that next chapter
InjJ7WIpsZE,12149439,12155040,but also  not  doing so  [Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,12155040,12161680,comes with a cost  sometimes a hidden cost
InjJ7WIpsZE,12162239,12168399,there's a tendency to think that  preserving the status quo  because it's safe
InjJ7WIpsZE,12168399,12174239,is valuable  but understand something you are not a
InjJ7WIpsZE,12174239,12179760,collector's item  [Music]  you weren't made for preservation you
InjJ7WIpsZE,12179760,12185520,were made for growth  to expand
InjJ7WIpsZE,12185520,12191870,to reach out towards the heavens and  feel that sun that breeze
InjJ7WIpsZE,12191870,12199359,[Music]  and sure upgrading means vulnerability  it means accepting that the unknown is
InjJ7WIpsZE,12199359,12206000,bigger than you  but also contains within it everything
InjJ7WIpsZE,12206000,12209399,you need
InjJ7WIpsZE,12211600,12216640,whether it was people things money  resources
InjJ7WIpsZE,12216640,12222319,i used to think like that seed  right how can i hold on to what i have
InjJ7WIpsZE,12222319,12228160,contain play small i can't lose this  i've come too far i've worked too hard
InjJ7WIpsZE,12228160,12235520,what if everything goes wrong i can't  upgrade now  maybe later
InjJ7WIpsZE,12235520,12242800,maybe someday when the time is right  when it won't hurt or require that i  step outside of this little world i've
InjJ7WIpsZE,12242800,12247840,created but guess what  growth
InjJ7WIpsZE,12247840,12256000,always asks of us  that we leave the comfort of now it  always offers us the world
InjJ7WIpsZE,12256000,12261120,in exchange for the courage to see the  unseen and trust ourselves to bring it
InjJ7WIpsZE,12261120,12267279,to life  and when i realized this i saw how the
InjJ7WIpsZE,12267279,12273200,act of trying to perpetually maintain  the status quo is debilitating
InjJ7WIpsZE,12273200,12280399,it's looking at life through a lens of  scarcity it's only when you start to  grasp how abundant life is
InjJ7WIpsZE,12280399,12287359,that you realize  by simply stepping into that person you  are destined to be you'll attract what
InjJ7WIpsZE,12287359,12294880,matters  some things will go  you'll leave them behind
InjJ7WIpsZE,12294880,12300399,but those things no longer serve you  they played their part they added their
InjJ7WIpsZE,12300399,12305520,value  and are now merely stepping stones
InjJ7WIpsZE,12305520,12310800,as you move to something greater and  that's just it
InjJ7WIpsZE,12310800,12316640,sometimes living  means wishing you did things differently  looking back and acknowledging that you
InjJ7WIpsZE,12316640,12323680,need to be better  sometimes living means losing the wrong  people in your life to make space for
InjJ7WIpsZE,12323680,12328960,the right ones  sometimes it means spending days
InjJ7WIpsZE,12328960,12334399,months even years wandering down the  wrong path  so that you can get a glimpse so that
InjJ7WIpsZE,12334399,12341600,you can realize what the right path  looks like  sometimes it means no reward no
InjJ7WIpsZE,12341600,12347359,validation until that compounding  finally takes place finally you see just
InjJ7WIpsZE,12347359,12352880,how powerful those small steps were and  will always be
InjJ7WIpsZE,12352880,12358960,it means seeing yourself as the person  you know you can be  maybe not necessarily the one you are
InjJ7WIpsZE,12358960,12366160,today  but betting on yourself when no one else
InjJ7WIpsZE,12366160,12372960,would  there's an idea that people are neither  good nor evil
InjJ7WIpsZE,12372960,12378319,but they have both within them  they choose through their day-to-day
InjJ7WIpsZE,12378319,12385680,action how they'll live who they'll be  and sure this is a tad oversimplified  but i think the duality is useful right
InjJ7WIpsZE,12385680,12392640,because in a different context for  everything that occurs in your life  you can find a reason to celebrate
InjJ7WIpsZE,12392640,12398160,or a reason to grieve  a reason to grow or a reason to hide it
InjJ7WIpsZE,12398160,12405120,all comes down to what one chooses to  see how they choose to look at the world
InjJ7WIpsZE,12405120,12412880,i'll never forget when peterson talked  about curtains right with tears or holes  in them same world on the other side
InjJ7WIpsZE,12412880,12418560,but the opening that you choose to look  through  paints an entirely different picture
InjJ7WIpsZE,12418560,12423760,right contributes to an entirely  different understanding
InjJ7WIpsZE,12423840,12430399,and look i'm a pragmatist i just am i'd  never ask people to close their eyes and  pretend everything's perfect
InjJ7WIpsZE,12430399,12437120,to wander down the path before you  expecting everything to be easy no but  what i am saying
InjJ7WIpsZE,12437120,12442160,is that the path before you is where  you'll uncover the meaning in life and
InjJ7WIpsZE,12442160,12450160,meaning requires that we are from time  to time uncomfortable  to go where we most want to go we must
InjJ7WIpsZE,12450160,12455600,leave something behind in the reality is  that while it's scary
InjJ7WIpsZE,12455600,12461600,while it can be alarming and even  painful it is always worth it
InjJ7WIpsZE,12461600,12467520,that what's on the other side is what  makes life worth living i want you to  know
InjJ7WIpsZE,12467520,12473680,that you don't need to be walking into  the same rooms talking to the same  people doing the same things no not if
InjJ7WIpsZE,12473680,12480800,you've outgrown that reality  not if you're ready for the next chapter
InjJ7WIpsZE,12480800,12487439,so let's make a pact to view life not as  an obligation but as an opportunity
InjJ7WIpsZE,12487439,12492720,something challenging but beautiful  mysterious but plentiful let's view the
InjJ7WIpsZE,12492720,12499359,challenges along the way not as  something going wrong or some kind of  alarm
InjJ7WIpsZE,12499359,12505520,but rather an indication that you are  doing something  right that you're stepping into the

InjJ7WIpsZE,12511120,12518960,try new things take risks evolve  [Music]  this is what life is about
InjJ7WIpsZE,12518960,12526000,and if you can find it within yourself  to see it that way to be grateful for  the discomfort that makes its way in and
InjJ7WIpsZE,12526000,12535040,out of our lives  you'll know that you are evolving  reaching towards that sky
InjJ7WIpsZE,12535840,12542399,because the danger as far as i'm  concerned is never what happens along  the way
InjJ7WIpsZE,12542399,12547920,it's what doesn't happen  because we never let ourselves accept
InjJ7WIpsZE,12547920,12554800,what the world had to offer  and so on that note i think today is the
InjJ7WIpsZE,12554800,12561399,perfect day  to upgrade
InjJ7WIpsZE,12563600,12584369,[Music]
InjJ7WIpsZE,12588880,12590960,you
