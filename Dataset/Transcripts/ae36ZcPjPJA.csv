ae36ZcPjPJA,94480,101920,subscribed please subscribe and without further  ado here are my art hacks all right so for this  
ae36ZcPjPJA,101920,106960,very first art hack we're gonna talk about a  technique that i have used so much on my channel  
ae36ZcPjPJA,106960,111360,it helps save time it helps you create muscle  memory it's just all around it's life-changing  
ae36ZcPjPJA,111360,116240,and this of course is the chalk method now let's  say you have a photograph you have a drawing and  
ae36ZcPjPJA,116240,120079,you want to transfer it onto a new piece of paper  what you're going to do is get your photograph  
ae36ZcPjPJA,120080,124880,that you printed out or your drawing that you made  and you're going to get yourself some chalk pastel  
ae36ZcPjPJA,124880,129200,any kind of chalk will work and all you do is  rub chalk all around the back of your photograph  
ae36ZcPjPJA,129200,133440,or your drawing and once it's completely covered  in chalk what you're going to do is flip it back  
ae36ZcPjPJA,133440,137760,around and you're going to directly trace the  outline of your photograph and get down your  
ae36ZcPjPJA,137760,141840,proportions or whatever you're trying to work  on and once you're done following the lines  
ae36ZcPjPJA,142960,149360,there you go you transferred your outline onto  a new piece of paper now for this next art hack  
ae36ZcPjPJA,149360,153840,this is one that i found i think it was last  year when i found this video and like an art  
ae36ZcPjPJA,153840,157920,hack video i did and by the way for all of  these art hacks if i found them off tik tok  
ae36ZcPjPJA,157920,162640,or like from another youtuber or whatever i will  credit them down in the comment section down below  
ae36ZcPjPJA,162640,168080,but this art hack my guy i found it last year i  believe and i have not been able to shut up about  
ae36ZcPjPJA,168080,174320,it so usually really cheap acrylic paint it's not  necessarily the best it can be transparent it can  
ae36ZcPjPJA,174320,179360,be streaky and just all around it doesn't give  you that saturation that you want out of paint  
ae36ZcPjPJA,179360,187200,so the solution to that is cornstarch literally  all you do is get a little bit of cornstarch you  
ae36ZcPjPJA,187200,191840,add it to your cheap acrylic paint you don't want  it too thin because it won't do anything you don't  
ae36ZcPjPJA,191840,196560,want it too thick because then it'll kind of like  flake off you want kind of like a nice toothpaste  
ae36ZcPjPJA,196560,202319,texture and just like that it makes your paint  look like a thick body heavily opaque paint i  
ae36ZcPjPJA,202320,207680,don't know what kind of other worldly magic is  inside of this cornstarch but the difference that  
ae36ZcPjPJA,207680,214400,it makes with acrylic paint is night and day for  this next art hack i get asked all the time about  
ae36ZcPjPJA,214400,220799,how i blend my oil paints how i get them to be  so smooth and the answer to that drum roll please
ae36ZcPjPJA,223120,226560,makeup brushes regular paint brushes  they're kind of rough they add like a  
ae36ZcPjPJA,226560,232000,lot of weird scratches in your artwork so  what i do is i go in with a completely dry  
ae36ZcPjPJA,232000,238080,fluffy makeup brush and i just ever so lightly  dust between the two oil colors just like with the  
ae36ZcPjPJA,238080,243680,lightest little touch and let me tell you makeup  brushes blend like no other art supply before in  
ae36ZcPjPJA,243680,249040,fact just to make my point even more clear on  the bad side of this demonstration i ended up  
ae36ZcPjPJA,249040,254640,fixing it with a makeup brush just to show you how  well it works even under like bad circumstances  
ae36ZcPjPJA,255440,261359,for this next art hack this is one that i had  to end up teaching myself because at the time  
ae36ZcPjPJA,261359,266719,in college i was too poor to do anything else so  whenever you're working on art piece especially  
ae36ZcPjPJA,266720,271680,if it's charcoal which i love your blending  stumps can get very dirty very quickly what i  
ae36ZcPjPJA,271680,278080,like to do is get my blending stump and just ever  so lightly erase it directly over an eraser it'll  
ae36ZcPjPJA,278080,283759,take off a mass majority of the junk on it and for  me personally i keep repeating this entire process  
ae36ZcPjPJA,283760,288240,literally until that blending stump is like  disintegrated and it's just like shreds of paper  
ae36ZcPjPJA,290240,296639,this next art hack is going to be dedicated to my  super super super old school watchers the hack is  
ae36ZcPjPJA,296640,303120,is that water-based markers are basically free  watercolors so i believe it was back in 2017 i  
ae36ZcPjPJA,303120,308240,did the one marker art challenge and what  i did is i got just regular crayola marker  
ae36ZcPjPJA,308240,312720,and i collected some of the ink inside of a  palette and literally all you do is just get  
ae36ZcPjPJA,312720,318080,some water diluted a little bit and just like  that you've turned your markers into watercolor  
ae36ZcPjPJA,320480,325200,i'd like to dedicate this next art hack to all  of my digital artists out there i feel like  
ae36ZcPjPJA,325200,329920,because you guys are all so chill i feel like you  guys always get left out of art hacks but no not  
ae36ZcPjPJA,329920,333840,today i want to include you whenever you're doing  digital art you don't want your hand to rub all  
ae36ZcPjPJA,333840,338639,over the screen and get like whatever junk is on  your hand onto your screen and basically interrupt  
ae36ZcPjPJA,338640,343920,your entire drawing process you don't want that so  instead of spending ten dollars on a digital art  
ae36ZcPjPJA,343920,349600,glove you can make your own for free what you're  gonna do is get the cheapest one dollar felt  
ae36ZcPjPJA,349600,354800,glove that you can find you cut it from the thumb  all the way down to the second finger right here  
ae36ZcPjPJA,354800,361280,and literally you're done that's all the steps to  this and it works just like a regular glove except  
ae36ZcPjPJA,361280,368160,better it was free for this next art hack this one  goes out to all of my dollar tree lovers out there  
ae36ZcPjPJA,368160,372800,which by the way i am devastated by the fact that  they raised their prices from one dollar to now  
ae36ZcPjPJA,372800,379120,125. absolute chaos straight to jail i hate it but  anyway if you have a dollar store near you it's  
ae36ZcPjPJA,379120,384080,most likely that they sell either poster board or  poster board sheets and what people don't realize  
ae36ZcPjPJA,384080,389280,is that those sheets are actually really good  quality art paper what you're gonna do is get the  
ae36ZcPjPJA,389280,394080,paper and it has a shiny side and a matte side  flip it over to the matte side i like to go in  
ae36ZcPjPJA,394080,399680,with some sandpaper and just lightly sand off the  top layer just to create some like uh texture that  
ae36ZcPjPJA,399680,404000,way your like art supplies will stick to the paper  and this technique is great if you're just trying  
ae36ZcPjPJA,404000,408880,to save on money or you just live in a really  small town like i did that didn't have access to  
ae36ZcPjPJA,408880,414080,really nice high quality art paper again for this  art hack this is another one that i had to figure  
ae36ZcPjPJA,414080,418879,out in college when i couldn't afford anything  in your sketchbook if you make a drawing with  
ae36ZcPjPJA,418880,423920,charcoal or graphite it gets all over the place  it gets on your hand it gets on the other pages  
ae36ZcPjPJA,423920,428720,of the sketchbook and just all around it's a mess  so normally what you would use is a spray called  
ae36ZcPjPJA,430000,435680,fixative or is it fixive i can't remember right  off the bat basically it's a spray that locks  
ae36ZcPjPJA,435680,439840,down the graphite and the charcoal on the  page so it doesn't smear all over the place  
ae36ZcPjPJA,439840,444080,but if you're in college and you're making  tons of different sketches all the time it  
ae36ZcPjPJA,444080,448879,can get expensive to do that so in college  what we ended up doing was using hairspray  
ae36ZcPjPJA,448880,453600,if you want to lock in your sketchbook in place  i'm telling you guys hairspray is where it's at  
ae36ZcPjPJA,453600,460320,this next art hack isn't necessarily an art hack  per se it's more or less a traditional painters  
ae36ZcPjPJA,460320,466000,technique i'm going to show you three things the  first one is my makeup concealer this is what it  
ae36ZcPjPJA,466000,470560,looks like on a white piece of paper do you see  how dark it looks in comparison to the white  
ae36ZcPjPJA,470560,475840,and if i put that exact same concealer on a  black piece of paper do you see how bright  
ae36ZcPjPJA,475840,481440,and white it looks in comparison but if i was  to put that exact same concealer on a gray  
ae36ZcPjPJA,481440,486880,neutral piece of paper it's gonna look accurate  to thine skin color so that's why a lot of artists  
ae36ZcPjPJA,486880,491920,tone their canvas gray so they can accurately see  what colors they're accurately working with it  
ae36ZcPjPJA,491920,496880,seems like a really simple technique that doesn't  seem that important but trust me it makes a world  
ae36ZcPjPJA,496880,503120,of a difference when it comes to painting now i  actually saw this next one on tick tock literally  
ae36ZcPjPJA,503120,507919,a couple of days before i started filming  this video something that i didn't know and  
ae36ZcPjPJA,507920,514240,there's a huge chance that maybe you didn't know  is that you can actually clean your kneaded erasers  
ae36ZcPjPJA,514240,519440,i didn't know you could do that i never thought  to wash my eraser but you can apparently so all  
ae36ZcPjPJA,519440,524320,you're going to do is get your dirty kneaded  eraser put some hand soap on it and just lightly  
ae36ZcPjPJA,524320,528240,wash off all the dirty stuff and for  this hack you got to be careful not to  
ae36ZcPjPJA,528240,532959,like squish your kneaded eraser because then  it's going to get soap inside of the squishy  
ae36ZcPjPJA,532960,538160,stuff so every time you rinse you then squish  it to bring out more of the dirty stuff and just  
ae36ZcPjPJA,538160,544240,repeat the process until it's completely clean  this next tip is something that i feel so strongly  
ae36ZcPjPJA,544240,550160,about i considered actually making an entire video  on this one specific thing and that is how to take  
ae36ZcPjPJA,550160,555199,pictures of your artwork correctly and obviously  someone like me i have a professional setup where  
ae36ZcPjPJA,555200,561600,i can take pictures inside but i would argue that  you have one of the best lightings of all time  
ae36ZcPjPJA,561600,566800,the sun so immediately you can see a difference  from when you take your pictures inside under a  
ae36ZcPjPJA,566800,573279,ceiling lamp versus the sun which casts no shadows  it gives off a perfect neutral light and it  
ae36ZcPjPJA,573280,578240,accurately portrays your artwork in fact i know so  many artists who sell their artwork professionally  
ae36ZcPjPJA,578240,582160,a lot of them they don't even use their  professional setups they go outside and take their  
ae36ZcPjPJA,582160,587600,pictures just because it is that accurate next  up we have an art hack that i wish i would have  
ae36ZcPjPJA,587600,593519,known sooner if you have a paintbrush and it's  full of dried acrylic acetone removes the paint  
ae36ZcPjPJA,595120,598880,let your paintbrushes soak in acetone  for a while and eventually the paint just  
ae36ZcPjPJA,599520,606640,glides off i'm actually kind of mad now like how  come i didn't know this now for this next art  
ae36ZcPjPJA,606640,611920,hack this one i feel like might be kind of well  known but maybe not but i just wanted to include  
ae36ZcPjPJA,611920,617279,it just in case it's not well known and this can  go for either water-based markers or alcohol-based  
ae36ZcPjPJA,617280,622240,markers so whenever you have a marker and it's  kind of dried out or maybe it's not very smooth  
ae36ZcPjPJA,622240,627760,anymore and it's kind of like on its last leg what  you can do is get some alcohol and all you do is  
ae36ZcPjPJA,627760,633120,literally just re-wet the tip of the marker let  the alcohol soak in a little bit and you can use  
ae36ZcPjPJA,633120,637680,it way longer than you would have originally like  do you see the difference there it's incredible  
ae36ZcPjPJA,638960,644560,um miss chloe roseart if you're watching hello  there how you all doing shout out to you because  
ae36ZcPjPJA,645200,650480,you're where i got this from sometimes painter  tape just doesn't work like it's supposed to paint  
ae36ZcPjPJA,650480,655600,can get underneath it sometimes the tape messes  up it just doesn't do what it's supposed to do  
ae36ZcPjPJA,655600,660959,so what you're going to do is either get a white  clear gesso or a really cheap transparent white  
ae36ZcPjPJA,660960,665760,paint and what you're going to do is put that  transparent paint down first let it dry and  
ae36ZcPjPJA,665760,670000,then go in with the color that you were going  to go in with and i swear to god when you use  
ae36ZcPjPJA,670000,675520,a primer first it makes the painters tape work  10 times better and this is just a hack that i'm  
ae36ZcPjPJA,675520,682320,never not gonna do because it works so incredibly  well now for this next art hack this is one that  
ae36ZcPjPJA,682320,687840,i have been asked literally i would say probably  every single day since i started uploading on art  
ae36ZcPjPJA,687840,694160,youtube and that is how i blend colored pencils  and the secret to blending colored pencils is a  
ae36ZcPjPJA,694160,699360,white colored pencil i don't know what is inside  the prismacolor white colored pencil but it blends  
ae36ZcPjPJA,699360,703440,any two color pencils that you want and as  much as i love the karen dosh colored pencils  
ae36ZcPjPJA,703440,708640,i still have to use a white prismacolor even when  i'm using those like 200 colored pencils because  
ae36ZcPjPJA,708640,715760,white prisma colors just blend that well now for  this next art hack my secret is using white out  
ae36ZcPjPJA,715760,720720,all my drawings and paintings so let's say that  i am drawing an eyeball and i need to put a white  
ae36ZcPjPJA,720720,725839,highlight in the eye to make it look reflective  well instead of using colored pencils or a white  
ae36ZcPjPJA,725840,731280,pen i use white out and the reason i like whiteout  is because it's oil based which means that it'll  
ae36ZcPjPJA,731280,736080,stick on top of literally anything you want  and not just that but you can actually chip off  
ae36ZcPjPJA,736080,740880,white out it's like paint that's removable it's  incredible for this next art hack this is another  
ae36ZcPjPJA,740880,746080,one that i did that went absolutely crazy viral  i think on my youtube short channel it got like  
ae36ZcPjPJA,746080,750880,i can't even remember like 10 million views or  something like that it's crazy basically whenever  
ae36ZcPjPJA,750880,756000,you're coloring with a crayon usually you get that  weird blotchy crayon texture you know what i'm  
ae36ZcPjPJA,756000,760640,talking about but if you want it to look a little  bit more smooth what you can do is get your crayon  
ae36ZcPjPJA,760640,765680,pressed kind of hard on the area that you want to  color you get either your fingernail a coin or in  
ae36ZcPjPJA,765680,770240,my case one of those like pottery thingies i don't  know what they're called and you just scrape off  
ae36ZcPjPJA,770240,776480,the extra wax off the paper and let me tell you  whenever you do this it leaves such a beautiful  
ae36ZcPjPJA,776480,782240,smooth fully saturated coloring page it's crazy  like it doesn't even look like crayon anymore  
ae36ZcPjPJA,783760,788000,now for this next art hack let's say you have  a green color and it's too dark but if you add  
ae36ZcPjPJA,788000,792160,white paint to it then it turns it into like  a weird pastel green which you don't want  
ae36ZcPjPJA,792160,796399,so instead of using white paint to lighten  your artwork what i'm going to have you do  
ae36ZcPjPJA,796400,801600,is use a neon paint when you add neon paint  not only does it lighten it but it keeps that  
ae36ZcPjPJA,801600,806079,original color and it's just a good way to  get a more accurate color to what you want  
ae36ZcPjPJA,807760,813280,and lastly this brings me to the final art hack  whenever you're shading an artwork with a pen  
ae36ZcPjPJA,813280,819520,no matter how small the fine liner is it's still  gonna be super duper dark so my solution to that  
ae36ZcPjPJA,819520,823920,is literally a ballpoint pen if you get a  ballpoint pen and slightly turn it to the  
ae36ZcPjPJA,823920,831519,side and just like ever so slightly drag it across  the page i swear it gives the most beautiful light  
ae36ZcPjPJA,831520,836240,light gray shading that you're ever gonna  get it's really nice for very subtle shadows  
ae36ZcPjPJA,836240,840720,and i think it's because the ballpoint pen  ink is full of filler and it's not like as  
ae36ZcPjPJA,840720,846000,intensely black as a fine liner pen i don't  know it just works really good for shadows well  
ae36ZcPjPJA,846000,850560,there you guys go those are all of my  personal all-star art hacks and if you  
ae36ZcPjPJA,850560,855120,want to see me test even more art hacks i'll  leave a playlist right here if you haven't
