RUI1k-KHXNk,210,1620,- [David] No. - [Linus] Okay.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1620,2850,- [David] No.
RUI1k-KHXNk,2850,4000,- This is going great.
RUI1k-KHXNk,4000,6960,"We're back again with Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,6960,10970,"where Intel has given $5,000 tech makeovers"
RUI1k-KHXNk,10970,13260,"to Anthony, Riley, Dennis,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,13260,14870,"tons of members of the team so far,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,14870,16600,and we've seen some great themes.
RUI1k-KHXNk,16600,20170,"Like VR gaming, extreme comfort, and minimalism."
RUI1k-KHXNk,20170,24110,But today's is unlike anything we've seen so far.
RUI1k-KHXNk,24110,28260,James has what I would describe as the most honest theme.
RUI1k-KHXNk,28260,30390,"Hey, it's $5,000."
RUI1k-KHXNk,30390,31609,I'm gonna take advantage of this
RUI1k-KHXNk,31610,33453,to the greatest extent that I can.
RUI1k-KHXNk,35340,36484,- Don't you knock?
RUI1k-KHXNk,36484,39067,(upbeat music)
RUI1k-KHXNk,45400,48067,(air whooshing)
RUI1k-KHXNk,49362,52279,(light jazz music)
RUI1k-KHXNk,56158,58880,"Hi, my name is James, and I'm head of writing at LMG."
RUI1k-KHXNk,58880,61403,So I make sure the videos get made.
RUI1k-KHXNk,61403,65640,(light jazz music continues)
RUI1k-KHXNk,65640,68490,"Describing my current setup in one word,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,68490,71803,adequate or suboptimal.
RUI1k-KHXNk,73200,75079,"If you're a glass half full, half empty person,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,75080,76930,you could pick which way to go there.
RUI1k-KHXNk,79080,82220,"- Not gonna lie, your setup is pretty sick already."
RUI1k-KHXNk,82220,83390,What exactly are the pain points
RUI1k-KHXNk,83390,84490,we're trying to address today?
RUI1k-KHXNk,84490,86210,- I have these giant tower speakers.
RUI1k-KHXNk,86210,87140,"My speakers are pretty good,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,87140,88640,I didn't think that it was worth
RUI1k-KHXNk,88640,90470,changing them out with this budget.
RUI1k-KHXNk,90470,92100,"These are way, way, way bigger"
RUI1k-KHXNk,92100,93890,than anyone should have ever.
RUI1k-KHXNk,93890,94990,"Especially, this room."
RUI1k-KHXNk,94990,97340,"I should've got bookshelf, but I didn't know at the time."
RUI1k-KHXNk,97340,100280,"But even though they have these big eight-inch drivers,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,100280,103250,that's still not as good of bass as an actual subwoofer.
RUI1k-KHXNk,103250,105170,They don't go as low as an actual subwoofer.
RUI1k-KHXNk,105170,107049,So the biggest problem with my home theater setup
RUI1k-KHXNk,107050,108582,is that I don't have a subwoofer right now.
RUI1k-KHXNk,108582,110260,- You don't have.
RUI1k-KHXNk,110260,113620,"You have these ballin' speakers,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,113620,115160,and no subwoofer.
RUI1k-KHXNk,115160,116033,"- Yeah, exactly."
RUI1k-KHXNk,117340,118549,"- [Linus] This is pain point number two,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,118550,120290,this does seem that bad.
RUI1k-KHXNk,120290,122730,"- This is okay, but it doesn't have Atmos,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,122730,124420,not that I have any Atmos speakers right now.
RUI1k-KHXNk,124420,125530,but I want them in the future.
RUI1k-KHXNk,125530,127680,And it's also underpowering my speakers.
RUI1k-KHXNk,127680,130280,"I don't need more power for making them louder,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,130280,131720,but it's nice to have more headroom
RUI1k-KHXNk,131720,132959,to have a more dynamic sound.
RUI1k-KHXNk,132959,133792,- Right.
RUI1k-KHXNk,133792,135420,"- When you get those transients coming in,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,135420,136800,it'll be more lively sounding.
RUI1k-KHXNk,136800,139780,"Plus, this doesn't have the greatest room correction."
RUI1k-KHXNk,139780,141680,"And the solution that I have for it,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,141680,142609,has great room correction.
RUI1k-KHXNk,142610,144460,So I'm excited for that.
RUI1k-KHXNk,144460,147210,"- Hey, remember when we did the review video of this thing?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,147210,149410,But James actually has it legit.
RUI1k-KHXNk,149410,150830,"You won this at the Christmas party, right?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,150830,151663,- That's right.
RUI1k-KHXNk,151663,154030,"And so, today, I'm keeping this chassis and everything,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,154030,157440,we're just gonna shove a new GPU in this same form factor
RUI1k-KHXNk,157440,160590,and use a new Rocket Lake CPU on a new ITX motherboard.
RUI1k-KHXNk,160590,161900,"- [Linus] I don't wanna be a downer,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,161900,163180,but I couldn't help noticing
RUI1k-KHXNk,163180,165250,there was a 3080 over on the table there.
RUI1k-KHXNk,165250,167930,What are the odds that's gonna fit in here?
RUI1k-KHXNk,167930,168762,- It's gonna fit.
RUI1k-KHXNk,168763,171830,The final pain point is another home theater related one.
RUI1k-KHXNk,171830,173180,"Speakers are only half the equation,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,173180,175609,the other half is the room.
RUI1k-KHXNk,175610,178370,This is a giant reflective room.
RUI1k-KHXNk,178370,179959,Look at that big blank wall.
RUI1k-KHXNk,179960,180793,- [Linus] Yeah.
RUI1k-KHXNk,180793,182470,- And that's the first reflection point
RUI1k-KHXNk,182470,184980,"from this speaker just going bonk, right off of that."
RUI1k-KHXNk,184980,187030,"- Right, so your surround is gonna be"
RUI1k-KHXNk,187030,189050,just kind of all over the place.
RUI1k-KHXNk,189050,190890,- And it can make it harder to understand
RUI1k-KHXNk,190890,192480,what people are saying in movies.
RUI1k-KHXNk,192480,194300,"Now this is a living room, not a home theater."
RUI1k-KHXNk,194300,196890,"I can't do anything about this, you know?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,196890,199840,I can't put acoustic panels here or anything like that.
RUI1k-KHXNk,199840,202230,"- I mean, you can, but the wife approval factor"
RUI1k-KHXNk,202230,203610,is gonna be pretty low.
RUI1k-KHXNk,203610,205910,"- Well, case in point, look at this."
RUI1k-KHXNk,205910,208040,"This is seemingly a boho shelf,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,208040,211659,but actually these are acoustic foam inserts that I made.
RUI1k-KHXNk,211660,212930,"- [Linus] Oh, that's pretty cool."
RUI1k-KHXNk,212930,214280,Who knew you were crafty?
RUI1k-KHXNk,214280,215397,- Don't look too close at 'em.
RUI1k-KHXNk,215397,216310,(Linus laughing)
RUI1k-KHXNk,216310,217950,"So on that wall over there,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,217950,221160,"I figure we can make a bunch of DIY acoustic panels,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,221160,223030,"maybe even an art panel,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,223030,225850,and just fill that all up with as much treatment as we can.
RUI1k-KHXNk,225850,226820,- Are you telling me that these
RUI1k-KHXNk,226820,228590,are just a devious ploy as well?
RUI1k-KHXNk,228590,229920,Are these just bass traps?
RUI1k-KHXNk,229920,231130,"- No, we bought these in Morocco."
RUI1k-KHXNk,231130,232160,But you actually did uncover
RUI1k-KHXNk,232160,233530,another thing that I'm upgrading.
RUI1k-KHXNk,233530,234930,"These cables under here,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,234930,236599,"they were taped up with electrical tape and everything,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,236600,237433,"but it doesn't matter,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,237433,239385,my kid grabs them and rips them apart anyway.
RUI1k-KHXNk,239385,240290,(Linus laughs)
RUI1k-KHXNk,240290,242659,"And like, I just hate how they're dangling here."
RUI1k-KHXNk,242660,243960,"That's why I got this,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,243960,246330,adhesive vinyl that matches my floor.
RUI1k-KHXNk,246330,247840,- [Linus] That's kind of genius actually.
RUI1k-KHXNk,247840,250700,"- Except that I'm moving in like two weeks, so."
RUI1k-KHXNk,250700,251920,"- Before we look at the receiver,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,251920,253340,I have to do some of the traditional
RUI1k-KHXNk,253340,255620,poking around in people's homes.
RUI1k-KHXNk,255620,257669,"Nice cat tree, love it."
RUI1k-KHXNk,257670,259209,"Oh man, okay."
RUI1k-KHXNk,259209,261209,- [James] The essentials. - This is blatantly staged.
RUI1k-KHXNk,261209,262109,"If you're gonna stage it,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,262109,263919,you might as well just put them on like this.
RUI1k-KHXNk,263920,265580,You know? There.
RUI1k-KHXNk,265580,267879,These are some good quality baby toys.
RUI1k-KHXNk,267880,270570,"Hey, is this the same penguin that Nicole has at her desk?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,270570,271530,"- [James] Oh, maybe."
RUI1k-KHXNk,271530,272840,"- I recognize this one,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,272840,275280,stolen out of the hands of my child.
RUI1k-KHXNk,275280,278500,"These things are like A, the best,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,278500,279910,'cause kids absolutely love them
RUI1k-KHXNk,279910,280760,and use them all the time.
RUI1k-KHXNk,280760,284050,"But B, (beep) impossible to store."
RUI1k-KHXNk,284050,285550,"- That's nothing, look at this thing."
RUI1k-KHXNk,285550,286750,You know what this is?
RUI1k-KHXNk,286750,288070,- Is it a puzzle? - No.
RUI1k-KHXNk,288070,289310,- It looks like a puzzle. - No.
RUI1k-KHXNk,289310,290493,"- It's a potty. - No, it's not."
RUI1k-KHXNk,290493,292060,It's a headstand trainer.
RUI1k-KHXNk,292060,293242,- No.
RUI1k-KHXNk,293242,295642,- This is the kind of stupid stuff my wife buys.
RUI1k-KHXNk,296610,297550,"- Oh, my phone!"
RUI1k-KHXNk,297550,300979,"So it doesn't prevent you from falling over I don't,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,300980,302330,"oh, it does."
RUI1k-KHXNk,302330,303639,"Oh, so yeah."
RUI1k-KHXNk,303640,305004,It keeps you from going over.
RUI1k-KHXNk,305004,306180,- Is that what it does? - Yeah.
RUI1k-KHXNk,306180,307970,'Cause it'll support your shoulders.
RUI1k-KHXNk,307970,309360,Have you never tried it?
RUI1k-KHXNk,309360,310770,"- No, I don't need this (beep)."
RUI1k-KHXNk,310770,312690,- It's actually not the stupidest thing ever.
RUI1k-KHXNk,312690,314795,"I mean, it's stupid to- - If you use it!"
RUI1k-KHXNk,314795,316473,There's a little window behind it that opens like that.
RUI1k-KHXNk,316473,318612,"- [Linus] Oh, that's pretty cool."
RUI1k-KHXNk,318612,319880,"I like it, I like this sort of thing."
RUI1k-KHXNk,319880,322700,- [James] So that whole cat door apparatus like slides out.
RUI1k-KHXNk,322700,324290,"And check this out, see right here?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,324290,325300,I made this in the winter
RUI1k-KHXNk,325300,327919,and this is all like extraneous Rockwool
RUI1k-KHXNk,327920,329670,from the acoustic panel stuff.
RUI1k-KHXNk,329670,330503,- I like it.
RUI1k-KHXNk,330503,332860,"Oh, hold on, there's one last thing we have to look at."
RUI1k-KHXNk,332860,334879,Books are the absolute best way to judge someone
RUI1k-KHXNk,334880,335770,"when you go into their house,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,335770,337900,"especially, if you know them a little bit already."
RUI1k-KHXNk,337900,340550,"Chris Hadfield, ""An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth."""
RUI1k-KHXNk,340550,342120,I believe you actually read this.
RUI1k-KHXNk,342120,343690,"- I didn't, I bought it for my wife."
RUI1k-KHXNk,343690,346960,"- Do you actually read ""Lord of the Rings""?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,346960,348039,"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on."
RUI1k-KHXNk,348040,350890,"I think you forced yourself to read it once,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,350890,353410,but you hate Tom Bombadil as much as I do.
RUI1k-KHXNk,353410,355830,"- I read ""Lord of the Rings"" in high school."
RUI1k-KHXNk,355830,358909,That copy I've only read like the first 100 pages.
RUI1k-KHXNk,358910,360040,"- Wait, dammit, is this the,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,360040,361650,you haven't actually read it shelf?
RUI1k-KHXNk,361650,362949,I was bamboozled!
RUI1k-KHXNk,362950,364780,"- No, you're missing all the best ones."
RUI1k-KHXNk,364780,366330,"- [Linus] I fell for it. - ""American Psycho."""
RUI1k-KHXNk,366330,368300,"To be honest, I've only read parts"
RUI1k-KHXNk,368300,370300,"of it I guess. - Okay, no, he's a poser."
RUI1k-KHXNk,370300,371133,"No, no, you're done."
RUI1k-KHXNk,371133,371966,"You're out. - No, this is the best book."
RUI1k-KHXNk,371966,374060,"This is a copy of ""The Wealth of Nations,"" by Adam Smith,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,374060,375740,that I got from a used bookstore.
RUI1k-KHXNk,375740,378190,This is from like 1915 or something like that.
RUI1k-KHXNk,378190,379820,"I'm not really a Milton Friedman kind of guy,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,379820,381200,"but you've got to know your enemy, right?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,381200,382033,- Did you read it?
RUI1k-KHXNk,382033,383160,"- Oh, not the whole thing,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,383160,385307,but I've read. (Linus laughs)
RUI1k-KHXNk,385307,386140,"Hey, look, hey, wait."
RUI1k-KHXNk,386140,387640,I just saw my bookmark. - Poser.
RUI1k-KHXNk,387640,388900,"I gotta say after seeing,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,388900,392810,"particularly, David's and Dennis's mountains of technology,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,392810,395520,your haul here looks more focused maybe.
RUI1k-KHXNk,395520,399620,"- [James] Quality not quantity, $800, $2,700."
RUI1k-KHXNk,399620,400520,"- [Linus] Wait, what is that?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,400520,401819,- [James] This is my new AVR.
RUI1k-KHXNk,401820,405110,- You spent half your budget on a receiver?
RUI1k-KHXNk,405110,406373,"- Yes, yes I did."
RUI1k-KHXNk,407350,408183,- Wow.
RUI1k-KHXNk,410848,411681,Okay.
RUI1k-KHXNk,412720,414970,"Well, why don't we go straight into that?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,414970,417770,- You've got your mainstream kind of Best Buy receivers
RUI1k-KHXNk,417770,420000,"from Sound United, like Marantz and Denon."
RUI1k-KHXNk,420000,421980,And then you've got your next level of more expensive ones
RUI1k-KHXNk,421980,423500,that some people think is a waste of money.
RUI1k-KHXNk,423500,425000,"This is a higher tier,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,425000,426880,"supposedly made with better components,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,426880,428760,"kind of amplifier from Anthem,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,428760,430120,which is a Canadian company.
RUI1k-KHXNk,430120,431590,I was searching for something
RUI1k-KHXNk,431590,433500,that had really good room correction.
RUI1k-KHXNk,433500,436040,"So the top of the game there, within reason,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,436040,438000,"is gonna be either Dirac,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,438000,439480,"which you get in NAD products,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,439480,441940,"or ARC, which you get in Anthem products."
RUI1k-KHXNk,441940,443950,"I was really interested in getting a NAD one,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,443950,446430,but then I read all the owner's forum reviews
RUI1k-KHXNk,446430,448130,and there was just so many problems.
RUI1k-KHXNk,448130,448963,"Go for it, buddy."
RUI1k-KHXNk,448963,451230,So I went with Anthem 'cause they seem to be more reliable.
RUI1k-KHXNk,451230,452410,- [Linus] Okay. - I wanted something
RUI1k-KHXNk,452410,454790,"that was modern, like Atmos and stuff,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,454790,456580,"powerful and aesthetically pleasing,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,456580,458349,and I think this is the balance of all three.
RUI1k-KHXNk,458350,459620,One of the sweetest things about this
RUI1k-KHXNk,459620,461360,is that has Chromecast built in.
RUI1k-KHXNk,461360,462919,"And the reason I care,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,462920,465893,is because I hate YouTube Music.
RUI1k-KHXNk,467569,468402,What? What are you-
RUI1k-KHXNk,468402,470471,- But that has Chromecast functionality built into it.
RUI1k-KHXNk,470471,471422,"- Yeah, but the TV has to be on."
RUI1k-KHXNk,471422,472370,"- Oh, okay, all right."
RUI1k-KHXNk,472370,473360,"- Dude, don't get me into this."
RUI1k-KHXNk,473360,475439,"I have, okay, look at this."
RUI1k-KHXNk,475440,477770,Using the SHIELD remote is better with the SHIELD.
RUI1k-KHXNk,477770,480460,"However, I have to still use the LG remote"
RUI1k-KHXNk,480460,482530,if I wanna use the feature where I can hold
RUI1k-KHXNk,482530,484750,"down the voice command and say ""Screen off,"""
RUI1k-KHXNk,484750,485960,which would allow me to play music
RUI1k-KHXNk,485960,488060,and then have the TV screen turn off.
RUI1k-KHXNk,488060,490220,"But then if you hit any button, it turns back on."
RUI1k-KHXNk,490220,492570,And then using this remote fricking sucks.
RUI1k-KHXNk,492570,493830,Like there's a lot of problems
RUI1k-KHXNk,493830,495889,that it doesn't interface quite well with CEC.
RUI1k-KHXNk,495890,499080,"So like, no, this feature matters to me!"
RUI1k-KHXNk,499080,501240,"- Okay, all right, thanks, Intel."
RUI1k-KHXNk,501240,502860,"You're so fired up, James."
RUI1k-KHXNk,502860,504680,- I've been waiting for a long time for this.
RUI1k-KHXNk,504680,506340,This knob. - It feels real good.
RUI1k-KHXNk,506340,507740,- That's a good knob. - I already touched it
RUI1k-KHXNk,507740,508573,when you weren't looking.
RUI1k-KHXNk,508573,509419,"- [James] Wait, there's more, Linus."
RUI1k-KHXNk,509420,510838,"- Wait, is this like room correction"
RUI1k-KHXNk,510838,512640,infrared apparatus or something?
RUI1k-KHXNk,512640,515659,"- Yeah, so receivers typically come with a microphone"
RUI1k-KHXNk,515659,516492,with which you can-
RUI1k-KHXNk,516492,519149,"- Yeah, but like it's a toy."
RUI1k-KHXNk,519150,521789,"- But this one, as far as I can tell,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,521789,524259,this is just a rebranded UMIK-1.
RUI1k-KHXNk,524260,526830,"And the UMIK-1 is a $200,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,526830,530180,kind of the standard measurement microphone that people use.
RUI1k-KHXNk,530180,531910,And now I've also confirmed
RUI1k-KHXNk,531910,535029,that this thing is not software locked to their software.
RUI1k-KHXNk,535030,536660,You can just plug this into your laptop
RUI1k-KHXNk,536660,539589,and use it with REW or what other software you want.
RUI1k-KHXNk,539590,541110,- [Linus] Does it come with like a stand
RUI1k-KHXNk,541110,543380,"for it and everything? - Hell yeah, a full tripod."
RUI1k-KHXNk,543380,544990,- What the hell?
RUI1k-KHXNk,544990,545823,"I got to tell you,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,545823,548160,"as someone who's pretty happy with my Sonos ARC,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,548160,550290,I'm finding some aspects of this upgrade
RUI1k-KHXNk,550290,552850,a little hard to justify.
RUI1k-KHXNk,552850,554810,So why don't we start with the before?
RUI1k-KHXNk,554810,556855,Why do we always end up in bed together?
RUI1k-KHXNk,556855,558339,- [James] This always happens.
RUI1k-KHXNk,558340,559925,I think it's my turn to wear the wig.
RUI1k-KHXNk,559925,562130,- The acoustics in this room really are terrible.
RUI1k-KHXNk,562130,565480,- The volume of air in here goes all through the house.
RUI1k-KHXNk,565480,566649,My home theater doesn't know
RUI1k-KHXNk,566650,569060,that there's an imaginary wall right here.
RUI1k-KHXNk,569060,571320,It has to pressurize all the way to the front door.
RUI1k-KHXNk,571320,572530,- And passed.
RUI1k-KHXNk,572530,573760,- [James] I think these eight-inch woofers
RUI1k-KHXNk,573760,574710,just can't do that.
RUI1k-KHXNk,574710,576070,"Plus, they're not gonna have the extension,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,576070,577210,they're just not gonna go as low.
RUI1k-KHXNk,577210,580690,"- Yeah, I'm still very surprised at how bad it sounds."
RUI1k-KHXNk,580690,582300,- You can hear the bass more on that one.
RUI1k-KHXNk,582300,583310,"- Yeah, I can hear it,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,583310,585130,but you're not supposed to hear bass.
RUI1k-KHXNk,585130,586830,"You're supposed to feel, like there's nothing."
RUI1k-KHXNk,586830,588600,There's no arousal whatsoever.
RUI1k-KHXNk,588600,590839,"I'd love to help, but you know how it is with cats."
RUI1k-KHXNk,590840,592130,"You can't really,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,592130,593560,"oh, you're not gonna,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,593560,596660,"oh you moved her, poor thing."
RUI1k-KHXNk,596660,597800,- [James] Stop looking at her butthole.
RUI1k-KHXNk,597800,598633,- I'm not looking at her butthole.
RUI1k-KHXNk,598633,600110,Her tail's down.
RUI1k-KHXNk,600110,601760,- I think what we should do is unplug
RUI1k-KHXNk,601760,603100,the existing receiver. - Yep.
RUI1k-KHXNk,603100,604579,"- Put on banana plugs,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,604580,605900,which will make it way more convenient
RUI1k-KHXNk,605900,607317,when I move. - In two weeks.
RUI1k-KHXNk,607317,609670,- And have to plug everything back in.
RUI1k-KHXNk,609670,611600,And get this in place.
RUI1k-KHXNk,611600,612433,"- Okay, let's do it."
RUI1k-KHXNk,612433,614130,"Ho, oh god!"
RUI1k-KHXNk,614130,617420,"Oh no, the plant was overwatered"
RUI1k-KHXNk,617420,619320,and it sogged in and swelled.
RUI1k-KHXNk,619320,621280,"- [James] Dammit, I spent $30 on this thing."
RUI1k-KHXNk,621280,623810,"- All right, give me some banana plugs, I'm ready."
RUI1k-KHXNk,623810,626040,"- Oh, they're all individually wrapped."
RUI1k-KHXNk,626040,628860,"No, that's way more plastic than I want."
RUI1k-KHXNk,628860,631620,"I want this to be in the same spot this is in,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,631620,632600,so it's not so easy
RUI1k-KHXNk,632600,633737,as like taking them and putting them here.
RUI1k-KHXNk,633737,635210,'Cause they have to go through the same
RUI1k-KHXNk,635210,636250,cable management hole.
RUI1k-KHXNk,636250,637640,"So is this a one person job,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,637640,639320,if we only have that one screwdriver that fits?
RUI1k-KHXNk,639320,640980,- Yes. - Okay.
RUI1k-KHXNk,640980,641870,- See you later.
RUI1k-KHXNk,641870,643187,"- Oh, I'll got a bed."
RUI1k-KHXNk,643187,645810,- (laughs) I might even join you.
RUI1k-KHXNk,645810,646960,"For those of you who aren't familiar,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,646960,647860,this is how this works.
RUI1k-KHXNk,647860,649300,You just take your bare wire.
RUI1k-KHXNk,649300,651050,"And usually you would like, I don't know,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,651050,652649,"sandpaper it a little bit or something,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,652650,654810,because you care about it making really good contact.
RUI1k-KHXNk,654810,656380,"But, realistically, we all know"
RUI1k-KHXNk,656380,657500,"that's not gonna make a difference,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,657500,659010,so I'm just gonna pop that in there.
RUI1k-KHXNk,659010,661230,- And this is the subwoofer I got.
RUI1k-KHXNk,661230,664440,The ever popular SVS SB-2000 Pro.
RUI1k-KHXNk,664440,666040,The S means it's sealed.
RUI1k-KHXNk,666040,668339,The B means it's a box instead of a cylinder.
RUI1k-KHXNk,668340,671060,And the pro means that I can use it with an app.
RUI1k-KHXNk,671060,674140,"- And now we go from just having ugly, horrible,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,674140,675690,"bare wire that is a pain in the butt,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,675690,677410,"and hurts your fingers to plug in,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,677410,679410,to screwing this guy on.
RUI1k-KHXNk,679410,680316,"Oh, look at that!"
RUI1k-KHXNk,680317,682903,And it plugs right back into that same.
RUI1k-KHXNk,683890,686050,"Well, you gotta tighten the thing, I guess."
RUI1k-KHXNk,686050,689339,"But then it plugs right back into that, right back in!"
RUI1k-KHXNk,689340,690173,There it is.
RUI1k-KHXNk,690173,691940,"- It comes in two colors,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,691940,695960,"black ash, which is similar to my speakers,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,695960,698790,and then glossy piano black.
RUI1k-KHXNk,698790,700589,But I went for the black ash.
RUI1k-KHXNk,700590,702660,"- [Linus] You like that black ash, don't you?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,702660,703493,- [David] That's not black ash.
RUI1k-KHXNk,703493,704839,- They sent piano black!
RUI1k-KHXNk,704840,706930,This costs $100 more.
RUI1k-KHXNk,706930,707830,- Oh really? - I'm not taking
RUI1k-KHXNk,707830,708820,that into my budget.
RUI1k-KHXNk,708820,711863,"I appreciate you SVS, my budget allocated 800, not 900."
RUI1k-KHXNk,711863,714440,- This is gonna sound so much better.
RUI1k-KHXNk,714440,716040,"- Oh, this thing's gonna haul (beep)."
RUI1k-KHXNk,716040,718110,- I honestly thought that you were kind of wasting
RUI1k-KHXNk,718110,719320,"a lot of your money,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,719320,720823,until I heard the before.
RUI1k-KHXNk,722670,726120,"- I would like to run naked, no grill, but I have a toddler."
RUI1k-KHXNk,726120,727750,That's why even on these beautiful eclipses
RUI1k-KHXNk,727750,728850,"I have all the grills on,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,728850,731540,'cause they like to touch stuff and color.
RUI1k-KHXNk,731540,733740,"And, crucially, I got this kit."
RUI1k-KHXNk,733740,736080,The SoundPath Subwoofer Isolation System.
RUI1k-KHXNk,736080,739020,So these are for decoupling your subwoofer from the floor.
RUI1k-KHXNk,739020,741880,"The last thing you want is for your subwoofer to growl,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,741880,744680,and then to hear a rattling somewhere else in your house.
RUI1k-KHXNk,744680,746290,So these are the feet they come with.
RUI1k-KHXNk,746290,748259,They are not hard plastic.
RUI1k-KHXNk,748260,749590,They're not that substantial.
RUI1k-KHXNk,749590,752940,And here is the foot we're going to be replacing it with.
RUI1k-KHXNk,752940,753890,Look at that.
RUI1k-KHXNk,753890,756090,"- [Linus] Oh, I like feet, I wanna see it."
RUI1k-KHXNk,756090,758120,"- Well, it kind of looks like a flashlight actually."
RUI1k-KHXNk,758120,758953,- Oh god.
RUI1k-KHXNk,758953,761740,"- So subwoofer placement is a thing,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,761740,763770,"especially, if you have multiple subwoofers."
RUI1k-KHXNk,763770,766090,"If you only have one subwoofer and you're in a small room,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,766090,769350,"and there's only one or two logical places to put it,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,769350,771350,then you should just put it where you're gonna put it.
RUI1k-KHXNk,771350,774009,"But if you have multiple potential spots,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,774010,776680,you should do what's called a subwoofer crawl.
RUI1k-KHXNk,776680,779410,And so what that is is you play bass sweeps
RUI1k-KHXNk,779410,781009,and you move your subwoofer
RUI1k-KHXNk,781010,783820,"around to different parts of the room until,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,783820,785770,"when you're sitting in your main listing position,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,785770,789390,that bass sweep is an equal volume across the frequencies.
RUI1k-KHXNk,789390,791070,I'm not gonna do a subwoofer crawl right now.
RUI1k-KHXNk,791070,792820,I'm just gonna plug it in (laughs).
RUI1k-KHXNk,794618,795959,- [Linus] 'Cause I'm moving in two weeks.
RUI1k-KHXNk,795960,796860,"- Yeah, exactly."
RUI1k-KHXNk,796860,799310,My kid is gonna use this to climb onto the couch.
RUI1k-KHXNk,799310,801760,"Phantom cables, I don't think this is the most expensive"
RUI1k-KHXNk,801760,804830,"one they sell, but this is a nice amount of shielding."
RUI1k-KHXNk,804830,805870,I'm pretty happy with this.
RUI1k-KHXNk,805870,807240,I'm excited about the cable.
RUI1k-KHXNk,807240,809730,"- Hey, I mean, I'm sitting over here fondling cables"
RUI1k-KHXNk,809730,811230,"for the last half an hour, so."
RUI1k-KHXNk,811230,813040,- This couch has made it really hard
RUI1k-KHXNk,813040,814160,"to find a new place to live,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,814160,815540,'cause it's just such a huge couch.
RUI1k-KHXNk,815540,817620,I'm basically in bed all the time.
RUI1k-KHXNk,817620,819089,- [Linus] I am done with banana plugs.
RUI1k-KHXNk,819090,821060,- Should we do the vinyl floor thing?
RUI1k-KHXNk,821060,821893,"- Oh, totally."
RUI1k-KHXNk,821893,822726,But I think we should do that
RUI1k-KHXNk,822726,824370,after we put the new receiver in.
RUI1k-KHXNk,824370,825900,I keep trying to sit on this table
RUI1k-KHXNk,825900,826950,and it's a piece of (beep).
RUI1k-KHXNk,826950,828270,"- [James] Yeah, I spent like $99"
RUI1k-KHXNk,828270,829560,off Facebook Marketplace for that thing.
RUI1k-KHXNk,829560,831230,"- [Linus] Okay, that was too much."
RUI1k-KHXNk,831230,832639,"- [James] Goodbye, slim friend."
RUI1k-KHXNk,832640,835820,"Hello, chunky hybrid class A."
RUI1k-KHXNk,835820,837570,"- [Linus] Okay, that's deep enough."
RUI1k-KHXNk,837570,839290,- [James] That's what he said.
RUI1k-KHXNk,839290,840977,"- There's a really stiff HDMI cable, James."
RUI1k-KHXNk,840977,842410,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
RUI1k-KHXNk,842410,843560,"I got this, I got this."
RUI1k-KHXNk,843560,844700,Are you trying to capture the moment
RUI1k-KHXNk,844700,846050,where I realize that I don't got this?
RUI1k-KHXNk,846050,847350,- One thing to know about this receiver
RUI1k-KHXNk,847350,848790,is that it's not the best option
RUI1k-KHXNk,848790,850560,for people who have multiple subs.
RUI1k-KHXNk,850560,852529,And that is because inside
RUI1k-KHXNk,852530,854460,"there's not two different circuit paths,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,854460,856470,it's actually just an internal Y splitter.
RUI1k-KHXNk,856470,858829,"So the two different ports you have for subs,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,858830,860180,just go to the same thing.
RUI1k-KHXNk,860180,861779,And the reason that's not great
RUI1k-KHXNk,861780,864220,"is 'cause when you get to the room correction part of it,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,864220,867699,it can't separately tune the two subwoofers.
RUI1k-KHXNk,867700,871050,"You work on the PC, I'll build some acoustic panels."
RUI1k-KHXNk,871050,872740,"We'll do the ARC Genesis set up after,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,872740,874480,because it requires using the PC.
RUI1k-KHXNk,874480,875675,- And we'll be ready to go.
RUI1k-KHXNk,875675,876529,- So I'm gonna work backwards
RUI1k-KHXNk,876530,878010,and show you the finished product.
RUI1k-KHXNk,878010,880190,This is a finished acoustic panel.
RUI1k-KHXNk,880190,881600,It's got some white fabric on it
RUI1k-KHXNk,881600,883089,that is acoustically transparent.
RUI1k-KHXNk,883090,884640,You can tell 'cause you can hold it up
RUI1k-KHXNk,884640,885473,"and see light come through it,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,885473,886306,and you hold up to your mouth
RUI1k-KHXNk,886306,887139,and you can breathe through it.
RUI1k-KHXNk,887139,889329,I just stretched it over this wooden frame
RUI1k-KHXNk,889330,891320,and stapled it and put some hangers on it.
RUI1k-KHXNk,891320,893210,This is a partially completed one
RUI1k-KHXNk,894190,895603,that's full of Rockwool.
RUI1k-KHXNk,896950,897783,This stuff is cool.
RUI1k-KHXNk,897783,899960,It's not like the pink insulation
RUI1k-KHXNk,899960,901720,"that you have to wear a mask and goggles for,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,901720,902649,and that irritates your skin.
RUI1k-KHXNk,902650,904000,This stuff is super workable.
RUI1k-KHXNk,904000,906220,You can cut it with just a bread knife.
RUI1k-KHXNk,906220,907470,"You can touch it, handle it."
RUI1k-KHXNk,907470,909290,"- Now, James, I couldn't help overhearing before,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,909290,911670,that you're planning to sell your receiver to David
RUI1k-KHXNk,911670,913200,after the video is done.
RUI1k-KHXNk,913200,914420,And I couldn't help noticing
RUI1k-KHXNk,914420,916810,that you've got an RTX graphics card
RUI1k-KHXNk,916810,918080,already in your rig.
RUI1k-KHXNk,918080,921110,"So are you planning to not just get a tech upgrade,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,921110,922500,but also make some money here?
RUI1k-KHXNk,922500,924490,"- You know, I gotta keep up with all the other guys here"
RUI1k-KHXNk,924490,927040,"and get a 3080, 'cause that's the thing to do."
RUI1k-KHXNk,927040,929009,"Being able to do so at MSRP,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,929010,931940,"giving me two very good PCs at the end is great,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,931940,933760,because I have some people in my life
RUI1k-KHXNk,933760,935390,who I'd love to give a PC to.
RUI1k-KHXNk,935390,937230,"- [David] How hard is this system to work in, Linus?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,937230,940610,"It's clearly designed to be built once at a factory,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,940610,942070,and then not really worked on.
RUI1k-KHXNk,942070,946270,"But for a pre-built, it uses completely standard components,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,946270,948520,so I can't really complain.
RUI1k-KHXNk,948520,950170,"- Ah, crap, it split the wood."
RUI1k-KHXNk,950170,953006,"- Oh man, this is really fricking tight."
RUI1k-KHXNk,953006,956060,"James, how am I gonna put the new motherboard in here?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,956060,958860,"- [James] Okay, this is, oh god, don't even look at this."
RUI1k-KHXNk,958860,959693,This is really bad.
RUI1k-KHXNk,959693,962350,"- Oh what the, what are you doing over there?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,962350,965170,I didn't think I was doing this home upgrade with Dennis.
RUI1k-KHXNk,965170,968399,Your Wi-Fi is hooked up like internally
RUI1k-KHXNk,968400,970820,to antennas that are built into the case.
RUI1k-KHXNk,970820,973100,How does this power supply?
RUI1k-KHXNk,973100,976199,I am going to have to completely tear this thing down.
RUI1k-KHXNk,976200,977530,I have to get the power supply
RUI1k-KHXNk,977530,980800,out in order to remove these Wi-Fi wires.
RUI1k-KHXNk,980800,981859,- I pulled a David.
RUI1k-KHXNk,981859,983940,- [David] That's not what happened with me.
RUI1k-KHXNk,983940,985930,"- Well, not exactly, but similar."
RUI1k-KHXNk,985930,988930,"Hey, David, David, David. - Yes."
RUI1k-KHXNk,988930,990230,"- Oh, my god."
RUI1k-KHXNk,990230,992329,"You're in luck, James."
RUI1k-KHXNk,992330,994260,I am extracting your Wi-Fi.
RUI1k-KHXNk,994260,995180,- [James] Thank you.
RUI1k-KHXNk,995180,998370,- There's just a couple little antenna PCBs here
RUI1k-KHXNk,998370,1000170,that need to pop off the bottom feet.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1000170,1001260,"- [James] All right, I'm just gonna do"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1001260,1003090,this over my kitchen sink I think.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1003090,1003923,- [Linus] What are you even doing?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1003923,1005730,- [James] I'm just lopping 1/8 of an inch off.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1005730,1007149,"- [Linus] Wait, over the sink?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1007150,1008740,"- [James] Well, yeah, I can scoop it out."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1008740,1009839,- Let's have a look at the motherboard
RUI1k-KHXNk,1009840,1010950,we're using for the upgrade.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1010950,1012110,Really nice little board.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1012110,1012943,Lots of features.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1012943,1016040,So we've got Wi-Fi AC now with an Intel chip.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1016040,1017880,We've got USB 3.1.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1017880,1019670,"We've got Type-C, we've got,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1019670,1020910,is this 2.5 gig LAN?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1020910,1022600,- [James] I believe it is. - Nice!
RUI1k-KHXNk,1022600,1023433,We've got support
RUI1k-KHXNk,1023433,1027630,for the latest Intel 11th gen processors on an LGA 1200.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1027630,1030370,"So because James isn't gonna be overclocking,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1030370,1033620,it's not necessary for us to go with a Z-series chipset.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1033620,1036230,We've got a Core i7-11700.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1036230,1038100,We've got an H570.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1038100,1039919,And then we're actually reusing his memory
RUI1k-KHXNk,1039920,1040829,"from his old system,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1040829,1044742,"which is wow, 2666."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1045761,1046983,(saw motor running)
RUI1k-KHXNk,1046983,1050750,(saw motor stopping)
RUI1k-KHXNk,1050750,1052650,"- Eye protection, use it."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1052650,1055050,"- Yeah, if you ever feel like upgrading your memory,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1055050,1056390,that's probably gonna hold you back
RUI1k-KHXNk,1056390,1058010,"just a little bit with this puppy,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1058010,1059750,"but, hopefully, it's fine."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1059750,1062048,"- [David] Oh, we don't have thermal paste."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1062048,1062965,- We don't?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1064550,1065383,I have a plan.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1065383,1067810,"First, let's go ahead and install the CPU."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1067810,1070280,"Oh, no way, this is awesome!"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1070280,1072570,"Check this out, so this motherboard,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1072570,1075690,because you've got support for PCI Express gen four
RUI1k-KHXNk,1075690,1078690,"on Intel's 11th gen processors,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1078690,1081009,you can have a high-speed M.2
RUI1k-KHXNk,1081010,1082910,"that runs at gen four speeds,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1082910,1086090,and then you can have like a normal gen three one.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1086090,1088740,"And even though this is an ITX board,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1088740,1092490,they actually managed to put two M.2 slots on it
RUI1k-KHXNk,1092490,1095840,without like a big sort of like riser
RUI1k-KHXNk,1095840,1097549,that comes off the board or anything like that.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1097550,1098930,"Check this out, it's just right here"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1098930,1101363,under their M.2 Armor heat sink.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1102305,1104480,"Fricking awesome, I love it."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1104480,1105679,"- So, no."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1105680,1106750,"- [Linus] If you need help with the power tools,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1106750,1107878,I can help you.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1107878,1110258,- Psh. (Linus laughs)
RUI1k-KHXNk,1110258,1112700,"It's just so annoying not having like clamps and stuff,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1112700,1113533,or the vice grips.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1113533,1114366,- Here's my plan.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1114366,1115730,"We don't have any thermal compound,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1115730,1118700,but I have some experience with these things.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1118700,1120519,Reusing thermal compound. - No.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1120520,1123570,"- Unfortunately, there's not enough really on here"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1123570,1127740,for us to just kind of plunk it onto a new clean CPU.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1127740,1129860,So what we're gonna do is we're just gonna
RUI1k-KHXNk,1129860,1134270,kind of salvage as much of this back as we can here.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1134270,1135170,- Pilots are done.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1136110,1137530,- [David] No. - [Linus] Okay.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1137530,1138730,- [David] No.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1138730,1139820,- [Linus] This is going great.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1139820,1141299,"- Oh yeah, we're gonna be done at like two."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1141300,1144290,"- Oh, I mostly just meant my thermal paste application here."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1144290,1145540,"Now I understand, David,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1145540,1146527,"you might look at this and go,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1146527,1148919,"""Gee, Linus, I don't know if that's enough thermal paste,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1148920,1152310,"especially, 'cause it's old and desiccated."""
RUI1k-KHXNk,1152310,1153720,That's where the stock heat sink
RUI1k-KHXNk,1153720,1155640,that came with the CPU comes in.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1155640,1157870,"We don't wanna use this heat sink,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1157870,1159870,but we can get a little bit
RUI1k-KHXNk,1159870,1162360,of extra fresh thermal paste off of it.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1162360,1163500,"Oh wow, this stuff's way better."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1163500,1164650,I should've just used this.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1164650,1166610,- Is Linus somehow trying to make my upgrade
RUI1k-KHXNk,1166610,1168193,"more jank than yours, David?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1169140,1171030,"- It's not trying, succeeding."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1171030,1172550,- I found the extra Rockwool.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1172550,1174230,The highest frequencies that come into your stereo
RUI1k-KHXNk,1174230,1178360,can get absorbed by like curtains or a thick rug.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1178360,1180390,"But the lower you go, the deeper you need,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1180390,1181830,because the wavelengths are longer.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1181830,1183570,"So this is about four inches,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1183570,1185299,"or actually, I think it's 5 1/2 inches thick."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1185300,1187460,This is kind of too thick to hang off of my wall.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1187460,1188299,That wouldn't really look like
RUI1k-KHXNk,1188300,1189890,a normal painting or anything.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1189890,1191330,So I'm actually gonna take a bread knife
RUI1k-KHXNk,1191330,1192220,and cut this in half.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1192220,1195130,"- Oh, this is really tight."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1195130,1197510,Just get out of the way!
RUI1k-KHXNk,1197510,1199190,- It really does just go right in there.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1199190,1200590,"So I'm just pulling this tight,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1200590,1202539,so it's wrinkle-free on the other side.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1203500,1207400,I did the opposite ends first to get that access tight.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1207400,1208820,"And then now I'm gonna go to the side,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1208820,1209750,starting with the middle.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1209750,1210760,- I'm just checking the front panel
RUI1k-KHXNk,1210760,1212010,connector configurations.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1212010,1215280,"Usually, from one brand to the same brand, it's the same."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1215280,1217110,"But sometimes when you switch brands, they're different."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1217110,1219410,"Usually, they print the key somewhere on the PCB."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1219410,1220610,"But on these really small boards,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1220610,1222330,they often can't fit it right next to it.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1222330,1223980,So you can see this one's over here.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1223980,1226240,But it looks like they're the same.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1226240,1228550,"So I can just plunk that in, excellent."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1228550,1231410,- So one of those front USB ports has some gunk on it
RUI1k-KHXNk,1231410,1232243,that doesn't work.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1232243,1233076,I was hoping you could-
RUI1k-KHXNk,1233076,1233909,"- [Linus] Mhmm, I'm sorry to hear that."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1233909,1235767,- Maybe you could do something about that.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1235767,1237179,"- [Linus] Oh, I see, that's where you're going with it."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1237180,1239820,"- Well, you don't just get $5,000 of Intel's money,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1239820,1242370,you get eight hours of Linus's time.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1242370,1243500,The only thing left to do now
RUI1k-KHXNk,1243500,1245530,is put some fabric on the back.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1245530,1247390,"So if you don't wanna use the same fabric you did on front,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1247390,1250050,you can cheap out and get either burlap.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1250050,1253480,Or if the fabric store you go to just have a bin of crap
RUI1k-KHXNk,1253480,1256460,"that's like refuse, that's what I got."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1256460,1258000,"Mine happens to be white,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1258000,1261510,but it just serves to cover up and make it a little nicer.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1261510,1262640,- And I've got an update too.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1262640,1265410,I've got my motherboard and CPU in.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1265410,1267420,I've got all the cable management done on the side.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1267420,1269170,I think this panel should close.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1269170,1271360,So all that remains for me
RUI1k-KHXNk,1271360,1273590,is to put in the RTX 3080.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1273590,1276700,"Look at that, it's almost like it's new."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1276700,1278210,You left the peel on there and everything.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1278210,1280899,You pretended that you weren't using it for three weeks.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1280900,1281733,You know what?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1281733,1282970,"This was a little annoying to work in,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1282970,1286159,but good job MSI for making a pre-built
RUI1k-KHXNk,1286160,1287910,that's actually upgradable
RUI1k-KHXNk,1287910,1289660,with completely standard parts.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1289660,1291590,- [James] Look how spacious that GPU cave is.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1291590,1293860,"- Yeah, totally, you could absolutely"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1293860,1295210,"do like anything in here,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1295210,1296659,as long as it's not triple thick.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1296660,1298620,- We're finished with all the acoustic panels.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1298620,1300510,I have four white ones like this.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1300510,1303920,"But why just stick with white,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1303920,1305500,when you can get printed art panels?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1305500,1306760,So what I've done
RUI1k-KHXNk,1308830,1312370,"is I got some artwork from my friend, Jasmine,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1312370,1313420,who's an artist.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1313420,1314720,She does prints now.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1314720,1316120,So I got one of her prints.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1316120,1317670,I have another one in my bedroom.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1317670,1320140,And I got it printed onto fabric
RUI1k-KHXNk,1320140,1322000,using dye-sublimation printing.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1322000,1324230,- That is a very colorful art.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1324230,1325630,"- [James] Well, it's mostly orange."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1325630,1326760,- [Linus] That's really not what I meant.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1326760,1328510,So do I get to listen to it now?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1328510,1330710,"- No, we have to do the ARC Genesis set up."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1330710,1332500,- Are you ready for ARC Genesis?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1332500,1334360,"- [James] Yeah, pretty sure this gives you a live feed."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1334360,1335230,"- Oh, really?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1335230,1336063,"From position one,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1336063,1337590,position the microphone at ear level
RUI1k-KHXNk,1337590,1339669,"and point it towards the ceiling, okay."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1339670,1340769,"- Okay, now once you hit start."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1340769,1342120,"(speakers playing abruptly) - Whoa, hi, how are you doing?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1342120,1343796,- We should actually get out of the way.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1343796,1346213,"- Oh, I'm getting down."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1348278,1350065,- [James] Gotta be quiet.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1350065,1351174,"- Everybody, shut up!"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1351175,1354925,(speakers making sharp tone)
RUI1k-KHXNk,1358967,1360195,- [James] That's some room rattle on that one.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1360195,1361330,- Mhmm.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1361330,1362929,I think this little bump right here
RUI1k-KHXNk,1362930,1363860,"is actually me saying,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1363860,1366280,"mhmm, to you when the sub was running,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1366280,1368190,because the other one didn't have anything
RUI1k-KHXNk,1368190,1370090,above one kilohertz for the subwoofer.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1371430,1372707,This is super cool.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1372707,1375600,(speakers making sharp tone)
RUI1k-KHXNk,1375600,1377280,"Okay, it says it's done."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1377280,1379320,Please wait for your correction curves.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1379320,1381490,It's ready to upload corrections to your device.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1381490,1384920,"So I click upload now, I guess."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1384920,1387300,"Oh, we should probably swap out your SHIELD before we do."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1387300,1388810,"- Sure. - That's the last piece, okay."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1388810,1390660,"- Well, also don't forget about the floor."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1390660,1391493,"- Oh, right, right, right, okay."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1391493,1393420,"You get the SHIELD, I got this, I got this."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1393420,1394730,"This is gonna be really high effort,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1394730,1396500,'cause I know James is staying here a long time.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1396500,1397920,This self-adhesive can be applied
RUI1k-KHXNk,1397920,1400060,"to all smooth, clean and dry surfaces."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1400060,1401560,"I dunno, let's eyeball it."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1401560,1404510,"Oh, in that case, it's not really long enough."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1404510,1405343,"Realistically,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1405343,1406176,"yeah, that'll reach. - What about over here?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1406176,1407070,- [Linus] I don't really care though.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1407070,1408759,"- [James] Honestly, whatever, man."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1408760,1410860,"At this point, this is a waste of $20, so."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1412260,1414253,- [Linus] This is not going very well.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1416110,1418110,"- [James] Oh no, it folded in on itself."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1419270,1421070,"- [Linus] Okay, here, hold on, hold on, I got it."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1421070,1423230,"Dbrand, are you proud of me yet?"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1423230,1424850,"- [James] Oh god, I can see why they want"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1424850,1426332,the surface to be clean.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1426332,1428970,"- There, ah. - There you go."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1428970,1431200,"- [Linus] All right, enjoy, James."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1431200,1432529,Totally not noticeable.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1432530,1434320,- [James] Is that worse than the speaker wire?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1434320,1435980,- [Linus] (laughs) I think so.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1435980,1437333,- [David] I think you have to leave it though.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1437333,1439548,- [Linus And David] Yeah!
RUI1k-KHXNk,1439548,1441610,- [James] And we're back to square one.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1441610,1443170,- [Linus] And the worst part
RUI1k-KHXNk,1443170,1446660,is that I taped down the wires right under the chair.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1446660,1448420,- [James] Right under the leg?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1448420,1449387,- [Linus] It's like sitting on it (laughing).
RUI1k-KHXNk,1449387,1450346,- [James] You son of a (beep).
RUI1k-KHXNk,1450346,1452768,(Linus laughing)
RUI1k-KHXNk,1452769,1454111,- What are you gonna do?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1454111,1455657,Ask for a refund?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1455657,1459610,"- [James] Oh my god, this is getting so bad."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1459610,1460480,"- [Linus] Oh my god,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1460480,1462840,this feels like an infomercial fails level.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1462840,1464760,Like this is awesome.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1464760,1466530,- [James] I'm gonna wrap you in this
RUI1k-KHXNk,1466530,1468260,for a prank one day. - [Linus] No way.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1468260,1469440,"Okay, I'm ready."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1469440,1470360,Are you ready?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1470360,1472033,Who gets your daughter's pee spot here?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1472033,1474390,"- [James] Hey, that's maybe animal pee."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1474390,1477670,"- Ah, I'm totally gonna be that guy"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1477670,1480050,that goes into someone else's home
RUI1k-KHXNk,1480050,1482120,"and takes the alpha listening spot,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1482120,1483370,right in the dead center.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1485690,1487129,And I just dropped a silent fart
RUI1k-KHXNk,1487130,1488609,onto your alpha listening spot.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1488609,1491192,(upbeat music)
RUI1k-KHXNk,1492800,1494100,That is night and day.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1494100,1496429,- Do you feel like the sub is super localized?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1496430,1498319,"- No, you probably do."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1498319,1499840,- I'm right beside it. - Because you can literally
RUI1k-KHXNk,1499840,1501029,feel the vibration of it.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1501030,1502360,"One thing I did notice though,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1502360,1504110,is there's only so much
RUI1k-KHXNk,1504110,1507120,that your ARC calibration can do.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1507120,1508210,- Exactly.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1508210,1510220,- There's still a void over there.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1510220,1511539,- It's the cherry on top.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1511540,1513180,It's not gonna change your world.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1513180,1514840,"- No, but it's better."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1514840,1515789,What about your impressions?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1515790,1517000,This is your setup.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1517000,1518044,"- Well, let me sit there."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1518044,1519559,- (sighs) You piece of (beep).
RUI1k-KHXNk,1519559,1522142,(upbeat music)
RUI1k-KHXNk,1523930,1527330,- I wanna see some intelligibility of dialogue.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1527330,1529100,"- Wait, you're not gonna give music impressions"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1529100,1529933,other than that?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1529933,1530950,- I'm not ready to.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1530950,1533422,I need to audition it for longer than that.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1533422,1536000,(bass rumbling)
RUI1k-KHXNk,1536000,1537253,That sounds awesome!
RUI1k-KHXNk,1538640,1541200,- This is like neighbors complaining level though.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1541200,1544940,"- The sound stage, I can pinpoint all the sounds."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1544940,1547490,"Like when he stepped on that cello and broke it,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1547490,1549540,it was like right in front of me.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1549540,1552240,"I can't wipe the smile from my face, this is so sweet."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1552240,1554110,"- Yeah, it's night and day, man."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1554110,1556440,"Any regrets about spending $2,700"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1556440,1558059,of your budget on the receiver?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1558060,1560680,"- Not yet, but a receiver is the type of thing you like,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1560680,1563680,"you learn about over time, the quirks and stuff."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1563680,1565040,But right now I'm very happy.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1565040,1567020,"It looks awesome, it sounds awesome."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1567020,1570410,And it's gonna be future proof enough for me for many years.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1570410,1573740,"- The way James flips his computer over to his TV for now,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1573740,1575340,"is just by moving the cable,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1575340,1577299,because he's only got a single HDMI output.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1577300,1579440,"But what you'll do in the future then,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1579440,1581779,"is you'll just go display port out to a new monitor,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1581780,1583410,'cause this one doesn't have display port.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1583410,1586200,And then you'll go HDMI out to your receiver.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1586200,1589399,And then you can just switch the input and boom.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1589400,1590680,Now we're ready with the gaming PC.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1590680,1592300,"- [James] Hold on, I need to be able"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1592300,1594610,to see this from my wired keyboard over there.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1594610,1596140,- [Linus] You do? Where's your wireless one?
RUI1k-KHXNk,1596140,1597424,- In my storage locker.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1597424,1598340,- Oh.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1598340,1600360,- I haven't couch gamed in a long time.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1600360,1602830,"- [Linus] Okay, this is co-op gaming."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1602830,1604049,"- [James] Oh, it looks fantastic."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1604050,1605590,- [Linus] How's the sound? - High fidelity.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1605590,1606690,- [Linus] So that's pretty much it.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1606690,1607990,"Once you move into the new place,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1607990,1609730,you can get the wireless keyboard mouse out.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1609730,1612070,"You'll have gaming, movies, music,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1612070,1614549,"everything freaking covered, it's sick."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1614550,1616240,"- [James] I'm very happy, it sound amazing."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1616240,1619070,"- I saw your setup and I was like, ""Wait a minute."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1619070,1622380,"We're upgrading something that is already freaking amazing?"""
RUI1k-KHXNk,1622380,1625440,But then I tried it and it blew chunks.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1625440,1626399,And now it's awesome.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1626400,1628540,"Man, now you didn't totally waste your money"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1628540,1630330,"on these speakers, because."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1630330,1631940,- Those weren't as expensive as you would've thought.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1631940,1633820,"Marketplace, baby. - Oh."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1633820,1634899,"- My stuff's all used, all the time."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1634900,1637030,This was the first new stuff I've ever had.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1637030,1639180,"- [Linus] And yet when I give you a budget,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1639180,1640430,you go and buy a bunch of stuff brand new.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1640430,1641830,I see how it works.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1641830,1643080,"Or rather, Intel did."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1643080,1645330,"So thanks, again, to Intel for sponsoring"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1645330,1648880,Extreme Tech Upgrade: James Edition.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1648880,1650600,"We will see you guys at the next one,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1650600,1652370,which I believe is going to be.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1652370,1653203,- Maybe Alex.
RUI1k-KHXNk,1653203,1655650,"- Oh, it might be, the one and only, Alex Clark."
RUI1k-KHXNk,1655650,1657650,"If you guys are looking for another video to watch,"
RUI1k-KHXNk,1657650,1659130,make sure that you guys check
RUI1k-KHXNk,1659130,1661170,out our previous Intel Extreme Tech Upgrades
