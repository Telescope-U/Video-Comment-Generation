23yRscqeyKA,80,6640,my main computer is this 12.9 inch ipad  pro now this is a 2021 model it has the
23yRscqeyKA,6640,11920,m1 chip with two terabytes of internal  storage it is an absolute beast and i'll
23yRscqeyKA,11920,17600,go over why i use that model in just a  bit but i use this ipad for everything
23yRscqeyKA,17600,22640,it is my main computer whether it's  doing work tasks like email research
23yRscqeyKA,22640,29119,project management any of that kind of  thing or personal stuff like writing a  grocery list or
23yRscqeyKA,29119,34399,watching a movie or reading a book it's  all done from this ipad so this video is
23yRscqeyKA,34399,41360,all about all the apps widgets  automation shortcuts that are on this  ipad i'm going to go over it all
23yRscqeyKA,41360,47360,but first my thanks to serfshark for  sponsoring this video i made a video  talking about focus modes and how i use
23yRscqeyKA,47360,52399,them to set custom home screen pages  depending on the context that i am in
23yRscqeyKA,52399,59280,this allows me to have just one home  screen but it changes depending on what  i'm working on i have a work and
23yRscqeyKA,59280,66799,entertainment page these are my main  home screens and balance between having  widgets and apps on them whatever mode i
23yRscqeyKA,66799,74159,am in the home screen should reflect  that so if it's work twitter should be  tucked away we will go over what is on
23yRscqeyKA,74159,79360,these pages in just a bit let's start by  talking about the dock though the dock
23yRscqeyKA,79360,86080,holds apps and shortcuts i want to  access from no matter what focus mode is  active if you turn off the feature that
23yRscqeyKA,86080,94159,shows recent apps in the dock you can  actually put more apps in the dock on  the 12.9 inch ipad pro that's up to 20
23yRscqeyKA,94159,100320,apps plus the app library icon  files is the first app up i get asked
23yRscqeyKA,100320,105840,why i don't use third-party file  management apps a lot and that's because  files is baked into the system it would
23yRscqeyKA,105840,111360,be like trying to replace finder on the  mac  with ipad os 15 files seems to have
23yRscqeyKA,111360,118320,fixed a lot of its long-standing bugs  and feels a lot more stable but it's  still not perfect a lot of things we
23yRscqeyKA,118320,125520,take for granted in finder are still  missing personally i use icloud storage  for all my document management i was
23yRscqeyKA,125520,131440,already paying for it for device and  photo backups so it just makes sense to  have one less subscription to manage and
23yRscqeyKA,131440,137840,honestly it works really well under the  more button in the files app there is a  connect to server button this is
23yRscqeyKA,137840,145040,built-in smb support for connecting to  shared network folders i use this for  moving stuff to my nas i'm going to make
23yRscqeyKA,145040,152400,a dedicated video about this in the  future but i just set up a 60 terabyte  navs for backups archives file
23yRscqeyKA,152400,159599,management and large projects  safari is another app i get asked why i  don't use a third party alternative it
23yRscqeyKA,159599,166879,mostly revolves around features that  safari does that others don't things  like safari extensions tab groups and
23yRscqeyKA,166879,173599,shortcut actions  safari extensions have been a huge  feature for me with ipad os 15. i
23yRscqeyKA,173599,178800,already did a whole video about safari  extensions but here are just a few of my  favorites
23yRscqeyKA,178800,185360,total refresh is an incredibly useful  utility if you have a safari window that  gets kicked out of memory and you want
23yRscqeyKA,185360,192480,to bring everything back up quickly with  one button push it will reload all of  your tabs vidimote gives you a ton of
23yRscqeyKA,192480,198879,controls over videos playing through  safari options like speed up playback or  forced picture in picture mode are
23yRscqeyKA,198879,203920,really nice to have highlighter is great  for marking up websites for research
23yRscqeyKA,203920,210720,enable this extension and select text on  a page these highlights then stay even  if you close that page and come back to
23yRscqeyKA,210720,218799,it x search is great for searching  through websites in the search bar i can  type yt then type ipad home screen it'll
23yRscqeyKA,218799,225920,bring up the youtube search results for  ipad home screen you can set this up  with other sites like twitter amazon
23yRscqeyKA,225920,231599,imdb and so many more this video is  sponsored by surfshark having a vpn
23yRscqeyKA,231599,238159,nowadays is just smart when you connect  to something like a public wi-fi you  have no idea who else is on there and
23yRscqeyKA,238159,244720,trust me when i say this because i used  to simulate it when i had a network  admin job it's really easy to snoop on
23yRscqeyKA,244720,250640,other people's network traffic when  you're connected to the same wi-fi  network it's just it's super easy and
23yRscqeyKA,250640,255840,having a vpn can protect your data  surfshark is my personal favorite vpn
23yRscqeyKA,255840,262320,sponsorship aside it has a reliable fast  connection so when i start it up i know  it's going to connect quickly and it's
23yRscqeyKA,262320,267919,not going to be throttling my bandwidth  slowing down my connection to the  internet it also allows me to pick which
23yRscqeyKA,267919,273280,server i want to connect to in which  country this is handy for checking out  other streaming services and what
23yRscqeyKA,273280,279360,content they have to offer but most  importantly i know my data is safe  having a vpn on your computer is just
23yRscqeyKA,279360,286160,like having good hygiene it's something  everyone desperately needs to have with  surfshark there is no device limits so
23yRscqeyKA,286160,292560,you can connect phones tablets laptops  desktops whatever you want you can  connect it all check out surfshark today
23yRscqeyKA,292560,298240,i'm going to put a link in the  description below if you use that link  you can get 83 off in an extra three
23yRscqeyKA,298240,304880,months for free that's a really good  deal my thanks to surfshark for  sponsoring this video i've been using
23yRscqeyKA,304880,311440,the built-in mail app for email it's  really nothing special and i really do  hope apple gives it some much needed
23yRscqeyKA,311440,318560,attention but i've been using a web  service called sanebox to filter all of  my incoming mail sanebox watches your
23yRscqeyKA,318560,325680,email and lets you pick where new emails  from specific senders end up but it also  has some smarts behind it so it knows to
23yRscqeyKA,325680,333280,place newsletters in the news folders or  receipts in the receipt folders or  non-important email in the later folder
23yRscqeyKA,333280,340080,with samebox important stuff still goes  to the inbox though i use the vip  feature in mail to highlight messages
23yRscqeyKA,340080,345120,from certain people i work with this way  really important messages stand out sane
23yRscqeyKA,345120,352080,black hole is the real power of sanebox  anything from a sender i put in this  folder always goes here and it gets
23yRscqeyKA,352080,359199,marked as read so any newsletters i  didn't sign up for marketing emails from  companies i won't work with and a lot
23yRscqeyKA,359199,365759,more get dumped here this way i never  see those emails and i never have to  interact with them this makes the cost
23yRscqeyKA,365759,370880,of sanebox worth it alone you can also  add whole domains through their web
23yRscqeyKA,370880,376639,portal to the same black hole folder  this is great if you have some really  spammy companies emailing you saying
23yRscqeyKA,376639,384479,tomorrow will store an email until  tomorrow and will then add it back into  my inbox this is basically the boomerang
23yRscqeyKA,384479,390479,feature a lot of email apps have you can  configure different folders for  different date ranges but usually just
23yRscqeyKA,390479,397120,one day works for me one feature i would  like to see mail get is the share sheet  this way i could send messages to other
23yRscqeyKA,397120,402400,apps but to get around this you can drag  and drop content from mail to other apps
23yRscqeyKA,402400,409120,i do this a lot with the next app to  create tasks things is my task manager  and where i run my business and to an
23yRscqeyKA,409120,414639,extent my life out of i have all the  parts of my life broken up into areas
23yRscqeyKA,414639,421280,then projects for big multi-step things  i work on like videos  with things i have a centralized place
23yRscqeyKA,421280,426960,to see what i need to do in a given day  and what i need to do in upcoming days
23yRscqeyKA,426960,433280,i'll talk in a bit about how their new  widget has been helping me with this  throughout the day i add tasks to the
23yRscqeyKA,433280,439440,inbox at the end of the day i go through  and file these tasks in the right area  or project we'll give them due dates or
23yRscqeyKA,439440,445039,tags or any notes if necessary things  recently updated to support markdown in
23yRscqeyKA,445039,451199,the notes field i've been using this a  lot to add links and formatted notes to  specific tasks if you're the kind of
23yRscqeyKA,451199,456800,person that uses lists to organize tasks  things will be a great app for you
23yRscqeyKA,456800,463680,if i had a dollar for every calendar app  on the app store i've tried i would have  a lot of dollars but the only one that
23yRscqeyKA,463680,470800,ever seems to click for me is  fantastical i use fantastical and split  view with things a lot the one third
23yRscqeyKA,470800,477280,view of fantastical is perfect for how i  want to see my calendar appointments i  actually have a shortcut that builds the
23yRscqeyKA,477280,484639,split view window for me i run this from  spotlight a lot to get into this  configuration i've been asked why i use
23yRscqeyKA,484639,490000,both things and fantastical things is  for tasks and stuff i need to do
23yRscqeyKA,490000,496960,fantastical is for appointments meetings  going out to dinner with friends that  sort of thing fantastic hell's natural
23yRscqeyKA,496960,503440,language input is a pretty important  feature for adding events quickly  calendar sets are also a nice feature if
23yRscqeyKA,503440,508479,you want to filter to a certain view  fantastical's ui is beautiful and well
23yRscqeyKA,508479,515360,laid out a lot of calendar apps  prioritize the iphone over the ipad and  the ipad ends up having a lot of wasted
23yRscqeyKA,515360,520800,space or doesn't work well in split view  that's not the case with fantastical
23yRscqeyKA,520800,528640,another app i live out of on my ipad is  drafts drafts is a text editor with  support for syntax like markdown task
23yRscqeyKA,528640,536320,paper and even javascript but i treat  drafts like a notebook in that i write  everything down in it this is stuff like
23yRscqeyKA,536320,542959,note taking research long form writing  thoughts on things i should look into  and so much more
23yRscqeyKA,542959,549360,if i have something i need to remember  for the future i write it here  everything goes into drafts i can't
23yRscqeyKA,549360,556800,underscore that enough i use the tags  and workspaces feature to organize all  the content in the app then the keyboard
23yRscqeyKA,556800,562560,shortcut command shift f to quickly open  a draft drafts also has the ability for
23yRscqeyKA,562560,568640,custom actions these actions allow you  to create automations to do things with  the text and drafts you could do things
23yRscqeyKA,568640,576399,like change the formatting send the text  to another app or even append to another  draft last year drafts got support for
23yRscqeyKA,576399,583120,custom themes i actually wrote my own  custom one and i called it dark knight  it's available via drafts website along
23yRscqeyKA,583120,589839,with a lot of others  my favorite feature drafts recently got  though is wiki style linking
23yRscqeyKA,589839,596560,you've probably seen this in other text  editing apps like obsidian if you type  two open brackets you'll get a drop down
23yRscqeyKA,596560,601680,window start typing the draft name and  then select a draft this will embed a
23yRscqeyKA,601680,609120,link in your current draft to the draft  you just selected you can then tap on  that link to jump to that draft i
23yRscqeyKA,609120,615680,created a document called launchpad this  is a draft that has links to everything  i'm working on this gives me a dashboard
23yRscqeyKA,615680,622959,view i check every morning and lets me  see a nice layout of everything i'm  working on it's also a convenient way to
23yRscqeyKA,622959,630560,just jump into a draft quickly the next  app in the dock isn't an app but a  shortcut this is a one action shortcut
23yRscqeyKA,630560,637360,that jumps into my launchpad draft i  keep this in my dock so no matter what  mode my ipad is in i can quickly tap on
23yRscqeyKA,637360,644640,it and get to my dashboard for the  shortcuts that are in my dock i use the  mac stories icon pack when adding a
23yRscqeyKA,644640,650880,shortcut to the home screen just tap the  image and pick choose file then browse  the files app and select the image you
23yRscqeyKA,650880,656720,want the next icon is also a shortcut  this one is called capture cut capture
23yRscqeyKA,656720,663760,cut is a bunch of different shortcuts  i've used for years rolled into one this  allows me to quickly add a new note task
23yRscqeyKA,663760,669279,or event to the corresponding app but it  uses the new action get on screen
23yRscqeyKA,669279,677279,content to see if there's anything on  screen it can link to if there is it  will add a link to the new note or task
23yRscqeyKA,677279,683920,it also works with an airtable database  i have set up for storing apps i want to  check out and cover here on the channel
23yRscqeyKA,683920,690480,capture cut lives in my docs so i can  use it at any mode my ipad is in whether  it's in tablet mode or i have a keyboard
23yRscqeyKA,690480,695600,attached  also with the get on-screen content  action this is the best way to trigger
23yRscqeyKA,695600,701760,it this shortcut is all about getting  what's in my head or what's on screen  into the appropriate app quickly the
23yRscqeyKA,701760,708880,next app is airtable airtable is a  database service that is great at  storing and linking data together the
23yRscqeyKA,708880,713920,airtable app unfortunately is not great  on the ipad what i did is use the add to
23yRscqeyKA,713920,718959,home screen feature in safari and turn  the airtable web page into a web app
23yRscqeyKA,718959,724240,this works really well on the ipad i use  airtable to track all of my active video
23yRscqeyKA,724240,731360,projects and ideas i have it laid out  into a kanban system for tracking the  status of each video i also have a
23yRscqeyKA,731360,737279,production calendar so i can see when  i'm working on everything and when it's  due from there i have a separate page
23yRscqeyKA,737279,743920,for tracking sponsorships for videos i  can then link a video and a sponsorship  together this gives me a central place
23yRscqeyKA,743920,749839,to keep an eye on all my videos and make  sure i'm not missing anything the reason  i made this is because i messed up
23yRscqeyKA,749839,756639,something really bad a few months ago  and i wanted to make sure it never  happened again airtable is also a good
23yRscqeyKA,756639,763519,collaborative system as well if you've  seen any what's on my ipad videos on  youtube before you've probably heard of
23yRscqeyKA,763519,770079,this next app that's good notes good  notes is a handwriting and note-taking  app most of the notes that i take are
23yRscqeyKA,770079,777360,typed through drafts i've got terrible  handwriting plus i'm just faster at  typing but i use goodnotes for two key
23yRscqeyKA,777360,784639,things the first one is journaling now  i'm not going to get all productivity  guru on you and talk about how you must
23yRscqeyKA,784639,790320,journal to be productive  for me though i find journaling a great  way to start my day i reflect on the
23yRscqeyKA,790320,797040,previous day and come up with a plan on  how i'm going to tackle all the tasks i  need to do today this is one area where
23yRscqeyKA,797040,804160,i find handwriting just to be better  than typing honestly i'm not really sure  why but i've tried typing this out and i
23yRscqeyKA,804160,810800,just like handwriting it better the  second use case is for working out a  problem or project a lot of times i get
23yRscqeyKA,810800,815920,ideas for things but the idea isn't all  there i use goodnotes to sketch out or
23yRscqeyKA,815920,823040,write out the idea and oftentimes this  helps me fill in the missing pieces  this is a very good use of the apple
23yRscqeyKA,823040,828800,pencil for people like me that don't  draw or paint  i pair this with the paper like and full
23yRscqeyKA,828800,836000,disclosure they are a channel sponsor  and this pairing gives me a good digital  notebook you get that pencil and paper
23yRscqeyKA,836000,842079,feeling from the paper like and the  apple pencil goodnotes does a great job  at being a place where all of your
23yRscqeyKA,842079,847680,digital notebooks can live  net newswire is my rss reader of choice
23yRscqeyKA,847680,854959,it's a great app what i like about it is  all the gesture support on the ipad and  the iphone but the real power for me
23yRscqeyKA,854959,862160,when it comes to rss is a feedband  feedband is a service i pay for and i  use it to gather all of my rss feeds
23yRscqeyKA,862160,867519,then i just log into feedbin through  netnewswire on any device but feedbin
23yRscqeyKA,867519,872800,has support for not just rss feeds but  also newsletters they give you an email
23yRscqeyKA,872800,880399,address you can use when signing up for  a newsletter so it goes to your rss  reader instead of your email inbox i
23yRscqeyKA,880399,885920,love this feature  net newswire and feedband together are a  powerful combination for capturing and
23yRscqeyKA,885920,891519,going through news blogs newsletters and  more good links is a read it later app
23yRscqeyKA,891519,898399,but i use it for much more than just  that any interesting link i come across  gets added here this can be products i
23yRscqeyKA,898399,905199,want to cover for the channel  interesting automations people are doing  whatever good links has a great tagging
23yRscqeyKA,905199,911680,system for organizing all of this  content the next two are pretty  self-explanatory messages and music are
23yRscqeyKA,911680,917519,very popular built-in apps that i use  for almost five years i edited every
23yRscqeyKA,917519,922639,video on this channel using my ipad and  lumafusion i recently moved my core
23yRscqeyKA,922639,929360,video editing back to the mac but i'm  using lumafusion for some upcoming  projects i'm going to be starting a
23yRscqeyKA,929360,934880,series of shorts around tips and tricks  for devices in the apple ecosystem all
23yRscqeyKA,934880,942160,of those will be edited in lumafusion so  that way i can keep a foot in both  worlds lumafusion is a solid video
23yRscqeyKA,942160,948480,editor if you're looking to tackle the  basics i unfortunately hit a wall with  it and needed to move my bigger projects
23yRscqeyKA,948480,954240,though to final cut but if you're  starting out and want to learn or are  spinning up a youtube channel lumafusion
23yRscqeyKA,954240,961040,is a great place to start lightroom is  where i do all of my photo editing i  like that it syncs between my iphone
23yRscqeyKA,961040,968160,ipad and mac a vast majority of its  tools are available on all three  platforms this last year lightroom got
23yRscqeyKA,968160,975120,the ability to auto generate mass based  on the subject or the sky and this is  such a cool feature it saves me a ton of
23yRscqeyKA,975120,981920,time when i want to make the subject pop  or bring down the highlights in the sky  i've tried other photo editing apps on
23yRscqeyKA,981920,988560,the ipad and while they are good  lightroom checks all the boxes i need  all the images you see as wallpapers on
23yRscqeyKA,988560,993920,my devices were edited in lightroom the  way i pay for lightroom also includes
23yRscqeyKA,993920,1000720,photoshop when photoshop launched on the  ipad it was pretty disappointing a lot  of its key features were missing and a
23yRscqeyKA,1000720,1006720,lot still are  photoshop also has the feature to detect  objects and auto-generate masks based on
23yRscqeyKA,1006720,1012240,those and it saves me a ton of time when  i'm wanting to add text behind an image
23yRscqeyKA,1012240,1018800,or a subject or something like that  while affinity photo may be a more  full-featured photoshop editor i think
23yRscqeyKA,1018800,1025918,photoshop is a lot easier if you don't  need a lot of those complex features the  next app is another shortcut this uses
23yRscqeyKA,1025918,1031839,the open action to launch my calculator  app of choice pcalc in slide over there
23yRscqeyKA,1031839,1037600,is an option in this action that forces  the app to open and slide over  calculator apps and a few other app
23yRscqeyKA,1037600,1042959,types have always struggled on the ipad  because of the big full screen canvas on
23yRscqeyKA,1042959,1050480,the mac you could have them in small  windows but on the ipad when you open  the app up it opens in full screen so i
23yRscqeyKA,1050480,1057760,have a few shortcuts that i run from  spotlight or in pcalc's case the dock  that opened the app in slide over these
23yRscqeyKA,1057760,1064160,apps have a much better ui layout in  slide over i just wish there was a way  you could pen certain apps to always
23yRscqeyKA,1064160,1070960,open in slide over without the need for  shortcuts yoink is another app i've  talked about a lot in a lot of different
23yRscqeyKA,1070960,1076240,contexts it's probably the single most  used app i use every day
23yRscqeyKA,1076240,1081440,but i constantly change how i use it it  recently got a feature to act as a true
23yRscqeyKA,1081440,1088400,clipboard manager so in the app you can  hit the plus button select monitor  clipboard and then pick a duration this
23yRscqeyKA,1088400,1093840,will open a picture-in-picture window so  the app can stay active i just hide it
23yRscqeyKA,1093840,1101120,in a corner and let it do its thing as  you copy stuff it'll be added to yoink  this is incredibly useful feature that i
23yRscqeyKA,1101120,1107039,can't live without now the next app i've  already talked about using a bit and  that's shortcuts for those that aren't
23yRscqeyKA,1107039,1112720,aware shortcuts is a built-in app on ios  ipad os and now the mac for building
23yRscqeyKA,1112720,1120160,custom automation utilities this uses  block based programming so you can just  drag and drop actions into the editor
23yRscqeyKA,1120160,1125520,i've made a few videos about building  shortcuts that i'll link to but i'm  going to be making more in the future so
23yRscqeyKA,1125520,1131840,be sure to subscribe i get asked a lot  about where i get my wallpapers from  they are all photos i've taken and
23yRscqeyKA,1131840,1136960,edited myself i've started selling these  as a wallpaper pack this includes all
23yRscqeyKA,1136960,1143919,the landscape photos you've seen in the  past that have been my wallpapers  there's 27 high resolution photos in
23yRscqeyKA,1143919,1151360,this pack each photo has three different  versions for different aspect ratios so  the ipad the iphone and the mac are all
23yRscqeyKA,1151360,1158720,covered the images are extremely high  resolution though so you can fit them on  any device and they will still look good
23yRscqeyKA,1158720,1164160,there will be a link in the description  below to where you can find them for the  first two weeks after this video is
23yRscqeyKA,1164160,1170320,published you can get the whole pack for  seven dollars after that two weeks they  will be ten dollars
23yRscqeyKA,1170320,1175919,i have two home pages the first of the  two is dedicated to work this has apps
23yRscqeyKA,1175919,1182720,and widgets that i use throughout my day  i do have other apps i use for work  besides these but between the dock and
23yRscqeyKA,1182720,1187840,this page it covers a majority of them  the first widget on this home screen is
23yRscqeyKA,1187840,1195120,fantastical the developers did a great  job with their widget showing a dense  amount of information for any given size
23yRscqeyKA,1195120,1202159,of widget this gives me the date plus  upcoming calendar events i have my  production calendar from airtable sync
23yRscqeyKA,1202159,1209600,with my calendar so i can see what  project i'm working on for that day  with ipad os 15 we got a new widget size
23yRscqeyKA,1209600,1215440,that is exclusive to the ipad that's the  xl widget the app things it has one of
23yRscqeyKA,1215440,1221600,my favorite uses of this size the widget  i use is the up next one this shows what
23yRscqeyKA,1221600,1228559,is due today and the next three days  this gives me a good view of what i need  to be working on and what i need to be
23yRscqeyKA,1228559,1234400,thinking about i find having a view that  shows me all of my upcoming tasks  extremely helpful
23yRscqeyKA,1234400,1241039,if you haven't noticed yet i'm a planner  and like to have all my important  information available at a glance
23yRscqeyKA,1241039,1247280,timery is the app i use for time  tracking time tracking isn't something i  think everyone needs to do but if you're
23yRscqeyKA,1247280,1252720,curious about how you spend your time or  self-employed in some fashion i highly
23yRscqeyKA,1252720,1258000,recommend it timery is an app that hooks  into the service toggle now i use the
23yRscqeyKA,1258000,1263280,free version of toggle but i pay for  timery i usually overestimate how long a
23yRscqeyKA,1263280,1271039,task takes me and i find time tracking  to help make those estimates when i plan  my week out to be more on target with
23yRscqeyKA,1271039,1276240,timery i use two different widgets on my  work home screen the first widget is a
23yRscqeyKA,1276240,1281280,stack for those that are unaware you can  stack multiple widgets on top of each  other
23yRscqeyKA,1281280,1288080,this is two summary report widgets from  timery the first one shows what i've  been working on for the day the second
23yRscqeyKA,1288080,1293919,one shows what i've been working on for  the week  this widget does a great job at showing  you how you've spent your time for a
23yRscqeyKA,1293919,1301520,given period but you can also use  filters like tags clients and projects  to get more granular if you want the
23yRscqeyKA,1301520,1308000,next widget is the save timers widget  from timery this allows you to set  pre-configured timers so you can just
23yRscqeyKA,1308000,1314799,start running them from a single tap so  i have projects and tags configured like  video projects with the tag of filming
23yRscqeyKA,1314799,1319840,this allows me to quickly start that  timer  in this widget settings i have it set to
23yRscqeyKA,1319840,1324960,show the current timer that is running i  also have the widget in compact mode so
23yRscqeyKA,1324960,1330320,i can fit more timers on the widget if  you do anything with or want to try time
23yRscqeyKA,1330320,1337679,tracking check out timery it has a ton  of different widgets and information and  it works as a great front end for toggle
23yRscqeyKA,1337679,1344640,the shortcuts widget is the only widget  that is interactive meaning you can tap  on it trigger an action and it doesn't
23yRscqeyKA,1344640,1350159,open the app most of the time i trigger  shortcuts from spotlight i even created
23yRscqeyKA,1350159,1355520,keyboard text replacement shortcuts to  quickly launch some but i wanted my most
23yRscqeyKA,1355520,1360720,used shortcuts quickly accessible even  when i don't have a keyboard attached so
23yRscqeyKA,1360720,1367360,that's what this widget does  the first shortcut is called mode cut  this lets me pick from a list of focus
23yRscqeyKA,1367360,1374080,modes it will then switch to that focus  mode and depending on the focus trigger  further actions like starting or
23yRscqeyKA,1374080,1380000,stopping time tracking the next shortcut  is reset focus this sets my focus to my
23yRscqeyKA,1380000,1385440,personal mode which i see as my default  state from my device it also shuts off
23yRscqeyKA,1385440,1392320,any time tracking that was running  then there is audio cut this is my big  shortcut that hooks into apple music
23yRscqeyKA,1392320,1397440,overcast my podcast player and the new  system-wide background noise feature
23yRscqeyKA,1397440,1403280,when running the shortcut i get a menu  to pick from all sorts of different  options i found this to be a quick way
23yRscqeyKA,1403280,1409039,to get different kinds of audio playing  this is great from when i'm working and  i want to switch between music and
23yRscqeyKA,1409039,1414400,background noises or maybe even play a  podcast  i can even throw the audio to my
23yRscqeyKA,1414400,1421679,homepods in my office or kitchen through  this shortcut the next shortcut is  generating links to a draft from well
23yRscqeyKA,1421679,1427679,the drafts app i've been on a kick  lately to get everything linked together  and since drafts is the center of my
23yRscqeyKA,1427679,1434320,digital work this just makes sense when  i run the shortcut it lets me search  through my drafts database for a
23yRscqeyKA,1434320,1440799,specific draft then it gets the link to  that document then it adds it to my  clipboard i can then paste that in a
23yRscqeyKA,1440799,1446159,things project or in my airtable  database next is snippet cut this may
23yRscqeyKA,1446159,1453039,look familiar to long time viewers this  was my clipboard manager but since yarn  became a true clipboard manager i
23yRscqeyKA,1453039,1459840,shifted the focus of this to be a text  snippet manager i use this to store  important information like email address
23yRscqeyKA,1459840,1467520,links to affiliate programs sites  addresses anything else that i need  often this uses the app data jar to
23yRscqeyKA,1467520,1474080,store all of this information on the  backend then the shortcut can access  that information this is super handy to
23yRscqeyKA,1474080,1479840,have all of my important information in  one place so i can quickly add it to my  clipboard and then send it to somebody
23yRscqeyKA,1479840,1486559,or paste it in a document the next  shortcut is money cut this one uses  shortcutify to hook into my expense
23yRscqeyKA,1486559,1493039,tracking airtable database  i use this for income tracking for my  business and expense tracking for taxes
23yRscqeyKA,1493039,1499360,this works really well for the way my  business is set up then we have publish  new video when i have a new video go
23yRscqeyKA,1499360,1506480,live on my channel i run this it pulls  the latest video from my youtube channel  formats it into a blog post then
23yRscqeyKA,1506480,1511840,publishes it to my website it also gives  me the option to tweet about the video
23yRscqeyKA,1511840,1518960,in a pre-formatted tweet but sometimes i  like to make a custom tweet and include  an image or something so i don't always
23yRscqeyKA,1518960,1526559,use this part then the last shortcut is  new video this shortcuts creates an  airtable record for a new video project
23yRscqeyKA,1526559,1533360,a script and drafts and a things project  with all the pre-configured tasks  this just sets the stage for any new
23yRscqeyKA,1533360,1539919,video project that i start and gives me  a standard template to work from to the  right of the shortcuts widget we have
23yRscqeyKA,1539919,1545120,apps the first is textastic this is a  text editor with support for a ton of
23yRscqeyKA,1545120,1552000,different syntax highlighting i use this  for writing some scripts for automations  and editing text files for my website
23yRscqeyKA,1552000,1557760,i'm working on a big overhaul for my  website right now so this has been  clutch
23yRscqeyKA,1557760,1563200,working copy is a get client my website  syncs through git any of my shortcuts
23yRscqeyKA,1563200,1568559,that automate posts for my website use  working copy shortcuts action working
23yRscqeyKA,1568559,1575440,copy does a great job at being a get  client but also supporting key features  like shortcuts i can also drag and drop
23yRscqeyKA,1575440,1580880,files from working copy into textastic  edit them modify them add to them and
23yRscqeyKA,1580880,1587360,then it syncs back to working copy so i  can push the changes  highlights is a pdf viewer i use a ton i
23yRscqeyKA,1587360,1593200,use this to read through a pdf document  and pull out all the important bits i  get a lot of contracts and reviewers
23yRscqeyKA,1593200,1600480,guides i need to go through most of them  have a lot of fluff so i use this to  pull out the key bits so i can come back
23yRscqeyKA,1600480,1607360,and reference just those  mind node is a mind mapping app i've had  mixed feelings about mind mapping over
23yRscqeyKA,1607360,1613600,the years sometimes it felt like  duplicate work other times it was  actually helpful i've stopped mind
23yRscqeyKA,1613600,1620080,mapping video projects altogether i  usually have a big research doc for  every video and this was just duplicate
23yRscqeyKA,1620080,1626240,work but i'm working on a few different  projects right now that have nothing to  do with video and mind mapping has been
23yRscqeyKA,1626240,1632159,really helpful one of them is  redesigning my website i'm using mind  node to map out the different pages and
23yRscqeyKA,1632159,1638559,content if you're somebody that benefits  from seeing your work laid out and  seeing how it all connects maybe give
23yRscqeyKA,1638559,1644480,mind mapping a shot mind note is the  best designed mind mapping app but  there's a ton out there
23yRscqeyKA,1644480,1651440,the other page on my ipad is the  entertainment page this is basically  everything but work stuff i consider
23yRscqeyKA,1651440,1658559,this to be the default page of my ipad  and when my device is in the personal  focus this is the active page
23yRscqeyKA,1658559,1664720,the first widget on this page is carrot  weather carrot weather is one of the  best designed apps on the iphone and
23yRscqeyKA,1664720,1671840,ipad and its widget is extremely  customizable what i like about carrot  weather's forecast widget is it adapts
23yRscqeyKA,1671840,1678399,so you can set it to show things like  the high and low temperature it'll also  show things like rain patterns as well
23yRscqeyKA,1678399,1684880,tv forecast is one of my favorite  non-work apps in the app i add all the  shows that i'm watching and it displays
23yRscqeyKA,1684880,1691840,when the next episode airs the widget  does a good job at showing this  information it sounds simple but with
23yRscqeyKA,1691840,1697440,everything being disconnected on  multiple streaming platforms i find this  helpful so i don't miss something i've
23yRscqeyKA,1697440,1704640,been looking forward to game track is  like tv forecast and its widget is in  the same stack i use this to track
23yRscqeyKA,1704640,1710399,upcoming games i want to play in their  release dates the app itself has  features for organizing games you want
23yRscqeyKA,1710399,1717440,to play and a back catalog  mostly i just use it for tracking  upcoming games the next widget is for
23yRscqeyKA,1717440,1724320,parcel this app tracks and organizes all  of your upcoming deliveries the widget  shows your next package and when it's
23yRscqeyKA,1724320,1730640,arriving i used the app deliveries for  years until i heard the guys on the  connected podcast mention parcel and it
23yRscqeyKA,1730640,1738159,has a feature to automatically add  amazon deliveries to the app i switched  over and haven't looked back that is one
23yRscqeyKA,1738159,1744720,killer feature for me you still have to  manually add fedex ups or any other  delivery company shipping information
23yRscqeyKA,1744720,1751360,but that's easy to do from the share  sheet under parcel there is the good  links widget this shows my latest unread
23yRscqeyKA,1751360,1757919,articles like i talked about i use good  links for storing articles newsletters  links to products i want to check out i
23yRscqeyKA,1757919,1763279,use the widget for when i have some time  to kill and want to check out something  for research it's just a nice visual
23yRscqeyKA,1763279,1769679,reminder of the things that i have  unread next to good links is shortcuts  this is the same setup that is on my
23yRscqeyKA,1769679,1776159,work home screen like i said i use these  shortcuts a lot and want to be able to  access them in any mode the last widget
23yRscqeyKA,1776159,1782240,is the xltv widget apple did a great job  with the tv widget i used my ipad as an
23yRscqeyKA,1782240,1787440,entertainment device a lot especially as  a bedside tv with the tv widget i can
23yRscqeyKA,1787440,1794559,quickly resume any movie or tv show i  was watching except if it's from netflix  because they refuse to support the tv
23yRscqeyKA,1794559,1800080,app like on the work page the personal  page has four apps first is discord i'm
23yRscqeyKA,1800080,1806480,in a couple of discord groups lurking  more than i should i probably should be  a bit more active but it's nice to be
23yRscqeyKA,1806480,1813039,able to jump into a conversation with  fellow computer and automation nerds  tweetbot has become my go-to place for
23yRscqeyKA,1813039,1821120,all things twitter i got super tired of  the explore page and twitter trying to  constantly shove politics down my throat
23yRscqeyKA,1821120,1827200,then when twitter spaces opened up and  just became a slew of crypto scams that  was the straw that broke the camel's
23yRscqeyKA,1827200,1833760,back i switched back to tweetbot to get  rid of both of those issues with  tweetbot i can have a chronological
23yRscqeyKA,1833760,1838960,timeline and have it sync between all of  my devices this is key for the way i use
23yRscqeyKA,1838960,1845600,twitter then next is the biggest  surprise in this whole video  youtube i'm just kidding with you i
23yRscqeyKA,1845600,1851039,watch youtube on my ipad what a shock  overcast is the last app this was the
23yRscqeyKA,1851039,1856960,first app i ever covered on this channel  it's a podcast player i've used for  years i've tried other apps but with
23yRscqeyKA,1856960,1863760,features like voice boost and smart  speed in overcast i haven't been happy  with those other options it's easy to
23yRscqeyKA,1863760,1871200,manage your podcasts drag and drop the  order or swipe to delete them so that's  it that is what's on my ipad for the
23yRscqeyKA,1871200,1877360,year thank you all so much for watching  links to everything i talked about in  the description below if for some reason
23yRscqeyKA,1877360,1883679,i happen to run out of room in the  description because there is a character  limit i will put a link to my website
23yRscqeyKA,1883679,1890080,with all of those links my my website  doesn't have a character character limit  so i could put as many things as i want
23yRscqeyKA,1890080,1895519,on there so you might just see a single  link and i have to go to my website to  find everything else let me know what
23yRscqeyKA,1895519,1902320,your favorite app widget or shortcut on  your ipad is in the comment section  below thank you all so much for watching
