yDAtjQ-8Ygo,399,2000,certain industries in germany have to
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,2000,5040,shut down the economy minister says
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,5040,7440,should there not be enough russian gas
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,7440,9920,come winter russia has already cut
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,9920,11920,supplies delivered through the baltic
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,11920,14320,sea north stream pipeline and could
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,14320,16320,decide to keep the taps completely
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,16320,17199,closed
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,17199,19760,after scheduled maintenance work in july
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,19760,22240,is over meanwhile a discussion is
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,22240,24080,gathering momentum whether germany
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,24080,26320,should extend the lifetime of its
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,26320,30080,remaining nuclear power plants
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,30080,33840,fukushima 2011 an earthquake triggers a
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,33840,36880,tsunami it destroys a nuclear power
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,36880,38079,plant
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,38079,40559,the accident shakes the world leading to
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,40559,43200,fears the same could happen elsewhere
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,43200,45760,the accident also prompts germany to
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,45760,48239,exit from nuclear power earlier than
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,48239,50640,planned
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,51840,53920,as a proponent of the peaceful uses of
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,53920,56879,nuclear energy i want to be very frank
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,56879,58640,the events in japan have changed my
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,58640,61680,opinion on nuclear energy
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,61680,65518,in 2011 17 nuclear power plants were
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,65518,67119,still on the grid
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,67119,70000,now only three remain active they are
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,70000,72000,supposed to close down by the end of the
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,72000,74799,year but the war in ukraine and surging
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,74799,79040,energy prices could affect the timeline
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,79280,82000,since russia's invasion of ukraine the
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,82000,84479,price of natural gas has jumped around
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,84479,87439,80 percent many politicians and business
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,87439,89280,leaders are calling for the nuclear
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,89280,92159,plants to remain in operation so energy
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,92159,94799,supplies are secure
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,94799,96880,in an emergency situation we have to
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,96880,99439,physically secure our energy supply at
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,99439,102159,any time and anywhere
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,102159,104079,but the german chancellor made it clear
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,104079,106159,that there won't be any changes to the
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,106159,108799,nuclear shutdown currently nuclear
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,108799,110560,plants account for six percent of
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,110560,113119,electricity in germany the chancellor
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,113119,115200,says keeping these nuclear plants would
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,115200,117600,have little effect a survey however
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,117600,120000,shows more than 60 percent of the
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,120000,122320,population are in favor of continuing
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,122320,125040,the operation of nuclear plants due to
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,125040,129440,the looming threat of an energy crisis
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,129440,131440,let's get more on this from clemens
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,131440,133200,foost he's the president of the ifo
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,133200,135120,institute one of germany's most renowned
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,135120,136879,economic research institutions welcome
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,136879,138879,back to the program clemens
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,138879,141120,why would it be wise to keep germany's
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,141120,143599,three remaining nuclear power plants in
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,143599,146160,operation
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,147360,150480,we are facing an energy crisis rising
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,150480,152239,energy prices
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,152239,153120,and
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,153120,155680,that means we should use all options to
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,155680,159040,stabilize supply or to increase supply
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,159040,161920,nuclear plants don't produce gas but
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,161920,164640,they may help to keep energy prices
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,164640,166720,electricity prices lower
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,166720,168959,in this situation of high uncertainty
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,168959,173280,it's unwise not to use all options now
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,173280,174879,changing the schedule for the nuclear
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,174879,177519,plants is costly and complicated yes but
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,177519,178959,it's feasible
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,178959,180640,and i think we in this situation we
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,180640,183040,should use all options rather than
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,183040,184800,giving away one without very good
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,184800,186239,reasons
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,186239,187920,let's address some of these some of
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,187920,189680,these issues here i mean we heard uh the
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,189680,192560,chancellor saying everything is geared
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,192560,196000,towards phasing out nuclear power this
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,196000,197920,year when it comes to maintenance
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,197920,199840,intervals when it comes to
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,199840,202560,these fuel rods so how can this be
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,202560,205040,overhauled
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,206159,208799,uh before the crisis a lot of things
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,208799,211120,were geared in directions that have to
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,211120,213120,change now
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,213120,215760,the question is really is it feasible
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,215760,218560,to change the schedule for shutting down
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,218560,221360,the nuclear nuclear plants a lot of
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,221360,223599,experts say yes it is feasible it is
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,223599,225519,complicated but of course the longer we
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,225519,226400,wait
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,226400,229440,the more complicated these things become
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,229440,233840,i i think we should do what's necessary
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,233840,236080,to make it possible to keep these plants
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,236080,237680,open
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,237680,239599,i i think that would be the wiser move
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,239599,241920,rather than saying just because we were
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,241920,244000,on some calls we don't change it we're
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,244000,245920,changing a lot of things at the moment
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,245920,248000,we need the flexibility
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,248000,250480,and we should apply that to new clients
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,250480,252239,as everything else
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,252239,254640,given the fact that uh amid this ukraine
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,254640,256479,war you know long-standing political
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,256479,258639,positions in germany are practically
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,258639,261120,changing overnight i i see that argument
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,261120,262720,nevertheless
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,262720,265199,experts say that getting the necessary
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,265199,266639,fuel elements
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,266639,271520,could take between 12 to 18 months
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,273600,275759,that's wrong as far as i know i'm no
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,275759,278160,engineer but the existing elements can
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,278160,279520,be used a little longer and it's
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,279520,280560,possible
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,280560,282720,to procure new ones as well so it's
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,282720,285120,technically possible to continue running
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,285120,287600,these plants there are papers about that
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,287600,289520,that has delivered one
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,289520,291919,uh maybe not all three plants but maybe
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,291919,294320,it's just two of them but it's possible
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,294320,297199,to do this the question is do we have
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,297199,298639,the political will we should remind
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,298639,300320,ourselves this is not about
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,300320,302240,fundamentally changing the long-term
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,302240,304560,strategy i personally think it would
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,304560,306800,also be good to rethink the long-term
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,306800,308720,strategy about getting out of nuclear
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,308720,311120,but here we are only talking about
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,311120,314240,maybe a year or two or three
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,314240,316800,so just changing the schedule a little
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,316800,318800,clemens host president of the ifo
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,318800,323080,institute thank you for your time
yDAtjQ-8Ygo,329520,331599,you
