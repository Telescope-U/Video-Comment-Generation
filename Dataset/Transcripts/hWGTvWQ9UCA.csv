hWGTvWQ9UCA,80,2000,welcome back to another motobot video
hWGTvWQ9UCA,2000,4240,and you join me in the studio again with
hWGTvWQ9UCA,4240,6240,what has to be the best looking
hWGTvWQ9UCA,6240,8320,adventure bike on the market the africa
hWGTvWQ9UCA,8320,10320,twin adventure sports now i've been
hWGTvWQ9UCA,10320,12000,riding it for the past four or five
hWGTvWQ9UCA,12000,14320,weeks i've thoroughly enjoyed myself and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,14320,15839,so in this video i'll give you my full
hWGTvWQ9UCA,15839,17840,review and tell you why i think it's a
hWGTvWQ9UCA,17840,20050,little bit underrated
hWGTvWQ9UCA,20050,20720,[Music]
hWGTvWQ9UCA,20720,25810,[Applause]

hWGTvWQ9UCA,30820,39040,[Applause]
hWGTvWQ9UCA,41680,43680,but before we get started a massive
hWGTvWQ9UCA,43680,45680,thanks to sizzap for sponsoring this
hWGTvWQ9UCA,45680,47920,video they make this awesome gps
hWGTvWQ9UCA,47920,50000,tracking device which will notify your
hWGTvWQ9UCA,50000,51920,phone if your pride and joy ever gets
hWGTvWQ9UCA,51920,54320,moved or messed with it's super easy to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,54320,56320,install just hook it up to the battery
hWGTvWQ9UCA,56320,58480,install the app and enter the code on
hWGTvWQ9UCA,58480,60800,your device now the device itself is
hWGTvWQ9UCA,60800,62640,pretty small and it comes with a sticky
hWGTvWQ9UCA,62640,64799,pad on the back so it's easy to hide in
hWGTvWQ9UCA,64799,67119,the body work of the bike and it's also
hWGTvWQ9UCA,67119,70400,ip65 waterproof rated now not only does
hWGTvWQ9UCA,70400,72320,it help to protect your bike from theft
hWGTvWQ9UCA,72320,74320,but it has loads of other great features
hWGTvWQ9UCA,74320,76560,on top you can save and share your ride
hWGTvWQ9UCA,76560,78880,history you can create group rides and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,78880,80400,see the location of your mates if they
hWGTvWQ9UCA,80400,82320,get lost it'll tell you about the health
hWGTvWQ9UCA,82320,84400,of your bike's battery and if the device
hWGTvWQ9UCA,84400,86240,gets disconnected and there's crash
hWGTvWQ9UCA,86240,88320,detection too it really is a lot of
hWGTvWQ9UCA,88320,90400,features for the money and it also comes
hWGTvWQ9UCA,90400,92799,with a two year warranty as standard
hWGTvWQ9UCA,92799,94400,there's a link down in the description
hWGTvWQ9UCA,94400,95920,to their full product page where you can
hWGTvWQ9UCA,95920,98799,find all the details as well as a 15
hWGTvWQ9UCA,98799,100720,discount code for my viewers
hWGTvWQ9UCA,100720,102640,now look this idea that it's somewhat
hWGTvWQ9UCA,102640,104880,underrated it kind of stems back from
hWGTvWQ9UCA,104880,106799,the engine the previous generative spike
hWGTvWQ9UCA,106799,108399,was a thousand cc and then a couple of
hWGTvWQ9UCA,108399,110079,years back they updated it with this
hWGTvWQ9UCA,110079,112159,1100 and to be honest in either
hWGTvWQ9UCA,112159,114479,iteration it kind of falls between what
hWGTvWQ9UCA,114479,116479,we call now the middleweight so tiger
hWGTvWQ9UCA,116479,120479,900 ktm 890 bmw f850 gs and then the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,120479,124799,true heavyweight so tiger 1200 bmw r1250
hWGTvWQ9UCA,124799,128239,gs multistrada v4 ktm 1290 those sorts
hWGTvWQ9UCA,128239,130000,of bikes and it's kind of the same with
hWGTvWQ9UCA,130000,132000,the performance figures so peak power is
hWGTvWQ9UCA,132000,134160,100 horsepower it makes that at seven
hWGTvWQ9UCA,134160,136640,and a half thousand rpm and then 105
hWGTvWQ9UCA,136640,138879,newton meters of peak torque at about 6
hWGTvWQ9UCA,138879,141599,250 i think so peak power is nowhere
hWGTvWQ9UCA,141599,144319,near really some of those proper super
hWGTvWQ9UCA,144319,146800,adventure bikes yet it's still a little
hWGTvWQ9UCA,146800,147840,above what you'd expect from the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,147840,149599,middleweights and it makes a bit more
hWGTvWQ9UCA,149599,151680,torque as well but honestly having
hWGTvWQ9UCA,151680,153680,ridden it in plenty of scenarios over
hWGTvWQ9UCA,153680,156080,the past few weeks i feel like this is
hWGTvWQ9UCA,156080,158160,pretty much as capable as the large
hWGTvWQ9UCA,158160,160560,capacity adventure bikes certainly for
hWGTvWQ9UCA,160560,162959,solo riding i haven't really felt like
hWGTvWQ9UCA,162959,165200,it's particularly slow and you only feel
hWGTvWQ9UCA,165200,166879,that lack of top end power and you're
hWGTvWQ9UCA,166879,169040,really really gassing it for motorway
hWGTvWQ9UCA,169040,170879,work for just getting around for
hWGTvWQ9UCA,170879,173360,commuting for even some more sprightly
hWGTvWQ9UCA,173360,175519,riding that usable mid-range and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,175519,178000,torquiness is absolutely enough and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,178000,180400,plenty of fun it's also surprisingly
hWGTvWQ9UCA,180400,182319,smooth for a big parallel twin and it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,182319,186560,makes a lovely note at the exhaust
hWGTvWQ9UCA,190400,192319,now for the adventure bike riders who
hWGTvWQ9UCA,192319,194640,are truly seeking thrills in top and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,194640,196640,power of course there are better options
hWGTvWQ9UCA,196640,198319,i'd also think about whether you're
hWGTvWQ9UCA,198319,200000,gonna do a lot of riding like two up
hWGTvWQ9UCA,200000,201599,with luggage perhaps if you want to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,201599,203519,perform like quick overtakes it's not
hWGTvWQ9UCA,203519,205200,gonna feel as sprightly as some of those
hWGTvWQ9UCA,205200,207440,other options but if out and out speed
hWGTvWQ9UCA,207440,209200,isn't your main objective and you prefer
hWGTvWQ9UCA,209200,211120,an engine with a really nice character
hWGTvWQ9UCA,211120,212799,to it then definitely have a look at
hWGTvWQ9UCA,212799,214799,this one now i've also got a touch on
hWGTvWQ9UCA,214799,218080,the dct box or dual clutch transmission
hWGTvWQ9UCA,218080,220159,in short it allows the bike to operate
hWGTvWQ9UCA,220159,222319,like an automatic so you can stick it in
hWGTvWQ9UCA,222319,224239,auto mode and it will make the shifts on
hWGTvWQ9UCA,224239,226560,your behalf or you can put it in manual
hWGTvWQ9UCA,226560,228560,and use these plus and minus buttons to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,228560,230640,shift the gears yourself no clutch lever
hWGTvWQ9UCA,230640,232239,though it's all done electronically and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,232239,234560,it uses two clutches hence dual clutch
hWGTvWQ9UCA,234560,236799,transmission and two sets of gears to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,236799,238959,seamlessly shift between the gears as it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,238959,240879,goes up the box and then back down again
hWGTvWQ9UCA,240879,242959,the result on the road is like yeah from
hWGTvWQ9UCA,242959,244799,a standstill it will go all the way up
hWGTvWQ9UCA,244799,246879,to sixth gear speeds
hWGTvWQ9UCA,246879,249280,seamlessly you know there's no lurching
hWGTvWQ9UCA,249280,251519,or anything like that sounds great in
hWGTvWQ9UCA,251519,254159,principle but there are a few downsides
hWGTvWQ9UCA,254159,255280,even though your wallet will be a
hWGTvWQ9UCA,255280,257120,thousand pounds lighter your bike will
hWGTvWQ9UCA,257120,259359,be 10 kilograms heavier and it's also
hWGTvWQ9UCA,259359,261040,not quite got the finesse of slipping
hWGTvWQ9UCA,261040,262560,the clutch at lower speeds you have to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,262560,264800,drag quite a bit of back brake i think
hWGTvWQ9UCA,264800,266639,personally having put plenty of miles in
hWGTvWQ9UCA,266639,268560,on this bike i'd go for the manual
hWGTvWQ9UCA,268560,270479,regular gearbox and then use some of the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,270479,272080,grand i've saved to buy the quick
hWGTvWQ9UCA,272080,273759,shifter upgrade so there you've got the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,273759,276400,clutch if you want it but also the fun
hWGTvWQ9UCA,276400,278880,and novelty and sportiness and some of
hWGTvWQ9UCA,278880,280479,the smoothness of a quick shifter and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,280479,282400,blipper it's personal preference though
hWGTvWQ9UCA,282400,284400,it really is a good system it ties into
hWGTvWQ9UCA,284400,286000,the inertial measurement unit on this
hWGTvWQ9UCA,286000,287840,bike so it knows when it's cornering it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,287840,289680,knows when it's descending downhill so
hWGTvWQ9UCA,289680,291520,it's not going to shift up so that you
hWGTvWQ9UCA,291520,293759,lose engine braking most of the time i
hWGTvWQ9UCA,293759,296000,thought it was fantastic so definitely
hWGTvWQ9UCA,296000,297680,check it out it comes down a little bit
hWGTvWQ9UCA,297680,299840,to personal preference and i would say
hWGTvWQ9UCA,299840,302800,probably the killer feature of dct is if
hWGTvWQ9UCA,302800,304880,you do a lot of two-up riding that
hWGTvWQ9UCA,304880,307199,smoothness between shifts both up and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,307199,308960,down the box you know that's going to be
hWGTvWQ9UCA,308960,310800,more meaningful to someone on the back
hWGTvWQ9UCA,310800,312639,of the bike than someone who's on the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,312639,315120,front holding onto the bars and so less
hWGTvWQ9UCA,315120,317120,lurching less of those headbutts on the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,317120,318720,back of your lid and so i reckon a
hWGTvWQ9UCA,318720,320720,passenger would love it now on to the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,320720,323280,handling and look this is a big bike
hWGTvWQ9UCA,323280,326400,like i say 250 kilograms with the dct
hWGTvWQ9UCA,326400,328800,you get a 25 liter tank which is great
hWGTvWQ9UCA,328800,330560,for range but when it's fueled up
hWGTvWQ9UCA,330560,332000,obviously it makes the bike feel a
hWGTvWQ9UCA,332000,333759,little more top-heavy and it's pretty
hWGTvWQ9UCA,333759,335440,tall as well so the standard seat is
hWGTvWQ9UCA,335440,337840,adjustable between 850 and 870 mil
hWGTvWQ9UCA,337840,340720,granted you can get a 25 mil lower seat
hWGTvWQ9UCA,340720,343120,accessory but overall it's a big tall
hWGTvWQ9UCA,343120,345280,bike and so at lower speeds if you're
hWGTvWQ9UCA,345280,347280,not super tall like me it just takes a
hWGTvWQ9UCA,347280,348800,little bit of getting used to especially
hWGTvWQ9UCA,348800,351199,with the dct you're effectively riding
hWGTvWQ9UCA,351199,353280,it on the throttle it does feel very
hWGTvWQ9UCA,353280,355520,stable though and you do have nice wide
hWGTvWQ9UCA,355520,357680,bars here very wide bars so you've got a
hWGTvWQ9UCA,357680,359919,lot of leverage there but clearly a bike
hWGTvWQ9UCA,359919,361919,like this isn't gonna thrive in town
hWGTvWQ9UCA,361919,364000,traffic it's not really designed for
hWGTvWQ9UCA,364000,365680,that and where it does excel is on the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,365680,368000,open road now this bike is the top spec
hWGTvWQ9UCA,368000,369919,of the africa twin lineup so it gets the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,369919,372639,full showa electronic suspension setup
hWGTvWQ9UCA,372639,374400,i've got the two user configurable
hWGTvWQ9UCA,374400,376160,riding modes set up pretty much the same
hWGTvWQ9UCA,376160,378639,but one has firm damping and one has
hWGTvWQ9UCA,378639,380479,much softer damping stick it in that
hWGTvWQ9UCA,380479,382479,soft mode and it really is dead comfy
hWGTvWQ9UCA,382479,384240,when you're cruising in a straight line
hWGTvWQ9UCA,384240,386400,on the more engaging and twisty roads it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,386400,388639,impressed me as well this is another
hWGTvWQ9UCA,388639,390639,area in which i think it outperforms the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,390639,392560,spec sheet i mean sure it's got the top
hWGTvWQ9UCA,392560,394560,drawer suspension on this model but it's
hWGTvWQ9UCA,394560,396160,still a big adventure bike you've got
hWGTvWQ9UCA,396160,398720,large diameter spoked wheels adventure
hWGTvWQ9UCA,398720,400720,tires and the braking setup isn't the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,400720,402479,latest and greatest from brembo but
hWGTvWQ9UCA,402479,404960,honestly it handles really very nicely i
hWGTvWQ9UCA,404960,407039,had a lot of fun on this bike carving up
hWGTvWQ9UCA,407039,409039,twistier roads and the brakes like i say
hWGTvWQ9UCA,409039,410800,they're easily up to the job i did
hWGTvWQ9UCA,410800,412560,notice though a little bit of squeal
hWGTvWQ9UCA,412560,414319,when you get down to sort of walking
hWGTvWQ9UCA,414319,416319,speed but perhaps they're still bedding
hWGTvWQ9UCA,416319,418080,in a little this press bike doesn't have
hWGTvWQ9UCA,418080,419919,many miles on it and otherwise the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,419919,421680,braking performance is great plenty of
hWGTvWQ9UCA,421680,423919,power plenty of feel i'd also say
hWGTvWQ9UCA,423919,426080,another massive strength of this bike is
hWGTvWQ9UCA,426080,428160,the comfort i mean the riding position
hWGTvWQ9UCA,428160,430160,for me although the seat is slightly on
hWGTvWQ9UCA,430160,431680,the tall side when you get moving you've
hWGTvWQ9UCA,431680,434160,got plenty of space to move around big
hWGTvWQ9UCA,434160,435759,wide bars which feel great on the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,435759,437919,motorway a tall commanding riding
hWGTvWQ9UCA,437919,439919,position yet you've got plenty of wind
hWGTvWQ9UCA,439919,442319,protection so a big tank that flares out
hWGTvWQ9UCA,442319,444000,and then also an adjustable windscreen
hWGTvWQ9UCA,444000,446400,so you just use these two little catches
hWGTvWQ9UCA,446400,447440,here
hWGTvWQ9UCA,447440,449199,and it can be down so you've got good
hWGTvWQ9UCA,449199,451520,visibility over it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,451520,452880,or up for a little bit more wind
hWGTvWQ9UCA,452880,454240,protection not quite as good as
hWGTvWQ9UCA,454240,456400,something like the nt 1100 i rode that
hWGTvWQ9UCA,456400,458000,on the launch a couple of months ago
hWGTvWQ9UCA,458000,459680,it's based upon the same engine and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,459680,461520,chassis as this bike but it's more road
hWGTvWQ9UCA,461520,463440,focused than touring focus so you really
hWGTvWQ9UCA,463440,465520,do get a big screen on that bike and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,465520,467840,great protection on your feet from spray
hWGTvWQ9UCA,467840,469440,from the front wheel but as far as
hWGTvWQ9UCA,469440,471360,adventure bikes go this is super
hWGTvWQ9UCA,471360,473039,comfortable for me a few of the nice
hWGTvWQ9UCA,473039,474560,features would be the hand guards to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,474560,476080,keep a little bit of wind off your hands
hWGTvWQ9UCA,476080,477520,and then you get heated grips as
hWGTvWQ9UCA,477520,479360,standard on this bike perhaps you might
hWGTvWQ9UCA,479360,481039,get a heated seat elsewhere but
hWGTvWQ9UCA,481039,483280,personally i wear heated trousers and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,483280,485440,jacket under my riding gear and so it's
hWGTvWQ9UCA,485440,487599,not a necessity for me now in terms of
hWGTvWQ9UCA,487599,489599,tech this is pretty much up there with
hWGTvWQ9UCA,489599,491759,most of the large capacity adventure
hWGTvWQ9UCA,491759,493520,bikes there are only a few features that
hWGTvWQ9UCA,493520,495440,are missing that i'll get onto it does
hWGTvWQ9UCA,495440,497440,get an inertial measurement unit as i've
hWGTvWQ9UCA,497440,499360,mentioned so you've got plenty of riding
hWGTvWQ9UCA,499360,500800,modes and rider raids and you can
hWGTvWQ9UCA,500800,502560,customize them through the screen and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,502560,504639,they take that lean angle data into
hWGTvWQ9UCA,504639,505840,account so that they're corner
hWGTvWQ9UCA,505840,508319,insensitive you get a pretty great tft
hWGTvWQ9UCA,508319,510240,screen up there as well nice and big
hWGTvWQ9UCA,510240,512080,it's got bluetooth connectivity so you
hWGTvWQ9UCA,512080,514159,can use honda's own phone integration
hWGTvWQ9UCA,514159,516479,for nav and stuff like that but also it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,516479,519120,supports carplay and android auto so you
hWGTvWQ9UCA,519120,521279,can use your favorite apps for calls
hWGTvWQ9UCA,521279,524399,messages music podcasts and navigation
hWGTvWQ9UCA,524399,526399,personally i love using carplay in my
hWGTvWQ9UCA,526399,528640,car it's way better than the proprietary
hWGTvWQ9UCA,528640,530560,apps the only thing on this bike is that
hWGTvWQ9UCA,530560,532720,the usb port is up by the bars so
hWGTvWQ9UCA,532720,534320,something like the gold wing you'll have
hWGTvWQ9UCA,534320,536560,a stash for your phone in the trunk or
hWGTvWQ9UCA,536560,538480,the top case that keeps the phone out
hWGTvWQ9UCA,538480,540160,the way keeps the bars nice and clean
hWGTvWQ9UCA,540160,542399,and clear but still allows you access to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,542399,544160,all of those apps and allows you to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,544160,545920,control them with the switch gear the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,545920,547920,tiger 900 it doesn't have car play but
hWGTvWQ9UCA,547920,549760,it has a similar idea for an adventure
hWGTvWQ9UCA,549760,551600,bike it's got a little waterproof stash
hWGTvWQ9UCA,551600,553839,box under the saddle keeps the phone out
hWGTvWQ9UCA,553839,555760,the way but still allows you to interact
hWGTvWQ9UCA,555760,557600,with it through the bike's infotainment
hWGTvWQ9UCA,557600,559360,system and yeah i think i kind of like
hWGTvWQ9UCA,559360,561600,to see something similar on this bike
hWGTvWQ9UCA,561600,563120,having the phone plugged into the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,563120,564720,cockpit area means that you have to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,564720,566480,mount it on the bars and if the phone's
hWGTvWQ9UCA,566480,568480,on the bars anyway you may as well use
hWGTvWQ9UCA,568480,570720,that screen for phone functionality so
hWGTvWQ9UCA,570720,572480,nav and whatever and that means that you
hWGTvWQ9UCA,572480,574399,still get to use that brilliant tft
hWGTvWQ9UCA,574399,576560,screen for the basic riding information
hWGTvWQ9UCA,576560,578480,and managing riding modes and all those
hWGTvWQ9UCA,578480,581279,sorts of general riding data still it's
hWGTvWQ9UCA,581279,583440,a nice feature it's a massive usp you
hWGTvWQ9UCA,583440,585040,can get it on some harleys and some
hWGTvWQ9UCA,585040,586880,indians but generally hondas are the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,586880,588720,only other bikes you find it on and this
hWGTvWQ9UCA,588720,590480,is the only adventure bike i think with
hWGTvWQ9UCA,590480,592320,carplay and so for some people who
hWGTvWQ9UCA,592320,594240,really like carplay or android auto
hWGTvWQ9UCA,594240,596160,that's going to be a massive selling
hWGTvWQ9UCA,596160,598000,point of this bike there's lots of other
hWGTvWQ9UCA,598000,599519,nice little touches like the power
hWGTvWQ9UCA,599519,601440,outlet in the cockpit there it does get
hWGTvWQ9UCA,601440,602959,cornering headlights as well so it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,602959,604640,illuminates the inside of a turn when
hWGTvWQ9UCA,604640,606720,it's banked over it gets their emergency
hWGTvWQ9UCA,606720,608399,brake light system so it flashes the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,608399,609839,indicators when you're hard on the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,609839,611200,brakes and so yeah it's pretty
hWGTvWQ9UCA,611200,612560,comprehensive there are just a few
hWGTvWQ9UCA,612560,614079,things i thought of that other bikes
hWGTvWQ9UCA,614079,615600,offer that this doesn't the cruise
hWGTvWQ9UCA,615600,617519,control is great but some bikes now
hWGTvWQ9UCA,617519,619680,offer adaptive or active cruise control
hWGTvWQ9UCA,619680,621920,that use radars to follow the traffic
hWGTvWQ9UCA,621920,624000,ahead you can get it on the ktm you can
hWGTvWQ9UCA,624000,626480,get it on the ducati some bmws have it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,626480,628079,so it can't be long before we see it on
hWGTvWQ9UCA,628079,630640,the gs and even the new tiger 1200 it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,630640,632399,doesn't have active cruise control but
hWGTvWQ9UCA,632399,634399,it does get a rear radar for blind spot
hWGTvWQ9UCA,634399,636480,warnings it also doesn't get keyless
hWGTvWQ9UCA,636480,639040,ignition some people love it some people
hWGTvWQ9UCA,639040,640880,i think absolutely hate the idea
hWGTvWQ9UCA,640880,642480,personally i don't find it a massive
hWGTvWQ9UCA,642480,644800,problem to operate a key and also i've
hWGTvWQ9UCA,644800,646079,had it on press bikes where the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,646079,647839,batteries got low and i've just thought
hWGTvWQ9UCA,647839,650160,i wish it was just a normal regular key
hWGTvWQ9UCA,650160,651839,so i don't have to sort this out then
hWGTvWQ9UCA,651839,653760,again it is quite convenient to have
hWGTvWQ9UCA,653760,655680,like the steering lock and the filler
hWGTvWQ9UCA,655680,657839,cap all integrated into a keyless system
hWGTvWQ9UCA,657839,660000,so again some people won't care but
hWGTvWQ9UCA,660000,661839,others if you want that you'll have to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,661839,663600,get it elsewhere now the last thing and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,663600,665200,i think i've noticed this more because
hWGTvWQ9UCA,665200,667040,it's february so it's pretty dark in the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,667040,668959,evenings is that it doesn't get
hWGTvWQ9UCA,668959,671920,illuminated switch gear even my lowly
hWGTvWQ9UCA,671920,674880,tiger 800 has it and um especially with
hWGTvWQ9UCA,674880,676959,this many buttons it'd be nice to see
hWGTvWQ9UCA,676959,679040,where stuff is i mean perhaps if you own
hWGTvWQ9UCA,679040,680720,the bike for a long time it becomes sort
hWGTvWQ9UCA,680720,682880,of muscle memory to find certain buttons
hWGTvWQ9UCA,682880,684800,and so you don't rely on seeing them so
hWGTvWQ9UCA,684800,686079,much but yeah if you live in the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,686079,687600,summerset area and over the past few
hWGTvWQ9UCA,687600,689360,weeks you've heard someone riding around
hWGTvWQ9UCA,689360,691200,on an africa twin in the evenings
hWGTvWQ9UCA,691200,693360,randomly honking the horn
hWGTvWQ9UCA,693360,696000,that'd be me
hWGTvWQ9UCA,696640,698240,but you know overall i think it's a
hWGTvWQ9UCA,698240,699839,great tech package on this bike and i
hWGTvWQ9UCA,699839,701360,don't want to take away from that i
hWGTvWQ9UCA,701360,703760,think active cruise and keyless at least
hWGTvWQ9UCA,703760,706000,are largely personal preference now of
hWGTvWQ9UCA,706000,708000,course most adventure by riders are
hWGTvWQ9UCA,708000,710800,purely utilitarian and functionality
hWGTvWQ9UCA,710800,713360,focused beings but it has to be said
hWGTvWQ9UCA,713360,715279,this is a heck of a good looking bike
hWGTvWQ9UCA,715279,716720,and if you bought it for that reason i
hWGTvWQ9UCA,716720,718959,would not resent you i like that it's
hWGTvWQ9UCA,718959,721120,bold it's got that tri-color paint job
hWGTvWQ9UCA,721120,723920,the new big africa twin logo the gold
hWGTvWQ9UCA,723920,726160,forks and handlebars and rims really set
hWGTvWQ9UCA,726160,728240,it off it's modern it's got a bit of
hWGTvWQ9UCA,728240,730240,personality with the sort of face that
hWGTvWQ9UCA,730240,731920,they've given it and then it's got this
hWGTvWQ9UCA,731920,734160,very aggressive looking stance where it
hWGTvWQ9UCA,734160,735440,really does
hWGTvWQ9UCA,735440,737519,bulk up towards the top here and gives
hWGTvWQ9UCA,737519,740079,it a very muscular appearance we've got
hWGTvWQ9UCA,740079,741600,some good looking adventure bikes on the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,741600,743680,market at the moment the tiger 900 rally
hWGTvWQ9UCA,743680,745920,probing matt khaki green i think that's
hWGTvWQ9UCA,745920,747680,a beautiful looking bike also the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,747680,750000,husqvarna norden 901 what a great
hWGTvWQ9UCA,750000,751920,looking machine that is but for me this
hWGTvWQ9UCA,751920,753760,is the one that does it out of the whole
hWGTvWQ9UCA,753760,755920,adventure market i think it is really
hWGTvWQ9UCA,755920,758560,genuinely absolutely gorgeous it's
hWGTvWQ9UCA,758560,760160,totally subjective though so let me know
hWGTvWQ9UCA,760160,761920,what you think of it looks wise down in
hWGTvWQ9UCA,761920,763839,the comments below now let's talk about
hWGTvWQ9UCA,763839,765839,value for money and i think it really
hWGTvWQ9UCA,765839,767600,depends whether this looks like good
hWGTvWQ9UCA,767600,770000,value at where you're starting from in
hWGTvWQ9UCA,770000,772079,this spec with the dct and the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,772079,773839,electronic suspension this is top of the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,773839,776160,range so it's like 17 and a half grand
hWGTvWQ9UCA,776160,777600,and on the face of it it sounds like a
hWGTvWQ9UCA,777600,780000,lot of money certainly if you consider
hWGTvWQ9UCA,780000,781920,this a competitor to the middleweights
hWGTvWQ9UCA,781920,783760,like i was saying earlier then it does
hWGTvWQ9UCA,783760,785680,look quite expensive but to me in
hWGTvWQ9UCA,785680,787440,capability this feels like a large
hWGTvWQ9UCA,787440,789200,capacity adventure bike we just talked
hWGTvWQ9UCA,789200,790959,about all the tech it has but it's also
hWGTvWQ9UCA,790959,792560,got that presence it's got the fuel
hWGTvWQ9UCA,792560,794480,range it's got that wind protection it's
hWGTvWQ9UCA,794480,796720,got the stability it's got plenty of
hWGTvWQ9UCA,796720,798399,space to carry full luggage and a
hWGTvWQ9UCA,798399,800480,passenger and so in that case you would
hWGTvWQ9UCA,800480,802639,compare it directly to the gs because
hWGTvWQ9UCA,802639,804800,that's the biggest seller by far in that
hWGTvWQ9UCA,804800,807600,market if you spec up a gs adventure in
hWGTvWQ9UCA,807600,809519,the rally trim so a similar look to this
hWGTvWQ9UCA,809519,811760,bike and you add the necessary packages
hWGTvWQ9UCA,811760,813920,for like heated grips cruise control
hWGTvWQ9UCA,813920,816160,their electronic suspension it starts to
hWGTvWQ9UCA,816160,818320,come up pretty similar if not a little
hWGTvWQ9UCA,818320,820480,more expensive than this bike now that
hWGTvWQ9UCA,820480,822800,the gs does have more power more peak
hWGTvWQ9UCA,822800,824720,torque a little more fuel capacity and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,824720,826959,look it's a proven bestseller and for
hWGTvWQ9UCA,826959,828720,good reason but the africa twins
hWGTvWQ9UCA,828720,830800,certainly has its own merits like i just
hWGTvWQ9UCA,830800,832720,said looks wise i think it's brilliant
hWGTvWQ9UCA,832720,834560,the handling perhaps has a little more
hWGTvWQ9UCA,834560,836079,feedback and then you've got a few
hWGTvWQ9UCA,836079,838079,little usps that you can't get elsewhere
hWGTvWQ9UCA,838079,840320,on the market like carplay android auto
hWGTvWQ9UCA,840320,842959,and the dct option so overall super
hWGTvWQ9UCA,842959,844240,impressed with it and like i said i
hWGTvWQ9UCA,844240,846240,think it does a little bit better on the
hWGTvWQ9UCA,846240,848399,road than the spec sheet suggests as
hWGTvWQ9UCA,848399,849519,always i'd love to know what you think
hWGTvWQ9UCA,849519,851199,of it down in the comments below and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,851199,853600,perhaps which bike you'd go for and also
hWGTvWQ9UCA,853600,855360,i didn't really cover off-roading today
hWGTvWQ9UCA,855360,856880,because in about a month's time i'm
hWGTvWQ9UCA,856880,859120,doing two days with the honda adventure
hWGTvWQ9UCA,859120,860639,experience down in devon and we'll be
hWGTvWQ9UCA,860639,863040,riding the more off-road biased base
hWGTvWQ9UCA,863040,864800,version so if you want to see that video
hWGTvWQ9UCA,864800,866000,when it goes live if you're not
hWGTvWQ9UCA,866000,868000,subscribed already hit subscribe and
hWGTvWQ9UCA,868000,871399,i'll see you then
