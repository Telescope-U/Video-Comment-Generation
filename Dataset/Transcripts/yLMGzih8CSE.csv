yLMGzih8CSE,80,2159,hey guys i'm tunnel tech chap and this
yLMGzih8CSE,2159,4839,is the brand spanking new dell xps 15
yLMGzih8CSE,4839,7440,9520 you can't tell from the outside
yLMGzih8CSE,7440,9040,well except for this sticker here but
yLMGzih8CSE,9040,12719,this is the new 2022 model and it is a
yLMGzih8CSE,12719,14639,terrific laptop a lot of people buy
yLMGzih8CSE,14639,16960,these i have for many years and a lot of
yLMGzih8CSE,16960,18960,reviewers still think this is the best
yLMGzih8CSE,18960,21359,15-inch laptop you can buy and for good
yLMGzih8CSE,21359,24080,reason dell have been evolving the xbs
yLMGzih8CSE,24080,27119,and the 15 for the past 12 years now and
yLMGzih8CSE,27119,28800,all the ones i've tested over the last
yLMGzih8CSE,28800,30800,four five six years have been pretty
yLMGzih8CSE,30800,33120,great and the good news i suppose is
yLMGzih8CSE,33120,35040,that it's business as usual if it ain't
yLMGzih8CSE,35040,37520,broke don't fix it which dale certainly
yLMGzih8CSE,37520,39280,did not and actually
yLMGzih8CSE,39280,40879,well no that's not good news because in
yLMGzih8CSE,40879,42800,some ways it is a bit broken this thing
yLMGzih8CSE,42800,44879,gets too hot and too loud and as
yLMGzih8CSE,44879,46960,beautiful and well still impressive as
yLMGzih8CSE,46960,49280,it is it's struggling to stand out now
yLMGzih8CSE,49280,50960,compared to the likes of the asus
yLMGzih8CSE,50960,53840,zenbook pro 16x oled and of course
yLMGzih8CSE,53840,54719,this
yLMGzih8CSE,54719,56399,the macbook pro 16.
yLMGzih8CSE,56399,57840,if you are a regular on the channel you
yLMGzih8CSE,57840,59680,know that i've been using the xps 15s as
yLMGzih8CSE,59680,62480,my main work and 18 laptops for quite a
yLMGzih8CSE,62480,65439,few years now until i switched to this
yLMGzih8CSE,65439,66960,late last year when it came out this is
yLMGzih8CSE,66960,70479,the 16 with the m1 max it is an absolute
yLMGzih8CSE,70479,72400,beast and actually one of the reasons i
yLMGzih8CSE,72400,74560,did switch to this not just because i do
yLMGzih8CSE,74560,76159,quite like the apple ecosystem i use
yLMGzih8CSE,76159,78479,airdrop all the time but the media
yLMGzih8CSE,78479,80080,engine in this there are no other
yLMGzih8CSE,80080,82080,laptops out there outside of macbooks
yLMGzih8CSE,82080,83520,particularly the highest spec ones where
yLMGzih8CSE,83520,85840,i can seamlessly scrub through premiere
yLMGzih8CSE,85840,87439,pro my timeline
yLMGzih8CSE,87439,90320,with no lag or stutter the advantage of
yLMGzih8CSE,90320,92640,this is that we have that cuda gpu
yLMGzih8CSE,92640,95439,acceleration but in my everyday life
yLMGzih8CSE,95439,97439,i use this all the time and there's just
yLMGzih8CSE,97439,99680,really no windows equivalent to it yet
yLMGzih8CSE,99680,101680,unfortunately this is going off topic a
yLMGzih8CSE,101680,104560,little bit but the seamless integration
yLMGzih8CSE,104560,105840,that apple have right now with their
yLMGzih8CSE,105840,107920,hardware and their software every
yLMGzih8CSE,107920,109759,windows laptop well it feels like they
yLMGzih8CSE,109759,111600,have to make them with one arm tie
yLMGzih8CSE,111600,112960,behind their back because they have to
yLMGzih8CSE,112960,115920,work with intel or amd and then nvidia
yLMGzih8CSE,115920,117680,or amd on the gpu side and then they
yLMGzih8CSE,117680,119119,have to put it into their own chassis
yLMGzih8CSE,119119,121360,optimization and efficiency is wasted
yLMGzih8CSE,121360,122960,but even though i've switched to this
yLMGzih8CSE,122960,124399,macbooks aren't for everyone they are
yLMGzih8CSE,124399,126240,very expensive although so is this when
yLMGzih8CSE,126240,128000,you spec it up a little bit but a lot of
yLMGzih8CSE,128000,129840,people still prefer windows they have to
yLMGzih8CSE,129840,131440,use windows for work and if you're
yLMGzih8CSE,131440,132800,gaming you're going to get better frame
yLMGzih8CSE,132800,134800,rates and well about a million times
yLMGzih8CSE,134800,136640,more games you can actually play on this
yLMGzih8CSE,136640,138239,and one thing you don't get with an
yLMGzih8CSE,138239,140319,apple laptop right now is the option for
yLMGzih8CSE,140319,142560,an oled screen the pros do have mini
yLMGzih8CSE,142560,144480,leds so it comes close and it also gets
yLMGzih8CSE,144480,146400,brighter which is actually quite a
yLMGzih8CSE,146400,148879,significant advantage but this is oled
yLMGzih8CSE,148879,151760,so you get those rich deep inky blacks
yLMGzih8CSE,151760,153680,now if this does look familiar then it's
yLMGzih8CSE,153680,155519,because well it's because it is we've
yLMGzih8CSE,155519,157040,had the same design for a couple of
yLMGzih8CSE,157040,158959,years now save for the addition of that
yLMGzih8CSE,158959,161519,oled screen which came in last year
yLMGzih8CSE,161519,164319,so what is actually new here well
yLMGzih8CSE,164319,165680,a couple of things and that's about it
yLMGzih8CSE,165680,167440,to be honest uh we've got the new 12th
yLMGzih8CSE,167440,170879,gen intel processors out of the i5 i7 i9
yLMGzih8CSE,170879,172319,and actually they are a bit of an
yLMGzih8CSE,172319,173760,upgrade it'll come to performance in a
yLMGzih8CSE,173760,176879,second we also have faster ddr5 ram and
yLMGzih8CSE,176879,179599,also slightly improved battery life and
yLMGzih8CSE,179599,180959,that is about it so uh thank you for
yLMGzih8CSE,180959,181840,watching and i'll see you next time
yLMGzih8CSE,181840,183590,right here on the tech jam
yLMGzih8CSE,183590,188159,[Music]
yLMGzih8CSE,188159,189120,okay we should probably talk a little
yLMGzih8CSE,189120,190480,bit more about this
yLMGzih8CSE,190480,193200,this is a fairly minor refresh and in
yLMGzih8CSE,193200,195519,fact we even have the same gpus we get
yLMGzih8CSE,195519,198959,the rtx 3050 and the 3050 ti options
yLMGzih8CSE,198959,201360,still no amd still no 3060 which is
yLMGzih8CSE,201360,203680,exclusive to the 17 inch there's also
yLMGzih8CSE,203680,206480,still no wi-fi 6e which is a bit bizarre
yLMGzih8CSE,206480,208560,and also still no high refresh rate
yLMGzih8CSE,208560,211040,which is a bit frustrating but hold your
yLMGzih8CSE,211040,213360,horses this is still an upgrade and it
yLMGzih8CSE,213360,216000,is still a stunning laptop
yLMGzih8CSE,216000,218319,so right now the xps lineup includes the
yLMGzih8CSE,218319,222000,13 the 13 plus the 15 and the 17 and the
yLMGzih8CSE,222000,224080,main difference coming up from the 13s
yLMGzih8CSE,224080,226480,is that we get a dedicated gpu in here
yLMGzih8CSE,226480,228560,as well as more ports a bigger battery
yLMGzih8CSE,228560,231200,and well a bigger screen however the 15
yLMGzih8CSE,231200,232959,does lack the better vapor chamber
yLMGzih8CSE,232959,235599,cooling that we get on the 17 plus as i
yLMGzih8CSE,235599,238159,say the gpu tops out at the 30 50 ti
yLMGzih8CSE,238159,240879,rather than the 360. and actually the
yLMGzih8CSE,240879,243760,3050 ti i have in here has been down
yLMGzih8CSE,243760,245760,clocked significantly compared to last
yLMGzih8CSE,245760,247920,year but the trade-off is the 15 is a
yLMGzih8CSE,247920,249760,good deal lighter and more portable so i
yLMGzih8CSE,249760,251840,still think this is the sweet spot in
yLMGzih8CSE,251840,253519,the xps range
yLMGzih8CSE,253519,255599,this video is sponsored by my favorite
yLMGzih8CSE,255599,258560,vpn surf shark i have it on my desktop
yLMGzih8CSE,258560,260799,in chrome on my phone you can get it on
yLMGzih8CSE,260799,262320,nearly everything and actually one
yLMGzih8CSE,262320,264160,account can be used with an unlimited
yLMGzih8CSE,264160,266160,number of devices so there's obviously
yLMGzih8CSE,266160,268479,loads of vpns out there but surf shark
yLMGzih8CSE,268479,270720,is such a simple and lightweight app you
yLMGzih8CSE,270720,272320,really don't mind having it running they
yLMGzih8CSE,272320,274880,also have an impressive 4.3 trust pilot
yLMGzih8CSE,274880,277520,rating and it's just really easy to use
yLMGzih8CSE,277520,279360,you can pick from thousands of servers
yLMGzih8CSE,279360,281040,around the world and then access
yLMGzih8CSE,281040,283759,websites and content region free and
yLMGzih8CSE,283759,286800,privately plus their exclusive clean web
yLMGzih8CSE,286800,288960,tool helps keep you safe online so
yLMGzih8CSE,288960,290160,whether you're at home or you're
yLMGzih8CSE,290160,291680,traveling and you need to access your
yLMGzih8CSE,291680,293759,email your bank or your shopping it
yLMGzih8CSE,293759,296479,helps prevent tracking malware and ads
yLMGzih8CSE,296479,298479,but the best bit is not only do you get
yLMGzih8CSE,298479,301120,83 off and also three months extra for
yLMGzih8CSE,301120,303039,free if you use the code tech chat at
yLMGzih8CSE,303039,305039,the checkout but sub shark are also
yLMGzih8CSE,305039,307520,giving away their antivirus for free
yLMGzih8CSE,307520,309600,until the end of june so click the link
yLMGzih8CSE,309600,311360,in the description below and get started
yLMGzih8CSE,311360,313199,with surf shock and if you're not super
yLMGzih8CSE,313199,315199,duper satisfied then they also have a 30
yLMGzih8CSE,315199,318160,day money back guarantee
yLMGzih8CSE,318160,320000,i think by now we're all pretty familiar
yLMGzih8CSE,320000,322639,with the aluminium chassis and this
yLMGzih8CSE,322639,325120,carbon fiber palm rest it still looks
yLMGzih8CSE,325120,327759,good although i do prefer the arctic
yLMGzih8CSE,327759,329600,silvery white option that you get in the
yLMGzih8CSE,329600,331199,u.s but actually right now for some
yLMGzih8CSE,331199,332800,reason is not available in the uk it
yLMGzih8CSE,332800,334560,could be a stock issue and with these
yLMGzih8CSE,334560,336800,super thin bezels and this huge touch
yLMGzih8CSE,336800,339600,pad it is a very smart looking laptop
yLMGzih8CSE,339600,341919,although the downside still is that the
yLMGzih8CSE,341919,343759,palm rest and the keys can get a bit
yLMGzih8CSE,343759,346160,grubby and fingerprinty and also watch
yLMGzih8CSE,346160,347199,out for the
yLMGzih8CSE,347199,349759,shiny aluminium edges of this because it
yLMGzih8CSE,349759,352000,scratches quite easily and then because
yLMGzih8CSE,352000,354560,it is a bit glossy you do notice it
yLMGzih8CSE,354560,356240,where did i put the
yLMGzih8CSE,356240,358479,there it is okay here we go this is the
yLMGzih8CSE,358479,361600,xps 13 plus i am working on my review of
yLMGzih8CSE,361600,363360,this at the same time so make sure you
yLMGzih8CSE,363360,364720,have hit that subscribe button as i'll
yLMGzih8CSE,364720,366800,have a video of this coming very soon
yLMGzih8CSE,366800,368400,but you can see we've got it in the
yLMGzih8CSE,368400,371120,arctic white color so actually if i put
yLMGzih8CSE,371120,373360,it side by side with the
yLMGzih8CSE,373360,376960,traditional this is gonna be tricky
yLMGzih8CSE,376960,378880,black carbon fiber
yLMGzih8CSE,378880,381440,color which do you prefer i think the
yLMGzih8CSE,381440,384080,white looks a lot snazzier perhaps not
yLMGzih8CSE,384080,385280,quite as subtle if you're going to take
yLMGzih8CSE,385280,387120,it into a meeting but it looks a lot
yLMGzih8CSE,387120,389199,more futuristic in fact the whole 13
yLMGzih8CSE,389199,391440,plus looks more futuristic and that is
yLMGzih8CSE,391440,392960,kind of one of my issues as i say there
yLMGzih8CSE,392960,395199,really is no design refresh or change to
yLMGzih8CSE,395199,396880,be fair not everyone is going to love
yLMGzih8CSE,396880,399360,that uh keyboard layout the keycaps are
yLMGzih8CSE,399360,400800,much bigger but there's no room there's
yLMGzih8CSE,400800,402400,no gap between them so it's kind of hard
yLMGzih8CSE,402400,403759,to feel your way around it takes a
yLMGzih8CSE,403759,405199,little bit of time to get used to and
yLMGzih8CSE,405199,407759,also we have this capacitive function
yLMGzih8CSE,407759,410000,row at the top so in my mind this feels
yLMGzih8CSE,410000,412319,like the next generation of dell's
yLMGzih8CSE,412319,414720,designs and sort of laptops whereas this
yLMGzih8CSE,414720,417120,feels a bit last gens so possibly next
yLMGzih8CSE,417120,419520,year we'll see this can design moving on
yLMGzih8CSE,419520,421919,to the 15 and 17s which would be quite
yLMGzih8CSE,421919,423599,interesting to see but it would also
yLMGzih8CSE,423599,425120,mean this is kind of like the last
yLMGzih8CSE,425120,427520,generation of the current design and
yLMGzih8CSE,427520,428960,it's one of my conclusions at the end
yLMGzih8CSE,428960,431199,but i'll just tell you right now i think
yLMGzih8CSE,431199,433520,last year's xps 15 is still going to be
yLMGzih8CSE,433520,435280,a better buy you can get a similar
yLMGzih8CSE,435280,436960,high-end spec for about
yLMGzih8CSE,436960,438639,seven eight hundred quid less assuming
yLMGzih8CSE,438639,440479,you can find one than this and while
yLMGzih8CSE,440479,442080,this is better and i'll show you how and
yLMGzih8CSE,442080,443440,why in a second
yLMGzih8CSE,443440,445599,it's not that much better so um i still
yLMGzih8CSE,445599,446880,think last year's model might be the
yLMGzih8CSE,446880,449280,better option or indeed wait a year and
yLMGzih8CSE,449280,451599,let's see what the new 15 and 17 so
yLMGzih8CSE,451599,454560,maybe the 15 plus and 17 pluses could be
yLMGzih8CSE,454560,455599,like
yLMGzih8CSE,455599,457680,build quality is top notch though the
yLMGzih8CSE,457680,459520,whole thing just feels nice to hold and
yLMGzih8CSE,459520,461759,it is impressively slim given the power
yLMGzih8CSE,461759,463120,on offer here
yLMGzih8CSE,463120,465199,so how much is it well as always it
yLMGzih8CSE,465199,466720,comes down to where you live and of
yLMGzih8CSE,466720,468800,course the spec that you go for in the
yLMGzih8CSE,468800,472720,uk the 15 starts at 1549 pounds which is
yLMGzih8CSE,472720,474240,actually 50 quid less than the
yLMGzih8CSE,474240,476400,equivalent model from last year although
yLMGzih8CSE,476400,478080,right now there is a sale on which gets
yLMGzih8CSE,478080,480000,you 150 off
yLMGzih8CSE,480000,483680,in the us the base spec starts at 1449
yLMGzih8CSE,483680,485280,however once you start going for the
yLMGzih8CSE,485280,486639,higher specs
yLMGzih8CSE,486639,488800,it gets a bit pricey my near enough
yLMGzih8CSE,488800,490879,maxed out model here with an i9 and a
yLMGzih8CSE,490879,494479,3050 ti 64 gigs of the new ddr5 ram
yLMGzih8CSE,494479,496240,along with the oled screen and a one
yLMGzih8CSE,496240,498599,terabyte ssd we're looking at
yLMGzih8CSE,498599,500960,3049 pounds and you can add a couple
yLMGzih8CSE,500960,502960,hundred more if you want a two terabyte
yLMGzih8CSE,502960,506240,ssd personally i would go with the i7 i
yLMGzih8CSE,506240,507599,really don't think i could justify
yLMGzih8CSE,507599,510800,paying 400 quid more for the i9 that is
yLMGzih8CSE,510800,512640,quite frankly ridiculous and if you do
yLMGzih8CSE,512640,514959,want the gpu then the extra 50 pounds or
yLMGzih8CSE,514959,518000,100 for the ti is definitely worth it
yLMGzih8CSE,518000,520080,and i would also go with 16 gigs of ram
yLMGzih8CSE,520080,522159,one terabyte storage and personally i
yLMGzih8CSE,522159,524000,would go with the oled screen so
yLMGzih8CSE,524000,526000,altogether my recommended model will
yLMGzih8CSE,526000,529600,cost you about 2 400 or 2 200 pounds
yLMGzih8CSE,529600,531680,this is actually not bad value for money
yLMGzih8CSE,531680,534399,considering it's a ultra premium kind of
yLMGzih8CSE,534399,536560,workstation replacement laptop and it is
yLMGzih8CSE,536560,537920,certainly cheaper than the macbook pro
yLMGzih8CSE,537920,540240,16 and although that's not an exact like
yLMGzih8CSE,540240,542720,flight comparison if we pop off the base
yLMGzih8CSE,542720,544560,you can see there are two ram modules
yLMGzih8CSE,544560,547440,along with the pci4 ssd both of which
yLMGzih8CSE,547440,549200,you can upgrade yourself so it might be
yLMGzih8CSE,549200,551200,more cost effective to buy a lower spec
yLMGzih8CSE,551200,552959,now and maybe upgrade these further down
yLMGzih8CSE,552959,555120,the line another carryover from last
yLMGzih8CSE,555120,557279,year are these fantastic speakers we
yLMGzih8CSE,557279,559360,have dual woofers and dual tweeters
yLMGzih8CSE,559360,561519,which make up an 8 watt system and it
yLMGzih8CSE,561519,563200,gives us one of the best sounding
yLMGzih8CSE,563200,564880,laptops you can buy
yLMGzih8CSE,564880,566640,again perhaps except for that pesky
yLMGzih8CSE,566640,569200,macbook pro
yLMGzih8CSE,570560,572480,we also get the same lovely keyboard
yLMGzih8CSE,572480,573600,which is actually still one of my
yLMGzih8CSE,573600,575200,favorites on a windows laptop with
yLMGzih8CSE,575200,577519,well-spaced keys and plenty of feedback
yLMGzih8CSE,577519,579279,and that's alongside this massive
yLMGzih8CSE,579279,581120,precision touchpad which is just as
yLMGzih8CSE,581120,583040,lovely to use as ever although we don't
yLMGzih8CSE,583040,584880,get the haptic feedback that we get on
yLMGzih8CSE,584880,587839,the new 13 plus or the macbook
yLMGzih8CSE,587839,589760,but let's talk about this screen because
yLMGzih8CSE,589760,592080,it is still one of the standout features
yLMGzih8CSE,592080,593680,and there really are only a handful of
yLMGzih8CSE,593680,596000,options out there if you do want an oled
yLMGzih8CSE,596000,597839,display as i say i think the best ones
yLMGzih8CSE,597839,600080,or the best competing ones are from asus
yLMGzih8CSE,600080,602560,with their zenbook lineup now this is a
yLMGzih8CSE,602560,604880,16x10 so you can see here uh with my
yLMGzih8CSE,604880,607440,video going back to a regular 16x9 now
yLMGzih8CSE,607440,609200,just feels old-fashioned actually it's
yLMGzih8CSE,609200,611120,one of my biggest criticisms of the
yLMGzih8CSE,611120,612959,galaxy book 2 pro which i'm also
yLMGzih8CSE,612959,615360,reviewing at the moment and it is a
yLMGzih8CSE,615360,618880,gorgeous screen but still 60 hertz sadly
yLMGzih8CSE,618880,621040,unlike asus zenbooks which are oled and
yLMGzih8CSE,621040,623760,90 hertz it does make this feel a bit
yLMGzih8CSE,623760,625440,slower that performance just doesn't
yLMGzih8CSE,625440,627360,feel like it's there on tap because
yLMGzih8CSE,627360,629839,we're still limited to 60 hertz and also
yLMGzih8CSE,629839,631920,it's not the brightest this oled model
yLMGzih8CSE,631920,635839,tops out at 400 nits and also it's 3.5 k
yLMGzih8CSE,635839,638480,rather than a native 4k resolution the
yLMGzih8CSE,638480,641200,other two led lcd options the non oled
yLMGzih8CSE,641200,643440,versions are actually 500 nits so a
yLMGzih8CSE,643440,645839,little bit brighter and also that 4k
yLMGzih8CSE,645839,647920,plus option will give you that full
yLMGzih8CSE,647920,650079,native 4k res things do get brighter
yLMGzih8CSE,650079,652240,with hdr content though i measured a
yLMGzih8CSE,652240,655040,peak brightness of around 800 nits so i
yLMGzih8CSE,655040,657680,think i would trade the 4k pluses extra
yLMGzih8CSE,657680,660320,pixels and also the extra knits in hdr
yLMGzih8CSE,660320,662079,for that infinite contrast and the
yLMGzih8CSE,662079,664800,punchier colors that you get with oled
yLMGzih8CSE,664800,666399,it is a touchscreen though which is nice
yLMGzih8CSE,666399,667600,and maybe helpful for you if you're
yLMGzih8CSE,667600,669519,doing some digital drawing or
yLMGzih8CSE,669519,671200,note-taking or you know e-signatures
yLMGzih8CSE,671200,672480,that kind of thing
yLMGzih8CSE,672480,675200,but this oled option like the 4k option
yLMGzih8CSE,675200,678320,they're both 200 pound 250
yLMGzih8CSE,678320,681200,upgrades over the standard full hd plus
yLMGzih8CSE,681200,682800,so this does cost more and the other
yLMGzih8CSE,682800,684800,benefit of sticking with full hd is that
yLMGzih8CSE,684800,687279,the battery life will last you about 50
yLMGzih8CSE,687279,690000,longer going to this 3.5 or the 4k
yLMGzih8CSE,690000,692079,options does have a quite a big impact
yLMGzih8CSE,692079,694160,on your battery however the downside of
yLMGzih8CSE,694160,696079,sticking with the cheaper full hd option
yLMGzih8CSE,696079,697600,is that you don't get this sort of edge
yLMGzih8CSE,697600,699600,to edge glass bezel you have a little
yLMGzih8CSE,699600,701040,bit of sort of a plastic protruding
yLMGzih8CSE,701040,703120,bezel doesn't look as nice it's also not
yLMGzih8CSE,703120,705200,as color accurate and it's matte which
yLMGzih8CSE,705200,706800,you may prefer but if you're looking at
yLMGzih8CSE,706800,708880,content and watching movies and editing
yLMGzih8CSE,708880,711120,videos and photos and things the glossy
yLMGzih8CSE,711120,713360,screen is nice to have particularly
yLMGzih8CSE,713360,715279,paired with that oled panel color
yLMGzih8CSE,715279,717120,accuracy is top notch though we're
yLMGzih8CSE,717120,720240,looking at 100 srgb and adobe rgb and
yLMGzih8CSE,720240,722560,high p3 coverage
yLMGzih8CSE,722560,724079,let's talk about battery life though
yLMGzih8CSE,724079,725680,because it does depend on whether you go
yLMGzih8CSE,725680,728880,for the 56 or the bigger 86 watt hour
yLMGzih8CSE,728880,730959,battery and of course also what specs
yLMGzih8CSE,730959,733279,and what screen you go for now here with
yLMGzih8CSE,733279,735279,the larger battery and the oled screen
yLMGzih8CSE,735279,737600,my xbox 15 managed seven and a half
yLMGzih8CSE,737600,740000,hours in my standard full screen video
yLMGzih8CSE,740000,742079,test which to my surprise is a nice
yLMGzih8CSE,742079,743839,little jump from the six hours that i
yLMGzih8CSE,743839,746000,got on last year's model so battery life
yLMGzih8CSE,746000,748720,is about 15 to 20 better this year and
yLMGzih8CSE,748720,750399,so with mixed use i reckon you could
yLMGzih8CSE,750399,752160,easily manage about seven hours out of
yLMGzih8CSE,752160,754240,this less in more demanding tasks and
yLMGzih8CSE,754240,755760,probably an hour and a half of gaming
yLMGzih8CSE,755760,757519,but it is still a definite improvement
yLMGzih8CSE,757519,759360,although if you want the absolute best
yLMGzih8CSE,759360,760639,battery then you're going to want to
yLMGzih8CSE,760639,762560,stick with a full hd screen but also go
yLMGzih8CSE,762560,763920,with a bigger battery that'll probably
yLMGzih8CSE,763920,766240,get you closer to 12 hours
yLMGzih8CSE,766240,767760,so far we've barely even talked about
yLMGzih8CSE,767760,770240,the actual main upgrade this year the
yLMGzih8CSE,770240,773200,cpu so let's see how fast this is and in
yLMGzih8CSE,773200,775120,my benchmarks we can see that while the
yLMGzih8CSE,775120,777120,single core speeds are slightly better
yLMGzih8CSE,777120,779200,than last year there is a definite step
yLMGzih8CSE,779200,781760,up in multi-core results nothing major
yLMGzih8CSE,781760,783360,but alongside the slightly longer
yLMGzih8CSE,783360,785760,battery it's a definite win and as you
yLMGzih8CSE,785760,787600,would expect it's plenty fast enough for
yLMGzih8CSE,787600,790000,some demanding 4k editing in premiere
yLMGzih8CSE,790000,792880,pro and batch photo editing in lightroom
yLMGzih8CSE,792880,794560,it's pretty much workstation level which
yLMGzih8CSE,794560,796399,again is very impressive given just how
yLMGzih8CSE,796399,797839,slim this is
yLMGzih8CSE,797839,800000,okay moving on to the gpu in this case
yLMGzih8CSE,800000,802320,the 3050 ti and it's worth saying that
yLMGzih8CSE,802320,805600,this is a 45 watt gpu rather than the 75
yLMGzih8CSE,805600,807200,watt versions that you may find in some
yLMGzih8CSE,807200,809200,of the laptops and coupled with only
yLMGzih8CSE,809200,811200,four gigs of vram and of course that
yLMGzih8CSE,811200,813440,fairly major down clock versus the 350
yLMGzih8CSE,813440,816000,ti in last year's xps 15 means that
yLMGzih8CSE,816000,818320,while gaming potential is there it's
yLMGzih8CSE,818320,820800,nothing special so i must admit it was
yLMGzih8CSE,820800,823440,kind of a surprise that at 1200 p the
yLMGzih8CSE,823440,826480,new cpu actually offsets the slower gpu
yLMGzih8CSE,826480,828880,making big gains in rainbow six siege
yLMGzih8CSE,828880,830320,with a more modest improvement in
yLMGzih8CSE,830320,832480,fortnite but annoyingly that underclock
yLMGzih8CSE,832480,835199,wipes out any more meaningful games
yLMGzih8CSE,835199,838320,but next to the xbs17 with its 3060 the
yLMGzih8CSE,838320,840880,15 here very much comes in second place
yLMGzih8CSE,840880,842720,and not just in terms of frame rates the
yLMGzih8CSE,842720,845279,cooling is also much better on the 17 to
yLMGzih8CSE,845279,847279,match his components and so while
yLMGzih8CSE,847279,849199,otherwise this is a very well-rounded
yLMGzih8CSE,849199,851600,and very polished laptop i think my one
yLMGzih8CSE,851600,854000,criticism really aside from perhaps not
yLMGzih8CSE,854000,855920,being the most interesting this year is
yLMGzih8CSE,855920,858880,the fans and the cooling it gets hot and
yLMGzih8CSE,858880,861040,it gets loud in fact if we take another
yLMGzih8CSE,861040,863600,look inside you can see the 17's vapor
yLMGzih8CSE,863600,865519,chamber cooler is significantly bigger
yLMGzih8CSE,865519,867680,than the 15s the fans on this seem to
yLMGzih8CSE,867680,869600,come in even under minimal loads and it
yLMGzih8CSE,869600,871920,can get pretty loud and actually in my
yLMGzih8CSE,871920,874079,stress test using the optimized and also
yLMGzih8CSE,874079,876399,the high performance modes the cpu jumps
yLMGzih8CSE,876399,879360,up as high as 75 to 95 watts and also
yLMGzih8CSE,879360,882160,hits 100 degrees celsius at the initial
yLMGzih8CSE,882160,884480,load before then gradually throttling
yLMGzih8CSE,884480,886480,back over the next minute or so then
yLMGzih8CSE,886480,888320,both this and the clock speeds just drop
yLMGzih8CSE,888320,890399,off a cliff the only advantage of this
yLMGzih8CSE,890399,892240,quite serious throttling is that the
yLMGzih8CSE,892240,894480,fans quieten down but this does mean
yLMGzih8CSE,894480,896720,that sustained performance is severely
yLMGzih8CSE,896720,898880,curved after only a minute or so which
yLMGzih8CSE,898880,900959,isn't the case with a 17 and the
yLMGzih8CSE,900959,902399,difference is even more stark when you
yLMGzih8CSE,902399,904639,compare it to say the macbook pro 14 or
yLMGzih8CSE,904639,906720,16 which just never really gets
yLMGzih8CSE,906720,909279,flustered and stays almost silent the
yLMGzih8CSE,909279,910839,whole time even under
yLMGzih8CSE,910839,913199,load look at that
yLMGzih8CSE,913199,914720,that's terrible
yLMGzih8CSE,914720,916880,i appreciate how thin the bezels are and
yLMGzih8CSE,916880,918399,we have faith unlocking and it's
yLMGzih8CSE,918399,920320,actually now separate the ir camera and
yLMGzih8CSE,920320,921600,the main selfie camera here for the
yLMGzih8CSE,921600,924320,webcam selfie webcam but the quality is
yLMGzih8CSE,924320,925600,terrible
yLMGzih8CSE,925600,927519,look at that so noisy and this is
yLMGzih8CSE,927519,929519,actually some decent lighting if i go
yLMGzih8CSE,929519,932480,around to the window
yLMGzih8CSE,933040,935519,yeah not good at all come on dale you
yLMGzih8CSE,935519,937680,can do better
yLMGzih8CSE,937680,939680,but i wouldn't say any of those are deal
yLMGzih8CSE,939680,942560,breakers i wish this had 90 hertz i wish
yLMGzih8CSE,942560,944320,they had done a bit of a design update
yLMGzih8CSE,944320,946000,even not just from an aesthetic point of
yLMGzih8CSE,946000,947920,view but to give it a bit better cooling
yLMGzih8CSE,947920,949759,so we get better sustained performance
yLMGzih8CSE,949759,951279,it's still incredibly powerful but i
yLMGzih8CSE,951279,953279,just would like it to be a bit less
yLMGzih8CSE,953279,955199,throttly and also when you do see the
yLMGzih8CSE,955199,958480,likes of the zenbook pro 16x oled i
yLMGzih8CSE,958480,961040,think that's the right name uh with its
yLMGzih8CSE,961040,963279,little dial built in and it's 90 hertz
yLMGzih8CSE,963279,965680,oled screen just little bits of you know
yLMGzih8CSE,965680,967279,innovation and of course what we're
yLMGzih8CSE,967279,969440,seeing with the macbooks as well well
yLMGzih8CSE,969440,971440,this is still a great laptop and if you
yLMGzih8CSE,971440,973040,can get it on a sale
yLMGzih8CSE,973040,974720,definitely worth considering it just
yLMGzih8CSE,974720,977120,feels a little bit boring this year and
yLMGzih8CSE,977120,978320,actually going back to i said the
yLMGzih8CSE,978320,980160,beginning if you can find a good deal on
yLMGzih8CSE,980160,982079,last year's model while you will lose
yLMGzih8CSE,982079,984000,out on the slightly faster cpu and the
yLMGzih8CSE,984000,986320,slightly longer battery life aside from
yLMGzih8CSE,986320,987839,that it's not really a big deal and you
yLMGzih8CSE,987839,989759,could save a whole bunch of money so
yLMGzih8CSE,989759,991199,this is still fine especially if you're
yLMGzih8CSE,991199,993519,upgrading from a three four year or
yLMGzih8CSE,993519,995920,older laptop but certainly not worth it
yLMGzih8CSE,995920,997120,if you've got one for the last couple of
yLMGzih8CSE,997120,998720,years and i still think last year's
yLMGzih8CSE,998720,1000560,model is probably a better option
yLMGzih8CSE,1000560,1002560,overall but what do you think are you an
yLMGzih8CSE,1002560,1004639,xps 15 owner let me know what you make
