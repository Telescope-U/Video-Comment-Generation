tZa4hs1MY3Y,0,1680,i want to bring in abc's alex prashay in
tZa4hs1MY3Y,1680,4000,washington for more on this alex cassidy
tZa4hs1MY3Y,4000,5839,hutchinson testified that mark meadows
tZa4hs1MY3Y,5839,8800,said days ahead of time that january 6
tZa4hs1MY3Y,8800,10880,could get quote real real bad
tZa4hs1MY3Y,10880,13040,she said trump knew his supporters were
tZa4hs1MY3Y,13040,14480,armed he tried to get metal detectors
tZa4hs1MY3Y,14480,15920,turned off so that they could join the
tZa4hs1MY3Y,15920,16960,rally
tZa4hs1MY3Y,16960,19119,and that he wanted to lead them to the
tZa4hs1MY3Y,19119,21600,capital himself how are lawmakers
tZa4hs1MY3Y,21600,23680,reacting to that
tZa4hs1MY3Y,23680,25599,well diamond we knew that cassidy
tZa4hs1MY3Y,25599,27920,hutchinson was going to act
tZa4hs1MY3Y,27920,30320,as the the dot connector in this
tZa4hs1MY3Y,30320,33440,narrative she had a perspective that uh
tZa4hs1MY3Y,33440,36399,many folks did not being uh
tZa4hs1MY3Y,36399,38160,working with the former chief of staff
tZa4hs1MY3Y,38160,40000,and also uh having access to the
tZa4hs1MY3Y,40000,42960,president's calendar and and so frankly
tZa4hs1MY3Y,42960,45280,there's been a lot of shock and i will
tZa4hs1MY3Y,45280,46960,say it's bipartisan certainly you would
tZa4hs1MY3Y,46960,48800,expect that from democrats but but even
tZa4hs1MY3Y,48800,51520,yesterday we heard from republican
tZa4hs1MY3Y,51520,54800,lawmakers specifically john curtis uh of
tZa4hs1MY3Y,54800,58079,of utah who said that this testimony was
tZa4hs1MY3Y,58079,60960,sobering and so yes there is going to be
tZa4hs1MY3Y,60960,64478,a a a picking apart in a re-dissecting
tZa4hs1MY3Y,64478,66320,of of her words from yesterday in the
tZa4hs1MY3Y,66320,68640,coming days but at least right now i
tZa4hs1MY3Y,68640,70159,mean her testimony was very very
tZa4hs1MY3Y,70159,72159,powerful and it's striking a court
tZa4hs1MY3Y,72159,74320,and now alex the secret service i mean
tZa4hs1MY3Y,74320,76400,secret literally the first word in in
tZa4hs1MY3Y,76400,78720,what they do they are very big on
tZa4hs1MY3Y,78720,80720,privacy and yet we're now hearing that
tZa4hs1MY3Y,80720,82880,secret service agents may
tZa4hs1MY3Y,82880,85360,testify uh to push back against some of
tZa4hs1MY3Y,85360,87439,what hutchinson said happened in the
tZa4hs1MY3Y,87439,89759,president's motorcade how significant is
tZa4hs1MY3Y,89759,92000,that and how is
tZa4hs1MY3Y,92000,95119,how is her credibility um weighing out
tZa4hs1MY3Y,95119,96479,now that there's been a little bit of
tZa4hs1MY3Y,96479,98400,time after her testimony well diane i
tZa4hs1MY3Y,98400,99600,mean so i think that's that's the big
tZa4hs1MY3Y,99600,102320,thing i mean is this witness credible
tZa4hs1MY3Y,102320,104320,and certainly if the secret service has
tZa4hs1MY3Y,104320,107040,uh uh uh agents that are that are ready
tZa4hs1MY3Y,107040,108799,to testify and push back against that
tZa4hs1MY3Y,108799,111040,account uh you know that would go
tZa4hs1MY3Y,111040,113840,towards the argument of of uh that that
tZa4hs1MY3Y,113840,115920,some in within trump's inner circle have
tZa4hs1MY3Y,115920,117360,said that you know this witness cassidy
tZa4hs1MY3Y,117360,120719,hutchinson is not a credible person uh
tZa4hs1MY3Y,120719,122719,i'd keep in mind that this was a second
tZa4hs1MY3Y,122719,125439,hand account that uh that she was
tZa4hs1MY3Y,125439,127439,discussing yesterday and testifying
tZa4hs1MY3Y,127439,130560,towards but also it doesn't take away
tZa4hs1MY3Y,130560,132160,from the fact
tZa4hs1MY3Y,132160,134000,her knowledge her first hand knowledge
tZa4hs1MY3Y,134000,136560,about that off the record travel plan
tZa4hs1MY3Y,136560,139200,for the president to get inside that suv
tZa4hs1MY3Y,139200,141520,and go to the capitol that is something
tZa4hs1MY3Y,141520,143040,that she had knowledge with and
tZa4hs1MY3Y,143040,145440,certainly uh this this this incident
tZa4hs1MY3Y,145440,147680,this alleged incident with his uh the
tZa4hs1MY3Y,147680,149840,secret service agent ingle who was
tZa4hs1MY3Y,149840,151360,protecting the president
tZa4hs1MY3Y,151360,153040,that that's certainly one of the more
tZa4hs1MY3Y,153040,155599,inflammatory anecdotes from yesterday's
tZa4hs1MY3Y,155599,157760,testimony but i think also
tZa4hs1MY3Y,157760,160239,the fact was the the the the committee
tZa4hs1MY3Y,160239,162080,is trying to connect the dots between
tZa4hs1MY3Y,162080,164319,the president marching with these
tZa4hs1MY3Y,164319,166480,rioters up to the capitol and that is
tZa4hs1MY3Y,166480,168720,something uh that cassidy hudson had
tZa4hs1MY3Y,168720,170879,first-hand knowledge of and testify too
tZa4hs1MY3Y,170879,173040,effectively all right alex prashay thank
