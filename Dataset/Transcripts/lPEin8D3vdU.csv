lPEin8D3vdU,117119,119119,a receptacle what is that this machine
lPEin8D3vdU,119119,120880,behind me then they're conveyor belted
lPEin8D3vdU,120880,122880,up until they plop into the peeler it's
lPEin8D3vdU,122880,125600,a belt fed conveyor system that has a
lPEin8D3vdU,125600,127280,very particular amount of potatoes that

lPEin8D3vdU,144400,146800,fryer taking this big bulbous beauty and
lPEin8D3vdU,146800,148879,instantly smashing it into uniform
lPEin8D3vdU,148879,151360,starch rods we're looking for a crispier
lPEin8D3vdU,151360,153200,exterior and kind of a baked potato
lPEin8D3vdU,153200,154840,inside so we're kind of looking for that
lPEin8D3vdU,154840,157680,centimeter fish range centimeter very
lPEin8D3vdU,157680,159280,european
lPEin8D3vdU,159280,161440,the raw fries are loaded into the frying
lPEin8D3vdU,161440,163760,basket first they get fried in hot oil
lPEin8D3vdU,163760,167200,that cooks them through evenly
lPEin8D3vdU,167440,169120,then they're moved to even hotter oil
lPEin8D3vdU,169120,171280,which gives the fries a crispy crunchy
lPEin8D3vdU,171280,173840,exterior finally the hottest oil of them
lPEin8D3vdU,173840,176239,all ensures the crunch lasts as long as
lPEin8D3vdU,176239,178000,possible we end up having them drained
lPEin8D3vdU,178000,179599,and then they're dumped right behind you
lPEin8D3vdU,179599,181360,and then lightly dusted with salt or
lPEin8D3vdU,181360,183680,vinegar or ketchup

lPEin8D3vdU,238840,241760,out oh that's very satisfying so just a
lPEin8D3vdU,241760,243120,little bit of crunch on the outside
lPEin8D3vdU,243120,244319,there's just a little bit of salt on
lPEin8D3vdU,244319,245680,there and it's just so much different
lPEin8D3vdU,245680,247439,from like a mcdonald's french fry that
lPEin8D3vdU,247439,249040,would be much thinner more crunchy but
lPEin8D3vdU,249040,250799,it wouldn't have this really satisfying
lPEin8D3vdU,250799,253920,mashy steamy starchy center like this
lPEin8D3vdU,253920,256160,has i gotta try some ketchup i'm gonna
lPEin8D3vdU,256160,259199,get a triple fry it's more surface area
lPEin8D3vdU,259199,261519,it's gonna really grab onto this ketchup
lPEin8D3vdU,261519,263199,look at that it's like a torch in the
lPEin8D3vdU,263199,264760,night let's try it out
lPEin8D3vdU,264760,267520,[Music]
lPEin8D3vdU,267520,269360,no i would recommend don't start with a
lPEin8D3vdU,269360,270479,ketchup because then you're going to be
lPEin8D3vdU,270479,271919,giving your palate a little too much
lPEin8D3vdU,271919,273759,razzle dazzle start plain just the
lPEin8D3vdU,273759,275600,potato just the salt and then when your
lPEin8D3vdU,275600,277280,padlet grows weary you can add some
lPEin8D3vdU,277280,279199,ketchup this today is my breakfast we're

lPEin8D3vdU,299040,301520,fortune

lPEin8D3vdU,322160,324000,brad riebart who up with the minnesota
lPEin8D3vdU,324000,325759,state fair where his family ran a
lPEin8D3vdU,325759,328400,sanitation business for over 68 years
lPEin8D3vdU,328400,330560,brad got the idea for selling corn from
lPEin8D3vdU,330560,332880,another fair in nearby wisconsin i tried
lPEin8D3vdU,332880,334240,it for the first time i've never seen
lPEin8D3vdU,334240,336080,roasted corn in my life i took a bite
lPEin8D3vdU,336080,337919,turn around bought another one so good
lPEin8D3vdU,337919,339919,but before we could turn this idea into
lPEin8D3vdU,339919,341600,a dream business he had a lot of
lPEin8D3vdU,341600,343360,convincing to do everybody told me
lPEin8D3vdU,343360,345199,nobody's gonna buy sweet corn it won't
lPEin8D3vdU,345199,346960,sell but it took five years for the fair
lPEin8D3vdU,346960,349600,to approve the idea wow to approve corn
lPEin8D3vdU,349600,351360,they're like listen guys this guy has a
lPEin8D3vdU,351360,353520,radical idea corn and that took five
lPEin8D3vdU,353520,355039,years to approve
lPEin8D3vdU,355039,357280,there are 12 000 different species of
lPEin8D3vdU,357280,358800,corn in the world and that's not
lPEin8D3vdU,358800,361360,counting deep sea underwater corn
lPEin8D3vdU,361360,363440,but minnesota is well known for its
lPEin8D3vdU,363440,365919,sweet corn very tender very sweet this
lPEin8D3vdU,365919,368080,seed actually comes from japan oh really
lPEin8D3vdU,368080,369199,yeah
lPEin8D3vdU,369199,371039,although the seeds flew in from japan
lPEin8D3vdU,371039,373360,this corn was grown here in minnesota
lPEin8D3vdU,373360,375280,specifically for this event i'm curious
lPEin8D3vdU,375280,376800,how much you sell in a good year you can
lPEin8D3vdU,376800,378720,measure it however you want like bathtub
lPEin8D3vdU,378720,380160,pools is what i usually use for
lPEin8D3vdU,380160,381759,measurements you want to put it that way
lPEin8D3vdU,381759,383759,we're probably doing 600 bathtubs a
lPEin8D3vdU,383759,385919,night wow that's a lot of bathtubs of
lPEin8D3vdU,385919,386890,course

lPEin8D3vdU,390560,392240,corn and slide it down to the soaking
lPEin8D3vdU,392240,394240,tub try to keep the corn refrigerated
lPEin8D3vdU,394240,395919,first to keep the starch from building
lPEin8D3vdU,395919,398160,up here it soaks for 10 to 15 minutes
lPEin8D3vdU,398160,400000,before it moves to the grill we get real
lPEin8D3vdU,400000,401680,busy it might not hit the water very
lPEin8D3vdU,401680,402800,long
lPEin8D3vdU,402800,404880,this custom-made gas grill was built
lPEin8D3vdU,404880,407120,specifically for this operation ensuring
lPEin8D3vdU,407120,409120,a nice even heat and pinpoint
lPEin8D3vdU,409120,410720,caramelization i don't think i've ever

lPEin8D3vdU,412319,414240,caramelized piece of sweet corn so i
lPEin8D3vdU,414240,416560,definitely want to try that today
lPEin8D3vdU,416560,418800,add water to steam the corn or maybe
lPEin8D3vdU,418800,420319,they're just doing that for the cameras
lPEin8D3vdU,420319,423759,i'm not sure once cooked husk it and dip

lPEin8D3vdU,442400,444560,corn in my hands right now on one side
lPEin8D3vdU,444560,446400,it's kind of rare on the other side it's
lPEin8D3vdU,446400,448400,a more medium well so you have a variety
lPEin8D3vdU,448400,450479,of textures and flavors here and he said
lPEin8D3vdU,450479,452560,it actually caramelizes the sugars
lPEin8D3vdU,452560,454319,inside so that should create a really
lPEin8D3vdU,454319,456560,new unique type of taste i'm gonna go
lPEin8D3vdU,456560,458160,for it i don't where do you start do you

lPEin8D3vdU,479120,480560,don't want to overdo the butter i've
lPEin8D3vdU,480560,482240,seen people who have destroyed their
lPEin8D3vdU,482240,484639,palates through years of junk food abuse
lPEin8D3vdU,484639,486319,it needs to be literally half butter for
lPEin8D3vdU,486319,488319,them to enjoy it but here they just give
lPEin8D3vdU,488319,490160,it a little bit of a dip not a lot a bit

lPEin8D3vdU,537839,539600,traveling but in order to roast up this
lPEin8D3vdU,539600,542000,beautiful turkey leg bounty they had to
lPEin8D3vdU,542000,543519,go mobile
lPEin8D3vdU,543519,545760,this turkey mobile drives from here to
lPEin8D3vdU,545760,547360,florida when it's parked up and ready
lPEin8D3vdU,547360,549440,this roaming rotisserie can roast up to
lPEin8D3vdU,549440,552000,700 legs at once that's my kind of food
lPEin8D3vdU,552000,553040,truck
lPEin8D3vdU,553040,555600,how much does it cost for one costs 15
lPEin8D3vdU,555600,557519,that seems very reasonable it's huge
lPEin8D3vdU,557519,559440,it's protein packed it's a lot of food
lPEin8D3vdU,559440,560959,do you see people trying to go at this
lPEin8D3vdU,560959,563200,by themselves are they sharing it among
lPEin8D3vdU,563200,564880,a small community of people a lot of
lPEin8D3vdU,564880,566560,times a family will come up with five
lPEin8D3vdU,566560,568560,and they might order three to five if
lPEin8D3vdU,568560,570080,you look at them out there there's
lPEin8D3vdU,570080,572000,nothing left on the bone usually the
lPEin8D3vdU,572000,573839,only time you'll see a turkey leg whole
lPEin8D3vdU,573839,575279,is thanksgiving how many of these are
lPEin8D3vdU,575279,577120,you selling during the whole minnesota
lPEin8D3vdU,577120,578800,state fair and in that case you gotta
lPEin8D3vdU,578800,580399,share it with your already buzzed-up
lPEin8D3vdU,580399,582480,uncle sonny we usually bring a semi-load
lPEin8D3vdU,582480,584640,in what is it mike eight or nine hundred
lPEin8D3vdU,584640,586880,here it's just you and this flintstone
lPEin8D3vdU,586880,589120,sized bird leg a fair snack that became
lPEin8D3vdU,589120,591440,popular at disney we use the same turkey
lPEin8D3vdU,591440,593040,leg that disney world does so this is
lPEin8D3vdU,593040,594959,the exact same turkey leg from the exact
lPEin8D3vdU,594959,596800,same company in tampa florida so it's
lPEin8D3vdU,596800,598640,already cooked when you get it exactly
lPEin8D3vdU,598640,600160,why do you choose to do it that way and
lPEin8D3vdU,600160,601519,have you always done it that way i've
lPEin8D3vdU,601519,603760,just not found that the raw turkey leg
lPEin8D3vdU,603760,606000,is as good of a tasty turkey you're
lPEin8D3vdU,606000,609519,talking about eating a turkey leg raw
lPEin8D3vdU,609600,611680,the process starts with their pre-smoked
lPEin8D3vdU,611680,614000,turkey legs these plus-sized thighs
lPEin8D3vdU,614000,615920,roast in the turkey trailer for one to
lPEin8D3vdU,615920,616839,two
lPEin8D3vdU,616839,620160,hours you go through 200 cases in a day
lPEin8D3vdU,620160,622240,you don't have time to cook from raw
lPEin8D3vdU,622240,623920,then they're moved to the grill to crisp
lPEin8D3vdU,623920,626320,up the skin and the raw does not taste
lPEin8D3vdU,626320,628720,like ham these taste more like hands
lPEin8D3vdU,628720,630640,finally wrap it in tin foil to keep it
lPEin8D3vdU,630640,632560,hot and served
lPEin8D3vdU,632560,634079,today i've basically been eating like a
lPEin8D3vdU,634079,636640,vegetarian french fries corn but now
lPEin8D3vdU,636640,638720,it's time for some meat
lPEin8D3vdU,638720,640959,here look at this a big beautiful turkey
lPEin8D3vdU,640959,643360,leg all nestled up in swaddling clothes
lPEin8D3vdU,643360,645200,like the baby turkey jesus i think they
lPEin8D3vdU,645200,647040,put tin foil on there to help preserve
lPEin8D3vdU,647040,648800,the keep we're going to totally peel
lPEin8D3vdU,648800,651839,that back like a beautiful meaty banana
lPEin8D3vdU,651839,654240,yes this is a giant leg this must have
lPEin8D3vdU,654240,656720,been one beast of a bird
lPEin8D3vdU,656720,659040,it smells good it's both smoky fatty
lPEin8D3vdU,659040,661240,greasy let's go for it
lPEin8D3vdU,661240,664679,[Music]
lPEin8D3vdU,664800,667040,it's so hot it's so juicy it just slides
lPEin8D3vdU,667040,669440,right down it's oily it's fatty but it
lPEin8D3vdU,669440,671519,actually has more of a hammy taste to it
lPEin8D3vdU,671519,673200,than a turkey taste i'm not sure why a
lPEin8D3vdU,673200,674959,hammy flavor is so desired but i think
lPEin8D3vdU,674959,676399,that's what happens when you smoke the
lPEin8D3vdU,676399,678000,meat it just gives it more of a cured
lPEin8D3vdU,678000,679839,kind of flavor to it
lPEin8D3vdU,679839,683040,oh yes now this is just a pure skin shot
lPEin8D3vdU,683040,685430,right here i'm going to pop that back
lPEin8D3vdU,685430,686880,[Music]
lPEin8D3vdU,686880,688160,it's just a whole different texture a
lPEin8D3vdU,688160,690160,whole different flavor very desirable
lPEin8D3vdU,690160,691839,that's what you want
lPEin8D3vdU,691839,693360,all right so right here guys this part
lPEin8D3vdU,693360,694800,of the turkey leg is like a release
lPEin8D3vdU,694800,697279,valve i'm going to pull that back yes
lPEin8D3vdU,697279,699200,bingo look at the inside of this that
lPEin8D3vdU,699200,700399,looks so good i feel like i've been
lPEin8D3vdU,700399,702240,eating for 10 minutes now and i'm not
lPEin8D3vdU,702240,703839,even halfway done with it this is a
lPEin8D3vdU,703839,705519,great value and to imagine they're
lPEin8D3vdU,705519,707680,selling a literal truckload of this
lPEin8D3vdU,707680,709279,every year here at the state fair
lPEin8D3vdU,709279,709840,incredible
lPEin8D3vdU,709840,714480,[Music]
lPEin8D3vdU,714480,716639,every new vendor at this fair hopes to
lPEin8D3vdU,716639,719440,become the next martha a minnesota state
lPEin8D3vdU,719440,721760,fair icon who turned a simple recipe
lPEin8D3vdU,721760,724240,into a million dollar business just by
lPEin8D3vdU,724240,727279,selling cookies
lPEin8D3vdU,727380,729600,[Music]
lPEin8D3vdU,729600,732160,martha yes put her there okay meet the
lPEin8D3vdU,732160,734320,queen of this cookie dough kingdom sweet
lPEin8D3vdU,734320,736399,martha she and her business partners
lPEin8D3vdU,736399,738880,started with a tiny cookie stand over 40
lPEin8D3vdU,738880,741519,years she built it into a cookie empire
lPEin8D3vdU,741519,743120,it's all just one thing on the menu
lPEin8D3vdU,743120,744880,right that's right and that's genius
lPEin8D3vdU,744880,746560,about what you do here because a lot of
lPEin8D3vdU,746560,748240,people might think oh i should have six
lPEin8D3vdU,748240,750480,or seven really good things or you take
lPEin8D3vdU,750480,752800,one thing and really perfect it and make
lPEin8D3vdU,752800,755360,a lot of it absolutely so for you in a
lPEin8D3vdU,755360,757680,really good year like 2019 do you know
lPEin8D3vdU,757680,760560,about how many cookies you sold in 2019
lPEin8D3vdU,760560,762639,we probably sold at least about three
lPEin8D3vdU,762639,764880,million cookies a day
lPEin8D3vdU,764880,766959,their super secret cookie recipe is an
lPEin8D3vdU,766959,768959,amalgam of several mother's recipes
lPEin8D3vdU,768959,770560,they've got the same great taste from
lPEin8D3vdU,770560,772800,day one but over time small adjustments
lPEin8D3vdU,772800,774480,were made to the recipe so it's better
lPEin8D3vdU,774480,776480,suited to cooking at such a large scale
lPEin8D3vdU,776480,777760,let's talk about the recipe can you
lPEin8D3vdU,777760,779760,write it down exactly for me well i
lPEin8D3vdU,779760,782320,would not do that no okay that's fine
lPEin8D3vdU,782320,784480,[Music]
lPEin8D3vdU,784480,786399,martha's cookies start with their secret
lPEin8D3vdU,786399,788000,dry mix what is more secret the
lPEin8D3vdU,788000,790079,ingredients or the ratio then add
lPEin8D3vdU,790079,792399,shortening and water probably both
lPEin8D3vdU,792399,793839,probably both okay i'm going to guess
lPEin8D3vdU,793839,795680,when the mixture is combined it's time
lPEin8D3vdU,795680,797360,for the chocolate chips flour yeah
lPEin8D3vdU,797360,799440,there's flour pickle juice no i don't
lPEin8D3vdU,799440,801680,think i'm already messing it up
lPEin8D3vdU,801680,803680,all this goes into a dolloping machine
lPEin8D3vdU,803680,805680,which portions this giant glob of cookie
lPEin8D3vdU,805680,807680,dough into perfect cookie sized chunks
lPEin8D3vdU,807680,811360,and spreads them on a baking tray
lPEin8D3vdU,811440,813200,the chunks are manually spread out to
lPEin8D3vdU,813200,815760,create enough space for each cookie
lPEin8D3vdU,815760,817519,when the tray is ready it's placed on a
lPEin8D3vdU,817519,818360,cooking rack
lPEin8D3vdU,818360,820880,[Music]
lPEin8D3vdU,820880,823040,this whole rack goes into the oven for
lPEin8D3vdU,823040,824959,10 to 12 minutes depending on the
lPEin8D3vdU,824959,827279,weather basically we have all open
lPEin8D3vdU,827279,829360,windows around here so we're sort of
lPEin8D3vdU,829360,831440,working outside so the humidity could
lPEin8D3vdU,831440,833350,affect the cooking exactly
lPEin8D3vdU,833350,836160,[Music]
lPEin8D3vdU,836160,837760,when the cookies come out of the oven
lPEin8D3vdU,837760,839839,they're still too gooey to eat they need
lPEin8D3vdU,839839,841839,a quick rest before they're served in a
lPEin8D3vdU,841839,844000,cone or a bucket is it still going to be
lPEin8D3vdU,844000,846240,warm when i bite into it yes that's what
lPEin8D3vdU,846240,847519,we time
lPEin8D3vdU,847519,849680,piled high and served to eager crowds
lPEin8D3vdU,849680,851600,who might only get to try this treat
lPEin8D3vdU,851600,853279,once a year all over the fair you can
lPEin8D3vdU,853279,854639,see people walking around with these
