QYVyjS-Ky9E,259,2093,(mumbling)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,2093,3837,(plates clattering)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,3837,6420,(upbeat music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,10680,12210,"- Hello, welcome to the channel."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,12210,13320,- Today. I'm hungry.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,13320,16049,"So I've asked our normal home cooks Jamie and Barry,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,16049,18419,to shop local and buy me lunch.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,18420,21390,"Hopefully they can find something delicious, new, exciting"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,21390,22223,and most of all
QYVyjS-Ky9E,22223,24449,that celebrates London's diverse food scene.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,24450,27030,- And then they say the fame hasn't gone to his head.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,27030,28380,- There's gonna be three rounds.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,28380,30000,"Round number one, story."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,30000,31860,I want a dish with a talking point.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,31860,33720,"Two, Instagram ability."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,33720,37170,You are gonna vote on which dish you think is most enticing.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,37170,38730,"And three, originality."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,38730,41130,Hopefully to find a dish that I've never tried
QYVyjS-Ky9E,41130,43440,or possibly even heard of before.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,43440,44399,- That's a challenge.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,44400,45767,- I'm going straight for a big mac.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,45767,46710,- (chuckles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,46710,48690,I know he's not had one of those before.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,48690,50219,- I'm gonna give you some time to research.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,50220,52770,A £50 budget each.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,52770,53603,Off you go.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,54699,58785,"- Speny, £100 on a lunch mate. Look at you!"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,58785,61770,(exciting music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,61770,64860,The thing with Ebbers is everyone thinks he
QYVyjS-Ky9E,64860,67260,knows everything including himself.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,67260,69697,- Yes. Find something that Ebbers has never eaten before.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,69697,71636,"""Oh , I've eaten everything""."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,71636,73200,(exciting music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,73200,75299,- I've got one solid idea.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,75300,77370,The others are sketchy.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,77370,79440,"- Instagram category,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,79440,82796,completely depends on what turns up and how it turns up.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,82796,83732,"- Oh, it's lethal."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,85553,88140,(upbeat music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,88140,91110,Let's get started this first round isn't easy.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,91110,93780,"Jamie, you're up first. Tell us your story."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,93780,97022,"- Ebbers you love a story, please lift the cloche."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,98024,99365,- (chuckles) - What the?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,99365,100198,(camera clicking)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,100198,103409,- What you have in front of you is cevapcici.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,103410,106590,This is considered to be the national dish
QYVyjS-Ky9E,106590,108719,of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,108720,109553,Romania.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,109553,110386,- [Barry] What?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,110386,111219,- [Jamie] And Serbia.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,111219,113040,- They all share one national dish?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,113040,117630,- Yes. This is an incredibly popular street food item
QYVyjS-Ky9E,117630,118469,in the Balkans.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,118470,122400,"Which is kind of Southeast Europe, fairly recent invention,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,122400,125520,they reckon around 1860 or so from Serbia.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,125520,128670,The guy reformed Serbian hamburgers
QYVyjS-Ky9E,128670,133080,into the kofta shape and became incredibly successful.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,133080,135600,People started asking them all times of the day and night
QYVyjS-Ky9E,135600,138660,"even for breakfast, is how the story goes."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,138660,141750,- I have no idea how you're supposed to eat it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,141750,142740,"The fact that it's on a flatbread,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,142740,143573,part of me just wants
QYVyjS-Ky9E,143573,144969,to roll the whole thing up. - Yeah.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,144969,145801,(chuckles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,145802,147270,- And yet picking around the different bits.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,147270,150483,Those little koftery things with three different meats.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,151830,152670,Delicious.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,152670,154980,- Would you say that they're quite moist?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,154980,156150,"- They've got a lot of the, the fat."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,156150,157170,So I think the fattiness
QYVyjS-Ky9E,157170,160050,of the three different meats comes through
QYVyjS-Ky9E,160050,163980,"but there's also a really fiery kick from that red sauce,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,163980,166050,which is slightly different to that red sauce
QYVyjS-Ky9E,166050,167730,"which is I think the aubergine one, right?"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,167730,169050,- That'll be the aubergine and paprika.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,169050,169883,"I think the,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,169883,172409,the fiery one will be the extra chilli sauce
QYVyjS-Ky9E,172410,173340,that I ordered for it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,173340,174172,"- Oh, gotcha."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,174173,175821,Yeah. A standard Jamie move.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,175821,176653,(exciting music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,176654,178167,"- It pays to all the senses, I like it."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,178167,181920,"- And just so you know, the pedigree of this dish,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,181920,184080,this was produced by the Hungry Tummy.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,184080,185150,- [Ben] Sounds like I've eat-
QYVyjS-Ky9E,185150,185982,(camera flashing clicks)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,185983,187740,- Place in London that specialises
QYVyjS-Ky9E,187740,189720,in Eastern European cuisine.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,189720,191580,I thought that would be perfect
QYVyjS-Ky9E,191580,192413,for you.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,192413,194280,"In your face, your turn!"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,194280,195543,What's your story?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,196590,197422,- Interesting approach.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,197423,199470,- I love it. I love a national dish.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,199470,200640,I'd not heard of that one.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,200640,202200,It's super tasty.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,202200,203069,I learned a lot.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,203070,205773,"- Ben, please left your cloche."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,206730,208443,- Dish number two.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,208443,209340,(rock music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,209340,210172,- There you go.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,210173,212016,That's exactly the reaction I was looking for.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,212016,213120,- [Ben] Whoa!
QYVyjS-Ky9E,213120,217260,"- In front of you, you have a starter, a main and a side"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,217260,218610,of a focaccia.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,218610,221160,Open them up and tell us what you find.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,221160,223410,"- You know I'm a fan of things on sticks,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,223410,225330,but I'm also a fan of things in jars.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,225330,226522,- Interesting!
QYVyjS-Ky9E,226522,227355,(camera clicking)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,227355,230069,"These jars are from Gado, founded in London."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,230070,233550,"They're on a mission to offer the best Italian gastronomy,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,233550,234963,wherever you are.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,234963,235795,(camera clicking)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,235796,238890,Think of it as a celebration of Italian excellence.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,238890,242400,"So first off you've got a wild boar bresaola, and secondly"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,242400,244680,you have a vitello tonnato.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,244680,246840,They all come cold.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,246840,249780,And because this is a takeaway only restaurant.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,249780,252959,And it's all pre-made in the jars every day.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,252960,255612,So it's almost like a cole slaw at the bottom of that.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,255612,256445,(jar thumping)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,256445,258930,- You've gotten coleslaw and cold meat.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,258930,259763,- [Barry] Exactly
QYVyjS-Ky9E,259763,260730,"- Good. I mean, it's for Ben though, not me."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,260730,261562,"- With some bread. I mean,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,261562,263370,this is basic like picnic ready to go.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,263370,265139,"But as a packed lunch,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,265140,267000,suddenly this becomes super interesting.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,267000,268560,- Now please dig into the main
QYVyjS-Ky9E,268560,271230,because this was completely new to me.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,271230,275461,It's veal on a tuna mayo.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,275461,276720,(giggles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,276720,280170,"Essentially, like, are you aware of this?"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,280170,282480,- I've only had it at Angelina's.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,282480,285060,The restaurant in Dawson that fuses Italian
QYVyjS-Ky9E,285060,286680,and Japanese food.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,286680,288479,- It's then topped with apple and sultana.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,288480,290940,To give it more sweetness as well.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,290940,291773,- And the veal
QYVyjS-Ky9E,292670,295290,is served deliciously pink.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,295290,297390,"- So as you can tell, when it comes to Italian food,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,297390,301290,this is fine ish dining in a jar.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,301290,303090,Which is somewhat unusual.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,303090,306040,"And again, the reason that jumped out to me was these jars."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,306930,308430,"There's so much plastic,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,308430,310620,when ordering takeaways.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,310620,313110,These jars are obviously reusable.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,313110,315900,You'd keep them for yourself using them for other things.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,315900,317340,"But actually once you've got 20 of them,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,317340,318173,you can then return them
QYVyjS-Ky9E,318173,320580,and get a discount off your next order.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,320580,321780,- So what's the story?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,321780,324870,- The story is the jars.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,324870,326639,That was the story.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,326640,327870,- I introduced it as a talking point.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,327870,330090,"I said, a category as a story."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,330090,330923,"- Oh, sorry."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,330923,332984,And that's the end of the story.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,332984,334283,- (laughs loudly) - That help?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,335416,336750,(laughs loudly)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,336750,338430,"- I feel like,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,338430,340770,that in itself is a brand new story to me.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,340770,342780,It's a place that I've never been.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,342780,344790,It's a national dish I've never tried.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,344790,346500,It's absolutely delicious.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,346500,350460,"This one, the food is delicious again,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,350460,352830,but it's so unique 'cause in the jars that
QYVyjS-Ky9E,352830,354990,it takes it to a completely different comparison.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,354990,355823,Both great stories.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,355823,357483,"The one that captivated me more,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,358560,359760,is the salad jars.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,359760,362730,Because they're delicious and unique.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,362730,364860,I need to order it several more times
QYVyjS-Ky9E,364860,366931,so I've got enough jars to return them.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,366932,369090,(rock music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,369090,370110,- Time to claw it back.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,370110,371250,"Ebbers,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,371250,372540,open it up.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,372540,374580,- Instagram ability.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,374580,375922,- Ooh.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,375922,377100,(camera clicking) - Ebbers what we have here
QYVyjS-Ky9E,377100,380400,is a baklava ice cream sandwich.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,380400,383186,"I've got you your favourite, pistachio gelato."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,383186,386430,"Biscoff baklava and pistachio baklava,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,386430,389039,and some vanilla gelato as well.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,389040,390170,- Wow.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,390170,392627,"- I also like the fact, if you're pronouncing baklava wrong,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,392627,395040,you've said it wrong about five times.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,395040,395873,- Baklava!.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,395873,398280,Well it's also it's made by the baklava company.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,398280,399720,So let's hope-
QYVyjS-Ky9E,399720,402330,"- You've been saying ""backlarva"" until I said baklava."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,402330,403396,- Oh no you're kidding.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,403396,404229,- (chuckles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,404229,405062,- It's baklava!
QYVyjS-Ky9E,405062,406860,- So we should stress
QYVyjS-Ky9E,406860,409469,that this round isn't up to me to vote.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,409470,412380,- You are currently voting on which one your favourite is.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,412380,414880,The one that you would entice you to eat the most.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,415860,418650,"But in the meantime, we're gonna look at them, taste them."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,418650,420990,Ben's gonna decide what he would've picked.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,420990,422580,- It's irrelevant.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,422580,424022,- You're in charge.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,425160,427500,"- Flavours wise, I'm excited."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,427500,431040,"- Both crispy and chewy, all in one."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,431040,433560,"- So this is from the baklava company,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,433560,436800,they've been there layering there since 2016.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,436800,439680,And people have been loving their baklava.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,439680,442470,Either from the store or getting them delivered.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,442470,447470,"- These have all the textures that you love of baklava,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,447510,449070,but then they've been hit round the head
QYVyjS-Ky9E,449070,452580,with loads of really new quirky flavours.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,452580,456240,"And by new, I mean kind of trending flavours, Biscoff."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,456240,458069,I would almost like to say that's almost Oreo.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,458070,458940,I don't know if it is.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,458940,460170,With a drizzle of chocolate.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,460170,461243,- Basic.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,461243,462076,(beep)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,462076,462909,- It's the Instagram round.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,462909,463742,- I know.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,463742,465180,And you've got Biscoff and Oreo.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,465180,466470,- Let's see if it pays off.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,466470,468390,- It looks filth.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,468390,469473,"- As you can imagine,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,470580,475580,their photography has sent these crazy on Instagram.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,475710,477990,We will wait to find out whether my photography
QYVyjS-Ky9E,477990,479253,has the same effect.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,480480,482310,"- A great choice,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,482310,485220,because it's not something I eat very often.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,485220,487200,"And every time I have baklava I always go,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,487200,488610,why don't I eat this more often?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,488610,490080,"And then this,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,490080,492930,is a real indulgent twist on that.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,492930,496020,That makes it arguably a bit more accessible
QYVyjS-Ky9E,496020,497910,to people who don't know what baklava is.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,497910,499320,This might entice me to try that
QYVyjS-Ky9E,499320,500340,and the classic flavours.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,500340,502203,The gelato also delicious.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,503550,505432,- I'm nervous now.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,505433,507303,"Ebbers, lift the cloche."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,508470,509520,- Ooh.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,509520,514380,- Now I have simultaneously taken a risk
QYVyjS-Ky9E,514380,515820,by playing it safe.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,515820,517680,"These are from Laduree,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,517680,520080,which is a very well established French patisserie.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,520080,520913,I went with them
QYVyjS-Ky9E,520913,524880,cause I know they make the prettiest macarons around.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,524880,528335,And I got the most flamboyant thing on their menu.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,528335,529168,(camera clicking)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,529168,531000,Soft macaron with fresh berries
QYVyjS-Ky9E,531000,533160,and an icing inside.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,533160,534003,"Classic,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,535140,537300,punchy in visuals.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,537300,541019,"And I was thinking the colour, the elegance,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,541020,543270,would get me the views.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,543270,545850,- While this is kind of all the shades
QYVyjS-Ky9E,545850,548310,of golden and beige and brown.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,548310,549660,This is striking.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,549660,552060,"But also I hear you, perhaps a little obvious."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,552060,553260,"- It is obvious,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,553260,556770,but sometimes give the people what they want
QYVyjS-Ky9E,556770,560693,"- Texture wise, perfect for a macaron, lovely."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,560693,563526,(exciting music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,574950,577140,Both photos were uploaded to Instagram
QYVyjS-Ky9E,577140,579900,without any reference to whose was whose.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,579900,582120,Or even what the challenge was.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,582120,584940,The only question was: which is the most enticing?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,584940,588059,It has been live for a period of time.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,588059,591090,- Well Ebbers why don't we get your opinion
QYVyjS-Ky9E,591090,593190,on who you would give the point to?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,593190,595020,And then we'll find out the real winner.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,595020,597273,- Sat here with these in front of me.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,598290,601480,I know which one catches my eye initially
QYVyjS-Ky9E,602430,603960,and that is the brighter colour.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,603960,605930,But I also know which one kind of entices me
QYVyjS-Ky9E,605930,608760,in with curiosity and the one that I would be enticed
QYVyjS-Ky9E,608760,610680,to go back for more of.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,610680,611513,Should we look at the results?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,611513,613800,"I'm nerve, I'm really nervous."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,613800,615720,"If I get this, I'll take the win."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,615720,619740,- With 65% of the votes.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,619740,620821,- Oh!
QYVyjS-Ky9E,620821,621660,- Oh!
QYVyjS-Ky9E,621660,623519,- So pretty much two thirds.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,623520,626040,"- Not quite a landslide, but."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,626040,630446,- You guys have said that the most enticing dish is..
QYVyjS-Ky9E,630446,633707,(drums roaring)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,633707,634540,- (giggles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,634540,636570,- [Ben] Jamie'. - (laughs loudly)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,636570,638760,- The baklava wins it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,638760,640500,"And most of the comments we're saying,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,640500,641730,too obvious.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,641730,645029,Whereas people saying that looks really cool
QYVyjS-Ky9E,645030,646710,and I absolutely want to try it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,646710,649260,"- Barry, how many times is one of my photos beaten yours?"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,649260,650700,- That wasn't the photography challenge!
QYVyjS-Ky9E,650700,652642,"- Well, how many times- - That was enticing foods."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,652642,653475,- has one of my photos-
QYVyjS-Ky9E,653475,654308,- I took a risk.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,654308,655173,It went wrong! - beaten one of yours
QYVyjS-Ky9E,655173,656873,in a challenge?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,656873,659670,(upbeat music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,659670,662550,"- One point each, which means it's all still to play for"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,662550,664950,as we dive into the unknown.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,664950,667350,"- Speaking of the unknown Ebbers,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,667350,669660,please lift my cloche.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,669660,670680,- [Barry] Your cloche?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,670680,671652,- My cloche.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,671652,672485,- What's those? - (chuckles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,672485,674662,- That didn't under the cloche.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,674662,676569,(upbeat music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,676569,679819,(scribbling screeches)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,685643,686476,- Whoa.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,687982,688946,(sniffs)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,688946,690029,What is that?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,691106,692150,- [Barry] I don't know.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,692150,694137,- Ebbers full out originality round.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,694137,698250,I would like to take you to Nigeria.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,698250,699480,- [Ben] I've never been.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,699480,703820,- And I would like to serve you ogbono soup.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,703820,704653,(camera clicking)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,704653,706770,"Otherwise known as draw soup,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,706770,710025,which is served with pounded yam.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,710025,710858,(camera clicks)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,710858,715649,"- Wow. So I have no idea what this dish is,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,715650,719220,"what these various bouncy parts are,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,719220,721860,or what gives it that consistency.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,721860,726810,- So it's known as draw soup because of the viscosity of it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,726810,731760,It sits somewhere in between a soup and a stew.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,731760,732593,- Yeah.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,732593,736950,- It's made with ogbono seeds. It's like wild mango seeds.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,736950,738010,- Yeah.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,738010,738843,(upbeat music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,738843,741180,"- And the meat, I have chosen for you,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,741180,743670,is mixed meat.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,743670,747089,- It is the most unique consistency.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,747090,748860,- [Jamie] Yeah. - I have ever seen.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,748860,752070,"It's almost stringy like cheese,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,752070,756330,but part gelatinous bone marrow-y.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,756330,757740,- It's like slim.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,757740,759423,- [Ben] Possibly mucus like.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,759423,761511,- [Barry] (laughs loudly)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,761511,763829,"- I don't know I can't get, I dunno how to get it enough"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,763830,765810,on the spoon to be able to try it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,765810,766643,Cheers!
QYVyjS-Ky9E,767579,769889,- (chuckles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,769890,770723,- It's spicy.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,773202,775380,- [Barry] (laughs loudly)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,775380,776820,- That's a grower.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,776820,778920,"You know when you order for takeaway menu,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,778920,780000,it sometimes gives you a guidance
QYVyjS-Ky9E,780000,781293,of how many chilli next to it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,781293,782160,- (giggles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,782160,783329,- Which one did this have?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,783330,784163,Whoa.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,785430,787680,- A lot of Nigerian soups and stews
QYVyjS-Ky9E,787680,789830,are served with something called a swallow.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,790770,795210,And that is the solid part of the meal.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,795210,796290,I went for the pounded jams.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,796290,797880,This is a white yam.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,797880,800640,The brown skin of the raw yam is sliced off with a knife.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,800640,803100,The white inner part is boiled until soft.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,803100,805380,It's then pounded until it's smooth
QYVyjS-Ky9E,805380,807093,with a dough like consistency.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,808910,810209,- (giggles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,810210,812817,- Texture is unlike anything I've ever eaten before.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,812817,816180,"And I'm not great with the gelatinous textures,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,816180,817410,"but, hey."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,817410,819660,- It's a very traditional dish that every family
QYVyjS-Ky9E,819660,822660,in every tribe have a different recipe for making it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,822660,825569,Whether they prefer to have vegetables in it or not.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,825570,828240,"- And for that reason, I absolutely love it."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,828240,829830,- What amazes me about this
QYVyjS-Ky9E,829830,834720,is that all of these foods are available on our doorstep.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,834720,836699,- It's the very reason I love to travel the world
QYVyjS-Ky9E,836700,838050,is to try new dishes.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,838050,840630,The fact that you don't need to leave home
QYVyjS-Ky9E,840630,842460,and you can have dishes like this brought to you.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,842460,845220,- So it's from a restaurant called Enish Africa.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,845220,847050,They're on Old Kent Road.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,847050,848760,They do tonnes of Nigerian recipes
QYVyjS-Ky9E,848760,852150,as well as dishes from all over Africa.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,852150,856680,"- It's fiery, but more than just the spice, it is,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,856680,859350,so unlike anything we've ever had before.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,859350,861818,"And for that reason, I'm a big fan."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,861818,863100,(upbeat music)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,863100,866160,- Very strong start. You've done it again.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,866160,866993,- Whoa.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,866993,867826,- [Barry] My turn Ebbers.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,867826,869730,- Wipe the sweat from under my eyes
QYVyjS-Ky9E,869730,871293,- And please lift the cloche.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,872550,873383,- Ooh.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,873383,876839,- These are wheelcakes from Wheelcake Island.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,876840,878550,Who are based just in Spitalfields.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,878550,881040,They're aim was to recreate their Taiwanese childhood
QYVyjS-Ky9E,881040,883470,"favourite market store treats,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,883470,885329,and bring it to London.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,885330,888240,"So wheelcakes are soft, moist, fluffy,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,888240,890070,"Taiwanese pancakes,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,890070,892453,with creamy fillings in a variety of flavours.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,892453,893286,(camera clicking)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,893286,894270,You've got a bean paste there.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,894270,895800,We've got a chocolate and vanilla
QYVyjS-Ky9E,895800,897963,And you've got a cheese version as well.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,899130,902040,"- Sweet, but not sickly sweet."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,902040,904889,I remember having similar in Hiroshima.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,904890,906000,- The tricky thing with Ebbers here
QYVyjS-Ky9E,906000,907500,is he's done a lot of travelling.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,907500,908498,- He's done a lot.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,908498,911160,- He's not been to Nigeria and he's not been the Taiwan.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,911160,912336,So we're playing it safe.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,912336,914264,- All the Balkans.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,914264,915097,"- All the Balkans, different round."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,915097,917614,- Yum. I mean I'm still going 'cause they're all different.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,917614,918447,(knife clanking)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,918447,920670,"And in the spirit of originality and intriguing me,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,920670,922350,I am super intrigued.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,922350,924240,"Oh this is, this is by the different fillings"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,924240,925740,- [Barry] Chocolate and custard this one?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,925740,926797,- Oh that's the red bean.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,926797,927630,- Oh red bean.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,927630,929820,- Red bean paste is one of those that
QYVyjS-Ky9E,929820,932624,"on your first taste, you're like, oh, do I like that?"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,932624,933457,- Yeah.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,933457,935310,"And then on your second taste, you realise I do like it."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,935310,936356,- And then you can't stop.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,936356,937800,- And then you can't stop. No.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,937800,940440,"- For me, the texture of this one with the custard, yummy."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,940440,943050,"The flavour of the matcha, phenomenal."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,943050,946080,"And the red bean paste, I kind of I've always liked,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,946080,949173,"But, in an originality round,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,950670,953910,"we have had steamed doughs before,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,953910,955709,as steamed breads.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,955710,960710,And we have had kind of pancakes cooked in a similar vein
QYVyjS-Ky9E,961680,965339,but I've never had anything like that.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,965340,968880,"And although it wasn't my favourite thing I've eaten today,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,968880,970950,"under the category of originality,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,970950,972570,I love that we got to try it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,972570,973650,So my winner
QYVyjS-Ky9E,973650,977930,for the originality round is Nigerian stew and pounded yam.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,977930,978763,- (hand claps thumping)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,978763,979596,Well played. Well played.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,979596,982080,- Such an experience.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,982080,984510,- You got a great technique in these games.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,984510,985410,I've gotta learn-
QYVyjS-Ky9E,985410,986584,- What winning?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,986585,987418,"Yeah. - No, no!"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,987418,988251,- Yeah
QYVyjS-Ky9E,988251,991649,- Providing you didn't overspend on your £50 budget.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,991650,994290,Jamie will take the win two to one.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,994290,995699,Baz what did you spend?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,995700,997620,- £45.50.

QYVyjS-Ky9E,999600,1001699,- £49.51.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1001700,1002990,- Oh!
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1002990,1005000,"- Oh, You spent well too."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1005000,1006082,- 50 quid for lunch.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1006082,1007040,(chuckles)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1007040,1008750,- [Both] Hundreds hundred quid for lunch.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1008750,1009650,- You happy?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1009650,1010490,"- Told you I was hungry,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1010490,1013640,but granted a hundred pounds maybe little spend-y for lunch.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1013640,1014570,"But as always,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1014570,1016580,all the food will be shared with the rest of the team
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1016580,1018230,as soon as the cameras stop rolling.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1018230,1020839,- But for now it's over to you in the comments.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1020840,1021740,"Like me and Ben ,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1021740,1023813,do you agree that I had the best dishes?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1024709,1025543,Comment down below.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1025543,1027110,"Let us know, have you tried any of these?"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1027110,1029569,Which ones intrigued you the most?
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1029569,1030980,- Right? I'm in the seat next.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1030980,1031813,That's it.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1031813,1033939,My turn to have a hundred quid spent on me.
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1036124,1037069,(beep)
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1037069,1040100,"- We could also ordered a fufu, but I decided not to."
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1040100,1042919,"That's casa-va or cassava,"
QYVyjS-Ky9E,1042920,1044197,depending on how you want to pronounce it.
