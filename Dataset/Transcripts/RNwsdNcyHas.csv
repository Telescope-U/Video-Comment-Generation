RNwsdNcyHas,0,2080,you're racing against the clock someone
RNwsdNcyHas,2080,4160,is after you you need to defend yourself
RNwsdNcyHas,4160,5520,you scan the kitchen for anything that
RNwsdNcyHas,5520,7680,you can use to protect yourself a knife
RNwsdNcyHas,7680,9920,cliche frying pan what are you a disney
RNwsdNcyHas,9920,12799,princess then you see it yeah
RNwsdNcyHas,12799,16360,now you're talking
RNwsdNcyHas,25790,27760,[Music]
RNwsdNcyHas,27760,30800,hello internet welcome to food theory
RNwsdNcyHas,30800,33520,the show that's more spud than stud and
RNwsdNcyHas,33520,35760,welcome to minecraft weekend well we're
RNwsdNcyHas,35760,37200,over here talking about the deadly
RNwsdNcyHas,37200,39440,science of minecraft potatoes over on
RNwsdNcyHas,39440,40960,game theory we're delving into all of
RNwsdNcyHas,40960,43760,the wild wild editions in minecraft's
RNwsdNcyHas,43760,45680,latest update and talking all about the
RNwsdNcyHas,45680,47520,warden the skulk and the lore of the
RNwsdNcyHas,47520,50320,newly added music disc number five so be
RNwsdNcyHas,50320,51920,sure to check out that video after
RNwsdNcyHas,51920,53440,you're done with this one but before you
RNwsdNcyHas,53440,54879,hop over there you're probably wondering
RNwsdNcyHas,54879,56879,why i'm also talking about minecraft and
RNwsdNcyHas,56879,58960,specifically potatoes over here on food
RNwsdNcyHas,58960,60800,theory well for that i actually have to
RNwsdNcyHas,60800,62480,blame you you see i'm always on the
RNwsdNcyHas,62480,64000,lookout for your episode suggestions
RNwsdNcyHas,64000,66320,over on twitter at matpat gt if you're
RNwsdNcyHas,66320,67920,interested in submitting something and
RNwsdNcyHas,67920,69680,recently one request in particular
RNwsdNcyHas,69680,72240,caught my attention at x shadowcasterx
RNwsdNcyHas,72240,74320,reached out to me with this tweet quote
RNwsdNcyHas,74320,76240,i need to know if you could kill someone
RNwsdNcyHas,76240,78400,with a raw potato like what is the
RNwsdNcyHas,78400,80000,science of tommy and its death on the
RNwsdNcyHas,80000,82880,dream smp can someone actually die from
RNwsdNcyHas,82880,85280,blunt force trauma with a potato now at
RNwsdNcyHas,85280,86799,this point you're either reliving that
RNwsdNcyHas,86799,88400,moment because it lives rent-free in
RNwsdNcyHas,88400,90079,your head or you're wondering how i just
RNwsdNcyHas,90079,92240,accidentally misspelled dream simp and
RNwsdNcyHas,92240,94479,who the heck tommy knit is so let's just
RNwsdNcyHas,94479,95920,get all on the same page because whether
RNwsdNcyHas,95920,98000,or not you watch minecraft youtuber soap
RNwsdNcyHas,98000,99920,operas this is gonna be a nutritious
RNwsdNcyHas,99920,101600,theory that you're not gonna wanna miss
RNwsdNcyHas,101600,104159,the dream smp is a minecraft survival
RNwsdNcyHas,104159,106079,multiplayer server a special section of
RNwsdNcyHas,106079,107600,the internet just for playing survival
RNwsdNcyHas,107600,109119,games in minecraft that's been turned
RNwsdNcyHas,109119,111920,into a playground a performance stage
RNwsdNcyHas,111920,113280,for a group of friends to act out a
RNwsdNcyHas,113280,115119,story using structured improv think of
RNwsdNcyHas,115119,116399,this thing as a soap opera being
RNwsdNcyHas,116399,118320,performed live using minecraft
RNwsdNcyHas,118320,120079,characters and twitch streamers as the
RNwsdNcyHas,120079,122479,actors it is without exaggeration one of
RNwsdNcyHas,122479,123759,the biggest things to have happened in
RNwsdNcyHas,123759,125680,the gaming scene from the past two years
RNwsdNcyHas,125680,127040,and in that amount of time the story has
RNwsdNcyHas,127040,129039,produced dozens of iconic moments but
RNwsdNcyHas,129039,131039,few of them have had the level of drama
RNwsdNcyHas,131039,133599,and pure shock as tommy in its final
RNwsdNcyHas,133599,135120,death you know why i won't because i'm
RNwsdNcyHas,135120,137520,leaving this prison
RNwsdNcyHas,137520,139520,stop it stop it i'm on two hearts
RNwsdNcyHas,139520,142160,he's dead i've seen his grave his grave
RNwsdNcyHas,142160,144239,is real his corpse is that why don't you
RNwsdNcyHas,144239,146400,go see him no stop it
RNwsdNcyHas,146400,148480,that my friends is the stunned silence
RNwsdNcyHas,148480,149840,of a man who's just been clubbed to
RNwsdNcyHas,149840,152160,death by a raw potato not just any man
RNwsdNcyHas,152160,154080,either tommy was in many ways the main
RNwsdNcyHas,154080,156239,protagonist of the dream smp and a few
RNwsdNcyHas,156239,158080,swings of a potato the story suddenly
RNwsdNcyHas,158080,160000,lost its main character and what more
RNwsdNcyHas,160000,161760,glorious way to bid a due to this mortal
RNwsdNcyHas,161760,163280,coil than at the hands of a potato
RNwsdNcyHas,163280,165840,wielding madman and there he sat in the
RNwsdNcyHas,165840,168480,cold blackness of death from henceforth
RNwsdNcyHas,168480,169760,one stream later he'd be brought back to
RNwsdNcyHas,169760,171280,life thereby negating the three strikes
RNwsdNcyHas,171280,172480,your dead rule on the server and
RNwsdNcyHas,172480,173920,solidifying dream's abilities as a
RNwsdNcyHas,173920,175840,god-capable revival but still the potato
RNwsdNcyHas,175840,177680,death was a pretty big shock to any fans
RNwsdNcyHas,177680,179360,of this thing okay but enough talk about
RNwsdNcyHas,179360,181519,minecraft drama it's time to talk tuber
RNwsdNcyHas,181519,183519,this is the food channel after all we
RNwsdNcyHas,183519,185680,need to answer at x shadowcasterx's
RNwsdNcyHas,185680,187680,question could dream have actually done
RNwsdNcyHas,187680,189360,this is this just a classic case of
RNwsdNcyHas,189360,191760,video game logic going or could you
RNwsdNcyHas,191760,194080,actually kill someone with a potato
RNwsdNcyHas,194080,195760,clearly i'm going to be the first person
RNwsdNcyHas,195760,197360,to conduct a scientific investigation
RNwsdNcyHas,197360,199360,into the potential lethality of taters
RNwsdNcyHas,199360,201920,so wait what's this risk assessment of
RNwsdNcyHas,201920,204159,blunt ballistic impact trauma due to
RNwsdNcyHas,204159,207680,potato cannons huh okay so apparently
RNwsdNcyHas,207680,208959,i'm not the first person to
RNwsdNcyHas,208959,210640,scientifically investigate the risks of
RNwsdNcyHas,210640,212799,getting clobbered by a rogue spud sure
RNwsdNcyHas,212799,214239,the academic research paper is looking
RNwsdNcyHas,214239,215920,at potato guns but it's a good enough
RNwsdNcyHas,215920,217760,place to begin and a good reminder that
RNwsdNcyHas,217760,219760,anything can be lethal if it's moving
RNwsdNcyHas,219760,221840,fast enough however a high-speed
RNwsdNcyHas,221840,224000,projectile is a far cry from what we're
RNwsdNcyHas,224000,225440,actually talking about here dream's
RNwsdNcyHas,225440,227360,weapon of choice was a potato of the
RNwsdNcyHas,227360,229760,handheld variety less potato gun and
RNwsdNcyHas,229760,232239,more potato club potato club just sounds
RNwsdNcyHas,232239,234080,like a very carb-heavy sandwich to be
RNwsdNcyHas,234080,236000,honest obviously his potato club isn't
RNwsdNcyHas,236000,237439,gonna be striking with the same amount
RNwsdNcyHas,237439,239200,of speed and most of us intuitively
RNwsdNcyHas,239200,241120,understand that faster equals more
RNwsdNcyHas,241120,242879,dangerous a high speed highway crash is
RNwsdNcyHas,242879,244239,going to be a lot more deadly than a
RNwsdNcyHas,244239,246000,low-speed fender bender but it's
RNwsdNcyHas,246000,248400,important to understand why weapons like
RNwsdNcyHas,248400,249920,bullets are sometimes described as
RNwsdNcyHas,249920,252319,kinetic projectiles or kinetic energy
RNwsdNcyHas,252319,253920,weapons and that's largely because their
RNwsdNcyHas,253920,255760,deadliness comes from the kinetic energy
RNwsdNcyHas,255760,257919,that is the energy of motion if you paid
RNwsdNcyHas,257919,259280,attention in physics class you might
RNwsdNcyHas,259280,260880,remember that kinetic energy equals
RNwsdNcyHas,260880,263199,one-half mass times velocity squared
RNwsdNcyHas,263199,264639,that mass part shouldn't be all that
RNwsdNcyHas,264639,266320,surprising getting hit with a heavy
RNwsdNcyHas,266320,268000,thing hurts more than getting hit with a
RNwsdNcyHas,268000,269440,light thing double the mass double the
RNwsdNcyHas,269440,271680,kinetic energy obvious logic is obvious
RNwsdNcyHas,271680,273919,but the velocity squared part is what
RNwsdNcyHas,273919,275919,makes speed particularly deadly double
RNwsdNcyHas,275919,278160,the speed and you get four times the
RNwsdNcyHas,278160,280560,kinetic energy ten times the speed a
RNwsdNcyHas,280560,282639,hundred times the kinetic energy that's
RNwsdNcyHas,282639,284720,how a tiny bullet despite being a lot
RNwsdNcyHas,284720,286800,lighter than your fist or a potato can
RNwsdNcyHas,286800,289440,be that much more lethal it's traveling
RNwsdNcyHas,289440,291520,so fast so to understand how much
RNwsdNcyHas,291520,293199,kinetic energy tommy and its poor little
RNwsdNcyHas,293199,294720,noggins absorbing each time he gets
RNwsdNcyHas,294720,296240,bopped on the head we need to know the
RNwsdNcyHas,296240,298240,mass of the potato and how fast it's
RNwsdNcyHas,298240,299919,moving the current record holder for
RNwsdNcyHas,299919,302240,world's largest potato weighed in at 11
RNwsdNcyHas,302240,304400,pounds or 5 kilos but if you just go to
RNwsdNcyHas,304400,305759,your local grocery and pick out the
RNwsdNcyHas,305759,307039,biggest potato you can find it's going
RNwsdNcyHas,307039,309600,to be closer to around 1.75 pounds or
RNwsdNcyHas,309600,311840,0.8 kilos fun fact the us department of
RNwsdNcyHas,311840,313199,agriculture actually has official
RNwsdNcyHas,313199,314880,standards about the diameter and weight
RNwsdNcyHas,314880,316560,of what can be legally defined as a
RNwsdNcyHas,316560,318639,large potato medium potato or small
RNwsdNcyHas,318639,320160,potato because without those guard rails
RNwsdNcyHas,320160,321919,in place the starchy root vegetable
RNwsdNcyHas,321919,323440,economy would be completely out of
RNwsdNcyHas,323440,324880,control so the next time you hear
RNwsdNcyHas,324880,326479,someone dismissively refer to something
RNwsdNcyHas,326479,328080,as small potatoes you know that
RNwsdNcyHas,328080,329199,technically they're talking about
RNwsdNcyHas,329199,330639,something that weighs less than six
RNwsdNcyHas,330639,332240,ounces and is less than two and a half
RNwsdNcyHas,332240,333680,inches in diameter actually they're
RNwsdNcyHas,333680,335360,probably not using that precise of a
RNwsdNcyHas,335360,337039,definition because nobody actually knows
RNwsdNcyHas,337039,338720,about official food labeling guidelines
RNwsdNcyHas,338720,340800,but now you know thanks to me and thanks
RNwsdNcyHas,340800,342960,to the fine folks over at the usda who
RNwsdNcyHas,342960,344479,are responsible for coming up with those
RNwsdNcyHas,344479,346960,sorts of definitions anyway moving into
RNwsdNcyHas,346960,348960,other variables of our equation as for
RNwsdNcyHas,348960,350400,speed of the attack most professional
RNwsdNcyHas,350400,351919,boxers are able to punch with a speed of
RNwsdNcyHas,351919,354639,25 miles an hour or 11.2 meters per
RNwsdNcyHas,354639,356080,second though the best pros can reach
RNwsdNcyHas,356080,358800,speeds of over 30 miles an hour or 13.4
RNwsdNcyHas,358800,360880,meters per second the world's fastest
RNwsdNcyHas,360880,363360,punch hit at a speed of 45 miles an hour
RNwsdNcyHas,363360,365199,or 20 meters per second we do want to
RNwsdNcyHas,365199,366960,give dream his best shot at this but we
RNwsdNcyHas,366960,368639,also have to acknowledge that you know
RNwsdNcyHas,368639,371039,he's not a boxer not yet at least
RNwsdNcyHas,371039,373280,creator clash 2 is coming anyway let's
RNwsdNcyHas,373280,375520,go with the average of 25 miles per hour
RNwsdNcyHas,375520,377199,at least to start with plugging all of
RNwsdNcyHas,377199,378880,that into our kinetic energy formula
RNwsdNcyHas,378880,380880,using metric units like the civilized
RNwsdNcyHas,380880,384160,world 0.8 kilograms times 11.176 meters
RNwsdNcyHas,384160,386199,per second squared equals
RNwsdNcyHas,386199,389280,99.92 joules of kinetic energy meaning a
RNwsdNcyHas,389280,390960,top-tier boxer smack me in the face with
RNwsdNcyHas,390960,392479,a large potato would be delivering
RNwsdNcyHas,392479,394720,almost exactly 100 joules of kinetic
RNwsdNcyHas,394720,397039,energy which as usual when we calculate
RNwsdNcyHas,397039,398479,energy on these channels means
RNwsdNcyHas,398479,401680,absolutely nothing to anyone is it a lot
RNwsdNcyHas,401680,404639,it turns out uh maybe it's actually just
RNwsdNcyHas,404639,406400,a matter of probability the faster an
RNwsdNcyHas,406400,407840,object is moving when it hits you in the
RNwsdNcyHas,407840,409199,head the more likely it's going to kill
RNwsdNcyHas,409199,411360,you shock of all shocks according to a
RNwsdNcyHas,411360,413440,report titled lethality criteria for
RNwsdNcyHas,413440,415120,debris generated from accidental
RNwsdNcyHas,415120,417039,explosions the probability that getting
RNwsdNcyHas,417039,418800,hit with an object will be fatal is
RNwsdNcyHas,418800,420880,shown by this graph i know this looks
RNwsdNcyHas,420880,422960,suspiciously like 11th grade math which
RNwsdNcyHas,422960,424560,none of us really want to revisit but
RNwsdNcyHas,424560,426319,stick with me here the probability of a
RNwsdNcyHas,426319,427840,blow being fatal increases
RNwsdNcyHas,427840,430000,logarithmically this is also known as an
RNwsdNcyHas,430000,431759,s curve we don't need to know the ins
RNwsdNcyHas,431759,433440,and outs but one thing's plain to see
RNwsdNcyHas,433440,435120,that number smack dab in the middle
RNwsdNcyHas,435120,437680,there represents 100 joules a number
RNwsdNcyHas,437680,439440,that we just calculated for our pro
RNwsdNcyHas,439440,440960,potato punch getting hit with that much
RNwsdNcyHas,440960,443360,kinetic energy presents a 50 chance of
RNwsdNcyHas,443360,445759,fatality basically a coin flip as to
RNwsdNcyHas,445759,447440,whether mr potato is gonna be lethal
RNwsdNcyHas,447440,449440,when he collides with mr head that said
RNwsdNcyHas,449440,450960,we need to consider that in our dream
RNwsdNcyHas,450960,452960,smp scenario tommy and it is being hit
RNwsdNcyHas,452960,456160,repeatedly by dream each blow with a 50
RNwsdNcyHas,456160,457759,chance of fatality if each hit with a
RNwsdNcyHas,457759,459520,potato decreases tommy's health by half
RNwsdNcyHas,459520,460880,a heart and he starts the interaction
RNwsdNcyHas,460880,462400,with 10 hearts that means that he's
RNwsdNcyHas,462400,465360,being hit at least 20 times at 50 odds
RNwsdNcyHas,465360,467199,per hit the chance that number of blows
RNwsdNcyHas,467199,470800,is not fatal is a dismal zero zero zero
RNwsdNcyHas,470800,473520,zero nine percent practically zero
RNwsdNcyHas,473520,475520,probability of survival meaning that in
RNwsdNcyHas,475520,477440,this scenario the likelihood of death by
RNwsdNcyHas,477440,480080,youtuber tuber is assured but okay you
RNwsdNcyHas,480080,481599,say so much of this has to do with the
RNwsdNcyHas,481599,483199,power of the blow behind the potato a
RNwsdNcyHas,483199,485120,spud is only as powerful as the idiot
RNwsdNcyHas,485120,486879,deciding to use it as a blunt force
RNwsdNcyHas,486879,488879,weapon we calculated a modified pro
RNwsdNcyHas,488879,491120,boxer landing this punch but why would
RNwsdNcyHas,491120,493520,we assume that dream is a pro boxer by
RNwsdNcyHas,493520,495680,any standard well first off it's not
RNwsdNcyHas,495680,497199,that unreasonable to think that he would
RNwsdNcyHas,497199,498800,be strong it's confirmed that dream
RNwsdNcyHas,498800,500800,possesses special powers including
RNwsdNcyHas,500800,502400,raising people from the dead encoding
RNwsdNcyHas,502400,504720,the actual game i mean it is the dream
RNwsdNcyHas,504720,506479,smp after all for all we know he could
RNwsdNcyHas,506479,508400,be canonically way stronger than a pro
RNwsdNcyHas,508400,510240,boxer we also know that in the world of
RNwsdNcyHas,510240,511759,minecraft characters are able to carry
RNwsdNcyHas,511759,514399,like infinite amount of materials so you
RNwsdNcyHas,514399,516080,know there is some level of super
RNwsdNcyHas,516080,517839,strength here that said for the purpose
RNwsdNcyHas,517839,519200,of this kind of discussion and to make
RNwsdNcyHas,519200,520560,sure dream doesn't have an unfair
RNwsdNcyHas,520560,522240,advantage in calculations let's run
RNwsdNcyHas,522240,524080,another scenario assuming that he has no
RNwsdNcyHas,524080,526160,special strength or skills he's just a
RNwsdNcyHas,526160,528640,regular joe a regular steve more
RNwsdNcyHas,528640,530399,accurately who can throw a punch or
RNwsdNcyHas,530399,531760,wield a pickaxe but isn't going to be
RNwsdNcyHas,531760,533200,stepping into the ring with tyson
RNwsdNcyHas,533200,535839,anytime soon or jake paul what even is
RNwsdNcyHas,535839,537839,boxing anymore for this calculation
RNwsdNcyHas,537839,540080,we'll use a study of 16 amateur boxers
RNwsdNcyHas,540080,541600,that found that the typical punch ranged
RNwsdNcyHas,541600,544720,in speed from 6.7 meters a second to 9.5
RNwsdNcyHas,544720,547040,meters per second let's take the average
RNwsdNcyHas,547040,548880,of those numbers again nothing special
RNwsdNcyHas,548880,550399,there and assume that someone is trained
RNwsdNcyHas,550399,551760,enough with their potato punches that
RNwsdNcyHas,551760,553680,they can swing a spud with that speed
RNwsdNcyHas,553680,555200,run in the calculation again 0.8
RNwsdNcyHas,555200,557680,kilograms times 8.1 meters per second
RNwsdNcyHas,557680,560720,squared and you get 52 joules of kinetic
RNwsdNcyHas,560720,562240,energy going back to our graph we see
RNwsdNcyHas,562240,564240,that getting hit with an object with 52
RNwsdNcyHas,564240,567200,joules of energy gets us around a 10
RNwsdNcyHas,567200,569200,chance of lethality in other words it
RNwsdNcyHas,569200,571600,definitely can be fatal but it probably
RNwsdNcyHas,571600,573920,won't be provided of course it only
RNwsdNcyHas,573920,576480,happens once however remember dream is
RNwsdNcyHas,576480,578959,delivering a rapid flurry of at least 20
RNwsdNcyHas,578959,580880,potato strikes each landing with a
RNwsdNcyHas,580880,582880,velocity of an average punch it's only a
RNwsdNcyHas,582880,584959,matter of time before that 10 chance of
RNwsdNcyHas,584959,586880,death becomes an inevitability the
RNwsdNcyHas,586880,589040,probability of surviving all 20 hits
RNwsdNcyHas,589040,590720,that we see in this clip to bring tommy
RNwsdNcyHas,590720,594320,down from 10 full hearts to 0 is 12
RNwsdNcyHas,594320,596560,it's not nothing but odds are definitely
RNwsdNcyHas,596560,599040,not in your favor by sheer probability 1
RNwsdNcyHas,599040,601040,in every 10 punches kills you there are
RNwsdNcyHas,601040,602480,twice that number of punches happening
RNwsdNcyHas,602480,604320,here odds of killing you are now almost
RNwsdNcyHas,604320,605440,90
RNwsdNcyHas,605440,607040,those are the kind of odds that not even
RNwsdNcyHas,607040,609200,tom cruise could survive in top gun 2
RNwsdNcyHas,609200,610480,which honestly sounds like it should be
RNwsdNcyHas,610480,612800,an episode of film theory in conclusion
RNwsdNcyHas,612800,614640,that scene of dream smacking tommy ended
RNwsdNcyHas,614640,616320,up side the head over a dozen times and
RNwsdNcyHas,616320,618480,the tragic loss of our beloved brit by
RNwsdNcyHas,618480,620320,spud to the dome isn't just a case of
RNwsdNcyHas,620320,622160,video game logic in fact it's almost
RNwsdNcyHas,622160,624399,exactly how this sort of scenario would
RNwsdNcyHas,624399,626480,play out in real life i swear it's the
RNwsdNcyHas,626480,627760,episodes that i think are going to wind
RNwsdNcyHas,627760,629360,up the craziest that ultimately end up
RNwsdNcyHas,629360,630959,working out you end up cooking your
RNwsdNcyHas,630959,632800,steak in the dryer surprisingly i don't
RNwsdNcyHas,632800,635440,even know anymore but i do know that
RNwsdNcyHas,635440,636880,aside from the fact that tommy was
RNwsdNcyHas,636880,638880,immediately revived and dream broke all
RNwsdNcyHas,638880,640480,his canon rules seemingly for the sake
RNwsdNcyHas,640480,642720,of convenience this bud smackdown is a
RNwsdNcyHas,642720,645760,hundred percent supported by science but
RNwsdNcyHas,645760,647920,hey lunch and raw potatoes might restore
RNwsdNcyHas,647920,649200,your health and minecraft but they're
