exPkwc-TXv8,160,2159,last time we looked at tech companies
exPkwc-TXv8,2159,4560,that collabed with anime brands to make
exPkwc-TXv8,4560,6879,all kinds of special merch but today
exPkwc-TXv8,6879,9840,we're going deeper to find tech in anime
exPkwc-TXv8,9840,12820,that's actually real let's talk about it
exPkwc-TXv8,12820,14480,[Music]
exPkwc-TXv8,14480,16320,hello and welcome to denki channel my
exPkwc-TXv8,16320,18080,name is ken when it comes to works of
exPkwc-TXv8,18080,20880,fiction like anime writers and directors
exPkwc-TXv8,20880,23439,include aspects of mundane life in their
exPkwc-TXv8,23439,25680,storytelling so that viewers can better
exPkwc-TXv8,25680,27599,empathize with what's happening on
exPkwc-TXv8,27599,30160,screen take anime set in the current day
exPkwc-TXv8,30160,31840,it's hardly a surprise when we see
exPkwc-TXv8,31840,34880,characters say use a smartphone and post
exPkwc-TXv8,34880,37680,on twitter or instagram after all tech
exPkwc-TXv8,37680,40160,is that deeply woven into our culture
exPkwc-TXv8,40160,43040,these details can go a long way toward
exPkwc-TXv8,43040,45360,immersion even if it's granular in the
exPkwc-TXv8,45360,47600,scheme of world building and so here are
exPkwc-TXv8,47600,50079,some of my favorite moments when anime
exPkwc-TXv8,50079,52879,featured real life tech as spoiler free
exPkwc-TXv8,52879,55760,as i could possibly make it
exPkwc-TXv8,55760,58320,just like most forms of content anime
exPkwc-TXv8,58320,60800,isn't immune to product placement but in
exPkwc-TXv8,60800,63039,the scheme of a few hundred works
exPkwc-TXv8,63039,65600,released every single year it's not as
exPkwc-TXv8,65600,67439,common as you might think run your mind
exPkwc-TXv8,67439,70479,back to every time an anime featured a
exPkwc-TXv8,70479,72880,mcdonald's over a mcdonald's without
exPkwc-TXv8,72880,74880,getting in the weeds it makes a whole
exPkwc-TXv8,74880,77119,lot of sense when you consider that the
exPkwc-TXv8,77119,79920,rights to use brand names is generally a
exPkwc-TXv8,79920,82000,headache for everyone involved but on
exPkwc-TXv8,82000,84240,the rare occasion that product placement
exPkwc-TXv8,84240,86560,rears its head in an anime it certainly
exPkwc-TXv8,86560,88640,stands out someone that actually uses
exPkwc-TXv8,88640,90880,this as a tool in his arsenal is
exPkwc-TXv8,90880,93280,director makoto shinkai the creator
exPkwc-TXv8,93280,96560,behind the immensely popular 2016 movie
exPkwc-TXv8,96560,99360,kimi no nawa otherwise known as your
exPkwc-TXv8,99360,101360,name he's one of my favorite directors
exPkwc-TXv8,101360,103840,with how meticulous he is with his
exPkwc-TXv8,103840,106320,visual direction shinkai utilizes the
exPkwc-TXv8,106320,108479,hustle and bustle of tokyo as the
exPkwc-TXv8,108479,110880,backdrop for many of his films then
exPkwc-TXv8,110880,113360,takes visual effects and vivid lighting
exPkwc-TXv8,113360,115680,to amp up the look even further the end
exPkwc-TXv8,115680,118479,result is a tokyo that not only looks
exPkwc-TXv8,118479,121119,real for anime standards but is arguably
exPkwc-TXv8,121119,123360,better than real if your name was
exPkwc-TXv8,123360,125280,already one of the most beautiful
exPkwc-TXv8,125280,128000,immersive anime movies around its
exPkwc-TXv8,128000,130959,spiritual successor weathering with you
exPkwc-TXv8,130959,133599,upped the ante even more and one of the
exPkwc-TXv8,133599,136000,ways it did this was with brand and
exPkwc-TXv8,136000,137680,product placement to make his
exPkwc-TXv8,137680,139680,interpretation of tokyo way more
exPkwc-TXv8,139680,141520,believable i mean think about all of the
exPkwc-TXv8,141520,143440,advertisements and businesses that are
exPkwc-TXv8,143440,146000,in the city the film not only featured a
exPkwc-TXv8,146000,148720,very real mcdonald's with a very real
exPkwc-TXv8,148720,150800,big mac that looked better than any
exPkwc-TXv8,150800,152319,other big mac i've ever gotten
exPkwc-TXv8,152319,154560,weathering also featured brands like
exPkwc-TXv8,154560,157280,honda pepsi and for us
exPkwc-TXv8,157280,158640,apple
exPkwc-TXv8,158640,161519,peep the 12-inch macbook good choice an
exPkwc-TXv8,161519,162879,iphone
exPkwc-TXv8,162879,166080,and even airpods now shinkai said in an
exPkwc-TXv8,166080,168080,interview that he needed to go through
exPkwc-TXv8,168080,170160,hoops to get mcdonald's to give him the
exPkwc-TXv8,170160,172480,okay to use their image and likeness for
exPkwc-TXv8,172480,174959,the film but i have a feeling that
exPkwc-TXv8,174959,177120,working with apple to include them in
exPkwc-TXv8,177120,179519,the film was probably way easier to pull
exPkwc-TXv8,179519,181760,off than with the golden arches you see
exPkwc-TXv8,181760,184480,shinkai is publicly known to credit the
exPkwc-TXv8,184480,187360,mac as a primary tool for his work his
exPkwc-TXv8,187360,189840,early breakout hit voices of a distant
exPkwc-TXv8,189840,193040,star was written directed and produced
exPkwc-TXv8,193040,196720,basically by himself on a power mac g4
exPkwc-TXv8,196720,199280,back in the early 2000s and it seems
exPkwc-TXv8,199280,201680,like his loyalty toward apple hasn't
exPkwc-TXv8,201680,204319,gone unnoticed either with him and his
exPkwc-TXv8,204319,206400,works being featured in ads and
exPkwc-TXv8,206400,208480,promotional materials for the company in
exPkwc-TXv8,208480,211200,japan and it wasn't too long ago that he
exPkwc-TXv8,211200,213519,tweeted his praise over his new mac
exPkwc-TXv8,213519,215920,studio it's one thing to scatter brand
exPkwc-TXv8,215920,218400,names all over the screen but for
exPkwc-TXv8,218400,220959,shinkai i'd like to think that his apple
exPkwc-TXv8,220959,223040,placements were out of genuine
exPkwc-TXv8,223040,226159,admiration for the brand
exPkwc-TXv8,226159,228080,if you wear knitted shoes as much as i
exPkwc-TXv8,228080,230879,do you know how comfortable lightweight
exPkwc-TXv8,230879,232480,and breathable they are but step in a
exPkwc-TXv8,232480,234959,puddle by accident or walk in the rain
exPkwc-TXv8,234959,237439,for just a few minutes and my socks get
exPkwc-TXv8,237439,239760,soaked and my day is immediately ruined
exPkwc-TXv8,239760,241519,that's where the sponsor of today's
exPkwc-TXv8,241519,243920,video vessi comes in knit with
exPkwc-TXv8,243920,248080,sustainable 100 vegan dymatex material
exPkwc-TXv8,248080,250400,they have no right being this waterproof
exPkwc-TXv8,250400,252560,let's just put the shoe in got a big tub
exPkwc-TXv8,252560,254879,of water oh my god wow my toe is dry
exPkwc-TXv8,254879,257280,what socks completely dry how is it
exPkwc-TXv8,257280,259680,doing that their cityscape shoes in this
exPkwc-TXv8,259680,262000,charcoal gray colorway look really
exPkwc-TXv8,262000,264400,stylish while offering the comfort and
exPkwc-TXv8,264400,266880,durability a daily driver should i've
exPkwc-TXv8,266880,268960,been running errands with them going on
exPkwc-TXv8,268960,271919,walks best part vessi has lots of styles

exPkwc-TXv8,282000,284000,thanks to vesey for sponsoring what i do
exPkwc-TXv8,284000,286800,here on dinky channel
exPkwc-TXv8,286800,289520,the year 2011 gave us an epic and
exPkwc-TXv8,289520,292160,surprisingly dark spin on the magical
exPkwc-TXv8,292160,294320,girl genre called monica magika every
exPkwc-TXv8,294320,296639,couple of years or so nostalgia for my
exPkwc-TXv8,296639,298960,early fandom gets me re-watching it and
exPkwc-TXv8,298960,301680,the last time i did one scene caught my
exPkwc-TXv8,301680,303919,attention midway through the series one
exPkwc-TXv8,303919,306639,of the characters blue sayaka goes to
exPkwc-TXv8,306639,308479,visit her friend kiyosuke at the
exPkwc-TXv8,308479,310960,hospital the dude is a violinist that's
exPkwc-TXv8,310960,313440,run into health complications and so he
exPkwc-TXv8,313440,315919,can't play anymore hold up cause a cd
exPkwc-TXv8,315919,318080,player that's open my first thought was
exPkwc-TXv8,318080,321280,okay it probably just exists in the show
exPkwc-TXv8,321280,323199,but let's dig deeper out of curiosity
exPkwc-TXv8,323199,326160,keen-eyed redditors did some digging and
exPkwc-TXv8,326160,328560,found it to be real sort of the cd
exPkwc-TXv8,328560,330800,player turned out to be based on a
exPkwc-TXv8,330800,333199,concept from 2007 that never
exPkwc-TXv8,333199,335680,materialized into an actual product it's
exPkwc-TXv8,335680,337840,certainly of the time the designer made
exPkwc-TXv8,337840,341520,it as a hybrid cd slash mp3 player of
exPkwc-TXv8,341520,342880,course this was in the middle of the
exPkwc-TXv8,342880,345039,ipod days and people were still trying
exPkwc-TXv8,345039,346960,to figure out whether they wanted
exPkwc-TXv8,346960,348960,physical or digital and a lot of us
exPkwc-TXv8,348960,350560,ended up having both i would have loved
exPkwc-TXv8,350560,352960,to have one if not just for the novelty
exPkwc-TXv8,352960,355039,of the design but it's not to say that
exPkwc-TXv8,355039,358080,the concept is totally impossible while
exPkwc-TXv8,358080,360880,not exactly the same thing look back at
exPkwc-TXv8,360880,363360,the heyday of sony innovation in the
exPkwc-TXv8,363360,366400,late 80s it's a sunny and you'll find
exPkwc-TXv8,366400,368960,the discman d88 if you guys are
exPkwc-TXv8,368960,370800,genuinely curious about this product
exPkwc-TXv8,370800,373280,there's a really cool video on the tecmo
exPkwc-TXv8,373280,375840,channel doing a full breakdown but the
exPkwc-TXv8,375840,379199,d88 is genuinely a fascinating product
exPkwc-TXv8,379199,381520,absolutely impractical to play in public
exPkwc-TXv8,381520,383919,especially since cds scratch of you so
exPkwc-TXv8,383919,386319,much as look at them again this thing
exPkwc-TXv8,386319,388479,literally spins your discs out in the
exPkwc-TXv8,388479,391120,open but come on for the 80s this
exPkwc-TXv8,391120,394000,thing's pretty cool
exPkwc-TXv8,394000,396000,a bit of an obvious statement but the
exPkwc-TXv8,396000,398720,scope of technology doesn't just stop at
exPkwc-TXv8,398720,400720,the physical items you can hold with
exPkwc-TXv8,400720,403840,your hands devices are mere vehicles for
exPkwc-TXv8,403840,407680,software ecosystems ideas and concepts
exPkwc-TXv8,407680,410000,as you'll see with the next few examples
exPkwc-TXv8,410000,412639,abstract facets of technology can play
exPkwc-TXv8,412639,414960,to the environment an anime takes place
exPkwc-TXv8,414960,417680,in and can even affect its characters
exPkwc-TXv8,417680,419479,and stories while many of us are
exPkwc-TXv8,419479,422479,begrudgingly letting web 3 into our
exPkwc-TXv8,422479,425520,lives fame director mamaro hosoda used
exPkwc-TXv8,425520,427960,the metaverse as the backdrop for his
exPkwc-TXv8,427960,431440,2021 film belle which is best described
exPkwc-TXv8,431440,434080,as a modern day take on the classic
exPkwc-TXv8,434080,436240,beauty and the beast the way the film
exPkwc-TXv8,436240,438639,explores the concept of people living
exPkwc-TXv8,438639,440800,different lives in the virtual world
exPkwc-TXv8,440800,443919,through avatars is equal parts positive
exPkwc-TXv8,443919,446080,and negative it can break people out of
exPkwc-TXv8,446080,448400,their shell to become better versions of
exPkwc-TXv8,448400,451199,themselves
exPkwc-TXv8,451199,453199,but likewise if there's anything the
exPkwc-TXv8,453199,455039,internet has taught us already it's that
exPkwc-TXv8,455039,457599,anonymity can also give way to people
exPkwc-TXv8,457599,460800,being the absolute worst and in my
exPkwc-TXv8,460800,462400,opinion i think it does the whole
exPkwc-TXv8,462400,464160,metaverse thing pretty well at least
exPkwc-TXv8,464160,466160,considering that this is a film made for
exPkwc-TXv8,466160,468879,general audiences mama hosoda is all too
exPkwc-TXv8,468879,471120,familiar with making movies about
exPkwc-TXv8,471120,473759,bleeding edge tech apart from bell back
exPkwc-TXv8,473759,476720,in the year 2000 hosoda directed the
exPkwc-TXv8,476720,479840,digimon our war game film which featured
exPkwc-TXv8,479840,482160,hello real aspects of tech back in the
exPkwc-TXv8,482160,484240,day we're talking computers running
exPkwc-TXv8,484240,485840,windows 98
exPkwc-TXv8,485840,486960,email
exPkwc-TXv8,486960,490319,viruses but of course anime is truly the
exPkwc-TXv8,490319,492879,best when it's visual and active not
exPkwc-TXv8,492879,495440,just static shots of computer screens so
exPkwc-TXv8,495440,498560,hasoda used tunnels and 3d spaces to
exPkwc-TXv8,498560,500960,visually represent the internet in a
exPkwc-TXv8,500960,503280,space separate from the real world go
exPkwc-TXv8,503280,506160,figure for a movie based around digital
exPkwc-TXv8,506160,508720,monsters in a digital world but that
exPkwc-TXv8,508720,511199,digimon movie turned out to be a beta
exPkwc-TXv8,511199,514479,for what would be his 2009 film summer
exPkwc-TXv8,514479,516959,wars which is basically that digimon
exPkwc-TXv8,516959,519599,movie but with a standalone story and
exPkwc-TXv8,519599,522000,incorporates more online gaming and
exPkwc-TXv8,522000,524560,esports into its thematic makeup it's
exPkwc-TXv8,524560,526160,pretty safe to say if there's any
exPkwc-TXv8,526160,528320,significant advancement of tech in our
exPkwc-TXv8,528320,530480,lives and culture mamarosota will
exPkwc-TXv8,530480,532160,probably be there to make a film about
exPkwc-TXv8,532160,534320,it there are so many other interesting
exPkwc-TXv8,534320,536480,real tech references in anime that i
exPkwc-TXv8,536480,538480,want to cover but sadly this is all the
exPkwc-TXv8,538480,540320,time i got for this video if you liked
exPkwc-TXv8,540320,542000,it give me a thumbs up and let me know
exPkwc-TXv8,542000,544000,what other anime tech you'd like me to
exPkwc-TXv8,544000,546240,cover next thank you for getting denky
exPkwc-TXv8,546240,549760,channel to over 50 000 subscribers and
exPkwc-TXv8,549760,553600,otherwise i'll catch y'all later
