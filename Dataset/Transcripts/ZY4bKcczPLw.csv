ZY4bKcczPLw,6127,9094,Your mind has to seek discomfort.
ZY4bKcczPLw,9238,11841,It has to seek these difficult tasks
ZY4bKcczPLw,11866,12968,you have to enjoy it
ZY4bKcczPLw,13333,16063,and you have to figure out a way to make your mind enjoy those things.
ZY4bKcczPLw,16087,18393,Some people it comes easy and some people it doesn't.
ZY4bKcczPLw,18881,20312,Some people it takes a long time.
ZY4bKcczPLw,20833,24184,I always tell people the best thing you could ever do is force yourself to a schedule.
ZY4bKcczPLw,24208,25278,Just write it down.
ZY4bKcczPLw,25502,27994,Like today I have to do an hour on the treadmill
ZY4bKcczPLw,28065,31096,"I have to do an hour, no matter what even if you're walking."
ZY4bKcczPLw,31121,32787,You're doing an hour on the treadmill.
ZY4bKcczPLw,33001,34384,The next time you're going to do it
ZY4bKcczPLw,34408,37994,"just okay, you did an hour and this is the amount of miles you got in"
ZY4bKcczPLw,38090,40511,"next time you're gonna you know, add 3 miles."
ZY4bKcczPLw,40536,42918,Put- put an extra 3 miles in that one hour
ZY4bKcczPLw,43036,44679,and just keep doing things like that.
ZY4bKcczPLw,44704,46649,"Write down, today I’m going to do a 100 push-ups,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,46674,49079,I’m going to do 100 sit-ups and I’m going to do 100 chin-ups
ZY4bKcczPLw,49104,49966,that's today
ZY4bKcczPLw,49991,51237,and then force yourself.
ZY4bKcczPLw,51301,53482,Force yourself to adhere to a schedule.
ZY4bKcczPLw,53507,56094,"Make a Monday, Wednesday, Friday workout schedule"
ZY4bKcczPLw,56119,58135,"give yourself some time to- off, you know."
ZY4bKcczPLw,58160,61395,"Like don't, don't even crush yourself to the point where you can't do it."
ZY4bKcczPLw,61604,64239,Make it so that you really appreciate those Tuesdays and Thursdays
ZY4bKcczPLw,64470,67509,"but on Monday, Wednesday and Friday you're gonna get after it"
ZY4bKcczPLw,67534,68854,and this is what you're gonna do.
ZY4bKcczPLw,69042,70904,Most people just try to go work out
ZY4bKcczPLw,71026,73320,and you're kind of aimless and you show up
ZY4bKcczPLw,73345,75845,and like when you pick up the jump rope and you drop a little rope
ZY4bKcczPLw,75869,78662,"maybe you hit the heavy bag a little bit, maybe you do some curls"
ZY4bKcczPLw,78869,80330,but you don't really have an aim.
ZY4bKcczPLw,82266,85577,That's why people like to hire trainers because the trainer will tell you what to do.
ZY4bKcczPLw,85602,86602,"Well,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,86713,89047,you can tell yourself what to do
ZY4bKcczPLw,89269,92793,if you don't have money for a trainer you don't even have to have equipment
ZY4bKcczPLw,93090,97598,"you know, with bodyweight squats, sit-ups, chin-ups, push-ups"
ZY4bKcczPLw,97671,101393,you could give yourself a brutal full body weight workout.
ZY4bKcczPLw,102674,104793,And you could find these for free on YouTube
ZY4bKcczPLw,104818,105848,there's a ton of them.
ZY4bKcczPLw,105904,107895,There's a ton of these body weight workouts you could do.
ZY4bKcczPLw,107919,111062,"Just force yourself, write it down Monday, Wednesday and Friday"
ZY4bKcczPLw,111087,113864,"I’m going to do 100 push-ups, I’m going to do 100 chin-ups,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,113889,115198,I’m going to do 100 sit-ups.
ZY4bKcczPLw,115223,116783,Even if it takes me all day.
ZY4bKcczPLw,116874,120370,Even if I have to do 10 and 10 and 10 and keep going all day
ZY4bKcczPLw,120474,121496,just that's what you do
ZY4bKcczPLw,121521,124791,"10 push-ups, take a break for 20 minutes do another 10."
ZY4bKcczPLw,124871,126164,But get those 100 in.
ZY4bKcczPLw,126879,129004,I don't believe in half-doing things
ZY4bKcczPLw,129585,130756,This life is short
ZY4bKcczPLw,130886,132966,"you know, if you get into something, get into it"
ZY4bKcczPLw,132991,134791,and if you're not into it don't be into it.
ZY4bKcczPLw,134951,138166,And I think that insanity and- and greatness
ZY4bKcczPLw,138191,139431,are next-door neighbors
ZY4bKcczPLw,139540,141058,and they borrow each other's sugar
ZY4bKcczPLw,141083,144588,that's- that's my... that's what I’ve always said
ZY4bKcczPLw,144821,148398,"there's- there's something about mastery, like, true mastery"
ZY4bKcczPLw,148836,154071,that requires you to shut off massive areas of your life.
ZY4bKcczPLw,154680,158825,There's a lot of people that are scared of their ability to do something that's difficult
ZY4bKcczPLw,159553,162553,I don't know if I could force myself to be disciplined.
ZY4bKcczPLw,162578,165874,I don't know if I could force myself to take that kind of action.
ZY4bKcczPLw,165916,168300,"Well, if you do force yourself to take that kind of action"
ZY4bKcczPLw,168325,169877,you don't have that question anymore.
ZY4bKcczPLw,170071,171888,"That question, ""I don't know if I can do it"""
ZY4bKcczPLw,171913,172944,"Well, you're doing it."
ZY4bKcczPLw,172983,175303,"So you obviously can do it, can you do it tomorrow?"
ZY4bKcczPLw,175328,177260,"You did it today, why can't you do it tomorrow?"
ZY4bKcczPLw,177285,178285,Just do it.
ZY4bKcczPLw,178357,183058,You get so much more benefit out of a struggle that you choose to embark in
ZY4bKcczPLw,183276,185418,versus a struggle that life throws upon you.
ZY4bKcczPLw,186974,189266,Get out there and go do something
ZY4bKcczPLw,189291,190941,just go- just go
ZY4bKcczPLw,191116,193688,and then in the middle of doing it it'll become easy.
ZY4bKcczPLw,194373,196651,"Even if it's not easy, even if it's hard"
ZY4bKcczPLw,197582,201243,it's easier than not doing it and wishing that you had done it.
ZY4bKcczPLw,207559,211253,Oftentimes people confuse discipline with focus
ZY4bKcczPLw,211355,213577,"and this is what, why that's important."
ZY4bKcczPLw,213918,216141,There are things that...
ZY4bKcczPLw,216938,218922,some people can excel at
ZY4bKcczPLw,218985,220929,because they're focused on them
ZY4bKcczPLw,221009,224683,and because they're drawn to it and they have an incredible passion for it.
ZY4bKcczPLw,224822,227600,"Versus like, you tell a guy like, hey"
ZY4bKcczPLw,227727,229897,"you know, you're going to study to be an electrical engineer"
ZY4bKcczPLw,229921,231899,"and he's like, I don't want to be an electrical engineer."
ZY4bKcczPLw,231923,233203,"Well, you got to have discipline."
ZY4bKcczPLw,233233,235277,And so they don't have the drive
ZY4bKcczPLw,235407,237571,"and they don't, they don't get excited about it"
ZY4bKcczPLw,237596,239739,and they don't do it but if you tell that guy
ZY4bKcczPLw,240064,241504,whatever you're going to be a golfer
ZY4bKcczPLw,241588,243410,and he loves golf
ZY4bKcczPLw,243445,246675,and he's practicing every day and he becomes a professional golfer.
ZY4bKcczPLw,246819,249335,"You say well, I thought that guy didn't have any discipline."
ZY4bKcczPLw,249575,251543,"Well, it's not that he didn't have any discipline"
ZY4bKcczPLw,251568,253685,he's just not interested in that other thing.
ZY4bKcczPLw,254006,256298,I was never a disciplined kid
ZY4bKcczPLw,256704,257593,but I was...
ZY4bKcczPLw,257633,260600,I would find things that I loved and I was obsessed
ZY4bKcczPLw,260704,262427,and I always felt embarrassed by it
ZY4bKcczPLw,262636,265041,"because people would say, Oh, your son.. like to my mom"
ZY4bKcczPLw,265334,266731,your son is so disciplined
ZY4bKcczPLw,266803,268501,and she'd be like- My son is crazy.
ZY4bKcczPLw,268526,272898,"Like he's not disciplined, he finds these things and that's all he does all day long."
ZY4bKcczPLw,272966,274649,Like it's not really discipline
ZY4bKcczPLw,274760,276291,"because he doesn't clean his room,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,276316,277943,he's- he's lazy
ZY4bKcczPLw,277983,280754,there's all sorts of things he's supposed to do. I never did my homework.
ZY4bKcczPLw,280779,284151,There's all that.. But if I had a thing that I was into
ZY4bKcczPLw,284314,285957,- I was obsessed - You were crazy about it
ZY4bKcczPLw,285982,289247,but it would bother me that I didn't really have discipline.
ZY4bKcczPLw,289339,291315,Like if I had jobs that I had to do
ZY4bKcczPLw,291341,294324,"I didn't do a good job with them, like in the construction jobs that I had."
ZY4bKcczPLw,294724,297035,- But when it came to martial arts - How did you find those things though?
ZY4bKcczPLw,297059,298892,How did you find those things? You stumble upon them?
ZY4bKcczPLw,298916,301526,"I just got lucky, I just got lucky. Martial arts, I just got lucky."
ZY4bKcczPLw,301622,304614,And it clicked with me like almost immediately.
ZY4bKcczPLw,304639,306059,I became obsessed.
ZY4bKcczPLw,306155,308909,"You know, and I wanted to be.. I wanted to excel at it"
ZY4bKcczPLw,308934,310884,and so I was just doing it all day long.
ZY4bKcczPLw,313945,317191,And I think the more you choose to embark on these struggles
ZY4bKcczPLw,317216,320081,especially physical and mental struggles
ZY4bKcczPLw,320106,322883,"because I consider both martial arts, yoga"
ZY4bKcczPLw,323035,324741,and actually even trail running
ZY4bKcczPLw,324766,328074,I consider the mental struggles as much as physical struggles.
ZY4bKcczPLw,328150,329840,"Like, because I could stop anytime I want."
ZY4bKcczPLw,329865,332222,I'm halfway up the hill I can go screw this
ZY4bKcczPLw,332247,333842,- I’m walking the rest of the way. - Yeah
ZY4bKcczPLw,333867,336685,"I call my dog over, put him on the leash I’m like, we're walking, buddy. You know?"
ZY4bKcczPLw,337899,341176,"But or you could say, no, this is what I’m doing today"
ZY4bKcczPLw,341201,344518,I have a... I have a very clear plan in front of me
ZY4bKcczPLw,344618,347539,"my plan is, we're doing four miles today"
ZY4bKcczPLw,347610,350014,"this is where we start, this is where we end"
ZY4bKcczPLw,350040,351101,this is what we're doing.
ZY4bKcczPLw,351857,353785,Sometimes when things are really hard to do
ZY4bKcczPLw,353960,355968,"you think, oh, my god I gotta stop doing this"
ZY4bKcczPLw,355993,359776,but once you do it and you complete it you have a satisfaction.
ZY4bKcczPLw,359997,362814,"This sense of satisfaction that you did something really difficult,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,363005,364447,that is irreplaceable.
ZY4bKcczPLw,364634,368103,Some kids never get that and they just stay fat and stupid their whole life.
ZY4bKcczPLw,368273,370630,And some kids they get these little lessons
ZY4bKcczPLw,370796,373836,and then they realize like you can push yourself and you can get somewhere.
ZY4bKcczPLw,373861,377163,"You know, some kids get real lucky and they get involved in sports"
ZY4bKcczPLw,377760,378887,or martial arts early
ZY4bKcczPLw,378912,381728,and one of the best benefits of sports is you realize that
ZY4bKcczPLw,381754,383531,"through hard work you get improvement,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,383579,385048,"through improvement you get success,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,385073,387294,through success you get that big dopamine rush.
ZY4bKcczPLw,387326,388564,- You get that good feeling - Confidence
ZY4bKcczPLw,388588,389803,- You get confidence.  - Yeah
ZY4bKcczPLw,389828,391224,- You get this knowledge  - You get the girl
ZY4bKcczPLw,391249,393209,"Yeah, you get- sometimes- I didn't"
ZY4bKcczPLw,393293,396399,but you get this knowledge that you can do something
ZY4bKcczPLw,396745,397814,that's difficult
ZY4bKcczPLw,397839,400317,and you can overcome even though it feels like you can't.
ZY4bKcczPLw,400818,402341,You're gonna have days where you suck
ZY4bKcczPLw,402453,405096,but those days are so motivational.
ZY4bKcczPLw,405733,408003,I mean that's the bright side of tragedy.
ZY4bKcczPLw,408450,409728,So when you come through it
ZY4bKcczPLw,409753,413482,you really will have an appreciation for the moments without tragedy.
ZY4bKcczPLw,413915,416828,"You don't really feel it unless you- you get,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,416987,418431,unless life burns you.
ZY4bKcczPLw,418624,419735,You don't really feel it.
ZY4bKcczPLw,420140,422727,"It's one, one of the things that I tell people all the time"
ZY4bKcczPLw,422846,426343,because a lot of people have a hard time defining themselves.
ZY4bKcczPLw,426368,429346,They define themselves by failure because they failed
ZY4bKcczPLw,429386,432056,"but I’m like, you're not your failures, you're you."
ZY4bKcczPLw,432143,434897,"Okay, your life is a series of lessons you've learned."
ZY4bKcczPLw,434937,437270,"Now, if you just dwell on the failures"
ZY4bKcczPLw,437619,439832,"like that's not, that's not healthy."
ZY4bKcczPLw,439858,441841,It's not smart and it's not empowering.
ZY4bKcczPLw,442123,446218,"What you got to do is look at those failures you go, well, now you know what not to do"
ZY4bKcczPLw,446325,448420,"but you're not that, you're you."
ZY4bKcczPLw,448483,451284,"You know, you could have done the stupidest things ever"
ZY4bKcczPLw,451590,453518,"but it's not you, that's not you"
ZY4bKcczPLw,453544,454931,you're- you're a different thing.
ZY4bKcczPLw,455020,458638,You're the- the being that's experiencing all these failures
ZY4bKcczPLw,458793,461110,and if you know that they're mess-ups
ZY4bKcczPLw,461253,462547,then you've learned.
ZY4bKcczPLw,462872,465674,"Okay, if you repeat them over and over again"
ZY4bKcczPLw,465906,467146,"well, then I can't talk to you."
ZY4bKcczPLw,467223,470762,"You know, if you keep going back and doing the same stupid stuff over and over again"
ZY4bKcczPLw,471033,472500,"well, you got a deeper issue."
ZY4bKcczPLw,472549,475025,"You know, I don't know what it is but I don't have the time."
ZY4bKcczPLw,476321,478687,Building up that ability to endure things
ZY4bKcczPLw,478940,482065,that's also a very important mechanism
ZY4bKcczPLw,482186,483817,that you could apply to everyday life
ZY4bKcczPLw,483956,487409,like that- the mechanism of understanding how to endure
ZY4bKcczPLw,488199,490490,"like Jocko Willink, perfect example,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,490515,491956,"you know, he has that thing on his.."
ZY4bKcczPLw,492412,496371,"If you go to his Instagram page, almost every other photo is a watch"
ZY4bKcczPLw,496693,498883,and it's a watch that says 4:30 in the morning
ZY4bKcczPLw,498908,500834,because that's when he gets up and he works out
ZY4bKcczPLw,500918,502502,and he earns the sunset.
ZY4bKcczPLw,502656,505380,"And he does that, he's so disciplined"
ZY4bKcczPLw,505577,508466,and he's got this saying that's a great saying
ZY4bKcczPLw,508491,510275,"""Discipline equals freedom"""
ZY4bKcczPLw,510644,511653,and it's true
ZY4bKcczPLw,511678,515860,because he's able to force himself to do that every single time
ZY4bKcczPLw,515885,517767,there's no excuses.
ZY4bKcczPLw,517792,521187,"There's no breaks, there's no days off."
ZY4bKcczPLw,521253,522253,It doesn't happen
ZY4bKcczPLw,522435,525102,"so because of that, you're like, you're not scared"
ZY4bKcczPLw,525422,527494,you know that you can keep doing it
ZY4bKcczPLw,527519,529422,you know that you can continue to perform.
ZY4bKcczPLw,530052,532496,There's a lot of people just running from discomfort
ZY4bKcczPLw,532521,534701,"they're running from it, they're just avoiding it"
ZY4bKcczPLw,534726,535791,it's so easy to
ZY4bKcczPLw,535932,538170,and like if you get distracted for a second
ZY4bKcczPLw,538210,540290,"you're like, yeah, let me check my phone"
ZY4bKcczPLw,540369,542980,you just start going through your phone and looking at stuff
ZY4bKcczPLw,543083,548805,and you're just distracting yourself from the tiniest frustration of boredom
ZY4bKcczPLw,549070,550070,- Just a little- - Yeah
ZY4bKcczPLw,550340,551785,we don't get bored anymore
ZY4bKcczPLw,551935,552999,or if we get bored
ZY4bKcczPLw,553024,555745,we get bored for these tiny amounts of time then you get distracted.
ZY4bKcczPLw,555810,558516,So your distraction is eliminating
ZY4bKcczPLw,558849,560730,"your boredom but the problem with that is like,"
ZY4bKcczPLw,561064,563714,there's certain thoughts that only come to you
ZY4bKcczPLw,563778,564873,"when you're thinking,"
