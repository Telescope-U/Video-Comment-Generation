xbxtkPxEpIE,0,7200,top of the morning to you ladies my name  is jacksepticeye and welcome to fire  changing tides i did fire loan sales uh
xbxtkPxEpIE,7200,12400,a bit ago and i did the entire game in  one video and i had a ton of fun doing
xbxtkPxEpIE,12400,17840,that the game was awesome and a lot of  you reacted very positively to it and  the the video is very popular with
xbxtkPxEpIE,17840,24560,people so here i am finally with the  sequel it actually came out not long  after i did that last video but a lot of
xbxtkPxEpIE,24560,30160,stuff has been going on and i just kept  putting it off and off and off but i'm  finally ready to sit down and record
xbxtkPxEpIE,30160,35440,this all in one session and i'm very  excited about it i've heard some good  things about it people have said that
xbxtkPxEpIE,35440,42480,it's just as good as the first one if  not better um and this is weird because  we're starting underwater
xbxtkPxEpIE,42480,49039,the the last game was all about well if  you haven't watched the previous video i  highly suggest you do that pause this
xbxtkPxEpIE,49039,55680,one go watch that one then come back  watch this  it's like it's going to be like seven
xbxtkPxEpIE,55680,60719,hours of content but you'll be happy for  it  but the last game had
xbxtkPxEpIE,60719,66000,like an apocalyptic scenario where there  was like no water anywhere and it was  all kind of
xbxtkPxEpIE,66000,72479,everything was all desolate and deserty  and sandy and snowy and then the game  ended with us finding water and we got
xbxtkPxEpIE,72479,79040,saved by a ship now this one's starting  at water so are we starting like right  from where we ended
xbxtkPxEpIE,79040,87360,i have no idea but let's get in  well probably not because that's not me
xbxtkPxEpIE,87360,94560,unless have i changed  oh whoa that messed with my my sense of
xbxtkPxEpIE,94560,101840,depth  oh  that was weird  hey
xbxtkPxEpIE,102159,108560,so this one's about uh like a boat  kind of the last one was all about like
xbxtkPxEpIE,108560,115200,being on ground and i think this one is  about like sailing across the water  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,115200,120880,what if this is like a prequel actually  what if this is a prequel and my boat
xbxtkPxEpIE,120880,128720,that i get in this game is actually the  one that saves my guy from the last one  because my last guy was like a little  fireman he was all covered in red
xbxtkPxEpIE,128720,136800,and i like that it was cute but this is  this ain't me  also do i have infinite breath
xbxtkPxEpIE,137760,143400,i don't know kind of reminds me of  inside when i'm underwater like that
xbxtkPxEpIE,144080,150000,this actually feels like it's way before  the first game  maybe it leads into the events of the
xbxtkPxEpIE,150000,155200,first gear i don't know i'll stop trying  to guess one of those is correct
xbxtkPxEpIE,155200,162480,let's just check to the end of the video  and see that i was correct  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,162480,168560,beautiful music  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,168560,175519,nice  i feel like i have infinite breath
xbxtkPxEpIE,177200,182360,that or i can hold my breath like an  olympic swimmer
xbxtkPxEpIE,185840,194400,this is like the  started off in a tiny town or the other  one as well wait do am i supposed to  climb on this to get out the window
xbxtkPxEpIE,194400,199799,oh no there's a thing up there oh that's  hard to see
xbxtkPxEpIE,202400,210080,there we go i do use it to get out the  window haha  oh okay settle in everyone we're here
xbxtkPxEpIE,210080,215519,for a long journey we're here for uh  about three hours probably so get
xbxtkPxEpIE,215519,221610,yourself some snacks  or if you're not hungry yet  wait
xbxtkPxEpIE,221610,226550,[Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,228480,234239,hmm  well at least it's a bigger town than i  started in last time
xbxtkPxEpIE,237680,243359,i've also heard that the whoa this is  cool a little greenhouse kind of thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,243680,250580,i've also heard that the little ship you  get in this one is actually  harder to manage as well
xbxtkPxEpIE,250580,255840,[Music]  who that
xbxtkPxEpIE,257680,262880,i have a pot  watch out i have a plant  wait
xbxtkPxEpIE,262880,270929,i'm gonna wear the same clothes as you  are in that picture and i've got the  same plant  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,271040,277759,okay am i supposed to do something with  this plant  [Music]  and then i'll bring it with me anytime
xbxtkPxEpIE,277759,283040,you're going to give me something in the  game i'm going to take it as far as i  possibly can
xbxtkPxEpIE,283040,288240,i  oh my god i lost it already oh i'm a
xbxtkPxEpIE,288240,294240,terrible planned parent  oh this is why i don't have plants in my  house
xbxtkPxEpIE,294240,301840,also because bb will eat them and choke  on them and die but  my god
xbxtkPxEpIE,302240,307440,what's this  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,308639,314960,okay  interesting new mechanic  well not that new but
xbxtkPxEpIE,314960,320960,it's similar enough to the previous one  let's check underwater  in case we're missing anything
xbxtkPxEpIE,320960,326479,there's a whole section of earth  underwater that we're all missing all  the time granted not a whole lot happens
xbxtkPxEpIE,326479,334720,down there most of the time but it's  still pretty cool  uh this looks like like 1920s right like
xbxtkPxEpIE,334720,341840,the types of cars  industry is booming  there's that sort of aesthetic going  down
xbxtkPxEpIE,343440,350320,at least i think  i just associate that time period with  the 1920s i actually don't know  if it is the 1920s it could be the 50s
xbxtkPxEpIE,350320,357840,for all i know i think it's the 20s  that had like cars as a  surge right
xbxtkPxEpIE,361199,366280,because we saw a little bit of these  factories in the last game
xbxtkPxEpIE,366400,374000,and they made the giant walking  massive sort of boat that took a million
xbxtkPxEpIE,374000,379319,fuel  how do i hit that
xbxtkPxEpIE,381919,388479,huh  okay this is clearly important i'm  supposed you're supposed to jump off and  fall down and then learn the mechanics
xbxtkPxEpIE,388479,395840,of the game i know what i'm doing  i'm smart  it falls and dies
xbxtkPxEpIE,396639,401520,yeah there it is that's the kind of boat  thing that i get
xbxtkPxEpIE,405360,410960,okay i gotta  stick something in that  or is this a button
xbxtkPxEpIE,410960,413120,no
xbxtkPxEpIE,417840,422280,oh maybe i stick myself in that
xbxtkPxEpIE,423199,429120,oh  what is this
xbxtkPxEpIE,429280,436360,oh  suck the juice get rid of the soup
xbxtkPxEpIE,436960,441280,am i supposed to suck all of that out  yeah
xbxtkPxEpIE,442479,448160,cool  oh that means that my ship can take on  water i can probably crash and fill my
xbxtkPxEpIE,448160,453759,ship full of waters i have to suck it  out  oh no  it's the opposite problem i had last
xbxtkPxEpIE,453759,457919,time last time all i had to do was worry  about fire
xbxtkPxEpIE,461199,467280,whoa  what is that
xbxtkPxEpIE,468400,474479,well you ain't getting that off so  it's probably going to weigh you down
xbxtkPxEpIE,474479,479759,and drown you  ah you'll be fine
xbxtkPxEpIE,479759,484960,ah it opens up doors oh god oh god
xbxtkPxEpIE,485360,489280,okay can i suck the water out again
xbxtkPxEpIE,490720,496560,there's no way there's no way i'm able  to suck out  all of this water oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,496560,503680,it gives me a little helmet and a  propeller  whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,503680,508960,that's cool  i can go speedy whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,508960,515518,that's how i get up there  i understand it now  maybe
xbxtkPxEpIE,519518,524959,i don't understand a damn thing  i thought i could like launch myself out  of the water maybe i just have to get
xbxtkPxEpIE,524959,531759,close enough  that it unlocks  it signifies that i want in
xbxtkPxEpIE,533120,539519,it's a good sign that i'm overthinking  things this early it means that we're  going to be in for a rough ride
xbxtkPxEpIE,540320,546320,yay  boat  i see it  am i missing anything down here okay now
xbxtkPxEpIE,546320,552560,i definitely can infinitely breathe  right  with this little helmet
xbxtkPxEpIE,552560,555120,something here
xbxtkPxEpIE,557680,565680,clearly very important yep i needed that  of course  you gotta look below before you go above
xbxtkPxEpIE,565680,572160,man  i no  i know what i just said but that's not
xbxtkPxEpIE,572160,578160,what i meant  just bring this over here so we can jump  up  i was hoping that there's going to be a
xbxtkPxEpIE,578160,582000,mechanic that i could like shoot out of  the water
xbxtkPxEpIE,583360,590800,oh winds howling  nice let me in
xbxtkPxEpIE,590800,597680,okay i can't go there yet  hello ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,597920,603160,what do i do  you look important
xbxtkPxEpIE,607120,614240,okay that started the engine  am i stuck
xbxtkPxEpIE,620480,627360,nice  what a beauty  so much better looking than my last one
xbxtkPxEpIE,627360,633720,so much more sleek so much more stylish  a good iteration upon greatness
xbxtkPxEpIE,634399,638240,okay up goes this hail
xbxtkPxEpIE,641040,647000,what  or not  what is this
xbxtkPxEpIE,647000,652399,[Music]  ah
xbxtkPxEpIE,652399,658760,i have to attach it there  cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,660320,666959,is this a  is this moving the sail  i cut me some slack guys i'm gonna have  to learn all of this
xbxtkPxEpIE,666959,674360,as i'm playing  just like last time oh the little swirls  coming out of that is cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,675110,681600,[Music]  you can really open her up
xbxtkPxEpIE,682560,687160,i'm so confused as to how that works
xbxtkPxEpIE,688959,695760,is that good there  pushing it all the way forward does not
xbxtkPxEpIE,695760,701600,seem good  let's just stick her out here and catch  some air  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,701600,707199,didn't like a second fl ah there we go a  second flap
xbxtkPxEpIE,707839,712720,ah okay  wow  hey
xbxtkPxEpIE,714959,721040,why did you go back in i i don't i don't  know how this works
xbxtkPxEpIE,722350,728560,[Music]  i'll just leave it alone there we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,729519,736000,wow looks like the pacific northwest  all the trees in the mountains
xbxtkPxEpIE,736000,742399,set sail  onward my beauty  where are we going
xbxtkPxEpIE,742399,748000,i have no idea  but i'm happy to be out in the open  ocean in a thing that looks like it
xbxtkPxEpIE,748000,753760,should not float  oh man am i able to like submerge it
xbxtkPxEpIE,753760,758959,later i'm able to like submarine it down  underwater and go along the bottom
xbxtkPxEpIE,758959,765360,because there has to be an engine  component as well right  the first game had the sail but also had
xbxtkPxEpIE,765360,772279,the  the engine to work on as well
xbxtkPxEpIE,772560,779920,the world is still a mess cool good to  know  something's going to happen here i need  to be ready
xbxtkPxEpIE,782639,788079,so peaceful so far  i'm just a titan of industry
xbxtkPxEpIE,788079,793519,oh oh oh  oh  grab it
xbxtkPxEpIE,793839,800519,i forgot that oh  it's sticking off to the side
xbxtkPxEpIE,801920,806720,i'm just a little 2d man i work in two  planes
xbxtkPxEpIE,807440,815360,nice  not that zoomed out though oh god are we  coming up to a bridge yep yep oh take
xbxtkPxEpIE,815360,820160,her down take her down take her down oh  god
xbxtkPxEpIE,820639,829160,ow  oh it would have been faster to just  release the hook right
xbxtkPxEpIE,829279,834079,oh that would that makes sense actually
xbxtkPxEpIE,835040,843639,it's okay we're just a little banged up  i'll figure this out  can i can i put it up again
xbxtkPxEpIE,844880,851680,is it okay  that's weird whenever i push the button  in i feel like it's not locked in place
xbxtkPxEpIE,851680,859279,i try to figure out if i can go below  deck as well and heal my items but i  don't know if i have that stuff yet
xbxtkPxEpIE,860160,868600,okay nice  my sails look like garbage
xbxtkPxEpIE,870560,876880,okay cool so i can just kind of  i'll get more efficient at it as we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,877440,884240,also the last game had you like pick up  items along the way i had to pick up  stuff to constantly fuel my engines
xbxtkPxEpIE,884240,890320,i wonder if that's even a thing anymore  curious
xbxtkPxEpIE,890320,895839,because there has to be something for me  to do as all of this is happening  i can't just be sitting here looking at
xbxtkPxEpIE,895839,900800,the scenery  why did you just go back in suddenly
xbxtkPxEpIE,902399,907959,i don't understand it i don't know  what's going on half the time
xbxtkPxEpIE,914079,919760,did they get pulled forward maybe  oh christ
xbxtkPxEpIE,919920,926320,ow  my bad okay good to know that i can just  grab this and then everything goes up
xbxtkPxEpIE,926320,932720,okay cool can i get into my  bloody thing yet  no
xbxtkPxEpIE,934880,940320,all right  uh we've struck land land hole
xbxtkPxEpIE,940320,945839,wait a minute  what does what was that thing that i
xbxtkPxEpIE,945839,951519,stood on  it's like a button i pressed here i  wonder if that's like a
xbxtkPxEpIE,951519,956240,drop the sail button or something we're  gonna have to do some experiments
xbxtkPxEpIE,957279,962399,okay the front of her looks good  she got a little ding but she got a
xbxtkPxEpIE,962399,965639,little nosy
xbxtkPxEpIE,968160,972399,okay we're in a sawmill of sorts
xbxtkPxEpIE,974399,979639,all right  just start flicking switches
xbxtkPxEpIE,982240,987920,why do i break everything i love  why am i such a failure
xbxtkPxEpIE,991279,996880,okay  that puts that there got it and then i
xbxtkPxEpIE,996880,1004560,put a log on this right  i don't know hit buttons
xbxtkPxEpIE,1008880,1012240,nice we got ourselves a log
xbxtkPxEpIE,1014639,1020079,i  don't know why that's relevant  i have no idea what i'm supposed to use
xbxtkPxEpIE,1020079,1026880,it for  but i'm happy it's here
xbxtkPxEpIE,1028720,1035600,uh hello  oh it's just to get up there  okay i got a thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,1035600,1042000,look at my thing everybody stare at my  thing  look at my thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,1042079,1047918,also isn't that something i said last  time that it would be nice to like zoom  out or  zoom in or something i said it was nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,1047918,1054559,to zoom some direction  and now i  can ah
xbxtkPxEpIE,1054799,1062080,fixed it  i gotta bring that with me  okay you go over here
xbxtkPxEpIE,1065280,1070320,okay it just works now  like it didn't work before but now it
xbxtkPxEpIE,1070320,1075519,just suddenly works cool  that's awesome
xbxtkPxEpIE,1077840,1085520,can i fix my things with this oh  i thought i was dead
xbxtkPxEpIE,1086559,1094760,yeah  and my sails are back oh oh put it put  take it down take it down
xbxtkPxEpIE,1095520,1101200,okay  we're getting the swing of things now
xbxtkPxEpIE,1101200,1108080,look at me go  i'm a little dude on a mission
xbxtkPxEpIE,1108080,1115120,with no emissions  this is what the future is going to be  global warming is going to come devour
xbxtkPxEpIE,1115120,1120840,us all the world's going to fill with  even more water and then we're all just  going to live on sailboats like
xbxtkPxEpIE,1120840,1126559,this and then we can have like robot  wars where we all go out to the ocean we  all like crash into each other and
xbxtkPxEpIE,1126559,1132320,figure out who's the dominant force in  the land  spoiler i'm going to be up top
xbxtkPxEpIE,1132320,1138559,not at the very tippy top  i don't feel like a youtuber should be  um i don't think we're prepared to lead
xbxtkPxEpIE,1138559,1143600,society but i'll at least be up there  somewhere
xbxtkPxEpIE,1145600,1152559,okay now i actually have a lot of things  going on in my my little boat that i'm  confused about so we'll put that over
xbxtkPxEpIE,1152559,1158720,there  is it just like a specific point that i  put this out that
xbxtkPxEpIE,1158720,1166559,the other sail kicks in  because now it's not doing it or is it  if enough air is happening like
xbxtkPxEpIE,1169440,1176120,i don't get it  maybe it was this button
xbxtkPxEpIE,1178559,1186720,how do we get sail back  this is very confusing
xbxtkPxEpIE,1191440,1197679,yeah stay stay somewhere like there  right  well it gives me like a signifier when
xbxtkPxEpIE,1197679,1203120,it's catching a lot of air i think  or not
xbxtkPxEpIE,1203440,1209280,spending so much time trying to figure  this out that i'm not appreciating the  beautiful scenery
xbxtkPxEpIE,1210000,1212799,there that's good
xbxtkPxEpIE,1216320,1221840,lovely music  is there anything else i need to fix
xbxtkPxEpIE,1223120,1226799,i i can fix it jim will fix it
xbxtkPxEpIE,1228240,1232000,is it just when more air kicks in
xbxtkPxEpIE,1233520,1239840,because i'm very unsure  hello dear
xbxtkPxEpIE,1239840,1243440,oh look at those clouds
xbxtkPxEpIE,1247600,1255700,this is gorgeous i love the color  palette that they use in this game and  things kind of look like they have a  paintbrush sort of look to them
xbxtkPxEpIE,1255700,1263799,[Music]  oh there's a whole family of them
xbxtkPxEpIE,1264240,1272240,definitely the pacific northwest  or somewhere up near like colorado or
xbxtkPxEpIE,1272720,1278080,portland  now portland doesn't look like this does  it
xbxtkPxEpIE,1279600,1285440,portland has a lot of those types of  trees and seattle right  i've never really been outside the
xbxtkPxEpIE,1285440,1291440,cities i went to seattle a lot for  pax west when i would go to conventions
xbxtkPxEpIE,1291440,1296559,a lot and  for portland i've only been there once  for my tour
xbxtkPxEpIE,1296559,1302320,lovely city but they reminded me a lot  of each other  seattle city
xbxtkPxEpIE,1302320,1308320,maybe a bit more dense and like bigger  buildings i don't know  [Music]  i have so much wind why does the sail go
xbxtkPxEpIE,1308320,1314000,away guys  figure it out for me
xbxtkPxEpIE,1317520,1322799,i also love that these games don't start  with like a mission statement and it's  down again
xbxtkPxEpIE,1322799,1328000,it's just like hey here's your thing go  get your boat go
xbxtkPxEpIE,1328000,1333440,every other game has you going left to  right you don't need a reason in this  one go
xbxtkPxEpIE,1333440,1338799,except for the fact that the town i was  in everyone was dead and missing so  that's as good a reason as annie find a
xbxtkPxEpIE,1338799,1345039,different town find your other family  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,1345039,1350080,but i do wonder if it is like a  a climate crisis thing that's happening
xbxtkPxEpIE,1350080,1357279,in this game  okay let me let me pull these off for a  sec
xbxtkPxEpIE,1358400,1364000,maybe no that's not the right thing  that's not the right way of dealing with  this i need to pull them back so we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,1364000,1370679,slower  but i'm worried that i'm just gonna  smack into
xbxtkPxEpIE,1371270,1376799,[Music]  or even with the sale like this though  you still go
xbxtkPxEpIE,1376799,1380880,forward  okay that's good to know
xbxtkPxEpIE,1382320,1389399,it's like when you play sea of thieves  and you're like put down your sail put  up your sail i don't know how fast are  we going
xbxtkPxEpIE,1390670,1396000,[Music]  although maybe it was good that i did  pull back the sail because it seemed
xbxtkPxEpIE,1396000,1404320,like  yeah i'm not pushing this now and it's  like  it's like moving along with the wind
xbxtkPxEpIE,1406960,1411360,that's so cool makes me feel like we're  going so fast
xbxtkPxEpIE,1413510,1420000,[Music]  anything noteworthy in the background  that i might have missed
xbxtkPxEpIE,1420880,1426799,seeing a lot of windmill things and that  kind of looks like the front of my ship  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,1426799,1434320,like the the front  here  like these little blade things
xbxtkPxEpIE,1434320,1440559,oh i can stand here and look way further  ahead  that's what that windmill in the  background kind of reminds me of
xbxtkPxEpIE,1440559,1447200,maybe that's how this is made because  it's all like decommissioned parts so  maybe they just  took bits off like a grain silo and the
xbxtkPxEpIE,1447200,1455679,windmill and just kind of like built  this  because i feel like this is going to be  a propeller to get us through the water
xbxtkPxEpIE,1456720,1461760,okay i'll stay here for a  bit longer i want to see if i'm going to  crash into anything but then i'm worried
xbxtkPxEpIE,1461760,1465120,that i don't have enough time to get  back
xbxtkPxEpIE,1469600,1475360,oh  whoa everything's vibrating and rumbling  what's happening
xbxtkPxEpIE,1475360,1477679,whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,1481600,1487840,what was that  the whole ground show is that an  earthquake
xbxtkPxEpIE,1491520,1496559,oh something's going on  there's a mysteries to be solved in this
xbxtkPxEpIE,1496559,1499559,one
xbxtkPxEpIE,1503200,1509120,because in my mind when i see this stuff  all i can think is that  like oh god
xbxtkPxEpIE,1509120,1514400,is that maybe global warming stuff  happened  oh no no
xbxtkPxEpIE,1514400,1519039,no  no god god ow
xbxtkPxEpIE,1519520,1525600,maybe global warming stuff happened and  the  the water kind of
xbxtkPxEpIE,1525600,1532880,surged onto the land i could be wrong  oh it's so cam now without the wind
xbxtkPxEpIE,1532880,1540400,where are we going to it's just a train  station  completely submerged
xbxtkPxEpIE,1541120,1547440,thank god you keep drifting because  otherwise i don't really have a way of  moving forward
xbxtkPxEpIE,1547440,1552720,not yet at least  i have to be able to get into
xbxtkPxEpIE,1552720,1557840,the middle of my boat thing right i  can't just
xbxtkPxEpIE,1558000,1564400,be doing it all from up here  what is that rumbling
xbxtkPxEpIE,1568880,1574320,hee i see your underbelly  tickle tickle and there's a way out down
xbxtkPxEpIE,1574320,1581480,there as well i'm assuming that's like  the submarine part of it whenever i need  it
xbxtkPxEpIE,1584400,1586960,so fun
xbxtkPxEpIE,1590880,1596240,you guys hear that right  you might not hear it if you don't have  good headphones or speakers
xbxtkPxEpIE,1596240,1602480,but there's like a boom  happening yes here we go fuel
xbxtkPxEpIE,1604240,1612120,wait fuel goes in  this  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,1613919,1618158,okay  this is like my old ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,1620080,1627840,oh  i have to work the bellows  i also got an achievement called fireman
xbxtkPxEpIE,1630080,1636240,wait  i i can't  i can't go to yemen i'm an analyst
xbxtkPxEpIE,1636240,1641840,i can't  use this one this is not my ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,1642320,1649520,what are you even talking about  what are you talking about  um
xbxtkPxEpIE,1649679,1655158,whoa  someone was doing some research
xbxtkPxEpIE,1656960,1665039,are these all things i can burn  hey if i can pick them up i'll i'll take  anything that's not nailed down
xbxtkPxEpIE,1665840,1669840,ah  okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,1671039,1676480,and uh  on you go
xbxtkPxEpIE,1679279,1684880,yeah i can't really  deduce where that is or oh i forgot i  can zoom i can't like deduce where that
xbxtkPxEpIE,1684880,1689760,is or what they're doing or where  they're going or anything like that
xbxtkPxEpIE,1690320,1695600,is that the path i just took  i don't know there's latitude and
xbxtkPxEpIE,1695600,1700480,longitude as well  away you go
xbxtkPxEpIE,1702559,1706320,wait where does that oh it drops in  right there
xbxtkPxEpIE,1708480,1715679,nice very helpful thank you  let's put some of you bad boys in shall  we
xbxtkPxEpIE,1715919,1721440,oh that's a lot  this is very much like the first game
xbxtkPxEpIE,1721440,1725840,now  okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,1728000,1733679,okay  i need to actually
xbxtkPxEpIE,1733679,1737640,fan the flames of industry
xbxtkPxEpIE,1738880,1745279,there you go  this is very complex
xbxtkPxEpIE,1745279,1749840,okay we don't want to overheat we don't  want to burn the whole thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,1752320,1758159,what about my boat  hello i can't just leave that behind
xbxtkPxEpIE,1758159,1766039,oh  ah  ow
xbxtkPxEpIE,1766080,1773600,you got some stuff on you oh my god  there is so much happening that i need  to take in what do you do
xbxtkPxEpIE,1774880,1780679,okay you're trying to open  dude
xbxtkPxEpIE,1785520,1791360,all right so how do i  move things and not move things
xbxtkPxEpIE,1793360,1799039,let's uh let's explore a bit further  down  because this can't move because that  stuff is on it but i can't grab that
xbxtkPxEpIE,1799039,1804559,movement  i'm just a tiny boy
xbxtkPxEpIE,1805279,1810320,what do you want from me  you can't do any of that
xbxtkPxEpIE,1814880,1822880,what if i ram it again  although oh i can pull it back we're  attached now
xbxtkPxEpIE,1822880,1829679,two pieces of one giant pod  wait but i can't move forward with it
xbxtkPxEpIE,1831279,1837320,why not  i want to move forward with it
xbxtkPxEpIE,1843919,1851840,i i don't know why i'm bringing you all  the way back  i don't think that that's gonna help  anything
xbxtkPxEpIE,1854000,1860799,was back at square one and i didn't do  anything  okay  my my best guess now is that i just have
xbxtkPxEpIE,1860799,1865799,to  put this thing full welly
xbxtkPxEpIE,1866159,1873519,oh we can actually go back  oh hold on a minute
xbxtkPxEpIE,1873519,1880080,wait a  minute unless all of this attaches to my
xbxtkPxEpIE,1880080,1886799,boat  that's that's too much  i can't handle that level of like
xbxtkPxEpIE,1886799,1891919,industry  i can't handle this level of complexity
xbxtkPxEpIE,1891919,1896799,my brain just goes one speed and that  one speed is slow
xbxtkPxEpIE,1899760,1906480,but it's interesting to see what's back  here  yeah let's make it go a bit faster
xbxtkPxEpIE,1906480,1911679,it's interesting that you have to like  work bellows like that  i'm probably just going to
xbxtkPxEpIE,1911679,1915278,hit the end of this and go nowhere
xbxtkPxEpIE,1918559,1925679,that's the power of the train  baby  it's coming for you
xbxtkPxEpIE,1927039,1935240,okay  let's see where we ended up  oh there's just more stuff back here
xbxtkPxEpIE,1935840,1941919,that's handy actually oh i put it on my  back  put this one on your back
xbxtkPxEpIE,1943600,1947480,all right it's good to have more fuel
xbxtkPxEpIE,1949840,1955840,i can't like jump over that can i  what  no
xbxtkPxEpIE,1955840,1963279,my tiny little man body won't let me  can i go up here okay i should explore
xbxtkPxEpIE,1963279,1969120,everything you know  make sure i'm not missing anything
xbxtkPxEpIE,1969120,1975200,okay let's go forward again  who knows maybe i can go fast enough  that now we'll crash off the edge of
xbxtkPxEpIE,1975200,1978880,something this other direction
xbxtkPxEpIE,1981440,1985760,i  can't go forward
xbxtkPxEpIE,1988240,1992080,yeah that's cool i didn't want you  anyway oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,1993360,2001200,oh  i figured it out now by accident  what is that
xbxtkPxEpIE,2001760,2005840,is that all i needed all of this for
xbxtkPxEpIE,2012799,2018000,oh  power  chicka
xbxtkPxEpIE,2018000,2026398,oh there it is  hardcore and i guess that this was  teaching me how to do it
xbxtkPxEpIE,2028159,2036000,yeah  so it's a bellow system and that was  just showing me  the way forward wow
xbxtkPxEpIE,2036000,2041200,it's got rowings  it's got rowy's guys did you see the
xbxtkPxEpIE,2041200,2047600,rowy's it's got him can i actually go  inside now  thank you
xbxtkPxEpIE,2047600,2053200,wow  let's go
xbxtkPxEpIE,2053200,2057358,right  what is this
xbxtkPxEpIE,2058800,2064720,oh that's the suck water and that's to  blow water
xbxtkPxEpIE,2066320,2073200,okay  i have to soak up water and then i blow  it to  cool down all my stuff
xbxtkPxEpIE,2073200,2080158,this is way more complex than the first  one  hit you into the forward position
xbxtkPxEpIE,2080720,2089599,let's go baby  i can't wait to see what you can do i  can't wait to crank you into fifth gear
xbxtkPxEpIE,2089599,2096000,yeah  i always have hooks on the bottom  but i don't know how it ah
xbxtkPxEpIE,2096000,2103160,there you go i don't know how i get down  there to like get stuff and bring it up  and
xbxtkPxEpIE,2104400,2109359,oh this is a whole thing  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,2110000,2116800,interesting okay  [Music]  highs  look at us go
xbxtkPxEpIE,2116800,2122480,this is dope  these are some really good iterations
xbxtkPxEpIE,2122480,2130720,upon that concept  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,2130720,2136240,where are we going guys  my tree i'll bring you around  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,2136240,2141280,just let me know okay  okay there's a a red bar on that thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,2141280,2148400,on the right so  maybe if that fills then  we're too hot and i need to
xbxtkPxEpIE,2148400,2155760,not die  [Music]  not dying is a big prerequisite for me
xbxtkPxEpIE,2155760,2161390,nope nope nope  a fire warden i put out my fire like a  dum-dum
xbxtkPxEpIE,2161390,2170240,[Music]  god  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,2170240,2175440,are we going faster i feel like i'm not  pumping anything into the bellows right  now
xbxtkPxEpIE,2175920,2182480,let's put this  backwards  actually just put it in the middle
xbxtkPxEpIE,2182480,2189040,because i thought i had to collect water  but i don't see like a water reservoir  so maybe i actually just suck out any
xbxtkPxEpIE,2189040,2194240,water for when i submerge  i'm convinced i'm submerging at some
xbxtkPxEpIE,2194240,2199640,point it's going to happen don't you  guys worry about it
xbxtkPxEpIE,2201119,2207680,oh  we're running out of steam lads  pumper for all she's worth
xbxtkPxEpIE,2207680,2214480,you know these emissions that you're  pumping out right now these fossil fuels  that you're burning is probably the  reason that your world is messed up
xbxtkPxEpIE,2214480,2220079,i'm just saying  where's our battery-powered ones huh
xbxtkPxEpIE,2220960,2227800,okay that is uh that's heating up quite  fast on the right-hand side there
xbxtkPxEpIE,2228079,2233599,can i like  i'll do that  and then can i nope
xbxtkPxEpIE,2233599,2239520,can i use this  yeah  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,2239520,2245920,i didn't see it oh no  what do we do  keep pushing
xbxtkPxEpIE,2245920,2253200,there you go  get out of my way  i am the boat master am i gonna hit that
xbxtkPxEpIE,2253200,2257838,okay ow  okay we've stopped
xbxtkPxEpIE,2258720,2261440,oh what is this
xbxtkPxEpIE,2264960,2271119,is that like sonar  what did we find
xbxtkPxEpIE,2271119,2277280,there must be a faster way out of this  thing right  i don't have to go all the way up to the  top
xbxtkPxEpIE,2282400,2287520,okay what this it's not an engine piece  for the top is it
xbxtkPxEpIE,2288079,2293119,or is it just something i burn  has to be an engine piece for the top
xbxtkPxEpIE,2293119,2300640,right  we're going under water to get past that  thing i have to go underwater i'm  convinced
xbxtkPxEpIE,2305359,2310040,it's not that guys i don't know what it  is
xbxtkPxEpIE,2315359,2322480,okay it's saying there's something under  me  is this just the thing i put in here
xbxtkPxEpIE,2322480,2328880,no clearly not right it's probably just  a light  honestly
xbxtkPxEpIE,2329599,2334920,let's go  under
xbxtkPxEpIE,2340000,2347200,can figure this out i'm a smart man  there we go  see i'm so smart and i'm unbelievably
xbxtkPxEpIE,2347200,2355520,strong  oh god you don't want that you don't  want that you don't want that you got to  get out of there whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,2357200,2360640,nice so much fuel
xbxtkPxEpIE,2362560,2368920,oh they're floating away  okay cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,2369839,2374960,i'm so cool  you wish you were this cool and you
xbxtkPxEpIE,2374960,2382240,never will be that's the funny thing  there's loads of hooks and buttons what
xbxtkPxEpIE,2382240,2387280,do you do  ah
xbxtkPxEpIE,2388400,2395119,hopefully you didn't just take on 16  gallons of water all at once  that would kind of suck
xbxtkPxEpIE,2395119,2400480,okay i feel like i already have too much  fuel  right
xbxtkPxEpIE,2400640,2406079,in the last game i had so much of it  that i didn't know what to do with it  anymore
xbxtkPxEpIE,2406079,2413359,it was just lying around in my ship and  blocked me constantly so i'm like maybe  i shouldn't have as much
xbxtkPxEpIE,2413359,2420880,but also what if this game is different  and i'll need every single ounce of it  that i have  you never know
xbxtkPxEpIE,2423040,2426400,i love my little super suit
xbxtkPxEpIE,2428960,2434319,i'm coming back  maybe there's a way of
xbxtkPxEpIE,2434319,2439839,sucking them up into the ship  through that door at the bottom
xbxtkPxEpIE,2441760,2448480,whatever there's always more efficient  ways of doing things  i don't care
xbxtkPxEpIE,2449839,2453839,you you're coming with me
xbxtkPxEpIE,2456800,2463799,all right i actually need something  you  you're coming with me
xbxtkPxEpIE,2469040,2474240,wait i actually don't know now if this  would have gone in it  no
xbxtkPxEpIE,2474240,2480359,ah so now the thing has a scanner and  it's showing nothing okay interesting
xbxtkPxEpIE,2482319,2489200,get those bellows of bellowing  get those sails assailing even though  we've no wind
xbxtkPxEpIE,2489200,2494640,we'll get wind again eventually  oh that's way too hot that's way too hot
xbxtkPxEpIE,2494640,2500000,what am i doing  i didn't even pay attention to what i  was doing
xbxtkPxEpIE,2504000,2512160,watch out everybody  i'm a sailor man  i've conquered the land and the ocean do
xbxtkPxEpIE,2512160,2518880,you think they're working on a third  game  where it's far  uh
xbxtkPxEpIE,2519920,2525119,fair loan sale fire changing tide far  sky bound
xbxtkPxEpIE,2525119,2530160,so you're up in the air and you have a  plane that you have to take care of  and if you don't constantly monitor it
xbxtkPxEpIE,2530160,2537599,for every second that you're playing  the plane crashes  and kills you
xbxtkPxEpIE,2537599,2540319,pretty sick game
xbxtkPxEpIE,2546160,2549160,nope
xbxtkPxEpIE,2553599,2558960,corner down she's overheating  there
xbxtkPxEpIE,2558960,2564720,i feel like maybe it's just because i'm  new to the game  but i feel like i'm gonna crash into
xbxtkPxEpIE,2564720,2571040,stuff way more in this one  but as we found out last time you can  kind of crash all you want and you'll
xbxtkPxEpIE,2571040,2577960,still be able to mend it eventually  he can get to the end irregardless
xbxtkPxEpIE,2578079,2585119,which is good for me because  i uh i don't have a boat license
xbxtkPxEpIE,2585119,2590440,i shouldn't be driving this thing but  i'm really good at it
xbxtkPxEpIE,2590490,2596639,[Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,2597920,2604318,oh we actually have some wind now  i feel like we're about to come up onto  something
xbxtkPxEpIE,2604839,2611280,um  how do i stop the engine
xbxtkPxEpIE,2612800,2620839,can i just do that it's still going  though  like i want to cut out the engine
xbxtkPxEpIE,2622000,2627200,oh you can just do that oh way handier  okay i'm just burning fuel for no reason
xbxtkPxEpIE,2627200,2632240,now  there has to be a button that just shuts
xbxtkPxEpIE,2632240,2637440,it off right whoa it's happening again  whoa earthquake
xbxtkPxEpIE,2637440,2641040,do not hit my boat
xbxtkPxEpIE,2643200,2646599,don't do it
xbxtkPxEpIE,2649200,2654640,let's just let it burn through that for  now let it cool off  and then i'll i should go put the sails
xbxtkPxEpIE,2654640,2660319,up  oh it takes so long to get out to this
xbxtkPxEpIE,2660319,2665119,though ah can you grab ledges please
xbxtkPxEpIE,2665440,2672160,oh never mind we're coming down again  i knew it i knew we were gonna land upon
xbxtkPxEpIE,2672160,2677838,something like that  all right once we're clear of this  though
xbxtkPxEpIE,2681760,2687760,we're still moving pretty quick though i  guess because we have a current carrying  us
xbxtkPxEpIE,2689599,2694319,okay we have no wind anymore let's just  i'll take this down again
xbxtkPxEpIE,2698640,2706800,i don't like that a current is carrying  me  i have no control over that
xbxtkPxEpIE,2708720,2712720,oh god we're going quite fast as well
xbxtkPxEpIE,2714400,2718760,this is like a mining town right
xbxtkPxEpIE,2721440,2729119,it kind of feels like they they have a  lot of industry going on like with the  trains and the cars and everything's  piled up and disheveled and
xbxtkPxEpIE,2729119,2735040,that  whatever happened like they were booming  in that industry but maybe all the
xbxtkPxEpIE,2735040,2739920,fossil fuels they were burning oh is  that a
xbxtkPxEpIE,2743599,2750480,oh god and now the water disappears  how convenient for you
xbxtkPxEpIE,2756960,2760520,what is happening
xbxtkPxEpIE,2762400,2767119,we're going to start shaking again the  whole ground  whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,2768560,2773400,whoa hold on down hatches

xbxtkPxEpIE,4281600,4288719,did he get scared and run away because  he's a coward  don't run away they swim away
xbxtkPxEpIE,4288719,4295350,either way he did the fish equivalent of  running  yes  through the storm we made it
xbxtkPxEpIE,4295350,4300400,[Music]  i might be going a little fast though
xbxtkPxEpIE,4300400,4306880,i've been feeling about to smash into  whatever that is  i mean i know it's another boat but you  know what i mean
xbxtkPxEpIE,4306880,4311440,whatever this area is look at that look  how pretty

xbxtkPxEpIE,4360960,4367600,on its own  the boat will move forward
xbxtkPxEpIE,4368320,4374080,or not you know why would it  it's not like it's got wind behind it  all right
xbxtkPxEpIE,4374080,4379600,let's just do this that's what i meant  yeah it moves a little bit then

xbxtkPxEpIE,4398960,4404320,you know you don't want to hit it too  hard you want to go in and headbutt them  that'd be a terrible first impression
xbxtkPxEpIE,4404320,4412400,like that  whoa this is like five ladders in one
xbxtkPxEpIE,4412400,4418239,glad you're claiming it not me  oh those big metal things in the  background look like the legs of the big
xbxtkPxEpIE,4418239,4425860,ship thing that i  walked  i mean it might not be hey it's a deer
xbxtkPxEpIE,4425860,4432480,[Music]  kind of scary actually deer are  terrifying they're so strong

xbxtkPxEpIE,4444800,4451840,nice  so i have to put something on this  that's going to go down to my boat
xbxtkPxEpIE,4452480,4459119,see that deer human technology you  wouldn't even know anything about it
xbxtkPxEpIE,4459679,4464880,even though you've survived whatever  happened and all my people are dead  okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,4464880,4469158,do i have to build the cogs

xbxtkPxEpIE,4501600,4507760,do you need to get full of water  how do i
xbxtkPxEpIE,4507840,4513280,is that no what am i doing is that a  nozzle to put water in
xbxtkPxEpIE,4513600,4519760,yes  that's exactly what it is all i have to  do is press the interact button again
xbxtkPxEpIE,4520480,4524920,whoa down we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,4528239,4535119,oh  okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,4535520,4543199,well yeah cool good  i guess that's for my boat thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,4543199,4546080,let's go this one now
xbxtkPxEpIE,4551520,4558640,could have sucked water out with that  thing though so now i'm worried that i  missed something you don't go anywhere
xbxtkPxEpIE,4558960,4565360,ah  my tiny bones  oh  are you okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,4565360,4571120,no you won't even look at me  i feel like i wasn't supposed to do that
xbxtkPxEpIE,4571120,4576880,yet i  absolutely wasn't supposed to do that  yet because i was supposed to write it  all the way to the top can you like
xbxtkPxEpIE,4576880,4582960,float like the last guy  nice floating dude
xbxtkPxEpIE,4582960,4589520,real great work  oh i need the thing though  uh
xbxtkPxEpIE,4589760,4596320,wait  can i even anymore now that this is  closed
xbxtkPxEpIE,4596640,4601360,oh guys  i might have done a bad
xbxtkPxEpIE,4602239,4606519,suck the water out of it make it lighter
xbxtkPxEpIE,4608960,4615760,why are you showing me that  i just wanted this
xbxtkPxEpIE,4619040,4624719,okay  nice  okay we go all the way to the top first
xbxtkPxEpIE,4624719,4630560,do something and then come all the way  down i should have known as soon as i  saw  that
xbxtkPxEpIE,4630560,4638639,no  as soon as i saw that we went all the  way to the bottom too easily i should  have known that i did it wrong
xbxtkPxEpIE,4640159,4646960,so that's usually how it goes in video  games  okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,4648400,4653760,i don't know how to hit that button or  what it does but we're going to figure  it out together
xbxtkPxEpIE,4653760,4660960,dude sick tower  whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,4662880,4670560,actually sick tower  sounds like the thx sound
xbxtkPxEpIE,4676800,4682400,what is it doing  look i'm asking you guys a lot of  questions that you're obviously not
xbxtkPxEpIE,4682400,4686000,going to have the answers to i'm sorry
xbxtkPxEpIE,4687840,4693679,oh  why of course of course i wanted that is
xbxtkPxEpIE,4693679,4699599,that a giant magnet so i can suck up  this thing with a crane
xbxtkPxEpIE,4700320,4706120,guys i think it might be a giant magnet  that i can suck that thing up with the  crane
xbxtkPxEpIE,4707280,4712640,now we get the water going  more water yeah push me harder push me
xbxtkPxEpIE,4712640,4719000,further  even further behind  plus ultra
xbxtkPxEpIE,4722400,4730080,down we go  has to be a magnet right it's got a  little hook on the top of it it's going
xbxtkPxEpIE,4730719,4735840,that's what magnets do  it's the sound they make
xbxtkPxEpIE,4736000,4739280,there's her nuclear bomb
xbxtkPxEpIE,4742960,4748360,i don't know how this thing helps my  ship thing though
xbxtkPxEpIE,4751360,4755440,i don't know if i did anything right  here
xbxtkPxEpIE,4757440,4762360,can i like attach this to it
xbxtkPxEpIE,4762719,4767600,maybe if i  if i give her a length
xbxtkPxEpIE,4768560,4774800,give you a length of rope you know  here we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,4774800,4780000,here we go  that's using your noodle
xbxtkPxEpIE,4780640,4786880,ha ha  what does all the stuff in the  background mean though i'm so confused
xbxtkPxEpIE,4786880,4791560,is that like a town from a top-down view
xbxtkPxEpIE,4793520,4799120,this here  seems like a town and then this seems  like a  a barrier
xbxtkPxEpIE,4799120,4804800,like a dam to keep the water out like  they have in the netherlands  like to push the ocean back
xbxtkPxEpIE,4804800,4808880,and then this is like another city out  in the ocean
xbxtkPxEpIE,4809840,4813840,that's kind of what it looks like  looking down on top of it
xbxtkPxEpIE,4815679,4821679,um right so  i don't know if i'm supposed to turn  this
xbxtkPxEpIE,4821679,4827440,here's my thinking  do i turn  do i try oh i can't get back up the
xbxtkPxEpIE,4827440,4835679,ladder  do i try and pull no i think i just  lower it down with this crane right
xbxtkPxEpIE,4835840,4840000,but unless this  door opened
xbxtkPxEpIE,4841120,4848960,there's there is no door  oh my god i just realized what i got
xbxtkPxEpIE,4848960,4854159,i got a submersible tank  put that in there just so i don't lose  it
xbxtkPxEpIE,4854159,4861440,it's a thing to weigh down my boat so we  can go underwater  i told you i'm gonna stick it down on
xbxtkPxEpIE,4861440,4868800,top  and then it's gonna go in and then it  has enough water in it that it's gonna  be able to help us sink
xbxtkPxEpIE,4868800,4876159,and then when we wanna get out of it you  put the sucker in and you suck all the  water out it was teaching me the  mechanics of how i'm gonna go sickle
xbxtkPxEpIE,4876159,4881199,mode underwater and then i'm gonna be  the fish
xbxtkPxEpIE,4881600,4887440,i should have just trusted my instincts  i was like i think i need to go back  and use this here and then swing it back
xbxtkPxEpIE,4887440,4895040,around but  i don't  i don't see how this works at all
xbxtkPxEpIE,4900560,4906320,oh  huh
xbxtkPxEpIE,4906320,4914440,you're not the part that i thought was  gonna  sure okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,4917280,4924800,are you gonna go  oh  i forgot it's the other way around now
xbxtkPxEpIE,4925040,4931520,down you go  wait  no that wouldn't make any sense i was  gonna say wait do i suck my entire boat
xbxtkPxEpIE,4931520,4939519,up here with a giant magnet  no it's an engine part
xbxtkPxEpIE,4941120,4948239,was i wrong about everything that i just  said so wholeheartedly and confidently
xbxtkPxEpIE,4949520,4954800,i was like so convinced that i was right  in what i was saying  ow
xbxtkPxEpIE,4954800,4959800,and i don't think that that's what i  ended up doing
xbxtkPxEpIE,4966239,4972159,20 000 leads it is i'm a genius i was  right all along we're going underwater
xbxtkPxEpIE,4972159,4978639,please  let's go
xbxtkPxEpIE,4978639,4985080,oh wait  i gotta put the splooshes in
xbxtkPxEpIE,4987679,4994949,you gotta weigh it down  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,4996560,5001840,that's awesome is that a rubber duck up  there
xbxtkPxEpIE,5002320,5006239,oh my god we're playing subnautica again
xbxtkPxEpIE,5007920,5015600,whoa  that's so cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,5015600,5021440,should i stop in like a little bit  though  until i have clearance
xbxtkPxEpIE,5021440,5027360,yeah  yeah stop it now  okay um
xbxtkPxEpIE,5027360,5033840,this  and then this  yeah put up your sail now what are you
xbxtkPxEpIE,5033840,5040080,gonna do with it  it is a propeller i was so right oh my
xbxtkPxEpIE,5040080,5046320,god i'm a genius  i think we're actually going to smack  the top
xbxtkPxEpIE,5047120,5053679,oh god oh god maybe not so genius maybe  actually dumb
xbxtkPxEpIE,5053679,5060800,maybe stinky man  whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,5061440,5064560,that's awesome
xbxtkPxEpIE,5067199,5073600,also really scary because now i know  something is going to attack me  underwater i know something's going to
xbxtkPxEpIE,5073600,5079920,show up swim by me scare me it's iron  lung all over again
xbxtkPxEpIE,5080080,5085840,and that game was scary enough  i don't need to relive it
xbxtkPxEpIE,5088239,5093840,up  oh hold on  i'm grabbing all sorts of
xbxtkPxEpIE,5093840,5097880,yep you need to do this
xbxtkPxEpIE,5099920,5105280,and we're clear  no we're not no we're not no we're not  no we're not no we're not go again go
xbxtkPxEpIE,5105280,5111120,again go again  okay but that's enough though
xbxtkPxEpIE,5111120,5117280,oh there's so much to manage oh wait i'm  missing so many items  dang it dang it
xbxtkPxEpIE,5117280,5123840,hold on hold on hold on hold on  cut it out
xbxtkPxEpIE,5125600,5131678,i'm missing so much like fuel stuff  can i even get out
xbxtkPxEpIE,5137199,5145520,oh well this is just horrific  this is so scary being down here
xbxtkPxEpIE,5147280,5152400,okay can i leave you there  what are all these like beams are they
xbxtkPxEpIE,5152400,5157520,like  again the legs of the big  giant thing we got last time or are they
xbxtkPxEpIE,5157520,5163120,just structural beams holding stuff up  that have since collapsed  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,5163120,5168600,could be either  i like my theory better though
xbxtkPxEpIE,5175679,5181520,i think the other thing is just a light  but  sometimes you need a light in your life  you know wait let's see if there's
xbxtkPxEpIE,5181520,5186320,anything further back  wee
xbxtkPxEpIE,5187199,5194560,they should put a spongebob reference in  somewhere that'll be cool  see a little spongearoo
xbxtkPxEpIE,5194560,5203040,okay that's too far back i don't care  anymore  if you're that far back i've already  forgotten about you my life has moved on
xbxtkPxEpIE,5208840,5212880,now this is so cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,5214400,5219199,it's a really nice improvement over the  first game
xbxtkPxEpIE,5222960,5229440,uh yeah light  [Music]  because the first game was great and had
xbxtkPxEpIE,5229440,5234480,a lot of cool ideas  um  but this is just kind of taking it to
xbxtkPxEpIE,5234480,5240800,the next level  and upped it even further there's so
xbxtkPxEpIE,5240800,5249040,much so many more complexities to it now  wait didn't i have a another one  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,5249040,5253840,did it fall  does it go down the ladder
xbxtkPxEpIE,5256560,5262239,or was that it no i thought i had  another one oh god i'm losing my mind  i'm losing my mind and i didn't have
xbxtkPxEpIE,5262239,5269440,much to lose in the first place no trust  your instincts jacka boy you're not  losing your mind you're a genius
xbxtkPxEpIE,5270080,5277199,everyone doubting me  excuse me excuse me yep thank you thank  you hold on hold on hold on oh i had
xbxtkPxEpIE,5277199,5284719,stuff down here as well  hold on  got it okay  okay we're ready to go again
xbxtkPxEpIE,5284719,5292040,is is everybody ready everybody  everybody here and accounted for  okay cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,5294320,5298719,we might have to rise a little bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,5300080,5305600,just a smooch  just a smoocher
xbxtkPxEpIE,5306880,5312080,heck yeah look at my little lights i  didn't even notice those before  the lights all the way on the bottom of
xbxtkPxEpIE,5312080,5318239,the ocean  so anything at the bottom of the ocean i  must look like the biggest scariest fish
xbxtkPxEpIE,5318239,5324800,of all time  i gotta get into the habit of setting  this back to  neutral
xbxtkPxEpIE,5326239,5333000,yep yep yep  yep yep that's another big boat or  something there
xbxtkPxEpIE,5341520,5346560,see i think i'm supposed to be using the  hook on the back to pick up all this  stuff but
xbxtkPxEpIE,5346560,5352400,oh gosh  um it's so much faster to just
xbxtkPxEpIE,5352400,5360920,send my little dude out plus it's more  fun  ah  i'm all over the shop
xbxtkPxEpIE,5366880,5372000,oh whoops  i didn't mean to stalk the bellas
xbxtkPxEpIE,5374080,5379440,well whatever's out there that i need to  grab is still a bit away there it is
xbxtkPxEpIE,5379440,5384960,it's not a bit of way it's here it's now  it's today  quench  quench
xbxtkPxEpIE,5384960,5387960,quench
xbxtkPxEpIE,5390420,5396960,[Music]  go little boy go little boy go
xbxtkPxEpIE,5398320,5404800,see this is so quick and then i'm  already back here i don't need to like  go up top grab it with the hook grab one
xbxtkPxEpIE,5404800,5410320,at a time unless there's actually a  mechanic that i'm missing out on and  people are yelling at me about
xbxtkPxEpIE,5410320,5416719,like probably but you know what don't  really care i like sending my little  dude out gives them something to do
xbxtkPxEpIE,5417520,5422800,because i imagine it's supposed to be  like the hook from last time right  whoops
xbxtkPxEpIE,5422800,5428560,the hook from last time  right the hook the sookie from last time
xbxtkPxEpIE,5428560,5435440,like a suction cup thing last time  suction cup why did i say  that going green hey because i burned a
xbxtkPxEpIE,5435440,5441520,plant botanical energy  i had a vacuum on the back of it last  time is what i'm trying to say
xbxtkPxEpIE,5441520,5451280,and failing miserably out  hold hold it there hold it there oh whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,5455840,5462800,oh perfect perfect  like an absolute surgeon
xbxtkPxEpIE,5462800,5468239,clinical  finessed
xbxtkPxEpIE,5470000,5477840,let's stay down here a bit though i  wanna i probably can't go to the surface  but i wanna see what's going on down  here  this is like atlantis
xbxtkPxEpIE,5480719,5486320,okay not a whole lot  the surface is also easier because i
xbxtkPxEpIE,5486320,5493120,might be able to  use my sails  my brain is not firing
xbxtkPxEpIE,5493120,5498400,the way i wanted to  that's cool though
xbxtkPxEpIE,5498400,5505360,this also furthers my theory that  everything was above land at one point  and then the oceans just rose
xbxtkPxEpIE,5505360,5509840,oh my god i'm actually inside somewhere
xbxtkPxEpIE,5516239,5520560,okay there's something to pick up over  there hold on
xbxtkPxEpIE,5524560,5529920,there we go  something to pick up below us maybe i'll
xbxtkPxEpIE,5529920,5535280,use the hook on that one  wait where'd it go oh it's really far
xbxtkPxEpIE,5535280,5541280,away  am i like inside a cave
xbxtkPxEpIE,5541760,5549040,or like i went under and now there's  like a pocket like a dome  that's kind of sick
xbxtkPxEpIE,5549040,5557440,ngl  also means i can't use my sail though
xbxtkPxEpIE,5558800,5564880,oh it's close it's that it's it's right  there  hold on oh crap
xbxtkPxEpIE,5564880,5569679,didn't mean to do that oh wait the  engine stopped anyway nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,5571679,5578960,okay we do need to move forward a tiny  bit though  but i don't want the engine to do it can  i just put up this
xbxtkPxEpIE,5578960,5586080,i know i'm making things  so much more annoying than they need to  be  just like using my systems
xbxtkPxEpIE,5586080,5592880,i could just get out and go swim down  and get it and come back up but  why do that when you have a hook
xbxtkPxEpIE,5592880,5601960,okay that doesn't work down here  normally when you do that it's  like moves forward a tiny bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,5602480,5610719,whatever man whatever  i was gonna believe i hit that switch  multiple times now god dumb
xbxtkPxEpIE,5610719,5615560,nope nope that's not what we're doing  today
xbxtkPxEpIE,5620080,5627920,no that's scary  oh there's so many things though
xbxtkPxEpIE,5628159,5635360,you think the hook can grab multiples  i want to find out i want to see what  it's all about
xbxtkPxEpIE,5635920,5642840,otherwise this is just going to take an  enormous amount of time and i don't want  to do that
xbxtkPxEpIE,5644639,5647920,just move like a smidge
xbxtkPxEpIE,5650880,5657440,honestly that's probably still too far  okay get them lined up with the back of
xbxtkPxEpIE,5657440,5664000,it  that's probably enough
xbxtkPxEpIE,5664000,5667679,that's actually probably too far now
xbxtkPxEpIE,5671199,5673840,all right go on down
xbxtkPxEpIE,5683600,5690080,that's way further down than i thought  it was going to be did you get anything  i don't think you did
xbxtkPxEpIE,5691520,5698639,oh wait i have to hook it on anyway  don't i  okay i'll just send that down
xbxtkPxEpIE,5698639,5702480,i want to know what the point of this  hook is
xbxtkPxEpIE,5706239,5711440,other than like  grabbing stuff to just
xbxtkPxEpIE,5711440,5716639,it doesn't even  it doesn't even i can't even grab these
xbxtkPxEpIE,5716639,5723600,things with it i think it's just to move  debris  that's on the bottom like big debris
xbxtkPxEpIE,5725840,5732239,that's so annoying  maybe i'll get a suction system again
xbxtkPxEpIE,5734239,5739679,it's taking forever  can i like move you
xbxtkPxEpIE,5740880,5746239,no that takes far too fine of movement  for my liking
xbxtkPxEpIE,5746560,5751960,it's okay it's only what 11 years to do  this
xbxtkPxEpIE,5756000,5763840,gosh dang it oh maybe this is like an  anchor maybe i can just send this out  when i want to stop
xbxtkPxEpIE,5763840,5771280,i should have an anchor  i probably do there's probably stuff  that i'm missing but
xbxtkPxEpIE,5771280,5776480,i like things my way  um did i see other stuff over here on
xbxtkPxEpIE,5776480,5781440,the radar  sonar whatever
xbxtkPxEpIE,5781679,5788480,oh there you go  there you go oh now we're talking oh  there you go
xbxtkPxEpIE,5788480,5797239,now it's going to be your time to shine  hopefully i don't actually have to move  you and i can just move the hook
xbxtkPxEpIE,5798480,5806239,this is going to be awesome  i'm like a deep-sea explorer now
xbxtkPxEpIE,5810159,5818239,plonk  yeah what's gonna be down there  the lost city i atlantis
xbxtkPxEpIE,5818239,5821440,i feel like i'm in it already
xbxtkPxEpIE,5824639,5827840,and away we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,5829760,5836239,oh you're just opening a door i thought  you're gonna lift the whole thing this  this makes far more sense
xbxtkPxEpIE,5838560,5846000,trying to think what this would have  been  before the water submerged it though
xbxtkPxEpIE,5849679,5855199,okay i'm opening it the entire way by  the way i know i can probably fit in but  just in case something like floats out
xbxtkPxEpIE,5855199,5863119,or i need my boat to go down there or  something you know  it's better to be safe than stupid
xbxtkPxEpIE,5863600,5869639,also those are c mines over there and  they've all exploded i think
xbxtkPxEpIE,5873199,5881080,just hooked on again  whoa scary face
xbxtkPxEpIE,5883600,5888559,what's in here  whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,5894639,5900880,damn  [Music]  this looks like some sort of nuclear
xbxtkPxEpIE,5900880,5907119,reactor  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,5907119,5912370,oh yeah there we go  there we go should i have brought the  hook with me this entire way
xbxtkPxEpIE,5912370,5920600,[Music]  no because you're gonna make life easy  for me thank you  thank you much much much better
xbxtkPxEpIE,5920600,5926960,[Music]  yeah see this  see this thing that i'm like like in the
xbxtkPxEpIE,5926960,5933119,background behind me now that looks like  my  ship it also looked like that silo that  i was on that i turn the handle and they
xbxtkPxEpIE,5933119,5938800,start spinning on the outside  maybe that's that is exactly what my  boat is
xbxtkPxEpIE,5938800,5944560,submarine  ship  it goes by many names
xbxtkPxEpIE,5948159,5954239,i'm glad it just lets me pull it and i  don't need to like  hit the switch and then get a length of  it or anything like that it's just it's
xbxtkPxEpIE,5954239,5960880,just like yeah just keep dragging it  oh but i get to go below that then after  right
xbxtkPxEpIE,5960880,5967199,this is getting spicy  i like it  i also like that you can
xbxtkPxEpIE,5967199,5972719,probably just not do any of this and  keep moving forward right unless this is  like a prerequisite that i'm going to
xbxtkPxEpIE,5972719,5980280,get an item that i  whoa what's happening unless i'm going  to get an item that i actually needed
xbxtkPxEpIE,5982560,5988080,it's it's doing the thing again nope  nope we're good  we're good
xbxtkPxEpIE,5988080,5994560,seems like we're good  are we  good
xbxtkPxEpIE,5994560,5999360,we're good okay it was doing it it  probably got caught in that hole
xbxtkPxEpIE,6000320,6006800,come on up what do we got  wow
xbxtkPxEpIE,6007360,6012880,treasure being a pirate sucks  all you do is get drunk have an eye
xbxtkPxEpIE,6012880,6017440,patch on and then go wow we got nothing
xbxtkPxEpIE,6018480,6023679,the real money is in  attacking other ships
xbxtkPxEpIE,6023679,6026960,not looting the ocean
xbxtkPxEpIE,6030320,6036000,oh god what did i do  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,6036000,6044080,oh i definitely had to be down there oh  it was a big door okay  how could we not have seen the big door
xbxtkPxEpIE,6044080,6053040,turn on the lights  i opened the door  actually that's so cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,6053360,6058960,is this something i can pick up  it is  it's a little trophy
xbxtkPxEpIE,6059199,6064560,oh wait i guess these lights turned on  really lights though
xbxtkPxEpIE,6064560,6069040,like they don't they're not really  illuminating much are they
xbxtkPxEpIE,6070000,6078760,i'll show you a light  you call that a light look at this
xbxtkPxEpIE,6079040,6085199,cool  little trophy  a little trophy for me because i'm a  good boy
xbxtkPxEpIE,6085199,6090480,okay now i've got a lot of stuff  let me just organize it best i can for a
xbxtkPxEpIE,6090480,6096800,second  yeah now i have too many again
xbxtkPxEpIE,6096800,6101920,but that's fine i'd rather have too many  than too little you know  need it and not have it instead of have
xbxtkPxEpIE,6101920,6110158,it and not needed or have it not needed  and said it needed not have it i got  there in the end you can't tell me
xbxtkPxEpIE,6112080,6119119,okay that's  there's another one up there and i do  have a hook for it but i also don't care
xbxtkPxEpIE,6119119,6121840,i'm leaving
xbxtkPxEpIE,6132400,6138320,oh nice  let's go up top and look at where we're  going
xbxtkPxEpIE,6143040,6150239,oh oh oh  man the ballast  hold fellas hold ow
xbxtkPxEpIE,6150239,6156320,god damn it okay this is your captain  speaking shut up
xbxtkPxEpIE,6156719,6159440,you don't know
xbxtkPxEpIE,6161760,6164719,oh there's more to pick up
xbxtkPxEpIE,6168800,6174239,i don't know where that is though let's  it's fine i have enough stuff picked up
xbxtkPxEpIE,6174239,6177840,i don't need any more
xbxtkPxEpIE,6179990,6188199,[Music]  where are we at all at all
xbxtkPxEpIE,6190000,6194080,maybe go lower it looks cool down there
xbxtkPxEpIE,6196400,6199600,i want to see what we're missing
xbxtkPxEpIE,6201440,6205840,you know i'll probably have to go back  up again soon but
xbxtkPxEpIE,6206639,6211400,at least want to be able to see the  bottom you know
xbxtkPxEpIE,6220719,6226159,man  this is i mean don't get me wrong i  still love the first game but this is so
xbxtkPxEpIE,6226159,6233840,much more intriguing  the fact that you get to see under  the world now
xbxtkPxEpIE,6235840,6238560,just a little bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,6244719,6249840,okay still more  because deep sea stuff is just always so  fascinating it's like what's down there
xbxtkPxEpIE,6249840,6256480,we'll never know until we do  okay we have to surface
xbxtkPxEpIE,6256480,6263360,what if i just keep sucking the water  out and we start flying  i have a propeller what do planes have
xbxtkPxEpIE,6263360,6265920,propellers
xbxtkPxEpIE,6270000,6276560,i can use my sails again  for the first time and what feels like  15 years
xbxtkPxEpIE,6278159,6286080,it's nice to be back in the surface  though in familiar sights  being below into ocean
xbxtkPxEpIE,6286080,6292480,it's  scary  cool  what's scary i feel like i'm  contradicting myself
xbxtkPxEpIE,6292480,6297039,it's so cool down there so much more  intriguing terrifying
xbxtkPxEpIE,6300000,6306639,don't hit that rock  you better not hit that rock okay we're  far enough away
xbxtkPxEpIE,6307280,6313119,all right let the engine die out for a  bit this is far more manageable whoa  what's that
xbxtkPxEpIE,6314000,6319119,what does that do  oh so intriguing
xbxtkPxEpIE,6319119,6324560,my brain is coming up with theories  okay  here's the theory put a giant cannonball
xbxtkPxEpIE,6324560,6331199,in it poof  wait that's a statue of a dude doing  like this it's so creepy looking
xbxtkPxEpIE,6331199,6336719,are they the ancients  i'm glad they're dead
xbxtkPxEpIE,6336719,6340960,it's so scary looking what's wrong with  them
xbxtkPxEpIE,6343199,6349119,it looks like something from star wars  but this is much
xbxtkPxEpIE,6349119,6354360,higher tech looking stuff than what  we've seen before
xbxtkPxEpIE,6359280,6364480,you're gonna hit that rock right you're  actually just gonna sail right on  through like a good boy
xbxtkPxEpIE,6364480,6371320,because why would you it would just be  annoying for the game to do that  oh there you go
xbxtkPxEpIE,6373920,6380880,okay let's let's do that let's actually  let's just do this and then do that oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,6380880,6386239,mercy  can you just like scooch on through
xbxtkPxEpIE,6386239,6392239,though instead of  i don't have to go down turn on the  engine for like two seconds and then put  the sail up you know
xbxtkPxEpIE,6392239,6397119,it's just it's waste my time it wastes  your time
xbxtkPxEpIE,6397440,6402560,i also still have no idea what this  button i'm pushing here is
xbxtkPxEpIE,6404480,6408560,does anybody know can anybody tell me
xbxtkPxEpIE,6409760,6415360,anyway here we go  hatch that hair
xbxtkPxEpIE,6415360,6420639,catch some wind  sail the high seas maybe that other sail
xbxtkPxEpIE,6420639,6424000,only comes out when you go fast enough
xbxtkPxEpIE,6426000,6429840,see  told you
xbxtkPxEpIE,6432239,6438159,god time is absolutely melting away  while i'm playing this game usually you  know you play some games
xbxtkPxEpIE,6438159,6444400,well i guess  a lot of you wouldn't know when i'm  recording some games i'm like oh my god  i won't even record in 30 minutes
xbxtkPxEpIE,6444400,6450560,well less so these days back in the day  when i would record absolutely  everything all the time and just
xbxtkPxEpIE,6450560,6455920,not care as much about what i'm  uploading quality wise  it was just all about quantity it was
xbxtkPxEpIE,6455920,6463119,about getting two videos out every  single day and sometimes i'll be playing  something i'm like man  this is dragging and i would it would be
xbxtkPxEpIE,6463119,6468679,so hard to like get through and then  look over it's like 30 minutes
xbxtkPxEpIE,6471360,6478000,these days less so these days i kind of  pick what i want to play a bit better  because i  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,6478000,6483360,i don't know i i don't upload as often  anymore so it's it's worth kind of like  taking your time to figure out what
xbxtkPxEpIE,6483360,6489600,you're playing like games like this back  in the day i would never have been able  to take like two three hours to record a
xbxtkPxEpIE,6489600,6495040,single game  and that's  it's kind of just where youtube is now  where
xbxtkPxEpIE,6495040,6500239,people want more for their time  people demand more out of you for their  time
xbxtkPxEpIE,6500239,6506080,so editing has to be a bit better your  production value has to be a bit better  your
xbxtkPxEpIE,6506080,6513280,the quality and the quantity in a single  video has to be a bit better  yeah just upload like 15 parts of a
xbxtkPxEpIE,6513280,6519679,like 10 minutes each of a let's play  like  god that was 2012 2012 and 2013 times
xbxtkPxEpIE,6519679,6527840,that's all you had to do it was so easy  back then  but it's good we have standards now
xbxtkPxEpIE,6527840,6532800,where are we going  i feel like i'm going to smack into  something again
xbxtkPxEpIE,6534880,6539920,yep  yep  yep actually just cancel out those all
xbxtkPxEpIE,6539920,6548158,together  nice that was perfect
xbxtkPxEpIE,6549679,6554719,i'm hearing booms  i also like that there's like tins of
xbxtkPxEpIE,6554719,6558000,food everywhere whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,6559760,6567040,it's windy up here  is this just to get these oh wait no
xbxtkPxEpIE,6567040,6573040,usually bucks  oh it's a statue of a dude pulling the  chain
xbxtkPxEpIE,6574320,6580560,dude this is sick  i'm not able to make it though  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,6580560,6587280,okay there's a hook on it  all right use your brain i can't go back
xbxtkPxEpIE,6587280,6592960,either can i just like jump into it  oh wait it's
xbxtkPxEpIE,6593679,6600400,it's like timed oh this is just to hold  on to where the wind goes ah okay i get  it
xbxtkPxEpIE,6600480,6605599,it is like journey  or multiple multiple other games
xbxtkPxEpIE,6605599,6610639,okay go  go  i think i'm faster when i jump
xbxtkPxEpIE,6610639,6617920,if even just a little bit  all right nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,6618239,6624320,these chains like going up into the  mountain in the background are so from  soft
xbxtkPxEpIE,6624320,6629440,like dark souls 2 3 and eldon ring all  have sections like that
xbxtkPxEpIE,6629440,6636040,the other game is not as much they  started doing it more in dark souls 2.
xbxtkPxEpIE,6646719,6653239,all right so  i have to put something into this
xbxtkPxEpIE,6653599,6656880,nope you just gotta do that
xbxtkPxEpIE,6659280,6666760,okay that's all it does so far let's go  down  oh god
xbxtkPxEpIE,6668320,6674080,um  right that's giving us water
xbxtkPxEpIE,6674080,6678080,oh this is another giant engine thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,6679599,6685040,i need some fuel oh  i had so much fuel on the other side of  the
xbxtkPxEpIE,6685040,6690400,thing but  i just realized i probably couldn't have  brought it with me anyway
xbxtkPxEpIE,6690880,6698000,because of the wind  what why'd you let go of that
xbxtkPxEpIE,6699040,6705280,there we go  surely i'm able to put this on the hooks  and there's a button up there that sucks
xbxtkPxEpIE,6705280,6710960,them all up  i like that as well  this is like a good
xbxtkPxEpIE,6710960,6716239,upgrade that the devs made  that you don't have to
xbxtkPxEpIE,6716239,6722198,like do everything  yourself  all the time
xbxtkPxEpIE,6723199,6728480,which switch is which  what do you do
xbxtkPxEpIE,6728639,6734159,nothing  what do you do
xbxtkPxEpIE,6735040,6740638,that has to be the one right  yeah there they go
xbxtkPxEpIE,6742880,6749239,nice okay  now we can get you going
xbxtkPxEpIE,6754400,6760079,i don't know what for oh  powering up that
xbxtkPxEpIE,6763360,6768800,nice  tip to stay in this but that's what the
xbxtkPxEpIE,6768800,6773840,water is for now because  you'll overheat otherwise
xbxtkPxEpIE,6776239,6780560,that makes sense  it's all coming together
xbxtkPxEpIE,6787840,6793840,i don't know how full it is though is it  actually going up in like real time
xbxtkPxEpIE,6796159,6801280,oh am i out of fuel  there's just no way
xbxtkPxEpIE,6801280,6805000,i had so many things
xbxtkPxEpIE,6808159,6814719,it's okay  we'll fuel you up again in no time  because i have a second one coming in
xbxtkPxEpIE,6814719,6818119,double the power
xbxtkPxEpIE,6822800,6828000,oh wait the sides are filling up as well  oh i didn't see that
xbxtkPxEpIE,6830880,6835920,cool  if i run out of energy though see the
xbxtkPxEpIE,6835920,6842880,three little things are filling up on  the left  and there's like a big bar going down  the middle
xbxtkPxEpIE,6844480,6848199,yeah keep it fueled
xbxtkPxEpIE,6859760,6867920,that's be enough now right yeah it is  i don't know what i'm doing
xbxtkPxEpIE,6870159,6875400,uh  wow
xbxtkPxEpIE,6877520,6885440,what  holy god that was cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,6885840,6893280,and now we can hook it  that was dope
xbxtkPxEpIE,6896400,6901440,love that  oh wait and the whole place is upside
xbxtkPxEpIE,6901440,6906719,down so that means  this oh yeah there's the hooks
xbxtkPxEpIE,6906880,6915080,that's so bizarre to see  i'm doing it guys i'm doing it
xbxtkPxEpIE,6918080,6923199,you're just gonna hook on though right i  don't need to like  do anything yeah
xbxtkPxEpIE,6923199,6928320,thank god  again another thing  some games would have made you go all
xbxtkPxEpIE,6928320,6935840,the way down and then do it and then  what is happening
xbxtkPxEpIE,6939599,6943880,oh  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,6946239,6952639,this game has blown my mind  so cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,6954159,6959400,i don't know how this works but it's not  up to me to figure it out
xbxtkPxEpIE,6960560,6965840,and now you go down into my boat  marine ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,6965840,6974039,my ship marine  what's that gonna allow me to do though
xbxtkPxEpIE,6976960,6982560,i mean i'll take another engine piece  any day  okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,6982560,6989440,i have a lot there's a lot of this stuff  but i can't really house most of it  i mean i can hold on to it but i can't
xbxtkPxEpIE,6989440,6995679,use any of it really  yeah stay up here why not
xbxtkPxEpIE,6995679,6999040,nope oh god damn it
xbxtkPxEpIE,7001520,7007440,i i don't know where this one's gonna  take me i don't know what this is gonna  allow me to do
xbxtkPxEpIE,7008480,7016679,ancient energy  am i able to just like  blast stuff in front of me
xbxtkPxEpIE,7016880,7022158,that would be cool  i'ma do it
xbxtkPxEpIE,7022639,7028638,let me hit the button let me hit the  button  oh wait
xbxtkPxEpIE,7029199,7033198,how do i  huh
xbxtkPxEpIE,7034320,7038760,do i need fuel and energy or something
xbxtkPxEpIE,7047920,7053840,i don't know how i  triggered that one  oh yeah
xbxtkPxEpIE,7054159,7057800,it went like red
xbxtkPxEpIE,7059760,7064960,does that mean it's doing something oh  maybe when it's in the blue  it was teaching me
xbxtkPxEpIE,7064960,7068320,that makes so much sense now
xbxtkPxEpIE,7071040,7078560,i gotta say the game does a really good  job of teaching you  like fresh mechanics all the time
xbxtkPxEpIE,7080000,7087119,like doing it in that other building  to now know how to do it here
xbxtkPxEpIE,7087119,7089920,it's really clever
xbxtkPxEpIE,7092880,7099599,oh we are gonna  blast this  wait hold on
xbxtkPxEpIE,7099599,7105280,it's not staying in the bar i was  wondering why there was like the green  bar at the end of that one
xbxtkPxEpIE,7105280,7111280,was there  wow
xbxtkPxEpIE,7111280,7118000,supercharged engine  let's go
xbxtkPxEpIE,7120000,7125280,that's cool  god we got so much power
xbxtkPxEpIE,7126080,7132800,all the more reason to like stay charged  in this zone now does it hold on to the  energy do you think
xbxtkPxEpIE,7133440,7139039,oh i probably shouldn't be using this  seafarer
xbxtkPxEpIE,7139280,7143840,like if i charge it up will it stay  there
xbxtkPxEpIE,7145040,7150159,who knows  somebody does because somebody's tried  it
xbxtkPxEpIE,7150560,7158158,yes  [Music]  i love the colors
xbxtkPxEpIE,7166880,7173460,still not sure if i'm doing the sales  right or not but  you know we're making progress that's  all that matters
xbxtkPxEpIE,7173460,7176619,[Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,7181920,7189360,heck  yeah yeah i guess we do need a nighttime  scene we had one in the previous game
xbxtkPxEpIE,7189360,7194630,you know what i'm just gonna enjoy this  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,7197360,7202400,you can spend so much time doing busy  work in the game but  it's this kind of stuff that's
xbxtkPxEpIE,7202400,7207159,the most fun sometimes it's just hanging  out
xbxtkPxEpIE,7212180,7218719,[Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,7218719,7226320,so peaceful yeah we get to see the stars  oh no i see another storm cloud ahead of
xbxtkPxEpIE,7226320,7230960,me  we're gonna be for a rough ride guys
xbxtkPxEpIE,7232960,7239320,there we go  a full perpendicular mast
xbxtkPxEpIE,7242159,7250960,maybe how high the flag is up and down  determines how  far forward my sails should be
xbxtkPxEpIE,7251280,7254678,i don't know
xbxtkPxEpIE,7257599,7263760,you're gonna really disrupt my peace  aren't you  this is far too peaceful for a game like  this
xbxtkPxEpIE,7263760,7269840,you're gonna do something where you're  gonna assault me with lightning you're  gonna hit my mast it's gonna go down i'm
xbxtkPxEpIE,7269840,7273800,gonna go under the ocean
xbxtkPxEpIE,7289119,7296280,there's slowing down a lot though oh  jellyfish  wait i want to be under
xbxtkPxEpIE,7296560,7302480,yeah we have a ton of stuff i'm gonna oh  my god grab the right things please
xbxtkPxEpIE,7303199,7309800,i'm gonna go below deck  and we're gonna go underwater
xbxtkPxEpIE,7312159,7319119,because i see some jellyfish coming and  i see a storm coming and i just want to  be where the jellyfish are
xbxtkPxEpIE,7320719,7325320,okay it does hold on to the energy  that's good
xbxtkPxEpIE,7325760,7332159,yes  oh that's so pretty
xbxtkPxEpIE,7335040,7339000,okay not too far down though
xbxtkPxEpIE,7340080,7344520,i'm so glad i did that
xbxtkPxEpIE,7352480,7359199,that is actually a reason to get to the  full bower i like that  wow
xbxtkPxEpIE,7363679,7367080,that's sick
xbxtkPxEpIE,7374719,7378280,i love that
xbxtkPxEpIE,7383520,7388000,oh we're under the ocean you think the  engine would stay cool huh
xbxtkPxEpIE,7389679,7395760,and one with the jellyfish  [Music]  jellyfish power oh this is about to go
xbxtkPxEpIE,7395760,7401760,on fire  should i do it guys
xbxtkPxEpIE,7401760,7409560,ultra instinct oh i can't the engine cut  off  okay here we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,7415520,7420360,oh wait the energy goes back down dang  it
xbxtkPxEpIE,7422480,7428800,so if i'm gonna do it i might as well  like  do it immediately whenever i charge it  up
xbxtkPxEpIE,7435199,7439920,here we go  here we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,7446560,7451719,nice  out of my way jellyfish
xbxtkPxEpIE,7454400,7461520,yeah i see lightning and rain up there  god what a pretty video game
xbxtkPxEpIE,7462960,7471440,i know i'm missing stuff on the ocean  floor as well but  i'm not really too bothered about it  since i have so many things on board
xbxtkPxEpIE,7471920,7476159,which i'm probably going to run out of  quicker than i think i am
xbxtkPxEpIE,7477280,7480559,now it would be fine i have a bunch
xbxtkPxEpIE,7488960,7495679,the question is just when i go above  water and when i don't  the ice
xbxtkPxEpIE,7496480,7501760,let's go back up now  jellyfish are over i don't want to be
xbxtkPxEpIE,7501760,7507158,down here  i wanted to just be jellyfish gang
xbxtkPxEpIE,7508639,7511280,yeah it's ice
xbxtkPxEpIE,7517599,7523440,um and i get to use my  sails when i'm up here
xbxtkPxEpIE,7526000,7532840,oh there's so much going on i'm like  where do i go up down left right where  uh over here
xbxtkPxEpIE,7545840,7548840,nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,7555599,7561440,look how pretty that is  i love those clouds
xbxtkPxEpIE,7561440,7568000,it looks so fluffy  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,7568000,7573760,this is bad am i about to  am i about to run aground
xbxtkPxEpIE,7574880,7581920,okay oh hold on hold on hold your horses  there for a second let's slow that on  down
xbxtkPxEpIE,7582480,7586719,slow that down to a crawl for a second
xbxtkPxEpIE,7588159,7593440,is that a blimp  okay that's too slow
xbxtkPxEpIE,7598639,7603239,that looks like a like a hindenburg  blimp
xbxtkPxEpIE,7608000,7612320,right  i'm not crazy
xbxtkPxEpIE,7617360,7622320,ah dang it  he's smacking into it
xbxtkPxEpIE,7627040,7630920,yeah i don't know what that does
xbxtkPxEpIE,7632239,7638639,stick them all the way back but don't  take them off yet  let me fix some stuff
xbxtkPxEpIE,7638800,7642239,oh wait lots of stuff broke
xbxtkPxEpIE,7644400,7648800,oh no that's water splashing i thought  those are sparks
xbxtkPxEpIE,7653679,7658960,uh let's put you down the stairs because  i'm worried that  if i ever have to go underwater quickly
xbxtkPxEpIE,7658960,7663520,which i'm known to do  that i lose you
xbxtkPxEpIE,7670400,7678320,don't send another storm my way  i'm sick of them  i just want to sail the seas in peace
xbxtkPxEpIE,7686159,7692400,the more i play though the more i am  convinced that  i'm the person who picked up the
xbxtkPxEpIE,7692400,7699210,character from the last game  that boat that went  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,7700480,7706400,i mean i'm going left to right  and that came from right to left but
xbxtkPxEpIE,7706400,7710320,i know i feel like it would be cool to  do that right
xbxtkPxEpIE,7714840,7719920,wheel or big scary fish  either or
xbxtkPxEpIE,7719920,7728480,i think it's just a whale  it's probably just a whale all along but  big scary fish is big scary fish
xbxtkPxEpIE,7729119,7736159,dang it i'm not fast enough  but i can be
xbxtkPxEpIE,7738400,7744719,oh that's not a lot of fuel is it  i burn through all my things oh god  maybe i don't have as much as i thought
xbxtkPxEpIE,7744719,7746960,i did
xbxtkPxEpIE,7750000,7758360,there he goes the whale wow  thank you whale
xbxtkPxEpIE,7758480,7761119,cool to see you
xbxtkPxEpIE,7766880,7773280,that was the only reason i kind of sped  up though  was to see that whale  now he's gone oh should i go below oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,7773280,7779199,i'm going below again  do i actually need to get rid of all
xbxtkPxEpIE,7779199,7784599,these things when i do that or is it  does it do it itself
xbxtkPxEpIE,7790320,7797840,maybe that's like a hint that the whale  showed up and the game's kind of like  yeah you should probably go below deck  or go below the ocean
xbxtkPxEpIE,7797840,7804159,hold on  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,7804159,7809440,i want to go out  because now i am kind of running a
xbxtkPxEpIE,7809440,7815550,little low on stuff  oh this is too far out though
xbxtkPxEpIE,7815550,7821520,[Music]  was that lightning that just hit my ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,7823520,7826840,what's happening
xbxtkPxEpIE,7828719,7834320,wait didn't i see stuff  oh god is that lightning just hitting
xbxtkPxEpIE,7834320,7840400,the water  i thought i saw stuff back here  oh that's too far away that's too far
xbxtkPxEpIE,7840400,7847920,away no you can't do that  the screen was getting dark i think it  was gonna kill me if i did that
xbxtkPxEpIE,7851040,7855079,where did i see stuff then
xbxtkPxEpIE,7856320,7860158,maybe it's in  here
xbxtkPxEpIE,7863920,7871239,hmm  well that's terrifying
xbxtkPxEpIE,7871840,7875920,well that's super terrifying where's my  boat
xbxtkPxEpIE,7880639,7885840,i am glad that i brought you below the  surface
xbxtkPxEpIE,7890159,7895920,oh my sona is not detecting anything now  yes it is  like right
xbxtkPxEpIE,7895920,7901040,behind me but it's not at the bottom so  maybe it's floating
xbxtkPxEpIE,7901040,7908779,i'm determined to find whatever this is  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,7912880,7924159,no i'm just losing my mind  there's nothing here  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,7924159,7931199,whatever let's just keep going  there'll be more stuff to get in the  future
xbxtkPxEpIE,7931199,7936880,almost done too far  i like how the boat's doors open but it  doesn't explain how it keeps the water
xbxtkPxEpIE,7936880,7941840,out  it's just like yeah whatever
xbxtkPxEpIE,7943440,7948560,i probably have enough anyway we're fine  if we're freaking out we're grand
xbxtkPxEpIE,7948560,7952440,don't even worry about it
xbxtkPxEpIE,7958800,7964960,we'll move some of these over though  this is a much nicer system for the
xbxtkPxEpIE,7964960,7971199,engine too  to have it operate off that crane so i
xbxtkPxEpIE,7971199,7977118,can just oh i didn't  i guess i'm doing that
xbxtkPxEpIE,7977760,7982920,wait this stuff working oh i overfed it
xbxtkPxEpIE,7984480,7989599,there we go  i'm not missing anything on the surface  right
xbxtkPxEpIE,7989599,7995040,we're good  wait what if that item is oh my god is  that item just the thing that's in the
xbxtkPxEpIE,7995040,7998079,back of my ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,8000800,8007040,i think it's just the thing that's at  the back in the house part  are you kidding me
xbxtkPxEpIE,8007040,8015198,here we go  this gives you such a boost that it's  like why wouldn't you do it
xbxtkPxEpIE,8018210,8023480,[Music]  this music is so ominous
xbxtkPxEpIE,8027840,8033440,that's a crazy boost  yeah the thing is following me so it's
xbxtkPxEpIE,8033440,8038639,just a piece in the back of my ship  i can't believe that
xbxtkPxEpIE,8038639,8043520,i can't believe that i wasted that much  time going looking for it
xbxtkPxEpIE,8045119,8049800,oh dc's they'll play tricks on you
xbxtkPxEpIE,8054079,8060079,am i like  solving a film noir case with that music
xbxtkPxEpIE,8061440,8068000,we're waiting for the pink panther to  show  up to be a little lower down
xbxtkPxEpIE,8068000,8071679,i'm afraid the lightning is going to hit  me anyway
xbxtkPxEpIE,8076480,8079960,here we go again
xbxtkPxEpIE,8086000,8092400,nice  what's going on up there huh  is zeus mad
xbxtkPxEpIE,8092400,8099119,poseidon is chill poseidon's just like  yeah whatever swim through no one cares
xbxtkPxEpIE,8099119,8103360,but zeus is trying to damn it all to  hell
xbxtkPxEpIE,8105119,8112400,oh we ran out of fuel dang it  and i also hit the wrong thing dang it
xbxtkPxEpIE,8116340,8121360,[Music]  that lightning is still scary that would
xbxtkPxEpIE,8121360,8126800,have messed up my  my ship marine a lot  that would have messed up all bessie
xbxtkPxEpIE,8126800,8133199,quite a bit  and we've we've people to save and
xbxtkPxEpIE,8133199,8137480,places to be we can't be doing that
xbxtkPxEpIE,8138719,8144400,hopefully we get out of the storm soon  though  the last game only had one storm section
xbxtkPxEpIE,8144400,8151840,this games had like three  oh no no
xbxtkPxEpIE,8151840,8157599,just do that  that counts why not  no
xbxtkPxEpIE,8157599,8161679,keeps grabbing two things at once i  don't like that
xbxtkPxEpIE,8163360,8170159,we're going to do it again  or not we ran out of fuel at the worst  time  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,8170159,8174760,dang it i'm like almost all out of  everything
xbxtkPxEpIE,8178400,8184880,okay so the the energy that you need for  that oh  wait
xbxtkPxEpIE,8184880,8193840,everything's fine now  you hear that the lightning's gone  that seems like it's daytime up above
xbxtkPxEpIE,8195920,8202719,yeah whoa  that's cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,8202719,8208319,glad i got to see that  um
xbxtkPxEpIE,8208319,8214478,yeah why not we almost have the ultra  energy charged up we might as well go  for it it's cool i'll set up the sails
xbxtkPxEpIE,8214478,8222160,then as well  we'll go full blast on everything it'll  be awesome everyone will cheer
xbxtkPxEpIE,8225280,8232439,i like that it kind of hums before it's  about to do it  to let you know like yeah you're almost  charged
xbxtkPxEpIE,8240000,8248040,no wrong one  pull down that engine  god we're going so fast holy
xbxtkPxEpIE,8250240,8253040,that was awesome
xbxtkPxEpIE,8255598,8260199,let me just uh fix the sail
xbxtkPxEpIE,8264000,8269678,nice  oh lots of wind behind us on this one oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,8269678,8274880,yeah  oh yeah as long as you don't bang into  anything
xbxtkPxEpIE,8275439,8279519,and the engines have cooled off nice  perfect
xbxtkPxEpIE,8282080,8287280,if it's going to be anything like the  last game  we're going to get to like a big  building
xbxtkPxEpIE,8287280,8293678,at some point and then that's we should  be higher above the water we're kind of  dipping a little
xbxtkPxEpIE,8294399,8299840,so i accidentally turned this to that  when i shouldn't have
xbxtkPxEpIE,8301518,8308639,here you  go i wonder if gonna end up in a big  building again with like a giant robot
xbxtkPxEpIE,8308880,8312080,i'm not gonna light that was sick
xbxtkPxEpIE,8316319,8321840,what am i looking at more blimps  maybe that is the thing maybe the third
xbxtkPxEpIE,8321840,8327200,game they'll do one where you actually  control a blimp  that would make a lot of sense because
xbxtkPxEpIE,8327200,8333439,it's a lot like these maybe that's what  they're hinting at  okay nice we can push past that anyway
xbxtkPxEpIE,8333439,8337519,the sail is probably gonna hit that a  little bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,8341598,8345719,crap crap crap
xbxtkPxEpIE,8347359,8353438,no crap  very epic  actually wait
xbxtkPxEpIE,8354960,8360960,i need you to scooch for just a smidge  just a smidge just a tiny little bit the
xbxtkPxEpIE,8360960,8368639,tiniest amount that any of you could  even fathom  just like that yeah yeah
xbxtkPxEpIE,8368880,8374719,because i realized that wasn't going to  hit that anyway i was going to hit that  other thing first  all right cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,8374719,8377598,and away we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,8382478,8390800,okay  see more helmets like the one i'm  wearing seagulls
xbxtkPxEpIE,8392960,8396479,see what is this in the picture
xbxtkPxEpIE,8398000,8403040,it looks like it's coming right at you  like it's a giant ship bursting with the  sun shining behind it
xbxtkPxEpIE,8403040,8409280,and there's floating robots going next  to it  it could be just a city and the main  little thing in it but
xbxtkPxEpIE,8409280,8413000,i prefer my theory
xbxtkPxEpIE,8416880,8422800,okay  okay let's leave you loose for now
xbxtkPxEpIE,8422800,8427720,just in case i need to to pick up the  slack
xbxtkPxEpIE,8430800,8434318,peter patter pitter patter pitter patter
xbxtkPxEpIE,8437280,8441521,nice agile  athletic
xbxtkPxEpIE,8443359,8449200,because the ending to the previous game  like blew my mind like the big thing  happening and i kind of want something
xbxtkPxEpIE,8449200,8454960,like that again  like big robot or something i know i'm  probably supposed to go to the right but  i want to i want to check what's back
xbxtkPxEpIE,8454960,8459160,here i want to get a big view
xbxtkPxEpIE,8460640,8465840,turns out it's nothing guys waste of  time  uh pro tip for uh fire changing tides
xbxtkPxEpIE,8465840,8472279,don't go back there  that's my gamer guide
xbxtkPxEpIE,8476240,8479240,whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,8486319,8492560,i i don't know if i should be doing this  or if i should not  i
xbxtkPxEpIE,8492560,8497239,don't know what any of this is for
xbxtkPxEpIE,8500000,8507280,is as far as it goes though  maybe i was supposed to walk out on it
xbxtkPxEpIE,8507280,8514040,i'll bring it back underneath but i  don't know what the purpose of that is
xbxtkPxEpIE,8516800,8523760,oh so big and menacing  because it has a little line on it like
xbxtkPxEpIE,8523760,8529359,right here this patch to line up with  that ladder so it must mean something  right
xbxtkPxEpIE,8529359,8534319,oh  well i'm locked in
xbxtkPxEpIE,8534720,8537720,oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,8545120,8547601,okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,8551120,8555720,i can't get back to where i needed to be  though now
xbxtkPxEpIE,8556720,8564000,ah  cheeky  i don't like that that's sneaky
xbxtkPxEpIE,8564000,8570120,i mean i only had two directions to go  so what else were you gonna do
xbxtkPxEpIE,8570640,8576240,can i fall  sure  yep
xbxtkPxEpIE,8576240,8580521,of course you can do whatever you want
xbxtkPxEpIE,8593040,8599840,am i picking up something in the ocean  oh yeah i am
xbxtkPxEpIE,8603359,8608800,nice  epic
xbxtkPxEpIE,8608800,8616560,you are you qualified for that  absolutely not  i'm barely qualified to breathe
xbxtkPxEpIE,8620160,8627520,and even then that's difficult sometimes  you know asthma  you got asthma
xbxtkPxEpIE,8627520,8635680,okay we should probably submerge then  right because the  i think even just to get past
xbxtkPxEpIE,8635680,8640840,that piece that we just put in we'll  have to submerge
xbxtkPxEpIE,8646479,8653680,okay  put you back to neutral uh put some  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,8653680,8659600,fuel in the fire oh there's lots of  stuff around let me go and get this  thing because it's
xbxtkPxEpIE,8659600,8665280,have you just been floating there  following me how does that even work  they get stuck in the slipstream behind
xbxtkPxEpIE,8665280,8669841,me  explain yourself
xbxtkPxEpIE,8670640,8675040,i mean i'm glad you're here because  you're going to give me a lot of energy  but
xbxtkPxEpIE,8675920,8679640,that don't make any sense
xbxtkPxEpIE,8682960,8688720,what's all here then  oh  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,8688720,8692479,dare i come back out and do that
xbxtkPxEpIE,8695439,8702398,oh you're attached to that i thought you  were just floating  uh let me see if there's anything  further back
xbxtkPxEpIE,8703920,8710640,just in case  doubtful doubtful that's a negative on  that one let's just do this one
xbxtkPxEpIE,8710640,8719479,it's so weird though that this whole  canister you bring up and it just breaks  and gives you like  a potato sack full of something
xbxtkPxEpIE,8724720,8732640,down you go  i don't know if i have to hold this i  think  yeah it's probably fine
xbxtkPxEpIE,8732640,8736199,it'll go down regardless
xbxtkPxEpIE,8740240,8746640,i want to do this in real life  actually do i know  going down
xbxtkPxEpIE,8746640,8754880,like 50 feet  into the water i feel like my  the pressure in my head would explode
xbxtkPxEpIE,8755520,8762240,even just going like eight meters down  in a swimming pool i'm like huh  my ears are gonna burst
xbxtkPxEpIE,8764840,8771040,nice more  wow  that was a lot
xbxtkPxEpIE,8771040,8776800,you actually did something cool  thank you  i have to bring you in or my
xbxtkPxEpIE,8776800,8784080,my thing is going to freak out  and be like where what's going on
xbxtkPxEpIE,8784479,8790880,i should put you there actually yeah  yeah yeah ah climb for god's sake
xbxtkPxEpIE,8790880,8796240,actually claim for your own sake  god can climb
xbxtkPxEpIE,8796240,8802880,at least i would hope so be  a pretty crap god if you couldn't climb
xbxtkPxEpIE,8803200,8808560,someone's going to point out to me now  where there's a religion where a god  can't climb and that's part of the  religion
xbxtkPxEpIE,8808560,8812641,and they'll be like but you feel bad now  don't you
xbxtkPxEpIE,8813600,8819359,all right away we go  the fires of industry are roaring once
xbxtkPxEpIE,8819359,8822359,more
xbxtkPxEpIE,8825439,8831520,we can go a little lower  just a little bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,8831760,8837319,maybe we can cuz i think we're dragging  ourselves along the ground right now
xbxtkPxEpIE,8838720,8842398,all right fill up one bar of this thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,8846479,8851600,that's all i need right now just one bar  from you you can do one bar can't you
xbxtkPxEpIE,8851600,8856641,maybe even two bars yeah go for it go  for it get two bars out of it
xbxtkPxEpIE,8859520,8867681,but that's probably all we need actually  because uh  i kind of want to use the sails
xbxtkPxEpIE,8870880,8876960,um  let's send this back  wait is it a good idea to use the sails
xbxtkPxEpIE,8876960,8879840,yeah it's a great idea
xbxtkPxEpIE,8883200,8888840,i want to see what we're coming up  against above the ocean
xbxtkPxEpIE,8892000,8897439,actually do we have much we don't really  have a whole lot of wind do we
xbxtkPxEpIE,8898240,8903680,that's enough  it's enough wind  a little breeze
xbxtkPxEpIE,8903680,8909280,a little  that'll get us where we need to go
xbxtkPxEpIE,8914640,8919399,plenty of wind what are you talking  about
xbxtkPxEpIE,8920160,8928080,unless we're just going to crash into  icebergs and titanic ourselves  then it would have just stayed below
xbxtkPxEpIE,8928319,8934960,but i like it up here it's nice  that's where humans are meant to be not
xbxtkPxEpIE,8934960,8937920,below the ocean
xbxtkPxEpIE,8941200,8948040,okay there  it gives you like a little indicator for  when you're catching the most wind
xbxtkPxEpIE,8949359,8952080,which is smart
xbxtkPxEpIE,8958000,8964560,yeah there's another one  i'm literally just writing in a silo  that's sideways
xbxtkPxEpIE,8968160,8974160,not going that fast  see my  my desire to
xbxtkPxEpIE,8974160,8979359,keep resources is far outweighed by my  desire to go fast  and
xbxtkPxEpIE,8979359,8982681,eat ass
xbxtkPxEpIE,8999520,9006640,oh is that something oh  are these crashes
xbxtkPxEpIE,9006960,9013040,nah we're fine just push it out of your  way  you're like an icebreaker  one of those ships
xbxtkPxEpIE,9013040,9019840,whoa  look at that
xbxtkPxEpIE,9020720,9024318,that's pretty sick ngo
xbxtkPxEpIE,9030479,9036880,i want the super boost  ever since you gave it to me i just  crave the super boost
xbxtkPxEpIE,9036880,9041080,that's all i'm going to want to do  forever
xbxtkPxEpIE,9048720,9053761,superb  boost
xbxtkPxEpIE,9056319,9061840,let's get up top  i want to feel the wind in my hair
xbxtkPxEpIE,9062960,9068240,yeah baby  yeah  that's what it's all about that's how
xbxtkPxEpIE,9068240,9072561,you go full steam ahead you got it
xbxtkPxEpIE,9073520,9076880,i'm not catching wind on my sails
xbxtkPxEpIE,9079680,9085521,wait where is the wind on my sails  why am i not catching it anywhere
xbxtkPxEpIE,9087359,9094399,sails  wind  anything there you go
xbxtkPxEpIE,9100240,9103840,oh  we're out
xbxtkPxEpIE,9109520,9115280,i wonder if it's actually worth the  energy  the energy that you spend to get that
xbxtkPxEpIE,9115280,9119680,super boost i wonder if it's even worth  it
xbxtkPxEpIE,9121200,9125549,like the distance it covers  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,9126960,9133760,what a ship  what a beautiful ship  what a beautiful ship marine
xbxtkPxEpIE,9136080,9140720,proud to call her my own  good old bessie
xbxtkPxEpIE,9141359,9145240,she's mine and mine only
xbxtkPxEpIE,9154160,9159840,we're getting some serious wave break  right now  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,9160240,9167280,well that's not good  just smash straight into that thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,9167280,9173319,oh i didn't need to go up and do my  sails every time it just does it on its  own
xbxtkPxEpIE,9175600,9179520,oh except that part oh wait yeah it does
xbxtkPxEpIE,9181120,9184120,whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,9187439,9194640,damn  oh it's so peaceful

xbxtkPxEpIE,9211680,9216240,oh we're going way down this is the  deepest i've been
xbxtkPxEpIE,9220480,9226439,[Music]  oh that's terrifying
xbxtkPxEpIE,9228880,9234319,my little flippers didn't go in though  i should
xbxtkPxEpIE,9234319,9241160,do this  oh actually no i shouldn't i should keep  filling it with water
xbxtkPxEpIE,9245359,9248359,oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,9256080,9260880,i forgot that i can actually go a little  bit backwards now
xbxtkPxEpIE,9263520,9268120,you can actually ask your thing to go  back
xbxtkPxEpIE,9274880,9278479,okay that was a mistake clearly
xbxtkPxEpIE,9282640,9287601,okay where am i  whoa
xbxtkPxEpIE,9288000,9291920,there's a bunch of stuff out here i want  to go collect
xbxtkPxEpIE,9296640,9302880,we're in a very scary place right now  giant tube underwater
xbxtkPxEpIE,9304640,9312120,would anybody be okay with that  i'd be me britches
xbxtkPxEpIE,9314200,9321760,[Music]  okay okay nice  oh those like gloopy gloop glue is
xbxtkPxEpIE,9321760,9327560,really like messing with my ears it  makes me feel like i'm underwater
xbxtkPxEpIE,9331120,9336240,the engine's ready to pop too oh don't  worry you'll get your chance
xbxtkPxEpIE,9336240,9341000,i'm about to let loose on this bad boy
xbxtkPxEpIE,9341520,9348239,okay cool  there is something else nearby though
xbxtkPxEpIE,9353200,9356319,full steam ahead
xbxtkPxEpIE,9363359,9369600,let me stay down here for a second  if that thing that i can pick up is  nearby then i can just grab it and then
xbxtkPxEpIE,9369600,9372640,come back into the ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,9375790,9383640,[Music]  okay maybe not  you know just keep going it's more fun  that way
xbxtkPxEpIE,9393920,9397840,oh not needed not needed not needed
xbxtkPxEpIE,9401840,9408880,dang it  i just want to go too fast all the time  at least it doesn't damage much anymore
xbxtkPxEpIE,9408880,9414160,though i think it runs out the fuel  quick  or something i don't know but it doesn't
xbxtkPxEpIE,9414160,9420640,like break anything anymore because i  don't really have something to fix my my  things with anymore
xbxtkPxEpIE,9420640,9427280,oh yeah lots of goodies  we i'm a ballerina
xbxtkPxEpIE,9427520,9434080,oh stay open  it is kind of annoying to have to jump
xbxtkPxEpIE,9434080,9439439,out and grab all these things myself  though  and not have something to suck them up
xbxtkPxEpIE,9439439,9442439,anymore

xbxtkPxEpIE,9480720,9486800,okay is that enough  maybe a little bit more just in case
xbxtkPxEpIE,9489120,9494761,i don't want the bottom of me to like  snag anything
xbxtkPxEpIE,9496160,9500641,okay i won't go too crazy on the power  this time
xbxtkPxEpIE,9502000,9508399,just enough to like get it moving fast  i say that but i do it anyway because i
xbxtkPxEpIE,9508399,9514960,see like a little bit of clearance ahead  of me and then i'm like yeah we can  power through
xbxtkPxEpIE,9515280,9520800,i'm so glad i didn't build up a super  boost  because i really wanted to and then
xbxtkPxEpIE,9520800,9523840,seeing that it would have done nothing
xbxtkPxEpIE,9543920,9548520,stuff to pick up but it sounds so far  away
xbxtkPxEpIE,9550800,9556000,oh is that a is that a crashy is that a  crashy
xbxtkPxEpIE,9557200,9564160,oh god  ow  ow  okay okay come back a bit come back a
xbxtkPxEpIE,9564160,9570479,bit  use whatever power you have to come back  a bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,9572240,9578279,okay hold on a sec i need to figure out  where i am and what i'm doing
xbxtkPxEpIE,9578319,9581439,no you're still going back
xbxtkPxEpIE,9589920,9594159,like is that a hole i can go into it  sure is

xbxtkPxEpIE,9610080,9612640,stay still
xbxtkPxEpIE,9615840,9622880,okay there you go  is there like an emergency break that  i'm missing i really feel like there is
xbxtkPxEpIE,9622880,9629279,but maybe the fact that i can go  backwards and forwards now  means that i'm not i don't know
xbxtkPxEpIE,9629600,9635439,wait this wasn't even anything  i can't go in there it really looked
xbxtkPxEpIE,9635439,9641680,like i could  what are you doing to me
xbxtkPxEpIE,9643120,9647800,oh there's a lot going on in that though  there's a ladder
xbxtkPxEpIE,9648160,9655760,oh man  wasting my time and my fuel and  everything  and worst of all i'm wasting your time
xbxtkPxEpIE,9655760,9661040,oh look at those pictures though  or statues
xbxtkPxEpIE,9661040,9667359,i can't even tell oh  i'm supposed to connect that to that
xbxtkPxEpIE,9667359,9675720,that was not  obvious at all unless they kind of like  line i mean it kind of lined it up but
xbxtkPxEpIE,9676800,9682640,whoa  [Music]

xbxtkPxEpIE,9736880,9740160,the lights are doing the lights
xbxtkPxEpIE,9745359,9752800,is this a part that i need  or do i swim down through this tiny hole  that just opened
xbxtkPxEpIE,9757359,9762960,okay  there's a puzzles to solve guys
xbxtkPxEpIE,9768640,9773760,it almost takes a while to like figure  out  exactly  where i am and what i'm supposed to be
xbxtkPxEpIE,9773760,9780800,doing with most of this stuff oh no hold  on  oh do i
xbxtkPxEpIE,9784640,9789560,do i get rid of it and get a better one
xbxtkPxEpIE,9796479,9802319,oh yeah you dispose of these ones over  here  then you go grab a new one maybe maybe
xbxtkPxEpIE,9802319,9808800,it'll like push them all across i don't  know  but there's a big button on the side of  that that clearly needs to be pushed to
xbxtkPxEpIE,9808800,9815760,do something  there you go
xbxtkPxEpIE,9815760,9818720,forgot i was swimming
xbxtkPxEpIE,9821279,9828399,nice i'm glad sometimes it just does  that where it  lets you just kind of
xbxtkPxEpIE,9828399,9834080,levitate into the right position  it still looks like i'm allowed to pick
xbxtkPxEpIE,9834080,9839760,it up though  but you can't show me this one with a
xbxtkPxEpIE,9839760,9843520,hook on it unless i can pick it up right
xbxtkPxEpIE,9849279,9851601,nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,9857120,9864800,then i put this in hit the button a big  giant turbine turns on and gives me  super powers
xbxtkPxEpIE,9866560,9874960,or you know just enough power to get out  of here  whoa okay that was a cool sound
xbxtkPxEpIE,9882720,9887000,what if it like drains all the water
xbxtkPxEpIE,9897840,9903360,sure  i i hope it did something because i have  no idea what's going on
xbxtkPxEpIE,9903360,9906600,[Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,9908800,9913560,do you think i can hook this with my  boat

xbxtkPxEpIE,9921439,9925080,what did that do
xbxtkPxEpIE,9928160,9932479,i thought these were like buttons that i  was supposed to be pushing
xbxtkPxEpIE,9935279,9941200,can't do that  you got to be clear and concise my  ship's bubbling a lot though and it gave
xbxtkPxEpIE,9941200,9946800,me fuel so  because it wants me to do something
xbxtkPxEpIE,9946800,9951278,oh we have three little bars on the side  of my oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,9953040,9958160,that's a lot of power i'm powering  something  you see there's three little bars next
xbxtkPxEpIE,9958160,9964960,to my super engine  maybe if i fill those
xbxtkPxEpIE,9968640,9974000,oh yeah that's supercharged i don't know  what we're doing
xbxtkPxEpIE,9977120,9981399,oh i'm giving energy back
xbxtkPxEpIE,9984319,9990160,ancient energy  [Music]  damn
xbxtkPxEpIE,9990160,9996399,[Music]  yeah now pump all of the water out of
xbxtkPxEpIE,9996399,10003520,this section  or like a huge amount of it  [Music]

xbxtkPxEpIE,10085439,10092240,what am i supposed to do you gonna give  me wheels  risen from the depths
xbxtkPxEpIE,10094640,10100080,all right let's see what this does  let's have this do nothing
xbxtkPxEpIE,10105359,10109960,maybe maybe i got a super engine again
xbxtkPxEpIE,10114560,10120080,i have no idea honestly  yeah i'm charging up something again
xbxtkPxEpIE,10122840,10128000,okay sure i mean if you want to go bro  i'll i'll go
xbxtkPxEpIE,10128000,10134800,i'm all about supercharged and stuff and  putting caution to the wind
xbxtkPxEpIE,10134800,10140399,i'm all about messing things up  and doing things wrong
xbxtkPxEpIE,10143760,10150920,that's a lot of energy though that my  little ship has in it now if it's able  to rise all of that
xbxtkPxEpIE,10155760,10160680,i feel like i'm powering the whole  planet right now
xbxtkPxEpIE,10171760,10176520,okay i wasn't actually supposed to do  that
xbxtkPxEpIE,10184160,10190080,i'm probably supposed to go outside and  like uh  clear a blockage
xbxtkPxEpIE,10190720,10194438,or something you know
xbxtkPxEpIE,10196720,10203120,huh  this game really confuses me sometimes

xbxtkPxEpIE,10322399,10327600,well i mean i'm happy you guys got your  power back  even though i don't think a damn person

xbxtkPxEpIE,10333200,10340000,what's the point of that  why did i help these people
xbxtkPxEpIE,10342240,10349840,am i just a cool person  well there's wind blowing so i'm just  going to take that as a sign that i  should put my sail up
xbxtkPxEpIE,10360080,10366160,yep  you're gonna scrape your entire boat
xbxtkPxEpIE,10366160,10373120,like that all the way down there  no i don't like that this is expensive
xbxtkPxEpIE,10373120,10378398,i paid good money for this  zero dollars
xbxtkPxEpIE,10381439,10387680,oh god  and we're back in the water where we
xbxtkPxEpIE,10387680,10393200,belong  now what
xbxtkPxEpIE,10393200,10399200,i thought i thought i reached  civilization  i thought i was with my people
xbxtkPxEpIE,10399520,10405318,even the achievement says what now  i don't know
xbxtkPxEpIE,10408080,10415040,just keep going and find out i guess  what's ahead of me
xbxtkPxEpIE,10416080,10421680,i used up a lot of good energy to power  this whole city for those people  am i just not going to get any thanks
xbxtkPxEpIE,10421680,10424080,for that
xbxtkPxEpIE,10428720,10434720,i mean i don't do things just for thanks  but sometimes it would be nice you know
xbxtkPxEpIE,10438000,10444840,time to just sail along i guess  oh never mind i'm solving a mystery
xbxtkPxEpIE,10444840,10451730,again hmm  pull out my notebook  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,10452000,10461240,where were you on the night of the 12th  seems like you don't have an alibi
xbxtkPxEpIE,10462040,10467439,[Music]  what is this giant place
xbxtkPxEpIE,10468640,10473880,my second sale doesn't know if it wants  to stay in or out
xbxtkPxEpIE,10474240,10479600,it's like when you're a child and your  mother's like are you injury out  you're letting the heat out crazy
xbxtkPxEpIE,10479600,10485359,looking place  [Music]  but that is the  when i saw the two cogs and i was like
xbxtkPxEpIE,10485359,10490640,oh do i have to put cogs in this that  was this place right  because it looked like oh whoops
xbxtkPxEpIE,10490640,10496080,it looked like it was out in the middle  of the ocean  [Music]  trying to keep hammering at this we'll
xbxtkPxEpIE,10496080,10501520,get past it it's not worth taking them  down just to put them back up again  it did look like it was all the way out
xbxtkPxEpIE,10501520,10506720,in the ocean and then one of the other  cities was on land  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,10506720,10511840,i don't know  maybe it's not even a city they just
xbxtkPxEpIE,10511840,10519600,kind of look like buildings like  apartment complexes with lights on in  them but i keep thinking  how would you get anywhere
xbxtkPxEpIE,10519600,10524960,are those pipes like a  transportation system
xbxtkPxEpIE,10525840,10532880,i don't know man there's a lot to this  game that's  like weird there's so much like above  and below water as well i keep thinking
xbxtkPxEpIE,10532880,10539601,that i'm  missing stuff  [Music]  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,10539760,10548000,what are we coming up against  [Music]  i'm going under one of those giant pipes
xbxtkPxEpIE,10554160,10561040,oh  no dang it  maybe if that goes up full
xbxtkPxEpIE,10561040,10566881,like if this thing goes up full the sail  just  goes down and gets damaged
xbxtkPxEpIE,10568080,10573841,i don't know but i'm on my way to open  ocean again  out of my way
xbxtkPxEpIE,10581840,10589920,yeah you're gonna bang into that now as  well  why can't you just be  nice i'm sailing away
xbxtkPxEpIE,10589920,10596880,and no go over your busy  [Music]  well it looks like it's about to get  cold
xbxtkPxEpIE,10598160,10606800,heading into the frozen tundras  i am a little wary about going
xbxtkPxEpIE,10606800,10610318,too crazy with this
xbxtkPxEpIE,10613279,10619120,but i do want to do a boosty i have a  feeling i'm just going to hit an iceberg  in two seconds
xbxtkPxEpIE,10619120,10623800,i'll hit this and it'll be useless to me
xbxtkPxEpIE,10628560,10632079,dang we're really sailing now
xbxtkPxEpIE,10636800,10644399,this game is also longer than i expected  i thought we would be done by now but  it's cool that it keeps going
xbxtkPxEpIE,10644399,10651920,oh iceberg  oh  yeah should i should i be underwater
xbxtkPxEpIE,10651920,10658399,why not  that's down there you know  okay icebergs if you're below the
xbxtkPxEpIE,10658399,10665040,icebergs  even though they notoriously uh go  deeper than people think
xbxtkPxEpIE,10665040,10672560,oh oops hit myself i forgot to pull them  down  i am just the worst captain of this ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,10675920,10679438,what is that it's happening again
xbxtkPxEpIE,10682960,10690398,oh oh oh go down go down go down  go down  iceberg ahead
xbxtkPxEpIE,10690640,10696960,oh  god oh this is all wait hold on hold on  hold on hold on stop stop
xbxtkPxEpIE,10696960,10703840,go back go back we actually have to go  back  we have to go back can you go back at
xbxtkPxEpIE,10703840,10708318,all oh probably this thing is actually  preventing that
xbxtkPxEpIE,10710880,10716960,i just i just need to slot that in there  oh  man
xbxtkPxEpIE,10716960,10724801,i probably have to go up a tiny bit  the little bit of fuel i had
xbxtkPxEpIE,10725200,10730960,okay let's let's fill up this  let's fill up this tank
xbxtkPxEpIE,10732720,10738239,can i i want to see if i can use that  light it's absolutely useless to me
xbxtkPxEpIE,10739680,10744720,okay let's let's bring you up  just a smidge
xbxtkPxEpIE,10744720,10750720,just like that yeah oh oh it's  levitating into place  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,10750720,10758160,no it's not it's going the wrong way  yeah okay now you're kind of lined up  and i'll just go down onto that
xbxtkPxEpIE,10758160,10764319,nice  now that i know how to do that it was so  confusing the first time
xbxtkPxEpIE,10764840,10769840,[Music]  okay what's down here
xbxtkPxEpIE,10772240,10779279,sure oh my god am i going into like an  under  underground underwater base
xbxtkPxEpIE,10780720,10787120,oh oh  i goofed it  i broke the handle what am i supposed to
xbxtkPxEpIE,10787120,10792850,do now  maybe there's a thing down here that can  fix it
xbxtkPxEpIE,10792850,10798560,[Music]  okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,10798560,10805600,oh yeah there is up there we have  ourselves  a bit of a puzzle
xbxtkPxEpIE,10805600,10811439,fill these with water  oh the weight of it is actually going to
xbxtkPxEpIE,10811439,10816399,balance out this  gotcha gotcha gotcha
xbxtkPxEpIE,10816800,10820080,okay we need a little bit more
xbxtkPxEpIE,10821920,10827680,i can't like go too far with it can i  no because then the game would break
xbxtkPxEpIE,10827680,10833840,everything and that would be awful  okay okay i just need that to connect on
xbxtkPxEpIE,10833840,10840640,the left over there  so how about we bring you a little  further
xbxtkPxEpIE,10840640,10845840,yo science  physics
xbxtkPxEpIE,10847840,10851560,that seems about right
xbxtkPxEpIE,10855200,10861680,again i just be pressing things  these could do  anything
xbxtkPxEpIE,10864960,10870319,is that seismograph  it's like recording the earthquakes that
xbxtkPxEpIE,10870319,10872801,are happening
xbxtkPxEpIE,10876399,10883120,did i do all of that just to get this  there's no way
xbxtkPxEpIE,10883920,10890080,maybe it'll stay locked in place now  actually  oh my god this is so slow
xbxtkPxEpIE,10890080,10897040,okay pull that pull the water out of  this thing again because i don't need it  to actually weigh anything down i just  needed to get across
xbxtkPxEpIE,10899840,10904880,yeah the thing would be moving by now if  the balance was wrong again
xbxtkPxEpIE,10905200,10912000,okay can i push this faster now oh  that's not that much faster
xbxtkPxEpIE,10913200,10919040,i was hoping to become speed  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,10921840,10929520,nice away i go  thank you i'm stealing  okay so i did something up top as well
xbxtkPxEpIE,10932640,10937841,i can't like go further down can i cause  it seems like there's something else  down there
xbxtkPxEpIE,10938479,10943278,the answer was no by the way i tried  didn't work
xbxtkPxEpIE,10944160,10949680,whoa  what's going on now
xbxtkPxEpIE,10949680,10956160,oh  terrible terrible terrible  bad things are happening to good people
xbxtkPxEpIE,10956160,10965398,right now oh  god  my ship marine where's it going
xbxtkPxEpIE,10966479,10972960,ah hello  oh lordy i do have to go down here oh  and i can't get that thing again oh this
xbxtkPxEpIE,10972960,10979640,is terrible  where did that go
xbxtkPxEpIE,10981279,10989880,there's no time  there's no time to figure these things  out  i'm so cute though
xbxtkPxEpIE,10995120,10997840,okay nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,11005120,11012239,okay are you are you here  it's like losing a part of yourself
xbxtkPxEpIE,11012640,11018160,nowhere to be seen  this is just like the first game where i
xbxtkPxEpIE,11018160,11024319,ran aground on my wheels and stuff broke  off  the northwest passage
xbxtkPxEpIE,11024319,11028240,oh my god don't make me walk on ice
xbxtkPxEpIE,11031680,11039438,what if the polar bears get me  this is freezing
xbxtkPxEpIE,11041760,11046800,oh my god this is the worst
xbxtkPxEpIE,11047680,11054640,this is the fastest i can go by the way  oh hold on we're picking up speed  yeah the more we run the more body heat
xbxtkPxEpIE,11054640,11060000,we have the more force we generate  let's go
xbxtkPxEpIE,11060560,11064318,but where is my ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,11065600,11073398,that can't be the last time i've seen it  i will be  violently upset
xbxtkPxEpIE,11080800,11086000,there's just nothing  there's nothing anywhere
xbxtkPxEpIE,11086000,11091240,also i don't know how you're not dying  in that  water isn't it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11091240,11094721,absolutely freezing
xbxtkPxEpIE,11099920,11102920,okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,11105279,11110560,so desolate  i mean  i imagine that's what the actual
xbxtkPxEpIE,11110560,11116840,antarctic is like  [Music]  [Applause]  look at me
xbxtkPxEpIE,11116840,11122398,go oh  building  civilization
xbxtkPxEpIE,11123920,11130479,oh the civilization doesn't mean much in  this game  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,11130479,11134318,i miss ship i miss bessie
xbxtkPxEpIE,11135840,11140880,let me zoom out now let's really give me  a better picture
xbxtkPxEpIE,11143600,11147840,it's kind of like pointing me forward  anyway regardless
xbxtkPxEpIE,11149439,11151761,oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,11156560,11162479,either that's another like boat that's  surfaced up but it looks like trains it  is trains actually turned into like a
xbxtkPxEpIE,11162479,11167840,boat  the way mine is like a silo turned into  one but maybe these are like
xbxtkPxEpIE,11167840,11174840,snow versions like they go across the  top of the ice but it looks like it  broke up through it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11174880,11178080,lots of boats and stuff here
xbxtkPxEpIE,11180080,11188050,this is just a ship graveyard  oh i better not see mine among them what  if mine is like come up through the ice
xbxtkPxEpIE,11188050,11194960,[Music]  there's gonna be so much to fix on it  when i find it again
xbxtkPxEpIE,11195680,11201049,damn these are big ones  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,11201359,11208000,oh we're going in  oh maybe i get to control this one again  it was my favorite part of the last game
xbxtkPxEpIE,11208000,11213120,that's when i got to do the big machine  but i guess  they probably don't want to retread
xbxtkPxEpIE,11213120,11219200,their steps  having said that a lot of this is  retreading some of the stuff from the  first game like you have the storms and
xbxtkPxEpIE,11219200,11225200,then you have the ice area  there's nothing wrong with that  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,11225200,11230438,there's something comfortable about the  familiar sometimes
xbxtkPxEpIE,11236479,11242800,okay i'm just going to go out on the  limb here and say that this thing  doesn't work anymore
xbxtkPxEpIE,11242800,11248800,it seems very disheveled and broken and  there's a whole train going down through  the middle of it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11249760,11256479,my ship has to be close  definitely has to be close you're giving  me a thing to fix stuff
xbxtkPxEpIE,11256479,11265039,that means my ship is going to be up  here  it's going to be burst up through the  ice at the edge of like a an ice shelf
xbxtkPxEpIE,11267439,11275920,i don't have to give her tender loving  kisses to get her back and work in order  can i make this oh yes
xbxtkPxEpIE,11278560,11283200,or you're just gonna make me fix this  this isn't my boat
xbxtkPxEpIE,11284960,11290640,this is just a stupid boat for stupid  people  where's my
xbxtkPxEpIE,11290640,11296398,much better  eloquent for sophisticated people ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,11297279,11301399,it's a boat and a house in one
xbxtkPxEpIE,11308640,11314560,we must be getting close to the end as  well  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,11314560,11322460,oh no  what  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,11322640,11329561,what  what am i supposed to do about that huh
xbxtkPxEpIE,11329760,11335200,okay the wind is gone sprint sprint like  your ship depended on it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11335200,11339840,because it does i don't even think i  should be bringing this thing with me
xbxtkPxEpIE,11341359,11346960,oh yes yes shelter  okay there's nothing to hold on to this  time so i'm just gonna assume that
xbxtkPxEpIE,11346960,11353840,you're not gonna blow away  like my hopes and dreams  and my ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,11353840,11359439,just got carried off in a current  pretty home to a bunch of turtles right
xbxtkPxEpIE,11359439,11366319,now  and
xbxtkPxEpIE,11366319,11371520,go  it's kind of hard to determine when the  wind is actually dying down because it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11371520,11377359,just sounds windy all the time  these little white streaks are always  going across the screen
xbxtkPxEpIE,11377359,11385600,i think i missed my window  no make it make it oh my god i was so
xbxtkPxEpIE,11385600,11391520,close  ah it's so annoying
xbxtkPxEpIE,11392000,11397239,you can't have the white streaks go  across the screen constantly
xbxtkPxEpIE,11398479,11405200,there we go  because like the wind has stopped now  but it still looks like i mean now it  doesn't but oh my god go
xbxtkPxEpIE,11405200,11413640,screw that thing  every tiny little human for themselves
xbxtkPxEpIE,11414720,11422840,okay thank god  now i just keep holding forward whenever  i can go i can go
xbxtkPxEpIE,11428239,11435640,i have some fixer-upper things on my  ship anyway if i really need them
xbxtkPxEpIE,11441920,11449199,okay oh  my boat has to be down here come on  show me the money
xbxtkPxEpIE,11450319,11455319,oh sorry whoops whoops my bad my bad
xbxtkPxEpIE,11456160,11462960,that's not it  you're not boat
xbxtkPxEpIE,11463520,11469279,you do look cool though  it's okay i'm gonna put fuel in here and
xbxtkPxEpIE,11469279,11476000,we're gonna go a little bit  wow
xbxtkPxEpIE,11476880,11483319,hello  are you dead
xbxtkPxEpIE,11483520,11489521,that was the lady in the picture she had  the flower in her hand right or the  plant
xbxtkPxEpIE,11490319,11498399,that or you just  [Music]  maybe everyone in that society
xbxtkPxEpIE,11498399,11503760,looks similar  or i've been looking for you and now i  just found out that you're dead oh my
xbxtkPxEpIE,11503760,11507800,god it's that isn't it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11511840,11518800,that's sad  wait i should bring the fuel with me uh  oh hold on hold on
xbxtkPxEpIE,11518800,11524960,hold on don't go without me  please don't go without me that would be  awful
xbxtkPxEpIE,11524960,11532080,i would be very upset  maybe it's actually just melting the ice
xbxtkPxEpIE,11537600,11545200,i wonder who she was to me  it is just melting the ice  okay let's get full steam
xbxtkPxEpIE,11548080,11555760,full red hot engine  the only time when overheating is  actually going to be necessary
xbxtkPxEpIE,11559200,11564319,is it melting  oh yeah it is it's shrinking
xbxtkPxEpIE,11564319,11570160,look at it go  sorry you're dead by the way
xbxtkPxEpIE,11572239,11577439,real shame  would have been nice to have a friend
xbxtkPxEpIE,11578319,11584560,i guess that's sort of the theme with  these games though isn't it that  society is like fractured and gone and
xbxtkPxEpIE,11584560,11588398,there's nobody else around
xbxtkPxEpIE,11593279,11598560,but dude don't worry somewhere out there  in this universe there's another guy
xbxtkPxEpIE,11598560,11603760,with another thing on land  and he's stuck at the edge of the water
xbxtkPxEpIE,11603760,11611680,hoping for a friend as well  you guys can hang out at some point
xbxtkPxEpIE,11611840,11615600,why isn't this allowing me there you go
xbxtkPxEpIE,11617279,11623160,this is probably enough just to get  through but i want to see how much i can  melt it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11624960,11631760,eh  that'll do it's like the first time this  thing has seen heat in a million years
xbxtkPxEpIE,11633040,11639920,i was kind of hoping we could drive it  though it has like a car cab in it  i love that i love that how did you run
xbxtkPxEpIE,11639920,11647279,across that  i love that all the machinery and  everything is kind of built out of other  parts of other things
xbxtkPxEpIE,11648160,11651720,such a fun idea
xbxtkPxEpIE,11653760,11657479,i'm coming ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,11664720,11670880,whoa  is that a waterfall over there is it  just ice
xbxtkPxEpIE,11670880,11676399,like mist coming down the side it's  probably that but it looks like a  waterfall from here
xbxtkPxEpIE,11676840,11682801,we my ankles are broken but that's okay  i'm surrounded by ice no swelling
xbxtkPxEpIE,11690160,11695200,i'm glad they don't lean into the i  might be speaking too soon but i'm glad  they don't lean into the like slow
xbxtkPxEpIE,11695200,11700720,walking like oh i'm getting tired kind  of stuff a lot of games do that
xbxtkPxEpIE,11701120,11710160,is it happening  am i gonna get an epiphany in two  seconds  come on show it to me baby show it to me

xbxtkPxEpIE,11724720,11730800,how did this happen  who did this to you  technically i did
xbxtkPxEpIE,11730800,11737039,we're not going to talk about that like  that  we just forgive and love each other
xbxtkPxEpIE,11741680,11746840,nice  all fixed up  everything fixed up everything good to
xbxtkPxEpIE,11746840,11752399,go start that engine baby  we have a lot of heating to do oh  there's a fixy thing in the front as
xbxtkPxEpIE,11752399,11758560,well but  nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,11758560,11764560,nice why are you aiming backwards that's  not good let's aim you forwards in case  we actually start moving suddenly and
xbxtkPxEpIE,11764560,11770239,rapidly  um i should go back and get the rest of  this fuel shouldn't i
xbxtkPxEpIE,11774479,11781439,shouldn't i  can i can i still go
xbxtkPxEpIE,11781600,11788160,can i  i shouldn't have done that i shouldn't  have done that this is a terrible  mistake
xbxtkPxEpIE,11788160,11794399,i'm sorry i'm sorry don't leave without  me don't go too far  crap the camera won't go any further
xbxtkPxEpIE,11794399,11800239,okay that's fine that's fine something  else is happening  you're being dislodged
xbxtkPxEpIE,11801359,11807520,okay i got one of them  i don't want it to leave without me that
xbxtkPxEpIE,11807520,11815439,would be awful  climb  is the engine cam down now
xbxtkPxEpIE,11815520,11821840,yeah okay i think we're fine i need to  fix the sail as well we have one tiny  extra piece to break oh god
xbxtkPxEpIE,11821840,11827840,i lost you and then i immediately was  like i'm gonna go back here and abandon  you for five seconds
xbxtkPxEpIE,11830840,11836000,oh  that's rough sounding  you know what
xbxtkPxEpIE,11836000,11842720,i can't be irished  are you okay you're just dislodging on  your own
xbxtkPxEpIE,11842720,11849760,i don't like that  united  and it feels so good
xbxtkPxEpIE,11852960,11858239,okay everybody in  did i
xbxtkPxEpIE,11858239,11862721,okay there it is i thought i lost it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11863680,11870880,okay nice  uh start up the engine  let's get her moving
xbxtkPxEpIE,11872840,11880399,yeah it's like nothing even happened to  you  just as good as ever
xbxtkPxEpIE,11884399,11889520,and fixed nice  running a tight ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,11889520,11896080,you bet i am  can i uh can i
xbxtkPxEpIE,11896080,11901318,oh i thought i wasn't able to climb my  own ship there for a second
xbxtkPxEpIE,11903359,11907200,get some of this action going
xbxtkPxEpIE,11908479,11916601,excellent excellent are we fully geared  up for a boost yet i think we were and i  missed it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11916960,11921358,here we go  here we go
xbxtkPxEpIE,11922399,11925279,it's gonna happen
xbxtkPxEpIE,11929439,11934880,is it gonna happen  am i missing it  it's gonna happen
xbxtkPxEpIE,11935760,11943800,nice because when that happens the  engine heat  stabilizes and goes down a little bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,11945600,11953358,nice  the power of industry yeah see that's  that's waterfalls isn't it
xbxtkPxEpIE,11954239,11959319,it's kind of bizarre to look at but it's  it's there
xbxtkPxEpIE,11959520,11967560,keep that going baby  keep that going but don't overheat cool  yourself down there hotshot
xbxtkPxEpIE,11973840,11979760,i wonder if i should be under the water  for this oh i'm catching wind perfectly  no need to adjust
xbxtkPxEpIE,11979760,11985439,we're doing great  everything is running like a well-oiled
xbxtkPxEpIE,11985439,11992640,machine right now  if i do toot my own horn myself
xbxtkPxEpIE,11992800,11996479,come on before the bar goes back
xbxtkPxEpIE,12002239,12007359,anything going on below the surface  no
xbxtkPxEpIE,12008560,12013160,the waters are getting a little choppier  though
xbxtkPxEpIE,12017920,12023920,oh the water is getting very choppy oh  lord  i don't have any sea legs i barely have
xbxtkPxEpIE,12023920,12027319,regular legs
xbxtkPxEpIE,12029840,12034318,i fall over  all the time
xbxtkPxEpIE,12038319,12043359,okay let's be careful now for a second  because i'm seeing rocks
xbxtkPxEpIE,12043359,12049600,i'm seeing rocks and i don't like it  should i take down my sails  are you gonna smack
xbxtkPxEpIE,12053040,12058960,oh  oh out of my way i have places to be and  things to do when i'm cool and better
xbxtkPxEpIE,12058960,12065279,than you  i'm talking to a buoy
xbxtkPxEpIE,12065359,12073278,okay okay  you need to go down  oh  the whole thing needs to go down
xbxtkPxEpIE,12079760,12084920,at least i imagine so because where else  are we gonna go
xbxtkPxEpIE,12085120,12091680,okay go back a little bit  there you go i'm glad you're able to  reverse in this one
xbxtkPxEpIE,12091680,12099721,you actually have to guide your ship  left and right as well  oh there's stuff back here though so i  should go that way
xbxtkPxEpIE,12101279,12107279,okay that fuels about to die out any  second  yes
xbxtkPxEpIE,12109120,12115439,okay that's enough for  now i can get out here and do my hook  thing
xbxtkPxEpIE,12119279,12126200,be nice if you just hooked on on your  own though it did  and i took it off
xbxtkPxEpIE,12131200,12136960,can it re-hook on its own  hey  nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,12136960,12143120,what do we get  oh a big one  excellent because we're we just ran out
xbxtkPxEpIE,12143120,12150160,so  you can go in there  it says there's something else further  back
xbxtkPxEpIE,12152640,12158640,it's not something on my ship already is  it  i don't think so
xbxtkPxEpIE,12158640,12161278,what is it
xbxtkPxEpIE,12166720,12170238,can't be this far back can it
xbxtkPxEpIE,12173920,12181239,the heck is my ship even pointing to the  sonar was detecting something or i can  see through the ground
xbxtkPxEpIE,12183520,12191520,not worth it  unless i have to go  back there i don't think so i think i  just keep moving forward
xbxtkPxEpIE,12192560,12199680,that would kind of be ridiculous if you  were able to go this far forward and  then the game was like actually you need  to go  way back that direction because
xbxtkPxEpIE,12199680,12206319,the engine is the only way you can  actually move forward and back the sails  you can't
xbxtkPxEpIE,12206960,12213278,you can't really pick to go backwards  with them  unless
xbxtkPxEpIE,12213680,12220319,uh and i'll bring you down here  i don't have that much stuff left for
xbxtkPxEpIE,12220319,12225840,fuel but i have a couple of big ones so  that's  nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,12226880,12234920,just make sure you're all stacked up so  i don't have to come down here and do  this later  i'm an efficient little man
xbxtkPxEpIE,12239600,12244399,okay  let's put you forward a little bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,12248239,12253359,let's just give you a tiny taste because  you might be stuck
xbxtkPxEpIE,12253359,12256479,you're a wee bit stuck
xbxtkPxEpIE,12260560,12266000,now i need to do this  before i smash into everything okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,12266000,12272479,let's not  let's hold on let's hold our horses here  for a second
xbxtkPxEpIE,12272479,12276238,there you go perfect
xbxtkPxEpIE,12278960,12286800,is that good  that's good  okay too far down
xbxtkPxEpIE,12288640,12294160,i guess i could just do that every time  is keep it in it but i keep pulling it  out to get away from it as fast as
xbxtkPxEpIE,12294160,12298561,possible  like stop whatever's happening
xbxtkPxEpIE,12306479,12314000,okay let's go down further oh lord that  was too quick  i got too eager
xbxtkPxEpIE,12320399,12325120,there's something there but we're just  still moving
xbxtkPxEpIE,12327359,12332560,ah whatever i probably could have gotten  out and gotten it but
xbxtkPxEpIE,12332560,12340561,unless the fuel dies like right now  you know what i'll do it i'll do it
xbxtkPxEpIE,12340640,12344319,let's pull her back to neutral for a  second
xbxtkPxEpIE,12347040,12353120,because i i might regret not having it  later  oh we went further away from it than i
xbxtkPxEpIE,12353120,12360399,thought we did  i'm so boosty
xbxtkPxEpIE,12363040,12367521,all right there's another one  ahead
xbxtkPxEpIE,12368239,12371601,let's see if i can get that before i
xbxtkPxEpIE,12376560,12384000,okay we're actually going oh  okay that's good to know actually that  we're going back up soon
xbxtkPxEpIE,12384319,12387279,all right let's just do it
xbxtkPxEpIE,12390160,12393800,no need to be worried
xbxtkPxEpIE,12397920,12400960,okay in you go
xbxtkPxEpIE,12404000,12407000,nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,12411279,12418319,nice  and then we raise you a tiny bit  not fully yet
xbxtkPxEpIE,12418319,12423600,and then a tiny bit  not fully yet
xbxtkPxEpIE,12423600,12428160,nice  getting pretty efficient
xbxtkPxEpIE,12429120,12435841,there's room to grow  but i'm happy with our progress so far
xbxtkPxEpIE,12440000,12443760,might have to go back down here actually
xbxtkPxEpIE,12447600,12453920,give it a bit of a kick  let's go back down
xbxtkPxEpIE,12457600,12463279,because it is pointing out oh god what  is that  what is that okay stop stop stop stop
xbxtkPxEpIE,12463279,12465761,everything stop
xbxtkPxEpIE,12469279,12477840,is that something that i have to  grab with the hook on my ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,12481120,12489960,whoa what is that  it's like a bomb  but there's stuff way below me as well
xbxtkPxEpIE,12491120,12494000,let's see what i can do
xbxtkPxEpIE,12496640,12504040,oh we're gonna have to go back a little  bit though aren't we  uh hopefully the game can just correct  itself
xbxtkPxEpIE,12504239,12509920,that's bad  oh cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,12509920,12515199,jesus  look i just don't want to waste fuel
xbxtkPxEpIE,12517600,12521600,like i want to go forward like a smidge
xbxtkPxEpIE,12530239,12534398,i probably don't have to use my ship at  all do i
xbxtkPxEpIE,12536560,12540721,okay now pull her back pull her back to  center
xbxtkPxEpIE,12545040,12551040,see like that because i'm like burning  fuel but then i do i just quench the  fire
xbxtkPxEpIE,12552160,12559600,i'm always uncertain as of what to do  god that goes down quick
xbxtkPxEpIE,12559600,12566239,will you hold that  does this even work
xbxtkPxEpIE,12566239,12570398,yes it does  yes indeedy
xbxtkPxEpIE,12571439,12577840,okay so it seems like this thing swings  so maybe you have to pull it back and  then let it go
xbxtkPxEpIE,12580319,12585080,oh wait no it's just pulling off the  front oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,12589439,12592000,what did i do
xbxtkPxEpIE,12595120,12602601,okay bye  did i just wreck their whole ship
xbxtkPxEpIE,12603200,12606561,i'm sorry to whoever owns that
xbxtkPxEpIE,12612800,12619680,i have no idea what i did with that  maybe there's something
xbxtkPxEpIE,12619680,12623358,at the bottom now where it crashed
xbxtkPxEpIE,12626720,12632880,that right just  i did it for kicks  yeah super fun yeah i just love wrecking
xbxtkPxEpIE,12632880,12640080,stuff  all right we have to go back a tiny bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,12641279,12645561,because i'm going to catch in that piece
xbxtkPxEpIE,12647600,12653279,yep yep yep  then stop her there
xbxtkPxEpIE,12653279,12657080,and then let's sink
xbxtkPxEpIE,12658880,12667160,okay not so bad  not so bad i'm not even worried anymore
xbxtkPxEpIE,12672560,12677439,maybe move forward a little because i  imagine i have to move forward anyway
xbxtkPxEpIE,12679279,12683561,it just crashed at the bottom now
xbxtkPxEpIE,12686720,12690318,was there a reason for any of this
xbxtkPxEpIE,12692399,12696439,am i just a terrible person
xbxtkPxEpIE,12703279,12709120,at least i get these  i think i could have gotten those anyway  but
xbxtkPxEpIE,12709120,12712120,whatever
xbxtkPxEpIE,12714960,12722160,nice  i keep forgetting that there's some  stuff there as well  that i could probably use later if i  wanted to
xbxtkPxEpIE,12724000,12731439,what is this  like some sort of trophy or plaque
xbxtkPxEpIE,12735760,12742521,can i burn it  oh my god
xbxtkPxEpIE,12742560,12748398,probably was for like display purposes  and i'm just burning everything i own
xbxtkPxEpIE,12749040,12756399,oh well  no need to be that materialistic  okay maybe we actually just surface
xbxtkPxEpIE,12756399,12763439,i'm so lost  because the breath of this game is so  much bigger than the original the
xbxtkPxEpIE,12763439,12770080,original was like go left or right  that's kind of your whole  your whole thing but this one's like up
xbxtkPxEpIE,12770080,12777040,right left down where do you want to go  there's a plethora of places that you  can be
xbxtkPxEpIE,12782479,12790640,i choose up please  also need to go back i think  as i pushed forward a tiny bit again
xbxtkPxEpIE,12790640,12795920,yep yep yep yep yep yep go back go back
xbxtkPxEpIE,12795920,12800960,go back yeah  yeah i  i ruined it again
xbxtkPxEpIE,12800960,12804000,and i go forward a little
xbxtkPxEpIE,12810000,12813840,oh it's a hot air balloon
xbxtkPxEpIE,12818080,12823680,hold on  am i
xbxtkPxEpIE,12823680,12828319,am i supposed to inflate that there we  go
xbxtkPxEpIE,12832239,12834960,is that oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,12837840,12840840,dude
xbxtkPxEpIE,12844720,12847438,that's cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,12850800,12857920,oh oh we're okay  okay  okay we're not smacking anything
xbxtkPxEpIE,12857920,12866761,damn  i did not expect that
xbxtkPxEpIE,12868640,12873840,whoa  okay
xbxtkPxEpIE,12873840,12880080,never mind going to the third game we're  already sky-bound  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,12880080,12887040,that's so pretty  aeronaut
xbxtkPxEpIE,12888319,12895880,oh  oh don't tilt me too far  um
xbxtkPxEpIE,12896319,12901380,damn i didn't realize it was like a  shelf with an ocean on top of it  basically
xbxtkPxEpIE,12901380,12911200,[Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,12911200,12917040,wow we're so high up above everything  now  that's all going to come crashing down i
xbxtkPxEpIE,12917040,12923960,have a feeling this whole thing is just  going to break and my ship's going to  fall right back into the ocean
xbxtkPxEpIE,12926960,12931920,hey or not maybe we actually just  control this thing from now on
xbxtkPxEpIE,12933439,12938761,which would be really cool  oh boosty
xbxtkPxEpIE,12939680,12944000,i don't know what that does when you're  airborne
xbxtkPxEpIE,12945279,12951120,but i'll try it  milo put up my sails will the sails like
xbxtkPxEpIE,12951120,12958641,carry me further  oh wait  the hook is on that thing now
xbxtkPxEpIE,12961439,12967120,sales going up  on a tuesday
xbxtkPxEpIE,12967120,12971680,can i hook it to this  oh never mind
xbxtkPxEpIE,12972720,12978760,i i don't really know why that has a  hook  honestly
xbxtkPxEpIE,12981840,12989439,i guess it just had a hook from when i  moved it the first time  when i took the other chunk of the
xbxtkPxEpIE,12989439,12995840,thing out  nice
xbxtkPxEpIE,12996160,13002960,dude look at us go  it's so awesome
xbxtkPxEpIE,13002960,13006600,oh ran out of fuel
xbxtkPxEpIE,13014000,13019318,i guess i can still build the energy for  whenever i need it later
xbxtkPxEpIE,13022880,13031358,right now it's not really necessary  because my engine isn't doing a whole  lot other than  keeping the balloon up
xbxtkPxEpIE,13033520,13036520,dang
xbxtkPxEpIE,13039600,13048040,i didn't expect us to get into that  territory in this game  like being in a balloon
xbxtkPxEpIE,13051680,13056800,oh are we going down  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,13056800,13061920,wait this is land  oh oh wait no
xbxtkPxEpIE,13072080,13079840,well that's just convenient isn't it  oh no  oh we're being slit out

xbxtkPxEpIE,13180399,13186640,not a whole lot i can do about that well  again at least i don't have anything to  repair my ship with all the time like on
xbxtkPxEpIE,13186640,13191680,board  like i did in the previous game so this  time they kind of i think they're a bit
xbxtkPxEpIE,13191680,13198880,more forgiving about  what what a toss they're more forgiving  about smashing into things
xbxtkPxEpIE,13203279,13208560,okay gotta put oh the fuel that was down  there i was supposed to bring here and
xbxtkPxEpIE,13208560,13215199,put into it  okay there's more hey  that's heron or a stork or whatever it
xbxtkPxEpIE,13215199,13221120,is  uh

xbxtkPxEpIE,13228399,13235040,ancient energy  a hot air balloon in the background
xbxtkPxEpIE,13235199,13240600,oh  whoopsies
xbxtkPxEpIE,13247040,13253199,it's not doing anything  oh do i need more
xbxtkPxEpIE,13253199,13255840,more power
xbxtkPxEpIE,13259680,13265600,hold on let me go back and get that box  god damn it  i thought that box was for me for down
xbxtkPxEpIE,13265600,13271279,here i didn't realize i had to bring it  up i probably should have realized  and checked the place out first and then
xbxtkPxEpIE,13271279,13279120,got the box and brought it with me on  the way back  that would have been smarter but we  gotta turn on the lighthouse
xbxtkPxEpIE,13280000,13285600,william to phone robert pattinson will  show up you're fun to me lobster aren't  you
xbxtkPxEpIE,13285600,13291439,there you go  now surely it'll do something right
xbxtkPxEpIE,13291439,13297520,because i couldn't get into the light  part  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13297520,13303398,there you go  oh that is the light
xbxtkPxEpIE,13304479,13310670,whoa  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13316160,13326239,is this gonna lift the whole thing  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13326239,13332600,that's cool we're following the light  across  there's a tiny fire
xbxtkPxEpIE,13332600,13338640,[Music]  that's what i did at the end of the  first game  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13338640,13344000,i lit a beacon so someone could come  find me  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13344000,13350960,is what's happening and now we're right  to left  i called it
xbxtkPxEpIE,13351840,13358160,i said that right at the start of the  game that we were going to find the  person from the end of the first game
xbxtkPxEpIE,13358160,13361920,i'm wrong and i'm actually just being  foolish right now
xbxtkPxEpIE,13363440,13369600,[Music]  that's the horn i heard at the end of
xbxtkPxEpIE,13369600,13375680,the first game  oh that's cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,13378640,13384720,oh whoa  i'm coming buddy you're not alone we do
xbxtkPxEpIE,13384720,13387840,have each other
xbxtkPxEpIE,13390479,13395520,because at the end of the first game you  sat and you lit the fire and your thing  was destroyed
xbxtkPxEpIE,13395520,13402000,and then  you kind of just waited and then the  screen faded to black and then you heard
xbxtkPxEpIE,13402000,13407600,that  so now you actually get to see what
xbxtkPxEpIE,13407600,13414600,is happening from that  oh it's so cool
xbxtkPxEpIE,13418319,13424319,like even though i called it at the  start and  multiple times since then but
xbxtkPxEpIE,13424319,13429840,seeing it actually play out is cool as  well and seeing the perspective shift
xbxtkPxEpIE,13430720,13437120,like left to right and now going right  to left because i was like wait it  doesn't make any sense  if the ship comes in from the right to
xbxtkPxEpIE,13437120,13440439,save us
xbxtkPxEpIE,13444800,13451439,can you catch more air  where's the air blowing from  nope
xbxtkPxEpIE,13452479,13457840,there you go  full sails
xbxtkPxEpIE,13460080,13464399,wait let me stand in the front because  we'll get a better vantage point
xbxtkPxEpIE,13469199,13474239,yeah because we ended the first game in  the snow area  so that would actually make sense then
xbxtkPxEpIE,13474239,13482560,that  we ended this game in the exact same  area not just a repeat of the first game
xbxtkPxEpIE,13482560,13490239,but actually the exact same place  wait we're slowing down
xbxtkPxEpIE,13497120,13505260,is it supposed to be going this slow  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13507680,13511398,catch more of that wind
xbxtkPxEpIE,13516319,13524239,i want to see him i want to see a little  fireman  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13530800,13537120,that's a cool reveal as well that as the  lighthouse turned around you could  actually just see the fire in the  distance go by
xbxtkPxEpIE,13537120,13543279,and then your brain connects it and then  or it's like wait is that the same as  the first time and then you hear that
xbxtkPxEpIE,13543279,13547438,horn and it's like  eureka
xbxtkPxEpIE,13552560,13559040,oh getting close to land  [Music]  okay we can't see more if we do that
xbxtkPxEpIE,13559040,13564160,this kind of like  i dropped the controller
xbxtkPxEpIE,13564560,13571040,this angles the land a bit better or  angles the camera to the land a bit  better
xbxtkPxEpIE,13575600,13581680,i mean if this is the end i can like  start up the engine and go find them  wait we're
xbxtkPxEpIE,13581680,13584720,that saving mean we're close
xbxtkPxEpIE,13589330,13594438,[Music]  because i don't want to miss it
xbxtkPxEpIE,13598720,13604399,[Music]  oh it's so weird to have everything  backwards
xbxtkPxEpIE,13604399,13610160,oh i don't have any things in the engine  anyway  it burn you
xbxtkPxEpIE,13610160,13616000,sure can  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,13616000,13623439,the wrangled control away from me  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13623439,13630800,show them to me yeah  [Music]  that's so fun
xbxtkPxEpIE,13630800,13637880,i'm here bud  climb aboard
xbxtkPxEpIE,13639760,13642760,friends
xbxtkPxEpIE,13653840,13656560,what an ending
xbxtkPxEpIE,13661520,13666640,you want to come on my ship  we don't really have anywhere to go
xbxtkPxEpIE,13666640,13672640,except back to where i came from  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13672640,13676080,but hey at least we'll be together
xbxtkPxEpIE,13677760,13682399,this one is so much bigger than the  previous one too
xbxtkPxEpIE,13684239,13687239,wow
xbxtkPxEpIE,13689380,13696880,[Music]  are you impressed
xbxtkPxEpIE,13696880,13702828,this is a sale  [Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13707199,13711600,love that i love seeing the symmetry  between them
xbxtkPxEpIE,13713930,13720720,[Music]
xbxtkPxEpIE,13720720,13729520,nice  hell yeah  man what a beautiful experience
xbxtkPxEpIE,13732730,13740080,[Music]  music's always so good thank you for  playing thank you for making it
xbxtkPxEpIE,13740399,13746160,oh he did climb aboard yay  locomotive
xbxtkPxEpIE,13747920,13753600,damn that was really fun  i had a a really good time with that
xbxtkPxEpIE,13753600,13758720,they changed just enough in the game to  make it still feel like fresh and new  and there was new things to do and new
xbxtkPxEpIE,13758720,13765120,things to handle but also was familiar  enough that you still got the same sort  of experience out of it
xbxtkPxEpIE,13765120,13771040,because sometimes sequels change a bit  too much about the game and it's like i  don't really vibe with this
xbxtkPxEpIE,13771040,13776880,but this kind of changed things all in  the right direction  and it's nice that they they got  together at the end because you don't
xbxtkPxEpIE,13776880,13782239,need something spectacular you don't  need a massive ending with like all this
xbxtkPxEpIE,13782239,13789199,lore or anything like that just the fact  that they found each other  in a world full of
xbxtkPxEpIE,13789199,13795439,like chaos basically everything being  destroyed and everything being missing  and nobody being around and kind of
xbxtkPxEpIE,13795439,13801439,wondering  like where you belong in it  and then finding somebody else who's
xbxtkPxEpIE,13801439,13807840,also on the exact same journey just in  the other direction  is really really fun  and who knows maybe they'll get on the
xbxtkPxEpIE,13807840,13814160,boat and then go back to that place  where i  like all the  the buildings and things were in it you
xbxtkPxEpIE,13814160,13820000,know  what if they made a third game now and  it was two-player
xbxtkPxEpIE,13820000,13825040,so each of you did something on the ship  or it could be two player so one of you
xbxtkPxEpIE,13825040,13831680,controls the little red guy and one of  you controls the new guy  that'll be fun  but then again how do you play it if you
xbxtkPxEpIE,13831680,13836800,don't have a friend to play with or  somebody online to play it with  um
xbxtkPxEpIE,13836800,13842399,and there is something about oh we put  it on the back  we put the little train one from last
xbxtkPxEpIE,13842399,13849199,time on to the back and  sailed away with it  because the theme of the game is like
xbxtkPxEpIE,13849199,13855840,loneliness  and trying to like find somebody else  and same with the previous one so i
xbxtkPxEpIE,13855840,13863279,guess having somebody else with you  would kind of change that vibe quite a  bit  yeah well done visuals were gorgeous
xbxtkPxEpIE,13863279,13871760,music was gorgeous  there's a couple of times i got a little  confused as to what i was supposed to be  doing but it wasn't that much
xbxtkPxEpIE,13871840,13877439,um  and i really like the idea of having the  boat be able to like go under the water
xbxtkPxEpIE,13877439,13882561,and then  [Music]  check out that kind of stuff
xbxtkPxEpIE,13883680,13890479,we'd love to know how  i mean maybe they're just going to move  on from it you can totally move on from  the fire series and create something
xbxtkPxEpIE,13890479,13895680,else  right now like you don't have to do a  third game
xbxtkPxEpIE,13895680,13902239,i'm just trying to think if they did do  a third game what would they iterate  upon  have the
xbxtkPxEpIE,13902239,13909520,have their little like train thing on  the back  and then you can like take it out and  go other places i don't know
xbxtkPxEpIE,13909520,13914560,there's something so fun about managing  your ship and managing the fuel and
xbxtkPxEpIE,13914560,13922561,managing  the speed and everything i feel like i  was a bit clunkier about it in this game  compared to the previous one
xbxtkPxEpIE,13923279,13928319,um but there was just a whole lot more  to it there was a lot more to take in
xbxtkPxEpIE,13928319,13933840,um but yeah that was fun i had a great  time with that
xbxtkPxEpIE,13933840,13940160,do you think there's anything at the end  oh
xbxtkPxEpIE,13940160,13947199,never mind that was it it just went back  to the menu  anyway well thank you guys so much for  watching this anyone who sat through the
xbxtkPxEpIE,13947199,13953199,entire thing in one sitting  thank you most of all because that is  pure dedication and you deserve to be
xbxtkPxEpIE,13953199,13958880,thanked for that um but also if you just  watch the whole thing in general thank  you so much i appreciate it i really
xbxtkPxEpIE,13958880,13965120,love doing like  entire games in one video when they're  kind of of this size and it makes it
xbxtkPxEpIE,13965120,13971199,perfect for that atmosphere of just  getting in sitting down vibing and then  we get an entire story in one afternoon
xbxtkPxEpIE,13971199,13977439,and then we move on to the next thing  it's great and i i really really enjoyed  this so hopefully you did as well thank
xbxtkPxEpIE,13977439,13983439,you again for watching it let me know  what you thought about the game down in  the comments um  i don't know why you would be here if
xbxtkPxEpIE,13983439,13989760,you haven't watched the first one but if  you haven't watched that go watch that  one as well very similar vibes um but
xbxtkPxEpIE,13989760,13994880,also there's tons of other series and  games and stuff that i played on the  channel recently and before so there's
xbxtkPxEpIE,13994880,14000960,plenty of stuff to watch if you're  in the mood to watch something else  today uh but above all else thanks for
xbxtkPxEpIE,14000960,14004319,watching and i'll see you next
