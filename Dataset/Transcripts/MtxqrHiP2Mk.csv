MtxqrHiP2Mk,613600,615680,bell peppers but doug still has one more
MtxqrHiP2Mk,615680,617680,trick up his sleeve there's this dark
MtxqrHiP2Mk,617680,619760,brown part that is the most prized part
MtxqrHiP2Mk,619760,621519,because it's gonna just be so crunchy
MtxqrHiP2Mk,621519,623360,and full of flavor we build up that
MtxqrHiP2Mk,623360,625519,crust over and over again that richness
MtxqrHiP2Mk,625519,627040,that comes in any dish like that's where
