RQdbmtBJT6U,0,5338,"If you study successful people and you do what they do, you'll be more successful."
RQdbmtBJT6U,5714,11845,"And if you study unsuccessful people and you avoid doing what they do, then you will not be a failure."
RQdbmtBJT6U,12220,18935,"And the one of the things I found that if you study success,  you begin to internalize success principles and if you practice proven success principles, and if you do "
RQdbmtBJT6U,18935,24816,"what successful men and women have done throughout history, then you will be successful, too.  And I've come to ten key qualities."
RQdbmtBJT6U,24816,31740,"Each of these ten qualities that successful men and women have starts with the letter C.  And the interesting thing about these qualities is, first of all,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,32157,37912,"with them, success is predictable, and without them, failure is predictable.  That if you have these ten qualities, there's nothing in the world"
RQdbmtBJT6U,37912,44753,"that can stop you from being an outstanding success.  And if you lack sometimes even one of these qualities that can be enough,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,44753,49507,it can be the weak link in the chain that dooms one to a life of underachievement and failure.
RQdbmtBJT6U,50050,60268,"The second principle that I discovered with regard to these qualities is that they are all habit patterns of mind.  And that nobody starts off with them, and that you can learn them and that you can develop them with practice."
RQdbmtBJT6U,60518,67901,"And the third thing that I found is that if you will practice these principles until they become habits,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,68485,75283,"until they become automatic for you, then nothing can stop you.  So, let's talk about these principles. They start with the letter C, each one of them. There’s 10 principles."
RQdbmtBJT6U,75366,85043,"The first principle starts with the letter C, it says Clarity.  And clarity is the starting point of all success. It means clarity of thinking. It means thinking clearly."
RQdbmtBJT6U,85210,94802,"And it extends from thinking clearly to a series of other things.  With regard to clarity, it means the ability to determine exactly what it is that you want to be, have or do in life."
RQdbmtBJT6U,95053,102894,"And the more I study successful men and women, the more I find that every single one of them, the top 5%  are very clear about where it is they're going and what it is they want to accomplish."
RQdbmtBJT6U,102894,113571,"And when I look at unsuccessful men and women or men and women who seem to be unhappy and floundering,  I find that almost invariably they have a very, very limited sense of direction, sometimes no sense of direction at all."
RQdbmtBJT6U,113947,121411,"You see, we as human beings are goal seeking organisms.  We only function at our very best when we're working toward accomplishing something that is important to us."
RQdbmtBJT6U,121621,130046,"And in my estimation, 80 to 90% of all the unhappiness,  hostility, violence, psychosomatic illness, alcoholism, drug addiction and so on in our society"
RQdbmtBJT6U,130296,137178,"is caused by people having no sense of direction. They don't know where they're going.  And if you understand this principle, this principle is terribly important."
RQdbmtBJT6U,137303,143810,"You can be the most talented, the smartest, the best educated person  with the most valuable contacts and all the advantages in life,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,144018,149691,"but if you are not focused, it doesn't do you any good at all.  I wrote in an article for The Wall Street Journal that"
RQdbmtBJT6U,149858,155071,"if you do not have clear, specific goals for your life, you are doomed forever to work for people who do."
RQdbmtBJT6U,155989,165874,And that seems to be the case. And yet only 5% of people have goals.  So the key starting point with regard to clarity is to know where it is you're going and what it is you want to be
RQdbmtBJT6U,165999,171004,and what it is you want to have and what it is you want to do.  The second key with regard to clarity is decisiveness.
RQdbmtBJT6U,171337,176384,Be decisive. I have never met a successful person who was indecisive.  And I've never met a failure who was decisive.
RQdbmtBJT6U,176676,184100,"Be decisive, develop the characteristic and quality of decisiveness.  We know that the reason why we are indecisive is because we're afraid of making a mistake."
RQdbmtBJT6U,184434,194652,"But the terrible thing is that the way that we think becomes a habit.  And the habit of indecisiveness can condemn us to failure. We can be talented and intelligent and ambitious,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,194903,200200,"but if we cannot make the hard decisions in our life and if we cannot make decisions readily,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,200450,207749,"and what happens is we always have to work for people who do make decisions readily.  Now, the interesting thing about decisions is that about 80% of decisions"
RQdbmtBJT6U,208082,216925,"should be made the first time they come up.  80% of decisions should be made the first time they come up.  And if you make decisions every single time they come up, sooner or later you will develop the habit of decisiveness."
RQdbmtBJT6U,217133,222263,"You'll be very clear about what it is you want.  And it's easy to make decisions, if you know what it is you want to accomplish."
RQdbmtBJT6U,222430,229812,"One of the major reasons why people are indecisive, in my experience,  is they have no idea what they wanna accomplish.  It's almost like they come to the crossroads, but they don't know which direction to go."
RQdbmtBJT6U,230188,236236,"80% of all decisions should be made the first time they come up.  And I read a management consultants report on decisions. He said,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,237237,242533,"“The thing to do about decisions is to make a decision. And if that doesn't work, make another decision.  And if that doesn't work, make another decision."
RQdbmtBJT6U,242742,249457,"And that still doesn't work, you're probably in the wrong field anyway”.  But the interesting thing is that if you make a decision, you gather momentum."
RQdbmtBJT6U,249624,255504,"And the difference between successes and failures is not that successful people make right decisions,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,255713,263554,"It is that successful people make their decisions right.  In other words, once they have made a decision, they make it come out right."
RQdbmtBJT6U,263846,269060,The third point under clarity is to have a vision for yourself and a vision for your life.
RQdbmtBJT6U,269727,275942,"The key to having a vision is to have a dream. They say in the song,  “You've gotta have a dream, if you want to make a dream come true”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,276442,284742,"And you can fulfill your dreams. All the great movers and shakers throughout all of history have been dreamers.  They've been people with dreams, they've been people with visions. All leaders have vision."
RQdbmtBJT6U,284951,293626,"In the Book of Solomon, it says, “Where there is no vision, the people perish”.  And the metaphysical meaning of that is that where people lack vision,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,293876,302135,"they perish inside because they lose the excitement and the thrill of life.  And what most people do, because of negative experiences, because of fear of failure and so on"
RQdbmtBJT6U,302427,308391,"is they if they have a vision at all, they tone it down, so it's so small and so safe, that doesn't turn them on."
RQdbmtBJT6U,308599,316858,"It doesn't excite them. And they wonder why life isn't exciting.  Every one of us has had an experience at one time,  when we were small, we had a vision of being growing up and having our own cars."
RQdbmtBJT6U,316858,322572,"Since we grew older, we had a vision of having our own homes and our own families.  And as we grew older, we had a vision of traveling and going to Europe."
RQdbmtBJT6U,322780,331039,"We fulfill all our visions.  The wonderful thing is this is that we always tend to achieve our goals.  The problem is that our goals are set so low that even when we do achieve them,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,331039,338421,"they don't turn us on, they don't fill us with enthusiasm.  So dream big dreams and focus on results, not activities."
RQdbmtBJT6U,338671,345219,"This is the key: Be clear about the results that you're trying to accomplish.  This is one of the keys of peak performance, by the way. All peak performers are result oriented."
RQdbmtBJT6U,345386,352810,"All losers or underachievers, tend to be activity oriented.  And in activity orientation, what they do is they work very, very hard. Sometimes they work frantically,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,352810,363446,"sometimes they work longer hours than you do, but they lose sight of the results.  Ben Trigo, the strategic thinker, said, “Very worst thing in the world is to do very efficiently what need not be done at all”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,364072,374248,So focus on results. Here's a key question to ask yourself when in your working life.  I think it's one of the most important key questions. I'll give you two. Number one is: What results are expected of me?
RQdbmtBJT6U,374832,381589,"What results are expected of me? Not what activities, but what results or what outputs?  What am I supposed to produce in my job?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,381923,386677,A second question you can ask yourself is: Why am I on the payroll? Why am I on the payroll?
RQdbmtBJT6U,387178,394977,"Major reason why people fail in life is because of the expediency factor,  that we always do, and we always take the fastest and easiest route to get the things that we want."
RQdbmtBJT6U,395144,401234,But the fastest and easiest route in life is almost always the route to failure. It's short term gain for long term pain.
RQdbmtBJT6U,401359,408616,"We do what is fun and easy today, instead of what is hard and necessary.  And then we have to do what is hard and necessary at the end of our life when it's too late."
RQdbmtBJT6U,408950,414664,"And you find that the willingness and the ability to discipline yourself, to be clear about what it is you want,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,414831,420503,"to be clear where you're going, to be clear about the results that you're expected to accomplish,  and then to only work on those results,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,420753,427677,the ability to discipline yourself to do that is absolutely critical for success.  It is not possible to conceive of a person being successful
RQdbmtBJT6U,427885,433849,who is not capable of disciplining themselves to do what is hard  and what is necessary rather than what is fun and easy.
RQdbmtBJT6U,434517,441022,"And when, especially when it comes to managing your time, when it comes to looking at  what you should do on a day to day basis, focus on results not activities."
RQdbmtBJT6U,441149,451534,"Have your goals in writing. Write them out very specifically and clearly, and then do this.  Every single morning, rewrite your major goals in the first person singular as though they already existed."
RQdbmtBJT6U,452160,462461,"If for instance, if your goal is to earn $50,000 a year, every single morning, write, I earn $50,000 a year.  And then every single evening, take about five, ten minutes and review what you've done in the course of the day."
RQdbmtBJT6U,462587,467341,"And say, “What have I done right today? What have I done right that's moved me toward my goals”?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,467592,472555,"And second question is, “What would I do differently if I had today to do over again”?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,472930,481898,"Those four steps, writing and rewriting your goal each morning, reviewing them in the evening  and asking yourself those two questions, “What did I do right? What did I do that move me toward my goals today”?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,482190,489489,"“And what would I do differently if I had the day to live over”?  If you'll ask yourself those two questions,  in the next thirty days, you'll accomplish more than you accomplished in the last six months."
RQdbmtBJT6U,493576,499499,I notice that every single man or woman that I had studied  who had achieved any kind of success in any field whatsoever had done it
RQdbmtBJT6U,500249,510426,"after they had made a commitment to becoming excellent in that field.  I found that I never found a single person who was successful, who was not excellent at what they did."
RQdbmtBJT6U,510927,519643,"That competence, the commitment to becoming excellent in your chosen field is an  indispensable prerequisite for success, that if you are not good at what you do,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,519643,524232,"you haven't got a chance in our competitive society, unless you win the lottery."
RQdbmtBJT6U,525233,530863,"That success is predictable  If you commit yourself to becoming excellent, it does a whole lot of other things within your mind,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,530863,537119,"but if you commit yourself to becoming excellent, it changes everything about you.  And only the top 5 or 10% are excellent."
RQdbmtBJT6U,537245,542375,"You've heard the rule, the 80/20 rule, the Pareto principle, that the top 20% of salespeople make 80% of the sales,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,542875,551925,that the bottom 80% of sales people make 20% of the sales.  You know what the difference in the ratio is there? The ratio is the difference between sixteen to one.
RQdbmtBJT6U,552385,558975,That the average income of the people in the top 20% is sixteen times  the average income of the people in the bottom 80%.
RQdbmtBJT6U,559392,567024,Now let me ask you a question: Does it mean the people in the top 20% are sixteen times better  than the people in the bottom 80%? Sixteen times more experienced?
RQdbmtBJT6U,567024,571737,Do they work sixteen times the number of hours?  Do they have sixteen times the number of years of education?
RQdbmtBJT6U,572488,578744,Are they sixteen times more handsome? Are they sixteen times anything?  You know that it's not humanly possible to be twice as smart as somebody else.
RQdbmtBJT6U,579495,585418,But 20% of these people are making sixteen times the average of the rest.  Prudential Insurance Company did a study some years ago.
RQdbmtBJT6U,585710,591966,"And they put a thousands of agents that they have throughout the United States into their computers  and compare their income, and it came out the 80/20 rule worked."
RQdbmtBJT6U,592133,598097,"20% of their salespeople were doing 80% of the business.  While they had all the data on the computer, so they ran it through one more time. They said,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,598931,603811,“What's the average income of the top 20% of the top 20% compared to the bottom 80%”?
RQdbmtBJT6U,604020,611735,"Now for those mathematicians among you, that works out to the top 4%.  What was the average income? They found the top 4% were earning on average"
RQdbmtBJT6U,611736,617825,thirty-two times the average of the people in the bottom 80%.  So they said this is interesting. And they ran that through one more time.
RQdbmtBJT6U,618075,623998,They found that the top 20% of the top 20% of the top 20% which is the top 0.8%. That's good.
RQdbmtBJT6U,624582,630462,Top 0.8% were earning on average 54 times the average of the people in the bottom 80%.
RQdbmtBJT6U,631797,639180,"What they found is that in every state and in every major city  where they had an office with a large number of agents working out of it, there was one agent"
RQdbmtBJT6U,639680,648188,"who was selling the same product at the same price to the same people  with the same competition, under the same circumstances, under the same set of difficulties in the economy,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,648356,655905,who was earning fifty times the amount of the average adult.  That there were fifty agents in the office and one person was earning more than all of them put together.
RQdbmtBJT6U,656113,664372,Isn't that amazing? And one of the things they found is that the key to this  was that the each one of these agents had made the commitment to become excellent early in their career.
RQdbmtBJT6U,664580,669709,"They didn't say: I'm gonna go into this, so I'm gonna earn a living.  They said: I'm gonna go into this and I'm going to be the best."
RQdbmtBJT6U,670127,675216,And they read every single book written by the top agents.  And they went to every single seminar. And they listened to every single tape.
RQdbmtBJT6U,675424,680805,And they spent every single hour they could with other successful people learning  what they needed to know to be successful.
RQdbmtBJT6U,681180,689021,"You must commit yourself to excellence. You must commit yourself to becoming the best.  And the wonderful thing is that excellence is a journey, it's not a destination. You never get there."
RQdbmtBJT6U,689188,696027,"Complacency and satisfaction are the key enemies of excellence.  But once you commit yourself to becoming excellent, the whole world opens up for you."
RQdbmtBJT6U,696362,703244,"A very important point of excellence is, it just means simply this:  Do your best every time out and always strive to do it better."
RQdbmtBJT6U,704036,710292,"A second point with regard to excellence, is this:  Is that if you are not excellent in your field, you don't go anywhere."
RQdbmtBJT6U,710793,715256,"You're locked in place. I had a young man come up to me at an appointment seminar not long ago and he said,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,716090,722304,"“There's no opportunities in sales”. He said, “I just got laid off”.  I said, “If you were good in your field, you would not have been laid off"
RQdbmtBJT6U,722596,728269,"because good salespeople are the rarest people in our society”.  And he just said, “Well”. I said, “Have you ever studied sales”?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,728269,734692,"He said, “Well, I don't need to study sales”. I said, “Why not?”  He said, “Well, I just do what comes naturally”. I said, “I rest my case”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,735317,742240,"Excellence yields opportunities because when you become good, you open up.  It's almost like the Red Sea of opportunity opens up in front of you."
RQdbmtBJT6U,742366,748664,"When you become excellent, you come to the attention of people  and people try to get you and they give you more responsibilities and more opportunities."
RQdbmtBJT6U,748831,756714,"And you know, when you put on your business card  that you are the top person in your particular field, people like to buy from the best salespeople in their field."
RQdbmtBJT6U,757047,766974,"And if you're going to do anything at all, the only time you're gonna get any joy out of it is if you do it well.  You see, when we do something well, it gives us a feeling of self esteem and pride. We feel like a winner."
RQdbmtBJT6U,767141,773397,"But when we do things in an average way, it doesn't give us anything.  You notice that it doesn't give us anything. We do it an average way, it doesn't give us anything."
RQdbmtBJT6U,773397,780196,"But if we do it in a really exceptional way, it makes us feel wonderful about ourselves.  That's why the companies that have committed to excellence are not"
RQdbmtBJT6U,780446,786327,"hundreds of percent better in any given area.  What they are, is there are 1 or 2% better in a hundred different areas."
RQdbmtBJT6U,786744,795126,"And that's the key. You see, you don't have to be a quantum leap different from somebody else.  You just have to be a little tiny bit different in the critical areas that make a difference."
RQdbmtBJT6U,795127,800841,"And you can achieve that simply by making it a goal, setting it as a goal, and working on it."
RQdbmtBJT6U,800841,807181,"You can become anything that you want to become.  The harder you work, the better you get. The harder you work, the better you get."
RQdbmtBJT6U,807389,817358,"You know, in our society, there's a lot of controversy over, Why should I work so hard for my job?  The fact of the matter is that less than 5% really succeed, that less than 5% of the population really succeed at life."
RQdbmtBJT6U,817608,824198,"Of a hundred people working today, only one will be wealthy when they retire,  four will be financially independent, fifteen will have some savings,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,824448,831831,80% will be broke and dependent upon charities and pensions.  Only 1 or 2% of people in each generation really makes it in life.
RQdbmtBJT6U,832039,837503,"In every single study, those people who make it are those who work hard, hard, hard."
RQdbmtBJT6U,837837,845970,"And if you think that it's hard to be successful, try being a failure.  Try coming to the end of the trail with no money, dependent upon pensions."
RQdbmtBJT6U,846178,853561,"And you don't know what hard is until you try living like that.  But if you work hard, the average self-made millionaire in America works twelve"
RQdbmtBJT6U,853978,863237,"to thirteen hours a day, works about sixty to sixty-five hours a week.  I tell you this with regard to hard work that in our society, you only work eight hours a day for survival."
RQdbmtBJT6U,863696,869243,"Everything over eight hours is for success.  And if you're only working eight hours a day, you're in trouble."
RQdbmtBJT6U,869785,877960,"You're only working eight hours a day, you better have a rich uncle,  or you better have somebody else that's going to take care of you  because eight hours a day only gets you survival in our society. Because it's so competitive"
RQdbmtBJT6U,878127,888053,"that somebody else is working nine, they've got an edge on you.  Somebody else is working ten, they've got a bigger edge on you.  Every hour over eight that you invest is an investment in your future, is an investment in your success."
RQdbmtBJT6U,888262,895227,"And if you put in the hours over eight,  whether it's studying or reading or working, if you put in the hours, it will pay off and it will pay off in spades."
RQdbmtBJT6U,895477,901983,"It's like throwing seed in the ground. When you throw a seed in the ground,  the plant that comes up is not just one seed, it's hundreds of seeds. There's a crop"
RQdbmtBJT6U,902318,909240,"that you put in, but you must put the seed in the ground first.  The market only pays excellent rewards for excellent performance."
RQdbmtBJT6U,909533,915039,It pays average rewards for average performance.  It pays below average rewards for below average performance.
RQdbmtBJT6U,915289,921795,"And I talk to men and women all over America who are unhappy  and they're sad and they don't like their work, and, you know, why? Because they're not good at what they're doing."
RQdbmtBJT6U,922129,931305,"Let me give you a couple of key points.  Is first of all, you'll never have a feeling of self-esteem and self-worth,  you'll never feel wonderful about yourself until you know that you are good at what you're doing."
RQdbmtBJT6U,931805,939355,"Number two is, If you do not love your work enough to want to be the best at it,  get out of it the way you would get out of a burning house."
RQdbmtBJT6U,939939,947904,"Do not stay at a job that you do not love because it's the high road  to failure, dissatisfaction, frustration and unhappiness in life."
RQdbmtBJT6U,951617,956580,Concentration. I think that the ability to focus and concentration are the two keys to success in life.
RQdbmtBJT6U,956914,961919,That the ability to focus clearly and know exactly what it is  you want to accomplish and the ability to concentrate single mindedly
RQdbmtBJT6U,962002,966966,on accomplishing that one thing without diversion or distraction are the keys to success.
RQdbmtBJT6U,967466,973430,It's the number one key to effectiveness is to be able to sit down and look at your work and use the 80/20 rule.
RQdbmtBJT6U,973722,980145,"Say to yourself, “Which is the 20%  of the number of things that I have to do that account for 80% of the value of my work?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,980396,986944,"And always work on the top 20%.  You see, in life there's never enough time to do everything, but there's always enough time to do the important things."
RQdbmtBJT6U,987111,994326,"Instead of doing what is fun and easy, which is what most people do.  you know what they do, they make a list of everything they have to do,  and then they start at the bottom of the list and they work on the irrelevant things."
RQdbmtBJT6U,994326,1000790,"At the end of the day, they haven't got anything done.  Successful people, peak performers, concentrate on the top items."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1000791,1005921,And remember anything other than working on the top items on your list is a waste of your time.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1006088,1012761,"And time management is not just time management. Time management is life management.  You can do anything you want with your life, if you’ll manage your time properly."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1012761,1021020,"We all have the same twenty-four hours a day and the ability to concentrate,  concentrate, concentrate, to discipline yourself, to use willpower and perseverance,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1021228,1027234,to concentrate on one thing at a time is a quality of all success.  Nothing great has ever been accomplished
RQdbmtBJT6U,1027401,1033115,without the ability to concentrate single mindedly on one thing at a time.  Always concentrate on the best use of your time.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1033282,1037536,Here is my favorite time management question which I give to you for free. It's simply this:
RQdbmtBJT6U,1038829,1044876,"Before you start anything, ask yourself, “What is the most valuable use of my time right now”?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1045168,1051717,"Make a list and say, “What is the most valuable use of my time right now”?  When you get into your car, say, “What is the most valuable use of my time right now”?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1051842,1060517,"When you leave the house or leave the office, say, “What is the most valuable use of my time right now”?  Ask yourself that question over and over and over again, repeat it and repeat it"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1060517,1066648,"and repeat it until it's driven into the subconscious mind as a command.  And whenever you have a temptation to do something that is small and irrelevant,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1066940,1075032,that command will go Blam! What is the most valuable use of your time right now? And you go woo.  And it'll push you into doing what is the most valuable use of your time.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1075282,1081997,"And whenever you're working on the most valuable use of your time, you feel great.  You get concentrated. Effort is a source of energy and enthusiasm."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1081997,1088003,It makes you feel wonderful when you're working on something important.  And it makes you feel nothing when you're working on something irrelevant.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1088837,1095260,Develop a sense of urgency.  A sense of urgency is a quality that is possessed by only 2% of the population.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1095677,1100599,2% of the population do things fast. 2% of the population have a bias for action.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1100766,1105646,"In Tom Peters' wonderful book, In Search of Excellence, he says “All the excellent companies have a bias for action”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1105854,1111527,And all of the companies that do not classify or do not come into the excellence category
RQdbmtBJT6U,1111944,1117074,"do things when they get around to it.  You call them up and you have a problem or a complaint,  you hear from them three or four weeks later."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1117282,1126375,"But the excellent companies, you call up with a problem or complaint,  bang, there's somebody back to you in two minutes.  So, develop a sense of urgency. Get the reputation as the person who does things fast."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1126625,1131213,"Develop a reputation for speed and dependability, and your future will just open up in front of you."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1131922,1139638,"Imagine if you own a company and you had two people in the company.  And both of them were reasonably well talented, both of them were doing reasonably well."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1139763,1147729,"Except one person had a sense of urgency and did things fast, and every time you give him something to do,  they took it in and they ran with it like a ball player catching a fumble and running for the goal line."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1147729,1154319,"The other person got to it after lunch or maybe next Monday or  no rush, week's almost over, Thursday afternoon and so on."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1155320,1162870,Which one would you give additional responsibility to?  Which one would you promote? Which one would you spend money training?  Which one would you send to places where you needed help?
RQdbmtBJT6U,1163203,1168458,"It's always the person with a sense of urgency.  And if you'll develop that habit of working fast,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1168458,1176008,"working fast, that sense of urgency, act now, do it now, do it now, do it now.  Somebody calls you up and has a question, get back to them now."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1176216,1185142,"Somebody has a problem, get back to them now.  Somebody needs something, move on it quickly.  If you have to forego coffee breaks or lunch or something else, move fast."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1185142,1193817,"If you develop that reputation for speed, it will be worth a fortune to you.  Takes a little while, but it's a habit.  Most people just sort of shuffle through life. You know, they get to it when they feel like it."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1194109,1204995,"But all the excellent people, all the high performers have a sense of urgency.  And finally complete each job that you start, get on with the job and stay with it till it's a 100% finished."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1205245,1210292,The difficulty that people have in completing their task is absolutely amazing.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1210542,1217090,"In a study amongst 106 chief executive officers last year, they were asked what qualities out of twenty-six"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1217591,1223388,would be most important in putting a person on the fast track to success in your company?  And they agreed almost unanimously on two qualities.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1223388,1229185,"Number one, the ability to set priorities, to determine what is relevant and separate it from what is irrelevant."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1229353,1234399,"And number two is a sense of urgency, the ability to get on with a job and get it finished and get it finished fast."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1235234,1243408,"The Gallup organization that just did a wonderful book called The Great American Success Story.  They surveyed 1500 people in Marquis Who's Who in America,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1243408,1249289,"1500 of the most respected men and women in America.  And they asked them, “What do you consider to be the most important single quality of success”?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1249414,1256213,"And they agreed almost unanimously on common sense, just common sense,  good common sense. As my friend Charlie Jarvis says, “The average person has an enormous"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1256213,1266223,amount of common sense because they haven't used any of it yet”.  You can train your mind to have common sense. You can train your mind to think things through before acting.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1266431,1273105,"In my experience, action without thinking is the cause of every failure.  Action without thinking is the cause of every failure."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1273272,1277526,And common sense comes from taking the time to think things through before you act.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1278360,1290289,"Listen to your intuition.  Your intuition is one of the best guides that you possibly have.  Is that each person has inside them an intuitive sense, which will always give you the exact right answer for you."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1290455,1295669,"They've done some studies between men and women.  When they test women's intuition, you've heard of women's intuition? Everybody's heard of women's intuition."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1295877,1303802,"They find that when you give men and women tests  and they're asked to answer on the basis of their intuition,  men's intuition is equally as accurate as women's intuition."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1304052,1310142,"The only difference is that in real life, women have the intelligence to listen  to their intuition, which is why they're smarter than men."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1310892,1318817,"And men do not listen to their intuition, instead, they override their intuition  because they're trying to get something they want the fastest and easiest way,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1318900,1324281,"even if their gut feeling says, Don't do it.  Your intuition will always give you the most accurate answer for you."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1324281,1332748,It's almost like an in-built computer that will take all of your life experience and knowledge  and everything going on around you and give you exactly the right answer. So listen to your intuition.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1333290,1340922,"Learn from your setbacks. This is one of the characteristics of high performing  men and women is that every single time they have a problem or a difficulty, they sit back and they dissect it."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1341089,1349681,"And they learn everything possible from it. They try to develop general principles.  From each setback, they say, What is the valuable lesson I can learn?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1349806,1358106,"So, you take a look at everything that has happened to you.  Take a look at the very most difficult experience that you're in right now,  and ask yourself, “What is the most valuable lesson I can learn from this experience”?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1358398,1365029,"And believe me, if you look for the lesson, in the Bible it says, “Seek and you shall find”.  It doesn't say, Seek and occasionally, you might find something."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1365405,1374456,"It says, Seek and you shall find. If you look for the valuable lesson  or the seed of an equal or greater advantage or benefit in every difficulty, you will find it."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1374998,1383298,It's always there. And I love the line from Socrates that says: “The unexamined life is not worth living”.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1383965,1393016,Which means that the life where you do not take the time to reflect on your experiences.  Aristotle said that: Wisdom is an equal measure of experience plus reflection.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1393809,1399564,"And the reason so few people have wisdom is what they have is experience, experience, experience,  but they never take the time to sit back and reflect."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1403110,1409699,"Tap your creative potential.  Accept the fact that every single human being is a genius, and all successful men and women are creative."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1409991,1419042,"They're creative in that they respond to their world differently.  They ask questions, they're flexible, they're curious. You know what, the hallmark of creativity is curiosity."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1419376,1424172,The hallmark of ignorance and stupidity is the cessation or stopping from asking questions.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1424548,1431638,"And I've worked with some of the brightest men and women in this nation.  And I find that the smartest people of all, the ones that have the greatest education"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1431638,1437853,and the most experience are the ones who ask the most questions.  They ask questions almost as if they were children.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1438103,1445527,"But they never stop asking questions. They're very open and flexible.  And they have the ability, once they learn a new piece of information, to drop what they're doing,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1445777,1451491,"if the new information contradicts it, and do something else.  Do you know what most people do? Most people keep on doing what they're doing"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1452409,1457164,"until they run into a wall. As they say, the more you do what you're doing, the more you'll get of what you got."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1458373,1463420,"Someone pointed out to me not long ago and I think it's very true,  is that: All changes in our life come with the input of new information."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1464212,1473722,"That if we do not have new information, we keep on doing the same thing forever as a result of inertia.  And creative people are always looking for faster, better, easier, cheaper, newer ways to do things."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1473722,1478977,"Remember, 80% of everything that we are doing today in our general business will be different five years from now."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1478977,1485150,"80% of the products that we use, the food that we eat, the cars we drive,  this music we listen to, the movies we go to, even the streets we drive on,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1485150,1495494,"80% of everything will be new in five years. That's how rapidly things are changing.  According to the research, all you need is an idea that's 10% new to start a fortune, an idea is 10% new."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1495494,1500457,"As a matter of fact, an idea that's more than 10% new is probably too new for the average consumer to accept it."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1500707,1505670,"Interesting point: The single greatest source of self-made millionaires in America, do you know what industry it is?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1506129,1513386,Can you guess? You wouldn't believe it. Dry cleaning.  Dry cleaning shops is the greatest single source.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1513678,1521645,"One industry that's contributed more self-made millionaires than any other industry, dry cleaning shops.  Now, the key to this, if you wanna become wealthy, if you want to be, I'm going to tell you something."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1521811,1528109,"That if you want to be wealthy in life, if you wish to become very wealthy,  if you wish to become even a millionaire, you can do it, if you're willing to pay the price."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1528401,1535492,But most people become millionaires by offering a good or service  that people use all the time and they offer it just a little bit better.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1535825,1540997,They do it just a little bit faster. They put a little bit more grace or finesse into what they're doing.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1541206,1547002,"They handle it, they wrap it. They are more polite.  The restaurant that has people coming back to it"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1547170,1554928,"may have food that's only 5% different, but it's the way the people handle it that's so different.  You can do anything you want in life, all you have to do is find an idea that's 10% new."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1554928,1560684,"And you'll find it if you flood your mind, read magazines,  read books, ask questions, ask why people are doing things the way they're doing."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1560850,1566648,"Look for ideas, keep your mind open and flexible, ask questions.  Remember, one new idea is all you need to start a fortune."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1566815,1572695,"And within every single person here you have four ideas, an average of four ideas per year driving to and from work."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1572696,1580495,"Any one of which will make you a fortune, anyone of which will make you wealthy.  How many times have you been going about your daily business and you see the need for a product or service?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1580704,1585750,"And you say, “Now I wonder why somebody doesn't produce that”?  And we say, “Well, can't be any good because I thought of it”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1585959,1592841,"And then two or three years later, a company comes up with that idea  or some company and makes a million dollars. And you say, “I thought of that idea two or three years ago”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1593091,1598221,Every single person here has had that experience.  What you have to do is trust your ideas. Trust your ideas.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1598221,1604059,"If you decide that you're going to earn a certain amount of money,  that you're going to achieve a certain level of wealth,  that you're going to achieve a certain life estate,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1604269,1612694,"and you program that into your subconscious mind and you then turn it over to your intuition,  you will get the ideas, the insights, the inspirations necessary to achieve your goals."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1612986,1619658,"And that's the only difference between very wealthy, successful people and the average person  is that they simply follow their intuition. They're not smarter,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1619826,1623913,"they're not different, they're not more educated, they're not more talented, they just follow that inner guide."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1625081,1632505,"Consideration is based on the fact that the quality of your relationships with other people,  more than anything else, will determine your success in life."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1632839,1638136,How well you get along with other human beings? Your quality of interaction will determine
RQdbmtBJT6U,1638345,1643683,"your happiness, your success, your achievements, your wealth and anything else.  Charles Schwab, the founder of US Steal, said"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1643892,1649189,"that I will pay more for the ability to get along with others than for any other skill in America.  And that's very, very true."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1649689,1657030,Develop the people skills that you need to be successful.  Take courses in communications. Take courses in effective listening. Take courses in public speaking.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1657197,1666873,"You know, one of the most important parts of communicating  to get along well with others is the size of your vocabulary.  You've probably heard that before. The size of your vocabulary, your ability to express yourself orally,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1667082,1672003,"your ability to stand on your feet, your ability to write effectively and get your point across to others"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1672545,1679135,will have a tremendous impact on your life.  Because you cannot imagine a successful person who cannot communicate effectively with other people.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1679386,1684808,"And you can develop the capacity to be an excellent communicator.  If you were to learn one new word a day,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1685100,1691856,"if you were to make an effort by carrying a dictionary around, I used to,  I have taught myself French, Spanish, German, and smatterings of about ten other languages."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1692190,1697862,"And the way I taught myself that was I learned the basic vocabulary, I studied it.  Earned the basic vocabulary and carried a dictionary around with me."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1697862,1705245,"And every time I saw a word I didn't know, I looked it up in the dictionary.  If you looked up one word a day, which would be 365 words a year,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1705495,1713294,"within five years, you'd be one of the best educated people in history.  Because every word that you learned would introduce you to about ten more, sort of open the door to about ten more."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1713461,1720343,The average child learns almost 5000 words in the first five years of life.  The average adult learns less than five words a year.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1721219,1726683,"And yet it is, words are the tools with which we think.  That the better words we have, the better is our thinking."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1726683,1734899,"Just like the more tools a craftsman has, the better is what he creates.  The more words we have, the better is the world that we create. So communication is important."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1735108,1741364,"The most important part about consideration is to practice the Golden Rule.  I think that the Golden Rule,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1741364,1747328,"which is based on the law of sowing and reaping. Whatsoever that you would have men do unto you, do sow,  do you sow unto them."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1747704,1752792,"You get out of life exactly what you put in. What you sow in your relationships, you reap in your relationships."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1753042,1759007,"The Golden Rule is the key to consideration.  But you can practice, you can learn to be more effective with other people."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1759174,1766473,"You can take courses in it. You can study behavioral psychology.  The Carnegie Institute of Technology did a study about seven years ago, ten years ago now,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1766973,1773730,"and they studied 10,000 men and women who were let go from their companies.  And they found that 95% of the people who were let go from their companies"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1773730,1779986,"were let go because of their inability to get along with others.  This is caused by low self-esteem more than anything else, in my estimation."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1780236,1786033,"Those of you who know, know that low self-esteem more than anything else causes our personality problems."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1786034,1791331,"Not liking ourselves, not accepting ourselves, feeling inferior inside causes us to lash out at other people."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1791539,1799214,"And the wonderful thing is that if you're clear about your goals and you're committed to becoming excellent  and you're concentrate single minded on what is important to you,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1800340,1805303,"you have a tendency to like yourself more,  Your self-esteem goes up. Your ability to get along with other people goes up."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1805470,1812018,"But if you have no goals and you're not very good at what you do  and you're just doing whatever comes to hand, then your self-esteem goes down."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1812393,1819317,"So one of the things that we're talking about here is the building of the   characteristics, the personality qualities that guarantee success."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1819317,1823029,"And self esteem, of course, is the foundation of all success in relationship."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1827575,1832580,"Consistency is absolutely critical. You can have all of the others  but if you're inconsistent, it's going to really hurt you. Consistency means "
RQdbmtBJT6U,1833623,1839170,"that dependable, steady, predictable work is always vastly superior"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1839379,1848054,"to spurts or flashes of brilliance and genius.  That the person who is like the tortoise, who just plod steadily away, hold Steady Eddie"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1848304,1855228,is always the person who tends to be more successful than the one who  flashes here and flashes there but cannot be counted on over the long term.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1855562,1861192,"Be consistent in your relationships. Especially, be consistent with your family.  Be consistent with your friends."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1861192,1867866,Be consistent with your boss. Be consistent in your work.  Make it so that you are the type of person that everybody can depend upon.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1868074,1873037,"That people will believe in and they'll depend upon, and they know that if you say something that you'll do it."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1873329,1878835,"That if you say you'll be somewhere or if you undertake a responsibility, that you will fulfill that responsibility."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1878835,1883882,"That sort of consistency, that sort of dependability is one of the most valuable things in the world of work today."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1884007,1893141,"I work with so many companies and I have staff that work in my companies,  and I know that the greatest joy that an employer can have is to give a person a job and know that it will be done."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1893641,1898771,"And the most aggravating thing in the world is to give a person a job and have no idea if it'll be done,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1898938,1906029,"If it'll be done to a particular quality, if it will be done on time or anything else.  Just being the steady person. One of the things that I found, if I can"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1906529,1914662,"pass this on to you, one of the things that I found when I was a young man, this cost me about ten years of life.  I thought that you had to have good grades in school in order to be successful."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1914787,1922045,And then later I thought that you had to have a university education in order to be successful.  And then later I thought that successful people are people who are somehow better than you and I.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1922420,1928134,"They somehow have unique talents, that somehow  the gods have descended from Olympus and touched them on the heads."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1928343,1937602,"But one of the things that I found is that nobody is better than you or I.  When you see men or women accomplishing great things,  they're not better than you or I. They're not different from you or I. They're just doing things in a different way."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1938311,1944816,"You look at a person you went to school with who is now doing surgery as a doctor,  the person is the same person, except that they've learned how to do surgery."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1945068,1954702,"You look at a person who you went to school with, who is now an outstanding success in a particular field,  all they've done is learned how to be a success in that field and consistency."
RQdbmtBJT6U,1954702,1959499,"There's a law of accumulation in the universe, if I can pass this on, a law of accumulation that says that"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1959874,1966631,"even though you do a hundred things or a thousand things that you don't see,  eventually they accumulate and they gather a force of their own,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1966798,1972470,that every single great accomplishment in life  is a result of thousands of minor accomplishments that nobody ever sees.
RQdbmtBJT6U,1973137,1979518,"One of the people on the program, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, who had become successful as a singer,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1979644,1989070,"they said, “Isn't it wonderful that you become so successful as a singer”? She said, “Yes, it's wonderful”.  She said, “But when I'm up on stage in Las Vegas and I'm making $50,000 a week” or whatever happens to be,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1989237,1994158,"she says, “Nobody sees the sixteen years that I spent traveling around living in a van,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,1994534,2000081,singing in cheap honky tonks where people throw up on your piano and get drunk on the floor in front.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2000081,2005003,"Nobody sees the sixteen years of living on the road, living at an average of less than $5,000 a year."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2005128,2011634,What they see is the person up there on the stage”.  But every single great success was at one time a failure.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2011843,2018349,"And they failed and failed and failed and failed over and over again.  And all great successes are a story of failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, outstanding success,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2018725,2023688,"boy, ain't he lucky.  Isn't that right? Boy, he was lucky. He sure had the right connections."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2024230,2031571,"So consistency is important. And even if you don't see yourself getting the results,  be consistent. Keep working steady steady, steady, knowing"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2031738,2036826,"that you're accumulating, you're putting yourself on the side of the angels when you're working consistently."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2037869,2046461,"Finally, with regard to consistency, guard your integrity as a sacred thing.  As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Nothing at last is sacred but the integrity of your own mind”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2046711,2054802,"Never compromise your integrity for anything and never compromise your peace of mind for anything.  You see, compromising your peace of mind is a way of compromising your integrity."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2055053,2061516,"Never do anything that disrupts your peace of mind. If it makes you feel unhappy, get out of it.  Don't stay in relationships. Don't stay in jobs."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2061642,2067648,Don't stay in situations that cause your peace of mind to be disrupted.  Because your peace of mind is the highest good that you have.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2067940,2072778,And a person who practices consistency  consistently structures their life. So what they are doing
RQdbmtBJT6U,2073237,2078617,is being true to themselves.  What they are doing is living up to the very best that is in them as a human being.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2078950,2083998,"And that takes tremendous courage, takes tremendous courage because it's so easy to go along with the crowd."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2084165,2087543,But you'll never be really happy unless you know that you are being true to yourself.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2089294,2096886,"I found that the ability or the willingness to make a complete commitment to a job,  a commitment to a relationship, a commitment to a profession,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2097136,2105853,"to make a commitment is one of the hardest things that human beings do.  That very few people make commitments.  That most people in this room I hate to say it, most people in this room are not totally committed to their work."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2106187,2113193,"“Oh yeah, they're doing it, so they're in it. They're doing a reasonably good job. Nobody's fired them yet”. Right?  But they're not committed. Their whole heart isn't into it."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2113402,2120076,And yet no success is possible without commitment.  Emerson said that: Every great achievement is the triumph of enthusiasm.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2120409,2127625,"That the ability to commit yourself enthusiastically, wholeheartedly, 100%  to what you wanna do is the starting point of all achievement."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2127792,2135382,"That if you cannot commit yourself wholeheartedly, it probably means that it's not right for you.  And that all of us in life seek for something that we can commit ourselves to."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2135550,2141889,"Allan Cox, in his book The Achievers, which came out last year,  found that the executives in the corporations that he studied"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2141889,2149355,who achieved the very most in the shortest period of time  had found the proper niche for themselves and had lost themselves in their work.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2149772,2155610,"Dr. Shirley Blatnick, study of self-made millionaires.  83 out of 1500 people became self-made millionaires over 20 years."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2155862,2164244,"He found that the one quality that they all had in common was that they picked work that they loved,  they specialized in that work, they became very good in it,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2164954,2171502,"and they eventually became paid very well for it, and then they held on to the money.  I throw that last one in because I know a lot of you can relate to that."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2171669,2178258,"They held on to the money, they didn't gamble or speculate.  They were very conservative with their money. They got paid more and more and they held on to it."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2178634,2184974,He found that the quality that separated these people from the ones  who struggled for 20 years and weren't much further ahead than when they started
RQdbmtBJT6U,2185391,2191606,"was that they became totally absorbed in their work,  totally committed to their work. They lost themselves in their work."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2191606,2198403,"And when they lifted up their head about the age of forty-three, forty-four,  their accountant told them, by the way, you're worth over a million dollars now.  Did you know that?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2198613,2204827,Most of them became wealthy without even knowing it.  And so it's important that you find the work that you can commit yourself to.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2205036,2210708,"It's important that you find the relationship you can commit yourself to.  And if you are an employer and you have people working for you who are not committed to their work,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2210875,2217714,these people are like rotten apples in a barrel.  I have found that people who are not committed to their jobs are people  who will always cause trouble within an organization.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2217965,2223554,"And the people who are committed, you don't have to be the most talented  and you have to be the best looking, you don't have to be the best educated,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2223763,2232021,"but if you're committed to your work, you'll do more than all the people with all of those blessings.  So commitment is important. Commit yourself to your boss. Commit yourself to your job."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2232104,2238985,Commit yourself to your relationships.  Commit yourself to your company.  Loyalty is one of the most valued single qualities in work.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2238986,2244242,And Peter Drucker says that “More executives fail in life because of lack of loyalty
RQdbmtBJT6U,2244659,2252083,"to their companies, to their boss than for any other reason”.  And why is lack of loyalty? Lack of loyalty is just the expression of lack of commitment to the organization."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2255586,2265137,"Courage means that you have the ability, you have the willingness to confront your fears.  Because what I found over the years is that brave people, courageous people are not people who are not afraid."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2265304,2270101,"They're simply people who master their fears. They're simply people who face their fears, confront their fears."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2270351,2277858,"And Mark Twain said it many years ago, he said,  with regard to fear, he said, “Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2278484,2285908,"Now, fear and courage tend to be habits.  That if you are afraid and you give in to the fear and you back away,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2286158,2292623,"it becomes a habit to back away whenever you're afraid or unsure.  If you're afraid and you force yourself to confront the fear,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2292915,2299171,It becomes a habit to confront the fear whenever you find something that you're afraid of.  And you find that most fears disappear when you confront them.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2299505,2306053,"And most fears, fears of failure, fears of rejection,  fears of loss, fears of pain, fears of limitation, fears of the loss of a relationship,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2306220,2311182,"fears of ill health, most of these fears disappear when you confront them head on."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2311600,2321944,"It's almost like as you push them, they just turn into smoke and disappear.  Dare to go forward in your life. Dare to go forward in the direction of fulfilling your potential."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2322695,2328826,"Many years ago, I was a karate student. I was also a karate instructor.  And I competed in three international championships."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2329035,2334749,"And one of the things that I learned from my best karate instructors, and I studied under six world champions,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2335041,2341380,"is they told me that when you fight, always move forward.  Even if you're only moving forward a half an inch at a time is always move forward."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2341589,2348471,"So when you're moving forward, a 100% of your attention is forward.  But if you're moving backward even a half an inch at a time, half of your attention"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2348763,2357813,"is always behind you and where you're going.  So always move forward. Always have it, dare to go forward.  Whenever you have a choice of either staying still and playing it safe or moving forward,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2358147,2365029,"move forward, not because you'll necessarily succeed every time, because it reinforces  and cements the habit of moving forward."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2365571,2374871,"And most people, when they have a choice of moving forward or staying, playing it safe, play it safe.  But I think General MacArthur, General Douglas MacArthur said, “There's no security in life, only opportunity”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2375039,2379293,"Life is very perverse in a way, because the more we seek security, the less we have it."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2380252,2388511,"And the more we seek opportunity, the more we have security.  Helen Keller said this beautifully. She said, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2389387,2395767,"“That the tendency”, she said in the earlier parts of this statement,  she said, “The tendency to seek security is the low road to failure”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2396352,2401399,That courage is absolutely essential. And one of the things that I used to think that
RQdbmtBJT6U,2401732,2406695,"if you were really courageous, eventually you got to the point where you weren't afraid.  I'm going to tell you something that if you're not a little bit afraid,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2406821,2412451,"at least three or four nights a week, you're not trying hard enough.  If you're not falling your face over and over again,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2412660,2417665,"if you're not trembling when you go to sleep with your heart pounding,  it's then what is happening is you're not trying hard enough."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2417790,2424130,You're living too far within your potential.  That all really successful people live on the outside edge of what they're capable of.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2424422,2432304,And it's always a little bit scary on the outside edge because we all have feelings of uncertainty.  We all have fears. We all have doubts that hold us back.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2432555,2439186,But the brave person is simply the person who moves forward and keeps taking the chance.  And you cannot imagine a successful person without courage.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2439395,2444442,You cannot imagine a successful person without the courage to face  and confront their fears and to move forward.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2444692,2449779,"In my experience, the fear of failure is the greatest single reason for failure in adult life."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2450114,2455536,"The fear of failure, the fear of making a mistake, of losing our money, our time, our effort  is what paralyze us and holds us back."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2455744,2460331,But the fear of failure is a habit which can be counteracted by the habit of courage.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2460749,2466213,"And if we don't overcome that fear of failure,  then we will just be like the 80 90% that do not fulfill their potential."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2466213,2473971,"See, the wonderful thing is only a few percentage of people fulfill their potential in any generation.  And we can join those people simply by deciding to do so and doing what the other people do."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2474555,2479351,"As simple as that, if we decide to become an engineer, what do you study? You study engineering.  You want to become a better cook, what do you do?"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2479810,2487692,"You study cooking, you try to do it all by yourself? No. You get cookbooks, you take classes and so on and so forth.  If you want to be successful, if you want to fulfill your potential study, the men and women"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2487860,2497745,"who are fulfilling their potential and just do what they do.  And finally, with regard to courage, the great expression of courage is to persist in the face of adversity."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2498037,2503375,But to persist when things really get rough. To be able to pick yourself up and pick yourself up over and over again.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2503542,2509672,"And believe me, if you decide to go for the goal in your life,  you're gonna get knocked down over and over and over and over again."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2509924,2514720,"Every single week, you're going to have heartaches  and disappointments and frustrations and setbacks and obstacles."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2515054,2521893,"But without those obstacles, no success is possible.  You see, the only way we can be successful is if we develop momentum."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2522102,2529567,And we cannot develop the momentum unless we are struggling with obstacles  and struggle with adversity goes hand in hand with all great success.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2529985,2537243,"What most people do is they back away from adversity.  But if you want to see if you're a brave person, what they call the 4:00 in the morning courage,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2538035,2544500,"wait when things go completely to pieces, when things are the worst,  when your very best deal falls apart and your rent is late"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2544667,2553424,"and you're tired and you're sick and everybody is mad at you and your car doesn't work,  then it's the person that picks themself up and says, “Nothing is going to stop me”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2553759,2562350,"You know the best quality in the world that you can develop, and I give it to you,  because I made it my life's habit to develop this. I hope I've got it, I don't know for sure."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2562560,2568107,"But the quality is to develop the quality of being unstoppable, develop the quality of being unstoppable."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2568274,2575739,"Say in yourself that no matter what life throws at me, it'll never stop me.  No matter how rough it gets, I will never quit and nothing will ever stop me."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2575948,2584455,"Make the decision that you can be tired, you can be worn out, but nothing is ever going to stop you.  That's a wonderful decision. Because then no matter what life throws at you, you pick yourself up."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2584665,2590796,"And you say, “Okay, give it”. You know, “Give it your best shot”, as Fonzie says,  Nothing is going to stop you. It's a wonderful feeling."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2591046,2598387,It's a wonderful feeling. It's the basis of self-esteem.  Confidence comes as a result of everything else.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2598637,2605561,"If you do all the things that we've talked about, if you concentrate on becoming excellent,  concentrate single mindedly, be clear about your goals,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2605769,2614485,"consider other people, practice the Golden Rule, if you practice courage,  if you practice consistency, if you practice all of these, then pretty soon you develop a level of self-confidence."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2614486,2621535,"See, confidence comes as a result. You don't get confidence out of a bottle, you don't get confidence from a pill.  You can't learn confidence in a motivational seminar."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2621785,2627833,You only get confidence by doing certain things over and over again  that build a solid foundation within your own mind
RQdbmtBJT6U,2628125,2632963,"that you can do whatever you need to do, that you have what it takes to be successful."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2633172,2637968,Self-doubt is the great paralyzer of all activity. We all have self-doubt.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2638302,2645058,"And the way we overcome that self-doubt is by doing the things that we would normally back away from.  As I say, Continue to move forward."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2645684,2652483,Self-confidence begets great achievement. You cannot imagine a successful person with lack in self-confidence.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2652775,2658614,"That the wonderful thing is this and I learned this from a very great man who died recently, is that if you persist"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2659198,2664703,until you succeed at achieving a goal that is important to you and you complete it like a degree in school
RQdbmtBJT6U,2664912,2672628,"or you wrap up a sale or you make a career successful,  you plug into your subconscious mind a success pattern."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2673003,2681804,"And then the subconscious mind running on the basis of inertia  attempts to adjust your words, actions and feelings to duplicate that success pattern."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2682096,2688185,And that's why they say nothing succeeds like success. That once you've been successful you have a pattern set down
RQdbmtBJT6U,2688394,2695942,"which will enable you to apply that pattern to another part of your work to be successful in that.  And the more you succeed, the more this pattern of success is reinforced."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2696110,2704576,And you finally reach the point where it's impossible for you to fail if you succeed enough times.  Because you will have within you a self-adjusting mechanism that will guarantee your success.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2704785,2709872,"Behave confidently as Dorothea Brande wrote in 1935 in her wonderful book, Wake Up and Live."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2710082,2718799,"She said, The key to success is this: She said,  “Go confidently in the direction of your dreams, act as though it were impossible to fail”."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2719299,2727474,"Go confidently in the direction of your dreams, and act as though it were impossible to fail.  And this brings us to the most important part, if I can just summarize in one minute."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2727975,2733814,"It is this, is that your true beliefs are only and always expressed in your actions."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2734189,2740946,"It is not what you say or what you intend that tells what you believe, but only what you do.  Your actions are always the true measure."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2741196,2749370,"And the interesting thing that we've learned in behavioral psychology is this that if you do not feel  self-confident, courageous, consistent by concentrating clear and so on,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2749538,2756378,"if you don't feel like it and most of a start off not feeling like it,  if you will act the part, if you will pretend as though you have the quality already,"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2756712,2764178,"the feelings will generate the actions and the actions will generate the feelings.  That if you will act, walk, talk, and live by the same principles"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2764178,2770641,"and do the same things that successful men and women do,  even if you doubt yourself in the initial stages, eventually you will come to the point"
RQdbmtBJT6U,2770893,2780819,"where you actually feel to the bottom of your soul  like a successful, positive, confident, cheerful, optimistic, unstoppable human being."
RQdbmtBJT6U,2781153,2790369,And that's the key. Act the part until you feel the part.  Do what successful people do and do it over and over again until it becomes ingrained as a habit.
RQdbmtBJT6U,2790662,2795209,And then you wake up one morning and you will be the success that you dream of.
