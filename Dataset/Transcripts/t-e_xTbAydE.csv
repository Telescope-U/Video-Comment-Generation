t-e_xTbAydE,833,2551,[meat grinding] [water dripping]
t-e_xTbAydE,2551,5070,[upbeat music]
t-e_xTbAydE,5070,7230,"- Hi, I'm Emily, and I'm a level 1, chef."
t-e_xTbAydE,7230,9809,"- Hi, I'm Lorenzo, and I'm a level 2 chef."
t-e_xTbAydE,9810,10920,"- Hi, I'm Frank Proto,"
t-e_xTbAydE,10920,13535,and I've been a professional chef for 27 years.
t-e_xTbAydE,13535,15809,[upbeat drums]
t-e_xTbAydE,15810,17970,- A lot of pasta Bolognese is like an all day
t-e_xTbAydE,17970,19380,Sunday sauce kind of thing.
t-e_xTbAydE,19380,22164,"And this is really like, get in, get out, and eat dinner."
t-e_xTbAydE,22164,22997,[Emily laughs]
t-e_xTbAydE,22997,27330,- This recipe is the only recipe my mom knows how to make.
t-e_xTbAydE,27330,30660,This sauce was a savior feeding all these kids every week.
t-e_xTbAydE,30660,32369,- One of the best times I've had a Bolognese
t-e_xTbAydE,32369,35430,"is I was on a trip with my wife, we were in Bologna."
t-e_xTbAydE,35430,36480,"That's what I'm chasing today,"
t-e_xTbAydE,36480,38853,is that perfect bowl of pasta I had in Bologna.
t-e_xTbAydE,41718,44385,[bells dinging]
t-e_xTbAydE,45900,47970,- I'm gonna start by making the Bolognese sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,47970,50250,So the base of my Bolognese is a mirepoix.
t-e_xTbAydE,50250,53010,"- It's the trio of vegetables or the sofrito,"
t-e_xTbAydE,53010,54359,as the Italians call it.
t-e_xTbAydE,54360,55193,- That's-
t-e_xTbAydE,55193,56550,"- [All] Celery, carrots, and onions."
t-e_xTbAydE,56550,57630,- Now the onions and the carrots
t-e_xTbAydE,57630,59010,"are gonna give a little bit of sweetness,"
t-e_xTbAydE,59010,60149,a little bit of earthiness.
t-e_xTbAydE,60150,61800,The celery gives a little sharpness
t-e_xTbAydE,61800,63899,and takes away some of that acidity.
t-e_xTbAydE,63900,66030,What this gives us is a nice baseline of the sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,66030,68760,First thing I like to do is get my onions out of the way.
t-e_xTbAydE,68760,69990,"What I do is I take my onion,"
t-e_xTbAydE,69990,73020,and I'm cutting across the natural line of the onion.
t-e_xTbAydE,73020,74670,"And then I just kind of go up and over,"
t-e_xTbAydE,74670,76470,"almost like you're going over the rainbow, right?"
t-e_xTbAydE,76470,78900,"- I am going to use the grater,"
t-e_xTbAydE,78900,81630,it just incorporates in the sauce easier.
t-e_xTbAydE,81630,83579,"It'll turn translucent easier,"
t-e_xTbAydE,83580,86040,and look all the pieces are pretty uniform.
t-e_xTbAydE,86040,87840,- I'm gonna go with a little bit of a rough chop
t-e_xTbAydE,87840,89880,because I like chunks of vegetable in my sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,89880,91500,"I'm not gonna peel the carrot, it's clean."
t-e_xTbAydE,91500,93510,"- I don't peel my carrots, just wash 'em."
t-e_xTbAydE,93510,94860,- You don't really have to peel them.
t-e_xTbAydE,94860,96300,I think it just looks a little better
t-e_xTbAydE,96300,97530,in your finished sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,97530,99630,"- I'm chopping my celery,"
t-e_xTbAydE,99630,100829,because it's stringy and you don't want
t-e_xTbAydE,100830,103530,"those strings all throughout your sauce, gross."
t-e_xTbAydE,103530,106380,"- Celery I less want chunks in my sauce,"
t-e_xTbAydE,106380,107759,"and I want it to dissipate a little more,"
t-e_xTbAydE,107760,109920,"but it's also full of water, so it's gonna do that anyway."
t-e_xTbAydE,109920,111090,"All right, mirepoix all prepped."
t-e_xTbAydE,111090,113100,- Here's my mirepoix.
t-e_xTbAydE,113100,114930,"- My mirepoix's done, next thing I'm gonna do"
t-e_xTbAydE,114930,116430,is grind some lamb.
t-e_xTbAydE,116430,117810,- I've never heard of a lamb Bolognese.
t-e_xTbAydE,117810,119850,I'm not sure I'm that brave. [laughs]
t-e_xTbAydE,119850,121290,- I think lamb for Bolognese
t-e_xTbAydE,121290,123750,"is not something people expect to see,"
t-e_xTbAydE,123750,126300,"but I think for this sauce, it makes a lot of sense."
t-e_xTbAydE,126300,127830,It's gonna be super rich.
t-e_xTbAydE,127830,130380,I'm working with lamb shoulder for a few reasons.
t-e_xTbAydE,130380,133170,"It's got a really nice meat to fat ratio,"
t-e_xTbAydE,133170,135510,and fat equals flavor.
t-e_xTbAydE,135510,137189,"Okay, we're ready, let's grind."
t-e_xTbAydE,137190,139440,- I would not know where to start with grinding my own meat.
t-e_xTbAydE,139440,142110,"I'm not gonna buy a big thing of meat, grind it,"
t-e_xTbAydE,142110,144930,"clean a meat grinder, and then make pasta, you know?"
t-e_xTbAydE,144930,147239,I am making a simple ground pork Bolognese.
t-e_xTbAydE,147240,149340,- I think that ground pork is pretty good for this.
t-e_xTbAydE,149340,150690,"- If I'm just gonna use one protein,"
t-e_xTbAydE,150690,152520,"I feel like pork is great, 'cause it's fatty,"
t-e_xTbAydE,152520,154320,"and it gives you that sort of like,"
t-e_xTbAydE,154320,156450,"pasta sauce with meat vibe that you think of,"
t-e_xTbAydE,156450,158250,as like just a classic version.
t-e_xTbAydE,158250,160290,- I like using ground chicken.
t-e_xTbAydE,160290,161739,- Who's doing ground chicken?
t-e_xTbAydE,162780,163612,- Come on.
t-e_xTbAydE,163613,165210,"Ground chicken belongs in a lot of other things,"
t-e_xTbAydE,165210,167340,I'm not sure it belongs in a Bolognese.
t-e_xTbAydE,167340,169260,- You won't even know it's ground chicken.
t-e_xTbAydE,169260,171989,"- When I grind meat, I like to cut it into long strips,"
t-e_xTbAydE,171990,173370,rather than small chunks.
t-e_xTbAydE,173370,175769,You feed a long strip in and it goes through.
t-e_xTbAydE,175770,177900,"Another important thing that I like to do is,"
t-e_xTbAydE,177900,179430,have it really cold.
t-e_xTbAydE,179430,182040,It grinds so much better and a lot easier.
t-e_xTbAydE,182040,184560,"If you're gonna try and run warm meat through this,"
t-e_xTbAydE,184560,185392,it gets gummy.
t-e_xTbAydE,185393,187200,"Now that I have my lamb ground, and my mirepoix,"
t-e_xTbAydE,187200,188437,I can start assembling this sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,188437,190980,- I'm gonna start off with adding a bit of
t-e_xTbAydE,190980,191940,olive oil. - Olive oil.
t-e_xTbAydE,191940,192773,- Next thing I'm gonna do
t-e_xTbAydE,192773,194940,"is add these dried chili de Arbol,"
t-e_xTbAydE,194940,197250,which are basically just like little Cayenne peppers.
t-e_xTbAydE,197250,199050,"This is something my grandmother would do,"
t-e_xTbAydE,199050,200400,so that's why I do it.
t-e_xTbAydE,200400,201989,It's a great garnish for later on.
t-e_xTbAydE,201990,204300,"Once they start to smell a little toasty,"
t-e_xTbAydE,204300,206580,"they come out, and we put 'em aside for later."
t-e_xTbAydE,206580,208200,- So I'm browning meat first- - Browning meat.
t-e_xTbAydE,208200,211530,- because sometimes when I've made Bolognese sauces before
t-e_xTbAydE,211530,212880,it's like too fatty and oily
t-e_xTbAydE,212880,214440,and it just like kind of breaks.
t-e_xTbAydE,214440,216270,And this helps prevent that.
t-e_xTbAydE,216270,218430,"- As the lamb cooks, it renders a lot of fat out."
t-e_xTbAydE,218430,219719,"I'm gonna strain most of it out,"
t-e_xTbAydE,219720,222267,but I'm gonna keep some of it to cook my mirepoix.
t-e_xTbAydE,222267,225900,- I'm going to throw in my grated-
t-e_xTbAydE,225900,226732,- [All] Onions.
t-e_xTbAydE,226733,229080,- [Lorenzo] Saute them to get it nice and hot.
t-e_xTbAydE,229080,229951,- [Frank] I'm gonna add my
t-e_xTbAydE,229951,230784,- garlic. - Garlic.
t-e_xTbAydE,230784,231989,- [Lorenzo] And then I'll add my-
t-e_xTbAydE,231990,232823,- [All] Carrots.
t-e_xTbAydE,232823,234330,"- [Lorenzo] Yum, yum carrots."
t-e_xTbAydE,234330,235350,- [All] Celery.
t-e_xTbAydE,235350,237330,- [Lorenzo] Counterbalances my spiciness
t-e_xTbAydE,237330,238620,that I'm gonna be adding.
t-e_xTbAydE,238620,242459,I'm gonna go ahead and add my oregano and salt.
t-e_xTbAydE,242460,245370,"All right, I'm gonna transfer into a bowl,"
t-e_xTbAydE,245370,247260,"and then start with a clean slate,"
t-e_xTbAydE,247260,249000,and start browning my meats.
t-e_xTbAydE,249000,251160,A lot of Bolognese has pancetta.
t-e_xTbAydE,251160,253050,"Well, no, not me."
t-e_xTbAydE,253050,255780,"I'm going to use hot pork sausage,"
t-e_xTbAydE,255780,258840,'cause I love the spice and the oils that come out of this.
t-e_xTbAydE,258840,260699,Get my chicken in.
t-e_xTbAydE,260700,263970,Ground chicken is not the go to for a Bolognese sauce
t-e_xTbAydE,263970,266430,for the general public. [laughs]
t-e_xTbAydE,266430,267449,- I don't know like what's the chicken
t-e_xTbAydE,267450,268380,bringing to the party there?
t-e_xTbAydE,268380,269213,You know what I mean?
t-e_xTbAydE,269213,271920,"- But when I add it into my hot sausage,"
t-e_xTbAydE,271920,274860,it'll kinda mimic the spices.
t-e_xTbAydE,274860,276330,You will never notice.
t-e_xTbAydE,276330,277949,"- All right, so I've added my pork back in"
t-e_xTbAydE,277950,279930,and now I'm just gonna like give it a little mash.
t-e_xTbAydE,279930,281160,So I'm adding salt.
t-e_xTbAydE,281160,282900,- [Lorenzo] Red pepper flakes
t-e_xTbAydE,282900,283793,- [Emily] And I like a lot of
t-e_xTbAydE,283793,285300,pepper. - Pepper.
t-e_xTbAydE,285300,286770,- So we got some oregano here.
t-e_xTbAydE,286770,288270,"A lot of recipes call for bacon,"
t-e_xTbAydE,288270,289740,"but I don't always have bacon in the house,"
t-e_xTbAydE,289740,291660,and I kind of feel like smoked paprika
t-e_xTbAydE,291660,294330,"brings some of that bacony-ness when you don't have bacon,"
t-e_xTbAydE,294330,295740,and this is like always on my shelf.
t-e_xTbAydE,295740,297180,- And now I'm gonna add anchovy.
t-e_xTbAydE,297180,298229,- I love anchovies.
t-e_xTbAydE,298230,299700,- This has been a secret ingredient
t-e_xTbAydE,299700,301560,of Italian grandmas everywhere.
t-e_xTbAydE,301560,304080,And they're basically gonna melt into the sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,304080,306210,"- I've never heard of it, but I bet it would be good,"
t-e_xTbAydE,306210,308669,"kind of salty, umami, fishy?"
t-e_xTbAydE,308670,311490,"- Anchovies aren't gonna make my sauce taste fishy,"
t-e_xTbAydE,311490,314340,"they're just gonna give it this really nice richness,"
t-e_xTbAydE,314340,315900,like lift or oomph.
t-e_xTbAydE,315900,316733,- The next thing I'm gonna do
t-e_xTbAydE,316733,319950,is actually add in my tomato paste and tomato sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,319950,322110,"- Sure, you can use tomato paste,"
t-e_xTbAydE,322110,326819,"but Passata is uncooked fresh peeled tomatoes,"
t-e_xTbAydE,326820,327810,"with no preservatives,."
t-e_xTbAydE,327810,328830,Win-win.
t-e_xTbAydE,328830,330569,- I don't even know what Passata is.
t-e_xTbAydE,330570,332970,- This tomato paste is directly from Italy.
t-e_xTbAydE,332970,334410,Sometimes you get a tinny flavor
t-e_xTbAydE,334410,336240,from the tomato paste in cans.
t-e_xTbAydE,336240,337949,This stuff in the jar is a little bit better.
t-e_xTbAydE,337950,338940,- So I'm just using like
t-e_xTbAydE,338940,340830,"regular canned tomato paste from the store,"
t-e_xTbAydE,340830,341909,you get a good amount of it.
t-e_xTbAydE,341910,343680,A lot of times it's less than a dollar.
t-e_xTbAydE,343680,345960,And then tomato sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,345960,349560,"- I'm going to add back in my lovely sofrito,"
t-e_xTbAydE,349560,351690,or my mirepoix.
t-e_xTbAydE,351690,353970,And I'm gonna add white wine.
t-e_xTbAydE,353970,356640,- I'm using the red wine to de-glaze my pan.
t-e_xTbAydE,356640,359370,It's gonna give a nice acidity to my sauce
t-e_xTbAydE,359370,360570,"- Even if it calls for red wine,"
t-e_xTbAydE,360570,362340,"I like to cook with white wine,"
t-e_xTbAydE,362340,365100,because I do like the taste of white wines.
t-e_xTbAydE,365100,368010,"So, you know, you cook with what you like to drink as well."
t-e_xTbAydE,368010,371250,"- You could use white wine for this, it's totally up to you."
t-e_xTbAydE,371250,373080,The sauce will be a little bit lighter.
t-e_xTbAydE,373080,375389,"And I think that the red wine compliments it,"
t-e_xTbAydE,375390,376890,a little bit better than a white.
t-e_xTbAydE,376890,379140,The wine is nice and cooked off.
t-e_xTbAydE,379140,380460,"I don't smell any alcohol anymore,"
t-e_xTbAydE,380460,381960,and the lamb can go back in.
t-e_xTbAydE,381960,383520,And then I'm gonna add my chicken stock.
t-e_xTbAydE,383520,384930,"While I'm waiting, what I'm gonna do"
t-e_xTbAydE,384930,388320,"is make a bouquet garni, which is a very fancy way of saying"
t-e_xTbAydE,388320,390540,I'm gonna bundle some herbs together and tie them.
t-e_xTbAydE,390540,394710,"I have basil, oregano, some rosemary, and some bay leaf."
t-e_xTbAydE,394710,396060,"I'm gonna add my bouquet garni,"
t-e_xTbAydE,396060,398250,"so that the sauce has the flavor of the herbs,"
t-e_xTbAydE,398250,400380,but the herbs aren't part of the sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,400380,401310,You're not gonna eat them.
t-e_xTbAydE,401310,404160,- So my sauce has been cooking for about 30 minutes.
t-e_xTbAydE,404160,406500,It has thickened up beautifully.
t-e_xTbAydE,406500,409380,So I'm adding pepperoni to give my Bolognese
t-e_xTbAydE,409380,410520,another kick of spice.
t-e_xTbAydE,410520,413190,"- Add like a cup of chicken broth, and a splash of milk."
t-e_xTbAydE,413190,415650,"I add milk because it adds a little bit of creaminess,"
t-e_xTbAydE,415650,417690,and like a little extra like depth of flavor.
t-e_xTbAydE,417690,419640,- And I'm adding ricotta to give my sauce
t-e_xTbAydE,419640,420960,a little bit of creaminess.
t-e_xTbAydE,420960,422759,"- Ooh, ricotta would be nice."
t-e_xTbAydE,422760,425130,"Yeah if you've got ricotta in the house, go for it."
t-e_xTbAydE,425130,427560,"Then maybe bring it to my house, please."
t-e_xTbAydE,427560,430919,- Ricotta is a fantastic substitute for milk.
t-e_xTbAydE,430920,433500,"It's gonna give it more of a creaminess,"
t-e_xTbAydE,433500,435600,and thickness to your sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,435600,438300,"- Parmesan rinds, it's gonna give my sauce"
t-e_xTbAydE,438300,441780,a great cheese flavor without adding cheese to the sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,441780,443190,- And I'm gonna add some bay leaves.
t-e_xTbAydE,443190,445260,"So I'm gonna let this simmer for like 15, 20 minutes."
t-e_xTbAydE,445260,448110,"- So I'm gonna let my sauce gently cook down,"
t-e_xTbAydE,448110,449729,for another 30 minutes.
t-e_xTbAydE,449730,451950,- My Bolognese is cooked for about an hour.
t-e_xTbAydE,451950,454410,"It's reduced, it looks rich."
t-e_xTbAydE,454410,457500,I'm taking out my Parmesan rinds and my bouquet garni.
t-e_xTbAydE,457500,459990,"They've done their work, they've flavored my sauce,"
t-e_xTbAydE,459990,462360,and now I don't need them anymore.
t-e_xTbAydE,462360,464099,"They're no good to me, throw 'em away."
t-e_xTbAydE,464100,466170,- So the next thing I'm gonna do is make my pasta.
t-e_xTbAydE,466170,467610,I'm using box spaghetti.
t-e_xTbAydE,467610,469469,"It goes well with everything, it tastes good."
t-e_xTbAydE,469470,470400,It's easy to make.
t-e_xTbAydE,470400,474240,- I absolutely prefer fresh pasta to box pasta.
t-e_xTbAydE,474240,475860,"Any sauce that you put to it,"
t-e_xTbAydE,475860,479189,doesn't exactly absorb into the pasta as easily.
t-e_xTbAydE,479190,482250,I love using tagliatelle pasta.
t-e_xTbAydE,482250,485820,"A beautiful, flat, not majorly wide noodle."
t-e_xTbAydE,485820,488893,I've got a beautiful pot of boiling water.
t-e_xTbAydE,488893,490470,Ah!
t-e_xTbAydE,490470,491303,That was hot.
t-e_xTbAydE,491303,492990,"- I'm making a handmade orecchiette,"
t-e_xTbAydE,492990,494940,which basically means little ears.
t-e_xTbAydE,494940,498450,"I prefer to do handmade pasta, I feel like it's a dying art,"
t-e_xTbAydE,498450,499800,and I want to kind of bring it back.
t-e_xTbAydE,499800,501090,The texture is better.
t-e_xTbAydE,501090,502650,That'll hold your sauce really well.
t-e_xTbAydE,502650,504540,"The pasta I'm making is a semolina dough,"
t-e_xTbAydE,504540,506040,it's basically four ingredients.
t-e_xTbAydE,506040,508830,Semolina flour is made from a hundred percent durum wheat.
t-e_xTbAydE,508830,510930,"It makes a nice firm, chewy pasta."
t-e_xTbAydE,510930,513000,Double zero flour gives my pasta
t-e_xTbAydE,513000,514500,"a little bit of that silkiness,"
t-e_xTbAydE,514500,517536,everything needs salt for flavor and just some water.
t-e_xTbAydE,517536,520169,I'm gonna add my salt to the water just to dissolve it.
t-e_xTbAydE,520169,522240,"I just find that I get better dispersion of the salt,"
t-e_xTbAydE,522240,523370,when I add it to the water.
t-e_xTbAydE,523370,525750,- So the first thing I need to do is salt my water.
t-e_xTbAydE,525750,528270,"- Pretty generous, sea salt, not crazy,"
t-e_xTbAydE,528270,531180,'cause I'm gonna also be using this water
t-e_xTbAydE,531180,534899,to incorporate in the sauce later as well.
t-e_xTbAydE,534900,537510,"- And I'm just going to dump in my spaghetti,"
t-e_xTbAydE,537510,538770,"and then I wanna like break it up a little,"
t-e_xTbAydE,538770,540060,so it doesn't all stick together.
t-e_xTbAydE,540060,542340,"- Anytime I cooking fresh pasta,"
t-e_xTbAydE,542340,547340,"I always constantly stir the pot, because it will stick."
t-e_xTbAydE,547920,552690,"- I'm looking for a soft pliable dough that isn't super dry,"
t-e_xTbAydE,552690,554250,"because when I stretch it out,"
t-e_xTbAydE,554250,555930,I want it to grab my board a little.
t-e_xTbAydE,555930,558480,"Now that the dough is not wet and sticky anymore,"
t-e_xTbAydE,558480,559949,and it's starting to come together.
t-e_xTbAydE,559950,561600,I'm gonna just dump it out into my board.
t-e_xTbAydE,561600,563490,Then I'm just gonna start to pull it together.
t-e_xTbAydE,563490,566279,So I'm just gathering all of the flour together
t-e_xTbAydE,566280,569250,to form a ball of dough.
t-e_xTbAydE,569250,571500,"When I press the dough and it bounces back,"
t-e_xTbAydE,571500,574080,"that means I have some decent gluten development,"
t-e_xTbAydE,574080,575280,and that's all that I'm looking for.
t-e_xTbAydE,575280,576270,I'm gonna wrap my dough
t-e_xTbAydE,576270,578190,and let it rest for about 20 minutes.
t-e_xTbAydE,578190,580320,"- I'm gonna let this boil, I wanna say like 12 minutes."
t-e_xTbAydE,580320,582300,I will double check the package.
t-e_xTbAydE,582300,583529,The nice thing about box spaghetti
t-e_xTbAydE,583530,585120,is it tells you what to do.
t-e_xTbAydE,585120,585953,10 to 12 minutes.
t-e_xTbAydE,585953,588750,"We'll go on the 10 side, maybe even nine."
t-e_xTbAydE,588750,590730,- So I'm gonna boil this fresh pasta
t-e_xTbAydE,590730,592199,"for about two to three minutes,"
t-e_xTbAydE,592200,595740,"so it gets a nice chew to it, and it's not mushy."
t-e_xTbAydE,595740,597570,- Now it's time to roll these pastas out.
t-e_xTbAydE,597570,599670,"I don't want my cutting board to be floured at this point,"
t-e_xTbAydE,599670,602880,because when I squish this down and pull it
t-e_xTbAydE,602880,604260,"to make the orecchiette shape,"
t-e_xTbAydE,604260,607140,I want my cutting board to hold on to the pasta.
t-e_xTbAydE,607140,610860,"So I get it around my finger, I open it up around my thumb,"
t-e_xTbAydE,610860,613680,and then I have a really nice orecchiette shape.
t-e_xTbAydE,613680,615600,"- I've never seen orecchiette with Bolognese,"
t-e_xTbAydE,615600,616860,but I bet it works.
t-e_xTbAydE,616860,619200,- They're wonderful for holding sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,619200,621390,"They have a little bit of a cup on the inside,"
t-e_xTbAydE,621390,624030,"and on the other side, they have a little bit of a dome,"
t-e_xTbAydE,624030,626823,that has all these little ridges that grab onto the sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,626823,629670,"Just kind of relaxing and mesmerizing, right?"
t-e_xTbAydE,629670,632160,"- The way that I check my pasta, other than tasting it,"
t-e_xTbAydE,632160,635339,is like you can kind of pick it up and see how floppy it is.
t-e_xTbAydE,635340,636540,"This isn't quite there yet,"
t-e_xTbAydE,636540,638730,and you can tell 'cause it doesn't fully flop.
t-e_xTbAydE,638730,639779,This is pretty close.
t-e_xTbAydE,639780,641010,- Let's get outta the water.
t-e_xTbAydE,641010,642180,Outta the water!
t-e_xTbAydE,642180,644700,- I would say that this pasta is ready to go.
t-e_xTbAydE,644700,646950,It's very floppy now and ready to ride.
t-e_xTbAydE,646950,649170,Now I'm gonna drain my pasta.
t-e_xTbAydE,649170,650003,All right.
t-e_xTbAydE,651540,652373,Eep.
t-e_xTbAydE,652373,653640,"Oh God, I'm so clumsy."
t-e_xTbAydE,653640,656310,I feel like I can hear like bumbling music as I do this.
t-e_xTbAydE,656310,659670,"You know, like as I keep dropping noodles. [laughs]"
t-e_xTbAydE,659670,661920,"- So I'm gonna save some of this pasta water,"
t-e_xTbAydE,661920,663089,"for when I plate,"
t-e_xTbAydE,663090,665283,so I can get a nice consistency of the sauce
t-e_xTbAydE,665283,667080,that I'm actually looking for.
t-e_xTbAydE,667080,669870,- I'm gonna cook this pasta once my sauce is ready.
t-e_xTbAydE,669870,671070,Fresh pasta definitely takes
t-e_xTbAydE,671070,672840,less time to cook than dry pasta.
t-e_xTbAydE,672840,675180,"It's fairly dense, so it might not take 10 minutes."
t-e_xTbAydE,675180,676600,It'll probably take six or seven.
t-e_xTbAydE,676600,678449,- And now I'm ready to put it all together.
t-e_xTbAydE,678450,680160,- I have a pot of boiling water here.
t-e_xTbAydE,680160,681990,I want this to be sea salty.
t-e_xTbAydE,681990,684690,"I'm gonna throw my pasta in, just all at once."
t-e_xTbAydE,684690,687570,"Give it a quick stir, so it's not sticking to the bottom,"
t-e_xTbAydE,687570,689250,and then I can heat my sauce up.
t-e_xTbAydE,689250,692580,"You want to have just enough sauce, to coat your pasta."
t-e_xTbAydE,692580,694200,It's almost like dressing a salad.
t-e_xTbAydE,694200,695880,"I'm gonna take a little bit of my basil,"
t-e_xTbAydE,695880,697200,and I'm just gonna tear that in here
t-e_xTbAydE,697200,699720,for a little bit of brightness and freshness.
t-e_xTbAydE,699720,701670,"Because I made fresh pasta,"
t-e_xTbAydE,701670,703200,I want to have everything ready to go.
t-e_xTbAydE,703200,704730,I don't want this pasta to sit at all.
t-e_xTbAydE,704730,708000,"I want it to go directly from the water, into the sauce."
t-e_xTbAydE,708000,710130,So that I keep that nice chewy texture.
t-e_xTbAydE,710130,712083,"- So, take some of my pasta."
t-e_xTbAydE,713010,717840,- I'm gonna combine my beautiful tagliatelle fresh pasta.
t-e_xTbAydE,717840,719370,"Whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops."
t-e_xTbAydE,719370,720203,"- [Emily] Here, we're gonna put a little"
t-e_xTbAydE,720203,721036,pasta water in here. - Pasta water.
t-e_xTbAydE,721036,723360,- [Emily] Just to loosen everything up.
t-e_xTbAydE,723360,724529,- [Frank] My pasta is cooked
t-e_xTbAydE,724530,727140,"about 3/4 of the way right now,"
t-e_xTbAydE,727140,729750,and I'm just gonna let it finish in the sauce.
t-e_xTbAydE,729750,730860,"And what's gonna happen here,"
t-e_xTbAydE,730860,732560,is that the starch from the pasta
t-e_xTbAydE,732560,734370,"is gonna help thicken my sauce a little,"
t-e_xTbAydE,734370,736380,and let it coat a little bit better.
t-e_xTbAydE,736380,740700,- So now my pasta and my meat sauce are perfectly combined.
t-e_xTbAydE,740700,742140,I'm gonna plate it up.
t-e_xTbAydE,742140,746130,"It looks so good, I just got this kid smile on my face."
t-e_xTbAydE,746130,748080,- This is a nice portion of pasta.
t-e_xTbAydE,748080,750450,You generally tend to put a big bowl of pasta
t-e_xTbAydE,750450,752340,"in front of people, you don't need any more."
t-e_xTbAydE,752340,754710,"The sauce is super rich, the pasta's dense."
t-e_xTbAydE,754710,757050,So I don't wanna have a huge bowl of pasta.
t-e_xTbAydE,757050,758130,"- Next up, garnish."
t-e_xTbAydE,758130,761700,"- So I'm garnishing my pasta with grated Parmesan,"
t-e_xTbAydE,761700,762900,the real stuff.
t-e_xTbAydE,762900,766320,"- So I'm just gonna take a little bit of Pecorino Romano,"
t-e_xTbAydE,766320,767760,"it's super sharp,"
t-e_xTbAydE,767760,770460,and I'm gonna put a little Parmesan on too.
t-e_xTbAydE,770460,772500,Parmesan is much more nutty.
t-e_xTbAydE,772500,774150,"- I'm using a shaker of Parmesan cheese,"
t-e_xTbAydE,774150,776460,"just because it's easy to get, it lasts forever."
t-e_xTbAydE,776460,777660,One always has it around.
t-e_xTbAydE,777660,779519,- I call those Pringles cheeses.
t-e_xTbAydE,779520,780600,- The kind that's on the shelf
t-e_xTbAydE,780600,782069,and who knows how long it's been there.
t-e_xTbAydE,782070,784020,I also have fresh parsley.
t-e_xTbAydE,784020,785250,"- [Emily] I have chopped parsley,"
t-e_xTbAydE,785250,787560,I just think it adds a nice little bit of freshness.
t-e_xTbAydE,787560,788580,"You know, it's simple."
t-e_xTbAydE,788580,791100,"- I prefer the basil, but parsley, that's pretty good."
t-e_xTbAydE,791100,793680,"- [Lorenzo] And beautiful, fresh basil."
t-e_xTbAydE,793680,795810,"- I'm crumbling the fried Chile de Arbol on top,"
t-e_xTbAydE,795810,796680,for a little bit of heat.
t-e_xTbAydE,796680,798990,"- Go for it, I love spicy food"
t-e_xTbAydE,798990,800880,- And this is my spaghetti Bolognese.
t-e_xTbAydE,800880,802380,[picture snapping]
t-e_xTbAydE,802380,805413,- And this is my spicy pasta Bolognese.
t-e_xTbAydE,805413,806880,[picture snapping]
t-e_xTbAydE,806880,810029,- And this is my lamb Bolognese with handmade orecchiette.
t-e_xTbAydE,810029,812065,[picture snapping]
t-e_xTbAydE,812065,815148,[lighthearted music]
t-e_xTbAydE,816180,817200,- I'm very excited to eat this.
t-e_xTbAydE,817200,818130,"It's like, it's classic."
t-e_xTbAydE,818130,819360,- It's gonna be ugly.
t-e_xTbAydE,819360,820193,Let's do it.
t-e_xTbAydE,822721,825480,[Emily laughs]
t-e_xTbAydE,825480,826680,- That works.
t-e_xTbAydE,826680,831210,- But that chewy beautiful bite of a pasta
t-e_xTbAydE,831210,833460,is just heaven.
t-e_xTbAydE,833460,835290,- One of the things that sticks out to me right away
t-e_xTbAydE,835290,839820,"is that the meat is super rich, but it's not super strong."
t-e_xTbAydE,839820,843540,"The pasta, like I said, holds on to the sauce."
t-e_xTbAydE,843540,845430,That is exactly what I wanted it to do.
t-e_xTbAydE,845430,847350,- You're good. I love you.
t-e_xTbAydE,847350,849420,"- It's a perfectly good weeknight Bolognese,"
t-e_xTbAydE,849420,850620,and what did it take me?
t-e_xTbAydE,850620,852330,"Half an hour, maybe 45 minutes."
t-e_xTbAydE,852330,856092,"- Go away, don't watch me while I eat. [laughs]"
t-e_xTbAydE,856092,857699,[dramatic boom]
t-e_xTbAydE,857700,859590,- Pasta Bolognese is a pasta dish
t-e_xTbAydE,859590,862740,"served with a slowly cooked aromatic thick meat sauce,"
t-e_xTbAydE,862740,865860,"named for the place that made it famous, Bologna Italy."
t-e_xTbAydE,865860,868234,Let's see how each of our chefs made theirs.
t-e_xTbAydE,868234,871320,[dramatic music]
t-e_xTbAydE,871320,873570,Emily used pork in her Bolognese.
t-e_xTbAydE,873570,876750,Pork is the meat of hogs and is typically lighter in color
t-e_xTbAydE,876750,879210,"because of a lower myoglobin concentration,"
t-e_xTbAydE,879210,881340,which is the oxygen rich biomolecule
t-e_xTbAydE,881340,882840,that gives meat its color.
t-e_xTbAydE,882840,885510,"Lorenzo used a combination of ground chicken,"
t-e_xTbAydE,885510,887100,and hot Italian sausage.
t-e_xTbAydE,887100,888930,"Ground chicken is a mild meat,"
t-e_xTbAydE,888930,891960,"but the addition of hot spicy Italian sausage,"
t-e_xTbAydE,891960,895260,gave a really nice flavor combination to his Bolognese.
t-e_xTbAydE,895260,897810,Frank used lamb that he freshly ground.
t-e_xTbAydE,897810,899160,"Grinding meat yourself,"
t-e_xTbAydE,899160,901500,means that you're not consuming a combination of meats
t-e_xTbAydE,901500,902790,"from various animals,"
t-e_xTbAydE,902790,905196,as may be the case with commercial ground meat.
t-e_xTbAydE,905197,908430,[dramatic music]
t-e_xTbAydE,908430,911640,Emily made her Bolognese with a classic milk base.
t-e_xTbAydE,911640,913560,"Instead of the traditional milk,"
t-e_xTbAydE,913560,916890,"Lorenzo added ricotta, which is not a true cheese,"
t-e_xTbAydE,916890,919680,in that it isn't made from casein proteins from the milk.
t-e_xTbAydE,919680,922800,"Traditionally, it was made from the watery byproduct"
t-e_xTbAydE,922800,925440,"of making cheese curds, which is twice heated,"
t-e_xTbAydE,925440,926880,"which promoted coagulation,"
t-e_xTbAydE,926880,929070,and precipitation of the proteins in the whey.
t-e_xTbAydE,929070,931770,Which were then scooped out and called ricotta.
t-e_xTbAydE,931770,935190,"Frank elevated his Bolognese by using a Parmesan rind,"
t-e_xTbAydE,935190,938280,"from the thick outer portion of a wheel of cheese,"
t-e_xTbAydE,938280,940080,which is a great way to use something
t-e_xTbAydE,940080,942180,that might otherwise get thrown out.
t-e_xTbAydE,942180,944310,"Adding dairy in the form of a cheese rind,"
t-e_xTbAydE,944310,946440,"adds saltiness and aids in thickening,"
t-e_xTbAydE,946440,947580,because of the additional
t-e_xTbAydE,947580,950037,concentrated proteins and starches.
t-e_xTbAydE,950037,953339,[dramatic music]
t-e_xTbAydE,953340,956850,"Emily used a box of dried spaghetti, made with semolina."
t-e_xTbAydE,956850,960360,"Spaghetti is extruded through dies, dried, boxed,"
t-e_xTbAydE,960360,961709,and ready to use.
t-e_xTbAydE,961710,964290,Lorenzo used fresh tagliatelle.
t-e_xTbAydE,964290,967500,"Fresh tagliatelle is made with flour, eggs,"
t-e_xTbAydE,967500,969270,and sometimes additional yolks.
t-e_xTbAydE,969270,972090,"It's soft, and supple, and cooks very quickly,"
