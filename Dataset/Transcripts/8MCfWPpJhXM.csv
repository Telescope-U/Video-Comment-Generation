8MCfWPpJhXM,560,2480,whenever you travel in a train you might
8MCfWPpJhXM,2480,4080,have seen these hanging weights near the
8MCfWPpJhXM,4080,6000,poles and a strange connection of wires
8MCfWPpJhXM,6000,7279,near to them
8MCfWPpJhXM,7279,8960,what exactly are they
8MCfWPpJhXM,8960,10400,why couldn't they just use a simple
8MCfWPpJhXM,10400,12639,conductive wire arrangement similar to
8MCfWPpJhXM,12639,15120,the normal power transmission system
8MCfWPpJhXM,15120,17199,let's explore this topic
8MCfWPpJhXM,17199,19199,in this simple case both ends of the
8MCfWPpJhXM,19199,23039,wire are fixed as shown
8MCfWPpJhXM,23119,24880,temperature variations will cause big
8MCfWPpJhXM,24880,26960,problems in this design
8MCfWPpJhXM,26960,28800,in the summer time as the temperature
8MCfWPpJhXM,28800,31679,increases the material will expand
8MCfWPpJhXM,31679,33680,since the ends are fixed this will
8MCfWPpJhXM,33680,36559,result in sagging of the wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,36559,39760,and sagging wires are free to deform
8MCfWPpJhXM,39760,41920,due to this the wire will go for a wave
8MCfWPpJhXM,41920,43440,kind of movement
8MCfWPpJhXM,43440,44960,there is a chance of sparks being
8MCfWPpJhXM,44960,47360,produced and the pantograph may even get
8MCfWPpJhXM,47360,49600,stuck
8MCfWPpJhXM,49600,51199,maybe you can tighten these wires too
8MCfWPpJhXM,51199,53120,much so that you can reduce the sagging
8MCfWPpJhXM,53120,54480,in the summer
8MCfWPpJhXM,54480,56960,however this wire will break during the
8MCfWPpJhXM,56960,59120,cold winter months as the material
8MCfWPpJhXM,59120,60800,contracts
8MCfWPpJhXM,60800,62719,now it is clear why fixing a wire at
8MCfWPpJhXM,62719,65518,both ends is not a good idea
8MCfWPpJhXM,65518,67840,an ideal overhead equipment setup should
8MCfWPpJhXM,67840,70000,always keep the contact wire perfectly
8MCfWPpJhXM,70000,72560,straight without breaking the wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,72560,75680,let's see how we can achieve this
8MCfWPpJhXM,75680,77759,first we must design a simple system to
8MCfWPpJhXM,77759,79280,take care of this expansion and
8MCfWPpJhXM,79280,81200,contraction problem
8MCfWPpJhXM,81200,83360,in this design we are replacing a fixed
8MCfWPpJhXM,83360,85200,connection with a pulley
8MCfWPpJhXM,85200,86799,when you attach a dead weight to this
8MCfWPpJhXM,86799,88960,free end the wire sag will be greatly
8MCfWPpJhXM,88960,90880,reduced
8MCfWPpJhXM,90880,93119,here tension in the wire is the same as
8MCfWPpJhXM,93119,95280,the weight of the discs
8MCfWPpJhXM,95280,97360,this arrangement will compensate for any
8MCfWPpJhXM,97360,99280,temperature change
8MCfWPpJhXM,99280,101439,the more the temperature increases the
8MCfWPpJhXM,101439,104880,more the weight will pull down
8MCfWPpJhXM,105520,107280,with this pulley and weight arrangement
8MCfWPpJhXM,107280,109040,can we increase the distance between the
8MCfWPpJhXM,109040,111680,poles to any extent
8MCfWPpJhXM,111680,113280,the answer is
8MCfWPpJhXM,113280,115280,no
8MCfWPpJhXM,115280,117119,although the concrete weights reduce the
8MCfWPpJhXM,117119,118719,sag of the wire they can never
8MCfWPpJhXM,118719,121520,completely eliminate the sag especially
8MCfWPpJhXM,121520,123759,when the span is too large even with a
8MCfWPpJhXM,123759,125920,good amount of disc weight the sag will
8MCfWPpJhXM,125920,127600,be considerable
8MCfWPpJhXM,127600,130399,here is an easy experiment to prove it
8MCfWPpJhXM,130399,132800,this experimental rig is exactly same as
8MCfWPpJhXM,132800,134239,og system
8MCfWPpJhXM,134239,137040,one and the cable is fixed here
8MCfWPpJhXM,137040,140239,and other end is passing over a pulley
8MCfWPpJhXM,140239,142800,you can see a good sag let's add a
8MCfWPpJhXM,142800,144239,weight and see what happened to the
8MCfWPpJhXM,144239,146560,system
8MCfWPpJhXM,148740,151779,[Music]
8MCfWPpJhXM,152160,154400,the size has decreased
8MCfWPpJhXM,154400,156400,now let's add one more weight a really
8MCfWPpJhXM,156400,159120,heavy weight
8MCfWPpJhXM,161440,164319,the stock has decreased again but not
8MCfWPpJhXM,164319,165200,zero
8MCfWPpJhXM,165200,166560,this means that
8MCfWPpJhXM,166560,168800,if you want a perfect straight line here
8MCfWPpJhXM,168800,170480,you have to have an infinite amount of
8MCfWPpJhXM,170480,173760,weight at the pulley side
8MCfWPpJhXM,173840,176080,due to this the maximum distance allowed
8MCfWPpJhXM,176080,179440,between the poles is around 50 meters
8MCfWPpJhXM,179440,181200,the solution is simple
8MCfWPpJhXM,181200,184879,introduce more support in between
8MCfWPpJhXM,184879,186319,here's the trick
8MCfWPpJhXM,186319,188319,you can see an extended cantilever in
8MCfWPpJhXM,188319,191040,these supports
8MCfWPpJhXM,191440,195440,they should be able to swing as shown
8MCfWPpJhXM,195440,196560,such that when the temperature
8MCfWPpJhXM,196560,198879,variations occur they will not block the
8MCfWPpJhXM,198879,200720,movement of the wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,200720,203280,however the last cantilever is fixed as
8MCfWPpJhXM,203280,204640,we saw earlier
8MCfWPpJhXM,204640,206959,we've developed a small wire unit or
8MCfWPpJhXM,206959,208640,overhead equipment for the electric
8MCfWPpJhXM,208640,210640,train
8MCfWPpJhXM,210640,212959,now it's time to achieve a long oag
8MCfWPpJhXM,212959,215760,system starting from this design
8MCfWPpJhXM,215760,217920,the solution is simple
8MCfWPpJhXM,217920,220879,just duplicate this entire unit and
8MCfWPpJhXM,220879,222799,start this new unit before the first
8MCfWPpJhXM,222799,225120,unit ends to maintain the electrical
8MCfWPpJhXM,225120,227840,continuity between units a few flexible
8MCfWPpJhXM,227840,230319,jumper wires are used you can see how
8MCfWPpJhXM,230319,232159,the jumper wires electrically connect
8MCfWPpJhXM,232159,235120,the first and second unit
8MCfWPpJhXM,235120,236560,we can run our electric train
8MCfWPpJhXM,236560,239040,successfully in this system you can see
8MCfWPpJhXM,239040,241280,clearly how a pantograph changes contact
8MCfWPpJhXM,241280,245439,from one ohe unit to another
8MCfWPpJhXM,246000,247680,we had a successful test run of the
8MCfWPpJhXM,247680,250000,train
8MCfWPpJhXM,251519,253599,however if you observe carefully you'll
8MCfWPpJhXM,253599,255519,notice that the contact wires are still
8MCfWPpJhXM,255519,257440,sagging a little bit
8MCfWPpJhXM,257440,259359,the disc weight and supports with swing
8MCfWPpJhXM,259359,261199,arms could not solve the sag problem
8MCfWPpJhXM,261199,262479,completely
8MCfWPpJhXM,262479,264160,can you think of a solution to fix this
8MCfWPpJhXM,264160,266000,issue once and for all
8MCfWPpJhXM,266000,267759,we'll give you one clue
8MCfWPpJhXM,267759,270080,the almost perfect straight line can be
8MCfWPpJhXM,270080,271759,achieved with the help of one more
8MCfWPpJhXM,271759,274000,pulley wire system which is placed
8MCfWPpJhXM,274000,277440,slightly above the current contact wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,277440,279600,can you spot the solution now
8MCfWPpJhXM,279600,281440,it's relatively simple
8MCfWPpJhXM,281440,283440,these two wires have the exact same
8MCfWPpJhXM,283440,285520,shape now
8MCfWPpJhXM,285520,287680,if you take a connecting wire called a
8MCfWPpJhXM,287680,290080,dropper which has the same length as the
8MCfWPpJhXM,290080,291919,distance between the wires
8MCfWPpJhXM,291919,293919,nothing will happen to their shape
8MCfWPpJhXM,293919,295759,however what would happen if we
8MCfWPpJhXM,295759,297759,connected the wires using a dropper of a
8MCfWPpJhXM,297759,300400,shorter length
8MCfWPpJhXM,300800,303039,this shorter dropper will obviously pull
8MCfWPpJhXM,303039,305759,the contact wire up
8MCfWPpJhXM,305759,308880,while pulling the upper wire down
8MCfWPpJhXM,308880,311600,in short the sag of the upper wire will
8MCfWPpJhXM,311600,313680,increase while the bottom wire will have
8MCfWPpJhXM,313680,316639,a perfect zero sag at this point the
8MCfWPpJhXM,316639,319039,upper wire is called catenary and the
8MCfWPpJhXM,319039,322479,lower wire is obviously the contact wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,322479,325039,by adding more droppers the contact wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,325039,328000,will become even straighter
8MCfWPpJhXM,328000,330240,these droppers also absorb vibrations
8MCfWPpJhXM,330240,332080,arising from the interaction between the
8MCfWPpJhXM,332080,336000,pantograph and the contact wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,336639,338800,we can simplify this system by attaching
8MCfWPpJhXM,338800,340800,the ends of both wires to the common
8MCfWPpJhXM,340800,343120,pulley
8MCfWPpJhXM,344080,346400,however the tension in the wires must be
8MCfWPpJhXM,346400,350160,the same as it was in the earlier design
8MCfWPpJhXM,350960,352400,does this mean we need to add more
8MCfWPpJhXM,352400,353600,weights
8MCfWPpJhXM,353600,357199,obviously this is not a good idea
8MCfWPpJhXM,357199,358720,let's implement a clever pulley
8MCfWPpJhXM,358720,360240,arrangement that provides an immense
8MCfWPpJhXM,360240,363039,mechanical advantage
8MCfWPpJhXM,363039,365199,a 2 newton force at the pulley gives
8MCfWPpJhXM,365199,369039,three newtons of tension in each wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,369039,371360,as you can see now the contact wire is
8MCfWPpJhXM,371360,373759,almost straight with this system the
8MCfWPpJhXM,373759,375840,pantograph always remains in contact
8MCfWPpJhXM,375840,379639,with the contact wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,380400,382479,till now we have seen that the atd is
8MCfWPpJhXM,382479,384639,attached at one end and the other end is
8MCfWPpJhXM,384639,385680,fixed
8MCfWPpJhXM,385680,387520,we saw earlier how to duplicate this
8MCfWPpJhXM,387520,391520,simple unit to achieve a long ohe
8MCfWPpJhXM,391520,394160,however before duplicating if you mirror
8MCfWPpJhXM,394160,395680,this simple design
8MCfWPpJhXM,395680,400000,the whole design will be much simpler
8MCfWPpJhXM,400479,404479,this is the final ohe design
8MCfWPpJhXM,404960,406880,from these visuals you will understand a
8MCfWPpJhXM,406880,409599,lot of details about this design
8MCfWPpJhXM,409599,411599,catenary wires are kept at the same
8MCfWPpJhXM,411599,414160,voltage as the contact wires
8MCfWPpJhXM,414160,415919,otherwise there will be current flow via
8MCfWPpJhXM,415919,421000,the droppers and unnecessary energy loss
8MCfWPpJhXM,424240,426240,additionally if there is any damage in
8MCfWPpJhXM,426240,428319,the contact wire the system will not
8MCfWPpJhXM,428319,429120,fail
8MCfWPpJhXM,429120,431360,please have a look at this jumper design
8MCfWPpJhXM,431360,432800,the jumper is passing through the
8MCfWPpJhXM,432800,434319,catenary wire
8MCfWPpJhXM,434319,436240,this means the power will be supplied by
8MCfWPpJhXM,436240,438800,the catenary wire through jumpers
8MCfWPpJhXM,438800,440800,thank you for watching the video see you
8MCfWPpJhXM,440800,444039,next time
