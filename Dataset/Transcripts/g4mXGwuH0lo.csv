g4mXGwuH0lo,4240,11120,you were made to rise  to take your pain
g4mXGwuH0lo,11120,17680,and convert it  to purpose  [Music]  to take your struggle
g4mXGwuH0lo,17680,22640,and transform it  into meaning
g4mXGwuH0lo,22880,28840,in a world of concession of self  sabotage and defeat
g4mXGwuH0lo,28840,34960,you were made to rise  [Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,34960,40800,and so it's critical  that you look around where you are now
g4mXGwuH0lo,40800,46480,and adjust your lens  it's critical that you see the present
g4mXGwuH0lo,46480,52160,moment  not as an ending  the culmination of wrong turns or broken
g4mXGwuH0lo,52160,60640,plans but as the beginning  of what all that will be turned into
g4mXGwuH0lo,60640,66720,the start of the next chapter  a new road
g4mXGwuH0lo,66720,72080,because you  were made to rise
g4mXGwuH0lo,72080,77439,life has an interesting way  of not pushing us to be more until our
g4mXGwuH0lo,77439,84720,backs are against the wall  until we've fallen  or found ourselves where we don't belong
g4mXGwuH0lo,84720,90240,but it's down in the ashes that were  presented this blessing
g4mXGwuH0lo,90240,96960,that were given the chance to be more  than we've ever been  you weren't made to look around and call
g4mXGwuH0lo,96960,102720,this diminished reality home no you
g4mXGwuH0lo,103119,110479,were made  to rise  life is about decisions what to accept
g4mXGwuH0lo,110479,116079,and what to cut away and it's in our  moments of distress
g4mXGwuH0lo,116079,121759,we must find our calm  when we feel low that we must remember
g4mXGwuH0lo,121759,128399,the heights we're capable of obtaining  look our greatest invitations they often
g4mXGwuH0lo,128399,133680,feel like defeat  like hopelessness but see beyond that
g4mXGwuH0lo,133680,140000,narrative  look in the mirror and know that what  looks back at you isn't the problem it's
g4mXGwuH0lo,140000,145280,the reason you'll succeed  someday you'll see the present as the
g4mXGwuH0lo,145280,151360,moment that made you the days that shake  you  just as a sculptor arrives at his
g4mXGwuH0lo,151360,158080,masterpiece so stand up  brush yourself off and look up
g4mXGwuH0lo,158080,166800,because that  is where you're going  now is where it begins
g4mXGwuH0lo,167120,173680,you weren't made  to accept what is  [Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,173680,179959,you  were made to rise
g4mXGwuH0lo,180500,187539,[Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,194000,199599,the miracle isn't that i finished  the miracle is that i had the courage to
g4mXGwuH0lo,199599,207200,start  john bingham  we all share a commonality
g4mXGwuH0lo,207200,212480,the runner on the starting blocks  the one at work the one studying the one
g4mXGwuH0lo,212480,218799,trying to create the best life possible  for their family see we are all at a  beginning
g4mXGwuH0lo,218799,226319,looking up at an idea  nothing given  nothing to adjust or react to know just
g4mXGwuH0lo,226319,232239,an idea  and ideas when we are at the bottom  looking up
g4mXGwuH0lo,232239,237680,they're deceptive in nature their size  their weight their breath
g4mXGwuH0lo,237680,245360,they like to present themselves  as much more than they actually are
g4mXGwuH0lo,245760,251360,and so  to turn ideas into things one needs see
g4mXGwuH0lo,251360,257120,themselves  not as some descendant of mount olympus  tasked with
g4mXGwuH0lo,257120,264240,lifting that 2000 ton boulder before  them but  as one armed with an understanding
g4mXGwuH0lo,264240,270080,the awareness that the 2000 ton boulder  before them can be broken down
g4mXGwuH0lo,270080,275440,piece by piece that it is nothing more  than a facade and while it may stop most
g4mXGwuH0lo,275440,280840,in their tracks  you are simply not
g4mXGwuH0lo,280840,286720,most not because the world treats you  differently  but because you see the world
g4mXGwuH0lo,286720,293440,differently  by knowing you are bigger than the sum  of its parts you have defanged this wolf
g4mXGwuH0lo,293440,300160,you have put yourself  in position to do that which makes the  world tremble
g4mXGwuH0lo,300160,307120,that which causes even the most  confident to doubt  you have put yourself in position to
g4mXGwuH0lo,307120,313199,begin  [Music]  see there is a time to look at the top
g4mXGwuH0lo,313199,319199,of the mountain  breaking through the clouds powerful and  majestic
g4mXGwuH0lo,319199,325680,and then there is a time to look at your  feet  and right now is the latter
g4mXGwuH0lo,325680,331039,you're not concerned with the big things  no not right now your job is to move
g4mXGwuH0lo,331039,338880,forward into this hate  to not see but adapt  to not know but trust things will
g4mXGwuH0lo,338880,344960,materialize and you know that but at the  same time you can't control the future
g4mXGwuH0lo,344960,350560,your battle  is right now and it's with the space  immediately in front of you it's with
g4mXGwuH0lo,350560,358560,the thoughts attempting to deceive you  it's with the things the outside world  will tell you but forward motion is the
g4mXGwuH0lo,358560,363919,antidote  to all of that  and so forward
g4mXGwuH0lo,363919,369440,you must go  the beginning is always the hardest
g4mXGwuH0lo,369440,374720,because our thoughts are a mightier foe  than life's obstacles
g4mXGwuH0lo,374720,380400,thoughts take on lives of their own they  become monsters demons dead ends  obstacles
g4mXGwuH0lo,380400,387190,on the other hand just ask that we  adjust there is no obstacle that can't  be addressed by stepping into it
g4mXGwuH0lo,387190,393440,[Music]  and so while the temptation is to sit  thinking speculating about how
g4mXGwuH0lo,393440,400800,challenging the road ahead  this is where you think less and move  more harness the world as it comes
g4mXGwuH0lo,400800,405840,because the truth is nothing is as big  as it appears to be life is incredibly
g4mXGwuH0lo,405840,412639,solvable every problem has a solution  every bad chapter ends every setback is  a chance to be more than you've ever
g4mXGwuH0lo,412639,420400,been but how would you know that  if you bowed down to the mountains in  your head how would you know that
g4mXGwuH0lo,420400,428000,if you never began  [Music]  so let today be the dotted line you sign
g4mXGwuH0lo,428000,435759,with your future self  a promise to be aware that the  mountaintop peers over you but to not be
g4mXGwuH0lo,435759,441360,distracted by its shadow  to take the climb one rock one step one
g4mXGwuH0lo,441360,449039,second at a time  let it be an acknowledgement that  nothing light throws at you can't be
g4mXGwuH0lo,449039,455039,broken down and conquered so long as you  don't get in your own way
g4mXGwuH0lo,455039,460880,gone are the days of being held captive  behind steel bars of self-doubt and fear
g4mXGwuH0lo,460880,466000,that road ahead is not the problem it  never was
g4mXGwuH0lo,466000,471280,refusing to give yourself permission to  travel down it was the problem so
g4mXGwuH0lo,471280,477440,without constraints  meet  life head on
g4mXGwuH0lo,477440,485039,let the trials and tribulations emerge  because they will  but know that you will rise to meet them
g4mXGwuH0lo,485039,490879,let the unknown highlight all that you  don't know you can't see fine the one
g4mXGwuH0lo,490879,497919,thing you are sure of is that you will  one by one transform the unseen into
g4mXGwuH0lo,497919,503280,strength  and when those thoughts emerge  telling you that you've gone too far
g4mXGwuH0lo,503280,510319,that you're in over your head that this  isn't meant for you  know them not as truth but as the only
g4mXGwuH0lo,510319,516000,obstacle that can derail and distract  you don't have time for make-believe
g4mXGwuH0lo,516000,524080,monsters no not today so onward you go  to map the unknown to tame the untamed
g4mXGwuH0lo,524080,529519,to live your life  the way it was meant
g4mXGwuH0lo,529519,534820,to be left  [Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,537830,551059,[Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,560800,565920,every step you take  is an investment  [Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,565920,572260,every decision to do the difficult thing  is a gift to your future self
g4mXGwuH0lo,572260,579920,[Music]  think about this for a second  one of the many things that makes being
g4mXGwuH0lo,579920,585600,human so incredible  is our ability to engage in delayed  gratification
g4mXGwuH0lo,585600,591040,to do things now that will elevate us at  a future time
g4mXGwuH0lo,591040,597360,and at a fundamental level we understand  that we've heard the famous marshmallow  study where kids were left alone in a
g4mXGwuH0lo,597360,602640,room with the marshmallow placed in  front of them and  the ones who showed restraint and could
g4mXGwuH0lo,602640,608720,resist eating it ended up  in many regards being more successful as
g4mXGwuH0lo,608720,615200,adults we've all heard the mantras  working hard pays off
g4mXGwuH0lo,615200,621519,that's valuable  i'd like to take it a step further  [Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,621519,627680,because when you say yes in the face of  adversity when you move forward when  tired
g4mXGwuH0lo,627680,632800,seek out a way amidst the chaos of life  you are contributing
g4mXGwuH0lo,632800,638240,to a foundation so powerful that it will  elevate you in ways outside your current
g4mXGwuH0lo,638240,645839,level of awareness  by simply saying yes  when i was unsure and often fearful by
g4mXGwuH0lo,645839,652880,continuing to write and speak i was  unknowingly building these opportunities  that would manifest years later right
g4mXGwuH0lo,652880,660240,many of which were not planned they were  not methodical  [Music]  my dedication and my north star never
g4mXGwuH0lo,660240,665519,changed i held on tightly to those but  uh the surrounding components were
g4mXGwuH0lo,665519,671920,always moving and transforming people  are in my life today because of steps i  took five years ago
g4mXGwuH0lo,671920,677040,i know things about myself and my hopes  and my dreams because of risks i took
g4mXGwuH0lo,677040,683600,when i was let's face it too ignorant to  understand their repercussions  but i knew it felt right see here's what
g4mXGwuH0lo,683600,690560,i did understand  if i as emerson put it hitched my wagon  to a star and moved towards it
g4mXGwuH0lo,690560,696640,when i felt great and when i didn't  when i was confident and when i wasn't  when i was winning and when i was not i
g4mXGwuH0lo,696640,702880,knew the other stuff would take care of  itself i trusted the process
g4mXGwuH0lo,702880,710480,and here's why that matters  here's why i'm taking you all on a  little trip down memory lane
g4mXGwuH0lo,710480,719600,because  writing speaking inspiring storytelling  they are my world within what is yours
g4mXGwuH0lo,719600,725680,what is it that moves you that lights up  your soul i want you to know that
g4mXGwuH0lo,725680,733120,i want you to know that because its  pursuit requires not only a delayed  gratification but an acceptance that
g4mXGwuH0lo,733120,739839,your dedication will evolve in ways so  incredible that you can't even imagine
g4mXGwuH0lo,739839,745040,that all those little decisions become  emergent and together represent
g4mXGwuH0lo,745040,750639,something more powerful than the sum of  its parts
g4mXGwuH0lo,750639,756320,i love the example or idea of the human  brain right so complex and powerful that
g4mXGwuH0lo,756320,762480,it appears almost divine  it's essentially a universe behind our  eyes
g4mXGwuH0lo,762480,768560,even our understanding our comprehension  is minimal we are awed by its capability
g4mXGwuH0lo,768560,775920,yet it's not about one single piece of  the brain  the tissues or the neurons individually
g4mXGwuH0lo,775920,781760,it's the network all these microscopic  occurrences create together
g4mXGwuH0lo,781760,787519,something  bigger than everything combined creating  a consciousness we can't even find or
g4mXGwuH0lo,787519,793040,point to when looking at the evidence  but we know it exists and we know it's
g4mXGwuH0lo,793040,798079,somehow derived from this ball of  nervous tissue this is not unlike one's
g4mXGwuH0lo,798079,805920,pursuit of excellence the level of  achievement or consciousness we are  searching for it can't be singularly
g4mXGwuH0lo,805920,812320,identified it's emergent  it  materializes after the discipline after
g4mXGwuH0lo,812320,818320,the consistent work after the  self-belief after the will to do what is
g4mXGwuH0lo,818320,824160,required whether we wanted to in the  moment or we didn't
g4mXGwuH0lo,824160,830720,then we get our quote unquote  consciousness you can't and won't always
g4mXGwuH0lo,830720,836399,see the value in your dedication in your  sacrifice  and let me level with you i get how
g4mXGwuH0lo,836399,841839,crazy it feels to think yeah but someday  it will mean something someday that work
g4mXGwuH0lo,841839,849040,will put people in my life that will  change my world elevate my existence it  will create opportunities that expedite
g4mXGwuH0lo,849040,857120,my evolution lessons and occurrences  that will amplify  my wisdom and world view but that's the
g4mXGwuH0lo,857120,862480,name of the game if you know in your  heart you are pointing to the right star
g4mXGwuH0lo,862480,870000,then it's just about stepping adjusting  and repeating move adjust move adjust
g4mXGwuH0lo,870000,876720,move adjust  there will be a time  when you look over your shoulder and are
g4mXGwuH0lo,876720,881760,stunned by what you've created by the  distance you traveled
g4mXGwuH0lo,881760,886880,look you can't see the future you can't  know what everything will mean and what
g4mXGwuH0lo,886880,892560,will occur  but you can continue forward into the
g4mXGwuH0lo,892560,900320,darkness  so that when the long awaited light  inevitably presents itself you are in
g4mXGwuH0lo,900320,906560,position to receive it  to stand on the foundation you have been
g4mXGwuH0lo,906560,912839,building  all  along
g4mXGwuH0lo,930560,936560,when the water rises  it sink or swim
g4mXGwuH0lo,938160,945040,we pick up certain truths as we make our  way through life  realizations little awakenings
g4mXGwuH0lo,945040,950720,patterns  that allow us to map the things around  us so that we can navigate
g4mXGwuH0lo,950720,956880,this crazy place  and here's one such realization for my
g4mXGwuH0lo,956880,961920,own journey  when you pursue your best
g4mXGwuH0lo,961920,967839,you live your best life  your best is the north star to guide you
g4mXGwuH0lo,967839,972959,a bar line or benchmark that's always  moving a reminder that you can always do
g4mXGwuH0lo,972959,978160,more and be more  a reminder that life tomorrow
g4mXGwuH0lo,978160,983079,can always be different than life today
g4mXGwuH0lo,984240,989600,to pursue your best in my opinion is  synonymous with capturing all that is
g4mXGwuH0lo,989600,995680,good in this world  capitalizing on potential
g4mXGwuH0lo,995680,1000720,is to utilize those resources in need of  an architect
g4mXGwuH0lo,1000720,1006160,that pen in need of a poet brush in need  of a painter story in need of a writer
g4mXGwuH0lo,1006160,1013040,or populace in need of a leader  it's a pursuit that not only supplements
g4mXGwuH0lo,1013040,1019759,our existence here on earth  now i believe it is in and of itself why
g4mXGwuH0lo,1019759,1026240,we are here on earth  but like every ideal pragmatism seems to
g4mXGwuH0lo,1026240,1032558,get in the way  meaning  well life is more difficult in execution
g4mXGwuH0lo,1032558,1037918,than it looks on paper  we can't be our quote unquote best every
g4mXGwuH0lo,1037918,1045199,day we sometimes fall short of that mark  our outcomes don't always align with our  expectations
g4mXGwuH0lo,1045438,1051360,the perpetual journey to one's best is  neither straight nor without discomfort
g4mXGwuH0lo,1051360,1057919,it's more like the navigating of a new  world without a map or compass a world  that we're by default ill-equipped to
g4mXGwuH0lo,1057919,1063679,take on when we begin  and i believe that 99 of success
g4mXGwuH0lo,1063679,1068720,is reliant upon the willingness to move  into that great unknown
g4mXGwuH0lo,1068720,1075280,and allowing adversity to shape us  but that remaining one percent is a
g4mXGwuH0lo,1075280,1081280,little bit different  that one percent
g4mXGwuH0lo,1081280,1086880,is when we see what we've never seen  do what we've never done
g4mXGwuH0lo,1086880,1092080,it's uncovering our best  in those moments we feel our worst
g4mXGwuH0lo,1092080,1099679,climbing the highest when we're at our  lowest when the water rises it's finding  a way to swim
g4mXGwuH0lo,1099679,1105360,see the majority of life calls for tiny  adjustments  it's observing and learning and moving
g4mXGwuH0lo,1105360,1110480,on  but rarely do we talk about the darkest
g4mXGwuH0lo,1110480,1117200,moments when we feel as though we are up  to our neck in the trials and  tribulations of life
g4mXGwuH0lo,1117200,1122320,when the world doesn't relay messages of  hope or prosperity no the only incoming
g4mXGwuH0lo,1122320,1128960,message  is despair  you're essentially david looking up at
g4mXGwuH0lo,1128960,1134880,goliath  perhaps a goliath of your making
g4mXGwuH0lo,1134880,1140799,perhaps not but a goliath nonetheless  so why here
g4mXGwuH0lo,1140799,1146320,why are these dark moments different  than the 99 percent
g4mXGwuH0lo,1146320,1151360,why is a stage provided  at the very time when the limelight
g4mXGwuH0lo,1151360,1156080,feels further out of reach than it ever  has
g4mXGwuH0lo,1156799,1163840,because this this moment is when you  prove to yourself who you are
g4mXGwuH0lo,1163840,1170400,think you've dug deep in the past  you think you've given your all back
g4mXGwuH0lo,1170400,1175919,then  no you have no idea what you're capable  of
g4mXGwuH0lo,1175919,1182400,the world provides a stage in our  darkest moments  so that you can pull back the curtains
g4mXGwuH0lo,1182400,1188720,and illuminate your strength  it floods your world with adversity so
g4mXGwuH0lo,1188720,1196160,that you can trust yourself to navigate  the waters  and if you can find a way here
g4mXGwuH0lo,1196160,1201600,when the walls are closing clock is  ticking and water is rising what can't
g4mXGwuH0lo,1201600,1209760,you do  you ever asked yourself that question
g4mXGwuH0lo,1210400,1216240,those moments show us what we can be and  that is why the one percent is
g4mXGwuH0lo,1216240,1222799,everything  why is it that rock bottom becomes a
g4mXGwuH0lo,1222799,1228960,bridge to so many new tomorrows  or the losses we dread most become the
g4mXGwuH0lo,1228960,1235600,change we need most  the answer is simple
g4mXGwuH0lo,1235600,1243990,because in those moments we find within  ourselves the keys to transformation  [Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,1244320,1250480,so you didn't know  that you can leap that far
g4mXGwuH0lo,1252080,1257120,and you didn't know  because you've never been pushed
g4mXGwuH0lo,1257120,1264480,so close to the edge  running it so fast a speed
g4mXGwuH0lo,1264480,1272159,but in those moments you learn that you  can take flight  you learn you have the power
g4mXGwuH0lo,1272159,1278720,to stand again  so while the vast majority of life is
g4mXGwuH0lo,1278720,1285919,saying yes when most would say no  it's how we choose to act while immersed
g4mXGwuH0lo,1285919,1291039,in our lowest lows  that provides the framework and the
g4mXGwuH0lo,1291039,1298400,opportunity  i believe that the tears indicative of  despair streaming down your face look a
g4mXGwuH0lo,1298400,1304320,lot like the tears that emerge during  our happiest moments they are the same
g4mXGwuH0lo,1304320,1309600,one just precedes the other see despair  gives you a chance to look at life
g4mXGwuH0lo,1309600,1316240,differently look at yourself differently  to look in the mirror  and understand that the reflection
g4mXGwuH0lo,1316240,1322080,looking back is capable of leading a  revolution in your soul
g4mXGwuH0lo,1322080,1327840,and i get how hard that is  how detached from reality it might seem
g4mXGwuH0lo,1327840,1333919,but isn't that what tomorrow is  a detachment from the reality the
g4mXGwuH0lo,1333919,1340640,parameters and the rules of today  it's not until that seed is buried
g4mXGwuH0lo,1340640,1349360,beneath the earth that it plants roots  that it takes aim at the sky and when  you are stuck beneath the chaos of life
g4mXGwuH0lo,1349360,1354480,you have to know that this is where you  too transform
g4mXGwuH0lo,1354480,1360640,so forget yesterday shoreline this is  where you build tomorrow's destination
g4mXGwuH0lo,1360640,1366080,don't fixate on what is gone when you  can dream of all that is to come and
g4mXGwuH0lo,1366080,1372240,don't dwell on who you were when you can  celebrate  all you will be
g4mXGwuH0lo,1372240,1376400,when the water rises
g4mXGwuH0lo,1377600,1380600,swim
g4mXGwuH0lo,1383440,1405149,[Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,1414320,1421360,i woke up  put my coffee on the desk  opened my laptop stared at a blank
g4mXGwuH0lo,1421360,1428159,screen  and a little button popped up in the top  right corner
g4mXGwuH0lo,1428159,1433520,check for updates  nope
g4mXGwuH0lo,1433520,1439919,ask me again later  [Music]  why why not now
g4mXGwuH0lo,1439919,1445440,i don't know i don't necessarily care  about the improvements i guess is just  inconvenient
g4mXGwuH0lo,1445440,1450670,it can wait  and that's kind of it
g4mXGwuH0lo,1450670,1455760,[Music]  let's face it the laptop doesn't matter  the update
g4mXGwuH0lo,1455760,1461600,in this scenario is not important  but bear with me because i think what it
g4mXGwuH0lo,1461600,1468000,stands for  when you apply it to the big picture  does matter
g4mXGwuH0lo,1468000,1475120,our proclivity to take less because less  is  convenient
g4mXGwuH0lo,1475120,1480559,our predisposition to sell ourselves  short because it's safer to leave so
g4mXGwuH0lo,1480559,1487039,much of ourselves on the shelf  because well things don't break when
g4mXGwuH0lo,1487039,1494720,they're on the shelf  but you can't be both flawless and live
g4mXGwuH0lo,1494720,1502960,your life  because life comes with wear and tear  the value is the experience
g4mXGwuH0lo,1503440,1509039,and a flawless existence is void of  experience of stories of
g4mXGwuH0lo,1509039,1512039,adventure
g4mXGwuH0lo,1514240,1521840,there's a little parable  about two seeds being planted  [Music]  and one of them just wants to grow
g4mXGwuH0lo,1521840,1528320,wants to feel what the sun is like  wants to see how high she can get
g4mXGwuH0lo,1528320,1534300,experience the breeze the cool air  [Music]  and so she grew
g4mXGwuH0lo,1534300,1542960,[Music]  and sure she dealt with hard days she  had her difficult times but ultimately
g4mXGwuH0lo,1542960,1549760,grew to live her best life  the other seed
g4mXGwuH0lo,1549760,1556240,worried  worried about leaving her home
g4mXGwuH0lo,1556240,1562480,the world that was the ground around her  worried about damaging her roots worried  about what could be waiting for her in
g4mXGwuH0lo,1562480,1569440,the dark  about the sun being too hot and the  breeze too strong  [Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,1569440,1575760,and ultimately stayed right where she  was  playing it safe until one morning
g4mXGwuH0lo,1575760,1581760,a chicken came wandering by and ate the  seed off the ground and see this spells
g4mXGwuH0lo,1581760,1589120,out a few things  one  we can at any moment
g4mXGwuH0lo,1589120,1595200,decide to step into that next level  evolve into that next chapter
g4mXGwuH0lo,1595919,1601440,but  also not  doing so
g4mXGwuH0lo,1601440,1608640,comes with a cost  sometimes a hidden cost  [Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,1608640,1614799,there's a tendency to think that  preserving the status quo  because it's safe
g4mXGwuH0lo,1614799,1620640,is valuable  but understand something you are not a
g4mXGwuH0lo,1620640,1626240,collector's item  [Music]  you weren't made for preservation you
g4mXGwuH0lo,1626240,1631919,were made for growth  [Music]  to expand
g4mXGwuH0lo,1631919,1639159,to reach out towards the heavens and  feel that sun that breeze
g4mXGwuH0lo,1640159,1645760,ensure upgrading means vulnerability it  means accepting that the unknown is
g4mXGwuH0lo,1645760,1652399,bigger than you  but also contains within it everything
g4mXGwuH0lo,1652399,1655799,you need
g4mXGwuH0lo,1658000,1663039,whether it was people  things money resources
g4mXGwuH0lo,1663039,1668799,i used to think like that seed  right how can i hold on to what i have
g4mXGwuH0lo,1668799,1674559,contain play small i can't lose this  i've come too far i've worked too hard
g4mXGwuH0lo,1674559,1680840,what if everything goes wrong i can't  upgrade now  maybe
g4mXGwuH0lo,1680840,1686720,later maybe someday when the time is  right  when it won't hurt or require that i
g4mXGwuH0lo,1686720,1692398,step outside of this little world i've  created but guess what
g4mXGwuH0lo,1693279,1699039,growth  always asks of us  that we leave the comfort of now it
g4mXGwuH0lo,1699039,1704880,always offers us the world  in exchange for the courage to see the
g4mXGwuH0lo,1704880,1710720,unseen and trust ourselves to bring it  to life
g4mXGwuH0lo,1710720,1717760,and when i realized this  i saw how the act of trying to  perpetually maintain the status quo is
g4mXGwuH0lo,1717760,1723120,debilitating  it's looking at life through a lens of  scarcity it's only when you start to
g4mXGwuH0lo,1723120,1729039,grasp how abundant life is  that you realize
g4mXGwuH0lo,1729039,1735440,by simply stepping into that person you  are destined to be you'll attract what  matters
g4mXGwuH0lo,1735440,1741120,some things will go  you'll leave them behind
g4mXGwuH0lo,1741279,1746799,but those things no longer serve you  they played their part they added their
g4mXGwuH0lo,1746799,1754240,value  and are now merely stepping  stones as you move to something greater
g4mXGwuH0lo,1754240,1761120,and that's just it  sometimes living  means wishing you did things differently
g4mXGwuH0lo,1761120,1767840,looking back and acknowledging that you  need to be better  sometimes living means losing the wrong
g4mXGwuH0lo,1767840,1775360,people in your life to make space for  the right ones  sometimes it means spending days
g4mXGwuH0lo,1775360,1780799,months even years wandering down the  wrong path  so that you can get a glimpse so that
g4mXGwuH0lo,1780799,1788000,you can realize what the right path  looks like  sometimes it means no reward no
g4mXGwuH0lo,1788000,1793760,validation until that compounding  finally takes place finally you see just
g4mXGwuH0lo,1793760,1799279,how powerful those small steps were and  will always be
g4mXGwuH0lo,1799279,1805360,it means seeing yourself as the person  you know you can be  maybe not necessarily the one you are
g4mXGwuH0lo,1805360,1812559,today  but betting on yourself when no one else
g4mXGwuH0lo,1812559,1819360,would  there's an idea that people are neither  good nor evil
g4mXGwuH0lo,1819360,1824720,but they have both within them  they choose through their day-to-day
g4mXGwuH0lo,1824720,1832080,action how they'll live who they'll be  and sure this is a tad oversimplified  but i think the duality is useful right
g4mXGwuH0lo,1832080,1839039,because in a different context for  everything that occurs in your life you  can find a reason to celebrate
g4mXGwuH0lo,1839039,1844640,or a reason to grieve  a reason to grow or a reason to hide it
g4mXGwuH0lo,1844640,1851600,all comes down to what one chooses to  see how they choose to look at the world
g4mXGwuH0lo,1851600,1859279,i'll never forget when peterson talked  about curtains right with tears or holes  in them same world on the other side
g4mXGwuH0lo,1859279,1865039,but the opening that you choose to look  through  paints an entirely different picture
g4mXGwuH0lo,1865039,1870158,right contributes to an entirely  different understanding
g4mXGwuH0lo,1870240,1876799,and look i'm a pragmatist i just am i'd  never ask people to close their eyes and  pretend everything's perfect
g4mXGwuH0lo,1876799,1883519,to wander down the path before you  expecting everything to be easy no but  what i am saying
g4mXGwuH0lo,1883519,1888559,is that the path before you is where  you'll uncover the meaning in life and
g4mXGwuH0lo,1888559,1896559,meaning requires that we are from time  to time uncomfortable  to go where we most want to go we must
g4mXGwuH0lo,1896559,1902000,leave something behind in the reality is  that while it's scary
g4mXGwuH0lo,1902000,1908000,while it can be alarming and even  painful it is always worth it
g4mXGwuH0lo,1908000,1913919,that what's on the other side is what  makes life worth living i want you to  know
g4mXGwuH0lo,1913919,1920080,that you don't need to be walking into  the same rooms talking to the same  people doing the same things no not if
g4mXGwuH0lo,1920080,1927200,you've outgrown that reality  not if you're ready for the next chapter
g4mXGwuH0lo,1927200,1932840,so let's make a pact to view life not as  an obligation but as an
g4mXGwuH0lo,1932840,1938640,opportunity something challenging but  beautiful mysterious but plentiful let's
g4mXGwuH0lo,1938640,1945760,view the challenges along the way  not as something going wrong or some  kind of alarm
g4mXGwuH0lo,1945760,1952880,but rather an indication that you are  doing something right  that you're stepping into the controlled
g4mXGwuH0lo,1952880,1962159,chaos of your day-to-day  finding the courage to meet new people  try new things take risks evolve
g4mXGwuH0lo,1962159,1967440,this is what life is about  and if you can find it within yourself
g4mXGwuH0lo,1967440,1972480,to see it that way to be grateful for  the discomfort that makes its way in and
g4mXGwuH0lo,1972480,1981518,out of our lives  you'll know that you are evolving  reaching towards that sky
g4mXGwuH0lo,1982240,1988799,because the danger as far as i'm  concerned is never what happens along  the way
g4mXGwuH0lo,1988799,1994320,it's what doesn't happen  because we never let ourselves accept
g4mXGwuH0lo,1994320,2001200,what the world had to offer  and so on that note i think today is the
g4mXGwuH0lo,2001200,2007880,perfect  day  to upgrade
g4mXGwuH0lo,2010000,2030789,[Music]
g4mXGwuH0lo,2035279,2037360,you
