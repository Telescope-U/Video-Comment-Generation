avb5kGhOBbI,150,3278,- Do you really think this place has asbestos in it?
avb5kGhOBbI,3278,4900,- [Maeve] I don't know.
avb5kGhOBbI,4900,6150,"There's worse ways to go, I suppose."
avb5kGhOBbI,6150,7290,"- God, yeah."
avb5kGhOBbI,7290,9712,My auntie got eaten by wasps.
avb5kGhOBbI,9712,10750,- What?
avb5kGhOBbI,10750,12620,Was she stung to death? (chuckles)
avb5kGhOBbI,12620,13670,- No.
avb5kGhOBbI,13670,14930,She was eaten.
avb5kGhOBbI,14930,16853,"Oh, he's cute."
avb5kGhOBbI,18380,19849,- [Maeve] What is it with you and stoners?
avb5kGhOBbI,19850,21600,- Doesn't he remind you of someone?
avb5kGhOBbI,22770,23770,- Adam?
avb5kGhOBbI,23770,26690,"- No, I was thinking more like a boiled Ryan Gosling."
avb5kGhOBbI,26690,27911,"- [Maeve] No, Adam."
avb5kGhOBbI,27911,29399,- I deserve closure!
avb5kGhOBbI,29399,31690,"- Everyone inside, now!"
avb5kGhOBbI,31690,33770,Ruby thinks Kyle should change the way he dresses.
avb5kGhOBbI,33770,35480,But I think he looks nice.
avb5kGhOBbI,35480,36313,"I mean, he has been wearing"
avb5kGhOBbI,36313,37390,"a lot of trackie bottoms recently,"
avb5kGhOBbI,37390,40140,but that's only 'cause he set his jeans on fire.
avb5kGhOBbI,40140,41230,- What?
avb5kGhOBbI,41230,43000,"- He's got second-degree burns on his thighs,"
avb5kGhOBbI,43000,45442,"but he was blazed when it happened, so it only hurt a bit."
avb5kGhOBbI,45442,46685,(whistles)
avb5kGhOBbI,46685,49583,"I think he's peacocking, but with words."
avb5kGhOBbI,51800,53630,Let's do a mind map.
avb5kGhOBbI,53630,54463,- What's that?
avb5kGhOBbI,54463,55640,"- Oh, it's just writing stuff down."
avb5kGhOBbI,55640,57010,It's really good for hard decisions
avb5kGhOBbI,57010,59460,"like, should I get a fringe, even though Mum says"
avb5kGhOBbI,59460,60860,it'll make my face look chubby?
avb5kGhOBbI,60860,63893,Or should I tell Mum I hate her and run away from home?
avb5kGhOBbI,65013,66360,- I don't want a boyfriend.
avb5kGhOBbI,66360,67860,- [Aimee] I don't get it.
avb5kGhOBbI,67860,69910,Having a boyfriend is the best thing.
avb5kGhOBbI,69910,71120,- What's so good about it?
avb5kGhOBbI,71120,72820,"- Last week, I got chased by a fox,"
avb5kGhOBbI,72820,75500,and Kyle threw a shoe at it.
avb5kGhOBbI,75500,76993,It was so romantic.
avb5kGhOBbI,78290,79759,- What would you wear to meet your boyfriend's parents
avb5kGhOBbI,79759,81600,for the first time?
avb5kGhOBbI,81600,84439,"- Okay, right, whatever you do, do not dress like you."
avb5kGhOBbI,84440,85830,"My brother brought a girl home once,"
avb5kGhOBbI,85830,87240,"and she wore a Nine Inch Nails T-shirt,"
avb5kGhOBbI,87240,89350,and my mom thought she worshiped Satan.
avb5kGhOBbI,89350,91130,"Also, she did a massive shit in the toilet."
avb5kGhOBbI,91130,92840,My dad had to break it up with a stick.
avb5kGhOBbI,92840,96071,"So don't do that, either, 'cause first impressions count."
avb5kGhOBbI,96071,97250,Good luck!
avb5kGhOBbI,97250,99140,So I think I need to talk to Otis.
avb5kGhOBbI,99140,100110,- Problems with Kyle?
avb5kGhOBbI,100110,101777,"- Oh, no, I'm with Steve now."
avb5kGhOBbI,102670,103780,- Who's Steve?
avb5kGhOBbI,103780,105570,"- You know, Top-Heavy Steve?"
avb5kGhOBbI,105570,106733,Built like a Chupa Chup.
avb5kGhOBbI,109580,110890,- [Maeve] Cool.
avb5kGhOBbI,110890,112920,- What the hell are you doing?
avb5kGhOBbI,112920,114540,- I'm dumping you.
avb5kGhOBbI,114540,115541,For her.
avb5kGhOBbI,115541,116990,(chuckles)
avb5kGhOBbI,116990,117840,- Are you mental?
avb5kGhOBbI,118930,120400,She's a slag.
avb5kGhOBbI,120400,122083,"- Yeah, you're right."
avb5kGhOBbI,122960,123943,But so am I.
avb5kGhOBbI,125896,127932,(gasps)
avb5kGhOBbI,127932,128990,- I'm not a slag.
avb5kGhOBbI,128990,130823,"- Me either, it sounded good."
avb5kGhOBbI,130823,131655,Just keep walking.
avb5kGhOBbI,135130,136410,- Why am I here?
avb5kGhOBbI,136410,137480,I hate fairs.
avb5kGhOBbI,137480,139440,- You're here because Steve is doing extra study
avb5kGhOBbI,139440,141720,for your stupid altitude scheme.
avb5kGhOBbI,141720,142553,You're my date.
avb5kGhOBbI,142553,144659,"- Aptitude scheme, Aimee. - Yeah, that's what I said."
avb5kGhOBbI,144660,146180,Can you win me a giant pig?
avb5kGhOBbI,146180,147019,- How you getting on with your form?
avb5kGhOBbI,147020,149250,- Everyone has a thing except me.
avb5kGhOBbI,149250,152250,I'm hoping this form is gonna tell me what my thing is.
avb5kGhOBbI,152250,153150,- Your thing?
avb5kGhOBbI,153150,154243,"- Yes, my thing."
avb5kGhOBbI,155100,156810,You have your feminine books.
avb5kGhOBbI,156810,157989,- Feminist.
avb5kGhOBbI,157990,159040,What's your form say?
avb5kGhOBbI,160257,161703,It says I should be a baker.
avb5kGhOBbI,163240,164880,"- Aims, I think it might be banker."
avb5kGhOBbI,164880,165930,Baker's not on there.
avb5kGhOBbI,170120,172023,- I think I'm gonna stick with baker.
avb5kGhOBbI,173550,175413,I do really like toast.
avb5kGhOBbI,179590,180840,What you doing?
avb5kGhOBbI,181731,183314,He's wanking on me!
avb5kGhOBbI,187211,188711,"Can I get off the bus, please?"
avb5kGhOBbI,189710,191140,"- What happened to this cake, exactly?"
avb5kGhOBbI,191140,193120,"- Oh, it didn't look so bad before,"
avb5kGhOBbI,193120,196470,"but then I was on the bus, and a guy wanked on my leg,"
avb5kGhOBbI,196470,199970,"and I got a bit of a shock, and I smushed the cake."
avb5kGhOBbI,199970,200803,- What?
avb5kGhOBbI,201758,203263,- Do you think it'll stain?
avb5kGhOBbI,203263,204463,I love these jeans.
avb5kGhOBbI,205378,207230,- You you have to report it.
avb5kGhOBbI,207230,208690,"- It's fine, they were only cheap."
avb5kGhOBbI,208690,210423,"- No, you've been assaulted."
avb5kGhOBbI,211560,213099,"- I think he was just lonely,"
avb5kGhOBbI,213100,214440,"or not right in the head or something,"
avb5kGhOBbI,214440,216560,which is weird 'cause he was quite handsome.
avb5kGhOBbI,216560,218300,"- Aimes, this is serious."
avb5kGhOBbI,218300,219790,- It's silly.
avb5kGhOBbI,219790,221263,"I'm fine, honestly."
avb5kGhOBbI,222660,226953,"- Okay, I know what I want to do for my birthday."
avb5kGhOBbI,226953,228473,I want us to go to the police.
avb5kGhOBbI,235170,236002,- Ooh.
avb5kGhOBbI,236930,238510,Hope I get my jeans back.
avb5kGhOBbI,238510,240920,"- Do you really want them back, though?"
avb5kGhOBbI,240920,242940,"- Yeah, they're the perfect bootleg, Maeve."
avb5kGhOBbI,242940,244490,You don't find that very often.
avb5kGhOBbI,245660,246840,- It's true.
avb5kGhOBbI,246840,248700,- Do you think they're watching us?
avb5kGhOBbI,248700,249550,"- Yeah, probably."
avb5kGhOBbI,252020,253260,- (farts) Oh!
avb5kGhOBbI,253260,254900,- No.
avb5kGhOBbI,254900,256799,"- Can I have my jeans back, please?"
avb5kGhOBbI,256799,259088,"I'm gonna go, I'm sorry to make a fuss."
avb5kGhOBbI,259088,264089,"- Aimes, what if he does this to someone else?"
avb5kGhOBbI,264810,265960,I know you can do this.
avb5kGhOBbI,267060,267893,Please?
avb5kGhOBbI,269530,271116,"- You're doing brilliantly, Aimee."
avb5kGhOBbI,271116,272366,- [Maeve] Yeah.
avb5kGhOBbI,274790,276867,- Just take your time.
avb5kGhOBbI,277803,279136,Try to remember.
avb5kGhOBbI,282590,284310,- He was already on the bus.
avb5kGhOBbI,284310,286260,Sorry for ruining your birthday.
avb5kGhOBbI,286260,287360,"- Weirdly, one of the best birthdays"
avb5kGhOBbI,287360,288560,I've had in a long time.
avb5kGhOBbI,289704,292787,(slow pensive music)

avb5kGhOBbI,307210,310293,(slow pensive music)
avb5kGhOBbI,319733,321816,(coughs)
avb5kGhOBbI,323090,325320,- [Bus Driver] Everything all right?
avb5kGhOBbI,325320,326563,"- Sorry, wrong bus."
avb5kGhOBbI,327418,328780,(bus doors puff)
avb5kGhOBbI,328780,331010,"- I didn't try and steal your boyfriend, Ola."
avb5kGhOBbI,331010,332600,I had to tell him how I felt.
avb5kGhOBbI,332600,335310,"- You didn't have to, Maeve."
avb5kGhOBbI,335310,336597,You chose to.
avb5kGhOBbI,336597,338460,Did you even like Otis?
avb5kGhOBbI,338460,339530,Or did you just want to win?
avb5kGhOBbI,339530,340510,You're a snake.
avb5kGhOBbI,340510,341343,- [Maeve] Yeah?
avb5kGhOBbI,341343,342490,At least I don't pretend to be so sweet
avb5kGhOBbI,342490,343580,and nice all the time.
avb5kGhOBbI,343580,345710,- [Maeve And Ola] You don't know anything about me!
avb5kGhOBbI,345710,348293,- Stop fighting over a stupid boy!
avb5kGhOBbI,349771,351171,"- Aimes, why are you crying?"
avb5kGhOBbI,353150,355996,- Because I can't get on the bus.
avb5kGhOBbI,355996,357603,"- Oh, Aimes, it's okay."
avb5kGhOBbI,358610,359443,It's okay.
avb5kGhOBbI,362070,363370,- What are you doing here?
avb5kGhOBbI,366490,367373,- Getting a bus.
avb5kGhOBbI,370030,371932,We're all getting a bus.

avb5kGhOBbI,390362,391800,- [Bus Driver] Getting on or what?
avb5kGhOBbI,391800,392800,- Give her a minute.
avb5kGhOBbI,394830,395979,It's just a stupid bus.
avb5kGhOBbI,398291,400081,- It's just a stupid bus.
