eDIHLlIIYFQ,80,1360,all right so in this video we're gonna
eDIHLlIIYFQ,1360,5120,talk about anatomy art cheats i promise
eDIHLlIIYFQ,5120,7520,you that this is gonna blow your mind
eDIHLlIIYFQ,7520,10240,okay so our first tip okay so if you're
eDIHLlIIYFQ,10240,11920,having trouble with the throwing arms
eDIHLlIIYFQ,11920,14240,here is an easier way so the first thing
eDIHLlIIYFQ,14240,16480,you're gonna do is to draw hands just
eDIHLlIIYFQ,16480,19680,straight up hands no arms just vibes
eDIHLlIIYFQ,19680,21520,this is gonna allow you to make arm
eDIHLlIIYFQ,21520,24800,poses that don't look stiff also this is
eDIHLlIIYFQ,24800,26480,gonna give you more freedom to
eDIHLlIIYFQ,26480,29199,experiment with the posing once you've
eDIHLlIIYFQ,29199,31039,drawn the hands it's gonna be easier for
eDIHLlIIYFQ,31039,33840,you to visualize how the arms are gonna
eDIHLlIIYFQ,33840,36000,look simply draw a circle for the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,36000,38320,shoulder and another circle for the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,38320,40640,elbow the next tip if you're having
eDIHLlIIYFQ,40640,42640,trouble drawing faces in different
eDIHLlIIYFQ,42640,44719,angles and you just can't find the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,44719,47200,perfect reference on pinterest then
eDIHLlIIYFQ,47200,49600,allow me to introduce to you this
eDIHLlIIYFQ,49600,52239,website so basically what we have here
eDIHLlIIYFQ,52239,55280,is a 3d face you can rotate the head
eDIHLlIIYFQ,55280,58320,however you want and then once you've
eDIHLlIIYFQ,58320,60000,chosen your head it's going to show you
eDIHLlIIYFQ,60000,63039,real life pictures of that same angle
eDIHLlIIYFQ,63039,65518,what's more is that you can choose the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,65518,67840,emotions for example if you want this
eDIHLlIIYFQ,67840,70000,guy to be happy there are a bunch of
eDIHLlIIYFQ,70000,72400,references for that you can also choose
eDIHLlIIYFQ,72400,74960,how old your reference looks and there's
eDIHLlIIYFQ,74960,77600,more including the gender age range and
eDIHLlIIYFQ,77600,80159,a bunch of other accessories it's sad
eDIHLlIIYFQ,80159,82320,that there isn't an option for bald
eDIHLlIIYFQ,82320,85520,people though but also it gets better
eDIHLlIIYFQ,85520,87759,because there's this other site that
eDIHLlIIYFQ,87759,91280,does exactly that except that it's for
eDIHLlIIYFQ,91280,93759,animals this is for all my furry
eDIHLlIIYFQ,93759,95920,homeboys out there so you have this
eDIHLlIIYFQ,95920,98079,weird animal bone structure right here
eDIHLlIIYFQ,98079,100320,and it basically works like the other
eDIHLlIIYFQ,100320,104079,site except you can choose among so many
eDIHLlIIYFQ,104079,107600,of these species it even has a frog look
eDIHLlIIYFQ,107600,109280,at that i'll put all the links in the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,109280,111920,description but first keep watching or
eDIHLlIIYFQ,111920,115520,else now for our third tip use the magic
eDIHLlIIYFQ,115520,117680,triangle so here's the thing when we're
eDIHLlIIYFQ,117680,119759,drawing poses a lot of people make the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,119759,122399,mistake of not putting enough pizzazz to
eDIHLlIIYFQ,122399,124799,their drawings which makes their art
eDIHLlIIYFQ,124799,127680,boring and stiff what i mean is that the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,127680,130160,character is just standing there doing
eDIHLlIIYFQ,130160,133280,nothing just staring at the void so a
eDIHLlIIYFQ,133280,135920,tip to avoid making your art look stiff
eDIHLlIIYFQ,135920,138800,is to add triangles try to imagine that
eDIHLlIIYFQ,138800,141200,your character's whole body is just a
eDIHLlIIYFQ,141200,143520,giant shape this is called the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,143520,145760,silhouette and there's not much to see
eDIHLlIIYFQ,145760,149840,there huh so add a gap it can be any gap
eDIHLlIIYFQ,149840,151920,in the silhouette listen it's not a
eDIHLlIIYFQ,151920,155200,little triangle okay but it's usually a
eDIHLlIIYFQ,155200,157920,triangle hence it's called the magic
eDIHLlIIYFQ,157920,160720,triangle so the reason why we're putting
eDIHLlIIYFQ,160720,163840,these gaps is to avoid tangents you see
eDIHLlIIYFQ,163840,166400,when two lines overlap like this it can
eDIHLlIIYFQ,166400,170400,make your art look less 3d so like avoid
eDIHLlIIYFQ,170400,173280,tangents as much as possible you can see
eDIHLlIIYFQ,173280,174959,that here when i'm drawing a bunch of
eDIHLlIIYFQ,174959,177120,shapes together and they're literally so
eDIHLlIIYFQ,177120,179200,close to each other it's as if they're
eDIHLlIIYFQ,179200,181040,kissing each other they're making out
eDIHLlIIYFQ,181040,183360,you know now you don't want that because
eDIHLlIIYFQ,183360,186159,that is boring what you want is for one
eDIHLlIIYFQ,186159,188239,of them to be in front of the other so
eDIHLlIIYFQ,188239,190159,that there's like some sort of depth
eDIHLlIIYFQ,190159,192959,going on now going back to the magic
eDIHLlIIYFQ,192959,194879,triangle let's say you want to draw a
eDIHLlIIYFQ,194879,197920,smaxy guy just standing now you don't
eDIHLlIIYFQ,197920,200640,want him to just stand like that this is
eDIHLlIIYFQ,200640,203120,giving me very much yes sir i'll bring
eDIHLlIIYFQ,203120,206879,her back by 7 p.m vibes now this i'm
eDIHLlIIYFQ,206879,210080,making it more dynamic more pizzazz but
eDIHLlIIYFQ,210080,213840,also i also added a magic triangle do
eDIHLlIIYFQ,213840,215840,you see it where is it it's right there
eDIHLlIIYFQ,215840,218959,between the arms and the waist now this
eDIHLlIIYFQ,218959,221200,is giving me your daughter calls me
eDIHLlIIYFQ,221200,224560,daddy to vibes and that's how you do it
eDIHLlIIYFQ,224560,226640,okay so the next tip although this is
eDIHLlIIYFQ,226640,229519,already very common is to add curves to
eDIHLlIIYFQ,229519,231920,your poses no i'm not talking about
eDIHLlIIYFQ,231920,234400,making them thick although you could do
eDIHLlIIYFQ,234400,237360,that i am talking about the gesture that
eDIHLlIIYFQ,237360,239680,poses have a way to make your poses more
eDIHLlIIYFQ,239680,242959,dynamic and interesting is to add curves
eDIHLlIIYFQ,242959,245519,the most interesting poses usually have
eDIHLlIIYFQ,245519,248480,like s curves so you've got this pose
eDIHLlIIYFQ,248480,250560,and it's a pretty interesting pose
eDIHLlIIYFQ,250560,253840,however we can make that so much hotter
eDIHLlIIYFQ,253840,255840,also we can try switching up the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,255840,258479,perspective i'm using the 3d models in
eDIHLlIIYFQ,258479,260639,clip studio paint which you can download
eDIHLlIIYFQ,260639,262560,in the description anyway this is
eDIHLlIIYFQ,262560,264800,basically a cheat if you will that
eDIHLlIIYFQ,264800,267120,allows you to change the perspective of
eDIHLlIIYFQ,267120,268880,the character this is gonna make your
eDIHLlIIYFQ,268880,271919,pose so much more interesting alright so
eDIHLlIIYFQ,271919,274639,for the next tip we are going back to
eDIHLlIIYFQ,274639,277759,basics so we all know this skyline right
eDIHLlIIYFQ,277759,280320,this is the basic guideline that we use
eDIHLlIIYFQ,280320,282800,to draw phases i mean even i still do
eDIHLlIIYFQ,282800,285040,this we've got the circle and the cross
eDIHLlIIYFQ,285040,287680,thing and then the chin but the next
eDIHLlIIYFQ,287680,290160,time you draw these do this so every
eDIHLlIIYFQ,290160,292400,time you draw a face facing anywhere
eDIHLlIIYFQ,292400,294880,except the front just add this little
eDIHLlIIYFQ,294880,297520,line here okay so if you've noticed the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,297520,300320,skull is actually like a little bit flat
eDIHLlIIYFQ,300320,303039,in the sides so it's pretty much longer
eDIHLlIIYFQ,303039,305680,so adding this line right here this is
eDIHLlIIYFQ,305680,307120,going to help you draw the head
eDIHLlIIYFQ,307120,310000,correctly so do this line thing the next
eDIHLlIIYFQ,310000,312720,time you draw heads alright so for our
eDIHLlIIYFQ,312720,316160,next tip draw teardrops as the limbs now
eDIHLlIIYFQ,316160,318800,a lot of beginners just use two parallel
eDIHLlIIYFQ,318800,322080,lines like this to draw arms or legs and
eDIHLlIIYFQ,322080,325039,that is absolutely wrong okay our limbs
eDIHLlIIYFQ,325039,327600,have muscles in them and honestly i
eDIHLlIIYFQ,327600,329919,didn't study anatomy so i have literally
eDIHLlIIYFQ,329919,332880,no idea how muscles look like however
eDIHLlIIYFQ,332880,335840,drawing them as teardrops will help for
eDIHLlIIYFQ,335840,337919,example if you're gonna draw the arm
eDIHLlIIYFQ,337919,340479,just use a big fat teardrop for the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,340479,342800,shoulder thing and then another teardrop
eDIHLlIIYFQ,342800,344880,for the upper arm and then another
eDIHLlIIYFQ,344880,347520,teardrop for the lower arm very
eDIHLlIIYFQ,347520,350639,brilliant technique is it not okay so
eDIHLlIIYFQ,350639,352880,this is somewhat related to my other tip
eDIHLlIIYFQ,352880,355919,in this video however i feel that this
eDIHLlIIYFQ,355919,358720,deserves its own special mention so
eDIHLlIIYFQ,358720,360800,remember when i said that you shouldn't
eDIHLlIIYFQ,360800,363600,draw tangents well this is a very common
eDIHLlIIYFQ,363600,365759,mistake by beginners lots of beginners
eDIHLlIIYFQ,365759,367120,when they're drawing a head in the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,367120,369440,three-fourth angle they kind of tend to
eDIHLlIIYFQ,369440,372000,make the eyes like this right so when
eDIHLlIIYFQ,372000,374080,you're doing eyes in this angle draw
eDIHLlIIYFQ,374080,376800,them instead like this so this shouldn't
eDIHLlIIYFQ,376800,379919,be facing the other way but instead it
eDIHLlIIYFQ,379919,383440,curves like this and not only that it
eDIHLlIIYFQ,383440,385840,shouldn't touch the head because like
eDIHLlIIYFQ,385840,387600,when you draw the eyes so close to the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,387600,390080,head like that it creates a tangent
eDIHLlIIYFQ,390080,392720,which if you remember is bad because it
eDIHLlIIYFQ,392720,395120,looks like they're kissing try to avoid
eDIHLlIIYFQ,395120,397360,drawing your eyes too close to the tip
eDIHLlIIYFQ,397360,399919,of the head and that's all next tip our
eDIHLlIIYFQ,399919,402400,next tip is the pinterest browser
eDIHLlIIYFQ,402400,405840,extension now listen i don't use this
eDIHLlIIYFQ,405840,408400,bad boy often but i promise you it's
eDIHLlIIYFQ,408400,410800,gonna save your butt when you need it
eDIHLlIIYFQ,410800,413199,the most it's like the opposite of
eDIHLlIIYFQ,413199,415759,avatar because like when you needed him
eDIHLlIIYFQ,415759,418479,the most he vanished get it okay i'll
eDIHLlIIYFQ,418479,420960,stop anyway so you could literally save
eDIHLlIIYFQ,420960,423280,any image on pinterest and obviously
eDIHLlIIYFQ,423280,426400,that's already an absolute win but also
eDIHLlIIYFQ,426400,428319,think of the things that you could do
eDIHLlIIYFQ,428319,430240,with that if you ever see cool art on
eDIHLlIIYFQ,430240,432319,twitter that you like you can save it on
eDIHLlIIYFQ,432319,434319,pinterest and then click this little
eDIHLlIIYFQ,434319,437039,magnifying icon right here it's going to
eDIHLlIIYFQ,437039,438000,show
eDIHLlIIYFQ,438000,441919,art that looks similar okay that way you
eDIHLlIIYFQ,441919,444639,can have tons of inspiration the same
eDIHLlIIYFQ,444639,446720,aesthetic stuff like that just make sure
eDIHLlIIYFQ,446720,449199,you credit the artist though obviously
eDIHLlIIYFQ,449199,452720,so for our last tip use thumbnail so
eDIHLlIIYFQ,452720,455360,what are thumbnails no it's not the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,455360,457680,youtube video thumbnail a thumbnail is
eDIHLlIIYFQ,457680,459840,basically a very small version of your
eDIHLlIIYFQ,459840,462800,drawing that you make before you even do
eDIHLlIIYFQ,462800,464560,your drawing this is a must if you're
eDIHLlIIYFQ,464560,466160,just starting out with your drawing
eDIHLlIIYFQ,466160,469120,because it does two things it helps you
eDIHLlIIYFQ,469120,471360,visualize your art and obviously it
eDIHLlIIYFQ,471360,474080,saves your time because the thumbnail is
eDIHLlIIYFQ,474080,475919,really small you don't really have to
eDIHLlIIYFQ,475919,477840,spend a lot of time on it just put the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,477840,479680,overall vibe that you want your drawing
eDIHLlIIYFQ,479680,482160,to have you could even add colors on
eDIHLlIIYFQ,482160,483520,there don't think about the
eDIHLlIIYFQ,483520,485680,technicalities okay because you know
eDIHLlIIYFQ,485680,487599,what guys at the end of the day it's not
eDIHLlIIYFQ,487599,490319,about what looks right it's about what
eDIHLlIIYFQ,490319,493199,looks good so if you enjoyed this video
