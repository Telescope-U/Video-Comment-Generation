69dLyztc-As,0,8610,it's been actually exactly 25 years  since I began business that is like you
69dLyztc-As,8610,17130,marketing in management I started on  October 1 of 1990 that's when I began to
69dLyztc-As,17130,23430,study and back then of course I had no  idea what I will study what I am
69dLyztc-As,23430,30000,supposed to study or what these studies  will provide me or give me what kind of
69dLyztc-As,30000,38399,opportunities I will have well now I'll  try to do that for you
69dLyztc-As,38399,46039,today's lecture will have the following  topics first I will discuss some
69dLyztc-As,46039,55670,foundation courses then business core  courses then business specializations
69dLyztc-As,55670,63769,business extensions and because I've had  over 15 years of teaching experience
69dLyztc-As,63769,72000,education problems how in why business  programs mostly fail around the world
69dLyztc-As,72000,79320,and then I'll have a short conclusion  for you I understand that I have about
69dLyztc-As,79320,84930,45 to 50 minutes to present this and
69dLyztc-As,84930,92909,maybe 15 20 minutes for questions and  discussion now I did not originally know
69dLyztc-As,92909,101939,and I want to make very clear that today  I talk about business education and I
69dLyztc-As,101939,107670,will talk specifically about global  business and global business is very
69dLyztc-As,107670,114240,different from Global Studies global  business is a small field of Global
69dLyztc-As,114240,121680,Studies  Global Studies will include politics it  willing to include global or
69dLyztc-As,121680,127950,international law it will include  culture cultural anthropology Global
69dLyztc-As,127950,135300,Studies is very big I'm focusing first  only on  business basic business is business is
69dLyztc-As,135300,145769,taught in business schools around the  world okay okay so we're business begin
69dLyztc-As,145769,152510,what is the foundation of business in  other words what do you need in terms of
69dLyztc-As,152510,160200,background in order to begin  understanding business and the two areas
69dLyztc-As,160200,166560,that you need to understand is  quantitative methods quantitative
69dLyztc-As,166560,176120,methods basically means math and  economics you need to understand basic
69dLyztc-As,176120,185390,economics before you can do any business  studies so let's a little bit about each
69dLyztc-As,185450,191750,if you're a business student you want to  take basic quantitative methods and
69dLyztc-As,191750,198389,usually we separate these quantitative  methods in two subjects or in two areas
69dLyztc-As,198389,206690,the first air is just business math this  is standard math which is used mostly in
69dLyztc-As,206690,213510,business there is nothing very special  mathematics is a broad field and you're
69dLyztc-As,213510,219019,going to study only those specific  things that are commonly used in
69dLyztc-As,219019,224400,business and of course accounting  finance in general so that's business
69dLyztc-As,224400,231209,math I think you are already or have  already taken business math course the
69dLyztc-As,231209,237319,second one that you do is business  statistics and business statistics is
69dLyztc-As,237319,242630,about analyzing and interpreting data
69dLyztc-As,242630,249359,usually in the real world you will see a  lot of data  maybe interest rates over many many
69dLyztc-As,249359,258959,years  maybe exchange rates over many years  maybe economic growth or if you want to
69dLyztc-As,258959,265320,look at economic growth you may try to  relate the economic growth to investment
69dLyztc-As,265320,271950,or economic growth to consumption or  economic growth in the case of Korea
69dLyztc-As,271950,277500,with exports so statistics will try to
69dLyztc-As,277500,285360,tell your basic relationship which is  let's say in the case of Korea most
69dLyztc-As,285360,293460,important for economic growth of Korea  is it consumption or is it investment or
69dLyztc-As,293460,300840,is it exports you may have many  different theories and you may guess
69dLyztc-As,300840,308100,many different things but with  statistics you can get the data you can
69dLyztc-As,308100,314850,analyze and you can try to discover  relationships and based on the data you
69dLyztc-As,314850,320370,can conclude which is more important or
69dLyztc-As,320370,325650,which is the most important factor in  other words in business statistics have
69dLyztc-As,325650,333870,you already studied basic statistics or  you will have you studied already so
69dLyztc-As,333870,341520,basic statistics will tell you these  relationships okay the second foundation
69dLyztc-As,341520,349470,before you begin real Business Studies  is economics you see if I have the next
69dLyztc-As,349470,358650,slide and economics is divided into of  course over 15 different fields you have
69dLyztc-As,358650,365100,let me just read to microeconomics and  labor economics you have International
69dLyztc-As,365100,372290,Economics yet international trade  international finance you have labor
69dLyztc-As,372290,380880,economics okay you have many different  fields in economics in general basic
69dLyztc-As,380880,386790,economics which we sometimes call  principles of economics or introduction
69dLyztc-As,386790,394860,to economics includes these two fields  microeconomics and macroeconomics you
69dLyztc-As,394860,400470,need these to understand  general business micro economics
69dLyztc-As,400470,405789,concerns the behavior of individuals the
69dLyztc-As,405789,414039,behavior of consumers and the behaviors  of families how families get job their
69dLyztc-As,414039,420430,income how families spend their income  how much they spend on food
69dLyztc-As,420430,428410,how much on cars how much on housing in  other words how families make economic
69dLyztc-As,428410,435910,decisions the economic decisions are  about making money and spending money
69dLyztc-As,435910,441280,respectively investing money in other  words what you do with your money
69dLyztc-As,441280,446590,so that's microeconomics the second part  of microeconomics is about the
69dLyztc-As,446590,453389,businesses you look about one business  how the business is managed
69dLyztc-As,453389,460830,microeconomics tells you how much labour  how much workers to employ how much
69dLyztc-As,460830,468280,capital to employ possibly possibly a  little bit of how much to borrow then it
69dLyztc-As,468280,476169,tells you how much to produce how to  price your product and in general the
69dLyztc-As,476169,485009,main concern for firms is how to  maximize profits about business is about
69dLyztc-As,485009,492940,making money is about making profits in  microeconomics focus is on how to make
69dLyztc-As,492940,500919,maximum profits which usually boils down  to how much to produce and sell and at
69dLyztc-As,500919,506280,what price macro economics is about the
69dLyztc-As,506280,514649,general economy the general economy is  about production and output we call this
69dLyztc-As,514649,520169,GDP gross domestic production is about
69dLyztc-As,520169,528010,labor is an employment we call these  jobs it's about are there a lot of jobs
69dLyztc-As,528010,534600,or a future  next one is about wages are the jobs
69dLyztc-As,534600,540340,well paid or poorly paid okay the next
69dLyztc-As,540340,548070,thing is about interest rate interest  rate is the cost of capital so
69dLyztc-As,548070,554680,macroeconomics concerns about labour in  the cost of labour and capital in the
69dLyztc-As,554680,560530,cost of capital cost of capital is  interest rates and macroeconomics is
69dLyztc-As,560530,565810,concerned about exports and imports and
69dLyztc-As,565810,571750,is concerned about the most important  price in the economy the most important
69dLyztc-As,571750,578490,price of the economy is the price of  money we call the price of money
69dLyztc-As,578490,586120,exchange rate how much the Korean  currency exchanges for Chinese currency
69dLyztc-As,586120,594550,for US dollars for Japanese yen or for  European euro so macroeconomics again is
69dLyztc-As,594550,600120,concerned about employment and wages
69dLyztc-As,600120,606730,about business output in business prices
69dLyztc-As,606730,615100,in other words business profitability  about MP exports imports and exchange
69dLyztc-As,615100,621520,rates this is what macroeconomics is all  about so these are the foundations
69dLyztc-As,621520,628590,before you need to specialize further  into business this is the background
69dLyztc-As,628590,631590,next
69dLyztc-As,633600,644350,next if you study or when you study  business you study four main areas we
69dLyztc-As,644350,652149,can also call them four main fields the  or four main subjects okay the four
69dLyztc-As,652149,657430,fields are accounting finance marketing
69dLyztc-As,657430,665250,and management and I'll discuss each one  of these now accounting is the language
69dLyztc-As,665250,671100,of business is translating business
69dLyztc-As,671100,678970,activity into numbers so that numbers  can everyone understand the trick in
69dLyztc-As,678970,685510,accounting is that you as Koreans can  read a European business accounts and
69dLyztc-As,685510,692589,you can interpret and understand them or  me having studied in the US and come
69dLyztc-As,692589,699399,from Bulgaria can read Korean accounting  statements and understand what they mean
69dLyztc-As,699399,704709,and how we interpret them so let's talk
69dLyztc-As,704709,711000,about each of these accounting is
69dLyztc-As,711000,718450,separated sometimes they call it  principles of accounting sometimes they  call it introduction to accounting the
69dLyztc-As,718450,726940,accounting field is generally separated  in two major sub areas first one is
69dLyztc-As,726940,733420,called financial accounting the second  one is called managerial accounting you
69dLyztc-As,733420,741870,need to learn and understand both this  is the foundation for every business
69dLyztc-As,741870,749470,financial accounting is how you make the  accounts and how you report them how you
69dLyztc-As,749470,754810,report the accounts we call these  financial statements to the owners of
69dLyztc-As,754810,764470,the business to the government to  investors to bankers to creditors in
69dLyztc-As,764470,770260,other words this is account  which is designed for people outside the
69dLyztc-As,770260,775300,firm and it is highly standardized we
69dLyztc-As,775300,781450,have and now almost the whole world uses  what's called international accounting
69dLyztc-As,781450,786700,standards we use them in Bulgaria they  are all used of course in Thailand
69dLyztc-As,786700,791740,they're used in America everywhere in  Europe I'm pretty sure you in Korea and
69dLyztc-As,791740,797410,I I know for sure Japan's using them  China is now introducing them so that
69dLyztc-As,797410,804220,the statements are done here as well as  there and everywhere in the world in the
69dLyztc-As,804220,809950,same way you read them the same way you  make them the same way you interpret
69dLyztc-As,809950,816750,them the same the same way so that's  financial accounting it gives you a
69dLyztc-As,816750,823510,balance sheet with assets and  liabilities it gives you an income
69dLyztc-As,823510,831730,statement with revenues expenses in  profits and it gives you cash flows how
69dLyztc-As,831730,838770,money is coming in and how money is  going out so that's financial accounting
69dLyztc-As,838770,847980,managerial accounting is accounting  designed to serve the needs of
69dLyztc-As,847980,855700,management so that management can make  decisions these are going to be internal
69dLyztc-As,855700,862540,reports they're going to be used by the  CEO and CFO the marketing manager the
69dLyztc-As,862540,869830,production manager they're going to be  used to see what the costs are what is
69dLyztc-As,869830,877260,the cost of a product how to price a  product how much to produce how much
69dLyztc-As,877260,884650,supplies to order it will include  budgets budgets for inventory budgets
69dLyztc-As,884650,891460,for ordering okay it will include all of  those things managerial accounting is
69dLyztc-As,891460,898990,accounting for managerial purposes and  managerial purposes how management makes
69dLyztc-As,898990,906510,the  decisions inside the firm so this is  standard accounting for outsiders and
69dLyztc-As,906510,913560,this is whatever management needs for  decision-making you need to study
69dLyztc-As,913560,921269,accounting first before you study  finance before you study management
69dLyztc-As,921269,929040,before you study marketing and before  you study any other things except of
69dLyztc-As,929040,934980,course math in economics okay so you do  math and economics first then the third
69dLyztc-As,934980,941399,subject is accounting you can do  financial accounting and possibly maybe
69dLyztc-As,941399,948500,you could study marketing or management  in parallel
69dLyztc-As,952110,960200,next is finance in finance focus focus  is on money finance is the subject of
69dLyztc-As,960200,966600,managing money the subject which is  commonly taught and it's usually in all
69dLyztc-As,966600,972240,business school is called financial  management in financial management is
69dLyztc-As,972240,979290,exactly that how you manage money how  you manage business money sometimes this
69dLyztc-As,979290,985680,course is called in many business  schools corporate finance in corporate
69dLyztc-As,985680,993450,finance is how you manage money for big  corporations in other words if you let's
69dLyztc-As,993450,999390,say do accounting books or finance for  Samsung it's got major corporation you
69dLyztc-As,999390,1005180,need corporate finance financial  management and corporate finance is
69dLyztc-As,1005180,1013120,about 90 percent the same corporate  finance has stuff specific to big
69dLyztc-As,1013120,1018860,corporations you generally need  financial management in financial
69dLyztc-As,1018860,1024319,management is how you manage the assets  of the company
69dLyztc-As,1024319,1031069,how you manage liabilities of the  company and the most important part is
69dLyztc-As,1031069,1037459,how you manage investments how you make  investments when you make an investment
69dLyztc-As,1037459,1044780,you want to make proper calculation to  find out is the investment profitable or
69dLyztc-As,1044780,1054280,not profitable what's the return on  investment so finance is focus is on
69dLyztc-As,1054280,1062480,investment but not only okay financial  management is about financing financing
69dLyztc-As,1062480,1069860,means how you get money do you get it by  a bank loan do you borrow money from the
69dLyztc-As,1069860,1077620,bank or do yourself bonds in other words  you borrow money from the bond market or
69dLyztc-As,1077620,1084590,you sell stock which is you raise money  from investors
69dLyztc-As,1084590,1092420,there's certain optimal ratios it's not  good to take too much debt in a very
69dLyztc-As,1092420,1097730,little capital but it's not a good idea  to have too much capital in very little
69dLyztc-As,1097730,1105170,debt there is some optimum some balance  so financial management will do this for
69dLyztc-As,1105170,1110900,you some business schools will usually  have only one financial management
69dLyztc-As,1110900,1118030,course but most business schools will  have two financial management courses
69dLyztc-As,1118030,1124220,sometimes there are smaller call them  fundamentals of financial management
69dLyztc-As,1124220,1131000,which cover maybe 15 or 16 chapters if  the school is very good in very hard
69dLyztc-As,1131000,1136550,they'll cover all fifteen chapters in  one semester in 15 weeks and it's hard
69dLyztc-As,1136550,1141680,but they keep doing it most business  schools around the world in what may
69dLyztc-As,1141680,1148100,mean most students cannot handle 15  chapters in 15 weeks
69dLyztc-As,1148100,1155660,so usually financial management they  cover in the first semester eight  chapters the first eight and in the
69dLyztc-As,1155660,1161540,second semester they cover the other  eight chapters it's a little bit easier
69dLyztc-As,1161540,1168260,so the big subject is separated in part  one in part two and Finance is about
69dLyztc-As,1168260,1175180,again investments next one is marketing
69dLyztc-As,1175180,1181820,marketing again is about the customer  what the customer wants what the
69dLyztc-As,1181820,1188540,customer is willing to pay okay  marketing is about the product what the
69dLyztc-As,1188540,1193580,customer wants again what product they  want do they want a big screen or they
69dLyztc-As,1193580,1201080,want a small screen do they want a heavy  mobile with a large battery or they want
69dLyztc-As,1201080,1206660,it very slim very light but battery life  is no good what the customer wants
69dLyztc-As,1206660,1214670,that's the product the next thing is  price how do we price it okay if it's
69dLyztc-As,1214670,1220460,similar let's say to  Apple iPhone do we price it above do we
69dLyztc-As,1220460,1227810,price it below do we price it at Apple  iPhone in other words you need to think
69dLyztc-As,1227810,1235040,about the competition so you need to  think about your customer the product
69dLyztc-As,1235040,1241370,the features of the product the price  you need to think about the competitors
69dLyztc-As,1241370,1246700,what the competitors are offering unis  also need to think about service
69dLyztc-As,1246700,1253820,customer service that's very important  especially for some customers especially
69dLyztc-As,1253820,1259400,for customers of products that you need  a lot of service like cars cars need a
69dLyztc-As,1259400,1265000,lot of service maybe phones don't need  so much service anymore so this is all
69dLyztc-As,1265000,1270320,marketing sometimes marketing is one
69dLyztc-As,1270320,1278350,huge textbook and it just go half and  half sometimes marketing two is usually
69dLyztc-As,1278350,1284030,separated out as advertising now from
69dLyztc-As,1284030,1290710,the previous screen I think I forgot  sometimes financial management to is
69dLyztc-As,1290710,1296750,separated out as a separate course  called investments so instead of two you
69dLyztc-As,1296750,1303440,get investments for marketing  instead of marketing to they just call
69dLyztc-As,1303440,1310250,it advertising and you learn all the  tricks about advertising advertising is
69dLyztc-As,1310250,1318410,about making the customer to like to  want and to eventually buy your product
69dLyztc-As,1318410,1324410,okay against about advertising campaigns  and promotions in all the other things
69dLyztc-As,1324410,1329630,that will make the customer buy your  product so that's what marketing is
69dLyztc-As,1329630,1336740,about and next one is management not  necessarily the last one management
69dLyztc-As,1336740,1345710,again is about how businesses make  decisions decisions are about planning
69dLyztc-As,1345710,1352760,how do we plan how much we're going to  produce how  much we're going to order how many
69dLyztc-As,1352760,1358820,people we will need the management of  people's got a special name it's called
69dLyztc-As,1358820,1365480,a Personnel Management it's considered  very important and usually instead of
69dLyztc-As,1365480,1371260,having management - they'll separate and  have a whole subject called Personnel
69dLyztc-As,1371260,1378100,Management Management is let me repeat  about planning it's also about
69dLyztc-As,1378100,1385700,organizing how we're going to organize  what departments we're going to have  when a marketing department in finance
69dLyztc-As,1385700,1391670,department and accounting department in  a production department and a personnel
69dLyztc-As,1391670,1399590,department in a legal department and IT  or computer technology department so
69dLyztc-As,1399590,1406730,what kind of departments we're going to  have management is about leadership how
69dLyztc-As,1406730,1411770,to lead people how to manage people how
69dLyztc-As,1411770,1418480,to organize people one of the most  important part in businesses is how to
69dLyztc-As,1418480,1425960,motivate people and of course how to  reward people what kind of salaries what
69dLyztc-As,1425960,1431570,kind of vacations you're going to give  them and all the other thing whatever is  necessary
69dLyztc-As,1431570,1437960,and finally management is about control  are going to put a camera and watch the
69dLyztc-As,1437960,1444200,people are they going to have a card  every time they walk in they slide their  card in other words you keep track of
69dLyztc-As,1444200,1450920,their time are they going to give you  weekly reports monthly reports annual
69dLyztc-As,1450920,1456980,reports in other words how you control  how you make sure that you achieve your
69dLyztc-As,1456980,1463340,goals how you make sure that employees  do their job appropriately
69dLyztc-As,1463340,1469790,that's what management is about in these  four fields accounting finance marketing
69dLyztc-As,1469790,1479080,and management consists the core once  you got the core the main education
69dLyztc-As,1480100,1487240,oh there's one more once you get the  core the big wants to get the core the
69dLyztc-As,1487240,1492370,capstone the most important the most  difficult course the course that
69dLyztc-As,1492370,1499030,requires understanding all the other for  understanding accounting and finance and
69dLyztc-As,1499030,1505420,marketing and management is called  strategic management strategic
69dLyztc-As,1505420,1510520,management is how you competes are going
69dLyztc-As,1510520,1517000,to compete on efficiency are going to  compete on price are going to compete on
69dLyztc-As,1517000,1522760,a better product are going to compete on  a variety of products you know the basic
69dLyztc-As,1522760,1530520,thing that you can think the simplest  and easiest that you can understand is  how Samsung Galaxy will compete against
69dLyztc-As,1530520,1536470,iPhone is going to be bigger screen  better Valarie battery whatever the
69dLyztc-As,1536470,1544480,fioors is going to be a different  operating system more free software in  other words how you compete it's also
69dLyztc-As,1544480,1552010,how you innovate how you innovate your  products okay so all of this is called a
69dLyztc-As,1552010,1558910,capstone capstone means the top means  the most important the one which builds
69dLyztc-As,1558910,1567330,on all the others  that's the capstone course and let's see
69dLyztc-As,1567840,1575730,specializations once you have your core  you can specialize in there are four
69dLyztc-As,1575730,1581710,primary specializations you can  specialize in accounting and those that
69dLyztc-As,1581710,1586960,specialize in accounting are simply  going to take four or five or six more
69dLyztc-As,1586960,1592060,accounting courses in other words you  take the basics of accounting finance
69dLyztc-As,1592060,1597930,marketing management and then you focus  on accounting you're going to do after
69dLyztc-As,1597930,1605710,introductory accounting to do  intermediate accounting intermediate  accounting is hard the textbook is that
69dLyztc-As,1605710,1611740,"like 1,500 pages it's a killer Oh"
69dLyztc-As,1611740,1619540,that's why accounting people get or make  a lot of money it's very hard a lot of
69dLyztc-As,1619540,1624760,accounting majors just fail on  intermediate accounting so they take it
69dLyztc-As,1624760,1631330,year-long two semesters after they do  accounting sorry intermediate financial
69dLyztc-As,1631330,1639400,accounting they'll do cost accounting  and cost accounting will go in a lot  more detail of managerial accounting how
69dLyztc-As,1639400,1646500,we determine costs and all the other  tricks related to the cost inside the  business not with businesses about
69dLyztc-As,1646500,1655290,revenues and expenses cost accounting  focuses on the expenses only that's it
69dLyztc-As,1655290,1661750,you'll do some auditing all the thing is  trying to check and verify if your
69dLyztc-As,1661750,1668470,accounting is good is proper it's  correct if there is cheating if there is
69dLyztc-As,1668470,1675010,fraud if someone's stealing money okay  or if someone is called cooking the
69dLyztc-As,1675010,1683350,books in other words they're lying and  cheating trying to mislead you methods  the management or external people so
69dLyztc-As,1683350,1689860,that's what auditing is and of course  you have nonprofit institutions you have
69dLyztc-As,1689860,1695280,also government institutions Government  Accounting is a little difference
69dLyztc-As,1695280,1701200,nonprofit institutions are also a little  bit different they not run for-profit so
69dLyztc-As,1701200,1707980,there have a separate accounting of  their own and just not to mislead you
69dLyztc-As,1707980,1713440,there may be more one two three four  more courses but if you take business
69dLyztc-As,1713440,1719680,and you have a field usually four or  five extra courses are enough to have
69dLyztc-As,1719680,1726040,the field similar with finance you can  take financial management too or you can
69dLyztc-As,1726040,1732760,do investments or you can do Financial  Economics and other learn worth learn
69dLyztc-As,1732760,1739270,about financial markets financial  institutions financial instruments you
69dLyztc-As,1739270,1746810,have separate ones called financial  derivatives this is very advanced  very difficult very sophisticated and
69dLyztc-As,1746810,1751820,you may have a separate course about  that if you specialize in finance and of
69dLyztc-As,1751820,1759440,course risk management how you manage  your financial risks or operations and
69dLyztc-As,1759440,1766250,production risk risk management includes  a subfield of insurance if you're a big
69dLyztc-As,1766250,1771710,business how you insure your different  risks well first of all which are your
69dLyztc-As,1771710,1776840,risk you need to know your risk you need  to understand your risk you need to
69dLyztc-As,1776840,1783080,measure them in the last piece you need  to manage them or insure them with
69dLyztc-As,1783080,1788300,marketing again you may have many  different courses you can specialize in
69dLyztc-As,1788300,1794630,advertising take a separate course on  advertising you can get a separate  course on sales okay a lot of people in
69dLyztc-As,1794630,1800030,marketing they just do sales like a car  salesman or phone salesman or whatever
69dLyztc-As,1800030,1806780,you're selling okay  you could be product design how do we  make it better how do we make it more
69dLyztc-As,1806780,1811910,user-friendly what do they like  you know that's product design and of
69dLyztc-As,1811910,1817820,course marketing management how you  manage the marketing operations and
69dLyztc-As,1817820,1825980,there could be a bunch of other  marketing courses and with management  first how we manage people
69dLyztc-As,1825980,1831710,it's called Personnel Management how we  manage inventory called
69dLyztc-As,1831710,1838160,inventory management how we manage the  marketing marketing management very
69dLyztc-As,1838160,1844370,popular course is supply chain  management how you manage the supply
69dLyztc-As,1844370,1852260,chain there is another course sometimes  in here sometimes a separate course  called operations management how you
69dLyztc-As,1852260,1857750,manage your business operations whatever  you're doing okay you may be managing a
69dLyztc-As,1857750,1863920,hotel or a restaurant or a car  manufacturer and of course any other
69dLyztc-As,1863920,1868960,management so to summarize business
69dLyztc-As,1868960,1874640,specializations these are the four main  the four primary specializations after
69dLyztc-As,1874640,1882289,you've done your core you  take four or five of these within one  specific area and then you specialize in
69dLyztc-As,1882289,1889120,those there is an alternative  specialization which is instead of
69dLyztc-As,1889120,1894280,accounting business specializing it  could it be specializing in it
69dLyztc-As,1894280,1901909,international business right this is  what you're I understand doing and there
69dLyztc-As,1901909,1907250,is no difference between saying  international business and global
69dLyztc-As,1907250,1914419,business international Global means the  same so if you're studying in your case
69dLyztc-As,1914419,1922580,maybe a global business what do I think  is a good global business education how
69dLyztc-As,1922580,1928640,do we structure it well very simple you  will have or should have a course in
69dLyztc-As,1928640,1933770,International Economics in other words  the first course we had microeconomics
69dLyztc-As,1933770,1939700,and macroeconomics now you're going to  get international trade and
69dLyztc-As,1939700,1945799,international finance so International  Economics deals with international trade
69dLyztc-As,1945799,1952730,and finance a subject which is very  important for export oriented country
69dLyztc-As,1952730,1959260,like Korea again the next course is  accounting you're going to get a
69dLyztc-As,1959260,1965049,specialization international accounting  how you do accounting for we call this
69dLyztc-As,1965049,1971690,global accounting accounting for a  company that has global operations in
69dLyztc-As,1971690,1978950,many different countries how you take  the accounting of five different  countries and put it all together how
69dLyztc-As,1978950,1986390,you deal with currencies and currencies  going up and down in other words  accounting for global corporations is a
69dLyztc-As,1986390,1993980,little trickier and you learn those  tricks here similarly you take a finance
69dLyztc-As,1993980,2000000,and finance for global corporations we  call these multinational corporations
69dLyztc-As,2000000,2005110,has its own tricks has its own  complications you just call it
69dLyztc-As,2005110,2012540,international finance okay  or how you manage the finances of
69dLyztc-As,2012540,2019270,multinational corporations  similarly with marketing not with you
69dLyztc-As,2019270,2025600,take each of the four cores core courses  accounting and into international
69dLyztc-As,2025600,2030700,accounting finance get international  finance marketing you do international
69dLyztc-As,2030700,2036160,marketing in management you know  International Management and I would
69dLyztc-As,2036160,2043030,think maybe not necessary but it's nice  it's very good and it's very helpful if
69dLyztc-As,2043030,2050530,you do an extra course international law  if you're doing business understanding
69dLyztc-As,2050530,2059110,at least some law is helpful is nice  it's important so this is my view of how
69dLyztc-As,2059110,2064179,I would structure an international sorry
69dLyztc-As,2064179,2071260,yeah international business program of  course you can add more courses  international politics and all sorts of
69dLyztc-As,2071260,2077919,other things but this is the basics now
69dLyztc-As,2077919,2083740,what other extensions you may have what  are not what you've done your core
69dLyztc-As,2083740,2088780,you've done our specialization but if  you want to get a little further and
69dLyztc-As,2088780,2096669,there is usually time in a business  school you may study some programming  languages especially important is to
69dLyztc-As,2096669,2102850,learn at least one statistical  programming language in other words you
69dLyztc-As,2102850,2108910,have many statistical softwares and the  statistical software usually have a
69dLyztc-As,2108910,2114400,basics of non basic meaning some simple  programming language so that you can
69dLyztc-As,2114400,2120970,learn how to program statistical  software so learning some programming
69dLyztc-As,2120970,2127660,languages is very helpful especially  statistical type languages there are
69dLyztc-As,2127660,2132730,many statistical packages maybe one or
69dLyztc-As,2132730,2140140,two of those is helpful next database  systems it always helps to know and
69dLyztc-As,2140140,2149559,understand  databases information is what you need  to manage and make decisions and
69dLyztc-As,2149559,2155660,information is usually stored in  databases so understanding databases and
69dLyztc-As,2155660,2162890,database systems is always helpful not  necessary but it's a good idea
69dLyztc-As,2162890,2169220,well one way that it's done or another  little broader subject which is usually
69dLyztc-As,2169220,2177680,done in most business schools in the  world is called Mis management  information systems and part of
69dLyztc-As,2177680,2186920,information system will include of  course database systems but it will  include security connectivity it's going
69dLyztc-As,2186920,2192609,to include whatever is related to  technology and technology being used in
69dLyztc-As,2192609,2200690,businesses it's a fairly helpful course  to have and it's a separate you may have
69dLyztc-As,2200690,2205730,web systems or internet systems how to  use the internet for marketing
69dLyztc-As,2205730,2212480,management or whatever the things are  that you may do and of course in general
69dLyztc-As,2212480,2217759,I'm talking about  also general languages whether it's
69dLyztc-As,2217759,2226359,English which is today the language of  all business around the world and of  course tourism now the rising star is
69dLyztc-As,2226359,2235759,Chinese Japanese has been always popular  and possibly Arabic which is more exotic
69dLyztc-As,2235759,2241539,okay so these are business extensions
69dLyztc-As,2243289,2249209,okay you may have a business extension  in law you may study a little bit
69dLyztc-As,2249209,2255449,further law like introduction to law  it's nice to have it's also very nice to
69dLyztc-As,2255449,2262679,have business law again it's not part of  the core but it's a nice extension you
69dLyztc-As,2262679,2268739,may have specifically contract law how  to make and manage contracts this one is
69dLyztc-As,2268739,2275939,tricky because contract law in Japan is  going to be different from Korea  different from China different from
69dLyztc-As,2275939,2281369,Bulgaria different from America so  contract law is not the same around the
69dLyztc-As,2281369,2290029,world and maybe some international law  so you may extend into the area of law
69dLyztc-As,2291289,2297569,so I'm trying now to summarize I've  already discussed all of these things
69dLyztc-As,2297569,2303749,this is a simple table that you're  having you may have within the field so
69dLyztc-As,2303749,2312179,you're going to have let's say for an  international business what would you at  least study is the basics well for
69dLyztc-As,2312179,2319380,quantitative stuff business math and  statistics maybe you can take a third  course maybe not maybe you can take
69dLyztc-As,2319380,2325619,statistical packages and statistical  programming is number three it's not on
69dLyztc-As,2325619,2333269,there next for economics microeconomics  macroeconomics and international
69dLyztc-As,2333269,2339630,economics which includes international  finance and trade accounting financial
69dLyztc-As,2339630,2344789,accounting managerial accounting and  international or global accounting I'm
69dLyztc-As,2344789,2352589,just putting it all together this is  just the same information in one table  for convenience finance financial
69dLyztc-As,2352589,2357630,management maybe financial management  tool or investments international
69dLyztc-As,2357630,2365900,finance marketing one maybe advertising  or marketing to international marketing
69dLyztc-As,2365900,2370970,management management one personnel  management international manager
69dLyztc-As,2370970,2377720,and possibly for others you may include  some Mis or maybe business law or maybe
69dLyztc-As,2377720,2384770,international law that's again the core  you can extend in different ways up to
69dLyztc-As,2384770,2392079,your choices or up to the goals of the  university or the goals of the
69dLyztc-As,2392079,2399560,administration let's see what else we  have I should be okay that's my last
69dLyztc-As,2399560,2405530,section well I've been teaching both  Business and Economics for about 15
69dLyztc-As,2405530,2414770,years in eight different countries and  I've seen a lot of programs fail or a
69dLyztc-As,2414770,2421369,lot of programs aren't doing very well a  lot of programs are mediocre of course
69dLyztc-As,2421369,2427430,some Pro programs succeed so what are  the typical problems what really you
69dLyztc-As,2427430,2432800,have to be careful about or watch about  or what are the common mistakes number
69dLyztc-As,2432800,2438770,one  it's very simple weak foundations they  study a lot of business but they don't
69dLyztc-As,2438770,2443990,know basic accounting well they somehow  study accounting but don't learn
69dLyztc-As,2443990,2449510,anything about the counting okay  that's the most common mistake they
69dLyztc-As,2449510,2457819,study accounting to actually pass the  exam they pass the exam and they forgot
69dLyztc-As,2457819,2464569,about it this is known in education is  the toilet flush you know it's a toilet
69dLyztc-As,2464569,2470030,right you know what's a flush students  study study study study learn when the
69dLyztc-As,2470030,2477260,exam comes they pass they flush and  everything goes down the toilet and they  forget everything don't remember
69dLyztc-As,2477260,2483890,anything anymore okay so weak  foundations they don't understand basic
69dLyztc-As,2483890,2490310,finance that's very common they just say  oh I'm a marketing guy I don't need to
69dLyztc-As,2490310,2496460,know finance and that's a very common  mistake of thinking culture and
69dLyztc-As,2496460,2504610,mentality especially of an 18 or 19  year old kid you know when you're 30 say
69dLyztc-As,2504610,2513330,oh I should have learned better  accounting I should have learned better  finance so don't underestimate the
69dLyztc-As,2513330,2520570,foundation that's the first one the  second common mistake and that's very  common I've seen it everywhere is many
69dLyztc-As,2520570,2527890,fancy course fancy course is a course  which sounds very nice it sounds very
69dLyztc-As,2527890,2534310,modern it's got a little bit of a  contact contents but it's not big enough
69dLyztc-As,2534310,2539890,it's not broad enough they just feature  a little bit about this and that's it
69dLyztc-As,2539890,2548080,like promotion strategies and that's a  whole course well that stuff you study  for a week or two so instead of another
69dLyztc-As,2548080,2554200,let me emphasize focusing on the  foundations in the core they provide a
69dLyztc-As,2554200,2562330,lot of little courses that only look at  a few things the third one which I've
69dLyztc-As,2562330,2568630,seen a lot and I mean a lot almost  everywhere is few course chapters they
69dLyztc-As,2568630,2574650,study accounting in the study five  chapters oh five chapters is not enough
69dLyztc-As,2574650,2583570,studying five chapters you're not going  to learn a lot of accounting you're  going to learn some but it's little when
69dLyztc-As,2583570,2590040,I was studying at one University and we  teach finance students study four
69dLyztc-As,2590040,2597250,chapters in financial management in one  semester and then four chapter in the
69dLyztc-As,2597250,2602410,next semester well how far you're going  to go so then financial management one
69dLyztc-As,2602410,2610390,two three and four and for two years  they study one textbook that has 16
69dLyztc-As,2610390,2616420,chapters  well that's not exactly good education  where a textbook that is taught in one
69dLyztc-As,2616420,2623110,or two semesters you spread over four  semesters you need to cover on average
69dLyztc-As,2623110,2629800,about ten chapters per semester whether  its marketing management accounting good
69dLyztc-As,2629800,2636960,universities will typically cover 15 in  bad universities will cover  or seven but teaching we're studying
69dLyztc-As,2636960,2643910,three four or five chapters is a joke  and that's very common around the world
69dLyztc-As,2643910,2649470,the next one which I've seen is too many  project it's like the marketing teacher
69dLyztc-As,2649470,2655859,loves to give students a project right  so it gives them a project but  management teacher also gives them a
69dLyztc-As,2655859,2661950,project oh and the finance teacher gives  them a project and suddenly every
69dLyztc-As,2661950,2667559,teacher gives them a project and the  students like I have five five projects
69dLyztc-As,2667559,2672569,and they're doing the project copy the  projects and they forgot what they're
69dLyztc-As,2672569,2677940,about and they forgot that they gotta  actually sit and learn and understand so
69dLyztc-As,2677940,2683730,the learning is not very important it's  about make the project deliver the
69dLyztc-As,2683730,2689809,project and of course with the projects  come presentations and students focus on
69dLyztc-As,2689809,2695700,ten minute presentation so the whole  semester they study to make a ten minute
69dLyztc-As,2695700,2701940,presentation all right on the project  instead of learning all the important
69dLyztc-As,2701940,2707630,stuff so that's actually not fault for  the students that's fall for the
69dLyztc-As,2707630,2714480,teachers in the department in general  that's fault of the organization same
69dLyztc-As,2714480,2719539,thing heavily weighted projects heavily  weighted project means the project is
69dLyztc-As,2719539,2724950,fifty percent of the grade and again  when it's 50 percent do you have similar
69dLyztc-As,2724950,2731039,courses now here you got a course and  half of the grade is on the project well
69dLyztc-As,2731039,2737880,when half the grade is on the project  the students focus on the project and  they ignore the other stuff if you get
69dLyztc-As,2737880,2743249,the project well then you make your  presentation you're going to get most of  your grade you don't have to study the
69dLyztc-As,2743249,2751140,rest well that's a common design problem  well it's actually designed to make
69dLyztc-As,2751140,2756680,students pass quickly and easily in  students pass and they get good grades
69dLyztc-As,2756680,2762779,but they don't learn much it's not about  learning it's not passing the grades and
69dLyztc-As,2762779,2770250,making it easy for students well II  it is not necessarily good let me see
69dLyztc-As,2770250,2775830,what else yes same thing poor and easy  exams again this is mostly a fault of
69dLyztc-As,2775830,2782070,the professors and of course the last  one is everyone's passing nobody is
69dLyztc-As,2782070,2788250,failing if you know that you're not  going to fail because we don't fail  anybody the result is you don't study
69dLyztc-As,2788250,2794910,much let's see what else cuz I'm running  out of time ok these are very quickly
69dLyztc-As,2794910,2800400,maybe you some maybe use many of these  the most common one is called memorizing
69dLyztc-As,2800400,2808170,you sit and you memorize right before  the exam the night before the exam you
69dLyztc-As,2808170,2815130,do this now in Thailand they don't study  the night before the exam they studied  the morning before the exam so the
69dLyztc-As,2815130,2824640,example is 11 o'clock they started 9 in  10 o'clock  quickly they come on the exam you don't  learn a lot by memorizing and cramming
69dLyztc-As,2824640,2829770,usually whatever you learn by the  afternoon it's all forgotten ok the next
69dLyztc-As,2829770,2837270,one is study from PowerPoint very common  students loved PowerPoint and then they
69dLyztc-As,2837270,2844460,just read the PowerPoint and said you  cannot get education from PowerPoint
69dLyztc-As,2844460,2851160,PowerPoint is not meant for study  PowerPoint is meant for presentation to
69dLyztc-As,2851160,2859320,make a presentation easier but you can't  study you can't get an education from  PowerPoint of course not reading the
69dLyztc-As,2859320,2865890,textbook most students around the world  especially in poor what meaning low
69dLyztc-As,2865890,2871710,quality business programs they don't  read the textbook well if you want to
69dLyztc-As,2871710,2877050,learn you gotta read it's simple as that  the only way to learn is with good
69dLyztc-As,2877050,2882240,reading you need to train your skills to  read to analyze and all the other things
69dLyztc-As,2882240,2890280,you're just thinking oh if I listen to  the lecture if I take notes no you need  to read the book not enough exercises
69dLyztc-As,2890280,2895500,this applies mainly for accounting  accounting needs exercises for each
69dLyztc-As,2895500,2903089,chapter you need to solve five or ten  problems ok  very important next one is big group
69dLyztc-As,2903089,2908200,exercises they give you an exercise and  they put six people on the group what
69dLyztc-As,2908200,2913359,happens is one student works in the  other one play the phone or chatting or
69dLyztc-As,2913359,2919390,talking or you know that's that's a  group should be two people at maximum
69dLyztc-As,2919390,2925630,three four or more is usually one or two  the students don't really work that much
69dLyztc-As,2925630,2931420,and that's the same thing as group free  writing free writing is you get the
69dLyztc-As,2931420,2939430,benefit without doing the work so for  example the four of you work on the same  project and maybe two or three work hard
69dLyztc-As,2939430,2947200,and one will don't work hard okay of  course too much fun too much party
69dLyztc-As,2947200,2953640,that's already known too much internet  too much Facebook too much chatting okay
69dLyztc-As,2953640,2958890,so now I'm asking my students in Kyllo  how much time you spend on average on
69dLyztc-As,2958890,2966490,Facebook four hours well when do you  study well you know there I might put on
69dLyztc-As,2966490,2973000,a lot of time to study okay  so too much fun and another one study
69dLyztc-As,2973000,2978519,for grades only you started just to get  a well that's you know you don't need
69dLyztc-As,2978519,2985930,that in grades it's not as important  it's the knowledge is understanding the  business and finally I've seen it a lot
69dLyztc-As,2985930,2992049,I don't know why but it's a problem more  of an Asian phenomenon as opposed to
69dLyztc-As,2992049,2998890,European or American kids go to business  because mom and dad think it's a good
69dLyztc-As,2998890,3004380,idea so mom and dad want you to study  business you go and study business to
69dLyztc-As,3004380,3011460,make parents happy maybe you don't care  about business maybe you like I don't  know drawing or painting or photography
69dLyztc-As,3011460,3019079,or art or history or something else you  like but you don't go to study what you  like you study what your parents want
69dLyztc-As,3019079,3025710,you to study so this makes for poor  motivation students are not motivated go
69dLyztc-As,3025710,3032810,let me try and finish before  can all right conclusion business study
69dLyztc-As,3032810,3039830,is general not easy people think it's  easy but it's not there are too many
69dLyztc-As,3039830,3048230,business programs everywhere around the  world and the field is competitive and  maybe in career more than 100 business
69dLyztc-As,3048230,3053540,programs in general I mean I know in  Thailand there are 100 I know in Taiwan
69dLyztc-As,3053540,3059780,during 100 so you gotta be good because  if you're not good someone else will be
69dLyztc-As,3059780,3066290,and will have a job for you and a lot of  times students underestimate reality oh  they just want a little bit of marketing
69dLyztc-As,3066290,3072680,I'm ok well short answer is you're  probably not going to be ok so most
69dLyztc-As,3072680,3078290,students fail meaning they graduate they  didn't learn much and what they do they
69dLyztc-As,3078290,3085450,go for a master's degree ok ok just  waste more time next one
69dLyztc-As,3085450,3090590,most students when they graduate they  can't get a job meaning they can't get a
69dLyztc-As,3090590,3096410,good well-paying job yes they get a job  and they become a bartender they get a
69dLyztc-As,3096410,3102050,job and become a secretary but again do  you study for 4 years in business to be
69dLyztc-As,3102050,3110030,a secretary or to be a bartender or to  be a waiter  ok or to be a hotel receptionist and the
69dLyztc-As,3110030,3115850,answer is no we don't study four years  for that but that's what most people do
69dLyztc-As,3115850,3121040,and I heard it and I've been in many  countries the same thing oh there are no
69dLyztc-As,3121040,3126170,jobs there are no jobs when we graduate  and I heard especially this in Bahrain
69dLyztc-As,3126170,3133700,they said oh there are no jobs doesn't  matter what in the short answer is no  there are plenty of jobs but the jobs
69dLyztc-As,3133700,3138770,are only for the skilled people so it  turns out that especially when I was
69dLyztc-As,3138770,3145310,teaching in Bahrain but in other places  for the good students let's say I have a  class of fifty maybe six or seven will
69dLyztc-As,3145310,3150500,be top students these six or seven will  already get a good well-paying job
69dLyztc-As,3150500,3155690,waiting for them and the others don't  have a job at all in other words for the
69dLyztc-As,3155690,3160880,good students there are always good  well-paying job
69dLyztc-As,3160880,3170030,and for the poor students there's simply  no jobs and I would like to conclude by
69dLyztc-As,3170030,3176960,wishing you good luck in your business  education and we have a little bit of
69dLyztc-As,3176960,3184700,time if you have any questions maybe you
69dLyztc-As,3184700,3190160,have some questions please don't be shy  don't worry you've any questions or
69dLyztc-As,3190160,3196960,concerns or you're curious about  something please don't hesitate to ask
69dLyztc-As,3198010,3208040,yes it's very simple good students study
69dLyztc-As,3208040,3215810,regularly consistently throughout the  semester and the good student reads the
69dLyztc-As,3215810,3221840,textbook and of course pays attention in  the best student just the bad student  they just come to class they look
69dLyztc-As,3221840,3227000,quickly they prepare before the exam and  of course the big difference is what
69dLyztc-As,3227000,3232430,they remember two weeks after the exam  two weeks after the exam the good
69dLyztc-As,3232430,3237440,student remembers most of the stuff and  the bad student doesn't the other big
69dLyztc-As,3237440,3246920,difference is good students try to  understand and bad students just  memorize its primary difference more
69dLyztc-As,3246920,3251770,questions on the back
69dLyztc-As,3252309,3259039,in this area I haven't been able to  actually spend it looks at you any
69dLyztc-As,3259039,3265309,questions no yeah
69dLyztc-As,3265309,3272420,that's very common here especially in  Asian students don't ask questions  they just sit quietly well if you got a
69dLyztc-As,3272420,3279229,question you got to learn to ask you got  to learn to ask questions you got to  learn to be active you got to learn to
69dLyztc-As,3279229,3286450,be proactive you got to be curious any  other questions
69dLyztc-As,3289359,3294559,yes please  I personally don't know what which thing
69dLyztc-As,3294559,3301150,is the important thing which is not  important thing so I think they were  writing it though
69dLyztc-As,3301150,3306319,no the short answer is definitely not we
69dLyztc-As,3306319,3312049,have done this long time ago  memorization was the way of education of
69dLyztc-As,3312049,3318130,"the West 2,000 years ago we did that"
69dLyztc-As,3318130,3324950,"2,000 years ago we did it for many  hundreds of years and we know that it"
69dLyztc-As,3324950,3331849,doesn't work as well okay and again if  you don't know what's important that's
69dLyztc-As,3331849,3338209,got two things first you think to find  out what's important but you can't you
69dLyztc-As,3338209,3343339,ask the professor that's what the  professor's job is to tell you what is
69dLyztc-As,3343339,3348619,more important and to tell you what is  less important that's what you asked the
69dLyztc-As,3348619,3356599,teacher hey which are the most important  things that I need to learn in the rainy  just memorizing is very common but
69dLyztc-As,3356599,3362119,doesn't help you much you just pass the  exam but next time doesn't help so much
69dLyztc-As,3362119,3370069,that's a very common distinction between  Western students and Eastern students
69dLyztc-As,3370069,3376940,"again we've had universities 2,000 years  ago 1,000 years ago for thousands of"
69dLyztc-As,3376940,3383599,years we have this experience and we  know what works and what doesn't work  back in the old days where the
69dLyztc-As,3383599,3391849,discussion with the Dean universities in  the West were established at the library
69dLyztc-As,3391849,3397459,whenever you have a library you make a  university because university is based
69dLyztc-As,3397459,3405380,on books and is based on reading books  that's how you get education more
69dLyztc-As,3405380,3412869,questions you have a third chance all  right another one
69dLyztc-As,3417440,3424430,because because  last questions no okay well thank you
69dLyztc-As,3424430,3426880,very much
