Dr970XU05tM,320,2450,- Since the beginning of time
Dr970XU05tM,2450,4300,"or rather, fashion,"
Dr970XU05tM,4300,7340,American clothing manufacturers were taking detailed notes
Dr970XU05tM,7340,11380,"on colors, cuts and trends from their European peers."
Dr970XU05tM,11380,13880,"That is until World War II,"
Dr970XU05tM,13880,16980,when the occupation and subsequent blackout of Paris
Dr970XU05tM,16980,21260,"gave America no choice, but to well, start from sketch."
Dr970XU05tM,21260,24090,"And today, American fashion is setting the tone"
Dr970XU05tM,24090,26650,for a never before seen future.
Dr970XU05tM,26650,28360,But how did we get here?
Dr970XU05tM,28360,31110,"I am Hamish Bowles, international editor at large"
Dr970XU05tM,31110,32160,at American Vogue.
Dr970XU05tM,32160,34880,And I'm here to tell you everything you need to know
Dr970XU05tM,34880,37840,about the history of American fashion.
Dr970XU05tM,37840,40640,"Our story starts with Claire McCardell,"
Dr970XU05tM,40640,43040,the mother of American sportswear.
Dr970XU05tM,43040,46240,Her five easy pieces were born out of the necessity
Dr970XU05tM,46240,49960,to have easy interchangeable items for life on the go.
Dr970XU05tM,49960,52610,Quite a departure from the fussy and labor intensive
Dr970XU05tM,52610,54470,designs seen in Europe.
Dr970XU05tM,54470,58530,McCardell entered the ease and pockets of men's clothing.
Dr970XU05tM,58530,60500,She cut wrinkle-free wool on the buyers
Dr970XU05tM,60500,63030,"for a more flowing, comfortable fit."
Dr970XU05tM,63030,66659,Her debut Monastic dress sold out in a day.
Dr970XU05tM,66660,68670,Where it offered American women a washable
Dr970XU05tM,68670,70220,"re-wearable dress,"
Dr970XU05tM,70220,72893,a holy grail of modern accessible fashion.
Dr970XU05tM,74200,78130,"In 1944, McCardell along with designers, Bonnie Cashin,"
Dr970XU05tM,78130,80990,and a very young Anne Klein where a design trio
Dr970XU05tM,80990,84220,that shaped the foundation for American ready to wear.
Dr970XU05tM,84220,86290,But that's not to say European couture
Dr970XU05tM,86290,88840,didn't have a place on American soil.
Dr970XU05tM,88840,91859,Several designers remained true to custom tailoring.
Dr970XU05tM,91860,95590,"Such as Hollywood's Adrian, high society's Mainbocher,"
Dr970XU05tM,95590,98049,"and Norell, the king of Seventh Avenue,"
Dr970XU05tM,98050,100330,"famed for his flapper style silhouettes,"
Dr970XU05tM,100330,102060,"mid century shammies dresses,"
Dr970XU05tM,102060,105049,and of course his iconic mermaid dress.
Dr970XU05tM,105050,108800,"And if the 1940s where the infancy of American sportswear,"
Dr970XU05tM,108800,111880,then the '50s and '60s where it's adolescent years.
Dr970XU05tM,111880,115430,"And as with most teenagers, it was an era of growth,"
Dr970XU05tM,115430,117873,"change, and a healthy amount of rebellion."
Dr970XU05tM,118750,121710,Charles James was one such champion of innovation.
Dr970XU05tM,121710,124040,"His rigid structures and layered creations,"
Dr970XU05tM,124040,126740,"inspired contemporary designers like Christian Dior,"
Dr970XU05tM,126740,129039,"and future generations, including Halston,"
Dr970XU05tM,129039,130920,"and later, Zac Posen."
Dr970XU05tM,130920,133959,"To Charles James, we own thanks for the wrap dress,"
Dr970XU05tM,133960,137330,"down jackets, and '80s approved shoulder pads."
Dr970XU05tM,137330,139570,Not to mention the first sports bra.
Dr970XU05tM,139570,142256,"Women on jogs across the globe thank you for your service,"
Dr970XU05tM,142256,143088,Charles.
Dr970XU05tM,144820,146760,Leather goods and accessories too
Dr970XU05tM,146760,149810,sprinted into the limelight in the 1960s.
Dr970XU05tM,149810,153560,Bonnie Cashin created the wildly popular shopping bag tote
Dr970XU05tM,153560,155739,as Coach's first designer.
Dr970XU05tM,155740,157720,You can still find her iconic turn locks
Dr970XU05tM,157720,159340,on Coach bags today.
Dr970XU05tM,159340,161629,Inspired by the hardware that kept the top down
Dr970XU05tM,161630,163600,on Bonnie's convertible.
Dr970XU05tM,163600,165870,The late 1960s and '70s
Dr970XU05tM,165870,168530,"were a time of radical cultural rapture,"
Dr970XU05tM,168530,171670,and soon fashion followed suit.
Dr970XU05tM,171670,174040,American designers were still viewed as apprentices
Dr970XU05tM,174040,175769,"to the European masters,"
Dr970XU05tM,175770,179050,but that all changed after the battle of Versailles.
Dr970XU05tM,179050,180750,The fashion show and fundraiser
Dr970XU05tM,180750,183810,held at the Palace of Versailles in 1973.
Dr970XU05tM,183810,188810,And indeed it was a showdown by French couturiers.
Dr970XU05tM,188810,192620,"Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin, Emanuel Ungaro,"
Dr970XU05tM,192620,196000,"Dior's Marc Bohan, and Hubert de Givenchy."
Dr970XU05tM,196000,199410,"And five American ready to wear sportswear designers,"
Dr970XU05tM,199410,202810,"Oscar de la Renta, Stephen burrows, Halston,"
Dr970XU05tM,202810,204720,"Bill Blass, and Anne Klein,"
Dr970XU05tM,204720,206580,"fought a war of couture,"
Dr970XU05tM,206580,208320,duking it out to see which nation
Dr970XU05tM,208320,211600,could produce the most impactful modern fashion.
Dr970XU05tM,211600,214240,The show was a defining moment for inclusivity
Dr970XU05tM,214240,215820,in American fashion.
Dr970XU05tM,215820,217600,"With 10 black supermodels,"
Dr970XU05tM,217600,220980,shattering notions of what to wear and who can wear it.
Dr970XU05tM,220980,222610,"And they didn't just walk,"
Dr970XU05tM,222610,225240,they literally vogued down the runway.
Dr970XU05tM,225240,227410,Even Liza Minnelli was there.
Dr970XU05tM,227410,228640,Perhaps most notable
Dr970XU05tM,228640,231660,"was the debut of black American designer, Stephen Burrows,"
Dr970XU05tM,231660,233320,on the international stage.
Dr970XU05tM,233320,237560,"And of course the designs of Studio 54 frequenter, Halston."
Dr970XU05tM,237560,240750,"Famous for his pragmatic minimalist designs,"
Dr970XU05tM,240750,243160,"often made of cashmere and ultrasuede,"
Dr970XU05tM,243160,244930,chiffon and jersey.
Dr970XU05tM,244930,248459,Not to mention this pillbox hat from his first career
Dr970XU05tM,248460,249770,as a milliner.
Dr970XU05tM,249770,252880,"These designers came to Paris with one mission,"
Dr970XU05tM,252880,256040,to prove American fashion wasn't going anywhere
Dr970XU05tM,256040,257683,except the future.
Dr970XU05tM,258519,261299,"As the fashion world rolled into the 1980s,"
Dr970XU05tM,261299,264400,three American designers were on everyone's minds
Dr970XU05tM,264400,266680,and department store receipts.
Dr970XU05tM,266680,270070,Donna Karen for her Seven Easy Pieces collection
Dr970XU05tM,270070,273360,"that paid homage to McCardell, Calvin Klein,"
Dr970XU05tM,273360,276419,and his trademark minimalism and fragrance obsession.
Dr970XU05tM,276420,278480,And his gender neutral underwear.
Dr970XU05tM,278480,281200,Not to mention those iconic black and white ads.
Dr970XU05tM,281200,283140,"And of course Ralph Lauren,"
Dr970XU05tM,283140,285460,for his hyper American sensibility
Dr970XU05tM,285460,287123,and his Polo sports line.
Dr970XU05tM,288590,291347,Minimalism is the word of the 1990s.
Dr970XU05tM,291347,294250,And the Calvin Klein slip dress amongst other pieces
Dr970XU05tM,294250,295630,was the answer.
Dr970XU05tM,295630,299110,Utilitarian style such as cargo pants and hoodies
Dr970XU05tM,299110,300729,put American ready to wear brands
Dr970XU05tM,300730,304520,"like the Gap, Banana Republic and Eddie Bauer on the map."
Dr970XU05tM,304520,307500,"And the emergence of labels like FUBU and Cross Colors,"
Dr970XU05tM,307500,310230,not to mention the winking logo appropriations
Dr970XU05tM,310230,311460,of Dapper Dan
Dr970XU05tM,311460,314169,were a response to the trends and social movements
Dr970XU05tM,314170,316880,of black and BIPOC audiences.
Dr970XU05tM,316880,319460,"By the late '90s, several American designers"
Dr970XU05tM,319460,322190,have taken the reins of major American fashion houses
Dr970XU05tM,322190,325550,and turned them into globally successful luxury brands.
Dr970XU05tM,325550,327699,"Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton,"
Dr970XU05tM,327700,329470,"Tom Ford for Gucci,"
Dr970XU05tM,329470,332170,and Narcisco Rodriguez for Cerruti.
Dr970XU05tM,332170,335440,They were also shaking things up within American brands.
Dr970XU05tM,335440,338710,Marc Jacobs's Perry Ellis Punk Show in 1992
Dr970XU05tM,338710,341910,was so ahead of its time that it got Jacobs fired.
Dr970XU05tM,341910,344150,"But here was art imitating life,"
Dr970XU05tM,344150,347009,for at least the Seattle grunge scene.
Dr970XU05tM,347010,350760,"Picture Naomi Campbell, Kristen McMenamy and Nadja Auermann"
Dr970XU05tM,350760,353350,silk shirts made to look like flannel.
Dr970XU05tM,353350,355250,"Greasy hair optional,"
Dr970XU05tM,355250,358220,consumers that appeared could now dictate the trends
Dr970XU05tM,358220,360730,that designers spot lighted in their collections.
Dr970XU05tM,360730,364150,The student always becomes the teacher after all.
Dr970XU05tM,364150,367360,"That same year, Jacobs won the CFDA women's wear"
Dr970XU05tM,367360,368889,designer of the year award.
Dr970XU05tM,368890,371180,And it's no surprise why.
Dr970XU05tM,371180,374050,"The CFDA, created in 1962"
Dr970XU05tM,374050,376229,"to put American fashion on the map,"
Dr970XU05tM,376230,378830,refocused it's mission in the wake of 911's
Dr970XU05tM,378830,381770,"devastating impact on small businesses,"
Dr970XU05tM,381770,384030,fostering new design talent.
Dr970XU05tM,384030,387270,"Thus, the CFDA Vogue Fashion Fund was born."
Dr970XU05tM,387270,390150,"Giving rise to designers such as Proenza Schouler,"
Dr970XU05tM,390150,394169,"Rodarte, Thorn Browne and Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss,"
Dr970XU05tM,394170,396010,to name a few.
Dr970XU05tM,396010,397870,There is perhaps no greater example
Dr970XU05tM,397870,402040,"of an American designer's fast past Paris than Virgil Abloh,"
Dr970XU05tM,402040,405970,who debuted his Louis Vuitton menswear line in 2018.
Dr970XU05tM,405970,409370,"From ironic, Hypebeast favorite brand or flight"
Dr970XU05tM,409370,411949,to major Parisian fashion house.
Dr970XU05tM,411950,413830,"Abloh gave credence to the phrase,"
Dr970XU05tM,413830,416599,out with the old and in with the new.
Dr970XU05tM,416600,419830,"That new of course, was American street wear."
Dr970XU05tM,419830,422240,So influential that you're just as likely
Dr970XU05tM,422240,424979,to see a professional athlete wearing Air Jordans
Dr970XU05tM,424980,427020,"and a Champion sweatshirt to practice,"
Dr970XU05tM,427020,430750,as you are an influencer grabbing coffee on Rodeo Drive.
Dr970XU05tM,430750,433200,But where does that leave us today?
Dr970XU05tM,433200,435000,The last decade of American fashion
Dr970XU05tM,435000,438070,is one of unexpected risks and upheaval.
Dr970XU05tM,438070,439590,"Just look at American designer,"
Dr970XU05tM,439590,443160,Kerby Jean-Raymond's first couture show for Pyer Moss.
Dr970XU05tM,443160,446020,Every look in his summer 2021 show
Dr970XU05tM,446020,448560,correlated to a universally known invention
Dr970XU05tM,448560,451220,attributed to a black creator.
Dr970XU05tM,451220,453860,Brands like Gypsy Sport and Telfar too
Dr970XU05tM,453860,456770,"owned by Liberian American designer, Telfar Clemens,"
Dr970XU05tM,456770,458910,have kept high fashion on its toes
Dr970XU05tM,458910,460950,and in its highest heels.
Dr970XU05tM,460950,465540,Community along with racial gender and economic inclusivity
Dr970XU05tM,465540,467850,are at the forefront of their businesses.
Dr970XU05tM,467850,471770,"Oprah, Issa Rae and AOC have all been caught slinging,"
Dr970XU05tM,471770,473759,a Telfar tote around town.
Dr970XU05tM,473760,476430,Perhaps the first vegan hip back.
Dr970XU05tM,476430,479289,Now American designers are making their own rules
Dr970XU05tM,479290,482600,and in turn influencing global fashion.
Dr970XU05tM,482600,485030,"Their innovation has proved once and for all,"
Dr970XU05tM,485030,487150,that elegance need not be sacrificed
Dr970XU05tM,487150,490530,"in the name of comfort, simplicity, and of course,"
Dr970XU05tM,490530,492800,a high standard for values.
Dr970XU05tM,492800,496479,And this blazing trail forward is just the beginning.
Dr970XU05tM,496480,499170,"For now, we can thank the American designers,"
Dr970XU05tM,499170,502940,models and organizations who wanted more from global fashion
Dr970XU05tM,502940,504880,than just the status quo.
Dr970XU05tM,504880,507570,The sheer unpredictability of where they'll go next
Dr970XU05tM,507570,509403,might be the whole point.
