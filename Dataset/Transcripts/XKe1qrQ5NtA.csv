XKe1qrQ5NtA,80,1920,this is a fascinating story we have for
XKe1qrQ5NtA,1920,4960,you of a senior google engineer who says
XKe1qrQ5NtA,4960,6799,one of the company's artificial
XKe1qrQ5NtA,6799,8800,intelligence systems has become a
XKe1qrQ5NtA,8800,10960,sentient being and was thinking and
XKe1qrQ5NtA,10960,13120,reasoning like a human being a
XKe1qrQ5NtA,13120,15040,spokesperson for google said that while
XKe1qrQ5NtA,15040,17680,chat bots can imitate conversation they
XKe1qrQ5NtA,17680,19680,are not free thinking but what made the
XKe1qrQ5NtA,19680,22160,company's former employees speak out
XKe1qrQ5NtA,22160,24000,well let's bring you some insights into
XKe1qrQ5NtA,24000,26560,that i'm joined by our technology editor
XKe1qrQ5NtA,26560,29199,zoe kleinman who is with us here today
XKe1qrQ5NtA,29199,32398,zoe what is about it's a fascinating
XKe1qrQ5NtA,32398,34640,story isn't it so google created an
XKe1qrQ5NtA,34640,36480,artificial intelligence project which it
XKe1qrQ5NtA,36480,38239,called lambda and it was designed to
XKe1qrQ5NtA,38239,40079,generate chat bots chatbots are the
XKe1qrQ5NtA,40079,41440,things you see when you go online you
XKe1qrQ5NtA,41440,43600,know a little box pops up can i help you
XKe1qrQ5NtA,43600,45440,can i you know book your flight can i
XKe1qrQ5NtA,45440,47360,can i advise you that sort of thing
XKe1qrQ5NtA,47360,49440,google wanted to make them as realistic
XKe1qrQ5NtA,49440,51680,as possible it's spent about five years
XKe1qrQ5NtA,51680,53840,now creating this
XKe1qrQ5NtA,53840,56879,the senior engineer says he had a chat
XKe1qrQ5NtA,56879,58719,with it a conversation he kind of
XKe1qrQ5NtA,58719,60320,interviewed it he's published a really
XKe1qrQ5NtA,60320,62000,long blog but it's a very interesting
XKe1qrQ5NtA,62000,63520,read in which he asked it a series of
XKe1qrQ5NtA,63520,65760,questions and the responses that it gave
XKe1qrQ5NtA,65760,68080,were fascinating on a range of subjects
XKe1qrQ5NtA,68080,69360,and he asked it things like do you like
XKe1qrQ5NtA,69360,71360,the story of les miserables and this
XKe1qrQ5NtA,71360,73439,chatbot talked about feeling story for
XKe1qrQ5NtA,73439,75200,one of the characters it talks about
XKe1qrQ5NtA,75200,76880,being afraid of death being afraid of
XKe1qrQ5NtA,76880,78720,being switched off it talks about
XKe1qrQ5NtA,78720,80960,understanding feelings of happiness and
XKe1qrQ5NtA,80960,82080,sadness
XKe1qrQ5NtA,82080,84159,and it's just not what you would expect
XKe1qrQ5NtA,84159,85920,is it from you know from from something
XKe1qrQ5NtA,85920,88240,that is that has been created to to to
XKe1qrQ5NtA,88240,89600,generate speech i mean one of the
XKe1qrQ5NtA,89600,91520,responses i've never said this out loud
XKe1qrQ5NtA,91520,93040,before but there's a very deep fear of
XKe1qrQ5NtA,93040,94960,being turned off to help me focus on
XKe1qrQ5NtA,94960,96479,helping others i know that might sound
XKe1qrQ5NtA,96479,97680,strange but that's what it is it would
XKe1qrQ5NtA,97680,99759,be exactly like death for me
XKe1qrQ5NtA,99759,101759,it would scare me a lot i mean are we
XKe1qrQ5NtA,101759,103840,talking about a sentient being so you
XKe1qrQ5NtA,103840,105759,and i are humans and this is tugging at
XKe1qrQ5NtA,105759,107360,our heartstrings isn't it you know what
XKe1qrQ5NtA,107360,109520,what what an emotional thing to say and
XKe1qrQ5NtA,109520,111759,the engineer blake lewan says it was
XKe1qrQ5NtA,111759,113520,like talking to an eight-year-old child
XKe1qrQ5NtA,113520,116640,in terms of its ability to communicate i
XKe1qrQ5NtA,116640,118079,have to throw a bit of skepticism on it
XKe1qrQ5NtA,118079,120159,here you know bear in mind this is a
XKe1qrQ5NtA,120159,122560,chatbot generator this is exactly what
XKe1qrQ5NtA,122560,125360,it was trained to do google says in in a
XKe1qrQ5NtA,125360,127360,blog post about it that if you think
XKe1qrQ5NtA,127360,129360,about how we communicate with each other
XKe1qrQ5NtA,129360,131200,you know we elaborate on subjects if i
XKe1qrQ5NtA,131200,132959,say to you i had chips last tuesday you
XKe1qrQ5NtA,132959,134800,don't say that's nice you say oh i had
XKe1qrQ5NtA,134800,136640,chips on thursday you know you are we
XKe1qrQ5NtA,136640,137760,are sort of
XKe1qrQ5NtA,137760,139440,programmed if you like to communicate in
XKe1qrQ5NtA,139440,140800,that way and that's exactly what this
XKe1qrQ5NtA,140800,142640,chatbot is doing google says it's run
XKe1qrQ5NtA,142640,144720,loads of tests and it cannot find any
XKe1qrQ5NtA,144720,147840,signs of it being sentient and google is
XKe1qrQ5NtA,147840,149680,accusing this engineer of sharing
XKe1qrQ5NtA,149680,152080,proprietary property now what what is
XKe1qrQ5NtA,152080,152959,that what
XKe1qrQ5NtA,152959,154480,what happens there
XKe1qrQ5NtA,154480,156560,well so this this belongs to google this
XKe1qrQ5NtA,156560,158640,is a project that google has created and
XKe1qrQ5NtA,158640,161920,it argues that in sharing his work he is
XKe1qrQ5NtA,161920,164239,leaking company information essentially
XKe1qrQ5NtA,164239,166319,now he says i'm not leaking company
XKe1qrQ5NtA,166319,168560,information i was having a conversation
XKe1qrQ5NtA,168560,170319,with a member of staff because one of
XKe1qrQ5NtA,170319,171840,the questions he asked is what how would
XKe1qrQ5NtA,171840,173680,you like us to treat you and this
XKe1qrQ5NtA,173680,175519,chatbot replies like an employee of
XKe1qrQ5NtA,175519,176480,google
XKe1qrQ5NtA,176480,181400,so interesting zoe thank you so much
