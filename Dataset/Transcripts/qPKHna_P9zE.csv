qPKHna_P9zE,58800,61590,They have two little knife like blades
qPKHna_P9zE,61590,64290,that cut into the flesh and then something

qPKHna_P9zE,72180,74130,and that's just the beginning.
qPKHna_P9zE,74130,78630,The saliva of ticks includes an anticoagulant
qPKHna_P9zE,78630,81060,that prevents your blood from clotting.
qPKHna_P9zE,81060,85350,It includes something to make your blood vessels expand
qPKHna_P9zE,85350,87479,so that more blood comes to the wound.

qPKHna_P9zE,94650,99060,through their bite and their saliva to overcome our defenses
qPKHna_P9zE,99060,101490,is one of the reasons that so many diseases

qPKHna_P9zE,125550,128100,The answer is that most female mammals

qPKHna_P9zE,130289,133290,"Menstruation, as we know it in homo-sapiens,"
qPKHna_P9zE,133290,135659,is actually very rare in mammals.
qPKHna_P9zE,135660,139200,Known just from our species and mostly a few other primates.
qPKHna_P9zE,139200,141810,"And they have a cycle that is called estrus,"
qPKHna_P9zE,141810,145800,"which can occur every few days in something like a mouse,"
qPKHna_P9zE,145800,150090,or only a few times a year in many of the larger mammals.

qPKHna_P9zE,159240,161130,"Or is that some cartoon shit?"""
qPKHna_P9zE,161130,164250,The answer is it really does hurt the slugs.
qPKHna_P9zE,164250,166770,If you've ever left a salt shaker out
qPKHna_P9zE,166770,168450,"in a humid environment,"
qPKHna_P9zE,168450,171840,you might have noticed that the salt tends to cake up.
qPKHna_P9zE,171840,175050,That's because salt is very good at absorbing moisture.
qPKHna_P9zE,175050,179610,And a slug is more or less like a bag of moisture.
qPKHna_P9zE,179610,184380,"So when you salt a slug, the salt dehydrates the slug,"
qPKHna_P9zE,184380,186690,"it draws the water out of the skin,"

qPKHna_P9zE,194670,197730,So murder hornets have been in the headlines lately
qPKHna_P9zE,197730,201209,because they are recently arrived in North America.
qPKHna_P9zE,201210,204450,"They are an Asian species, the Asian giant hornet."
qPKHna_P9zE,204450,207959,"And it's believed that they jumped over the Pacific Ocean,"
qPKHna_P9zE,207960,209490,"not on their own wings,"
qPKHna_P9zE,209490,213030,but in shipping containers arriving probably
qPKHna_P9zE,213030,216000,"in the port of Vancouver, in British Columbia."
qPKHna_P9zE,216000,218567,And over the border into the state of Washington.
qPKHna_P9zE,218567,222300,"Well, I happen to have murder hornets right here"
qPKHna_P9zE,222300,225150,in all three phases of their life cycle.
qPKHna_P9zE,225150,227430,"The larvae, the pupae, and the adult."
qPKHna_P9zE,227430,230549,And we focus most of our attention on the adult
qPKHna_P9zE,230550,233970,"because they're large and scary and have a potent sting,"
qPKHna_P9zE,233970,235410,but in a lot of ways
qPKHna_P9zE,235410,238170,the trouble starts right here with the larvae.
qPKHna_P9zE,238170,240810,"Because if you can imagine a nest,"
qPKHna_P9zE,240810,243450,"a colony of murder hornets with hundreds,"
qPKHna_P9zE,243450,246540,or even thousands of these giant grubs
qPKHna_P9zE,246540,248370,"that are hungry all the time,"
qPKHna_P9zE,248370,250799,it's quite a job for the adults.
qPKHna_P9zE,250800,254040,And they have developed then a particular strategy
qPKHna_P9zE,254040,255150,that sets them apart.
qPKHna_P9zE,255150,257699,They target other social insects
qPKHna_P9zE,257700,259590,"like honeybees or paper wasps,"
qPKHna_P9zE,259590,263400,"where if they can succeed in overcoming the colony,"
qPKHna_P9zE,263400,266699,they can find a huge amount of food in one place
qPKHna_P9zE,266700,269820,to take back to feed to the kids back home.
qPKHna_P9zE,269820,272520,And that strategy has led them to evolve
qPKHna_P9zE,272520,277520,this large body size with extremely thick exoskeletons
qPKHna_P9zE,278040,281340,that can withstand the stingers of the insects
qPKHna_P9zE,281340,282330,that they're attacking.
qPKHna_P9zE,282330,285840,"So, it really is the responsibility of the adults"
qPKHna_P9zE,285840,289410,to feed the young that has driven their evolution
qPKHna_P9zE,289410,292728,to be so large and scary in the first place.

qPKHna_P9zE,309870,312240,we look in extreme places.
qPKHna_P9zE,312240,315811,My favorite of these weird environments and odd creatures
qPKHna_P9zE,315812,319380,has to do with the carcasses of whales.
qPKHna_P9zE,319380,320970,"What we call whale falls,"
qPKHna_P9zE,320970,323340,when they sink to the bottom of the ocean
qPKHna_P9zE,323340,325680,and create their own little ecosystem.
qPKHna_P9zE,325680,328289,And there are zombie worms that have evolved
qPKHna_P9zE,328290,331620,"specifically to devour the bones of whales,"
qPKHna_P9zE,331620,333481,but they do so without mouths.
qPKHna_P9zE,333481,338340,They excrete an acid that dissolves the bones of the whales
qPKHna_P9zE,338340,340440,and they live alongside bacteria
qPKHna_P9zE,340440,344580,that help transfer the nutrition from those dissolved bones
qPKHna_P9zE,344580,347250,inside the worm itself.
qPKHna_P9zE,347250,351170,"So, in biology, if you want to find strange creatures,"

qPKHna_P9zE,358290,361080,"So a coral is an animal, a tiny animal,"
qPKHna_P9zE,361080,363930,with a mouth and with little tentacles

qPKHna_P9zE,369660,371580,"But where a barnacle lives alone,"
qPKHna_P9zE,371580,373987,corals live in colonies of thousands
qPKHna_P9zE,373988,376140,of clone-like individuals.
qPKHna_P9zE,376140,378030,And they take on elaborate shapes
qPKHna_P9zE,378030,380734,to get themselves up off the ocean floor
qPKHna_P9zE,380734,382620,"into the water column to feed,"
qPKHna_P9zE,382620,387210,"but also, to allow the dinoflagellates or algae"
qPKHna_P9zE,387210,389940,that live alongside them to photosynthesize
qPKHna_P9zE,389940,393030,because the little coral polyps get some nutrition
qPKHna_P9zE,393030,397080,from the photosynthesis going on in their symbiotic algae.
qPKHna_P9zE,397080,399599,And that's why many corals take on shapes
qPKHna_P9zE,399600,400740,that resemble plants.
qPKHna_P9zE,400740,404061,They're trying to increase the surface area
qPKHna_P9zE,404062,406896,of their structures so that more photosynthesis
qPKHna_P9zE,406896,408300,can take place.

qPKHna_P9zE,411660,415920,to corals and other shell-making creatures in everyday life.
qPKHna_P9zE,415920,418889,"That's because when their shells break down in the ocean,"
qPKHna_P9zE,418889,422310,particularly in shallow tropical seas
qPKHna_P9zE,422310,425340,"where corals and shell-makers are very, very common,"
qPKHna_P9zE,425340,428348,those sediments harden into limestone.
qPKHna_P9zE,428348,433348,Which we then later mine to produce cement.
qPKHna_P9zE,433620,438620,And you can track the course of the shell into the cement
qPKHna_P9zE,438750,441360,"by looking for something called calcium carbonate,"
qPKHna_P9zE,441360,443639,which is the main component of shells
qPKHna_P9zE,443640,445770,and is found in cement as well.
qPKHna_P9zE,445770,450270,"And you can do so with the addition of hydrochloric acid,"
qPKHna_P9zE,450270,453389,which dissolves that calcium carbonate
qPKHna_P9zE,453390,457560,producing bubbles of carbon dioxide alongside water.
qPKHna_P9zE,457560,460230,You can see it in the shell
qPKHna_P9zE,460230,463140,and you can see it in the cement.
qPKHna_P9zE,463140,465840,"Which means of course, that surprisingly enough,"

qPKHna_P9zE,673410,676259,and allowing the mother to raise that bird to maturity.
qPKHna_P9zE,676260,678000,Now that's not to say we should all go out
qPKHna_P9zE,678000,679980,"and start touching baby birds,"
qPKHna_P9zE,679980,682329,but it does point out that most birds
qPKHna_P9zE,682329,687329,have a very high loyalty to their eggs and to their chicks
qPKHna_P9zE,688140,689160,while they're raising them.
qPKHna_P9zE,689160,691529,And even if those nests are disturbed

qPKHna_P9zE,707700,710670,"The answer is yes, there are all sorts of species"
qPKHna_P9zE,710670,713639,that attack members of their own species in nature.
qPKHna_P9zE,713640,715530,Consider the praying mantis
qPKHna_P9zE,715530,719010,where the female will happily decapitate the male
qPKHna_P9zE,719010,721410,after population and eat the male
qPKHna_P9zE,721410,724350,to provide a free meal and more energy
qPKHna_P9zE,724350,727199,for raising up her brood of eggs.
qPKHna_P9zE,727200,730050,Or consider lingcods and various fishes
qPKHna_P9zE,730050,733080,that are perfectly happy to eat smaller individuals
qPKHna_P9zE,733080,734550,of their own species.
qPKHna_P9zE,734550,736469,"They choose their meals by size,"
qPKHna_P9zE,736469,739110,not by whether or not they're related.
qPKHna_P9zE,739110,741242,But if we want to look for examples
qPKHna_P9zE,741242,744960,"of planned attacks in nature,"
qPKHna_P9zE,744960,747557,"it helps to look at one of our closest relatives,"
qPKHna_P9zE,747557,751590,the chimpanzees who are known to organize raids
qPKHna_P9zE,751590,754110,from one neighboring band to another neighboring band
qPKHna_P9zE,754110,758279,with the express purpose of finding isolated individuals
qPKHna_P9zE,758280,760230,and attacking them and even killing them.
qPKHna_P9zE,760230,762060,"That is a grizzly behavior,"
qPKHna_P9zE,762060,765134,but one that we can look upon with some familiarity
qPKHna_P9zE,765134,767889,because we see it in our own species.

qPKHna_P9zE,784200,789200,to bring back certain species that have DNA preserved

qPKHna_P9zE,814800,819800,"go extinct in the wild, but then can be reintroduced later"
qPKHna_P9zE,819810,823440,after some sort of captive breeding project.
qPKHna_P9zE,823440,827130,"One of the most exciting to entomologists, at least,"
qPKHna_P9zE,827130,830040,examples of this has to do with a creature
qPKHna_P9zE,830040,831923,called the tree lobster.
qPKHna_P9zE,831923,836610,A giant stick insect found on Lord Howe Island
qPKHna_P9zE,836610,840480,in the Tasman Sea and considered extinct for over a century
qPKHna_P9zE,840480,842970,until a few dozen individuals were found
qPKHna_P9zE,842970,846360,eeking out a tiny existence on a rocky spire
qPKHna_P9zE,846360,847980,just off the coast.
qPKHna_P9zE,847980,850649,"They were gathered, they were bred in captivity,"
qPKHna_P9zE,850650,852810,and they now number in the thousands.
qPKHna_P9zE,852810,855120,And biologists are just waiting for the day
qPKHna_P9zE,855120,858570,they can reintroduce them to Lord Howe Island
qPKHna_P9zE,858570,861690,after they eradicate the rats

qPKHna_P9zE,876780,880500,may appear sexy or may appear booming to you right now
qPKHna_P9zE,880500,883080,because it's more important than ever before.
qPKHna_P9zE,883080,888080,"As wild areas and natural areas and biodiversity diminish,"
qPKHna_P9zE,888990,891270,the role of conserving what's left
qPKHna_P9zE,891270,893130,becomes more and more important.
qPKHna_P9zE,893130,896640,And we do have some success stories to look to
qPKHna_P9zE,896640,898980,and to inspire us as well.
qPKHna_P9zE,898980,901920,"Consider, for example, the California condor."

qPKHna_P9zE,911340,913650,and are now slowly being released

qPKHna_P9zE,915600,918029,"Flying over Northern California,"
qPKHna_P9zE,918030,920820,places where there huge wingspans
qPKHna_P9zE,920820,922860,have been missing for decades.
qPKHna_P9zE,922860,925529,So those are all the questions we have for today.
