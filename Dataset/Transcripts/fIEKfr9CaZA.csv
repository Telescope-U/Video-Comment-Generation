fIEKfr9CaZA,8000,13200,the major advantage i think to  to to making a case very strongly that
fIEKfr9CaZA,13200,19520,one of the fundamental realities of life  is it suffering is that it's actually a  relief to people to hear that
fIEKfr9CaZA,19520,25680,because they suspect it well they know  it but no one's forthright about it's  like yeah life is suffering okay fine so
fIEKfr9CaZA,25680,32000,where does that leave us well here's  where it leaves us it turns out that  even though life is suffering if you're
fIEKfr9CaZA,32000,37840,sufficiently  courageous and forthright and honest  let's say in your approach
fIEKfr9CaZA,37840,43440,and you don't shy away what you'll find  is that there's something within you  that will respond to the challenge of
fIEKfr9CaZA,43440,51280,suffering  with the development of ability that  will transcend the suffering  so the pessimism is yeah well life is
fIEKfr9CaZA,51280,57199,rife with problems  at every level but the upside is  if you turn and confront that
fIEKfr9CaZA,57199,62480,voluntarily that you'll find something  in yourself that can develop and master
fIEKfr9CaZA,62480,69040,that  and so the the optimism is nested in the  pessimism  and that's extremely helpful to people
fIEKfr9CaZA,69040,74640,especially people who are struggling  because they think oh my god life is so  difficult i don't know if i can stand  this there must be something wrong with
fIEKfr9CaZA,74640,80880,me does anybody else feel this way and  you can say yes  everyone feels that way at some time but
fIEKfr9CaZA,80880,87439,that's  and and it is as bad as you think but  you're more than you think you are  you're more than you think you are and
fIEKfr9CaZA,87439,93920,what i really like about this too is  it's very much in keeping  with the clinical data so for example
fIEKfr9CaZA,93920,101200,what you do as a clinician as a clinical  psychologist as a psychiatrist  as any mel mental health professional
fIEKfr9CaZA,101200,107759,who's well trained is  if if people are afraid of something  afraid of something that's standing in  their way as an obstacle like maybe
fIEKfr9CaZA,107759,113520,you're trying to develop your career and  you're afraid of public speaking  well i could try to calm you down about
fIEKfr9CaZA,113520,120560,your fear and  and protect you from the challenge that  would be associated with public speaking  you say well you never have to do that
fIEKfr9CaZA,120560,125920,or i could say no no look you have to  learn to present yourself more  effectively in public if you're going to
fIEKfr9CaZA,125920,133520,develop your career  and you're afraid of it so let's break  down what you're afraid of in  into 10 steps or 20 steps until we can
fIEKfr9CaZA,133520,138640,find a step that's small enough so that  you can actually master it let's assume  that with three years of diligent  practice
fIEKfr9CaZA,138640,143920,that you could become a competent public  speaker at least one that isn't  terrified  with five years you could become an
fIEKfr9CaZA,143920,149360,expert and let's decide  how relevant that is to your future  prosperity and thriving
fIEKfr9CaZA,149360,155440,and then let's assume that if you break  it down properly and take it on step by  step in this incremental way that we
fIEKfr9CaZA,155440,162480,discussed  that you'll actually master every single  bit of it and the thing that's cool  about that is  all the clinical evidence shows it works
fIEKfr9CaZA,162480,168800,and not only that that's actually how  you  learn in life like when you're when  you're when you bring a child to the
fIEKfr9CaZA,168800,175280,playground and the child is apprehensive  about  making new friends you say okay well  look kiddo
fIEKfr9CaZA,175280,182319,stick around me for a minute or two and  just watch what's going on it's like  and the child will calm down and say  okay now go five feet away
fIEKfr9CaZA,182319,188480,just go out there a little bit and just  see how it goes and stay out there as  long as you can and if you need to come  back for a hug then no problem
fIEKfr9CaZA,188480,194720,it's like so then the child can go out  ten feet they come back and say okay  well now  you know maybe just go over there and
fIEKfr9CaZA,194720,201040,and watch those kids  and the child will go out and then come  back and so that's it it's their  the child's going out to where they're
fIEKfr9CaZA,201040,206159,afraid seeing that they can master it  and then coming back
fIEKfr9CaZA,208159,215360,it's exactly why i think that what i'm  talking about is falling on receptive  ears is because  you actually cannot have a prolonged
fIEKfr9CaZA,215360,222720,discussion of rights  without having an equally prolonged  discussion of responsibilities  for a variety of reasons first of all
fIEKfr9CaZA,222720,228720,the actual reason that you have rights  is so that you can discharge your  responsibilities it's not the other way
fIEKfr9CaZA,228720,235920,around  it's like you're granted rights by  everyone around you or or  no it's not granted exactly it's
fIEKfr9CaZA,235920,242879,part of the part of the the purpose of  your rights in some sense  is so that you can be given an
fIEKfr9CaZA,242879,250640,autonomous space  that's protected in which you can  manifest  what's necessary about you in the world
fIEKfr9CaZA,250640,256000,that's  a contribution to it so i have to leave  a space for you so that you can make
fIEKfr9CaZA,256000,261440,your contribution for yourself so you  can take care of yourself so that you  can  shoulder responsibility for your family
fIEKfr9CaZA,261440,267120,and so that you can  serve the community the best way that  you can and i don't i don't want to set  up a society
fIEKfr9CaZA,267120,272320,that will interfere with that but then  and then there's the association that we
fIEKfr9CaZA,272320,277759,already talked about between risk  responsibility and meaning which is  absolutely crucial and so
fIEKfr9CaZA,277759,282960,it's the responsibility element is more  important than the right settlements as  far as i'm concerned it certainly is at
fIEKfr9CaZA,282960,290880,this point in time  so people know this they instinctively  know it  and yet the the role of the victim
fIEKfr9CaZA,290880,296080,seems which is a painful role to have  because something bad happened to you to  be a victim
fIEKfr9CaZA,296080,303919,but it's something that society  struggles with  so what about people who feel like  they're a victim they're right
fIEKfr9CaZA,304080,310560,they're victimizers too like everybody  is a strange mixture of victim and  victimizer lots of terrible things
fIEKfr9CaZA,310560,318479,happen to people that  aren't justifiable in some sense  you know well illness strikes people
fIEKfr9CaZA,318479,324560,randomly i mean not entirely randomly  obviously but there's a very there's a  large random element in it
fIEKfr9CaZA,324560,331280,where you're thrown into existence as a  consequence of your birth  that's existentialist especially the
fIEKfr9CaZA,331280,338639,1950s talked about all that all the time  they talked about it as  throneness that you're sort of thrown  into reality with your particular set of
fIEKfr9CaZA,338639,345919,predispositions and weaknesses and and  then there's going to be times in your  life where  things twist in a manner that's unfair
fIEKfr9CaZA,345919,352720,to you that you're not getting your just  desserts  but that goes along with all sorts of
fIEKfr9CaZA,352720,358319,unequally distributed privileges as well  and so that's the arbitrary nature of  existence
fIEKfr9CaZA,358319,365680,and but but you can't allow those sorts  of things to define you because it's not  it's not that useful strategically
fIEKfr9CaZA,365680,370720,you're when you're playing a card game  you're dealt you're dealt a hand of  cards
fIEKfr9CaZA,370720,377360,well what do you do you play that  hand the best you can why
fIEKfr9CaZA,377360,382639,because all the all the hands are equal  no because you don't have a better
fIEKfr9CaZA,382639,387840,strategy than playing the hand that  you're dealt the best you can  and that doesn't even mean it'll be a
fIEKfr9CaZA,387840,393039,winning strategy but  because people don't always win  sometimes we lose and sometimes we lose
fIEKfr9CaZA,393039,399039,painfully and sometimes  we lose painfully and unjustly that's  not the point  the point is you don't have a better
fIEKfr9CaZA,399039,405199,strategy and neither does anyone else  and then it's also not so obvious how
fIEKfr9CaZA,405199,412960,privilege and victimization are  distributed you know if you take someone  who's  doing quite well in life and you scratch
fIEKfr9CaZA,412960,419840,underneath the surface you generally  don't have to scratch very far until you  find  one or more profound tragedies of the
fIEKfr9CaZA,419840,427199,past or perhaps of the present you know  no matter how well protected you are in  the world you're still subject to
fIEKfr9CaZA,427199,435440,illness you're still subject to aging  you're still subject to the dissolution  of your relationships  the death of your dreams death itself
fIEKfr9CaZA,435440,440720,so vulnerability is built into the  structure of existence now if you start
fIEKfr9CaZA,440720,446479,to regard yourself as a hapless victim  or even worse an  unfairly victimized victim well then
fIEKfr9CaZA,446479,451919,things go very badly sideways for you  it's not a good strategy  you end up resentful you end up angry
fIEKfr9CaZA,451919,457120,you end up vengeful  you end up hostile and and that's just  the beginning things can get
fIEKfr9CaZA,457120,463520,far more out of hand than that so  strategically it's a bad  game it's better to take responsibility
fIEKfr9CaZA,463520,469680,for the hand that you've been dealt  [Music]
fIEKfr9CaZA,469680,475599,those who have swords and know how to  use them but  choose to keep them sheathed will
fIEKfr9CaZA,475599,481120,inherit the earth  and that's a very that's a much better  idea as far as i'm concerned because it
fIEKfr9CaZA,481120,487919,means that you have a moral obligation  to be  strong and dangerous both of those
fIEKfr9CaZA,487919,493360,but to harness that and to use it in the  service of good
fIEKfr9CaZA,493360,499120,so it's it's it's associated with a  complex set of ideas  [Music]
fIEKfr9CaZA,499120,505360,but that but that principle right there  is a is a stark  differentiator review from much of the
fIEKfr9CaZA,505360,510879,material that i read  generally it's truly about compassion  you use the word victimhood but a lot of  folks
fIEKfr9CaZA,510879,518080,do feel as a virtue to feel story for  others because usually behind that is  not that easy no that's the problem is
fIEKfr9CaZA,518080,524080,that  we wouldn't have to think if empathy  guided us properly  but it doesn't it guides us properly in
fIEKfr9CaZA,524080,529519,some very specific conditions  can also make us very dangerous because  and there's good there's good
fIEKfr9CaZA,529519,535680,experimental literature on this if  you're very  sensitive to and in groups claims
fIEKfr9CaZA,535680,540800,whatever they might be  that makes you very hostile to perceived  out group members
fIEKfr9CaZA,540800,547680,in groups people within your tribe well  within whatever group it is that you're  identifying with at that moment
fIEKfr9CaZA,547680,553279,you know so empathy drives that in-group  identification it's like okay well what  about the out group oh those are  predatory
fIEKfr9CaZA,553279,558480,those are predators we'd better be hard  on them  you know it's it's a mother bears
fIEKfr9CaZA,558480,564480,compassion that gets you eaten  so we can't be thinking that empathy is
fIEKfr9CaZA,564480,569519,an untrammeled virtue there's no there's  no evidence for that whatsoever the  psychoanalysts knew this perfectly well
fIEKfr9CaZA,569519,576080,as well  when we were still wise enough to to  attend to their more  profound realizations and that's the
fIEKfr9CaZA,576080,582320,motif of the devouring parent the  devouring mother is the  is a more general trope and that's  someone who will do
fIEKfr9CaZA,582320,587760,absolutely everything for you all the  time so that you never have to rely on  yourself for anything
fIEKfr9CaZA,587760,595040,that's not good no there's rules for  example  if you're dealing with the elderly in an  old folks home here's a rule
fIEKfr9CaZA,595040,601920,never do anything for one of your  clients they can do themselves  why because they're already struggling
fIEKfr9CaZA,601920,607760,with the loss of their independence  and you want to help them maintain that  independence as long as possible
fIEKfr9CaZA,607760,613839,and that might mean sitting by while  someone struggles to do up their buttons  for example  when you can and this is the same if
fIEKfr9CaZA,613839,620480,you're maybe helping your  three-year-old dress themselves it's  like yeah yeah you can put on the  buttons a lot faster let me help you
fIEKfr9CaZA,620480,626800,with that it's like no  you struggle with that you master it and  i'll keep my empathy to myself
fIEKfr9CaZA,626800,632310,thank you very much so that i can help  you maintain your independence
fIEKfr9CaZA,632310,635590,[Music]
fIEKfr9CaZA,638720,645519,every single person who sets out to put  themselves together ethically  is a net positive to everyone around
fIEKfr9CaZA,645519,651519,them there's no downside to that  you know my book has been criticized by  people who've read it very poorly
fIEKfr9CaZA,651519,657839,especially chapter one when i talk about  hierarchies  that i'm somehow supporting the idea
fIEKfr9CaZA,657839,663279,that  power in a hierarchy is the right way to  be and that's  there's absolutely nothing and what i've
fIEKfr9CaZA,663279,668480,written that suggests that at all like  i'm suggesting that human hierarchies  are very complex and that
fIEKfr9CaZA,668480,675600,the way that you win in a human  hierarchy is by being  competent and reciprocal and so and so i
fIEKfr9CaZA,675600,681120,mean for example  even if you're selfish let's say you got  to think very carefully about what that
fIEKfr9CaZA,681120,686160,would mean if you were selfish and awake  because  you have to work to take care of
fIEKfr9CaZA,686160,692240,yourself and what you want say in this  moment  but then there's you tomorrow and  there's you next week and there's you
fIEKfr9CaZA,692240,698320,next month the next year and 10 years  from now and when you're old  so because you're self-conscious and
fIEKfr9CaZA,698320,703760,because you're aware of the future  you're actually a community  unto yourself and if you're selfish and
fIEKfr9CaZA,703760,710399,impulsive all that means is that you're  serving  the person you are right now you know in  that impulsive way but not the person
fIEKfr9CaZA,710399,716800,you're going to be  and so that's not a good grounds for any  sort of ethical behavior  and i see that if you serve yourself
fIEKfr9CaZA,716800,723040,properly  there's no difference between that  serving your family properly and serving  your community properly those things all
fIEKfr9CaZA,723040,729680,mesh in a kind of a harmonious manner  and one of the things that's really been  effective in the lecture tour is
fIEKfr9CaZA,729680,735600,a discussion about that idea and its  relationship between  the relationship between that and
fIEKfr9CaZA,735600,741600,meaning and responsibility because  one of the things that strikes the  audience is silent
fIEKfr9CaZA,741600,746639,constantly because i'm always listening  to them to see you know when when the  attention is maximally focused is
fIEKfr9CaZA,746639,752959,whenever i point out to people that the  antidote to the meaninglessness of their  life and the suffering and
fIEKfr9CaZA,752959,759839,the malevolence that they might be  displaying because they're resentful and  bitter about how things have turned out  the antidote to that is to take on more
fIEKfr9CaZA,759839,766480,responsibility  for themselves and for other people and  that that's aspirational  which is kind of cool you know the
fIEKfr9CaZA,766480,772959,conservative types  the duty types and i'm not complaining  about them you know  they're always basically saying well
fIEKfr9CaZA,772959,778480,this is how you should act  because in some sense that's your duty  right that's how a good citizen would
fIEKfr9CaZA,778480,785200,act  and that's a reasonable argument but the  case that i've been making is more that  well there is a there is value
fIEKfr9CaZA,785200,790399,distinctions between things  some things are worth doing and some  things aren't and you can kind of
fIEKfr9CaZA,790399,795440,discover  what that is for yourself and then you  should aim at the things that are most  worth doing
fIEKfr9CaZA,795440,801519,and what you'll find if you watch  carefully is that  the things that you find worth doing are
fIEKfr9CaZA,801519,807600,almost always associated with an  increase in responsibility because if  you think about the people you admire
fIEKfr9CaZA,807600,813120,for example you spontaneously admire  people and that's a manifestation of the  instinct to imitate
fIEKfr9CaZA,813120,818800,and people are very imitative you don't  admire people who don't take care of  themselves  like unless there's something wrong with
fIEKfr9CaZA,818800,824079,you you at least want  an admirable person to be accountable  for themselves
fIEKfr9CaZA,824079,830959,and then if they've got something left  over so they can be accountable for  their family well then that's a net plus  obviously that's someone you think is
fIEKfr9CaZA,830959,838160,solid and then maybe they take care of  some more people they have a business or  they're involved in the community in  some positive way you see well that's a
fIEKfr9CaZA,838160,843360,person whose  pattern of being is worth imitating and  so and that's all associated with
fIEKfr9CaZA,843360,848399,responsibility and  it's so interesting because it's as if  it's as if
fIEKfr9CaZA,848399,854079,everybody kind of knows this but that it  hasn't crystallized it's like  well you should be responsible because
fIEKfr9CaZA,854079,859920,that's what a good citizen is it's not  no no  you should be responsible because you  need to have a deep meaning in your life
fIEKfr9CaZA,859920,866959,to offset the suffering so you don't get  bitter  and the way you do that is to bear a  heavy load you know to get yourself in
fIEKfr9CaZA,866959,872320,in check for you now and for you in the  future and then to do the same for your  family and your community and that
fIEKfr9CaZA,872320,878079,there's real nobility in that and  there's real meaning  and more the other thing that i've been  suggesting to people and i also believe
fIEKfr9CaZA,878079,883680,this is that  and i think that the guys that have come  to talk to me especially the ones that  have had real life real rough lives they
fIEKfr9CaZA,883680,891680,really understand this  if you don't get your act together and  you let yourself slide  then what kind of moves in to take the
fIEKfr9CaZA,891680,898000,place of what you could have been is  something that's really not good at all  so it's not only that if you're living a
fIEKfr9CaZA,898000,903120,like a dissolute life  that you're not aiming at anything  positive and so you don't have any real
fIEKfr9CaZA,903120,909360,meaning and you're  subsumed by anxiety and all of that  hopelessness but something kind of  hellish moves in there too to
fIEKfr9CaZA,909360,915120,to occupy that place and so then you end  up making things worse  and when you know one of the things i
fIEKfr9CaZA,915120,921360,learned about studying totalitarian  systems  whether they were on the right or the  left was that part of the reason that
fIEKfr9CaZA,921360,928720,the totalitarian horrors of the 20th  century manifested themselves was  because average people  didn't take on the proper responsibility
fIEKfr9CaZA,928720,934160,they shut their eyes when their eyes  should have been open  even though they knew it and they didn't  said things they knew they shouldn't
fIEKfr9CaZA,934160,939680,have done and said  and that was what supported those  horrible systems so  you know if you don't get your act
fIEKfr9CaZA,939680,945279,together then you leave a little space  for hell  and i really believe that
fIEKfr9CaZA,946240,952720,so i figured something out that i  thought i'd tell you about this took me  like 30 years to figure out and i  figured it out on this tour
fIEKfr9CaZA,952720,959360,so there's this old idea you know that  you have to rescue your father from the  belly of the whale right  from some monster that's deep in the
fIEKfr9CaZA,959360,964959,abyss you see that pinocchio for example  but  it's a very common idea and i figured
fIEKfr9CaZA,964959,971839,out why that is i think  so imagine that we already know from a  clinical perspective that
fIEKfr9CaZA,971839,976880,you know if you set out a path towards a  goal which  you want to do because you need a goal
fIEKfr9CaZA,976880,981920,and you need a path  because that provides you with positive  emotion right so you set up something as
fIEKfr9CaZA,981920,987360,valuable  so that implies a hierarchy you set up  something as valuable  you decide that you're going to do that
fIEKfr9CaZA,987360,993360,instead of other things so that's kind  of a sacrifice  because you're sacrificing everything  else to pursue that and then
fIEKfr9CaZA,993360,1000000,you experience a fair bit of positive  emotion and meaning as you watch  yourself move towards the goal  and so the implication of that is the
fIEKfr9CaZA,1000000,1005440,the better the goal the  the more full and rich your experience  is going to be when you pursue it so
fIEKfr9CaZA,1005440,1011680,that's one of the reasons  of that's one of the reasons for  developing a vision and for fleshing  yourself out philosophically because you
fIEKfr9CaZA,1011680,1018399,want to  aim at the highest goal that you can  manage okay so  you do that and then what you'll find is
fIEKfr9CaZA,1018399,1024160,that as you move towards the goal there  are certain things that  that that you have to accomplish that  frighten you you know
fIEKfr9CaZA,1024160,1029360,maybe you have to learn to be a better  speaker a better writer a better thinker  you have to be better to people around
fIEKfr9CaZA,1029360,1035760,you or you have to learn some new skills  and you're afraid of that  whatever because it's going to stretch  you if you if you pursue a goal and it's
fIEKfr9CaZA,1035760,1042480,and so that'll put you up against  challenges okay so all the clinical  data indicates well the opposite of safe
fIEKfr9CaZA,1042480,1049360,spaces as  jonathan height has been pointing out  that what you want to do when  you identify something that someone is
fIEKfr9CaZA,1049360,1054400,avoiding  that they need to do because they're  afraid you have them voluntary con
fIEKfr9CaZA,1054400,1059919,voluntarily confronted and so you break  it down what you try to do if you're a  behavior therapist is you break down the
fIEKfr9CaZA,1059919,1066080,thing they're avoiding into smaller and  smaller pieces  until you find a piece that's small  enough so they'll do it and it doesn't
fIEKfr9CaZA,1066080,1071120,really matter as long as they start it  you know then they can put the next  piece on in the next piece and what
fIEKfr9CaZA,1071120,1077600,happens is  they don't get less afraid exactly they  get braver  they get it's like there's more of them
fIEKfr9CaZA,1077600,1083200,you can and here's why so imagine  you do something new and that's
fIEKfr9CaZA,1083200,1089600,informative  right there's information in the action  and then you can incorporate that  information and turn it into a skill and
fIEKfr9CaZA,1089600,1096400,turn it into a transformation of your  perceptions  so there's more to you because you've  tried something new so that's one thing
fIEKfr9CaZA,1096400,1101520,but the second thing is and there's good  biological evidence for this now that
fIEKfr9CaZA,1101520,1107919,if you put yourself in a new situation  then new  genes code for new proteins and build
fIEKfr9CaZA,1107919,1114000,new neural structures and new nervous  system structures  same thing happens to some degree when  you work out right because your your
fIEKfr9CaZA,1114000,1119440,muscles are responding to the load  but your nervous system does that too so  you imagine that there's a lot of
fIEKfr9CaZA,1119440,1126080,potential you  locked in your genetic code and then if  you put yourself in a new situation then
fIEKfr9CaZA,1126080,1131200,then the stress that's the situational  stress that's produced by that  particular situation
fIEKfr9CaZA,1131200,1137760,unlocks those genes and then builds new  parts of you and so that's very cool  because  who knows how much there is locked
fIEKfr9CaZA,1137760,1144880,inside of you  okay so now here's the idea so  let's assume that that scales as you
fIEKfr9CaZA,1144880,1150080,take on heavier and heavier loads that  more and more of you  you get more and more informed because
fIEKfr9CaZA,1150080,1155200,you're doing more and more difficult  things  but more and more of you gets unlocked
fIEKfr9CaZA,1155200,1161520,and so then what that would imply is  that  if you got to the point where you could  look at the darkest things so that would
fIEKfr9CaZA,1161520,1166640,be the abyss right that would be the  deepest abyss if you could look at the  harshest things like the most
fIEKfr9CaZA,1166640,1173200,brutal parts of the suffering of the  world and the malevolence of people and  society if you could look that look at
fIEKfr9CaZA,1173200,1178240,that  straight and and directly that that  would turn you on
fIEKfr9CaZA,1178240,1185039,maximally and so that's the idea of  rescuing your father because  imagine that you're like the potential
fIEKfr9CaZA,1185039,1190840,composite of  of all your all the ancestral wisdom  that's locked inside of you
fIEKfr9CaZA,1190840,1196240,biologically but that's not going to  come out at all  unless you stress yourself unless you
fIEKfr9CaZA,1196240,1203919,unless you challenge yourself  and the bigger the challenge you take on  the more that's going to turn on  and so that as you take on a broader and
fIEKfr9CaZA,1203919,1209440,broader range of challenges  and you push yourself harder then more  and more of what you could be
fIEKfr9CaZA,1209440,1214480,turns on and that's equivalent to  transforming yourself into the ancestral  father
fIEKfr9CaZA,1214480,1220000,into all because you're you're like the  what would you call it you're the  consequence of all these
fIEKfr9CaZA,1220000,1226960,living beings that have come before you  and that's all  part of your biological potentiality and
fIEKfr9CaZA,1226960,1232640,then if you can push yourself then all  that  clicks on and that turns you into who  you could be that's and that's the
fIEKfr9CaZA,1232640,1238400,re-representation of that  positive ancestral father so that's why  you rescue your father from the belly of
fIEKfr9CaZA,1238400,1244640,the beast  the two major problems that people face
fIEKfr9CaZA,1244640,1250080,obviously are suffering  tragedy and malevolence and so that's  the other thing that you're responsible
fIEKfr9CaZA,1250080,1256240,for  is that you're supposed to look at the  capacity for human evil  as clearly as you possibly can it's a
fIEKfr9CaZA,1256240,1262799,very terrifying thing you know that  causes post-traumatic stress disorder in  people that aren't  accustomed to it and in the mythology
fIEKfr9CaZA,1262799,1268640,that's associated with the encounter  with evil  it's almost always the case that the  entity that
fIEKfr9CaZA,1268640,1275360,does the encountering even if it does it  voluntarily  is is is
fIEKfr9CaZA,1275360,1281360,hurt by it so the egyptian god horus for  example who's the eye  and the falcon the thing that can see
fIEKfr9CaZA,1281360,1286880,and pay attention when he encounters his  evil uncle seth  who's the precursor of satan he loses an
fIEKfr9CaZA,1286880,1293200,eye because it's no joke to encounter  malevolence  you know it can really shake you but the
fIEKfr9CaZA,1293200,1299440,idea would be that if you can face the  malevolence and you can face the  suffering then that maximally
fIEKfr9CaZA,1299440,1306559,that opens the door to your maximal  potential and then the option  the optimistic part of that is and then
fIEKfr9CaZA,1306559,1312640,this is  this is why it's so useful to peer into  the darkness let's say  the optimistic part of that is is that
fIEKfr9CaZA,1312640,1318799,although the suffering is great and the  malevolence is  is deep your capacity to transcend it is
fIEKfr9CaZA,1318799,1321279,stronger
fIEKfr9CaZA,1328559,1334480,another thing i've always often asked my  undergraduate classes is  you know there's this idea that that
fIEKfr9CaZA,1334480,1339840,people have that people have a  conscience  and you know what the conscience is it's
fIEKfr9CaZA,1339840,1344880,it's this  feeling or voice you have in your head  just before you do something
fIEKfr9CaZA,1344880,1351840,that you know is stupid telling you that  probably you shouldn't do that stupid  thing  you don't have to listen to it strangely
fIEKfr9CaZA,1351840,1358080,enough  but you go ahead and do it anyways and  then of course exactly what the  conscience told you was going to happen
fIEKfr9CaZA,1358080,1364799,inevitably happen so that you feel even  stupider about it than you would if it  happened by accident  because you you know i knew this was
fIEKfr9CaZA,1364799,1371120,going to happen i got a warning it was  going to happen  and i went and did it anyways and the  funny thing too is that that conscience
fIEKfr9CaZA,1371120,1377280,operates within people and we really  don't understand what the hell  that is so you might say well what would
fIEKfr9CaZA,1377280,1382880,happen if you abided by your conscience  for five years or for ten years  what sort of position might you be in
fIEKfr9CaZA,1382880,1388720,what sort of family might you have  what sort of relationship might you be  able to forge and you can be bloody sure
fIEKfr9CaZA,1388720,1393760,that a relationship that's forged  on the basis of who you actually are is
fIEKfr9CaZA,1393760,1399120,going to be a lot stronger and more  welcome than one that's forged on the  basis of who you aren't
fIEKfr9CaZA,1399120,1404880,now of course that means that the person  you're with has to deal with  the full force of you in all your
fIEKfr9CaZA,1404880,1411679,ability and your catastrophe and that's  a very very difficult thing to negotiate  but if you do negotiate it well at least
fIEKfr9CaZA,1411679,1417679,you you have something  you have somewhere solid to stand and  you have somewhere to live you have a  real life
fIEKfr9CaZA,1417679,1423520,and it's a great basis upon which to  bring children into the world for  example because you can have an actual
fIEKfr9CaZA,1423520,1431279,relationship with them instead of  torturing them half to death which is  what happens in  a tremendous a tremendously large
fIEKfr9CaZA,1431279,1437520,minority of cases  well it's more than that too because and  this is what i'll close with and this is
fIEKfr9CaZA,1437520,1444000,why i wanted to introduce social  nissan's writings to you you see  because it isn't merely that your fate
fIEKfr9CaZA,1444000,1449600,depends on whether or not you get your  act together and to what degree you  decide that you're going to live
fIEKfr9CaZA,1449600,1454720,out your own genuine being it isn't only  your fate  it's the fate of everyone that you're
fIEKfr9CaZA,1454720,1460400,networked with and so you know you think  well  there's nine billion seven billion
fIEKfr9CaZA,1460400,1465760,people in the world we're going to peak  at about nine billion by the way  and then it'll decline rapidly but seven
fIEKfr9CaZA,1465760,1471120,billion people in the world and who are  you you're just one little dust mote  among that seven billion and so it
fIEKfr9CaZA,1471120,1476480,really doesn't matter what you do or  don't do but that's  simply not the case it's the wrong model
fIEKfr9CaZA,1476480,1482400,because you're at the center  of a network you're a node in a network  of course that's even more true now that
fIEKfr9CaZA,1482400,1487600,we have social media  you'll you'll know a thousand people at  least over the course of your life
fIEKfr9CaZA,1487600,1494799,and they'll know a thousand people each  and that puts you one person away from a  million  and two persons away from a billion and
fIEKfr9CaZA,1494799,1501200,so that's how you're connected and the  things you do  they're like dropping a stone in a pond  the ripples move outward
fIEKfr9CaZA,1501200,1507360,and they affect things in ways that you  can't fully comprehend and it means that  the things that you do and that you
fIEKfr9CaZA,1507360,1511600,don't do are far more important than you
fIEKfr9CaZA,1512840,1515840,think
fIEKfr9CaZA,1518320,1524720,if you can teach people to stand up in  the face of the things they're afraid of  they get stronger and you don't know
fIEKfr9CaZA,1524720,1530559,what the upper limits to that are  because you might ask yourself like  if for 10 years if you didn't avoid
fIEKfr9CaZA,1530559,1535600,doing what you knew you needed to do  by the deaf by your own definitions  right within the value structure that
fIEKfr9CaZA,1535600,1541440,you've created  to the degree that you've done that what  would you be like
fIEKfr9CaZA,1541440,1549520,well you know there are remarkable  people who come into the world from time  to time and there are people who do  find out over decades long periods what
fIEKfr9CaZA,1549520,1555360,they could be like if they were who they  were  if they said if they spoke their being
fIEKfr9CaZA,1555360,1560559,forward  and they get stronger and stronger and  stronger and we don't know the limits to
fIEKfr9CaZA,1560559,1566240,that we do not know the limits to that  and so you could say well in part  perhaps the reason that you're suffering  unbearably
fIEKfr9CaZA,1566240,1572960,can be left at your feet because you're  not everything you could be and you know  it  and of course that's a terrible thing to
fIEKfr9CaZA,1572960,1579760,admit and it's a terrible thing to  consider  but there's real promise in it right  because it means that
fIEKfr9CaZA,1579760,1585919,perhaps there's another way that you  could look at the world and the number  another way that you could act  in the world so what it would reflect
fIEKfr9CaZA,1585919,1591679,back to you would be much better than  what it reflects back to you now  and then the second part of that is well
fIEKfr9CaZA,1591679,1597919,imagine that many people did that  because  we've done a lot as human beings we've  done a lot of remarkable things and i've
fIEKfr9CaZA,1597919,1604320,told you already  i think before that today for example  about 250  000 people will be lifted out of abject
fIEKfr9CaZA,1604320,1609760,poverty and about 300 000 people  attached to the electrical power grid  we're making people
fIEKfr9CaZA,1609760,1616960,we're lifting people out of poverty  collectively at a faster rate that's  ever occurred in the history of  humankind by a huge margin and that's
fIEKfr9CaZA,1616960,1623919,been going on  unbelievably quickly since the year 2000  the u.n had  planned to have poverty between 2000 and
fIEKfr9CaZA,1623919,1630880,2015  and it was accomplished by 2013. so  there's  inequality developing in many places and
fIEKfr9CaZA,1630880,1636240,you hear lots of political agitation  about that  but overall the the tide is lifting
fIEKfr9CaZA,1636240,1641919,everyone up and that's a great thing and  we have no idea how fast we could  multiply that  if people got their act together and
fIEKfr9CaZA,1641919,1647840,really aimed at it  because you know my my experience is  with people that we're probably running
fIEKfr9CaZA,1647840,1655760,at about 51  of our capacity something i mean you can  think about this yourselves  i often ask undergraduates how many
fIEKfr9CaZA,1655760,1662240,hours a day you waste or how many hours  a week you waste and  the classic answer is something like  four to six hours a day
fIEKfr9CaZA,1662240,1668480,you know inefficient studying watching  things on youtube that not only do you  not want to watch that you don't even
fIEKfr9CaZA,1668480,1674240,care about that make you feel horrible  about watching after you're done  that's probably four hours right there
fIEKfr9CaZA,1674240,1680399,you know you think well that's  20 25 hours a week it's 100 hours a  month that's two and a half full work
fIEKfr9CaZA,1680399,1686000,weeks  it's half a year of work weeks per year  and if your time is worth
fIEKfr9CaZA,1686000,1691039,twenty dollars an hour which is a  radical underestimate it's probably more  like 50  if you think about it in terms of
fIEKfr9CaZA,1691039,1697039,deferred wages if you're wasting  20 hours a week you're wasting fifty  thousand dollars a year
fIEKfr9CaZA,1697039,1702559,and you are doing that right now and  it's because you're young wasting fifty  thousand dollars a year is a way bigger
fIEKfr9CaZA,1702559,1708320,catastrophe than it would be for me to  waste it because i'm not gonna last  nearly as long  and so if your life isn't everything it
fIEKfr9CaZA,1708320,1713679,could be you could ask yourself well  what would happen if you just stopped  wasting the opportunities that are in
fIEKfr9CaZA,1713679,1719760,front of you  you'd be who knows how much more  efficient 10 times more efficient
fIEKfr9CaZA,1719760,1725520,20 times more efficient that's the  pareto distribution  you have no idea how efficient efficient
fIEKfr9CaZA,1725520,1730720,people get  it's completely it's off the charts
fIEKfr9CaZA,1730960,1736240,well and if we all got our act together  collectively and stop  making things worse because that's
fIEKfr9CaZA,1736240,1743039,another thing people do all the time  not only do they not do what they should  to make things better  they actively attempt to make things
fIEKfr9CaZA,1743039,1749200,worse because they're spiteful or  resentful  or arrogant or deceitful or or homicidal
fIEKfr9CaZA,1749200,1756080,or genocidal or  all of those things all bundled together  in an absolutely pathological package
fIEKfr9CaZA,1756080,1761600,if people stopped really really trying  just to make things worse  we have no idea how much better they
fIEKfr9CaZA,1761600,1766960,would get just because of that  so there's this weird dynamic that's  part of the existential
fIEKfr9CaZA,1766960,1773120,system of ideas between human  vulnerability  social judgment both of which are are
fIEKfr9CaZA,1773120,1778799,are are major causes of suffering and  the failure of individuals to adopt the  responsibility
fIEKfr9CaZA,1778799,1784460,that they know they should adopt  [Music]
fIEKfr9CaZA,1785919,1791760,and so if you act that way of course the  terror of realizing that is that it  actually  starts to matter what you do and you
fIEKfr9CaZA,1791760,1796880,might say well that's better  than living a meaningless existence it's  better for it to matter
fIEKfr9CaZA,1796880,1802799,but i mean if you really asked yourself  would you be so sure if you had the  choice  i can live with no responsibility
fIEKfr9CaZA,1802799,1808480,whatsoever the price i pay is that  nothing matters  or i can reverse it and everything
fIEKfr9CaZA,1808480,1814720,matters but i have to take the  responsibility that's associated with  that  it's not so obvious to me that people
fIEKfr9CaZA,1814720,1820159,would take the meaningful path  you know when you say well nihilists  suffer dreadfully because there's no
fIEKfr9CaZA,1820159,1826640,meaning in their life and they still  suffer yeah but the advantage is they  have no responsibility  so that's the payoff and i actually
fIEKfr9CaZA,1826640,1831679,think that's the motivation say well i  can't help being nihilistic all my  belief systems have collapsed it's like
fIEKfr9CaZA,1831679,1837200,yeah maybe maybe you've just allowed  them to collapse because it's a hell of  a lot easier than acting them out
fIEKfr9CaZA,1837200,1843360,and the price you pay is some  meaningless suffering but you can always  whine about that and people will feel  sorry for you  and you have the option of taking the
fIEKfr9CaZA,1843360,1848720,pathway of the martyr so that's a pretty  good deal all things considered  especially when they are when the
fIEKfr9CaZA,1848720,1855279,alternative is to  bear your burden properly and to live  forthrightly in the world well
fIEKfr9CaZA,1855279,1860480,what solzhenitsyn figured out and so  many people in the 20th century it's not  just him even though he's the best
fIEKfr9CaZA,1860480,1867519,example  is that if you live a pathological life  you pathologize your society and if
fIEKfr9CaZA,1867519,1872720,enough people do that then  it's hell really
fIEKfr9CaZA,1872720,1878720,really and you can read the gulag  archipelago if you  have the fortitude to do that and you'll
fIEKfr9CaZA,1878720,1885600,see exactly what hell is like  and then you can decide if that's a  place you'd like to visit  or even more importantly if it's a light
fIEKfr9CaZA,1885600,1891519,if it's a place you'd like to visit  and take all your family and friends  because that's what happened in the 20th
fIEKfr9CaZA,1891519,1893840,century
fIEKfr9CaZA,1904240,1910480,you know we don't live that long right  and and we're really complicated  and it's not easy to learn how to be a
fIEKfr9CaZA,1910480,1916640,person you know i mean it takes you like  40 years before you can learn to be a  person  enough so that you can get out of your
fIEKfr9CaZA,1916640,1923518,mother's basement  so it's hard that's half your life  before
fIEKfr9CaZA,1923600,1928799,well maybe not 40 but but certainly  sometimes  um it takes a long time to learn how to
fIEKfr9CaZA,1928799,1934880,be a human being and  and we're very very complicated we're  we're way more complicated than we can
fIEKfr9CaZA,1934880,1941200,understand  you know and we've been watching each  other for a long time watching ourselves  telling stories about ourselves
fIEKfr9CaZA,1941200,1946399,trying to draw some wisdom from our self  observations  to teach to our children and to our
fIEKfr9CaZA,1946399,1951519,grandchildren and so forth and  we've codified them in all sorts of  strange ways in these
fIEKfr9CaZA,1951519,1958320,memorable stories fairy tales and myths  and religious stories all of those  things
fIEKfr9CaZA,1958320,1964000,and what are they there for  [Music]  they're there to remind us who we are
fIEKfr9CaZA,1964000,1969919,because we need to know who we are  i i believe the most important idea
fIEKfr9CaZA,1969919,1976720,that's ever been generated  is the the idea that men and women are
fIEKfr9CaZA,1976720,1982399,made in the image of god  i think that a culture that doesn't that
fIEKfr9CaZA,1982399,1987679,isn't predicated on that belief  knowingly or unknowingly and better
fIEKfr9CaZA,1987679,1993039,knowingly is  doomed to absolute catastrophe
fIEKfr9CaZA,1993039,2000240,because there's no reason to assume that  there isn't something about us that's
fIEKfr9CaZA,2000240,2005600,of transcendent value i mean
fIEKfr9CaZA,2005600,2012080,if if for no other reason than the fact  of our consciousness you know like here  we are we're aware
fIEKfr9CaZA,2012080,2018159,of of what there is and it isn't even  obvious that there could be what there
fIEKfr9CaZA,2018159,2024000,is if there wasn't  something that's aware of it and so our  very awareness is
fIEKfr9CaZA,2024000,2030480,plays an integral role in the fact of  being itself  you know and metaphysics aside it's hard
fIEKfr9CaZA,2030480,2035679,to see that anything could be  more vital than that more important than
fIEKfr9CaZA,2035679,2041760,that and then  it isn't only that we apprehend reality  you know and and therefore give it give
fIEKfr9CaZA,2041760,2047760,it shape merely by our perceptions  it's also clearly the case that we  partake in its
fIEKfr9CaZA,2047760,2052960,shaping and and we call ourselves on  that you know you you you know you know
fIEKfr9CaZA,2052960,2058800,that you feel guilty and ashamed when  you're not doing what you could be doing  when you're not living up to your
fIEKfr9CaZA,2058800,2065440,potential when you're not  making the most of what's offered to you  you  understand at a very deep level that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2065440,2070560,you're that you're  that you're what would you you're you're  breaking
fIEKfr9CaZA,2070560,2078320,there's no other way of saying it you're  breaking a divine commandment  you're offered this unbelievably
fIEKfr9CaZA,2078320,2085200,rich possibility and it's there for you  to  grapple with and and you say well i
fIEKfr9CaZA,2085200,2090878,don't believe in such things that in the  divinity of humanity or in divinity  itself
fIEKfr9CaZA,2090878,2096000,or in the divine for that matter but you  you can't  fool yourself with that kind of
fIEKfr9CaZA,2096000,2101359,argumentation it doesn't stop you from  feeling  guilty and ashamed and worthless and
fIEKfr9CaZA,2101359,2106960,disappointed and frustrated and angry  and vengeful at the fact that you're
fIEKfr9CaZA,2106960,2113599,wasting your life  and you're noticing it and that you're  making yourself  much less than you could be and that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2113599,2121359,you're making things around you worse  for everyone else  and like perhaps
fIEKfr9CaZA,2121359,2129440,there's a psychopath or two in the  audience who just doesn't give a damn  and who is focused only on instantaneous
fIEKfr9CaZA,2129440,2136880,gratification  for their most primordial impulses  this moment right but it's not a
fIEKfr9CaZA,2136880,2145839,sustainable mode of being  and it's very rare and so
fIEKfr9CaZA,2145920,2150960,the purpose of religious ideas is to  wake us up
fIEKfr9CaZA,2151599,2158079,it's to remind us who we are right  it's to remind us that we're imbued with
fIEKfr9CaZA,2158079,2163520,with a spirit that can be best described  in some sense as a mortal
fIEKfr9CaZA,2163520,2170320,it's it's the spirit that allows all of  us to be conscious  that we all participate in  simultaneously that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2170320,2174720,gives rise to the world and shapes it
fIEKfr9CaZA,2181350,2187040,[Music]  in order to have any positive meaning in  your life you have to have identified a
fIEKfr9CaZA,2187040,2192160,goal  and you have to be working towards it  and there is a technical reason for that  and
fIEKfr9CaZA,2192160,2197680,the technical reason as far as i can  tell is that the circuitry that produces  the kind of positive emotion that people
fIEKfr9CaZA,2197680,2203040,really like  is only activated when you notice that  you're
fIEKfr9CaZA,2203040,2208720,when you're proceeding towards a goal  that you value  and so that means that if you don't have
fIEKfr9CaZA,2208720,2214720,a goal that you value you can't have any  positive emotion so  technically that's the incentive reward  system and it's
fIEKfr9CaZA,2214720,2221119,the underlying circuitry is dopaminergic  and when that circuitry is activated  then  it's part of the exploratory circuit it
fIEKfr9CaZA,2221119,2226240,makes you it gives you the sense of  being actively engaged in something  worthwhile
fIEKfr9CaZA,2226240,2232800,and that's you know you tend to think of  positive emotion as something produced  by reward  but there's two kinds of positive
fIEKfr9CaZA,2232800,2238240,emotion one is the reward that's  associated with satiation  and that's consumatory reward and that's
fIEKfr9CaZA,2238240,2245359,the reward you get when you're hungry  and you eat  but the thing about eating when you're  hungry is that it destroys the framework
fIEKfr9CaZA,2245359,2251599,within which you were operating right  it's time to eat  while you eat and then that framework's  no longer relevant so the consumatory
fIEKfr9CaZA,2251599,2256720,reward  eliminates the value framework and then  you're stuck with well what are you  going to do next
fIEKfr9CaZA,2256720,2262480,and so the consumatory reward has with  its own problems but  the incentive reward is constantly what
fIEKfr9CaZA,2262480,2270480,keeps you moving forward  and incentive reward because it's  dopaminergic also  is analgesic literally analgesic so
fIEKfr9CaZA,2270480,2276640,if you're in pain you take opiates and  that that will cut the pain but so will  psychomotor stimulants like cocaine or
fIEKfr9CaZA,2276640,2281920,amphetamines  and so it's literally the case that if  you're engaged in something
fIEKfr9CaZA,2281920,2288160,that's engaging and you're working  towards a goal that you're going to feel  less pain and you can see this happening  with athletes who you know
fIEKfr9CaZA,2288160,2294079,they'll break their thumb or something  or maybe sometimes even their ankle and  they'll keep playing the game  of course afterwards they're suffering
fIEKfr9CaZA,2294079,2300240,like mad but the fact that they're so  filled with goal directed enthusiasm  means that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2300240,2305520,well the pain systems are in some sense  shut off  so that's an interesting thing because
fIEKfr9CaZA,2305520,2310880,what it suggests  i mean then you could imagine i might  say well how happy you
fIEKfr9CaZA,2310880,2318240,are you that you've made a certain  amount of progress and  if you think about it what you'd say is  well it depends on how much progress
fIEKfr9CaZA,2318240,2323280,and in relationship to what so  hypothetically you're going to be  happier if you've made quite a bit of
fIEKfr9CaZA,2323280,2329119,progress towards a really important goal  and then you have to think through what  it means for a goal to be really
fIEKfr9CaZA,2329119,2334320,important because that's not obvious  now you could say you're in this class
fIEKfr9CaZA,2334320,2341200,and you're listening to some information  and  maybe there's two reasons for that you  might find the information interesting
fIEKfr9CaZA,2341200,2348000,per se but let's forget about that for a  minute  you need to listen to the information so  that you can do well on the assignment
fIEKfr9CaZA,2348000,2353520,so that you can do well in the class  you need to do well in your classes so  that you can finish up your degree
fIEKfr9CaZA,2353520,2359760,you need to finish up your degree so  that you can find your place in the  world  you need to do that so that you're  financially stable and maybe you can
fIEKfr9CaZA,2359760,2364800,start a family  and have a life and that's all part of  being a good person something like that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2364800,2370480,and so that's a hierarchy of goals  and you might say that being a good
fIEKfr9CaZA,2370480,2375760,person would be the thing  however vaguely thought through that's  at the top of that hierarchy
fIEKfr9CaZA,2375760,2381200,and then when you're doing things that  serve the  that ultimate purpose then you're going
fIEKfr9CaZA,2381200,2387599,to find those more meaningful and that  meaning is actually produced as a  consequence of the engagement of this  exploratory circuit
fIEKfr9CaZA,2387599,2393200,that's nested right down in your  hypothalamus it's really  really old it's as old as thirst and
fIEKfr9CaZA,2393200,2410160,it's as old as hunger it's really an old  system and so you want to have that  thing activated
fIEKfr9CaZA,2410160,2415839,you speak frequently in your lectures  about  i guess the war between good and evil or
fIEKfr9CaZA,2415839,2421440,the struggle of life really  is a struggle between good and evil  being at the core of a conscious
fIEKfr9CaZA,2421440,2427680,lived existence and  i guess on that note
fIEKfr9CaZA,2428640,2434400,if you were 100 certain  that there was no afterlife would you
fIEKfr9CaZA,2434400,2440720,still be able to preach that there's a  positive meaning  in life if you were 100 certain some
fIEKfr9CaZA,2440720,2447280,atheists  seem to be 100 certain and yet they  still preach that there's some positive  meaning to life would you be one of
fIEKfr9CaZA,2447280,2453839,those  or would you turn into cain you know so  cynical  i think that well as far as i'm
fIEKfr9CaZA,2453839,2459040,concerned  one of the things i learned from  studying 20th century history is that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2459040,2464240,like even if the idea that even if you  take the most cynical of ideas let's say  that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2464240,2472000,life is irredeemable suffering and and  perhaps isn't even justified  because of that it still seems to me
fIEKfr9CaZA,2472000,2479200,that  you have an ethical duty let's say  to live in a manner that reduces that to
fIEKfr9CaZA,2479200,2485119,the degree  that that's possible and so and i think  that that can be experienced as
fIEKfr9CaZA,2485119,2491200,meaningful  in some sense independently of the  transcendent context  now i don't exactly know how to strip
fIEKfr9CaZA,2491200,2496800,off the transcendent context because  one of the things i would say that's  happened to me is because i've spent so
fIEKfr9CaZA,2496800,2502720,much time looking at the horrible things  that people have done  is that it's like jung said that he when
fIEKfr9CaZA,2502720,2509200,this is one of his famous quotes he said  no tree can reach up to heaven unless  its roots reach down to hell
fIEKfr9CaZA,2509200,2515200,and so as i've dug deeper into the  depravity of human beings
fIEKfr9CaZA,2515200,2523280,my sense of the possibility of human  beings has also grown  what would you say in proportion
fIEKfr9CaZA,2523280,2529599,and until i've become convinced actually  that good is a more powerful force than  evil  even though evil is an unbelievably
fIEKfr9CaZA,2529599,2536480,powerful force  and so i can't really strip the  transcendent away now whether what  bearing that has on eternity say on an
fIEKfr9CaZA,2536480,2541839,afterlife i mean  i i i can't say anything about that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2541839,2546960,the only thing i guess i can say is that  there are many things about  being that we don't understand in the
fIEKfr9CaZA,2546960,2552560,least and  we don't understand the nature of  consciousness or the nature of time
fIEKfr9CaZA,2552560,2559119,so i i'm not i wouldn't despair about  that but yes i think that  life can still be meaningful without
fIEKfr9CaZA,2559119,2565839,without  there being a necessity of an afterlife
fIEKfr9CaZA,2573119,2578319,so i might say well why are you going to  university  or i might say what are you doing right
fIEKfr9CaZA,2578319,2583760,now and then  the answer would be while i'm sitting in  class and then the question would be
fIEKfr9CaZA,2583760,2590400,well why are you sitting in class and  the answer that would be well because i  i want to take this course and
fIEKfr9CaZA,2590400,2595920,why well it's because i want to get my  degree so why  well because i want to be prepared for a
fIEKfr9CaZA,2595920,2602240,career and a  you know a productive and high quality  life when i get out  well why well you know you can keep
fIEKfr9CaZA,2602240,2607599,saying why  pretty much indefinitely and as you  answer you go farther and farther out in
fIEKfr9CaZA,2607599,2612640,time scales  now it's a tricky thing because one of  the things i might tell you
fIEKfr9CaZA,2612640,2618240,this is a very complex cognitive problem  is well where should you stop
fIEKfr9CaZA,2618319,2623599,so for example um i could say to you do  you want  a hundred dollars an hour do you want 50
fIEKfr9CaZA,2623599,2629680,000 years in 75 years  you're gonna think well i'll probably  take the hundred dollars now well
fIEKfr9CaZA,2629680,2635520,how about 200 years it's like well i'm  not gonna be there i'll take 100 bucks  now well so obviously thinking out 200
fIEKfr9CaZA,2635520,2641359,years is not that helpful  now you might think well no you should  calculate the effects of your actions
fIEKfr9CaZA,2641359,2647920,on it the fastest time span possible  and include the largest number of people
fIEKfr9CaZA,2647920,2653119,if you're really going to equilibrate it  but the problem is you can't do the  compute computations
fIEKfr9CaZA,2653119,2660560,because you get you get this thing  called combinatorial explosion happening  which is that it's like a chess board
fIEKfr9CaZA,2660560,2666800,you make one move okay fine but then you  could make four and then with each of  those you could make four more and then  with each of those you could make four
fIEKfr9CaZA,2666800,2672160,more and soon if you're looking 20 moves  ahead it's like there's so many moves  that the other person could possibly  make that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2672160,2678240,looking that far ahead is pointless you  can't do the computations  and so we don't know how far you should
fIEKfr9CaZA,2678240,2684000,look into the future  it depends on how stable your  environment is but
fIEKfr9CaZA,2684000,2689680,one month seems okay a year yeah three  to five years that's what i'll have you  do when you do the future authoring
fIEKfr9CaZA,2689680,2696560,program  20 years hmm  probably not and the reason for that is
fIEKfr9CaZA,2696560,2702960,the margin of error in your prediction  grows so large that  your prediction isn't worth anything and  you can really see how that's the case
fIEKfr9CaZA,2702960,2708400,now because like  what's going to be like in 20 years when  i was a kid i used to read science  fiction
fIEKfr9CaZA,2708400,2716319,it's like plausible accounts of the  potential future it's like  now who knows anything could happen
fIEKfr9CaZA,2716319,2721839,anything could happen you know you could  be three-quarters robot in 20 years you  could have a lifespan of 10 000 years i
fIEKfr9CaZA,2721839,2728000,mean  we just do not know we could be living  in caves again with everything in runes  we don't have a clue what's going to
fIEKfr9CaZA,2728000,2733599,happen so 20-year span  i would say you know get friendly with  computers
fIEKfr9CaZA,2733599,2739119,so 20 years spans too long so okay  anyways what i'm what i'm pointing out  is that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2739119,2746240,you have to calculate you have to  calculate what you're doing across  multiple spans of time and in that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2746240,2751680,combination  you know in combination with many many  people and that makes things very  complex but that's how
fIEKfr9CaZA,2751680,2761520,that's how you're building the  structures that you live
fIEKfr9CaZA,2761520,2766720,there's this thing that exists this this  multi-headed snake  and it's got this infinity problem it's
fIEKfr9CaZA,2766720,2772720,everywhere that's that little circle  down there  and the problem is well what do you do  with it you cut off one head seven more
fIEKfr9CaZA,2772720,2780720,grow  that's the eternal problem of life and  the problem is  there there is the category of problems
fIEKfr9CaZA,2780720,2786720,in life  and it ain't going anywhere and so the  question is  can you deal with the whole category at
fIEKfr9CaZA,2786720,2792240,the same time  that's the thing that's how to be in the  world is to deal with that category all
fIEKfr9CaZA,2792240,2797760,at the same time  and so how did how did human beings what  did they come up with as a solution and
fIEKfr9CaZA,2797760,2803280,that's so cool too because the solution  they come up with not only was the  heroism that allows you to approach
fIEKfr9CaZA,2803280,2809920,what you're terrified by and what you  find offensive and to learn from it  but also the idea of sacrifice and that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2809920,2815520,was played out by cultures everywhere  including human sacrifice and you think  what the hell was up with those crazy
fIEKfr9CaZA,2815520,2821440,bastards so long ago they were  sacrificing to gods all the time  what kind of clueless behavior was that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2821440,2826560,burn something and  please god burn something valuable and  please god
fIEKfr9CaZA,2826560,2832560,it's like what was with them what were  they thinking  well they weren't stupid those people if
fIEKfr9CaZA,2832560,2839359,they were stupid we wouldn't be here  they were not stupid and believe me they  lived under  a lot harsher conditions than we do so
fIEKfr9CaZA,2839359,2846400,those were some  tough people man you know back then  you'd last about 15  minutes and so you don't want to be
fIEKfr9CaZA,2846400,2851920,thinking of your ancestors as stupid  like there's no real evidence that we're  much different cognitively than we were
fIEKfr9CaZA,2851920,2858400,150  000 years ago so anyways  sacrifice what does that mean sacrifice
fIEKfr9CaZA,2858400,2864559,well it's a discovery man it's the  discovery of the future  it's like the future is actually the
fIEKfr9CaZA,2864559,2870480,place where there is threat  and it's always going to be there so  what do you do you make sacrifices in
fIEKfr9CaZA,2870480,2875680,the present so that the future  is better right everyone does that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2875680,2881599,that's what you're doing right now  that's what you're doing here that's  what your parents are doing when they  pay money to send you to university
fIEKfr9CaZA,2881599,2887119,they think you can bargain with reality  it's amazing you can bargain with
fIEKfr9CaZA,2887119,2893520,reality you can forestall  gratification now and it'll pay off
fIEKfr9CaZA,2893520,2899040,at a place in time that doesn't even  exist yet  it's like who would have believed that
fIEKfr9CaZA,2899040,2904720,it's like that's a miracle that that  occurs  and it's not like people just figured  that overnight you know
fIEKfr9CaZA,2904720,2910880,we were chimps for christ's sake like  how are we going to come up with an idea  like that  well it's like well we thought about it
fIEKfr9CaZA,2910880,2916319,for seven million years  and you know we got to the point where  we could kind of act it out
fIEKfr9CaZA,2916319,2922720,but we didn't know what we were doing  but it was a it merged  like a dream it was so the terror of the
fIEKfr9CaZA,2922720,2927760,future is a dream  and the solution to the terror the dream  of the terror of the future
fIEKfr9CaZA,2927760,2933599,is another dream and and it comes out in  mythology and in fantasy and in drama
fIEKfr9CaZA,2933599,2939680,where you act out the sacrifice  and then it's a step on the way to full  understanding so we can say
fIEKfr9CaZA,2939680,2945280,sacrifice now instead of doing it you  know although we still do it  it's just not concretized like it used
fIEKfr9CaZA,2945280,2950960,to be  we do it abstractly and we all have  faith that it will work
fIEKfr9CaZA,2950960,2957599,you know and we also set up our society  so that it'll work and  one thing about you know i'm not a fan
fIEKfr9CaZA,2957599,2963119,of moral relativism  for a variety of reasons partly because  i think it's an it's an extreme form of
fIEKfr9CaZA,2963119,2969200,cowardice  but anyways apart from that no no  no no there's minimal ways that you can
fIEKfr9CaZA,2969200,2974880,set up a society that will work  and so one of them is is that the  society has to be set
fIEKfr9CaZA,2974880,2980800,up so that your sacrifices will pay off  or you won't work  and then the society will die and so it
fIEKfr9CaZA,2980800,2988240,has to make promises  people have to make promises to one  another that's what money is  money is a promise that your sacrifice
fIEKfr9CaZA,2988240,2993520,will pay off in the future  that's what money is and so if the  society is stable
fIEKfr9CaZA,2993520,2999280,you can store up your work right now  you can sacrifice your impulses and you
fIEKfr9CaZA,2999280,3004960,can work  and you can store up credit for the  future  and then you can make the future a
fIEKfr9CaZA,3004960,3010559,better place but society has to be  stable enough  to allow for that hyperinflation will do
fIEKfr9CaZA,3010559,3015680,you in  so the promise that's implicit in the  currency is the promise that what you're
fIEKfr9CaZA,3015680,3021599,doing now will pay off in the future  and if people don't have that promise  then well we know what they do
fIEKfr9CaZA,3021599,3027440,because in in gangs for example in say  gangs in north america  the time horizon of the gang members
fIEKfr9CaZA,3027440,3033119,shrinks rapidly because they don't  really expect to be alive that much past  21  and so they get really impulsive and
fIEKfr9CaZA,3033119,3038480,violent and like why the hell not that's  that's what you do when when the future  doesn't
fIEKfr9CaZA,3038480,3045040,matter when it's not real you you  default back to living in the moment and  you take what you can get right now
fIEKfr9CaZA,3045040,3051119,and no wonder because you don't know if  you're going to be around you know in a  year  and you get whatever you can well you
fIEKfr9CaZA,3051119,3056319,can bloody well get it  and that's like anarchy that state and  so you don't want to live in some people
fIEKfr9CaZA,3056319,3061520,like to live in that state because  they're really wired for that you know  and so they're they're much more
fIEKfr9CaZA,3061520,3067680,comfortable in those conditions they're  they're kind of like warrior types i  would say in some sense but
fIEKfr9CaZA,3067680,3073040,you know for most people that's just  wet that stress will just do you in you
fIEKfr9CaZA,3073040,3082400,know the stress of a life like that
fIEKfr9CaZA,3082400,3088480,how hard should you work well that's a  really difficult question if you're  going to die tomorrow
fIEKfr9CaZA,3088480,3094720,and then you probably shouldn't work  very hard today at all  so one thing you might say is that the
fIEKfr9CaZA,3094720,3100400,degree to which you should work hard  is dependent on your assumptions about  the stability of the future
fIEKfr9CaZA,3100400,3107359,we actually know this to be true because  if you put people in  wildly uncertain circumstances they
fIEKfr9CaZA,3107359,3112559,discount the future  which is exactly what you should do  right it only makes sense to store up
fIEKfr9CaZA,3112559,3118000,goods  for future consumption if the future is  likely to be very similar to the past
fIEKfr9CaZA,3118000,3123440,and the present  you need a stable society for that and  conscientiousness only works in in a
fIEKfr9CaZA,3123440,3129280,stable society  because all you do otherwise if you're  piling up goods which is kind of what  conscientious people do
fIEKfr9CaZA,3129280,3134960,is leaving them there for the criminals  to take or waiting for the next chaotic  upheaval to wipe out everything that
fIEKfr9CaZA,3134960,3140640,you've stored  and so even conscientiousness is a kind  of guess hard-working people say well
fIEKfr9CaZA,3140640,3146400,you know uh sacrifice the present for  the future that's great as long as the  future is going to be there and you can
fIEKfr9CaZA,3146400,3151839,predict it but if it's not going to be  there and it's unpredictable then  the right response is take what you can
fIEKfr9CaZA,3151839,3158640,take right now well the getting's good  now you know obviously there are  troubles with that too and i'm speaking
fIEKfr9CaZA,3158640,3164079,you know i'm i'm offering rough rules of  thumb  but i'm trying to provide you with some
fIEKfr9CaZA,3164079,3170480,indication of  how and why these difference in value  structures exist  because they're applicable in different
fIEKfr9CaZA,3170480,3176319,environments you know sometimes  in a dangerous social environment it's  not obvious that being an extroverted
fIEKfr9CaZA,3176319,3181680,person is a good idea because  extroverted people they stand out  especially if they're extroverted and
fIEKfr9CaZA,3181680,3186960,creative right because not only are they  noisy and  and dominant and assertive they're also
fIEKfr9CaZA,3186960,3192880,colorful  and and flamboyant and provocative well  that's great if you're in a society that
fIEKfr9CaZA,3192880,3199200,rewards that sort of thing  but if you have you know if you're ruled  by  an authoritarian king who wants
fIEKfr9CaZA,3199200,3205760,absolutely no threat whatsoever to his  stability ever  then dressing in gray and shutting the
fIEKfr9CaZA,3205760,3223838,hell up  is a really good survival tactic
fIEKfr9CaZA,3237920,3240000,you
