3-GVwKTaZRM,226159,231200,is very volatile and bad weather doesn't  always mean storms if it's too hot
3-GVwKTaZRM,231200,238000,planes might be forced to restrict loads  or require a longer runway most commonly  in cities like phoenix and las vegas but
3-GVwKTaZRM,238000,244319,industry experts say that's not the crux  of the problem there are always going to  be weather cancellations there are
3-GVwKTaZRM,244319,251280,always going to be cancellations due to  air traffic control that's not the big  picture here right now this is an
3-GVwKTaZRM,251280,257120,industry in crisis there's now a growing  scrutiny around the industry's handling  of the billions it received in pandemic
3-GVwKTaZRM,257120,263360,relief money meant to ensure the  airlines were ready for post pandemic  travel but thousands of employees left
3-GVwKTaZRM,263360,268479,the industry and despite companies  cutting back their summer flying  schedules to improve reliability
3-GVwKTaZRM,268479,275280,staffing shortages are still fueling  disruptions how long is this chaos going  to last it's a great question and i'm
3-GVwKTaZRM,275280,281440,sorry to say i don't see an end in sight  this is really unprecedented in terms of  the number of cancellations that are
3-GVwKTaZRM,281440,288240,occurring so close to departure time  and emily joins us now live from newark
3-GVwKTaZRM,288240,293520,airport tonight emily i feel for those  passengers i was one of them this  weekend who couldn't fly out with the
3-GVwKTaZRM,293520,299440,airline so understaffed what are  passengers saying about the rebooking  even the hotel booking process if people
3-GVwKTaZRM,299440,305840,are stuck in a city they're not from  tom this has been the conversation of so
3-GVwKTaZRM,305840,311440,many concerned travelers for background  airlines are required to give you a  refund for your ticket if your flight
3-GVwKTaZRM,311440,318000,has been canceled but airlines have  varying policies when it comes to how to  handle delayed passengers some will
3-GVwKTaZRM,318000,323360,offer a meal or hotel voucher in certain  circumstances but so many travelers
3-GVwKTaZRM,323360,330000,we're hearing from say it barely makes  up for the costs they have to put out as  a result of a rebooked flight tom
3-GVwKTaZRM,330000,336160,yeah and i can tell you from experience  it was impossible to get anyone on the  phone this weekend i know you have some  tips for travelers flying out this
3-GVwKTaZRM,336160,341520,summer that hopefully will help them  going forward  yeah and with july 4th right around the
3-GVwKTaZRM,341520,347919,corner this is absolutely something top  of mind for so many of us travel experts  say if you can try to book an early
3-GVwKTaZRM,347919,353360,morning flight get airline alerts sent  directly to your phone and uh rather if
3-GVwKTaZRM,353360,358720,your flight is canceled be proactive in  rebooking uh or seeking out that
3-GVwKTaZRM,358720,365360,potential refund tom back to you yeah  you have to really be proactive you  can't wait on the airline at least  that's what i what i found out all right
3-GVwKTaZRM,365360,370639,emily we thank you for all that emily  academy leading us off tonight for more  on this travel crisis and if it could
3-GVwKTaZRM,370639,376479,get worse let's bring in managing editor  at the points guy to travel website  clint henderson he's a travel expert so
3-GVwKTaZRM,376479,383199,clint it seems like everyone has had  trouble recently with airline travel  emily mentioned in her piece that a lot  of the issues going on are airline
3-GVwKTaZRM,383199,389360,industry related rather than just  weather is there any resolution in sight  when it comes to these shortages
3-GVwKTaZRM,389360,395280,so unfortunately it looks like we've  gone from sold out summer to a summer of  armageddon is what we're calling it in
3-GVwKTaZRM,395280,401520,the newsroom uh it's been like this  really since christmas time though  you've seen every weekend it seems like
3-GVwKTaZRM,401520,407919,it's a different airline that's  cancelling 10 even 20 of their flights  and there's just no wiggle room anymore
3-GVwKTaZRM,407919,414639,so if you get weather that goes bad in  one location  it means cruise it means planes are out
3-GVwKTaZRM,414639,419680,of position and  it used to be the airlines were able to  pick up the slack they cannot do that
3-GVwKTaZRM,419680,424960,anymore so that's why you're seeing them  start to reduce the number of flights  the number of destinations they just
3-GVwKTaZRM,424960,430960,don't have the staff to to fix the  problems when they pop up and let's face  it a thunderstorm in the summertime
3-GVwKTaZRM,430960,436400,shouldn't bring an airline to its knees  it's just not the way it doesn't it  doesn't make any sense clint and summer
3-GVwKTaZRM,436400,442639,of armageddon we're going to steal that  that's that's a great way to sort of  characterize what's happening across the  country delta seem to have the most
3-GVwKTaZRM,442639,448800,cancellations at least in florida and  new york there was no contact from the  airline their twitter page was silent
3-GVwKTaZRM,448800,454400,all weekend i don't know if we've heard  from the ceo this is sort of strange are  they running out of fumes right now i
3-GVwKTaZRM,454400,460000,just i just wonder if they're in crisis  mode for the summer  you know i think delta has always had a
3-GVwKTaZRM,460000,466080,great reputation as the operational  reliability leader  we've seen that get a little tarnished
3-GVwKTaZRM,466080,472560,this year and you know i it's hard to  blame the airlines they're just they  can't hire the people they need in
3-GVwKTaZRM,472560,478879,airports at ticket counters for pilots  for flight attendants those folks a lot  of folks just left the business and
3-GVwKTaZRM,478879,484879,they're not getting back into it and it  takes a long time to train a pilot so  you can't just pump out a new class of
3-GVwKTaZRM,484879,492400,pilots so you know the airlines are sort  of caught between a rock and a hard  place  that said we did bail them out a few
3-GVwKTaZRM,492400,498639,times as i recall and so we were hopeful  that when the demand returned which it  certainly has that they'd be more
3-GVwKTaZRM,498639,504240,prepared than they have been so far  colin i do want to mention you know we  asked for a delta representative they
3-GVwKTaZRM,504240,510800,refused to come on but i have to ask you  on that last point you were mentioning  if they knew they were going to have  these shortages why are they booking
3-GVwKTaZRM,510800,516080,these flights  well you know i think the airlines  missed out on a lot of profits during
3-GVwKTaZRM,516080,522320,the pandemic and they want to make up  for that by you know selling out planes  and selling out flights uh the problem
3-GVwKTaZRM,522320,529200,is you know they have scaled back this  summer delta being a leader in that you  know reducing flights about 100 flights
3-GVwKTaZRM,529200,535279,starting july 1st other airlines like  alaska have cut 10 of their flights but  still they're not able to meet the
3-GVwKTaZRM,535279,541360,demand that's out there so this is a  tricky one and you know i think they're  gonna have to cut some more this summer
3-GVwKTaZRM,541360,546560,in order to get back on their feet  clint henderson from the points guy
3-GVwKTaZRM,546560,552000,along with his dog there behind who also  looks upset at the travel season this  this summer clint we thank you for
3-GVwKTaZRM,552000,557120,coming on top story tonight all right we  want to switch years now to a tragedy  that happened over this weekend gun

3-GVwKTaZRM,773040,778560,all right stephen we thank you for that  we turn to the economy now and growing  fears that the u.s is barreling towards
3-GVwKTaZRM,778560,785279,a recession new models predicting a  steep downturn is likely by the start of  2024 but president biden insisting it
3-GVwKTaZRM,785279,790639,can still be avoided nbc's maura barrett  is traveling with the president this  weekend and has more on the political
3-GVwKTaZRM,790639,796560,fallout  tonight president biden away from the  white house but still fighting back
3-GVwKTaZRM,796560,802079,against fears of a recession there's  nothing inevitable about a recession  biden addressing reporters near his home
3-GVwKTaZRM,802079,809440,in rehoboth beach delaware back on his  feet after taking a tumble while riding  his bike over the weekend
3-GVwKTaZRM,810480,815600,the president today explaining his foot  got caught in a pedal strap it got stuck
3-GVwKTaZRM,815600,822720,on the right side  but even on vacation the president
3-GVwKTaZRM,822720,828079,unable to distance himself from the  rocky state of the economy the former  director of the national economic
3-GVwKTaZRM,828079,835600,council under president obama delivering  this stark assessment the dominant  probability would be that by the end of
3-GVwKTaZRM,835600,841360,next year  we would be seeing a recession in the  american economy that probability
3-GVwKTaZRM,841360,847760,growing greater by the day according to  bloomberg economics the chance the u.s  would be in a recession by the start of
3-GVwKTaZRM,847760,853360,2024 was virtually zero back in february  by mid-march it had climbed to nearly 20
3-GVwKTaZRM,853360,858560,percent and now following the fed's  highest interest rate hike since 1994
3-GVwKTaZRM,858560,866320,that likelihood stands at 72 percent but  the biden administration insisting a  recession is not certain fate i expect
3-GVwKTaZRM,866320,871360,the economy to slow  it's been growing at a very rapid rate
3-GVwKTaZRM,871360,879199,as the economy as the labor market has  recovered and we've reached full  employment it's natural now that we
3-GVwKTaZRM,879199,884399,expect a transition to  steady and stable growth but i don't
3-GVwKTaZRM,884399,889680,think a recession is at all at all  inevitable biden repeatedly shifting the
3-GVwKTaZRM,889680,895760,blame attempting to pin the country's  economic woes on everyone from vladimir  putin we've never seen anything like
3-GVwKTaZRM,895760,902399,putin's tax on both food and gas to gop  lawmakers the problem is
3-GVwKTaZRM,902399,908399,republicans in congress are doing  everything they can  to stop my plans to bring down costs on
3-GVwKTaZRM,908399,915040,ordinary families but ultimately the  president paying the price for soaring  inflation poll numbers show just 29
3-GVwKTaZRM,915040,921839,percent of americans approve of biden's  handling of the economy his overall  approval rating plunging to 39 percent
3-GVwKTaZRM,921839,927360,with just 16 percent of americans saying  the country is on the right track
3-GVwKTaZRM,927360,933279,all right maura barrett joins us now  live from the white house so more those  numbers speak for themselves the  president knows he needs to do something
3-GVwKTaZRM,933279,939519,to get his approval rating back up and  he was asked about the possibility of a  gas tax holiday today
3-GVwKTaZRM,939519,945839,tom we've learned the white house is  considering either a gas rebate card for  americans or a gas tax holiday which
3-GVwKTaZRM,945839,953360,would save consumers about 18 cents per  gallon at the pump the catch though that  gas tax pays for roadway infrastructure
3-GVwKTaZRM,953360,958880,which is something the biden  administration celebrated just last year  as it was signed into law regardless
3-GVwKTaZRM,958880,964720,biden's saying today he plans to make a  decision on the gas tax by the end of  this week tom
3-GVwKTaZRM,964720,969920,all right mora we thank you for that for  more on the headwinds president biden  can't seem to get past i want to bring
3-GVwKTaZRM,969920,975519,in nbc news digital senior political  reporter john allen for more so john you  know the president's gotten some
3-GVwKTaZRM,975519,982720,criticism for being too insulated  there's been a lot of reporting out  there that he's not really getting the  the real story on everything from you
3-GVwKTaZRM,982720,987759,know the gas prices to inflation to to  the child formula crisis what are you
3-GVwKTaZRM,987759,993759,hearing about this and can the president  get through this  i think there are absolutely a lot of  democrats who believe that the president
3-GVwKTaZRM,993759,1000480,is insulated i mean it's hard to believe  at this point that he's not fully aware  because he talks about it about  inflation uh about the infant formula
3-GVwKTaZRM,1000480,1006560,crisis about other goods and services  that americans are having trouble  getting or having trouble paying for um
3-GVwKTaZRM,1006560,1013279,that said uh it is very difficult to  counter inflation um and so what you're  hearing now and from morrow's report is
3-GVwKTaZRM,1013279,1019600,more thinking inside the white house not  only about what they can do to actually  counter inflation but what they can do  to show people that they are attempting
3-GVwKTaZRM,1019600,1025918,to counter inflation so we talk about  like a gas tax holiday for example um  from a you know a larger economic
3-GVwKTaZRM,1025918,1031120,perspective most economists would frown  on that and say it's not really going to  do a lot at the same time it's something
3-GVwKTaZRM,1031120,1036240,that makes people feel better and makes  gas a little bit cheaper in the short  term  so john you know on that point you were
3-GVwKTaZRM,1036240,1042319,talking about there's not too much you  can do about inflation you know uh the  body administration has been putting  that out along with the gas prices as
3-GVwKTaZRM,1042319,1048480,well but they seem to be also getting  getting caught flat-footed on some  issues  even this weekend this travel issue we
3-GVwKTaZRM,1048480,1053520,sort of knew about this pilot shortage  and of course the white house can't  solve every problem but i just wonder if
3-GVwKTaZRM,1053520,1059760,they're if they're sort of operating  from the back step and they're not  taking the initiative on other issues  what's your take on that
3-GVwKTaZRM,1059760,1067200,when i talk to white house officials uh  depending on which ones you talk to but  some of the white house officials i've  spoken to uh who wish to remain
3-GVwKTaZRM,1067200,1074000,anonymous uh said that they are  concerned about just what you were  talking about the president is insulated  that uh his top advisors don't
3-GVwKTaZRM,1074000,1080400,necessarily bring him uh problems  quickly that there's a lot of desire to  keep him happy and then as a result of
3-GVwKTaZRM,1080400,1085520,that he is caught as you suggested  flat-footed a lot  so what what are you hearing about
3-GVwKTaZRM,1085520,1091679,president biden's plans to run for  re-election in 2024 we seem to kind of  the story kind of sort of pops up then
3-GVwKTaZRM,1091679,1097039,it goes away and it comes up again it  seems to be back percolating is there  anything to it
3-GVwKTaZRM,1097039,1102400,when you talk to people inside the white  house they all insist that he is running  for reelection uh he has said that he is
3-GVwKTaZRM,1102400,1107919,running for re-election what we have not  seen is uh the kind of um gearing up for
3-GVwKTaZRM,1107919,1113600,a campaign that you might expect for a  president who is at such a low approval  rating and really is going to need to
3-GVwKTaZRM,1113600,1119120,figure out what his argument is to the  american people for giving him another  four years at a time when uh the broad
3-GVwKTaZRM,1119120,1125039,majority of the public doesn't approve  of how he's doing and that said  democrats other than president biden are
3-GVwKTaZRM,1125039,1130480,moving forward with their own uh  political operations you see bernie  sanders out there endorsing candidates
3-GVwKTaZRM,1130480,1137440,he's uh you know basically ready to run  if biden doesn't according to his uh  according to his top campaign aides uh
3-GVwKTaZRM,1137440,1143120,elizabeth warren has been very public  lately about how she thinks the country  uh could could be doing better than it
3-GVwKTaZRM,1143120,1149520,is so uh if biden doesn't run there's a  whole group that's ready to run of  course kamala harris the vice president  would be first among those in terms of
3-GVwKTaZRM,1149520,1155200,people likely to run and at the same  time  you know when you look at that group  they are a little bit waiting for biden
3-GVwKTaZRM,1155200,1160880,and at the same time not uh not  completely standing on the sidelines  john allen for us tonight john we
3-GVwKTaZRM,1160880,1167200,appreciate you being on top story we  thank you for everything we want to turn  out of the battle for ukraine we are  hearing for the first time tonight from
3-GVwKTaZRM,1167200,1173679,the kremlin about those american vets  captured on the front lines in ukraine  now held by russia nbc senior
3-GVwKTaZRM,1173679,1179760,international correspondent keir simmons  sat down with president putin's press  secretary dmitry peskov for an exclusive
3-GVwKTaZRM,1179760,1185679,interview on the fate of those americans  and a viewer note russia is cracking  down on journalists and limiting what
3-GVwKTaZRM,1185679,1192720,reporters can say under threat of  imprisonment  tonight the kremlin's first comments
3-GVwKTaZRM,1192720,1199360,after two american veterans on the front  lines in ukraine were captured by  pro-russian forces russian television
3-GVwKTaZRM,1199360,1205360,has broadcast interviews with two  americans captured in ukraine alex  drewkey and andy wenn
3-GVwKTaZRM,1205360,1212480,where are they  who is holding them  and what happens next they're soldiers  of fortune and they were involved in
3-GVwKTaZRM,1212480,1217600,illegal activities on the territory of  ukraine  they were involved in firing and
3-GVwKTaZRM,1217600,1224000,shelling our our military personnel they  were endangering their life  they should be held responsible for
3-GVwKTaZRM,1224000,1231120,those crimes that they have committed  in an exclusive interview i asked  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov about
3-GVwKTaZRM,1231120,1238640,the two british nationals and the  moroccan captured by separatist rebels  in ukraine now sentenced to death
3-GVwKTaZRM,1238640,1245200,can you guarantee that these americans  will not  face the same fate
3-GVwKTaZRM,1245200,1250720,no i cannot guarantee anything it  depends on the investigation  and we asked about another american
3-GVwKTaZRM,1250720,1255919,being held in russia wnba star brittany  greiner who was detained at the airport
3-GVwKTaZRM,1255919,1262880,in february accused of carrying vape  cartridges with hashish oil she was  coming to take part in sport in russia
3-GVwKTaZRM,1262880,1269200,effectively trying to build bridges  through sports it's a terrible message  isn't it that she should be arrested it
3-GVwKTaZRM,1269200,1276880,is also a terrible message to to bring  some forbidden essences  and materials to this country and it is
3-GVwKTaZRM,1276880,1282080,prosecuted by russian laws the special  presidential envoy for hostage affairs
3-GVwKTaZRM,1282080,1287440,is now leading the u.s effort uh to  secure brittany grinder's release
3-GVwKTaZRM,1287440,1294320,so  the u.s government is now approaching  this as a hostage situation i would  strongly disagree with that we cannot
3-GVwKTaZRM,1294320,1299440,call her hostage  she violated russian law
3-GVwKTaZRM,1299440,1304480,and now she is being prosecuted  nato leaders now warning of a long
3-GVwKTaZRM,1304480,1311039,conflict in ukraine it may be one view  russia agrees on  are we in for a long
3-GVwKTaZRM,1311039,1319840,uh conflict here  yes it will be a long lasting crisis we  will never trust west anymore
3-GVwKTaZRM,1320080,1326880,all right kira simmons joins us now live  from moscow tonight kyra i understand  you have some new reporting you were  told during that interview that these
3-GVwKTaZRM,1326880,1331960,americans will not be treated as  prisoners of war
3-GVwKTaZRM,1332320,1338240,that's right tom in that interview i  asked dimitri peskov whether russia  would abide by the geneva conventions in
3-GVwKTaZRM,1338240,1345679,relation to these two american veterans  who are being held  in ukraine by pro-russian forces and he
3-GVwKTaZRM,1345679,1351120,said quite pretty much explicitly that  they would not be that they would not be  treated as prisoners of war folks will
3-GVwKTaZRM,1351120,1357120,know that that will have real  implications for the way that they are  treated even for the potential that they
3-GVwKTaZRM,1357120,1363039,could be put on trial and even face  something like a death sentence so that  will be really worrying for the families
3-GVwKTaZRM,1363039,1368559,of these men  so here you know we also uh i know you  also addressed some speculation about
3-GVwKTaZRM,1368559,1374159,putin's health  that's absolutely right tom indeed
3-GVwKTaZRM,1374159,1379440,people will have seen the reports about  uh varying reports uh about president
3-GVwKTaZRM,1379440,1384720,putin's well-being about his health i  asked dmitry peskov directly about that
3-GVwKTaZRM,1384720,1390159,take a listen  to comment on it um there's been a lot  of talk about president putin's health
3-GVwKTaZRM,1390159,1395840,uh you've called it ridiculous um  pointed out that he appears on  television said that he's in good shape
3-GVwKTaZRM,1395840,1401760,you've denied several times that he's  terminally ill as has been suggested um
3-GVwKTaZRM,1401760,1408159,many reports you've read them yourself  and yet people have suggested that at  times he has seemed as if he is limping
3-GVwKTaZRM,1408159,1414400,as if he's shaking as if he's gripping  the table  uh  can you address that once and for all
3-GVwKTaZRM,1414400,1420000,what i suggest is that you uh you watch  his uh performance on the uh you watch
3-GVwKTaZRM,1420000,1425600,his performance on the saint petersburg  economic forum for three and a half  hours
3-GVwKTaZRM,1425600,1431600,his uh his speech delivering the speech  and then taking part in a panel  discussion
3-GVwKTaZRM,1431600,1436640,and just think  if an unhealthy man  can perform like that
3-GVwKTaZRM,1436640,1444400,and also i can tell you one thing that  yesterday  yesterday uh i know we uh
3-GVwKTaZRM,1444400,1451279,in the afternoon  uh actually he played hockey  it's about yesterday he was playing
3-GVwKTaZRM,1451279,1457960,hockey  and then think about his health by  herself
3-GVwKTaZRM,1459200,1464640,and you know tom we say again and again  that it's impossible to know what's  really going on within the walls of the
3-GVwKTaZRM,1464640,1470640,kremlin the kremlin are incredibly uh  protective of its of its secrets and  particularly of course of president
3-GVwKTaZRM,1470640,1477760,putin but fascinating and impactful to  hear dmitry peskov a president putin's  spokesman there directly addressing
3-GVwKTaZRM,1477760,1484400,those questions about president putin's  health and denying uh that he is  suffering in any sense uh with health
3-GVwKTaZRM,1484400,1490640,issues tom all right keir simmons with a  very big interview and a lot of news for  our viewers tonight here we appreciate
3-GVwKTaZRM,1490640,1496159,it back here at home we want to turn to  the forecast now relentless heat hitting  millions with temperatures expected to
3-GVwKTaZRM,1496159,1501600,climb up to nearly 110 degrees in some  areas but first take a look at this
3-GVwKTaZRM,1501600,1509039,firefighters in new jersey battling a  massive wildfire in the wharton state  forest that blaze reaching 11 000 acres
3-GVwKTaZRM,1509039,1514320,and is now 50 percent contained for more  on those scorching temperatures uh nbc
3-GVwKTaZRM,1514320,1519600,meteorologist bill karins joins us now  bill so where is the heat going to be a  danger really
3-GVwKTaZRM,1519600,1525919,it's shifting it was over the weekend  and today in areas like minnesota  minneapolis was 101 degrees record high
3-GVwKTaZRM,1525919,1531440,for them fargo hit 100 over the weekend  and now we're going to watch it shifting  a little bit now it's going to head back
3-GVwKTaZRM,1531440,1536960,towards the midwest areas like st louis  and chicago you're under are going to  under heat advisories over the next
3-GVwKTaZRM,1536960,1542559,couple days also a little part of  california too and as far as the extreme  heat goes though we have to wait until
3-GVwKTaZRM,1542559,1548400,wednesday and thursday so every red dot  on this map shows you where a record  high could be broken so this was today
3-GVwKTaZRM,1548400,1555600,in areas of the northern plains and then  tomorrow a little bit in the midwest and  the south and then throughout the deep  south as we go throughout thursday and
3-GVwKTaZRM,1555600,1560720,these temperatures are going to be not  only challenging daily records but  potentially monthly records and maybe
3-GVwKTaZRM,1560720,1566480,even all-time records in a few isolated  cases so chicago tomorrow 99 st louis 99
3-GVwKTaZRM,1566480,1572000,little rock 99 dallas 100 you get the  idea atlanta's back up in 98 tomorrow
3-GVwKTaZRM,1572000,1577120,but look what happens as we go through  wednesday and thursday mobile alabama
3-GVwKTaZRM,1577120,1582880,103 to 104. usually you think of these  places down towards the gulf they cool  off with a sea breeze in the afternoon
3-GVwKTaZRM,1582880,1588400,some thunderstorms it's a very dry air  mass this is a very unusual weather  pattern for this portion of the country
3-GVwKTaZRM,1588400,1593600,it's not going to be that humid it's  going to be like being in arizona in the  desert heat with low humidity in florida
3-GVwKTaZRM,1593600,1601360,of all places and that allows the  temperature to get hotter watch  tallahassee on thursday the hottest  temperature ever in tallahassee was 105.
3-GVwKTaZRM,1601360,1607840,right now they're predicting 104 degrees  and by the way we do have an outside  chance of at least one or two locations
3-GVwKTaZRM,1607840,1613120,challenging the all-time florida high  temperature record which is 109 degrees
3-GVwKTaZRM,1613120,1618240,in the panhandle back in 1931 tom so  it's been a long time since that record
3-GVwKTaZRM,1618240,1624159,has been broken uh we'll wait and see  thursday could be a close call  all right i'm down here in florida so
3-GVwKTaZRM,1624159,1631279,i'll let you know bill i'll let you know  how hot it is all right man have a good  one we thank you for that still ahead  tonight the cab chaos a new york city
3-GVwKTaZRM,1631279,1638720,taxi plowing into pedestrians on a  manhattan sidewalk how a group of people  rush to save two women pinned by the
3-GVwKTaZRM,1638720,1645360,vehicle plus the tourists trapped in a  cable car over the himalayan mountains  the frightening moments they were forced
3-GVwKTaZRM,1645360,1652320,to climb down a single rope and the vote  by swimming's international governing  body that restricts transgender athletes
3-GVwKTaZRM,1652320,1658080,from competing a u.s olympian and gold  medalist joins top story next the  reaction tonight from inside the
3-GVwKTaZRM,1658080,1664930,swimming community stay with us  [Music]
3-GVwKTaZRM,1666480,1672159,we are back now with a decision that's  making waves in the world of sports and  beyond the swimming world's governing
3-GVwKTaZRM,1672159,1678640,body fina has decided it will restrict  transgender athletes from competing in  elite women's events including leah
3-GVwKTaZRM,1678640,1684480,thomas the first openly transgender  woman to win an ncaa  division one title erin mclaughlin
3-GVwKTaZRM,1684480,1691279,reports  thomas wins the ncaa championship just  three months after u-pen swimmer leah
3-GVwKTaZRM,1691279,1697520,thomas became the first openly  transgender athlete to win an ncaa  division one title
3-GVwKTaZRM,1697520,1703600,this morning swimming's international  governing body is imposing new  restrictions for trans women on sunday
3-GVwKTaZRM,1703600,1710480,fina which partners with the  international olympic committee  overwhelmingly voting in favor of new  rules effective today saying
3-GVwKTaZRM,1710480,1717600,transformers must have completed their  transition by age 12 to be eligible to  participate in women's competitions
3-GVwKTaZRM,1717600,1723520,athletes would also have to prove that  they've continuously suppressed their  testosterone levels since their  transition
3-GVwKTaZRM,1723520,1729120,it is a policy  that we need to introduce in order to
3-GVwKTaZRM,1729120,1735200,protect the competitive fairness  of our of our event the new rules which
3-GVwKTaZRM,1735200,1742000,do not impact ncaa athletes mean trans  swimmers who transitioned after showing  signs of puberty will no longer be able
3-GVwKTaZRM,1742000,1748559,to compete at the olympics or world  championships at the fina vote some  olympic swimmers speaking out in support
3-GVwKTaZRM,1748559,1754640,of the new rules that men and women are  physiologically different cannot be  disputed in march leah thomas had
3-GVwKTaZRM,1754640,1760960,completed 34 months of hormone  replacement therapy surpassing the  ncaa's 12-month requirement to compete
3-GVwKTaZRM,1760960,1766880,on the women's team  but her participation in the pool was  met with controversy with many arguing
3-GVwKTaZRM,1766880,1771919,thomas had an unfair physical advantage  an idea she refuted in an interview with
3-GVwKTaZRM,1771919,1777360,abc news trans women are a very small  minority of all athletes and we haven't
3-GVwKTaZRM,1777360,1784559,seen any  massive uh wave of trans women  dominating i am very devastated by this
3-GVwKTaZRM,1784559,1790960,decision skyler baylor is a friend of  leah's and is the first trans athlete to  compete for an ncaa division one men's
3-GVwKTaZRM,1790960,1796559,team  what does this mean for leah and her  future  knowing her imagine that she will fight
3-GVwKTaZRM,1796559,1802640,as much as she can  for her right to compete just like  anybody else  leah thomas has declined our request for
3-GVwKTaZRM,1802640,1808880,comment fina also says they will work to  establish an open category for trans  athletes to be able to compete at an
3-GVwKTaZRM,1808880,1815600,elite level but that move is also  receiving criticism with some arguing a  separate category for trans women will
3-GVwKTaZRM,1815600,1821200,further exclude them from the sport back  to you  all right we thank aaron for that story
3-GVwKTaZRM,1821200,1827919,and joining us now for more on these  restrictions is nancy hogshead macar a  former american swimmer who represented
3-GVwKTaZRM,1827919,1835039,the u.s at the 1984 summer olympics  winning three gold medals and a vocal  supporter of the fina decision thank you
3-GVwKTaZRM,1835039,1840399,so much for joining top story tonight i  want to get right into this so does the  requirements signal these new
3-GVwKTaZRM,1840399,1846399,requirements they signal that swimming  isn't welcoming and inclusive at a time  when so many leagues especially in the
3-GVwKTaZRM,1846399,1852080,u.s are attempting to expand their  diversity and inclusion efforts could  this hurt the sport long term what do
3-GVwKTaZRM,1852080,1859200,you think  yeah i think that by characterizing this  as anti-trans that it's somehow meant to
3-GVwKTaZRM,1859200,1865039,harm trans people  that you're really alienating a lot of  the swimming and a lot of the sport
3-GVwKTaZRM,1865039,1871600,community because  what people can see when they saw leah  thomas or laurel hubbard is what they
3-GVwKTaZRM,1871600,1876720,can see with their own eyes is the  difference between men and women's  sports
3-GVwKTaZRM,1876720,1883919,and we we know well  that if we did not have a women's sports  category exactly what it would look like
3-GVwKTaZRM,1883919,1890559,it would look like the nba the nfl  national hockey league major league  baseball  none of them prohibit women from
3-GVwKTaZRM,1890559,1897840,participating  but  in order to give women equal  opportunities they need their own team
3-GVwKTaZRM,1897840,1903279,so nancy i want to go back to the ncaa  women's swimming championship in march
3-GVwKTaZRM,1903279,1910880,okay i'm sure you were watching leah  thomas she won the 500 yard freestyle  but she also came in fifth and last in
3-GVwKTaZRM,1910880,1917519,her two other races so like most  athletes she's competing but not always  winning clearly she can be beat what
3-GVwKTaZRM,1917519,1922559,does that tell you about the quote  unquote advantage argument for fina's  decision
3-GVwKTaZRM,1922559,1929519,so even with the times that she's swam  first of all it's it's it's embarrassing  that you would even call her getting
3-GVwKTaZRM,1929519,1935840,last she got eighth place out of 13th  place
3-GVwKTaZRM,1943919,1950880,nancy nancy that was not an attack on  her and you know it wasn't just just if  you could focus on the question i would  really appreciate it no no no i'm saying
3-GVwKTaZRM,1950880,1956480,that that's an attack on women's sports  too  it's not it's not an attack on women's
3-GVwKTaZRM,1956480,1963200,support it was just where she placed it  was the wrong word i would agree it was  the wrong word that's not what i was  asking the point of the question was she
3-GVwKTaZRM,1963200,1970080,had been beat so let's focus on that  please  well if if uh if somebody if 18 gets
3-GVwKTaZRM,1970080,1976480,fourth in the final four  you don't say that they lost  right you don't say like nancy can you
3-GVwKTaZRM,1976480,1982720,answer the question you're going on a  tangent please  i can ask it again you're going on a  tangent yeah okay
3-GVwKTaZRM,1982720,1988000,so what we know is that uh when you well  what i was told i'm i was part of the
3-GVwKTaZRM,1988000,1993200,decision-making process when uh the ncaa  was coming up with its transgender rules
3-GVwKTaZRM,1993200,1999360,that were going and what i was told was  that if somebody took a year of gender  affirming hormones that they would move
3-GVwKTaZRM,1999360,2005360,laterally so if they were hypothetically  500 this is the exact words i was told
3-GVwKTaZRM,2005360,2012320,that they would move to 500 in the  women's category and now we know that  that's not true so we have the best
3-GVwKTaZRM,2012320,2018640,scientists in the world saying that you  cannot balance  uh inclusion with fairness
3-GVwKTaZRM,2018640,2026080,so you've got to pick one and then just  be honest about which  what what is your higher order priority
3-GVwKTaZRM,2026080,2032399,and given that the women's category is  meant to serve  half  of the world's population
3-GVwKTaZRM,2032399,2039200,so that we can have an opportunity to  win and succeed  you know i i i firmly support the
3-GVwKTaZRM,2039200,2045679,boundaries around the girls and women's  category before we get to that second  question which is okay
3-GVwKTaZRM,2045679,2050720,well how do we include i mean in this  open category how do we do it
3-GVwKTaZRM,2050720,2056240,and there are lots of answers to that  but first we got to have that  the the
3-GVwKTaZRM,2056240,2062960,exactly what fina did we need to have  that first nail down  i hear you i hear you um leah thomas
3-GVwKTaZRM,2062960,2068000,today she put out a new statement i want  to read it to our viewers um this is  what you said about the ruling she said
3-GVwKTaZRM,2068000,2074398,the new fina release is deeply upsetting  it is discriminatory and will only serve  to harm all women
3-GVwKTaZRM,2074398,2081280,if you could talk to leah thomas face to  face what would you tell her about why  you think she shouldn't compete
3-GVwKTaZRM,2081520,2088398,well first i mean just i have a lot of  empathy for leah as a human being and  for her transition
3-GVwKTaZRM,2088398,2094158,in how she wants to be successful in  the classroom and public accommodations
3-GVwKTaZRM,2094158,2100960,and  um in family law et cetera but when it  comes to women's sports i hope that
3-GVwKTaZRM,2100960,2108480,because she's an ivy league  student that she can recognize  how it's not fair her own times
3-GVwKTaZRM,2108480,2114400,are almost they they mirror what science  tells us what science tells us is that
3-GVwKTaZRM,2114400,2121280,the shorter the distance the harder it  is for somebody to roll back male  puberty so her time in the 100 and the
3-GVwKTaZRM,2121280,2128320,200 freestyle  very little roll back time at all  um and none of her times
3-GVwKTaZRM,2128320,2135520,rolled back to where she would have been  if um  you know sort of equivalent to what the
3-GVwKTaZRM,2135520,2141520,gap is between men and women  i want to read you just one more thing  it's from one of america's most
3-GVwKTaZRM,2141520,2147040,influential athletes megan repino she  had this is what she had to say when  asked about transgender inclusion in
3-GVwKTaZRM,2147040,2153599,sports yesterday she said quote show me  the evidence that trans women are taking  everyone's scholarships are dominating
3-GVwKTaZRM,2153599,2160160,in every sport are winning every title  i'm sorry it's just not happening so we  need to start from inclusion period do
3-GVwKTaZRM,2160160,2166480,these new restrictions promote  discrimination against transgender  athletes so that's the question for you  do you think they they promote
3-GVwKTaZRM,2166480,2175040,discrimination and i understand this is  this is not a simple complex and it is  it is very very complex for both sides
3-GVwKTaZRM,2175040,2180240,yeah about 10 years ago i heard the term  trans women are women and of course i
3-GVwKTaZRM,2180240,2187599,was like yes  100  but then  to recognize that hold on in this in a
3-GVwKTaZRM,2187599,2193440,very few areas there's a conflict of  rights  women's sports is one of them i would
3-GVwKTaZRM,2193440,2199520,say  that having leah be able to compete did  trans the whole transgender movement no
3-GVwKTaZRM,2199520,2205280,favors because on my phone was the  athletes their families these are very
3-GVwKTaZRM,2205280,2211760,liberal people that have grown up in the  sport of swimming that swimming and  track and field are uniquely
3-GVwKTaZRM,2211760,2216800,co-ed we see more so than just about any  other sportsies like soccer or softball
3-GVwKTaZRM,2216800,2222000,or volleyball exactly what the  differences are between men and women  and

3-GVwKTaZRM,2227200,2233920,was a pleasant experience for leah  and um you know it asking people
3-GVwKTaZRM,2233920,2241200,to ignore facts and science  doesn't do the cause any favors
