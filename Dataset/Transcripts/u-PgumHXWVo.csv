u-PgumHXWVo,2879,8880,we just got done with the police  what they told us is that the footage we  shot wasn't beautiful
u-PgumHXWVo,8880,12960,it wasn't pretty enough it didn't meet  their standard
u-PgumHXWVo,15120,21279,i told you to delete it suddenly these  guys are documentary filmmakers i don't  get it
u-PgumHXWVo,24540,31679,[Music]  egypt a country famous for its history
u-PgumHXWVo,31679,37280,the river nile  the vast sahara desert  and its ancient pyramids
u-PgumHXWVo,37280,42719,it's also a country i'll never return to  again we're trying to keep a low profile  and soon you'll know why you shouldn't
u-PgumHXWVo,42719,48239,go either keep rolling but be less  obvious there's a very dark very real  side to this country few travel shows
u-PgumHXWVo,48239,53520,and travel hosts are willing to expose  but let me back up and zoom out for a
u-PgumHXWVo,53520,60719,second  egypt is one of africa's 54 countries  yes egypt is in africa and egyptians are
u-PgumHXWVo,60719,66640,africans but many also consider them  middle eastern  the language arabic the main religion is
u-PgumHXWVo,66640,72200,islam which becomes immediately apparent  as you hear calls for prayer blaring  from surrounding mosque speakers
u-PgumHXWVo,72200,80080,[Music]  more than 95 percent of the country is  dry arid desert which means the nile is
u-PgumHXWVo,80080,86240,a vital lifeline to this country of 100  million  cairo is one of the biggest cities in
u-PgumHXWVo,86240,92320,africa with a population of over 10  million after we landed in cairo
u-PgumHXWVo,92320,98560,that's when everything started going  wrong  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,98560,105680,soon after arriving in the country and  pulling up at our hotel our bags were  x-rayed then opened then searched
u-PgumHXWVo,105680,112000,then the police came from around 4 30  a.m to 10 a.m we were outside the lobby
u-PgumHXWVo,112000,117759,in the cold and more and more police  coming asking us all types of questions  treating us like criminals suspecting us
u-PgumHXWVo,117759,123759,of something but i don't know what  for four hours we were interrogated by  authorities wondering who we are and
u-PgumHXWVo,123759,131520,what we're doing here  in the end they confiscated our lights  hard drives batteries and cameras
u-PgumHXWVo,131520,137040,what i couldn't figure out then was what  were these guys so paranoid about
u-PgumHXWVo,137360,142480,and then i read about egypt's revolution  the arab spring spreads to egypt with a
u-PgumHXWVo,142480,148560,day of rain demanded the resignation of  then-president hussein  they were scenes that gripped the
u-PgumHXWVo,148560,151360,world's attention
u-PgumHXWVo,154000,159440,in december 2010 this so-called  democratic republic faced mass  demonstrations the people were
u-PgumHXWVo,159440,166000,challenging authorities over poverty  corruption and political repression many  of these protests were held in cairo in
u-PgumHXWVo,166000,171360,the city center incredibly close to the  hotel where they just confiscated our  gear
u-PgumHXWVo,171360,177360,over a period of weeks demonstrations  reached a climactic and tragic head on  january 25th
u-PgumHXWVo,177360,183440,on that date the people made their  voices heard  by demanding president murabak to stand  down
u-PgumHXWVo,183440,189920,the murabak regime responded with  violence  in the end he did step down but future
u-PgumHXWVo,189920,195040,leaders never forgot the impact and  power the people had  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,195040,202400,now even years later there's a paranoia  that envelops the city especially  leading up to january 25th we landed
u-PgumHXWVo,202400,208640,here on january 16th  i regret this immediately
u-PgumHXWVo,208640,214720,oh  i just had a good idea  without camera come take a look at this  beauty my team and i have decided to
u-PgumHXWVo,214720,222159,shoot this series using iphones  still our problems are just beginning  right now the van is at a police station
u-PgumHXWVo,222159,229040,they've gone through the shots on my  phone don't know what's going to happen  next
u-PgumHXWVo,229120,234959,even with just phones even though we  have a valid shooting permit it's not  exactly a laws here cairo's overzealous
u-PgumHXWVo,234959,240400,paranoid police are on top of us they  don't even wear uniforms stopping us  asking us to delete shots they don't
u-PgumHXWVo,240400,247920,find beautiful this guy behind me he can  be poised  but probably not
u-PgumHXWVo,249360,254640,in this series you're gonna witness the  real egypt a straightforward  documentation of what it's really like
u-PgumHXWVo,254640,259759,to be a filmmaker in africa's worst  country for shooting
u-PgumHXWVo,259919,265840,along the way we're watching our backs  and ducking into alleyways  all to capture the most delicious oh my
u-PgumHXWVo,265840,271520,gosh unique food flavors you'll find  anywhere i was not expecting that
u-PgumHXWVo,271520,276880,from bustling cairo this place is wild  it's mad it's very busy sorry am i on  your way see you see what i'm saying let
u-PgumHXWVo,276880,282160,me do a spin move right here boom we're  good  to chaotic camel market we've almost
u-PgumHXWVo,282160,288720,literally effing run over about five  times now when you're here you need to  watch your back and your friends back
u-PgumHXWVo,288720,294639,to the center of the sahara desert far  far from police here it's completely  peaceful and there's something really
u-PgumHXWVo,294639,300960,interesting like when everyone's quiet  it's real silence
u-PgumHXWVo,300960,306479,you'll see the food they're eating about  one sheep every two weeks that's like 25  a year that's a lot
u-PgumHXWVo,306479,312320,but you'll also see the people kind  locals completely unlike the boorish  authorities who run this place this is
u-PgumHXWVo,312320,318400,the boss of the camel  from another mother  i came to egypt to introduce an audience
u-PgumHXWVo,318400,325199,of over 8 million to this country's  heartwarming cuisine and friendly locals  instead i have no choice but to be
u-PgumHXWVo,325199,330400,honest and transparent laws here are  unclear people just kind of do what they  want to do
u-PgumHXWVo,330400,336720,in this four video series you will see  food are people eating this yes you will  experience culture and i will reveal the
u-PgumHXWVo,336720,346039,dark realities of being a traveler in a  country that treats its tourists like  criminals it all starts here
u-PgumHXWVo,352160,357840,as the first rays of light pierced  through the trees and old dust-cake  buildings of cairo a small window of
u-PgumHXWVo,357840,364919,peace gradually fades away replaced by  the hustle and bustle of city life
u-PgumHXWVo,371680,378479,cars motorbikes bicycles and the  occasional horse or donkey populate the  streets
u-PgumHXWVo,378479,384460,crowds are massive and move like schools  of fish with a beautiful chaos like no  place i've seen before
u-PgumHXWVo,384460,391280,[Music]  let me be clear i like this city it has  character on camera it looks amazing
u-PgumHXWVo,391280,396720,however i don't like and i don't respect  the people who run it
u-PgumHXWVo,398240,405360,day one location one  our conniving and mostly useless local  producer has brought us here
u-PgumHXWVo,405360,412160,a small street side eatery on a quiet  road  low traffic means a lower chance of  suspicious police or quickly forming
u-PgumHXWVo,412160,417599,mobs  sounds great but what's on the menu
u-PgumHXWVo,418200,424319,[Music]  we are in the kitchen of our first  location and i'm excited because i don't
u-PgumHXWVo,424319,430400,know what people in egypt eat for  breakfast but right now i'm getting a  little bit of a hint behind me he is  frying french fries and he just made
u-PgumHXWVo,430400,436800,falafel too the falafel here is made  with fava beans and then fried until  they look like little honky pups for now
u-PgumHXWVo,436800,443840,i'm going to go to the serving area  where they have so much food and i'm  going to decide what we're going to eat  officially for breakfast today let's go
u-PgumHXWVo,443840,448880,this is saad alharibi a restaurant named  after its owner mr assad specializes in
u-PgumHXWVo,448880,455680,dishes that use fava beets fava beans  are a common breakfast here in cairo  with over 40 years of experience sod can
u-PgumHXWVo,455680,461120,mix and match flavors in over 50 ways  hello sir good morning
u-PgumHXWVo,461599,467360,he's really busy right now  here he has about 15 different dishes  and tons of flavor combination so people
u-PgumHXWVo,467360,473520,come they step up they order and then  he's kind of the main guy making it  happen someone just ordered a chip  sandwich
u-PgumHXWVo,473520,479520,another chip sandwich i should get one  of those  oh so now he's not busy
u-PgumHXWVo,479520,485680,hey  we connected after all oh my god see it  just takes persistence  so right now he's gonna make me a chip
u-PgumHXWVo,485680,491520,sandwich he's got the soft bread here  puts in the chips some salt and then  this is a white sauce i'm not sure what
u-PgumHXWVo,491520,498080,that is yet he puts in some salad some  greens carrots a little bit of cabbage  in there  can this be the plate
u-PgumHXWVo,498080,503520,please yes  yes
u-PgumHXWVo,503520,509360,and he won't give it to me at all i  promise i'll pay  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,509360,515279,crunchy  there's something delectable about  putting a soft carbohydrate with a  crunchy chips i don't know if you guys
u-PgumHXWVo,515279,521919,are poor like me but when i grew up i  would just make a potato chip sandwich  with ketchup or with butter and so it  takes me back to those days to the days
u-PgumHXWVo,521919,527519,of my impoverished youth  most flavor is coming from the salt he  added and the tahini tahini is kind of
u-PgumHXWVo,527519,533040,new for me i don't know if i've had that  before tahini it's an arabic condiment  made from toasted ground hold sesame
u-PgumHXWVo,533040,539040,seeds made into a paste here you'll see  it join most meals the tahini it's  salting a bit of sweet sourness i don't
u-PgumHXWVo,539040,545440,know i need to try that more to kind of  pin it down the bread is excellent it's  soft it's chewy it's a great little  treat before you eat your actual
u-PgumHXWVo,545440,551600,breakfast which we're gonna do next  aside from chip sandwiches they have  something called
u-PgumHXWVo,551600,558070,the fool is something that is eaten  commonly for breakfast here all  throughout the city of cairo and what it  is it's fava beans
u-PgumHXWVo,558070,565279,[Applause]  fava beans are one of the oldest  cultivated plants with evidence of their  incorporation into egyptian diets dating
u-PgumHXWVo,565279,570399,back to at least 6 000 bc now in present  day they're a staple in egypt used in
u-PgumHXWVo,570399,576880,dishes like food and falafel  a soupy dish made with stewed fava beans
u-PgumHXWVo,576880,582800,salt and pepper corn oil tahini and  chili sauce it kind of looks like  refried beans in a way but it probably
u-PgumHXWVo,582800,589360,tastes different because it has spices  in there too falafel a bean cake made  with vava beans spices garlic and herbs
u-PgumHXWVo,589360,594720,rolled it into balls and deep fry this  is a kind of a typical egyptian  breakfast something you might expect to
u-PgumHXWVo,594720,600959,see in the morning here in cairo and  it's beautiful  there's a huge selection people probably
u-PgumHXWVo,600959,606560,wouldn't order as many things but i have  let's take a look at these did i mention  french fries for breakfast i can't say
u-PgumHXWVo,606560,611600,that this is rare i'm looking around i  see almost everybody here has ordered  the french fries
u-PgumHXWVo,611600,617120,here this is falafel i'm going to break  that open oh very nice looking extra  crispy fried and delicious as far as i
u-PgumHXWVo,617120,622399,know it's not meant to be eaten with  anything i'm just going to try playing  like this let's go for it
u-PgumHXWVo,623120,628160,super crunchy and pretty airy too  falafels not always my favorite  sometimes i find falafel can be really
u-PgumHXWVo,628160,634880,dry but here this is one of my top pilaf  ones i've ever had i think because  they're using a different type of bean  it's much more airy and light and it's
u-PgumHXWVo,634880,640000,not just like a thick big chunk of fried  stuff the main reason i came here is for
u-PgumHXWVo,640000,646640,this this is called full and this is a  very common breakfast that you'll see in  cairo you can't really eat it with your  hands it's not really a spoon provided
u-PgumHXWVo,646640,652800,you kind of lap it up with the bread  right here this bread is super famous  here in cairo it's called egyptian bread
u-PgumHXWVo,652800,659000,and i want to go right now to see how  it's made and then we get teleported
u-PgumHXWVo,662079,667680,behind me now an egyptian bread bakery  you can see from the front the fresh  bread coming out people buying it over
u-PgumHXWVo,667680,674160,here but we're going to go into the back  and see what few people have seen before  let's go
u-PgumHXWVo,674160,680720,here it's a very tight fit it's enough  space for the ingredients and the oven  that's basically all that's here
u-PgumHXWVo,680720,686720,in the back room you can see they're  making the flour they're making the  dough
u-PgumHXWVo,686800,694720,made with a simple recipe this is the  backbone of egyptian cuisine  hearty thick gluten rich round and flat
u-PgumHXWVo,694720,701040,it's consumed with almost all egyptian  meals eaten fresh daily street side  bakeries like this are found on every
u-PgumHXWVo,701040,706920,block with delivery men nimbly balancing  racks of fresh bread on their heads
u-PgumHXWVo,706920,712320,[Music]  weighing in the back room tucked away  from the daylight you see where the
u-PgumHXWVo,712320,718320,process begins he's already made the  dough and then he portions it into these  perfect little balls and it goes on top
u-PgumHXWVo,718320,724560,of this powder this powder is like a  wheat flour that's been baked its only  purpose is to make the dough not stick
u-PgumHXWVo,724560,729240,to the sheet and look at how he moves
u-PgumHXWVo,730000,735839,of these big old pieces of wood gets  about 15 to 20 on there now this is  gonna hang out here in this room for
u-PgumHXWVo,735839,741760,about 20 minutes to an hour during that  time it's gonna flatten out naturally  and then it's gonna be ready to go into
u-PgumHXWVo,741760,746880,the oven that's the next step but here i  just want to appreciate the skill i mean  look at this it's like an optical
u-PgumHXWVo,746880,752880,illusion how is he doing it  nice thank you  boom  boom
u-PgumHXWVo,752880,758560,[Music]  we are now at the roasting station so  this is where it's going to go from
u-PgumHXWVo,758560,763680,dough to something beautiful  he's gently peeling it off of this dust
u-PgumHXWVo,763680,769360,it's like a wheat dust that everything  rests on and the way he flips it in his  hand it kind of helps expand the dough
u-PgumHXWVo,769360,775519,and then that gets plopped onto here  this is a conveyor belt it's super hot  hundreds of degrees you can hear the
u-PgumHXWVo,775519,781440,fire underneath heating it up  so they bake hundreds of these at a time
u-PgumHXWVo,781440,786880,load them up on the conveyor belt and  that just moves and moves continuously  and on the other end let me tell you my
u-PgumHXWVo,786880,796959,hubby b  that is magical  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,796959,802399,the bread is completely done and they  lay it out here so people are coming  every minute every second ordering big
u-PgumHXWVo,802399,808079,bags of this bread and sometimes you see  people they'll grab these big pallets of  bread put it on their head and they'll
u-PgumHXWVo,808079,814160,even ride a bike while carrying the  bread and delivering it to different  restaurants or different families  they're bringing a fresh one here right
u-PgumHXWVo,814160,821279,now oh and i'm like yes yes look at this  oh it is like a choo choo train it's  full of steam it's hot it's toasty on
u-PgumHXWVo,821279,826880,the top you can see the different  textures the bottom texture has been  affected by sitting in that wheat dust
u-PgumHXWVo,826880,832880,it's a bit rough and coarse and then on  this side of course you can see how it's  been toasted by the flame that is
u-PgumHXWVo,832880,839760,beautiful and it's so hot  [Music]  oh it's so delicious it's warm it's  stretchy it's soft it's a little bit
u-PgumHXWVo,839760,845040,toasty since it's so fresh this bread  plays a huge part in egyptian life not
u-PgumHXWVo,845040,850880,only incorporating calorie-dense  carbohydrates into the local diet for  thousands of years but it can also be
u-PgumHXWVo,850880,856880,used as a utensil pick up food scoop up  some sauce or wrap it around anything  you like
u-PgumHXWVo,856880,864720,so that's how you make egyptian bread  so i'm going to break off a piece i'm  going to dip it in the food i want to  really mix the contents mainly that bean
u-PgumHXWVo,864720,871560,but there's other flavor enhancers in  here too there's chili powder tons of  tahini try it out
u-PgumHXWVo,871839,878000,it's got a lot of flavor i mean it's  really starchy from the bean that's the  main thing i noticed the tahini is very  unique because it almost acts like a
u-PgumHXWVo,878000,885360,yogurt the way it's mixed with different  dishes but it's not dairy at all it's  crushed sesame seeds that have been  cured down into this thick sauce
u-PgumHXWVo,885360,890480,i'm feeling it not super bold flavors  but it's hearty it's savory and it kind  of gives you a lot of energy for
u-PgumHXWVo,890480,896160,starting your day the last thing i want  to try is this right here so this is the  one called mish mish is a traditional
u-PgumHXWVo,896160,902639,and pungent egyptian dish made by  fermenting salty cheese for several  months or even years that is intense
u-PgumHXWVo,902639,908639,super salty kind of pungent and then the  tomatoes offer some relief because it's  just so powerful it almost has a
u-PgumHXWVo,908639,914959,fermented quality to it but i like it it  seems like a good food to mix and match  with everything else you're getting some  new flavors and then you can move back
u-PgumHXWVo,914959,920000,over to the pool so this is it a  beautiful way to start your day a ton of  foods here and actually all of this for
u-PgumHXWVo,920000,925120,under five dollars you can't do much  better than that so that's breakfast we  have a lot more food to see today let's
u-PgumHXWVo,925120,930399,go  [Music]  we are on our way to our next location
u-PgumHXWVo,930399,936000,but first i saw a gentleman making  street food i like his style he's a  hustler he drove here on his motorcycle
u-PgumHXWVo,936000,942480,he brought all these ingredients and  he's making sandwiches and this reminds  me of these long thin bun meats they  have in vietnam so right here you see a
u-PgumHXWVo,942480,948000,long thin baguette bread so he just  takes an egg he cuts it into slices he  puts salt pepper and then he puts
u-PgumHXWVo,948000,954720,something they call here turkey cheese  the cost is about under a dollar i'm  gonna oh i don't
u-PgumHXWVo,954720,960079,feel weird eating long objects like this  on the internet i don't want you guys to  photoshop anything in my hand hold on
u-PgumHXWVo,960079,966240,i'm just gonna block your view  [Music]  wrong is this the best thing in the
u-PgumHXWVo,966240,971519,world no it's cheap it's quick it's easy  it tastes good there's soft bread here  and there's cheese oh cheese is very
u-PgumHXWVo,971519,976959,good the cheese has a very sharp almost  delightfully stinky smell to it what i  like most is just the story of what's
u-PgumHXWVo,976959,982639,going on here more than anything else i  like people who hustle and work their  ass off that's what he's doing here sir  hello

u-PgumHXWVo,1024959,1030880,to go back there now and maybe get  kicked out i didn't ask permission let's  go  koshering a type of mixed rice dish
u-PgumHXWVo,1030880,1038079,originated during the mid 19th century  this dish combines italian and arab  culinary elements

u-PgumHXWVo,1057679,1065360,fried onion and he flips it in and he  really gives it some style can we see it  boom there it is clip flip flip
u-PgumHXWVo,1065360,1070799,i gotta say his accuracy is not 100  about half of the fried onions are  actually getting into the container but
u-PgumHXWVo,1070799,1075840,it's a great show and all the people  they're looking up at us here they can't  see all the onions being chopped on the
u-PgumHXWVo,1075840,1082320,floor after the onions it gets the  tomatoes it gets the chickpeas but  that's just if you're getting it for  takeo if you're eating here like i am
u-PgumHXWVo,1082320,1088159,they build the rest of the dish at your  table let's go see what that looks like  now
u-PgumHXWVo,1088320,1094880,all right all right everything's  separated right now on this sauce they  put salt and pepper a little bit of  vinegar something spicy oh yes squeeze
u-PgumHXWVo,1094880,1102559,of lime or lemon and then they put that  on top of the beast right here that  looks incredible look at this
u-PgumHXWVo,1102799,1109120,i'm no expert but when you come to  places like this you have to look around  and see what other people are doing and  i see that no one just eats it from the
u-PgumHXWVo,1109120,1116270,top to bottom they mix it all up and  they get it all layered so all the  flavors are in each bite let me grab a  big spoonful that looks beautiful
u-PgumHXWVo,1116270,1122480,[Music]  wow it's like a spaghetti so it's like a  spaghetti but then you have the fried
u-PgumHXWVo,1122480,1128640,onions which adds an interesting  dimension of savoriness and then you've  got chickpeas in there they're almost  soggy but it adds a very different
u-PgumHXWVo,1128640,1134799,texture to everything  there is some meat on here but it's not  super easy to taste amongst everything  else a lot of this series is about me
u-PgumHXWVo,1134799,1141840,trying to figure out what egyptian food  even is because it's something i've  never experienced before now i'm in the  heart of the country i'm trying really
u-PgumHXWVo,1141840,1147039,authentically pure egyptian food can i  put my finger on exactly what egyptian  food is yet
u-PgumHXWVo,1147039,1152400,no but i need to keep trying i need to  keep eating  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1152400,1158640,just after filming kosheri the police  stopped us and made our production van  drive to the nearby police station they
u-PgumHXWVo,1158640,1164600,caught us in the sinful act of filming  bread on the sidewalk
u-PgumHXWVo,1165840,1171120,right now the fan is at a police station  all the local people have been taken out  of the van they've gone through the
u-PgumHXWVo,1171120,1176160,shots on my phone  and we don't know what's going to happen  next it's possible they'll try to delete
u-PgumHXWVo,1176160,1182720,the footage luckily we've already just  airdropped the footage to a  decoy phone so it doesn't matter but
u-PgumHXWVo,1182720,1187919,hopefully it doesn't get to that anyways  but this is what it's like to shoot here  all we were doing is
u-PgumHXWVo,1187919,1193919,shooting with phones on the street at a  bakery and that was enough to have our  whole vehicle have to be pulled into
u-PgumHXWVo,1193919,1200640,here to speak to the police and to  justify our actions even though we have  a permit to shoot doesn't matter
u-PgumHXWVo,1200640,1206840,so  not sure what's gonna happen we're gonna  find out pretty soon
u-PgumHXWVo,1209110,1215360,[Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1215360,1222000,so we just got done with the police  we're at our next location now get this  they told us to delete our footage why
u-PgumHXWVo,1222000,1228159,no reason do we have a permit yup do we  break a lot no as far as i can  understand it all depends on how the
u-PgumHXWVo,1228159,1234320,people at the top are feeling on that  particular day what they told us is that  the footage of the bakery we shot wasn't
u-PgumHXWVo,1234320,1240159,beautiful it wasn't pretty enough it  didn't meet their standard they told us  to delete it suddenly these guys are
u-PgumHXWVo,1240159,1246400,documentary filmmakers i don't get it so  did we actually delete it absolutely  none while we were waiting we airdropped
u-PgumHXWVo,1246400,1251679,all the footage to an extra phone that's  the phone i showed them and that's the  footage i deleted they don't even know
u-PgumHXWVo,1251679,1257039,how the phones work it's all the footage  is in my delete bin right now i can just  restore it at any time so that's
u-PgumHXWVo,1257039,1263440,fortunate but literally every minute  we're shooting in the city we're looking  over our shoulders we're constantly  paranoid and
u-PgumHXWVo,1263440,1269919,i don't really like it it's not that fun  to be honest but we have a job to do the  mission must go on i actually really  like this next food we're doing so i'm
u-PgumHXWVo,1269919,1276080,going to get to it oshie  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1276080,1282480,oh  my god when it comes to egyptian street  food hawashi is a big top contender and
u-PgumHXWVo,1282480,1288159,when it comes to hawashi well you must  come here the perfect place to film  street food while being shielded from
u-PgumHXWVo,1288159,1294640,the view of the police  this place is called hawaushi al-rafai
u-PgumHXWVo,1294640,1300559,they're known for their unique recipes  and a wide-ranging menu with tons of  variations like hiroshi with cheese or
u-PgumHXWVo,1300559,1307919,other various meats now the question  that must be answered what the heck is a  hawashi
u-PgumHXWVo,1310799,1316880,this is one of my favorite foods i've  tried so far i'm sorry i tried this one  without you guys sometimes i eat on my
u-PgumHXWVo,1316880,1322240,own time and it's one of my favorites so  here's how it starts first of all this  is just like the egyptian bread my man
u-PgumHXWVo,1322240,1328080,here he cuts the edges off so it can be  opened up easily then over here they're  weighing out some minced lamb meat that
u-PgumHXWVo,1328080,1335440,lamb meat is spiced it's delicious and  it gets spread kind of smeared by hand  within this bread disc hoboshi is a
u-PgumHXWVo,1335440,1342639,typical egyptian sandwich what makes  this place stand out are the secret  spices they put into the meat
u-PgumHXWVo,1342799,1349200,once a batch of hawashi is stopped they  bring him to the grilling station here  he puts it on this very hot griddle the
u-PgumHXWVo,1349200,1355280,meat's gonna cook through the bread  didn't get crispy and all of it is gonna  be absolutely delicious
u-PgumHXWVo,1357440,1362559,i've had this before but i've never had  it with cheese it's steaming up there's  spices there's lamb there's cheese it
u-PgumHXWVo,1362559,1367600,smells incredible  let me show you really quick i love this
u-PgumHXWVo,1367600,1373120,oh yes ooey gooey cheese on the inside  oh as he cuts it you can see the cheese
u-PgumHXWVo,1373120,1379360,squirting out that looks so good aside  from this we also have pickled  vegetables and we have tatini here now
u-PgumHXWVo,1379360,1385679,i've tried tahini a couple times today i  still don't quite know what it tastes  like because i haven't tried it alone
u-PgumHXWVo,1385840,1392720,interesting to me it's similar to a  hummus it's a little bit different  feeling in your mouth because it's not  made with chickpeas it's made with  sesame seeds but with the spice the salt
u-PgumHXWVo,1392720,1398799,the texture it's a little hummusy i'm  gonna try some of these pickled  vegetables right here we've got tomato  eggplant i'm gonna grab some of the
u-PgumHXWVo,1398799,1404960,carrot wow okay pickle overload i think  that is the palate cleanser but i need  to clench my palate from that with the
u-PgumHXWVo,1404960,1410799,pepsi  i've noticed in this country the pickles  are on another level they're super salty
u-PgumHXWVo,1410799,1416000,sour and spicy too it's kind of  addictive though it's such a powerful  flavor it punches you in the face like
u-PgumHXWVo,1416000,1421760,eating raw garlic but then after a while  it goes away it dissipates and you want  another hit this is why we're here oh
u-PgumHXWVo,1421760,1427440,beautiful cheese pull we'll try it out  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1427440,1433520,there's so many things to love the  texture is so crunchy the bread by  itself is amazing the meat is  beautifully seasoned almost a little bit
u-PgumHXWVo,1433520,1438640,like eating a seed kebab with all the  spices and flavors and just a very fine  mince take a look at this here you can
u-PgumHXWVo,1438640,1444880,see when i peel the top layer off the  cheese is still picky not too liquidy  not too solid give it a little bit of a
u-PgumHXWVo,1444880,1451279,dip is this what people do i'm assuming  it's there as a dip like ranch  [Music]  i don't know if i can say it's improving
u-PgumHXWVo,1451279,1457520,it it is adding a different level  different dimension it's like dipping  something that's already very delicious  and putting it into hummus it doesn't
u-PgumHXWVo,1457520,1463679,need anything extra it's beautiful just  how it is just like your wife girlfriend  whoever you're sleeping with i keep
u-PgumHXWVo,1463679,1469279,telling them that they love that stuff  i believe if it's not too late we've got  one more spot to go
u-PgumHXWVo,1469279,1473840,let's do it  if the police don't stop us
u-PgumHXWVo,1474880,1480960,in my head  [Music]  say that summer is dead our first day of
u-PgumHXWVo,1480960,1486480,shooting in cairo was quite a mixed bag  the police took our cameras
u-PgumHXWVo,1486480,1491840,our local egyptian producer turned out  to be completely incompetent and even  more police told us to delete our
u-PgumHXWVo,1491840,1499039,footage  i got to hang out with some really cool  kind people
u-PgumHXWVo,1499039,1507880,i ate some fantastic food my favorite  thing we've tried today  and i get to visit one of the seven  man-made wonders of the world
u-PgumHXWVo,1510150,1521440,[Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1521440,1526960,we are right outside the pyramids right  now we're going to ride the camels  because that's what you do when you come  here i've been told the first thing i
u-PgumHXWVo,1526960,1533440,should do is find a camel that speaks to  me  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1533440,1540760,this one just farted it has gas that's  how i know it's my spirit animal all  right this is a camel for me
u-PgumHXWVo,1542400,1548799,this series and my experience in egypt  they're both complicated  [Music]  i have nothing against the people of
u-PgumHXWVo,1548799,1555440,egypt i just think in a country that  makes 12 percent of its gdp from tourism  the police the authorities and those who
u-PgumHXWVo,1555440,1561679,run this place might want to stop  treating their tourists like spies and  criminals
u-PgumHXWVo,1565279,1572640,next time on day two against my better  judgment i'll be going for another round  in cairo let's hope it goes better than
u-PgumHXWVo,1572640,1580080,today  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1580080,1585120,right now we're in old cairo so here  they have a lot of really cool street  food and markets like this behind me
u-PgumHXWVo,1585120,1591600,what's on the menu i'm not sure yet  we're gonna go place to place dalton  stall and see who's gonna let us come in  and shoot some videos today i'm on a
u-PgumHXWVo,1591600,1596640,mission to discover this city's most  unique street food and then you eat to  me that was a donkey
u-PgumHXWVo,1596640,1601840,food i never expected to find here it is  so tender it is wild from sheepheads my
u-PgumHXWVo,1601840,1607919,tongue will meet this tongue let's go  all the way to pitches oh my god it's  happening this place is full of exotic
u-PgumHXWVo,1607919,1613440,surprises oh guys what is going on in  here hopefully we won't have another  surprise police encounter this guy
u-PgumHXWVo,1613440,1621760,behind me can give me boys  but i guess i'll have to find out but  probably not right after breakfast
u-PgumHXWVo,1625679,1631919,off the main roads if you duck into the  right alleyways you'll find clumps of  street food vendors like here next to an
u-PgumHXWVo,1631919,1638240,intersection in a residential area meat  sellers capitalize on the constant foot  traffic customers are lured in by the
u-PgumHXWVo,1638240,1642399,heavy wafts of grilled and fried beef
u-PgumHXWVo,1643360,1649360,boom we've come to our first destination  behind me we've got sausages liver but  look at this this is my favorite it's a
u-PgumHXWVo,1649360,1656960,big cow head it looks like it's been  dried or maybe a witch put a spell on it  i don't know let's go find out more
u-PgumHXWVo,1656960,1662880,and then this is where the magic happens  so it looks like everything here is beef  oriented that is sausage
u-PgumHXWVo,1662880,1669039,intestine sausage hall  liver  tongue
u-PgumHXWVo,1676720,1684720,it's just beefy there's no real  seasonings in it and it tastes like it's  been braised for like four or five hours  but this should be in something
u-PgumHXWVo,1686080,1692159,this beet is eaten in a sandwich various  beef cuts are sliced and tossed into a  pan called a holla there was something
u-PgumHXWVo,1692159,1698080,like this i saw in mexico but literally  the opposite this is concave that was  convex
u-PgumHXWVo,1698080,1705679,the fried beef bits are tossed into some  traditional egyptian bread along with  fried onions  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1705679,1712480,this is our first meal of the day this  is breakfast a bunch of random cow parts  i gotta say i love that unique frying
u-PgumHXWVo,1712480,1718480,creation where it has a little pit for  frying and then a big beach around it  for all the food to hang out and dry off
u-PgumHXWVo,1718480,1723840,really cool they have all types of  different cow parts here including the  esophagus right here we have the brazen
u-PgumHXWVo,1723840,1730559,station you can see they have everything  in there i mean what is that oh okay so  that is the esophagus it looks so
u-PgumHXWVo,1730559,1736880,bizarre it's like something from alien i  didn't know how to order it it looked  like they're still cooking it so uh  maybe next time for the esophagus but
u-PgumHXWVo,1736880,1742240,here inside of this bread we've got  onions liver sausage and then i think  they put a little bit of face oh take a
u-PgumHXWVo,1742240,1747279,look at it this looks real good let's go  for it  [Music]  i have no idea what body part that is
u-PgumHXWVo,1747279,1752399,it's quite good actually but super oily  but they have a nice salad on the side  here here we got onions tomatoes chilies
u-PgumHXWVo,1752399,1757520,and a little bit of cucumber it's kind  of like a arabic pico de gallo so i'm  going to use my bread just to pick up
u-PgumHXWVo,1757520,1762799,some of that try that out  so this is pretty good it's spicy  refreshing i like it i like it a lot on
u-PgumHXWVo,1762799,1769440,this side here that i believe is tahini  tahini a sort of hummus made of sesame  seeds it's found alongside most meals
u-PgumHXWVo,1769440,1775440,here i'm gonna just dip a little bit of  my meat in there  it's a bit nutty but it's not my
u-PgumHXWVo,1775440,1780640,favorite it's like a salt bomb in your  mouth but here beautiful seasoned beef  sausage with onions on top let's try it
u-PgumHXWVo,1780640,1786960,out  it's super rich super fatty but quite  delicious i think what they do here is  they got the bread i'm gonna put the
u-PgumHXWVo,1786960,1792840,sausage in there some onion i'm throwing  some of this on there and then i'm gonna  put all that in a little bit of the
u-PgumHXWVo,1792840,1798320,tahini that's delicious it's a lot of  powerful flavors but when you mix them  together it's quite delicious this is a
u-PgumHXWVo,1798320,1806470,good breakfast  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1806880,1814000,egypt is a muslim-majority country which  means most follow a strict halal diet  this means no pork no reptiles or other
u-PgumHXWVo,1814000,1820080,animals some might consider extreme  meats but when it comes to the animals  they do eat like lamb while people here
u-PgumHXWVo,1820080,1825600,eat everything including the head and  face  behind me a very popular street food
u-PgumHXWVo,1825600,1831840,stall here it's all about all the off  cuts from the sheep so you're going to  see head stomach organs sausage i saw
u-PgumHXWVo,1831840,1837760,sausage too the sausage is gigantic by  the way i was very impressed by it not  jealous just impressed
u-PgumHXWVo,1837760,1844159,oh my god come take a look so right here  we have just an inordinate amount of  different sheet parts here these lamb
u-PgumHXWVo,1844159,1850720,heads are boiled in local spices for  hours until the meat and fats break down  and become incredibly tender i have a
u-PgumHXWVo,1850720,1858320,big plate with the sheep head everything  everything although this meat may seem  exotic to some here it's no big deal oh
u-PgumHXWVo,1858320,1865840,he just cut me off a little piece of  sausage here that looks awesome there's  tons of rice in there let's try it out
u-PgumHXWVo,1866559,1874119,it's spicy and very tomatoey and full of  rice and some animal fat too that's good  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,1874480,1881200,this is my plate here he's finishing it  right now oh he's put some salt on it  some pepper oh  yes take a look at this so many
u-PgumHXWVo,1881200,1887360,different foods time to sit down and eat  let's do it  so far so good no one really seems to
u-PgumHXWVo,1887360,1892640,give a crap what we're doing right now  and most of the vendors we've gone to  have been pretty nice this guy was a  little impatient at first until i
u-PgumHXWVo,1892640,1898159,dropped a hundred pounds just like six  dollars and 30 cents and i said hey fill  up a plate that's what he did and he's
u-PgumHXWVo,1898159,1904000,been very happy to accommodate any of  our requests ever since here we have a  broth this reminds me of meat that i've
u-PgumHXWVo,1904000,1909600,had in mexico where they braise the meat  forever and they take the juice because  when you braise it for a long time a lot
u-PgumHXWVo,1909600,1915279,of the fat flavor is going to go out of  the meat and then into the broth so we  have that we have some bread and there
u-PgumHXWVo,1915279,1921519,always seems to be some kind of a little  bit of a salad on the side too all right  let's get into it first this is the
u-PgumHXWVo,1921519,1927200,tongue i'm gonna rip the tongue off of  here and then i'm gonna hit it with the  lime and try it out
u-PgumHXWVo,1927200,1933760,so i mean yeah satisfying there's  something about it it's got personality  very nice  all right next let's try the brain here
u-PgumHXWVo,1933760,1939200,you can see all the ridges in the brain  you know they say the more ridges you  have the smarter you are so maybe the
u-PgumHXWVo,1939200,1945760,sheep knew several languages it was  probably a polyglot  i'm gonna put this on the bread and  treat it like a topping for the bread
u-PgumHXWVo,1945760,1950000,all right this is my little brain taco  let's try it out
u-PgumHXWVo,1951039,1956880,i can't do like a oh that's so delicious  yummy face like i just say delicious  scallop or something it is brains it is
u-PgumHXWVo,1956880,1962559,creamy it's bold i probably put too much  of it on there if you're looking to get  gout so you can get disability leave i
u-PgumHXWVo,1962559,1969120,recommend eating this every day  i'm going to try this broth now  oh wow that is muttony if you are not a
u-PgumHXWVo,1969120,1975200,mutton fan i mean that is pure mutton  distilled down into a juice  electrolytes
u-PgumHXWVo,1975200,1981440,all right let's see what else they have  in here oh right here this was in  probably the inside of the cheek  somewhere so i'm gonna try that
u-PgumHXWVo,1981440,1987840,super rich soft tender the thing is  nothing has a ton of flavor here this is  some actual salt you can see uh all the
u-PgumHXWVo,1987840,1994159,fingerprints like a crime scene in there  i think people usually put a bit of that  salt onto the meat try it out
u-PgumHXWVo,1994159,1999679,this is a tough food for tourists  because if you come here and you don't  know the lay of the land you might walk  away a little bit disappointed or you
u-PgumHXWVo,1999679,2005440,might even say this didn't have enough  flavor but there's other flavor  enhancers all around it so you need to  mix and match until you get the right
u-PgumHXWVo,2005440,2010480,blend of flavors these are skills that  people here have grown up with they see  their parents how they're mixing and
u-PgumHXWVo,2010480,2016299,matching food that's what you gotta do  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2016480,2021759,this restaurant brings a whole new  meaning to the word slow and low
u-PgumHXWVo,2022080,2028399,this place is called nepha named after  the dish they sell el nagaji named after  the owner who cooks a lamb so
u-PgumHXWVo,2028399,2034159,mouth-watering it sells out each day we  have come to our next destination  i'm with the chef right now and take a
u-PgumHXWVo,2034159,2039200,look at this this is something  completely magical sheep that's been  cooked underground he's pulling the
u-PgumHXWVo,2039200,2044559,bones out now and it's so soft it looks  so delicious look at that that's like a  shoulder blade or something can i have
u-PgumHXWVo,2044559,2051040,that i'm gonna pull this meat right off  of the bone oh that looks so juicy take  a look at this this here is the nephi
u-PgumHXWVo,2051040,2057200,it's been around for more than 100 years  a lamb cooked in an underground oven  without any spices or seasonings the
u-PgumHXWVo,2057200,2063760,flavors come from the high quality wood  and fresh meat it's cooked low and slow  until every cut is fall off the bone
u-PgumHXWVo,2063760,2069440,soft i'm gonna try it out  wow that is delicious soft sticky tender
u-PgumHXWVo,2069440,2075599,oh  he said it melt in your mouth he said  you'd only have to bite you need to  squeeze it with your tongue against the
u-PgumHXWVo,2075599,2082960,roof of your mouth it is that soft can i  order uh one kilogram  okay please
u-PgumHXWVo,2083280,2089040,this looks incredible a huge platter  full of different mutton parts and i  have to say this reminds me so much of
u-PgumHXWVo,2089040,2094800,mexico right now there's a few parallels  between this and barbacoa the barbacoa  in mexico they also cook it underground
u-PgumHXWVo,2094800,2100960,and they also are famous for kind of  cooking it with no seasonings at all and  that's the same thing they've done here  beyond that in mexico you eat everything
u-PgumHXWVo,2100960,2108560,with a tortilla here you eat everything  with egyptian bread it's a very  different part of the world but kind of  a similar recipe
u-PgumHXWVo,2108560,2114800,i can't wait to try it out there's so  many yummy looking pieces here right in  the middle take a look this is a bunch  of different types of meat but that is
u-PgumHXWVo,2114800,2121280,still steaming hot it's shiny it looks  like it put on some baby oil and went to  the beach let's try it out  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2121280,2127040,that is so good and so rich so  incredibly heavy that's why they have  this here this is a salad and it cuts  through the heaviness a little bit but
u-PgumHXWVo,2127040,2133440,they also have this here this is called  salad dressing water some people also  call it egyptian whiskey the fact is it
u-PgumHXWVo,2133440,2140240,is zero percent alcohol which is  unfortunate but i'll try it anyways  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2140240,2146560,oh it might as well get you drunk it's  basically like vinegar chili powder  chilies maybe salt is really tense tense
u-PgumHXWVo,2146560,2153599,and intense  then we have right here the bread i'm  gonna make myself a little bit of an  egyptian barbacoa taco i'm gonna open
u-PgumHXWVo,2153599,2160640,this up and i'm gonna start layering in  some meat throw some herbs on there that  the tahini here we go
u-PgumHXWVo,2161359,2167040,oh man this is one of my favorite things  i've eaten so far in this country super  soft bread really flavorful natural
u-PgumHXWVo,2167040,2174000,tasting lamb and then maybe adding a  touch of salt from the tahini and that  is perfection i love it
u-PgumHXWVo,2174000,2180800,before we move on there's one more dish  the chef insists i try boiled lamb  testicles this is what the owner calls
u-PgumHXWVo,2180800,2186400,viagra it's funny right because you come  to an arabic country you think maybe  people are very conservative um not
u-PgumHXWVo,2186400,2192880,always oh they feel really gooey and  fatty he said i toss it back and i'll be  like a young virile man again here we go
u-PgumHXWVo,2192880,2196880,one shot of full sheet testicle
u-PgumHXWVo,2199280,2207119,it really just tastes like testicle soup  do you think i was gonna say chicken no  it's nothing like chicken not at all  it's patting gooey savory it's like kind
u-PgumHXWVo,2207119,2213760,of soupy a bit i'm worried about having  two maybe i'll have too much power my  wife's not here she's gonna get a visa
u-PgumHXWVo,2213760,2217389,[Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2222720,2227920,right now we're going to the very top of  a building a rooftop here in cairo  there's not a lot of space but they've
u-PgumHXWVo,2227920,2233440,got rooftops and here they keep  something very special let me show you
u-PgumHXWVo,2233950,2241240,[Music]  oh my gosh
u-PgumHXWVo,2243040,2248079,i regret this immediately  oh
u-PgumHXWVo,2248079,2253119,i just had a good idea  allow me to introduce you to the cairo
u-PgumHXWVo,2253119,2259359,craft of bird keeping in here there must  be 50 or so pigeons it's a crapload of  pigeons and actually speaking of a
u-PgumHXWVo,2259359,2264960,crapload look down here it's a load of  crap  in this city it's not uncommon to see
u-PgumHXWVo,2264960,2270880,men standing on rooftops waving a flag  and corralling their pigeons
u-PgumHXWVo,2270880,2276720,that's because around once a day the  birds are released and allowed to fly  freely to get some exercise oh my god
u-PgumHXWVo,2276720,2281839,it's happening yeah go go go wow this is  wild
u-PgumHXWVo,2281839,2287760,to communicate with the pigeons the bird  keeper uses a complex series of whistles  and gestures signaling whether they
u-PgumHXWVo,2287760,2294079,should fly higher or come home  amazingly they always return  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2294079,2299520,sometimes the bird keepers will have one  bird less and sometimes one bird more
u-PgumHXWVo,2299520,2304680,as you can see people here really love  their pigeons whether they look like  this or like this
u-PgumHXWVo,2304680,2310880,[Music]  right here we are on the side of the  street to be honest i don't know where  we are at all we're somewhere in cairo
u-PgumHXWVo,2310880,2316880,somewhere where we've not been caught  can you believe this guys we've shot  almost a whole day i don't want to jinx  it but i'm feeling pretty good about it
u-PgumHXWVo,2316880,2322960,here in this alleyway there's a special  shop selling a delicacy here in egypt  pigeon these pigeons are filled with the
u-PgumHXWVo,2322960,2329040,heavily and heavenly spiced rice-based  stuffing then deep fried until they're  crispy i've been told you can actually
u-PgumHXWVo,2329040,2336240,eat everything these bones seem thick  and hard i don't know how that's  possible let's see what happens
u-PgumHXWVo,2337200,2344480,oh that's super yummy it tastes like  buttery rice with fried chicken skin on  the outside oh man that's really nice
u-PgumHXWVo,2344480,2350720,i'm gonna kind of rip this spine back  someone told me i could eat this let's  see if i break my teeth
u-PgumHXWVo,2351440,2357760,hold on it's working i'm eating a pigeon  sponge and to be careful there's some  bone shards you don't want to kill  yourself on accident while eating this
u-PgumHXWVo,2357760,2362960,and that's something i advise with most  foods  here i'm going to wash it down with this  can you guess what it is is it coffee no
u-PgumHXWVo,2362960,2368720,it's pigeon soup let's try it out  oh wow oh my god i pure fat i think if
u-PgumHXWVo,2368720,2375119,this got to room temperature it would  turn solid like butter wow that's just  pure richness  so far i haven't really tried any of the
u-PgumHXWVo,2375119,2380720,pigeon meat just its spine and the  stuffing inside most of the meat is in  the pigeon breast i'm gonna try to rip
u-PgumHXWVo,2380720,2386480,it off and see if i can show you so that  right there is a little bit of rice and  the breasts it better be a lot of bang
u-PgumHXWVo,2386480,2391839,for the buck let's go  very beautiful like mediterranean spices
u-PgumHXWVo,2391839,2398240,soft juicy breast amazing buttery rice i  love it next time you're walking through  new york or chicago and you see hordes
u-PgumHXWVo,2398240,2403680,of pigeons collecting together don't be  disgusted think hey that's delicious  food i bet maybe collect one for
u-PgumHXWVo,2403680,2408839,yourself and bring it to an egyptian guy  don't do that  maybe i'll try it
u-PgumHXWVo,2408839,2415760,out for our final stop we have something  really special a restaurant with a  complex of cooking stations serving

u-PgumHXWVo,2492720,2495040,until
u-PgumHXWVo,2498320,2501770,[Laughter]
u-PgumHXWVo,2505359,2511760,is known as the food of kings a  traditional egyptian soup made from jute  leaves a sort of egyptian spinach this
u-PgumHXWVo,2511760,2518800,soup is so intense it used to be  outlawed in egypt for its alleged  aphrodisiac effects
u-PgumHXWVo,2520839,2527200,okay  and just like that it's over  here we have a whole table full of food
u-PgumHXWVo,2527200,2533440,let's do a little bit of a tour we got  some of the classics the bread the salad  the tahini and then here this is what  they just poured out this is the
u-PgumHXWVo,2533440,2538720,malachaya i think i'm saying it right  maybe i need to put in some more but  i'll work on that later here this is
u-PgumHXWVo,2538720,2544640,what i'm going to start with right here  this is hoof soup start by chopping down  cow hooves and ankles into smaller
u-PgumHXWVo,2544640,2550720,pieces those are boiled and added to a  clay pot where they're soaked in a beef  broth and cooked with allspice nutmeg
u-PgumHXWVo,2550720,2556560,cardamom cinnamon ginger and cloves it  just goes really with the theme for  today which has been really super rich
u-PgumHXWVo,2556560,2562480,foods come take a look these are all the  little bits and do dads that hold the  legs together and make it move oh gosh
u-PgumHXWVo,2562480,2570000,look at that that's just a piece of  tendon oh this is one of my favorite  things to eat in vietnam we'll see how  it compares here
u-PgumHXWVo,2571119,2576160,very rich that's like the word of the  day it's like i don't even need  chapstick now it has oiled up my lips oh
u-PgumHXWVo,2576160,2584640,let me get some of that broth it looks  like something exxon would be  responsible for  oh it's so just greasy but i love it
u-PgumHXWVo,2584640,2589680,here we have the green one that we  talked about already we saw it almost  scolded me and went into my eyeballs
u-PgumHXWVo,2589680,2594960,earlier i'm not going to try that yet  because it's meant to be tried with this  this is tomato on top of rice it's
u-PgumHXWVo,2594960,2602240,almost like a chunky marinara this white  rice is supposed to mix with the green  stuff here let's see how this goes  because this is borderline schweime it
u-PgumHXWVo,2602240,2608079,looks like shrek's toilet  so we've got our rice a little tomato a
u-PgumHXWVo,2608079,2614240,little of the malachi i just like saying  it makes me feel like i know arabic try  it out
u-PgumHXWVo,2615119,2621599,that's really good it reminds me a lot  of spinach like if you've got spinach  that's been seared in oil until it's  really like broken down and become kind
u-PgumHXWVo,2621599,2627760,of greasy because if you look at the top  of this that's just pure oil i know  you're thinking oh so like olive oil no
u-PgumHXWVo,2627760,2633280,it's just cooking oil the one vegetable  i've seen all day it is just full of oil  it is delicious it has a very unique
u-PgumHXWVo,2633280,2639200,super savory spinachy type taste to it  but man that is heavy
u-PgumHXWVo,2639200,2644800,i think i might explode if i take one  more bite of anything i can tell that  people here in egypt at least in cairo
u-PgumHXWVo,2644800,2650800,they love heavy food and they love their  meat tons of mutton tons of beef there's  chicken out there too but we didn't have
u-PgumHXWVo,2650800,2657040,that today otherwise that is a pretty  successful day too i can't complain we  went to six places and honestly no
u-PgumHXWVo,2657040,2663839,police how's it possible maybe we're  gonna get through this series after all  fingers crossed let's see
u-PgumHXWVo,2664160,2670000,after being in cairo for two days my god  and after being stopped by multiple  police who asked us to delete our
u-PgumHXWVo,2670000,2676720,footage i think it's time to leave  but i'm not leaving agent oh no
u-PgumHXWVo,2676720,2683040,we're jumping in a van leaving cairo and  driving to one of this country's most  out of this world sites sheesh we've
u-PgumHXWVo,2683040,2689119,almost literally effing run over about  five times now when you're here you need  to watch your back and your friends back
u-PgumHXWVo,2689119,2695280,today i'm on a mission to buy and cook  an entire camel are people eating this  yes
u-PgumHXWVo,2695280,2701359,it sounds straightforward  but more threats of police at any moment  police could stop us and literal threats
u-PgumHXWVo,2701359,2706960,from our own local producer make this  day much more than i bargained for
u-PgumHXWVo,2706960,2713599,i know  in the end i hope to experience one of  egypt's most unique delicacies has he
u-PgumHXWVo,2713599,2718520,cooked this before oh
u-PgumHXWVo,2720910,2725869,[Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2726800,2733920,still  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2733920,2740319,20 miles northwest of cairo about a one  hour drive will bring you to a small  village just on the edge of the delta's
u-PgumHXWVo,2740319,2747839,cultivated land  but gosh home of egypt's most grand  camel market
u-PgumHXWVo,2748319,2753359,fridays are the best days full of action  camels proudly displayed and plenty of
u-PgumHXWVo,2753359,2759880,commerce and all that ends by 11am so we  better hurry up
u-PgumHXWVo,2760720,2769200,before arriving our local producer tells  us to proceed with caution so as to not  create suspicion among the local police
u-PgumHXWVo,2769200,2775839,a quick word about our local producer  his name is ahmed siddique he was hired  solely for the purpose of preparing and
u-PgumHXWVo,2775839,2782400,executing our egypt production in all my  years of hiring producers and doing this  show i've never come across someone
u-PgumHXWVo,2782400,2789200,who's more incompetent he's conniving  and paranoid so when he says we have to  be careful for police i have no choice
u-PgumHXWVo,2789200,2795440,but to be paranoid too  all right we are heading into the camel  market right now there are camels
u-PgumHXWVo,2795440,2802960,everywhere  we're trying to keep a low profile so  yeah of course  we have my mic we're gonna head
u-PgumHXWVo,2806150,2813329,[Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2814960,2820160,men smoke shisha some drink tea and some  are taking a break after a day of
u-PgumHXWVo,2820160,2828520,brokering undulates  this is a rare moment of peace in a  place that's made up of pure chaos
u-PgumHXWVo,2830660,2833780,[Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2837200,2843359,i suggest leaving your kids at home for  this one prakash camel market if you  don't keep your head on a swivel you
u-PgumHXWVo,2843359,2848880,will get trampled  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2848880,2854559,cash has been trading hands for camels  for over 700 years on this very ground
u-PgumHXWVo,2854559,2860160,generation after generation families all  the way from sudan ethiopia and somalia
u-PgumHXWVo,2860160,2864760,brought their best in show here
u-PgumHXWVo,2873760,2879359,right now we're in the camel market i  feel like i've traveled back in time 100  years maybe a thousand years it is wild
u-PgumHXWVo,2879359,2885040,here it's pure chaos there's loads of  camels people they're shuffling them  around sometimes they're beating them
u-PgumHXWVo,2885040,2892000,with sticks to get them to move it's  nothing like i've ever seen before our  ultimate mission here is to go buy a  camel so we're headed to a vendor right
u-PgumHXWVo,2892000,2897680,now who is going to provide us with the  camel we're going to negotiate i've  heard the price of something like 1 500
u-PgumHXWVo,2897680,2903680,so we're gonna go we're gonna try to get  a camel and then see how much of the  market we can explore before we  absolutely have to get out of here now
u-PgumHXWVo,2903680,2916519,you guys know what's going on let's go  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2919180,2923079,[Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2936430,2950199,[Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,2952240,2958240,in spite of the pandemonium no authority  figures seem to really care that we're  here i was the steady camera maybe ahmed
u-PgumHXWVo,2958240,2964480,was paranoid  or maybe we're just lucky so far it's  not working out
u-PgumHXWVo,2964480,2971119,camels are grouped according to who they  belong to the guy who looks like he owns  them probably does there are about 2 000
u-PgumHXWVo,2971119,2977599,camels brought and sold here every week  they're marked with arabic words so the  gucci camels don't get mixed up with the
u-PgumHXWVo,2977599,2985119,carhartts  traded for cash or other livestock
u-PgumHXWVo,2985119,2990400,these desert dwellers will be used for  farming riding and for food
u-PgumHXWVo,2990400,2996319,are people eating this yes you eat the  big one  how much is this
u-PgumHXWVo,2996319,3001359,so two to three thousand dollars for an  entire camel plus the camel here
u-PgumHXWVo,3001359,3007040,wow  to demonstrate the health of their  camels merchants cut them loose
u-PgumHXWVo,3007040,3012800,the result spontaneous stampedes by  creatures that can weigh over 900 pounds
u-PgumHXWVo,3012800,3019280,following close behind in hot pursuit  the merchant with their whacking stick  shoots attempting to subdue the animal
u-PgumHXWVo,3019280,3025200,once more all right so this is what you  see all over this place there's camels  running around freely and then there's  people trying to corral them by beating
u-PgumHXWVo,3025200,3031760,them with a stick they grab them by the  lip and then when they have them kind of  subdued they're able to pull the leg  back tie it up and then that restricts
u-PgumHXWVo,3031760,3037280,their movement enough so that they don't  run away everywhere so that's why this  place is chaotic
u-PgumHXWVo,3037280,3044199,now that i know the lay of the land it's  time to do some shopping of my own  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,3045760,3051119,it takes years of experience to know  which camels are worthy of your  investment skilled buyers focus on their
u-PgumHXWVo,3051119,3056319,feet teeth eyes skin and hair color  if you're as naive as me oh there's some
u-PgumHXWVo,3056319,3062240,really young ones back here you'll leave  it up to your local producer to  negotiate  when he comes back with a price tag of
u-PgumHXWVo,3062240,3068480,fourteen hundred dollars you just hope  you're not being ripped off  we have to buy one of these camels i'm
u-PgumHXWVo,3068480,3075119,told that this is the one you're just a  year or two old to be fair i didn't  choose a camel it was chosen for me  relatively pretty soon we're gonna load
u-PgumHXWVo,3075119,3081119,it up we're gonna put it in the back of  a truck well i have no idea how this  works all right that's how you do camel  shopping in egypt uh first for me it's a
u-PgumHXWVo,3081119,3087010,lot different than whole foods i'll tell  you that  [Applause]
u-PgumHXWVo,3087010,3090139,[Music]

u-PgumHXWVo,3098400,3104800,like the pyramids camels are a point of  pride  though that's not always clearly  demonstrated the handlers even show a
u-PgumHXWVo,3104800,3110720,little respect for the sacred animal  reciting bismillah before shoving their
u-PgumHXWVo,3110720,3118159,full weight into the hapless creature  [Applause]  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,3121200,3127200,i wish this was the end of my  transaction but instead it's the start  of a new problem
u-PgumHXWVo,3127200,3134000,ahmed our local producer has failed to  properly negotiate with the locals now  he's quite literally being chased down
u-PgumHXWVo,3134000,3139520,liz do you know what's going on  everyone now that we're ready to go some
u-PgumHXWVo,3139520,3145359,folks don't want us to leave until they  get a little something for themselves so  right now we have our camel we're trying
u-PgumHXWVo,3145359,3151599,to leave they won't let us leave they're  chasing down our local producer  everybody wants money everyone wants to  get paid that's how it is everywhere
u-PgumHXWVo,3151599,3159279,it's all smiles in the beginning until  you leave  there's always something else
u-PgumHXWVo,3159680,3165839,ahmed circles to the back of the truck  where cameraman kai and i are already  rolling in his flustered state ahmed
u-PgumHXWVo,3165839,3172000,turns his attention from the crowd to  the camera then to me yesterday
u-PgumHXWVo,3172000,3176440,if you don't include something that you  haven't done
u-PgumHXWVo,3184000,3190480,if you couldn't hear that clearly after  walking into my shot ahmed warns me that  if he appears on camera there will be a
u-PgumHXWVo,3190480,3197119,price to pay and that he doesn't mean a  financial price  very nice
u-PgumHXWVo,3197920,3203680,when you're in a new chaotic and  near-lawless country generally it'd be  the local producers job to create a
u-PgumHXWVo,3203680,3208800,sense of security if you lose that too  then you're on your own this is not how
u-PgumHXWVo,3208800,3215920,a production is supposed to go all i  care about now is getting my team out of  this market in one piece
u-PgumHXWVo,3216240,3221440,we have our camel now this is a narrow  escape  this is the camel market of egypt a once
u-PgumHXWVo,3221440,3226800,in a lifetime experience and once in a  lifetime because  i will never come back here again holy
u-PgumHXWVo,3226800,3232720,cow  no no no no all right even this guy this  guy right now he's asking for money he's
u-PgumHXWVo,3232720,3238079,asking for money from me this is kind of  how it works here it always starts with  smiles and it ends with a handout
u-PgumHXWVo,3238079,3243200,sometimes chasing sometimes a little bit  of intimidation  i have the camera it's definitely time
u-PgumHXWVo,3243200,3246280,to leave
u-PgumHXWVo,3251600,3258679,[Applause]  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,3258880,3261880,oh
u-PgumHXWVo,3264000,3269040,the camel is on the way to its final  destination that's about four hours away  we're in the van we're going there too
u-PgumHXWVo,3269040,3276480,in the meantime we stopped here at a  camel restaurant it's a restaurant and a  butchery let's take a look at what's  going on here
u-PgumHXWVo,3277119,3283920,first of all all this camel parts if you  look inside here there's liver meat it's  part of the trachea or a heart beyond
u-PgumHXWVo,3283920,3290160,that when you come here can anybody  guess what this is  oh i like it they're gonna unwrap it i  hope they don't think i'm gonna buy it i
u-PgumHXWVo,3290160,3296400,just bought a whole camel for a lot of  money wow  this is a whole camel leg right here and
u-PgumHXWVo,3296400,3301680,a tail so i'm gonna guess this uh back  leg so this is the raw meat i'm gonna  see if they can cook something up
u-PgumHXWVo,3301680,3308240,something like camel liver camel liver  is a pretty common breakfast and treat  in this area so i'm going to see if i  can get that
u-PgumHXWVo,3308240,3313920,the camel liver is sliced into  bite-sized chunks then it's stir-fried  with olive oil chopped green chilies and
u-PgumHXWVo,3313920,3320480,tomato then season with a seven-spice  blend including pepper cumin and  cardamom this is great it looks
u-PgumHXWVo,3320480,3325520,incredible here is a bread this is what  you eat it with i've had camel but i've  never had camo liver cut it nice and
u-PgumHXWVo,3325520,3330880,thin and it looks quite tender i'm gonna  try it just plain to begin with
u-PgumHXWVo,3331280,3336400,oh delicious the seasonings they put on  there it's super savory a little bit  spicy there's some chilies in here what
u-PgumHXWVo,3336400,3341520,stands out most to me is the texture the  texture of liver can usually be kind of  like almost mushy it can like make your
u-PgumHXWVo,3341520,3347680,mouth dry while you're eating it but  here it's really snappy so i'm gonna  break some of the bread off i'm gonna  grab some pieces and that looks real
u-PgumHXWVo,3347680,3353280,nice  really unique texture this is  fascinating because you know my camel  they can go months without drinking
u-PgumHXWVo,3353280,3359100,water i mean i do believe the liver is  part of that as well as their hump  they've got nice humps
u-PgumHXWVo,3359100,3370730,[Applause]  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,3371440,3378319,egypt is predominantly desert seriously  like 96  most of it looks like this infertile
u-PgumHXWVo,3378319,3385440,sandy dry  not surprisingly all the life in egypt  human and otherwise springs up near
u-PgumHXWVo,3385440,3392240,water especially around the nile river  but dotted throughout the land you can  find these
u-PgumHXWVo,3392960,3398079,welcome to the oasis a fertile spot  within a vast wasteland

u-PgumHXWVo,3418480,3424000,but these steps must go on we must  proceed the next steps we've come to a  small community the plan is to prepare
u-PgumHXWVo,3424000,3429040,the camel tonight marinate it let it sit  and then tomorrow it's going to be  cooked and many people from the
u-PgumHXWVo,3429040,3434078,community will enjoy together but the  first step is to slaughter it
u-PgumHXWVo,3441200,3447920,an arabic word that means the people of  the oasis here the majority are muslim  that means the slaughter must be carried
u-PgumHXWVo,3447920,3455040,out in the appropriate ritual manner  the animal must be alive healthy and
u-PgumHXWVo,3455040,3462000,well fed until the time comes  after invoking the name of god
u-PgumHXWVo,3462000,3466880,there's one quick cut  and then we wait
u-PgumHXWVo,3470960,3476720,this platform you're watching now  centers videos based on western norms  only but around the world a site like
u-PgumHXWVo,3476720,3483359,this is not shocking nor sensational  it's a part of life that at least in  this culture no one is too young to
u-PgumHXWVo,3483359,3489760,witness  [Music]  while we're in the presence of here  right now is real men and they are
u-PgumHXWVo,3489760,3495040,making quick work on this camel it is  freezing out here you can see my breath
u-PgumHXWVo,3495040,3500559,see what i'm saying after slaughtering  it they skin it to hang it up and they  kind of debone it they go joint by joint
u-PgumHXWVo,3500559,3506960,they're getting all the muscle off in as  big of pieces as possible and they're  putting that in these buckets over here  to the side and then that is what's
u-PgumHXWVo,3506960,3514160,going to be cooked tomorrow right now it  is  8 18. i'll say it's 10 p.m so people  think i'm tough too right now it's
u-PgumHXWVo,3514160,3521200,10 p.m  very late but it's worth it we're gonna  stay up late to make sure this gets done  properly
u-PgumHXWVo,3524400,3529599,marinated with olive oil cumin coriander  garlic cayenne salt and pepper soon this
u-PgumHXWVo,3529599,3536160,camel meat will be made into mandi an  ancient style of underground cooking  prepared by the biduans a nomadic desert
u-PgumHXWVo,3536160,3540760,people who span across many countries
u-PgumHXWVo,3541270,3547680,[Music]  day two with our camel prepared and
u-PgumHXWVo,3547680,3552720,ready to cook we're heading out of the  oasis and 110 miles southwest into the
u-PgumHXWVo,3552720,3559599,white desert far from civilization far  from modern conveniences but also far  from modern inconveniences like the
u-PgumHXWVo,3559599,3566640,egyptian police  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,3566640,3572079,here just beyond these mountains we're  headed to a place where we're going to  be cooking all that camel from yesterday
u-PgumHXWVo,3572079,3580599,here in the desert so i'm excited it's  going to be a good day we have a lot of  food and a lot to see let's get going
u-PgumHXWVo,3581200,3590409,[Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,3590720,3597520,upon arriving to our tented desert camp  instead of meeting bedouin people we're  introduced to local tour guides who we
u-PgumHXWVo,3597520,3603839,abruptly find out have never taken on a  cooking challenge like this before now  we'll see local tour guides who have
u-PgumHXWVo,3603839,3608960,never cooked anything more than chicken  attempt to cook an entire camel
u-PgumHXWVo,3608960,3616079,this is gonna be interesting  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,3616079,3622559,mandy is a barbecue style meal very  popular in the arab world in maundy the  meat must be arranged on a rack and slow
u-PgumHXWVo,3622559,3629599,cooked underground here's how they do it  they've already dug two holes and buried  steel barrels in the ground load those
u-PgumHXWVo,3629599,3636160,holes with fiery wood until they burn  down to embers  he has all the meat from last night it's
u-PgumHXWVo,3636160,3642240,been marinating and he's putting it on  this grill this apparatus that's gonna  soon descend into a barrel and get
u-PgumHXWVo,3642240,3647520,cooked from below with a bunch of  cinders cinders embers you know what i  mean the way they slaughter the camel is
u-PgumHXWVo,3647520,3652799,really quite unique because they've  almost like just de-boned it and taken  off the biggest chunks of meat possible
u-PgumHXWVo,3652799,3659440,so it's not like little bitty sirloins  or steaks like these are big chunks of  meat going on here
u-PgumHXWVo,3660079,3667040,all right this is a big moment we've  been waiting for the gentlemen have all  the meat stacked up here this has got to  be something like 40 pounds 45 pounds of
u-PgumHXWVo,3667040,3672480,meat just huge camel chunks we're  bringing it to a barrel  this is the most important part it's
u-PgumHXWVo,3672480,3678240,gonna go descend into the pit these arms  are gonna catch the sides so it's not  touching the fire all the meat will
u-PgumHXWVo,3678240,3683359,essentially cook and steam inside  okay the blanket goes on trapping in
u-PgumHXWVo,3683359,3689200,even more of the heat  and it's almost like they're going to  seal it around the edges using the water
u-PgumHXWVo,3689200,3694559,so now they take the sand they bury it  they go around the periphery in the end  the goal here is to make it really
u-PgumHXWVo,3694559,3700799,sealed in there we want the heat to stay  in there long enough for all that meat  to cook through it's a lot of meat  there's something like 40 45 pounds of
u-PgumHXWVo,3700799,3707680,meat that's gonna have to cook before  they remove it in a couple of hours  while the main course cooks other dishes
u-PgumHXWVo,3707680,3713040,are being prepared  rice egyptian bread salad stewed
u-PgumHXWVo,3713040,3719520,vegetables and braised camel heart oh  yes take a look at that big beautiful  chunks of camel heart just bubbling away
u-PgumHXWVo,3719520,3724640,in the pressure cooker camel hearts have  to be huge animals are so tall they have  to pump blood all the way to the top of
u-PgumHXWVo,3724640,3729680,their freaking head which is also very  tall i'm gonna try it right now  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,3729680,3735359,whoa good yeah all the organs of the  camel tastes a little bit different the  heart tastes like liver it's very livery
u-PgumHXWVo,3735359,3741839,it has a beautiful texture it's kind of  softened up it's just got that beautiful  dense meat oh it's so satisfying it's
u-PgumHXWVo,3741839,3748079,very nice it's interesting because out  here as soon as you get in the shade  it's very cool so it's not that hot it's  just that you get baked by the sun so
u-PgumHXWVo,3748079,3753440,being under here having some nice warm  bubbling hot heart is quite satisfying  love it
u-PgumHXWVo,3753440,3760079,back to the meat pits three hours has  elapsed all right the moment has finally  come there's no thermometer there's no
u-PgumHXWVo,3760079,3765599,way to like check it and put it back in  there's no way to pop open the oven door  here we just have to dig it up we got
u-PgumHXWVo,3765599,3772720,one shot if it's still raw  it's ruined  [Music]  under this sand is our dinner
u-PgumHXWVo,3772720,3777760,has this team pulled it off oh you can  see the steam billowing out from the  hole will the meat be cooked through all
u-PgumHXWVo,3777760,3784960,that remains is the lid to be popped off  and we're gonna see the meat  we're about to find out
u-PgumHXWVo,3788079,3793440,oh my gosh  the meat looks completely different from  before you can see it's really cooked
u-PgumHXWVo,3793440,3799680,down from the heat oh yes this looks  incredible the next move put it on the  platter this was once the lid and then
u-PgumHXWVo,3799680,3807039,now this is where the meat is going to  sit did i pull some off  wait really  the meat has become so soft the fat is
u-PgumHXWVo,3807039,3813200,tender juicy and rendered down look at  that slow cooked beautiful steamed smoky
u-PgumHXWVo,3813200,3820799,you take some you take some i'll take  some cheers  oh man that is awesome all right please
u-PgumHXWVo,3820799,3827520,they'll continue their backs are  breaking that is awesome fatty tender  smoky delicious juicy camel meat

u-PgumHXWVo,3833680,3840788,wow  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,3845440,3852079,gentlemen thank you so much for this  opportunity it's a pleasure to be here  hanging out with you you are with thank  you this is great so first of all the
u-PgumHXWVo,3852079,3857200,camel looks amazing  this is an incredible meal we have all
u-PgumHXWVo,3857200,3864400,the camel here how do we start in  bahrain is first we can eat vegetables  and salad and after we can eat it rice
u-PgumHXWVo,3864400,3870880,with the meat oh  literally taking all of my willpower to  not dig into the meat that's right in
u-PgumHXWVo,3870880,3877390,front of me  it's like a delicious coleslaw oh so  this is potatoes some other vegetables  in here oh and there's some zucchini
u-PgumHXWVo,3877390,3884079,[Music]  it's steamed it's got salt it's got  tomatoes to add a little bit of acid  it's really good
u-PgumHXWVo,3884079,3889520,which one you choose to eat from here oh  i can pick let's go with this one
u-PgumHXWVo,3889520,3895119,oh no knife or anything we really  ripping apart this meat just this one  big chunk of meat is probably enough for
u-PgumHXWVo,3895119,3903039,all of us to eat this is incredible  there's fatty bits there's protein all  of it's getting mixed with the rice that  looks gorgeous try it out
u-PgumHXWVo,3905039,3911039,oh delicious incredible i've had  campbell before but never like this man  the taste is so delightfully smoky and
u-PgumHXWVo,3911039,3916799,there's some subtle spices it's such a  unique kind of meat would you compare  camel to beef to goat to sheep no this
u-PgumHXWVo,3916799,3922559,is different different from everything  yeah yeah i agree it's hard to pinpoint  it the texture is kind of like beef but
u-PgumHXWVo,3922559,3928799,it doesn't taste beefy  i'm amazed like every bite is a little  bit different and i love that since
u-PgumHXWVo,3928799,3935200,they're cooking in these huge chunks of  meat it really retains a lot of its  moisture i mean this is like one whole
u-PgumHXWVo,3935200,3940960,big chunk of camel i don't know which  part this is from here the shoulder  really yeah you know so i think that's
u-PgumHXWVo,3940960,3947280,the key to this unique style of cooking  it's like keeping it all in one piece  like this so that when you steam it for  a long time inside you've got something
u-PgumHXWVo,3947280,3952960,that looks incredibly juicy  oh yeah  so you guys usually do chicken you do
u-PgumHXWVo,3952960,3960160,smaller animals today you took on a  whole camel that's outrageous that's  wild
u-PgumHXWVo,3960160,3965839,i thought leaving cairo would be the  perfect way to put our problems behind  us in the end i was introduced to a
u-PgumHXWVo,3965839,3973280,whole list of new ones  but i'll take local squabbles over  police interactions any day i'm thinking
u-PgumHXWVo,3973280,3979920,as long as we're in egypt it's probably  best to stay in the countryside far from  police gentlemen i want to say thank you
u-PgumHXWVo,3979920,3985119,again  this is a great experience for me i can  see why people like coming out here i
u-PgumHXWVo,3985119,3992240,mean places like cairo it's busy it's  loud it's noisy it's chaotic and i like  that too but sometimes you need a break
u-PgumHXWVo,3992240,3997520,and then here it's completely peaceful  and there's something really interesting  like when everyone's quiet it's real
u-PgumHXWVo,3997520,4007950,silence  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,4007950,4011570,[Applause]
u-PgumHXWVo,4013440,4019280,leaving the bustling cityscape of cairo  and heading into the desert with one of  the best choices i've ever made this is
u-PgumHXWVo,4019280,4025119,a place in arabic i can't pronounce it  but in english it means difficult place  a name that could be used for all of
u-PgumHXWVo,4025119,4030799,egypt  leaving the country would be even better  but that will come soon we still have
u-PgumHXWVo,4030799,4037039,one more day here can you  like write it guys you don't have to  learn other languages you just
u-PgumHXWVo,4037039,4042799,figure it out  today i'm joining a couple villagers so  i can walk a day in their shoes this is
u-PgumHXWVo,4042799,4048559,something they do often here i want to  see how they live and of course how they  eat i have no idea what that is this is
u-PgumHXWVo,4048559,4054240,my last chance to squeeze some good  moments out of egypt sounds good yeah it  all starts
u-PgumHXWVo,4054240,4061119,here today is our fourth day shooting  here in egypt what we figured out so far  is a place to shoot is actually not
u-PgumHXWVo,4061119,4066240,cairo even though we have proper permits  even though the press office of egypt  has said it's okay for us to shoot
u-PgumHXWVo,4066240,4071520,almost every time we've come up against  the authorities or police they have  tried to either stop us or make us
u-PgumHXWVo,4071520,4077920,delete our footage so we're trying to be  extra careful that's why we're here this  is an oasis
u-PgumHXWVo,4077920,4083599,a place in the middle of the desert  about a five hour drive from cairo that  has so many different natural water
u-PgumHXWVo,4083599,4089039,springs that a huge population is able  to survive out here today we're spending  the entire day with an egyptian farmer
u-PgumHXWVo,4089039,4094400,we're gonna see how he lives what he  eats and hopefully no police
u-PgumHXWVo,4094400,4102080,we'll see  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,4102080,4107679,we are here we're inside the farm this  is one of his compounds a place where he  cooks and hangs out during the day this

u-PgumHXWVo,4112719,4119520,meet amen a villager who's dedicated his  life to the sun wind and sands of the  desert this is fantastic i'm so excited
u-PgumHXWVo,4119520,4125278,to be here because we're going to see a  very unique way of life and it starts  here with his breakfast
u-PgumHXWVo,4125278,4130318,render down lamb fat in a blazing hot  wood fire then add tomato
u-PgumHXWVo,4130318,4137920,then green bell pepper season with salt  pepper cumin and cook until the sauce  forms that is dish one in a second dish
u-PgumHXWVo,4137920,4143359,he has the same vegetables but he adds  one ingredient i've never seen before  come take a look this round shaped
u-PgumHXWVo,4143359,4149440,biscuit is called kishk an egyptian  ethnic food that's been eaten for  thousands of years this is super hard
u-PgumHXWVo,4149440,4155020,it's basically a fermented wheat milk  mixture that's been sun dried until it's  dehydrated and hard
u-PgumHXWVo,4155020,4160400,[Music]  it's so interesting it's super hard
u-PgumHXWVo,4160400,4165520,grainy but it has a cheesy taste to it  too have you ever left cheddar cheese  out on the counter for too long and it's
u-PgumHXWVo,4165520,4171758,dried out a little bit but you ate it  anyways because you're an animal like me  it tastes a little bit like that and so  of course he doesn't eat it like this he
u-PgumHXWVo,4171758,4178080,mixes it in with these other vegetables  it's going to kind of rehydrate it bring  it back to life and we're going to see  what that tastes like pretty soon i'm
u-PgumHXWVo,4178080,4183120,excited  break the kishk into smaller chunks  then cook with tomato and green bell
u-PgumHXWVo,4183120,4189838,pepper  season with salt pepper sugar and cumin  now a third dish is being prepared by
u-PgumHXWVo,4189838,4195840,ibrahim i am here with ibrahim he's also  making some breakfast too this is fool  oh he wants to feed me already all right
u-PgumHXWVo,4195840,4202320,thank you  oh that's good yeah  tasty that's this is what we saw i think
u-PgumHXWVo,4202320,4209040,one of the first places we went to in  cairo what's interesting is when you  start having the same type of food in  different places or regions everyone can
u-PgumHXWVo,4209040,4215440,make it a little bit differently the one  we had was more of a paste with kind of  crushed up mashed fava beans and this is
u-PgumHXWVo,4215440,4221040,kind of a combination it's got the fava  bean paste with whole beans in there too  there's tomato there's green bell pepper
u-PgumHXWVo,4221040,4227040,and there's spices i think i like this  style more  good morning
u-PgumHXWVo,4228560,4235520,this looks incredible this is just  breakfast and it's so many different  items this is called sun bread i'm told  this bread is kind of cooked half in the
u-PgumHXWVo,4235520,4240560,sun and half in the oven just like with  the egyptian bread they use that as the  utensil
u-PgumHXWVo,4240560,4246239,i'm gonna start with  that how do you say deliciousness
u-PgumHXWVo,4246239,4252800,i'm going to work my way up to the kish  but this one is  the mountain
u-PgumHXWVo,4253440,4258800,that's outstanding it's like the world's  best marinara sauce the sun bread is  awesome it's like half stale half crispy
u-PgumHXWVo,4258800,4265600,but it's the perfect vehicle for all  these foods what's your favorite thing  here  all the gifts from god are good good
u-PgumHXWVo,4265600,4271360,answer  this is the one i've been wanting to try  the kisk it tastes a little bit cheesy  when i had it it's raw form let's try it
u-PgumHXWVo,4271360,4277679,out now  [Music]  oh that's awesome this is so good i try
u-PgumHXWVo,4277679,4283679,to put my finger on it though i mean it  has the tomato some fresh vegetables  oh god how do you explain that the
u-PgumHXWVo,4283679,4290320,texture is like a coarse oatmeal but the  flavor is just something completely  unique there's some acid from the tomato  and then a lot of richness from the milk
u-PgumHXWVo,4290320,4298000,in that bread it's confusing but it's  really good  is this a normal breakfast is this how  you'd usually start out your day
u-PgumHXWVo,4298560,4304400,so i noticed there's no meat here do you  have a meal where you usually eat meat  lunch
u-PgumHXWVo,4304400,4310560,which animals do you eat  the sheep how often are you eating the  sheep
u-PgumHXWVo,4310560,4317440,quite often because we prefer to eat our  own food we don't want to get from  anywhere else
u-PgumHXWVo,4317440,4323520,far from modern conveniences or really  modern anything  life out here is all about
u-PgumHXWVo,4323520,4329199,self-sufficiency so farming and raising  cattle are essential traits for farmers  out here what is the most lucrative
u-PgumHXWVo,4329199,4334800,endeavor  he said both the balance is important
u-PgumHXWVo,4334800,4342080,otherwise this imbalance will force you  to need things from other places and so  on
u-PgumHXWVo,4342080,4348480,these men don't actually live here their  homes are further into the village this  is a separate space for their cattle
u-PgumHXWVo,4348480,4355040,this is the farm behind me now almost  all the animals are kept within these  brick walls let's go inside and check it
u-PgumHXWVo,4355040,4360800,out  [Music]  first what we see the cows why i want to
u-PgumHXWVo,4360800,4366800,pet you  they don't want to be pet it turns out  cows are used for agricultural work like
u-PgumHXWVo,4366800,4372960,tilling irrigating and carting oh no we  have a situation they also provide the  usual meat and milk i may have to give
u-PgumHXWVo,4372960,4380719,up on this whole petting thing it  doesn't look like it's working out and  their waste helps to fertilize this  already stubborn sandy soil unruly bowl
u-PgumHXWVo,4380719,4386080,is it a bowl hold on let me look  underneath  it's a bull horses and donkeys carry
u-PgumHXWVo,4386080,4391600,freight goods or supplies one of my  favorites  donkeys actually you'll still see them
u-PgumHXWVo,4391600,4399520,being used in the streets of cairo one  of africa's biggest cities  can you  like right in
u-PgumHXWVo,4401440,4406640,that's incredible  wait me  uh
u-PgumHXWVo,4406640,4411679,[Music]  i think it might be a little too heavy
u-PgumHXWVo,4411679,4417280,then there's the sheep one of the most  commonly eaten proteins in the country  fun and games are over we are heading
u-PgumHXWVo,4417280,4422960,into the sheep pen right now and our  butcher is here he's gonna do his best  to catch one
u-PgumHXWVo,4422960,4429280,oh my gosh he made quick work of that  i was told earlier they're eating about  one sheep every two weeks that's like 25
u-PgumHXWVo,4429280,4434719,a year that's a lot  he's taking the lamb to the slaughter  point now and then
u-PgumHXWVo,4434719,4441440,you guys know what happens next  here in this muslim majority country it  is the belief of those following islam
u-PgumHXWVo,4441440,4447370,that all living creatures were made by  their god  [Music]
u-PgumHXWVo,4448239,4454440,animals exist for the benefit of human  beings and they must be treated with  kindness and compassion
u-PgumHXWVo,4454440,4459760,[Music]  when it comes to taking an animal's life
u-PgumHXWVo,4459760,4466719,for the purpose of sustaining your own  the slaughter must be carried out in the  appropriate ritual manner the name of
u-PgumHXWVo,4466719,4475440,god is invoked in order to emphasize the  sanctity of life and that the animal is  being killed for food with god's consent
u-PgumHXWVo,4475440,4480480,after all its blood drains it's time for  butchering
u-PgumHXWVo,4480480,4486640,here aside from the blood which is never  eaten nothing else goes to waste  this skin is skillfully peeled off and
u-PgumHXWVo,4486640,4494679,will later be used for leather  production the organs and meat will soon  be cooked up into several dishes
u-PgumHXWVo,4496239,4503520,dish one the grilled lamb meat the meat  is chopped down to small chunks ribs  tenderloin sirloin shoulder front and
u-PgumHXWVo,4503520,4510400,hind quarters all of it together  marinated with onion salt lemon and  black pepper that gets grilled on an
u-PgumHXWVo,4510400,4514640,open fire i'm here with ibrahimovic
u-PgumHXWVo,4515520,4523090,we're making a few different dishes out  of this sheep it's going first on this  crowd oh yes up in there
u-PgumHXWVo,4523090,4530320,[Music]  the cooking style here is a balance  between speed and flavor it's practical
u-PgumHXWVo,4530320,4535920,efficient and these cooking methods can  be done pretty much anywhere  at the same time it's given just enough
u-PgumHXWVo,4535920,4541760,love with seasonings and spices so it  tastes great too that's really good  really delicious crisped up a little bit
u-PgumHXWVo,4541760,4548400,almost dried out just on the edges home  once you kind of crunch through the  surface area it's all super juicy inside
u-PgumHXWVo,4548400,4553840,the main course has just started and  this is something special
u-PgumHXWVo,4554320,4560880,a dish made of rice and meat well known  in arab cuisine but each country makes  it a little bit differently this is how
u-PgumHXWVo,4560880,4567280,they do it here  [Applause]  they boil meat in a big pot along with
u-PgumHXWVo,4567280,4573600,tomato and green bell pepper then season  with salt and black pepper and let it  simmer for an hour right now we're
u-PgumHXWVo,4573600,4581040,making our main dish this is called  kapsa smells good yeah now he's gonna  put in the rice please
u-PgumHXWVo,4581040,4587520,it's got kind of like an orangey broth i  think from the meat itself plus the  spices together the tomato the onion the
u-PgumHXWVo,4587520,4593040,rice is gonna be flavored and then as  you're eating it there's gonna be big  chunks of meat inside wait how long
u-PgumHXWVo,4593040,4599119,fifteen or something about 20 minutes  and that's gonna be ready  thank you
u-PgumHXWVo,4600080,4607120,while waiting for the capsad to be  cooked ibrahim brings me to his fields  for a surprise so this here is the power
u-PgumHXWVo,4607120,4609840,of the oasis
u-PgumHXWVo,4612159,4617520,a huge vegetable garden of ibrahim here  he's growing all types of plants he's  going to show me some of his giant
u-PgumHXWVo,4617520,4624320,vegetables despite the arid climate  farming isn't impossible in the oasis as  long as you have water here in ibrahim's
u-PgumHXWVo,4624320,4630400,field he's growing tomatoes onions and  these  oh take a look at this
u-PgumHXWVo,4630400,4638239,that is crazy  look at this this is a giant turnip he  fed us the ooze from tmnt2 he's gonna
u-PgumHXWVo,4638239,4643360,pick one of these and we're gonna have  this with our dinner it's crazy because  it's already almost out of the ground
u-PgumHXWVo,4643360,4648840,what  i've seen turnips maybe this size this  is 10 times bigger than anything i've  seen
u-PgumHXWVo,4648840,4654239,before this one's even bigger  okay that is the record breaker right
u-PgumHXWVo,4654239,4660719,there  that's legit 20 pound turn up here
u-PgumHXWVo,4660719,4665760,freaking huge so we have our veggies i  think we have to get back to the meat  and hopefully
u-PgumHXWVo,4665760,4669039,we can incorporate this too
u-PgumHXWVo,4672960,4680158,this is an incredible spread we have  here the culmination of many people's  effort coming together in one big meal
u-PgumHXWVo,4680480,4685600,all right i love these guys usually when  we do a scene with people it's like no  you can need to be natural everyone here
u-PgumHXWVo,4685600,4691040,is looking forward to it they're taking  bites and they're not holding back at  all that's what i love to see here the
u-PgumHXWVo,4691040,4697080,world's biggest turnip they've just been  chopped into pieces here and served raw  i'm gonna try one of these
u-PgumHXWVo,4697080,4702159,[Music]  not bad it's interesting because it's  not as crisp and it is a bit woody i
u-PgumHXWVo,4702159,4708960,heard when they get really big they can  be kind of woody tasting this is the  grilled lamb we saw earlier and then  this is kapsa this beautiful blend of
u-PgumHXWVo,4708960,4715760,rice and meat together  it looks like a lamb shank this is  incredible
u-PgumHXWVo,4715970,4723280,[Music]  wow  that is delicious the lamb itself is  super tender juicy protein it's just
u-PgumHXWVo,4723280,4729440,falling off the bone you really get the  full flavor of the actual lamb mix that  with some rice
u-PgumHXWVo,4729440,4734719,the only thing you have to watch out for  is bone fragments because they  absolutely pulverized the sheep as they
u-PgumHXWVo,4734719,4743040,were kind of cutting it down to size  when is the last time you had kapsa i'm  better for this last night really
u-PgumHXWVo,4743040,4748239,and you're not sick of it no never  beautiful it's very delicious between  the grilled lamb and this kind of more
u-PgumHXWVo,4748239,4753679,boiled lamb it's like you cover all your  texture bases one is kind of smoky and  crunchy the other one's super soft and
u-PgumHXWVo,4753679,4759679,tender so you kind of get every  beautiful aspect of the lamb i want to  try this one
u-PgumHXWVo,4761040,4767120,praised organs and meat in a mixture of  onion and tomato seasoned with salt  cumin and black pepper that's too hot

u-PgumHXWVo,4820639,4826800,noticed that i don't really like it  now as my trip draws to a close
u-PgumHXWVo,4826800,4832480,i'm grasping for something positive  about this place that i can take home  with me
u-PgumHXWVo,4835600,4840719,history civilization  nature open air excellent weather and
u-PgumHXWVo,4840719,4846760,those who come to east and drink from  the nile will always
u-PgumHXWVo,4859199,4865920,egypt is mentioned several times in the  quran so in the quran god says enter  egypt in peace so it's the safest place
u-PgumHXWVo,4865920,4870638,on the planet  from another mother
u-PgumHXWVo,4871440,4877120,that was a donkey what's its name mickey  mouse  oh my god it's happening i'm easy he
u-PgumHXWVo,4877120,4882880,called me  i don't need to fall in love with every  place i go every minute we're shooting
u-PgumHXWVo,4882880,4888239,in the city we're looking over our  shoulders i don't really like it and my  point of view  even though it echoes from a large
u-PgumHXWVo,4888239,4894400,platform it's still one among millions  rolling but be less obvious people in  egypt have gone through a lot especially
u-PgumHXWVo,4894400,4900560,in the last 10 years awesome if things  are gonna indeed change for the best  it's gonna take time
u-PgumHXWVo,4900560,4906880,and when it happens or if it happens  i won't be here to see it today's gonna
u-PgumHXWVo,4906880,4912800,be brutal i have no idea what to expect  it's gonna be bittersweet it's sweet  because we're getting out of cairo and i
u-PgumHXWVo,4912800,4919679,can't wait to be literally anywhere else  but egypt but it's bitter because it is  uncertain whether we're gonna get back
u-PgumHXWVo,4919679,4926040,the roughly ten to twelve thousand  dollars worth of gear that the  government officials here thought it was  appropriate to take from me
u-PgumHXWVo,4926040,4932639,[Music]  in the end after one more hellish series  of interactions with airport authorities
u-PgumHXWVo,4932639,4939199,i'm finally giving back my hard drives  batteries lights and cameras that they  took from me on the first day in true
u-PgumHXWVo,4939199,4946400,egyptian fashion they treated me like a  criminal to the very end walking to my  gate and ensuring i didn't open any bags
u-PgumHXWVo,4946400,4951520,before entering the plane  [Music]  when the airplane wheels finally lifted  off
u-PgumHXWVo,4951520,4958760,well  that was one of the best moments hot  experience since i got here
u-PgumHXWVo,4959260,4965439,[Applause]  [Music]
