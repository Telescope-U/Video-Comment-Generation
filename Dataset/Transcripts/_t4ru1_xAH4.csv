_t4ru1_xAH4,60,4440,We’re now only around 3 months away from Apple’s September event where we’re expecting
_t4ru1_xAH4,4440,10530,"Apple to reveal their brand new 10th-generation budget iPad, and in this video, I’m gonna"
_t4ru1_xAH4,10530,15299,try to answer the question that’s on a LOT of people’s minds right now.
_t4ru1_xAH4,15300,21499,Will the new iPad 10 come with a FULL redesign just like we got with all of the other iPads
_t4ru1_xAH4,21499,27829,"like the iPad Pro, the iPad Air and the iPad mini, or will Apple choose to stick around"
_t4ru1_xAH4,27829,30829,with the old design for just another year.
_t4ru1_xAH4,30829,36250,And this is a very important question because it can and SHOULD easily make or break somebody’s
_t4ru1_xAH4,36250,42440,decision on whether to wait until this new iPad or buy something right now like the current
_t4ru1_xAH4,42440,44840,iPad 9 on sale for $309.
_t4ru1_xAH4,44840,51080,"Well, in this video, I’m gonna work through a bunch of leaks and combine that with common"
_t4ru1_xAH4,51080,57430,sense and some key points from Apple’s previous iPad lineup strategy to give you guys my own
_t4ru1_xAH4,57430,62830,personal prediction for if Apple is gonna redesign the iPad this year and what that’ll
_t4ru1_xAH4,62830,66829,"mean for the pricing and features, so let’s get started!"
_t4ru1_xAH4,66829,71380,"First of all, before I get into the exclusive new leaks from 9to5mac, I want to make the"
_t4ru1_xAH4,71380,76990,point that Apple’s budget iPad is essentially like the youngest kid in the family who receives
_t4ru1_xAH4,76990,80618,all of the hand-me-downs from older siblings.
_t4ru1_xAH4,80619,86340,"For example, the current budget iPad 9 comes with the pretty old A13 chip which first showed"
_t4ru1_xAH4,86340,89648,up in the iPhone 11 back in 2019.
_t4ru1_xAH4,89649,95929,It was also the very last iPad in the entire lineup to finally get upgraded from 32GB of
_t4ru1_xAH4,95929,103749,"base storage up to 64, and that makes sense because it’s only $329, hence why everyone"
_t4ru1_xAH4,103749,106049,calls it the budget iPad.
_t4ru1_xAH4,106049,110609,And this hand-me-down point is actually gonna be incredibly useful for this video because
_t4ru1_xAH4,110609,115259,we can take a look in the past and see how long it took for some of the main key features
_t4ru1_xAH4,115259,121549,to make it’s way from Apple’s higher-end iPads over to the budget iPad and then take
_t4ru1_xAH4,121549,125979,what we learn from that and apply it to the whole redesign debacle.
_t4ru1_xAH4,125979,131009,"And for these comparisons, I want to stick to the smaller-sized iPad Pro and iPad Air"
_t4ru1_xAH4,131009,135720,models that are the most similar to the current budget iPad.
_t4ru1_xAH4,135720,142299,"Getting started, Apple Pencil support came to the 9.7” iPad Pro in Early 2016, and"
_t4ru1_xAH4,142299,149709,"it only came to the 6th-gen budget iPad in early 2018, so that took about 2 years to"
_t4ru1_xAH4,149709,151079,make it’s way down.
_t4ru1_xAH4,151079,158530,"Moving on, in early 2019, the iPad Air 3 received the A12 chip, which only made it’s way down"
_t4ru1_xAH4,158530,164640,"to the budget iPad 8 in Late 2020, which is about a 1.5 year difference."
_t4ru1_xAH4,164640,170400,"The iPad Air 3 was also the first Air model to come with 64GB of base storage, and it"
_t4ru1_xAH4,170400,176269,"wasn’t until Late 2021 when the current budget iPad 9 started coming with 64gigs,"
_t4ru1_xAH4,176269,178890,which is a 2.5 year difference.
_t4ru1_xAH4,178890,183670,"On top of that, the Air 3 also received the True Tone display, which didn’t come to"
_t4ru1_xAH4,183670,190150,"the budget iPad until this current iPad 9, which is also a 2.5 year difference."
_t4ru1_xAH4,190150,194510,"So if we take all of that and average it out, it seems like a lot of the hand-me-downs take"
_t4ru1_xAH4,194510,199489,around 2 to 2.5 years to make their way down to the budget iPad.
_t4ru1_xAH4,199489,205689,Now before I apply that to the timeline of when each iPad received a full flat-sided
_t4ru1_xAH4,205689,211239,"redesign, I want to bust out the recent leaks and rumors we got concerning the budget iPad"
_t4ru1_xAH4,211239,214680,10 and see if those timelines match up!
_t4ru1_xAH4,214680,219319,"First of all, we got a leak from the king of Apple display leaks, Ross Young, who has"
_t4ru1_xAH4,219319,225010,been bang on with exact display detail leaks in the past including the 14.2 and 16.2”
_t4ru1_xAH4,225010,232390,"MacBook Pro displays, the 8.3” iPad Mini 6 display, and even the 13.6” M2 MacBook"
_t4ru1_xAH4,232390,233390,Air display.
_t4ru1_xAH4,233390,238200,"And recently, he claimed that the new iPad is gonna be getting a 10.5” display while"
_t4ru1_xAH4,238200,243450,"the ipad Air will remain at 10.9”, which totally makes sense because Apple wants the"
_t4ru1_xAH4,243450,246909,more expensive iPads to have larger displays.
_t4ru1_xAH4,246909,252480,"Now if that 10.5” display size sounds familiar, it should because that’s precisely the display"
_t4ru1_xAH4,252480,256430,size of the iPad Air 3 in 2019.
_t4ru1_xAH4,256430,262780,"And not only that, but the entire chassis and 10.5” display on the Air 3 was actually"
_t4ru1_xAH4,262780,266789,a hand-me-down from the 2017 iPad Pro.
_t4ru1_xAH4,266789,271151,"So looking at timelines, it took 2 years to get handed down from the iPad Pro to the iPad"
_t4ru1_xAH4,271151,278850,"Air, and then if the budget iPad 10 gets it this year, that would be a 3.5 year gap, so"
_t4ru1_xAH4,278850,285100,"I can totally see it being overdue for a 10.5” display upgrade, regardless of whether it"
_t4ru1_xAH4,285100,287850,actually gets a full redesign with it or not.
_t4ru1_xAH4,287850,292270,"Now moving onto 9to5mac’s exclusive leaks, they reported that the new iPad will come"
_t4ru1_xAH4,292270,298520,"with the A14 chip, 5G, USB-C connectivity and a Retina display of the same resolution"
_t4ru1_xAH4,298520,303150,"as the iPad Air’s display, so let’s look at each of those points."
_t4ru1_xAH4,303150,308479,The A14 chip totally makes sense because that’s the chip that the iPad Air 4 got back in Late
_t4ru1_xAH4,308480,314800,"2020, so if the new iPad 10 gets it, that’s a 2 year difference, which is spot on."
_t4ru1_xAH4,314800,321009,"And now in terms of the USB-C port, the iPad Pro originally got it in Late 2018, and then"
_t4ru1_xAH4,321010,328270,"it was handed down two years later to the iPad Air 4 in late 2020, and now, if the iPad"
_t4ru1_xAH4,328270,333720,"10 gets it, that would be another 2 years, which actually lines up pretty well!"
_t4ru1_xAH4,333720,338210,And the most important detail you need to realize is that whenever an iPad received
_t4ru1_xAH4,338210,346520,"the USB-C port, it always came hand in hand with a full redesign, so if the new iPad 10"
_t4ru1_xAH4,346520,352198,"had a redesign this year, that would be a solid 2 years since the iPad Air 4, which"
_t4ru1_xAH4,352199,358330,I believe lines up quite well to all of the hand-me-down comparisons I made in this video.
_t4ru1_xAH4,358330,363819,"So with that said, I want to dig into the common sense evidence both for and against"
_t4ru1_xAH4,363819,369729,"the idea of the iPad 10 receiving a redesign this year, before I give you guys my final"
_t4ru1_xAH4,369729,370729,prediction.
_t4ru1_xAH4,370729,376419,"First of all, this is gonna be the 10th-generation iPad, which is kind of perfect because Apple"
_t4ru1_xAH4,376419,381630,waited until the 10th-anniversay iPhone to give it a massive redesign with stainless
_t4ru1_xAH4,381630,383860,steel bands and Face ID.
_t4ru1_xAH4,383860,390240,But the #1 reason why it makes sense for this iPad to get a redesign is because the exclusive
_t4ru1_xAH4,390240,394470,information from 9to5mac has been very reliable in the past.
_t4ru1_xAH4,394470,399740,And the fact that their sources believe the USB-C port is coming to the budget iPad is
_t4ru1_xAH4,399740,406879,"a huge deal because in the past, USB-C ports were ONLY ever added to iPads if and when"
_t4ru1_xAH4,406879,409990,they received a full flat-sided redesign.
_t4ru1_xAH4,409990,416620,And the reason this makes sense is because the USB-C port is fairly fragile since it’s
_t4ru1_xAH4,416620,423039,a female connector that also has a floating male component in the middle of the port which
_t4ru1_xAH4,423039,428570,can potentially get damaged compared to Lightning which is fully female and can’t really get
_t4ru1_xAH4,428570,429570,damaged.
_t4ru1_xAH4,429570,437539,"For example, there have been cases where actual USB-C ports became loose and eventually damaged,"
_t4ru1_xAH4,437539,443510,requiring full replacement of the port itself instead of simply buying a new damaged Lightning
_t4ru1_xAH4,443510,447819,"cable, which shows that USB-C isn’t as reliable."
_t4ru1_xAH4,447819,454069,"So if this new iPad 10 comes with a new USB-C port, while reusing the old chamfered chassis"
_t4ru1_xAH4,454069,460780,"design, it would cause major problems because the USB-C port would be cut diagonally into"
_t4ru1_xAH4,460780,466139,"the rounded frame, so if you plug in a USB-C cable, the bottom side wouldn’t have as"
_t4ru1_xAH4,466139,472360,"much support as the top, leading to a potentially loose cable which would break the internal"
_t4ru1_xAH4,472360,473360,components.
_t4ru1_xAH4,473360,479780,"Because of this, I fully believe that the iPad absolutely NEEDS flat sides so that the"
_t4ru1_xAH4,479780,484110,"USB-C port is completely flat and level on the side of the iPad, making for the most"
_t4ru1_xAH4,484110,490569,"stable and reliable connection, and that’s why I think Apple only added USB-C alongside"
_t4ru1_xAH4,490569,492080,a full redesign.
_t4ru1_xAH4,492080,497300,"Not only that, but if Apple wants to discontinue the 1st-gen Apple pencil, the iPad also needs"
_t4ru1_xAH4,497300,502830,a full flat-sided redesign to support the magnetic wireless charging feature.
_t4ru1_xAH4,502830,509240,"So with that said, it seems very likely that we get a full redesign, but keep in mind that"
_t4ru1_xAH4,509240,515279,"when Apple redesigned the iPad Pro, they raised the price by $150, and then the same thing"
_t4ru1_xAH4,515279,520430,"for both the iPad mini and iPad Air, both raised by $100."
_t4ru1_xAH4,520430,528089,"So a redesign for the budget iPad would likely mean that the price will go up to $399, which"
_t4ru1_xAH4,528089,534269,"I think is completely fair because the redesign will be a huge deal, since it’ll honestly"
_t4ru1_xAH4,534269,540350,"cannabilize the sales of the more expensive iPad Air, especially since the A14 chip is"
_t4ru1_xAH4,540350,543319,more than powerful enough for a lot of people.
_t4ru1_xAH4,543320,548050,"And on top of that, redesigning the iPad 10 makes sense because it’ll allow Apple to"
_t4ru1_xAH4,548050,553750,"sell even more 2nd-gen Apple Pencils since the 1st-gen ones will no longer be supported,"
_t4ru1_xAH4,553750,558140,forcing people to upgrade to the new one with wireless charging support.
_t4ru1_xAH4,558140,562490,"And not only that, but they could even make a new Magic Keyboard case for the 10.5”"
_t4ru1_xAH4,562490,569100,"size to sell even more accessories, and of course, all of the USB-C chargers, adapters"
_t4ru1_xAH4,569100,571899,and accessories that Apple sells as well.
_t4ru1_xAH4,571899,577440,"However, there is a chance that Apple doesn’t redesign the iPad 10 this year, because as"
_t4ru1_xAH4,577440,583220,"we all know, this year’s iPhone 14 lineup will continue to use Lightning until next"
_t4ru1_xAH4,583220,588490,"year, when the iPhone 15 lineup is gonna finally make the switch to USB-C, so if Apple wanted"
_t4ru1_xAH4,588490,594220,"to, they could totally wait on a full budget iPad redesign until next year."
_t4ru1_xAH4,594220,598660,And this could also make sense for Apple because it would boost the sales of the more expensive
_t4ru1_xAH4,598660,607410,"iPads, and there’s also the fact that Apple could easily reuse that same 10.5” chassis"
_t4ru1_xAH4,607410,613690,"with the old design from both the 2019 iPad Air and the 2017 iPad Pro, which would be"
_t4ru1_xAH4,613690,620649,"the cheapest and easiest route for an incremental update, but that would of course mean no USB-C"
_t4ru1_xAH4,620649,621649,port.
_t4ru1_xAH4,621649,625600,"But in terms of my personal prediction, I have a feeling that 9to5mac’s sources are"
_t4ru1_xAH4,625600,633029,"right about USB-C coming to budget iPad, which I think means we will be getting a full redesign,"
_t4ru1_xAH4,633029,638529,and you should DEFINITELY wait 3 more months until that iPad comes out before you make
_t4ru1_xAH4,638529,641410,a major purchasing decision.
_t4ru1_xAH4,641410,644910,"So hopefully this video was helpful, and if it was, go ahead and click that circle above"
_t4ru1_xAH4,644910,648600,"to subscribe for more videos like this one, and definitely check out one of those two"

_t4ru1_xAH4,278850,285100,"I can totally see it being overdue for a 10.5” display upgrade, regardless of whether it"
_t4ru1_xAH4,285100,287850,actually gets a full redesign with it or not.
_t4ru1_xAH4,287850,292270,"Now moving onto 9to5mac’s exclusive leaks, they reported that the new iPad will come"
_t4ru1_xAH4,292270,298520,"with the A14 chip, 5G, USB-C connectivity and a Retina display of the same resolution"
_t4ru1_xAH4,298520,303150,"as the iPad Air’s display, so let’s look at each of those points."
_t4ru1_xAH4,303150,308479,The A14 chip totally makes sense because that’s the chip that the iPad Air 4 got back in Late
_t4ru1_xAH4,308480,314800,"2020, so if the new iPad 10 gets it, that’s a 2 year difference, which is spot on."
_t4ru1_xAH4,314800,321009,"And now in terms of the USB-C port, the iPad Pro originally got it in Late 2018, and then"
_t4ru1_xAH4,321010,328270,"it was handed down two years later to the iPad Air 4 in late 2020, and now, if the iPad"
_t4ru1_xAH4,328270,333720,"10 gets it, that would be another 2 years, which actually lines up pretty well!"
_t4ru1_xAH4,333720,338210,And the most important detail you need to realize is that whenever an iPad received
_t4ru1_xAH4,338210,346520,"the USB-C port, it always came hand in hand with a full redesign, so if the new iPad 10"
_t4ru1_xAH4,346520,352198,"had a redesign this year, that would be a solid 2 years since the iPad Air 4, which"
_t4ru1_xAH4,352199,358330,I believe lines up quite well to all of the hand-me-down comparisons I made in this video.
_t4ru1_xAH4,358330,363819,"So with that said, I want to dig into the common sense evidence both for and against"
_t4ru1_xAH4,363819,369729,"the idea of the iPad 10 receiving a redesign this year, before I give you guys my final"
_t4ru1_xAH4,369729,370729,prediction.
_t4ru1_xAH4,370729,376419,"First of all, this is gonna be the 10th-generation iPad, which is kind of perfect because Apple"
_t4ru1_xAH4,376419,381630,waited until the 10th-anniversay iPhone to give it a massive redesign with stainless
_t4ru1_xAH4,381630,383860,steel bands and Face ID.
_t4ru1_xAH4,383860,390240,But the #1 reason why it makes sense for this iPad to get a redesign is because the exclusive
_t4ru1_xAH4,390240,394470,information from 9to5mac has been very reliable in the past.
_t4ru1_xAH4,394470,399740,And the fact that their sources believe the USB-C port is coming to the budget iPad is
_t4ru1_xAH4,399740,406879,"a huge deal because in the past, USB-C ports were ONLY ever added to iPads if and when"
_t4ru1_xAH4,406879,409990,they received a full flat-sided redesign.
_t4ru1_xAH4,409990,416620,And the reason this makes sense is because the USB-C port is fairly fragile since it’s
_t4ru1_xAH4,416620,423039,a female connector that also has a floating male component in the middle of the port which
_t4ru1_xAH4,423039,428570,can potentially get damaged compared to Lightning which is fully female and can’t really get
_t4ru1_xAH4,428570,429570,damaged.
_t4ru1_xAH4,429570,437539,"For example, there have been cases where actual USB-C ports became loose and eventually damaged,"
_t4ru1_xAH4,437539,443510,requiring full replacement of the port itself instead of simply buying a new damaged Lightning
_t4ru1_xAH4,443510,447819,"cable, which shows that USB-C isn’t as reliable."
_t4ru1_xAH4,447819,454069,"So if this new iPad 10 comes with a new USB-C port, while reusing the old chamfered chassis"
_t4ru1_xAH4,454069,460780,"design, it would cause major problems because the USB-C port would be cut diagonally into"
_t4ru1_xAH4,460780,466139,"the rounded frame, so if you plug in a USB-C cable, the bottom side wouldn’t have as"
_t4ru1_xAH4,466139,472360,"much support as the top, leading to a potentially loose cable which would break the internal"
_t4ru1_xAH4,472360,473360,components.
_t4ru1_xAH4,473360,479780,"Because of this, I fully believe that the iPad absolutely NEEDS flat sides so that the"
_t4ru1_xAH4,479780,484110,"USB-C port is completely flat and level on the side of the iPad, making for the most"
_t4ru1_xAH4,484110,490569,"stable and reliable connection, and that’s why I think Apple only added USB-C alongside"
_t4ru1_xAH4,490569,492080,a full redesign.
_t4ru1_xAH4,492080,497300,"Not only that, but if Apple wants to discontinue the 1st-gen Apple pencil, the iPad also needs"
_t4ru1_xAH4,497300,502830,a full flat-sided redesign to support the magnetic wireless charging feature.
_t4ru1_xAH4,502830,509240,"So with that said, it seems very likely that we get a full redesign, but keep in mind that"
_t4ru1_xAH4,509240,515279,"when Apple redesigned the iPad Pro, they raised the price by $150, and then the same thing"
_t4ru1_xAH4,515279,520430,"for both the iPad mini and iPad Air, both raised by $100."
_t4ru1_xAH4,520430,528089,"So a redesign for the budget iPad would likely mean that the price will go up to $399, which"
_t4ru1_xAH4,528089,534269,"I think is completely fair because the redesign will be a huge deal, since it’ll honestly"
_t4ru1_xAH4,534269,540350,"cannabilize the sales of the more expensive iPad Air, especially since the A14 chip is"
_t4ru1_xAH4,540350,543319,more than powerful enough for a lot of people.
_t4ru1_xAH4,543320,548050,"And on top of that, redesigning the iPad 10 makes sense because it’ll allow Apple to"
_t4ru1_xAH4,548050,553750,"sell even more 2nd-gen Apple Pencils since the 1st-gen ones will no longer be supported,"
_t4ru1_xAH4,553750,558140,forcing people to upgrade to the new one with wireless charging support.
_t4ru1_xAH4,558140,562490,"And not only that, but they could even make a new Magic Keyboard case for the 10.5”"
_t4ru1_xAH4,562490,569100,"size to sell even more accessories, and of course, all of the USB-C chargers, adapters"
_t4ru1_xAH4,569100,571899,and accessories that Apple sells as well.
_t4ru1_xAH4,571899,577440,"However, there is a chance that Apple doesn’t redesign the iPad 10 this year, because as"
_t4ru1_xAH4,577440,583220,"we all know, this year’s iPhone 14 lineup will continue to use Lightning until next"
_t4ru1_xAH4,583220,588490,"year, when the iPhone 15 lineup is gonna finally make the switch to USB-C, so if Apple wanted"
_t4ru1_xAH4,588490,594220,"to, they could totally wait on a full budget iPad redesign until next year."
_t4ru1_xAH4,594220,598660,And this could also make sense for Apple because it would boost the sales of the more expensive
_t4ru1_xAH4,598660,607410,"iPads, and there’s also the fact that Apple could easily reuse that same 10.5” chassis"
_t4ru1_xAH4,607410,613690,"with the old design from both the 2019 iPad Air and the 2017 iPad Pro, which would be"
_t4ru1_xAH4,613690,620649,"the cheapest and easiest route for an incremental update, but that would of course mean no USB-C"
_t4ru1_xAH4,620649,621649,port.
_t4ru1_xAH4,621649,625600,"But in terms of my personal prediction, I have a feeling that 9to5mac’s sources are"
_t4ru1_xAH4,625600,633029,"right about USB-C coming to budget iPad, which I think means we will be getting a full redesign,"
_t4ru1_xAH4,633029,638529,and you should DEFINITELY wait 3 more months until that iPad comes out before you make
_t4ru1_xAH4,638529,641410,a major purchasing decision.
