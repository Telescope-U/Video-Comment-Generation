jLHoWtuGg2s,9200,15200,story time about how i kissed every  teacher i ever had a crush on and never  got caught disclaimer is not my story  time i sent me an instagram growing up i
jLHoWtuGg2s,15200,20480,was a spoiled brat my parents gave me  literally everything i ever wanted for  my 15th birthday i told my dad that if
jLHoWtuGg2s,20480,26320,he didn't get me a bmw i would run away  so on my 15th birthday i got the bmw  parents never said no to anything one
jLHoWtuGg2s,26320,32000,time i told my parents i wanted to have  a party at my house and they said no i  threw a tantrum and started to cry my  dad pulled out his credit card and told
jLHoWtuGg2s,32000,38000,me to stop crying and i could go buy  whatever i wanted and i pretty much  maxed out his card he did punish me for  a month but all he really took away was
jLHoWtuGg2s,38000,43520,the tv as you can see i was completely  entitled and yes looking back i would  love to punch myself i was a complete
jLHoWtuGg2s,43520,48719,brat when i got into high school i went  boy crazy parents told me they did not  want me having boyfriends but of course
jLHoWtuGg2s,48719,54879,i put up a fight they had no choice but  to let me have boyfriends i would bring  them over to my house all the time and i  would always take them up to my room and
jLHoWtuGg2s,54879,60160,lock our door my dad told me one time to  open the door and i wouldn't so he just  left me eventually i got bored with all
jLHoWtuGg2s,60160,66159,my boyfriends so i would just break up  with them but one day this new high  school teacher comes in we made eye  contact for about five seconds i was
jLHoWtuGg2s,66159,72159,obsessed follow for part two story time  about how i kissed every high school  teacher i had a crush on and never got  caught disclaimer it's not my story time
jLHoWtuGg2s,72159,77520,i said i mean instagram after we locked  ice for about five seconds he looked  away but i was totally obsessed he was
jLHoWtuGg2s,77520,83040,like the most perfect guy i'd ever seen  and the first thing i did was go to his  classroom i knocked on the door and as  soon as he saw me he smiled and said
jLHoWtuGg2s,83040,89200,come in he talked for about two minutes  and he told me that he was only  substituting so i knew i needed to make  my move really quick fortunately i was
jLHoWtuGg2s,89200,94880,not taking the classes that he was  substituting but i had to find a way to  get close to him so i started watching  everything that he did my school had a
jLHoWtuGg2s,94880,100799,big outdoors area and there were lots of  tables around and i noticed that he  would go behind the library to eat his  lunch so i started going behind the
jLHoWtuGg2s,100799,107680,library to eat my lunch i decided to get  there before he did said it would be  coincidence as soon as he saw me he  waved but he sat at another table so i
jLHoWtuGg2s,107680,113840,grabbed my food and went over to sit  with him that's when i started asking  him if he had a girlfriend he got super  red this guy was blushing and i knew
jLHoWtuGg2s,113840,120240,right away that he probably had a crush  on me he basically didn't give me a yes  or no about the girlfriend but i didn't  care but i didn't want to make my move
jLHoWtuGg2s,120240,126799,right away he said for the next three  days i sat with him at lunch finally he  asked me don't you have friends and i  said yes but they're all annoying that's
jLHoWtuGg2s,126799,132879,when i leaned in for the kiss and no he  did not pull away the kiss lasted for  about 10 seconds as soon as we pull away
jLHoWtuGg2s,132879,139440,he starts looking around to see if  anybody saw and he told me that i need  to find someone my own age by the way he  was 24 i was 17. next day at lunch i
jLHoWtuGg2s,139440,146640,asked him if he wanted to go to my car  and we ended up kissing three more times  that day that's when he asked me for my  phone number follow for part three
jLHoWtuGg2s,146640,151760,story time about how i kissed every  teacher i had a crush on and never got  caught disclaimers is not my  storytelling sentiment on instagram as
jLHoWtuGg2s,151760,157200,we were sitting in my car kissing he  asked me for my number gave him my  number and that's when he said that  because he's only a substitute teacher
jLHoWtuGg2s,157200,162239,we could still hang out outside of  school and i said of course the  following week he was gone because the
jLHoWtuGg2s,162239,167519,teacher he was substituting for was back  no he never called me a few months later  we had another substitute teacher and
jLHoWtuGg2s,167519,172800,this guy was also really good looking he  wasn't as good looking as the first one  but good enough to distract me this time
jLHoWtuGg2s,172800,178319,i got lucky he was substituting for  drama and i took drama twice a week so i  knew that i was going to be seeing him
jLHoWtuGg2s,178319,184400,often first thing i needed to do was get  him to notice me but this took a lot  longer than the other guy the first week  i would just try to talk to him but he
jLHoWtuGg2s,184400,190480,was not having it he would literally  tell me to just go sit down but i  couldn't give up one day after class i  decided to stay late i knew that he
jLHoWtuGg2s,190480,196080,would be staying late as well so i knew  that was my in i went up to him and  asked him if i could help him out he  said yes and he basically told me to put
jLHoWtuGg2s,196080,202239,away some of the costuming as we were  doing that i just started talking to him  and i swear to god for a minute this guy  forgot that i was a student we started
jLHoWtuGg2s,202239,207599,talking about everything by the end of  the conversation he told me that i was  really mature and that i made him laugh
jLHoWtuGg2s,207599,214080,so the next day i stayed after school  with him again this time we were  backstage organizing props and we were  completely isolated so when i told him
jLHoWtuGg2s,214080,220720,that i thought he was really cute and  that he was probably a good kisser then  he walks up to me and kisses me oh my  god the butterflies in my stomach he
jLHoWtuGg2s,220720,227280,stopped kissing me i pulled him in and  kissed him again that's when he came to  his senses and told me that i needed to  go home so i did and the following week
jLHoWtuGg2s,227280,233840,he was not there apparently he had a  family emergency but we know it's a lie  looking back on my behavior i'm totally  horrified where did i get the courage to
jLHoWtuGg2s,233840,240560,do all the things i did i never spoke to  any of them again but i did see one of  them on instagram i did not follow him  he's now got a big beer belly ew
jLHoWtuGg2s,240560,246239,definitely don't do what i did i could  go back i would not have done it bye am  i the for hiding the soda i feel
jLHoWtuGg2s,246239,252159,ridiculous for even posting this but i  need objective eyes on this background  one husband two step kids fifteen male
jLHoWtuGg2s,252159,257519,17 male married five years we keep  separate financial accounts if that  makes a difference and we alternate who
jLHoWtuGg2s,257519,262880,buys groceries week to week anyways  here's the deal i don't drink coffee i  drink mountain dew or the occasional
jLHoWtuGg2s,262880,268080,energy drink for my morning caffeine  kick my husband and the oldest stepson  are both coffee drinkers with increasing
jLHoWtuGg2s,268080,274560,frequency i'll go to grab a drink out of  the fridge and all of the soda and  energy drinks are gone the kids have  taken to coming home and grabbing two to
jLHoWtuGg2s,274560,279919,three or more sodas and before they left  for their mom's house last week the 15  year old was actually packing a six-pack
jLHoWtuGg2s,279919,285680,into his backpack to go the obvious  solution i thought was to buy more soda  yes i know it's awful for the kids but
jLHoWtuGg2s,285680,292320,if their dad isn't stopping them from  sucking down junk food it's not my deal  to intervene  good point for you yes you are correct
jLHoWtuGg2s,292320,298160,nope still gone to where i look for the  fridge for one single much needed energy  boost in nada so i started asking my
jLHoWtuGg2s,298160,303360,husband to pick up soda or a few energy  drinks on his grocery shopping week to  supplement his response was that he's
jLHoWtuGg2s,303360,308479,not wasting money on garbage like that  and to complain about how expensive  things like mountain dew are these days
jLHoWtuGg2s,308479,314479,then tell your kids to stop drinking  hers simple like okay you don't buy it  fine don't buy it but tell your kids  don't take your wife next tactic
jLHoWtuGg2s,314479,319680,was to ask that if the kids drink the  soda that they please leave a few behind  if it's obvious we're almost out so i
jLHoWtuGg2s,319680,326160,have at least one or two when i go to  grab one this is where things took a  turn for the worse my husband got  irritated and said that i was policing
jLHoWtuGg2s,326160,331440,the food and that no one who lives here  should have to ask permission to eat or  drink
jLHoWtuGg2s,331440,337360,really dude you pull that  fine i figured if i wanted to have a  mountain dew or energy drink for myself
jLHoWtuGg2s,337360,342639,i would just put a little mini fridge in  my office and stash a few in there i got  a tiny fridge that holds a six pack and
jLHoWtuGg2s,342639,347840,pops a few in there i put the cases i  buy in my office and put a week's worth  in the main fridge at a time so they
jLHoWtuGg2s,347840,354320,last until i shop again okay so you're  putting some like sticks in your own  little fridge and you're still putting a  pack in the big fridge
jLHoWtuGg2s,354320,360479,yesterday the 15 year old complained  that there hadn't been mountain dew in  the fridge for a few days and my husband  grumpily said go get them from your
jLHoWtuGg2s,360479,366479,stepmom's office she's hiding food and  snacks from you guys in there  what a piece of at this point i put
jLHoWtuGg2s,366479,371520,my foot down and said i'm hanging on to  some of the drinks that i like every  week because otherwise i don't get any
jLHoWtuGg2s,371520,378319,and if everyone else drank what i put in  the fridge for them before i shopped  again and my husband didn't want to buy  any himself that's just too bad my
jLHoWtuGg2s,378319,385120,husband still refuses to buy this load  himself but is convinced i'm being a  complete and total jerk because i'm  hiding what i purchased am i being
jLHoWtuGg2s,385120,391520,completely oblivious to my own  behavior here or is this as lopsided as  i think it is not your husband's psycho
jLHoWtuGg2s,391520,397600,what the heck he's not wasting money on  garbage but he's perfectly happy for you  to spend your money and not even drink
jLHoWtuGg2s,397600,404000,your own soda so  now get out of here  my boyfriend is moving in with his girl
jLHoWtuGg2s,404000,409199,best friend and i don't trust her one  bit disclaimer is not my story time is  sentimental instagram my boyfriend and i
jLHoWtuGg2s,409199,415840,have been together for almost a year  when i met him he already had a very big  group of best friends one of them was  this girl there's actually another girl
jLHoWtuGg2s,415840,421919,in the group but my boyfriend in this  particular girl let's call her lacey  lacy is completely obsessed with my
jLHoWtuGg2s,421919,427440,boyfriend i tell him all the time but he  doesn't want to listen to me she goes  out of her way to spend time with him
jLHoWtuGg2s,427440,434080,and she'll do girlfriend things for him  sometimes she'll call him and say i  cooked us dinner come over to my  apartment she even goes to his apartment
jLHoWtuGg2s,434080,439199,and helps him do laundry let me go back  though when we started dating he asked  me not to be uncomfortable and that him
jLHoWtuGg2s,439199,445360,and her were only good friends but as  soon as i saw them with each other it  was visible that she was in love with  him when he first brought me around to
jLHoWtuGg2s,445360,450400,meet his friends she was super  territorial she would sit next to him  and even sat on his lap in front of me
jLHoWtuGg2s,450400,455520,and this made my boyfriend uncomfortable  he asked her to sit on a chair instead  of his lap after that i asked him if he
jLHoWtuGg2s,455520,461840,had feelings for her and he said no he  said he's only ever seen her as a sister  that the thought of hooking up with her  makes him want to vomit stacy reached
jLHoWtuGg2s,461840,468160,out to me and asked me to have lunch  with her throughout the whole lunch all  she talked about was my boyfriend how  amazing he is and how only a good girl
jLHoWtuGg2s,468160,473280,deserves him part two is up  my boyfriend is moving in with his girl  best friend and i don't trust her
jLHoWtuGg2s,473280,478720,disclaimer this is not my story time i  would send him an instagram when her and  i went to lunch all she talked about was  my boyfriend that's when she started
jLHoWtuGg2s,478720,484960,saying things like he only deserves a  really good girl that's when i was  straight up with her i told her that he  had already chosen me because he loved
jLHoWtuGg2s,484960,490160,me and that i didn't need her to tell me  what my boyfriend needed you guys should  have seen the look on this girl's face
jLHoWtuGg2s,490160,496639,she was shocked that i would defend  myself and even talk back to her then  she said oh my god i'm so sorry i didn't  mean to make you feel bad i told her
jLHoWtuGg2s,496639,502720,that i didn't feel bad and that i knew  what she was doing she was basically  trying to intimidate me and make me feel  that i wasn't good enough for my
jLHoWtuGg2s,502720,508000,boyfriend she denied it and started  apologizing but at least i made it clear  to her that i was not stupid and that
jLHoWtuGg2s,508000,514000,she was not going to walk all over me  like she probably did with all of his  exes by the way one of his past  girlfriends actually broke up with her
jLHoWtuGg2s,514000,520560,because of this girl i mean lacey found  this out through one of the other  friends they told me that i needed to be  careful with her that's why i was
jLHoWtuGg2s,520560,526160,prepared to go to lunch with her that's  what happened though i called my  boyfriend to say hi to him and that's  when he starts yelling at me he said
jLHoWtuGg2s,526160,531600,lacey called him to tell him that i had  attacked her at lunch that i basically  threatened her i explained to him what
jLHoWtuGg2s,531600,536720,happened from my point of view he said  that she was probably just overreacting  but it was her word against mine part
jLHoWtuGg2s,536720,543360,three is up my boyfriend is moving in  with his girl best friend and i do not  trust her disclaimer this is not my  storytime i sent him an instagram after
jLHoWtuGg2s,543360,549040,lacey told my boyfriend that i had  attacked her and threatened her he told  me to keep my distance so i did but that
jLHoWtuGg2s,549040,555120,meant that he would hang out with her  without me i found this completely  unacceptable that's when i told my  boyfriend that she was manipulative and
jLHoWtuGg2s,555120,560640,she had clearly planned everything out  so that he and her could be alone then i  told him that his ex-girlfriend left him
jLHoWtuGg2s,560640,566240,because of her he told me that i didn't  know the full story and that i should  mind my own business that's when i  noticed that he wouldn't come over to my
jLHoWtuGg2s,566240,571279,apartment every day and guess why his  best friend lacey told him that she had  a stalker and that she needed my
jLHoWtuGg2s,571279,577279,boyfriend to stay over her house so that  she could feel protected and safe i just  can't i told him that she was clearly
jLHoWtuGg2s,577279,583839,manipulating him and probably lying  about the stalker situation so that he  could spend more time with her and just  like that two days later he told me that
jLHoWtuGg2s,583839,589600,they were moving in together that she  miraculously found an apartment big  enough for the two of them in two days i
jLHoWtuGg2s,589600,596080,don't think so i think she had been  planning this the whole time my  boyfriend is just stupid enough to fall  for it i told him if he moved in with
jLHoWtuGg2s,596080,601760,her that he should just forget about me  he begged me not to leave him so i guess  i'm still his girlfriend he's still  debating whether or not to move in with
jLHoWtuGg2s,601760,608320,her says he doesn't want to lose me but  he wants to be able to be there for her  i think i should break up with him but  maybe there's another solution what do
jLHoWtuGg2s,608320,615519,you guys think i should do  am i the for telling my husband  his name suggestion for our unborn baby
jLHoWtuGg2s,615519,621279,is idiotic at best hello all this has  caused quite a stir on both sides of the
jLHoWtuGg2s,621279,626880,family and my niece suggested that i  post here so as to garner unbiased  opinions
jLHoWtuGg2s,626880,633200,unfortunately as it is relevant to the  story i will have to keep much personal  information uncensored in this story
jLHoWtuGg2s,633200,640800,as such this is a throwaway account  my 35 female husband 37 male and i are
jLHoWtuGg2s,640800,647120,pregnant with our first child  we are overjoyed as we have struggled  with perceived infertility and
jLHoWtuGg2s,647120,652320,miscarriages for the last decade  we want the gender to be a surprise but
jLHoWtuGg2s,652320,658320,may have to find out to settle this i am  currently at the tail end of my second  trimester
jLHoWtuGg2s,658320,663760,now my husband absolutely idolized his  grandpa who unfortunately passed away
jLHoWtuGg2s,663760,670800,last week  my husband is devastated especially  about the notion that his children will  never meet their great grandpa who their
jLHoWtuGg2s,670800,677200,father adored so much  as such my husband has suggested that we  name the baby after grandpa
jLHoWtuGg2s,677200,682720,theodore if it's a boy theodora if it's  a girl either way we will either call
jLHoWtuGg2s,682720,688399,them teddy or theo  thea respectively it's not that i mind  the name
jLHoWtuGg2s,688399,695040,the issue is that our last name is bund  pronounced bundy  i asked my husband do you really see no
jLHoWtuGg2s,695040,700640,issue with naming our kid teddy bundy  you don't think that would raise any  questions
jLHoWtuGg2s,700640,705680,he says no he's just honoring his  grandpa  i told him he needs to think about how
jLHoWtuGg2s,705680,712240,we will be perceived how our child will  be treated and the implications that  that name inherently carries
jLHoWtuGg2s,712240,718320,i literally had to spell out why that  would be a horrible idea  and he still thinks i just hate his
jLHoWtuGg2s,718320,724639,grandpa  i told him no grandpa was named in 1930  when the name teddy bundy wouldn't have
jLHoWtuGg2s,724639,729920,been a problem however since certain  events in the 70s and 80s there is no
jLHoWtuGg2s,729920,737279,feasible way we can give him this name  to our kid and not cause issues  he kept pushing and pushing until i blew
jLHoWtuGg2s,737279,745680,up and told him to stop with the idiotic  suggestion and that is what it is  idiotic at best sociopathic at worst he
jLHoWtuGg2s,745680,751200,got extremely upset and told his family  and my parents who are divided
jLHoWtuGg2s,751200,758160,his family is obviously on his side and  wants to honor grandpa via naming the  baby after him my parents are torn but
jLHoWtuGg2s,758160,764480,on my side as they understand the social  pariah that we would make our child by  giving him such a similar name to the
jLHoWtuGg2s,764480,770000,person who did such abhorrent and  downright evil things to so many women
jLHoWtuGg2s,770000,776079,i mean personally i don't think anyone  is just going to assume that we are  honoring a past loved one they're just
jLHoWtuGg2s,776079,781200,going to think of ted bundy am i the   what kind of crazy fantasyland
jLHoWtuGg2s,781200,786399,denial is this guy living in next he's  going to be like yeah well we're going  to have another boy and he's gonna be
jLHoWtuGg2s,786399,791760,adolf hitler like what's the problem  with that name honey and it's fine if  she's born a woman it's gonna be
jLHoWtuGg2s,791760,797760,margaret thatcher easy name choice i  think this one's an easy not the  i don't know why the family is on the
jLHoWtuGg2s,797760,804320,husband's side this seems pretty obvious  to me but some people just built  different i guess op has offered the
jLHoWtuGg2s,804320,809760,following explanation for why they think  they might be the  i might be the because i rudely
jLHoWtuGg2s,809760,815440,told my husband that i didn't like his  name suggestions due to social  implications around the name even though
jLHoWtuGg2s,815440,820639,our baby would be named after someone we  loved very much  now in the comments
jLHoWtuGg2s,820639,827680,not the please do not name your  kid in effect ted bundy  literally ignore everybody encouraging
jLHoWtuGg2s,827680,832720,you to name your kid ted bundy  lol anyone encouraging you to name your
jLHoWtuGg2s,832720,839440,kid ted bundy may in fact be an in the  closet murderer  the answer is easy you and your husband
jLHoWtuGg2s,839440,846160,change your last name to your maiden  name no more issue with teddy unless  your maiden name is ruxpin hey it's not
jLHoWtuGg2s,846160,853600,like any kid is gonna know what the hell  teddy ruxpin is unlike ted bundy who  will stay infamous for decades at least
jLHoWtuGg2s,853600,859839,not the i have a friend who has  a very similar name to a well-known  serial killer he has to wind up
jLHoWtuGg2s,859839,866320,basically apologizing for his name  wherever he goes even though he has  absolutely no relationship to the guy
jLHoWtuGg2s,866320,871760,it's pretty sad there are many ways you  can honor your husband's grandfather  without giving the babies such an
jLHoWtuGg2s,871760,879040,unfortunate name  this is my friend john wayne glacey  we're also friends with charles mason
jLHoWtuGg2s,879040,885600,not the if your last name is  dharma you probably stay away from  geoffrey i share the name of a famous
jLHoWtuGg2s,885600,890880,athlete in the states that he played  college ball  i was eight when he became famous so i
jLHoWtuGg2s,890880,896480,wasn't named after him just coincidence  it comes with its own issues nothing too
jLHoWtuGg2s,896480,903519,bad outside of people thinking that i'm  him finding my address by typing my name  into google and then they stop by my
jLHoWtuGg2s,903519,909600,house it's happened twice  i couldn't imagine having to share a  name with a serial killer not the
jLHoWtuGg2s,909600,915600, even if the name wasn't bad in  this way it takes two yeses for a baby's
jLHoWtuGg2s,915600,921839,name  two  even if you simply didn't like the name  your no means no
jLHoWtuGg2s,921839,926880,how many people did it take to make the  baby two  how many people will it take to raise
jLHoWtuGg2s,926880,932079,the baby two how many people get to  decide on the name  two
jLHoWtuGg2s,932079,938800,one no equals no  not the why does he love his  grandpa more than his own child i have
jLHoWtuGg2s,938800,945759,bad news for your husband  grandpa is dead and won't know the  difference the kid will don't let him do
jLHoWtuGg2s,945759,951600,it  now back up to the post we have some  edits and updates  edit
jLHoWtuGg2s,951600,958079,just to say that you guys are all  proving my point that ted bundy is  clearly still an infamous name there has
jLHoWtuGg2s,958079,964079,not been one comment that didn't  immediately make the correlation upon  hearing my last name that is exactly
jLHoWtuGg2s,964079,971279,what i don't want to have happen to my  child  kids are dicks and they're going to find  a way to be mean let's not just hand
jLHoWtuGg2s,971279,976639,them the material  edit 2 bundy's full name was theodore  bundy
jLHoWtuGg2s,976639,982800,that's where this problem is ultimately  stemming from when a teacher reads the  name from the role be it theodore or
jLHoWtuGg2s,982800,988320,theodora they aren't going to assume a  nickname it's just gonna be the full  thing
jLHoWtuGg2s,988320,995759,update and final edit  so i tried to make an update post but i  decided to just throw my update in here
jLHoWtuGg2s,995759,1001360,essentially my husband stayed with his  brother and sister-in-law for a night  and they talked it out
jLHoWtuGg2s,1001360,1006959,his brother was also very close with  their grandpa so i think hearing the  same logic from someone grieving just as
jLHoWtuGg2s,1006959,1013920,much knocked some sense into him  they explained why he couldn't just name  his kid teddy bundy and especially
jLHoWtuGg2s,1013920,1021360,because we live in the western us in one  of the states where he operated and was  also caught imprisoned and escaped
jLHoWtuGg2s,1021360,1026640,i don't even think it's legal to use  that name  we spoke briefly on the phone before he
jLHoWtuGg2s,1026640,1032240,came home where i apologized for how  rude i was when he kept suggesting the  name
jLHoWtuGg2s,1032240,1037760,i explained that i was just stressed  that he was seemingly overlooking just  how bad it would be to have a kid with
jLHoWtuGg2s,1037760,1043360,the same name as a very notorious serial  killer and i didn't feel listened to
jLHoWtuGg2s,1043360,1049120,he apologized as well telling me that  his grief was clouding his judgment and  that he also understands why we can't
jLHoWtuGg2s,1049120,1055039,give our child grandpa's name  while we did want to keep the gender a  surprise we felt like we had to look at
jLHoWtuGg2s,1055039,1062799,the ultrasound to help hash this out  we are having a baby boy and decided to  give him his grandpa's middle name silas
jLHoWtuGg2s,1062799,1068880,our son will have the name silas bundy  we also decided to go through with  marriage counselling as well as grief
jLHoWtuGg2s,1068880,1074640,counselling for my husband  he asked me to attend and i'm sure i  could learn how to be more compassionate
jLHoWtuGg2s,1074640,1081919,about his loss  i was never too close with my  grandparents so i'm trying to be here  for him but can't empathize as well as i
jLHoWtuGg2s,1081919,1087840,could  all in all this worked out  thank you so so much for everyone who
jLHoWtuGg2s,1087840,1093440,gave their opinions you really helped us  out here  this will be my final update i'm going
jLHoWtuGg2s,1093440,1099440,to be deleting this account as i've  already docked myself enough and i've  been sent links to articles and videos
jLHoWtuGg2s,1099440,1105039,that people have started using this  story in  once again thank you all so much
jLHoWtuGg2s,1105039,1111919,this was such a wild thing that i  honestly never thought would happen but  yeah i'm so glad this has been worked
jLHoWtuGg2s,1111919,1118240,through  thank you everyone and now for some  comments  my sister thought will was a good name
jLHoWtuGg2s,1118240,1124160,for my firstborn i said you know they'll  call him willy  she thought that was fine until i
jLHoWtuGg2s,1124160,1129440,reminded her my last name is nelson  up until my mom was in labor she was
jLHoWtuGg2s,1129440,1136400,sent on naming me indiana  indiana jones  luckily someone convinced her otherwise
jLHoWtuGg2s,1136400,1142240,i would be less worried about the kid  themself at least for the first 10 or  more years of their life and more
jLHoWtuGg2s,1142240,1149360,worried about how the parents would be  perceived we just had and still are  having a true crime moment in american
jLHoWtuGg2s,1149360,1156880,popular culture  other parents would straight up assume  you named the kid after the serial  killer based on like five tv shows about
jLHoWtuGg2s,1156880,1162880,him that have streamed in the past few  years they're gonna think that you saw  zac efron as a sexy serial killer and
jLHoWtuGg2s,1162880,1168160,thought i like the sound of that  they're gonna think that you are at best
jLHoWtuGg2s,1168160,1175360,a true crime fan with a complete  disconnect from the human cost which  will of course have social consequences
jLHoWtuGg2s,1175360,1182000,for your kid as every parent sees his  name says yikes and vows to have as  little interaction with his parents as
jLHoWtuGg2s,1182000,1189039,they can  this kid is going to forever be  explaining how to pronounce that last  name anyway and at some point the
jLHoWtuGg2s,1189039,1195840,teenage boy will say bundy like the  serial killer  but i'm glad the parents worked out a
jLHoWtuGg2s,1195840,1201280,compromise and are also taking steps to  improve some parts of their relationship  overall
jLHoWtuGg2s,1201280,1208000,parenting requires many compromises it's  good to learn how to do that well early
jLHoWtuGg2s,1208000,1214320,unexposed is titled how do i break up  with my boyfriend for being dirty  without offending him
jLHoWtuGg2s,1214320,1220559,i 24 female have been dating my  boyfriend 24 male for six years now
jLHoWtuGg2s,1220559,1225840,we both live at home to save money he  lives in an apartment with his parents  and dogs
jLHoWtuGg2s,1225840,1231760,now let me start by saying i love him  and his family is so sweet to me and i  never would want to disrespect them or
jLHoWtuGg2s,1231760,1237360,hurt their feelings but i can't take  being there anymore  when we first started dating it was
jLHoWtuGg2s,1237360,1242480,never really dirty but in the past three  years it has gotten progressively worse
jLHoWtuGg2s,1242480,1248000,and they now have a very bad roach  infestation  they also have flies or other bugs
jLHoWtuGg2s,1248000,1253280,sometimes but the roaches are the big  problem  i've been asking my boyfriend to do
jLHoWtuGg2s,1253280,1259440,something about it before i come over  and he'll tell me he cleaned but you'd  never be able to tell the floors are
jLHoWtuGg2s,1259440,1266240,sticky because of pet pee he leaves soda  cans and bottles around his room and  crumbs on the bed the bathroom is
jLHoWtuGg2s,1266240,1271840,infested with roaches so i try not to  use it  the pets also use the bathroom as their
jLHoWtuGg2s,1271840,1278240,own so it is messy  i asked him to get the sticky fly tape  that you can hang that is super cheap to
jLHoWtuGg2s,1278240,1285039,catch flies  he still hasn't even done that  at one point when i went over i would be
jLHoWtuGg2s,1285039,1290640,itchy and had little red bumps on me the  next day  i realized it was bug bites
jLHoWtuGg2s,1290640,1297039,since then i have limited the times i've  come over to once every few months  he tells me he doesn't clean because
jLHoWtuGg2s,1297039,1303280,he's tired he does have a physically  exhausting job but he also gets paid  well so he could have paid someone to
jLHoWtuGg2s,1303280,1308559,fix the bug problem but he won't he says  he won't pay for an exterminator or bug
jLHoWtuGg2s,1308559,1315280,killing things because it's his parents  place and not his responsibility and  he's going to move out eventually so
jLHoWtuGg2s,1315280,1320320,he'd rather save his money for his own  place but he has no timeline on when he
jLHoWtuGg2s,1320320,1326960,would move out  the last straw was this weekend  i visited for the first time in months
jLHoWtuGg2s,1326960,1333120,he told me he cleaned it before i came  it wasn't clean  so i just sat at the edge of the bed
jLHoWtuGg2s,1333120,1338480,while we watched a movie then i saw a  huge roach on the wall above the bed
jLHoWtuGg2s,1338480,1343760,i asked him to kill it and he did  but he left the roach guts on the wall
jLHoWtuGg2s,1343760,1349919,and he didn't even clean it up and throw  it out  this was after i already was swatting  flies
jLHoWtuGg2s,1349919,1357600,at that point i was ready to go  i suggested we do something outside and  i could tell that he was annoyed he said
jLHoWtuGg2s,1357600,1364400,so you want to leave because of bugs i  didn't want to hurt his feelings so i  try to just say i want to go out and
jLHoWtuGg2s,1364400,1371600,have fun but he asked again so i told  him yeah  bugs and i want to go out and have fun
jLHoWtuGg2s,1371600,1376880,so then he takes his sweet time getting  ready  i tried to be patient but i had my coat
jLHoWtuGg2s,1376880,1384240,on and i was just standing there waiting  while he was watching the movie slowly  pulling on clothes i said come on let's
jLHoWtuGg2s,1384240,1390320,go  and he snapped and asked are you in a  rush you're in a rush to leave
jLHoWtuGg2s,1390320,1395360,i just said no but i'm just standing  here in my coat come on
jLHoWtuGg2s,1395360,1402799,he continued to take forever to put on a  sweatshirt and sneakers he had an  attitude after that the next morning at
jLHoWtuGg2s,1402799,1410000,my house i woke up and swatted my arm  because i felt something crawling on me  it was smashed by the time i looked but
jLHoWtuGg2s,1410000,1415280,it looked like what i see at his house  i nearly had a breakdown because i hate
jLHoWtuGg2s,1415280,1420880,bugs plus i live with my family and i  can't bring that stuff here
jLHoWtuGg2s,1420880,1427520,i spent the whole day cleaning my room  my clothes everything  i didn't go on my phone the entire day i
jLHoWtuGg2s,1427520,1433360,didn't reply to his texts until i was  ready to go to bed  he asked me if i was okay and i said
jLHoWtuGg2s,1433360,1439039,yeah because i didn't want to argue over  the phone when we both needed sleep for  work in the am
jLHoWtuGg2s,1439039,1445919,i also needed time to process everything  i have been patient and i've given  suggestions on ways to clean his room
jLHoWtuGg2s,1445919,1451840,and kill the bugs for like three years  now  i love him but honestly i just feel like
jLHoWtuGg2s,1451840,1458720,he is so dirty i don't know what to do  we already don't see each other often  and book a hotel once a month to get
jLHoWtuGg2s,1458720,1464400,alone time i don't want to be intimate  anymore if he is this content on being  this dirty
jLHoWtuGg2s,1464400,1471279,how do i break up with my long-term  boyfriend for being dirty what do i say  without being harsh and now in the
jLHoWtuGg2s,1471279,1476559,comments being gentle with him won't  help him rip the band-aid and just be
jLHoWtuGg2s,1476559,1483200,honest whether he goes on to realize his  problem or forever blame you you did the  right thing for him to the very end if
jLHoWtuGg2s,1483200,1489520,you just stay honest  and op says i guess i have a problem  being to the point when i know the words
jLHoWtuGg2s,1489520,1496480,can hurt someone but i will just be  honest with him  this is a man who 100 plans on moving in
jLHoWtuGg2s,1496480,1503039,with his significant other and is still  acting like this because if he won't  clean in these conditions he won't clean
jLHoWtuGg2s,1503039,1508400,when it's a new place  it's gross he's gross it is time to go
jLHoWtuGg2s,1508400,1514640,he doesn't want to grow up and you  already are past him as someone who once  lived with a man moved in with a friend
jLHoWtuGg2s,1514640,1520640,and her boyfriend it is sickening to  have to live with someone who can't  clean after themselves opie he
jLHoWtuGg2s,1520640,1526799,definitely won't clean and if y'all move  in together it'll turn into you  parenting him and telling him to clean
jLHoWtuGg2s,1526799,1533840,all the time when i lived with my past  roommates the guy who was messy always  left plates and utensils in his room
jLHoWtuGg2s,1533840,1539440,hated doing dishes and always half-assed  cleaned them  his shoes were always just strewn about
jLHoWtuGg2s,1539440,1546480,the hallway etc etc  i'm thankful i didn't have to share a  room with him  we also had roaches due to living next
jLHoWtuGg2s,1546480,1552159,door to the river and his uncleanliness  definitely didn't help at all  not fun
jLHoWtuGg2s,1552159,1559440,oh honey you deserve a normal clean  hygienic life where you can relax  without insects crawling all over you if
jLHoWtuGg2s,1559440,1565600,you were to live with this man your life  would be reduced to servitude  i know because i spent six years of my
jLHoWtuGg2s,1565600,1571200,life sweeping scrubbing wiping up slime  picking up trash washing skid marked
jLHoWtuGg2s,1571200,1577039,laundry and fighting clutter created day  after day after day by my former partner
jLHoWtuGg2s,1577039,1583200,a man who grew up in filth like that  doesn't even know what a normal home is  like his behavior when you asked him to
jLHoWtuGg2s,1583200,1588690,clean shows that he will never change  my partner was fun at first
jLHoWtuGg2s,1588690,1600429,[Music]
jLHoWtuGg2s,1607730,1619120,[Music]  my  [Music]
jLHoWtuGg2s,1619120,1622120,oh
jLHoWtuGg2s,1624380,1631600,[Music]  and now on to the update
jLHoWtuGg2s,1631600,1638080,so i broke up with him before the post  got as many replies as it did  i called him and let him know how i felt
jLHoWtuGg2s,1638080,1643600,about the situation and that it's best  if we're just single and focus on  ourselves right now
jLHoWtuGg2s,1643600,1648880,he said he understood and it was a quick  call  he texted me right after saying he
jLHoWtuGg2s,1648880,1655279,wished i told him how i felt while i was  there instead of waiting  i told him that i did tell him i was
jLHoWtuGg2s,1655279,1660960,ready to go because of the bugs and he  caught an attitude  he apologized for responding the way he
jLHoWtuGg2s,1660960,1667039,did and said he was just embarrassed  especially since we already hadn't seen  each other in over a month he wanted to
jLHoWtuGg2s,1667039,1674159,spend more time with me etc  i let him know that i do feel where he's  coming from but if after three years he
jLHoWtuGg2s,1674159,1679520,can't even bother to get a fly strip i  can't just take his word that he'll do  better anymore
jLHoWtuGg2s,1679520,1685360,i blocked him and this is the longest  we've gone without speaking one week  today
jLHoWtuGg2s,1685360,1692399,i don't have bedbugs plus i haven't seen  another bug since that morning i still  deep cleaned my room to be sure
jLHoWtuGg2s,1692399,1697679,if anyone is curious it was small plus  black plus maybe grey it kinda looked
jLHoWtuGg2s,1697679,1702960,like the middle one in this picture  i only have him on facebook for now but
jLHoWtuGg2s,1702960,1709039,we haven't spoken to each other  i told my closest friends that we broke  up i didn't tell them how bad his
jLHoWtuGg2s,1709039,1715520,apartment is just that i've asked him to  do something for a few years now and he  hasn't followed through
jLHoWtuGg2s,1715520,1723279,i've been throwing away small  sentimental items he has given me like  one to two a day so far and it's helping
jLHoWtuGg2s,1723279,1728640,my friend's birthday was over the  weekend so we went out for dinner and  drinks and it was great to go out with
jLHoWtuGg2s,1728640,1733760,the girls the timing was impeccable i  had a great time
jLHoWtuGg2s,1733760,1740720,right now i'm learning how to be single  especially single as an adult in her  twenties i'm the girl that's always been
jLHoWtuGg2s,1740720,1747279,in a relationship in high school and  college so it's a huge adjustment  i know how to be alone doing things on
jLHoWtuGg2s,1747279,1752720,my own being content when i'm by myself  and going out by myself etc but being
jLHoWtuGg2s,1752720,1758960,single is completely different  thinking of dating again seems pretty  scary right now because the last
jLHoWtuGg2s,1758960,1765120,standards i had going into a  relationship were for teenage me  people in their 20s are often open to
jLHoWtuGg2s,1765120,1771600,visiting someone's house and getting  intimate soon etc  i'm not interested in taking that route
jLHoWtuGg2s,1771600,1778240,plus feel that it comes with a big  safety risk i don't see myself dating  for a while but i'd appreciate any tips
jLHoWtuGg2s,1778240,1783760,on being single safe and eventually  dating again  ends now in the comments
jLHoWtuGg2s,1783760,1789840,that sounds like a carpet beetle it's a  pest to be sure but nothing close to as  bad as bed bugs
jLHoWtuGg2s,1789840,1796720,they are not a threat to you directly  because they do not bite but the larvae  can cause rashes and irritation they are
jLHoWtuGg2s,1796720,1803120,however a threat to your natural fibers  because the larvae feed off of wool silk  cotton and leather
jLHoWtuGg2s,1803120,1808480,i was in non-stop relationships from 14  to 25. one of my friend's moms actually
jLHoWtuGg2s,1808480,1814080,told me yikes sounds like you need to be  single for a good one to two years to
jLHoWtuGg2s,1814080,1820720,decompress after all that  and she was 100 right  it was a process learning how to be
jLHoWtuGg2s,1820720,1826720,comfortable fill the silence rely on  myself etc  the best thing that worked for me was
jLHoWtuGg2s,1826720,1833840,creating and sticking to a schedule  exercise daily for one hour sunday is  laundry and house cleaning day monday is
jLHoWtuGg2s,1833840,1840000,grocery shopping day tuesday i cooked  dinner for myself and would invite a few  friends to come over wednesday and
jLHoWtuGg2s,1840000,1846559,thursday night sweater myself to watch a  movie and catch up on shows and friday  and saturday were dedicated to having
jLHoWtuGg2s,1846559,1853440,plans with friends usually organized a  week in advance or more  and worst case have folks over
jLHoWtuGg2s,1853440,1858880,stay busy don't date don't even show  interest it's too tempting to get back
jLHoWtuGg2s,1858880,1865519,into a relationship so you don't feel  lonely but it won't help you long term  being confident with yourself
jLHoWtuGg2s,1865519,1871120,right now work on being your best self  so in a year you are 100
jLHoWtuGg2s,1871120,1876480,and ready to attract a partner who is  also 100 their best self don't get into
jLHoWtuGg2s,1876480,1882880,a relationship and expect to become your  best self later  self-improvement happens on your time
jLHoWtuGg2s,1882880,1889039,not someone else's  and op says sounds like your friend's  mom would tell me the same thing
jLHoWtuGg2s,1889039,1896000,this is really helpful  thanks one thing i did was get pretty  into the law of attraction i dove into
jLHoWtuGg2s,1896000,1902640,work got ahead in my career and it made  me have much higher standards  i dated a guy a long time ago that was
jLHoWtuGg2s,1902640,1907679,messy his bathroom didn't look like it  had ever been cleaned no bugs as were in
jLHoWtuGg2s,1907679,1914480,michigan and that's a less common  problem in the north to have roaches  he came over to my house i'm on the very
jLHoWtuGg2s,1914480,1919760,tidy side of the scale and he had an eye  booger or something that he wiped on my  couch
jLHoWtuGg2s,1919760,1925279,done  i broke up with him over the phone a few  days later and let him know that we  weren't on the same page with
jLHoWtuGg2s,1925279,1932399,cleanliness and organization and the  relationship wasn't a good match  we were just dating not exclusive or
jLHoWtuGg2s,1932399,1939760,anything  a little attempt to negotiate on his end  but i'm looking for someone who's the  right match for me and i don't expect
jLHoWtuGg2s,1939760,1944880,someone to make big changes in  themselves for me  everyone should be free to go find the
jLHoWtuGg2s,1944880,1950799,person who was already perfect for their  particular life situation  and what's important to them
jLHoWtuGg2s,1950799,1956799,jesus feels like i need to shower after  reading about his apartment  there wasn't nearly enough fear of
jLHoWtuGg2s,1956799,1961840,bedbugs in either of these posts bedbugs  are awful by the time they're big enough
jLHoWtuGg2s,1961840,1967679,for you to easily see them they are  dropping eggs everywhere they walk i'm  glad they did the right thing because
jLHoWtuGg2s,1967679,1973840,that mess was him as much as it was his  parents and him moving out wasn't going  to fix anything
jLHoWtuGg2s,1973840,1979760,judging from his reaction to her wanting  to leave  i was afraid that he would take the  break up badly and lash out at her
jLHoWtuGg2s,1979760,1987480,somehow  i'm glad that he accepted the situation  and didn't try to bully her out of her  decision

jLHoWtuGg2s,2031519,2036640,unexposed is titled hey mom my wife and  i have lived together for a long time
jLHoWtuGg2s,2036640,2042320,and i'm very comfortable with food prep  routines with her  however we now have an adult man as a
jLHoWtuGg2s,2042320,2049599,roommate and i can't keep any food or  drinks in the house long enough  just for context my wife and i are
jLHoWtuGg2s,2049599,2055760,lesbians and have never lived with men  before  that's why this whole thing is annoying  to adjust to
jLHoWtuGg2s,2055760,2063040,neither of us eat very much thanks to a  combo of meds and eating disorder  history so food and drinks last a while
jLHoWtuGg2s,2063040,2069839,before i have to make them again  for example i made three gallons of  unsweetened iced tea maybe two to three
jLHoWtuGg2s,2069839,2077200,days ago  it's gone i made 50 uncrustable  sandwiches and it lasted two days
jLHoWtuGg2s,2077200,2082878,i got a 12 pack of sparkling water and  didn't even get any  we don't really cook here because
jLHoWtuGg2s,2082878,2089440,between the three of us we have sensory  issues that make most bulk meals  impossible to eat and we all work
jLHoWtuGg2s,2089440,2095358,multiple jobs  i've tried separating my drinks into  personal food and that works sometimes
jLHoWtuGg2s,2095358,2102400,but he's allowed to eat and drink  we split the groceries cost i just
jLHoWtuGg2s,2102400,2108320,literally can't make enough to last and  i am so tired of constantly being out of  things i want
jLHoWtuGg2s,2108320,2113359,any ideas how to make more bulk things  storage ideas for how to make more of
jLHoWtuGg2s,2113359,2119760,anything at once  we do have a deep freezer we can use but  if 50 uncrustables for example are out
jLHoWtuGg2s,2119760,2126320,in three days between the three of us  eating them with him eating way more how  can i possibly prep enough to have a
jLHoWtuGg2s,2126320,2131839,stock  i am overwhelmed we are going through  food way more than we used to and i am
jLHoWtuGg2s,2131839,2139040,too tired to keep doing this  my idea on this would be to have that  talk with him as hard as that is
jLHoWtuGg2s,2139040,2145920,sometimes you really need to set up some  firm boundaries with this man because he  is stepping all over it and even though
jLHoWtuGg2s,2145920,2153119,he may have sensory issues as well that  doesn't give him a free pass to eat all  of your food you were not his maids you
jLHoWtuGg2s,2153119,2158240,were not his mother he is his own person  who can make his own food sharing is
jLHoWtuGg2s,2158240,2165040,great but it seems that he is not doing  anything to provide back for you guys he  is not making meals for you guys you
jLHoWtuGg2s,2165040,2170560,were doing all the work and he's eating  all of your food i'd feel majorly  disrespected by that and i would cut it
jLHoWtuGg2s,2170560,2175839,off way earlier than you guys have  allowed this to go let's see what the  comments have to say
jLHoWtuGg2s,2175839,2181920,it might be time to re-evaluate your  stance on food maybe you need to tell  him you will each pay for your own now
jLHoWtuGg2s,2181920,2187839,and make some rules about not eating and  drinking the other's stuff  it's not an unusual or even unreasonable
jLHoWtuGg2s,2187839,2193520,policy  yeah i've had a number of roommates over  the years and never shared groceries or
jLHoWtuGg2s,2193520,2200560,food with any of them there is no reason  op can't tell the new roommates they  will no longer be sharing food it may be
jLHoWtuGg2s,2200560,2206640,an awkward conversation at first but  continuing the current arrangement is  not sustainable and will only lead to
jLHoWtuGg2s,2206640,2212000,resentment  yes  and one thing is sharing grocery costs
jLHoWtuGg2s,2212000,2217760,another is absolutely monopolizing every  single food item and being disrespectful
jLHoWtuGg2s,2217760,2224079,eating most of everything when you are  literally one third of the population in  the home not the majority
jLHoWtuGg2s,2224079,2231280,he is eating most of the things she's  slash they are prepping too  that is too far that is taking advantage
jLHoWtuGg2s,2231280,2236800,of people's efforts and kindness  endop says thank you for saying that i
jLHoWtuGg2s,2236800,2242640,truly felt so selfish when i posted this  and now i just feel embarrassed that i  haven't been more forceful about my
jLHoWtuGg2s,2242640,2248320,boundaries  he just chips and chips and chips at any  boundary that i put up and it's too
jLHoWtuGg2s,2248320,2253599,exhausting to fight there is no reason  he can't buy and prepare food and he
jLHoWtuGg2s,2253599,2259520,needs to  it's not just the money it's the time  and effort to go into preparing food
jLHoWtuGg2s,2259520,2265839,i have teen sons and we have similar  issues with food we also have to be  careful about restricting food with a
jLHoWtuGg2s,2265839,2272640,younger because he was food insecure  before his adoption and has a tendency  toward hoarding or eating in secrets
jLHoWtuGg2s,2272640,2279920,which isn't necessary in our home what  we do in our house for special foods  like snacks special drinks and things
jLHoWtuGg2s,2279920,2286720,other people prepped if you didn't put  it on the grocery list you need to ask  whomever did if you didn't prep the food
jLHoWtuGg2s,2286720,2293520,then you need to ask etc otherwise you  find something you asked for or you  prepped or you make your own foods and
jLHoWtuGg2s,2293520,2300560,drinks there is no reason if he wants  sandwiches that he can't make sure the  ingredients are bought or make his own
jLHoWtuGg2s,2300560,2306000,there is no reason he should drink olive  a drink that he didn't request or that  he can't take a turn making a house
jLHoWtuGg2s,2306000,2312480,drink like tea when he starts the last  gallon  this is about respect if he can't
jLHoWtuGg2s,2312480,2319040,respect the time you spend making food  by helping out or keeping his hands off  then you as a household need to
jLHoWtuGg2s,2319040,2325599,renegotiate the food aspect of your  arrangement you didn't enter this  arrangement to be his mummies
jLHoWtuGg2s,2325599,2330640,and opie says i had to teach him step by  step how to make tea
jLHoWtuGg2s,2330640,2336480,tea  we have an iced tea maker you literally  fill the tea tank fill the pitcher half
jLHoWtuGg2s,2336480,2342240,with ice in half with water put tea bags  in the filter and press a button  he keeps saying he doesn't know how to
jLHoWtuGg2s,2342240,2348079,do things but also isn't willing to do  things and i am just so frustrated i
jLHoWtuGg2s,2348079,2354640,have no idea how straight women do this  when straight women mention lesbian  fantasies it's not always the sex
jLHoWtuGg2s,2354640,2362400,they're thinking of  i have heard that so many times oh wow  you're a lesbian lucky you you never
jLHoWtuGg2s,2362400,2367599,have to put up with your husbands or  boyfriends dot dot dot like huh
jLHoWtuGg2s,2367599,2372880,if you're dating men who let you down or  disappoint you  leave  there are wonderful and supportive and
jLHoWtuGg2s,2372880,2379200,helpful men out there but the fact that  those men often have to unlearn what  they're taught by their fathers or by
jLHoWtuGg2s,2379200,2385280,growing up as a man in general is just  sad to me  sounds just like having teenagers i
jLHoWtuGg2s,2385280,2391920,concur with all those who suggest no  more food splitting for the record my  husband always asks if i want the last
jLHoWtuGg2s,2391920,2397040,thing whether it be a yogurt french fry  or a bite of steak that's why i married
jLHoWtuGg2s,2397040,2402960,him  and opie says yeah i definitely wouldn't  marry this one he's the father of my
jLHoWtuGg2s,2402960,2408800,godson and my godson's mother is in  rehab i have a f all idea how she put up
jLHoWtuGg2s,2408800,2414400,with it i hope they stay separated but  not my circus not my monkeys once he
jLHoWtuGg2s,2414400,2420800,gets the hell out  and opie also goes on to say you're  really giving me a reality check i
jLHoWtuGg2s,2420800,2426319,needed  here i felt like a monster for thinking  that i couldn't keep up and since he was
jLHoWtuGg2s,2426319,2433359,paying it was fine i also don't think  he's paying nearly enough because it's  him and his one-year-olds the kid is our
jLHoWtuGg2s,2433359,2438560,godson  he's been boundary stomping for a while  but damn i thought i was being so
jLHoWtuGg2s,2438560,2445520,selfish here  it sounds like he's paying for half the  groceries but eating like 80 of them you
jLHoWtuGg2s,2445520,2452480,know what else he's not paying for  your time and expertise you were not  being selfish you gave him a place to
jLHoWtuGg2s,2452480,2457599,live not a full service hotel  heck do you know how expensive food is
jLHoWtuGg2s,2457599,2465119,at a hotel  endop says yeah he makes a lot of money  so in his brain it's easy he gives me
jLHoWtuGg2s,2465119,2470319,money to nanny for 10 hours a day every  day while the kid lives here and for his
jLHoWtuGg2s,2470319,2476800,portion of bills so expecting him to do  anything is shocking for him  he thinks he can throw money at things
jLHoWtuGg2s,2476800,2482000,but doesn't value our labor at all  well then he can start ordering his own
jLHoWtuGg2s,2482000,2487280,groceries via delivery and getting  takeout  money does solve a lot of problems but
jLHoWtuGg2s,2487280,2494079,you do not need to be the one to solve  them there is no reason for him to help  himself to food he didn't prepare and
jLHoWtuGg2s,2494079,2499200,he's a father  even more imperative he learned to do  all of this on his own
jLHoWtuGg2s,2499200,2504240,and opie says i have stories all day if  i went into how messy this has been
jLHoWtuGg2s,2504240,2511280,there is no telling where this kid would  have been without my wife and i he's a  single dad baby mama is in rehab which
jLHoWtuGg2s,2511280,2517040,is why we've had him his entire life  pretty much  it is so clear to me that he just never
jLHoWtuGg2s,2517040,2523359,bothered learning because his plan was  to make money and make the kids mom do  everything if he doesn't know how to do
jLHoWtuGg2s,2523359,2531280,something he just  won't do it  it doesn't even occur to him to try and  figure it out before asking us to do it
jLHoWtuGg2s,2531280,2536960,well you are women after all and that's  what we're here for yes two wives for
jLHoWtuGg2s,2536960,2542800,the price of one  oh my god  back up to the post we have an edit that
jLHoWtuGg2s,2542800,2548560,says i really thought when i wrote this  that i was being so selfish and  inconsiderate and just need to figure
jLHoWtuGg2s,2548560,2553599,out a better way to do this thank you  all for the reality check i needed it
jLHoWtuGg2s,2553599,2559760,i am reading every comment and sharing  these with my wife we've been dealing  with this for a year coming up in may
jLHoWtuGg2s,2559760,2565520,and it's been nothing but boundary  stopping the entire time  i have tried to have so so many
jLHoWtuGg2s,2565520,2571680,conversations with him about stuff but  he's gaslighting me to hell  he's got a move out date depending on
jLHoWtuGg2s,2571680,2578500,when he can get approved for a place and  i really need to take a long look at my  boundaries
jLHoWtuGg2s,2578500,2631019,[Music]
jLHoWtuGg2s,2637040,2643839,and now on to the update  hi mums  what a wake-up call in this original
jLHoWtuGg2s,2643839,2650720,post i truly thought i was the one at  fault and i didn't even consider what a  mindfuck situation i'd been manipulated
jLHoWtuGg2s,2650720,2656319,into  immediately after i got so much advice  on that post i did the following
jLHoWtuGg2s,2656319,2662960,we stopped doing his laundry prepping  his food and cleaning his dishes  eventually he ran out of dishes and
jLHoWtuGg2s,2662960,2668880,laundry and i think that was his oh crap  moment  we went on a cleaning strike and didn't
jLHoWtuGg2s,2668880,2674720,clean anything that he complained about  quickly making the house pretty gross  and not to his standards
jLHoWtuGg2s,2674720,2680640,we stopped buying him groceries he is  now having to cook for himself and it's  not going well
jLHoWtuGg2s,2680640,2687599,and the update is coming because  miraculously he got an apartment without  our help he will no longer be homeless
jLHoWtuGg2s,2687599,2694400,without me finding and calling and  sourcing living spaces he's got a  move-out date he's leaving
jLHoWtuGg2s,2694400,2699520,and he miraculously found a daycare and  pricing without my help and it's cheaper
jLHoWtuGg2s,2699520,2705359,than us so we get to have our own lives  back  all of y'all were right and the minute
jLHoWtuGg2s,2705359,2710560,we stopped being his housewife mother  slash maids he had to reckon with all we
jLHoWtuGg2s,2710560,2715680,do and immediately had a rude awakening  i cannot thank you all enough
jLHoWtuGg2s,2715680,2720720,i'll update again when we have our home  back but thank you i love all of you
jLHoWtuGg2s,2720720,2727119,to any of my little siblings reading  this the collective group of mums here  are amazing don't be afraid to reach out
jLHoWtuGg2s,2727119,2734240,you'll get gentle awakenings and advice  if you need it your big sister is here  for you lesson learned no one will ever
jLHoWtuGg2s,2734240,2740560,violate my boundaries like this again  thanks mums  ends now in the comments i have a
jLHoWtuGg2s,2740560,2746880,teenage boy active athletic how did you  outgrow the clothes we just bought  teenage boy
jLHoWtuGg2s,2746880,2754000,and he doesn't eat half of what this  grown man does he also knows how to cook  clean and do laundry for himself
jLHoWtuGg2s,2754000,2759920,my point that man is just an ass  i have seen far too many older women and
jLHoWtuGg2s,2759920,2766560,my peers raised their boys like they  were incompetent princes and then wonder  when they grow into teens and adults who
jLHoWtuGg2s,2766560,2772079,won't lift a finger around the house or  keep a relationship because these men go  on to try and make their significant
jLHoWtuGg2s,2772079,2778319,others into their maid  yet they wonder what's wrong with them  you can't raise them to be a catered to
jLHoWtuGg2s,2778319,2784960,man-child and then be shocked when  that's what they grow up to be  my boys are 15 and 12 and are always
jLHoWtuGg2s,2784960,2792000,shocked when their friends don't know  how to clean up after themselves or make  food  yeah i'm a guy who has wondered how so
jLHoWtuGg2s,2792000,2797040,many dudes i've known just cannot clean  up i hated living with men i'm not a
jLHoWtuGg2s,2797040,2802480,neat freak and my parents sucked but  they at least made sure that i knew how  to take out the trash and clean my ass
jLHoWtuGg2s,2802480,2809760,properly but i just say about every man  i ever lived with or even hung out with  didn't know or care to do basic cleaning
jLHoWtuGg2s,2809760,2817599,and it utterly perplexes me that this is  unusually common in my area  okay assuming between opie and wife eat
jLHoWtuGg2s,2817599,2826880,like eight uncrustables each across two  days that means this dude was still  eating 34 in two days is that possible
jLHoWtuGg2s,2826880,2832880,am i not comprehending something did i  math wrong  are they rooming with the party sub guy
jLHoWtuGg2s,2832880,2839599,i made a loaf worth of pbj sandwiches to  freeze when the supply chain took out  uncrustables after the first two months
jLHoWtuGg2s,2839599,2847040,of lockdown i was so over making  sandwiches every damn day and i would be  beyond pissed if it vanished that fast i
jLHoWtuGg2s,2847040,2853480,love cooking but bulk pbj making is  backache city
