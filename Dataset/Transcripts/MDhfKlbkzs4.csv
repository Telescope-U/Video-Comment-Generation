MDhfKlbkzs4,86090,89520,And I am in the position of the junior firefighter

MDhfKlbkzs4,151830,153575,in order to breath inside of a fire.

MDhfKlbkzs4,155070,157300,"- No, absolutely not."

MDhfKlbkzs4,162770,165680,And here is our high rise pack

MDhfKlbkzs4,167520,168420,- Wow. - Which is what we use

MDhfKlbkzs4,199255,201780,"Whoa, what's all this?"
MDhfKlbkzs4,201780,204550,"- So this is the way we control the water at a fire,"
MDhfKlbkzs4,204550,206930,this is our pump system here and our hose
MDhfKlbkzs4,206930,208972,where we get out hose from to go fight a fire.

MDhfKlbkzs4,219900,220930,to the fire hydrant here.
MDhfKlbkzs4,220930,223340,One end goes to the fire hydrant
MDhfKlbkzs4,223340,225670,and the other end hooks into the truck here
MDhfKlbkzs4,225670,228390,and that's were we get the water from to fight the fire.
MDhfKlbkzs4,228390,230890,"- Wow, so there's water already in the truck for this one?"
MDhfKlbkzs4,230890,232350,"- There is some to get started,"
MDhfKlbkzs4,232350,235380,but we need that fire hydrant to continue fighting the fire
MDhfKlbkzs4,235380,237060,"for long periods of time, so."
MDhfKlbkzs4,237060,238000,- Wow. - Yeah.
MDhfKlbkzs4,238000,238940,- How long is this hose?
MDhfKlbkzs4,238940,240898,It just keeps going and going and going.
