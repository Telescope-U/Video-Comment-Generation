xKg0C6g8UDg,658260,661110,however the Range Rover doesn't it's
xKg0C6g8UDg,661110,663000,electronic Terrain Response system can
xKg0C6g8UDg,663000,665070,still balance power of wail braking to
xKg0C6g8UDg,665070,666840,prevent its tyres from losing grip and

xKg0C6g8UDg,675630,677550,German starts lose traction if tires
xKg0C6g8UDg,677550,679290,spin up and this gives them more
xKg0C6g8UDg,679290,681240,composed and controlled Range Rover at
xKg0C6g8UDg,681240,683220,the chance to turn the tide it's clever
xKg0C6g8UDg,683220,684900,traction control system steadily
xKg0C6g8UDg,684900,687330,maintaining forward momentum and when he
xKg0C6g8UDg,687330,689310,combined this ability with the added
