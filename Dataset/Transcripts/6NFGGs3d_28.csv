6NFGGs3d_28,39600,42000,(Suvarnabhumi Airport)
6NFGGs3d_28,45000,46425,Mini hearts.
6NFGGs3d_28,56882,58678,"Mom, it's okay. I got this."
6NFGGs3d_28,60250,62250,See you later! We'll miss you.
6NFGGs3d_28,66000,67489,"Dad, mom, bye-bye!"
6NFGGs3d_28,67821,69579,Bye-bye!
6NFGGs3d_28,69996,72851,Our bags are 29-inches HUGE this time
6NFGGs3d_28,72851,74680,and it's so heavy!
6NFGGs3d_28,74680,78738,"Now we're at the airport, we'll have to take the ATK test "
6NFGGs3d_28,78738,81211,at Gate 7 or Gate 8.
6NFGGs3d_28,81301,86761,"The fee is 250 THB. Cheaper than the usual, which is 550 THB."
6NFGGs3d_28,86761,88099,But I'm not sure if it's going to be crowdy there.
6NFGGs3d_28,88099,93000,"The time is almost 7 PM, and our flight is 00:40 AM."
6NFGGs3d_28,93000,95383,"We came early to avoid the long line at the check-in counter,"
6NFGGs3d_28,95383,99221,to do the ATK test and to fill out the Q-CODE form.
6NFGGs3d_28,99221,101221,So basically we're 6-hours early.
6NFGGs3d_28,101723,104655,We just took the ATK test right there.
6NFGGs3d_28,104655,107932,"There weren't any queues when I arrived, but now the line is long!"
6NFGGs3d_28,108116,111405,"I think it was a pretty standard test, not that painful or anything."
6NFGGs3d_28,111405,113382,It's normal to get teary I guess? (ATK test 250 THB/With printable certification)
6NFGGs3d_28,113384,118180,"When we get the result, we'll move on to register the Q-CODE."
6NFGGs3d_28,118234,121996,Q-CODE is applying for an exception of quarantine in South Korea
6NFGGs3d_28,122108,128410, now that you can enter the country even if you're not vaccinated yet.
6NFGGs3d_28,128694,132967," You don't have to take an RT-CPR test, just an ATK test is fine."
6NFGGs3d_28,133009,136975,"But once you've arrived in South Korea, you have to do the test in 3 days,"
6NFGGs3d_28,136975,139843,so I've booked a SAFE2GO test at the airport there.
6NFGGs3d_28,140041,142599,"There were some reviews that said,"
6NFGGs3d_28,142599,145394,you can take a free test at local health centers there. 
6NFGGs3d_28,145461,148114,"But in fact, a tourist like us"
6NFGGs3d_28,148114,152552,who doesn't own a working or study permit VISA
6NFGGs3d_28,152704,155917,CAN'T take a free test like that! It's been announced by the government
6NFGGs3d_28,156001,159150,because there were some cases that took free tests and it's not right.
6NFGGs3d_28,159151,163015,Because it's only for the tax-paying Korean citizens
6NFGGs3d_28,163077,167310,so their government subsidies for this expense. This is not our right to do so.
6NFGGs3d_28,167710,172289,"For more details, I'll make a video for this topic specifically."
6NFGGs3d_28,172289,174429,But now let's wait for the result in 10 minutes.
6NFGGs3d_28,174957,178681," - Does it hurt? - This one does, the other doesn't."
6NFGGs3d_28,178753,181340,"I got a bloody nose from the flu, so embarrassed."
6NFGGs3d_28,181494,183277,- Really? a bloody nose you say? - Yeah. Right.
6NFGGs3d_28,183553,186905,We're all negative! The three of us.
6NFGGs3d_28,186906,189493,"If you want to do the test here, Make sure to check your document thoroughly."
6NFGGs3d_28,189549,191549,"They got my surname wrong,"
6NFGGs3d_28,191690,194571,"missing an ""I"". But it didn't take long to revise it."
6NFGGs3d_28,194572,198281,The test was pretty fast. It was mostly Koreans there
6NFGGs3d_28,198282,201000,since South Korea is one of the few countries that require the test.
6NFGGs3d_28,201081,203476,Now we're registering the Q-CODE here
6NFGGs3d_28,203478,207202,so that we can apply the test result  to get an exception of quarantine there.
6NFGGs3d_28,207457,210134,"- Is it Asia? - So it's up to me to fill these forms,  "
6NFGGs3d_28,210134,214943,"and these are my 1st and 2nd henchman,  taking charge of filming duty."
6NFGGs3d_28,214944,218897,"For Q-CODE, you can register only after you took the ATK test"
6NFGGs3d_28,218897,222365," which is also called the ""RAT"" test in South Korea."
6NFGGs3d_28,222366,226166,"Once you're done, they'll provide you with a QR Code"
6NFGGs3d_28,226166,230783,which can be used at the check-in counter. They'll ask if you registered the Q-CODE or not.
6NFGGs3d_28,230783,235311,"It's mandatory, to skip the quarantine process there."
6NFGGs3d_28,235311,237413," They gave me this, I'm not sure what it is though."
6NFGGs3d_28,237413,239200,- Maybe they just want to fill out these forms? - Simple as that?
6NFGGs3d_28,246801,248801,"Our gate is G3, this way."
6NFGGs3d_28,249355,253741,We're inside the terminal now.  The whole process took us around...
6NFGGs3d_28,253742,256457,"- How long? An hour, yes. - About an hour."
6NFGGs3d_28,256457,260461,We were there early so we didn't have to wait in line.
6NFGGs3d_28,260461,263661,Just expect the worse and spare some time for this process.
6NFGGs3d_28,263661,265904,"Anyway, we're looking for some food now."
6NFGGs3d_28,265904,270662,"These shops here are all open for business, just like a pre-COVID time."
6NFGGs3d_28,270662,272074,(Value set)
6NFGGs3d_28,272394,276560,It's a Dairy Queen party! This set is around 200 THB.
6NFGGs3d_28,293694,294928,It's like a maze in here.
6NFGGs3d_28,334206,336895,"We've arrived. OMG, my voice."
6NFGGs3d_28,338823,340823,"It's so dry in here, my voice!"
6NFGGs3d_28,340887,342000,This is bad!
6NFGGs3d_28,348857,352018,We all passed the immigration.
6NFGGs3d_28,352199,354199,There were some questions for us though.
6NFGGs3d_28,354200,356519,"But both times when Karn came here,  they didn't ask him a single question"
6NFGGs3d_28,356519,358880,They got stricter I guess? 
6NFGGs3d_28,358880,362501,I'm in Terminal 2 at the moment
6NFGGs3d_28,362616,366905,and I don't think there is any difference  between these terminals to be honest.
6NFGGs3d_28,367386,370931,"We're heading to the luggage claim,  we'll talk about the immigration process later."
6NFGGs3d_28,371402,376555,"Now we're waiting for the SIM card,  we've booked online with KKDAY and have to get it here."
6NFGGs3d_28,376641,381399,This is an unlimited SIM card with no data restriction.
6NFGGs3d_28,381910,387000,"You can buy a SIM2FLY card from Thailand,  I used it the last time I was here."
6NFGGs3d_28,387258,391288,But it's an 8 days trip this time. I don't think 6GB is enough.
6NFGGs3d_28,391288,396057,"So I bought from a Korean provider with KKDAY, for 900 THB each."
6NFGGs3d_28,396058,401812,"It's quite expensive, to be honest.  You can call, send SMS, "
6NFGGs3d_28,401917,407505,"and most importantly, the data usage is unlimited. You can use it as much as you want."
6NFGGs3d_28,407802,413836,"So when you passed the immigration,  you can collect it at Exits 2 and 3."
6NFGGs3d_28,413836,416054,"You will see a booth there, I'll leave the link in the description."
6NFGGs3d_28,416054,418922,Now we're going to take the RT-PCR test
6NFGGs3d_28,418922,423539,which I registered with SAFE2GO at 9:00 AM
6NFGGs3d_28,423540,426480,"but it passed that time already, let's hope for the best."
6NFGGs3d_28,426480,429208,"I think it's here, SAFE2GO"
6NFGGs3d_28,429208,430040,(SAFE2GO is an RT-PCR test reservation at Incheon Airport)
6NFGGs3d_28,430040,434397,I just took the test. I'm literally crying right now.
6NFGGs3d_28,434934,439551,"They swabbed only one side of my nasal,  but it was so DEEP! And they weren't gentle at all."
6NFGGs3d_28,439937,445231,The airport has several Testing Centers for each terminal 
6NFGGs3d_28,445232,450334,"one in Terminal 2, and two centers in Terminal 1. You can choose at your own convenience."
6NFGGs3d_28,450375,455374,"It cost 80,000 Won. You have to pay it yourself, cash is okay."
6NFGGs3d_28,455521,456525,I didn't even feel it.
6NFGGs3d_28,456525,459720,It was so painful for me. They went deep like BOOM!
6NFGGs3d_28,459907,464640,"I think they just swabbed around the outer part, but it's supposed to go deeper right?"
6NFGGs3d_28,464640,468325,"- They sure went DEEP in my case. - They did it so fast and I was like,"
6NFGGs3d_28,468394,472640,"perplexed. I can see your tears. And the staff just bye-bye me, just like that."
6NFGGs3d_28,478858,480858,"The first one, right? Select station."
6NFGGs3d_28,483355,486000,"We're heading to Hongik, can you find it?"
6NFGGs3d_28,486768,487862,Right there.
6NFGGs3d_28,492924,497503,"I'm using the ""Subway"" application to track the metro system."
6NFGGs3d_28,497724,502788,"You can check these stations, choose your destination,"
6NFGGs3d_28,502788,507891,from Terminal 2 to Hongik Station right here.
6NFGGs3d_28,507981,511759,"They'll give an estimation, of 59 minutes for 11 stations,"
6NFGGs3d_28,511852,514839,"and finally the expenses, 4,650 Won."
6NFGGs3d_28,536000,540000,This is where we live for the next 8 days.
6NFGGs3d_28,540492,544560,"There're 4 beds right here, 1-2-3-4, that's all."
6NFGGs3d_28,544561,546000,It's so small
6NFGGs3d_28,546000,556120,This is a separate shower room and a toilet right here.
6NFGGs3d_28,556280,565138,It's been sectioned. And this is a basin and a mirror right here.
6NFGGs3d_28,565800,570378,This is pretty much our whole room.
6NFGGs3d_28,570893,574897,It's so small! Are we going to live like this for the next 8 days !?
6NFGGs3d_28,574897,580191,This is a microwave and a mini fridge right here...  which is empty.
6NFGGs3d_28,580249,581432,So we have to fill it ourselves huh?
6NFGGs3d_28,582164,589720,These are the top bunk beds and the bottom.
6NFGGs3d_28,589954,591949,And that concludes our room tour. 
6NFGGs3d_28,591951,596555,"I chose this place because  I only made the reservation only 15 days in advance,"
6NFGGs3d_28,596716,602367,"not only that, but 8 days is a pretty long plan"
6NFGGs3d_28,602402,606738,so the place available at that time were quite limited.
6NFGGs3d_28,606739,611369,"Also, this place offers a good price in a nice location,"
6NFGGs3d_28,611369,616229,"around 2,600 THB a night. That's why I chose this place."
