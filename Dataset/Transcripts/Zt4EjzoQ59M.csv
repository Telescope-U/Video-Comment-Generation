Zt4EjzoQ59M,18640,20560,unfamiliar sight here sometimes it will
Zt4EjzoQ59M,20560,23279,pour for 20 30 minutes sometimes it goes
Zt4EjzoQ59M,23279,24880,all day it looks like an all-day type of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,24880,26480,rain right now today my plan is to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,26480,28400,experience the street food of this city
Zt4EjzoQ59M,28400,30000,street food here is very different than
Zt4EjzoQ59M,30000,32000,other places mexico they've got tons of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,32000,33680,street food actually out on the street
Zt4EjzoQ59M,33680,36000,same with vietnam but here in kigali
Zt4EjzoQ59M,36000,37440,it's a little bit more tucked away you
Zt4EjzoQ59M,37440,39360,have to go to street side shops maybe
Zt4EjzoQ59M,39360,41280,some outdoor market but it's not just
Zt4EjzoQ59M,41280,43120,out on the sidewalks like you see it in
Zt4EjzoQ59M,43120,44960,other places this morning i'm following
Zt4EjzoQ59M,44960,47440,aminata she is the owner of a shop she's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,47440,49280,a cook and we're gonna see her buy some
Zt4EjzoQ59M,49280,51120,food here at this market she's gonna

Zt4EjzoQ59M,52719,54079,up we're gonna try it out then we're
Zt4EjzoQ59M,54079,55760,gonna try as many other shops and as
Zt4EjzoQ59M,55760,57760,many other local foods that we can find
Zt4EjzoQ59M,57760,59199,i'm not sure what's in store so let's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,59199,61359,find out together
Zt4EjzoQ59M,61359,63760,let's go
Zt4EjzoQ59M,69439,71439,right now we are making sambusa with
Zt4EjzoQ59M,71439,73360,mary hi mary hi so you might be
Zt4EjzoQ59M,73360,74560,wondering what's the difference between
Zt4EjzoQ59M,74560,76640,samosa and sambusa and i think it just
Zt4EjzoQ59M,76640,78720,only depends on where you are i think
Zt4EjzoQ59M,78720,80400,the closer you are to india probably
Zt4EjzoQ59M,80400,82240,gonna hear samosa the closer you are to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,82240,84320,east africa you're gonna hear sambusa i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,84320,85759,know when i was in minnesota and i tried
Zt4EjzoQ59M,85759,87680,some somalian food and the somalian
Zt4EjzoQ59M,87680,89040,version it was called sambusa there
Zt4EjzoQ59M,89040,90640,right now she's making the vegetable
Zt4EjzoQ59M,90640,92640,version the filling there's peas there's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,92640,94400,carrots there's onions there's garlic
Zt4EjzoQ59M,94400,96640,tons of spices salt it smells incredible
Zt4EjzoQ59M,96640,98159,can i do that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,98159,99920,and chili too the filling is almost done
Zt4EjzoQ59M,99920,101759,soon that's going to go inside the wheat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,101759,102500,wrapper
Zt4EjzoQ59M,102500,106230,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,107040,108960,aminata is next to me she's showing us
Zt4EjzoQ59M,108960,110880,the delicate process of stuffing the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,110880,112720,sambusa what she does first she has kind
Zt4EjzoQ59M,112720,114560,of like an edible glue here made from
Zt4EjzoQ59M,114560,116479,wheat flour and water it's very sticky
Zt4EjzoQ59M,116479,118000,and it's gonna help it stay closed when
Zt4EjzoQ59M,118000,120079,it eventually gets fried inside here she
Zt4EjzoQ59M,120079,122240,makes a cone of happiness she stuffs it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,122240,123600,with all the different stuffings that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,123600,125770,have been cooked already
Zt4EjzoQ59M,125770,128160,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,128160,130399,tucks it in folds the flap glue it up
Zt4EjzoQ59M,130399,133599,and dan is ready to fry
Zt4EjzoQ59M,135220,140160,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,140160,142239,right here i have my sambusa freshly
Zt4EjzoQ59M,142239,144160,prepared freshly fried usually if you
Zt4EjzoQ59M,144160,145520,were getting these on the stream there's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,145520,146720,a good chance somebody might be making
Zt4EjzoQ59M,146720,148160,them at home and then bringing them out
Zt4EjzoQ59M,148160,150160,even yesterday i saw somebody by lake
Zt4EjzoQ59M,150160,151840,evil he had prepared a bunch of these
Zt4EjzoQ59M,151840,153360,and they just kind of hang out all day
Zt4EjzoQ59M,153360,154800,so it's rare that you get to eat them
Zt4EjzoQ59M,154800,156800,hot it looks incredible it's petite it's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,156800,158080,small i could probably eat seven of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,158080,161040,these let's go for it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,163840,165440,it's very satisfying especially when
Zt4EjzoQ59M,165440,166640,it's fresh and hot like that the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,166640,168400,vegetables are so well cooked together
Zt4EjzoQ59M,168400,169760,and it makes its own unique kind of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,169760,171599,veggie mash
Zt4EjzoQ59M,171599,173360,really hot but you need to embrace the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,173360,175200,hotness and there's such a blend of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,175200,177120,different spices here i taste cumin i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,177120,179120,taste the chili powder salt
Zt4EjzoQ59M,179120,180800,the maggi the local folks they love the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,180800,182800,maggie it is like an allspice i asked
Zt4EjzoQ59M,182800,184080,them if it was cheating they said
Zt4EjzoQ59M,184080,185519,absolutely not that's normal and good
Zt4EjzoQ59M,185519,187760,it's kind of like um vietnam has msg
Zt4EjzoQ59M,187760,189360,here they have maggie
Zt4EjzoQ59M,189360,190560,when you get to the corners you can
Zt4EjzoQ59M,190560,192159,really taste so much more of the bread
Zt4EjzoQ59M,192159,194000,you can see it's flaking crispy and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,194000,195760,still steaming hot usually the price for
Zt4EjzoQ59M,195760,197519,this is about 20 cents pretty good deal
Zt4EjzoQ59M,197519,199280,for a buck you could really fill up on a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,199280,201440,bunch of sambusa so this is kind of my
Zt4EjzoQ59M,201440,202720,breakfast for today but we have a lot
Zt4EjzoQ59M,202720,204290,more street food to find let's do it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,204290,207920,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,207920,210080,boom we are kind of near the walking
Zt4EjzoQ59M,210080,211920,street like hanging hangout night time
Zt4EjzoQ59M,211920,213760,area this is an area where vendors have
Zt4EjzoQ59M,213760,215760,been kind of approved to cook outside
Zt4EjzoQ59M,215760,217200,rather than just being located randomly
Zt4EjzoQ59M,217200,218560,all over the city this is a restaurant
Zt4EjzoQ59M,218560,219680,where they prepare something called
Zt4EjzoQ59M,219680,221840,pouchette very popular local street food
Zt4EjzoQ59M,221840,223599,all this is goat meat and they've taken
Zt4EjzoQ59M,223599,225040,every single piece of protein and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,225040,226239,they're cutting it into little bitty
Zt4EjzoQ59M,226239,228080,pieces that is going to go on a skewer
Zt4EjzoQ59M,228080,229280,and soon it's going to be grilled up
Zt4EjzoQ59M,229280,231360,this is the intestinal version this is
Zt4EjzoQ59M,231360,232879,one of the most unique preparations i've
Zt4EjzoQ59M,232879,234879,seen for goat intestines in my life he's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,234879,236480,kind of taken it he's wrapped it with
Zt4EjzoQ59M,236480,238400,some different types of leaves he's got
Zt4EjzoQ59M,238400,240480,layers of stomach intestine different
Zt4EjzoQ59M,240480,242560,internal organs it's just like a rope of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,242560,244400,different random innards this is ready
Zt4EjzoQ59M,244400,245760,for the next step the boiling and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,245760,247040,eventually it's all going to be grilled
Zt4EjzoQ59M,247040,249680,up and i'm going to try it out
Zt4EjzoQ59M,249680,251439,right now we are in the grilling station
Zt4EjzoQ59M,251439,253439,the bruchet has been brought here and i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,253439,254879,was wondering why the heck are they
Zt4EjzoQ59M,254879,256639,grilling inside until i realized we're
Zt4EjzoQ59M,256639,258320,not technically inside take a look up
Zt4EjzoQ59M,258320,259840,that's a rooftop that's a wall of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,259840,261199,another building that's a wall of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,261199,262639,another building and then they just kind
Zt4EjzoQ59M,262639,264400,of built a floor here anyways just cuz
Zt4EjzoQ59M,264400,266000,so we're technically outside and we're
Zt4EjzoQ59M,266000,267520,grilling outside here you can see the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,267520,269120,grill going what they do is they take
Zt4EjzoQ59M,269120,270720,the goat and marinate it with a little
Zt4EjzoQ59M,270720,272560,bit of ginger some soy sauce and then
Zt4EjzoQ59M,272560,274160,they intersperse the meat with some
Zt4EjzoQ59M,274160,275680,onion they put it on the grill it takes
Zt4EjzoQ59M,275680,278000,about 25-30 minutes and then that is
Zt4EjzoQ59M,278000,281320,ready to eat

Zt4EjzoQ59M,293440,295680,here some tea some meat and then some
Zt4EjzoQ59M,295680,297120,chapati right here i'm gonna try it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,297120,299790,without the chapati to begin with
Zt4EjzoQ59M,299790,302479,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,302479,304960,pretty well done on the end part
Zt4EjzoQ59M,304960,307199,the middle and the back very nice juicy
Zt4EjzoQ59M,307199,308960,super salty i love that they're using
Zt4EjzoQ59M,308960,310160,soy sauce i didn't know anybody in
Zt4EjzoQ59M,310160,311840,africa really used soy sauce i thought
Zt4EjzoQ59M,311840,314479,that was more of an asia thing
Zt4EjzoQ59M,314479,316320,it's goat so it tastes a bit goatee i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,316320,318000,gotta say the room we went back there
Zt4EjzoQ59M,318000,319440,usually in a dark back room like that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,319440,321280,you'd expect to see people counting
Zt4EjzoQ59M,321280,323199,money or weighing drugs but these guys
Zt4EjzoQ59M,323199,325039,were just chopping a goat into tiny
Zt4EjzoQ59M,325039,326400,little pieces the type of behavior i've
Zt4EjzoQ59M,326400,327759,not usually seen before i'm going to put
Zt4EjzoQ59M,327759,329759,this into the chapati not enough though
Zt4EjzoQ59M,329759,332080,more a double stack back-to-back meat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,332080,333230,try it out
Zt4EjzoQ59M,333230,335919,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,335919,337199,i don't know anybody in their right mind
Zt4EjzoQ59M,337199,338639,who doesn't like chapati it's very
Zt4EjzoQ59M,338639,340639,delicious i love it washed it down with
Zt4EjzoQ59M,340639,342160,some green tea
Zt4EjzoQ59M,342160,343759,so we're well into the day the problem
Zt4EjzoQ59M,343759,345440,is i really want to eat those intestines
Zt4EjzoQ59M,345440,347360,because they look gnarly but they take a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,347360,348639,long time to prepare they probably need
Zt4EjzoQ59M,348639,350400,to boil for another hour cool down
Zt4EjzoQ59M,350400,351440,eventually they're going to put them on
Zt4EjzoQ59M,351440,353199,sticks like this so i'm going to try to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,353199,355039,come back later in the day and then try
Zt4EjzoQ59M,355039,357280,out that incredible braid of random
Zt4EjzoQ59M,357280,358880,internal organs until then we got to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,358880,361680,find some more food

Zt4EjzoQ59M,476319,477759,flavoring chicken flavoring we're
Zt4EjzoQ59M,477759,479759,combining different animals essences and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,479759,481440,putting it into the pork and she's gonna
Zt4EjzoQ59M,481440,482860,put it in the oil right now
Zt4EjzoQ59M,482860,484560,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,484560,486879,a violent frying of the pork oh it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,486879,488560,smells incredible here's the problem we
Zt4EjzoQ59M,488560,490160,had to come to somebody's home because
Zt4EjzoQ59M,490160,492080,there are restaurants and bars who make
Zt4EjzoQ59M,492080,494000,this dish but they will not let you go
Zt4EjzoQ59M,494000,495919,into their kitchen to see it being made
Zt4EjzoQ59M,495919,497680,i think they're hiding something but
Zt4EjzoQ59M,497680,499680,here all is transparent all is in the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,499680,501440,open you can see exactly how the dish is
Zt4EjzoQ59M,501440,502800,made from beginning to end we've got
Zt4EjzoQ59M,502800,504479,some boiled pork here that's also being
Zt4EjzoQ59M,504479,506479,roasted well well done on some of those
Zt4EjzoQ59M,506479,507680,i think i'm distracting you too much
Zt4EjzoQ59M,507680,509759,it's a unique dish because pork is not
Zt4EjzoQ59M,509759,511680,super popular in rwanda but it seems
Zt4EjzoQ59M,511680,513279,like everybody knows this dish in
Zt4EjzoQ59M,513279,514800,particular and right now she's putting
Zt4EjzoQ59M,514800,517039,some sauce a beautiful marinade on top
Zt4EjzoQ59M,517039,520760,of the roasted pork
Zt4EjzoQ59M,521919,523599,the meal is almost ready we have a lot
Zt4EjzoQ59M,523599,524880,of separate different types of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,524880,526080,ingredients they're all going to go
Zt4EjzoQ59M,526080,527440,together on this platter this is like a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,527440,529120,local salad called kachumbari you can
Zt4EjzoQ59M,529120,530800,see there's delicious green bell peppers
Zt4EjzoQ59M,530800,532480,tomatoes onions carrots a little bit of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,532480,534240,cucumber which is unfortunate lime salt
Zt4EjzoQ59M,534240,535279,and then maybe something else in there
Zt4EjzoQ59M,535279,536800,but it looks quite fresh and delicious
Zt4EjzoQ59M,536800,539920,and it's a chili sauce here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,541200,543519,i almost got deceased it's little but
Zt4EjzoQ59M,543519,547560,it's potent like me
Zt4EjzoQ59M,553040,554320,this is very cool so many different
Zt4EjzoQ59M,554320,556160,options here right here fried yellow
Zt4EjzoQ59M,556160,558000,bananas oh
Zt4EjzoQ59M,558000,559920,oh it's really good i believe the heat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,559920,561839,has brought out even more sweetness and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,561839,563360,the oil has done something magical here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,563360,564640,there's that but there's other types of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,564640,566320,bananas here too this one was a green
Zt4EjzoQ59M,566320,569279,one that's simply been roasted
Zt4EjzoQ59M,569279,571360,but smoky starchy more like potatoey
Zt4EjzoQ59M,571360,572800,it's not as good as the first one here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,572800,574640,another sweet yellow banana cheese has
Zt4EjzoQ59M,574640,576380,plantain that has been grilled
Zt4EjzoQ59M,576380,579279,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,579279,580959,what doesn't even taste like a banana
Zt4EjzoQ59M,580959,583600,that's so bizarre what's going on
Zt4EjzoQ59M,583600,585760,it's like 20 tangerine that has such a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,585760,588560,weird taste to it here try it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,588560,589850,does that taste like a banana
Zt4EjzoQ59M,589850,591760,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,591760,593440,she or he
Zt4EjzoQ59M,593440,594959,said no it's my wife so that is the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,594959,596640,fruit section i'm dying to try this meat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,596640,598800,i've been in africa now for two months
Zt4EjzoQ59M,598800,600880,most dishes are beef there's tons of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,600880,603120,goat there's mutton but fried pork like
Zt4EjzoQ59M,603120,604640,this it reminds me of something i'd find
Zt4EjzoQ59M,604640,606480,in asia i miss asia i haven't been there
Zt4EjzoQ59M,606480,607680,for seven months i think i'm going to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,607680,609290,enjoy it here we go
Zt4EjzoQ59M,609290,611440,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,611440,612720,there's normally gonna hit my lips when
Zt4EjzoQ59M,612720,615120,i know it's crunchy slightly dry but i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,615120,616800,think the fresher you eat it the less
Zt4EjzoQ59M,616800,618160,dry it's going to be even here check
Zt4EjzoQ59M,618160,619920,this off i got some meat stuck to a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,619920,622480,piece of bone oh yeah
Zt4EjzoQ59M,622480,624320,the seasoning is very nice it is a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,624320,626000,multitude of flavors and i like that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,626000,627519,even though it's a pig she put b
Zt4EjzoQ59M,627519,629120,seasoning and chicken seasoning it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,629120,630320,sounds like that's against the bible
Zt4EjzoQ59M,630320,632320,probably but she's doing it blasphemous
Zt4EjzoQ59M,632320,634000,as it might be that is excellent right
Zt4EjzoQ59M,634000,636160,here this is boiled and then roasted
Zt4EjzoQ59M,636160,638000,there's a nice piece nice amount of fat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,638000,640000,in there it looks juicy more roasted and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,640000,641680,crisp on the outside
Zt4EjzoQ59M,641680,643440,a little different flavor overall i do
Zt4EjzoQ59M,643440,645279,slightly prefer the fried one pork
Zt4EjzoQ59M,645279,647360,cooked three ways super seasoned it is a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,647360,648959,joy to have some pork right now here in
Zt4EjzoQ59M,648959,650640,africa but that is still a bit heavy a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,650640,652240,bit oily and i think the way to cut that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,652240,654079,is with this local salad this is
Zt4EjzoQ59M,654079,657040,kombariachi
Zt4EjzoQ59M,657279,660720,i've never said it right once try it out
Zt4EjzoQ59M,660720,662880,fresh tomato green onion habanero it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,662880,664320,definitely has some kick a little bit of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,664320,666000,cucumber but as soon as you're like ew
Zt4EjzoQ59M,666000,667760,cucumber then the habanero punches you
Zt4EjzoQ59M,667760,668959,in the face and you forget about that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,668959,670079,i'm gonna cool myself down with some
Zt4EjzoQ59M,670079,672160,avocado
Zt4EjzoQ59M,672160,674320,this whole platter right here 12 that's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,674320,675519,pretty good this could feed a small
Zt4EjzoQ59M,675519,676959,family what i want to do next i want to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,676959,678079,take another piece here i'm gonna put
Zt4EjzoQ59M,678079,679440,some of that habanero on there oh i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,679440,681680,can't wait to regret this and to be safe
Zt4EjzoQ59M,681680,683440,i'm gonna cover that with an avocado all
Zt4EjzoQ59M,683440,685120,right the ultimate bite all at once here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,685120,688279,we go
Zt4EjzoQ59M,689760,691839,love it excellent so this is akka benz
Zt4EjzoQ59M,691839,693040,something i've not seen in any other
Zt4EjzoQ59M,693040,694640,country i know it is pretty unique here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,694640,696000,in the country of rwanda there's not a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,696000,697200,ton of places where you can get it and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,697200,699040,like i said very few places will you be
Zt4EjzoQ59M,699040,700560,able to see how they make it but today
Zt4EjzoQ59M,700560,702160,we got to peek behind the aka ben's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,702160,703920,curtain and i am not disappointed from
Zt4EjzoQ59M,703920,704950,here we need more food
Zt4EjzoQ59M,704950,709760,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,709760,711839,it is now night time we've come back to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,711839,713360,the place we were previously serving the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,713360,715600,brucette we had the kind of just normal
Zt4EjzoQ59M,715600,717519,meat version very boring compared to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,717519,718959,this this is the intestines that have
Zt4EjzoQ59M,718959,720720,been all spindled and braided and wound
Zt4EjzoQ59M,720720,722399,up they boiled it for a long time they
Zt4EjzoQ59M,722399,723920,put it in the freezer for a little bit
Zt4EjzoQ59M,723920,726800,so it will hold and stay firm as they do
Zt4EjzoQ59M,726800,728639,the next step sir take it away so what
Zt4EjzoQ59M,728639,730160,he's going to do is basically cut this
Zt4EjzoQ59M,730160,732079,beautiful braid into medallions those
Zt4EjzoQ59M,732079,733600,medallions are going to get stuck on a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,733600,735120,skewer and that's going to hit the grill
Zt4EjzoQ59M,735120,736959,in just a little bit if you look inside
Zt4EjzoQ59M,736959,738720,you can see different layers of fat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,738720,740720,stomach intestine some of the vegetable
Zt4EjzoQ59M,740720,742320,that was in there all of that just
Zt4EjzoQ59M,742320,743920,almost like a sausage made out of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,743920,745839,braided internal organs he's going to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,745839,747360,continue working on this and then soon
Zt4EjzoQ59M,747360,748399,that's going to hit the grill and we're
Zt4EjzoQ59M,748399,750880,going to try it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,751110,756839,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,756839,760160,out this is the only street food area it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,760160,762079,seems that in rwanda it's kind of part
Zt4EjzoQ59M,762079,763920,of the culture that you eat inside every
Zt4EjzoQ59M,763920,765600,time you've seen us eat or cook outside
Zt4EjzoQ59M,765600,767200,it's been usually upon my special
Zt4EjzoQ59M,767200,769120,request because of lighting issues so
Zt4EjzoQ59M,769120,770480,this is kind of a new thing they've got
Zt4EjzoQ59M,770480,772399,this walking street no cars allowed
Zt4EjzoQ59M,772399,774079,people come here they hang out they get
Zt4EjzoQ59M,774079,775600,some street food and they actually eat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,775600,777920,outside they have a menu but it's a very
Zt4EjzoQ59M,777920,779600,limited menu but a fun place for people
Zt4EjzoQ59M,779600,781120,to come and hang out which leads me to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,781120,782880,my next topic this it's not like i'm
Zt4EjzoQ59M,782880,784240,against intestine the only thing that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,784240,786079,throws me off was the smell of the room
Zt4EjzoQ59M,786079,787440,that we were in as they were preparing
Zt4EjzoQ59M,787440,789040,this to be fair instead of a cutting
Zt4EjzoQ59M,789040,790800,board they were using like a desk like
Zt4EjzoQ59M,790800,792480,your school teacher had you'd be working
Zt4EjzoQ59M,792480,793760,and they'd be grading papers in the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,793760,795680,corner imagine instead of grading papers
Zt4EjzoQ59M,795680,797440,they're cutting up a whole goat that's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,797440,798959,what they're doing on that desk every
Zt4EjzoQ59M,798959,800410,day multiple times a day cheers
Zt4EjzoQ59M,800410,805519,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,805519,807360,your body
Zt4EjzoQ59M,807360,808800,all right what a relief i didn't know
Zt4EjzoQ59M,808800,810160,what to expect that might be super
Zt4EjzoQ59M,810160,812240,gaming i thought it could be a bit funky
Zt4EjzoQ59M,812240,814399,but i think that fire has cleansed this
Zt4EjzoQ59M,814399,816320,animal of any badness that might have
Zt4EjzoQ59M,816320,817200,been there it's got a little bit of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,817200,819120,goaty funk but overall it's good it's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,819120,821040,fatty it's juicy it's smoky from the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,821040,822800,charcoal i kind of like it i can see why
Zt4EjzoQ59M,822800,824079,you might want this you know it's a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,824079,825120,different kind of texture and a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,825120,826560,different experience than just eating
Zt4EjzoQ59M,826560,828320,the protein itself get some chapati
Zt4EjzoQ59M,828320,829839,there we go i'm feeling naughty with my

Zt4EjzoQ59M,833680,834880,heart i was like this is going to be a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,834880,837839,disaster and it's pretty dang good
Zt4EjzoQ59M,837839,839760,this is the end of our rwanda series
Zt4EjzoQ59M,839760,841600,what did i learn rwanda is a fascinating
Zt4EjzoQ59M,841600,843519,country very safe very clean many many
Zt4EjzoQ59M,843519,846160,hills and a huge diversity in approaches
Zt4EjzoQ59M,846160,848160,to cooking street food not every culture
Zt4EjzoQ59M,848160,850079,not every country is a street food
Zt4EjzoQ59M,850079,851839,country i love street food but here you
Zt4EjzoQ59M,851839,853680,have to be a little bit more crafty you

Zt4EjzoQ59M,855519,857519,and find the street food type food when
Zt4EjzoQ59M,857519,859199,i came to rwanda maybe i knew what
Zt4EjzoQ59M,859199,860639,people had heard about rwanda in
Zt4EjzoQ59M,860639,862480,headlines or in the news but coming here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,862480,864399,it is a very unique beautiful and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,864399,866000,interesting place i think three days was

Zt4EjzoQ59M,14080,16320,today we are in the capital kigali here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,16320,18640,it is raining like crazy this is not an
Zt4EjzoQ59M,18640,20560,unfamiliar sight here sometimes it will
Zt4EjzoQ59M,20560,23279,pour for 20 30 minutes sometimes it goes
Zt4EjzoQ59M,23279,24880,all day it looks like an all-day type of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,24880,26480,rain right now today my plan is to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,26480,28400,experience the street food of this city
Zt4EjzoQ59M,28400,30000,street food here is very different than
Zt4EjzoQ59M,30000,32000,other places mexico they've got tons of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,32000,33680,street food actually out on the street
Zt4EjzoQ59M,33680,36000,same with vietnam but here in kigali
Zt4EjzoQ59M,36000,37440,it's a little bit more tucked away you
Zt4EjzoQ59M,37440,39360,have to go to street side shops maybe
Zt4EjzoQ59M,39360,41280,some outdoor market but it's not just
Zt4EjzoQ59M,41280,43120,out on the sidewalks like you see it in

Zt4EjzoQ59M,55760,57760,many other local foods that we can find
Zt4EjzoQ59M,57760,59199,i'm not sure what's in store so let's

Zt4EjzoQ59M,71439,73360,mary hi mary hi so you might be
Zt4EjzoQ59M,73360,74560,wondering what's the difference between
Zt4EjzoQ59M,74560,76640,samosa and sambusa and i think it just
Zt4EjzoQ59M,76640,78720,only depends on where you are i think
Zt4EjzoQ59M,78720,80400,the closer you are to india probably
Zt4EjzoQ59M,80400,82240,gonna hear samosa the closer you are to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,82240,84320,east africa you're gonna hear sambusa i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,84320,85759,know when i was in minnesota and i tried
Zt4EjzoQ59M,85759,87680,some somalian food and the somalian
Zt4EjzoQ59M,87680,89040,version it was called sambusa there
Zt4EjzoQ59M,89040,90640,right now she's making the vegetable
Zt4EjzoQ59M,90640,92640,version the filling there's peas there's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,92640,94400,carrots there's onions there's garlic
Zt4EjzoQ59M,94400,96640,tons of spices salt it smells incredible

Zt4EjzoQ59M,98159,99920,and chili too the filling is almost done
Zt4EjzoQ59M,99920,101759,soon that's going to go inside the wheat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,101759,102500,wrapper
Zt4EjzoQ59M,102500,106230,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,107040,108960,aminata is next to me she's showing us
Zt4EjzoQ59M,108960,110880,the delicate process of stuffing the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,110880,112720,sambusa what she does first she has kind
Zt4EjzoQ59M,112720,114560,of like an edible glue here made from
Zt4EjzoQ59M,114560,116479,wheat flour and water it's very sticky
Zt4EjzoQ59M,116479,118000,and it's gonna help it stay closed when
Zt4EjzoQ59M,118000,120079,it eventually gets fried inside here she
Zt4EjzoQ59M,120079,122240,makes a cone of happiness she stuffs it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,122240,123600,with all the different stuffings that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,123600,125770,have been cooked already
Zt4EjzoQ59M,125770,128160,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,128160,130399,tucks it in folds the flap glue it up
Zt4EjzoQ59M,130399,133599,and dan is ready to fry
Zt4EjzoQ59M,135220,140160,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,140160,142239,right here i have my sambusa freshly
Zt4EjzoQ59M,142239,144160,prepared freshly fried usually if you
Zt4EjzoQ59M,144160,145520,were getting these on the stream there's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,145520,146720,a good chance somebody might be making
Zt4EjzoQ59M,146720,148160,them at home and then bringing them out
Zt4EjzoQ59M,148160,150160,even yesterday i saw somebody by lake
Zt4EjzoQ59M,150160,151840,evil he had prepared a bunch of these
Zt4EjzoQ59M,151840,153360,and they just kind of hang out all day
Zt4EjzoQ59M,153360,154800,so it's rare that you get to eat them
Zt4EjzoQ59M,154800,156800,hot it looks incredible it's petite it's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,156800,158080,small i could probably eat seven of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,158080,161040,these let's go for it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,163840,165440,it's very satisfying especially when
Zt4EjzoQ59M,165440,166640,it's fresh and hot like that the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,166640,168400,vegetables are so well cooked together
Zt4EjzoQ59M,168400,169760,and it makes its own unique kind of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,169760,171599,veggie mash
Zt4EjzoQ59M,171599,173360,really hot but you need to embrace the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,173360,175200,hotness and there's such a blend of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,175200,177120,different spices here i taste cumin i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,177120,179120,taste the chili powder salt
Zt4EjzoQ59M,179120,180800,the maggi the local folks they love the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,180800,182800,maggie it is like an allspice i asked
Zt4EjzoQ59M,182800,184080,them if it was cheating they said
Zt4EjzoQ59M,184080,185519,absolutely not that's normal and good
Zt4EjzoQ59M,185519,187760,it's kind of like um vietnam has msg
Zt4EjzoQ59M,187760,189360,here they have maggie
Zt4EjzoQ59M,189360,190560,when you get to the corners you can
Zt4EjzoQ59M,190560,192159,really taste so much more of the bread
Zt4EjzoQ59M,192159,194000,you can see it's flaking crispy and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,194000,195760,still steaming hot usually the price for
Zt4EjzoQ59M,195760,197519,this is about 20 cents pretty good deal
Zt4EjzoQ59M,197519,199280,for a buck you could really fill up on a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,199280,201440,bunch of sambusa so this is kind of my
Zt4EjzoQ59M,201440,202720,breakfast for today but we have a lot
Zt4EjzoQ59M,202720,204290,more street food to find let's do it

Zt4EjzoQ59M,211920,213760,area this is an area where vendors have
Zt4EjzoQ59M,213760,215760,been kind of approved to cook outside
Zt4EjzoQ59M,215760,217200,rather than just being located randomly
Zt4EjzoQ59M,217200,218560,all over the city this is a restaurant
Zt4EjzoQ59M,218560,219680,where they prepare something called
Zt4EjzoQ59M,219680,221840,pouchette very popular local street food
Zt4EjzoQ59M,221840,223599,all this is goat meat and they've taken
Zt4EjzoQ59M,223599,225040,every single piece of protein and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,225040,226239,they're cutting it into little bitty
Zt4EjzoQ59M,226239,228080,pieces that is going to go on a skewer
Zt4EjzoQ59M,228080,229280,and soon it's going to be grilled up
Zt4EjzoQ59M,229280,231360,this is the intestinal version this is
Zt4EjzoQ59M,231360,232879,one of the most unique preparations i've

Zt4EjzoQ59M,240480,242560,internal organs it's just like a rope of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,242560,244400,different random innards this is ready
Zt4EjzoQ59M,244400,245760,for the next step the boiling and

Zt4EjzoQ59M,251439,253439,the bruchet has been brought here and i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,253439,254879,was wondering why the heck are they
Zt4EjzoQ59M,254879,256639,grilling inside until i realized we're
Zt4EjzoQ59M,256639,258320,not technically inside take a look up
Zt4EjzoQ59M,258320,259840,that's a rooftop that's a wall of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,259840,261199,another building that's a wall of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,261199,262639,another building and then they just kind
Zt4EjzoQ59M,262639,264400,of built a floor here anyways just cuz
Zt4EjzoQ59M,264400,266000,so we're technically outside and we're
Zt4EjzoQ59M,266000,267520,grilling outside here you can see the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,267520,269120,grill going what they do is they take
Zt4EjzoQ59M,269120,270720,the goat and marinate it with a little
Zt4EjzoQ59M,270720,272560,bit of ginger some soy sauce and then
Zt4EjzoQ59M,272560,274160,they intersperse the meat with some
Zt4EjzoQ59M,274160,275680,onion they put it on the grill it takes
Zt4EjzoQ59M,275680,278000,about 25-30 minutes and then that is
Zt4EjzoQ59M,278000,281320,ready to eat

Zt4EjzoQ59M,295680,297120,chapati right here i'm gonna try it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,297120,299790,without the chapati to begin with
Zt4EjzoQ59M,299790,302479,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,302479,304960,pretty well done on the end part
Zt4EjzoQ59M,304960,307199,the middle and the back very nice juicy
Zt4EjzoQ59M,307199,308960,super salty i love that they're using
Zt4EjzoQ59M,308960,310160,soy sauce i didn't know anybody in
Zt4EjzoQ59M,310160,311840,africa really used soy sauce i thought
Zt4EjzoQ59M,311840,314479,that was more of an asia thing
Zt4EjzoQ59M,314479,316320,it's goat so it tastes a bit goatee i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,316320,318000,gotta say the room we went back there
Zt4EjzoQ59M,318000,319440,usually in a dark back room like that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,319440,321280,you'd expect to see people counting
Zt4EjzoQ59M,321280,323199,money or weighing drugs but these guys
Zt4EjzoQ59M,323199,325039,were just chopping a goat into tiny
Zt4EjzoQ59M,325039,326400,little pieces the type of behavior i've
Zt4EjzoQ59M,326400,327759,not usually seen before i'm going to put
Zt4EjzoQ59M,327759,329759,this into the chapati not enough though
Zt4EjzoQ59M,329759,332080,more a double stack back-to-back meat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,332080,333230,try it out
Zt4EjzoQ59M,333230,335919,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,335919,337199,i don't know anybody in their right mind
Zt4EjzoQ59M,337199,338639,who doesn't like chapati it's very
Zt4EjzoQ59M,338639,340639,delicious i love it washed it down with
Zt4EjzoQ59M,340639,342160,some green tea
Zt4EjzoQ59M,342160,343759,so we're well into the day the problem
Zt4EjzoQ59M,343759,345440,is i really want to eat those intestines
Zt4EjzoQ59M,345440,347360,because they look gnarly but they take a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,347360,348639,long time to prepare they probably need
Zt4EjzoQ59M,348639,350400,to boil for another hour cool down
Zt4EjzoQ59M,350400,351440,eventually they're going to put them on
Zt4EjzoQ59M,351440,353199,sticks like this so i'm going to try to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,353199,355039,come back later in the day and then try
Zt4EjzoQ59M,355039,357280,out that incredible braid of random
Zt4EjzoQ59M,357280,358880,internal organs until then we got to

Zt4EjzoQ59M,472160,474000,it's been boiled already she's put a ton
Zt4EjzoQ59M,474000,476319,of spices on there turmeric paprika beef
Zt4EjzoQ59M,476319,477759,flavoring chicken flavoring we're

Zt4EjzoQ59M,484560,486879,a violent frying of the pork oh it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,486879,488560,smells incredible here's the problem we
Zt4EjzoQ59M,488560,490160,had to come to somebody's home because
Zt4EjzoQ59M,490160,492080,there are restaurants and bars who make
Zt4EjzoQ59M,492080,494000,this dish but they will not let you go
Zt4EjzoQ59M,494000,495919,into their kitchen to see it being made
Zt4EjzoQ59M,495919,497680,i think they're hiding something but

Zt4EjzoQ59M,507680,509759,it's a unique dish because pork is not
Zt4EjzoQ59M,509759,511680,super popular in rwanda but it seems
Zt4EjzoQ59M,511680,513279,like everybody knows this dish in

Zt4EjzoQ59M,517039,520760,of the roasted pork
Zt4EjzoQ59M,521919,523599,the meal is almost ready we have a lot
Zt4EjzoQ59M,523599,524880,of separate different types of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,524880,526080,ingredients they're all going to go
Zt4EjzoQ59M,526080,527440,together on this platter this is like a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,527440,529120,local salad called kachumbari you can
Zt4EjzoQ59M,529120,530800,see there's delicious green bell peppers
Zt4EjzoQ59M,530800,532480,tomatoes onions carrots a little bit of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,532480,534240,cucumber which is unfortunate lime salt
Zt4EjzoQ59M,534240,535279,and then maybe something else in there
Zt4EjzoQ59M,535279,536800,but it looks quite fresh and delicious
Zt4EjzoQ59M,536800,539920,and it's a chili sauce here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,541200,543519,i almost got deceased it's little but
Zt4EjzoQ59M,543519,547560,it's potent like me
Zt4EjzoQ59M,553040,554320,this is very cool so many different
Zt4EjzoQ59M,554320,556160,options here right here fried yellow
Zt4EjzoQ59M,556160,558000,bananas oh
Zt4EjzoQ59M,558000,559920,oh it's really good i believe the heat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,559920,561839,has brought out even more sweetness and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,561839,563360,the oil has done something magical here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,563360,564640,there's that but there's other types of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,564640,566320,bananas here too this one was a green
Zt4EjzoQ59M,566320,569279,one that's simply been roasted
Zt4EjzoQ59M,569279,571360,but smoky starchy more like potatoey
Zt4EjzoQ59M,571360,572800,it's not as good as the first one here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,572800,574640,another sweet yellow banana cheese has
Zt4EjzoQ59M,574640,576380,plantain that has been grilled
Zt4EjzoQ59M,576380,579279,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,579279,580959,what doesn't even taste like a banana
Zt4EjzoQ59M,580959,583600,that's so bizarre what's going on
Zt4EjzoQ59M,583600,585760,it's like 20 tangerine that has such a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,585760,588560,weird taste to it here try it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,588560,589850,does that taste like a banana
Zt4EjzoQ59M,589850,591760,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,591760,593440,she or he
Zt4EjzoQ59M,593440,594959,said no it's my wife so that is the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,594959,596640,fruit section i'm dying to try this meat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,596640,598800,i've been in africa now for two months
Zt4EjzoQ59M,598800,600880,most dishes are beef there's tons of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,600880,603120,goat there's mutton but fried pork like
Zt4EjzoQ59M,603120,604640,this it reminds me of something i'd find
Zt4EjzoQ59M,604640,606480,in asia i miss asia i haven't been there
Zt4EjzoQ59M,606480,607680,for seven months i think i'm going to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,607680,609290,enjoy it here we go
Zt4EjzoQ59M,609290,611440,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,611440,612720,there's normally gonna hit my lips when
Zt4EjzoQ59M,612720,615120,i know it's crunchy slightly dry but i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,615120,616800,think the fresher you eat it the less
Zt4EjzoQ59M,616800,618160,dry it's going to be even here check
Zt4EjzoQ59M,618160,619920,this off i got some meat stuck to a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,619920,622480,piece of bone oh yeah
Zt4EjzoQ59M,622480,624320,the seasoning is very nice it is a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,624320,626000,multitude of flavors and i like that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,626000,627519,even though it's a pig she put b
Zt4EjzoQ59M,627519,629120,seasoning and chicken seasoning it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,629120,630320,sounds like that's against the bible
Zt4EjzoQ59M,630320,632320,probably but she's doing it blasphemous
Zt4EjzoQ59M,632320,634000,as it might be that is excellent right
Zt4EjzoQ59M,634000,636160,here this is boiled and then roasted
Zt4EjzoQ59M,636160,638000,there's a nice piece nice amount of fat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,638000,640000,in there it looks juicy more roasted and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,640000,641680,crisp on the outside
Zt4EjzoQ59M,641680,643440,a little different flavor overall i do
Zt4EjzoQ59M,643440,645279,slightly prefer the fried one pork
Zt4EjzoQ59M,645279,647360,cooked three ways super seasoned it is a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,647360,648959,joy to have some pork right now here in
Zt4EjzoQ59M,648959,650640,africa but that is still a bit heavy a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,650640,652240,bit oily and i think the way to cut that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,652240,654079,is with this local salad this is
Zt4EjzoQ59M,654079,657040,kombariachi
Zt4EjzoQ59M,657279,660720,i've never said it right once try it out
Zt4EjzoQ59M,660720,662880,fresh tomato green onion habanero it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,662880,664320,definitely has some kick a little bit of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,664320,666000,cucumber but as soon as you're like ew
Zt4EjzoQ59M,666000,667760,cucumber then the habanero punches you
Zt4EjzoQ59M,667760,668959,in the face and you forget about that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,668959,670079,i'm gonna cool myself down with some
Zt4EjzoQ59M,670079,672160,avocado
Zt4EjzoQ59M,672160,674320,this whole platter right here 12 that's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,674320,675519,pretty good this could feed a small
Zt4EjzoQ59M,675519,676959,family what i want to do next i want to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,676959,678079,take another piece here i'm gonna put
Zt4EjzoQ59M,678079,679440,some of that habanero on there oh i
Zt4EjzoQ59M,679440,681680,can't wait to regret this and to be safe
Zt4EjzoQ59M,681680,683440,i'm gonna cover that with an avocado all
Zt4EjzoQ59M,683440,685120,right the ultimate bite all at once here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,685120,688279,we go
Zt4EjzoQ59M,689760,691839,love it excellent so this is akka benz
Zt4EjzoQ59M,691839,693040,something i've not seen in any other
Zt4EjzoQ59M,693040,694640,country i know it is pretty unique here
Zt4EjzoQ59M,694640,696000,in the country of rwanda there's not a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,696000,697200,ton of places where you can get it and
Zt4EjzoQ59M,697200,699040,like i said very few places will you be
Zt4EjzoQ59M,699040,700560,able to see how they make it but today
Zt4EjzoQ59M,700560,702160,we got to peek behind the aka ben's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,702160,703920,curtain and i am not disappointed from
Zt4EjzoQ59M,703920,704950,here we need more food
Zt4EjzoQ59M,704950,709760,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,709760,711839,it is now night time we've come back to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,711839,713360,the place we were previously serving the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,713360,715600,brucette we had the kind of just normal
Zt4EjzoQ59M,715600,717519,meat version very boring compared to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,717519,718959,this this is the intestines that have
Zt4EjzoQ59M,718959,720720,been all spindled and braided and wound
Zt4EjzoQ59M,720720,722399,up they boiled it for a long time they
Zt4EjzoQ59M,722399,723920,put it in the freezer for a little bit
Zt4EjzoQ59M,723920,726800,so it will hold and stay firm as they do
Zt4EjzoQ59M,726800,728639,the next step sir take it away so what
Zt4EjzoQ59M,728639,730160,he's going to do is basically cut this
Zt4EjzoQ59M,730160,732079,beautiful braid into medallions those
Zt4EjzoQ59M,732079,733600,medallions are going to get stuck on a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,733600,735120,skewer and that's going to hit the grill
Zt4EjzoQ59M,735120,736959,in just a little bit if you look inside
Zt4EjzoQ59M,736959,738720,you can see different layers of fat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,738720,740720,stomach intestine some of the vegetable
Zt4EjzoQ59M,740720,742320,that was in there all of that just
Zt4EjzoQ59M,742320,743920,almost like a sausage made out of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,743920,745839,braided internal organs he's going to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,745839,747360,continue working on this and then soon
Zt4EjzoQ59M,747360,748399,that's going to hit the grill and we're
Zt4EjzoQ59M,748399,750880,going to try it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,751110,756839,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,756839,760160,out this is the only street food area it
Zt4EjzoQ59M,760160,762079,seems that in rwanda it's kind of part
Zt4EjzoQ59M,762079,763920,of the culture that you eat inside every
Zt4EjzoQ59M,763920,765600,time you've seen us eat or cook outside
Zt4EjzoQ59M,765600,767200,it's been usually upon my special
Zt4EjzoQ59M,767200,769120,request because of lighting issues so
Zt4EjzoQ59M,769120,770480,this is kind of a new thing they've got
Zt4EjzoQ59M,770480,772399,this walking street no cars allowed
Zt4EjzoQ59M,772399,774079,people come here they hang out they get
Zt4EjzoQ59M,774079,775600,some street food and they actually eat
Zt4EjzoQ59M,775600,777920,outside they have a menu but it's a very
Zt4EjzoQ59M,777920,779600,limited menu but a fun place for people
Zt4EjzoQ59M,779600,781120,to come and hang out which leads me to
Zt4EjzoQ59M,781120,782880,my next topic this it's not like i'm
Zt4EjzoQ59M,782880,784240,against intestine the only thing that
Zt4EjzoQ59M,784240,786079,throws me off was the smell of the room
Zt4EjzoQ59M,786079,787440,that we were in as they were preparing
Zt4EjzoQ59M,787440,789040,this to be fair instead of a cutting
Zt4EjzoQ59M,789040,790800,board they were using like a desk like
Zt4EjzoQ59M,790800,792480,your school teacher had you'd be working
Zt4EjzoQ59M,792480,793760,and they'd be grading papers in the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,793760,795680,corner imagine instead of grading papers
Zt4EjzoQ59M,795680,797440,they're cutting up a whole goat that's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,797440,798959,what they're doing on that desk every
Zt4EjzoQ59M,798959,800410,day multiple times a day cheers
Zt4EjzoQ59M,800410,805519,[Music]
Zt4EjzoQ59M,805519,807360,your body
Zt4EjzoQ59M,807360,808800,all right what a relief i didn't know
Zt4EjzoQ59M,808800,810160,what to expect that might be super
Zt4EjzoQ59M,810160,812240,gaming i thought it could be a bit funky
Zt4EjzoQ59M,812240,814399,but i think that fire has cleansed this
Zt4EjzoQ59M,814399,816320,animal of any badness that might have
Zt4EjzoQ59M,816320,817200,been there it's got a little bit of
Zt4EjzoQ59M,817200,819120,goaty funk but overall it's good it's
Zt4EjzoQ59M,819120,821040,fatty it's juicy it's smoky from the
Zt4EjzoQ59M,821040,822800,charcoal i kind of like it i can see why
Zt4EjzoQ59M,822800,824079,you might want this you know it's a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,824079,825120,different kind of texture and a
Zt4EjzoQ59M,825120,826560,different experience than just eating
Zt4EjzoQ59M,826560,828320,the protein itself get some chapati

Zt4EjzoQ59M,841600,843519,country very safe very clean many many
Zt4EjzoQ59M,843519,846160,hills and a huge diversity in approaches
Zt4EjzoQ59M,846160,848160,to cooking street food not every culture
Zt4EjzoQ59M,848160,850079,not every country is a street food
Zt4EjzoQ59M,850079,851839,country i love street food but here you

Zt4EjzoQ59M,855519,857519,and find the street food type food when
Zt4EjzoQ59M,857519,859199,i came to rwanda maybe i knew what
Zt4EjzoQ59M,859199,860639,people had heard about rwanda in
Zt4EjzoQ59M,860639,862480,headlines or in the news but coming here
