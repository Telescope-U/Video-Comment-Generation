EhvArsT5rgM,3850,10108,This guy as a young man had a dream a dream to become a big movie star to come to a
EhvArsT5rgM,10389,15209,Hollywood and to become a great director and producer and a writer and all those kind of dreams
EhvArsT5rgM,15210,17340,He had of course everyone told him it can't be done
EhvArsT5rgM,17560,23189,"But, you know, he wouldn't take no for an answer and he moved across from New York to Los Angeles to Hollywood"
EhvArsT5rgM,23189,29849,And of course one day after struggling as we all do in the beginning to get into TV and in the movies
EhvArsT5rgM,30369,35639,He had this idea of writing a script and in longhand he wrote this script
EhvArsT5rgM,36190,38190,Which was Rocky?
EhvArsT5rgM,42500,46960,"It's all about dreams, you know, and by the way dreams cost nothing they're free"
EhvArsT5rgM,47450,51700,the hard part is just keeping them going and please keep them going because
EhvArsT5rgM,52010,55660,We're here for one simple reason he believed in the dream
EhvArsT5rgM,55660,61689,I believed in the dream and our dreams come true and there's no reason every one of yours. Can't either I
EhvArsT5rgM,68450,72820,Used to sit in this little apartment in that I was a room with my factory was so small
EhvArsT5rgM,72820,77350,Remember I was able to open up the window and close the door while sitting on the bed at the same time
EhvArsT5rgM,77350,82029,it was like eight feet by eight feet by nine feet and but
EhvArsT5rgM,82580,85869,The one thing about that room there was really very little distraction
EhvArsT5rgM,85869,90399,so I would sit there propped up in bed and I go out with my big pen and a
EhvArsT5rgM,90619,97689,legal pad and just start writing these these stories and and most of them were very very trivial but
EhvArsT5rgM,98060,100299,there was something about the process of
EhvArsT5rgM,101060,105610,Unrealized dreams. I was always brought back to this subject because I think it's one of the most
EhvArsT5rgM,106460,109389,enduring subjects and one of the most difficult
EhvArsT5rgM,110390,116979,Passages for people to accept that they never were realized in their own lifetime that they just didn't get that shot
EhvArsT5rgM,120850,123548,I decided it was a time to come to California
EhvArsT5rgM,123549,124939,"so to, California"
EhvArsT5rgM,124939,130599,and I moved in the valley and things weren't going very well there as a matter of fact I had to confront and
EhvArsT5rgM,130970,133149,Try to sell my dog because he was either
EhvArsT5rgM,133940,135680,do that or
EhvArsT5rgM,135680,140590,He just was not gonna be very well fed and then one night I went to see
EhvArsT5rgM,141739,143739,Muhammad Ali a fight for one brief moment
EhvArsT5rgM,144590,146090,this
EhvArsT5rgM,146090,148090,supposed
EhvArsT5rgM,148459,150459,Stumblebum turned out to be
EhvArsT5rgM,151010,156250,Magnificent in the fact that he lasted and knocked the champion down I said boy
EhvArsT5rgM,156250,161559,This isn't a metaphor for life his entire life crystallized at that moment. He will be remembered
EhvArsT5rgM,162080,167649,"For all eternity, at least it was among the fight fans. He did something extraordinary none of that"
EhvArsT5rgM,168590,174429,That is probably what I need as a catalyst for an idea the man who's going to stand up to life
EhvArsT5rgM,174799,177549,And take one shot and maybe go the distance
EhvArsT5rgM,177620,182679,So I started to write and it was one of those writing frenzies and three days later
EhvArsT5rgM,182840,185709,I came up with the script of Rocky
EhvArsT5rgM,186410,189729,Now the script by no means was a finished piece of material
EhvArsT5rgM,189799,196358,"It was probably about 90 pages and maybe 10% of it remained in the final script, but it was done"
EhvArsT5rgM,198090,199989,I
EhvArsT5rgM,199989,205079,First met Bob shot off in Irwin Winkler and I believe I was there on on a
EhvArsT5rgM,206410,207790,casting call
EhvArsT5rgM,207790,213120,So we're talking a little bit and I guess I really wasn't right for the acting partner on the way out
EhvArsT5rgM,213120,219090,"I said, um, I don't know if it matters but I do a little bit of writing because really he says he's yeah"
EhvArsT5rgM,219090,220680,I'm writing this story
EhvArsT5rgM,220680,226049,So I have this thing about wrestlers and I might do some of the boxing while you as well
EhvArsT5rgM,226510,230610,Bringing around and I thought if I hadn't stopped on the way out
EhvArsT5rgM,231010,237599,That's why I tell all actors hover haters don't give up keep talking eventually. You might hit a nerve somewhere. They go
EhvArsT5rgM,237849,239849,come on back and
EhvArsT5rgM,240430,246689,If they didn't say come on back or bring it later and let's see what you've developed. I wouldn't be sitting here
EhvArsT5rgM,246879,254278,so I have to give incredible credit to their to their insight and their patience and they're willing to take a chance which
EhvArsT5rgM,255880,258749,It doesn't exist much anymore unfortunately
EhvArsT5rgM,267720,272630,Originally when I brought the script to them they were and fairly enthusiastic about it
EhvArsT5rgM,272630,278179,The one thing they were not enthusiastic about was me playing the pardon and I really can't blame them at the time
EhvArsT5rgM,278180,281360,But there was something inside of me that that you know
EhvArsT5rgM,281360,281729,this
EhvArsT5rgM,281730,288319,opportunity is never gonna come around and I really wasn't used to money and I had no idea of what I would be missing but
EhvArsT5rgM,288870,292010,the temptation started to come forward first it was
EhvArsT5rgM,293250,295250,25 grains and
EhvArsT5rgM,295350,300379,"$100,000 zero, I never heard of 100 selling because I had had like a hundred six dollars the banking"
EhvArsT5rgM,300380,304130,"Like I said, I had to sell my dog and things were not looking very very good"
EhvArsT5rgM,304500,308029,My $40 car had just blown up. So I was taking a bus to work
EhvArsT5rgM,308730,312920,And was still it didn't matter. I wanted to stick with it. Then I went up to 150
EhvArsT5rgM,313560,315560,775 south and went up to
EhvArsT5rgM,315750,322130,"250,000 now my head was starting to spin and it went up to three hundred and thirty thousand and"
EhvArsT5rgM,322950,327770,"Probably I heard it was three hundred sixty thousand and I thought all right, you know"
EhvArsT5rgM,328560,332179,You've really managed poverty very well. You've got this down to a science
EhvArsT5rgM,332280,337519,You really don't need much to live on I had like sort of figured it out. So I was not
EhvArsT5rgM,338130,341029,in in any way I
EhvArsT5rgM,342389,345258,"Used to to the good life, so I thought you know what?"
EhvArsT5rgM,346020,352789,If I know in the back of my mind if I sell the script and it does very very well
EhvArsT5rgM,353370,356000,I'm gonna jump off the pole and if I'm not it
EhvArsT5rgM,356000,359000,so this is one of those things where you just roll the dice and you
EhvArsT5rgM,359550,364578,Fly by the proverbial seat of your pants a guy got frightened. I gotta just do it
EhvArsT5rgM,364580,370430,"I may be totally wrong and I'm gonna be taking a lot of people down with me, but I just believe in it"
EhvArsT5rgM,370770,375048,we were working with the handheld camera at the time was was Garrett Brown and it was
EhvArsT5rgM,375599,382579,Somewhat experimental and he'd film me running through shopping balls and up down and steps and flights. I mean
EhvArsT5rgM,383400,389929,curved corridors along the river until finally my legs basically gave out and I'm like writhing on the ground and I want to
EhvArsT5rgM,390479,398359,Rise up as hey John. I'm dying here and he goes no no use it used to pain. I said for what I mean
EhvArsT5rgM,398360,401840,"I'm in misery because well no, no, you know, it's giving your character"
EhvArsT5rgM,402090,407599,It's giving him some depth I said is giving me bruises is giving me like agony
EhvArsT5rgM,407599,412819,I can't sleep at night like the scene where we just jumped down and saw this ship along the dock this
EhvArsT5rgM,414000,416959,Doctor long appearance it just jump out run as faster
EhvArsT5rgM,416960,422210,"You can launch this ship and and and I'm running and running I said, you know what my legs are buckling"
EhvArsT5rgM,422340,427759,I'm literally gonna crash down here. Teeth are gonna go jaw face
EhvArsT5rgM,427759,431569,"I'm just gonna be ground down to this flat faced image, please"
EhvArsT5rgM,432680,434680,Just barely made it
EhvArsT5rgM,447999,454469,The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows it's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are
EhvArsT5rgM,454469,458729,It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you
EhvArsT5rgM,462039,465088,Me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life
EhvArsT5rgM,465789,472588,But it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take
EhvArsT5rgM,472659,474659,And keep moving forward
EhvArsT5rgM,475119,477119,That's how weird it is done
EhvArsT5rgM,484209,487078,Now if you know what you're worth that go out and get what you're worth
EhvArsT5rgM,487079,492929,but you got to be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or
EhvArsT5rgM,493029,495029,Her or anybody?
EhvArsT5rgM,495129,498268,Cowards do that and that ain't you you're better than that
EhvArsT5rgM,505120,507120,You can't be alone
EhvArsT5rgM,507879,509039,To really succeed
EhvArsT5rgM,509039,509669,"No, man"
EhvArsT5rgM,509669,511669,Really is an island when you find the right
EhvArsT5rgM,511870,516599,components in your life the right people that gel with you then you feel as though you
EhvArsT5rgM,517719,520349,You're invincible. It may be a fallacy
EhvArsT5rgM,520349,524429,But you at least feel as though you can you can take all that life has to dish out
EhvArsT5rgM,529340,534129,"At the very end of our lives if we can still say, you know, and we were never humbled"
EhvArsT5rgM,534130,537309,we were knocked down but we got up and I can say I
EhvArsT5rgM,537770,545230,Lived life with integrity and I took all the blows as the song says and I still prevailed I think that's it. That's a
EhvArsT5rgM,545870,547870,Good epitaph for anyone
EhvArsT5rgM,558670,563099,"It's all about dreams, you know, and by the way dreams cost nothing they're free"
EhvArsT5rgM,563620,569849,The hard part is just keeping them going and please keep them growing because we're here for one simple reason
EhvArsT5rgM,570100,577440,He believed in the dream. I believed in the dream when our dreams come true and there's no reason every one of yours. Can't either
EhvArsT5rgM,603649,605649,You
