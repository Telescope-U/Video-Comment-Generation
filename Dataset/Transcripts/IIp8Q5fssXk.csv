IIp8Q5fssXk,1040,7200,i mean it could be that we're just  missing that man we'll have to we'll  have to see but i think the the jackson  camille are thinking of smart bands away
IIp8Q5fssXk,7200,13759,from the gwen it's got to say hey look  we're going to set up zika perfectly in  the sideline to make sure that he's  going to have no real issues and already
IIp8Q5fssXk,13759,19359,you're getting like the gangplank gwen  camille like there's a lot that's  already bad air yeah there's got to be
IIp8Q5fssXk,19359,26320,the remake put i think you're going to  see a huge amount oh okay actually just  a reset we get the nautilus band but um
IIp8Q5fssXk,26320,31679,yeah i think there's a huge amount of  pressure now on to bin as to what  exactly wants to go for because you  don't really want to go towards like a
IIp8Q5fssXk,31679,36800,big tank in the top side because you do  really poorly against the gwen but i  feel like with the composition blg have
IIp8Q5fssXk,36800,42640,something like a cyan or noren would  work really well  yep certainly could certainly could i
IIp8Q5fssXk,42640,48239,i'm i like the lycentra band as well  towards you akai while yukai hasn't  actually played lasandra he has played a
IIp8Q5fssXk,48239,55520,lot of the swain  a lot of the galio a move let's go  so this is a movie
IIp8Q5fssXk,55520,60879,yeah we haven't seen a moomoo support in  of the longest time so um started to  come back into the meta when he
IIp8Q5fssXk,60879,66479,initially got changed and because he had  the double bandage toss and was super  aggressive in lane it could set up a ton
IIp8Q5fssXk,66479,72000,of plays and i think this is sick  because it means that ana's actually uh  who's playing instead of jin liu will
IIp8Q5fssXk,72000,78320,have a ton of run potential here and can  actually set up some really big plays  and can provide that engage to us so it
IIp8Q5fssXk,78320,84479,becomes very difficult for blg to  actually play out these fights with that  massive immune and how short-range blg
IIp8Q5fssXk,84479,91040,are  yeah i'm excited for this one it's gonna  be uh  certainly an interesting bottom line
IIp8Q5fssXk,91040,97520,callista amumu and hey the callisto  looks fantastic right having that extra  gap close you just throw him in and then
IIp8Q5fssXk,97520,103280,he goes kiss the sad mummy the bandage  toss can be a follow-up um  we'll have to see we'll have to see how
IIp8Q5fssXk,103280,108960,that one's gonna work out silas comes  out for icon that'll be his second time  playing this champion now we just need
IIp8Q5fssXk,108960,116320,uh a lock-in for that mid lane oh i'm so  excited doctor i can't wait to see this  one i love how icard was like wait
IIp8Q5fssXk,116320,121759,yeah a mummy want is sick i'm i'm going  to get a bit of that i want a bit of  this in my fault because he's just like
IIp8Q5fssXk,121759,126880,hey look just provide a little bit more  engage to have the counter punch  whenever a movement goes in and you can
IIp8Q5fssXk,126880,132480,just get better ap scaling here for the  the silence so this is honestly going to  be a really really sick game and with
IIp8Q5fssXk,132480,138720,you akai even matching now with the rise  here to try and push inside us look for  the roams you've got a really strong 2v2
IIp8Q5fssXk,138720,145200,for ig with shouldn't you akai so i  expect them to try and play through this  mid jungle and then lean into side lanes
IIp8Q5fssXk,145200,150640,but uh i mean this is gonna be super  cool to see how uh how both sides end up
IIp8Q5fssXk,150640,156239,using these big ultimates that are  available  yeah we'll have to see i i'm really
IIp8Q5fssXk,156239,162080,excited though this is going to be such  an aggressive game i feel like in that  bottom side like you have to play around
IIp8Q5fssXk,162080,168480,with your movie right he's got so much  setup and you've already got a callista  as well like  if ig aren't playing around this bottom
IIp8Q5fssXk,168480,174800,side i don't know what they're doing  with this draft like this that's the way  they've got to play  yeah especially because the the thing is
IIp8Q5fssXk,174800,180959,when you end up leaving the kalista and  the felios alone fenus can actually do a  lot of damage in the early stages and
IIp8Q5fssXk,180959,187519,especially if he has things like the  gravitum and firm combo like we've seen  him just one shot kalista's because  kalista takes time to ramp up and it's
IIp8Q5fssXk,187519,193680,very good at these short burst trades um  or when she's able to properly stack up  damage but affiliates has a ton of
IIp8Q5fssXk,193680,198800,bursts in his kit which makes a little  bit tough so if you end up having the  umu leave the bot lane you're then
IIp8Q5fssXk,198800,205840,opting into that as as the kalista which  can be a little bit scary so i feel like  we're gonna have a ton of pressure down  towards the spot side especially with a
IIp8Q5fssXk,205840,211200,rise there as well it feels like a  no-brainer to look for these dives with  the umumu pull them back out with the
IIp8Q5fssXk,211200,217519,calista and i will say though  i want to i want to just quickly clarify
IIp8Q5fssXk,217519,224159,here for anyone that doesn't know ann is  an ad carry um i don't know what has  happened i don't know why ig is not
IIp8Q5fssXk,224159,230239,running uh their main roster here  i'm literally scrolling through their  twitter as we speak to to try and find
IIp8Q5fssXk,230239,237680,out information i i've not been told  anything but double lady carry the  bottom line it's gonna be wink playing  support on the samumu and already
IIp8Q5fssXk,237680,245599,started off strong on gonna be  staggering  oh my god they're gonna kill doggo they  want more auto i'll get smashed blood
IIp8Q5fssXk,245599,252000,and this is why the amumu's so strong  the fact that you get this double  bandage toss means you can provide so
IIp8Q5fssXk,252000,258239,much cc in the early stages of doggo he  doesn't respect it the cleanse just kind  of comes out for nothing because the
IIp8Q5fssXk,258239,263840,bandage toss had already done his due  diligence which means the second wood  lands and there you go the double ad
IIp8Q5fssXk,263840,270880,carries clearly better than having a  support lay late and i like it if you're  gonna have like no support player i
IIp8Q5fssXk,270880,276720,assume somebody's ill or something like  that right yeah um but if you're gonna  have 280 carriers in that bottom lane
IIp8Q5fssXk,276720,282320,why not run a kill lane why not run  something that's super aggressive it's  not like amumu's the most mechanically
IIp8Q5fssXk,282320,288240,intensive champion in the game you know  so  for me i love it i i like the way that  they're approaching this
IIp8Q5fssXk,288240,294479,i agree i think this is super smart you  can see here doggo completely caught out  so they wrap around behind the vision he
IIp8Q5fssXk,294479,299840,takes one step out of the bush and there  you can see with the glacial augment  that's the slow but i mean doggo
IIp8Q5fssXk,299840,305600,literally cleanses nothing just pure  panic like cleanses uh tries to cleanse  the slow from the glacial augment but
IIp8Q5fssXk,305600,311360,it's still on the glacial occult path so  it does nothing and wink had a second  follow-up on the bandage task so doggo
IIp8Q5fssXk,311360,317680,just panicking completely on that plate  interestingly and still has his black  spirit oh my god still in the bottom
IIp8Q5fssXk,317680,324320,side i don't think it'll be too much on  this one just trying to force the level  two here so we've actually taken a lot  of damage for his trouble uh this is the
IIp8Q5fssXk,324320,330240,first time that we're seeing  uh the amumu in a little while as doko  getting more spears upon him i'm gonna
IIp8Q5fssXk,330240,336840,rend one more walter would have done the  trick oh my days  seven hp on the ofelio
IIp8Q5fssXk,336840,343440,seven and now he's gonna reset he's  gonna miss this massive wave and  especially in the early stages these
IIp8Q5fssXk,343440,349120,early levels matter so much and the fact  that doggo now still level one means  that wayway wants to make a play
IIp8Q5fssXk,349120,354479,you akai in trouble here icon the one  set it up way way moving in your guy  knows that he's doomed on this one but
IIp8Q5fssXk,354479,362000,maybe he could turn it around and go one  for one oh he flashes out but he's  followed by wayward now shunning the 2v1  can he find the w on to icon i don't
IIp8Q5fssXk,362000,368000,think so the ruined prison will keep him  at bay  yeah just barely i can't able to set up
IIp8Q5fssXk,368000,375440,that play but nice job we talked about  how oh boom here but how the 2v2 was  going to mean so much for this uh this
IIp8Q5fssXk,375440,381440,game an icon coming out on top in that  initial trade yeah definitely oh this is
IIp8Q5fssXk,381440,386960,already a bag of dagger what games  right here is moving forward they want
IIp8Q5fssXk,386960,393120,an invade now wink is not stopping he's  like look if i'm not playing ad carry  i'm a roaming support i have played
IIp8Q5fssXk,393120,398319,enough games for my support abandoned me  and you're on your own mate  and this is what it looks like when the
IIp8Q5fssXk,398319,403440,lady carries free from the burdening of  students when he is free to roam the map
IIp8Q5fssXk,403440,409759,that is he once they dreamed up but  honestly that's working out great i mean  you've got a 10cs lead in the bot side
IIp8Q5fssXk,409759,416240,doggo is down  a lit level as well  this the calista's already picked up the  coal for herself she's well on her way
IIp8Q5fssXk,416240,421520,towards her boots like ig's bot lane is  absolutely dominating to the 2v2 you do
IIp8Q5fssXk,421520,427120,still have to be careful though of  making sure that you have to keep  control of this mid lane though because  if icon is able to steal things like the
IIp8Q5fssXk,427120,432560,realm warp then start to move down  towards this bottom side the lg can  start to kind of right the ship here on
IIp8Q5fssXk,432560,438800,the bot lane  yeah that would be the question i mean  we said right at the start it's a lot  going to be about getting an early lead
IIp8Q5fssXk,438800,445680,well certainly if i can can just  snowball like crazy that will certainly  work but way way with that first kill
IIp8Q5fssXk,445680,451199,maybe he can be the advantage for blg  zika moving in and we talked about this  top lane we said this is gonna be the
IIp8Q5fssXk,451199,457360,matchup to watch right we were  highlighting this one v1 between zika  and bin not even looked up here just yet
IIp8Q5fssXk,457360,462400,because there's been so much action on  the bottom side but as i say that zika  going aggressive but bin's about to turn
IIp8Q5fssXk,462400,469360,mega i don't think that's a fight zika  once right now  then again i've been wrong before doctor  he's going aggressive they are sparring
IIp8Q5fssXk,469360,475199,heavily  i will say nice i stepped from zika to  dodge bins uh w there so it doesn't
IIp8Q5fssXk,475199,481039,actually get the full damage wink  yeah you've got to be so careful as a
IIp8Q5fssXk,481039,487280,moomoo because uh this is the thing  amumu isn't actually that tanky and  especially if you're able to get the uh
IIp8Q5fssXk,487280,492560,the trades back so wink does have to be  very careful that he's finding the right  moments to engage here because poke from
IIp8Q5fssXk,492560,499199,chris polk from doggo even if you end up  with the uh the handshake as well to  dissuade you you can put yourself in a
IIp8Q5fssXk,499199,505440,lot into a really bad position trying to  get some of these bandage tosses off and  it can really come back to hurt you
IIp8Q5fssXk,505440,511520,yeah one thing i'm a little curious  about i don't know how the interaction  works so you know how  amumu when he's against zeri takes
IIp8Q5fssXk,511520,517440,basically no damage from the hues  because it all counts as auto attacks  and his tantrum reduces that damage
IIp8Q5fssXk,517440,523518,uh zika or all inning in the top side  here bin flashes away from the snip snip  now wink in the bottom side as well
IIp8Q5fssXk,523518,529200,chris in trouble flashes keeps himself  safe wink goes forward again but ig's  health bars are getting kind of low they
IIp8Q5fssXk,529200,534640,have to flash his status your kai moves  in just gets rooted up doggo still just  going ham on everyone
IIp8Q5fssXk,534640,540800,yeah i mean nice job from doggo there  and also chris chris obviously flashes  away but juggle getting some nice return
IIp8Q5fssXk,540800,546800,fire that's kind of the problem that  you're seeing if you don't 100  get this engage off you'll take so much
IIp8Q5fssXk,546800,552399,damage but the fact now you've burnt the  summer spells on crisp means he's now  way more vulnerable and i do expect to
IIp8Q5fssXk,552399,558240,see a lot more damage down towards this  bot side especially with the way shun's  probably got a path here and he's gonna
IIp8Q5fssXk,558240,563920,be passing back down towards his bot  side can look towards the play on the  bot end of the map plus also maybe
IIp8Q5fssXk,563920,570560,towards the dragon and just before that  rip turn spawns in two minutes time  oh big damage in that replay that was
IIp8Q5fssXk,570560,577120,very nicely played by christian dogger  actually to get damage down onto han  before this play but they did kind of
IIp8Q5fssXk,577120,584480,underestimate what the umu could do in  return is blg grouping up on the top  side here clearing vision icon away way
IIp8Q5fssXk,584480,590480,potential to roam up towards that top  side but shun and winker already here  wink is on the top side of the map right
IIp8Q5fssXk,590480,596880,now he has given up on bottom lane  entirely he is not a support he is a  second jungler hey i mean look we've had
IIp8Q5fssXk,596880,602720,some great ad carries move into the  support role and take over for jj being  one maybe we need to add wink
IIp8Q5fssXk,602720,609680,bin's gone for it in the top side at the  worst possible moment wink is here to  jump over the wall down goes bin and ig
IIp8Q5fssXk,609680,616240,making it work without a support  i mean  you know what they say it was you quoted
IIp8Q5fssXk,616240,621920,this to me before whereas like you know  what ringo isn't even the best drummer  on the beatles maybe shin lou isn't even
IIp8Q5fssXk,621920,627600,the best supporter  because honestly wings kind of cracked  he's been all over the map he's fighting
IIp8Q5fssXk,627600,633760,good engages he's been setting up pretty  well on this bot side and like being in  the right place to answer maybe this is
IIp8Q5fssXk,633760,639839,the combo maybe this is this is more of  a for life thing you know  look all i'm saying is the best supports
IIp8Q5fssXk,639839,646560,always use the 80 carries because 80 you  know what your 80 carry wants and you  know how to uh completely abandon your
IIp8Q5fssXk,646560,652480,ad carry as well because you could  finally leave that bottom lane i mean my  favorite example is
IIp8Q5fssXk,652480,659440,back in the day if you remember he  swapped over to sport back in like i  don't know it was like season two or  three or something but um i remember in
IIp8Q5fssXk,659440,666320,the in the short term he was an amazing  support within the lcs um exciting times  back then there's a way we'll find that
IIp8Q5fssXk,666320,672399,ward but does mean igf full information  i feel like drake has to be done soon
IIp8Q5fssXk,672399,678560,right herald coming up as well the fact  that no neutrals have been done just yet  it's making me anxious
IIp8Q5fssXk,678560,683680,yeah i mean i feel like the reptile is  gonna be the big one so on and wink here  should have decent push on towards the
IIp8Q5fssXk,683680,688880,bot side like they can actually set this  up as a uh a slow push in towards the  opposition although douglas just easily
IIp8Q5fssXk,688880,693920,cleared the way but uh  you've got to see if we shouldn't can  get down here to try and help out on
IIp8Q5fssXk,693920,700560,that because you can see wayway is  already in position to try and help out  in this push and now he's kind of  holding the hand of darko and crisp as
IIp8Q5fssXk,700560,706240,they move up through river to look  towards this river  yeah moving up towards that top side
IIp8Q5fssXk,706240,712480,here you see wink and are now moving as  well actually they're just  going for the grump we're going for a  reset i don't think there's going to be
IIp8Q5fssXk,712480,717519,a full contest you okay not getting the  memo on this one getting caught out  forced to flash and chased over the wall
IIp8Q5fssXk,717519,723279,by wayway shun is here though wayward  might have gone a bit too deep  ignite is actually burnt there it's
IIp8Q5fssXk,723279,729760,yukai spellbook ignite but blg should  have been able to buy themselves enough  space now just brute force this herald
IIp8Q5fssXk,729760,735120,well yukai does have his tp back up so  should be able to get there so you still  have to be careful here as blg i think
IIp8Q5fssXk,735120,740959,you got to look for the fight and once  ig start to come through  i don't know if i are going to get here
IIp8Q5fssXk,740959,748000,in time though the herald's already down  to 3k maybe they just go for a fight  anyway  sans harold blg have got that one icon
IIp8Q5fssXk,748000,753760,trying to find the gap close but shun  dodges it that curse the sad mummy would  have been the first of the game i could
IIp8Q5fssXk,753760,759200,get it before wink even has access  yeah it could have been very scary and
IIp8Q5fssXk,759200,765760,when you've got such a big ultimate and  also just the ap scaling gonna do a ton  of work although icon doesn't have a  huge amount of ap in his kit at the
IIp8Q5fssXk,765760,771279,moment but uh yeah unfortunately ig they  rotate everyone up not able to get into  a position to actually fight it that
IIp8Q5fssXk,771279,776959,means that you don't get to trade  anything there like on isn't able to get  on towards the bot side to actually get  some terror damage and you're not
IIp8Q5fssXk,776959,782639,actually getting the wave fully pushed  in mid either because yukai really just  caught the wave so overall just blg
IIp8Q5fssXk,782639,787760,coming out tops in that  look at icon on the map we've got shun
IIp8Q5fssXk,787760,793600,in the brush currently icon really wants  to use this cursor the sad mummy zucker  suddenly in trouble shun's still here
IIp8Q5fssXk,793600,800480,but i don't know if they win this one  because here comes wayweight as well  because the sad mummy about to come out  any second here gets both targets in
IIp8Q5fssXk,800480,806000,comes way way and down falls shun great  play from blg
IIp8Q5fssXk,806000,813440,they were hoping that they'd have yukai  be able to roam up in time to that top  side you can see moving on the mini map  but unfortunately blg check the bush
IIp8Q5fssXk,813440,819199,right as uh yuakai ends up starting to  move up and it means that they're  completely caught out i also think a bit
IIp8Q5fssXk,819199,826000,of a mistake from shun there  i think using the e to try and start off  that play i think he could have waited  for the hop from bin to try and follow
IIp8Q5fssXk,826000,834320,but either way now it's blg starting to  answer back and getting some of this  gold deficit back in their favor
IIp8Q5fssXk,834320,841279,yeah we're just about even on gold it's  only a forage gold leading paper fly  chief for the time being is it we'll  just be winking on trying to force a bit
IIp8Q5fssXk,841279,847519,of priority on the bottom side pings on  towards the drake but look at icon once  again i'm loving watching icon on blg
IIp8Q5fssXk,847519,853920,he's just has no interest in the mid  lane he's getting anywhere else he can  on the map doggo's here chris trying to
IIp8Q5fssXk,853920,859600,get the slow onto wink to start this one  off the handshake there's a face chord  to keep wink safe wink is still level
IIp8Q5fssXk,859600,864720,five they don't have to curse the sad  mummy ig can't fight this and this is
IIp8Q5fssXk,864720,869920,what we've been talking about with icon  as he said like him roaming around he  will get the wave made foot again he's
IIp8Q5fssXk,869920,875360,missing just that little bit of cs to  try and make these plays happen and  although he'd get the playing top
IIp8Q5fssXk,875360,880639,couldn't make it succeed in bop but you  akai hasn't really been able to punish  him yukai hasn't been pushing the waves
IIp8Q5fssXk,880639,886800,as quickly hasn't really got the damage  on the turret has got one playful icon  here  i might have to just use that
IIp8Q5fssXk,886800,892639,immediately there just keep himself safe  as the whole of ig jumping in wing  catcher got six oh flashes before they
IIp8Q5fssXk,892639,897760,all after the renata are up there wink  goes down though there's icon just  tanking for his whole team finally falls
IIp8Q5fssXk,897760,904000,himself but that's a mid laner for his  support blg need to make more happen  there's one for chris but shun and on
IIp8Q5fssXk,904000,910880,jumping onto doggo the rent is there can  they get one last q chris blocks it as  on can't chase for any more but even
IIp8Q5fssXk,910880,916560,still it's an even trade  but it does mean ig can get onto the  drake yeah great job for wing to get
IIp8Q5fssXk,916560,922560,that engage and as you say you know even  on the trade with the kills but the  dragon going in favor of ig is gonna be
IIp8Q5fssXk,922560,928399,super good for them especially now that  you get to see on pushing in those bot  side you'll actually get to crash this
IIp8Q5fssXk,928399,934959,wave so you end up losing a little bit  of cs in that bot lane as well for the  felios but icon i think here just a
IIp8Q5fssXk,934959,940160,little bit of mistake going a bit too  deep chris nerdy gets this great  ultimate off but not quite enough to get
IIp8Q5fssXk,940160,946320,on to some of the key members cleanse  from on as well instantly and then wink  with this flash in you just have ig with
IIp8Q5fssXk,946320,951360,the earlier scaling composition they  have so much more damage here from on
IIp8Q5fssXk,951360,956480,and from the uh zinzo as well and over  back into his fight instantly but
IIp8Q5fssXk,956480,963279,there is no reprieve  i'm fine with that i am totally okay  with that i'm i'm like i'm along for the
IIp8Q5fssXk,963279,970000,ride of whatever this game is right now  i know especially in a blg game you're  getting your blg game are you like you
IIp8Q5fssXk,970000,975199,know what this is gonna be slow it's  gonna be boring either herald no they  can't quite get it in time ig can't
IIp8Q5fssXk,975199,980320,destroy the herald there's a blg now one  thing to quickly mention ig did get the
IIp8Q5fssXk,980320,988720,drake during that replay so it is one  drake for ig now gold slightly ahead oh  my god it's in trouble here comes the
IIp8Q5fssXk,988720,995600,goon squad icon has transformed this  team  yes someone needs to record scratch that
IIp8Q5fssXk,995600,1001440,moment where it's like i guess you would  have like got here honestly  and it's just like i'm underneath terror
IIp8Q5fssXk,1001440,1008240,this is totally fine and next thing you  know there's just three members show  i mean blg they were killing him no
IIp8Q5fssXk,1008240,1013839,matter what it took yeah they they  wanted to make a play an icon 100 kill
IIp8Q5fssXk,1013839,1021360,participation on this silence i am  loving what i'm seeing and i have let's  be honest historically not a big fan of
IIp8Q5fssXk,1021360,1026640,my god i've i've said my share of uh  criticisms towards icon over the years
IIp8Q5fssXk,1026640,1032880,of lpl but today on plg i'm loving what  i'm seeing  and i have to say it is still slightly
IIp8Q5fssXk,1032880,1039839,hilarious to me that like blg on these  plays from icon absolutely spectacular  when it's them going towards a lane like
IIp8Q5fssXk,1039839,1045438,canking an opponent the second we get  into team fights blg lose the fight so  we're still seeing everything that it's
IIp8Q5fssXk,1045438,1050880,consistent with oh my god ahn just  doesn't get to play they do the round
IIp8Q5fssXk,1050880,1056720,warp goon squad and then immediately  after everyone just hides the bot like  brush and odd gets wrecked again two
IIp8Q5fssXk,1056720,1062720,back to back death there for the ig bot  laner the weird thing is  they're not even there's no drake or
IIp8Q5fssXk,1062720,1068880,anything the goal was literally just to  buy doggo space to get on this tower  yeah and i mean you'd be very close to
IIp8Q5fssXk,1068880,1075440,taking it down as well and the fact  you're saying this kalista behind me is  that she basically just is gonna be  useless and she doesn't really get to do
IIp8Q5fssXk,1075440,1081360,particularly much for the rest of the  game and it's not as you say with no  objective on the map it's not like ig of  anything that they can actually turn
IIp8Q5fssXk,1081360,1087120,towards although they will try and look  for this play on the top side and see if  they can get uh play onto bin but yes
IIp8Q5fssXk,1087120,1094000,flash he's about to go megan there i  just don't really feel like there's a  play you can make up here are we on auto  director yeah if the camera's been like
IIp8Q5fssXk,1094000,1100480,following  characters very closely i guess uh  observer really needed a week yeah he
IIp8Q5fssXk,1100480,1107440,just needed to you know put the feet up  you know take it out stretch maybe have  to go  yeah he was like it's a blg game i could
IIp8Q5fssXk,1107440,1113440,just put my feet up he's realized this  is not i'm gonna have to concentrate for  this one get some coffee he's woken up
IIp8Q5fssXk,1113440,1121039,now harold on the board six to four on  the scoreboard here gold just about even  and everybody piling in been on his way
IIp8Q5fssXk,1121039,1126160,he's gonna be the last one to the play  but the lg enough presses to push ig off  for now
IIp8Q5fssXk,1126160,1132080,the thing is though bin will have to  stack up his  nara bar before he gets here as well so  it's a lot of time before bin's gonna be
IIp8Q5fssXk,1132080,1138160,a big factor and ig they're able to just  steal this one away before bog are  really in position so and we kind of get
IIp8Q5fssXk,1138160,1144320,the reverse side of this first rift  herald where it's now ig who were kind  of forcing blg to dance their drum at
IIp8Q5fssXk,1144320,1150640,the rooftop  i was i saw blg all grouped up in that  singular brush then and you're against
IIp8Q5fssXk,1150640,1157520,in a movie i could see disaster in their  future but everybody backs away in the  end herald as you say going to shun
IIp8Q5fssXk,1157520,1162799,a nice little pickup by ig  blg i'm not sure if indecisive or also
IIp8Q5fssXk,1162799,1169200,agreeing that amumu's not the champion  they want to fight right now  yeah i think at the moment the og just
IIp8Q5fssXk,1169200,1174720,want to wait to scale a little bit doggo  to get into a position where he's  comfortable you've got way way as well
IIp8Q5fssXk,1174720,1181600,he's going to have good late game  skating but as you say he's you still be  careful like zuka lake game is going to  be really uh good in these team fights
IIp8Q5fssXk,1181600,1186640,especially because you are playing  against relatively short range ad  carrying dunko like doggo has to step
IIp8Q5fssXk,1186640,1193120,into the hollowed missed dealer's damage  which can be very very tough for vlg's
IIp8Q5fssXk,1194440,1200559,foreign a bit of damage down onto the  blg jungler in the meantime been pushing  on the top side drake about sporting 25
IIp8Q5fssXk,1200559,1206960,seconds but bin does have tp he's  exhausted from megan currently though  not even stacking there we go finally
IIp8Q5fssXk,1206960,1213520,getting some rage stacks  on the board but he'll just get this  tower drake's still not even spawned  just yet he has tp he can keep this a
IIp8Q5fssXk,1213520,1220080,full day yeah i think he does i think he  tries to threaten the tier two i mean a  second dragon at this stage is totally
IIp8Q5fssXk,1220080,1226960,fine for blg to give up if they want to  because simply put like  you've got 10 minutes 15 minutes until
IIp8Q5fssXk,1226960,1232400,like you actually have to worry about  like a soul or anything like that so  i mean blg even going to get this one so
IIp8Q5fssXk,1232400,1237919,overall they're actually in a fine spot  but ig kind of saying well through that  we're just gonna run mid try and get
IIp8Q5fssXk,1237919,1245200,this play off of rift herald while you  put resources into the bottom side of  room  yeah ben actually ran mid as uh tpd mid
IIp8Q5fssXk,1245200,1251600,sorry turned megan are back away off  on the top side of the place so all  things considered it's a trade uh of a
IIp8Q5fssXk,1251600,1256640,mid tower there well actually no they  didn't quite finish the mid tower it was  close though there's a field you try and
IIp8Q5fssXk,1256640,1262400,answer that mid tower zika jumps on  forward using that miss been turning  minnie nah this is the opportunity for
IIp8Q5fssXk,1262400,1268880,ig if they can find the fight zika goes  forward there's one onto chris dargo  trying to finish it off but i'm jumping
IIp8Q5fssXk,1268880,1275280,winkston stuck off but he escapes  somehow finally taking down wink versus  another 80 carry but this time he's like
IIp8Q5fssXk,1275280,1280640,a mummy causes a bit despair but i can't  he's a little sad himself dinnered it
IIp8Q5fssXk,1280640,1285679,around but ig they've just got too many  players oh it looks so good i saw the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1285679,1290720,play i was like my god has got it the  flash he's gonna be able to do it but ig
IIp8Q5fssXk,1290720,1295760,just too far ahead in the fight and they  will get the kills they will get the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1295760,1302720,tower at ig have just about eat  themselves out of gold lead
IIp8Q5fssXk,1302720,1307919,they certainly have just about like you  say one thousand is their lead it was
IIp8Q5fssXk,1307919,1314240,blg oh sorry yeah it was blg that got  the drake in the end but  this was not really about the drake this
IIp8Q5fssXk,1314240,1320880,is blg extending for a tower yeah you  can see there ben didn't get the  the gnar off just as he turned mini was
IIp8Q5fssXk,1320880,1327280,hoping to kind of push shun out of the  equation but blg incredibly separated  here icon was on the bottom side of the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1327280,1334159,map so it wasn't actually here as blg  tried to over extend for the tower and  he does end up stealing away the amumu
IIp8Q5fssXk,1334159,1340720,but again like you've got way way you  got icon bin is trying to come back into  the equation but he can't really do  particularly much and without the resets
IIp8Q5fssXk,1340720,1347120,really there for weiwei he's not able to  carry this fight so just unfortunate  time and again from blg but what we are
IIp8Q5fssXk,1347120,1353440,bringing up right like even when blg get  these early leads their team fighting  still uncoordinated not having people in
IIp8Q5fssXk,1353440,1359200,the right places before they look for  engages or are just trying to overextend  on the map
IIp8Q5fssXk,1359200,1364320,yeah it feels like blg once again issues  with communication there right icon on  the bottom side of the map the rest of
IIp8Q5fssXk,1364320,1370320,the team over extending mid not  anticipating that ig could force that  fight and the thing is it wasn't even
IIp8Q5fssXk,1370320,1375520,wind right  i don't think they anticipate that zika  could just run at them and take a kill
IIp8Q5fssXk,1375520,1382320,that easily right they thought that they  were safe and they were sorely mistaken  so now gold lead as you said before a
IIp8Q5fssXk,1382320,1390240,thousand for ig baron onto the map in  five seconds time i don't think either  team really in a position to threaten
IIp8Q5fssXk,1390240,1396880,now i think they're just gonna chill out  for a little bit of time from ig's  perspective i actually think they're in  a relatively good spot here where they
IIp8Q5fssXk,1396880,1402720,can push mid and have wings start to  roam around potentially look for dives  underneath towers and as the curse was
IIp8Q5fssXk,1402720,1408960,said um i supposed to say chris has had  bullet time but it's just because this  is such an honest because christmas
IIp8Q5fssXk,1408960,1416799,um is there to play but i don't know if  i do want to do this  i was wrong  i was very wrong
IIp8Q5fssXk,1417840,1423279,decides against the hex flash at the end  5k on the back remember this is a  callista they can just combo for this
IIp8Q5fssXk,1423279,1428400,fight 2k into 50 50 and shun gets it in  the end now the fight ensuing ig in the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1428400,1433840,back of the pit they get one kill for  themselves wink sacrificed for the cause  can the rest of the team win moonlight
IIp8Q5fssXk,1433840,1439039,vigil goes wide shone in the back of the  pit zika over the wall i'm trying to 1v1  bin in the meantime though doggo is
IIp8Q5fssXk,1439039,1446559,going crazy shun's gonna go down but  managed to get a double before he does  keeps himself safe for a second ig they
IIp8Q5fssXk,1446559,1452159,get a baron it's a three for four  i have no idea if that was worth i mean
IIp8Q5fssXk,1452159,1458720,just from the goal that everyone gets at  ig it will be worth you can see there  like they still have a thousand gold  lead off the play from getting baron
IIp8Q5fssXk,1458720,1465120,even going down a kill but i mean  that could have gone so much worse i
IIp8Q5fssXk,1465120,1470400,actually got to give shadow to wink wink  is playing out of his mind in this game  like the fact he goes forward here and
IIp8Q5fssXk,1470400,1476400,gets on to crisp and doggo is the reason  that nobody's have to follow up on this  brilliant engage from chris like if you
IIp8Q5fssXk,1476400,1482400,actually have doggo in the mix in this  pit this is a very different story but  wink as he said sacrifice himself here
IIp8Q5fssXk,1482400,1488880,so then the rest of ig can actually  mount an offense shun as well realizing  hey look i need to go in here or again
IIp8Q5fssXk,1488880,1494559,my team are going to be stuck and  unfortunately wasn't able to hop over  the pit wall like the gwen was or it
IIp8Q5fssXk,1494559,1500080,could have been a better trade for them  but you still have the uh barrett on  zuka you can still put a good amount of
IIp8Q5fssXk,1500080,1505600,pressure on the sideline and i think  this is where we're going to start to  see zika take over a bit 4-0-2 on this
IIp8Q5fssXk,1505600,1511440,gwen two items now completed with the  masters too like zucker's in a great  spot
IIp8Q5fssXk,1511440,1516640,yep he certainly is four zero and two  we'll see what zika can do in this next
IIp8Q5fssXk,1516640,1522799,fight  15 seconds until that drake comes up  the division there for ig as they trying
IIp8Q5fssXk,1522799,1529279,to move forward they're trying to  contest icon taking a face call i didn't  see who he bound to early on but i would
IIp8Q5fssXk,1529279,1535600,assume it would be way way uh of all  people really shun takes a hit that's a  gravitum as well bit more damage down
IIp8Q5fssXk,1535600,1542960,onto the jungler we're just gonna fight  we're just gonna go in icons going into  the middle of everyone it's a big  hostile takeover but not big enough been
IIp8Q5fssXk,1542960,1548799,about to turn mega maybe get some stunts  but there's no follow-up from the team  in comes way away that's the follow-up
IIp8Q5fssXk,1548799,1554080,we were looking for he's turned into  gwen and it's a one-for-one  somehow blg might have turned that
IIp8Q5fssXk,1554080,1560799,around as a doggo looking for more oh  don't go so close his flash was a split
IIp8Q5fssXk,1560799,1567600,second on cooldown or he could have  finished that kill beautifully played  blg finding a bit of space
IIp8Q5fssXk,1567600,1572640,i mean they do get the kills but it was  very messy in that fight you're looking
IIp8Q5fssXk,1572640,1578480,at icon going in when doggo's not really  a position to follow up you've been  using the mega nar but again the rest of
IIp8Q5fssXk,1578480,1583919,blg are running for the hills this is a  bit of a miracle that this worked out  because watch where doggo is here right
IIp8Q5fssXk,1583919,1589200,like he's not able to follow up in this  at all he's got to wrap the hallway  around the wall his icon goes in so the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1589200,1595440,entire time that icon is golden you're  getting no damage actually coming out  from uh doggo he gets a couple of shots
IIp8Q5fssXk,1595440,1601039,off the back and even here bin going in  aggressive while doggo is walking away  crisp has already used the shirellis
IIp8Q5fssXk,1601039,1606400,reverie to back out as well and suddenly  everyone from blg is going in this is  the miscommunication that we were
IIp8Q5fssXk,1606400,1612480,talking about and honestly like  they're kind of lucky that this fight  went as well as it did
IIp8Q5fssXk,1612480,1619840,yeah sean is extremely lucky  if i just survived that one at the end  of it like and i agree that like clearly
IIp8Q5fssXk,1619840,1627200,blg are separated i'm starting to get to  the point that where i'm not sure if  this is like a communication issue or  like a fundamental difference between
IIp8Q5fssXk,1627200,1633360,the blg players on how you should be  playing league of legends right because  i feel like it's been too consistent to
IIp8Q5fssXk,1633360,1640320,just be that they're not talking to each  other i feel like that's something that  you can very easily fix  yeah i mean look we did see the uh
IIp8Q5fssXk,1640320,1645360,documentary with breathe on the team  where he was getting very frustrated at  the communication issues that are on the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1645360,1650960,team where people are just screaming and  not listening to each other so it could  easily be a communication or honestly as
IIp8Q5fssXk,1650960,1657360,you can see there like a difference in  how far you want to push the game how  heavily you want to go forward so it
IIp8Q5fssXk,1657360,1663200,could be either of those things and but  it's not quite working for blg either  way although to say that it's been
IIp8Q5fssXk,1663200,1669279,getting a nice trade but i want to see  if they can add that consistency in like  it feels like you've got the star power
IIp8Q5fssXk,1669279,1674399,here and make it work oh yeah and  honestly in this game it may not even  matter i think the scaling from wayway
IIp8Q5fssXk,1674399,1681039,and doggo may just starting to become  too much for ig to handle  i will say dagda like look if they
IIp8Q5fssXk,1681039,1686320,if they have issues on uh whether or not  they're going in i think bin will  certainly solve those issues and it
IIp8Q5fssXk,1686320,1692799,seems like icon will too right these  guys wanna go with bim is historically  known for just wanting to go in whereas
IIp8Q5fssXk,1692799,1698320,icon i wouldn't say that's the case  necessarily as a reputation for this  player but based on what we're seeing
IIp8Q5fssXk,1698320,1704480,today it feels like this guy wants to be  proactive so it might be an issue that  doggo and crisp need to start being a
IIp8Q5fssXk,1704480,1709679,bit more aggressive themselves as well  is there way way backing away just  staying slightly out of vision will
IIp8Q5fssXk,1709679,1715520,finally be spotted no drake on the map  right now just fostering for a flight  anyway and you know what that's the kind
IIp8Q5fssXk,1715520,1720960,of league of legends i love  yeah i think it's about trying to set up  vision control here for ig where they
IIp8Q5fssXk,1720960,1726720,can actually push mid lean into the  jungle here as you can see and now get  to slowly but surely creep their vision
IIp8Q5fssXk,1726720,1732320,forward because they want to get bot  terror they want to be able to keep  control over um how much of the map blg
IIp8Q5fssXk,1732320,1739760,have access to but that requires them to  actually be able to potentially find in  this bot side to get that control thing
IIp8Q5fssXk,1739760,1745679,looks like zika will be able to finish  this tower off in the end so they do  find that bot tower that they were  looking for
IIp8Q5fssXk,1745679,1751840,and so far so good and i have to say  that i just want to return to what we  were saying i'm impressed by ig display
IIp8Q5fssXk,1751840,1757679,i feel like they're developing an  identity for themselves i feel like a  lot of these players if all of these
IIp8Q5fssXk,1757679,1764080,players didn't really have a big  reputation before they joined ig they  are starting to build those reputations
IIp8Q5fssXk,1764080,1771279,for themselves i mean wink certainly has  a reputation for himself but like you  okay shun these players zika finding
IIp8Q5fssXk,1771279,1776799,themselves identities on this roster  they're becoming the stars of the show  instead of players like rookie in the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1776799,1782480,show yeah i think shun in particular  especially when shun was back on the  roster with the shy and rookie you can
IIp8Q5fssXk,1782480,1788640,see he was kind of being pulled around  by the veterans on the team but now that  he's been able to play his own game a  lot more i think he's shown that he's an
IIp8Q5fssXk,1788640,1795440,incredibly strong shooter  as i said we'll find uh some members of  blg but i think he's just been so
IIp8Q5fssXk,1795440,1802399,incredible with his path theme like the  fact that he's able to bring out these  massive carry performances like the fact  he's the highest damage percent on olive
IIp8Q5fssXk,1802399,1807919,ig as a jungler  speaks volumes to what he's doing  icon has taken the curse of the sad
IIp8Q5fssXk,1807919,1814880,mummy once again now this is scary  moment for ig wink is not scared though  he goes in i'll start taking a win goes
IIp8Q5fssXk,1814880,1820080,even deeper he was like two hp and he  goes in anyway blg handily finding an
IIp8Q5fssXk,1820080,1827840,advantage in this fight but shown on the  front line maybe it can turn around i'm  trying to get the resets here trying to  take the kills but they just don't have
IIp8Q5fssXk,1827840,1834799,the damage blg  find their moment off the back of which  aggression on turns one around health
IIp8Q5fssXk,1834799,1841120,bars are low that's a little dicey for  blg yeah on is only half health though  and i don't know if he can try and stop
IIp8Q5fssXk,1841120,1846240,this there's no tp available for 30  seconds until zika spawns and i mean on
IIp8Q5fssXk,1846240,1852080,has to make some sort of miracle play  here has the flash but needs to avoid  doggo  i mean doggo has to tank which means
IIp8Q5fssXk,1852080,1858480,they have no damage for the baron right  on might be able to find something  miraculous been on the front line is
IIp8Q5fssXk,1858480,1865279,about to turn mega this could be  disastrous for either team it's been  going down baron taken by blg and a tp
IIp8Q5fssXk,1865279,1872320,from icon to scare the kalista away  i  saw i know i knew no i know i knew that
IIp8Q5fssXk,1872320,1877679,on an auto attack  i'm being but jesus i thought he got the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1877679,1883760,barrel for a second like holy moly but  ig could have used this opportunity to  turn it over towards a dragon for
IIp8Q5fssXk,1883760,1890399,themselves but a massive win for blg in  that fight and unfortunately for wink  kind of going that bit too deep it
IIp8Q5fssXk,1890399,1896799,looked wonderful but they just ig  weren't in a position to try and follow  up on the plane we'll catch it here in  the replay
IIp8Q5fssXk,1896799,1903519,like it's a really good engage  using the minion as that kind of uh  moment to get in onto the back line but
IIp8Q5fssXk,1903519,1910080,doggo instantly cleanses and look how  far zika has to go forward before he can  even get any sort of damage off
IIp8Q5fssXk,1910080,1916080,i feel like wink had such a good engage  and that just goes again i'd like to get  hb it's like uh
IIp8Q5fssXk,1916080,1921840,i don't know about that one chief now  open the top side yuakai getting  absolutely annihilated again the goon
IIp8Q5fssXk,1921840,1929600,squad from blg  i don't even know how that one kicked  off i don't know how we ended up in that  situation but blg find themselves a tier
IIp8Q5fssXk,1929600,1935919,two off the back of it i know zhonya's  available for you kai there you can see  he's just about to come off a cooldown  so might have been able to get to the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1935919,1942159,safety of his tear and survive but now  you've got pushing lanes three or four  blg they get the top tier two firing up
IIp8Q5fssXk,1942159,1948240,creeps in the mid but look at that  bottom side of the map then trying to  shoot in that wave all the way in so ig
IIp8Q5fssXk,1948240,1954399,are able to put the majority of their  forces in the mid lane and would at  least defend that tier two for the  moment but a minute and a half still
IIp8Q5fssXk,1954399,1960159,left on this baron there's a lot more  waves that they have to contend with  certainly are way way actually having a
IIp8Q5fssXk,1960159,1966159,really good game for himself right now  seven three and five doing well on the  smites as well so far
IIp8Q5fssXk,1966159,1972000,we'll see if blg can finish this one up  two thousand gold lead fourth themselves  and i love
IIp8Q5fssXk,1972000,1978640,like  this game has forced blg to be proactive  has forced them to be ones making plays
IIp8Q5fssXk,1978640,1984640,an icon seems to have changed this team  for the better right now because they're  looking to get this first win on the
IIp8Q5fssXk,1984640,1990720,board in the series but they still have  to dot those ties and cross those tees  they haven't broken the base just yet
IIp8Q5fssXk,1990720,1996399,and i honestly i think icon is my mvp  for this game he he probably won't get  it because luebe has like seven and
IIp8Q5fssXk,1996399,2001840,three kills i think doggo's had his  protector game but the reason that this  game went the way it did is because of
IIp8Q5fssXk,2001840,2007360,those early roms from icon and the fact  he's in a lane against the rise where he  shouldn't actually be getting those rums
IIp8Q5fssXk,2007360,2013440,off shouldn't have control of the wave  states but still finds those moments  where yuukai is on a reset to push in a
IIp8Q5fssXk,2013440,2020159,wave go group of bot side like dropping  a one or two cs here and there to make  sure that his team succeeds like this is
IIp8Q5fssXk,2020159,2026720,what we're talking about for icon this  is why he's been such a good addition to  blg
IIp8Q5fssXk,2027279,2033840,wanted to clear vision there decides  against the end bikes away and rightly  so but i i totally agree icons
IIp8Q5fssXk,2033840,2040399,absolutely the mvp for me if vlg wins  this game  uh but there's still time on having a
IIp8Q5fssXk,2040399,2046080,pretty good game for himself for the  kalista almost fulfilled at this point  and i feel like these scraps have been
IIp8Q5fssXk,2046080,2051358,pretty damn close like if it just goes  slightly differently i can easily see ig
IIp8Q5fssXk,2051358,2056480,taking one of these spikes and suddenly  finding themselves back in control of  the game
IIp8Q5fssXk,2056480,2061679,yeah it's just the the problem is just  the scaling the blg are on like yes  you've got on who's nearly a full build
IIp8Q5fssXk,2061679,2067520,but doggo dirty uh finishing off his  rapid fire cannon as well like he's  getting very close to full build and
IIp8Q5fssXk,2067520,2074560,affilios for four items is so insanely  strong as well and when you look across  it like ig yes you got zika who's got
IIp8Q5fssXk,2074560,2080000,some great late game scaling working  towards the demonic embrace now as well  but i mean wayway is huge you've got
IIp8Q5fssXk,2080000,2086000,bean who's got good frontline crisp as  well it's just the value that this  enchanter brings to the table isn't it
IIp8Q5fssXk,2086000,2091599,goes found on that's big damage but not  enough big damage shield boat going to  be proc shun found in the jungle in the
IIp8Q5fssXk,2091599,2096878,meantime wink moving forward hostile  takeover is going to keep them in their  tracks right there wink can't move he
IIp8Q5fssXk,2096878,2104079,can't play that's gonna be the  cholesterol to keep him safe here and ig  get away by the skin of that teeth
IIp8Q5fssXk,2104079,2109680,huge amount invested there on both sides  though you've got shun having to use his  old wink even using the ultimate as well
IIp8Q5fssXk,2109680,2114720,just to buy space before he gets the  fates call so you got it now blg who
IIp8Q5fssXk,2114720,2120240,have higher health bars at least they  have to push in this wave will not have  any vision on this bottom side though as
IIp8Q5fssXk,2120240,2127119,the dragon is about to spawn in a minute  so they will take a bit of a quick reset  so they can try and establish some  control in river with all the waves now
IIp8Q5fssXk,2127119,2133520,pushed in  for in favor of blg  yeah one minute on this drake you can
IIp8Q5fssXk,2133520,2138560,see ig trying to push forward for vision  but there's no way there's no way they  can contest with yokai top side
IIp8Q5fssXk,2138560,2144079,currently recalling  zika  just about pushing that wave out but  it's not even going to hit the halfway
IIp8Q5fssXk,2144079,2150560,mark in the bottom lane it feels like ig  are losing ground here and struggling to  maintain control of their own jungle
IIp8Q5fssXk,2150560,2157359,strolling to maintain control of the mid  lane by the looks of things as shun gets  rooted by the graviton i love how  aggressive doggo has been this game
IIp8Q5fssXk,2157359,2162960,and that's who you need to get on to  here's ig if you hope to hold on to this  game it needs to be about getting onto
IIp8Q5fssXk,2162960,2169359,this affiliates but cleanses available  for doggo flash as well so even these  big ultimates if they're available for
IIp8Q5fssXk,2169359,2175839,wink  aren't gonna cut it you need more help  onto that backlit side and i'm we're  looking at yukai to see if you can maybe
IIp8Q5fssXk,2175839,2182400,have some sort of creative uh rifts um  that riff maker what's the realm warp  sorry that i'm looking at to see if he
IIp8Q5fssXk,2182400,2188720,can try and put his team into a position  where they can have multiple flank  angles and get on to taco
IIp8Q5fssXk,2188720,2193760,see if they can ig getting collapsed  upon here icon's got the curse of the  sad mummy can he get to the back line is
IIp8Q5fssXk,2193760,2200880,the question wink's gone down already an  answer trump or curse of the sadness blg
IIp8Q5fssXk,2200880,2207200,jump in the middle of everyone and zika  left alone in the world it's blg taking
IIp8Q5fssXk,2207200,2214320,the fight and taking the game  i don't know  what today is munch but if you told me
IIp8Q5fssXk,2214320,2220000,when i woke up that i was going to have  a blg series with more kills than there
IIp8Q5fssXk,2220000,2226400,are minutes in the game i would have  called you a goddamn liar but my god am  i happy that we exist in this universe
IIp8Q5fssXk,2226400,2232640,the thumbs down coming out from way way  here what a game blg
IIp8Q5fssXk,2232640,2238400,actually being proactive icon has  changed this team if he doesn't get an
IIp8Q5fssXk,2238400,2243520,mvp for that game  man  i'll be devastated he absolutely
IIp8Q5fssXk,2243520,2250480,deserves it yeah glock in my lap firing  on all cylinders today that man  absolutely insane being able to roam
IIp8Q5fssXk,2250480,2257359,around the map consistently like this  this was beautiful like this is what i  love to see like the blg are actually
IIp8Q5fssXk,2257359,2263280,bringing in this like and look i think  fofo is of incredibly strong curry but  bringing in icon and the fact that he's
IIp8Q5fssXk,2263280,2270400,getting these realms off he's actually  driving the early game for blg we talked  about how inco um important this
IIp8Q5fssXk,2270400,2276400,mid-jungle was going to be how important  it was for icon to try and steal the  realm warps look for plays and he was i
IIp8Q5fssXk,2276400,2281839,mean honestly he used every ultimate in  the other team better than they used  their own ultimates like his realm warps
IIp8Q5fssXk,2281839,2287599,were more impressive his curse to the  side mummies were more impressive like  honestly it was absolutely incredible to
IIp8Q5fssXk,2287599,2293119,see what he was able to achieve i will  say in winx defense he had some good  olds it was just the follow-up bandage
IIp8Q5fssXk,2293119,2299280,tosses that wasn't so good  what a game what a game and honestly
IIp8Q5fssXk,2299280,2304800,i wasn't super convinced by the icon  change like i preferred it over fofo but  i didn't i felt like it was gonna be
IIp8Q5fssXk,2304800,2311200,somewhat of a side grade i understand  the pitch now i understand the logic of  picking this guy up clearly plg needed a
IIp8Q5fssXk,2311200,2317280,leader and icon he's experienced this  guy's been around he's been playing for  six years or something like that like he
IIp8Q5fssXk,2317280,2323520,is the leader that apparently this team  needed because yes there are still  clearly some communication issues  they're not all necessarily on the same
IIp8Q5fssXk,2323520,2329839,page but you can see the beginnings of  something that could really work for the  squadron i'm on board that i'm
IIp8Q5fssXk,2329839,2336000,absolutely on board  especially when you've got so many  strong members on this team like when  you look at i mean the they've been the
IIp8Q5fssXk,2336000,2341280,super team like this team was the most  talked about when you came into spring a  lot of people had them like first if
IIp8Q5fssXk,2341280,2347599,about second if not first and then there  was a lot of other people like say raz  for instance were like no too many names
IIp8Q5fssXk,2347599,2352880,on this team you need to try and figure  something out and otherwise you are just  going to fall prey to everyone wanting
IIp8Q5fssXk,2352880,2358480,to try and be the big carrion that's  exactly what we saw for blg and but now  that you've kind of got icon coming in
IIp8Q5fssXk,2358480,2363599,who's willing to take that step back i  think crisp as well has been uh one of  the best support still that we have in
IIp8Q5fssXk,2363599,2369280,the league despite what's happening on  blg it looks like you're starting to see  a recipe for success it's just about
IIp8Q5fssXk,2369280,2374960,making sure that they've got the right  measurements for themselves when they go  in towards those team fights
IIp8Q5fssXk,2374960,2381520,yeah that's  that's the longest short of it right  it's whether or not they can all fulfill  the roles that they need to i'd say i'm
IIp8Q5fssXk,2381520,2387920,kind of impressed by icons damage quite  often you see silas numbers being fairly  low even in wins uh but actually dude
IIp8Q5fssXk,2387920,2392960,doing pretty well across the i mean i  think curse the sad moment helps because  that does big damage when you're using
IIp8Q5fssXk,2392960,2398880,it on stylus you're hitting everyone  but fantastic stuff honestly really  impressed by like i'm really impressed
IIp8Q5fssXk,2398880,2404800,by the team really impressed by the pro  activity i keep on saying it but i think  that's the most important thing is that
IIp8Q5fssXk,2404800,2409920,we've seen a different vlg today we've  seen them you know the realm warp to
IIp8Q5fssXk,2409920,2415520,dive on in the bottom lane and then just  group it up with that brush to just  re-kill on again like i love that kind
IIp8Q5fssXk,2415520,2422640,of creative play that's something i've  never seen from blg before  and i really like that they kind of
IIp8Q5fssXk,2422640,2428560,felt like understood what they had to do  with the draft that they had right like  doggo always going to be the the main
IIp8Q5fssXk,2428560,2434079,damage dealer in this draft so making  sure that once we saw doggo fall behind  in the early stages because let's be
IIp8Q5fssXk,2434079,2439920,realistic like he got battered those  first two levels like dying level one  then being pushed in a lane after he
IIp8Q5fssXk,2439920,2445680,came back two lane meant that he was  completely out of the out of the mix the  fact that then you get icon is like all
IIp8Q5fssXk,2445680,2452079,right cool don't worry guys i'm gonna  make sure that you can i can get you  across the finish line plays down  towards bot side gets a ton of kills for
IIp8Q5fssXk,2452079,2458079,uh doggo even allows him to get that  first terror uh blood on that bottom  side as well like that was so crucial
IIp8Q5fssXk,2458079,2463440,for doggo being relevant in this game  and i think that's why look i don't  think he will get mvp but i really think
IIp8Q5fssXk,2463440,2468480,icon should be mvp in this game  well doctor the last time i saw blg this
IIp8Q5fssXk,2468480,2473839,creative was back in 2020 when meteor  played maokai jungle it's been a long
IIp8Q5fssXk,2473839,2481319,time since that happened we'll see if  they can keep the creativity up in game  number two
