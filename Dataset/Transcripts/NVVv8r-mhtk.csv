NVVv8r-mhtk,0,4720,hey everybody welcome back to another episode of  me trying out sketchy art supplies that make me  
NVVv8r-mhtk,4720,9360,want to pull my hair out the art supplies that  i'm reviewing today they're from a little tiny  
NVVv8r-mhtk,9360,14480,not really well known small local i'm just kidding  they're not it's actually the complete opposite  
NVVv8r-mhtk,14480,20000,of that today i'm going to be reviewing art  supplies from the absolute behemoth of fast fashion  
NVVv8r-mhtk,20000,26080,shein.com shein is one of the biggest online  clothing retailers and they're known for being  
NVVv8r-mhtk,26080,31360,one of the cheapest places to buy clothes on  the internet recently shein.com has recently  
NVVv8r-mhtk,31360,37120,expanded past just selling clothes they sell  women's clothes men's clothes they sell makeup  
NVVv8r-mhtk,37120,44719,now stuff for pets and recently they started a  section for stationery aka art supplies and it's  
NVVv8r-mhtk,44720,50240,been about a year and a half since shein.com has  started selling stationery with art supplies and  
NVVv8r-mhtk,50240,56480,since that time i have gotten countless countless  people asking me to review their art supplies  
NVVv8r-mhtk,56480,64080,now i do have to say that before we get into this  video there is an absolute huge and i repeat huge  
NVVv8r-mhtk,64080,69200,disclaimer to this video i'm just gonna say it  completely flat uh shein definitely does not have a  
NVVv8r-mhtk,69200,76000,good reputation online at all shein unfortunately  is one of the biggest websites when it comes to  
NVVv8r-mhtk,76000,80480,fast fashion and probably one of the biggest  culprits because their prices are so cheap and  
NVVv8r-mhtk,80480,86240,fast fashion is basically this endless cycle where  something will go on trend the company will make  
NVVv8r-mhtk,86240,91759,it very cheaply very quickly we buy it wear it  for like three weeks throw it away and that whole  
NVVv8r-mhtk,91760,97200,entire cycle of just trying to keep up with the  fashion trends just never never ends until we die  
NVVv8r-mhtk,97200,102079,and besides the environment it's just not good for  your wallet it's not good for your self-esteem but  
NVVv8r-mhtk,102080,107120,one of the reasons this makes it so controversial  is because on the other hand there's a lot of  
NVVv8r-mhtk,107120,112400,people who are living paycheck to paycheck and  the only clothes they can afford is really cheap  
NVVv8r-mhtk,112400,117920,places like shein.com and maybe they live like  for example in an area where i do where there's  
NVVv8r-mhtk,117920,123200,like hardly any thrift shops available there's  maybe one or two clothing stores and they're just  
NVVv8r-mhtk,123200,129039,not able to afford like more high-end clothes that  are more sustainable it is a very controversial  
NVVv8r-mhtk,129039,134640,subject and i encourage everybody who is currently  watching this after this video watch a few video  
NVVv8r-mhtk,134640,139520,essays here on youtube just type in shein like  so many people have made videos about shein  
NVVv8r-mhtk,139520,143520,in fact i'll even link one down below that  goes over like both sides of the spectrum  
NVVv8r-mhtk,143520,148640,in the past before i knew about shein and how  problematic they were i definitely did used to  
NVVv8r-mhtk,148640,153760,shop at shein but ultimately after learning about  their past controversies i decided that working  
NVVv8r-mhtk,153760,159360,with shein and also purchasing from shein is just  not for me anymore so what you're about to see is  
NVVv8r-mhtk,159360,164240,my personal last time shopping from shein.com  and the biggest thing when it comes to fashion  
NVVv8r-mhtk,164240,169120,is that if you like something it makes you feel  good you spent your hard-earned money on that  
NVVv8r-mhtk,169120,174000,that's it that's all that matters it doesn't  matter if something's outdated or if it's cheugy 
NVVv8r-mhtk,174000,179680,or whatever as long as you like it it fits you  well and you love the way it feels that's all  
NVVv8r-mhtk,179680,185120,that should matter your individual style that you  make up will never go out of fashion because you  
NVVv8r-mhtk,185120,190159,made it okay and that's all period i know it only  seemed like a minute but i actually talked for 40  
NVVv8r-mhtk,190160,197840,minutes to my camera oh my gosh so let's go ahead  and start okay let's see what we're working with
NVVv8r-mhtk,200080,204800,okay so the first thing i want to say is right off  the bat i'm missing some items i ordered this like  
NVVv8r-mhtk,204800,209600,scratch paper that's like a scratch pad where you  scratch onto it and it shows the color underneath  
NVVv8r-mhtk,209600,214560,and looking through all of this stuff it's  not here and i haven't got any notifications  
NVVv8r-mhtk,214560,218560,of a refund or anything like that so right  off the bat they charged me for something  
NVVv8r-mhtk,218560,224160,that just isn't here all right so the first thing  that i want to try out that really caught my mind  
NVVv8r-mhtk,224160,230880,is this 10 piece random gel eraser it's basically  like a little tool that erases gel pen i only  
NVVv8r-mhtk,230880,238000,spent $1.50 cents and out of the 208 people that  have reviewed this it has four and a half stars  
NVVv8r-mhtk,238000,242880,and that's a reoccurring theme that you'll  see with shein is that everything is somehow  
NVVv8r-mhtk,242880,250766,suspiciously five stars here is my gel pen this  one is by gelly roll so let me rub on my gel pen
NVVv8r-mhtk,254560,260959,now supposedly these sticks are supposed to erase  the gel pen here's what they look like i don't  
NVVv8r-mhtk,260959,267520,know why they gave me 10 different pieces like  this is a package of this is a package of 10.  
NVVv8r-mhtk,267520,270960,so let's try this out oh my  nails i forgot to paint my nails  
NVVv8r-mhtk,271600,277821,oh my god sorry my plan is to erase a  straight line and we'll see if this works
NVVv8r-mhtk,282800,285520,am i doing something wrong or
NVVv8r-mhtk,289840,292880,i don't know if you guys can see that  it's kind of rubbing some of the glitter  
NVVv8r-mhtk,292880,298640,off onto the stick but it's not erasing it at all  maybe it's like whenever it's still wet it wipes  
NVVv8r-mhtk,298640,305609,it off so let me try let me try really quickly  if it when it's still wet okay it's still wet
NVVv8r-mhtk,310320,314560,maybe when they said gel pen maybe they just  meant like regular ballpoint pens so let me go  
NVVv8r-mhtk,314560,318480,get just like everyday run-of-the-mill  pen and we'll see if it erases that  
NVVv8r-mhtk,318480,321722,and this one should work so let's see
NVVv8r-mhtk,325440,329680,yeah no somehow i feel like this  one is even worse than the other one  
NVVv8r-mhtk,329680,335666,i'm gonna give it one more chance with just this  regular black pen and maybe just maybe it'll work
NVVv8r-mhtk,340400,345120,yeah okay this one's not working  at all either and i wanted these  
NVVv8r-mhtk,345120,351840,to work so bad i thought it was such a cool  thing but it's just like not gonna work sad  
NVVv8r-mhtk,353680,359199,now for this next item i'm not gonna lie it's  very cheap for what it is this is a six piece  
NVVv8r-mhtk,359200,364240,pencil shaped eraser and if you've never seen  it it's literally an eraser that's in the shape  
NVVv8r-mhtk,364240,370479,of a pencil i usually buy them from faber castell  and they usually run me about six dollars for one  
NVVv8r-mhtk,370480,375120,so to have six of these for only a dollar a  piece that's not that's actually not bad okay  
NVVv8r-mhtk,375120,380320,this has 69 reviews and of course it's  a perfect five stars so let's check it  
NVVv8r-mhtk,380320,386960,out so yeah right off the bat this isn't bad so  far uh the packaging appears to be pretty okay  
NVVv8r-mhtk,386960,393840,not beat up at all the pencils are very large  full size so far this doesn't seem bad at all
NVVv8r-mhtk,396560,398720,the top one will be my favorite castel my more  
NVVv8r-mhtk,398720,402986,high-end one and the bottom one  of course will be my shein one
NVVv8r-mhtk,409760,412160,that's a plot development i was not expecting  
NVVv8r-mhtk,414080,420000,the faber castell one is not erasing at  all as good as this like cheap shein one  
NVVv8r-mhtk,420720,427520,dude and i spent so much money on this but the  shein one erases completely and my favorite  
NVVv8r-mhtk,427520,435199,castel one is leaving a lot of like muddy texture  behind oh my gosh but on the other hand because  
NVVv8r-mhtk,435200,440880,this sheen eraser is really really hard it's  basically tearing up the paper underneath it but  
NVVv8r-mhtk,440880,446160,i'm not gonna lie i like the cheap price of these  so i'm gonna have to give these a 5 out of 10.
NVVv8r-mhtk,449600,453520,hi so it's currently the next day i ended  up taking a lunch break and then after that  
NVVv8r-mhtk,453520,458800,i just got too tired and fell asleep and i slept  for like 12 hours so i should be like completely  
NVVv8r-mhtk,458800,463840,revitalized at this point now for this next item  i just want to say that it was a really good price  
NVVv8r-mhtk,464400,469680,for this item i mean of course it was it's  shein.com this is a one-piece vintage drawing  
NVVv8r-mhtk,469680,476639,book it has 2 300 reviews and it was  only $3 so the thing that made me pick  
NVVv8r-mhtk,476640,480560,this sketchbook over other sketchbooks  that they offered is the fact that this  
NVVv8r-mhtk,480560,485360,is toned paper now if you don't know toned  paper is exactly what it sounds like it's  
NVVv8r-mhtk,485360,492000,paper that has coloring in it so that it's not a  perfect white but usually either a gray or a brown  
NVVv8r-mhtk,492000,496880,and as a result of the toned paper you're just  able to get a beautiful range from all the way  
NVVv8r-mhtk,496880,502080,to the darkest darks to the brightest highlights  and now that it came in i noticed that the book
NVVv8r-mhtk,504560,510800,is completely white paper i'm looking at  the reviews and a lot of the public reviews  
NVVv8r-mhtk,510800,515919,all of their paper isn't like a stark white  like this one is all of their paper is toned  
NVVv8r-mhtk,517840,522880,now as far as like the actual paper itself goes  i'm not gonna lie it's incredibly thin it's  
NVVv8r-mhtk,522880,527600,basically like the equivalent of printer  paper between like a cardboard backing  
NVVv8r-mhtk,528400,533840,the only problem that i personally find when it  comes to really thin paper like this is watch this  
NVVv8r-mhtk,537120,542400,i wrote my name and the second that i turn it  over it immediately bleeds through the next page
NVVv8r-mhtk,544880,549840,oh man so it didn't bleed through  just once it went one two three four  
NVVv8r-mhtk,551280,558080,five six pages it bled just like my handwriting  alone went through six different pages let's see  
NVVv8r-mhtk,558080,566560,how well this bad boy picks up an eraser uh so  yeah just as i suspected it is having a hard time  
NVVv8r-mhtk,566560,571200,picking up the eraser i'm kind of in disbelief  right now that it's not even erasing like the  
NVVv8r-mhtk,571200,576320,lightest touch that i did so i'm gonna perform  this exact same test on a piece of printer paper  
NVVv8r-mhtk,576960,581920,and i swear to god this one better not work better  than the shein one this literal printer paper  
NVVv8r-mhtk,583600,591279,oh my gosh okay no that's weird i performed  the exact same test on the printer paper and  
NVVv8r-mhtk,591280,598640,the actual cheap walmart printer paper is having  a much easier time erasing than the shein paper  
NVVv8r-mhtk,600160,604560,on the printer paper you can't even tell the  area where i like lightly shaded it because it  
NVVv8r-mhtk,604560,609040,was able to erase so well but that is absolutely  not the case when it comes to the shein paper  
NVVv8r-mhtk,609920,615200,oh my god i kind of feel bad for ragging on this  paper i'm going to give it one compliment to  
NVVv8r-mhtk,615200,621120,make sure its self-esteem stays up i really like  the cardboard flap on top i think this is really  
NVVv8r-mhtk,621120,626880,cool because you get to basically design your own  cover and i'm sure if you were very light-handed  
NVVv8r-mhtk,626880,632320,and maybe wanted to practice not messing up maybe  this book would be for you but for me personally  
NVVv8r-mhtk,632320,637440,the fact that it's having a hard time erasing the  fact that it's so thin it's kind of transparent  
NVVv8r-mhtk,637440,641760,just the fact that writing my name was able  to indent it through six different pages  
NVVv8r-mhtk,641760,645200,i just don't think this sketchbook  is worth the three dollars honestly  
NVVv8r-mhtk,645200,648560,if i had to rate this i would  probably say a four out of ten
NVVv8r-mhtk,651760,658480,now i have a few things left but before i get  to the absolute disaster of the last thing  
NVVv8r-mhtk,658480,662720,i want to end this on a second to high note  because there is one item that i think is just  
NVVv8r-mhtk,662720,666959,going to absolutely knock it out of the park  basically what this is is an all-in-one as you  
NVVv8r-mhtk,666960,672080,can see it has a palette it has a place to put  your brushes it has a place to clean your brushes  
NVVv8r-mhtk,672080,677040,and of course mix your paint and i hate that i'm  about to say this but this one is expensive coming  
NVVv8r-mhtk,677040,682000,in at $12 and when i say expensive i mean that  in the sense of shein because everything we've  
NVVv8r-mhtk,682000,689520,done has been i think under five dollars okay  so right off the bat this thing is pretty large  
NVVv8r-mhtk,689520,694160,for just like a normal palette i feel like this  one is pretty large already i'm pretty impressed  
NVVv8r-mhtk,694160,701022,with it the plastic feels very very thick it's  not easy to bend this is some good asmr right here
NVVv8r-mhtk,702880,709200,and again this is really thick just like me yeah  never mind it has 18 slots you can put your  
NVVv8r-mhtk,709200,713920,paint you can put your water in there and here  is where you keep your water you clean off your  
NVVv8r-mhtk,713920,719040,brushes on the inside it has ribs where you can  rub the brush it also has a really rough area for  
NVVv8r-mhtk,719040,723839,dry acrylic paint as you can see it has multiple  brush holders and i think you could even put some  
NVVv8r-mhtk,723840,730240,brushes on the inside in here like wet brushes  on the inside whoa talk about multifunctional
NVVv8r-mhtk,732800,733440,it's open
NVVv8r-mhtk,737360,744079,oh look at the princess can i can you bring  her so i could show everybody guys i got a new  
NVVv8r-mhtk,744080,754480,puppy and she got her jacketed look how nice  wow look how nice look how nice i just got her  
NVVv8r-mhtk,754480,757839,recently her name is chia  right now she's 12 weeks old  
NVVv8r-mhtk,759120,764080,so yeah i just wanted to share that I got a new  puppy but anyway let's try this thing out again  
NVVv8r-mhtk,764080,769520,so i'm going to put a little bit of green a  little bit of yellow in theory you would get  
NVVv8r-mhtk,769520,775280,your paint like this you would put it on this  section here to mix it up then you would paint  
NVVv8r-mhtk,775280,779360,paint paint paint and here's the real  test which is cleaning off the paint brush
NVVv8r-mhtk,783120,792240,moment of truth oh oh she's clean oh and then  once you're done you can like dry it off with  
NVVv8r-mhtk,792240,800080,this thing right here on the side and then oh  and i forgot to mention it has a little carrying  
NVVv8r-mhtk,800080,804560,case on top of that i like this one a lot  i'm going to give this one a 10 out of 10.  
NVVv8r-mhtk,807360,809760,now for this last item guys
NVVv8r-mhtk,813760,816240,i obviously had to open the  package whenever i was like  
NVVv8r-mhtk,817360,824240,getting all the stuff and i immediately saw this  item and how it came and i was so over it from the  
NVVv8r-mhtk,824240,833040,start so what this is this is a one sheet blackout  wall sticker it has 2485 reviews again almost a  
NVVv8r-mhtk,833040,838480,perfect five stars and i guess the price isn't  bad because it was only one dollar fifty cents  
NVVv8r-mhtk,838480,844959,you know which for a giant sticker this size i i'm  pretty okay with that but because shein only ships  
NVVv8r-mhtk,844960,850560,in bags look how this came in the mail so before i  show you this just remember it's supposed to be a  
NVVv8r-mhtk,850560,855840,sticker you're supposed to put it on your wall  stick it on completely flat and unfortunately
NVVv8r-mhtk,858160,863600,this is how it came it came completely  bent and it's not just in this one area  
NVVv8r-mhtk,863600,869839,it's like an entire 360 bend so let me open  this bad boy up and see what the situation is
NVVv8r-mhtk,873440,875200,oh let's see if it's so  
NVVv8r-mhtk,879600,884800,oh it came with chalk i thought i was gonna have  to run to walmart or something and go pick up some  
NVVv8r-mhtk,884800,889360,chalk okay cool that kind of makes up for it  all right so let's see how long this thing is
NVVv8r-mhtk,893600,897040,oh i thought it was gonna be way  longer on the picture it showed  
NVVv8r-mhtk,897040,901600,way way longer so this is how big it is  compared to the picture from what it showed
NVVv8r-mhtk,906880,912080,oh she is wrinkly i can't stick any of  this on the walls because my landlord  
NVVv8r-mhtk,912080,916400,will get very upset with me so i'm  just going to stick it to my desk
NVVv8r-mhtk,922640,924800,i guess because the sticker is so thin that  
NVVv8r-mhtk,924800,927120,once it's wrinkled it's just  always going to be wrinkled  
NVVv8r-mhtk,934320,941040,and i have a wet paper towel here let's see if i  can erase it okay yeah it erases very very well  
NVVv8r-mhtk,943440,948080,this paper feels very very thin if you've  ever felt true chalk paper you know that  
NVVv8r-mhtk,948080,953520,it's much thicker than this stuff right here but  i think when it comes down to shein everything  
NVVv8r-mhtk,953520,958640,that they make it seems that it's only meant  to be used for a very short amount of time  
NVVv8r-mhtk,958640,962640,because everything that i bought so far even  though they do work they're just so easy to  
NVVv8r-mhtk,962640,967280,destroy if that makes sense i can see somebody  buying this for like their kid but i feel like  
NVVv8r-mhtk,967280,971760,if you wanted to use this on a day-by-day  basis i feel like this would probably not be  
NVVv8r-mhtk,971760,980240,the best so if i had to rate this i would say  this is a 5 out of 10. now i know technically  
NVVv8r-mhtk,980240,985040,all of these things aren't necessarily art  materials they're more art supplies and tools  
NVVv8r-mhtk,985040,989680,so i'm gonna try to make a drawing with everything  included and we'll see what my final thoughts are
NVVv8r-mhtk,1055760,1060400,my final thoughts for shein.com besides  the fact that they're so controversial  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1060400,1067760,most of the art supplies it was just okay as far  as all of these art supplies go the quality is  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1067760,1071680,and i think this applies for the entirety  of shein it's just not made to last  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1071680,1076720,it's made to only be used a couple of times so  as far as like shopping exclusively at shein for  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1076720,1083200,art supplies i don't recommend it i enjoyed the  eraser pencils the palette and the tortillon and by  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1083200,1087840,the way i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to work  on this more i wish i would have had more time  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1087840,1092960,it's just that i am going to be moving this  week to a new state so yeah i'm sorry the  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1092960,1095919,videos have been so scarce lately  i've just been sick and then like  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1095920,1100560,moving if you guys want to see an empty house tour  please let me know down below and yeah with that  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1100560,1104400,being said i'll leave my broke artist playlist  here don't forget to like subscribe all that good  
NVVv8r-mhtk,1104400,1108320,stuff and with that being said i hope you have a  good day and i will see you guys next video bye
