-E3Ivekc3kI,96880,103840,you all have such big careers so there  really is a lot at stake here so did  anyone go back and forth on whether they
-E3Ivekc3kI,103840,109200,wanted to join and what ultimately made  coming back to all of this delightful  chaos worth it for all of you i still
-E3Ivekc3kI,109200,115280,haven't made up my mind  there was no question for me i mean
-E3Ivekc3kI,115280,122399,there was no prize money in england so i  was like how am i even if i come away  with 10 pounds i'm better off
-E3Ivekc3kI,122399,128879,how do you feel  the lady camden is the first uk queen to  win money on drag race i'm furious
-E3Ivekc3kI,128879,134400,i'm furious no i was absolutely nervous  to go back because you're like i don't  want to tarnish my reputation i won the
-E3Ivekc3kI,134400,139599,crown it's too late  you want to come back and do it but then  you get back into it you're like this
-E3Ivekc3kI,139599,145599,show is crazy chaotic but it is fun yeah  i jumped at the chance because i just  wanted people to remember me
-E3Ivekc3kI,145599,151519,wait who are you again she's still alive  who are you  you know honestly i thought i definitely
-E3Ivekc3kI,151519,158959,weighed the option of going because i  was like i didn't really have a lot of  time to like get more confident and like  travel and like really be confident as a
-E3Ivekc3kI,158959,165599,winner and so i was like but you know  what this is a second shot go and get it  mama because i think too
-E3Ivekc3kI,165599,172640,being a pandemic winner is a very  different experience and i think it's so  bomb that you know you got to come back
-E3Ivekc3kI,172640,178800,and show jada 2.0  i definitely changed my mind because  after the edit of uh mine and monet's
-E3Ivekc3kI,178800,185680,win where it looked like it was on  facetune um i was like i don't know  about this but here i am i was just
-E3Ivekc3kI,185680,192800,excited  i was excited to show what i've done  with my drag in the last like 10 or so
-E3Ivekc3kI,192800,200000,year decade i'll say 20 years  20 years yes  leave that party in
-E3Ivekc3kI,200000,206400,i mean this is that's cute and all but i  mean the real reason that we are all  gathered here today is just to get monet  in the same room as an actual british
-E3Ivekc3kI,206400,211920,person so that you can make your case  about the true british accent and its  evolution to vivian's face so please
-E3Ivekc3kI,211920,219360,just hash it out i would love to see it  okay so like i said on season 10 we had  the voice first it we was all copacetic
-E3Ivekc3kI,219360,224799,then y'all try to move and be cute and  then y'all change it up and that's what  happened you have to know give me your  brain
-E3Ivekc3kI,224799,230159,this is the british accent this is how  they spoke in december  just before we started filming you were
-E3Ivekc3kI,230159,234319,like vivian listen to my british accent  mom
-E3Ivekc3kI,235519,240439,what's that what's that money exchange  of barney which one
-E3Ivekc3kI,244850,251840,[Applause]  [Laughter]
-E3Ivekc3kI,251840,258320,we clearly could go on about this all  day but in all seriousness i mean legacy  is really important and i want to know
-E3Ivekc3kI,258320,265120,if it was more important for you all to  give fans what you think more of what  they originally fell in love with on
-E3Ivekc3kI,265120,270880,your seasons or did you try to lean into  giving them something that would  surprise them and be bigger on all
-E3Ivekc3kI,270880,276720,winter seasons coming back the second  time and doing it all over again you are  a lot more yourself and a lot more
-E3Ivekc3kI,276720,282560,relaxed so i think  no matter which of us are up here we've  all shown an another side of who we are
-E3Ivekc3kI,282560,289040,and i know at least like for me it felt  different  being like a three-peat offender with
-E3Ivekc3kI,289040,296000,you know monet and trinity i feel like  you know you go back on all-stars and  you really want to write all the wrongs
-E3Ivekc3kI,296000,302800,and you know really show people what  you're worth but i feel like coming back  for a third time it was really for me
-E3Ivekc3kI,302800,309600,just like i just want to have fun  because i love drag race you know i just  wanted to go on to uh manipulate my edit
-E3Ivekc3kI,309600,316320,and yell at people  control the story huh  collusion and we also got the chance to
-E3Ivekc3kI,316320,321360,introduce viv to in-n-out burger  and she lived as you will see me get
-E3Ivekc3kI,321360,327199,slightly wider throughout the season  [Laughter]
-E3Ivekc3kI,327199,333360,and leave a bit more  now for this next question you cannot  say yourself you have to say someone
-E3Ivekc3kI,333360,339199,else on the cast whose performance this  season do you think will surprise fans  the most and who slayed hardest on the
-E3Ivekc3kI,339199,344639,runway i gotta say i want to say first i  think evie i am so excited for the fans
-E3Ivekc3kI,344639,349759,to see what miss evelyn oddly pulls out  also her face she tried some new stuff
-E3Ivekc3kI,349759,356319,for her face and it was awful  and she would like we would all get  finished at the at the makeup mirrors
-E3Ivekc3kI,356319,363199,and we she would turn around we're all  like oh my god you look funny stunning  can i say one more i already had high
-E3Ivekc3kI,363199,371360,expectations  but they were absolutely raja exceeded  them so much like just really truly blew
-E3Ivekc3kI,371360,376800,me away and like not to kiss her ass  either but raja was the first real girl
-E3Ivekc3kI,376800,381919,that i really fell in love with on  season three she's the og fashion queen
-E3Ivekc3kI,381919,387120,she really comes and proves why she is  the og fashion queen not only was she
-E3Ivekc3kI,387120,392560,fierce competition but then also like  super compassionate super understanding
-E3Ivekc3kI,392560,397600,i call her my spiritual guru now i come  to her for medical for medical advice i
-E3Ivekc3kI,397600,403600,come to her  my stars say to me  i come to her about everything and she
-E3Ivekc3kI,403600,409039,always has the most brilliant advice for  me so yeah i love you i'm also going to
-E3Ivekc3kI,409039,414639,say jada because jada had like a  revolving door  like she got off of one season and had
-E3Ivekc3kI,414639,421280,to get right back on another  so i feel like we had the least amount  of time to get to know jada since her
-E3Ivekc3kI,421280,426560,last season  um and she really you know delivered  i've looked up to trinity for absolutely
-E3Ivekc3kI,426560,433400,years as she is a drag queen's drag  queen the runways we know they're going  to come but when you see them i mean
-E3Ivekc3kI,433400,439840,mind-blowing but even in challenges like  just watching you pull stuff out but i  don't think you even knew you had thank
-E3Ivekc3kI,439840,447038,you it was amazing to watch she hates it  when we talk nice about her  you're gonna ruin my reddit reputation
-E3Ivekc3kI,447520,453039,are you talking about my lips or my  butthole  i mean clearly yes you all did excellent
-E3Ivekc3kI,453039,458639,i mean look at the material we have here  you all look wonderful today but given  how big this season's talent is it makes
-E3Ivekc3kI,458639,465599,sense that there are changes to the way  that the game is played so without  spoiling um when you heard what the
-E3Ivekc3kI,465599,471199,alterations were can you describe what  your immediate reaction was
-E3Ivekc3kI,471199,477199,i hated it i wanted it to not be how it  was at the beginning and then it's then  we were got into the game and i was like
-E3Ivekc3kI,477199,484960,oh i do like it she's hot and she's cold  i love this so much because i feel like  it gives the fans of the show
-E3Ivekc3kI,484960,490240,an opportunity that they've never ever  ever seen in drag race history i liked
-E3Ivekc3kI,490240,495840,it and i think it's the reason i said  yes my first reaction was wow what a
-E3Ivekc3kI,495840,501199,great idea but then knowing that it's  rupaul's drag race i was like but what's  the cat
-E3Ivekc3kI,501199,506319,and then when we got there that's when  we found out the catch so everybody did
-E3Ivekc3kI,506319,512959,so phenomenal  the twist  is what's going to keep the fans on  their toes for sure there are many
-E3Ivekc3kI,512959,519039,iconic snatches here some that landed in  the bottom but how much pressure was  there for prep on snatch game this time
-E3Ivekc3kI,519039,524880,around both for those who did well  originally and those who didn't do well  originally it's hard you go back to
-E3Ivekc3kI,524880,530720,another season as a winner of snatch  game and i think michelle visage the  comment on my season was it was the best
-E3Ivekc3kI,530720,536000,snatch game she'd ever seen so i was  just like well i'm gonna do this and
-E3Ivekc3kI,536000,541040,hope for the best because i don't i  didn't feel like i could live up to it  you know the pressure of going from
-E3Ivekc3kI,541040,546640,another country to then you can be great  at snatch game but as soon as rupaul  walks in that room it's a completely
-E3Ivekc3kI,546640,552880,different scenario you know you can be  as so prepared but it goes poof and then  you're down to your quick way and
-E3Ivekc3kI,552880,560959,whatever you pull out  to me to me it was more like  the pressure of doing snatch game with
-E3Ivekc3kI,560959,566240,winners like because here it was like  everybody was strong and so you have to
-E3Ivekc3kI,566240,572880,be  super specific and super good at what  you're doing if you want to do well i  mean i i was nervous i was literally
-E3Ivekc3kI,572880,580000,going against five winners jinx won hers  trinity won hers shea won hers  on earth roger did you win yours no but
-E3Ivekc3kI,580000,586480,you were really good  excellent excellent safe  so there was like some really i was like
-E3Ivekc3kI,586480,592399,all these people are so good at snatch  game and haircut old whitney houston  girl trying to try to get
-E3Ivekc3kI,592399,599920,snatch game this season was kind of like  a you're if you do or  if you don't can i say i'm saying it um
-E3Ivekc3kI,599920,605920,because either you feel like you have to  like erase  your
-E3Ivekc3kI,605920,612560,your previous performance or you have to  outdo it we all just had to pick people  we were really excited to play right
-E3Ivekc3kI,612560,618800,like  good or bad we all had a lot of fun that  day  we were insane definitely have to do a
-E3Ivekc3kI,618800,625360,double take this match game  raja um you are also competing against  some of your victims here on fashion
-E3Ivekc3kI,625360,631360,photo review so did any of these ladies  have feedback for you when you first uh
-E3Ivekc3kI,631360,638480,came together for all winners i mean i  was a little terrified walking in you  know i was expecting huge huge attitudes
-E3Ivekc3kI,638480,644560,and um maybe spiteful  daggery maybe a bludgeon or i don't know
-E3Ivekc3kI,644560,649600,i didn't i was i was a little scared  it's not too late  sure today has the knife
-E3Ivekc3kI,649600,656560,yeah yeah yeah i'm totally i really just  came in being like raja my name's not  sean
-E3Ivekc3kI,660079,666959,well raja to keep the spirit alive can  we toot and boot the looks on the on the  table here right now let's keep it easy
-E3Ivekc3kI,666959,673040,boots  all of you  i feel like the bar was so low for me i
-E3Ivekc3kI,673040,678720,had nowhere to go but  we agree
-E3Ivekc3kI,678720,684720,i mean how did the all-stars 5 drama  around the alleged campaign changed the
-E3Ivekc3kI,684720,691920,way you navigated your sisters in a  competitive environment my style as a  competitor is really to just focus on
-E3Ivekc3kI,691920,697200,trying to be my best self and not worry  about what other people are doing and if
-E3Ivekc3kI,697200,702560,girls wanted to do a campaign to try and  send me home this time i knew that the  fans would do their due diligence and
-E3Ivekc3kI,702560,708240,tear their asses apart so i slept well  at night  um what what is the drama like this
-E3Ivekc3kI,708240,715200,season the egos are huge the the drama  was more of like we are business women
-E3Ivekc3kI,715200,723440,and we are in control more of like what  we want so it was more of like getting  these people behind the cameras together
-E3Ivekc3kI,723440,728480,yeah i think honestly the biggest drama  was us being like where's my phone
-E3Ivekc3kI,728480,734970,it was like eight internal battles all  happening in the same room at the same  time and that's just her personalities
-E3Ivekc3kI,734970,740320,[Laughter]  i will say this being my third time back
-E3Ivekc3kI,740320,746480,in the drag race i was like you know  what i'm just ready to have fun yeah i  mean strategy because i will say as  someone who who's watches a lot of drag
-E3Ivekc3kI,746480,751760,race all the franchises and all-stars  i'm like watching it i'm like i want  them to be shady and send powerful
-E3Ivekc3kI,751760,756800,people home q uk versus the world i love  that they were being so shady and made
-E3Ivekc3kI,756800,762240,such good tv so i wanted to i felt that  energy i'm like let's create chaos  that's not fine what is your interviews
-E3Ivekc3kI,762240,769279,going to be like you're confessionals  monetary do you like that ugly
-E3Ivekc3kI,770000,776639,and i are friends  monet jada shea and i mean evie who is
-E3Ivekc3kI,776639,782160,not here i mean many have described this  group as part of what is referred to as  the melanin dynasty i mean including
-E3Ivekc3kI,782160,787519,five black queens to win consecutively  from monet through to simone what weight
-E3Ivekc3kI,787519,794079,does that hold for you not only as  queens in this franchise but also just  as as human beings um for me i don't
-E3Ivekc3kI,794079,799519,feel like there's a weight to it i just  feel like  in order for us especially for us to
-E3Ivekc3kI,799519,804959,impact people who look like us it is  important for us to be our most  authentic selves i know for a fact that
-E3Ivekc3kI,804959,810000,just being ourselves we have made a lot  of change in in the lives of other  people and i hope that we can continue
-E3Ivekc3kI,810000,815760,to do so i love being my whole black  self on tv and now since even since all  stars four there's just so much more
-E3Ivekc3kI,815760,821519,access working with people like edward  scissorhands who can give me hairstyles  and rock and adorn and look the way i
-E3Ivekc3kI,821519,827600,want on tv so going back for this all  winter season i felt so good and i feel  even more so empowered walking down the
-E3Ivekc3kI,827600,834800,runway and projecting what i want people  to see um for me and my little big old  black booty like i had said on all stars
-E3Ivekc3kI,834800,842000,five that  my drag in its purest form is a love  letter to black women i really felt like
-E3Ivekc3kI,842000,847920,coming back and doing this all winter  season for me was an opportunity to just  continue writing that letter now monet
-E3Ivekc3kI,847920,855839,and trinity i mean fans are going to be  asking if you are both doing this to  settle the thai win once and for all did
-E3Ivekc3kI,855839,862160,that factor into your decision to do  this or did you actually feel compelled  to maybe join forces in an alliance
-E3Ivekc3kI,862160,868160,because of the time  go ahead answer it  i don't think there's anything to settle
-E3Ivekc3kI,868160,873279,because this is there's two different  competitions there's all stars four  which
-E3Ivekc3kI,873279,878480,was that was that we we completed that  and this is a whole new venture whole
-E3Ivekc3kI,878480,884560,different rules two different  entertainers that have evolved since  all-stars i don't think there's anything
-E3Ivekc3kI,884560,891920,to settle it's just something different  the rules are different the way we  compete is different i'm so proud of  myself and i'm so proud of my twitter
-E3Ivekc3kI,891920,897600,for what she was able to do this season  as well i mean i'm just excited to to  watch as a fan yeah there's nothing to
-E3Ivekc3kI,897600,903600,settle girl we both got our own money  our own crown our own scepter this house  i bought some gucci bags like like
-E3Ivekc3kI,903600,909199,people just you do you got your money  you did your thing and weird there's no  animosity there's no i'm i'm gonna
-E3Ivekc3kI,909199,915199,settle the score with you trinity like  it's not it's nothing none of that now  jada you you said before that you didn't
-E3Ivekc3kI,915199,921120,always feel like fans necessarily held  your victory in the same regard as other  winners so what do you mean by that and
-E3Ivekc3kI,921120,927920,did a spot on this cast make you feel  differently about how much you are  valued after winning my season there was
-E3Ivekc3kI,927920,933839,a lot of um  a lot of the fans who were upset that i  had won the show it did feel a little
-E3Ivekc3kI,933839,939279,weird for me but i think coming in the  room with with these girls oh and i  don't want to get emotional because you
-E3Ivekc3kI,939279,945199,know i'm a crybaby um but every single  one of them in that work room made me
-E3Ivekc3kI,945199,950240,feel like a star everybody was  we were all so supportive of each other
-E3Ivekc3kI,950240,956079,and to me that it made me feel like a  winner just to see people that i've  always admired in the work that they've
-E3Ivekc3kI,956079,961360,always done  show me so much respect you could be a  hard-working you can be sickening but
-E3Ivekc3kI,961360,968680,you can also have like heart and be a  nice person you are a star thank you
-E3Ivekc3kI,969360,974560,i mean jada you had a hometown parade  literally  this and you know what the thing about
-E3Ivekc3kI,974560,979680,the parade was it was so weird because  at home like not necessarily always have
-E3Ivekc3kI,979680,985759,i felt like i had the most support from  home  but to see like everybody come out  especially during the pandemic and be
-E3Ivekc3kI,985759,991199,like regardless if we have to sit in our  cars and drive past and show you support  for what you've done we're going to make
-E3Ivekc3kI,991199,998079,sure you know that we are proud of what  you've done and so it felt good and like  i said again being in the work room with  these girls they not that they were like
-E3Ivekc3kI,998079,1004079,yeah you're a winner like us it was like  we're proud of you for being a winner  and i felt like we've each felt that for

-E3Ivekc3kI,1053520,1059360,raja and jinx i do want to ask you a  little bit about because your seasons  were earlier so um
-E3Ivekc3kI,1059360,1066160,i know shocker right um  how much did re-entering the competition  how much did the competition change from
-E3Ivekc3kI,1066160,1072640,seasons three and five so it's hard to  compare the two but going back into the  realm of competition
-E3Ivekc3kI,1072640,1078000,and the way that drag race has grown and  the fan base has grown  and the way
-E3Ivekc3kI,1078000,1084480,people pay attention to drag race now  versus how it was  back then i felt like i had a lot to
-E3Ivekc3kI,1084480,1090400,live up to  and i felt like i had a lot to like um  bone up on
-E3Ivekc3kI,1090400,1096799,with some of the girls who have competed  two or three times some of the girls who  were just doing it i felt like i really
-E3Ivekc3kI,1096799,1104160,had to um you know  get the rust off and shake it out  well season three was you know it was in
-E3Ivekc3kI,1104160,1110320,drag race itself was in such primitive  stage is like  in my particular season it was more
-E3Ivekc3kI,1110320,1117520,about creating things we were constantly  doing these balls where we had to sew  glue constant constant every challenge
-E3Ivekc3kI,1117520,1123919,and this time i actually got to have fun  and shine a little bit with the acting  challenges and the writing and the
-E3Ivekc3kI,1123919,1129200,comedy and things that i and dancing i  did some dancing
-E3Ivekc3kI,1129200,1135440,you know and  and drag race drag race now  drag race says drag race has created a
-E3Ivekc3kI,1135440,1142559,culture and now an industry you know  whereas when i was on it no one had a   lace front you know
-E3Ivekc3kI,1142559,1148720,so it was it's a very very different  world but they haven't been invented yet
-E3Ivekc3kI,1148720,1157640,i mean  [Laughter]
-E3Ivekc3kI,1159430,1165840,[Applause]  was precise
-E3Ivekc3kI,1166160,1172240,given everyone's reaction to when raja  said she was dancing what what does  everybody think of raja's dancing
-E3Ivekc3kI,1172240,1178320,i love raja's dancing  it is unique not afraid to reference
-E3Ivekc3kI,1178320,1184640,very different very interesting and uh  very herself it is interpretive
-E3Ivekc3kI,1184640,1191679,interpretive  you're gonna have to interpret that i  think a lot of fans out there will  identify with rajasthan so i want to
-E3Ivekc3kI,1191679,1197200,know a little bit from you shay about  having naomi campbell as a runway coach
-E3Ivekc3kI,1197200,1202320,um i know that moment was really  meaningful for you so can you tell me  what that was like to have naomi
-E3Ivekc3kI,1202320,1209679,critiquing your runway walk and what it  meant for you what she said after i like  i'm like trembling right now just think
-E3Ivekc3kI,1209679,1214720,because for first of all see like i'm  like stuttering there are very few
-E3Ivekc3kI,1214720,1220159,people  that i get starstruck around because you  know it's just like people are people
-E3Ivekc3kI,1220159,1225520,but naomi campbell is a goddess okay and  i
-E3Ivekc3kI,1225520,1232640,i  i  have looked up to naomi  since i was like four years old i
-E3Ivekc3kI,1232640,1238159,remember seeing her in michael jackson's  out of the closet video and being like  wow who is this powerful
-E3Ivekc3kI,1238159,1243200,beautiful statuesque black woman with  this cascading locks whatever she is i
-E3Ivekc3kI,1243200,1249600,want to be her and to have her  sit there and first of all just see me
-E3Ivekc3kI,1249600,1256480,walk  and say that  she would give no  notes on my
-E3Ivekc3kI,1256480,1262960,see like i'm it's so stupid i'm so but  like to hear those words from someone  like naomi campbell i
-E3Ivekc3kI,1262960,1269600,that is honestly one of the most  affirming moments i've ever had in my  life and i'm just so grateful that i got  to have that opportunity did anyone
-E3Ivekc3kI,1269600,1275200,actually like take the things that she  said and like actually incorporate  incorporate them into their runway walks
-E3Ivekc3kI,1275200,1280240,going forward absolutely not she seemed  ill-informed  [Laughter]
-E3Ivekc3kI,1280240,1286880,yes yes i did she said she loved my  runway walk so i just continued  doing it yeah i was okay this is a thing
-E3Ivekc3kI,1286880,1294480,i may or may not have had critiques but  i was  very busy looking at her beautiful hair  and face and shining beautiful skin i
-E3Ivekc3kI,1294480,1301360,don't know what happened  i don't know she's  i'll tell you this she was looking
-E3Ivekc3kI,1301360,1307840,delicious  [Music]  you've heard of models making their own
-E3Ivekc3kI,1307840,1313200,wind  when she was doing her runway walk she  was making her own wind and that
-E3Ivekc3kI,1313200,1319720,virgin baby remy hair honey was just  she
-E3Ivekc3kI,1319840,1326400,you feel that impact when she walk  because like she's creating that wind  but it's almost like a cross breeze
-E3Ivekc3kI,1326400,1331760,because i felt like i was being blown  away at the same time too it was just  and the hair was so perfect she would
-E3Ivekc3kI,1331760,1338640,like touch her face and it would go  and she would sneeze and he went  yeah it was crazy
-E3Ivekc3kI,1338640,1343919,beautiful  each strand was like one of those things  at the car wash
-E3Ivekc3kI,1343919,1350799,yeah it was crazy it was  nice cameron diaz unretired herself for  drag race so what was that like having
-E3Ivekc3kI,1350799,1356000,her on set  she looked beautiful  so up close and untucked like
-E3Ivekc3kI,1356000,1363840,i was like and she seemed like a fan of  the show like yeah some judges that come  on don't seem to be present but she was
-E3Ivekc3kI,1363840,1370799,like very knowledgeable she knew who we  were she knew what to look for she was  there and she looked stunning and she
-E3Ivekc3kI,1370799,1376159,was super nice i loved it i was glad to  see her there because when we were doing  season 12 and it was approaching the
-E3Ivekc3kI,1376159,1381760,finale her and leslie jones were both  like on alive and they were just talking  and leslie said well girl at the end of
-E3Ivekc3kI,1381760,1387600,the day who are like who do you think is  going to win she said no question jada  look at her and i'm like gag and then
-E3Ivekc3kI,1387600,1393120,she showed up and like even from that  moment i could tell how invested she was  in the show so to know that she was
-E3Ivekc3kI,1393120,1400000,there like oh we have a judge who's not  she's not gonna be giving fluff and just  saying things like she is invested and
-E3Ivekc3kI,1400000,1405919,she know like like trinity said she had  had known every single one of us she had  known our journey our personal struggles
-E3Ivekc3kI,1405919,1411440,with the show and every single thing so  it was so good to like have a judge that  was not like not just to be like a guest
-E3Ivekc3kI,1411440,1417039,judge like oh we would love to see her  but to see somebody that's there that  was like so heavily invested in to also
-E3Ivekc3kI,1417039,1422480,want to see us be successful that when  she gave us advice  i just wanted to take it all in and like
-E3Ivekc3kI,1422480,1428679,apply it to myself yeah there's  something about  cameron
-E3Ivekc3kI,1436480,1442640,you are the season's only international  winner um from a different international  franchise i know we've spoken a lot
-E3Ivekc3kI,1442640,1449200,before about the differences in american  and british drag but was it different  competing amongst a bunch of american
-E3Ivekc3kI,1449200,1457039,queens oh my god it was the most  nerve-wracking thing i mean just getting  on a plane coming all this way
-E3Ivekc3kI,1457039,1463919,walking into that work room with the  biggest drag personalities possibly on  the planet and it took me a few weeks to
-E3Ivekc3kI,1463919,1469840,really find my stride because you know  this as an english person this is how i  speak so being around trinity he was
-E3Ivekc3kI,1469840,1476880,like girl i'll live oh my god i need  some rhinestones  it's like wow i've got to compete with
-E3Ivekc3kI,1476880,1482000,you know because yes it's a huge drag  competition but we're making tv as well  so you know i was just kind of getting
-E3Ivekc3kI,1482000,1487520,in my you know i was getting my little  face on and mate and there's all this  and so finding the balance of like not
-E3Ivekc3kI,1487520,1492640,trying to scream and get my time but  just have a ball and then i realized it
-E3Ivekc3kI,1492640,1497679,took me like week three i was like oh my  god they're just rotted horrible drag
-E3Ivekc3kI,1497679,1503200,queens just like me and different  accents with the different accents
-E3Ivekc3kI,1503200,1509760,so i did did feel right and honestly got  like you know did we all see eye to eye  all the way through the season no it's
-E3Ivekc3kI,1509760,1515360,drag race did we all leave as an amazing  family absolutely i can ring any one of
-E3Ivekc3kI,1515360,1521120,these girls on any time of the day you  know i've been been to see jinx the  minute she was in the in the uk i was
-E3Ivekc3kI,1521120,1529320,there cheering her on thinking what can  i take her what british snacks hasn't  she eaten yet turns out none
-E3Ivekc3kI,1529760,1536000,but it's i mean i just absolutely love  that and it's been the best experience i  told you not to call my husband a
-E3Ivekc3kI,1536000,1543200,british snack  [Laughter]  oh we get a drink jinx is married we
-E3Ivekc3kI,1543200,1549550,know  you can't forget it you had it first you  had it right the first time drink drink  drink was married
-E3Ivekc3kI,1549550,1556799,[Music]  [Laughter]
-E3Ivekc3kI,1556799,1562640,vivian what was the i mean you know  american conservatives are an  interesting group online to say the
-E3Ivekc3kI,1562640,1568559,least so i did what was the reaction  like to your donald trump snatch game  from american conservatives online i've
-E3Ivekc3kI,1568559,1574159,got the worst memory and data i can't  remember if trump was president by the  time i'd done it yes
-E3Ivekc3kI,1574159,1580480,yeah but it was like  i don't think the people who had voted  for him realize what they'd done but i  think by the time snatch game came out
-E3Ivekc3kI,1580480,1586159,they kind of had so i think they were on  my side  because it was like do i go in uh you
-E3Ivekc3kI,1586159,1591279,know snatch game is all about making  roulette you know donald trump was the  most famous person on the planet at that
-E3Ivekc3kI,1591279,1598320,time so i was like i'm doing it i'm  doing it and there was i think people  saw that i was taking the piss out of
-E3Ivekc3kI,1598320,1605120,him and making him look even more  foolish than he was making himself look  so it's hard which is very hard but it
-E3Ivekc3kI,1605120,1610960,was great it was fantastic  that was hard watching you do it no i so
-E3Ivekc3kI,1610960,1616080,to the group i want to ask you know as  the most glistening royals in this  queendom of all the queens from the
-E3Ivekc3kI,1616080,1622400,franchises around the world which rue  girl do you think best represents the  future or the next generation of where
-E3Ivekc3kI,1622400,1628159,drag is heading oh  wow i i think  i there's no right or wrong answer
-E3Ivekc3kI,1628159,1633840,because if you look at this panel drag  is literally  anything and everything and you can't
-E3Ivekc3kI,1633840,1640880,say going forward  drag is going to be this because drag  will always be so many different things
-E3Ivekc3kI,1640880,1647279,and so i don't think there's a right  answer for that i think that  every girl that is added to the
-E3Ivekc3kI,1647279,1652480,franchise brings something different the  great thing about the show as well is  you know you can get given a brief of a
-E3Ivekc3kI,1652480,1657840,runway and then you think you've caught  like the most crazy thing or you think  ever and then you you line up to walk
-E3Ivekc3kI,1657840,1663279,the runway and go oh my god you're crazy  how did you even think about it and then  you've got evie over there doing
-E3Ivekc3kI,1663279,1669600,whatever the that is but it's the  most fashionable thing you've ever seen  you know it's like everyone has such a
-E3Ivekc3kI,1669600,1675520,unique there's no right or wrong way to  do drag whoever you you know i  as long as you're expressing yourself
-E3Ivekc3kI,1675520,1683120,and you walk out that door and you're  amazing but just do it well i've noticed  even in my own drag that things have
-E3Ivekc3kI,1683120,1688640,changed just by watching the show and  like the way that we do it like like she  said it's going to be a melting pot of
-E3Ivekc3kI,1688640,1694480,you have trans people who have been a  part of drag forever but now the world  is realizing that you have so many
-E3Ivekc3kI,1694480,1700080,different people that are doing drag now  and if you're not used to that then  maybe you better get used to it and get  with it because that's what it's going
-E3Ivekc3kI,1700080,1706640,to be and there's so many different  types of drag that hasn't been on the  show yet yeah like bearded even more
-E3Ivekc3kI,1706640,1712240,obscure club kids so many different  types of drag i encourage people
-E3Ivekc3kI,1712240,1718320,if you are a fan of drag race become a  fan of drag and do your research
-E3Ivekc3kI,1718320,1724159,and support local entertainers  drag is an art form and art has to be
-E3Ivekc3kI,1724159,1730080,able to evolve and adapt and reflect the  community that it's serving and i think
-E3Ivekc3kI,1730080,1737039,you know  we see a direct cause and effect between  the lgbtq plus community and what's
-E3Ivekc3kI,1737039,1742399,important to us as a community it  immediately gets reflected in drag drag  is
-E3Ivekc3kI,1742399,1748399,unique to the queer experience whether  you're queer or you're an ally or you're
-E3Ivekc3kI,1748399,1754480,queer adjacent like i say for some  people  in all seriousness drag race and dragons
-E3Ivekc3kI,1754480,1760000,has opened my eyes to so many different  directors that i did not know were out  there that were so accessible and drag
-E3Ivekc3kI,1760000,1766240,is really is like the queer super bowl  we love we love consuming it people  complain about their too many seasons
-E3Ivekc3kI,1766240,1772240,and we watch each and every one of them  drag is this explosion we are all we're  also lucky to live in this time where
-E3Ivekc3kI,1772240,1778320,dragons being celebrated the way that it  is and  my hope and i'm sure everyone else is  that going forward that it gets even
-E3Ivekc3kI,1778320,1784000,bigger that drag queens are performing  at the grammys direct drag queens are  winning oscars like i i see that for
-E3Ivekc3kI,1784000,1789520,drag and i know that we can all do it  and i'm happy to be a part of a legacy  that can make that happen to close this
-E3Ivekc3kI,1789520,1794880,out though i would like to you know all  stars always does open with a reading  challenge so i thought we would close
