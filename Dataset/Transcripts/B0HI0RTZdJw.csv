B0HI0RTZdJw,34079,36239,now first up today not the most
B0HI0RTZdJw,36239,38559,interesting type thing but maybe from
B0HI0RTZdJw,38559,39840,the market for something like this you
B0HI0RTZdJw,39840,41920,might like it this is a laser tape
B0HI0RTZdJw,41920,44000,measuring tool from hodo photo tools
B0HI0RTZdJw,44000,46719,makes some really cool stuff and this
B0HI0RTZdJw,46719,48239,like i said if you're in the market for
B0HI0RTZdJw,48239,50559,a laser tape measuring tool might really
B0HI0RTZdJw,50559,52640,come in handy forget the days of pulling
B0HI0RTZdJw,52640,55039,out a ruler or a tape measure with this
B0HI0RTZdJw,55039,57199,it's all done via the built-in laser
B0HI0RTZdJw,57199,58719,once you turn it on you just point the
B0HI0RTZdJw,58719,60000,laser at whatever subject you're
B0HI0RTZdJw,60000,61600,measuring like the distance of how far
B0HI0RTZdJw,61600,63760,away it is press the button again and
B0HI0RTZdJw,63760,65518,then right there on the display it'll
B0HI0RTZdJw,65518,68240,tell you and it's accurate down to 1 16
B0HI0RTZdJw,68240,70880,of an inch so very accurate and as you
B0HI0RTZdJw,70880,72560,can see i did a quick little demo for
B0HI0RTZdJw,72560,74799,you guys i had the lens 15 inches away
B0HI0RTZdJw,74799,78640,and it shows 1 foot 3 inches and 1 16.
B0HI0RTZdJw,78640,80400,now to reiterate this is not meant for
B0HI0RTZdJw,80400,82240,you to physically like measure something
B0HI0RTZdJw,82240,84000,in the air like this it's meant from
B0HI0RTZdJw,84000,86479,point a to point b you point the laser
B0HI0RTZdJw,86479,88479,and it shows you right here it also
B0HI0RTZdJw,88479,90560,shows you on your phone if you download
B0HI0RTZdJw,90560,92240,the app it's not necessary at all but if
B0HI0RTZdJw,92240,94320,you do download it it will store all
B0HI0RTZdJw,94320,95920,your recent measurements that you have
B0HI0RTZdJw,95920,97759,once connected via bluetooth and then
B0HI0RTZdJw,97759,99840,from there what's really cool is you can
B0HI0RTZdJw,99840,102159,physically map out dimensions of say
B0HI0RTZdJw,102159,104720,like your room for example so i now have
B0HI0RTZdJw,104720,106640,the physical dimensions of my studio i
B0HI0RTZdJw,106640,108560,went from wall to wall mapped it all out
B0HI0RTZdJw,108560,110720,and it's there in the app real time so
B0HI0RTZdJw,110720,112320,while we show off the more you know like
B0HI0RTZdJw,112320,113920,gaming tech gadgets and stuff on the
B0HI0RTZdJw,113920,115680,channel this definitely strays a bit
B0HI0RTZdJw,115680,117280,away from that but it's still pretty
B0HI0RTZdJw,117280,119200,cool i've never seen a laser tape
B0HI0RTZdJw,119200,120719,measure tool like this before and the
B0HI0RTZdJw,120719,122560,fact that it is so accurate like i said
B0HI0RTZdJw,122560,125119,down to 1 16 of an inch is pretty damn
B0HI0RTZdJw,125119,128000,crazy so definitely a nifty little tech
B0HI0RTZdJw,128000,131280,gadget and it comes in just around 35
B0HI0RTZdJw,131280,133760,did i spike the lens enough for you guys
B0HI0RTZdJw,133760,135200,all right so even though they're not a
B0HI0RTZdJw,135200,137040,sponsor i want to remind you guys that
B0HI0RTZdJw,137040,138959,all the cool tech 150 products that i've
B0HI0RTZdJw,138959,141280,showed off for the last three plus years
B0HI0RTZdJw,141280,143920,i have archived on my luster profile
B0HI0RTZdJw,143920,145360,i'll drop the link to that down below
B0HI0RTZdJw,145360,147599,but literally three plus years worth of
B0HI0RTZdJw,147599,149840,cool tech under 50 items all archived
B0HI0RTZdJw,149840,151280,and categorized nicely for you guys if
B0HI0RTZdJw,151280,153040,you want to check out recent stuff all
B0HI0RTZdJw,153040,155360,in my luster profile now next up is a
B0HI0RTZdJw,155360,157760,really cool desktop gadget definitely
B0HI0RTZdJw,157760,159599,timely as well this was actually
B0HI0RTZdJw,159599,161840,suggested by a fan i believe aaron on
B0HI0RTZdJw,161840,163920,our last live stream this from sharper
B0HI0RTZdJw,163920,166480,image is a desktop fan and light bar and
B0HI0RTZdJw,166480,167680,i figured now you know it's getting
B0HI0RTZdJw,167680,169680,hotter summers here it's the perfect
B0HI0RTZdJw,169680,171599,time to show it off for you guys so from
B0HI0RTZdJw,171599,173760,sharper image it's called the axis 16
B0HI0RTZdJw,173760,175840,air bar and the built-in fan has three
B0HI0RTZdJw,175840,177599,different speeds as well as the light
B0HI0RTZdJw,177599,179200,bar that has three different brightness
B0HI0RTZdJw,179200,180640,levels and all the buttons are touch
B0HI0RTZdJw,180640,182879,sensitive and the fan itself has a full
B0HI0RTZdJw,182879,185280,360 degree pivoting head so you can move
B0HI0RTZdJw,185280,186720,it and position it really wherever you
B0HI0RTZdJw,186720,188800,want angle it so it you know cools you
B0HI0RTZdJw,188800,191040,down and i'll tell you what for the 16
B0HI0RTZdJw,191040,193200,inch size it works pretty damn well it
B0HI0RTZdJw,193200,195040,definitely cooled me off pretty quickly
B0HI0RTZdJw,195040,196800,and again i figured with summer coming
B0HI0RTZdJw,196800,199120,up say maybe like your hands get sweaty
B0HI0RTZdJw,199120,201200,while you're gaming or something why not
B0HI0RTZdJw,201200,203760,have this perfectly positioned desktop
B0HI0RTZdJw,203760,205840,fan with a light built in right in front
B0HI0RTZdJw,205840,207280,of your peripherals so it can keep those
B0HI0RTZdJw,207280,209920,hands from getting clammy and all nasty
B0HI0RTZdJw,209920,211360,it's not loud either it's definitely
B0HI0RTZdJw,211360,212640,more on the quiet side which i was
B0HI0RTZdJw,212640,214560,pretty surprised by and again i just
B0HI0RTZdJw,214560,216400,love these multi-devices like this
B0HI0RTZdJw,216400,217920,because not only is it a fan like i said
B0HI0RTZdJw,217920,220000,it has the light built in so definitely
B0HI0RTZdJw,220000,221760,a pretty cool gadget and also it comes
B0HI0RTZdJw,221760,223200,with a vertical stand so if you don't
B0HI0RTZdJw,223200,225120,want to have this physically laying on
B0HI0RTZdJw,225120,226720,your desktop you can just put it in the
B0HI0RTZdJw,226720,228640,corner or on the side or something and
B0HI0RTZdJw,228640,231360,stand it up vertically so many use cases
B0HI0RTZdJw,231360,233599,digging the functionality so again shout
B0HI0RTZdJw,233599,234959,out to aaron for suggesting this on the
B0HI0RTZdJw,234959,236560,last live stream dude if you don't have
B0HI0RTZdJw,236560,238000,one already hit me up i'll totally buy
B0HI0RTZdJw,238000,239920,you one this is being highly considered
B0HI0RTZdJw,239920,241840,for my cool tech under 50 hall of fame
B0HI0RTZdJw,241840,243519,especially at the more than affordable
B0HI0RTZdJw,243519,245599,price of just 37
B0HI0RTZdJw,245599,247040,i'm sure a lot of you can find this not
B0HI0RTZdJw,247040,249519,only useful but probably a necessity for
B0HI0RTZdJw,249519,251680,your desktop or your gaming setup and
B0HI0RTZdJw,251680,253280,speaking of your gaming setup i'm sure a
B0HI0RTZdJw,253280,254640,lot of you if you're a fan of the
B0HI0RTZdJw,254640,256320,channel are probably also keyboard
B0HI0RTZdJw,256320,259120,enthusiasts so why not blend the two and
B0HI0RTZdJw,259120,261600,have a key switch power button for your
B0HI0RTZdJw,261600,264720,pc so this little 12 desktop power
B0HI0RTZdJw,264720,266720,switch lets you use a mechanical key
B0HI0RTZdJw,266720,269600,switch to turn on off and reset your pc
B0HI0RTZdJw,269600,271120,definitely satisfying to have that
B0HI0RTZdJw,271120,272960,tactile click when you want to turn on
B0HI0RTZdJw,272960,274880,or off your computer so this obviously
B0HI0RTZdJw,274880,276880,is an external power switch doesn't go
B0HI0RTZdJw,276880,278560,into your pc or anything like that and
B0HI0RTZdJw,278560,280560,getting it hooked up is very simple so
B0HI0RTZdJw,280560,282240,you know those annoying little pins in
B0HI0RTZdJw,282240,284080,the bottom of your pc it connects your
B0HI0RTZdJw,284080,285600,case to the motherboard yeah that's
B0HI0RTZdJw,285600,287600,called your front panel pins or your f
B0HI0RTZdJw,287600,291040,panel or as i like to call it stupid
B0HI0RTZdJw,291040,292720,anyways that's where this connects so
B0HI0RTZdJw,292720,294639,you unplug your current case pins you
B0HI0RTZdJw,294639,296320,plug in the power pins as well as led
B0HI0RTZdJw,296320,298160,pins as well that's literally it it'll
B0HI0RTZdJw,298160,300320,take like two seconds once you figure
B0HI0RTZdJw,300320,302000,out where it goes on your motherboard
B0HI0RTZdJw,302000,303600,again every motherboard is different and
B0HI0RTZdJw,303600,305360,then just like that you can now use this
B0HI0RTZdJw,305360,307360,mechanical switch instead of your cases
B0HI0RTZdJw,307360,309039,power switch this will let you position
B0HI0RTZdJw,309039,310720,it and put it really wherever you want
B0HI0RTZdJw,310720,313680,the cable itself is stupid long like way
B0HI0RTZdJw,313680,315199,longer than it needs to but i also
B0HI0RTZdJw,315199,316479,thought it was cool because now you can
B0HI0RTZdJw,316479,318400,use really like whatever keycap you want
B0HI0RTZdJw,318400,319919,to kind of personalize it and match your
B0HI0RTZdJw,319919,321199,setup so if you have like artisan
B0HI0RTZdJw,321199,322960,keycaps for example it's an extra cool
B0HI0RTZdJw,322960,324240,way to kind of show that off and
B0HI0RTZdJw,324240,326080,integrate it into your desktop i don't
B0HI0RTZdJw,326080,327840,know maybe your pc is farther away from
B0HI0RTZdJw,327840,329199,where you actually sit at your gaming
B0HI0RTZdJw,329199,331039,setup this here will let you you know
B0HI0RTZdJw,331039,333840,turn your pc on and off easier i guess
B0HI0RTZdJw,333840,335440,more convenient in that sense maybe
B0HI0RTZdJw,335440,336560,you're about to get caught in the act
B0HI0RTZdJw,336560,337680,and you want to quickly shut down your
B0HI0RTZdJw,337680,338960,pc to make it seem like you weren't
B0HI0RTZdJw,338960,341039,doing anything hey i'm just throwing out
B0HI0RTZdJw,341039,343280,scenarios you get the idea though it's a
B0HI0RTZdJw,343280,345120,simple little gadget like i said 12
B0HI0RTZdJw,345120,347680,dollars a nice clicky mechanical switch
B0HI0RTZdJw,347680,349360,put a cool keycap on there put it
B0HI0RTZdJw,349360,351120,wherever you want on your desktop it
B0HI0RTZdJw,351120,352560,comes with sticky pads so you can mount
B0HI0RTZdJw,352560,354240,it as well and i'll just have it at an
B0HI0RTZdJw,354240,356800,easier arm's reach again 12 bucks super
B0HI0RTZdJw,356800,358160,affordable
B0HI0RTZdJw,358160,359840,next up again if you're a fan of the
B0HI0RTZdJw,359840,363600,channel you know i am a huge fan of one
B0HI0RTZdJw,363600,365680,thing and one thing in particular that
B0HI0RTZdJw,365680,367440,usually makes it to the series we find
B0HI0RTZdJw,367440,369280,it really cool i'll give you a second to
B0HI0RTZdJw,369280,371680,vote now
B0HI0RTZdJw,372479,374720,yeah if you guessed a or b you're 100
B0HI0RTZdJw,374720,377360,correct but from piketty we have his
B0HI0RTZdJw,377360,378840,brand new
B0HI0RTZdJw,378840,382720,r26 macro pads and these as you can see
B0HI0RTZdJw,382720,383759,are dope
B0HI0RTZdJw,383759,385680,so these are 26 macro pads could
B0HI0RTZdJw,385680,387520,definitely bump up your productivity or
B0HI0RTZdJw,387520,389280,even your gaming obviously with the
B0HI0RTZdJw,389280,390960,macro pad you guys in the routine by now
B0HI0RTZdJw,390960,392960,but you could set these to be anything
B0HI0RTZdJw,392960,395440,you want hotkeys for gaming quick tools
B0HI0RTZdJw,395440,397360,for photo editing video editing desktop
B0HI0RTZdJw,397360,399440,media control literally anything you
B0HI0RTZdJw,399440,401280,want it's all programmable and here we
B0HI0RTZdJw,401280,403680,have this nice navy and gold version as
B0HI0RTZdJw,403680,405360,well as a transparent white version with
B0HI0RTZdJw,405360,407680,the rgb lights on each side of the macro
B0HI0RTZdJw,407680,410160,pad you have four keys so eight total
B0HI0RTZdJw,410160,412160,plus a big old knob right in the middle
B0HI0RTZdJw,412160,414160,you always clutch volume dial or use it
B0HI0RTZdJw,414160,416800,to adjust your brush size in photoshop
B0HI0RTZdJw,416800,419120,you get the idea and i am a big fan of
B0HI0RTZdJw,419120,421280,the shard 3d printed case it's called
B0HI0RTZdJw,421280,422800,has this really nice and cool looking
B0HI0RTZdJw,422800,424960,geometric sort of design to it it's just
B0HI0RTZdJw,424960,427039,very unique looking and all together for
B0HI0RTZdJw,427039,429120,the purpose it serves pretty compact as
B0HI0RTZdJw,429120,430400,well i mean like it's not that much
B0HI0RTZdJw,430400,431599,bigger than your gaming mouse for
B0HI0RTZdJw,431599,434400,example so for under 50 the r26 comes as
B0HI0RTZdJw,434400,436080,a kit you can't get it assembled for
B0HI0RTZdJw,436080,437360,more but again it's going to cost you
B0HI0RTZdJw,437360,438639,some extra money and then from there you
B0HI0RTZdJw,438639,440080,can choose your switches whether you
B0HI0RTZdJw,440080,442479,want cherry switches kale got clicky
B0HI0RTZdJw,442479,444400,linear tactile pick whatever switch you
B0HI0RTZdJw,444400,446000,want then to customize it not only can
B0HI0RTZdJw,446000,447599,you pick your keycaps you can pick what
B0HI0RTZdJw,447599,449440,color you want your keycaps to be same
B0HI0RTZdJw,449440,451120,story with the knob pick the material
B0HI0RTZdJw,451120,452800,and color of your knob and then for the
B0HI0RTZdJw,452800,455120,3d printed case you can choose a bunch
B0HI0RTZdJw,455120,457039,of colors as well and also choose
B0HI0RTZdJw,457039,458400,whether you want it to be like a flat
B0HI0RTZdJw,458400,460639,design or the shard geometric design
B0HI0RTZdJw,460639,462639,like we have here so tons of
B0HI0RTZdJw,462639,465199,customization altogether the kit comes
B0HI0RTZdJw,465199,467680,to just under 50 bucks again depending
B0HI0RTZdJw,467680,469599,on how you configure it it could be more
B0HI0RTZdJw,469599,472720,but insanely cool absolutely love stuff
B0HI0RTZdJw,472720,474319,like this if you want to configure it
B0HI0RTZdJw,474319,476400,you can use vial which is the software
B0HI0RTZdJw,476400,478639,that'll let you reprogram and remap the
B0HI0RTZdJw,478639,480479,buttons and the dial to be whatever you
B0HI0RTZdJw,480479,483199,want functions pretty much endless
B0HI0RTZdJw,483199,485680,customization here you can check it out
B0HI0RTZdJw,485680,487440,and again just 50 bucks for the kit i
B0HI0RTZdJw,487440,490080,think is more than fair just considering
B0HI0RTZdJw,490080,491599,the endless possibilities of what you
B0HI0RTZdJw,491599,493680,can set these keys and the knob to be
B0HI0RTZdJw,493680,495440,every gaming setup needs a cool macro
B0HI0RTZdJw,495440,496319,pack
B0HI0RTZdJw,496319,499039,so again just really crazy cool and
B0HI0RTZdJw,499039,501039,innovative from piketty love these
B0HI0RTZdJw,501039,503599,desktop macro pads like this and also if
