8ZhoeSaPF-k,60,5310,A study was conducted in 1998 at Columbia University by a professor
8ZhoeSaPF-k,5310,9150,Claudia M Mueller she took a large group of fifth graders
8ZhoeSaPF-k,9150,13110,and had them work on numerous puzzles by themselves now these were very
8ZhoeSaPF-k,13110,17849,challenging puzzles but regardless of how well each child did he or she was
8ZhoeSaPF-k,17850,21990,told that they scored very well that they did better than most of the other
8ZhoeSaPF-k,21990,26460,kids afterwards half of these students were told that they scored high because
8ZhoeSaPF-k,26460,30090,they worked hard while the other half were told that it was all because they
8ZhoeSaPF-k,30090,33570,were smart and gifted then they presented each student with three more
8ZhoeSaPF-k,33570,38160,types of puzzles to work on easy ones medium difficulty ones and extremely
8ZhoeSaPF-k,38160,42870,challenging ones and what they found was very interesting the students who were
8ZhoeSaPF-k,42870,46710,told that they did well because they were smart spent the majority of their
8ZhoeSaPF-k,46710,50520,time on the easy puzzles they spent almost no time on the extremely
8ZhoeSaPF-k,50520,55559,challenging puzzles and spent much less time overall trying to solve any of the
8ZhoeSaPF-k,55559,60329,puzzles which was a sign of lower levels of motivation and to top it all off when
8ZhoeSaPF-k,60329,63899,asked whether or not they enjoyed the experiment they said that it wasn't that
8ZhoeSaPF-k,63899,67740,fun for them on the other hand the students who were told that they did
8ZhoeSaPF-k,67740,71548,well because they worked hard spent the majority of their time focused on the
8ZhoeSaPF-k,71549,75780,harder puzzles they also spent a lot more time overall attempting to solve
8ZhoeSaPF-k,75780,80520,any of the puzzles which was a sign of an increase in levels of motivation and
8ZhoeSaPF-k,80520,85258,to top it all off after the experiment they said that they actually enjoyed the
8ZhoeSaPF-k,85259,89549,entire experience so what can we learn from this study well there's a concept
8ZhoeSaPF-k,89549,94049,called the locus of control which is essentially the degree to which you
8ZhoeSaPF-k,94049,98070,believe you have control over your life the kids who were told that they did
8ZhoeSaPF-k,98070,102000,well because they were smart and gifted were led to believe in what's called an
8ZhoeSaPF-k,102000,105509,external locus of control they were led to believe that factors
8ZhoeSaPF-k,105509,110399,outside of what they could control where the reason they did well right you can't
8ZhoeSaPF-k,110399,114509,control whether or not you're born smart on the other hand the kids were told
8ZhoeSaPF-k,114509,118290,they did well because they worked hard started to believe in what's called an
8ZhoeSaPF-k,118290,122070,internal locus of control they believed that it was factors they
8ZhoeSaPF-k,122070,126420,controlled that led to their outcomes it was their hard work and their extra
8ZhoeSaPF-k,126420,130679,effort that allowed them to do well on the puzzles right because how much work
8ZhoeSaPF-k,130679,133370,you put into something is something that you have
8ZhoeSaPF-k,133370,137420,complete control over now studies on the locus of control like this one have
8ZhoeSaPF-k,137420,143000,found time and time again that having an internal locus of control is the key to
8ZhoeSaPF-k,143000,147110,staying motivated you must feel like you have control over your life and that you
8ZhoeSaPF-k,147110,150560,are responsible for the things that happen to you if you want to feel
8ZhoeSaPF-k,150560,155120,motivated all of the time I saw this happen with my own eyes back in the day
8ZhoeSaPF-k,155120,159230,when I was in charge of a sales team this wasn't retail sales or car sales
8ZhoeSaPF-k,159230,164209,this was old-school door-to-door sales which has one of the highest turnover
8ZhoeSaPF-k,164209,168620,rates most people only last a week before quitting see you need to be an
8ZhoeSaPF-k,168620,173120,extremely motivated individual to be able to face hundreds and hundreds of
8ZhoeSaPF-k,173120,177440,rejections every single day before someone even considers buying something
8ZhoeSaPF-k,177440,181640,from you now over time I was able to develop a keen eye for who would
8ZhoeSaPF-k,181640,186200,actually last who I should spend more time and energy training all I had to do
8ZhoeSaPF-k,186200,190519,was ask a simple question when a new salesperson on my team was confronted
8ZhoeSaPF-k,190519,195379,with their first bad day a day in which they made no sales I would ask him why
8ZhoeSaPF-k,195379,199160,do you think you made no sales today and I would see how they would respond if
8ZhoeSaPF-k,199160,202489,they blame things like the weather the fact that it's a weekend and nobody
8ZhoeSaPF-k,202489,205819,wants to be bothered on the weekends or because it was the neighborhood I would
8ZhoeSaPF-k,205819,210950,instantly know that they wouldn't last because they had an external locus of
8ZhoeSaPF-k,210950,214280,control they believed that the reason they couldn't make any sales was because
8ZhoeSaPF-k,214280,219139,of factors outside of their control and because of this they spent less time
8ZhoeSaPF-k,219139,223489,knocking on doors which was ultimately the real reason why they weren't making
8ZhoeSaPF-k,223489,227840,any sales that's the curse of having an external locus of control when you feel
8ZhoeSaPF-k,227840,231829,like nothing you do matters you stop working you stop trying
8ZhoeSaPF-k,231829,236239,cuz what's the point of trying when the worlds conspiring against you right so
8ZhoeSaPF-k,236239,240199,how do we adopt an internal locus of control so that we can start feeling
8ZhoeSaPF-k,240199,243680,motivated all of the time well they found that the best way to do so is by
8ZhoeSaPF-k,243680,247340,simply solving problems in your own life and then taking some time in
8ZhoeSaPF-k,247340,251359,appreciating the fact that it was your actions that solve this problem I'll
8ZhoeSaPF-k,251359,255198,give you an example just to make things more clear let's say you're someone who
8ZhoeSaPF-k,255199,259070,struggles with falling asleep so you go do some research and you find out if you
8ZhoeSaPF-k,259070,262760,get some more sunlight in the morning if you only use your bed for sleeping and
8ZhoeSaPF-k,262760,265190,if you install a blue light filter on your phone
8ZhoeSaPF-k,265190,270030,that should drastically increase your to sleep faster when bedtime comes
8ZhoeSaPF-k,270030,274620,around you do all of those things and lo and behold you find yourself sleeping 15
8ZhoeSaPF-k,274620,278040,minutes faster than before when you notice this improvement you need to say
8ZhoeSaPF-k,278040,282690,to yourself wow it was because of the changes I made because of the effort I
8ZhoeSaPF-k,282690,286770,put in that I am now able to sleep better it's that simple build up that
8ZhoeSaPF-k,286770,290789,belief that you are in control of your destiny that you have an internal locus
8ZhoeSaPF-k,290790,294000,of control and you will never have issues with motivation in your life
