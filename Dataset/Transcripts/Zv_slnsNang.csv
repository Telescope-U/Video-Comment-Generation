Zv_slnsNang,2480,8240,[Music]  quincy jones discovered me
Zv_slnsNang,8240,14320,and it's so interesting to me because  when i was uh working as a television  news woman in baltimore
Zv_slnsNang,14320,19359,and really all i wanted to do was be an  actress but i was doing television and i  felt
Zv_slnsNang,19359,26080,at the time  i can't quit this job because this is  what everybody else wants to do
Zv_slnsNang,26080,31760,and if i quit this job what am i going  to do and i was going to a speech coach
Zv_slnsNang,31760,38160,at the time that the station had sent me  to they you know they have the  broadcasting school they sent everybody  the same woman and i was telling her you
Zv_slnsNang,38160,43520,know i really don't want to do this what  i really want to do is act and she says  my dear you don't want to act because if
Zv_slnsNang,43520,49840,you wanted to act you'd be doing it what  you want to be my dear is a star  because  if you wanted to act you'd be waiting
Zv_slnsNang,49840,56800,tables in new york you'd be and i  thought now why am i going to wait  tables if i'm already working in tv  so i said well what i think is going to
Zv_slnsNang,56800,64158,happen  is i will be discovered because i want  it so badly somebody's going to have to  discover me and she said you just dream
Zv_slnsNang,64158,70560,you dream you're a dreamer so when it  happened i called her up i said you  would not believe this
Zv_slnsNang,70560,76479,i got discovered  and it really was a discovery it's like  one of those lana turner stories only
Zv_slnsNang,76479,81840,i wasn't a drugstore he was uh in his  hotel room saw me on tv it was  unbelievable
Zv_slnsNang,81840,87040,the interesting thing about that is that  i truly believe that
Zv_slnsNang,87040,92880,thoughts  are the greatest vehicle to change  power
Zv_slnsNang,92880,100560,and success in the world everything  begins with thoughts i mean the chairs  that we're sitting in the room that  we're in all started because somebody
Zv_slnsNang,100560,107040,thought it  so  i thought up the color purple for myself  i know this is going to sound strange to
Zv_slnsNang,107040,114479,you i read the book  i i got so many copies of that book i  passed the book around everybody i knew
Zv_slnsNang,114479,119520,if i was on the bus i'd pass it out to  people  and  when i heard that there was going to be
Zv_slnsNang,119520,126560,a movie i started i started talking it  up for myself i didn't know quincy jones  or steven spielberg or how on earth i
Zv_slnsNang,126560,132319,would get in this movie i'd never acted  in my life  but i i felt it so intensely that i had
Zv_slnsNang,132319,138239,to be a part of that movie i just  i really do believe i created it for  myself i wanted it more than anything in
Zv_slnsNang,138239,143520,the world and would have done anything  to do  it the biggest message i want to get
Zv_slnsNang,143520,150720,across when it comes to the law of  attraction is that it requires  effort it requires some type of action
Zv_slnsNang,150720,157599,that's why in the word attraction you  see action in the word you don't just  get to write down something on a piece
Zv_slnsNang,157599,163360,of paper or have a vision board or you  know map something out or cut out photos  and and look at it in front of you every
Zv_slnsNang,163360,168720,single day or write down things on a  piece of paper and think hard about it  for a few minutes and then expect
Zv_slnsNang,168720,174480,everything in your life to change and to  be this magnet of opportunities to have  everyone that you want in your life
Zv_slnsNang,174480,180560,attracted to you  money good health opportunities with  your career that's not going to happen
Zv_slnsNang,180560,187440,overnight like that  and i wish it did but it's not that easy  so there are some beliefs and actions
Zv_slnsNang,187440,193440,that we need to take  place in order for it to work and that's  what we're going to do by diving into
Zv_slnsNang,193440,199280,today so the first thing you want to  think about is switching from negativity  to positivity
Zv_slnsNang,199280,205440,so many people get caught up in focusing  on what they don't want to happen in  their future and i want to talk about
Zv_slnsNang,205440,211200,this a little bit towards the end of  this video on how to focus on  some of the negative things that could
Zv_slnsNang,211200,216640,happen but really focusing on the  positive for the main part of your life  we'll talk about that towards the end
Zv_slnsNang,216640,224080,because this is an important distinction  but they start living almost in constant  fear of what could go wrong and what
Zv_slnsNang,224080,229840,won't work out and when we come from  this place of well i don't know if i put  myself out there you know it's not gonna
Zv_slnsNang,229840,235840,work out and then i'm gonna get made fun  of and then people i'm gonna be  embarrassed and i'm gonna be stressed  and no one's gonna love me and then we
Zv_slnsNang,235840,241280,go in this rabbit hole and this  kind of cycle of fear and anxiety and
Zv_slnsNang,241280,248159,that is not  how you attract good things in your life  you can't  start from your way of being of
Zv_slnsNang,248159,253439,negativity and fear and expect to  attract beautiful things in your life
Zv_slnsNang,253439,258479,so we we need to eliminate the negative  self-talk and an environment that's easy
Zv_slnsNang,258479,264560,to get stuck in sometimes can be the  negative self-talk and there's so much  negativity in the world and if you don't
Zv_slnsNang,264560,271120,actively work to shift your focus to  shift your thoughts and your mind that  negativity will consume you and that's
Zv_slnsNang,271120,276400,where the law of attraction comes in now  for me it's about focusing less
Zv_slnsNang,276400,283280,on what i don't want to happen in the  future and actually focus on what i do  want and again i think a lot of people
Zv_slnsNang,283280,289520,focus on what they don't want too much  and you start to attract the things  you're thinking about i don't want this
Zv_slnsNang,289520,295360,i don't want that those things start to  come to you you start to see them  it's like the exalt example if someone
Zv_slnsNang,295360,301120,says you know don't think of a pink  elephant you start to see it and you  start to imagine it you say well i don't
Zv_slnsNang,301120,306639,want to be poor you start to feel it and  you start to imagine it and you start to  have anxiety around it so you want to
Zv_slnsNang,306639,313759,really think about the positive things  in your life you want to think about  what do i want to attract who do i want  to become what do i want to overcome so
Zv_slnsNang,313759,320400,for example if you're becoming a  negative person you're more likely to  attract more negative people rather than
Zv_slnsNang,320400,327120,positive ones because positive people  won't want to be around you you know  negativity keeps company and so does
Zv_slnsNang,327120,332720,positivity when you start to see other  positive people that are like you you  say i want to hang out with those people
Zv_slnsNang,332720,338560,those people are going to continue to  lift me up i can lift them up it's a  good cycle but the negative stuff you
Zv_slnsNang,338560,344960,start to attract when you talk about  gossip and you talk about bad news when  you talk about comparison and judgment
Zv_slnsNang,344960,350639,and anxiety and stress  that feeds in a community of other  people that speak in the same language
Zv_slnsNang,350639,356000,so you want to shift your language and  start thinking more positively and if  you feel like you aren't deserving of a
Zv_slnsNang,356000,361199,loving relationship a loving partner  you're most likely going to attract the
Zv_slnsNang,361199,367039,wrong type of people in your life and if  you're focusing on how much money you  don't have in your life right now or how
Zv_slnsNang,367039,374000,your business could fail you're not  going to be able to focus your energy on  the right clients or the products that
Zv_slnsNang,374000,379919,will take your business to the next  level or the skills you need to develop  to help you grow now your thoughts
Zv_slnsNang,379919,385280,dictate your actions and where your  energy goes so you want to be thinking  about
Zv_slnsNang,385280,391759,what can i do to replace these negative  thoughts the anxiousness of the fear how  can i replace it so my energy can go any
Zv_slnsNang,391759,396960,more positive direction and again where  you put your energy into is what you
Zv_slnsNang,396960,402400,attract  so if you're thinking energy thoughts  all day long you're probably gonna  attract that if you're thinking
Zv_slnsNang,402400,408960,gratitude and positive thoughts you'll  start to see that show up differently so  how can we put the law of attraction
Zv_slnsNang,408960,414000,into practice now let's go back to our  examples and apply a new way of thinking
Zv_slnsNang,414000,420000,if you're caught and thinking negatively  about the world and about yourself this  is so important
Zv_slnsNang,420000,425280,what would change inside of you if you  looked around  and you wrote down five things that
Zv_slnsNang,425280,431360,you're grateful for about the world now  this for me  is part of the secret to the law of
Zv_slnsNang,431360,436880,attraction it's the foundation is  gratitude it's your way of being must be
Zv_slnsNang,436880,443520,grateful in order to attract new things  there's so many things in my life that i  should not have attracted
Zv_slnsNang,443520,448720,because i didn't have the skills because  i didn't have the tools because i didn't  have the education because i didn't have
Zv_slnsNang,448720,454960,the money because i didn't have the  resources  so many things that i shouldn't have  attracted but because i had the
Zv_slnsNang,454960,460880,foundation of gratitude  passion joy curiosity those things
Zv_slnsNang,460880,467360,started to come to me and they can come  to you as well if you come from that  place of gratitude as your foundation
Zv_slnsNang,467360,472879,so you want to think about what are  these things that are important to me in  my life you know it can be simple things
Zv_slnsNang,472879,477919,it could be like this cup of coffee that  i have right now it can be that i have a  roof over my head that i've got quality
Zv_slnsNang,477919,482960,friends that i'm healthy  you know that i'm walking in nature  today it doesn't have to be
Zv_slnsNang,482960,490879,some grandiose thing that's happened to  you to be grateful for i'm so grateful  for these little present moments
Zv_slnsNang,490879,496000,with people that i care about to spend  an hour on the beach to go for a walk
Zv_slnsNang,496000,501280,with a friend to have a good  conversation with someone and talk about  something i'm going through for me
Zv_slnsNang,501280,507759,that's just as meaningful  the moments in between the big moments  are just as meaningful so write down
Zv_slnsNang,507759,513518,these things or think about these things  this is something i embed in my daily  life when i wake up i think about what
Zv_slnsNang,513518,519518,i'm grateful for when i go to sleep i i  think about and reflect on the things  i'm grateful for from that day and it's
Zv_slnsNang,519518,526160,just my way of being for as much as i  can now i'm not perfect i make mistakes  and there's some times i'm negative
Zv_slnsNang,526160,532160,but it's something that i try to really  focus on as much as possible so instead  of saying that you're not enough
Zv_slnsNang,532160,538640,that you don't deserve success what if  you looked in the mirror on a daily  basis i dare you to look in the mirror
Zv_slnsNang,538640,544399,on a daily basis and say i am enough and  i do deserve  the results that i want to create in my
Zv_slnsNang,544399,549440,life because i show up because i'm  consistent because i work hard because i
Zv_slnsNang,549440,555760,care about my work  if you looked in the mirror and you did  this consistently for 30 days and you  actually
Zv_slnsNang,555760,562800,use the word action in attraction and  you put it into practice on a daily  basis towards that growth
Zv_slnsNang,562800,569440,i'd be amazed to see what you attract  and what you manifest in your life or if  you felt like you weren't deserving of a
Zv_slnsNang,569440,574560,loving partner and just kept focusing on  the wrong people what if you said you
Zv_slnsNang,574560,581200,know what i am deserving of a loving  partner because i care deeply about  those around me and i am worthy of
Zv_slnsNang,581200,587760,feeling deeply cared about myself  and what if you started to change your  thoughts and behaviors around yourself
Zv_slnsNang,587760,595920,say i'm not going to keep doing the  things that i've always done i'm going  to start showing up differently and love  myself not needing someone else to love
Zv_slnsNang,595920,602079,me who maybe isn't in the right mindset  and start distancing yourself from those  typical patterns that you've had in the
Zv_slnsNang,602079,608800,past and love yourself first and see  what you attract from that loving  grateful place with yourself or if you
Zv_slnsNang,608800,614640,are in a tough financial spot maybe  you're struggling financially you've  been trying to start a business or a  side hustle
Zv_slnsNang,614640,619839,i've been there i know what this feels  like it's not fun for a long time i was  living on my sister's couch i didn't
Zv_slnsNang,619839,626079,have much money it was really stressful  i remember this feeling of being stuck  feeling like i was never going to make
Zv_slnsNang,626079,633680,any money and when i was focusing on  that feeling of i'm never going to make  this money i feel stuck i feel trapped
Zv_slnsNang,633680,640800,when's this gonna happen feeling this  anxiousness this stress around it  it was really impossible for me to think
Zv_slnsNang,640800,646079,of creative ideas it was impossible for  me to  take action because i was living in the
Zv_slnsNang,646079,651680,stress as opposed to the gratitude for  what i was having in that moment i  should have been focusing on you know
Zv_slnsNang,651680,658800,what my sister is allowing me to stay  here for free so i have some time to  learn a new skill  i made a hundred dollars this day i
Zv_slnsNang,658800,664959,should be grateful for that not focusing  on what i'm lacking or what i don't have  but what i am creating on a daily basis
Zv_slnsNang,664959,670720,and i started to ask different questions  around this time like how can i be of  service to other people how can i add as
Zv_slnsNang,670720,675839,much value to someone else or what are  my top skill sets that i can use
Zv_slnsNang,675839,681279,to my advantage that no one else has  like what do i have i started writing a  list of all these different skills that
Zv_slnsNang,681279,687600,i had even when i didn't think i had  many skills i still wrote down a list of  the qualities i have of the skills from
Zv_slnsNang,687600,694880,the past that maybe i could apply to  right now and when i began asking those  types of questions i started attracting
Zv_slnsNang,694880,701680,the people who needed my skill sets and  services and i finally started to make  more money than ever before because i
Zv_slnsNang,701680,708640,was thinking about serving others i was  thinking from a positive grateful  standpoint about helping others and
Zv_slnsNang,708640,714880,starting a side hustle which turned into  a business instead of thinking  negatively about not having any money or
Zv_slnsNang,714880,720720,i'm sleeping on my sister's couch and  why is it taking me so long to create  this and i'll never make anything from
Zv_slnsNang,720720,726639,this situation i started focusing on how  can i add value as much value as  possible to this one person in front of
Zv_slnsNang,726639,732560,me right now how can i serve them how  can i create for them how can i connect  someone to them that could help them
Zv_slnsNang,732560,739040,what can i do to add value and help  someone else achieve their goals because  i think as zig ziglar said if you want
Zv_slnsNang,739040,744480,to accomplish all of your goals help  other people accomplish their goals and  that's what i started focusing on
Zv_slnsNang,744480,751920,not what i'm lacking but how can i give  and how can i add value to other people  when you focus outward on service you
Zv_slnsNang,751920,758720,start to really attract some incredible  things in your life it's unbelievable  the ripple effect the domino effect
Zv_slnsNang,758720,764000,one person helping another person how it  comes back around to you
Zv_slnsNang,764000,770720,if the sun is energy and you sit outside  and uh you know you're enjoying the sun
Zv_slnsNang,770720,778079,and it's nice and warm  if you sit long enough  the concentration of energy on your face
Zv_slnsNang,778079,783120,may cause a little bit of a tan right  so it's going to cause your skin to get
Zv_slnsNang,783120,788720,tanned agreed so the energy is having an  effect the energy that's 93 million
Zv_slnsNang,788720,794720,miles away that's taking 8.8 minutes to  reach my face from the sun
Zv_slnsNang,794720,801760,can affect my skin right now what if  what if i took that sun and in between
Zv_slnsNang,801760,807200,the sun  and my face okay  if i took that light and focused it
Zv_slnsNang,807200,813040,through the lens concentrated it to my  face could i burn a hole in my skin or
Zv_slnsNang,813040,818880,if i took one of my goal cards right  it's my gold cards  right if i took the sun
Zv_slnsNang,818880,825360,right and i  used it to  magnify to increase the amplitude of the
Zv_slnsNang,825360,833440,vibration  of the energy called the sun through the  magnifying glass you know onto the paper
Zv_slnsNang,833440,838480,right could i burn a hole in the paper  by focusing that energy
Zv_slnsNang,838480,844480,general sun right is general heat but  with a little bit of focus and  concentration
Zv_slnsNang,844480,849680,right i can increase the amplitude of  the vibration of the sun now stay with  me
Zv_slnsNang,849680,855519,watch this what if i took the same sun  and instead of just focusing the sun
Zv_slnsNang,855519,862800,a little bit okay  a little bit you know between the sun  and the paper what if i reduce the
Zv_slnsNang,862800,872000,energy or increase the amplitude of  vibration so i can actually get a laser  single photon same sun but focused even
Zv_slnsNang,872000,878720,more highly okay could i use the energy  of the sun to create a laser to burn
Zv_slnsNang,878720,884240,through a piece of steel  yes or yes it's not a no yes or no
Zv_slnsNang,884240,890560,question it's a yes or yes answer okay  why is this important
Zv_slnsNang,890560,896720,okay it's important because  the more you learn to concentrate
Zv_slnsNang,896720,902399,okay the more you learn to concentrate  your brain the electromagnetic switching
Zv_slnsNang,902399,908880,station that can be fragmented or  focused  on your vision health goals wealth goals
Zv_slnsNang,908880,915760,relationship goals career goals the more  you can stop being distracted the more  you can concentrate
Zv_slnsNang,915760,922079,okay the most powerful electromagnetic  switching station  called your brain
Zv_slnsNang,922079,927680,right you activate that left prefrontal  cortex you activate the emotional parts  of your brain you activate the
Zv_slnsNang,927680,932800,instinctual parts of your brain the more  you learn how to focus on your precise
Zv_slnsNang,932800,937920,vision and goals and how you're going to  achieve it and then you take
Zv_slnsNang,937920,943759,inspired action  daily  the more you are concentrating this
Zv_slnsNang,943759,949120,molecular structure called the human  being to move towards the goal but the  more you are in resonance with exactly
Zv_slnsNang,949120,954720,what you want to achieve so is it  possible  that by learning how to do that
Zv_slnsNang,954720,960959,you can achieve your goals faster and  easier than ever before and the answer  is absolutely but you know what  everybody thinks oh i'm just going to
Zv_slnsNang,960959,966000,like hope and pray and my goals are  going to become a reality that is just  
Zv_slnsNang,966000,971279,so stop fooling yourself okay  i hope you don't mind a little bit of
Zv_slnsNang,971279,976959,animation so  in the world that we live in this is one  of the other great laws the law
Zv_slnsNang,976959,983440,of cause and effect  okay  the law of cause and effect for every
Zv_slnsNang,983440,991120,effect there's a cause for every cause  there's an effect  so  if you are thinking positively but
Zv_slnsNang,991120,998399,feeling negatively  that is a self-fulfilling doom loop  cause effect cause effect you have to do
Zv_slnsNang,998399,1005360,okay i'm gonna type in something right  now  s-e-m-p  all right s-e-m-p i just typed the word
Zv_slnsNang,1005360,1012639,for you acid you've gotta get the  spiritual energy  the emotional energy the mental energy
Zv_slnsNang,1012639,1019600,and the physical  energy in alignment  if any one of those four things is out
Zv_slnsNang,1019600,1026720,of alignment  that would be like having your  dial on the radio station for classical
Zv_slnsNang,1026720,1033520,music or jazz or rock and roll or love  songs just a little bit off the station
Zv_slnsNang,1033520,1039038,our universe operates  by law and precision at the physical
Zv_slnsNang,1039038,1044240,level physical laws at the quantum level  quantum laws and yes there's randomness
Zv_slnsNang,1044240,1050720,in the quantum field but it operates at  lightning speeds perfectly every time no
Zv_slnsNang,1050720,1056240,exceptions  newtonian world is all about the  predictable it's all about predicting
Zv_slnsNang,1056240,1061360,the future but the quantum model of  reality is is about causing an effect
Zv_slnsNang,1061360,1066880,the moment you start feeling abundant  and worthy you are generating wealth the
Zv_slnsNang,1066880,1072880,moment you're empowered and feel it  you're beginning to step towards your  success the moment you start feeling
Zv_slnsNang,1072880,1079440,whole  your healing begins and when you love  yourself and you love all of life you'll  create an equal and now you're causing
Zv_slnsNang,1079440,1085360,an effect  and i think that's the the difference  between living as a victim in your world
Zv_slnsNang,1085360,1091840,saying i am this way because of this  person or that thing or this experience  they made me think and feel this way
Zv_slnsNang,1091840,1097919,when you switch that around you become a  creator of your world and you start  saying my thinking and my feeling is
Zv_slnsNang,1097919,1103280,changing an outcome in my life and now  that's a whole different game and we  start believing more that we're creators
Zv_slnsNang,1103280,1109039,of reality how do we then go from that  like mechanistically
Zv_slnsNang,1109039,1115440,to begin this visualization process of  something that's empowering it's me in a  different state it's my future self is
Zv_slnsNang,1115440,1123440,it meditation is it  what does that look like if you're not  being defi by a vision of the future
Zv_slnsNang,1123440,1128720,then you're left with the old memories  of the past and you will be predictable  in your life
Zv_slnsNang,1128720,1134400,and if you wake up in the morning and  you're not being defined by a vision in  the future as you see the same people
Zv_slnsNang,1134400,1139679,and you go to the same places and you do  the exact same thing at the exact same  time
Zv_slnsNang,1139679,1145600,it's no longer that your personality is  creating your personal reality now your  personal reality is affecting or
Zv_slnsNang,1145600,1151679,creating your personality your  environment is really controlling how  you think and feel unconsciously because
Zv_slnsNang,1151679,1157200,every person everything every place  every experience has a neurological  network in your brain
Zv_slnsNang,1157200,1163280,every experience that you have with  every person produces an emotion so some  people will use their boss to reaffirm
Zv_slnsNang,1163280,1168720,their addiction to judgment they'll use  their enemy to reaffirm their addiction  to hatred they'll use their friends to
Zv_slnsNang,1168720,1174559,reaffirm their addiction to suffering so  now they need the outer world to feel  something
Zv_slnsNang,1174559,1180320,so  to change then  is to be greater than your environment  to be greater than the conditions in
Zv_slnsNang,1180320,1186799,your world and the environment is that  seductive  so then  why is meditation the tool well
Zv_slnsNang,1186799,1192559,let's sit down let's close our eyes  let's disconnect  from your outer environment so if you're
Zv_slnsNang,1192559,1198080,seeing less things there's less  stimulation going to your brain if  you're playing soft music or you have
Zv_slnsNang,1198080,1203679,ear plugs in less sensory information  coming to your brain so you're  disconnecting from your environment if
Zv_slnsNang,1203679,1209679,you can sit your body down and tell it  to stay like an animal stay right here
Zv_slnsNang,1209679,1215200,i'm gonna feed you when we're done you  can get up and check your emails you can  do all your texts but right now you're
Zv_slnsNang,1215200,1220480,gonna sit there and obey me  so then  when you do that properly and you're not
Zv_slnsNang,1220480,1225919,eating anything or smelling anything or  tasting anything you're not up  experiencing and feeling anything
Zv_slnsNang,1225919,1232720,you would have to agree with me that  you're being defined by a thought right  so when the body wants to go back to its
Zv_slnsNang,1232720,1238080,emotional past  and you become aware that your attention  is on that emotion and where you place
Zv_slnsNang,1238080,1244080,your attention is where you place your  energy you're siphoning your energy out  of the present moment into the past and
Zv_slnsNang,1244080,1249120,you become aware of that  and you settle your body back down in  the present moment because it's saying
Zv_slnsNang,1249120,1254559,well it's 8 o'clock you normally get  upset because you're in traffic around  this time and here you are sitting and
Zv_slnsNang,1254559,1260720,we're used to feeling anger and you're  off schedule oh it's 11 o'clock and  usually check your emails and judge
Zv_slnsNang,1260720,1268080,everybody well the body's looking for  that that predictable chemical state  every time you become aware that you're
Zv_slnsNang,1268080,1273919,doing that and your body is craving  those emotions and you settle it back  down into the present moment you're
Zv_slnsNang,1273919,1279679,telling the body  it's no longer the mind that you're the  mind and now your will
Zv_slnsNang,1279679,1286880,is getting greater than the program and  if you keep doing this over and over  again over and over again over and over  again just like training a stallion
Zv_slnsNang,1286880,1291919,or a dog it's just gonna say  i'm going to sit and the moment that
Zv_slnsNang,1291919,1298559,happens the body is no longer the mind  when it finally surrenders  there's a liberation of energy
Zv_slnsNang,1298559,1305919,we go from particle to wave from matter  to energy and we free ourselves from the  chains of those emotions that keep us in
Zv_slnsNang,1305919,1314000,the in the familiar past and we've seen  this  thousands of times in fact we can  actually predict it now on a brain scan
Zv_slnsNang,1314000,1320960,when we stop expecting things to be the  way that we  think they should be when we stop
Zv_slnsNang,1320960,1326559,forcing outcomes and when we start  allowing what is of the highest good to
Zv_slnsNang,1326559,1333600,be our only agenda our only intention  that's when the universe truly has our
Zv_slnsNang,1333600,1340960,back that's when we can  live what it means to surrender true  surrender comes when we stop
Zv_slnsNang,1340960,1347440,praying for what we think we need and we  start  connecting and grounding in what could
Zv_slnsNang,1347440,1353600,possibly be of the highest  good for all  when we stop praying for what we think
Zv_slnsNang,1353600,1360159,we need and we start allowing what is of  the highest good for all so true  manifesting is about receiving what is
Zv_slnsNang,1360159,1366400,of the highest good for all and it  begins not just with what well how will  i get what is of the highest good but
Zv_slnsNang,1366400,1373280,how can i be open to what is of the  highest good how can i open up my  consciousness to release what i think i
Zv_slnsNang,1373280,1379200,need and get grounded in what is  possible  and what is of the highest good not just
Zv_slnsNang,1379200,1384720,for me and my agenda but the highest  good for all that's the message so
Zv_slnsNang,1384720,1391679,you're doing everything right in that  you're  open to a spiritual practice you're  willing to grow you're showing up for
Zv_slnsNang,1391679,1397039,your practice you're reading books  you're doing the work you're here on  dear gabby you're showing up you're  showing up you're showing up you're
Zv_slnsNang,1397039,1403840,doing a lot of doing though and you're  also doing a lot of expecting and so a  lot of doing and a lot of expecting are
Zv_slnsNang,1403840,1410240,two major blocks to your ability to  attract what it is that you want into  your life and so it's the doing doing
Zv_slnsNang,1410240,1416320,doing that actually creates sort of a  manic manifesting vibration which is how  do i get that how do what am i what do i
Zv_slnsNang,1416320,1421919,do next got to do this thing next got to  do this thing next and that lacks the  belief system that i can be still and i
Zv_slnsNang,1421919,1429039,can allow  that's number one  number two being in the expectation of  what you think things should be is
Zv_slnsNang,1429039,1435919,another block to your manifesting power  and your super attractor power which is  what i call it because your expectations
Zv_slnsNang,1435919,1440960,are limiting the possibilities your  expectations are limiting the highest
Zv_slnsNang,1440960,1446640,good as this card says so when we start  to pray for what is of the highest good
Zv_slnsNang,1446640,1451840,rather than intend and pray for what we  think we need that's when the universe
Zv_slnsNang,1451840,1457360,can conspire with what it is that is of  the highest good for all  so ultimately what's happening is all
Zv_slnsNang,1457360,1462559,the doing doing doing is energetically  blocking  and all the expecting expecting
Zv_slnsNang,1462559,1469360,expecting is blocking the manifestation  as well because when you're in this  tunnel vision of expectation it should
Zv_slnsNang,1469360,1474720,be this way i should be further along i  shouldn't be here what's happening is  you're missing the opportunity to
Zv_slnsNang,1474720,1481679,recognize where you are how great things  are in this moment what is possible in  this moment the creative possibility in
Zv_slnsNang,1481679,1487600,this moment the exciting potential in  this moment you're blocking it blocking  it blocking it blocking it blocking it
Zv_slnsNang,1487600,1495679,blocking it  i want you to sit on your ass  i want you to stop doing doing doing
Zv_slnsNang,1495679,1501120,i want you to  start being being being which is what
Zv_slnsNang,1501120,1507360,you also said you're actually dear  gabbying yourself  you said i want to embody the feeling i
Zv_slnsNang,1507360,1513520,want to embody the emotion  the being  is a presence it's an energy it's a
Zv_slnsNang,1513520,1519440,state  it's not an action  true manifesting does require
Zv_slnsNang,1519440,1524960,us to show up for our desires you've got  to pick up the phone and then call the  job interview and you have to ask for
Zv_slnsNang,1524960,1530000,the date and you have to to do whatever  it is that you want to create but  ultimately
Zv_slnsNang,1530000,1535679,the greatest source of power that we  have to attract what we want is how we
Zv_slnsNang,1535679,1542400,feel  there is a reason many of the great  women and men of the world the great  history makers the great poets the great
Zv_slnsNang,1542400,1550559,philosophers the great  movement makers rose before the sun  there is a magic in the air at 5am and
Zv_slnsNang,1550559,1557120,that's why the 5m club is so  transformational because it's the time  of greatest quietude and i believe
Zv_slnsNang,1557120,1564080,tranquility is the new luxury on our  planet it is the time of intimate  creativity because you've just been
Zv_slnsNang,1564080,1569120,arrested your brain is fresh there's  there's latest  there's there's very recent cutting-edge
Zv_slnsNang,1569120,1574799,science coming out now when you sleep  your brain actually has a mechanism to  wash itself when you wake up in the
Zv_slnsNang,1574799,1580559,morning your willpower is strongest when  you wake up in the morning you've got a  full well of mental focus and we know
Zv_slnsNang,1580559,1586960,that focus in our world is even more  valuable than intelligence and i could  go on and on on the benefits i mean you
Zv_slnsNang,1586960,1592080,get up at 5am you've got the world to  yourself there's no crowds you can think
Zv_slnsNang,1592080,1597200,you can plan you can care for yourself  in a world where so many people are so
Zv_slnsNang,1597200,1602720,depleted and so the five it the 5 a.m  club really is a game changer and then
Zv_slnsNang,1602720,1608799,it's not just get up at 5am and you know  scratch your stomach or stare up at the  ceiling or look at your phone or look at
Zv_slnsNang,1608799,1615600,especially i believe you can play with  your phone or change the world you don't  get to do both yeah and so uh it the 5am
Zv_slnsNang,1615600,1621080,club method is based on the 20 20 20  formula i'm happy to get into it but  that is tell us what it is that's the
Zv_slnsNang,1621080,1627200,revolutionizer and and it started from  my experience with working with many  billionaires i i've coached many of the
Zv_slnsNang,1627200,1632720,most successful financiers and  titans of industry for for over two  decades
Zv_slnsNang,1632720,1639039,and one of the things i would run them  through is the way you begin your day  sets up the way you live your day and so
Zv_slnsNang,1639039,1645600,the 20 20 20 formula that the book is  based upon is pretty simple i i go into  great detail in the book but
Zv_slnsNang,1645600,1653919,essentially it's from 5 to 5 20 the  first pocket is move  and i'm a fanatic about neuroscience and
Zv_slnsNang,1653919,1659039,why do you get up and move because  you're going to release serotonin which  is going to make you feel better you're
Zv_slnsNang,1659039,1664159,going to release dopamine which is the  pleasure and inspirational  neurotransmitter you're going to release
Zv_slnsNang,1664159,1671440,norepinephrine which will boost your  focus you'll promote neurogenesis marie  you can actually grow new brain cells
Zv_slnsNang,1671440,1677120,you'll increase your metabolic rate so  the way you beg the way you feel when  you first wake up is not the way you're
Zv_slnsNang,1677120,1682399,going to feel at 5 20. second pocket of  the 20 20 20 formula 20 minutes from 5
Zv_slnsNang,1682399,1689039,20 to 5 40 that's on reflection so a lot  of us are busy but what's the point of  being busy if you're doing the wrong
Zv_slnsNang,1689039,1695279,things  the the billionaires the great creatives  the people of great impact the people  who live beautiful lives are very
Zv_slnsNang,1695279,1700399,intentional  they're very deliberate they're very  conscious so for 20 minutes you write in
Zv_slnsNang,1700399,1708159,a journal  you can visualize you can pray you can  meditate you can simply
Zv_slnsNang,1708159,1715120,contemplate  how you're going to live your day what  you want to stand for during the day for  example and then the final pocket of the
Zv_slnsNang,1715120,1721760,20 20 20 formula is all about grow and  that's where you you just read from a  biography or a business book or a
Zv_slnsNang,1721760,1728240,philosophy book or a  and so that's 20 minutes of growing  because i think we're most alive when we
Zv_slnsNang,1728240,1734559,are growing yes and  i believe the leader who learns the most  wins
Zv_slnsNang,1734559,1740080,many of us have issues with productivity  maybe we are overly productive but we're
Zv_slnsNang,1740080,1746240,feeling burnt out all the time or we're  not productive at all because we don't  know where to start  i found personally being in business for
Zv_slnsNang,1746240,1752320,myself for the last 20 years that i have  been a little overly productive i almost
Zv_slnsNang,1752320,1759440,did too much and i was constantly  multitasking and making things happen  and just moving so fast that ultimately
Zv_slnsNang,1759440,1764799,i really burnt out and i started feeling  brain fog i was feeling disoriented i
Zv_slnsNang,1764799,1770240,couldn't focus i was feeling like even  though i for so many years was priding  myself on the fact that i could get so
Zv_slnsNang,1770240,1776000,much done at one time i actually don't  think i was being nearly as productive  as i could have been so i hit a bottom
Zv_slnsNang,1776000,1781520,recently with this productivity overload  and i realized that i had to change my
Zv_slnsNang,1781520,1787279,patterns i had to change my ways i was  then blessed i said a prayer i said i  need some help with my brain fog and i
Zv_slnsNang,1787279,1792320,need some help with my productivity  issue and i that day got an email from
Zv_slnsNang,1792320,1799919,the dr oz show asking me to come on and  do a segment with this lovely author and  dr dr mike dao and me and mike had been
Zv_slnsNang,1799919,1806000,in touch many years  for many years just because he hadn't  been an author we were published by the  same publishers and mike had written a
Zv_slnsNang,1806000,1812799,book about brain fog so that day i'm  like thank you universe you're giving me  exactly what i need i go on dr oz with
Zv_slnsNang,1812799,1818960,mike and i'm backstage with him and i'm  like listen i'm feeling so chaotic and  i'm multitasking so much and my i feel
Zv_slnsNang,1818960,1825600,like i've got brain fog and i'm  forgetting things and he looked at me  says how much are you doing at one time  and i said oh mike i'm doing a million
Zv_slnsNang,1825600,1831840,things at once i have a thousand tabs up  on my screen and he's like these are big  brain no-no's and they're also
Zv_slnsNang,1831840,1837360,productivity no-no's is what he said  because he said that the more i try to  do and the more i try to multitask the
Zv_slnsNang,1837360,1843039,less i'm actually getting done so he  gave me a tip that i want to share with  you that has changed everything for me
Zv_slnsNang,1843039,1848720,and his suggestion was to just do five  things a day  to make a list of the five most
Zv_slnsNang,1848720,1854960,important things that i need to do that  day and not do number two until i've  completed number one and then once i
Zv_slnsNang,1854960,1860240,complete number one move on to number  two then on to number three and if i  don't get through all five in one day
Zv_slnsNang,1860240,1867840,i'll just pick up the fifth the next day  or wherever i left off i'll pick up the  next day  and to really stick to that list and not
Zv_slnsNang,1867840,1873039,move back and forth and not try to make  a million other things added on to that  list and just be really committed to
Zv_slnsNang,1873039,1878399,that five task list  i did it i started to just be very clear
Zv_slnsNang,1878399,1883760,about the five things i was doing in a  day i told my team i made a a list in my
Zv_slnsNang,1883760,1888960,base camp which is where we keep all of  our notes and i made it really clear to  myself these are the only five things
Zv_slnsNang,1888960,1894159,i'm doing throughout the day  as a result of making it super clear and
Zv_slnsNang,1894159,1900080,conscious to myself that i was only  going to do five things i have been more  productive i have created more i have
Zv_slnsNang,1900080,1905679,been more intuitive i have been more  inspired and i've been more creative
Zv_slnsNang,1905679,1911760,i've been  really working on getting honest and  telling the truth and being forthcoming
Zv_slnsNang,1911760,1918559,about how i'm feeling  i know this is something that can be  very squirrely for people we can get  really hung up about actually saying how
Zv_slnsNang,1918559,1923760,you feel and telling the truth but when  we don't tell the truth we actually
Zv_slnsNang,1923760,1929360,stifle our energy we create toxic  relationships we carry resentments and
Zv_slnsNang,1929360,1934559,it builds up and builds up and builds up  so i've gotten to the practice of this  just radically telling the truth
Zv_slnsNang,1934559,1940480,wherever i am however i need to be  authentic and truthful about what i'm  feeling but i have a few steps that i
Zv_slnsNang,1940480,1946480,think are important that you need to  take in before you actually  give that truth over because if you
Zv_slnsNang,1946480,1952080,share your truth without cleaning up  your side of the street it'll feel like  an attack it'll feel like judgment so
Zv_slnsNang,1952080,1959440,the process of telling the truth is  quite simple  first take a look at your side of the  street look at what's up for you if you
Zv_slnsNang,1959440,1965600,feel called to get honest with somebody  what is it within you that's feeling  triggered what is it that's that's
Zv_slnsNang,1965600,1971919,feeling activated and do whatever you  need to do to clear that whether it be  forgiving yourself for giving the other
Zv_slnsNang,1971919,1978720,person saying prayers for that other  person sending loving energy to that  other person and clean up the energy
Zv_slnsNang,1978720,1984960,before you bring over the truth because  you don't want to show up with this  nasty attitude because your truth won't
Zv_slnsNang,1984960,1991679,be heard you need to bring your truth  with a lot of light so that they can see  their light reflected back to them
Zv_slnsNang,1991679,1997039,so the process is really simple look at  your side of the street before you show  up and tell the truth and then be
Zv_slnsNang,1997039,2004080,prepared to get honest from a place of  love if you can tell the truth from a  place of love then you will be heard and
Zv_slnsNang,2004080,2009600,that's when you feel healed and that's  when a healing can be offered up to the  relationship but as long as you're
Zv_slnsNang,2009600,2016880,telling the truth from a place of  negativity or judgment it will not be  heard and it won't work i learned this  the hard way unfortunately but the
Zv_slnsNang,2016880,2022480,experience has given me this great  opportunity to learn how to tell the  truth with grace and power
Zv_slnsNang,2022480,2029039,the benefit of telling the truth is that  you start to feel like you're taking  care of yourself you start to feel like  you're owning your voice you're owning
Zv_slnsNang,2029039,2034559,your needs you're protecting yourself  when you need to protect yourself and  you're sticking up for what your values
Zv_slnsNang,2034559,2040880,are no matter what and you're also just  really getting clear about what your  boundaries may be within certain
Zv_slnsNang,2040880,2047440,relationships and so sometimes people  may not like your truth but you could  always trust that if you're sharing your
Zv_slnsNang,2047440,2052480,truth from a place of love you will be  heard even if they get defensive even if
Zv_slnsNang,2052480,2059760,they get upset that your loving presence  is enough to allow that truth to come  through in a very authentic way
Zv_slnsNang,2059760,2065280,the other part that may be very helpful  is once you've told your truth give the  person their opportunity to tell their
Zv_slnsNang,2065280,2072560,own hold that space for them to say how  they feel there's always two sides to  every story so speak up and then allow
Zv_slnsNang,2072560,2078320,the other person to speak up clearing  that space for the truth to unfold and  trusting that the truth will totally set
Zv_slnsNang,2078320,2084158,you free my mom has always said this to  me for my entire life the truth will set  you free the truth will set you free and
Zv_slnsNang,2084158,2089679,i believe that we all want freedom we  want freedom from resentment freedom  from anxiety freedom from fear and that
Zv_slnsNang,2089679,2097040,freedom is available as we start to open  up to the truth within us  i once heard a definition of health that
Zv_slnsNang,2097040,2103839,made a lot of sense to me  good health it said  is having no fatigue
Zv_slnsNang,2103839,2109280,having a good appetite  going to sleep and awakening easily
Zv_slnsNang,2109280,2115920,having a good memory  having good humor  and having precision in thought and
Zv_slnsNang,2115920,2120960,action  not being clutzy  being honest
Zv_slnsNang,2120960,2127440,humble  grateful and loving  how healthy are you
Zv_slnsNang,2127440,2132560,i do not heal anyone  the work i do is to help people
Zv_slnsNang,2132560,2138480,understand how their own mental patterns  are constantly creating their own life
Zv_slnsNang,2138480,2145200,experiences  all of them  the good  experiences and the so-called bad
Zv_slnsNang,2145200,2151599,experiences  and also  how these same mental patterns
Zv_slnsNang,2151599,2160640,are contributing to the ease  and dis-ease  in their bodies we do not want to be ill
Zv_slnsNang,2160640,2167440,and yet we need every disease we have  it is the body's way of telling us that
Zv_slnsNang,2167440,2173119,we have a false idea in consciousness  our body is telling us
Zv_slnsNang,2173119,2179119,we are on the wrong track  and need to change the way we think
Zv_slnsNang,2179119,2184320,every illness  is a lesson  for us to learn
Zv_slnsNang,2184320,2189440,please do not just complain i want to  get rid of this condition
Zv_slnsNang,2189440,2195520,it will not create the healing you want  nor will you learn the lesson you need
Zv_slnsNang,2195520,2202960,to learn  this is not a time for condemnation  or for creating more guilt
Zv_slnsNang,2202960,2208160,we are just looking at what needs to be  released
Zv_slnsNang,2208160,2213440,this is a time for healing  for making our lives and our bodies
Zv_slnsNang,2213440,2219599,whole  i know  you have within you all that you need to
Zv_slnsNang,2219599,2226240,accomplish this  once we begin to understand this process
Zv_slnsNang,2226240,2231839,we are able to take conscious control  of the changes we wish to make in our
Zv_slnsNang,2231839,2238800,life  this is a very exciting process  and becomes one of the most important
Zv_slnsNang,2238800,2244800,adventures in our life  i believe there is a center of wisdom
Zv_slnsNang,2244800,2249839,within each one of us  and when we are ready to make positive
Zv_slnsNang,2249839,2256640,changes in our lives  we attract whatever we need to help us
Zv_slnsNang,2256640,2262640,something inside of you has shifted  and the healing process has already
Zv_slnsNang,2262640,2268000,begun  you might even say that to yourself now
Zv_slnsNang,2268000,2273520,i have already begun  the healing process
Zv_slnsNang,2273520,2279280,the body like everything else in life  is a mirror of our inner thoughts and
Zv_slnsNang,2279280,2287200,beliefs  the body is always talking to us if we  will only take the time to listen
Zv_slnsNang,2287200,2292400,every cell  responds to every single thought you  think
Zv_slnsNang,2292400,2300800,and every word you speak  continuous modes of thinking and  speaking produce body behaviors and
Zv_slnsNang,2300800,2305920,postures and eases or diseases
Zv_slnsNang,2305920,2313040,the person who has a permanently  scowling face  did not produce that by having joyous
Zv_slnsNang,2313040,2318160,loving thoughts  older people's faces and bodies
Zv_slnsNang,2318160,2323440,show so clearly a lifetime of inner  dialogue
Zv_slnsNang,2323440,2330960,how will you look when you are elderly  you see it is my belief that it is our
Zv_slnsNang,2330960,2336240,birth right to be totally healthy  and totally fulfilled
Zv_slnsNang,2336240,2341440,in every area of our lives take a nice  deep breath
Zv_slnsNang,2341440,2346880,and if possible  allow yourself to be in a comfortable  position
Zv_slnsNang,2346880,2354640,just let these ideas wash over you  only those ideas that are right for you
Zv_slnsNang,2354640,2359760,will be accepted by you  it doesn't matter whether you understand
Zv_slnsNang,2359760,2365200,them all or not  or if they make sense to you right now
Zv_slnsNang,2365200,2371359,your subconscious mind will hear and  record whatever you need
Zv_slnsNang,2371359,2377280,i believe that all illness is  self-created  not that we say i want to have this
Zv_slnsNang,2377280,2385920,illness  but we create a mental atmosphere where  this dis-ease can grow and flourish
Zv_slnsNang,2385920,2391520,our internal mental dialogue  reacts in every cell
Zv_slnsNang,2391520,2396800,in the body  i heard a physician say recently if the
Zv_slnsNang,2396800,2402160,surgeon operates on a patient without  doing something to help them change the
Zv_slnsNang,2402160,2409520,cause of the disease  then all the doctor is doing is  prolonging the life of the patient
Zv_slnsNang,2409520,2414560,until the patient can create another  dis-ease
Zv_slnsNang,2414560,2421599,you see we need to do more than just  treat the symptom  we need to eliminate the cause of the
Zv_slnsNang,2421599,2428880,dis-ease  and for that we need to go within  ourselves where the process of illness
Zv_slnsNang,2428880,2436079,began  it is my belief that we are each  responsible for every experience in our
Zv_slnsNang,2436079,2442640,lives  the best and the worst  we all create our experiences by the
Zv_slnsNang,2442640,2448880,thoughts we think and the words we speak  the universe totally supports our
Zv_slnsNang,2448880,2454800,internal dialogue  our subconscious mind accepts as truth
Zv_slnsNang,2454800,2462319,whatever we choose to believe  you can say it either way  they both mean that what i believe about
Zv_slnsNang,2462319,2467359,myself and about life becomes true for  me
Zv_slnsNang,2467359,2474960,what you choose to think about yourself  and about life becomes true for you
Zv_slnsNang,2474960,2491400,[Music]
Zv_slnsNang,2491760,2493839,you
