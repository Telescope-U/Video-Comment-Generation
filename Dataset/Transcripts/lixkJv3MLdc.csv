lixkJv3MLdc,1835,3403,"Harry: From calorie count to portion sizes,"
lixkJv3MLdc,3403,4738,we wanted to find out all the differences
lixkJv3MLdc,4738,7173,between Coca-Cola in the UK and the US.
lixkJv3MLdc,7173,8641,"This is ""Food Wars."""
lixkJv3MLdc,13513,15981,"In the UK, regular Coke comes in eight portion sizes,"
lixkJv3MLdc,15982,18785,"starting with this mini can, which is 150 milliliters."
lixkJv3MLdc,18785,20553,Then we have three options which all include
lixkJv3MLdc,20553,22421,250 milliliters of Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,22422,24991,"Then we have our standard can, which is 330 milliliters."
lixkJv3MLdc,25258,27894,Our standard plastic bottle is 500 milliliters.
lixkJv3MLdc,27894,30162,"From there, we move up to this bottle, which is 1 liter."
lixkJv3MLdc,30163,31931,"1.25 liters,"
lixkJv3MLdc,31931,33533,"1.5 liters,"
lixkJv3MLdc,33533,35035,and 2.25 liters.
lixkJv3MLdc,35035,36536,It's worth noting that these ones are only stocked
lixkJv3MLdc,36536,39072,"by a limited number of shops, including Iceland."
lixkJv3MLdc,39072,40640,"The supermarket chain, not the country."
lixkJv3MLdc,40840,43910,"And in the US, our classic Coke comes in these sizes."
lixkJv3MLdc,43910,46446,"The mini can, which is 7.5 ounces."
lixkJv3MLdc,46446,48982,"Then this mini bottle, which is 8 ounces."
lixkJv3MLdc,48982,51150,Then we jump up to the standard 12-ounce can.
lixkJv3MLdc,51151,53319,That also comes in a little 12-ounce bottle.
lixkJv3MLdc,53319,56890,"From there, we got this guy, which is the 16.9 fluid ounces,"
lixkJv3MLdc,56890,59259,aka 500 milliliters.
lixkJv3MLdc,59259,61327,Then we have a 20-ounce bottle.
lixkJv3MLdc,61327,63096,"And finally, our biggest, the 2 liter,"
lixkJv3MLdc,65031,67734,which is also 67.6 ounces.
lixkJv3MLdc,67734,70737,"Now, that means as far as Coca-Cola classic is concerned,"
lixkJv3MLdc,70737,74673,the UK's largest size is actually 12.5% larger
lixkJv3MLdc,74674,75675,than that in the US.
lixkJv3MLdc,75675,77677,There is a reason why we're specifying regular Coke here.
lixkJv3MLdc,77677,79579,"The UK government brought in a sugar tax,"
lixkJv3MLdc,79579,81081,which raised the price of sugary drinks
lixkJv3MLdc,81081,83049,in an effort to reduce people's sugar consumption.
lixkJv3MLdc,83049,85085,"Instead of raising the prices of some of their drinks,"
lixkJv3MLdc,85085,86486,what Coca-Cola did was just to make
lixkJv3MLdc,86486,88621,the sugary versions of their drinks a little bit smaller.
lixkJv3MLdc,88621,90924,"For example, how the normal largest size of regular Coke"
lixkJv3MLdc,90924,92859,"is 1.5 liters,"
lixkJv3MLdc,92859,95662,whereas the largest size of Coke Zero is 2 liters.
lixkJv3MLdc,95795,98364,"Whereas here in the US, we don't have a specific sugar tax."
lixkJv3MLdc,98364,100834,So we can get our bottles of classic Coke and diet Coke
lixkJv3MLdc,100834,102534,in the same size and for the same price.
lixkJv3MLdc,102802,104404,"As a consequence of the UK sugar rules,"
lixkJv3MLdc,104404,106873,it actually means that the 2.25 regular Coke
lixkJv3MLdc,106873,108641,isn't our largest bottle size.
lixkJv3MLdc,108641,109709,That crown
lixkJv3MLdc,109709,110610,[thud]
lixkJv3MLdc,110610,111744,"goes to this,"
lixkJv3MLdc,111744,113713,the 3-liter diet Coke bottle.
lixkJv3MLdc,113713,116015,"Now, this absolute unit is 50% larger"
lixkJv3MLdc,116015,117750,than the biggest bottle in America.
lixkJv3MLdc,117750,119619,"If you're doing, like, a party, maybe?"
lixkJv3MLdc,119619,120920,"If you're buying that for yourself,"
lixkJv3MLdc,120920,123089,"like, you've got a problem."
lixkJv3MLdc,123089,123923,I'm sorry.
lixkJv3MLdc,123923,127460,That is ridiculously huge and really hilarious.
lixkJv3MLdc,127460,130597,"Now, I want to point out that on Walmart.com,"
lixkJv3MLdc,130597,135602,"they have this 3-liter bottle of diet Coke on it,"
lixkJv3MLdc,135602,137570,but it's not available anywhere.
lixkJv3MLdc,137570,140773,"So my assumption is at one point in the United States,"
lixkJv3MLdc,140773,142909,there was 3-liter bottles available.
lixkJv3MLdc,142909,144209,"But if Walmart doesn't have it,"
lixkJv3MLdc,144210,145612,I'm assuming it isn't anywhere.
lixkJv3MLdc,145612,147647,"That being said, in terms of multipack options,"
lixkJv3MLdc,147647,149082,the US still comes out on top.
lixkJv3MLdc,149082,151718,Our single largest multipack
lixkJv3MLdc,151718,155355,is the 35-pack of 12-ounce cans.
lixkJv3MLdc,155355,157357,Let's get a picture of that on the screen.
lixkJv3MLdc,157357,159792,"I ordered it online, and here's what they sent me."
lixkJv3MLdc,163396,167133,"24-pack, and nine loose cans."
lixkJv3MLdc,167133,169502,"Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but what's 24 plus nine?"
lixkJv3MLdc,169502,170637,It ain't 35.
lixkJv3MLdc,170637,172771,"And when I emailed the place that I bought it from,"
lixkJv3MLdc,172772,175108,"they said, ""Oh, sorry, you're missing two cans,"
lixkJv3MLdc,175108,176376,"so we'll just refund you the two cans."""
lixkJv3MLdc,176376,178411,"And I'm like, ""No, I don't want the two cans,"
lixkJv3MLdc,178411,179879,I want the 35-pack
lixkJv3MLdc,179879,181780,"'cause that's what I'm doing for this video,"""
lixkJv3MLdc,181781,183883,"and they just sent me $2 back, so thank you for that."
lixkJv3MLdc,183883,186853,"Anyway, so then I go, nuts to this."
lixkJv3MLdc,186853,188655,I'm going to Walmart.com.
lixkJv3MLdc,188655,190556,Give me the 35-pack.
lixkJv3MLdc,190557,191591,Buy. Enter.
lixkJv3MLdc,191591,193526,And then they sent me
lixkJv3MLdc,197363,200667,"three 12-packs, which is more than 35 cans,"
lixkJv3MLdc,200667,202101,"so I guess technically they're being generous,"
lixkJv3MLdc,202101,205205,"but once again, it's not that I need 35 cans of soda."
lixkJv3MLdc,205205,208374,I need the 35-can pack for this video specifically.
lixkJv3MLdc,208374,211810,"There's a 35-can pack somewhere in America,"
lixkJv3MLdc,211811,215515,and everyone's just sending me roughly 35 cans of soda.
lixkJv3MLdc,215515,216482,Thank you for that.
lixkJv3MLdc,216482,218551,Our largest single item is this.
lixkJv3MLdc,222322,225258,"This is a 24-pack of 330-milliliter cans,"
lixkJv3MLdc,225258,227894,which comes to a total of 7.92 liters.
lixkJv3MLdc,231231,232699,Here is everything that's in regular Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,232699,233733,Harry: Carbonated water. Joe: Carbonated water.
lixkJv3MLdc,233733,234667,Harry: Sugar. Joe: High-fructose corn syrup.
lixkJv3MLdc,234667,236236,Harry: Color (caramel E150d). Joe: Caramel color.
lixkJv3MLdc,236236,237237,Harry: Phosphoric acid. Joe: Phosphoric acid.
lixkJv3MLdc,237237,238805,"Harry: And natural flavorings, Joe: And natural flavors."
lixkJv3MLdc,238805,239872,Harry: including caffeine. Joe: Caffeine.
lixkJv3MLdc,239939,241640,"Now, obviously we don't get a full ingredients list,"
lixkJv3MLdc,241641,244244,because the recipe of Coca-Cola is a closely guarded secret.
lixkJv3MLdc,244244,245778,"At the World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta,"
lixkJv3MLdc,245778,248214,there's reportedly a vault which contains the secret formula
lixkJv3MLdc,248214,249649,written down on a piece of paper.
lixkJv3MLdc,249649,252452,Who cares if the recipe gets loose?
lixkJv3MLdc,252452,254821,"Coca-Cola, no one's gonna edge you up."
lixkJv3MLdc,254821,256256,Pepsi can't beat you.
lixkJv3MLdc,256256,257122,Who cares?
lixkJv3MLdc,257122,258590,"I mean, how do you even make cola?"
lixkJv3MLdc,258591,259792,You probably just go into the factory
lixkJv3MLdc,259792,261393,and eyeball it and figure it out.
lixkJv3MLdc,261394,263763,"It's not super famous because you don't know how to make it,"
lixkJv3MLdc,263763,266699,it's super famous because they edged everybody out.
lixkJv3MLdc,266699,267900,You won.
lixkJv3MLdc,267900,268735,Do you â€“ I don't care.
lixkJv3MLdc,268735,269602,Do you want the recipe?
lixkJv3MLdc,269602,270270,I couldn't care less.
lixkJv3MLdc,270503,272005,"So, what do we know about the recipe?"
lixkJv3MLdc,272005,273172,"Well, there is one obvious difference,"
lixkJv3MLdc,273172,275942,and that's the use of high-fructose corn syrup in the US
lixkJv3MLdc,275942,277844,versus the use of sugar in the UK.
lixkJv3MLdc,278011,280245,Corn syrup is everywhere in American food.
lixkJv3MLdc,280246,282315,It's cheaper for manufacturers to use
lixkJv3MLdc,282315,284484,"because the government gives subsidies to corn farmers,"
lixkJv3MLdc,284484,287186,keeping the corn supply high and the prices low.
lixkJv3MLdc,287186,288521,Should you be worried about consuming
lixkJv3MLdc,288521,289722,high-fructose corn syrup?
lixkJv3MLdc,289722,291156,The short answer is not really.
lixkJv3MLdc,291224,292358,Some studies have suggested
lixkJv3MLdc,292358,293459,that the negative effects of sugar
lixkJv3MLdc,293459,295795,"tend to come from fructose rather than from glucose,"
lixkJv3MLdc,295795,297730,but the high fructose in high-fructose corn syrup
lixkJv3MLdc,297730,299232,only relates to its fructose content
lixkJv3MLdc,299232,300900,in relation to other corn syrups.
lixkJv3MLdc,300900,302235,It actually still has less fructose
lixkJv3MLdc,302235,303836,than table sugar or than honey.
lixkJv3MLdc,304003,306371,The main difference it causes might be the taste.
lixkJv3MLdc,306372,308408,You've heard Americans talk about Mexican Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,308408,310142,You can find it in most Mexican restaurants
lixkJv3MLdc,310143,311277,and in some grocery stores
lixkJv3MLdc,311277,313513,next to the regular Coke in the glass bottle.
lixkJv3MLdc,313513,315281,Mexican Coke is made with cane sugar;
lixkJv3MLdc,315281,317650,our regular Coke is made with high-fructose corn syrup.
lixkJv3MLdc,317784,320153,People tend to like the Mexican Coke more
lixkJv3MLdc,320153,321988,because it has a sweeter sugary taste.
lixkJv3MLdc,321988,326092,"So right now to compare and contrast,"
lixkJv3MLdc,326092,327727,I'm going to do a blind taste test
lixkJv3MLdc,327727,331731,of both American Coke and Mexican Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,331731,332899,Hang on.
lixkJv3MLdc,332899,336268,And Harry was nice enough to send me
lixkJv3MLdc,336269,338338,a United Kingdom Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,338571,340673,"I've also got some British Coke, some Mexican Coke,"
lixkJv3MLdc,340673,341841,and some American Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,341841,342942,I'm now going to blindfold myself
lixkJv3MLdc,342942,344376,"and let our camera operator, Sarah,"
lixkJv3MLdc,344377,346312,pour the Cokes out for me.
lixkJv3MLdc,346312,347980,I'm blindfolded. I don't know which one's which.
lixkJv3MLdc,347980,349082,I'm going to try them one after the other
lixkJv3MLdc,349082,350316,and try and figure out which one's which.
lixkJv3MLdc,350316,352051,I'm going to start on the right.
lixkJv3MLdc,353252,355021,"Hm. See, it could just be mind games,"
lixkJv3MLdc,355021,357623,but that doesn't taste like exactly what I'm used to.
lixkJv3MLdc,357623,358724,No. 2.
lixkJv3MLdc,360560,362628,Ooh. OK. That one tastes pretty good.
lixkJv3MLdc,362628,363763,No. 3.
lixkJv3MLdc,363763,365732,These two taste pretty similar.
lixkJv3MLdc,366666,368301,This one tastes a bit weird for some reason.
lixkJv3MLdc,368301,372372,"I'm going to guess that this one is American, on the right."
lixkJv3MLdc,372372,374841,"I was expecting more of a difference, I'll be honest."
lixkJv3MLdc,374841,378211,"I'll go with British in the middle, Mexican on my left."
lixkJv3MLdc,378211,380246,"Put them in front of me, and then I'll unblindfold myself."
lixkJv3MLdc,381848,382849,Wow. OK.
lixkJv3MLdc,382849,384650,That was Mexican Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,384650,386953,I was right about British.
lixkJv3MLdc,386953,389355,I just got Mexican and American Coke mixed up.
lixkJv3MLdc,389355,390189,Wow. OK.
lixkJv3MLdc,390189,392625,"A lot of people have really hyped up Mexican Coke to me,"
lixkJv3MLdc,392625,394594,"and I honestly, like,"
lixkJv3MLdc,394594,396229,that was my least favorite of the three.
lixkJv3MLdc,404170,405505,They taste exactly the same.
lixkJv3MLdc,405505,410042,"So I'm going to go UK, Mexico, USA."
lixkJv3MLdc,410042,410977,"Wow, really?"
lixkJv3MLdc,410977,413712,"[""America the Beautiful"" plays]"
lixkJv3MLdc,413713,417150,I'm so great at pointless things!
lixkJv3MLdc,417283,418951,Any other ingredients to look out for?
lixkJv3MLdc,418951,420586,"Well, one of them might be caramel color."
lixkJv3MLdc,420586,422388,"As we know, certain classes of caramel color"
lixkJv3MLdc,422388,424857,have a byproduct which has been linked to causing cancer.
lixkJv3MLdc,424857,426859,"Unfortunately, the caramel E150d"
lixkJv3MLdc,426859,429362,that Coke in the UK uses is one of these classes.
lixkJv3MLdc,429362,431297,We reached out to Coca-Cola here in the US
lixkJv3MLdc,431297,432565,"to see if that was the case,"
lixkJv3MLdc,432565,435134,because the type is not specified on the label.
lixkJv3MLdc,435134,436869,They told us that it is in fact
lixkJv3MLdc,436869,441039,the same E150d caramel color in the States.
lixkJv3MLdc,441274,442474,But what about diet Coke?
lixkJv3MLdc,442475,443910,"It still contains caramel color,"
lixkJv3MLdc,443910,446245,"but instead of using sugar and corn syrup to sweeten it,"
lixkJv3MLdc,446245,448181,"in the US it's sweetened with aspartame,"
lixkJv3MLdc,448181,449982,and in the UK it's sweetened with aspartame
lixkJv3MLdc,449982,451617,as well acesulfame K.
lixkJv3MLdc,451617,453953,The good news is that both the EU and the FDA say
lixkJv3MLdc,453953,456088,that acesulfame K is safe for consumption.
lixkJv3MLdc,456088,457623,"In terms of the difference with Coke Zero,"
lixkJv3MLdc,457623,461360,"in the US, our Coke Zero uses ace K as well as aspartame."
lixkJv3MLdc,461360,462794,Rumors have existed for years claiming
lixkJv3MLdc,462795,464297,"that aspartame causes cancer,"
lixkJv3MLdc,464297,466599,but it turns out that that is likely to be false.
lixkJv3MLdc,466599,468901,The claims originated from some Italian researchers
lixkJv3MLdc,468901,470536,way back in 2005.
lixkJv3MLdc,470536,472205,"I feel like I heard about that in the '80s, but OK."
lixkJv3MLdc,472205,473806,People were quick to call their methods
lixkJv3MLdc,473806,475842,and results into question.
lixkJv3MLdc,475842,477243,"The FDA says, ""the use of aspartame"
lixkJv3MLdc,477243,478945,"as a general ... sweetener ... is safe."""
lixkJv3MLdc,478945,480913,"While the European Food Safety Authority says,"
lixkJv3MLdc,480913,482915,"""Studies do not suggest an increased risk"
lixkJv3MLdc,482915,484617,associated with the aspartame consumption
lixkJv3MLdc,484617,487220,"for ... leukemia, brain tumours or a variety of cancers."""
lixkJv3MLdc,488387,489755,There's a cool side effect for Coke
lixkJv3MLdc,489755,492024,using these artificial sweeteners you might not know about.
lixkJv3MLdc,492024,494861,"Because they're so much more sweet than sugar per pound,"
lixkJv3MLdc,494861,497530,there's a tiny amount of them dissolved in your diet Coke
lixkJv3MLdc,497530,499365,compared to the amount of sugar that's in a classic Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,499365,502401,That means a can of Coke is denser than that of a diet Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,502401,504837,So when you put said Coke in water ...
lixkJv3MLdc,506706,507707,to the bottom.
lixkJv3MLdc,507707,508708,Diet Coke ...
lixkJv3MLdc,512945,513913,floats.
lixkJv3MLdc,514180,515748,One other rumor we felt compelled to address
lixkJv3MLdc,515748,517917,was the role of cocaine in Coca-Cola.
lixkJv3MLdc,517917,519417,This dates right back to the 1800s
lixkJv3MLdc,519418,520386,when the drink was invented.
lixkJv3MLdc,520386,522420,Coca-Cola's official stance on this
lixkJv3MLdc,522421,525591,is that there's never been cocaine in any of its products.
lixkJv3MLdc,525591,529529,"What it does seem to contain, however, is coca extract."
lixkJv3MLdc,529529,532031,Coca is the plant from which cocaine is extracted.
lixkJv3MLdc,532031,533933,Fluid extract of coca was one of the ingredients
lixkJv3MLdc,533933,535967,"in a list ""This American Life"" discovered"
lixkJv3MLdc,535968,537236,which was reportedly a recipe
lixkJv3MLdc,537236,538804,for an early version of Coca-Cola.
lixkJv3MLdc,538804,540172,And it seems like they're still using it.
lixkJv3MLdc,540172,543075,"In 1988, a Coca-Cola spokesperson said,"
lixkJv3MLdc,543075,545177,"""Ingredients from the coca leaf are used,"
lixkJv3MLdc,545177,547246,but there is no cocaine in it
lixkJv3MLdc,547246,549147,and it all is being tightly overseen
lixkJv3MLdc,549148,550683,"by regulatory authorities."""
lixkJv3MLdc,550683,552951,What's fun is that Coca-Cola got a specific exemption
lixkJv3MLdc,552952,555021,from the United Nations in order to keep using
lixkJv3MLdc,555021,556622,coca extract as an ingredient.
lixkJv3MLdc,556622,558357,"Specifically, Article 27"
lixkJv3MLdc,558357,561326,of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.
lixkJv3MLdc,561761,562795,There's only one facility in the US
lixkJv3MLdc,562795,564764,licensed to import and process coca leaves
lixkJv3MLdc,564764,567165,through a special deal with the DEA.
lixkJv3MLdc,567166,569502,"It is owned by the Stepan Company,"
lixkJv3MLdc,569502,571170,"and it's in Maywood, New Jersey."
lixkJv3MLdc,571170,572672,"According to the Peruvian officials,"
lixkJv3MLdc,572672,576042,they buy around 100 metric tons
lixkJv3MLdc,576042,579345,of dried Peruvian coca leaves each year.
lixkJv3MLdc,579345,581714,"They reportedly process them and de-cocanize them,"
lixkJv3MLdc,581714,583516,taking all of the cocaine out of them.
lixkJv3MLdc,583516,586218,"The cocaine is sold to hospitals for use as an anesthetic,"
lixkJv3MLdc,586218,587687,and the cocaine-free extract
lixkJv3MLdc,587687,589555,is then sent to Coca-Cola for use in their products.
lixkJv3MLdc,589722,592625,"Coca-Cola's official line on the subject is, quote,"
lixkJv3MLdc,592625,594827,"""Coca-Cola does not contain cocaine"
lixkJv3MLdc,594827,596862,"or any other harmful substance,"
lixkJv3MLdc,596862,598831,and cocaine has never been
lixkJv3MLdc,598831,601000,"an added ingredient in Coca-Cola."""
lixkJv3MLdc,601000,601767,End quote.
lixkJv3MLdc,601968,604403,But it's fair to say that cocaine and coca extract
lixkJv3MLdc,604403,605571,are not the same thing.
lixkJv3MLdc,605571,607105,So the latter might in fact be
lixkJv3MLdc,607106,608908,one of their not-so-secret secret ingredients.
lixkJv3MLdc,612478,614246,Here are all the Coca-Cola products in the UK
lixkJv3MLdc,614246,615647,that you won't find in the US.
lixkJv3MLdc,615648,618117,And here's all the Coca-Cola items you'll find in the US
lixkJv3MLdc,618117,619318,that you cannot find in the UK.
lixkJv3MLdc,619318,620820,I want to start with two exclusive flavors
lixkJv3MLdc,620820,622788,you can get in the US you can't get in the UK.
lixkJv3MLdc,622788,623756,"They're these two right here,"
lixkJv3MLdc,623756,625891,cherry vanilla and orange vanilla.
lixkJv3MLdc,626092,627326,Cherry vanilla seems pretty standard.
lixkJv3MLdc,627326,629095,I think I've had this a bunch of times.
lixkJv3MLdc,629095,631097,It's great. It's refreshing. I enjoy it.
lixkJv3MLdc,631664,633165,"We can't get cherry vanilla in the UK,"
lixkJv3MLdc,633165,635201,"but we can get cherry and we can get vanilla,"
lixkJv3MLdc,635201,636402,so I guess I can make my own.
lixkJv3MLdc,638304,640006,"Oh, God. Ah!"
lixkJv3MLdc,640006,641740,[exhales]
lixkJv3MLdc,643142,644343,[exhales]
lixkJv3MLdc,644343,645678,Panic over.
lixkJv3MLdc,645678,647613,"The smart thing to do would be to mix these in a glass,"
lixkJv3MLdc,647613,648847,but I'm not a smart man.
lixkJv3MLdc,652018,652852,Ah.
lixkJv3MLdc,652852,654420,Pretty good.
lixkJv3MLdc,654420,656321,The only exclusive Coke flavor we can currently get â€“
lixkJv3MLdc,656322,657189,[coughs] sorry.
lixkJv3MLdc,657189,658991,The only exclusive Coke flavor we can currently get
lixkJv3MLdc,658991,661460,"in the UK is this one, which is diet Coke Sublime Lime."
lixkJv3MLdc,661694,662595,"As the name suggests,"
lixkJv3MLdc,662595,664029,it's just diet Coke flavored with lime.
lixkJv3MLdc,664030,665931,"Next up, caffeine-free Coca-Cola,"
lixkJv3MLdc,665965,668901,"not to be confused with caffeine-free diet Coke,"
lixkJv3MLdc,668901,670970,which is what you guys have over there in the UK.
lixkJv3MLdc,670970,673371,Apparently that's your only caffeine-free option?
lixkJv3MLdc,673372,674273,For shame.
lixkJv3MLdc,674273,675608,This one is delicious.
lixkJv3MLdc,675608,676909,It actually tastes just like Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,677410,678511,It's perfect for after 2 p.m.
lixkJv3MLdc,678511,680112,"when you want to keep drinking soda, like me."
lixkJv3MLdc,680513,682615,But if you like caffeine
lixkJv3MLdc,682615,684216,"and you want a little bit of a boost,"
lixkJv3MLdc,684216,687319,"Coke Energy I believe is available in both countries,"
lixkJv3MLdc,687319,689488,but one exclusive Coke Energy flavor
lixkJv3MLdc,689488,691891,you can't get in the UK is this.
lixkJv3MLdc,691891,694727,The Coke Energy zero sugar.
lixkJv3MLdc,694727,697128,The Coke Energy drinks are being phased out.
lixkJv3MLdc,697129,697963,I can't imagine why.
lixkJv3MLdc,697963,699165,I think they're actually really good.
lixkJv3MLdc,699165,703035,"In fact, I went ahead and got the other ones."
lixkJv3MLdc,703035,705337,"Regular. I don't really like zero sugar,"
lixkJv3MLdc,705337,707405,but I do like just regular.
lixkJv3MLdc,712111,713646,"Oh, yeah."
lixkJv3MLdc,713646,715114,I'm into that.
lixkJv3MLdc,715114,716115,"Yeah, thank you."
lixkJv3MLdc,717683,719151,"It's good. I mean, like ..."
lixkJv3MLdc,721087,723855,"energy meter's going up, Yuelei!"
lixkJv3MLdc,723856,725224,Going up!
lixkJv3MLdc,728360,731130,"If you're like me and you love soda and coffee,"
lixkJv3MLdc,731130,733399,Coke in the US has you covered with these.
lixkJv3MLdc,733566,738404,"You got caramel, vanilla, vanilla no sugar,"
lixkJv3MLdc,738404,741507,"dark blend, and dark blend zero sugar."
lixkJv3MLdc,741774,744977,"Oh, my God, I sincerely love these so much."
lixkJv3MLdc,746112,748314,Zero sugar can go there.
lixkJv3MLdc,748314,749615,"Ooh, which one do I want?"
lixkJv3MLdc,753219,754053,Hits the spot.
lixkJv3MLdc,754053,756488,The I-want-to-jack-my-caffeine-levels-
lixkJv3MLdc,756489,758090,through-the-roof spot.
lixkJv3MLdc,758090,759792,"Dude, Coke and coffee's good together."
lixkJv3MLdc,759792,761326,Has anyone had two of these at the same time?
lixkJv3MLdc,761327,762528,I don't think they have.
lixkJv3MLdc,765731,766966,They don't mix very well.
lixkJv3MLdc,768000,770236,But individually they're great.
lixkJv3MLdc,771237,772204,Uh-oh.
lixkJv3MLdc,777843,778711,I might have overdone it.
lixkJv3MLdc,778711,780112,We don't have Coke coffees in the UK.
lixkJv3MLdc,780112,782181,"However, Coca-Cola owns Costa Coffee,"
lixkJv3MLdc,782181,783582,"which is a coffee chain in the UK,"
lixkJv3MLdc,783582,785116,and they produce canned coffees.
lixkJv3MLdc,785117,787253,"So I guess, again, I can try and make my own."
lixkJv3MLdc,788187,791490,"So, the issue here is they do do Americanos,"
lixkJv3MLdc,791490,793024,but I got latte instead.
lixkJv3MLdc,794493,798063,"So see how well milk combines with Coke, I guess."
lixkJv3MLdc,800766,803869,Yeah. Um. [laughs]
lixkJv3MLdc,803869,806572,Regretting quite a lot of things right now.
lixkJv3MLdc,806572,809275,Namely all the life choices that led me to this point.
lixkJv3MLdc,809275,810109,Cheers.
lixkJv3MLdc,820386,821587,Nope.
lixkJv3MLdc,823055,824290,Not even a little bit.
lixkJv3MLdc,824290,825591,"No, no, no."
lixkJv3MLdc,825591,826458,Don't do that.
lixkJv3MLdc,826458,827293,No one else do that.
lixkJv3MLdc,827293,828861,"Please, God. Ugh."
lixkJv3MLdc,828861,831497,"Just like really watery, fizzy coffee"
lixkJv3MLdc,831497,834400,that is kind of sweet and ... ugh.
lixkJv3MLdc,834400,835434,No. Bad.
lixkJv3MLdc,836335,838304,"The final exclusive range in the UK is this,"
lixkJv3MLdc,838370,839839,Coca-Cola signature mixers.
lixkJv3MLdc,840072,841307,Coca-Cola worked with bartenders
lixkJv3MLdc,841307,843409,to design special Cokes with different flavors
lixkJv3MLdc,843409,844844,which are designed to be used in cocktails.
lixkJv3MLdc,844977,848514,"These come with smoky notes, spicy notes,"
lixkJv3MLdc,848514,850182,"herbal notes, and woody notes."
lixkJv3MLdc,850282,852151,Tag yourself. I am spicy notes.
lixkJv3MLdc,852318,852985,Cool.
lixkJv3MLdc,853586,855654,[rumbling]
lixkJv3MLdc,855654,858157,My stomach is making some weird noises after drinking that.
lixkJv3MLdc,858157,860725,"No one else do that, please, God. Ugh!"
lixkJv3MLdc,860726,862094,Apparently these are designed to be enjoyed
lixkJv3MLdc,862094,863628,with premium dark spirits.
lixkJv3MLdc,863629,865631,"Now, I know nothing about mixology, but thankfully,"
lixkJv3MLdc,865631,867433,a bartender friend from Australia
lixkJv3MLdc,867433,868500,came through with a recipe.
lixkJv3MLdc,868500,870669,So now I'm going to use the smoky notes Coca-Cola
lixkJv3MLdc,870669,871737,"to put a ""Food Wars"" twist"
lixkJv3MLdc,871737,873172,on a Jack's godfather highball.
lixkJv3MLdc,873172,874073,Cocktail Time.
lixkJv3MLdc,875608,876241,Slight hiccup.
lixkJv3MLdc,876508,877443,Don't have a bottle opener.
lixkJv3MLdc,879578,880646,This is either going to work
lixkJv3MLdc,880646,883015,or I'm going to break my keys and be locked out of my house.
lixkJv3MLdc,888487,889622,Improvisation.
lixkJv3MLdc,890189,890890,Slash.
lixkJv3MLdc,890890,891657,Alcoholism.
lixkJv3MLdc,891991,893659,"Ooh, it does smell quite smoky."
lixkJv3MLdc,893859,896362,"Harry was kind enough to send me this,"
lixkJv3MLdc,896362,897496,so now I have one as well.
lixkJv3MLdc,897663,900566,"It just says, ""Pour ingredients into an ice-filled glass."""
lixkJv3MLdc,900566,903769,Formally apologize to any actual bartenders
lixkJv3MLdc,903769,907172,who are watching this while I butcher your profession.
lixkJv3MLdc,907172,910376,"30 milliliters of Tennessee whiskey we have,"
lixkJv3MLdc,910376,912211,and then 20 milliliters of Disaronno.
lixkJv3MLdc,913379,914813,A delightful smoky Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,917316,918651,Next we mix together.
lixkJv3MLdc,920719,921987,"And there you have it. Thanks to Coke,"
lixkJv3MLdc,921987,924857,we've put our own spin on a Jack's godfather highball.
lixkJv3MLdc,924857,925691,Cheers.
lixkJv3MLdc,927326,928661,Ooh. That's delicious.
lixkJv3MLdc,928894,932431,"Um, yeah, I'm not going to make that drink,"
lixkJv3MLdc,932431,933499,'cause I don't have all that stuff.
lixkJv3MLdc,933499,935834,So I'm going to go ahead and make a Joe highball.
lixkJv3MLdc,936001,938771,"First, get yourself the biggest glass available."
lixkJv3MLdc,938771,940506,Step two: no ice.
lixkJv3MLdc,940506,941440,Find yourself some whiskey.
lixkJv3MLdc,951483,952116,"Cheers, my man."
lixkJv3MLdc,956722,957823,"Oh, man."
lixkJv3MLdc,958924,959858,What is in this?
lixkJv3MLdc,959858,961759,"If I was to do it again, I'd use less of this."
lixkJv3MLdc,963429,964430,"It's iced tea, guys."
lixkJv3MLdc,965564,966765,I'm not gonna f---ing drink whiskey
lixkJv3MLdc,966765,967733,this early in the morning.
lixkJv3MLdc,969568,970369,You know what it tastes like?
lixkJv3MLdc,970636,971737,Flat Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,971971,973038,"Oh, man, I'm getting a headache though."
lixkJv3MLdc,973238,976108,"Last but not least, in the US, you have the option"
lixkJv3MLdc,976108,978243,to order customized Coke bottles.
lixkJv3MLdc,978243,979878,Check out the one I made.
lixkJv3MLdc,979878,981714,Joe and Harry.
lixkJv3MLdc,988287,990122,Here's everything that's in a 500-milliliter bottle
lixkJv3MLdc,990122,992124,of Coca-Cola in the UK.
lixkJv3MLdc,992124,993659,And here's everything in that same bottle
lixkJv3MLdc,993659,995094,of classic Coke in the US.
lixkJv3MLdc,996562,997663,That means that the UK's version
lixkJv3MLdc,997663,999732,actually has slightly more calories in it than the US.
lixkJv3MLdc,999765,1001033,Joe: And we have more sugar.
lixkJv3MLdc,1001033,1003502,"And for some reason, our Coke has a little bit of sodium,"
lixkJv3MLdc,1003502,1005104,while the UK seems to have none.
lixkJv3MLdc,1005237,1007840,"Obviously, the main thing to look out for here is the sugar."
lixkJv3MLdc,1007840,1010109,500 milliliters in both the US and the UK
lixkJv3MLdc,1010109,1012344,contains over 100% of your daily allowance.
lixkJv3MLdc,1012344,1015047,53 grams of sugar. [laughs]
lixkJv3MLdc,1015047,1016448,"It does put it in perspective, doesn't it?"
lixkJv3MLdc,1016448,1017883,"You never see it laid out like that,"
lixkJv3MLdc,1017883,1019318,but that is how much sugar is in Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,1019318,1020953,And I drink a lot of Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,1020953,1021420,That's concerning.
lixkJv3MLdc,1021553,1023789,It's also worth noting that both countries
lixkJv3MLdc,1023789,1025758,put the same amount of caffeine in their Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,1025858,1027626,"For reference, the average cup of filtered coffee"
lixkJv3MLdc,1027626,1029627,contains about 96 milligrams of caffeine.
lixkJv3MLdc,1029694,1031964,So that's exactly double the amount in this bottle of Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,1032031,1034032,"Interestingly, diet Coke is actually more caffeinated"
lixkJv3MLdc,1034032,1034899,than regular Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,1034933,1036668,"There's 63 milligrams in this bottle,"
lixkJv3MLdc,1036668,1037935,which is a 30% increase.
lixkJv3MLdc,1038069,1040538,"And it makes sense, 'cause our Coke with coffee"
lixkJv3MLdc,1040538,1044142,contains 69 milligrams of caffeine per 12 fluid ounces.
lixkJv3MLdc,1044142,1046078,"If you do the math to find out the figure per ounce,"
lixkJv3MLdc,1046078,1047678,it's double the caffeine of a regular Coke.
lixkJv3MLdc,1047678,1051149,But the real caffeine king is my boy Coke Energy.
lixkJv3MLdc,1053419,1054352,Mm.
lixkJv3MLdc,1055320,1057823,"Whether you get the classic or the cherry,"
lixkJv3MLdc,1057823,1061727,"the 12-ounce can contains 114 milligrams of caffeine,"
lixkJv3MLdc,1061727,1063729,which is triple the caffeine content
lixkJv3MLdc,1063729,1065998,of a regular Coke per ounce.
lixkJv3MLdc,1065998,1068300,"Yo, don't I know it."
lixkJv3MLdc,1068300,1069535,I'm going to chug as much of this as I can
lixkJv3MLdc,1069535,1071270,without throwing up and then see what we can do.
lixkJv3MLdc,1073505,1076075,[burps loudly]
lixkJv3MLdc,1076075,1077075,"God, that's so gross."
lixkJv3MLdc,1077076,1079211,"The max I got to there was 90 decibels,"
lixkJv3MLdc,1079211,1080712,"which, according to this thing I found,"
lixkJv3MLdc,1080712,1083715,"is about as loud as a leaf blower, which is pretty good."
