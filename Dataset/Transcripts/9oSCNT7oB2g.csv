9oSCNT7oB2g,7040,8639,hey it's
9oSCNT7oB2g,8639,10000,hey
9oSCNT7oB2g,10000,12639,hey it's me today i'm going to be making
9oSCNT7oB2g,12639,15120,some art with a new product that i've
9oSCNT7oB2g,15120,17760,never used before and i'm very excited
9oSCNT7oB2g,17760,20000,about it here
9oSCNT7oB2g,20000,22320,they are
9oSCNT7oB2g,22320,25519,books no it's not books these are paint
9oSCNT7oB2g,25519,28320,markers i am currently obsessed with
9oSCNT7oB2g,28320,31119,posca paint pens oh gosh pastas i love
9oSCNT7oB2g,31119,33200,pasta so much the only problem i have
9oSCNT7oB2g,33200,35680,with pastas really is the limited color
9oSCNT7oB2g,35680,38719,range this is a whole different brand of
9oSCNT7oB2g,38719,40879,paint marker and as you can see there
9oSCNT7oB2g,40879,45320,are a ton of colors available
9oSCNT7oB2g,46000,48160,so if these work as well as poscas
9oSCNT7oB2g,48160,50320,i will make the switch right now my
9oSCNT7oB2g,50320,53440,loyalty goes wherever the color is
9oSCNT7oB2g,53440,55760,i actually heard about these from chloe
9oSCNT7oB2g,55760,57920,her channel is chloe roseart and she
9oSCNT7oB2g,57920,60399,does art she actually reached out to me
9oSCNT7oB2g,60399,62320,because she tested them out on her
9oSCNT7oB2g,62320,63920,channel and noticed a bunch of people in
9oSCNT7oB2g,63920,66080,the comments saying that i should use
9oSCNT7oB2g,66080,67280,them
9oSCNT7oB2g,67280,69439,how thoughtful and sweet and kind of you
9oSCNT7oB2g,69439,71200,guys as soon as she showed me these i
9oSCNT7oB2g,71200,73600,was like yes i'm buying them i saw the
9oSCNT7oB2g,73600,76560,price and i said
9oSCNT7oB2g,76640,79439,okay
9oSCNT7oB2g,79439,81360,i'm still buying them there are a ton of
9oSCNT7oB2g,81360,83360,markers in here if you bought this many
9oSCNT7oB2g,83360,86640,pasta pens it wouldn't be cheap either
9oSCNT7oB2g,86640,89439,put that back they are called karen
9oSCNT7oB2g,89439,92400,markers each box has kind of a different
9oSCNT7oB2g,92400,94880,theme i'm not overly excited about the
9oSCNT7oB2g,94880,98320,gray box so let's get this one over with
9oSCNT7oB2g,98320,102640,very nice box pop this open wow fancy
9oSCNT7oB2g,102640,104399,they have this little card in here for
9oSCNT7oB2g,104399,106479,swatching and
9oSCNT7oB2g,106479,107759,probably won't use it but it's in there
9oSCNT7oB2g,107759,109680,it's a nice thought in the gray box
9oSCNT7oB2g,109680,111439,surprise we've got a lot of gray they
9oSCNT7oB2g,111439,114159,also get quite green i would definitely
9oSCNT7oB2g,114159,117920,not call this color gray
9oSCNT7oB2g,118320,120399,okay that can be gray
9oSCNT7oB2g,120399,123119,this one
9oSCNT7oB2g,123280,129039,basic colors next nature colors
9oSCNT7oB2g,129039,131520,that was a monkey for nature we'll see
9oSCNT7oB2g,131520,133120,when all of them are combined how much
9oSCNT7oB2g,133120,135360,of each color we have
9oSCNT7oB2g,135360,138000,nude colors
9oSCNT7oB2g,138000,140640,this is like a very repetitive christmas
9oSCNT7oB2g,140640,142800,oh lovely i know they're supposed to be
9oSCNT7oB2g,142800,144879,for like skin tones and stuff but i see
9oSCNT7oB2g,144879,148800,desserts next passion colors whatever
9oSCNT7oB2g,148800,150959,that means this is what passion colors
9oSCNT7oB2g,150959,153519,look like they look kind of random to me
9oSCNT7oB2g,153519,155760,this is the one that i'm really looking
9oSCNT7oB2g,155760,159360,forward to it is the pastel colors
9oSCNT7oB2g,159360,161519,poscas definitely don't have any good
9oSCNT7oB2g,161519,164080,pastel colors this is closer to pastel
9oSCNT7oB2g,164080,166400,than what pasca has to offer so i am
9oSCNT7oB2g,166400,168319,excited to use these it would look much
9oSCNT7oB2g,168319,170400,prettier if they were in rainbow order
9oSCNT7oB2g,170400,173120,but that's just me i have no idea what
9oSCNT7oB2g,173120,175120,i'm gonna use these markers on i'll
9oSCNT7oB2g,175120,177440,figure something out so let's get into
9oSCNT7oB2g,177440,179840,doing that now welcome to my blue
9oSCNT7oB2g,179840,184760,workspace and the markers are here
9oSCNT7oB2g,187680,189519,that's me clapping i'm gonna go ahead
9oSCNT7oB2g,189519,192239,and pick pick pick pull all of these out
9oSCNT7oB2g,192239,194159,and we're left with this very beautiful
9oSCNT7oB2g,194159,196720,very expensive packaging but
9oSCNT7oB2g,196720,198319,unfortunately i don't really need it so
9oSCNT7oB2g,198319,200000,i'm just gonna i'm just gonna put it to
9oSCNT7oB2g,200000,202239,the side um maybe it'll find a purpose
9oSCNT7oB2g,202239,204879,over there on the side yeah
9oSCNT7oB2g,204879,207360,next okay yeah i'm taking the markers
9oSCNT7oB2g,207360,208799,out of the packaging which means i'm
9oSCNT7oB2g,208799,210560,gonna be tossing all of it
9oSCNT7oB2g,210560,212640,having all the markers separated out
9oSCNT7oB2g,212640,214319,like this it's not going to be conducive
9oSCNT7oB2g,214319,216640,to my creativity and i really hate to do
9oSCNT7oB2g,216640,218640,it look at that loving caress but
9oSCNT7oB2g,218640,220319,throwing all these markers in one big
9oSCNT7oB2g,220319,221920,container is just going to be way less
9oSCNT7oB2g,221920,224319,annoying so it's a good buy my dear
9oSCNT7oB2g,224319,226959,enjoy the rest of your life in the trash
9oSCNT7oB2g,226959,229599,and thank you for nothing it's a box i'm
9oSCNT7oB2g,229599,231760,over it geez i'm like a wild animal and
9oSCNT7oB2g,231760,234159,finally here are all the markers naked
9oSCNT7oB2g,234159,236640,and free it is now clear just how many
9oSCNT7oB2g,236640,238799,there are here and i'm gonna go ham
9oSCNT7oB2g,238799,241200,swatching honestly i kind of hate
9oSCNT7oB2g,241200,243680,swatching i hate swatching as much as i
9oSCNT7oB2g,243680,247040,hate saying the word swatching swatching
9oSCNT7oB2g,247040,249599,swatching it's just not how i prefer to
9oSCNT7oB2g,249599,251840,spend my time i mean look at that that's
9oSCNT7oB2g,251840,254400,so boring but i felt like it was
9oSCNT7oB2g,254400,256320,necessary to really lay out all of the
9oSCNT7oB2g,256320,257759,colors and i really wanted to see the
9oSCNT7oB2g,257759,260320,full color range ah will it ever end oh
9oSCNT7oB2g,260320,262160,there we go it ended and ignore that
9oSCNT7oB2g,262160,264800,little mark it's just here to ruin my
9oSCNT7oB2g,264800,266800,life really in with the drama now it's
9oSCNT7oB2g,266800,268880,clear that there is in fact a pretty
9oSCNT7oB2g,268880,270880,even balance of colors here could have
9oSCNT7oB2g,270880,273680,used a few more brown and tans and less
9oSCNT7oB2g,273680,275759,gray but that's fine moving on i needed
9oSCNT7oB2g,275759,278479,to decide what exactly to use these pens
9oSCNT7oB2g,278479,280560,on you know how i get with decisions i
9oSCNT7oB2g,280560,282960,tend to lose it i got so overwhelmed by
9oSCNT7oB2g,282960,284960,the choice i ended up sitting right back
9oSCNT7oB2g,284960,286800,down and just pulling out a piece of
9oSCNT7oB2g,286800,288560,paper at first i was thinking i was
9oSCNT7oB2g,288560,290560,going to customize something really cool
9oSCNT7oB2g,290560,294320,and unique you know like a like a a a
9oSCNT7oB2g,294320,295919,underwear i don't know but then i
9oSCNT7oB2g,295919,297840,thought i've never used these markers
9oSCNT7oB2g,297840,299600,before so i just want to you know get a
9oSCNT7oB2g,299600,301360,feel for them so i literally sketched
9oSCNT7oB2g,301360,303199,out the first thing that came to mind i
9oSCNT7oB2g,303199,304800,started sketching so quickly i'm not
9oSCNT7oB2g,304800,307120,even sure my brain fully processed what
9oSCNT7oB2g,307120,308880,i was doing what's my hand doing i don't
9oSCNT7oB2g,308880,311360,know in my mind this was just a test run
9oSCNT7oB2g,311360,312960,i'm just messing around here what what
9oSCNT7oB2g,312960,315120,what am i doing i'll i'm going in with
9oSCNT7oB2g,315120,316960,the color so i thought that these were
9oSCNT7oB2g,316960,319199,just like poscas so i was creating
9oSCNT7oB2g,319199,321600,somewhat of a blocky kind of cartoon
9oSCNT7oB2g,321600,323520,style which is what i end up doing with
9oSCNT7oB2g,323520,325600,poscas most of the time but then while i
9oSCNT7oB2g,325600,328160,was painting this little star i noticed
9oSCNT7oB2g,328160,330479,that they actually do kind of blend
9oSCNT7oB2g,330479,332800,thanks to the flexible brush tip which
9oSCNT7oB2g,332800,334479,is actually very different from the one
9oSCNT7oB2g,334479,336320,that's on the posca so i started kind of
9oSCNT7oB2g,336320,337919,you know trying that out messing around
9oSCNT7oB2g,337919,339600,with the blending a little bit also i
9oSCNT7oB2g,339600,341919,wanted to test out as many colors as i
9oSCNT7oB2g,341919,343840,could so i end up making some very
9oSCNT7oB2g,343840,345360,interesting color choices what have i
9oSCNT7oB2g,345360,348400,done it looks like a half digested globe
9oSCNT7oB2g,348400,350479,yes let me attempt to explain what
9oSCNT7oB2g,350479,352880,exactly i'm drawing here first i have to
9oSCNT7oB2g,352880,354720,figure it out myself you know you can
9oSCNT7oB2g,354720,357759,tell by the evolution of this mysterious
9oSCNT7oB2g,357759,359919,earthy orb that i have no clue what i'm
9oSCNT7oB2g,359919,362880,doing this drawing started as lollipops
9oSCNT7oB2g,362880,364960,and popsicles very simple but then i
9oSCNT7oB2g,364960,366400,thought you know how are they standing
9oSCNT7oB2g,366400,367840,up on their own am i going to draw
9oSCNT7oB2g,367840,370720,another mysteriously balanced popsicle
9oSCNT7oB2g,370720,372800,no i decided that this is going to be a
9oSCNT7oB2g,372800,375759,close-up of the top of a cake so then
9oSCNT7oB2g,375759,377520,they turned into like little cake
9oSCNT7oB2g,377520,380080,toppers i could lie and say yeah this is
9oSCNT7oB2g,380080,382240,going perfectly and it's working just
9oSCNT7oB2g,382240,384880,how i wanted i'm really doing a good job
9oSCNT7oB2g,384880,387280,but i think it's pretty obvious i was
9oSCNT7oB2g,387280,390319,struggling a lot like a lot a lot a lot
9oSCNT7oB2g,390319,391840,these markers definitely worked
9oSCNT7oB2g,391840,394319,differently than i expected when i was
9oSCNT7oB2g,394319,396800,swatching them they seemed pretty opaque
9oSCNT7oB2g,396800,399440,but once i started using them i realized
9oSCNT7oB2g,399440,402080,they are not trying to layer a lighter
9oSCNT7oB2g,402080,405120,color on top of a darker color no worky
9oSCNT7oB2g,405120,406720,the lighter the color the more
9oSCNT7oB2g,406720,408720,transparent they are it was very
9oSCNT7oB2g,408720,411440,difficult to get a clean color on top of
9oSCNT7oB2g,411440,414479,another color they kind of mixed oh no
9oSCNT7oB2g,414479,416479,even if you wait for it to dry and add
9oSCNT7oB2g,416479,418400,another layer it does the same thing
9oSCNT7oB2g,418400,420639,again so this was not really going
9oSCNT7oB2g,420639,423840,according to plan not that i really even
9oSCNT7oB2g,423840,427039,had a plan but if i did have a plan it
9oSCNT7oB2g,427039,429520,would not be this i am still just trying
9oSCNT7oB2g,429520,432000,to get to know this supply and see what
9oSCNT7oB2g,432000,433919,it does but i'm also aware that i've
9oSCNT7oB2g,433919,435840,spent enough time on this where i need
9oSCNT7oB2g,435840,437759,to try to get this drawing where it
9oSCNT7oB2g,437759,439680,looks decent i just want to make it look
9oSCNT7oB2g,439680,441520,decent and then call it done and then i
9oSCNT7oB2g,441520,444240,can move on to the real artwork quick
9oSCNT7oB2g,444240,446160,break because this video is sponsored by

9oSCNT7oB2g,504639,506720,honey for sponsoring this video now the
9oSCNT7oB2g,506720,509440,reason i love using paint pens is
9oSCNT7oB2g,509440,511280,they're just easy to use you can get
9oSCNT7oB2g,511280,514800,clean details crisp lines easy layering
9oSCNT7oB2g,514800,517039,but i actually found these pens
9oSCNT7oB2g,517039,519200,difficult to use they didn't feel like
9oSCNT7oB2g,519200,521680,poscas at all really in fact they felt a
9oSCNT7oB2g,521680,524640,lot more like watercolor but dry i don't
9oSCNT7oB2g,524640,526240,i don't get it i don't know but i just
9oSCNT7oB2g,526240,528080,wanted to go with it so i just kind of
9oSCNT7oB2g,528080,530560,stopped comparing them to poscas at all
9oSCNT7oB2g,530560,532800,and just try to use them as they are i
9oSCNT7oB2g,532800,535040,want to love you for you and not because
9oSCNT7oB2g,535040,537200,you're similar to pasca because honestly
9oSCNT7oB2g,537200,538959,sweetie i don't think you really compare
9oSCNT7oB2g,538959,540800,things are getting quite weird in this
9oSCNT7oB2g,540800,542720,drawing i'm not using any sort of
9oSCNT7oB2g,542720,546480,reference obviously what am i doing my
9oSCNT7oB2g,546480,549200,colors have all gone completely whack
9oSCNT7oB2g,549200,551519,obviously i kind of hate it but i'm
9oSCNT7oB2g,551519,554080,continuing to sink more and more time
9oSCNT7oB2g,554080,556320,into it which is making me think that i
9oSCNT7oB2g,556320,558800,really need to salvage this this is
9oSCNT7oB2g,558800,560480,gonna be a big part of the video now i'm
9oSCNT7oB2g,560480,562000,gonna really have to hustle when i get
9oSCNT7oB2g,562000,564240,to the real artwork maybe it's because
9oSCNT7oB2g,564240,565920,they're just floating here with no
9oSCNT7oB2g,565920,567920,background i'm gonna add a nice little
9oSCNT7oB2g,567920,569600,setting it'll be good for them so i
9oSCNT7oB2g,569600,571839,started working on creating the top of
9oSCNT7oB2g,571839,574399,the cake i'm attempting to draw frosting
9oSCNT7oB2g,574399,577279,here with a very dried-out gray marker
9oSCNT7oB2g,577279,579360,that doesn't really work
9oSCNT7oB2g,579360,582080,it looks more like snow so it's looking
9oSCNT7oB2g,582080,584560,very much like a winter scene from a
9oSCNT7oB2g,584560,588240,candy land on planet nauphilophagus tell
9oSCNT7oB2g,588240,591120,me you know all about planet nafloff
9oSCNT7oB2g,591120,593839,what did i say nafolophagus yeah you
9oSCNT7oB2g,593839,596320,know it's that planet where giant
9oSCNT7oB2g,596320,599839,chaotic orbs of candy rainbows and stars
9oSCNT7oB2g,599839,601680,grow out of the ground some of them
9oSCNT7oB2g,601680,604079,wearing bow ties some of them dripping
9oSCNT7oB2g,604079,606399,also it snows i'm still under the
9oSCNT7oB2g,606399,608560,impression that i'm making a cake this
9oSCNT7oB2g,608560,610640,is cake so i went ahead and put
9oSCNT7oB2g,610640,612480,sprinkles on the cake that's what i
9oSCNT7oB2g,612480,614399,thought i was doing in reality i was
9oSCNT7oB2g,614399,617519,adding space rocks on nautholaphagus
9oSCNT7oB2g,617519,619600,i guess i'll do the sprinkle song though
9oSCNT7oB2g,619600,623400,still maybe some sort of alien remix
9oSCNT7oB2g,623400,626590,[Music]
9oSCNT7oB2g,627040,628959,yeah that was weird okay so this does
9oSCNT7oB2g,628959,631920,not look how i was envisioning in any
9oSCNT7oB2g,631920,635120,way at all but some strange part of me
9oSCNT7oB2g,635120,637200,the really strange part of me actually
9oSCNT7oB2g,637200,639600,liked this i'm almost embarrassed to say
9oSCNT7oB2g,639600,640959,but i think i really just need to take
9oSCNT7oB2g,640959,643200,it to the next level go crazy i'm
9oSCNT7oB2g,643200,645519,several hours in at this point and it's
9oSCNT7oB2g,645519,648000,becoming clear that i've chosen this the
9oSCNT7oB2g,648000,650160,real artwork that i've been waiting to
9oSCNT7oB2g,650160,653200,do doesn't exist this is the real
9oSCNT7oB2g,653200,655440,artwork are you disappointed me too i
9oSCNT7oB2g,655440,657519,might as well make it good because it's
9oSCNT7oB2g,657519,659040,clear that this is all i'm gonna have
9oSCNT7oB2g,659040,661200,time for so i'm gonna try to do
9oSCNT7oB2g,661200,662800,something cool for the background and
9oSCNT7oB2g,662800,664959,just hope and pray that this all ends up
9oSCNT7oB2g,664959,666720,okay and we can get out of this
9oSCNT7oB2g,666720,668959,nightmare eventually and this is just a
9oSCNT7oB2g,668959,671279,very quick reminder about my character
9oSCNT7oB2g,671279,673519,yearbook i introduced this and explained
9oSCNT7oB2g,673519,675760,all about it in my art room tour part
9oSCNT7oB2g,675760,677519,two for those of you who already know
9oSCNT7oB2g,677519,679279,all about this i just want to remind you
9oSCNT7oB2g,679279,681680,that the 28th of march is the last day
9oSCNT7oB2g,681680,683519,to order it which is only a couple days
9oSCNT7oB2g,683519,686000,from now so just just wanted to remind
9oSCNT7oB2g,686000,687760,you this is where it becomes very clear
9oSCNT7oB2g,687760,690480,that these markers are not great for
9oSCNT7oB2g,690480,693279,large areas i don't know if i got a bad
9oSCNT7oB2g,693279,696000,batch or something but a lot of them
9oSCNT7oB2g,696000,698399,were very dry to the point where i could
9oSCNT7oB2g,698399,700640,not even really get the color to flow i
9oSCNT7oB2g,700640,702880,mean i shook them up i gave them a rest
9oSCNT7oB2g,702880,704800,to see if that helps i did all of it
9oSCNT7oB2g,704800,706720,they were just barely working just
9oSCNT7oB2g,706720,709360,enough for me to lay down a very patchy
9oSCNT7oB2g,709360,711920,color it was mainly the lighter colors
9oSCNT7oB2g,711920,713760,it was very similar to working with like
9oSCNT7oB2g,713760,716000,a five-year-old crayola marker that you
9oSCNT7oB2g,716000,717680,dug out of the bottom of your junk
9oSCNT7oB2g,717680,719760,drawer which is somewhat disappointing
9oSCNT7oB2g,719760,721279,considering these markers are three
9oSCNT7oB2g,721279,723519,hundred dollars i feel like it's either
9oSCNT7oB2g,723519,726480,that i got a bad batch or it's just me
9oSCNT7oB2g,726480,729120,maybe i have toxic fingers obviously
9oSCNT7oB2g,729120,731360,chloe was doing just fine with these she
9oSCNT7oB2g,731360,733120,didn't seem to be having any problem
9oSCNT7oB2g,733120,737040,look at that juicy pen
9oSCNT7oB2g,737040,739279,really but of course i'm here just
9oSCNT7oB2g,739279,742079,struggling my eyes out why am i having
9oSCNT7oB2g,742079,744399,problems i'm out here making art that
9oSCNT7oB2g,744399,746240,literally makes no sense creating this
9oSCNT7oB2g,746240,748399,background was a lot of layering and
9oSCNT7oB2g,748399,750240,blending because i was combining like
9oSCNT7oB2g,750240,752480,five different pens that had no ink in
9oSCNT7oB2g,752480,755120,them and then the top was like very dark
9oSCNT7oB2g,755120,756720,colors that were really hard to blend
9oSCNT7oB2g,756720,759600,together so i spent several hours just
9oSCNT7oB2g,759600,762320,on this oh that's so embarrassing you
9oSCNT7oB2g,762320,763839,know i should probably start playing it
9oSCNT7oB2g,763839,765680,cool and not telling you that these
9oSCNT7oB2g,765680,767360,things take so long you know just be
9oSCNT7oB2g,767360,769680,like no i barely even took any time at
9oSCNT7oB2g,769680,771360,all just whipped it up real quick i
9oSCNT7oB2g,771360,773760,wasn't even trying definitely was not
9oSCNT7oB2g,773760,775600,like sweating bullets trying to make
9oSCNT7oB2g,775600,777519,something good i just pooped this out
9oSCNT7oB2g,777519,779519,basically but no that's not the truth
9oSCNT7oB2g,779519,781519,this is what my effort looks like you
9oSCNT7oB2g,781519,783279,know what this was my first time using
9oSCNT7oB2g,783279,784639,these i'm gonna chalk it up to
9oSCNT7oB2g,784639,786959,inexperience i am gonna continue to try
9oSCNT7oB2g,786959,788480,to use them and see if i can get better
9oSCNT7oB2g,788480,789920,and maybe i just need to get used to
9oSCNT7oB2g,789920,791680,them clearly i'm going for some sort of
9oSCNT7oB2g,791680,794240,galaxy look here since we have the stars
9oSCNT7oB2g,794240,796880,and weird planety things it all looks
9oSCNT7oB2g,796880,800000,very alien anyway so why not i will say
9oSCNT7oB2g,800000,802959,i really did like the precision of the
9oSCNT7oB2g,802959,804800,brush tip because sometimes the
9oSCNT7oB2g,804800,807519,chunkiness of the posca tip you know it
9oSCNT7oB2g,807519,809200,just doesn't give you that delicate
9oSCNT7oB2g,809200,810959,touch that you want once i finished with
9oSCNT7oB2g,810959,813120,the background i was left with a giant
9oSCNT7oB2g,813120,815279,mess just everywhere so i went through
9oSCNT7oB2g,815279,817040,and tried to refine everything a little
9oSCNT7oB2g,817040,819440,bit more even though i'm completely lost
9oSCNT7oB2g,819440,821040,and i have no clue what i'm drawing at
9oSCNT7oB2g,821040,822880,this point i kind of just want to make
9oSCNT7oB2g,822880,825600,it look like i do know what i'm drawing
9oSCNT7oB2g,825600,828560,and somehow after hours of fumbling my
9oSCNT7oB2g,828560,831279,way through this art i have made
9oSCNT7oB2g,831279,834160,something kind of cool right no i don't
9oSCNT7oB2g,834160,835519,know maybe i've been staring at this for
9oSCNT7oB2g,835519,837680,too long finally i went back and added a
9oSCNT7oB2g,837680,839680,bunch of stars to the galaxy which is
9oSCNT7oB2g,839680,842079,the best part of making the galaxy in my
9oSCNT7oB2g,842079,844240,opinion i did use the white karen
9oSCNT7oB2g,844240,846160,markers for this which actually did
9oSCNT7oB2g,846160,848160,surprisingly well definitely still
9oSCNT7oB2g,848160,850639,didn't turn out a super strong white but
9oSCNT7oB2g,850639,852480,i was fine with that i did bring out my
9oSCNT7oB2g,852480,854720,posca for the extra bright highlights
9oSCNT7oB2g,854720,857120,where i really want the white to pop now
9oSCNT7oB2g,857120,858639,i'm acting like this is just the
9oSCNT7oB2g,858639,861040,strangest drawing ever because i really
9oSCNT7oB2g,861040,863199,feel that it is but i showed jordan a
9oSCNT7oB2g,863199,865279,picture of it while i was editing and i
9oSCNT7oB2g,865279,867680,asked him what is this he said without
9oSCNT7oB2g,867680,870240,hesitation it's candy land and i'm like
9oSCNT7oB2g,870240,872000,okay that's simple huh you just see it
9oSCNT7oB2g,872000,873680,you know exactly what that is he didn't
9oSCNT7oB2g,873680,875279,seem the least bit confused about it
9oSCNT7oB2g,875279,877440,finally i did sign the thing shocking
9oSCNT7oB2g,877440,878880,that i was willing to put my name on
9oSCNT7oB2g,878880,881199,this this is the finished artwork to me
9oSCNT7oB2g,881199,883839,this does look very confusing sincerely
9oSCNT7oB2g,883839,885680,i feel dumb for admitting it but i
9oSCNT7oB2g,885680,887600,actually kind of like this it's very
9oSCNT7oB2g,887600,889360,different but it's kind of cool i'm not
9oSCNT7oB2g,889360,891120,sure how you're gonna feel about it i'm
9oSCNT7oB2g,891120,893680,sorry if you hate it but unfortunately
9oSCNT7oB2g,893680,895440,my time was up for this video i spent
9oSCNT7oB2g,895440,898000,way too much time on this also i do have
9oSCNT7oB2g,898000,900560,some very large projects coming up soon
9oSCNT7oB2g,900560,902320,and i really need to be careful with my
9oSCNT7oB2g,902320,904160,time for the next couple of weeks in
9oSCNT7oB2g,904160,906480,order to save enough extra time for
9oSCNT7oB2g,906480,908240,those big projects you'll see what i
9oSCNT7oB2g,908240,910000,mean soon enough because it's going to
9oSCNT7oB2g,910000,913279,be literally large until then thank you
9oSCNT7oB2g,913279,914959,so much for watching and i will see you
9oSCNT7oB2g,914959,918360,guys next week bye
