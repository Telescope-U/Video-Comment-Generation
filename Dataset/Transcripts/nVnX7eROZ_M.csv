nVnX7eROZ_M,9320,11240,How did it become
nVnX7eROZ_M,11320,15559,that the peoples from the world's oldest continuing cultures
nVnX7eROZ_M,15640,17920,are now the most imprisoned?
nVnX7eROZ_M,22800,25080,Probably been in jail about 30 years.
nVnX7eROZ_M,25760,27360,Started when I was 11.
nVnX7eROZ_M,29280,32920,"For Koori kids, if you went to court once or twice,"
nVnX7eROZ_M,33520,36560,they made you a ward of the state for being uncontrollable.
nVnX7eROZ_M,37720,40160,I struggle with my cultural identity.
nVnX7eROZ_M,40240,44000,Understanding that I have both white in me and Black.
nVnX7eROZ_M,46040,47840,"People said to me, ""How did you change?"""
nVnX7eROZ_M,47920,51839,"I said, ""Well, I dove into my problems."""
nVnX7eROZ_M,54560,56040,Been a long time.
nVnX7eROZ_M,56120,58320,-Got some paintings. -You've been painting up a storm.
nVnX7eROZ_M,58400,62160,Indigenous art created by Indigenous prisoners
nVnX7eROZ_M,62240,65720,that shows people out there we have got something good in us.
nVnX7eROZ_M,65800,68080,"-That's coming with us. -Yeah, no worries."
nVnX7eROZ_M,68160,70800,"In the gallery, that would be absolute gold."
nVnX7eROZ_M,70880,75680,Art remains oneÂ of the most purest and accessible ways
nVnX7eROZ_M,75760,78120,of our people to connect with culture.
nVnX7eROZ_M,78720,81760,"This is the type of door that art opens,"
nVnX7eROZ_M,81840,83520,"it can open, for anyone."
nVnX7eROZ_M,83600,86280,"Cash award, and it goes to Robby Wirramanda."
nVnX7eROZ_M,87360,89240,My friend
nVnX7eROZ_M,91760,94400,I want to try and get on to as much art as I can
nVnX7eROZ_M,94480,98000,because it's lit a fire of inspiration under me.
nVnX7eROZ_M,99200,101920,"Once you're put on this roundabout,"
nVnX7eROZ_M,102000,104640,"it is a very hard thing to get off of, you know?"
nVnX7eROZ_M,104720,106240,You can keep coming back.
nVnX7eROZ_M,115560,119720,"As for our incarcerated First Nations people,"
nVnX7eROZ_M,119800,123440,the journey home continues.
