qVfys-dWoKM,208511,209970,(giggling)
qVfys-dWoKM,209970,211115,- Who surprised you the most
qVfys-dWoKM,211115,213340,once you got to know them on set?

qVfys-dWoKM,229550,231515,"in an interview, in an audition."
qVfys-dWoKM,231515,233890,We don't interview (laughs).
qVfys-dWoKM,233890,236140,- I've done an air kiss in an audition
qVfys-dWoKM,236140,238440,"where in the sides it said, ""And now they kiss"""
qVfys-dWoKM,238440,241263,and I've gone (blows kiss)
qVfys-dWoKM,241263,243751,- Have you? (laughs)
qVfys-dWoKM,243751,244750,- What happened?
qVfys-dWoKM,244750,248280,"- I think they were like, ""could you try it,"

qVfys-dWoKM,255656,257430,Make it a little bit more urban.
qVfys-dWoKM,257430,260989,"- What's the most show-biz thing you've ever done,"
qVfys-dWoKM,260989,262389,or experienced?
qVfys-dWoKM,262390,264390,- Present in a BAFTA.
qVfys-dWoKM,264390,267113,"It was pretty, it felt pretty show-biz."
qVfys-dWoKM,267113,269590,"Because that was weird, just it looked like"
qVfys-dWoKM,269590,271639,"Madame Tussauds, but everyone was moving."
qVfys-dWoKM,272630,274535,"I was like, rah, this is real."
qVfys-dWoKM,274535,276780,"Like, everyone was moving."
qVfys-dWoKM,276780,278200,That was pretty exciting.
qVfys-dWoKM,278200,280985,- If you could cast yourself in any part

qVfys-dWoKM,292170,293590,"they've got mustache, no?"
qVfys-dWoKM,293590,295318,"- Well, they've got whiskers."
qVfys-dWoKM,295318,297259,"- Would you rather win an Oscar,"
qVfys-dWoKM,297260,299384,or get to travel to space?
qVfys-dWoKM,299384,301172,- Travel to space. - What?
qVfys-dWoKM,301172,303780,- An Oscar would look better on my social.
qVfys-dWoKM,303780,304757,- Oh my days.
qVfys-dWoKM,304757,309509,"- (laughing loudly) No, travel to space, travel to space."
qVfys-dWoKM,309510,311620,- Connor is not a fan. - (laughing) He's not a fan.
qVfys-dWoKM,311620,312573,- Head in hands.
qVfys-dWoKM,314030,316590,- I wouldn't even do it if it was 100% safe.
qVfys-dWoKM,316590,317423,- Really?
qVfys-dWoKM,317423,320400,(Ncuti laughs loudly)
qVfys-dWoKM,320400,321570,- What do you miss most
qVfys-dWoKM,321570,324280,when you're not on the set of Sex Ed?
qVfys-dWoKM,324280,326400,- The people. - Yeah.
qVfys-dWoKM,326400,327639,"- I see you guys now and then,"
qVfys-dWoKM,327640,329749,but a lot of most of the crew I don't see until
qVfys-dWoKM,329749,332360,"at like a screening, or people are in London,"
qVfys-dWoKM,332360,333533,or we go back to Wales.
qVfys-dWoKM,334994,337513,"- I'll be brutally honest, I didn't hear the question."
qVfys-dWoKM,337514,338613,(slight laughter)
qVfys-dWoKM,338613,341470,- Did you do any particular research for your role;
qVfys-dWoKM,341470,343380,how did you get into character?
qVfys-dWoKM,343380,346080,"- I chatted to my mom a bit because my mom's a therapist,"
qVfys-dWoKM,346080,348560,but I didn't really do anything to get into character.
qVfys-dWoKM,348561,350780,"- I guess I looked to the relationship I have with my mom,"
qVfys-dWoKM,350780,352250,and how strong that is
qVfys-dWoKM,352250,354770,and how much of an influence that has had on me
qVfys-dWoKM,354770,355800,"I guess, as I've grown up."
qVfys-dWoKM,355800,359319,- What's the best and worst parts about your jobs as actors?
qVfys-dWoKM,359320,361317,- Best part of acting I think is meeting people
qVfys-dWoKM,361317,363159,who you'd never get to meet
qVfys-dWoKM,363160,365970,and kind of form friendships and relationships.
qVfys-dWoKM,365970,367340,Worst part of acting.
qVfys-dWoKM,367340,369060,- I think what you said before about the fact
qVfys-dWoKM,369060,370040,"you know, you get to meet people and stuff."
qVfys-dWoKM,370040,372640,"I think for me, that what happens after"
qVfys-dWoKM,372640,374420,you have to then just say bye to those people
qVfys-dWoKM,374420,375470,"that you form this thing with,"
qVfys-dWoKM,375470,377030,that you'll never actually get again.
qVfys-dWoKM,377030,379097,- So you're saying that the best and worst part about it
qVfys-dWoKM,379097,379930,is the same thing?
qVfys-dWoKM,379930,381220,- I find it.
qVfys-dWoKM,381220,382760,"- You've got the wettest meals,"
qVfys-dWoKM,382760,384710,have you just got soups?
qVfys-dWoKM,384710,386449,- Thanks for watching. - Thanks for watching.
qVfys-dWoKM,386450,387623,- Thanks for watching.
