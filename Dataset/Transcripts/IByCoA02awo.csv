IByCoA02awo,2480,16920,I am a very nostalgic person.
IByCoA02awo,39600,44839,oh my god that is so Singapore! even  the coffee cup has a scam warning haha!
IByCoA02awo,66640,71600,"it's rice noodles and really good  broth, with like spare parts from  "
IByCoA02awo,71600,85840,"the pig, you know, the skin… there's  intestines, bunch of different parts…"
IByCoA02awo,125840,129440,i've been an East side kid for most of my life.  
IByCoA02awo,129440,134560,"i really like the neighborhood, it's very chill.  it's very close to east coast park and the sea  "
IByCoA02awo,135200,140400,so there's always trees and birds  and just this really relaxed vibe.
IByCoA02awo,140400,156840,So we overheard somebody pronouncing  Paris Baguette as Paris bak kut teh…
IByCoA02awo,157840,161920,"In a singapore that looks  increasingly unrecognisable to me,  "
IByCoA02awo,163040,169840,revisiting all these mementos from my  growing up years fills me with comfort.
IByCoA02awo,172880,178720,Every meal and snack you see in this video  was shared with someone close to my heart.  
IByCoA02awo,179680,185280,Old friends. My frigging huge extended  family. My most precious parents.
IByCoA02awo,186480,192720,"Over bowls of char siew noodles and  papaya bee Hoon soup and curry fish head,  "
IByCoA02awo,192720,197840,we catch up with each other’s  lives over the last 2-3 years.
IByCoA02awo,201440,208320,"Perspective is a funny thing. Bali  is my spiritual home. When I’m there,  "
IByCoA02awo,208880,215760,I’m often so happy that I simply wish that time  wd just stand still so I could freeze frame  
IByCoA02awo,216640,222240,life in that moment. How perfect it all feels.
IByCoA02awo,223280,231360,"When I’m here, immersed in all these wonderful  warm cosy feelings of kinships and friendships,  "
IByCoA02awo,231360,234240,"I wish that time also would stand still,  "
IByCoA02awo,234960,240080,because I wouldn’t want to ever  lose any one of these people.
IByCoA02awo,241920,247360,People assume that because I have left Singapore  and found my happiness and truth elsewhere  
IByCoA02awo,247360,253280,that I do not value my ties here. That I  abandoned everything as easily as how one  
IByCoA02awo,253280,257440,shrugs off a sweater when exiting a cold  as hell Singaporean airconed office.
IByCoA02awo,258000,266240,The truth is in fact the opposite. I left because  I couldn’t find a way to live here n live with  
IByCoA02awo,266240,275280,myself. I envy everyone who’s pretty happy rolling  along in SG w the status quo. I never found a way  
IByCoA02awo,275280,281840,to do that successfully n still be at peace  w myself. N the price for finding that peace  
IByCoA02awo,282640,287600,"outside, somewhere else, is that I don’t get to  be with all the friends and family whom I love  "
IByCoA02awo,287600,293760,and cherish. I don’t get to enjoy as much  time with them as I could have otherwise.
IByCoA02awo,294800,300319,There’s an irreplaceable flavour to being  with people who have known u n your family  
IByCoA02awo,300320,302640,as far back as memory stretches.  
IByCoA02awo,303840,310320,Friends who have shared the joys and tears  of growing up and growing older together.
IByCoA02awo,310320,314400,This kind of kinship and friendship  is yet another one of those things  
IByCoA02awo,315360,324240,"money can’t buy. Time, health, the  relationships that really matter."
IByCoA02awo,327440,331200,Asian people don’t say sappy stuff  like I love you to one another.
IByCoA02awo,332160,338560,Food is how Asian families express love. We  eat. and we eat good meals together to enjoy  
IByCoA02awo,338560,345200,that moment of commune and togetherness and  joy in savouring good flavours on the tongue.
IByCoA02awo,346080,352319,"So the talk is mostly banal. Who married  who, who got a new job, who had a baby."
IByCoA02awo,352320,354000,Nothing too real or intimate.
IByCoA02awo,354720,356960,But What I really want to say  
IByCoA02awo,356960,363919,to all my people over all these meals  over these last 3 weeks is this:
IByCoA02awo,365760,371600,It’s so good to be here with you  right now. It’s so good to see you.  
IByCoA02awo,373120,377360,I’m so glad you’re happy and  healthy and everyone’s doing well.
IByCoA02awo,379280,380639,Thank you for not forgetting me.
IByCoA02awo,381840,387120,Thank you for all your grace  towards me. Even though you don’t  
IByCoA02awo,387120,392639,"understand my choices in life, even though  what I do is so alien in concept to you,  "
IByCoA02awo,393760,400960,"thank you for not judging, thanks for just  accepting that it makes me happy, n showing  "
IByCoA02awo,400960,407840,me that it’s good enough that we just spend some  time together. N you’re happy that I’m happy.
IByCoA02awo,408880,415280,Thank you for making me feel so very loved. I love  you all so much. I wish I can be spend more time  
IByCoA02awo,415280,422080,with you all. But I’m also so incredibly happy to  see that we are all living our life’s as best as  
IByCoA02awo,422080,428319,"we can in parallel, from the young guns to the old  feisty ones in our family and our friends circle."
IByCoA02awo,430080,436000,I can't bring myself to say this when we  are face to face directly across the table  
IByCoA02awo,436000,449840,but that's truly what i want to say to all of you
