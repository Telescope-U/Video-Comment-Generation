9CctXZt0_Vw,70840,72640,carsandbids.com
9CctXZt0_Vw,72640,75920,so let's talk range rover sport this
9CctXZt0_Vw,75920,78159,first came out more than 15 years ago as
9CctXZt0_Vw,78159,80320,a smaller more affordable alternative to
9CctXZt0_Vw,80320,82799,the full-size range rover in the years
9CctXZt0_Vw,82799,84960,since this has become a tremendously
9CctXZt0_Vw,84960,88159,popular vehicle and now this is the new
9CctXZt0_Vw,88159,90640,one the third generation model which is
9CctXZt0_Vw,90640,93360,coming out just after a fully redesigned
9CctXZt0_Vw,93360,95840,new version of the full-size range rover
9CctXZt0_Vw,95840,97840,which i showed off in a thorough video
9CctXZt0_Vw,97840,100159,tour a few months ago the new range
9CctXZt0_Vw,100159,102320,rover sport is just being revealed for
9CctXZt0_Vw,102320,104560,the first time right now and in fact it
9CctXZt0_Vw,104560,106640,was just showing to the world for the
9CctXZt0_Vw,106640,109360,very first time shortly before i filmed
9CctXZt0_Vw,109360,112720,this video so i can't drive it just yet
9CctXZt0_Vw,112720,115280,but i can take you on a thorough tour of
9CctXZt0_Vw,115280,117520,the new range rover sport and show you
9CctXZt0_Vw,117520,120399,some of its quirks and features so let's
9CctXZt0_Vw,120399,123719,get started
9CctXZt0_Vw,129520,131360,all right i'm going to start the quirks
9CctXZt0_Vw,131360,133520,and features the new range rover sport
9CctXZt0_Vw,133520,135120,with a quick look at the different
9CctXZt0_Vw,135120,136800,versions available the lineup is
9CctXZt0_Vw,136800,138720,actually pretty simple and it starts off
9CctXZt0_Vw,138720,142400,with a base model called the p360s
9CctXZt0_Vw,142400,145120,that has about 355 horsepower from a
9CctXZt0_Vw,145120,147280,turbocharged six-cylinder and it starts
9CctXZt0_Vw,147280,150560,around 83 000. now that's a big price
9CctXZt0_Vw,150560,152400,increase compared to the outgoing range
9CctXZt0_Vw,152400,154160,rover sport base model which started
9CctXZt0_Vw,154160,156560,around 10 000 cheaper but land rover
9CctXZt0_Vw,156560,158959,tells me that the new base model sport
9CctXZt0_Vw,158959,161120,is equipped to actually around the mid
9CctXZt0_Vw,161120,163200,level of the outgoing range rover sport
9CctXZt0_Vw,163200,164160,and so
9CctXZt0_Vw,164160,166160,this price increase isn't as significant
9CctXZt0_Vw,166160,168000,as you might think once you factor in
9CctXZt0_Vw,168000,169920,the additional equipment and of course
9CctXZt0_Vw,169920,171599,other updates and changes for the new
9CctXZt0_Vw,171599,174160,model now the next version is the p400
9CctXZt0_Vw,174160,176319,model which uses the same powertrain as
9CctXZt0_Vw,176319,177680,the base model except with a little
9CctXZt0_Vw,177680,180560,extra horsepower around 395 and that
9CctXZt0_Vw,180560,183040,starts around 90 thousand dollars but
9CctXZt0_Vw,183040,184800,more interesting than those first two
9CctXZt0_Vw,184800,186400,models in the range is the next one
9CctXZt0_Vw,186400,188280,which is called the
9CctXZt0_Vw,188280,189920,p440e
9CctXZt0_Vw,189920,193680,autobiography it's 440e for electric
9CctXZt0_Vw,193680,196640,because that is a plug-in hybrid model
9CctXZt0_Vw,196640,199200,it can travel for around 50 miles on
9CctXZt0_Vw,199200,200879,fully electric power before switching
9CctXZt0_Vw,200879,202720,over to the gasoline engine
9CctXZt0_Vw,202720,204799,interestingly this is the only way you
9CctXZt0_Vw,204799,206959,can get the autobiography in the range
9CctXZt0_Vw,206959,209120,rover sport lineup if you get the
9CctXZt0_Vw,209120,211280,plug-in hybrid version that's the only
9CctXZt0_Vw,211280,212720,way they're offering it this time around
9CctXZt0_Vw,212720,214400,which is interesting now that version
9CctXZt0_Vw,214400,218080,has 435 horsepower to zero to 60 in 5.5
9CctXZt0_Vw,218080,221280,seconds and it starts around 104 000
9CctXZt0_Vw,221280,222959,which is pretty good and land rover
9CctXZt0_Vw,222959,224640,tells me that it's capable of fast
9CctXZt0_Vw,224640,226159,charging to the point where it can fully
9CctXZt0_Vw,226159,228720,recharge its roughly 50 mile range in
9CctXZt0_Vw,228720,231040,about 40 minutes which is pretty quick
9CctXZt0_Vw,231040,233280,now the top-end model at the pinnacle of
9CctXZt0_Vw,233280,235840,the range rover sport and model range is
9CctXZt0_Vw,235840,239040,this one the p530 which is the first
9CctXZt0_Vw,239040,241920,edition and it's offered with a turbo v8
9CctXZt0_Vw,241920,243840,this is the only way that you can get
9CctXZt0_Vw,243840,246239,the v8 at least for the first model year
9CctXZt0_Vw,246239,248959,in the first edition model and it has an
9CctXZt0_Vw,248959,250360,amazing
9CctXZt0_Vw,250360,253439,525 horsepower pretty strong and it'll
9CctXZt0_Vw,253439,256079,lose 0-60 in the mid 4 second range so
9CctXZt0_Vw,256079,258880,it is a serious performer and a very
9CctXZt0_Vw,258880,260560,fast vehicle starting price for this one
9CctXZt0_Vw,260560,263360,will be around 121 500
9CctXZt0_Vw,263360,265520,so it gets pretty pricey but you get a
9CctXZt0_Vw,265520,267120,lot in terms of performance and
9CctXZt0_Vw,267120,268720,equipment which i'll show you now
9CctXZt0_Vw,268720,270880,although that's the model line for now i
9CctXZt0_Vw,270880,272080,suspect things are going to change in
9CctXZt0_Vw,272080,273680,the coming years for instance like i
9CctXZt0_Vw,273680,275919,said the v8 is only offered in the first
9CctXZt0_Vw,275919,278240,edition model for 23 but i suspect it
9CctXZt0_Vw,278240,280240,will expand to other trim levels in
9CctXZt0_Vw,280240,282000,future model years when there will be no
9CctXZt0_Vw,282000,284240,first edition anymore also worth
9CctXZt0_Vw,284240,286479,pointing out landover says a full
9CctXZt0_Vw,286479,288080,electric version of the new range of
9CctXZt0_Vw,288080,289840,sport is on the way for calendar year
9CctXZt0_Vw,289840,293600,2024 no other details horsepower range
9CctXZt0_Vw,293600,295199,that sort of thing hasn't yet been
9CctXZt0_Vw,295199,297040,announced but maybe two years from now
9CctXZt0_Vw,297040,298639,we're gonna see a fully electric new
9CctXZt0_Vw,298639,300479,range rover which makes sense because
9CctXZt0_Vw,300479,302080,that's kind of the trend in this
9CctXZt0_Vw,302080,304080,industry but anyway next up let's talk
9CctXZt0_Vw,304080,305680,about the outside of the new range rover
9CctXZt0_Vw,305680,307759,sport which has what land rover calls
9CctXZt0_Vw,307759,310639,its reductive design language or you and
9CctXZt0_Vw,310639,312800,i would think of as minimalist but
9CctXZt0_Vw,312800,315840,basically it's simple it's without major
9CctXZt0_Vw,315840,319280,frills or adornments or crazy scoops and
9CctXZt0_Vw,319280,321280,hoops like a lot of other cars are
9CctXZt0_Vw,321280,323120,starting to gravitate toward land rover
9CctXZt0_Vw,323120,325199,has instead decided to kind of keep it
9CctXZt0_Vw,325199,326720,simple and basic and there are several
9CctXZt0_Vw,326720,328160,ways you can tell that on the outside of
9CctXZt0_Vw,328160,329919,this car one is the door handles which
9CctXZt0_Vw,329919,332080,are flush into the body when the car is
9CctXZt0_Vw,332080,334000,locked that's becoming kind of a common
9CctXZt0_Vw,334000,335600,trend in the industry but one thing that
9CctXZt0_Vw,335600,338160,isn't common is the grill it's actually
9CctXZt0_Vw,338160,340400,smaller than previous models that's a
9CctXZt0_Vw,340400,341919,big deal because everybody else is
9CctXZt0_Vw,341919,343680,getting bigger and bigger with their
9CctXZt0_Vw,343680,346720,grills the new lexus lx 570 grill could
9CctXZt0_Vw,346720,348720,eat a small family this thing is
9CctXZt0_Vw,348720,350160,actually getting
9CctXZt0_Vw,350160,352720,smaller more minimalist more reductive
9CctXZt0_Vw,352720,354400,on the outside and probably the most
9CctXZt0_Vw,354400,356000,noticeable place where you see that and
9CctXZt0_Vw,356000,357360,the most notable change compared to the
9CctXZt0_Vw,357360,359360,outgoing model is with the tail light so
9CctXZt0_Vw,359360,361440,you can see they're small thin
9CctXZt0_Vw,361440,363280,horizontal and mounted on this single
9CctXZt0_Vw,363280,365600,band going across the back of the car
9CctXZt0_Vw,365600,368560,not much fussiness or craziness or weird
9CctXZt0_Vw,368560,371039,tail light design back here very simple
9CctXZt0_Vw,371039,373759,and indeed very reductive just like land
9CctXZt0_Vw,373759,375919,rover says also worth pointing out you
9CctXZt0_Vw,375919,377680,have kind of a cool line on the side of
9CctXZt0_Vw,377680,378960,this car and that would be where the
9CctXZt0_Vw,378960,381680,windows meet the doors there's no real
9CctXZt0_Vw,381680,383440,seam here usually you have weather
9CctXZt0_Vw,383440,386000,stripping or some chrome trim but in
9CctXZt0_Vw,386000,388080,this car they just kind of meet almost
9CctXZt0_Vw,388080,390319,like you'd see in a concept car
9CctXZt0_Vw,390319,391600,something that shouldn't make production
9CctXZt0_Vw,391600,393840,there should be something there some
9CctXZt0_Vw,393840,396639,protective material or trim but not here
9CctXZt0_Vw,396639,398080,it's all about kind of reducing the
9CctXZt0_Vw,398080,399759,noise and keeping it minimal on the
9CctXZt0_Vw,399759,402479,outside with that said as i talk about
9CctXZt0_Vw,402479,405120,reductive design language and minimalism
9CctXZt0_Vw,405120,408080,this vehicle has 23-inch wheels they are
9CctXZt0_Vw,408080,411280,massive 23s they are standard on the
9CctXZt0_Vw,411280,414240,first edition model which this is big
9CctXZt0_Vw,414240,416960,giant wheels so not everything has been
9CctXZt0_Vw,416960,419520,reduced on the outside of this car but
9CctXZt0_Vw,419520,421280,anyway next we move inside the range
9CctXZt0_Vw,421280,423680,rover sport where you will also see the
9CctXZt0_Vw,423680,425840,reductive design language in here the
9CctXZt0_Vw,425840,428319,minimalism that you saw outside is also
9CctXZt0_Vw,428319,429599,brought into the interior and it's
9CctXZt0_Vw,429599,432240,fairly calm and simple in here although
9CctXZt0_Vw,432240,434000,much like the wheels on the outside you
9CctXZt0_Vw,434000,436160,do have some large eye-catching elements
9CctXZt0_Vw,436160,438080,in here and specifically i'm referring
9CctXZt0_Vw,438080,440319,to screens the center screen is
9CctXZt0_Vw,440319,442560,especially interesting and cool this is
9CctXZt0_Vw,442560,445520,a giant 13-inch curved
9CctXZt0_Vw,445520,448479,center touchscreen which looks very neat
9CctXZt0_Vw,448479,450400,and is kind of neat in the center of
9CctXZt0_Vw,450400,452720,this interior now this screen uses
9CctXZt0_Vw,452720,454479,basically the same infotainment system
9CctXZt0_Vw,454479,455680,that land rover's been using in its
9CctXZt0_Vw,455680,457440,vehicles for a couple of years now
9CctXZt0_Vw,457440,459440,although larger than before i have this
9CctXZt0_Vw,459440,461199,same system in my new landover defender
9CctXZt0_Vw,461199,463599,2020 model with a much smaller screen
9CctXZt0_Vw,463599,465520,this one gets larger and of course
9CctXZt0_Vw,465520,468479,curved and it certainly looks cooler it
9CctXZt0_Vw,468479,470879,also has a couple of cool features to it
9CctXZt0_Vw,470879,473440,one is the water forting depth
9CctXZt0_Vw,473440,474879,measurement system which is really neat
9CctXZt0_Vw,474879,476400,there are some sensors on the outside of
9CctXZt0_Vw,476400,479199,the car that can actually sense how much
9CctXZt0_Vw,479199,481919,water you have forded and let you know
9CctXZt0_Vw,481919,484080,how close you are to the maximum this
9CctXZt0_Vw,484080,486160,car can take this vehicle can ford
9CctXZt0_Vw,486160,489840,almost 36 inches of water almost three
9CctXZt0_Vw,489840,492319,feet and when you go into a puddle or a
9CctXZt0_Vw,492319,494319,river or a lake it'll actually tell you
9CctXZt0_Vw,494319,496400,how much of that water fording you've
9CctXZt0_Vw,496400,498160,done whether you should stop and turn
9CctXZt0_Vw,498160,500160,around another cool thing in this center
9CctXZt0_Vw,500160,503280,screen the cabin air filter will show
9CctXZt0_Vw,503280,506080,you exactly how much crap it's filtering
9CctXZt0_Vw,506080,508319,out of the air which is kind of crazy it
9CctXZt0_Vw,508319,511280,has a diagram that'll show like the bad
9CctXZt0_Vw,511280,512959,stuff and then what actually gets
9CctXZt0_Vw,512959,515039,through into the interior so if you want
9CctXZt0_Vw,515039,516880,while you're driving along you can
9CctXZt0_Vw,516880,518880,follow along with just how clean your
9CctXZt0_Vw,518880,521760,air is inside your range rover sport
9CctXZt0_Vw,521760,523760,interior but that's the center
9CctXZt0_Vw,523760,525680,infotainment display and i can't fully
9CctXZt0_Vw,525680,527040,show it to you it's in display mode it's
9CctXZt0_Vw,527040,529360,a pre-production model but i will
9CctXZt0_Vw,529360,531440,completely show you all of its quirks
9CctXZt0_Vw,531440,533120,and features when i finally get access
9CctXZt0_Vw,533120,534640,to one of these that i can drive and
9CctXZt0_Vw,534640,536800,check out in addition to that center
9CctXZt0_Vw,536800,538560,infotainment screen there's also another
9CctXZt0_Vw,538560,540480,large screen in here the gauge cluster
9CctXZt0_Vw,540480,543920,screen 13.7 inches and tremendously
9CctXZt0_Vw,543920,546320,configurable again similar technology to
9CctXZt0_Vw,546320,548320,what's used in other land rover models
9CctXZt0_Vw,548320,549680,and you could play with it and make
9CctXZt0_Vw,549680,551600,certain screens larger and smaller and
9CctXZt0_Vw,551600,553519,kind of prioritize what you want in this
9CctXZt0_Vw,553519,555600,screen this is one of my very favorite
9CctXZt0_Vw,555600,557440,gauge cluster screen setups in the
9CctXZt0_Vw,557440,559680,entire car industry very configurable
9CctXZt0_Vw,559680,561920,very personalizable to show you exactly
9CctXZt0_Vw,561920,564000,what it is you want to see directly in
9CctXZt0_Vw,564000,565680,your line of sight which is cool but
9CctXZt0_Vw,565680,568000,otherwise aside from those big screens
9CctXZt0_Vw,568000,570560,in this interior really is reductive and
9CctXZt0_Vw,570560,572240,minimalist in here and there are several
9CctXZt0_Vw,572240,574320,great examples of that one is the
9CctXZt0_Vw,574320,576000,climate vents which don't have like a
9CctXZt0_Vw,576000,577680,prominent position on the dashboard like
9CctXZt0_Vw,577680,579680,in so many cars instead they're hidden
9CctXZt0_Vw,579680,581680,in this horizontal black line that
9CctXZt0_Vw,581680,583519,separates the dashboard so you don't
9CctXZt0_Vw,583519,585120,really see their presence there another
9CctXZt0_Vw,585120,587440,good example of the reductive interior
9CctXZt0_Vw,587440,590080,here is the climate controls themselves
9CctXZt0_Vw,590080,593279,which are primarily organized into these
9CctXZt0_Vw,593279,596160,two dials they do most basic climate
9CctXZt0_Vw,596160,598160,control functions if you push these
9CctXZt0_Vw,598160,600480,dials in you can adjust the heated or
9CctXZt0_Vw,600480,602640,cooled seats turn one way for heated and
9CctXZt0_Vw,602640,604079,another way for cool if you pull the
9CctXZt0_Vw,604079,605839,dials out you can adjust like the fan
9CctXZt0_Vw,605839,607680,speed or the placement of the air and if
9CctXZt0_Vw,607680,608959,you don't have them pushed in or pulled
9CctXZt0_Vw,608959,610720,out you can adjust the air temperature
9CctXZt0_Vw,610720,613279,using these dials so all of your basic
9CctXZt0_Vw,613279,615360,climate control functions are used in
9CctXZt0_Vw,615360,618240,these center dials and everything else
9CctXZt0_Vw,618240,619760,has been moved to the screen and
9CctXZt0_Vw,619760,622640,eliminated to make it more reductive in
9CctXZt0_Vw,622640,625120,this interior and another example of a
9CctXZt0_Vw,625120,627120,simplistic minimalist touch in here the
9CctXZt0_Vw,627120,629200,wireless charging pad it's not sticking
9CctXZt0_Vw,629200,630640,out in the center like it is in some
9CctXZt0_Vw,630640,633519,cars instead it's hidden underneath the
9CctXZt0_Vw,633519,635200,center infotainment screen you wouldn't
9CctXZt0_Vw,635200,637120,really know it's there but it's in a
9CctXZt0_Vw,637120,638959,useful spot where you can stick your
9CctXZt0_Vw,638959,641279,phone and have it charge and speaking of
9CctXZt0_Vw,641279,643600,minimalist reductive touches in here
9CctXZt0_Vw,643600,645519,another good example is the seat
9CctXZt0_Vw,645519,647279,controls you can see them here mounted
9CctXZt0_Vw,647279,649760,on the door not only are they simple and
9CctXZt0_Vw,649760,651760,clear and purpose but the controls
9CctXZt0_Vw,651760,654240,themselves incorporate the seat memory
9CctXZt0_Vw,654240,656079,button so you don't have like one bank
9CctXZt0_Vw,656079,657680,of buttons for the seat controls and
9CctXZt0_Vw,657680,659120,then another bank for the memory it's
9CctXZt0_Vw,659120,661519,all incorporated into these rather sleek
9CctXZt0_Vw,661519,664560,controls and these seats can operate up
9CctXZt0_Vw,664560,668240,to 22 different ways which is insane but
9CctXZt0_Vw,668240,669600,you can see the seat controls don't have
9CctXZt0_Vw,669600,671120,that much movement well that's because
9CctXZt0_Vw,671120,672720,when you go to move the seat controls
9CctXZt0_Vw,672720,674880,you start moving them and then the rest
9CctXZt0_Vw,674880,676560,of the controls appear on the center
9CctXZt0_Vw,676560,679040,screen for the lesser used items that
9CctXZt0_Vw,679040,680560,you're not going to be changing all that
9CctXZt0_Vw,680560,682240,often so that keeps a lot of major
9CctXZt0_Vw,682240,683839,controls off the door panel and kind of
9CctXZt0_Vw,683839,685920,declutters this interior
9CctXZt0_Vw,685920,688079,minimalism and next up another nice
9CctXZt0_Vw,688079,690079,touch in this car the center console has
9CctXZt0_Vw,690079,692480,been moved up compared to prior range
9CctXZt0_Vw,692480,694160,rover sport models and that means that
9CctXZt0_Vw,694160,696560,it's closer to you for an arm rest or to
9CctXZt0_Vw,696560,698399,access the center console you open it up
9CctXZt0_Vw,698399,699920,and you can see it's actually a cool
9CctXZt0_Vw,699920,701920,center console that will keep your
9CctXZt0_Vw,701920,703360,sandwich or your drink or your
9CctXZt0_Vw,703360,705040,chocolates cool while you're driving
9CctXZt0_Vw,705040,707279,along now this center console being
9CctXZt0_Vw,707279,709040,higher up means that you don't really
9CctXZt0_Vw,709040,711600,need an actual fold down armrest anymore
9CctXZt0_Vw,711600,714399,but this car still has it the full down
9CctXZt0_Vw,714399,716800,range rover armrest with a little twirly
9CctXZt0_Vw,716800,719040,spinny thing at the end like range
9CctXZt0_Vw,719040,721200,rovers have had since the dawn of time
9CctXZt0_Vw,721200,722560,land rover told me they kept that in
9CctXZt0_Vw,722560,724720,there in part just for heritage because
9CctXZt0_Vw,724720,726639,you don't really need it anymore but
9CctXZt0_Vw,726639,728800,since it's become such a thing in range
9CctXZt0_Vw,728800,731360,rovers it's still here in this one and
9CctXZt0_Vw,731360,733040,another upgrade to the interior comes to
9CctXZt0_Vw,733040,734480,the seats landover told me they are
9CctXZt0_Vw,734480,736639,considerably more heavily bolstered than
9CctXZt0_Vw,736639,738480,the prior range over sport which
9CctXZt0_Vw,738480,741040,obviously adds comfort and luxury in
9CctXZt0_Vw,741040,743760,here and speaking of the seats a couple
9CctXZt0_Vw,743760,745279,important touches worth noting for one
9CctXZt0_Vw,745279,748000,thing the headrests are winged which
9CctXZt0_Vw,748000,750480,apparently means that the edges kind of
9CctXZt0_Vw,750480,752880,curl in whichever direction you want for
9CctXZt0_Vw,752880,754639,more head support while you're sitting
9CctXZt0_Vw,754639,757440,in the seat again adding luxury a very
9CctXZt0_Vw,757440,760000,nice luxurious touch in here also
9CctXZt0_Vw,760000,762160,notable with the seats this particular
9CctXZt0_Vw,762160,764320,range rover sport this high spec first
9CctXZt0_Vw,764320,768079,edition model comes with a 29 speaker
9CctXZt0_Vw,768079,770959,meridian sound system and that includes
9CctXZt0_Vw,770959,773440,speakers in the headrests and not just
9CctXZt0_Vw,773440,774800,in the front headrest which i've seen on
9CctXZt0_Vw,774800,777120,a few other luxury vehicles in all the
9CctXZt0_Vw,777120,779680,headrests front and rear there are
9CctXZt0_Vw,779680,781040,speakers in the headrest for a
9CctXZt0_Vw,781040,783920,personalized listening experience also
9CctXZt0_Vw,783920,785360,worth noting about the speakers in this
9CctXZt0_Vw,785360,787279,car obviously 29 of them they're hidden
9CctXZt0_Vw,787279,789120,all throughout the vehicle and that
9CctXZt0_Vw,789120,790720,includes on the door panel you can see
9CctXZt0_Vw,790720,792639,an upper speaker a lower speaker but
9CctXZt0_Vw,792639,795200,there's also one behind this fabric and
9CctXZt0_Vw,795200,798639,land rover calls this acoustic enhancing
9CctXZt0_Vw,798639,801040,fabric and they told me this fabric
9CctXZt0_Vw,801040,802560,works kind of in conjunction with the
9CctXZt0_Vw,802560,804800,audio system i guess to enhance the
9CctXZt0_Vw,804800,807279,acoustics and it's right there in the
9CctXZt0_Vw,807279,809200,door panel kind of an odd looking fabric
9CctXZt0_Vw,809200,811600,but it has a purpose and speaking of
9CctXZt0_Vw,811600,813279,items in the door panel worth pointing
9CctXZt0_Vw,813279,815760,out how about this trim here this is
9CctXZt0_Vw,815760,817920,forged carbon fiber it's intended
9CctXZt0_Vw,817920,820560,obviously to look cool which makes sense
9CctXZt0_Vw,820560,822480,because this is the v8 powered first
9CctXZt0_Vw,822480,824560,edition it's a sporty model and so it
9CctXZt0_Vw,824560,826959,has some cool looking carbon fiber trim
9CctXZt0_Vw,826959,829120,to go along with the interior and next
9CctXZt0_Vw,829120,830480,up we move on to the back seat of the
9CctXZt0_Vw,830480,831839,new range rover sport one of the things
9CctXZt0_Vw,831839,833279,you'll notice compared to the outgoing
9CctXZt0_Vw,833279,835519,model back here is it's a little roomier
9CctXZt0_Vw,835519,837360,than before land rover told me new range
9CctXZt0_Vw,837360,839279,rover sport is about two and a half
9CctXZt0_Vw,839279,841680,inches longer than the outgoing model
9CctXZt0_Vw,841680,843680,and that translates to more interior
9CctXZt0_Vw,843680,845360,space they said a little less than an
9CctXZt0_Vw,845360,847680,inch more legroom up front and a little
9CctXZt0_Vw,847680,850000,less than an inch more legroom in back
9CctXZt0_Vw,850000,852320,so there's more legroom more knee room
9CctXZt0_Vw,852320,854959,both front and rear and land rover also
9CctXZt0_Vw,854959,857199,said the new range rover sport is taller
9CctXZt0_Vw,857199,859040,by about an inch than the outgoing model
9CctXZt0_Vw,859040,861360,and wider by about an inch compared to
9CctXZt0_Vw,861360,863040,the outgoing version and so that
9CctXZt0_Vw,863040,865120,generally means a little bit more
9CctXZt0_Vw,865120,868480,interior space in all areas now with
9CctXZt0_Vw,868480,870240,that said even though there's more room
9CctXZt0_Vw,870240,871680,in this new ranger sport than the
9CctXZt0_Vw,871680,874240,outgoing model there's no more third row
9CctXZt0_Vw,874240,876240,seat the prior generation range rover
9CctXZt0_Vw,876240,878480,sport offered a third row and the
9CctXZt0_Vw,878480,880959,full-size range rover did not but for
9CctXZt0_Vw,880959,883440,the new versions of both of these models
9CctXZt0_Vw,883440,885120,the range rover will be offering the
9CctXZt0_Vw,885120,887519,third row seat and the range rover sport
9CctXZt0_Vw,887519,889680,will not land rover told me they've
9CctXZt0_Vw,889680,892320,transitioned the third row into the
9CctXZt0_Vw,892320,894560,full-size range rover my guess is they
9CctXZt0_Vw,894560,897040,figured if people wanted a three-row
9CctXZt0_Vw,897040,898959,range rover that wanted to make them pay
9CctXZt0_Vw,898959,900560,more for the full-size model and that
9CctXZt0_Vw,900560,901760,makes sense it was always kind of
9CctXZt0_Vw,901760,903760,cramped in the range rover sport anyway
9CctXZt0_Vw,903760,905440,the lineup makes a little bit more sense
9CctXZt0_Vw,905440,907360,in this configuration but it is worth
9CctXZt0_Vw,907360,909120,pointing out that all this extra room in
9CctXZt0_Vw,909120,910399,the back seat does make it more
9CctXZt0_Vw,910399,913680,comfortable as does the power backrest
9CctXZt0_Vw,913680,915440,you can press this little seat control
9CctXZt0_Vw,915440,917440,here and push the backrest forward or
9CctXZt0_Vw,917440,919440,backward automatically which is a cool
9CctXZt0_Vw,919440,921600,luxury touch back here also a cool
9CctXZt0_Vw,921600,924560,luxury touch back here a lighted seat
9CctXZt0_Vw,924560,926560,belt buckle you can see it here and it's
9CctXZt0_Vw,926560,928800,a cool idea it's night time it's dark
9CctXZt0_Vw,928800,930240,you're fumbling around trying to figure
9CctXZt0_Vw,930240,932079,out where your belt buckle is and buckle
9CctXZt0_Vw,932079,934399,your seatbelt well it's lighted to make
9CctXZt0_Vw,934399,936160,that process easier starting to see this
9CctXZt0_Vw,936160,938160,in more and more luxury vehicles and
9CctXZt0_Vw,938160,940399,it's neat to have the range rover sport
9CctXZt0_Vw,940399,942480,has it and next up we move on to the
9CctXZt0_Vw,942480,944240,cargo area in the new range rover sport
9CctXZt0_Vw,944240,946320,where you will find some rather
9CctXZt0_Vw,946320,949040,interesting quirks one of which is that
9CctXZt0_Vw,949040,950639,underneath the cargo floor in this
9CctXZt0_Vw,950639,953600,particular model is a full-size spare
9CctXZt0_Vw,953600,957519,tire a 23-inch wheel and a full-size
9CctXZt0_Vw,957519,959440,spare tire landover tells me this is an
9CctXZt0_Vw,959440,961759,option it is absolutely huge as you can
9CctXZt0_Vw,961759,964240,see takes up the entire floor underneath
9CctXZt0_Vw,964240,965920,the cargo area i can't imagine anyone
9CctXZt0_Vw,965920,967519,will actually order this but just in
9CctXZt0_Vw,967519,970720,case you feel like you need a full size
9CctXZt0_Vw,970720,974000,23 inch spare here it is an extra wheel
9CctXZt0_Vw,974000,976560,and tire your range over sport that you
9CctXZt0_Vw,976560,978480,can order now also worth noting in the
9CctXZt0_Vw,978480,980800,cargo area that's interesting back here
9CctXZt0_Vw,980800,983120,is this partition you can see it lifts
9CctXZt0_Vw,983120,985440,up here and there's like a panel then
9CctXZt0_Vw,985440,988000,dividing the cargo area and this way if
9CctXZt0_Vw,988000,989600,you have like two separate items you
9CctXZt0_Vw,989600,991680,don't want them to mix like a bowling
9CctXZt0_Vw,991680,994720,ball and some wine bottle you can do the
9CctXZt0_Vw,994720,996560,partition keep it in place and then
9CctXZt0_Vw,996560,998320,stuff won't roll around and hit each
9CctXZt0_Vw,998320,1000399,other and it's kind of a neat idea you
9CctXZt0_Vw,1000399,1002959,also have on the wall of this partition
9CctXZt0_Vw,1002959,1005199,these little straps here that can keep
9CctXZt0_Vw,1005199,1007279,valuable fragile items completely
9CctXZt0_Vw,1007279,1009040,secured so when you're driving along
9CctXZt0_Vw,1009040,1011040,they won't roll around to just smash and
9CctXZt0_Vw,1011040,1012880,break which is a neat idea and these
9CctXZt0_Vw,1012880,1014560,little pieces along the straps can
9CctXZt0_Vw,1014560,1017199,actually move to make the strap areas
9CctXZt0_Vw,1017199,1019839,larger or smaller depending on exactly
9CctXZt0_Vw,1019839,1021680,what it is you're carrying which is also
9CctXZt0_Vw,1021680,1023920,cool now one thing that this feature
9CctXZt0_Vw,1023920,1026880,cannot do is come out to become a bench
9CctXZt0_Vw,1026880,1028720,off the tailgate like it does in the
9CctXZt0_Vw,1028720,1030240,full-size range rover the reason for
9CctXZt0_Vw,1030240,1032160,that is this the range rover sport
9CctXZt0_Vw,1032160,1034319,doesn't have a split tailgate with part
9CctXZt0_Vw,1034319,1036798,that folds down that you can sit on so
9CctXZt0_Vw,1036798,1039280,it doesn't have that feature but you can
9CctXZt0_Vw,1039280,1041360,sit on this frankly as you can see the
9CctXZt0_Vw,1041360,1043038,floor underneath this partition is
9CctXZt0_Vw,1043038,1044720,rubber so even if you're dirty you're
9CctXZt0_Vw,1044720,1046640,coming out of the mud or the ocean you
9CctXZt0_Vw,1046640,1048079,just went swimming i don't know you want
9CctXZt0_Vw,1048079,1049919,to sit in your tailgate your cargo area
9CctXZt0_Vw,1049919,1051520,you can do that and you won't get the
9CctXZt0_Vw,1051520,1053520,back here dirty so there is kind of a
9CctXZt0_Vw,1053520,1055520,seat back here just not quite the same
9CctXZt0_Vw,1055520,1057200,level of usefulness as the full-size
9CctXZt0_Vw,1057200,1058880,range rover also worth noting back here
9CctXZt0_Vw,1058880,1060320,you see some little buttons over on the
9CctXZt0_Vw,1060320,1061760,side of the cargo area of course those
9CctXZt0_Vw,1061760,1063520,are your fold down rear seats so you
9CctXZt0_Vw,1063520,1065280,press those buttons and the rear seats
9CctXZt0_Vw,1065280,1066720,will fold down automatically so you
9CctXZt0_Vw,1066720,1069280,don't have to do any latches or straps
9CctXZt0_Vw,1069280,1072320,like a plebian would in a normal suv but
9CctXZt0_Vw,1072320,1074480,anyway on to some other interesting
9CctXZt0_Vw,1074480,1076400,items on the outside of the new range
9CctXZt0_Vw,1076400,1078960,rover sport specifically in back you can
9CctXZt0_Vw,1078960,1081600,see quad exhaust back here and that's
9CctXZt0_Vw,1081600,1084240,because this is the v8 powered first
9CctXZt0_Vw,1084240,1086000,edition model the quad exhausts are only
9CctXZt0_Vw,1086000,1088320,on the v8 and they're a nice signature
9CctXZt0_Vw,1088320,1090559,of the fact that this is the v8 model
9CctXZt0_Vw,1090559,1092559,and in fact those quad exhausts might
9CctXZt0_Vw,1092559,1094160,come in handy identifying this because
9CctXZt0_Vw,1094160,1095600,you'll notice there's no badging back
9CctXZt0_Vw,1095600,1097840,here again minimalism they wanted to
9CctXZt0_Vw,1097840,1099760,keep things simple and so it doesn't say
9CctXZt0_Vw,1099760,1101840,v8 it doesn't say first edition it
9CctXZt0_Vw,1101840,1103840,doesn't tell you which trim it is what
9CctXZt0_Vw,1103840,1105679,engine it is how much it costs it just
9CctXZt0_Vw,1105679,1108080,says range over sport and the rest
9CctXZt0_Vw,1108080,1109760,you'll have to figure out and those quad
9CctXZt0_Vw,1109760,1112080,exhausts do a decent job giving it away
9CctXZt0_Vw,1112080,1113760,and next up a few other interesting
9CctXZt0_Vw,1113760,1115440,quirks and features worth pointing out
9CctXZt0_Vw,1115440,1117280,the new range rover sport for one thing
9CctXZt0_Vw,1117280,1120000,air suspension is standard on all models
9CctXZt0_Vw,1120000,1122559,both to enhance the ride quality and to
9CctXZt0_Vw,1122559,1125120,give it the ability to lift up or lower
9CctXZt0_Vw,1125120,1126880,down depending on exactly what you want
9CctXZt0_Vw,1126880,1128080,to do raise up when you're going
9CctXZt0_Vw,1128080,1130720,off-road and lower for easier access and
9CctXZt0_Vw,1130720,1132480,ride height that's some of the benefits
9CctXZt0_Vw,1132480,1134240,of air suspension now speaking of
9CctXZt0_Vw,1134240,1136000,off-roading another cool feature offered
9CctXZt0_Vw,1136000,1137919,by the new range rover sport is an
9CctXZt0_Vw,1137919,1140799,adaptive off-road cruise control system
9CctXZt0_Vw,1140799,1143520,landover says this is a world first and
9CctXZt0_Vw,1143520,1145120,it's debuting in this model even the
9CctXZt0_Vw,1145120,1146960,full-size range rover doesn't offer this
9CctXZt0_Vw,1146960,1148960,feature yet there are four different
9CctXZt0_Vw,1148960,1151280,like modes you can choose of adaptive
9CctXZt0_Vw,1151280,1153760,crews based on your comfort level you
9CctXZt0_Vw,1153760,1156000,select your off-road adaptive cruise
9CctXZt0_Vw,1156000,1158320,mode and then the car will do it for you
9CctXZt0_Vw,1158320,1160240,climb a hill go down a mountain rock
9CctXZt0_Vw,1160240,1163280,crawl whatever all in adaptive cruise
9CctXZt0_Vw,1163280,1166080,control but off-road which is a pretty
9CctXZt0_Vw,1166080,1167840,cool feature and when you're doing that
9CctXZt0_Vw,1167840,1170240,adaptive off-road cruise controlling all
9CctXZt0_Vw,1170240,1171600,you will be doing as the driver is
9CctXZt0_Vw,1171600,1173200,steering the car really will take care
9CctXZt0_Vw,1173200,1174880,of the rest and
9CctXZt0_Vw,1174880,1176559,speaking of steering worth pointing out
9CctXZt0_Vw,1176559,1178640,the new range rover sport offers four
9CctXZt0_Vw,1178640,1180320,wheel steering for the first time the
9CctXZt0_Vw,1180320,1182559,rear wheels will turn a little bit if
9CctXZt0_Vw,1182559,1184240,you're at low speeds and you crank the
9CctXZt0_Vw,1184240,1186080,wheel the rear wheels will turn in the
9CctXZt0_Vw,1186080,1188000,opposite direction to help decrease your
9CctXZt0_Vw,1188000,1189919,turning circle and make it steer a
9CctXZt0_Vw,1189919,1191360,little bit quicker if you're making a
9CctXZt0_Vw,1191360,1193600,u-turn or in a tight parking lot or
9CctXZt0_Vw,1193600,1195280,parking space but if you're going at
9CctXZt0_Vw,1195280,1197039,higher speeds then the rear wheels will
9CctXZt0_Vw,1197039,1198880,turn in the same direction as the front
9CctXZt0_Vw,1198880,1200000,wheels like if you're trying to make a
9CctXZt0_Vw,1200000,1202159,lane change to help expedite that
9CctXZt0_Vw,1202159,1203520,process and give you sort of a more
9CctXZt0_Vw,1203520,1205600,stable feel on the road that's a pretty
9CctXZt0_Vw,1205600,1207039,cool feature for wheel steering seeing
9CctXZt0_Vw,1207039,1208640,it in more and more luxury vehicles and
9CctXZt0_Vw,1208640,1210640,for the range rover sport it is only
9CctXZt0_Vw,1210640,1214159,offered on the stormer handling pack
9CctXZt0_Vw,1214159,1216480,which interestingly is standard on the
9CctXZt0_Vw,1216480,1218720,first edition model that's this one and
9CctXZt0_Vw,1218720,1221039,not available on the other so all first
9CctXZt0_Vw,1221039,1222720,edition models will come with this four
9CctXZt0_Vw,1222720,1224799,wheel steering system but you can't get
9CctXZt0_Vw,1224799,1226880,it on other range rover sport models at
9CctXZt0_Vw,1226880,1229120,least yet i suspect it's going to be
9CctXZt0_Vw,1229120,1230480,available throughout the lineup
9CctXZt0_Vw,1230480,1233039,relatively soon but for now it's only on
9CctXZt0_Vw,1233039,1234480,the first edition and by the way
9CctXZt0_Vw,1234480,1236640,speaking of that stormer handling pack
9CctXZt0_Vw,1236640,1238159,it's not just four-wheel steering that
9CctXZt0_Vw,1238159,1240240,it includes but also some other benefits
9CctXZt0_Vw,1240240,1242080,like torque vectoring which will break
9CctXZt0_Vw,1242080,1244159,the inside wheel in a corner to help
9CctXZt0_Vw,1244159,1246559,steer better and some other benefits to
9CctXZt0_Vw,1246559,1248080,increase your handling again the first
9CctXZt0_Vw,1248080,1250080,edition is the only model with the v8
9CctXZt0_Vw,1250080,1251360,and it's supposed to be the sporty
9CctXZt0_Vw,1251360,1253200,exciting one in the lineup so it makes
9CctXZt0_Vw,1253200,1255520,sense that it has that stormer handling
9CctXZt0_Vw,1255520,1258159,pack and again this is only for 23 this
9CctXZt0_Vw,1258159,1260320,first edition model i suspect the rest
9CctXZt0_Vw,1260320,1261520,of the good stuff will eventually
9CctXZt0_Vw,1261520,1263520,trickle down to the other versions but
9CctXZt0_Vw,1263520,1265520,for now the first edition is the one you
9CctXZt0_Vw,1265520,1268080,want especially if you want a sporty
9CctXZt0_Vw,1268080,1270559,powerful and v8 powered range rover
9CctXZt0_Vw,1270559,1272720,sport and so
9CctXZt0_Vw,1272720,1275679,there's a full preview a thorough tour
9CctXZt0_Vw,1275679,1278880,of the new redesigned range rover sport
9CctXZt0_Vw,1278880,1281840,and some of its quirks and features this
9CctXZt0_Vw,1281840,1284080,looks like a very compelling vehicle
9CctXZt0_Vw,1284080,1286720,beautiful styling new technology and
9CctXZt0_Vw,1286720,1288640,some excellent powertrains and i can't
9CctXZt0_Vw,1288640,1290559,wait to get behind the wheel and drive
9CctXZt0_Vw,1290559,1294840,it sometime in the next few months
9CctXZt0_Vw,1294840,1298570,[Music]
