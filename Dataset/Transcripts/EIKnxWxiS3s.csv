EIKnxWxiS3s,61440,63039,weeks for those who are also wondering
EIKnxWxiS3s,63039,65040,when the setup makeover series is going
EIKnxWxiS3s,65040,66560,to be coming back i'm definitely trying
EIKnxWxiS3s,66560,68320,to bring it back sometime soon but as i
EIKnxWxiS3s,68320,70560,mentioned before the issue is to do with
EIKnxWxiS3s,70560,73040,inventory whether it's furniture or tech
EIKnxWxiS3s,73040,74640,it just took way too long to get the
EIKnxWxiS3s,74640,75920,products in and for the person we're
EIKnxWxiS3s,75920,77680,doing the makeover for it would take
EIKnxWxiS3s,77680,79119,like three to four months start to
EIKnxWxiS3s,79119,80720,finish which just didn't really make
EIKnxWxiS3s,80720,82080,sense for anyone so i'm definitely
EIKnxWxiS3s,82080,83600,planning to bring that series back
EIKnxWxiS3s,83600,85439,because it was so popular but i am also
EIKnxWxiS3s,85439,86880,thinking of doing like a virtual setup
EIKnxWxiS3s,86880,88320,makeover series where you guys can go
EIKnxWxiS3s,88320,89759,ahead and send me a picture of your
EIKnxWxiS3s,89759,91439,setup as well as all of your dream
EIKnxWxiS3s,91439,93200,products and i'll put together like a
EIKnxWxiS3s,93200,95439,specific design and product list as well
EIKnxWxiS3s,95439,97439,as a realistic rendering just to help
EIKnxWxiS3s,97439,99280,you visualize your dream setup and to
EIKnxWxiS3s,99280,101439,allow everyone to gain some inspiration
EIKnxWxiS3s,101439,103520,from the whole like case study process
EIKnxWxiS3s,103520,104960,as always all the products are going to
EIKnxWxiS3s,104960,106399,be linked down below but let's just go
EIKnxWxiS3s,106399,108159,ahead and get started with the first
EIKnxWxiS3s,108159,109680,accessory so one of the newest
EIKnxWxiS3s,109680,111840,accessories to my home desk setup is the
EIKnxWxiS3s,111840,114479,benq screen bar halo there are a lot of
EIKnxWxiS3s,114479,115759,different screen bars out there that
EIKnxWxiS3s,115759,118000,mount on the monitor provide ambient or
EIKnxWxiS3s,118000,119680,offset lighting and a lot of them come
EIKnxWxiS3s,119680,121280,in at a lot cheaper price point than
EIKnxWxiS3s,121280,123200,this i believe this right here is about
EIKnxWxiS3s,123200,125520,180 dollars and they're able to get the
EIKnxWxiS3s,125520,127920,job done but for my own personal desk
EIKnxWxiS3s,127920,129599,setup i definitely wanted to go ahead
EIKnxWxiS3s,129599,131440,and check out the best and the reason
EIKnxWxiS3s,131440,133680,why i need this is because i'm actually
EIKnxWxiS3s,133680,135440,in the master bedroom of my condo and
EIKnxWxiS3s,135440,137360,there are no additional lights in the
EIKnxWxiS3s,137360,138959,ceiling and it's just concrete and
EIKnxWxiS3s,138959,140160,you're meant to have like different
EIKnxWxiS3s,140160,142160,lamps even though i do have like a lamp
EIKnxWxiS3s,142160,144319,in this room it just isn't enough light
EIKnxWxiS3s,144319,146080,when i'm working at night and so i can't
EIKnxWxiS3s,146080,147520,really see what's going on on the
EIKnxWxiS3s,147520,150080,keyboard or on the color grading panel
EIKnxWxiS3s,150080,151840,so having like a light like this is just
EIKnxWxiS3s,151840,153760,able to like offset that and illuminate
EIKnxWxiS3s,153760,155680,the entire workspace but some of the
EIKnxWxiS3s,155680,157440,unique features that you have right here
EIKnxWxiS3s,157440,159840,is the brightness control as well as the
EIKnxWxiS3s,159840,161840,temperature control there's also a
EIKnxWxiS3s,161840,163599,sensor that is built in and it also
EIKnxWxiS3s,163599,165599,lights up on the front and back while
EIKnxWxiS3s,165599,167360,ensuring that the light doesn't reflect
EIKnxWxiS3s,167360,169680,back onto your monitor or display it
EIKnxWxiS3s,169680,171599,works on all sorts of monitors it clips
EIKnxWxiS3s,171599,173360,on the top very easily and i would say
EIKnxWxiS3s,173360,174959,it's kind of a trade-off of something
EIKnxWxiS3s,174959,176959,that is very functional um while on the
EIKnxWxiS3s,176959,179840,look side is as good as it can look but
EIKnxWxiS3s,179840,181680,i wouldn't say it's like aesthetically
EIKnxWxiS3s,181680,183680,pleasing but they've made it as seamless
EIKnxWxiS3s,183680,185840,as possible this wireless controller
EIKnxWxiS3s,185840,187440,puck though with all the features i just
EIKnxWxiS3s,187440,189680,mentioned is really nice so i can just
EIKnxWxiS3s,189680,191760,like sit it down it's angled perfectly
EIKnxWxiS3s,191760,193680,made out of metal the mechanics and
EIKnxWxiS3s,193680,195920,everything are nice and i just go ahead
EIKnxWxiS3s,195920,198000,and touch this and it will turn on the
EIKnxWxiS3s,198000,199920,light i can just adjust the brightness
EIKnxWxiS3s,199920,202159,the temp have it in the auto mode as i
EIKnxWxiS3s,202159,204560,mentioned and typically i have it set to
EIKnxWxiS3s,204560,206480,like a very like cool function probably
EIKnxWxiS3s,206480,209200,around like a 5500 kelvin range just
EIKnxWxiS3s,209200,211360,because i have to reference the display
EIKnxWxiS3s,211360,213680,when i'm color grading as accurately as
EIKnxWxiS3s,213680,215360,possible so by having that offset
EIKnxWxiS3s,215360,216799,lighting it at least reduces a bit of
EIKnxWxiS3s,216799,218480,the direct eye screen that i might get
EIKnxWxiS3s,218480,221360,from these very bright xdr displays it
EIKnxWxiS3s,221360,223280,is powered via usb-a so just plug it
EIKnxWxiS3s,223280,224799,into the back of your computer but i
EIKnxWxiS3s,224799,226239,would have liked to have seen that cable
EIKnxWxiS3s,226239,229680,been usb-c because we are in 2022. so
EIKnxWxiS3s,229680,231040,another accessory that i can definitely
EIKnxWxiS3s,231040,232560,recommend for anyone who is looking to
EIKnxWxiS3s,232560,234560,like spice up or improve their entire
EIKnxWxiS3s,234560,237360,home office or desk setup is an ambient
EIKnxWxiS3s,237360,239360,light and there's many options out there
EIKnxWxiS3s,239360,240879,including ones that are like the
EIKnxWxiS3s,240879,243200,vertical strips there's also the hue
EIKnxWxiS3s,243200,244640,play that is just like the light bar
EIKnxWxiS3s,244640,246480,that can go on the back of a monitor but
EIKnxWxiS3s,246480,248159,one that is able to give you like a
EIKnxWxiS3s,248159,250319,widespread ambience is this right here
EIKnxWxiS3s,250319,252720,and that is like an ambient pod it has
EIKnxWxiS3s,252720,254799,the white settings as well as the rgb
EIKnxWxiS3s,254799,256479,settings that you can control all within
EIKnxWxiS3s,256479,258239,like the philips hue network from your
EIKnxWxiS3s,258239,260160,smartphone but the best part about it is
EIKnxWxiS3s,260160,261600,that you can use it in many different
EIKnxWxiS3s,261600,263360,ways one way that i use it when i'm
EIKnxWxiS3s,263360,265600,doing like color grading at night is as
EIKnxWxiS3s,265600,267520,like offset lighting instead of just
EIKnxWxiS3s,267520,269759,having like a fully pitched black room
EIKnxWxiS3s,269759,271120,which definitely causes quite a bit of
EIKnxWxiS3s,271120,273040,eye screen i like to have like an offset
EIKnxWxiS3s,273040,275440,light that just bounces off the wall at
EIKnxWxiS3s,275440,277759,like a very cool white temperature just
EIKnxWxiS3s,277759,279840,to kind of even out the whole room at
EIKnxWxiS3s,279840,281199,the same time if you want to kind of set
EIKnxWxiS3s,281199,283440,a vibe you can turn it to like an orange
EIKnxWxiS3s,283440,285759,a blue or red all the different colors
EIKnxWxiS3s,285759,287919,on the rgb spectrum so for anyone's like
EIKnxWxiS3s,287919,290320,familiar with the philips hue network or
EIKnxWxiS3s,290320,292400,already has existing hue products this
EIKnxWxiS3s,292400,294880,is like a very good addition and this
EIKnxWxiS3s,294880,297199,form factor right here specifically is
EIKnxWxiS3s,297199,298880,good for anyone who has like their desk
EIKnxWxiS3s,298880,300320,up against the wall where you can just
EIKnxWxiS3s,300320,301840,kind of put it behind the monitor and
EIKnxWxiS3s,301840,303600,it's just completely invisible and gives
EIKnxWxiS3s,303600,306479,off a very wide bloom it's about 520
EIKnxWxiS3s,306479,308320,lumens and i've been seeing it on sale
EIKnxWxiS3s,308320,310000,quite recently so for those who love
EIKnxWxiS3s,310000,312000,having like a coffee and tea at their
EIKnxWxiS3s,312000,315120,desk this accessory is the ember mug ii
EIKnxWxiS3s,315120,316479,it's a product that's been around for
EIKnxWxiS3s,316479,317840,quite a while and i've wanted to check
EIKnxWxiS3s,317840,319680,it out but i felt like the price was a
EIKnxWxiS3s,319680,321680,bit on the expensive side so i recently
EIKnxWxiS3s,321680,324080,found one like on a pretty good discount
EIKnxWxiS3s,324080,326000,and so i decided to pick it up and i
EIKnxWxiS3s,326000,327440,could see why it is one of the most
EIKnxWxiS3s,327440,329360,popular options out there if you guys
EIKnxWxiS3s,329360,331039,have seen in our budget tech episode
EIKnxWxiS3s,331039,332639,we've actually featured like a coaster
EIKnxWxiS3s,332639,335120,warmer that was like 15 but there was
EIKnxWxiS3s,335120,336639,definitely a few flaws beyond its
EIKnxWxiS3s,336639,338800,fundamentals but the ember mug 2 has a
EIKnxWxiS3s,338800,341600,few very smart features first off the
EIKnxWxiS3s,341600,344000,mug itself actually has a battery built
EIKnxWxiS3s,344000,345600,in and with a 10 ounce cup you can
EIKnxWxiS3s,345600,347280,actually keep your drink warm with the
EIKnxWxiS3s,347280,350000,battery built in alone for about an hour
EIKnxWxiS3s,350000,351600,and a half as soon as you place it on
EIKnxWxiS3s,351600,352960,the coaster though it is able to keep
EIKnxWxiS3s,352960,355759,your drink between 120 and 145
EIKnxWxiS3s,355759,357840,fahrenheit and you just go ahead and set
EIKnxWxiS3s,357840,359840,that function on the app itself whether
EIKnxWxiS3s,359840,361520,or not it's worth its hefty price tag
EIKnxWxiS3s,361520,363680,that is totally up to you but people
EIKnxWxiS3s,363680,365360,spend a lot of money on coffee so if
EIKnxWxiS3s,365360,366880,you're making your coffee at home and
EIKnxWxiS3s,366880,368240,want to be able to keep it warm while
EIKnxWxiS3s,368240,369520,you're on a conference call if you're
EIKnxWxiS3s,369520,371680,like me who gets distracted very easily
EIKnxWxiS3s,371680,373360,and just like abandons the coffee for
EIKnxWxiS3s,373360,375440,quite a few hours then this is probably
EIKnxWxiS3s,375440,377039,an accessory that you might want to look
EIKnxWxiS3s,377039,378479,into so when it comes like a great
EIKnxWxiS3s,378479,380080,productivity keyboard and mouse it is
EIKnxWxiS3s,380080,381840,also really suitable for creators out
EIKnxWxiS3s,381840,383600,there one that i've been using recently
EIKnxWxiS3s,383600,385440,is hp and i want to give a huge thanks
EIKnxWxiS3s,385440,387120,to them for sponsoring this video so
EIKnxWxiS3s,387120,389840,starting with the hp 975 dual mode
EIKnxWxiS3s,389840,391520,wireless keyboard that has a really
EIKnxWxiS3s,391520,393919,sleek and minimal design but at the same
EIKnxWxiS3s,393919,396080,time has a lot of excellent features
EIKnxWxiS3s,396080,398160,that i'm sure creatives out there value
EIKnxWxiS3s,398160,399919,and personally are ones that i've been
EIKnxWxiS3s,399919,401520,waiting for in like an all-in-one
EIKnxWxiS3s,401520,403039,package when it comes to doing like
EIKnxWxiS3s,403039,405360,video editing general admin work and
EIKnxWxiS3s,405360,407360,also a little bit of accounting so when
EIKnxWxiS3s,407360,408880,it comes to connectivity you can connect
EIKnxWxiS3s,408880,410720,up to three devices with two on
EIKnxWxiS3s,410720,414000,bluetooth and one via 2.4 gigahertz usb
EIKnxWxiS3s,414000,415759,which a lot of times is actually what i
EIKnxWxiS3s,415759,417919,prefer on my everyday setup just to
EIKnxWxiS3s,417919,420080,ensure the maximum amount of reliability
EIKnxWxiS3s,420080,421520,and when it comes like the actual typing
EIKnxWxiS3s,421520,423520,experience i found that the keys all had
EIKnxWxiS3s,423520,425520,perfect spacing and nice weight to it
EIKnxWxiS3s,425520,426960,and as someone who usually uses like the
EIKnxWxiS3s,426960,429120,first party keyboard it also has a lot
EIKnxWxiS3s,429120,430960,of important features outside of the
EIKnxWxiS3s,430960,433520,comfort including the backlit keyboard
EIKnxWxiS3s,433520,435919,aspects i edit a lot at night and not
EIKnxWxiS3s,435919,438319,having a backlight keyboard is a deal
EIKnxWxiS3s,438319,440080,breaker for me and with the ambient
EIKnxWxiS3s,440080,442479,sensing it is able to adjust accordingly
EIKnxWxiS3s,442479,444160,and giving you the maximum battery life
EIKnxWxiS3s,444160,445520,possible while also adjusting the
EIKnxWxiS3s,445520,447360,brightness based on the scenario the
EIKnxWxiS3s,447360,449360,battery life also lasts up to six months
EIKnxWxiS3s,449360,451919,and recharges via usb type-c and there
EIKnxWxiS3s,451919,453680,is also a software that is available on
EIKnxWxiS3s,453680,455680,windows and mac that allows you to go
EIKnxWxiS3s,455680,458639,ahead and customize up to 20 different
EIKnxWxiS3s,458639,461039,keys and shortcuts of your most used
EIKnxWxiS3s,461039,464319,apps on the hp ac to be able to change
EIKnxWxiS3s,464319,465919,like the different backlit features or
EIKnxWxiS3s,465919,467919,also be able to quickly access the apps
EIKnxWxiS3s,467919,469680,and commands that you use the most
EIKnxWxiS3s,469680,470720,there's also a button right here that
EIKnxWxiS3s,470720,472319,allows you to lock your computer with
EIKnxWxiS3s,472319,474400,just the press of a button when it comes
EIKnxWxiS3s,474400,476879,to the hp 935 creator mouse i find that
EIKnxWxiS3s,476879,478800,the ergonomics are nice the design is
EIKnxWxiS3s,478800,481039,very minimal and goes with the keyboard
EIKnxWxiS3s,481039,482400,and on top of that there are seven
EIKnxWxiS3s,482400,484319,programmable buttons and a hyper fast
EIKnxWxiS3s,484319,486000,scrolling wheel with a button right here
EIKnxWxiS3s,486000,487280,that allows you to also adjust your

EIKnxWxiS3s,506400,508319,hp i'm going to drop a link down below
EIKnxWxiS3s,508319,509759,and a huge thanks to them once again for
EIKnxWxiS3s,509759,511520,sponsoring this video so there are
EIKnxWxiS3s,511520,512959,definitely a few key accessories that
EIKnxWxiS3s,512959,514640,you should pick up for your desk setup
EIKnxWxiS3s,514640,517440,in 2022 just to give it some new life
EIKnxWxiS3s,517440,519039,but also make like a huge improvement
EIKnxWxiS3s,519039,521039,without breaking the bank and one of
EIKnxWxiS3s,521039,523919,which is picking up a desk mat i feel
EIKnxWxiS3s,523919,525279,like it's almost like getting a new
EIKnxWxiS3s,525279,526959,wallpaper for your smartphone it just
EIKnxWxiS3s,526959,528800,gives it a whole new life and you can
EIKnxWxiS3s,528800,530720,pick options that are 200 for like
EIKnxWxiS3s,530720,532399,genuine leather and there has been a
EIKnxWxiS3s,532399,534080,market of that out there but there are
EIKnxWxiS3s,534080,536240,also great options for desk mats that
EIKnxWxiS3s,536240,538640,are either five dollars ten to fifteen
EIKnxWxiS3s,538640,540880,dollars and also thirty dollars and in
EIKnxWxiS3s,540880,542959,fact the one that i have right here and
EIKnxWxiS3s,542959,545040,that you've seen on all my desk setups
EIKnxWxiS3s,545040,547200,is from ikea it comes in at a price of
EIKnxWxiS3s,547200,549760,like 25 i believe and it has like this
EIKnxWxiS3s,549760,551600,leather material that has like a bit of
EIKnxWxiS3s,551600,553519,a flap here if you want to put some
EIKnxWxiS3s,553519,555440,notes and store some stuff underneath it
EIKnxWxiS3s,555440,556959,but it also has like surrounding
EIKnxWxiS3s,556959,559360,stitching metal backing and all this
EIKnxWxiS3s,559360,560800,kind of comes together to bring you like
EIKnxWxiS3s,560800,563040,a very durable desk mat but there's also
EIKnxWxiS3s,563040,564720,a bit of a lip on the front just to
EIKnxWxiS3s,564720,566800,ensure it doesn't slide around all over
EIKnxWxiS3s,566800,568720,the place another must-have though not
EIKnxWxiS3s,568720,570800,only for your desk setup is releasable
EIKnxWxiS3s,570800,573120,cable ties in the past i've definitely
EIKnxWxiS3s,573120,575519,been set on like locking in my entire
EIKnxWxiS3s,575519,577360,desk setup and like permanently
EIKnxWxiS3s,577360,579200,attaching everything but as someone who
EIKnxWxiS3s,579200,581279,loves tech and constantly changes up the
EIKnxWxiS3s,581279,583440,entire setup it's important to be able
EIKnxWxiS3s,583440,585839,to be adaptive and change whenever you
EIKnxWxiS3s,585839,587680,need to and having to take out cables
EIKnxWxiS3s,587680,589120,from a permanent setup where you have to
EIKnxWxiS3s,589120,591200,like cut the zip tie is super annoying
EIKnxWxiS3s,591200,593600,so these releasable ones are able to
EIKnxWxiS3s,593600,595519,give you the strength of a typical zip
EIKnxWxiS3s,595519,597279,tie but you can just press the tab at
EIKnxWxiS3s,597279,599839,the top and just take them out and retie
EIKnxWxiS3s,599839,601440,them at any time whether you need to
EIKnxWxiS3s,601440,604079,tighten loosen or modify your setup
EIKnxWxiS3s,604079,605600,another accessory that's been around for
EIKnxWxiS3s,605600,607839,a very long time now is the blue lounge
EIKnxWxiS3s,607839,610320,sumo and on the topic of cables this is
EIKnxWxiS3s,610320,611680,one that i think you can add to your
EIKnxWxiS3s,611680,614079,desk at a relatively affordable price
EIKnxWxiS3s,614079,615920,and it uses a great material called
EIKnxWxiS3s,615920,618480,microsuction which is like a semi
EIKnxWxiS3s,618480,620880,permanent but not really permanent type
EIKnxWxiS3s,620880,622880,of adhesive that is able to sit on your
EIKnxWxiS3s,622880,625120,desk and hold your cables effectively
EIKnxWxiS3s,625120,626720,but at the same time if you want to take
EIKnxWxiS3s,626720,628959,it off you can do so without any damage
EIKnxWxiS3s,628959,630560,the concept is simple it's a weighted
EIKnxWxiS3s,630560,632079,piece that you just put on your desk
EIKnxWxiS3s,632079,633680,loop two cables through there and if you
EIKnxWxiS3s,633680,636079,have like an iphone cable or like a hard
EIKnxWxiS3s,636079,637680,drive cable then you can ensure that it
EIKnxWxiS3s,637680,639680,doesn't always slide off the end one of
EIKnxWxiS3s,639680,640720,the other biggest issues that i
EIKnxWxiS3s,640720,642640,experience with like my home office desk
EIKnxWxiS3s,642640,645279,setup and computer is just how much dust
EIKnxWxiS3s,645279,647120,is everywhere and especially with like a
EIKnxWxiS3s,647120,649440,black desk mat and like keyboard i can
EIKnxWxiS3s,649440,651440,really see that dust piling up even
EIKnxWxiS3s,651440,654399,after a few days of like not cleaning it
EIKnxWxiS3s,654399,656720,and so there are a few different options
EIKnxWxiS3s,656720,658399,one you could just vacuum the other
EIKnxWxiS3s,658399,660000,options to get like compressed air cans
EIKnxWxiS3s,660000,661360,that are very popular for cleaning
EIKnxWxiS3s,661360,663040,computers but the thing is those are
EIKnxWxiS3s,663040,665120,pretty expensive and they don't last
EIKnxWxiS3s,665120,666720,very long i feel like i use it a few
EIKnxWxiS3s,666720,668560,times for videos and i need to go and
EIKnxWxiS3s,668560,670320,buy a new one and so i actually found
EIKnxWxiS3s,670320,672839,this product recently and it is a
EIKnxWxiS3s,672839,675120,rechargeable compressed air can it
EIKnxWxiS3s,675120,676480,doesn't have like a compressed air can
EIKnxWxiS3s,676480,678079,element but essentially it's just like a
EIKnxWxiS3s,678079,680880,fan you plug it in via usb to charge it
EIKnxWxiS3s,680880,682399,and if you need like dust off your desk
EIKnxWxiS3s,682399,685279,or your computer just like
EIKnxWxiS3s,685279,687519,go like that
EIKnxWxiS3s,687519,689920,sweep it and you're good to go so yeah
EIKnxWxiS3s,689920,691519,for someone who like manages a lot of
EIKnxWxiS3s,691519,693360,tech and films them all the time but
EIKnxWxiS3s,693360,695200,also just wants to like maintain my desk
EIKnxWxiS3s,695200,697680,setup this has been a great find another
EIKnxWxiS3s,697680,698959,great accessory that you should have
EIKnxWxiS3s,698959,700320,around your desk is a good screen
EIKnxWxiS3s,700320,702399,cleaner and i find that i don't really
EIKnxWxiS3s,702399,704480,have to use this like too often but it
EIKnxWxiS3s,704480,705920,is still important because there are
EIKnxWxiS3s,705920,707519,things that don't come off with a quick
EIKnxWxiS3s,707519,710079,dust screen cleaners can really vary in
EIKnxWxiS3s,710079,711839,price point there are cheap ones more
EIKnxWxiS3s,711839,713360,expensive ones but this one right here i
EIKnxWxiS3s,713360,715360,find is kind of in the middle and it's
EIKnxWxiS3s,715360,717040,actually what apple uses in their own
EIKnxWxiS3s,717040,718639,apple store so i used it on my pro
EIKnxWxiS3s,718639,721200,display xdr the nice oled tvs that i
EIKnxWxiS3s,721200,723360,want to be very careful with but it does
EIKnxWxiS3s,723360,725600,a very good job it comes in small and
EIKnxWxiS3s,725600,727200,large sizes but this small one right
EIKnxWxiS3s,727200,730160,here has actually lasted many months and
EIKnxWxiS3s,730160,732399,it also comes with a small cloth so yeah
EIKnxWxiS3s,732399,734000,it's really self-explanatory but in
EIKnxWxiS3s,734000,736240,terms of keeping my desk clean having
EIKnxWxiS3s,736240,739040,the air compressor as well as this is
EIKnxWxiS3s,739040,740800,able to do that job this right here is
EIKnxWxiS3s,740800,743440,the sandisk pro dock so for like any
EIKnxWxiS3s,743440,744959,creators out there this is one of these
EIKnxWxiS3s,744959,747360,accessories where as soon as you see it
EIKnxWxiS3s,747360,748959,you almost feel like you've got to have
EIKnxWxiS3s,748959,750399,it and that was definitely the case with
EIKnxWxiS3s,750399,751920,me because for example our current
EIKnxWxiS3s,751920,754240,workflow right now includes recording on
EIKnxWxiS3s,754240,757440,like a sony fx3 sometimes a canon as
EIKnxWxiS3s,757440,760240,well as like a red komodo and the red
EIKnxWxiS3s,760240,762720,raptor and that consists of multiple
EIKnxWxiS3s,762720,765680,different card systems including sd cf
EIKnxWxiS3s,765680,768480,express cfast and it just gets a little
EIKnxWxiS3s,768480,770399,bit overwhelming of having to change all
EIKnxWxiS3s,770399,772240,different like card readers making sure
EIKnxWxiS3s,772240,774240,you have the maximum speed so this is
EIKnxWxiS3s,774240,776560,like the ultimate all-in-one card reader
EIKnxWxiS3s,776560,778320,that also gives you additional ports and
EIKnxWxiS3s,778320,780480,power supply that really cleans up your
EIKnxWxiS3s,780480,782320,entire desk setup but also ensures
EIKnxWxiS3s,782320,784320,you're getting that maximum speed thanks
EIKnxWxiS3s,784320,786560,to thunderbolt 3. the best part about it
EIKnxWxiS3s,786560,788240,is that you can actually pick exactly
EIKnxWxiS3s,788240,789680,what type of setup that you would like
EIKnxWxiS3s,789680,793040,so in my case i've chosen to have an sd
EIKnxWxiS3s,793040,795920,and also two cf express slots for the
EIKnxWxiS3s,795920,799120,larger red cards as well as a cfast for
EIKnxWxiS3s,799120,800959,the red komodo so it's kind of like a
EIKnxWxiS3s,800959,803839,central hub of where all of my cards go
EIKnxWxiS3s,803839,805600,as soon as i've recorded a ton of
EIKnxWxiS3s,805600,807360,footage so you have like a lot of sd
EIKnxWxiS3s,807360,809120,cards you can pick to have like two of
EIKnxWxiS3s,809120,810800,these types of
EIKnxWxiS3s,810800,813200,card readers and they are able to pop in
EIKnxWxiS3s,813200,815760,and out very very easily you just
EIKnxWxiS3s,815760,817680,go like that you can take this with you
EIKnxWxiS3s,817680,819920,anywhere utilize the cable still and
EIKnxWxiS3s,819920,821839,have a portable card reader and they
EIKnxWxiS3s,821839,823279,stack up pretty nicely but as soon as
EIKnxWxiS3s,823279,825120,you get home and want to have it back
EIKnxWxiS3s,825120,826639,into like the central dock with
EIKnxWxiS3s,826639,828320,everything else you have that option as
EIKnxWxiS3s,828320,830000,well so when it comes like a great
EIKnxWxiS3s,830000,831680,wireless earbud option for like your
EIKnxWxiS3s,831680,833120,desk setup or like your everyday
EIKnxWxiS3s,833120,835040,workflow there are quite a few options
EIKnxWxiS3s,835040,836880,out there there are headphone options
EIKnxWxiS3s,836880,838639,that are very very immersive there's
EIKnxWxiS3s,838639,840720,also truly wireless earbud which i feel
EIKnxWxiS3s,840720,842480,like is the best medium especially with
EIKnxWxiS3s,842480,844320,all the great offerings on the market
EIKnxWxiS3s,844320,846480,today and one of my favorites is from
EIKnxWxiS3s,846480,848800,sony recently i've tested out a lot of
EIKnxWxiS3s,848800,850639,wireless earbuds some of them are better
EIKnxWxiS3s,850639,852639,for flights some of them are better for
EIKnxWxiS3s,852639,854240,like making calls because of the mic
EIKnxWxiS3s,854240,855839,quality but one of the best ones that
EIKnxWxiS3s,855839,857360,i've tested out overall is the
EIKnxWxiS3s,857360,859519,wf-1000xm4
EIKnxWxiS3s,859519,861519,which is an absolutely horrible name
EIKnxWxiS3s,861519,863760,that i just can't seem to remember but i
EIKnxWxiS3s,863760,865120,do like some of the improvements that
EIKnxWxiS3s,865120,866959,sony has made in the past couple years
EIKnxWxiS3s,866959,868560,when it comes to like the overall case
EIKnxWxiS3s,868560,871040,size the sound quality the comfort and
EIKnxWxiS3s,871040,873360,also their focus on like 360 reality
EIKnxWxiS3s,873360,876160,audio as well as the microphone so these
EIKnxWxiS3s,876160,877600,are definitely not like the smallest
EIKnxWxiS3s,877600,879120,earbuds if you're looking for something
EIKnxWxiS3s,879120,881040,that is very discreet to wear in public
EIKnxWxiS3s,881040,882800,there are better options out there but
EIKnxWxiS3s,882800,884560,at your own desk setup if you want the
EIKnxWxiS3s,884560,886959,best sound quality great connectivity
EIKnxWxiS3s,886959,889040,and good mic quality for like doing
EIKnxWxiS3s,889040,890959,conference calls and zoom for work and
EIKnxWxiS3s,890959,892560,all that kind of stuff then this is
EIKnxWxiS3s,892560,894160,probably my favorite choice at the
EIKnxWxiS3s,894160,896720,moment the sound quality is excellent
EIKnxWxiS3s,896720,898320,you can go ahead and change the eq and
EIKnxWxiS3s,898320,899680,all those functions within the app but
EIKnxWxiS3s,899680,901760,it has a good driver size a great amount
EIKnxWxiS3s,901760,903920,of power it is relatively clear and the
EIKnxWxiS3s,903920,905920,base is there as well on top of that
EIKnxWxiS3s,905920,907760,when it comes to like comfort and seal
EIKnxWxiS3s,907760,910240,these utilize polyurethane foam which
EIKnxWxiS3s,910240,912320,kind of remind me of the comply foam ear
EIKnxWxiS3s,912320,914320,tips that i reviewed on the channel way
EIKnxWxiS3s,914320,916079,back in the day they really give you
EIKnxWxiS3s,916079,918880,like a customized and molded feel and as
EIKnxWxiS3s,918880,920720,you can see it just has like that kind
EIKnxWxiS3s,920720,923120,of memory foam type of characteristic
EIKnxWxiS3s,923120,925199,and that is able to just lock into the
EIKnxWxiS3s,925199,926880,ear and that is going to give you a
EIKnxWxiS3s,926880,928639,great level of comfort throughout many
EIKnxWxiS3s,928639,930560,hours if i had to pick one truly
EIKnxWxiS3s,930560,933279,wireless earbud to use at my home office
EIKnxWxiS3s,933279,935839,desk setup every single day then this is
EIKnxWxiS3s,935839,937519,going to be the one because all the
EIKnxWxiS3s,937519,939199,major features when it comes to like
EIKnxWxiS3s,939199,940959,sound quality and areas that you would
EIKnxWxiS3s,940959,943040,value in a home setup all come together
EIKnxWxiS3s,943040,945199,with the xm4s so for anyone who is

EIKnxWxiS3s,948639,950000,maybe just have like a really good
EIKnxWxiS3s,950000,952560,microphone for conference calls or
EIKnxWxiS3s,952560,954320,perhaps you're like recording tech talks

EIKnxWxiS3s,960399,962880,affordable and easy to use price point
EIKnxWxiS3s,962880,964079,for those who have like watched my
EIKnxWxiS3s,964079,966079,podcast i use the
EIKnxWxiS3s,966079,966959,famous
EIKnxWxiS3s,966959,969279,sure microphone the sm7bs and that
EIKnxWxiS3s,969279,971120,needed like a cloud lifter as well as
EIKnxWxiS3s,971120,972959,like a preamp and all that kind of stuff
EIKnxWxiS3s,972959,975040,but what they released last year was the
EIKnxWxiS3s,975040,978480,mv7 and the mv7x the difference is the
EIKnxWxiS3s,978480,982320,mv7 just says xlr and the mv7x has both
EIKnxWxiS3s,982320,984800,xlr and usb which is the model that i
EIKnxWxiS3s,984800,986480,have right here and i just like how
EIKnxWxiS3s,986480,988560,versatile it is but how it has like that
EIKnxWxiS3s,988560,991199,sure radio sound signature at a smaller
EIKnxWxiS3s,991199,992959,form factor while still giving you all
EIKnxWxiS3s,992959,994480,the great characteristics of their
EIKnxWxiS3s,994480,996480,flagship microphone that is essentially
EIKnxWxiS3s,996480,998800,seen in every big podcast out there
EIKnxWxiS3s,998800,1000079,you're hearing the audio from it right
EIKnxWxiS3s,1000079,1002320,now and i have it connected to my mix
EIKnxWxiS3s,1002320,1003920,pre preamp but if you want to just
EIKnxWxiS3s,1003920,1005519,connect it to the computer i've actually
EIKnxWxiS3s,1005519,1007120,done that many times as well via the
EIKnxWxiS3s,1007120,1008959,micro usb i would have liked to have
EIKnxWxiS3s,1008959,1011279,seen usb type c but what i loved about
EIKnxWxiS3s,1011279,1012639,it is that you have the option to use it
EIKnxWxiS3s,1012639,1014880,in the auto mode but also customize all
EIKnxWxiS3s,1014880,1016399,the different sound signatures the
EIKnxWxiS3s,1016399,1018639,characteristics the volume and all that
EIKnxWxiS3s,1018639,1020399,kind of stuff and it actually has that
EIKnxWxiS3s,1020399,1022320,light indicator right here so you can
EIKnxWxiS3s,1022320,1024400,kind of track it real time but you also
EIKnxWxiS3s,1024400,1025760,have the option to monitor it through
EIKnxWxiS3s,1025760,1027760,the headphone jack on the back so
EIKnxWxiS3s,1027760,1029120,depending on what you need you can
EIKnxWxiS3s,1029120,1031038,either get the xlr only version which is
EIKnxWxiS3s,1031038,1032319,a little bit cheaper or if you're
EIKnxWxiS3s,1032319,1034558,looking for a great desktop microphone
EIKnxWxiS3s,1034558,1036880,that is like not too big but at the same
EIKnxWxiS3s,1036880,1038720,time easy to use and you can take it
EIKnxWxiS3s,1038720,1040319,with you and use it in versatile
EIKnxWxiS3s,1040319,1043438,situations between usb and xlr then the
EIKnxWxiS3s,1043438,1045678,mvx7 is probably one of the best options
EIKnxWxiS3s,1045678,1047520,overall that you can buy today one of
EIKnxWxiS3s,1047520,1048799,the type of products that i've seen a
EIKnxWxiS3s,1048799,1050480,lot of in the last year though is
EIKnxWxiS3s,1050480,1052799,gallium nitrate chargers it's been like
EIKnxWxiS3s,1052799,1054720,a booming industry and a lot of these
EIKnxWxiS3s,1054720,1057039,like high wattage chargers are coming in
EIKnxWxiS3s,1057039,1059360,all different sorts of features form
EIKnxWxiS3s,1059360,1062160,factors and configurations and the
EIKnxWxiS3s,1062160,1063919,biggest thing is that they're able to
EIKnxWxiS3s,1063919,1066559,charge your device safely affordably at
EIKnxWxiS3s,1066559,1068000,a high wattage and if you have like the
EIKnxWxiS3s,1068000,1070000,new macbook or something then having a
EIKnxWxiS3s,1070000,1072000,high wattage charger is really nice and
EIKnxWxiS3s,1072000,1073440,so like this one right here for example
EIKnxWxiS3s,1073440,1075600,is from you green it's a 100 watt
EIKnxWxiS3s,1075600,1077120,charger but at the same time you have
EIKnxWxiS3s,1077120,1080320,three usb type-c ports a usb type a port
EIKnxWxiS3s,1080320,1082080,and depending on what you plug into it
EIKnxWxiS3s,1082080,1083840,simultaneously it will adjust the
EIKnxWxiS3s,1083840,1085760,wattage accordingly so if you have like
EIKnxWxiS3s,1085760,1087600,multiple devices it will distribute the
EIKnxWxiS3s,1087600,1089760,wattage evenly but if you just have one
EIKnxWxiS3s,1089760,1091440,port connected to like your macbook it
EIKnxWxiS3s,1091440,1094240,will utilize that full 100 watts which
EIKnxWxiS3s,1094240,1096160,is awesome it also comes in at a very
EIKnxWxiS3s,1096160,1098000,portable size you have like the flip
EIKnxWxiS3s,1098000,1100080,prong and it's a lot cheaper than
EIKnxWxiS3s,1100080,1102480,apple's option and i find that having
EIKnxWxiS3s,1102480,1104080,two or three of them is really really
EIKnxWxiS3s,1104080,1105919,handy especially with the different desk
