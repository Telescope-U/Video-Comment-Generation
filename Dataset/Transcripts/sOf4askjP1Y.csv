sOf4askjP1Y,39705,43542,"Woman: I believe, like, harder you work out in the gym,"
sOf4askjP1Y,43676,45343,"getting ready for the fight,"
sOf4askjP1Y,45478,48114,easier the fight gonna be.
sOf4askjP1Y,49449,51917,There is no easy opponents.
sOf4askjP1Y,52051,55855,"All girls who I fight with, they are very strong,"
sOf4askjP1Y,55988,60927,"but I train like double, triple harders than everyone"
sOf4askjP1Y,61061,64764,to make this fight looks easier.
sOf4askjP1Y,70937,72338,Man: She kicks hard.
sOf4askjP1Y,72471,74640,"She lands, like, with pinpoint accuracy, too."
sOf4askjP1Y,74773,76709,"If she were to land out on anybody,"
sOf4askjP1Y,76842,80213,that's good night for them! Ha ha ha ha!
sOf4askjP1Y,82715,87353,"Woman: I grew up doing martial arts since 5 years old,"
sOf4askjP1Y,87487,90089,"20 years constantly,"
sOf4askjP1Y,90222,92492,training all the time.
sOf4askjP1Y,92625,95995,"and spending, like, mostly my time in the gym,"
sOf4askjP1Y,96128,98431,"in competition, in the fight."
sOf4askjP1Y,98564,100800,The fight's very hard for me to divide.
sOf4askjP1Y,100934,102634,Where is the fight discipline
sOf4askjP1Y,102768,104937,"and where's just, like, live discipline?"
sOf4askjP1Y,105070,110110,"For me, it's altogether, and it's just worked for me well!"
sOf4askjP1Y,186018,188254,[Beeping]
sOf4askjP1Y,190022,192991,"Man: It's always good when I'm in a cover, you know,"
sOf4askjP1Y,193125,194727,especially this one.
sOf4askjP1Y,194861,196663,Got the belt.
sOf4askjP1Y,199699,203402,I bought my house when I have 4 fights already in UFC.
sOf4askjP1Y,203536,205371,"You know, so I bought the house. OK?"
sOf4askjP1Y,205504,208107,"And then I put 4 poster in this whole, you know--"
sOf4askjP1Y,208241,210375,"in the whole thing, I say--"
sOf4askjP1Y,210510,215681,"I say, ""When I fill up the who--all the wall..."""
sOf4askjP1Y,215815,217416,Man: You gotta buy a bigger house.
sOf4askjP1Y,217549,219651,"No. I fill up all the wall, I'm gonna retire."
sOf4askjP1Y,219785,222255,"I say that as a joke, you know."
sOf4askjP1Y,222388,225258,And 2 more. Man: Really?
sOf4askjP1Y,225391,227460,Glover: 2 more. This one and the one more.
sOf4askjP1Y,227593,229028,Then it filled.
sOf4askjP1Y,229162,230629,"Yeah, this thing."
sOf4askjP1Y,230763,232431,"Either buy another house, like he say,"
sOf4askjP1Y,232565,234400,"or, uh, why stop."
sOf4askjP1Y,234533,236702,"It's 2 options, you know."
sOf4askjP1Y,236835,240239,"Either way is good, you know."
sOf4askjP1Y,240373,242141,"Man: That's it. Thank you, sir."
sOf4askjP1Y,242275,243909,Glover: Oh. Done.
sOf4askjP1Y,244043,245378,Man: Appreciate it.
sOf4askjP1Y,245511,246979,Glover: Thank you. Man: A pleasure.
sOf4askjP1Y,247112,248615,Glover: All right.
sOf4askjP1Y,250950,252485,"Man: How you doing, boss?"
sOf4askjP1Y,252618,256988,"Glover: I got to wait for, I guess a guy over there."
sOf4askjP1Y,257122,258390,Forrest: You got to wait.
sOf4askjP1Y,258523,260325,They're makin' the champ wait.
sOf4askjP1Y,260459,262694,"Glover: This is [bleep], you know, Forrest?"
sOf4askjP1Y,262828,265598,"They did that to you when you were a champ, man? This is--no."
sOf4askjP1Y,265731,267633,Forrest: I wasn't a champ for very long.
sOf4askjP1Y,267766,270736,"I don't remember, but they shouldn't do it to you."
sOf4askjP1Y,270869,272703,"Glover: Ah, man... Forrest: I mean, it's--"
sOf4askjP1Y,272838,274540,Glover: You know why you won the belt?
sOf4askjP1Y,274674,278077,I was going to Brazil. I saw you fight with Rampage
sOf4askjP1Y,278211,279612,in the airport New York City.
sOf4askjP1Y,279745,281780,I was going to Brazil for my green card.
sOf4askjP1Y,281914,284984,"You won in 2008, right? July 2008."
sOf4askjP1Y,285117,287887,But that went out-- Forrest: He said--he said...
sOf4askjP1Y,288020,291156,"""[Bleep], I can be champ. I can whoop that dude's ass."""
sOf4askjP1Y,291290,292791,[Laughter]
sOf4askjP1Y,292925,295361,"But that was what gave you the shock, right there."
sOf4askjP1Y,295495,297429,Jeremy Horn did the same thing for me.
sOf4askjP1Y,297563,299764,"I saw Jeremy Horn, and I said, ""Ah, [bleep]."""
sOf4askjP1Y,299899,301432,"Glover: Of course, every time you win--"
sOf4askjP1Y,301567,303168,"you know, somebody win the belt,"
sOf4askjP1Y,303302,305204,"you thinking of the guy. Forrest: ""I get that guy."""
sOf4askjP1Y,305338,306773,"Glover: You know, ""I get that guy."""
sOf4askjP1Y,306906,310542,"You know, I was like, ""Rampage [indistinct],"""
sOf4askjP1Y,310676,313279,"And then, he [indistinct], 'cause he also was"
sOf4askjP1Y,313413,314814,in [indistinct]'s team.
sOf4askjP1Y,314947,316416,Yeah.
sOf4askjP1Y,319885,321587,"Man: And then at some point in time, Jiri,"
sOf4askjP1Y,321720,323355,can you have somebody bring down your mouthguard
sOf4askjP1Y,323488,325424,so I can take a picture of it?
sOf4askjP1Y,325557,326892,Everything?
sOf4askjP1Y,327026,329395,Jiri: This is 3 types of because I--
sOf4askjP1Y,329528,331864,Man: All good. Jiri: I forgot it at home and...
sOf4askjP1Y,331998,334667,and my friends took me from--
sOf4askjP1Y,334800,337136,Man: Depends how we wake up. Man: Gotcha.
sOf4askjP1Y,337269,339372,[Laughter]
sOf4askjP1Y,340840,342341,Man: You're the only one with that hairstyle.
sOf4askjP1Y,342475,344810,"Jiri: Last time, I had-- I had much bigger."
sOf4askjP1Y,344943,346578,"Man: Yeah? Jiri: I was in guillotine,"
sOf4askjP1Y,346712,348247,and it was [bleep] hard to--
sOf4askjP1Y,348380,349581,[Laughter]
sOf4askjP1Y,349715,351250,Man: Reverse it out of there?
sOf4askjP1Y,351383,352652,Jiri: Yeah.
sOf4askjP1Y,354353,356087,Yep. Man: Good?
sOf4askjP1Y,356221,358124,[Beeping]
sOf4askjP1Y,359758,363029,"Oh, is it the-- is it the rust"
sOf4askjP1Y,363162,364496,or the suntan from Florida?
sOf4askjP1Y,364630,366632,"Oh, I don't know. Let's find out."
sOf4askjP1Y,369869,372772,"Woman: How are you? Joanna: Good to see you, too."
sOf4askjP1Y,375441,377076,Hello! [Indistinct]
sOf4askjP1Y,377209,378578,[Laughter]
sOf4askjP1Y,378711,381981,How is your day? She's the tallest.
sOf4askjP1Y,382114,384316,[All talking at once]
sOf4askjP1Y,384450,385751,Wait. Is lots skinnier.
sOf4askjP1Y,385884,387286,Woman: Yeah. Joanna: All good?
sOf4askjP1Y,387420,389055,"Did you train? Woman: Yes, I did."
sOf4askjP1Y,389188,391457,In the morning. I'm getting used for the morning training.
sOf4askjP1Y,391591,393359,Joanna: Of course. Let's rock and roll.
sOf4askjP1Y,393492,395628,Woman: See you.
sOf4askjP1Y,395761,397964,[Upbeat music playing]
sOf4askjP1Y,401700,403435,"Come on, dance with me."
sOf4askjP1Y,403568,405805,Can you move a little bit?
sOf4askjP1Y,462028,463663,Woman: Thank you.
sOf4askjP1Y,492358,495027,"Man: Yeah, let's get it over here, will you?"
sOf4askjP1Y,495160,496929,"You're right. There you go, brother."
sOf4askjP1Y,497063,499264,All right. Man: That looks good.
sOf4askjP1Y,506872,508741,Woman: Ready? Jiri: Yeah.
sOf4askjP1Y,512344,515614,"Man: Hey, guys. Face the camera. Yep. Perfect."
sOf4askjP1Y,515748,518117,"Hey, fellas. All right."
sOf4askjP1Y,518250,521219,And then we'll square off. Just face each other.
sOf4askjP1Y,529161,532064,"Perfect. OK, guys. Thank you."
sOf4askjP1Y,533866,535835,Jiri: Good? Woman: Yeah.
sOf4askjP1Y,560659,564396,"I feel just... that's another fight,"
sOf4askjP1Y,564530,565998,another opponent...
sOf4askjP1Y,567933,571536,but the prize is there.
sOf4askjP1Y,571670,573772,"Prize is here,"
sOf4askjP1Y,573906,575641,and I will take it.
