uvbVzutfulU,58399,64878,it's not a complicated process but it it  definitely requires  uh discipline it requires insulating
uvbVzutfulU,64878,70479,yourself  from popular opinion you just you simply  cannot you can't pay attention to it it
uvbVzutfulU,70479,76640,just doesn't mean anything  so you got to have a goal you got to  have a dream
uvbVzutfulU,76640,81759,you got to get hungry and then you got  to get real discipline
uvbVzutfulU,82159,88000,because motivation will get you going a  speech will get you fired up

uvbVzutfulU,268479,273840,and let me tell you who's going to win  that battle  the one who cares the most because that
uvbVzutfulU,273840,279840,lion knows if i give all my energy after  this gazelle  and if i miss the gazelle if i don't  catch the gazelle
uvbVzutfulU,279840,285840,i've exerted all this energy and i don't  get to eat i gotta wait for another day  to eat  i'm in trouble because i won't have the
uvbVzutfulU,285840,292080,same strength tomorrow i don't have the  same focus tomorrow i don't have the  same drive tomorrow i want to have the  same energy tomorrow
uvbVzutfulU,292080,297600,so i've got to care enough that i see  this opportunity i see that gazelle  coming by

uvbVzutfulU,380800,387759,that that lion is hungry enough and if  you care enough  he gonna get that gazelle but if that
uvbVzutfulU,387759,393759,gazelle  is fast enough and elusive enough
uvbVzutfulU,393759,398800,that gazelle go get away
uvbVzutfulU,398800,406319,when you wake up in the morning every  day  you gotta care and you gotta live your

uvbVzutfulU,441599,448479,there is a student mentality in all of  us  that must be tapped into a student
uvbVzutfulU,448479,454000,is resilient a student is disciplined  it is only through discipline that you
uvbVzutfulU,454000,462000,will experience  the freedom of a warrior a student  never surrenders see the strategy is the
uvbVzutfulU,462000,470960,plan  the strategy the game plan the plan of  action  the recipe the how must be studied
uvbVzutfulU,470960,477199,before the first step is taken  i am convinced that so many of us lose
uvbVzutfulU,477199,483199,because of what we were not willing to  study we must  grow a discipline to deliberately
uvbVzutfulU,483199,491680,investigate  what we are getting ready to enter into  we must be  calculated as we enter into new seasons
uvbVzutfulU,491680,498800,into new relationships  this is the road to becoming a warrior
uvbVzutfulU,499120,507039,an experienced skilled and calculated  soldier  a fighter a game changer somebody who
uvbVzutfulU,507039,514640,refuses  to stay down this is somebody who is set  apart  from those who operate in the realm of
uvbVzutfulU,514640,521039,normalcy  this is somebody who is above and beyond  we got a bit of a work ethic to go after
uvbVzutfulU,521039,528560,it a student  is a disciple and a disciple is  disciplined  disciplined to achieve the spirit of the
uvbVzutfulU,528560,535600,warrior  they are perfectly positioned for  victory daily  discipline is an invitation out of
uvbVzutfulU,535600,540720,normalcy  a man who studies is a man who is  allergic to average
uvbVzutfulU,540720,545040,so you are a warrior then you don't even  know it
uvbVzutfulU,547040,554480,take a deep breath inhale  and exhale inhale
uvbVzutfulU,554480,562320,and exhale after today  everything is about to change
uvbVzutfulU,562320,568000,because change starts with you  [Music]  to understand this is to know the
uvbVzutfulU,568000,577120,difference between men  and lions

uvbVzutfulU,596480,602720,intentional  about setting the tone for how your year  is going to turn out
uvbVzutfulU,602720,610320,the nightmare is to reach our 60s our  70s our 80s  or even our deathbed and to talk about
uvbVzutfulU,610320,615680,everything we  should have done i should have done that  i should have invested in this
uvbVzutfulU,615680,621680,i should have made the relationship work  i shouldn't have got a divorce  there are things that you have been
uvbVzutfulU,621680,628399,called to do  but it is the challenges that makes us  great
uvbVzutfulU,628399,634399,the challenges is what builds us up the  hardships  all of these things that we all had to
uvbVzutfulU,634399,639839,endure  nothing can stop
uvbVzutfulU,639839,645920,what we are made of where am i  where am i trying to go what am i trying

uvbVzutfulU,666640,674720,chance is all up to you  and you alone don't just do enough to
uvbVzutfulU,674720,679920,get by  exceed expectations over deliver and you  will find that that same
uvbVzutfulU,679920,686000,energy that you're putting in is coming  back to you  gotta have a dream and you have to put
uvbVzutfulU,686000,692959,it on the calendar and you have to break  it down  bit by bit piece by piece day by day
uvbVzutfulU,692959,698079,these are not your years when you just  settle for an average  marriage and settle for an average
uvbVzutfulU,698079,705839,career and settle  for an average worship life no this is  the year  that you decide i want new i want
uvbVzutfulU,705839,717839,fresh i want the real stuff you got to  renew your mind
uvbVzutfulU,722620,731839,[Music]  i must
uvbVzutfulU,732400,740639,[Music]  everybody gets this wrong
uvbVzutfulU,743360,750639,i talk to millions of people across 50  countries  it's life's big myth that you can get
uvbVzutfulU,750639,757600,fit before committing to something  challenging  let me explain we call it the spartan
uvbVzutfulU,757600,764320,paradox you must  first commit to something and that
uvbVzutfulU,764320,770959,forces you to do the work  with spartan we got seven million people
uvbVzutfulU,770959,776480,off the couch  by having them put a date on the  calendar
uvbVzutfulU,776480,782630,it's that simple  [Music]
uvbVzutfulU,783600,792320,once you put a date on the calendar you  get serious  you become disciplined and if you don't
uvbVzutfulU,792320,801120,you get your ass kicked because that day  comes  that event arrives with or without you
uvbVzutfulU,801120,808000,then what then you're embarrassed  humiliated  and you want another crack at it
uvbVzutfulU,808000,816079,everyone  everywhere i mean across 45 countries  says to me  oh first i'm going to get in shape first
uvbVzutfulU,816079,821519,i'm going to start eating healthy  first i'm going to get my lifestyle  intact
uvbVzutfulU,821519,828639,no way all the science  all the data all of our millions of
uvbVzutfulU,828639,835360,conversations across all these countries  says  bullsh you're just gonna procrastinate
uvbVzutfulU,835360,841680,you're not gonna do it  you end up talking yourself out of doing  the work
uvbVzutfulU,841680,848959,new year's resolutions don't work gym  memberships don't work  diets don't work the only thing that
uvbVzutfulU,848959,856959,works  is a date with something challenging  on your calendar so you want to find
uvbVzutfulU,856959,862399,success  put a date on the calendar create a  deadline force yourself
uvbVzutfulU,862399,867920,to make the hard choices daily look  if humans didn't need deadlines schools
uvbVzutfulU,867920,873920,wouldn't need professors  right construction sites wouldn't need  foreman teams wouldn't need coaches
uvbVzutfulU,873920,880880,think about it you want to change if  you're ready  get a date on your calendar you have to
uvbVzutfulU,880880,886170,commit  you have to make it real it's a spartan  paradigm
uvbVzutfulU,886170,898079,[Music]  i think i could end it just like that  it's the spartan paradox that's it
uvbVzutfulU,898079,903120,your mouth is a creative weapon
uvbVzutfulU,903120,909839,it's not a tool for distributing excuses  the first sign of a loser
uvbVzutfulU,909839,916560,is an excuse champions  take full responsibility good or bad for
uvbVzutfulU,916560,924800,their outcomes  tell the world one time  what you're gonna do and that's it spend
uvbVzutfulU,924800,930399,less time talking  and more time grinding think like a  champion
uvbVzutfulU,930399,937360,speak like a champion and then work it  out  grind 1 20 all day
uvbVzutfulU,937360,944399,every day stop making excuses champions  make adjustments not excuses
uvbVzutfulU,944399,952800,every time you justify being average  you're inviting the enemy  mediocrity is a dream killer your coach
uvbVzutfulU,952800,959120,your trainer your teacher your foes is  not the problem  it's your consistency you got to make a
uvbVzutfulU,959120,964639,decision how bad do you want it  average is on the left success is on the
uvbVzutfulU,964639,969920,right  you got to choose which one you want a  champion's workout
uvbVzutfulU,969920,976720,doesn't officially begin  until pain arrives you see
uvbVzutfulU,976720,982320,greatness is right on the other side of  pain  so what are you running from it for you
uvbVzutfulU,982320,988079,say you want to be successful then push  through it stop making excuses and go  get it
uvbVzutfulU,988079,995040,very few battles are won  under ideal circumstances so you gotta
uvbVzutfulU,995040,1000480,simulate and practice  the unknown so that the unexpected will
uvbVzutfulU,1000480,1006079,not derail you  every morning when you get up ask  yourself
uvbVzutfulU,1006079,1012079,how can i put myself in a place  where i'll be uncomfortable see you have
uvbVzutfulU,1012079,1019920,to master  the unknown you gotta master your fears  you gotta master the unexpected so when
uvbVzutfulU,1019920,1025120,it happens  you are prepared champions can push  through
uvbVzutfulU,1025120,1031520,and keep going when everyone else around  them  is quitting they have immersed
uvbVzutfulU,1031520,1036798,themselves  in pain so often that they have become  immune to it
uvbVzutfulU,1036798,1044319,greatness is on the other side of pain  go get it  the more you expose yourself to pain
uvbVzutfulU,1044319,1050799,the more comfortable you will become in  his presence  a champion's workout doesn't officially
uvbVzutfulU,1050799,1056080,start  until pain arrives everything else is  just a woman
uvbVzutfulU,1056080,1062320,a boxer can be the best technician  in the world but if he gets in the ring
uvbVzutfulU,1062320,1067919,and the first time he gets hit  he falls apart he's not going to be a  champion i tell you that
uvbVzutfulU,1067919,1072960,see in life is just like that with us  we're good until we get hit in the face
uvbVzutfulU,1072960,1079440,but what separates champions from the  rest is when they get hit  they keep coming when you hit them a
uvbVzutfulU,1079440,1084640,second time  they get stronger and by the third time  that life hits you
uvbVzutfulU,1084640,1090960,and you're still standing the world will  know  there's a jacket in the ring how bad do
uvbVzutfulU,1090960,1097280,you want to be successful  do you want it bad enough to get hit in  the face
uvbVzutfulU,1097280,1103600,because i tell you right now that's what  life's gonna do to you  it's gonna hit you when you least expect
uvbVzutfulU,1103600,1109679,it when you got your guard down  how will you respond refuse to let the  world break you
uvbVzutfulU,1109679,1116480,show life what a champion looks like  i'm billy all's brooks blessed and
uvbVzutfulU,1120840,1126799,unstoppable  we all have two people we all have two
uvbVzutfulU,1126799,1133039,people  and i'm not saying you're crazy we have  the easy voice
uvbVzutfulU,1133360,1139120,that's that voice that we all love  that's that very  comfortable voice that that's that mommy
uvbVzutfulU,1139120,1144720,holding you saying  it's going to be okay doesn't care how  good you are
uvbVzutfulU,1144720,1150240,just loves you just loves you no matter  how messed up you are in life
uvbVzutfulU,1150240,1156320,so that's that one voice this other  voice that we walk  very far away from is the voice saying
uvbVzutfulU,1156320,1163039,hey man  you ain't doing it so we try to get this  voice out of our head completely
uvbVzutfulU,1163039,1169520,and we live over here in this land so  what you have to do first  is turn up this voice over here the
uvbVzutfulU,1169520,1175840,voice saying things to you  that aren't nice that it's in our heads  saying you know what man
uvbVzutfulU,1175840,1182400,dude you're not you're not doing it  i'm not saying to put yourself down i'm
uvbVzutfulU,1182400,1188160,saying listen to the truth  and the truth isn't in the 20
uvbVzutfulU,1188160,1194160,the truth is in this other part of your  brain saying look man  you're wasting a bunch of percentage
uvbVzutfulU,1194160,1201840,here we have 80 more percent that we're  not tapping into because  in this other 80 is suffering
uvbVzutfulU,1201840,1210480,pain failure failure  failure self-doubt darkness
uvbVzutfulU,1210480,1217200,and then a whole bunch of light  but to get to this light you gotta go  through all of this
uvbVzutfulU,1217200,1223039,so a lot of us know that i can get over  here  but over here man this is much better
uvbVzutfulU,1223039,1229120,because i gotta go through this journey  that is not fun this this from 20 to 100
uvbVzutfulU,1229120,1235520,percent  this [ __ ] in between is not fun  so we decided to live over here so
uvbVzutfulU,1235520,1240880,everybody goes how do you do that  you know exactly how to do that you know  exactly
uvbVzutfulU,1240880,1248000,it's not a magic trick there's nothing  to talk about  that's a magic trick it's all back down
uvbVzutfulU,1248000,1255679,to a very primitive  mindset of we just have to do
uvbVzutfulU,1255679,1261760,it's like breathing breathing becomes  normal like  we don't know that that that we're doing
uvbVzutfulU,1261760,1265679,that's how you have to live your life
uvbVzutfulU,1270880,1276559,when that alarm clock goes off at four  or five in the morning  your mind says no you just say it's just
uvbVzutfulU,1276559,1281919,what we do  it's what we do now because to get to  where you want to go
uvbVzutfulU,1281919,1287360,the amount of pain involved i'm not  saying physical  i'm not saying you got to break yourself

uvbVzutfulU,1582080,1591039,many people ask  why do you rise and i tell them
uvbVzutfulU,1591039,1599200,this is why  i rise
uvbVzutfulU,1599200,1604640,i rise for those that paved the way  before me
uvbVzutfulU,1604640,1613039,and gave me belief and the power  if you see me as a giant
uvbVzutfulU,1613039,1618080,it is only because i am standing on  their shoulders  [Music]
uvbVzutfulU,1618080,1624960,i rise because  it is my will my passion
uvbVzutfulU,1624960,1632960,my burning desire and i cannot  stand still i rise
uvbVzutfulU,1632960,1638720,because i know that i have a legacy to  fulfill
uvbVzutfulU,1638880,1646480,i rise because this is my journey  not just a destination
uvbVzutfulU,1646880,1653520,i rise because i  am the creation i rise because
uvbVzutfulU,1653520,1660640,every second every minute every hour  every day  every week every month every year
uvbVzutfulU,1660640,1669840,that goes by brings me closer  to fulfilling my ultimate obligation
uvbVzutfulU,1670320,1676720,i rise because i lead an army  of kings and queens  [Music]
uvbVzutfulU,1676720,1685039,and this is the dawning  of a new day i rise
uvbVzutfulU,1685039,1694000,because we are many like grains of sand  i rise before i leave
uvbVzutfulU,1694320,1699039,but first i must pave the way
uvbVzutfulU,1699360,1706880,i rise because if anyone can do it  i know i can i rise because
uvbVzutfulU,1706880,1712000,people like martin malcolm marcus garvey
uvbVzutfulU,1712000,1718960,their life for the struggle  i rise because people like rosa
uvbVzutfulU,1718960,1724960,oprah harry and coretta stood tall in  the face of adversity
uvbVzutfulU,1724960,1731440,i rise because i have a dream  i rise because i will see that dream
uvbVzutfulU,1731440,1739679,fulfilled  by any means necessary i  rise because i know
uvbVzutfulU,1739679,1746720,that none but ourselves can free our  minds  from mental slavery this
uvbVzutfulU,1746720,1754398,is why i rise  why do you rise
uvbVzutfulU,1757039,1763760,yeah i always wanted to be a commando  ever since i was a little kid  and i heard that the seals were
uvbVzutfulU,1763760,1768880,really tough and that the training was  really tough and then  you know once you get in everyone makes
uvbVzutfulU,1768880,1775520,a big deal out of buds that's  but it's it's in the seal teams it's no  big deal
uvbVzutfulU,1777440,1784880,everyone goes through it you get cold  you get wet  whatever you do a bunch of push-ups and
uvbVzutfulU,1784880,1787760,pull-ups and dips
uvbVzutfulU,1790559,1797120,anyone that gets to the seal teams and  does deployments  overseas and has a real career
uvbVzutfulU,1797120,1802960,they're not talking about buds training  it just  just doesn't mean anything
uvbVzutfulU,1805760,1811760,heidight was you know a ncaa water polo  team captain champion we quit and i had
uvbVzutfulU,1811760,1817360,a guy that was an olympic ultimate  gymnast and he quit just because
uvbVzutfulU,1817360,1824480,someone's  a good physical athlete  it doesn't mean that they're a good seal
uvbVzutfulU,1824480,1830080,because being a good seal is a lot more  than just being a good athlete  being a good athlete is like the
uvbVzutfulU,1830080,1835279,baseline and  it's everything that you've learned to  do after that a good leader a guy that's
uvbVzutfulU,1835279,1841679,tactically sound a guy that makes good  decisions a guy that's good under  pressure  a guy that doesn't ever give up on
uvbVzutfulU,1841679,1847278,trying to accomplish a mission  those are the things that makes good  seal
uvbVzutfulU,1849600,1855520,so you're always learning and growing  and i was always learning until the day  i retired  because it's not a boom this happened
uvbVzutfulU,1855520,1861279,and everything changes it's a constant  addition of skill set and repetition
uvbVzutfulU,1861279,1867200,of situations where you become competent  at your job
uvbVzutfulU,1867760,1874080,to that same young man that wants to be  a seal you know the guys that  want to be like jocko one day what do
uvbVzutfulU,1874080,1879240,you tell that that 20 year old that  sees this thing and says i want to go do  that
uvbVzutfulU,1879240,1887278,[Music]  well first of all don't try and be like  me be better than me
uvbVzutfulU,1887519,1895360,crush me make me look like a baby that's  what you that's what you do  and and don't don't
uvbVzutfulU,1895360,1902320,talk about it don't mull it over don't  plan  for it just get after it
uvbVzutfulU,1902320,1907679,just get after it make it happen
uvbVzutfulU,1907679,1913519,use your force of will to make it happen  as a human being the strongest thing
uvbVzutfulU,1913519,1920799,you've got is your force of will  [Music]  so take that force of will and make that
uvbVzutfulU,1920799,1931120,happen  [Music]
uvbVzutfulU,1931120,1936860,your perspective can either become your  prison  or your passport
uvbVzutfulU,1936860,1944559,[Music]  it can either arrest you or release you  [Music]
uvbVzutfulU,1944559,1950159,in 1903 it was the wright brothers that  defied the laws of gravity and if you
uvbVzutfulU,1950159,1955279,know anything about gravity gravity  will pull you down and keep you down it
uvbVzutfulU,1955279,1961279,will stop you  from flight it will stop you in your  tracks  if you believe in something
uvbVzutfulU,1961279,1966559,metaphorically speaking gravity will  hold you down  it will hold you back and it will dare
uvbVzutfulU,1966559,1972000,you to fight  your perspective can either breathe your  prison or your plane
uvbVzutfulU,1972000,1979840,i don't know about you but today  i made the decision to defy the laws of
uvbVzutfulU,1979840,1986000,gravity  the first successful heavier-than-air  powered aircraft was designed and built
uvbVzutfulU,1986000,1992080,by the wright brothers they flew it four  times  on december 17 1903 near
uvbVzutfulU,1992080,1999679,kiel devil hills about four miles  i believe possibility is destiny
uvbVzutfulU,1999679,2006720,and it is fear that keeps us  arrested and apprehended by the spirit
uvbVzutfulU,2006720,2012080,of impossibility i'm gonna tell you this  right now and nobody else is gonna tell  you this
uvbVzutfulU,2012080,2020080,impossible is a spirit and you've got to  arrest that spirit  or it will arrest you
uvbVzutfulU,2020080,2026240,impossibility is like a soda fountain  the easy way out the path of least
uvbVzutfulU,2026240,2031679,resistance because  to say something is impossible to give  up to cop out
uvbVzutfulU,2031679,2038720,to feel your cup of carbonated excuses  it tastes good  but it doesn't sit well as it goes down
uvbVzutfulU,2038720,2046320,into your system  to remove the two letters is the grit  of existence the binding faith of hope
uvbVzutfulU,2046320,2052320,to your chest and letting your heart  beat you got to rewrite the code you got  to rewrite the script
uvbVzutfulU,2052320,2058638,calling all reformers i'm calling all  innovators i'm calling all game changers
uvbVzutfulU,2058638,2065280,i'm calling all world shakers i'm  calling all  city shifters i'm calling everybody that
uvbVzutfulU,2065280,2070800,has an inkling of faith in themselves  i'm calling everybody
uvbVzutfulU,2071520,2075839,you will inherit the future
uvbVzutfulU,2080960,2086079,we gotta rewrite the code in our soul  because it's a matter of the soul it's a
uvbVzutfulU,2086079,2091919,matter of the will  people that have a will to win are the
uvbVzutfulU,2091919,2097599,ones who who win  these are the people that see the future  these are the people that see not where  the hockey puck
uvbVzutfulU,2097599,2103880,is but they see where the hockey puck is  going that's the type of person that we  all need to evolve to become
uvbVzutfulU,2103880,2110960,[Applause]  i i learned years ago that the  difference between people  that get things done and people that do
uvbVzutfulU,2110960,2116480,not  is sheer willpower
uvbVzutfulU,2116480,2122240,out of all the motivational speeches you  have heard  how much of it have you retained and
uvbVzutfulU,2122240,2128320,applied to your life  because understanding the power and the  difference between what is impossible
uvbVzutfulU,2128320,2136240,and what is possible it all comes back  to your perspective  and your capacity if your why is big
uvbVzutfulU,2136240,2143119,enough  then your will will be powerful enough  to persevere through the how you're not
uvbVzutfulU,2143119,2148160,looking for resources when you have a  will  you become resourceful and that's the
uvbVzutfulU,2148160,2154160,difference between people that see this  thing as possible  and people that do not it comes down to
uvbVzutfulU,2154160,2160079,one thing and that is your will so you  don't want it bad enough  you don't want it bad enough that's why
uvbVzutfulU,2160079,2167839,you can't get it done and so  the how intimidates you and  and and the what boxes you in we're more
uvbVzutfulU,2167839,2173040,concerned about  collaboration than character i think we  need to come back to a place where we're
uvbVzutfulU,2173040,2178240,examining ourselves  as an individual before our people we  make the people better
uvbVzutfulU,2178240,2183520,when we deal with the person you got to  deal with the person you got to deal  with you  it's always going to be impossible to
uvbVzutfulU,2183520,2190560,you if you don't see the power  of your will and the power of your why
uvbVzutfulU,2193839,2200480,the official definition of  self-discipline  is the ability to control one's feelings
uvbVzutfulU,2200480,2206720,and overcome one's weaknesses also  it's the ability to pursue what one
uvbVzutfulU,2206720,2213200,thinks is right  despite temptations to abandon it  [Music]
uvbVzutfulU,2213200,2219200,see the problem with you is you rarely  exercise your self-discipline muscle
uvbVzutfulU,2219200,2226000,you just go with the flow no backbone  whatsoever  and that's perfectly fine until you
uvbVzutfulU,2226000,2231520,start whining and complaining about your  lack of success  [Music]
uvbVzutfulU,2231520,2236640,whining and complaining about your lack  of progress  whining and complaining that you're not
uvbVzutfulU,2236640,2242000,gaining any momentum  and you can't seem to get ahead in life
uvbVzutfulU,2242000,2248320,see self-discipline begins with the  mastery of your thoughts  if you don't control what you think you
uvbVzutfulU,2248320,2253520,can't control what you do  so don't talk to me about your failures
uvbVzutfulU,2253520,2259280,don't talk to me about your setbacks  don't talk to me about the lack of  success you are achieving
uvbVzutfulU,2259280,2266160,because i'm that one i'm the one that  will tell you the exact reason why you  are failing
uvbVzutfulU,2266160,2273280,you're failing because on a daily basis  you failed to exercise your  self-discipline muscle  on a daily basis you fail to sacrifice
uvbVzutfulU,2273280,2281599,your failing because on a daily basis  you failed to come up with the plan on a  daily basis  you fail to get uncomfortable
uvbVzutfulU,2281599,2288000,you fail to push past your limits  and you fail to believe in yourself so
uvbVzutfulU,2288000,2295599,this is the moment that you stop  renting your problems this is the moment  you stop  renting your issues this is the moment
uvbVzutfulU,2295599,2303119,that you stop renting your lack of focus  this is the moment that you stop renting  your lack of self-discipline
uvbVzutfulU,2303119,2309520,it's time for you to take ownership it's  time for you to own the fact that you're  the reason  it's time for you to own the fact that
uvbVzutfulU,2309520,2314720,you're the one that's exercising your  lazy muscle it's time for you to own the  fact  that you're the one that's exercising
uvbVzutfulU,2314720,2321040,your do nothing muscle you're the one  that's exercising your negative mindset  muscle  you're the one that's exercising your no
uvbVzutfulU,2321040,2329119,willpower muscle  but that's okay because so many others
uvbVzutfulU,2329119,2336480,including myself were once in the exact  same place  that you are right now
uvbVzutfulU,2338720,2345200,and then we sat down and had a  heart-to-heart conversation with  ourselves
uvbVzutfulU,2345200,2352480,we self-assessed and took complete  ownership for all of the lack of success
uvbVzutfulU,2352480,2359680,that we were achieving then we made the  decision  to flip the switch and made the
uvbVzutfulU,2359680,2364800,necessary changes  to go into the kitchen of our lives and
uvbVzutfulU,2364800,2370400,cook up a dish of massive success  and we quickly realized that a key
uvbVzutfulU,2370400,2376320,ingredient  is self-discipline see self-discipline
uvbVzutfulU,2376320,2383119,is the bridge between goals and  accomplishment  self-discipline is the magic power that
uvbVzutfulU,2383119,2389280,makes you  virtually unstoppable self-discipline  is the center of the universe for
uvbVzutfulU,2389280,2395119,success  self-discipline is doing within
uvbVzutfulU,2395119,2401680,wow you're doing without and what that  means is when your friends are begging  you to go hang out
uvbVzutfulU,2401680,2406960,and you say no because you're way too  busy  grinding hard to put yourself in
uvbVzutfulU,2406960,2412720,position  to win in your game of life to love this  quote
uvbVzutfulU,2412720,2420720,from the late great zig ziglar he says  when you do the things you ought to do
uvbVzutfulU,2420720,2426560,when you ought to do them the day will  come  when you can do the things that you want
uvbVzutfulU,2426560,2432319,to do when  you want to do them see without
uvbVzutfulU,2432319,2439040,self-discipline  success is not possible period
uvbVzutfulU,2439040,2445760,so i need you to ask yourself do you  have the strength  to say no when so many others say yes
uvbVzutfulU,2445760,2452160,i need you to ask yourself do you have  the strength to keep working when so  many of your friends are playing
uvbVzutfulU,2452160,2459920,i need you to ask yourself do you have  the strength to keep going  when so many others are stopping i need
uvbVzutfulU,2459920,2466079,you to ask yourself  do you have the strength to keep  fighting
uvbVzutfulU,2466079,2472560,when so many others are throwing in the  towel  because if you can answer yes to all of
uvbVzutfulU,2472560,2478240,those questions  you are well on your way to joining the  one percent club
uvbVzutfulU,2478240,2484400,you are well on your way to living the  life of your dreams  so now is the time for you to hit the
uvbVzutfulU,2484400,2490240,gym of your life  and start exercising your  self-discipline muscle
uvbVzutfulU,2490240,2496560,no more talk no more excuses  from this moment forward it's all about
uvbVzutfulU,2496560,2503119,massive execution  will there be days that you don't feel  like it yes
uvbVzutfulU,2503119,2508240,would it be days that you wanted to stop  yes  would it be days that you want to give
uvbVzutfulU,2508240,2515200,up yes  would it be days that you want to quit  yes

uvbVzutfulU,2522640,2530319,and do it anyway because when you push  yourself to do  and you get started you will be amazed
uvbVzutfulU,2530319,2536400,at how all of a sudden you have the  energy you need to get it done sometimes
uvbVzutfulU,2536400,2542400,you have to trick yourself  and say i'm just going to spend five  minutes working on this project
uvbVzutfulU,2542400,2549359,you get started and all of a sudden an  hour later  you not only complete it but you also
uvbVzutfulU,2549359,2556560,feel an amazing sense of pride and  accomplishment  i want you to understand this you will
uvbVzutfulU,2556560,2563680,not always be motivated to do something  so you have to force yourself to be  disciplined because those that are
uvbVzutfulU,2563680,2568800,undisciplined  allow moods appetites passions
uvbVzutfulU,2568800,2575040,and temptation to dominate their lives  but that is no longer who you are

uvbVzutfulU,2616560,2622400,always have self-discipline  because they understand that
uvbVzutfulU,2622400,2628400,self-discipline is about controlling  your desires and  impulses while staying focused on what
uvbVzutfulU,2628400,2635200,needs to get done to achieve your goal  the late great kobe bryant said
uvbVzutfulU,2635200,2641119,i don't understand lazy people we don't  speak the same language
uvbVzutfulU,2641119,2647440,i don't understand you and i don't want  to understand you  see kobe understood that at the center
uvbVzutfulU,2647440,2652880,of bringing any dream  any goal or any success into fruition

uvbVzutfulU,2688319,2694160,with self-discipline  it starts with you
uvbVzutfulU,2694160,2699920,abraham lincoln said discipline is  choosing between what you want now
uvbVzutfulU,2699920,2706960,and what you want most  you only have two options
uvbVzutfulU,2706960,2713359,suffer the pain of discipline  or suffer the pain of regret
uvbVzutfulU,2713359,2719040,the choice is yours
uvbVzutfulU,2719040,2725680,the greatest  do you believe that do you really

uvbVzutfulU,2811359,2817838,but to be great you got to believe in it
uvbVzutfulU,2818880,2826000,since the day you were born greatness  was already there when you had those
uvbVzutfulU,2826000,2833119,hard times  greatness was already there  when nobody thought that you had what it

uvbVzutfulU,2872240,2879119,but you kept doing it anyway you see my  friends  that's an excuse you're looking for a
uvbVzutfulU,2879119,2885440,way out  you're trying to find an idea and saying  hey it's okay for me to keep making this
uvbVzutfulU,2885440,2892160,type of a mistake  it's okay for me to keep saying the same  thing over and over  it's okay for me to sound like a broken
uvbVzutfulU,2892160,2897520,record with a hole in it  but nevertheless i haven't put myself in
uvbVzutfulU,2897520,2904160,a position  to change you know you can do it but you  just don't want to do it

uvbVzutfulU,2927040,2932400,means a lot more  than just changing change is good  but are you changing for the right
uvbVzutfulU,2932400,2937440,reasons or you're in a certain position  where you feel like you have to change
uvbVzutfulU,2937440,2942480,yourself or change who you really are  to please other people that's not the
uvbVzutfulU,2942480,2948000,type of change i'm talking about  i'm talking about for the greater good

uvbVzutfulU,2954800,2960480,difference in your life  you can't keep doing the same thing over
uvbVzutfulU,2960480,2966160,and over and over again  and you're not getting anywhere you're  not committed
uvbVzutfulU,2966160,2972000,you're not doing the right things  instead you keep doing the wrong things  and you're looking for someone to rescue

uvbVzutfulU,3197760,3202880,my life where i didn't have a faith in  myself  where i didn't believe in myself then i
uvbVzutfulU,3202880,3212000,began to pick myself up  dust myself off so and i asked the  question  what is it that continues to drive you

uvbVzutfulU,3286240,3293200,and nothing gonna change if nothing  change so you have to take action  and when i say take action you have to
uvbVzutfulU,3293200,3298640,self-assess and say  it is you versus you  [Music]
uvbVzutfulU,3298640,3304319,when you can look in the mirror and you  can say to yourself i didn't study  i woke up late when you can say it's me

uvbVzutfulU,3312400,3318000,you begin to grow and you don't kill the  pointed fingers that nobody
uvbVzutfulU,3319280,3325520,man i remember i was stripped of  everything i owned
uvbVzutfulU,3325520,3333119,from apartments the cars  everything i came in contact with
uvbVzutfulU,3333119,3341280,i mean i was stripped of  but all through through them storms
uvbVzutfulU,3341280,3347599,them trousered them tribulations i began  to soar like an evil see  the eagle is one of the only birds that
uvbVzutfulU,3347599,3353440,when a storm is coming  he doesn't fly away but he flies into  the storm
uvbVzutfulU,3353839,3360720,and he uses the pressures of the storm  to soar  we're using very little energy
uvbVzutfulU,3360720,3367920,to soar above the storm to to rise  to an atmosphere of peace and security
uvbVzutfulU,3367920,3373440,don't you want to soar  [Music]

uvbVzutfulU,3378960,3385200,storm to soar  above everybody that told you you  couldn't do what you doing
uvbVzutfulU,3385520,3392079,and what drives you  because it don't matter how hard you go
uvbVzutfulU,3392079,3398960,when you on a journey  to go get what's yours you will

uvbVzutfulU,4441040,4447440,stuck in your disappointment  instead of focusing on how unfair your
uvbVzutfulU,4447440,4452480,situation is  i'm challenging you to use your  frustration
uvbVzutfulU,4452480,4461040,to push you harder i want you to know  that you are not finished

uvbVzutfulU,4482320,4488320,wiser version of yourself  and for someone who is listening right
uvbVzutfulU,4488320,4493600,now  you are feeling discouraged you're  feeling discouraged
uvbVzutfulU,4493600,4499679,because of what you've lost  but i want you to know that what you
uvbVzutfulU,4499679,4507679,have  left is all you need  to rebuild i'm going to say that again

uvbVzutfulU,4517020,4522080,[Music]
uvbVzutfulU,4522080,4529360,your brokenness signifies a new  beginning this is a new beginning for
uvbVzutfulU,4529360,4536400,you  so this is not the time for you to slack  off  this is not the time for you to go to
uvbVzutfulU,4536400,4543440,your  unhealthy coping mechanism  whatever that is for you
uvbVzutfulU,4543440,4549600,this is not the time for you to go into  your room  turn off the lights and pull the covers
uvbVzutfulU,4549600,4557440,over your head  this is the time for you to go into  warrior mode
uvbVzutfulU,4557440,4564480,the dreams that you have are not going  to fall into your lap  we all want that we all want the easy
uvbVzutfulU,4564480,4570719,route  we all want it to happen fast  but the truth is that you've got to be
uvbVzutfulU,4570719,4577040,willing to fight for what you want  and sometimes the person that you have
uvbVzutfulU,4577040,4584400,to check  is yourself yes  you heard that correctly you have to
uvbVzutfulU,4584400,4589679,check  yourself because your dreams cannot  become a reality
uvbVzutfulU,4589679,4596400,without you you have to be confident  in you you have to believe
uvbVzutfulU,4596400,4603600,that you have what it takes you have to  declutter  your mind you have to make sure that you
uvbVzutfulU,4603600,4610880,are  managing yourself wisely that you are  making the right decisions you have to
uvbVzutfulU,4610880,4617440,make sure  that you keep the promises that you have  made to yourself
uvbVzutfulU,4617679,4626239,you have to envision what you want and  refuse to let go  until you get it
uvbVzutfulU,4626239,4631440,so what is going to enable you to finish  well there's a lot that goes into
uvbVzutfulU,4631440,4636480,achieving your goals so i don't want to  make it sound like it's simple but i can
uvbVzutfulU,4636480,4642159,tell you this  without extreme focus and tenacity
uvbVzutfulU,4642159,4649040,you will do a whole lot of starting  but very little finishing
uvbVzutfulU,4649040,4656960,so take note of this finishing  requires focus and you might even have
uvbVzutfulU,4656960,4662640,to repeat that to yourself  finishing requires focus
uvbVzutfulU,4662640,4670080,it's easy to become distracted  especially with all of the chaos  that's going on in the world right now
uvbVzutfulU,4670080,4676320,but you have work to do  and so it's important that you keep your  focus in the right place
uvbVzutfulU,4676320,4683440,it's important that you keep working  towards crossing  the finish line
uvbVzutfulU,4683920,4692880,the easiest way to sink into a state of  depression  is to become consumed by your problems
uvbVzutfulU,4692880,4699760,there's a difference between being aware  of your problems  and being consumed by them
uvbVzutfulU,4699760,4706080,so if your problems are all that you  seem to think about  your focus is in the wrong place it's
uvbVzutfulU,4706080,4712560,going to be up to you to recognize when  it's time  to shift your focus and so whenever your
uvbVzutfulU,4712560,4717600,mind tries to take you to a place that  pulls you into a state of despair
uvbVzutfulU,4717600,4724960,you got to shift your focus when you  entertain  negative thoughts it's like being in
uvbVzutfulU,4724960,4732000,quicksand before you even realize it  you can go from having a simple negative
uvbVzutfulU,4732000,4739040,thought  to feeling discouraged and this  doesn't take a long time it can happen
uvbVzutfulU,4739040,4748930,in a matter  of minutes
