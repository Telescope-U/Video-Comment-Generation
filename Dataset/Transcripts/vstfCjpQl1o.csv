vstfCjpQl1o,174840,178080,game wood pitches and a slider swung on
vstfCjpQl1o,178080,180420,and missed strike three so he got the
vstfCjpQl1o,180420,182940,one ground ball and then right back into

vstfCjpQl1o,195780,198120,that was a double play and it looked
vstfCjpQl1o,198120,199560,like he was headed to Second a little
vstfCjpQl1o,199560,201500,early
vstfCjpQl1o,201500,205739,Jam shot Baez has to worry about the
vstfCjpQl1o,205739,207599,back and he couldn't make a play
vstfCjpQl1o,207599,209340,unbelievable I don't know if I've ever
vstfCjpQl1o,209340,210959,seen that I have not ever seen that
vstfCjpQl1o,210959,212400,before

vstfCjpQl1o,216780,218940,coming at him just a great pitch by
vstfCjpQl1o,218940,220200,Garcia
vstfCjpQl1o,220200,222239,and then Mikey stepped on the back and
vstfCjpQl1o,222239,224040,then he steps on the bat his foot gives
vstfCjpQl1o,224040,225540,away and he winds up having to eat it
vstfCjpQl1o,225540,227340,Ronnie Garcia's got to be thinking what
vstfCjpQl1o,227340,229140,the heck is going on
vstfCjpQl1o,229140,231060,this ending's working against me
vstfCjpQl1o,231060,233099,back comes back into play and here he
vstfCjpQl1o,233099,236700,takes a shuffle step and steps on it

vstfCjpQl1o,262199,265440,the right fielder Lamont Wade Baez into
vstfCjpQl1o,265440,268199,second he will hit it and burn toward
vstfCjpQl1o,268199,271199,third and his pop-up slide brings him in
