99iFAW9fvh8,880,3199,in all my years in uniform
99iFAW9fvh8,3199,4560,i haven't known
99iFAW9fvh8,4560,7040,such a clear threat to the principles of
99iFAW9fvh8,7040,8960,sovereignty and democracy
99iFAW9fvh8,8960,11280,and the freedom to live without fear of
99iFAW9fvh8,11280,13920,violence as the brutal aggression of
99iFAW9fvh8,13920,15440,president putin
99iFAW9fvh8,15440,18240,and his expansionist ambitions
99iFAW9fvh8,18240,20240,i believe we're living through a history
99iFAW9fvh8,20240,22400,a period of history as profound as the
99iFAW9fvh8,22400,25840,one our forebears did 80 years ago and
99iFAW9fvh8,25840,28840,now as then our choices will have a
99iFAW9fvh8,28840,32238,disproportionate effect on the future
99iFAW9fvh8,32238,35280,this is our 1937 moment
99iFAW9fvh8,35280,36800,we're not at war
99iFAW9fvh8,36800,38879,but we must act rapidly so that we
99iFAW9fvh8,38879,41680,aren't drawn into one through a failure
99iFAW9fvh8,41680,45039,to contain territorial expansion
99iFAW9fvh8,45039,47520,so surely it's beholden on each of us to
99iFAW9fvh8,47520,49600,ensure that we never find ourselves
99iFAW9fvh8,49600,52239,asking that futile question
99iFAW9fvh8,52239,54239,should we have done more
99iFAW9fvh8,54239,56719,i'll do everything in my power to ensure
99iFAW9fvh8,56719,59280,that the british army plays its part in
99iFAW9fvh8,59280,60719,averting war
99iFAW9fvh8,60719,62079,i will have an answer to my
99iFAW9fvh8,62079,64559,grandchildren should they ever ask what
99iFAW9fvh8,64559,67920,i did in 2022
99iFAW9fvh8,67920,70479,so we have agency to prevent war now
99iFAW9fvh8,70479,73520,but only if we take a new approach
99iFAW9fvh8,73520,75600,now these are extraordinary times
99iFAW9fvh8,75600,77920,so i won't take the usual approach of a
99iFAW9fvh8,77920,80000,new cgs to this event
99iFAW9fvh8,80000,82479,it will not be the traditional
99iFAW9fvh8,82479,84560,tour of the horizon covering the full
99iFAW9fvh8,84560,87040,breadth of army business
99iFAW9fvh8,87040,90560,i'll concentrate on one area alone how i
99iFAW9fvh8,90560,93680,intend to mobilize the british army our
99iFAW9fvh8,93680,94720,regulars
99iFAW9fvh8,94720,97040,our reservists and our civilians to
99iFAW9fvh8,97040,99280,deter russian aggression
99iFAW9fvh8,99280,100960,to prevent war
99iFAW9fvh8,100960,103040,now we're already a busy army but
99iFAW9fvh8,103040,105439,today's about mobilization and to
99iFAW9fvh8,105439,108000,mobilize effectively we will need to
99iFAW9fvh8,108000,109040,suppress
99iFAW9fvh8,109040,111439,our additive culture and to guard
99iFAW9fvh8,111439,114799,against the tyranny of and we can't do
99iFAW9fvh8,114799,116000,everything well
99iFAW9fvh8,116000,117280,and some things are going to have to
99iFAW9fvh8,117280,119439,stop it will mean ruthless
99iFAW9fvh8,119439,121520,prioritization
99iFAW9fvh8,121520,123040,so from now the army will have a
99iFAW9fvh8,123040,125840,singular focus to mobilize to meet
99iFAW9fvh8,125840,128239,today's threat and thereby prevent war
99iFAW9fvh8,128239,130399,in europe
99iFAW9fvh8,130399,132319,this is not the rush to war at the speed
99iFAW9fvh8,132319,135440,of the railway timetables of 1914
99iFAW9fvh8,135440,138480,it is instead an acceleration of the
99iFAW9fvh8,138480,140239,most important parts
99iFAW9fvh8,140239,142480,of future soldiers bold modernization
99iFAW9fvh8,142480,144000,agenda
99iFAW9fvh8,144000,147120,a move to a positional strategy
99iFAW9fvh8,147120,149120,an increased focus on readiness and
99iFAW9fvh8,149120,151120,combined arms training
99iFAW9fvh8,151120,153840,and a broader institutional renewal that
99iFAW9fvh8,153840,156319,creates the culture required to win if
99iFAW9fvh8,156319,157760,called upon
99iFAW9fvh8,157760,159599,this process we'll give it a name
99iFAW9fvh8,159599,162080,operation mobilize will be the army's
99iFAW9fvh8,162080,165920,primary focus over the coming years
99iFAW9fvh8,165920,168160,so why do we need to mobilize
99iFAW9fvh8,168160,169760,well under the leadership of the prime
99iFAW9fvh8,169760,170800,minister
99iFAW9fvh8,170800,173040,and the defense secretary the united
99iFAW9fvh8,173040,176000,kingdom has risen to meet russia's
99iFAW9fvh8,176000,177360,aggression
99iFAW9fvh8,177360,180000,defence has worked at a phenomenal pace
99iFAW9fvh8,180000,181599,to bring together a coalition of
99iFAW9fvh8,181599,184239,partners to provide material
99iFAW9fvh8,184239,187120,intelligence and training to sustain
99iFAW9fvh8,187120,189920,ukraine in its fight against the russian
99iFAW9fvh8,189920,191280,invaders
99iFAW9fvh8,191280,193599,our bilateral relationship with kiev has
99iFAW9fvh8,193599,195680,gone from strength to strength
99iFAW9fvh8,195680,198319,this year alone we have supplied nine
99iFAW9fvh8,198319,200720,and a half thousand anti-tank missiles
99iFAW9fvh8,200720,203920,of which over five thousand were endless
99iFAW9fvh8,203920,206319,we've already provided uk-based training
99iFAW9fvh8,206319,209840,for 650 armed forces of ukraine soldiers
99iFAW9fvh8,209840,211680,and in the coming months the british
99iFAW9fvh8,211680,214159,army will deliver battle winning skills
99iFAW9fvh8,214159,216480,to a further ten thousand it's just
99iFAW9fvh8,216480,218159,starting
99iFAW9fvh8,218159,220799,the upcoming madrid summit tomorrow
99iFAW9fvh8,220799,223440,is a timely opportunity to demonstrate
99iFAW9fvh8,223440,225840,our leadership in nato and our enduring
99iFAW9fvh8,225840,227840,commitment to our allies
99iFAW9fvh8,227840,230879,mobilizing the army to prevent war is as
99iFAW9fvh8,230879,232799,tangible and concrete an act of
99iFAW9fvh8,232799,235200,leadership as i can offer
99iFAW9fvh8,235200,238400,the uk will lead by example
99iFAW9fvh8,238400,240400,now it's dangerous to assume that
99iFAW9fvh8,240400,242720,ukraine is a limited conflict
99iFAW9fvh8,242720,244720,one of its obvious lessons is that
99iFAW9fvh8,244720,246720,putin's calculations don't always follow
99iFAW9fvh8,246720,248159,our own logic
99iFAW9fvh8,248159,249840,it's also worth remembering that
99iFAW9fvh8,249840,252840,historically russia often starts wars
99iFAW9fvh8,252840,256320,badly and because russia wages war at
99iFAW9fvh8,256320,257759,the strategic
99iFAW9fvh8,257759,260239,and not the tactical level its depth and
99iFAW9fvh8,260239,262720,resilience means it can suffer any
99iFAW9fvh8,262720,265120,number of campaigns battles and
99iFAW9fvh8,265120,266639,engagements lost
99iFAW9fvh8,266639,269520,and yet regenerate and still ultimately
99iFAW9fvh8,269520,271199,prevail
99iFAW9fvh8,271199,273120,history has also shown us
99iFAW9fvh8,273120,275600,that armies that have tasted defeat
99iFAW9fvh8,275600,277759,learn more quickly
99iFAW9fvh8,277759,279280,and while russia's conventional
99iFAW9fvh8,279280,281600,capability will be much reduced for a
99iFAW9fvh8,281600,282800,time at least
99iFAW9fvh8,282800,284800,putin's declared intent
99iFAW9fvh8,284800,287199,recently to restore the lands of
99iFAW9fvh8,287199,288880,historic russia
99iFAW9fvh8,288880,291280,makes any respite temporary
99iFAW9fvh8,291280,293040,and the threat will become even more
99iFAW9fvh8,293040,294400,acute
99iFAW9fvh8,294400,295520,we don't know
99iFAW9fvh8,295520,297759,how the war in ukraine will end but in
99iFAW9fvh8,297759,299919,most scenarios russia will be an even
99iFAW9fvh8,299919,302479,greater threat to european security
99iFAW9fvh8,302479,305759,after ukraine than it was before
99iFAW9fvh8,305759,307600,the russian invasion has reminded us of
99iFAW9fvh8,307600,309520,that time honored maxim that if you want
99iFAW9fvh8,309520,311759,to avert conflict you better be prepared
99iFAW9fvh8,311759,313280,to fight
99iFAW9fvh8,313280,315039,so this is the challenge
99iFAW9fvh8,315039,317120,that i will address through mobilization
99iFAW9fvh8,317120,319680,and to make it crystal clear that means
99iFAW9fvh8,319680,322479,focusing on winning the war working with
99iFAW9fvh8,322479,325199,these allies against this threat in this
99iFAW9fvh8,325199,327919,location and we'll see the first orders
99iFAW9fvh8,327919,331039,issued in madrid tomorrow
99iFAW9fvh8,331039,332960,now this threat's also materialized at a
99iFAW9fvh8,332960,334960,time when the world is already looking
99iFAW9fvh8,334960,336880,less secure the viewpoint set out
99iFAW9fvh8,336880,340080,clearly in last year's integrated review
99iFAW9fvh8,340080,342080,and defense command paper
99iFAW9fvh8,342080,344880,in meeting a revanchist russia we can't
99iFAW9fvh8,344880,347840,be guilty of myopically chasing the ball
99iFAW9fvh8,347840,350560,defense cannot ignore the exponential
99iFAW9fvh8,350560,353600,rise and chronic challenge of china
99iFAW9fvh8,353600,355919,not just within the south china sea but
99iFAW9fvh8,355919,357840,through sub-threshold activities across
99iFAW9fvh8,357840,359120,the globe
99iFAW9fvh8,359120,361280,beijing will be watching our response to
99iFAW9fvh8,361280,363280,moscow's actions carefully
99iFAW9fvh8,363280,366080,but ceding more territory to putin could
99iFAW9fvh8,366080,368560,prove a fatal blow to the principle of
99iFAW9fvh8,368560,370400,national sovereignty that has
99iFAW9fvh8,370400,371759,underpinned the international order
99iFAW9fvh8,371759,373759,since 1945
99iFAW9fvh8,373759,376160,and we can't allow nato states
99iFAW9fvh8,376160,378160,to live with the grim reality
99iFAW9fvh8,378160,380639,of the human cost of occupation that we
99iFAW9fvh8,380639,383039,see in front of us
99iFAW9fvh8,383039,384560,now given the commitments of the united
99iFAW9fvh8,384560,387440,states in asia during the 20s and the
99iFAW9fvh8,387440,388800,30s
99iFAW9fvh8,388800,390000,i believe that the burden for
99iFAW9fvh8,390000,392080,conventional deterrence in europe will
99iFAW9fvh8,392080,394319,fall increasingly to european members of
99iFAW9fvh8,394319,396240,nato and the jeff
99iFAW9fvh8,396240,398560,and this is right in my view taking up
99iFAW9fvh8,398560,401120,the burden in europe means we can free
99iFAW9fvh8,401120,403840,more u.s resources to ensure that our
99iFAW9fvh8,403840,406240,values and interests are protected in
99iFAW9fvh8,406240,408240,the indo-pacific
99iFAW9fvh8,408240,409759,and we're not alone in facing this
99iFAW9fvh8,409759,410800,reality
99iFAW9fvh8,410800,412800,looking out at you here today i'm
99iFAW9fvh8,412800,415199,reassured by the number of allies and
99iFAW9fvh8,415199,417039,partners i see before me
99iFAW9fvh8,417039,419199,the faces of friends from previous
99iFAW9fvh8,419199,421360,campaigns where we've shared hardship
99iFAW9fvh8,421360,424160,and laughter failures and victories
99iFAW9fvh8,424160,425919,we've shed blood together
99iFAW9fvh8,425919,429039,we remember those we left behind
99iFAW9fvh8,429039,430960,and it's this our willingness to shed
99iFAW9fvh8,430960,432000,blood
99iFAW9fvh8,432000,434000,to protect common values and each
99iFAW9fvh8,434000,435680,other's territory that will see us
99iFAW9fvh8,435680,437759,prevail
99iFAW9fvh8,437759,439840,so how are we going to mobilize
99iFAW9fvh8,439840,442880,well article 5 remains the cornerstone
99iFAW9fvh8,442880,445120,of our national security it makes it a
99iFAW9fvh8,445120,447280,critical national interest
99iFAW9fvh8,447280,450639,the conflict in ukraine or held i think
99iFAW9fvh8,450639,453120,a paradigm shift in how nato delivers
99iFAW9fvh8,453120,455360,collective deterrence from a doctrine of
99iFAW9fvh8,455360,457840,reacting to crises to one of deterring
99iFAW9fvh8,457840,458720,them
99iFAW9fvh8,458720,460479,and this principle is at the heart of
99iFAW9fvh8,460479,462800,opmobilize russia knowing that they
99iFAW9fvh8,462800,465440,cannot gain a quick localized victory
99iFAW9fvh8,465440,468160,but in any circumstances and in any time
99iFAW9fvh8,468160,470400,frame they will lose if they pick a
99iFAW9fvh8,470400,473120,fight with nato
99iFAW9fvh8,473120,475280,deterrence demands all the tools of
99iFAW9fvh8,475280,477360,statecraft underpinned by soldiers
99iFAW9fvh8,477360,480240,sailors aviators and civil servants
99iFAW9fvh8,480240,482800,operating across all five operational
99iFAW9fvh8,482800,484160,domains
99iFAW9fvh8,484160,487039,it requires forces across defense that
99iFAW9fvh8,487039,489039,are modernized relevant and harness the
99iFAW9fvh8,489039,490800,potential of the fourth industrial
99iFAW9fvh8,490800,493360,revolution effective deterrence also
99iFAW9fvh8,493360,495280,means communicating clearly so we
99iFAW9fvh8,495280,497360,maximize deterrent effects without
99iFAW9fvh8,497360,501360,increasing the risk of mobilization
99iFAW9fvh8,501440,503440,but when faced with an adversary such as
99iFAW9fvh8,503440,506080,mr putin with the campaigns of peter the
99iFAW9fvh8,506080,508319,great as his reference point
99iFAW9fvh8,508319,510000,the war in ukraine
99iFAW9fvh8,510000,512479,also reminds us of the utility
99iFAW9fvh8,512479,514000,of land power
99iFAW9fvh8,514000,516800,it takes an army to hold and regain
99iFAW9fvh8,516800,518959,territory and defend the people who live
99iFAW9fvh8,518959,522080,there it takes an army to deter
99iFAW9fvh8,522080,525040,and this army the british army will play
99iFAW9fvh8,525040,528480,its part alongside our allies
99iFAW9fvh8,528480,529680,and in ukraine we've seen the
99iFAW9fvh8,529680,532560,limitations of deterrence by punishment
99iFAW9fvh8,532560,534399,it's reinforced the importance of
99iFAW9fvh8,534399,536080,deterrence through denial
99iFAW9fvh8,536080,538640,we must stop russia seizing territory
99iFAW9fvh8,538640,540560,rather than expecting to respond to a
99iFAW9fvh8,540560,542560,land grab with the delayed
99iFAW9fvh8,542560,544880,counter-offensive
99iFAW9fvh8,544880,547360,to succeed the british army in
99iFAW9fvh8,547360,549200,conjunction with our nato allies and
99iFAW9fvh8,549200,552240,partners must be in place or as
99iFAW9fvh8,552240,554320,especially high readiness ideally a mix
99iFAW9fvh8,554320,555360,of both
99iFAW9fvh8,555360,556720,tripwires
99iFAW9fvh8,556720,558080,aren't enough
99iFAW9fvh8,558080,559760,if we fail to deter
99iFAW9fvh8,559760,562000,there are no good choices given the cost
99iFAW9fvh8,562000,564160,of a potential counter-attack and the
99iFAW9fvh8,564160,566240,associated nuclear threat
99iFAW9fvh8,566240,567839,we must therefore meet strength with
99iFAW9fvh8,567839,570160,strength from the outset and be
99iFAW9fvh8,570160,572800,unequivocally prepared to fight for nato
99iFAW9fvh8,572800,575120,territory
99iFAW9fvh8,575120,577040,now if this battle came
99iFAW9fvh8,577040,578800,we would likely be outnumbered at the
99iFAW9fvh8,578800,580080,point of attack
99iFAW9fvh8,580080,582080,and fighting like hell
99iFAW9fvh8,582080,585760,standoff air maritime or cyber fires are
99iFAW9fvh8,585760,588160,unlikely to dominate on their own
99iFAW9fvh8,588160,591200,land will still be the decisive domain
99iFAW9fvh8,591200,593120,and though i bow to no one
99iFAW9fvh8,593120,595120,in my advocacy for the need for
99iFAW9fvh8,595120,597680,game-changing digital transformation to
99iFAW9fvh8,597680,599920,put it bluntly you can't cyber your way
99iFAW9fvh8,599920,602160,across a river
99iFAW9fvh8,602160,605120,no single platform capability or tactic
99iFAW9fvh8,605120,607360,will unlock the problem
99iFAW9fvh8,607360,609440,success will be determined by combined
99iFAW9fvh8,609440,612800,arms and multi-domain competence and
99iFAW9fvh8,612800,613920,mass
99iFAW9fvh8,613920,615920,ukraine has also shown
99iFAW9fvh8,615920,618480,that engaging with our adversaries and
99iFAW9fvh8,618480,620320,training assisting and reassuring our
99iFAW9fvh8,620320,621360,partners
99iFAW9fvh8,621360,623600,is high payoff activity
99iFAW9fvh8,623600,625600,future soldiers new ranger regiment on
99iFAW9fvh8,625600,627279,the ground in ukraine before the
99iFAW9fvh8,627279,629519,invasion and the new security force
99iFAW9fvh8,629519,631760,assistance brigade are well set for this
99iFAW9fvh8,631760,633440,with the right partner and in the right
99iFAW9fvh8,633440,634560,conditions
99iFAW9fvh8,634560,636160,persistent engagement and capacity
99iFAW9fvh8,636160,638720,building can be really effective
99iFAW9fvh8,638720,640720,operational orbital has made a key
99iFAW9fvh8,640720,643040,contribution to preparing the armed
99iFAW9fvh8,643040,645440,forces of ukraine for this fight and it
99iFAW9fvh8,645440,648480,continues to expand exponentially
99iFAW9fvh8,648480,650880,and we should be wary of russia's malign
99iFAW9fvh8,650880,653600,activities further afield so our global
99iFAW9fvh8,653600,656240,hubs including kenya and oman will still
99iFAW9fvh8,656240,659040,play a vital role as we seek to mobilize
99iFAW9fvh8,659040,661279,to meet aggression in europe allowing us
99iFAW9fvh8,661279,663360,to help our partners there secure
99iFAW9fvh8,663360,665360,strategic advantage
99iFAW9fvh8,665360,668000,elsewhere in the world
99iFAW9fvh8,668000,669920,this is the war that we are mobilizing
99iFAW9fvh8,669920,670959,to prevent
99iFAW9fvh8,670959,673600,by preparing to win with our nato and
99iFAW9fvh8,673600,674959,jeff partners
99iFAW9fvh8,674959,677040,against the russian threat
99iFAW9fvh8,677040,680160,in eastern and northern europe
99iFAW9fvh8,680160,682560,and in doing so it's my hope that we
99iFAW9fvh8,682560,685600,never have to fight it
99iFAW9fvh8,685760,688320,so what does this mean for the army well
99iFAW9fvh8,688320,691040,my predecessor and my friend general sir
99iFAW9fvh8,691040,693600,mark carlton smith laid the foundations
99iFAW9fvh8,693600,696079,for the most ambitious transformation
99iFAW9fvh8,696079,698640,of the british army in a generation
99iFAW9fvh8,698640,702640,future soldier we i owe him a great debt
99iFAW9fvh8,702640,704240,the government has also generously
99iFAW9fvh8,704240,707440,committed 41 billion to army equipment
99iFAW9fvh8,707440,709360,over the next decade
99iFAW9fvh8,709360,711839,but as we face a new reality a race to
99iFAW9fvh8,711839,713040,mobilize
99iFAW9fvh8,713040,715120,we must be honest with ourselves about
99iFAW9fvh8,715120,717200,future soldiers timelines
99iFAW9fvh8,717200,720160,capability gaps and risks
99iFAW9fvh8,720160,722880,and now our own diminished stockpiles as
99iFAW9fvh8,722880,725440,a result of gifting in kind to the brave
99iFAW9fvh8,725440,728079,soldiers of the armed forces of ukraine
99iFAW9fvh8,728079,729760,so we shouldn't be afraid of necessary
99iFAW9fvh8,729760,731040,heresies
99iFAW9fvh8,731040,733040,defense is only as strong as its weakest
99iFAW9fvh8,733040,734000,domain
99iFAW9fvh8,734000,736000,and technology doesn't eliminate the
99iFAW9fvh8,736000,738480,relevance of combat mass
99iFAW9fvh8,738480,740720,so to mobilize the army
99iFAW9fvh8,740720,743360,i'm going to drive activity across four
99iFAW9fvh8,743360,745680,focused lines of effort
99iFAW9fvh8,745680,747680,first and most importantly boosting
99iFAW9fvh8,747680,749200,readiness
99iFAW9fvh8,749200,751680,nato needs high reading forces that can
99iFAW9fvh8,751680,753040,deploy at short notice for the
99iFAW9fvh8,753040,756000,collective defense of alliance members
99iFAW9fvh8,756000,758480,deterring russia means more of the army
99iFAW9fvh8,758480,760639,ready more of the time
99iFAW9fvh8,760639,762800,and ready for high-intensity war in
99iFAW9fvh8,762800,764079,europe
99iFAW9fvh8,764079,765920,so we'll pick up the pace of combined
99iFAW9fvh8,765920,769120,arms training and major on urban combat
99iFAW9fvh8,769120,771519,we'll rebuild our stockpiles and review
99iFAW9fvh8,771519,773920,the deployability of our vehicle fleets
99iFAW9fvh8,773920,775360,and having seen its limitations
99iFAW9fvh8,775360,778160,firsthand as commander field army
99iFAW9fvh8,778160,779760,i think we need to ask ourselves where
99iFAW9fvh8,779760,781600,the whole fleet management is the right
99iFAW9fvh8,781600,783519,model given the scale of the threat that
99iFAW9fvh8,783519,784639,we face
99iFAW9fvh8,784639,787839,the time has come to be frank about our
99iFAW9fvh8,787839,791519,ability to fight if called upon
99iFAW9fvh8,791519,794160,second will accelerate the modernization
99iFAW9fvh8,794160,796959,outlined in future soldier
99iFAW9fvh8,796959,799040,nato needs technologically advanced
99iFAW9fvh8,799040,801680,modern armies able to deploy at speed
99iFAW9fvh8,801680,803360,and fight together
99iFAW9fvh8,803360,805440,they must be able to integrate effects
99iFAW9fvh8,805440,806959,across the domains
99iFAW9fvh8,806959,809680,all stitched together by sophisticated
99iFAW9fvh8,809680,812000,and robust command
99iFAW9fvh8,812000,815680,control and communication network
99iFAW9fvh8,815680,817920,we'll seek to speed up the delivery of
99iFAW9fvh8,817920,820160,plan new equipments
99iFAW9fvh8,820160,822240,including long-range fires attack
99iFAW9fvh8,822240,824560,aviation persistent surveillance and
99iFAW9fvh8,824560,826160,target acquisition
99iFAW9fvh8,826160,829040,expeditionary logistic enablers
99iFAW9fvh8,829040,830880,ground-based air defense
99iFAW9fvh8,830880,832639,protective mobility
99iFAW9fvh8,832639,834320,and the technologies that will prove
99iFAW9fvh8,834320,837920,pivotal to our digital ambition cis and
99iFAW9fvh8,837920,840000,electronic warfare
99iFAW9fvh8,840000,842079,most importantly this will start now and
99iFAW9fvh8,842079,844880,not at some ill defined point in the
99iFAW9fvh8,844880,847279,future
99iFAW9fvh8,847360,848320,third
99iFAW9fvh8,848320,850880,we'll rethink how we fight
99iFAW9fvh8,850880,852320,we've been watching the war in ukraine
99iFAW9fvh8,852320,854560,closely and we're already learning and
99iFAW9fvh8,854560,858240,adapting not least to the help of rusa
99iFAW9fvh8,858240,860480,many of the lessons are not new but they
99iFAW9fvh8,860480,862000,are now applied
99iFAW9fvh8,862000,863600,so we'll double down on combined arms
99iFAW9fvh8,863600,866480,maneuver especially in the deep battle
99iFAW9fvh8,866480,868880,and we'll devise a new doctrine rooted
99iFAW9fvh8,868880,871680,in geography integrated with nato's war
99iFAW9fvh8,871680,874399,plans and specific enough to drive
99iFAW9fvh8,874399,877600,focused relevant investment and inspire
99iFAW9fvh8,877600,879839,the imagination of our people to fight
99iFAW9fvh8,879839,882880,and win if called upon
99iFAW9fvh8,882880,886000,and fourth i am prepared to look again
99iFAW9fvh8,886000,889040,at the structure of our army if we judge
99iFAW9fvh8,889040,890720,the revised structures will make the
99iFAW9fvh8,890720,893440,army better prepared to fight in europe
99iFAW9fvh8,893440,895199,then we'll follow monty's advice and do
99iFAW9fvh8,895199,896880,something else
99iFAW9fvh8,896880,898880,now of course adapting structures has
99iFAW9fvh8,898880,901600,implications for the size of the army
99iFAW9fvh8,901600,903760,and i know that there will be questions
99iFAW9fvh8,903760,905680,on army numbers lock loaded and ready to
99iFAW9fvh8,905680,907839,fire from the audience
99iFAW9fvh8,907839,909120,put simply
99iFAW9fvh8,909120,911440,the threat has changed and as the threat
99iFAW9fvh8,911440,913760,changes will change with it
99iFAW9fvh8,913760,915600,my job is to build the best army
99iFAW9fvh8,915600,918240,possible ready to integrate with fellow
99iFAW9fvh8,918240,920720,services and strategic command and ready
99iFAW9fvh8,920720,923680,to fight alongside our allies
99iFAW9fvh8,923680,926560,nonetheless it would be perverse if the
99iFAW9fvh8,926560,929040,cgs was advocating reducing the size of
99iFAW9fvh8,929040,931759,the army as a land war rages in europe
99iFAW9fvh8,931759,934320,and putin's territorial ambitions extend
99iFAW9fvh8,934320,936160,into the rest of the decade
99iFAW9fvh8,936160,939720,and beyond ukraine
99iFAW9fvh8,940160,942240,importantly the four mechanisms i've
99iFAW9fvh8,942240,944240,used to illustrate how the army will
99iFAW9fvh8,944240,946399,mobilize will all be initiated from the
99iFAW9fvh8,946399,948720,line of march this means now
99iFAW9fvh8,948720,951519,rather than some distant undefined point
99iFAW9fvh8,951519,953680,in the future
99iFAW9fvh8,953680,955920,and not mobilize is as much about people
99iFAW9fvh8,955920,958160,as it is about training and hardware
99iFAW9fvh8,958160,961440,the last 125 days of conflict in ukraine
99iFAW9fvh8,961440,962880,have shown us
99iFAW9fvh8,962880,964880,if we needed showing the enduring nature
99iFAW9fvh8,964880,968160,of war it's violent and human nature and
99iFAW9fvh8,968160,970240,its timeless interplay of friction and
99iFAW9fvh8,970240,971199,chance
99iFAW9fvh8,971199,973040,it's reminded us all that war
99iFAW9fvh8,973040,976639,fundamentally remains a clash of wills
99iFAW9fvh8,976639,978560,russia's so-called special military
99iFAW9fvh8,978560,979600,operation
99iFAW9fvh8,979600,981759,has shown that while moscow may have
99iFAW9fvh8,981759,983440,invested in some of the most modernized
99iFAW9fvh8,983440,985279,land technology in the world
99iFAW9fvh8,985279,987120,it lacked the will to fight
99iFAW9fvh8,987120,989199,when faced with a tenacious ukrainian
99iFAW9fvh8,989199,990560,defense
99iFAW9fvh8,990560,992399,let down by its leaders
99iFAW9fvh8,992399,994480,we've seen the moral decay of the
99iFAW9fvh8,994480,998160,russian army play out in front of us
99iFAW9fvh8,998160,1000240,the fighting spirit of our people is the
99iFAW9fvh8,1000240,1001759,army's greatest single greatest
99iFAW9fvh8,1001759,1003199,responsibility
99iFAW9fvh8,1003199,1005120,the moral component of fighting power
99iFAW9fvh8,1005120,1006240,matters
99iFAW9fvh8,1006240,1008959,to succeed in mobilizing we've got to
99iFAW9fvh8,1008959,1010880,ensure that we engender the culture and
99iFAW9fvh8,1010880,1013440,the behavior required to forge and
99iFAW9fvh8,1013440,1016240,cohere a confident and winning team and
99iFAW9fvh8,1016240,1018880,in my 37 years experience i've learned
99iFAW9fvh8,1018880,1021680,that trust increases tempo
99iFAW9fvh8,1021680,1023920,so i'm fully behind the teamwork
99iFAW9fvh8,1023920,1025120,initiative
99iFAW9fvh8,1025120,1027120,set up by my predecessor
99iFAW9fvh8,1027120,1029678,it's not wake-ism nor in any way a
99iFAW9fvh8,1029678,1031360,lessening of standards at a time when
99iFAW9fvh8,1031360,1033360,the british army must be prepared to
99iFAW9fvh8,1033360,1036400,engage in warfare at its most violent
99iFAW9fvh8,1036400,1038640,to put it simply you don't need to be
99iFAW9fvh8,1038640,1041600,lavish to be lethal and in a scrap you
99iFAW9fvh8,1041600,1044000,have to truly trust those on your left
99iFAW9fvh8,1044000,1046400,and right
99iFAW9fvh8,1046640,1048000,and when the british army has been faced
99iFAW9fvh8,1048000,1049280,with any challenge during its long
99iFAW9fvh8,1049280,1051280,history it's always been the ingenuity
99iFAW9fvh8,1051280,1053760,of our people that have seen us through
99iFAW9fvh8,1053760,1055679,i know there will be an opportunity cost
99iFAW9fvh8,1055679,1057120,to mobilizing
99iFAW9fvh8,1057120,1058880,and will continually review and balance
99iFAW9fvh8,1058880,1061120,our priorities to meet the emerging
99iFAW9fvh8,1061120,1062160,threats
99iFAW9fvh8,1062160,1064720,but mobilization also requires us to cut
99iFAW9fvh8,1064720,1065600,down
99iFAW9fvh8,1065600,1067600,that which slows us down
99iFAW9fvh8,1067600,1069679,so i want you all i'm talking to the
99iFAW9fvh8,1069679,1070799,army here
99iFAW9fvh8,1070799,1073039,to identify those areas of our process
99iFAW9fvh8,1073039,1075600,and bureaucracy that take up your time
99iFAW9fvh8,1075600,1077919,like any public institution we've
99iFAW9fvh8,1077919,1080480,accumulated some barnacles that slow us
99iFAW9fvh8,1080480,1081440,down
99iFAW9fvh8,1081440,1083760,but we're not just any institution
99iFAW9fvh8,1083760,1087600,so it's time to strip them back
99iFAW9fvh8,1087840,1090080,mobilization is not just an internal
99iFAW9fvh8,1090080,1092799,focus and we must take industry with us
99iFAW9fvh8,1092799,1094160,and have the right relationships with
99iFAW9fvh8,1094160,1096400,our enabling agents to deliver and
99iFAW9fvh8,1096400,1098640,quicken the ambitious modernization
99iFAW9fvh8,1098640,1100640,targets we've set ourselves
99iFAW9fvh8,1100640,1102559,i'll use the next few months to engage
99iFAW9fvh8,1102559,1104160,personally with you our industry
99iFAW9fvh8,1104160,1106160,partners and encourage you to use the
99iFAW9fvh8,1106160,1108320,framework offered by the new land
99iFAW9fvh8,1108320,1110400,industrial strategy to make the army
99iFAW9fvh8,1110400,1111520,more lethal
99iFAW9fvh8,1111520,1113520,and more effective with better equipment
99iFAW9fvh8,1113520,1115280,in the hands of our soldiers at best
99iFAW9fvh8,1115280,1116320,speed
99iFAW9fvh8,1116320,1117840,we cannot be lighting the factory
99iFAW9fvh8,1117840,1120559,furnaces across the nation on the eve of
99iFAW9fvh8,1120559,1123200,war this effort must start now if we
99iFAW9fvh8,1123200,1125679,want to prevent war from happening
99iFAW9fvh8,1125679,1128559,now by nayi i think i'd be naive if i
99iFAW9fvh8,1128559,1130480,ignored the fact that the army's
99iFAW9fvh8,1130480,1132320,platform procurement
99iFAW9fvh8,1132320,1134240,has not been a smooth journey during the
99iFAW9fvh8,1134240,1137360,last decade we have the humility to
99iFAW9fvh8,1137360,1138720,learn the lessons from where it's gone
99iFAW9fvh8,1138720,1140880,wrong and the confidence to engage with
99iFAW9fvh8,1140880,1142160,industry
99iFAW9fvh8,1142160,1144720,to generate the mutual trust required to
99iFAW9fvh8,1144720,1146960,get the very latest technology
99iFAW9fvh8,1146960,1149520,for the best value for money
99iFAW9fvh8,1149520,1150720,and we should also be a little bit
99iFAW9fvh8,1150720,1153200,bolder in celebrating our successes
99iFAW9fvh8,1153200,1156799,ah 64 echo is flying now
99iFAW9fvh8,1156799,1159360,the first boxer will be in service in
99iFAW9fvh8,1159360,1160799,2023
99iFAW9fvh8,1160799,1163200,the first challenger three arrives in
99iFAW9fvh8,1163200,1164640,2024
99iFAW9fvh8,1164640,1167039,and the skysaber air defense system was
99iFAW9fvh8,1167039,1169280,deployed and operating in poland only
99iFAW9fvh8,1169280,1172799,weeks after entering service
99iFAW9fvh8,1173440,1175760,so this speech forms my first order of
99iFAW9fvh8,1175760,1176880,the day
99iFAW9fvh8,1176880,1179280,mobilization is now the main effort
99iFAW9fvh8,1179280,1181200,we're mobilizing the army to help
99iFAW9fvh8,1181200,1183840,prevent war in europe by ready by by
99iFAW9fvh8,1183840,1186320,being ready to fight and win alongside
99iFAW9fvh8,1186320,1188640,our nato allies and partners
99iFAW9fvh8,1188640,1190240,it'll be hard work
99iFAW9fvh8,1190240,1192640,a generational effort and i expect all
99iFAW9fvh8,1192640,1196320,ranks to get ready train hard and engage
99iFAW9fvh8,1196320,1198320,we must be practical and cut through
99iFAW9fvh8,1198320,1200160,unnecessary bureaucracy
99iFAW9fvh8,1200160,1202400,be prepared to de-prioritize where
99iFAW9fvh8,1202400,1204559,activity isn't mission critical
99iFAW9fvh8,1204559,1206559,honestly highlight risks where we
99iFAW9fvh8,1206559,1208000,identify them
99iFAW9fvh8,1208000,1210159,and a full avoid falling victim to the
99iFAW9fvh8,1210159,1211440,seidu gap
99iFAW9fvh8,1211440,1214400,or the lure of institutional panaceas
99iFAW9fvh8,1214400,1215919,conscious of the advice of the late
99iFAW9fvh8,1215919,1218159,great john le carre that whitehall
99iFAW9fvh8,1218159,1220720,panaceas often simply go out with a
99iFAW9fvh8,1220720,1223120,whimper leaving behind the familiar
99iFAW9fvh8,1223120,1225039,english model
99iFAW9fvh8,1225039,1227600,i expect this change to be command led
99iFAW9fvh8,1227600,1229679,and that includes all commanders from
99iFAW9fvh8,1229679,1231360,the general in maine building to the
99iFAW9fvh8,1231360,1233120,unlance corporal in the barrack room
99iFAW9fvh8,1233120,1234960,from the reservist officer on a weekend
99iFAW9fvh8,1234960,1237600,exercise to the civil servant in army
99iFAW9fvh8,1237600,1239120,headquarters
99iFAW9fvh8,1239120,1240720,and as we mobilize
99iFAW9fvh8,1240720,1243200,i echo the words of general montgomery
99iFAW9fvh8,1243200,1245520,to his team in the dust of the north
99iFAW9fvh8,1245520,1248720,african desert in 1942.
99iFAW9fvh8,1248720,1251440,we must have confidence in one another
99iFAW9fvh8,1251440,1253200,as the new cgs
99iFAW9fvh8,1253200,1255280,i have confidence in each and every one
99iFAW9fvh8,1255280,1256400,of you
99iFAW9fvh8,1256400,1259200,and i'm proud to stand among you
99iFAW9fvh8,1259200,1261520,and my final message to you is this
99iFAW9fvh8,1261520,1263520,this is the moment to defend the
99iFAW9fvh8,1263520,1266640,democratic values that define us
99iFAW9fvh8,1266640,1268559,this is the moment to help our brave
99iFAW9fvh8,1268559,1270240,ukrainian allies in their galaxy
99iFAW9fvh8,1270240,1271520,struggle
99iFAW9fvh8,1271520,1273120,this is the moment we stand with our
99iFAW9fvh8,1273120,1275760,friends and partners to maintain peace
99iFAW9fvh8,1275760,1277840,throughout the rest of europe this is
99iFAW9fvh8,1277840,1279440,our moment
99iFAW9fvh8,1279440,1281840,caesar
99iFAW9fvh8,1282880,1285280,chief of the general staff general sir
99iFAW9fvh8,1285280,1287760,patrick sanders speaking there at roof c
99iFAW9fvh8,1287760,1290400,in his uh first formal address in his
99iFAW9fvh8,1290400,1293360,new role tamara is here with us um some
99iFAW9fvh8,1293360,1295039,stark warnings there but he says we're
99iFAW9fvh8,1295039,1296799,ready for the scrap indeed he's just
99iFAW9fvh8,1296799,1299200,taken on the job this month and what a
99iFAW9fvh8,1299200,1301840,powerful warning that the invasion of
99iFAW9fvh8,1301840,1303760,ukraine at the end of february is a
99iFAW9fvh8,1303760,1307919,moment like 1937 pat sir patrick says
99iFAW9fvh8,1307919,1309440,this was this is similar russian
99iFAW9fvh8,1309440,1311360,aggression he says is similar to the
99iFAW9fvh8,1311360,1314000,run-up to nazi germany's invasions of
99iFAW9fvh8,1314000,1315840,other european countries and we need to
99iFAW9fvh8,1315840,1318480,be ready for it he says the british army
99iFAW9fvh8,1318480,1320559,and other western armies need to be in a
99iFAW9fvh8,1320559,1323280,better state not necessarily to provoke
99iFAW9fvh8,1323280,1326080,a war but to prevent one and he says
99iFAW9fvh8,1326080,1328400,that he hopes that our forces won't have
99iFAW9fvh8,1328400,1330480,to fight in northern and eastern europe
99iFAW9fvh8,1330480,1333120,not in ukraine of course but on in nato
99iFAW9fvh8,1333120,1335520,countries and but he says that this is a
99iFAW9fvh8,1335520,1338559,real possibility and at the moment our
99iFAW9fvh8,1338559,1340880,armed forces are not in the right state
99iFAW9fvh8,1340880,1343440,to do so we need to be in a higher state
99iFAW9fvh8,1343440,1345280,of readiness we probably need more
99iFAW9fvh8,1345280,1347280,soldiers he said he expected to be asked
99iFAW9fvh8,1347280,1348960,about that he said it would be perverse
99iFAW9fvh8,1348960,1351120,to cut the number indeed to to have
99iFAW9fvh8,1351120,1354000,further cuts which are expected to we're
99iFAW9fvh8,1354000,1355919,expected to come and i expect he'll also
99iFAW9fvh8,1355919,1358240,be asked about um the defense secretary
99iFAW9fvh8,1358240,1360240,wanting to increase spending on the
99iFAW9fvh8,1360240,1361600,armed forces
99iFAW9fvh8,1361600,1363600,after this spending period which ends in
99iFAW9fvh8,1363600,1366000,2024 because of course he sees the
99iFAW9fvh8,1366000,1368400,russian threat continuing for many years
99iFAW9fvh8,1368400,1370640,to come we know that nato they're
99iFAW9fvh8,1370640,1372240,meeting in madrid
99iFAW9fvh8,1372240,1374159,today they are already calling they're
99iFAW9fvh8,1374159,1375840,already saying they're going to have a
99iFAW9fvh8,1375840,1379600,rapid response force of 300 000 troops
99iFAW9fvh8,1379600,1381600,ready to go in eastern europe he says
99iFAW9fvh8,1381600,1384320,the uk needs to be ready and he said
99iFAW9fvh8,1384320,1386240,that although it is very important that
99iFAW9fvh8,1386240,1388240,we concentrate on new technology and
99iFAW9fvh8,1388240,1390240,digital technology he said pretty
99iFAW9fvh8,1390240,1392559,bluntly you can't cyber your way across
99iFAW9fvh8,1392559,1394480,a river this battle is going to be a
99iFAW9fvh8,1394480,1397360,land battle and therefore the uk army
99iFAW9fvh8,1397360,1399120,needs to focus on that he talked about
99iFAW9fvh8,1399120,1401520,ruthless prioritization to meet the
99iFAW9fvh8,1401520,1403600,current threat this is what he sees as
99iFAW9fvh8,1403600,1406159,the current threat it's like 1937. he
99iFAW9fvh8,1406159,1407520,says it's also a bit like the 18th
99iFAW9fvh8,1407520,1409520,century because vladimir putin he says
99iFAW9fvh8,1409520,1411520,sees himself as a latter day peter the
99iFAW9fvh8,1411520,1413440,great this is the sort of battle we face
99iFAW9fvh8,1413440,1414720,and he says the army needs to be ready
99iFAW9fvh8,1414720,1416960,for it
