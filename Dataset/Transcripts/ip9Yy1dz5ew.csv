ip9Yy1dz5ew,120,2040,- Brandon. What happened to your computer?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,2040,5130,Your whole house has been taken over by babies.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,5130,6840,Is this your workstation?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,6840,7673,- Um.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,7673,9210,- And the dream office I painted
ip9Yy1dz5ew,9210,10740,for you is a nightmare.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,10740,13049,Looks like a prison cell in here.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,13050,14521,It's clear to me that if there's anyone
ip9Yy1dz5ew,14521,16680,in tech crisis right now
ip9Yy1dz5ew,16680,21390,"in need of a $5,000 Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade Makeover,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,21390,24000,"it's our OG camera operator, Brandon."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,24000,25260,But I couldn't help noticing
ip9Yy1dz5ew,25260,27180,that you're kinda trying to double dip here
ip9Yy1dz5ew,27180,30570,because I already built you a computer.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,30570,31403,- [Brandon] That's true.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,31403,32520,- [Linus] It is a little old now.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,32520,34410,"So, what are we doing today?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,34410,37200,- We're building the best photography editing setup
ip9Yy1dz5ew,37200,38070,I could think of.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,38070,39060,There's also a camera show.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,39060,40320,"- [Linus] And your wifi sucks, right?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,40320,41153,- Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,41153,42120,"- Well, I couldn't help noticing"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,42120,44219,part of the problem is that you have it sitting on a box
ip9Yy1dz5ew,44220,45750,at the very corner of your house.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,45750,46583,- Well-
ip9Yy1dz5ew,46583,47416,- [Linus] Okay. We'll talk about that.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,47416,48249,We'll talk about that.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,48249,50100,We're gonna fix that. Thanks Intel.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,50100,51750,We are gonna have some fun today.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,54748,57915,(upbeat techno music)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,63990,66600,The first thing we're gonna do is walk around his house
ip9Yy1dz5ew,66600,68790,and find all the things that are not supposed to be here.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,68790,70590,"Like, say for example, this iFixit kit."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,70590,71789,- It has my name on it.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,71790,73290,- Right? But if at work.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,73290,75090,- There's so many that we've had over the years.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,75090,77009,- Why would you need to have it labeled Brandon
ip9Yy1dz5ew,77010,77880,"if it was at home? - Well, hey,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,77880,79469,I set this up so that we could use it
ip9Yy1dz5ew,79470,80370,with the iFixit kit.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,80370,82980,- Which explains nothing about this one.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,82980,85620,"- Well, yeah, but. - It's brazen."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,85620,86801,It's brazen ladies and gentlemen.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,86801,88620,"He steals not one, but two."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,88620,90180,- Also. This was supposed to be my office.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,90180,91013,That's why it's here.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,91013,92580,- But now this is gonna be the baby's room.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,92580,93413,- Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,93413,95430,- It really is a good thing that you had this room painted
ip9Yy1dz5ew,95430,97320,by such a professional painter.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,97320,99000,"- [David] I don't know, I see some flaws Linus."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,99000,99960,- [Linus] Hold on. (others laughing)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,99960,102420,This is actually not my finest work.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,102420,103253,Back on topic.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,103253,105869,I'm assuming that this is not going to be replaced.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,105870,107520,- Oh no. You don't recognize this?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,107520,108359,- [Linus] Oh my God.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,108360,109740,Is this stolen from the office?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,109740,110573,- [Brandon] Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,110573,111406,- [Linus] Crying out loud.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,111406,112650,- [Brandon] Is a very temporary solution.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,112650,116640,"I had a much worse, just, Telco router"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,116640,118770,"and I needed something that was performing slightly better,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,118770,120659,but then my upgrade was gonna happen soon.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,120660,122730,"So there was no point like, you know,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,122730,124410,setting up the brand new one.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,124410,125370,So I borrowed one.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,125370,127380,"- [Linus] That means your WiFi is decent now already,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,127380,128910,just from having a better router.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,128910,129960,So it can only get better
ip9Yy1dz5ew,129960,131820,once we have a multi access point
ip9Yy1dz5ew,131820,132653,set up. - Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,132653,134040,- Cool. That's gonna be awesome.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,134040,135599,This I'm pretty sure you bought.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,135600,136433,- Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,136433,137610,- The good old razor blades- - Classic.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,137610,138480,- Does your still work?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,138480,141989,- So I replaced the battery in this
ip9Yy1dz5ew,141990,143580,from an eBay battery.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,143580,144540,It didn't work.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,144540,145372,- [Linus] Really?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,145373,146340,- [Brandon] So it turns plugged in.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,146340,147690,But as soon-
ip9Yy1dz5ew,147690,149160,"- I was, I was testing. - Yes."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,149160,151020,- [Linus] These were our Christmas bonus-
ip9Yy1dz5ew,151020,153000,- [Brandon] I used it for a long time.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,153000,154140,"- [Linus] Six, seven years ago?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,154140,155130,- [Brandon] Yeah.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,155130,157020,- Prototype LTT mousepad.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,157020,158670,What is it with the OG employees
ip9Yy1dz5ew,158670,160680,thinking they're entitled to our prototypes?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,160680,161519,- [Brandon] Well- - Ed had
ip9Yy1dz5ew,161520,162353,more than one of these.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,162353,163470,- [Ed] It was in the swag pile!
ip9Yy1dz5ew,163470,165060,- [Linus] I can see why you needed camera stuff.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,165060,165892,"- [Brandon] Yeah, no kidding."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,165893,167400,"- This is like, oh my God!"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,167400,168930,Brandon's a photography nerd.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,168930,171870,And there's no reason for him to own
ip9Yy1dz5ew,171870,173340,"a photography nerd thing,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,173340,175470,unless it has some kind of specific purpose.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,175470,177604,"This, made in China,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,177604,179130,"35 millimeter,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,179130,180088,"focus free,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,180088,181650,point and shoot.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,181650,182670,Why do you have it?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,182670,184349,- I found this in my mom's house.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,184350,186900,She had no idea why she had this.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,186900,188760,And I think it was like a toy camera
ip9Yy1dz5ew,188760,190290,that someone gave to her.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,190290,191122,For me.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,191123,192090,You could actually look at this
ip9Yy1dz5ew,192090,193530,"and it's technically my first camera,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,193530,195630,even though I don't remember using it as a child.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,195630,196530,"You remember at the beginning,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,196530,198209,"when we were using my lenses for work,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,198210,199440,I bought this at that time.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,199440,201180,- I couldn't afford lenses. Okay?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,201180,204000,"I'm 99% sure that this isn't stolen from work,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,204000,206340,"but, like, the guy needs a camera shelf."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,206340,207690,- That's my first camera.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,207690,209010,"- But, this, you just told me"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,209010,210355,a different camera was your first camera!
ip9Yy1dz5ew,210356,212273,"- Well, okay. That was child's first camera."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,212273,213983,- So now you're a thief and a liar.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,214950,215782,"Now, I don't think-"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,215783,217680,"What are you, what is that face?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,217680,218790,- I'm just waiting for your judgment.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,218790,223230,"- No, I built this computer! - Technically, sort of."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,223230,224069,- Very nice.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,224070,225420,- It has changed since you built it.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,225420,227520,"- Yeah. I mean, obviously I didn't do this."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,227520,229260,"- Since you built me this PC,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,229260,231750,the cooler motherboard and GPU have changed.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,231750,232710,And the CPU.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,232710,234477,So most of it's changed. Except for the power supply.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,234477,237840,The CPU started to get pretty sluggish recently.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,237840,239970,"So I kind of just stopped using this desktop,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,239970,242130,"honestly, altogether because I got an XPS"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,242130,244320,and then that was working better.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,244320,245760,Oh. - Oh.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,245760,246592,- [Brandon] Percy.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,246593,247740,- [Linus] Would you like to go out?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,247740,249210,Hi. - He really wants
ip9Yy1dz5ew,249210,250050,to go inside.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,250050,251913,"Okay, buddy. Let's cut you upstairs."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,254070,256440,- No doubt. This new machine's gonna be a lot better.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,256440,258570,"Now, I know you've fancied the H1"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,258570,259680,for quite some time. - Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,259680,261449,"- In fact, didn't you buy our-"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,261450,263760,"- So actually, over here-"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,263760,264780,"- [Linus] What is that, another one?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,264780,267120,- [Brandon] This was the one I originally bought.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,267120,268680,- [Linus] Yeah. - And then NZXT heard
ip9Yy1dz5ew,268680,270180,that I was gonna use my upgrade
ip9Yy1dz5ew,270180,272100,"with the original version of the H1,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,272100,273540,which I'm sure many people know.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,273540,274860,- It has a bit of a problem
ip9Yy1dz5ew,274860,276060,- [Brandon] Set itself on fire.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,276060,276893,- [Linus] Safety issues.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,276893,278490,"- Technically, to NZXT's credit,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,278490,280560,they sent me the new screws and they sent me
ip9Yy1dz5ew,280560,281669,the new GPU riser.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,281670,282503,- Okay.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,282503,283740,- So I have that. It's actually over there.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,283740,285389,"Also, I will admit there's one more thing"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,285390,287010,from the office still here that I-
ip9Yy1dz5ew,287010,288741,- You still have one of those?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,288741,289574,- Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,289574,291090,"- You're not the only one,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,291090,295110,"but these LG 31 inch 4k monitors,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,295110,297276,some of them disappeared because
ip9Yy1dz5ew,297277,299730,"""Well, Linus, well, you know, just temporarily"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,299730,301050,I might need to use them at home
ip9Yy1dz5ew,301050,302490,"to do, like, work sometimes."""
ip9Yy1dz5ew,302490,304349,And then none of them made their way back.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,304350,305798,"Give me that. Give, give me that."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,305798,306631,"- Okay, There you go."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,306631,307800,- You're returning it to logistics.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,307800,310020,"I'm gonna start unpacking computer hardware stuff,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,310020,311220,"then, in the meantime."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,311220,313080,- Maybe you build the computer while I build the shelf?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,313080,314039,'Cause that might take a bit.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,314040,316200,And then also unbox some of the other stuff.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,316200,317760,- Oh my God.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,317760,320850,I see a lot more than just one Ikea box here.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,320850,324180,"So yeah, we need to call in an emergency"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,324180,325432,logistics strike here.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,325433,327600,Let's ask someone to come help us.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,327600,328770,And we have a surprise guest!
ip9Yy1dz5ew,328770,331860,"- This is my partner, Sophia. - Hi."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,331860,332693,- Here we go.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,332693,334050,- There. So that's- - There we go.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,334050,334949,- Did I scratch it? Oh no.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,334950,336108,That's not supposed to be there.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,336108,337140,(Brandon laughing)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,337140,339090,I saw this line. I was like-
ip9Yy1dz5ew,339090,340169,"- [David] If that was you scratching it,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,340170,341965,that's straighter than your paint lines.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,341965,345240,- (laughing) Oh! David throwing shade!
ip9Yy1dz5ew,345240,347871,"- Oh, are we gonna meet another surprise guest?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,347871,348923,"(Baby starts crying) - [Brandon] Aww, no."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,351720,354690,- Brandon's baby gives me so much joy
ip9Yy1dz5ew,354690,357780,because he's the first one of the other dads
ip9Yy1dz5ew,357780,360439,at LMG that has had a baby as challenging
ip9Yy1dz5ew,360439,363300,or more challenging than my firstborn.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,363300,364349,- He's happy about this
ip9Yy1dz5ew,364350,365697,because he wants me to suffer the way he did.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,365697,367169,"- [Linus] Did the good news is that,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,367170,368760,"like, my son's amazing. - [David] Yeah."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,368760,370830,"- And so he'll probably be amazing, you know,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,370830,372090,I'm sure there's a correlation.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,372090,374040,"- [David] I mean, I was apparently a really easy baby"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,374040,375393,"and I turned out awful, so."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,376770,378539,"- Awkward question for you, Brandon."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,378540,380010,I couldn't help noticing that this
ip9Yy1dz5ew,380010,383250,is a many generations old motherboard.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,383250,385410,- I bought this from the office
ip9Yy1dz5ew,385410,387120,with the CPU that's in this box.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,387120,388080,It's still Intel. So.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,388080,391680,"- That's true. The 9,700K is a great chip."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,391680,393449,- It just felt wasteful. I didn't need to buy more.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,393450,395190,"So I figured, use what I have."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,395190,396023,- Fair enough.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,396023,399060,- I've been cursed with front IO
ip9Yy1dz5ew,399060,402480,on every desktop PC I've ever used.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,402480,403313,- That's true.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,403313,405659,- My office PC front IO doesn't work.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,405660,407880,"This computer that Linus built for me,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,407880,410400,the front IO never worked.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,410400,411660,- So far the common denominator
ip9Yy1dz5ew,411660,413340,"is that I built both of those machines,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,413340,414540,but it's not me. (Brandon laughs)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,414540,415373,It's not me.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,415373,417060,The front IO works on lots of other computers I built.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,417060,419280,- Headers are plugged in. It just didn't work.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,419280,421380,So I'm gonna be interested to see if the front IO
ip9Yy1dz5ew,421380,423150,on this guy works. - It'll work.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,423150,424949,I give you my Linus Tech Tips guarantee
ip9Yy1dz5ew,424950,426900,that your front IO will work. - Okay.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,426900,430979,- I sincerely hope that this GPU fits.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,430980,432360,- What?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,432360,435449,- This is a really beefy 3060 Ti.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,435450,437550,- [Brandon] I was told that it would fit.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,437550,440634,"- With all the cooling. Thank you, EVGA."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,440634,442110,"Oh, that looks solid."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,442110,443517,Yeah. We're good to go.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,443517,445011,- Do you have the instructions?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,445011,447270,- I couldn't find them in the box.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,447270,448590,Ikea instructions suck.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,448590,450030,"- Well, the instructions suck,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,450030,451380,but I'd still say you're better off
ip9Yy1dz5ew,451380,453600,with them than without them. (Brandon laughs)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,453600,454620,"- [Sophia] Wait, what's this?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,454620,457979,"- Oh! Okay, so she's more competent than me."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,457980,460437,This is why she's taking care of a baby every day
ip9Yy1dz5ew,460437,463170,and I'm just pointing cameras at things.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,463170,465600,"- [Linus] Yeah, exactly. - [David] Hey!"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,465600,466433,- I'm kidding.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,466433,467266,"I'm kidding, David. (Others laugh)"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,467266,468389,We work really hard. I'm joking.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,468390,470460,"- Yeah, but one thing that Brandon actually assembled"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,470460,471293,before we got here.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,471293,472470,"- Hey, the lamp too!"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,472470,474690,"- You assembled a lamp. Oh, okay."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,474690,475890,- But it's a sick-
ip9Yy1dz5ew,475890,478920,Okay. How do you assemble this lamp Linus?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,478920,479753,- That is a pretty cool lamp.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,479753,481860,"But you didn't clean it, Brandon."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,481860,482693,Oh my gosh.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,482693,483539,- I actually probably need to.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,483540,485160,- It's so dirty on the inside.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,485160,487170,- Yeah. I need to take it off and take it apart.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,487170,490500,"- So Brandon be all like, ""Yeah. I built that too."""
ip9Yy1dz5ew,490500,491333,Mm.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,491333,493260,"By the way, we're gonna have to take it apart and rebuild."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,493260,495060,So actually you did negative.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,495060,496470,- It's a later problem.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,496470,499590,- Steelcase chair. I've never actually tried a Steelcase.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,499590,500699,I've tried Herman Miller.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,500700,502110,I've tried like all the different gaming brands
ip9Yy1dz5ew,502110,502943,and everything.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,502943,504750,I actually like the way they do the lumbar support.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,504750,507900,"It's like hard, but padded."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,507900,509790,Okay. That's a good quality foam.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,509790,511050,"- [Brandon] You know, what's funny about this?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,511050,512820,I will have still not built my own computer.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,512820,514504,- Why am I letting you get away with this?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,514504,515336,(Brandon laughs)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,515336,517289,"I've already got my PCIE riser hooked up,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,517289,519060,They've got this really nice little plastic piece
ip9Yy1dz5ew,519060,522060,that keeps you from folding it too much or too little.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,522060,523620,- [Sophia] This is a terrible screwdriver.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,523620,524910,- Totally unprompted.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,524910,527310,"Okay, she has no horses in this race,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,527310,529320,but you're complaining that's a terrible screwdriver?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,529320,531780,"Okay, I'll give you ours. I'll see what you think."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,531780,535590,I want your completely unbiased thoughts on it.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,535590,536423,"- Well, yeah, it's better"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,536423,538560,because it doesn't shake the whole time.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,538560,541110,"- [Linus] It's not available yet, but it's coming very soon."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,541110,543600,"One disadvantage to an older platform,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,543600,545459,"even though the performance might be fine,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,545460,546960,is that you might not have support
ip9Yy1dz5ew,546960,548160,for the latest standards though.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,548160,550440,"Brandon, at best, your front IO"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,550440,553080,is going to be about 75% functional
ip9Yy1dz5ew,553080,557520,because you don't have a USB-C front panel header on here.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,557520,559962,"Wait, does this even support M.2?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,559962,562829,- Please tell me it does. Is it on the back of the board?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,562830,563663,- Oh it is! It is! It's on the back.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,563663,566280,"- [Brandon] I thought it did. I, like, looked at this."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,566280,567113,"- Okay, yes."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,567113,569730,"- Oh my god. Linus, you were gonna give me a heart attack."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,569730,571440,- Let's put your SSD in. Wow.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,571440,573000,You went with a rocket four plus. Okay.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,573000,573870,I can tell you right now.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,573870,575790,You're not getting the most outta this SSD.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,575790,577019,Because this is gen four.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,577020,578520,And this is a gen three board.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,579600,581069,- Yeah. Ikea furniture.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,581070,583230,"Wait, why does it feel like it's not fitting?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,583230,585029,"- Wait, is someone making that noise"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,585030,586470,or is that the Ikea furniture?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,586470,588240,"- [Sophia] That's the baby. - [Linus] Oh, that's the baby."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,588240,590730,Can I just say how much I love my job today?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,590730,591563,"- I think this is upside down,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,591563,592800,'cause there's a hole up there.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,592800,593760,"- Cavalry is here,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,593760,597690,"Sergiy from logistics apparently was out, but not off."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,597690,599190,HTMI.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,599190,600063,Power.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,601110,602883,Did I ever wire up the front?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,604470,605730,- [Brandon] That's not a great sign.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,605730,607793,- This CPU and this motherboard are not compatible.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,607793,608626,(Others laughing)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,608626,609930,- [David] What? Oh no.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,609930,612360,"- Dude, your board's only good up to seventh gen."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,612360,615269,That's why it's not turning on. So.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,615270,617310,So are there any ITX boards?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,617310,618450,- [Logistic] We don't have very many.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,618450,620403,"- [Linus] Oh, what's this? 10th gen."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,621600,623639,How much budget do you have left over Brandon?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,623640,626640,- [Brandon] None. I'm actually a little bit over budget.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,626640,629610,- Okay. Gimme some time.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,629610,632490,- Okay. I watched Andy's upgrade back in the day
ip9Yy1dz5ew,632490,635757,and I saw his BenQ light bar thing
ip9Yy1dz5ew,635757,637260,and I just had to have one.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,637260,639540,And apparently this is the newer version
ip9Yy1dz5ew,639540,641880,"that has a better controller, said Andy."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,641880,644250,So I'm excited to actually inbox it and see how this goes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,644250,645083,"- [Linus] Well, I'm glad you put"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,645083,646290,so much thought into your lamp.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,646290,649230,Meanwhile I'm sitting here shopping for motherboards.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,649230,651899,"- Linus, lighting is a very important part of my life."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,651900,653640,- So is a functioning computer.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,653640,655410,"- Because this is the lowest floor of my house,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,655410,657899,my garage door is actually behind David right now
ip9Yy1dz5ew,657900,660540,and the door to the outside being blocked by this shelf
ip9Yy1dz5ew,660540,662040,is where we go on walks.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,662040,664860,"So I always come in here and tractor in,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,664860,667079,"and yes, you can get rugs that help with that."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,667080,669900,But it's never perfect. So vacuum.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,669900,671100,We just had these at the office.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,671100,672930,I think they're from the channel Super Fun
ip9Yy1dz5ew,672930,674399,where they sucked up sand.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,674400,675690,So there's a very high chance
ip9Yy1dz5ew,675690,676890,there's already sand in this.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,676890,678270,- Oh nice. Perfect. (Brandon laughing)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,678270,681394,"There's nothing used, nothing new,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,681394,684300,"nothing borrowed, nothing blue."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,684300,685230,Just nothing.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,685230,686063,- I'm sorry.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,686063,688440,- CPUs are so reliable
ip9Yy1dz5ew,688440,691320,that once it's a couple of years
ip9Yy1dz5ew,691320,692580,"out of current,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,692580,694680,"there ends up being this, like,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,694680,697080,glut of CPU availability
ip9Yy1dz5ew,697080,698850,and almost no motherboards for them
ip9Yy1dz5ew,698850,702029,because the motherboards are dying and the CPUs are not.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,702030,703890,"Yeah, and because it's ITX,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,703890,705780,"I mean the sales volume of ITX,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,705780,708240,I could find you anything you need if it's ATX.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,708240,711330,"If we're going 12 gen, we actually have"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,711330,712403,modern boards at the office.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,712403,714030,This is hilarious.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,714030,717120,"He's like, ""No man, I'm gonna use old Intel."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,717120,717953,"It's like, good enough."""
ip9Yy1dz5ew,717953,718786,And we're going 12 gen after.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,718786,721980,"Hey, but, your front IO. The curse is lifted."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,721980,722813,- That's true.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,722813,725790,"Well, yet to be lifted. The computer isn't on yet."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,725790,727680,"- You know what, why don't we send Sergiy"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,727680,730500,to get the 12 400 and find a motherboard?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,730500,732300,- Okay. - I'll get the wifi fixed.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,732300,733380,- Oh sure.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,733380,735900,- This monitor is gonna be such a game changer for you.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,735900,738780,- I am so excited about this monitor.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,738780,740250,It is everything I've ever wanted
ip9Yy1dz5ew,740250,741180,in a monitor and more.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,741180,744810,"- So when it comes to just editing photos,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,744810,746100,"you're not after, necessarily,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,746100,748560,the brightest freaking display.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,748560,750210,So what you want is calibration.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,750210,752550,"What you want is size, obviously."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,752550,756120,"Now, thing is, I think I actually was the one"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,756120,757843,who sought the short circuit for this.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,757843,758676,- [Brandon] You were?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,758676,760110,- [Linus] I don't remember anything about it
ip9Yy1dz5ew,760950,764340,"because we're in a quite vertically tall,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,764340,766680,but small townhouse.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,766680,768540,It doesn't really affect us that much
ip9Yy1dz5ew,768540,770910,because they're not gonna be so far from each other
ip9Yy1dz5ew,770910,772410,that it's gonna be a real problem for them
ip9Yy1dz5ew,772410,773459,to talk to each other.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,773460,774880,The main thing we need to consider
ip9Yy1dz5ew,774880,778200,is how we stagger them from floor to floor.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,778200,779880,We've got three stories to work with.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,779880,781200,So we wanna go like this.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,781200,783090,"Then like this, then like this,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,783090,786510,in order to optimize the coverage of each one.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,786510,788010,That means our next order of business
ip9Yy1dz5ew,788010,789510,is doing some scouting.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,789510,790830,"I know there's ethernet here,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,790830,793980,because this is where Brandon used to have his desktop.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,793980,795720,And there it is.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,795720,797579,We're gonna use that for one of our Decos.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,797580,799890,- I'm installing this fully monitor arm.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,799890,801780,"If you can tell right here, David,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,801780,804528,there's a slant of the wood on my desk.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,804528,806850,"So it's not flat when it bites,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,806850,808319,which I think might be a problem
ip9Yy1dz5ew,808320,811770,because that monitor is not super light.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,811770,813630,- This can just go like this.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,813630,815880,Cable managed. Gorgeous.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,815880,819630,The way that this is attached is just like a screw here.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,819630,823410,"So if we loosen this screw, we might get more play."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,823410,825180,"Heck yeah, come have a look at this."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,825180,827610,It actually worked amazing.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,827610,828750,Better than I could have expected.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,828750,831143,"- [Brandon] Oh my God. That's like, that's clean on there."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,831143,832050,- [Linus] Yeah.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,832050,835529,"We could put the Deco here, in this room,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,835530,837360,but it would basically be right under the one
ip9Yy1dz5ew,837360,838709,that I put in the kitchen.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,838710,840540,"The other place for it would be in the garage,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,840540,842610,but there's really nothing WiFi in the garage.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,842610,844980,"So, oh wait, you do OTA updates on your car."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,844980,845813,- [Brandon] I do.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,845813,847620,"- Well, it would be good if those are fast."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,847620,848453,- [Brandon] Yeah.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,848453,849774,- Okay. I'm gonna put this in the garage then.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,849774,851580,"I'm just gonna put it on that shoe rack, okay?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,851580,852413,- [Brandon] Sure. - [Linus] Okay.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,852413,854820,- Just got the base mount on. Hopefully I do this right.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,854820,855880,"Wait, does it slide in this way?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,855880,858570,"There we go. Oh, okay."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,858570,862770,So I clearly have some tension adjustment to do.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,862770,865593,- You had slash have an eight bay Nas already.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,865593,866910,- [Brandon] It's right here.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,866910,867810,"- [Linus] Oh, there it is."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,867810,870870,- Here is my eight bay that I've had forever.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,870870,874140,It is filled with four terabyte drives.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,874140,876360,- Right. That's not a lot of capacity these days.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,876360,877560,- No. It is not.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,877560,881640,And I didn't really want to have to go through
ip9Yy1dz5ew,881640,883860,all the trouble of moving all the data
ip9Yy1dz5ew,883860,885071,from that NAS
ip9Yy1dz5ew,885072,888000,to maybe the server at work temporarily
ip9Yy1dz5ew,888000,890790,and then put it all back onto something else.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,890790,892620,- So you're gonna be a two NAS household now.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,892620,895620,- Yes. This is not a perfect solution
ip9Yy1dz5ew,895620,897120,"to my problem because, eventually,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,897120,899759,this will also run out. But-
ip9Yy1dz5ew,899759,901259,- So you're just kicking this can down the road.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,901260,904380,- Yes. Future Brandon will find another solution to this.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,904380,905790,"- Long time future Brandon,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,905790,907949,"'cause each one of these individual drives,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,907950,909440,and you went with EXOS enterprise.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,909440,910830,- Yes. - Nice.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,910830,913620,Each of these drives holds as much as half of that NAS.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,913620,916440,"So you've doubled, tripled. This will be used for parity."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,916440,917550,You've tripled your storage.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,917550,918930,- Yes. - In only five bays
ip9Yy1dz5ew,918930,919763,instead of eight.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,919763,920596,- Yes. - Nice.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,920596,922470,This should be just absolutely killer.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,922470,925050,Perfect WiFi all over the house now.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,925050,926700,"These tend to be a little bit sticky,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,926700,929040,in terms of which access point they're connected to.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,929040,930329,I doubt I'm connected to this one.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,930330,932070,"I'm probably connected to the one on the other floor,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,932070,935351,"but, I mean, even connected to the mid floor one,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,935351,936930,it's very usable.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,936930,938880,I just don't see WiFi being a problem
ip9Yy1dz5ew,938880,940620,anywhere in this house from now on.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,940620,942300,Okay. Let's go fix that computer.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,942300,943830,The good news is you're getting the most
ip9Yy1dz5ew,943830,945960,out of your gen four SSD now.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,945960,947880,Here comes our 12 400.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,947880,949980,This is six performance cores
ip9Yy1dz5ew,949980,953430,and then four efficiency cores for a total of 10.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,953430,955290,I mean the more important thing is that
ip9Yy1dz5ew,955290,958388,"Alder Lake compared to, what did you have, a ninth gen?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,958388,959895,Yeah. Ninth gen. - Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,959895,962880,Way better single threaded performance.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,962880,964740,"Which, for applications like Photoshop,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,964740,966570,can actually be more important
ip9Yy1dz5ew,966570,968370,than your multi-threaded performance
ip9Yy1dz5ew,968370,969810,depending on what you're doing.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,969810,971413,"We've got, oh, what even is this?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,971413,974550,"5,200 mega transfer per second? Two by 16."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,974550,975450,- Here's one thing I expect.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,975450,979080,"Well here's the Kingston Workflow Station SD card reader,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,979080,981510,"micro SD card reader, CFast card reader."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,981510,983010,"- Oh, is this kind of a spiritual successor"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,983010,984540,to that Lexar thing we used to really like?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,984540,986009,"- Yeah, well we have this at the office now."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,986010,986850,"- Oh, okay, cool."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,986850,988470,"- And I was like, well I have to have one for myself."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,988470,991110,You have these little modules that have different IO.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,991110,993959,Like this is a type C one and a type A
ip9Yy1dz5ew,993960,996813,and then these ones are SD.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,996813,998957,More SD. I probably only asked for SD.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,998957,1001639,- The king of SD. - I only really use SD.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1001640,1003410,He's a standard definition kind of guy.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1003410,1004370,And the cool thing about them
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1004370,1006800,"is that you can use them in here, right?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1006800,1008930,Where it just uses a single USB-C connection
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1008930,1009830,to your computer.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1009830,1012920,"Or, because it's all USB-C all the time,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1012920,1014720,you can just plug a USB-C cable into this
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1014720,1017990,"and it's just a super lightweight, small, card reader."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1017990,1019070,And you can take it with you on the go.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1019070,1020150,- Thanks Kingston.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1020150,1023210,- I'd say that the fit and finish of the molds.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1023210,1025280,- We actually have tape around the ones that are at work.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1025280,1028400,"- Not amazing, but minor critique."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1028400,1030662,"Guys, please tell me I have thermal compound."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1030662,1032449,- What? - I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1032449,1034159,"When I went back for the motherboards, I got some."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1034160,1035510,- [Brandon] Don't do this to me.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1035510,1036343,Why? (Linus laughs)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1036343,1038089,You have to leave soon. We're not even close to done.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1038089,1038923,"- Yeah, I know."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1038923,1039890,But I'm not the one who's getting upset.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1039890,1041720,How are you planning to connect this computer
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1041720,1043400,and those NAS's to the network?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1043400,1046400,- I had a switch upstairs so I could bring it down.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1046400,1049250,"In a perfect world, I'm gonna get like BESTA storage"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1049250,1050690,or something for above my desk.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1050690,1052129,And I'll drill a hole through it.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1052130,1054290,Run the NAS on the top so that this cable
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1054290,1056660,just goes straight up instead of going down.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1056660,1058310,- And then Brandon's gonna celebrate
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1058310,1059930,his kid's sixth birthday
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1059930,1062720,because that's how long it's gonna take to get to that.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1062720,1065330,"I'm getting real close on this PC by the way, boys."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1065330,1066163,- [Brandon] Okay.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1066163,1067309,"Well, my speakers are about to get plugged in."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1067310,1069560,"- Nice. Okay, we're close then."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1069560,1071840,Is this non LTT desk pad part of your upgrade?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1071840,1072980,- Yes. - Surely you knew
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1072980,1074450,you were gonna take some flack for that.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1074450,1077870,"- As much as I like the LTT store design,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1077870,1079490,it doesn't quite match my setup.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1079490,1081350,- That's fair. We do need some more colors.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1081350,1083929,"It's kind of amazing, for how far away we were"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1083930,1086342,"20 minutes ago- - Hey, not bad."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1086342,1090042,- How not far away we are now.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1090042,1091940,Oh buddy! There it is.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1091940,1093620,"- [Brandon] Hey, did it just post?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1093620,1095210,- [Linus] It did! - [Brandon] Nice.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1095210,1098899,"- 32 gigs RAM, core i5, 12 400 K, everything's detected."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1098900,1100520,There's our M.2 drive.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1100520,1101540,"- Hey, that looks pretty good."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1101540,1103100,"- Hey, that looks awesome."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1103100,1105380,- One of the last decisions I haven't talked about yet
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1105380,1109910,is these 95 CRI 40 watt LED bulbs
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1109910,1111170,that I'm going to put
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1111170,1113270,all in the light pictures in the room.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1113270,1115490,And that is also what is in this lamp.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1115490,1117050,- [Linus] And why do you need those?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1117050,1118190,- Color accuracy?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1118190,1119149,"- No, I know."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1119150,1122150,"You're explaining to the audience, God. (laughs)"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1122150,1127070,"- These are pretty bright, pretty efficient, and dimmable."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1127070,1128840,And it'll make the pleasantness
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1128840,1131960,of the color of this room a lot better day-to-day.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1131960,1134179,"- Brandon, do you have a USB type C something"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1134180,1136310,that I can plug in and make sure your front IO works?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1136310,1137513,Does the keyboard work?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1138830,1139663,- [Brandon] Sure does.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1139663,1141440,"- [Linus] Okay. Alright, how about now?"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1141440,1143779,"Wait, we're not done yet."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1143780,1145850,Does the keyboard work?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1145850,1146870,- Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1146870,1148730,- Okay. Third time's a charm.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1148730,1149992,Does the keyboard work?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1151940,1153200,- The curse is over.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1153200,1156440,- [David] What's the dance of the front port working?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1156440,1157664,- Oh my goodness.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1157664,1159379,- [David] Okay. Don't break anything.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1159380,1161360,- You've gone full dad now. - Yeah.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1161360,1162193,- That's hilarious.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1162193,1164000,I don't think the Brandon Lee I first met
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1164000,1166730,would've done a curses-over dance.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1166730,1167690,"It's just, it's something about"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1167690,1169309,just not sleeping for a year.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1169310,1171050,- Yeah. You stop caring. (Linus laughs)
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1171050,1171883,- This is not bad.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1171883,1173300,"- I don't know, dude."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1173300,1176990,I cannot say that I'm sold on this particular.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1176990,1179120,- Does this turn? It turns.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1179120,1181640,- But why would you ever want to shine
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1181640,1183050,light at your monitor?
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1183050,1185240,"- It's not going at the monitor, it's going down."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1185240,1186466,It's going straight down.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1186466,1188120,- You know what? The setup looks beautiful.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1188120,1190003,- [Brandon] Let me just turn off the light.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1191000,1191833,There you go.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1191833,1194240,"Now you're like, you know, you're taking some notes,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1194240,1197000,I can see without having to have a lamp
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1197000,1198560,"that only shines in one direction,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1198560,1199760,not in where I'm looking.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1199760,1201380,And then I have my other lamp there
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1201380,1202310,"with the higher CRI bulb,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1202310,1205250,that's also just adding a little bit of ambience.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1205250,1207170,- So you're in the zone now. - Yes.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1207170,1208670,"- [Linus] Well, there's no doubt in my mind."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1208670,1210590,This is about as ultimate as it gets
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1210590,1212870,for a photography-editing workstation.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1212870,1214790,We've got powerful single threaded performance
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1214790,1216350,"with an Intel 12 400,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1216350,1219463,"another 64 terabytes of storage added,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1219463,1221570,"color accurate lighting for the room,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1221570,1223549,"not to mention a color accurate monitor,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1223550,1225680,all the ingest capabilities
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1225680,1227780,that any one man could possibly desire
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1227780,1230519,on top of camera storage
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1230519,1233420,that takes all the random stuff that we found
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1233420,1234290,all throughout the house
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1234290,1238130,and gets it out of Brandon's poor SO's way.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1238130,1239810,Not to mention prevents all of it
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1239810,1242030,from being chewed on by the baby.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1242030,1244250,The only thing it still needs at this point
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1244250,1247010,is a little bit more TLC in terms of cable management.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1247010,1249170,But we'll get that sorted out by the time you guys are
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1249170,1253040,looking at this gorgeous glamtage of the finished setup.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1253040,1255500,I hope you guys enjoyed Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1255500,1258140,Brandon Lee edition. Massive thanks to Intel.
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1258140,1260300,"And if you guys are looking for something else to watch,"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1260300,1262790,"then maybe go check out, man, what would be-"
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1262790,1265280,"if you enjoyed this one, you might enjoy Riley's as well."
ip9Yy1dz5ew,1265280,1267443,The minimalistic setup.
