hjzLs_6mqA8,196959,198000,we're gonna do three rounds you can
hjzLs_6mqA8,198000,199920,prepare two meats one meat that's a bit
hjzLs_6mqA8,199920,201519,cheap affordable and one that's a lot
hjzLs_6mqA8,201519,203680,more expensive i need to guess which one
hjzLs_6mqA8,203680,205280,is more expensive not only what's more
hjzLs_6mqA8,205280,207280,expensive but i also want you to tell me
hjzLs_6mqA8,207280,208879,which one obviously tastes better
hjzLs_6mqA8,208879,210400,because sometimes just because it's more
hjzLs_6mqA8,210400,212159,expensive doesn't mean that it's better
hjzLs_6mqA8,212159,213599,i'm excited to find out what you think
hjzLs_6mqA8,213599,215280,and most importantly i have a twist
hjzLs_6mqA8,215280,216959,today that we're gonna be doing for my
hjzLs_6mqA8,216959,218640,channel you've tried a lot of nasty
hjzLs_6mqA8,218640,220720,things but i can guarantee you you've
hjzLs_6mqA8,220720,222159,never tried that that's coming soon and
hjzLs_6mqA8,222159,223519,that's gonna be on his channel i think
hjzLs_6mqA8,223519,225440,the next step is just to get started
hjzLs_6mqA8,225440,226720,let's go
hjzLs_6mqA8,226720,228000,awkward handshake oh wait that's a
hjzLs_6mqA8,228000,229920,pretty good handshake standard handshake
hjzLs_6mqA8,229920,231200,that's right you got to shake your hand

hjzLs_6mqA8,238959,241599,this is a skirt steak and here we have a
hjzLs_6mqA8,241599,244000,flat iron now the price is not expensive
hjzLs_6mqA8,244000,246159,we got to start him a little slow 22
hjzLs_6mqA8,246159,248640,dollars for this steak this one is 40
hjzLs_6mqA8,248640,250480,now they taste extremely different i'm
hjzLs_6mqA8,250480,251660,wondering what he's gonna say
hjzLs_6mqA8,251660,253360,[Music]
hjzLs_6mqA8,253360,255519,so we're gonna put a nice beautiful sear

hjzLs_6mqA8,257280,259519,fire put this one up too cook both at
hjzLs_6mqA8,259519,262840,the same time

hjzLs_6mqA8,290479,292960,second one top sirloin no not even close

hjzLs_6mqA8,298880,301199,cuts it comes from the chuck okay let's
hjzLs_6mqA8,301199,302560,not touch that part i thought he's gonna
hjzLs_6mqA8,302560,303680,touch me in the chuck which one you're
hjzLs_6mqA8,303680,305360,gonna go first this one all right let's
hjzLs_6mqA8,305360,305820,go
hjzLs_6mqA8,305820,307759,[Music]
hjzLs_6mqA8,307759,310280,cheers
hjzLs_6mqA8,310280,313199,[Music]
hjzLs_6mqA8,313199,316000,shut the front door
hjzLs_6mqA8,316160,317680,unbelievably rich and probably rich
hjzLs_6mqA8,317680,319280,already by itself but you just smother
hjzLs_6mqA8,319280,320960,with butter butter makes everything
hjzLs_6mqA8,320960,323039,better juicy soft that's one of the
hjzLs_6mqA8,323039,324320,things about this cut a lot of people
hjzLs_6mqA8,324320,326240,don't realize how tender it actually is
hjzLs_6mqA8,326240,328240,it is my wife's favorite cut by the way
hjzLs_6mqA8,328240,329520,absolutely one of my favorites we need
hjzLs_6mqA8,329520,331360,to try this to compare
hjzLs_6mqA8,331360,332720,i'm gonna grab a middle piece yeah i
hjzLs_6mqA8,332720,336240,gotta scrap it from a pile of tortillas
hjzLs_6mqA8,336560,338720,also juicy but less interspersed fat
hjzLs_6mqA8,338720,340400,definitely not the same pizzazz or like
hjzLs_6mqA8,340400,342240,fireworks in my mouth as a skirt steak
hjzLs_6mqA8,342240,343280,i'm thinking that you're liking the
hjzLs_6mqA8,343280,344880,squid steak a lot better oh if it comes
hjzLs_6mqA8,344880,346240,to what do i like more for sure the
hjzLs_6mqA8,346240,347759,skirt's taking now i'm trying to figure
hjzLs_6mqA8,347759,349199,out which is more expensive this skirt
hjzLs_6mqA8,349199,350800,steak used to be what people threw away
hjzLs_6mqA8,350800,352639,the price has been going up because
hjzLs_6mqA8,352639,354080,people are competing for it now whether
hjzLs_6mqA8,354080,356000,it's for fajitas or japanese food so it
hjzLs_6mqA8,356000,357440,seems like it should be cheap but i
hjzLs_6mqA8,357440,359120,think that secretly this is a more
hjzLs_6mqA8,359120,361199,expensive cut oh no you got it wrong
hjzLs_6mqA8,361199,363759,really yes
hjzLs_6mqA8,363759,365759,flat iron steak is forty dollars and
hjzLs_6mqA8,365759,367280,this one right here is about twenty two
hjzLs_6mqA8,367280,369600,dollar steak i as well just like you
hjzLs_6mqA8,369600,371199,like the skirts take a lot better so
hjzLs_6mqA8,371199,372880,this is round one it's not easy to guess
hjzLs_6mqA8,372880,374319,which one is more expensive here's the
hjzLs_6mqA8,374319,375680,thing there's no way i can lose because
hjzLs_6mqA8,375680,378080,i'm eating grilled steak by one of the
hjzLs_6mqA8,378080,380400,world's most renowned steak makers right
hjzLs_6mqA8,380400,382720,here thank you thank you thank you
hjzLs_6mqA8,382720,383840,are you ready for the second one because
hjzLs_6mqA8,383840,385120,i'm excited for you to try let's do it
hjzLs_6mqA8,385120,387759,now the second one i must say
hjzLs_6mqA8,387759,390160,way up on this one this is my favorite
hjzLs_6mqA8,390160,391759,i'll tell you right now this is the
hjzLs_6mqA8,391759,393919,secreto itself and this one right here
hjzLs_6mqA8,393919,396080,is the tenderloin but they're both from
hjzLs_6mqA8,396080,397840,iberico pork which is a very special
hjzLs_6mqA8,397840,399199,kind of pork so the first thing i want
hjzLs_6mqA8,399199,401440,to do is put a nice beautiful sear on
hjzLs_6mqA8,401440,404560,that grill it's pretty hot
hjzLs_6mqA8,405840,407840,now since it's a very lean cut of meat
hjzLs_6mqA8,407840,409120,we're going to baste it with some butter
hjzLs_6mqA8,409120,412000,because butter doesn't hurt anybody just
hjzLs_6mqA8,412000,413599,a little bit we're trying to get a nice
hjzLs_6mqA8,413599,415919,sear
hjzLs_6mqA8,416720,418160,now we got a good sear we're going to be
hjzLs_6mqA8,418160,420400,cooking it in indirect heat until we
hjzLs_6mqA8,420400,425039,reach that internal temperature of 145.
hjzLs_6mqA8,426960,428080,round two
hjzLs_6mqA8,428080,429680,two meats should i start by guessing
hjzLs_6mqA8,429680,431199,what they are absolutely i am very
hjzLs_6mqA8,431199,433199,curious to find out if you can nail this
hjzLs_6mqA8,433199,435039,one it doesn't look like it has a ton of
hjzLs_6mqA8,435039,436560,fat and it took a little bit longer to
hjzLs_6mqA8,436560,438400,cook is this like extra tenderloin it's
hjzLs_6mqA8,438400,440080,a backstrap bedroom yes all right so i
hjzLs_6mqA8,440080,441759,got that you got it this one cooked
hjzLs_6mqA8,441759,443680,super quick much more obvious marbling
hjzLs_6mqA8,443680,445840,inside this is like some kind of wagyu
hjzLs_6mqA8,445840,448000,this is iberico secreto wait so is this
hjzLs_6mqA8,448000,449680,beef no also they're both pork they're
hjzLs_6mqA8,449680,452479,both porks ah okay iberico is a type of
hjzLs_6mqA8,452479,454639,pork that i would like to call the wagyu
hjzLs_6mqA8,454639,457280,of all porks they feed them with acorns
hjzLs_6mqA8,457280,458960,i'm gonna try this right here let's go
hjzLs_6mqA8,458960,460800,of course i definitely want this one i
hjzLs_6mqA8,460800,462400,want for sure i like how you cut it in
hjzLs_6mqA8,462400,465840,half it's so dainty oh
hjzLs_6mqA8,467120,468400,really nice taste on there it almost
hjzLs_6mqA8,468400,469520,tastes like some kind of italian
hjzLs_6mqA8,469520,471520,seasoning believe it or not salt and
hjzLs_6mqA8,471520,472720,pepper i didn't put anything else
hjzLs_6mqA8,472720,474560,because i want you to taste the meat and
hjzLs_6mqA8,474560,476479,not my seasoning or my rub super
hjzLs_6mqA8,476479,478000,delicious it's as good as you're gonna
hjzLs_6mqA8,478000,479520,get the tenderloin to be not my favorite
hjzLs_6mqA8,479520,481360,cut of pork really well because it just
hjzLs_6mqA8,481360,483039,lacks the fat do you think that this
hjzLs_6mqA8,483039,484400,tastes a lot different than a regular
hjzLs_6mqA8,484400,486080,pork that you ever had from a tenderloin
hjzLs_6mqA8,486080,488400,it tastes almost like oregano oregano oh
hjzLs_6mqA8,488400,490240,my god for me it tastes a little bit
hjzLs_6mqA8,490240,491919,sweeter than regular pork yeah i agree
hjzLs_6mqA8,491919,493120,with that are you ready for that one
hjzLs_6mqA8,493120,495120,yeah i'm very ready this one is a little
hjzLs_6mqA8,495120,496560,bit crazy cheers buddy that's good
hjzLs_6mqA8,496560,497620,cheers
hjzLs_6mqA8,497620,499360,[Music]
hjzLs_6mqA8,499360,501280,pork you can also have the intersperse
hjzLs_6mqA8,501280,502960,fan like that yes sir that's so
hjzLs_6mqA8,502960,504720,different it's like a sponge that's just
hjzLs_6mqA8,504720,506400,soaked up a bunch of delicious pork fat
hjzLs_6mqA8,506400,508319,it's flavor on top of flavor on top of
hjzLs_6mqA8,508319,510080,flavor the texture itself is a little
hjzLs_6mqA8,510080,512800,spongy as well like eating uterus uterus
hjzLs_6mqA8,512800,514560,well i've never eaten that dry aged
hjzLs_6mqA8,514560,516880,uterus oh man maybe i should do that
hjzLs_6mqA8,516880,518800,next week so this is a tough one what
hjzLs_6mqA8,518800,520560,cut is that like the jaw but more
hjzLs_6mqA8,520560,522399,towards the shoulder like around here
hjzLs_6mqA8,522399,524480,and there's only one on the pig this is
hjzLs_6mqA8,524480,526240,on both sides of the spine i have to
hjzLs_6mqA8,526240,528000,guess that this one is more expensive
hjzLs_6mqA8,528000,529440,final answer
hjzLs_6mqA8,529440,531279,they cost the same amount
hjzLs_6mqA8,531279,533120,oh
hjzLs_6mqA8,533120,534800,but let's be honest this one right here
hjzLs_6mqA8,534800,537200,is very little this one here comes two
hjzLs_6mqA8,537200,538800,so in essence you are right because you
hjzLs_6mqA8,538800,541040,get a lot less meat but i pay the same
hjzLs_6mqA8,541040,542800,exact amount 200 bucks which one do you
hjzLs_6mqA8,542800,544080,think tastes better come on this one
hjzLs_6mqA8,544080,545680,right here the secreto is absolutely
hjzLs_6mqA8,545680,547120,better this is delicious it's very
hjzLs_6mqA8,547120,549279,unique super heavy though the last round
hjzLs_6mqA8,549279,551279,is it chicken no it's beef all right
hjzLs_6mqA8,551279,552959,forget chicken who likes chicken no i
hjzLs_6mqA8,552959,554800,like chicken
hjzLs_6mqA8,554800,557120,this is as good as it gets we got a
hjzLs_6mqA8,557120,560240,japanese wagyu a5 kobe beef but most
hjzLs_6mqA8,560240,562480,importantly it's dry age and this one
hjzLs_6mqA8,562480,565440,here is also a kobe filament the first
hjzLs_6mqA8,565440,566800,thing i'm going to start is the filet
hjzLs_6mqA8,566800,568800,mignon and we want to get a nice sear
hjzLs_6mqA8,568800,570399,since these steaks are ridiculously
hjzLs_6mqA8,570399,572640,expensive you got to give attention
hjzLs_6mqA8,572640,574399,individually we're looking for medium
hjzLs_6mqA8,574399,576720,rare doneness which is 135 degrees
hjzLs_6mqA8,576720,578800,fahrenheit for both of them we want a
hjzLs_6mqA8,578800,582000,nice golden brown crust all right that's
hjzLs_6mqA8,582000,583279,done we're going to put it here to cook
hjzLs_6mqA8,583279,585120,in indirect heat and it's time to cook
hjzLs_6mqA8,585120,587890,the 1600 steak
hjzLs_6mqA8,587890,591200,[Music]
hjzLs_6mqA8,594560,596640,round three the final round you're
hjzLs_6mqA8,596640,598640,excited i'm so excited is this filet
hjzLs_6mqA8,598640,600080,mignon it is
hjzLs_6mqA8,600080,602240,great over here it looked like some kind
hjzLs_6mqA8,602240,604000,of a wagyu i'm guessing since you
hjzLs_6mqA8,604000,605600,brought it out that it's a5 there you go
hjzLs_6mqA8,605600,607600,a5 correct that's what you got now
hjzLs_6mqA8,607600,609200,there's many different types of wagyu
hjzLs_6mqA8,609200,611120,hokkaido and miyazaki i mean there's so
hjzLs_6mqA8,611120,612640,many which one do you think this one is
hjzLs_6mqA8,612640,616560,kobe yeah you're damn wait really yes
hjzLs_6mqA8,616560,618720,filet mignon almost no fat right mm-hmm
hjzLs_6mqA8,618720,620560,why get this in wagyu if it doesn't have
hjzLs_6mqA8,620560,622399,that intramuscular fat that wag you so
hjzLs_6mqA8,622399,624480,famous for after you try it you answer
hjzLs_6mqA8,624480,627040,that question no joke
hjzLs_6mqA8,627040,633760,[Music]
hjzLs_6mqA8,633760,635360,it's super beefy at the end it has
hjzLs_6mqA8,635360,637040,almost a texture of liver really a
hjzLs_6mqA8,637040,638880,little bit of a liveriness to it in a
hjzLs_6mqA8,638880,640399,good way clear that that there's no
hjzLs_6mqA8,640399,642160,liver taste no it's interesting because
hjzLs_6mqA8,642160,644079,it's super moist you taste plenty of
hjzLs_6mqA8,644079,646320,beef oils without it being super fatty
hjzLs_6mqA8,646320,648079,oh it's fatty that's why you feel all
hjzLs_6mqA8,648079,649839,that juiciness when you bite unlike any
hjzLs_6mqA8,649839,651760,other filament so it is interspersed
hjzLs_6mqA8,651760,653519,with that extremely well marbled you
hjzLs_6mqA8,653519,655519,take a bite it just literally melts in
hjzLs_6mqA8,655519,657600,your mouth and every bite it's like you
hjzLs_6mqA8,657600,659440,don't want to swallow it let's move on
hjzLs_6mqA8,659440,661360,over here this is it you already know
hjzLs_6mqA8,661360,663120,what it is there is something there that
hjzLs_6mqA8,663120,665200,i'm curious to find out your opinion
hjzLs_6mqA8,665200,667519,it's dry aged you've tried a5 before in
hjzLs_6mqA8,667519,669279,kobe okay well now you tell me about
hjzLs_6mqA8,669279,671440,this one how different it is and if it's
hjzLs_6mqA8,671440,673490,any different setup cheers
hjzLs_6mqA8,673490,677040,[Music]
hjzLs_6mqA8,677040,680079,wow yikes that is rich it is rach i mean
hjzLs_6mqA8,680079,682160,super delicious fat overwhelmingly rich
hjzLs_6mqA8,682160,683279,i think i need to take smaller bites
hjzLs_6mqA8,683279,684880,because that was just like a tablespoon
hjzLs_6mqA8,684880,687279,of oil i've just rendered down cow fat
hjzLs_6mqA8,687279,688800,in the back of my throat is it different
hjzLs_6mqA8,688800,690480,from the one you had before i would say
hjzLs_6mqA8,690480,692720,this one is encased in more fat on the
hjzLs_6mqA8,692720,694480,edges and here on the top let me put you
hjzLs_6mqA8,694480,695760,on the spot now which one was better
hjzLs_6mqA8,695760,696800,than one in kobe on the one you're
hjzLs_6mqA8,696800,699760,having it right now be honest okay this
hjzLs_6mqA8,699760,701440,is very nice it's hard to beat the one
hjzLs_6mqA8,701440,703920,in kobe fairy now
hjzLs_6mqA8,703920,705839,and plus i was there with a lovely lady
hjzLs_6mqA8,705839,707040,sorry it's my wife right there holding
hjzLs_6mqA8,707040,708959,the camera i was there with a human
hjzLs_6mqA8,708959,710560,there's a japanese chef across from me
hjzLs_6mqA8,710560,712399,there was fire there was sake i mean if
hjzLs_6mqA8,712399,714079,you plied me down with a few bottles of
hjzLs_6mqA8,714079,715519,sake first you might like this one
hjzLs_6mqA8,715519,717360,better might be a different story now
hjzLs_6mqA8,717360,718959,here's what i'll tell you what you don't
hjzLs_6mqA8,718959,720639,know do you notice a tremendous
hjzLs_6mqA8,720639,721839,difference in flavor it's a bit
hjzLs_6mqA8,721839,723279,different but not super different this
hjzLs_6mqA8,723279,725120,one was dry aged
hjzLs_6mqA8,725120,725920,oh
hjzLs_6mqA8,725920,728240,yes
hjzLs_6mqA8,728880,730480,now you said that i'm like of course it
hjzLs_6mqA8,730480,731279,was
hjzLs_6mqA8,731279,733279,the dry aging is fairly short so it's
hjzLs_6mqA8,733279,734959,just mainly affecting the texture it's
hjzLs_6mqA8,734959,736160,tough to compare it's the same kind of
hjzLs_6mqA8,736160,737200,meat but it's a lot different
hjzLs_6mqA8,737200,739279,preparation so it's a bit different but
hjzLs_6mqA8,739279,740320,here's a point where i need to guess
hjzLs_6mqA8,740320,742839,which one is more exactly i'm
hjzLs_6mqA8,742839,744160,curious um
hjzLs_6mqA8,744160,745680,how much was the fillet so they're not
hjzLs_6mqA8,745680,747920,the same no way
hjzLs_6mqA8,747920,749920,this one's bigger this is always known
hjzLs_6mqA8,749920,753279,as a more expensive cut i gotta say
hjzLs_6mqA8,753279,755040,i think this is more expensive the filet
hjzLs_6mqA8,755040,756240,mignon
hjzLs_6mqA8,756240,759600,no oh my god no way i'm so bad at this
hjzLs_6mqA8,759600,761760,game get some money i'm out
hjzLs_6mqA8,761760,764240,150 300
hjzLs_6mqA8,764240,766160,really 300 off a little piece of steak
hjzLs_6mqA8,766160,769200,like that wow and this one is more way
hjzLs_6mqA8,769200,770720,more now here's what you need to know
hjzLs_6mqA8,770720,772880,whenever you dry aging anything you have
hjzLs_6mqA8,772880,773920,30
hjzLs_6mqA8,773920,775839,loss and then you got to add on your
hjzLs_6mqA8,775839,777839,time and dry aging as well in a
hjzLs_6mqA8,777839,779920,restaurant setting this almost doesn't
hjzLs_6mqA8,779920,781279,exist how much you think they're gonna
hjzLs_6mqA8,781279,782880,charge for that i'm gonna go
hjzLs_6mqA8,782880,784240,550
hjzLs_6mqA8,784240,786720,final answer i'll give you one more
hjzLs_6mqA8,786720,788800,chance to go way higher with the google
hjzLs_6mqA8,788800,791360,tags and his time which is very valuable
hjzLs_6mqA8,791360,792480,um
hjzLs_6mqA8,792480,793760,thousand bucks
hjzLs_6mqA8,793760,796959,more wow sixteen hundred dollars so if i
hjzLs_6mqA8,796959,798399,was in a restaurant i ordered this
hjzLs_6mqA8,798399,799600,they'll probably go like twenty five
hjzLs_6mqA8,799600,801279,hundred dollars just that piece of steak
hjzLs_6mqA8,801279,803360,for example salt bay he charges twenty
hjzLs_6mqA8,803360,805279,five hundred dollars for a tomahawk it's
hjzLs_6mqA8,805279,808000,not even close to this so this could be
hjzLs_6mqA8,808000,810000,off the moon i'm just shooting really
hjzLs_6mqA8,810000,811600,really conservative over here that would
hjzLs_6mqA8,811600,813279,make this the most expensive steak i've
hjzLs_6mqA8,813279,814880,ever eaten in my life i'm about to have
