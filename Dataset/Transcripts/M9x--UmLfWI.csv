M9x--UmLfWI,1520,4231,"I was never the strongest guy, I'm not the fastest guy,"
M9x--UmLfWI,4231,6640,not the smartest guy.
M9x--UmLfWI,6640,8430,But I will work.
M9x--UmLfWI,8430,10490,And I will work hard.
M9x--UmLfWI,10490,13910,"I will be up, when my competitors' asleep,"
M9x--UmLfWI,13910,17400,"I will be up, when my enemy is curled up in bed,"
M9x--UmLfWI,17400,19320,"I will be up getting after it,"
M9x--UmLfWI,19320,24240,and I recommend that you do the same.
M9x--UmLfWI,24240,26330,"People always say, ""You gotta love the work."
M9x--UmLfWI,26330,27520,"You gotta love what you do."""
M9x--UmLfWI,27520,30931,"You don't have to love what do you do, you gotta be f*cking addicted to what you"
M9x--UmLfWI,30931,31931,do.
M9x--UmLfWI,31931,33730,You gotta be addicted to winning.
M9x--UmLfWI,33730,37090,"You cannot work short hours, you gotta work long hours."
M9x--UmLfWI,37090,39840,You gotta work smarter and you gotta work f*cking harder.
M9x--UmLfWI,39840,42640,"It's the work that you put in, the time and effort,"
M9x--UmLfWI,42640,45960,"the dedication, the hours that nobody else saw,"
M9x--UmLfWI,45960,46960,the sacrifices.
M9x--UmLfWI,46960,48570,You have to be disciplined.
M9x--UmLfWI,48570,49860,You have to be obsessive.
M9x--UmLfWI,49860,52149,You have to be addicted to the result.
M9x--UmLfWI,52149,54859,"At the end of the day the person that will surrender,"
M9x--UmLfWI,54860,58290,is the person that didn't work as hard as the other person.
M9x--UmLfWI,58290,59790,You gotta work harder than the other person.
M9x--UmLfWI,59790,62100,So just when you feel like you did that last rep
M9x--UmLfWI,62100,64719,"and your muscles are saying, I can't do no more reps."
M9x--UmLfWI,64719,66819,"You say yeah, you gotta do one more."
M9x--UmLfWI,66819,68960,"'Cause right now, while you're quitting,"
M9x--UmLfWI,68960,70969,he might be doing 5 more.
M9x--UmLfWI,70969,73299,"While you're quitting and giving up, while you're saying alright, I've done enough,"
M9x--UmLfWI,73299,77329,"it's time to rest, he might just be getting in his zone."
M9x--UmLfWI,77329,80389,"If you wanna be great, if you wanna be the baddest motherf*cker ever"
M9x--UmLfWI,80389,83420,"at what you do, you gotta be misunderstood by everybody."
M9x--UmLfWI,83420,87279,"Because you're gonna be so f*cking obsessed and so driven to get there,"
M9x--UmLfWI,87279,88279,that's what it takes.
M9x--UmLfWI,88279,89279,It takes every second of your f*cking life.
M9x--UmLfWI,89279,91859,"Anybody says balance, yeah, balance is important for a lot of f*cking"
M9x--UmLfWI,91859,92859,people.
M9x--UmLfWI,92859,95470,"But if you wanna f*cking go to that edge where people do not like you,"
M9x--UmLfWI,95470,97670,"don't understand you, you're in that spot"
M9x--UmLfWI,97670,99530,of obsession and drive.
M9x--UmLfWI,99530,102899,"To be the best in the world at what you do,"
M9x--UmLfWI,102899,107749,you have to be unbalanced to find every bit of energy and strength that you have
M9x--UmLfWI,107749,109509,to pull it off.
M9x--UmLfWI,109509,111230,"You gotta eat it, you gotta drink it,"
M9x--UmLfWI,111230,113549,"you gotta sleep it, like it has to consume"
M9x--UmLfWI,113549,114549,who you are.
M9x--UmLfWI,114549,117389,"And if you're gonna be the best, the cream of the crop,"
M9x--UmLfWI,117389,119859,"if you're gonna be the apex, you gotta be it,"
M9x--UmLfWI,119859,121179,not talk about it.
M9x--UmLfWI,121179,123619,"And people know when they think about this area,"
M9x--UmLfWI,123619,124889,that's something you do.
M9x--UmLfWI,124889,126340,That you eat and sleep that.
M9x--UmLfWI,126340,128190,And that you do that.
M9x--UmLfWI,128190,129300,You do that.
M9x--UmLfWI,129300,130500,And people know it.
M9x--UmLfWI,130500,132600,"You gotta be it, it has to consume you."
M9x--UmLfWI,132600,134370,It has to take over you.
M9x--UmLfWI,134370,137239,"That when I see you, without even knowing you,"
M9x--UmLfWI,137240,140010,"I ought to be able to look at you, and from your ethos,"
M9x--UmLfWI,140010,141760,I ought to see you are the best to the best.
M9x--UmLfWI,141760,144659,I ought to know what you're doing without you saying one word.
M9x--UmLfWI,144660,146120,It ought to illuminate from you.
M9x--UmLfWI,146120,147790,You've got to work on it.
M9x--UmLfWI,147790,153439,"When other folk are having a good time, you've got to have the strength of character"
M9x--UmLfWI,153440,154440,"to concentrate, to read,"
M9x--UmLfWI,154440,155590,to digest information.
M9x--UmLfWI,155590,159250,"The stronger your mindset is, the greater your skill set"
M9x--UmLfWI,159250,160590,is going to be.
M9x--UmLfWI,160590,165769,"Michael and Kobe weren't the greatest athletes, but their mindset is what separates those"
M9x--UmLfWI,165770,166770,individuals.
M9x--UmLfWI,166770,167770,Separate yourself.
M9x--UmLfWI,167770,168770,"You're playing against other teams and you're doing exactly what they're doing,"
M9x--UmLfWI,168770,169770,separate yourself.
M9x--UmLfWI,169770,170770,Stop doing what they're doing.
M9x--UmLfWI,170770,171770,"If you stop doing what they're doing, you're gonna be a champion."
M9x--UmLfWI,171770,172770,Stop following.
M9x--UmLfWI,172770,173770,No more following.
M9x--UmLfWI,173770,178180,"No more doing what everybody else is doing, set the doggone standard."
M9x--UmLfWI,178180,181879,It's time for y'all to set the standard.
M9x--UmLfWI,181880,182880,We can't be complacent and we can't take
M9x--UmLfWI,182880,185710,our foot off the enemy's throat.
M9x--UmLfWI,185710,190620,We are gonna be relentless.
M9x--UmLfWI,190620,196519,We are not gonna give him
M9x--UmLfWI,196520,200123,"the chance to regroup, he will not get the chance to recover,"
M9x--UmLfWI,200123,201123,we are not going to stop until there is nothing left to pursue.
M9x--UmLfWI,201123,203290,You've gotta do more.
M9x--UmLfWI,203290,207560,You've gotta become valuable.
M9x--UmLfWI,207560,214819,You've gotta understand that what you get paid to do
M9x--UmLfWI,214820,215820,is the minimum.
M9x--UmLfWI,215820,216820,"And everything on top of that, is your investment"
M9x--UmLfWI,216820,217820,in your future.
M9x--UmLfWI,217820,218820,"Getting out of bed, coming here in the morning, going for it, when everyone else is sleeping,"
M9x--UmLfWI,218820,219820,puts yourself in the opportunity to get that break.
M9x--UmLfWI,219820,222230,"So the more sh*t your throw against the wall, something will eventually stick."
M9x--UmLfWI,222230,224340,It doesn't stick dreaming and sh*t about it.
M9x--UmLfWI,224340,226321,"The first step into making a dream a reality,"
M9x--UmLfWI,226321,227409,is waking the f*ck up.
