yxYk0BZ9274,4035,5271,Delivery!
yxYk0BZ9274,5872,8441,"- Here you go, Blaze. - Thanks, Millard."
yxYk0BZ9274,8575,13212,"Check it out, it's my brand new video game!"
yxYk0BZ9274,13646,15514, Let's turn on the video game!
yxYk0BZ9274,15648,18685, Do you know which shape on  the video game is a rectangle?
yxYk0BZ9274,19252,21521," That's the one, great pick!"
yxYk0BZ9274,22555,25758, We need to find three keys  in order to free the dragon
yxYk0BZ9274,25891,27193, from the tower.
yxYk0BZ9274,28094,29695,"Oh, me first! Me first!"
yxYk0BZ9274,29862,32898,[laughing] This is gonna be so much fun!
yxYk0BZ9274,33032,35301,"Uh, Crusher? Be careful!"
yxYk0BZ9274,35435,36969,You're headed for that puddle!
yxYk0BZ9274,37102,38771,[screaming]
yxYk0BZ9274,39572,43410,It looks like something funny is happening to the video game.
yxYk0BZ9274,45044,46477,- Whoo! - Ho-ho!
yxYk0BZ9274,46612,50216,"Gaskets, the three keys just came out of the game!"
yxYk0BZ9274,50349,51718,"Hey, don't worry, dragon."
yxYk0BZ9274,51851,54187,We're still going to get you out of that tower.
yxYk0BZ9274,54320,55221,I promise.
yxYk0BZ9274,55354,58625,Video game heroes!
yxYk0BZ9274,58758,59826,[shouting]
yxYk0BZ9274,59959,63063,"Listen, that sounds like one of the keys now."
yxYk0BZ9274,64096,66332,[gasping] It's the Speedy Key!
yxYk0BZ9274,68668,71871,- Hubcaps! - That is one fast key.
yxYk0BZ9274,72171,73906,But I know how we can catch it.
yxYk0BZ9274,74039,76575,"Look, wherever the key goes"
yxYk0BZ9274,76709,79745,it leaves behind shapes with special powers.
yxYk0BZ9274,80580,84383,And if we find the right shapes they'll give us speed power
yxYk0BZ9274,84517,86952,so we can go just as fast as the key.
yxYk0BZ9274,87754,90789,"Yeah, and I know how to find the shapes we need."
yxYk0BZ9274,90923,93292,We'll use geometry!
yxYk0BZ9274,94660,98531,Geometry is the part of math that teaches us about shapes.
yxYk0BZ9274,98698,101734," In order to get speed power,  we need to find a shape"
yxYk0BZ9274,101867,103236, with three sides.
yxYk0BZ9274,103369,105672, Which one of these shapes  has three sides?
yxYk0BZ9274,107340,108575, Right!
yxYk0BZ9274,108708,111110," One, two, three."
yxYk0BZ9274,111477,113379, What is this shape called?
yxYk0BZ9274,114147,115715,"A triangle, yeah!"
yxYk0BZ9274,115848,119384,"Come on, help me look for triangle power shapes!"
yxYk0BZ9274,119752,123623,"When you see a triangle, say, ""Triangle!"""
yxYk0BZ9274,124323,125725,Triangle!
yxYk0BZ9274,128259,129828,"Oh, yeah!"
yxYk0BZ9274,130996,132632,- Yeah! - Whoo-hoo!
yxYk0BZ9274,134133,135767,Yeah!
yxYk0BZ9274,138404,140607,We got the Speedy Key!
yxYk0BZ9274,142374,144777,"All right, it worked!"
yxYk0BZ9274,145878,148681,The key opened the first lock on the tower!
yxYk0BZ9274,148814,151917,Video game heroes!
yxYk0BZ9274,152284,154519,[honking]
yxYk0BZ9274,154887,156122,"Keep a lookout, AJ,"
yxYk0BZ9274,156256,158791,we've still got two more keys to find.
yxYk0BZ9274,158924,160560,[giggling]
yxYk0BZ9274,160760,161894,Do you hear that?
yxYk0BZ9274,162194,163296,[laughing]
yxYk0BZ9274,163429,165265,The Hiding Key!
yxYk0BZ9274,167332,171838,"Look, the key just turned green to hide by that green dumpster."
yxYk0BZ9274,174740,178545,"Oh, man, this time it's turning... maroon!"
yxYk0BZ9274,179778,181614,Where do you see the color maroon?
yxYk0BZ9274,184483,186185,"That box, yeah!"
yxYk0BZ9274,186385,187853,[laughing]
yxYk0BZ9274,188287,190456,"Not so fast, Hiding Key."
yxYk0BZ9274,190823,191957,We gotcha!
yxYk0BZ9274,192591,195728,It's opening up the second lock on the tower!
yxYk0BZ9274,196729,198064,[laughing]
yxYk0BZ9274,198197,201734,"To free the dragon, we just need one more key."
yxYk0BZ9274,202968,204570,Yeah!
yxYk0BZ9274,204937,206004,[giggling]
yxYk0BZ9274,206139,208174,"Hang on, AJ, do you hear that?"
yxYk0BZ9274,208441,211778,"Yeah, it sounds like the Magic Key!"
yxYk0BZ9274,212879,216248,"Uh-oh, it looks like the key's doing a magic spell."
yxYk0BZ9274,216481,218251,A spell to make...
yxYk0BZ9274,218984,220385,a cannon!
yxYk0BZ9274,223656,225258,- Ah! - Whoa!
yxYk0BZ9274,228027,229428,"Yee, ah!"
yxYk0BZ9274,229795,230996,Whoa!
yxYk0BZ9274,231764,234400,"Oh, man, if we're gonna get that key,"
yxYk0BZ9274,234533,237370,we've gotta find some way to get past this cannon.
yxYk0BZ9274,237503,239339,"Hey, I've got an idea."
yxYk0BZ9274,239572,242541,Let's use a shield to knock those cannonballs away!
yxYk0BZ9274,242708,245812,"Yeah, we can build one out of shapes!"
yxYk0BZ9274,246112,248080,We'll use geometry!
yxYk0BZ9274,249215,251851," First, let's drag over  the pentagon."
yxYk0BZ9274,253519,254754, Nice!
yxYk0BZ9274,255288,256622, Now drag over the triangle
yxYk0BZ9274,256756,259325, to fill in  the four triangle spaces.
yxYk0BZ9274,261260,262595, Great job!
yxYk0BZ9274,263796,265130,"Oh, yeah!"
yxYk0BZ9274,265264,268768,We made a Monster Machine shield!
yxYk0BZ9274,273773,276542,- Whoo-hoo! - It's shield time!
yxYk0BZ9274,278844,280280,[grunting]
yxYk0BZ9274,283449,285851,"- Yeah! - You did it, Blaze!"
yxYk0BZ9274,285985,287386,We've almost got it!
yxYk0BZ9274,287987,289956,But it looks like we're going to have to get past
yxYk0BZ9274,290089,291624,one last magic spell.
yxYk0BZ9274,291757,295762,A spell that makes... giant bubbles!
yxYk0BZ9274,298231,300599,"Whoa, yee, ah!"
yxYk0BZ9274,300733,301567,Whoa!
yxYk0BZ9274,302001,305037,"- Whoa-hoa-hoa! - Whoa, whoa!"
yxYk0BZ9274,305237,306538,"Phew, we're going to need"
yxYk0BZ9274,306672,308974,something that can pop those bubbles.
yxYk0BZ9274,309107,310409,"Hey, I know."
yxYk0BZ9274,310809,314479,Let's use geometry to make a sword!
yxYk0BZ9274,315548,316882, Drag over the triangle
yxYk0BZ9274,317016,319352, to fill in  the three triangle spaces.
yxYk0BZ9274,322588,324823,- Whoa! - Next drag over the rectangle
yxYk0BZ9274,324957,327427, to fill in  the two rectangle spaces.
yxYk0BZ9274,328460,329694, Awesome work!
yxYk0BZ9274,329829,331831," Last, drag over  the parallelogram"
yxYk0BZ9274,331964,334901, to fill in  the four parallelogram spaces.
yxYk0BZ9274,336435,337737, Cool sword!
yxYk0BZ9274,337870,339138,"Oh, yeah!"
yxYk0BZ9274,339271,342741,We made a Monster Machine sword!
yxYk0BZ9274,342975,344176,All right!
yxYk0BZ9274,344310,346746,Let's go pop some bubbles!
yxYk0BZ9274,349214,351818,- Whoo-hoo! - Yeah!
yxYk0BZ9274,354253,355421,"Way to go, Blaze!"
yxYk0BZ9274,355554,357789,"Now there's only one bubble left,"
yxYk0BZ9274,358023,360926,but it's floating away with the magic key inside!
yxYk0BZ9274,362061,364597,"Well, that key is not getting away this time,"
yxYk0BZ9274,364730,367567,because we've got Blazing Speed.
yxYk0BZ9274,369735,374840,"To give me Blazing Speed, say, ""Let's Blaze!"""
yxYk0BZ9274,375107,377910,Let's Blaze!
yxYk0BZ9274,388654,391557,- Whoo-hoo! - We got the key!
yxYk0BZ9274,392024,395261,"Look, it's going back into the video game!"
yxYk0BZ9274,395628,397595,And it's heading toward the last lock!
yxYk0BZ9274,397730,399966,[electronic sounds]
yxYk0BZ9274,403535,405304,[dragon cheering] It worked!
yxYk0BZ9274,405437,407407,The dragon's free!
yxYk0BZ9274,409975,412078,"- Whoo-hoo! - We did it, AJ!"
yxYk0BZ9274,412211,415281,We rescued the dragon and won the game!
yxYk0BZ9274,415981,418617,"Whoa, I wonder what's happening now."
yxYk0BZ9274,421253,422354,Whoa!
yxYk0BZ9274,422487,424123,It's the dragon!
yxYk0BZ9274,424257,426024,He's here in Axle City!
yxYk0BZ9274,426158,428461,[dragon cheering]
yxYk0BZ9274,431898,433733, Thanks for playing!
yxYk0BZ9274,434633,435968,That strange.
yxYk0BZ9274,436102,438203,What's all this stuff falling from the sky?
yxYk0BZ9274,438337,439906,They're just snowflakes.
yxYk0BZ9274,440039,442441,Snowflakes are made out of ice crystals.
yxYk0BZ9274,442574,443575,Yeah.
yxYk0BZ9274,444176,446779,"Up in the clouds, when it gets really cold"
yxYk0BZ9274,446913,448414,tiny ice crystals form.
yxYk0BZ9274,448547,450682, Ice crystals have six sides.
yxYk0BZ9274,450816,454319,Which of these two ice crystals  has six sides?
yxYk0BZ9274,455153,457690," Yeah, the ice crystal  on the left!"
yxYk0BZ9274,458123,460358,"And when the crystals fall from the cloud,"
yxYk0BZ9274,460493,462494,their sides get bigger and bigger
yxYk0BZ9274,462628,466031,until they become snowflakes.
yxYk0BZ9274,468166,469501,[screaming]
yxYk0BZ9274,469635,472104,"My, what a strange looking snowman."
yxYk0BZ9274,472238,475240,"That's not a snowman, that's Crusher!"
yxYk0BZ9274,475374,478177,And he's headed right for the hot chocolate!
yxYk0BZ9274,479078,480112,"Oh, no!"
yxYk0BZ9274,480245,481347,Uh-oh!
yxYk0BZ9274,481480,482614,The hot chocolate!
yxYk0BZ9274,482748,483815,It's flying away!
yxYk0BZ9274,483949,487052,I want hot chocolate!
yxYk0BZ9274,487519,489121,"Hoppin' hubcaps,"
yxYk0BZ9274,489254,491824,he's trying to get the hot chocolate for himself!
yxYk0BZ9274,491957,494160,Not if I get there first.
yxYk0BZ9274,494327,496428,"AJ, give me some speed."
yxYk0BZ9274,496562,498764,"- Go, Blaze! - Yay!"
yxYk0BZ9274,498898,501667,"Look out, Blaze! Snow sharks!"
yxYk0BZ9274,502101,503703,[giggling]
yxYk0BZ9274,504569,506204,[screaming]
yxYk0BZ9274,507172,510442,Hubcaps! Crusher must have made these snow sharks
yxYk0BZ9274,510576,513346,to try and stop us from getting the hot chocolate.
yxYk0BZ9274,513479,515114,[giggling]
yxYk0BZ9274,516648,518182,"Hey, I've got an idea."
yxYk0BZ9274,518317,522120,Let's build something that can blast those sharks far away.
yxYk0BZ9274,522387,524856,We'll make a snow cannon.
yxYk0BZ9274,525223,526592,Yeah!
yxYk0BZ9274,526725,530362,"Snow cannons use water to make tiny six-sided ice crystals,"
yxYk0BZ9274,530496,534366,then they blast the ice crystals and water out into the air.
yxYk0BZ9274,534700,537202,The water freezes on the sides of the crystals
yxYk0BZ9274,537336,539137,so they become snowflakes.
yxYk0BZ9274,539271,542874,"And with enough snowflakes, we can make a huge snowball,"
yxYk0BZ9274,543041,544977,big enough to roll those sharks away.
yxYk0BZ9274,545110,546912,"Come on, let's get building."
yxYk0BZ9274,547045,551183,"First, drag over the water tank  so blaze can hold water."
yxYk0BZ9274,551717,552717, Great work!
yxYk0BZ9274,552851,554654,Water tank!
yxYk0BZ9274,555688,557523,Now we need an air compressor.
yxYk0BZ9274,557656,559158, Drag over the air compressor
yxYk0BZ9274,559292,563029,to help Blaze break up the water  into teeny tiny drops.
yxYk0BZ9274,563829,565031, Nice job!
yxYk0BZ9274,565164,566933,Air compressor!
yxYk0BZ9274,567833,569835,"And last, we need a fan."
yxYk0BZ9274,569968,571270, Drag over the fan
yxYk0BZ9274,571403,573105, to help Blaze  blow the water drops
yxYk0BZ9274,573239,576676, into the cold air  so they become ice crystals.
yxYk0BZ9274,577342,578777, You did it!
yxYk0BZ9274,579912,585618,"Oh, yeah! I'm a Snow Cannon Monster Machine!"
yxYk0BZ9274,586051,587219,Yeah!
yxYk0BZ9274,588220,589188,All right!
yxYk0BZ9274,592257,593659,[giggling]
yxYk0BZ9274,598096,599932,Whoo-hoo!
yxYk0BZ9274,601433,602868,[giggling]
yxYk0BZ9274,603368,605070,Just one snow shark left.
yxYk0BZ9274,605504,609342,"When you see the last shark, say, ""Snow shark!"""
yxYk0BZ9274,615147,616381,Snow shark!
yxYk0BZ9274,616515,617717,[giggling] Chomp!
yxYk0BZ9274,618384,620019,"Chomp, chomp, chomp!"
yxYk0BZ9274,624089,625457,- Yeah! - Whoo-hoo!
yxYk0BZ9274,625591,626891,"We did it, Blaze!"
yxYk0BZ9274,627025,629862,Snow sharks? Snow problem.
yxYk0BZ9274,631496,632931,Now let's keep moving.
yxYk0BZ9274,633065,635701,We've got to get to that hot chocolate before Crusher.
yxYk0BZ9274,636201,637303,Whoo-hoo!
yxYk0BZ9274,637436,641073,[groans] I need something to stop that guy.
yxYk0BZ9274,641506,644342,"Or better yet, three somethings."
yxYk0BZ9274,644610,646946,[giggles] I'll make...
yxYk0BZ9274,648213,651384,three snowball-throwing robots!
yxYk0BZ9274,658224,659458,"Blaze, watch out!"
yxYk0BZ9274,659592,662294,"Whoa, yah, oh!"
yxYk0BZ9274,664330,669235,"Gaskets, those robots are trying to hit us with giant snowballs!"
yxYk0BZ9274,669734,671036,[honking]
yxYk0BZ9274,671203,673738,Sounds like you could use some help.
yxYk0BZ9274,673872,675675,It's our friends!
yxYk0BZ9274,677576,679345,"Well, howdy, partners."
yxYk0BZ9274,679912,681079,I've got an idea.
yxYk0BZ9274,681213,683749,"Look, the robots have buttons on them."
yxYk0BZ9274,683916,685651,I bet if we can push those buttons
yxYk0BZ9274,685784,686952,the robots will turn off.
yxYk0BZ9274,687085,688988," This robot has three buttons,"
yxYk0BZ9274,689121,692022, so to turn it off  we need three snowballs.
yxYk0BZ9274,692157,695161, Let's drag three snowballs  over to the platform.
yxYk0BZ9274,696795,698196, One...
yxYk0BZ9274,700432,701834, Two...
yxYk0BZ9274,703735,705437,Three! Is that enough snowballs
yxYk0BZ9274,705571,708373, to turn off the robot  with three buttons?
yxYk0BZ9274,709708,711043," Yeah, it is!"
yxYk0BZ9274,717183,719050,- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! - All right!
yxYk0BZ9274,719184,721186,We shut off the first robot!

yxYk0BZ9274,962961,964430,[laughing]
yxYk0BZ9274,965731,967366,[robot noises]
yxYk0BZ9274,970102,971937,I've got to stop those robots
yxYk0BZ9274,972070,973838,before they wreck the whole city.
yxYk0BZ9274,974205,975340,"Come on, everyone."
yxYk0BZ9274,975474,978276,It's time to use robotics!
yxYk0BZ9274,978409,979878,- Yeah! - Whoo-hoo!
yxYk0BZ9274,980011,981146,Whoa!
yxYk0BZ9274,981280,984216,Robotics step one: Design our robot.
yxYk0BZ9274,984583,988320,"I know, let's give our robot legs so he can run and jump."
yxYk0BZ9274,988820,991690, Drag over the robot legs  to start building.
yxYk0BZ9274,994626,995727, Great!
yxYk0BZ9274,995860,998664,"Now let's give our robot a big, powerful body."
yxYk0BZ9274,998797,1002534, Now drag over the robot body  to continue building.
yxYk0BZ9274,1004402,1005704, Awesome building!
yxYk0BZ9274,1006138,1010142,"Oh, oh! And what if our robot could have super strong arms?"
yxYk0BZ9274,1016214,1017449,All right!
yxYk0BZ9274,1017583,1019818,Now we're ready for robotics step two:
yxYk0BZ9274,1020051,1021320,Build the robot.
yxYk0BZ9274,1022387,1024322,"Hey, I've got an idea."
yxYk0BZ9274,1024656,1027692,Let's build these robot parts on me.
yxYk0BZ9274,1027991,1031695,I'll be a Robot Monster Machine!
yxYk0BZ9274,1031829,1034298, Drag Blaze  over to the robot parts
yxYk0BZ9274,1034432,1037469, to turn him into  a Robot Monster Machine!
yxYk0BZ9274,1038303,1039738,Robo-tastic!
yxYk0BZ9274,1043208,1047613,I'm... Robot Blaze!
yxYk0BZ9274,1048880,1050182,Whoa!
yxYk0BZ9274,1050415,1053152,"Okay, even I have to admit that's pretty cool."
yxYk0BZ9274,1053318,1054686,"Hop in, AJ."
yxYk0BZ9274,1056154,1057356,All right!
yxYk0BZ9274,1057489,1059992,Now we're ready for robotics step three:
yxYk0BZ9274,1060125,1061459,Code our robot!
yxYk0BZ9274,1061593,1064095, Coding means giving instructions to a robot.
yxYk0BZ9274,1064462,1068534, Let's code Robot Blaze  to run and then lift.
yxYk0BZ9274,1068834,1071536," This symbol will tell  Robot Blaze to run,"
yxYk0BZ9274,1071836,1074673," this symbol tells  Robot Blaze to lift,"
yxYk0BZ9274,1074939,1078809, and this symbol  tells Robot Blaze to smash.
yxYk0BZ9274,1079110,1081179,Which two symbols should we pick
yxYk0BZ9274,1081313,1085450, to code Robot Blaze  to run and lift?
yxYk0BZ9274,1086918,1091156, Great! That symbol  will code Robot Blaze to run.
yxYk0BZ9274,1092524,1095727, That symbol will code  Robot Blaze to lift.
yxYk0BZ9274,1095860,1096928, Great coding!
yxYk0BZ9274,1097295,1101133,Coding Robot Blaze to run and lift.
yxYk0BZ9274,1109241,1111008,- Ya-hoo! - All right!
yxYk0BZ9274,1111142,1112577,"Come on, AJ,"
yxYk0BZ9274,1112711,1115914,time to save Axle City from those wrecking robots.
yxYk0BZ9274,1116047,1117549,Let's go for it!
yxYk0BZ9274,1117716,1119951,Robot... power!
yxYk0BZ9274,1120285,1122454,- Wa-hoo! - Yeah!
yxYk0BZ9274,1123054,1123920,[grunting]
yxYk0BZ9274,1124322,1126692,"- Yooh! - Blaze, watch out!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1129461,1131329,"Uh-oh, that throwing robot"
yxYk0BZ9274,1131463,1133365,is throwing two things this time.
yxYk0BZ9274,1133498,1136902,Help me code Blaze's arms to do two smashes.
yxYk0BZ9274,1138370,1140873,Which of these is two smashes?
yxYk0BZ9274,1143541,1145777,"Yeah, that's a group of two."
yxYk0BZ9274,1145911,1151283,"So our new code is: Go, smash, smash, stop!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1153151,1154419,Go!
yxYk0BZ9274,1154652,1155687,Smash!
yxYk0BZ9274,1155987,1157322,Smash!
yxYk0BZ9274,1157622,1158356,Stop.
yxYk0BZ9274,1158489,1160324,- Whoo-hoo! - Yeah!
yxYk0BZ9274,1160458,1163762,"Look, the throwing robot is just up ahead!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1165764,1166698,Yoo-hoo!
yxYk0BZ9274,1166832,1169868,"Lug nuts, he juts threw four things!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1171569,1174372,Which of these is four smashes?
yxYk0BZ9274,1177408,1180011,"Yeah, that's it! All right!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1180145,1181579,So now our code is:
yxYk0BZ9274,1181846,1187351,"Go, smash, smash, smash, smash, stop!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1189888,1190955,Go!
yxYk0BZ9274,1191122,1196495,"Smash, smash, smash, smash!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1196628,1197896,And stop!
yxYk0BZ9274,1203267,1204335,Yeah!
yxYk0BZ9274,1204469,1206772,We stopped the throwing robot!
yxYk0BZ9274,1206938,1210709,That means there's only one robot left to find:
yxYk0BZ9274,1210876,1212510,the blasting robot!
yxYk0BZ9274,1212711,1215480,"We can stop him, because we've got..."
yxYk0BZ9274,1215747,1218148,robot power!
yxYk0BZ9274,1218483,1220018,"Looking good, Blaze!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1220152,1221787,You the robot!
yxYk0BZ9274,1222987,1224856,"Hubcaps, there he is!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1224990,1226391,The blasting robot!
yxYk0BZ9274,1226791,1230428,"Whoa, his blast is really powerful."
yxYk0BZ9274,1230929,1231896,Check it out.
yxYk0BZ9274,1232697,1234966,This robot sends a powerful blast
yxYk0BZ9274,1235100,1236367,"from an opening in his belly,"
yxYk0BZ9274,1236768,1239037,"but if we can plug that opening,"
yxYk0BZ9274,1239170,1240839,he won't be able to blast anymore.
yxYk0BZ9274,1240972,1244909, Which object will fit over the belly of the blasting robot?
yxYk0BZ9274,1245043,1247479, The wheel or the box?
yxYk0BZ9274,1248613,1250148," Yeah, the wheel!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1250348,1251850, Awesome job!
yxYk0BZ9274,1253051,1254686,[beeping]
yxYk0BZ9274,1256287,1257789,"Thanks, little friend."
yxYk0BZ9274,1261292,1262995,Hoo-hoo!
yxYk0BZ9274,1263962,1265163,[grunting]
yxYk0BZ9274,1265797,1269500,"The robot's blast is pushing with a force of nine,"
yxYk0BZ9274,1270134,1272103,and my force is five.
yxYk0BZ9274,1272370,1275340,"Which is more, five or nine?"
yxYk0BZ9274,1278142,1279309,"Nine, yeah!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1279577,1282480,The robot's blast has more force!
yxYk0BZ9274,1282914,1283847,[grunting]
yxYk0BZ9274,1283981,1285248,Whoa!
yxYk0BZ9274,1285917,1289187, We need more force to get past the blasting robot.
yxYk0BZ9274,1289320,1293524," To give Blaze more force,  let's give him Blazing Speed."
yxYk0BZ9274,1295059,1297929,Let's Blaze!
yxYk0BZ9274,1302267,1303934,[robot laugh]
yxYk0BZ9274,1308540,1309941,[grunting]
yxYk0BZ9274,1310408,1313044,"Look, my force went up to ten!"
yxYk0BZ9274,1313612,1315947,And the robot's blast is nine.
yxYk0BZ9274,1316247,1319084,Which is more? Ten or nine?
yxYk0BZ9274,1321819,1326558,Ten! That means I've got more force!
yxYk0BZ9274,1327825,1328794,Yeah!
yxYk0BZ9274,1330161,1331463,[grunting]
yxYk0BZ9274,1333064,1334265,Whoa-oh!
