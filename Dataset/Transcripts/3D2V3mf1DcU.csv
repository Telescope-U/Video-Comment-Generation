3D2V3mf1DcU,0,4480,Hello everyone it's SpawnPoiint so the all-new  playstation plus has finally launched worldwide  
3D2V3mf1DcU,4480,8800,with the uk and europe getting it yesterday and  with this new ps plus we now have hundreds of  
3D2V3mf1DcU,8800,14720,"new games including ps1, 2, 3, 4, ps5 and psp.  Well today we're going to take a look at the  "
3D2V3mf1DcU,14720,19520,three new tiers see what the main differences are  what games we actually get and ultimately which is  
3D2V3mf1DcU,19520,24000,the best option to go for right now so if you're  not sure whether you need to go for the essential  
3D2V3mf1DcU,24000,28160,extra or premium plan hopefully today's video  will help you decide and if you haven't already  
3D2V3mf1DcU,28160,32800,please drop a like on this video and subscribe  if you want to see more playstation videos now  
3D2V3mf1DcU,32800,37840,previously ps plus was a one tier system which  you subscribe to to play online multiplayer get  
3D2V3mf1DcU,37840,41520,discounts to games and download those monthly  games and then if you wanted to you could  
3D2V3mf1DcU,41520,46240,then subscribe to ps now separately well they've  kind of combined these two services into one but  
3D2V3mf1DcU,46240,50960,they've split them out into three different tiers  we've got premium extra and essential each comes  
3D2V3mf1DcU,50960,55199,with different pricing and different options which  one you think is best depends entirely if you see  
3D2V3mf1DcU,55200,59520,value in the different benefits and remember that  everything that you see in the essential plan is  
3D2V3mf1DcU,59520,64160,included in the higher tiers as well and then  everything in extra is also included in premium  
3D2V3mf1DcU,64879,69039,now i'm in the uk so the pricing is obviously in  pounds but here are the different costs if you  
3D2V3mf1DcU,69040,75200,want to pay monthly it comes in at 13 pounds 49  for premium 10 pounds 99 for extra and 6.99 for  
3D2V3mf1DcU,75200,78880,essential if you want to pay every three months  instead it comes in slightly cheaper and you're  
3D2V3mf1DcU,78880,83119,saving around 20 to 30 pence per month and  finally the yearly subscription is where you  
3D2V3mf1DcU,83120,89360,actually save the most so the premium works out at  eight pounds 34 per month instead of 13.49 extra  
3D2V3mf1DcU,89360,94480,works out at seven pounds instead of 10.99 and  essential comes in at four pounds 17 instead of  
3D2V3mf1DcU,94480,99360,6.99 but you are obviously paying these annually  not every month now i had actually previously  
3D2V3mf1DcU,99360,104000,stacked some ps now and ps plus subscriptions  from before so with the new tier system they've  
3D2V3mf1DcU,104000,108080,actually automatically converted me onto the  premium plan and jumping into the subscriptions  
3D2V3mf1DcU,108080,113200,area in settings you can see here now that i've  got the premium until august the 1st 2025. so  
3D2V3mf1DcU,113200,117039,it's great to see that they have automatically  converted me onto the premium plan but that's  
3D2V3mf1DcU,117040,120720,definitely something worth checking out in  your own plan if you were a previous subscriber  
3D2V3mf1DcU,121280,124960,okay let's take a quick look around the  new ps plus menu and see what we get  
3D2V3mf1DcU,124960,129600,so we've got buttons off to the game catalog the  classic games game trials and a few others and  
3D2V3mf1DcU,129600,133040,then all of the benefits are shown underneath  which we will go over in a minute then under  
3D2V3mf1DcU,133040,136560,this we've got various other things like the  classic games are listed we've got the game  
3D2V3mf1DcU,136560,141120,trials we've got must play games as well as some  recommendations for other games you should play  
3D2V3mf1DcU,141120,144239,so as you scroll around here you can see all of  the different games available and the different  
3D2V3mf1DcU,144240,148240,categories as well but if we tab across the top  here you can actually go through the benefits of  
3D2V3mf1DcU,148240,151840,playstation plus all of these we will obviously  cover in today's video and then next you've got  
3D2V3mf1DcU,151840,156319,the collections tab now these are all the games  available split out into different genres and  
3D2V3mf1DcU,156320,159920,platforms and this is definitely the best  way to navigate through all of the available  
3D2V3mf1DcU,159920,164640,games now there is a view all games area but  it's a huge list of games to scroll through  
3D2V3mf1DcU,165280,168880,okay so that's the navigation and kind of what  the menu looks like but let's dive straight into  
3D2V3mf1DcU,168880,173040,the different plans that are available so first  up we got the essential plan which is basically  
3D2V3mf1DcU,173040,177920,a replacement of the ps plus that we had before  we get the monthly games online multiplayer the  
3D2V3mf1DcU,177920,183120,playstation plus collection discounts and cloud  storage so if you were a ps plus subscriber before  
3D2V3mf1DcU,183120,187200,this is exactly what you're used to already now  the playstation plus collection includes some of  
3D2V3mf1DcU,187200,192239,the best playstation 4 games that there are games  like crash bandicoot god of war final fantasy  
3D2V3mf1DcU,192240,196720,and the last of us in total there are 19 games  included with this plan and i'll tell you what if  
3D2V3mf1DcU,196720,201120,you've not played god of war yet definitely give  this one a go now the essential plan does also  
3D2V3mf1DcU,201120,206879,come with cloud storage that's 100 gigabytes for  ps4 and 100 gigabytes for ps5 games and this lets  
3D2V3mf1DcU,206880,211040,you back up your game data to the cloud in case  you need it again in the future and we also get  
3D2V3mf1DcU,211040,215280,those monthly games so whether the games are worth  downloading varies from month to month but it's  
3D2V3mf1DcU,215280,219440,always worth adding them to your library just in  case and then the essential plan also comes with  
3D2V3mf1DcU,219440,223680,exclusive discounts to certain games or add-ons  so if there are some games you were thinking of  
3D2V3mf1DcU,223680,228000,buying and there's a discount available signing up  to the essential plan will make the most sense so  
3D2V3mf1DcU,228000,231760,as you can tell the essential plan really is no  different to the playstation plus that we've had  
3D2V3mf1DcU,231760,236080,before but as the next two plans is where you  will see the differences okay so then there's  
3D2V3mf1DcU,236080,240000,the extra plan so this gets you everything  that we saw in the essential plan but it also  
3D2V3mf1DcU,240000,244720,unlocks the game catalog and this is where we  see hundreds of playstation 4 and playstation 5  
3D2V3mf1DcU,244720,249440,games added how it works is as long as you have an  active subscription you can download and play any  
3D2V3mf1DcU,249440,253920,of these games while you're on the extra or the  premium plan some of these games are well worth  
3D2V3mf1DcU,253920,259200,the money for the sub games like spider-man miles  morales assassins creed demon souls and ghost of  
3D2V3mf1DcU,259200,263280,sashima i mean as i scroll through this list  now you can see just how many we get some of  
3D2V3mf1DcU,263280,266720,these are actually part of the playstation plus  collection that you get in the essential tier  
3D2V3mf1DcU,266720,270560,so games like days gone and god of war well you  would have got those anyway but otherwise all  
3D2V3mf1DcU,270560,274800,of these are included now i'm actually seeing a  few duplicates here as well so maybe 10 or so are  
3D2V3mf1DcU,274800,278400,duplicates now i'll just keep scrolling through  this list you can see all of the games that are  
3D2V3mf1DcU,278400,282080,available on the extra plan now there are some  games in here that i've never played before in  
3D2V3mf1DcU,282080,286159,fact some of these games i've never even heard of  so i will likely download these to give them a go  
3D2V3mf1DcU,286160,293120,okay so in total i make it 367 games or included  in the game catalog now that might be out by 10 or  
3D2V3mf1DcU,293120,297440,20 or so and there are definitely a few duplicates  as well as some of the ps collection games but  
3D2V3mf1DcU,297440,301360,this definitely gives you an idea at least of the  number of games and the games included within this  
3D2V3mf1DcU,301360,304960,catalog now when you're ready to download any  of these games you just head over to the game  
3D2V3mf1DcU,304960,309120,page and you can see a download button with a ps  symbol next to it and that's it we've now got this  
3D2V3mf1DcU,309120,313760,game at no extra cost so this game catalog that  we've just gone through is literally the one and  
3D2V3mf1DcU,313760,317840,only feature that sets the extra plan apart from  the essential plan but for the extra that you're  
3D2V3mf1DcU,317840,322800,paying for you are getting hundreds of ps4 and  ps5 games all you need to do is download what  
3D2V3mf1DcU,322800,327680,maybe two or three of these and it's pretty much  paid for itself next up we've got the premium plan  
3D2V3mf1DcU,327680,331680,now this is the top tier option which includes  everything that we've seen so far in today's  
3D2V3mf1DcU,331680,336800,video plus these added benefits so we've got the  classic catalog we've got the game trials as well  
3D2V3mf1DcU,336800,340879,as cloud streaming whether these three features  are worth it to you i guess comes down to the  
3D2V3mf1DcU,340880,345120,value of the games but the number one feature for  most is probably going to be the classic library  
3D2V3mf1DcU,345120,350720,this unlocks hundreds of ps1 ps2 and psp games now  i'm scrolling through the list now and you're able  
3D2V3mf1DcU,350720,354560,to see all of the games included there are a few  old ones here that i'll remember playing back on  
3D2V3mf1DcU,354560,359280,the ps1 as well as the ps2 so here's toy story 2  for example and these games can then be downloaded  
3D2V3mf1DcU,359280,363120,as you would expect to do with any previous  game and you can play them as long as you have  
3D2V3mf1DcU,363120,368000,an active sub so i was actually expecting far more  games to be included but i guess it is early days  
3D2V3mf1DcU,368000,374240,i make the total count of these classic ps1 ps2  and psp games to be just 37 games hopefully over  
3D2V3mf1DcU,374240,378639,the coming months we'll see more and more games  added i would like to see the original driver for  
3D2V3mf1DcU,378640,384080,playstation 1 and maybe even the getaway from the  playstation 2. so are there any ps1 or ps2 games  
3D2V3mf1DcU,384080,388159,that you would definitely like to see added then  we have some remasters games like the last of us  
3D2V3mf1DcU,388160,392160,but that is included in the collection anyway  we've also got borderlands in here we've got  
3D2V3mf1DcU,392160,397520,mafia heavy rain and a few more i mean the total  remasters coming in at 49 games and then we have  
3D2V3mf1DcU,397520,402160,the playstation 3 games and this is by far the  largest catalogue of games in the entire lineup  
3D2V3mf1DcU,402160,407600,there are literally hundreds of games in here i  see batman cars god of war and a few lego games  
3D2V3mf1DcU,407600,413680,as well well in total i make the playstation 5  catalogue of games 135. that is quite a lot of  
3D2V3mf1DcU,413680,417120,games here for a classic catalogue but i guess  it depends if there are any games in here that  
3D2V3mf1DcU,417120,422160,you would actually like to play so in total if we  look at the entire library of classic games i make  
3D2V3mf1DcU,422160,427840,it 221 games again this is only included in the  premium plans you will not get this in the other  
3D2V3mf1DcU,427840,431840,two i think there are definitely some great games  in here but i would like to see more added over  
3D2V3mf1DcU,431840,436560,the coming months now another feature included  in the premium plan is the cloud streaming and  
3D2V3mf1DcU,436560,440480,this lets you stream hundreds of games without  the need to download them first there are a few  
3D2V3mf1DcU,440480,444720,ps4 games in here but most of them are ps3  games and that's because you actually don't  
3D2V3mf1DcU,444720,448880,download those anyway you can only stream them  all you need to do is browse through the library  
3D2V3mf1DcU,448880,452640,choose the game and just press stream depending  on the game it will only take you a minute or  
3D2V3mf1DcU,452640,456240,two to get ready and then that's it we're in and  we're playing the game without needing to wait  
3D2V3mf1DcU,456240,461199,for the download i've tested a few games over  the last 24 hours and quality looks okay i have  
3D2V3mf1DcU,461200,465360,noticed a few glitches as i'm playing but i'm not  sure if that's the game or the streaming service  
3D2V3mf1DcU,465360,469599,but this actually looks really good considering  i've not needed to download the entire game first  
3D2V3mf1DcU,469600,474400,let me try to stream another game quickly let's  try cars 2. i know my kids will love this and i'll  
3D2V3mf1DcU,474400,479199,tell you what for a classic ps2 game this plays  really well and again this is being streamed so  
3D2V3mf1DcU,479200,483600,first impressions on the cloud streaming for these  games well it works well i think the flexibility  
3D2V3mf1DcU,483600,487360,of being able to play some of the old classic  games without having to download them first is  
3D2V3mf1DcU,487360,491360,really useful the quality of the games won't be as  good as downloading them first i would imagine but  
3D2V3mf1DcU,491360,496080,for some games does it really matter another huge  advantage of cloud streaming is the fact that it  
3D2V3mf1DcU,496080,500319,won't take up any storage on the console it's not  a huge problem for me right now as i'm actually  
3D2V3mf1DcU,500320,505520,using a four terabyte ssd but for most once you've  downloaded what 10 or 15 games you've probably  
3D2V3mf1DcU,505520,509360,maxed it out oh and if you wondered what happens  to the games once you've streamed them well they  
3D2V3mf1DcU,509360,513360,do show up on your dashboard you can then choose  to remove from home which essentially deletes the  
3D2V3mf1DcU,513360,517039,game from the dashboard and they will also show  up in your game library collection so any of the  
3D2V3mf1DcU,517039,521279,games you've previously bought or downloaded they  will show up here but if you don't want those ps3  
3D2V3mf1DcU,521280,526480,or those streamed games to show here just hit the  menu icon and hit hide another feature included  
3D2V3mf1DcU,526480,531360,with the premium plan are the trials or the game  demos it's a bit strange that this is a benefit  
3D2V3mf1DcU,531360,536079,of a paid for plan but let's stick with it for a  second so if you wanted to try a game before you  
3D2V3mf1DcU,536080,540800,buy it well you can actually download and play a  time limited trial let's take farming simulator  
3D2V3mf1DcU,540800,544240,22. i know that's a game that you're probably all  looking forward to playing so this game will give  
3D2V3mf1DcU,544240,548880,us a three hour trial if we download it now  but each game comes with its own time limit  
3D2V3mf1DcU,548880,552880,so cyberpunk comes with five hours and that's  probably long enough to know whether it's right  
3D2V3mf1DcU,552880,557760,for you horizon has a five hour trial too and then  you've got biomutant which is probably the only  
3D2V3mf1DcU,557760,561920,game i actually want to try out but this one only  comes with a two hour trial at the moment there  
3D2V3mf1DcU,561920,566399,aren't that many trials to download in fact there  are only 15 right now we'll obviously see more and  
3D2V3mf1DcU,566400,571680,more added as new games come out but today is very  very limited i think these trials are a great idea  
3D2V3mf1DcU,571680,576080,i'm not disputing that at all but locking them  behind the premium tier is just really odd to  
3D2V3mf1DcU,576080,579840,me this should definitely be a feature that's  included in the essential tier no one's gonna  
3D2V3mf1DcU,579840,585360,buy the premium just to play these demos and  yeah you're right we've had some resistance  
3D2V3mf1DcU,585360,588880,okay so we've looked at all three tiers the  different games we get available and the different  
3D2V3mf1DcU,588880,593440,benefits but here are my final thoughts on which  one i think is the best to buy right now so first  
3D2V3mf1DcU,593440,598640,up if you've only ever used ps plus without the ps  now subscription you will automatically move on to  
3D2V3mf1DcU,598640,602240,the essential plan you will then see no difference  in the service that you've already used over the  
3D2V3mf1DcU,602240,606880,last few years it is a great entry level plan with  those ps plus collection games and those monthly  
3D2V3mf1DcU,606880,611920,games as well but if you want more from it and you  want to play some awesome ps4 and ps5 games like  
3D2V3mf1DcU,611920,616720,spider-man demon souls and other relatively  new games the extra plan is hard to pass on  
3D2V3mf1DcU,616720,621040,it's not a lot more than the essential plan  but you are getting hundreds of ps4 and ps5  
3D2V3mf1DcU,621040,625279,games and as i said before just download two  or three and it's pretty much paid for itself  
3D2V3mf1DcU,625280,629680,on paper the premium plan does have three extra  benefits but i'm going to ignore the game trials  
3D2V3mf1DcU,629680,633760,for now as i don't really see that as a selling  point so that leaves us with the classic games  
3D2V3mf1DcU,633760,640400,and the cloud streaming so the 200 or so ps1 ps2  and ps3 games are awesome and if there are a few  
3D2V3mf1DcU,640400,644400,classics in here that you definitely want to play  this is the only way to do it but if you scroll  
3D2V3mf1DcU,644400,647680,through the list and you've only seen a couple  of games you want to play you'll probably want to  
3D2V3mf1DcU,647680,651680,give it a miss for now and then there's the cloud  streaming which is an awesome feature that could  
3D2V3mf1DcU,651680,655600,save you time if you don't want to download the  games that are available this way for me and my  
3D2V3mf1DcU,655600,660079,slow internet speed this could be a huge advantage  for me and ultimately it comes down to just one  
3D2V3mf1DcU,660080,664160,thing are there enough games in the plan to  justify the price i'd look through the full  
3D2V3mf1DcU,664160,668959,list again and see what games you actually want to  play but for me if i wasn't automatically migrated  
3D2V3mf1DcU,668960,673040,onto the premium tier i would probably have just  opted for the extra plan i think that's the sweet  
3D2V3mf1DcU,673040,677519,spot right now until we see more classic games  and more trials added and what about you out of  
3D2V3mf1DcU,677520,681600,the three tiers we've got now the essential the  extra and the premium which one do you think is  
3D2V3mf1DcU,681600,685279,the best one or the one that you will go for  well i hope you enjoyed the video today and it  
3D2V3mf1DcU,685280,689520,was useful why don't you drop a ps plus in the  comments and i will give you a thumbs up for  
3D2V3mf1DcU,689520,693840,staying right to the end and if you did enjoy  today's video check out my ps5 console covers  
3D2V3mf1DcU,693840,698160,video next as it's where i unbox the three new  playstation 5 plates that we saw a couple of weeks  
3D2V3mf1DcU,698160,703519,ago thanks for watching please like sub and follow  me over on instagram and twitter until next time
