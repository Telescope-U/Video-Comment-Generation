wgSBtXNJjhs,6480,13120,At the age of 10 Yayoi Kusama had her first  hallucination which she described as flashes  
wgSBtXNJjhs,13120,20560,of light auras or dense fields of dots. The dots  would come to life and consume her and she would  
wgSBtXNJjhs,20560,27680,find herself obliterated. Polka dots have been  a lifelong obsession for her. For someone whose  
wgSBtXNJjhs,27680,33280,"work has crossed from art to fashion and from  filmmaking to performance art, her continuing  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,33280,40079,exploration of the polka dot has remained the one  consistent motif. So this is not a film about a  
wgSBtXNJjhs,40080,47280,specific artwork. This is a film about the simple  polka dot. A dot that has obsessed Kusama for  
wgSBtXNJjhs,47280,57840,"nine decades, from her struggle for recognition  to her later years as an art world sensation."
wgSBtXNJjhs,76560,83520,Yayoi Kusama was born in a rural provincial  town in Japan to a wealthy family. That same  
wgSBtXNJjhs,83520,89200,year the stock markets crashed and civil unrest  in Japan was followed by intense militarism.  
wgSBtXNJjhs,90000,96240,In 1941 Japan's entry into the war found  the 12-year old Kusama sewing military  
wgSBtXNJjhs,96240,102000,parachutes in textile factories. A skill she  would later utilize for her soft sculptures.  
wgSBtXNJjhs,102960,108560,Her mother was extremely abusive and had planned  an arranged marriage for Kusama and a life as an  
wgSBtXNJjhs,108560,114960,obedient housewife. In fact she did everything  in her power to stop Kusama becoming an artist...  
wgSBtXNJjhs,114960,119760,"or having any career at all, which she  said would bring shame on the family.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,119760,126160,"But art was Kusama's lifeline, it helped relieve  her hallucinations, depression and anxiety which  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,126160,133120,she still suffers from today. Kusama has described  how at times she feels her whole body functions  
wgSBtXNJjhs,133120,139440,"breaking down, with feelings of becoming ""absorbed by"" or ""dissolved"" within her surrounding environment. "
wgSBtXNJjhs,140400,147920,"Art is a way for her to take back control, a way to  fight her demons. Although she was starting to get  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,147920,154160,"some attention in Japan, it was a small art scene  then, and she was a woman living under a stifling  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,154160,161680,patriarchal society. Kusama needed to escape.  A chance discovery in a second-hand bookshop  
wgSBtXNJjhs,161680,167519,would change her life. American artist Georgia  O'Keeffe was one of the most famous artists in  
wgSBtXNJjhs,167520,173760,"the world, and her works were in every major museum  in the US, but she was pretty much unknown in Japan.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,174480,180879,Yet somehow - miraculously - a book of her paintings  found its way into the young Kusama's hands in  
wgSBtXNJjhs,180880,187040,rural Japan. It was a revelation! Kusama  was stunned by O'Keeffe's paintings  
wgSBtXNJjhs,187040,193360,"and would explore similar themes later, but she  was also attracted to her achievements as a woman.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,194160,200720,Kusama wrote to her in the US and sent her some  drawings. In an incredible show of generosity  
wgSBtXNJjhs,200720,206400,O'Keefe not only took the time to write back but  then sent letters of introduction to important  
wgSBtXNJjhs,206400,214799,"people in the New York art world. In July 1956  Kusama destroyed 2,000 old work she had created.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,216160,225840,America would be a new beginning for the artist  and she wouldn't return to japan until 1973.
wgSBtXNJjhs,227760,231120,"Kusama arrived in New York with  a suitcase full of drawings,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,231120,237120,"a determination to grab everything going in  the city, and (in her own words) to become a star.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,238000,242480,The first thing she did was go up to the top  of the Empire State building and look down  
wgSBtXNJjhs,242480,248239,at the city she planned to conquer. We mustn't  underestimate what a difficult task it was for  
wgSBtXNJjhs,248240,254160,"a young Japanese woman with no support, speaking  little to no English to up sticks and moved to  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,254160,262240,New York from a small Japanese town - in the  1950s! This required monumental determination.  
wgSBtXNJjhs,262960,268639,She went from a wealthy life in Japan to living  in abject poverty in New York surviving on a  
wgSBtXNJjhs,268640,275760,"diet of potatoes, onions, and black coffee. No  wonder she often describes how she craved fame.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,275760,281840,It is something artists rarely discuss but  for Kusama it would be her driving force.
wgSBtXNJjhs,286320,291840,The field of dots she experienced in her  hallucinations developed into a visual device - the  
wgSBtXNJjhs,291840,298960,"polka dot. This image of her mother, by ten-year-old  Kusama was the first time she would use the dot, "
wgSBtXNJjhs,298960,304560,"and it would become her ""trademark"". We could  make a comparison with Roy Liechtenstein  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,304560,312639,"who was also using dots or Bridget Riley, who was  exploring Op-Art, but for Kusama, dots came directly  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,312640,319360,"from within. For her, dots were a form of healing,  and repetition of them was a way to calm her mind,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,319360,325680,"and overcome her fear and anxiety. They  were (as she said) a way to ""self-obliterate"",  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,326320,334480,"a way to disappear into her artwork. In New York,  Kusama began applying the polka dot to animals,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,334480,341280,"paper, canvas, walls and naked bodies. From the  beginning, Kusama played with her persona. "
wgSBtXNJjhs,341280,347840,"She was a self-styled ""outsider"" in America, a female  artist in an aggressively male dominated scene,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,348480,355440,"a Japanese person in the overwhelmingly white  art scene, and a victim of neurosis and depression. "
wgSBtXNJjhs,356560,362639,"She refused to be categorized or put in a box,  continuously innovating and reinventing herself.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,363440,369840,"As a critic once said: ""Miss Kusama is an  artist who fits in everywhere but stands alone"""
wgSBtXNJjhs,374160,379680,New York at the time was under the spell of  Abstract Expressionism but Kusama's first show  
wgSBtXNJjhs,379680,386560,"in New York consisted of what she called ""Infinity  net paintings"", starting the obsessive repetitive  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,386560,393440,work that would define her career. Kusama rejected  the broad dramatic marks of Abstract Expressionism  
wgSBtXNJjhs,393440,400400,and painted thousands of tiny semi-circles of  paint repeated across huge canvases. Invisible  
wgSBtXNJjhs,400400,406320,"when seen at a distance, but up close form an  undulating net with no beginning, middle or  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,406320,413520,"end. Her work was calm and collected, in contrast  to the emotional mark making of Jackson Pollock.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,415120,418400,"The dots and ""nets"" could be  traced back to her early work,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,418400,423040,"but here they were huge - a physical  embodiment of ""self-obliteration"".  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,423920,429600,"Her work was so groundbreaking, it anticipated  the emerging Minimalist movement, and we can see  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,429600,436640,it as a bridge between Abstract Expressionism  and Minimalism. It was a great start for Kusama.  
wgSBtXNJjhs,436640,443633,"Less than a year in the city, and her first solo  show in 1959 created an immediate buzz. "
wgSBtXNJjhs,444000,450480,"Kusama, always a workaholic spent every waking hour  making net paintings, sometimes working through  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,450480,457120,"the night, more and more of them, until her  studio was full. Not surprisingly, she suffered  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,457120,463840,"extreme hallucinations, and was rushed to Bellevue  hospital for her obsessive compulsive neurosis."
wgSBtXNJjhs,466320,471680,Installation is a term used to describe art  that is often designed for a specific place  
wgSBtXNJjhs,471680,477840,"or for a temporary period of time, and Kusama  would become a leading exponent of this art form. "
wgSBtXNJjhs,478560,485760,"In 1962, she began making soft sculpture phalluses  out of cotton stuffed canvas. This was radical work  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,485760,492240,"for a female artist, and these sculptures made over  60 years ago still have the power to shock today,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,492800,499280,"because of the juxtaposition of humor and  sexuality. Her first ""official"" installation was  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,499280,506560,"in 1963. A rowboat which she covered in her soft  phallic shapes, presented in a space where the  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,506560,512960,"walls were covered in wallpaper reproductions  of the same sculpture. It was totally unique,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,512960,518159,and no one had seen anything like it in  New York. Phalluses would become another  
wgSBtXNJjhs,518159,523839,"theme of Kusama who said that as a child she  was forced by her mother to spy on her father,"
wgSBtXNJjhs,524400,529200,"when she caught him making love to his  mistress, it caused a lifelong aversion to sex"
wgSBtXNJjhs,532640,538640,One thing the art world rarely discusses is  plagiarism between artists. That is unless  
wgSBtXNJjhs,538640,545280,"you are Yayoi Kusama, who in an unusual move,  specifically addressed how her work was ""co-opted""  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,545280,549200,"by male artists, who then showed  it in more established galleries.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,550160,555680,"Kusama would later say, it wasn't the idea of  being ripped off that bothered her but rather  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,555680,561839,"the lack of acknowledgement. Claes Oldenburg  was working with hard materials in the 1960s,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,562640,568720,"but just months after Kusama's exhibition of  soft sculptural works, he put on a show filled  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,568720,575439,with soft sculptures. It launched Oldenburg's  international career. Kusama's innovation in the  
wgSBtXNJjhs,575440,582080,"art form received little recognition. Then there  was Andy Warhol, a close friend of Kusama - or so  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,582080,588800,"she thought. In an interview she said: ""Andy Warhol  came to the show and admired my wallpaper images.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,589360,597839,"He said ""Wow. fantastic Yayoi, I like this so much""  and then in 1966 he went on to cover the walls of  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,597840,604720,"the Leo Castelli gallery with wallpaper. She sank  into a depression and retreated to her studio,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,604720,609839,covering all her windows so nobody could  steal her ideas - and worked in secret.
wgSBtXNJjhs,613120,620320,"Then in 1965, kusama re-emerged with her first  ""Infinity room"", called ""Phalli's field"" in which  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,620320,624960,she arranged hundreds of polka dotted  soft phallic forms in a mirrored room.  
wgSBtXNJjhs,626400,633040,"Artists have always worked with perspective and  infinity, but Kusama's work was one of the earliest  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,633040,638800,installation artworks that encouraged viewers  to enter and experience rather than passively  
wgSBtXNJjhs,638800,645839,view a picture in a frame. The room enveloped the  viewer and no longer is the viewer in control.  
wgSBtXNJjhs,646400,652000,"All artists to some extent control how we view  their work, but for Kusama, a lack of control of  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,652000,658720,"her health, meant she created work that controls  EXACTLY how we the viewer perceive time and space.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,659440,663440,"Then just seven months after  her infinity room failed to sell,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,663440,669360,the artist Lucas Samaras showed a similar mirrored  environment at the established Pace gallery.  
wgSBtXNJjhs,669360,676160,"He got rave reviews - and a sellout show. This  was Samara's first environment, and there is no  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,676160,682959,mistaking its similarity to Kusama's mirrored room  that preceded it. These mirror infinity rooms are  
wgSBtXNJjhs,682960,689680,"arguably her most popular works, and when we think  of mirrored rooms today we only think of Kusama.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,690800,696720,"But after seeing Samara's room, Kusama became  so deeply depressed that she attempted suicide."
wgSBtXNJjhs,700000,706640,"In 1966, Kusama participated in the 33rd  venice biennale, the most prestigious arts  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,706640,712960,"festival in the world - the only problem was  that she hadn't been asked by the organisers,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,712960,718000,"she just gate-crashed the event! Without  permission she showed ""Narcissus garden"",  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,718000,723280,"a witty take on the commercialisation of the  art world, consisting of hundreds of mirrored  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,723280,730160,"spheres - what she called a ""kinetic carpet"". Then  dressed in a gold kimono she proceeded to sell  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,730160,736560,"each sphere for two dollars, until the biennale  committee threw her out. There were many artists  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,736560,743120,who were aggressive self-promoters but none  of them were women. Kusama had to really fight  
wgSBtXNJjhs,743120,748080,"just for her voice to be heard, and some people  didn't like that. They criticised what they  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,748080,754000,"called ""her excessive self-promotion and lust  for publicity"", but as Kusama saw it, she was  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,754000,760240,"a ""living work of art"". Her work is deeply personal  and so she places herself central to that work."
wgSBtXNJjhs,763360,769600,"Kusama had been a pioneer in minimalism, sculpture  and installation art, and now she turned to  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,769600,775600,"performance art. Some of Kusama's earliest  surviving paintings relate to the horrors of war,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,776160,783199,and she had a strong political conscience. In  1967 she began organising anti-war protests  
wgSBtXNJjhs,783200,789600,"and happenings known as ""Atomic Explosions"". She  painted her friends nude bodies with polka dots  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,789600,794639,"and demonstrated on wall street, demanding the  government bring back the troops from Vietnam.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,795440,800080,"For all her zany public persona, Kusama  was completely serious about her  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,800080,805360,"work, and as with much of her art, what on the  surface seemed almost silly and lightweight,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,805360,810160,made a powerful statement. Kusama  was well placed to criticise war.
wgSBtXNJjhs,812320,817440,"Her youth had been marked by the effects of the  Atomic bomb, and she was viscerally opposed to war.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,818640,825520,She protested the only way she knew -through  art - the work brought her more notoriety but  
wgSBtXNJjhs,825520,832800,"few financial benefits. In another revolutionary  performance of 1968, Kusama even officiated at  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,832800,839600,"the first ""gay wedding"" having formed her own church:  ""The church of self-obliteration"". Her performances  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,839600,845759,"hit the news in Japan and caused a scandal,  bringing shame on her deeply conservative family."
wgSBtXNJjhs,849280,855840,"In 1973, Kusama returned to Japan where  she was virtually unknown and dismissed.  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,856960,863440,"Then in 1977, after a lifetime of fighting anxiety  and hallucinations, she checked herself into a  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,863440,870000,"psychiatric hospital in Tokyo, and has lived  there ever since. Kusama has been open about  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,870000,874880,her mental health and remains on medication  to prevent depression and suicidal thoughts.  
wgSBtXNJjhs,875520,882720,Every single day she commutes to her studio and  works obsessively on her paintings from 9am to 6pm.  
wgSBtXNJjhs,883760,889760,"In 1989, Kusama reached 60 years old, an  important birthday in Japanese culture,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,889760,894240,that symbolises a new start.  And it certainly was for Kusama!  
wgSBtXNJjhs,895120,901040,"Although she had a cult following, she was pretty  much forgotten about by the art world, until  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,901040,908160,"1989, unexpectedly The Centre for International  Contemporary Arts in New York asked to stage a  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,908160,915519,retrospective of her art. It would relaunch her  career - both internationally and in Japan. Then  
wgSBtXNJjhs,915520,925840,in 1993 she returned to the Venice Biennale. This  time she was invited as a representative of Japan.
wgSBtXNJjhs,927360,933360,Kusama has finally achieved a worldwide success  that had eluded her for so long. fuelled in some  
wgSBtXNJjhs,933360,939760,part by social media. People queue up for hours  for just 60 seconds in one of her Infinity room  
wgSBtXNJjhs,939760,946720,"installations. Each image they take of infinity,  join millions more on the internet - itself  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,947360,956800,"infinite. Today in her 90s, Kusama is as productive  as ever. Often dismissed as ""quirky"" or ""populist"", she  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,956800,962480,"is in fact, one of the most radical female artists  of all time, who made some of the most important  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,962480,970079,artworks of the 1960s. An innovator and a rule  breaker. Many artists have famously struggled  
wgSBtXNJjhs,970080,976240,"with their mental health, and like them it is  impossible to separate the art of Yayoi Kusama  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,976240,982560,"from her mental health, but why should we? Artists  like Kusama, make us question our understanding  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,982560,989200,"of mental illness, and see it not as an ""obstacle"",  but as just another part of the human condition."
wgSBtXNJjhs,991760,998160,"These infinite repetitive works were originally  designed to eliminate Kusama's intrusive thoughts,  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,998960,1003200,"but now, as viewers, we can experience a small part  "
wgSBtXNJjhs,1003200,1009840,"of her thoughts and feelings in the  physical endlessness of ""Kusama's world""."
