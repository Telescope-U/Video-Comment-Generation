7n0eDNz_jTU,0,1680,hey guys it's carl welcome back to
7n0eDNz_jTU,1680,3280,another episode and one of the first
7n0eDNz_jTU,3280,6319,budget ones in 2022 so i know that we
7n0eDNz_jTU,6319,8080,have a ton of different products to look
7n0eDNz_jTU,8080,10240,at today and you'd be surprised how
7n0eDNz_jTU,10240,12240,difficult it is to find tech around that
7n0eDNz_jTU,12240,14880,20 to 25 mark but we've got a full
7n0eDNz_jTU,14880,16720,episode today and as always i try to
7n0eDNz_jTU,16720,18240,hook you guys up so make sure you're sub
7n0eDNz_jTU,18240,19760,to the channel that's the first thing
7n0eDNz_jTU,19760,21680,and of course leave one comment down
7n0eDNz_jTU,21680,23920,below don't spam the feed and also don't
7n0eDNz_jTU,23920,26240,fall for spammers in the chat pretending
7n0eDNz_jTU,26240,28000,to be me pretending to give away
7n0eDNz_jTU,28000,30080,something i will contact you on either
7n0eDNz_jTU,30080,31679,instagram twitter leave your handles
7n0eDNz_jTU,31679,33200,there and i will give away a couple of
7n0eDNz_jTU,33200,34640,these products that we see because we've
7n0eDNz_jTU,34640,36480,got a ton of them we've also divided the
7n0eDNz_jTU,36480,38640,episode into i believe five different
7n0eDNz_jTU,38640,40559,segments so we've got accessories we've
7n0eDNz_jTU,40559,42879,got dongles we've got gaming we've got
7n0eDNz_jTU,42879,44960,lifestyle and we have
7n0eDNz_jTU,44960,46719,travel
7n0eDNz_jTU,46719,47760,travel
7n0eDNz_jTU,47760,49440,so let's get into it with some
7n0eDNz_jTU,49440,51680,accessories first all this tech remember
7n0eDNz_jTU,51680,54559,around that 20 to 25 mark all linked
7n0eDNz_jTU,54559,56559,down below so the first thing to look at
7n0eDNz_jTU,56559,58320,mostly because phones these days don't
7n0eDNz_jTU,58320,60320,come with any chargers you typically
7n0eDNz_jTU,60320,62239,have to buy your own i'd recommend
7n0eDNz_jTU,62239,64400,getting larger power wattage ones so
7n0eDNz_jTU,64400,67680,this one for example is from aki this is
7n0eDNz_jTU,67680,70080,a 65 watt charger so it'll juice up your
7n0eDNz_jTU,70080,72000,phone of course faster than using just
7n0eDNz_jTU,72000,74080,the standard usb-c cable plugging it
7n0eDNz_jTU,74080,76240,into a computer or smaller brick i would
7n0eDNz_jTU,76240,78240,definitely recommend picking one up with
7n0eDNz_jTU,78240,79759,multiple charging ports so you can
7n0eDNz_jTU,79759,81520,charge obviously multiple devices
7n0eDNz_jTU,81520,83200,everything has pretty much made the
7n0eDNz_jTU,83200,85840,switch to usbc these days so having two
7n0eDNz_jTU,85840,87280,different options you can charge your
7n0eDNz_jTU,87280,91119,phone and say your laptop even your
7n0eDNz_jTU,91119,94640,tablet your smart watch with one single
7n0eDNz_jTU,94640,96640,charger so great to obviously travel
7n0eDNz_jTU,96640,99280,with and great to keep at home as well
7n0eDNz_jTU,99280,101280,second off if you are more of the
7n0eDNz_jTU,101280,103360,wireless charger kind of person you have
7n0eDNz_jTU,103360,105600,different sort of wireless qi charging
7n0eDNz_jTU,105600,107520,pucks so i just unwrapped one from
7n0eDNz_jTU,107520,109520,jaybird we've got a really cheap one
7n0eDNz_jTU,109520,112159,from phone salesman i've had this actual
7n0eDNz_jTU,112159,114479,brick charging puck for close to five to
7n0eDNz_jTU,114479,116799,six years so it survived it's still
7n0eDNz_jTU,116799,119200,around that 20 25 mark you can see how
7n0eDNz_jTU,119200,121119,dated it is actually because it still
7n0eDNz_jTU,121119,123520,has micro usbc and we've just got this
7n0eDNz_jTU,123520,125200,new one from movi so all of these
7n0eDNz_jTU,125200,128319,options i believe this one is slightly
7n0eDNz_jTU,128319,129679,over 25
7n0eDNz_jTU,129679,131520,but if you want something to charge
7n0eDNz_jTU,131520,133200,wirelessly obviously these are great
7n0eDNz_jTU,133200,134560,because they can live on your desk you
7n0eDNz_jTU,134560,136720,can just plop down your phone and then
7n0eDNz_jTU,136720,138080,your phone will charge while you
7n0eDNz_jTU,138080,140800,continue your work if you are on team
7n0eDNz_jTU,140800,142959,apple though we do have mag safe
7n0eDNz_jTU,142959,144560,chargers of course i've got two
7n0eDNz_jTU,144560,146000,different options here and at first
7n0eDNz_jTU,146000,148879,glance these look identical but this is
7n0eDNz_jTU,148879,150480,actually the og magsafe charger
7n0eDNz_jTU,150480,152239,obviously apple charges way more for
7n0eDNz_jTU,152239,154400,this but i have put a little dbrand skin
7n0eDNz_jTU,154400,156720,on top and brand in its own is its own
7n0eDNz_jTU,156720,158400,little self plug if you guys don't know
7n0eDNz_jTU,158400,160080,them yet they're a skin company they
7n0eDNz_jTU,160080,162000,make skins for pretty much every single
7n0eDNz_jTU,162000,163920,device all the way from phones all the
7n0eDNz_jTU,163920,166400,way to magsafe chargers themselves and
7n0eDNz_jTU,166400,168720,they actually just released dark plates
7n0eDNz_jTU,168720,171200,i'm to kind of plug that as well over 20
7n0eDNz_jTU,171200,173200,but if you have a playstation 5. these
7n0eDNz_jTU,173200,174640,are actually kind of listed as their
7n0eDNz_jTU,174640,177519,dark plates 2.0 because playstation
7n0eDNz_jTU,177519,178959,actually sent them a little cease and
7n0eDNz_jTU,178959,180879,desist because their original dark
7n0eDNz_jTU,180879,182640,plates looked a bit too similar to the
7n0eDNz_jTU,182640,184400,og playstation plates they had to put
7n0eDNz_jTU,184400,186400,this little event on the side and as a
7n0eDNz_jTU,186400,188239,little meme i guess drain is kind of
7n0eDNz_jTU,188239,189599,known for that if we can get a close
7n0eDNz_jTU,189599,191920,macro shot they actually have the cease
7n0eDNz_jTU,191920,195040,and desist in morse code along the
7n0eDNz_jTU,195040,196800,inside panel so i think that's super
7n0eDNz_jTU,196800,199599,cool dbrand obviously makes skins for
7n0eDNz_jTU,199599,201360,everything and of course dark plates
7n0eDNz_jTU,201360,202800,just a bunch of accessories that the
7n0eDNz_jTU,202800,204319,robots like to make so if you want to
7n0eDNz_jTU,204319,206640,customize your own device definitely
7n0eDNz_jTU,206640,208799,under that 20 25 mark they've made an
7n0eDNz_jTU,208799,210400,appearance on the channel for also five
7n0eDNz_jTU,210400,213120,to six years definitely hit them up but
7n0eDNz_jTU,213120,215360,back to the magsafe chargers this one 20
7n0eDNz_jTU,215360,218480,off of amazon it is similar but it isn't
7n0eDNz_jTU,218480,220319,made out of metal you can actually hear
7n0eDNz_jTU,220319,222480,it
7n0eDNz_jTU,224720,226480,this one is just made out of plastic and
7n0eDNz_jTU,226480,229360,in comparison it doesn't have as strong
7n0eDNz_jTU,229360,231599,of a magnet but still strong enough to
7n0eDNz_jTU,231599,233599,charge your phone and i would say if you
7n0eDNz_jTU,233599,236080,rock say a magsafe case
7n0eDNz_jTU,236080,238159,that's when the magnets or that's when
7n0eDNz_jTU,238159,239920,the strength really kind of diminishes
7n0eDNz_jTU,239920,242319,so if you do rock your phone naked or if
7n0eDNz_jTU,242319,243519,you aren't really moving your phone
7n0eDNz_jTU,243519,245760,around that much i would say you can get
7n0eDNz_jTU,245760,247599,by and it's just great to have by the
7n0eDNz_jTU,247599,249519,couch as an extra little mag safe
7n0eDNz_jTU,249519,250959,accessory because you can technically
7n0eDNz_jTU,250959,253200,buy two of these for the price of what
7n0eDNz_jTU,253200,256160,apple charges for one continuing on with
7n0eDNz_jTU,256160,258479,magsafe accessories and once again at
7n0eDNz_jTU,258479,260880,first glance you probably won't see the
7n0eDNz_jTU,260880,263280,difference besides of course the little
7n0eDNz_jTU,263280,265120,apple logo and of course the ones with
7n0eDNz_jTU,265120,268080,that are the og apple certified magsafe
7n0eDNz_jTU,268080,270000,wallets these leather ones cost around
7n0eDNz_jTU,270000,271840,45 to 50
7n0eDNz_jTU,271840,273520,if you want to keep things on budget
7n0eDNz_jTU,273520,275360,once again this light purple one it just
7n0eDNz_jTU,275360,278240,doesn't have the logo it does the exact
7n0eDNz_jTU,278240,280240,same thing it holds your cards and it
7n0eDNz_jTU,280240,282560,slaps on to the back of your iphone and
7n0eDNz_jTU,282560,284560,once again the only real difference the
7n0eDNz_jTU,284560,287360,magnet isn't as strong but it's strong
7n0eDNz_jTU,287360,289520,enough you can see i can shake my phone
7n0eDNz_jTU,289520,291280,around and that
7n0eDNz_jTU,291280,292320,wallet
7n0eDNz_jTU,292320,295120,is not coming off the back so once again
7n0eDNz_jTU,295120,296960,if you want to save some money
7n0eDNz_jTU,296960,297840,20
7n0eDNz_jTU,297840,300880,versus 45 if you don't care about having
7n0eDNz_jTU,300880,302720,an apple logo i would say that the
7n0eDNz_jTU,302720,305120,leather is more supple i would say this
7n0eDNz_jTU,305120,307199,is almost a faux leather but i guess
7n0eDNz_jTU,307199,308320,you're actually being a bit more
7n0eDNz_jTU,308320,309759,environmentally friendly because we're
7n0eDNz_jTU,309759,312639,not using real stuff and editor nick
7n0eDNz_jTU,312639,314320,this is actually his little magsafe
7n0eDNz_jTU,314320,316560,wallet you can see the nice patina on it
7n0eDNz_jTU,316560,318639,and i won't comment on how gunky and
7n0eDNz_jTU,318639,320960,dirty it is
7n0eDNz_jTU,320960,324000,i use it every day
7n0eDNz_jTU,324000,327120,that choice is up to you
7n0eDNz_jTU,327680,329440,the last little accessory keeping it in
7n0eDNz_jTU,329440,330960,the apple game it's surprising that you
7n0eDNz_jTU,330960,332560,can actually still find some things from
7n0eDNz_jTU,332560,334639,the apple website under 20
7n0eDNz_jTU,334639,336560,they are of course the apple watch
7n0eDNz_jTU,336560,338960,straps you can swap these out for so
7n0eDNz_jTU,338960,340960,many different color options apple
7n0eDNz_jTU,340960,342800,always updates them i believe they just
7n0eDNz_jTU,342800,344639,came out with a
7n0eDNz_jTU,344639,346960,is it a black history month or a black
7n0eDNz_jTU,346960,348560,pride month i thought it looked pretty
7n0eDNz_jTU,348560,350800,fresh it was like green and black i
7n0eDNz_jTU,350800,352240,think i might have to place an order for
7n0eDNz_jTU,352240,353759,that they also have the traditional
7n0eDNz_jTU,353759,355360,rubber straps which i'm the biggest fan
7n0eDNz_jTU,355360,356960,of because i tend to work out with my
7n0eDNz_jTU,356960,358720,apple watch they wick away sweat you
7n0eDNz_jTU,358720,360319,don't have to worry about them and if
7n0eDNz_jTU,360319,362240,you want you can also go for a little
7n0eDNz_jTU,362240,365520,two-tone finish so i've got my og nike
7n0eDNz_jTU,365520,368319,apple strap and if you want to be funky
7n0eDNz_jTU,368319,371440,you can rock a watch like that so really
7n0eDNz_jTU,371440,374080,options are endless watch strap options
7n0eDNz_jTU,374080,375440,are pretty much endless in terms of
7n0eDNz_jTU,375440,377360,colors so if you come up with a unique
7n0eDNz_jTU,377360,380080,one i'm still trying to find the perfect
7n0eDNz_jTU,380080,382000,orange strap and i know that apple kind
7n0eDNz_jTU,382000,384720,of releases papaya they also have
7n0eDNz_jTU,384720,387680,kumquat as a color but it's not
7n0eDNz_jTU,387680,390240,true orange
7n0eDNz_jTU,390240,392319,waiting for an apple next off on the
7n0eDNz_jTU,392319,394800,list is that dongle space and this is
7n0eDNz_jTU,394800,396960,really an area that is around that 10 to
7n0eDNz_jTU,396960,398800,15 mark depending on where you get them
7n0eDNz_jTU,398800,400720,from i'll go through these super quickly
7n0eDNz_jTU,400720,403360,so the first one is just an hdmi capture
7n0eDNz_jTU,403360,405759,card if any of you are streaming if any
7n0eDNz_jTU,405759,408479,of you want to record content say on
7n0eDNz_jTU,408479,411919,your pc even on your mac to go on twitch
7n0eDNz_jTU,411919,413440,this is a great little device if you
7n0eDNz_jTU,413440,416240,have a external camera like kind of the
7n0eDNz_jTU,416240,417759,ones i'm recording with right now my
7n0eDNz_jTU,417759,419840,sony's i can use that as a dedicated
7n0eDNz_jTU,419840,423280,webcam you just need an hdmi cable plug
7n0eDNz_jTU,423280,425199,that into this the other end goes into
7n0eDNz_jTU,425199,427280,the camera and then you can now use your
7n0eDNz_jTU,427280,429759,camera as a webcam to stream so a lot
7n0eDNz_jTU,429759,432000,better quality than your built-in webcam
7n0eDNz_jTU,432000,433680,dongle life for those of you that still
7n0eDNz_jTU,433680,435599,live it and even though i have upgraded
7n0eDNz_jTU,435599,438160,to my 16-inch macbook pro my sd card
7n0eDNz_jTU,438160,440639,slot is kind of not working half the
7n0eDNz_jTU,440639,442720,time i find that i still need to live
7n0eDNz_jTU,442720,444479,the dongle life sadly and i know that
7n0eDNz_jTU,444479,446479,other content creators have kind of said
7n0eDNz_jTU,446479,448319,the same thing if you want access to
7n0eDNz_jTU,448319,450880,traditional ports like usba i know usb
7n0eDNz_jTU,450880,452880,sticks are still a thing of course sd
7n0eDNz_jTU,452880,455599,card slot microsd or even just an extra
7n0eDNz_jTU,455599,458000,usbc slot or if you just want to leave a
7n0eDNz_jTU,458000,460560,small dongle life smaller sometimes
7n0eDNz_jTU,460560,462080,better we've got a couple different
7n0eDNz_jTU,462080,464479,options say techie and of course anchor
7n0eDNz_jTU,464479,466160,and the last little item i just had to
7n0eDNz_jTU,466160,468319,include this quickly i did run into an
7n0eDNz_jTU,468319,470160,issue at ces where i had to use an
7n0eDNz_jTU,470160,471840,external microphone i was actually using
7n0eDNz_jTU,471840,474000,my pixel as that doesn't have a
7n0eDNz_jTU,474000,476479,headphone slot i just had to use this
7n0eDNz_jTU,476479,479120,little dongle around five maybe 10 bucks
7n0eDNz_jTU,479120,481759,with shipping it just plugs into a usb c
7n0eDNz_jTU,481759,483919,port and then i could plug my microphone
7n0eDNz_jTU,483919,485520,or i guess if you still use a
7n0eDNz_jTU,485520,487280,traditional pair of headphones with a
7n0eDNz_jTU,487280,488560,three and a half millimeter headphone
7n0eDNz_jTU,488560,489520,jack
7n0eDNz_jTU,489520,492319,this guy is your saving grace the next
7n0eDNz_jTU,492319,494400,section we're gonna switch into travel
7n0eDNz_jTU,494400,496000,because i think i guess depending on
7n0eDNz_jTU,496000,498879,where you live travel is slowly becoming
7n0eDNz_jTU,498879,500560,somewhat of a norm again i just went to
7n0eDNz_jTU,500560,503520,ces thankfully didn't catch covet out in
7n0eDNz_jTU,503520,505520,vegas but i did travel with this little
7n0eDNz_jTU,505520,508000,amazon basics pack so once again amazon
7n0eDNz_jTU,508000,510160,basics some of the cheaper things around
7n0eDNz_jTU,510160,511680,20 25
7n0eDNz_jTU,511680,514159,it's just simply a pack that can hold
7n0eDNz_jTU,514159,516000,all of your accessories so we've got a
7n0eDNz_jTU,516000,518080,bunch of different cables out here i
7n0eDNz_jTU,518080,520080,might even include these as well you can
7n0eDNz_jTU,520080,522000,never have enough cables to charge your
7n0eDNz_jTU,522000,524720,devices so i've just got standard usbc
7n0eDNz_jTU,524720,527040,nice braided cable we've got a little
7n0eDNz_jTU,527040,528720,compartment for batteries and i actually
7n0eDNz_jTU,528720,530720,swap these out with my microphone that i
7n0eDNz_jTU,530720,532880,use so yeah the possibilities are kind
7n0eDNz_jTU,532880,535519,of endless it's just nice to have all of
7n0eDNz_jTU,535519,537279,your accessories packed into one place
7n0eDNz_jTU,537279,539040,instead of all this kind of free
7n0eDNz_jTU,539040,540880,floating at the bottom of your bag it
7n0eDNz_jTU,540880,542959,keeps things organized it keeps things a
7n0eDNz_jTU,542959,546240,bit tidy because in the end being tidy
7n0eDNz_jTU,546240,548399,and organized is usually the way to go i
7n0eDNz_jTU,548399,550320,could learn a bit more on that i
7n0eDNz_jTU,550320,552160,struggle with it that's why we've got
7n0eDNz_jTU,552160,554080,things like this that exist
7n0eDNz_jTU,554080,556000,next off still related to travel just
7n0eDNz_jTU,556000,558080,because uh i did happen to travel with
7n0eDNz_jTU,558080,560160,these because i do lose all of my stuff
7n0eDNz_jTU,560160,561920,all the time these are just simply
7n0eDNz_jTU,561920,564160,location finders so if you are on team
7n0eDNz_jTU,564160,566000,apple you've got of course apple air
7n0eDNz_jTU,566000,567440,tags great little additions that you can
7n0eDNz_jTU,567440,569360,stick on keys i actually have one on my
7n0eDNz_jTU,569360,571680,carry-on suitcase or if you're in the
7n0eDNz_jTU,571680,573839,android space you've got the samsung
7n0eDNz_jTU,573839,576160,galaxy tags they essentially all work
7n0eDNz_jTU,576160,577760,exactly the same stick them on things
7n0eDNz_jTU,577760,579360,that you tend to lose and then you can
7n0eDNz_jTU,579360,581120,find them in your corresponding app so
7n0eDNz_jTU,581120,584240,really helpful if you are forgetful
7n0eDNz_jTU,584240,586399,like i am lost little pieces are just
7n0eDNz_jTU,586399,588320,smart plugs so depending on where you go
7n0eDNz_jTU,588320,590160,if you are say traveling within north
7n0eDNz_jTU,590160,592160,america just having a little smart plug
7n0eDNz_jTU,592160,594240,if you have smart accessories if you are
7n0eDNz_jTU,594240,595600,going somewhere
7n0eDNz_jTU,595600,597839,outside of north america like i'm going
7n0eDNz_jTU,597839,600160,actually for mwc to europe just get a
7n0eDNz_jTU,600160,601920,little adapter that lets you use
7n0eDNz_jTU,601920,603680,different sorts of plugs this one from
7n0eDNz_jTU,603680,605200,insignia gets you pretty much around the
7n0eDNz_jTU,605200,606560,world it's got a nice little connector
7n0eDNz_jTU,606560,608720,for europe you've got ones from the uk
7n0eDNz_jTU,608720,611600,australia which i haven't been to and
7n0eDNz_jTU,611600,613600,yeah you can kind of mix and match all
7n0eDNz_jTU,613600,615440,of them so really handy if you are a
7n0eDNz_jTU,615440,617360,world traveler and this one we kind of
7n0eDNz_jTU,617360,619200,included just because it gives you
7n0eDNz_jTU,619200,621760,access to two charging ports or i guess
7n0eDNz_jTU,621760,625040,two normal voltage ports and two classic
7n0eDNz_jTU,625040,627120,usb a ports so i'll just kind of include
7n0eDNz_jTU,627120,629519,these all together just really handy to
7n0eDNz_jTU,629519,632320,have in your travel pack okay moving on
7n0eDNz_jTU,632320,634240,to the gaming section and we've got a
7n0eDNz_jTU,634240,635440,bunch of different things and i'd
7n0eDNz_jTU,635440,637600,actually kind of say some of this is a
7n0eDNz_jTU,637600,639839,desk accessory related as well so for
7n0eDNz_jTU,639839,641200,gaming we've got these cool little
7n0eDNz_jTU,641200,643120,controller stands i wish you could pick
7n0eDNz_jTU,643120,645200,up a controller for 20 that is not the
7n0eDNz_jTU,645200,647519,case so this one is just for an xbox
7n0eDNz_jTU,647519,649600,controller this is around ten dollars if
7n0eDNz_jTU,649600,650959,you'd like to show off your different
7n0eDNz_jTU,650959,653440,controllers if you are a custom
7n0eDNz_jTU,653440,655760,controller collector so this one here is
7n0eDNz_jTU,655760,658480,actually my prized possession of xbox
7n0eDNz_jTU,658480,660000,controllers it actually doesn't even
7n0eDNz_jTU,660000,661920,work anymore because i mash the control
7n0eDNz_jTU,661920,663920,sticks too much but i picked this up at
7n0eDNz_jTU,663920,666079,my very first e3 they were making them
7n0eDNz_jTU,666079,667680,on site so you can see
7n0eDNz_jTU,667680,669920,64 out of a thousand if we get a little
7n0eDNz_jTU,669920,671320,zoom in
7n0eDNz_jTU,671320,674560,2017 like i said first e3 and they just
7n0eDNz_jTU,674560,677040,happen to have one with some orange
7n0eDNz_jTU,677040,679279,bumpers i love this thing so i can
7n0eDNz_jTU,679279,681360,actually show this off on its own little
7n0eDNz_jTU,681360,683760,pedestal we've got some other controller
7n0eDNz_jTU,683760,685519,stands as well this is a cool one if
7n0eDNz_jTU,685519,686720,you're feeling the dark side we've got a
7n0eDNz_jTU,686720,688640,little stormtrooper so he's holding a
7n0eDNz_jTU,688640,691120,playstation 5 controller and kind of off
7n0eDNz_jTU,691120,692800,to the side we've got
7n0eDNz_jTU,692800,693839,obviously
7n0eDNz_jTU,693839,695519,desk accessories but some of them are
7n0eDNz_jTU,695519,697440,actually useful so if you are into
7n0eDNz_jTU,697440,699279,nintendo obviously we've got amiibo
7n0eDNz_jTU,699279,701440,characters they do provide some use in
7n0eDNz_jTU,701440,702800,game and obviously they look pretty
7n0eDNz_jTU,702800,704560,sweet so obviously amiibos you've got a
7n0eDNz_jTU,704560,706640,ton to choose from speaking about the
7n0eDNz_jTU,706640,708320,switch if
7n0eDNz_jTU,708320,710000,you want obviously you can't get a
7n0eDNz_jTU,710000,712320,switch for under 20 but you can get a
7n0eDNz_jTU,712320,714560,screen protector once again dbrand
7n0eDNz_jTU,714560,716399,provides that especially if you use the
7n0eDNz_jTU,716399,718480,switch a ton as an actual console if you
7n0eDNz_jTU,718480,720240,don't plug this in you just want to keep
7n0eDNz_jTU,720240,722720,the screen nice and protected also i'm
7n0eDNz_jTU,722720,724480,just going to include little desk buds
7n0eDNz_jTU,724480,726320,so these are little funko pops obviously
7n0eDNz_jTU,726320,728959,i'm a huge og pokemon fan and i will
7n0eDNz_jTU,728959,730959,tell you my favorite starting pokemon
7n0eDNz_jTU,730959,733760,which i've always told you bulbasaur
7n0eDNz_jTU,733760,737120,nick is team charmander
7n0eDNz_jTU,738160,739040,boo
7n0eDNz_jTU,739040,741120,and lastly for a little desk accessories
7n0eDNz_jTU,741120,742959,i know lego is super expensive i'm a big
7n0eDNz_jTU,742959,744639,lego fan but if you want you can just
7n0eDNz_jTU,744639,746560,have little dudes living off to the side
7n0eDNz_jTU,746560,748800,so that's a little snow speeder and of
7n0eDNz_jTU,748800,751200,course we've got some just stand-alone
7n0eDNz_jTU,751200,753040,lego dudes to kind of complete the
7n0eDNz_jTU,753040,754639,collection if i can get this one to
7n0eDNz_jTU,754639,757959,stand up
7n0eDNz_jTU,758800,760800,under 20 bucks all of this stuff and as
7n0eDNz_jTU,760800,762399,an extra little bonus if you're actually
7n0eDNz_jTU,762399,764240,still paying attention to this video i
7n0eDNz_jTU,764240,766160,always try to include some stuff in vid
7n0eDNz_jTU,766160,767920,to give away so if you actually redeem
7n0eDNz_jTU,767920,770480,this if you are on xbox i believe this
7n0eDNz_jTU,770480,773200,is either a month three months or a year
7n0eDNz_jTU,773200,775680,of xbox game pass so whatever it is the
7n0eDNz_jTU,775680,778000,code is up there nick will zoom in onto
7n0eDNz_jTU,778000,780320,the code if you win it let me know
7n0eDNz_jTU,780320,783279,congrats i'd probably claim that now
7n0eDNz_jTU,783279,785839,okay and to round off we have some
7n0eDNz_jTU,785839,787120,things that are outside of the tech
7n0eDNz_jTU,787120,789440,space under that 20 mark all of these
7n0eDNz_jTU,789440,791120,you've kind of asked questions about so
7n0eDNz_jTU,791120,792880,we'll include them in so for the new
7n0eDNz_jTU,792880,794560,year i picked up some new notebooks i
7n0eDNz_jTU,794560,796320,always try to update them so these are
7n0eDNz_jTU,796320,798720,just 20 22 calendars i kind of use them
7n0eDNz_jTU,798720,800639,for b-roll i obviously use them to jot
7n0eDNz_jTU,800639,802720,down i can never pronounce the name
7n0eDNz_jTU,802720,803600,right
7n0eDNz_jTU,803600,806720,germans correct me leuchtturm neitzen
7n0eDNz_jTU,806720,808800,zebenzine last time i'll say that on
7n0eDNz_jTU,808800,811360,video onto golf ball so i did pick up
7n0eDNz_jTU,811360,814399,golf a lot in 2021 it was the new sport
7n0eDNz_jTU,814399,816720,that i tried to learn so i did grab some
7n0eDNz_jTU,816720,818000,tailor-made balls i'm thankfully
7n0eDNz_jTU,818000,819760,sponsored by team taylormade just a
7n0eDNz_jTU,819760,821600,shameless little plug if you are not
7n0eDNz_jTU,821600,823519,golfing with taylormade balls
7n0eDNz_jTU,823519,825760,pick up your tp5s and the last item to
7n0eDNz_jTU,825760,828320,include which i've probably sadly been
7n0eDNz_jTU,828320,830880,asked the most over youtube especially
7n0eDNz_jTU,830880,832639,with my last little lifestyle vlog that
7n0eDNz_jTU,832639,835680,i made around my day-to-day routine this
7n0eDNz_jTU,835680,838000,is the gel that i use for the hair it is
7n0eDNz_jTU,838000,841279,american crew it's around 15 bucks a tin
7n0eDNz_jTU,841279,843760,i apply maybe a small little dollop
7n0eDNz_jTU,843760,845920,every day kind of push the hair to the
7n0eDNz_jTU,845920,848399,side now you know how i style the hair
7n0eDNz_jTU,848399,850079,and hopefully you will stop asking
7n0eDNz_jTU,850079,852800,questions around what i use so anyways
7n0eDNz_jTU,852800,854880,that is kind of all the tech of the
7n0eDNz_jTU,854880,857279,little lifestyle pieces underneath
7n0eDNz_jTU,857279,859680,20 to 25 bucks so a real good budget
7n0eDNz_jTU,859680,861440,episode to kick off the year hope you
7n0eDNz_jTU,861440,862880,guys enjoyed it and remember leave that
7n0eDNz_jTU,862880,864399,one comment down below i'll probably
