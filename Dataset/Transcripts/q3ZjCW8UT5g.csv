q3ZjCW8UT5g,0,6299,[Music]  this is your turn the time where you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,6299,13160,take risk you take chances push  everything aside this telling you know
q3ZjCW8UT5g,13160,18840,you have the possibility to shape your  identity to construct and build your
q3ZjCW8UT5g,18840,24840,life into the power you can achieve  [Music]  nothing here is stopping your progress
q3ZjCW8UT5g,24840,32099,except yourself you're the only thing  that's holding you back if you want to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,32099,38309,become successful in life I'm the one  you've got to change your mindset he  said you don't get in life what you want
q3ZjCW8UT5g,38309,45480,you get in life what you are develop  your communication skills because once
q3ZjCW8UT5g,45480,53910,you open your mouth you tell the world  who you are I believe that all of us are
q3ZjCW8UT5g,53910,60510,born unique but most of us die copies  you've got to find out what is it that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,60510,67680,turns you on what resonates with you one  of the things that I realized and what
q3ZjCW8UT5g,67680,75270,allowed me to become successful as a  speaker of the speaking industry it's  been hijacked by people who speak to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,75270,83670,sell and this it's okay to do that and  make money I speak to change lives  because somebody spoke and change my
q3ZjCW8UT5g,83670,89759,life so this is my passion this is my  drive this is something that I feel in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,89759,98009,my heart and and so the key to that  Humber Driven Life is a hard centered
q3ZjCW8UT5g,98009,105450,life I didn't do what I'm doing for  years because of my programming because  of the culture in which I was raised in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,105450,111570,I would see other people with with  degrees and PhDs and and MBAs and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,111570,117250,credentials I don't have and I convinced  myself I couldn't do it  [Music]
q3ZjCW8UT5g,117250,123850,but mr. Washington on that day we became  friends and and he taught me not only
q3ZjCW8UT5g,123850,129340,someone's opinion of you this does not  have to determine your reality he said
q3ZjCW8UT5g,129340,137380,that you have to work on yourself you  have to have an unstoppable attitude and  no excuse is acceptable and you've got
q3ZjCW8UT5g,137380,146230,to do make it a priority are  non-negotiable in your life a whole of a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,146230,151600,constant vision of what it is you want  to achieve see it accomplished and go
q3ZjCW8UT5g,151600,158380,all out find a way to win in spite of  the setbacks in spite of the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,158380,163570,disappointments in spite of your  failures I tell people when I'm giving
q3ZjCW8UT5g,163570,170080,presentations you will fail your way to  success I have a saying his life knocks  you down try and land on your back
q3ZjCW8UT5g,170080,175120,because of you could look up you can get  up never let a situation or circumstance
q3ZjCW8UT5g,175120,180730,define your life no matter what it may  be and understanding that you got  something inside of you that's great in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,180730,186190,that situation around a circumstance but  you have to constantly believe it and  not only believe it you have to make
q3ZjCW8UT5g,186190,193080,decisions choices every single day and  put your step forward toward what you  believe your destiny is
q3ZjCW8UT5g,193540,199090,[Music]  in life it's a lot of moments and that's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,199090,206079,a lot of people that change and impact  your life right like I don't believe  it's just one moment you say this one
q3ZjCW8UT5g,206079,211329,moment just changed my life even though  that moment may have but it's going to  be another moment it's going to shape
q3ZjCW8UT5g,211329,216909,and change your life as well either
q3ZjCW8UT5g,216909,222700,somebody is in a midst of adversity or  just came out of adversity or won't be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,222700,228180,long before they head into adversity so  you need to be prepared either way and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,228180,235120,so we all go through adversity  opposition I think that's the thing that  that makes us all in common as people
q3ZjCW8UT5g,235120,241659,right no matter if you're from London  Atlanta Florida California New York like  we're all going to go through something
q3ZjCW8UT5g,241659,247030,at some point or phase in our life right  and as cliche as it sounds when a quote
q3ZjCW8UT5g,247030,253329,says it's never about what happens to  you it's about how you respond to it  that's very true right but in the same
q3ZjCW8UT5g,253329,260139,sense I think what's most important is  when we go through something what's the  perspective that we have of it right
q3ZjCW8UT5g,260139,267150,because for most people when you go  through something the person's natural  perspective is okay what did I lose
q3ZjCW8UT5g,267150,273010,right what happened to me like I took a  loss right people never look at it and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,273010,279340,say okay man tell me what did you gain  right even though I know it hurt you  didn't want to go through it but look at
q3ZjCW8UT5g,279340,284979,it in a way to where you can say what's  the lesson in this right what would you  say life is trying to teach you from
q3ZjCW8UT5g,284979,290259,dealing with this and so when I went  through it my perspective was okay what
q3ZjCW8UT5g,290259,295910,can I extract from it to apply to other  areas and aspects of my life that I feel  can help other people
q3ZjCW8UT5g,295910,302090,[Music]  and I firmly believe the quicker you can
q3ZjCW8UT5g,302090,308810,shift your perspective from yourself to  others when you're in the midst of  adversity the quicker you'll get through
q3ZjCW8UT5g,308810,315920,it  right Martin Luther King has a quote  that says life's most persistent and  urgent question is what are you doing to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,315920,322970,help other people now I'm not telling  you to not acknowledge your pain I'm not  saying I'm not telling you not to say
q3ZjCW8UT5g,322970,329300,man I'm going through this in this heart  I'm not saying it I'm saying when you go  through it look at it step back from the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,329300,335180,picture and say okay I'm dealing with  this 9 out of 10 times there's somebody  else that's neither dealt with it are
q3ZjCW8UT5g,335180,340790,they gonna deal with something similar  to this and if I deal with it in the  right way I can use it to add value to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,340790,348890,lives of other people when you live a  hard centered life deciding that you're
q3ZjCW8UT5g,348890,356090,gonna live a life that will outlive you  you want to live a life that counts a  life that will build a legacy and change
q3ZjCW8UT5g,356090,361280,the planet you know Horace Mann said we  should be ashamed to die until we've
q3ZjCW8UT5g,361280,367550,made some major contribution to  humankind get to know yourself that I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,367550,374960,believe the work taught be not conformed  to this world be it transformed by the  renewing of your mind don't live the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,374960,380330,life that has been given you but when  you go for a walk with someone something
q3ZjCW8UT5g,380330,387140,happens without being spoken is that  either you adjust to their pace or they
q3ZjCW8UT5g,387140,394700,adjust to your pace whose pace have you  adjusted to and so the things that we
q3ZjCW8UT5g,394700,400540,pick up and we think that there are  choices but the  the choices that we've been programmed
q3ZjCW8UT5g,400540,408360,by life to do when we leave our homes in  the morning we're bombarded with over
q3ZjCW8UT5g,408360,414760,6000 advertising hits through Facebook  through Twitter through Instagram
q3ZjCW8UT5g,414760,422260,through television through our phones  and through our communities and through  the computers and so all of these things
q3ZjCW8UT5g,422260,427930,are impacting us every day so if you  don't have a program for your mind then
q3ZjCW8UT5g,427930,435610,your mind is going to be programming  you'll find yourself doing things that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,435610,441190,you did not know and and that they  affected you that they through marketing
q3ZjCW8UT5g,441190,447940,techniques and strategies that they will  create a thirst within you you've got to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,447940,453910,have someone that can see something in  you that you can't see that that that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,453910,462040,can take you to a place within yourself  that you can't go by yourself stop
q3ZjCW8UT5g,462040,467350,overthinking everything so much realize  that while you are trying to do a lot of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,467350,474580,things in your life at once and you are  trying to be better than you were  yesterday also realize you don't have to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,474580,482020,try to do anything you just have to do  and you just have to be you have to  understand the concept of you're not
q3ZjCW8UT5g,482020,487390,actually really doing anything you're  being done each and every day is an
q3ZjCW8UT5g,487390,494050,opportunity to get something from the  day rather than just going through the  day but there are a lot of things that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,494050,500140,we can't always control we can't always  control the temperature outside we can't  always control what the birds are doing
q3ZjCW8UT5g,500140,505960,or what the fish are doing or what the  animals are doing but we can control  what we're doing we can control who
q3ZjCW8UT5g,505960,512169,we're hanging out with so in a sense we  can get some control over the anxiety  that we have and the way that we're
q3ZjCW8UT5g,512169,519820,going to gain control over those things  is think about some of the hurdles that  we may have some of the things that are  blocking us from making quick quick
q3ZjCW8UT5g,519820,525250,action  the reason that out I think belief is
q3ZjCW8UT5g,525250,530740,important is because like when you're  younger when you do something in your
q3ZjCW8UT5g,530740,537070,novice right and you start out doing it  and you might think you can do something  with it or you might not you might do it
q3ZjCW8UT5g,537070,542230,in this being driven by your passion and  then somebody comes along that's a  little bit older or even more
q3ZjCW8UT5g,542230,547690,experienced and they can see it in a way  that you can't see it right and so I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,547690,554080,think is important with belief because  if a person believes you in a way that  you don't believe in yourself you can
q3ZjCW8UT5g,554080,560050,rent that person's belief until you get  strong enough to possess your own right  and you use that person's belief to fuel
q3ZjCW8UT5g,560050,566140,you every single day right because you  can have a level of belief with what  you're doing but you can go back to a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,566140,572950,certain set of circumstances that tell  you now it's not gonna happen and so you  read that person's belief until you get
q3ZjCW8UT5g,572950,578380,strong enough to possess your own life
q3ZjCW8UT5g,578380,583750,is an adventure and it's gonna be a  challenge and get ready because you're
q3ZjCW8UT5g,583750,590410,gonna fail your way to success you will  get slapped around by life and don't  spend time complaining about it and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,590410,596279,telling everybody 80 percent don't care  and 20 percent glad is you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,596279,601410,I think the number one thing that keeps
q3ZjCW8UT5g,601410,606540,people from being successful is their  fear a whole bunch of different forms
q3ZjCW8UT5g,606540,612509,you know sometimes it's about the people  around you and how they'll perceive you  you know because you know maybe you grew
q3ZjCW8UT5g,612509,619110,up in a household where you know things  weren't accepted or you know maybe your  parents didn't accomplish things and  then they put that kind of insecurity on
q3ZjCW8UT5g,619110,626309,you these are the things that I feel  like sometimes it prevents people from  being who they want to be because all it
q3ZjCW8UT5g,626309,631649,takes is somebody wanting to take a step  you know and there are certain things  that a lot of people in this world and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,631649,637079,they're thinking in their minds and  they're just not gonna do like I used to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,637079,643230,always try to pull a lot of people and  be like you what you can do this you can  do this but the people that hear that  motivation over and over again sometimes
q3ZjCW8UT5g,643230,649649,they take that step some people just  have it in them early it just starts and  they just get in the muscle memory of  just doing things there's so many things
q3ZjCW8UT5g,649649,654839,not last we were scared about what we're  still here we made it past all these  things and if you fail so what you know
q3ZjCW8UT5g,654839,660959,you start over you do it again but most  people that that fear of failure is the  thing that I think prevents them from
q3ZjCW8UT5g,660959,666329,like really really being successful then  also it's like a lot of other things  that are just difficult to do you know
q3ZjCW8UT5g,666329,673860,when you tell people the answer to  success it's a lot of hard stuff  let your success fill itself around you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,673860,679800,let it construct around you  you got to work hard right nobody wants
q3ZjCW8UT5g,679800,686100,to hear that everybody wants a shortcut  you know some people understand that  they like they appreciate the progress  you know if you tell people right now
q3ZjCW8UT5g,686100,692939,hey if you want to lose this many pounds  this is what you got to do there's no  short solution but every time there's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,692939,699209,still people out there selling whatever  Herbalife treatment or whatever to try  to get you the quick short route because  people believe that you know what I'm
q3ZjCW8UT5g,699209,705420,gonna do it the easy way and there is no  easy way so when I tell the--with that  is very blunt it's very straight to it
q3ZjCW8UT5g,705420,710999,you have to want to do it but the best  way I trying to explain it is like you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,710999,718079,know when you're chiseling on a rock you  know you can chisel for a long time and  you can chisel 100 times 200 times 300
q3ZjCW8UT5g,718079,724439,times and it won't break and then when  you get to five thousand times you're  finally breaks but all the work that you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,724439,730350,did is what made it break  it's not like you just the last one just  broke it you know I mean it takes that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,730350,736360,but sometimes people don't want to start  their journey  mission of light you know becoming the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,736360,743260,best that they can be move away from  your past and move toward a new purpose
q3ZjCW8UT5g,743260,750820,a purpose that gives you the success  you've always wanted the success that  leads you to a future you deserve bring
q3ZjCW8UT5g,750820,757660,your life into the direction you want  the direction to change your perception  your perspective this is the power
q3ZjCW8UT5g,757660,764410,you've earned don't let yourself be  taken by one more mistake don't let  yourself slip from one more wasted
q3ZjCW8UT5g,764410,771700,opportunity have the confidence to take  action have the confidence to appreciate
q3ZjCW8UT5g,771700,780430,the decisions you make to make every  choice with the purpose with the purpose  to change to improve as a collective a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,780430,786520,society we all want similar things we  all want to succeed to improve to be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,786520,792730,better people we all slip but that's how  life functions that's the only way for
q3ZjCW8UT5g,792730,801820,us to learn you can be more you can have  I felt like we spend way more time in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,801820,808000,our own minds than we do talking to  other people like you really spend a lot  of time trying to figure it out there's  all these thoughts that come to you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,808000,814330,whether it's like you know things around  you people talking to you people close  to you things you see TV whatever and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,814330,819520,you're you're bringing in all these  different things trying to figure out  your path in life you know so I think it
q3ZjCW8UT5g,819520,827020,starts with having some like real  understanding of what your strengths are  it's about being honest you know a lot
q3ZjCW8UT5g,827020,832180,of people just aren't honest with  themselves you're telling yourself this  thing but you're like there's so many  people that say oh I'm gonna be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,832180,838780,entrepreneur I'm gonna do this and it  can really dive down into deep they  don't really believe it you know and  it's that's okay you can unlock that but
q3ZjCW8UT5g,838780,844870,you have to figure out how to unlock it  there's a conscience that's sitting  right here telling you this thing and  you try to brush it off you have to be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,844870,850750,very honest with yourself and then if  you're not that doesn't mean you can't  succeed it means that now you're very
q3ZjCW8UT5g,850750,856760,honest and knowing you're not as  good then you can work on getting good  but if you think you're already good at  it you don't work on it so I spent a lot
q3ZjCW8UT5g,856760,862779,of time just reflecting our late man  what am I good at like I used to think  like I'm watching NBA you know I was
q3ZjCW8UT5g,862779,868790,unrealistic about it you know you start  to see people that are way bigger way  faster you're not telling yourself the  truth he's just like no I'm going to the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,868790,874910,NBA you start with doing what you're  passionate about right because there are
q3ZjCW8UT5g,874910,881769,a lot of people that are going through  life right now trying to figure it out  like me I don't know what I want to be I  don't know like I was at that moment
q3ZjCW8UT5g,881800,887379,it's not about money I want to make it  very clear the money will come if you  focus on passion and focus on
q3ZjCW8UT5g,887379,893319,information and relationship and I'm  gonna stand on the top of the mountain  and seeing that all day and hopefully it
q3ZjCW8UT5g,893319,899410,has a real impact on people's lives and  I'ma feel good about that I'm not gonna  feel good if I go to the grave as being
q3ZjCW8UT5g,899410,906970,the only person with the information and  the money gonna tell us money I'm gonna  feel good if I'm able to impact a lot of  people and that don't have access to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,906970,913739,this information and a good life or  quality of life and they have one that's  awesome that makes me feel real good I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,913739,921660,think the true measure of wealth is uh  is happiness right like I really do and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,921660,927009,it's not saying that I'm against money  I'm not against that at all because you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,927009,933279,gotta gotta work hard make your money to  take care of your family and be able to  bless people but I think it's a lot of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,933279,940329,people with so-called wealth and they  don't have joy and they don't have  happiness right and I feel like joy
q3ZjCW8UT5g,940329,946660,happiness is peak and peace it's the  most important things we can possess  right then for most people their
q3ZjCW8UT5g,946660,953740,material possessions they feel like the  most important for me we got joy me you  got peace when you got happiness I think
q3ZjCW8UT5g,953740,959679,that's true well because you can't put a  price on that you having a purpose it's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,959679,964869,that thing that that makes us tick that  gets us up every day and gets us over
q3ZjCW8UT5g,964869,972610,the hump of opposition and adversity and  a reason that I champion that versed in  opposition is because I think for the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,972610,979779,most part in life people pretty much  know what to do when things go right  right like when things go right they
q3ZjCW8UT5g,979779,985100,know how to feel they know how to act  to react but it's when that opposition
q3ZjCW8UT5g,985100,991250,and that adversity comes and it creates  a level of misunderstanding right now
q3ZjCW8UT5g,991250,999410,the vision is blurred now you don't have  clarity about what you're supposed to do  now you question if your existence
q3ZjCW8UT5g,999410,1005529,matters and I think when you have a  purpose it's powerful because in the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1005529,1013690,midst of the opposition it makes you  realize that you've been put here for  certain reason that you can be great but
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1013690,1019360,you live in unreserved right you didn't  you didn't empty the bucket right you  didn't give everything you had to every
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1019360,1024520,aspect of your life like for most people  they're great professionally but they
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1024520,1029589,end up becoming a public success and  behind closed doors they're private  failure not because they don't have the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1029589,1037240,talent or the skill set they don't have  the character right that they can apply  it and be consistent in every aspect of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1037240,1043808,their life and empty out everything they  got to everything all right now one  would say okay well when do you turn it
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1043808,1050980,back right you find pockets to turn in  right of course you don't just give  everything you've got all the time right
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1050980,1056290,you get to a point to where you learn to  be efficient and effective in every
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1056290,1062860,aspect of your life and for most people  is not a problem the skill set there's a  problem with character and empty the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1062860,1070200,bucket is having the right character to  be consistent and empty out everything  you've got in every aspect of your life
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1070200,1075640,either somebody is in the midst of  adversity or just came out of adversity
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1075640,1084140,or won't be known  they head into adversity so you need to  be prepared either way and so we all go
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1084140,1090530,through and ersity opposition I think  that's the thing that that makes us all  in common as people biomatter if you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1090530,1097700,from London Atlanta Florida California  New York but we're all going to go  through something at some point or phase
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1097700,1104060,in our life right and as cliche as it  sounds when the Pope says it's never  about what happens to us about how you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1104060,1110690,respond to you that's very true right  but in the same sense I think what's  most important is when we go through
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1110690,1117020,something what's the perspective that we  have on right because for most people  when you go through something the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1117020,1122180,person's natural perspective is okay  what did I lose right what happened to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1122180,1127190,me like I took a loss I people never  look at it and say okay man tell me what
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1127190,1134000,did you gain right even though I know it  hurt you didn't want to go do it but  look at it in a way to where you can say
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1134000,1140240,what's the lesson in it right what would  you say life is trying to teach you from  dealing with this and so when I went
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1140240,1145670,through it my perspective was okay what  can I extract from you to apply to other
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1145670,1151460,areas and aspects of my life that I feel  can help other people and I finally
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1151460,1156710,believe the quicker you can shift your  perspective from yourself to others when
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1156710,1162020,you're in the midst of adversity the  quicker you'll get through it right  Martin Luther King has a quote that says
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1162020,1169250,life's most persistent and urgent  question is what are you doing to help  other people now I'm not telling you to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1169250,1174260,not acknowledge your pain I'm not saying  I'm not telling you not to say man I'm
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1174260,1179900,going through this in his heart I'm not  saying that I'm saying when you go  through it look at it step back from the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1179900,1185810,picture and say okay I'm dealing with  this 9 out of 10 times there's somebody  else that's either dealt with it are
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1185810,1191210,they gonna deal with something similar  to this and if I deal with it in the  right way I can use it to add value to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1191210,1194350,lives of other people
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1196230,1202380,like when we go through a situation in  circumstance it's easy to step back and  think and I just went through this and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1202380,1207510,it's just my experience I firmly believe  when we go through things it's for us to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1207510,1213720,deal with it get over it and reach back  over the hill to help another person and  a lot of times like you said when you're
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1213720,1219480,trying to work through it you think man  how can I help somebody and I'm trying  to get through it myself right and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1219480,1225630,that's a great perspective right but  when you get through it right maybe you  can't help them when you're in the midst
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1225630,1231570,of it because you're processing it but  when you get over the hill I think is  that important and I think it's vital
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1231570,1237480,that you reach back over the hill and  help somebody that may be going through  a similar situation and you can share
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1237480,1243390,your values and principles with them  because that experience that we go  through and we do it it's not just for
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1243390,1250620,us before the Sun rises is the time of  least distraction before the Sun rises  where you can build intimacy and fluency
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1250620,1255929,with what you want to stand for in your  day before the Sun rises the luxury and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1255929,1260970,tranquility of the early morning hours  you can do that deep inner work that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1260970,1267630,will allow you to go out from the world  and play it your best we live in a world
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1267630,1274230,where a lot of people are busy being  busy but what's the point in being busy  around climbing the wrong Mount Everest
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1274230,1279649,and so clarity is one of the DNA's of  mastery
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1282430,1288100,but if you look at the greatest  billionaires if you look at the greatest  producers on the planet these people are
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1288100,1293320,one thing in common they are  ridiculously curious and no matter how  much money they make it no matter how
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1293320,1299980,much impact they have they maintain a  white belt mentality one of the keys to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1299980,1306490,epic performance is a relentless  commitment to daily breath as you begin
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1306490,1312190,your day so you handcraft  the rest of your day and if you have  consistently great days you're gonna
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1312190,1318850,have consistently great weeks quarters a  year and a lifetime we live in a world
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1318850,1324580,that suggests the doorway to successes  swings outward if you build the business
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1324580,1330520,if you get the jet if you get the money  if you get the cars if you get the  beautiful spouse then you're gonna be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1330520,1336310,happy what I believe and there's a model  in the five am club that I think is a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1336310,1343480,very disruptive model but it's a  transformational it's called the for  interior empires and it's not just
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1343480,1349840,mindset it's mindset heart set Hal  sentence also but I worked on those for
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1349840,1355750,interior empires when I was a very  unhappy litigation like I've made money
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1355750,1362890,I was successful I to law degrees and  then I wake up every morning Tom and I'd  go into the bathroom mirror and I look
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1362890,1369390,at myself and I was a completely empty  person and nothing
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1369690,1376020,is more expensive and losing your joy  and peace of mind and so what I did was
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1376020,1382680,I started working on myself yeah I  worked on my mindset and I read all the  books and went to the courses but that's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1382680,1388800,only your psychology I think that's one  of the missing links in our field which  is everyone's talking about mindset but
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1388800,1396330,mindset is just your belief system is  just your psychologies it's very  important but that's 25% of the personal
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1396330,1402140,mastery equation I believe the second  piece is your heart set I worked on that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1402140,1407880,purifying your heart  that's your emotionality not just your  psychology you're never gonna make
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1407880,1413820,history  dominate your domain and handcraft a  world-class life if you've got a great
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1413820,1418950,psychology that you're carrying the pain  and sadness disappointment and trauma of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1418950,1425430,the past so I worked on my hearts up  your health set don't die if you want to  change the world like dead people don't
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1425430,1433110,change the world what have you done  today to be different what have you done
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1433110,1441960,to step outside the conventions that you  set for yourself the conventions and the  rules set by your past today you have
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1441960,1449070,the power to move on today you have the  power to move away from your past and  move towards a successful future this is
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1449070,1454100,your decision your call to make into  your future
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1454100,1461670,this is how your life can gain its own  direction and this is where your life  can be so much more so much better you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1461670,1468600,can make it better you have always had  the potential to take one more step the  potential to take the risks others are
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1468600,1475500,too scared to take because you are more  and you are stronger and you have the  determination and the courage to be so
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1475500,1482620,much more  know how to be someone better to look  for something better to become someone
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1482620,1488380,with the purpose to constantly look for  change to always look for somewhere to  improve for somewhere to be better
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1488380,1495610,because this is where you begin  you own your success so let it take
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1495610,1501010,control take control of your life and  take control of your power this is where
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1501010,1507820,the power is in your control get after  it in guard in the world every single
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1507820,1514960,morning  people might ridicule you because every  genius is ridiculed before their revered  people might throw stones at you but you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1514960,1521080,use them to build monuments of mastery  people might not misunderstand you  because any disrupter is gonna be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1521080,1530710,misunderstood and even you're if you're  an army of one a Galileo or Steve Jobs  or how Phil Knight you continue at all
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1530710,1537250,costs so it all starts with who you are  because you'll never rise any higher  than what's going on in a video what
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1537250,1545740,terrifies you most go directly there  because discomfort is simply growth in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1545740,1554950,wolf's clothing to lead and to become a  great hero or in every day hero the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1554950,1562150,doorway is through embracing our  suffering and doing difficult thing I  think pleasure has been promoted too
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1562150,1569580,much in our society like no great Titan  of industry no legendary cellist no
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1569580,1577750,great athlete you know the great ones  all understand that suffering is the  price of greatness so how do we become
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1577750,1584940,braver you do you do the difficult  things that you don't feel like doing  but you know have the pale
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1585400,1591080,it'll be crazy the great leaders are  insane and I say that they're insane to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1591080,1598820,the majority the great ones are all  misfits and they're all weird I mean the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1598820,1604610,very nature of being a disrupter and  leader means you're not a following and  if they're not a follower then you're
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1604610,1610640,not buying the kool-aid that society  sells you if you're not a follower  you're not like this all the time you're
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1610640,1617750,looking for likes if you're not a  follower you dress the way you want a  dress people criticize you they
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1617750,1622970,criticize all the great ones critics are  nothing more than dreamers who got
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1622970,1632090,scared and never got off their chairs  and got back in the game so you've got  to be willing to be to 5:00 a.m. weird
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1632090,1637250,who does that why not sleep leaders have
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1637250,1642740,to be willing not to be followers stop
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1642740,1648250,blaming others stop blaming people for  the reasons you find yourself in now
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1648250,1654260,stop blaming your situation stop blaming  your parents stop blaming the government
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1654260,1662440,stop blaming your genetic stop blaming  your finances stop blaming your past
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1662440,1669140,Clawd yourself back into the light stop  blaming everybody else the only person
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1669140,1674480,you can truly blame issue because you  are the only person who can get yourself
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1674480,1680000,out of it live life a victor not a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1680000,1685570,victim  you might even be right you might be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1685570,1692320,poor because of your parents are broken  because of no relationship you're red  but what does blaming people or society
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1692320,1697869,do for you it will keep you in the same  hole and all you're doing is digging the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1697869,1703960,hole even world it's because your  situation where you right now hasn't
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1703960,1711279,changed in order to go forward and to  get out of the hole is growth instead of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1711279,1718840,bringing other people down to your level  build yourself up to them  Clawd yourself out of that hole and you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1718840,1725169,will get to see the Sun and once again  massive success is how you prove people
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1725169,1732220,wrong and prove yourself right the only  way you get upstream is to swim against
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1732220,1740330,the company  you're permanently ruining your future  you're holding your progress life is
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1740330,1747350,made not to be easy not one's life is  ever easy how did you ever think you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1747350,1753800,were ever going to make any progress you  can make this your time you can take
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1753800,1758930,control of the life you want to live  have the authority to know what you need
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1758930,1765440,to change to know how to change and then  let's take action have discipline for
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1765440,1771080,yourself into progress switch over to  make your life
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1771080,1776690,all difficult situations forced you to  make improvements force you to learn to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1776690,1782930,educate yourself prove this to yourself  make others jealous make yourself
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1782930,1789320,jealous like you're gonna only be so  pretty you're only gonna be so smart
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1789320,1794410,like you like there's there's things  that are gonna be natural and there's  things that you can actually control I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1794410,1802070,do believe and I don't know if I'm right  or wrong I don't but I do believe that  work ethic is a taught behavior it's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1802070,1808690,something you do have more control over  I feel like there's a shift that can
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1808690,1814360,make people work harder the big one that  I push is you're gonna die like like if
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1814360,1820090,your complaint like to me life is broken  down into complaining and not so if  you're not complaining well then I know
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1820090,1827269,I have no advice for you but I'm pumped  like you did it  we're beating ourselves up like
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1827269,1833029,everybody sucks at something right like  we all have shortcomings and we all have
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1833029,1838340,strengths and for me it's like why don't  we just audit that like why don't we  just look at it that way
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1838340,1843380,and be like all right well I'm good at  this but I'm not good at that like and  then and then and then I only focus what
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1843380,1851539,I'm good at  right like I don't dwell that I can't  fix it around the house I call somebody  to fix it don't lose yourself on the way
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1851539,1856658,to the top they'll never be a better you  than you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1857540,1863059,rarely is a question of talent or  technique it's just one of the belief
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1863059,1868950,and the concomitant will to kind of do  something that either no one's done
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1868950,1875130,before or even more I think the crack  opened the barriers that people consider
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1875130,1880800,impossible or undoable and that kind of  belief I think is rarer than talent
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1880800,1885870,talent is it's around having both of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1885870,1891600,those levels there's only a few people  that they really have that I think in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1891600,1898640,the history they're the ones that it  really changed things when you're  looking at everything it's such a gift
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1898640,1906210,to be able to look at something and to  love it for the sake of it in nurturing
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1906210,1916050,and maintaining that is one of the  hardest tests of any pearl much less for
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1916050,1925890,anyone to find right what is the  Beethoven who never found his piano or  harpsichord or right those days you want
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1925890,1931050,to go out and hurt - you're sore or you  just suck Union you're not making
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1931050,1937800,progress you're burning it to the end  you feel defeated but that's that's the  nature of love you know it's got hate in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1937800,1946350,there you know it's got pain in there  and it draws you to it that's the  magnetism I see people with talent with
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1946350,1951690,all those things but the one thing they  don't have is that just love for doing
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1951690,1957510,it for the sake of it in the sense of  obligation to do something with what
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1957510,1963200,you're given you know  there's something to that it's important
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1963200,1970400,I think getting what you want quenches  the fire that got you there often unless
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1970400,1976820,is something replaced by something more  permanent which becomes more intangible
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1976820,1983540,I think the successes of winning right  you want to be the best in the  neighborhood and then win the local
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1983540,1990710,contest and then whatever whatever its  it just keeps going up and then by the  time you get there you can have a  stadium scream in your name it's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1990710,1996980,actually happened a couple of times and  there is a visceral excelent  exhilaration to a dirtiness I've
q3ZjCW8UT5g,1996980,2002440,experienced that I know what that's like  you land a trick in there it just lights
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2002440,2009429,up it's crazy at the same time it's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2009429,2017340,hollow it's hollow that's not the thing  that can drive you and he's not for long
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2017340,2023920,it's being able to say oh I had that I  had a model or I had people out of there
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2023920,2029710,or whatever all of these honors  eventually that stuff fades to just
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2029710,2036460,static and you're left with you and your  board if you decide that that's what you  love that's what you're doing then your
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2036460,2041890,days are numbered so the trick is to  always peel back of why am I doing this
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2041890,2048580,in the first place it is easy to say and  I think it's smothering to say and often
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2048580,2054889,there's a culture of saying that if if  it cannot be proven it must not be  possible
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2054889,2060050,in the big takeaway from that theorem is  that there's lots of things that cannot
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2060050,2063580,be proven though they are correct
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2065740,2071720,because we see things so often in front  of us the way that it should be done and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2071720,2079240,it imposes a kind of barrier through  what people know and see a familiarity
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2079240,2087500,but maybe you can change something  within you that can be just outside a  new set of axioms some new skill set
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2087500,2092530,they will take you further and I think  that's the history of development
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2092560,2100370,it's interesting how getting what you  think you want can end up being the  force that pushes you in to paint
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2100370,2106400,yourself into a corner pushes you into  room there's something terrible to be  taught the mountain I'm the best I'm the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2106400,2113570,king guarding it there's a Nietzsche  quote right what's left for you when you  make it at the top but lightning you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2113570,2117579,know  [Music]
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2119640,2124950,is this admitster it's everybody has a  unique set of variables that they can
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2124950,2133980,put in place and express their  individual identity in a form of call it  greatness that's something to be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2133980,2140559,remembered that's what you look for  [Music]  it's not there's anything just find your
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2140559,2147520,light in what you do for the sake of it  and then recognize how you're being  shaped in the process and hopefully you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2147520,2154779,become a better man through it's not

q3ZjCW8UT5g,2374990,2382520,tumble forward over time may become what  you do and you find hopefully at the end
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2382520,2389270,of that process  you're not insufferable that you  actually have something to give it can
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2389270,2396500,be present you know so for all I've done  I appreciate I don't look at it as much
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2396500,2404270,but ultimately it just goes out there  it's just what you do you just become
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2404270,2412430,one with that I think that's been a key  for me of why I've been able to sustain  this fire that's so seemingly easily
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2412430,2418040,clinched so when I see people who have  had success
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2418040,2423890,I see boredom for the most part in them  and then I see a Tim stone
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2423890,2430940,and circling back to what trophies and  those things represented right Fineman  great physicists said that is the Nobel
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2430940,2437019,Prize would be the tombstone and all  great work just look at it I haven't  done the study of Academy Awards right
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2437019,2444799,but usually when you get what you  thought you wanted a fire goes away I'm
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2444799,2449920,honored to have had the rippling impact
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2449920,2455450,that I have helped formulate the  language
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2455450,2465079,of a community where others can help  shape and express themselves in a  process and connect that to me for
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2465079,2471069,people like me that doesn't come easily
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2471250,2476910,but ultimately this would be a good man  you know
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2476910,2482280,[Music]  you ever hear that goofy internet thing  you've found it so stupid stuff that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2482280,2490950,people send you can you name the last  Nobel Prize when there's an Olympians  alright but you can name the fifth-grade
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2490950,2497359,teacher that had faith in you right it's  the people you touch the singularly  [Music]
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2497359,2503000,that's a bigger test in a way what does  it take to be the best everything
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2503000,2509970,everything you can't you're going to  have self doubts you're gonna have tough
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2509970,2515430,moments you're gonna have everything you  know you're gonna have people talking  bad about you people putting you down
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2515430,2523680,getting caught you know it takes getting  up in the morning and doing the same  thing you know I understand people talk
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2523680,2530280,about a lot of mental toughness right  many toughness you meditate and stuff  for me honestly mental toughness is
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2530280,2535440,getting up in the morning and doing the  same thing Dane and they are Dane and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2535440,2542579,they are for whatever you take whatever  that goal is you know and by doing that  you became the best you know and it
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2542579,2548569,takes everything I mean you have to I  mean the three exes that I love you know  suffer you know a sacrifice it suffered
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2548569,2555930,sacrifice equal success you gotta suffer  you know it's gonna be it's gonna suck  you know like I mean I worked what 15
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2555930,2562079,hours a day I'll get up you know and  then trying to stay in shape imagine  that as yeah the 17 year old European in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2562079,2568230,Boston with spoken English there's a lot  of suffer a lot of sacrifice you know I  don't have any friends or girlfriend or
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2568230,2574950,any anywhere to go right I'll just  working working working working and then  success can be you know later because I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2574950,2582029,build this foundation so takes  everything you know but it's not for  long you know people think that to be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2582029,2588119,greater to be something really good it's  a lifetime it's not no because once you  achieve that that's another thing right
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2588119,2593940,but by building the right foundation day  in and day out you achieve something and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2593940,2599839,that leaves one other thing opens up to  a deep traditional  it takes everything you know and what is
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2599839,2605359,everything is your mind in your body you  know people are wishful thinkers you  know I want to be the best I want to be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2605359,2610759,rich I want to lose weight whatever that  you know the wishful thinking is you  know but I hate to take the steps or
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2610759,2616880,they take the steps and it's hard you  know change is hard you know changing  your body changing your mind is very
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2616880,2623360,hard and people stop and people comes a  certain point everybody
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2623360,2630290,so everything is making up your mind  mentally and not giving up but also  physically pushing through your hearts
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2630290,2638810,if you know when it hurt to be an  Olympian right you spent four years for
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2638810,2644240,two weeks or maybe one week because you  might lose and get out so it's a you  know it's a crazy work workforce and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2644240,2651890,disciplining mindset right so to be able  to play in greece and then go have a  chance to go to china i was blown away
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2651890,2659090,by my by my ability right when you call  about self-doubt i'm like there's no  self-doubt I'm now I'm the man so I was
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2659090,2666020,the captain I was at peak of you know  the peak of my career we just lost him  in Athens and as a group we were a young
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2666020,2671600,group that joined the team in 2000 we  were young in Athens and then we made a  pact to ourselves that we're gonna win
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2671600,2679400,gold in China we actually made a plan  how when why right and we went to work  went to work on slowly you know build
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2679400,2685760,that the foundation in 2007 now I was in  Italy playing for the best team or the  captain making a ton of money and then I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2685760,2692330,turn and then my achilles nap I fall  down in tremendous pain because as to a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2692330,2697460,structure actually this one comes out we  can walk and go the doctor the second  one is the hardest thing it snaps in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2697460,2702650,half so I fall down and I see my foot  hanging and I can move my toes
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2702650,2709820,I mean my toes I'm like I'm trying to my  cane I'm just crying because there's so  much pain and shock the doctor comes in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2709820,2715760,and a persisting that he lives and just  ha spend all that oil our killers a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2715760,2720859,newly downtown that version is done I  mean when he said that I was like no and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2720859,2726290,I just burst in tears and several years  to do this and you know truly American
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2726290,2731680,Dream and hardship it's over in a matter  of one minute
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2734280,2739480,myself dad was like I'm done with USA  team and that scared me you know because
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2739480,2745270,for me what that was most important  thing not professionally not the money  you know being part of the USA team on
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2745270,2751000,that group of guys and that you know  that amazing tournament is just you know  there's nothing like that in life you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2751000,2756250,know because the whole experience it in  Greece and now I'm the captain of a team  so there was the number one self doubt
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2756250,2762490,and that you know kind of stroke of fear  I mean I had to sit 26 days with a leg
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2762490,2768220,up above your heart not move anything  and a lot of thoughts came to my mind  you know I mean thoughts about quitting
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2768220,2773560,out of 32  thank God wasn't social media back then  so you know can be good you know I'm
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2773560,2780190,couldn't back right but you know friends  were supportive but they're like you  know man  32 you know maybe take the real-estate
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2780190,2787000,test you know maybe think about the  future maybe think about that and then  once all these people start doubting I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2787000,2792940,start pushing me away you know even my  parents you know my parents were still  conservative in working a small job you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2792940,2798220,know in in a small town say you know son  I mean awesome and you made it like what  else you want you know like
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2798220,2804430,you're the man like you know for bein  e'en that minute you're garland I said  but I want to be the best player in the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2804430,2810070,world and I didn't achieve that dream  you know since 11 since 9 I thought my  dream has been to be the best in the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2810070,2816250,world so why this injury will stop me so  I started researching I said what is the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2816250,2821650,compact time for Achilles I start doing  a lot of research and I start I made a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2821650,2827950,bet with myself was weird one of these  nights you know immediately as I got  better at weight to three months of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2827950,2833410,flight back to USA  I was drinking wine you know and I  couldn't walk you know still with with
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2833410,2839830,crushes and I say you know what it's  gonna be a test between me and Achilles  honestly I mean that was like I made a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2839830,2846130,bet with myself I'm like who's gonna win  so my mind started working on that  moment in a moment of like okay
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2846130,2851530,how long they take what work do I have  to do how to do it where and then one
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2851530,2858100,side the plan I just wake up every  morning I was the first one at the USA  team and eyes and stretch and the last
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2858100,2864990,one to go so was just a simple bed near  near the lake and I want
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2864990,2871530,at the Olympic team every four years  Summer Olympics the cost comes in brings  all the guys about 30 40 guys that try
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2871530,2878190,out for you know four years and then she  sits down and tells the team who makes  her or not it's a very very ruthless
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2878190,2884820,decision right and the coach comes in  and he said you know put a list of a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2884820,2891290,team and I I got upset the first time  Tom that I became Albania Man III the Oh  bene of me came out now just became
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2891290,2898170,angry and loud I don't know why you know  cutting me like you know are you stupid
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2898170,2903960,I crazy and I'm cussing at the coach  he's like he gets it  thank God you know he took the high road
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2903960,2910980,you know just calm me down and we're  just talking for two hours and and I was  crushed  you know like I kind of went back to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2910980,2917010,that old mentality you know and that  summer I kind of give up you know that  summer I was drinking clean Beach water
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2917010,2924359,go for fun I was weird it was just very  odd mix of feelings I didn't know how to  control them I had no idea back then I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2924359,2932070,was engaged and then break up with my  with my fiance - I start darling  everything right and my Italian team
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2932070,2937950,that I was playing had a big contract  for three years massive amount of money  and they cut me they said we don't pay

q3ZjCW8UT5g,2957959,2964049,forget about Europe USA team and  everything I shall shall be on my own  there was the best medicine ever you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2964049,2970019,know because that's when you really find  yourself you gotta hit rock bottom when
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2970019,2975059,they say right and I realize that I was  painting everybody else by myself I was
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2975059,2980640,like man I plan to coach my fiance the  team the Italian manager everybody but
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2980640,2986249,me first time of my life that I was  maybe I become too cocky or confident I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2986249,2992669,don't know but I realized I was blaming  everybody else by myself so I made  another bet with myself I said I'll
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2992669,2998099,never  from this moment on I'll never allow  anybody or anything else to dictate my
q3ZjCW8UT5g,2998099,3004219,life it's gonna be my way and I called  the coach like gonna try out I'll study  3:30 for the coach that are you crazy
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3004219,3010699,I'm like I will try out you put me at  the bottom of the list I want to earn it  done and went to work instead of getting
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3010699,3018009,a crappy contract I went to Italy got a  cheap contract and I proved myself again  and I became the other side of the world
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3018329,3024000,you gotta hit that you know it's about  experience no my thing like if you don't  have that experience if you're not
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3024000,3030880,[Music]  confident to go through this experience  there are people when the people when  people go through tough times they
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3030880,3037180,protect themselves they go into this  show right it goes and we as humans as  you know you know our mind you know from
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3037180,3043749,back back in the day was to protect  yourself you know from fire from  fighting so human mind is always kind of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3043749,3049599,like being to be no risk it's not good  for you you know to go hike over the  mountain right it's bad for you right
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3049599,3054759,everything is bad and I was like no no  no I mean I can do I have to take this
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3054759,3059799,raise I have to push myself out to  suffer you know I have to sacrifice in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3059799,3064940,order to achieve that success otherwise  I'll never be that guy that I wanted to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3064940,3071839,[Music]  first of all to get up every day and not
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3071839,3077660,work others you know being a great  teammate you know being great part of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3077660,3084199,whatever team it is you know whatever  wherever you are at school with your  friends  that's force you know being a great
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3084199,3090890,person around your teammates you know  and lastly it's like don't burn bridges  I told my kidding across ours I went
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3090890,3097400,through a lot of ups and downs we know  sorry I you know I burn few bridges by  mistake  you know I many of those bridges now you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3097400,3103099,know I went back and apologized you know  because I was in the dark space but you  know I say you know it's you as good as
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3103099,3108739,a person next to you know you as good as  that mentor or business person or  teacher or coach you know you know you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3108739,3114739,know alone is very hard to make you know  people will actually help you if you ask  for help but you gotta show them that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3114739,3123109,you are hardworking a good person and  then success always comes whatever that  is monetarily or passion or whatever
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3123109,3131529,that is for you and no it always comes  if you do that work but I'm going to  come to you nobody's gonna give it to  you but you know when things are hard
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3131529,3137719,when you're in a dark place there's  still light you know it's just a matter  of you know switching your mentality and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3137719,3144049,I was switching that thought process and  continue to work for the right thing and  it's not scary just because they sound
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3144049,3150699,scary they're not scary no it's just the  way you look at them you gotta get down  this
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3153830,3159860,I see that fear and I'm like I'm running  right through it you know there's  nothing that's gonna help me just times
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3159860,3166490,I'm flying in the plane I'm like this  plane may go down but you know I'm okay  with that I'm okay with dying like
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3166490,3174230,that's because now it's like I'm doing I  know I'm doing everything I possibly can  every single day to inspire impact the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3174230,3179270,people around me and if I die I know  that I've done my part as much as I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3179270,3188510,possibly can  that's that's the driving force of like  everyday like pushing myself and that's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3188510,3195520,when I was like I want to step up as it  was more as a more as a role model for  this generation and be a better leader
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3195520,3201830,let me tell you happen let me tell you  if I was able to do it you can too  you know and that you need to start
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3201830,3207830,making that choice you need to make that  choice right now for yourself figure out  their their you know their why man it
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3207830,3214190,really comes down to that but you know  that's the truth it's figuring out what  really why are they doing it what really
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3214190,3220520,truly drives them to move solve this  problem it's definitely it's definitely
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3220520,3226400,tough for them and the entrepreneurs  have to definitely have their lows a lot
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3226400,3233930,of some who don't make it you know some  of them break and there's like Isis it  for me and can anyone become a great
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3233930,3241250,entrepreneur yes do that do they have  what it takes  are they willing to do whatever it takes  a lot of people
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3241250,3247910,give up that's just it you know that's  just the truth and you have to be
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3247910,3255440,resourceful you have to be willing to  get your hands dirty and do a little bit  of everything in the beginning but then  it's like okay really buckle down and I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3255440,3261800,figure out what am I really really  passionate about what am i really great  at was that one thing that I can do the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3261800,3269660,very best on my team to add the most  value figuring out okay who do you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3269660,3279380,really need you know who are the people  that you need you know around you and  what are you really truly great at it's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3279380,3285740,extremely important today that you  understand how to share your story how  to document the process how to put that  out how are people discovering you in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3285740,3291050,today's day and age consistently day in  and day out you need to surround  yourself with the right energy the right
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3291050,3299030,people like that as passionate of you  like-minded people that positivity and  that Energy's infectious like we live in
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3299030,3305810,this day and age or like social media is  so strong right you know and you can do  so many great things in connect but like
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3305810,3312589,really digging into like what why you  know why are you here what are you like
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3312589,3318470,what do you want to give to the world  you know and are you really discovering
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3318470,3324770,that within yourself because there's so  much consumption happening on a daily  basis because of social me and  everything you didn't get so caught up
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3324770,3331430,on like living a script of what you  think you should be doing we're having  digging down inside yourself and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3331430,3336740,shutting off all the noise and like  figuring out like what is it that you  you know what is it that you really want
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3336740,3342470,to do and what is it that you want to  give to the world and I think that  Mellon is right now a lot of them you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3342470,3348109,know haven't figured out who they really  are and like because of the and and then
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3348109,3353900,and then their fear they feared they  fear how people are going to judge them  and what they look like and all that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3353900,3360529,stuff instead of like really figuring  out who they really are  not trying to be something that they're  not and and then started living a true
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3360529,3366710,authentic life and putting that out I'm  not afraid to fail you know for me
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3366710,3373309,there's nothing more powerful than  creating something and if it's going  wrong like solving okay how about let's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3373309,3381140,pivot let's just figure out why it's not  working and continuing until you know we  actually built something that people you
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3381140,3387140,know see value in believe in something  hold heartily and follow that with faith
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3387140,3395029,and courage to just go and no matter  what to be able to you also I think for
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3395029,3403450,me leading is picking up the people  around me and putting them before myself
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3403450,3409579,caring about everybody around me and  putting them in a position to thrive and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3409579,3414740,this to see before myself and basically  leading by example of how you live your
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3414740,3423319,life leadership to me as a character you  know who you are not what you do when
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3423319,3428450,you make a decision you can't just walk  away from the decision and say it's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3428450,3433489,somebody else's problem the ability to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3433489,3440239,embrace failure is a bit for me it's a  strength I think and but I but I I'm not
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3440239,3446869,a quitter  and so if you have the two you're not  afraid to fail and but you don't quit  when you fail I think that's a pretty
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3446869,3452630,decent combination I think it's
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3452630,3459300,important  to avoid that pitfall you have to  surround yourself with people who
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3459300,3468340,approach things differently who  challenge you we we know that we have
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3468340,3474190,the ability to change the world we know  that we've already taken steps in that
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3474190,3480700,direction if we don't follow it to the  end game people like you and me will
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3480700,3487270,wind up feeling totally unfulfilled and  frustrated you break it down to the to
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3487270,3493480,the problem identify the root cause and  then you try and engineer a solution to  the root cause of the problem you take a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3493480,3500290,series of steps so that that failure  isn't a fatal failure if I can identify
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3500290,3505540,a problem early on and then if I have if  I have help getting to the root cause I
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3505540,3511330,can address the root cause problem with  one step or another to make that no
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3511330,3517090,longer a lethal problem but the the fact
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3517090,3523030,is that if you're good enough to see an  impending failure and address it it's a
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3523030,3530380,hell of a lot cheaper and it's a hell of  a lot easier and you get to sleep a lot  earlier if you can do it before it goes
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3530380,3537250,completely haywire what's the solution  the problems identified focus on the
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3537250,3543970,solution and come up with it with a  series of options leadership is about
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3543970,3550930,vision and responsibility it's not all  about power so you want to be a leader
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3550930,3556349,you want to take control then I'll tell  you what use your vision
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3556349,3561599,use your vision to take control of your  life and change your perspective on life
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3561599,3568950,and change your perspective on what  power means to you because leadership is  so much more than just a 40 and power
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3568950,3574430,you gotta take action for the better and  not just be selfish for your own means
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3574430,3579599,to be a leader you have to take  responsibility not just when you make
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3579599,3585420,mistakes but then also to embrace them  afterwards  to make them and take control of them
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3585420,3592410,and then even make them part of your  leadership you got to do this in order  to live honestly and free from fear of
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3592410,3599190,others approval be the leader of your  own life first go ahead and write out  the instructions for your own life and
q3ZjCW8UT5g,3599190,3606660,use them to take your journey to step on  the right path the right path towards  success because with that success you're
