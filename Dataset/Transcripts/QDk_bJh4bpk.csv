QDk_bJh4bpk,14880,16960,what's up guys it's carl and this is one
QDk_bJh4bpk,16960,19039,of my favorite videos to do every single
QDk_bJh4bpk,19039,21279,year as i mentioned it's a tour of where
QDk_bJh4bpk,21279,23519,we're currently living and before we get
QDk_bJh4bpk,23519,25279,started quick little house update if
QDk_bJh4bpk,25279,26640,this is the first time you're watching
QDk_bJh4bpk,26640,28560,any of this content we are building a
QDk_bJh4bpk,28560,31199,house which we should be moving into
QDk_bJh4bpk,31199,33680,next year if all goes well we are based
QDk_bJh4bpk,33680,35840,here in toronto the house is in toronto
QDk_bJh4bpk,35840,37600,and since that video i haven't really
QDk_bJh4bpk,37600,40239,updated you guys too much um quick
QDk_bJh4bpk,40239,42160,update so in that vid we talked about
QDk_bJh4bpk,42160,44160,the house it's my parents house it's the
QDk_bJh4bpk,44160,45920,house that i grew up in they're moving
QDk_bJh4bpk,45920,47920,to a condo which was actually my
QDk_bJh4bpk,47920,49760,previous studio before i moved here
QDk_bJh4bpk,49760,51440,we've been renting that out for the past
QDk_bJh4bpk,51440,53440,four years we talked about the design
QDk_bJh4bpk,53440,56719,the blueprints a lot has happened and uh
QDk_bJh4bpk,56719,58719,yeah lots of paintings lots of different
QDk_bJh4bpk,58719,61199,drawings the past couple months has all
QDk_bJh4bpk,61199,63280,been around um some of the fun stuff
QDk_bJh4bpk,63280,64799,picking color palettes which i think is
QDk_bJh4bpk,64799,66400,most people's favorite and maybe some of
QDk_bJh4bpk,66400,68799,the not so interesting things budget so
QDk_bJh4bpk,68799,71200,we'll start off with the nasty stuff
QDk_bJh4bpk,71200,73200,first so budget i'll kind of go through
QDk_bJh4bpk,73200,75680,my list i'll try to be as transparent as
QDk_bJh4bpk,75680,78000,i can on a project like this no matter
QDk_bJh4bpk,78000,80000,what scale you're given an itemized line
QDk_bJh4bpk,80000,82400,list of the budget what each finish will
QDk_bJh4bpk,82400,84640,cost what each room will cost the actual
QDk_bJh4bpk,84640,86799,labor costs and at the very bottom you
QDk_bJh4bpk,86799,88799,see your overall budget and your
QDk_bJh4bpk,88799,91200,contractor your architect will say hey
QDk_bJh4bpk,91200,92960,we can work within these parameters what
QDk_bJh4bpk,92960,94799,you've initially designed makes sense
QDk_bJh4bpk,94799,96720,where it doesn't make sense and as an
QDk_bJh4bpk,96720,99040,example windows which i think everyone
QDk_bJh4bpk,99040,100479,loves they're super modern you want to
QDk_bJh4bpk,100479,102720,have giant windows everywhere they are
QDk_bJh4bpk,102720,105040,the most expensive thing or one of the
QDk_bJh4bpk,105040,108079,most expensive things on my budget line
QDk_bJh4bpk,108079,111759,and it just wasn't as realistic so what
QDk_bJh4bpk,111759,113759,has to be done unless you all have
QDk_bJh4bpk,113759,116000,unlimited budget which would be nice you
QDk_bJh4bpk,116000,117600,go back to the drawings and you actually
QDk_bJh4bpk,117600,120079,make modifications do all these windows
QDk_bJh4bpk,120079,122240,make sense do i need floor to ceiling
QDk_bJh4bpk,122240,124640,windows in every single room probably
QDk_bJh4bpk,124640,127280,not that's where you'll kind of make
QDk_bJh4bpk,127280,130399,adjustments and revisions to the design
QDk_bJh4bpk,130399,133840,to reflect to fit into your budget but
QDk_bJh4bpk,133840,135440,um anyways i won't bore you with budget
QDk_bJh4bpk,135440,137360,talk that's where we're kind of sitting
QDk_bJh4bpk,137360,139280,shovels should be going into the ground
QDk_bJh4bpk,139280,141440,for the entire construction demolition
QDk_bJh4bpk,141440,143040,piece should be happening in the next
QDk_bJh4bpk,143040,144720,couple weeks so it's super exciting i
QDk_bJh4bpk,144720,146160,kind of want to talk about finishes
QDk_bJh4bpk,146160,147840,because i think a lot of you are into
QDk_bJh4bpk,147840,149120,this kind of stuff and it's more of the
QDk_bJh4bpk,149120,151200,aesthetic part which i think more people
QDk_bJh4bpk,151200,154160,are drawn to so over here i kind of have
QDk_bJh4bpk,154160,156720,an idea board of some of the potential
QDk_bJh4bpk,156720,158720,finish options that we're gonna go for
QDk_bJh4bpk,158720,161680,so our color palette kind of consists of
QDk_bJh4bpk,161680,164000,the following we have this floor option
QDk_bJh4bpk,164000,165680,so i think we're leaning towards this
QDk_bJh4bpk,165680,167760,white oak with this oil wash finish that
QDk_bJh4bpk,167760,170640,has hints of gray because our second
QDk_bJh4bpk,170640,173040,color option in the palette and material
QDk_bJh4bpk,173040,175040,is concrete so this is from a company
QDk_bJh4bpk,175040,177680,called deco once again from canada so
QDk_bJh4bpk,177680,179120,really cool i know that concrete is
QDk_bJh4bpk,179120,180959,really modern right now we're also
QDk_bJh4bpk,180959,182640,leaning towards white cabinets in our
QDk_bJh4bpk,182640,184640,kitchen no see cabinetry we're trying to
QDk_bJh4bpk,184640,186480,work with them and for some of these
QDk_bJh4bpk,186480,188879,stone finishes these are both from
QDk_bJh4bpk,188879,190959,handstone so our options in the kitchen
QDk_bJh4bpk,190959,193519,and other areas they are this calcutta
QDk_bJh4bpk,193519,195840,so that's the white marbling with some
QDk_bJh4bpk,195840,198080,of the nice gray veining so that should
QDk_bJh4bpk,198080,200000,tie into the concrete and into the floor
QDk_bJh4bpk,200000,202720,we do have some little pallets from rove
QDk_bJh4bpk,202720,204319,concepts who we've worked with forever
QDk_bJh4bpk,204319,206000,so they'll be supplying some of our
QDk_bJh4bpk,206000,208560,furniture that's in a light taupe which
QDk_bJh4bpk,208560,210640,kind of ties into this entire neutral
QDk_bJh4bpk,210640,214400,palette and i decided to throw in my s22
QDk_bJh4bpk,214400,216319,ultra in here because matte black will
QDk_bJh4bpk,216319,218640,be the option for our windows which
QDk_bJh4bpk,218640,220720,we're shopping for and also for a lot of
QDk_bJh4bpk,220720,223120,our hardware not only in the kitchen but
QDk_bJh4bpk,223120,224799,in our washrooms as well we're actually
QDk_bJh4bpk,224799,226879,partnering up with kohler a lot of their
QDk_bJh4bpk,226879,228720,modern lines do come in matte black and
QDk_bJh4bpk,228720,230799,since i didn't have any of the final
QDk_bJh4bpk,230799,234159,hardware taps i threw in my s22 ultra
QDk_bJh4bpk,234159,235680,into my color board thought that was
QDk_bJh4bpk,235680,237760,kind of funny but i'll leave some b-roll
QDk_bJh4bpk,237760,240159,of this let me know what you guys think
QDk_bJh4bpk,240159,242400,i've been spending hours over on
QDk_bJh4bpk,242400,245280,sketchup agonizing over what this would
QDk_bJh4bpk,245280,247200,look like i'm trying to project that
QDk_bJh4bpk,247200,249280,into my brain to see the final finish
QDk_bJh4bpk,249280,251280,but uh i think we're pretty happy with
QDk_bJh4bpk,251280,253519,these choices they're all fairly neutral
QDk_bJh4bpk,253519,256160,but anyways that is where we are sitting
QDk_bJh4bpk,256160,259040,at um our new house we'll get back to
QDk_bJh4bpk,259040,260320,this video that was kind of a little
QDk_bJh4bpk,260320,262560,rant at the beginning
QDk_bJh4bpk,262560,264960,here we are
QDk_bJh4bpk,264960,266240,so if this is the first time you're
QDk_bJh4bpk,266240,268320,watching one of my vids or you've been
QDk_bJh4bpk,268320,270080,tuned in for the last little while we
QDk_bJh4bpk,270080,271919,have been in this spot for four years
QDk_bJh4bpk,271919,274560,approaching five time is just kind of
QDk_bJh4bpk,274560,277040,flying by us and this is in the city
QDk_bJh4bpk,277040,280800,we're around 1650 700 square feet which
QDk_bJh4bpk,280800,283360,is a really decent size for a condo in
QDk_bJh4bpk,283360,286000,toronto and the blue plant the blue
QDk_bJh4bpk,286000,288080,plant the blueprint
QDk_bJh4bpk,288080,290560,of this floor is pretty decent dining
QDk_bJh4bpk,290560,292880,area over here and kitchen on this side
QDk_bJh4bpk,292880,295040,we'll start off with actually the living
QDk_bJh4bpk,295040,297440,room it's where i guess most of the tech
QDk_bJh4bpk,297440,299280,is let's do a little switch and you'll
QDk_bJh4bpk,299280,300160,face
QDk_bJh4bpk,300160,301840,this way that's actually a great little
QDk_bJh4bpk,301840,303440,segue into one of our sponsors for this
QDk_bJh4bpk,303440,305919,episode which is the anchor yuffie so
QDk_bJh4bpk,305919,307680,since we've had link having a dog in
QDk_bJh4bpk,307680,309360,general anyone that knows that they
QDk_bJh4bpk,309360,311360,bring in so much debris so much dirt
QDk_bJh4bpk,311360,313440,from walks into the place so this guy
QDk_bJh4bpk,313440,315280,specifically helps pick up dirt and
QDk_bJh4bpk,315280,317440,debris especially in harder to reach
QDk_bJh4bpk,317440,319440,areas that a traditional vacuum can't
QDk_bJh4bpk,319440,322479,reach like a couch and it does actually
QDk_bJh4bpk,322479,324400,have double the suction power of other
QDk_bJh4bpk,324400,325759,products in the market it's got a
QDk_bJh4bpk,325759,328400,hundred thousand rpm high speed motor
QDk_bJh4bpk,328400,330000,and even for things that are really hard
QDk_bJh4bpk,330000,332000,or tough to pick up you can activate max
QDk_bJh4bpk,332000,335039,mode which utilizes all 80 aw of strong
QDk_bJh4bpk,335039,336400,suction power
QDk_bJh4bpk,336400,338160,this little guy goes into nooks and
QDk_bJh4bpk,338160,339680,crevices and what's great we actually
QDk_bJh4bpk,339680,341520,have this little mounting area with the
QDk_bJh4bpk,341520,343840,stand where it charges right behind the
QDk_bJh4bpk,343840,346080,couch so it's easy to access
QDk_bJh4bpk,346080,347759,and that battery life is actually more
QDk_bJh4bpk,347759,349600,than double compared to other products
QDk_bJh4bpk,349600,351840,in the market and the 2500 milliamp hour
QDk_bJh4bpk,351840,353680,cell is a high rate discharge cell
QDk_bJh4bpk,353680,355680,combine that with anker's multi-protect
QDk_bJh4bpk,355680,358319,system ensures a safe battery life
QDk_bJh4bpk,358319,359840,battery life you're looking at around 20
QDk_bJh4bpk,359840,361120,minutes per charge and you can see how
QDk_bJh4bpk,361120,363759,the battery kind of slots into the back
QDk_bJh4bpk,363759,365280,and that's actually really good for a
QDk_bJh4bpk,365280,367759,device this light and this compact it's
QDk_bJh4bpk,367759,369680,about the same weight as a water bottle
QDk_bJh4bpk,369680,371840,it's 1.78 pounds so you can just use it
QDk_bJh4bpk,371840,373759,with one hand and it comes with a bunch
QDk_bJh4bpk,373759,375840,of different attachment heads for
QDk_bJh4bpk,375840,378880,different purposes it's got a 250 ml
QDk_bJh4bpk,378880,380800,dust box and i find that i have to empty
QDk_bJh4bpk,380800,382880,that out maybe once a week and the
QDk_bJh4bpk,382880,385280,components like the filter are washable
QDk_bJh4bpk,385280,386479,so you can always just run that
QDk_bJh4bpk,386479,388639,underwater to clean it out stick it in
QDk_bJh4bpk,388639,390479,the little drying rack and once it's dry
QDk_bJh4bpk,390479,392319,you can pop it back into place and then
QDk_bJh4bpk,392319,394400,it's ready to go for the next charge
QDk_bJh4bpk,394400,395759,it's kind of one of those little pieces
QDk_bJh4bpk,395759,396880,of tech that you don't know you're
QDk_bJh4bpk,396880,398479,missing out on until you've started
QDk_bJh4bpk,398479,400560,using it i can't well i guess i can
QDk_bJh4bpk,400560,402479,imagine my life without it but uh since
QDk_bJh4bpk,402479,404240,we've had link since i've been using
QDk_bJh4bpk,404240,406080,this guy it's just been super handy so
QDk_bJh4bpk,406080,407280,if you're interested check out the
QDk_bJh4bpk,407280,409680,yuffie handheld vacuum the home vac h30
QDk_bJh4bpk,409680,411520,on ufe's amazon store to purchase your
QDk_bJh4bpk,411520,413759,own so the tv room living room is
QDk_bJh4bpk,413759,415440,probably the area that most people spend
QDk_bJh4bpk,415440,416880,the majority of their time in their
QDk_bJh4bpk,416880,419520,place this area is no different maybe i
QDk_bJh4bpk,419520,422240,sleep the most in my bedroom i spend the
QDk_bJh4bpk,422240,423919,most amount of time sleeping in my place
QDk_bJh4bpk,423919,426319,but anyways this is the area where we
QDk_bJh4bpk,426319,428639,watch tv you can see behind me 100
QDk_bJh4bpk,428639,430960,inches and if you've watched any of my
QDk_bJh4bpk,430960,433039,content before i always go back and
QDk_bJh4bpk,433039,435039,forth am i going to stick with the 100
QDk_bJh4bpk,435039,437280,inch laser tv am i going to switch back
QDk_bJh4bpk,437280,439680,to something like an lg oled just
QDk_bJh4bpk,439680,442000,because the picture quality is better i
QDk_bJh4bpk,442000,444560,always go back to the larger size so
QDk_bJh4bpk,444560,447680,this 100 inch monitor link maybe agrees
QDk_bJh4bpk,447680,449520,is where we watch all of our content it
QDk_bJh4bpk,449520,452720,is the 100 inch high sense 4k laser tv
QDk_bJh4bpk,452720,455520,so the actual tv lives close to the wall
QDk_bJh4bpk,455520,457440,it's called a short throw projection
QDk_bJh4bpk,457440,459680,laser tv the image actually just goes
QDk_bJh4bpk,459680,463280,straight up i will not lie it isn't as
QDk_bJh4bpk,463280,465199,bright it isn't as vibrant on a sunny
QDk_bJh4bpk,465199,467039,day like this the picture quality isn't
QDk_bJh4bpk,467039,469360,as good but i am willing to sacrifice
QDk_bJh4bpk,469360,470720,that for
QDk_bJh4bpk,470720,473199,the size the 100 inches is just super
QDk_bJh4bpk,473199,475840,super nice and if i decide to keep this
QDk_bJh4bpk,475840,478639,place rented out i think i will keep it
QDk_bJh4bpk,478639,480960,with this 100 inch tv for the next
QDk_bJh4bpk,480960,483840,person to enjoy it is i think a selling
QDk_bJh4bpk,483840,485680,point of this place now and i'm not
QDk_bJh4bpk,485680,487120,saying that this picture quality is bad
QDk_bJh4bpk,487120,488720,in any way it's just the time that we
QDk_bJh4bpk,488720,491039,watch most of our tv is at night when we
QDk_bJh4bpk,491039,492960,get home from work the last thing that
QDk_bJh4bpk,492960,495440,we want to do oh link is moving off is
QDk_bJh4bpk,495440,497039,to um
QDk_bJh4bpk,497039,498560,i guess the only thing we want to do
QDk_bJh4bpk,498560,500479,sometimes after working eight nine 10
QDk_bJh4bpk,500479,502560,hour days is just to watch a bit of
QDk_bJh4bpk,502560,504240,content whether that's netflix whether
QDk_bJh4bpk,504240,506720,it's a new movie when we say eat some
QDk_bJh4bpk,506720,508800,dinner we kind of spend our time on this
QDk_bJh4bpk,508800,510160,l-shaped couch and just having the
QDk_bJh4bpk,510160,511759,larger sizes better i'll go back and
QDk_bJh4bpk,511759,513360,forth on it probably till the day that i
QDk_bJh4bpk,513360,515518,move away from this place i'll test out
QDk_bJh4bpk,515518,517200,multiple tvs but
QDk_bJh4bpk,517200,518800,i always go back
QDk_bJh4bpk,518800,521279,to the big guy this l-shaped couch and
QDk_bJh4bpk,521279,523599,actually most of this furniture has been
QDk_bJh4bpk,523599,525680,with me since i initially moved in four
QDk_bJh4bpk,525680,527440,and a half five years ago it's from a
QDk_bJh4bpk,527440,529680,company called calgaris more expensive
QDk_bJh4bpk,529680,532640,than ikea stuff but it's held the test
QDk_bJh4bpk,532640,535040,i will say for the couch just because we
QDk_bJh4bpk,535040,536800,ended up getting a dog the leather has
QDk_bJh4bpk,536800,538720,been scratched a bit by link it's
QDk_bJh4bpk,538720,539920,something that
QDk_bJh4bpk,539920,541839,i initially didn't want him on the couch
QDk_bJh4bpk,541839,543920,when we first got him but his favorite
QDk_bJh4bpk,543920,544800,place
QDk_bJh4bpk,544800,546800,has now been that far side of the couch
QDk_bJh4bpk,546800,548399,where he always sleeps so i did put a
QDk_bJh4bpk,548399,550720,little blanket a little throw just to
QDk_bJh4bpk,550720,552640,keep it a bit protected but
QDk_bJh4bpk,552640,555360,that's his new little throne area i have
QDk_bJh4bpk,555360,559399,to move this camp to show you guys
QDk_bJh4bpk,562000,563920,link
QDk_bJh4bpk,563920,566320,the rest of the tech in the living room
QDk_bJh4bpk,566320,568640,so i mentioned the tv consoles running
QDk_bJh4bpk,568640,571920,off it we have the xbox series s it's
QDk_bJh4bpk,571920,573600,been a great little console not only for
QDk_bJh4bpk,573600,575200,the price factor it's the one that i
QDk_bJh4bpk,575200,577200,usually recommend and especially because
QDk_bJh4bpk,577200,579600,our tv can't handle a higher refresh
QDk_bJh4bpk,579600,582399,rate i dabble in gaming now sadly i
QDk_bJh4bpk,582399,583920,don't game as much as i used to but
QDk_bJh4bpk,583920,585760,maybe the occasional war zone game i
QDk_bJh4bpk,585760,587519,think halo infinite was the last game
QDk_bJh4bpk,587519,589120,that i fully completed and just because
QDk_bJh4bpk,589120,591040,we're at home
QDk_bJh4bpk,591040,593040,gotta show this to you guys one of the
QDk_bJh4bpk,593040,595519,coolest pr gift boxes that i got a
QDk_bJh4bpk,595519,597920,little master chief
QDk_bJh4bpk,597920,601360,helmet uh so this lives in our second
QDk_bJh4bpk,601360,603600,bedroom which you'll see in a second has
QDk_bJh4bpk,603600,605839,just become storage but um
QDk_bJh4bpk,605839,608160,huge halo fan huge
QDk_bJh4bpk,608160,609839,memories playing
QDk_bJh4bpk,609839,612240,the og halo and even halo 2 with my
QDk_bJh4bpk,612240,614399,friends growing up so i am a big xbox
QDk_bJh4bpk,614399,616480,fan that is the console of choice and
QDk_bJh4bpk,616480,618800,the last piece of tech tied to the tv is
QDk_bJh4bpk,618800,622560,the soundbar i think it's the sn11 by lg
QDk_bJh4bpk,622560,624800,it's a surround sound speaker option it
QDk_bJh4bpk,624800,627200,gives you two surround sound speakers
QDk_bJh4bpk,627200,629440,that are wireless which is super handy
QDk_bJh4bpk,629440,631200,usually with surround sound you need to
QDk_bJh4bpk,631200,632720,have the wires going back to the main
QDk_bJh4bpk,632720,634399,system so i actually have them living
QDk_bJh4bpk,634399,636240,off to the side just on the right and
QDk_bJh4bpk,636240,639279,one to the left of link actually looking
QDk_bJh4bpk,639279,641440,that way we have i guess it's a piece of
QDk_bJh4bpk,641440,643519,tech it's a dyson lamp it's one of their
QDk_bJh4bpk,643519,646720,new morph form lights it looks cool it's
QDk_bJh4bpk,646720,648959,dope the leds mimic natural daylight so
QDk_bJh4bpk,648959,650640,they actually change in color depending
QDk_bJh4bpk,650640,652160,what time of the day it is and it's
QDk_bJh4bpk,652160,654079,slated to last an entire lifetime that
QDk_bJh4bpk,654079,656000,light will probably live longer than me
QDk_bJh4bpk,656000,658880,i just wouldn't spend um over a thousand
QDk_bJh4bpk,658880,662000,dollars on a floor light but thanks to
QDk_bJh4bpk,662000,664240,dyson over on this side we just have
QDk_bJh4bpk,664240,666160,this little console table where we drop
QDk_bJh4bpk,666160,668560,our keys at the beginning slash end of
QDk_bJh4bpk,668560,670320,the day we just have little air tags on
QDk_bJh4bpk,670320,672560,them to keep track of them a little
QDk_bJh4bpk,672560,674959,clock which is the google nest hub we
QDk_bJh4bpk,674959,676880,asked google something sometimes but i
QDk_bJh4bpk,676880,679440,find this clock has been or i guess
QDk_bJh4bpk,679440,681360,google has just been wonky
QDk_bJh4bpk,681360,683519,hey google when does manchester united
QDk_bJh4bpk,683519,686399,play again manchester united fcs next
QDk_bJh4bpk,686399,689600,game is on saturday at 12 30 p.m okay so
QDk_bJh4bpk,689600,691839,that works but um i find that google
QDk_bJh4bpk,691839,693839,assistant has just been wonky maybe that
QDk_bJh4bpk,693839,696079,thing needs a software update but i
QDk_bJh4bpk,696079,696959,think
QDk_bJh4bpk,696959,698160,that
QDk_bJh4bpk,698160,700240,right link is all of the tech
QDk_bJh4bpk,700240,702399,in uh the living room area kind of
QDk_bJh4bpk,702399,705279,looking around i think that is it on the
QDk_bJh4bpk,705279,707600,coffee table we just usually have our tv
QDk_bJh4bpk,707600,710079,controllers the xbox controller and
QDk_bJh4bpk,710079,711760,maybe some books i'm into architect
QDk_bJh4bpk,711760,713440,books as you saw at the beginning of the
QDk_bJh4bpk,713440,715279,video planning out that house just
QDk_bJh4bpk,715279,718160,trying to get inspo ideas and
QDk_bJh4bpk,718160,719360,lego
QDk_bJh4bpk,719360,720800,always have to have bits of lego we've
QDk_bJh4bpk,720800,722480,got the good old tie fighter behind me
QDk_bJh4bpk,722480,724160,and that is
QDk_bJh4bpk,724160,726560,the tv area let's do
QDk_bJh4bpk,726560,728560,swap
QDk_bJh4bpk,728560,730720,okay so facing back from the tv slash
QDk_bJh4bpk,730720,733200,living room into the dining room where
QDk_bJh4bpk,733200,735279,we started off the vid this is where we
QDk_bJh4bpk,735279,738800,eat most of our meals this table when i
QDk_bJh4bpk,738800,740560,initially got it i spent
QDk_bJh4bpk,740560,741600,i think
QDk_bJh4bpk,741600,743440,i can't even remember so much money i
QDk_bJh4bpk,743440,745120,remember saying to myself this table
QDk_bJh4bpk,745120,746720,looks so cool i'll never find anything
QDk_bJh4bpk,746720,748959,as cool as this i still stand by it i
QDk_bJh4bpk,748959,752079,think it's the centerpiece furniture of
QDk_bJh4bpk,752079,756560,uh this place i got this from
QDk_bJh4bpk,757279,759600,calgaris where a lot of other furniture
QDk_bJh4bpk,759600,761920,is from but uh for being five years old
QDk_bJh4bpk,761920,763839,it's held up actually perfectly so it's
QDk_bJh4bpk,763839,766480,actually a ceramic top this marble
QDk_bJh4bpk,766480,768560,finish is actually printed on this but
QDk_bJh4bpk,768560,770880,the benefits of ceramic they are super
QDk_bJh4bpk,770880,772959,easy to keep clean it never scratches it
QDk_bJh4bpk,772959,775680,never stains and these legs are super
QDk_bJh4bpk,775680,777680,badass i don't think i've seen a table
QDk_bJh4bpk,777680,780000,as cool as this i'll stop talking about
QDk_bJh4bpk,780000,783040,tables behind me my badass banana tree
QDk_bJh4bpk,783040,784800,plant and if you've watched videos over
QDk_bJh4bpk,784800,786560,the past couple years you've probably
QDk_bJh4bpk,786560,788160,seen this thing grow because when i
QDk_bJh4bpk,788160,789600,initially moved in i got this as a
QDk_bJh4bpk,789600,791680,housewarming gift from my mom it was a
QDk_bJh4bpk,791680,794480,little seedling it only had one stock so
QDk_bJh4bpk,794480,797200,over five years i have somehow managed
QDk_bJh4bpk,797200,799360,to keep it alive it's um
QDk_bJh4bpk,799360,801120,my baby it's
QDk_bJh4bpk,801120,803200,being here as long as i have i guess
QDk_bJh4bpk,803200,804880,part of the plant we actually just have
QDk_bJh4bpk,804880,808079,link's little uh crate which he has
QDk_bJh4bpk,808079,809200,collected
QDk_bJh4bpk,809200,811440,a lot of his toys a lot of his food sits
QDk_bJh4bpk,811440,813600,here this was actually a really cool box
QDk_bJh4bpk,813600,816000,from zoa which is an energy drink that
QDk_bJh4bpk,816000,817839,the rock made they did this little
QDk_bJh4bpk,817839,820000,collab with microsoft and they came out
QDk_bJh4bpk,820000,822000,with this limited edition controller
QDk_bJh4bpk,822000,823839,with a console so i thought that was a
QDk_bJh4bpk,823839,826160,cool little collab link's food lives in
QDk_bJh4bpk,826160,828560,there behind the tree going that way is
QDk_bJh4bpk,828560,831279,a little console which does house some
QDk_bJh4bpk,831279,834160,tech but more importantly one of my
QDk_bJh4bpk,834160,837120,latest lego builds old trafford i'm a
QDk_bJh4bpk,837120,839279,big red devils fan a big man united fan
QDk_bJh4bpk,839279,841440,i grew up watching
QDk_bJh4bpk,841440,843839,beckham giggs the neville brothers
QDk_bJh4bpk,843839,846000,skulls that was the team that i grew up
QDk_bJh4bpk,846000,848000,watching in the 90s so i know that we're
QDk_bJh4bpk,848000,850720,not doing the best right now i'm hoping
QDk_bJh4bpk,850720,853680,we snag a champions league spot but
QDk_bJh4bpk,853680,855760,that's my football team of choice on top
QDk_bJh4bpk,855760,858480,of that we do have some tech in the form
QDk_bJh4bpk,858480,860959,of a samsung frame tv once again i've
QDk_bJh4bpk,860959,863680,had that close to three four years
QDk_bJh4bpk,863680,865519,no need to replace it it's great because
QDk_bJh4bpk,865519,867839,it just has artwork displaying i do find
QDk_bJh4bpk,867839,870480,tvs really ugly when they're off i find
QDk_bJh4bpk,870480,873360,them to be these really ugly black holes
QDk_bJh4bpk,873360,875519,and at least with frame tvs you can have
QDk_bJh4bpk,875519,877680,some form of art playing on it speaker
QDk_bJh4bpk,877680,880560,wise i am rocking two apple home pods
QDk_bJh4bpk,880560,882399,and those are a bit of relics now
QDk_bJh4bpk,882399,884240,because they'll no longer be updated
QDk_bJh4bpk,884240,886000,even though we did get the new homepod
QDk_bJh4bpk,886000,889040,minis i don't think they actually still
QDk_bJh4bpk,889040,890000,sell
QDk_bJh4bpk,890000,892399,homepods or the og homepods so i think
QDk_bJh4bpk,892399,894240,those will be running until uh the
QDk_bJh4bpk,894240,897120,latest ios update renders them useless
QDk_bJh4bpk,897120,898320,so they're just kind of living on the
QDk_bJh4bpk,898320,900399,side they're decent they're not the best
QDk_bJh4bpk,900399,902959,siri is still the worst smart assistant
QDk_bJh4bpk,902959,904800,out of the three and the last piece of i
QDk_bJh4bpk,904800,906399,guess smart tech even though it's once
QDk_bJh4bpk,906399,909600,again a bit dated is the og the gen 1
QDk_bJh4bpk,909600,912000,nest google thermostat it's been decent
QDk_bJh4bpk,912000,913920,nothing really to report and now that
QDk_bJh4bpk,913920,916639,the weather is getting better in toronto
QDk_bJh4bpk,916639,919279,okay google what's the weather right now
QDk_bJh4bpk,919279,921839,in toronto right now in toronto it's
QDk_bJh4bpk,921839,924720,minus six degrees and mostly cloudy
QDk_bJh4bpk,924720,926959,today there'll be scattered snow showers
QDk_bJh4bpk,926959,929440,with a forecasted high of -5 and a low
QDk_bJh4bpk,929440,932320,of -7 kitchen area not too much in terms
QDk_bJh4bpk,932320,933759,of tech but i thought i'd share it with
QDk_bJh4bpk,933759,935920,you guys anyways this island over here
QDk_bJh4bpk,935920,939279,used to be a dark brown i redid the
QDk_bJh4bpk,939279,941600,paneling to have a bit of a lighter wood
QDk_bJh4bpk,941600,943279,something that i did add though if you
QDk_bJh4bpk,943279,945040,are someone that works at home or likes
QDk_bJh4bpk,945040,947440,to work at your island get
QDk_bJh4bpk,947440,949440,outlets they are something that i added
QDk_bJh4bpk,949440,950959,they're a lifesaver so they do charge
QDk_bJh4bpk,950959,952720,usually my laptop my macbook pro right
QDk_bJh4bpk,952720,954560,now is getting juice from it you can see
QDk_bJh4bpk,954560,956079,the second outlet there which is covered
QDk_bJh4bpk,956079,957759,by my barstool usually my iphone or
QDk_bJh4bpk,957759,960160,repair airpods chills there we do have
QDk_bJh4bpk,960160,962000,just other little bits of memorabilia
QDk_bJh4bpk,962000,964399,the uv arrow with toronto a mount
QDk_bJh4bpk,964399,966320,taunton which is the place that we have
QDk_bJh4bpk,966320,967600,in the south of france which is always
QDk_bJh4bpk,967600,969440,nice to go to so yeah that's kind of the
QDk_bJh4bpk,969440,971279,kitchen and some of our future new
QDk_bJh4bpk,971279,972720,hardware like i said we're working with
QDk_bJh4bpk,972720,974560,kohler the tops that we're going to be
QDk_bJh4bpk,974560,976480,using will be smart taps so you can
QDk_bJh4bpk,976480,978160,actually stick your hand in front of it
QDk_bJh4bpk,978160,979680,the sensor will go off and the water
QDk_bJh4bpk,979680,981040,will start going so you don't have to
QDk_bJh4bpk,981040,983519,get any of your hardware messy when you
QDk_bJh4bpk,983519,984959,are cooking it does make a bit of a
QDk_bJh4bpk,984959,987680,difference and something that um i kind
QDk_bJh4bpk,987680,989759,of love link's little treat bowl is off
QDk_bJh4bpk,989759,991680,to the side that will come with us to
QDk_bJh4bpk,991680,993040,the new place
QDk_bJh4bpk,993040,993839,that
QDk_bJh4bpk,993839,997360,is our kitchen okay so moving from the
QDk_bJh4bpk,997360,1000399,living room area into the main bedroom
QDk_bJh4bpk,1000399,1003759,this is where the real madrid happens uh
QDk_bJh4bpk,1003759,1006639,this actually used to be my old studio i
QDk_bJh4bpk,1006639,1009279,was in here for two maybe even three
QDk_bJh4bpk,1009279,1011440,years before i have the studio which i
QDk_bJh4bpk,1011440,1013680,think a lot of you know right now and i
QDk_bJh4bpk,1013680,1015600,used to sleep in the second bedroom
QDk_bJh4bpk,1015600,1017440,which i think will be the last spot of
QDk_bJh4bpk,1017440,1020560,this little condo tour but um this is
QDk_bJh4bpk,1020560,1022240,the main bedroom you can actually see we
QDk_bJh4bpk,1022240,1024558,have a legit bed right now hints of
QDk_bJh4bpk,1024558,1026558,orange you guys always flake me for not
QDk_bJh4bpk,1026558,1029038,having any orange there is this orange
QDk_bJh4bpk,1029038,1031678,throw on the bed i actually got this at
QDk_bJh4bpk,1031678,1034798,an apple event from the soho new york
QDk_bJh4bpk,1034798,1037280,hotel i snagged it i
QDk_bJh4bpk,1037280,1038798,pretty much swiped it from the hotel
QDk_bJh4bpk,1038798,1041038,just because i thought it was orange um
QDk_bJh4bpk,1041038,1042640,don't tell them
QDk_bJh4bpk,1042640,1044720,i guess it's on the internet so i guess
QDk_bJh4bpk,1044720,1046558,they know now if they ever watch this
QDk_bJh4bpk,1046558,1048160,which they won't queen size bed and
QDk_bJh4bpk,1048160,1049760,actually looking around all of this
QDk_bJh4bpk,1049760,1052160,furniture is from rogue concept so the
QDk_bJh4bpk,1052160,1054960,theme we wanted in the bedroom was white
QDk_bJh4bpk,1054960,1056720,of course all the walls the walnut wood
QDk_bJh4bpk,1056720,1058720,finish just to have things a bit more
QDk_bJh4bpk,1058720,1062240,warm a bit homelier and
QDk_bJh4bpk,1062240,1064720,yeah white with walnut so that counts
QDk_bJh4bpk,1064720,1066400,the bed the nightstands which we'll get
QDk_bJh4bpk,1066400,1069120,to this little tv console off this way
QDk_bJh4bpk,1069120,1071440,which always has swapped out tvs once
QDk_bJh4bpk,1071440,1073520,again just like my main tv in the living
QDk_bJh4bpk,1073520,1076160,room i go back and forth is the bedroom
QDk_bJh4bpk,1076160,1078880,a good spot for a tv should the bedroom
QDk_bJh4bpk,1078880,1081200,be tech free should this massive window
QDk_bJh4bpk,1081200,1085440,be covered by a 65 75 80 inch tv all
QDk_bJh4bpk,1085440,1088080,which we put in here it currently has no
QDk_bJh4bpk,1088080,1090160,tv and i think i do
QDk_bJh4bpk,1090160,1091919,like that better i try to keep the
QDk_bJh4bpk,1091919,1095200,bedroom free of tech in any way and if
QDk_bJh4bpk,1095200,1097039,you actually look at our nightstand so
QDk_bJh4bpk,1097039,1099840,my fiancee's nightstand has a light from
QDk_bJh4bpk,1099840,1101520,gantry which i think is super dope it's
QDk_bJh4bpk,1101520,1103440,a reading lamp some essential oils some
QDk_bJh4bpk,1103440,1107440,candles and cat now that you're not here
QDk_bJh4bpk,1107440,1109760,i always love to snipe this thing when
QDk_bJh4bpk,1109760,1111440,she's not home it's this little jade
QDk_bJh4bpk,1111440,1113919,roller and i just use this over my eyes
QDk_bJh4bpk,1113919,1116480,it feels so good
QDk_bJh4bpk,1116480,1119120,over on my side once again the same
QDk_bJh4bpk,1119120,1121440,reading lamp by gantry i have a couple
QDk_bJh4bpk,1121440,1123919,extra little pieces to charge my devices
QDk_bJh4bpk,1123919,1125840,so this cool little all-in-one charger
QDk_bJh4bpk,1125840,1128480,from logitech so it charges my iphone a
QDk_bJh4bpk,1128480,1130880,pair of headphones usually my air pods
QDk_bJh4bpk,1130880,1133600,and my apple watch and over on this side
QDk_bJh4bpk,1133600,1136480,we have lynx cage we initially trained
QDk_bJh4bpk,1136480,1138720,him to use the cage it's just kind of
QDk_bJh4bpk,1138720,1140799,there uh sometimes he likes to go in it
QDk_bJh4bpk,1140799,1143120,um at night he doesn't use it too much
QDk_bJh4bpk,1143120,1145679,but it's there just as a little option
QDk_bJh4bpk,1145679,1148160,and what we love about this space here
QDk_bJh4bpk,1148160,1150799,the balcony which is an area where uh we
QDk_bJh4bpk,1150799,1152480,don't honestly use too much we just have
QDk_bJh4bpk,1152480,1154559,link's little poop patch where he can
QDk_bJh4bpk,1154559,1156559,step out in the middle of the night or 6
QDk_bJh4bpk,1156559,1158880,7 a.m when he wakes up he just goes out
QDk_bJh4bpk,1158880,1161200,there to uh use the washroom and i
QDk_bJh4bpk,1161200,1162720,forgot to mention this actually when we
QDk_bJh4bpk,1162720,1165760,were in this area the main reason why we
QDk_bJh4bpk,1165760,1168640,loved this place or why i got this place
QDk_bJh4bpk,1168640,1171360,was the outdoor space the balcony is the
QDk_bJh4bpk,1171360,1173280,biggest selling point so it's around 800
QDk_bJh4bpk,1173280,1175520,square feet having a large space to our
QDk_bJh4bpk,1175520,1177120,own outside has just been so handy
QDk_bJh4bpk,1177120,1179039,especially uh during lockdown i think a
QDk_bJh4bpk,1179039,1180640,lot of you know over the past couple
QDk_bJh4bpk,1180640,1182720,years depending where you live a lot of
QDk_bJh4bpk,1182720,1184880,you we're just stuck inside and being
QDk_bJh4bpk,1184880,1186960,able to go outside whether that's for a
QDk_bJh4bpk,1186960,1188799,breath of fresh air link can wander
QDk_bJh4bpk,1188799,1190320,around outside of the balcony now that
QDk_bJh4bpk,1190320,1191440,the weather is getting better we're
QDk_bJh4bpk,1191440,1192880,going to put our cushions on our little
QDk_bJh4bpk,1192880,1195840,gazebo area it's a space that we love to
QDk_bJh4bpk,1195840,1197360,spend time on it's actually where i
QDk_bJh4bpk,1197360,1199120,propose to cat
QDk_bJh4bpk,1199120,1201360,so it's a really special place for us
QDk_bJh4bpk,1201360,1203840,it will be missed when we move away from
QDk_bJh4bpk,1203840,1205520,here but um
