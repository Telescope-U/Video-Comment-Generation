6-Oj83hX0Zg,7920,9750,"- Hello, welcome to the channel."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,9750,11940,"- Now this is gonna be a little mini series,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,11940,14099,"three episodes for our three normals,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,14100,15870,and they are going to battle it out
6-Oj83hX0Zg,15870,19410,"to create three amazing dishes, two portions of each,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,19410,22710,from a single grocery shopping list of ingredients.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,22710,25439,And we're only giving them £24 to spend.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,25440,28590,"Plus of course, as always, we want no food waste."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,28590,30690,Not going to be easy.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,30690,32610,Our normals have returned with some ingredients.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,32610,35010,They picked names out of a cloche
6-Oj83hX0Zg,35010,36870,"to pick the order, Mike went first."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,36870,39660,"It was an interesting cook-off, then Barry."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,39660,40493,- Zero waste.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,41340,43050,"- It is all still to play for, Jay."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,43050,46403,Your 30 minutes for your first recipe starts now.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,46403,47236,(bell dinging)
6-Oj83hX0Zg,47236,48570,"- Okay, right."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,48570,51300,"This recipe, I think, takes 40 minutes."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,51300,54750,"So, let's do it as quickly as we can."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,54750,55890,- I already like this.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,55890,57149,"- Yeah, of course you do."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,57150,60270,"Right, I have one of those over there, that goes in there."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,60270,63360,They're quite different sizes now. (chuckling)
6-Oj83hX0Zg,63360,64980,Staying alive.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,64980,67770,- I've never seen chicken change hands more.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,67770,69810,- I'm sharing my chicken across two recipes.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,69810,72540,- So what is it you are actually making in this dish?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,72540,75480,"- So the theme for my recipe pack is basically,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,75480,77520,how many Italians can I offend?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,77520,78750,- Nice. - Great.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,78750,83040,- What we're going for is a cheat's chicken
6-Oj83hX0Zg,83040,86490,"balsamic, mozzarella, parma."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,86490,87323,Chopped tomatoes.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,87323,89189,- Chicken balsamic mozzarella parma?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,89190,90777,The traditional method?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,90777,92130,(laughing)
6-Oj83hX0Zg,92130,93299,- Balsamic vinegar.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,93300,97080,They didn't have any chicken stock cubes in the shop.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,97080,101100,"So, I'm making up with some chicken gravy granules instead."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,101100,103619,That's gonna help thicken the sauce
6-Oj83hX0Zg,103620,105660,whilst adding a chicken flavour.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,105660,109933,"A little bit of sugar to sweeten everything up, some salt."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,109933,111843,- I'm liking the flair.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,112710,113543,- Garlic.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,113543,115740,"- I'm liking the one tray all-in chicken going,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,115740,117540,"not searing off or getting any colour,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,117540,119310,but actually it's just almost gonna poach and steam
6-Oj83hX0Zg,119310,120143,in that liquid.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,121590,122969,- Little bit of tomato puree.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,122970,123915,And then also-
6-Oj83hX0Zg,123915,125032,"- What are you, wow."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,125032,125909,- Cherry tomato.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,125910,127650,This is so tomato-y.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,127650,131160,"- Trio of tomato, cherry, tined and paste."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,131160,132390,- Is this the pinch point?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,132390,133770,- It's just gotta get in the oven.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,133770,136740,"- The oven I've preheated to 230 degrees Celsius,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,136740,138033,which is quite hot.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,138930,139950,"- He's getting massage-y,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,139950,142860,which is why he's taken his wedding rings off.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,142860,144090,"Oh, what now?"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,144090,144959,- Mixed herbs.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,144960,147604,- As a crumb on top or is that being mixed in?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,147604,149271,- Probably mixed in.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,150570,152790,- How many times can you touch a raw chicken breast?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,152790,153622,- Only doing it with one hand.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,153623,154680,"Look, this other hand's clean."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,154680,156090,- But you're still having to follow the other one
6-Oj83hX0Zg,156090,156940,back to the bowl.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,158760,159592,- How long have I got left?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,159593,161310,- You have 23 minutes left.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,161310,164280,- That can go into an oven for 22 minutes.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,164280,165660,We should be alright.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,165660,167100,"Right. - Well done, mate."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,167100,169290,- One panic done.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,169290,170640,"Let's do some mash potato, shall we?"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,170640,171472,- Oh!
6-Oj83hX0Zg,171473,172363,- Now.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,172363,173377,- He hasn't got time for that.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,173377,174794,- Twenty minutes?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,175636,178860,- Skin on mash because ain't nobody got time for peeling.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,178860,179693,- Amen.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,179693,181469,- There's a lot of flavour and a lot of fibre
6-Oj83hX0Zg,181470,183450,and a lot of good stuff in the skins.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,183450,185430,"So as long as they're clean, why not?"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,185430,186407,- Boil.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,186408,189300,I think I have 20 minutes to do nothing.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,189300,192090,- But then two minutes to do everything.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,192090,193080,- [Jamie] Flip the chicken.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,193080,195240,Grate some mozzarella over the top.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,195240,197040,- I need to use the grater more often.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,197040,198683,- You think that's what let you down?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,200100,200933,- [Jamie] Back in.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,200933,202560,- You've only got five minutes left now.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,202560,203520,- Spinach.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,203520,204990,"We can use half of it now,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,204990,207030,half of it in another recipe later in the week.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,207030,209550,What better water to blanch.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,209550,210383,- Smart.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,210383,212220,"- And then, lovely hack."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,212220,214560,- We've spoken many times about ingredients
6-Oj83hX0Zg,214560,216569,that kind of have a dual purpose.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,216570,217590,This is giving you the creaminess
6-Oj83hX0Zg,217590,218819,but also the flavour.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,218820,219810,- Mash that up.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,219810,221103,- Two and a half minutes.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,222660,224490,"- Cool, peps."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,224490,226380,- [Ben] Spinach going in.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,226380,228270,One minute thirty.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,228270,231240,- Hearty portions in the Spaff household.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,231240,233010,- That's serving two.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,233010,234722,- [Ben] 25 seconds.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,235860,237507,- [Barry] Oh yeah.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,237507,241165,- Cheese pull.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,241165,241997,- I'm just gonna cut it.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,241998,244144,- The cheese is stopping him from moving.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,244144,245403,It's so funny.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,245403,247063,There's cheese under the plate!
6-Oj83hX0Zg,247063,249775,"Mate, get it all in there!"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,249775,251741,"- Quick, last 10 seconds"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,251742,252660,"- [Barry] The other one, what's going on?"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,252660,253493,- I'm going!
6-Oj83hX0Zg,254814,256083,It's a slotted spoon!
6-Oj83hX0Zg,257280,259596,- Last five seconds.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,259596,261209,"Four, three."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,261209,262275,- You're gonna waste it.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,262275,264780,"- Two, one."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,264780,269670,Step away from what looks like an absolute feast.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,269670,271620,"- As I said, 40 minute recipe that one."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,273017,273850,- Good job.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,273850,274683,- Well done. - Nicely done.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,274683,275718,- Looks great.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,275718,278301,(upbeat music)
6-Oj83hX0Zg,283800,284879,- [Ben] You ready to give us a second?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,284880,286200,"- [Jamie] We should give it a try, shouldn't we?"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,286200,288750,"- Three, two, one, 30 minutes on the clock, off you go."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,288750,293400,- I am making home fries with some chorizo flavouring
6-Oj83hX0Zg,293400,294870,and onions and peppers.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,294870,295703,- Nice.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,295703,297900,- And I'm serving that with pizza baguettes.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,297900,300716,So I'm starting by chopping up my chorizo
6-Oj83hX0Zg,300717,303030,and I'm gonna get that cooking in a pan
6-Oj83hX0Zg,303030,304950,to release some of the oils
6-Oj83hX0Zg,304950,306780,"I'm then gonna take the chorizo out,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,306780,310470,"leave the oils in there, and cook my potatoes in it."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,310470,311760,"- Remember in this mini series,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,311760,314730,there are two skills badges up for grabs.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,314730,316950,"You have the planning badge,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,316950,319800,which is all about how you are devising
6-Oj83hX0Zg,319800,321629,and inspiring the dishes across the week
6-Oj83hX0Zg,321630,324480,"so you don't get bored, but with overlapping ingredients,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,324480,327270,and the second one is your food waste badge.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,327270,328770,"- [Jamie] Oil, a bit of salt."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,328770,329970,- [Ben] Season as we go.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,331560,333125,Also an excellent lid.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,333125,335670,- What a satisfying fit.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,335670,337020,- Half an onion from yesterday.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,337020,338009,Chop that up.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,338010,340350,- Never have I had a mainly potato based dish
6-Oj83hX0Zg,340350,342990,"and thought, you know what this needs?."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,342990,343906,A sandwich.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,345480,347370,"- [Ben] And this is why, genuinely, this mini series"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,347370,348203,"is quite interesting,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,348203,349590,'cause you've all gone and picked
6-Oj83hX0Zg,349590,350487,"very different ingredients,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,350487,353190,but they all played to your individual styles
6-Oj83hX0Zg,353190,354436,and approaches to cooking.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,354436,356340,(indistinct)
6-Oj83hX0Zg,356340,358860,"- Very good dice of onion and the pepper, the same."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,358860,360009,- Corner shop baguette.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,362250,364170,That did not work the way I wanted it to.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,364170,365430,Cream cheese from yesterday.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,365430,366263,- Yeah.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,366263,367350,- He's going for your jugular.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,367350,368183,"- Yeah, he is."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,368183,369030,"- I don't know if this is gonna work,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,369030,370980,but it feels to me like it should.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,370980,373155,"- 16 minutes left, Jay, you're coming up to halfway."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,373155,374130,"- [Barry] Well, what's that?"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,374130,374963,Mystery tin.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,374963,376560,"- No, this is chopped tomatoes."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,376560,377580,- What's that for?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,377580,378513,- For my pizza.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,379470,382740,"I think I can use this, but I can't use all of it."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,382740,383639,- Does it need it?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,387150,390630,Whilst Barry had that kind of Turkish pepper running
6-Oj83hX0Zg,390630,391890,through all of his dishes.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,391890,392723,- Nearly did it.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,392723,395130,- [Ben] Jamie's gone for tomato through all three of his.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,395130,396480,"- No, 'cause it's gonna have cherry tomatoes"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,396480,397313,in the third one.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,397313,399473,- It can go back to your gravy granules for another day.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,400860,401763,- Oh my word.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,404034,404934,- [Barry] Oh yeah.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,408615,410660,- [Ben] He's got his oven up nice and high.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,415740,417300,"Okay, Jay, eight minutes left."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,417300,418133,- Eight minutes.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,418133,419240,- Pizzas are in the oven.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,421410,422520,- Looking yummy.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,422520,425550,- My portions to feed two might feed three.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,425550,428310,- The chicken was presumably the most expensive part.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,428310,429143,- [Jamie] Yes.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,429143,431940,- But the rest all look fairly equal.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,431940,434070,"- Pretty much, chorizo is actually fairly cheap,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,434070,436461,balsamic vinegar was cheaper than I expected it to be.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,436461,437520,(beep) out.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,437520,439349,- Three and a half minutes on the clock.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,439350,440910,- There's so much food.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,440910,443280,"- Sounding good, it's smelling good."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,443280,444843,45 seconds.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,452580,454259,- Last 25 seconds.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,454260,455433,- Wow.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,456420,461420,"- You got five, four, three, two, one."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,461550,464745,- That's a lot of food.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,464745,465912,- Nicely done.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,465912,466745,- Good job mate.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,466745,467578,- Let's do two more.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,467578,469120,Count me in Ebbers in Italian
6-Oj83hX0Zg,470490,472332,"- Three, two, one, go"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,472333,474060,"- Right, chorizo."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,474060,476820,"The rest of this slimy basil, the rest of my bread."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,476820,480720,"An onion, some garlic, chicken, pepper."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,480720,481920,- You just gonna take all of it.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,481920,485790,"- Cherry tomato, gherkins, I'll come onto that in a second."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,485790,489540,"Balsamic vinegar, store cupboard leftover."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,489540,492360,I am making cheats Panzanella.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,492360,493620,- Cheats Panzanella.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,493620,495449,"- He means, incorrect Panzanella."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,495450,496620,"- Yeah, basically, yeah."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,496620,500322,"- You're adding in by the looks of it, chicken and chorizo."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,500322,501479,- I feel like you're missing one thing.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,501480,503790,"The nuance of garlic around the bowl, the mystery nuance."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,503790,505740,"- I didn't wanna start with a nuance,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,505740,508349,"because once you start, it's hard to stop."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,508350,509700,- Could you could describe what the nuance
6-Oj83hX0Zg,509700,511650,of garlic you're doing there and what it does.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,511650,514620,- It adds an aroma and a flair.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,514620,516810,So you just rub it on the inside of the bowl.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,516810,519810,I'm gonna get it all up in the tomatoes as well.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,519810,522120,- So you just rub it in the middle of everything?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,522120,524790,- It's usually my first step in the method.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,524790,525779,- I could keep it there
6-Oj83hX0Zg,525780,529170,and use it for the chicken chorizo later but we'll see.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,529170,530550,Another dice of pepper.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,530550,532950,I make this at home quite a lot during the summer.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,532950,533970,"And this is gonna sound ridiculous,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,533970,535230,'cause it'll end up being a massive portion.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,535230,538143,"I don't know, but it's quite a nice light summery meal."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,539400,541320,They did not have capers in the little Sainsbury's.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,541320,543660,"So I went for the next best thing, gherkins."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,543660,547019,"I think if I dice them up small, you'll tell the difference"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,547020,548460,but it'll do a similar job.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,548460,550530,"- Less briny, but they've got almost a sweetness to them,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,550530,552540,but probably a nicer crunch than a caper.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,552540,553470,- Into the bowl.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,553470,555329,- Do you think you can beat Barry?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,555330,556237,- My biggest fear.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,556237,557708,"- Well, what about yourself?"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,557708,558541,- [Mike] That's sarcastic.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,558541,559791,- [Barry] Yeah.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,560850,563670,"- Top water taking the edge off of the raw onion,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,563670,565829,perfectly sliced and then nicely ripped.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,565830,567810,21 minutes remaining.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,567810,569310,They are caper size now.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,569310,570779,I love the fact that your first dish
6-Oj83hX0Zg,570780,573630,was heavy on balsamic with the tomato in that bake.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,573630,575760,And you're using the balsamic here as well.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,575760,578081,"- [Mike] Getting massagy, going in with the good stuff."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,579630,581400,- And this feels a little bit back to front.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,581400,583140,"'Cause obviously you've got raw chicken which needs cooking,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,583140,584850,and this is just a side you throw together.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,584850,586290,- [Barry] Yeah. - But by doing this first
6-Oj83hX0Zg,586290,588540,and letting all those juices soak into the bread
6-Oj83hX0Zg,588540,590610,absolutely onto a winner.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,590610,591662,- Clingfilm it.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,594270,595103,- Time check
6-Oj83hX0Zg,595103,596013,- Don't lose the end.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,597013,599333,- It's been four minutes since he got the cling film out.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,600330,602040,- [Ben] 16 minutes left.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,602040,603449,- Oh my goodness.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,603450,604520,"- Jay, you only have 16 minutes."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,604520,605790,- Oh my goodness.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,605790,606880,Honestly
6-Oj83hX0Zg,608360,609193,- Would you like-
6-Oj83hX0Zg,609193,610987,- This is what I needed.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,610987,611846,No!
6-Oj83hX0Zg,611846,613080,- [Ben] Would you like me to do it for you?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,613080,614807,- Do not help him.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,614807,615753,"- No, yes."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,618330,621000,And then use that really easy peeling
6-Oj83hX0Zg,621000,623130,clingfilm to shake everything up.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,623130,624900,Let that sit there.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,624900,626990,Room temperature to...
6-Oj83hX0Zg,632141,634273,A little bit of oil to get it going.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,634273,636000,"- Cool, calm and collected"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,636000,638280,with 13 minutes left on the clock.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,638280,639300,- Let's do some chicken.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,639300,642039,- This is gonna be a tough judging sequence.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,642039,642872,It's gonna be tight.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,642872,644387,- Even with Mike include. - No.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,644387,646350,- It's gonna be tight at the top.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,646350,648930,"- Well done, look at that, look at that."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,648930,649763,- Restraint.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,649763,651483,"Well, the damage has been done."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,653430,655050,- What's that clove of garlic doing on the hob?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,655050,656160,- Oh.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,656160,657990,"- [Barry] That's what nuances though, that's how you do it."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,657990,659100,- Just put it near. - Yeah.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,659100,660420,- In the facility of.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,660420,662480,"- [Mike] If you wanna waste it, then that's fine."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,666210,667290,- [Ben] So the chicken colouring off
6-Oj83hX0Zg,667290,668730,in the same pan with the oil.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,668730,670652,You have five minutes remaining.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,672330,673980,- There's really quite a lot in there boys.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,673980,675540,"- It's enough for four again, isn't it?"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,675540,677610,"- Yeah, the chicken's gonna have an extra"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,677610,678630,garlicyness that I wasn't-
6-Oj83hX0Zg,678630,679950,"- Like a Bay leaf, you're gonna take it out"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,679950,681060,"before you serve it, or is it just-"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,681060,682500,"- Nothing like a Bay leaf, Ebbers,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,682500,685710,you're gonna be able to taste that this was in here.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,685710,687030,- Coming up to the final few minutes.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,687030,689910,We always say buy the best that you can afford.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,689910,691832,Today's budget was £24.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,692790,695490,I think you've all got an amazing amount of food for that.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,695490,698547,"- Annoyingly, Jamie does what he always does."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,698547,699990,"He's gone big, it's the flavour."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,699990,701850,It catches us out every time.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,701850,703290,It's one in battles per pass.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,703290,706316,Presentation I think I'm safe.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,706317,707910,- You got a hundred seconds.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,707910,710850,"- Excellent, I'm going to give this garlic to the bin now."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,710850,713069,"It's done its job, peel off the cling film."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,713070,715350,-It's easy to get off the bowl isn't it?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,715350,716970,- There is so much.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,716970,718769,- Last 40 seconds.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,718770,721020,"- [Mike] He can't see the colour red,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,721020,723077,"yet, it's clearly his favourite colour."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,723077,724980,(all laughing)
6-Oj83hX0Zg,724980,726123,- Last 10 seconds.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,726123,728100,- Do a chorizo crumb.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,728100,737209,"Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,737490,738330,- [Ben] Stop.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,738330,741933,That is spectacular.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,743310,744407,Lets get it in the sexies.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,745971,748554,(upbeat music)
6-Oj83hX0Zg,772155,775710,I don't think there could be six more Jamie Spafford
6-Oj83hX0Zg,775710,777120,plates of food in front of us.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,777120,778680,Should we start at this end?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,778680,779580,Cheers.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,779580,780413,- Cheers.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,785070,788400,- The tanginess from tomato and balsamic is so good.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,788400,789990,It just kind of makes you smile.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,789990,791640,"I think on its own, it would be too much"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,791640,794100,"if it didn't have the mash to offset it,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,794100,795029,but it's not designed like that.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,795030,796200,It's designed to be with that mash
6-Oj83hX0Zg,796200,797033,which is nice and creamy.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,797033,799020,And this spinach is wonderful.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,799020,800250,- Love that cream cheese hack.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,800250,801120,- Could have done a bit more work
6-Oj83hX0Zg,801120,803043,"on your plating, but otherwise, great."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,804180,805323,- Is it pizza time?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,806520,808405,- Or is it chips time?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,813542,815040,Those fries are great.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,815040,815873,- Yeah.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,815873,818880,"All the individual parts of those home fries, cook so well."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,818880,820020,Golden potatoes cooked through
6-Oj83hX0Zg,820020,822090,but spinach only just.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,822090,823950,"Peppers still got a slight bite to them,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,823950,825300,I really like that.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,825300,826830,"- I mean, I've called it baguette pizza,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,826830,829820,"but we could call it bruschetta, if we wanted to."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,829820,832500,- With French baguette and Spanish chorizo.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,832500,833850,- Yes. - Yeah.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,833850,836056,"- Oh, now we're talking, look at that."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,836056,837633,I think it's a hell of a sandwich.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,837633,840120,- [Mike] That really looks appealing.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,840120,842550,"- Last but not least, the light salad."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,842550,843810,- This is a pants down panzanella.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,843810,846407,- This is pants down panzanella.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,847920,850470,"- Quite some soggy ass bread, wow."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,850470,853560,- There's tomato and chorizo on everything.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,853560,856329,"And they all taste different, completely different."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,856329,857188,- Oh.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,861810,865620,"- It was like a waterfall chorizo oil at the end,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,865620,867450,but there's not a puddle at the bottom.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,867450,869250,That has been soaked into that bread
6-Oj83hX0Zg,869250,871290,which is what makes it so damn delicious.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,871290,873573,- Chicken's a bit chewy if I was gonna be all right (beep).
6-Oj83hX0Zg,873573,875550,"- No, that's fine."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,875550,877627,"- While the chicken is a little over,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,877627,879330,I like that you've got over with the chorizo.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,879330,882060,"You could probably have got nine plates of food,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,882060,886260,"but in terms of flavour, they all more than deliver."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,886260,888780,I need a moment to tot up the scores for Jay
6-Oj83hX0Zg,888780,890190,and then we will compare them
6-Oj83hX0Zg,890190,892860,to all three of you to find a winner.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,892860,896006,"And remember the winner takes home, both badges,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,896007,896840,"- Oh, whoa."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,896840,899430,- The menu planning and the food waste badge.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,899430,903420,"20 points on offer for each of your dishes,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,903420,905339,an additional 20 for the planning
6-Oj83hX0Zg,905340,908430,and concepts and ideas of ingredient sharing
6-Oj83hX0Zg,908430,909870,and a final 20 of execution.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,909870,912051,How well you're actually cooking and plating.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,912051,913260,- What does that equal Barry?
6-Oj83hX0Zg,913260,914093,- About a hundred.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,914093,915180,- About a hundred.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,915180,916620,- You're gonna get a percentage score.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,916620,917760,"Mike, you went first"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,917760,922140,you had your steak ciabatta with caramelised onions
6-Oj83hX0Zg,922140,923763,and that mayonaisy thing.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,924990,926433,I gave it six out of 20.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,927450,930960,"The Turkey Milanese was by far your best dish,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,930960,933450,"balanced, delicious, wonderful."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,933450,936153,And scored more than twice that with 14 points.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,937050,938640,And then the jacket salad.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,938640,940950,"Also a bit confused, heavy on the Mayo"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,940950,943050,not much Turkey in your coronation mix
6-Oj83hX0Zg,943050,946410,and a raw onion salad on the side got seven out of 20.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,946410,950970,"However, the planning and the concept of sharing ingredients"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,950970,955709,especially the eggs across the dishes was really smart.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,955710,957870,So that got 13 points out of 20.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,957870,960990,"And execution, I don't think it was your day."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,960990,961830,- None of it was my day.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,961830,963240,- There was some overcooked bits.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,963240,964500,There were some burnt bits.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,964500,966870,There was a failed mayonnaise.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,966870,971870,"So, seven out 20, a total of 47%."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,972640,974373,- That actually feels generous.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,975210,976043,"- Bass you're up next,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,976043,979440,"and you started with your chicken wrap thing,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,979440,981420,gave that 16 out of 20.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,981420,982683,Strong contender.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,983580,985740,"Butter been salad, absolutely nothing wrong with that."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,985740,990740,"14 out of 20 and the aubergine eggs Turkish in style,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,991350,995043,"in the bread bowl, best dish of the series, worth 17."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,996450,997324,- Good.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,997324,998910,"- Well played mate, well played."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,998910,1001970,"- Planning, gave you 16 out of 20"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1001970,1004129,for all of those overlap and sharing ingredients
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1004130,1007520,and yet three very different styles of food.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1007520,1011123,"And execution, very good today, 15 out 20."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1012650,1013483,- Well done.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1013483,1014360,- Thank you.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1014360,1017450,- 78% bold.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1017450,1018620,- Wow.
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1018620,1020960,"- Which means it was all to play for, for Jay."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1020960,1024050,Jamie began with his tomato balsamic chicken
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1024050,1027110,"one baked tray thing, which was lovely with the cream cheese"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1027110,1030532,"and spinach mash, solid at 15 out of 20."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1031730,1034370,Your home fries with all the added extras
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1034370,1038089,"and then the pizza, 14 out 20."
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1038089,1040189,"And to finish off the panzanella,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1040189,1041959,"really full on flavours,"
6-Oj83hX0Zg,1041959,1044539,"super simple as a nice midweek finish,"
