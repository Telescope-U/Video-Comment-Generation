KpbSwSEYhR4,12400,17840,we're used to seeing her in the last  couple of games just single digit  scoring here for her the tip goes to
KpbSwSEYhR4,17840,23119,minnesota and we're underway  mariah jefferson is the straw that makes
KpbSwSEYhR4,23119,28400,this offense go the lynx run some really  good actions offensively here
KpbSwSEYhR4,28400,34079,are you going to press what with their  especially their offensive efficiency  the last five games coming into this one
KpbSwSEYhR4,34079,40719,they feed fouls who gets the touch but  tipped away and deflected and it's a  first possession and a first turnover
KpbSwSEYhR4,40719,46079,for the links that's quick hands by  candice that time because that post feed
KpbSwSEYhR4,46079,52879,looks like sylvia fowle's gonna score  that one yeah the question is who would  be  defending sylvia faust as an and one for
KpbSwSEYhR4,52879,59329,me  she's got a free throw here coming up  [Applause]
KpbSwSEYhR4,60640,65840,with her eyes always up  finds a cutting miseman takes the

KpbSwSEYhR4,81759,87360,what i've been so impressed with the way  the sky has been able to integrate  emma misema into what they're doing she
KpbSwSEYhR4,87360,94420,is really comfortable playing great well  they certainly have found their stride  with a little bit of everything that's  an air ball for aerial powers
KpbSwSEYhR4,94420,100479,[Applause]  you know james wade not coaching in this  game  emory
KpbSwSEYhR4,100479,107040,is the acting head coach here tonight  james wade and health and safety  protocols made the call to his assistant
KpbSwSEYhR4,107040,113280,his top assistant here this morning so  our best goes out to james  they said that there might be some muted
KpbSwSEYhR4,113280,118479,communication at halftime but james  basically told him you got this  you're not my top assistant for no
KpbSwSEYhR4,118479,124479,reason there's a first bucket  kayla mcbride kind of smiling coming up  the court
KpbSwSEYhR4,124479,130640,i don't know if she's  didn't think she was going to get that  outlet pass she caught up to it
KpbSwSEYhR4,130640,137200,sanders loot turns it over mcbride picks  it off  and a foul committed there on the break
KpbSwSEYhR4,137200,142239,ali quigley  gets her first  that wasn't necessarily a bad foul
KpbSwSEYhR4,142239,148239,looked like the lynx had a numbers  advantage  possibly going for an easy do so
KpbSwSEYhR4,148239,154720,as long as ali is  aware of her foul situation that might  not have been a bad foul sheryl flores
KpbSwSEYhR4,154720,161120,randy richardson ryan sessano are the  officials here tonight  [Music]

KpbSwSEYhR4,209599,216319,yes slooty's one of the best lobby years  to their officials in the league in my  opinion
KpbSwSEYhR4,216319,223440,mcbride that's a long two  [Applause]  i'm gonna emphasize to our viewers what
KpbSwSEYhR4,223440,229519,you said lisa  this is much better than a five win team  in the links playing some of the best
KpbSwSEYhR4,229519,235920,basketball here in the last five games  well they're getting healthier candice  parker rings it up from teeth on her
KpbSwSEYhR4,235920,242879,first attempt  nice job by the sky
KpbSwSEYhR4,242879,247439,getting everyone involved here early  offensively

KpbSwSEYhR4,269440,279169,animated and not agreeing with that call  for cheryl flores  [Applause]
KpbSwSEYhR4,279199,283800,see candace tracks down the loose ball
KpbSwSEYhR4,285840,294080,dantas is slow to recover and she knocks  down the three but  [Applause]
KpbSwSEYhR4,294080,300479,candice may have been a little bit  animated in her potential lobby she  immediately sprinted back
KpbSwSEYhR4,300479,308560,to try to get the attention of sheryl  flores  she traveled that's a good call
KpbSwSEYhR4,308560,313620,and you can't be so demonstrative in  waving the official law like
KpbSwSEYhR4,313620,319199,[Music]  like that can't do that that's that's  showing up the official unfortunately
KpbSwSEYhR4,319199,326240,cannon's got the technical  up and over the outstretched arms rachel  bannon isn't six five
KpbSwSEYhR4,326240,333120,that's a that's a misconnection from a  couple of big ten alums from ariel  powers and rachel bannon oh wow
KpbSwSEYhR4,333120,339840,i don't know if they ever thought that  they would hear that coming out of the  mouse's mouth
KpbSwSEYhR4,341280,348160,they were a part of  honestly one of my most favorite games  to call in big ten country museum in the
KpbSwSEYhR4,348160,355360,shore  and candace parker gets the offensive  rebound defended by bana
KpbSwSEYhR4,355440,361840,ali quickly  this is an interesting matchup ali also  by the way turns it over but also a part
KpbSwSEYhR4,361840,367440,of that 2008 draft class to go along  with sylvia fowles and candace parker
KpbSwSEYhR4,367440,373120,it's a  great research bit by you lisa  digging deep
KpbSwSEYhR4,373120,376639,pulling out the good nuggets there
KpbSwSEYhR4,379360,385840,they're trying to isolate sylvia on the  box that time  good job by candice staying high early
KpbSwSEYhR4,385840,390639,taking it inside ariel powers draws the  foul
KpbSwSEYhR4,391280,397440,she'll have a couple free throws here  coming up and omisomin picks it up for  her first
KpbSwSEYhR4,402160,409039,you're watching wnba basketball the  minnesota links against the chicago sky  and in chicagoland we want to welcome in
KpbSwSEYhR4,409039,415599,on marquis sports network all the  viewers watching the cubs take care of  the cards lisa byington stephen bardo

KpbSwSEYhR4,423840,429280,today second best record in the league  [Applause]
KpbSwSEYhR4,429280,435440,even when  khalia copper doesn't have her a game  the sky is still dominant in their
KpbSwSEYhR4,435440,442080,victory last game against the sparks and  i mean it wasn't close  the viewers just joining us no kalia
KpbSwSEYhR4,442080,447680,copper last year's wnba finals mvp but  they do have ali quickly and emma misam
KpbSwSEYhR4,447680,453680,in for that connection and a backdoor  look for two  emma misa man allows the sky to be so
KpbSwSEYhR4,453680,460720,much more flexible offensively because  of her skill set her ability to pass  rebound shoot
KpbSwSEYhR4,460720,467520,and sylvia fouls his whistle for the  offensive foul lower that shoulder a  little bit too much and still picks up
KpbSwSEYhR4,467520,474400,her first  this is beautiful execution hit the high  post the defense is denying
KpbSwSEYhR4,474400,481520,aly quickly goes back door for the easy  deuce that's great execution by the sky
KpbSwSEYhR4,484800,491360,anderson looking inside  eastman was calling for being defended  by jessica shepard
KpbSwSEYhR4,491360,497430,back to her look that's been working  could put it away  and on the push here comes bana
KpbSwSEYhR4,497430,502639,[Applause]  and sylvia walked with it so the last
KpbSwSEYhR4,502639,508879,couple of possessions an offensive foul  and a walking violation a couple of  turnovers by still she'll take a seat
KpbSwSEYhR4,508879,515919,that was a great defensive adjustment by  candice parker that time when sylvia  fowles caught the basketball she jabbed
KpbSwSEYhR4,515919,522399,like she was going for the pass play it  threw sylvia off forcing the turnover  all kinds of emotion for sylvia fowles
KpbSwSEYhR4,522399,528560,returning to  play in chicago possibly for the the  last time
KpbSwSEYhR4,528560,533600,announcing her retirement this would be  her last one there's a lefty finish for  rebecca gardner
KpbSwSEYhR4,533600,539760,that was pretty  start left crossover come  come back into the paint
KpbSwSEYhR4,539760,545040,rebecca gardner in her bag early getting  the start in the place of kalia copper
KpbSwSEYhR4,545040,550480,and for those of you just joining us a  four-point edge here for this guy  [Applause]
KpbSwSEYhR4,550480,557519,and we'll head back the other way  431 left to play in the first quarter
KpbSwSEYhR4,557519,563680,you want to go look at this rebecca  garner talked about the system right the  chicago sky has and and that's when you
KpbSwSEYhR4,563680,570480,know you have a good franchise when you  have a good quote-unquote program if you  will  and that uh you can maybe
KpbSwSEYhR4,570480,575920,plug  and place people right and then  some of those leadership positions and
KpbSwSEYhR4,575920,581600,and these players  leadership and and veteran leadership is  is kind of what they hang their hat on
KpbSwSEYhR4,581600,587360,right now obviously championship  pedigree  quickly taking it inside for two
KpbSwSEYhR4,587360,594000,well that is an indication of how  healthy ally has become  a little hesi to freeze the defense
KpbSwSEYhR4,594000,600399,momentarily right there  step through  strong off of her right leg going to the
KpbSwSEYhR4,600399,607120,rim  finishing through contact one of those  vets that we're talking about right just  kind of go do your thing that's right
KpbSwSEYhR4,607120,612800,but nothing really has to change  you may not hear james's voice as much  but
KpbSwSEYhR4,612800,618880,we won't even hear james boyce as well  i'm gonna kind of miss that here at the  home game he walks right by us
KpbSwSEYhR4,618880,624560,and he throws this confetti every now  and then as well so we'll miss that  obviously coach
KpbSwSEYhR4,624560,630399,get better soon  that's right just recently named gonna  be the all-star coach here on this very
KpbSwSEYhR4,630399,635519,floor  july 10th here coming up in the city of  chicago
KpbSwSEYhR4,635519,641360,exciting times here for chicago good  post up there by shepard and she owned  rebecca gardner there on that play i'll
KpbSwSEYhR4,641360,646959,tell you what jessica shepard is  becoming one of my favorite players in  this league multi-skill can do
KpbSwSEYhR4,646959,653279,everything on the floor great feel for  the game started her career at nebraska  won a national championship at notre
KpbSwSEYhR4,653279,660560,dame gardner is off the mark  it's a really good job and  shepard has in terms of getting fitter
KpbSwSEYhR4,660560,668000,and better she's been affected by some  injuries but having her best season as a  pro here so far this year
KpbSwSEYhR4,668480,674720,rebound to azeri stevens who's now  getting some minutes  julie aleman has also checked in at the
KpbSwSEYhR4,674720,679759,guard position here for chicago parker  lets it fly
KpbSwSEYhR4,681600,688079,allie with the pump fake  and powers up in the air there's azar  stevens a little rainbow three thank you
KpbSwSEYhR4,688079,693760,very much yeah that's right stevens  really finding the range from long range  here in the last three games no
KpbSwSEYhR4,693760,698800,hesitation whatsoever  she is flirting with possibly her best
KpbSwSEYhR4,698800,705920,three-point shooting season of her  career  that three-point make she's hit 52 of
KpbSwSEYhR4,705920,713519,them this year she hit  i'm sorry she's hit 22 of them she hit  28 in a rookie season
KpbSwSEYhR4,713519,720000,and shawn one for two natalie  that's a really good move  let the defense slide past her
KpbSwSEYhR4,720000,726399,easy deuce the links would kind of  settle down after five early turnovers
KpbSwSEYhR4,727440,732639,aleman taking the screen from parker  and finding garden that's a hard pass to
KpbSwSEYhR4,732639,739120,handle  comes the links on the push
KpbSwSEYhR4,739120,744240,what their last two against phoenix and  jefferson knocks down the jumper all
KpbSwSEYhR4,744240,750320,right jefferson  yes jefferson  is so into her game really doesn't get
KpbSwSEYhR4,750320,755360,outside much she's quick as a hiccup can  get past almost anybody but takes what
KpbSwSEYhR4,755360,762000,the defense gives her on that jumper 20  points in the last two out of three  games here coming into tonight
KpbSwSEYhR4,762000,771040,now six to shoot parker with that touch  pass finds out to ray stevens over to  gardiner back to stevens left it short
KpbSwSEYhR4,771040,776639,the gazza ray knew the shot clock was  running down left  pull back a little bit right yeah didn't
KpbSwSEYhR4,776639,784000,follow through  shepard going off the bounce against  parker shovel pass the powers
KpbSwSEYhR4,784000,788880,and gardner  would be the one picking up that foul
KpbSwSEYhR4,790160,796000,ariel powers is  she's gonna look for her shot early and  often
KpbSwSEYhR4,796000,801079,nice job cutting without the basketball  once again
KpbSwSEYhR4,805600,812160,so good at getting to the free-throw  line third in the league in terms of  free-throw makes right behind
KpbSwSEYhR4,812160,817519,brianna stewart diana taurasi  [Music]
KpbSwSEYhR4,817519,824320,how about that coaching staff rebecca  brunson cheryl reeve  katie smith
KpbSwSEYhR4,824320,831040,hall of fame hall of fame yeah  you what  that's why there's no panic whatsoever
KpbSwSEYhR4,831040,836480,with this lynx team in spite of that  five and thirteen start  it's just a matter of time they're
KpbSwSEYhR4,836480,843279,getting as you said they're getting  healthier  you get civilian foles back into the  fold no pun intended
KpbSwSEYhR4,843279,849680,uh things can look up  rebecca bunsen they're gonna retire her  jersey coming up on july third
KpbSwSEYhR4,849680,854120,one of the home games up in minneapolis
KpbSwSEYhR4,856610,862320,[Applause]  turnover  here's mcbride on the push
KpbSwSEYhR4,862320,867920,over to powers  and again she'll go back to the  free-throw line
KpbSwSEYhR4,867920,873839,ariel powers with free throws five and  six in this game coming on
KpbSwSEYhR4,873839,880000,aerial powers has sort of a throwback  game because  players in today's generation in my
KpbSwSEYhR4,880000,887360,opinion don't seek out the contact as  much maybe as they used to maybe 10  years ago but ariel does a fantastic job
KpbSwSEYhR4,887360,893279,of seeking that contact out  she is using money from the line
KpbSwSEYhR4,895790,900880,[Applause]  we got to remember this is the
KpbSwSEYhR4,900880,907440,in terms of  veteran play and years of experience the  length of the third most experienced
KpbSwSEYhR4,907440,913360,team in the league  so  i keep stressing that ladies and  gentlemen because this is a good a good
KpbSwSEYhR4,913360,919600,team that  is not indicative of this of their  record all right still no  cal here as we mentioned out of with
KpbSwSEYhR4,919600,925040,maternity leave a healthier sylvia  fowles cheryl reeve told us that she is  on a minutes restriction again here
KpbSwSEYhR4,925040,930890,tonight wouldn't say what that was  and vandersloot turns it over
KpbSwSEYhR4,930890,935920,[Music]  well the links have really turned up
KpbSwSEYhR4,935920,940360,their defense here in the last few  possessions
KpbSwSEYhR4,942480,948320,chicago won the first meeting 82-78  back on may 14th there's a look in a
KpbSwSEYhR4,948320,954320,three-point knock down that time  bridgette carlton has hit a three now in
KpbSwSEYhR4,954320,961680,eight straight games after that  well it's a nice drag action by the  links that time going baseline setting
KpbSwSEYhR4,961680,966399,the back screen  open for a three
KpbSwSEYhR4,967519,975600,here's the look their first lead here  tonight  aleman tosses it nice lefty finish
KpbSwSEYhR4,975600,980639,i see you getting in the paint  that was a tough finish as you said
KpbSwSEYhR4,980639,986720,going full speed away from the defense  ties it at 20.  first points for a player that hasn't
KpbSwSEYhR4,986720,992399,done a whole lot of score in here so far  seven total points
KpbSwSEYhR4,992399,998320,in about six full games here so far  shepard picks it up and the foul against
KpbSwSEYhR4,998320,1001279,azeray stevens
KpbSwSEYhR4,1005279,1012959,you know julie aleman  going hard down to paint draws three  defenders off and off glass
KpbSwSEYhR4,1012959,1019680,beautiful move  just shepard to the free throw line  averaging career highs this year points
KpbSwSEYhR4,1019680,1026079,per game rebounds per game minutes per  game a huge sample size to compare this
KpbSwSEYhR4,1026079,1034000,year with the the rest of her career  talked about the injuries that she's  she's had to navigate through
KpbSwSEYhR4,1034000,1039400,well you you recognize that she's in  great shape
KpbSwSEYhR4,1041280,1047199,that'll be the first quarter and the  links with a two-point edge over this  guy 22 to 20.
KpbSwSEYhR4,1047199,1054400,turn the page this second quarter coming  up  restriction and um i had a chance to  talk to her in pregame and i said
KpbSwSEYhR4,1054400,1059600,are you really because she could she  could dictate a little bit about her own  minute restriction i said i said does
KpbSwSEYhR4,1059600,1064720,the fact that you're playing back in  chicago play into that she kind of gave  me this rise smile  [Laughter]
KpbSwSEYhR4,1064720,1071120,wouldn't answer it directly but but you  gotta wonder  i'll tell you what
KpbSwSEYhR4,1071120,1076960,yeah offensive foul call on me  [Applause]  so a nice gesture here by the franchise
KpbSwSEYhR4,1076960,1082960,this is pre-k look at her lift up salute  they honored her of course since her  last season
KpbSwSEYhR4,1082960,1088240,sylvia fowle's retiring after this year  i think this guy were so smart and doing
KpbSwSEYhR4,1088240,1094240,this trying to butter her up and  soften her up a little bit  you know make her feel good about
KpbSwSEYhR4,1094240,1100160,herself  so she won't come out here and be  dominant like she normally take out that  tough sylvia fowles out of her right
KpbSwSEYhR4,1100160,1107919,that's right  a chanwa  mid-range jumper  azeray stevens trying to poke it away
KpbSwSEYhR4,1107919,1115039,into the hands here of me simon  azaray and candace parker do a really  good job of tapping the ball even if
KpbSwSEYhR4,1115039,1120320,they can't secure it try to tap it to a  teammate that can do something with it  those deflections that won't show up on
KpbSwSEYhR4,1120320,1127679,the box score there's a fade away there  for me  that's so pretty  just fading away from the defense
KpbSwSEYhR4,1127679,1134400,she's got an unorthodox game  that is so effective just keeps our  defenders off balance bit of a low
KpbSwSEYhR4,1134400,1140960,scoring first half of both of these  teams put up some points and as i say  that jefferson knocks down the triple
KpbSwSEYhR4,1140960,1148559,try  [Music]  why stevens on the kick back here 4-3
KpbSwSEYhR4,1148559,1155200,i say put up some points lately season  high 60 points in the last game of the  first half against the phoenix team here
KpbSwSEYhR4,1155200,1161600,from minnesota  there's a lay-in there for me  for that non-verbal communication
KpbSwSEYhR4,1161600,1166880,between me cement and slooty  boy it's getting better and better by  the game they're burning the links right
KpbSwSEYhR4,1166880,1172320,on some of those backdoor cuts here in  the first half  shepard
KpbSwSEYhR4,1172320,1177760,right hand dribble drive and finishing  with the left hand  i'm telling you ladies and gentlemen
KpbSwSEYhR4,1177760,1184320,you're watching one of the best players  in the league  right there nothing she can't do on the  floor

KpbSwSEYhR4,3262400,3268319,there's such a connection with the sky  players whether they're coming in off  the pitch or the starters
KpbSwSEYhR4,3268319,3274480,they're just in such great rhythm right  now this is without playing with khalia  copper on the bench and street clothes
KpbSwSEYhR4,3274480,3283219,out with a back injury you got to make  up for those 14 points per game somehow  [Applause]
KpbSwSEYhR4,3289119,3294240,dana evans looking for it  that was a heat check

KpbSwSEYhR4,3333790,3340400,[Music]  defending powers all she needed was that
KpbSwSEYhR4,3340400,3348920,screen  powers is two of eight shooting  nine points here tonight
KpbSwSEYhR4,3350240,3356720,the touch pass over to gardiner  some of the reserves working with misa  men in this rotation and the starters
KpbSwSEYhR4,3356720,3362359,waiting to check back in gardner's got  it open look
KpbSwSEYhR4,3362799,3366480,can't get much better ball movement than  that
KpbSwSEYhR4,3368160,3373280,boy the sky unit right now really tired  [Applause]  [Music]
KpbSwSEYhR4,3373280,3379440,and aleman picks up one of those fatigue  fouls if you will they'll get some
KpbSwSEYhR4,3379440,3386480,support three starters checking back in  and this fist that ties her  season high here this year puts her up
KpbSwSEYhR4,3386480,3392720,to 16th all the time  and once again  you've got some opportunities when kalia
KpbSwSEYhR4,3392720,3398079,copper  is not playing tonight due to the sore  back  and
KpbSwSEYhR4,3398079,3404559,i think the sky has done a really good  job  team-wise of picking up the slack well
KpbSwSEYhR4,3404559,3411599,23 assists they do lead the league in  assists per game and their 23 assists  puts them right at their average this
KpbSwSEYhR4,3411599,3417359,year  and a good defensive possession  not great coming out of that timeout
KpbSwSEYhR4,3417359,3423839,from minnesota  candace parker blew that play up  shepard was at the top of the key
KpbSwSEYhR4,3423839,3429200,candice got all over her  let's get that reaction yeah
KpbSwSEYhR4,3429200,3434240,not feeling good about her team's effort  right now it's the turnovers that really  gunned them in lisa because they're
KpbSwSEYhR4,3434240,3440640,still shooting 60 from the field are the  links  right  you're right
KpbSwSEYhR4,3440640,3446400,so the turnovers have done them in  well you're absolutely right 27 points
KpbSwSEYhR4,3446400,3453200,off of 18 turnovers the sky have tried  to take advantage in that category
KpbSwSEYhR4,3453200,3457400,resulted in a 10-point edge
KpbSwSEYhR4,3469040,3474960,caught in like no person's territory and  she walked with it there on the baseline  my pops always said if you're going to
KpbSwSEYhR4,3474960,3480400,go in the air know what you're going to  do with it  say it again my pops my dad was my high
KpbSwSEYhR4,3480400,3486799,school basketball coach he always said  if you go in the air make sure you know  what you're going to do with it i had to  let the people at home here twice
KpbSwSEYhR4,3486799,3492640,because it was so good  bob byington doing it
KpbSwSEYhR4,3492640,3498480,dropping that wisdom  you know what i mean don't give him too  much

KpbSwSEYhR4,3520860,3527119,[Applause]  that's beautiful basketball the game of  it this game is simple
KpbSwSEYhR4,3527119,3533359,and you really see it when you see  players like slooty and candace parker  hook up and make it look simple salute
KpbSwSEYhR4,3533359,3538400,averages just under seven assists per  game she's at six assists right now
KpbSwSEYhR4,3538400,3545839,and parker's in double figures with 11  after that bucket  shepard taking that right at cp3 drawing

KpbSwSEYhR4,3552480,3559040,hold the fourth down for the links and  go back and  take a look look at three defenders that  slooty draws to her
KpbSwSEYhR4,3559040,3564640,and candice has the ability to shoot a  practice three meaning no defense in  sight
KpbSwSEYhR4,3564640,3571200,josh sheppard taking the minutes of  damaris dantas who started the game jeff  shepherd started the second half here
