KkAiXzKOTNY,160,6720,don't you hate it  when you shell out extra money  to get a worse experience
KkAiXzKOTNY,6720,12559,well honestly that's how i've felt about  these and bright and smart motion  dimmers because ge in their infinite
KkAiXzKOTNY,12559,19199,wisdom ships them out of the box with  all of the motion sensors not only  active but
KkAiXzKOTNY,19199,26320,instantly active so you can run into  situations see that where you go to turn  off the light walk away from it and as
KkAiXzKOTNY,26320,33440,you're moving away the bloody thing  turns back on because and this is a  feature not a bug they have a 180
KkAiXzKOTNY,33440,41200,degree motion sensing radius  thankfully because these are z-wave  devices we have the solution we should
KkAiXzKOTNY,41200,46399,by the end of this video be able to  reconfigure these smart switches to  disable the fade on and off
KkAiXzKOTNY,46399,52879,functionality that i personally find  kind of annoying set up remote control  including voice control create groupings
KkAiXzKOTNY,52879,60559,so that multiple zones can be turned on  and off at the same time with a single  command and decouple the motion sensing
KkAiXzKOTNY,60559,66000,from the light switch functionality so  that it could potentially be used for  other automations and
KkAiXzKOTNY,66000,71920,not for the lights in areas where that  would be pretty annoying like the  bedroom  you know you roll over to get more
KkAiXzKOTNY,71920,78000,comfortable  light goes on it's not great i've had to  paper over every bedroom light switch
KkAiXzKOTNY,78000,84720,just like i'm papering over this segway  to our sponsor zoho desk over 50 000  businesses worldwide trust zoho's

KkAiXzKOTNY,98550,104720,[Music]  our story begins today in the server
KkAiXzKOTNY,104720,110479,room where these motion sensing light  switches have actually been amazing  there are parts of the house where i'm  not going to want to disable that
KkAiXzKOTNY,110479,117840,functionality like  bathrooms hallways and utility spaces  like this one and the garage but we
KkAiXzKOTNY,117840,124159,definitely need to fine-tune the  behavior a little bit because the way it  is now where it only stays on for a
KkAiXzKOTNY,124159,129280,couple of minutes and then the second it  turns off it's active again means that i
KkAiXzKOTNY,129280,136560,will oftentimes try to turn off the  light and in walking away from it have  the bloody thing turn back on it's a
KkAiXzKOTNY,136560,142480,motion sensor you don't have to shut it  off  fortunately  jake has the solution and it is a
KkAiXzKOTNY,142480,147920,raspberry pi where did it go i have no  idea i've been trying to find it where  did you put it you moved it i didn't
KkAiXzKOTNY,147920,153760,move it it was just chilling here he is  such a liar yeah but it was something it  was still like here no you moved it you
KkAiXzKOTNY,153760,160080,used a different oh i know it's in the  land center hopefully
KkAiXzKOTNY,160080,167680,ah there it is i should know that  because i put it there now the role of a  raspberry pi in this situation is just a
KkAiXzKOTNY,167680,173519,stand-in to run home assistant which is  like the piece of software that's going  to tell hey light switch do that thing
KkAiXzKOTNY,173519,179519,other light switch do that thing air  conditioner do that yeah light switches  work together the intention long term is
KkAiXzKOTNY,179519,185760,for that to go on your nas as like a  docker container or something uh  sort of it runs as a vm because it runs
KkAiXzKOTNY,185760,191120,its own docker containers that's like  the plugins and hosts it's pretty cool  mind blown but for now it's on a
KkAiXzKOTNY,191120,197200,raspberry pi i can't connect to it  though for some reason  did you unplug anything in there
KkAiXzKOTNY,197200,204239,not that i know hey look we're in  business  nice we actually have one device already  adopted and it's that one oh that's why
KkAiXzKOTNY,204239,213599,that one doesn't dim on and off did you  change it no that's just because this  light fixture doesn't dim oh  but we can go in here here look at this
KkAiXzKOTNY,213599,218640,there's like no delay that's actually  pretty awesome there's a vacancy mode so  i guess you can turn on the light when
KkAiXzKOTNY,218640,223680,somebody leaves that doesn't make sense  you would want it on
KkAiXzKOTNY,223680,229840,when nobody's there no motion there's  clearly a lot for us to learn about  these i'm glad we bought a hundred of
KkAiXzKOTNY,229840,235360,them  let's go vacancy mode
KkAiXzKOTNY,235360,241360,okay  okay  let's walk out
KkAiXzKOTNY,241360,246480,here we go and then so what  theoretically in five seconds it'll turn  on
KkAiXzKOTNY,246480,251599,something like that  nope  okay well definitely more research
KkAiXzKOTNY,251599,257519,required into what that value does what  else we got here  enable and disable whether motion sensor
KkAiXzKOTNY,257519,262799,only turns on if the room is dark  oh
KkAiXzKOTNY,262800,269759,see i was in the bathroom yeah and i was  thinking jake remember how i was like  hey we should make it so that it's tied
KkAiXzKOTNY,269759,276800,into a light sensor outside or the time  of day and hold on hold on and if i  press the switch it actually opens up a
KkAiXzKOTNY,276800,282160,smart blind instead of turning on the  light  but this is a way simpler way to do that
KkAiXzKOTNY,282160,287199,yeah so basically you would just have  like in the bathrooms probably if it's  the middle of the day and the blinds are
KkAiXzKOTNY,287199,293360,open and it's like searingly bright you  don't need to turn the light on oh  that's great yeah  you can oh invert switch so if you in
KkAiXzKOTNY,293360,301360,case they installed them upside down  it's too late no no no no no no no no no  no it's for three-way switches  well there's a three-way right here
KkAiXzKOTNY,302080,310000,yeah i got the other side of this  where's the main is this the main theme  wait what yes it is well there's there's
KkAiXzKOTNY,310000,316240,three light switches within  one two three four five steps
KkAiXzKOTNY,316240,322320,for the same lights  why don't we adopt this switch  okay or why don't we do the theater room
KkAiXzKOTNY,322320,328479,first because that's the one that's been  bothering me the most because the lights  just turn on in the middle of a movie  i've had to tape over those ones i'm
KkAiXzKOTNY,328479,334080,pretty sure when i start the inclusion  all you have to do is click the light  switch okay which one are you gonna do
KkAiXzKOTNY,334080,341039,i'm gonna do the overhead one not the  sconces okay so i'll set the location to  theater room oh theater room overhead oh
KkAiXzKOTNY,341039,347759,this will be overhead yeah there you go  seriously i can't believe how fast that  is z-wave is great and especially once
KkAiXzKOTNY,347759,353280,we have like 100 150 devices yeah it  will work really well now what we're  probably gonna have to do is once
KkAiXzKOTNY,353280,358560,they're all adopted we're gonna have to  go and say heal the network which  basically tells every single device to
KkAiXzKOTNY,358560,365360,find the best routes to other devices  and with that many devices it might take  like a day to do shut up i don't know i
KkAiXzKOTNY,365360,372319,haven't tried it i know at my house with  like five or ten devices it takes like  10 minutes so oh wow okay it could take
KkAiXzKOTNY,372319,377919,a while let's see if it scales linearly  or exponentially but you only have to do  that once with the motion sensitivity
KkAiXzKOTNY,377919,383840,low  could i make my way back to my seat  no
KkAiXzKOTNY,383840,391759,okay then  vacancy light turns on manually and off  automatically without motion oh
KkAiXzKOTNY,391759,396880,okay hold on if we turn off one of these  yeah  maybe the reset level like figured
KkAiXzKOTNY,396880,404080,itself out now  nope frick  that's kind of a problem you only spent
KkAiXzKOTNY,404080,409599,ten thousand dollars on these light  switches  okay uh tell me the name of the switch  dan
KkAiXzKOTNY,409599,416720,let's go rec room  okay rec room get wrecked  okay uh can you hit the rec room switch
KkAiXzKOTNY,416720,422000,please whatever one you hit oh crap that  one uh what did you press stairs yeah so
KkAiXzKOTNY,422000,427280,location what's the location for a stair  basement  yeah but there's two stairs to the
KkAiXzKOTNY,427280,432880,basement  i guess there's basement stairs and  upstairs oh right there's two stairs
KkAiXzKOTNY,432880,438800,on the basement  basement the switch is also up there oh  wait but that's what this wait why did
KkAiXzKOTNY,438800,444160,we put the motion sensor oh i guess that  kind of makes sense switch is in the  basement well no there's supposed to be  a motion on both sides no there isn't
KkAiXzKOTNY,444160,450080,well it's not a thing why not because  it's not a thing what do you mean it's  not it's not a thing that's not how they  keep saying it's not a thing but what do
KkAiXzKOTNY,450080,456240,you mean that's not how they work why  can't you have a motion on both sides i  don't know maybe you could no what are  you talking about because there's two
KkAiXzKOTNY,456240,462639,motions on the uh the one on the in the  hallway over there is there i'm pretty  sure i could be wrong
KkAiXzKOTNY,462639,468560,oh that's a normal one oh okay i wait no  that's the one for these ones
KkAiXzKOTNY,468560,475360,yeah no i'm i'm wrong it's just the one  here wait  yeah this one's the main one i know what
KkAiXzKOTNY,475360,482319,we can do we move the motion sensing one  to the top of the stairs  and then we use the motion sensor from
KkAiXzKOTNY,482319,487520,one of these other spaces where we don't  want motion control right to control
KkAiXzKOTNY,487520,494160,these lights from the bottom of the  stairs  right  uh yeah theoretically
KkAiXzKOTNY,494160,500160,that would be awesome  okay well sure we can do that but for  now for now i need to name this switch
KkAiXzKOTNY,500160,506319,which is so what is it  location rec room stairs  because these are the stairs into the
KkAiXzKOTNY,506319,513039,rec room  oh god
KkAiXzKOTNY,513200,518800,i know these are things that i can  change anytime i want but come on you  guys get this right once you set it
KkAiXzKOTNY,518800,524240,you're never going to touch it again so  there's this pressure to get it right
KkAiXzKOTNY,527519,533279,if i if it's location rec room that's  where it is  and the name is front stairs i think
KkAiXzKOTNY,533279,539839,that's what if you move that switch up  there well then i'll move it  man this  whole turn back on immediately thing is
KkAiXzKOTNY,539839,547360,kind of a problem i've seen online that  apparently there is firmware updates for  these but they release them through like  public hubs like if you had a samsung
KkAiXzKOTNY,547360,554640,like smart things kind of hub  you can get the updates through that but  it doesn't seem like there's a download  site so maybe we can contact them oh
KkAiXzKOTNY,554640,559680,that's so much better the dim though  yeah the speed yeah it's much better
KkAiXzKOTNY,559680,564720,i do wish you could just shut it off but  yeah you can enable plain switch  functionality actually we need to do
KkAiXzKOTNY,564720,571519,that let's go do it my son wanted rgb  lighting in his room which i was like  yeah sure no problem let's just grab
KkAiXzKOTNY,571519,577360,these yeelight v2s that we had kicking  around at the office anyway and we'll  set you up with these
KkAiXzKOTNY,577360,583120,cool right app control you can change  the colors there's there's your sunrise
KkAiXzKOTNY,583120,588480,one small problem  why are you gonna be like that  i had a step stool i was ready to go
KkAiXzKOTNY,588480,595360,where's the other one  uh well it's in there oh yeah because i  wanted to get something working for him  temporarily anyway the point is
KkAiXzKOTNY,595360,601040,he had no work  oh does that bulb work in there though  at all oh yeah
KkAiXzKOTNY,601040,608079,it's pretty typical for you to have to  choose you want smart bulbs or you want  smart switches now i wanted the motion
KkAiXzKOTNY,608079,613279,sensors everywhere because  who knows what kind of  cool things we might want to do with
KkAiXzKOTNY,613279,619200,motion down the line but that doesn't  necessarily mean that i want every  single switch to operate as a smart
KkAiXzKOTNY,619200,624640,switch  so if we set it to dumb switch mode  yeah i think it's gonna work
KkAiXzKOTNY,624640,630800,it's off  no dice  how do you know
KkAiXzKOTNY,630800,636399,time for our classic do as i say not as  i do moment wow if it's hooked up
KkAiXzKOTNY,636399,642320,that's very silly of you theoretically  yes  all of that looks
KkAiXzKOTNY,642320,648000,quite  hooked up what are you doing  i  am fixing it
KkAiXzKOTNY,648000,654320,oh do you know why it's the electrician  said that there's a couple of light  switches that are not working
KkAiXzKOTNY,654320,660320,and he thinks it's because the  apprentice screwed it up i guess i  should probably hit the breaker for this
KkAiXzKOTNY,660320,666000,electricians usually don't  i am not an electrician  ah
KkAiXzKOTNY,666000,672880,oh my gosh  what  what hello giver  full sentence only no i don't want to
KkAiXzKOTNY,672880,678880,break it sounds only bud  oh that sucks  i think i need to take the other one out
KkAiXzKOTNY,678880,684399,too can i steal your that sucks no you  cannot steal my cat should i bring arlo  here i really like my cat you're more
KkAiXzKOTNY,684399,690480,than welcome to bring her  actually  uh yeah so  this is
KkAiXzKOTNY,690480,698320,not right  don't do that  oh  what the actual bananas
KkAiXzKOTNY,698320,704800,so it is hooked up right  i wonder if it just got kind of mangled
KkAiXzKOTNY,704800,711279,when they pushed it in and it just like  broke the copper yeah  whoa  that was not actually an easy place to
KkAiXzKOTNY,711279,716399,catch something  smart guy maybe it doesn't dim anymore  well that's what it should be that's
KkAiXzKOTNY,716399,722560,what we want  right  yeah the dimmer is not working confirmed
KkAiXzKOTNY,722560,727760,cool but it still tries to do the  it still fades on and off  uh
KkAiXzKOTNY,727760,733440,ge  you gotta have a way to disable that  there's lots of bulbs that don't behave
KkAiXzKOTNY,733440,738720,nicely even with  led and cfl compatible dimmers
KkAiXzKOTNY,738720,745040,so then hold on  other than flickering a little bit when  it first turns on is that a problem well
KkAiXzKOTNY,745040,751040,that might cause it to reset every time  you  oh it flickers quite a bit that's true
KkAiXzKOTNY,751040,757440,if you turn this on and off i believe  it's five times it goes into like a  reset state so
KkAiXzKOTNY,757440,763440,let me let's just see let's just see  because oh actually no jake it's not  going to do it the yeelight wants two
KkAiXzKOTNY,763440,768720,seconds in between each change of state  for the reset  so maybe it's fine
KkAiXzKOTNY,768720,776480,oh hey oh oh oh oh okay  is it dimmed right now they turned it up
KkAiXzKOTNY,776480,781600,oh yes  there now we have a regular bulb that  can tell us what the crap the fixture is
KkAiXzKOTNY,781600,787040,doing so it's supposed to be on  okay
KkAiXzKOTNY,787040,792320,here we go  it's not turning off
KkAiXzKOTNY,792320,797920,the switch is clearly not working  wait it turned off
KkAiXzKOTNY,798160,803680,okay the switch is working again okay  there's something very wrong with this  light switch
KkAiXzKOTNY,803680,811519,what is even  happening right now i disabled the  motion sensor so why don't we see if  it's disabled uh sure feel free let's
KkAiXzKOTNY,811519,815839,give it a try expose light switch
KkAiXzKOTNY,822160,827360,okay that is so stupid gee i wonder why  not everyone is
KkAiXzKOTNY,827360,832560,super into smart home stuff  okay manually mode
KkAiXzKOTNY,832560,838800,manually mode or sorry manual mode i'm  looking at the modes  occupancy mode turn on motion detected
KkAiXzKOTNY,838800,845279,turn off  manual mode manual from the front panel  of the in wall smart dimmer
KkAiXzKOTNY,845279,851120,remotely with the uv controller huh did  we manage to disable the motion sensor  on any of them we'll go check that other
KkAiXzKOTNY,851120,858079,one the closet because that one's  okay i'll go check okay  no it's no it's still the motion sensor
KkAiXzKOTNY,858079,865839,is still turning it on  so what happens if they all suck and  that this never works
KkAiXzKOTNY,865839,873040,oh  [Laughter]  okay maybe we should just for
KkAiXzKOTNY,873040,879839,why don't we try and shut the breaker  off and turn it back on maybe it needs a  hard reset i don't know why
KkAiXzKOTNY,879839,885839,but maybe sure okay hold on here's oh we  can't disable the motion
KkAiXzKOTNY,888079,893600,okay if we can't disable the motion  sensor this is really gonna be a problem
KkAiXzKOTNY,893600,899040,we should see if we can turn off the  motion in the one in the mechanical room
KkAiXzKOTNY,899040,906000,are you still down there  yep  okay i'm gonna turn off the motion in  the mechanical room one sure
KkAiXzKOTNY,906000,911440,the motion is  off  really
KkAiXzKOTNY,911440,918399,yeah curiously although that is a  different model of switch the firmware  on that one is 5.39 and the firmware on
KkAiXzKOTNY,918399,923920,all of these motion dimmers is 5.32  so i'm kind of feeling like there was a
KkAiXzKOTNY,923920,930880,bug  and they updated it and i just don't  know how we're gonna get the firmware  for these ones maybe we have to buy a
KkAiXzKOTNY,930880,936800,like a samsung smartthings hub  and just  hook them all up to that so they'll
KkAiXzKOTNY,936800,945040,update this is  terrifying there's a home assistant  thread here about ge jasco switches
KkAiXzKOTNY,945040,951279,where people are just like yeah yeah  it's really bad there's basically no way  to update the firmware
KkAiXzKOTNY,951279,956880,so if anyone in the audience works for  ge or jasco please help us yeah you guys  actually
KkAiXzKOTNY,956880,962000,suck  not releasing firmware updates because  especially
KkAiXzKOTNY,962000,969519,you especially if you make the firmware  and then won't give it to people yeah  like actually you this this thread
KkAiXzKOTNY,969519,975920,just makes me  so angry it's just people complaining  about the same kind of basic stuff that
KkAiXzKOTNY,975920,982480,we want to do like no i just want it to  just immediately switch on or  immediately switch off stuff that like a
KkAiXzKOTNY,982480,987519,good software engineer could do in an  afternoon  also why are we buying inventory with
KkAiXzKOTNY,987519,993519,ancient firmware on it especially for  our product where you can't  update it
KkAiXzKOTNY,993519,999759,okay so garth on live chat says he's  gonna see if he can find something for  us  unbelievable it'll be a lot cheaper for
KkAiXzKOTNY,999759,1005040,them to just  put up a support page with firmware  downloads that would be way cheaper the
KkAiXzKOTNY,1005040,1011519,stupidest thing is that home assistant  even has an interface  for pushing
KkAiXzKOTNY,1011519,1018079,where is it you can shoot firmware  updates to things  yeah there  you just have to select a file
KkAiXzKOTNY,1018079,1026319,and update it  yeah because these guys say his firmware  is 5.54 we're on like 5.32 i know oh no
KkAiXzKOTNY,1026319,1031360,there's way newer firmwares should we  buy  where can we get one of those like smart
KkAiXzKOTNY,1031360,1037520,things  no no that's a bad solution  because then if there's a future update
KkAiXzKOTNY,1037520,1043839,what am i going to do i'm going to  unpair it to the freaking home but you  just don't necessarily need it all 100
KkAiXzKOTNY,1043839,1049039,of them right then i put them all back  on the samsung and reconfigure them no
KkAiXzKOTNY,1049039,1054640,no no no no no no no you provide  firmware updates
KkAiXzKOTNY,1054640,1060000,that's it  i will fly there jake will you i will
KkAiXzKOTNY,1060000,1065280,fly i guess it's a video oh yeah it's  not like they're going to come outside  garth is going to help us out i feel it
KkAiXzKOTNY,1065280,1071039,garth is typing oh garth please garth  come through for us garth help us all
KkAiXzKOTNY,1071039,1076080,there is not really a manual mode  on the switches it should just go ahead
KkAiXzKOTNY,1076080,1081520,and turn the lights on and off  yes there is garth might be an actual
KkAiXzKOTNY,1081520,1088240,npc  okay do they have a phone line we'll let  garth try to help us in the meantime
KkAiXzKOTNY,1091919,1098000,if spanish is what it will take to get a  firmware update out of these guys  we can talk to serge he sort of knows
KkAiXzKOTNY,1098000,1104400,spanish man i can feel my blood pressure  rising  like stuff stuff like this man it just
KkAiXzKOTNY,1104400,1110000,makes me so angry here's an idea  for the ones we don't want to have  motion
KkAiXzKOTNY,1110000,1115760,we could  paint the motion sensor  that's the stupidest thing
KkAiXzKOTNY,1115760,1122559,you've ever heard but it doesn't involve  yeah but the other functionality doesn't  update i know no we actually just need
KkAiXzKOTNY,1122559,1128960,them to work i know i know since we're  on the subject of things that make me  angry if you've got hold music
KkAiXzKOTNY,1128960,1134720,fine have hold music  never have a pre-recorded voice come  back and say
KkAiXzKOTNY,1134720,1141760,hi are you okay to still be holding  right now or whatever the it's  saying  because i'm like oh what what no it's
KkAiXzKOTNY,1141760,1146960,that again  just have music so that i know when to
KkAiXzKOTNY,1146960,1152240,come back to it this is the soundtrack  of my personal hell
KkAiXzKOTNY,1154320,1160960,after four of my yes i'm here garth has  said he's still here he's just waiting  for a reply because he has no idea
KkAiXzKOTNY,1160960,1167360,clearly because it's so stupid  how has nobody ever how is this not just
KkAiXzKOTNY,1167360,1174160,like something they deal with every  other day yeah that i don't really  understand ltgstore.com
KkAiXzKOTNY,1174160,1180960,buy a few water bottles so he can pay  for this disaster  it's a lot of water bottles please all
KkAiXzKOTNY,1180960,1186400,right and how can i assist you today  i have some ge and brighton
KkAiXzKOTNY,1186400,1192400,switches  and  basically they're running a mishmash of  different firmwares
KkAiXzKOTNY,1192400,1200080,and there's no obvious way to update the  firmware  okay  so the firmware on the devices is
KkAiXzKOTNY,1200080,1205600,updated through your hub  there isn't any out
KkAiXzKOTNY,1205600,1213520,way of updating the firmware other than  with the hub  right so i'm using a uh a home assistant
KkAiXzKOTNY,1213520,1220799,server to run it so i need the firmware  file so that i can upload it to the  switch okay so unfortunately we don't
KkAiXzKOTNY,1220799,1226799,give out that information it's all done  through the hub  right so that's my hub and that's the
KkAiXzKOTNY,1226799,1232159,way that my hub requires it to be done  this it's my device like i bought it i  need the firmware file for it
KkAiXzKOTNY,1232159,1239600,we don't have those available  okay so then what your hub support  your hub support
KkAiXzKOTNY,1239600,1245760,would do that okay so hold on so do do  you guys are this is jasco right
KkAiXzKOTNY,1245760,1253039,that is correct okay so you guys make  the switch for ge  that is correct including the firmware
KkAiXzKOTNY,1253039,1260640,that is correct cool okay so that  firmware i need it  again unfortunately no it's not fortune
KkAiXzKOTNY,1260640,1266640,you no no i don't want you to use the  word unfortunately because it's not  fortune this is not chance
KkAiXzKOTNY,1266640,1271840,this is  you guys deciding  not to provide a customer for your
KkAiXzKOTNY,1271840,1277120,product with a firmware update when the  functionality of it is fundamentally
KkAiXzKOTNY,1277120,1282400,broken right now i can't even disable  the motion sensors on these things
KkAiXzKOTNY,1282400,1290559,so what i need is  to unfortunately  you guys send me the firmware files
KkAiXzKOTNY,1290559,1298559,so am i able to get the firmware from  aotech because they're the ones who make  the z-wave stick that i'm using
KkAiXzKOTNY,1298559,1305039,yes that is who you would get a hold of  why  because they are the ones that the uh
KkAiXzKOTNY,1305039,1310400,evidently if you've got an aotec stick  then they are the ones that would have
KkAiXzKOTNY,1310400,1316240,the support to be able to update or uh  change your firmware
KkAiXzKOTNY,1316240,1321440,but you guys make the switch  that is correct and you guys write the  firmware
KkAiXzKOTNY,1321440,1328080,that is correct but we do not give it  out  that is a proprietary information that
KkAiXzKOTNY,1328080,1334720,is only handed out through the hub  well that's the stupidest thing i've  ever heard in my life thank you very
KkAiXzKOTNY,1334720,1340880,much you're very welcome  jasco
KkAiXzKOTNY,1340880,1346159,you  so i emailed aotech it's possible they
KkAiXzKOTNY,1346159,1353039,might be able to save the day garth  could still come through for us garth's  not gonna come through clearly their  policy is to withhold
KkAiXzKOTNY,1353039,1358480,critical  updates from their customers  no it's not
KkAiXzKOTNY,1358480,1364240,unbelievable where's the okay he said  try pushing the configuration button  with the on and off button at the same
KkAiXzKOTNY,1364240,1370240,time  where is the configuration what the hell  is he talking about i mean if this puts  it in manual mode this will at least
KkAiXzKOTNY,1370240,1377120,solve the problem for now oh my god that  is not the solution though well i agree  i'm just saying if it works right now
KkAiXzKOTNY,1377120,1384000,yeah i found it jake it's right here  yeah that's why i was clicking but it's  not working  they want you to take every wall plate
KkAiXzKOTNY,1384000,1390720,off to do this  i seriously don't remember the last time  okay there we go enraged
KkAiXzKOTNY,1390720,1398240,it blinked three times  holy it worked i know i know it's awful
KkAiXzKOTNY,1398240,1405360,you don't need to do it on all of them  but for now at least  i can go around and take the plates off
KkAiXzKOTNY,1405360,1410640,every switch in the house that i want  running in manual mode i'm not saying  it's a good thing i'm just trying to
KkAiXzKOTNY,1410640,1417200,help you for now  until aotech will come save the day  faster to put tape over top
KkAiXzKOTNY,1417200,1422480,this video was supposed to be  hey g and brighton switches by jasco
KkAiXzKOTNY,1422480,1428960,cool product we'd love to use it and  show how cool it is it turned into you  can go yourself like honestly i
KkAiXzKOTNY,1428960,1434240,just want to rip every single one of  them out of the wall regardless  as someone who bought this product and
KkAiXzKOTNY,1434240,1441760,went and installed it in my home  my recourse is someone in some other   time zone when jasco has the
KkAiXzKOTNY,1441760,1447760,firmware but it's just like we won't get  it no no no no no no we won't give it to  you
KkAiXzKOTNY,1447760,1454880,no  oh  my god  oh my god what you know what garth just
KkAiXzKOTNY,1454880,1459919,told me i asked him where can we find  the rest of these config options like  holding the switch
KkAiXzKOTNY,1459919,1468559,he found them on youtube  this is literally their customer service
KkAiXzKOTNY,1468559,1475039,this is just a basic product overview  why were we expecting garth to save the
KkAiXzKOTNY,1475039,1481679,day exactly firmware is updated through  the hub so you may contact them to see  if it's updated oh my god no firmware is
KkAiXzKOTNY,1481679,1486799,updated through you having a firmware  download page  to what end
KkAiXzKOTNY,1486799,1492000,jasco to what end  what what are you trying to accomplish
KkAiXzKOTNY,1492000,1497360,they don't want their proprietary z-wave  firmware stolen you know it's very
KkAiXzKOTNY,1497360,1502640,high-tech by who definitely not an open  standard my question is if aeo tech is
KkAiXzKOTNY,1502640,1508640,supposed to have the firmware updates  then shouldn't they just propagate well  because i don't think the stick is is
KkAiXzKOTNY,1508640,1515840,meant to push firmware updates or you  just mean aotech makes a hub so they  might be able to provide it um the stick
KkAiXzKOTNY,1515840,1521679,is the diy approach right yeah it just  allows you to integrate z-wave with  whatever thing in this instance we're
KkAiXzKOTNY,1521679,1528559,integrating with home assistant right  they also make a hub so i'm thinking  maybe if jasco just gives them the
KkAiXzKOTNY,1528559,1535679,firmware to distribute it maybe they  just have it and they can just give it  to us to update with its e-stick well if  jasco won't send out the firmware to the
KkAiXzKOTNY,1535679,1541200,public then i'm sure whatever agreement  they have with aotech doesn't allow them  to send it out to the public i also said
KkAiXzKOTNY,1541200,1547120,as an alternative option they could send  us a hub to see but that is i know i  would rather take them out i'd rather
KkAiXzKOTNY,1547120,1552640,take them out put them in a box and fly  to jasco's hq and throw them in their  face honestly
KkAiXzKOTNY,1552640,1558240,i think all we can really do is say to  be continued ladies and gentlemen  at the end of that day i was
KkAiXzKOTNY,1558240,1564799,understandably very frustrated i just  spent ten thousand dollars on product  alone switches that we could not
KkAiXzKOTNY,1564799,1571600,reliably put in manual mode adjust the  motion cooldown of or disable the fade  in and fade out on adding insult to
KkAiXzKOTNY,1571600,1578080,injury they outright refused to provide  any firmware updates that at the time we  believed could have solved my problems
KkAiXzKOTNY,1578080,1583679,which is an enormous no-no in my books  i shared the experiences that both
KkAiXzKOTNY,1583679,1589679,myself and others in the smart home  community had gone through on the wan  show and to our surprise
KkAiXzKOTNY,1589679,1596000,jasco actually reached out pretty much  immediately so we pushed for them to  provide firmware update files not just
KkAiXzKOTNY,1596000,1601120,for us but also to the rest of the  community after a few emails back and  forth we ended up on the phone with some
KkAiXzKOTNY,1601120,1607760,of the higher-ups at jasco and the  product manager we were speaking with  insisted that version 5.50
KkAiXzKOTNY,1607760,1614159,is the only firmware they've ever  released for the motion dimmer which was  very confusing to me because as you
KkAiXzKOTNY,1614159,1619840,might recall our switches reported  version 5.32  they eventually figured out that when
KkAiXzKOTNY,1619840,1626880,the motion dimmer was submitted for  certification to the z-wave alliance  they had accidentally entered the  firmware version in decimal form when
KkAiXzKOTNY,1626880,1632960,the form asked for hexadecimal this  means the 32 of 5.32 got converted from
KkAiXzKOTNY,1632960,1639039,hex to decimal as 50.  that means my switches were indeed on
KkAiXzKOTNY,1639039,1644159,the latest firmware which meant there  had to be something else going on or the
KkAiXzKOTNY,1644159,1651200,original firmware was just buggy  now within a z-wave network when you  adopt or include a device it's given a
KkAiXzKOTNY,1651200,1657279,unique id number starting from one and  what we found was that when adopting  more of the switches
KkAiXzKOTNY,1657279,1662880,certain switches would adopt the same  device id as another existing switch
KkAiXzKOTNY,1662880,1669919,and in turn z-wave js the application  that runs within home assistant to  manage the network would crash and after
KkAiXzKOTNY,1669919,1677200,a reboot only the originally adopted  switch would show in the list  so in the video we were trying to edit
KkAiXzKOTNY,1677200,1682399,the configuration of a switch in my  son's bedroom as it turns out that
KkAiXzKOTNY,1682399,1688080,switch had the same id as one downstairs  in the rec room hallway
KkAiXzKOTNY,1688080,1694080,as you might have guessed these  configuration changes were actually  applying to the downstairs switch
KkAiXzKOTNY,1694080,1700000,instead  even though we hadn't yet adopted it  into the network we don't know exactly
KkAiXzKOTNY,1700000,1706000,why this was happening but apparently  weird issues like this were common in  the earlier days of z-wave and since
KkAiXzKOTNY,1706000,1712000,these switches are based on a  several-year-old design i think they  said six  it could explain why they're
KkAiXzKOTNY,1712000,1718000,particularly prone to it after we  realized this we were able to exclude  both of those switches then re-adopt
KkAiXzKOTNY,1718000,1724320,them one by one and we were finally able  to disable the motion sensors with that  said we still can't disable the fade in
KkAiXzKOTNY,1724320,1730000,and out or tweak the motion cooldown so  maybe new firmware is actually needed or
KkAiXzKOTNY,1730000,1736799,maybe i'll still need to switch to a  different solution  first we need to talk about the elephant  in the room firmware updates
KkAiXzKOTNY,1736799,1743600,for a product like this especially in an  industry that's changing so rapidly  being able to update your firmware is a
KkAiXzKOTNY,1743600,1750159,huge deal and no  go through your hub's proprietary update  system that your hub might not even have
KkAiXzKOTNY,1750159,1756159,because it's actually a stick and not a  hub is not an appropriate answer for a  product that is designed to be used in
KkAiXzKOTNY,1756159,1763520,an open ecosystem so in my call with  jasco they said they would provide me  with the firmware files and figure out a
KkAiXzKOTNY,1763520,1770480,solution for sharing them publicly and  i'm happy to report that as of just two  weeks from sharing my issues jasco has
KkAiXzKOTNY,1770480,1776399,already followed through the files for  12 of their most popular products are  now available on github and on their
KkAiXzKOTNY,1776399,1781840,support site with the rest to follow  shortly so  we did it read it and also thank you
KkAiXzKOTNY,1781840,1787760,jasco for taking my  admittedly not very level-headed  criticism
KkAiXzKOTNY,1787760,1793520,and turning it into a w as for what's  going to happen with my house  that's still up in the air if we can't
KkAiXzKOTNY,1793520,1800640,fix the above-mentioned remaining issues  with the jasco switches i might still  have to pull them out and go with a  different solution innovelli has pitched
KkAiXzKOTNY,1800640,1806080,working with us to develop their own  motion switch and we've also looked into  hardwiring motion sensors actually
KkAiXzKOTNY,1806080,1812240,multi-sensors into each area where we  need motion which would give us a lot of  really cool options for automations let
