7e5SQL_xLN8,7370,12900,when that alarm clock goes off there's  at least 50% of the time where you just
7e5SQL_xLN8,12900,19350,met that soft little pillow is just  caressing your head and you want to stay  there and it takes discipline to go nope
7e5SQL_xLN8,19350,24520,I'm gonna get up out of this bed I'm  going to do what I'm supposed to do we  all have you're probably about 5:00
7e5SQL_xLN8,24520,31410,[Music]  tomorrow morning when that alarm goes  off and you start feeling all the
7e5SQL_xLN8,31410,37800,excuses that come in and that bed is  cozy I know what you're saying I love my  bed too and you then go five four three
7e5SQL_xLN8,37800,44399,two one and you get up that discipline  that you have at that moment you win  that fight that's a big victory and then
7e5SQL_xLN8,44399,49710,that that that pattern will carry out  throughout the day because once you're  up well now let them up I might as well
7e5SQL_xLN8,49710,54750,go work out because I'm already up and I  I feel good that I got up out of bed and  I won that battle let me go win another
7e5SQL_xLN8,54750,60270,back I'm gonna go get it done and that  discipline carries on throughout the day  so now you take that and you you expand
7e5SQL_xLN8,60270,66390,that out over a week in a month and you  end up with more discipline and it  starts with that simple are active yet
7e5SQL_xLN8,66390,72520,not to get  morning I worked out twice before  everyone wakes up so it started off four
7e5SQL_xLN8,72520,78490,o'clock in the morning why let's start  with some of my cardio then I have  breakfast and then I would go to the gym  and then I could work I wake up at 4:30
7e5SQL_xLN8,78490,84820,in the morning just no one else is awake  yet so that gives me the opportunity to  do things that I need to get done kind
7e5SQL_xLN8,84820,90460,of selfishly for myself and the big one  in that category is working out and it  doesn't feel good at 4:30 when you get
7e5SQL_xLN8,90460,97630,up but by the time  7 o'clock rolls around and you've  already worked out you've already gotten  some work done and you've got some time
7e5SQL_xLN8,97630,103570,to say goodbye to your kids before they  go to school it's infinitely better than  sleeping in until 6:45 and you get out
7e5SQL_xLN8,103570,109510,of bed now you're missed your kids going  to school or or whatever you you're not  prepared for the day it's it's awful
7e5SQL_xLN8,109510,116380,wake up at the same time every day  and if you pick that time and you start  waking up at the same time every day  that's very good for you it doesn't have
7e5SQL_xLN8,116380,123250,to be 4:30 it could be 6:30 it could be  7 I don't know what your personal  schedule is find out a time pick it set
7e5SQL_xLN8,123250,130149,it stick to it look everyone has a  problem with time but the day is 24
7e5SQL_xLN8,130149,136180,hours and we sleep six now I know  there's some out there that say oh whoa
7e5SQL_xLN8,136180,142030,whoa whoa  I need eight but I say just sleep a  little faster because the bottom line is
7e5SQL_xLN8,142030,147820,we have six hours of sleep 24 hours are  available so if 18 hours now available
7e5SQL_xLN8,147820,156070,to your work your family your hobbies  and also to learn something new or to do
7e5SQL_xLN8,156070,162489,something new which could easily be that  you want to learn a new language to read  a book every week or where you say I'm
7e5SQL_xLN8,162489,168940,gonna go and reshape my body so you're  gonna go and take this hour out of your  schedule and say I'm gonna train an hour
7e5SQL_xLN8,168940,174100,every day so this is for most people a  huge challenge but it is totally doable
7e5SQL_xLN8,174100,180370,I can tell them because the kind of  things that I did when I came to this  country I mean I went to school almost
7e5SQL_xLN8,180370,185380,working on construction I was working  out my five hours a day I was taking
7e5SQL_xLN8,185380,191020,acting classes from 8 o'clock at night  to 12 midnight I was doing all of those  things
7e5SQL_xLN8,191020,196930,I wanted to make sure that out of the 24  hours of the day that I don't waste one
7e5SQL_xLN8,196930,203170,single hour those hours were too  precious and so they'll just want to  tell people don't give me this thing I
7e5SQL_xLN8,203170,208740,have a difficult time of at the time and  I don't have time for this none of that  you have time you make the time
7e5SQL_xLN8,208740,214630,sometimes even if you're the most highly  motivated person in the world that grind  starts to beat you down a little bit and
7e5SQL_xLN8,214630,220960,that's when you have to stop looking at  the short-term thing because that's not  that's not getting you to get it done  and you got to look okay what is the
7e5SQL_xLN8,220960,228070,long-term goal that I'm looking at what  am I really trying to get done in the  long-term and you say oh you know what  I'm actually waking up today early so I
7e5SQL_xLN8,228070,234940,can be ahead of the curve so I can sell  more of these widgets or whatever so  that I can buy a house and you know what
7e5SQL_xLN8,234940,241090,today matters today matters this  decision that I'm making right now is  that first step it's me taking one
7e5SQL_xLN8,241090,246250,stroke swimming in the right direction  heading towards the shore and if I don't  take this I'm not making any progress
7e5SQL_xLN8,246250,252340,I've been struggling struggling  struggling we still had all the same  problems I don't a lien on the house
7e5SQL_xLN8,252340,257350,still facing bankruptcy he's still  fighting like crazy I was still  unemployed the next morning the alarm
7e5SQL_xLN8,257350,262790,goes off and  I pretended NASA was there it's a
7e5SQL_xLN8,262790,267830,stupidest store I literally went 5 4 3 2  1 I counted out loud and then I stood up
7e5SQL_xLN8,267830,273950,and I'll never forget standing there and  for the first time in 3 months I hadn't
7e5SQL_xLN8,273950,279260,beaten my habit of hitting the snooze  button I couldn't believe it and I
7e5SQL_xLN8,279260,284630,thought wait a minute  counting backwards that is the dumbest  thing I've ever heard in my entire life
7e5SQL_xLN8,284630,290030,well the next morning I used it again  into work the next morning I used it  again and it worked the next morning I
7e5SQL_xLN8,290030,296090,used it again and it worked and then I  started to notice something really  interesting there were moments all day
7e5SQL_xLN8,296090,305180,long all day long just like that  five-second moment in bed where I knew
7e5SQL_xLN8,305180,312800,knowledge what I should do and if I  didn't move within 5 seconds my brain
7e5SQL_xLN8,312800,320630,would step in and talk me out of it  every human being has a five-second  window might even be shorter for you you
7e5SQL_xLN8,320630,326180,have about a five-second window in which  you can move from idea to action before
7e5SQL_xLN8,326180,332930,your brain kicks into full gear and  sabotages any change in behavior because
7e5SQL_xLN8,332930,340010,remember your brain is wired to stop you  from doing things that are uncomfortable  or uncertain or scary it's your job to
7e5SQL_xLN8,340010,346220,learn how to move from those ideas that  could change everything into acting on
7e5SQL_xLN8,346220,351380,them in the smallest moment so how do
7e5SQL_xLN8,351380,364770,you make it how do you overcome the odds  I don't know what to say really three
7e5SQL_xLN8,364770,371849,minutes to the biggest battle of our  professional lives all comes down to
7e5SQL_xLN8,371849,379490,today  we're in Hell right now
7e5SQL_xLN8,379490,385400,believe me  and we can stay here get the [ __ ] kicked
7e5SQL_xLN8,385400,394430,out of us or we can fight our way back  into the light we can climb out of hell
7e5SQL_xLN8,394430,401780,or you could be like me dream a pro  football get hurt dream over find
7e5SQL_xLN8,401780,409960,yourself with just seven bucks in your  pocket so how did I get here by being  the hardest worker in the room
7e5SQL_xLN8,420220,428690,while worthy  and you're able to do something special  that no one else in the world can do are
7e5SQL_xLN8,428690,434010,you ready to go out there and take  what's yours  what's your card for
7e5SQL_xLN8,434010,443409,[Applause]  all of us in life have things we want we
7e5SQL_xLN8,443409,453720,don't get what we want we get what we  have to have we all get what we tolerate
7e5SQL_xLN8,453720,459039,in ourselves and other people but when  you're no longer willing to tolerate
7e5SQL_xLN8,459039,464610,something that's when your life changes  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,464610,470819,everyone in the world has a list of  things they think they should do I
7e5SQL_xLN8,470819,476800,should lose weight I should work out I  should spend more time with my kids I
7e5SQL_xLN8,476800,482889,should work harder I should make more  calls I should I should I should I
7e5SQL_xLN8,482889,488770,should and then you know what people  don't do their shirts and they get mad  at themselves they beat them stuff up
7e5SQL_xLN8,488770,494219,about it  what changes people is when you should
7e5SQL_xLN8,494219,499720,becomes a bust  when suddenly the thing you said should
7e5SQL_xLN8,499720,506400,happen has to happen that's when you  redeems change  it's like if you want to take the island
7e5SQL_xLN8,506400,513479,and you're the head of the army if you  want to take the island the most  probable way to take the island is burn  the boats because if there's no way to
7e5SQL_xLN8,513479,521799,go back it's amazing what happens when  it's a must to be something versus or  should that's what makes you in succeed
7e5SQL_xLN8,521799,527019,[Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,527019,533600,ego is the success inhibitor you have to  do your best not to make decisions based
7e5SQL_xLN8,533600,543860,off of ego for sure success and failure  are generally slow processes either
7e5SQL_xLN8,543860,549160,slowly building things up or gradually
7e5SQL_xLN8,549160,557959,tearing them down  and that's why I say you've got to pay
7e5SQL_xLN8,557959,564420,attention  [Music]  you have to watch you have to watch
7e5SQL_xLN8,564420,569220,every single second
7e5SQL_xLN8,571270,577570,because those seconds  they turn into minutes
7e5SQL_xLN8,577570,584730,then minutes turn into hours and hours  turn into days and days turn in
7e5SQL_xLN8,584730,589960,two years  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,590370,595889,and so that second that second that just
7e5SQL_xLN8,595889,604200,went by that guilted  until the backside and so did that one
7e5SQL_xLN8,604200,612170,and even those precious seconds  you're either building
7e5SQL_xLN8,612480,619840,or you are decaying you are either  gaining ground  [Applause]
7e5SQL_xLN8,619840,625589,you loser  in that second
7e5SQL_xLN8,626800,636140,second  every second counts
7e5SQL_xLN8,638030,645889,so  second
7e5SQL_xLN8,645950,652519,the dreams shattered sent home with  seven bucks in my pocket I was like wait  no I gotta play in the NFL eventually
7e5SQL_xLN8,652519,659779,those are my big goals that's my dream  you realize that that playing in the NFL  was the best thing that never happened
7e5SQL_xLN8,659779,666410,because it got me here so my point is  look you're gonna get your ass kicked  we're gonna get the [ __ ] kicked out of  us you got to get up you got to have
7e5SQL_xLN8,666410,673940,faith that the one thing you want it to  happen oftentimes is the best thing that  never happened so have faith just keep
7e5SQL_xLN8,673940,680049,that in mind and keep plugging away  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,686970,694240,it's another early morning every morning  every day of our lives we have choices
7e5SQL_xLN8,694240,700389,to make you have the choice to stay in  bed to say forget it I'm not gonna work
7e5SQL_xLN8,700389,705850,out today or forget it I'm not gonna  work hard today you always have a choice
7e5SQL_xLN8,705850,712600,every single day of your life tell them  today no one cares what you hear

7e5SQL_xLN8,733930,741040,so I'm making the choice again to put my  shoes on early morning and get active
7e5SQL_xLN8,741040,748209,again make the right decision well some
7e5SQL_xLN8,748209,755350,of you read that I think about when it's  hot outside that it's sunny and 70 well
7e5SQL_xLN8,755350,762850,it's [ __ ] not today it's the reality  if it's about 90 degrees the husband  said humidity who gives a [ __ ] that
7e5SQL_xLN8,762850,768939,being said September 3rd I have to have  my book turned in and when I realized
7e5SQL_xLN8,768939,777130,I'm reading this book a lot but I  realized I wasn't boring this  [ __ ] I made them at the bottom
7e5SQL_xLN8,777130,785020,of insecurities fear self-doubt lies was  me buried in the [ __ ] field position
7e5SQL_xLN8,785020,791110,how about got out of that was recognized  being honest with it being truthful with
7e5SQL_xLN8,791110,796390,it and then fixing it we like to live on  social media with lies about ourselves
7e5SQL_xLN8,796390,802950,how great we are get to the source and  fix the problem
7e5SQL_xLN8,805740,814560,[Music]  I'm a big believer in doing something  that sucks every single day in your life
7e5SQL_xLN8,814560,821100,I believe is the key component and to  strengthening your mind every day you
7e5SQL_xLN8,821100,827089,try to find more and put your kid full  of that's the big question
7e5SQL_xLN8,827089,832840,what are you capable of  stop doing the things that should do
7e5SQL_xLN8,832840,838830,every day right every day go swim
7e5SQL_xLN8,841990,849360,let me tell winter for mine  go deputy go something jump my bot cows
7e5SQL_xLN8,849360,854029,in the mind do something that sucks
7e5SQL_xLN8,858610,864369,don't get it twisted now about flipping  tires I'm in Las Vegas right now and
7e5SQL_xLN8,864369,870459,it's hot as [ __ ] it's not about any of  that but what it is about is a lot of us
7e5SQL_xLN8,870459,875829,give total control to life we don't have
7e5SQL_xLN8,875829,881840,any control of it we just give all  control in life I do this [ __ ] every  morning
7e5SQL_xLN8,881840,888829,to prepare my mind  a healthy body usually healthy mind
7e5SQL_xLN8,888829,898279,that's what it's about so it's not bad
7e5SQL_xLN8,898279,906470,for a long run and grab realize for  myself with a lot of people is that life
7e5SQL_xLN8,906470,912290,it's one big tug of war between  mediocrity and trying to find your best
7e5SQL_xLN8,912290,918679,self  so there's tricks to all this crap in  life why does one think hey get one
7e5SQL_xLN8,918679,923959,trick in this situation is so I didn't  want to run so what I do I figure out a
7e5SQL_xLN8,923959,931040,couple of things yet that sometimes men  let me do I could you think that you're  giving in to it so I said you know what
7e5SQL_xLN8,931040,937339,instead of going for a twenty mile or so  go out for an easy six or seven what
7e5SQL_xLN8,937339,944779,that did that my brain was I said okay  mediocrity thought it one so let loose a  little bit and let go of that oh and she
7e5SQL_xLN8,944779,952939,goes suck this could be okay it's not  too bad the second should get to mile to  guess what happens greatness pulls
7e5SQL_xLN8,952939,960589,mediocrity in the [ __ ] mud get out  there and get after him you're not going
7e5SQL_xLN8,960589,967009,about the right mindset the right gear  and combat you wear body armor but what
7e5SQL_xLN8,967009,972499,we do wrong it's really strengthen their  minds you got strength your mind take
7e5SQL_xLN8,972499,979720,control of that so then when you get out  in the real world  and then [ __ ] you up you got protection
7e5SQL_xLN8,979720,986060,some about fifteen miles from home and I  I often talk about taking souls

7e5SQL_xLN8,1310879,1317869,gazelle and the gazelle sees the lion  both these scenes ever the exact same  time when the gazelle sees the lion
7e5SQL_xLN8,1317869,1327179,because of high wire he automatically  fear takes over  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,1327179,1336669,you like so  show time the hunt is on is where I was  made for do the work do the [ __ ] work
7e5SQL_xLN8,1336669,1342489,a lot of people say I just want to sort  of their God a bling in the idea of  improving themselves and the real way to
7e5SQL_xLN8,1342489,1348190,do it is you got to write down what the  [ __ ] you want and then go after if you  decide I'm gonna get down to Bank I'm
7e5SQL_xLN8,1348190,1354399,gonna do this I'm gonna run a marathon  in less than five hours I'm gonna you  know whatever the [ __ ] it is you got to
7e5SQL_xLN8,1354399,1361570,write that [ __ ] down and go for it  well my workout I scheduled every Sunday
7e5SQL_xLN8,1361570,1367239,I scheduled everything that I'm gonna do  during the week I say I have to do yoga  two times this week I have to lift
7e5SQL_xLN8,1367239,1373779,weights three times this week I have to  run twice this week and however I fit  that in I fit it in but I owe those
7e5SQL_xLN8,1373779,1379269,things and you don't need two and a half
7e5SQL_xLN8,1379269,1385479,hours you can get a great workout in 40  minutes and that's all you need for the  whole day 100% you know this idea of
7e5SQL_xLN8,1385479,1391690,time like how much time did you put in  today one you could work out in a  [ __ ] manner for two hours and not
7e5SQL_xLN8,1391690,1396849,get nearly as much done as you can for a  half hour hard just running so I have to
7e5SQL_xLN8,1396849,1407490,get those things and the only exceptions  are injuries and sickness  I do everything that I can to put my
7e5SQL_xLN8,1407490,1413100,body and my brain in a good place so  that I'm keeping my engine smooth I'm
7e5SQL_xLN8,1413100,1420270,changing my oil  I'm changing my spark plugs I'm making  sure that it's operating I mean it's not  gonna be perfect but yeah I know that
7e5SQL_xLN8,1420270,1426540,I've done my best to keep it working the  best that they can there's consequences  that you pay to constantly seeking
7e5SQL_xLN8,1426540,1431970,comfort and and avoiding discomfort and  avoiding art work and those consequences  are you're never gonna feel
7e5SQL_xLN8,1431970,1439680,self-realized you're never gonna feel  like you accomplished anything you're  never gonna have this feeling of  understanding that difficulty and
7e5SQL_xLN8,1439680,1445950,struggle and and the ability to push  through that is a muscle and you develop  that muscle but I'm doing it and once
7e5SQL_xLN8,1445950,1451140,you do you develop a lot of  self-satisfaction and you develop peace  of mind and you you understand that you
7e5SQL_xLN8,1451140,1456240,can overcome obstacles if you don't have  to overcome obstacles you never know  whether or not you can unless you are
7e5SQL_xLN8,1456240,1461640,faced with actual adversity you don't  understand how you're gonna feel and how  you're gonna react when you overcome
7e5SQL_xLN8,1461640,1468870,that adversity things that are difficult  when you do these difficult things  you're stressing your mind or I just
7e5SQL_xLN8,1468870,1474300,don't stress in your mind who exercise  in your mind and exercise your body's
7e5SQL_xLN8,1474300,1483270,ability to manage intense situations  it's hard it's very difficult it's very  testing and in doing so you you lessen
7e5SQL_xLN8,1483270,1490470,the stress of regular life  the more stressful situations that I  experience the more I understand what
7e5SQL_xLN8,1490470,1497670,they are and the more I can relax but
7e5SQL_xLN8,1497670,1503280,it's also like the matter of constantly  being exposed to these stressful
7e5SQL_xLN8,1503280,1510210,situations where there's not a long  break in between doing stand-up or a  long break in between martial arts
7e5SQL_xLN8,1510210,1516390,training we're to the point where  anxiety can build up and then once you  get into it it's almost an it's an
7e5SQL_xLN8,1516390,1524910,unusual situation instead of an unusual  one what I tell people is the best  advice I've ever heard the best advice I
7e5SQL_xLN8,1524910,1530910,ever came up with is that live your life  like you're the hero in your movie and  right now is when the [ __ ] movie
7e5SQL_xLN8,1530910,1537660,starts and your life is a [ __ ] bag  disaster pretend you are right now you  are in the part of the movie that starts
7e5SQL_xLN8,1537660,1543260,and it shows you as a [ __ ] loser and  just decide not to be a loser  live your life like this is a
7e5SQL_xLN8,1543260,1548970,documentary  following you around  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,1548970,1555750,what to do so they're kids one day would  look back at it and see that documentary  and look on it with pride like wow my
7e5SQL_xLN8,1555750,1562590,dad was a bad [ __ ] he really did  what he had to do Wow my mom really got  her [ __ ] together I love a success story
7e5SQL_xLN8,1562590,1568740,but even more than a success story I  like a dude who [ __ ] his life up and  then gets it back together again story
7e5SQL_xLN8,1568740,1575370,those are my favorite stories and the  way to do that you got to write [ __ ]  down  you're gonna think that you are the hero
7e5SQL_xLN8,1575370,1583340,and your own [ __ ] movie and then you  get to sit down and you got a write [ __ ]  down write down what you need to do I
7e5SQL_xLN8,1584360,1592980,was never the most talented never the  flashiest I relied on grit other players
7e5SQL_xLN8,1592980,1598790,might have been more talented but I can  assure you no one was gonna outwork me
7e5SQL_xLN8,1598790,1605100,the secret is in the dirt I learned  early on in my life through many
7e5SQL_xLN8,1605100,1611460,challenges that I could change my  circumstances with hard work you came
7e5SQL_xLN8,1611460,1617540,out really you came out won't me you  came out work me no one will outwork me
7e5SQL_xLN8,1617540,1625230,no one I will not be outworked  right period yeah you know you might
7e5SQL_xLN8,1625230,1630750,have more talent than me you might be  smarter than me you might be sexier than
7e5SQL_xLN8,1630750,1636240,me you might be all of those things you  got it on me in nine categories but
7e5SQL_xLN8,1636240,1645270,sheer concentration that is required to  pursue a dream you see it's not for  everyone but it was for me I yearned for
7e5SQL_xLN8,1645270,1653610,the daily grind and I couldn't get  enough of it 99% of people are not
7e5SQL_xLN8,1653610,1660240,willing to do what it takes to make  their dreams come true  the Marines have a saying everybody
7e5SQL_xLN8,1660240,1667680,wants to go to heaven but nobody wants  to die and that's just real at the  center of bringing any dream into
7e5SQL_xLN8,1667680,1673010,fruition is self discipline self  discipline is
7e5SQL_xLN8,1673010,1679520,center of all material success you  cannot win the war against the world if
7e5SQL_xLN8,1679520,1684650,you can't win the war against your own  mind work that's how you get it the will
7e5SQL_xLN8,1684650,1691010,pay is hard will pay and we put in the  Morgan that's that's what I'm I'm seeing  at the top I poured it all on the line I
7e5SQL_xLN8,1691010,1696020,show up I perform and I get the results  from that that ability to get myself up
7e5SQL_xLN8,1696020,1702470,in the morning no matter how tight I was  uh to push myself through those pain  barriers the bridge between reality and
7e5SQL_xLN8,1702470,1707750,a dream is work a focus on on the work I  show up and I work and I work a network
7e5SQL_xLN8,1707750,1714980,a network everybody wants to be a beast  in terms time to do what bees do you  can't just say you want it you can't
7e5SQL_xLN8,1714980,1722120,watch the video and say I wanted as bad  as I want to breathe its to to say it  but when it's Showtime when the Sun
7e5SQL_xLN8,1722120,1729519,comes up oh you can do it's all you can  do  they nothing more than all you can do
7e5SQL_xLN8,1729519,1735379,that is the absolute maximum you can't  do no more than all you can do you
7e5SQL_xLN8,1735379,1742340,understand that all you can do is all  you can do all you can do is everything
7e5SQL_xLN8,1742340,1749779,that's the absolute ultimate riders all  you can do is all you can do but all you
7e5SQL_xLN8,1749779,1758920,can do is enough  the only thing that you can control that
7e5SQL_xLN8,1758920,1766220,influences success in life is how hard  you work how honest you are and how well
7e5SQL_xLN8,1766220,1773060,you deal with others you can control  those uh variables but less variables it  you can't control how lucky you are
7e5SQL_xLN8,1773060,1780290,although the more you work the luckier  you get you have no influence on the  intellectual capabilities that God did
7e5SQL_xLN8,1780290,1785780,or did not give you but you can work as  hard as possible you can be scrupulously
7e5SQL_xLN8,1785780,1791960,honest so that people respect you and  you can get along with others because  nobody does anything by themselves did
7e5SQL_xLN8,1791960,1797960,you have to pay a price though you  personally well I think that everything  is an either-or you there is a price in
7e5SQL_xLN8,1797960,1804320,everything you can study or you can go  out and play you can defer to others or
7e5SQL_xLN8,1804320,1810830,you can try to hog the credit you can be  honest and suffer the consequences or
7e5SQL_xLN8,1810830,1817130,you can lie cheat and steal and  short-term maybe even advance but  long-term you are better off if you'll
7e5SQL_xLN8,1817130,1822380,work harder you are better off if you're  honest then you are better off if you  give others credit and get them to help
7e5SQL_xLN8,1822380,1828680,you with by helping them  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,1830340,1839700,what makes life powerful and meaningful  and substantive is the expiration date
7e5SQL_xLN8,1840390,1847419,you do what you love doing and you do it  well then everything should sort of fall  into place if we were to live forever we
7e5SQL_xLN8,1847419,1852970,could be slow full and lazy and  indifferent cuz we have forever to get
7e5SQL_xLN8,1852970,1859570,it straight but the fact that the clock  is ticking puts a sense of urgency on
7e5SQL_xLN8,1859570,1866169,each and every one of us and I know you  say well I'm 20 I don't leave you yeah  you do you need to hear that because you
7e5SQL_xLN8,1866169,1875289,won't be twenty long so many of us  choose our path out of fear disguised as  practicality what we really want seems
7e5SQL_xLN8,1875289,1882309,impossibly out of reach and ridiculous  to expect so we never dare to ask the  universe for it I'm saying I'm the proof
7e5SQL_xLN8,1882309,1889809,that you can ask the universe for it in  the few months you'll be 21 and two and
7e5SQL_xLN8,1889809,1895030,three and four and five and it's ticket  on everybody procrastination then
7e5SQL_xLN8,1895030,1900039,becomes an enemy because we cannot  afford to procrastinate with the times
7e5SQL_xLN8,1900039,1905380,that we do not have most of us right now  are looking at where we are with a
7e5SQL_xLN8,1905380,1910960,certain degree of disdain expecting to  have gone further than where we are by
7e5SQL_xLN8,1910960,1917770,now we look back and wonder was I really  a good steward of the time that God gave
7e5SQL_xLN8,1917770,1926300,me imagine if you will be  standing around your veil the ghost of
7e5SQL_xLN8,1926300,1934010,the ideas the dreams the abilities the  talents given to you by lighter than you
7e5SQL_xLN8,1934010,1940580,for whatever reason you never acted on  those ideas you never pursued that dream  you'll never use those talents we never
7e5SQL_xLN8,1940580,1946700,saw your leadership you never use your  voice you never wrote that book and  there they are standing around your bed
7e5SQL_xLN8,1946700,1952700,looking at you with large angry eyes and  we came to you and only you could have
7e5SQL_xLN8,1952700,1960900,given us  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,1960900,1966570,that I really like remise my life and
7e5SQL_xLN8,1966570,1972090,the question is if you die today what
7e5SQL_xLN8,1972090,1977760,idea is what dreams what abilities what
7e5SQL_xLN8,1977760,1985769,talents what gifts will die with you  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,1988390,1994309,the truth of the matter is no matter how  productive you are all of us have been
7e5SQL_xLN8,1994309,2000100,guilty of wasting days and wasting time  and sometimes wasting opportunities
7e5SQL_xLN8,2000100,2007750,along the way  in fact what makes you start to get  wiser as you get older is that as the
7e5SQL_xLN8,2007750,2013780,sands begin to fall more rapidly and you  begin to recognize that you're running
7e5SQL_xLN8,2013780,2020320,out of time you begin to mark certain  things off of your list I'm not gonna  let that worry me I'm not gonna let that
7e5SQL_xLN8,2020320,2025929,worry me this was not important I'm not  going to do that stupid thing again I
7e5SQL_xLN8,2025929,2034570,don't have time to make that mistake  I've got to redeem the time I got to  make it count I cannot mess this up my
7e5SQL_xLN8,2034570,2041710,time becomes more valuable the more it  becomes limited my father could have
7e5SQL_xLN8,2041710,2046890,been a great comedian but he didn't  believe that that was possible for him  and so he made a conservative choice
7e5SQL_xLN8,2046890,2051970,instead he got a safe job as an  accountant and when I was 12 years old
7e5SQL_xLN8,2051970,2058898,he was let go from that safe job and our  family had to do whatever we could to  survive death is the destination we all
7e5SQL_xLN8,2058898,2065378,share no one has ever escaped it and  that is as it should be because death is
7e5SQL_xLN8,2065378,2071108,very likely the single best invention of  life its life's change agent it clears
7e5SQL_xLN8,2071108,2077200,out the old to make way for the new  right now the new is you but some day
7e5SQL_xLN8,2077200,2084310,not too long from now you will gradually  become the old and be cleared away your  time is limited so don't waste it living
7e5SQL_xLN8,2084310,2090310,someone else's life  don't be trapped by Dogma which is  living with the results of other
7e5SQL_xLN8,2090310,2097720,people's thinking don't let the noise of  others opinions drown out your own inner  voice and most important have the
7e5SQL_xLN8,2097720,2104490,courage to follow your heart and  intuition they somehow already know what  you truly want
7e5SQL_xLN8,2104490,2111760,everything else is secondary  I learned many great lessons from my  father not the least of which was that
7e5SQL_xLN8,2111760,2117070,you can fail  so you might as well  a chance on doing what
7e5SQL_xLN8,2117070,2126030,what makes life powerful and meaningful  and substantive is the expiration date
7e5SQL_xLN8,2129750,2135220,how do you keep going why do you keep
7e5SQL_xLN8,2135220,2141070,going when the world says everything
7e5SQL_xLN8,2141070,2146500,else is supposed to be opposite pain is
7e5SQL_xLN8,2146500,2151690,a repetition of the psyche until you
7e5SQL_xLN8,2151690,2158310,learn how to figure it out until you  learn how to tap it on the back and say  I know you there
7e5SQL_xLN8,2158310,2163410,but I'm built to deal with you
7e5SQL_xLN8,2163880,2171200,I don't want nobody to leave here today  and not understand why we must find a
7e5SQL_xLN8,2171200,2179000,way to push to pain to understand this  on the other side of that is glory do
7e5SQL_xLN8,2179000,2184550,not take the easy way out do not give up
7e5SQL_xLN8,2184550,2193100,based on instinct if you are forced to  stand down to retreat so that you can
7e5SQL_xLN8,2193100,2198610,rebuild Andrea tack so be it
7e5SQL_xLN8,2198610,2204580,but make that decision based on logic
7e5SQL_xLN8,2204580,2211960,not on the instinct of surrender and  defeat
7e5SQL_xLN8,2212480,2219810,and you need to train that instinct your
7e5SQL_xLN8,2219810,2232050,instinct trained it to say get up go  fight on and if that is what you become
7e5SQL_xLN8,2232050,2238200,if that becomes your fundamental  reaction to adversity if that becomes
7e5SQL_xLN8,2238200,2245220,your gut instinct then you will overcome
7e5SQL_xLN8,2245220,2253140,just about anything that stands in your  bath there's two sides of pain that I
7e5SQL_xLN8,2253140,2258510,don't think a lot of people really  understand Frank there's there's one
7e5SQL_xLN8,2258510,2263760,side of pain that's the suffering and  the discomfort side of pain that's why  everybody raised their hands for my
7e5SQL_xLN8,2263760,2269119,first acts do you have everything I've  ever been through pain because that  hurts you remember what that felt like
7e5SQL_xLN8,2269119,2277359,but then there's another side of pain  that's called effort it's called glory
7e5SQL_xLN8,2277359,2282670,it's called if you can find a way to  push to pain there's something Freda on
7e5SQL_xLN8,2282670,2289299,the other side of it and and and and if  you never tap into it it's because the
7e5SQL_xLN8,2289299,2295350,first time you felt it you backed off  first time you felt ah that burn the
7e5SQL_xLN8,2295350,2301500,first time you feel that it's too much  we rationalize what ourselves so where
7e5SQL_xLN8,2301500,2306900,we automatically give up so much life
7e5SQL_xLN8,2306900,2312030,look  that's why kids have a problem finishing

7e5SQL_xLN8,2581110,2591990,a chance for you to give up and for you  to just to fall apart but there's also
7e5SQL_xLN8,2591990,2597600,opportunity there's opportunity to get

7e5SQL_xLN8,2665200,2674759,covered in blood and sweat and dirt and  filth as you rise above what you were
7e5SQL_xLN8,2675000,2683390,and as you take the form of  of who you're supposed to be
7e5SQL_xLN8,2686040,2691360,you see  the very act of standing up in the very
7e5SQL_xLN8,2691360,2697490,act of fighting on you will become and  you will remain

7e5SQL_xLN8,2725010,2730740,president States so how can I contribute  that most of society and I went to a  seminar my man named Jim Rohn he stole
7e5SQL_xLN8,2730740,2737640,some of our speakers I took a week's pay  as working 40 dollars a week as a  janitor and it was 35 dollars to the
7e5SQL_xLN8,2737640,2744180,evening seminar so his big decision I  listened him speak I came in so inspired  it's mostly said I already believed Mao
7e5SQL_xLN8,2744180,2749280,was an authority figure saying you  really could be this way well I paid the  price
7e5SQL_xLN8,2749280,2754400,why work this hard why go this far
7e5SQL_xLN8,2754400,2759810,why try to learn this much why try to do

7e5SQL_xLN8,2814430,2819870,that's a good question why and you're  the only one personally that can answer
7e5SQL_xLN8,2819870,2825800,that question for yourself you've got to  have your own list of water
7e5SQL_xLN8,2827530,2836560,work on your list of wives if the Y is
7e5SQL_xLN8,2836560,2843160,powerful the how is easy if you want to

7e5SQL_xLN8,2849580,2854890,for of all that you dream and scheme is  about it and life seems useless and
7e5SQL_xLN8,2854890,2861040,worthless without it and if you're going  to be sweat fought and fretboard and a  plan for and lose all your terror of the
7e5SQL_xLN8,2861040,2867670,opposition for that if you simply go  after that thing that you want with all  of your capacity strengthens and gastly
7e5SQL_xLN8,2867670,2874870,Faith Hope and confidence and stern  pertinacity if neither cold poverty  famine God sickness a pain of body and
7e5SQL_xLN8,2874870,2882120,brain can keep you away from the thing  that you want and dogged and grim you  can see gender centered the top of God
7e5SQL_xLN8,2882120,2888450,but if the Y isn't strong if your goals  are
7e5SQL_xLN8,2888450,2894810,if the vision isn't clear the old  prophet said without a vision we die  without a vision we perish without a

7e5SQL_xLN8,2901320,2916130,the story they believe about themselves  he interrupted the story that I believed  about myself work on your list of why

7e5SQL_xLN8,2972579,2979890,forever  there's two sides of pain that I don't  think a lot of people really understand

7e5SQL_xLN8,3226210,3232180,greatness in any field greatness cannot
7e5SQL_xLN8,3232180,3241120,be achieved because every day is a new  day every moment is a new moment so now
7e5SQL_xLN8,3241120,3248390,you got to go on and show them that I'm  a different creature  now that was five minutes ago
7e5SQL_xLN8,3248390,3255270,because on this all for greatness  there's a dream that me you okay with me
7e5SQL_xLN8,3255270,3261270,go and no man you'll take me into space  you made a choice to be average walk of
7e5SQL_xLN8,3261270,3267360,the people around you I have to an  average school or you work for an  average company so if you decided you
7e5SQL_xLN8,3267360,3273660,decided to go against who you are never
7e5SQL_xLN8,3273660,3291720,say never because limits like fears  often there's a great feeling
7e5SQL_xLN8,3291720,3299670,in these overcoming these difficult  things cuz life is never this just  constant state of I'm at a nine all day
7e5SQL_xLN8,3299670,3309540,and when I'm with my wife  I hit ten yay and I stay like that  that's not real it all comes from life
7e5SQL_xLN8,3309540,3315240,lessons and the lessons are learned  through struggle and I think that  there's a lot of people out there that
7e5SQL_xLN8,3315240,3321510,think somehow or another you're gonna  get to someplace where you living in  silk sheets and you're getting your toes  done on someone's dropping grapes into
7e5SQL_xLN8,3321510,3327980,your mouth  I don't want that I've never wanted that  that guy's not gonna be happy
7e5SQL_xLN8,3329400,3334530,you have been fed this line of horseshit  that you're supposed to seek comfort and
7e5SQL_xLN8,3334530,3340380,I don't think you are I think you're  supposed to seek lessons and you're  supposed to seek difficult tasks and and
7e5SQL_xLN8,3340380,3349410,and and accomplishments and through  those things and through doing things  that are hard to do because if I just
7e5SQL_xLN8,3349410,3355350,think well tomorrow I'm just gonna coast  and eat Twinkies and watch TV  oh hello sadness my old friend hello
7e5SQL_xLN8,3355350,3362580,depression and we can pretend that were  something other than what we really are  and we could pretend nah me man I'm just
7e5SQL_xLN8,3362580,3366470,cool just chilling doing nothing
7e5SQL_xLN8,3369830,3377210,little improvements I think are what  life is all about and I think also  they're they're a tool to feed the mind
7e5SQL_xLN8,3377210,3386079,because I really believe the mind needs  these little lessons the mind needs  these little these little tasks
7e5SQL_xLN8,3387220,3392980,stimulation and reward lack of these  peaks and valleys and again this
7e5SQL_xLN8,3392980,3400220,[ __ ] idea that we're constantly fed  that you should be comfortable those  were human reward systems are carved
7e5SQL_xLN8,3400220,3406940,deeply into your DNA if you don't  respect that if you don't respect the  mechanism of happiness and fulfillment
7e5SQL_xLN8,3406940,3412070,and what you really need to do in order  to feel satisfied in life camaraderie
7e5SQL_xLN8,3412070,3419780,love family friendship struggle testing  yourself learning all those things are
7e5SQL_xLN8,3419780,3429290,imperative they're all a giant part of  being a person improvements over things
7e5SQL_xLN8,3429290,3433030,it's why doing difficult things is good
7e5SQL_xLN8,3441360,3448840,here's what I want you to look at  they're winners they're losers and there
7e5SQL_xLN8,3448840,3456940,are people who have not discovered how  to win and all they need is some
7e5SQL_xLN8,3456940,3463000,coaching all they need is some help and  assistance just a little support all
7e5SQL_xLN8,3463000,3470080,they need is some insight or different  strategy a plan of action to make some  adjustments that will open up the key to
7e5SQL_xLN8,3470080,3476320,a whole new future for them that will  give them access to the unlimited power  that they have within themselves that's
7e5SQL_xLN8,3476320,3481660,all that they need  so what I want you to do is this think
7e5SQL_xLN8,3481660,3488200,about something you want to you that's
7e5SQL_xLN8,3488200,3493930,real for you that's important for you  that will give your life some special
7e5SQL_xLN8,3493930,3499510,meaning and power and I don't even want  you to say I can do that I don't want
7e5SQL_xLN8,3499510,3506470,you to assume that see five years ago
7e5SQL_xLN8,3506470,3512710,when I started out in this area I would  not have been able to make the mental  leap that I would be up to where I am
7e5SQL_xLN8,3512710,3521619,right now I don't want you to begin to  just psych yourself out no no I want you
7e5SQL_xLN8,3521619,3527980,to be able to say something to yourself  that will enable you to maintain a level  of integrity with yourself that when you
7e5SQL_xLN8,3527980,3535690,say this even when you face tremendous  setbacks it it will be a benchmark to  keep you in the game to keep you moving
7e5SQL_xLN8,3535690,3543760,forward experimenting and readjusting  your strategy and your plan of action  continuously looking for ways to win so
7e5SQL_xLN8,3543760,3549190,what is that something when you got an  idea you want to move on
7e5SQL_xLN8,3549190,3554619,you might not have the money you might  not have the education you might not  have the support or resources you need
7e5SQL_xLN8,3554619,3560890,what is that something that can keep us  going that will enable us to act on our
7e5SQL_xLN8,3560890,3568060,dream what's one of those keys that will  begin to help us to discover the secrets
7e5SQL_xLN8,3568060,3576040,to our dream say it's possible it's all  I want you do when you look at your  dream you say to yourself every day it's
7e5SQL_xLN8,3576040,3583440,possible  let's say that everyday to yourself it's  possible because what does that do see
7e5SQL_xLN8,3583440,3589240,it begins to change your belief system  see the way in which we operate ladies
7e5SQL_xLN8,3589240,3595650,and gentlemen it's a manifestation of  what we believe what's possible for us
7e5SQL_xLN8,3595650,3601240,whatever you've done up to this point  all that it really is is a duplication
7e5SQL_xLN8,3601240,3608790,it's a reproduction of what you believe  subconsciously that you deserve and  what's possible for your life
7e5SQL_xLN8,3608790,3614770,most people operate out of the their  personal history out of their memory  things they have done things have
7e5SQL_xLN8,3614770,3620859,experienced things they've seen things  that they have observed what I'm  suggesting that you operate out of a
7e5SQL_xLN8,3620859,3626619,larger vision of yourself I want you to  see yourself doing what you want to do  experiencing what you want to experience
7e5SQL_xLN8,3626619,3631809,it having what you want to have doing  what is that gives your life the meaning
7e5SQL_xLN8,3631809,3637599,and value operate out of your  imagination not your memory because
7e5SQL_xLN8,3637599,3643869,whatever you look at where you want to  go I wanted to warn you you will have  some conversation back here after you go
7e5SQL_xLN8,3643869,3650370,through the data that you've experienced  in life saying you can't do it  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,3650370,3655960,and so what you want to begin to do is  ignore that inner conversation what most
7e5SQL_xLN8,3655960,3661180,people ladies and gentlemen when  something happens to them what they do
7e5SQL_xLN8,3661180,3668980,is they begin to believe that that's the  way it is that's the way it's always  been  and they can't see the possibility of it
7e5SQL_xLN8,3668980,3678490,being any different example before in  April 1954 the common belief the
7e5SQL_xLN8,3678490,3685720,universe will believe because it had  been tried again and again and again and  people that fail the belief laws that
7e5SQL_xLN8,3685720,3691540,man was not physically capable of  breaking the four-minute barrier that he
7e5SQL_xLN8,3691540,3697000,could not run a mile in less than four  minutes that was the belief on the
7e5SQL_xLN8,3697000,3703200,planet it had never been done but here's  what happened
7e5SQL_xLN8,3703200,3708630,[Music]  [Applause]
7e5SQL_xLN8,3708930,3716029,[Music]  Roger Bannister came along
7e5SQL_xLN8,3716079,3721650,and he broke the four-minute barrier
7e5SQL_xLN8,3722380,3729640,now here's what's significant about that  since that time up to this day over
7e5SQL_xLN8,3729640,3735140,"20,000 people have done it including  high school kids"
7e5SQL_xLN8,3735140,3744320,"[Music]  what change 20,000 people what change"
7e5SQL_xLN8,3744320,3749510,here's what happened when they got on  the track they knew it had been done and
7e5SQL_xLN8,3749510,3755030,because they knew it had been done there  was a new belief about this barrier
7e5SQL_xLN8,3755030,3760450,about this goal that was unreachable and
7e5SQL_xLN8,3760450,3766670,"those 20,000 people died in the race  believing going in their heart that"
7e5SQL_xLN8,3766670,3773240,someone had done it that it's possible  the victim I'm saying that if you know
7e5SQL_xLN8,3773240,3778700,anybody that had some goal some dreams  something they wanted to do and they did
7e5SQL_xLN8,3778700,3785619,it denied saying that you know in your  heart that if someone has done it in
7e5SQL_xLN8,3785619,3790910,and that if someone can make their dream  become a reality that it's it's possible
7e5SQL_xLN8,3790910,3800810,that you can make your dream become  reality and so as you begin to look at  where you want to go beginning to
7e5SQL_xLN8,3800810,3806869,embrace that it's possible  I'm less than highly favored I've got a
7e5SQL_xLN8,3806869,3812390,lot going for me I've got some good  stuff in me and it's possible that I can
7e5SQL_xLN8,3812390,3818300,bring my greatness out here in the  universe  that I can do what I want to do it's
7e5SQL_xLN8,3818300,3825109,possible I can write my own book I can  have my own business I I can take the  trip and travel around the world it's
7e5SQL_xLN8,3825109,3830210,possible I can bounce back from  adversity and reinvent my life it's
7e5SQL_xLN8,3830210,3836300,possible regardless of where I am the  things can get better for me it's
7e5SQL_xLN8,3836300,3842839,possible to take that challenge when you
7e5SQL_xLN8,3842839,3851160,answer the call and you see the other  side of pain  it's called glory this is called glory
7e5SQL_xLN8,3851160,3858040,there's somebody sitting home right now  there's a young 10 year old kid sitting  home that don't have a father and he's

7e5SQL_xLN8,3884460,3890160,different from the practical life that  you got to get up and meet every day

7e5SQL_xLN8,4173470,4181600,and that - defines what your legacy is  dr. miles my role compares leaders to
7e5SQL_xLN8,4181600,4187000,the king of the jungle he says he says  the line that's not the tallest having  won the tunnel the Lions it's not the
7e5SQL_xLN8,4187000,4193119,largest salmon when the tongue the light  is  smarter Florida's most intelligent  Hannah Brundage on and yet when the lion
7e5SQL_xLN8,4193119,4199430,shows up he is king  he is king you don't need to be  intelligent you don't need to be smart
7e5SQL_xLN8,4199430,4207470,you don't need to have a certain height  you don't need to have a certain way you  don't need to have any kind of advantage  and yet you can be a leader now what's
7e5SQL_xLN8,4207470,4212810,not the biggest the strongest more  fastest but my goals were clear my
7e5SQL_xLN8,4212810,4218590,actions were and still on service those  when the gazelle wakes up it runs but if
7e5SQL_xLN8,4218590,4225970,a lion ain't chasing it it's not when  the lion wakes up you don't need nobody
7e5SQL_xLN8,4225970,4231220,to push it it pushes itself I'm faster  now are you gonna say I'm trying to look
7e5SQL_xLN8,4231220,4236350,at each second to make sure I'm doing  something in seconds I want to make sure  each minute I'm doing some of these  minute how to make sure it every hour

7e5SQL_xLN8,4306960,4315540,it's not what happens in the game is  what happened before the game and it's  what's gonna happen after the game it's
7e5SQL_xLN8,4315540,4323640,what you see this is what actually is  happening Kobe Bryant didn't arrive on
7e5SQL_xLN8,4323640,4332850,court five seconds before the game and  hope that he's gonna make that shot he
7e5SQL_xLN8,4332850,4339990,made that shot a thousand times before  but that's why they have a mystique
7e5SQL_xLN8,4339990,4348060,about him an essence of magic almost  superhuman you are witnessing the

7e5SQL_xLN8,4388940,4395840,many people looking towards these stars  and these inspirational people and  seeing that results I'm thinking that's
7e5SQL_xLN8,4395840,4401140,what success is but success was the  journey success was getting out of dirt
7e5SQL_xLN8,4401140,4410270,success was coming from the bottom you  don't start your story to top you better

7e5SQL_xLN8,4483390,4489510,you can't do it it you can stop looking  at the end result what you want is an
7e5SQL_xLN8,4489510,4495710,opportunity to shoot that shot just  don't see don't see the floor

7e5SQL_xLN8,4841169,4846419,game of football since I was seven the  second game in my junior year fourth  quarter a little bit over two minutes
7e5SQL_xLN8,4846419,4852030,left in the game we were playing against  Air Force I went to make a tackle and I  hit the guy my body went completely limp

7e5SQL_xLN8,4865210,4870460,blame the game of football I couldn't  blame the guy that I hit I couldn't  blame life instead it made me question

7e5SQL_xLN8,4902350,4908980,energy but while I live my life I wear  this as a badge of honor every single  day the adversity the opposition that
7e5SQL_xLN8,4908980,4914200,life said to break me I wear it as a  badge of honor because I understand  every day of my life
7e5SQL_xLN8,4914200,4921490,I represent something so we already know  what time it is we know they're gonna  try to break us we already know anything
7e5SQL_xLN8,4921490,4927010,we didn't we already know that we know  they coming at us we know they gonna  throw everything they got at us so
7e5SQL_xLN8,4927010,4932050,here's how we gonna beat it what we're  working for is greater than meeting you  and so we gotta press forward and we got

7e5SQL_xLN8,4943199,4951439,gained success no coach no trainer no  mentor no boss can do it you versus you
7e5SQL_xLN8,4952459,4958050,none of us wake up and say today is the  day I destroy my life you can run into a
7e5SQL_xLN8,4958050,4964409,trap and you you you set up a life that  you didn't really want what we do is we
7e5SQL_xLN8,4964409,4969929,kind of check out because it feels  overwhelming or we check out because
7e5SQL_xLN8,4969929,4977189,we're afraid or we check out because we  start listening to self-doubt and then  we make these teeny tiny decisions all
7e5SQL_xLN8,4977189,4982860,day long we don't even realize it  decision to not get up on time a  decision to not eat the right thing a
7e5SQL_xLN8,4982860,4989459,decision to snap at your kids a decision  to not speak in a meeting a decision to  not look for a job a decision to not
7e5SQL_xLN8,4989459,4994739,deal with your finances a decision to  not call your parrot is all day long
7e5SQL_xLN8,4994739,5001189,these tiny decisions that take you so  far off track and then you wake up like  I didn't and you you look at your life
7e5SQL_xLN8,5001189,5006979,and you think how the hell did I get  here you're alone with your thoughts you  get an idea of what your thoughts
7e5SQL_xLN8,5006979,5013550,actually are and he run into the  abutment of a bridge and his life was  snuffed there if you had asked him a
7e5SQL_xLN8,5013550,5021280,half-hour before how much sand he had  left he would have said at least a half  a century he didn't have a half an hour
7e5SQL_xLN8,5025400,5030310,see the trick is we don't know how much  sand we have left
7e5SQL_xLN8,5033299,5040079,this is all we've got right here right  now we don't know how much we have left  in the future but we do know what we've
7e5SQL_xLN8,5040079,5045269,got now and I have found the people that  win are the people who make up their
7e5SQL_xLN8,5045269,5055679,mind then I'm gonna waste the meds  they're going to be productive they're  gonna make it happen  every minute often times people make the
7e5SQL_xLN8,5055679,5062069,mistake of getting stuck and it is just  a tactical mistake just like it would be  a mistake if you got stuck on a video
7e5SQL_xLN8,5062069,5071909,game the awful truth is is that life is  easy truly living chasing a dream and
7e5SQL_xLN8,5071909,5077519,truly living is hard you knew that there  was more in store freedom but you
7e5SQL_xLN8,5077519,5083010,couldn't figure out how you closed that  gap  how do you find the power that's and how
7e5SQL_xLN8,5083010,5089019,do you discover your greatness honey  solve these problems it's so  overwhelming
7e5SQL_xLN8,5089019,5094869,tooken chances navigated their way what  do they do differently than you what  what objectivity do they have that maybe
7e5SQL_xLN8,5094869,5101439,you lack what insight into their own  mistakes are they willing to delve into  that you're not that you step back and
7e5SQL_xLN8,5101439,5106599,good you know I don't just don't I just  don't want to look at myself that  closely but the person who's able to
7e5SQL_xLN8,5106599,5111760,look at themselves the closest it's  gonna get the more rational results is
7e5SQL_xLN8,5111760,5118749,that we're living our lives in these  very unfulfilled ways or you're going to  this office with artificial light and
7e5SQL_xLN8,5118749,5127900,you're doing something you don't want to  do all day long and then you get home  you're tired just go hike up to the top
7e5SQL_xLN8,5127900,5135519,of a mountain and look out you know  there's a reward that you get from that  that is intensely like soul filling
7e5SQL_xLN8,5135519,5145139,we're all taught that life is tough  life's a [ __ ] life is hard but it's not
7e5SQL_xLN8,5145139,5153939,it's pretty easy right it's pretty easy  to skate by and go through life right we
7e5SQL_xLN8,5153939,5159820,wake up every day most of us in the  world with the roof over our heads a big  comfy bed under our butts fridge full of
7e5SQL_xLN8,5159820,5166869,food most of us in the world especially  here in America never have to worry  about starvation or homelessness we have
7e5SQL_xLN8,5166869,5172630,friends and family that will help us out  when those things come those are the  things that made life dangerous a  hundred years ago now we complain if
7e5SQL_xLN8,5172630,5181229,life isn't convenient this isn't a  statement on modern society this is a  statement about motivation life is easy
7e5SQL_xLN8,5181229,5188040,easy to skate by the question isn't can  you handle the situation
7e5SQL_xLN8,5188040,5192710,the question is can you handle your mind
7e5SQL_xLN8,5194480,5200610,can you manage the thoughts and the  emotions that are trying to poison your

7e5SQL_xLN8,5218599,5225820,it is that something is broken if it's  your responsibility to fix it
7e5SQL_xLN8,5226100,5232080,it's not somebody's fault if their  father was an abusive alcoholic but is
7e5SQL_xLN8,5232080,5238170,for damn sure their responsibility to  figure out how they're gonna do with  those traumas and try to make a life out
7e5SQL_xLN8,5238170,5243800,of it  [Music]  it's not your fault if your partner
7e5SQL_xLN8,5243800,5249530,cheated and ruined your marriage but it  is for damn sure your responsibility to
7e5SQL_xLN8,5249530,5254780,figure out how to take that pain and how  to overcome that and build a happy life
7e5SQL_xLN8,5254780,5259739,for yourself  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,5260580,5267160,fault and responsibility do not go  together his socks but they don't was
7e5SQL_xLN8,5267160,5272230,something as somebody's fault we want  to suffer we want them punished we want
7e5SQL_xLN8,5272230,5277420,them to pay we want it to be their  responsibility to fix it but that's
7e5SQL_xLN8,5277420,5282730,that's not how it works especially when  it's your heart your heart your life
7e5SQL_xLN8,5282730,5289650,your happiness your responsibility  your responsibility
7e5SQL_xLN8,5291680,5297929,fear  it's not real
7e5SQL_xLN8,5298450,5303939,[Music]  [Applause]
7e5SQL_xLN8,5305369,5312920,the only place that fear can exist is in  our thoughts of future
7e5SQL_xLN8,5315080,5321020,the product of our imagination causing  us to fear things that do not at present
7e5SQL_xLN8,5321020,5331040,and may not ever exist as long as we're
7e5SQL_xLN8,5331040,5336260,pointing a finger and and stuck in whose  fault
7e5SQL_xLN8,5336260,5341930,something is we're jammed and trapped  into victim mode when you're in victim
7e5SQL_xLN8,5341930,5347990,oh you're stuck in suffering the road to  power is in taking responsibility your
7e5SQL_xLN8,5347990,5354110,heart your life your happiness is your  responsibility and your responsibility
7e5SQL_xLN8,5354110,5369700,alone I'm fragile I feel pain I heard I
7e5SQL_xLN8,5369700,5374930,opened my eyes I create I conquer I hold
7e5SQL_xLN8,5374930,5380440,the power  I'm a thinker I crave victory I do not
7e5SQL_xLN8,5380440,5385690,give up  I feel no fear I fear no man I'm an

7e5SQL_xLN8,5392440,5400449,"need every day of my life  is 86,400 seconds work on your focus"
7e5SQL_xLN8,5400449,5407769,perspective is everything probably most  of you is that you see difficult as
7e5SQL_xLN8,5407769,5414460,something negative should I want you to  see difficult differently are you  hearing me I need you to see difficult
7e5SQL_xLN8,5414460,5427329,differently it's amazing the one is you  stood out to get it over here that [ __ ]  is unacceptable can you be committed to
7e5SQL_xLN8,5427329,5433659,the process of what you do without being  emotionally attached to the result of  what you do because a lot of people can
7e5SQL_xLN8,5433659,5438670,be committed to the process of what they  do if the results don't change but the
7e5SQL_xLN8,5438670,5444550,moment the result or the outcome changes  of what they're chasing they shut it  down or they quit simply because the
7e5SQL_xLN8,5444550,5450489,result change so can we be committed to  the process of what we do but not  emotionally to the result of what we do
7e5SQL_xLN8,5450489,5455889,understanding every day I get up and  give everything I got to everything I'm  apart of simply because this is a way I
7e5SQL_xLN8,5455889,5462550,stop saying I've gotta wait for good  things to happen to me and I said I'm  gonna cry I'm going to fight I'm going
7e5SQL_xLN8,5462550,5469269,to work I'm going to press forward I'm  going to learn I'm going to do  everything in my power to become a

7e5SQL_xLN8,5495520,5502870,explain it any better than that I don't  know how it happens but winners win and  if you create a culture of losing if you
7e5SQL_xLN8,5502870,5509140,keep being a victim if you keep letting  losing happen to you if you keep letting  people do you a treat you mean a count
7e5SQL_xLN8,5509140,5514360,away it's gonna become a culture there's  nothing you can't accomplish you're  gonna go on you're gonna become world

7e5SQL_xLN8,5528070,5534469,is not that we are inadequate  our deepest fear is that we are powerful  beyond measure I never feared about my

7e5SQL_xLN8,5624590,5630860,opportunity you'll never realize your  dreams  whether you want them or not is the
7e5SQL_xLN8,5630860,5638179,relevance you don't know that until you  achieve it but most people have
7e5SQL_xLN8,5638179,5643909,strategies available or they could get  them or you could create them but the  problem is you got a story and your
7e5SQL_xLN8,5643909,5652999,story is why doesn't work and the story  is I've tried everything if you tried  everything you'd be fit you try

7e5SQL_xLN8,5697219,5704060,you can do more than this if I had to  walk ahead and walk it just became just  a process of grinding and grinding and
7e5SQL_xLN8,5704060,5710810,grinding the good word for it  it's not even a good word for it and  just just going further and further and
7e5SQL_xLN8,5710810,5717410,then when I got to running I'd go to the  bike I'd go to the pool if I got tired  somewhere my legs are tired I go to the

7e5SQL_xLN8,6929380,6935380,first year life can be timid by one  simple decision a lot of us give total
7e5SQL_xLN8,6935380,6941420,control to life  we don't have any control look please

7e5SQL_xLN8,6976090,6983249,protection  like to take these very quick fixes in  life we want the 6-minute ABS approach
7e5SQL_xLN8,6983249,6990300,to life you know nah man there's no  permanent in that there's no permanent  real and there's no scarring
7e5SQL_xLN8,6990300,6997079,it must be scarred get up and keep on
7e5SQL_xLN8,6997079,7002989,going that one moment change the rest of  my life as we run toward it as we work
7e5SQL_xLN8,7002989,7010429,on it day in and day out sometimes we  can't say I can do that but what we can
7e5SQL_xLN8,7010429,7017329,say that it's possible that I can have  my dream I was willing to take a chance
7e5SQL_xLN8,7017329,7024199,and most people won't do that most of  the people that you talk to to try and  bring them into the business these are
7e5SQL_xLN8,7024199,7030979,not risk-takers most people have done  all that they're ever going to do they  raise a family they earn a living and
7e5SQL_xLN8,7030979,7038539,then they died but people who are  running toward their dreams life has a  special kind of meaning in the process
7e5SQL_xLN8,7038539,7044659,of working on your dreams you are going  to incur it incur a lot of
7e5SQL_xLN8,7044659,7052599,disappointment a lot of failure a lot of  pain a lot of setbacks a lot of defeats
7e5SQL_xLN8,7052599,7058099,but in the process of doing that you  will discover some things about yourself
7e5SQL_xLN8,7058099,7063229,that you don't know right now that you
7e5SQL_xLN8,7063229,7070010,have greatness within you you're more  powerful than you can ever begin to  imagine you're greater than your
7e5SQL_xLN8,7070010,7077119,circumstances that you don't have to go  through life being a victim most people  don't work on their dreams why for many
7e5SQL_xLN8,7077119,7082159,years I did one is because of fear the  fear of failure what if things don't
7e5SQL_xLN8,7082159,7087169,work out and the fear of success what if  they do and I can't handle it they stop
7e5SQL_xLN8,7087169,7093679,growing they stop working on themselves  they stop stretching they stop pushing  themselves and they throw in the towel
7e5SQL_xLN8,7093679,7101130,on themselves and on their families and  on their dreams  most people don't feel worthy
7e5SQL_xLN8,7101130,7106170,what I'm doing now I could have been  doing years ago but because I did not
7e5SQL_xLN8,7106170,7113340,have a college education because I  didn't believe in myself because I  allowed other people's opinion of me to
7e5SQL_xLN8,7113340,7119010,control my destiny I didn't act on my  ideas I was born in an abandoned
7e5SQL_xLN8,7119010,7125639,building on a Hardin Olien floor with my  twin brother we were six weeks of age we
7e5SQL_xLN8,7125639,7132630,were adopted labeled educable mentally  [ __ ] and stayed in that category  until I got out of high school I don't
7e5SQL_xLN8,7132630,7138510,have any college training I applaud you  for believing in yourself because that's
7e5SQL_xLN8,7138510,7144810,what life is about  stretching and challenging looking for  ways that you can begin to improve
7e5SQL_xLN8,7144810,7155340,yourself sometimes we can't say I can do  that but what we can say that it's
7e5SQL_xLN8,7155340,7160219,possible that I can have my dream
7e5SQL_xLN8,7168310,7173660,no one could have convinced me that  after just over six years I will have my
7e5SQL_xLN8,7173660,7178940,own book entitled live your dreams just  over six years I will have five specials
7e5SQL_xLN8,7178940,7185000,on public television just over six years  I've done motivational speaking I will  now have my own talk show that will

7e5SQL_xLN8,7191810,7199580,[Applause]  [Music]  not only is it important for you to know
7e5SQL_xLN8,7199580,7205369,it's possible for you to choose your  future but it's necessary that you work
7e5SQL_xLN8,7205369,7210590,on yourself that you develop yourself  it's necessary that you get the energy
7e5SQL_xLN8,7210590,7215869,drainers out of your life people who  don't want anything  people are not striving people are not
7e5SQL_xLN8,7215869,7221590,challenging themselves people who aren't  growing people who have stopped dreaming
7e5SQL_xLN8,7221590,7226940,it's necessary that you align yourself  with people and attract people into your
7e5SQL_xLN8,7226940,7232940,business who are hungry people who are  unstoppable and unreasonable people who
7e5SQL_xLN8,7232940,7239320,are refusing to leave life just as it is  and who want more
7e5SQL_xLN8,7240650,7246300,everybody won't see it that everybody  won't join you that everybody won't have

7e5SQL_xLN8,7579940,7588369,you're called to it could be anything it  could be the adoption of a child it
7e5SQL_xLN8,7588369,7593920,could be the creation of something that  you've known you wanted to write for  your whole life it could be opening up a

7e5SQL_xLN8,7616500,7623580,take us where we were intended to go  when we signed up for this most men and
7e5SQL_xLN8,7623580,7630690,even quiet desperation the most of us  don't feel like because we're not using  that which we've been given that we are
7e5SQL_xLN8,7630690,7636600,punished that we're going to write  getting up in the morning with no reason  to get up once you find out your
7e5SQL_xLN8,7636600,7641610,preference in life and once you decide  that you're going to live a life of  sharing and giving and contributing to
7e5SQL_xLN8,7641610,7648930,life  you don't need an alarm clock to get up  you are needed what is it that I'm
7e5SQL_xLN8,7648930,7655790,supposed to do what is my life worth  [Music]  but we're in if you decide that I'm
7e5SQL_xLN8,7655790,7660800,going to begin to start living like  generously I'm going to stop giving more

7e5SQL_xLN8,7666680,7673220,gentlemen I guarantee you that life will  take on a whole new meaning for you I  guarantee you that as you begin to give
7e5SQL_xLN8,7673220,7679280,more of yourself in your work give more  of yourself in your marriage get more of  yourself in your relationships with your
7e5SQL_xLN8,7679280,7684440,families and friends get more of  yourself to your talent to your vocation  to your job or your business as you
7e5SQL_xLN8,7684440,7689769,begin to set high standards for giving  that which you have been given to share  in the universe
7e5SQL_xLN8,7689769,7697840,I guarantee you that light takes on a  whole new dimension there is there is
7e5SQL_xLN8,7697840,7704829,something that is calling you and when  an idea gets ahold of you you get into
7e5SQL_xLN8,7704829,7712480,this place of surrender we say a  motivated person doesn't allow obstacles
7e5SQL_xLN8,7712480,7717519,to show up in their life and doesn't  allow for anyone to interfere with them
7e5SQL_xLN8,7717519,7725670,and it's really highly directed towards  a particular goal so motivation is
7e5SQL_xLN8,7725670,7730348,getting a hold of an idea and carrying  it out
7e5SQL_xLN8,7735269,7740949,the reason mozart didn't have to ask  anyone how to write symphonies is that
7e5SQL_xLN8,7740949,7748719,symphonies presented themselves to him  invented enlarged produced all at once
7e5SQL_xLN8,7748719,7759530,in what he described as lively dreams  ray rage against the dying of the light
7e5SQL_xLN8,7759530,7764750,I choose not to sleep in I don't give in
7e5SQL_xLN8,7764750,7771200,to the temptation of the warm blankets  not go gentle into that good night rage
7e5SQL_xLN8,7771200,7777130,rage against the dying of the light
7e5SQL_xLN8,7780280,7785450,doesn't matter what your age is it  doesn't matter what your beliefs have  been it doesn't matter what other people
7e5SQL_xLN8,7785450,7791540,have tried to convince you of it if  you're gonna have lasting change in
7e5SQL_xLN8,7791540,7798410,anything you're really talking about  just raising your standards the true
7e5SQL_xLN8,7798410,7804530,quality of a man is what do you do when  nobody is looking I mean I always tell
7e5SQL_xLN8,7804530,7811640,people if you want to know how to change  your life and give it to you in three  words boring as it sounds  raise your standard and get out of bed
7e5SQL_xLN8,7811640,7819230,at 4:55 a vast majority of the world is  still sleeping do you want you are up
7e5SQL_xLN8,7819230,7824480,getting after it the world is yours  or up before the enemy there's no
7e5SQL_xLN8,7824480,7830900,traffic the gym is empty there is no one  to distract you or call you or send you
7e5SQL_xLN8,7830900,7836810,some stupid text about something you  don't care about everybody in life gets
7e5SQL_xLN8,7836810,7841690,their lusts they don't get their shirts
7e5SQL_xLN8,7841870,7851030,lasting change is different than a goal  you don't always get your goals but you  always get your standards but when you
7e5SQL_xLN8,7851030,7856550,decide something as a must for you an  absolute must when you come up any  possible you say I'm gonna find the way
7e5SQL_xLN8,7856550,7861590,I'm gonna make the way human beings when  they resolve things may I make a real
7e5SQL_xLN8,7861590,7870230,resolution inside themselves which is  they raise the standard they make it a  must they find the way I tell people the
7e5SQL_xLN8,7870230,7878170,strongest force in the whole human  personality is this need to stay  consistent with how we define ourselves
7e5SQL_xLN8,7879940,7887030,so go to bed early and wake up early  people constantly ask me for the secret
7e5SQL_xLN8,7887030,7893300,of getting up early I tell them it is  simple set your alarm clock and get out
7e5SQL_xLN8,7893300,7901550,of bed when it goes off that's it so
7e5SQL_xLN8,7901550,7910970,they hit snooze they roll over they go  back to sleep no get up and get going
7e5SQL_xLN8,7910970,7918710,and so they go through life holding back  holding back on life not understanding
7e5SQL_xLN8,7918710,7924650,this also that what you hold back from  life life holds back from you so most of
7e5SQL_xLN8,7924650,7929660,us go through life ladies and gentlemen  not giving and we're cheating ourselves
7e5SQL_xLN8,7929660,7936470,and you're also cheating life  human-beings absolutely follow through

7e5SQL_xLN8,7976010,7982489,of us have some work to do I strongly  believe that that each one of us showed  up to do something that
7e5SQL_xLN8,7982489,7988429,showed up to contribute something to  life and that
7e5SQL_xLN8,7988429,7990909,don't do it

7e5SQL_xLN8,8172650,8182330,this is what's wrong with people today  they think that great lives just bother  the die if they dream hard enough
7e5SQL_xLN8,8182360,8190110,fantasies hard enough and long enough  they keep stroking that that their life  will turn out just the way they dream it
7e5SQL_xLN8,8190110,8202040,supply you're feeding yourself every day  alive why when they continue to fight it
7e5SQL_xLN8,8202040,8207120,why would they continue to go home even
7e5SQL_xLN8,8207120,8212790,though they are being beaten all across

7e5SQL_xLN8,8240250,8249909,answer is simple they cannot help
7e5SQL_xLN8,8249909,8256239,themselves because they are a fighter
7e5SQL_xLN8,8256239,8261939,and being a fighter it is in bread in

7e5SQL_xLN8,8790390,8797530,world become weaker people is by  caffeine your brain is by putting this  kind of garbage in it about not
7e5SQL_xLN8,8797530,8806170,attacking but you're not good at it's  about putting the cap on managing your  expectations if I live that way
7e5SQL_xLN8,8806170,8811260,process like managing expectations I  would be
7e5SQL_xLN8,8811940,8818189,working some job at me  and our
7e5SQL_xLN8,8818189,8824989,my capability  I would never have been  I'll raise you school all these things I
7e5SQL_xLN8,8824989,8831499,did gotta take a shot you have to live
7e5SQL_xLN8,8831499,8838489,at the edge of your capabilities work  through the weakness fight through the
7e5SQL_xLN8,8838489,8848389,temptation  hold the line you gotta live where
7e5SQL_xLN8,8848389,8857079,you're almost certain you're gonna fail  fail early fail often fail forward whose
7e5SQL_xLN8,8857079,8864139,minutes and those hours they turn into  weeks and months and years and moving
7e5SQL_xLN8,8864139,8870189,the line in those critical minutes will  put you in an infinitely better place
7e5SQL_xLN8,8870189,8879169,physically and mentally if you maintain  the discipline I think they're all
7e5SQL_xLN8,8879169,8887810,heading into an unforgiving environment  what we're gonna have to be both bold  and disciplined you know when you go to
7e5SQL_xLN8,8887810,8894499,the gym and you work out you're actually  seeking failure you want to take your  muscles to the point where you get to
7e5SQL_xLN8,8894499,8899799,failure because that's where the the  adaptation is that's where growth is
7e5SQL_xLN8,8899799,8907579,realize when you rewind the tape of your  own life is that there are these crucial  moments where if the luck had gone the
7e5SQL_xLN8,8907579,8914890,other way you might have gotten killed  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,8915450,8924900,and so what you have to do is to always  be exploiting those extra disciplines in  place because I was lucky to live and
7e5SQL_xLN8,8924900,8932210,what I took from that is I never want to  have to be reluctant to live a gift
7e5SQL_xLN8,8932210,8939720,discipline is the root of all good  qualities but you have to absolutely
7e5SQL_xLN8,8939720,8947070,apply it to things outside of just  waking up early I want to live because
7e5SQL_xLN8,8947070,8954580,of my discipline not because of my wife  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,8954580,8960130,that's what discipline is disciplines  taking hard road the uphill load to do
7e5SQL_xLN8,8960130,8967890,what's right for yourself and for other  people
7e5SQL_xLN8,8969680,8980260,[Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,8981080,8986250,and most importantly it'll put you on
7e5SQL_xLN8,8986250,8997610,that path to freedom it does start with
7e5SQL_xLN8,8997610,9003410,waking up early it really does so often
7e5SQL_xLN8,9003410,9010760,the easy path the easy path that calls  to us to be weak for that moment to
7e5SQL_xLN8,9010760,9016070,break down for that moment to give in to
7e5SQL_xLN8,9016070,9027380,the desire and the short-term  gratification but the discipline will
7e5SQL_xLN8,9027380,9036110,not allow that the discipline calls for  strength and fortitude and will it won't
7e5SQL_xLN8,9036110,9045770,accept weakness it won't tolerate  another break down the discipline can
7e5SQL_xLN8,9045770,9052149,seem like it's your worst enemy
7e5SQL_xLN8,9061750,9068591,but the reality is  discipline is your best friend it will
7e5SQL_xLN8,9068591,9076291,take care of you like nothing else can  and will put you on that path
7e5SQL_xLN8,9077780,9088760,the path to strength and health and  intelligence and happiness and most
7e5SQL_xLN8,9088760,9094720,importantly it'll put you on that path
7e5SQL_xLN8,9094720,9102330,to freedom  discipline is eating the right foods to
7e5SQL_xLN8,9102330,9106220,fuel your system
7e5SQL_xLN8,9108870,9114900,it's about disciplining your emotions so  you can make good decisions it's about
7e5SQL_xLN8,9114900,9122521,having the discipline to control your  ego so your ego doesn't get out of hand
7e5SQL_xLN8,9122521,9128011,and control you it's about treating
7e5SQL_xLN8,9128011,9134580,people the way you would want to be  treated and and doing the tasks that you
7e5SQL_xLN8,9134580,9142490,don't necessarily want to do but that  you know will help you or help your team
7e5SQL_xLN8,9142881,9149851,about facing your fears it's discipline
7e5SQL_xLN8,9149851,9154431,to face your fears so you can conquer  them
7e5SQL_xLN8,9157870,9164939,how do I get the desire to have  discipline  how do I
7e5SQL_xLN8,9164939,9170550,get the desire to have  disk
7e5SQL_xLN8,9172500,9179520,I keep getting asked this type of  question how do I get discipline or how  do I want discipline or how do I
7e5SQL_xLN8,9179520,9187050,maintain discipline and the answer it's  it's a simple answer but obviously it's
7e5SQL_xLN8,9187050,9193229,not easy and there's all kinds of little  tricks and methods that people talk
7e5SQL_xLN8,9193229,9200819,about I've never met a person who was  not successful that didn't have a great
7e5SQL_xLN8,9200819,9206160,amount of self-discipline within their  life self-discipline and being able to
7e5SQL_xLN8,9206160,9212910,perform and being able to keep your life  on schedule and being able to keep  commitments and promises and meet
7e5SQL_xLN8,9212910,9218069,deadlines is essential to success none
7e5SQL_xLN8,9218069,9223529,of us none of us can afford to have a  life that is controlled by someone else
7e5SQL_xLN8,9223529,9230520,or a life that is basically controlled  by our emotions you know do the little  things people say and wake up early I
7e5SQL_xLN8,9230520,9237779,say that and write things down and take  cold showers and tell everyone what
7e5SQL_xLN8,9237779,9244620,you're going to do so broadcast it and  make promises or or make bets with with
7e5SQL_xLN8,9244620,9250410,your friends but the fact of the matter  is that the reason discipline is hard to
7e5SQL_xLN8,9250410,9258330,maintain is because it is hard to  maintain I learned many years ago that
7e5SQL_xLN8,9258330,9264479,there are two kinds of people there's  the type of person who says I'm gonna  wait till I feel like it before I do it
7e5SQL_xLN8,9264479,9272370,and then there's a person who says I've  got to do it so that I feel like it  that's what makes discipline hard it's
7e5SQL_xLN8,9272370,9281200,hard  and if you hear me claim that discipline
7e5SQL_xLN8,9281200,9287710,is easy for me then straight up  that's just my ego talking that's what
7e5SQL_xLN8,9287710,9297730,that is and it is work to maintain the  discipline that's what it is work one
7e5SQL_xLN8,9297730,9303790,will never get anything done because  they're sterile waiting to feel the  moment to move when the other person
7e5SQL_xLN8,9303790,9309760,says no I need to move and then I will  begin to feel the movement maintaining
7e5SQL_xLN8,9309760,9315610,the standard giving no slack none that's
7e5SQL_xLN8,9315610,9326200,the discipline that's the discipline and  it is hard so I have a challenge for
7e5SQL_xLN8,9326200,9331450,every one of you this weekend the  challenge is simple ask yourself am i
7e5SQL_xLN8,9331450,9338350,practicing self discipline in my life am  i doing the things that I should do  because I need to do them or am I kind
7e5SQL_xLN8,9338350,9346279,of waiting to feel the moment  [Music]
7e5SQL_xLN8,9346279,9355010,and if there's one thing I would say  that does make it easier it's to
7e5SQL_xLN8,9355010,9363210,envision what it feels like when you're  done what it feels like after you've
7e5SQL_xLN8,9363210,9373170,worked out or you've held the line on  your food intake or you've pushed  through some monotonous project that you
7e5SQL_xLN8,9373170,9382470,have to do in all those things when  they're done that they feel good they're
7e5SQL_xLN8,9382470,9388199,all simple if you don't work out you  don't get a you don't get a muscle right  so I always tell people this is there's  a daily practice like priming if you
7e5SQL_xLN8,9388199,9393569,don't do that if you get up and you just  have no discipline whatsoever you get no  value of anything your diets don't work
7e5SQL_xLN8,9393569,9400439,when you don't do them exercise doesn't  work when you don't do them but most of  people have have some experiences that  they want to shift and once you shift
7e5SQL_xLN8,9400439,9405229,those things your whole life changes but  life is constant growth
7e5SQL_xLN8,9406490,9412820,[Music]  contrary to that envision what you will
7e5SQL_xLN8,9412820,9421240,feel like later when you let the  discipline slack you know the feeling
7e5SQL_xLN8,9421240,9426530,feeling weak and defeated and you know
7e5SQL_xLN8,9426530,9434810,that you're falling behind hold the line
7e5SQL_xLN8,9434810,9440710,maintain the discipline it is not easy
7e5SQL_xLN8,9441460,9451729,but it is worth it because yes because
7e5SQL_xLN8,9451729,9457300,discipline equals freedom
