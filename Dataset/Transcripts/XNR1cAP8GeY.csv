XNR1cAP8GeY,1991,3740,- [April] I think you should end it a little higher.
XNR1cAP8GeY,3740,4690,- Really? - Yes.
XNR1cAP8GeY,4690,6360,We just really lucked out.
XNR1cAP8GeY,6360,9670,Both Dane and I have tattooed Van Gogh paintings.
XNR1cAP8GeY,9670,13630,We're going to copy this portrait exactly.
XNR1cAP8GeY,13630,15380,- [Dane] Definitely a lot of texture.
XNR1cAP8GeY,15380,18650,"I got the Van Gogh, ah! Jackpot!"
XNR1cAP8GeY,18650,21324,"- This week, we're testing consistency."
XNR1cAP8GeY,21324,23720,"(beep) - Without consistency,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,23720,25390,your tattoo's gonna look awful.
XNR1cAP8GeY,25390,26820,All your lines have to be straight.
XNR1cAP8GeY,26820,28770,Your shading has to be in perfect placement.
XNR1cAP8GeY,28770,30880,It's the most important part of tattooing.
XNR1cAP8GeY,30880,35879,"- Today, you must tattoo a famous work of art."
XNR1cAP8GeY,36430,37540,- Ah. - Some of these
XNR1cAP8GeY,37540,38950,will be really hard.
XNR1cAP8GeY,38950,42220,- Your canvases today all want a world renowned painting
XNR1cAP8GeY,42220,45450,permanently tattooed on their skin.
XNR1cAP8GeY,45450,47910,"From ""Starry Night"" to ""The Birth of Venus,"""
XNR1cAP8GeY,47910,49050,"to ""The Scream."""
XNR1cAP8GeY,49050,50020,These paintings are some
XNR1cAP8GeY,50020,52800,of the most recognizable in the world.
XNR1cAP8GeY,52800,55470,- Fine art paintings have hundreds of hours worth
XNR1cAP8GeY,55470,56900,of layering of paint.
XNR1cAP8GeY,56900,60210,Replicating that into a tattoo is a nightmare.
XNR1cAP8GeY,60210,63350,- You must perfectly replicate your painting down
XNR1cAP8GeY,63350,67490,"to the brushstroke, using consistency to capture the details"
XNR1cAP8GeY,67490,69303,and its overall essence.
XNR1cAP8GeY,70210,71650,But that is not all.
XNR1cAP8GeY,71650,73010,- Of course not.
XNR1cAP8GeY,73010,76203,- We also have a very special guest judge.
XNR1cAP8GeY,77060,79979,He's a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art
XNR1cAP8GeY,79980,82773,"here in New York City, Carter Foster."
XNR1cAP8GeY,84690,86660,- This curator knows everything there is
XNR1cAP8GeY,86660,88770,to know about these kind of paintings.
XNR1cAP8GeY,88770,90869,He's gonna be able to tell every spot
XNR1cAP8GeY,90870,93100,that's not exactly right. - Hi.
XNR1cAP8GeY,93100,95299,I specialize in modern and contemporary art.
XNR1cAP8GeY,95300,96780,You're never gonna get every detail
XNR1cAP8GeY,96780,99369,of that particular work of art into a tattoo form.
XNR1cAP8GeY,99370,101270,So the artists have to make these decisions about
XNR1cAP8GeY,101270,103520,"what they're actually gonna pick out from that work,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,103520,104750,which is not so easy.
XNR1cAP8GeY,104750,107030,- It's not enough to create a great tattoo.
XNR1cAP8GeY,107030,110010,Carter is here to make sure your work looks authentic
XNR1cAP8GeY,110010,112160,and every drop of ink is consistent
XNR1cAP8GeY,112160,114160,with the original painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,114160,117280,"In this elimination tattoo, you must tattoo head to head"
XNR1cAP8GeY,117280,118830,against one other artist.
XNR1cAP8GeY,118830,121170,"- Oh, goddamn it. - Giving an apples"
XNR1cAP8GeY,121170,123430,to apples comparison. - Perfect.
XNR1cAP8GeY,123430,126920,- [Dave] One of you will win and one of you will lose
XNR1cAP8GeY,126920,129410,- Having to replicate any particular piece of art
XNR1cAP8GeY,129410,132320,always shows consistency because you have the actual product
XNR1cAP8GeY,132320,133700,and you have your replication.
XNR1cAP8GeY,133700,135459,There's no room for self interpretation.
XNR1cAP8GeY,135460,136410,- The good thing for you
XNR1cAP8GeY,136410,140920,and me is we have done this tattoo about 30 times.
XNR1cAP8GeY,140920,143319,- I've been the very top of this competition the whole time.
XNR1cAP8GeY,143320,144450,So we gotta kill it.
XNR1cAP8GeY,144450,146300,This is gonna be a really big battle.
XNR1cAP8GeY,146300,148030,Tyler puts me head to head with Chris
XNR1cAP8GeY,148030,149740,because he thinks he's gonna be able to take me out
XNR1cAP8GeY,149740,150971,of this competition.
XNR1cAP8GeY,150971,152110,"(beep) you, Tyler."
XNR1cAP8GeY,152110,153780,We're dealing with a very pale figure
XNR1cAP8GeY,153780,155819,and that's something that we'll be contending with just
XNR1cAP8GeY,155820,156750,with your skin tone.
XNR1cAP8GeY,156750,157583,- Yeah. - No big deal.
XNR1cAP8GeY,157583,158480,Definitely don't stress about
XNR1cAP8GeY,158480,159312,that part. - Okay.
XNR1cAP8GeY,159313,160560,- If they think that they're gonna get me out
XNR1cAP8GeY,160560,161700,"of this competition,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,161700,163720,they've definitely got a big surprise coming.
XNR1cAP8GeY,163720,165370,"- If it's going in between your shoulders,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,165370,167230,"then maybe like, an oval-y shape."
XNR1cAP8GeY,167230,169819,I'm definitely thinking a portion of it.
XNR1cAP8GeY,169820,172244,- Just sit as still as possible.
XNR1cAP8GeY,172244,175590,(machine whirs)
XNR1cAP8GeY,175590,177690,- Goin' with my fine-line.
XNR1cAP8GeY,177690,179580,like some brushstroke-y things.
XNR1cAP8GeY,179580,180810,My strategy for the tattoo is
XNR1cAP8GeY,180810,182860,to do all the brush strokes on it
XNR1cAP8GeY,182860,185160,and make it look like it's old and weathered.
XNR1cAP8GeY,185160,187443,It'll be really painterly when I'm done.
XNR1cAP8GeY,190730,193213,I know Craig is gonna use some goofy ass
XNR1cAP8GeY,193214,195890,(beep) color palette that Craig Foster loves
XNR1cAP8GeY,195890,198010,to (beep) do in every tattoo.
XNR1cAP8GeY,198010,199860,And I'm gonna keep mine true to the painting
XNR1cAP8GeY,199860,201410,and I'm gonna beat Craig's ass.
XNR1cAP8GeY,202790,204650,- I'm just laying down a bunch of blacks
XNR1cAP8GeY,204650,207530,and then I say we get in all the dull colors in there.
XNR1cAP8GeY,207530,210430,There's certain colors that I have seen the judges
XNR1cAP8GeY,210430,213120,go harshly on for doing on certain kinds of skin tones.
XNR1cAP8GeY,213120,216360,So I'm strategically taking out certain colors.
XNR1cAP8GeY,216360,218610,I'm doing what the judges are expecting here.
XNR1cAP8GeY,219480,222433,"- Four hours remaining, four hours to go."
XNR1cAP8GeY,224160,226877,- We'll get this last chunk down here done.
XNR1cAP8GeY,226877,229980,"""Water Lilies"" by Monet is by far the most difficult"
XNR1cAP8GeY,229980,233183,'cause there's so much layering happening in the painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,235540,237939,Duffy and I are choosing to go about this painting
XNR1cAP8GeY,237940,239090,two different ways.
XNR1cAP8GeY,239090,241620,She's using a zoomed in section to tattoo
XNR1cAP8GeY,241620,243860,and I'm using a little bit more of the painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,243860,247023,I want to make sure that the painting is identifiable.
XNR1cAP8GeY,247023,248657,- Did you see Duffy's? - I saw it once
XNR1cAP8GeY,248657,250410,"and it was earlier on, how's she doing?"
XNR1cAP8GeY,250410,251913,- It looks amazing.
XNR1cAP8GeY,254360,257820,- Monet specifically painted his designs to be viewed
XNR1cAP8GeY,257820,258890,from a distance.
XNR1cAP8GeY,258890,261859,"When you get up close on 'em, they're really, really messy."
XNR1cAP8GeY,261859,264490,I need to take this same approach with my tattoo.
XNR1cAP8GeY,264490,265530,So right now I'm just going through
XNR1cAP8GeY,265530,267650,and trying to get shapes where they go.
XNR1cAP8GeY,267650,269240,When you stand back and look at this thing
XNR1cAP8GeY,269240,271740,it's gonna be nice and bright and it makes sense.
XNR1cAP8GeY,271740,274018,This is definitely gonna get me the win.
XNR1cAP8GeY,274018,276520,(upbeat music)
XNR1cAP8GeY,276520,279289,"- I'm finishing up some of these blues in here,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,279290,281490,kind of doing these lighter tones.
XNR1cAP8GeY,281490,284300,My strategy is to try to keep the main elements
XNR1cAP8GeY,284300,286909,in the painting that I feel represent the painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,286910,289550,The only thing that I'm going to move is gonna be the moon
XNR1cAP8GeY,289550,291669,over into the center of the painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,291670,293360,Just so I can get all of the elements
XNR1cAP8GeY,293360,295223,that need to be in this.
XNR1cAP8GeY,299592,300425,- How you doing girl?
XNR1cAP8GeY,300425,301970,- Hanging in. - She's over it.
XNR1cAP8GeY,301970,303811,"- Loving it. - She's not liking me,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,303811,304644,you know?
XNR1cAP8GeY,304644,305560,"- I didn't want ""Starry Night"""
XNR1cAP8GeY,305560,307660,because this thing looks like a (beep) crazy house
XNR1cAP8GeY,307660,309210,of blue tones and yellow tones.
XNR1cAP8GeY,309210,311210,"I don't even know how this person did it with a brush,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,311210,312597,much less how I'm gonna duplicate this
XNR1cAP8GeY,312597,314610,with a (beep) tattoo machine.
XNR1cAP8GeY,314610,316610,Some things just don't work for tattoos.
XNR1cAP8GeY,318399,320970,"- Oh God. - Five,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,320970,325020,"four, three, two, one."
XNR1cAP8GeY,325020,326240,That is it. Time's up.
XNR1cAP8GeY,326240,328483,Machine's down. No more ink.
XNR1cAP8GeY,329496,332240,"- Check it out - Man, this looks awesome."
XNR1cAP8GeY,332240,335349,"- Today, you had to replicate a fine work of art."
XNR1cAP8GeY,335350,337850,Each of you tattooed head to head with another artist
XNR1cAP8GeY,337850,340000,and we will directly compare your work.
XNR1cAP8GeY,340000,342713,One artist will win and one artist will lose.
XNR1cAP8GeY,343660,346173,"Tyler, you went head to head with Craig."
XNR1cAP8GeY,347050,348409,"- [Judge] Tyler, I think you did a great job"
XNR1cAP8GeY,348410,350330,translating this from the original painting
XNR1cAP8GeY,350330,351560,to a tattoo form.
XNR1cAP8GeY,351560,354220,"As far as capturing the feel, the tone,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,354220,356660,"the contrast, it is definitely there."
XNR1cAP8GeY,356660,358340,"- If you look at the original painting,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,358340,361630,there's tiny little white scratchy lines in the face
XNR1cAP8GeY,361630,363920,and you brought those over to the tattoo in a way
XNR1cAP8GeY,363920,365050,that's really well done.
XNR1cAP8GeY,365050,367030,Great use of consistency there.
XNR1cAP8GeY,367030,369080,- It's really hard to get the expression of that face
XNR1cAP8GeY,369080,370405,"and you found a way to do it,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,370406,372170,which is what the most important thing is in this painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,372170,374527,"So well done. - Thanks, guys."
XNR1cAP8GeY,374527,376220,I got this (beep) all day. - Yup.
XNR1cAP8GeY,376220,380010,- Craig. (dramatic suspense music)
XNR1cAP8GeY,380010,382500,- [Judge] Your color choices here are very suspect.
XNR1cAP8GeY,382500,385080,You have colors that don't exist anywhere in the painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,385080,387599,"Magenta, purple, that bright orange"
XNR1cAP8GeY,387600,389980,and peach swoosh to the right of the head.
XNR1cAP8GeY,389980,391480,- I just wanted something that would last
XNR1cAP8GeY,391480,392640,on their skin over time.
XNR1cAP8GeY,392640,394090,So I went with the stronger tone.
XNR1cAP8GeY,394090,395340,- [Judge] It's just not the same look.
XNR1cAP8GeY,395340,396480,It's not the same feel.
XNR1cAP8GeY,396480,398070,- [Dave] I'd also add that yours is looking
XNR1cAP8GeY,398070,400120,in a different direction than the original.
XNR1cAP8GeY,400120,401720,"- I'm happy with it, I had a good time working"
XNR1cAP8GeY,401720,402750,"with it. - Okay, but you're here"
XNR1cAP8GeY,402750,404925,to be critiqued on consistency and-
XNR1cAP8GeY,404925,406449,- I understand. - Not on whether you're happy
XNR1cAP8GeY,406450,409410,"with this, and as far as a consistency challenge,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,409410,410470,pretty far off
XNR1cAP8GeY,411905,412822,- Good job.
XNR1cAP8GeY,413940,416590,"- [Dave] Between Tyler and Craig, do we have a winner?"
XNR1cAP8GeY,416590,418630,- Tyler's attention to detail that he did put
XNR1cAP8GeY,418630,420780,in the face makes this really stand out.
XNR1cAP8GeY,420780,422550,- I agree. That's the best thing about his.
XNR1cAP8GeY,422550,425099,- Winner of this head-to-head competition is Tyler.
XNR1cAP8GeY,426960,430332,"Katie, you went head to head with Duffy."
XNR1cAP8GeY,431180,432490,I'm familiar with this painting
XNR1cAP8GeY,432490,436400,and I'm not entirely sure if I would know what this is
XNR1cAP8GeY,436400,437893,if I was standing next to her.
XNR1cAP8GeY,437893,439030,- I felt like it was very difficult
XNR1cAP8GeY,439030,440600,to translate into a tattoo.
XNR1cAP8GeY,440600,442610,- Your colors are completely different
XNR1cAP8GeY,442610,443942,than the colors in the painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,443942,446509,"In the painting, there's some really bright vivid areas"
XNR1cAP8GeY,446510,448600,of green with a really high contrast.
XNR1cAP8GeY,448600,451860,You made those areas really forest hunter green.
XNR1cAP8GeY,451860,453784,So it changes the painting itself.
XNR1cAP8GeY,453784,456230,You've got one of the harder paintings to reproduce
XNR1cAP8GeY,456230,457790,and one of the hardest parts of the body.
XNR1cAP8GeY,457790,459423,Definitely shows there's a struggle here.
XNR1cAP8GeY,459423,460383,It's a rough one.
XNR1cAP8GeY,463540,464373,- Duffy.
XNR1cAP8GeY,466430,468520,"- [Judge] As far as consistency goes, I do love"
XNR1cAP8GeY,468520,471000,that you were able to capture the brush strokes.
XNR1cAP8GeY,471000,473990,"You've captured the color palette, captured the composition."
XNR1cAP8GeY,473990,476470,You made a lot of really smart choices.
XNR1cAP8GeY,476470,478340,- I would've liked to have seen a little more crispness
XNR1cAP8GeY,478340,480169,in the way the flowers were executed.
XNR1cAP8GeY,480170,482130,But you chose the shape wisely.
XNR1cAP8GeY,482130,483900,"You fit it to the body well, that was smart."
XNR1cAP8GeY,483900,485070,And it's more recognizable.
XNR1cAP8GeY,485070,487100,You see this as a Monet right away.
XNR1cAP8GeY,487100,488477,- Thank you. - Good job.
XNR1cAP8GeY,490030,491400,- Between Katie and Duffy.
XNR1cAP8GeY,491400,492880,Who's gonna take this one?
XNR1cAP8GeY,492880,494800,- [Judge] Duffy really captured the spirit
XNR1cAP8GeY,494800,496150,of the Monet a little bit more.
XNR1cAP8GeY,496150,498139,It definitely has that painterly feel.
XNR1cAP8GeY,498140,500060,I'm leaning towards Duffy's.
XNR1cAP8GeY,500060,501930,- I go with Duffy as well.
XNR1cAP8GeY,501930,503449,- The edge goes to Duffy for me.
XNR1cAP8GeY,503450,506810,- Winner of the head to head challenge is Duffy.
XNR1cAP8GeY,506810,509020,"Matt and Katie, as the veteran artists,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,509020,510410,it's on your shop to prove
XNR1cAP8GeY,510410,513669,that you deserve to be here by overcoming your weaknesses.
XNR1cAP8GeY,513669,516769,"Last time you competed, there was one elimination tattoo"
XNR1cAP8GeY,516770,518979,that landed you both in the bottom.
XNR1cAP8GeY,518979,520169,"- I hope you worked on it, man."
XNR1cAP8GeY,520169,522164,- Now you'll get another crack at it.
XNR1cAP8GeY,522164,523630,- Here it comes.
XNR1cAP8GeY,523630,528190,- There is no better test of consistency than tattooing
XNR1cAP8GeY,528190,530090,a famous work of art.
XNR1cAP8GeY,530090,533003,"- Oh (beep). - Yeah, that's a bummer."
XNR1cAP8GeY,533003,534700,- Of course. - Goddamn it.
XNR1cAP8GeY,534700,536960,"The last time I tattooed a famous work of art,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,536960,538820,it sent me home
XNR1cAP8GeY,538820,540200,"- Using consistency,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,540200,542680,you need to perfectly replicate your painting
XNR1cAP8GeY,542680,544149,down to the brushstroke.
XNR1cAP8GeY,544150,546210,"- Paintings have a million brushstrokes,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,546210,548790,hundreds of hours worth of work put into them.
XNR1cAP8GeY,548790,551730,"And when you only have a few hours to do the tattoo,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,551730,554173,it's almost impossible to get the job done.
XNR1cAP8GeY,555490,557320,"- And for this elimination tattoo,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,557320,561900,you and your teammate will both tattoo on the same canvas.
XNR1cAP8GeY,561900,564600,- Both of you have to do a fair amount of the tattoo.
XNR1cAP8GeY,564600,565730,"The biggest thing about this,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,565730,567740,it needs to look like the painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,567740,570720,"Colors have to be dead on, application has to be dead on."
XNR1cAP8GeY,570720,573370,You have to hit exactly what you see in front of you.
XNR1cAP8GeY,574760,576230,"Today, we want to show consistency"
XNR1cAP8GeY,576230,577410,and that means these artists have
XNR1cAP8GeY,577410,579199,to be very smart about which portion
XNR1cAP8GeY,579200,580620,of the painting they attack
XNR1cAP8GeY,580620,582880,and how they execute that portion.
XNR1cAP8GeY,582880,583960,- That fits nice.
XNR1cAP8GeY,583960,585580,- Replicating the painting stroke
XNR1cAP8GeY,585580,587980,for stroke is not realistic in six hours.
XNR1cAP8GeY,587980,590540,So I'm expecting them to hit the colors
XNR1cAP8GeY,590540,594048,and tones and the actual mood and look of that painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,594048,595740,"- All right, ready? - Bring it."
XNR1cAP8GeY,595740,598740,(upbeat rock music)
XNR1cAP8GeY,599703,601540,- What is tricky is I wanna make sure we get
XNR1cAP8GeY,601540,604000,"what we get, too, 'cause this is a lot of work in this one."
XNR1cAP8GeY,604000,606207,Our canvas came in today wanting the Sistine Chapel's
XNR1cAP8GeY,606207,608079,"""Creation of Adam"" on his chest."
XNR1cAP8GeY,608080,608913,"- You know, the hard part is,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,608913,611210,it's a painting that took years to do.
XNR1cAP8GeY,611210,612930,"Oh, you got six hours. You know what I mean?"
XNR1cAP8GeY,612930,614260,- We're zooming in on the hands
XNR1cAP8GeY,614260,615890,and we're gonna put it on this guy's forearm.
XNR1cAP8GeY,615890,617190,I'm doing the smart thing.
XNR1cAP8GeY,618831,620620,- [April] I think you should end it a little higher.
XNR1cAP8GeY,620620,621570,- Really? - Yes.
XNR1cAP8GeY,621570,623230,We just really lucked out.
XNR1cAP8GeY,623230,626560,Both Dane and I have tattooed Van Gogh paintings.
XNR1cAP8GeY,626560,630520,We're going to copy this portrait exactly.
XNR1cAP8GeY,630520,632260,- Definitely a lot of texture.
XNR1cAP8GeY,632260,634023,"I got the Van Gogh, ah! Jackpot!"
XNR1cAP8GeY,635730,638523,- Four hours remaining. Four more hours.
XNR1cAP8GeY,639800,640930,"- What's up, Katie? - Hey."
XNR1cAP8GeY,640930,643060,- How you doing? - Doing good.
XNR1cAP8GeY,643060,645070,"- Good. - Christian is acting like,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,645070,646120,"all buddy-buddy,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,646120,647870,but I don't know him well enough
XNR1cAP8GeY,647870,650060,to know if he has an ulterior motive.
XNR1cAP8GeY,650060,651440,"- Hey, just so you know,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,651440,655520,Katie's colors are looking very nice and crisp and clean.
XNR1cAP8GeY,655520,658020,- My biggest concern at this point is just making sure
XNR1cAP8GeY,658020,659610,that we win this head to head.
XNR1cAP8GeY,659610,662790,"- So just on the direct, like one-to-one comparison."
XNR1cAP8GeY,662790,664217,- Mm hmm. - He's over there blocking
XNR1cAP8GeY,664217,667990,"(beep) way too dark on that, for this."
XNR1cAP8GeY,667990,669520,- Geez Louise.
XNR1cAP8GeY,669520,671030,"If they wanna do a tribal painting,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,671030,672240,they can do a tribal painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,672240,674200,I'm fine with that. (Matt laughs)
XNR1cAP8GeY,674200,675100,- [Christian] They're doing a nice job.
XNR1cAP8GeY,675100,676430,"I don't think they're gonna flub it at all,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,676430,679070,but I think you're making more accurate color choices.
XNR1cAP8GeY,679070,680410,"- Christian and I are doing a great job,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,680410,681730,working well as a team.
XNR1cAP8GeY,681730,683940,- All we need to do is just execute today.
XNR1cAP8GeY,683940,686600,- We need to prove to Black Cobra that we came here to play
XNR1cAP8GeY,686600,688670,"and no matter what they can produce,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,688670,690910,we're gonna kick 'em in the dirt each time.
XNR1cAP8GeY,690910,695910,"- Five, four, three, two, one."
XNR1cAP8GeY,696240,698550,"That's it, machine's down. Time is up."
XNR1cAP8GeY,698550,699740,No more ink.
XNR1cAP8GeY,699740,701490,- Quit torturing this poor (beep) guy.
XNR1cAP8GeY,701490,702323,"- [Noelin] All right, all right."
XNR1cAP8GeY,702323,703156,"All right, geez."
XNR1cAP8GeY,704200,705940,- Hooray! - You're done!
XNR1cAP8GeY,705940,709300,"- What do you think? - Wow, it's incredible."
XNR1cAP8GeY,709300,710440,Thank you. - Aww.
XNR1cAP8GeY,712918,715020,- Today you had to show consistency
XNR1cAP8GeY,715020,717320,by replicating a famous work of art.
XNR1cAP8GeY,717320,718640,Matt and Katie.
XNR1cAP8GeY,718640,721660,This challenge was designed to test your weaknesses.
XNR1cAP8GeY,721660,723373,"Black Cobra, you're up first."
XNR1cAP8GeY,727090,729770,"You tattooed ""Dancers at the Bar"" by Degas."
XNR1cAP8GeY,729770,731210,- [Judge] You did a great job capturing the look
XNR1cAP8GeY,731210,732043,of this painting.
XNR1cAP8GeY,732043,734670,I don't think that anybody could realistically match up
XNR1cAP8GeY,734670,736839,"stroke per stroke everything in the painting,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,736840,738700,but capturing the feel and the mood
XNR1cAP8GeY,738700,740670,and the tone are the big things for me.
XNR1cAP8GeY,740670,743040,Y'all really did a great job with that.
XNR1cAP8GeY,743040,744673,"- Awesome. - Appreciate it, thanks."
XNR1cAP8GeY,746260,747093,- Basilica.
XNR1cAP8GeY,749620,752240,"You tattooed ""Dancers at the Bar"" as well."
XNR1cAP8GeY,752240,753870,"Obviously you're competing with the room,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,753870,755170,"but in this particular case,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,755170,757160,you went head to head with Black Cobra.
XNR1cAP8GeY,757160,759730,- The whole thing is just missing that punchy black.
XNR1cAP8GeY,759730,761510,"Anywhere where there's an outline on this painting,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,761510,763480,"it is really heavy black, like tar."
XNR1cAP8GeY,763480,765889,You guys don't look as deliberate with your black
XNR1cAP8GeY,765890,767260,as the painting looks.
XNR1cAP8GeY,767260,768850,Black Cobra really punched it in
XNR1cAP8GeY,768850,771190,and that's what makes it really strong.
XNR1cAP8GeY,771190,772420,This is a tricky day
XNR1cAP8GeY,772420,774649,because the guy that you think's gonna take it
XNR1cAP8GeY,774650,776390,to the end can be gone today.
XNR1cAP8GeY,776390,778023,So hit these things hard.
XNR1cAP8GeY,781160,782683,- Classic Trilogy Tattoo.
XNR1cAP8GeY,784900,787830,"You tattooed ""Creation of Adam"" by Michael Angelo."
XNR1cAP8GeY,787830,790510,- [Judge] Definitely the most consistent tattooing
XNR1cAP8GeY,790510,792110,that I've seen from you guys.
XNR1cAP8GeY,792110,794230,- I like the crack elements of the ceiling.
XNR1cAP8GeY,794230,797760,"The anatomical reproduction is really, really nice."
XNR1cAP8GeY,797760,800230,And there's just no doubt as to what this thing is.
XNR1cAP8GeY,800230,802480,I would not have expected this from you guys.
XNR1cAP8GeY,804126,804959,"- We did that, all right."
XNR1cAP8GeY,804959,806910,- Pins and Needles.
XNR1cAP8GeY,806910,809149,"You tattooed ""Banks of the Seine"" by Manet."
XNR1cAP8GeY,809150,811250,- I think y'all captured the look of the painting
XNR1cAP8GeY,811250,813040,"but if you get in and start looking at it,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,813040,814360,"the boat shape isn't the same,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,814360,815820,"the horizon line isn't the same,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,815820,817870,the shape of the trees isn't the same.
XNR1cAP8GeY,817870,821400,Those structures in the back are totally lost in the tattoo.
XNR1cAP8GeY,821400,823760,But you guys definitely worked your ass off
XNR1cAP8GeY,823760,826240,"to get the textures, to get the brush strokes."
XNR1cAP8GeY,826240,829000,The look of the painting is primarily achieved.
XNR1cAP8GeY,829000,830423,"- Thank you. - Thank you, guys."
XNR1cAP8GeY,831500,833023,- Artistic Skin Design.
XNR1cAP8GeY,833990,837779,"You tattooed ""Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat"" by Van Gogh."
XNR1cAP8GeY,837780,840080,- You definitely got the brushstroke feel.
XNR1cAP8GeY,840080,842410,"For this painting to work,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,842410,844850,"it is capturing the warmth, the palette,"
XNR1cAP8GeY,844850,846569,"the feel, the direction."
XNR1cAP8GeY,846570,849620,"And you guys did that, so way to not buckle under pressure"
XNR1cAP8GeY,849620,851410,and just work within your means.
XNR1cAP8GeY,851410,852759,- Thanks. - Thank you.
XNR1cAP8GeY,854390,856670,"- Judges, time to announce tattoo of the day."
XNR1cAP8GeY,856670,858779,- [Judge] Classic Trilogy really made a smart play
XNR1cAP8GeY,858780,860850,and turned potentially nightmare
XNR1cAP8GeY,860850,863480,"into a small, clean, very legible tattoo."
XNR1cAP8GeY,863480,865779,But as far as capturing the overall look
XNR1cAP8GeY,865780,867870,"of a whole painting, Artistic Skin Design"
XNR1cAP8GeY,867870,869310,really nailed it for me
XNR1cAP8GeY,869310,871580,- Artistic Skin Design's the one and only.
XNR1cAP8GeY,871580,873860,- The judges have decided the best tattoo
XNR1cAP8GeY,873860,876691,of the day goes to Artistic Skin Design.
XNR1cAP8GeY,876691,881691,- Thank you. (upbeat rock music)
