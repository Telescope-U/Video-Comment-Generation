7E-nCgExajM,399,2879,50 years of a legally enshrined right to
7E-nCgExajM,2879,4880,abortion in the united states has been
7E-nCgExajM,4880,6879,brought to an end after the country's
7E-nCgExajM,6879,9599,supreme court decided to overturn its
7E-nCgExajM,9599,12559,landmark ruling made in 1973.
7E-nCgExajM,12559,14880,it means that tens of millions of women
7E-nCgExajM,14880,16960,across the u.s do not have their right
7E-nCgExajM,16960,18800,to an abortion guaranteed by the
7E-nCgExajM,18800,21600,constitution and individual u.s states
7E-nCgExajM,21600,23680,are now legally entitled to ban the
7E-nCgExajM,23680,24880,procedure
7E-nCgExajM,24880,27279,nearly half of america's 50 states are
7E-nCgExajM,27279,30000,expected to do so and 13 have already
7E-nCgExajM,30000,32160,passed so-called trigger laws which
7E-nCgExajM,32160,34480,outlaw or severely restrict abortion
7E-nCgExajM,34480,36160,automatically following the court's
7E-nCgExajM,36160,38960,ruling it is a momentous decision which
7E-nCgExajM,38960,42079,has delighted and enraged americans well
7E-nCgExajM,42079,44160,our north america editor sarah smith is
7E-nCgExajM,44160,48559,at the supreme court for us now sarah
7E-nCgExajM,49520,51680,protests have been growing here outside
7E-nCgExajM,51680,54640,the court all day as people absorb this
7E-nCgExajM,54640,56640,dramatic news whether you agree with the
7E-nCgExajM,56640,59199,ruling or not this is a seismic moment
7E-nCgExajM,59199,61680,in america as almost five decades of
7E-nCgExajM,61680,63600,guaranteed abortion rights have been
7E-nCgExajM,63600,66890,immediately and totally reversed
7E-nCgExajM,66890,70159,[Applause]
7E-nCgExajM,70159,72479,this is a huge historic moment for
7E-nCgExajM,72479,75039,america
7E-nCgExajM,75759,77439,as they hear the news from the court
7E-nCgExajM,77439,78799,there's jubilation from
7E-nCgExajM,78799,79900,anti-abortionists
7E-nCgExajM,79900,83169,[Applause]
7E-nCgExajM,84320,87119,life won today they chant celebrating a
7E-nCgExajM,87119,89680,victory after almost 50 years i've seen
7E-nCgExajM,89680,91920,the devastation abortion has brought on
7E-nCgExajM,91920,94720,our country on a communal level and on a
7E-nCgExajM,94720,97680,personal level and this is so
7E-nCgExajM,97680,100320,vindicating to know that we can now take
7E-nCgExajM,100320,103040,tangible steps to lessen the violence of
7E-nCgExajM,103040,105040,abortion in our country 10 years ago did
7E-nCgExajM,105040,107520,you ever imagine this would happen
7E-nCgExajM,107520,110960,i imagined it a lot but i still
7E-nCgExajM,110960,113040,people told me it was impossible that we
7E-nCgExajM,113040,114880,would never see this kind of victory and
7E-nCgExajM,114880,117280,now i know that victory is not only
7E-nCgExajM,117280,119280,possible it's happened
7E-nCgExajM,119280,120799,so we are going to
7E-nCgExajM,120799,122880,work off of this momentum we're going to
7E-nCgExajM,122880,124880,keep going we're going to keep fighting
7E-nCgExajM,124880,129078,and we're going to build a better world
7E-nCgExajM,130080,132400,fury from those campaigning to keep the
7E-nCgExajM,132400,134959,guaranteed right to abortion promising
7E-nCgExajM,134959,137280,to fight back it's not the will of the
7E-nCgExajM,137280,138800,people and this country is supposed to
7E-nCgExajM,138800,141920,run off of the will of the people i'm 21
7E-nCgExajM,141920,144239,and i'm terrified we have a lot of work
7E-nCgExajM,144239,146319,to do but to make that happen but we
7E-nCgExajM,146319,148640,will never give up it's 50 years since
7E-nCgExajM,148640,150239,there was last significant decision on
7E-nCgExajM,150239,151760,abortion rights in america it might be
7E-nCgExajM,151760,153599,another 15. sure
7E-nCgExajM,153599,155040,but we're not going to stop it doesn't
7E-nCgExajM,155040,156560,matter it doesn't matter what they say
7E-nCgExajM,156560,158319,again abortions will continue they just
7E-nCgExajM,158319,160319,won't be legal and women will die from
7E-nCgExajM,160319,162319,botched abortions
7E-nCgExajM,162319,164560,it's obvious this ruling is not going to
7E-nCgExajM,164560,166480,end the arguments over abortion in
7E-nCgExajM,166480,169519,america in fact it will inflame them in
7E-nCgExajM,169519,172239,this deeply polarized society abortion
7E-nCgExajM,172239,174560,is already one of the most divisive
7E-nCgExajM,174560,176400,issues
7E-nCgExajM,176400,178400,even the president is powerless to
7E-nCgExajM,178400,180159,change the court's ruling with this
7E-nCgExajM,180159,181760,decision
7E-nCgExajM,181760,183519,the conservative majority of the supreme
7E-nCgExajM,183519,186000,court shows how extreme it is
7E-nCgExajM,186000,188080,how far removed they are from the
7E-nCgExajM,188080,190879,majority of this country
7E-nCgExajM,190879,192640,they made the united states an outlier
7E-nCgExajM,192640,195760,among developed nations in the world
7E-nCgExajM,195760,197440,but this decision
7E-nCgExajM,197440,201440,must not be the final word
7E-nCgExajM,202319,204159,abortion rights have been fought over
7E-nCgExajM,204159,207040,for decades good evening in a landmark
7E-nCgExajM,207040,209840,ruling the supreme court today legalized
7E-nCgExajM,209840,212959,abortions in 1973 the supreme court
7E-nCgExajM,212959,215040,ruled in the test case of roe versus
7E-nCgExajM,215040,217120,wade that women must have access to
7E-nCgExajM,217120,219920,abortion across america a decision
7E-nCgExajM,219920,222000,totally reversed today
7E-nCgExajM,222000,224959,it is my profound honor to be the first
7E-nCgExajM,224959,228400,president in history to attend the march
7E-nCgExajM,228400,231200,for life
7E-nCgExajM,231200,233360,as president donald trump deliberately
7E-nCgExajM,233360,235599,appointed three pro-life justices to the
7E-nCgExajM,235599,238239,court making today's ruling possible he
7E-nCgExajM,238239,240959,says god made the decision in fact it
7E-nCgExajM,240959,243599,was six of the nine judges by a vote of
7E-nCgExajM,243599,245120,six to three
7E-nCgExajM,245120,247439,the court affirmed
7E-nCgExajM,247439,250080,that the power to protect unborn life is
7E-nCgExajM,250080,252840,returned to the people and their elected
7E-nCgExajM,252840,255200,representatives the people have won a
7E-nCgExajM,255200,257160,victory
7E-nCgExajM,257160,260278,[Music]
7E-nCgExajM,260479,262560,anti-abortion activists view today's
7E-nCgExajM,262560,265120,victory as merely a first step they will
7E-nCgExajM,265120,267199,now take their campaigns to every state
7E-nCgExajM,267199,269360,which continues to allow terminations
7E-nCgExajM,269360,271040,trying to get abortion banned in the
7E-nCgExajM,271040,273600,whole of the united states sarah smith
7E-nCgExajM,273600,277040,bbc news washington
7E-nCgExajM,277040,278960,well as we mentioned earlier there are
7E-nCgExajM,278960,281680,13 so-called trigger states which
7E-nCgExajM,281680,283199,already have laws in place to
7E-nCgExajM,283199,285440,immediately ban abortion now that roe
7E-nCgExajM,285440,288000,versus wade has been overturned one of
7E-nCgExajM,288000,290479,them is arkansas whose attorney general
7E-nCgExajM,290479,293680,has this evening signed the ban into law
7E-nCgExajM,293680,295520,our correspondent sophie long has had
7E-nCgExajM,295520,297680,special access to an abortion clinic in
7E-nCgExajM,297680,299840,the state which is now having to turn
7E-nCgExajM,299840,301759,women away and there are distressing
7E-nCgExajM,301759,304400,details in her report
7E-nCgExajM,304400,307199,it was exactly the ruling they'd been
7E-nCgExajM,307199,309840,dreading but the expectation didn't make
7E-nCgExajM,309840,311840,the court's decision any less
7E-nCgExajM,311840,313680,devastating
7E-nCgExajM,313680,315919,abortion is murder
7E-nCgExajM,315919,318720,it's just been upheld
7E-nCgExajM,318720,321759,outside they had to turn women away
7E-nCgExajM,321759,323520,this isn't a country that i ever thought
7E-nCgExajM,323520,325039,i would know
7E-nCgExajM,325039,328000,i thought that
7E-nCgExajM,328639,331120,this country would still care about
7E-nCgExajM,331120,332400,people
7E-nCgExajM,332400,334720,would still care about women
7E-nCgExajM,334720,336960,inside they had to come to terms with
7E-nCgExajM,336960,338960,the fact that the care they provided
7E-nCgExajM,338960,342080,here is now a criminal offence
7E-nCgExajM,342080,343600,i don't think there's a waiting period
7E-nCgExajM,343600,344400,there
7E-nCgExajM,344400,346080,but it is about a five and a half hour
7E-nCgExajM,346080,348319,drive
7E-nCgExajM,349759,351600,and see it's like having to turn women
7E-nCgExajM,351600,352400,away
7E-nCgExajM,352400,354400,like
7E-nCgExajM,354400,356639,what sucks
7E-nCgExajM,356639,358639,jennifer thompson first came here as a
7E-nCgExajM,358639,361360,patient she says her abortion saved her
7E-nCgExajM,361360,363919,life and the care she received here
7E-nCgExajM,363919,365919,inspired her to train so she could do
7E-nCgExajM,365919,368240,the same for others i have to tell them
7E-nCgExajM,368240,370080,i'm sorry but there's nothing i can do
7E-nCgExajM,370080,372240,for you i'm sorry that your boyfriend
7E-nCgExajM,372240,373840,beats you every day and that he rapes
7E-nCgExajM,373840,375120,you all the time there's nothing i can
7E-nCgExajM,375120,376639,do you're gonna have to find somewhere
7E-nCgExajM,376639,377759,else to go
7E-nCgExajM,377759,379120,i mean i can give him information to
7E-nCgExajM,379120,381039,help him try but it's heartbreaking man
7E-nCgExajM,381039,382960,like you know this place saved my life
7E-nCgExajM,382960,385199,literally
7E-nCgExajM,385199,387280,for more than 10 years dr willie parker
7E-nCgExajM,387280,389440,has traveled here from another state
7E-nCgExajM,389440,391280,because the restrictive laws and the
7E-nCgExajM,391280,393680,threat of violence or financial ruin has
7E-nCgExajM,393680,395840,long been too great for local doctors to
7E-nCgExajM,395840,398240,carry out abortions here themselves i
7E-nCgExajM,398240,401360,feel angry in the way that anybody who
7E-nCgExajM,401360,402800,is deeply
7E-nCgExajM,402800,405840,vested in human rights should feel angry
7E-nCgExajM,405840,408960,and outraged and indignant anytime they
7E-nCgExajM,408960,411199,are witnessing injustice
7E-nCgExajM,411199,413919,we will come to recognize the full cost
7E-nCgExajM,413919,416800,of criminalizing abortion when we start
7E-nCgExajM,416800,419120,to see the bump in the rise in maternal
7E-nCgExajM,419120,421759,mortality and morbidity suffering and
7E-nCgExajM,421759,423840,death related to conditions that are
7E-nCgExajM,423840,426880,unique to pregnancy
7E-nCgExajM,426880,428720,i put that to the woman who fought back
7E-nCgExajM,428720,430880,tears of joy as she signed arkansas's
7E-nCgExajM,430880,433840,almost total ban on abortion into law it
7E-nCgExajM,433840,436479,makes no exception for rape or incest a
7E-nCgExajM,436479,438800,termination can only take place now in
7E-nCgExajM,438800,441280,the case of maternal medical emergency
7E-nCgExajM,441280,443680,well i don't know if that doctor has any
7E-nCgExajM,443680,444639,facts
7E-nCgExajM,444639,446639,to base that
7E-nCgExajM,446639,449120,hypothetical answer on we we don't have
7E-nCgExajM,449120,451440,any information to to base that
7E-nCgExajM,451440,453360,conclusion that this doctor has come up
7E-nCgExajM,453360,456000,with and hopefully you know this
7E-nCgExajM,456000,457840,this law that we're putting in place
7E-nCgExajM,457840,459840,specifically says to save the life of a
7E-nCgExajM,459840,461520,mother
7E-nCgExajM,461520,463759,for the anti-abortion protesters outside
7E-nCgExajM,463759,466160,the clinic this is a good day
7E-nCgExajM,466160,468479,we will not fully celebrate until
7E-nCgExajM,468479,470479,abortion is eradicated fully from our
7E-nCgExajM,470479,472879,land until little our family planning
7E-nCgExajM,472879,475680,services for example is closed down and
7E-nCgExajM,475680,477759,does not reopen then we can celebrate
7E-nCgExajM,477759,480240,for sure
7E-nCgExajM,480639,482800,they will continue their fight but the
7E-nCgExajM,482800,484160,supreme court's ruling will
7E-nCgExajM,484160,486080,fundamentally change the course of the
7E-nCgExajM,486080,488160,lives of all the women who passed the
7E-nCgExajM,488160,490720,protesters every day to provide the care
7E-nCgExajM,490720,492879,they did here along with those of

7E-nCgExajM,500560,503120,let's talk to sarah smith now sarah such
7E-nCgExajM,503120,505199,a hugely consequential decision this
7E-nCgExajM,505199,507840,what happens now
7E-nCgExajM,509039,511520,well already several states have enacted
7E-nCgExajM,511520,513680,immediate bans on abortion and more will
7E-nCgExajM,513680,516080,follow in the days and weeks to come
7E-nCgExajM,516080,517760,you heard president biden there saying
7E-nCgExajM,517760,520000,he thinks this is a sad day for america
7E-nCgExajM,520000,521839,well even though he and the democrats
7E-nCgExajM,521839,523919,control the white house and both houses
7E-nCgExajM,523919,525920,of congress there's nothing they can do
7E-nCgExajM,525920,528160,about this supreme court ruling and the
7E-nCgExajM,528160,530240,democrats don't have enough votes in the
7E-nCgExajM,530240,532160,senate to be able to pass a new law that
7E-nCgExajM,532160,535040,would guarantee abortion rights so for
7E-nCgExajM,535040,537920,now president biden says what he can do
7E-nCgExajM,537920,540480,is try to make sure that women who want
7E-nCgExajM,540480,542320,abortions but live in states that have
7E-nCgExajM,542320,544640,banned the procedure are able to travel
7E-nCgExajM,544640,546480,to other places where the termination
7E-nCgExajM,546480,548800,can still be performed places like new
7E-nCgExajM,548800,550720,york state which now says it's a safe
7E-nCgExajM,550720,553519,haven for women seeking the procedure
7E-nCgExajM,553519,554320,and
7E-nCgExajM,554320,556720,this really radical decision that has
7E-nCgExajM,556720,559760,come from this very conservative supreme
7E-nCgExajM,559760,562320,court it's not necessarily going to stop
7E-nCgExajM,562320,564959,here we heard one of the justices today
7E-nCgExajM,564959,567040,making it clear that he thinks that the
7E-nCgExajM,567040,568640,court should now revisit some other
7E-nCgExajM,568640,570560,progressive rulings the ones that
7E-nCgExajM,570560,573040,guarantee things like access to abortion
7E-nCgExajM,573040,575600,or legalize same-sex marriage it's
7E-nCgExajM,575600,577600,possible that the court could look again
