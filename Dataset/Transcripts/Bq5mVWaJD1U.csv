Bq5mVWaJD1U,4799,11440,we're live let me move my campfire this  other cam  those are all other guys
Bq5mVWaJD1U,11440,18320,today we're taking a look at a lot of  cool stuff i want to take a look at  first the cam specs as i promised last  night or take a look at the 2.2 liter
Bq5mVWaJD1U,18320,24320,dodge and i got two cams from the guys  at elgin  i think these have been sitting around
Bq5mVWaJD1U,24320,32160,for a long time but 2.2 liter turbo cam  so take a look at the specs on those  then this right here is a custom cam
Bq5mVWaJD1U,32160,37760,done for the 3800 for the big bang motor  so what about the specs on those you
Bq5mVWaJD1U,37760,44760,guys can give me your opinion on the cam  specs  so that's this one right here
Bq5mVWaJD1U,45039,51039,whoa  so we'll talk about that then we are  going to take a walk over as you saw
Bq5mVWaJD1U,51039,56399,hopefully from the thumbnail that the  400 pontiac is on the dyno
Bq5mVWaJD1U,56399,62160,and  uh ready to start so we'll start it up  and see what's going on
Bq5mVWaJD1U,62719,67760,i went through all the preliminary stuff  already with the pontiac it does have it  did it oil pressure it had good oil
Bq5mVWaJD1U,67760,73520,pressure we um actually cranked it over  i didn't even take the distributor out
Bq5mVWaJD1U,73520,79040,the gentleman that responsible for  putting this thing down together did a  fantastic job all the rockers were tight
Bq5mVWaJD1U,79040,85040,and the valves were all adjusted as it  turns out this thing also has uh  scorpion roller rockers i didn't know
Bq5mVWaJD1U,85040,90079,that i took out the valve covers today  and so having the rockers that's an  awesome deal
Bq5mVWaJD1U,90079,95520,the uh i never moved the distributor and  it excuse me i just put the quadrajet on
Bq5mVWaJD1U,95520,102560,there put the intake manifold on there  you know went through the process that  we normally do when we're going through  checking things on the motor and the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,102560,108640,thing fired right up so awesome job  we'll uh we'll go in and we'll start it  and then we'll go over some things that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,108640,114960,i got to change obviously before we  start making some polls and then we'll  start making some polls it'll be it'll  be cool so i'm hoping to do a bunch of
Bq5mVWaJD1U,114960,121119,testing tonight like i said right now it  has the stock intake manifold on it the  saw cast iron intake manifold and a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,121119,127600,quadrajet of some variety maybe the one  that came with it maybe the one that  came off of it and then i also have the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,127600,132640,two barrel and cast iron intake manifold  and then i also have a holley but it's a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,132640,138080,it's a performer and not an rpm and i'm  hoping my buddy andy comes through with
Bq5mVWaJD1U,138080,144080,an rpm uh we'll find out how much power  it's going to make sometime tonight  probably not on the live feed but
Bq5mVWaJD1U,144080,150560,sometime tonight i'll find that out and  we can figure out whether or not a poll  from last night was accurate or not
Bq5mVWaJD1U,150560,156480,we'll see if this thing makes more than  300 horsepower which would be cool what  i'm expecting is given the fact that it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,156480,161840,has the early heads on it has  compression in it so this thing at the  very least is going to make some good
Bq5mVWaJD1U,161840,166879,torque numbers i'm i'm thinking it's  going to be over one foot-pound per  cubic inch so that will be good and
Bq5mVWaJD1U,166879,173120,again don't know exactly what the cam is  but i know i'm going to have to go  through and i've got to
Bq5mVWaJD1U,173120,178560,put some  extensions some collector extensions on  the headers and i may even put mufflers
Bq5mVWaJD1U,178560,184400,on it we'll have to see  but i want to put some collector  extensions on that's going to help the  torque but more than anything these
Bq5mVWaJD1U,184400,190480,headers don't have provisions for an  oxygen sensor and i will need that to  tune this thing i'm hoping that we have
Bq5mVWaJD1U,190480,196800,some uh metering rods for the quadrajet  so that i can at least get it close and  we can make it so that it's you know
Bq5mVWaJD1U,196800,202400,doing kind of what it's supposed to even  if i can't get it exact as long as we  can get it in the ballpark i can kind of
Bq5mVWaJD1U,202400,208480,get an idea and then i also have a an  adapter to go to to allow us to put that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,208480,214400,quick fuel carburetor on there so we can  put the quick fuel carburetor on the  factory four barrel intake using a q-jet
Bq5mVWaJD1U,214400,219440,holley adapter that we have and then we  can also run the holley on the edelbrock
Bq5mVWaJD1U,219440,225200,because i think that the edelbrock has  two bolt patterns on the manifold so i  think that that will bolt right on so
Bq5mVWaJD1U,225200,231120,it'll be interesting to see what happens  we'll we'll see how all of that pans out  and we also have the camshaft upgrade
Bq5mVWaJD1U,231120,236480,for it that we could do i need to check  and see one of the things they don't  know about the con the configuration
Bq5mVWaJD1U,236480,242799,that it's in right now it does have  roller rockers on it what it might have  is a stock cam and stock springs and
Bq5mVWaJD1U,242799,249439,roller rockers although it looks like  these are not stock springs and it also  looks like these have been shimmed so
Bq5mVWaJD1U,249439,255040,somebody  did some work i think to these cylinder  heads and i didn't take a spring off to
Bq5mVWaJD1U,255040,260560,test it we wanted we're just going to  test it on the dyno and see what happens  we'll know
Bq5mVWaJD1U,260560,268240,when because if they are if this is a  stock you know production flat tapping  cam and these are stock of pontiac
Bq5mVWaJD1U,268240,275199,springs it would have come on a 400  then with the roller rockers we should  probably get into valve float fairly
Bq5mVWaJD1U,275199,280960,early and we'll be able to tell that and  then maybe we would need to do the  spring upgrade with just the rockers
Bq5mVWaJD1U,280960,287199,certainly with the camshaft and that and  that will come later a lot of times when  i do these tests comparing a stock
Bq5mVWaJD1U,287199,292479,camshaft to aftermarket camshafts we'll  go ahead and configure the motor with
Bq5mVWaJD1U,292479,298320,better springs to begin with because the  better springs aren't really going to  affect the stock cam shaft too much in  fact if anything it might allow it to
Bq5mVWaJD1U,298320,304160,rub out a little bit farther and then  when we put the other camshaft in then  all we're doing is a cam swap that's
Bq5mVWaJD1U,304160,309360,fairly easy so starting off with  something that already has springs we do  that a lot on the ls stuff we'll run
Bq5mVWaJD1U,309360,314560,when i do a comparison between a stock  cam and a  you know a truck norris cam or best cam
Bq5mVWaJD1U,314560,320240,or sloppy stage 2 cam  the motor almost always has springs on  it because i know i'm going to run lots
Bq5mVWaJD1U,320240,325840,of cam shafts so we put the springs in  it anyway and just kind of get it all  prepped
Bq5mVWaJD1U,326160,331360,so hopefully i can do lots of testing on  that tonight i want to get through all  the intake manifolds i have to say the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,331360,337199,one thing on the pontiac  that i don't like on the is the is the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,337199,342320,intake manifold and i know how guys hear  this but  i don't like the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,342320,348400,the intake manifold pushing up with the  o-ring i don't i don't like that um  [Music]
Bq5mVWaJD1U,348400,356400,i don't like that fix  what i'd like to see is a tube  you know with an o-ring or um the other
Bq5mVWaJD1U,356400,363280,thing that that some people do with the  pontiacs is they'll cut that front part  off of the other manifolds and then if
Bq5mVWaJD1U,363280,369759,you're doing a manifold swap assuming  that you've done that to the other  manifolds as well if you're it is that  we just leave that in place so that the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,369759,376080,water you don't have to ever disturb the  water passage then you can just do dry  intake manifold swaps and that's a lot
Bq5mVWaJD1U,376080,382880,faster and more expedient  but i'd like to see a better connection  there you know rather than the way that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,382880,389039,they run that o-ring um i'd like to see  it like i said  a tube or a hose or clamp or you know
Bq5mVWaJD1U,389039,395840,something that that  that i would feel better about obviously  lots of guys are running it and it works  fine it's just that it wouldn't be my
Bq5mVWaJD1U,395840,402639,first choice so right now it has water  in it and it's not leaking so  obviously it works fairly well but i
Bq5mVWaJD1U,402639,408880,just don't have a warm fuzzy feeling  about it so it's it's my one thing i'm a  pontiac that i would like to change
Bq5mVWaJD1U,408880,414960,so let's let's get going on our um so  let's see we'll we'll uh
Bq5mVWaJD1U,418160,423520,so here's our poll for tonight on the  stock
Bq5mVWaJD1U,423520,430560,400  intake  will the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,430560,435599,quick fuel  carb  make
Bq5mVWaJD1U,435599,441440,more  power  than the q-jet
Bq5mVWaJD1U,441440,447039,and for you guys that are going to ask i  have no idea what size the q-jet is i  don't know what size the quick feel is
Bq5mVWaJD1U,447039,452560,it's just those  so
Bq5mVWaJD1U,452560,457840,more quick fuel carbon  looks like for an intake the fox stock
Bq5mVWaJD1U,457840,464400,400 cast iron intake will the  will the adapted uh  quick fuel carburetor make more than the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,464400,470479,q jet so we can go over our cam chest i  think i'll start with this is the 3800
Bq5mVWaJD1U,470479,476560,big bang cam chef so this is the one  that i chose to work with the ported  heads from turbo monza hopefully those
Bq5mVWaJD1U,476560,482639,will be done pretty soon with bigger  valves and they're already flowing  pretty well enough to make you know a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,482639,489120,bajillion horsepower once we started  adding boost to it but i wanted to have  a good camshaft for it and i don't know
Bq5mVWaJD1U,489120,495440,if i didn't give the 220 cam that we had  from the guys at zz performance
Bq5mVWaJD1U,495440,500479,uh a fair shake it didn't seem to add a  lot of power over the 210 220 cam that i
Bq5mVWaJD1U,500479,506240,had from comp  it just didn't add what i thought it  should have and so i i just had one done
Bq5mVWaJD1U,506240,513200,in specs that i thought would work and  we'll talk about those  that right now this is a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,513200,518240,589  593 lift with our v6 cam
Bq5mVWaJD1U,518240,524320,and but  that is with a one-nine rocker  so i'm gonna have to step up to the gzp
Bq5mVWaJD1U,524320,531680,one nine rockers because the people that  did this cam for me  this is only a 310 312 lobe lift so we
Bq5mVWaJD1U,531680,538160,had to get a lot of rocker ratio to get  this thing up in the lift where i  thought it would work especially once  the heads are poured and now that they
Bq5mVWaJD1U,538160,545040,are we can take advantage of that i  think it will work better and it will  make more power it is a 226 to 40 degree
Bq5mVWaJD1U,545040,550320,duration so we've stepped up from the  zzzp cam and it is a dual pattern cam
Bq5mVWaJD1U,550320,557600,which is what i like  it's a pretty good spread it's 14  degrees  this has a 113 degree low separation
Bq5mVWaJD1U,557600,564240,angle it's a 106 on the intake and 117  on the exhaust and as i said a one nine
Bq5mVWaJD1U,564240,569680,rocker which i'm hoping that they have  in stock i need to check now that now  that i've reminded myself i want to make
Bq5mVWaJD1U,569680,576720,sure that that's um that that's there  and that i can run it we have enough  valve spring to run 600 lift so that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,576720,583040,shouldn't be a problem i have the 26 918  springs on it and the zzp
Bq5mVWaJD1U,583040,590560,retainers will go on there so i'll  double check and make sure what i want  to do is in addition to making sure we
Bq5mVWaJD1U,590560,596399,have enough retainer to seal and coil  buying clearance with which i think we  have both of those i also want to make
Bq5mVWaJD1U,596399,601519,sure that i get this thing  if we can it and it may already be there
Bq5mVWaJD1U,601519,608160,but i'd like to get it within 30  thousands or so of coil bite because  we'll get some stability if we do that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,608160,614399,so we'll we'll see how all that plays  out we'll see what the installed height  and i'm going to measure each one of  them to make sure that they're the same
Bq5mVWaJD1U,614399,619600,because the i know on the factory head  they didn't seem to all be cons that  consistent so
Bq5mVWaJD1U,619600,624640,there'll be a little bit of shimming and  stuff going on but i think that that  camshaft will work
Bq5mVWaJD1U,624640,631120,so let let me know let me know what you  guys think will that cam work for the  big bang once we add boost to it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,631120,637279,and these are a couple of uh elgin cams  for the 2.2 liter
Bq5mVWaJD1U,637279,643560,this first one is  where my specs is
Bq5mVWaJD1U,644850,647918,[Music]
Bq5mVWaJD1U,658640,663760,i'm gonna have to check on those  i thought that they were in the box i  thought that my cam cards were there i'm
Bq5mVWaJD1U,663760,667800,gonna run over there and check and see
Bq5mVWaJD1U,692320,698800,nope they are not there but if anybody  has access to the um elgin
Bq5mVWaJD1U,698800,704640,catalog it is an e 875  is one of them and the other one is an
Bq5mVWaJD1U,704640,710880,e826s  so if somebody is uh  has their computer handy they can go on
Bq5mVWaJD1U,710880,716399,and search that and we can figure out  what the specs are on those two  camshafts i'm gonna try both of them if
Bq5mVWaJD1U,716399,722720,i remember right i thought one of them  was an n a cam maybe and one of them was  a turbo cam and we'll see how they how
Bq5mVWaJD1U,722720,728480,they compare to the factory stuff and  and hopefully  you know the way that it is usually with
Bq5mVWaJD1U,728480,733600,a lot of this factory stuff is  the factory cams are fairly mild
Bq5mVWaJD1U,733600,738720,and i and i say that  um  i haven't seen a situation where factory
Bq5mVWaJD1U,738720,744320,cams  have been the ultimate although i have  been told that many times i just put in
Bq5mVWaJD1U,744320,750639,camden's waste of time factory already  knew what they were doing they they work  great  i can guarantee you that the factory
Bq5mVWaJD1U,750639,756480,wasn't designing their stuff to make  maximum power that's that's never that's  never the thing
Bq5mVWaJD1U,756480,761600,um so what do you guys think about the  camshaft on the 3800 is that is that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,761600,767519,going to work is that going to allow us  to take advantage of  let's say all of the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,767519,773600,uh gt45 turbo which is going to be 750  or something like that or will the motor
Bq5mVWaJD1U,773600,780720,break before that happens will the  bottom end break before that happens or  the next step up is some sort of 78.75
Bq5mVWaJD1U,780720,786959,or that kind of deal um that's going to  take us to the area between the 750 and
Bq5mVWaJD1U,786959,792959,the 1000  if it gets if it gets to four digits  that will that will certainly be a win
Bq5mVWaJD1U,792959,798240,that that will be uh junkyard money will  spent and and lots of other money from
Bq5mVWaJD1U,798240,804160,custom cams and one nine rockers and  heads and all kinds of stuff so but you  know that's that's part of the deal um
Bq5mVWaJD1U,804160,812000,i'm excited about that i'll be excited  when i am able to i've already taken the  motor down to the short block and taken
Bq5mVWaJD1U,812000,817760,all the  taking the camshaft out of the front  dress all that stuff so it's basically  ready for me to
Bq5mVWaJD1U,817760,823600,do the  the ring gap on it and then it will be  prepped basically ready to go i'm also
Bq5mVWaJD1U,823600,829760,going to put head studs arp head studs  and obviously mls gaskets on it because
Bq5mVWaJD1U,829760,837519,we don't want it just blowing a head  gasket because it's got those  um  you know factory graphite ones or
Bq5mVWaJD1U,837519,842720,non-mls gaskets any kind of non-mls  gasket we want we want there to be some
Bq5mVWaJD1U,842720,848639,head gasket strength and we want that  not to be the  the weak link so hopefully that stuff
Bq5mVWaJD1U,848639,854399,all go together and then we'll have  enough clapping force and enough  strength in the gasket and we'll be able
Bq5mVWaJD1U,854399,860720,to turn the sun thing up to wherever the  you guys can decide piston or rod
Bq5mVWaJD1U,860720,866959,decides hey look that's i wasn't  designed for that kind of power we're  not doing this anymore and and that's  gonna happen you know it's gonna be a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,866959,873040,rod or piston normally so let's go take  a look at the pontiac now
Bq5mVWaJD1U,873040,879360,we can take a walk in there  see i think i'm all juiced up yep
Bq5mVWaJD1U,880959,886160,take this out  take a walk in take a walk on the wild
Bq5mVWaJD1U,886160,891199,side  and we're walking yes indeed and i'm
Bq5mVWaJD1U,891199,896639,walking  yeah  you know you're all jealous of that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,897199,904320,yeah two barrel  two barrel intake manifold
Bq5mVWaJD1U,905279,910560,that's all good stuff  so we're going in the dino uh something
Bq5mVWaJD1U,910560,917120,cool that was here at west tech today is  somebody had a 1969 z28 and you guessed
Bq5mVWaJD1U,917120,923839,it it had a dz 302 in it he was actually  driving it around and had stock exhaust  manifolds and a dual exhaust it had the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,923839,929120,original camshaft and heads all intake  manifold all that on it and he had put a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,929120,934720,one of the four whole throttle body fuel  injections on it and he drove it all the  time the four-speed car you know house
Bq5mVWaJD1U,934720,940399,tooth interior it was like the real deal  i was talking to for a while it's an  awesome car
Bq5mVWaJD1U,940399,947360,and i love the fact that he's driving it  and that also that he's doing his own  thing to it it's not not the numbers
Bq5mVWaJD1U,947360,954000,matching restoration deal with the right  kind of paint swatch on it and all that  stuff but here is our pontiac it's up on
Bq5mVWaJD1U,954000,960240,the dyno obviously got the fancy headers  on there  look at that  had a little do had to do a little bit
Bq5mVWaJD1U,960240,966000,of clearancing over here  as you can see  things get a little tight with the oil
Bq5mVWaJD1U,966000,971360,filter  with our line to run up so that we can  have oil pressure um we had to do a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,971360,977680,little you know little persuasion here  to get this to clear mostly under on the  underside here
Bq5mVWaJD1U,977680,984079,so that so we could um our line could  clear  but i put the you can see i put the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,984079,990880,the not so sexy valve covers on there  the reason that i did that we took these  off which would look really really nice  and i'm hoping that they that these are
Bq5mVWaJD1U,990880,997090,run in the car  i'm just going off my camera here
Bq5mVWaJD1U,997090,1004240,[Music]  swing  so this
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1004240,1010959,this is much better it's castle luma  it's got a it's got a nice um receiver  for the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1010959,1017600,valve cover gasket and that's part of  the problem as we'll see when we start  this  these stamped steel ones
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1017600,1024000,um you can see i've already got a piece  here  yeah there we go you see right here
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1024000,1029280,we've already got um it's leaking so i  don't know if the gasket has um kind of
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1029280,1034480,looped forward  away from the rail i'm going to take  that i have to take that off and if i
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1034480,1039839,have to i'll put those on the reason i  took them off is because we were going  to be taking these off and doing swaps
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1039839,1047120,and adjusting rockers and doing stuff i  just didn't want to scratch those up i  want those to be in nice condition when  they go back and go in the motor i mean
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1047120,1052559,go back in the car so i just didn't want  to be you know putting my grubby  fingerprints and stuff all over you can
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1052559,1059679,see we put a just a single belt just to  so that the um  crate pulley could drive the water pump
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1059679,1065120,we got our fancy uh q-jet here  that was one that was just
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1065120,1070400,sitting there in the garage  it's got it's got the hei in the back  you see
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1070400,1076799,he made all wires for it which is very  cool all those fit  all the plugs are in
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1076799,1082960,got the uh super richie as you can see  drive by wire
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1084000,1091600,so what we can do is go get the dyno  prepped  and we can start it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1093440,1102840,so i'm up take a walk  yes indeed i'm walking  so we're gonna go in here for a second
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1108320,1111360,okay so
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1116320,1123720,put our pumps on  that's all good i'll be right back
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1228640,1235840,okay what i'm going to do is i'll start  it up and then i'll take you guys in  there so you guys can hear the broom  broom broom
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1237760,1244400,in fact it's pretty boring in here why  don't you just go in there  right now hang out
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1244400,1253159,be cool dino  guys because if you were you'd be the  only cool dino guy here
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1272880,1276280,you guys good

Bq5mVWaJD1U,1557440,1560440,so
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1572880,1578960,yeah it's working it's alive  it's working it's got go pressure
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1578960,1586080,got lots of oil pressure  which we like  which i'm liking
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1597279,1602640,walking by the fan getting fan wash  okay let's see you guys got going on
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1602640,1606960,tonight  tonight
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1609279,1614799,okay  i think we're looking good there yeah  we're still looking good so hang on with
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1614799,1617039,that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1620159,1624840,come on camera there we go
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1632400,1640360,follow me follow me follow me  come on camera  man
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1645360,1650320,yeah the microphone's gonna pick up it's  pretty loud i'm sure
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1652799,1658399,damn still having trouble with this  thing  the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1658399,1664320,dan actually the motor i think is  already broken in if you look in the uh  and i'm gonna do one
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1664320,1670159,but  i i think that this thing has already  been run i think that this is actually a  used short block but we'll go through a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1670159,1677880,break-in procedure anyway and as you can  as you can see i don't know why this is  this thing's starting to make the  manager
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1685600,1691760,there we go so i i think it's already  broken in i'm going to do a break-in  procedure anyway just to be sure
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1691760,1698320,and you saw i have a couple other things  i've got to cure that oil leak um either  that valve cover either the valve cover
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1698320,1704880,gaskets folded in or it's just that  those stamped steel ones don't have a  lot of rigidity in the center
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1704880,1711520,either in either case i can put the  other valve covers on which are cast  aluminum they're flat and so they have a  good flange on them that will seal
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1711520,1716640,perfectly i also have to put the  collector extensions on so that i can  put an o2 uh
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1716640,1721840,meter in there so i could put a o2  sensor in there we can get a reading on  the dyno because obviously we want to
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1721840,1726880,make sure that the air fuel is right  when we're doing this and make sure and  i'm going to take a look at the timing
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1726880,1732080,too  and  we'll i'll adjust the timing we'll start  out like we always do we'll start out
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1732080,1738399,with something low  20 degrees or 25 degrees or something  and and roll into it and kind of see
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1738399,1744399,what's going on  i think judging by the way that the  thing was running and idling i mean it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1744399,1751039,was idling at like 650 rpm  i'm thinking stock cam  i don't have a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1751039,1756320,vacuum gauge hooked up to it right now  but i will i'll hook the the vacuum  gauge from the dyno up to it that way we
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1756320,1762399,can see what the idle vacuum is down at  600 or so kind of get an idea that will  give us a really good indication of
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1762399,1768880,what's going on with the camshaft  so we've got to do that  let's see the oil leak the oxygen sensor
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1768880,1773919,we'll hook the vacuum up um  disconnect the vacuum advance on the  distributor
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1773919,1780159,and  we have already  uh we've already put stops on the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1780159,1787440,internally on the hei because that thing  has probably  35 or 40 degrees of centrifugal swing in
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1787440,1794000,it so we wanted to limit that so that we  can have a normal kind of thing where  you have you know 10 or 15 degrees of of
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1794000,1800880,initial and then 20 or 25 degrees of  total and then that way you can get a  good combination of the two
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1800880,1806320,so we want to see  you know we're going to play with a  little bit i think that all of the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1806320,1812399,seems like all the like i said i checked  the valve lash and all this it's all  good the i think has a lot of oil
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1812399,1818960,pressure it had 75 pounds when we were  doing that so that's quite a bit  i got new oil for it so after we do the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1818960,1824000,break-in and stuff we'll probably put  some new oil in it but it seems like  it's working good you know thumbs up to
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1824000,1830320,the  to the gentleman who built the car who  built the motor that's that's awesome um  i like when they go on there and they go
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1830320,1835600,together and ever and everything's right  like i said when  all i did was
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1835600,1840640,give it a little bit of gas touch the  starter and and it fired right up which  is you know exactly what you want from
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1840640,1846799,your motor  um  so i'll be testing that tonight and i'm
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1846799,1853120,have my fingers crossed that the two  barrel will cooperate and we'll be able  to make some runs with that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1853120,1858960,and then the hopefully the edelbrock  will show something and we'll see what  happens with the carburetor sometimes
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1858960,1864320,i've had not great luck with adapters  trying to put a holley on a quadrijet or
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1864320,1870000,quadrat on a holley sometimes um but  we'll you know that's why we test we'll  see what happens so what do you guys got
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1870000,1872320,going on
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1876240,1881919,uh what rpm you're planning to run the  3800 to i don't know  we'll have to see where it wants to make
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1881919,1888480,power  have you seen the specs on the gmp 632 i
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1888480,1896000,i have seen the power output but not the  not what the heads flow or the cam specs  or any of that stuff
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1899600,1906720,chirping only no sound  got a 455 illuminati voodoo cam
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1906720,1913039,former rpm intake 6x4 heads with a  little part work that's a good  combination
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1913679,1919200,the collector extensions will on this  like they do on everything it's it's  definitely going to help
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1919200,1925600,low speed power in fact i would like to  put mufflers on it but i think that the  mufflers that i have
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1925600,1931600,for the three inch exhaust  are welded to the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1931600,1938640,extensions that we have for the ls that  have a v band on them and these don't  have a v band i mean that can all be  welded on there but i don't think that's
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1938640,1943039,necessary we'll just probably just put  collector extensions on it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1946559,1952000,i i did find the um cam specs on the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1952000,1956440,on the pontiac cam if that was your  question
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1963600,1969679,it took a couple of minutes for the  lifters to pump up to sound alike i i  didn't notice that and i didn't see that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1969679,1974200,when we were doing oil pressure either
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1976000,1982480,i should hook up the dinosaur fan to the  engine for boost it it is it's it's a  fairly serious evacuation fan
Bq5mVWaJD1U,1982480,1991080,unfortunately it doesn't  blow air in and it blows it sucks it out  so it would create vacuum
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2002399,2010000,i wonder what the one nine rockers that  will lose valve control early probably  not with as much spring pressure as we  have but we'll see
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2012799,2019760,quadrijets for the wind so on our pole  we're looking at 60 saying yes
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2019760,2026240,that the quick field will make more than  the quadrant forty percent saying no  she's got some quad jet fans out there
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2029840,2036559,do you have an adapter you can run the  two-barrel on the four-barrel manifold i  don't  know if we do i don't know if we have a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2036559,2041679,2g  adapter to a quadrajet i'd have to look
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2041679,2047600,and see there's a lot of adapters over  there or a lot of spacers and stuff  we've got a bunch of wilson spacers but
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2047600,2055679,most of them are for those um  44 12 or 44 15 or so i think 4412
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2055679,2060800,like circle track  500  cfm2 barrels to go on four-barrel
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2060800,2068320,manifolds which is what they run so i  know there's a bunch of those there but  i don't know about 2g to quadrijet
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2072839,2080158,uh does the quick feel have down leg  boosters you know i don't remember it's  in the other room
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2084079,2090240,you know how much boost the 340 can  handle  reliably it will reliably handle seven
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2090240,2094440,pounds without any problem
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2106320,2112320,the uh dan these these heads don't run  out of flow at 400 lift
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2114160,2119839,the quick fuel carburetor is like a  holley  hook the phantom to the exhaust that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2119839,2122240,would work
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2129119,2134240,richard you should test with the spacer  on the q jet well if we run the if we
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2134240,2140720,run the quick fuel it will have a spacer  i don't know if i think we do have two  jet spacers over there we can try it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2140720,2147040,uh i i've never seen something that  loves plenum volume i've yet to see  plenum volume make a difference on
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2147040,2154240,anything i have seen spacers make a  difference  especially when you go from a dual plane
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2154240,2159520,intake that's divided  to an open spacer but that's not
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2159520,2164200,changing it because it's changing plenum  volume
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2189359,2196160,so mike you try to snag all the q-jets  off of big blocks i don't see a lot of  those in the wrecking yards
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2196160,2201838,i do like i do like you just but don't  see a lot of them in the junkyards
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2205520,2212000,what about the excel super ram plenum  are you talking about  are you making a statement that the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2212000,2219200,plenum volume is what changes the power  output on a super ram because it's not  the difference between a super ram and a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2219200,2224320,regular factory tuned port is that  you're dramatically changing the runner  length
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2224320,2232240,and on an excel super ram the lower  intake flows more than the factory tune  part does and the runners do also and as
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2232240,2235359,i said they're also shorter
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2239280,2247680,are the head stock pontiac heads  normally don't go over 400 horsepower  they float 210 cfm at 400 left
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2253680,2260240,and i don't even know any i don't know  obviously the q jet is supplying fuel  because the motor starts and it revs it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2260240,2266240,takes throttle and stuff so i just don't  know anything about it it was just  sitting in the garage next to an intake
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2266240,2271839,manifold so i don't know  if it's what it's tuned for
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2271839,2276800,that it even works whether it leaks it  seems like it's okay so far
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2280240,2287040,are you planning on using the electric  distributor on in the future you mean  the  um what if they have a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2287040,2294359,it's not a protronix it's something like  that though right now it just has the  ati on it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2301680,2309119,i know she didn't run the stock efi  intake on your recent ford tests  uh which one
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2309119,2313838,the one where we tested the cams or
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2327760,2334079,i've got a 350 with an unknown cam  pretty choppy  heels have pretty high compression
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2334079,2340160,rotating by hand  would i be somewhat safe with 150 shots
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2340160,2346000,yeah if you return the timing with  nitrous the nitrous is um very cold and  it's actually
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2346000,2349640,works really well
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2367599,2373440,there we don't have an msd distributor  um there is a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2373440,2377520,it's not a bitronix but it's something  like that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2381599,2388280,put some tunnel parts on yeah  it's just some tunnel parts we have  laying around
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2398720,2405040,if i have some ac mechanics out there  they're welcome to go change the line on  my uh  on my silverado that's what it turned
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2405040,2411760,out to be us  mark sanchez and i were looking at last  night and  i'm gonna have to get a new line the uh
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2411760,2417839,compressor is turning on and turning off  so there's not very much pressure in  there and you can see where oil is
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2417839,2425040,leaking out of the line  it's leaking out by the fitting it's not  a schrader valve but gm has the one with
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2425040,2431680,a little  it's like a little plastic bb valve or  whatever there's some coming out of  there you can upgrade that to a schrader
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2431680,2438240,valve but the the line is bad so i need  to change that line and then we can  obviously fill it back up and hopefully
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2438240,2445359,it'll work  oh yeah charles we didn't run those with
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2445359,2450839,um  with fuel injection
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2450839,2457839,because the fuel injection will  definitely hold back especially the  bigger motors i didn't want the fuel  injected manifolds to be the limiting
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2457839,2462759,factor  in terms of the head flow
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2466800,2474240,rocky rotella has wrote a couple of  books on pineapple engines he says 20  horsepower from a spacer on a 400-ish  455. i just wonder would it be there i i
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2474240,2481520,just  and maybe it will maybe it will get  exactly 20 or whatever  but i don't like these kind of absolute
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2481520,2486560,things that spacers on pontiacs make  this kind of power  there there's no way that that's an
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2486560,2491760,absolute thing there's no way that it  does that on a 326 a stock 326 or a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2491760,2496960,stock 350 or a you know 500 horsepower  deal or 600 or what you know it doesn't
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2496960,2503440,do it on all of them um  it did it on the one that he tested if  if he tested it and showed dino results
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2503440,2510240,of it it did it on that one  what it will do on this and like i said  i've tested enough spacers over the last
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2510240,2516000,30 years that  it varies a lot depending on what intake  you test it on not not it doesn't care
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2516000,2522079,that it's a pontiac it doesn't care that  it's a buick or cadillac  it cares more about what the carburetor
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2522079,2527440,is and what the power output is and what  the flow needs are and then whether it's  a divided intake or not like i said
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2527440,2535240,we've tested spacers a lot on single  plane intakes and i've yet to have it do  very much
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2551359,2556880,on the 400 we're going to run some tests  with it hopefully a camshaft and some  different intakes and stuff and then
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2556880,2560759,it's actually going to go in a car
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2566319,2572160,always change the dryer system is leaked  down we're going to evacuate it um first  before we do that mark's pretty good at
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2572160,2575160,it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2580240,2585280,the spacer probably won't work in the  rammer set up on the car i don't even  know and somebody if there are other
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2585280,2590560,pontiac guys here i this is one of the  questions i had for the people that were  putting the engine in the car
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2590560,2595599,is this has the they have the air  cleaner assembly and stuff for the ram  air
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2595599,2601599,for the hood  but i don't know if the like if it has  an edelbrock intake manifold on it and a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2601599,2608640,holiday carburetor i don't know if that  setup will work  or if you put the stock intake manifold
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2608640,2615359,and then you had an adapter  and then put the holley carburetor on  there with a quick fill carburetor if  that would still work i'm wondering if
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2615359,2621040,you're  locked into running the factory intake  manifold and a q-jet and then this
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2621040,2628160,assembly i just i just don't know i  don't know  i don't have a lot of experience with  that ram error setup
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2633280,2639119,uh jerry the i would say that the 274  makes more than an e303 everywhere
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2639119,2644200,maybe not at 1500 but everywhere else
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2652240,2657480,russell do you have a stock 440 like  from a motorhome
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2667599,2672838,uh didn't you and freiberg have a bet  about spacers we did
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2676640,2682359,i don't have the 400m engine anymore  casey
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2691359,2696880,so russell what do you want for the 440  hopefully it's like 12 or something
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2696880,2702720,around a drop blade drop based air  cleaner that's might be possible  grammar for camshaft
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2702720,2707920,like to see what it really did that  would be interesting i'd like to try  some of those things and see i i but i
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2707920,2714079,would think pontiac guys out there would  know what that is but i would like to  try that and see i i honestly think that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2714079,2720079,a modern camshaft is probably going to  be better even than this we were talking  about that with there's a hemi in there
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2720079,2725440,now  um  but i would like to talk about um i was
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2725440,2731760,talking about with james  the  all of these old myths about 440s and
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2731760,2739119,340s  and all these things you know everybody  wants purple cams and that kind of stuff  and he's just like you know that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2739119,2743240,not 1969 anymore
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2747200,2754960,turn the air cleaner lid over it we do  need to do that i don't even think i  don't think we have a stock one here  that i would like to do the wow
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2756079,2761599,although i i got to tell you guys about  my first startup on this thing because  troy was here i'm gonna have to tell
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2761599,2768720,troy unless he's watching  um  on the first startup this thing had like  a 5 000 rpm idols
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2768720,2775839,so i'm like okay well obviously it has a  hole somewhere it has a big vacuum leak  or the carburetor's not tightened down i
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2775839,2781599,was thinking it has a big um pipe plug  or something out of the intake manifold  you know that cause that kind of thing
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2781599,2787280,happened i thought that i checked all  that stuff and i thought that everything  was sealed up because i thought that i  put vacuum caps over all the provisions
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2787280,2793920,and stuff and i thought well maybe  there's something underneath one of the  big pipe plugs wasn't there i thought  that i checked all three of those um
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2793920,2799920,then i thought well the intake manifold  is not seated on the gaskets or whatever  so i'm like okay i wonder what's going
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2799920,2805280,on so i went in there i'm looking around  i'm like you know it's like the i check  the throttle the throttle's not open i
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2805280,2811119,checked the primaries and then i looked  into the secondary  and that's where i found the bolt
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2811119,2817520,i found the bolt that was stuck in  between the throttle blade and the side  of the carburetor so it's holding the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2817520,2823280,secondaries open and it was a bolt  which is not good if that falls in so
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2823280,2828960,after taking that out so important  safety tip check your check your  quadrijet carburetor for a spare i
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2828960,2834000,didn't know both it was a  header bolt or something like that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2834000,2838880,so that was a  lucky save
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2843599,2850400,dan they do have a they have a  supercharged um budget hemi over here  i think it's really good for a boat
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2850400,2857880,motor or something  i know he does still owe me 20 bucks for  that that's right
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2866720,2873839,uh have you done much testing on spacers  using a holley sniper no i would like to  do that  really i would not like to do that with
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2873839,2879839,a  four whole throttle body kind of thing  because i think that that's gonna be  problematic what i would well i'd like
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2879839,2885119,to include that actually too to see  what's going on is as long as the thing  would cooperate and be
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2885119,2890720,repeatable for every combination that we  put it on  but what i'd like to do is i'd like to
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2890720,2896400,run a port injected like a single plane  intake manifold which i have on some i  think i have an ls one i think i have a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2896400,2902480,big block one  i'd like to run that  with a four hole throttle body and then  put a spacer on it and see if it does
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2902480,2909440,anything  see if the plenum volume change because  that's all you're gonna get with that i  guess you could get some kind of airflow
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2909440,2914640,tape or something maybe into the  manifold maybe that would be a little  bit better i'd like to try that and see
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2914640,2920640,and then try the same thing with a  carburetor and see what's see if there's  a change one way or the other see if
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2920640,2928680,it's plenum volume or see if it's signal  to the carburetor i'd kind of like to  test it and see what's going on
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2939040,2945760,yes herb adams i remember reading all  about his stuff he did lots of  suspension stuff
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2955599,2962240,i don't know about annulars or um down  leg boosters for drivability i don't i  don't i certainly have never done that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2962240,2968800,test  uh tom i'm in southern california right
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2968800,2971800,now
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2988240,2994000,i'd love to see a comparison of old  bolt-ons that were popular back compared  to the modern bolt-ons love to see the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,2994000,3000319,difference on how far technology has  come  versus older technology they made good  power back in the day if you look at
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3000319,3006160,that kind of stuff and and putting a  holley carburetor on is  i don't know that a modern holley
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3006160,3013838,carburetor is going to be better than a  holley carburetor that we would have had  back in the day it depends on how far  back you go i guess
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3018000,3023200,yeah it would not uh t it would not have  been good if that bolt would have  dropped in
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3023200,3027000,that would have ruined our day
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3033839,3039359,russell oh you're an irvine yeah you're  not too far away i i went to uci for
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3039359,3042720,two a year or two years
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3049280,3055839,somebody should loan you mickey  thompson's pony cross ram intake  manifold that is pretty cool
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3058720,3065440,what do you think about visor's unequal  length header seems legit but it  wouldn't  it would have to be dependent on other
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3065440,3072319,stuff that's going on  again it's like the absolute things for  anything i i don't think that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3072319,3078680,it's so easy to find the the one time  when that's not gonna work
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3082960,3087599,how long have they been running blowers  for who who's they
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3093599,3099119,dakota my brother has a mickey thompson  cross ramp for a 389 that's kind of cool
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3101440,3107280,that's the other thing is this this  factory manifold has the heat crossovers  that i didn't i just used the gaskets
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3107280,3113119,that were there i would imagine that  they make gaskets where those are  covered so that they don't have the heat
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3113119,3120680,crossover  i'm the way they're running it on the  dyno i don't know that's going to be an  issue anyways but
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3124880,3131680,jerry the xc 274 is the best street  daily small block park cap ever i don't  know that that's the case i i think uh
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3131680,3138839,there was there are  um combinations that i would put a  smaller cam in than that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3140640,3147040,non-heat conductive phenolic resin  spacers create plenum volume sometimes  it will early testing
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3147040,3152160,actually the um the phenolic spacers  that they had in five liters didn't
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3152160,3158640,create plenum volume if that's what  you're talking about they created runner  length because they were spacers between
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3158640,3166000,two portions of the runner  whether it's on a factory efi you know  the ho intake manifold the gt40 any of
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3166000,3171760,the gt40 base manifolds the cobra or the  downs box or any of those if you if it
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3171760,3177760,had individual holes in it that's just  runner length albeit not a lot a quarter  inch or half inch or however big those
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3177760,3181160,spacers were
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3188400,3194800,fe engines in chicago i actually have  access to an fe engine i think after  this pontiac the i probably will
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3194800,3200960,take the guy up on the fe  what's the best compression ratio for na
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3200960,3208720,but with option to use nos  nos isn't  isn't a consideration for not having um
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3208720,3215599,high compression like boost is you can  lots of guys run nitro through with  really really high compression motors so
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3215599,3219480,i wouldn't worry about that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3222400,3230599,subaru people swear by unequal length  headers i don't know what the  i don't know why that is
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3243839,3250079,i know somebody's talking about dave  advisor doing this for a long time he  has been doing it for a really long time
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3250079,3254240,i i like dave we get along great i  talked to him
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3257280,3262720,remember test years ago a stock pontiac  intake was hard to beat aftermarket  intake was not much better a lot of
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3262720,3268640,times when we do intake tests and we and  doesn't matter what we're testing it on  a forward or chevy or dodge whatever
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3268640,3275760,a pontiac  the test motor  a lot of times helps determine what the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3275760,3281440,gains are  so if we have a stock motor with a stock  intake and the stock
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3281440,3287359,four barrel and headers or whatever  the stock manifold probably does really  well
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3287359,3292960,because it's not it doesn't have enough  motor to take advantage of maybe the  other intake flows more or could
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3292960,3299440,potentially make more power  but it doesn't because of a very mild  test motor when we have more motor which
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3299440,3304480,is like what i did with the 393 and the  333 and the 306
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3304480,3311280,as we go up more in power we saw one  thing that the head kept making
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3311280,3316400,more power and more specific power  but if you also notice that when we did
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3316400,3321440,head upgrades on each of those things  even though we were testing them all
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3321440,3326799,against the stock head when we did head  upgrades as we went up in more capable
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3326799,3332000,motors the gains that we got from those  heads increased dramatically
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3332000,3339119,so we have combinations you can now take  advantage of that thing  if we test that thing on a stock motor
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3339119,3344240,it like it's a head it's a cam you know  a camshaft will definitely change it but  a head or an intake manifold we're not
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3344240,3350799,going to see big gains on stock or  stockish motors like we would on more  you know wilder combinations and i think
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3350799,3355119,that that's certainly the case on intake  manifolds
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3357359,3362960,blocking off the heat crossovers worth  20 horsepower too nice so if i could  just get a spacer that blocks off the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3362960,3367318,heat crossover i can get 40 horsepower
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3378400,3384400,500 horsepower fe i would think that a  390 could do that if you do the math
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3384400,3391760,you know a 390 to 400 inch motor making  500 horsepower is not is not you know
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3391760,3398079,out of the realm of possibility i don't  know how well the edelbrock fe heads  flow i'm hoping that they
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3398079,3402359,they gotta float 250 right
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3409599,3414880,what's the max compression ratio 496  with an option for nos there isn't one
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3414880,3421599,the the you can run as much compression  as you could possibly put in that 496  and then run nitrous on it and it will
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3421599,3427760,work fine  the thing that will dictate that is what  the octane of your fuel is that you're
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3427760,3430760,using
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3432799,3438480,so you can run nine to one ten to one  eleven twelve thirteen whatever you  think is going to work really well and
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3438480,3441680,then add nitrous to that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3445200,3451520,hey richard if if headers are worth 50  horsepower over cast manifolds on engine  what are they worth
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3451520,3459040,on a turbo versus cast iron manifolds i  i don't agree that headers are worth 50  horsepower over cast manifolds
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3459040,3463440,maybe there's an application where  that's the case
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3464559,3470480,but there's no correlation between those  two things  between dna motor and the turbo motor
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3470480,3475838,because it we're starting off on a false  statement
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3479839,3485440,planet x are cool do you use oil  restrictors and ls combos with vs racing  turbos
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3485440,3490720,no i don't  and the the restrictor for the oil
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3490720,3497480,usually is a function of whether  sometimes whether it's a journal bearing  or a ball bearing
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3503520,3508960,20 horsepower per heat plug range  i did i didn't even check these i  honestly don't think i even checked the
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3508960,3514838,gap i just saw that they were gapped  down which i liked
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3524079,3530400,stock fees truck variety 200-ish to 220.  but what about a what about an edelbrock
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3530400,3537680,head how much more do they flow than  stockman because i'm told that the  edelbrock pontiac head works really well  on these
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3543599,3550880,uh i bet money as spacer will get better  results with a cast iron dual plane with  a quadrajet
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3550880,3557599,so you think and i don't know what  you're comparing there  are you saying that a spacer will make a
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3557599,3563359,difference with the quadricep  like just putting a  running the quadrijet on the manifold
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3563359,3570079,and then putting a quadrijet spacer and  then putting the quadrijet back on there  you're saying that that's going to work  better
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3570079,3576079,i can i can guarantee you that if we put  an open spacer on a dual plane intake  manifold it's going to change the air
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3576079,3578319,fuel
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3582960,3589040,if you have over 100 volumetric  efficiency will manifold vacuum show  boost no it won't but you do have
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3589040,3595839,pressure waves going in providing  cylinder filling  and that you can see that
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3595839,3603280,if you want to see that in action take a  do a do a search for john kazi um
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3603280,3609280,what is it advanced engine  management advanced engine technology  conference
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3609280,3616000,and and he made a clear intake port and  stuck his finger in there and you can  see the pressure waves wiggle his finger
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3616000,3621440,because the the pressure waves are going  reflected waves that's why they call  them that they go back and forth and
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3621440,3626480,they travel at the speed of sound and  there's a lot of them  and those pressure waves are bombarding
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3626480,3632079,your combustion chamber and helping  cylinder filling that's actually  positive pressure you're not going to
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3632079,3636760,see that as boost but you can see it in  action
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3643520,3652440,what happened to predator carburetors i  haven't i don't know that i've ever i've  never run one here and i don't think  i've seen one run one here either
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3658000,3663400,yeah if anybody has flow numbers on the  edelbrock head that's fine
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3671920,3679319,airflow research makes an fe head  that would surprise me
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3687760,3693359,oh  cute yet guys  i i like sean murphy we have one of his
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3693359,3696920,carburetors here
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3699680,3706040,we haven't flipped the lid upside down  randall  i i don't have a lid
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3722960,3728960,uh  yes i mean if he take it oh my god
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3731039,3736480,cutler's uh butler cnc ported pontiac  heads flow 380 are those
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3736480,3741838,are those edelbrock castings or does he  do his own
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3745920,3752480,a kendig's car but i've never heard of  that  i remember big bigfoot running twin um
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3752480,3756558,twin predators on which i thought was  kind of cool
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3761200,3765400,trick flow makes an effie head
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3768559,3774640,uh out of the box d port  is that an edelbrock head dakota that  flows 270. so that's that's enough to
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3774640,3778838,support way over 500 horsepower
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3784640,3789599,a self-adjusting carb is that like a  variable venturi carburetor
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3792240,3797359,aftermarket ram  air 5 pontiac heads cnc portrayed claim
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3797359,3800480,to flow 500.
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3805599,3811480,you remember the four valve ls heads  that came out in the early 2000s
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3811520,3817359,i try to remember who did those  stupid camera
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3818720,3824599,464 versus 454 chevy versus 440.
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3826720,3833680,the 440 magnum is  uh  hindered by  head flow on those combinations
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3833680,3838720,there are  there are good factory 429 and 460 heads
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3838720,3847078,and good factory  454 heads but there's not an equivalent  440 head
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3854640,3859680,illume rock performer rpm fe throwing  270 cfm see that's enough to make good
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3859680,3864720,power and then maybe with some clean out  that it goes over 300
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3864720,3872760,what what is a kaufman head i the only  kaufman i know is chris kaufman from the  old ford days
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3881760,3888160,what's the best place to draw a boost  reference from for the wastegate and  blow-off valve on a small block chevy
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3888160,3894400,if it's a  whiskey is it a carbureted blow through
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3894400,3898720,thing i i like taking them from the  intake manifold
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3900960,3905519,oh grooves that's right it was a mercury  marine deal right
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3906160,3913079,and they were um i thought that they  were big too were they ls7 based
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3922319,3929680,electric flow heads  kaufman racing equipment heads  aftermarket pony head gets okay
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3929680,3935760,boost reference right off the charge  pipe no don't do that  here  a boost reference off the charge pipe
Bq5mVWaJD1U,3935760,3939920,for the blow off health isn't going to  do anything
