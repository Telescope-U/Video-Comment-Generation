CR9Qen2TDgA,40960,42719,p.m now
CR9Qen2TDgA,42719,44320,morning coffee happening we'll be
CR9Qen2TDgA,44320,46000,heading down there shortly i've been
CR9Qen2TDgA,46000,47440,reading some of the comments about
CR9Qen2TDgA,47440,49280,yesterday's vlog which i had a blast
CR9Qen2TDgA,49280,50640,filming and i had a blast and enjoyed
CR9Qen2TDgA,50640,53039,that table so much lingling is one of my
CR9Qen2TDgA,53039,54399,favorite players to have ever played
CR9Qen2TDgA,54399,56719,with she was an absolute blast and a
CR9Qen2TDgA,56719,58719,great sport she was openly talking about
CR9Qen2TDgA,58719,60239,bluffing she was giggling she was
CR9Qen2TDgA,60239,62320,laughing talking in hands everyone at
CR9Qen2TDgA,62320,63760,the table some of us were some of them
CR9Qen2TDgA,63760,65680,were drinking just like a really fun
CR9Qen2TDgA,65680,68880,atmosphere okay hence camera i wanted to
CR9Qen2TDgA,68880,70240,get some of this for you all because
CR9Qen2TDgA,70240,71920,it's really really funny so i got a few
CR9Qen2TDgA,71920,73280,of the clips in the hands and she was
CR9Qen2TDgA,73280,74799,fine with it and she was laughing along
CR9Qen2TDgA,74799,78080,with it so uh a lot of uh hubble bub
CR9Qen2TDgA,78080,80159,about nothing okay i would not do this
CR9Qen2TDgA,80159,81759,to a random guy who's just sitting there
CR9Qen2TDgA,81759,83520,staring and boring you know what i mean
CR9Qen2TDgA,83520,85520,but like she was clearly the personality
CR9Qen2TDgA,85520,88960,type who you know was engaging and fun
CR9Qen2TDgA,88960,91040,and like i actually thought she played
CR9Qen2TDgA,91040,92720,scare she's hard to play against because
CR9Qen2TDgA,92720,94079,she's super aggro she just didn't run
CR9Qen2TDgA,94079,96079,very well i didn't think um like that
CR9Qen2TDgA,96079,97759,hand when the guy had when shawn had
CR9Qen2TDgA,97759,100799,kings you know but anyway uh we're
CR9Qen2TDgA,100799,102640,lighting up people we were just having
CR9Qen2TDgA,102640,104560,fun and i would not film her or i
CR9Qen2TDgA,104560,106000,wouldn't even release it if she wasn't
CR9Qen2TDgA,106000,107600,comfortable with it of course
CR9Qen2TDgA,107600,109119,and uh
CR9Qen2TDgA,109119,110960,no i'm not gonna give her
CR9Qen2TDgA,110960,113600,you know whatever anyways okay
CR9Qen2TDgA,113600,115840,so two o'clock right now
CR9Qen2TDgA,115840,117600,um i think what i'll do is i'll go down
CR9Qen2TDgA,117600,119680,there right on time and maybe take a
CR9Qen2TDgA,119680,121600,look oh you either a just because
CR9Qen2TDgA,121600,123520,there's only one table guys
CR9Qen2TDgA,123520,125680,to start maybe four people like last
CR9Qen2TDgA,125680,127680,year i remember it or what it was
CR9Qen2TDgA,127680,129119,adam was just standing there waiting for
CR9Qen2TDgA,129119,130479,someone to play with him
CR9Qen2TDgA,130479,132000,like like a kid with a ball nobody will
CR9Qen2TDgA,132000,135200,play with me but this year um
CR9Qen2TDgA,135200,137920,i don't know we'll see
CR9Qen2TDgA,138640,139920,some of the field probably still in the
CR9Qen2TDgA,139920,142400,5k six max so i don't know but yeah so
CR9Qen2TDgA,142400,143840,the question is
CR9Qen2TDgA,143840,145440,when to start and if it's like
CR9Qen2TDgA,145440,147280,four-handed and they're all very very
CR9Qen2TDgA,147280,150160,good playing like 400 big blinds deep
CR9Qen2TDgA,150160,150959,um
CR9Qen2TDgA,150959,152640,it might be best to just wait till it's
CR9Qen2TDgA,152640,154160,a little softer
CR9Qen2TDgA,154160,157040,but i think we'll i really don't like
CR9Qen2TDgA,157040,158239,starting a tournament forehanded
CR9Qen2TDgA,158239,159680,five-handed i prefer just you know
CR9Qen2TDgA,159680,161280,starting early and
CR9Qen2TDgA,161280,163840,at a full full table and whatnot
CR9Qen2TDgA,163840,165599,so maybe what we'll do is we'll go down
CR9Qen2TDgA,165599,168640,there and look and see what's up okay
CR9Qen2TDgA,168640,171680,and in the meantime i want to try to fix
CR9Qen2TDgA,171680,173840,this thing right here yeah whatever's

CR9Qen2TDgA,236879,239200,like almost 400 big blinds

CR9Qen2TDgA,241920,243920,focus in so today's vlog what you can
CR9Qen2TDgA,243920,245040,expect
CR9Qen2TDgA,245040,246560,i'm guessing
CR9Qen2TDgA,246560,247360,is
CR9Qen2TDgA,247360,249439,it will be poker heavy
CR9Qen2TDgA,249439,252560,and hand breakdown heavy shenanigans
CR9Qen2TDgA,252560,255200,a little less of because
CR9Qen2TDgA,255200,257120,i've got to really focus hard
CR9Qen2TDgA,257120,258880,playing against tough cookies last year
CR9Qen2TDgA,258880,260479,in the same event
CR9Qen2TDgA,260479,262639,i had it i was there i was at the final
CR9Qen2TDgA,262639,264320,table and we lost the hammer basically
CR9Qen2TDgA,264320,266160,but that was a key pot i lost to adrian
CR9Qen2TDgA,266160,268560,matteos if you guys remember i had the
CR9Qen2TDgA,268560,271680,pocket aces he had the jack ten
CR9Qen2TDgA,271680,274320,came like jack nine deuce
CR9Qen2TDgA,274320,276960,turn was a deuce
CR9Qen2TDgA,276960,280000,whoever was a jack
CR9Qen2TDgA,280000,283120,i remember that once
CR9Qen2TDgA,283120,284800,that's last year this is this year this
CR9Qen2TDgA,284800,286720,year we run amazing right we don't lose
CR9Qen2TDgA,286720,288000,[ __ ] like that but this year
CR9Qen2TDgA,288000,289919,everything's going perfect
CR9Qen2TDgA,289919,291440,i'm gonna start off playing well the
CR9Qen2TDgA,291440,293680,question is like how to play right
CR9Qen2TDgA,293680,296880,because i have access to varying
CR9Qen2TDgA,296880,300000,like profiles really strategy profiles
CR9Qen2TDgA,300000,302639,like the one i used in the six max to
CR9Qen2TDgA,302639,304479,cash in that one it's a very different
CR9Qen2TDgA,304479,305680,profile from the one i'm going to be
CR9Qen2TDgA,305680,306960,doing here and i'm not going to get too
CR9Qen2TDgA,306960,308479,into detail into what that means but
CR9Qen2TDgA,308479,311120,generally speaking we're going horde
CR9Qen2TDgA,311120,313360,we're going to play you know if the
CR9Qen2TDgA,313360,315680,situation dictates that
CR9Qen2TDgA,315680,317840,we got to bluff off all our chips
CR9Qen2TDgA,317840,320080,our chips will be bluffed off okay we're
CR9Qen2TDgA,320080,322000,doing it we're not like waiting for a
CR9Qen2TDgA,322000,324240,better spot in 250k we're going to take
CR9Qen2TDgA,324240,326160,every spot every spot where they think
CR9Qen2TDgA,326160,327919,it's it's plus cv
CR9Qen2TDgA,327919,329919,we will have our chips
CR9Qen2TDgA,329919,333520,ready aim fire
CR9Qen2TDgA,333520,334400,l
CR9Qen2TDgA,334400,335759,f
CR9Qen2TDgA,335759,337039,g
CR9Qen2TDgA,337039,338560,all right it's decided we're gonna play
CR9Qen2TDgA,338560,340880,on time and you know why you know why
CR9Qen2TDgA,340880,342160,it's because

CR9Qen2TDgA,428160,429560,we got
CR9Qen2TDgA,429560,432880,1.534 so we made 34 000 in that level
CR9Qen2TDgA,432880,435039,got two hands we're going to talk about
CR9Qen2TDgA,435039,436560,in the steam room
CR9Qen2TDgA,436560,438080,that were
CR9Qen2TDgA,438080,439280,somewhat interesting the first one
CR9Qen2TDgA,439280,441680,especially let's go all right let's pull
CR9Qen2TDgA,441680,443440,up the hands here in the trusty phone
CR9Qen2TDgA,443440,445440,okay hand breakdown numero uno for the
CR9Qen2TDgA,445440,448000,250k blinds are two and four thousand of
CR9Qen2TDgA,448000,449680,course with a two with a four thousand
CR9Qen2TDgA,449680,451759,big blind annie okay
CR9Qen2TDgA,451759,453840,uh andrew robel in the hijack makes it
CR9Qen2TDgA,453840,456479,twelve thousand i'm in the cutoff
CR9Qen2TDgA,456479,459199,with two tens and i call the button is a
CR9Qen2TDgA,459199,461360,japanese player i don't know his name he
CR9Qen2TDgA,461360,463280,makes it forty three thousand
CR9Qen2TDgA,463280,465840,folds around to roble he calls
CR9Qen2TDgA,465840,466960,i call
CR9Qen2TDgA,466960,469840,flops nine seven seven rainbow
CR9Qen2TDgA,469840,472240,check i check the button that's seventy
CR9Qen2TDgA,472240,473440,five thousand
CR9Qen2TDgA,473440,475039,roble calls
CR9Qen2TDgA,475039,476960,at this point i feel like
CR9Qen2TDgA,476960,479039,i mean i could check raise sometimes but
CR9Qen2TDgA,479039,481759,i think just just a call right with my
CR9Qen2TDgA,481759,482800,tens
CR9Qen2TDgA,482800,484560,and the turn card is a nine so the board
CR9Qen2TDgA,484560,485840,is two pair
CR9Qen2TDgA,485840,489120,roble checks and i do block 910 suited
CR9Qen2TDgA,489120,491039,that's one hand that i block
CR9Qen2TDgA,491039,492879,uh one of the 910 suites there's one
CR9Qen2TDgA,492879,494400,left and there's also
CR9Qen2TDgA,494400,496639,you know two eight nine suiteds and
CR9Qen2TDgA,496639,497840,i don't know about eight eight suited
CR9Qen2TDgA,497840,499440,maybe but you know ace nine suited they
CR9Qen2TDgA,499440,500319,could be there someone could have a
CR9Qen2TDgA,500319,502080,seven whatever but i feel i feel like
CR9Qen2TDgA,502080,504400,i'm you know i could easily represent a
CR9Qen2TDgA,504400,507520,nine here or um
CR9Qen2TDgA,507520,509680,find out where you're at
CR9Qen2TDgA,509680,511599,for lack of a better term
CR9Qen2TDgA,511599,513599,i decided to take this opportunity to
CR9Qen2TDgA,513599,515680,lead for a hundred thousand on this turn
CR9Qen2TDgA,515680,518000,card and put the button in a sort of a
CR9Qen2TDgA,518000,520719,difficult spot with robo behind him
CR9Qen2TDgA,520719,523200,he folds and roble calls the 100k now
CR9Qen2TDgA,523200,526080,the reverse of four he checks and it's
CR9Qen2TDgA,526080,527920,problem hand it's problem situations
CR9Qen2TDgA,527920,529600,it's kind of a deep thinking thing so
CR9Qen2TDgA,529600,531839,what can robo have he could have a seven
CR9Qen2TDgA,531839,534480,he could have one of the 910 suiteds the
CR9Qen2TDgA,534480,536480,two eight nine suiteds i don't know
CR9Qen2TDgA,536480,539040,about ace eight suited i don't think so
CR9Qen2TDgA,539040,540640,but so there's those hands there's other
CR9Qen2TDgA,540640,541920,hands that you could have which is like
CR9Qen2TDgA,541920,544880,jacks or queens it didn't four bet maybe
CR9Qen2TDgA,544880,546880,some aces and kings but a little less
CR9Qen2TDgA,546880,549279,likely so it's a difficult thing where i
CR9Qen2TDgA,549279,551279,have two tens and now i don't really
CR9Qen2TDgA,551279,553920,beat anything anymore when he calls turn
CR9Qen2TDgA,553920,555839,i beat eights that's it so i don't have
CR9Qen2TDgA,555839,557360,a lot of showdown value so the question
CR9Qen2TDgA,557360,559760,is should i turn these tens into a bluff
CR9Qen2TDgA,559760,562480,uh it would cost probably about 400 000
CR9Qen2TDgA,562480,564800,to fire this blue river bluff uh and
CR9Qen2TDgA,564800,566959,what am i bluffing exactly right what am
CR9Qen2TDgA,566959,569120,i targeting i'm targeting jackson queens
CR9Qen2TDgA,569120,572880,six combos of that each it's 12
CR9Qen2TDgA,572880,574480,minus all the seven hands it's it's a
CR9Qen2TDgA,574480,576800,close situation but i think i should
CR9Qen2TDgA,576800,578480,probably bluff it with my tens because
CR9Qen2TDgA,578480,579839,i'm at the bottom of my range for the
CR9Qen2TDgA,579839,581600,most part i think if i had no pair i'd
CR9Qen2TDgA,581600,583200,probably bluff like if i had 10 8
CR9Qen2TDgA,583200,585440,something like that but i didn't bluff
CR9Qen2TDgA,585440,588240,any of two queens so we lost we took a
CR9Qen2TDgA,588240,590720,little hit there the next hand we're
CR9Qen2TDgA,590720,591920,going to talk about
CR9Qen2TDgA,591920,594399,2 500 5 000 are the blinds
CR9Qen2TDgA,594399,596080,in the hijack position jake similar
CR9Qen2TDgA,596080,598240,raises to 13 000.
CR9Qen2TDgA,598240,600080,i'm on the button and i pick up the king
CR9Qen2TDgA,600080,602240,five of clubs the previous hand this is
CR9Qen2TDgA,602240,603680,the only second hand he sat down he
CR9Qen2TDgA,603680,606320,raised with nine seven off so
CR9Qen2TDgA,606320,608480,that sort of like lets you know what his
CR9Qen2TDgA,608480,610160,plan is in that position i feel like
CR9Qen2TDgA,610160,612160,he's gonna be more frisky so right away
CR9Qen2TDgA,612160,614240,based on the very first hand he sat down
CR9Qen2TDgA,614240,616160,we already said okay i'm gonna be three
CR9Qen2TDgA,616160,617680,betting him in position every time he
CR9Qen2TDgA,617680,619519,raises the high check so i do so with
CR9Qen2TDgA,619519,621040,king five of clubs
CR9Qen2TDgA,621040,623120,my sizing was forty eight thousand so
CR9Qen2TDgA,623120,625440,almost 10x and i when i say 10x i'm
CR9Qen2TDgA,625440,627440,saying 10x the big point i make it 48
CR9Qen2TDgA,627440,628320,000.
CR9Qen2TDgA,628320,629600,he calls
CR9Qen2TDgA,629600,632399,flop is the 689 with two clubs so i've
CR9Qen2TDgA,632399,634079,got a decent flop here with the gut shot
CR9Qen2TDgA,634079,635600,flush draw
CR9Qen2TDgA,635600,637279,and the king over card he checks i bet
CR9Qen2TDgA,637279,639360,32 000.
CR9Qen2TDgA,639360,641040,he calls
CR9Qen2TDgA,641040,642959,turn is an 80 checks that's not a great
CR9Qen2TDgA,642959,645200,card for me i don't think especially in
CR9Qen2TDgA,645200,647519,this spot so i checked back
CR9Qen2TDgA,647519,650640,and the river is a 10. okay he checks
CR9Qen2TDgA,650640,652079,now on the river so the question is do
CR9Qen2TDgA,652079,653680,you give up on this one because you know
CR9Qen2TDgA,653680,656160,you don't necessarily want to have clubs
CR9Qen2TDgA,656160,656959,but
CR9Qen2TDgA,656959,659600,i feel like
CR9Qen2TDgA,659600,661440,a bed here just
CR9Qen2TDgA,661440,663200,seems pretty nutted from my perspective
CR9Qen2TDgA,663200,664800,and i could have a seven i could have
CR9Qen2TDgA,664800,666880,queen jack i could have pocket tens i
CR9Qen2TDgA,666880,669200,could have i'm representing enough hands
CR9Qen2TDgA,669200,671240,so i like to go for 125 into that
CR9Qen2TDgA,671240,674000,175-ish pot those lines were three five
CR9Qen2TDgA,674000,675839,so yeah i think it was 175 in the pot
CR9Qen2TDgA,675839,676640,ish
CR9Qen2TDgA,676640,678240,and he thinks for a second looks puzzled
CR9Qen2TDgA,678240,679839,and then folds to hand so that's been
CR9Qen2TDgA,679839,681680,our first two hours that's
CR9Qen2TDgA,681680,684240,unbelievably like good value tournament
CR9Qen2TDgA,684240,687279,you don't see that typically i mean 250k
CR9Qen2TDgA,687279,688800,that's a lot of money but anyway two
CR9Qen2TDgA,688800,690880,hand breakdowns in feel great
CR9Qen2TDgA,690880,691839,um
CR9Qen2TDgA,691839,693279,you know maybe a missed bluff against
CR9Qen2TDgA,693279,694640,roble but
CR9Qen2TDgA,694640,696399,whatever i mean
CR9Qen2TDgA,696399,698560,it's i don't know right it's like pretty
CR9Qen2TDgA,698560,700720,close i i feel like it would have been
CR9Qen2TDgA,700720,702160,disheartening to bet and have him call
CR9Qen2TDgA,702160,703519,and then just be like [ __ ] you have a
CR9Qen2TDgA,703519,706120,nine great
CR9Qen2TDgA,706120,715600,[Music]
CR9Qen2TDgA,715600,717760,okay end of level four one point eight
CR9Qen2TDgA,717760,720320,million and six thousand
CR9Qen2TDgA,720320,722240,good start we're gonna talk about a
CR9Qen2TDgA,722240,723680,couple more
CR9Qen2TDgA,723680,725519,and played a bunch of hens there we'll
CR9Qen2TDgA,725519,726720,talk about all them we'll talk about two
CR9Qen2TDgA,726720,728320,specifically all right there's already
CR9Qen2TDgA,728320,730320,41 players it's a very good tournament
CR9Qen2TDgA,730320,731519,very good tournament i got moved to this
CR9Qen2TDgA,731519,733760,table a while ago but i have a bad table
CR9Qen2TDgA,733760,736320,i have core i justin bonamo dan smith
CR9Qen2TDgA,736320,737920,dario
CR9Qen2TDgA,737920,741120,michael adamo and then one um
CR9Qen2TDgA,741120,743360,player i don't know so
CR9Qen2TDgA,743360,745360,okay so let's talk about first of all
CR9Qen2TDgA,745360,747440,the hand against the player i don't know
CR9Qen2TDgA,747440,748959,the blinds are three thousand six
CR9Qen2TDgA,748959,749920,thousand
CR9Qen2TDgA,749920,752160,six thousand big blind annie as always i
CR9Qen2TDgA,752160,753279,open the button with the queen of clubs
CR9Qen2TDgA,753279,756160,nine of spades to 15k
CR9Qen2TDgA,756160,759040,big blind he defends club's jack six
CR9Qen2TDgA,759040,760720,deuce rainbow
CR9Qen2TDgA,760720,762560,one heart on there
CR9Qen2TDgA,762560,765440,he checks that i continue for 24 000.
CR9Qen2TDgA,765440,766880,he calls
CR9Qen2TDgA,766880,768560,kern's the queen of hearts so i make
CR9Qen2TDgA,768560,770480,queens which is a nice card he checks i
CR9Qen2TDgA,770480,772079,bet pretty much part of it eighty-five
CR9Qen2TDgA,772079,773760,thousand wow
CR9Qen2TDgA,773760,775440,he called
CR9Qen2TDgA,775440,778160,river is an ace of diamonds and he just
CR9Qen2TDgA,778160,780639,leads for 125.
CR9Qen2TDgA,780639,782160,i don't know what the hell this hand is
CR9Qen2TDgA,782160,784240,but i'm gonna definitely see it i'm way
CR9Qen2TDgA,784240,787120,too up there high in my range i call and
CR9Qen2TDgA,787120,789440,he had jack five of hearts so he turned
CR9Qen2TDgA,789440,791440,jacks into a bluff there when the ace
CR9Qen2TDgA,791440,793279,came uh and we won that one he's been
CR9Qen2TDgA,793279,795680,bluffing a decent amount this guy
CR9Qen2TDgA,795680,797760,this next hand um
CR9Qen2TDgA,797760,799519,a little different this one's dario
CR9Qen2TDgA,799519,801200,sammartino raising under the gun at four
CR9Qen2TDgA,801200,803200,and eight thousand lines
CR9Qen2TDgA,803200,805760,um corey calls from the cutoff i defend
CR9Qen2TDgA,805760,806800,the big line with the queen deuce of
CR9Qen2TDgA,806800,808240,diamonds
CR9Qen2TDgA,808240,810240,flop is ace of diamonds five of diamonds
CR9Qen2TDgA,810240,813760,five of spades goes check check check
CR9Qen2TDgA,813760,815200,turn card is the three of spades
CR9Qen2TDgA,815200,817200,bringing back to our spades i like to go
CR9Qen2TDgA,817200,819920,40 000 pretty sizable bet close to
CR9Qen2TDgA,819920,821279,two-thirds pot
CR9Qen2TDgA,821279,823360,dario calls
CR9Qen2TDgA,823360,825839,corey folks in the river i had a nice
CR9Qen2TDgA,825839,827839,diamond the three of diamonds so i make
CR9Qen2TDgA,827839,829199,my flush but there's five five three
CR9Qen2TDgA,829199,830639,three on board
CR9Qen2TDgA,830639,832079,so i decide with this board and the
CR9Qen2TDgA,832079,834320,texture i want to get weak aces to call
CR9Qen2TDgA,834320,836800,and stuff like that and so i go ahead
CR9Qen2TDgA,836800,839680,and make a blocker bet of 40 000.
CR9Qen2TDgA,839680,843120,and dario raises me 245. so for him to
CR9Qen2TDgA,843120,844240,play the hand the way he did checking
CR9Qen2TDgA,844240,846000,flop calling turn and then
CR9Qen2TDgA,846000,847680,raising river i mean there's a lot of
CR9Qen2TDgA,847680,849360,hands first of all i think that i have
CR9Qen2TDgA,849360,850720,to have a minimum defense frequency
CR9Qen2TDgA,850720,852320,right so i think i can just call with
CR9Qen2TDgA,852320,854000,every time i have a five
CR9Qen2TDgA,854000,855920,right so five's full because i have a
CR9Qen2TDgA,855920,857680,five a decent amount you know and i
CR9Qen2TDgA,857680,859360,still take that line and i can probably
CR9Qen2TDgA,859360,861120,just fold everything else like my
CR9Qen2TDgA,861120,863279,flushes and whatnot so he's representing
CR9Qen2TDgA,863279,865760,you know ace five pocket aces and those
CR9Qen2TDgA,865760,867360,are both reasonable for him to have from
CR9Qen2TDgA,867360,869279,under the gun and as played it's
CR9Qen2TDgA,869279,870560,certainly credible
CR9Qen2TDgA,870560,872880,um the only thing i beat is if he just
CR9Qen2TDgA,872880,874160,like
CR9Qen2TDgA,874160,875600,called turned like some sort of flush
CR9Qen2TDgA,875600,877199,draw of spades
CR9Qen2TDgA,877199,878959,and then missed and decided to turn it
CR9Qen2TDgA,878959,881519,into a bluff i don't think so
CR9Qen2TDgA,881519,883360,so we folded that one i feel really good
CR9Qen2TDgA,883360,884320,i'm gonna
CR9Qen2TDgA,884320,885920,haven't even had my second coffee yet i
CR9Qen2TDgA,885920,888560,got tarantino's great vegan spot here in
CR9Qen2TDgA,888560,889360,town
CR9Qen2TDgA,889360,890720,on the way patty should be here any
CR9Qen2TDgA,890720,891680,minute
CR9Qen2TDgA,891680,894399,i'm gonna have me a fake chicken parm
CR9Qen2TDgA,894399,896399,and then a napoleon dessert something
CR9Qen2TDgA,896399,897360,yummy
CR9Qen2TDgA,897360,898880,um
CR9Qen2TDgA,898880,900079,and then we're gonna keep grinding so
CR9Qen2TDgA,900079,901360,four levels through and i feel great
CR9Qen2TDgA,901360,903279,we'll have a coffee on the next break
CR9Qen2TDgA,903279,904399,yeah that's how i'm doing it now a
CR9Qen2TDgA,904399,905519,little bit later since i've been going
CR9Qen2TDgA,905519,907920,to sleep so late okay so far so good
CR9Qen2TDgA,907920,910000,hauled he has the king and the queen we
CR9Qen2TDgA,910000,912160,can beat that obviously so now we need
CR9Qen2TDgA,912160,913600,to hold
CR9Qen2TDgA,913600,917120,just put an ace out there that'd be nice
CR9Qen2TDgA,921199,922639,real slow like
CR9Qen2TDgA,922639,924959,he felt it didn't he he just felt it
CR9Qen2TDgA,924959,927760,190. 190.
CR9Qen2TDgA,927760,930160,okay guys not an ideal two hours we're
CR9Qen2TDgA,930160,934079,gonna break here with uh 370 000
CR9Qen2TDgA,934079,936959,that'll be good for 26 bigs
CR9Qen2TDgA,936959,940079,um we're gonna talk about a big hand
CR9Qen2TDgA,940079,941440,yeah one big handle we'll just talk
CR9Qen2TDgA,941440,942880,about that one because
CR9Qen2TDgA,942880,944480,i don't know that one seems whatever i'm
CR9Qen2TDgA,944480,946079,going to tell you about all right guys
CR9Qen2TDgA,946079,947440,it's been a struggle been a struggle but
CR9Qen2TDgA,947440,948959,we we we're going to fight on actually i
CR9Qen2TDgA,948959,952160,have 347 so that's like 20
CR9Qen2TDgA,952160,954160,two bigs doubled as you saw uh
CR9Qen2TDgA,954160,955839,throughout them when i was really short
CR9Qen2TDgA,955839,958240,let's talk about this big hand where i
CR9Qen2TDgA,958240,961440,uh lost a lot of chips on a bluff
CR9Qen2TDgA,961440,963120,and it's a good bluff
CR9Qen2TDgA,963120,965600,so anyway
CR9Qen2TDgA,965600,967600,got five and ten thousand blinds corey
CR9Qen2TDgA,967600,969040,aldemere in the cutoff makes it twenty
CR9Qen2TDgA,969040,970800,three thousand it's gonna be a lot of
CR9Qen2TDgA,970800,973120,hands justin bonamaw on the button three
CR9Qen2TDgA,973120,974720,bets to 90 000.
CR9Qen2TDgA,974720,976399,that doesn't have to be aces that's you
CR9Qen2TDgA,976399,978639,know those are the stealing positions
CR9Qen2TDgA,978639,980160,we're in the big blind
CR9Qen2TDgA,980160,982240,sitting on a good stack we all have over
CR9Qen2TDgA,982240,984240,1.5 i think
CR9Qen2TDgA,984240,986800,uh i make a 240 from the big blind with
CR9Qen2TDgA,986800,988959,the ace of spades queen of diamonds so
CR9Qen2TDgA,988959,991040,it's a semi bluff hand right i mean the
CR9Qen2TDgA,991040,993279,hand has value on its own but obviously
CR9Qen2TDgA,993279,994880,we want everybody full
CR9Qen2TDgA,994880,997120,240 is the size we choose polarizing
CR9Qen2TDgA,997120,998480,size when you have
CR9Qen2TDgA,998480,1000320,four betting because you know you're
CR9Qen2TDgA,1000320,1001519,pretty polarized when you do that
CR9Qen2TDgA,1001519,1002560,generally
CR9Qen2TDgA,1002560,1004560,corey folds bottom of calls which i
CR9Qen2TDgA,1004560,1006639,expected him to do probably a decent
CR9Qen2TDgA,1006639,1007680,amount
CR9Qen2TDgA,1007680,1009279,so now the flop is actually i thought it
CR9Qen2TDgA,1009279,1011120,was a pretty good flop for me to be
CR9Qen2TDgA,1011120,1012000,honest
CR9Qen2TDgA,1012000,1013600,king of diamonds ten of diamonds seven
CR9Qen2TDgA,1013600,1014880,hearts and i have that queen of diamonds
CR9Qen2TDgA,1014880,1016160,so i block him having ace queen of
CR9Qen2TDgA,1016160,1018079,diamonds or clean jacket diamonds which
CR9Qen2TDgA,1018079,1019440,are two hands that you know he'd want to
CR9Qen2TDgA,1019440,1020880,get it in with here
CR9Qen2TDgA,1020880,1022800,so now of course we're gonna see bet
CR9Qen2TDgA,1022800,1025600,this flop and we bet 150 000 and he
CR9Qen2TDgA,1025600,1027199,calls so he's going to call here with a
CR9Qen2TDgA,1027199,1028240,10
CR9Qen2TDgA,1028240,1031918,some king x some straight draws jacks
CR9Qen2TDgA,1031918,1033678,nines
CR9Qen2TDgA,1033678,1035918,face jack like there's a lot of hands
CR9Qen2TDgA,1035918,1037360,he's going to call with right there's a
CR9Qen2TDgA,1037360,1039038,lot of ants he's going to call flop with
CR9Qen2TDgA,1039038,1041199,and full turn with especially to that
CR9Qen2TDgA,1041199,1043520,size the turn is the four of hearts
CR9Qen2TDgA,1043520,1046160,i have about 1.4
CR9Qen2TDgA,1046160,1047600,in chips
CR9Qen2TDgA,1047600,1051679,and i bluff at it for 500 000
CR9Qen2TDgA,1051679,1053200,he moves in
CR9Qen2TDgA,1053200,1055360,we fold obviously because we had nothing
CR9Qen2TDgA,1055360,1056640,and then from there we just lost a lot
CR9Qen2TDgA,1056640,1058640,of pots here and there and then i lost
CR9Qen2TDgA,1058640,1061120,one where i had um i had a 10 on 10 8
CR9Qen2TDgA,1061120,1063120,deuce and a raised call pot flop was
CR9Qen2TDgA,1063120,1064480,checked around
CR9Qen2TDgA,1064480,1065520,um
CR9Qen2TDgA,1065520,1067760,and then bono had two threes and he had
CR9Qen2TDgA,1067760,1069200,a three on the turn
CR9Qen2TDgA,1069200,1072080,so that cost us uh an extra
CR9Qen2TDgA,1072080,1075120,170 and 75 so
CR9Qen2TDgA,1075120,1077679,245 there all right so but i should have
CR9Qen2TDgA,1077679,1079120,folded that [ __ ] river i knew he had
CR9Qen2TDgA,1079120,1080640,it i just knew when the three head he
CR9Qen2TDgA,1080640,1083679,had threes i didn't fold out for 170.
CR9Qen2TDgA,1083679,1085760,okay so work to do
CR9Qen2TDgA,1085760,1088320,right we're gonna focus in
CR9Qen2TDgA,1088320,1089440,um
CR9Qen2TDgA,1089440,1090960,you know and it's a weird situation
CR9Qen2TDgA,1090960,1092000,right because like you start with so
CR9Qen2TDgA,1092000,1094000,many damn chips feels like we're so far
CR9Qen2TDgA,1094000,1095360,behind but in reality i mean we still
CR9Qen2TDgA,1095360,1096880,have over 20 big blinds you know how
CR9Qen2TDgA,1096880,1098640,we've played plenty of tournaments where
CR9Qen2TDgA,1098640,1100240,we'd love to have 20 big blinds and we
CR9Qen2TDgA,1100240,1101760,do we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna

CR9Qen2TDgA,1257520,1259039,both sitting on
CR9Qen2TDgA,1259039,1260080,over
CR9Qen2TDgA,1260080,1262720,1.5 me and uh my opponent
CR9Qen2TDgA,1262720,1264000,10 and 15.
CR9Qen2TDgA,1264000,1264960,heath
CR9Qen2TDgA,1264960,1266960,ben heath raises the button to 45 000.
CR9Qen2TDgA,1266960,1268240,that's 3x
CR9Qen2TDgA,1268240,1269679,we're in the big line and we pick up the
CR9Qen2TDgA,1269679,1271760,ace 10 off suit
CR9Qen2TDgA,1271760,1273600,i like to three bet this hand i
CR9Qen2TDgA,1273600,1275440,randomized this a little bit
CR9Qen2TDgA,1275440,1277280,you know based on situations and whatnot
CR9Qen2TDgA,1277280,1279600,i make it 215. this is a good size you
CR9Qen2TDgA,1279600,1281440,know you got to put heat on it when
CR9Qen2TDgA,1281440,1283039,people are deep you know you help your
CR9Qen2TDgA,1283039,1284559,race eyes a little bit
CR9Qen2TDgA,1284559,1286880,i make it 2 15 he calls as i expect he's
CR9Qen2TDgA,1286880,1288400,going to do a decent amount
CR9Qen2TDgA,1288400,1290720,loves king king eight
CR9Qen2TDgA,1290720,1291440,so
CR9Qen2TDgA,1291440,1293919,i mean i have the ace kings he doesn't
CR9Qen2TDgA,1293919,1295919,he still has king queens and king jacks
CR9Qen2TDgA,1295919,1298240,and all kinds of things like that but
CR9Qen2TDgA,1298240,1301679,he i have all the ace kings so i bet 125
CR9Qen2TDgA,1301679,1304240,i expect him to float a ton here so i'm
CR9Qen2TDgA,1304240,1307360,not throwing out this 125.
CR9Qen2TDgA,1307360,1310480,what now i bet the 125 he calls
CR9Qen2TDgA,1310480,1312640,turn is the jack of hearts and that
CR9Qen2TDgA,1312640,1315280,brings back door hearts so there's two
CR9Qen2TDgA,1315280,1316640,hearts on board now
CR9Qen2TDgA,1316640,1319120,it's up to me i have a gut shot now
CR9Qen2TDgA,1319120,1320799,i block some stuff
CR9Qen2TDgA,1320799,1322400,a jack is another potentially good
CR9Qen2TDgA,1322400,1325200,barrel card against like two sevens
CR9Qen2TDgA,1325200,1326720,something like that you know if against
CR9Qen2TDgA,1326720,1328559,sevens i have a ton of equity he also
CR9Qen2TDgA,1328559,1329919,has a very difficult call doesn't beat a
CR9Qen2TDgA,1329919,1331520,whole lot so he's going to fold that
CR9Qen2TDgA,1331520,1334799,hand a decent amount so i bet 375
CR9Qen2TDgA,1334799,1336400,and he folded quite quickly so we won
CR9Qen2TDgA,1336400,1337440,that one
CR9Qen2TDgA,1337440,1339039,okay that was a good one let's go to
CR9Qen2TDgA,1339039,1340480,this next one here this one is a little
CR9Qen2TDgA,1340480,1342320,frisky okay
CR9Qen2TDgA,1342320,1344799,this one was uh ideas all right so say
CR9Qen2TDgA,1344799,1347520,now the blinds are 10 and 20 000.
CR9Qen2TDgA,1347520,1349120,sam's overall raises in the cut off to
CR9Qen2TDgA,1349120,1352000,45 000. alex boxing calls in the small
CR9Qen2TDgA,1352000,1355280,blind we call with king seven
CR9Qen2TDgA,1355280,1358000,flop is queen seven deuce rainbow
CR9Qen2TDgA,1358000,1361200,check check [ __ ] sam betts 35 000 as he
CR9Qen2TDgA,1361200,1363440,will do a lot on this flop and foxton
CR9Qen2TDgA,1363440,1365520,calls bucks in on this dry board he's
CR9Qen2TDgA,1365520,1367360,going to call a lot wider than you think
CR9Qen2TDgA,1367360,1368480,i think he's calling with all of his
CR9Qen2TDgA,1368480,1369760,pocket pairs he's going to call with a
CR9Qen2TDgA,1369760,1370640,seven
CR9Qen2TDgA,1370640,1372799,he's calling to float some with 10 jack
CR9Qen2TDgA,1372799,1374480,suited king jack suited a whole bunch of
CR9Qen2TDgA,1374480,1375760,things he's going to potentially be
CR9Qen2TDgA,1375760,1377280,doing here right
CR9Qen2TDgA,1377280,1379600,um one thing for sure though is he
CR9Qen2TDgA,1379600,1381600,doesn't have queen seven or queen deuce
CR9Qen2TDgA,1381600,1382880,and he probably doesn't have pocket
CR9Qen2TDgA,1382880,1384159,seven since we have a seven there's only
CR9Qen2TDgA,1384159,1386880,one combo that so in terms of like
CR9Qen2TDgA,1386880,1389280,you know high end range obviously i
CR9Qen2TDgA,1389280,1390400,don't have three queens in my range but
CR9Qen2TDgA,1390400,1392240,i have pocket sevens i have pocket
CR9Qen2TDgA,1392240,1393520,deuces i have queen seven and queen
CR9Qen2TDgA,1393520,1395120,deuce more importantly like those are
CR9Qen2TDgA,1395120,1396720,hands that i'm going to have that
CR9Qen2TDgA,1396720,1399600,maybe sam could have not alex so anyway
CR9Qen2TDgA,1399600,1402240,he calls uh sambas to 35 alex calls the
CR9Qen2TDgA,1402240,1405120,35 i make it 160
CR9Qen2TDgA,1405120,1406000,okay
CR9Qen2TDgA,1406000,1408320,raising about half pot on the flop on a
CR9Qen2TDgA,1408320,1411360,dry board sam folds and fox and calls
CR9Qen2TDgA,1411360,1413919,okay so now i'm like thinking he has a
CR9Qen2TDgA,1413919,1414840,queen
CR9Qen2TDgA,1414840,1416480,right
CR9Qen2TDgA,1416480,1417360,so
CR9Qen2TDgA,1417360,1420159,turn card is a nine clubs backdoor clubs
CR9Qen2TDgA,1420159,1420960,there
CR9Qen2TDgA,1420960,1423039,he checks
CR9Qen2TDgA,1423039,1426080,i like to check with this hand
CR9Qen2TDgA,1426080,1427200,um
CR9Qen2TDgA,1427200,1429120,which i would actually oddly you know he
CR9Qen2TDgA,1429120,1430480,doesn't know this or maybe he will but
CR9Qen2TDgA,1430480,1431679,like i would check back sets there a
CR9Qen2TDgA,1431679,1434080,decent amount oddly on a really dry
CR9Qen2TDgA,1434080,1436640,board like that and go for like
CR9Qen2TDgA,1436640,1439279,big coyote river stuff
CR9Qen2TDgA,1439279,1440240,um
CR9Qen2TDgA,1440240,1441919,so i check back
CR9Qen2TDgA,1441919,1444159,and the river is a four an innocuous
CR9Qen2TDgA,1444159,1447039,card he bets 135 000. so when you think
CR9Qen2TDgA,1447039,1448799,about his range right what that can
CR9Qen2TDgA,1448799,1450559,withstand heat
CR9Qen2TDgA,1450559,1452000,it's a whole bunch of one pair hands
CR9Qen2TDgA,1452000,1453760,that he's got right
CR9Qen2TDgA,1453760,1456400,king queen queen jack whatever the only
CR9Qen2TDgA,1456400,1457600,hand
CR9Qen2TDgA,1457600,1459679,we have to be concerned about here
CR9Qen2TDgA,1459679,1461600,in terms of him calling a raise
CR9Qen2TDgA,1461600,1464799,is queen nine suited right that's it
CR9Qen2TDgA,1464799,1466960,that's it queen nine suited
CR9Qen2TDgA,1466960,1468159,so
CR9Qen2TDgA,1468159,1469840,there was only like two combos of that
CR9Qen2TDgA,1469840,1471120,because the queen and the nine were
CR9Qen2TDgA,1471120,1473440,different suits so there was just like
CR9Qen2TDgA,1473440,1475279,not a lot of hands he could have there i
CR9Qen2TDgA,1475279,1476720,mean of course he can have pocket deuces
CR9Qen2TDgA,1476720,1478240,and he could have the case pair of
CR9Qen2TDgA,1478240,1481440,sevens sure he bets 135 on the river
CR9Qen2TDgA,1481440,1484000,it's a very small blocker size right
CR9Qen2TDgA,1484000,1485440,so
CR9Qen2TDgA,1485440,1488240,as played i felt like i could still have
CR9Qen2TDgA,1488240,1489600,the three sevens i could still have
CR9Qen2TDgA,1489600,1491840,queen seven could have pocket deuces i
CR9Qen2TDgA,1491840,1493600,could have all these hands
CR9Qen2TDgA,1493600,1495039,and i don't have much air there's just
CR9Qen2TDgA,1495039,1496880,not a lot of like what i have is nothing
CR9Qen2TDgA,1496880,1497760,you know
CR9Qen2TDgA,1497760,1500159,um so i make it 635 and unfortunately he
CR9Qen2TDgA,1500159,1502240,gets the calls because he has the queen
CR9Qen2TDgA,1502240,1504400,nine suited dang it so we had queens and
CR9Qen2TDgA,1504400,1505440,nines and that brought us back to
CR9Qen2TDgA,1505440,1507200,starting stack but listen guys we're
CR9Qen2TDgA,1507200,1508320,playing the game
CR9Qen2TDgA,1508320,1509360,um
CR9Qen2TDgA,1509360,1510960,we got a positive attitude going in we
CR9Qen2TDgA,1510960,1513200,got two more hours to play like a champ
