wt6SwI84iQs,560,2800,the supreme court has ruled that maine
wt6SwI84iQs,2800,4560,violated the constitution when it
wt6SwI84iQs,4560,6399,refused to make public funding available
wt6SwI84iQs,6399,8000,for students to attend schools that
wt6SwI84iQs,8000,10000,provide religious instruction the
wt6SwI84iQs,10000,11920,opinion given by chief justice roberts
wt6SwI84iQs,11920,13519,provided a clear sentiment that when
wt6SwI84iQs,13519,15360,state and local governments choose to
wt6SwI84iQs,15360,17520,subsidize private schools that must
wt6SwI84iQs,17520,19600,allow families to use taxpayer funds to
wt6SwI84iQs,19600,21840,pay for religious schools justice sonia
wt6SwI84iQs,21840,24160,sotomayor came out against the ruling
wt6SwI84iQs,24160,25680,accusing conservatives on the court of
wt6SwI84iQs,25680,28080,attempting to end the separation between
wt6SwI84iQs,28080,30000,church and state she wrote in her
wt6SwI84iQs,30000,32238,dissent in just a few years the court
wt6SwI84iQs,32238,34559,has upended constitutional doctrine
wt6SwI84iQs,34559,36559,shifting from a rule that permits states
wt6SwI84iQs,36559,38239,to decline to fund religious
wt6SwI84iQs,38239,40399,organizations to one that requires
wt6SwI84iQs,40399,42239,states in many circumstances to
wt6SwI84iQs,42239,44480,subsidize religious indoctrination with
wt6SwI84iQs,44480,47360,taxpayer dollars twitter user law boy
wt6SwI84iQs,47360,49200,writes this case is even worse than it
wt6SwI84iQs,49200,51680,looks in response to desegregation
wt6SwI84iQs,51680,53440,conservatives began to build a network
wt6SwI84iQs,53440,55280,of private religious schools absorbing
wt6SwI84iQs,55280,57360,public funds but not subject to the
wt6SwI84iQs,57360,60079,rules governing public education this is
wt6SwI84iQs,60079,62160,part of that effort
wt6SwI84iQs,62160,63680,we're going to we're going to disagree
wt6SwI84iQs,63680,65360,massively on that so what's your issue
wt6SwI84iQs,65360,66880,here why do you not have the these
wt6SwI84iQs,66880,69520,establishment clause concerns
wt6SwI84iQs,69520,71760,no i think uh that
wt6SwI84iQs,71760,73520,it is perfectly
wt6SwI84iQs,73520,75280,fine to fund
wt6SwI84iQs,75280,77759,religious education that the education
wt6SwI84iQs,77759,79920,dollars as a matter of policy right the
wt6SwI84iQs,79920,81280,constitutional question but that's not
wt6SwI84iQs,81280,84560,what the the case says that the state
wt6SwI84iQs,84560,87520,actually is able to and has been funding
wt6SwI84iQs,87520,91119,uh religious uh education the rule was
wt6SwI84iQs,91119,92240,that uh
wt6SwI84iQs,92240,94400,maine was funding these schools but the
wt6SwI84iQs,94400,96000,and they may be affiliated with or even
wt6SwI84iQs,96000,97680,run by religious organizations but their
wt6SwI84iQs,97680,99280,actual curricula just had to align with
wt6SwI84iQs,99280,100720,state standards
wt6SwI84iQs,100720,103200,two families challenged that limitation
wt6SwI84iQs,103200,105119,and and before recently that claim would
wt6SwI84iQs,105119,106159,have been this is according to an
wt6SwI84iQs,106159,108000,article in slate would have been laughed
wt6SwI84iQs,108000,110079,out of court because only permitted
wt6SwI84iQs,110079,111600,states to subsidize religious schools
wt6SwI84iQs,111600,114320,beginning in 2002. now it's saying that
wt6SwI84iQs,114320,116640,if the state says it wants to have any
wt6SwI84iQs,116640,119040,standards this is for from a from a
wt6SwI84iQs,119040,121200,libertarian the state has now said that
wt6SwI84iQs,121200,123360,it wants to have standards about
wt6SwI84iQs,123360,125040,what kind of curriculum is happening in
wt6SwI84iQs,125040,127119,these religiously funded schools
wt6SwI84iQs,127119,128879,and that's what's what was that issue
wt6SwI84iQs,128879,130479,right you can't do that
wt6SwI84iQs,130479,131920,right so you don't think that the the
wt6SwI84iQs,131920,133280,federal government's sending federal
wt6SwI84iQs,133280,136400,dollars to kids to the parents
wt6SwI84iQs,136400,138720,yeah who parents who want to because
wt6SwI84iQs,138720,139920,they're in these rural parts of maine
wt6SwI84iQs,139920,141760,completely understandable have access to
wt6SwI84iQs,141760,142800,schools that aren't necessarily the
wt6SwI84iQs,142800,145360,public schools that don't provide
wt6SwI84iQs,145360,147440,sufficient support to their community
wt6SwI84iQs,147440,149040,should at least adhere to the same kind
wt6SwI84iQs,149040,151840,of federal standards that happen in that
wt6SwI84iQs,151840,153280,are problems they have to be accredited
wt6SwI84iQs,153280,155200,they have to be legitimate well the
wt6SwI84iQs,155200,156160,argument here is that they should have
wt6SwI84iQs,156160,158319,to give a secular education and not a
wt6SwI84iQs,158319,160319,purely religious education that that's
wt6SwI84iQs,160319,161360,the standard that the government
wt6SwI84iQs,161360,162879,shouldn't be paying for kids to get a
wt6SwI84iQs,162879,165440,religious education how is that i think
wt6SwI84iQs,165440,168160,for them to get whatever education their
wt6SwI84iQs,168160,170800,families the kids think is in their best
wt6SwI84iQs,170800,173599,interest well we are publicly funding
wt6SwI84iQs,173599,175040,education
wt6SwI84iQs,175040,177200,but we don't need to have education
wt6SwI84iQs,177200,180159,provided by the government we can let
wt6SwI84iQs,180159,181920,we can let a million flowers grow no
wt6SwI84iQs,181920,183599,it's funded by the government it's
wt6SwI84iQs,183599,185519,funded by it's funded by you and by your
wt6SwI84iQs,185519,189200,tax dollars robbie should the government
wt6SwI84iQs,189200,193280,fund a public school devoting devoted to
wt6SwI84iQs,193280,195599,drag performances
wt6SwI84iQs,195599,198319,and which educates kids exclusively on
wt6SwI84iQs,198319,201519,crt and uh hormone replacement therapy
wt6SwI84iQs,201519,203440,gender affirming therapy i think the
wt6SwI84iQs,203440,205760,family should get the money and can use
wt6SwI84iQs,205760,207200,that money toward their child's
wt6SwI84iQs,207200,209360,education for whatever education they
wt6SwI84iQs,209360,211519,think is best and if some liberal family
wt6SwI84iQs,211519,213440,thinks that education is the best and
wt6SwI84iQs,213440,214799,that school meets accreditation
wt6SwI84iQs,214799,216879,standards perfectly fine when the church
wt6SwI84iQs,216879,220560,of staten drag school opens in rural
wt6SwI84iQs,220560,222239,maine or whatever whatever you're
wt6SwI84iQs,222239,223599,monitoring liberals don't understand
wt6SwI84iQs,223599,224720,what we actually think your terms are
wt6SwI84iQs,224720,227360,acceptable yes absolutely no your terms
wt6SwI84iQs,227360,228239,robbie perhaps because you're a
wt6SwI84iQs,228239,229440,libertarian are willing to take this
wt6SwI84iQs,229440,231840,line but you know very well that this is
wt6SwI84iQs,231840,234640,a context dependent outcome and that the
wt6SwI84iQs,234640,236000,whole problem with these establishment
wt6SwI84iQs,236000,238560,law cases is that they have to pick and
wt6SwI84iQs,238560,240879,choose which religions and which beliefs
wt6SwI84iQs,240879,242560,are legitimate and which aren't that's
wt6SwI84iQs,242560,244000,exactly that's why that's why separating
wt6SwI84iQs,244000,245599,religion from all other kinds of belief
wt6SwI84iQs,245599,247040,doesn't make it that is exactly the
wt6SwI84iQs,247040,248799,scenario the founding fathers intended
wt6SwI84iQs,248799,250959,to avoid you should not be establishing
wt6SwI84iQs,250959,252720,one religion over the other and because
wt6SwI84iQs,252720,254319,you cannot get in this game they're not
wt6SwI84iQs,254319,256000,established this is not establishing one
wt6SwI84iQs,256000,257120,over the other saying if it's religion
wt6SwI84iQs,257120,258639,doesn't matter it's saying the state
wt6SwI84iQs,258639,262079,can't make a choice to to decide what
wt6SwI84iQs,262079,263759,kinds of institutions to set exact
wt6SwI84iQs,263759,265840,standards for what institutions get
wt6SwI84iQs,265840,268320,funded by federal tax dollars right and
wt6SwI84iQs,268320,269919,i think that in any other context people
wt6SwI84iQs,269919,271280,under would believe that there has to be
wt6SwI84iQs,271280,273759,some basic educational standard that's
wt6SwI84iQs,273759,275360,in place you wouldn't it has to be a
wt6SwI84iQs,275360,276720,basic educational scanner because it has
wt6SwI84iQs,276720,278400,to meet school accreditation but it does
wt6SwI84iQs,278400,280560,it can't not be it doesn't
wt6SwI84iQs,280560,282960,but what
wt6SwI84iQs,283919,285600,are no longer required to give a secular
wt6SwI84iQs,285600,287120,education that means the school can sit
wt6SwI84iQs,287120,289360,there and that's not the same dinosaurs
wt6SwI84iQs,289360,291600,who lived at the same time as man
wt6SwI84iQs,291600,294080,uh and that you know uh
wt6SwI84iQs,294080,296478,jesus
wt6SwI84iQs,304000,305919,spaghetti monster people the church of
wt6SwI84iQs,305919,308160,satan we this is what we believe and
wt6SwI84iQs,308160,309919,we're getting no fear
wt6SwI84iQs,309919,311120,we're going to give we're going to give
wt6SwI84iQs,311120,313520,instruction in this kind of thing and
wt6SwI84iQs,313520,315360,regardless if there's math or discipline
wt6SwI84iQs,315360,316400,you have conservatives all over the
wt6SwI84iQs,316400,318400,country upset because math is somehow
wt6SwI84iQs,318400,321199,being crt and math is racist and all of
wt6SwI84iQs,321199,322720,that fine i agree they're upset because
wt6SwI84iQs,322720,324960,there's no
wt6SwI84iQs,332880,334560,instead of having this intense culture
wt6SwI84iQs,334560,336479,war over what all schools are forced to
wt6SwI84iQs,336479,338400,teach we can de-escalate by saying you
wt6SwI84iQs,338400,340400,know what you and your family can choose
wt6SwI84iQs,340400,342000,the school that aligns with you and
wt6SwI84iQs,342000,343680,that's great and you and your family can
wt6SwI84iQs,343680,345280,do that we don't need to battle each
wt6SwI84iQs,345280,346880,other anymore we don't need to decide
wt6SwI84iQs,346880,347680,this
wt6SwI84iQs,347680,349440,as a libertarian that choice is fine but
wt6SwI84iQs,349440,351199,you cannot then say i'm a libertarian i
wt6SwI84iQs,351199,352479,want people independently to make their
wt6SwI84iQs,352479,353840,own kind of choices and go to whatever
wt6SwI84iQs,353840,355600,school they want and then say also
wt6SwI84iQs,355600,357440,though i'm going to co-ops federal tax
wt6SwI84iQs,357440,359840,dollars to support schools without any
wt6SwI84iQs,359840,361919,kind of basic secular educational
wt6SwI84iQs,361919,364080,standard explicitly by saying that they
wt6SwI84iQs,364080,366000,can promulgate a religious and
wt6SwI84iQs,366000,368160,exclusively religious without a secular
wt6SwI84iQs,368160,370479,standard for education they are saying
wt6SwI84iQs,370479,372720,tax dollars are establishing
wt6SwI84iQs,372720,374800,religious doctrine in an educational
wt6SwI84iQs,374800,377199,context i don't understand look i have
wt6SwI84iQs,377199,378240,no problems
wt6SwI84iQs,378240,380800,if maine wants maine here let's really
wt6SwI84iQs,380800,382400,really be clear about what's happening
wt6SwI84iQs,382400,385440,maine fully did and has been doing
wt6SwI84iQs,385440,387759,funding for religious institutions
wt6SwI84iQs,387759,389680,religious schools that's not the issue
wt6SwI84iQs,389680,392319,this isn't big bad liberals saying oh my
wt6SwI84iQs,392319,394160,gosh i don't want catholic schools or
wt6SwI84iQs,394160,396240,whatever to be funded the government has
wt6SwI84iQs,396240,398400,been doing that and maine has been doing
wt6SwI84iQs,398400,400240,that the question is whether or not they
wt6SwI84iQs,400240,402160,should have to provide a basic secular
wt6SwI84iQs,402160,404800,education standard if they are going to
wt6SwI84iQs,404800,406639,take federal funds
wt6SwI84iQs,406639,408000,i have a hard time understanding why
wt6SwI84iQs,408000,409520,that's objectionable
wt6SwI84iQs,409520,410560,you mean they
wt6SwI84iQs,410560,411520,if they're
wt6SwI84iQs,411520,414160,they can they should be able to take the
wt6SwI84iQs,414160,415520,fun
wt6SwI84iQs,415520,419360,it's our money it's letting the people
wt6SwI84iQs,419360,420639,take the money
wt6SwI84iQs,420639,421520,that
wt6SwI84iQs,421520,422880,comes from their taxes that the
wt6SwI84iQs,422880,424479,government confiscates to provide an
wt6SwI84iQs,424479,426639,education and saying they can use that
wt6SwI84iQs,426639,428720,to get the educational environment that
wt6SwI84iQs,428720,429919,best fits their needs and if that's a
wt6SwI84iQs,429919,431280,religious environment what do you mean
wt6SwI84iQs,431280,432800,like secular standards like they still
wt6SwI84iQs,432800,434319,teach they have to meet the
wt6SwI84iQs,434319,436240,accreditation standards to be a school
wt6SwI84iQs,436240,437840,you can't just like send you can't send
wt6SwI84iQs,437840,439440,your kids to a school that doesn't meet
wt6SwI84iQs,439440,441759,accreditation standards period i i don't
wt6SwI84iQs,441759,444160,know what that means all i know is that
wt6SwI84iQs,444160,446720,apparently these parents were so upset
wt6SwI84iQs,446720,448720,by like if you want to school your kids
wt6SwI84iQs,448720,450800,you have to meet certain requirements
wt6SwI84iQs,450800,454160,even the these parents were so upset the
wt6SwI84iQs,454160,455440,people who brought this case were so
wt6SwI84iQs,455440,457759,upset about whatever these basic secular
wt6SwI84iQs,457759,459919,education standards are that they took
wt6SwI84iQs,459919,461840,this case to the supreme court so that's
wt6SwI84iQs,461840,463919,what's at issue here there's no this is
wt6SwI84iQs,463919,466080,not and from a federalism perspective
wt6SwI84iQs,466080,467599,from a states rights perspective it is
wt6SwI84iQs,467599,469759,very curious to me that conservatives
wt6SwI84iQs,469759,473360,wouldn't question why you have a state
wt6SwI84iQs,473360,475120,a conservative state
wt6SwI84iQs,475120,477120,that has decided can't discriminate
wt6SwI84iQs,477120,478560,against religious belief no that's what
wt6SwI84iQs,478560,481440,they're saying before before 2002
wt6SwI84iQs,481440,482800,states weren't even permitted to fund
wt6SwI84iQs,482800,484479,religious institutions right now the
wt6SwI84iQs,484479,486160,pendulum has swung and said okay you can
wt6SwI84iQs,486160,488160,do it because i hope it keeps singing
wt6SwI84iQs,488160,489520,there's a basic acknowledgement that the
wt6SwI84iQs,489520,491199,public education system isn't
wt6SwI84iQs,491199,492960,sufficiently serving kids in this
wt6SwI84iQs,492960,495199,country fair enough i would argue that
wt6SwI84iQs,495199,497039,as for a host of reasons
wt6SwI84iQs,497039,499599,including as we mentioned in the in the
wt6SwI84iQs,499599,501599,read at the top that a lot of money was
wt6SwI84iQs,501599,503440,pulled out of the public edge education
wt6SwI84iQs,503440,505840,system during white flight when
wt6SwI84iQs,505840,507680,desegregation happened schools were
wt6SwI84iQs,507680,509199,integrated and so many white families
wt6SwI84iQs,509199,510720,decided that they were going to take
wt6SwI84iQs,510720,512240,their tax dollars and run rather than
wt6SwI84iQs,512240,514719,have their kids go to school with black
wt6SwI84iQs,514719,516479,kids i mean that's just the history of
wt6SwI84iQs,516479,519440,how we got this massive public private
wt6SwI84iQs,519440,520640,education system that didn't used to
wt6SwI84iQs,520640,522800,exist before americans used to realize
wt6SwI84iQs,522800,523760,that we
wt6SwI84iQs,523760,525040,really valued and we're very proud of
wt6SwI84iQs,525040,527600,our public education system before
wt6SwI84iQs,527600,529200,everyone was equally serviced by the
wt6SwI84iQs,529200,530880,public education system is meeting
wt6SwI84iQs,530880,533519,families needs they can they can go that
wt6SwI84iQs,533519,535519,route if it's not they should be able to
wt6SwI84iQs,535519,538000,where your zip code should not determine
wt6SwI84iQs,538000,539600,what school you have to go to you should
wt6SwI84iQs,539600,542160,just get that money and and do what's
wt6SwI84iQs,542160,543680,best for you and
wt6SwI84iQs,543680,545680,in consultation with your family so
wt6SwI84iQs,545680,548160,school again
wt6SwI84iQs,548160,550880,it is you know maine has been and you
wt6SwI84iQs,550880,553839,are allowed permitted to subsidize
wt6SwI84iQs,553839,555600,the state subsidizes religious
wt6SwI84iQs,555600,559360,institutions right but but this is a
wt6SwI84iQs,559360,562640,radical theory to a new extreme ordering
wt6SwI84iQs,562640,565120,no this case is about ordering mean
wt6SwI84iQs,565120,566959,not that mean has the choice to fund
wt6SwI84iQs,566959,569120,religious decisions this is a federalism
wt6SwI84iQs,569120,570959,issue should it should they're saying it
wt6SwI84iQs,570959,572880,violates its discriminatory against
wt6SwI84iQs,572880,575920,religion for them to not set aside funds
wt6SwI84iQs,575920,577920,for this kind so i i'm very interested
wt6SwI84iQs,577920,580080,that's what they say i personally am a
wt6SwI84iQs,580080,581519,subscriber to the church of the
wt6SwI84iQs,581519,583920,spaghetti monster so what if
wt6SwI84iQs,583920,586320,it said you can use this money on any
wt6SwI84iQs,586320,588480,school but not a muslim school
wt6SwI84iQs,588480,589920,now they can't because of the supreme
wt6SwI84iQs,589920,590959,court decision the supreme court
wt6SwI84iQs,590959,591839,decision saying no you can't
wt6SwI84iQs,591839,594080,discriminate against religious belief
wt6SwI84iQs,594080,595839,which i applaud
wt6SwI84iQs,595839,597279,you should actually be able to take the
wt6SwI84iQs,597279,599440,public money and get them uh
wt6SwI84iQs,599440,601120,as i'm reading this the issue is that if
wt6SwI84iQs,601120,603200,the muslim school has a secular
wt6SwI84iQs,603200,605120,education opportunity like many catholic
wt6SwI84iQs,605120,606320,schools do and like many of these
wt6SwI84iQs,606320,608079,schools do then it's not an issue you
wt6SwI84iQs,608079,610399,cannot describe it again you cannot with
wt6SwI84iQs,610399,612160,what do you mean a secular education
wt6SwI84iQs,612160,614399,opportunity
wt6SwI84iQs,614399,616560,if you go to a religious
wt6SwI84iQs,616560,618000,civic education to every child in the
wt6SwI84iQs,618000,619360,state the government created a tuition
wt6SwI84iQs,619360,620720,assistance program to help families who
wt6SwI84iQs,620720,622000,live in remote sparsely populated
wt6SwI84iQs,622000,623760,regions without any public schools under
wt6SwI84iQs,623760,625360,the program parents can send their kids
wt6SwI84iQs,625360,626880,to certain private schools and the state
wt6SwI84iQs,626880,628640,covers the cost of tuition right to
wt6SwI84iQs,628640,630399,qualify these schools much must give
wt6SwI84iQs,630399,632480,students a secular education they may be
wt6SwI84iQs,632480,633760,affiliated with or even run by a
wt6SwI84iQs,633760,635680,religious organization but their actual
wt6SwI84iQs,635680,637120,curriculum must ally with secular
wt6SwI84iQs,637120,638800,statements they all get a secular
wt6SwI84iQs,638800,640959,education i mean that math does not have
wt6SwI84iQs,640959,642480,a relationship
wt6SwI84iQs,642480,644480,right evidently not and that's and
wt6SwI84iQs,644480,646000,that's what's at issue here so you
wt6SwI84iQs,646000,647360,cannot discriminate against a school
wt6SwI84iQs,647360,648640,because it's a christian school or a
wt6SwI84iQs,648640,651360,muslim school or a jewish school but
wt6SwI84iQs,651360,653040,you can't discriminate against them
wt6SwI84iQs,653040,654880,based on they're not rising to the basic
wt6SwI84iQs,654880,656320,curriculum responses i think you
wt6SwI84iQs,656320,657360,shouldn't be able to do that and the
wt6SwI84iQs,657360,658959,supreme court agrees with me so it's
wt6SwI84iQs,658959,661440,there was a muslim school uh associate
wt6SwI84iQs,661440,663920,group advocacy group that was part of
wt6SwI84iQs,663920,666640,the people filing suit here because they
wt6SwI84iQs,666640,668720,wanted i don't i mean my grandfather was
wt6SwI84iQs,668720,670320,muslim i'm certainly not this isn't
wt6SwI84iQs,670320,672399,about me picking and choosing religions
wt6SwI84iQs,672399,674320,my whole point is that the state
wt6SwI84iQs,674320,675680,shouldn't be in the business of having
wt6SwI84iQs,675680,677920,to decide one day that is a one doesn't
wt6SwI84iQs,677920,680480,want to fund the spaghetti monsters pole
wt6SwI84iQs,680480,683040,dancing class for kids which i know that
wt6SwI84iQs,683040,684640,many conservatives and many liberals
wt6SwI84iQs,684640,685839,would have an issue i don't have this
wt6SwI84iQs,685839,688240,battle anymore that's fine yeah that you
wt6SwI84iQs,688240,689600,you do you
wt6SwI84iQs,689600,691760,your family do you and that should be
wt6SwI84iQs,691760,692800,the way it goes and we don't have to
wt6SwI84iQs,692800,694160,have these intense
wt6SwI84iQs,694160,696720,wars over it at the atomic
wt6SwI84iQs,696720,699920,national level if we can just let people
wt6SwI84iQs,699920,703279,be different it's fine
wt6SwI84iQs,703279,705120,and i think the constitution and the
wt6SwI84iQs,705120,706640,founding fathers oh now we're gonna oh
wt6SwI84iQs,706640,708720,now who's the strict constitutionalist
wt6SwI84iQs,708720,710320,did you just say constitution just gets
wt6SwI84iQs,710320,711760,in our way of doing whatever we should
wt6SwI84iQs,711760,713200,policy we think should be best well i
wt6SwI84iQs,713200,714800,think that you can let's do it
wt6SwI84iQs,714800,716480,you should look at what society is and
wt6SwI84iQs,716480,718160,what what core values you have as a
wt6SwI84iQs,718160,719440,community and i think one of our core
wt6SwI84iQs,719440,720959,values is the community is that the
wt6SwI84iQs,720959,722160,government should not be in the business
wt6SwI84iQs,722160,724160,of deciding which religions are real and
wt6SwI84iQs,724160,726160,which aren't which is obviously what
wt6SwI84iQs,726160,727600,always has to happen when you're talking
wt6SwI84iQs,727600,729680,about
wt6SwI84iQs,729680,731200,there's no difference between religious
wt6SwI84iQs,731200,732320,practice or any other what you're
wt6SwI84iQs,732320,733519,talking about so you just have to as
wt6SwI84iQs,733519,734880,long as it's a school when you're
wt6SwI84iQs,734880,736320,talking about tax breaks or religious
wt6SwI84iQs,736320,738320,institutions or any other context where
wt6SwI84iQs,738320,741120,the government is deciding who qualifies
wt6SwI84iQs,741120,742800,for financial benefit on the basis of
wt6SwI84iQs,742800,745279,being a religion but
wt6SwI84iQs,745279,746480,all right well i knew we were going to
wt6SwI84iQs,746480,748240,disagree on this one so it's it's nice
wt6SwI84iQs,748240,749279,to get a
wt6SwI84iQs,749279,751920,real debate on it so tomorrow on rising
wt6SwI84iQs,751920,753279,maybe we'll talk about this more i think
wt6SwI84iQs,753279,754880,we could have gone on for a while but
wt6SwI84iQs,754880,757040,also steven semler will join us to break
wt6SwI84iQs,757040,759120,down a new bill that could drain as much
wt6SwI84iQs,759120,760720,as 100 billion dollars from the
wt6SwI84iQs,760720,762880,department of defense's budget
