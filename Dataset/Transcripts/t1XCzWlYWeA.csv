t1XCzWlYWeA,240,3120,i'm available 24 7 just to help solve
t1XCzWlYWeA,3120,3600,issues
t1XCzWlYWeA,3600,5520,right don't call me 3am in a sunday
t1XCzWlYWeA,5520,6799,morning i don't care
t1XCzWlYWeA,6799,9920,a cross-pollination of thomas edison
t1XCzWlYWeA,9920,12639,and tony stark elon musk were you a
t1XCzWlYWeA,12639,14480,little naive when you thought i'll just
t1XCzWlYWeA,14480,16560,i can easily build build an electric car
t1XCzWlYWeA,16560,18160,and a rocket
t1XCzWlYWeA,18160,21520,i didn't think it would be easy um
t1XCzWlYWeA,21520,22800,i like i said i thought they would
t1XCzWlYWeA,22800,25519,probably fail um
t1XCzWlYWeA,25519,27680,but you know like creating a company is
t1XCzWlYWeA,27680,29039,almost like having a child
t1XCzWlYWeA,29039,31679,so it's sort of like how do you say your
t1XCzWlYWeA,31679,34719,child should not have food
t1XCzWlYWeA,35520,37280,so one once you have the company you
t1XCzWlYWeA,37280,39840,have to feed it and nurse it
t1XCzWlYWeA,39840,43360,and take care of it even if
t1XCzWlYWeA,43360,46480,it ruins you yeah
t1XCzWlYWeA,49920,52239,but supposing there wasn't tough times
t1XCzWlYWeA,52239,54360,in
t1XCzWlYWeA,54360,58559,2008 end of 2008
t1XCzWlYWeA,58559,60559,how did you get through that period of
t1XCzWlYWeA,60559,62878,crisis
t1XCzWlYWeA,65360,68560,can we just break for a second
t1XCzWlYWeA,69040,73840,you want to wait a little while
t1XCzWlYWeA,74479,77600,yeah sure if it was worth it let me
t1XCzWlYWeA,77600,79040,sure hope it was worth it it's
t1XCzWlYWeA,79040,81040,everything and um i
t1XCzWlYWeA,81040,82799,was borrowing money from fans to pay the
t1XCzWlYWeA,82799,84080,rent
t1XCzWlYWeA,84080,85759,well i mean tesla really faced the
t1XCzWlYWeA,85759,88320,severe uh threat threat of death
t1XCzWlYWeA,88320,91520,uh due to the model 3 production ramp
t1XCzWlYWeA,91520,93200,essentially the company was bleeding
t1XCzWlYWeA,93200,94799,money like crazy and and
t1XCzWlYWeA,94799,96960,just if if we didn't solve these
t1XCzWlYWeA,96960,98640,problems in a very short period of time
t1XCzWlYWeA,98640,100560,uh we would die uh and was extremely
t1XCzWlYWeA,100560,101759,difficult
t1XCzWlYWeA,101759,103759,to solve them how close to death did you
t1XCzWlYWeA,103759,106479,come we had within
t1XCzWlYWeA,106479,109040,a single digit weeks 22 hours a day or
t1XCzWlYWeA,109040,110000,like what how many hours
t1XCzWlYWeA,110000,112159,yeah seven days a week sleeping in the
t1XCzWlYWeA,112159,113360,factory
t1XCzWlYWeA,113360,114799,uh i worked everywhere from i worked in
t1XCzWlYWeA,114799,117040,the paint shop general assembly
t1XCzWlYWeA,117040,119119,body shop you ever worry about yourself
t1XCzWlYWeA,119119,120159,imploding like it's just
t1XCzWlYWeA,120159,124320,too much absolutely no one should
t1XCzWlYWeA,124320,128080,put this many hours into work
t1XCzWlYWeA,128080,131280,this is not good people should not work
t1XCzWlYWeA,131280,132560,this hard i'm not
t1XCzWlYWeA,132560,134480,they should not do this this is very
t1XCzWlYWeA,134480,135920,painful
t1XCzWlYWeA,135920,138480,painful in one sense it's because my
t1XCzWlYWeA,138480,140000,ears my brain
t1XCzWlYWeA,140000,141599,and my heart where do you come up with
t1XCzWlYWeA,141599,143040,your best ideas are you on vacation are
t1XCzWlYWeA,143040,144080,you kind of just like in the middle of
t1XCzWlYWeA,144080,145280,the night you wake up and start
t1XCzWlYWeA,145280,147840,drawing things down or oh you know this
t1XCzWlYWeA,147840,149840,sounds really cliche but um
t1XCzWlYWeA,149840,152080,like the shower is probably like you
t1XCzWlYWeA,152080,153519,know wake up and go to shower in the
t1XCzWlYWeA,153519,154560,morning and i think actually what's
t1XCzWlYWeA,154560,155680,really happened is kind of stuff is
t1XCzWlYWeA,155680,157519,percolated in the subconscious right
t1XCzWlYWeA,157519,158800,and it's not really occurring in the
t1XCzWlYWeA,158800,160000,shower but you're kind of getting the
t1XCzWlYWeA,160000,161840,results of last night's
t1XCzWlYWeA,161840,163840,you know computation basically right
t1XCzWlYWeA,163840,166000,whatever area that you get into
t1XCzWlYWeA,166000,168319,um given that you know even if you're if
t1XCzWlYWeA,168319,169040,you're
t1XCzWlYWeA,169040,170160,the best the best there's always a
t1XCzWlYWeA,170160,171920,chance of failure so i think it's
t1XCzWlYWeA,171920,173280,important that you really like whatever
t1XCzWlYWeA,173280,174319,you're doing
t1XCzWlYWeA,174319,176800,if you don't like it life is too short
t1XCzWlYWeA,176800,178000,um
t1XCzWlYWeA,178000,181120,you know i'd say if and also if you
t1XCzWlYWeA,181120,182640,if you like what you're doing you think
t1XCzWlYWeA,182640,184560,about it even when you're not working
t1XCzWlYWeA,184560,186879,i mean it'll just it's something that
t1XCzWlYWeA,186879,188879,your mind is drawn to
t1XCzWlYWeA,188879,191200,and and if you don't like it you just
t1XCzWlYWeA,191200,192640,really can't make it work i think
t1XCzWlYWeA,192640,196720,when you had that third failure in a row
t1XCzWlYWeA,196720,199519,did you think i need to pack this in
t1XCzWlYWeA,199519,201360,never
t1XCzWlYWeA,201360,204640,why not i don't ever give up
t1XCzWlYWeA,204640,207840,i mean i'd have to be dead or completely
t1XCzWlYWeA,207840,208959,incapacitated
t1XCzWlYWeA,208959,211440,starting a business i'd say number one
t1XCzWlYWeA,211440,213760,is have a high pain threshold
t1XCzWlYWeA,213760,216480,but that's um there's a friend of mine
t1XCzWlYWeA,216480,218080,who's got a good saying which is that
t1XCzWlYWeA,218080,219760,starting a company is like eating glass
t1XCzWlYWeA,219760,221360,and stirring into the abyss
t1XCzWlYWeA,221360,223920,okay that's um that's generally what
t1XCzWlYWeA,223920,224840,happens
t1XCzWlYWeA,224840,227599,because when you first start a company
t1XCzWlYWeA,227599,228879,there's lots of optimism
t1XCzWlYWeA,228879,230159,and things that things are great and
t1XCzWlYWeA,230159,233040,then so happiness at first is high
t1XCzWlYWeA,233040,235760,then you encounter all sorts of issues
t1XCzWlYWeA,235760,238080,and happiness will steadily decline
t1XCzWlYWeA,238080,239439,and then you'll go through a whole world
t1XCzWlYWeA,239439,241840,of hurt
t1XCzWlYWeA,242000,244239,and then eventually you'll if you
t1XCzWlYWeA,244239,245280,succeed and
t1XCzWlYWeA,245280,248959,in most cases you will not succeed um
t1XCzWlYWeA,248959,251439,and tesla almost didn't succeed came
t1XCzWlYWeA,251439,253840,very close to failure um
t1XCzWlYWeA,253840,256479,then if you succeed then after a long
t1XCzWlYWeA,256479,256880,time
t1XCzWlYWeA,256880,260320,you will finally get back to happiness
t1XCzWlYWeA,260320,264240,i think two is you gotta make sure that
t1XCzWlYWeA,264240,266479,that you that whatever you're doing is a
t1XCzWlYWeA,266479,268160,great product or service
t1XCzWlYWeA,268160,269919,it has to be really great and i go back
t1XCzWlYWeA,269919,272400,to what i was saying earlier where
t1XCzWlYWeA,272400,275600,um if you're a new company i mean unless
t1XCzWlYWeA,275600,277919,it's like some new industry or new
t1XCzWlYWeA,277919,279120,market that
t1XCzWlYWeA,279120,282320,if it's an untapped market or then then
t1XCzWlYWeA,282320,286320,uh you have more ability to
t1XCzWlYWeA,286320,289360,you there's this the standard is lower
t1XCzWlYWeA,289360,290800,for your product service but if you're
t1XCzWlYWeA,290800,292720,entering anything where there's
t1XCzWlYWeA,292720,295120,an existing marketplace against large
t1XCzWlYWeA,295120,296960,entrenched competitors
t1XCzWlYWeA,296960,299360,then your product or service needs to be
t1XCzWlYWeA,299360,300160,much better
t1XCzWlYWeA,300160,301520,than theirs it can't be a little bit
t1XCzWlYWeA,301520,302960,better because then you put yourself in
t1XCzWlYWeA,302960,304800,the shoes of the consumer
t1XCzWlYWeA,304800,306320,and they say why would you buy it as a
t1XCzWlYWeA,306320,307680,consumer you're always going to buy the
t1XCzWlYWeA,307680,309360,trusted brand unless there's a big
t1XCzWlYWeA,309360,310560,difference
t1XCzWlYWeA,310560,314160,so a lot of times uh you know
t1XCzWlYWeA,314160,316000,entrepreneur will come up with something
t1XCzWlYWeA,316000,318320,which is only slightly better
t1XCzWlYWeA,318320,320240,and it's it's not can't just be slightly
t1XCzWlYWeA,320240,323280,better it's got to be a lot better
t1XCzWlYWeA,323280,325520,uh number three i'd say is constantly
t1XCzWlYWeA,325520,326600,seek criticism
t1XCzWlYWeA,326600,328560,[Music]
t1XCzWlYWeA,328560,330940,uh a
t1XCzWlYWeA,330940,332960,[Music]
t1XCzWlYWeA,332960,336000,a wealth a well thought out critique of
t1XCzWlYWeA,336000,336960,whatever you're doing
t1XCzWlYWeA,336960,340400,is as valuable as gold
t1XCzWlYWeA,340639,342160,and you should seek that from
t1XCzWlYWeA,342160,343840,[Music]
t1XCzWlYWeA,343840,345520,everyone you can but particularly your
t1XCzWlYWeA,345520,347759,friends
t1XCzWlYWeA,347759,351039,usually your friends know what's wrong
t1XCzWlYWeA,351039,352400,but they don't want to tell you because
t1XCzWlYWeA,352400,354320,they don't want to hurt you
t1XCzWlYWeA,354320,357759,um so i left you up
t1XCzWlYWeA,357759,358960,yeah yeah so they're you know they'll
t1XCzWlYWeA,358960,361039,say oh i wouldn't encourage my friends
t1XCzWlYWeA,361039,361680,so
t1XCzWlYWeA,361680,362800,i'm not going to tell him what i think
t1XCzWlYWeA,362800,364400,is wrong with this product yeah it
t1XCzWlYWeA,364400,366240,doesn't mean your friends are right
t1XCzWlYWeA,366240,369600,but very often they are right and you at
t1XCzWlYWeA,369600,371039,least want to listen very carefully to
t1XCzWlYWeA,371039,371919,what they say
t1XCzWlYWeA,371919,375360,and to everyone if you're looking for
t1XCzWlYWeA,375360,377840,basically
t1XCzWlYWeA,378560,380040,you should take the approach that
t1XCzWlYWeA,380040,381759,[Music]
t1XCzWlYWeA,381759,385440,that you're wrong um you know that
t1XCzWlYWeA,385440,387919,that you the entrepreneur are wrong your
t1XCzWlYWeA,387919,388880,goal is to be
t1XCzWlYWeA,388880,393039,less wrong
