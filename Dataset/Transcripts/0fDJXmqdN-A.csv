0fDJXmqdN-A,3154,5092,Tuning out of starlight
0fDJXmqdN-A,5092,7660,The innocent lifetime flickers and flashes
0fDJXmqdN-A,7660,9134,Onto a canvas
0fDJXmqdN-A,9134,12540,"No, nobody seems worth it"
0fDJXmqdN-A,12540,14919,And while the feeling's sophisticated
0fDJXmqdN-A,14919,17394,The view is so restrained
0fDJXmqdN-A,17394,22004,The past is nearing closer and closer I fear  
0fDJXmqdN-A,22153,24358,So let's just cut the bullshit
0fDJXmqdN-A,24474,27419,And tell me who's independent
0fDJXmqdN-A,27866,32115,Thumbs twiddling and your life's escaping your mind
0fDJXmqdN-A,32331,34457,Keep in mind
0fDJXmqdN-A,35053,37388,Well the air ain't free as it used to be
0fDJXmqdN-A,37388,40268,But that's quite alright when you're still eighteen
0fDJXmqdN-A,40268,43368,It seems to be
0fDJXmqdN-A,43368,46864,And I'll tell you who's overrated
0fDJXmqdN-A,46864,50379,What's a beautiful person with some hideous dreams?
0fDJXmqdN-A,52774,56037,And while the lining isn't silver
0fDJXmqdN-A,56862,60512,We're verging on the side of the road that'll take us home  
0fDJXmqdN-A,62447,65637,The edge of us is getting weighed
0fDJXmqdN-A,66156,70202,Read about your life in your local papers
0fDJXmqdN-A,70271,74569,Realize the end of us is getting near
0fDJXmqdN-A,75245,78257,You're just a droplet of paint trickled off your canvas
0fDJXmqdN-A,78257,80933,Delirious illusions flowing backwards through the river of color 
0fDJXmqdN-A,80933,83097,While we analyze it to try see it clearer
0fDJXmqdN-A,83097,85829,Secretly appealing to a lonely prisoner
0fDJXmqdN-A,86195,87649,Now what's your vision?
0fDJXmqdN-A,87649,90308,"Initiate your shading, blend the universe together in time"
0fDJXmqdN-A,90308,92471,It only gets a little easier 
0fDJXmqdN-A,92471,95081,Suddenly piece yourself back together now
0fDJXmqdN-A,95892,97394,What's your vision?
0fDJXmqdN-A,175013,180766,And I don't wanna have to give a damn about you
0fDJXmqdN-A,181050,183295,Or your inhibitions
0fDJXmqdN-A,184539,188631,"After all, you're the one who taught me love"
0fDJXmqdN-A,189727,192784,Was not for everybody
0fDJXmqdN-A,193933,199420,"However, I'm starting to see this world in the right light"
0fDJXmqdN-A,199880,202046,Yet it still gets darker
0fDJXmqdN-A,203535,207497,"You see, it's just a simple symphony"
0fDJXmqdN-A,208200,210116,Or a painting
0fDJXmqdN-A,210400,211887,Whatever
0fDJXmqdN-A,212685,214827,This unnatural path
0fDJXmqdN-A,214827,217692,It spans infinitely
0fDJXmqdN-A,218883,221885,But my world is crumbling
0fDJXmqdN-A,222277,226515,Let it collapse into the abyss
0fDJXmqdN-A,227705,231000,In the midst of summer it won't exist
0fDJXmqdN-A,231757,234000,This emptiness
0fDJXmqdN-A,234149,236529,It's just a blank slate
0fDJXmqdN-A,237000,240368,Waiting for a painter to interfere
0fDJXmqdN-A,241126,243156,It's quite complex
0fDJXmqdN-A,243643,246281,But what do I know?
