iuL1NTNGMA8,140,3540,- We're slidin' into another Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade.
iuL1NTNGMA8,3540,5400,"This time around it's Hoffman,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,5400,7344,one of our editors who also does
iuL1NTNGMA8,7344,8769,"(camera shutters) all the shoots for me,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,8770,10960,for LTTStore.com.
iuL1NTNGMA8,10960,12420,"Oh yeah, work it, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,12420,14380,"- Yep, you look great. - He has me work it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,14380,15366,Thank you very much.
iuL1NTNGMA8,15366,18180,"(claps) Today, we're gonna be blowing the budget apparently,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,18180,21970,"because he's got an OLED TV, he's got an RTX 3080,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,21970,24289,"he's got a Core i9 CPU,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,24290,27140,"and there's no way this fit within the $5,000 limit,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,27140,28449,but-- - There's one more thing.
iuL1NTNGMA8,28450,29850,- Yes. - Two systems.
iuL1NTNGMA8,29850,32240,"- Two systems? - Behind you, right there."
iuL1NTNGMA8,32240,33610,"- Oh, my gosh. - It's a NAS."
iuL1NTNGMA8,33610,35550,- [Linus] How on earth are we gonna do all of this?
iuL1NTNGMA8,35550,38600,"- Oh, you also need these, since you're here."
iuL1NTNGMA8,38600,40177,"Please. - Oh, sorry."
iuL1NTNGMA8,40177,43059,I'm not supposed to be sliding on the floor.
iuL1NTNGMA8,43060,43893,Sorry.
iuL1NTNGMA8,51037,53620,(upbeat music)
iuL1NTNGMA8,59941,62280,(loud whooshing)
iuL1NTNGMA8,62280,64909,"Not gonna lie, this looks extremely ambitious."
iuL1NTNGMA8,64910,67560,"You have a full PC build, new TV,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,67560,69520,and what are we doing with this?
iuL1NTNGMA8,69520,71289,It's a NAS. - Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,71290,72560,- I wanna store-- - I love it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,72560,73420,"- Oh, yeah."
iuL1NTNGMA8,73420,74979,"- So, basically, I'm giving you"
iuL1NTNGMA8,74980,78300,the work station that you need to leave me
iuL1NTNGMA8,78300,79900,and go back to independent work.
iuL1NTNGMA8,80920,81869,"- Oh, how did--"
iuL1NTNGMA8,81870,83330,"You're kinda too smart, actually."
iuL1NTNGMA8,83330,86045,(Linus and Hoffman laugh)
iuL1NTNGMA8,86045,86878,- You dick!
iuL1NTNGMA8,86878,88090,What are we doin' first?
iuL1NTNGMA8,88090,89609,"- PC first, I guess."
iuL1NTNGMA8,89610,91720,"- Okay, PC first, ask questions later."
iuL1NTNGMA8,91720,92553,Bang!
iuL1NTNGMA8,92553,93386,- Yeah!
iuL1NTNGMA8,93386,94730,- [Linus] Why'd you choose
iuL1NTNGMA8,94730,97440,this particular motherboard CPU combo?
iuL1NTNGMA8,97440,99460,"- It's, well, the motherboard's cheap,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,99460,100640,and the CPU's a i9!
iuL1NTNGMA8,100640,104333,"I mean, what's cooler than us saying I have an i9?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,105291,108330,- (sniffs) Don't you love the smell of new electronics?
iuL1NTNGMA8,108330,110074,That manufacturing stank.
iuL1NTNGMA8,110074,111390,(sniffs) Oh!
iuL1NTNGMA8,111390,114440,"Oh, my God, can I play with this first?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,114440,115700,"- [Hoffman] Oh, the Camaro!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,115700,116729,- Does it have battery--
iuL1NTNGMA8,116730,117960,"Oh no, it's on now."
iuL1NTNGMA8,117960,119400,"There's no way it's gonna-- - Oh, it's--"
iuL1NTNGMA8,119400,120870,- I need a USB charger.
iuL1NTNGMA8,120870,123120,"God, this thing looks ugly, doesn't it?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,123120,125290,"Oh, my God, I need a money cat."
iuL1NTNGMA8,125290,127440,It's a solar money cat!
iuL1NTNGMA8,127440,128341,- For good luck.
iuL1NTNGMA8,128341,129638,"- Oh, I know what it's for."
iuL1NTNGMA8,129638,131610,"I know what it's for you got, ""Bring me that money, baby!"""
iuL1NTNGMA8,131610,133790,"- Thanks, Intel! (laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,133790,135819,"- All right, let's see what you've stolen from the office."
iuL1NTNGMA8,135820,137230,"- [Hoffman] Oh, no."
iuL1NTNGMA8,137230,138250,"No, that's mine!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,138250,139083,Oh.
iuL1NTNGMA8,140340,143550,- Wow! (Hoffman laughs)
iuL1NTNGMA8,143550,148040,Academic excellence and third place doubles!
iuL1NTNGMA8,148040,149650,- I also did Kumon.
iuL1NTNGMA8,149650,152360,"So if you need math questions, just find me, you know."
iuL1NTNGMA8,152360,154390,"- Oh, that is wonderful."
iuL1NTNGMA8,154390,156120,What is level J200?
iuL1NTNGMA8,156120,157510,"- [Hoffman] I don't know, I don't remember."
iuL1NTNGMA8,157510,158342,That was grade eight.
iuL1NTNGMA8,158343,160440,"Oh, can we-- - That's for the study breaks?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,160440,161650,- Is it work now or-- - Keep that
iuL1NTNGMA8,161650,162810,with your academic trophies?
iuL1NTNGMA8,162810,165060,"- Do you want some, I got some soju, as well."
iuL1NTNGMA8,166700,168349,"- Oh, my God, I love it!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,168350,171290,"Wait a second, no, you've told me about your jank mod"
iuL1NTNGMA8,171290,173482,with the PC in the mag case thing.
iuL1NTNGMA8,174613,175957,"Back when we did our thing, you were like,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,175957,177290,"""Oh yeah, I have one, too."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,177290,178657,"And then you showed it to me and I was like,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,178657,180630,"""Oh, that's pretty jank, I think we can do better."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,180630,182010,- Mm-hm.
iuL1NTNGMA8,182010,184610,"- Wow, it looks awesome!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,184610,188057,"Oh, my God, this is like walking into an Apple Store."
iuL1NTNGMA8,188057,190783,(Hoffman laughs) There's just Apple everywhere.
iuL1NTNGMA8,191950,192782,Okay.
iuL1NTNGMA8,193830,197580,"The fact that you still have the G5,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,197580,201320,"like water cooler, shroud things on there,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,201320,203090,you were doing really great!
iuL1NTNGMA8,203090,205110,Really great up until the hard drive
iuL1NTNGMA8,205110,207340,"just being in there. - Oh, that's not"
iuL1NTNGMA8,207340,210390,"the only thing, so. - That dust, though!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,210390,212810,Hoffman! - What's up.
iuL1NTNGMA8,212810,214696,- [Linus] Have you ever cleaned it?
iuL1NTNGMA8,214697,215730,- (scoffs) No.
iuL1NTNGMA8,215730,218010,"You know, when I go to the Apple Store"
iuL1NTNGMA8,218010,219420,at the Genius Bar usually they tell me
iuL1NTNGMA8,219420,221209,"to get a new computer, so. (Linus laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,221210,223480,"- [Linus] Wow, so you actually already have a decent GPU."
iuL1NTNGMA8,223480,226110,Why do you need an RTX 3080?
iuL1NTNGMA8,226110,227553,- Everyone's getting 3080.
iuL1NTNGMA8,228530,229550,'Cause I can.
iuL1NTNGMA8,229550,231020,"- (laughs) Oh, my God."
iuL1NTNGMA8,231020,233170,Are you at least gonna try and get into gaming?
iuL1NTNGMA8,233170,235630,"- Yeah, well, I actually game sometimes."
iuL1NTNGMA8,235630,236712,Look here.
iuL1NTNGMA8,236712,238126,Look at what this is. - We race sometimes.
iuL1NTNGMA8,238126,238959,- Yeah. - Really?
iuL1NTNGMA8,238959,240223,- Yeah!
iuL1NTNGMA8,240223,242980,- I didn't even know you were like a racing game guy.
iuL1NTNGMA8,242980,245717,"- You know, no one has beat my score in Project Cars."
iuL1NTNGMA8,245717,248010,"- Yeah, that's true. - Yeah."
iuL1NTNGMA8,248010,249540,"- You can't beat it, Andy? - No."
iuL1NTNGMA8,249540,250390,- Not even Edzel.
iuL1NTNGMA8,251320,253500,"Before that, Edzel kept talkin' about it in the office."
iuL1NTNGMA8,253500,256320,"He's like, ""Oh, you should play this track."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,256320,257530,And then I played it. - I think someone's getting
iuL1NTNGMA8,257530,258363,called out right now.
iuL1NTNGMA8,258363,259200,"- Yeah, a little bit."
iuL1NTNGMA8,259200,260269,"- Carry on, though. - It's been a year."
iuL1NTNGMA8,260269,261103,- I like it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,261103,262699,"- Can we have some competition, please?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,262699,265560,"- [Andy] We had a chat called ""Race for McDonald's""."
iuL1NTNGMA8,265560,267430,- We only had one race and I won that race.
iuL1NTNGMA8,267430,269979,- I had no idea the editing team was so spicy.
iuL1NTNGMA8,269979,271490,(Hoffman and Andy laugh) And I had no idea
iuL1NTNGMA8,271490,272900,you took my Prusa printer.
iuL1NTNGMA8,272900,275970,"- Oh, it's been so helpful. - (laughs) Okay,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,275970,278220,"I found something, that didn't take that long."
iuL1NTNGMA8,278220,280360,Is this from work? - Yep.
iuL1NTNGMA8,280360,281569,"- Oh, for are crying out loud, dude."
iuL1NTNGMA8,281570,283020,"Is this one of the new M1 ones, too?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,283020,284080,- [Hoffman] Mm-hm.
iuL1NTNGMA8,284080,285689,"- Okay, these were for the lab."
iuL1NTNGMA8,285690,288250,Those are not really actually for internal use.
iuL1NTNGMA8,288250,289860,"- You're fine with this one, though, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,289860,291389,Like this MacBook here?
iuL1NTNGMA8,291390,293774,- Why do you need two MacBooks from the office?
iuL1NTNGMA8,293774,294979,(Andy laughs) Do you realize
iuL1NTNGMA8,294980,297270,"that if everyone took two MacBooks,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,297270,299680,we would need to issue 120 MacBooks?
iuL1NTNGMA8,299680,301160,"- Yeah, but you know, they just sit on the shelf"
iuL1NTNGMA8,301160,303510,'cause no one ever uses MacBooks in our office.
iuL1NTNGMA8,304910,305780,- All right.
iuL1NTNGMA8,305780,308730,Fair enough. (Hoffman and Andy laugh)
iuL1NTNGMA8,308730,311650,"Hey, are these the ones that EK gave out"
iuL1NTNGMA8,311650,313240,at the Christmas party? - Yeah!
iuL1NTNGMA8,313240,314289,- Wow.
iuL1NTNGMA8,314290,315570,Clever budget use.
iuL1NTNGMA8,315570,317640,I'm starting to understand how this happened.
iuL1NTNGMA8,317640,318630,"- No, it's not clever,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,318630,320340,'cause there's another cooler right here.
iuL1NTNGMA8,320340,321508,"- Oh, you have two coolers."
iuL1NTNGMA8,321508,322341,- Yeah. - What the heck?
iuL1NTNGMA8,322341,323710,- Are we building together?
iuL1NTNGMA8,323710,325530,"- Yeah, sure, why not? (Hoffman squeals)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,325530,327230,(Hoffman and Linus laugh)
iuL1NTNGMA8,327230,328063,- Where's your screwdriver?
iuL1NTNGMA8,328063,328896,- Are you gonna bring it--
iuL1NTNGMA8,328896,330432,"Well, in my butt, obviously."
iuL1NTNGMA8,331340,332500,"- No, don't say that."
iuL1NTNGMA8,332500,335470,"Oh, yeah, but seriously, I need you to decide for me."
iuL1NTNGMA8,335470,337110,- Okay. - Can you settle a debate?
iuL1NTNGMA8,337110,338969,Air or water?
iuL1NTNGMA8,338970,339803,- Air.
iuL1NTNGMA8,339803,341030,- Okay. - But maybe water.
iuL1NTNGMA8,341030,342133,- Okay. - All right.
iuL1NTNGMA8,343430,345830,- I learned nothing. (group laughs)
iuL1NTNGMA8,345830,347710,"- This is gonna be your NAS then, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,347710,348930,- Yep. - Have you given any thought
iuL1NTNGMA8,348930,350729,to networking at all or... - No.
iuL1NTNGMA8,350730,352530,"- No, so do you have a Switch?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,352530,353363,- No.
iuL1NTNGMA8,353363,358240,- How are you going to access your files on the NAS?
iuL1NTNGMA8,358240,359639,- That's something you have to teach me.
iuL1NTNGMA8,359640,360670,"- Oh, my gosh."
iuL1NTNGMA8,360670,362390,We're gonna end up going shopping today.
iuL1NTNGMA8,362390,363240,"- No, we're not, we're not."
iuL1NTNGMA8,363240,365750,I have a really long cable I stole from work.
iuL1NTNGMA8,365750,368020,Like ethernet cable that we can run
iuL1NTNGMA8,368020,370660,from the router to my room for now.
iuL1NTNGMA8,370660,373288,- There's so many things wrong with what you just said.
iuL1NTNGMA8,373288,375419,(group laughs) - I don't even know
iuL1NTNGMA8,375420,376860,where to begin.
iuL1NTNGMA8,376860,378919,Is this a super microboard?
iuL1NTNGMA8,378920,380693,"- It's, yeah. - How do you have this?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,380693,382759,- Got a Zion in there.
iuL1NTNGMA8,382760,383710,- Is it from work?
iuL1NTNGMA8,383710,386300,"- No, I got it from Craigslist."
iuL1NTNGMA8,386300,387539,- Okay.
iuL1NTNGMA8,387540,389610,"So, basically we don't need to change anything about this"
iuL1NTNGMA8,389610,390919,other than to blow some dust out of it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,390920,392430,"- Exactly. - Oh, that's not too bad."
iuL1NTNGMA8,392430,393263,"- Yeah, I was like, ""It's not too bad."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,394150,395590,"Andy, that's not too bad, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,395590,396423,- [Andy] Ehh.
iuL1NTNGMA8,396423,398170,"- Not as bad David's, honestly."
iuL1NTNGMA8,398170,399770,- David's was the worst. - Yep.
iuL1NTNGMA8,400870,403050,"- [Linus] Wait, why didn't you go 12th Gen?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,403050,405699,"- [Hoffman] Oh, 'cause I made this whole list"
iuL1NTNGMA8,405700,407386,like couple months back.
iuL1NTNGMA8,407386,408219,- Oh.
iuL1NTNGMA8,409398,411379,You got screwed by the bad timing
iuL1NTNGMA8,411379,412500,of the 12th Gen release. - A little bit.
iuL1NTNGMA8,412500,415200,"- I mean it's still very, very fast CPU."
iuL1NTNGMA8,415200,418320,"- So I think we, this thing, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,418320,419153,"That's the CPU. - Wait, you know"
iuL1NTNGMA8,419153,420220,"how to build a computer, come on."
iuL1NTNGMA8,420220,422470,"- Kind of. - Stop pretending,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,422470,423303,"I mean, you built that, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,423303,424550,"- No, I didn't. - Oh, really?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,424550,425703,"- No, it came as a whole. - Oh!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,425703,427700,- That's why it's so cheap.
iuL1NTNGMA8,427700,429580,"- Oh, but didn't you build your Mac?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,429580,430636,- I did. - Okay.
iuL1NTNGMA8,430636,432043,"- That was a long time ago. - I was gonna say,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,432044,433073,actually. - Took me a month to do it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,433073,435100,"- That was a while, okay."
iuL1NTNGMA8,435100,436900,- Corner to corner.
iuL1NTNGMA8,436900,438060,Which corner is that?
iuL1NTNGMA8,438060,439500,"That corner, okay, cool."
iuL1NTNGMA8,439500,440690,And then I see that you always wiggle it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,440690,442630,- Yeah. - And then you close it
iuL1NTNGMA8,442630,444230,and then that thing will pop up.
iuL1NTNGMA8,445750,446900,Ta-da! - He knows how
iuL1NTNGMA8,446900,449129,"to build a computer! - Yeah. the, the, the--"
iuL1NTNGMA8,449129,451216,- The speed is like-- - The system works!
iuL1NTNGMA8,451216,452240,(Hoffman laughs)
iuL1NTNGMA8,452240,454039,- Make sure you gotta keep this flap right here
iuL1NTNGMA8,454040,456660,just in case you gotta RMA it or something like that?
iuL1NTNGMA8,456660,457880,"- Okay, all right."
iuL1NTNGMA8,457880,459520,Are you done takin' the piss?
iuL1NTNGMA8,459520,461000,- And then we got--
iuL1NTNGMA8,461000,462200,I forgot what these are.
iuL1NTNGMA8,463232,464389,Two sticks of 16GB?
iuL1NTNGMA8,464390,467320,"- Stop, I forgot what these are."
iuL1NTNGMA8,467320,469100,"Enough! - No, I meant"
iuL1NTNGMA8,469100,470350,like the memory
iuL1NTNGMA8,470350,471910,like how much there is. - Rom?
iuL1NTNGMA8,471910,473480,- RAM. - Rom?
iuL1NTNGMA8,473480,474650,Rim?
iuL1NTNGMA8,474650,475798,Rub?
iuL1NTNGMA8,475798,477800,(guys laughing)
iuL1NTNGMA8,477800,479080,Two sticks of 16GB.
iuL1NTNGMA8,479080,481650,"3600 CL 16, 16GB."
iuL1NTNGMA8,481650,482483,Nice!
iuL1NTNGMA8,482483,485318,"- This is the part that gets crunchy, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,485318,486400,(loud clicking)
iuL1NTNGMA8,486400,487930,"Oh, that crunch is healthy, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,487930,489740,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a good crunch."
iuL1NTNGMA8,489740,492370,Now I'm craving Captain Crunch all of a sudden.
iuL1NTNGMA8,492370,493510,"Honestly, this is going so well."
iuL1NTNGMA8,493510,494940,I feel like you don't really need me anymore.
iuL1NTNGMA8,494940,495773,- Mm-hm.
iuL1NTNGMA8,495773,497800,- Just be Hoffman Tech Tips. - Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,497800,499310,"- You have so much tech tips, though."
iuL1NTNGMA8,499311,500670,- [Linus] Hoh-teh-tih.
iuL1NTNGMA8,500670,501737,- Huh?
iuL1NTNGMA8,501737,502570,- Hoh-teh-tih.
iuL1NTNGMA8,502570,503403,- What's--
iuL1NTNGMA8,503403,505310,Is that like a baby singing Linus Tech Tips or--
iuL1NTNGMA8,505310,506926,- Hoffman Tech Tips. - Oh.
iuL1NTNGMA8,506926,509860,"- [Andy] Oh, you know my kid just learn how to say LTT?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,509860,510879,"- Oh, really? - Really?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,510880,512469,"- [Andy] Yeah, 'cause I'm wearing the LTT thing"
iuL1NTNGMA8,512469,516693,"and he always points at it and he's like, ""LTT."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,516693,520586,"- That's so cute. - Oh, my gosh! (laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,520586,524270,"(soft upbeat music) Oh, my God, that's so strong!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,524270,525920,Linus! (shouts)
iuL1NTNGMA8,525920,527636,"- I was like, ""Kyle, I want the biggest"
iuL1NTNGMA8,527637,529860,"""possible magnet embedded in the shaft."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,529860,531860,"He's like, ""Is this big enough?"""
iuL1NTNGMA8,531860,533537,"I'm like, ""Is it the biggest possible magnet?"""
iuL1NTNGMA8,533537,534370,"""No."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,534370,536050,"""Well, then it's not big enough, is it?"""
iuL1NTNGMA8,536050,537459,The screws don't come off!
iuL1NTNGMA8,537460,538293,- [Hoffman] I like that.
iuL1NTNGMA8,538293,540580,I'm gonna steal one when it's out.
iuL1NTNGMA8,540580,541413,- Let's get the case.
iuL1NTNGMA8,541413,542246,"Oh, it's there."
iuL1NTNGMA8,542246,543120,- It is there.
iuL1NTNGMA8,543120,546601,"We don't have to go to the store and buy it, so."
iuL1NTNGMA8,546601,547434,Ta-da!
iuL1NTNGMA8,547434,549230,Okay. - Why are you takin' digs
iuL1NTNGMA8,549230,551430,"at Edzel, takin' digs at Nicole?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,551430,554220,Is he like the department troll or what?
iuL1NTNGMA8,554220,556290,- It's a white case!
iuL1NTNGMA8,556290,557180,It's pretty!
iuL1NTNGMA8,557180,558540,- It is pretty.
iuL1NTNGMA8,558540,561560,But the thing we gotta figure out is our cooling solutions.
iuL1NTNGMA8,561560,564010,"I would go with the NH-D15 personally,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,564010,566230,because I just don't like hassle.
iuL1NTNGMA8,566230,568690,- Mm-hm. - And an air cooler
iuL1NTNGMA8,568690,570913,with two fans on it is basically--
iuL1NTNGMA8,570913,572860,- Good to go? - Bulletproof.
iuL1NTNGMA8,572860,574170,It'll be running in 10 years.
iuL1NTNGMA8,574170,576540,I give you my personal Linus Tech Tips Guarantee.
iuL1NTNGMA8,576540,578850,"- But the AIO is more expensive, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,578850,580329,"- [Linus] The AIO is more expensive,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,580330,581163,yeah. - And it looks prettier.
iuL1NTNGMA8,581163,581996,- [Linus] It looks prettier.
iuL1NTNGMA8,581996,583730,- I need a hobby so I think we should use
iuL1NTNGMA8,583730,585139,"the AIO. - Okay, we're goin' AIO."
iuL1NTNGMA8,585140,586160,Let's do it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,586160,587800,So have you ever installed an AIO before?
iuL1NTNGMA8,587800,588730,- Nope!
iuL1NTNGMA8,588730,591620,"- Okay, so now we're crossing new ground with you,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,591620,593940,Mister Is this the RAM?
iuL1NTNGMA8,593940,597010,"- I mean, I've seen you struggle with the AIO all the time."
iuL1NTNGMA8,597010,599600,"- You know, Mr. Smack-talk here,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,599600,601410,it's a pretty good idea to make sure
iuL1NTNGMA8,601410,603209,that you're gonna be better at it
iuL1NTNGMA8,603210,604970,before you come at someone else
iuL1NTNGMA8,604970,607000,"about how much they struggled,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,607000,609713,'cause I'm getting real unhelpful feelin'.
iuL1NTNGMA8,609713,612213,(guys laughing) I gotta say.
iuL1NTNGMA8,614090,615050,- That's a cooler.
iuL1NTNGMA8,615050,615883,- Yep.
iuL1NTNGMA8,615883,617370,- Am I gonna do it or...
iuL1NTNGMA8,617370,619000,- I told you I wasn't feeling very helpful.
iuL1NTNGMA8,619000,619833,I really-- - Where are
iuL1NTNGMA8,619833,621580,"the tech tips, Linus? (laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,621580,623680,"Wait, don't you have to install this before--"
iuL1NTNGMA8,623680,624990,Install the motherboard before this?
iuL1NTNGMA8,624990,625823,- I don't know.
iuL1NTNGMA8,625823,626950,"- Oh, it's a quiz. - I've developed"
iuL1NTNGMA8,626950,629155,some amnesia here. (Hoffman groans)
iuL1NTNGMA8,629155,630210,- What is this again?
iuL1NTNGMA8,630210,631043,- What is what?
iuL1NTNGMA8,631043,632845,- Wha-tour culling?
iuL1NTNGMA8,632845,633678,- Huh?
iuL1NTNGMA8,635850,637211,Is that a reference again?
iuL1NTNGMA8,637211,638100,- (sighs) No.
iuL1NTNGMA8,638100,640089,- Oh. - We can put this in now
iuL1NTNGMA8,640090,641167,or we can put the motherboard in now
iuL1NTNGMA8,641167,642670,and we can install this after.
iuL1NTNGMA8,642670,643620,It doesn't really matter.
iuL1NTNGMA8,643620,644453,- Okay!
iuL1NTNGMA8,644453,646040,- [Andy] If you put that in the front--
iuL1NTNGMA8,646040,648040,- Yeah. - Will the GPU fit?
iuL1NTNGMA8,648040,649370,"- Oh, crap."
iuL1NTNGMA8,649370,650320,Is that what happened last time?
iuL1NTNGMA8,650320,652080,"No, no, that was with the other case, Andy."
iuL1NTNGMA8,652080,652913,- Yes.
iuL1NTNGMA8,652913,654280,"You're right, though, let's make sure."
iuL1NTNGMA8,654280,655113,Yep.
iuL1NTNGMA8,655113,656660,"Easy-peasy, no problem."
iuL1NTNGMA8,656660,658076,"- See that, Nicole?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,658076,660250,(guys laughing)
iuL1NTNGMA8,660250,661347,"- You know she's your supervisor now,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,661347,662640,"right? - Yeah, she is."
iuL1NTNGMA8,662640,664000,"- Okay. - Yeah, so what?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,664000,664900,She can't fire me.
iuL1NTNGMA8,664900,667390,- She can advise that you should be fired.
iuL1NTNGMA8,667390,668680,"- Oh, sorry, Nicole."
iuL1NTNGMA8,668680,670027,"Nicole, you're amazing."
iuL1NTNGMA8,670027,671829,(Hoffman laughs) - She is amazing.
iuL1NTNGMA8,671830,673330,You're also gonna need to pop the front panel.
iuL1NTNGMA8,673330,675203,"Yeah, just grab the bottom and pull out"
iuL1NTNGMA8,675203,677570,with a jerking motion.
iuL1NTNGMA8,677570,679235,"Yeah, jerk it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,679235,680639,(Hoffman grunts)
iuL1NTNGMA8,680639,681610,- Do you wanna jerk it?
iuL1NTNGMA8,681610,683042,Would you jerk it
iuL1NTNGMA8,683042,684420,for me? (laughs) (Andy laughs)
iuL1NTNGMA8,684420,685740,"- Oh wait, is this screwed on?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,685740,687600,"- Oh thank, God I didn't force it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,687600,689806,"So that's how we break things on camera sometimes, huh?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,689806,691040,(Hoffman laughs) - Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,691040,693600,Do you want looks or do you want convenience?
iuL1NTNGMA8,693600,694730,The best looking-- - Looks.
iuL1NTNGMA8,694730,695839,- You want looks. - Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,695840,697890,- Can I talk you into convenience?
iuL1NTNGMA8,697890,698740,"- Okay, yeah, let's do it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,698740,699830,"- Okay, let's do convenience."
iuL1NTNGMA8,699830,702020,So we're gonna have the radiator fins right at the front
iuL1NTNGMA8,702020,703840,and we're gonna have the fans pulling air
iuL1NTNGMA8,703840,705430,through the radiator at the backs.
iuL1NTNGMA8,705430,707070,If you put the fans at the front
iuL1NTNGMA8,707070,709800,"and they blow air into the radiator,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,709800,711519,then you have to take the whole thing apart
iuL1NTNGMA8,711520,713010,in order to clean the dust out of it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,713010,715240,And I've seen how much you like doing maintenance
iuL1NTNGMA8,715240,716330,on your computer.
iuL1NTNGMA8,716330,720130,- Did we ever do any tests about the stock paste?
iuL1NTNGMA8,720130,721980,"- Oh, EK ships decent paste with their stuff"
iuL1NTNGMA8,721980,723300,so I wouldn't worry about that.
iuL1NTNGMA8,723300,726930,There are manufacturers that ship super cheap paste
iuL1NTNGMA8,726930,729500,"with their products, but, honestly,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,729500,731860,I would just assume this is fine and use it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,731860,734529,"Okay, maybe you could get a degree,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,734530,737300,even two degrees with something else but...
iuL1NTNGMA8,737300,738259,"- Oh, I thought, (laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,738259,740019,I thought you were telling me to go back to university.
iuL1NTNGMA8,740020,741407,"- Oh no, no, no."
iuL1NTNGMA8,741407,743199,"No, Kumon is all you need."
iuL1NTNGMA8,743199,744339,(Andy and Hoffman laugh)
iuL1NTNGMA8,744340,747530,"Gee, Hoffman, you know, I think you could be not (beeps)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,747530,750100,"if you just got some more education, you know?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,750100,751160,"- Oh, (beeps)."
iuL1NTNGMA8,751160,752779,- It's like out of nowhere...
iuL1NTNGMA8,752780,754300,"- You know I'm working for you, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,754300,756899,"- Yeah, I guess it speaks to my poor taste if you suck."
iuL1NTNGMA8,756900,759630,And we're gonna be done this build in no time.
iuL1NTNGMA8,759630,760680,"I love it. - See, Andy,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,760680,761960,"I told you, it's gonna be easy."
iuL1NTNGMA8,761960,764280,- And I love these accents.
iuL1NTNGMA8,764280,768510,Why do you have a 40 pack of anodized aluminum washers?
iuL1NTNGMA8,768510,770910,- They're like (sighs) why not?
iuL1NTNGMA8,770910,772269,- But what are they for?
iuL1NTNGMA8,772270,773220,- Oh!
iuL1NTNGMA8,773220,774516,Is it the motherboard?
iuL1NTNGMA8,774517,776378,"Yeah, it is. - For the motherboard."
iuL1NTNGMA8,776378,777533,"- I think so, yeah."
iuL1NTNGMA8,777533,779440,"- Dude, I don't think so."
iuL1NTNGMA8,779440,780610,Is that what these are for?
iuL1NTNGMA8,780610,781443,- Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,781443,783899,- But I have never heard of people
iuL1NTNGMA8,783900,788900,just like putting things on there like that and for bling.
iuL1NTNGMA8,789240,792060,Maybe I'm just not cool anymore?
iuL1NTNGMA8,792060,793920,"- No, you're the coolest."
iuL1NTNGMA8,793920,795410,"- Oh, stop."
iuL1NTNGMA8,795410,796930,"- It's safe, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,796930,799029,"- I mean, I wouldn't do it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,799030,801890,"- That's okay, as long as it looks cool."
iuL1NTNGMA8,801890,803600,- [Linus] Not gonna lie.
iuL1NTNGMA8,803600,805370,That looks pretty cool.
iuL1NTNGMA8,805370,808790,"- Oh, I have CableMod cables, actually."
iuL1NTNGMA8,808790,810329,- Do you? - I do.
iuL1NTNGMA8,810330,812260,Like that. - Wow.
iuL1NTNGMA8,812260,814320,- [Hoffman] And got some gold accents too.
iuL1NTNGMA8,814320,816540,"- [Linus] White, black and pink."
iuL1NTNGMA8,816540,817373,"- Well, it's gray."
iuL1NTNGMA8,817373,819690,- With gold accents.
iuL1NTNGMA8,819690,821180,"- Bling, bling."
iuL1NTNGMA8,821180,822810,"- I mean,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,822810,824610,"wear it loud, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,824610,825540,"- You like it, you like it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,825540,827259,- I do like it. (Hoffman laughs)
iuL1NTNGMA8,827260,828980,Gotta love those cable combs.
iuL1NTNGMA8,828980,833970,You go from like tangled to dangle.
iuL1NTNGMA8,833970,835740,- I wish my life could be like that.
iuL1NTNGMA8,835740,837209,"- Good, solid power supply."
iuL1NTNGMA8,837210,839500,We've gone with an RM850x.
iuL1NTNGMA8,839500,842950,- Are you gonna comment on 850 on a 3080?
iuL1NTNGMA8,842950,844410,- It's fine.
iuL1NTNGMA8,844410,846579,"I mean, people have done much worse."
iuL1NTNGMA8,846580,848733,"James tried to get away with a 650, didn't he?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,848733,850139,- I don't remember. - I can't remember.
iuL1NTNGMA8,850140,851080,That didn't work out.
iuL1NTNGMA8,851080,853520,"Actually, two of the ones that I warned"
iuL1NTNGMA8,853520,856170,about their power supply have had their power supply
iuL1NTNGMA8,856170,859480,either fail or their system (snaps) shut off sometimes
iuL1NTNGMA8,859480,861178,and they have had to replace their power supplies.
iuL1NTNGMA8,861178,863320,- [Andy] My power supply exploded.
iuL1NTNGMA8,863320,864230,- Yours was no good?
iuL1NTNGMA8,864230,866810,"I wasn't even counting you so that means three, then."
iuL1NTNGMA8,866810,867850,"Well it's not pretty,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,867850,871639,but I think we dealt with your super long cable here.
iuL1NTNGMA8,871640,874960,Let's see if that panel's even gonna close. (chuckles)
iuL1NTNGMA8,874960,876220,"Oh, yeah, there it is, thanks."
iuL1NTNGMA8,876220,878647,"People ask me, ""Linus, why you work out, you know?"""
iuL1NTNGMA8,878647,880759,"""Why you try to get such a big booty."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,880760,881960,So I can close the case.
iuL1NTNGMA8,883750,886800,"- All right, hey, not bad!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,886800,888040,"Let's get that GPU installed,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,888040,888873,right? - Let's do it!
iuL1NTNGMA8,888873,890320,Here you go.
iuL1NTNGMA8,890320,891420,"- Well, no, you're gonna do it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,891420,892769,That's your job.
iuL1NTNGMA8,892770,894063,"- [Hoffman] Oh, that's true."
iuL1NTNGMA8,897769,899500,"- [Linus] We're gonna just have a big loop on this, I guess,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,899500,901610,because I screwed up.
iuL1NTNGMA8,901610,903930,"- Well, that's perfect 'cause I paid for those cables."
iuL1NTNGMA8,903930,904763,I wanna see more of it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,904763,905596,- [Linus] Good.
iuL1NTNGMA8,906440,908380,More bang for your buck. - (laughs) Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,908380,909303,- Sick!
iuL1NTNGMA8,910179,912890,(claps) Let's find out if it works.
iuL1NTNGMA8,912890,913723,"You ready, no, you do it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,913723,914810,You do the honors.
iuL1NTNGMA8,914810,915955,"- No, you know what, you do it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,915955,917049,"- No, you gotta do it. - No, you do it"
iuL1NTNGMA8,917049,917882,'cause you built it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,917882,918715,"- No, you gotta do you it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,918715,919548,This is your machine. - You named it Fluffy Bunny.
iuL1NTNGMA8,919548,920957,- Fluffy Bunny. - It's your machine.
iuL1NTNGMA8,920957,922730,- But you built it. - But you configured it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,922730,923563,"- Okay, fine."
iuL1NTNGMA8,923563,924396,Can we do it together?
iuL1NTNGMA8,924396,926263,"- We can do it together, okay. - Ready?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,928400,929390,- Crap. (Hoffman snickers)
iuL1NTNGMA8,929390,930661,Did you turn it on the power supply?
iuL1NTNGMA8,930661,931880,"- I did not, I did not."
iuL1NTNGMA8,931880,932713,"I did not, ready?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,932713,934100,"- Okay, try again, try again."
iuL1NTNGMA8,935115,937294,"(Hoffman laughs) Oh, crap."
iuL1NTNGMA8,937294,940513,"There you go, yay! - Ooh! (laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,940513,942110,"- Hey, I love this!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,942110,943587,Stolen from work.
iuL1NTNGMA8,943587,945302,"""The ABC's of Gaming."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,945302,946135,- [Andy] Can we go to L?
iuL1NTNGMA8,946135,947850,"- Yeah, we can go to L, is that your favorite?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,947850,949300,"- What's, what's L?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,949300,952662,"- L is for loot. - No, L is for LTTStore.com!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,953600,955430,"- Thanks, Andy. (guys laughing)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,955430,958160,"Oh boy, it hasn't turned on yet."
iuL1NTNGMA8,958160,959139,- How do you know?
iuL1NTNGMA8,959140,960560,"- Well, 'cause it, oh, oh,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,960560,962230,the monitor was off. - It was off.
iuL1NTNGMA8,962230,964029,- Hey!
iuL1NTNGMA8,964030,965630,Nice!
iuL1NTNGMA8,965630,968410,Everything looks totally fine.
iuL1NTNGMA8,968410,969920,"Whoop, what mouse are we using?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,969920,971130,"Really, Hoffman?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,971130,972670,- Yeah. - The least ergonomic mouse
iuL1NTNGMA8,972670,973769,of all time.
iuL1NTNGMA8,973770,974930,"- You know, what's the best for this"
iuL1NTNGMA8,974930,976640,is slipping into pockets.
iuL1NTNGMA8,976640,979670,- That's actually valid.
iuL1NTNGMA8,979670,981550,"- You know, I actually used this as a clicker"
iuL1NTNGMA8,981550,983120,for PowerPoint when I was in university.
iuL1NTNGMA8,983120,984250,I would tape the bottom
iuL1NTNGMA8,984250,986830,and then hide it in my pocket and click it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,986830,988390,"- Wow, that's slick. (Hoffman laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,988390,989240,"- Yeah. - I like it,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,989240,990420,actually. - Yeah!
iuL1NTNGMA8,990420,991730,That's the only thing it's good for.
iuL1NTNGMA8,991730,993089,"Yeah, so I have a DeckLink."
iuL1NTNGMA8,993090,997310,Like if I pass this all the Nvidia driver system OS
iuL1NTNGMA8,997310,998370,color management stuff.
iuL1NTNGMA8,998370,1001560,So that we can have a clean output to the TV.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1001560,1002810,- On that TV. - Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1002810,1004760,So you'll sit in bed with a wireless keyboard
iuL1NTNGMA8,1004760,1007480,and mouse or something and be working in the--
iuL1NTNGMA8,1007480,1009709,"- No, I can just look..."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1009710,1010710,"Well, okay."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1010710,1012670,- I question your ergonomics. - Okay.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1012670,1015709,- Your touchpad for this computer is here
iuL1NTNGMA8,1015710,1018360,and then you're gonna have your color accurate output
iuL1NTNGMA8,1018360,1021570,for this computer over there.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1021570,1024189,- This computer actually goes with this monitor.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1024189,1025470,- I see. - Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1025470,1027669,So this is the Windows computer.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1027670,1029990,- How many computers does one person need?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1029990,1032083,"How did I not notice this? - Oh, Lord."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1033020,1034189,"I'm sorry. - Oh, my God."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1034189,1035679,Your paint's coming off your wall.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1035680,1037949,Did you stick this up with just double-sided tape?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1037949,1039809,"- [Hoffman] Yeah, I did."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1039810,1042290,(Linus snorts)
iuL1NTNGMA8,1042290,1043990,"- Classic, let's go get the NAS going."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1043990,1046260,Do you have any hardware for this case?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1046260,1048810,This is an older case and it requires those special screws
iuL1NTNGMA8,1048810,1051526,with the spacers for hard drive mounting.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1051526,1053130,"- No. - No, huh?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1053130,1055920,I mean we could just do it the Hoffman way.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1055920,1058940,Just rest it on there and put it in.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1058940,1060490,"There, hard drive installed, right?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1060490,1061386,"Right, Hoffman?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1061386,1062750,- (chuckles) Yes.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1062750,1064830,Can I Swiffer the inside? - Let's power it up.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1064830,1066190,"- I don't know, can you?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1066190,1069009,"- This is a good budget kind of editing setup, huh?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1069010,1071260,Like the whole PC and the NAS?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1071260,1072093,- I love it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1072093,1072926,- Yeah. - I love it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1072926,1075060,"You need to not have a GTX 580 in here, though."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1075060,1077822,That's phenomenally stupid.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1077822,1079270,- (chuckles) What should I have in there?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1079270,1080600,- Nothing.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1080600,1081433,- Wait. - You should use
iuL1NTNGMA8,1081433,1083230,the onboard video that's definitely on here.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1083230,1084486,"- [Hoffman] Oh, okay."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1084486,1085319,- (chuckles) Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1085319,1086159,"All right, that was it."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1086160,1087427,That was your big cleaning effort?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1087427,1088560,"Unbelievable. - Yeah, what?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1088560,1089840,- 'Kay. - What else is there?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1089840,1090950,- I don't even care. - Okay.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1090950,1092070,- Doesn't even matter.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1092070,1094500,I think you should call it Big NAS-X
iuL1NTNGMA8,1094500,1096720,"because it's big and it's-- - Oh, my God."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1096720,1098275,"I just wasn't really expecting pop,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1098275,1101560,like new young pop culture from you.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1101560,1103520,"- Yeah, thanks. (Andy laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1103520,1106500,What if you put that one on top of this one?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1106500,1108700,"- Oh, that's pretty crazy. - You stack 'em."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1109950,1111070,Oh!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1111070,1111903,- What was that?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1111903,1113480,"- Okay, let's do the peel."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1113480,1114410,- [Hoffman] Peel everything.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1114410,1115790,- Peel all the things. - Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1115790,1117200,"- Suck it, Andy."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1117200,1119891,I'm gonna sneak into your house and peel all your (beep).
iuL1NTNGMA8,1119891,1122270,- [Andy] I still have the fridge peel waiting for you.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1122270,1123200,- Oh!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1123200,1125350,Now we are definitely giving up some cooling
iuL1NTNGMA8,1125350,1126580,"on the bottom of this one,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1126580,1128519,but I really don't think it's a big deal.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1128520,1129720,We got like three hard drives in there
iuL1NTNGMA8,1129720,1132260,and we're definitely gonna take out that GTX 580.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1132260,1133920,"- [Hoffman] I could sell it for a bit, huh?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1133920,1135320,"- [Linus] I don't know, maybe 20 bucks."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1135320,1136153,- [Hoffman] Oops.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1136153,1138297,- Even now it's not worth much.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1138297,1141417,"""Overcurrent have been detected on your USB device."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1141417,1143780,"""System will shut down to protect your main board."""
iuL1NTNGMA8,1143780,1146140,"What did you plug in, my man?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1146140,1148320,- Maybe the keyboard?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1148320,1150559,- [Linus] Is this cable safe?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1150560,1151780,- [Linus] I think so.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1151780,1152613,- [Linus] Hmm.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1152613,1154180,- You can figure it out.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1154180,1155480,"- I'm not gonna lie, Andy."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1156340,1158940,I am extra confused right now.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1158940,1159840,Did we miss something?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1159840,1161600,Did we accidentally get
iuL1NTNGMA8,1163082,1164270,one of the little metal tabs
iuL1NTNGMA8,1164270,1165700,in one of the USB ports or something?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1165700,1167340,"No, there's nothing."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1167340,1169500,I can't tell if these are queued up errors
iuL1NTNGMA8,1169500,1171470,or if they're new ones.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1171470,1173460,I'm gonna get some drivers installed
iuL1NTNGMA8,1173460,1174890,and then we're gonna see how that goes.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1174890,1176410,"- Okay, sounds good."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1176410,1177380,Look at these!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1177380,1178793,I got the HS8s.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1179760,1180670,They are big.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1180670,1182170,They are eight-inch subs.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1182170,1184350,There are other smaller subs but I went for the eight
iuL1NTNGMA8,1184350,1187630,because it's like the endgame speakers for me.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1187630,1192093,Audio is 50% of the video and I wanna get better at it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1193100,1195630,And these speakers are really gonna help me.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1195630,1198440,"With studio monitors, they're usually very flat sounding"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1198440,1200360,"and not much flavor in them,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1200360,1203130,just so that we can have a more accurate reference.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1203130,1207120,"So I'm not expecting these to really boom my room,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1207120,1211480,but I really wanna hear all the range in the frequency.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1211480,1213870,And these are gonna do just fine for that.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1213870,1217370,I've mixed a couple videos with my old speakers
iuL1NTNGMA8,1217370,1219068,and there's a lot of complaints
iuL1NTNGMA8,1219068,1220370,in the comments. - Hoffman!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1220370,1221930,"- Yeah, Linus?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1221930,1223980,- [Linus] What on earth did you plug
iuL1NTNGMA8,1223980,1226210,that ethernet port into?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1226210,1227043,- Oh.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1227043,1230073,- Is this a 100Mbps port?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1231000,1232340,- [Hoffman] Shouldn't be.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1232340,1233809,- [Linus] Something smells bad.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1233810,1234643,- What?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1234643,1236070,- Sometimes you get a little bit of corrosion
iuL1NTNGMA8,1236070,1237090,on the connections and if you just give it
iuL1NTNGMA8,1237090,1241409,"a little unpluggy-pluggy, it'll smarten up."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1241410,1243410,I think I speak for everyone when I say that eight inch
iuL1NTNGMA8,1243410,1244750,is really too much.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1244750,1245583,"- Yeah, it is."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1245583,1247010,"- Yeah. - Yeah, for my rooms."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1247010,1249293,"- Four, five that's lots."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1250280,1251630,"- Oh, what are you talkin' about?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1251630,1253653,- I sort of figured out the USB thing.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1254500,1257470,Your keyboard does not like being plugged
iuL1NTNGMA8,1257470,1258909,into a USB Type-A port.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1258910,1260070,- Oh. - So I plugged it
iuL1NTNGMA8,1260070,1262669,into the Type-C and it (snaps) immediately lit up.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1262670,1265710,I stopped getting that error as soon as I reseeded
iuL1NTNGMA8,1265710,1268970,the internal USB Type-C header
iuL1NTNGMA8,1268970,1271630,so I'm hoping that we're good to go now.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1271630,1272570,- So it was your fault.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1272570,1274440,- That's one way of putting it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1274440,1275610,"- That's all right, Linus."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1275610,1277230,"Well, the fact that you made a mistake"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1277230,1280856,"and corrected it, you know, (chuckles) that's a lot."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1280857,1281740,"- [Linus] That's what life's all about,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1281740,1282890,right? - Yep.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1282890,1284150,Is it turning on?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1284150,1284983,- [Linus] No.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1284983,1285816,"- Oh, Lord."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1287120,1288641,- Wait! - Oh.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1288641,1289474,Oh. - I hear some--
iuL1NTNGMA8,1289474,1290370,"Oh, God. - Oh, my God."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1290370,1293040,Look at how big this is.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1293040,1295030,"- Oh, my God."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1295030,1298890,- The eight-inch is definitely overkill for this room.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1298890,1300763,"A hundred percent. - Uh, yeah!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1303673,1305220,You're like right there!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1305220,1309120,"(Hoffman laughs) This is ridiculous, dude!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1309120,1312750,- I have a C1 right here.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1312750,1315820,"For SDR grading, this TV's actually perfect."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1315820,1319073,HDR's not actually that good because it is WOLED.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1320100,1323549,So that means it's got RGB pixels plus a white pixel
iuL1NTNGMA8,1323550,1326700,"so when you go very bright in a scene,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1326700,1329100,the saturation will actually down.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1329100,1331390,"Before SDR, totally good."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1332329,1335079,(loud whooshing)
iuL1NTNGMA8,1336260,1337650,- This looks great!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1337650,1339420,- [Hoffman] Uh-huh!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1339420,1340560,- Perfect.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1340560,1341393,"Ready, it's a good thing"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1341393,1342751,"it was on right, eh? - Yeah."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1342751,1343584,- Yeah!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1343584,1344670,"'Kay, so you tell me where you want it,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1344670,1346590,'cause that does not look very--
iuL1NTNGMA8,1346590,1348010,"- Counterclockwise, please."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1348010,1348940,- My counterclock--
iuL1NTNGMA8,1348940,1350450,"Okay, that's all I got."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1350450,1351779,"- Do it, go ahead."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1351780,1353060,That's perfect.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1353060,1354120,- How's that?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1354120,1355059,"- Yeah, sure."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1355060,1357190,"- Yeah, sure. (Hoffman laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1357190,1358269,All right.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1358270,1360170,"Yeah, this is not very level, Hoffman."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1360170,1361663,"You've got a solid,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1362750,1364057,frickin'-- - 5 degrees
iuL1NTNGMA8,1364901,1366790,or 10.- - Like inch or two
iuL1NTNGMA8,1366790,1368380,from one end to the next.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1368380,1370790,"Poor Hoffman, is gonna edit someone's portrait"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1370790,1372297,"and send it to them and they're gonna be like,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1372297,1374797,"""Why is it like this?"" (laughs)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1376030,1377870,Let's go back to the NAS.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1377870,1381340,So the way I configured it is you're gonna have 16TB
iuL1NTNGMA8,1381340,1383799,of usable space out of 24. - Nice.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1383800,1386800,"- But what's cool is that as you add more drives,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1386800,1388840,that's all gonna be pure capacity.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1388840,1393400,"So as long every drive you add is 8TB or less,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1393400,1395430,you just get the full capacity of those drives
iuL1NTNGMA8,1395430,1397949,and you can add any (beep) mix of drives that you want.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1397949,1401299,(upbeat music)
iuL1NTNGMA8,1401300,1403100,Those are really tight.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1403100,1404130,- Tight as in...
iuL1NTNGMA8,1404130,1405070,- Like... - Good?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1405070,1406500,"- Good. - Oh, that's good."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1406500,1407333,That's good.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1407333,1408166,- How much were these?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1409000,1411760,"- 3, 4, 500, around that range per,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1411760,1414466,so it was like less than a thousand dollars for a pair.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1414466,1416033,- Should we just have something like this
iuL1NTNGMA8,1416034,1417377,in the booths at work?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1417377,1419250,"- I mean we could, but we need to isolate"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1419250,1423190,"the sound of the room, but I actually,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1423190,1427610,I was working from home and I managed to actually mix
iuL1NTNGMA8,1427610,1428830,a video on these. - Woof!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1428830,1429990,"- I'm gonna check on my dog,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1429990,1431166,"I'm sorry. - Oh, sure."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1431166,1433230,- [Men On Video] CPUs are hot!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1433230,1434260,- Whoa!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1434260,1437340,"That is very stereo, sir!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1437340,1439257,- Right? - Yeah!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1439257,1441047,- You can hear everything with these.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1441047,1442160,- You can really hear it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1442160,1444270,It's like head phone level separation.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1444270,1445620,That's really cool.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1445620,1446599,All right.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1446599,1447900,"'Kay, LG, hello!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1447900,1450403,Why would anyone have a TV subscription?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1451330,1453289,There should be an option for none.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1453290,1455790,"- It's like in case my grandma gets a TV, I guess."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1456790,1457880,- Roasted.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1457880,1459930,"- Oh, the blacks, it's so good."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1459930,1462150,"I mean, it's off, but... (TV dings)"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1462150,1465040,- We can lay the bed down and watch something.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1465040,1466840,"- Okay, I mean, that's not awkward."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1466840,1467852,"- Yeah, well."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1469218,1472209,- [Andy] And there's no bed frame so you can't break it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1472209,1474440,(Hoffman laughs)
iuL1NTNGMA8,1474440,1477259,- I also don't have Netflix.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1477260,1480010,"Could I use the company Netflix, please?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1480010,1481540,- Wow.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1481540,1483450,- I'll log out after I'm done with it.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1483450,1484283,- Uh-huh.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1485400,1488670,"I gotta say, one thing that's trippin' me out a little bit."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1488670,1490653,"Aside from your crooked ass TV,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1491490,1494240,is that our sound is over there.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1494240,1495073,- Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1495073,1496980,"- That wouldn't bother you, though?"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1496980,1498910,- I'd probably play it through the TV.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1498910,1503360,- So with the choice between great quality audio
iuL1NTNGMA8,1503360,1507030,that's coming from the wrong place or atrocious audio
iuL1NTNGMA8,1507030,1508190,"that's coming from the right place,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1508190,1510722,you take the bad audio from the right direction?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1511810,1512740,It's a tough call.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1512740,1515619,I'm not saying there's a right answer here.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1515619,1517620,"- I don't know what to do, Linus."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1517620,1520270,"But I think in this situation, we can go with the TV."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1521430,1522610,"Oh, never mind."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1522610,1524398,"- Yeah, so I don't think you can do it!"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1524399,1525560,(Hoffman laughs) Right?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1525560,1526970,- Yeah!
iuL1NTNGMA8,1526970,1528630,I feel like the theater's over there
iuL1NTNGMA8,1528630,1530460,but I'm watching from here. - Yeah.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1530460,1531860,"- That's all right, though."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1531860,1532890,- Happy with the setup?
iuL1NTNGMA8,1532890,1533893,- Super happy.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1534940,1536879,"- You know what, I could get used to this bed."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1536880,1540240,"Just like I could get used to saying, ""Hey, thanks, Intel!"""
iuL1NTNGMA8,1540240,1543550,"Another Extreme Tech Upgrade is wrapped up,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1543550,1544790,we've got more coming.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1544790,1546960,"If you guys enjoyed Hoffman's tech upgrade,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1546960,1547793,where we figured--
iuL1NTNGMA8,1547793,1550530,"Man, you got new gaming slash editing machine,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1550530,1555500,"sick audio setup, upgraded NAS, freaking TV."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1555500,1557010,"You really know how to stretch your dollar,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1557010,1558060,I gotta give you that.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1558060,1558893,- Took me a while.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1558893,1559809,"- If you enjoyed this one,"
iuL1NTNGMA8,1559810,1561600,go check out some of our previous ones.
iuL1NTNGMA8,1561600,1565330,"We broke Andy's bed, Dennis wasted his money."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1565330,1567841,"- Oh, and you in a girl's room for the first time."
iuL1NTNGMA8,1567842,1570283,(upbeat music) - That's such a cringe title.
