e94zWmu58ZY,1169600,1175120,biscuit some bread with some jam and  some cheese on top yeah and this is like  a biscuit with coconut on top what kind
e94zWmu58ZY,1175120,1182160,of coconut we call it coquito what they  do is like they boil coconut sugar  cinnamon for a half an hour until that
e94zWmu58ZY,1182160,1189120,everything evaporates and this is the  result what's that ah it's a coconut and  cinnamon reduction or amplification
e94zWmu58ZY,1189120,1196400,depending how you  let's try that oh  [Music]
e94zWmu58ZY,1196400,1202559,i like it it takes some getting used to  it's kind of a dry biscuit and it's like  okay oh no there's some jam on there and  then you're like wait is that cheese

e94zWmu58ZY,1207760,1214880,thoughts i'm looking at your face i  still like it that more yeah but what  are your thoughts on that i like this i  love that it's not all my love when you

e94zWmu58ZY,1220400,1225419,i got that treatment a lot in high  school  [Laughter]
e94zWmu58ZY,1225440,1230640,just down the street a fruit cart has  caught my eyeballs do not tell me this  is an avocado
e94zWmu58ZY,1230640,1235840,are you kidding me please look at this  i've never seen an avocado this is an  avocado yeah i think i remember you
e94zWmu58ZY,1235840,1242799,telling me a long time ago yes like we  have avocados this big like a watermelon  you were like no not possible yes okay

e94zWmu58ZY,1248159,1253280,like rotate okay i can handle this yeah  you got it look at that you got it and  it's all the way up
e94zWmu58ZY,1253280,1259760,skin you see  we got it you see how long  it looks like grapefruit texture inside
e94zWmu58ZY,1259760,1266400,no we gotta taste it  oh it's good it's sour but it's good it
e94zWmu58ZY,1266400,1272559,tastes like an orange actually orange  used to be bigger here in cuba we used  to produce a lot of orange right now i
e94zWmu58ZY,1272559,1278000,think the production came down and the  quality also came down a lot because the  land hasn't been taken care of as well
e94zWmu58ZY,1278000,1283520,as before that's why we don't have  better quality of orange but there was a  time that this was very important part
e94zWmu58ZY,1283520,1290320,of the cuban economy oh it's good it was  succinct it was a little sad too that's  cute  that's reality yeah contrast to bring me
e94zWmu58ZY,1290320,1295600,up from oro's sad fruit trivia a much  needed sugar rush cuban sidewalk churros
e94zWmu58ZY,1295600,1303640,at churros locos the most local stall  you'll find in all of havana this is  churro evolution
e94zWmu58ZY,1304730,1308989,[Music]
e94zWmu58ZY,1310880,1319120,check it out man we're just standing on  the street eating a churro you know  about churros right yeah invented in  cuba no no mexico no it comes from spain
e94zWmu58ZY,1319120,1325840,cuba has a lot of spanish tradition  that's why we didn't harry the churros  in our culture as well cheers cheers it
e94zWmu58ZY,1325840,1333320,looks like a cactus isn't it maybe  that's why people think it's from mexico  because it looks like a cactus
e94zWmu58ZY,1333679,1339200,that's a good churro it's a good churros  i like that like me it has some  imperfections like some parts are fat
e94zWmu58ZY,1339200,1344880,some are thin and crispy do you notice  what is desire of the sugars the  condensed milk condensed milk you know i
e94zWmu58ZY,1344880,1351360,love condensation yeah it's super sweet  it's really sweet in this case they put  inside of the churro which is good  mixture they're building on what the
e94zWmu58ZY,1351360,1359080,spaniards started originally it wasn't  stuff you see  evolution i love it
e94zWmu58ZY,1360880,1368159,now one of the most unlikely non-cuban  cuban foods you'll find in havana dude  this is a pizza it's a real pizza pizza
e94zWmu58ZY,1368159,1373280,shops are everywhere in havana and with  good reason every single street food  that we met they have something in
e94zWmu58ZY,1373280,1380080,common they have really few elements  food shortages are not uncommon here 70  to 90 percent of the country's food is
e94zWmu58ZY,1380080,1387360,imported after the 60 when we have a  huge crisis we have to create food that  is simple easy to make and really hard
e94zWmu58ZY,1387360,1393679,to get wrong so if you're selling ham  sandwiches and you run out of ham you're  out of luck but pizza pizza only really
e94zWmu58ZY,1393679,1399679,requires four ingredients water flour  tomato sauce and cheese
e94zWmu58ZY,1399679,1404720,every cuban pizza is a personal pizza  made for you and only you toppings range
e94zWmu58ZY,1404720,1412320,from ham to sausage or even hot dogs but  the way they eat it is a style all its  own you flip it like this like a taco
e94zWmu58ZY,1412320,1418960,exactly let's go for it  it's rich it's super doughy i love how
e94zWmu58ZY,1418960,1425360,doughy it is is that hot sauce it's just  covered in like a sour hot sauce sour  tomato sauce yeah yeah this is good dude
e94zWmu58ZY,1425360,1430480,actually this is something that people  eat at eight in the morning it's just  quick easy and you get filled and get
e94zWmu58ZY,1430480,1435390,going very nice  [Music]
e94zWmu58ZY,1439600,1446559,this is where havana goes to chill on  weekends john lennon park in the corner  a government ordered statue created in
e94zWmu58ZY,1446559,1452159,his honor in the year 2000  this is kind of baffling considering the
e94zWmu58ZY,1452159,1458400,beatles music was banned in cuba when  the band was most popular a decade prior
e94zWmu58ZY,1458400,1465360,these days a more culturally liberal  cuba blasts music of all kinds from this  park luring in locals who might throw
e94zWmu58ZY,1465360,1469960,back a drink or grab some food
e94zWmu58ZY,1476080,1482720,what do we have right here so right here  we have ancon croqueta which means pan  is bread croquetta it comes from french
e94zWmu58ZY,1482720,1488080,from crockett that's the croquette right  it's like seasoned fried mashed potatoes  basically that's very nice and then this
e94zWmu58ZY,1488080,1494960,is the same thing but in a sandwich yeah  the same thing due to its simplicity and  practicality it can fill a lot of space
e94zWmu58ZY,1494960,1501200,this used to be cuba's go-to sandwich  especially in the 90s bread fried  croquette and a little bit of ketchup
e94zWmu58ZY,1501200,1507520,that's all you need here for a good time  in your mouth  i like it there's not much to say about
e94zWmu58ZY,1507520,1514080,it it's simple straightforward soft  bread fried potato a little bit of  ketchup in there a little bit of tomato  kick at the end it's not potato it's
e94zWmu58ZY,1514080,1520000,made out of flour meat potato not potato  it tastes potato way to me
e94zWmu58ZY,1520000,1528278,i'm so sorry but man this is filling it  is filling all right let's get some  beers i saw someone with beer over there  let's check that out
e94zWmu58ZY,1528410,1534240,[Music]
e94zWmu58ZY,1534240,1539520,until just a few years ago private  restaurants in cuba were illegal
e94zWmu58ZY,1539520,1545360,then due to an economic crisis the  government made some reforms
e94zWmu58ZY,1546320,1552880,and that's how polidars were born they  are family or privately owned  restaurants originally they were run
e94zWmu58ZY,1552880,1559120,from people's homes and many still are  today  like here hidden away in the suburbs of
e94zWmu58ZY,1559120,1566480,havana right in front of the polidar  owner's home her home is right there  sits cafeteria a la barbecue a place
e94zWmu58ZY,1566480,1571760,where filmmakers and artists share ideas  and grab some grub this is cuban diner
e94zWmu58ZY,1571760,1578480,food served fast making the most of what  they have  like their hamburger pan
e94zWmu58ZY,1578480,1584159,bread with hamburger since beef is  scarce  their burger patty is made with pork i'm
e94zWmu58ZY,1584159,1590559,gonna try that right now  [Applause]  i like it a lot i don't know if i've  ever had like a pork patty for a burger
e94zWmu58ZY,1590559,1596400,but it's really good very juicy this  seems like cuban fast food yeah but with  good quality can she talk about how she
e94zWmu58ZY,1596400,1602400,prepares for the service  what is how she prepares her team to act
e94zWmu58ZY,1602400,1608480,fast everything is prepared today  because her goal is to keep everything  fresh right what do you got there what i
e94zWmu58ZY,1608480,1614000,have here we call masas de puerto this  dish epitomizes cuban cuisine at least
e94zWmu58ZY,1614000,1620480,in oro's eyes this is something that my  mom used to make when i was a kid simple  yet colorful and seductive
e94zWmu58ZY,1620480,1625520,a huge portion of rice grilled pork  chops and in season locally grown
e94zWmu58ZY,1625520,1632400,veggies and sides this is a pork chop  and you know usually pork chop to me can  be a little dry but this is so good
e94zWmu58ZY,1632400,1637760,actually yeah but the way they make it  here is super oily but she has a balance
e94zWmu58ZY,1637760,1643440,between that making not too dry but i  feel not too oily which i love to finish
e94zWmu58ZY,1643440,1650080,dessert made inside a reused soda can  right here the thing that you're  drinking here they got it they put all
e94zWmu58ZY,1650080,1656720,the ingredients they boil it when they  cool down it becomes that thing that  you're eating right there
e94zWmu58ZY,1656720,1662799,that's really good very sweet and  velvety soft on my tongue perfect way to  end lunch
e94zWmu58ZY,1665919,1671600,cuba is a place of creation expression  and fierce entrepreneurship waiting to
e94zWmu58ZY,1671600,1677039,unleash its innovation  in this city one hardly known polidar is
e94zWmu58ZY,1677039,1683760,delivering seafood in a way completely  unique to cuba check it out we're doing  an interview in an inconvenient location

e94zWmu58ZY,1701279,1706960,into a restaurant because you can see it  has a beautiful view my understanding is  that this is how the paladar started yes
e94zWmu58ZY,1706960,1712720,right now there is people owning  restaurants but back then that was  impossible so the first step was that
e94zWmu58ZY,1712720,1718640,family owned concert it was like a test  can you tell me about what makes your  restaurant so special
e94zWmu58ZY,1718640,1725279,that when we get into the home we don't  feel like we are getting to a restaurant  he's inviting us to his house he just

e94zWmu58ZY,1755600,1761679,or has local fishermen do the deed  reeling in fresh fish like this tuna
e94zWmu58ZY,1761679,1768480,his daughter and also our head chef  mashes it up then combines it with  onions and mayonnaise to create a

e94zWmu58ZY,1848640,1855679,since but with his own twist he's  replaced unavailable ingredients like  spanish ham with seafood he caught in
e94zWmu58ZY,1855679,1862720,his backyard  they cook it all in a big pot with a  secret blend of spices garbanzo beans
e94zWmu58ZY,1862720,1869600,beer tomato sauce and garlic paste okay  hold on i guess it's not really secret  after all

e94zWmu58ZY,1941519,1947200,adapt and overcome  this is the ethos felt around havana
e94zWmu58ZY,1947200,1953760,from pizza to five-star seafood what  really makes cuba work isn't the  ingredients
e94zWmu58ZY,1953760,1959600,it's heart  [Music]  today we're leaving the country's
e94zWmu58ZY,1959600,1967519,capital havana and heading east to the  city of  um  the city of
e94zWmu58ZY,1967679,1974240,cochino's playa larga  it's not that hard to say here we're  taking on a food rare even in cuba you
e94zWmu58ZY,1974240,1979600,cannot try this dish anywhere else it's  not even allowed but there's one small  problem
e94zWmu58ZY,1979600,1985919,before we can take a bite we have to  catch our dinner we all know and hope it  doesn't take a bite out of us oh no
e94zWmu58ZY,1985919,1992320,there's another one behind it first my  plan is to see if we can kind of work  around their usual rules and
e94zWmu58ZY,1992320,1998880,restrictions and have oro catch a  crocodile  [Music]  crocodile
e94zWmu58ZY,1998880,2005559,no  why do you mean crocodile i touch them  like be cloned

e94zWmu58ZY,2020960,2028240,in cuba business owners and locals wake  up early to pick up fresh ingredients  from small local markets like this
e94zWmu58ZY,2028240,2034159,today we accompany crocodile cooking  specialist alexis we are with the  crocodile cooker himself what is your
e94zWmu58ZY,2034159,2041360,full-time role is that all you do is  cook crocodiles no no no he's more like  a seafood cook but crocodile is one of
e94zWmu58ZY,2041360,2049599,his specialities at his restaurant he'll  be whipping up a one-of-a-kind crocodile  spread how do you say crocodile coco
e94zWmu58ZY,2049839,2057118,is it cocodrilo seafood  he said that he has three flavors before  cooking he can taste like chicken or
e94zWmu58ZY,2057118,2063679,pork but after cooking it tastes more  like fish so he's tasted it raw no it's  not recommended he's like nobody does
e94zWmu58ZY,2063679,2070079,that but i i do it  [Music]
e94zWmu58ZY,2070079,2076158,right now we're off to a crocodile farm  where he's gonna actually catch a  crocodile hold on a second me or we i
e94zWmu58ZY,2076158,2081839,need to like tell the camera guys what  to do i hear that from you before why  you don't do it because i'm too fat when
e94zWmu58ZY,2081839,2088960,we weren't trying to jump no i don't  wanna do it man jump  oh bunchy chumps
e94zWmu58ZY,2088960,2095679,yeah four years ago oro and i made a  concept for a show called the year of  fear i encouraged oro to bungee jump
e94zWmu58ZY,2095679,2100880,which he wasn't happy about  unfortunately i wasn't allowed to bungee  jump because i surpassed the weight
e94zWmu58ZY,2100880,2105920,limit man now i'm encouraging oro to  catch a giant reptile which he's also
e94zWmu58ZY,2105920,2113560,not happy about did you tell him that  you're going to catch it  in position
e94zWmu58ZY,2117119,2123040,right now he's just cutting right  through oro's hopes and dreams crushing  his spirit  you hate to see it folks you hate to see
e94zWmu58ZY,2123040,2128720,it can you translate that he's like no  way you can catch that only people who  has born here can do it it's very
e94zWmu58ZY,2128720,2134320,dangerous but he can try what's the  worst that can happen  thank you we'll be back you'll see all
e94zWmu58ZY,2134320,2140160,of me and you might only see part of oro  i can see alexis has shaken oro's
e94zWmu58ZY,2140160,2146400,confidence so before we go face to face  with the crocodiles oro and i are going  to carve up at a back alley factory
e94zWmu58ZY,2146400,2152960,where they're kicking out one of cuba's  most unique foods i brought you to a  place where they produce cassave cassave
e94zWmu58ZY,2152960,2159200,yeah casabe is the most authentic cuban  food that we conserve today casabe is
e94zWmu58ZY,2159200,2165119,cuban flatbread a staple dish in this  region inherited straight from the  indigenous arawak people it played a

e94zWmu58ZY,2194800,2201520,eating like some kind of cereal that you  would mix with milk and sugar obviously  not really any flavor because this is  just an ingredient for something more i
e94zWmu58ZY,2201520,2208070,think you are not extracting your  palette because i can feel flavors let's  take another bite and let's dip into it
e94zWmu58ZY,2208070,2214000,[Music]  very airy  very light  and it seems like perfect for soaking up
e94zWmu58ZY,2214000,2220320,some sauce and some other flavors  actually this is made to be in company  all the flavors yeah i don't think about
e94zWmu58ZY,2220320,2225839,that we are like timon improvement you  know timon and pumbaa yeah i've heard we  are like that i just repeat what you say

e94zWmu58ZY,2363520,2370560,use all the money for conservation of  course this is super expensive to have  like 4 000 crocodiles and they're not  eating corn they're eating like
e94zWmu58ZY,2370560,2377680,meat  yeah  but before we catch the crocodile we  must understand the crocodile so at the

e94zWmu58ZY,2438480,2445280,talk to build courage i may have a  history of pushing oro into situations  he's not totally comfortable with holy
e94zWmu58ZY,2445280,2450800,no i don't want other women but that's  because oro is my brother and that's  what brothers do they push each other if

e94zWmu58ZY,2578480,2585520,first punta punta crocodile tail steak  tips with veggies now right away before  he puts it on it smells fishy but as he
e94zWmu58ZY,2585520,2590839,cooks it's changing the smell it becomes  what more porky more chickeny more

e94zWmu58ZY,2626800,2634079,i'm going to try this right here if you  just gave this to me i would say this is  a big pork chop yeah apparently it looks  a little bit like pork with a big fish
e94zWmu58ZY,2634079,2637599,texture i'm going to try it out right  now
e94zWmu58ZY,2639119,2644880,this one is closer to chicken but not  exactly it's like it's a whole new  texture it's a texture that's kind of
e94zWmu58ZY,2644880,2651440,between chicken and fish is it cheese  it's a dish  next enchilada
e94zWmu58ZY,2651440,2657440,starting with their in-house tomato  chili sauce then the crocs neck and  thymine season with black pepper and
e94zWmu58ZY,2657440,2662950,simmered until cooked through  finished with the greens and veggies  from the market this morning

e94zWmu58ZY,2671440,2677920,if you didn't know that this is  crocodile would you say that this is  three different meats yeah i would say  that pork chop that might be some kind
e94zWmu58ZY,2677920,2685520,of fish and that might be chicken it's  all over the place actually after  chewing it it gives me a little bit of  potato flavor so it can be the potato of
e94zWmu58ZY,2685520,2691000,the seed or the potato of the swamp  right
e94zWmu58ZY,2691040,2696720,how long have you had this restaurant  seven years he crushed it yeah  oh i'm really impressed sure you killed

e94zWmu58ZY,2727200,2732319,surrounded by mountains is a side of  cuba few outsiders have seen before it
e94zWmu58ZY,2732319,2739040,has a completely different feeling from  the metropolitan vibes that you get from  havana coming out here it's countryside
e94zWmu58ZY,2739040,2744400,a land that gave birth to a lot of our  culture
e94zWmu58ZY,2745599,2752480,unlike cuba's more temperate west coast  ideal for growing tobacco and coffee  varacoa is bringing the tropical heat
e94zWmu58ZY,2752480,2758000,cacao  not being used for chocolate but used as  an ingredient to season other more
e94zWmu58ZY,2758000,2763200,savory dishes there is a fish that they  cook with the cat
e94zWmu58ZY,2766000,2771838,today is all about the fiesta oh is that  a pig it's like a pig pet

e94zWmu58ZY,2847760,2853280,the only way to get him here through  these kind of rocky roads this uneven  path was to put him on a horse on our

e94zWmu58ZY,2860800,2868079,hard-working dude to get to his home you  can take the arduous journey through  rocks mud and water by foot or you can

e94zWmu58ZY,2873760,2881040,sugarcane your specialty here his  speciality is more like agriculture but  cacao is like the biggest food on this
e94zWmu58ZY,2881040,2886160,area  [Music]  cuba used to be a sugar cane heaven
e94zWmu58ZY,2886160,2892559,once the biggest exporter in the world  until trade stopped with the us then  later subsidies from the soviet union
e94zWmu58ZY,2892559,2899440,stopped coming in around the early 90s  sugar prices crashed  nonetheless acel still continues a small
e94zWmu58ZY,2899440,2907200,operation here on his farm in other  places there's more sugarcane factory  but here what he has is a trapeze
e94zWmu58ZY,2907200,2912570,[Music]
e94zWmu58ZY,2912570,2919359,[Applause]  [Music]  this trapeze egg is from france but
e94zWmu58ZY,2919359,2926720,actually trapeze in general was  introduced to cuba by spanish people and  it was a way to generate serum out of
e94zWmu58ZY,2926720,2932400,the sugarcane and they use that for the  cacao for the chocolate alcohol also  comes from there ah
e94zWmu58ZY,2932400,2937599,this is basically the origin story of  for rum can you believe um he's an
e94zWmu58ZY,2937599,2942319,actual cuban he's never had rum no
e94zWmu58ZY,2943839,2950559,he doesn't drink that much either oh all  right that's not what i was looking for  after extracting the juice it's filtered
e94zWmu58ZY,2950559,2958240,to remove any unwanted bits cool it up  with a bit of ice and we're ready to  kick this refreshing drink back
e94zWmu58ZY,2958480,2965040,how often do you drink this  almost every day because he works in the  countryside he needs a way to hydrate
e94zWmu58ZY,2965040,2970160,himself in this case this is called  guarapo all right let's try it out
e94zWmu58ZY,2970160,2975280,oh yeah it's kind of thick you know it's  sweet but it's also a little bit earthy  i didn't expect that it's really good
e94zWmu58ZY,2975280,2981200,actually i used to love this when i was  a kid drinking with a lot of ice and  it's super refreshing sugarcane is no
e94zWmu58ZY,2981200,2987280,longer the golden crop it once was to  the point that cuba now imports sugar  from other countries
e94zWmu58ZY,2987280,2992400,still sugarcane is an important part of  cuban agriculture and an icon like cuban
e94zWmu58ZY,2992400,2998559,coffee and cuban tobacco  now with a belly full of fresh sugar
e94zWmu58ZY,2998559,3003759,cane juice oro and i are finally headed  to barucoa

e94zWmu58ZY,3074880,3083160,after they've turned red right here you  can see the bud would you call this a  buddha de cacao pero lo casino
e94zWmu58ZY,3086720,3094000,it takes five years for a cacao tree to  produce its first seed pods and you need  ten pots like this to make one pound of
e94zWmu58ZY,3094000,3100400,cocoa or is it cacao i don't know  eventually it's going to be chocolate  and that's what really matters here
e94zWmu58ZY,3100400,3105680,she chops the pod in half revealing tons  of cocoa seeds inside seeds get removed
e94zWmu58ZY,3105680,3111839,and placed on a bed of banana leaves  where they ferment for 11 days when the  moment is right it's time for these
e94zWmu58ZY,3111839,3117599,beans to roast cacao when it's very raw  it's very good for the heart to give you
e94zWmu58ZY,3117599,3123440,natural energy when the cacao has a lot  of bitterness it's very good for the  blood pressure it's super good i'm

e94zWmu58ZY,3151760,3158079,hints of chocolate like okay i can see  how that would taste like chocolate  eventually maybe i'm wrong it also  tastes a little bit like coffee that
e94zWmu58ZY,3158079,3164720,kind of roasted yeah nutty flavor the  chorote starts with water then freshly  ground cacao powder cinnamon leaf milk
e94zWmu58ZY,3164720,3171260,powder banana flour and sugar mixing and  boiling until it's ready and eso

e94zWmu58ZY,4075920,4082720,private business up yeah we come here  and decide to open our own cafe  the cuba of today is a lot different
e94zWmu58ZY,4082720,4088559,than the cuba of a couple decades ago  when government-owned and operated  restaurants was the norm there was a lot
e94zWmu58ZY,4088559,4095760,of restrictions in the beginning so the  possibilities for owners to own their  own businesses it took a long time of
e94zWmu58ZY,4095760,4102719,course in a government-owned restaurant  with no owner with no vision there was  also no incentive for workers to perform
e94zWmu58ZY,4102719,4109040,at a high level  these days as the government relaxes  more regulations more and more private
e94zWmu58ZY,4109040,4115838,business owners are stepping up and when  you're pouring your heart and soul into  your own company the quality shows
e94zWmu58ZY,4115838,4123040,dude do you call omelets tortillas  yes  really where does that come from spain
e94zWmu58ZY,4123040,4128159,i've seen a lot of things in the omelet  never banana in cuba there is a big
e94zWmu58ZY,4128159,4133679,relationship between banana and kids  moms used to put bananas on the omelette
e94zWmu58ZY,4133679,4139838,to give it a little bit of sweet flavor  and sometimes they even sprinkle sugar
e94zWmu58ZY,4139838,4147400,on top of it like this did you  experience that too yeah sorry i need to  check if this is
e94zWmu58ZY,4147600,4154238,it's weird but i don't hate it it's  something very unique you're an  entrepreneur you had an idea and it  worked i'm sure you've built momentum
e94zWmu58ZY,4154238,4159679,over time but right now what are the  challenges for entrepreneurs in cuba
e94zWmu58ZY,4159679,4165520,the supply the supply so you need to  work for one two hours all day shop
e94zWmu58ZY,4165520,4171120,around the area to get just butter or  milk  being a restaurant owner in any part of
e94zWmu58ZY,4171120,4176560,the world is an unenviable challenge in  cuba  even more so
e94zWmu58ZY,4176560,4182238,she has an idea of the whole day she  prepared everything for the menu and  when she's running out of resources she
e94zWmu58ZY,4182238,4188400,started to wipe out every piece of  element that she doesn't have until she  run out of everything restaurants in
e94zWmu58ZY,4188400,4194880,general can have hundreds of items they  need to stock regularly from  distributors cooking oil dish soap meat
e94zWmu58ZY,4194880,4202080,napkins receipt paper  in cuba breakdowns in this supply chain
e94zWmu58ZY,4202080,4208400,are still common so even something we  may take for granted like butter may be  easily found today and nowhere to be
e94zWmu58ZY,4208400,4215600,found  tomorrow  meet lizzy born and raised in cuba but
e94zWmu58ZY,4215600,4221679,she lived in italy for 14 years she  returned to cuba and opened this  restaurant two and a half years ago
e94zWmu58ZY,4221679,4226800,bringing her italian experience and  fusing it with cuban flavors and  ingredients what are the most
e94zWmu58ZY,4226800,4234320,challenging ingredients for you to find  first of all she has a mother
e94zWmu58ZY,4234320,4240800,spirit  so she brought that spirit to the  restaurant  where she needs to think ahead because
e94zWmu58ZY,4240800,4247199,your kids if they don't have anything to  eat you can be like oh i'm sorry no you  need to feed right as a mom so that's
e94zWmu58ZY,4247199,4252480,why she choose to make it simple not  just for the palette of people but also
e94zWmu58ZY,4252480,4258560,for her to find ingredients  the case of finding ingredients in
e94zWmu58ZY,4258560,4264880,season especially like cheese because  she uses mozzarella cheese it can be  hard to find or can just disappear but
e94zWmu58ZY,4264880,4270560,she found a local supplier that made it  so they don't rely on the government to
e94zWmu58ZY,4270560,4276000,create that they relay in the  connections that they make with each  other that's what keeps business like
e94zWmu58ZY,4276000,4283760,this alive wow  lizzy is serving up one of her favorite  creations pico la escuena it's basically
e94zWmu58ZY,4283760,4289840,a cuban calzone placed cheese rope vieja  a mix of beef and pork then fried sweet
e94zWmu58ZY,4289840,4296320,plantain in the middle of their homemade  pizza dough fold it in half edge it up  and they put it in their homemade oven
e94zWmu58ZY,4296320,4304320,where do you get a pizza oven like this  she said that this is custom made by  different locals
e94zWmu58ZY,4305679,4313120,in the u.s if you need a commercial  pizza oven you just go online find a  distributor and order one
e94zWmu58ZY,4313120,4318159,in cuba you hire a welder an engineer  and a plumber to work together and make

e94zWmu58ZY,4790320,4797520,in just seven days we drove across the  entirety of this country and back to its  capital a week is hardly enough time to
e94zWmu58ZY,4797520,4802880,know a place well but still i can say  what cuba means to me
e94zWmu58ZY,4802880,4808080,cuba is struggle  cuba is overcoming

e94zWmu58ZY,4819920,4826400,really don't know but  the only thing i can say is we need to  be flexible and try to do something
e94zWmu58ZY,4826400,4833040,different with everything that you can  get here in cuba where does that come  from that idea of like keep fighting
e94zWmu58ZY,4833040,4839840,find a different way be resourceful  cubans are not from here we have to come  here and adapt to the island sometimes
e94zWmu58ZY,4839840,4847920,we don't notice because it's become that  survival like if you stop doing it you  die so that kind of survival has set the
e94zWmu58ZY,4847920,4852960,path of where we are right now and for  your other question they may not know
e94zWmu58ZY,4852960,4859679,what the  future of entrepreneur is right now in  the country but for sure the future of
e94zWmu58ZY,4859679,4866239,the country is in the entrepreneurs  because i think more than qualities more  than cultural and everything they are
e94zWmu58ZY,4866239,4871040,shaping what can be the future of this  country
