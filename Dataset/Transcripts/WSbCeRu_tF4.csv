WSbCeRu_tF4,20000,22480,in depth
WSbCeRu_tF4,24240,25840,so
WSbCeRu_tF4,25840,28560,primarily what equal education is taking
WSbCeRu_tF4,28560,30720,issue with is the what you've pointed
WSbCeRu_tF4,30720,31439,out
WSbCeRu_tF4,31439,32160,a
WSbCeRu_tF4,32160,35120,battle that has been waged over many
WSbCeRu_tF4,35120,37520,years almost 10 years equal education
WSbCeRu_tF4,37520,39840,has been back and forth in court with
WSbCeRu_tF4,39840,41280,the minister
WSbCeRu_tF4,41280,44079,insisting on these deadlines to bring
WSbCeRu_tF4,44079,46079,infrastructure across south african
WSbCeRu_tF4,46079,47039,schools
WSbCeRu_tF4,47039,48800,to a minimal
WSbCeRu_tF4,48800,51760,minimum acceptable standards as we know
WSbCeRu_tF4,51760,53920,perhaps not in this province as much
WSbCeRu_tF4,53920,55680,where i am right now but certainly
WSbCeRu_tF4,55680,57760,across the country there are so many
WSbCeRu_tF4,57760,60559,schools that are just not
WSbCeRu_tF4,60559,63600,fit for learning to take place and what
WSbCeRu_tF4,63600,65280,they're really taking issue with right
WSbCeRu_tF4,65280,68400,now is um main planned
WSbCeRu_tF4,68400,70640,amendments to regulations to the norms
WSbCeRu_tF4,70640,72080,and standards which were published in
WSbCeRu_tF4,72080,74000,the government gazette which are open
WSbCeRu_tF4,74000,76400,for public comment but equal education
WSbCeRu_tF4,76400,78159,claiming that the minister has done this
WSbCeRu_tF4,78159,80640,very surreptitiously and that she is
WSbCeRu_tF4,80640,83600,planning to remove deadlines that have
WSbCeRu_tF4,83600,86799,been set uh that will
WSbCeRu_tF4,86799,90640,force her to make sure that schools meet
WSbCeRu_tF4,90640,91439,these
WSbCeRu_tF4,91439,93200,certain standards
WSbCeRu_tF4,93200,94159,by
WSbCeRu_tF4,94159,96640,different deadlines have been outlined
WSbCeRu_tF4,96640,99119,for various aspects of infrastructure
WSbCeRu_tF4,99119,102320,and so that is really the core of which
WSbCeRu_tF4,102320,104320,they are taking issue with but of course
WSbCeRu_tF4,104320,106560,they are a raft of amendments that are
WSbCeRu_tF4,106560,109840,being prepa being proposed but um
WSbCeRu_tF4,109840,111680,i want you to hear directly from one of

WSbCeRu_tF4,139680,141680,right for us and for the fact that he's
WSbCeRu_tF4,141680,144080,removing the deadlines we are we are not
WSbCeRu_tF4,144080,146720,as the as the ones on the ground on the
WSbCeRu_tF4,146720,148319,schools we know what's going on there on
WSbCeRu_tF4,148319,150080,the schools and the infrastructure is so
WSbCeRu_tF4,150080,153120,not right for us so how come when we did

WSbCeRu_tF4,162239,163680,our
WSbCeRu_tF4,163680,166080,support our head topic
WSbCeRu_tF4,166080,167840,yeah and buckley just tell me a little
WSbCeRu_tF4,167840,169440,bit about the school where that you
WSbCeRu_tF4,169440,171680,attend what is the infrastructure like
WSbCeRu_tF4,171680,173280,there and how does it impact your
WSbCeRu_tF4,173280,175519,learning you know it's very hectic it's
WSbCeRu_tF4,175519,179120,very hectic i mean we have a few few
WSbCeRu_tF4,179120,181360,few windows and a class is very filled
WSbCeRu_tF4,181360,184080,at the same time the equipment or the
WSbCeRu_tF4,184080,186159,resources are ain't enough for example
WSbCeRu_tF4,186159,188319,their doors are smashed and
WSbCeRu_tF4,188319,190720,we have so much so much so much going on
WSbCeRu_tF4,190720,193120,and it affects the rate of of the past
WSbCeRu_tF4,193120,194879,of in the schools we ain't actually
WSbCeRu_tF4,194879,196800,passing an
WSbCeRu_tF4,196800,198879,expected rate because we don't have the
WSbCeRu_tF4,198879,200560,resources and we're suffering the
WSbCeRu_tF4,200560,202239,infrastructure is very lame the pit
WSbCeRu_tF4,202239,204000,toilets not only in the western cape
WSbCeRu_tF4,204000,206239,also in other provinces easy
WSbCeRu_tF4,206239,208159,they're still using the p toilets and
WSbCeRu_tF4,208159,210080,though they are very negatively
WSbCeRu_tF4,210080,213040,affecting the students
WSbCeRu_tF4,213040,215440,what is your understanding of the
WSbCeRu_tF4,215440,216799,minister
WSbCeRu_tF4,216799,218159,wanting to
WSbCeRu_tF4,218159,220319,re-look at the deadlines to fix schools
WSbCeRu_tF4,220319,222000,do you what do you think is the reason
WSbCeRu_tF4,222000,224480,behind that
WSbCeRu_tF4,224480,227440,to even say now that the deadlines are
WSbCeRu_tF4,227440,229440,closed you are not
WSbCeRu_tF4,229440,231040,i think the minister doesn't want to be
WSbCeRu_tF4,231040,232560,accountable for
WSbCeRu_tF4,232560,234319,for
WSbCeRu_tF4,234319,236560,for the that you date doesn't want to be
WSbCeRu_tF4,236560,239200,accountable now that won't implement
WSbCeRu_tF4,239200,241439,she won't implement in time you want to
WSbCeRu_tF4,241439,243200,want to move the fault and ask your
WSbCeRu_tF4,243200,245680,students or the partakers of the school
WSbCeRu_tF4,245680,248560,when i want to remove them
WSbCeRu_tF4,248560,250159,yeah the minister doesn't want to be
WSbCeRu_tF4,250159,252000,accountable i think that's it
WSbCeRu_tF4,252000,254239,thank you very much brooklyn so that's
WSbCeRu_tF4,254239,256239,the understanding of learners here in
WSbCeRu_tF4,256239,258239,the western cape but uh they are
WSbCeRu_tF4,258239,260239,hard-pressed to make the point that this
WSbCeRu_tF4,260239,262400,is not just about them here in this
WSbCeRu_tF4,262400,264400,province where things might look a
WSbCeRu_tF4,264400,266720,little bit better even though not
WSbCeRu_tF4,266720,269199,meeting uh the acceptable standards
WSbCeRu_tF4,269199,271199,across the board but certainly this is a
WSbCeRu_tF4,271199,273199,fight that they are taking
WSbCeRu_tF4,273199,276400,up on behalf of students across south
WSbCeRu_tF4,276400,279120,africa particularly in provinces where
WSbCeRu_tF4,279120,281199,as you've heard as bukle said where they
WSbCeRu_tF4,281199,283360,still go to school having to use put
WSbCeRu_tF4,283360,285280,luteins where they are sitting in
WSbCeRu_tF4,285280,287680,overcrowded classrooms and sitting in
WSbCeRu_tF4,287680,289919,classrooms that are not made
WSbCeRu_tF4,289919,291280,from material
WSbCeRu_tF4,291280,293759,fit for learning to take place
WSbCeRu_tF4,293759,295040,okay lindsey we'll leave it there for
WSbCeRu_tF4,295040,297440,now thank you very much for that report
WSbCeRu_tF4,297440,301680,that's a reporter lindsay gentling and
