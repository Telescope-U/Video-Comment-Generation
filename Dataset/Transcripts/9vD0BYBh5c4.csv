9vD0BYBh5c4,2160,6399,"For centuries, this is what school for most kids looked like"
9vD0BYBh5c4,7160,10120,But in 2020 all that changed
9vD0BYBh5c4,11560,13040,The covid-19 pandemic...
9vD0BYBh5c4,13040,17279,...created the largest disruption to education in modern history
9vD0BYBh5c4,17480,20599,As teachers scrambled to get their classes online...
9vD0BYBh5c4,21000,24360,...and parents developed a new-found respect for their kids’ teachers
9vD0BYBh5c4,24360,26120,No that’s not a “T”!
9vD0BYBh5c4,26120,27080,That’s an “X”
9vD0BYBh5c4,27080,28840,No this is an “X”!
9vD0BYBh5c4,29120,31920,But out of the disruption has come a realisation...
9vD0BYBh5c4,31920,33760,...of technology’s potential…
9vD0BYBh5c4,34240,36720,...to transform one of the most important sectors...
9vD0BYBh5c4,36720,39080,...for the future of the world
9vD0BYBh5c4,44080,48040,Summer camp has long been a tradition for American kids
9vD0BYBh5c4,48040,50440,Wholesome weeks away in nature...
9vD0BYBh5c4,50440,53360,...to focus on sports or science...
9vD0BYBh5c4,53360,54600,...or even space
9vD0BYBh5c4,55480,56720,This summer though...
9vD0BYBh5c4,56720,58480,...there’s a new camp
9vD0BYBh5c4,58480,60520,The covid catch-up camp...
9vD0BYBh5c4,60520,62760,...for students like these
9vD0BYBh5c4,64800,69000,"When the pandemic hit, their classes switched to online"
9vD0BYBh5c4,69000,70480,...which wasn’t easy
9vD0BYBh5c4,71360,75280,My pandemic school year was chaotic
9vD0BYBh5c4,75280,78560,"I could just like kind of do whatever I wanted because, like..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,78560,79920,...the teachers couldn’t see me
9vD0BYBh5c4,79920,84400,"So, like, I’ll be eating in class, sometimes falling asleep"
9vD0BYBh5c4,84400,86760,"You know I have to share, like, the living room with my sister..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,86760,88760,...and her class was extra loud
9vD0BYBh5c4,88760,90800,I did not like Zoom
9vD0BYBh5c4,92160,95640,Some schools in San Francisco were closed for in-person learning...
9vD0BYBh5c4,95640,97760,...for more than a year
9vD0BYBh5c4,97760,101160,And so the city decided to lay on extra  summer classes...
9vD0BYBh5c4,101160,103120,...for all public-school children
9vD0BYBh5c4,103120,107160,"Our children, particularly our very poor and low-income families..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,107160,110920,...all had a very difficult time with distance learning...
9vD0BYBh5c4,110920,114880,...not because they didn’t have the technology or the equipment...
9vD0BYBh5c4,114880,120119,...but because they didn’t have the support to stay engaged in distance learning...
9vD0BYBh5c4,120120,123720,...nor the structure at home to provide that support for them
9vD0BYBh5c4,123720,127120,And so as a result we very quickly came together...
9vD0BYBh5c4,127120,130160,...and created the Summer Together initiative
9vD0BYBh5c4,130160,132600,Last year was a year of loss...
9vD0BYBh5c4,132600,137800,...and this summer we were determined for this summer to be a year of recovery
9vD0BYBh5c4,142880,144960,By mid-April 2020...
9vD0BYBh5c4,144960,151520,...1.4bn students were out of school and university across 190 countries
9vD0BYBh5c4,151520,155960,By the start of 2021 schools had been wholly or partly closed...
9vD0BYBh5c4,155960,158320,...for about two-thirds of an academic year
9vD0BYBh5c4,159280,163040,While office workers transitioned to remote working fairly easily...
9vD0BYBh5c4,163040,165360,...it was a different story in schools
9vD0BYBh5c4,165960,169800,Tamara Gilkes Borr is The Economist’s US policy correspondent...
9vD0BYBh5c4,169800,171840,...but she used to be a teacher
9vD0BYBh5c4,171840,177080,When I heard that schools were shutting down with maybe a day of notice...
9vD0BYBh5c4,177080,181240,...I just couldn’t even imagine how I would have picked up the pieces so quickly...
9vD0BYBh5c4,181240,182560,...and continue to teach my students
9vD0BYBh5c4,183120,187360,We barely had enough working computers when I was a teacher
9vD0BYBh5c4,187920,191800,While new technologies transformed working life in many sectors...
9vD0BYBh5c4,191800,195200,...education has been notoriously slow to digitise
9vD0BYBh5c4,195200,198800,Classrooms today looked the same as they did decades ago
9vD0BYBh5c4,199040,202680,Even though parents often say that they want an innovative...
9vD0BYBh5c4,202680,204840,...new type of education for their children...
9vD0BYBh5c4,204840,206280,...when they walk into the classroom...
9vD0BYBh5c4,206280,211200,...they often want to see the things that they saw when they were children
9vD0BYBh5c4,211200,215440,So there’s often pushback against a new kind of education
9vD0BYBh5c4,215920,218280,And there was pushback from teachers too
9vD0BYBh5c4,218280,220880,Many of whom were sceptical about technology...
9vD0BYBh5c4,220880,223760,...that didn’t centre on face-to-face learning
9vD0BYBh5c4,223760,226080,"In general, education doesn’t change much..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,226080,228680,...because there’s a high cost to being wrong
9vD0BYBh5c4,228680,232319,Why change something up when the alternative could be so much worse?
9vD0BYBh5c4,233960,237520,But the pandemic sparked a techceleration in education...
9vD0BYBh5c4,237520,240000,...as schools rushed online
9vD0BYBh5c4,240000,245040,2.4m learners in America were given emergency internet access
9vD0BYBh5c4,245040,249439,The British government handed out more than 1m devices to students
9vD0BYBh5c4,249440,254400,Some schools even put Wi-Fi boosters on buses and drove them around towns
9vD0BYBh5c4,256840,260079,"As demand rocketed, the edtech sector responded..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,260079,264319,...designing apps and software to aid teachers rather than replace them
9vD0BYBh5c4,265280,269000,Once teachers had to suddenly become virtual...
9vD0BYBh5c4,269000,272880,...there was an appetite to get better technology in the classroom
9vD0BYBh5c4,272880,277840,And then edtech had an opportunity not only to serve those customers...
9vD0BYBh5c4,277840,281320,...but then they were able to get even better user data...
9vD0BYBh5c4,281320,284720,...and improve their products for a unique subset...
9vD0BYBh5c4,284720,286360,...which is teachers in the classroom
9vD0BYBh5c4,287920,292440,The amount of money spent on edtech globally is expected to double…
9vD0BYBh5c4,292440,299160,...from almost $200bn in 2019 to more than $400bn in 2025
9vD0BYBh5c4,302480,307240,"Okay, so today we are going to be focusing on maths..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,308200,311640,These students are getting a personalised-learning experience…
9vD0BYBh5c4,311640,314640,...thanks to an app on their laptops
9vD0BYBh5c4,315040,317280,The software is called Century
9vD0BYBh5c4,317280,322600,"It was created by Priya Lakhani, a former barrister turned tech entrepreneur"
9vD0BYBh5c4,322600,327120,So Century is a blend of artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology...
9vD0BYBh5c4,327120,329400,...with neuroscience and learning science
9vD0BYBh5c4,329400,333639,The idea is that it can personalise and differentiate for every student...
9vD0BYBh5c4,333640,335640,"...no matter what age, what course, what language"
9vD0BYBh5c4,336120,338240,And it can then use big data analytics...
9vD0BYBh5c4,338240,342880,"...and provide educators with instant insights, deep intervention insights..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,342880,345040,...as to what they need to do at the point of time...
9vD0BYBh5c4,345040,347720,...to help to increase a student’s outcome
9vD0BYBh5c4,350040,353560,"On a teacher dashboard, it will allow us to see the children..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,353560,356480,"...where they’re at, how many nuggets they’ve completed..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,356480,358280,...and their average score
9vD0BYBh5c4,358280,361080,"Once we‘ve done that, we can then go into it a bit deeper..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,361080,364159,...and find out what the nugget is they’re doing...
9vD0BYBh5c4,364160,366960,"...how they’ve done on it, what questions they’ve got right..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,366960,370360,"...where they’re struggling at, if they’ve skipped any questions "
9vD0BYBh5c4,370360,372960,So we can really analyse that data
9vD0BYBh5c4,374720,378120,Priya created Century as a way of addressing the problems she saw...
9vD0BYBh5c4,378120,380040,...in the education sector
9vD0BYBh5c4,380280,384000,We were still delivering a very one-size-fits all education
9vD0BYBh5c4,384000,387800,"Every child deserves a personalised, differentiated experience..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,387800,390560,"...but that’s really, really difficult, nearly impossible..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,390560,393040,...to provide in every educational setting
9vD0BYBh5c4,393040,397280,The second issue was that teachers spent more than half of their time...
9vD0BYBh5c4,397280,401440,"...60% of their time micro-marking, micro-assessing..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,401440,404440, ...trying to do the admin that was related to the children...
9vD0BYBh5c4,404440,407480,...and not actually spending most of the time teaching
9vD0BYBh5c4,407760,409960,"Before, we would have to spend hours and hours..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,409960,412160,...marking. We don’t have to do that now
9vD0BYBh5c4,412200,416120,"It shows us the data and we can see whether it’s green, amber, red..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,416120,418479,...we can see where the children are working at...
9vD0BYBh5c4,418480,421480,...and we can then pick up on those points to help the children
9vD0BYBh5c4,421880,424480,With children in Britain already spending on average...
9vD0BYBh5c4,424480,426840,...almost four hours a day online…
9vD0BYBh5c4,426840,430199,...some may worry about increased use of technology in the classroom…
9vD0BYBh5c4,430840,433919,...but Laurie Davis reckons it’s crucial
9vD0BYBh5c4,433920,439000,"Although all children have a laptop, we are not on it all day everyday"
9vD0BYBh5c4,439000,443280,We manage what we are doing and we implement it into our learning...
9vD0BYBh5c4,443280,445240,...in a blended-learning approach
9vD0BYBh5c4,445720,450960,"At the end of day, every job out there now is using some sort of computer"
9vD0BYBh5c4,450960,453560,So we need to lay those foundations...
9vD0BYBh5c4,453560,458639,And if that is how AI develops to give those children a better future...
9vD0BYBh5c4,458640,461640,...then I’m excited about that journey
9vD0BYBh5c4,465000,469960,Tech is also being used in an attempt to revolutionise how teachers teach
9vD0BYBh5c4,470400,473240,"So today, you are going to be talking with a group of five students..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,474360,478400,These trainees at the University of Virginia are practising their lessons...
9vD0BYBh5c4,478400,480000,...not on children...
9vD0BYBh5c4,480000,481480,...but on avatars
9vD0BYBh5c4,489240,492280,"When you’re a teacher, the first time is really high stakes"
9vD0BYBh5c4,492280,496080,You’re working with real kids and you don’t often get a second chance...
9vD0BYBh5c4,496080,498199,...to explain a complicated maths concept
9vD0BYBh5c4,498640,501240,And so what these simulations help us do...
9vD0BYBh5c4,501240,504800,...is give our beginning teachers the chance to actually practise that...
9vD0BYBh5c4,504800,507800,...and then do it again once they’ve gotten feedback
9vD0BYBh5c4,508240,512440,"I saw you use a lot of talk moves, in probing the students’ thinking..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,512440,515240,...and this is a pretty advanced kind of discussion skill
9vD0BYBh5c4,516400,519400,The software is designed by tech company Mursion
9vD0BYBh5c4,519919,524000,Behind the scenes a digital puppetmaster plays the role of the children
9vD0BYBh5c4,524320,525480,That’s a good question...
9vD0BYBh5c4,525480,528199,"...Um, you know what, I’m going to say Fruit Loops..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,528200,530560,...I’d eat Fruit Loops everyday
9vD0BYBh5c4,531600,534600,But the developers of the software hope that in future...
9vD0BYBh5c4,534600,537600,...the avatars can be programmed to think for themselves
9vD0BYBh5c4,541360,543560,The pandemic has also raised questions...
9vD0BYBh5c4,543560,547320,...about whether children need to be taught in a classroom at all
9vD0BYBh5c4,548000,550280,"For twins, Julia and Colin MeCey..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,550280,554880,...technology has helped give them an altogether different learning experience
9vD0BYBh5c4,555560,557920,They attend a virtual public school...
9vD0BYBh5c4,558400,560720,Are you taking British and world literature?
9vD0BYBh5c4,561440,564880,...which provides them with the equipment they need to learn remotely
9vD0BYBh5c4,565200,569200,"So I’m taking a fine arts course, so in my box I have..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,569720,576120,...clay and some paintbrushes and then some acrylic coloured paint
9vD0BYBh5c4,577800,581240,Julia moved to full-time remote-learning during the pandemic...
9vD0BYBh5c4,581240,586520," ...but Colin was a trailblazer, switching to e-education in 2019"
9vD0BYBh5c4,587200,592160,The environment of a one-on-one in comparison to one-on-30...
9vD0BYBh5c4,592160,593759,...is just a lot nicer
9vD0BYBh5c4,593760,596920,I have a lot more contact with my teachers and...
9vD0BYBh5c4,596920,599440,...the classes that are offered is just so much more...
9vD0BYBh5c4,599440,602240,...than what is offered at normal public school...
9vD0BYBh5c4,602240,603920,...like computer science for example
9vD0BYBh5c4,603920,607240,I’ve been able to take more classes that interest me
9vD0BYBh5c4,607240,609160,I think my grades have been better...
9vD0BYBh5c4,609160,613000,...so I probably will have a better chance of getting into my dream colleges
9vD0BYBh5c4,615680,618960,A recent survey found that nearly a third of American parents...
9vD0BYBh5c4,618960,623120, ...say it’s likely their child will continue with remote-learning indefinitely
9vD0BYBh5c4,623600,627880,It’s unclear to what extent fear of covid has influenced this decision
9vD0BYBh5c4,627880,630400,But roughly 20% of districts in America...
9vD0BYBh5c4,630400,634560,...are planning to offer some form of virtual learning even after the pandemic
9vD0BYBh5c4,635040,639079,We can all agree that most students do better when they’re in the classroom...
9vD0BYBh5c4,639080,643120,"...but for some students, having to do school remotely was a positive"
9vD0BYBh5c4,643600,644959,Some students have anxiety issues...
9vD0BYBh5c4,644960,648360,"...and it was easier to work from home, for example"
9vD0BYBh5c4,650920,654959,"For Dad, Mike, the technology also allows him to keep better tabs..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,654960,656800,...on his kids’ progress
9vD0BYBh5c4,657240,662080,Then you actually start on Wednesday normal classes?
9vD0BYBh5c4,662680,663720,During the pandemic...
9vD0BYBh5c4,663720,666839,...many teachers told me that this is the first time... 
9vD0BYBh5c4,666840,669440,...they’ve seen so much parent engagement
9vD0BYBh5c4,669440,674240,And a lot of that is because parents are home listening to the lessons...
9vD0BYBh5c4,674240,676520,...but also because they are engaging technology...
9vD0BYBh5c4,676520,679520,...that makes it easier for parents to be up to speed
9vD0BYBh5c4,680560,683560,Not all students can afford the space and internet connection...
9vD0BYBh5c4,683560,685640,...needed to study online...
9vD0BYBh5c4,685640,688120,...which means increased use of remote-learning...
9vD0BYBh5c4,688120,690600,...risks widening the digital divide
9vD0BYBh5c4,690600,693759,Ultimately the barrier to success for all edtech...
9vD0BYBh5c4,693760,696760,"...not just e-education, is financial"
9vD0BYBh5c4,697320,698880,For edtech to be successful...
9vD0BYBh5c4,698880,702440,...there needs to be investment in the schools that currently are under-resourced
9vD0BYBh5c4,703000,707240,There needs to be a push to make sure that these schools...
9vD0BYBh5c4,707240,710200,"...have the proper internet access, the facilities..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,710200,715360,...and everything else they need to be able to properly function with edtech
9vD0BYBh5c4,715360,717640,"If that doesn’t happen, then we will see..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,717640,721520, ...inequities develop in the classroom and across schools...
9vD0BYBh5c4,721880,724760,The technology that education deserves...
9vD0BYBh5c4,724760,728960,"...should be technology that is as advanced, if not more advanced..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,728960,731960,...than the technology that is applied to the banking sector
9vD0BYBh5c4,732240,735279,And if you want that sort of technology in the education sector...
9vD0BYBh5c4,735280,739680,...then you’re going to have to create a model that investors have an appetite for
9vD0BYBh5c4,740200,743640,The pandemic has made clear the vital role played by teachers
9vD0BYBh5c4,744400,747280,For many students the best place to learn is in the classroom
9vD0BYBh5c4,748400,753480,But technology can and will play a vital role in aiding education
9vD0BYBh5c4,754400,758160,Teachers are seeing the benefit of being able to have a hybrid classroom
9vD0BYBh5c4,758160,761839,"And most importantly, they’re seeing the skills their students are gaining..."
9vD0BYBh5c4,761840,763840,...that they wouldn’t have had otherwise...
9vD0BYBh5c4,763840,768720,...and these are skills that I think we all agree these students will need for the future
9vD0BYBh5c4,770320,774440,If you are interested in learning more about covid and education...
