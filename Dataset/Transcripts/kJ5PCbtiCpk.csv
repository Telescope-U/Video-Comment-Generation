kJ5PCbtiCpk,206870,209209,from a me cooking device right I need to
kJ5PCbtiCpk,209209,211040,make an enormous quantity of bechamel
kJ5PCbtiCpk,211040,213139,would it be unwise to make it in one go
kJ5PCbtiCpk,213139,215930,always try to maximize I'm keeping it
kJ5PCbtiCpk,215930,218389,together same thickness at the same
kJ5PCbtiCpk,218389,219709,amount of seasoning rather than several
kJ5PCbtiCpk,219709,222109,batches next question Daniela how'd you

kJ5PCbtiCpk,226879,228769,doesn't seem practical effect and a mac
kJ5PCbtiCpk,228769,230120,and cheese make sure you blanch the
kJ5PCbtiCpk,230120,232459,macaroni first two-thirds of the way and
kJ5PCbtiCpk,232459,234709,just allow one third to finish in the
kJ5PCbtiCpk,234709,238099,oven next oh no I have no horseradish to
kJ5PCbtiCpk,238099,240019,make my cocktail sauce what do I use now
kJ5PCbtiCpk,240019,243230,start of a cocktail sauce a touch of
kJ5PCbtiCpk,243230,245780,chili sauce and then this little baby
kJ5PCbtiCpk,245780,247819,here it's a Worcestershire sauce that
kJ5PCbtiCpk,247819,249319,will give it the spice you need so don't

kJ5PCbtiCpk,250629,253099,Glen just straining chicken stock
kJ5PCbtiCpk,253099,255849,through cloth help with skimming the fat
kJ5PCbtiCpk,255849,258620,no it doesn't it makes it cloudy the
kJ5PCbtiCpk,258620,260630,best thing to do on skimming of stock is
kJ5PCbtiCpk,260630,262350,to let it set
kJ5PCbtiCpk,262350,265050,and put a couple of ice cubes on top and
kJ5PCbtiCpk,265050,267600,it will bring the fat up and for me I
kJ5PCbtiCpk,267600,269820,get a slice of bread and I skim the top
kJ5PCbtiCpk,269820,271320,of my stop with a slice of bread that
kJ5PCbtiCpk,271320,273000,will absorb all the fat leaving that
kJ5PCbtiCpk,273000,274650,beautiful stock underneath how'd our
kJ5PCbtiCpk,274650,276300,cameras our cumberly without a cooking
kJ5PCbtiCpk,276300,276870,torch
kJ5PCbtiCpk,276870,279990,take an old spoon that you don't use put
kJ5PCbtiCpk,279990,281820,it on the gas flame get it really nice
kJ5PCbtiCpk,281820,284400,and hot and stick that lightly over the
kJ5PCbtiCpk,284400,286080,sugar and it will caramelize it
kJ5PCbtiCpk,286080,287700,instantly get it too hot then you'll
kJ5PCbtiCpk,287700,289830,destroy the cream Michael Gordon trying
kJ5PCbtiCpk,289830,291860,to decide between buying a Santa
kJ5PCbtiCpk,291860,295050,Japanese knife or general will show use
kJ5PCbtiCpk,295050,298020,for me the secret of a great knife is in
kJ5PCbtiCpk,298020,300240,the handle so when you find a knife has
kJ5PCbtiCpk,300240,301440,got the perfect handle it needs to be
kJ5PCbtiCpk,301440,304070,weighted Henkel for the knife's I use a
kJ5PCbtiCpk,304070,307140,great handle and a firm grip that's 90%
kJ5PCbtiCpk,307140,309090,of the work get comfortable with the
kJ5PCbtiCpk,309090,311220,handle it's the secret to great chopping
kJ5PCbtiCpk,311220,312420,Precure right I've never tried
kJ5PCbtiCpk,312420,314670,hollandaise sauce how do I know this is
kJ5PCbtiCpk,314670,317220,right so that looks like it's a great
kJ5PCbtiCpk,317220,317760,start
kJ5PCbtiCpk,317760,319770,if you airy ate it it can take so much
kJ5PCbtiCpk,319770,321270,butter if you don't lift up those egg
kJ5PCbtiCpk,321270,323850,yolks then it splits basically breaks so
kJ5PCbtiCpk,323850,326040,airy ate those eggs first and make sure
kJ5PCbtiCpk,326040,327750,that heat and the meat is not too hot a
kJ5PCbtiCpk,327750,329910,question from Steve G put too much salt
kJ5PCbtiCpk,329910,330900,in my bolognese sauce
kJ5PCbtiCpk,330900,332700,Robert ater will draw out the salt right
kJ5PCbtiCpk,332700,334590,no Steve it won't
kJ5PCbtiCpk,334590,336840,first of all take 1/3 of bolognaise out
kJ5PCbtiCpk,336840,339810,a touch of sugar and let it down with a
kJ5PCbtiCpk,339810,341580,touch of creme fraiche creme fraiche
kJ5PCbtiCpk,341580,343620,will lighten up the flavor and get rid
kJ5PCbtiCpk,343620,346770,of that salty taste Faye writes me
kJ5PCbtiCpk,346770,348810,internally trying to figure out how I
kJ5PCbtiCpk,348810,351120,would make a scotch egg do I use a
kJ5PCbtiCpk,351120,353400,hard-boiled egg or do I wrap it after
kJ5PCbtiCpk,353400,354360,with the sausage
kJ5PCbtiCpk,354360,357090,so the delicate part there try and make
kJ5PCbtiCpk,357090,359940,a soft-boiled egg and that way it stays
kJ5PCbtiCpk,359940,362910,nice and creamy firm up the eggs and
kJ5PCbtiCpk,362910,365850,then lay out the sausage really thinly
kJ5PCbtiCpk,365850,368100,and wrap it nice and tightly good
kJ5PCbtiCpk,368100,371220,question am i gourmet chef yet I mean
kJ5PCbtiCpk,371220,374040,seriously you need to take two slices of
kJ5PCbtiCpk,374040,375510,bread and stick them on your ears and
kJ5PCbtiCpk,375510,378690,that's what you've got an idiot sandwich
kJ5PCbtiCpk,378690,381480,got longshot but near enough self-taught
kJ5PCbtiCpk,381480,383640,but still very much learning what can
kJ5PCbtiCpk,383640,385650,you best recommend to complement a
kJ5PCbtiCpk,385650,388530,Wellington the most amazing cream mashed
kJ5PCbtiCpk,388530,390990,potatoes whole roasted carrots whole
kJ5PCbtiCpk,390990,392010,roasted parsnips
kJ5PCbtiCpk,392010,394009,glazed with honey and then
kJ5PCbtiCpk,394009,396199,with an amazing Madeira sauce good luck
kJ5PCbtiCpk,396199,399289,Sam what should I do with a dark green
kJ5PCbtiCpk,399289,400999,part of the leeks can't see myself
kJ5PCbtiCpk,400999,402469,throwing this better way really good
kJ5PCbtiCpk,402469,402889,question
kJ5PCbtiCpk,402889,405559,this part here okay is the magical
kJ5PCbtiCpk,405559,411159,moment take your bay Leafs place in side
kJ5PCbtiCpk,411159,414289,take your rosemary place that inside and
kJ5PCbtiCpk,414289,417919,I spring at a time and then look follow
kJ5PCbtiCpk,417919,420830,that up and then from there you just
kJ5PCbtiCpk,420830,422930,roll it so it looks like this incredible
kJ5PCbtiCpk,422930,425509,tea bag and what that does it puts
kJ5PCbtiCpk,425509,428659,together an amazing bouquet garni tie
kJ5PCbtiCpk,428659,431719,that on to your pan put the bouquet
kJ5PCbtiCpk,431719,433669,garni in stock and it becomes this
kJ5PCbtiCpk,433669,436249,incredible flavored beautiful teabag
kJ5PCbtiCpk,436249,439309,cocoa right so Gordon in your opinion
kJ5PCbtiCpk,439309,441919,what size pasta sheet should I use for a
kJ5PCbtiCpk,441919,444409,good ravioli I use size 3 but they feel
kJ5PCbtiCpk,444409,447680,a bit thick sighs - so forget buying
kJ5PCbtiCpk,447680,450259,sheets make fresh pasta and get used to
kJ5PCbtiCpk,450259,451879,cranking in that machine but the
kJ5PCbtiCpk,451879,453110,thickness of the past that depends on
kJ5PCbtiCpk,453110,454580,the filling so if your filling is cooked
kJ5PCbtiCpk,454580,456379,then you can go super thin if it's
kJ5PCbtiCpk,456379,458449,undercooked then you go super thick this
kJ5PCbtiCpk,458449,460639,is from mo bucks
kJ5PCbtiCpk,460639,463399,what is foie gras torchon Taschen isn't
kJ5PCbtiCpk,463399,465649,is that there's at eat hours of cloth as
kJ5PCbtiCpk,465649,468409,they poach in the cloth it protects the
kJ5PCbtiCpk,468409,470029,foie gras so it's basically foie gras
