EP4Hf63zR6w,1760,7120,now if you happen to have a turbojet  or you're thinking of buying one or if
EP4Hf63zR6w,7120,14240,you watch our video series on this  subject we'll show you how to build one  you really might want to consider adding
EP4Hf63zR6w,14240,17480,an afterburner
EP4Hf63zR6w,28230,31359,[Applause]
EP4Hf63zR6w,35680,38680,uh
EP4Hf63zR6w,50280,56879,[Music]  these little devices can add a
EP4Hf63zR6w,56879,62000,substantial amount of thrust for  relatively low weight low cost and ease
EP4Hf63zR6w,62000,67840,of assembly it's a pretty good thing  now not all jet engines are turbo jet
EP4Hf63zR6w,67840,74799,engines  there are pulse jet engines  pulse detonation engines ram jet engines
EP4Hf63zR6w,74799,81119,and even the very first forays that were  made into the construction of commercial  scale
EP4Hf63zR6w,81119,86479,turbo jet engines were done a little bit  before world war ii where they took
EP4Hf63zR6w,86479,91920,powerful gasoline engines to drive the  compressor stages that compress the air
EP4Hf63zR6w,91920,98320,before the fuel was added and they  produced the exhaust blast  and our very first
EP4Hf63zR6w,98320,103600,videos on the jet series  also used a hybrid type of design where
EP4Hf63zR6w,103600,110560,we took some powerful edfs or electric  ducted fans about five kilowatts each
EP4Hf63zR6w,110560,116240,placed them in series and produced a  modest level of compression  before we added the fuel
EP4Hf63zR6w,116240,122479,heated the exhaust and nearly doubled  the output from the fans alone it really  worked
EP4Hf63zR6w,122479,129039,one of the problems though with any of  these designs is the enormous amount of  energy that's necessary to drive the
EP4Hf63zR6w,129039,137440,compressor stages  just to give you an idea of the  magnitude of that power  if you look at the allison 250 series of
EP4Hf63zR6w,137440,142879,turboshaft engines these are small  turboshaft engines that have been around  for decades
EP4Hf63zR6w,142879,148239,and produce a rotary mechanical output  being driven by the exhaust gases by a
EP4Hf63zR6w,148239,155120,turbine and can range from about 350 to  about 900 shaft horsepower
EP4Hf63zR6w,155120,161760,in those engines  the turbine stage actually sends only  one third of the amount of power that's
EP4Hf63zR6w,161760,166800,extracted to the output shaft  twice as much power as you take out
EP4Hf63zR6w,166800,172560,is actually recirculated to drive the  compressor stages and that's a small  engine
EP4Hf63zR6w,172560,178800,another example is this turbocharger  over here  this single stage compressor just this
EP4Hf63zR6w,178800,184800,little part of this turbocharger at full  power will consume about 250 horsepower
EP4Hf63zR6w,184800,190720,from just this little thing  the power is enormous  and so that's why early on the military
EP4Hf63zR6w,190720,196080,designers decided to take the hot high  pressure high velocity exhaust from the
EP4Hf63zR6w,196080,201920,jet engines  run a turbine and send that power to the  compressor stages
EP4Hf63zR6w,201920,209360,it was lighter and more powerful than  the gasoline engines and hence the birth  of the modern turbo jet engine
EP4Hf63zR6w,209360,215599,we decided to make the same sort of  transition and got away from the hybrid  design and started building jet engines
EP4Hf63zR6w,215599,222720,based on the turbo charger to turbo jet  conversion  now this is actually a pretty popular
EP4Hf63zR6w,222720,228640,project and there's a lot of youtube  videos out there about it because it's  relatively easy to do
EP4Hf63zR6w,228640,235599,because there are millions of these  turbochargers built every year  all of the expensive engineering the
EP4Hf63zR6w,235599,242480,design the precision machining of the  compressor wheels the turbines the  housings the bearings is spread out over
EP4Hf63zR6w,242480,249439,millions of examples  and so all you really have to do to  construct the turbojet is to build the
EP4Hf63zR6w,249439,255439,combustion chamber it's not trivial but  it's a heck of a lot easier than the  other components and if you watch our
EP4Hf63zR6w,255439,260880,videos on the subject we show you how to  do it  now what makes
EP4Hf63zR6w,260880,265919,building an afterburner possible  is that all turbojet engines pass
EP4Hf63zR6w,265919,270960,substantially more air through them than  they actually need to burn the fuel
EP4Hf63zR6w,270960,276560,the reason for that is that if you take  that ideal mixture that golden ratio or
EP4Hf63zR6w,276560,282000,stoichiometric ratio of fuel and air  and you burn the fuel so that you use up
EP4Hf63zR6w,282000,287520,all the oxygen you use up all the fuel  and at the end of the reaction there's  no nothing left behind
EP4Hf63zR6w,287520,295199,you produce a flame temperature that is  so high that you would almost instantly  melt anything downstream of the flame
EP4Hf63zR6w,295199,301440,so what the designers do  in a turbo jet is they take the  compressed air that comes in from the
EP4Hf63zR6w,301440,306800,compressor  they send some of it into the combustion  chamber to burn the fuel
EP4Hf63zR6w,306800,315520,and then as those very hot exhaust gases  are moving down toward the turbine  they allow additional air to dilute that
EP4Hf63zR6w,315520,320639,hot flame more air than was actually  needed to burn the fuel  to bring the temperature down to the
EP4Hf63zR6w,320639,326000,point that it will not melt the turbine  blades this is great because what ends
EP4Hf63zR6w,326000,331360,up happening is at the end product of a  turbojet process you still have a
EP4Hf63zR6w,331360,337360,substantial amount of oxygen in the  exhaust gases  however you've not only cooled the air
EP4Hf63zR6w,337360,342800,by dilution  but the amount of energy that's taken  out by the turbine stages
EP4Hf63zR6w,342800,349280,causes a lot of cooling  shrinking and decrease in pressure of  the gases that are coming out of the
EP4Hf63zR6w,349280,356000,exhaust stage  so what the afterburner does is it takes  advantage of that residual oxygen adds
EP4Hf63zR6w,356000,361600,additional fuel and reheats those  exhaust gases it can double or triple
EP4Hf63zR6w,361600,367600,the volume of those exhaust gases it's  often called a reheater or an
EP4Hf63zR6w,367600,372639,afterburner same principle  by increasing the volume of those gases
EP4Hf63zR6w,372639,379520,if you don't increase the diameter of  the duct through which they're passing  too much  the only way for that much larger volume
EP4Hf63zR6w,379520,386639,to get out is it has to get faster it  has to accelerate  and when you accelerate the same mass of
EP4Hf63zR6w,386639,393199,of air  you increase the momentum mass times  velocity and momentum is another name
EP4Hf63zR6w,393199,398880,for thrust when you're talking about  turbojet engines  this is great i mean when you think
EP4Hf63zR6w,398880,406000,about it it's lightweight it's easy to  build there are no moving parts and  because  you can fabricate these such that there
EP4Hf63zR6w,406000,412400,are no metal contacts to the flame you  can go to extremely high temperatures in  the after burner
EP4Hf63zR6w,412400,420720,so you might think then why aren't  afterburners put on all jet engines  the problem is very low fuel economy
EP4Hf63zR6w,420720,427280,you can double the fuel flow in an  afterburner double the fuel flow that  you're normally using in a uh in the
EP4Hf63zR6w,427280,432560,basic turbojet engine and increase the  thrust maybe 60 or 70 percent
EP4Hf63zR6w,432560,438639,and that might be acceptable if you're  trying to take off from a carrier deck  or you're in a combat maneuver but if
EP4Hf63zR6w,438639,445039,you're flying a commercial jet across  the pacific you're going to probably end  up in the water  now the reason for that is not because
EP4Hf63zR6w,445039,451440,the afterburner  fails to burn all of the fuel it does  it's an efficient way to burn the fuel
EP4Hf63zR6w,451440,456479,the reason for this is a fundamental  fundamental physical property that is
EP4Hf63zR6w,456479,461759,inescapable and it's  present  in the operation any kind of internal
EP4Hf63zR6w,461759,468080,combustion engine and a jet engine is an  internal combustion engine  this principle is so important that even
EP4Hf63zR6w,468080,473520,though i reviewed this  some time ago i'm gonna go through it  again because i think it'll help to
EP4Hf63zR6w,473520,478840,understand  what i'm talking about
EP4Hf63zR6w,479680,488160,if i take this air piston here  and i plug the output hole from this
EP4Hf63zR6w,488160,493360,and i compress the gas inside of the  cylinder my muscles are doing work on
EP4Hf63zR6w,493360,499039,the gas inside the cylinder force times  distance  if i allow the piston to move back the
EP4Hf63zR6w,499039,504960,gas to expand the gas does work on my  muscles  one unit of work in one unit of workout
EP4Hf63zR6w,504960,510080,no big deal if however  i take this piston and i compress the
EP4Hf63zR6w,510080,515279,gas twice  then i place it in a heat source and
EP4Hf63zR6w,515279,520399,begin heating the gas to twice its  absolute temperature so if it's 300
EP4Hf63zR6w,520399,526240,kelvin goes to 600 kelvin if it's 0  degrees celsius goes to 300 degrees  celsius
EP4Hf63zR6w,526240,531920,at that point the pressure of the gas  molecules inside roughly doubles
EP4Hf63zR6w,531920,537440,now when i allow it to expand the force  at every point in that expansion is
EP4Hf63zR6w,537440,542560,twice as great as it was when i  compressed it so i get two units of work  out
EP4Hf63zR6w,542560,548720,one unit in  heated up  two units out one net unit of work okay
EP4Hf63zR6w,548720,555680,do it again but this time i push the  cylinder in much harder and i bring the  pressure to four times its original
EP4Hf63zR6w,555680,561279,level  now again i heat the gas  same amount of heat same number of air
EP4Hf63zR6w,561279,566480,molecules and i bring the pressure up to  roughly twice its original point
EP4Hf63zR6w,566480,571839,now when i allow the piston to move back  it's moving farther and at greater force
EP4Hf63zR6w,571839,578560,and so i get two large units of work in  the point being
EP4Hf63zR6w,579600,586320,that the more work you invest in the  beginning in the compression stage the  more usable work you can get out at the
EP4Hf63zR6w,586320,593360,end now for your physicists out there  yes i am rounding off some of the ideal  gas law numbers but the underlying
EP4Hf63zR6w,593360,599120,principle remains  more compressive work in  more usable work out
EP4Hf63zR6w,599120,605600,and this is one of the reasons why a  diesel engine is more efficient than a  gasoline engine a typical gasoline
EP4Hf63zR6w,605600,612240,engine will have a compression ratio of  maybe eight nine ten to one  a diesel engine maybe eighteen to twenty
EP4Hf63zR6w,612240,618480,to one and a high performance turbo jet  engine can exceed fifty to one five zero
EP4Hf63zR6w,618480,624320,to one it's a very efficient heat engine  and that's what the problem is with the
EP4Hf63zR6w,624320,629920,efficiency of an afterburner because the  turbine stage has removed a lot of work
EP4Hf63zR6w,629920,635839,energy from the fuel from the gas  the pressure drops inside of the
EP4Hf63zR6w,635839,641519,afterburner and so when you're adding  the fuel you're adding it at a lower  compression ratio than when it was burnt
EP4Hf63zR6w,641519,647279,inside of the turbojet there's no way to  avoid that  but if you want to take off from a
EP4Hf63zR6w,647279,652800,carrier jet deck  it's the way to go  and if we really don't care about fuel
EP4Hf63zR6w,652800,659040,prices you know they're as low as  they're ever going to get right now then  we don't care either we just want more
EP4Hf63zR6w,659040,664720,power  so with that basis in physics behind us  let's go outside and let's fire up the
EP4Hf63zR6w,664720,667519,turbojet engine
EP4Hf63zR6w,672640,678959,all right this is the turbojet and as  you can see it looks pretty complicated  you can put down your paper and your
EP4Hf63zR6w,678959,684480,pencil if you're interested in  designing something like this or using  some of the ideas that we have we're
EP4Hf63zR6w,684480,690959,going to follow this video with a series  of short few minute videos that are  going to break this down into all the
EP4Hf63zR6w,690959,696079,subsystems including the source for the  parts that we're using and how we build
EP4Hf63zR6w,696079,702320,this and how we operate this so for  today you can just watch me go through  the abbreviated startup sequence and
EP4Hf63zR6w,702320,706680,enjoy so let's get going
EP4Hf63zR6w,733680,737200,all right let's get some headphones
EP4Hf63zR6w,740959,746160,now we're going to start by turning on  the oil pump and the fuel pump
EP4Hf63zR6w,746320,751839,we're going to adjust the oil pressure  to about 40 psi
EP4Hf63zR6w,756240,760720,and the fuel pressure to about 50 psi
EP4Hf63zR6w,762240,767680,now when i turn on the starter fan  everything is going to get so loud  everything will have to be in text boxes
EP4Hf63zR6w,767680,771480,you're not going to hear me
EP4Hf63zR6w,773600,777160,all right here we go
EP4Hf63zR6w,819199,822199,so
EP4Hf63zR6w,834480,837480,so
EP4Hf63zR6w,842070,845289,[Music]
EP4Hf63zR6w,853680,860079,all right one of the nice things about  having the starter fan on here is that  when we're done with a run
EP4Hf63zR6w,860079,866160,rather than waiting an hour for this  thing to cool off as it radiates its  heat we can run this at a low level for
EP4Hf63zR6w,866160,872290,about 10 minutes and we can  exchange parts so i'm going to do that  right now
EP4Hf63zR6w,872290,876639,[Applause]  okay
EP4Hf63zR6w,877839,883279,okay so now let's get into the nitty and  the gritty of the actual afterburner  design
EP4Hf63zR6w,883279,890399,now this is a nozzle i took this off the  jet engine that we just demonstrated  and almost invariably you're going to
EP4Hf63zR6w,890399,897120,want to have a nozzle on the output of  any kind of a turbo jet engine  the reason for that is that the exhaust
EP4Hf63zR6w,897120,903519,gases that come out behind the turbine  or in the case of a turbocharger from  the x deucer
EP4Hf63zR6w,903519,910480,are still under some residual pressure  and you want to convert that pressure  into greater velocity what the nozzle
EP4Hf63zR6w,910480,918079,does is just like putting your thumb  over the end of a garden hose it causes  the gas  molecules to speed up more momentum more
EP4Hf63zR6w,918079,923440,thrust  now the design of a nozzle  is in theory
EP4Hf63zR6w,923440,929920,pretty difficult to model because there  are so many variables  it depends on the ar ratio of the
EP4Hf63zR6w,929920,936399,turbocharger this is a value that  determines the mass flow versus  compression ratio of a particular model
EP4Hf63zR6w,936399,943120,and it varies it also depends on what  kind of pressures you're running inside  of your combustion chamber even the
EP4Hf63zR6w,943120,950000,bypass ratio and the fuel that you're  using it's pretty difficult to model  but in practice it's actually very easy
EP4Hf63zR6w,950000,957199,to do  what you do is you obtain a flange that  will mount onto your turbocharger
EP4Hf63zR6w,957199,963839,and then place a rather aggressive taper  on the output  aggressive being that if you start with
EP4Hf63zR6w,963839,969600,a ratio of two to one in area so not  diameter but the area of the output is
EP4Hf63zR6w,969600,975199,half the area of the input  this is almost certainly going to be a  little too much
EP4Hf63zR6w,975199,980320,once you've fabricated that bring it out  to the engine connect it up and run it  up
EP4Hf63zR6w,980320,986160,measure your fuel flow your pressure  your thrust your temperatures  then take it off
EP4Hf63zR6w,986160,993440,bring it inside and slice a couple of  millimeters off opening up the aperture  just a little bit and test it again
EP4Hf63zR6w,993440,999279,do this several times until the numbers  that you care about stop getting better
EP4Hf63zR6w,999279,1004480,you're done it's that easy and it might  sound like a little bit of work but it's  fun because that's why you built the
EP4Hf63zR6w,1004480,1011440,turbocharger in the first place into a  jet engine you want to mess around with  it  now the afterburners themselves are
EP4Hf63zR6w,1011440,1016560,relatively easy to build because of the  fact that there's so much aftermarket  availability
EP4Hf63zR6w,1016560,1024798,of compatible components to  turbochargers you can get flanges of  different sizes and styles t3
EP4Hf63zR6w,1024798,1030558,t4  four bolt  flares tapers tubing that all sort of
EP4Hf63zR6w,1030558,1038400,work together so that all you really  have to do is cut the tubing  drill some holes and do some welding it
EP4Hf63zR6w,1038400,1045199,makes it a lot easier for you to do  simply because you don't have to  fabricate the tubes  now the designers of a military
EP4Hf63zR6w,1045199,1050799,afterburner  face much bigger challenges because if  you're going to put an afterburner on a
EP4Hf63zR6w,1050799,1056000,fighter jet you want it as light as  compact and as efficient as possible you
EP4Hf63zR6w,1056000,1062080,don't want a huge stove pipe sticking  out of the back of a fighter jet  the problem is that turbojet exhaust
EP4Hf63zR6w,1062080,1067679,velocities even in our little turbojets  approach mach 1.
EP4Hf63zR6w,1067679,1073520,and so literally you only have a few  milliseconds for all of the fuel to be  added
EP4Hf63zR6w,1073520,1080320,mix and blend evaporate burn and expand  before it gets out of the exhaust duct
EP4Hf63zR6w,1080320,1087840,that's tough  and it has to happen inside of the  afterburner  if you have the burn continue outside of
EP4Hf63zR6w,1087840,1094240,the afterburner it may look cool may  look like a nice blow torch but it does  nothing because all of the expansion of
EP4Hf63zR6w,1094240,1100000,the gas is happening in the free  atmosphere it has to happen in the  confines of the duct in order for that
EP4Hf63zR6w,1100000,1105919,velocity to accelerate and produce more  thrust  so what the professionals do
EP4Hf63zR6w,1105919,1112080,is they install what are called  turbulators or flame holders  these are little obstructions that are
EP4Hf63zR6w,1112080,1117520,placed in the output of the exhaust of  the jet engine often they're shaped like
EP4Hf63zR6w,1117520,1123440,v  grooves in rings or in  bars across the output
EP4Hf63zR6w,1123440,1130240,and they do two things one is they  increase the turbulence and the mixing  of the fuel and the air that's important
EP4Hf63zR6w,1130240,1137919,but more important what they do is they  produce a shadowed area of relatively  low velocity gas right behind them
EP4Hf63zR6w,1137919,1143039,that's important because it's very  difficult if not impossible to maintain
EP4Hf63zR6w,1143039,1150000,a stable flame  in an exhaust velocity that exceeds the  flame front propagation velocity it's
EP4Hf63zR6w,1150000,1157200,one of the reasons why you could put out  an oil well fire with a stick of  dynamite  so by placing these things in in the
EP4Hf63zR6w,1157200,1163120,exhaust you improve the stability of the  flame  but anything that you put in the exhaust
EP4Hf63zR6w,1163120,1169600,path obstructs some of the exhaust  coming out of the engine so can decrease  the efficiency of the underlying jet so
EP4Hf63zR6w,1169600,1175760,it's a very delicate balance that they  have to perform to get  good performance overall
EP4Hf63zR6w,1175760,1182640,we're not putting these afterburners on  a fighter jet and so we can take  advantage of a few tricks that makes  this a lot easier to do
EP4Hf63zR6w,1182640,1189440,first of all  we can make the ducting that the app  much larger in
EP4Hf63zR6w,1189440,1196640,moving through it more slowly  then we can make it much longer so that  more slowly moving gas has to travel a
EP4Hf63zR6w,1196640,1203520,longer distance this gives us more time  for the reaction to occur  in addition the flare or the increase in
EP4Hf63zR6w,1203520,1210400,diameter of the tubing also introduces  turbulent mixing  gas that's traveling right up the axis
EP4Hf63zR6w,1210400,1216400,the center portion of the output from  the jet engine is moving fastest the gas  that's
EP4Hf63zR6w,1216400,1224720,sliding along the walls is moving more  slowly and so what you get is sort of a  rotating toroid or donut or snow smoke
EP4Hf63zR6w,1224720,1231679,ring as the gases are moving up the end  of the tube  this can be enough to give you a stable
EP4Hf63zR6w,1231679,1237840,afterburner function  we found it was a little iffy so we  decided to add some flame holders and i
EP4Hf63zR6w,1237840,1244000,found it's kind of a neat and convenient  way to do this and it's very flexible  right at the point where the tube has
EP4Hf63zR6w,1244000,1249360,increased in diameter and the gas  velocity is decreased drilled eight
EP4Hf63zR6w,1249360,1255440,holes four pairs 180 degrees apart and  then welded on some threaded studs over
EP4Hf63zR6w,1255440,1263200,those holes  then  you take a solid rod like this piece of  tungsten welding rod and you cut it to
EP4Hf63zR6w,1263200,1269600,slightly longer than the outside  diameter of the tube  insert it into opposing holes and then
EP4Hf63zR6w,1269600,1275679,just take some screws or some set screws  and lock it into position  what's nice about that is you can add
EP4Hf63zR6w,1275679,1282080,one two three up to four  flame holders of varying diameters
EP4Hf63zR6w,1282080,1287200,an even better way that we did in sort  of version 2.0 is we took some thin wall
EP4Hf63zR6w,1287200,1293360,stainless steel tubing  cut it to slightly less than the inside  diameter of the tube
EP4Hf63zR6w,1293360,1299600,located it over the holes and then drove  screws into each end that allows us to  lock this into position
EP4Hf63zR6w,1299600,1307120,this also gives us the ability to add a  wide variety of different diameter tubes  and another little trick is in the
EP4Hf63zR6w,1307120,1313679,middle position put this in a vise with  a couple of metal blocks and squish the  middle together so that when these stack
EP4Hf63zR6w,1313679,1319120,they can stack more closely together and  you make the segment where the flame  holder is a little bit thinner just
EP4Hf63zR6w,1319120,1326080,makes it more convenient  and it works  i know a fair amount of engineering as
EP4Hf63zR6w,1326080,1332640,i'm sure a lot of you do too  and there's always a risk that you can  get a little cocky you can think you
EP4Hf63zR6w,1332640,1337760,know a little bit more than you actually  do  and that's particularly egregious when
EP4Hf63zR6w,1337760,1345280,you ignore real world evidence because  it kind of gets between you and your  beautiful design or your theory
EP4Hf63zR6w,1345280,1350799,and i'm guilty of both  the autoignition temperature of kerosene
EP4Hf63zR6w,1350799,1356159,or jet fuel is 210 degrees celsius which  is about a third to a quarter of the
EP4Hf63zR6w,1356159,1361520,exhaust gas temperature coming out of  the turbojet  so i was certain that as long as i got
EP4Hf63zR6w,1361520,1366799,real good mixing of the fuel in the air  it would just burst into flame
EP4Hf63zR6w,1366799,1373679,despite the fact that i was aware  that most if not all  military afterburners include a
EP4Hf63zR6w,1373679,1379120,secondary ignition source the  afterburner  and i had seen a video from a really
EP4Hf63zR6w,1379120,1387600,good channel on turbojet engines called  agentjz you might want to check them out  about 10 years ago they ran a j79 turbo
EP4Hf63zR6w,1387600,1394799,jet engine that had been outfitted with  an afterburner and during the test the  afterburner secondary ignition system
EP4Hf63zR6w,1394799,1402400,failed to light and they ended up  blowing jet fuel into the field behind  the test shed didn't work but i just
EP4Hf63zR6w,1402400,1408400,plowed right ahead put the afterburner  on the engine ran everything up and
EP4Hf63zR6w,1408400,1413600,it didn't work  so  i ended up drilling a couple more holes
EP4Hf63zR6w,1413600,1419600,welding on some larger studs and  threading them to put a spark plug  inside of the afterburner ran it up
EP4Hf63zR6w,1419600,1426320,again with a second ignition system  worked like a champ  you live and you learn
EP4Hf63zR6w,1426320,1434080,now i'm still not certain  why it doesn't work the best theory i  have at this point is that autoignition
EP4Hf63zR6w,1434080,1440880,temperatures are published for  atmospheric oxygen levels  and although there still is substantial
EP4Hf63zR6w,1440880,1447200,amount of oxygen in the gas coming  through the afterburner the turbojet has  consumed a substantial amount as well
EP4Hf63zR6w,1447200,1454240,so it may be that the autoignition  temperatures are much more sensitive  to oxygen concentration than i had
EP4Hf63zR6w,1454240,1461279,thought  now if you know the answer  or you have a different theory  put it in the comments section below i
EP4Hf63zR6w,1461279,1467039,read them all and maybe you come up with  a better answer and i'd be really  interested in hearing about it
EP4Hf63zR6w,1467039,1472400,now  this is generally where the amateurs  stop
EP4Hf63zR6w,1472400,1478960,it's not where the pros stop and not  where we decided to stop  if you're going to bother to invest in
EP4Hf63zR6w,1478960,1485120,putting an afterburner on a jet engine  you want the most punch out of that  afterburner you can get in other words
EP4Hf63zR6w,1485120,1491360,you want the flame temperatures in there  as high as possible  however nearly 3000 degrees will melt
EP4Hf63zR6w,1491360,1497760,just about anything you could make the  duct out of so what they do cleverly is  they build a second inner
EP4Hf63zR6w,1497760,1503520,shell or cylinder of thin steel  and perforate it with thousands of tiny
EP4Hf63zR6w,1503520,1508640,little holes  that cylinder  sits inside of the duct with a little
EP4Hf63zR6w,1508640,1514720,annular space between the duct wall and  the cylinder  and some of the exhaust gases that come
EP4Hf63zR6w,1514720,1521600,from the turbojet  actually travel around in between that  gap and bleed in through those holes
EP4Hf63zR6w,1521600,1526880,providing a little inner buffer layer  between the hot flame and the steel
EP4Hf63zR6w,1526880,1531919,it works if you take a look at a typical  example of an afterburner firing up on a
EP4Hf63zR6w,1531919,1537279,fighter jet you'll see that the gases  inside are incandescently hot but the
EP4Hf63zR6w,1537279,1544640,walls if they're glowing at all are  usually glowing a relatively dull color  or they're not even glowing it does work
EP4Hf63zR6w,1544640,1551679,so that's what we did in version 2.0  fabricated a container tube or an outer
EP4Hf63zR6w,1551679,1558320,tube out of thin wall stainless steel  tubing  welded a flange on the back so that we  could mount this on the output from the
EP4Hf63zR6w,1558320,1564559,jet engine  and then placed a feed through for the  spark plug and for the fuel
EP4Hf63zR6w,1564559,1570000,this tube here is about three and a half  inches od or about eight and a half  centimeters and it's about a half a
EP4Hf63zR6w,1570000,1577360,meter long  at the far end we put a small reduction  in diameter a little nozzle but you'll
EP4Hf63zR6w,1577360,1583520,notice that this nozzle is substantially  smaller than the one that was used on  the same engine because we need to get
EP4Hf63zR6w,1583520,1589120,out a much larger volume of gas that's  been created by the additional heat
EP4Hf63zR6w,1589120,1596400,inside of this tube  is the inner liner tube  what i did with this is took a shorter
EP4Hf63zR6w,1596400,1601600,piece of stainless steel tubing this is  about 40 centimeters or 16 inches long
EP4Hf63zR6w,1601600,1607679,placed it on a lathe and just use the  lathe to scribe lines about one  centimeter apart
EP4Hf63zR6w,1607679,1615200,and then drew lines with the tool 16  lines like this to produce a grid to  locate the position of the holes
EP4Hf63zR6w,1615200,1621120,then  welded a cone on this end  and threaded the end of the cone to
EP4Hf63zR6w,1621120,1627279,accept a quarter npt fitting  sort of a plumbing type fitting
EP4Hf63zR6w,1627279,1632320,and i have a right angle your lock  fitting right in here that screws in and
EP4Hf63zR6w,1632320,1639120,in the end of this fitting i placed  a misting fuel nozzle like this
EP4Hf63zR6w,1639120,1645440,now because i didn't want to reach in in  order to be able to get this inside  i simply took the inside of the tubing
EP4Hf63zR6w,1645440,1651120,of the right angle fitting and threaded  it for 1 8 npt a much finer thread like
EP4Hf63zR6w,1651120,1657600,this  put this thing in the lathe and turn  down the outer mushroom shape of the end
EP4Hf63zR6w,1657600,1663440,of the nozzle this is the exact same  nozzle turned down and before  fabricating so that this entire
EP4Hf63zR6w,1663440,1671200,apparatus can slip in from the end and i  can change different nozzle sizes this  produces about an 80 degree spread of
EP4Hf63zR6w,1671200,1676399,fuel into the cone and into the  beginning part of the  tube here
EP4Hf63zR6w,1676399,1682640,then welded four studs on each end 90  degrees apart that keep this centered  inside of here
EP4Hf63zR6w,1682640,1688399,and then began drilling holes  the design of the holes is similar and  based on the same philosophy of the
EP4Hf63zR6w,1688399,1693520,flame holder inside of a turbojet engine  we start out with a large number of very
EP4Hf63zR6w,1693520,1700080,tiny holes that provide mixing of the  fuel and the air and a relatively  low air velocity
EP4Hf63zR6w,1700080,1705760,then we complement that by threading  some of those holes and placing some  fine thread
EP4Hf63zR6w,1705760,1712480,button  cap head screws  this provides the flame holders and then  right behind that mixture of fuel and
EP4Hf63zR6w,1712480,1718640,air we locate the port for the spark  plug  that fuel that begins burning here is
EP4Hf63zR6w,1718640,1723679,still burning pretty rich and as this  moves down it begins to gain more and
EP4Hf63zR6w,1723679,1728960,more air to assure that we get a full  burn of the fuel air mixture
EP4Hf63zR6w,1728960,1734559,finally near the end i increased the  number of holes to make sure that we  didn't get any flow resistance from the
EP4Hf63zR6w,1734559,1740320,large quantity of air that's coming into  our gas exhaust coming into the  afterburner engine
EP4Hf63zR6w,1740320,1746320,an interesting thing you can see  something that i didn't optimize  is the color differential here
EP4Hf63zR6w,1746320,1752480,i probably should have started these  holes a little bit lower maybe a little  smaller maybe
EP4Hf63zR6w,1752480,1758880,not so many of them because as the gas  was flowing into the tube and the  pressure was dropping on the outer
EP4Hf63zR6w,1758880,1764960,annular space between these two tubes we  were getting less and less protective  cooling at this end and this end got a
EP4Hf63zR6w,1764960,1770320,little bit hotter it didn't melt it it  certainly didn't make it not function  but you can see it's somewhat of an
EP4Hf63zR6w,1770320,1778000,iterative  trial and error type of process  240 holes here 120 holes here 60 holes
EP4Hf63zR6w,1778000,1784000,here three millimeters five millimeters  that's it
EP4Hf63zR6w,1784000,1791840,now the way this assembles  is  let's see if i can get this lined up
EP4Hf63zR6w,1792000,1797760,the inner tube  feeds into this outer tube with minimal  clearances so i have to sometimes wiggle
EP4Hf63zR6w,1797760,1802919,this around a little bit to get it to  fit
EP4Hf63zR6w,1811120,1818159,[Music]  there we go piece of cake
EP4Hf63zR6w,1818159,1823840,then as i slide this in  when this hole lines up with the spark  plug
EP4Hf63zR6w,1823840,1829520,this input for the your lock fitting  lines up with the input of the fuel
EP4Hf63zR6w,1829520,1836640,we get this in here like this  get the pipe to seat in here tighten
EP4Hf63zR6w,1836640,1841679,these nuts like this  install the spark plug like this
EP4Hf63zR6w,1841679,1848240,and we're ready to go  so let's go outside hook this guy up and  i'll show you how it works
EP4Hf63zR6w,1848880,1854960,all right so we've installed this on the  end of the turbojet we're using a little  flare coupling to allow us to use a v
EP4Hf63zR6w,1854960,1861039,band clamp that takes the two flanges  and holds them together and by tightly  screwing this together it squeezes this
EP4Hf63zR6w,1861039,1868640,and puts a lot of pressure on the two  approximate faces  this is the fuel supply for the kerosene
EP4Hf63zR6w,1868640,1874640,or the jet fuel that goes into the  afterburner this is a check valve that  prevents retrograde flow if we had any
EP4Hf63zR6w,1874640,1880559,kind of a problem we're not going to  feed hot gases into the fuel system this  is the spark plug and this is a
EP4Hf63zR6w,1880559,1886080,secondary support system that just  provides additional support so that  we're not just levering everything off
EP4Hf63zR6w,1886080,1893440,of the end of the  turbojet so now we're ready to go let's  get this thing fired up
EP4Hf63zR6w,1893440,1898960,all right so now what we're going to do  is run it up the same as we did the last  time except now i have the separate fuel
EP4Hf63zR6w,1898960,1904640,pump  and the ignition system for the  afterburner  so here we go
EP4Hf63zR6w,1904640,1911279,turn on the oil pump  and adjust it to about 40 psi
EP4Hf63zR6w,1912720,1918278,the fuel pump  adjusted to about 50 psi
EP4Hf63zR6w,1923200,1928880,all right  then we hit the ignition
EP4Hf63zR6w,1930720,1935480,and turn on the fan it's going to get  pretty loud
EP4Hf63zR6w,1953600,1956600,so
EP4Hf63zR6w,1966240,1969240,so
EP4Hf63zR6w,1979519,1982519,so
EP4Hf63zR6w,2018990,2022528,[Applause]
EP4Hf63zR6w,2025810,2029060,[Applause]
EP4Hf63zR6w,2034180,2041200,[Applause]  it works
EP4Hf63zR6w,2041200,2048079,now the interesting thing  about an afterburner is that  you can put almost anything you want
EP4Hf63zR6w,2048079,2053440,through there to burn  you can use jet fuel or kerosene you can
EP4Hf63zR6w,2053440,2060398,use diesel fuel  you can use alcohol isopropyl alcohol  and even rum
EP4Hf63zR6w,2060398,2067520,disappointing thing is it's so hot uh  once you fire it up you can't smell the  rum so but it does work
EP4Hf63zR6w,2067520,2075280,in addition you can use the same design  to put other things through the  afterburner that you don't burn
EP4Hf63zR6w,2075280,2080480,so what we're going to do is we're going  to refit this with model 1.0 and we're
EP4Hf63zR6w,2080480,2085679,going to put some fog juice through it  we'll see what happens
EP4Hf63zR6w,2086480,2091919,okay so we took out the mark ii  afterburner and put in mark one
EP4Hf63zR6w,2091919,2097760,this one does not have any ignition  system hooked up to it and we took off  the accelerating cone on the end but
EP4Hf63zR6w,2097760,2104720,left the flame holders and this is what  we're going to be pumping the fog juice  into i think you'll like it
EP4Hf63zR6w,2106480,2112000,all right so we're going to run it up  one more time we're going to use the  afterburner fuel system not the ignition
EP4Hf63zR6w,2112000,2116760,system to pump in the fog juice
EP4Hf63zR6w,2120410,2123569,[Applause]
EP4Hf63zR6w,2127839,2133640,all right  here we go gonna be loud
EP4Hf63zR6w,2134120,2190409,[Music]
EP4Hf63zR6w,2192079,2238320,do  [Music]
EP4Hf63zR6w,2238320,2245200,man i love my job  this is a heck of a lot of fun  so in any case you can use these
EP4Hf63zR6w,2245200,2251839,afterburners for a variety of different  purposes and if you want to produce fog  and you don't want to just do say a high
EP4Hf63zR6w,2251839,2258800,school performance of river dance or a  little disco performance but you want to  say cover the intersection of a road or
EP4Hf63zR6w,2258800,2264560,maybe a small town  this is your baby  we're also going to be following this up
EP4Hf63zR6w,2264560,2271440,as i said with several very short videos  that break down the subsystems of this  unit so that you can reproduce this and
EP4Hf63zR6w,2271440,2277119,we'll give you all the parts and pieces  and  plans and ideas about what you need to  know in order to be able to make this
EP4Hf63zR6w,2277119,2283760,work  and i want to thank you very much for  watching  stay safe  you have a lot of fun
EP4Hf63zR6w,2283760,2287320,and we'll see you soon
EP4Hf63zR6w,2289420,2304160,[Music]
EP4Hf63zR6w,2304160,2306240,you
