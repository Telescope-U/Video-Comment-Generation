Tiy7i6uc960,80,2000,penne arabiata
Tiy7i6uc960,2000,3520,there are three things i love about this
Tiy7i6uc960,3520,6799,dish it's elegant it's earthy
Tiy7i6uc960,6799,8960,and you can make it ahead i mean what's
Tiy7i6uc960,8960,10390,not to love about that
Tiy7i6uc960,10390,13460,[Music]
Tiy7i6uc960,14799,17119,i'm making penne arabiata
Tiy7i6uc960,17119,18720,rubiata sauce is really kind of a
Tiy7i6uc960,18720,20800,classic italian pasta sauce
Tiy7i6uc960,20800,22320,made with tomatoes
Tiy7i6uc960,22320,24240,mine has an unbelievable amount of
Tiy7i6uc960,24240,25680,garlic in it which i'm going to cook
Tiy7i6uc960,25680,28240,very slowly in olive oil
Tiy7i6uc960,28240,29439,it's going to be really sweet and
Tiy7i6uc960,29439,30480,delicious
Tiy7i6uc960,30480,31599,so
Tiy7i6uc960,31599,34239,nobody wants to peel 24 cloves of garlic
Tiy7i6uc960,34239,37040,so what i do is i blanch them in a pot
Tiy7i6uc960,37040,39040,of boiling water just for about 15
Tiy7i6uc960,39040,41040,seconds and then you'll see the skins
Tiy7i6uc960,41040,44079,just slip right off just like that okay
Tiy7i6uc960,44079,46160,so that's a cup so i've got two thirds
Tiy7i6uc960,46160,48160,of a cup of olive oil that i've got
Tiy7i6uc960,48160,51360,warmed i'm gonna put the garlic in
Tiy7i6uc960,51360,53440,and just cook it for about 10 minutes
Tiy7i6uc960,53440,55760,just until the outside is like just
Tiy7i6uc960,55760,57760,barely browned and the inside's really
Tiy7i6uc960,57760,58879,tender
Tiy7i6uc960,58879,60399,okay we'll let that cook for about 10
Tiy7i6uc960,60399,62718,minutes
Tiy7i6uc960,64720,66960,okay next is the tomatoes so i've got
Tiy7i6uc960,66960,68960,two 28 ounce cans of san marzano
Tiy7i6uc960,68960,70640,tomatoes
Tiy7i6uc960,70640,72400,i think san marzano are the best quality
Tiy7i6uc960,72400,73840,canned tomatoes
Tiy7i6uc960,73840,76080,and i've got whole tomatoes i'm gonna
Tiy7i6uc960,76080,78479,put them in the food processor and just
Tiy7i6uc960,78479,80320,chop them up i'm just putting in the
Tiy7i6uc960,80320,82080,food processor so i can control the
Tiy7i6uc960,82080,84159,consistency of the tomatoes and i'm
Tiy7i6uc960,84159,85439,draining them because i don't want the
Tiy7i6uc960,85439,87920,sauce to be watery nobody wants watery
Tiy7i6uc960,87920,89280,sauce
Tiy7i6uc960,89280,91280,okay i can make bloody mary's out of the
Tiy7i6uc960,91280,92960,rest
Tiy7i6uc960,92960,93920,okay
Tiy7i6uc960,93920,96799,get them in good
Tiy7i6uc960,96799,98159,and then i'm just gonna
Tiy7i6uc960,98159,101439,chop them up
Tiy7i6uc960,101439,103280,just like that
Tiy7i6uc960,103280,104640,you don't want to puree you just want
Tiy7i6uc960,104640,106399,them roughly chopped
Tiy7i6uc960,106399,108560,okay i think the
Tiy7i6uc960,108560,110640,garlic is just about ready and i'll show
Tiy7i6uc960,110640,112240,you what i was looking for these are
Tiy7i6uc960,112240,114479,great i wish you could smell it nicely
Tiy7i6uc960,114479,116000,browned on the outside and perfectly
Tiy7i6uc960,116000,117119,cooked through
Tiy7i6uc960,117119,119439,okay i'm gonna take the garlic and put
Tiy7i6uc960,119439,122960,it right into the tomatoes
Tiy7i6uc960,123680,125920,and then i'm gonna chop that up
Tiy7i6uc960,125920,128399,and then cook it all together with some
Tiy7i6uc960,128399,130800,fennel
Tiy7i6uc960,131440,133440,this recipe actually is inspired by
Tiy7i6uc960,133440,134959,missy robbins who has the most
Tiy7i6uc960,134959,137920,incredible pasta restaurant in new york
Tiy7i6uc960,137920,139920,called missy it's in brooklyn
Tiy7i6uc960,139920,141680,and she makes her a raviota sauce with
Tiy7i6uc960,141680,143599,24 cloves of garlic
Tiy7i6uc960,143599,146560,and it's so good
Tiy7i6uc960,148160,149680,and then i'm just going to chop that up
Tiy7i6uc960,149680,153120,so you get bits of garlic in the sauce
Tiy7i6uc960,153120,155040,and then this whole thing goes right
Tiy7i6uc960,155040,156879,back into the oil
Tiy7i6uc960,156879,158080,try and do it without getting it all
Tiy7i6uc960,158080,160640,over yourself
Tiy7i6uc960,163360,166959,so this is going back on the stove
Tiy7i6uc960,167920,169360,turn on the heat
Tiy7i6uc960,169360,170959,and i'm going to take two teaspoons of
Tiy7i6uc960,170959,172879,fennel seeds
Tiy7i6uc960,172879,174800,you can do it in a mortar and pestle but
Tiy7i6uc960,174800,177120,i think this is actually better to grind
Tiy7i6uc960,177120,178959,them yourself what i do is just chop
Tiy7i6uc960,178959,180720,them up and they're going to bounce all
Tiy7i6uc960,180720,182480,over the place but it's really worth it
Tiy7i6uc960,182480,183760,and i think what you do is you get a lot
Tiy7i6uc960,183760,186239,of the oils out of the fennel seeds
Tiy7i6uc960,186239,187920,just give it a rough chop like that
Tiy7i6uc960,187920,189440,they're going to get tenderized when the
Tiy7i6uc960,189440,191200,sauce cooks
Tiy7i6uc960,191200,192640,i actually prefer using whole fennel
Tiy7i6uc960,192640,194720,seed rather than ground ground kind of
Tiy7i6uc960,194720,196879,loses its flavor when you chop up whole
Tiy7i6uc960,196879,198400,fennel seed you get all of those
Tiy7i6uc960,198400,200640,essential oils in it and fennel has this
Tiy7i6uc960,200640,202959,like anise flavor that's just great
Tiy7i6uc960,202959,204640,particularly with tomatoes
Tiy7i6uc960,204640,207440,okay right into the sauce
Tiy7i6uc960,207440,209440,right there
Tiy7i6uc960,209440,212239,one teaspoon of hot red pepper flakes
Tiy7i6uc960,212239,213920,okay next is a third of a cup of red
Tiy7i6uc960,213920,215200,wine
Tiy7i6uc960,215200,216720,i'm using an italian wine of course
Tiy7i6uc960,216720,218799,since it's an italian dish
Tiy7i6uc960,218799,220720,i'm using a chianti you want something
Tiy7i6uc960,220720,222879,very dry and kind of rough
Tiy7i6uc960,222879,225200,two-thirds of a cup
Tiy7i6uc960,225200,227760,just pour it right in
Tiy7i6uc960,227760,230000,yum tablespoon salt make sure it's
Tiy7i6uc960,230000,232959,really well seasoned
Tiy7i6uc960,235760,238319,teaspoon of
Tiy7i6uc960,238840,240879,pepper i'm always looking for how
Tiy7i6uc960,240879,242480,flavors complement each other how the
Tiy7i6uc960,242480,244959,tomatoes make the red wine taste better
Tiy7i6uc960,244959,246879,how the red wine makes the fennel taste
Tiy7i6uc960,246879,248959,better
Tiy7i6uc960,248959,250720,this is going to do exactly that the
Tiy7i6uc960,250720,252400,garlic flavor is everything so i'm just
Tiy7i6uc960,252400,254239,going to bring it to a boil and then
Tiy7i6uc960,254239,255920,lower the heat and let it simmer for 30
Tiy7i6uc960,255920,258238,minutes
Tiy7i6uc960,262479,264720,i'm almost done with the arabiata sauce
Tiy7i6uc960,264720,266240,i'm just going to add some fresh basil
Tiy7i6uc960,266240,268320,to it gives it a nice fresh kind of
Tiy7i6uc960,268320,269759,peppery flavor
Tiy7i6uc960,269759,271759,okay about a quarter of a cup right into
Tiy7i6uc960,271759,274320,the sauce
Tiy7i6uc960,275600,277360,so i've got a big pot of boiling water
Tiy7i6uc960,277360,280080,salt and one pound of penne and i'm
Tiy7i6uc960,280080,281680,cooking it to about two minutes less
Tiy7i6uc960,281680,284479,than it requires for al dente and that's
Tiy7i6uc960,284479,286880,because i'm gonna cook it in the sauce
Tiy7i6uc960,286880,287840,so
Tiy7i6uc960,287840,290800,let's see how it's doing
Tiy7i6uc960,290800,292960,okay great it's perfect with a wire
Tiy7i6uc960,292960,294560,strainer just put it right into the
Tiy7i6uc960,294560,297440,pasta sauce and that way all of the
Tiy7i6uc960,297440,299680,pasta sauce gets absorbed into the pasta
Tiy7i6uc960,299680,301840,and it really flavors it very often what
Tiy7i6uc960,301840,304320,we do is we serve pasta and then we put
Tiy7i6uc960,304320,306400,the sauce on top and it just kind of
Tiy7i6uc960,306400,308560,sits on the top but this way it cooks
Tiy7i6uc960,308560,311120,into it and a little bit of the starch
Tiy7i6uc960,311120,313199,from the pasta really thickens the sauce
Tiy7i6uc960,313199,316320,so the two elements really work together
Tiy7i6uc960,316320,318880,so that's all the pasta
Tiy7i6uc960,318880,321360,just give it a big stir
Tiy7i6uc960,321360,323199,i'm just going to cook this all together
Tiy7i6uc960,323199,326160,oh man overboard
Tiy7i6uc960,326160,327440,it's going to cook together for two
Tiy7i6uc960,327440,329360,minutes the pasta will be perfectly
Tiy7i6uc960,329360,331199,cooked and the sauce will be just really
Tiy7i6uc960,331199,333280,silken and delicious
Tiy7i6uc960,333280,335680,i can really smell the garlic but it's
Tiy7i6uc960,335680,338720,like soft not sharp
Tiy7i6uc960,338720,340080,in the meantime while that cooks i'm
Tiy7i6uc960,340080,341840,going to julienne a little more basil
Tiy7i6uc960,341840,344240,for garnish
Tiy7i6uc960,344240,346160,i love pastas because you can make the
Tiy7i6uc960,346160,349039,sauce in advance just cook the pasta
Tiy7i6uc960,349039,350560,cook it together and you've got a
Tiy7i6uc960,350560,353280,fabulous dinner big salad
Tiy7i6uc960,353280,355520,i'm a happy camper
Tiy7i6uc960,355520,358800,okay so clear the decks
Tiy7i6uc960,358800,361680,need a big bowl
Tiy7i6uc960,363680,366400,and the pasta should be done this looks
Tiy7i6uc960,366400,368240,gorgeous and you can really tell that
Tiy7i6uc960,368240,369600,the tomato sauce has gotten into the
Tiy7i6uc960,369600,372080,pasta
Tiy7i6uc960,376160,377199,who wouldn't want to have this for
Tiy7i6uc960,377199,380199,dinner
Tiy7i6uc960,382240,384639,a little fresh basil on top
Tiy7i6uc960,384639,386800,and lots of freshly grated parmesan
Tiy7i6uc960,386800,388240,actually i call it grated parmesan but
Tiy7i6uc960,388240,390240,it's really ground i grind it in a food
Tiy7i6uc960,390240,391759,processor just because i like that kind
Tiy7i6uc960,391759,395199,of grainy texture of it a fork
Tiy7i6uc960,395199,397039,this is the kind of dinner anybody in
Tiy7i6uc960,397039,399120,the family would love it's just not your
Tiy7i6uc960,399120,401280,ordinary tomato sauce this is pasta
Tiy7i6uc960,401280,404479,arabiata with 24 cloves of garlic it
Tiy7i6uc960,404479,407440,smells amazing
Tiy7i6uc960,407440,408560,mmm
