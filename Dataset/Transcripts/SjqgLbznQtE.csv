SjqgLbznQtE,0,1760,this new series is thanks to everyone
SjqgLbznQtE,1760,3760,who's asked for budget edc and tech
SjqgLbznQtE,3760,4960,accessories
SjqgLbznQtE,4960,6240,unfortunately
SjqgLbznQtE,6240,7680,this ain't it
SjqgLbznQtE,7680,10000,yet unless you're balling out because
SjqgLbznQtE,10000,12320,this month's theme is best accessories
SjqgLbznQtE,12320,14000,under 75
SjqgLbznQtE,14000,17920,so let's check it out
SjqgLbznQtE,18080,20400,after 30 years of living i found the
SjqgLbznQtE,20400,22240,perfect solution to this if you're like
SjqgLbznQtE,22240,25519,me you carry a few cards id credit maybe
SjqgLbznQtE,25519,27680,transit a few keys to the several homes
SjqgLbznQtE,27680,29920,you own and these damn door fobs you
SjqgLbznQtE,29920,31679,have to carry with you to get into
SjqgLbznQtE,31679,34640,anywhere safely now back in 2021 you had
SjqgLbznQtE,34640,37200,to carry a wallet and a keychain that's
SjqgLbznQtE,37200,39520,like so retro thankfully that's where
SjqgLbznQtE,39520,42160,this frenchy co speed key saves the day
SjqgLbznQtE,42160,44079,mainly made of an eco-friendly italian
SjqgLbznQtE,44079,46000,leather with a structured frame built
SjqgLbznQtE,46000,48320,into it it's the minimalist dream wallet
SjqgLbznQtE,48320,50000,that you didn't know you needed i've
SjqgLbznQtE,50000,51600,personally used it for several months
SjqgLbznQtE,51600,54160,now and i will admit it's so close to
SjqgLbznQtE,54160,56239,perfect if it weren't for these terrible
SjqgLbznQtE,56239,58480,screws otherwise the whole design is
SjqgLbznQtE,58480,60640,super functional without sacrificing on
SjqgLbznQtE,60640,62480,aesthetics the rigid base makes storm
SjqgLbznQtE,62480,64400,keys actually usable combined with the
SjqgLbznQtE,64400,66560,plastic shell so your keys don't ruin
SjqgLbznQtE,66560,68400,everything and finishing it off with
SjqgLbznQtE,68400,70000,this surprisingly durable sheet of
SjqgLbznQtE,70000,72080,leather to clean it all up unfortunately
SjqgLbznQtE,72080,73920,all that goodness only to have these
SjqgLbznQtE,73920,75840,damn screws ruin the whole experience
SjqgLbznQtE,75840,77600,fortunately it's not a deal breaker
SjqgLbznQtE,77600,79759,unless you have like really tiny thumbs
SjqgLbznQtE,79759,81680,but using a pair of pliers to tighten
SjqgLbznQtE,81680,83840,them down does the job and allows you to
SjqgLbznQtE,83840,85680,finally say you know how to use a power
SjqgLbznQtE,85680,87439,tool once screwed in place though you're
SjqgLbznQtE,87439,90079,ready to roll hidden silent yet still
SjqgLbznQtE,90079,92159,easily accessible however the true
SjqgLbznQtE,92159,94560,benefit is this never having to buy
SjqgLbznQtE,94560,96400,extra pockets to store your keys and
SjqgLbznQtE,96400,98240,phone in separately anymore they can
SjqgLbznQtE,98240,99840,make all the love they want without
SjqgLbznQtE,99840,102320,leaving any scars behind physically or
SjqgLbznQtE,102320,104640,emotionally and yeah i'm even able to
SjqgLbznQtE,104640,106720,fit those damn key fobs in as well never
SjqgLbznQtE,106720,109040,having to even remove them to use as i
SjqgLbznQtE,109040,110799,can tap each side independently
SjqgLbznQtE,110799,112799,depending on where i am and thanks to
SjqgLbznQtE,112799,114640,the clever cutouts and stiff plastic
SjqgLbznQtE,114640,116799,frame you can single-handedly jam your
SjqgLbznQtE,116799,118560,doorknob while holding your mocha frappe
SjqgLbznQtE,118560,120159,in the other hand of course that's only
SjqgLbznQtE,120159,121920,half the fun with a single pocket
SjqgLbznQtE,121920,123759,designed for two cards on the other side
SjqgLbznQtE,123759,125439,and while i don't recommend stretching
SjqgLbznQtE,125439,127040,it too much i'm actually able to
SjqgLbznQtE,127040,129360,comfortably fit four cards inside after
SjqgLbznQtE,129360,130879,several months of breaking it in
SjqgLbznQtE,130879,132400,everything stays snug with a giant
SjqgLbznQtE,132400,134080,cutout on the bottom to slip your finger
SjqgLbznQtE,134080,136160,through and access your subway gift card
SjqgLbznQtE,136160,138160,on the fly all that in a sleek and
SjqgLbznQtE,138160,139599,simple looking wallet that doesn't
SjqgLbznQtE,139599,141760,scream it's some spy gadget but still
SjqgLbznQtE,141760,143520,withstanding quite a bit of back pocket
SjqgLbznQtE,143520,145520,abuse like it was designed to handle
SjqgLbznQtE,145520,147840,your dad's jeans and to think replacing
SjqgLbznQtE,147840,150239,two items for one and still being just
SjqgLbznQtE,150239,152720,as thin as your phone mind blown this
SjqgLbznQtE,152720,154319,next one is from the partner of the
SjqgLbznQtE,154319,157200,video caseify and their new impact cases
SjqgLbznQtE,157200,159440,for the samsung z flip 3 which adds to
SjqgLbznQtE,159440,161360,the line of their already insanely
SjqgLbznQtE,161360,163840,protective cases we've tested before but
SjqgLbznQtE,163840,166080,don't worry even when split in half it's
SjqgLbznQtE,166080,168640,still past my drop test no problemo more
SjqgLbznQtE,168640,170879,details on that in a bit because first
SjqgLbznQtE,170879,172879,things first taking a look at the case
SjqgLbznQtE,172879,175200,itself let's pop in an actual z flip
SjqgLbznQtE,175200,177920,three wa-bam the edges smoothly snap in
SjqgLbznQtE,177920,180239,place and for being two separate pieces
SjqgLbznQtE,180239,182159,it stays fairly snug for the most part
SjqgLbznQtE,182159,183599,but if you're really worried about your
SjqgLbznQtE,183599,185440,butterfingers they do include these
SjqgLbznQtE,185440,187519,stickers to ensure the case ain't going
SjqgLbznQtE,187519,189519,anywhere plus you'll never forget it's a
SjqgLbznQtE,189519,191360,case stifle case with their signature
SjqgLbznQtE,191360,193519,black ring around the camera that also
SjqgLbznQtE,193519,195360,doubles as added protection for those
SjqgLbznQtE,195360,197200,eyeballs keeping it slightly raised from
SjqgLbznQtE,197200,199040,licking your table while still providing
SjqgLbznQtE,199040,201280,plenty of access for your secret selfies
SjqgLbznQtE,201280,203360,it's also thin enough that you can still
SjqgLbznQtE,203360,205440,slow charge to your heart's content
SjqgLbznQtE,205440,206799,proper cutouts throughout the rest of
SjqgLbznQtE,206799,208640,the case and plenty of space for even
SjqgLbznQtE,208640,210640,the largest of thumbs to access the
SjqgLbznQtE,210640,212480,fingerprint reader but in the end what
SjqgLbznQtE,212480,215200,matters is how well this cute af case
SjqgLbznQtE,215200,217200,can actually keep your fancy folding
SjqgLbznQtE,217200,219360,phone protected so combining the
SjqgLbznQtE,219360,221680,hardback shell soft rubber edges with
SjqgLbznQtE,221680,224239,this goopy chi tech 2.0 shock absorbing
SjqgLbznQtE,224239,226319,gel on the inside and a generous lip
SjqgLbznQtE,226319,227760,around the front keeping the screen
SjqgLbznQtE,227760,230159,lifted when you decide to go ham i can
SjqgLbznQtE,230159,232159,confidently say their claims of handling
SjqgLbznQtE,232159,234319,drops of up to five feet for a folding
SjqgLbznQtE,234319,237360,phone well is true i did a few extra
SjqgLbznQtE,237360,239680,just to be safe and honestly it just
SjqgLbznQtE,239680,241360,feels good throwing an android around
SjqgLbznQtE,241360,243680,because i knew the case could handle it
SjqgLbznQtE,243680,245760,everything is still working no scratches
SjqgLbznQtE,245760,248480,or dents anywhere but just to be sure
SjqgLbznQtE,248480,250400,yeah i recommend you leave the testing
SjqgLbznQtE,250400,252720,to me but just know it can handle being
SjqgLbznQtE,252720,254319,tossed across the room when you rage
SjqgLbznQtE,254319,256320,quit at candy crush again however case
SjqgLbznQtE,256320,258239,of i is also known for their unique
SjqgLbznQtE,258239,260799,designs and this series is no different
SjqgLbznQtE,260799,262240,offering collabs with artists
SjqgLbznQtE,262240,264479,customizable monograms and just their
SjqgLbznQtE,264479,266479,classic personalizable options but
SjqgLbznQtE,266479,268560,they've also got a full range of designs
SjqgLbznQtE,268560,270240,to choose from if none of that floats
SjqgLbznQtE,270240,272320,your boat finally as someone who hates
SjqgLbznQtE,272320,274240,touching public doorknobs the impact
SjqgLbznQtE,274240,276639,series includes an antimicrobial coating
SjqgLbznQtE,276639,279120,which eliminates 99 of bacteria and
SjqgLbznQtE,279120,280800,prevents it from sticking to the case in
SjqgLbznQtE,280800,282160,the first place combine that with the
SjqgLbznQtE,282160,285199,fact it's made with 65 recycled material
SjqgLbznQtE,285199,287360,you'll actually feel good about picking
SjqgLbznQtE,287360,289040,up this case better yet with so many
SjqgLbznQtE,289040,290400,designs to choose from go to
SjqgLbznQtE,290400,293759,casetify.com accessorize me for 15 off
SjqgLbznQtE,293759,295680,your order links in the description down
SjqgLbznQtE,295680,297919,below another two in one for the edc
SjqgLbznQtE,297919,299600,gearheads that love their flashlights
SjqgLbznQtE,299600,302160,and pens that they never seem to use
SjqgLbznQtE,302160,304479,this is the olight open 2 pen that if
SjqgLbznQtE,304479,306639,you haven't guessed has an led built
SjqgLbznQtE,306639,308320,into it thankfully it's not some
SjqgLbznQtE,308320,310160,gimmicky toy as it's built from an
SjqgLbznQtE,310160,312080,aluminum frame keeping it light yet
SjqgLbznQtE,312080,314320,durable and has the most fidgety pen
SjqgLbznQtE,314320,316320,clickers in a bolt action style
SjqgLbznQtE,316320,318320,unfortunately they use proprietary ink
SjqgLbznQtE,318320,320560,refills but i didn't have any issues
SjqgLbznQtE,320560,322400,designing my masterpieces with it it's
SjqgLbznQtE,322400,325120,smooth didn't bleed and had a consistent
SjqgLbznQtE,325120,327120,flow however that's only half the story
SjqgLbznQtE,327120,330240,because up top is a 120 lumen led it
SjqgLbznQtE,330240,332240,utilizes a click and hold action to
SjqgLbznQtE,332240,333520,shuffle through the four brightness
SjqgLbznQtE,333520,335199,levels and while it won't replace the
SjqgLbznQtE,335199,337360,sun it does make for a perfect work
SjqgLbznQtE,337360,339120,light in a pinch especially when you
SjqgLbznQtE,339120,341280,consider it splits in two allowing you
SjqgLbznQtE,341280,343520,to still fill in your diary while hiding
SjqgLbznQtE,343520,344880,under the sheets but thanks to the
SjqgLbznQtE,344880,346639,built-in clip it also doubles as a
SjqgLbznQtE,346639,348400,useful hands-free light when sneaking
SjqgLbznQtE,348400,351039,around incognito mode thankfully it is
SjqgLbznQtE,351039,354560,rechargeable via usbc because it's 2022
SjqgLbznQtE,354560,356720,and it's completely waterproof something
SjqgLbznQtE,356720,358720,i didn't know i needed in a pen which
SjqgLbznQtE,358720,360639,makes it one of the best edc pens to
SjqgLbznQtE,360639,362639,have with you at all times as you don't
SjqgLbznQtE,362639,364479,have to worry about smacking it around
SjqgLbznQtE,364479,366400,anymore the etched in design does offer
SjqgLbznQtE,366400,368479,a bit of grip nothing groundbreaking but
SjqgLbznQtE,368479,370880,it does give a cool vortex bullet-like
SjqgLbznQtE,370880,372639,vibe it does include an additional ink
SjqgLbznQtE,372639,374400,refill and in case you haven't bought
SjqgLbznQtE,374400,376400,any electronics in the last eight years
SjqgLbznQtE,376400,378880,don't worry its own usb-c cable as well
SjqgLbznQtE,378880,380960,i'll be the first to admit a pry bar
SjqgLbznQtE,380960,383360,isn't my typical edc but they call the
SjqgLbznQtE,383360,386319,wesson mt a modern swiss army knife and
SjqgLbznQtE,386319,388560,given how much it can do in just a metal
SjqgLbznQtE,388560,390960,frame i'd have to agree made of a single
SjqgLbznQtE,390960,393039,piece of titanium it can take whatever
SjqgLbznQtE,393039,394639,beating you throw at it even after
SjqgLbznQtE,394639,396400,midnight that being said don't let its
SjqgLbznQtE,396400,398080,simple wireframe design fool you the
SjqgLbznQtE,398080,400479,fact it's lacking substance is a benefit
SjqgLbznQtE,400479,402240,making it lighter and surprisingly more
SjqgLbznQtE,402240,403759,grippy great for when you need to use
SjqgLbznQtE,403759,405520,the included flathead to tighten any
SjqgLbznQtE,405520,407600,loose screws or use the bottle opener
SjqgLbznQtE,407600,410080,because is it really a edc tool if it
SjqgLbznQtE,410080,411680,didn't have a bottle opener but the
SjqgLbznQtE,411680,413360,bread and butter is the bottom half of
SjqgLbznQtE,413360,415599,it with its sloped finish it makes for a
SjqgLbznQtE,415599,417840,super useful scraper that i find myself
SjqgLbznQtE,417840,420479,using on every video shoot and also just
SjqgLbznQtE,420479,423039,a tough pry bar so i never have to ruin
SjqgLbznQtE,423039,425120,my manicure again all that though and
SjqgLbznQtE,425120,427039,what feels like is lighter than my house
SjqgLbznQtE,427039,429440,key which is perfect because it blends
SjqgLbznQtE,429440,431199,right into them as well with its open
SjqgLbznQtE,431199,433520,body design it's basically one large
SjqgLbznQtE,433520,435440,oddly shaped keyring that allows you to
SjqgLbznQtE,435440,437520,access any of the tools with just a
SjqgLbznQtE,437520,439360,simple flick of the wrist now this is
SjqgLbznQtE,439360,441440,the funnest edc and tech combo i've
SjqgLbznQtE,441440,443440,tested in a long time for anyone that's
SjqgLbznQtE,443440,445280,ever wanted to solve a rubik's cube on
SjqgLbznQtE,445280,447039,their own and can just throw money at
SjqgLbznQtE,447039,448639,something to figure it out there's the
SjqgLbznQtE,448639,451199,gocube basically a smart rubik's cube
SjqgLbznQtE,451199,452720,mainly because you connect it to your
SjqgLbznQtE,452720,455440,phone and access a wide range of games
SjqgLbznQtE,455440,457840,challenges and of course a built-in
SjqgLbznQtE,457840,460000,solver taking you step by step tracking
SjqgLbznQtE,460000,462880,your every move until wa-bam now you
SjqgLbznQtE,462880,465039,know money can value happiness the
SjqgLbznQtE,465039,467280,companion app is a must as it tracks
SjqgLbznQtE,467280,469280,your stats as you progress basically
SjqgLbznQtE,469280,471360,like a workout tracker but for your
SjqgLbznQtE,471360,473680,fingers and your mind the coolest part
SjqgLbznQtE,473680,475440,though is it also tracks the cube's
SjqgLbznQtE,475440,477680,movement in real time so no matter how
SjqgLbznQtE,477680,479680,bad you mess up he'll always know how to
SjqgLbznQtE,479680,481919,take you home one spin at a time however
SjqgLbznQtE,481919,484160,with patience and a few youtube videos
SjqgLbznQtE,484160,485759,you could probably learn how to solve it
SjqgLbznQtE,485759,487599,on your own what makes the gocube stand
SjqgLbznQtE,487599,489680,out and actually useful is once you take
SjqgLbznQtE,489680,491039,the time to go through their learning
SjqgLbznQtE,491039,493280,academy they offer a range of other fun
SjqgLbznQtE,493280,495039,features like being able to challenge
SjqgLbznQtE,495039,497440,others around the world to test your big
SjqgLbznQtE,497440,499360,brain energy but if you can't afford
SjqgLbznQtE,499360,501759,wi-fi they also have a range of offline
SjqgLbznQtE,501759,504479,games like playing a piano with a
SjqgLbznQtE,504479,506160,rubik's cube the cube itself is
SjqgLbznQtE,506160,507759,comfortable thanks to the rounded edges
SjqgLbznQtE,507759,509520,and corners not your official tournament
SjqgLbznQtE,509520,511120,style design but definitely more
SjqgLbznQtE,511120,513200,approachable for beginners it also feels
SjqgLbznQtE,513200,515120,fairly sturdy with each spin snapping
SjqgLbznQtE,515120,517120,into place perfectly and every square is
SjqgLbznQtE,517120,519120,staying snug in its frame so it can
SjqgLbznQtE,519120,520880,easily handle your failure and
SjqgLbznQtE,520880,522719,ragequitting the battery life is rated
SjqgLbznQtE,522719,525040,for 60 hours but the included charger
SjqgLbznQtE,525040,526800,comes with a cool stand that you just
SjqgLbznQtE,526800,528880,simply pop it into making it easy to
SjqgLbznQtE,528880,530560,pull out and show off how much money you
