2fOWFfpLYW0,84400,87430,It's hard but it also has kind of a layer
2fOWFfpLYW0,87430,90360,of a slippery sludge on it.
2fOWFfpLYW0,90360,92680,It helps keep all the parasites away.

2fOWFfpLYW0,255000,257690,Whoever drew that is a good artist.
2fOWFfpLYW0,257690,260320,It shows the different parts of a shark.
2fOWFfpLYW0,260320,261153,Yeah.
2fOWFfpLYW0,261153,262114,Like the gills.

2fOWFfpLYW0,282300,283133,Look!
2fOWFfpLYW0,289466,293205,"Whoa, so why is she holding a fish on a pole?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,293205,295819,- So that's how we get the food down to our sharks.
2fOWFfpLYW0,295820,298060,"It's a very glow in the water column,"
2fOWFfpLYW0,298060,299557,she needs to have a really long tool
2fOWFfpLYW0,299557,302030,to get the food down to their mouths.
2fOWFfpLYW0,302030,303030,- Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,303030,306530,So they hold the pole which has a fish on the end
2fOWFfpLYW0,306530,310506,and then the sharks come up and have some supper.
2fOWFfpLYW0,310506,311339,(Blippi chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,311339,313136,"Oh, this looks like fun."

2fOWFfpLYW0,315913,318580,How big is that fish that she's feeding the sharks?
2fOWFfpLYW0,318580,321845,"- It's about this big, it's called a Blue Fish."
2fOWFfpLYW0,321845,324306,Because it has a kind of blue tint to it.
2fOWFfpLYW0,324306,326420,"- Okay, that's a Blue Fish"
2fOWFfpLYW0,326420,328200,and it's about this big.
2fOWFfpLYW0,328200,331650,So what kind of fish did I bring up?
2fOWFfpLYW0,331650,334580,"- So you brought up some Herring,"
2fOWFfpLYW0,334580,336580,which is the big fish in here.
2fOWFfpLYW0,336580,337413,- Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,337413,340867,"- And then, some capelin, which is the little fish in here."

2fOWFfpLYW0,352736,353569,- Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,353569,355277,- Just make sure you have your gloves on
2fOWFfpLYW0,355277,356976,'cause the fish can be kind of stinky.
2fOWFfpLYW0,356976,357995,(both chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,357995,359100,- Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,359100,360260,Let's put the glove on
2fOWFfpLYW0,360260,363703,so then my hands don't smell like fish for weeks.
2fOWFfpLYW0,364560,366040,"Okay, all right."
2fOWFfpLYW0,366040,367160,I've got my gloves on.
2fOWFfpLYW0,367160,369230,"Ah, oh, there we go."

2fOWFfpLYW0,371453,372980,"All right, now what do I do?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,372980,375310,- So we'll just take this fish bucket
2fOWFfpLYW0,375310,376990,that you brought up from the kitchen
2fOWFfpLYW0,376990,378611,and we'll head over here.
2fOWFfpLYW0,378611,380111,"- Okay, all right."
2fOWFfpLYW0,382843,383676,Alrighty.
2fOWFfpLYW0,383676,386340,- We'll head over to our feeding platform.
2fOWFfpLYW0,386340,387773,- Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,387773,391243,"- As soon as we walk up, the fish will be all ready for us."

2fOWFfpLYW0,613020,615340,"Since we just touched some animals,"
2fOWFfpLYW0,615340,619070,I think we should use this restroom and wash our hands.
2fOWFfpLYW0,619070,620213,Let's go!
2fOWFfpLYW0,621785,624670,"Okay, welcome to the bathroom."
2fOWFfpLYW0,624670,627483,"Whoa, look, whoa!"
2fOWFfpLYW0,629413,632263,"Look, this restroom is underwater."
2fOWFfpLYW0,633120,637573,And this restroom actually won the Best Restroom in America.
2fOWFfpLYW0,638530,640880,"Whoa, you can wash your hands right here"
2fOWFfpLYW0,640880,644550,"and look at shark, sharks and fish!"
2fOWFfpLYW0,644550,647403,"Whoa, this is awesome."
2fOWFfpLYW0,649300,650500,Pretty cool.
2fOWFfpLYW0,650500,654310,"All right, I washed my hands now I'll go dry 'em."
2fOWFfpLYW0,654310,656953,You enjoy the view.
2fOWFfpLYW0,656953,659453,(happy music)
2fOWFfpLYW0,663991,665199,(joyful music)
2fOWFfpLYW0,665199,668620,"Whoa, hey, let's go down the escalator"
2fOWFfpLYW0,668620,671305,to the deep ocean.
2fOWFfpLYW0,671305,672138,(Blippi chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,672138,672971,Come on.
2fOWFfpLYW0,674191,676941,(water bubbling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,686540,688920,"Whoa, look."
2fOWFfpLYW0,688920,691339,Now it's like we're underwater.
2fOWFfpLYW0,691340,692343,Look this way.
2fOWFfpLYW0,696663,697697,(Blippi chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,697697,699280,"Oh, that's awesome."
2fOWFfpLYW0,705425,708842,"I present to you, the Deep Ocean Exhibit!"
2fOWFfpLYW0,718593,722181,(Blippi chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,722181,723641,(happy music)
2fOWFfpLYW0,723641,726803,"Whoa, hey, what you doing up there?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,726803,728303,Come on down here.
2fOWFfpLYW0,731863,732696,Whoa.
2fOWFfpLYW0,734340,735911,"Hey, look."
2fOWFfpLYW0,735911,737293,Hello.
2fOWFfpLYW0,737293,739060,Hey.
2fOWFfpLYW0,739060,741743,So this is a Sea Lion.
2fOWFfpLYW0,743550,745173,There's another one over here.
2fOWFfpLYW0,746435,748793,"Whoa, it's so big."
2fOWFfpLYW0,748793,749626,Whoa.
2fOWFfpLYW0,750541,751374,(Blippi chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,751374,752680,That's so cool.
2fOWFfpLYW0,752680,754200,"Oh, look, look, look."
2fOWFfpLYW0,754200,758233,"Whoa, hello!"
2fOWFfpLYW0,758233,759136,Whoa.
2fOWFfpLYW0,759137,762290,And there's actually a Seal in here as well.
2fOWFfpLYW0,762290,763652,Let's go try and find it.
2fOWFfpLYW0,766910,768660,"Oh, let's see."
2fOWFfpLYW0,768660,769553,"Oh, here it is."
2fOWFfpLYW0,774430,775750,Hello.
2fOWFfpLYW0,775750,780705,"See that right here, this is a Seal."
2fOWFfpLYW0,780705,782200,Hi.
2fOWFfpLYW0,782200,787103,So there's three Sea Lions in here and one Seal.
2fOWFfpLYW0,787944,791720,"And the easiest way to tell the difference is this,"
2fOWFfpLYW0,791720,792939,I'll show you.
2fOWFfpLYW0,792940,797453,"So if you're a Sea Lion, you use your front flippers"
2fOWFfpLYW0,797453,799683,to basically walk like this.
2fOWFfpLYW0,801179,803227,(Sea Lion barking)
2fOWFfpLYW0,803227,804060,(Blippi chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,804060,806590,But Seals don't do that.
2fOWFfpLYW0,806590,808276,Seals...
2fOWFfpLYW0,808276,809109,"Oh, hello?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,810090,812340,"Oh, you're curious, huh?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,812340,813920,So curious.
2fOWFfpLYW0,813920,816230,"Oh, so that's a Sea Lion."
2fOWFfpLYW0,816230,819308,So it walks with its flippers.
2fOWFfpLYW0,819308,820790,(hands slapping)
2fOWFfpLYW0,820790,822959,"Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello."
2fOWFfpLYW0,822960,825590,They're actually really smart animals.
2fOWFfpLYW0,825590,827730,See how it's following me?
2fOWFfpLYW0,827730,829800,I'll try and change directions.
2fOWFfpLYW0,829800,830633,Whoa.
2fOWFfpLYW0,831470,835189,"Okay and Seals, they don't walk like that."
2fOWFfpLYW0,835190,837223,"You know, this is a Sea Lion."
2fOWFfpLYW0,840430,841399,Sea Lion
2fOWFfpLYW0,843140,847487,"and a Seal, they don't have that much power right here"
2fOWFfpLYW0,847487,849660,and it's kind of short and stubby.
2fOWFfpLYW0,849660,851162,So this is what they do.
2fOWFfpLYW0,853799,856920,(Blippi chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,856920,858592,So they just go to waddle.
2fOWFfpLYW0,860530,861930,That's silly.
2fOWFfpLYW0,861930,864740,"Wow, what magnificent creatures."
2fOWFfpLYW0,864740,866339,Check 'em out a little bit more.
2fOWFfpLYW0,876043,877682,(upbeat music)
2fOWFfpLYW0,877682,880684,"Whoa, penguins?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,880684,884020,"Yeah, we're behind the scene at the aquarium"
2fOWFfpLYW0,884020,885790,and we're gonna meet some penguins.
2fOWFfpLYW0,885790,886693,Come on.
2fOWFfpLYW0,889228,892410,"Okay, let's walk nice and slow"
2fOWFfpLYW0,892410,895433,and we'll be very quiet as well.
2fOWFfpLYW0,896370,897243,Whoa.
2fOWFfpLYW0,897243,898097,- Hi - Hey.
2fOWFfpLYW0,898097,899060,Who are you?
2fOWFfpLYW0,899060,899893,- I'm Hutch.
2fOWFfpLYW0,899893,901410,"- Ooh, this is Hutch."
2fOWFfpLYW0,901410,903120,Hey and what do you do here?
2fOWFfpLYW0,903120,905487,- I work with the penguins and reptiles.
2fOWFfpLYW0,905487,908250,"- Ooh, the penguins and the reptiles."
2fOWFfpLYW0,908250,911305,"Oh, do you see the penguins back there?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,911305,912373,Whoa!
2fOWFfpLYW0,912374,913297,Hello.
2fOWFfpLYW0,913297,915800,Are these your only two penguins here?
2fOWFfpLYW0,915800,918190,"- Oh, no we have more friends that are coming."
2fOWFfpLYW0,918190,919280,"Would you like to grab a toy,"
2fOWFfpLYW0,919280,920710,we're actually gonna play with them.
2fOWFfpLYW0,920710,921840,- Sure.
2fOWFfpLYW0,921840,923160,"'Kay, let's grab a toy"
2fOWFfpLYW0,923160,925483,and let's see some more penguins.
2fOWFfpLYW0,926507,929385,Look over there!
2fOWFfpLYW0,929385,932302,(penguins gakking)
2fOWFfpLYW0,939968,941297,- [Hutch] Keep moving.
2fOWFfpLYW0,941297,944660,Freely like a lot of movement with their toys.
2fOWFfpLYW0,944660,945493,So we have--
2fOWFfpLYW0,946487,947441,- Hello.
2fOWFfpLYW0,947441,949170,- He's already come over to say hi.
2fOWFfpLYW0,949170,952329,"- It looks like it's enjoying my shadow, huh?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,952330,953290,- That does happen.
2fOWFfpLYW0,953290,957199,So penguins are really light contrasting colors.
2fOWFfpLYW0,957200,959300,They also can see colors really well
2fOWFfpLYW0,959300,962519,"and have rods and cones in their eyes, just like we do."
2fOWFfpLYW0,962520,963599,- Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,963599,965730,"They're kind of, although they're birds,"
2fOWFfpLYW0,965730,969029,"they're kind of acting like kitty cats, huh?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,969030,969870,- Just a little bit.
2fOWFfpLYW0,969870,973620,They do like to play with a lot of different types of toys
2fOWFfpLYW0,973620,975610,"and just like kitty cats,"
2fOWFfpLYW0,975610,977990,they tell us when they wanna be touched.
2fOWFfpLYW0,977990,979250,- Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,979250,980093,"Ah, interesting."
2fOWFfpLYW0,980093,982300,This is pretty cool.
2fOWFfpLYW0,982300,983583,"Hey, get a closer look."
2fOWFfpLYW0,985256,990019,"Oh, bye-bye."
2fOWFfpLYW0,990020,991500,Penguins are so silly.
2fOWFfpLYW0,991500,993730,So where are these penguins from?
2fOWFfpLYW0,993730,996378,- These penguins are from South Africa.
2fOWFfpLYW0,996378,997211,- Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,997211,1000552,- And we have 32 of them here at the aquarium.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1000552,1002650,"- Wow, 32 penguins here."
2fOWFfpLYW0,1002650,1004503,And these are from South Africa?
2fOWFfpLYW0,1005819,1007496,Not Antarctica?
2fOWFfpLYW0,1007497,1010450,"- Not Antarctica, they're actually one"
2fOWFfpLYW0,1010450,1014350,of several species of penguins that prefer the warm climate.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1014350,1016819,"- Oh, okay."
2fOWFfpLYW0,1016820,1017653,That's pretty cool.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1017653,1018486,Interesting.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1018486,1020380,Warm climate and penguins.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1020380,1022713,I guess you learn something every day.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1024520,1027400,"Hey, let's take a seat right over here."
2fOWFfpLYW0,1027400,1030560,And then Hutch is gonna bring a penguin over.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1030560,1032459,"Ooh, I'm so excited."
2fOWFfpLYW0,1032459,1034132,I get to touch a penguin.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1035290,1037541,"Ooh, hello?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,1037541,1038473,(Blippi chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,1038473,1039306,Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1039306,1042980,"So I'm gonna touch the penguin with two fingers,"
2fOWFfpLYW0,1042980,1045530,gently on its back.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1045530,1047603,"Hey, are you ready?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,1051052,1051885,Oh.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1053699,1054532,Hey.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1057343,1059880,It felt so soft.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1059880,1064880,Did you know penguins have 70 feathers per square inch?
2fOWFfpLYW0,1065350,1068840,"Yeah, they're really small and really dense."
2fOWFfpLYW0,1068840,1069980,"Can I touch it again, Hutch?"
2fOWFfpLYW0,1069980,1071518,- Yes you can.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1071519,1072352,- Okay.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1075533,1077432,Does that feel good?
2fOWFfpLYW0,1077432,1078282,Do you like that?
2fOWFfpLYW0,1082480,1084077,- She's showing off for you.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1084077,1084910,- Ooh.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1086240,1088920,What does that mean when she shakes her head?
2fOWFfpLYW0,1088920,1091740,- So that means she's really happy
2fOWFfpLYW0,1091740,1094532,and you might be her new boyfriend.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1094532,1095365,- Ooh.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1098454,1100934,I hope she doesn't want a kiss.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1100935,1102364,(both chuckling)
2fOWFfpLYW0,1102364,1103767,"Oh, hello!"
2fOWFfpLYW0,1104740,1107420,This is a Little Blue penguin.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1107420,1108673,It's pretty small.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1109958,1114360,"Oh, this board has the sizes of different penguins."
2fOWFfpLYW0,1114360,1118953,"Oh, like the penguin I met today, an African Penguin."

2fOWFfpLYW0,1148940,1150632,"Whoa, look a Toucan."
2fOWFfpLYW0,1151792,1152692,You see it's beak?
2fOWFfpLYW0,1153610,1156480,Kind of looks like the shape of a banana.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1156480,1158650,A really colorful banana.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1158650,1160650,"There's another bird over here, come on."

2fOWFfpLYW0,1190114,1191870,"Whoa, look."
2fOWFfpLYW0,1191870,1193270,Look at this animal.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1193270,1195253,It's moving really slow.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1196390,1198073,Do you know what animal this is?
2fOWFfpLYW0,1200201,1202620,"Yeah, this is a Sloth."
2fOWFfpLYW0,1202620,1205166,Let's act like a sloth together.

2fOWFfpLYW0,1245960,1248299,Look at 'em go underwater.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1248300,1249560,Whoa!
2fOWFfpLYW0,1249560,1253760,I bet they can hold their breath for a really long time.

2fOWFfpLYW0,1256822,1258350,Whoa.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1258350,1261230,They kind of look like water cats.
2fOWFfpLYW0,1261230,1263455,But they're not kitty cats.

2fOWFfpLYW0,1287207,1290910,That was so much fun learning about all these creatures
2fOWFfpLYW0,1290910,1294360,"at OdySea in Scottsdale, Arizona with you."
