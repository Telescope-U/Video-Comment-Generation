JrBtNPnekUU,345590,351510,[Music]  it's not working
JrBtNPnekUU,351510,357680,[Music]  hi  did you know that humans like me and you

JrBtNPnekUU,364000,369520,like dogs i sweat  cat  also sweat
JrBtNPnekUU,369520,375440,and even cute little pandas get sweat  too  but
JrBtNPnekUU,375440,383120,why do we sweat  we sweat is because our body  is cooling itself off
JrBtNPnekUU,383120,389360,when we sweat it's our body's way of  regulating  our temperature
JrBtNPnekUU,389360,394880,for example  if we are working out and exercising
JrBtNPnekUU,394880,401039,our body temperature increases really  really really high and in order for our
JrBtNPnekUU,401039,407360,body to tolerate it so we don't overheat  our bodies releases little beads of
JrBtNPnekUU,407360,413680,sweat from your sweat glance in your  skin these sweat glands work really hard
JrBtNPnekUU,413680,420639,by pushing out water salts and other  minerals  once the sweat is on your skin it
JrBtNPnekUU,420639,426160,evaporates by the air this evaporation  helps cool you off
JrBtNPnekUU,426160,431360,pretty cool huh  i know what you're thinking why is sweat
JrBtNPnekUU,431360,436400,so stinky  well sweat doesn't have a smell until it
JrBtNPnekUU,436400,443520,mixes with bacteria in stinky places  like your feet  or your armpit
JrBtNPnekUU,443520,449520,phew  wow that's stinky all right  okay i need a shower
JrBtNPnekUU,449520,456400,i'll be back did you know that the  average human body  has between two
JrBtNPnekUU,456400,464639,and five million  sweat glands  that's a lot lot of sweats
JrBtNPnekUU,464639,470319,dogs sweat by panting  they breathe
JrBtNPnekUU,470319,476639,really  really hard and starts to drool like  that
JrBtNPnekUU,476720,484879,then the drool evaporates and they're  cool  cats sweat through their paw pads like
JrBtNPnekUU,484879,490960,this  just like when our hands and feet get  really really sweaty
JrBtNPnekUU,490960,500080,sometimes you can see the little cat's  paw print look  [Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,500080,505280,also there are some animals that don't  sweat like we do
JrBtNPnekUU,505280,512339,come on let's go check out some animals  that don't sweat  [Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,512800,520640,look  there's a rhino animals like rhino pigs  and hippos have to use mud
JrBtNPnekUU,520640,528640,or water  to keep themselves cool  they roll around in mud
JrBtNPnekUU,528640,533760,or hang out in water to keep their body  temperature down
JrBtNPnekUU,533760,541200,look at that cake over there  with all this learning i'm breaking a  sweat look
JrBtNPnekUU,542080,547680,now it's time to take a pop quiz  question number one
JrBtNPnekUU,547680,553920,why do we sweat is it because of a  we're sad
JrBtNPnekUU,555040,562080,or is it because of b  we forgot to do our homework oh no i  didn't do my homework
JrBtNPnekUU,562080,569120,or it's because of c  our body is cooling itself off
JrBtNPnekUU,569120,574839,the answer is c it's our body's way of  cooling
JrBtNPnekUU,574839,581680,itself question number two  why the sweat stinks is because of a it
JrBtNPnekUU,581680,588839,mixes with bacteria in places like our  feet  [Music]  and our armpits
JrBtNPnekUU,588839,594000,oh somebody needs a shower  is it because of b
JrBtNPnekUU,594000,601200,you have a pet dog  so cute  or it's because of c
JrBtNPnekUU,601200,609200,you did not eat your breakfast yet  the answer is  hey it's because it mixes with bacteria
JrBtNPnekUU,609200,615920,in places like our stinky feet  and our armpit  question number three
JrBtNPnekUU,615920,621360,how many sweat glands does an average  human body have
JrBtNPnekUU,621360,626640,is it a  two to five million sweat plants
JrBtNPnekUU,626640,633040,or is it b  only one sweat glance  or is it c
JrBtNPnekUU,633040,640240,trillions and trillions of sweat clouds  did you guys guess it it is a two to
JrBtNPnekUU,640240,645519,five million sweat glands are in a human  body
JrBtNPnekUU,645519,651760,wow we learned so much about why we  sweat  now let's go back into ryan all about it

JrBtNPnekUU,701200,707440,wait wait why do they eat me  good question ryan
JrBtNPnekUU,707440,713440,i'll explain it to you let's go guys  whoa
JrBtNPnekUU,713440,719519,hi everybody okay so did you guys know  that some plants have adapted to eat
JrBtNPnekUU,719519,725360,meat  these are called carnivorous plants  but why
JrBtNPnekUU,725360,733279,do they eat meat  these plants eat meat because they get  their nutrients from bugs and insects
JrBtNPnekUU,733279,739040,like those  i am not a fan of insects so i'm going  to get out of here
JrBtNPnekUU,739279,747200,the type of soil that these carnivorous  plants live in  don't give them enough nutrients
JrBtNPnekUU,747200,755600,so  they adapted to eat meat  check out this plant in real life
JrBtNPnekUU,755600,761680,this carnivorous plant is very very well  known can you guess what it is
JrBtNPnekUU,761680,767519,that's right it's the venus fly trap  look  wow
JrBtNPnekUU,767519,774000,so first a lot of these carnivorous  plants have this red color like that
JrBtNPnekUU,774000,780480,that helps attract insect to it  and the venus fly trap use these hair
JrBtNPnekUU,780480,786800,like pieces to smooth  shut whenever it feels something on its
JrBtNPnekUU,786800,793440,leave look  let's try this take both hands out put
JrBtNPnekUU,793440,800160,it together like this  and your little fingers are like the  little hair on the ends of the leaves of
JrBtNPnekUU,800160,805600,the venus fly trap  then when something finds its way in
JrBtNPnekUU,805600,813200,between the leaves  you  snap shut so that it can't escape see
JrBtNPnekUU,813200,818800,now pretend this stick right here is a  little insect we're going to touch the
JrBtNPnekUU,818800,826800,leaves of the venus flytrap and see what  happens okay all right  [Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,826800,834320,oh no a close shot look  i can't get out  wow that's so cool
JrBtNPnekUU,834320,839680,wow  that was fast and crazy look at this
JrBtNPnekUU,839680,845040,whoa  wow that was so interesting and crazy
JrBtNPnekUU,845040,850399,right  once the venus fly trap closed tight the
JrBtNPnekUU,850399,857839,insects can't get out because the hair  on the venus flytrap locks in place that
JrBtNPnekUU,857839,864800,makes the perfect track it only takes  the venus flytrap one second to close
JrBtNPnekUU,864800,873279,shut  and once it closes in on the inset the  venus fly trap use its digestive plants
JrBtNPnekUU,873279,878639,to break down its food and use it for  nutrients
JrBtNPnekUU,878639,883680,pretty cool right  so we learn all about the venus flag
JrBtNPnekUU,883680,891920,trap  but what about the other carnivorous  plants  there's butterworth pitcher plant
JrBtNPnekUU,891920,897639,and dressera  all of these plants have what looks like
JrBtNPnekUU,897639,904079,refreshing water droplets  or super yummy nectar
JrBtNPnekUU,904079,909120,but  don't let that fool you they only look  delicious
JrBtNPnekUU,909120,917040,but to insect they're dangerous humans  don't have to worry look we're too big
JrBtNPnekUU,917040,924880,whoa that are some crazy carnivorous  plants  but we learned so much about them so
JrBtNPnekUU,924880,933040,time for a quiz  question number one  why do some plants eat
JrBtNPnekUU,933040,939210,meat  a  they're so  bored
JrBtNPnekUU,939210,945120,[Music]  they're looking for a best friend
JrBtNPnekUU,945120,950399,or is it c  they get their nutrients from bugs and
JrBtNPnekUU,950399,955680,insect  the answer to why do these plants eat
JrBtNPnekUU,955680,962240,meat is because  see  they get their nutrients from bugs
JrBtNPnekUU,962240,970399,and insects  question number two  what color attracts the insect to the
JrBtNPnekUU,970399,975440,venus flytrap  is it a  blue
JrBtNPnekUU,975440,981120,is it b  red  or is it c
JrBtNPnekUU,981120,986160,periwinkle  so what color attracts the insect to the
JrBtNPnekUU,986160,993279,venus flytrap the answer is  b  red do you guys get it red
JrBtNPnekUU,993279,1003519,question number three how long does it  take the venus fly trap to snap close
JrBtNPnekUU,1003519,1012399,is it a  one second  or is it b 10 minutes
JrBtNPnekUU,1012399,1018399,or is it c  a whole hour  the answer is a
JrBtNPnekUU,1018399,1025839,it takes the venus fly trap one second  to snapchat
JrBtNPnekUU,1025839,1031839,that was so much fun i hope you guys  learned so much and get the answer right

JrBtNPnekUU,1506000,1512480,which planet in our solar system  that has life that we know of so far a
JrBtNPnekUU,1512480,1519200,is it mercury  b  is it mars
JrBtNPnekUU,1519200,1525919,c is it earth the planet we're living on  right now hint  or is it d
JrBtNPnekUU,1525919,1531600,jupiter the biggest planet  the answer is  sea
JrBtNPnekUU,1531600,1536720,earth did you get it right yay  earth is the only planet that we know of
JrBtNPnekUU,1536720,1543760,right now that has life how cool is that  right  question number two
JrBtNPnekUU,1543760,1550799,how many planets are there in our solar  system  a is it 60
JrBtNPnekUU,1550799,1557120,b is it 870  c is it eight which one
JrBtNPnekUU,1557120,1564799,and the answer is c  eight there's eight planets in our solar  system let's quickly name them again
JrBtNPnekUU,1564799,1570559,there's mercury  there's  venus
JrBtNPnekUU,1570559,1576240,and then there's earth  there's mars
JrBtNPnekUU,1576240,1582400,jupiter super big  saturn
JrBtNPnekUU,1582720,1587760,uranus  and neptune  did you get it
JrBtNPnekUU,1587760,1593520,last question number three  which planet in our solar system is the
JrBtNPnekUU,1593520,1599600,biggest do you remember  is it a  earth

JrBtNPnekUU,1605919,1611120,the moon  and the answer is
JrBtNPnekUU,1611120,1617520,b jupiter it's the biggest planet in our  solar system look how big it is don't
JrBtNPnekUU,1617520,1624799,come any closer so here  good job answering the pop quiz and if
JrBtNPnekUU,1624799,1631760,you didn't get it right just try again  next time  now that we know all about our planets
JrBtNPnekUU,1631760,1636158,let's go back and tell ryan okay let's  go
JrBtNPnekUU,1637200,1644840,okay guys i'm gonna go to planet mars to  find mommy where did she go
JrBtNPnekUU,1654680,1659930,[Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,1662799,1669039,so those are all the planets in our  solar system wait  ryan where'd he go
JrBtNPnekUU,1669039,1673720,did he go to outer space without me
JrBtNPnekUU,1677900,1680989,[Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,1694880,1697840,is
JrBtNPnekUU,1702000,1705000,oh
JrBtNPnekUU,1707670,1712210,[Music]  [Applause]
JrBtNPnekUU,1721600,1726960,what happened there's a tornado out  there tornado out there
JrBtNPnekUU,1727300,1730380,[Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,1734159,1741760,mommy how do tornados form  good question  how do tornadoes form i'll be right
JrBtNPnekUU,1741760,1747360,back  where did mommy go
JrBtNPnekUU,1747840,1755360,hi guys did you know that our tornado  can spin as fast as 300 miles per hour
JrBtNPnekUU,1755360,1762960,also our tornado can destroy buildings  power lines whoa look up there and
JrBtNPnekUU,1762960,1770240,uproot  a trees  is a rapidly rotating columns of air
JrBtNPnekUU,1770240,1776320,that forms during the storm  and connects with the ground through a
JrBtNPnekUU,1776320,1782960,funnel cloud  so now that we know what our tornado is  we need to know
JrBtNPnekUU,1782960,1788640,why they form  first we need a very very special kind
JrBtNPnekUU,1788640,1794559,of storm  can you guess what kind of storm  it's loud
JrBtNPnekUU,1794559,1800320,strong  and  they can be scary
JrBtNPnekUU,1800320,1808720,did you guess what kind of storm  that's right  a thunderstorm oh
JrBtNPnekUU,1808720,1816880,i'll be right back  but the kind of storm you need to  produce a tornado
JrBtNPnekUU,1816880,1826000,is called a supercell thunderstorm  that means it's a storm with rain
JrBtNPnekUU,1826000,1831039,hail  lightning  and
JrBtNPnekUU,1831039,1835879,fast wind wow
JrBtNPnekUU,1836880,1843279,why does a tornado form from a supercell  thunderstorm  it's because
JrBtNPnekUU,1843279,1851600,warm moist air meets cool dry air  and the winds direction change
JrBtNPnekUU,1851600,1859840,now let's check it out  first  we have warm air rising
JrBtNPnekUU,1859840,1866080,cool dry air sinks  it becomes a vortex or funnel
JrBtNPnekUU,1866080,1872799,where the inside is warm but the outside  is cold
JrBtNPnekUU,1872799,1879600,it gets stronger and stronger and it  spins faster and faster
JrBtNPnekUU,1879600,1886880,finally it touches the ground and it  becomes a tornado
JrBtNPnekUU,1886880,1894799,here it is hi  now for the fun part  what about we make our own tornado
JrBtNPnekUU,1894799,1900480,are you guys ready to create our own  tornado look at this whoa so we colored
JrBtNPnekUU,1900480,1905600,the water  blue to make it more interesting this is  heavy
JrBtNPnekUU,1905600,1913200,workout  okay  on a count of three we're gonna flip the  bottle over to see if the tornado formed
JrBtNPnekUU,1913200,1919398,ready one two three yeah
JrBtNPnekUU,1920080,1927120,no  what do you guys notice  what happened there's no tornado
JrBtNPnekUU,1927120,1933679,oh  do you guys know what we should do  what if we try to just swirl the water
JrBtNPnekUU,1933679,1936240,like so
JrBtNPnekUU,1939279,1944480,whoa what do you guys see now  do you see how as the water begins to
JrBtNPnekUU,1944480,1950799,move it creates energy  and it makes it flow downwards look at
JrBtNPnekUU,1950799,1958159,that  now that's a real tornado and as the  water flows down the air from the bottom
JrBtNPnekUU,1958159,1963360,bottle flows up to replace it  that was so much fun you ready to see it
JrBtNPnekUU,1963360,1969279,again  okay so what do we have to do  we have to shake it  whoa the water's spilling out but it's
JrBtNPnekUU,1969279,1977559,okay  whoa look at that tornado go
JrBtNPnekUU,1980010,1986209,[Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,1986399,1992720,wow that was so much fun making this  awesome tornado but now let's go and  meet a real
JrBtNPnekUU,1992720,1998320,live tornado let's go  so now we're outside and
JrBtNPnekUU,1998320,2004000,there's a giant storm happening behind  us do you guys see it
JrBtNPnekUU,2004000,2010080,there's some big clouds here  and it's getting  it's getting
JrBtNPnekUU,2010080,2016960,pretty windy  these are perfect condition for a
JrBtNPnekUU,2016960,2021919,a a  tornado
JrBtNPnekUU,2022320,2031200,i wonder if it's our nice tornado let's  see  hi mr tornado well howdy there uh wait
JrBtNPnekUU,2031200,2037679,what are you doing out here don't you  know how dangerous tornadoes are oh i'm  sorry i didn't know
JrBtNPnekUU,2037679,2045039,well i'll warn you a little bit about us  but you have to promise to keep yourself  safe if you ever see one of us again
JrBtNPnekUU,2045039,2052000,right okay  so what makes tornado so dangerous  well you see we spin
JrBtNPnekUU,2052000,2059040,really fast  300 miles per hour right you're  absolutely right some of us can spin
JrBtNPnekUU,2059040,2066000,that fast we're also unpredictable too  so what does that mean  that means we can pop out of the storm
JrBtNPnekUU,2066000,2071040,at any time at any place and it can be a  weak tornado or a strong one
JrBtNPnekUU,2071040,2078000,you don't know till you know you know so  what are we supposed to do if you have a
JrBtNPnekUU,2078000,2083679,basement get to it  if you don't  go to the lowest floor and find a safe
JrBtNPnekUU,2083679,2089358,place in your house that isn't close to  windows like a bathroom or a closet
JrBtNPnekUU,2089358,2095839,that's some good advice thank you  that's right so get on and get safe okay
JrBtNPnekUU,2095839,2103200,thank you so much mr tornado bye  so now that we know so much about
JrBtNPnekUU,2103200,2110480,tornado  let's take a quiz  question number one  what is your tornado
JrBtNPnekUU,2110480,2116400,is it a hurricane  is it  your best friend
JrBtNPnekUU,2116400,2124160,or  is it rapidly rotating columns of air  that connects a thunderstorm to the
JrBtNPnekUU,2124160,2131280,ground  that's right  a tornado is a rapidly rotating column
JrBtNPnekUU,2131280,2137599,of air that connects a thunderstorm  to the ground
JrBtNPnekUU,2137599,2142640,next question  why do tornadoes form
JrBtNPnekUU,2142640,2148640,is it because  warm moist air meets cool dry air and
JrBtNPnekUU,2148640,2154880,when direction changes  is it because they are late  for dinner
JrBtNPnekUU,2154880,2160560,or  is it because they're looking for their  money
JrBtNPnekUU,2160560,2168880,that's right a tornado forms because  warm moist air meets cool dry air
JrBtNPnekUU,2168880,2175200,and the wind direction changes  question three
JrBtNPnekUU,2175200,2180800,what should you do to stay safe from a  tornado  is it
JrBtNPnekUU,2180800,2188160,let's go to the basement or safe room on  the lowest level with no windows
JrBtNPnekUU,2188160,2193620,or  should we dance in the rain
JrBtNPnekUU,2193620,2202960,[Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,2202960,2208960,or  if there's a tornado should you just eat  some yummy candy and watch youtube
JrBtNPnekUU,2208960,2216160,videos  that's right if you see your tornado the  best way to stay safe is to go to the
JrBtNPnekUU,2216160,2222960,basement or a safe room on the lowest  level where there is no window
JrBtNPnekUU,2222960,2229359,great job now that we learned so much  about tornado  let's go back and tell ryan okay let's
JrBtNPnekUU,2229359,2235520,go  that's how our tornado is formed mommy
JrBtNPnekUU,2235520,2239240,what is that right there
JrBtNPnekUU,2247680,2252960,thank you for watching our tornado video  bye
JrBtNPnekUU,2253359,2258500,one more piece  [Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,2263359,2266359,oh
JrBtNPnekUU,2270400,2278160,whoa oh it's still shaking a little bit  i know that was a strong earthquake  mommy but what causes earthquakes good
JrBtNPnekUU,2278160,2285760,question what and what is an earthquake  right i'm gonna explain it to you okay  be right back whoa where'd mommy go wait
JrBtNPnekUU,2285760,2292800,what where what what  [Music]  hi there  did you know that earthquake means
JrBtNPnekUU,2292800,2298560,there's a sudden violent shaking  of the ground
JrBtNPnekUU,2298560,2307440,but  what makes the ground shake is it  because i'm jumping up and down
JrBtNPnekUU,2309200,2316640,or is it because the earth is growing  bigger  and bigger and bigger
JrBtNPnekUU,2318160,2325359,or is it because the earth is made of  plates that slide around on
JrBtNPnekUU,2325359,2330720,top of hot  molten magma
JrBtNPnekUU,2330720,2336160,yeah that's right  the earth is like this orange on the
JrBtNPnekUU,2336160,2341340,inside it's squishy and full of fluid
JrBtNPnekUU,2341340,2349200,[Music]  on the outside the orange peel is like  the earth's crust
JrBtNPnekUU,2350000,2355599,the earth's crust is broken up into what  we call tectonic plates
JrBtNPnekUU,2355599,2360960,whoa look they go back together  all along the cracks of the tectonic
JrBtNPnekUU,2360960,2367359,plates are where earthquake happens  [Music]  pretty cool huh
JrBtNPnekUU,2367359,2374240,did you know the place where earthquakes  happen are called sparks
JrBtNPnekUU,2374240,2380079,there are three different kinds of  faults that makes earthquake happens
JrBtNPnekUU,2380079,2387920,one  two  three  we are going to demonstrate how all
JrBtNPnekUU,2387920,2393920,these happens  are you ready  let's pretend these puddings are like
JrBtNPnekUU,2393920,2401440,the inside of the earth the pudding is  like the magma look how jiggly they are
JrBtNPnekUU,2401440,2408480,the rice krispie treats are like the  earth's crust  the first type of fault is a transform
JrBtNPnekUU,2408480,2414720,fault  this means that the plates  slide and slide past each other just
JrBtNPnekUU,2414720,2421119,like this  the second type of fault is called a  divergent fault this means that the
JrBtNPnekUU,2421119,2426240,plates pull away from each other look
JrBtNPnekUU,2426240,2431680,and the third type of fault is called a  convergent fault this means that the two
JrBtNPnekUU,2431680,2439599,plates push together whoa  this is how mountain and hills happen
JrBtNPnekUU,2439599,2447280,whoa  so those are the three kinds of faults  that cause earthquake
JrBtNPnekUU,2447280,2454720,what is that  whoa did you guys feel that that was a
JrBtNPnekUU,2454720,2461599,real earthquake  i wonder how big that one was  did you know that you can
JrBtNPnekUU,2461599,2468079,measure earthquakes they get score on  how strong they are
JrBtNPnekUU,2468079,2476480,and they go all the way to 10  on what is called the richter scale
JrBtNPnekUU,2476480,2482880,the bigger the number the stronger the  earthquake
JrBtNPnekUU,2482880,2488730,so  an earthquake that measures a 2.5
JrBtNPnekUU,2488730,2494560,[Music]  is smaller and it doesn't cause as much  damage
JrBtNPnekUU,2494560,2501839,but  an earthquake that measures an  8.5  wow
JrBtNPnekUU,2504400,2510880,whoa do you guys see  that's a lot of damage
JrBtNPnekUU,2510880,2519440,so now that we have all this amazing  knowledge on earthquake  it's time for a pop quiz are you ready
JrBtNPnekUU,2519440,2524480,question number one why do earthquake  happen
JrBtNPnekUU,2524480,2529359,a is it because the season change
JrBtNPnekUU,2529839,2536800,b  is it because the earth is so bored  or is it because see
JrBtNPnekUU,2536800,2543599,earth is made of plates that slide  around on top of hot
JrBtNPnekUU,2543599,2549680,molten  magma  that's right the answer is c earth is
JrBtNPnekUU,2549680,2557760,made of plates that slide around on  top of hot molten magma
JrBtNPnekUU,2557760,2563200,question number two  how many kinds of faults
JrBtNPnekUU,2563200,2569200,are there  a  is it 10
JrBtNPnekUU,2569280,2575440,b  are there three kinds of bots  or c
JrBtNPnekUU,2575440,2582079,a hundred type of faults  that's right the answer is b which is
JrBtNPnekUU,2582079,2590319,three  there are three kinds of faults  final question number three
JrBtNPnekUU,2590319,2596800,how big  does the richer scale go  a
JrBtNPnekUU,2596800,2603599,10  b  1  or c
JrBtNPnekUU,2603599,2610079,1 million  [Music]  that's right the answer is a which is
JrBtNPnekUU,2610079,2617359,ten the richer scale goes from one  all the way to ten
JrBtNPnekUU,2617359,2622960,yay good job you guys answered all the  question correct and if you didn't it's
JrBtNPnekUU,2622960,2629680,okay just try again good job thank you  for trying  now that we learned so much about
JrBtNPnekUU,2629680,2636480,earthquake  one is coming so i better go and tell  ryan okay
JrBtNPnekUU,2638240,2644400,okay all stable man  so ryan that's how earthquake happens
JrBtNPnekUU,2644400,2651200,that's very cool mommy i hope an  earthquake doesn't knock down the tower  wow this is huge and giant that's so
JrBtNPnekUU,2651200,2657519,cool ryan  oh hey guys hey whoa this is really
JrBtNPnekUU,2660839,2666480,cool right guys thank you for watching  daddy quick daddy quick i know

JrBtNPnekUU,2675880,2678979,[Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,2684160,2686318,it's
JrBtNPnekUU,2689200,2695680,oh raining it's raining a lot yeah but  do you know what happened after the rain
JrBtNPnekUU,2695680,2701119,a rainbow  but mommy how does a rainbow form
JrBtNPnekUU,2701119,2708560,good question i'm right  [Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,2708560,2714640,did you know that rainbows have seven  colors  there's green
JrBtNPnekUU,2714640,2720960,there's yellow  there's violet  there's red
JrBtNPnekUU,2720960,2727839,there's indigo  there's blue  and orange
JrBtNPnekUU,2727839,2734960,wow that's a lot of colors seven  what's wrong rainbow oh the rainbow

JrBtNPnekUU,2740560,2746000,i know it's in the wrong order  did you know that the colors of the
JrBtNPnekUU,2746000,2751420,rainbow are always in the same order  what is it again what is that order
JrBtNPnekUU,2751420,2756560,[Music]  it is roy  g
JrBtNPnekUU,2756560,2763119,biv  say it with me roy g biv  roy g biv

JrBtNPnekUU,2768960,2774640,r is for red  o is for orange y is for yellow
JrBtNPnekUU,2774640,2783280,g is for green  b is for blue  i is for indigo v is for violet roy g
JrBtNPnekUU,2783280,2792079,bib  roy g biz roy g biv roy g biz roy g big
JrBtNPnekUU,2792079,2798000,you got it that's it that's the order  roy g biv
JrBtNPnekUU,2798000,2804800,there we go another rainbow looks so  happy  so now we know the order and the color
JrBtNPnekUU,2804800,2810480,of the rainbow  but why  did the rainbow appear after the big
JrBtNPnekUU,2810480,2817079,storm  oh no i think a storm is coming i better  use my umbrella
JrBtNPnekUU,2817520,2821599,i better run inside the house i'll be  right back
JrBtNPnekUU,2822880,2829040,is the storm over  oh yeah it is yay  now let's see if we can find that
JrBtNPnekUU,2829040,2835760,rainbow where is the rainbow  there it is rainbow yeah look at this oh
JrBtNPnekUU,2835760,2843559,wait a minute this is not a real rainbow  this is just a pool float let's test it  out
JrBtNPnekUU,2845599,2852079,now this will be so much fun in the pool  so when a storm comes and it rains
JrBtNPnekUU,2852079,2860640,really hard it leaves water droplets in  the sky  these droplets refract which means bent
JrBtNPnekUU,2860640,2866880,light so when the sun shines white light  on the water droplet the light bends and
JrBtNPnekUU,2866880,2873119,we see all seven colors because they  bend at different angles red is first

JrBtNPnekUU,3104880,3111440,hi there  did you know that the first earthling  that orbits the earth
JrBtNPnekUU,3111440,3118400,was a dog wow  humans didn't get to go into space until
JrBtNPnekUU,3118400,3124559,four years later  and when humans did go into space they
JrBtNPnekUU,3124559,3131760,knew they needed  spacesuits  but why do we need spacesuits
JrBtNPnekUU,3131760,3136880,because the atmosphere in space  is different
JrBtNPnekUU,3136880,3145680,than earth  base can be too cold  when you're far away from the sun
JrBtNPnekUU,3148319,3153520,and  too hot when you're too close to the sun
JrBtNPnekUU,3153520,3160240,oh  awesome  there's no  there's no air in space
JrBtNPnekUU,3160240,3167280,if we don't have any air  we can't  right breathe without spacesuits
JrBtNPnekUU,3167280,3174079,astronaut can only survive for about 15  seconds that's not a lot of time
JrBtNPnekUU,3174079,3180559,oh no i better go put on my spacesuits  be right back whoa  that close
JrBtNPnekUU,3180559,3187040,that's why we really need spacesuits  when we go out of earth atmosphere
JrBtNPnekUU,3187040,3193359,so let's check out all the parts to a  suit that we need if we were to go out
JrBtNPnekUU,3193359,3198720,to outer space  did you know that the whole space suits
JrBtNPnekUU,3198720,3206000,weigh around  280 pounds  that's more than adult kangaroo and
JrBtNPnekUU,3206000,3211280,that's without anybody inside  here are all the things to keep us safe
JrBtNPnekUU,3211280,3218480,while we go on an adventure into outer  space  our whole space suit let us breathe
JrBtNPnekUU,3218480,3224000,inside the suit  okay let's put it on so excited always
JrBtNPnekUU,3224000,3229440,wanted to be an astronaut  now just kind of
JrBtNPnekUU,3229440,3234559,put on the sleeve one side  and the other side yay
JrBtNPnekUU,3234559,3241520,zip it up   on my belt  what'd you guys think
JrBtNPnekUU,3241920,3248640,next we have our space boots so we can  walk around  all right let's put it
JrBtNPnekUU,3248839,3253920,on what do you guys think of my space  boots do you think i can do the moonwalk
JrBtNPnekUU,3253920,3259599,it's just the moonwalk  no okay  next we got our handy dandy gloves to
JrBtNPnekUU,3259599,3263160,protect our hands
JrBtNPnekUU,3267670,3274720,[Music]  then our helmet protects our head and  doesn't let air escape
JrBtNPnekUU,3274720,3282400,all right you guys ready  woohoo what you guys think of my  spacesuit now we are ready to go on our
JrBtNPnekUU,3282400,3288240,adventure to outer space let's go  whoa
JrBtNPnekUU,3289040,3295359,i'm so excited to go to outer space oh  are you guys ready to blast off all
JrBtNPnekUU,3295359,3300480,right  five  four  three
JrBtNPnekUU,3300480,3303480,two
JrBtNPnekUU,3309920,3316160,wow look at all these things up in space  i see the moon
JrBtNPnekUU,3316160,3323920,whoa  and i see  mars i wonder if anybody's there in mars
JrBtNPnekUU,3323920,3331440,the international space station  hi  oh no what's that oh it's a media we
JrBtNPnekUU,3331440,3337920,better get out of here  so since we learned so much about
JrBtNPnekUU,3337920,3343599,astronauts let's do a pop quiz  number one
JrBtNPnekUU,3343599,3348960,what was the first earthlings to orbit  space
JrBtNPnekUU,3348960,3355599,was it a  a cat  was it b  a bunny
JrBtNPnekUU,3355599,3364160,or was it c  a dog oh  that's right it was c a dog
JrBtNPnekUU,3364160,3370799,question number two  why do astronaut need space suit
JrBtNPnekUU,3370799,3378000,is it because a the atmosphere in space  is different than earth
JrBtNPnekUU,3378000,3383820,or is it because b  they need space suits to go to sleep
JrBtNPnekUU,3383820,3389280,[Music]  or is it because c
JrBtNPnekUU,3389280,3396559,they look cool what do you think they do  look pretty cool  the answer is because a that's right
JrBtNPnekUU,3396559,3403680,because the atmosphere in space  is different than on earth
JrBtNPnekUU,3403680,3410319,question number three  how much  does a space suit weigh
JrBtNPnekUU,3410319,3419040,does it weigh a  100 pounds b  280 pounds or is it c
JrBtNPnekUU,3419040,3424319,500  pounds oh that's pretty heavy the answer
JrBtNPnekUU,3424319,3429760,is b  280  pounds
JrBtNPnekUU,3429760,3435280,yay good job i'm answering all those  questions right on the quiz we didn't
JrBtNPnekUU,3435280,3440319,get them all right it's okay we can try  again next time
JrBtNPnekUU,3440319,3446160,now that we know why we need our space  suits let's go back into our spaceship
JrBtNPnekUU,3446160,3454720,and tell ryan where i gotta put on my  space helmet  all right let's blast off and go home
JrBtNPnekUU,3458240,3464880,whoa  whoa  ryan so that is why you need a spacesuit
JrBtNPnekUU,3464880,3473078,in space okay okay  i'm ready up okay ryan have fun in space
JrBtNPnekUU,3475359,3480000,bye earth i'm gonna go to space now
JrBtNPnekUU,3482799,3491440,so everybody on ion  ah  you yawn your mommy yawn your daddy on
JrBtNPnekUU,3491440,3499680,some animals yawn too  panda yawn a cute little puppy yawn cat
JrBtNPnekUU,3499680,3507920,yawned and a lion yawn too  [Music]  but why do we yawn do we yawn because
JrBtNPnekUU,3507920,3513040,we're  sleepy  [Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,3513040,3517839,do we yawn because we're bored
JrBtNPnekUU,3518720,3524180,do we yawn because we saw somebody else  yawn
JrBtNPnekUU,3524180,3530240,[Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,3530240,3537920,all this yawning is making me  yawn too  but the question is why do we yawn we
JrBtNPnekUU,3537920,3543200,yawn because your brain  needs to cool off this is your brain and
JrBtNPnekUU,3543200,3550720,have been working hard all day and so it  needs to cool off with more air
JrBtNPnekUU,3550720,3556000,when you yawn  you breathe in more air and it goes in
JrBtNPnekUU,3556000,3566640,your body  into your head and cools off your brain  think of your brain like a big computer
JrBtNPnekUU,3567040,3572559,when you use your computer it warms up  and up and up and it gets super hot
JrBtNPnekUU,3572559,3577760,because you're making it work a lot and  when your brain works super hard it
JrBtNPnekUU,3577760,3586079,starts warming up and then you  yawn  so it needs to cool off so all day
JrBtNPnekUU,3586079,3592960,everything we do requires your brain to  work  it could be playing video games
JrBtNPnekUU,3592960,3600200,it could be working out  it could be science experiments
JrBtNPnekUU,3600319,3605920,so make sure you get some rest did you  know that yawning
JrBtNPnekUU,3605920,3612319,is also contagious so if i yawn  [Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,3612319,3617520,you do too  did you yawn  humans and animals can use yawning as a
JrBtNPnekUU,3617520,3624000,way to communicate with each other  without worse  so if i wave to you
JrBtNPnekUU,3624000,3629920,you wave to me and we just both say hi  without choosing words
JrBtNPnekUU,3629920,3635599,so if i yawn  my dog will yawn too
JrBtNPnekUU,3635599,3641280,and they will also yawn because they can  understand me and how i feel
JrBtNPnekUU,3641280,3649599,now that we know why we yawn let's take  a quiz  so why do we yawn because we're hungry
JrBtNPnekUU,3649599,3657839,because we because we smell bad  or because we need to cool off our brain
JrBtNPnekUU,3657839,3665680,fun fact did you know that guinea pig  yawn ha  to display anger
JrBtNPnekUU,3665680,3671359,oh it's okay there there there there  you're gonna be fine all right to recap
JrBtNPnekUU,3671359,3677119,so why do we ha yawn again is it because  we're itchy
JrBtNPnekUU,3677280,3682720,is it because we're ticklish  no the reason why we yawn is because we
JrBtNPnekUU,3682720,3688400,need to cool off our brains great job  now that we all know why we yawn let's
JrBtNPnekUU,3688400,3696720,go tell ryan  so guys that is why we yawn guys guys
JrBtNPnekUU,3696720,3704400,i guess they're asleep so  nap time  a volcano is a hill
JrBtNPnekUU,3704400,3710960,or a mountain on earth crust that's  connected to the magma chamber
JrBtNPnekUU,3710960,3716559,underground  the best part about a volcano is the
JrBtNPnekUU,3716559,3722559,lava  and the magma  did you know
JrBtNPnekUU,3722559,3727760,lava and magma are two different  things
JrBtNPnekUU,3727760,3732240,the magma is underground
JrBtNPnekUU,3733119,3740319,and lava is when it's on the surface  so only after the magma breaks the
JrBtNPnekUU,3740319,3746798,earth's surface it's when it's called  the lava oh look it's coming
JrBtNPnekUU,3747039,3752760,oh no the floor is lava we gotta run
JrBtNPnekUU,3754079,3759520,oh wow  look at the eruption
JrBtNPnekUU,3760079,3766799,wow there's so much ash in the air we  gotta go okay come on let's go
JrBtNPnekUU,3767119,3772480,volcanoes erupt because pressure is  being forced out of the earth's surface
JrBtNPnekUU,3772480,3778160,sometimes there's too much pressure and  it just explodes
JrBtNPnekUU,3778160,3784960,wow so just like if you take the soda  can and you shake it and pressure start
JrBtNPnekUU,3784960,3791839,building up and up and up it will  explode when you open it just like a
JrBtNPnekUU,3791839,3796960,volcano does when the earth breaks open
JrBtNPnekUU,3796960,3803359,whoa crushed did somebody say crushed  yes like a pizza crust yes the
JrBtNPnekUU,3803359,3808720,earthquake you're right guys it's kind  of shaped like a pizza crust too hmm can
JrBtNPnekUU,3808720,3815440,i have some sure of course  there's plenty of pizza to show
JrBtNPnekUU,3818240,3824480,you have to learn how to share oops i'm  sorry  so if you cut up in the earth and take
JrBtNPnekUU,3824480,3830079,out a piece that looks like a pizza  slice  the earth cross will be in the same
JrBtNPnekUU,3830079,3838038,place as where the pizza crust would be  wow this looks super yummy and delicious
JrBtNPnekUU,3840079,3846720,some volcanoes explode so  big that it makes a huge hole that you
JrBtNPnekUU,3846720,3855119,can see all the way from outer space  wow look i see the volcano right now
JrBtNPnekUU,3855119,3861359,some volcano even have produced a whole  island like hawaii
JrBtNPnekUU,3861359,3866559,i have an idea  let's go to hawaii
JrBtNPnekUU,3866559,3872559,we're in hawaii and guess what  got my sunglasses
JrBtNPnekUU,3872559,3878640,got my beach ball  [Music]  and got my pool noodles
JrBtNPnekUU,3878640,3882720,let's get swimming in hawaii
JrBtNPnekUU,3884400,3890000,now let's go on an adventure  inside a volcano let's go
JrBtNPnekUU,3890000,3896799,whoa  whoa  we're here
JrBtNPnekUU,3896799,3902799,so now we are underneath the earth crust  and  do you guys hear it
JrBtNPnekUU,3902799,3909319,i hear lots and lots of rumbling  wow
JrBtNPnekUU,3909680,3916240,let's get out of here whoa  whoa whoa it was a close one whoa
JrBtNPnekUU,3916240,3923200,oh no it's getting full of ash and gas  in here wow we're getting close i can
JrBtNPnekUU,3923200,3927599,see the magma let's keep going
JrBtNPnekUU,3928960,3937280,wow  this is fun  whoa it's like a sea of magma whoa wait
JrBtNPnekUU,3937280,3943200,what was that  we should get out of here while we can  let's go  whoa
JrBtNPnekUU,3943200,3950480,oh no guys the volcano is about to blow  the floor is magma we got a hurry let's
JrBtNPnekUU,3950480,3959119,go let's get out of here  that was so much fun let's do a pop quiz
JrBtNPnekUU,3959119,3964160,question number one where does lava flow
JrBtNPnekUU,3964160,3969280,on the earth's surface  the north pole
JrBtNPnekUU,3969280,3976880,or  in the glacier  the answer is the earth's surface
JrBtNPnekUU,3976880,3984720,question number two  where does magma flow  on antarctica
JrBtNPnekUU,3984720,3991359,underground  or is it in a tornado  magma flows
JrBtNPnekUU,3991359,3999280,underground  and last question  why does volcano erupt
JrBtNPnekUU,3999280,4004319,is it because they're full of yummy  pizza
JrBtNPnekUU,4004960,4010319,or is it because pressure is being  forced out of the earth's crust
JrBtNPnekUU,4010319,4017280,or is it because that's how soda is made  the answer is it's because the pressure
JrBtNPnekUU,4017280,4024640,is being forced out of the earth crust  if you got it right good job
JrBtNPnekUU,4024640,4030800,and if you did it it's okay because  we're learning right now you can answer  and try again
JrBtNPnekUU,4030800,4035839,[Music]  mommy's coming back let's prank her
JrBtNPnekUU,4038720,4046599,and ryan that's why volcano erupts wait  where's ryan and where's daddy
JrBtNPnekUU,4048799,4053280,thank you for watching our volcano video  bye
JrBtNPnekUU,4056000,4060799,hi again so why does lightning happen
JrBtNPnekUU,4061599,4067280,did you know lightning happened it's  because of electrostatic discharge
JrBtNPnekUU,4067280,4074079,between the cloud up there  and the ground down below
JrBtNPnekUU,4074160,4080720,so static electricity is like when you  rub your socks  across the carpet
JrBtNPnekUU,4080720,4088160,and then  you shock someone  lightning is just like that except
JrBtNPnekUU,4088160,4094000,bigger and stronger  yeah
JrBtNPnekUU,4096880,4103679,see  when a storm like that happens  that static electricity
JrBtNPnekUU,4103679,4110640,in the air  static electricity creates a current
JrBtNPnekUU,4110640,4118640,and it works its way from one cloud  to another  or it touches the ground
JrBtNPnekUU,4118640,4126480,whoa see it's coming  [Music]  just like that let's get out of here
JrBtNPnekUU,4126480,4133040,a storm cloud is like a battery look at  that  plus at the top
JrBtNPnekUU,4133040,4138480,minus at the bottom  now think of a whole bunch of batteries
JrBtNPnekUU,4138480,4144560,stacks from the ground  all the way to the clouds
JrBtNPnekUU,4144560,4151120,whoa did you guys see that  once all of the batteries are connected
JrBtNPnekUU,4151120,4156000,that's lightning watch out i'm not again
JrBtNPnekUU,4156318,4163040,so when lightning happens it disturbs  the air and the sound that you hear
JrBtNPnekUU,4163040,4168318,you guys hear that  that's thunder  do you guys hear that
JrBtNPnekUU,4168318,4171838,do you see that what is that
JrBtNPnekUU,4173440,4180719,who are you i am thor son of odin god of  thunder  that's right thor god of thunder you're
JrBtNPnekUU,4180719,4186480,the perfect person to help us learn  all about lightning can i ask you a few
JrBtNPnekUU,4186480,4194000,questions of course i know all about  thunder  you know that big ball of flash
JrBtNPnekUU,4194000,4201360,how is it created  well that big flash you see  is when the negative energy in the sky
JrBtNPnekUU,4201360,4208159,connects to the positive energy in the  ground creating a channel for the  electricity connection wow
JrBtNPnekUU,4208159,4214320,and how strong is it how strong is it it  can contain up to one billion volts of
JrBtNPnekUU,4214320,4220080,electricity a billion  volts  that is super strong
JrBtNPnekUU,4220080,4225679,can you handle all that power  of course i'm thor son of odin god of
JrBtNPnekUU,4225679,4231840,thunder and also lightning can you show  us sure
JrBtNPnekUU,4232080,4239840,wait thor you forgot your hammer  oh let's see  oh my get this hammer i can control
JrBtNPnekUU,4239840,4245520,lightning  it won't even move how what am i doing
JrBtNPnekUU,4245520,4253560,wrong it won't budge  oh  [Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,4253920,4260960,how are you doing that  bye  wow he's so powerful and strong
JrBtNPnekUU,4260960,4267120,now that you guys learned so much about  lightning  let's take a pop quiz
JrBtNPnekUU,4267120,4272880,question number one  so why does lightning occur
JrBtNPnekUU,4272880,4279840,a is because of  electrostatic discharge between the  cloud way up there
JrBtNPnekUU,4279840,4287600,to the ground way down below  or is it because of b captain america is
JrBtNPnekUU,4287600,4294080,angry i'm angry  a lightning strike
JrBtNPnekUU,4294239,4299520,or is it c  a volcano  oh no
JrBtNPnekUU,4299520,4304400,it's erupting oh no guys i'm okay now
JrBtNPnekUU,4304640,4310000,do you guys know the answer  it's a it's because of the electrostatic
JrBtNPnekUU,4310000,4316960,discharge between the cloud  and the ground  question number two
JrBtNPnekUU,4316960,4322880,what  sound  is made  from lightning
JrBtNPnekUU,4322880,4328320,is it a  a mouse squeaking
JrBtNPnekUU,4328320,4333760,or is it b  a lion roar
JrBtNPnekUU,4333840,4340480,or is it c  thunder  well what'd you guys guess
JrBtNPnekUU,4340480,4346320,the answer is  c  thunder did you hear that
JrBtNPnekUU,4346320,4352719,do you guys hear the thunder  oh it's super loud  question number three
JrBtNPnekUU,4352719,4358400,lightning can carry up to how many volts  of electricity is it a
JrBtNPnekUU,4358400,4364239,5 volts  or is it b  10 volts
JrBtNPnekUU,4364239,4370480,or is it c  a billion volts  did you guys guess the answer
JrBtNPnekUU,4370480,4378159,it is c  a billion volts  that's such a huge number
JrBtNPnekUU,4378159,4384239,good job learning all about lightnings  today and if you didn't get them all  right it's okay you can try again next
JrBtNPnekUU,4384239,4391360,time  now let's go back and tell ryan all that  we learned okay
JrBtNPnekUU,4393199,4400000,okay guys let's tell right all about  lightning  but where's ryan ryan
JrBtNPnekUU,4400000,4405600,ryan  ryan you in there  yeah mommy i was hiding from the
JrBtNPnekUU,4405600,4412079,lightning  is it still there it's gone ryan let's  come out and play
JrBtNPnekUU,4414880,4423000,thanks for watching and remember always  stay happy and rise up
JrBtNPnekUU,4433520,4441520,what happened ryan the pool overflowed  and now there's a giant wing oh no like  a tsunami i think so but
JrBtNPnekUU,4441520,4446880,mommy how do tsunamis happen  good question ryan come on explain it to
JrBtNPnekUU,4446880,4452080,you let's go guys  [Applause]  [Music]
JrBtNPnekUU,4452080,4457640,hi  did you know that tsunamis can move as  fast as
JrBtNPnekUU,4457640,4464559,500 miles per hour  i see one right there run
JrBtNPnekUU,4467360,4474560,that's as fast as a jet plane  is that a jet plane duct for cover
JrBtNPnekUU,4476480,4481520,so a tsunami is a sudden large c wave
JrBtNPnekUU,4481520,4487199,a series of waves  due to water displacement  but
JrBtNPnekUU,4487199,4493600,why does tsunami happen  because there's a movement of energy
JrBtNPnekUU,4493600,4500480,throughout the water  okay so tsunamis usually happens because
JrBtNPnekUU,4500480,4506960,of four different causes  number one  earthquake
JrBtNPnekUU,4506960,4513280,if an earthquake is big enough  or if it happens under water
JrBtNPnekUU,4513280,4519120,it can travel through the water and its  energy can cause a
JrBtNPnekUU,4519120,4526960,tsunami  is that another one  thanks a lot earthquake
JrBtNPnekUU,4526960,4533040,the second cause of tsunami is  underwater volcanic eruption when a
JrBtNPnekUU,4533040,4538159,volcano erupts under water like so huh
JrBtNPnekUU,4538159,4544640,the water must go somewhere and all the  energy that comes out of the volcano
JrBtNPnekUU,4544640,4551120,forces its way through the water  making a tsunami oh look i see a
JrBtNPnekUU,4551120,4558480,volcanic eruption underwater right now  oh no we better run away from that too
JrBtNPnekUU,4558480,4565199,the third way a tsunami can happen  is a submarine landslide
JrBtNPnekUU,4565199,4571920,sometimes if there's a giant amount of  ice or debris or rock that's slide
JrBtNPnekUU,4571920,4577760,through the water it will cause a  tsunami on the other side
JrBtNPnekUU,4577760,4584159,the fourth reason that could cause a  tsunami is falling meteor yep that's
JrBtNPnekUU,4584159,4591920,right even giant falling meteors from  space  can crash into the water and create a
JrBtNPnekUU,4591920,4594920,tsunami
JrBtNPnekUU,4596960,4604480,[Music]  let's take a look at how this happens so  this science experiment will show us the
JrBtNPnekUU,4604480,4612719,difference between regular wave and  tsunami  here we have the land
JrBtNPnekUU,4613440,4619840,and here we have the ocean  so if we turn on the fan like so
JrBtNPnekUU,4619840,4626159,what wave  will go this way towards lands because  of the winds and tides
JrBtNPnekUU,4626159,4632159,wow  look look at gus and pogo
JrBtNPnekUU,4632640,4638560,but a tsunami is different because water  is displaced and energy will move
JrBtNPnekUU,4638560,4645120,through the water  we'll create the tsunami using this  board so you can see the difference
JrBtNPnekUU,4645120,4650960,let's say a powerful earthquake hits  and underneath the water the plates will
JrBtNPnekUU,4650960,4656640,move wow do you feel it  this board will demonstrate what will
JrBtNPnekUU,4656640,4662560,happen when the earthquake creates a  tsunami look you will see the water rise
JrBtNPnekUU,4662560,4668960,up because the water is being displaced  wow  then you will see the energy moves
JrBtNPnekUU,4668960,4674960,sideways  oh no guys be careful  pack alpha
JrBtNPnekUU,4674960,4681520,ghost move be careful then you will see  the tsunami form growing taller and
JrBtNPnekUU,4681520,4687760,taller and it will smash against the  land  watch out red tightening combo
JrBtNPnekUU,4687760,4694560,and look the tsunami is carrying all  this stuff back into the ocean  look there are towels in the ocean
JrBtNPnekUU,4694560,4701040,they're  beach balls in the ocean and they're  floaty  carrying back and all the rocks too it's
JrBtNPnekUU,4701040,4706880,going back into the ocean  wow that's such a powerful tsunami but
JrBtNPnekUU,4706880,4713199,it's okay they're okay right  could you imagine if this tsunami is in
JrBtNPnekUU,4713199,4718320,real life it would have been super  powerful and strong
JrBtNPnekUU,4718320,4724320,well now that we learned so much about  tsunami  let's take a pop quiz
JrBtNPnekUU,4724320,4729440,number one  how fast  can a tsunami move
JrBtNPnekUU,4729440,4735280,is it a  500 miles per hour  or is it b
JrBtNPnekUU,4735280,4744159,100 miles per hour  or is it c  only one mile per hour
JrBtNPnekUU,4744159,4752320,did you guess it  it is a  500 miles per hour as fast as a jet
JrBtNPnekUU,4752320,4759120,plane  question number two  why does a tsunami happen
JrBtNPnekUU,4759120,4764880,is it because of a  because there's a movement of energy  through the water
JrBtNPnekUU,4764880,4771920,or it's because b  it makes a dinosaur extinct  sorry dinosaur
JrBtNPnekUU,4771920,4777280,or is it because c because there's a  giant shark in the water look there's
JrBtNPnekUU,4777280,4785120,one right now  oh it's a friendly shark hi mr shark
JrBtNPnekUU,4785120,4790560,did you guess it  why does tsunami happen it's because a
JrBtNPnekUU,4790560,4796239,there's a movement of energy through the  water
JrBtNPnekUU,4796239,4801760,question number three  what can cause a tsunami
JrBtNPnekUU,4801760,4807280,is because of a  angry angry whale
JrBtNPnekUU,4807760,4814159,or is it because of b  earthquake underground volcano
JrBtNPnekUU,4814159,4821040,landslide  and  meteors  did you guess it the answer is b what
JrBtNPnekUU,4821040,4828480,caused a tsunami earthquake underground  volcanoes landslides and meteor
JrBtNPnekUU,4828480,4834000,yeah you guys did so great and if you  didn't get all the answer right it's  okay you can try again
JrBtNPnekUU,4834000,4839550,now let's go back and tell ryan  everything that we know about tsunami
JrBtNPnekUU,4839550,4844639,[Music]  hey ryan i'm back hi mommy did you learn
JrBtNPnekUU,4844639,4852080,a whole bunch about tsunami yeah  thank you mommy bye remember
JrBtNPnekUU,4852159,4860020,bye  please click on one of these videos for  ryan toy review more fun
