NmONjHcN6xM,22560,25039,of education spotlight today we're
NmONjHcN6xM,25039,27039,looking at the school's welfare unit of
NmONjHcN6xM,27039,29199,the ministry of education and the role
NmONjHcN6xM,29199,31279,it plays in our education system while

NmONjHcN6xM,40000,42320,jillian vivehouse tells us more about it
NmONjHcN6xM,42320,44640,the schools feel welfare unit basically
NmONjHcN6xM,44640,48399,looks into attendance and punctuality
NmONjHcN6xM,48399,50559,that is our main role at the school's
NmONjHcN6xM,50559,51920,welfare unit
NmONjHcN6xM,51920,55360,we also work with the schools
NmONjHcN6xM,55360,56840,children and their
NmONjHcN6xM,56840,59760,families to raise the bar of eye
NmONjHcN6xM,59760,61840,achievement and
NmONjHcN6xM,61840,64320,in doing so we try to
NmONjHcN6xM,64320,65640,prevent
NmONjHcN6xM,65640,69119,absenteeism truancy and disengagement
NmONjHcN6xM,69119,71200,from schools activity
NmONjHcN6xM,71200,73200,the welfare unit can be regarded as a
NmONjHcN6xM,73200,76159,change agent in the education system we
NmONjHcN6xM,76159,78880,find that children are coming to school
NmONjHcN6xM,78880,82479,with issues also not only the issue of
NmONjHcN6xM,82479,84240,absenteeism
NmONjHcN6xM,84240,87759,and truancy disengagement bottom they
NmONjHcN6xM,87759,90400,are coming to school with other personal
NmONjHcN6xM,90400,91920,issues and
NmONjHcN6xM,91920,95360,family issues as well so we work as a
NmONjHcN6xM,95360,97600,change change agent
NmONjHcN6xM,97600,99439,to help those children and their
NmONjHcN6xM,99439,101840,families so they can restore their
NmONjHcN6xM,101840,104960,capacities to function in school and the
NmONjHcN6xM,104960,107600,society as a whole the unit comprises of
NmONjHcN6xM,107600,109439,school welfare officers as well as
NmONjHcN6xM,109439,110720,guidance counselors who work
NmONjHcN6xM,110720,112720,holistically to have interventions with
NmONjHcN6xM,112720,115360,parents and students recently we would
NmONjHcN6xM,115360,116880,have
NmONjHcN6xM,116880,119840,a drug campaign in region 3 because we
NmONjHcN6xM,119840,121439,recognize that
NmONjHcN6xM,121439,123920,drugs are as prevalent now in our school
NmONjHcN6xM,123920,124880,so
NmONjHcN6xM,124880,127520,we are having now like campaigns to try
NmONjHcN6xM,127520,130239,to sample the use of drugs and alcohol
NmONjHcN6xM,130239,132560,with the use of technology now we're
NmONjHcN6xM,132560,135520,having so many issues that
NmONjHcN6xM,135520,137440,we didn't had like
NmONjHcN6xM,137440,140160,years ago and recently these
NmONjHcN6xM,140160,143360,issues are surfacing but what we do we
NmONjHcN6xM,143360,146480,try to empower our students and teachers
NmONjHcN6xM,146480,149200,as well because a lot of times when
NmONjHcN6xM,149200,151519,there's an incident the first thing
NmONjHcN6xM,151519,153599,people do is to take out
NmONjHcN6xM,153599,156000,their um cell phone it might even be an
NmONjHcN6xM,156000,158480,incident to render assistance to a
NmONjHcN6xM,158480,162239,person but persons are just videoing so
NmONjHcN6xM,162239,164640,we are trying to um
NmONjHcN6xM,164640,166000,stamp out
NmONjHcN6xM,166000,168640,the smartphone use during instructional
NmONjHcN6xM,168640,170879,period in fact there is a cell phone
NmONjHcN6xM,170879,172080,policy
NmONjHcN6xM,172080,174239,that we have to revisit
NmONjHcN6xM,174239,176160,you know auto
NmONjHcN6xM,176160,178879,of some of these issues
NmONjHcN6xM,178879,181120,on a minimum level some of the work of
NmONjHcN6xM,181120,183519,welfare officers they usually do is
NmONjHcN6xM,183519,186720,visit schools because as i said earlier
NmONjHcN6xM,186720,188800,our main roles
NmONjHcN6xM,188800,191040,is to look into absenteeism and
NmONjHcN6xM,191040,194560,punctuality they do school visit to
NmONjHcN6xM,194560,196879,ascertain the level of attendance of
NmONjHcN6xM,196879,200720,students based on their findings they
NmONjHcN6xM,200720,203120,probably visit the homes
NmONjHcN6xM,203120,205920,they visit hospitals because if
NmONjHcN6xM,205920,208159,from the visit they learn that children
NmONjHcN6xM,208159,209040,are
NmONjHcN6xM,209040,210640,absent due to
NmONjHcN6xM,210640,212959,hospitalization they would visit
NmONjHcN6xM,212959,214480,hospitals
NmONjHcN6xM,214480,217120,so to know exactly what is going on they
NmONjHcN6xM,217120,220799,will engage in a parental employment
NmONjHcN6xM,220799,223360,and poor parent and we find that due to
NmONjHcN6xM,223360,225680,those activities we have in a lot of
NmONjHcN6xM,225680,228879,parental involvement not in our schools
NmONjHcN6xM,228879,230239,recently
NmONjHcN6xM,230239,234959,region 5 and region 7 would have had
NmONjHcN6xM,234959,237200,activities with their parents especially
NmONjHcN6xM,237200,238560,their mothers
NmONjHcN6xM,238560,240959,they had activities with their mothers
NmONjHcN6xM,240959,243840,to empower mothers region 5 are an
NmONjHcN6xM,243840,247200,activity whereby they try to recognize
NmONjHcN6xM,247200,249840,mothers that are actively involved in
NmONjHcN6xM,249840,253360,their children's welfare at the school's
NmONjHcN6xM,253360,257120,region 7 recently had a parent workshop
NmONjHcN6xM,257120,259759,for mothers and it's in collaboration
NmONjHcN6xM,259759,261680,with um
NmONjHcN6xM,261680,264479,other welfare department because region
NmONjHcN6xM,264479,265680,7
NmONjHcN6xM,265680,268800,use a welfare officer from region
NmONjHcN6xM,268800,270960,5 so they usually collaborate to have
NmONjHcN6xM,270960,273600,activities done ms5 has assured that the
NmONjHcN6xM,273600,275600,unit is utilizing their resources to
NmONjHcN6xM,275600,278080,ensure the needs of students are met the
NmONjHcN6xM,278080,280639,welfare unit as it is now
NmONjHcN6xM,280639,282960,we're working with limited human
NmONjHcN6xM,282960,284320,resources
NmONjHcN6xM,284320,286800,so at no time you would find one welfare
NmONjHcN6xM,286800,289040,office or guidance counselor at a
NmONjHcN6xM,289040,290720,particular school
NmONjHcN6xM,290720,292560,on a daily basis
NmONjHcN6xM,292560,295759,what we do we have our officers in
NmONjHcN6xM,295759,297759,clusters
NmONjHcN6xM,297759,300320,the schools are divided
NmONjHcN6xM,300320,302800,based on the number of officers
NmONjHcN6xM,302800,305360,officers are responsible for particular
NmONjHcN6xM,305360,308960,schools so they will visit those schools
NmONjHcN6xM,308960,310960,plans are in the pipelines to broaden
NmONjHcN6xM,310960,313440,the scope of the unit i would hope that
NmONjHcN6xM,313440,315360,each school each secondary school
NmONjHcN6xM,315360,316800,especially would have a guidance
NmONjHcN6xM,316800,319520,counselors guidance counselor sorry so
NmONjHcN6xM,319520,321360,that they will be able to empower
NmONjHcN6xM,321360,325039,students and in fact before we do um
NmONjHcN6xM,325039,326960,they would be more proactive
NmONjHcN6xM,326960,329360,because a lot of times we find that we
NmONjHcN6xM,329360,331520,are willing to be proactive but because
NmONjHcN6xM,331520,334560,of the limited human resources we have
NmONjHcN6xM,334560,336240,to be um
NmONjHcN6xM,336240,339840,proactive so i'm hoping that um
NmONjHcN6xM,339840,342160,they will be able to work with our
NmONjHcN6xM,342160,343919,students
NmONjHcN6xM,343919,345520,guide them
NmONjHcN6xM,345520,347280,where necessary
NmONjHcN6xM,347280,349680,so that we can maintain order and
NmONjHcN6xM,349680,352720,discipline in our schools because um
NmONjHcN6xM,352720,354800,we don't want to be reactive
NmONjHcN6xM,354800,356560,if they're there on a daily basis they
NmONjHcN6xM,356560,357919,will able to be
NmONjHcN6xM,357919,361440,more proactive i can assure you because
NmONjHcN6xM,361440,363759,in our unit we
NmONjHcN6xM,363759,367199,look straightly strictly into
NmONjHcN6xM,367199,369600,confidentiality
NmONjHcN6xM,369600,371440,whatever we do
NmONjHcN6xM,371440,374160,it's confident it's supposed to be
NmONjHcN6xM,374160,378800,confident among the student and the um
NmONjHcN6xM,378800,380800,the guidance counselor
NmONjHcN6xM,380800,385199,but on our um in any intervention with
NmONjHcN6xM,385199,387440,the guidance counselor the first thing
NmONjHcN6xM,387440,389680,the guidance counselor would do is to
NmONjHcN6xM,389680,391520,assure the child
NmONjHcN6xM,391520,393199,that
NmONjHcN6xM,393199,396000,the person can be trusted the counsel
NmONjHcN6xM,396000,398400,can be trusted by establishing a
NmONjHcN6xM,398400,400960,relationship that's the fourth step to
NmONjHcN6xM,400960,404000,establish a relationship to get a child
NmONjHcN6xM,404000,407680,to be comfortable and to gain trust in
NmONjHcN6xM,407680,410240,you this has been education spotlight
