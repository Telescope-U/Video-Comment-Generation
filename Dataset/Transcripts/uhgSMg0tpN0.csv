uhgSMg0tpN0,28000,35680,reporting and here's what we're tracking  tonight  the largest logistics company in the  local oil and gas sector ramps logistics
uhgSMg0tpN0,35680,42719,has been denied a local content license  to operate in guyana by the local  content secretariat the secretariat
uhgSMg0tpN0,42719,50160,falls under the ministry of natural  resources  news source understands that the company  received information about being denied
uhgSMg0tpN0,50160,56960,the license just over a week ago and has  been making efforts to understand the  reason behind the decision
uhgSMg0tpN0,56960,63039,in a statement today the company said  the recently passed local content act  stipulates that a company must have a
uhgSMg0tpN0,63039,68240,local content certificate to operate in  the ghana energy sector rams logistics
uhgSMg0tpN0,68240,74799,gana incorporated has followed all the  required guidelines to apply for the  certificate and was denied the company
uhgSMg0tpN0,74799,82080,said  sources at a company have told news  source that no clear reason has been  given for the denial and the decision by
uhgSMg0tpN0,82080,88640,the local content secretariat threatens  several major multi-million dollar  contracts that the company already has
uhgSMg0tpN0,88640,93840,with exxon mobil and other oil companies  operating in guyana contacted today for
uhgSMg0tpN0,93840,100560,a comment at the head of the local  content secretariat martin pertab direct  law questions and queries to the office
uhgSMg0tpN0,100560,107119,of the minister of natural resources  news source was able to reach out to the  minister of natural resources vikram
uhgSMg0tpN0,107119,113759,barrett the minister said while he is  unaware of the decision to deny the  license to the rams logistics company
uhgSMg0tpN0,113759,120719,there are several reasons that could  trigger such a move i know i know they  are playing um i got to get some
uhgSMg0tpN0,120719,126479,information on the secretariat but they  don't reach the criteria any company as  a matter of fact not ramps alone
uhgSMg0tpN0,126479,132720,but any company if they don't read the  criteria  as stated in the legislation then we can
uhgSMg0tpN0,132720,139360,approve  um it's not only 51  ownership guy needs ownership
uhgSMg0tpN0,139360,146160,but also 75 percent uh managerial stuff  90 total stuff
uhgSMg0tpN0,146160,151760,so there are other criteria just  other than just 51 ownership
uhgSMg0tpN0,151760,157200,and then we got to be able to verify  the 51 percent ownership too it's not
uhgSMg0tpN0,157200,163440,just  providing a document that an individual  has 51 percent ownership was a guy he  said listen
uhgSMg0tpN0,163440,169200,um obviously they got to be  they got to be evidence to show that the  person is actually investing in the
uhgSMg0tpN0,169200,175920,business and is not economic rent guyana  passed local content legislation earlier  this year requiring companies operating
uhgSMg0tpN0,175920,182080,in the oil and gas sector to meet a  number of criteria to be deemed eligible  for a local content certificate the
uhgSMg0tpN0,182080,188720,legislation seeks to give guyanese own  companies operating in the oil and gas  sector an advantage in doing business
uhgSMg0tpN0,188720,194640,there were some concerns expressed by  foreign stakeholders about the  legislation and since its passage a
uhgSMg0tpN0,194640,200959,number of foreign companies operating in  guyana have been forced to merge their  operations with local companies and get
uhgSMg0tpN0,200959,207120,more locals involved in their business  minister barrett explained to news  source that in the event of a company
uhgSMg0tpN0,207120,212560,being denied a local content certificate  the legislation provides room for appeal
uhgSMg0tpN0,212560,219040,the secretariat has been very careful in  review and application  however there is a clause in the
uhgSMg0tpN0,219040,224480,in the legislation to say if you're  denied by the um  the secretariat then you appeal to the
uhgSMg0tpN0,224480,231200,minister for review  so  if that is true then they have to follow  these two course the rams logistics
uhgSMg0tpN0,231200,237200,company has called a media conference  for thursday to address the denial of  the license the company currently
uhgSMg0tpN0,237200,243680,employs over 500 persons through its  partnerships and has been working  closely with other companies involved in

uhgSMg0tpN0,472000,478319,over the bribery allegations made  against the vice president to the office  of the president in a protest which
uhgSMg0tpN0,478319,485280,called on the vice president to the  midst office  the small group of protesters braved the  reign with their placards as they called
uhgSMg0tpN0,485280,490840,for a full independent probe of the  allegations  the vice president has denied the
uhgSMg0tpN0,490840,497840,allegations and president irvin ali has  dismissed the calls for any  investigation of those allegations
uhgSMg0tpN0,497840,503440,making it clear that the vice president  has his full support  opposition chief women parliament
uhgSMg0tpN0,503440,510479,christopher jones said the claims made  by chinese businessman sushi wrong in  the vice news investigation cannot be
uhgSMg0tpN0,510479,517039,dismissed he said there needs to be a  proper investigation it is a most  damning
uhgSMg0tpN0,517039,522479,revelation it is the most damning  allegations and we have to be serious as
uhgSMg0tpN0,522479,528640,a country guyana is known globally guyan  is now an oil producing country and you
uhgSMg0tpN0,528640,535920,have people from as far afield who want  to invest in this country and they will  do their search they will google guyana
uhgSMg0tpN0,535920,542720,and amongst the things that will pop up  in guyana you would see guyana for seal  and when they listen to that documentary
uhgSMg0tpN0,542720,548959,it says in that documentary that the  vice president of the cooperative  republic of guyana is involved in
uhgSMg0tpN0,548959,555680,corrupt practices in which he takes  bribe in order for people to get  business contract etc in this country
uhgSMg0tpN0,555680,562160,that in itself will serve as a deterrent  the member of parliament echoed the  views of the opposition leader that the
uhgSMg0tpN0,562160,569519,vice president should admit office to  allow an investigation of the claims  what has to happen in this case again is
uhgSMg0tpN0,569519,574640,the public pressure has to be continued  on the people's progressive party civic
uhgSMg0tpN0,574640,580080,we have to continue to involve the  international community because as we  mentioned before
uhgSMg0tpN0,580080,587279,guyana is global guyan is international  and once the international community is  involved and guyanese and citizens alike
uhgSMg0tpN0,587279,592640,come out pick up protest voice their  disgust it will bring pressure on the
uhgSMg0tpN0,592640,598640,administration that they will have to  ask barack jackman to limit office but  if you continue to remain silent that
uhgSMg0tpN0,598640,603839,will not happen another opposition  member of parliament to beat the  ceremony said there are serious
uhgSMg0tpN0,603839,610959,questions that remain following the vice  news investigation the fact that he just  passed it over to sue and says sue has
uhgSMg0tpN0,610959,617519,my full support what does that mean  what does that mean sue handles all the  agreements we want agreements who is not
uhgSMg0tpN0,617519,622800,in government what agreement is so  handled in that for who and for what and  those are the questions that have to be
uhgSMg0tpN0,622800,629360,answered and until we get those answered  that that press conference that happened  yesterday i think it was a sham mr
uhgSMg0tpN0,629360,635680,cerebel haley said while the vice  president continues to deny that he is  involved in corrupt activities concerns
uhgSMg0tpN0,635680,642000,remain especially as guinness continues  to lose ground on the international  corruption index
uhgSMg0tpN0,642000,647920,when the man said that he he was trying  to get drugged or to decide whether or  not he's going to take the bribe jaguar
uhgSMg0tpN0,647920,653920,did not leave him at that point and say  well you know what what are you talking  about i'm not in i'm not interested in
uhgSMg0tpN0,653920,659680,this this is not what i'm about this is  not what i came here for what he did he  said no sue will handle that that
uhgSMg0tpN0,659680,664959,suggests that there's something going on  that he knows that he doesn't want to  implicate himself and so he steps back
uhgSMg0tpN0,664959,671440,vice president jack leo has said his  hands are clean and there was nothing  revealed in the vice news investigation
uhgSMg0tpN0,671440,677279,that can pin the corruption claims on  him  attorney general and minister of legal
uhgSMg0tpN0,677279,682320,affairs senior council and onandlao is  defending vice president barack jagdio
uhgSMg0tpN0,682320,688800,in wake of the bribery allegations level  against the vice president in that vice  news report the vice president has
uhgSMg0tpN0,688800,695680,denied the allegations and presidential  finale has indicated that he has full  confidence in the vice president
uhgSMg0tpN0,695680,702000,now the attorney general has added his  voice in defense of mr jagdier  during his weekly issues in the news
uhgSMg0tpN0,702000,708240,television program last evening the  attorney general said the statements  made by the vice president and captured
uhgSMg0tpN0,708240,715680,by undercover cameras at his home need  to be taken in context and mr jack dear  cannot be accused of any wrongdoing
uhgSMg0tpN0,715680,721120,based on the statements  he said all government officials from  time to time would lend support to
uhgSMg0tpN0,721120,727120,members of the public and persons from  the business community who are in need  of help and that cannot be considered
uhgSMg0tpN0,727120,732240,corruption we have to go out there to  get people's support
uhgSMg0tpN0,732240,738240,when they support you  they expect  assistance
uhgSMg0tpN0,738240,744399,if you win the government  they  expect  you if you have influence in the
uhgSMg0tpN0,744399,751920,government to assist them  in expediting their particular endeavors
uhgSMg0tpN0,751920,758959,engaging in such an act  cannot be corruption and the attorney
uhgSMg0tpN0,758959,765279,general also rubbish claims that such  practices of expediting people's  business can amount to nepotism if
uhgSMg0tpN0,765279,772399,government officials trying to remove  bureaucratic red tape and i have done  that
uhgSMg0tpN0,772399,779920,i have done that directly to persons  who are the actual investors themselves
uhgSMg0tpN0,779920,787120,and i have done that for several persons  whom i know  and who may have known
uhgSMg0tpN0,787120,791760,these persons who are requesting the  help
uhgSMg0tpN0,793440,801600,and i can safely see  that many ministers in our government  and many ppp leaders
uhgSMg0tpN0,801600,806800,have had to do that  as part of their political
uhgSMg0tpN0,806800,814240,task  but amid the su allegations mr nand lal  is assuring that monies do not need to  be paid to ministers for persons to have
uhgSMg0tpN0,814240,820720,their processes expedited they have  three or four persons right now who are  from new york who are trying to make
uhgSMg0tpN0,820720,827440,contact with me because i met them in  north america quite recently
uhgSMg0tpN0,827440,833519,and they ask for their engaging in  certain  endeavors with the government
uhgSMg0tpN0,833519,840320,and they ask if their processes can be  expedited you want me to tell them no
uhgSMg0tpN0,841120,847440,you want me to tell them no when i know  that the process can be slow
uhgSMg0tpN0,847440,853839,the attorney general said it was clear  the vice news piece could not bring any  corrupt practice on the vice president
uhgSMg0tpN0,853839,859680,and therefore guyanese must see it for  what it was  while the people's national congress
uhgSMg0tpN0,859680,866639,reform which is the largest party in the  apnu afc coalition has raised questions  about the planned commission of inquiry
uhgSMg0tpN0,866639,872560,into the 2020 general elections while  there is an active elections petition  questioning the outcome of the same
uhgSMg0tpN0,872560,879040,elections before the courts  during a press conference the executive  member of the pnc reform gary best said
uhgSMg0tpN0,879040,885199,the commission of inquiry appears to be  aimed at distracting persons from the  failures of the current government and
uhgSMg0tpN0,885199,891839,allegations which were leveled against  the vice president recently mr best said  he also believes it is being convened to
uhgSMg0tpN0,891839,899120,put a stumbling block in the way of the  elections petition the pncr therefore  reiterates its call for a speedy and
uhgSMg0tpN0,899120,905839,unhindered hearing of these election  petitions  via the judicial process that is far
uhgSMg0tpN0,905839,911680,superior to that of a commission of  inquiry further  there is no need for a parallel
uhgSMg0tpN0,911680,918240,non-binding process that has no judicial  finality the people's national congress  reform is maintaining that any
uhgSMg0tpN0,918240,924399,investigation outside of the elections  petition must be contacted by the  elections commission since it was the
uhgSMg0tpN0,924399,931360,commission that conducted the elections  and must be able to review what went  wrong and where it went wrong the pncr
uhgSMg0tpN0,931360,937360,therefore views the setting up of a  commission of inquiry as a clear attempt  to hoodwink the guyanese public by
uhgSMg0tpN0,937360,943360,introducing a process which is of less  judicial value than the very election  petitions
uhgSMg0tpN0,943360,948720,it is important to note  also that the commission of inquiry is  not a court of law
uhgSMg0tpN0,948720,954959,our own commission of inquiry act allows  for hearsay evidence  it allows for accusations of misconduct
uhgSMg0tpN0,954959,960880,being made without any built-in rules of  natural natural justice  or procedural fairness to safeguard the
uhgSMg0tpN0,960880,966639,rights and interests of people who might  be so affected best said he believes the  commission of inquiry's sole purpose
uhgSMg0tpN0,966639,972240,could be to smear repetition and  characters of persons he said the  government's intention to move ahead
uhgSMg0tpN0,972240,977600,with the coi before the petitioners rule  on smacks of judicial contempt
uhgSMg0tpN0,977600,983120,although the party is not supportive of  the commission of inquiry at this time  mr best of the people's national
uhgSMg0tpN0,983120,990160,congress must be involved in the process  to produce the terms of reference for  the commission of inquiry the party's
uhgSMg0tpN0,990160,997040,position is very clear and that we  recognize the commission of inquiry as  an interference in the judicial process
uhgSMg0tpN0,997040,1003120,of the election petitions  so for us  the fact that there is a commission of  inquiry
uhgSMg0tpN0,1003120,1008959,which is under the hand of the president  and at the same time the president's  party is to be
uhgSMg0tpN0,1008959,1014720,investigated in a judicial process and  the process of the commission inquiry to
uhgSMg0tpN0,1014720,1020000,us that speaks  to the fact that only one side will be  preparing
uhgSMg0tpN0,1020000,1026558,the evidentiary processes  for the commission of inquiry  so we therefore suggest
uhgSMg0tpN0,1026558,1031918,strongly to the um to the president  and to the commissioners that in the
uhgSMg0tpN0,1031918,1037600,interest of fairness and justice  the government and opposition should  determine along with the commissioners
uhgSMg0tpN0,1037600,1044079,what are these terms of reference lest  the entire process become another sham  like the sewer fair president-elect
uhgSMg0tpN0,1044079,1050000,finale on tuesday named the four members  to serve on the elections commission of  inquiry the president said the
uhgSMg0tpN0,1050000,1056640,commission will begin its work soon  with the police complaints authorities  still investigating the police shooting

uhgSMg0tpN0,1064000,1069679,probe  along with several villages some family  members staged a protest this midday
uhgSMg0tpN0,1069679,1076880,outside the headquarters of the special  branch unit of the guyana police force  an officer from the special branch unit
uhgSMg0tpN0,1076880,1083440,has been identified as the shooter who  took the life of the youth during a  reported on the cover operation
uhgSMg0tpN0,1083440,1090000,bacchus was shot six times five of those  shots were to his back while the  remaining one was to the chest at close
uhgSMg0tpN0,1090000,1095440,range based on the post-mortem  examination  the youth is expected to be laid to rest
uhgSMg0tpN0,1095440,1101520,this coming weekend  during the protest dated dead man's  mother juanette sandy said her son was
uhgSMg0tpN0,1101520,1107600,murdered in cold blood and the ghana  police force needs to take criminal  action against its rank that she
uhgSMg0tpN0,1107600,1112679,believes went ruger that's premeditated  murder and we need justice for
uhgSMg0tpN0,1112679,1119200,quindanbachos the grieving mother said  she will continue to stand up for  justice for her son and she's not
uhgSMg0tpN0,1119200,1126080,satisfied with the investigations so far  no we are not satisfied
uhgSMg0tpN0,1127120,1133440,because we really really need justice  because they are not coming out to say  anything to us  neither the family because the family is
uhgSMg0tpN0,1133440,1139280,more important that's the baby mother  and the baby here last week the acting  police commissioner clifton hicken
uhgSMg0tpN0,1139280,1145360,traveled to the east coast of marauding  village where a young man lived and he  met with his mother and other relatives
uhgSMg0tpN0,1145360,1151840,the police commissioner promised an  impartial probe but relatives say they  are concerned that the probe appears to
uhgSMg0tpN0,1151840,1157760,be taking way too long the police have  all evidence that this shooting was if
uhgSMg0tpN0,1157760,1164240,we want to say personal but it was not  culprit was uncalled for my  my take on this topic even if a young
uhgSMg0tpN0,1164240,1169440,man got to sell you gun wherever the  cases and the information that they're  leaking out we just don't get it we
uhgSMg0tpN0,1169440,1174960,can't believe it because there are other  ways and means i think that they could  have dealt with the situation sex
uhgSMg0tpN0,1174960,1180960,bullets quinton backers is being  remembered as a hardworking young man  who was happy to be a father hours
