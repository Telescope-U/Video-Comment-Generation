8xfSL0XLRtQ,880,6720,top of the morning to you ladies my name  is jacksepticeye and welcome to a game  called the stanley parable can you
8xfSL0XLRtQ,6720,14719,believe that that was me playing the  stanley parable eight years ago who is  that child in that video i have no idea
8xfSL0XLRtQ,14719,20320,but the game came out again uh they  released an ultra deluxe stanley parable  edition
8xfSL0XLRtQ,20320,25760,and i wasn't originally going to play  this because i was like i played the  original why would i play like a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,25760,30960,remastered version of it or that's what  i thought it was but people have said  that if you've played the game before
8xfSL0XLRtQ,30960,37040,it's still worth playing again  uh and it asked me when i booted up the  game if i've played it before and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,37040,42559,knowing the stanley parable  if you don't know what it is it's it  kind of like messes with your brain
8xfSL0XLRtQ,42559,48640,and there's a narrator playing along  with you and you kind of go against him  or you go with him and it has a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,48640,55360,multiple permutations that you can go  through and it's very very fun so i want  to see what the new game has to offer oh
8xfSL0XLRtQ,55360,61840,my god the end is never the end of the  story of a man named stanley  [Music]
8xfSL0XLRtQ,61840,68000,stanley worked for a company in a big  building where he was employee number  427
8xfSL0XLRtQ,68000,74720,employee number 427's job was simple he  sat at his desk in room 427 and he
8xfSL0XLRtQ,74720,81840,pushed buttons on the keyboard orders  came to him through a monitor on his  desk telling him what buttons to push
8xfSL0XLRtQ,81840,87759,how long to push them and him it's like  severance this is what employee 427 did
8xfSL0XLRtQ,87759,93280,every day of every month of every year  and although others might have
8xfSL0XLRtQ,93280,98960,considered it soul-reading stanley  relished every moment that the orders
8xfSL0XLRtQ,98960,104159,though we have been made exactly for  this job  and stanley
8xfSL0XLRtQ,104159,109280,was happy until  tax season and then one day something
8xfSL0XLRtQ,109280,115680,very peculiar happened  something that would forever change  stanley something he would never quite
8xfSL0XLRtQ,115680,121759,forget  he had been at his desk for nearly an  hour when he realized that not one
8xfSL0XLRtQ,121759,127280,single order had arrived on the monitor  for him to follow  no one had showed up to give him
8xfSL0XLRtQ,127280,134160,instructions call a meeting or even say  hi  never in all his years of the company
8xfSL0XLRtQ,134160,140720,had this happened this complete  isolation  something was very clearly wrong
8xfSL0XLRtQ,140720,146000,shocked frozen solid stanley found  himself unable to move for the longest
8xfSL0XLRtQ,146000,151760,time  but as he came to his wits and regained  his senses he got up from his desk and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,151760,158319,stepped out of his office  okay see this is the type of game now or  if i didn't move the game would actually
8xfSL0XLRtQ,158319,164560,react to that  so let's move around i i can't remember  any of this it's been a really really
8xfSL0XLRtQ,164560,172160,long time you try to remember anything  from eight years ago  you were probably in diapers back then
8xfSL0XLRtQ,172160,177360,all of his co-workers were gone what  could it mean  stanley decided to go to the meeting
8xfSL0XLRtQ,177360,182480,room  had simply missed a memo  no matter how hard stanley looked he
8xfSL0XLRtQ,182480,188640,couldn't find a trace of his co-workers  they're all dead stanley  they've all gone to heaven and left you
8xfSL0XLRtQ,188640,193920,behind because earth is hell  and there's no place more like hell than
8xfSL0XLRtQ,193920,199159,working in an office in a nine-to-five  job
8xfSL0XLRtQ,199599,205200,oh  let's erase that person's entire week's  worth of work  cool
8xfSL0XLRtQ,205200,213000,ah that's fine he's dead anyway  i hate mondays  you and me both pal
8xfSL0XLRtQ,213440,218560,wait  when i'm walking around and i left click
8xfSL0XLRtQ,218560,223760,it sounds like i'm tapping the keyboard  get your first achievement you can't  jump oh yeah there's an achievement for
8xfSL0XLRtQ,223760,229360,playing the original stanley parable if  you don't play the game for five years  you get an achievement and now in this
8xfSL0XLRtQ,229360,234720,ultra deluxe version of the game  it's 10 years you have to not play the  game for 10 years to be able to get that
8xfSL0XLRtQ,234720,239560,achievement  that's wild
8xfSL0XLRtQ,240319,245360,this does not  make sense  sure  okay
8xfSL0XLRtQ,245360,250560,when stanley came to a set of two open  doors he entered the door on his left
8xfSL0XLRtQ,250560,257359,okay for this first run through the game  i'm going to obey the narrator and i'm  going to see where that actually gets us
8xfSL0XLRtQ,257359,263199,and then after that we're going to  disobey the narrator  the narrator the narrator
8xfSL0XLRtQ,263199,266360,the narrator
8xfSL0XLRtQ,269440,275600,uh hello  let me in
8xfSL0XLRtQ,277040,283280,what's happening  anybody
8xfSL0XLRtQ,283280,289360,oh no i'm trapped  yet there was not a single person here
8xfSL0XLRtQ,289360,294960,either oh no feeling a wave of disbelief  stanley decided to go up to his boss's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,294960,300160,office hoping he might find an answer  there oh no it's like a nightmare i'm
8xfSL0XLRtQ,300160,306800,i've  i've had to come and do a powerpoint  presentation for like 15 people and i  don't know what it's about i've had
8xfSL0XLRtQ,306800,312960,actual nightmares like this  do not alter without consulting  whiteboard manager that looks like a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,312960,319440,mess  all of this whiteboard and you put that  there  the whole thing is uh
8xfSL0XLRtQ,319440,326000,is like the shape you need  use it  complete today's unfinished agenda items  right next day's agendas
8xfSL0XLRtQ,326000,333039,reflect what is all this empty space  number of slides on the slides
8xfSL0XLRtQ,334000,340080,oh  god this game is funny the writing in  this game is  some of the best you'll ever find in a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,340080,348319,video game or anywhere  it feels like steven merchant and ricky  gervais wrote a video game
8xfSL0XLRtQ,348479,354720,stanley stepped into the broom closet  but there was nothing here so he turned  around and got back on track you got it
8xfSL0XLRtQ,354720,361199,narrator  do we go upstairs  stanley walked upstairs to his boss's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,361199,368479,office okay  so that's that's three different choices  we could make now we could walk  downstairs here or we could have gone to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,368479,377198,the right door  or go up the stair  i lost track of my own choices
8xfSL0XLRtQ,379039,386720,executive bathroom  yes please  i can poop like a god
8xfSL0XLRtQ,386720,392840,but i hate this wallpaper this would not  make me want to poop  i've got the feeling money's for
8xfSL0XLRtQ,392840,398319,stealing but not yours of course so  that's a lovely purse
8xfSL0XLRtQ,398319,407199,is that a song  extreme bathrooms  time magazines toilet of the year
8xfSL0XLRtQ,407600,413759,you'll never want to poop in anything  else  whoa somebody's got fancy living
8xfSL0XLRtQ,413759,422280,this is so much like aperture as well  and portal  i think it might have been inspired by  that stuff originally
8xfSL0XLRtQ,424800,430000,stanley was once again stunned to  discover not an indication of any human  life
8xfSL0XLRtQ,430000,435360,shocked unraveled stanley wondered in  disbelief who orchestrated this what
8xfSL0XLRtQ,435360,442160,dark secret was being held from him  what he could not have known was that  the keypad behind the boss's desk
8xfSL0XLRtQ,442160,450000,guarded the terrible truth that his boss  had been keeping from him and so the  boss had assigned it an extra secret pin
8xfSL0XLRtQ,450000,455039,number  two eight four five  how do you know that
8xfSL0XLRtQ,455039,462160,stanley couldn't possibly have known  this  yet incredibly by simply pushing random
8xfSL0XLRtQ,462160,467840,buttons on the keypad stanley happened  to input the correct code
8xfSL0XLRtQ,467840,473440,amazing he stepped into the newly opened  passageway
8xfSL0XLRtQ,473680,479280,dude it's like god is my friend  uh i guess god is supposed to be your
8xfSL0XLRtQ,479280,485199,friend  but  i it's like having god as your narrator  guiding you through life could you
8xfSL0XLRtQ,485199,490840,imagine  if you're that precognition to be able  to avoid things or do things
8xfSL0XLRtQ,490840,497599,expertly god i wonder about that all the  time like i'm i'm doing something i'm  like don't eat that because you
8xfSL0XLRtQ,497599,503680,yourself later you know  things like that i want to have that  power
8xfSL0XLRtQ,505199,512879,still got my keyboard with me i see  i wonder if you get an achievement for  clicking enough times i think you do
8xfSL0XLRtQ,519120,526080,i wonder how it's going to flip it on  its head though cause if i've played the  game before clearly the game is going to  recognize that deeper into the building
8xfSL0XLRtQ,526080,531120,stanley realized he felt a bit peculiar  it was a stirring of emotion in his
8xfSL0XLRtQ,531120,539120,chest as though he felt more free to  think for himself to question the nature  of his job why did he feel this now when
8xfSL0XLRtQ,539120,544320,for years it had never occurred to him  this question would not go unanswered
8xfSL0XLRtQ,544320,550399,for long  i love that narrator's voice sean had  woken up
8xfSL0XLRtQ,550399,555760,he went downstairs and had a bowl of  porridge
8xfSL0XLRtQ,555760,563920,my life is not as exciting as stanley's  it's like the curse cassac narrator  the universe is very large
8xfSL0XLRtQ,563920,571279,i want someone like this narrating my  entire life stanley walked straight  ahead through the large door that read  mind control facility now we can escape
8xfSL0XLRtQ,571279,577760,as well  i'm okay with not escaping um i'll go to  the mind control facility uh i like this
8xfSL0XLRtQ,577760,582880,one better  i'll get indoctrinated and go back to my  job
8xfSL0XLRtQ,584000,592240,oh  big shiny button baby want push  what's this say can i zoom
8xfSL0XLRtQ,592240,599360,the lights rose on an enormous room  packed with television screens what  horrible secret did this place hold
8xfSL0XLRtQ,599360,604720,stanley thought to himself did he have  the strength to find out you know what's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,604720,610959,weird about this is that looking at this  i was about to say it's like the  architect's room in the matrix now
8xfSL0XLRtQ,610959,616959,having played this game before i feel  like i've made that joke before and it's  going to be really interesting to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,616959,622800,like watch the parallels between both  playthroughs because i legit don't  remember a thing this is so like the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,622800,628399,matrix  this is like the architect's office and  i wonder if the game's going to play
8xfSL0XLRtQ,628399,634560,into that  like going through another loop of this  having been so long since the last time
8xfSL0XLRtQ,634560,640079,i don't know  i'm very curious to see how it handles  it
8xfSL0XLRtQ,643600,650160,employee observation protocol  okay  ooh
8xfSL0XLRtQ,650160,655440,now the monitors jumped oh god my true  nature revealed each bore the number of
8xfSL0XLRtQ,655440,661519,an employee in the building that's so  cool  the lives of so many individuals reduced
8xfSL0XLRtQ,661519,667440,to images on a screen and stanley one of  them eternally monitored in this place
8xfSL0XLRtQ,667440,672959,where freedom meant nothing i'm 427  aren't i  that's going to be me right there show
8xfSL0XLRtQ,672959,680320,me  that's it  that's my desk  that's so cool i'm on tv
8xfSL0XLRtQ,680320,688399,wow  i get to be a i'm a celebrity look at me  go  stanley you're awesome
8xfSL0XLRtQ,688399,694079,this mind control facility it was too  horrible to believe it couldn't be true
8xfSL0XLRtQ,694079,700880,had stanley really been under someone's  control all this time was this the only  reason he was happy with his boring job
8xfSL0XLRtQ,700880,708160,that his emotions had been manipulated  to accept it blindly  i'm all i'm still under control our
8xfSL0XLRtQ,708160,713839,whole lives are controlled am i in  control of myself  am i in control of you you don't know
8xfSL0XLRtQ,713839,721600,this was recorded in the past you're  watching this right now but it was  recorded days ago and you have no idea
8xfSL0XLRtQ,721600,727360,about that until i just said it  right  i'm in total control of you
8xfSL0XLRtQ,727360,732480,subscribe hit like  see you did it or if you're already
8xfSL0XLRtQ,732480,737920,subscribed that means you did it in a  previous loop already this is getting  weird
8xfSL0XLRtQ,737920,743360,he refused to believe it he couldn't  accept it pirate his own life in someone
8xfSL0XLRtQ,743360,748880,else's control  never it was unthinkable wasn't it was
8xfSL0XLRtQ,748880,757040,it even possible  had he truly spent his entire life  utterly blind to the world
8xfSL0XLRtQ,757040,764000,crazy world lots of smells i would be  blind to most of it as well  the heart of the operation controls
8xfSL0XLRtQ,764000,771600,labeled with emotions happy or sad or  content  walking eating working all of it
8xfSL0XLRtQ,771600,779200,monitored and commanded from this very  place and as the cold reality of his  past began to sink in stanley decided
8xfSL0XLRtQ,779200,784240,that this machinery would never again  exert its terrible power over another
8xfSL0XLRtQ,784240,789279,human life  for he would dismantle the controls once
8xfSL0XLRtQ,789279,795120,and for all  will i though
8xfSL0XLRtQ,795200,801839,what if i just want a cushy existence  where i'm being controlled by somebody  else and then i don't have to think for  myself the amount of thinking i have to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,801839,806880,do for myself every day it's exhausting  i don't want to have to make every
8xfSL0XLRtQ,806880,813440,decision for myself  i hate it  one
8xfSL0XLRtQ,813440,820160,two  little button up there  what number are you
8xfSL0XLRtQ,820160,826639,i will never know  make yourself known  buttons stanley wandered around looking
8xfSL0XLRtQ,826639,834560,for the number four  but he could not find it  for he was stupid
8xfSL0XLRtQ,837519,843320,oh mind controls idle awaiting input
8xfSL0XLRtQ,844399,851600,i can just turn it off and when at last  he found the source of the room's power  he knew it was his duty his obligation
8xfSL0XLRtQ,851600,858160,to put an end to this horrible place and  to everything it stood for
8xfSL0XLRtQ,859120,864560,if i turn it off the game's probably  going to end because i severed control
8xfSL0XLRtQ,869120,876250,i might have just killed myself though  [Music]
8xfSL0XLRtQ,876639,882800,is that one ending blackness  and a rising chill of uncertainty
8xfSL0XLRtQ,882800,888480,was it over  i'm out into the world for the first  time by myself
8xfSL0XLRtQ,888480,893680,yes  he had won  he had defeated the machine
8xfSL0XLRtQ,893680,899600,unshackled himself from someone else's  command freedom was mere moments away
8xfSL0XLRtQ,899600,906880,but at what cost and yet  even as the immense door slowly opened  stanley reflected on how many puzzles
8xfSL0XLRtQ,906880,913839,still lay unsolved  where had his co-workers gone  how had he been freed from the machine's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,913839,919360,grasp wow the mysteries did this strange  building windows background sunlight
8xfSL0XLRtQ,919360,926639,streamed into the chamber he realized  none of this mattered to him for it was  not knowledge or even the power that he
8xfSL0XLRtQ,926639,932800,had been seeking  but happiness wow perhaps his goal had  not been to understand
8xfSL0XLRtQ,932800,938560,but to let go  no longer would anyone tell him where to  go what to do
8xfSL0XLRtQ,938560,944480,or how to feel full control whatever  life he lives it will be his
8xfSL0XLRtQ,944480,950079,and that was all he needed to know  it was perhaps the only thing worth
8xfSL0XLRtQ,950079,955480,knowing  stanley steps i'm in ireland
8xfSL0XLRtQ,955839,962079,oh this is just ireland there's probably  sheep somewhere  these stone walls that can only be
8xfSL0XLRtQ,962079,966120,ireland or the north of england
8xfSL0XLRtQ,969519,976480,wait my whole computer just froze  okay that's this got too real it it
8xfSL0XLRtQ,976480,981160,froze and crashed my whole computer
8xfSL0XLRtQ,985839,992399,um  maybe that was just parts of the game  maybe i got so in tune with reality
8xfSL0XLRtQ,992399,998000,that  the game just crashed  oh
8xfSL0XLRtQ,998000,1004000,it's thanking me for setting the clock  that's how i know that you care about  this experience you're paying attention
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1004000,1009199,i don't even have any way of knowing if  the times you're setting are correct  tell you what i'll make you a deal
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1009199,1014240,since you've been so cooperative next  time you boot up the game and see the  screen just set the clock to your
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1014240,1020079,favorite time  go ahead pick whichever time you want  even if it's not the correct time you've
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1020079,1026720,earned it alright i'll let you get back  to the video game now  oh this is so weird
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1026720,1032160,this is messing with my brain  the fact that this screen is on this and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1032160,1037918,it's all real  the end is never the end is never the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1037918,1043120,end is never the end this is the story  of a man okay
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1043199,1048960,i'm in control again welcome back  is that just the ending to the last one  and it just crashed at the end i hope i
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1048960,1054640,didn't miss anything  all of his co-workers were gone what
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1054640,1061679,could it be  stanley decided to go to the this time  perhaps we're going to go through the  right door
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1061679,1066880,not the wrong door ha  get it
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1066880,1072400,when stanley came to a set of two  openings no buddy he entered the door  and he's this was not the correct way to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1072400,1078799,the meeting room and stanley knew it  perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop  by the employee lounge first just to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1078799,1086320,admire it no i want to  upset the established order i want to go  against the system i want to break free
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1086320,1093280,of my shackles  from the hierarchy of capitalism
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1093280,1098480,i want to be my own person yes truly a  room worth admiring it had really been
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1098480,1104880,worth the detour after all just to spend  a few moments here in this immaculate  beautifully constructed room
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1104880,1113600,stanley simply stood here drinking it  all in this is prop hunt  that box over there is actually a person
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1113919,1120720,but eager to get back to business  stanley took the first open door on his  left nope i'm going against everything
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1120720,1126880,he says because he's trying to course  correct me  stanley was so bad at following
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1126880,1133200,directions it's incredible he wasn't  five years ago  do not lie if you are lying right now
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1133200,1138320,stop  just stop it get some help
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1139039,1145039,okay some of this is coming back to me  like these locations they they look  familiar i remember something about a

8xfSL0XLRtQ,1313039,1320240,the first place my broken rooms exposed  developer textures is this what you'd  wanted was it worth ruining the entire
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1320240,1327440,story i'd written out specifically for  you  do you not think i put a lot of time  into that because i did and in the end
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1327440,1333760,it was all for nothing because this is  what you wanted to see help me here  stanley help elucidate these strange and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1333760,1342159,unknowable desires of yours what would  have made this game better what did you  want to see vehicles skill trees work
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1342159,1347760,with me you've given me absolutely  nothing so far  tell you what let me take a stab in the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1347760,1354240,dark at a new design and you can give me  some feedback  there we go a third option this already

8xfSL0XLRtQ,1366559,1373360,okay i'm going to stop you there now  tell me about your experience with this  new version would you say that the game
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1373360,1378400,benefited from allowing you more choices  feel free to be honest i'm looking for
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1378400,1383600,some real critical feedback here  is five like yes hard agree
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1383600,1388799,um and one is like wouldn't agree at all  uh because i'm gonna give you a one

8xfSL0XLRtQ,1393919,1400240,you saw ways the game could be improved  to more fully express itself  mechanically and artistically but a one
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1400240,1405919,that's not even  what am i supposed to do with that  oh but i guess it isn't my place to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1405919,1411520,judge  here based on the data from your  previous playthrough i've compiled a new
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1411520,1418480,version and to be perfectly candid i  think i've knocked it out of the park  with this one let's take a look
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1418480,1425600,wait  based on my previous  like  run in this version of the game or like
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1425600,1431360,having played the original game  oh my god there's actual leaderboards

8xfSL0XLRtQ,1462000,1467760,21 percent of players skipped the intro  sequence only the worst three percent of  players chose the blue door 98.9 of
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1467760,1474080,players are i didn't even get to read  that  the one me percent of players can't read  fast enough how long does it take you to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1474080,1479840,get to the correct door  uh i'm not going to the correct door i'm  going through this one now
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1480720,1488080,now would you say that competitive  leaderboard helped you feel motivated to  keep walking through doors again honest
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1488080,1493840,answers please that's really smart now  they're taking a stab at  like other games that are like here
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1493840,1499440,here's a leaderboard now you want to  play the game more huh  like how ubisoft games are always like

8xfSL0XLRtQ,1504720,1510559,it's bad to begin with  hey i nearly forgot i've got a prototype  of a new game i've been working on and

8xfSL0XLRtQ,1523760,1530720,click the button to move him back to the  right and if he reaches the fire you  fail okay it's a very meaningful game
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1530720,1538000,all about the desperation and tedium of  endlessly confronting the demands of  family life i think the art world will
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1538000,1544400,really take notice but of course the  message of the game only becomes clear  once you've been playing it for about
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1544400,1550880,four hours so why don't you give it four  hours of play to make sure it's  effective be sure to keep notes on your
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1550880,1559520,experience got it got it got it  [Music]  burn the baby burn the baby let the baby
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1559520,1566240,burn  bastard  do it because you hate babies or purely  despite me both because if it's the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1566240,1571919,latter well i don't know what to do i'm  completely out of ideas i can't think of  a single thing that might improve the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1571919,1577200,experience for me  i'm not even going to try i'm out i'm  out i'm done
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1577200,1582480,it's over oh thank you for playing your  input was extremely valuable oh hey
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1582480,1587520,since my game was so awful why don't we  play someone else's game just to ease  the pain

8xfSL0XLRtQ,1594000,1600799,yes this seems like it'll work let's  give it a shot fortnite
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1601360,1607919,oh my god  fascinating what do you think this game  is about stanley what's this fire watch
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1607919,1613679,what is our motivation  hmm to me that you are meant to play as
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1613679,1620240,a creepy man spying on innocent  civilians below you from up high in your  creep tower perhaps for some sort of
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1620240,1626000,twisted erotic purpose  hmm  yes that must be it what a fascinating
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1626000,1632640,venture into the experience of total  mental depravity so far i love  everything about this game stanley and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1632640,1638320,it seems who fire watches the fire watch  out and see what else is out there
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1638320,1644799,it says who who fire watches the fire  watch which is not only  specifically calling out firewatch but
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1644799,1649760,also watchmen  who watches the watchmen
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1652240,1658559,wow  look at it all  hey i liked firewatch
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1658559,1664320,the ending kind of  took me out of it but  i played that game on my channel that
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1664320,1669520,was fun  i want to book it oh there must be a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1669520,1676080,bucket in here somewhere  book it book it book it balls are kind  of like buckets
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1676080,1683679,don't you think  plates are kind of like  balls chlor talks

8xfSL0XLRtQ,1700480,1706320,would be a bucket  if you cupped your hands and peed into  them it would be like a bucket no no no
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1706320,1711520,it can't be  what
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1711520,1718000,it is it's an open world game good god  quickly block it off
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1719279,1724480,thank goodness stanley what a close call  you nearly wandered off into that that
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1724480,1729679,thing that big open just wandering  around no right or wrong directions no
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1729679,1736799,path to follow you can just go in any  [Music]  oh  thank heavens we avoided it
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1736799,1743679,we're out of the woods now standing  okay literally to get us out of here  let's find another game okay preferably
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1743679,1750320,something with walls something with nice  big insurmountable walls
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1750320,1758480,wall game  okay  i think this will be just the thing
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1759279,1766320,that's rocket league wonderful see this  is exactly what i had in mind oh dude  just a nice big box for you to run
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1766320,1772640,around in there isn't any possibility  that you could get lost here now so cool  is game design
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1772640,1779200,stanley if you manage to get lost in  this game i will be phenomenally  impressed oh i'll do it
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1779200,1785279,you don't think i stupid but me do okay  so what exactly do we do here let's see
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1785279,1790320,i'm gonna fall in the whole car's here  in the back but obviously there's no  race track okay i'm seeing that there's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1790320,1795760,a ball of some kind back here is this  game sports ball stanley i think it's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1795760,1801360,sports ball i love sports ball  we should run the bases and do a  touchdown together
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1801360,1807200,yes i think surely we must can i score  goals stanley here's the ball have fun
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1807200,1813360,god that's terrifying  boosh  this would be so much better if i was a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1813360,1820030,car with rockets strapped to the back of  me  right now i'm just a slow
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1820030,1825600,[Music]  five middle-aged  you're doing it are you winning is this  fun is it better than my miserable
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1825600,1832480,little story that i worked so hard on oh  yeah stanley i have a thought and i  realize i'm not a sports ologist but if
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1832480,1837600,one ball generates a certain amount of  raw adrenal ten balls and surely
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1837600,1844559,multiple balls makes for an even more  euphoric sports experience  and now we're cooking here comes another
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1844559,1851520,ball  i'm so fast now oh goodness that really  does feel amazing doesn't it another one
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1851520,1859120,stanley i'm like a child in a  confectionary shop i simply have to have  more i'm insatiable balls

8xfSL0XLRtQ,1865440,1871039,rocket league baby they should add a  mode like this in rocket league  you know when you play those air hockey
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1871039,1876159,games and some of them have like  20 pucks  and then it's about just scoring
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1876159,1881279,randomly the pac-man one  is this a real video game yeah well i
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1881279,1887360,sure hope you're having a good time  because guess what it's over no  all right your little fun comes to an
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1887360,1893760,end this is my game and what i say goes  you get to have fun when i let hold on
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1893760,1899840,what are you doing  i broke it i knew i could
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1900320,1907440,danny don't do that i can't follow you  there i can't help you  how will you write a story without me  you can't do it you know that stanley
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1907440,1913279,come back  i'm not listening because i can't read
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1913279,1919120,okay fine i'll go my own way i'll make  my own story  i know i said i didn't want to make
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1919120,1926000,choices for myself but now i i am and i  do  and i oh
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1926720,1935440,i was given control for five seconds and  i fell off and died  i'm just a child in a adult mech
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1935440,1941279,i'm convinced  there's nothing about me that is  adult-like
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1941760,1947519,this is so cool though all jokes aside  the  the level of detail that needs to be
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1947519,1953200,done to not only  create all of this but to write around  it as well to have it all make sense and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1953200,1958399,all flow and all happen back to back  to kind of
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1958399,1965440,sort of  uh  like predict what the player is gonna do  and then right around that is a really
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1965440,1971840,really  detail-oriented thing to do  and to have it all be interesting as  well
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1971840,1976880,incredible game design  i wish i was smart enough to be able to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1976880,1982559,do something like this oh it's my office  but in a different version
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1984480,1991360,what is this  i've made it to nasa  oh i'ma hit the nukes
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1991360,1998159,surely nasa have nukes they make rockets  right  i'm sure elon musk is just one more
8xfSL0XLRtQ,1998159,2003840,social media platform by away from just  creating a  a missile
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2003840,2009039,technically already owns a missile silo  oh god i i'm sorry
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2009360,2015840,if what he wanted was to be the leading  man in his own story well perhaps he's  gotten it down in wherever he is right
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2015840,2021120,now  i wonder if he's happy with his choice  not really he's learned the heavy cost
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2021120,2027039,that comes with it  he'll understand soon what i was trying  to tell him  he needs me
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2027039,2033279,someone who will wrap everything up at  the end to make sense out of the chaos  and the fear and the confusion that's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2033279,2039200,who i am that is what i mean to this  world oh yes yes i'll be back there's no
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2039200,2045279,other way  once this ends after it all comes to a  close then i'll be back
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2045279,2052878,the end will be here soon  very soon  i can wait
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2052878,2059118,but i can't baby's impatient and wants  bucket  where can i find a bucket i really want
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2059118,2065200,to see what the pocket ending is  [Music]  is this just restarting or am i in the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2065200,2071520,same loop  all of his co-workers were gone what  could it mean  stanley decided to go to the meeting
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2071520,2077839,room perhaps he had simply missed okay  what's crazy about that is that there  were other ways that i could have gotten
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2077839,2085760,off like follow the cargo lift across  sure go through the red door  do the baby thing rate five on the games
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2085760,2091358,and the feedback  then actually wait to see what he was  going to do with rocket league
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2091358,2097280,there's so many permutations that i  could have gone through and just that  one alone that i'm like god where do i  start now
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2097280,2103680,i'll go through this now and see if i  can turn the mind control machine back  on maybe
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2103680,2109839,or just see what happens let's see where  we go maybe go downstairs yet there was  not a single person here either yeah
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2109839,2115359,stocks are down a wave of disbelief see  this fourth quarter yeah we want this to  be different
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2115359,2119760,hoping he might find it uh drink top of  the morning coffee
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2121200,2128240,okay i don't want to go in the broom  closet again oh my belly's doing  rumblies i'm so hungry  coming to a staircase stanley walked
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2128240,2133599,upstairs to his boss's office no he  didn't he went downstairs into hell
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2134240,2140960,but stanley just couldn't do it he  considered the possibility of facing his  boss admitting he had left his post
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2140960,2146079,during work hours he might be fired for  that and in such a competitive economy
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2146079,2151760,why had he taken that risk all because  he believed everyone had vanished his
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2151760,2159119,boss i think he was crazy  and then something occurred to stanley  maybe he thought to himself maybe i am
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2159119,2166720,crazy  all of my co-workers blinking  mysteriously out of existence in a  single moment for no reason
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2166720,2171920,none of it made any logical sense and  everything's repeated he stanley  pondered this he began to make other
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2171920,2177280,strange observations for example why  couldn't he see his feet when he looked
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2177280,2182480,oh god why did doors close automatically  behind him what is happening
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2182480,2188640,and for that matter these rooms were  starting to look pretty familiar were  they simply repeating oh my god i'm
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2188640,2193839,having existential dreads too strange  this can't be real and at last he came
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2193839,2200760,to the conclusion that had been on the  tip of his tongue he just hadn't found  the i'm not real
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2200760,2207680,[Music]  sure what a relief stanley felt to have
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2207680,2213440,finally found an answer an explanation  his co-workers weren't actually gone he
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2213440,2219680,wasn't going to lose his job he wasn't  crazy after all  so feel crazy i suppose i'll wake up
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2219680,2224720,soon i'll have to go back to my boring  real-life job pushing buttons i may as
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2224720,2230720,well enjoy this while i'm still lucid  so he imagined himself flying and began
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2230720,2236320,to gently float above the ground oh god  then he imagined himself soaring through
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2236320,2242880,space on a magical starfield and it too  appeared it was so much fun and stanley
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2242880,2249200,motherboard that he had still not woken  up dude i ate  something for lunch and then perhaps the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2249200,2257200,strangest question of them all entered  stanley's head one he was amazed he  hadn't asked himself sooner why is there
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2257200,2264400,a voice in my head dictating everything  that i'm doing and i think that all the  time now the voice was describing itself
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2264400,2272079,being considered by stanley who found it  particularly strange who's getting too  mad  about a voice describing me thinking
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2272079,2277440,about how it's describing my thoughts oh  baby brain goes boom
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2277440,2282640,and wondered if this voice spoke to all  people in their dreams the truth was  that of course
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2282640,2287760,this was not a dream how could it be  was stanley simply deceiving himself
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2287760,2295200,believing that if he's asleep he doesn't  have to take responsibility for himself  stanley is as awake right now as he's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2295200,2301599,ever been in his life don't feel awake  now hearing the voice speak these words  was quite a shock to stanley
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2301599,2308079,after all he knew for certain beyond a  doubt that this was in fact a dream did  the voice not see him flow to make the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2308079,2313520,magical stars just a moment ago how else  would the voice explain all that  simulation this voice was a part of
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2313520,2320320,himself too surely surely if he could  just  he would prove it he would prove that he
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2320320,2326560,was in control that this was a dream  so he closed his eyes gently
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2326560,2332400,and he invited himself to wake up wake  up sally he felt the cool weight of the  blanket on his skin
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2332400,2337760,the press of the mattress on his back  the fresh air of a world outside this
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2337760,2342880,one  me wake up  he thought to himself
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2342880,2349200,i'm through with this dream  i wish it to be over  let me go back to my job
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2349200,2354480,let me continue pushing the buttons  please it's all i want
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2354480,2361920,i want my apartment and my wife we're  married my job  all i want is my life exactly the way
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2361920,2368560,it's always been  my life is normal  i am normal
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2368560,2376320,everything will be fine sounds like you  have anxiety stanley i am  okay this is how most people think every
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2376320,2381520,single day  existing is terrible in this modern
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2381520,2388400,world i'm convinced everybody has  anxiety screaming please someone wake me  up
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2389599,2397320,i am real the nine to five has gotten to  me i am real i must be real everything's  turning red
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2397760,2402800,i'm not getting paid enough  and everything went black
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2403920,2409680,i died  i asked for a pay raise and i got to  kill the story of a woman named mariela
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2409680,2414720,what  mariella woke up on a day like any other
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2414720,2419839,she arose got dressed gathered  and walked to her place of work
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2419839,2426480,but on this particular day her walk was  interrupted by the body of a man who had  stumbled through town talking and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2426480,2432160,screaming to himself and then collapsed  dead on the sidewalk  and although she would soon turn to go
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2432160,2440560,call for an ambulance for just a few  brief moments she considered the strange  man he was obviously crazy this one she
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2440560,2446000,knew  everyone knows what crazy people look  like and in that moment she thought to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2446000,2453280,herself how lucky she was to be normal  i am saying  i am incredible oh she has no idea
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2453280,2459359,i know what is real and what isn't  it was comforting to think this and in a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2459359,2464480,certain way seeing this man made her  feel better  but then she remembered the meeting she
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2464480,2471280,had scheduled for that day the very  important people whose impressions of  her would affect her career and by
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2471280,2476480,extension the rest of her life  she had no time for this so it was only
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2476480,2484078,a moment that she stood there staring  down at the body  and then she turned and ran
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2485760,2491200,oh my god it's so good  and i'm back in my office hey i didn't
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2491200,2496960,die it was all a dream  all of his co-workers were gone i'm  gonna escape this time

8xfSL0XLRtQ,2733520,2739599,that's it  oh you've got to be kidding me you see  stanley this is what happens when greedy
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2739599,2746319,video game developers with no respect  for their fan base rush a cheap  expansion to market for no reason other
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2746319,2753119,than to make an easy job right and don't  get me started on the level of  craftsmanship that's gone into it in  fact i'm looking right now at the game's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2753119,2759200,achievements and it's hard to believe  one of them actually says test  achievement please ignore does the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2759200,2765760,quality assurance department signed off  on this i'm infuriated and i'm offended  and i i intend to find these people on
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2765760,2771520,twitter and hold them personally  accountable  it's my fault stanley i built up too
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2771520,2777440,much anticipation around the new content  i'm afraid it could never have lived up  to such expectations
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2777440,2783839,if you're still with me why don't we  just reset the game and we'll try to get  back to what the stanley parable is
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2783839,2788960,really about  no frills no gimmicks just you and me
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2788960,2795359,having a great time together like always  that's awesome what do you say friend

8xfSL0XLRtQ,2835280,2841920,unsatisfying the new ultra deluxe  content turned out to be got me thinking  about the past and how much better the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2841920,2848800,stanley parable used to be so i made  something special and tucked it away  here where the game's developers went
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2848800,2854720,fine  just our little secret  take a look yeah
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2854720,2859838,i miss when jacksepticeye used to be  better
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2860960,2867440,this is awesome though  whoa  i call it the memory zone
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2867440,2874720,it's where i've been storing all my  favorite memories so i can relive the  peak experiences of my life whenever i
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2874720,2881440,want smart experiences like the launch  of the stanley parable on pc
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2881680,2887838,is it going to be like the devs reaction  to how people reacted to the game
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2889920,2897119,2013 when the stanley parable was  released  memory sweet memory don't forget
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2897119,2903200,the stanley parable  you see stanley doesn't the memory zone  remind you of how wonderful stanley
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2903200,2910079,parable was before it was solid with a  cheap re-release  remember back in october
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2910079,2917599,the game originally launched back then  video games had integrity  back then it all meant something
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2917599,2924720,oh the waste  it's a bafta the british academy of film  and television awards for
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2924720,2930640,bruce straley and neil druckmann for the  last of us  but he's based at the stanley parable

8xfSL0XLRtQ,2952880,2958880,wasn't it like a thing and then they  remade it and then it came out as like  okay we we reworked it and we redid it
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2958880,2964480,the game's like fully finished and it's  like a whole complete experience now and  that was the stanley parable in 2013 and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2964480,2969680,now they've re-released it  god i  maybe it's beating a dead horse but i
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2969680,2975040,honestly hope they take like five years  and re-release it again
8xfSL0XLRtQ,2975040,2981280,good times oh  i remember wall and door

8xfSL0XLRtQ,3053440,3060240,and over french is where i keep reviews  of the stanley parable like this  stunning triumph of games journalism 10
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3060240,3066800,out of 10 from  destructoid.com james stephanie sterling  right
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3066800,3074319,we're so many games that aspire to be  more than games end up less than any  form of art stanley parable strives and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3074319,3080000,then succeeds to be every game ever  created did you hear that stanley every
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3080000,3085200,game ever created that's how grand and  all-encompassing the original stanley
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3085200,3091040,parable was it was literally every game  ever created it was skyrim it was
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3091040,3097280,persona 3 it was all of them and now  it's nothing  it's no games at all
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3097280,3102400,it isn't even the stanley parable  anymore it's just a husk now
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3102400,3108880,a lifeless husk with an hour of new  elevator content
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3108880,3115839,this is so smart  this is how you do a remake
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3115839,3122559,oh what's out here  memory zone maintenance  oh i want to maintain my memories my
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3122559,3128720,gray matter is down there  person of the year  you
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3129119,3135359,oh  it's stanley and mariella  was her name  already forgot this is how it was made
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3135359,3138759,all the buttons
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3141280,3144559,this is so clever
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3147920,3154960,the greatest wealth is memory the end is  never the end is never the end here's  another moving passage this time from
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3154960,3161520,gamespot.com  the stanley parable is both a richly  stimulating commentary on the nature of
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3161520,3168079,choice in games and one that offers some  of the most enjoyable surprising and  rewarding choices i've ever been
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3168079,3175440,confronted with in a game nine out of  ten don't you get it stanley the game  was perfect it didn't need anything else
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3175440,3180559,it didn't need new content it just  needed to be left alone
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3180559,3188640,to spend the rest of time collecting  dust in the hallowed hall of beloved  video game memories
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3189200,3196079,oh red and blue door i miss those guys  the serious room
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3196079,3203040,wait i want to go in  [Music]  dang it
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3203040,3209640,oh i thought these were stairs oh that  mess with my brain  can i not
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3209839,3215760,wait where do i go narrator oh  these were simpler time standing
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3215760,3221040,but i wouldn't give to go back to have  it all over again  wait
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3221040,3228160,hang on i don't recall this part of the  memory zone before  what's this what's down here oh god this
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3228160,3230960,is ravenholm
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3233920,3239200,oh no oh god no stanley it's a  collection of reviews from steam
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3239200,3245599,online video game distributor i haven't  looked at these in years oh no i can't  even imagine what's been collecting down
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3245599,3252559,here  surely these reviews were glowing as  well weren't they  oh god it's like finding youtube
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3252559,3257760,comments  honestly i could not be bothered to play
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3257760,3264720,this game to full completion the  narrator is obnoxious and unfunny  with his humor and dialogue proving to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3264720,3271280,be more irritating than entertaining i'm  funny  i'm not trying to be funny i'm trying to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3271280,3277200,make a serious work of art i suppose i  could write up a handful of gags to  insert into the stanley parable but the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3277200,3283680,game is already such a densely layered  web a profound philosophical insight  that i can't even imagine where i'd have
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3283680,3289119,the room to stick them  yeah  so much feedback takes up too much
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3289119,3294640,memory  this is interesting though i do like  that they're taking a stab at this and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3294640,3300640,talking about kind of like video game  culture and reviews and things  in general  because reviews are a weird thing
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3300640,3306160,they're literally just someone's opinion  of something  that you could have loved that they
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3306160,3312240,absolutely hated  like the amount of videos i've uploaded  even on my channel  the amount of people who probably hate
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3312240,3317440,them  and then it makes you question like oh  man but i love it should i hate it as
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3317440,3325440,well no enjoy the things you want to  love  who  absolutely cares i've had people be like
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3325440,3331040,i got made fun of for watching  jacksepticeye in my 20s because everyone  thinks he's like for kids like
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3331040,3336240,really  just do whatever you want man have fun
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3336559,3343520,but as someone who creates things  like every day  this this is really fascinating to me
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3343520,3348640,because this thing this type of stuff  really got to me in the past if people  said something negative or positive like
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3348640,3353839,i hung on every single word that  everybody was saying  and now it's like yeah some people are
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3353839,3362240,going to like it some people aren't  going to like it i just kind of want to  do what i enjoy and hopefully people  still watch at the end of the day
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3362240,3367680,okay let's see what this one says  while the idea for the game is good
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3367680,3376079,for someone who prefers non-linear games  this preachiness gets annoying fast  richie stanley i'm not preachy am i you
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3376079,3383040,can tell me if i'm preachy honestly you  can oh goodness this is actually quite  shocking for me but i always will to be
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3383040,3389599,honest i had always thought of the  game's dialogue as being rather tears to  begin with you can't know how much fluff
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3389599,3397040,i cut from the game to get it to feel as  light and airy as it well i almost  thought it did but maybe it wasn't
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3397040,3402960,yeah  what an awful memory to have to hold on  to  these black marks are my otherwise
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3402960,3408559,unimpeachable track record  i feel  like a failure
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3408559,3416799,like i let these people down  perhaps the stanley parable isn't quite  as sterling as i always remembered
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3416799,3424079,no it's great it's amazing  yeah i wonder how many people don't like  the game just for the narrator
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3424079,3430319,and there's like that british accent i  hate british accents  what's this one these are all negatives
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3430319,3436720,though  you constantly have to stop doing  anything so the narrator can catch up
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3436720,3443920,with his long-winded explanations of  what's happening  i wish there was a skip button
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3443920,3451040,a skip button  well well yes yes i think we can do that  if i'm truly too preachy then then maybe
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3451040,3456880,letting you skip ahead for just a moment  surely it couldn't hurt  not if it means we can strike these
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3456880,3462880,negative reviews from the record  certainly positive reviews of the  stanley barrel wow
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3462880,3470720,and it's always been my motto i'd do  anything for the customer standard yes a  skip button we shall have
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3470720,3476400,it is interesting though that  i mean  it's like joking about stuff but it is
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3476400,3483119,true how the negative ones are the ones  that we're reading and we're going  through and are in the memory and you  can see all the positive reviews
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3483119,3488480,are blurred out and they're tossed aside  because if people like the thing you  make then you don't have to please them
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3488480,3493920,anymore because they're already happy  with it so it's all of this negativity  that sticks with you because you're
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3493920,3499119,trying to appease that you're trying to  fix it you're trying to figure out why  something went wrong because that's the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3499119,3505040,feedback that you can work on if  something's good then it's like well i  don't have any i don't have any friction  i don't have anything to work against i
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3505040,3512079,don't have anything to like fix  and here it is go ahead and give it a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3512079,3519040,shot i'll pop you  oh  oh you're back you see you were only
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3519040,3525040,frozen in time for a few minutes but it  was plenty of time for me to deliver a  long rambling monologue full of
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3525040,3532240,unnecessary verbal flourishes and  lengthy ruminations on the nature of  choice in video games of course i happen
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3532240,3538160,to believe it was perhaps one of my more  profound such ruminations not that of  course yeah we're going to skip again
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3538160,3543760,just to see what happens  oh well there's sport you really did
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3543760,3549359,catch me rambling on a bit didn't you  but that's the power of the button the  minute i start to go off on a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3549359,3555839,thoughtless display of self-absorption  it's right at your fingertips to go poof  and it's all over oh i can't wait to see
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3555839,3561119,what cooking is and whether they'll edit  the rating of their steam review or at
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3561119,3566160,least change some of the wording i'm  sure they'll add it to the last i don't  even know if one can change their review
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3566160,3572079,in the first place i guess i should  become better educated oh exactly can  you delete your review and it changes
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3572079,3577119,the ratings that would have been the  smart thing to check on before i went  about this whole exercise of making the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3577119,3585119,skip button  although i have to imagine that after  seeing this exciting new technology at  work surely whoever it is runs steam
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3585119,3590799,will instantly run out and implement a  new feature to make it possible to edit  one
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3590799,3596079,okay welcome back stanley now i should  say that the amount of time the button  has been skipping through is becoming
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3596079,3602559,longer and longer that last one was well  i want to say maybe 30 45 minutes it's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3602559,3608559,not unendurable by any means but it's  well there's really only so much i can i  wonder if it was very much i know it's
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3608559,3615520,shocking isn't it but at any rate i do  suggest that we not press the button  again i think the skip button has been
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3615520,3621200,added  and we  stanley stanley stanley please don't
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3621200,3626799,push the button again it's been 12 hours  jesus you've just been frozen there i
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3626799,3632000,don't know why the skips are getting  longer but they're really truly getting  long oh my god i'm gonna skip to the end
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3632000,3638799,of time  you're back  you're back oh my goodness i have  someone to talk to again
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3638799,3646240,stanley i i think it's been a week oh my  god this is gonna get really trippy i've  been sitting here
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3648079,3653440,oh no  oh  hello it's you you're here again welcome
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3653440,3660880,i have had time to think about you and  about us and about everything how long  has it been i've had so much time i
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3660880,3667280,stopped keeping track after a year have  you ever sat down in one place and not  moved for one entire year let me
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3667280,3672880,describe it for you to begin with there  is only regret there is only the turning
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3672880,3679839,wheel of missed opportunities i want to  get to the end of time  i want to skip like a thousand years and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3679839,3684520,walk outside and see everything be  destroyed
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3686400,3690960,he's not even here anymore oh no did he  die
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3695520,3702720,oh god  this is so cool
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3703280,3708880,but they didn't understand that was  never meant to be funny was meant to  have a point it was meant to speak to
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3708880,3714559,the human condition but where are the  jokes where are the jokes they bemoan  they screamed they gnashed their teeth
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3714559,3722640,and said entertain us it wasn't enough  they had to leave a pathetic little  thumbnail cool sorry bro
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3723359,3728160,i want to see like the paint decay and  the walls crumble
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3730079,3735280,good to know the reviews still affect  him after what like 30 years
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3735280,3741039,the end is never the end is never the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3741600,3744639,[Music]
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3749760,3755838,nothing physically is changing anymore  oh
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3757440,3763280,oh guys this is going to fill up with  water  yes
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3763280,3769838,this is what i wanted  this is sick
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3771359,3777680,i love this idea  this is right up my alley
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3778559,3784640,god  i'm gonna skip so much time we're going  to kill god himself
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3787280,3793280,whoa  dude it's exactly like aperture now in  portal 2 when you uh
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3793280,3798480,you're asleep for  the hundreds of thousands of years
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3800640,3807119,oh jesus  so if we skipped like  minutes  then a week then a year
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3807119,3812720,then it's probably like five years then  20 then 100 and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3812720,3816559,probably thousands of years in the  future now
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3821599,3825160,what was that
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3827920,3833599,it's a million years in the future and  bat creatures have reigned supreme
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3834160,3841119,why not the button broke  we can't skip anymore
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3841280,3844160,wait let me just make sure
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3847839,3855119,okay  oh no
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3855119,3860240,life as i know it has ceased to exist
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3860240,3864680,how did that room survive though
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3867599,3873520,and no matter how much time has passed  and how much existence has ended
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3873520,3879760,those negative reviews are still going  to be in my brain why didn't he think it  was funny
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3879760,3886400,he got his skip button and now he's  still not happy  and he didn't say sorry
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3886400,3892160,he didn't come back years later and be  like oh you've changed things are  different
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3892799,3897839,i'm sorry i said negative things in the  past that actually affected you as a  person in your day-to-day life and gave
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3897839,3904640,you stress and anxiety  no sorry  oh hey we're back
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3905119,3910480,is this before the reviews this is 2013  right as the game came out maybe that  review hasn't been written yet all right
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3910480,3916000,well i'm gonna leave this episode here i  think there's so much more that we can  delve into with this i'm gonna try and
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3916000,3921760,get a couple of more endings in the next  episode  um i still there's i'm gonna get a
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3921760,3927440,bucket i swear i'm gonna find a bucket  uh but this game is absolutely
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3927440,3932480,incredible one of the the original 2013  version which i guess is not the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3932480,3938640,original was already so good so  incredible and so memorable and it was  one of those games that i remember so
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3938640,3945039,fondly because i love meta stuff i love  when things kind of like play with their  own narratives and kind of like break
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3945039,3951920,things  um and talk directly to the audience and  break the fourth wall  and this was like the epitome of that
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3951920,3958240,and it was just so smart and clever and  funny and well written and this is even  better than that was
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3958240,3965680,um so that's really impressive i'm  surprised that there is so much more new  content to it that uh kind of plays into
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3965680,3971520,that aspect of you playing it previously  and like poking in its own reviews it's  so genius
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3971520,3977599,uh the people who made this game should  be very very proud of themselves um and  hopefully you guys enjoyed it as well i
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3977599,3982799,i absolutely adore it and i'm gonna play  another video on it so make sure you  subscribe so you're up to date when the
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3982799,3990720,next video comes out and if you did  enjoy this one let me know down in the  comments below what you thought about it  and if you've still been here since 2013
8xfSL0XLRtQ,3990720,3996880,if you've been watching the channel  uh you watched that original series and  you came all the way back and are now
