gCnJjWRf5dk,130,1980,- This is gonna be quite a short video.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1980,4830,"- Is this $4,000 of Starbucks?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,4830,6093,Are you serious?
gCnJjWRf5dk,7240,8480,"- Hey, LTT,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,8480,9610,"welcome to my crib,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,9610,10580,let's go check it out.
gCnJjWRf5dk,10580,13409,"- Sarah, this is the bathroom."
gCnJjWRf5dk,13409,14460,(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,14460,15817,"That's right, ladies and gentlemen,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,15817,18380,"""Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade"" is back,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,18380,22160,"the one and only Sarah Butt got a $5,000 budget"
gCnJjWRf5dk,22160,25140,"from Intel for the ultimate tech makeover,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,25140,26858,"and we are gonna be checking out,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,26858,28280,"not her front door,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,28280,30380,"for obvious privacy reasons,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,30380,32224,so we used this door.
gCnJjWRf5dk,32224,33980,(both laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,33980,36563,(upbeat music)
gCnJjWRf5dk,46095,47700,"Hey, Arlo, do you wanna come with us?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,47700,49565,"Oh, come here."
gCnJjWRf5dk,49565,50690,(Linus grunting)
gCnJjWRf5dk,50690,52670,- This is gonna be quite a short video.
gCnJjWRf5dk,52670,55730,I present to you my upgrade.
gCnJjWRf5dk,55730,56739,"- Wait, what?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,56740,57940,"- So I got,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,57940,60860,"of course, my 12th Gen Intel CPU."
gCnJjWRf5dk,60860,61693,"- Yeah, got an i-12700K."
gCnJjWRf5dk,61693,65460,"- And then, a $4,000 Starbucks gift card."
gCnJjWRf5dk,65460,67290,- Who signed off on this?
gCnJjWRf5dk,67290,70300,"Is this $4,000 of Starbucks?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,70300,71530,- Of course.
gCnJjWRf5dk,71530,72570,What do you expect?
gCnJjWRf5dk,72570,73403,"I get money,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,73403,74640,"I need coffee, like..."
gCnJjWRf5dk,74640,76310,- Are you serious?
gCnJjWRf5dk,76310,77640,I can't tell.
gCnJjWRf5dk,77640,78473,- I'm not serious.
gCnJjWRf5dk,78473,79518,"- Oh, my God."
gCnJjWRf5dk,79518,80540,(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,80540,83410,"- So this is actually my regular setup,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,83410,86110,I did install these shelves yesterday.
gCnJjWRf5dk,86110,87720,"- Okay, wonderful."
gCnJjWRf5dk,87720,89860,- Let's go check out what I actually got.
gCnJjWRf5dk,89860,91140,"- Let's do that, I..."
gCnJjWRf5dk,92800,95180,"- Sorry, before I give my boss a heart attack."
gCnJjWRf5dk,95180,96742,- She actually got me.
gCnJjWRf5dk,96742,97575,(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,97575,98930,"Sorry, I'm still reeling,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,98930,101300,it's not like it's technically against
gCnJjWRf5dk,101300,103120,any kind of established rules.
gCnJjWRf5dk,103120,104110,"- That's what I thought,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,104110,104943,I still got the CPU.
gCnJjWRf5dk,104943,106130,"- I bought a CPU,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,106130,107079,"I put it on a shelf,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,107080,108710,"and now, I'm gonna chug coffee..."
gCnJjWRf5dk,108710,109659,- Yes.
gCnJjWRf5dk,109660,111730,- For the next 10 months.
gCnJjWRf5dk,111730,114610,- I literally got everything I could possibly need
gCnJjWRf5dk,114610,117150,for the perfect graphic design/gaming
gCnJjWRf5dk,117150,118470,and streaming setup.
gCnJjWRf5dk,118470,119400,- That is sick.
gCnJjWRf5dk,119400,121020,- Yeah. - I'm already loving
gCnJjWRf5dk,121020,122240,some of these choices. - Right?
gCnJjWRf5dk,122240,125659,"- Like, so many people didn't think of stuff like this."
gCnJjWRf5dk,125660,127550,Where do I keep my laptop?
gCnJjWRf5dk,127550,129360,"- And when I need my Apple systems,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,129360,130860,I can just plug my computer in
gCnJjWRf5dk,130860,132480,or my laptop into my monitor
gCnJjWRf5dk,132480,134330,and ready to go.
gCnJjWRf5dk,134330,135740,"- The Peach Edition from Red Bull,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,135740,136980,"is this part of it, though?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,136980,138280,"- Yeah, it actually is. - Okay."
gCnJjWRf5dk,138280,141030,"- So I figured if I was gonna really be a gamer,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,141030,142270,"I need my energy drinks,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,142270,144990,so I invested some of my funds into that.
gCnJjWRf5dk,144990,146050,- I noticed.
gCnJjWRf5dk,146050,147410,You are one of the first
gCnJjWRf5dk,147410,150350,to go relatively modest in terms of GPU.
gCnJjWRf5dk,150350,151470,"So break it down for me,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,151470,153470,what's your intended mix here
gCnJjWRf5dk,153470,156620,for like graphic design versus gaming time
gCnJjWRf5dk,156620,158540,versus streaming time?
gCnJjWRf5dk,158540,159780,- So I just wanna make sure
gCnJjWRf5dk,159780,162010,"that I can get a good mix of all three,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,162010,164659,"my system doesn't need to be super overpowered,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,164660,166900,it just needs to be able to handle the Adobe
gCnJjWRf5dk,166900,168930,"and Creative Cloud programs,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,168930,170870,"but as well as like run Steam,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,170870,174634,run some games that I enjoy playing like Apex or Minecraft.
gCnJjWRf5dk,174634,175913,"- I think this will handle Minecraft, okay?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,175913,177736,"- Yeah, I think so too."
gCnJjWRf5dk,177736,178849,- Might be all right.
gCnJjWRf5dk,178850,180453,"Ooh, maybe not, actually."
gCnJjWRf5dk,181310,182390,I'm kidding.
gCnJjWRf5dk,182390,183290,- So what...
gCnJjWRf5dk,183290,184122,- I'm gonna have to try
gCnJjWRf5dk,184123,185610,and get her before this video is done.
gCnJjWRf5dk,185610,187853,We're gonna have a crap ton of cable management to do.
gCnJjWRf5dk,187853,190099,"- Yes. - If we're doing microphones,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,190100,193360,"like, studio monitors, laptop arm,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,193360,194260,we better get started.
gCnJjWRf5dk,194260,196786,"- Let's gather the computer. - Yeah, load me up."
gCnJjWRf5dk,196786,198065,"Oh, okay."
gCnJjWRf5dk,198065,199130,(Linus mimics)
gCnJjWRf5dk,199130,200480,I am passing the...
gCnJjWRf5dk,200480,201540,"No, I yap,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,201540,202540,"Whoa, that's a heavy motherboard."
gCnJjWRf5dk,202540,205750,"- Yes, so everything I got is new computer parts"
gCnJjWRf5dk,205750,207200,"except for the power supply,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,207200,208569,we are gonna use the old power supply
gCnJjWRf5dk,208570,210400,from my previous computer.
gCnJjWRf5dk,210400,212430,"- There's way more stuff here than I thought,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,212430,214109,are you sure you're within budget?
gCnJjWRf5dk,214110,214943,- I am.
gCnJjWRf5dk,214943,216023,- I didn't even see the chair. - I promise.
gCnJjWRf5dk,216023,217440,- I bet you didn't pay for this.
gCnJjWRf5dk,217440,219200,"- No, of course not,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,219200,221530,I designed it for goodness' sake.
gCnJjWRf5dk,221530,223940,"- Stolen from work, 100%,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,223940,226190,is this part of the Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade?
gCnJjWRf5dk,226190,227390,"- So this, I bought myself,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,227390,228350,but all of the paint
gCnJjWRf5dk,228350,231190,and art supplies are part of the upgrade.
gCnJjWRf5dk,231190,234230,"And as an artist, I really wanted to be able to put"
gCnJjWRf5dk,234230,235840,some of the money into buying
gCnJjWRf5dk,235840,237640,"some nicer art supplies for myself,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,237640,240210,"so I got a set of all new acrylic paints,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,240210,241670,"some new paint brushes,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,241670,244564,"some new sketchbooks, all of the fun stuff."
gCnJjWRf5dk,244564,246129,- Ooh.
gCnJjWRf5dk,246130,248020,"- And of course, how can we forget,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,248020,250440,the brand new LTT store cable ties.
gCnJjWRf5dk,250440,254680,"- That's right, now they are a 50 pack for the same price,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,254680,256299,and available in a bunch of different colors.
gCnJjWRf5dk,256299,258509,"- Yeah, I had to get the white to match my upgrade."
gCnJjWRf5dk,258510,260430,"- Buddy, that's not your chair."
gCnJjWRf5dk,260430,263520,"If you hang there, you are gonna get butted at some point."
gCnJjWRf5dk,263520,264759,"- Okay, let's get you all of the computer compartments."
gCnJjWRf5dk,264760,267249,"- All right, I'll stop getting distracted by the cat."
gCnJjWRf5dk,267249,268770,"Oh, my God, there's so much stuff here."
gCnJjWRf5dk,268770,270539,"- So I've got a new keyboard,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,270540,272670,"a new mouse, a Wacom tablet."
gCnJjWRf5dk,272670,276070,"I got some merch from my favorite film production company,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,276070,278510,"A24, because when you design merch,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,278510,280290,you also enjoy other people's merch.
gCnJjWRf5dk,280290,281890,- Right. (upbeat music)
gCnJjWRf5dk,281890,282723,- You got it?
gCnJjWRf5dk,282723,283556,"Oh, God."
gCnJjWRf5dk,283556,284389,"- No, I'm good."
gCnJjWRf5dk,284389,286663,"My nose is flat, I cannot see."
gCnJjWRf5dk,288085,289810,(box crumpling)
gCnJjWRf5dk,289810,291500,"- Originally, I wanted to build the computer,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,291500,294310,but I think that might take a lot longer
gCnJjWRf5dk,294310,296080,"than we want to, so..."
gCnJjWRf5dk,296080,298159,"- That's okay, we got all day."
gCnJjWRf5dk,298160,299850,"All right, Sarah's building a computer."
gCnJjWRf5dk,299850,300967,"- Okay, let's do it."
gCnJjWRf5dk,300967,303000,- New LTT screwdriver. Oh!
gCnJjWRf5dk,303000,304950,"- I think this is the intended use, right?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,304950,306360,For this new screwdriver?
gCnJjWRf5dk,306360,307340,"- Yeah, I think so."
gCnJjWRf5dk,307340,309610,"Can you tell there's a bit of rivalry between the like,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,309610,311080,fashion graphic design team
gCnJjWRf5dk,311080,312330,and the engineering team?
gCnJjWRf5dk,312330,315340,The way they treat each other's products? Shameful.
gCnJjWRf5dk,315340,316173,"- Oh, my gosh,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,316173,319270,he wants the thing hanging off of the light.
gCnJjWRf5dk,319270,322270,- I think I have a better chance of jumping into orbit.
gCnJjWRf5dk,322270,323660,"I'm not calling you cat fat,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,323660,324493,I'm just... - It's okay.
gCnJjWRf5dk,324493,325570,- Saying he's... - He's got a lot
gCnJjWRf5dk,325570,327240,of fur weighing him down.
gCnJjWRf5dk,327240,329000,"- Oh, yeah, it's fur for sure."
gCnJjWRf5dk,329000,331111,I'm thirsting for computers.
gCnJjWRf5dk,331111,332889,- So is Arlo. - Yeah.
gCnJjWRf5dk,332890,337890,"- So I know after being an experienced computer person,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,338450,340220,"I know you start with the motherboard,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,340220,343040,so I will get to opening that.
gCnJjWRf5dk,343040,343873,- Okay.
gCnJjWRf5dk,345340,346261,- Oh.
gCnJjWRf5dk,346261,347662,(kitchen cabinet slamming) - Tray.
gCnJjWRf5dk,347662,348495,"- Oh, smart."
gCnJjWRf5dk,348495,351229,- So I did get the Z690-A motherboard
gCnJjWRf5dk,351230,353570,to kind of match the black and white theme
gCnJjWRf5dk,353570,354710,that I'm going for.
gCnJjWRf5dk,354710,357151,One nice bonus that I don't have on my...
gCnJjWRf5dk,357152,358812,(Linus exclaiming)
gCnJjWRf5dk,358812,360794,- He just knocked it over.
gCnJjWRf5dk,360794,361627,(Linus laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,361627,362460,You do have...
gCnJjWRf5dk,362460,364960,"- Wow, it comes with a little key chain,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,364960,367660,"some stickers, this is the stuff that really matters,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,367660,369023,who cares about this?
gCnJjWRf5dk,369023,369856,(Sarah whistling)
gCnJjWRf5dk,369856,371259,That is a spiffy motherboard.
gCnJjWRf5dk,371260,373670,"- Some really good features on this motherboard, mkay?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,373670,376470,"We've got support for PCIe Gen 5,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,376470,379280,along with 12th Gen Intel Core processors.
gCnJjWRf5dk,379280,382610,"Got the nice little PCI Express release button here,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,382610,383469,"which is super cool,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,383470,385310,if you ever need to get your graphics card up.
gCnJjWRf5dk,385310,387160,"Got lots of power phases,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,387160,389160,this is a freaking sick motherboard.
gCnJjWRf5dk,389160,390860,"- There's the little triangle right there,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,390860,392729,"and see, I've got the little triangle here."
gCnJjWRf5dk,392730,394800,"- Mm-hmm, go ahead and stick it in."
gCnJjWRf5dk,394800,396280,"Oh, my God, you're shaking so much,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,396280,398090,"okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on."
gCnJjWRf5dk,398090,398923,- It's not...
gCnJjWRf5dk,398923,400320,"- No, no, that's not a triangle."
gCnJjWRf5dk,400320,402423,So the triangles here.
gCnJjWRf5dk,402423,403256,- Oh.
gCnJjWRf5dk,404100,405850,"- And also there. Okay, cool."
gCnJjWRf5dk,405850,407680,- So we gotta flip it the opposite direction?
gCnJjWRf5dk,407680,409340,"- This is actually a really good opportunity, though,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,409340,411900,for us to talk about the other way
gCnJjWRf5dk,411900,413400,"that you can landmark your CPU,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,413400,415259,because we'd really never mentioned it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,415260,416970,"So there's the triangle method, right?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,416970,418870,"Where you've got the little golden triangle in the corner,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,418870,420080,and you line that up with the triangle
gCnJjWRf5dk,420080,421470,that's either on the socket cover
gCnJjWRf5dk,421470,423510,"or silk screened onto the motherboard,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,423510,427620,"but Intel CPUs are also keyed, see that?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,427620,428453,You've got these - oh.
gCnJjWRf5dk,428453,430620,"- Little notches in the side of the chip,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,430620,432150,"and so, you can check that"
gCnJjWRf5dk,432150,435530,and you can validate them against the notches
gCnJjWRf5dk,435530,438170,that are also here in the socket to make sure
gCnJjWRf5dk,438170,439960,that you've got it in the right spot.
gCnJjWRf5dk,439960,440793,- All right.
gCnJjWRf5dk,441890,442885,I did it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,442885,443718,- Nice. - All right?
gCnJjWRf5dk,443718,445860,"And now, we close it."
gCnJjWRf5dk,445860,446882,- That's...
gCnJjWRf5dk,446882,447809,- Am I not supposed to do that?
gCnJjWRf5dk,447809,449270,"- Not how I would've closed it, but sure."
gCnJjWRf5dk,449270,451830,"- Maybe took me two tries, but I did it."
gCnJjWRf5dk,451830,453729,- You did it. What's next?
gCnJjWRf5dk,453730,455120,- RAM. - Yes.
gCnJjWRf5dk,455120,458210,- So I'm taking two RAM from my old computer.
gCnJjWRf5dk,458210,459470,- Okay. - And I'm also installing
gCnJjWRf5dk,459470,460600,two new RAM.
gCnJjWRf5dk,460600,462380,"Don't worry, I made sure that they're all the same,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,462380,464260,so we're not gonna have any issues there.
gCnJjWRf5dk,464260,465870,"- Two RAM for you, my lady."
gCnJjWRf5dk,465870,466703,- Thank you.
gCnJjWRf5dk,466703,467990,"After doing ""Secret Shopper,"""
gCnJjWRf5dk,467990,471430,I would say I'm pretty good at putting RAM sticks in.
gCnJjWRf5dk,471430,474793,"I know to look for the click, but I don't wanna jinx myself."
gCnJjWRf5dk,476260,478600,- A little pro tip for installing RAM on camera
gCnJjWRf5dk,478600,481010,is you wanna put populate from farthest away
gCnJjWRf5dk,481010,481944,from the camera operator.
gCnJjWRf5dk,481944,482777,- That makes sense.
gCnJjWRf5dk,482777,484250,"- It's okay, don't worry about it."
gCnJjWRf5dk,484250,486970,"- Arlo, pardon me, thank you."
gCnJjWRf5dk,486970,489560,"Next, I believe, is the SSD, correct?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,489560,491960,"- Correct, so you've got multiple options"
gCnJjWRf5dk,491960,493660,"in terms of your SSD install,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,493660,495780,"you have a really high performance SSD,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,495780,497600,"we've got a Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,497600,499500,"this is a Gen 4 SSD,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,499500,502300,"so while you could install it here, here,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,502300,504330,"or here... - Oh, it goes here."
gCnJjWRf5dk,504330,506793,- There's a total of four M.2 slots on this Mofo.
gCnJjWRf5dk,506794,508140,- Yeah.
gCnJjWRf5dk,508140,509130,"- You're gonna want this one, yeah."
gCnJjWRf5dk,509130,510310,- Awesome. - Exactly.
gCnJjWRf5dk,510310,513492,"- Okay, SSD. So this part goes in here."
gCnJjWRf5dk,514450,515440,(Sarah and Linus laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,515440,516331,- So what you're gonna wanna do
gCnJjWRf5dk,516331,517610,is you're gonna wanna turn this clockwise
gCnJjWRf5dk,517610,518539,to lock it into place.
gCnJjWRf5dk,518539,519373,"- Oh. - Yeah,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,519373,520919,it's a really cool little toolless mechanism
gCnJjWRf5dk,520919,521889,that ASUS has now.
gCnJjWRf5dk,521890,523180,"- Oh, I just have..."
gCnJjWRf5dk,523180,525339,"- Wow, what did you do?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,525340,527220,- I'm sorry. Can we like press...
gCnJjWRf5dk,527220,530399,"- No, stop, stop touching it."
gCnJjWRf5dk,530400,532050,Stop. (Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,532050,535180,- I have this AIO from EK.
gCnJjWRf5dk,535180,536210,"I was promised,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,536210,538340,"there was gonna be a 12th Gen bracket in here,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,538340,539730,"but it doesn't say that,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,539730,541050,"there's one on the box,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,541050,543620,so I actually am a little nervous
gCnJjWRf5dk,543620,545170,that that's not gonna happen.
gCnJjWRf5dk,545170,546490,"Matt, if you're watching this"
gCnJjWRf5dk,546490,549399,"and you're wrong, bad news."
gCnJjWRf5dk,549399,550440,(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,550440,551711,You're fired.
gCnJjWRf5dk,551711,553050,"- You don't have that power, Sarah."
gCnJjWRf5dk,553050,554993,- We're actually making really good progress so far.
gCnJjWRf5dk,554994,556297,- [David] Don't say that. You're gonna curse it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,556297,558330,- (grunting) Knock on fake wood.
gCnJjWRf5dk,558330,559520,Is it working?
gCnJjWRf5dk,559520,560843,"- I think so, yeah,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,560843,561700,"I think we're golden - Okay, that's good."
gCnJjWRf5dk,561700,563720,- But not because the correct mounting hardware
gCnJjWRf5dk,563720,566660,"was included, so you can let Matt know about that."
gCnJjWRf5dk,566660,568639,"- Yeah, Matt's fired. - Was not..."
gCnJjWRf5dk,568640,570361,"No, that's not what I said."
gCnJjWRf5dk,570361,571194,(both laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,571194,572350,Sheesh. - Sheesh.
gCnJjWRf5dk,572350,573750,- I'm just gonna move this.
gCnJjWRf5dk,573750,576800,"Woo. Yes, it has a built-in IO shield,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,576800,578350,"so we don't have to worry about putting the IO shield,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,578350,579678,you're good to put your motherboard in.
gCnJjWRf5dk,579679,580512,"- Okay, there we go."
gCnJjWRf5dk,580512,582377,"- Perfect, like a perceptional."
gCnJjWRf5dk,582377,583620,(hands clapping) - Beautiful.
gCnJjWRf5dk,583620,585093,- Our lo tired from helping.
gCnJjWRf5dk,585093,585926,- Yeah.(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,585926,586880,- It's a tough life.
gCnJjWRf5dk,586880,589111,"- Eat, sleep and poop. What a life?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,589111,590660,(paper crumpling)
gCnJjWRf5dk,590660,591493,Where's my scissors.
gCnJjWRf5dk,591493,592326,- Really?
gCnJjWRf5dk,594280,595370,Yeah. Totally easy.
gCnJjWRf5dk,595370,597339,- Yeah. The easiest.
gCnJjWRf5dk,597340,599890,- I do love to like tease Yvonne like that.
gCnJjWRf5dk,599890,602376,"Like if you can't open a jar or whatever, I'll like,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,602376,604430,"- It's just so here. - I'll totally go to my way,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,604430,607500,"to make it seem like as easy as possible to be like,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,607500,608490,yeah. Oh yeah.
gCnJjWRf5dk,608490,609589,"Oh, here you Gohan."
gCnJjWRf5dk,609590,610990,"Oh, wow. That's crazy."
gCnJjWRf5dk,610990,612250,It almost looks kind of cool.
gCnJjWRf5dk,612250,613083,"This like, - Oh, it's dust"
gCnJjWRf5dk,613083,614430,"- Pattern on here, but yeah,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,614430,616370,you've got a dust pattern on your powers play.
gCnJjWRf5dk,616370,619083,I often get like allergies when I'm cleaning.
gCnJjWRf5dk,619083,621230,"I think I have some kind of,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,621230,623771,"well, I tell my wife it's cuz I'm allergic to cleaning."
gCnJjWRf5dk,623771,625230,(Sarah laughing) That's good.
gCnJjWRf5dk,625230,627180,"Sorry, Hannah. I really wanna help, but just."
gCnJjWRf5dk,627180,628093,- Can't clean.
gCnJjWRf5dk,629120,631378,- Hold on a second. Is his food up there or something?
gCnJjWRf5dk,631378,633850,"- No, I have no idea why he's trying to get in there."
gCnJjWRf5dk,633850,637050,"- Your butt is so wide, but cat."
gCnJjWRf5dk,637050,639149,I think he has a wider but than me.
gCnJjWRf5dk,639150,639983,- Definitely - [David] It's close.
gCnJjWRf5dk,639983,640829,- Get over here Arlo.
gCnJjWRf5dk,640830,645830,"- Eddie, who I have this GM MK pro keyboard that I bought."
gCnJjWRf5dk,646000,648710,I really wanted to try assembling one on my own.
gCnJjWRf5dk,648710,650350,So I got all of the pieces here.
gCnJjWRf5dk,650350,652089,I decided to go with blue keys
gCnJjWRf5dk,652090,655510,because that's what I have in my keyboard that I use now.
gCnJjWRf5dk,655510,656660,There's more stickers.
gCnJjWRf5dk,656660,658550,I love when things come with stickers.
gCnJjWRf5dk,658550,660430,"If you buy from LTT store,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,660430,662574,your package will likely come with stickers.
gCnJjWRf5dk,662574,663800,- Designed by.
gCnJjWRf5dk,663800,664912,- Designed by ma.
gCnJjWRf5dk,665790,667990,"Now I've noticed this keyboard,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,667990,670770,like the base of a keyboard is really heavy.
gCnJjWRf5dk,670770,671603,- Oh wow! Yeah.
gCnJjWRf5dk,671603,673002,That's a machined base. - Yeah.
gCnJjWRf5dk,673002,674230,- How much has that keyboard?
gCnJjWRf5dk,674230,676660,"- I actually don't know, but it looks nice."
gCnJjWRf5dk,676660,677493,- Thanks Intel.
gCnJjWRf5dk,677493,679610,- I don't need this cable because I actually bought
gCnJjWRf5dk,679610,682000,like the iconic keyboard style cable.
gCnJjWRf5dk,682000,682900,How does this?
gCnJjWRf5dk,682900,686920,- So you just take this and line it up and give it a little.
gCnJjWRf5dk,686920,688660,- Okay. I've got a lot of these to do.
gCnJjWRf5dk,688660,690129,- Yeah. A hundred times.
gCnJjWRf5dk,690130,691484,What is he doing?
gCnJjWRf5dk,691484,693710,- It's just laying on his back.
gCnJjWRf5dk,693710,698710,"- Hi, I'm actually like,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,699380,701317,not far from finishing this machine.
gCnJjWRf5dk,701317,702400,- It's nice.
gCnJjWRf5dk,702400,704970,It's kind of been like a painless process so far.
gCnJjWRf5dk,704970,706839,"Other than that one. - Oh, why would you say that?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,706840,707693,Ah! Sorry.
gCnJjWRf5dk,708760,710120,Everything has gone so smoothly.
gCnJjWRf5dk,710120,711352,- You're still doing it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,711353,712960,- I'm sorry. - You're still doing it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,712960,714960,- All of my switches are in my keyboard
gCnJjWRf5dk,714960,719300,and I guess next I put the keys on for the key caps.
gCnJjWRf5dk,719300,720929,- Tediously put a hundred things on.
gCnJjWRf5dk,720929,721762,- Yeah. - Again.
gCnJjWRf5dk,721762,724050,- Oh! I have to do this in the right order too.
gCnJjWRf5dk,724050,725180,I didn't think about that.
gCnJjWRf5dk,725180,726390,"- I mean, you don't have to."
gCnJjWRf5dk,726390,728430,"- A, B, C no joking."
gCnJjWRf5dk,728430,730320,"- Oh, we're gonna need to mod this again."
gCnJjWRf5dk,730320,733570,"Basically there's magnets on the front piece,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,733570,736140,but you're supposed to hook these bad boys into the bottom.
gCnJjWRf5dk,736140,736973,- Okay.
gCnJjWRf5dk,736973,737970,- Because there's a radiator there.
gCnJjWRf5dk,737970,740339,"- Oh, - They can't go in."
gCnJjWRf5dk,740340,741920,So these need to come off.
gCnJjWRf5dk,741920,744529,"Do you have a pair of like needle, nose pliers or something?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,744530,749530,- We might have to like heat up a knife and cut them off.
gCnJjWRf5dk,750040,751380,"- I says, pardon."
gCnJjWRf5dk,751380,753860,- Well I couldn't find any pliers.
gCnJjWRf5dk,753860,757899,And I figure that may be the next best thing.
gCnJjWRf5dk,757900,760510,- I do wanna point out that we are not at work.
gCnJjWRf5dk,760510,761560,"So if anything bad happens,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,761560,764279,Sarah's in her own home doing her own thing.
gCnJjWRf5dk,764280,766310,- We got a little bit of brown on there.
gCnJjWRf5dk,766310,768100,I might paint it. I don't know.
gCnJjWRf5dk,768100,768933,- Did you wait?
gCnJjWRf5dk,768933,770040,Did you ever put the GPU in?
gCnJjWRf5dk,770040,771370,"- Oh no, I didn't. - Right."
gCnJjWRf5dk,771370,774410,- I got sidetracked by doing fun craft projects.
gCnJjWRf5dk,774410,776319,I always love holographic packaging.
gCnJjWRf5dk,776320,779450,Our new sticker packs actually have holographic stickers.
gCnJjWRf5dk,779450,782810,"- Okay, we we're getting very hung up on stickers today."
gCnJjWRf5dk,782810,784320,"- When we got this GPU,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,784320,789270,I didn't realize that the little stickers on top of the fans
gCnJjWRf5dk,789270,792061,are actually like a really weird yellow color.
gCnJjWRf5dk,792061,794379,(upbeat music)
gCnJjWRf5dk,794380,795859,- It's a big problem.
gCnJjWRf5dk,795859,797130,(Sarah sighing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,797130,797963,Hey.
gCnJjWRf5dk,797963,798796,- Is that in?
gCnJjWRf5dk,798796,801010,"- Yeah, Wow! There was almost no crunch."
gCnJjWRf5dk,801010,804180,- Wow! That is a beautiful computer.
gCnJjWRf5dk,804180,807410,- This is it. This is the moment it's loud.
gCnJjWRf5dk,807410,808339,- I love it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,808340,809470,- Are we ready to head upstairs
gCnJjWRf5dk,809470,810699,and try and post this machine?
gCnJjWRf5dk,810700,811681,"- Yeah, let's do it."
gCnJjWRf5dk,811681,812930,- I didn't want the silver or the black dial.
gCnJjWRf5dk,812930,813810,I'm not gonna lie.
gCnJjWRf5dk,813810,815520,I'm not really. - I think the silver.
gCnJjWRf5dk,815520,818423,"Yeah, I'm not feeling it either. It does not match."
gCnJjWRf5dk,818423,819894,"- Bye, bye buddy."
gCnJjWRf5dk,819894,821207,I'm stuck (Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,821207,822056,- Is it in there?
gCnJjWRf5dk,824170,825200,- I wasn't pretending.
gCnJjWRf5dk,825200,826910,I'll totally go to my way
gCnJjWRf5dk,826910,830009,"to make it seem like as easy as possible to be like,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,830010,830980,"yeah, oh yeah."
gCnJjWRf5dk,830980,832079,"Oh, here you go, Hann."
gCnJjWRf5dk,833170,834610,Holy crap. That is.
gCnJjWRf5dk,834610,835720,- We need David.
gCnJjWRf5dk,835720,837201,- What are you implying?
gCnJjWRf5dk,837202,838035,- I'm sorry.
gCnJjWRf5dk,838035,839569,- Here hold on. Let's get a shot of these arms.
gCnJjWRf5dk,839570,842400,- You can do it. - I don't it's course.
gCnJjWRf5dk,842400,843233,"- Well, Sarah,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,843233,844470,at least there will be a story behind
gCnJjWRf5dk,844470,846540,why your keyboard doesn't match.
gCnJjWRf5dk,846540,847693,- Yeah.
gCnJjWRf5dk,847693,848920,- [David] Nope. It's impossible.
gCnJjWRf5dk,848920,850560,"- Let's take this show upstairs, shall we?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,850560,851393,- Let's do it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,851393,852630,"- All right. Oh, side panel."
gCnJjWRf5dk,852630,854400,You know what? We'll put the side panel on there.
gCnJjWRf5dk,854400,859020,This Sarah is why you will never be allowed to design
gCnJjWRf5dk,859020,860230,a white mouse pad again.
gCnJjWRf5dk,860230,861550,- Never. I've already spilled on it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,861550,862860,Literally I'm not even joking
gCnJjWRf5dk,862860,865989,"within putting it down two minutes, spilled coffee on it."
gCnJjWRf5dk,865989,866822,(Linus laughs)
gCnJjWRf5dk,866822,869430,These I've borrowed from somebody and I have my own.
gCnJjWRf5dk,869430,871370,Now that we're gonna install.
gCnJjWRf5dk,871370,872680,- Got it. So this has to.
gCnJjWRf5dk,872680,873670,- Yes. - Got it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,873670,874550,- But. - Okay.
gCnJjWRf5dk,874550,878209,- I also have two monitor on that will also need to install.
gCnJjWRf5dk,878210,881520,- When show's gonna be late and you know whose fault it is.
gCnJjWRf5dk,881520,883140,- Worth it. Am I right?
gCnJjWRf5dk,883140,885097,- [David] Maybe for you yeah.
gCnJjWRf5dk,885097,886470,- Yeah. For you.
gCnJjWRf5dk,886470,888610,- I've never set up a monitor arm before
gCnJjWRf5dk,888610,891070,and I really have no idea what I'm doing.
gCnJjWRf5dk,891070,892490,"- Well, the first thing you're doing wrong"
gCnJjWRf5dk,892490,894649,"is mixing your parts in with mine, hold on."
gCnJjWRf5dk,894650,896920,- Uhoh - Thank you.
gCnJjWRf5dk,896920,899269,"By the way, Sarah, this is super cross threaded."
gCnJjWRf5dk,899270,901253,Those screws are never coming out.
gCnJjWRf5dk,902830,905740,"- Oops, I did get this monitor as part of my upgrade,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,905740,907510,but this one I owned previously.
gCnJjWRf5dk,907510,908343,- Cool.
gCnJjWRf5dk,908343,910370,- This is a Ben Q 32 inch
gCnJjWRf5dk,910370,912617,"like SRG, B calibrated design monitor."
gCnJjWRf5dk,912617,913450,- Cool.
gCnJjWRf5dk,913450,914820,- So this is what I use in like my day to day work.
gCnJjWRf5dk,914820,916042,- And this is.
gCnJjWRf5dk,916042,918600,- This is a gaming monitor so that I can game
gCnJjWRf5dk,918600,920529,and have it look nice.
gCnJjWRf5dk,920530,922070,- 2560 By 1440.
gCnJjWRf5dk,922070,926020,"- Yeah, so I have a tremendous number of things here"
gCnJjWRf5dk,926020,930240,"from my mouse to my Wacom tablet, to my Nanoleaf panels."
gCnJjWRf5dk,930240,933420,So I'm just start unboxing everything.
gCnJjWRf5dk,933420,935120,I don't even know where to start.
gCnJjWRf5dk,935120,936470,"Ideally for a stream set up,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,936470,938069,obviously you'd want a microphone.
gCnJjWRf5dk,938070,942560,So I did get the PSA1+ mic arm.
gCnJjWRf5dk,942560,943393,Wow!
gCnJjWRf5dk,944830,948460,- You have a lot of monitor lady.
gCnJjWRf5dk,948460,950890,- I didn't plan for the PC to be on my desk
gCnJjWRf5dk,950890,953160,so we can also move that down.
gCnJjWRf5dk,953160,956670,What I want to be able to do is have my laptop also on here.
gCnJjWRf5dk,956670,959899,"And if the PC is there, I also have speakers."
gCnJjWRf5dk,959900,964030,"So yeah, after lots of discussion with a few people"
gCnJjWRf5dk,964030,965010,"throughout the office,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,965010,968230,I was recommended this AUDIO-TECHNICA microphone.
gCnJjWRf5dk,968230,972269,I guess it's just really standard and good for stream.
gCnJjWRf5dk,972269,973102,So is.
gCnJjWRf5dk,973102,974617,- It there LTT 2020? - [David] It is.
gCnJjWRf5dk,974617,976110,"- Yep. - Yep, okay."
gCnJjWRf5dk,976110,977920,- Linus agrees. So that's a good sign.
gCnJjWRf5dk,977920,981050,Wow! It comes with a little pouch.
gCnJjWRf5dk,981050,982690,- You're impressed by the wrong stuff.
gCnJjWRf5dk,982690,984760,- Look at. It's so cute.
gCnJjWRf5dk,984760,986590,- So you're not even gonna spend any time
gCnJjWRf5dk,986590,989123,looking at like my beautiful cable management job.
gCnJjWRf5dk,990020,991150,"- I wish I could,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,991150,994320,but that wouldn't be a optimal for the setup
gCnJjWRf5dk,994320,995770,that I'm going for.
gCnJjWRf5dk,995770,996780,It is a shame.
gCnJjWRf5dk,996780,999307,- I just got dumped in the nicest possible way.
gCnJjWRf5dk,999307,1000140,(Sarah laughs)
gCnJjWRf5dk,1000140,1001830,So you just kind of move it till you're happy
gCnJjWRf5dk,1001830,1002680,with where it is.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1003570,1005589,"- Okay. I think there, oh wait,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1005589,1008209,"these should be like beside each other, right?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1008210,1010300,- So does it need to go over more now?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1010300,1011320,"- Nope, that seems fine."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1011320,1012710,- Are you very sure?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1012710,1013860,- I'm pretty certain.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1013860,1014740,- Okay.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1014740,1015573,- I like it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1015573,1016406,- All right. That's awesome.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1016406,1017821,Let's start getting things built up on here.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1017821,1018654,- Yay.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1018654,1020149,"- Oh, I wanna know if this computer turns on."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1020150,1021332,"- Oh, the button, but the one button."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1021332,1023459,- Okay. Do the honors.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1023460,1025470,Okay. I see blowing lights.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1025470,1026351,That's a good sign. - That's yes.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1026352,1027370,- That's enough RGB Sarah?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1027370,1028579,- Oh! Absolutely. - All right.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1028579,1030534,Especially 'cause you won't be looking at it ever.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1030535,1031368,(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,1031368,1035390,"32 gigs ram, 12,700 K, storage is detected."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1035390,1036620,All we need is a keyboard.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1036620,1039930,- I got this desk pad from Grove made.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1039930,1042579,"I'm sorry. I am a trader to ""LTT Store""."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1042579,1044429,But I really just wanted something simple.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1044430,1046880,- So what makes a Grove made special anyway?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1046880,1048113,- It's just black.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1049170,1052250,"Uhoh, maybe once we put the 10 pound keyboard on top,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1052250,1053320,it'll stay down.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1053320,1054659,Oh my Gosh!
gCnJjWRf5dk,1057254,1059037,It's beautiful.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1059037,1061059,Except for that. But everything else?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1061060,1063550,- I send you to get one thing and you not to have bring it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1063550,1065510,"- Oh, I need the mic arm. - Mouse."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1065510,1066800,- Oh no. That's on here.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1066800,1069480,"- Oh geez! Okay, great. Perfect."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1069480,1072400,- We were with the beautiful Pro Superlight from LOGITECH.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1072400,1074780,- That's not why you choose a Pro Superlight.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1074780,1075880,- Why? - Feel how light it is.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1075880,1077120,"- Oh, I don't really care about that."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1077120,1079535,It's white. That's what I bought it for.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1079535,1081400,"Wow! I've never felt mouse as light,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1081400,1083030,stark contrast from the keyboard.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1083030,1084023,"- It is pretty though, yes."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1084023,1084980,- That is beautiful.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1084980,1086140,- Confirmed pretty.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1086140,1088577,- I almost think it's prettier than the computer itself.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1088577,1090240,- [David] Whoa!
gCnJjWRf5dk,1090240,1091113,- I'm joking.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1092400,1094150,- Canto. What made you choose?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1094150,1094983,"Oh, like my God."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1094983,1096650,I know the answer. They're white.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1096650,1098055,- [both] Oh!
gCnJjWRf5dk,1098055,1101660,- Uhoh Arlo. One of those is not attached to the wall.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1101660,1103330,- Oh buddy.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1103330,1105643,- Yeah. The top corner on the right side.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1105644,1106477,- [all] Oh!
gCnJjWRf5dk,1106477,1107440,(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,1107440,1108970,"- Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1108970,1110690,Okay. I'm so sorry.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1110690,1112112,Come here. Come on.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1113120,1114040,- He's taking it with him.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1114040,1115810,"- Arlo, come here, okay."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1116680,1118770,"I'm sorry, down you get."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1118770,1121160,"- For streaming, the webcam that I was recommended"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1121160,1123380,was the C920s by LOGITECH.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1123380,1124940,So that's what I went with.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1124940,1127186,- Oh my God. The N key's not working.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1127187,1128020,(keyboard clicking )
gCnJjWRf5dk,1128020,1128853,- Huh?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1128853,1133770,"- Oh, it's back."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1133770,1134750,That's okay. I have an idea.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1134750,1138300,"- Okay. Oh, who needs a keyboard, right?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1138300,1141220,- Gaming stance. Show me your best gaming stance.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1141220,1142350,- I gotta scooch in a little.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1142350,1143445,- Okay. - All right. I'm gaming.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1143445,1145889,I'm gaming. - David.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1145890,1147250,- We need to show her how it's done I think.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1147250,1148690,"Okay, this is your gaming stance."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1148690,1150179,You gotta get in
gCnJjWRf5dk,1150180,1151640,- [David] This close to monitor.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1151640,1152501,"- No, I'm kidding."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1152501,1153334,(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,1153334,1154167,I'm kidding. You don't actually.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1154167,1156640,- You game like this with your most backwards.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1156640,1157520,- I'm that advanced.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1157520,1159200,Otherwise it's too easy.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1159200,1162600,- I am really into this game. Whatever I'm playing.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1162600,1163653,- Okay. So we're--
gCnJjWRf5dk,1163654,1165334,- And I'm talking because I'm streaming.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1165334,1166309,- you don't have to talk.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1166310,1168060,"Children should be seen, not heard."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1169246,1171250,- Do you break it wouldn't be the first time you broke
gCnJjWRf5dk,1171250,1174297,somebody doing one of these videos broke somebody.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1174297,1175326,(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,1175326,1176159,(metal creaks) - Something.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1176159,1177690,- [David] Andy's never been the same.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1177690,1178690,"- Yeah, of course,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1178690,1179919,"if you go with an XLR mic,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1179920,1182250,you're not gonna be able to just plug into a USB port
gCnJjWRf5dk,1182250,1183083,on your computer.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1183083,1184840,So I'm not actually familiar
gCnJjWRf5dk,1184840,1187760,with this particular brand of audio interface.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1187760,1190180,- It's white. It looks pretty and it matches.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1190180,1191870,- Those are all the same thing.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1191870,1193290,- And I've been told it's good.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1193290,1194800,"- Okay. Where do you want this bad boy,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1194800,1196413,you're not gonna have a ton of options
gCnJjWRf5dk,1196413,1197246,- There. That's good.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1197246,1198833,- This is a pretty short XLR cable. So--
gCnJjWRf5dk,1198833,1201183,"- Yeah, it's 6 inches, I think."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1203260,1205139,- Close enough. Yeah.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1205139,1206130,- [David] That's 6 inches?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1206130,1207760,- Sorry Six feet.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1207760,1209727,- Is this's what you think six inches is.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1209727,1210870,(Sarah laughing)
gCnJjWRf5dk,1210870,1214850,Wow.! Now is that suitably out of your way?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1214850,1215740,- Absolutely.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1215740,1216573,- Okay. - Yeah.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1216573,1218540,- So that's it. That's our little buddy.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1218540,1219760,"Okay, you know what? It doesn't matter."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1219760,1221360,"The point is there, it's there."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1221360,1223620,- I've had this computer for five years now
gCnJjWRf5dk,1223620,1225770,and the cable is starting to die.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1225770,1227810,"So as part of my upgrade,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1227810,1230121,"of course, I just got a couple of new cables."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1230121,1230954,- Right.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1230954,1232250,- And a new little block too.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1232250,1233870,- It really makes you wonder why apple tries
gCnJjWRf5dk,1233870,1235966,to make anything white when they can't keep it white
gCnJjWRf5dk,1235966,1237063,"for longer than-- - Like look at, disgusting."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1237063,1239660,"- I know, right? How much was this piece of nu?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1239660,1242110,- I think it was around $70.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1242110,1243179,- Because it's from Mac.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1243180,1244910,"- Yes. And I couldn't get white,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1244910,1247266,but the black still matches the black and white theme.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1247266,1248500,"- Oh, yeah. I think you're good."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1248500,1250180,- This is really coming together.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1250180,1252660,- That's sick. This is like a command station now.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1252660,1253760,- It is beautiful.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1253760,1255610,- This is an actual thing you can buy.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1255610,1257420,Does Google actually sell this?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1257420,1262420,"- Yes, I have been eyeing this for probably two years."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1262450,1263669,"Well, they actually came out"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1263670,1265030,"with one that doesn't glow in the dark,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1265030,1267000,but then they launched the dark mode one
gCnJjWRf5dk,1267000,1270090,"and I knew as soon as I found out I was getting an upgrade,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1270090,1271340,this is gonna be part of it.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1271340,1273250,It's the real life Dino game.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1273250,1275650,- It's pretty cute. I will give that to you.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1275650,1277920,"- I find it a lot easier doing work,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1277920,1280700,using a Wacom tablet instead of mouse and keyboards.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1280700,1283159,So I also picked one of these up for myself.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1283160,1285970,I guess it really does add to making the ideal
gCnJjWRf5dk,1285970,1288510,like graphic designer/gaming setup.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1288510,1290730,'Cause you can use it for a lot of different things.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1290730,1293169,- I can't say I've ever heard of A24. What do they do?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1293170,1295340,"- Well, they're a film production company."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1295340,1298350,They honestly have produced some of my favorite films
gCnJjWRf5dk,1298350,1300169,like Midsommar and Hereditary
gCnJjWRf5dk,1300170,1303533,and some award winners like Moonlight and Lady Bird.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1303533,1304366,- Cool.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1304366,1307309,- So I picked up these screen playbooks
gCnJjWRf5dk,1307310,1308640,because I already have some
gCnJjWRf5dk,1308640,1310297,and I wanted to complete my collection.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1310297,1311130,- Okay.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1311130,1314380,- How beautiful they are. Like as a graphic designer.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1314380,1317180,I love books that do a lot of like visual play
gCnJjWRf5dk,1317180,1319550,with typography and photography
gCnJjWRf5dk,1319550,1323200,and these like really tickle that like design funny bone.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1323200,1325639,"- Wow. What's this now, then?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1325640,1326960,- That's just a blanket.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1326960,1328220,- Oh it's the. - It's the ratios.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1328220,1329780,"- Yeah, it's the ratios."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1329780,1331950,"- Oh, that's fun and upside down here."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1331950,1333409,Let's get that fixed for you.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1333410,1335460,"- Look It. Oh, it's so cool."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1335460,1337610,- That is really cool. And then what are these?
gCnJjWRf5dk,1337610,1338813,- Those are t-shirts.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1338813,1339890,- Okay.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1339890,1342030,- Very simple logo design.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1342030,1342880,"- Oh, cool, okay."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1343920,1345100,- I also got a mug.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1345100,1346760,"I already have the hereditary, one of those"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1346760,1348280,and I wanted to pick up the Midsommar ones.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1348280,1350950,So I guess we'll put that.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1350950,1352480,"Oh no, I'll put it on top of here."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1352480,1354559,"- You got a bit of a thing for dinosaurs, hey."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1354560,1357550,"- I love dinosaurs. If you walk around my house,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1357550,1360170,we've got hidden dinosaurs everywhere.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1360170,1363610,"- You've got dinosaur faces, dinosaur ramps, dinosaur."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1363610,1366030,- So these pieces actually I commissioned
gCnJjWRf5dk,1366030,1367640,an artist from Saskatchewan.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1367640,1370690,He specifically draw like dinosaurs and stuff
gCnJjWRf5dk,1370690,1372710,"and I really loved his style, so yeah."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1372710,1374750,I commissioned three pieces from him
gCnJjWRf5dk,1374750,1376240,and I thought they would be a great addition
gCnJjWRf5dk,1376240,1377370,to my gaming room.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1377370,1380090,In order to make this kind of like a sanctuary for myself.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1380090,1383559,I bought a Diffuser because I really love essential oils
gCnJjWRf5dk,1383560,1386530,"and they help, kind of create an ambiance."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1386530,1387500,"And while I'm streaming,"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1387500,1389130,I definitely will get stressed out
gCnJjWRf5dk,1389130,1391000,and hopefully this will help.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1391000,1393770,- I am liking it. I could get comfortable here.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1393770,1394840,This is awesome.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1394840,1397244,We do need to figure out why the end key is not working.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1397244,1398240,(keyboard clicking)
gCnJjWRf5dk,1398240,1401200,"You know what, why don't we try a new key switch?"
gCnJjWRf5dk,1401200,1402549,'Cause like that's a thing.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1403490,1404760,Whoops! There it goes.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1404760,1406167,"Oh, you mushed it. Yep."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1406167,1407750,"- Oh, that's why."
gCnJjWRf5dk,1407750,1410810,- This is an amazing set up.
gCnJjWRf5dk,1410810,1413060,"- Right? I've got, got everything."
