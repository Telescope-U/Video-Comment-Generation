Tt_KT5NqUTo,139040,145120,and ko  watching  basically the three main fights on the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,145120,151280,card ben hannah justin hodges one of the  great fights all time paulo ocuso and uh  barrage
Tt_KT5NqUTo,151280,157920,and then liam wright and ruiz  liam wilson [ __ ] me dead we had trouble  with lambs liam's liam wright liam
Tt_KT5NqUTo,157920,165519,wilson jake wilson and there was no  right the surfer  the surfer owen wrote who's jake right
Tt_KT5NqUTo,165519,170799,jake wright not a circle or is that just  jake wilson liam right
Tt_KT5NqUTo,172800,178879,so you've got the the first name right  and the last name wrong i said jack  wilson so i got the last name right
Tt_KT5NqUTo,178879,184000,first name wrong and you've just  combined them yeah to make it doubly  wrong doubly wrong look and that was you
Tt_KT5NqUTo,184000,191200,know no disrespect to liam wilson a true  warrior he got the chockies without  the use of his left hand yeah i think he
Tt_KT5NqUTo,191200,196800,broke his hand earlier in the fight at  least that's what he said jake wilson a  friend of ours uh went to bathurst with
Tt_KT5NqUTo,196800,203280,him  every time i saw that last name it was  just bang jake came in my head and i  couldn't shake it had it it happened
Tt_KT5NqUTo,203280,208400,several times um i'm not apologizing for  it i'm merely pointing it out
Tt_KT5NqUTo,208400,214239,so we did that we commentated the boxing  uh the numbers are rolling in eddie as  we speak where we got our you know our
Tt_KT5NqUTo,214239,221120,people at no limit in ko um  saying that breaking records there was  about 400 000 people watching us which
Tt_KT5NqUTo,221120,227120,is that's conservatively  well like that they're just they're  their preliminary numbers tom um look
Tt_KT5NqUTo,227120,234400,you should see an uptick of 50 60 on  that number when it's all said and done  but we have broken records know that so
Tt_KT5NqUTo,234400,240720,thank you to the punter and the dribbler  for their support tuning in thanks for  tuning in uh first time we've done it
Tt_KT5NqUTo,240720,247439,don't think it'll be the last um  our bread and butter i think it's fair  to say is dribbling yarn i don't think
Tt_KT5NqUTo,247439,252720,i'm breaking any [ __ ] grounds  suggesting that  which ties in very nicely with rugby
Tt_KT5NqUTo,252720,258639,league biffs so like western star  spreadable but dribbling yarn that's  exactly so that's butter that you can
Tt_KT5NqUTo,258639,266880,spread pack  but dribbling yarn that's right the pack  so our focus moving forward will be
Tt_KT5NqUTo,266880,272160,rugby league beefs rugby league biffs  ufc biffs cause i think ufc we could  probably do a bit more
Tt_KT5NqUTo,272160,277759,i think moving forward it's biffs know  that but i think that we may have i
Tt_KT5NqUTo,277759,284720,think it's got like you know it's rugby  league biffs first and foremost and then  i think maybe like you know big ticket
Tt_KT5NqUTo,284720,292240,biffs  btbs  btbs you know the ones in narrative and  yarn and dribble and dribble so that
Tt_KT5NqUTo,292240,297440,would be that's that would be the goal  but uh yeah that was fun as [ __ ] look  packed house last night the brisbane
Tt_KT5NqUTo,297440,303360,convention center  well like  i mean brisbane convention is just a  beautiful convention center we flew out
Tt_KT5NqUTo,303360,309280,there private flew back private was  really nice um we're in bed by 12 am you  know what i mean yeah thus is the speed

Tt_KT5NqUTo,321199,326320,were and that's a place where people  convene for all manner of things well  it's a centre of convening yeah
Tt_KT5NqUTo,326320,331360,convention  i wonder what they do there i mean  obviously they did the biffs with their
Tt_KT5NqUTo,331360,336400,last night from it was great ringside  thanks to no limit thanks  but i'm saying like you know do they

Tt_KT5NqUTo,386560,393120,he bought the boot polish yeah which i  like to see  warmed my heart yeah  so we get into wardrobe last night
Tt_KT5NqUTo,393120,398560,punters and dribblers to get the lay of  the land well firstly it was pizzas in  the green room which was nice i'm now
Tt_KT5NqUTo,398560,404080,five from six days straight on pizza for  dinner which is ridiculous it's not  something i'm doing intentionally either
Tt_KT5NqUTo,404080,409360,friday saturday sunday tuesday  wednesday that's pretty [ __ ] out
Tt_KT5NqUTo,409360,414960,there  friday saturday sunday was all me in two  five from six is oh it's a lot it's a
Tt_KT5NqUTo,414960,422800,lot it's a lot if it makes it any better  i am intermittent fasting between the  hours of 8 30 and midday
Tt_KT5NqUTo,422800,428160,uh it probably doesn't because i also  sometimes love a vegan gummy and then at  like midnight i'm pounding [ __ ]
Tt_KT5NqUTo,428160,434560,salami and hummus so i mean it's not all  true but  the first three friday saturday sunday
Tt_KT5NqUTo,434560,440720,pizzas all on me tom's fault tom needs  to be better tom's a pig put your hand  up tom
Tt_KT5NqUTo,440720,445759,the tuesday pizza  was  going to my mum's house to dinner she
Tt_KT5NqUTo,445759,453120,was she's moving overseas  for six months and i went over there and  pizza was provided i had no option it
Tt_KT5NqUTo,453120,459199,was there was yeah okay  so i ate it yep how many slices did you  have not many
Tt_KT5NqUTo,459199,464319,because there was a fair few people  there and not a shitloader that  under-ordered
Tt_KT5NqUTo,464319,470400,well they had pizza and lasagna but the  lasagna i'm not gonna [ __ ] i'm looking  at you by reggio who i love
Tt_KT5NqUTo,470400,475919,but the lasagna was basically like  sloppy mints in a [ __ ] bowl  now that could be down to ubereats i'm
Tt_KT5NqUTo,475919,481280,not prepared to blame by reggia who i  hold in very high esteem and we spend a  lot of time there we have but the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,481280,487360,lasagna was  not up to card  [ __ ] there was no structural integrity  to it it was a pot it was a puddle
Tt_KT5NqUTo,487360,494000,undercooked  you couldn't get or potentially dropped  it wasn't undercooked because it tasted  delicious but the structural integrity
Tt_KT5NqUTo,494000,500160,was non-existent so you did try some  i had a bit of lasagna a bit of pizza  but i didn't have a lot of pizza because
Tt_KT5NqUTo,500160,506639,there wasn't a shitload to go around  sure we then wrote a wednesday  australia's boxing's night of nights
Tt_KT5NqUTo,506639,512159,we get into the green room before  getting a wardrobe and lo and behold  there's a [ __ ] one of the great prawn
Tt_KT5NqUTo,512159,518399,pizzas i've ever seen shout out to crust  and so i set about getting into it
Tt_KT5NqUTo,518399,524640,we did you made like work of it there  was four pizzas there for for three  hungry boys  i know it's the others in the room were
Tt_KT5NqUTo,524640,530800,were very gracious in allowing us  first riots to the pizza which that was  gracious i was like
Tt_KT5NqUTo,530800,537120,i was like these guys not eat well i  think they were just letting us lay our  claim yeah we put a hurting on them we
Tt_KT5NqUTo,537120,543279,put a hurting on them early  they needed to be hurt  but anyway so five out of six nights
Tt_KT5NqUTo,543279,548959,eating pizza is never going to be good  no matter who you are intermittent  fasting or not look at basically it sets
Tt_KT5NqUTo,548959,554320,you it sets you up  um i have done one 11 kilometer run in  between there as well just if that makes
Tt_KT5NqUTo,554320,559600,sense if that if that sweetens the deal  at all all i'm all i'm getting at puns  and dribbles is if you're attacking
Tt_KT5NqUTo,559600,568000,pizza five out of six nights it sets you  up poorly to try and  get yourself into it into a 36 pand
Tt_KT5NqUTo,568000,573600,when evidence suggests that you you're a  40. well now i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna
Tt_KT5NqUTo,573600,578720,pause you there  wardrobe asks for our dimensions because
Tt_KT5NqUTo,578720,584560,we're wearing the the black tie  bow tie  fur coats as you've seen
Tt_KT5NqUTo,584560,589600,suit shoes dinner shoes or the [ __ ] you  call  so
Tt_KT5NqUTo,589600,595279,i stand by  the truth and the reality that i am a 36
Tt_KT5NqUTo,595279,600480,in  everything  36 and under really i'm not over 36 at
Tt_KT5NqUTo,600480,607360,least i have been punished but know that  i have been i've been over 36 before  [ __ ] oath but i haven't been over 36
Tt_KT5NqUTo,607360,614079,in fact there are some 36 pants that i  literally turfed the other day and by  turf i mean donated because they were
Tt_KT5NqUTo,614079,622079,too big for [ __ ] this pizza love and  papa  but i get to the wardrobe
Tt_KT5NqUTo,622079,628800,at the brisbane convention center  and i go to put on  my dinner suit
Tt_KT5NqUTo,628800,634720,and  to say that they were smaller pants  would be one of the great
Tt_KT5NqUTo,634720,639839,understatements of all time well they  weren't small the pants they were small  on you
Tt_KT5NqUTo,639839,645120,that's not fair that's obviously do you  know that like i'm not you wouldn't you  would have cast that as a small pant
Tt_KT5NqUTo,645120,650160,well it's always got to be in the  context of the person wearing it right  like to a barbie doll they'd be the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,650160,657920,biggest pants of all time right  to a dog they'd be huge look they're not  a size small put that way they were 36
Tt_KT5NqUTo,657920,663040,right a 36.  now  that's cool
Tt_KT5NqUTo,663040,668640,but  they were  to get them done up punish dribblers  which i did initially i was like holy
Tt_KT5NqUTo,668640,674079,[ __ ] i'm not gonna be able to do these  [ __ ] pants this is  worst case scenario territory here pants
Tt_KT5NqUTo,674079,679200,don't do well after you after you ticked  off that mine were indeed 34 well  because i thought maybe they got it
Tt_KT5NqUTo,679200,684959,wrong so we're going to look at eddie's  and i'm like oh no okay so they're 34s  these i still defy anyone to prove like
Tt_KT5NqUTo,684959,691839,i don't believe they were 36s but that's  all right  i don't believe there are 36s i had to  pull them up above my child bearing hips
Tt_KT5NqUTo,691839,698160,and then basically above my belly button  just like where where there's the only  obstruction is organs you know so like
Tt_KT5NqUTo,698160,704480,you can you can mush organs you can't  mush hips no you can't well bone doesn't  work bone doesn't mush organs mush so i
Tt_KT5NqUTo,704480,709600,had to put it into organ territory and  mush me organs like i was wearing a  [ __ ]  what's the things that chicks used to
Tt_KT5NqUTo,709600,714639,wear like a girdle a corset girdle same  yeah think kate winslet titanic her
Tt_KT5NqUTo,714639,720800,mum's [ __ ] porn yeah yeah and it's  tight she can barely breathe she barely  breathes and her mum's being really  [ __ ] tea trudy
Tt_KT5NqUTo,720800,727519,yeah  you were gonna marry that cow whatever  um  he's a great fit for us he ensures our
Tt_KT5NqUTo,727519,732720,survival  um
Tt_KT5NqUTo,732720,738240,so i got him on  my testicles though were because i had
Tt_KT5NqUTo,738240,744800,to pull up so high to sort of organ  territory that's right and they weren't  exactly like a low
Tt_KT5NqUTo,744800,750800,they didn't have a low sort of gooch  part no no just conventional this was  this was like i might as well dropped an
Tt_KT5NqUTo,750800,755920,anvil on my sack like it was the poor  thing looked like  it was just
Tt_KT5NqUTo,755920,761279,you know if you like leave you know like  they leave flowers in books for a really  long time and you open them after all
Tt_KT5NqUTo,761279,766560,and they're just completely [ __ ]  pancaked yep that's what my [ __ ] dick  and balls look like at the end of this
Tt_KT5NqUTo,766560,772880,thing  just completely like oh that's beautiful  look at that there was and there was  concern on your face when you finally
Tt_KT5NqUTo,772880,779279,got the button up i don't know why you  insisted on putting on on buttoning up i  didn't well because there was i knew it
Tt_KT5NqUTo,779279,785279,was like we're [ __ ] we're in our gear  we're gonna get photos yeah yeah fair  enough but you looked at me like i'm
Tt_KT5NqUTo,785279,792160,gonna need that bigger jacket yeah  because you had the big black jacket  because i was like if i can have it  undone then i can have that jacket to
Tt_KT5NqUTo,792160,798399,cover it right you had the big fur so  i'm thinking i can get away with having  the pants undone if i have the bigger  fur i can cover the thing and you were
Tt_KT5NqUTo,798399,805200,like no and i was like what the [ __ ] is  this about where's the supportive  teammate here and you're like it's way
Tt_KT5NqUTo,805200,811760,funnier if your pants can't do up  tonight you piece of [ __ ]  which it was no it was because it was

Tt_KT5NqUTo,984399,989600,second round  and  they ended up getting the towel thrown
Tt_KT5NqUTo,989600,994800,in which was nice round two towel throw  they must have if if you're throwing the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,994800,1001120,towel in round two obviously he was  getting [ __ ] up which he was and i  think it's good that your corners like  throwing the towel but they must have
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1001120,1006959,expected very little from their fighter  if your towels were locked and ready i  think it's i think it's very i think it
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1006959,1012399,would i don't mean this with any  disrespect but i think even barrage  would agree that he was in the twilight
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1012399,1019360,of his career tom i'd say so 37 hasn't  had a rhyme he hasn't had a win since  2018. it's a long time now in fairness
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1019360,1025839,to him he did retire for three years he  had three he's often he's come back in  2021 and now he's fought against us
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1025839,1031600,look it was the tune-up of cuso needs on  on a path to  breaking jeff fenix record of seven
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1031600,1038319,fights to becoming world champion we'll  see  if he can accomplish listen it's a it's  a it's a [ __ ] it's a tall order it's
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1038319,1043520,a tall goal it's a large goal but you  know what that's that's what it's about  large goals
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1043520,1050720,large healthy tall strong goals  substantiative goals that's what it's  about setting goals
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1050720,1056080,achieving  now
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1056080,1061280,the fight of the night  was obviously ben hannah versus justin
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1061280,1067039,hodges  the people's main event a couple of  people's champions especially if you're
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1067039,1073120,a queenslander now i didn't know i knew  ben hadn't it was that he'd been  referred to as the polar bear over his
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1073120,1079360,career and the big omelet well no i knew  he was referred to as the polar bear  such is his polar bear
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1079360,1084559,appearance  big fat and white  but i didn't know
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1084559,1090960,about the omelet  and i believe from the notes we were  given it's purely based on his
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1090960,1096640,proclivity for consumption of omelettes  he absolutely adores omelets now the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1096640,1103200,math suggested to us tom and i crunch  the numbers quickly  he and his wife there's two plus the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1103200,1110240,eight kids makes ten now what's the  average egg per omelet it'd have to be  two two to three well i'd say
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1110240,1115919,four you think well but if you're a  child average across the children three  i think you got three average egg per
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1115919,1122799,day i think that if your name's the big  omelet then you're making at least 10  omelettes a day he'd be having a four to
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1122799,1128640,five egg minimum in his omelet i think  the wife would be three and all the kids  are three  so what's the average end four three
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1128640,1134640,eight's 24 plus the wife  is 27
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1134640,1141600,plus ben's five minimum you got 32 eggs  for one breakfast so 32 times 365 dior
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1141600,1146880,that's what we need  that's how many eggs that big boy is  putting away oh him and the family
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1146880,1153120,putting away a day  six hundred and eighty that sounds about  right yep that sounds about right that's
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1153120,1161520,a lot of eggs that's a lot of extra you  know divide that by 12 so we work out  how many dozen that is dave thank you  you'd have to buy the 36 packs uh 973 in
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1161520,1168160,a third so 974. 974 dozen  that's a that's a that's a that's a
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1168160,1173679,hannah's dozen  that's a hand it doesn't  that's a hannah dozen
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1173679,1179919,so the big omelette got in there he was  all on last night i got to tell you he  was awesome he looked like a [ __ ]  omelet he was all ominously he was
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1179919,1186880,bouncing and jiggling and he was  juggling and bobbling and it was a  jiggle off and you like to see that the  big boys the big leagues came to throw
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1186880,1193760,ben hannah got down from 116 to 106 or  something like that  he was all omelet coming into it 116's a
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1193760,1199919,big [ __ ] boy i don't know how him and  justin hodges are so close in weight  truthfully and now i know ben lost a
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1199919,1206080,bunch of omelette to get down justin  horages is a big frame bro  he's bigger than i realized i've never
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1206080,1212559,seen him in person so like obviously if  you're a big frame and then when you  blow out like  but i don't know it just sort of it just
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1212559,1217840,seemed like they were  closer than i would have ever expected  that being said
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1217840,1224400,jiggle it was jiggle we got and it was  it was good [ __ ]  ben
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1224400,1231120,listen i don't think either fighter  and our good friend the commission  george rose said as much to us when we
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1231120,1236240,spoke to him live from the brisbane  convention center last night uh ringside
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1236240,1243440,because the arm was like the winner  fights gallon and then once you saw the  fight you're like  i can't see a world where paul gallon
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1243440,1249679,doesn't kill both of these gentlemen in  a fight  that was what that that was that that  was the narrative in the yarn pre-fight
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1249679,1256799,thomas it may well have just been  designed to get some tongues a wagon  after the first 10 seconds of the fight
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1256799,1262640,i was you know instantly taken back to  other fights i'd seen hannah and hodges  have
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1262640,1268400,separately of course but  i didn't see a whole lot of improvement  and
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1268400,1274880,to suggest that they are on paul  garland's level is ridiculous in the  extreme could you imagine paul gallon as
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1274880,1280080,well he's probably like a send-off and  it's like yeah i'm probably one more  fight maybe and then
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1280080,1286000,seeing that fight and going  i just don't know if you can sell that  five well you can't because he would it
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1286000,1292400,would be a round one i would be  responsibly  emptying every bank account i have and  putting it on a round one
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1292400,1298080,i don't think you could get a market for  it he'd be doubt he'd be a dollar you'd  be an even your dollar neat i reckon  yeah
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1298080,1304159,maybe you get a dollar one unlikely i  just that's how one-sided that fight  would be it i just can't see it
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1304159,1310000,happening commish though admitted that  justin hodges who got the w probably  needs another fight if he's going to go
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1310000,1316880,on to fight gallantry i'd be shocked if  they ever fight i can't see that [ __ ]  happening  has fought for like heavyweight title of
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1316880,1322400,australia it just doesn't seem like you  can fight justice hoonie and justin  hodges
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1322400,1328720,and the last guy that [ __ ] gallon  fought was legit as well yeah krastevsky  could like
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1328720,1334080,no  i don't see that one paul garland is a  boxer paul gunn is a [ __ ] and
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1334080,1340240,also no jiggle on dat boy you know what  i mean like gal ain't jiggling no
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1340240,1345679,no he ain't well he's [ __ ] tough as  stone mate tough as stone that fight  would honestly be over in like 10
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1345679,1351679,seconds  uh but  it was fun to watch it was i would never
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1351679,1356720,know i will never ever ever ever ever  tire
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1356720,1360640,of watching leagues punch on no
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1366159,1371520,yeah the sweet science is is hardly  sweet sweet and sour science it's sweet
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1371520,1377760,and sour but like  are you expecting floyd mayweather no  surely you're not you want for the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1377760,1385679,jiggle you come for jiggle and haymakers  yeah yeah  i come here for haymakers
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1385679,1391919,that's what i'm here for and throw and  we asked him to throw in round two
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1394480,1400000,um  it's a great question well i don't know  no so
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1400000,1406400,the punch so so basically the punch of  haymaker big wide swing resembles uh you
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1406400,1411760,know like a scythe those things that  like the grim reaper yeah  so that's what they used to harvest hay
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1411760,1417200,with back in the day  you would come at a big wide angle and  kind of come from that just like a make
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1417200,1423840,height like a haymaker that makes sense  that makes sense  um  that is what you watch leagues for right
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1423840,1429120,not sleekness mainly well i think  post-career leagues it's jiggle
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1429120,1434960,hay makers and the sweet and sour  science  for current rugby league players
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1434960,1441279,muscularity hay makers  sweet and sour science that's right  if leggies are thrown it's the sweetness
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1441279,1446480,out of science yeah that's what we know  that is what we know to be true
Tt_KT5NqUTo,1447200,1455600,ah but a great night okay great night  thanks for tuning in thanks to no limit  for having us for ko for having us

Tt_KT5NqUTo,2152079,2159838,year using a sex toy his partner at a  restaurant frankly i'm shocked i didn't  think i could like him more than i  already did but here we are

Tt_KT5NqUTo,2195200,2202079,getting covered out of the ass and you  might be upset about it  but i don't see a huge problem with what
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2202079,2208000,i see as a great and effective piece of  marketing yeah  yeah dylan and his and his partner are
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2208000,2213839,the smartest ones in the room because  it's article after article now and  probably i would guess tom work piling
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2213839,2219200,up  well if i mean if it's especially if  it's their thing  if it's their thing they're selling i

Tt_KT5NqUTo,2250720,2256880,wash goes for longer time yes because  it's got to get the grease and the grime  off  so it's probably the perfect place well
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2256880,2262880,that is what you need you need to be a  sort of a sustained wash  if you are you know a bit of a
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2262880,2268480,germaphobe i mean listen  we are we talking sex toys back to back  episodes i think so is there is there a
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2268480,2274480,bit more info on the sex toys we talked  about sex toys last time uh i think we  were talking about fleshlights
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2274480,2280400,we were shout out to benji marshall um  do you want to dave you don't need to  because obviously you have to come away  from your desk there if you just want to
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2280400,2285680,or your seat you can go back to your  seat and speak into the mic and just  give us an update on the sex toy i'd be
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2285680,2292720,very interested to know  i'm assuming does this thing just sit on  top of
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2293359,2298960,you know certain areas the hot button or  is it like going inside
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2298960,2304960,deep within is this a is this just like  a sort of you know an external
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2304960,2310960,vibrator vibe or is this a like  you need to  pop this thing in
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2311040,2316079,um i mean i would assume that some of it  is going in otherwise you know but
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2316079,2322880,they're also feeling it from up top  so  i think if i'm happy if i'm gonna guess
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2322880,2328000,yeah  maybe it may even sit on the panty  linings on that's what i'm thinking and
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2328000,2333040,it's a bit of clitoral stimulation yeah  very doctory here
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2333040,2339200,look  if we can get dr phil on you well i  don't know about dr phil he's more of  like an emotional i think he'd cover
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2339200,2345599,this stuff maybe he would he covers  important issues tom sure what about is  there a doctor harry if i get dr harry
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2345599,2351760,on you  well  you know  i understand where you're coming from

Tt_KT5NqUTo,2491040,2497920,manly victory now  there's a lot of people out there that'd  be like what are you two [ __ ]  talking about but
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2497920,2503839,the way we played our rugby league  football against the cowboys a couple of  weeks ago
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2503839,2510000,was [ __ ] superb  except for the last seven minutes yep
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2510000,2515280,which i'm choosing  to forget for the point of this  conversation
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2515280,2522400,up until that point we looked red hot  we're back at brookie where we play our  best footy coming up against a monstrous
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2522400,2529119,storm site now paving housing back in as  it's gone off the screen dave i'm gonna  [ __ ] kill this tv in a second
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2529119,2535520,um  papi back in  that's cool  but you know what two weeks on the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2535520,2540640,sidelines or one week on the sidelines  with covert  i am
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2540640,2546079,i'm not liking his chances  i think he comes in a little underdone  yeah i think he's gonna be tired needs
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2546079,2551839,to be gassed  a couple of weeks out he's up against it  he's up against it mate was it an injury
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2551839,2557440,as well was it injury into covert i  think it was so is that a little ah yeah  it was yeah injury into covered like
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2557440,2562640,trell so  it could be a [ __ ] [ __ ]  performance for him and i think that
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2562640,2568480,stormed you are lost manly duel win  um  reuben at the back
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2568480,2574079,dce back  fuzz back  alakawatsu back
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2574079,2580720,to apollo 2 cooler back  shoes on the bench schuster on the bench
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2581359,2588480,like okay  the the the i think shoots is just not  uh this would be my
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2588480,2594160,perception of maybe where he's at is  that he's not [ __ ] fit enough or  maybe it's just that dez literally likes  his
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2594160,2600160,injection of  well he was starting in the back row he  was craig davey though
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2600160,2605280,of snapping people in half fame yeah  craig davey doing at the damn thing um
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2605280,2610880,on the edge  who knows who knows what that is  it's a weird one with schuster right
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2610880,2616319,he's obviously a big islander boy  and  it's like some people like you know he
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2616319,2623839,doesn't look like he's fit enough and  i'm like but there are some players that  just don't get fit  don't look [ __ ] jacked but they could
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2623839,2629040,still be fit and good  yeah like there's some that carry maybe  a little bit of puppy fat so to speak
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2629040,2636079,yes but that's just always there it's  part of like to maintain a certain  weight there needs to be a little bit on
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2636079,2643359,them you know what i mean as opposed to  like [ __ ] really trimming down and  getting down to like 80 kilos just like  no no no i play better footy when i'm 95
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2643359,2649680,100.  so let me bulk so let me bulk  so let me bulk i
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2649680,2655359,i honestly truthfully think that mainly  get the chocolates tonight yeah i'm not  coming in here talking [ __ ] i think
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2655359,2662160,there's something in the air  there's something  doing the rounds  from a vibe based perspective that's
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2662160,2669040,making me feel really confident about  tonight really confident yep like i put  a wager on confident yeah
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2669040,2675839,i will put away drone only 13 plus  reuben anytime  love it 15 bucks i think are you worried

Tt_KT5NqUTo,2688640,2694160,pretty sure that our bench takes a  steamy piss i will say that alloy out  concerns me
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2694160,2699359,is he who's starting in the front row  simply is it uh front row is keppy and  sipley
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2699359,2705280,interesting  can you see the bench there uh yes dylan  walker jaden nicorema no competition

Tt_KT5NqUTo,2711280,2717440,nelson martin to power thinks he's big  he is like me compared to i'm saying  nelson is fine i'm happy with nelson
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2717440,2723599,over martin paseka over jordan grant  like wake the [ __ ] up and it's gone  again my god it's [ __ ] tv
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2723599,2728880,um we got a big bench which i'm happy i  like seeing toy and nelson on there  that's a scary bench that's a bench you
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2728880,2734079,don't want to walk into in a dark alley  well luckily it's not a dark alley  luckily it's a [ __ ] professor it's a
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2734079,2741200,well-lit book failover well lit  brookville the principal still stands i  believe we  that bench is [ __ ] for melbourne um and
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2741200,2747200,then go back up through the team jakey  jake and uh brandon smith lock jake
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2747200,2753040,better than brandon noticed spec brandon  uh davey better than kenny kenny  brummich comfortably ola kawa too better
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2753040,2758400,than chris lewis of  i wouldn't pick chrysalis if i bumped  into him i wouldn't know who it is
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2758400,2764079,no disrespect history teacher chris  lewis he knows the history of the game  simply better than josh king lachlan
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2764079,2769920,croaker easily better than harry graham  yeah i'll give you that one i can't i  can't argue with that keppy better than
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2769920,2775200,jesse bromwich  daley better than jerome kieran better  than meanie
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2775200,2781599,to upload two better than grant would he  be the only player in the nrl called  grant  have to be
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2781599,2787760,have to be is there another an aerial  player called grant i don't think so  there's grant atkins well there's harry
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2787760,2792960,grant and there's jordan grant that's no  not what we said though  i'm aware of her name we're talking
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2792960,2798640,about his name's on anderson grand is it  it's grant anderson  and i think it's a great point you make
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2798640,2805599,tom a great point you make you don't see  a whole lot of grants running around  playing you don't see grants dude you  don't see grants grant to me even though
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2805599,2811680,it is a first name i think it's more of  a last name that's been converted to a  first name or you know like i got a
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2811680,2817119,grant from the government a government  grant yeah government grant you know  they're the only kind of grants i
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2817119,2824240,usually get around last grants and  grants from the government yeah  or like grant access to something
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2824240,2829760,can you grant me access yeah sure  grant is a first name we'll throw you
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2829760,2834800,know  throw a lot of people off i think it's a  it's a curveball
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2834800,2840880,i don't like i i think that unbalances  the size i think it definitely does i  think it's a concern for melbourne
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2840880,2846720,because no one will know if they're  talking about harry grant  someone anderson
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2846720,2852880,grant anderson harry grant  hugh grant  is he best to go with mr anderson
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2852880,2859920,well i mean it's i think it is probably  because at least then then he but then  he invites the matrix comparison that's
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2859920,2865040,right  that's right look also eddie look at  this photo compared to everyone else
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2865040,2870640,very alarming  very alarming that photo has been taken  like just some in the middle of nowhere
Tt_KT5NqUTo,2870640,2875839,it makes him look like a very small man  yes  like an ant yes

Tt_KT5NqUTo,3123520,3128880,yeah it is  that is ungodly short yep but the  roosters aren't performing it's as
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3128880,3135040,simple as that i know that we're all  waiting for him to turn this magical  corner  turn this magical corner that no one
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3135040,3141200,knows where the [ __ ] is and they haven't  turned no nothing's turned  turnless
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3141200,3147200,can't turn can't turn can't turn left  sharks are gonna pump the dogs you don't  agree with that i don't agree with that
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3147200,3152559,no i don't  again thomas you think the dog's gonna  win i think the dog's gonna win no no
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3152559,3159280,mick potter i don't know if that means  much it doesn't matter he's not gonna be  at the game he's got covered i don't  think that means much i'm not like if
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3159280,3164800,you said no matt burton i'd go okay  okay sure  that's that's an interesting [ __ ]
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3164800,3171520,development no respect for mick okay uh  cowboys broncos i like broncos i don't  know why i just do
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3171520,3178720,oh  the cows like the cows almost losing to  manly to me was like okay but mainly a  [ __ ] red hot no i know but that's why
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3178720,3184079,i'm saying the broncos could  a bit of the broncos red hot they're  pretty good dude they didn't look bad
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3184079,3191760,against the storm considering it was the  storm  yeah they looked okay against the storm  now that being said i'd been on the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3191760,3197760,marks all day and i don't really  remember and you and i were sort of  bringing it home  we were whipping at home
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3197760,3204480,at your new residence and paying partial  attention to the game but the scoreline  suggested and others right look we were
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3204480,3210640,weeping at home yeah that's true we were  in the final six hundred and yeah we're  whipping it home so i don't know we we'd
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3210640,3215920,peeled and were we peeled and worked it  was hands and heels hands and heels yeah  we pulled up getting into our work yep
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3215920,3221520,we were working we were working put it  that way so  i don't know but i
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3221520,3228319,want the broncos to win i want the  cowboys to win i don't like the broncos  i don't like the broncos either to be  honest i don't all i want is selling
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3228319,3233440,cobbler to score two tries that's all i  want  right okay
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3233440,3240559,that makes sense yep now rabbit ozils i  hate both these sides but i  hate the rabbitohs less but i think the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3240559,3246480,eels win  like the fact that the rabbit owes a  seventh in the yields are sixth i'm like  the rabbitohs are so much worse than
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3246480,3252800,seventh in my opinion  yeah they're [ __ ]  they are they're no good the eels i
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3252800,3258559,think get the chockies but latrell back  for the bunny the troll back honestly it  wouldn't shock me if the rabbits won
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3258559,3264160,like the eels are [ __ ] hot and cold i  would love them to win because i hate  the eels let's not pretend like the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3264160,3271119,yields roll out great footy week in week  out they've got a loss in them  they get a loss in it mate loss to the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3271119,3276240,tigers lost to the dogs  is that the math  yeah
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3276240,3281920,is that the math i think that's the math  now warriors west tigers you don't think  that the wires are going to get up in
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3281920,3288799,front of their own people i don't back  home and you're using are you using the  i'm not using the tigers like thing as
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3288799,3295760,like well that's why it won't happen i'm  saying fairy tales don't happen the  warriors suck  fairy tales do happen they do and they
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3295760,3302240,don't of course they don't but they do  yeah they do i don't think the warriors  have shown  enough for me to think they get up in
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3302240,3308960,fact i think they've shown me enough to  think that this is a sort of game they  get [ __ ] flogged in  i saw some stat that was like there's
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3308960,3315599,only two people in the warriors 17 who  were at the or who were in the last  warrior side that played in new zealand
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3315599,3322480,yeah so they probably didn't even  [ __ ] feel it as much yeah they were  like there's like a bunch of the players  on their team who've never played a  first grade game in new zealand so it's
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3322480,3328000,not like it's um  it doesn't necessarily mean as much to  those players
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3328000,3333520,again who the [ __ ] knows  does this thing overwhelm them as a team  that already can't handle pressure who
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3333520,3339280,can't score a point when they've got  [ __ ] a two-man advantage in a game  and now it's like back in new zealand we
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3339280,3345040,have to win this one the pressure the  pressure our tigers are like we suck  dude we [ __ ] got no pressure at all
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3345040,3349318,we're just gonna go over there and try  and play
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3351280,3356240,i see it being [ __ ] 13 plus to the  tigers
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3356640,3362480,i disagree i've got to go with the  warriors on this one punters and  dribblers ayataroa you know back to
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3362480,3368000,auckland bantam back to mount smart  stadium in front of their own people  after three years i think they lift tom
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3368000,3373200,i think they lift and the west tigers  suck  so much
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3373200,3380079,they do they suck they both look both  these teams suck so no result is off the  table like you can have a massive wind
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3380079,3385520,of the warriors a small wind of the  warriors a massive wind of the tigers a  small end of the tigers or a draw or the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3385520,3391680,game just being called off because it's  so [ __ ] like there is no option that is  off the table do you think that there's
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3391680,3397680,a chance they call the game off  i mean if you have like nil  at half time
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3397680,3403200,no one's even had an attacking set  no completions  there's a very good chance peter just
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3403200,3409040,goes kill it  so at half time no one's completed a set  you just go [ __ ] pull the plug
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3409040,3415119,pull the plug every player's missed  three tackles each yeah pull the plug  now  and there's 19 unforced arrows per
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3415119,3420400,player kill it just kill it kill it look  i can i mean under those circumstances
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3420400,3425760,in in that sort of environment i think  that there's a chance it gets killed but  we'll have to wait and see dragons
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3425760,3433440,raiders around it out  i'm on the raiders here baby i  how are the dragons still eighth
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3433440,3438960,how are the dragons still eight yeah i  mean it's because we lost to the cowboys  that's why yeah let's look at the ladder
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3438960,3444079,here uh what are we here points 14  uh so we've got the roosters what's our
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3444079,3449760,four and against  324  no minus four i was gonna say that's
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3449760,3455200,correct  um  so we need to win who are the dragons  playing raiders so i want we want the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3455200,3460960,raiders to win  we want the dra and we want panthers to  win and then we need manly to beat the
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3460960,3468000,storm now is that likely we want not  well actually if the raiders win they  jump up no they don't they're minus 39  we want raiders to win
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3468000,3475200,so that we can jump the dragons but then  we want the raiders to keep losing  so that our bets listen cycle pride and
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3475200,3480880,maintain manly need a win that's first  and foremost the dragons need a small
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3480880,3486400,win so that we all jump  does that make sense and then it's going
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3486400,3493359,to be roosters if dragons and manly win  sorry if manly and raiders win
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3493359,3498880,and the panthers win  yep roosters could go down to 11th
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3498880,3504640,they would go down 12th they'd go down  to 11th  if bunnies lose as well you can overtake
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3504640,3510880,them if they lose a new win by about 10  each  so we could be into seventh
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3510880,3516799,it's fairly congested around the seven  eight nine 10 11. they're making up  numbers
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3516799,3522880,not manly wearing a slipstream to the  top but in the all those other [ __ ]  teams making up numbers like
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3522880,3531119,bro panther's already on 28 points [ __ ]  me dead  you've only lost one game
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3531119,3537440,[ __ ] impressive yeah what's that  which one's manly got the buy next  weekend as well that'd be good let's go
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3537440,3544960,into the bus get a win and then go into  the buy  a win  into the end of the buy
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3546799,3552960,can you just go to manly's upcoming  games please because i know there's a  penrith one in there as well
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3552960,3558960,but again i think we win that  i think we win that one well  why do you reckon you get two points for
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3558960,3564000,the buyer  uh because  as opposed to just giving no one points
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3564000,3571040,yeah cause you haven't won a game  don't know it's off the screen again  dior uh okay knights is it
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3571040,3577760,so buy it then knights  yeah yep  is it not moving no
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3577760,3585680,then dragons is the next one  okay that's all right dude if we go  so if we win the storm
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3598559,3601200,two points
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3605280,3611359,we could go undefeated for the rest of  the season  it all starts tonight yeah it starts  tonight against the storm if we can get
Tt_KT5NqUTo,3611359,3617599,over that hump if we can get over that  hill we it's literally downhill to the  finals and we can come in with like
