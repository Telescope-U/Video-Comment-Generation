RGFepU7VXcY,380,1213,- Hello everyone.
RGFepU7VXcY,1213,4566,"So today I'm going to offend you, fun."
RGFepU7VXcY,4566,6609,"No, I'm going to share fashion mistakes"
RGFepU7VXcY,6610,7630,that I think are just aging you.
RGFepU7VXcY,7630,9110,"It's making you look way older than you are,"
RGFepU7VXcY,9110,11379,"and I'm sure you know, well"
RGFepU7VXcY,11380,12480,I don't really do any of this stuff.
RGFepU7VXcY,12480,13809,I'm not saying I look super young.
RGFepU7VXcY,13810,16440,I am in my thirties and I don't know.
RGFepU7VXcY,16440,17540,Maybe I look way older than that
RGFepU7VXcY,17540,20750,but these are specific things that I see everywhere
RGFepU7VXcY,20750,24780,and I swear it makes you look way older in a bad way.
RGFepU7VXcY,24780,27060,So I'll be very specific in this video.
RGFepU7VXcY,27060,28590,If you have some of these items
RGFepU7VXcY,28590,30600,and you think it's just super flattering on you
RGFepU7VXcY,30600,31860,then you keep wearing it
RGFepU7VXcY,31860,32870,but this is just my opinion.
RGFepU7VXcY,32870,34440,"So I will be sharing,"
RGFepU7VXcY,34440,35989,the bad fashion mistakes that I see
RGFepU7VXcY,35990,37420,and then ways to improve it.
RGFepU7VXcY,37420,38809,So let's just get started with the first one
RGFepU7VXcY,38810,40150,that everyone always talks about.
RGFepU7VXcY,40150,42470,"This is nothing new, but I definitely agree with it"
RGFepU7VXcY,42470,43970,and it's Capri pants.
RGFepU7VXcY,43970,45210,And here's what I'm talking about
RGFepU7VXcY,45210,47899,which I'm sure you're all very well aware of Capri pants.
RGFepU7VXcY,47900,49620,"You might have some, you might still wear them."
RGFepU7VXcY,49620,52230,"I mean, heck you can still buy Capri pants"
RGFepU7VXcY,52230,54230,but I don't think they're ideal for a couple reasons.
RGFepU7VXcY,54230,56290,"Number one, they are out of style."
RGFepU7VXcY,56290,57770,They're absolutely out of style.
RGFepU7VXcY,57770,60680,"Number two, they are very, very unflattering."
RGFepU7VXcY,60680,63400,They actually cut your leg off at the worst spot.
RGFepU7VXcY,63400,66230,"It cuts your leg off right at the center of your calf,"
RGFepU7VXcY,66230,67290,which is that muscle
RGFepU7VXcY,67290,70280,and it makes your legs look way chunkier
RGFepU7VXcY,70280,72520,and way stumpier than they really are.
RGFepU7VXcY,72520,75930,And because of the bizarre length of the Capri pants
RGFepU7VXcY,75930,79230,"it actually tricks our eyes into thinking, you know"
RGFepU7VXcY,79230,81170,like when you're looking at somebody wearing Capri pants
RGFepU7VXcY,81170,83320,it makes it look like they torso
RGFepU7VXcY,83320,87070,"is the same length as their legs, which is really bad."
RGFepU7VXcY,87070,89330,We want to have long looking legs.
RGFepU7VXcY,89330,90340,That's what makes us look younger
RGFepU7VXcY,90340,92670,when we have like longer leaner legs.
RGFepU7VXcY,92670,95600,So the Capri pants completely wipes that out
RGFepU7VXcY,95600,97909,and I know Capri pants are technically kind of
RGFepU7VXcY,97910,101600,"a warmer weather style, you know, in the summer,"
RGFepU7VXcY,101600,103100,"kinda like it let's air flow in,"
RGFepU7VXcY,103100,105220,"but they're not really like it, they're still pants."
RGFepU7VXcY,105220,109840,So I would say to kind of look younger and fresher just
RGFepU7VXcY,109840,111990,you can still wear maybe ankle pants.
RGFepU7VXcY,111990,114310,"It's gonna give you the same effect, but again"
RGFepU7VXcY,114310,116810,it cuts you off on the smaller portion of your leg
RGFepU7VXcY,116810,118360,and way more flattering.
RGFepU7VXcY,118360,121640,"Bermuda shorts, I'll cut to the chase, short and sweet"
RGFepU7VXcY,121640,122473,very similar to Capri pants.
RGFepU7VXcY,122473,124570,They're just a bizarre length.
RGFepU7VXcY,124570,127200,I didn't love them when they were in-style
RGFepU7VXcY,127200,129099,but they're absolutely out of style now
RGFepU7VXcY,129100,130250,but I still see them around
RGFepU7VXcY,130250,132920,"and I kind of understand why, like I know they're shorts,"
RGFepU7VXcY,132920,135770,"that they conceal a larger portion of your legs,"
RGFepU7VXcY,135770,137120,so if you don't love your legs
RGFepU7VXcY,137120,138340,you feel more comfortable in them
RGFepU7VXcY,138340,140610,and it's great for the hotter temperatures
RGFepU7VXcY,140610,142240,but I'm not saying you need to wear
RGFepU7VXcY,142240,144480,Jessica Simpson cutoff shorts and show how off your butt.
RGFepU7VXcY,144480,149239,"No, all I'm saying is the Bermuda shorts are out of style,"
RGFepU7VXcY,149240,152760,"aging, it's not flattering, it cuts your leg off 50 50."
RGFepU7VXcY,152760,154720,I just think wearing a normal pair of shorts
RGFepU7VXcY,154720,156210,maybe a little bit above your knee
RGFepU7VXcY,156210,158250,would instantly make you look younger.
RGFepU7VXcY,158250,160480,Next we have bulky shoes
RGFepU7VXcY,160480,163209,"and I am well aware, like I'm still in my thirties."
RGFepU7VXcY,163210,167410,I feel like this is going to be not well received.
RGFepU7VXcY,167410,168820,Like this is not gonna be a video
RGFepU7VXcY,168820,169720,where people are happy with me
RGFepU7VXcY,169720,171850,because I know that I'm not in my forties
RGFepU7VXcY,171850,173640,or fifties or sixties and up
RGFepU7VXcY,173640,176640,where I have problem feet
RGFepU7VXcY,176640,179480,and I have to wear bulky shoes
RGFepU7VXcY,179480,181920,because the regular stilettos don't work for me.
RGFepU7VXcY,181920,182870,Like I understand.
RGFepU7VXcY,182870,185349,"However, my whole point in this is,"
RGFepU7VXcY,185350,188520,I think a lot of people are still kind of stuck
RGFepU7VXcY,188520,190770,in wearing bulky shoes
RGFepU7VXcY,190770,192490,because their feet aren't good anymore
RGFepU7VXcY,192490,195260,"and they need comfort over style, which I understand."
RGFepU7VXcY,195260,197900,"But my point is, there's a lot of brands these days,"
RGFepU7VXcY,197900,199530,"even in the last five years alone,"
RGFepU7VXcY,199530,204280,have come miles with like really stylish shoes
RGFepU7VXcY,204280,205870,that are also comfortable.
RGFepU7VXcY,205870,208780,So I would say Clarks is like one of the best brands.
RGFepU7VXcY,208780,211970,They have so many stylish shoes right now
RGFepU7VXcY,211970,214520,"that are very, very comfortable."
RGFepU7VXcY,214520,216000,"And they're like, they're wider"
RGFepU7VXcY,216000,217590,so that you don't feel really constricted
RGFepU7VXcY,217590,218620,"and don't get me wrong,"
RGFepU7VXcY,218620,221010,there's a lot of ugly shoes on their website too
RGFepU7VXcY,221010,222819,but there are so many stylish shoes too.
RGFepU7VXcY,222820,226250,"So, if you have really, really, really bad feet"
RGFepU7VXcY,226250,228740,and you think you're wearing really bulky shoes
RGFepU7VXcY,228740,230950,"just shop around, you'd be surprised"
RGFepU7VXcY,230950,232440,at how stylish you can be.
RGFepU7VXcY,232440,235400,"Okay. So this next style, it's multiple styles"
RGFepU7VXcY,235400,237010,that are definitely aging you
RGFepU7VXcY,237010,240090,is anything that is meant to be juvenile
RGFepU7VXcY,240090,242840,like very little girl styles.
RGFepU7VXcY,242840,245890,And I know that I'm not really explaining myself well here
RGFepU7VXcY,245890,246850,and I wanna be clear.
RGFepU7VXcY,246850,248370,I'm not talking about styles
RGFepU7VXcY,248370,249980,that you see younger people wearing
RGFepU7VXcY,249980,252129,"and you're like, oh my gosh, I could never pull that off,"
RGFepU7VXcY,252130,255150,"it's too trendy for me, I just don't look good in that."
RGFepU7VXcY,255150,255982,I don't mean that.
RGFepU7VXcY,255983,257010,I'm talking about styles
RGFepU7VXcY,257010,258769,that are literally meant for little girls
RGFepU7VXcY,258769,261349,"and an example of this would be Mary Janes,"
RGFepU7VXcY,261350,262913,like those shoes.
RGFepU7VXcY,262913,264190,I see women wearing them
RGFepU7VXcY,264190,266650,"because they're again kind of like bulky and comfortable,"
RGFepU7VXcY,266650,267830,but they're still young.
RGFepU7VXcY,267830,270169,"No, they're meant for like five year olds."
RGFepU7VXcY,270170,271740,And same with like berets in the hair.
RGFepU7VXcY,271740,272930,"If you're wearing berets in your hair,"
RGFepU7VXcY,272930,274460,it's meant for little girls.
RGFepU7VXcY,274460,275729,"Same with little cardigans,"
RGFepU7VXcY,275730,277430,like little cardigans over dresses.
RGFepU7VXcY,277430,278699,That's actually my next point.
RGFepU7VXcY,278700,282560,"That is something I see so any women of all ages,"
RGFepU7VXcY,282560,284630,like even people younger than me
RGFepU7VXcY,284630,286860,like wearing little cardigans over dresses
RGFepU7VXcY,286860,289750,and that is something that seems very juvenile to me
RGFepU7VXcY,289750,290870,that you see like little five
RGFepU7VXcY,290870,292389,and six year old little girls wearing
RGFepU7VXcY,292390,293940,and I think there's just better options.
RGFepU7VXcY,293940,296140,"You could wear all kinds of different jackets, blazers."
RGFepU7VXcY,296140,298890,You could wear cardigans but maybe little bit oversized.
RGFepU7VXcY,298890,300390,It's like the little cardigans
RGFepU7VXcY,300390,304770,that are just again very juvenile actually ages you.
RGFepU7VXcY,304770,306349,"Now, speaking of dresses,"
RGFepU7VXcY,306350,309500,"that leads me to my next point kinda,"
RGFepU7VXcY,309500,311540,but let's talk about floral patterns
RGFepU7VXcY,311540,313570,because you see a lot of floral patterns
RGFepU7VXcY,313570,316910,"in dresses and pants and shirts, and just really everywhere."
RGFepU7VXcY,316910,318900,Florals are always in style
RGFepU7VXcY,318900,323900,"but I really think that the big, bulky, bold floral prints"
RGFepU7VXcY,324420,326280,make you look so much older
RGFepU7VXcY,326280,328580,and I don't really have any scientific evidence as to why.
RGFepU7VXcY,328580,331210,"I mean, I think as a general rule, big patterns"
RGFepU7VXcY,331210,332270,"aren't really that flattering,"
RGFepU7VXcY,332270,334819,"but I've always thought that more dainty,"
RGFepU7VXcY,334820,337860,"more feminine, more subtle floral patterns"
RGFepU7VXcY,337860,340259,makes you look so much more youthful.
RGFepU7VXcY,340260,341830,"Now you guys know, maybe you don't know"
RGFepU7VXcY,341830,343400,but I'm a purse girl.
RGFepU7VXcY,343400,347190,Like I have so many purses that are so not practical.
RGFepU7VXcY,347190,349561,"So a lot of, just taking this with a grain of salt."
RGFepU7VXcY,349561,353000,"Pockets on purses, like outside, photo,"
RGFepU7VXcY,353000,354480,this is what I'm talking about.
RGFepU7VXcY,354480,356700,So aging
RGFepU7VXcY,356700,359210,and this looks so not good.
RGFepU7VXcY,359210,360960,There are so many better things guys
RGFepU7VXcY,360960,363030,"and I know a lot of you like organization,"
RGFepU7VXcY,363030,364630,you wanna have like a spot for your ChapStick.
RGFepU7VXcY,364630,366568,You wanna have a spot for your keys.
RGFepU7VXcY,366568,368280,I understand the appeal
RGFepU7VXcY,368280,371090,but it's going to age you by like two decades.
RGFepU7VXcY,371090,373540,There are so many stylish purses out there
RGFepU7VXcY,373540,374600,that are very affordable
RGFepU7VXcY,374600,376920,and all you need is a purse organizer.
RGFepU7VXcY,376920,377900,They're like 20 bucks.
RGFepU7VXcY,377900,379630,You buy a nice tote.
RGFepU7VXcY,379630,381580,"It could be of good quality, it could be cheap."
RGFepU7VXcY,381580,382810,It doesn't even matter.
RGFepU7VXcY,382810,386070,"But a nice, sleek looking tote will hold so much"
RGFepU7VXcY,386070,388360,and then you can just put a handbag
RGFepU7VXcY,388360,390056,or purse organizer in there.
RGFepU7VXcY,390057,392420,You can have all of your pockets like concealed
RGFepU7VXcY,392420,394040,"and you can have a spot for everything,"
RGFepU7VXcY,394040,395520,but on the outside
RGFepU7VXcY,395520,396590,"you're gonna look really polished,"
RGFepU7VXcY,396590,398350,"you're gonna look chic, you're gonna look put together"
RGFepU7VXcY,398350,399640,and you're gonna look a lot younger.
RGFepU7VXcY,399640,401260,"Next, let's talk about glasses."
RGFepU7VXcY,401260,402670,"Now, this is another area"
RGFepU7VXcY,402670,405670,where I feel like people will probably get mad at me
RGFepU7VXcY,405670,407160,"because like, I don't have glasses."
RGFepU7VXcY,407160,409560,"So what can I really contribute here,"
RGFepU7VXcY,409560,412220,but I really spent like two hours researching this
RGFepU7VXcY,412220,413700,and I've come to a couple conclusions
RGFepU7VXcY,413700,415260,so just take whatever you want out of this.
RGFepU7VXcY,415260,417120,But I did see a big study
RGFepU7VXcY,417120,418699,where it pulled like
RGFepU7VXcY,418700,420760,hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
RGFepU7VXcY,420760,424080,and it did conclude that when you put on a pair of glasses
RGFepU7VXcY,424080,427960,it unfortunately does age you by at least five years.
RGFepU7VXcY,427960,429300,"So if you have contacts,"
RGFepU7VXcY,429300,431000,obviously that'll probably make you look younger
RGFepU7VXcY,431000,434850,but I do think that there can be really stylish glasses
RGFepU7VXcY,434850,436800,and I don't think it really matters
RGFepU7VXcY,436800,438500,what face shape you have.
RGFepU7VXcY,438500,440840,There's all of these different charts and everything.
RGFepU7VXcY,440840,442850,"Like if you have pear shape, you should wear this."
RGFepU7VXcY,442850,444610,"If you have a square face, you should wear this."
RGFepU7VXcY,444610,446669,And I really think it just comes down to
RGFepU7VXcY,446670,447720,you trying on glasses
RGFepU7VXcY,447720,449670,and whatever you think looks the best run with that
RGFepU7VXcY,449670,454250,because basically every rim style or shape
RGFepU7VXcY,454250,455920,is kind of in style these days.
RGFepU7VXcY,455920,457810,There's really not like a wrong answer
RGFepU7VXcY,457810,460850,but there is one particular style
RGFepU7VXcY,460850,462350,that absolutely ages you
RGFepU7VXcY,462350,463500,"and you should stay away from,"
RGFepU7VXcY,463500,465470,and that is any pair of glasses
RGFepU7VXcY,465470,468310,that has rhinestones or embellishments.
RGFepU7VXcY,468310,471090,"But other than that, run free,"
RGFepU7VXcY,471090,471980,go wild.
RGFepU7VXcY,471980,474790,"Now, if you're still wearing matching jewelry"
RGFepU7VXcY,474790,477300,like matching earrings that look almost identical
RGFepU7VXcY,477300,478133,"to the necklace,"
RGFepU7VXcY,478133,478990,and then it's real crazy
RGFepU7VXcY,478990,480470,when you get like a matching bracelet
RGFepU7VXcY,480470,481720,it's like a triple threat.
RGFepU7VXcY,481720,483300,I think that is definitely aging you
RGFepU7VXcY,483300,485419,making you look way older than you really are
RGFepU7VXcY,485420,487050,and I don't see this as much now
RGFepU7VXcY,487050,488900,because this really just is out of style
RGFepU7VXcY,488900,490100,and you can't even buy it
RGFepU7VXcY,490100,492750,like you use to just see the matching sets everywhere.
RGFepU7VXcY,492750,494660,But if you still have that in your jewelry box
RGFepU7VXcY,494660,497830,"I would say like, just don't put on all three,"
RGFepU7VXcY,497830,500349,"even today, I'm wearing some you yellow gold"
RGFepU7VXcY,500350,503550,with some white gold like I mix and match my medals.
RGFepU7VXcY,503550,506659,I think that's a great way to look youthful.
RGFepU7VXcY,506660,508010,"You could even just go even more subtle,"
RGFepU7VXcY,508010,509300,"like maybe throw in a pair of earrings,"
RGFepU7VXcY,509300,510300,but skip the necklace.
RGFepU7VXcY,510300,511210,"Now, throughout this video,"
RGFepU7VXcY,511210,514580,"I have been talking about very specific fashion choices,"
RGFepU7VXcY,514580,517510,"whether it be clothing or shoes or accessories,"
RGFepU7VXcY,517510,518990,but I wanna talk about hair
RGFepU7VXcY,518990,523640,because I think can really make a big improvement
RGFepU7VXcY,523640,525120,in making you look younger.
RGFepU7VXcY,525120,528210,And that's just choosing to try out lighter hair
RGFepU7VXcY,528210,530240,like a lighter blonder hair color.
RGFepU7VXcY,530240,532320,Now hear me out because I do have brown hair.
RGFepU7VXcY,532320,534560,I'm naturally a brunette
RGFepU7VXcY,534560,537460,"and I've had gray hair, no joke"
RGFepU7VXcY,537460,539070,"since, not tons of gray hair,"
RGFepU7VXcY,539070,542580,but strands of gray hair since I was in 11th grade.
RGFepU7VXcY,542580,543870,I remember being in English class
RGFepU7VXcY,543870,545589,and there was a mirror on the back of the door
RGFepU7VXcY,545590,546920,"and I was like, fixing my hair"
RGFepU7VXcY,546920,549500,"and I was like, oh my gosh, I see gray hairs"
RGFepU7VXcY,549500,550800,and they've been there ever since.
RGFepU7VXcY,550800,553870,So every few months I do have to dye my hair
RGFepU7VXcY,553870,557670,because I these weird gray hairs that continually grow.
RGFepU7VXcY,557670,559200,"However, it's not crazy yet"
RGFepU7VXcY,559200,561350,"and I'm sure as I age, it'll get worse and worse and worse."
RGFepU7VXcY,561350,563130,So I see a lot of women
RGFepU7VXcY,563130,567320,still with the brown hair or the dark hair
RGFepU7VXcY,567320,569120,with crazy gray roots.
RGFepU7VXcY,569120,571510,"And even if you keep on top of it,"
RGFepU7VXcY,571510,573140,"even within a week after dying your hair,"
RGFepU7VXcY,573140,574720,you start to see the gray roots
RGFepU7VXcY,574720,576470,and it's just makes you look a lot older.
RGFepU7VXcY,576470,578899,Whereas if you would try to transition slowly
RGFepU7VXcY,578900,579840,into lighter hair
RGFepU7VXcY,579840,583080,it really masks the grays as they come in
RGFepU7VXcY,583080,586380,and it just gives you a much more youthful appearance.
RGFepU7VXcY,586380,587490,Now I know there's people out there
RGFepU7VXcY,587490,590370,that choose to just embrace their grays
RGFepU7VXcY,590370,592670,and I think that's also great.
RGFepU7VXcY,592670,594660,I do think you're gonna look a little bit older
RGFepU7VXcY,594660,596129,"but hey, why not."
RGFepU7VXcY,596130,598550,"I mean, this is all just different suggestions"
RGFepU7VXcY,598550,601110,but I do think lighter hair will make you look younger.
RGFepU7VXcY,601110,602779,"Now in this video, we're obviously talking"
RGFepU7VXcY,602780,606010,"about ways fashion can make you look a lot older,"
RGFepU7VXcY,606010,608840,"but in this video, we're talking about eight ways"
RGFepU7VXcY,608840,612680,to buy cheap clothes that actually look really expensive.
RGFepU7VXcY,612680,615120,"So if you're new, make sure you subscribe,"
RGFepU7VXcY,615120,617653,but I'll see one over here. Bye.
