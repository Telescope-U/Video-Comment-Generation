86TRaQLjVfA,719,3040,among all the other effects of this war
86TRaQLjVfA,3040,5759,here in ukraine food is one of them the
86TRaQLjVfA,5759,8320,reality is that ukraine supplies so much
86TRaQLjVfA,8320,10080,food to the rest of the world places
86TRaQLjVfA,10080,12400,like africa and to the middle east and
86TRaQLjVfA,12400,15120,grains and other crops are sold on a
86TRaQLjVfA,15120,17359,world market basis and because of the
86TRaQLjVfA,17359,19600,war much of the food production here is
86TRaQLjVfA,19600,22000,not going to happen this year two-thirds
86TRaQLjVfA,22000,24080,of the crops have been planted in this
86TRaQLjVfA,24080,26000,area in ukraine that's actually pretty
86TRaQLjVfA,26000,27920,good considering a war is going on right
86TRaQLjVfA,27920,30240,now but a lot of last year's crop
86TRaQLjVfA,30240,33280,millions of tons of grain still sitting
86TRaQLjVfA,33280,35760,in silos can't go out to market and
86TRaQLjVfA,35760,38879,challenge for all of us how to sell the
86TRaQLjVfA,38879,41280,grain which will be produced
86TRaQLjVfA,41280,42000,and
86TRaQLjVfA,42000,44879,which is in growing now fixing that
86TRaQLjVfA,44879,46960,problem is not going to be easy experts
86TRaQLjVfA,46960,49039,say and the reality is there won't be
86TRaQLjVfA,49039,51360,enough food for all the people demanding
86TRaQLjVfA,51360,54559,it the worst is is is actually ahead of
86TRaQLjVfA,54559,56719,us because of the conflict in ukraine
86TRaQLjVfA,56719,58239,canadians are also going to feel the
86TRaQLjVfA,58239,59760,effects of this supply shortage not
86TRaQLjVfA,59760,61840,because there isn't enough wheat and
86TRaQLjVfA,61840,64320,other grain in canada for the market but
86TRaQLjVfA,64320,66799,prices are likely to be going up if
86TRaQLjVfA,66799,69520,access is not a problem
86TRaQLjVfA,69520,72640,then food affordability is with prices
86TRaQLjVfA,72640,74400,going up and canada is actually not
86TRaQLjVfA,74400,75759,immune to this
86TRaQLjVfA,75759,77759,we're seeing prices going up in canada
86TRaQLjVfA,77759,79759,as well so what's the solution to all of
86TRaQLjVfA,79759,82240,this well obviously it's the end of the
86TRaQLjVfA,82240,84799,war but that's nowhere in sight and the
86TRaQLjVfA,84799,86720,reality is with so many people in the
86TRaQLjVfA,86720,88640,world to feed we're normally fed by
86TRaQLjVfA,88640,90799,ukraine there's going to be a shortfall
86TRaQLjVfA,90799,92400,that's going to show up especially in
86TRaQLjVfA,92400,94560,the next few months sean o'shea global
86TRaQLjVfA,94560,98520,news in eastern ukraine
