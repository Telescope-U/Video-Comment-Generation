UK5OHUmIgcc,100960,102479,caffeine throughout the day so having
UK5OHUmIgcc,102479,104320,this stocked up with my go-to drinks is
UK5OHUmIgcc,104320,106560,a must in the studio the fridge itself
UK5OHUmIgcc,106560,108159,is nice and compact so it won't take up
UK5OHUmIgcc,108159,110320,much room at all and functionally it
UK5OHUmIgcc,110320,112159,gets the job done keeping drinks at
UK5OHUmIgcc,112159,114560,around a chilly 45 degrees fahrenheit
UK5OHUmIgcc,114560,117200,that is inside's a tiny led light up top

UK5OHUmIgcc,121759,123680,mirror you can switch it off on the back
UK5OHUmIgcc,123680,124960,it'll keep it running but not just
UK5OHUmIgcc,124960,126880,without the lights and sound wise it's a
UK5OHUmIgcc,126880,128800,very dull hum so it won't be loud enough
UK5OHUmIgcc,128800,130640,or audible enough to annoy you so if you

UK5OHUmIgcc,159200,160879,last three years all of my luster
UK5OHUmIgcc,160879,163120,profiles so you can check it out again
UK5OHUmIgcc,163120,164959,listed for you down below
UK5OHUmIgcc,164959,167360,now next up is this invisible phone
UK5OHUmIgcc,167360,169040,charger
UK5OHUmIgcc,169040,171680,you'll see so it does require some
UK5OHUmIgcc,171680,173920,physical things yes but once hooked up
UK5OHUmIgcc,173920,176000,it is invisible included in this kit is
UK5OHUmIgcc,176000,177840,the wireless charging pad and bracket
UK5OHUmIgcc,177840,179680,plus a coiled cheese sticker and they
UK5OHUmIgcc,179680,181040,give you magnets to make sure it's
UK5OHUmIgcc,181040,182640,aligned properly and to confirm the
UK5OHUmIgcc,182640,183840,thickness of your desk will actually
UK5OHUmIgcc,183840,185680,work with this so once you determine
UK5OHUmIgcc,185680,187040,where you want to place the wireless
UK5OHUmIgcc,187040,188879,charger using the magnets on the bottom
UK5OHUmIgcc,188879,190800,side of your desk stick the bracket
UK5OHUmIgcc,190800,192400,right in the middle through the magnets
UK5OHUmIgcc,192400,194239,this will then align it perfectly then
UK5OHUmIgcc,194239,195519,you can just slide in the wireless
UK5OHUmIgcc,195519,196959,charger so it charges through your
UK5OHUmIgcc,196959,199040,desktop surface without you physically
UK5OHUmIgcc,199040,201360,needing it on top but to strengthen that
UK5OHUmIgcc,201360,203360,wireless connection the conductive cheat
UK5OHUmIgcc,203360,205519,coil sticker will go directly on top of
UK5OHUmIgcc,205519,207440,where the pad is mounted underneath this
UK5OHUmIgcc,207440,209519,will give you now two options one you
UK5OHUmIgcc,209519,210720,can either just have the smallest
UK5OHUmIgcc,210720,212640,charger in the world with the sticker or
UK5OHUmIgcc,212640,214400,you can big brain it and have it hidden
UK5OHUmIgcc,214400,216080,under your mouse pad like i'm doing
UK5OHUmIgcc,216080,217599,going forward now you'll just have to
UK5OHUmIgcc,217599,219599,remember where the placement actually is
UK5OHUmIgcc,219599,221200,but in terms of having a wireless
UK5OHUmIgcc,221200,223760,charger on your desktop this is by far
UK5OHUmIgcc,223760,226239,the cleanest way to do so it's invisible
UK5OHUmIgcc,226239,227760,and it beats alternative solutions out
UK5OHUmIgcc,227760,229200,there that require you to like drill
UK5OHUmIgcc,229200,231760,holes in your desk this completely drill
UK5OHUmIgcc,231760,234080,free and it's nicely hidden out of sight
UK5OHUmIgcc,234080,235360,and you can always have your phone
UK5OHUmIgcc,235360,237360,charging wirelessly at your desktop for
UK5OHUmIgcc,237360,239519,just under 30
UK5OHUmIgcc,239519,241360,quick little note my desktop behind me
UK5OHUmIgcc,241360,243599,which is a solid piece of acacia wood
UK5OHUmIgcc,243599,245360,does not work with this it's just too
UK5OHUmIgcc,245360,247040,thick over there and also if you have a
UK5OHUmIgcc,247040,249040,phone case on it might not work either
UK5OHUmIgcc,249040,250640,so if you want you know raw doggy
UK5OHUmIgcc,250640,253120,bareback with no case and you have a
UK5OHUmIgcc,253120,255200,desktop that is not a thick butcher
UK5OHUmIgcc,255200,257600,block like i do you should be fine
UK5OHUmIgcc,257600,259600,next isn't a piece of technology but
UK5OHUmIgcc,259600,261199,it's for your desk and you know we show
UK5OHUmIgcc,261199,262960,off a ton of different desk gadgets here
UK5OHUmIgcc,262960,264479,for your setup so i think it's going to
UK5OHUmIgcc,264479,266160,be useful for you guys it makes the cut
UK5OHUmIgcc,266160,268240,today this is an under desk storage
UK5OHUmIgcc,268240,269840,drawer and it doesn't get any more
UK5OHUmIgcc,269840,272000,obvious than that simply mount this
UK5OHUmIgcc,272000,273600,under your desk to keep all the desktop
UK5OHUmIgcc,273600,275680,clutter down or just to have things at
UK5OHUmIgcc,275680,277759,an arm's reach things like i don't know
UK5OHUmIgcc,277759,280240,flash drives memory cards pens pencils
UK5OHUmIgcc,280240,282479,charging cables all that stuff you get
UK5OHUmIgcc,282479,284400,the idea right extra storage is always
UK5OHUmIgcc,284400,286560,clutch because who doesn't need more i
UK5OHUmIgcc,286560,288160,just keep it at my filming desk so i can
UK5OHUmIgcc,288160,290240,rotate between props and my lighting
UK5OHUmIgcc,290240,292240,remotes unboxing knives it's definitely
UK5OHUmIgcc,292240,294240,a convenient pickup this one is the
UK5OHUmIgcc,294240,296800,larger listing at nine by eight by three
UK5OHUmIgcc,296800,299199,so it's not large by my definition but
UK5OHUmIgcc,299199,300720,again for the items that often will
UK5OHUmIgcc,300720,302560,clutter up your desk this will keep them
