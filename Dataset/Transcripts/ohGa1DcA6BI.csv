ohGa1DcA6BI,6706,7707,WELCOME TO
ohGa1DcA6BI,7707,9809,"""TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT."""
ohGa1DcA6BI,9809,11010,HAPPY FRIDAY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,11010,14280,"IN RETROSPECT, JOE BIDEN'S FIRST"
ohGa1DcA6BI,14280,16816,TERM POLICY AGENDA SEEMS VERY
ohGa1DcA6BI,16816,18051,"OPTIMISTIC, ALMOST COMICALLY"
ohGa1DcA6BI,18051,18685,OPTIMISTIC.
ohGa1DcA6BI,18685,20019,"SHORTLY BEFORE HIS INAUGURATION,"
ohGa1DcA6BI,20019,21654,HE ANNOUNCED SOMETHING HE CALLED
ohGa1DcA6BI,21654,23856,"THE ""BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA."""
ohGa1DcA6BI,23856,25759,"WE MOCKED IT AT THE TIME, BUT"
ohGa1DcA6BI,25759,27927,LOOKING BACK IN SOME WAYS IT WAS
ohGa1DcA6BI,27927,28695,A HOPEFUL DOCUMENT.
ohGa1DcA6BI,28695,30496,AMERICA MUST'VE BEEN A VERY RICH
ohGa1DcA6BI,30496,31864,COUNTRY BACK THEN.
ohGa1DcA6BI,31864,33600,AND BY BACK THEN WE MEAN LAST
ohGa1DcA6BI,33600,34300,YEAR.
ohGa1DcA6BI,34300,35034,THERE WEREN'T A LOT OF
ohGa1DcA6BI,35034,37370,ESSENTIALS IN BIDEN'S AGENDA.
ohGa1DcA6BI,37370,39138,THE FIRST THREE THINGS THAT ANY
ohGa1DcA6BI,39138,41274,NORMAL NATION NEEDS AND THINKS
ohGa1DcA6BI,41274,42442,"ABOUT OBSESSIVELY OUR FOOD,"
ohGa1DcA6BI,42442,44210,"WATER, AND ENERGY."
ohGa1DcA6BI,44210,45645,THAT IS THE STANDARD.
ohGa1DcA6BI,45645,47814,"IN CHINA FOR EXAMPLE, EVERY"
ohGa1DcA6BI,47814,51150,GOVERNMENT POLICY IS DESIGNED
ohGa1DcA6BI,51150,54487,ABOVE ALL TO PRESERVE ATTIC
ohGa1DcA6BI,54487,56055,"ADEQUATE FOOD, WATER, ENERGY"
ohGa1DcA6BI,56055,57023,BEER THAT MAKES SENSE.
ohGa1DcA6BI,57023,58591,THE BUILD BACK JUMPED ON MUCH
ohGa1DcA6BI,58591,59325,BETTER AGENDA WAS THE OPPOSITE
ohGa1DcA6BI,59325,61661,OF THAT.
ohGa1DcA6BI,61661,63796,IT DID NOT ADDRESS ANY CONCERN
ohGa1DcA6BI,63796,64530,ON WHETHER AMERICANS MIGHT HAVE
ohGa1DcA6BI,64530,66399,ENOUGH TO EAT OR AFFORD NOT TO
ohGa1DcA6BI,66399,69836,FREEZE TO DEATH.
ohGa1DcA6BI,69836,70903,FOCUSED ON THE KIND OF ADDED
ohGa1DcA6BI,70903,72605,EXTRAS YOU GET TO WHEN YOU FIX
ohGa1DcA6BI,72605,74240,EVERYTHING ELSE AND THEN STILL
ohGa1DcA6BI,74240,76309,HAVE TRILLIONS LEFT OVER.
ohGa1DcA6BI,76309,78611,BUILD BACK BETTER PROMISED SO
ohGa1DcA6BI,78611,80713,"SOMETHING CALLED ""ENVIRONMENTAL"
ohGa1DcA6BI,80713,81046,"EQUITY."""
ohGa1DcA6BI,81046,82348,IT DEMANDED AMNESTY FOR MILLIONS
ohGa1DcA6BI,82348,83583,OF ILLEGAL ALIENS BECAUSE AT THE
ohGa1DcA6BI,83583,87053,TIME THE AMERICAN ECONOMY SEEMED
ohGa1DcA6BI,87053,87987,ROBUST ENOUGH TO SHARE WITH THE
ohGa1DcA6BI,87987,91190,ENTIRE WORLD.
ohGa1DcA6BI,91190,92959,BIDEN CALLED FOR FREE SOLAR
ohGa1DcA6BI,92959,94560,PANELS FOR EVERYBODY AND
ohGa1DcA6BI,94560,97463,TAXPAYER FUNDED PRE-K FOR ALL
ohGa1DcA6BI,97463,98998,AMERICAN PARENTS AND SO ON AND
ohGa1DcA6BI,98998,99298,SO ON.
ohGa1DcA6BI,99298,104037,IT WAS THE NEOLIBERAL VERSION OF
ohGa1DcA6BI,104037,106439,"FLYING CARS, LUXURIES THAT FOR A"
ohGa1DcA6BI,106439,108207,MOMENT IN TIME SEEMED ALMOST
ohGa1DcA6BI,108207,108641,WITHIN REACH.
ohGa1DcA6BI,108641,110043,A LOT HAS CHANGED.
ohGa1DcA6BI,110043,111577,NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT FLYING
ohGa1DcA6BI,111577,112245,CARS ANYMORE.
ohGa1DcA6BI,112245,115315,HERE IS JOE BIDEN FROM 
ohGa1DcA6BI,115315,115682,YESTERDAY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,115682,116482,">> WITH REGARD TO FOOD SHORTAGE,"
ohGa1DcA6BI,116482,118551,"YES, WE DID -- WE WILL TALK"
ohGa1DcA6BI,118551,121020,ABOUT FOOD SHORTAGES.
ohGa1DcA6BI,121020,122321,IT IS GOING TO BE REAL.
ohGa1DcA6BI,122321,124523,THE PRICE OF THESE SANCTIONS IS
ohGa1DcA6BI,124523,126492,NOT JUST IMPOSED UPON RUSSIA.
ohGa1DcA6BI,126492,130062,IT IS IMPOSED UPON AN AWFUL LOT
ohGa1DcA6BI,130062,131197,OF COUNTRIES IS WELCOME
ohGa1DcA6BI,131197,131964,INCLUDING EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND
ohGa1DcA6BI,131964,136235,OUR COUNTRY AS WELL.
ohGa1DcA6BI,136235,138438,BOTH RUSSIA AND UKRAINE HAVE
ohGa1DcA6BI,138438,139839,BEEN THE BREADBASKET OF EUROPE
ohGa1DcA6BI,139839,141174,"IN TERMS OF WEIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE,"
ohGa1DcA6BI,141174,145078,JUST TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE.
ohGa1DcA6BI,145078,145745,>> Tucker: FOOD SHORTAGES.
ohGa1DcA6BI,145745,148581,THEY ARE GOING TO BE REAL --
ohGa1DcA6BI,148581,151283,"ONCE AGAIN, IN CASE YOU MISSED"
ohGa1DcA6BI,151283,152752,"IT, FOOD SHORTAGES."
ohGa1DcA6BI,152752,155588,"NOT IN SUDAN, AND CINCINNATI."
ohGa1DcA6BI,155588,161627,I WAS IN HER BIG CITIES ALSO SO.
ohGa1DcA6BI,161627,162895,OUR PROBLEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN
ohGa1DcA6BI,162895,164030,"HAVING TOO MUCH FOOD, NOW WE"
ohGa1DcA6BI,164030,166265,WON'T HAVE ENOUGH.
ohGa1DcA6BI,166265,166932,WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE
ohGa1DcA6BI,166932,167633,PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
ohGa1DcA6BI,167633,168835,JUST TOLD US THAT ON CAMERA.
ohGa1DcA6BI,168835,171270,WHAT IS THIS GOING TO MEAN?
ohGa1DcA6BI,171270,173005,HOW DO FOOD SHORTAGES AFFECT A
ohGa1DcA6BI,173005,173339,COUNTRY?
ohGa1DcA6BI,173339,174874,IF YOU ARE TO GO ONLINE AND READ
ohGa1DcA6BI,174874,176876,"ABOUT IT, ALL OF RECORDED"
ohGa1DcA6BI,176876,177943,HISTORY WILL ANSWER YOUR
ohGa1DcA6BI,177943,178310,QUESTION.
ohGa1DcA6BI,178310,179378,FOOD SHORTAGE IS NOT LIKE
ohGa1DcA6BI,179378,180146,DECIDING TO SKIP DESSERT.
ohGa1DcA6BI,180146,183549,"IT IS NOT A DIET, IT IS NOT"
ohGa1DcA6BI,183549,183916,VOLUNTARY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,183916,185284,A FOOD SHORTAGE IS DIFFERENT.
ohGa1DcA6BI,185284,186686,IT IS SCARY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,186686,188654,IT DOES TOPPLED GOVERNMENTS AND
ohGa1DcA6BI,188654,189522,TURNING MODERATES INTO
ohGa1DcA6BI,189522,189989,REVOLUTIONARIES.
ohGa1DcA6BI,189989,191290,"A FOOD SHORTAGE IS A BIG DEAL,"
ohGa1DcA6BI,191290,192492,YOU DON'T WANT ONE.
ohGa1DcA6BI,192492,193693,BUT NOW WE ARE GETTING ONE.
ohGa1DcA6BI,193693,195561,JUST A LITTLE OVER A YEAR INTO
ohGa1DcA6BI,195561,197430,JOE BIDEN'S PRESIDENCY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,197430,198598,THINK FORWARD.
ohGa1DcA6BI,198598,199832,IF THE TRADITIONAL CALENDAR
ohGa1DcA6BI,199832,202435,"HOLDS, WE'VE GOT 1,032 DAYS LEFT"
ohGa1DcA6BI,202435,204470,OF THE JOE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION
ohGa1DcA6BI,204470,206305,AND YOU WONDER WHAT THINGS WILL
ohGa1DcA6BI,206305,207507,LOOK LIKE BY THEN.
ohGa1DcA6BI,207507,209475,WE ARE SPEEDING TOWARDS A
ohGa1DcA6BI,209475,209842,DYSTOPIA.
ohGa1DcA6BI,209842,210576,NOT THAT THEY SEEM TO CARE IN
ohGa1DcA6BI,210576,212278,ANY WAY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,212278,215715,HERE'S TREASURY SECRETARY JANET
ohGa1DcA6BI,215715,217283,ALLEN FROM THIS MORNING TO LET
ohGa1DcA6BI,217283,218451,YOU KNOW IT'S TIME TO STOP
ohGa1DcA6BI,218451,220653,WHINING ABOUT GAS PRICES BECAUSE
ohGa1DcA6BI,220653,222088,"ACTUALLY, THEY ARE NOT VERY"
ohGa1DcA6BI,222088,222388,HIGH.
ohGa1DcA6BI,222388,223756,>> HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK OIL

ohGa1DcA6BI,230196,231297,UNCERTAINTY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,231297,232364,THEY ARE NOT AS HIGH IN REAL
ohGa1DcA6BI,232364,236302,TERMS AS THEY WERE EARLIER IN
ohGa1DcA6BI,236302,240807,THIS CENTURY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,240807,242875,"AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S CONCEIVABLE"
ohGa1DcA6BI,242875,244210,THAT THEY COULD MOVE HIGHER.

ohGa1DcA6BI,245645,246912,"BIG DEAL, SETTLE DOWN HERE THERE"
ohGa1DcA6BI,246912,248681,IS A REASON FOR IT.
ohGa1DcA6BI,248681,250216,"AS JOE BIDEN EXPLAINED, YOU ARE"
ohGa1DcA6BI,250216,252085,PAYING MORE FOR GAS BECAUSE WE
ohGa1DcA6BI,252085,253719,HAVE SLAP SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA.
ohGa1DcA6BI,253719,254420,SANCTIONING RUSH IS THE RIGHT
ohGa1DcA6BI,254420,258890,THING TO DO.
ohGa1DcA6BI,258890,262061,"FOR SOME PEOPLE, THIS MIGHT SEEM"
ohGa1DcA6BI,262061,262962,"LIKE AN ADEQUATE ANSWER, BUT"
ohGa1DcA6BI,262962,266499,"OTHERS IN GOOD FAITH MAY ASK,"
ohGa1DcA6BI,266499,268167,"OKAY, I'M NOT AGAINST SANCTIONS"
ohGa1DcA6BI,268167,270903,"AND THEORY, BUT SINCE THEY ARE"
ohGa1DcA6BI,270903,271604,CLEARLY NOT HURTING PUTIN AND
ohGa1DcA6BI,271604,272972,"THEY ARE HEARD IN MY FAMILY,"
ohGa1DcA6BI,272972,274273,WHAT IS THE POINT OF SANCTIONS?
ohGa1DcA6BI,274273,275274,IS THERE A POINT?
ohGa1DcA6BI,275274,278911,"LET ME KNOW, MAKE ME FEEL "
ohGa1DcA6BI,278911,279312,BETTER.
ohGa1DcA6BI,279312,280580,"THE ANSWER IS YES, THERE IS A"
ohGa1DcA6BI,280580,282048,POINT TO SANCTIONS BEAR THEY ARE
ohGa1DcA6BI,282048,283115,DESIGNED TO PREVENT RUSSIA FROM

ohGa1DcA6BI,313513,314780,ACTUALLY WORK.
ohGa1DcA6BI,314780,315915,PUTIN INVADED UKRAINE ANYWAY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,315915,316949,THE SANCTIONS FAILED.
ohGa1DcA6BI,316949,321087,SO WHAT IS THE RESPONSE?
ohGa1DcA6BI,321087,322855,JOE BIDEN IS PRETENDING THE
ohGa1DcA6BI,322855,323823,ADMINISTRATION NEVER CLAIMED TO

ohGa1DcA6BI,325290,327627,HERE IS THE NEW LINE.
ohGa1DcA6BI,327627,329061,>> LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT.
ohGa1DcA6BI,329061,331030,IF YOU COVERED ME FROM THE VERY
ohGa1DcA6BI,331030,333666,"BEGINNING, I DID NOT SAY THAT IN"
ohGa1DcA6BI,333666,335434,FACT THESE SANCTIONS WOULD DETER

ohGa1DcA6BI,381347,382682,BEEN SO DAMAGED BY THE iPHONE
ohGa1DcA6BI,382682,384517,IT WILL BE AS FORGETFUL AS
ohGa1DcA6BI,384517,385117,JOE BIDEN HIMSELF.
ohGa1DcA6BI,385117,387954,NOW THEY WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT
ohGa1DcA6BI,387954,389922,SANCTIONING RUSSIA CAN FORCE
ohGa1DcA6BI,389922,391123,PUTIN INTO WITHDRAWING FROM
ohGa1DcA6BI,391123,391891,UKRAINE.
ohGa1DcA6BI,391891,392758,IS THAT TRUE?
ohGa1DcA6BI,392758,394593,CAN PUTIN BE SANCTIONED INTO

ohGa1DcA6BI,395094,397062,"WE CERTAINLY HOPE IT IS TRUE,"
ohGa1DcA6BI,397062,397930,SINCERELY.
ohGa1DcA6BI,397930,398964,BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT IT
ohGa1DcA6BI,398964,399899,IS TRUE.
ohGa1DcA6BI,399899,401334,IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY AN
ohGa1DcA6BI,401334,404369,EXPECTATION THAT IT IS TRUE.
ohGa1DcA6BI,404369,405738,EVEN JOE BIDEN DIDN'T CLAIM THAT
ohGa1DcA6BI,405738,407206,WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
ohGa1DcA6BI,407206,408674,SO WHAT IS THE POINT?
ohGa1DcA6BI,408674,410676,"WE ARE NOT SURE, THAT IS A TOPIC"
ohGa1DcA6BI,410676,412511,FOR ANOTHER SHOW.

ohGa1DcA6BI,456655,458424,IS STILL NOT CLEAR.

ohGa1DcA6BI,459625,460993,"IF THERE'S A GOOD POINT, PEOPLE"
ohGa1DcA6BI,460993,462061,WILL PUT UP WITH IT.
ohGa1DcA6BI,462061,464563,WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHAT THAT

ohGa1DcA6BI,465131,467099,FERTILIZER BILLS ARE EXPECTED TO
