VuG4BcghOSg,4000,6560,biggest most giant tech that you've ever
VuG4BcghOSg,6560,9200,seen a giant
VuG4BcghOSg,9200,11120,keyboard
VuG4BcghOSg,11120,13599,that's amazing this is the one i've just
VuG4BcghOSg,13599,15200,got to figure out how to import it okay
VuG4BcghOSg,15200,16880,so we're gonna need a huge mouse to go
VuG4BcghOSg,16880,17920,with that
VuG4BcghOSg,17920,19439,huge mouse
VuG4BcghOSg,19439,22080,oh my god
VuG4BcghOSg,22080,24880,oh okay it's not a mouse that was
VuG4BcghOSg,24880,27199,alarming anyway oh
VuG4BcghOSg,27199,28400,i think we might have our winner here
VuG4BcghOSg,28400,30080,but now i gotta get a giant mouse mat
VuG4BcghOSg,30080,30800,too
VuG4BcghOSg,30800,33200,i can feel myself falling into the hole
VuG4BcghOSg,33200,34719,ah we have a mouse pad here which is
VuG4BcghOSg,34719,37840,claiming to be world's largest extended
VuG4BcghOSg,37840,41920,large extra extra extra large that'll do
VuG4BcghOSg,41920,44160,the job i'm starting to picture a setup
VuG4BcghOSg,44160,46000,coming together um what's the biggest
VuG4BcghOSg,46000,47840,monitor we can get this could actually
VuG4BcghOSg,47840,49600,work a quad hd
VuG4BcghOSg,49600,53440,49 inch curved samsung panel
VuG4BcghOSg,53440,55039,i think that's the one what else do you
VuG4BcghOSg,55039,56399,use in a setup
VuG4BcghOSg,56399,59039,headphones i need some giant headphones
VuG4BcghOSg,59039,59920,oh
VuG4BcghOSg,59920,62879,my god can you imagine if you could buy
VuG4BcghOSg,62879,64559,this and it was like a working pair of
VuG4BcghOSg,64559,66640,headphones that's perfect they've
VuG4BcghOSg,66640,68720,literally just taken airpods pro and
VuG4BcghOSg,68720,70560,super sized them it actually looks
VuG4BcghOSg,70560,71920,really good maybe that's just the photo
VuG4BcghOSg,71920,73119,though oh
VuG4BcghOSg,73119,75759,no that's even better so this is a
VuG4BcghOSg,75759,77600,company who has literally created an
VuG4BcghOSg,77600,80080,actual stereo pair of speakers that are
VuG4BcghOSg,80080,82320,based on the design of a normal pair of
VuG4BcghOSg,82320,84400,earphones that they also sell that's
VuG4BcghOSg,84400,86400,literally that is perfect for this video
VuG4BcghOSg,86400,88400,okay so let's buy that and then also the
VuG4BcghOSg,88400,90240,pair of earphones that they're based on
VuG4BcghOSg,90240,91520,i'm quite surprised with how this is
VuG4BcghOSg,91520,93200,coming together i feel like i need some
VuG4BcghOSg,93200,96079,giant tools to like fit with my new
VuG4BcghOSg,96079,98479,giant lifestyle biggest

VuG4BcghOSg,116240,118960,but that's probably for the best that's
VuG4BcghOSg,118960,120399,still pretty cool maybe it's one of
VuG4BcghOSg,120399,121280,those things that you have to kind of

VuG4BcghOSg,232000,234319,than i thought it could be so let's go
VuG4BcghOSg,234319,237360,in size order from large to giant to
VuG4BcghOSg,237360,239920,colossal so this is our smartwatch i
VuG4BcghOSg,239920,241680,mean this packaging is pretty compact it
VuG4BcghOSg,241680,243680,doesn't look huge you only realize how
VuG4BcghOSg,243680,245360,big the thing is when you see it sitting
VuG4BcghOSg,245360,247280,on your wrist it feels kind of amazing
VuG4BcghOSg,247280,249040,just to have a full android device on
VuG4BcghOSg,249040,251200,your wrist at all times you could watch
VuG4BcghOSg,251200,253680,mr use the boss videos on loop
VuG4BcghOSg,253680,255760,tell me that's not the dream why is it
VuG4BcghOSg,255760,257759,got a camera oh
VuG4BcghOSg,257759,259680,it's on the side so does that mean you
VuG4BcghOSg,259680,263040,can take a selfie if you
VuG4BcghOSg,263040,264880,does make your wrist pretty sore though
VuG4BcghOSg,264880,266720,that is very cool though but i have a
VuG4BcghOSg,266720,268560,feeling things are about to get crazier
VuG4BcghOSg,268560,271040,because this is a lighter
VuG4BcghOSg,271040,273759,why this exists i couldn't tell you but
VuG4BcghOSg,273759,275360,there's one question that's probably on
VuG4BcghOSg,275360,278080,all of our minds does a bigger lighter
VuG4BcghOSg,278080,280160,mean a bigger flame
VuG4BcghOSg,280160,281600,it's definitely sparking there could
VuG4BcghOSg,281600,283520,literally be anything inside of here i'm
VuG4BcghOSg,283520,285360,putting a lot of trust in this all it's
VuG4BcghOSg,285360,287600,giving me is just a ton of smoke
VuG4BcghOSg,287600,290080,come on
VuG4BcghOSg,290960,293199,yeah that didn't work
VuG4BcghOSg,293199,297639,did we need to put fluid in that
VuG4BcghOSg,299120,300320,is that the
VuG4BcghOSg,300320,302320,is that the box of a tablet
VuG4BcghOSg,302320,304160,the size of a pc
VuG4BcghOSg,304160,306240,as far as i'm aware this is the largest
VuG4BcghOSg,306240,309199,consumer android tablet on the market so
VuG4BcghOSg,309199,310400,for perspective
VuG4BcghOSg,310400,313280,this is a full-size ipad air
VuG4BcghOSg,313280,316240,this is a galaxy view 2.
VuG4BcghOSg,316240,317919,imagine just chilling on your bed
VuG4BcghOSg,317919,319600,flicking through the internet on this
VuG4BcghOSg,319600,321440,screen and the second you don't want to
VuG4BcghOSg,321440,322960,hold it anymore you just pull out the
VuG4BcghOSg,322960,325600,stand and plop it down or alternatively
VuG4BcghOSg,325600,327520,break every bone in your face if you
VuG4BcghOSg,327520,330160,accidentally drop it this keyboard is a
VuG4BcghOSg,330160,332160,monster am i the only one who thinks
VuG4BcghOSg,332160,334160,this is amazing
VuG4BcghOSg,334160,336080,all right the time has come to build our
VuG4BcghOSg,336080,338320,super sized gaming setup so just for
VuG4BcghOSg,338320,340240,context this is the size of my normal
VuG4BcghOSg,340240,342720,computer mouse and you know most
VuG4BcghOSg,342720,344639,computer mice
VuG4BcghOSg,344639,348080,but this ain't no ordinary mouse
VuG4BcghOSg,348400,351400,holy
VuG4BcghOSg,352960,354840,look at it
VuG4BcghOSg,354840,357360,[Laughter]
VuG4BcghOSg,357360,360080,that's just ridiculous like no joke this
VuG4BcghOSg,360080,362240,needs two hands to use properly let's
VuG4BcghOSg,362240,363360,plug it in
VuG4BcghOSg,363360,365440,some part of me really likes this it's
VuG4BcghOSg,365440,368560,even got like a jumbo sized clicker
VuG4BcghOSg,368560,370960,hey milo you want a big mouse
VuG4BcghOSg,370960,372240,i'm not gonna lie to you this is
VuG4BcghOSg,372240,374800,actually really usable all i need now is
VuG4BcghOSg,374800,377840,a jumbo mouse mat
VuG4BcghOSg,377840,379440,would you look at that
VuG4BcghOSg,379440,381199,as far as i'm aware this is the largest
VuG4BcghOSg,381199,384560,mouse mat money can buy
VuG4BcghOSg,390639,394759,i think it's the size of my table
VuG4BcghOSg,395759,398639,who is this made for it's a super low
VuG4BcghOSg,398639,401440,friction material i feel like such a pro
VuG4BcghOSg,401440,403440,even though i probably look like such a
VuG4BcghOSg,403440,406160,tool oh yeah and then we have the
VuG4BcghOSg,406160,408560,keyboard
VuG4BcghOSg,408560,410880,this thing was an absolute pain in the
VuG4BcghOSg,410880,413360,butt to find i went to every single site
VuG4BcghOSg,413360,415520,i actually tried to become a wholesaler
VuG4BcghOSg,415520,417120,just so i could import a batch from
VuG4BcghOSg,417120,419440,china but then i managed to find one
VuG4BcghOSg,419440,421440,more unit literally one unit left in
VuG4BcghOSg,421440,423120,stock at micro center in the united
VuG4BcghOSg,423120,424639,states so i asked my friend kevin to
VuG4BcghOSg,424639,426639,pick one up for me and send it this way
VuG4BcghOSg,426639,429360,the point is this keyboard is super rare
VuG4BcghOSg,429360,430479,and also
VuG4BcghOSg,430479,432720,you have never seen anything like it i
VuG4BcghOSg,432720,435120,almost can't believe this is real but
VuG4BcghOSg,435120,436639,you want to know the best bit each of
VuG4BcghOSg,436639,439520,these giant keys has a custom made giant
VuG4BcghOSg,439520,441360,mechanical switch behind it for proper
VuG4BcghOSg,441360,444240,tactile feedback
VuG4BcghOSg,444240,447918,they're such meaty keys
VuG4BcghOSg,449440,450880,oh my god
VuG4BcghOSg,450880,452240,oh
VuG4BcghOSg,452240,456479,this is so nice it feels so good
VuG4BcghOSg,456479,459199,i got the compliments in the video this
VuG4BcghOSg,459199,461520,is genuinely the nicest keyboard i've
VuG4BcghOSg,461520,463120,ever used in my life you know that's
VuG4BcghOSg,463120,465280,really funny i've just realized so you
VuG4BcghOSg,465280,466800,might know that with keyboards you have
VuG4BcghOSg,466800,468319,multiple different key layouts depending
VuG4BcghOSg,468319,470080,on how much space you have for that
VuG4BcghOSg,470080,472160,board this one's actually been designed
VuG4BcghOSg,472160,474960,using the compact layout irony
VuG4BcghOSg,474960,479120,at its finest but of course
VuG4BcghOSg,479120,481199,we have a screen too
VuG4BcghOSg,481199,484720,this is our 49-inch
VuG4BcghOSg,484720,487440,samsung ultra wide monitor
VuG4BcghOSg,487440,488479,is that
VuG4BcghOSg,488479,491280,is that a g on energy efficiency
VuG4BcghOSg,491280,493160,samsung
VuG4BcghOSg,493160,496639,[Music]
VuG4BcghOSg,496639,498000,now if you're one of the the three
VuG4BcghOSg,498000,500240,people who've been subscribed since 2011
VuG4BcghOSg,500240,501440,then you'll have seen that the very
VuG4BcghOSg,501440,503840,first pc i ever built had a triple
VuG4BcghOSg,503840,506800,monitor setup well this is what happens
VuG4BcghOSg,506800,509440,when you blend three monitors into one
VuG4BcghOSg,509440,510800,you're ready for the best peel of your
VuG4BcghOSg,510800,513559,life
VuG4BcghOSg,513559,518320,[Music]
VuG4BcghOSg,524240,526320,a little bit naughty that i can have
VuG4BcghOSg,526320,528880,like seven full windows open at once and
VuG4BcghOSg,528880,530959,because it's such a big screen the curve
VuG4BcghOSg,530959,533200,is actually useful because it wraps
VuG4BcghOSg,533200,536000,around you also giant screen wipe to
VuG4BcghOSg,536000,538320,keep the entire thing clean
VuG4BcghOSg,538320,540240,quite possibly
VuG4BcghOSg,540240,541760,one stroke
VuG4BcghOSg,541760,543519,i am quite enjoying living the large
VuG4BcghOSg,543519,544480,life
VuG4BcghOSg,544480,546640,but wait a second right now i'm powering
VuG4BcghOSg,546640,549200,all of this stuff off a tiny human-sized
VuG4BcghOSg,549200,550640,macbook
VuG4BcghOSg,550640,554240,we need a pc that can keep up
VuG4BcghOSg,554399,557760,oh that transition didn't work
VuG4BcghOSg,557760,559920,this is going to blow your mind
VuG4BcghOSg,559920,562880,underneath this curtain is a custom pc
VuG4BcghOSg,562880,564480,made by probably one of the most
VuG4BcghOSg,564480,566880,creative people on the planet this is
VuG4BcghOSg,566880,569760,the largest most ridiculous sweetest rig
VuG4BcghOSg,569760,572080,you've probably ever seen all right it's
VuG4BcghOSg,572080,575560,reveal time
VuG4BcghOSg,576800,580000,oh my god
VuG4BcghOSg,580080,581760,what you're looking at right now is
VuG4BcghOSg,581760,584640,extreme two terabytes of ram the highest
VuG4BcghOSg,584640,588399,end graphics card in the world and
VuG4BcghOSg,588480,592000,where's the on button oh yeah
VuG4BcghOSg,592000,594399,that's because it's not a pc the reason
VuG4BcghOSg,594399,596480,i'm in like absolute awe right now is
VuG4BcghOSg,596480,599440,that what you're looking at
VuG4BcghOSg,600480,602959,is a cake this is the largest edible
VuG4BcghOSg,602959,605839,gaming pc in the world
VuG4BcghOSg,605839,608399,maybe the only one too i've never been
VuG4BcghOSg,608399,610800,this nervous to cut something
VuG4BcghOSg,610800,613440,let's just do it okay five
VuG4BcghOSg,613440,614640,four
VuG4BcghOSg,614640,615760,three

VuG4BcghOSg,620720,622160,oh my god
VuG4BcghOSg,622160,623920,i never thought i'd need the gym for a
VuG4BcghOSg,623920,624800,cake
VuG4BcghOSg,624800,627440,all the way all the way nearly there oh
VuG4BcghOSg,627440,630160,my god this smells amazing i'm gonna
VuG4BcghOSg,630160,632720,have to cut it from two sides
VuG4BcghOSg,632720,634640,are you ready to see the inside biggest
VuG4BcghOSg,634640,638399,slice of cake in existence okay
VuG4BcghOSg,638399,641120,holy cow
VuG4BcghOSg,641120,642320,oh
VuG4BcghOSg,642320,644399,that's like 30 layers
VuG4BcghOSg,644399,647440,what does it taste like
VuG4BcghOSg,647440,649440,that is incredible
VuG4BcghOSg,649440,651200,i've had one-eighth of a slice and i'm
VuG4BcghOSg,651200,654079,already so full this cake could feed a
VuG4BcghOSg,654079,656480,city
VuG4BcghOSg,656560,660480,okay now we're moving to the giant stuff
VuG4BcghOSg,660480,662880,oh no you're not giant darling he thinks
VuG4BcghOSg,662880,664720,i call him fat
VuG4BcghOSg,664720,666720,if this is what i think it is then you
VuG4BcghOSg,666720,668480,might be looking at world's largest
VuG4BcghOSg,668480,671360,pencil not technically tech but
VuG4BcghOSg,671360,675480,how often do you get to see a 44-incher
VuG4BcghOSg,675760,678240,let's do it
VuG4BcghOSg,680320,682320,this is such a weapon
VuG4BcghOSg,682320,684160,all right let's see what it can oh oh
VuG4BcghOSg,684160,685440,that's a problem
VuG4BcghOSg,685440,688640,time to see what it can do oh my god i
VuG4BcghOSg,688640,690000,feel like i've got a rocket launcher on
VuG4BcghOSg,690000,692640,my back oh if you like giant videos like
VuG4BcghOSg,692640,694560,this then it's up to the channel would
VuG4BcghOSg,694560,696720,be
VuG4BcghOSg,699040,702040,monumental
VuG4BcghOSg,702399,706000,a little pencil flick to finish off
VuG4BcghOSg,707360,709600,that really hurt
VuG4BcghOSg,709600,711920,i am so excited about this one so this
VuG4BcghOSg,711920,714240,company elecon they make normal sized
VuG4BcghOSg,714240,716160,earphones i bought a pair here they're
VuG4BcghOSg,716160,718000,actually pretty well regarded in japan
VuG4BcghOSg,718000,719279,but then also
VuG4BcghOSg,719279,721440,super sized versions of those same
VuG4BcghOSg,721440,724079,earphones so let's open the normal ones
VuG4BcghOSg,724079,726160,this feels like a pretty traditional
VuG4BcghOSg,726160,728079,unboxing experience for standard
VuG4BcghOSg,728079,731560,higher-end earphones
VuG4BcghOSg,732079,734560,they do feel high quality very dense and
VuG4BcghOSg,734560,737760,uh reassuring but then
VuG4BcghOSg,737760,739760,when you supersize that
VuG4BcghOSg,739760,741440,i feel like my brain is playing tricks
VuG4BcghOSg,741440,744639,on me earphones should not be this big
VuG4BcghOSg,744639,748240,even the peel tabs are super sized
VuG4BcghOSg,752639,754560,no way
VuG4BcghOSg,754560,757519,this is perfect this is exactly what i
VuG4BcghOSg,757519,761200,was hoping for wow
VuG4BcghOSg,765839,767920,we did it i know we've already seen
VuG4BcghOSg,767920,769920,ridiculous but this might actually be
VuG4BcghOSg,769920,773839,the most ridiculous yet
VuG4BcghOSg,774399,776079,for anyone who ever tells you tech is
VuG4BcghOSg,776079,778560,not cool
VuG4BcghOSg,778560,780240,they've supersized the earphones but
VuG4BcghOSg,780240,781760,also the cable
VuG4BcghOSg,781760,783120,they've even supersized the volume
VuG4BcghOSg,783120,785920,control can you imagine wearing these
VuG4BcghOSg,785920,788079,all right time to see how these absolute
VuG4BcghOSg,788079,791639,units sound
VuG4BcghOSg,794550,799440,[Music]
VuG4BcghOSg,799440,800399,it's like out
VuG4BcghOSg,800399,801200,but
VuG4BcghOSg,801200,803839,if there was speakers
VuG4BcghOSg,803839,806560,which is obvious but it
VuG4BcghOSg,806560,808320,i can't describe it i'm just gonna say
VuG4BcghOSg,808320,809279,it now
VuG4BcghOSg,809279,811680,product of the year i do also have these
VuG4BcghOSg,811680,812800,other ones
VuG4BcghOSg,812800,815040,shout out to the hulk who was clearly
VuG4BcghOSg,815040,816959,the one handling this package this is
VuG4BcghOSg,816959,818720,still pretty cool but
VuG4BcghOSg,818720,820320,i feel like that last one just stole my
VuG4BcghOSg,820320,820680,heart
VuG4BcghOSg,820680,823120,[Music]
VuG4BcghOSg,823120,824639,everybody's got a favorite chocolate
VuG4BcghOSg,824639,825680,right
VuG4BcghOSg,825680,828560,well fun fact mine is toborone what
VuG4BcghOSg,828560,830320,you're about to see was actually the
VuG4BcghOSg,830320,832639,inspiration for this video
VuG4BcghOSg,832639,835360,so this is a normal 100 gram toblerone
VuG4BcghOSg,835360,836480,bar
VuG4BcghOSg,836480,838800,it is definitely a lot of chocolate but
VuG4BcghOSg,838800,841440,the honey the the nuttiness just the
VuG4BcghOSg,841440,843279,flavor i could take one of these down
VuG4BcghOSg,843279,845680,myself
VuG4BcghOSg,848880,851120,but then you get to the 200 gram bar and
VuG4BcghOSg,851120,853040,as much as i am an absolute animal when
VuG4BcghOSg,853040,854880,it comes to food let's be honest it
VuG4BcghOSg,854880,857120,would take at least two people to tango
VuG4BcghOSg,857120,859199,on this one
VuG4BcghOSg,859199,861040,but you can actually go bigger because
VuG4BcghOSg,861040,864720,this right here is the 360 gram bar and
VuG4BcghOSg,864720,866399,i love how everything is exactly the
VuG4BcghOSg,866399,868560,same just scaled up this one could feed
VuG4BcghOSg,868560,870639,an entire family but that's not what
VuG4BcghOSg,870639,872399,we're here for we don't want to feed a
VuG4BcghOSg,872399,873519,family
VuG4BcghOSg,873519,876079,we want to feed 20.
VuG4BcghOSg,876079,878000,what you're looking at right now
VuG4BcghOSg,878000,879120,is 4
VuG4BcghOSg,879120,883720,500 grams of toblerone
VuG4BcghOSg,884320,885519,never
VuG4BcghOSg,885519,889600,in my wildest dreams did i think
VuG4BcghOSg,889600,893240,i'd be doing this
VuG4BcghOSg,900320,902480,that one block is probably as much
VuG4BcghOSg,902480,905199,chocolate as this entire bar let's dive
VuG4BcghOSg,905199,907279,in
VuG4BcghOSg,908560,910560,exactly the same quality
VuG4BcghOSg,910560,912399,this is that block with a full mouthful
VuG4BcghOSg,912399,915440,of chocolate taken out
VuG4BcghOSg,915440,917760,i almost forgot about the toothbrush
VuG4BcghOSg,917760,919680,i've still got no idea if this is a
VuG4BcghOSg,919680,922240,prank or a prop it's only just occurring
VuG4BcghOSg,922240,924480,to me how obscene the size of this thing
VuG4BcghOSg,924480,927120,is
VuG4BcghOSg,927120,928720,it's actually really well timed right
VuG4BcghOSg,928720,932879,after the october the good news is
VuG4BcghOSg,934880,938240,i don't think they were joking
VuG4BcghOSg,938240,941560,look at this
VuG4BcghOSg,943920,945040,i
VuG4BcghOSg,945040,948720,cannot believe it
VuG4BcghOSg,948800,951120,i do actually have some disclosing
VuG4BcghOSg,951120,953440,tablets so if i chew this thing it will
VuG4BcghOSg,953440,955680,coat my teeth in purple so in theory
VuG4BcghOSg,955680,958480,i'll be able to see how well this cleans
VuG4BcghOSg,958480,960160,okay
VuG4BcghOSg,960160,962399,i promise i clean my teeth
VuG4BcghOSg,962399,964320,i don't know what i'm doing here okay
VuG4BcghOSg,964320,966880,just give it an absolutely enormous glow
VuG4BcghOSg,966880,968320,what do they normally say pea sized
VuG4BcghOSg,968320,970639,amount
VuG4BcghOSg,971230,978779,[Music]
VuG4BcghOSg,979120,981199,carpet burn i feel like i've just been
VuG4BcghOSg,981199,984240,attacked my teeth cleaned
VuG4BcghOSg,984240,986399,okay we are getting to the very largest
VuG4BcghOSg,986399,989199,now so inside this box should be the
VuG4BcghOSg,989199,992000,largest light bulb on the internet i've
VuG4BcghOSg,992000,994160,gone through like a 25 minute unboxing
VuG4BcghOSg,994160,996079,already just to get the other pieces out
VuG4BcghOSg,996079,998320,nearly broke my camera trying to film it
VuG4BcghOSg,998320,1002180,but the bulb itself is in here
VuG4BcghOSg,1002180,1004880,[Music]
VuG4BcghOSg,1004880,1007440,oh gosh
VuG4BcghOSg,1009120,1010880,it's like a vase
VuG4BcghOSg,1010880,1013839,let's put this on the stand
VuG4BcghOSg,1013839,1015920,where is the filament
VuG4BcghOSg,1015920,1016959,oh
VuG4BcghOSg,1016959,1019279,you put a small bulb inside the bigger
VuG4BcghOSg,1019279,1021040,bowl you know when people say they have
VuG4BcghOSg,1021040,1023519,like a light bulb moment
VuG4BcghOSg,1023519,1026240,this feels like the opposite of that
VuG4BcghOSg,1026240,1027520,do you want to see
VuG4BcghOSg,1027520,1030079,the biggest thing of them all though
VuG4BcghOSg,1030079,1032880,how about a 100 inch nintendo switch
VuG4BcghOSg,1032880,1034798,so i've had these joy-con controllers
VuG4BcghOSg,1034798,1036959,custom-made and then mounted them on the
VuG4BcghOSg,1036959,1039520,biggest screen i own i was actually
VuG4BcghOSg,1039520,1040959,thinking of turning them into working
VuG4BcghOSg,1040959,1043199,controllers that you could play with too
VuG4BcghOSg,1043199,1044558,but then i realized you wouldn't
VuG4BcghOSg,1044558,1045678,actually be able to play anything if
VuG4BcghOSg,1045678,1047199,they're stuck five meters away from you
VuG4BcghOSg,1047199,1049120,and what would actually be a massive
VuG4BcghOSg,1049120,1052000,lifesaver was if they were also cabinets
VuG4BcghOSg,1052000,1052720,so
VuG4BcghOSg,1052720,1054799,all that junk that's been sitting around
VuG4BcghOSg,1054799,1056559,is now gone
VuG4BcghOSg,1056559,1059120,i love this so much oh yeah and if
VuG4BcghOSg,1059120,1060080,you're wondering what the whole thing
VuG4BcghOSg,1060080,1062080,was running off well of course the
VuG4BcghOSg,1062080,1064480,world's largest power bank
VuG4BcghOSg,1064480,1066559,not because i needed to just because
VuG4BcghOSg,1066559,1068720,it's crazy that i can
VuG4BcghOSg,1068720,1070480,okay this video would definitely not
VuG4BcghOSg,1070480,1071600,have been possible without the good
VuG4BcghOSg,1071600,1074400,folks over at morning brew and it's not
VuG4BcghOSg,1074400,1076400,what it sounds like it's not an app or a
VuG4BcghOSg,1076400,1078640,website or a coffee
VuG4BcghOSg,1078640,1080400,it's an email newsletter
VuG4BcghOSg,1080400,1082080,so here's the idea you pop your email
VuG4BcghOSg,1082080,1083919,address onto their site and then once
VuG4BcghOSg,1083919,1085919,per morning monday to sunday they will
VuG4BcghOSg,1085919,1087600,send you a five minute summary on
VuG4BcghOSg,1087600,1089360,everything important in business finance
VuG4BcghOSg,1089360,1090480,and tech
VuG4BcghOSg,1090480,1092400,and i'm a strong believer in the
VuG4BcghOSg,1092400,1094880,ideology because it's being sent to you
VuG4BcghOSg,1094880,1096640,it's such an easy way to substitute
VuG4BcghOSg,1096640,1097919,checking instagram first thing in the
VuG4BcghOSg,1097919,1099440,morning to actually learning something
VuG4BcghOSg,1099440,1101600,that you can talk to people about so for
VuG4BcghOSg,1101600,1103280,example the other day it had a piece in
VuG4BcghOSg,1103280,1105679,it all about samsung so samsung's just
VuG4BcghOSg,1105679,1107440,announced that they're going to build a
VuG4BcghOSg,1107440,1110320,17 billion dollar chip plant in texas
VuG4BcghOSg,1110320,1112320,united states and
VuG4BcghOSg,1112320,1114320,they're not the only ones the us is
VuG4BcghOSg,1114320,1115760,basically trying to make sure that they
VuG4BcghOSg,1115760,1118160,never have a chip shortage again and so
VuG4BcghOSg,1118160,1119280,they're also making sure at the same
VuG4BcghOSg,1119280,1121440,time that texas has heaps of tax
VuG4BcghOSg,1121440,1123840,incentives for tech companies to the
VuG4BcghOSg,1123840,1125600,point where these companies are pouring
