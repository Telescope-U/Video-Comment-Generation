gmzwsMx3Rfc,5586,7523,How do 3D Glasses Work?
gmzwsMx3Rfc,8653,9313,Simple.
gmzwsMx3Rfc,9784,13053,Take 3 D's and add them Together.
gmzwsMx3Rfc,13953,15279,Oh AumSum.
gmzwsMx3Rfc,17053,22338,As our eyes are slightly apart from each other they see two slightly different images.
gmzwsMx3Rfc,24000,29318,Our Brain receives these two images and puts them together in a single three-dimensional image.
gmzwsMx3Rfc,30686,33105,This helps our brain in depth perception.
gmzwsMx3Rfc,35128,41538,"In 3D theaters, two projectors which are synchronized with each other are used to project 2 different views."
gmzwsMx3Rfc,42159,44996,"Each with a different polarization, onto the screen."
gmzwsMx3Rfc,46487,51875,"Now, the 3D Glasses which we wear contain lenses with different polarization."
gmzwsMx3Rfc,52664,57667,Each one of them allows only a single image of a specific polarization to enter our eye.
gmzwsMx3Rfc,58010,61372,The other image of a different polarization is not allowed to enter.
gmzwsMx3Rfc,63559,65711,The rest is taken care of by our brain.
gmzwsMx3Rfc,67034,69312,"Hence, we are able to watch 3D movies."
gmzwsMx3Rfc,70113,72262,This is how 3D Glasses work.
