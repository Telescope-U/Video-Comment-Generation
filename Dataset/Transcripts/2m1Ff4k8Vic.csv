2m1Ff4k8Vic,1359,3639,cigars are the great equalizer you know
2m1Ff4k8Vic,3639,6069,it sounds cheesy but there's a common
2m1Ff4k8Vic,6069,7930,bond shared by people that enjoy cigars
2m1Ff4k8Vic,7930,9820,but now there's a competitive angle as
2m1Ff4k8Vic,9820,12040,well if you're familiar with cigars you
2m1Ff4k8Vic,12040,13929,know what they do then you have a shot
2m1Ff4k8Vic,13929,17129,and this low smoking tour there
2m1Ff4k8Vic,19930,23770,my name is Darrin chopping and I am was
2m1Ff4k8Vic,23770,26770,a competitive smoker the competition is
2m1Ff4k8Vic,26770,28630,it sounds complicated but it's really
2m1Ff4k8Vic,28630,29349,very simple
2m1Ff4k8Vic,29349,31360,everyone is past this the same sized
2m1Ff4k8Vic,31360,33400,cigar which is a Morava sized cigar and
2m1Ff4k8Vic,33400,35470,you have one minute to cut it any way
2m1Ff4k8Vic,35470,37449,you like then they start the official
2m1Ff4k8Vic,37449,39100,time and you have one minute to light
2m1Ff4k8Vic,39100,41140,the cigar but once that minute is over
2m1Ff4k8Vic,41140,42940,there's no more recognition of the cigar
2m1Ff4k8Vic,42940,45460,so then it becomes how long can you
2m1Ff4k8Vic,45460,46600,smoke the thing and there are other
2m1Ff4k8Vic,46600,48220,things that come into it like you know
2m1Ff4k8Vic,48220,49360,you're not allowed to put the cigar down
2m1Ff4k8Vic,49360,50620,you're not allowed to blow through it
2m1Ff4k8Vic,50620,52210,you know let's blow on it you're not
2m1Ff4k8Vic,52210,53739,allowed to make it wet you can't leave
2m1Ff4k8Vic,53739,55930,the table you can't ash for 40 minutes
2m1Ff4k8Vic,55930,57580,and there are penalty minutes if you do
2m1Ff4k8Vic,57580,59199,accidentally ash based on when you do
2m1Ff4k8Vic,59199,59619,ash
2m1Ff4k8Vic,59619,61180,you can't drink or talk for the first
2m1Ff4k8Vic,61180,63190,five minutes and a nutshell you're slow
2m1Ff4k8Vic,63190,70420,smoking you know it's all about how the
2m1Ff4k8Vic,70420,72220,cigar is burning and what you know the
2m1Ff4k8Vic,72220,73689,minutia that you're looking at as it's
2m1Ff4k8Vic,73689,75850,going on but you're just sort of dancing
2m1Ff4k8Vic,75850,77740,on the edge of not smoking right like if
2m1Ff4k8Vic,77740,79060,you're not smoking enough the cigar will
2m1Ff4k8Vic,79060,80530,go out and if you smoke too much then
2m1Ff4k8Vic,80530,82420,you'll have a bad time so you just want
2m1Ff4k8Vic,82420,84040,to find that right balance and not let
2m1Ff4k8Vic,84040,87550,the cigar get away from you oh my god I
2m1Ff4k8Vic,87550,90640,smoked I was about 25 to 30 cigars a
2m1Ff4k8Vic,90640,92890,week back in the days we only saw that
2m1Ff4k8Vic,92890,95260,in the Godfather movie and stuff like
2m1Ff4k8Vic,95260,98320,that right cigar smoke needs to relax
2m1Ff4k8Vic,98320,102220,and to unwind from a long day to war but
2m1Ff4k8Vic,102220,104110,when you're competing all that stuff
2m1Ff4k8Vic,104110,105520,goes out of the window and now you are
2m1Ff4k8Vic,105520,108250,your mind setting so I want to win I
2m1Ff4k8Vic,108250,111610,want to be known as the winner and so it
2m1Ff4k8Vic,111610,114640,becomes a little more stressful you
2m1Ff4k8Vic,114640,116470,don't really enjoy that smoke because
2m1Ff4k8Vic,116470,118390,you're not really smoking that much just
2m1Ff4k8Vic,118390,120760,toshing it right but you want to win and
2m1Ff4k8Vic,120760,122350,you just want to give there all right so
2m1Ff4k8Vic,122350,125680,look I just I think I lost no I lost
2m1Ff4k8Vic,125680,127520,points
