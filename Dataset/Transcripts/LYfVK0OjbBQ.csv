LYfVK0OjbBQ,146319,153040,palate to its absolute limit oh god you  can feel the warmth of the animal  just so you can witness some of the most
LYfVK0OjbBQ,153040,158080,extreme so they have all the organs raw  exotic some blood undocumented food
LYfVK0OjbBQ,158080,163680,practices in africa and this is the bile  anya
LYfVK0OjbBQ,163680,167400,she's saying it's so good
LYfVK0OjbBQ,175920,182000,today we're visiting members of the  zigua tribe an agricultural society  that's befriended one of nature's most
LYfVK0OjbBQ,182000,187760,hated creatures oh wow that's a big one  what's your own gumbo i've arrived just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,187760,193280,in time as plans for a community feast  are underway this is the beef that's  been roasting here we also do have
LYfVK0OjbBQ,193280,200400,chicken heads on a stick i don't know  that's going to be a minnesota state  fair food anytime soon and trust me  you've never seen food like this oh my
LYfVK0OjbBQ,200400,205760,god that's a piece of head was it  looking through there at one point this  two-day event is about to begin and it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,205760,209799,all starts here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,212000,218400,morning from tanzania today we are in a  segura village of about 1800 people the  zegua people reside mainly in a small
LYfVK0OjbBQ,218400,223920,coastal region in northeastern tanzania  to learn more about this hidden culture  there's no better occasion than a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,223920,229680,gathering like what we'll see today and  tomorrow  i'm gonna be witness to an entire cow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,229680,235519,being slaughtered and prepared for a  ceremonial feast the only problem is  they don't have any cows or livestock
LYfVK0OjbBQ,235519,240599,here that means we're gonna have to go  elsewhere to find it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,240640,246560,even though tanzania is home to over 100  different unique tribes that are  different in almost all aspects from
LYfVK0OjbBQ,246560,252159,language to religious beliefs these  groups still associate peacefully with  one another right now we are on our way
LYfVK0OjbBQ,252159,258479,to the messiah village i got to hang out  with the messiah a few years ago in  kenya this is a pastoral nomadic society
LYfVK0OjbBQ,258479,263680,all these guys eat is milk okay this is  breakfast here blood how do you find it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,263680,269759,milky and meat what is going on this is  goat sushi so it's so different from the  zigua tribe because here they have
LYfVK0OjbBQ,269759,276560,vegetables and they have crops so  they're very agricultural it's almost  impossible for these two tribes to  intermingle because the cattle from one
LYfVK0OjbBQ,276560,281600,tribe is going to eat the plants from  the other tribe right now the people of  the zugua tribe they want a cow so
LYfVK0OjbBQ,281600,287919,they're gonna have to trade something  for it whether it's crops or some  chickens or whatever they have that they  can offer
LYfVK0OjbBQ,287919,293280,after just a four mile ride we've  arrived at a maasai village
LYfVK0OjbBQ,294720,300800,so right here we've come to the grazing  pastures they can't just stay all day in  the pen they actually have to be brought
LYfVK0OjbBQ,300800,307440,out to wherever the food is today it's  here for today's event this is the  chosen one a young calf praised for its
LYfVK0OjbBQ,307440,313759,tender and sweet meat it looks like he's  gonna try to hook it by the leg it's  tough because they trust the shepherd
LYfVK0OjbBQ,313759,320919,they're usually around the shepherd but  as soon as he starts being weird they  all know something's up they'll try to  run away
LYfVK0OjbBQ,324270,329840,[Music]  starting from here they need to walk it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,329840,334960,all the way back to where we started  today so we took motorcycles here but uh  the cow can't exactly take a motorcycle
LYfVK0OjbBQ,334960,340480,back  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,341759,347919,while the calf takes its final walk to  the zigua village a group of  entertainers arrives bravely toting bags
LYfVK0OjbBQ,347919,353280,of deadly reptiles  i don't know what's going on yet there's  a giant python right here and then this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,353280,359680,guy is kind of playing with it these are  the zegua snake men known locally as the  one and gully
LYfVK0OjbBQ,359680,365120,holy cow he's not pleased  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,365120,371680,alas the calf has arrived to the village  and food preparation can begin  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,371680,378240,the calf is dispatched then portioned  into different cuts ready to be cooked  in the meantime just a few steps away
LYfVK0OjbBQ,378240,383440,villagers and entertainers are gathering  in larger and larger numbers  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,383440,389360,as the one and go nimbly prance among  the snakes it becomes immediately clear  that only a handful of villagers know
LYfVK0OjbBQ,389360,395280,how to handle these creatures while in  the periphery the rest look on with the  light and terror now that is dangerous
LYfVK0OjbBQ,395280,401440,he put it around his neck oh i put a  little bit on me  oh boy they can really squeeze the heck
LYfVK0OjbBQ,401440,409639,out of you  under the cooking tree things are also  heating up
LYfVK0OjbBQ,410240,416830,all of the calf meat is portioned and  hanged overnight waiting for tomorrow's  village feast
LYfVK0OjbBQ,416830,424880,[Music]  but tonight we dine on offals topped  liver is braised with ginger and salt
LYfVK0OjbBQ,424880,433039,on the other side tripe and intestine  but first the intestine has to be  braided  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,433039,438080,that's not the only braiding going on  oh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,438080,444479,all right oh oh yeah sure we can die  together the snake is pissed but it's  not squeezing our life out yet oh okay i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,444479,450560,see what looks like a black mamba what  i'm pretty sure is the world's deadliest  snake oh my gosh elisa python i know
LYfVK0OjbBQ,450560,457840,it's not venomous what do we do do we  dance  this tantalizing snake dance routine is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,457840,463360,not a rare sight here but i can't tell  if this is a religious ceremony a  spiritual ritual or just pure
LYfVK0OjbBQ,463360,469360,entertainment for the village folk  that's what i call a tick-tock dance  while i joined the snake dance the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,469360,476840,intestine and tripe joined together in a  pot with salt and a bit of lime  then boiled
LYfVK0OjbBQ,478080,483759,it for the food but not by the snakes  now that the group dance is complete
LYfVK0OjbBQ,483759,490240,it's time for the solo should i grab it  oh oh that's not the side i want to be  on see this is dangerous right here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,490240,495680,because it's coiled up it can just lurch  out at any moment  yes he went for the bike i know it'd be
LYfVK0OjbBQ,495680,502479,very entertaining for me to catch it i  have caught one before in florida but  i'm in the middle of nowhere in africa  if it does latch onto me no it's not
LYfVK0OjbBQ,502479,507840,poisonous or venomous but it's gonna  wrap around me and it's gonna be like a  thousand little razor cuts on my arm so
LYfVK0OjbBQ,507840,513039,as much as i want to catch it for the  entertainment value and my ego wants to  show off to these people it's probably
LYfVK0OjbBQ,513039,518839,not a good idea maybe tomorrow i think i  have a lot more to learn about how this  place works let's come back
LYfVK0OjbBQ,518839,524560,tomorrow alas dinner has begun with  elder members of the tribe the whole cow  the whole calf i should say is going to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,524560,529680,be prepared tomorrow but usually i've  seen this many places now to prepare  some of the innards the night before and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,529680,535600,that's what we have here lots of good  stuff the only problem is i don't have a  translator but i do have this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,535600,540959,here they speak their tribal language  and the national language swahili tina  languni
LYfVK0OjbBQ,540959,547600,sunny  that's right oh this is very useful how  do you say let's eat  i'm a teacher we are teachers a clerk a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,547600,553120,tourist a visitor i'm not feeling well  i'm sick i should not say that ah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,553519,556000,let's eat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,559040,564639,so everyone pitched in everyone helped  create what we see here and it looks  quite stunning
LYfVK0OjbBQ,569120,577279,liver i'm going to try some of this  liver  [Music]  oh you say yummy i could say may i go
LYfVK0OjbBQ,577279,584080,now  the liver is outstanding liver can be  really dry sometimes it's moist it's  plum it's juicy this is real good i feel
LYfVK0OjbBQ,584080,589440,like if you're not eating enough hugali  and you're eating too much meat people  will give you the side eye so i'm gonna  pretend that i want to eat some of this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,589440,595920,ukulele  ugali is found with nearly every meal in  this country cornmeal mixed with water
LYfVK0OjbBQ,595920,601760,remember saadza in zimbabwe this is the  exact same thing but with a different  name they're saying mix ugali whip it so
LYfVK0OjbBQ,601760,608480,this is okra mixed with beans and it is  so slimy it's like japanese nettle
LYfVK0OjbBQ,608720,613760,you really taste the okra but it's so  slimy and gooey it's a very fun texture  i like it kind of the deal is with every
LYfVK0OjbBQ,613760,619040,food the utensil is either your hands or  the uganda make it into a little bit of  a ball put your thumb into it grab some
LYfVK0OjbBQ,619040,625120,of this pumpkin leaf  i  love that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,625120,630959,heart  a lot of the food is going fast there's  one thing that's not going that quick  that is the intestines and the tripe
LYfVK0OjbBQ,630959,639230,here's what i like about the intestines  they braided it it's going to be chewy  and potentially delicious  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,641200,647920,when they braid it like that it creates  such an intense squishy texture it's a  little bit like some kind of a squishy  palamari yeah yeah this is kind of our
LYfVK0OjbBQ,647920,653279,starter meal this is our entryway into  the village into this community into the  meal we're gonna be having tomorrow am i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,653279,659440,making it weird just because i'm talking  to myself is that is that awkward  everyone stopped talking  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,659440,665519,day two with the zigua tribe today the  entire village will partake in a mammoth  beast i have a ridiculous amount here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,665519,670959,that i could never hope to eat  and i'll learn the secrets behind  africa's snake tribe wow that's a big
LYfVK0OjbBQ,670959,677040,one  [Music]  how are you i'm great joining me today
LYfVK0OjbBQ,677040,683519,goomba local of tanzania and fixer for  our entire journey in this country next  to him the chief how does one become a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,683519,690160,chief exactly  this man has been chief since 1973  that's 11 years before my parents
LYfVK0OjbBQ,690160,695600,accidentally conceived me they don't use  like a democratic way on how to select  the leaders and then instead of a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,695600,701680,four-year term it's more like a 50-year  term  i think the first thing we should do is  break some bread together there's a few
LYfVK0OjbBQ,701680,707760,different things here this is called a  one mandazi the making of mandazi starts  with wheat flour sugar yeast and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,707760,712880,sunflower oil mixed with water and  kneaded into a ball
LYfVK0OjbBQ,713120,720240,flatten the ball on a cutting board and  cut it into squares or triangles or  diamonds you know shapes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,720240,725420,now fry until they turn into golden  brown puffy pillowy chunks of heaven
LYfVK0OjbBQ,725420,731680,[Music]  oh i love it it's just a delicious fried
LYfVK0OjbBQ,731680,737040,bread very doughy on the inside it has  that fried outer coat that's so fun to  crunch through it reminds me of a new
LYfVK0OjbBQ,737040,742800,orleans beignet without the powdered  sugar does something get dipped into the  porridge you can use the same mandate
LYfVK0OjbBQ,742800,748320,this porch is made from corn right yeah  these corn kernels are left to soften  overnight in the morning they're pounded
LYfVK0OjbBQ,748320,755279,into a powder  mix that corn powder with water stirring  continuously over fire until it forms a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,755279,762800,thick porridge  [Music]  as an agricultural community corn sesame
LYfVK0OjbBQ,762800,768399,and saiso are the principal crops in  zigua fields the zigwa people they are  farmers right but they only practice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,768399,775279,small farming raising chicken and not  like commercial farming is there a  reason that they focus more on  agriculture
LYfVK0OjbBQ,775680,780959,they don't have any trade skills to do  anything so just a lack of knowledge  lack of experience yeah experience nice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,780959,787120,i want to try this quality video it's  like a little tanzanian donut you do  more batter is a tasty mixture of rice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,787120,793440,flour yeast and coconut milk  fry the batter in a specially molded
LYfVK0OjbBQ,793440,798360,tray until the outer coat crisps up
LYfVK0OjbBQ,802639,809360,oh my god this is unbelievable  it's like a little bit of natural  sweetness from the coconut milk in there  super crunchy on the outside doughy on
LYfVK0OjbBQ,809360,814720,the inside is this stuff that you ate  from the time you were a kid  this is not what i expected when i came
LYfVK0OjbBQ,814720,822399,here i knew there would be certain  staples like ugali meat you know stuff  that just comes from animals but this is  on a different level
LYfVK0OjbBQ,822880,827920,this is something i'm super fascinated  with it appears that the people here  follow or at least are influenced by the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,827920,833839,muslim faith so are people here muslim  they are muslim the primary religion  practiced by the zika people is sunni
LYfVK0OjbBQ,833839,839920,islam the largest branch of islam  children are often sent to muslim  schools for religious studies however
LYfVK0OjbBQ,839920,845600,like many african tribes spiritual  beliefs are strong in the community so  it's not always easy to tell where
LYfVK0OjbBQ,845600,851040,islamic customs end and more traditional  spiritual practices begin
LYfVK0OjbBQ,851040,856720,i was here yesterday and there were a  bunch of people they brought snakes in  bags they let them out and from my point  of view it looked like a show there must
LYfVK0OjbBQ,856720,862160,be some purpose beyond that what are  they doing with the snakes it's not  everyone who can do that you have to be  trained to become full-fledged in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,862160,869279,ongoing more specialized snake handlers  it's like they are rituals i don't know  actually to learn more about this  unusual and unexpected relationship
LYfVK0OjbBQ,869279,874639,between snakes and the zika people we're  meeting up with the one and goalie  leader and he's brought with him a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,874639,881120,little friend  is that a python yeah it's a prize oh  wow that's a big one ah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,881120,886980,what's your own gumbo it's not scary  don't worry no i'm not scary but i don't  want to touch them
LYfVK0OjbBQ,886980,894959,[Applause]  how much does this one weigh do you have  any idea  more than 50 kg over 100 pounds
LYfVK0OjbBQ,895920,901360,come on you're getting out of frame  you're ruining our shots as farmers  segua members are often hanging out
LYfVK0OjbBQ,901360,907120,where potentially dangerous snakes are  also hanging out one and goli men are  here to treat snake bites with various
LYfVK0OjbBQ,907120,912399,herbs and traditional methods for the  snake bite here in the village they  normally appreciate these guys compared
LYfVK0OjbBQ,912399,917920,to the hospital how long have you been  doing this type of job  it's more than 42 years what use do you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,917920,923120,have for these snakes so they normally  take the snake going to the forest to  collect the medicine they are sure that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,923120,930720,if they go this particular snake they'll  be able to win whatever they're going to  do in the forest so the snake is good  luck yeah they're good
LYfVK0OjbBQ,930800,936240,when villagers gather the one and  goalies stand out thanks to their red  bandanas a great branding idea i may
LYfVK0OjbBQ,936240,941920,consider trying for myself the stunts i  witnessed yesterday that's their way of  educating villagers on the topic of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,941920,948079,snakes showing that man and nature can  live in harmony even if that nature is  trying to bite you in the face we always
LYfVK0OjbBQ,948079,953759,have this kind of neck because they see  this as the king of all snakes when you  have this kind of snake you can also
LYfVK0OjbBQ,953759,960160,have another type of snake kind of like  if you can handle this snake you can  handle any snakes that's correct now  that the mystery of these snake charmers
LYfVK0OjbBQ,960160,966639,has been revealed i'm tempted to join  their squad  but first there's a whole village
LYfVK0OjbBQ,966639,969839,waiting to be fed
LYfVK0OjbBQ,972399,978079,there is a lot going on cooking has  started from morning even before  breakfast after an overnight marination
LYfVK0OjbBQ,978079,983680,the beef ribs and quarters are ready to  hit the grill here a very unique style  they built it out of wood and then they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,983680,988959,put a little bit of like a steel fence  on top and they just put big chunks of  meat on top of that so that's been
LYfVK0OjbBQ,988959,995120,roasting for hours kind of low and slow  then as you come down here you could see  the chicken so the chicken has been put
LYfVK0OjbBQ,995120,1001440,between two pieces of wood i've seen  chicken prepared like this in thailand  too so it must be a common thing  throughout the world it's an easy way to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1001440,1006720,hold the chicken and keep it from going  anywhere while you're grilling it while  the chicken is still far from being done
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1006720,1013199,the fragrance from this beef is luring  me in for a bite can we try this my man  could you cut a little bit
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1013199,1018560,oh  this looks real good  oh we got some juicy beef here here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1018560,1025600,please  i mean as long as we're being rude and  eating before everyone else i need to  take someone else down with me
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1025600,1030959,oh that's right on the outside where all  the seasonings have been it's like a  tasty dried out shell it's very juicy on
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1030959,1036959,the inside it's not super soft it's not  like it's a filet mignon or wagyu it's  got a little chew to it but it's good

LYfVK0OjbBQ,1250159,1256400,some of the flavors of that rice  definitely one of my favorite things  i've had so far in this village last but  not least chapati paired with chicken
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1256400,1262400,soup  the chicken hidden under the grilling  rack from earlier is hacked up and  boiled into a soup with various
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1262400,1268080,vegetables  here we have a leg oh they cut off the  nails the gizzard with a bonus intestine
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1268080,1273440,attached you can take the chapati use  that like a spoon or a fork and eating  utensils i'm gonna grab this use the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1273440,1278720,intestine i'm gonna make like a little  bit of a taco out of it i don't know if  anybody has ever had a taco in their  life
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1278720,1284320,[Applause]  clean chewy intestines and chapati it's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1284320,1292240,just flaky delicious layered bread i  love it so much  i have one thing to try out that i will  just do for the fans
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1292320,1299280,did i see this and get excited did i  look at this chicken head and think oh  my god i must try it it must be in my  mouth no not exactly but it's a delicacy
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1299280,1304720,here i mean people really appreciate it  it's usually reserved for the elders so  um here we go kind of like the chicken's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1304720,1310880,yawning  but then it was too big of a yawn the  game works like this whatever you can  peel off is what you eat oh gosh the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1310880,1317520,comb just came right off  it doesn't have a lot of flavor it's uh  half gooey and then half like a jerky it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1317520,1322559,kind of reminds me of some kind of asian  bar food or drinking food the eye just  looks like a sliced black olive so my
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1322559,1328960,brain's confused because i love black  olives actually i'll probably like this  too  it's squishy and a little sandy all
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1328960,1334559,right there's a braid in here somewhere  oh i'm squeezing the brain matter out a  delicacy i kind of made that up but
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1334559,1340720,there's a whole chicken but one little  brain it has to be a delicacy right now  it's called livery and fatty oily it's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1340720,1346480,kind of like coating my mouth in a fatty  chicken sensation that is it that is  nine different foods excellent the feast
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1346480,1352799,is complete bellies are full now it's  time for entertainment  [Music]

LYfVK0OjbBQ,1390640,1396000,wikipedia entry there's just direct  one-on-one experience observing what's  happening and asking as many questions
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1396000,1401039,as we can for sure these are some of the  most unique people i've ever hung out  with hour by hour i saw things i'd never
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1401039,1406400,seen before and it was an absolute joy  the level of cooking really blew me away  in dishes that i'd seen in other parts
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1406400,1412559,of the world that i didn't expect to see  here i had an incredible time and i hope  you guys got to learn something too i  want to point out one thing over here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1412559,1417080,and over here these are the fly  wranglers
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1419600,1425760,now we're heading westward to mount  kilimanjaro but what many tourists may  miss on their way to this legendary peak
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1425760,1432559,is one of this country's most unique  tribes meet the chaga people gina  languni sunny
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1432559,1440559,gina languni sunny do you think she  speaks swahili or maybe i don't speak  swahili  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1440559,1446400,around the base of africa's tallest peak  you'll find members of the chaga tribe  who have seamlessly adapted to life on
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1446400,1452400,the mountain side they don't have room  for a huge pen or a huge pasture and so  they've had to literally build a pen
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1452400,1459440,here out of wood today i'm on a mission  to show you a new version of paradise  this looks glorious a place of strong
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1459440,1465679,independent survivalists who make life  in the jungle look easy look at this  bountiful harvest the food they eat just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1465679,1472080,a little yeah just a little bit of raw  blood the booze they drink this is made  from fermented bananas it's something  like you've never seen before if you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1472080,1482000,don't like goat you will not like this  and it all starts here  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1482000,1488000,right now we're at the base of mount  kilimanjaro the tallest mountain in all  of africa  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1488000,1494080,this dormant volcano towers nineteen  thousand feet with five different  climate zones from the icy top to the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1494080,1500240,lush jungle at the mountain base we are  deep in the jungle right now it's almost  time for breakfast we need to go pick
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1500240,1507039,one ingredient before we can eat  [Music]  this is the home of the chaga people the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1507039,1513200,third largest ethnic group in tanzania  renowned for their prowess in  agriculture and their effective use this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1513200,1518880,one this right here  of bananas  oh meet tedeos he's invited me to his
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1518880,1525279,mountainside home to experience and  share the culture of his people but it's  way up there what's the plan
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1525279,1531360,today is doesn't get the bananas he  brings the bananas to him oh he's doing  the old poking technique whacking the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1531360,1537600,tree in half and collecting the goods  yes we got some bananas
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1537840,1543919,unlike other plants bananas can only  produce one fruit per stock so it's  important to cut down old stocks for the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1543919,1550480,new ones to grow our brave gatherer over  here has produced a whole what do you  call a bunch of bananas oh a bunch we
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1550480,1557840,have a whole bunch of bananas right here  so we're gonna pack this up head back to  the house and get breakfast started  let's do it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1559180,1565600,[Music]  on the way back there's one more
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1565600,1572400,ingredient needed for breakfast local  wild yams this is what i want oh that's  a tiny little yam another staple of the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1572400,1578640,chaga diet  here we have the bananas we've just  brought them back she's peeling it now
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1578640,1585360,and it is hard to peel off but you can  hear it's very tough and coarse as she  breaks it this is hard like a tuber let
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1585360,1590960,me see if i can crack it in half  yeah it just snaps in half there's  nothing soft about it and even on the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1590960,1597039,inside it looks pretty different from  other bananas i've seen before and with  this kind of hard constitution they boil
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1597039,1604480,it and then they make a banana soup that  is going to be our breakfast soon if i  didn't ruin it  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1604480,1611279,good morning thank you for joining me  today we're at your home right now this  place i'm looking around it's like  paradise do you feel that way ah no if
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1611279,1617039,you take me to your place maybe i can  feel the same thing so well i don't know  because if you go to my home state right
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1617039,1622080,now in minnesota you'll see about 30  centimeters of snow and you'll be  freezing your ass off does that sound
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1622080,1627360,like paradise maybe it would be my  paradise can you tell me what we're  going to be eating for breakfast today
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1627360,1632400,now we're just going to eat some kind of  food called the itori in swahili in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1632400,1638720,tori  yeah  dory or banana beef stew is a famous  tanzanian dish that comes originally
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1638720,1643919,from the kilimanjaro region  here they make it from bananas and yams
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1643919,1650720,i've heard of bananas for breakfast but  next these starches are topped with  boiled beef then another layer of banana
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1650720,1657679,yam some salt and water seal it with a  banana leaf and let it steam for 30  minutes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1657679,1663440,after it's cooked through add cooking  oil and water  mash it until it becomes one thick
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1663440,1669600,sticky paste and finish it off with beef  stock right i'm going to try just the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1669600,1675039,porridge part first without the beef  oh wow it doesn't taste like banana at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1675039,1680640,all it's just really starchy almost like  eating a potato so it's really thick and  quite delicious that's awesome and then
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1680640,1685679,there's some beef here  [Music]  a little tendon in there too
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1685679,1691200,careful  i just came here from meeting with the  zigua tribe
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1691200,1696320,and so they are very agricultural but  not pastoral at all and so they don't  really have any animals except for
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1696320,1702880,chickens when i asked why it was simply  because they didn't have the knowledge  about what to do with those animals and  how to raise them but here you have like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1702880,1708080,every farm animal i could imagine  where'd you learn all this we're just  heritaging this kind of lifestyle from
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1708080,1714240,our grandparents so you just grew up  like this  because even the maasai people they do  have livestock but they have to handle
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1714240,1721039,it in a very different way than you  because you're on the mountain here the  problem is we don't have enough spaces  where we can dress them free we call it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1721039,1727760,zero grazing system so we just tie them  inside and we just went outside looking  for different grasses and then we just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1727760,1733760,bring something back yeah to them so  it's like that  this is a fantastic start today we're
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1733760,1739919,going to try something that's really  traditional in the village we're going  to cook an entire goat do you have a  goat picked out already i have to decide
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1739919,1746880,and how will you decide by looking the  size and how old it is but not like how  much you like them i like them all but i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1746880,1752960,must choose one that's our next step  you're gonna see uh which one gives you  the side eye which is the meanest  looking one and we'll pull it out all
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1752960,1765759,right all right  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1769440,1775039,the goat is dispatched quickly the blood  is drained then the skin is carefully  removed
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1775039,1781200,the organs and innards are extracted and  laid out on a banana leaf the goat  itself is propped up on a wood rod and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1781200,1788240,moved to the roasting pit  right now we have the whole goat splayed
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1788240,1793440,out on a spit here the first step here  is they're taking the appendages they're  using leaves to actually tie them closer
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1793440,1799600,to the body they're too far away they're  going to get close to the fire they're  going to burn and just be charred to a  crisp we don't want that more or less we
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1799600,1805440,want everything to cook evenly so  they're going to get the legs tied up  and then from there it's just going to  rotate until it's all the way cooked
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1805440,1810559,through what's really unique about this  style is you don't usually see roasting  done this way usually the head would be
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1810559,1815840,taken clean off even the legs and the  hooves would be cut off but here this is  their traditional way of presenting it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1815840,1822640,even the ball sack is still there they  skin the whole animal except for
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1822640,1828799,i'm not sure if we eat the sack we'll  see you soon to add flavor a simple  combination of salt and lemon juice now
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1828799,1835600,the painful part basting the goat and  rotating every few minutes so it cooks  through evenly this process can take up
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1835600,1843200,to three hours  so while the goat is cooking i want to  give you a little bit of a house tour
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1843200,1848640,around this mountain you won't find a  traditional centralized village he has a  complex of a few different houses
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1848640,1854720,because a few different people live here  instead each separate household lives  emits its own banana garden bananas are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1854720,1860799,an essential crop here from daily  cooking to making an assortment of  beverages or selling them for extra cash
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1860799,1867279,and then he's got tons and tons of  animals besides fruits the banana stalks  allow chaga people to raise a variety of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1867279,1873760,animals even without grazing lands in  here a couple of cows and this is where  he's feeding them the banana tree so the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1873760,1879600,tree is soft it's supple you can  actually flash it up quite easily and  put it in here in this wooden trough and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1879600,1886399,they just they eat  despite its simple exterior inside this  animal house you'll find a whole zoo and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1886399,1891600,here are the calves eating the same  thing they have rabbits and they have  little baby rabbits over here it's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1891600,1898080,freaking adorable but don't get too  attached because these animals are not  pets they're food and dogs the dogs are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1898080,1903440,not pets they're also not food these are  alarm dogs and that's not all and here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1903440,1909919,even more animals you may recall they  also have goats unfortunately there is  one less goat here now but he's still
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1909919,1916320,got like eight nine ten goats part of  sustaining animals and crops here the  rich volcanic soil beneath our feet
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1916320,1922720,second is the knowledge accumulated and  passed down through generations this is  a very specific geography and climate
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1922720,1928720,which requires a very specific way of  life what's so unique about this area is  that it's built on a mountaintop they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1928720,1934960,don't have room for a huge pen or a huge  pasture and so they've had to literally  build a pen here out of wood and this is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1934960,1940000,where they hang out all day they've got  their food here what else do you need
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1940000,1946320,while i was touring his home tedeos was  making use of the goat's prized organs  to create a local favorite the goat's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1946320,1953120,innards are boiled with salt to create a  potent broth before eating you must add  one more ingredient you won't find at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1953120,1959360,any restaurant tadeos yes i'm here the  preparations are underway for the goat  goats on the fire but here we're about
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1959360,1964559,to try something i've never seen before  i mean i've tried a lot of blood dishes  but nothing like what you're about to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1964559,1972159,show me now can you just tell me how  this works  so the size of this we are just a little
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1972159,1977200,not not much yeah it's just a little bit  of roblox just a little of this  still a decent amount so now we are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1977200,1984159,going to pack the soup we call it white  soup right it's like a white milky broth  combining all the organs and the fats so
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1984159,1991120,that gets dumped into the blood and that  is steaming hot like boiling you can see  how changing very very slowly from red
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1991120,1996960,to brown when they change that means  they're ready to be consumed so you  don't eat raw blood ever no all right
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1996960,1999360,let's try it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2002159,2007760,that is potent it reminds me of many  dishes i've had in asia like a far broth  something that's just very deep in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2007760,2014480,flavor it's really incredible  because of its concentrated amounts of  salt and minerals you can most often
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2014480,2019760,find locals eating this dish on a sunday  morning when they have a hangover right  now he's got some stomach over here he's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2019760,2025519,gonna slice that into little bitty  pieces oh you put it in the soup all  right let's try it out
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2025760,2032159,oh man it's a really good texture that's  pretty good stomach stomach is tough for  me because some people are really good  at making stomach some people they're
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2032159,2037518,not and when they're not it can get  really bad this is quite delicious
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2037919,2043200,even when you were younger is this the  way you would prepare a goat the head is  there the legs are there so we do that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2043200,2049040,in example in special events when is the  last time you did it this way one year  ago so really for special occasions very
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2049040,2054079,very very special why do you keep the  head and why do you keep the whole body  together for example if i want to give
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2054079,2061440,somebody price i need him to see  everything now you see that is a god  because you can see the evidence
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2061440,2066638,heart kidney stomach lungs this soup  contains almost all of the goat's organs
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2066638,2072560,except for one the goat liver  that was saved for the fire then they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2072560,2079040,wrap it with coal fat and grill it until  the fat melts creating an epic flavor  shell we've had roasted liver before and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2079040,2085760,in many places here in africa even in  egypt it's very common that they cook  the liver straight away what makes this  especially unique though is that they've
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2085760,2092398,wrapped the liver in coal fat a big thin  membrane of fat that is kind of usually  wrapped around all the organs and stuff
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2092398,2098079,oh thank you all right so we all got a  piece cheers  oh wow right away there's a strong hint
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2098079,2103200,of goatiness i love goat but if you  don't like goat you will not like this  but then just beyond that sometimes when
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2103200,2109680,you eat liver that's not been prepared  very well it can like dry your mouth  while you're eating it but not this this  it's moist already plus they wrap the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2109680,2114880,fat around it too so it's kind of juicy  and fatty at the same time
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2115280,2122720,delicious i love it  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2122720,2128078,while the goat continues to roast we're  heading to the local market
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2129040,2135920,so it turns out we have almost  everything we need except for a few  ingredients so we're headed to the  market right now to buy some vegetables
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2135920,2143520,and a few other things  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2143520,2148880,my men yes man so we have a meat we have  a lot of meat there's one more dish you  want to make though with vegetables
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2148880,2154800,right what's that called kitalolo  quitololo yeah yeah i feel like i'm in  jamaica again what do we need from here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2154800,2160640,from here we need vegetables some  carrots yeah we need also some tomatoes  does it look like roma tomatoes do we
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2160640,2166000,have everything uh i think  i'm surprised that you need to go to a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2166000,2171760,market at all because you're such a  renaissance man you have everything at  your house so when you do need to buy  something what kind of stuff are you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2171760,2177359,usually buying for the market we must  buy sugar salt cooking oil some stuff  like that you can't even make your own
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2177359,2183599,cooking oil no way not yet no because we  have a good infrastructure i mean the  road yeah we can get everything straight
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2183599,2189200,here but before it was very very  difficult how long have you had a paved  road like this not more than five years
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2189200,2195680,i think wow yes but this area still  doesn't have electricity do they only  one year that is very very new wow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2195680,2203078,that's wild  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2203359,2208800,all right so preparation is underway  it's a long bit of preparation for today  the goat is taking much longer than i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2208800,2214000,thought it's now on our four maybe there  may be nothing left by the time it's  done roasting it'll just be a snack like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2214000,2220400,a crouton  right here can i see this she's just  broken open a nut i've never seen this  kind of nut before
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2220400,2226800,this is an oyster nut also known as a  queen's nut they come from berries that  can weigh up to 30 pounds they can be
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2226800,2233119,used to create nut oil or they can be  eaten raw oh as an added benefit they're  absolutely delicious i don't know what
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2233119,2238160,that is but really good it reminds me of  a brazil nut but it's flat something  between a brazil nut and like a water
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2238160,2244560,chestnut really good  so she's grating nuts and she's kind of  grating the leafy greens and look at the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2244560,2251599,way she does it it's incredible because  she just does everything by hand there's  no cutting board they just take the food  by hand usually stand over a bucket or a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2251599,2257119,bowl and they do it in their hand  here they have a very unique dish that  i'm very excited about because i'm
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2257119,2262560,hoping it's going to defy expectations  once again this soup is called matcha  lari a traditional dish from the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2262560,2269440,kilimanjaro region usually it's made  from bananas and beef but today they'll  swap that for goat organs and intestines
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2269440,2275760,boiled with bananas onions garlic  carrots and tomatoes until it all  becomes a mouth-watering stew all right
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2275760,2282160,so here i got some of the broth i have a  big piece of banana let's try it out  wow super savory little bit gaming
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2282160,2288160,slightly goaty broth the banana is  almost like a cassava just super starchy  very potatoey and then they have
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2288160,2294400,intestines liver fats heart lungs i  think i should share would you be  interested in some of this delicious
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2294400,2300160,soup  try it out i want to see what they go  for oh she see she's going for the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2300160,2305599,banana and she's going for i don't know  that's like the crotch muscle i'm not  sure what that is let's see what she
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2305599,2311520,thinks  [Music]  tomosana very delicious all right i've
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2311520,2317200,got my big old intestine right here  let's try it out  it's been boiling for a very long time
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2317200,2322960,so it's not like that usual kind of  squiddy toughness or chewiness it was  kind of soft and almost milky that's a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2322960,2329119,unique intestinal experience that's  pretty good all right so this is kind of  our appetizer i don't know how many  appetizers i've had today this is just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2329119,2335440,basically holding us over until that  goat gets dehydrated down to a crisp so  i'm very curious how that's gonna taste
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2335440,2341119,i'm gonna find out very soon  moment has finally come they've taken
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2341119,2348240,the goat off of the spit we need to take  it to the eating area but look at this  thing this looks glorious a whole goat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2348240,2355560,head feet everything right now headed to  the dinner table let's go
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2360960,2366880,we've climbed the mountain we've come up  here they've got the goat they're  putting it on the table and this part is  a little bit dangerous because these
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2366880,2373280,legs are well done oh they're breaking  off okay that's okay everything's okay  all right they're removing the wire from
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2373280,2379359,the tail and from the legs that was kind  of holding it on to the wood and then  now oh it's gonna be such a relief for
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2379359,2385839,the goat finally having that pulled out  of its ass from here they're just gonna  orient it a little bit differently we're  gonna add some more food some beer made
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2385839,2391680,from bananas all that coming together  and then it's time to eat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2393760,2399839,to join us in eating this entire goat  tadeos has invited more members of his  family oh i'm so excited the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2399839,2406240,presentation is incredible it's just a  whole goat there's no question i look at  this and i'm not like is that a kangaroo
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2406240,2412640,is that a giraffe no i know for sure  it's a goat and why why because of the  head yeah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2412640,2418640,so we have this we have some vegetables  we have some banana beer which i'm very  excited about shall we eat yeah now this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2418640,2424240,is roasted a little differently than any  goat i've seen before because it was not  basted they maybe put some lemon on it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2424240,2430640,in the beginning but there was nothing  to kind of keep moisture inside and i'm  wondering if it's going to be dry what's  it going to be like oh that's a big
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2430640,2436880,piece let's go for it  that goat is delicious i thought it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2436880,2442160,would be really dried out because it  shrunk by half the size while it was  roasting it's really just a little bit
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2442160,2449359,crispy on the outside and then really  soft and juicy and just full of goatee  flavor mmm tamu
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2449359,2454560,almosana really yummy  all right right here we have a piece of  the neck meat you know some places
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2454560,2459599,around the world if you're eating sheep  neck it's actually a delicacy we had  something like that in iran and you can
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2459599,2466400,see why this is so soft let's try it out  [Music]  that protein juiciness so good
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2466400,2473520,that's delicious and i want to keep  eating that forever but here we have a  vegetable too what is this this dish is  known as kita lolo it starts with naofu
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2473520,2480160,and kilodermal the chopped local greens  we saw earlier  [Music]  add sliced bananas and grated oyster
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2480160,2486560,nuts then it gets a little bit funky  they mix soda ash with water and pour it  in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2486560,2491599,cook it until everything softens up  and finish with sour milk that's been
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2491599,2497529,fermenting for two to three days  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2497680,2504640,all right i'm gonna try it out  i can feel the grated nuts i taste the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2504640,2510720,greens it's a little spinachy but like a  little bitter and then there's just a  hint of sourness from the milk but it's  not off-putting and it doesn't feel
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2510720,2516160,especially dairy-like it just feels like  something in here is a bit fermented  that is because of that sour milk wow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2516160,2521520,does this milk come from your cows and  you keep it in a container until it  turns sour
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2521520,2525599,how many days does the milk form two to  three days
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2526960,2531838,last thing beer made from bananas  bananas
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2533440,2539520,this beer is called mega it's a common  beverage among chaga people overripe  bananas are peeled and tossed in a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2539520,2545920,hollow log  then crushed with dry grass to squeeze
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2545920,2552720,out and filter the juice inside  the banana juice is mixed with millet
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2552720,2559200,flour then left to ferment for just a  few days after that you have a drink  that is super calorie dense plus it'll
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2559200,2565040,get you drunk all right oh you know i  went uh oh easy  he said that you have to test it oh i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2565040,2572999,taste it first  oh i couldn't here i go  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2578880,2585040,that's good  tom usana  oh yeah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2585040,2590720,there you go  your turn  wow it's interesting there's a little  banana pulp in there it does taste a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2590720,2597119,little bananay but sour and fermented  it's about as strong as regular beer  maybe like seven percent alcohol will
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2597119,2603680,this get me drunk sure yeah i love being  drunk  [Music]  you are 45 down you've lived here your
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2603680,2609520,whole life you've seen this place change  a lot added infrastructure roads  electricity for you what's your focus
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2609520,2614960,yeah i'm still have the young kids here  i want to build their future so i'm just  concentrating to make sure that they are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2614960,2620240,going to school well and they're just  studying well so that at the end they're  going to have their own better life when
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2620240,2627359,you say you want them to have a better  life how do you want it to be different  from yours for example in the village it  is not that easy to have your own car
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2627359,2633760,but if they get good education and good  job they can buy their own so is it more  about money or more about just catching
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2633760,2639920,up to the modern times as tanzania is  becoming more and more developed know  about money if you have money you can do
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2639920,2645760,anything you want to do but if you don't  have money  tedeos yes you're an incredible dude
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2645760,2651550,thank you thank you so much you're  welcome  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2651680,2657200,we're heading away from kilimanjaro  toward the serengeti on a mission to  discover the most unique out of this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2657200,2663838,world market you'll find in africa this  place is insane
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2664800,2670560,meet the messiah the masai number over  two million mostly in kenya and tanzania
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2670560,2675680,so they keep it in the gourd i guess it  can stay fresh in there a long time for  hundreds of years members of this tribe
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2675680,2680880,ate nothing but meat milk and blood they  have one of the most mesmerizing diets
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2680880,2686240,you'll find anywhere there's something  that is going to appear controversial to  the people who watch what follows and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2686240,2693680,that is the way the sheep is dispatched  it's dispatched by by by way of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2693680,2700319,today i'm saying yes shares whatever i  see whatever they offer that's ahead no  matter how extreme
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2700319,2710319,it all starts no i got i got it here  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2710319,2716319,the massage nomadic lifestyle revolves  around their cattle where they move  depends fully on where there's grazing
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2716319,2722319,land when the animals aren't grazing  traditionally they're kept in a pasture  surrounded by houses so they can protect
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2722319,2728560,their cattle from predators like lions  these days at least in this village the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2728560,2734319,setup is a little different as some  tribes begin to align themselves with  modern day tanzania they have decided to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2734319,2740000,move kettles and animals aside because  before they are getting a lot of  problems for the kids they are seeking
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2740000,2746160,here they've adopted the local currency  as they've learned to do business with  other tribes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2746160,2752000,isn't just about trading cows but about  buying and selling any number of  products products we'll soon see at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2752000,2758079,africa's biggest massage market  all right sir  how are you doing i don't know across
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2758079,2764000,from me tobiko the village chief next to  him adam our expedition leader we're  here we're in your village we're about
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2764000,2769119,to have some breakfast together so we  have these vessels for food although  they're empty and i believe the food is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2769119,2775359,currently residing in that gourd so  we're going to have la soro  [Music]  all right it gives a little bit of a mix
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2775359,2781359,you want to mix the corn and the milk  corn and sour milk this is what many  masai in this area eat for breakfast it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2781359,2787079,looks like yogurt  it's got protein i heard the word  protein
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2788000,2792960,corn kernels are separated from the car  before boiling
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2793920,2800240,now the corn part of this makes me  really curious because i've hung out  with the maasai people in kenya and  traditionally is told that the maasai
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2800240,2806000,people are nomads and they eat three  things blood  milk and meat and so i'm wondering was
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2806000,2813839,corn introduced later on when he was  young that's when he get introduced to  the corn  in a clay pot add corn sour cow milk and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2813839,2821280,mix  does this come from your cows yes they  come from these cows that mixture goes  into a calabash containing ash according
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2821280,2826720,to them the ash makes the food taste a  whole lot better  so they keep it in the gourd i guess it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2826720,2832318,can stay fresh in there a long time you  can stay there for a month a month oh  that's awesome cheers
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2833599,2839200,okay that's really interesting it's so  rich calorie dense this whole thing is  probably 800 calories
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2839200,2844240,it's a lot of vitamins so it tastes like  a very liquidy yogurt and then the corn  the corn reminds me of corn i've had in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2844240,2850000,mexico where it's kind of rubbery  starchy certainly not sweet at all but
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2850160,2856400,sorry still chewing it's so rich it adds  some starch it adds some texture and  even more calories to the dish so you're  not just getting milk how often do you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2856400,2862000,eat something like this  three times a day oh wow the corn in  africa is very interesting to me in most
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2862000,2867440,ways it's good because it's offered this  very affordable means for people to get  calories efficiently and inexpensively
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2867440,2872640,but it has disrupted the traditional  diets of  many many tribes all over the country
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2872640,2878240,when i go hang out with the himba people  they also are suddenly eating corn flour  and when i hang out here i see also
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2878240,2884559,you've incorporated corn largely into  your diet so if money was no object if  you had to choose just to do the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2884559,2889920,traditional style milk blood meat would  he prefer that over corn
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2891640,2898400,[Music]  if you drink only milk you feel hungry  fast so when you incorporate to a corn
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2898400,2903920,you stay for a long time so even if we  have a lot of cows a lot of animals he  will still
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2903920,2911280,prefer to have the corn first of all the  breakfast wonderful thank you we've come  here today to experience eating some
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2911280,2918559,sheep the masai way  there's something that is going to  appear controversial to the people who  watch what follows that is the way the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2918559,2925359,sheep is dispatched by way of  strangulation i guess you could say  cutting off its airway
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2925599,2931760,tradition has it and when sacrificing an  animal the men will walk it outside the  village to slaughter and cook
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2931760,2937078,later bringing back dedicated cuts for  the women
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2937680,2940809,[Applause]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2943550,2948720,[Music]  you know out here you probably just have  the two options strangulation or slicing
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2948720,2954480,the throat do you think one of those is  more humane or easier for the animal  than the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2955040,2960800,suffocating other much better for the  animal because they die fast you think  that like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2960800,2966559,withholding air is actually going to be  faster than waiting for it to bleed out  yeah suffocating is faster but also the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2966559,2971750,animal do not suffer from cut i never  thought about it that way
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2971750,2977680,[Music]  i've always opted to document the way  cultures around the world slaughter
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2977680,2984640,animals because these actions tell their  own story  here in this village they cut off the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2984640,2990000,goat's airways until the animal  suffocates and dies  they do this to keep the soon to be
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2990000,2998790,eaten blood inside the animals  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2999200,3004480,they've just skinned the entire animal  the blood since it's not been released  it's completely pooled within the animal
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3004480,3009599,and if my last experience with the  messiah in kenya is any indicator  i think i know what's going to come next
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3009599,3014880,they're slaughtering it in a way i've  never seen before because i mean almost  always you see people skin it and then
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3014880,3020319,gut it but they're kind of working  around all the organs  the other side of the ribs there is a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3020319,3025760,pool of blood remaining  oh boy oh  wow he'd
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3025760,3031359,you just never get used to it oh he  slurped it up like it was jello all  right hold on save some for the rest of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3031359,3037440,us  oh my god okay let's go for it you got  to be quick here oh god it's still you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3037440,3042480,can feel the warmth of the animal just  like that huh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3042480,3047480,god damn it  no i caught it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3055150,3061440,[Applause]  it's salty  it's irony it tastes like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3061440,3067200,raw blood my instinct is to kick it back  and to puke it up  i will not let that happen
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3067200,3075359,okay it's all ptsd now they've taken the  kidney here they cut the kidney in half  he puts that in my hand okay fantastic
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3075839,3079720,okay piece of raw kidney
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3088480,3094400,yeah yeah you eat that you know what the  breakfast was actually pretty nice  this guy he is taking it down like a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3094400,3099839,champion like a warrior  i can't do it i want a pop-tart i want a  toaster strudel i want pretty much
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3099839,3105760,anything but this right now  i'm not sure why just some people get  the blood and others don't but man that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3105760,3111760,guy's a blood fiend huge fan so now i  believe they're gonna finish taking it  apart portioning the animal out the way
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3111760,3116960,they portion it is very important in  this tribe and in this village because  each piece is for a different person
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3116960,3123440,dependent on their sex whether they're  pregnant dependent on their age  so while that's happening
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3123440,3132480,i'm gonna go clean up  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3132480,3138000,so the meat has been roasting now for  about 30 minutes they're taking it off  everything's ready let me point out this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3138000,3143440,right here from this side you might not  be able to tell what it is that's the  head so the head they charred it they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3143440,3148960,scraped off all the hair and then now  the whole skull was split in half you  can even see the tongue in the very
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3148960,3154800,center i can't believe the accuracy with  which they've been able to split it open  carefully and roast the whole thing all
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3154800,3163559,the way through  [Music]  boom okay here we go please
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3166480,3173040,it looks like we're going to be trying  out one piece at a time right here is  either the front or back leg and  everything's shared in a very communal
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3173040,3178720,style it's like brazilian barbecue  oh thank you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3179040,3184240,super juicy very delicious you must  understand no seasonings nothing has  been added it's also one of the fastest
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3184240,3189839,preparations i've ever seen in my life  from the dispatching of the goat until  eating right now is probably an hour or
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3189839,3195040,less super quick and efficient it makes  sense because back in the day if you're  eating this constantly for your main
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3195040,3201839,source of protein or your main source of  calories period you would have to be  able to do it quickly some of these  pieces are a bit more medium not cooked
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3201839,3207119,all the way through something tells me  they don't mind that good  yeah  there's going to be nothing left of this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3207119,3212640,animal when we're done  in just a matter of minutes this whole  leg is just gone
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3212640,3218319,now this is something i've never tried  with the messiah i've tried the ribs  i've tried legs but the head oh thank
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3218319,3223359,you that is a lower jaw not a lot of  meat but right back here i just saw the  cheese
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3223359,3228520,super tender super delicious  all right so he's smacking the jaw right  now  what
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3228520,3234079,[Music]  i didn't even know this cut of meat  existed please
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3234240,3240400,he just cracked open the jaw and out  comes  whatever that is oh it looks like a  noodle
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3240400,3246480,it's good  this is part of the efficiency i'm  talking about they can't waste anything  i mean why would they want to cutting
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3246480,3254079,off the tongue this has to be one of the  most prized bites of the entire sheep  oh is this for me what
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3254079,3261440,big fatty beautiful i'm gonna try to  just take one slice i feel bad i wanna  share it i'm gonna keep this one here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3261440,3267920,please yeah good good i think i did the  right move everyone's sharing it they're  loving it take a look at this you can  see the fat from the base of the tongue
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3267920,3273680,inside the tongue it is juicy really  meaty and then there's kind of like the  bark that's built up from roasting over
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3273680,3279839,the fire here  [Music]  so chief i do have a few questions  because i know these days the cattle are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3279839,3286079,not just for your personal consumption  you're eating some like today but you're  also selling them at the market so how  do you decide what to eat and how you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3286079,3292400,decide what to sell  i'm buying them  so the one that looks very healthy the  one that they are eating the one that's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3292400,3299520,not very healthy that is for sale all  right don't worry i won't share your  secrets with anybody especially at the  market where we're going next
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3299520,3308720,[Music]  a few miles later and we've arrived at  tanzania's isolated masai trading market
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3308720,3317119,a place with its own out of this world  goat alley this is where folks come to  eat and we're gonna see that soon
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3317520,3322640,this place has been around since 1954.  even before tanzania gained independence
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3322640,3328559,once a week this plot of dusty land  becomes a colorful hot spot packed with  action
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3328559,3334799,each friday chief tobiko and his nephew  gideon bring their livestock here to  sell we've come to low key market this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3334799,3340640,is one of the wildest most unique  markets i've seen anywhere in the world  and i've been to a good amount of places
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3340640,3345760,here they have not only food but they  have livestock they have everyday  commodities anything people would need
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3345760,3351599,for day-to-day life so i'm going to show  you everything i can find food and  otherwise first to the livestock area
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3351599,3355920,let's move  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3357200,3363040,back in the day this place was only  populated by local messiah but over the  years other tribes from neighboring
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3363040,3369359,regions have begun trickling in all  right this is pretty wild the foundation  of this market starts with the livestock
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3369359,3374720,and no protein is consumed more in  messiah life than goats there's a bunch  of different goats too look at this one
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3374720,3378000,with the butt with the dumbbell
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3381359,3385519,i don't think he liked that very much  thank you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3386880,3393280,i think i'm in  in these parts cattle are wealth and a  form of currency the more cattle you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3393280,3398960,have the wealthier you are if you have  no cattle you're probably broke if  you're here if you're selling goats
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3398960,3405440,what's a good price you would hope to  get for a goat sabine some money so 60  000 up to 100 000 depend on the size of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3405440,3411520,the guard okay that's pretty affordable  they're also selling cows i want to see  the cow area
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3411920,3419599,just outside the goat pet you'll find an  open patch with folks selling cows to  the highest bidder 350
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3419599,3426160,this man walked all the way here with  three cows it's late in the afternoon  and he's still yet to sell a single one
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3426160,3431280,the word is around town some people will  take like a sick cow or an unhealthy cow  they'll bring it to the market is this a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3431280,3437040,healthy cow  it's good  i don't know how you test such a thing  but he says the cow is in good shape
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3437040,3442240,although we do know that some people  bring the unhealthy market  wow this guy he does lack a little
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3442240,3448000,confidence in negotiating because i'm  not negotiating at all and he's already  dropping the price rule one uh don't do  that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3448000,3453440,thank you very much  we're continuing on in the market here  is where they have all the produce and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3453440,3460079,this is stuff that's going to be local  to tanzania and the area in general so  there's tomatoes onions corn lots of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3460079,3466720,different brightly colored foods and  right here we just found some fried  bread too  with livestock as a market staple over
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3466720,3473440,time local farmers began bringing and  selling produce of all kinds but when  people gather especially over a long hot
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3473440,3478880,day they need to eat  this next place is insane i call it goat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3478880,3486799,alley right now you can see as we're  walking in slaughtering goats on this  side slaughtering goats jumbo jumbo
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3486799,3493119,that meal we had already today you're  going to see the same kind of iteration  all over the place because that's what  people prepare here and that's what they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3493119,3499119,eat here i mean look at this  the staple food like really the food the  messiah are known for and there's just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3499119,3504880,dozens of places serving this here it's  wild to see this thing that's really  based on village life on small
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3504880,3512400,communities they have kind of  commercialized it here and so people can  come they can get the goat like they're  used to eating at home
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3512400,3515400,incredible
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3518319,3524000,at the end of goat alley just a few  steps away you'll find this place guys  we've made our way to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3524000,3530000,a bar this will not surprise you if you  know me that's where people come hang  out and get drunk like if i was maasai
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3530000,3535040,this is probably where you'd find me  every friday  hub owner miss prisca owns more than one
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3535040,3542640,of these happy houses right here in this  bucket there's a corn beer and then it's  poured in a huge cup
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3542640,3548559,i look like a little kid at a football  game i've got like my big drink a big  plate of food like i'm ready to roar at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3548559,3554640,the picnic here  it's not fun to drink alone i'm gonna  hand out some beers to these guys too  asante guys cheers i don't know if
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3554640,3561359,people cheers here but cheers  wow that is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3561440,3567520,it's milky it's fermented for sure it's  thick it's like getting drunk off of  milk just imagine a bunch of corn that's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3567520,3573599,been sitting in a pile in a wet sheet  for a week that's what it smells and  tastes like and i can see why people  would want to be in here and hang out in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3573599,3580079,here because it is scorching outside  it's nearly 90 degrees it's nothing but  heat and then dirt beneath you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3580079,3586480,drinking is easy but if you want to eat  it's byop bring your own plate just a  few steps away you'll find one of the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3586480,3592799,few food options here that isn't grilled  goat  pilau  a blended rice with chopped goat and a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3592799,3598559,load of spices kidney beans tomato and  onion salad and finally goat stew look i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3598559,3603680,didn't say it wouldn't be goat i just  said it wouldn't be grilled goat oh  super yummy beans and rice it's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3603680,3609839,delicious it's about what you would  expect this is a very balanced plate so  i'm gonna get that all in one spoonful
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3609839,3616559,yummy tender goat it's a little bit  different i mean it's been stewed as  opposed to being roasted i gotta say the  average person from my hometown if you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3616559,3623119,gave them this plate they would love it  but if you put them in this setting it  would blow their head off they would be  so overwhelmed by all the stimulation
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3623119,3629520,that there is here there's hanging  animals everywhere and just the complete  circle of life is here so that is what  people might have some trouble with but
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3629520,3634880,the food itself is delicious it's really  good oh i'm feeling the corn beer a  little bit i got a little bit of a buzz
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3634880,3640160,i like it  this is excellent bar food and this  whole plate get this cost
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3640160,3646319,one dollar for all this rice meat  vegetables it has everything this i  think you could probably get about five  of these for a dollar for two dollars
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3646319,3651280,you can get a good buzz and a full  stomach  i like it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3653920,3660000,motorcycle tire sandals seem to be a  massage innovation i also saw them in  kenya first of all you can get shoes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3660000,3665599,from here shoes that are already made  but these are called zero kilometer  shoes that means these are new-ish tires
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3665599,3672880,the special thing they do here is they  customize them and they fit them to your  feet exactly  that's one potential shoe and i don't
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3672880,3678079,know i need to find a matching tread it  doesn't say the size of the tire on here  all right i gotta look around
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3678079,3683119,this is pretty good am i gonna be  walking uh in circles if i get the wrong  tread it doesn't match i think right
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3683119,3689839,here is pretty good they're not exactly  the same width but they're close enough  i'm gonna try walking around in these  let's see how it goes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3689839,3695040,first of all these are my actual shoes  i've been putting off shoe shopping for  a long time my real shoes look like crap
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3695040,3703280,time for some new ones this is how  they're made using a knife a hammer a  few nails and a lot of craftsmanship
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3703280,3708319,this shuster is cobbling together custom  footwear made from abandoned tires he
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3708319,3713520,claims they'll last for two years this  seems like a deal i cannot pass up
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3713520,3720079,my gosh you've done it well done look at  this i got new shoes made from  motorcycle tires so that is pretty
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3720079,3726559,incredible  i got my new shoes let's take a stroll

LYfVK0OjbBQ,3732960,3740039,too narrow and it's killing my foot now  whose fault is that that's mine i picked  the tires
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3740799,3746160,aside from the shoe making  you'll find a lot of standout services  here that you won't find at your usual

LYfVK0OjbBQ,3855520,3861039,as i go around the market i notice  there's not a huge amount of variety but  they have more goat parts that i haven't
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3861039,3867039,tried yet including  this do you have any idea what this is  take a close look it's wrinkly yeah

LYfVK0OjbBQ,3877760,3884000,all the way through i hope these balls  are not medium rare because that is  definitely not something i would order  okay so from here he's taking the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3884000,3889520,testicles off he's going to slice them  up i'm going to try it out  aside from these tasty gonads my final
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3889520,3895280,meal includes hacked up pieces of goat  back  and bananas simply slit it down the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3895280,3900319,middle and let it fry  the day here is winding down the sun's  going to set in a couple of hours and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3900319,3905359,that means everyone is going to be out  of here but right now even more food  that i found and also i found these two
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3905359,3910720,guys from the village hey how you doing  i lost him for a little bit  earlier i was competing to win a warm
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3910720,3916319,coca-cola i don't know why i'd be doing  that when i could just buy a warm beer  ah somewhat refreshing intoxicating
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3916319,3923520,though  here let's take a tour of the platter  this is kind of the lower back of the  goat fried bananas and then the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3923520,3931599,testicles something that gives men like  us power not that we need it  but couldn't hurt to get a little help
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3931839,3938720,i'm going to try ooh would i try first  nice little pieces of meat  now here they have their own salsa a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3938720,3944960,chili sauce if you want  salty but a little bit of spice like a  three out of ten not bad
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3944960,3950799,fried bananas the perfect pairing to all  this heavy food let's go for it  bit starchy obviously not sweet it came
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3950799,3958720,from the green banana so it's just going  to be almost potatoey inside oh i wonder  if i'll go with that in here in the  chili sauce what that's insane
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3958720,3964000,yeah that's really good my god that is  masai chips and salsa right there that's  quite delicious all right guys well that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3964000,3970880,pretty much wraps up the show i hope you  enjoyed oh  right the balls  let's go for it together ready
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3970880,3976480,let's go for it  [Music]  he says very delicious it has a very
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3976480,3981599,gentle flavor it's soft it's palatable  it's not too intrusive it's not blunt i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3981599,3988079,like it it's a very different texture of  meat it's a weird feeling it's so hard  to explain it almost like eating a  flaky fish i don't know it doesn't make
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3988079,3994640,sense i gotta say not bad and a good way  to end the day a little bit of manpower  hormone manpower
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3994640,4001119,you know what i love about today almost  three years ago i went to kenya and i  got to experience the traditional side  that goes back decades or hundreds of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4001119,4006880,years but now in parts of africa people  are adapting to modern times and to  modern development here you can see the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4006880,4013680,messiah taking interesting rituals and  customs that usually would only take  place within their village and they're  sharing it in big communities and even
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4013680,4018880,with outsiders people who aren't messiah  people from other villages even my  stupid pace we can come here we can take
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4018880,4024000,part and enjoy this very traditional  food and sit short of the shoulder with  the messiah people at the same time the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4024000,4029039,messiah people are learning from other  tribes and other people as well so as  our world is becoming more globalized
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4029039,4035838,and more connected it's fascinating to  see the next step for the messiah people  that said cheers
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4037599,4043200,it's my last day to experience a rarely  seen and rarely tasted side of africa

LYfVK0OjbBQ,4168960,4173238,wow everyone here looks so gorgeous
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4176000,4182400,considered by some to be the oldest  tribe in tanzania occupying the northern  region around manyara with a population
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4182400,4188960,of about 30 000  their village and their houses look  different from any i've seen so far in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4188960,4194560,tanzania multi-room compound structures  built with sticks mud and manure topped
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4194560,4200400,with dirt and grass  as pastoral semi-nomads
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4200400,4206960,they depend on their cattle and their  cattle depend on them to seek out and  find fresh grazing land when one area is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4206960,4212239,depleted they pack up everything move  and start again
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4212400,4219199,with all the care they require the  cattle also give back they can be sold  or traded their skin is used to make
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4219199,4224480,clothing  and their milk is used for sustenance
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4226800,4232630,this is breakfast prepared by the women  of the tribe today as with most days  we'll go with porridge
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4232630,4238719,[Music]  corn is ground down to a fine powder  using a heavy stone
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4238719,4244320,add corn flour to hot water while  constantly mixing to avoid any lumps
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4244320,4250320,finally add fresh cow milk mix until  it's bubbling hot then served in a  handmade gourd
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4250320,4256000,i love the bowls here all the bowls are  made from gourds and then it has a  leather strap to hold on to i want to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4256000,4260610,try this out  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4261199,4267199,it's very hot i'm not going to taste  anything for days  you have to do like this to make it cool
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4267199,4272560,down i got to wait a couple minutes on  this this is a village where you grew up  yes and at what age did you leave the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4272560,4277679,village when i was 26 26 yosef was born  and raised in this datoga village
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4277679,4284080,wanting to show the world his people's  unique culture he devoted himself to  learning english and becoming a god
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4284080,4289760,today he'll be the bridge between me and  a culture i've never witnessed before i  should say that porridge is good in the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4289760,4295840,morning they used to drink so you feel  hot and also it's nice for the small  baby what about a big baby
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4295840,4301840,okay here we go  it's almost like a really hot milk with  some corn flour mixed in it's very nice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4301840,4307920,though and it really warms you up i feel  good  is this something they usually eat for  breakfast yeah every day is it just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4307920,4312960,quick yeah quick easy that makes sense  everyone likes a quick easy breakfast  even here so people can get started with
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4312960,4319679,their day i'm curious about some people  have some marks and scars around their  face how old were you when you got the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4319679,4325760,scarification here  she said i was around 15 or 16.
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4325760,4331760,everyone receives a scar on their  forehead and eyelids at birth it's  believed these scars will protect
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4331760,4337679,eyesight and prevent headaches she has a  gorgeous tattoo right here i'm a big fan  i'll try to get my wife to get a tattoo
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4337679,4343360,like that  when tribe members reach the age of 15  they can get tattoos or further
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4343360,4348640,scarification of their choosing was this  painful did that hurt
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4349360,4355450,she said this hats a lot because they  take the needle and then they cut it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4355450,4361679,[Applause]  before migrating to tanzania the  datoga's origins are believed to be in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4361679,4369239,southern sudan or the western ethiopian  highlands going back 3 000 years
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4375199,4379920,timeless tribal traits can still be  witnessed today
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4381520,4386960,their language  and especially in the way they present  themselves
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4386960,4392400,i'm curious about the way they dress  themselves up for example everyone has  like these big ear gauges
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4392400,4398480,from what age are they expanding their  ears 15 years so they make the small  hole and they make a big obvious yeah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4398480,4404640,because it takes time to stretch out oh  can i put my finger in there  okay i can fit two whole fingers in her
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4404640,4411280,ear hole that's pretty good you know she  can get three fingers she got three of  her own fingers in there
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4411280,4418239,oh she gives it a little bit of a spit  she shines it  oh  wow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4418560,4425199,very nice oh okay  oh yeah give me some time i think i can
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4425199,4431520,get there  yeah so she said no problem you just  take the knife
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4431840,4436069,i'll consider it  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4437440,4443199,women are tasked with taking care of  children cooking everyday meals making  clothes and jewelry so this is some of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4443199,4449040,the leather that they've made here oh  wow it is heavy i mean this is like four  or five pounds you will not find that at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4449040,4455120,h m maybe forever 21.  as for the men  not right now but sometimes they have
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4455120,4462080,important tasks too  like protecting the village from enemies  or building houses
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4462080,4468320,daily life centers around tending to the  cattle this is also man's work walking  with the cattle for miles in search of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4468320,4474480,grazing lands  on the occasions when they do sacrifice  an animal for consumption the men are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4474480,4479760,also tasked with dispatching  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4479760,4487360,why do they put milk in its mouth they  put the milk in the mouth to wish to  have a lot of cows in the future
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4490100,4497040,[Music]  it is essential that the animal's blood
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4497040,4503679,be kept inside  so rather than bleeding it out and  wasting precious calories they instead
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4503679,4509440,opt to suffocate the creature using  sticks and applying pressure to its  throat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4509440,4514800,the chef prays until the animal draws  its final breath
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4515120,4521760,in most tribes i've visited the work of  slicing dicing and butchering is left up  to the men but not in the case of the da
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4521760,4524760,toga
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4527840,4533440,there is no doubt that this is a messy  laborious task but that doesn't mean  it's without its purse so here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4533440,4538960,traditionally the women are the ones  handling all the butchering skinning  retrieving the blood
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4538960,4544639,what that means also is that the women  get first dibs on this blood
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4546480,4553840,looks tasty now we all know that i've  tried blood already i tried it with the  maasai people and it was outstanding
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4554400,4559679,yeah yeah you eat that right so i don't  need to do that again but this is really  the first time for me that i've seen the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4559679,4565040,women drinking raw blood i've seen it  many places with the men especially with  the messiah men but here the women
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4565040,4573039,they've got the blood all to themselves  anya  oh  i'm so full i just had lunch
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4579120,4585520,at first i just saw the blood and i  thought well i just had blood yesterday  i don't need to try it again i know what  blood is like here they're doing
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4585520,4592080,something new something i've never seen  before so they have all the organs raw  raw liver raw heart and this is the bile
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4592080,4596880,from the animal can i see that oh god  why am i doing this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4597520,4603920,this revolting green liquid is a  combination of gastric acid and bile  squeezed out from the small intestine of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4603920,4609520,the animal this is going to be mixed oh  actually she's mixed it already here she  has some blood gastric acid and there
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4609520,4614800,might be liver in there too it's hard to  say i don't really want to finger around  in there but this is kind of a delicacy
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4614800,4621600,here  oh gosh that was such a big piece  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4621600,4626120,so  give it a little bite
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4639890,4642939,[Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4647840,4650840,oh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4653840,4660560,oh where's my jack daniels the taste  it's a very unique texture you've never  had anything like it you can feel your
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4660560,4666000,teeth tearing the tissue apart slowly as  you run your mouth through it it is a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4666000,4672719,creepy interesting unique texture i've  not discovered anywhere else finish it  up let's go let's go we didn't come here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4672719,4676040,to play around
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4691120,4696320,it's the only time i've ever gagged on  this show  it's just like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4696320,4702239,drinking stomach acid yeah have a little  bit of a sip please  show me the way
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4702239,4706440,anya  oh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4708400,4713679,this is the last thing i'm gonna do i'm  not doing this to be sensational or to  be crazy or to impress people on camera
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4713679,4720320,this is how people eat here so what they  do  i'm gonna do can i have some of the beef  all right i put it in the blood and bile
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4720320,4726080,and then i put it in just a bile you can  see it's green please don't vomit
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4726080,4728320,together
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4732880,4738520,where  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4738719,4743840,luckily no one knows what i'm saying  that is easily the worst thing i've ever  eaten in my life that was just raw bile
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4743840,4750000,straight from the cow  the way we perceive flavor has a lot to  do with the food we consume as we grow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4750000,4755920,up oh my gosh just mere moments ago this  child spit out a twizzlers what she
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4755920,4762400,wanted this whole time was raw liver can  you believe it this is something so  fascinating to see children come here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4762400,4767920,and ask for  a soup give me some blood give me some  bio mommy that is crazy it just tells
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4767920,4776779,you so much about people right life is  whatever you're exposed to  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4779140,4784480,[Music]  meat is chopped into various cuts larger
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4784480,4790400,portions are stored and smoked inside  the house for future use  when it comes to cooking the remaining
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4790400,4796630,meat it's done two ways the men's way  and the women's way lucky for me i get  to try both
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4796630,4802000,[Music]  these savannah warriors grill the meat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4802000,4809440,positioning specific cuts on wood frames  and staking them close to the fire  season with a little bit of salt
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4809440,4815120,all the meat is roasting right now you  can see it's cooked much the same way as  the messiah was cooking their goat okay
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4815120,4820719,that one's done for sure the only big  difference here is uh that this is all  beef but it's very quick very efficient
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4820719,4827440,they put it all around the fire and then  it roasts until they think it's done  over here is the eating area i'm gonna  head there now
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4827440,4833440,the eating style here very similar one  person has the meat they are the pit  master they slice it off piece by piece
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4833440,4837840,and they hand it out i love it it's very  communal style
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4839199,4845920,yeah exactly  i don't know what piece i'm eating but  this requires some really strong teeth
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4845920,4851120,the taste is good they put salt on it  whoa we've got a new piece right here  this looks like a beef rib to me they've
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4851120,4858639,cracked it a few times let's see if this  is any more tender  okay yummy bb fairly juicy incredibly
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4858639,4864560,tough here's the thing people here don't  really mind the chewiness you know not  every place is like where i come from  there's a lot of cultures out there that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4864560,4871280,really appreciate chewy meat  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4871280,4879440,the women cook inside their kitchen  whatever wasn't eaten raw or grilled by  the guys is thrown into a pot to boil
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4879440,4884719,intestines leg meat beef fat ribs  tenderloin shoulder front and hind
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4884719,4890800,quarters all of it is here seasoned  simply with salt and let it simmer for  an hour
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4890800,4897440,while waiting for the food to cook the  ladies show me their own special way of  passing the time
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4897520,4902800,i did not know this was a thing you  could even do you can sniff tobacco
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4902800,4909120,what is going on here they have ground  tobacco in this little bitty bottle she  taps some onto her hand she spreads it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4909120,4914880,out and then she gives it a little bit  of a sniff right up in there yeah that's  right can i try a little bit here's the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4914880,4923719,problem i'm scared of tobacco because  when i was younger i tried chewing  tobacco and then after five minutes i  went behind the tree and i vomited
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4925410,4928470,[Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4933020,4936750,[Laughter]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4941760,4947760,oh it burns so bad i feel like i snorted  chili powder  i'm going to sneeze
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4949360,4957560,do i feel high yeah i do feel a little  bit spinny i feel some of the tobacco  effects i feel like my heart rate
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4958080,4963199,speeding up a little bit my eyes are  watering my head's a little bit loopy my  official initiation i'm one of the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4963199,4972659,ladies now all right  good stuff thank you  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4972719,4979600,lunch is ready and i'm opting to join  the ladies  oh yes let's eat ladies let's go
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4979600,4986080,the food is shared by all this concept  of considerate and almost compulsory  sharing runs deep in every tribe i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4986080,4992960,visited i'm curious the men  grill the meat the women boil the meat  why the difference it's the way they eat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4992960,5000320,the men prefer to make a barbecue but  for the woman they like to put some  small portion and they give to her
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5000320,5006159,so we have a couple different things  here on the menu we have the ugali  boiled beef a greenish broth hey why is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5006159,5012639,the broth a little bit green yeah from  the bowl oh thank god what is this one  this is a cheese oh it smells like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5012639,5015440,parmesan
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5017840,5023280,here  all right grab some of the bugali here  make a ball and then you give it a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5023280,5029159,little bit of a dip  and then try it out
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5031600,5037199,oh that's awesome it's like butter that  tastes like parmesan cheese it's so  awesome that's so delicious it is like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5037199,5042400,the ranch sauce of this village  you can dip anything in there that's  really nice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5042400,5049280,here i've got a piece of boiled beef  yeah she's eating it right off the rim  oh gosh it's still quite tough let me
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5049280,5054560,try it out  wow it's real chewy do people here like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5054560,5060239,the chewy meat yeah but it's tasty so  when they cook rinse off they're gonna  feel the taste really yeah so they want
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5060239,5066239,to chill with the suck they look really  tasty that's what i thought that might  be the case it's like the flavor release
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5066239,5072239,crystals and extra gum the taste is good  it just happens to be very very chewy oh  hello oh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5072239,5077679,oh that's mine no that's mine i touched  it whoa
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5078960,5085840,all right  [Music]  oh wow these are great we'll clean these
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5085840,5092639,out  the intestines taste somewhat clean it's  like i can handle it but i just have  ptsd from eating that raw gastric acid
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5092639,5098639,and that's what it tastes like inside  here maybe i'm doing it wrong because  yes the intestines are quite intense but  everyone here they take the ugali and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5098639,5104560,they kind of cut the taste with that  here she just handed me the broth now  this broth is from basically the boiled
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5104560,5111960,innards boiled beef all that together  oh that's actually quite nice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5113199,5119840,really salty tons of animal fats it's  just like a deep delicious beef broth  the broth with the ugali combination
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5119840,5126080,that is pretty awesome it's quite  delicious probably my favorite thing so  far today  this place the differentiation and work
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5126080,5131520,between men and women it's fascinating  to me because in most tribes i go to the  men would slaughter the cow they would
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5131520,5137840,skin it they would butcher it but after  the slaughter here the women jump in  right away and the women seem to do a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5137840,5141840,lot of work here for example
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5143310,5146399,[Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5151520,5157840,you know a long time ago men had  different traditional roles a hundred  years ago men were hunting animals men
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5157840,5164639,were protecting the village from lions  do they still do that they're still the  man protesting the village can see the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5164639,5170159,animals face there so the men they just  sleep near to the fair really the men
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5170159,5176800,sleep outside yeah they're sleeping  outside to take care of the enemy what  about when it rains  they have their cow's skin is very
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5176800,5181960,strong to protect them yeah oh my gosh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5183679,5190080,me it looks like you guys have  everything here all the basic needs are  met but what's missing
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5190080,5196000,uh  for us now just only by call but if we  need it we take the cow we send to the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5196000,5201120,local market we send it then we buy corn  so there's nothing missing no
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5201120,5206960,that's beautiful  sometimes people watching this show  mistake my casual way of interacting
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5206960,5212000,with locals for a lack of irreverence or  outright disrespect
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5212000,5217679,she knows the ministries reality can i  put my finger in there i'm never forced  to put on a fake display of deference
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5217679,5224000,for the simple reason that i don't pity  these people i've seen people here like  smile and laugh more than almost any

LYfVK0OjbBQ,5242320,5248960,way but that doesn't make it worse or  better  it's just different  out here there's a beautiful sense of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5248960,5256960,community a sisterhood where people are  truly connected there's fresh air mild  weather and one hell of a backyard view
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5256960,5263600,this is my last day to experience  tanzania and the only thing that makes  me feel pity is that as i go
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5263600,5267840,i can't take a piece of their lifestyle  with me

LYfVK0OjbBQ,127200,134080,found its way in here family structure  you've been chief here longer than i've  been alive the clothes they wear  everyone has like these big ear gauges i

LYfVK0OjbBQ,139840,146319,this is where people come hang out and  get drunk like if i was maasai this is  probably where you'd find me every  friday on this journey i'm pushing my
LYfVK0OjbBQ,146319,153040,palate to its absolute limit oh god you  can feel the warmth of the animal  just so you can witness some of the most
LYfVK0OjbBQ,153040,158080,extreme so they have all the organs raw  exotic some blood undocumented food
LYfVK0OjbBQ,158080,163680,practices in africa and this is the bile  anya
LYfVK0OjbBQ,163680,167400,she's saying it's so good
LYfVK0OjbBQ,175920,182000,today we're visiting members of the  zigua tribe an agricultural society  that's befriended one of nature's most
LYfVK0OjbBQ,182000,187760,hated creatures oh wow that's a big one  what's your own gumbo i've arrived just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,187760,193280,in time as plans for a community feast  are underway this is the beef that's  been roasting here we also do have
LYfVK0OjbBQ,193280,200400,chicken heads on a stick i don't know  that's going to be a minnesota state  fair food anytime soon and trust me  you've never seen food like this oh my
LYfVK0OjbBQ,200400,205760,god that's a piece of head was it  looking through there at one point this  two-day event is about to begin and it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,205760,209799,all starts here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,212000,218400,morning from tanzania today we are in a  segura village of about 1800 people the  zegua people reside mainly in a small
LYfVK0OjbBQ,218400,223920,coastal region in northeastern tanzania  to learn more about this hidden culture  there's no better occasion than a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,223920,229680,gathering like what we'll see today and  tomorrow  i'm gonna be witness to an entire cow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,229680,235519,being slaughtered and prepared for a  ceremonial feast the only problem is  they don't have any cows or livestock
LYfVK0OjbBQ,235519,240599,here that means we're gonna have to go  elsewhere to find it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,240640,246560,even though tanzania is home to over 100  different unique tribes that are  different in almost all aspects from
LYfVK0OjbBQ,246560,252159,language to religious beliefs these  groups still associate peacefully with  one another right now we are on our way
LYfVK0OjbBQ,252159,258479,to the messiah village i got to hang out  with the messiah a few years ago in  kenya this is a pastoral nomadic society
LYfVK0OjbBQ,258479,263680,all these guys eat is milk okay this is  breakfast here blood how do you find it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,263680,269759,milky and meat what is going on this is  goat sushi so it's so different from the  zigua tribe because here they have
LYfVK0OjbBQ,269759,276560,vegetables and they have crops so  they're very agricultural it's almost  impossible for these two tribes to  intermingle because the cattle from one
LYfVK0OjbBQ,276560,281600,tribe is going to eat the plants from  the other tribe right now the people of  the zugua tribe they want a cow so
LYfVK0OjbBQ,281600,287919,they're gonna have to trade something  for it whether it's crops or some  chickens or whatever they have that they  can offer
LYfVK0OjbBQ,287919,293280,after just a four mile ride we've  arrived at a maasai village
LYfVK0OjbBQ,294720,300800,so right here we've come to the grazing  pastures they can't just stay all day in  the pen they actually have to be brought
LYfVK0OjbBQ,300800,307440,out to wherever the food is today it's  here for today's event this is the  chosen one a young calf praised for its
LYfVK0OjbBQ,307440,313759,tender and sweet meat it looks like he's  gonna try to hook it by the leg it's  tough because they trust the shepherd
LYfVK0OjbBQ,313759,320919,they're usually around the shepherd but  as soon as he starts being weird they  all know something's up they'll try to  run away
LYfVK0OjbBQ,324270,329840,[Music]  starting from here they need to walk it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,329840,334960,all the way back to where we started  today so we took motorcycles here but uh  the cow can't exactly take a motorcycle
LYfVK0OjbBQ,334960,340480,back  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,341759,347919,while the calf takes its final walk to  the zigua village a group of  entertainers arrives bravely toting bags
LYfVK0OjbBQ,347919,353280,of deadly reptiles  i don't know what's going on yet there's  a giant python right here and then this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,353280,359680,guy is kind of playing with it these are  the zegua snake men known locally as the  one and gully
LYfVK0OjbBQ,359680,365120,holy cow he's not pleased  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,365120,371680,alas the calf has arrived to the village  and food preparation can begin  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,371680,378240,the calf is dispatched then portioned  into different cuts ready to be cooked  in the meantime just a few steps away
LYfVK0OjbBQ,378240,383440,villagers and entertainers are gathering  in larger and larger numbers  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,383440,389360,as the one and go nimbly prance among  the snakes it becomes immediately clear  that only a handful of villagers know
LYfVK0OjbBQ,389360,395280,how to handle these creatures while in  the periphery the rest look on with the  light and terror now that is dangerous
LYfVK0OjbBQ,395280,401440,he put it around his neck oh i put a  little bit on me  oh boy they can really squeeze the heck
LYfVK0OjbBQ,401440,409639,out of you  under the cooking tree things are also  heating up
LYfVK0OjbBQ,410240,416830,all of the calf meat is portioned and  hanged overnight waiting for tomorrow's  village feast
LYfVK0OjbBQ,416830,424880,[Music]  but tonight we dine on offals topped  liver is braised with ginger and salt
LYfVK0OjbBQ,424880,433039,on the other side tripe and intestine  but first the intestine has to be  braided  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,433039,438080,that's not the only braiding going on  oh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,438080,444479,all right oh oh yeah sure we can die  together the snake is pissed but it's  not squeezing our life out yet oh okay i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,444479,450560,see what looks like a black mamba what  i'm pretty sure is the world's deadliest  snake oh my gosh elisa python i know
LYfVK0OjbBQ,450560,457840,it's not venomous what do we do do we  dance  this tantalizing snake dance routine is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,457840,463360,not a rare sight here but i can't tell  if this is a religious ceremony a  spiritual ritual or just pure
LYfVK0OjbBQ,463360,469360,entertainment for the village folk  that's what i call a tick-tock dance  while i joined the snake dance the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,469360,476840,intestine and tripe joined together in a  pot with salt and a bit of lime  then boiled
LYfVK0OjbBQ,478080,483759,it for the food but not by the snakes  now that the group dance is complete
LYfVK0OjbBQ,483759,490240,it's time for the solo should i grab it  oh oh that's not the side i want to be  on see this is dangerous right here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,490240,495680,because it's coiled up it can just lurch  out at any moment  yes he went for the bike i know it'd be
LYfVK0OjbBQ,495680,502479,very entertaining for me to catch it i  have caught one before in florida but  i'm in the middle of nowhere in africa  if it does latch onto me no it's not
LYfVK0OjbBQ,502479,507840,poisonous or venomous but it's gonna  wrap around me and it's gonna be like a  thousand little razor cuts on my arm so
LYfVK0OjbBQ,507840,513039,as much as i want to catch it for the  entertainment value and my ego wants to  show off to these people it's probably
LYfVK0OjbBQ,513039,518839,not a good idea maybe tomorrow i think i  have a lot more to learn about how this  place works let's come back
LYfVK0OjbBQ,518839,524560,tomorrow alas dinner has begun with  elder members of the tribe the whole cow  the whole calf i should say is going to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,524560,529680,be prepared tomorrow but usually i've  seen this many places now to prepare  some of the innards the night before and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,529680,535600,that's what we have here lots of good  stuff the only problem is i don't have a  translator but i do have this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,535600,540959,here they speak their tribal language  and the national language swahili tina  languni
LYfVK0OjbBQ,540959,547600,sunny  that's right oh this is very useful how  do you say let's eat  i'm a teacher we are teachers a clerk a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,547600,553120,tourist a visitor i'm not feeling well  i'm sick i should not say that ah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,553519,556000,let's eat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,559040,564639,so everyone pitched in everyone helped  create what we see here and it looks  quite stunning
LYfVK0OjbBQ,569120,577279,liver i'm going to try some of this  liver  [Music]  oh you say yummy i could say may i go
LYfVK0OjbBQ,577279,584080,now  the liver is outstanding liver can be  really dry sometimes it's moist it's  plum it's juicy this is real good i feel
LYfVK0OjbBQ,584080,589440,like if you're not eating enough hugali  and you're eating too much meat people  will give you the side eye so i'm gonna  pretend that i want to eat some of this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,589440,595920,ukulele  ugali is found with nearly every meal in  this country cornmeal mixed with water
LYfVK0OjbBQ,595920,601760,remember saadza in zimbabwe this is the  exact same thing but with a different  name they're saying mix ugali whip it so
LYfVK0OjbBQ,601760,608480,this is okra mixed with beans and it is  so slimy it's like japanese nettle
LYfVK0OjbBQ,608720,613760,you really taste the okra but it's so  slimy and gooey it's a very fun texture  i like it kind of the deal is with every
LYfVK0OjbBQ,613760,619040,food the utensil is either your hands or  the uganda make it into a little bit of  a ball put your thumb into it grab some
LYfVK0OjbBQ,619040,625120,of this pumpkin leaf  i  love that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,625120,630959,heart  a lot of the food is going fast there's  one thing that's not going that quick  that is the intestines and the tripe
LYfVK0OjbBQ,630959,639230,here's what i like about the intestines  they braided it it's going to be chewy  and potentially delicious  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,641200,647920,when they braid it like that it creates  such an intense squishy texture it's a  little bit like some kind of a squishy  palamari yeah yeah this is kind of our
LYfVK0OjbBQ,647920,653279,starter meal this is our entryway into  the village into this community into the  meal we're gonna be having tomorrow am i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,653279,659440,making it weird just because i'm talking  to myself is that is that awkward  everyone stopped talking  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,659440,665519,day two with the zigua tribe today the  entire village will partake in a mammoth  beast i have a ridiculous amount here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,665519,670959,that i could never hope to eat  and i'll learn the secrets behind  africa's snake tribe wow that's a big
LYfVK0OjbBQ,670959,677040,one  [Music]  how are you i'm great joining me today
LYfVK0OjbBQ,677040,683519,goomba local of tanzania and fixer for  our entire journey in this country next  to him the chief how does one become a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,683519,690160,chief exactly  this man has been chief since 1973  that's 11 years before my parents
LYfVK0OjbBQ,690160,695600,accidentally conceived me they don't use  like a democratic way on how to select  the leaders and then instead of a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,695600,701680,four-year term it's more like a 50-year  term  i think the first thing we should do is  break some bread together there's a few
LYfVK0OjbBQ,701680,707760,different things here this is called a  one mandazi the making of mandazi starts  with wheat flour sugar yeast and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,707760,712880,sunflower oil mixed with water and  kneaded into a ball
LYfVK0OjbBQ,713120,720240,flatten the ball on a cutting board and  cut it into squares or triangles or  diamonds you know shapes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,720240,725420,now fry until they turn into golden  brown puffy pillowy chunks of heaven
LYfVK0OjbBQ,725420,731680,[Music]  oh i love it it's just a delicious fried
LYfVK0OjbBQ,731680,737040,bread very doughy on the inside it has  that fried outer coat that's so fun to  crunch through it reminds me of a new
LYfVK0OjbBQ,737040,742800,orleans beignet without the powdered  sugar does something get dipped into the  porridge you can use the same mandate
LYfVK0OjbBQ,742800,748320,this porch is made from corn right yeah  these corn kernels are left to soften  overnight in the morning they're pounded
LYfVK0OjbBQ,748320,755279,into a powder  mix that corn powder with water stirring  continuously over fire until it forms a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,755279,762800,thick porridge  [Music]  as an agricultural community corn sesame
LYfVK0OjbBQ,762800,768399,and saiso are the principal crops in  zigua fields the zigwa people they are  farmers right but they only practice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,768399,775279,small farming raising chicken and not  like commercial farming is there a  reason that they focus more on  agriculture
LYfVK0OjbBQ,775680,780959,they don't have any trade skills to do  anything so just a lack of knowledge  lack of experience yeah experience nice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,780959,787120,i want to try this quality video it's  like a little tanzanian donut you do  more batter is a tasty mixture of rice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,787120,793440,flour yeast and coconut milk  fry the batter in a specially molded
LYfVK0OjbBQ,793440,798360,tray until the outer coat crisps up
LYfVK0OjbBQ,802639,809360,oh my god this is unbelievable  it's like a little bit of natural  sweetness from the coconut milk in there  super crunchy on the outside doughy on
LYfVK0OjbBQ,809360,814720,the inside is this stuff that you ate  from the time you were a kid  this is not what i expected when i came
LYfVK0OjbBQ,814720,822399,here i knew there would be certain  staples like ugali meat you know stuff  that just comes from animals but this is  on a different level
LYfVK0OjbBQ,822880,827920,this is something i'm super fascinated  with it appears that the people here  follow or at least are influenced by the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,827920,833839,muslim faith so are people here muslim  they are muslim the primary religion  practiced by the zika people is sunni
LYfVK0OjbBQ,833839,839920,islam the largest branch of islam  children are often sent to muslim  schools for religious studies however
LYfVK0OjbBQ,839920,845600,like many african tribes spiritual  beliefs are strong in the community so  it's not always easy to tell where
LYfVK0OjbBQ,845600,851040,islamic customs end and more traditional  spiritual practices begin
LYfVK0OjbBQ,851040,856720,i was here yesterday and there were a  bunch of people they brought snakes in  bags they let them out and from my point  of view it looked like a show there must
LYfVK0OjbBQ,856720,862160,be some purpose beyond that what are  they doing with the snakes it's not  everyone who can do that you have to be  trained to become full-fledged in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,862160,869279,ongoing more specialized snake handlers  it's like they are rituals i don't know  actually to learn more about this  unusual and unexpected relationship
LYfVK0OjbBQ,869279,874639,between snakes and the zika people we're  meeting up with the one and goalie  leader and he's brought with him a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,874639,881120,little friend  is that a python yeah it's a prize oh  wow that's a big one ah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,881120,886980,what's your own gumbo it's not scary  don't worry no i'm not scary but i don't  want to touch them
LYfVK0OjbBQ,886980,894959,[Applause]  how much does this one weigh do you have  any idea  more than 50 kg over 100 pounds
LYfVK0OjbBQ,895920,901360,come on you're getting out of frame  you're ruining our shots as farmers  segua members are often hanging out
LYfVK0OjbBQ,901360,907120,where potentially dangerous snakes are  also hanging out one and goli men are  here to treat snake bites with various
LYfVK0OjbBQ,907120,912399,herbs and traditional methods for the  snake bite here in the village they  normally appreciate these guys compared
LYfVK0OjbBQ,912399,917920,to the hospital how long have you been  doing this type of job  it's more than 42 years what use do you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,917920,923120,have for these snakes so they normally  take the snake going to the forest to  collect the medicine they are sure that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,923120,930720,if they go this particular snake they'll  be able to win whatever they're going to  do in the forest so the snake is good  luck yeah they're good
LYfVK0OjbBQ,930800,936240,when villagers gather the one and  goalies stand out thanks to their red  bandanas a great branding idea i may
LYfVK0OjbBQ,936240,941920,consider trying for myself the stunts i  witnessed yesterday that's their way of  educating villagers on the topic of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,941920,948079,snakes showing that man and nature can  live in harmony even if that nature is  trying to bite you in the face we always
LYfVK0OjbBQ,948079,953759,have this kind of neck because they see  this as the king of all snakes when you  have this kind of snake you can also
LYfVK0OjbBQ,953759,960160,have another type of snake kind of like  if you can handle this snake you can  handle any snakes that's correct now  that the mystery of these snake charmers
LYfVK0OjbBQ,960160,966639,has been revealed i'm tempted to join  their squad  but first there's a whole village
LYfVK0OjbBQ,966639,969839,waiting to be fed
LYfVK0OjbBQ,972399,978079,there is a lot going on cooking has  started from morning even before  breakfast after an overnight marination
LYfVK0OjbBQ,978079,983680,the beef ribs and quarters are ready to  hit the grill here a very unique style  they built it out of wood and then they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,983680,988959,put a little bit of like a steel fence  on top and they just put big chunks of  meat on top of that so that's been
LYfVK0OjbBQ,988959,995120,roasting for hours kind of low and slow  then as you come down here you could see  the chicken so the chicken has been put
LYfVK0OjbBQ,995120,1001440,between two pieces of wood i've seen  chicken prepared like this in thailand  too so it must be a common thing  throughout the world it's an easy way to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1001440,1006720,hold the chicken and keep it from going  anywhere while you're grilling it while  the chicken is still far from being done
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1006720,1013199,the fragrance from this beef is luring  me in for a bite can we try this my man  could you cut a little bit
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1013199,1018560,oh  this looks real good  oh we got some juicy beef here here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1018560,1025600,please  i mean as long as we're being rude and  eating before everyone else i need to  take someone else down with me
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1025600,1030959,oh that's right on the outside where all  the seasonings have been it's like a  tasty dried out shell it's very juicy on
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1030959,1036959,the inside it's not super soft it's not  like it's a filet mignon or wagyu it's  got a little chew to it but it's good
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1036959,1043280,we had some thigh now he's cutting off a  big piece of rib one of the most beloved  parts around the world
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1043280,1050640,interesting because it's from a calf  this calf did not have a lot of girth on  it i'm trying to peel back the meat oh  there we go
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1050960,1056720,juicy chewy but delicious so no matter  what piece you grab they all have a  little bit different texture a little  different feeling because some got
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1056720,1063280,cooked a little more some pieces like  this are almost like a jerky some are  softer all of them are delicious  everything's almost ready dinner's about
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1063280,1072720,to begin very excited  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1072720,1078880,the feast is now finally being dispersed  among everybody there's no real like  eating table or area it's just wherever

LYfVK0OjbBQ,1250159,1256400,some of the flavors of that rice  definitely one of my favorite things  i've had so far in this village last but  not least chapati paired with chicken
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1256400,1262400,soup  the chicken hidden under the grilling  rack from earlier is hacked up and  boiled into a soup with various
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1262400,1268080,vegetables  here we have a leg oh they cut off the  nails the gizzard with a bonus intestine
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1268080,1273440,attached you can take the chapati use  that like a spoon or a fork and eating  utensils i'm gonna grab this use the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1273440,1278720,intestine i'm gonna make like a little  bit of a taco out of it i don't know if  anybody has ever had a taco in their  life
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1278720,1284320,[Applause]  clean chewy intestines and chapati it's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1284320,1292240,just flaky delicious layered bread i  love it so much  i have one thing to try out that i will  just do for the fans
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1292320,1299280,did i see this and get excited did i  look at this chicken head and think oh  my god i must try it it must be in my  mouth no not exactly but it's a delicacy
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1299280,1304720,here i mean people really appreciate it  it's usually reserved for the elders so  um here we go kind of like the chicken's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1304720,1310880,yawning  but then it was too big of a yawn the  game works like this whatever you can  peel off is what you eat oh gosh the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1310880,1317520,comb just came right off  it doesn't have a lot of flavor it's uh  half gooey and then half like a jerky it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1317520,1322559,kind of reminds me of some kind of asian  bar food or drinking food the eye just  looks like a sliced black olive so my
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1322559,1328960,brain's confused because i love black  olives actually i'll probably like this  too  it's squishy and a little sandy all
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1328960,1334559,right there's a braid in here somewhere  oh i'm squeezing the brain matter out a  delicacy i kind of made that up but
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1334559,1340720,there's a whole chicken but one little  brain it has to be a delicacy right now  it's called livery and fatty oily it's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1340720,1346480,kind of like coating my mouth in a fatty  chicken sensation that is it that is  nine different foods excellent the feast
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1346480,1352799,is complete bellies are full now it's  time for entertainment  [Music]

LYfVK0OjbBQ,1390640,1396000,wikipedia entry there's just direct  one-on-one experience observing what's  happening and asking as many questions
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1396000,1401039,as we can for sure these are some of the  most unique people i've ever hung out  with hour by hour i saw things i'd never
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1401039,1406400,seen before and it was an absolute joy  the level of cooking really blew me away  in dishes that i'd seen in other parts
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1406400,1412559,of the world that i didn't expect to see  here i had an incredible time and i hope  you guys got to learn something too i  want to point out one thing over here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1412559,1417080,and over here these are the fly  wranglers
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1419600,1425760,now we're heading westward to mount  kilimanjaro but what many tourists may  miss on their way to this legendary peak
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1425760,1432559,is one of this country's most unique  tribes meet the chaga people gina  languni sunny
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1432559,1440559,gina languni sunny do you think she  speaks swahili or maybe i don't speak  swahili  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1440559,1446400,around the base of africa's tallest peak  you'll find members of the chaga tribe  who have seamlessly adapted to life on
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1446400,1452400,the mountain side they don't have room  for a huge pen or a huge pasture and so  they've had to literally build a pen
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1452400,1459440,here out of wood today i'm on a mission  to show you a new version of paradise  this looks glorious a place of strong
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1459440,1465679,independent survivalists who make life  in the jungle look easy look at this  bountiful harvest the food they eat just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1465679,1472080,a little yeah just a little bit of raw  blood the booze they drink this is made  from fermented bananas it's something  like you've never seen before if you

LYfVK0OjbBQ,1482000,1488000,right now we're at the base of mount  kilimanjaro the tallest mountain in all  of africa  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1488000,1494080,this dormant volcano towers nineteen  thousand feet with five different  climate zones from the icy top to the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1494080,1500240,lush jungle at the mountain base we are  deep in the jungle right now it's almost  time for breakfast we need to go pick
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1500240,1507039,one ingredient before we can eat  [Music]  this is the home of the chaga people the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1507039,1513200,third largest ethnic group in tanzania  renowned for their prowess in  agriculture and their effective use this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1513200,1518880,one this right here  of bananas  oh meet tedeos he's invited me to his
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1518880,1525279,mountainside home to experience and  share the culture of his people but it's  way up there what's the plan
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1525279,1531360,today is doesn't get the bananas he  brings the bananas to him oh he's doing  the old poking technique whacking the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1531360,1537600,tree in half and collecting the goods  yes we got some bananas
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1537840,1543919,unlike other plants bananas can only  produce one fruit per stock so it's  important to cut down old stocks for the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1543919,1550480,new ones to grow our brave gatherer over  here has produced a whole what do you  call a bunch of bananas oh a bunch we
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1550480,1557840,have a whole bunch of bananas right here  so we're gonna pack this up head back to  the house and get breakfast started  let's do it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1559180,1565600,[Music]  on the way back there's one more
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1565600,1572400,ingredient needed for breakfast local  wild yams this is what i want oh that's  a tiny little yam another staple of the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1572400,1578640,chaga diet  here we have the bananas we've just  brought them back she's peeling it now
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1578640,1585360,and it is hard to peel off but you can  hear it's very tough and coarse as she  breaks it this is hard like a tuber let
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1585360,1590960,me see if i can crack it in half  yeah it just snaps in half there's  nothing soft about it and even on the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1590960,1597039,inside it looks pretty different from  other bananas i've seen before and with  this kind of hard constitution they boil
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1597039,1604480,it and then they make a banana soup that  is going to be our breakfast soon if i  didn't ruin it  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1604480,1611279,good morning thank you for joining me  today we're at your home right now this  place i'm looking around it's like  paradise do you feel that way ah no if
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1611279,1617039,you take me to your place maybe i can  feel the same thing so well i don't know  because if you go to my home state right
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1617039,1622080,now in minnesota you'll see about 30  centimeters of snow and you'll be  freezing your ass off does that sound
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1622080,1627360,like paradise maybe it would be my  paradise can you tell me what we're  going to be eating for breakfast today
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1627360,1632400,now we're just going to eat some kind of  food called the itori in swahili in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1632400,1638720,tori  yeah  dory or banana beef stew is a famous  tanzanian dish that comes originally
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1638720,1643919,from the kilimanjaro region  here they make it from bananas and yams
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1643919,1650720,i've heard of bananas for breakfast but  next these starches are topped with  boiled beef then another layer of banana
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1650720,1657679,yam some salt and water seal it with a  banana leaf and let it steam for 30  minutes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1657679,1663440,after it's cooked through add cooking  oil and water  mash it until it becomes one thick
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1663440,1669600,sticky paste and finish it off with beef  stock right i'm going to try just the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1669600,1675039,porridge part first without the beef  oh wow it doesn't taste like banana at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1675039,1680640,all it's just really starchy almost like  eating a potato so it's really thick and  quite delicious that's awesome and then
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1680640,1685679,there's some beef here  [Music]  a little tendon in there too
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1685679,1691200,careful  i just came here from meeting with the  zigua tribe
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1691200,1696320,and so they are very agricultural but  not pastoral at all and so they don't  really have any animals except for
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1696320,1702880,chickens when i asked why it was simply  because they didn't have the knowledge  about what to do with those animals and  how to raise them but here you have like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1702880,1708080,every farm animal i could imagine  where'd you learn all this we're just  heritaging this kind of lifestyle from
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1708080,1714240,our grandparents so you just grew up  like this  because even the maasai people they do  have livestock but they have to handle
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1714240,1721039,it in a very different way than you  because you're on the mountain here the  problem is we don't have enough spaces  where we can dress them free we call it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1721039,1727760,zero grazing system so we just tie them  inside and we just went outside looking  for different grasses and then we just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1727760,1733760,bring something back yeah to them so  it's like that  this is a fantastic start today we're
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1733760,1739919,going to try something that's really  traditional in the village we're going  to cook an entire goat do you have a  goat picked out already i have to decide
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1739919,1746880,and how will you decide by looking the  size and how old it is but not like how  much you like them i like them all but i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1746880,1752960,must choose one that's our next step  you're gonna see uh which one gives you  the side eye which is the meanest  looking one and we'll pull it out all
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1752960,1765759,right all right  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1769440,1775039,the goat is dispatched quickly the blood  is drained then the skin is carefully  removed
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1775039,1781200,the organs and innards are extracted and  laid out on a banana leaf the goat  itself is propped up on a wood rod and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1781200,1788240,moved to the roasting pit  right now we have the whole goat splayed
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1788240,1793440,out on a spit here the first step here  is they're taking the appendages they're  using leaves to actually tie them closer
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1793440,1799600,to the body they're too far away they're  going to get close to the fire they're  going to burn and just be charred to a  crisp we don't want that more or less we
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1799600,1805440,want everything to cook evenly so  they're going to get the legs tied up  and then from there it's just going to  rotate until it's all the way cooked
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1805440,1810559,through what's really unique about this  style is you don't usually see roasting  done this way usually the head would be
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1810559,1815840,taken clean off even the legs and the  hooves would be cut off but here this is  their traditional way of presenting it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1815840,1822640,even the ball sack is still there they  skin the whole animal except for
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1822640,1828799,i'm not sure if we eat the sack we'll  see you soon to add flavor a simple  combination of salt and lemon juice now
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1828799,1835600,the painful part basting the goat and  rotating every few minutes so it cooks  through evenly this process can take up
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1835600,1843200,to three hours  so while the goat is cooking i want to  give you a little bit of a house tour
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1843200,1848640,around this mountain you won't find a  traditional centralized village he has a  complex of a few different houses
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1848640,1854720,because a few different people live here  instead each separate household lives  emits its own banana garden bananas are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1854720,1860799,an essential crop here from daily  cooking to making an assortment of  beverages or selling them for extra cash
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1860799,1867279,and then he's got tons and tons of  animals besides fruits the banana stalks  allow chaga people to raise a variety of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1867279,1873760,animals even without grazing lands in  here a couple of cows and this is where  he's feeding them the banana tree so the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1873760,1879600,tree is soft it's supple you can  actually flash it up quite easily and  put it in here in this wooden trough and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1879600,1886399,they just they eat  despite its simple exterior inside this  animal house you'll find a whole zoo and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1886399,1891600,here are the calves eating the same  thing they have rabbits and they have  little baby rabbits over here it's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1891600,1898080,freaking adorable but don't get too  attached because these animals are not  pets they're food and dogs the dogs are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1898080,1903440,not pets they're also not food these are  alarm dogs and that's not all and here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1903440,1909919,even more animals you may recall they  also have goats unfortunately there is  one less goat here now but he's still
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1909919,1916320,got like eight nine ten goats part of  sustaining animals and crops here the  rich volcanic soil beneath our feet
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1916320,1922720,second is the knowledge accumulated and  passed down through generations this is  a very specific geography and climate
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1922720,1928720,which requires a very specific way of  life what's so unique about this area is  that it's built on a mountaintop they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1928720,1934960,don't have room for a huge pen or a huge  pasture and so they've had to literally  build a pen here out of wood and this is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1934960,1940000,where they hang out all day they've got  their food here what else do you need
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1940000,1946320,while i was touring his home tedeos was  making use of the goat's prized organs  to create a local favorite the goat's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1946320,1953120,innards are boiled with salt to create a  potent broth before eating you must add  one more ingredient you won't find at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1953120,1959360,any restaurant tadeos yes i'm here the  preparations are underway for the goat  goats on the fire but here we're about
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1959360,1964559,to try something i've never seen before  i mean i've tried a lot of blood dishes  but nothing like what you're about to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1964559,1972159,show me now can you just tell me how  this works  so the size of this we are just a little
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1972159,1977200,not not much yeah it's just a little bit  of roblox just a little of this  still a decent amount so now we are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1977200,1984159,going to pack the soup we call it white  soup right it's like a white milky broth  combining all the organs and the fats so
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1984159,1991120,that gets dumped into the blood and that  is steaming hot like boiling you can see  how changing very very slowly from red
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1991120,1996960,to brown when they change that means  they're ready to be consumed so you  don't eat raw blood ever no all right
LYfVK0OjbBQ,1996960,1999360,let's try it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2002159,2007760,that is potent it reminds me of many  dishes i've had in asia like a far broth  something that's just very deep in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2007760,2014480,flavor it's really incredible  because of its concentrated amounts of  salt and minerals you can most often
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2014480,2019760,find locals eating this dish on a sunday  morning when they have a hangover right  now he's got some stomach over here he's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2019760,2025519,gonna slice that into little bitty  pieces oh you put it in the soup all  right let's try it out
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2025760,2032159,oh man it's a really good texture that's  pretty good stomach stomach is tough for  me because some people are really good  at making stomach some people they're
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2032159,2037518,not and when they're not it can get  really bad this is quite delicious
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2037919,2043200,even when you were younger is this the  way you would prepare a goat the head is  there the legs are there so we do that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2043200,2049040,in example in special events when is the  last time you did it this way one year  ago so really for special occasions very
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2049040,2054079,very very special why do you keep the  head and why do you keep the whole body  together for example if i want to give
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2054079,2061440,somebody price i need him to see  everything now you see that is a god  because you can see the evidence
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2061440,2066638,heart kidney stomach lungs this soup  contains almost all of the goat's organs
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2066638,2072560,except for one the goat liver  that was saved for the fire then they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2072560,2079040,wrap it with coal fat and grill it until  the fat melts creating an epic flavor  shell we've had roasted liver before and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2079040,2085760,in many places here in africa even in  egypt it's very common that they cook  the liver straight away what makes this  especially unique though is that they've
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2085760,2092398,wrapped the liver in coal fat a big thin  membrane of fat that is kind of usually  wrapped around all the organs and stuff
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2092398,2098079,oh thank you all right so we all got a  piece cheers  oh wow right away there's a strong hint
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2098079,2103200,of goatiness i love goat but if you  don't like goat you will not like this  but then just beyond that sometimes when
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2103200,2109680,you eat liver that's not been prepared  very well it can like dry your mouth  while you're eating it but not this this  it's moist already plus they wrap the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2109680,2114880,fat around it too so it's kind of juicy  and fatty at the same time
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2115280,2122720,delicious i love it  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2122720,2128078,while the goat continues to roast we're  heading to the local market
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2129040,2135920,so it turns out we have almost  everything we need except for a few  ingredients so we're headed to the  market right now to buy some vegetables
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2135920,2143520,and a few other things  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2143520,2148880,my men yes man so we have a meat we have  a lot of meat there's one more dish you  want to make though with vegetables
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2148880,2154800,right what's that called kitalolo  quitololo yeah yeah i feel like i'm in  jamaica again what do we need from here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2154800,2160640,from here we need vegetables some  carrots yeah we need also some tomatoes  does it look like roma tomatoes do we
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2160640,2166000,have everything uh i think  i'm surprised that you need to go to a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2166000,2171760,market at all because you're such a  renaissance man you have everything at  your house so when you do need to buy  something what kind of stuff are you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2171760,2177359,usually buying for the market we must  buy sugar salt cooking oil some stuff  like that you can't even make your own
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2177359,2183599,cooking oil no way not yet no because we  have a good infrastructure i mean the  road yeah we can get everything straight
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2183599,2189200,here but before it was very very  difficult how long have you had a paved  road like this not more than five years
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2189200,2195680,i think wow yes but this area still  doesn't have electricity do they only  one year that is very very new wow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2195680,2203078,that's wild  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2203359,2208800,all right so preparation is underway  it's a long bit of preparation for today  the goat is taking much longer than i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2208800,2214000,thought it's now on our four maybe there  may be nothing left by the time it's  done roasting it'll just be a snack like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2214000,2220400,a crouton  right here can i see this she's just  broken open a nut i've never seen this  kind of nut before
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2220400,2226800,this is an oyster nut also known as a  queen's nut they come from berries that  can weigh up to 30 pounds they can be
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2226800,2233119,used to create nut oil or they can be  eaten raw oh as an added benefit they're  absolutely delicious i don't know what
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2233119,2238160,that is but really good it reminds me of  a brazil nut but it's flat something  between a brazil nut and like a water
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2238160,2244560,chestnut really good  so she's grating nuts and she's kind of  grating the leafy greens and look at the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2244560,2251599,way she does it it's incredible because  she just does everything by hand there's  no cutting board they just take the food  by hand usually stand over a bucket or a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2251599,2257119,bowl and they do it in their hand  here they have a very unique dish that  i'm very excited about because i'm
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2257119,2262560,hoping it's going to defy expectations  once again this soup is called matcha  lari a traditional dish from the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2262560,2269440,kilimanjaro region usually it's made  from bananas and beef but today they'll  swap that for goat organs and intestines
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2269440,2275760,boiled with bananas onions garlic  carrots and tomatoes until it all  becomes a mouth-watering stew all right
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2275760,2282160,so here i got some of the broth i have a  big piece of banana let's try it out  wow super savory little bit gaming
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2282160,2288160,slightly goaty broth the banana is  almost like a cassava just super starchy  very potatoey and then they have
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2288160,2294400,intestines liver fats heart lungs i  think i should share would you be  interested in some of this delicious
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2294400,2300160,soup  try it out i want to see what they go  for oh she see she's going for the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2300160,2305599,banana and she's going for i don't know  that's like the crotch muscle i'm not  sure what that is let's see what she
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2305599,2311520,thinks  [Music]  tomosana very delicious all right i've
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2311520,2317200,got my big old intestine right here  let's try it out  it's been boiling for a very long time
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2317200,2322960,so it's not like that usual kind of  squiddy toughness or chewiness it was  kind of soft and almost milky that's a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2322960,2329119,unique intestinal experience that's  pretty good all right so this is kind of  our appetizer i don't know how many  appetizers i've had today this is just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2329119,2335440,basically holding us over until that  goat gets dehydrated down to a crisp so  i'm very curious how that's gonna taste
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2335440,2341119,i'm gonna find out very soon  moment has finally come they've taken
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2341119,2348240,the goat off of the spit we need to take  it to the eating area but look at this  thing this looks glorious a whole goat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2348240,2355560,head feet everything right now headed to  the dinner table let's go
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2360960,2366880,we've climbed the mountain we've come up  here they've got the goat they're  putting it on the table and this part is  a little bit dangerous because these
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2366880,2373280,legs are well done oh they're breaking  off okay that's okay everything's okay  all right they're removing the wire from
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2373280,2379359,the tail and from the legs that was kind  of holding it on to the wood and then  now oh it's gonna be such a relief for
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2379359,2385839,the goat finally having that pulled out  of its ass from here they're just gonna  orient it a little bit differently we're  gonna add some more food some beer made
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2385839,2391680,from bananas all that coming together  and then it's time to eat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2393760,2399839,to join us in eating this entire goat  tadeos has invited more members of his  family oh i'm so excited the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2399839,2406240,presentation is incredible it's just a  whole goat there's no question i look at  this and i'm not like is that a kangaroo
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2406240,2412640,is that a giraffe no i know for sure  it's a goat and why why because of the  head yeah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2412640,2418640,so we have this we have some vegetables  we have some banana beer which i'm very  excited about shall we eat yeah now this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2418640,2424240,is roasted a little differently than any  goat i've seen before because it was not  basted they maybe put some lemon on it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2424240,2430640,in the beginning but there was nothing  to kind of keep moisture inside and i'm  wondering if it's going to be dry what's  it going to be like oh that's a big
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2430640,2436880,piece let's go for it  that goat is delicious i thought it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2436880,2442160,would be really dried out because it  shrunk by half the size while it was  roasting it's really just a little bit
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2442160,2449359,crispy on the outside and then really  soft and juicy and just full of goatee  flavor mmm tamu
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2449359,2454560,almosana really yummy  all right right here we have a piece of  the neck meat you know some places
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2454560,2459599,around the world if you're eating sheep  neck it's actually a delicacy we had  something like that in iran and you can
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2459599,2466400,see why this is so soft let's try it out  [Music]  that protein juiciness so good
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2466400,2473520,that's delicious and i want to keep  eating that forever but here we have a  vegetable too what is this this dish is  known as kita lolo it starts with naofu
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2473520,2480160,and kilodermal the chopped local greens  we saw earlier  [Music]  add sliced bananas and grated oyster
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2480160,2486560,nuts then it gets a little bit funky  they mix soda ash with water and pour it  in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2486560,2491599,cook it until everything softens up  and finish with sour milk that's been
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2491599,2497529,fermenting for two to three days  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2497680,2504640,all right i'm gonna try it out  i can feel the grated nuts i taste the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2504640,2510720,greens it's a little spinachy but like a  little bitter and then there's just a  hint of sourness from the milk but it's  not off-putting and it doesn't feel
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2510720,2516160,especially dairy-like it just feels like  something in here is a bit fermented  that is because of that sour milk wow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2516160,2521520,does this milk come from your cows and  you keep it in a container until it  turns sour
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2521520,2525599,how many days does the milk form two to  three days
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2526960,2531838,last thing beer made from bananas  bananas
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2533440,2539520,this beer is called mega it's a common  beverage among chaga people overripe  bananas are peeled and tossed in a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2539520,2545920,hollow log  then crushed with dry grass to squeeze
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2545920,2552720,out and filter the juice inside  the banana juice is mixed with millet
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2552720,2559200,flour then left to ferment for just a  few days after that you have a drink  that is super calorie dense plus it'll
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2559200,2565040,get you drunk all right oh you know i  went uh oh easy  he said that you have to test it oh i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2565040,2572999,taste it first  oh i couldn't here i go  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2578880,2585040,that's good  tom usana  oh yeah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2585040,2590720,there you go  your turn  wow it's interesting there's a little  banana pulp in there it does taste a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2590720,2597119,little bananay but sour and fermented  it's about as strong as regular beer  maybe like seven percent alcohol will
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2597119,2603680,this get me drunk sure yeah i love being  drunk  [Music]  you are 45 down you've lived here your
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2603680,2609520,whole life you've seen this place change  a lot added infrastructure roads  electricity for you what's your focus
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2609520,2614960,yeah i'm still have the young kids here  i want to build their future so i'm just  concentrating to make sure that they are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2614960,2620240,going to school well and they're just  studying well so that at the end they're  going to have their own better life when
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2620240,2627359,you say you want them to have a better  life how do you want it to be different  from yours for example in the village it  is not that easy to have your own car
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2627359,2633760,but if they get good education and good  job they can buy their own so is it more  about money or more about just catching
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2633760,2639920,up to the modern times as tanzania is  becoming more and more developed know  about money if you have money you can do
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2639920,2645760,anything you want to do but if you don't  have money  tedeos yes you're an incredible dude
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2645760,2651550,thank you thank you so much you're  welcome  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2651680,2657200,we're heading away from kilimanjaro  toward the serengeti on a mission to  discover the most unique out of this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2657200,2663838,world market you'll find in africa this  place is insane
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2664800,2670560,meet the messiah the masai number over  two million mostly in kenya and tanzania
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2670560,2675680,so they keep it in the gourd i guess it  can stay fresh in there a long time for  hundreds of years members of this tribe
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2675680,2680880,ate nothing but meat milk and blood they  have one of the most mesmerizing diets
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2680880,2686240,you'll find anywhere there's something  that is going to appear controversial to  the people who watch what follows and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2686240,2693680,that is the way the sheep is dispatched  it's dispatched by by by way of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2693680,2700319,today i'm saying yes shares whatever i  see whatever they offer that's ahead no  matter how extreme
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2700319,2710319,it all starts no i got i got it here  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2710319,2716319,the massage nomadic lifestyle revolves  around their cattle where they move  depends fully on where there's grazing
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2716319,2722319,land when the animals aren't grazing  traditionally they're kept in a pasture  surrounded by houses so they can protect
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2722319,2728560,their cattle from predators like lions  these days at least in this village the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2728560,2734319,setup is a little different as some  tribes begin to align themselves with  modern day tanzania they have decided to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2734319,2740000,move kettles and animals aside because  before they are getting a lot of  problems for the kids they are seeking
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2740000,2746160,here they've adopted the local currency  as they've learned to do business with  other tribes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2746160,2752000,isn't just about trading cows but about  buying and selling any number of  products products we'll soon see at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2752000,2758079,africa's biggest massage market  all right sir  how are you doing i don't know across
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2758079,2764000,from me tobiko the village chief next to  him adam our expedition leader we're  here we're in your village we're about
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2764000,2769119,to have some breakfast together so we  have these vessels for food although  they're empty and i believe the food is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2769119,2775359,currently residing in that gourd so  we're going to have la soro  [Music]  all right it gives a little bit of a mix
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2775359,2781359,you want to mix the corn and the milk  corn and sour milk this is what many  masai in this area eat for breakfast it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2781359,2787079,looks like yogurt  it's got protein i heard the word  protein
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2788000,2792960,corn kernels are separated from the car  before boiling
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2793920,2800240,now the corn part of this makes me  really curious because i've hung out  with the maasai people in kenya and  traditionally is told that the maasai
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2800240,2806000,people are nomads and they eat three  things blood  milk and meat and so i'm wondering was
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2806000,2813839,corn introduced later on when he was  young that's when he get introduced to  the corn  in a clay pot add corn sour cow milk and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2813839,2821280,mix  does this come from your cows yes they  come from these cows that mixture goes  into a calabash containing ash according
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2821280,2826720,to them the ash makes the food taste a  whole lot better  so they keep it in the gourd i guess it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2826720,2832318,can stay fresh in there a long time you  can stay there for a month a month oh  that's awesome cheers
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2833599,2839200,okay that's really interesting it's so  rich calorie dense this whole thing is  probably 800 calories
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2839200,2844240,it's a lot of vitamins so it tastes like  a very liquidy yogurt and then the corn  the corn reminds me of corn i've had in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2844240,2850000,mexico where it's kind of rubbery  starchy certainly not sweet at all but
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2850160,2856400,sorry still chewing it's so rich it adds  some starch it adds some texture and  even more calories to the dish so you're  not just getting milk how often do you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2856400,2862000,eat something like this  three times a day oh wow the corn in  africa is very interesting to me in most
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2862000,2867440,ways it's good because it's offered this  very affordable means for people to get  calories efficiently and inexpensively
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2867440,2872640,but it has disrupted the traditional  diets of  many many tribes all over the country
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2872640,2878240,when i go hang out with the himba people  they also are suddenly eating corn flour  and when i hang out here i see also
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2878240,2884559,you've incorporated corn largely into  your diet so if money was no object if  you had to choose just to do the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2884559,2889920,traditional style milk blood meat would  he prefer that over corn
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2891640,2898400,[Music]  if you drink only milk you feel hungry  fast so when you incorporate to a corn
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2898400,2903920,you stay for a long time so even if we  have a lot of cows a lot of animals he  will still
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2903920,2911280,prefer to have the corn first of all the  breakfast wonderful thank you we've come  here today to experience eating some
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2911280,2918559,sheep the masai way  there's something that is going to  appear controversial to the people who  watch what follows that is the way the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2918559,2925359,sheep is dispatched by way of  strangulation i guess you could say  cutting off its airway
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2925599,2931760,tradition has it and when sacrificing an  animal the men will walk it outside the  village to slaughter and cook
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2931760,2937078,later bringing back dedicated cuts for  the women
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2937680,2940809,[Applause]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2943550,2948720,[Music]  you know out here you probably just have  the two options strangulation or slicing
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2948720,2954480,the throat do you think one of those is  more humane or easier for the animal  than the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2955040,2960800,suffocating other much better for the  animal because they die fast you think  that like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2960800,2966559,withholding air is actually going to be  faster than waiting for it to bleed out  yeah suffocating is faster but also the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2966559,2971750,animal do not suffer from cut i never  thought about it that way
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2971750,2977680,[Music]  i've always opted to document the way  cultures around the world slaughter
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2977680,2984640,animals because these actions tell their  own story  here in this village they cut off the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2984640,2990000,goat's airways until the animal  suffocates and dies  they do this to keep the soon to be
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2990000,2998790,eaten blood inside the animals  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,2999200,3004480,they've just skinned the entire animal  the blood since it's not been released  it's completely pooled within the animal
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3004480,3009599,and if my last experience with the  messiah in kenya is any indicator  i think i know what's going to come next
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3009599,3014880,they're slaughtering it in a way i've  never seen before because i mean almost  always you see people skin it and then
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3014880,3020319,gut it but they're kind of working  around all the organs  the other side of the ribs there is a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3020319,3025760,pool of blood remaining  oh boy oh  wow he'd
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3025760,3031359,you just never get used to it oh he  slurped it up like it was jello all  right hold on save some for the rest of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3031359,3037440,us  oh my god okay let's go for it you got  to be quick here oh god it's still you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3037440,3042480,can feel the warmth of the animal just  like that huh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3042480,3047480,god damn it  no i caught it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3055150,3061440,[Applause]  it's salty  it's irony it tastes like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3061440,3067200,raw blood my instinct is to kick it back  and to puke it up  i will not let that happen
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3067200,3075359,okay it's all ptsd now they've taken the  kidney here they cut the kidney in half  he puts that in my hand okay fantastic
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3075839,3079720,okay piece of raw kidney
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3088480,3094400,yeah yeah you eat that you know what the  breakfast was actually pretty nice  this guy he is taking it down like a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3094400,3099839,champion like a warrior  i can't do it i want a pop-tart i want a  toaster strudel i want pretty much
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3099839,3105760,anything but this right now  i'm not sure why just some people get  the blood and others don't but man that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3105760,3111760,guy's a blood fiend huge fan so now i  believe they're gonna finish taking it  apart portioning the animal out the way
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3111760,3116960,they portion it is very important in  this tribe and in this village because  each piece is for a different person
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3116960,3123440,dependent on their sex whether they're  pregnant dependent on their age  so while that's happening
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3123440,3132480,i'm gonna go clean up  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3132480,3138000,so the meat has been roasting now for  about 30 minutes they're taking it off  everything's ready let me point out this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3138000,3143440,right here from this side you might not  be able to tell what it is that's the  head so the head they charred it they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3143440,3148960,scraped off all the hair and then now  the whole skull was split in half you  can even see the tongue in the very
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3148960,3154800,center i can't believe the accuracy with  which they've been able to split it open  carefully and roast the whole thing all
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3154800,3163559,the way through  [Music]  boom okay here we go please
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3166480,3173040,it looks like we're going to be trying  out one piece at a time right here is  either the front or back leg and  everything's shared in a very communal
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3173040,3178720,style it's like brazilian barbecue  oh thank you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3179040,3184240,super juicy very delicious you must  understand no seasonings nothing has  been added it's also one of the fastest
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3184240,3189839,preparations i've ever seen in my life  from the dispatching of the goat until  eating right now is probably an hour or
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3189839,3195040,less super quick and efficient it makes  sense because back in the day if you're  eating this constantly for your main
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3195040,3201839,source of protein or your main source of  calories period you would have to be  able to do it quickly some of these  pieces are a bit more medium not cooked
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3201839,3207119,all the way through something tells me  they don't mind that good  yeah  there's going to be nothing left of this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3207119,3212640,animal when we're done  in just a matter of minutes this whole  leg is just gone
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3212640,3218319,now this is something i've never tried  with the messiah i've tried the ribs  i've tried legs but the head oh thank
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3218319,3223359,you that is a lower jaw not a lot of  meat but right back here i just saw the  cheese
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3223359,3228520,super tender super delicious  all right so he's smacking the jaw right  now  what
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3228520,3234079,[Music]  i didn't even know this cut of meat  existed please
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3234240,3240400,he just cracked open the jaw and out  comes  whatever that is oh it looks like a  noodle
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3240400,3246480,it's good  this is part of the efficiency i'm  talking about they can't waste anything  i mean why would they want to cutting
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3246480,3254079,off the tongue this has to be one of the  most prized bites of the entire sheep  oh is this for me what
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3254079,3261440,big fatty beautiful i'm gonna try to  just take one slice i feel bad i wanna  share it i'm gonna keep this one here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3261440,3267920,please yeah good good i think i did the  right move everyone's sharing it they're  loving it take a look at this you can  see the fat from the base of the tongue
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3267920,3273680,inside the tongue it is juicy really  meaty and then there's kind of like the  bark that's built up from roasting over
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3273680,3279839,the fire here  [Music]  so chief i do have a few questions  because i know these days the cattle are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3279839,3286079,not just for your personal consumption  you're eating some like today but you're  also selling them at the market so how  do you decide what to eat and how you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3286079,3292400,decide what to sell  i'm buying them  so the one that looks very healthy the  one that they are eating the one that's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3292400,3299520,not very healthy that is for sale all  right don't worry i won't share your  secrets with anybody especially at the  market where we're going next
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3299520,3308720,[Music]  a few miles later and we've arrived at  tanzania's isolated masai trading market
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3308720,3317119,a place with its own out of this world  goat alley this is where folks come to  eat and we're gonna see that soon
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3317520,3322640,this place has been around since 1954.  even before tanzania gained independence
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3322640,3328559,once a week this plot of dusty land  becomes a colorful hot spot packed with  action
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3328559,3334799,each friday chief tobiko and his nephew  gideon bring their livestock here to  sell we've come to low key market this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3334799,3340640,is one of the wildest most unique  markets i've seen anywhere in the world  and i've been to a good amount of places
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3340640,3345760,here they have not only food but they  have livestock they have everyday  commodities anything people would need
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3345760,3351599,for day-to-day life so i'm going to show  you everything i can find food and  otherwise first to the livestock area
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3351599,3355920,let's move  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3357200,3363040,back in the day this place was only  populated by local messiah but over the  years other tribes from neighboring
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3363040,3369359,regions have begun trickling in all  right this is pretty wild the foundation  of this market starts with the livestock
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3369359,3374720,and no protein is consumed more in  messiah life than goats there's a bunch  of different goats too look at this one
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3374720,3378000,with the butt with the dumbbell
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3381359,3385519,i don't think he liked that very much  thank you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3386880,3393280,i think i'm in  in these parts cattle are wealth and a  form of currency the more cattle you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3393280,3398960,have the wealthier you are if you have  no cattle you're probably broke if  you're here if you're selling goats
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3398960,3405440,what's a good price you would hope to  get for a goat sabine some money so 60  000 up to 100 000 depend on the size of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3405440,3411520,the guard okay that's pretty affordable  they're also selling cows i want to see  the cow area
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3411920,3419599,just outside the goat pet you'll find an  open patch with folks selling cows to  the highest bidder 350
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3419599,3426160,this man walked all the way here with  three cows it's late in the afternoon  and he's still yet to sell a single one
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3426160,3431280,the word is around town some people will  take like a sick cow or an unhealthy cow  they'll bring it to the market is this a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3431280,3437040,healthy cow  it's good  i don't know how you test such a thing  but he says the cow is in good shape
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3437040,3442240,although we do know that some people  bring the unhealthy market  wow this guy he does lack a little
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3442240,3448000,confidence in negotiating because i'm  not negotiating at all and he's already  dropping the price rule one uh don't do  that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3448000,3453440,thank you very much  we're continuing on in the market here  is where they have all the produce and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3453440,3460079,this is stuff that's going to be local  to tanzania and the area in general so  there's tomatoes onions corn lots of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3460079,3466720,different brightly colored foods and  right here we just found some fried  bread too  with livestock as a market staple over
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3466720,3473440,time local farmers began bringing and  selling produce of all kinds but when  people gather especially over a long hot
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3473440,3478880,day they need to eat  this next place is insane i call it goat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3478880,3486799,alley right now you can see as we're  walking in slaughtering goats on this  side slaughtering goats jumbo jumbo
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3486799,3493119,that meal we had already today you're  going to see the same kind of iteration  all over the place because that's what  people prepare here and that's what they
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3493119,3499119,eat here i mean look at this  the staple food like really the food the  messiah are known for and there's just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3499119,3504880,dozens of places serving this here it's  wild to see this thing that's really  based on village life on small
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3504880,3512400,communities they have kind of  commercialized it here and so people can  come they can get the goat like they're  used to eating at home
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3512400,3515400,incredible
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3518319,3524000,at the end of goat alley just a few  steps away you'll find this place guys  we've made our way to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3524000,3530000,a bar this will not surprise you if you  know me that's where people come hang  out and get drunk like if i was maasai
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3530000,3535040,this is probably where you'd find me  every friday  hub owner miss prisca owns more than one
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3535040,3542640,of these happy houses right here in this  bucket there's a corn beer and then it's  poured in a huge cup
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3542640,3548559,i look like a little kid at a football  game i've got like my big drink a big  plate of food like i'm ready to roar at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3548559,3554640,the picnic here  it's not fun to drink alone i'm gonna  hand out some beers to these guys too  asante guys cheers i don't know if
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3554640,3561359,people cheers here but cheers  wow that is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3561440,3567520,it's milky it's fermented for sure it's  thick it's like getting drunk off of  milk just imagine a bunch of corn that's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3567520,3573599,been sitting in a pile in a wet sheet  for a week that's what it smells and  tastes like and i can see why people  would want to be in here and hang out in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3573599,3580079,here because it is scorching outside  it's nearly 90 degrees it's nothing but  heat and then dirt beneath you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3580079,3586480,drinking is easy but if you want to eat  it's byop bring your own plate just a  few steps away you'll find one of the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3586480,3592799,few food options here that isn't grilled  goat  pilau  a blended rice with chopped goat and a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3592799,3598559,load of spices kidney beans tomato and  onion salad and finally goat stew look i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3598559,3603680,didn't say it wouldn't be goat i just  said it wouldn't be grilled goat oh  super yummy beans and rice it's
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3603680,3609839,delicious it's about what you would  expect this is a very balanced plate so  i'm gonna get that all in one spoonful
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3609839,3616559,yummy tender goat it's a little bit  different i mean it's been stewed as  opposed to being roasted i gotta say the  average person from my hometown if you
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3616559,3623119,gave them this plate they would love it  but if you put them in this setting it  would blow their head off they would be  so overwhelmed by all the stimulation
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3623119,3629520,that there is here there's hanging  animals everywhere and just the complete  circle of life is here so that is what  people might have some trouble with but
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3629520,3634880,the food itself is delicious it's really  good oh i'm feeling the corn beer a  little bit i got a little bit of a buzz
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3634880,3640160,i like it  this is excellent bar food and this  whole plate get this cost
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3640160,3646319,one dollar for all this rice meat  vegetables it has everything this i  think you could probably get about five  of these for a dollar for two dollars
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3646319,3651280,you can get a good buzz and a full  stomach  i like it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3653920,3660000,motorcycle tire sandals seem to be a  massage innovation i also saw them in  kenya first of all you can get shoes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3660000,3665599,from here shoes that are already made  but these are called zero kilometer  shoes that means these are new-ish tires
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3665599,3672880,the special thing they do here is they  customize them and they fit them to your  feet exactly  that's one potential shoe and i don't
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3672880,3678079,know i need to find a matching tread it  doesn't say the size of the tire on here  all right i gotta look around
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3678079,3683119,this is pretty good am i gonna be  walking uh in circles if i get the wrong  tread it doesn't match i think right
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3683119,3689839,here is pretty good they're not exactly  the same width but they're close enough  i'm gonna try walking around in these  let's see how it goes
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3689839,3695040,first of all these are my actual shoes  i've been putting off shoe shopping for  a long time my real shoes look like crap
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3695040,3703280,time for some new ones this is how  they're made using a knife a hammer a  few nails and a lot of craftsmanship
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3703280,3708319,this shuster is cobbling together custom  footwear made from abandoned tires he
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3708319,3713520,claims they'll last for two years this  seems like a deal i cannot pass up
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3713520,3720079,my gosh you've done it well done look at  this i got new shoes made from  motorcycle tires so that is pretty
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3720079,3726559,incredible  i got my new shoes let's take a stroll

LYfVK0OjbBQ,3884000,3889520,testicles off he's going to slice them  up i'm going to try it out  aside from these tasty gonads my final
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3889520,3895280,meal includes hacked up pieces of goat  back  and bananas simply slit it down the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3895280,3900319,middle and let it fry  the day here is winding down the sun's  going to set in a couple of hours and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3900319,3905359,that means everyone is going to be out  of here but right now even more food  that i found and also i found these two
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3905359,3910720,guys from the village hey how you doing  i lost him for a little bit  earlier i was competing to win a warm
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3910720,3916319,coca-cola i don't know why i'd be doing  that when i could just buy a warm beer  ah somewhat refreshing intoxicating
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3916319,3923520,though  here let's take a tour of the platter  this is kind of the lower back of the  goat fried bananas and then the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3923520,3931599,testicles something that gives men like  us power not that we need it  but couldn't hurt to get a little help
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3931839,3938720,i'm going to try ooh would i try first  nice little pieces of meat  now here they have their own salsa a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3938720,3944960,chili sauce if you want  salty but a little bit of spice like a  three out of ten not bad

LYfVK0OjbBQ,3981599,3988079,like it it's a very different texture of  meat it's a weird feeling it's so hard  to explain it almost like eating a  flaky fish i don't know it doesn't make
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3988079,3994640,sense i gotta say not bad and a good way  to end the day a little bit of manpower  hormone manpower
LYfVK0OjbBQ,3994640,4001119,you know what i love about today almost  three years ago i went to kenya and i  got to experience the traditional side  that goes back decades or hundreds of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4001119,4006880,years but now in parts of africa people  are adapting to modern times and to  modern development here you can see the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4006880,4013680,messiah taking interesting rituals and  customs that usually would only take  place within their village and they're  sharing it in big communities and even
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4013680,4018880,with outsiders people who aren't messiah  people from other villages even my  stupid pace we can come here we can take
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4018880,4024000,part and enjoy this very traditional  food and sit short of the shoulder with  the messiah people at the same time the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4024000,4029039,messiah people are learning from other  tribes and other people as well so as  our world is becoming more globalized
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4029039,4035838,and more connected it's fascinating to  see the next step for the messiah people  that said cheers
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4037599,4043200,it's my last day to experience a rarely  seen and rarely tasted side of africa
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4043200,4048319,meet the da'toga tribe  a tribe with clothing culture and

LYfVK0OjbBQ,4103600,4109278,oh boy  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4109278,4115359,bringing an offering or a gift as a  guest is an expression of goodwill all  right here we go here we go
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4115359,4121278,whether it's a bottle of wine or  something slightly more substantial oh  there they are i see the villagers
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4121278,4127359,the gesture shows that you've come in  peace and as a friend what to bring  depends on the tribe and what they value
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4127359,4133040,for the dattoga people a chicken or a  goat will do but if you really want to  make a good impression no no no no wrong
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4133040,4138950,way well a cow couldn't hurt try to  destroy the house  oh [ __ ]

LYfVK0OjbBQ,4168960,4173238,wow everyone here looks so gorgeous
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4176000,4182400,considered by some to be the oldest  tribe in tanzania occupying the northern  region around manyara with a population
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4182400,4188960,of about 30 000  their village and their houses look  different from any i've seen so far in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4188960,4194560,tanzania multi-room compound structures  built with sticks mud and manure topped
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4194560,4200400,with dirt and grass  as pastoral semi-nomads
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4200400,4206960,they depend on their cattle and their  cattle depend on them to seek out and  find fresh grazing land when one area is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4206960,4212239,depleted they pack up everything move  and start again
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4212400,4219199,with all the care they require the  cattle also give back they can be sold  or traded their skin is used to make
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4219199,4224480,clothing  and their milk is used for sustenance
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4226800,4232630,this is breakfast prepared by the women  of the tribe today as with most days  we'll go with porridge
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4232630,4238719,[Music]  corn is ground down to a fine powder  using a heavy stone
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4238719,4244320,add corn flour to hot water while  constantly mixing to avoid any lumps
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4244320,4250320,finally add fresh cow milk mix until  it's bubbling hot then served in a  handmade gourd
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4250320,4256000,i love the bowls here all the bowls are  made from gourds and then it has a  leather strap to hold on to i want to
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4256000,4260610,try this out  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4261199,4267199,it's very hot i'm not going to taste  anything for days  you have to do like this to make it cool
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4267199,4272560,down i got to wait a couple minutes on  this this is a village where you grew up  yes and at what age did you leave the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4272560,4277679,village when i was 26 26 yosef was born  and raised in this datoga village
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4277679,4284080,wanting to show the world his people's  unique culture he devoted himself to  learning english and becoming a god
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4284080,4289760,today he'll be the bridge between me and  a culture i've never witnessed before i  should say that porridge is good in the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4289760,4295840,morning they used to drink so you feel  hot and also it's nice for the small  baby what about a big baby
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4295840,4301840,okay here we go  it's almost like a really hot milk with  some corn flour mixed in it's very nice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4301840,4307920,though and it really warms you up i feel  good  is this something they usually eat for  breakfast yeah every day is it just
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4307920,4312960,quick yeah quick easy that makes sense  everyone likes a quick easy breakfast  even here so people can get started with
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4312960,4319679,their day i'm curious about some people  have some marks and scars around their  face how old were you when you got the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4319679,4325760,scarification here  she said i was around 15 or 16.
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4325760,4331760,everyone receives a scar on their  forehead and eyelids at birth it's  believed these scars will protect
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4331760,4337679,eyesight and prevent headaches she has a  gorgeous tattoo right here i'm a big fan  i'll try to get my wife to get a tattoo
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4337679,4343360,like that  when tribe members reach the age of 15  they can get tattoos or further
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4343360,4348640,scarification of their choosing was this  painful did that hurt
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4349360,4355450,she said this hats a lot because they  take the needle and then they cut it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4355450,4361679,[Applause]  before migrating to tanzania the  datoga's origins are believed to be in
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4361679,4369239,southern sudan or the western ethiopian  highlands going back 3 000 years
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4375199,4379920,timeless tribal traits can still be  witnessed today
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4381520,4386960,their language  and especially in the way they present  themselves
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4386960,4392400,i'm curious about the way they dress  themselves up for example everyone has  like these big ear gauges
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4392400,4398480,from what age are they expanding their  ears 15 years so they make the small  hole and they make a big obvious yeah
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4398480,4404640,because it takes time to stretch out oh  can i put my finger in there  okay i can fit two whole fingers in her
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4404640,4411280,ear hole that's pretty good you know she  can get three fingers she got three of  her own fingers in there
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4411280,4418239,oh she gives it a little bit of a spit  she shines it  oh  wow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4418560,4425199,very nice oh okay  oh yeah give me some time i think i can
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4425199,4431520,get there  yeah so she said no problem you just  take the knife
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4431840,4436069,i'll consider it  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4437440,4443199,women are tasked with taking care of  children cooking everyday meals making  clothes and jewelry so this is some of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4443199,4449040,the leather that they've made here oh  wow it is heavy i mean this is like four  or five pounds you will not find that at
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4449040,4455120,h m maybe forever 21.  as for the men  not right now but sometimes they have
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4455120,4462080,important tasks too  like protecting the village from enemies  or building houses
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4462080,4468320,daily life centers around tending to the  cattle this is also man's work walking  with the cattle for miles in search of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4468320,4474480,grazing lands  on the occasions when they do sacrifice  an animal for consumption the men are
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4474480,4479760,also tasked with dispatching  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4479760,4487360,why do they put milk in its mouth they  put the milk in the mouth to wish to  have a lot of cows in the future
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4490100,4497040,[Music]  it is essential that the animal's blood
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4497040,4503679,be kept inside  so rather than bleeding it out and  wasting precious calories they instead
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4503679,4509440,opt to suffocate the creature using  sticks and applying pressure to its  throat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4509440,4514800,the chef prays until the animal draws  its final breath
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4515120,4521760,in most tribes i've visited the work of  slicing dicing and butchering is left up  to the men but not in the case of the da
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4521760,4524760,toga
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4527840,4533440,there is no doubt that this is a messy  laborious task but that doesn't mean  it's without its purse so here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4533440,4538960,traditionally the women are the ones  handling all the butchering skinning  retrieving the blood
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4538960,4544639,what that means also is that the women  get first dibs on this blood
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4546480,4553840,looks tasty now we all know that i've  tried blood already i tried it with the  maasai people and it was outstanding
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4554400,4559679,yeah yeah you eat that right so i don't  need to do that again but this is really  the first time for me that i've seen the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4559679,4565040,women drinking raw blood i've seen it  many places with the men especially with  the messiah men but here the women
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4565040,4573039,they've got the blood all to themselves  anya  oh  i'm so full i just had lunch
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4579120,4585520,at first i just saw the blood and i  thought well i just had blood yesterday  i don't need to try it again i know what  blood is like here they're doing
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4585520,4592080,something new something i've never seen  before so they have all the organs raw  raw liver raw heart and this is the bile
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4592080,4596880,from the animal can i see that oh god  why am i doing this
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4597520,4603920,this revolting green liquid is a  combination of gastric acid and bile  squeezed out from the small intestine of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4603920,4609520,the animal this is going to be mixed oh  actually she's mixed it already here she  has some blood gastric acid and there
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4609520,4614800,might be liver in there too it's hard to  say i don't really want to finger around  in there but this is kind of a delicacy
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4614800,4621600,here  oh gosh that was such a big piece  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4621600,4626120,so  give it a little bite
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4639890,4642939,[Music]

LYfVK0OjbBQ,4660560,4666000,teeth tearing the tissue apart slowly as  you run your mouth through it it is a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4666000,4672719,creepy interesting unique texture i've  not discovered anywhere else finish it  up let's go let's go we didn't come here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4672719,4676040,to play around
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4691120,4696320,it's the only time i've ever gagged on  this show  it's just like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4696320,4702239,drinking stomach acid yeah have a little  bit of a sip please  show me the way
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4702239,4706440,anya  oh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4708400,4713679,this is the last thing i'm gonna do i'm  not doing this to be sensational or to  be crazy or to impress people on camera
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4713679,4720320,this is how people eat here so what they  do  i'm gonna do can i have some of the beef  all right i put it in the blood and bile
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4720320,4726080,and then i put it in just a bile you can  see it's green please don't vomit
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4726080,4728320,together
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4732880,4738520,where  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4738719,4743840,luckily no one knows what i'm saying  that is easily the worst thing i've ever  eaten in my life that was just raw bile
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4743840,4750000,straight from the cow  the way we perceive flavor has a lot to  do with the food we consume as we grow
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4750000,4755920,up oh my gosh just mere moments ago this  child spit out a twizzlers what she
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4755920,4762400,wanted this whole time was raw liver can  you believe it this is something so  fascinating to see children come here
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4762400,4767920,and ask for  a soup give me some blood give me some  bio mommy that is crazy it just tells
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4767920,4776779,you so much about people right life is  whatever you're exposed to  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4779140,4784480,[Music]  meat is chopped into various cuts larger
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4784480,4790400,portions are stored and smoked inside  the house for future use  when it comes to cooking the remaining
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4790400,4796630,meat it's done two ways the men's way  and the women's way lucky for me i get  to try both
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4796630,4802000,[Music]  these savannah warriors grill the meat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4802000,4809440,positioning specific cuts on wood frames  and staking them close to the fire  season with a little bit of salt
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4809440,4815120,all the meat is roasting right now you  can see it's cooked much the same way as  the messiah was cooking their goat okay
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4815120,4820719,that one's done for sure the only big  difference here is uh that this is all  beef but it's very quick very efficient
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4820719,4827440,they put it all around the fire and then  it roasts until they think it's done  over here is the eating area i'm gonna  head there now
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4827440,4833440,the eating style here very similar one  person has the meat they are the pit  master they slice it off piece by piece
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4833440,4837840,and they hand it out i love it it's very  communal style
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4839199,4845920,yeah exactly  i don't know what piece i'm eating but  this requires some really strong teeth
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4845920,4851120,the taste is good they put salt on it  whoa we've got a new piece right here  this looks like a beef rib to me they've
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4851120,4858639,cracked it a few times let's see if this  is any more tender  okay yummy bb fairly juicy incredibly
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4858639,4864560,tough here's the thing people here don't  really mind the chewiness you know not  every place is like where i come from  there's a lot of cultures out there that
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4864560,4871280,really appreciate chewy meat  [Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4871280,4879440,the women cook inside their kitchen  whatever wasn't eaten raw or grilled by  the guys is thrown into a pot to boil
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4879440,4884719,intestines leg meat beef fat ribs  tenderloin shoulder front and hind
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4884719,4890800,quarters all of it is here seasoned  simply with salt and let it simmer for  an hour
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4890800,4897440,while waiting for the food to cook the  ladies show me their own special way of  passing the time
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4897520,4902800,i did not know this was a thing you  could even do you can sniff tobacco
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4902800,4909120,what is going on here they have ground  tobacco in this little bitty bottle she  taps some onto her hand she spreads it
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4909120,4914880,out and then she gives it a little bit  of a sniff right up in there yeah that's  right can i try a little bit here's the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4914880,4923719,problem i'm scared of tobacco because  when i was younger i tried chewing  tobacco and then after five minutes i  went behind the tree and i vomited
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4925410,4928470,[Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4933020,4936750,[Laughter]

LYfVK0OjbBQ,4979600,4986080,the food is shared by all this concept  of considerate and almost compulsory  sharing runs deep in every tribe i
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4986080,4992960,visited i'm curious the men  grill the meat the women boil the meat  why the difference it's the way they eat
LYfVK0OjbBQ,4992960,5000320,the men prefer to make a barbecue but  for the woman they like to put some  small portion and they give to her
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5000320,5006159,so we have a couple different things  here on the menu we have the ugali  boiled beef a greenish broth hey why is
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5006159,5012639,the broth a little bit green yeah from  the bowl oh thank god what is this one  this is a cheese oh it smells like
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5012639,5015440,parmesan

LYfVK0OjbBQ,5023280,5029159,little bit of a dip  and then try it out

LYfVK0OjbBQ,5054560,5060239,the chewy meat yeah but it's tasty so  when they cook rinse off they're gonna  feel the taste really yeah so they want
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5060239,5066239,to chill with the suck they look really  tasty that's what i thought that might  be the case it's like the flavor release
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5066239,5072239,crystals and extra gum the taste is good  it just happens to be very very chewy oh  hello oh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5072239,5077679,oh that's mine no that's mine i touched  it whoa
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5078960,5085840,all right  [Music]  oh wow these are great we'll clean these
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5085840,5092639,out  the intestines taste somewhat clean it's  like i can handle it but i just have  ptsd from eating that raw gastric acid
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5092639,5098639,and that's what it tastes like inside  here maybe i'm doing it wrong because  yes the intestines are quite intense but  everyone here they take the ugali and
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5098639,5104560,they kind of cut the taste with that  here she just handed me the broth now  this broth is from basically the boiled
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5104560,5111960,innards boiled beef all that together  oh that's actually quite nice
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5113199,5119840,really salty tons of animal fats it's  just like a deep delicious beef broth  the broth with the ugali combination
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5119840,5126080,that is pretty awesome it's quite  delicious probably my favorite thing so  far today  this place the differentiation and work
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5126080,5131520,between men and women it's fascinating  to me because in most tribes i go to the  men would slaughter the cow they would
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5131520,5137840,skin it they would butcher it but after  the slaughter here the women jump in  right away and the women seem to do a
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5137840,5141840,lot of work here for example
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5143310,5146399,[Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5151520,5157840,you know a long time ago men had  different traditional roles a hundred  years ago men were hunting animals men
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5157840,5164639,were protecting the village from lions  do they still do that they're still the  man protesting the village can see the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5164639,5170159,animals face there so the men they just  sleep near to the fair really the men
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5170159,5176800,sleep outside yeah they're sleeping  outside to take care of the enemy what  about when it rains  they have their cow's skin is very
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5176800,5181960,strong to protect them yeah oh my gosh
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5183679,5190080,me it looks like you guys have  everything here all the basic needs are  met but what's missing
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5190080,5196000,uh  for us now just only by call but if we  need it we take the cow we send to the
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5196000,5201120,local market we send it then we buy corn  so there's nothing missing no
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5201120,5206960,that's beautiful  sometimes people watching this show  mistake my casual way of interacting
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5206960,5212000,with locals for a lack of irreverence or  outright disrespect
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5212000,5217679,she knows the ministries reality can i  put my finger in there i'm never forced  to put on a fake display of deference
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5217679,5224000,for the simple reason that i don't pity  these people i've seen people here like  smile and laugh more than almost any
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5224000,5229199,other place i've gone in my life so it's  really remarkable it makes me happy to  know that places like this still exist
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5229199,5235679,in the world  [Applause]  the chaga
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5235679,5242320,the maasai  their lives are measurably different  from my own in almost every conceivable
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5242320,5248960,way but that doesn't make it worse or  better  it's just different  out here there's a beautiful sense of
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5248960,5256960,community a sisterhood where people are  truly connected there's fresh air mild  weather and one hell of a backyard view
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5256960,5263600,this is my last day to experience  tanzania and the only thing that makes  me feel pity is that as i go
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5263600,5267840,i can't take a piece of their lifestyle  with me
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5270070,5277199,[Music]
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5277199,5283120,guys that brings us to the end of our  video here with the toga people thank  you so much for watching i will see you  next time
LYfVK0OjbBQ,5283120,5289000,a peace  all right now i'm gonna hug one of these  donkeys
