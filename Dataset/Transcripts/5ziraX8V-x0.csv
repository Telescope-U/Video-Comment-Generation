5ziraX8V-x0,120,2399,"- Today, we are testing some TikTok tech tips"
5ziraX8V-x0,2400,4455,"with the tech tinker himself, Mr. Yeester."
5ziraX8V-x0,4455,6270,Are you ready to pour water onto hard drive?
5ziraX8V-x0,6270,7103,- Let's do it.
5ziraX8V-x0,7103,8689,"- Okay, here goes nothing."
5ziraX8V-x0,8689,11350,(cheering)
5ziraX8V-x0,11350,12183,- It's still working.
5ziraX8V-x0,12183,13379,- It's getting back to work.
5ziraX8V-x0,13380,15200,"It's trying. - That just evaporated,"
5ziraX8V-x0,15200,16860,soon it's spinning so fast.
5ziraX8V-x0,16860,17968,- [Both] It like sizzles.
5ziraX8V-x0,17968,18814,- So we're gonna see what happens
5ziraX8V-x0,18814,21500,when you put a marker on a running hard drive.
5ziraX8V-x0,21500,24290,"- Ooh, that's cool."
5ziraX8V-x0,24290,26030,"- Hey, you're just writing some custom data right"
5ziraX8V-x0,26030,27390,on hard drive.
5ziraX8V-x0,27390,32040,"- 1 0 1 1, should go without saying"
5ziraX8V-x0,32040,34238,but do not try this at home.
5ziraX8V-x0,34238,37245,(both laughing)
5ziraX8V-x0,37245,40050,We're just gonna unplug this real quick here.
5ziraX8V-x0,40050,43149,- So we were recording at 10 times slower
5ziraX8V-x0,43150,44200,than regular speed.
5ziraX8V-x0,44200,46720,So this is at 240 frames per second.
5ziraX8V-x0,46720,48947,(both cheering)
5ziraX8V-x0,48947,50460,- Do you see the water coming flying
5ziraX8V-x0,50460,51938,toward the lens? - That's so cool.
5ziraX8V-x0,51938,53364,(laughing loudly)
5ziraX8V-x0,53365,54860,And the thing about this is you can
5ziraX8V-x0,54860,57600,just recover this probably sell this hard drive on eBay.
5ziraX8V-x0,57600,58500,Who's gonna know?
5ziraX8V-x0,58500,61670,"- Oh my God, that's some villains."
5ziraX8V-x0,61670,62503,- Don't do that.
5ziraX8V-x0,62503,64259,- That's full like chaotic evil.
5ziraX8V-x0,64260,65890,So what happens if I try to like open something
5ziraX8V-x0,65890,66723,on a hard drive?
5ziraX8V-x0,66723,68220,How about I open up the OS Drive?
5ziraX8V-x0,68220,70050,"Oh, there you go."
5ziraX8V-x0,70050,71039,"- Oh, no, it's not working."
5ziraX8V-x0,71039,72950,(upbeat music)
5ziraX8V-x0,72950,74469,"No, okay, we killed the hard drive."
5ziraX8V-x0,74470,75370,(laughing loudly)
5ziraX8V-x0,75370,78060,"- For next, TikTok tech tip."
5ziraX8V-x0,78060,80329,We're gonna be using Flex Seal.
5ziraX8V-x0,80330,83840,The world famous liquid rubber ceiling coating.
5ziraX8V-x0,83840,85469,"- When I did this in a TikTok a little while ago,"
5ziraX8V-x0,85470,87600,I used a different hydrophobic spray
5ziraX8V-x0,87600,90110,as a way to try to waterproof a computer.
5ziraX8V-x0,90110,92323,And today we're trying with Flex Seal.
5ziraX8V-x0,93430,94407,"- Wow, that's really thick."
5ziraX8V-x0,94407,95574,- There we go.
5ziraX8V-x0,96610,97839,"I mean, it looks pretty cool."
5ziraX8V-x0,97839,99842,- I don't like how it bubbles after you hear it.
5ziraX8V-x0,99843,100980,- Bubbles a lot.
5ziraX8V-x0,100980,101813,"- Okay, so."
5ziraX8V-x0,101813,103660,- It's really covering up everything.
5ziraX8V-x0,103660,104647,Oh my goodness.
5ziraX8V-x0,104647,105651,And the reason we have all
5ziraX8V-x0,105651,107760,of the components already plugged in is
5ziraX8V-x0,107760,110850,because this flex spray is actually going to block all
5ziraX8V-x0,110850,112210,of our connective pads.
5ziraX8V-x0,112210,114810,"And so if we try to plug in each of these components,"
5ziraX8V-x0,114810,115960,"after we spray it on,"
5ziraX8V-x0,115960,118070,we're not gonna be able to get any connectivity.
5ziraX8V-x0,118070,120230,- So it has been 12 hours. - Give or take?
5ziraX8V-x0,120230,121700,- And it is time to see
5ziraX8V-x0,121700,123990,what monstrosity have we wraught.
5ziraX8V-x0,123990,125670,"Wow, that's thick."
5ziraX8V-x0,125670,127890,"- I mean, it has dried."
5ziraX8V-x0,127890,130039,- It is dry enough.
5ziraX8V-x0,130039,132560,"That actually looks, this looks like an art piece."
5ziraX8V-x0,132560,134520,- It does. - I think we did good.
5ziraX8V-x0,134520,136740,"- I'm gonna like, hang this up on my wall."
5ziraX8V-x0,136740,138630,"Afterwards, I think this is gonna work"
5ziraX8V-x0,138630,140470,as if it was out of the box.
5ziraX8V-x0,140470,142160,- I think it will probably fire up.
5ziraX8V-x0,142160,145530,The question I have is will the fan blade spin?
5ziraX8V-x0,145530,147250,"And because there's so much rubber on it,"
5ziraX8V-x0,147250,148750,it might just overheat.
5ziraX8V-x0,148750,150700,Some weird thing is just gonna overheat
5ziraX8V-x0,152210,153043,- I just spend life.
5ziraX8V-x0,153043,155047,"- Oh my God, is it actually? - They we go."
5ziraX8V-x0,155047,158047,(audience cheering)
5ziraX8V-x0,161295,162357,- Flex Seal for the win!
5ziraX8V-x0,162357,163840,- It's alive.
5ziraX8V-x0,163840,166263,"- Not only does it work, it's working fine, dude."
5ziraX8V-x0,166263,169264,- This might be the only PC that's ever been covered
5ziraX8V-x0,169264,170240,with the Flex Seal.
5ziraX8V-x0,170240,173200,"- We're well good point, world first."
5ziraX8V-x0,173200,174410,- This is working with flex seal
5ziraX8V-x0,174410,176320,but the point of flex seal is what?
5ziraX8V-x0,176320,178750,- Waterproofing. - The waterproofing.
5ziraX8V-x0,178750,181550,- Do not try this at home.
5ziraX8V-x0,181550,182890,Oh God.
5ziraX8V-x0,182890,184150,- It feels so wrong.
5ziraX8V-x0,184150,185239,- Look at beading up.
5ziraX8V-x0,185240,186460,"- Oh, flex seal."
5ziraX8V-x0,186460,188130,Shout out to flex seal.
5ziraX8V-x0,188130,189530,- I mean this is a running computer
5ziraX8V-x0,189530,191470,that we're spraying water.
5ziraX8V-x0,191470,194530,"If you sprayed water on this without the flex seal,"
5ziraX8V-x0,194530,196270,it would likely just have stopped working right away.
5ziraX8V-x0,196270,197300,- It would just immediately.
5ziraX8V-x0,197300,198382,"- Oh, what is that?"
5ziraX8V-x0,198382,200190,- USB device not recognized.
5ziraX8V-x0,200190,201840,So something on the board
5ziraX8V-x0,201840,202927,just stopped working with USB.
5ziraX8V-x0,202927,206050,- Interesting 'cause there's nothing USB plugged in.
5ziraX8V-x0,206050,206883,- No. - At all.
5ziraX8V-x0,206883,209319,"- One of the, maybe the control, oh, yep."
5ziraX8V-x0,209320,210420,"- USB devices are popping,"
5ziraX8V-x0,210420,212540,but it is still running right now.
5ziraX8V-x0,212540,214730,I think we should quit while we're ahead
5ziraX8V-x0,214730,217040,and immediately stop before something breaks.
5ziraX8V-x0,217040,219349,'Cause I feel like this was a wild success.
5ziraX8V-x0,219350,222030,I'm gonna now unplug this gently from the wall.
5ziraX8V-x0,222030,223830,"There we go, all, right. - Wow."
5ziraX8V-x0,223830,227270,- Successfully flex sealed and waterproofed a PC.
5ziraX8V-x0,229520,230870,"- Dude, that is awesome."
5ziraX8V-x0,230870,232650,- All a day's work. - Well done.
5ziraX8V-x0,232650,234890,- Next up we have what should be a simple challenge?
5ziraX8V-x0,234890,238400,- Can we find cash hidden inside gaming PCs?
5ziraX8V-x0,238400,242360,"- A little while ago, I hid a $100 bill inside of a CPU"
5ziraX8V-x0,242360,245300,which I personally think is the best hiding spot for this.
5ziraX8V-x0,245300,247590,"Three, two, one, go."
5ziraX8V-x0,247590,249709,"Okay, so it's gonna start with this one"
5ziraX8V-x0,249710,252700,and as plug this right here.
5ziraX8V-x0,252700,254040,"Oh no, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
5ziraX8V-x0,254040,255491,So this one is gonna go right here.
5ziraX8V-x0,255491,257450,(cheering)
5ziraX8V-x0,257450,259440,"Cool, alright that one's done."
5ziraX8V-x0,259440,261963,"This one, I'm gonna put right here."
5ziraX8V-x0,261963,263560,This feels like a good spot.
5ziraX8V-x0,263560,267000,If it will go in which it will.
5ziraX8V-x0,267000,269233,- 30 seconds left. - Uh oh that doesn't fit there.
5ziraX8V-x0,269233,270090,"Okay, I'm gonna go back to that one."
5ziraX8V-x0,270090,271432,"Nope, nope, I won't, okay."
5ziraX8V-x0,272924,274653,- 20 seconds left.
5ziraX8V-x0,274653,275917,(laughing)
5ziraX8V-x0,275917,278120,"- Okay, okay, okay, okay, that's not good."
5ziraX8V-x0,278120,278953,That's not good.
5ziraX8V-x0,278953,280923,"Okay, I'm gonna put that one there."
5ziraX8V-x0,280923,281756,- 10 seconds.
5ziraX8V-x0,281756,283147,"- Okay, 10 seconds, 10 seconds, 10 seconds,"
5ziraX8V-x0,283147,285000,"10 seconds, 10 seconds, 10 seconds,"
5ziraX8V-x0,285000,285930,"10 seconds, 10 seconds."
5ziraX8V-x0,285930,290930,"- Five, four, three, two, one, time."
5ziraX8V-x0,291340,293560,"- Time, all right, I did, I did, I did, okay."
5ziraX8V-x0,293560,295710,"I will be over here, I will have the 60 second counter."
5ziraX8V-x0,295710,300259,"- Three, two, one, begin."
5ziraX8V-x0,300260,303070,"- Oh my gosh, 60 seconds is not a lot of time."
5ziraX8V-x0,303070,304320,I might have tried a hundred.
5ziraX8V-x0,304320,307030,Hide the hundred dollars bill first
5ziraX8V-x0,307030,308100,- 40 seconds.
5ziraX8V-x0,308100,309720,- Oh my goodness.
5ziraX8V-x0,309720,314470,"- 30, 8, 7, 6,"
5ziraX8V-x0,314470,319280,"5, 4, 3, 2, 1."
5ziraX8V-x0,319280,320360,- That was not a lot of time.
5ziraX8V-x0,320360,323189,So I'm only a little confident.
5ziraX8V-x0,323190,325050,- Play Rock Paper Scissors to see who goes first.
5ziraX8V-x0,325050,327639,- Okay. - Rock Paper Scissors.
5ziraX8V-x0,327640,328473,"- Okay, you get to go first."
5ziraX8V-x0,328473,330020,"- All right, one minute on the clock."
5ziraX8V-x0,330020,331319,Are you ready? - I'm ready?
5ziraX8V-x0,331320,332833,"- Set, begin!"
5ziraX8V-x0,332833,336000,"- All right, all panels open, that's a good sign."
5ziraX8V-x0,336000,338830,See where I can find right now. There's a $5 bill.
5ziraX8V-x0,338830,340500,Easy peasy.
5ziraX8V-x0,340500,341920,I don't see a lot else though.
5ziraX8V-x0,341920,344100,"I do see money, but I can't reach it."
5ziraX8V-x0,344100,346580,"- Oh, oh, that seems like a problem."
5ziraX8V-x0,346580,347810,"- Oh, here's a $1 bill."
5ziraX8V-x0,347810,348886,- Okay. - All right.
5ziraX8V-x0,348886,349719,- 40 seconds.
5ziraX8V-x0,349719,352990,"- All right, I'm actually not seeing the last bill."
5ziraX8V-x0,352990,354180,"Oh, in the world is it?"
5ziraX8V-x0,354180,355160,That's a good hiding spot.
5ziraX8V-x0,355160,356510,- You have 24 seconds.
5ziraX8V-x0,356510,358010,"- Oh my good, oh, I found it."
5ziraX8V-x0,358010,358843,It's right back here.
5ziraX8V-x0,358843,359676,I can't get that either.
5ziraX8V-x0,359676,361430,(laughing)
5ziraX8V-x0,361430,362281,Yes I can.
5ziraX8V-x0,362282,364615,(cheering)
5ziraX8V-x0,366660,368150,My fingers are too big.
5ziraX8V-x0,368150,369600,"- 10 seconds, 10 seconds."
5ziraX8V-x0,369600,372253,"Nine, eight, seven, six."
5ziraX8V-x0,372253,373931,(cheering)
5ziraX8V-x0,373931,374764,- No.
5ziraX8V-x0,374764,375950,- I got it all.
5ziraX8V-x0,375950,377180,I got it all.
5ziraX8V-x0,377180,381440,- So my best case scenario is I find all of your money
5ziraX8V-x0,381440,382273,and I tie.
5ziraX8V-x0,382273,383280,"- Wow, all right."
5ziraX8V-x0,383280,386570,"Three , two, one, go!"
5ziraX8V-x0,386570,391570,"- Okay, so, one, two, there, okay."
5ziraX8V-x0,391580,393770,I see money right here.
5ziraX8V-x0,393770,394603,"And oh, you're right."
5ziraX8V-x0,394603,395550,That's really hard to get.
5ziraX8V-x0,395550,398206,"Oh no, it fell, it fell, hang on."
5ziraX8V-x0,398206,399722,I've got a dollar bill.
5ziraX8V-x0,399722,401810,I also see it's 20 right here.
5ziraX8V-x0,401810,403120,"Okay, so I've got two."
5ziraX8V-x0,403120,404729,"Oh, I see a five right here."
5ziraX8V-x0,404730,405748,"Three, all right."
5ziraX8V-x0,405748,406770,I'm missing the hundred.
5ziraX8V-x0,406770,408620,"Where's the hundred, behind the motherboard."
5ziraX8V-x0,408620,409520,- 30 seconds.
5ziraX8V-x0,409520,411069,"- All right, where's the hundred?"
5ziraX8V-x0,411070,411903,Where's the hundred?
5ziraX8V-x0,411903,412823,- It's the one you want?
5ziraX8V-x0,412823,415090,"- It's the one I want, my only shot here."
5ziraX8V-x0,415090,416600,"Fan, fan"
5ziraX8V-x0,416600,418160,- 20 seconds.
5ziraX8V-x0,418160,420323,"- It's not here, it's not here, no."
5ziraX8V-x0,421297,422320,(laughing)
5ziraX8V-x0,422320,424673,"No, no. - 10 seconds."
5ziraX8V-x0,425560,430343,"Five, four, three, two, one!"
5ziraX8V-x0,433160,434429,- Where was it?
5ziraX8V-x0,434429,436103,Where was it? - The CPU.
5ziraX8V-x0,437140,442140,"- Oh my dude, that is, oh, wow."
5ziraX8V-x0,442300,443460,"- I like this game, we should play more."
5ziraX8V-x0,443460,445360,- Go back to TikTok already.
5ziraX8V-x0,445360,447830,So Adam did a video
5ziraX8V-x0,447830,451970,"on how to correctly drive, would be the right way to put it?"
5ziraX8V-x0,451970,454950,So I trust my skills.
5ziraX8V-x0,454950,456360,Do you trust my skills?
5ziraX8V-x0,456360,457500,"- I do, I believe in you."
5ziraX8V-x0,457500,459050,- I get some practice in first.
5ziraX8V-x0,461160,462350,"So I'll get it, it's fine."
5ziraX8V-x0,462350,463286,I've just gotta warm up.
5ziraX8V-x0,463286,465700,(upbeat music)
5ziraX8V-x0,465700,467220,So slightly missed that one.
5ziraX8V-x0,467220,468400,Practice makes perfect.
5ziraX8V-x0,468400,470169,- You're using your pointer finger.
5ziraX8V-x0,470170,472520,"- No, no, that's not it."
5ziraX8V-x0,472520,473910,"All right, Charles Barkley."
5ziraX8V-x0,473910,475526,"- Oh, here we go, oh, see, already"
5ziraX8V-x0,475526,476800,- Don't they call that a chip shot.
5ziraX8V-x0,476800,478767,"I'm ready for real, I'm ready for real."
5ziraX8V-x0,478768,481351,(upbeat music)
5ziraX8V-x0,483324,485574,(laughing)
5ziraX8V-x0,489412,490245,Thank you for watching.
5ziraX8V-x0,490245,491440,Make sure to subscribe.
5ziraX8V-x0,491440,492570,Go check out Adam's channel.
5ziraX8V-x0,492570,495210,So with a high quality Mr. Yeester video playing.
5ziraX8V-x0,495210,496457,Next up we're gonna try something
5ziraX8V-x0,496457,497850,that I've seen you do in the past.
5ziraX8V-x0,497850,500130,Which is to remove the RAM while it's running.
5ziraX8V-x0,500130,501440,So I'm just gonna do it.
5ziraX8V-x0,501440,502532,- Go for it.
5ziraX8V-x0,502532,503620,(cheering)
5ziraX8V-x0,503620,506490,"- Okay, so. - That's awesome."
5ziraX8V-x0,506490,508500,"- Is it, I mean, it's modern."
5ziraX8V-x0,508500,510900,"At this point, the computer should be inaccessible."
5ziraX8V-x0,510900,513469,- What happens if I get rid of the other stick of RAM?
5ziraX8V-x0,513469,514302,- Let's find out.
5ziraX8V-x0,514302,515680,(cheering)
5ziraX8V-x0,515680,516513,- Wow.
5ziraX8V-x0,516513,517990,- Do you think plugging them back in
5ziraX8V-x0,517990,520860,will just fix the problem while it's still running?
5ziraX8V-x0,520860,521842,- Let's find out.
5ziraX8V-x0,523310,524840,"Okay, so nothing on that one, right?"
5ziraX8V-x0,524840,527640,"Oh, I might have switched the sticks of RAM though."
5ziraX8V-x0,527640,529513,My video's leaking into the other.
5ziraX8V-x0,531200,532820,"- Nope, no bueno."
5ziraX8V-x0,532820,535940,- The experiment here is if you bend a pin
5ziraX8V-x0,535940,539670,on your CPU socket are you just immediately gonna
5ziraX8V-x0,539670,540850,just have a huge problem
5ziraX8V-x0,540850,543319,or is there some scenario
5ziraX8V-x0,543320,545570,in which a bent pin will not cause you major problems?
5ziraX8V-x0,545570,546610,- There's a lot of different pins
5ziraX8V-x0,546610,548260,that have a lot of different roles.
5ziraX8V-x0,548260,550720,"Hopefully, we can cut one that isn't important."
5ziraX8V-x0,550720,552769,- I think somewhere between most
5ziraX8V-x0,552770,554240,"and all of them are important, but maybe there's a couple"
5ziraX8V-x0,554240,555423,and we'll get lucky.
5ziraX8V-x0,556600,559120,"Dude, this is, I mean, I can really push this"
5ziraX8V-x0,559120,562040,if I want these pins are way more durable than I thought.
5ziraX8V-x0,562040,562873,- There we go.
5ziraX8V-x0,562873,564040,"- Oh, that's okay."
5ziraX8V-x0,564040,566839,"So we got, oh, so you know what else though?"
5ziraX8V-x0,566840,567673,I didn't think about this.
5ziraX8V-x0,567673,568870,"So when you do that,"
5ziraX8V-x0,568870,570150,"not only does that mess up that pin,"
5ziraX8V-x0,570150,571856,it mess all the pins around it because oh.
5ziraX8V-x0,571856,574120,- The connective pads might be touching different pins.
5ziraX8V-x0,574120,576080,"- Like four or five pins, oh, that'll."
5ziraX8V-x0,576080,576913,So there's no way this is gonna work out.
5ziraX8V-x0,576913,577770,There's no way.
5ziraX8V-x0,577770,580110,"- Well, a lot of this video's not particularly practical"
5ziraX8V-x0,580110,582000,but it's interesting to learn this stuff
5ziraX8V-x0,582000,584053,so that you don't have to do it yourself.
5ziraX8V-x0,586177,587400,"- Oh, you have a second."
5ziraX8V-x0,587400,588676,"- Okay, that's a way better sound."
5ziraX8V-x0,588676,590320,- We've got lights over here.
5ziraX8V-x0,590320,591690,"- Let's go, okay."
5ziraX8V-x0,591690,592890,But can we get a signal?
5ziraX8V-x0,593760,598070,"- Well, you win some, you lose some"
5ziraX8V-x0,598070,600020,"- Today, we lost the pin lottery."
5ziraX8V-x0,600020,601650,"That's okay, we can always play again next time."
5ziraX8V-x0,601650,604060,"- So you did a TikTok, not too long ago,"
5ziraX8V-x0,604060,606980,showing how to turn your phone into a gaming setup.
5ziraX8V-x0,606980,610139,"- Well, I really just plugged a USB-C adapter"
5ziraX8V-x0,610140,613430,"into my old Android phone, plugged some more accessories"
5ziraX8V-x0,613430,615220,into that and it really just came to life.
5ziraX8V-x0,615220,619110,- So today I have a Samsung Galaxy S22.
5ziraX8V-x0,619110,620680,This phone particularly
5ziraX8V-x0,620680,622610,"because as much as I love the Z Flip,"
5ziraX8V-x0,622610,624649,"it is missing a very important feature,"
5ziraX8V-x0,624650,626180,Samsung DeX.
5ziraX8V-x0,626180,630060,"- Fun fact on iOS, this is not particularly usable."
5ziraX8V-x0,630060,632480,You can kind of get HDMI if you use an adapter
5ziraX8V-x0,632480,633860,but no games will support.
5ziraX8V-x0,633860,635010,It's just not gonna work very well.
5ziraX8V-x0,635010,636530,"So with just a mouse and keyboard plugged in,"
5ziraX8V-x0,636530,638100,I have a mouse cursor that's available
5ziraX8V-x0,638100,640615,on my Android phone so I can use it to swipe through.
5ziraX8V-x0,640616,642640,And the keyboard works as well.
5ziraX8V-x0,642640,644680,So I plug in my monitor.
5ziraX8V-x0,644680,645706,"- Oh, and just like that."
5ziraX8V-x0,645706,646779,- There it is. - It comes to life.
5ziraX8V-x0,646780,648790,"- And so with this, I do a bunch of stuff, right."
5ziraX8V-x0,648790,650230,"So if I want, I can open up an app"
5ziraX8V-x0,650230,651930,and see I can pick up exactly where I left off.
5ziraX8V-x0,651930,654350,"Previously, Android apps were kind resizable"
5ziraX8V-x0,654350,655183,but not really.
5ziraX8V-x0,655183,657589,But because basically every Android app is optimized.
5ziraX8V-x0,657590,659610,At least most of them are optimized for Chrome OS.
5ziraX8V-x0,659610,662870,You actually can have properly like usable apps
5ziraX8V-x0,662870,663850,and you see it.
5ziraX8V-x0,663850,665649,Performance is really not bad at all.
5ziraX8V-x0,665650,670190,"So with this, we can turn our phone into a proper gaming PC."
5ziraX8V-x0,670190,671397,"- Wait, then why do you have,"
5ziraX8V-x0,671397,673147,where do you have a PC right there?
5ziraX8V-x0,674320,675370,- Where?
5ziraX8V-x0,675370,677910,"- So the one, the big old, the big."
5ziraX8V-x0,677910,681230,- I'll immediately say this is very nice.
5ziraX8V-x0,681230,682620,- That's even like 60 FPS.
5ziraX8V-x0,682620,683529,That's pretty smooth.
5ziraX8V-x0,683530,684570,- We've got 60 FPS.
5ziraX8V-x0,684570,686530,Now we are running at only 1080p
5ziraX8V-x0,686530,688170,which is one of the limitations of DeX.
5ziraX8V-x0,688170,689839,Unless I think you may be able to go higher.
5ziraX8V-x0,689840,690910,I think 1440 or something.
5ziraX8V-x0,690910,692589,If you buy one of these Samsung docks
5ziraX8V-x0,692590,694570,but I'm just using a completely generic dock.
5ziraX8V-x0,694570,695408,The only caveat
5ziraX8V-x0,695408,696900,that you really need to keep in mind with this.
5ziraX8V-x0,696900,699320,Some Android apps and specifically
5ziraX8V-x0,699320,700380,"when it comes to games,"
5ziraX8V-x0,700380,701860,do not want you to do this.
5ziraX8V-x0,701860,702693,Pretty much entirely
5ziraX8V-x0,702693,704300,because they don't want you to cheat.
5ziraX8V-x0,704300,705380,"So, certain games,"
5ziraX8V-x0,705380,707010,if they detect a mouse and keyboard plugged
5ziraX8V-x0,707010,709860,"into your device, will straight up ban you instantly."
5ziraX8V-x0,709860,711790,So do at your own risk.
5ziraX8V-x0,711790,713529,"However, assuming that my phone"
5ziraX8V-x0,713530,715140,"is not a million degrees right now,"
5ziraX8V-x0,715140,719470,this you could tell me is running on a low-end PC.
5ziraX8V-x0,719470,721149,And I would not question it
5ziraX8V-x0,721150,722320,"- Dude, oh my goodness."
5ziraX8V-x0,722320,723440,"Oh my God, Austin."
5ziraX8V-x0,723440,724630,- You're too stupid to breed.
5ziraX8V-x0,724630,725730,You're too stupid to live.
5ziraX8V-x0,725730,726579,- You actually know what happens
5ziraX8V-x0,726580,727790,if you try to use this phone
5ziraX8V-x0,727790,730420,while it's also playing DeX. - I have no idea try it.
5ziraX8V-x0,730420,731620,- It seems like I can.
5ziraX8V-x0,731620,732643,Oh my goodness.
5ziraX8V-x0,733800,735779,Your keyboard is now typing in here as well.
5ziraX8V-x0,735780,737630,"- Okay, so maybe don't touch the phone."
5ziraX8V-x0,737630,738633,- You've broken it.
5ziraX8V-x0,738633,740102,- Give me an example again.
5ziraX8V-x0,740970,741803,Oh my God.
5ziraX8V-x0,741803,744459,- It's controlling both the screen and it's typing.
5ziraX8V-x0,744460,746377,There's a few caveats to this apparently.
5ziraX8V-x0,746377,747771,(upbeat music)
