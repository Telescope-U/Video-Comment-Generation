8N5wssPlSdE,450,1283,(camera smashes)
8N5wssPlSdE,1283,2730,- Ooh-oh.
8N5wssPlSdE,2730,6060,- We're back with another Intel extreme tech upgrade
8N5wssPlSdE,6060,9510,and this time we are gonna be laser-focused.
8N5wssPlSdE,9510,14510,"Intel has provided our cameraman, David, with $5,000 US"
8N5wssPlSdE,14800,18620,and he has decided to laser-focus his budget
8N5wssPlSdE,18620,21250,"on ultimate media enjoyment,"
8N5wssPlSdE,21250,22690,"extreme gaming,"
8N5wssPlSdE,22690,25110,streaming and data hoarding.
8N5wssPlSdE,25110,28090,How on earth did you do all of that within this budget?
8N5wssPlSdE,28090,29900,- It's not even close to the budget.
8N5wssPlSdE,29900,33013,"- This is a $2,500 US webcam."
8N5wssPlSdE,34687,37270,(upbeat music)
8N5wssPlSdE,47788,51121,(relaxing upbeat music)
8N5wssPlSdE,56400,59920,"David, can I just say that you are a man after my own heart?"
8N5wssPlSdE,59920,62780,You've got the sick water-cooled gaming rig
8N5wssPlSdE,62780,66740,"and what appears to be a leftover piece of,"
8N5wssPlSdE,66740,68507,two leftover pieces
8N5wssPlSdE,68507,69530,(laughing)
8N5wssPlSdE,69530,72720,of hardie board that make up your desk.
8N5wssPlSdE,72720,75084,Because if it doesn't contribute to performance-
8N5wssPlSdE,75084,77270,- Why would I spend any money on it?
8N5wssPlSdE,77270,79439,"- Thank you, you finished my sentence."
8N5wssPlSdE,79440,80780,"Also, can I just say for a moment,"
8N5wssPlSdE,80780,82390,that I love your flacid handles here?
8N5wssPlSdE,82390,83320,- Oh yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,83320,85566,"If I ever feel emasculated, I just come over here."
8N5wssPlSdE,85566,87220,I feel better about myself.
8N5wssPlSdE,87220,88110,"- I gotta say, David,"
8N5wssPlSdE,88110,91360,this is one hell of an LMG (beep) mix special right here.
8N5wssPlSdE,91360,93577,I recognize pretty much all of these parts.
8N5wssPlSdE,93577,94540,(laughing)
8N5wssPlSdE,94540,99164,You got that old weird ZOTAC 1080 Ti like mini thing.
8N5wssPlSdE,99164,99997,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,99997,101684,- And then that in-wind comentered well under-
8N5wssPlSdE,101684,103119,- [David] I got that from NCIX.
8N5wssPlSdE,103120,104360,"- That's right, we did."
8N5wssPlSdE,104360,106660,We brought in a bunch of them for like 60 bucks.
8N5wssPlSdE,106660,107493,- [David] That's why I got it.
8N5wssPlSdE,107493,108326,It was so cheap.
8N5wssPlSdE,108326,109566,- So you probably paid next to nothing for it.
8N5wssPlSdE,109567,110740,- [David] Yep.
8N5wssPlSdE,110740,112900,- That's why I recognized it.
8N5wssPlSdE,112900,116250,"- [David] Yeah, that's the glitter case from LTX whenever."
8N5wssPlSdE,116250,118142,"- Oh, so it is."
8N5wssPlSdE,118142,119009,So it is.
8N5wssPlSdE,119010,120400,- [David] Not much glitter left though.
8N5wssPlSdE,120400,122520,"- There's no way you're changing this keyboard though,"
8N5wssPlSdE,122520,123353,right?
8N5wssPlSdE,123353,124186,- It's a great keyboard.
8N5wssPlSdE,124186,125019,I wanna go wireless.
8N5wssPlSdE,125019,126890,I couldn't fit the 915 TKL on my budget
8N5wssPlSdE,126890,128319,but my birthday is coming up.
8N5wssPlSdE,128320,130039,So I might buy it for myself.
8N5wssPlSdE,130039,132799,"- G43, great bang for the buck,"
8N5wssPlSdE,132800,134160,"but you're going G pro, aren't you?"
8N5wssPlSdE,134160,135860,- [David] G pro X baby. - Super light power.
8N5wssPlSdE,135860,139080,"Yeah, let's go have a look at his hall."
8N5wssPlSdE,139080,141230,"I mean, I guess this kind of makes the point"
8N5wssPlSdE,141230,142179,of how much space this has been taking up
8N5wssPlSdE,142179,145700,in your house for weeks now. (laughing)
8N5wssPlSdE,145700,146890,It's taken us a little while
8N5wssPlSdE,146890,148750,to get David's rig on the schedule.
8N5wssPlSdE,148750,152770,"So he's just had to have this sitting, staring at him,"
8N5wssPlSdE,152770,154710,including an RTX 3080.
8N5wssPlSdE,154710,156900,So why don't we go through the highlights?
8N5wssPlSdE,156900,160310,The RTX 3080 is one of the things in your Intel 5k budget
8N5wssPlSdE,160310,161340,"right? - [David] Yes, absolutely."
8N5wssPlSdE,161340,164459,"- Along with the Pro X mouse, powerplay mouse pad,"
8N5wssPlSdE,164460,166200,a define 7XL computer case
8N5wssPlSdE,166200,168330,"that you're gonna be turning into a rocking NAS,"
8N5wssPlSdE,168330,169953,how much storage are you gonna have and why do you need it?
8N5wssPlSdE,169953,172800,- It's gonna be about 20 terabytes.
8N5wssPlSdE,172800,174730,And I need it because I want to do more streaming
8N5wssPlSdE,174730,175562,and make more videos.
8N5wssPlSdE,175563,176730,But the last time I did it
8N5wssPlSdE,176730,179409,I ran out of SSD space so quickly.
8N5wssPlSdE,179410,181450,And I just started moving stuff around on SSDs
8N5wssPlSdE,181450,182282,and it was a pain
8N5wssPlSdE,182283,184350,and I just got too tired and never finished the video.
8N5wssPlSdE,184350,185440,"- Okay, fair enough."
8N5wssPlSdE,185440,188540,So we're going with Ironwolf NAS drives for that.
8N5wssPlSdE,188540,190939,Why do we need this much water cooling gear?
8N5wssPlSdE,190940,192120,- I already have a water-cooled system
8N5wssPlSdE,192120,193788,but this system will also be water-cooled.
8N5wssPlSdE,193788,196560,"- Good Lord, you're water-cooling your NAS?"
8N5wssPlSdE,196560,198897,Or more accurately I'm water-cooling your NAS.
8N5wssPlSdE,199827,201319,- (laughing) All the problems are handed off.
8N5wssPlSdE,201320,202410,"- Naturally for the NAS,"
8N5wssPlSdE,202410,205060,"we're going Intel with a core I3, 10100 K."
8N5wssPlSdE,205060,206739,"This has four cores, eight threads,"
8N5wssPlSdE,206740,209320,"which like, damn, I3s have gotten good."
8N5wssPlSdE,209320,210429,"- Yeah, seriously."
8N5wssPlSdE,210429,213080,- Obviously plenty for a NAS.
8N5wssPlSdE,213080,214780,And then it's easy to miss
8N5wssPlSdE,214780,216480,because it's covered in other stuff.
8N5wssPlSdE,216480,220909,But how the hell did you get a 48 inch LGC 10 OLED
8N5wssPlSdE,220910,221760,into the budget.
8N5wssPlSdE,221760,223409,"- Magic money, baby."
8N5wssPlSdE,223410,225400,"- So if you guys haven't figured it out yet,"
8N5wssPlSdE,225400,228060,David contributed some of his own funds
8N5wssPlSdE,228060,230819,to this complete tech make-over.
8N5wssPlSdE,230820,233410,Meaning that this is going to take us a while.
8N5wssPlSdE,233410,234970,"- Yeah, you can build a computer in 17 minutes."
8N5wssPlSdE,234970,235898,Can't you?
8N5wssPlSdE,235898,238000,- This is water cooling though.
8N5wssPlSdE,238000,239470,And we have to do maintenance
8N5wssPlSdE,239470,242680,on his existing water-cooled rig to put the new card in.
8N5wssPlSdE,242680,246030,And I haven't even shown you guys the custom tabletop
8N5wssPlSdE,246030,249340,that David and Nicholas finished up last night.
8N5wssPlSdE,249340,250172,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,250173,251006,- That's gonna be replacing...
8N5wssPlSdE,251006,252489,this is a necessary upgrade dude.
8N5wssPlSdE,252490,254470,This looks so nice.
8N5wssPlSdE,254470,255303,- Right?
8N5wssPlSdE,255303,256135,It's gonna be awesome.
8N5wssPlSdE,256135,259180,What I'm thinking is we take down the setup there.
8N5wssPlSdE,259180,260530,We can put the wood on this table.
8N5wssPlSdE,260530,262230,You can start building computers there.
8N5wssPlSdE,262230,263246,- Yes.
8N5wssPlSdE,263246,264079,"- I'll then build the legs,"
8N5wssPlSdE,264079,264912,get the table ready.
8N5wssPlSdE,264912,266479,And then we can transfer all the building into there.
8N5wssPlSdE,266480,267313,Get it all done
8N5wssPlSdE,267313,268231,"- While we're at it,"
8N5wssPlSdE,268231,269064,you want me to paint any walls?
8N5wssPlSdE,269064,272910,"- Yeah, that one up there sounds pretty good."
8N5wssPlSdE,272910,276060,"- Oh man, like this mouse pad, (David laughing)"
8N5wssPlSdE,276060,278500,there has got to be like three pounds of dead skin
8N5wssPlSdE,278500,279333,in the surface.
8N5wssPlSdE,279333,280343,"- [David] Oh, at least,"
8N5wssPlSdE,280343,281653,that's been through a washing machine.
8N5wssPlSdE,281653,283160,"- Oh, really? (David laughing)"
8N5wssPlSdE,283160,284260,"- Yeah, I have dirty hands."
8N5wssPlSdE,284260,287210,- [Linus] This is gonna look absolutely sick.
8N5wssPlSdE,287210,288334,"- Oh, I know."
8N5wssPlSdE,288334,289167,I'm so excited.
8N5wssPlSdE,290280,291800,"- [Andy] Oh, did you just use book?"
8N5wssPlSdE,291800,292923,- Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,292924,295850,"So it's a bunch of Harry Potter books,"
8N5wssPlSdE,295850,296940,but then my high school year books
8N5wssPlSdE,296940,299300,I'm gonna put those away before Linus finds them.
8N5wssPlSdE,299300,300550,- What's that?
8N5wssPlSdE,300550,303000,"Wait a minute, is that what was propping up your desk?"
8N5wssPlSdE,303000,304690,"- Yep, just Harry Potter books."
8N5wssPlSdE,304690,306540,"- Wait, what other books were there?"
8N5wssPlSdE,306540,309670,Oh my God. (David laughing)
8N5wssPlSdE,309670,310836,"- [David] Oh, no."
8N5wssPlSdE,310836,313320,"- [Linus] Yeah, that is like a bull mullet."
8N5wssPlSdE,313320,314153,"- Yeah, it's bad."
8N5wssPlSdE,314153,316050,"- Wait, where the heck is the TV going?"
8N5wssPlSdE,316050,316883,- On the wall.
8N5wssPlSdE,316883,317930,I have a wall now.
8N5wssPlSdE,317930,318763,- Like in there?
8N5wssPlSdE,318763,319596,- Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,319596,320429,- That's your gaming display.
8N5wssPlSdE,320429,321909,- Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,321910,325470,I would say I have the sickest setup of anyone ever.
8N5wssPlSdE,325470,327920,It's gonna be so bonkers. - Okay.
8N5wssPlSdE,327920,328753,All right.
8N5wssPlSdE,328753,329586,"Well, let's do it then."
8N5wssPlSdE,329586,331270,"So we've got an RTX 3080,"
8N5wssPlSdE,331270,334560,basically freaking top of the line for David's rig here.
8N5wssPlSdE,334560,335550,This one's pretty unique.
8N5wssPlSdE,335550,338129,It can actually do up to three HDMI outputs
8N5wssPlSdE,338130,340717,and up to three display port 1.4s.
8N5wssPlSdE,340717,343330,"And of course, because it's water blocked,"
8N5wssPlSdE,343330,346900,we are going to be maximum turbo all the time.
8N5wssPlSdE,346900,348827,"But we've got a bit of a problem, David."
8N5wssPlSdE,348827,349840,- [David] Okay.
8N5wssPlSdE,349840,351730,- So I thought this was gonna be relatively simple.
8N5wssPlSdE,351730,353800,"Pop out the old card, pop the new one in,"
8N5wssPlSdE,353800,356900,"but, who built this water cooling setup for you?"
8N5wssPlSdE,356900,358210,- Me and Ivan together.
8N5wssPlSdE,358210,359050,And John and Ed.
8N5wssPlSdE,359050,359883,We were all there.
8N5wssPlSdE,359883,364150,"- Okay, well you guys hooked up your CPU block backwards."
8N5wssPlSdE,364150,366460,- Oops. (laughing)
8N5wssPlSdE,366460,368240,- And also this is zip tied.
8N5wssPlSdE,368240,369610,Why is this zip tied?
8N5wssPlSdE,369610,370443,- [David] Zip tie's faster.
8N5wssPlSdE,370443,371276,It's better.
8N5wssPlSdE,371276,373240,"- [Linus] Is this mismatched tubing, David?"
8N5wssPlSdE,373240,374759,"- Uh huh, I have more tubing though."
8N5wssPlSdE,374760,376180,So we can use that if you want.
8N5wssPlSdE,376180,377530,And lots more fittings.
8N5wssPlSdE,377530,378480,- Oh God.
8N5wssPlSdE,378480,379690,Oh boy.
8N5wssPlSdE,379690,381480,- [David] I have two pets and lots of carpets.
8N5wssPlSdE,381480,383610,So that's probably like five days worth of dust.
8N5wssPlSdE,383610,385210,- I cannot see through it.
8N5wssPlSdE,385210,386220,This is gonna be tough.
8N5wssPlSdE,386220,389110,I've got five hours to fix this water cooling
8N5wssPlSdE,389110,391849,and build a completely separate water-cooled system.
8N5wssPlSdE,391850,394430,To get an idea of what standard of quality
8N5wssPlSdE,394430,395810,"the client expects,"
8N5wssPlSdE,395810,396850,all you really have to do
8N5wssPlSdE,396850,400559,is take a look at their own workmanship that's around you.
8N5wssPlSdE,400559,401392,(David laughing)
8N5wssPlSdE,401392,404610,So I'm thinking the bar is gonna be pretty low here.
8N5wssPlSdE,404610,407229,"- So I bought these prime cable,"
8N5wssPlSdE,407230,408610,the L-shaped desk legs.
8N5wssPlSdE,408610,409509,I want to be able to adjust.
8N5wssPlSdE,409510,412890,There's like a sweet spot of like up high leaning forward
8N5wssPlSdE,412890,415808,where I have optimal speed reflexes.
8N5wssPlSdE,415808,418220,(gun firing)
8N5wssPlSdE,418220,420680,"- You want me to put that new radiator in, hey?"
8N5wssPlSdE,420680,422240,"- [David] Yeah, if you can, that'd be awesome."
8N5wssPlSdE,422240,424410,"- You don't happen to have any like hardware for that rad,"
8N5wssPlSdE,424410,425243,do you?
8N5wssPlSdE,425243,426620,"- Yeah, I had a bag of screws."
8N5wssPlSdE,426620,427780,It's a bit of a mix.
8N5wssPlSdE,427780,429290,I got the radiators from the office
8N5wssPlSdE,429290,430240,but they didn't come with hardware.
8N5wssPlSdE,430240,432310,"So I was like, I better get some screws for this video."
8N5wssPlSdE,432310,434280,- And did you just grab a handful of random-
8N5wssPlSdE,434280,435113,- Sure did.
8N5wssPlSdE,436590,438169,- I could have helped you find the correct-
8N5wssPlSdE,438170,440053,- It wouldn't be a good video if it wasn't a challenge.
8N5wssPlSdE,440990,443990,- Most of these aren't even threaded right for this.
8N5wssPlSdE,443990,446490,It's a good thing any screw is a self-tapper
8N5wssPlSdE,446490,447630,if you press hard enough.
8N5wssPlSdE,447630,448610,- Heck yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,448610,450949,I am not the most handy person.
8N5wssPlSdE,450950,453770,So this is gonna be a challenge and a half.
8N5wssPlSdE,453770,454889,But I'm gonna do my best.
8N5wssPlSdE,454890,455920,Full credit to Alpha Cool
8N5wssPlSdE,455920,457620,"for the quality of their materials,"
8N5wssPlSdE,457620,460280,but I'm having a real hard time here.
8N5wssPlSdE,460280,465120,My screws are stripping as I try to kind of self tap them
8N5wssPlSdE,465120,467699,into these smaller holes and they're getting stuck.
8N5wssPlSdE,467700,469610,This thing is solid boys.
8N5wssPlSdE,469610,470443,- Oh yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,470443,471550,- Watch your step.
8N5wssPlSdE,471550,472383,Ouch.
8N5wssPlSdE,472383,473350,"- You're okay? - Yeah, I hit the wall."
8N5wssPlSdE,473350,474183,I'm fine.
8N5wssPlSdE,474183,475016,My butt's very paddy.
8N5wssPlSdE,475016,477069,What an improvement.
8N5wssPlSdE,477070,478280,- It's a little bit nicer.
8N5wssPlSdE,478280,479550,"- All right, now I just got to figure out"
8N5wssPlSdE,479550,480940,how to get that radiator in there.
8N5wssPlSdE,480940,483639,I'm considering drilling the radiator.
8N5wssPlSdE,483639,485341,(drill whirring)
8N5wssPlSdE,485341,486174,It shouldn't be that hard.
8N5wssPlSdE,486174,487597,- I'm gonna need a longer bit.
8N5wssPlSdE,487597,488479,- [Linus] I don't understand it
8N5wssPlSdE,488480,490000,- Using something not meant to go on a drill
8N5wssPlSdE,490000,492040,but it's the only one that's gonna work.
8N5wssPlSdE,492040,493808,- Just go in your home.
8N5wssPlSdE,493808,495170,(drill whirring)
8N5wssPlSdE,495170,496003,- Nice.
8N5wssPlSdE,496003,497090,This is gonna work.
8N5wssPlSdE,497090,498560,- This is not going well.
8N5wssPlSdE,498560,501060,Now my Torx bit is stuck in the screw
8N5wssPlSdE,501060,502460,I'm trying to use to tap it.
8N5wssPlSdE,502460,504570,- Making progress.
8N5wssPlSdE,504571,506320,(drill whirring)
8N5wssPlSdE,506320,507153,- Oh God.
8N5wssPlSdE,507153,508266,"- [David] Oh, oh."
8N5wssPlSdE,508266,510900,(drill whirring)
8N5wssPlSdE,510900,511858,- It's all good.
8N5wssPlSdE,511858,512690,- Okay.
8N5wssPlSdE,513914,515099,"Hey, that's okay."
8N5wssPlSdE,515099,516259,Thanks Nick.
8N5wssPlSdE,516260,517200,You're my favorite.
8N5wssPlSdE,517200,519320,Nick Callanan at the office.
8N5wssPlSdE,519320,520153,- Nice
8N5wssPlSdE,520153,521340,"Four screws, that's all he's getting."
8N5wssPlSdE,521340,524099,- I got the autonomous MyoChair
8N5wssPlSdE,524099,525930,which is the cheapest ergo chair they make.
8N5wssPlSdE,525930,526763,This is really comfortable.
8N5wssPlSdE,526763,528040,I can feel the lumbar support.
8N5wssPlSdE,528040,529519,I'll be definitely a little bit more back.
8N5wssPlSdE,529520,532357,I'll feel like the world of Warcraft South park meme.
8N5wssPlSdE,532357,533860,- Whoever put this fitting in here
8N5wssPlSdE,533860,535430,was trying to be some kind of hero.
8N5wssPlSdE,535430,536980,"- In typical David fashion,"
8N5wssPlSdE,536980,540199,it seems that I have lost the screws
8N5wssPlSdE,540200,542141,that mount the monitor to this.
8N5wssPlSdE,542141,544380,So I'm gonna have to try a bunch of different screws.
8N5wssPlSdE,544380,545760,See if I have any that'll fit.
8N5wssPlSdE,545760,547620,"- God, that's why it's so tight."
8N5wssPlSdE,547620,551029,Whoever put this on used like pliers to tighten it on.
8N5wssPlSdE,551030,552480,You could see the teeth marks.
8N5wssPlSdE,552480,554490,"- I got so lucky,"
8N5wssPlSdE,554490,557430,the first screw that I grabbed from a random thing
8N5wssPlSdE,557430,558450,seems to work.
8N5wssPlSdE,558450,560320,"- [Linus] How nice for you, David."
8N5wssPlSdE,560320,561670,(laughing)
8N5wssPlSdE,561670,562503,"- Oh, I forgot."
8N5wssPlSdE,562503,564490,I have to build a shelf.
8N5wssPlSdE,564490,566240,"- [Linus] David, I hate your rig."
8N5wssPlSdE,566240,567370,It's killing me.
8N5wssPlSdE,567370,569440,- What do you think of my fancy shelf that I'm building?
8N5wssPlSdE,569440,570550,- It's wonderful.
8N5wssPlSdE,570550,573010,And I'm glad it's going much better than what I'm doing.
8N5wssPlSdE,573010,575190,- Everyone knows you shouldn't put your electronics
8N5wssPlSdE,575190,576290,"on carpet,"
8N5wssPlSdE,576290,577440,and I have two pets-
8N5wssPlSdE,577440,578273,"- [Linus] Wait a minute,"
8N5wssPlSdE,578273,579440,I didn't actually look closely at this.
8N5wssPlSdE,579440,580370,This is your shelf?
8N5wssPlSdE,580370,581977,- For underneath.
8N5wssPlSdE,581978,582811,It's gonna be on the ground
8N5wssPlSdE,582811,584310,so I can fit my feet underneath it.
8N5wssPlSdE,584310,585427,Wire manage underneath it.
8N5wssPlSdE,585427,587780,And then have all my computers and consoles on top.
8N5wssPlSdE,587780,588613,- You had said earlier
8N5wssPlSdE,588613,590740,that you don't consider yourself very handy.
8N5wssPlSdE,592120,593660,- This is why it's so simple.
8N5wssPlSdE,593660,594493,- You know what?
8N5wssPlSdE,594493,595326,"No, you know what?"
8N5wssPlSdE,595326,596159,I love it.
8N5wssPlSdE,596159,599540,"Your pumps in with the new card's not a mini card, David."
8N5wssPlSdE,599540,600540,- Is it not gonna fit?
8N5wssPlSdE,600540,601570,"It fits, look."
8N5wssPlSdE,601570,602583,Just shove it.
8N5wssPlSdE,603493,604326,Shove it harder.
8N5wssPlSdE,604326,605159,It's cool.
8N5wssPlSdE,605159,607730,I thought I chose a piece of lumber that was pretty straight
8N5wssPlSdE,607730,608760,but I had it flipped the other way
8N5wssPlSdE,608760,611130,and there was like an inch gap on this one.
8N5wssPlSdE,611130,612148,So-
8N5wssPlSdE,612148,613290,- This goes to show you can take David
8N5wssPlSdE,613290,614540,out of the junky setup
8N5wssPlSdE,614540,617350,but you can't take the junky setup out of David.
8N5wssPlSdE,617350,618290,You're having fun over there?
8N5wssPlSdE,618290,619920,- I'm having a great time.
8N5wssPlSdE,619920,621600,Am I doing a good job?
8N5wssPlSdE,621600,623889,- He starts with like the nicest looking pile
8N5wssPlSdE,623890,624820,of awesome stuff
8N5wssPlSdE,624820,626930,and then makes a shelf out of two by 10.
8N5wssPlSdE,626930,629740,- This is a camera that I had when I was a freelancer.
8N5wssPlSdE,629740,630580,And it's a great camera.
8N5wssPlSdE,630580,632800,It's the Black Magic Ursa 4.6K.
8N5wssPlSdE,632800,634450,"It's got a great sensor, great dynamic range,"
8N5wssPlSdE,634450,636943,but it's really not well suited to be a webcam.
8N5wssPlSdE,636943,638540,- $2000 webcam.
8N5wssPlSdE,638540,640269,My brain hurts all the way from the other room
8N5wssPlSdE,640270,641400,just listening to them.
8N5wssPlSdE,641400,643810,"- These are spherical, but they're seven years old."
8N5wssPlSdE,643810,646896,"They were built in East Berlin during the cold war,"
8N5wssPlSdE,646896,648750,like Zeiss Flektogons.
8N5wssPlSdE,648750,650650,"- Yeah, cinematic webcam then."
8N5wssPlSdE,650650,652640,- You wanna know why this isn't well-suited
8N5wssPlSdE,652640,653530,to be a webcam?
8N5wssPlSdE,653530,654363,Multiple reasons.
8N5wssPlSdE,654363,656430,"One, not a good low light sensor."
8N5wssPlSdE,656430,657920,"Two, no auto-focus."
8N5wssPlSdE,657920,658779,"Number three,"
8N5wssPlSdE,658780,661510,I have to open this and then reach in here and turn it on.
8N5wssPlSdE,661510,664270,"Reason four, this monitor doesn't flip around."
8N5wssPlSdE,664270,666500,So I have to have an external monitor on top.
8N5wssPlSdE,666500,669630,"Reason five, it's heavy as (beep) stupid"
8N5wssPlSdE,669630,671310,and so much work to use this
8N5wssPlSdE,671310,675060,but I'm probably the only person in the entire world
8N5wssPlSdE,675060,676529,using an Ursa to stream.
8N5wssPlSdE,676530,677980,So that's pretty cool.
8N5wssPlSdE,677980,679120,- I ran out of tubing.
8N5wssPlSdE,679120,684120,If David wants this to be the ghettoest sick rig ever
8N5wssPlSdE,684350,685410,then I'm gonna embrace it.
8N5wssPlSdE,685410,686579,"There you go, David."
8N5wssPlSdE,686580,687700,This is what you want?
8N5wssPlSdE,687700,688533,- [David] I love it.
8N5wssPlSdE,688533,689366,- There you go.
8N5wssPlSdE,689366,690500,I'm glad this is coming together
8N5wssPlSdE,690500,692410,but it makes me really unhappy.
8N5wssPlSdE,692410,694879,- I've installed the shelf underneath.
8N5wssPlSdE,694880,696700,"In order to get it over the radiator,"
8N5wssPlSdE,696700,699900,I flipped the support sideways and now it's really tall.
8N5wssPlSdE,699900,702720,And I'm worried that the computers won't fit
8N5wssPlSdE,702720,703879,underneath the table.
8N5wssPlSdE,703880,706550,Unless I raised the table up to an uncomfortable level.
8N5wssPlSdE,706550,707890,I feel like a little baby.
8N5wssPlSdE,707890,709087,Like.
8N5wssPlSdE,709087,709920,(camera crashes)
8N5wssPlSdE,709920,711639,"Oh, keep rolling."
8N5wssPlSdE,711640,712473,That's the danger.
8N5wssPlSdE,712473,713750,It's gotta be at balance.
8N5wssPlSdE,713750,714900,I don't have... It's pretty junk
8N5wssPlSdE,714900,716090,- For better or for worse it's done.
8N5wssPlSdE,716090,718080,But before we take the rig back into the computer room
8N5wssPlSdE,718080,719130,I want to at least...
8N5wssPlSdE,721600,722569,Hey David.
8N5wssPlSdE,722570,723403,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,723403,724390,- You got a vacuum?
8N5wssPlSdE,724390,725223,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,725223,726063,- I wouldn't know it.
8N5wssPlSdE,727790,730009,Before I use your vacuum to clean your computer.
8N5wssPlSdE,730010,731710,I might need to clean your vacuum.
8N5wssPlSdE,733807,734640,(vacuum cleaner whirring)
8N5wssPlSdE,734640,736230,"Ah, okay."
8N5wssPlSdE,736230,739120,It like does not come off.
8N5wssPlSdE,739120,741790,Maybe if I can grab some of the fibers
8N5wssPlSdE,741790,744880,I can actually pull a lot of the dust out.
8N5wssPlSdE,744880,746960,It's all about improvement at this point.
8N5wssPlSdE,746960,747793,Hey David.
8N5wssPlSdE,747793,748626,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,748626,750509,- I think I've got enough hair to make another dog.
8N5wssPlSdE,750510,752150,"So that's where you want it, in the corner there?"
8N5wssPlSdE,752150,753260,"- Yeah, that's the idea."
8N5wssPlSdE,753260,754530,"I think for today,"
8N5wssPlSdE,754530,756910,I might put another plank of wood on the ground
8N5wssPlSdE,756910,759060,and then just have both computers on the ground.
8N5wssPlSdE,759060,762410,Right now the table's really high to be able to fit it.
8N5wssPlSdE,762410,763980,And I don't really want the table that high.
8N5wssPlSdE,763980,764980,- I think this is the part
8N5wssPlSdE,764980,767370,where the video is supposed to include some justification
8N5wssPlSdE,767370,769400,for why you chose this particular TV.
8N5wssPlSdE,769400,771060,"- I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory."
8N5wssPlSdE,771060,773570,It's the best computer monitor slash gaming TV
8N5wssPlSdE,773570,775330,money can buy right now.
8N5wssPlSdE,775330,776163,- There you go.
8N5wssPlSdE,776163,776996,"- In 20 Hertz,"
8N5wssPlSdE,776996,778170,"HDMI 2.1,"
8N5wssPlSdE,778170,779160,it's OLED.
8N5wssPlSdE,779160,780569,"- Okay, let's make sure we get the peel"
8N5wssPlSdE,780570,782260,on the back of this one.
8N5wssPlSdE,782260,784180,I accidentally left Andy's on.
8N5wssPlSdE,784180,788170,And it turns out that it's actually needed for cooling.
8N5wssPlSdE,788170,790951,"David, you're an absolute mad lad, man."
8N5wssPlSdE,790952,791785,- [David] Why is that?
8N5wssPlSdE,791785,793750,- Why do you need water cooling in your NAS?
8N5wssPlSdE,793750,795780,- [David] I want top performance for those hard drives.
8N5wssPlSdE,795780,798000,"We're water-cooling the hard drives too, right?"
8N5wssPlSdE,798000,799759,- We're starting with six.
8N5wssPlSdE,799759,801980,You know that the radiators are gonna reduce
8N5wssPlSdE,801980,804376,"like your hard drive capacity though, right?"
8N5wssPlSdE,804377,805210,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,805210,806840,"- You know you don't need two triple radiators though,"
8N5wssPlSdE,806840,807673,right?
8N5wssPlSdE,807673,808839,- Oh man.
8N5wssPlSdE,808839,810620,I wanna push that 10100 so hard.
8N5wssPlSdE,810620,813000,I know it doesn't overclock but I'm gonna push it.
8N5wssPlSdE,813000,814050,"- [Linus] Okay, are you messing with me?"
8N5wssPlSdE,814050,815050,- Not even a little bit.
8N5wssPlSdE,815050,818761,"- Hey David, what are you using the one terabyte M.2 for?"
8N5wssPlSdE,818762,820060,"- [David] Oh, it's going in the other one."
8N5wssPlSdE,820060,820893,- Oh.
8N5wssPlSdE,820893,822820,The reason for that is while the 665P
8N5wssPlSdE,822820,824270,"is a really awesome drive,"
8N5wssPlSdE,824270,826620,it's kind of too awesome for the NAS.
8N5wssPlSdE,826620,830089,So what we want to do is just put a SATA drive in as a cache
8N5wssPlSdE,830090,830923,and then...
8N5wssPlSdE,830923,832029,"Ah, yes, this one."
8N5wssPlSdE,832030,834590,And then we'll throw this in the main gaming rig.
8N5wssPlSdE,834590,836500,"So, oops."
8N5wssPlSdE,836500,840440,"Anyway, we're running an Asrock B460,"
8N5wssPlSdE,840440,841520,steel legend motherboard.
8N5wssPlSdE,841520,844200,We didn't need anything super crazy
8N5wssPlSdE,844200,845690,because we're not gonna be overclocking
8N5wssPlSdE,845690,846690,or anything like that.
8N5wssPlSdE,846690,849770,"And this puppy has got a solid mix of decent VRM,"
8N5wssPlSdE,849770,850900,good expansion
8N5wssPlSdE,850900,853940,"and well, we don't actually need a ton of IO,"
8N5wssPlSdE,853940,854980,but-
8N5wssPlSdE,854980,855813,- [David] 2.5 gig though.
8N5wssPlSdE,855813,856720,- Does it have 2.5 gig
8N5wssPlSdE,856720,857553,"RAM on it? - [David] Yeah, it does."
8N5wssPlSdE,857553,859269,"- Oh, that's why we picked it."
8N5wssPlSdE,859270,862760,"As for our I3 10100, this is on the surface,"
8N5wssPlSdE,862760,864550,pretty overkill for a NAS.
8N5wssPlSdE,864550,868870,If all David wants is 2.5 gigabit transfers from his desktop
8N5wssPlSdE,868870,871130,over to his mass storage ray in here.
8N5wssPlSdE,871130,873740,"But if you wanted it to pull double duty,"
8N5wssPlSdE,873740,876330,as say for example a Plex media server
8N5wssPlSdE,876330,879800,"or in his case as a capture PC,"
8N5wssPlSdE,879800,882540,then it's looking like a pretty good choice.
8N5wssPlSdE,882540,883470,Question for you.
8N5wssPlSdE,883470,886170,Were you intending to throw that 1080 Ti in here
8N5wssPlSdE,886170,887003,to use NVENC?
8N5wssPlSdE,887003,888200,- Yes.
8N5wssPlSdE,888200,889033,- I see.
8N5wssPlSdE,889033,891260,That's why it needs to be water-cooled.
8N5wssPlSdE,891260,892910,You were just messing with me before.
8N5wssPlSdE,892910,894970,- We're gonna have a bit of challenge
8N5wssPlSdE,894970,897610,with the amount of PCIe lanes that we have
8N5wssPlSdE,897610,899519,and kind of the slots.
8N5wssPlSdE,899520,902040,"So we're gonna do capture card, graphics card,"
8N5wssPlSdE,902040,905170,and then for the HBA we're gonna have to do NVBMe
8N5wssPlSdE,905170,909497,to PCIe 4X to a riser card.
8N5wssPlSdE,909497,910330,"As you wait, no, I don't know."
8N5wssPlSdE,910330,911540,That's gonna go in there.
8N5wssPlSdE,911540,913560,"Linus is gonna figure out, it's gonna be great."
8N5wssPlSdE,913560,914800,- Here's a little trick.
8N5wssPlSdE,914800,915886,"- [David] I know it can do that,"
8N5wssPlSdE,915887,917775,but won't it lessen the performance?
8N5wssPlSdE,917775,919660,- You're plugging into hard drives.
8N5wssPlSdE,919660,920493,- It's fine? Okay.
8N5wssPlSdE,920493,921980,"- Now my CP water block,"
8N5wssPlSdE,921980,925459,I'm apparently salvaging that from your old system.
8N5wssPlSdE,925460,927140,- [David] Yeah 7700 K.
8N5wssPlSdE,927140,928090,"- I asked David, I'm like,"
8N5wssPlSdE,928090,929700,"hey, you were there for Andy's shoot."
8N5wssPlSdE,929700,931920,Is yours gonna be like relatively quick?
8N5wssPlSdE,931920,933565,"He's like, oh yeah."
8N5wssPlSdE,933565,934398,(laughter in the background)
8N5wssPlSdE,934398,935231,- I might need Linus' help
8N5wssPlSdE,935231,938362,because where we thought the stud was the drill is not...
8N5wssPlSdE,938362,939195,(drill whirring)
8N5wssPlSdE,939195,940028,Oh I'm going backwards.
8N5wssPlSdE,940028,941583,I'm a frigging moron.
8N5wssPlSdE,941583,942950,(drill whirring)
8N5wssPlSdE,942950,944167,- [Linus] It's extreme Tech upgrade.
8N5wssPlSdE,944167,946149,(beep)
8N5wssPlSdE,946150,949130,More like extreme tech overly ambitious employees.
8N5wssPlSdE,949130,950000,- This table's big.
8N5wssPlSdE,950000,950833,It's in my way.
8N5wssPlSdE,950833,953250,"Oh gee, Mikala, can I get a hand for a second?"
8N5wssPlSdE,953250,954083,"You can take your mask off,"
8N5wssPlSdE,954083,955040,'cause we live together.
8N5wssPlSdE,955040,955873,- We do?
8N5wssPlSdE,958144,959350,- Oh.
8N5wssPlSdE,959350,960490,- Holy (beep) we stripped it.
8N5wssPlSdE,960490,962080,- We're not even a tech show anymore.
8N5wssPlSdE,962080,965053,We're practically like a couple's home reno show now.
8N5wssPlSdE,966010,967410,"Oh no, we stripped it."
8N5wssPlSdE,967410,969040,You went single channel memory?
8N5wssPlSdE,969040,970870,- [David] It was the cheapest one in the world.
8N5wssPlSdE,970870,973270,"- It was the cheapest one and you had a budget, I guess."
8N5wssPlSdE,973270,976060,"Well, the good news is that you can always add another stick"
8N5wssPlSdE,976060,976893,of this
8N5wssPlSdE,976893,977726,- [David] Yeah that's the plan - and then you can up it
8N5wssPlSdE,977726,978830,to 32 gigs later.
8N5wssPlSdE,978830,980160,- I didn't even realize it was single channel
8N5wssPlSdE,980160,981240,but here we are.
8N5wssPlSdE,981240,982120,"- You know what, David,"
8N5wssPlSdE,982120,984420,it's the least junky thing about this setup.
8N5wssPlSdE,984420,986690,What is this optical drive for?
8N5wssPlSdE,986690,987670,- [David] You never know when you're gonna have
8N5wssPlSdE,987670,989029,to burn a PS3 game.
8N5wssPlSdE,989030,992190,"- You know that this case does not have a 5 1/4 inch bay,"
8N5wssPlSdE,992190,993023,right? - [David] It doesn't?
8N5wssPlSdE,993023,993856,"Yeah, then that's fine."
8N5wssPlSdE,993856,995113,I'll use it for a different build.
8N5wssPlSdE,995113,996880,- Oh my God.
8N5wssPlSdE,996880,1000807,It's so thought out and yet insane.
8N5wssPlSdE,1000807,1003853,It's carefully all kind of wrong.
8N5wssPlSdE,1004811,1007149,- [Mikala] Welcome to my life. (David laughing)
8N5wssPlSdE,1007150,1007983,"- Mikala, before I tighten it,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1007983,1009329,do you want to check the levelness?
8N5wssPlSdE,1010220,1012660,You don't think that a taco truck is open in front of-
8N5wssPlSdE,1012660,1014910,- The good news is that now that I have mounting hardware
8N5wssPlSdE,1014910,1016970,I'm making some serious progress over here.
8N5wssPlSdE,1016970,1018139,We've got the rear fan in.
8N5wssPlSdE,1018140,1019820,"We've got the motherboard mounted,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1019820,1020970,ready to put our GPU in.
8N5wssPlSdE,1020970,1022980,I had to actually put the GPU away.
8N5wssPlSdE,1022980,1024410,"I put it in the box for the new one,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1024410,1027199,"thinking, oh, well he's gonna sell this on eBay."
8N5wssPlSdE,1027199,1028899,"But no, that is in fact not the plan."
8N5wssPlSdE,1028900,1031380,It's gonna be handling NVENCing coding
8N5wssPlSdE,1031380,1033517,"for his capture VM, I guess."
8N5wssPlSdE,1033517,1034350,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,1034350,1036699,- I'm supposed to be out of here in like an hour and a half.
8N5wssPlSdE,1036699,1037699,"Tops. - Oh, (beep) I'm sorry."
8N5wssPlSdE,1037699,1039286,"- No worry, I got this."
8N5wssPlSdE,1039286,1040339,I got this.
8N5wssPlSdE,1040339,1041173,- [David] Is there no way
8N5wssPlSdE,1041173,1042250,we can have anyone else on windshield?
8N5wssPlSdE,1042250,1044670,- Where's my 120 millimeter fans.
8N5wssPlSdE,1044670,1045640,"- You don't need to plug in RGB,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1045640,1046860,I'm gonna turn it off anyway.
8N5wssPlSdE,1046860,1047693,- Neat.
8N5wssPlSdE,1047693,1049360,"You're getting one radiator, David."
8N5wssPlSdE,1049360,1050330,- The TV's on.
8N5wssPlSdE,1050330,1052200,I'm pretty excited about this mobility.
8N5wssPlSdE,1052200,1055620,"When I sit over there, I can tilt the monitor this way"
8N5wssPlSdE,1055620,1057550,"or at my desk, I can have it more this way."
8N5wssPlSdE,1057550,1060183,And there's actually enough thickness of the desk
8N5wssPlSdE,1060183,1062122,that I think I'll be able
8N5wssPlSdE,1062122,1063539,"to like play mouse and keyboard games at the desk,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1063540,1064770,which I wasn't expecting.
8N5wssPlSdE,1064770,1065680,"Yeah, it's..."
8N5wssPlSdE,1065680,1067760,"I'm so lucky, thank you Mikala,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1067760,1069230,"if you're watching this video, I love you."
8N5wssPlSdE,1069230,1070679,"- Meanwhile, in Linus land,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1070680,1073520,the nuts for the mounting brackets for the reservoir
8N5wssPlSdE,1073520,1074600,are missing.
8N5wssPlSdE,1074600,1077890,"Fortunately, there were a couple of random nuts"
8N5wssPlSdE,1077890,1080380,in the random baggy of hardware that David got.
8N5wssPlSdE,1080380,1082530,"So we've got that taken care of,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1082530,1085970,but in other bad news this mounting clip immediately broke.
8N5wssPlSdE,1085970,1087809,So we're down to one.
8N5wssPlSdE,1087810,1090890,I make no apologies for the junkyness of the solution.
8N5wssPlSdE,1090890,1091723,- [David] Give me junk.
8N5wssPlSdE,1091723,1093217,"- You're bearing witness to this, Andy."
8N5wssPlSdE,1093217,1094900,- [David] And it looks fine.
8N5wssPlSdE,1094900,1096720,"- Wait, do you not recognize the problem?"
8N5wssPlSdE,1096720,1097553,- [David] Nope.
8N5wssPlSdE,1097553,1098386,"- It's killing me too Andy,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1098386,1100470,but I'm in a hurry and clearly the client doesn't care.
8N5wssPlSdE,1100470,1102760,So we're adjusting our standards.
8N5wssPlSdE,1102760,1104150,"- Depending on the device,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1104150,1107642,"I have, yeah, it's my 2.1 to go to PS5 and to the PC."
8N5wssPlSdE,1107642,1110100,2.0 to go to my headphones
8N5wssPlSdE,1110100,1111140,which are gonna run off Arc.
8N5wssPlSdE,1111140,1112830,2.0 to go to the capture PC.
8N5wssPlSdE,1112830,1114110,So that's gonna be the pass through
8N5wssPlSdE,1114110,1116380,and I'm hoping that all my retro consoles
8N5wssPlSdE,1116380,1119280,can go through the capture station with zero input lag
8N5wssPlSdE,1119280,1121357,and all go through one input into the TV
8N5wssPlSdE,1121357,1122800,and it should be easy.
8N5wssPlSdE,1122800,1123881,"- Hey, David."
8N5wssPlSdE,1123881,1124714,- [David] Yes.
8N5wssPlSdE,1124714,1126440,"- This hard drive cage here,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1126440,1128149,is it even part of this case?
8N5wssPlSdE,1128150,1128983,- [David] Nope.
8N5wssPlSdE,1128983,1130260,- We've got another problem.
8N5wssPlSdE,1130260,1132420,The plastic sleds that are intended to go
8N5wssPlSdE,1132420,1136450,into these hard drive cages are apparently not here.
8N5wssPlSdE,1136450,1138740,We've got these ones that mount in the front
8N5wssPlSdE,1138740,1141360,so we can put two hard drives in today.
8N5wssPlSdE,1141360,1145130,"Oh, I need screws to just line up for me today."
8N5wssPlSdE,1145130,1146520,"- Linus, if I'm being honest,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1146520,1148260,the thing I'm most excited about today
8N5wssPlSdE,1148260,1150091,is this PlayStation three.
8N5wssPlSdE,1150091,1150924,- [Linus] What?
8N5wssPlSdE,1150924,1152630,- This is the PS3 I bought at launch.
8N5wssPlSdE,1152630,1154597,And it's the one that has the PS2 chip on it.
8N5wssPlSdE,1154597,1158070,"So it can actually play PS1, PS2 games without emulation"
8N5wssPlSdE,1158070,1159360,and output it for ADP.
8N5wssPlSdE,1159360,1162850,This was dead for 10 years and it seems to be revived
8N5wssPlSdE,1162850,1163809,but I haven't- - [Linus] What?
8N5wssPlSdE,1163810,1166840,- I haven't plugged it in and fully tested it.
8N5wssPlSdE,1166840,1168890,So there was a little bit up in the air
8N5wssPlSdE,1168890,1170520,but we're gonna find out today.
8N5wssPlSdE,1170520,1171460,- [Linus] Oh nice.
8N5wssPlSdE,1171460,1172649,- I'm so excited
8N5wssPlSdE,1172650,1174290,- Meanwhile I'm trying to figure out
8N5wssPlSdE,1174290,1177090,how the hell I'm gonna finish this water-cooled computer.
8N5wssPlSdE,1177090,1177923,Oh wow.
8N5wssPlSdE,1177923,1179960,You went all out on the capture card.
8N5wssPlSdE,1179960,1180793,- Oh yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,1180793,1182350,- Dang live gamer 4k.
8N5wssPlSdE,1182350,1183730,Get that HDR.
8N5wssPlSdE,1183730,1185960,- [David] Also record and stream at the same time
8N5wssPlSdE,1185960,1187970,like two separate applications.
8N5wssPlSdE,1187970,1189783,So that's a big reason why I want that one.
8N5wssPlSdE,1189784,1190770,- How do I want to tackle the one...
8N5wssPlSdE,1190770,1192570,"Oh my God, I haven't put the pump in yet."
8N5wssPlSdE,1192570,1197130,- I picked the Sony WH-L600s because they're wireless
8N5wssPlSdE,1197130,1197990,which is what I want.
8N5wssPlSdE,1197990,1199670,"I wanna be able to move around this room,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1199670,1201600,"but they connect through HDMI,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1201600,1203210,they've got zero latency.
8N5wssPlSdE,1203210,1204882,"It's not Bluetooth, it's radio."
8N5wssPlSdE,1205990,1207200,Mikala.
8N5wssPlSdE,1207200,1208990,"Oh, yeah, Daisy came over here"
8N5wssPlSdE,1208990,1211200,because she was excited to see you.
8N5wssPlSdE,1211200,1212330,One thing that was exciting to me
8N5wssPlSdE,1212330,1214039,is that it comes with this base station.
8N5wssPlSdE,1214040,1217260,"Like I said, it can do optical, but it also does arc"
8N5wssPlSdE,1217260,1219710,which is what I really want and aux
8N5wssPlSdE,1219710,1223529,so I can actually connected to a PC separately from the TV.
8N5wssPlSdE,1223530,1226640,Why I really want arc is that everything is going to the TV
8N5wssPlSdE,1226640,1228630,in HDMI and then one connection back to this
8N5wssPlSdE,1228630,1231700,means literally every device in this room
8N5wssPlSdE,1231700,1233279,can connect to these wireless headphones.
8N5wssPlSdE,1233280,1234120,No problem.
8N5wssPlSdE,1234120,1235610,"- Wow, this is sick."
8N5wssPlSdE,1235610,1238251,"- It's not super stable, so be careful."
8N5wssPlSdE,1238251,1239789,- Oh gosh.
8N5wssPlSdE,1239790,1241370,- This is a great moment in history
8N5wssPlSdE,1241370,1243373,or historical failure.
8N5wssPlSdE,1244520,1245660,Wait.
8N5wssPlSdE,1245660,1247170,"Oh, is this thing giving me trouble?"
8N5wssPlSdE,1247170,1248580,"Oh, I think something's wrong."
8N5wssPlSdE,1248580,1250049,It did better before.
8N5wssPlSdE,1250050,1251440,"Dang, it's not gonna work for this"
8N5wssPlSdE,1251440,1253429,but I'm gonna try again when you go.
8N5wssPlSdE,1253430,1256520,"- Hey, the good news is I think with your RTX 3080,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1256520,1258550,you can probably emulate PS1 games.
8N5wssPlSdE,1258550,1260460,I'm frustrated right now.
8N5wssPlSdE,1260460,1262140,This run is too tight here.
8N5wssPlSdE,1262140,1265370,"I mean, what I could do is I could just go full junk"
8N5wssPlSdE,1265370,1269330,and do a big loop over here and just bring it back around.
8N5wssPlSdE,1269330,1271640,You may recall that I claimed to be out of tubing before
8N5wssPlSdE,1271640,1274600,when I clearly have an entire additional spool.
8N5wssPlSdE,1274600,1276220,The reason for that was that I didn't want
8N5wssPlSdE,1276220,1278330,to dip into my tubing supply for this system.
8N5wssPlSdE,1278330,1281627,'cause I know the defined 7XL is an extremely large case
8N5wssPlSdE,1281627,1283740,and I thought I might actually need all of it.
8N5wssPlSdE,1283740,1286679,"As it turns out, we probably would have been fine,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1286680,1288300,but that's okay.
8N5wssPlSdE,1288300,1289180,We got there.
8N5wssPlSdE,1289180,1290510,"- With the room I had in my budget,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1290510,1292520,I figured this was one of the best mics I could get
8N5wssPlSdE,1292520,1293353,"for my use,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1293353,1294760,the rode pod mic.
8N5wssPlSdE,1294760,1295610,It's a dynamic mic.
8N5wssPlSdE,1295610,1296820,It's good at noise cancellation.
8N5wssPlSdE,1296820,1298440,"This can be a fairly noisy room,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1298440,1300269,especially now that there's all these consoles
8N5wssPlSdE,1300270,1301960,and PCs underneath.
8N5wssPlSdE,1301960,1303200,And it's a good starter microphone.
8N5wssPlSdE,1303200,1304580,We'll see if I like streaming.
8N5wssPlSdE,1304580,1307350,If you guys enjoy it and then maybe move up from there.
8N5wssPlSdE,1307350,1308429,- David.
8N5wssPlSdE,1308430,1309550,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,1309550,1313210,- Please tell me you have the extra modular cables
8N5wssPlSdE,1313210,1314450,for this power supply.
8N5wssPlSdE,1314450,1316260,I need a Molex connector.
8N5wssPlSdE,1316260,1317620,- [David] I'll bring over what I have.
8N5wssPlSdE,1317620,1319130,- They're not interchangeable.
8N5wssPlSdE,1319130,1320693,What power supply is this?
8N5wssPlSdE,1320693,1322510,- [David] That's for the N one.
8N5wssPlSdE,1322510,1323343,- Oh wait.
8N5wssPlSdE,1323343,1324533,"No, definitely not."
8N5wssPlSdE,1324533,1327055,"Yeah, these use a completely different connector."
8N5wssPlSdE,1327056,1327889,- [David] Shoot.
8N5wssPlSdE,1327889,1329900,"- Okay, we dip in this Molex connector"
8N5wssPlSdE,1329900,1333260,and we jam the pins in this PC express power connector.
8N5wssPlSdE,1333260,1334093,We don't need. - [David] Do it.
8N5wssPlSdE,1334093,1334933,"- Okay, so that's in there."
8N5wssPlSdE,1334933,1336533,- [David] Is this gonna work?
8N5wssPlSdE,1338091,1340070,"- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on."
8N5wssPlSdE,1340070,1341610,"Oh, I have them backwards."
8N5wssPlSdE,1341610,1342830,"So other than that, yes."
8N5wssPlSdE,1342830,1344659,"- [David] We have a smoke detector, it's cool."
8N5wssPlSdE,1344660,1346083,I bet we have insurance too.
8N5wssPlSdE,1347060,1348340,"That's how I'm gonna buy a house,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1348340,1350220,burn this place down.
8N5wssPlSdE,1350220,1351929,"Use the settlement money, heck yeah."
8N5wssPlSdE,1351930,1355460,- This conversation is making me extremely uncomfortable.
8N5wssPlSdE,1355460,1356700,Am I an accessory?
8N5wssPlSdE,1356700,1359330,You have to promise me you'll replace this after though.
8N5wssPlSdE,1359330,1360163,- [David] I promise.
8N5wssPlSdE,1360163,1361307,"Yeah, I'll get some electrical tape."
8N5wssPlSdE,1361307,1363340,"- No, no, that's not what I meant."
8N5wssPlSdE,1363340,1364820,"- [David] Oh, the cable?"
8N5wssPlSdE,1364820,1365653,- Yes.
8N5wssPlSdE,1365653,1366810,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,1366811,1368002,I'll do that too. - What do you think Andy?
8N5wssPlSdE,1368002,1368870,- [Andy] 99%.
8N5wssPlSdE,1368870,1370278,- 99%?
8N5wssPlSdE,1370278,1371111,- [Andy] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,1371111,1372293,"- Yeah, I don't think so."
8N5wssPlSdE,1379710,1380543,"Right,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1380543,1381760,"don't worry, I got this."
8N5wssPlSdE,1381760,1382593,"- [David] Yeah, you do."
8N5wssPlSdE,1382593,1384120,- I'm a hero.
8N5wssPlSdE,1384120,1386290,USB for Andrade goes here.
8N5wssPlSdE,1386290,1388380,- If you guys watch the ShortCircuits that I do
8N5wssPlSdE,1388380,1389500,which is generally nice.
8N5wssPlSdE,1389500,1392231,This is the best mouse money can buy right now for gaming.
8N5wssPlSdE,1392231,1395840,"I poo-pooed powerplay, but I'm willing to give it a shot."
8N5wssPlSdE,1395840,1397330,This is my opportunity.
8N5wssPlSdE,1397330,1399809,Its opportunity to make sure there's no vomit on it.
8N5wssPlSdE,1399810,1400643,Sweater.
8N5wssPlSdE,1400643,1401476,"Oh, I'm already sad,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1401476,1403549,you can't plug in the dongle to this.
8N5wssPlSdE,1403550,1404780,- It's really heavy.
8N5wssPlSdE,1404780,1406210,Where's this supposed to go?
8N5wssPlSdE,1406210,1407710,"- Somewhere under here,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1407710,1409149,I'm gonna have to figure out the details.
8N5wssPlSdE,1409150,1411050,I think I'm gonna have to put just a flat plank
8N5wssPlSdE,1411050,1411940,on the ground.
8N5wssPlSdE,1411940,1412773,- Okay.
8N5wssPlSdE,1412773,1415490,"It has a filtered underneath, so I don't have it down there."
8N5wssPlSdE,1415490,1416323,I gotta grab it.
8N5wssPlSdE,1416323,1417373,"- Okay, it'll be fine for today."
8N5wssPlSdE,1417373,1420180,With this computer it's this and the 403.
8N5wssPlSdE,1420180,1421320,- Let's give it a quick reboot
8N5wssPlSdE,1421320,1423190,and see if it just fires right up into Andrade.
8N5wssPlSdE,1423190,1424545,How cool would that be?
8N5wssPlSdE,1424546,1425379,- [David] That would be sick.
8N5wssPlSdE,1425379,1426350,We're doing it everybody.
8N5wssPlSdE,1426350,1427313,"- Okay, it doesn't."
8N5wssPlSdE,1428160,1429180,Yeah (beep) readability.
8N5wssPlSdE,1429180,1431230,You've got to have that camel back there.
8N5wssPlSdE,1432430,1433490,Andrade's booting.
8N5wssPlSdE,1433490,1434323,- [David] Amazing.
8N5wssPlSdE,1434323,1435260,"- Okay, so where does this go"
8N5wssPlSdE,1435260,1436093,and where does that go?
8N5wssPlSdE,1436093,1438030,"- [David] Oh, they're both gonna go in there."
8N5wssPlSdE,1438030,1438870,"- Okay, here we go."
8N5wssPlSdE,1438870,1439980,"Good luck, everybody."
8N5wssPlSdE,1439980,1441410,- [David] Tower login.
8N5wssPlSdE,1441410,1442243,What is that?
8N5wssPlSdE,1444080,1445740,- This doesn't have a network connection right now.
8N5wssPlSdE,1445740,1447440,"Oh, right."
8N5wssPlSdE,1447440,1448559,"Long story,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1448560,1451910,"Trendnet is sending over their 2 1/2 gigs switch,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1451910,1453150,but it's not here yet.
8N5wssPlSdE,1453150,1455140,2 1/2 gigabit is critical for David's setup.
8N5wssPlSdE,1455140,1457320,"Not because he has super fast internet,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1457320,1459580,"but because he needs a really, really fast link"
8N5wssPlSdE,1459580,1461549,between his NAS and his gaming machine
8N5wssPlSdE,1461550,1463370,so that he can edit video off of it.
8N5wssPlSdE,1463370,1465180,"Gigabit's okay,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1465180,1466956,"but 100 megabytes a second,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1466956,1470900,not that great these days for responsiveness.
8N5wssPlSdE,1470900,1472921,"250 megabytes a second,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1472921,1474676,now we're talking.
8N5wssPlSdE,1474676,1475620,- [David] Ethernet's plugged in now.
8N5wssPlSdE,1475620,1476670,- Ethernet is plugged in now? - [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,1476670,1479094,- People are gonna relate to this setup so much.
8N5wssPlSdE,1479094,1480960,Cause this is like true gamer.
8N5wssPlSdE,1480960,1481793,- [David] Yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,1481793,1482626,"- This isn't like poser,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1482626,1485039,or like RGB (beep) all over the place gamer.
8N5wssPlSdE,1485040,1486190,"- Actually while you're doing that,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1486190,1488740,I'll bring you the stuff that's quote unquote borrowed.
8N5wssPlSdE,1488740,1490330,"Yeah, so these are"
8N5wssPlSdE,1490330,1491460,from the donation pile. - Oh yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,1491460,1493100,I couldn't possibly care less about them.
8N5wssPlSdE,1493100,1495289,- And what about that R2D2?
8N5wssPlSdE,1495290,1497640,"- You know what, your gain is my loss."
8N5wssPlSdE,1497640,1499220,- That's my legal defense.
8N5wssPlSdE,1499220,1501110,- We were supposed to build a computer in it
8N5wssPlSdE,1501110,1502920,and we just like never got around to it.
8N5wssPlSdE,1502920,1504990,"That was like an impulse buy when I was at the mall,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1504990,1506410,"I was like, oh we should build a computer in that."
8N5wssPlSdE,1506410,1507320,Fair enough.
8N5wssPlSdE,1507320,1508509,- This room's going crazy.
8N5wssPlSdE,1508510,1509350,We're running out of room
8N5wssPlSdE,1509350,1511140,but I'm gonna pull out this bin.
8N5wssPlSdE,1511140,1514090,This is the bin that I unboxed on ShortCircuit.
8N5wssPlSdE,1514090,1516200,It's filled with retro games.
8N5wssPlSdE,1516200,1518350,I want to get my PS3 working again so I can play all those.
8N5wssPlSdE,1518350,1520307,But I have my analog super Nintendo so-
8N5wssPlSdE,1520307,1521910,- [Linus] Do you have Pilot Wings?
8N5wssPlSdE,1521910,1522743,- [David] I do not.
8N5wssPlSdE,1522743,1523576,"I used to have more,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1523576,1525980,friends steal a bunch and never return them.
8N5wssPlSdE,1525980,1526813,- [Linus] Dicks.
8N5wssPlSdE,1526813,1527646,- I know.
8N5wssPlSdE,1527646,1530410,"Kelly, you better fricking return my frigging super Metroid."
8N5wssPlSdE,1530410,1531438,Or I'll kill you.
8N5wssPlSdE,1531438,1533000,- Gotta give it a little Philly fill here.
8N5wssPlSdE,1533000,1534790,There's at least enough water in it this time
8N5wssPlSdE,1534790,1536300,that we should be able to leave it on long enough
8N5wssPlSdE,1536300,1537920,to see if we get a signal.
8N5wssPlSdE,1537920,1538753,"- [David] Ah, yeah."
8N5wssPlSdE,1538753,1539586,- Here we go.
8N5wssPlSdE,1539586,1540810,"All right, I'm closing the gaming rig,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1540810,1542934,"two water cooled systems, David."
8N5wssPlSdE,1542934,1545220,And does this rig just go right in next to this one?
8N5wssPlSdE,1545220,1546053,"- Yeah, sure."
8N5wssPlSdE,1546053,1548120,Today has been spoiled David day.
8N5wssPlSdE,1548120,1550900,I am so lucky to get all this stuff I've gotten.
8N5wssPlSdE,1550900,1552480,I know people all around the world
8N5wssPlSdE,1552480,1554299,"are trying to get 3080s, I got one,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1554300,1559300,but the one thing I cannot get is an LTT mouse pad.
8N5wssPlSdE,1559400,1560233,- [Linus] No stop it.
8N5wssPlSdE,1560233,1561066,- I can't.
8N5wssPlSdE,1561066,1562813,"- I know, there's more coming."
8N5wssPlSdE,1562813,1563646,There's more coming. - [David] Okay.
8N5wssPlSdE,1563646,1564630,I'll see if I can snag one.
8N5wssPlSdE,1564630,1566020,- We'll get you one when...
8N5wssPlSdE,1567030,1567863,Later.
8N5wssPlSdE,1567863,1570200,When all the paying customers are done.
8N5wssPlSdE,1570200,1572690,- So this is probably the least junk thing
8N5wssPlSdE,1572690,1573919,of my entire setup.
8N5wssPlSdE,1573920,1576270,I took old wood from my desk.
8N5wssPlSdE,1576270,1579060,"So I used to have not just two pieces of pied project,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1579060,1580210,I had four pieces.
8N5wssPlSdE,1580210,1581880,So I took one of those pieces.
8N5wssPlSdE,1581880,1584820,"I glued a desk pad to it,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1584820,1587980,put my keyboards wrist rest under there
8N5wssPlSdE,1587980,1590040,and it fits perfect on this armrest.
8N5wssPlSdE,1590040,1590873,It's a good enough thing.
8N5wssPlSdE,1590873,1593890,And I'll be able to play mouse and keyboard games on this TV
8N5wssPlSdE,1593890,1595560,with no issues at all.
8N5wssPlSdE,1595560,1597610,Oh my God.
8N5wssPlSdE,1597610,1599177,- That's the virtual machine.
8N5wssPlSdE,1599177,1600450,This is a good sign.
8N5wssPlSdE,1600450,1601283,- That's windows.
8N5wssPlSdE,1601283,1602899,- I'm gonna shut it down gracefully here.
8N5wssPlSdE,1602900,1606140,I'm going to add the USB receiver for this
8N5wssPlSdE,1606140,1608573,as well as the audio capture.
8N5wssPlSdE,1609470,1611440,And we're gonna try and pass those through as well.
8N5wssPlSdE,1611440,1612273,- Sir.
8N5wssPlSdE,1612273,1615820,"- Oh, you need your HDMI capture card passed through"
8N5wssPlSdE,1615820,1616993,as well.
8N5wssPlSdE,1616994,1617827,- Oh.
8N5wssPlSdE,1617827,1619430,"- Okay, theoretically, this is gonna work."
8N5wssPlSdE,1619430,1620263,Oh yeah.
8N5wssPlSdE,1622220,1623080,- [David] Is it working?
8N5wssPlSdE,1623080,1624740,- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
8N5wssPlSdE,1624740,1629740,The AVA media capture card is in the same ILM AMU group
8N5wssPlSdE,1629790,1631690,as your ethernet controller.
8N5wssPlSdE,1631690,1632523,- [David] What?
8N5wssPlSdE,1632523,1633356,- Really bad news.
8N5wssPlSdE,1633356,1636380,All the PCI express slots are bound to essential devices.
8N5wssPlSdE,1636380,1638864,So we can't pass through the AVA media part on its own.
8N5wssPlSdE,1638864,1642050,But remember that crazy stupid idea that you had
8N5wssPlSdE,1642050,1643140,to use one of these.
8N5wssPlSdE,1643140,1645970,What I'm hoping is that this top M.2 slot
8N5wssPlSdE,1645970,1647809,is connected directly to the CPU.
8N5wssPlSdE,1647810,1648880,I believe it is.
8N5wssPlSdE,1648880,1651400,"In which case, I think the likelihood is much higher"
8N5wssPlSdE,1651400,1652990,than it will be in its own ILM AMU group.
8N5wssPlSdE,1652990,1655559,So now we've got this riser cable.
8N5wssPlSdE,1655560,1657080,Oh my gosh.
8N5wssPlSdE,1657080,1659640,And now our capture card. (laughter in the background)
8N5wssPlSdE,1659640,1662640,- We found my limit and this is that.
8N5wssPlSdE,1662640,1664393,- The things we do for gaming.
8N5wssPlSdE,1665440,1667299,"Honestly, all things considered,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1667300,1668380,we're in pretty good shape.
8N5wssPlSdE,1668380,1669213,- [David] Yeah. - All you gotta do
8N5wssPlSdE,1669213,1671310,is swap out that capture card for a USB one.
8N5wssPlSdE,1671310,1672143,- Will do.
8N5wssPlSdE,1672143,1674320,- But this VM is working absolutely perfect-
8N5wssPlSdE,1674320,1675153,- [David] Amazing.
8N5wssPlSdE,1675153,1676490,- It's running at 240 Hertz right now.
8N5wssPlSdE,1676490,1677323,- [David] Yep.
8N5wssPlSdE,1677323,1678853,- You're ready for your first stream.
8N5wssPlSdE,1682100,1682933,- What's up hell cats.
8N5wssPlSdE,1682933,1683809,"How's it going, man?"
8N5wssPlSdE,1683810,1686070,Ready to watch me play some Parapa?
8N5wssPlSdE,1686070,1687440,Don't get people in the young 20s.
8N5wssPlSdE,1687440,1689678,"It's okay, they don't get you either."
8N5wssPlSdE,1689678,1690640,(gun firing)
8N5wssPlSdE,1690640,1691473,Sorry.
8N5wssPlSdE,1699540,1700470,This is so good.
8N5wssPlSdE,1700470,1703176,I'm gonna play this next time I'm having sex.
8N5wssPlSdE,1703176,1706003,"- [Gamer] Another squad, another squad."
8N5wssPlSdE,1707808,1710975,"- Yeah, I'm going for the finish here."
8N5wssPlSdE,1712150,1713380,"Okay, she's dead."
8N5wssPlSdE,1713380,1714360,- Well that wasn't easy
8N5wssPlSdE,1714360,1716410,and we're honestly not quite done yet.
8N5wssPlSdE,1716410,1718050,David's gonna swap out his capture card
8N5wssPlSdE,1718050,1719440,to get this going 100%
8N5wssPlSdE,1719440,1721259,"but all things considered,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1721260,1724610,we got a freaking ton done today.
8N5wssPlSdE,1724610,1728820,This looks absolutely freaking awesome.
8N5wssPlSdE,1728820,1729653,- [David] So much better.
8N5wssPlSdE,1729653,1730937,- Compared to the old setup
8N5wssPlSdE,1730937,1735230,"and knowing David, there's gonna be a lot of gaming hours"
8N5wssPlSdE,1735230,1736200,spent on this setup.
8N5wssPlSdE,1736200,1739289,"So again, you guys can find him @thechosendavid on Twitter"
8N5wssPlSdE,1739290,1740950,and he'll get all the information for you guys
8N5wssPlSdE,1740950,1743720,on where he's gonna be Twitch streaming all of a sudden.
8N5wssPlSdE,1743720,1745100,"Everyone's getting into Twitch streaming,"
8N5wssPlSdE,1745100,1746160,you know? - I know it's awesome.
8N5wssPlSdE,1746160,1747150,- It's crazy.
8N5wssPlSdE,1747150,1748220,It's crazy.
8N5wssPlSdE,1748220,1752000,But not everyone has a black magic Ursa 4.6 K
8N5wssPlSdE,1752000,1753300,"as their web cam, do they?"
8N5wssPlSdE,1753300,1754133,That's right.
