QZBUfZDe_0U,735120,739440,chunks of beef in these wide noodles
QZBUfZDe_0U,742800,744320,this is probably the mildest of the
QZBUfZDe_0U,744320,746399,pasta we tried today ragu is delicious
QZBUfZDe_0U,746399,749040,the beef is so tender and that beefy
QZBUfZDe_0U,749040,752000,flavor is just in every single bite of
QZBUfZDe_0U,752000,754480,this thing
QZBUfZDe_0U,757279,758880,with this one there's nothing too acidic
QZBUfZDe_0U,758880,761040,the flavors aren't crazy intense it's
QZBUfZDe_0U,761040,763760,just really meaty and good you can tell
QZBUfZDe_0U,763760,765279,right away the quality of the pasta is
QZBUfZDe_0U,765279,766800,superb i'm glad we got these three
QZBUfZDe_0U,766800,768160,because you got one that's rich and
QZBUfZDe_0U,768160,771040,creamy one that is lighter and spicy and
QZBUfZDe_0U,771040,772959,one that's extremely meaty i feel like
QZBUfZDe_0U,772959,774320,these three are really distinctively
QZBUfZDe_0U,774320,776000,different flavors and all delicious in
QZBUfZDe_0U,776000,777519,his own way plus like seriously you get

QZBUfZDe_0U,798480,801480,yes
QZBUfZDe_0U,804959,807600,back at the hotel dinner time this is a
QZBUfZDe_0U,807600,810560,really interesting dish this is a spicy
QZBUfZDe_0U,810560,813279,basil chicken there's tons of chilis in
QZBUfZDe_0U,813279,815519,here you can see the basil and this is
QZBUfZDe_0U,815519,819440,fried chicken over rice
QZBUfZDe_0U,819680,821360,this is absolutely
QZBUfZDe_0U,821360,823760,fantastic i feel this burning a hole in
QZBUfZDe_0U,823760,826000,my stomach as we speak this is so
QZBUfZDe_0U,826000,828320,incredibly spicy chicken is tender the
QZBUfZDe_0U,828320,831199,sauce is great very aggressively
QZBUfZDe_0U,831199,835279,seasoned wow and the chili
QZBUfZDe_0U,836800,838240,they are not
QZBUfZDe_0U,838240,840639,mushroom around with this dish i mean
QZBUfZDe_0U,840639,842880,spice is a solid nine out of ten and
QZBUfZDe_0U,842880,844800,it's done in such a good way because
QZBUfZDe_0U,844800,847440,it's really spicy but that's not all
QZBUfZDe_0U,847440,850000,there is to this dish it actually tastes
QZBUfZDe_0U,850000,852320,really really good and the sauciness of
QZBUfZDe_0U,852320,854639,the chicken goes great with the white
QZBUfZDe_0U,854639,857639,rice
QZBUfZDe_0U,859279,860800,hmm
QZBUfZDe_0U,860800,862079,for a dish i just hit it up in the
QZBUfZDe_0U,862079,864079,microwave absolutely superb all right
QZBUfZDe_0U,864079,865920,this is really interesting this is a
QZBUfZDe_0U,865920,867839,sausage roll i've been hearing a lot of
QZBUfZDe_0U,867839,869680,good things about it it's not really
QZBUfZDe_0U,869680,871519,sure what it is from the outside looking
QZBUfZDe_0U,871519,873120,in it kind of looks like a hot pocket
QZBUfZDe_0U,873120,875199,but oh look at this this thing is like a
QZBUfZDe_0U,875199,877680,giant something look at this massive
QZBUfZDe_0U,877680,879440,meatball on the inside and the outside
QZBUfZDe_0U,879440,881279,is flaky obviously this is microwave so
QZBUfZDe_0U,881279,882720,it's not going to be all that flaky and
QZBUfZDe_0U,882720,884720,this pulled pork and little bits of
QZBUfZDe_0U,884720,886560,apple i think on the inside as well so
QZBUfZDe_0U,886560,888720,it's called the sausage roll and so yeah
QZBUfZDe_0U,888720,890720,it's a giant sausage
QZBUfZDe_0U,890720,893839,rolled into a pastry
QZBUfZDe_0U,895839,897199,i really like this my dog's can be
QZBUfZDe_0U,897199,898800,really dry i mean the sausage is not the
QZBUfZDe_0U,898800,900639,juiciest thing but it's tender and it's
QZBUfZDe_0U,900639,904199,spiced phenomenally
QZBUfZDe_0U,904800,906880,you can see the little bits of pulled
QZBUfZDe_0U,906880,909199,pork so this is sausage with pulled pork
QZBUfZDe_0U,909199,910880,inside and also you can taste the
QZBUfZDe_0U,910880,912959,sweetness of the apples as well i can
QZBUfZDe_0U,912959,914480,just imagine this thing actually having
QZBUfZDe_0U,914480,917120,a really crusty flaky outer shell being
QZBUfZDe_0U,917120,919600,just so freaking scrumptious even right
QZBUfZDe_0U,919600,921920,now the sausage flavor is so good really
QZBUfZDe_0U,921920,923519,can taste the potential of this dish
QZBUfZDe_0U,923519,924639,also i kind of wish i had some kind of
QZBUfZDe_0U,924639,926000,dipping sauce that would have made this
QZBUfZDe_0U,926000,927839,even better this last dish is really
QZBUfZDe_0U,927839,931279,cool this is a peking duck in a box
QZBUfZDe_0U,931279,935040,hoisin sauce scallions cucumbers oh this
QZBUfZDe_0U,935040,936800,is pretty authentic because it's
QZBUfZDe_0U,936800,939040,actually got the thin crepes inside this
QZBUfZDe_0U,939040,941839,packaging
QZBUfZDe_0U,942480,945120,scallions and cucumbers a little hoisin
QZBUfZDe_0U,945120,946720,sauce
QZBUfZDe_0U,946720,949120,the skin is obviously not that crispy i
QZBUfZDe_0U,949120,950959,think this thing the skin will somehow
QZBUfZDe_0U,950959,953360,put through an air fryer and bring back
QZBUfZDe_0U,953360,956880,the crispiness somehow
QZBUfZDe_0U,958290,961419,[Music]
QZBUfZDe_0U,963920,965279,obviously the skin is really soft and
QZBUfZDe_0U,965279,966800,that's like and that's of course one of
QZBUfZDe_0U,966800,968480,the most distinct characteristics of a
QZBUfZDe_0U,968480,970399,peeking duck the super crispy mellow
QZBUfZDe_0U,970399,972320,your mouth skim that aside the flavor
QZBUfZDe_0U,972320,974240,from the crepe to the tender duck meat
QZBUfZDe_0U,974240,975839,that's just delicious i mean there's
QZBUfZDe_0U,975839,977920,really no way to do like a like a good
QZBUfZDe_0U,977920,979600,peeking duck to go and i totally knew
QZBUfZDe_0U,979600,980800,that when i was getting this i wasn't
QZBUfZDe_0U,980800,982639,asking for perfection i was just asking
QZBUfZDe_0U,982639,985279,for not bad and this is definitely
QZBUfZDe_0U,985279,988079,not bad my favorite thing that i got 100
QZBUfZDe_0U,988079,990000,that basil rice that i think is right on
QZBUfZDe_0U,990000,992560,my alley
QZBUfZDe_0U,994880,998399,and i'm pretty happy about this as well
QZBUfZDe_0U,1001519,1002959,good morning breakfast is gonna be the
QZBUfZDe_0U,1002959,1005120,iberico ham sandwich i've been waiting
QZBUfZDe_0U,1005120,1008399,for breakfast so i can eat this
QZBUfZDe_0U,1009440,1010399,wow
QZBUfZDe_0U,1010399,1012720,look at this thing of beauty stuffed
QZBUfZDe_0U,1012720,1015680,full of iberico ham on a crispy baguette
QZBUfZDe_0U,1015680,1016720,well it's not gonna be that crispy
QZBUfZDe_0U,1016720,1017839,anymore because it's been sitting in my
QZBUfZDe_0U,1017839,1020720,fridge all night but that is a ton of
QZBUfZDe_0U,1020720,1022399,ham in this baguette also i think this
QZBUfZDe_0U,1022399,1025038,baguette probably turned a little stale
QZBUfZDe_0U,1025038,1028240,but oh man
QZBUfZDe_0U,1028240,1031199,that's a lot of ham
QZBUfZDe_0U,1035520,1037600,tons of ham olive oil it's probably not
QZBUfZDe_0U,1037600,1039038,the best sandwich to have left sitting
QZBUfZDe_0U,1039038,1040319,in the fridge all night because the
QZBUfZDe_0U,1040319,1041678,bread is a little stale now but there's
QZBUfZDe_0U,1041678,1044000,just no denying how delicious this ham
QZBUfZDe_0U,1044000,1045760,is

QZBUfZDe_0U,1050480,1054000,it's earthy it's so amazingly satisfying
QZBUfZDe_0U,1054000,1056000,and savory and it's just perfect in a
QZBUfZDe_0U,1056000,1057760,sandwich with just a little bit of olive
QZBUfZDe_0U,1057760,1060559,oil that's all you need
QZBUfZDe_0U,1062720,1064799,and the olive oil usually is so
QZBUfZDe_0U,1064799,1067520,delicious as well everywhere i go i love
QZBUfZDe_0U,1067520,1069360,going to the local grocery stores or
