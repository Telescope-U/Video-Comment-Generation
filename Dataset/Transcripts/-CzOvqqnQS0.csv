-CzOvqqnQS0,254400,261440,like a minced meat  blend of spices and  oily juices and meat juice that's one of
-CzOvqqnQS0,261440,268400,their signature dishes i think that  combination but then they have such a  variety of dishes actually a bunch of  vegetable dishes chicken curries they
-CzOvqqnQS0,268400,273840,have the chickpeas and their chicken  fry looked absolutely irresistible so i
-CzOvqqnQS0,273840,279199,had to get it too normally i've seen  keema that's just pure meat this one  looks like it has chunks of potatoes
-CzOvqqnQS0,279199,286080,chickpeas and peas inside so it's not  only  meat oh nice okay so here we go the hot
-CzOvqqnQS0,286080,292080,fresh chapatis just cooked to perfection  and i'm gonna scoop in first for that

-CzOvqqnQS0,314320,319919,oh wow  oh that is  amazing
-CzOvqqnQS0,319919,327039,oh  again what i love about chapatis is that  they're  they're dry fried so they're not greasy
-CzOvqqnQS0,327039,334000,not oily  but just that smokiness from the griddle  and then that keema oh man
-CzOvqqnQS0,334000,339360,it has an incredible meatiness to it it  tastes like mutton i'm not totally sure  but you can definitely taste that
-CzOvqqnQS0,339360,346240,meatiness it's not too oily  it's flavorful the potato melts in your  mouth the peas have a little starchiness
-CzOvqqnQS0,346240,351440,to them that is what you want to be  starting your day off with okay i'm  going to go in for the
-CzOvqqnQS0,351440,357000,chickpeas next  these are huge and saucy
-CzOvqqnQS0,366560,372080,oh wow  that is rich  oh man
-CzOvqqnQS0,372080,378639,those chickpeas are so soft they melt in  your mouth i'll go for that chicken fry  next so i think it is
-CzOvqqnQS0,378639,386680,yeah it does look crispy it looks like  it's been fried rather than grilled  i just couldn't resist it
-CzOvqqnQS0,394240,401199,like just a light spice blend  which has just been crusted onto the  chicken  and
-CzOvqqnQS0,401199,409080,yeah not too strong of a flavor not too  many spices but just good okay next up  for the  okra
-CzOvqqnQS0,416800,422800,i love okra  i love that kind of slimy texture  and then the last dish that i got is the
-CzOvqqnQS0,422800,428080,chicken curry  um that sauce looks absolutely fantastic
-CzOvqqnQS0,428080,433918,and again  again going for  chapati
-CzOvqqnQS0,434080,439520,any kind of like kind of pinch off some  of that chicken
-CzOvqqnQS0,440639,446120,and i'll load it up with some more of  that  curry sauce
-CzOvqqnQS0,454560,459759,kind of a mellow blend of spices but  just  like a harmony
-CzOvqqnQS0,459759,465120,and it is all good  but definitely i think their signature  keema
-CzOvqqnQS0,465120,471360,and also the the chickpeas  those are probably the two standout  dishes dishes that i would not miss
-CzOvqqnQS0,471360,476479,coming here to eat along with that  chapati but really  you cannot make a bad decision here
-CzOvqqnQS0,476479,484639,everything you see is gonna be top of  the notch delicious  outstanding an amazing place

-CzOvqqnQS0,681279,687760,packed i have been here the last time i  was in  singapore an amazing hawker center today

-CzOvqqnQS0,694800,699399,there's so much delicious food the  aromas
-CzOvqqnQS0,702800,708160,no i'm still walking walking around  wandering around this place i mean i
-CzOvqqnQS0,708160,715120,remember it was incredible but this  place is absolutely insane there's so  much good food there's such a diversity
-CzOvqqnQS0,715120,721760,i mean that represents singapore and the  diversity of food available  so much of a variety of indian food and
-CzOvqqnQS0,721760,727200,then a whole chinese section of the  market as well  truly
-CzOvqqnQS0,727200,732639,an amazing representation of the  delicious food available in singapore
-CzOvqqnQS0,732639,737920,and the love for eating and i'm still  walking around  looking for the place we're trying to
-CzOvqqnQS0,737920,745040,find man okay some bad some sad news i  had wanted to try out this place called
-CzOvqqnQS0,745040,751920,ajmer sharif for their migoreng mamak  style  but unfortunately they're closed no open
-CzOvqqnQS0,751920,757120,hours so we'll have to find something  else and believe me there are a lot of
-CzOvqqnQS0,757120,763360,other choices and just walking around  this food center just everything just  makes your mouth water
-CzOvqqnQS0,763360,771720,just arouses your senses and your taste  buds so we're just gonna find something  else to eat while we're here
-CzOvqqnQS0,784900,788179,[Music]
-CzOvqqnQS0,790570,796720,[Music]  got my tray of masala dosa but man it's  it's pretty hectic you got to be
-CzOvqqnQS0,796720,802079,aggressive you got to get in line you  got to make your way to the front you  gotta tell them your order uh and then
-CzOvqqnQS0,802079,808000,on top of that you have to find a seat  but definitely today is the weekend so  it is probably busier
-CzOvqqnQS0,808000,813760,than on a weekday but man i love the  atmosphere love the  just
-CzOvqqnQS0,813760,820800,busyness  and just the variety available here  such a cool place really the center of
-CzOvqqnQS0,820800,826720,indian culture for food  in singapore so i got a masala dosa  there should be some potatoes in the
-CzOvqqnQS0,826720,833040,center and with a sambar on the side and  with like a coconut chutney  all right let's start with that sambar
-CzOvqqnQS0,833040,838800,oh  fresh off the grill oh that's hot wow i  love how it's served to you on a tray
-CzOvqqnQS0,838800,844639,again this is food court hawker center  classic singapore style
-CzOvqqnQS0,847760,854480,oh fantastic crispy and gooey  and bubbly  but dense at the same time you taste the
-CzOvqqnQS0,854480,860160,mustard seed the tartness of the tomato  and i love how they just pile that
-CzOvqqnQS0,860160,869160,sambar directly under your dosa so it  just kind of absorbs soaks everything up  and you can kind of mix and match
-CzOvqqnQS0,872720,879680,very good simple  and i don't think there's any better  representation  of tamil nadu
-CzOvqqnQS0,879680,885839,and especially the tamil culture  that's  very strong that has a long history
-CzOvqqnQS0,885839,892480,in singapore i mean for me there's no  greater way to experience the tamil nadu  culture than through food and a dosa
-CzOvqqnQS0,892480,900800,like this  is just one of the pure representations  of tamil nadu okay let's go in for that  uh that coconut
-CzOvqqnQS0,909450,914560,[Music]  it's a little bit different from what  i've had it has almost more of a
-CzOvqqnQS0,914560,932339,like a smoky flavor to it  [Music]
-CzOvqqnQS0,932639,938570,i love the mustard seed  the fenugreek and the the fennel in  there

-CzOvqqnQS0,1011759,1018399,oh wow yeah  oh that hits the spot  sweet but not overly sweet so pure
-CzOvqqnQS0,1018399,1025438,has uh i love that i mean i love it with  that contrast of that squeeze of  calamansi to  to bring out the flavor
-CzOvqqnQS0,1025438,1032319,that acidity to break the sugar  great refreshing this is necessary when

-CzOvqqnQS0,1200240,1205679,yellow rice so i chose the yellow rice  which is like a biryani but vegetarian  biryani oh it's so aromatic you could
-CzOvqqnQS0,1205679,1211039,smell the cardamom pods in there i think  there's some fennel there's some cashews  in there i got yellow rice all the
-CzOvqqnQS0,1211039,1218799,different vegetarian dishes and then  they come around with a tray of all the  meat dishes that are on display at the  front just piles of meat dishes
-CzOvqqnQS0,1218799,1226320,chicken fry with onions fish mutton it's  all there it's all available this place  is popular and man does it look
-CzOvqqnQS0,1226320,1229320,outstanding
-CzOvqqnQS0,1238080,1244400,thank you  bitter gourd maybe bitter gourd some  cabbage an achar like a pickle i
-CzOvqqnQS0,1244400,1251200,the thing that looks really good that  caught my attention was the chicken fry  with onions we got mutton curry we got  fried fish all together
-CzOvqqnQS0,1251200,1257840,oh man this is the type of meal one of  my favorite meals on earth so the yellow  rice i'm not totally sure why it's
-CzOvqqnQS0,1257840,1264159,yellow maybe the turmeric  oh that's hot yeah you can see cashews  in the yellow rice you can see all the
-CzOvqqnQS0,1264159,1266880,spices in there
-CzOvqqnQS0,1273840,1279840,it's so fluffy  and then just  covered with that doll to make it  starchy
-CzOvqqnQS0,1279840,1285760,the the yellow rice is not too  not really strong in flavor but maybe
-CzOvqqnQS0,1285760,1290799,just a light it's more of the aromatic  spices almost more like a pulao
-CzOvqqnQS0,1290799,1297360,where it has the flavor of cardamom and  fennel but not really overpowering i'll  move into some of this
-CzOvqqnQS0,1297360,1301569,cabbage  [Music]
-CzOvqqnQS0,1304799,1310799,you can taste the mustard seed and the  curry leaves in there other than that  it's quite mellow it's
-CzOvqqnQS0,1310799,1316840,there's something a little bit starchy  within the cabbage though too almost  tastes like dal  to make it starchy within the
-CzOvqqnQS0,1316840,1322000,cabbage i'm ready to move into that  chicken and to be honest with you this  looks like the type of chicken where the
-CzOvqqnQS0,1322000,1327520,chicken will be good  but i think i'm  more excited much more excited about all
-CzOvqqnQS0,1327520,1332799,those caramelized onions and  curry leaves  and the actual chicken itself look at
-CzOvqqnQS0,1332799,1338559,that that's just a  an entire handful of caramelized onions
-CzOvqqnQS0,1342720,1348480,so sweet  oh man  yeah it's not even salty that's just  like pure
-CzOvqqnQS0,1348480,1354000,caramel onions  the sweetness has just submerged
-CzOvqqnQS0,1354000,1361840,they're kind of gooey  so much flavor and i'll try some of the  fried fish the fish fry
-CzOvqqnQS0,1363050,1368679,[Music]  it looks like it's king mackerel
-CzOvqqnQS0,1376640,1382320,yeah  it's  not i think not a lot of spice in there  but just maybe a masala paste before
-CzOvqqnQS0,1382320,1387360,it's fried and then just the  actual meatiness and the leanness
-CzOvqqnQS0,1387360,1391760,of that king mackerel it looks like it's  bitter gourd
-CzOvqqnQS0,1398880,1404400,oh yeah the bitterness comes through but  it's not overpowering  that's just a pleasant bitterness that
-CzOvqqnQS0,1404400,1409440,kind of mellows out in that sauce with  the mustard seeds  [Music]
-CzOvqqnQS0,1409440,1416240,and to be honest i think i would have  preferred this meal  with rice white rice and i think that's  what would be more common
-CzOvqqnQS0,1416240,1422880,because then you can  really taste the flavors of the dishes  more because the rice  i mean kind of gets
-CzOvqqnQS0,1422880,1428720,mumbled between all the different  flavors but i was just curious when they  said yellow rice so i had to try it okay
-CzOvqqnQS0,1428720,1431840,next up for the mutton curry
