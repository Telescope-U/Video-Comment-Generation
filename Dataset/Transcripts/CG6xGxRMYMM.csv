CG6xGxRMYMM,399,2320,about seven years ago honda expanded
CG6xGxRMYMM,2320,4240,their suv family in america with the
CG6xGxRMYMM,4240,7040,subcompact hrv now at the time the
CG6xGxRMYMM,7040,8639,subcompact segment was still in its
CG6xGxRMYMM,8639,10480,infancy and since then a ton of new
CG6xGxRMYMM,10480,12240,competitors have shown up which is why
CG6xGxRMYMM,12240,13759,i'm at the jam handy studio here in
CG6xGxRMYMM,13759,15360,detroit michigan show you guys the
CG6xGxRMYMM,15360,17600,completely redesigned second generation
CG6xGxRMYMM,17600,19840,hrv it's now built off of the new civics
CG6xGxRMYMM,19840,21840,platform which means it's larger more
CG6xGxRMYMM,21840,24000,powerful more stylish and at a starting
CG6xGxRMYMM,24000,26480,price of well under 25 000 it's still
CG6xGxRMYMM,26480,28640,really affordable so let's take a first
CG6xGxRMYMM,28640,31640,look
CG6xGxRMYMM,36680,38160,[Music]
CG6xGxRMYMM,38160,39920,so with the honda fit no longer in
CG6xGxRMYMM,39920,42079,honda's north american lineup the hrv is
CG6xGxRMYMM,42079,44800,now the entry level point into the honda
CG6xGxRMYMM,44800,46640,brand and i have to say this all new
CG6xGxRMYMM,46640,48239,version being built off of the civic
CG6xGxRMYMM,48239,49760,platform means it's a much larger
CG6xGxRMYMM,49760,51520,vehicle it's a much more premium vehicle
CG6xGxRMYMM,51520,53360,and as you can see the styling direction
CG6xGxRMYMM,53360,55440,of this suv has i haven't really seen on
CG6xGxRMYMM,55440,57120,any other honda suv before honda is
CG6xGxRMYMM,57120,58800,going to be working on a bunch of new
CG6xGxRMYMM,58800,60719,suvs in the coming years you should be
CG6xGxRMYMM,60719,62719,seeing a new version the crv the pilot
CG6xGxRMYMM,62719,64158,the passport at some point but since
CG6xGxRMYMM,64158,65439,we're talking about the hrv let's go
CG6xGxRMYMM,65439,67119,ahead and focus on this all new
CG6xGxRMYMM,67119,68799,subcompact suv now first of all i've got
CG6xGxRMYMM,68799,70320,two trim levels here this is the sport
CG6xGxRMYMM,70320,72000,trim which is kind of the mid-grade and
CG6xGxRMYMM,72000,73920,there's also the top of the line ex-l
CG6xGxRMYMM,73920,75600,there's also a bass lx trim but i don't
CG6xGxRMYMM,75600,77280,have that here to show you guys today
CG6xGxRMYMM,77280,78400,but as you can see let's start with the
CG6xGxRMYMM,78400,79920,sport trim because the design language
CG6xGxRMYMM,79920,81840,here that i'm seeing is definitely very
CG6xGxRMYMM,81840,83200,interesting i mean the headlights have
CG6xGxRMYMM,83200,84960,that kind of skinny look that we've seen
CG6xGxRMYMM,84960,86240,on the new civic what i do like about
CG6xGxRMYMM,86240,88880,this new hrv is full led headlights come
CG6xGxRMYMM,88880,90320,standard you can see there's an led low
CG6xGxRMYMM,90320,91840,and high beam and led daytime running
CG6xGxRMYMM,91840,93759,light and even an led turn signal very
CG6xGxRMYMM,93759,95280,premium look if you guys remember the
CG6xGxRMYMM,95280,96880,previous generation hrv honda didn't
CG6xGxRMYMM,96880,99200,even offer led headlights except on the
CG6xGxRMYMM,99200,100320,touring trim which they actually
CG6xGxRMYMM,100320,102880,discontinued back in 2020. you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,102880,105119,this sport trim has kind of like a
CG6xGxRMYMM,105119,107200,matte finish black in the grill with
CG6xGxRMYMM,107200,108720,these more aggressive air intakes there
CG6xGxRMYMM,108720,110000,are no fog lights in the vehicle you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,110000,110960,see a lot of the vents that you're
CG6xGxRMYMM,110960,112159,seeing around the front fascia of the
CG6xGxRMYMM,112159,113680,vehicle are actually functional the
CG6xGxRMYMM,113680,115360,grille also looks interesting because
CG6xGxRMYMM,115360,117200,the honda emblem is actually above it
CG6xGxRMYMM,117200,118320,again it doesn't look like any other
CG6xGxRMYMM,118320,120000,honda suv that i've seen before so it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,120000,121759,got a completely new design language
CG6xGxRMYMM,121759,123280,this color on this sport trim is called
CG6xGxRMYMM,123280,124960,urban gray metallic it's a really nice
CG6xGxRMYMM,124960,127600,exterior color it goes again with the um
CG6xGxRMYMM,127600,129039,trends that people are seeing with a lot
CG6xGxRMYMM,129039,130319,of these colors now let's move over to
CG6xGxRMYMM,130319,132239,the exl trend because this is the higher
CG6xGxRMYMM,132239,133520,trim it's the top of the line for now
CG6xGxRMYMM,133520,135200,there is no touring trim you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,135200,136400,there's some slight differences in the
CG6xGxRMYMM,136400,138000,front fascia versus the sport you have a
CG6xGxRMYMM,138000,140080,gloss black grille and the lower front
CG6xGxRMYMM,140080,141840,skirt you have kind of similar air
CG6xGxRMYMM,141840,143760,intakes which are all functional even on
CG6xGxRMYMM,143760,145520,the exl no fog lights but you can see i
CG6xGxRMYMM,145520,146560,like how some of the vents here are
CG6xGxRMYMM,146560,147840,functional the headlights look
CG6xGxRMYMM,147840,149200,practically the same there's also
CG6xGxRMYMM,149200,151200,parking sensors on the exl so again a
CG6xGxRMYMM,151200,152800,lot of premium touches that you
CG6xGxRMYMM,152800,154879,typically don't find in this segment of
CG6xGxRMYMM,154879,156319,vehicle now moving over to the side of
CG6xGxRMYMM,156319,157920,the vehicle because it's now built off
CG6xGxRMYMM,157920,160080,of the civics platform the new hrv is
CG6xGxRMYMM,160080,161920,significantly larger i'm talking about
CG6xGxRMYMM,161920,164560,8.7 inches longer in overall length so
CG6xGxRMYMM,164560,166879,around 179 inches long this is almost
CG6xGxRMYMM,166879,168879,the same size as the current generation
CG6xGxRMYMM,168879,170800,honda crvs which is going to make the
CG6xGxRMYMM,170800,172879,hrv bigger than most of the competition
CG6xGxRMYMM,172879,173920,it's going to give us probably
CG6xGxRMYMM,173920,175840,best-in-class rear seat legroom and
CG6xGxRMYMM,175840,178000,cargo figures now looking at the wheels
CG6xGxRMYMM,178000,179840,you can see this exl version has a
CG6xGxRMYMM,179840,181840,17-inch wheel with kind of a two-tone
CG6xGxRMYMM,181840,183760,machine look to it with some all-season
CG6xGxRMYMM,183760,185680,tires i don't have the ground clearance
CG6xGxRMYMM,185680,187599,specifications yet but you can see this
CG6xGxRMYMM,187599,189280,one's all-wheel drive it should be right
CG6xGxRMYMM,189280,190640,around seven inches i believe that's
CG6xGxRMYMM,190640,191840,what the old one had you can see there's
CG6xGxRMYMM,191840,194959,some gloss black for the fenders
CG6xGxRMYMM,194959,196319,which kind of look well with the rest of
CG6xGxRMYMM,196319,197840,the body you can see the exl includes
CG6xGxRMYMM,197840,199920,body colored mirrors with side mirror
CG6xGxRMYMM,199920,201680,turn indicators and then you also get a
CG6xGxRMYMM,201680,203280,sunroof if you guys want a sunroof it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,203280,204799,just a standard sunroof and you have to
CG6xGxRMYMM,204799,207040,go for the exl trim to get it its
CG6xGxRMYMM,207040,209760,wheelbase is around 104.5 inches long so
CG6xGxRMYMM,209760,211200,it's about two inches longer and the
CG6xGxRMYMM,211200,212799,vehicle itself is about the same height
CG6xGxRMYMM,212799,214239,but it's also about two and a half
CG6xGxRMYMM,214239,216239,inches wider so this is going to give us
CG6xGxRMYMM,216239,218080,again way more interior space and that's
CG6xGxRMYMM,218080,219519,something that americans tend to really
CG6xGxRMYMM,219519,221360,want especially in this segment of
CG6xGxRMYMM,221360,222640,vehicle now looking at the rear let me
CG6xGxRMYMM,222640,223680,show you guys
CG6xGxRMYMM,223680,225440,the rear of this vehicle the lights you
CG6xGxRMYMM,225440,227440,can see kind of look like
CG6xGxRMYMM,227440,228640,the previous generation a little bit to
CG6xGxRMYMM,228640,230159,me but they've been updated
CG6xGxRMYMM,230159,232080,way more modern you have full led tail
CG6xGxRMYMM,232080,234000,lights with an led turn signal led
CG6xGxRMYMM,234000,235439,reverse light led brake light you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,235439,237680,see more gloss black on the rear with
CG6xGxRMYMM,237680,239439,the bumper with the rear bumper cover
CG6xGxRMYMM,239439,240400,and then you also have these well
CG6xGxRMYMM,240400,242080,integrated parking sensors as well and
CG6xGxRMYMM,242080,243680,then in terms of the cargo the one thing
CG6xGxRMYMM,243680,245280,i'm surprised to see is there's no power
CG6xGxRMYMM,245280,246959,liftgate although most vehicles in this
CG6xGxRMYMM,246959,248560,segment don't typically offer it i
CG6xGxRMYMM,248560,250400,believe only mazda is one that comes to
CG6xGxRMYMM,250400,251519,mind where they offer that but you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,251519,253519,see in terms of the cargo space you
CG6xGxRMYMM,253519,255439,still have best in class honda says
CG6xGxRMYMM,255439,257519,there's roughly just under 25 cubic feet
CG6xGxRMYMM,257519,259120,of space with the second row seats up
CG6xGxRMYMM,259120,261040,there's also some underfloor storage
CG6xGxRMYMM,261040,262160,over here if you want to hide some
CG6xGxRMYMM,262160,263440,things and then you can see here there's
CG6xGxRMYMM,263440,265040,also a temporary spare tire so you don't
CG6xGxRMYMM,265040,266960,have to deal with the fix flat kit and
CG6xGxRMYMM,266960,268720,then if you fold down these seats which
CG6xGxRMYMM,268720,270639,you can kind of do pretty easily from
CG6xGxRMYMM,270639,271680,back here
CG6xGxRMYMM,271680,272800,these seats actually fold down and
CG6xGxRMYMM,272800,274639,almost give you a completely flat load
CG6xGxRMYMM,274639,276000,floor and when you fold those down it
CG6xGxRMYMM,276000,278160,expands it out to around 55 cubic feet
CG6xGxRMYMM,278160,280080,which is actually about the same as the
CG6xGxRMYMM,280080,281360,previous generation because remember the
CG6xGxRMYMM,281360,283120,previous generation was based off of the
CG6xGxRMYMM,283120,284960,honda fit platform which offered that
CG6xGxRMYMM,284960,286160,magic seat now let me show you guys
CG6xGxRMYMM,286160,287600,really quick this sport trim over here
CG6xGxRMYMM,287600,289440,because the sport trim has a larger
CG6xGxRMYMM,289440,291680,wheel you can see the 18 inch wheel on
CG6xGxRMYMM,291680,293840,this trim has a gloss black finish to it
CG6xGxRMYMM,293840,295520,there's more like a burling berliner
CG6xGxRMYMM,295520,297199,black finish to it you can see it looks
CG6xGxRMYMM,297199,298560,really good especially with the body
CG6xGxRMYMM,298560,300240,lines of the sport model you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,300240,302479,unlike the aexl which had gloss black
CG6xGxRMYMM,302479,304400,this is kind of a flat black the side
CG6xGxRMYMM,304400,305840,mirrors are also black painted and then
CG6xGxRMYMM,305840,308160,you also get this black painted roof
CG6xGxRMYMM,308160,309840,spoiler at the back which definitely
CG6xGxRMYMM,309840,311600,makes it look a little bit more sporty
CG6xGxRMYMM,311600,313440,even though this is the lower end trim
CG6xGxRMYMM,313440,314960,you still get the premium touches like
CG6xGxRMYMM,314960,316320,the full led tail lights you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,316320,318240,it's got an led turn signal there's a
CG6xGxRMYMM,318240,320320,large black sport badge here which i
CG6xGxRMYMM,320320,321520,believe is going to be part of a dealer
CG6xGxRMYMM,321520,323280,accessory and then unlike the xl it also
CG6xGxRMYMM,323280,324960,gives you a nice chrome exhaust finisher
CG6xGxRMYMM,324960,326240,which looks really nice although it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,326240,328320,just on one side remember this engine or
CG6xGxRMYMM,328320,330080,this vehicle only comes with one engine
CG6xGxRMYMM,330080,331360,choice and then if you open up the cargo
CG6xGxRMYMM,331360,333039,area still no power liftgate but the
CG6xGxRMYMM,333039,334880,space is practically the same and the
CG6xGxRMYMM,334880,336960,interior of this vehicle also looks
CG6xGxRMYMM,336960,338400,really nice as well with the cloth and
CG6xGxRMYMM,338400,341199,the orange stitching
CG6xGxRMYMM,341199,342880,so now let's finally take a look at the
CG6xGxRMYMM,342880,345360,inside of the completely redesigned hrv
CG6xGxRMYMM,345360,346639,now i'm going to first start off in the
CG6xGxRMYMM,346639,348320,sport trim because this is the lower end
CG6xGxRMYMM,348320,349759,and we'll hop into the exl and show you
CG6xGxRMYMM,349759,351039,guys what the top trim looks like now
CG6xGxRMYMM,351039,352240,first of all getting inside and shutting
CG6xGxRMYMM,352240,353600,the door
CG6xGxRMYMM,353600,355280,the door has a nice solid sounding thunk
CG6xGxRMYMM,355280,356960,remember this is built off of the 11th
CG6xGxRMYMM,356960,358960,generation civic platform i have to say
CG6xGxRMYMM,358960,360560,first getting inside the interior this
CG6xGxRMYMM,360560,362240,is the sport model the lower end version
CG6xGxRMYMM,362240,364560,it still has a very premium feel the
CG6xGxRMYMM,364560,365919,seats you can see on the sport have this
CG6xGxRMYMM,365919,368000,kind of sport cloth texture with the
CG6xGxRMYMM,368000,369600,orange accent stitching the driver's
CG6xGxRMYMM,369600,371199,seat has a six-way manual adjustment
CG6xGxRMYMM,371199,372800,just a four-way manual on this side for
CG6xGxRMYMM,372800,374560,the passenger no heated or actually i'm
CG6xGxRMYMM,374560,376160,sorry it does have heated seats even for
CG6xGxRMYMM,376160,377759,the sport so i'm assuming the lx is the
CG6xGxRMYMM,377759,379199,one that doesn't give you that feature
CG6xGxRMYMM,379199,380479,but you can see here also the steering
CG6xGxRMYMM,380479,381919,wheel comes directly off of the new
CG6xGxRMYMM,381919,383600,civic with the gloss black accents the
CG6xGxRMYMM,383600,386160,orange stitching it does offer a tilt
CG6xGxRMYMM,386160,387840,and telescoping ability with a pretty
CG6xGxRMYMM,387840,389759,good amount of adjustability and for an
CG6xGxRMYMM,389759,391360,entry-level model or basically an
CG6xGxRMYMM,391360,393120,entry-level model the materials in here
CG6xGxRMYMM,393120,394880,are really fantastic i mean the design
CG6xGxRMYMM,394880,396800,of the interior looks a lot like the
CG6xGxRMYMM,396800,398560,current generation civic the door panel
CG6xGxRMYMM,398560,400000,you can see has a soft touch injection
CG6xGxRMYMM,400000,401360,molded plastic
CG6xGxRMYMM,401360,402880,over here on this panel here it is
CG6xGxRMYMM,402880,404240,slightly hard touch but at least it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,404240,405600,padded down here where my elbows would
CG6xGxRMYMM,405600,407520,rest the windows are one touch up and
CG6xGxRMYMM,407520,409440,down for both front windows however not
CG6xGxRMYMM,409440,411280,for the rear they have that high quality
CG6xGxRMYMM,411280,413120,tactile feel that we've experienced in
CG6xGxRMYMM,413120,414639,some of the newer honda products and
CG6xGxRMYMM,414639,416240,then over here on the dash you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,416240,417680,this is a soft touch injection molded
CG6xGxRMYMM,417680,419360,plastic this is even a padded area here
CG6xGxRMYMM,419360,420720,where this is kind of like a leatherette
CG6xGxRMYMM,420720,422479,material with some genuine stitching and
CG6xGxRMYMM,422479,424080,it actually is accentuated over here on
CG6xGxRMYMM,424080,425680,the center console which by the way the
CG6xGxRMYMM,425680,426720,center console has been completely
CG6xGxRMYMM,426720,427919,redesigned i'll get to that in just a
CG6xGxRMYMM,427919,429520,moment now this is the base screen that
CG6xGxRMYMM,429520,431520,you get on the lx and the sport it's a
CG6xGxRMYMM,431520,433919,7-inch touchscreen display it does have
CG6xGxRMYMM,433919,435759,android auto and apple carplay and it
CG6xGxRMYMM,435759,437280,also has a backup camera of course if
CG6xGxRMYMM,437280,438479,you put into
CG6xGxRMYMM,438479,439759,reverse it gives you three different
CG6xGxRMYMM,439759,441199,angles and views it has rear cross
CG6xGxRMYMM,441199,442960,traffic alert the backup camera itself
CG6xGxRMYMM,442960,445520,looks pretty fine no 360 camera but this
CG6xGxRMYMM,445520,447120,is the smaller display it is lacking
CG6xGxRMYMM,447120,449199,wireless capability which i'll show you
CG6xGxRMYMM,449199,451840,in the exl later on but you can see for
CG6xGxRMYMM,451840,453520,a base screen it's got a volume knob a
CG6xGxRMYMM,453520,455759,tuning knob big hard buttons and it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,455759,457520,all logically laid out and really easy
CG6xGxRMYMM,457520,458960,to use you also get single zone
CG6xGxRMYMM,458960,460800,automatic climate control uh this is the
CG6xGxRMYMM,460800,462000,same kind of design that we've seen in
CG6xGxRMYMM,462000,463360,the new civic and then down here you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,463360,466160,see there's a usb a charging port
CG6xGxRMYMM,466160,467280,a nice little area where you can put
CG6xGxRMYMM,467280,468960,your phone cup holders over here and
CG6xGxRMYMM,468960,471120,then this shifter controls the cvt
CG6xGxRMYMM,471120,472800,transmission which again it's very
CG6xGxRMYMM,472800,474639,traditional looking here's the key fob
CG6xGxRMYMM,474639,476319,for the vehicle you can see we've seen
CG6xGxRMYMM,476319,478240,this key before on other honda products
CG6xGxRMYMM,478240,480080,it's a nice size key even the sport
CG6xGxRMYMM,480080,481680,gives you intelligent access key with
CG6xGxRMYMM,481680,482960,push button start there's even remote
CG6xGxRMYMM,482960,484960,start on the fob itself which is nice
CG6xGxRMYMM,484960,486000,and you can see over here there's a
CG6xGxRMYMM,486000,488000,drive mode selector this car only offers
CG6xGxRMYMM,488000,490960,three modes normal eco and snow
CG6xGxRMYMM,490960,492479,so no sport mode i'm surprised actually
CG6xGxRMYMM,492479,493680,it doesn't have a sport mode but it does
CG6xGxRMYMM,493680,495360,have an s mode in the transmission so
CG6xGxRMYMM,495360,496960,i'll be driving this car in a couple
CG6xGxRMYMM,496960,498000,weeks and we can talk about how it
CG6xGxRMYMM,498000,499680,drives later on i like how honda's gone
CG6xGxRMYMM,499680,501039,with a more traditional center console
CG6xGxRMYMM,501039,502879,here you can see real stitching a nice
CG6xGxRMYMM,502879,504720,padded armrest area over here you have
CG6xGxRMYMM,504720,506400,an electronic parking brake now and then
CG6xGxRMYMM,506400,507599,when you open this up there's a pretty
CG6xGxRMYMM,507599,509199,deep center console storage which is
CG6xGxRMYMM,509199,510560,nice there's also a little bit more
CG6xGxRMYMM,510560,512080,storage over here for your phone you've
CG6xGxRMYMM,512080,515360,got a usb-a two usb-a charging ports uh
CG6xGxRMYMM,515360,517760,or usb-c charging ports on each side of
CG6xGxRMYMM,517760,519039,the lower part of the center console so
CG6xGxRMYMM,519039,521039,that's all fairly nice and then above me
CG6xGxRMYMM,521039,523200,you can see there's even led lighting
CG6xGxRMYMM,523200,524640,all throughout the cabin for the map
CG6xGxRMYMM,524640,526000,lighting and for the rear but let's go
CG6xGxRMYMM,526000,527200,ahead and hop in the exl because i want
CG6xGxRMYMM,527200,529040,to show you guys what the more premium
CG6xGxRMYMM,529040,532240,interior looks like in that trim
CG6xGxRMYMM,532240,534160,so now let's move on to the inside of
CG6xGxRMYMM,534160,536320,the ex l trim remember this is the top
CG6xGxRMYMM,536320,537760,of the line trim for now and getting in
CG6xGxRMYMM,537760,538959,and shutting the door
CG6xGxRMYMM,538959,540800,it has a it still has the same solid
CG6xGxRMYMM,540800,542080,sounding thunk and obviously i want to
CG6xGxRMYMM,542080,544320,point out the differences with the exl
CG6xGxRMYMM,544320,545920,trim now first of all that screen you
CG6xGxRMYMM,545920,547839,can see it's a nine inch display it now
CG6xGxRMYMM,547839,549360,includes wireless apple carplay and
CG6xGxRMYMM,549360,551200,android auto it definitely fills out the
CG6xGxRMYMM,551200,552880,dashboard much better versus the seven
CG6xGxRMYMM,552880,554240,inch screen you still have things like
CG6xGxRMYMM,554240,556000,the volume knob however the tuning knob
CG6xGxRMYMM,556000,557200,is gone instead you just have a tuning
CG6xGxRMYMM,557200,558399,button you can see my phone is now
CG6xGxRMYMM,558399,559839,connected the screen is bright it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,559839,561680,crystal clear it looks great it's also
CG6xGxRMYMM,561680,563120,snappy and responsive this is the same
CG6xGxRMYMM,563120,564640,system that we've tested in the new
CG6xGxRMYMM,564640,566080,civic and i really like it so i'm glad
CG6xGxRMYMM,566080,568000,to see that it's here in the hrv sad you
CG6xGxRMYMM,568000,569680,have to get it in the exl trims you have
CG6xGxRMYMM,569680,571120,to go for the top of the line to get it
CG6xGxRMYMM,571120,573200,if you guys want it but it is a nice
CG6xGxRMYMM,573200,575200,addition when you go for this trim now
CG6xGxRMYMM,575200,576480,looking here at the instrument panel you
CG6xGxRMYMM,576480,578560,can see all hrvs will come with a half
CG6xGxRMYMM,578560,581120,digital half analog cluster you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,581120,582880,the left side of the screen has a
CG6xGxRMYMM,582880,584480,digital display for the tachometer where
CG6xGxRMYMM,584480,586240,it's slightly customizable the right
CG6xGxRMYMM,586240,588080,side has a traditional analog
CG6xGxRMYMM,588080,589519,speedometer that's the same case of
CG6xGxRMYMM,589519,591200,course in the sport trim and in the base
CG6xGxRMYMM,591200,593040,lx it looks nice although i kind of wish
CG6xGxRMYMM,593040,595279,that honda would offer the full digital
CG6xGxRMYMM,595279,597040,display in the civic but there is no
CG6xGxRMYMM,597040,598480,touring trim of this model so i'm not
CG6xGxRMYMM,598480,601200,surprised by that you can see here the
CG6xGxRMYMM,601200,603120,rest of this cabin the seats have a
CG6xGxRMYMM,603120,604800,really nice leather material these are
CG6xGxRMYMM,604800,606480,also three level heated seats no heated
CG6xGxRMYMM,606480,607839,steering wheel but you can see the
CG6xGxRMYMM,607839,609440,driver's seat now becomes an eight-way
CG6xGxRMYMM,609440,611360,power no adjustable lumbar support
CG6xGxRMYMM,611360,613440,however so again you don't find that in
CG6xGxRMYMM,613440,614800,the civic so i'm not surprised that you
CG6xGxRMYMM,614800,616160,don't get that here no memory seats
CG6xGxRMYMM,616160,617680,either but the seats do have a nice high
CG6xGxRMYMM,617680,618480,quality
CG6xGxRMYMM,618480,620399,leather feel which is good and they feel
CG6xGxRMYMM,620399,622160,very comfortable and supportive over
CG6xGxRMYMM,622160,623839,here on the dash design you can see it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,623839,625279,pretty much the same as the sport with
CG6xGxRMYMM,625279,626880,the same lovely materials this really
CG6xGxRMYMM,626880,628480,cool kind of
CG6xGxRMYMM,628480,630720,full length dash vent that come becomes
CG6xGxRMYMM,630720,632399,a design piece of the instrument panel
CG6xGxRMYMM,632399,633839,which looks nice and then over here on
CG6xGxRMYMM,633839,635200,the center stack you can see there's now
CG6xGxRMYMM,635200,636720,dual zone automatic climate control
CG6xGxRMYMM,636720,638880,versus the single zone and you also get
CG6xGxRMYMM,638880,640480,a feature like wireless phone charging
CG6xGxRMYMM,640480,641760,which is great especially when you have
CG6xGxRMYMM,641760,643200,the wireless carplay because you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,643200,644480,basically set your phone over there and
CG6xGxRMYMM,644480,646560,it'll wirelessly charge it uh for those
CG6xGxRMYMM,646560,647600,of you who don't want to deal with all
CG6xGxRMYMM,647600,649120,those wires now opening up the glove box
CG6xGxRMYMM,649120,650800,you can see the glove box is also a bin
CG6xGxRMYMM,650800,652640,style it's damped but it's not lined
CG6xGxRMYMM,652640,653839,with felt it offers a good amount of
CG6xGxRMYMM,653839,655600,space over there and there's also plenty
CG6xGxRMYMM,655600,657200,of room over here and then above me you
CG6xGxRMYMM,657200,658560,can see there's the standard size
CG6xGxRMYMM,658560,660320,sunroof i do wish honda would offer a
CG6xGxRMYMM,660320,662160,panoramic roof but again if you want the
CG6xGxRMYMM,662160,663839,sunroof you have to go for this top of
CG6xGxRMYMM,663839,667440,the line exl trim and up
CG6xGxRMYMM,667440,669440,now because the new hrv is built on
CG6xGxRMYMM,669440,671120,their new global architecture the one
CG6xGxRMYMM,671120,672640,thing that this does lose from the
CG6xGxRMYMM,672640,674480,previous generation is that slick magic
CG6xGxRMYMM,674480,676480,seat however honda has definitely kept a
CG6xGxRMYMM,676480,677920,lot of the room back here and some of
CG6xGxRMYMM,677920,679440,the versatility first of all these seats
CG6xGxRMYMM,679440,681600,they don't flip up anymore however i
CG6xGxRMYMM,681600,683040,notice when i do fold them down you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,683040,684560,see the seat bottom cushion actually
CG6xGxRMYMM,684560,686720,does fold down a little bit and it does
CG6xGxRMYMM,686720,688000,that because it wants to give you a
CG6xGxRMYMM,688000,689839,basically a completely flat load floor
CG6xGxRMYMM,689839,691600,so even though this vehicle doesn't have
CG6xGxRMYMM,691600,693279,that slick magic seat you still have
CG6xGxRMYMM,693279,695120,some versatility and you still have
CG6xGxRMYMM,695120,697519,basically the same cargo figures now
CG6xGxRMYMM,697519,698880,getting back here into the second row
CG6xGxRMYMM,698880,701120,you can see the hrv has always had a
CG6xGxRMYMM,701120,703200,roomy back seat and that is definitely
CG6xGxRMYMM,703200,704800,still the case for the new version
CG6xGxRMYMM,704800,706399,there's actually a flat floor here in
CG6xGxRMYMM,706399,708160,the middle which is surprising i wasn't
CG6xGxRMYMM,708160,709440,expecting that so you can fit three
CG6xGxRMYMM,709440,711040,people across and i don't have the
CG6xGxRMYMM,711040,712560,legroom figures just yet but this
CG6xGxRMYMM,712560,714800,definitely feels at the top of its game
CG6xGxRMYMM,714800,717440,i'd say probably around 38 39 inches of
CG6xGxRMYMM,717440,718800,legroom for somebody that's five foot
CG6xGxRMYMM,718800,721279,seven i have a ton of headroom over here
CG6xGxRMYMM,721279,722720,the sunroof does eat into that space a
CG6xGxRMYMM,722720,724480,little bit but there's a ton of foot
CG6xGxRMYMM,724480,726160,space and there's just a lot of room to
CG6xGxRMYMM,726160,728079,get back here and get comfortable now
CG6xGxRMYMM,728079,729680,overall on the material side you have
CG6xGxRMYMM,729680,731040,hard touch materials here on the door
CG6xGxRMYMM,731040,732800,panel so it's not the same soft touch as
CG6xGxRMYMM,732800,734880,the front but you can see still padded
CG6xGxRMYMM,734880,736160,over here where my elbows would rest
CG6xGxRMYMM,736160,737360,still have kind of like a silver
CG6xGxRMYMM,737360,739680,accented uh door handle and then over
CG6xGxRMYMM,739680,740959,here on the center stack you can see i'm
CG6xGxRMYMM,740959,742720,surprised this exl trim doesn't have
CG6xGxRMYMM,742720,744079,rear seat vents i would have liked to
CG6xGxRMYMM,744079,745760,see rear seat vents i've seen that in
CG6xGxRMYMM,745760,748000,the european version of the hrv no
CG6xGxRMYMM,748000,750880,heated rear seats and no usb ports which
CG6xGxRMYMM,750880,752240,again i wasn't expecting that
CG6xGxRMYMM,752240,754079,considering where this vehicle uh plays
CG6xGxRMYMM,754079,755440,in and what segment plays and then above
CG6xGxRMYMM,755440,757200,me as well you can also see there are
CG6xGxRMYMM,757200,759120,these new map lights back here these map
CG6xGxRMYMM,759120,760959,lights are actually proximity sensor
CG6xGxRMYMM,760959,763360,based which means if i turn them off
CG6xGxRMYMM,763360,764320,here
CG6xGxRMYMM,764320,766320,and then kind of put my hand here that
CG6xGxRMYMM,766320,767680,light actually comes on every time you
CG6xGxRMYMM,767680,768800,kind of get close to that and then it
CG6xGxRMYMM,768800,770079,comes off when you
CG6xGxRMYMM,770079,771600,touch it again so again really cool
CG6xGxRMYMM,771600,773040,feature although i'm surprised it's not
CG6xGxRMYMM,773040,774560,on the front seats but again this is
CG6xGxRMYMM,774560,775600,going to be a cool little feature for
CG6xGxRMYMM,775600,776720,those of you sitting in the back who
CG6xGxRMYMM,776720,778240,need a little bit of light it kind of
CG6xGxRMYMM,778240,780240,reminds me of the last plane that i was
CG6xGxRMYMM,780240,782720,in um over here on the seats you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,782720,784399,they don't recline anymore they just
CG6xGxRMYMM,784399,785760,kind of have a really far recline and
CG6xGxRMYMM,785760,787360,then i was surprised to see that this
CG6xGxRMYMM,787360,789519,ex-l trim doesn't have a fold-down
CG6xGxRMYMM,789519,790639,armrest that would have been nice in
CG6xGxRMYMM,790639,792560,terms of cupholder space
CG6xGxRMYMM,792560,793519,there is
CG6xGxRMYMM,793519,795600,one bottle holder here on the door
CG6xGxRMYMM,795600,796720,and then there's a little bit of storage
CG6xGxRMYMM,796720,798480,over here but it would be nice to see if
CG6xGxRMYMM,798480,800320,honda would add just a rear center
CG6xGxRMYMM,800320,801839,armrest here to give you a little bit
CG6xGxRMYMM,801839,803120,more comfort if you only have two people
CG6xGxRMYMM,803120,804959,in the back seat
CG6xGxRMYMM,804959,806880,now because the new hrv is built off of
CG6xGxRMYMM,806880,808560,the civics platform underneath the hood
CG6xGxRMYMM,808560,810959,we find a new engine the 1.8 liter four
CG6xGxRMYMM,810959,812320,cylinder is gone from the previous
CG6xGxRMYMM,812320,814079,generation it's been replaced by the
CG6xGxRMYMM,814079,816240,2-liter naturally aspirated k-series
CG6xGxRMYMM,816240,818320,motor that we also find in the current
CG6xGxRMYMM,818320,821440,generation civic it makes 158 horsepower
CG6xGxRMYMM,821440,823760,138 pound-feet of torque this engine has
CG6xGxRMYMM,823760,826079,ivtec it's a double overhead cam engine
CG6xGxRMYMM,826079,828800,it is about 11 horsepower stronger uh
CG6xGxRMYMM,828800,830720,versus or i'm sorry 17 horsepower more
CG6xGxRMYMM,830720,832399,versus the previous generation around 11
CG6xGxRMYMM,832399,833760,more pound-feet of torque now i am
CG6xGxRMYMM,833760,836320,surprised to not see the 1.5 liter turbo
CG6xGxRMYMM,836320,837600,under the hood but maybe honda will be
CG6xGxRMYMM,837600,839440,saving that for a later edition in other
CG6xGxRMYMM,839440,841360,markets the company does offer this as a
CG6xGxRMYMM,841360,843519,hybrid especially for the uk market but
CG6xGxRMYMM,843519,845680,again right now in the us we are we are
CG6xGxRMYMM,845680,847760,only get this one 2 liter gas powertrain
CG6xGxRMYMM,847760,849440,it all goes out through a continuously
CG6xGxRMYMM,849440,850800,variable transmission there was a time
CG6xGxRMYMM,850800,852240,where honda used to offer a manual in
CG6xGxRMYMM,852240,854160,the hrv but it just doesn't sell they
CG6xGxRMYMM,854160,856560,stopped offering that back in 2019 and
CG6xGxRMYMM,856560,857760,you can also take your pick between
CG6xGxRMYMM,857760,859279,their front wheel drive or all-wheel
CG6xGxRMYMM,859279,860800,drive with intelligent control it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,860800,862240,their newest all-wheel drive system
CG6xGxRMYMM,862240,863680,honda actually already has fuel economy
CG6xGxRMYMM,863680,864959,figures already for the front wheel
CG6xGxRMYMM,864959,866880,drive model it's rated at 26 in the city
CG6xGxRMYMM,866880,868480,and 32 on the highway that's on regular
CG6xGxRMYMM,868480,870079,gas this all-wheel drive version is
CG6xGxRMYMM,870079,872399,slightly lower at 25 in the city and 30
CG6xGxRMYMM,872399,873519,on the highway we don't know what the
CG6xGxRMYMM,873519,875120,zero 60 performance is yet we also don't
CG6xGxRMYMM,875120,876560,know the curb weight or whether this
CG6xGxRMYMM,876560,878320,vehicle will tell or not but we will be
CG6xGxRMYMM,878320,879920,driving this car in a couple weeks so be
CG6xGxRMYMM,879920,881519,sure to stay tuned for our video that
CG6xGxRMYMM,881519,883680,has the full on driving impressions so
CG6xGxRMYMM,883680,885519,because the new hrv is built off of a
CG6xGxRMYMM,885519,887519,global platform that also underpins the
CG6xGxRMYMM,887519,889839,civic this vehicle is significantly more
CG6xGxRMYMM,889839,891600,upscale for the u.s market it's more
CG6xGxRMYMM,891600,893519,powerful it's more spacious it's more
CG6xGxRMYMM,893519,895760,stylish and it's more tech heavy
CG6xGxRMYMM,895760,897120,especially when you look at the safety
CG6xGxRMYMM,897120,899279,tech honda's sensing driver assistance
CG6xGxRMYMM,899279,900880,is now standard on every trim and it
CG6xGxRMYMM,900880,902240,adds new features like traffic jam
CG6xGxRMYMM,902240,903600,assistant and i've also forgot to
CG6xGxRMYMM,903600,905120,mention because this is now on a new
CG6xGxRMYMM,905120,906720,platform it also has an independent rear
CG6xGxRMYMM,906720,908480,suspension which should significantly
CG6xGxRMYMM,908480,910639,improve the ride and handling of this
CG6xGxRMYMM,910639,912320,vehicle now in terms of the exterior
CG6xGxRMYMM,912320,914000,styling i wasn't so sure about the way
CG6xGxRMYMM,914000,915760,it looked in the photos however after
CG6xGxRMYMM,915760,917760,seeing it in person particularly in the
CG6xGxRMYMM,917760,919279,sport trim with the black wheels i think
CG6xGxRMYMM,919279,921680,the new hrv is really upscale looking i
CG6xGxRMYMM,921680,923040,really like the lines of this vehicle
CG6xGxRMYMM,923040,924480,it's introducing kind of a new design
CG6xGxRMYMM,924480,926240,language for honda and from certain
CG6xGxRMYMM,926240,927839,angles especially at the rear we see
CG6xGxRMYMM,927839,929839,some acura influence in the design it
CG6xGxRMYMM,929839,932079,almost looks like a baby acura suv which
CG6xGxRMYMM,932079,933519,is probably what honda was going for
CG6xGxRMYMM,933519,935279,especially with the overall length of
CG6xGxRMYMM,935279,936720,this car it's significantly larger and
CG6xGxRMYMM,936720,938160,as you guys saw it gives you way more
CG6xGxRMYMM,938160,940079,space on the inside now if you guys are
CG6xGxRMYMM,940079,942000,looking to purchase the new hrv it will
CG6xGxRMYMM,942000,944079,be going on sale in june so basically in
CG6xGxRMYMM,944079,946480,a month uh this is going to basically be
CG6xGxRMYMM,946480,947680,a little bit more expensive versus the
CG6xGxRMYMM,947680,948880,previous generation i expected that
CG6xGxRMYMM,948880,950240,because of all the new tech this car
CG6xGxRMYMM,950240,953600,starts at 23 650 for the base lx at
CG6xGxRMYMM,953600,955920,about 1400 if you guys want all-wheel
CG6xGxRMYMM,955920,958160,drive that's about 2 000 more versus the
CG6xGxRMYMM,958160,959759,previous generation which sounds fair
CG6xGxRMYMM,959759,961519,because of all the new tech and the
CG6xGxRMYMM,961519,963440,extra power that this car comes equipped
CG6xGxRMYMM,963440,964800,with that sport model over there is
CG6xGxRMYMM,964800,967040,about two grand more versus the lx at 25
CG6xGxRMYMM,967040,969839,650. this exl with all-wheel drive is
CG6xGxRMYMM,969839,972399,around 28 950 remember that pricing is
CG6xGxRMYMM,972399,974079,plus the 1200 destination charge so
CG6xGxRMYMM,974079,976079,you're looking at just over 30 grand for
CG6xGxRMYMM,976079,977680,this fully loaded model that is more
CG6xGxRMYMM,977680,979440,expensive than the old one however with
CG6xGxRMYMM,979440,981519,all the increased room efficiency tech
CG6xGxRMYMM,981519,983759,and premium touches it is still very
CG6xGxRMYMM,983759,985040,well priced and it's still a little bit
CG6xGxRMYMM,985040,986639,less expensive than most of the
CG6xGxRMYMM,986639,988000,competition but with all that said hope
CG6xGxRMYMM,988000,989920,you guys have enjoyed my very in-depth

CG6xGxRMYMM,1018720,1020800,you
vid,start,end,text
CG6xGxRMYMM,399,2320,about seven years ago honda expanded
CG6xGxRMYMM,2320,4240,their suv family in america with the
CG6xGxRMYMM,4240,7040,subcompact hrv now at the time the
CG6xGxRMYMM,7040,8639,subcompact segment was still in its
CG6xGxRMYMM,8639,10480,infancy and since then a ton of new
CG6xGxRMYMM,10480,12240,competitors have shown up which is why
CG6xGxRMYMM,12240,13759,i'm at the jam handy studio here in
CG6xGxRMYMM,13759,15360,detroit michigan show you guys the
CG6xGxRMYMM,15360,17600,completely redesigned second generation
CG6xGxRMYMM,17600,19840,hrv it's now built off of the new civics
CG6xGxRMYMM,19840,21840,platform which means it's larger more
CG6xGxRMYMM,21840,24000,powerful more stylish and at a starting
CG6xGxRMYMM,24000,26480,price of well under 25 000 it's still
CG6xGxRMYMM,26480,28640,really affordable so let's take a first
CG6xGxRMYMM,28640,31640,look
CG6xGxRMYMM,36680,38160,[Music]
CG6xGxRMYMM,38160,39920,so with the honda fit no longer in
CG6xGxRMYMM,39920,42079,honda's north american lineup the hrv is
CG6xGxRMYMM,42079,44800,now the entry level point into the honda
CG6xGxRMYMM,44800,46640,brand and i have to say this all new
CG6xGxRMYMM,46640,48239,version being built off of the civic
CG6xGxRMYMM,48239,49760,platform means it's a much larger
CG6xGxRMYMM,49760,51520,vehicle it's a much more premium vehicle
CG6xGxRMYMM,51520,53360,and as you can see the styling direction
CG6xGxRMYMM,53360,55440,of this suv has i haven't really seen on
CG6xGxRMYMM,55440,57120,any other honda suv before honda is
CG6xGxRMYMM,57120,58800,going to be working on a bunch of new
CG6xGxRMYMM,58800,60719,suvs in the coming years you should be
CG6xGxRMYMM,60719,62719,seeing a new version the crv the pilot
CG6xGxRMYMM,62719,64158,the passport at some point but since
CG6xGxRMYMM,64158,65439,we're talking about the hrv let's go
CG6xGxRMYMM,65439,67119,ahead and focus on this all new
CG6xGxRMYMM,67119,68799,subcompact suv now first of all i've got
CG6xGxRMYMM,68799,70320,two trim levels here this is the sport
CG6xGxRMYMM,70320,72000,trim which is kind of the mid-grade and
CG6xGxRMYMM,72000,73920,there's also the top of the line ex-l
CG6xGxRMYMM,73920,75600,there's also a bass lx trim but i don't
CG6xGxRMYMM,75600,77280,have that here to show you guys today
CG6xGxRMYMM,77280,78400,but as you can see let's start with the
CG6xGxRMYMM,78400,79920,sport trim because the design language
CG6xGxRMYMM,79920,81840,here that i'm seeing is definitely very
CG6xGxRMYMM,81840,83200,interesting i mean the headlights have
CG6xGxRMYMM,83200,84960,that kind of skinny look that we've seen
CG6xGxRMYMM,84960,86240,on the new civic what i do like about
CG6xGxRMYMM,86240,88880,this new hrv is full led headlights come
CG6xGxRMYMM,88880,90320,standard you can see there's an led low
CG6xGxRMYMM,90320,91840,and high beam and led daytime running
CG6xGxRMYMM,91840,93759,light and even an led turn signal very
CG6xGxRMYMM,93759,95280,premium look if you guys remember the
CG6xGxRMYMM,95280,96880,previous generation hrv honda didn't
CG6xGxRMYMM,96880,99200,even offer led headlights except on the
CG6xGxRMYMM,99200,100320,touring trim which they actually
CG6xGxRMYMM,100320,102880,discontinued back in 2020. you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,102880,105119,this sport trim has kind of like a
CG6xGxRMYMM,105119,107200,matte finish black in the grill with
CG6xGxRMYMM,107200,108720,these more aggressive air intakes there
CG6xGxRMYMM,108720,110000,are no fog lights in the vehicle you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,110000,110960,see a lot of the vents that you're
CG6xGxRMYMM,110960,112159,seeing around the front fascia of the
CG6xGxRMYMM,112159,113680,vehicle are actually functional the
CG6xGxRMYMM,113680,115360,grille also looks interesting because
CG6xGxRMYMM,115360,117200,the honda emblem is actually above it
CG6xGxRMYMM,117200,118320,again it doesn't look like any other
CG6xGxRMYMM,118320,120000,honda suv that i've seen before so it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,120000,121759,got a completely new design language
CG6xGxRMYMM,121759,123280,this color on this sport trim is called
CG6xGxRMYMM,123280,124960,urban gray metallic it's a really nice
CG6xGxRMYMM,124960,127600,exterior color it goes again with the um
CG6xGxRMYMM,127600,129039,trends that people are seeing with a lot
CG6xGxRMYMM,129039,130319,of these colors now let's move over to
CG6xGxRMYMM,130319,132239,the exl trend because this is the higher
CG6xGxRMYMM,132239,133520,trim it's the top of the line for now
CG6xGxRMYMM,133520,135200,there is no touring trim you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,135200,136400,there's some slight differences in the
CG6xGxRMYMM,136400,138000,front fascia versus the sport you have a
CG6xGxRMYMM,138000,140080,gloss black grille and the lower front
CG6xGxRMYMM,140080,141840,skirt you have kind of similar air
CG6xGxRMYMM,141840,143760,intakes which are all functional even on
CG6xGxRMYMM,143760,145520,the exl no fog lights but you can see i
CG6xGxRMYMM,145520,146560,like how some of the vents here are
CG6xGxRMYMM,146560,147840,functional the headlights look
CG6xGxRMYMM,147840,149200,practically the same there's also
CG6xGxRMYMM,149200,151200,parking sensors on the exl so again a
CG6xGxRMYMM,151200,152800,lot of premium touches that you
CG6xGxRMYMM,152800,154879,typically don't find in this segment of
CG6xGxRMYMM,154879,156319,vehicle now moving over to the side of
CG6xGxRMYMM,156319,157920,the vehicle because it's now built off
CG6xGxRMYMM,157920,160080,of the civics platform the new hrv is
CG6xGxRMYMM,160080,161920,significantly larger i'm talking about
CG6xGxRMYMM,161920,164560,8.7 inches longer in overall length so
CG6xGxRMYMM,164560,166879,around 179 inches long this is almost
CG6xGxRMYMM,166879,168879,the same size as the current generation
CG6xGxRMYMM,168879,170800,honda crvs which is going to make the
CG6xGxRMYMM,170800,172879,hrv bigger than most of the competition
CG6xGxRMYMM,172879,173920,it's going to give us probably
CG6xGxRMYMM,173920,175840,best-in-class rear seat legroom and
CG6xGxRMYMM,175840,178000,cargo figures now looking at the wheels
CG6xGxRMYMM,178000,179840,you can see this exl version has a
CG6xGxRMYMM,179840,181840,17-inch wheel with kind of a two-tone
CG6xGxRMYMM,181840,183760,machine look to it with some all-season
CG6xGxRMYMM,183760,185680,tires i don't have the ground clearance
CG6xGxRMYMM,185680,187599,specifications yet but you can see this
CG6xGxRMYMM,187599,189280,one's all-wheel drive it should be right
CG6xGxRMYMM,189280,190640,around seven inches i believe that's
CG6xGxRMYMM,190640,191840,what the old one had you can see there's
CG6xGxRMYMM,191840,194959,some gloss black for the fenders
CG6xGxRMYMM,194959,196319,which kind of look well with the rest of
CG6xGxRMYMM,196319,197840,the body you can see the exl includes
CG6xGxRMYMM,197840,199920,body colored mirrors with side mirror
CG6xGxRMYMM,199920,201680,turn indicators and then you also get a
CG6xGxRMYMM,201680,203280,sunroof if you guys want a sunroof it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,203280,204799,just a standard sunroof and you have to
CG6xGxRMYMM,204799,207040,go for the exl trim to get it its
CG6xGxRMYMM,207040,209760,wheelbase is around 104.5 inches long so
CG6xGxRMYMM,209760,211200,it's about two inches longer and the
CG6xGxRMYMM,211200,212799,vehicle itself is about the same height
CG6xGxRMYMM,212799,214239,but it's also about two and a half
CG6xGxRMYMM,214239,216239,inches wider so this is going to give us
CG6xGxRMYMM,216239,218080,again way more interior space and that's
CG6xGxRMYMM,218080,219519,something that americans tend to really
CG6xGxRMYMM,219519,221360,want especially in this segment of
CG6xGxRMYMM,221360,222640,vehicle now looking at the rear let me
CG6xGxRMYMM,222640,223680,show you guys
CG6xGxRMYMM,223680,225440,the rear of this vehicle the lights you
CG6xGxRMYMM,225440,227440,can see kind of look like
CG6xGxRMYMM,227440,228640,the previous generation a little bit to
CG6xGxRMYMM,228640,230159,me but they've been updated
CG6xGxRMYMM,230159,232080,way more modern you have full led tail
CG6xGxRMYMM,232080,234000,lights with an led turn signal led
CG6xGxRMYMM,234000,235439,reverse light led brake light you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,235439,237680,see more gloss black on the rear with
CG6xGxRMYMM,237680,239439,the bumper with the rear bumper cover
CG6xGxRMYMM,239439,240400,and then you also have these well
CG6xGxRMYMM,240400,242080,integrated parking sensors as well and
CG6xGxRMYMM,242080,243680,then in terms of the cargo the one thing
CG6xGxRMYMM,243680,245280,i'm surprised to see is there's no power
CG6xGxRMYMM,245280,246959,liftgate although most vehicles in this
CG6xGxRMYMM,246959,248560,segment don't typically offer it i
CG6xGxRMYMM,248560,250400,believe only mazda is one that comes to
CG6xGxRMYMM,250400,251519,mind where they offer that but you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,251519,253519,see in terms of the cargo space you
CG6xGxRMYMM,253519,255439,still have best in class honda says
CG6xGxRMYMM,255439,257519,there's roughly just under 25 cubic feet
CG6xGxRMYMM,257519,259120,of space with the second row seats up
CG6xGxRMYMM,259120,261040,there's also some underfloor storage
CG6xGxRMYMM,261040,262160,over here if you want to hide some
CG6xGxRMYMM,262160,263440,things and then you can see here there's
CG6xGxRMYMM,263440,265040,also a temporary spare tire so you don't
CG6xGxRMYMM,265040,266960,have to deal with the fix flat kit and
CG6xGxRMYMM,266960,268720,then if you fold down these seats which
CG6xGxRMYMM,268720,270639,you can kind of do pretty easily from
CG6xGxRMYMM,270639,271680,back here
CG6xGxRMYMM,271680,272800,these seats actually fold down and
CG6xGxRMYMM,272800,274639,almost give you a completely flat load
CG6xGxRMYMM,274639,276000,floor and when you fold those down it
CG6xGxRMYMM,276000,278160,expands it out to around 55 cubic feet
CG6xGxRMYMM,278160,280080,which is actually about the same as the
CG6xGxRMYMM,280080,281360,previous generation because remember the
CG6xGxRMYMM,281360,283120,previous generation was based off of the
CG6xGxRMYMM,283120,284960,honda fit platform which offered that
CG6xGxRMYMM,284960,286160,magic seat now let me show you guys
CG6xGxRMYMM,286160,287600,really quick this sport trim over here
CG6xGxRMYMM,287600,289440,because the sport trim has a larger
CG6xGxRMYMM,289440,291680,wheel you can see the 18 inch wheel on
CG6xGxRMYMM,291680,293840,this trim has a gloss black finish to it
CG6xGxRMYMM,293840,295520,there's more like a burling berliner
CG6xGxRMYMM,295520,297199,black finish to it you can see it looks
CG6xGxRMYMM,297199,298560,really good especially with the body
CG6xGxRMYMM,298560,300240,lines of the sport model you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,300240,302479,unlike the aexl which had gloss black
CG6xGxRMYMM,302479,304400,this is kind of a flat black the side
CG6xGxRMYMM,304400,305840,mirrors are also black painted and then
CG6xGxRMYMM,305840,308160,you also get this black painted roof
CG6xGxRMYMM,308160,309840,spoiler at the back which definitely
CG6xGxRMYMM,309840,311600,makes it look a little bit more sporty
CG6xGxRMYMM,311600,313440,even though this is the lower end trim
CG6xGxRMYMM,313440,314960,you still get the premium touches like
CG6xGxRMYMM,314960,316320,the full led tail lights you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,316320,318240,it's got an led turn signal there's a
CG6xGxRMYMM,318240,320320,large black sport badge here which i
CG6xGxRMYMM,320320,321520,believe is going to be part of a dealer
CG6xGxRMYMM,321520,323280,accessory and then unlike the xl it also
CG6xGxRMYMM,323280,324960,gives you a nice chrome exhaust finisher
CG6xGxRMYMM,324960,326240,which looks really nice although it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,326240,328320,just on one side remember this engine or
CG6xGxRMYMM,328320,330080,this vehicle only comes with one engine
CG6xGxRMYMM,330080,331360,choice and then if you open up the cargo
CG6xGxRMYMM,331360,333039,area still no power liftgate but the
CG6xGxRMYMM,333039,334880,space is practically the same and the
CG6xGxRMYMM,334880,336960,interior of this vehicle also looks
CG6xGxRMYMM,336960,338400,really nice as well with the cloth and
CG6xGxRMYMM,338400,341199,the orange stitching
CG6xGxRMYMM,341199,342880,so now let's finally take a look at the
CG6xGxRMYMM,342880,345360,inside of the completely redesigned hrv
CG6xGxRMYMM,345360,346639,now i'm going to first start off in the
CG6xGxRMYMM,346639,348320,sport trim because this is the lower end
CG6xGxRMYMM,348320,349759,and we'll hop into the exl and show you
CG6xGxRMYMM,349759,351039,guys what the top trim looks like now
CG6xGxRMYMM,351039,352240,first of all getting inside and shutting
CG6xGxRMYMM,352240,353600,the door
CG6xGxRMYMM,353600,355280,the door has a nice solid sounding thunk
CG6xGxRMYMM,355280,356960,remember this is built off of the 11th
CG6xGxRMYMM,356960,358960,generation civic platform i have to say
CG6xGxRMYMM,358960,360560,first getting inside the interior this
CG6xGxRMYMM,360560,362240,is the sport model the lower end version
CG6xGxRMYMM,362240,364560,it still has a very premium feel the
CG6xGxRMYMM,364560,365919,seats you can see on the sport have this
CG6xGxRMYMM,365919,368000,kind of sport cloth texture with the
CG6xGxRMYMM,368000,369600,orange accent stitching the driver's
CG6xGxRMYMM,369600,371199,seat has a six-way manual adjustment
CG6xGxRMYMM,371199,372800,just a four-way manual on this side for
CG6xGxRMYMM,372800,374560,the passenger no heated or actually i'm
CG6xGxRMYMM,374560,376160,sorry it does have heated seats even for
CG6xGxRMYMM,376160,377759,the sport so i'm assuming the lx is the
CG6xGxRMYMM,377759,379199,one that doesn't give you that feature
CG6xGxRMYMM,379199,380479,but you can see here also the steering
CG6xGxRMYMM,380479,381919,wheel comes directly off of the new
CG6xGxRMYMM,381919,383600,civic with the gloss black accents the
CG6xGxRMYMM,383600,386160,orange stitching it does offer a tilt
CG6xGxRMYMM,386160,387840,and telescoping ability with a pretty
CG6xGxRMYMM,387840,389759,good amount of adjustability and for an
CG6xGxRMYMM,389759,391360,entry-level model or basically an
CG6xGxRMYMM,391360,393120,entry-level model the materials in here
CG6xGxRMYMM,393120,394880,are really fantastic i mean the design
CG6xGxRMYMM,394880,396800,of the interior looks a lot like the
CG6xGxRMYMM,396800,398560,current generation civic the door panel
CG6xGxRMYMM,398560,400000,you can see has a soft touch injection
CG6xGxRMYMM,400000,401360,molded plastic
CG6xGxRMYMM,401360,402880,over here on this panel here it is
CG6xGxRMYMM,402880,404240,slightly hard touch but at least it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,404240,405600,padded down here where my elbows would
CG6xGxRMYMM,405600,407520,rest the windows are one touch up and
CG6xGxRMYMM,407520,409440,down for both front windows however not
CG6xGxRMYMM,409440,411280,for the rear they have that high quality
CG6xGxRMYMM,411280,413120,tactile feel that we've experienced in
CG6xGxRMYMM,413120,414639,some of the newer honda products and
CG6xGxRMYMM,414639,416240,then over here on the dash you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,416240,417680,this is a soft touch injection molded
CG6xGxRMYMM,417680,419360,plastic this is even a padded area here
CG6xGxRMYMM,419360,420720,where this is kind of like a leatherette
CG6xGxRMYMM,420720,422479,material with some genuine stitching and
CG6xGxRMYMM,422479,424080,it actually is accentuated over here on
CG6xGxRMYMM,424080,425680,the center console which by the way the
CG6xGxRMYMM,425680,426720,center console has been completely
CG6xGxRMYMM,426720,427919,redesigned i'll get to that in just a
CG6xGxRMYMM,427919,429520,moment now this is the base screen that
CG6xGxRMYMM,429520,431520,you get on the lx and the sport it's a
CG6xGxRMYMM,431520,433919,7-inch touchscreen display it does have
CG6xGxRMYMM,433919,435759,android auto and apple carplay and it
CG6xGxRMYMM,435759,437280,also has a backup camera of course if
CG6xGxRMYMM,437280,438479,you put into
CG6xGxRMYMM,438479,439759,reverse it gives you three different
CG6xGxRMYMM,439759,441199,angles and views it has rear cross
CG6xGxRMYMM,441199,442960,traffic alert the backup camera itself
CG6xGxRMYMM,442960,445520,looks pretty fine no 360 camera but this
CG6xGxRMYMM,445520,447120,is the smaller display it is lacking
CG6xGxRMYMM,447120,449199,wireless capability which i'll show you
CG6xGxRMYMM,449199,451840,in the exl later on but you can see for
CG6xGxRMYMM,451840,453520,a base screen it's got a volume knob a
CG6xGxRMYMM,453520,455759,tuning knob big hard buttons and it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,455759,457520,all logically laid out and really easy
CG6xGxRMYMM,457520,458960,to use you also get single zone
CG6xGxRMYMM,458960,460800,automatic climate control uh this is the
CG6xGxRMYMM,460800,462000,same kind of design that we've seen in
CG6xGxRMYMM,462000,463360,the new civic and then down here you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,463360,466160,see there's a usb a charging port
CG6xGxRMYMM,466160,467280,a nice little area where you can put
CG6xGxRMYMM,467280,468960,your phone cup holders over here and
CG6xGxRMYMM,468960,471120,then this shifter controls the cvt
CG6xGxRMYMM,471120,472800,transmission which again it's very
CG6xGxRMYMM,472800,474639,traditional looking here's the key fob
CG6xGxRMYMM,474639,476319,for the vehicle you can see we've seen
CG6xGxRMYMM,476319,478240,this key before on other honda products
CG6xGxRMYMM,478240,480080,it's a nice size key even the sport
CG6xGxRMYMM,480080,481680,gives you intelligent access key with
CG6xGxRMYMM,481680,482960,push button start there's even remote
CG6xGxRMYMM,482960,484960,start on the fob itself which is nice
CG6xGxRMYMM,484960,486000,and you can see over here there's a
CG6xGxRMYMM,486000,488000,drive mode selector this car only offers
CG6xGxRMYMM,488000,490960,three modes normal eco and snow
CG6xGxRMYMM,490960,492479,so no sport mode i'm surprised actually
CG6xGxRMYMM,492479,493680,it doesn't have a sport mode but it does
CG6xGxRMYMM,493680,495360,have an s mode in the transmission so
CG6xGxRMYMM,495360,496960,i'll be driving this car in a couple
CG6xGxRMYMM,496960,498000,weeks and we can talk about how it
CG6xGxRMYMM,498000,499680,drives later on i like how honda's gone
CG6xGxRMYMM,499680,501039,with a more traditional center console
CG6xGxRMYMM,501039,502879,here you can see real stitching a nice
CG6xGxRMYMM,502879,504720,padded armrest area over here you have
CG6xGxRMYMM,504720,506400,an electronic parking brake now and then
CG6xGxRMYMM,506400,507599,when you open this up there's a pretty
CG6xGxRMYMM,507599,509199,deep center console storage which is
CG6xGxRMYMM,509199,510560,nice there's also a little bit more
CG6xGxRMYMM,510560,512080,storage over here for your phone you've
CG6xGxRMYMM,512080,515360,got a usb-a two usb-a charging ports uh
CG6xGxRMYMM,515360,517760,or usb-c charging ports on each side of
CG6xGxRMYMM,517760,519039,the lower part of the center console so
CG6xGxRMYMM,519039,521039,that's all fairly nice and then above me
CG6xGxRMYMM,521039,523200,you can see there's even led lighting
CG6xGxRMYMM,523200,524640,all throughout the cabin for the map
CG6xGxRMYMM,524640,526000,lighting and for the rear but let's go
CG6xGxRMYMM,526000,527200,ahead and hop in the exl because i want
CG6xGxRMYMM,527200,529040,to show you guys what the more premium
CG6xGxRMYMM,529040,532240,interior looks like in that trim
CG6xGxRMYMM,532240,534160,so now let's move on to the inside of
CG6xGxRMYMM,534160,536320,the ex l trim remember this is the top
CG6xGxRMYMM,536320,537760,of the line trim for now and getting in
CG6xGxRMYMM,537760,538959,and shutting the door
CG6xGxRMYMM,538959,540800,it has a it still has the same solid
CG6xGxRMYMM,540800,542080,sounding thunk and obviously i want to
CG6xGxRMYMM,542080,544320,point out the differences with the exl
CG6xGxRMYMM,544320,545920,trim now first of all that screen you
CG6xGxRMYMM,545920,547839,can see it's a nine inch display it now
CG6xGxRMYMM,547839,549360,includes wireless apple carplay and
CG6xGxRMYMM,549360,551200,android auto it definitely fills out the
CG6xGxRMYMM,551200,552880,dashboard much better versus the seven
CG6xGxRMYMM,552880,554240,inch screen you still have things like
CG6xGxRMYMM,554240,556000,the volume knob however the tuning knob
CG6xGxRMYMM,556000,557200,is gone instead you just have a tuning
CG6xGxRMYMM,557200,558399,button you can see my phone is now
CG6xGxRMYMM,558399,559839,connected the screen is bright it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,559839,561680,crystal clear it looks great it's also
CG6xGxRMYMM,561680,563120,snappy and responsive this is the same
CG6xGxRMYMM,563120,564640,system that we've tested in the new
CG6xGxRMYMM,564640,566080,civic and i really like it so i'm glad
CG6xGxRMYMM,566080,568000,to see that it's here in the hrv sad you
CG6xGxRMYMM,568000,569680,have to get it in the exl trims you have
CG6xGxRMYMM,569680,571120,to go for the top of the line to get it
CG6xGxRMYMM,571120,573200,if you guys want it but it is a nice
CG6xGxRMYMM,573200,575200,addition when you go for this trim now
CG6xGxRMYMM,575200,576480,looking here at the instrument panel you
CG6xGxRMYMM,576480,578560,can see all hrvs will come with a half
CG6xGxRMYMM,578560,581120,digital half analog cluster you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,581120,582880,the left side of the screen has a
CG6xGxRMYMM,582880,584480,digital display for the tachometer where
CG6xGxRMYMM,584480,586240,it's slightly customizable the right
CG6xGxRMYMM,586240,588080,side has a traditional analog
CG6xGxRMYMM,588080,589519,speedometer that's the same case of
CG6xGxRMYMM,589519,591200,course in the sport trim and in the base
CG6xGxRMYMM,591200,593040,lx it looks nice although i kind of wish
CG6xGxRMYMM,593040,595279,that honda would offer the full digital
CG6xGxRMYMM,595279,597040,display in the civic but there is no
CG6xGxRMYMM,597040,598480,touring trim of this model so i'm not
CG6xGxRMYMM,598480,601200,surprised by that you can see here the
CG6xGxRMYMM,601200,603120,rest of this cabin the seats have a
CG6xGxRMYMM,603120,604800,really nice leather material these are
CG6xGxRMYMM,604800,606480,also three level heated seats no heated
CG6xGxRMYMM,606480,607839,steering wheel but you can see the
CG6xGxRMYMM,607839,609440,driver's seat now becomes an eight-way
CG6xGxRMYMM,609440,611360,power no adjustable lumbar support
CG6xGxRMYMM,611360,613440,however so again you don't find that in
CG6xGxRMYMM,613440,614800,the civic so i'm not surprised that you
CG6xGxRMYMM,614800,616160,don't get that here no memory seats
CG6xGxRMYMM,616160,617680,either but the seats do have a nice high
CG6xGxRMYMM,617680,618480,quality
CG6xGxRMYMM,618480,620399,leather feel which is good and they feel
CG6xGxRMYMM,620399,622160,very comfortable and supportive over
CG6xGxRMYMM,622160,623839,here on the dash design you can see it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,623839,625279,pretty much the same as the sport with
CG6xGxRMYMM,625279,626880,the same lovely materials this really
CG6xGxRMYMM,626880,628480,cool kind of
CG6xGxRMYMM,628480,630720,full length dash vent that come becomes
CG6xGxRMYMM,630720,632399,a design piece of the instrument panel
CG6xGxRMYMM,632399,633839,which looks nice and then over here on
CG6xGxRMYMM,633839,635200,the center stack you can see there's now
CG6xGxRMYMM,635200,636720,dual zone automatic climate control
CG6xGxRMYMM,636720,638880,versus the single zone and you also get
CG6xGxRMYMM,638880,640480,a feature like wireless phone charging
CG6xGxRMYMM,640480,641760,which is great especially when you have
CG6xGxRMYMM,641760,643200,the wireless carplay because you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,643200,644480,basically set your phone over there and
CG6xGxRMYMM,644480,646560,it'll wirelessly charge it uh for those
CG6xGxRMYMM,646560,647600,of you who don't want to deal with all
CG6xGxRMYMM,647600,649120,those wires now opening up the glove box
CG6xGxRMYMM,649120,650800,you can see the glove box is also a bin
CG6xGxRMYMM,650800,652640,style it's damped but it's not lined
CG6xGxRMYMM,652640,653839,with felt it offers a good amount of
CG6xGxRMYMM,653839,655600,space over there and there's also plenty
CG6xGxRMYMM,655600,657200,of room over here and then above me you
CG6xGxRMYMM,657200,658560,can see there's the standard size
CG6xGxRMYMM,658560,660320,sunroof i do wish honda would offer a
CG6xGxRMYMM,660320,662160,panoramic roof but again if you want the
CG6xGxRMYMM,662160,663839,sunroof you have to go for this top of
CG6xGxRMYMM,663839,667440,the line exl trim and up
CG6xGxRMYMM,667440,669440,now because the new hrv is built on
CG6xGxRMYMM,669440,671120,their new global architecture the one
CG6xGxRMYMM,671120,672640,thing that this does lose from the
CG6xGxRMYMM,672640,674480,previous generation is that slick magic
CG6xGxRMYMM,674480,676480,seat however honda has definitely kept a
CG6xGxRMYMM,676480,677920,lot of the room back here and some of
CG6xGxRMYMM,677920,679440,the versatility first of all these seats
CG6xGxRMYMM,679440,681600,they don't flip up anymore however i
CG6xGxRMYMM,681600,683040,notice when i do fold them down you can
CG6xGxRMYMM,683040,684560,see the seat bottom cushion actually
CG6xGxRMYMM,684560,686720,does fold down a little bit and it does
CG6xGxRMYMM,686720,688000,that because it wants to give you a
CG6xGxRMYMM,688000,689839,basically a completely flat load floor
CG6xGxRMYMM,689839,691600,so even though this vehicle doesn't have
CG6xGxRMYMM,691600,693279,that slick magic seat you still have
CG6xGxRMYMM,693279,695120,some versatility and you still have
CG6xGxRMYMM,695120,697519,basically the same cargo figures now
CG6xGxRMYMM,697519,698880,getting back here into the second row
CG6xGxRMYMM,698880,701120,you can see the hrv has always had a
CG6xGxRMYMM,701120,703200,roomy back seat and that is definitely
CG6xGxRMYMM,703200,704800,still the case for the new version
CG6xGxRMYMM,704800,706399,there's actually a flat floor here in
CG6xGxRMYMM,706399,708160,the middle which is surprising i wasn't
CG6xGxRMYMM,708160,709440,expecting that so you can fit three
CG6xGxRMYMM,709440,711040,people across and i don't have the
CG6xGxRMYMM,711040,712560,legroom figures just yet but this
CG6xGxRMYMM,712560,714800,definitely feels at the top of its game
CG6xGxRMYMM,714800,717440,i'd say probably around 38 39 inches of
CG6xGxRMYMM,717440,718800,legroom for somebody that's five foot
CG6xGxRMYMM,718800,721279,seven i have a ton of headroom over here
CG6xGxRMYMM,721279,722720,the sunroof does eat into that space a
CG6xGxRMYMM,722720,724480,little bit but there's a ton of foot
CG6xGxRMYMM,724480,726160,space and there's just a lot of room to
CG6xGxRMYMM,726160,728079,get back here and get comfortable now
CG6xGxRMYMM,728079,729680,overall on the material side you have
CG6xGxRMYMM,729680,731040,hard touch materials here on the door
CG6xGxRMYMM,731040,732800,panel so it's not the same soft touch as
CG6xGxRMYMM,732800,734880,the front but you can see still padded
CG6xGxRMYMM,734880,736160,over here where my elbows would rest
CG6xGxRMYMM,736160,737360,still have kind of like a silver
CG6xGxRMYMM,737360,739680,accented uh door handle and then over
CG6xGxRMYMM,739680,740959,here on the center stack you can see i'm
CG6xGxRMYMM,740959,742720,surprised this exl trim doesn't have
CG6xGxRMYMM,742720,744079,rear seat vents i would have liked to
CG6xGxRMYMM,744079,745760,see rear seat vents i've seen that in
CG6xGxRMYMM,745760,748000,the european version of the hrv no
CG6xGxRMYMM,748000,750880,heated rear seats and no usb ports which
CG6xGxRMYMM,750880,752240,again i wasn't expecting that
CG6xGxRMYMM,752240,754079,considering where this vehicle uh plays
CG6xGxRMYMM,754079,755440,in and what segment plays and then above
CG6xGxRMYMM,755440,757200,me as well you can also see there are
CG6xGxRMYMM,757200,759120,these new map lights back here these map
CG6xGxRMYMM,759120,760959,lights are actually proximity sensor
CG6xGxRMYMM,760959,763360,based which means if i turn them off
CG6xGxRMYMM,763360,764320,here
CG6xGxRMYMM,764320,766320,and then kind of put my hand here that
CG6xGxRMYMM,766320,767680,light actually comes on every time you
CG6xGxRMYMM,767680,768800,kind of get close to that and then it
CG6xGxRMYMM,768800,770079,comes off when you
CG6xGxRMYMM,770079,771600,touch it again so again really cool
CG6xGxRMYMM,771600,773040,feature although i'm surprised it's not
CG6xGxRMYMM,773040,774560,on the front seats but again this is
CG6xGxRMYMM,774560,775600,going to be a cool little feature for
CG6xGxRMYMM,775600,776720,those of you sitting in the back who
CG6xGxRMYMM,776720,778240,need a little bit of light it kind of
CG6xGxRMYMM,778240,780240,reminds me of the last plane that i was
CG6xGxRMYMM,780240,782720,in um over here on the seats you can see
CG6xGxRMYMM,782720,784399,they don't recline anymore they just
CG6xGxRMYMM,784399,785760,kind of have a really far recline and
CG6xGxRMYMM,785760,787360,then i was surprised to see that this
CG6xGxRMYMM,787360,789519,ex-l trim doesn't have a fold-down
CG6xGxRMYMM,789519,790639,armrest that would have been nice in
CG6xGxRMYMM,790639,792560,terms of cupholder space
CG6xGxRMYMM,792560,793519,there is
CG6xGxRMYMM,793519,795600,one bottle holder here on the door
CG6xGxRMYMM,795600,796720,and then there's a little bit of storage
CG6xGxRMYMM,796720,798480,over here but it would be nice to see if
CG6xGxRMYMM,798480,800320,honda would add just a rear center
CG6xGxRMYMM,800320,801839,armrest here to give you a little bit
CG6xGxRMYMM,801839,803120,more comfort if you only have two people
CG6xGxRMYMM,803120,804959,in the back seat
CG6xGxRMYMM,804959,806880,now because the new hrv is built off of
CG6xGxRMYMM,806880,808560,the civics platform underneath the hood
CG6xGxRMYMM,808560,810959,we find a new engine the 1.8 liter four
CG6xGxRMYMM,810959,812320,cylinder is gone from the previous
CG6xGxRMYMM,812320,814079,generation it's been replaced by the
CG6xGxRMYMM,814079,816240,2-liter naturally aspirated k-series
CG6xGxRMYMM,816240,818320,motor that we also find in the current
CG6xGxRMYMM,818320,821440,generation civic it makes 158 horsepower
CG6xGxRMYMM,821440,823760,138 pound-feet of torque this engine has
CG6xGxRMYMM,823760,826079,ivtec it's a double overhead cam engine
CG6xGxRMYMM,826079,828800,it is about 11 horsepower stronger uh
CG6xGxRMYMM,828800,830720,versus or i'm sorry 17 horsepower more
CG6xGxRMYMM,830720,832399,versus the previous generation around 11
CG6xGxRMYMM,832399,833760,more pound-feet of torque now i am
CG6xGxRMYMM,833760,836320,surprised to not see the 1.5 liter turbo
CG6xGxRMYMM,836320,837600,under the hood but maybe honda will be
CG6xGxRMYMM,837600,839440,saving that for a later edition in other
CG6xGxRMYMM,839440,841360,markets the company does offer this as a
CG6xGxRMYMM,841360,843519,hybrid especially for the uk market but
CG6xGxRMYMM,843519,845680,again right now in the us we are we are
CG6xGxRMYMM,845680,847760,only get this one 2 liter gas powertrain
CG6xGxRMYMM,847760,849440,it all goes out through a continuously
CG6xGxRMYMM,849440,850800,variable transmission there was a time
CG6xGxRMYMM,850800,852240,where honda used to offer a manual in
CG6xGxRMYMM,852240,854160,the hrv but it just doesn't sell they
CG6xGxRMYMM,854160,856560,stopped offering that back in 2019 and
CG6xGxRMYMM,856560,857760,you can also take your pick between
CG6xGxRMYMM,857760,859279,their front wheel drive or all-wheel
CG6xGxRMYMM,859279,860800,drive with intelligent control it's
CG6xGxRMYMM,860800,862240,their newest all-wheel drive system
CG6xGxRMYMM,862240,863680,honda actually already has fuel economy
CG6xGxRMYMM,863680,864959,figures already for the front wheel
CG6xGxRMYMM,864959,866880,drive model it's rated at 26 in the city
CG6xGxRMYMM,866880,868480,and 32 on the highway that's on regular
CG6xGxRMYMM,868480,870079,gas this all-wheel drive version is
CG6xGxRMYMM,870079,872399,slightly lower at 25 in the city and 30
CG6xGxRMYMM,872399,873519,on the highway we don't know what the
CG6xGxRMYMM,873519,875120,zero 60 performance is yet we also don't
CG6xGxRMYMM,875120,876560,know the curb weight or whether this
CG6xGxRMYMM,876560,878320,vehicle will tell or not but we will be
CG6xGxRMYMM,878320,879920,driving this car in a couple weeks so be
CG6xGxRMYMM,879920,881519,sure to stay tuned for our video that
CG6xGxRMYMM,881519,883680,has the full on driving impressions so
CG6xGxRMYMM,883680,885519,because the new hrv is built off of a
CG6xGxRMYMM,885519,887519,global platform that also underpins the
CG6xGxRMYMM,887519,889839,civic this vehicle is significantly more
CG6xGxRMYMM,889839,891600,upscale for the u.s market it's more
CG6xGxRMYMM,891600,893519,powerful it's more spacious it's more
CG6xGxRMYMM,893519,895760,stylish and it's more tech heavy
CG6xGxRMYMM,895760,897120,especially when you look at the safety
CG6xGxRMYMM,897120,899279,tech honda's sensing driver assistance
CG6xGxRMYMM,899279,900880,is now standard on every trim and it
CG6xGxRMYMM,900880,902240,adds new features like traffic jam
CG6xGxRMYMM,902240,903600,assistant and i've also forgot to
CG6xGxRMYMM,903600,905120,mention because this is now on a new
CG6xGxRMYMM,905120,906720,platform it also has an independent rear
CG6xGxRMYMM,906720,908480,suspension which should significantly
CG6xGxRMYMM,908480,910639,improve the ride and handling of this
CG6xGxRMYMM,910639,912320,vehicle now in terms of the exterior
CG6xGxRMYMM,912320,914000,styling i wasn't so sure about the way
CG6xGxRMYMM,914000,915760,it looked in the photos however after
CG6xGxRMYMM,915760,917760,seeing it in person particularly in the
CG6xGxRMYMM,917760,919279,sport trim with the black wheels i think
CG6xGxRMYMM,919279,921680,the new hrv is really upscale looking i
CG6xGxRMYMM,921680,923040,really like the lines of this vehicle
CG6xGxRMYMM,923040,924480,it's introducing kind of a new design
CG6xGxRMYMM,924480,926240,language for honda and from certain
CG6xGxRMYMM,926240,927839,angles especially at the rear we see
CG6xGxRMYMM,927839,929839,some acura influence in the design it
CG6xGxRMYMM,929839,932079,almost looks like a baby acura suv which
CG6xGxRMYMM,932079,933519,is probably what honda was going for
CG6xGxRMYMM,933519,935279,especially with the overall length of
CG6xGxRMYMM,935279,936720,this car it's significantly larger and
CG6xGxRMYMM,936720,938160,as you guys saw it gives you way more
CG6xGxRMYMM,938160,940079,space on the inside now if you guys are
CG6xGxRMYMM,940079,942000,looking to purchase the new hrv it will
CG6xGxRMYMM,942000,944079,be going on sale in june so basically in
CG6xGxRMYMM,944079,946480,a month uh this is going to basically be
CG6xGxRMYMM,946480,947680,a little bit more expensive versus the
CG6xGxRMYMM,947680,948880,previous generation i expected that
CG6xGxRMYMM,948880,950240,because of all the new tech this car
CG6xGxRMYMM,950240,953600,starts at 23 650 for the base lx at
CG6xGxRMYMM,953600,955920,about 1400 if you guys want all-wheel
CG6xGxRMYMM,955920,958160,drive that's about 2 000 more versus the
CG6xGxRMYMM,958160,959759,previous generation which sounds fair
CG6xGxRMYMM,959759,961519,because of all the new tech and the
CG6xGxRMYMM,961519,963440,extra power that this car comes equipped
CG6xGxRMYMM,963440,964800,with that sport model over there is
CG6xGxRMYMM,964800,967040,about two grand more versus the lx at 25
CG6xGxRMYMM,967040,969839,650. this exl with all-wheel drive is
CG6xGxRMYMM,969839,972399,around 28 950 remember that pricing is
CG6xGxRMYMM,972399,974079,plus the 1200 destination charge so
CG6xGxRMYMM,974079,976079,you're looking at just over 30 grand for
CG6xGxRMYMM,976079,977680,this fully loaded model that is more
CG6xGxRMYMM,977680,979440,expensive than the old one however with
CG6xGxRMYMM,979440,981519,all the increased room efficiency tech
CG6xGxRMYMM,981519,983759,and premium touches it is still very
CG6xGxRMYMM,983759,985040,well priced and it's still a little bit
CG6xGxRMYMM,985040,986639,less expensive than most of the
CG6xGxRMYMM,986639,988000,competition but with all that said hope
CG6xGxRMYMM,988000,989920,you guys have enjoyed my very in-depth
