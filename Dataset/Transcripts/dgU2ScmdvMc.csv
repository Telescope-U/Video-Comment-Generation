dgU2ScmdvMc,373680,375600,in the spiritual city of varanasi
dgU2ScmdvMc,375600,377759,perhaps no endeavor carries more weight
dgU2ScmdvMc,377759,379520,than that of the proper and sacred
dgU2ScmdvMc,379520,381520,passage to the afterlife
dgU2ScmdvMc,381520,383360,evidence of this is seen routinely in
dgU2ScmdvMc,383360,385600,the city's narrow streets as i told you
dgU2ScmdvMc,385600,387680,this place is full of mysticism it's
dgU2ScmdvMc,387680,389759,full of religion faith worship a lot of
dgU2ScmdvMc,389759,391120,people come here for the last days of

dgU2ScmdvMc,392400,394319,just witnessed devout hindus believe
dgU2ScmdvMc,394319,396400,that if a deceased one's ashes are laid

dgU2ScmdvMc,398560,400639,cities their soul will be transported to
dgU2ScmdvMc,400639,404000,heaven and escape the cycle of rebirth

dgU2ScmdvMc,431120,432479,hundred years old that is what's so
dgU2ScmdvMc,432479,434080,interesting about varanasi as you walk

dgU2ScmdvMc,436160,438319,base is ready he portions it into clay
dgU2ScmdvMc,438319,440319,cups you could just drink it like this

dgU2ScmdvMc,469520,471120,little tart and a little just slightly
dgU2ScmdvMc,471120,472879,sour you can kind of have eaten and then
dgU2ScmdvMc,472879,474639,half drink it
dgU2ScmdvMc,474639,476160,this is like stomach therapy that
dgU2ScmdvMc,476160,478319,breakfast we had it was heavy and it was
dgU2ScmdvMc,478319,480000,heartburn inducing but this is what's
dgU2ScmdvMc,480000,481199,gonna bring you back to life this is
dgU2ScmdvMc,481199,482800,kind of the deluxe version it's got a
dgU2ScmdvMc,482800,484000,little bit of everything but here you

dgU2ScmdvMc,500160,501919,pictures of people looking stern a
dgU2ScmdvMc,501919,503520,little scared that is different from

dgU2ScmdvMc,630240,632240,over sweet minty and then you have the
dgU2ScmdvMc,632240,633920,leaf itself which is a little bitter and
dgU2ScmdvMc,633920,635600,mintier too like what quality eat a

dgU2ScmdvMc,641760,643440,experience here on the street to
dgU2ScmdvMc,643440,646110,varanasi very nice
dgU2ScmdvMc,646110,648720,[Music]
dgU2ScmdvMc,648720,650399,we've come to our next location right
dgU2ScmdvMc,650399,653519,here we have pati
dgU2ScmdvMc,655600,657360,nailed it our next street food is cooked
dgU2ScmdvMc,657360,659600,in flaming cow dog
dgU2ScmdvMc,659600,661440,but you'd never expect it from how it
dgU2ScmdvMc,661440,664399,looks let's back up
dgU2ScmdvMc,664399,666160,first a wheat dough is stuffed with a
dgU2ScmdvMc,666160,668079,filling made from chickpea powder raw
dgU2ScmdvMc,668079,670640,mustard oil harem seeds red pepper corn
dgU2ScmdvMc,670640,672720,and red chili pickle shape that into a
dgU2ScmdvMc,672720,674720,ball
dgU2ScmdvMc,674720,676720,as the dough balls pile up they light up
dgU2ScmdvMc,676720,680399,a pile of dry cow dunk
dgU2ScmdvMc,681360,683600,the use of dry cow dung as a fuel for
dgU2ScmdvMc,683600,685519,fire goes back thousands of years
dgU2ScmdvMc,685519,687360,they're dry and extremely flammable
dgU2ScmdvMc,687360,689120,turns out if you want you can cook on
dgU2ScmdvMc,689120,690800,those dung patties too as you know in
dgU2ScmdvMc,690800,692800,india cows are revered so technically
dgU2ScmdvMc,692800,694399,this is holy
dgU2ScmdvMc,694399,695519,i probably have to take that out of the
dgU2ScmdvMc,695519,697440,video cow manure is remarkable for many
dgU2ScmdvMc,697440,699040,reasons you put it in the soil it helps
dgU2ScmdvMc,699040,700720,the vegetables and plants to grow big
dgU2ScmdvMc,700720,702880,and strong but when it dries out it is
dgU2ScmdvMc,702880,704959,an excellent combustible material now i
dgU2ScmdvMc,704959,706480,know what you're thinking but it's cow
dgU2ScmdvMc,706480,708959,dung isn't that bad or what unhygienic
dgU2ScmdvMc,708959,710639,the fact is it's a million degrees
dgU2ScmdvMc,710639,712480,beyond that all the cow dung is made out
dgU2ScmdvMc,712480,714480,of organic matter anyways they're eating
dgU2ScmdvMc,714480,716880,grass and watermelons grains so it's
dgU2ScmdvMc,716880,718480,basically like we're burning plants
dgU2ScmdvMc,718480,720399,anyways they just happen to pass through
dgU2ScmdvMc,720399,722160,a cow when the bread is ready dust off
dgU2ScmdvMc,722160,723920,the excess ash and they're ready for the
dgU2ScmdvMc,723920,726480,next step
dgU2ScmdvMc,726560,728480,to serve our vendor grabs a bowl and
dgU2ScmdvMc,728480,730959,adds choca or potato curry it's a mix of
dgU2ScmdvMc,730959,733519,veggies spices roasted eggplant tomato
dgU2ScmdvMc,733519,735360,and boiled potatoes add a bit of green
dgU2ScmdvMc,735360,737440,chutney on top and then the bread dipped
dgU2ScmdvMc,737440,740660,in ghee before serving
dgU2ScmdvMc,740660,742880,[Music]

dgU2ScmdvMc,763440,765040,sour in there what's interesting is you
dgU2ScmdvMc,765040,766480,know if i was in vietnam they would have
dgU2ScmdvMc,766480,768320,some herbs to balance out the meal here
dgU2ScmdvMc,768320,769920,our balance is just straight onion it's
dgU2ScmdvMc,769920,771600,like oh is that too spicy just eat raw
dgU2ScmdvMc,771600,774320,onion then right look so inside you can
dgU2ScmdvMc,774320,776079,see the filling it is that roasted
dgU2ScmdvMc,776079,778000,chickpea flour it's nutty it has a very
dgU2ScmdvMc,778000,779440,thick texture chutney is bringing
dgU2ScmdvMc,779440,782000,something hot something sour
dgU2ScmdvMc,782000,783680,in many countries you go to your average
dgU2ScmdvMc,783680,785440,meal is going to be either designated
dgU2ScmdvMc,785440,788079,spicy savory sweet but in india they're
dgU2ScmdvMc,788079,790000,not afraid to do all three this is food
dgU2ScmdvMc,790000,791200,that wakes you up at night as you
dgU2ScmdvMc,791200,792800,remember the flavor in your dreams and

dgU2ScmdvMc,797760,799360,overall delicious but man that is a
dgU2ScmdvMc,799360,801120,powerful food with a kick on these
dgU2ScmdvMc,801120,804240,streets i'm sweating from my arms
dgU2ScmdvMc,804240,806320,the hindu religion itself has several
dgU2ScmdvMc,806320,808079,sub-branches though some tenets of the
dgU2ScmdvMc,808079,809280,faith seem constant
dgU2ScmdvMc,809280,813120,[Music]
dgU2ScmdvMc,813120,815519,most devout hindus are vegetarian though
dgU2ScmdvMc,815519,817440,dairy consumption is still allowed and
dgU2ScmdvMc,817440,818780,enjoyed widely
dgU2ScmdvMc,818780,819990,[Applause]
dgU2ScmdvMc,819990,821519,[Music]
dgU2ScmdvMc,821519,823600,for those who follow the hindu faith the
dgU2ScmdvMc,823600,825839,cow is to be revered and it's seen as a
dgU2ScmdvMc,825839,827600,mother figure
dgU2ScmdvMc,827600,830079,the cow provides milk and gives life
dgU2ScmdvMc,830079,832399,this is also why it's not unusual to see
dgU2ScmdvMc,832399,834320,cows in the street even in major
dgU2ScmdvMc,834320,836240,metropolitan cities right now we are

dgU2ScmdvMc,851199,852639,actually looks like a delicious wheat
dgU2ScmdvMc,852639,854399,flour dumpling but it's a kind of a
dgU2ScmdvMc,854399,856480,dessert dumpling here in another small
dgU2ScmdvMc,856480,858560,corner of varanasi the team from jai

dgU2ScmdvMc,877040,879120,crossing boundaries and borders and kind
dgU2ScmdvMc,879120,880880,of taking it to places i certainly
dgU2ScmdvMc,880880,882320,wouldn't expect when the filling is
dgU2ScmdvMc,882320,884000,thoroughly mixed it stuffed inside
dgU2ScmdvMc,884000,886000,rolled flower sheets and contorted into
dgU2ScmdvMc,886000,888959,their signature shape

dgU2ScmdvMc,894880,898399,turn a heavenly crispy golden brown
dgU2ScmdvMc,898399,900160,in a separate pot filled with sugar
dgU2ScmdvMc,900160,902560,syrup milk is added to remove impurities
dgU2ScmdvMc,902560,904560,of previously cooked food particles

dgU2ScmdvMc,919600,921199,through here and i'm hoping that it
dgU2ScmdvMc,921199,922800,comes back to say hello i'm not sure if
dgU2ScmdvMc,922800,924399,this is part of the cow's natural diet
dgU2ScmdvMc,924399,926959,but it could be so this is still hot and
dgU2ScmdvMc,926959,928959,just dripping with decadence i'm just
dgU2ScmdvMc,928959,930240,going to take a big bite and see what

dgU2ScmdvMc,958880,961360,fields of roses and he poured that into

dgU2ScmdvMc,1004320,1006160,entrance to the river where people go
dgU2ScmdvMc,1006160,1008160,and take a dip and worship all the way
dgU2ScmdvMc,1008160,1010320,through these narrow pathways and alleys
dgU2ScmdvMc,1010320,1012560,full of ancient history and foods and
