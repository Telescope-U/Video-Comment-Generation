EDyrfRDj1Wo,1200,6399,"Hinted at in 2021, it has  now come to pass in 2022:  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,6960,10720,EA Sports and FIFA have consciously uncoupled.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,11680,16080,"On the surface, the divorce is amicable.  There will be one more game together  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,16080,20880,(FIFA 23) and then the two parties  will go their separate ways.  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,20880,29840,"EA Sports will keep the game, FIFA will  keep the name. But what happens next?"
EDyrfRDj1Wo,31920,39040,"EA Sports moved first, announcing the start of the  ‘EA Sports FC’ brand, under which its future games  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,39040,43760,will be released. It was also quick to address  the question that immediately popped into the  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,43760,49039,mind of every worried gamer: Will it still  be able to use real club and player names? 
EDyrfRDj1Wo,49760,55359,CEO Andrew Wilson’s carefully-written press  release makes mention of EA Sports’ many  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,55360,61440,"“partners” in the first, second and fifth of  its five paragraphs, before pointedly quoting  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,61440,66240,those aforementioned partners named below as  they lined up to swear fealty to the brand.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,66960,72960,"One by one, the Premier League, La Liga in Spain,  Germany’s Bundesliga, Europe’s UEFA and South  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,72960,80240,America’s federation CONMEBOL pledged allegiance  to EA Sports FC. Message received and understood. 
EDyrfRDj1Wo,80800,84640,"Two hours later, FIFA responded,  rather less convincingly."
EDyrfRDj1Wo,85280,90400,"World football’s governing body announced  it had “diversified” its gaming rights,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,90400,95600,that it had new “non-simulation” games  planned for the crucial pre-World Cup  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,95600,100560,"finals third quarter of this year and  that it was “engaging with publishers,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,100560,106320,studios and investors on the development of a  major new simulation football title for 2024”.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,106960,112720,"“I can assure you,” FIFA president Gianni  Infantino said, “that the only authentic,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,112720,118240,real game that has the FIFA name will be the  best one available for gamers and football fans.  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,118240,127119,"The FIFA name is the only global, original  title. FIFA 23, FIFA 24, FIFA 25 and FIFA 26  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,127120,134160,and so on — the constant is the FIFA name and  it will remain forever and remain THE BEST.” 
EDyrfRDj1Wo,135280,139120,Rarely have so few words  offered so very much to unpack.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,140000,144960,"Let’s start with the “non-simulation games”.  And please note it’s “games”, plural. "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,144960,150800,FIFA said it was “launching a portfolio  of new games during 2022 and 2023”.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,151520,157520,"The phrase “non-simulation” suggests these won’t  be either ‘Be the footballer’ games, nor will they  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,157520,162400,take the form of ‘Be the football manager’ games.  But what else can you do under the FIFA banner? 
EDyrfRDj1Wo,162400,167040,Infantino’s belief that the mere ownership  of the word ‘FIFA’ is a guarantee of success  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,167040,170799,in an ever more sophisticated  gaming industry is startling.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,171360,176800,"This is either empty bombast to placate worried  stakeholders or he genuinely believes it,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,176800,182160,which is terrifying on several levels. If  he was president of Ferrari and all the  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,182160,186080,"staff left and all the factories burned  down and all the blueprints were lost,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,186080,190000,would he also believe that Ferrari would  remain forever and remain the best?
EDyrfRDj1Wo,190720,195360,It is unlikely that Infantino knows there  is a precedent for this sort of split.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,196160,201120,"Someone probably should have told him how  publisher Eidos broke up with Sports Interactive,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,201120,206879,"the development company behind the Championship  Manager series in 2003. Eidos kept the name,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,206880,211760,Sports Interactive kept the database and  match engine — the key components to the game.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,211760,215680,It was not an amicable split and  resentment simmers to this day.  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,216320,221360,"This was in a time before Facebook and Twitter,  and the break-up went unnoticed by many players."
EDyrfRDj1Wo,222000,227040,Both parties released their own games and Eidos  had the clear advantage of brand recognition. But  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,227680,231760,their Championship Manager 5 was so  riddled with bugs that it was nearly  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,231760,238239,unplayable on release. Sports Interactive’s  Football Manager 2005 was markedly superior. 
EDyrfRDj1Wo,238880,243360,"Even without social media, it didn’t take long for  players to learn which game was worth their money."
EDyrfRDj1Wo,244240,249920,"It took Football Manager years of steady,  organic growth, but they are now the lone  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,249920,254319,"superpower of the genre, while Championship  Manager has ceased production entirely.  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,254880,259519,"Eidos’ only advantage in that battle,  the fact many customers were entirely  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,259519,261786,"unaware that this was not the game they loved,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,261786,267360,is denied to FIFA now by the sheer weight  of online coverage in the past 48 hours.  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,267360,274800,And so we come to the exciting bit: The release of  “a major new simulation football title for 2024”.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,275840,281840,Let us be clear that competition is good.  EA Sports’ polished and popular series could  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,281840,286800,certainly do with it. Its relentless  focus on in-game purchases has raised  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,286800,290960,concerns and some gamers feel  it doesn’t always offer serious  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,290960,296479,progress from one edition to another. But competition in this market is hard.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,297120,302080,Japanese entertainment company Konami discovered  that last year with the troubled release of its  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,302080,305919,"‘eFootball’ game, the much-hyped next generation  of the Pro-Evolution Soccer (PES) series."
EDyrfRDj1Wo,306480,310080,"Konami has been in the  video-games business since 1978,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,310080,316080,the PES series began in 2001 and sold over 100  million units in its various incarnations. Its  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,317040,322480,‘eFootball’ was a well-meant attempt to counter  EA Sports’ dominance with a free-to-play game.  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,322480,326880,"Konami had the resources, the  expertise and the experience,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,326880,332480,and still its new game was pilloried on release. What is FIFA bringing to the party that Konami  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,332480,336080,did not? Aside from the apparently  magical power of its name?
EDyrfRDj1Wo,337120,343440,"FIFA’s best option would be to partner with an  established publisher — someone like 2K, which  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,343440,349360,produces the well-received NBA and PGA Tour games.  But even a company of that calibre would struggle  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,349360,355280,"to build substantial coding, data and quality  assurance teams in time for a 2024 release. "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,355280,360160,"While the story behind this break-up is yet to  fully emerge, it is widely thought to be caused  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,360160,366880,by a dispute over how to divide up revenue. EA  is believed to be making a third of its $5.6  
EDyrfRDj1Wo,366880,372720,"billion annual revenues from this game alone,  and FIFA apparently wanted a much bigger slice. "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,373520,379440,"When EA hinted at a parting of the ways last  October, a compromised was assumed on the basis  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,379440,384480,that FIFA would have to be crazy to shut off what  was essentially a pipeline delivering free money. 
EDyrfRDj1Wo,385200,387760,But that’s exactly what it has now done.
EDyrfRDj1Wo,388960,394479,FIFA’s only leverage was the threat of making  its own game and EA have called that bluff. 
EDyrfRDj1Wo,395120,401199,"Given the cost, both in resources and time,  of building an entirely new gaming franchise,  "
EDyrfRDj1Wo,401200,404800,this may prove to be an  extremely expensive error.
