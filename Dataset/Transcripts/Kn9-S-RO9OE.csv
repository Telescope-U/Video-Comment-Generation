Kn9-S-RO9OE,0,3419,[Music]
Kn9-S-RO9OE,7680,10800,the existentialists called it throneness
Kn9-S-RO9OE,10800,14160,which is not that's a high dagarian term
Kn9-S-RO9OE,14160,16480,and throneness is the fact that
Kn9-S-RO9OE,16480,18960,we kind of experience life as if we're
Kn9-S-RO9OE,18960,20960,tossed into it thrown into it you know
Kn9-S-RO9OE,20960,23760,you're you're male and not female you're
Kn9-S-RO9OE,23760,26320,you're hindu and not christian
Kn9-S-RO9OE,26320,29119,you're tall and not short you have an
Kn9-S-RO9OE,29119,31679,arbitrary range of talents and arbitrary
Kn9-S-RO9OE,31679,34239,range of limitations none of which in
Kn9-S-RO9OE,34239,36559,some sense you chose
Kn9-S-RO9OE,36559,38480,it's the cards you're dealt
Kn9-S-RO9OE,38480,41280,now some of those are cards of privilege
Kn9-S-RO9OE,41280,43120,now maybe you're born intelligent maybe
Kn9-S-RO9OE,43120,45039,you're born symmetrical maybe you're
Kn9-S-RO9OE,45039,47280,born healthy
Kn9-S-RO9OE,47280,49520,maybe you're born into a culture where
Kn9-S-RO9OE,49520,52079,it's much easier not to be absolutely
Kn9-S-RO9OE,52079,54879,deprived maybe your parents are rich
Kn9-S-RO9OE,54879,56559,and so
Kn9-S-RO9OE,56559,59120,all of that in some sense is unearned
Kn9-S-RO9OE,59120,61840,now along with that comes
Kn9-S-RO9OE,61840,64400,a good dose of existential guilt
Kn9-S-RO9OE,64400,66080,because at the same time and this is
Kn9-S-RO9OE,66080,68320,true for anyone
Kn9-S-RO9OE,68320,70640,regardless of their cultural background
Kn9-S-RO9OE,70640,71439,the
Kn9-S-RO9OE,71439,74720,ground we walk on is soaked in the blood
Kn9-S-RO9OE,74720,77280,of historical atrocity
Kn9-S-RO9OE,77280,79759,and so that's on you
Kn9-S-RO9OE,79759,80640,because
Kn9-S-RO9OE,80640,82960,you know people think well who's the
Kn9-S-RO9OE,82960,85680,nazi well it's the fascist or it's the
Kn9-S-RO9OE,85680,89119,or who's the radical communist it's the
Kn9-S-RO9OE,89119,91439,radical left-wing ideologue and the
Kn9-S-RO9OE,91439,93200,fundamental truth of the matter is
Kn9-S-RO9OE,93200,95840,that's best dealt with as a spiritual
Kn9-S-RO9OE,95840,97520,matter is
Kn9-S-RO9OE,97520,100400,the adversary is within
Kn9-S-RO9OE,100400,101680,really
Kn9-S-RO9OE,101680,104159,most profoundly and so you have to take
Kn9-S-RO9OE,104159,106159,the responsibility for that historical
Kn9-S-RO9OE,106159,108640,atrocity onto yourself i was talking to
Kn9-S-RO9OE,108640,110799,guy ritchie this week about his movie
Kn9-S-RO9OE,110799,112560,king arthur it's quite an interesting
Kn9-S-RO9OE,112560,115600,movie in many ways and when arthur who
Kn9-S-RO9OE,115600,116960,could be the hero
Kn9-S-RO9OE,116960,118479,takes the sword
Kn9-S-RO9OE,118479,120799,he's so overcome by visions of his
Kn9-S-RO9OE,120799,122640,murderous uncle that he can't pick up
Kn9-S-RO9OE,122640,123840,the weapon
Kn9-S-RO9OE,123840,124799,well
Kn9-S-RO9OE,124799,127280,think about that now you have weapons at
Kn9-S-RO9OE,127280,129440,your disposal
Kn9-S-RO9OE,129440,131760,but they've been used by your murderous
Kn9-S-RO9OE,131760,132959,uncle
Kn9-S-RO9OE,132959,135680,how dare you wield them
Kn9-S-RO9OE,135680,137680,and the answer is
Kn9-S-RO9OE,137680,139440,maybe it's easy just to leave the sword
Kn9-S-RO9OE,139440,140959,on the ground because
Kn9-S-RO9OE,140959,142640,you do want to be responsible for
Kn9-S-RO9OE,142640,144720,atrocities going forward and don't think
Kn9-S-RO9OE,144720,146319,you couldn't be and don't think you
Kn9-S-RO9OE,146319,148720,might not enjoy it
Kn9-S-RO9OE,148720,150879,and so
Kn9-S-RO9OE,150879,152640,the way you pay for your privilege is
Kn9-S-RO9OE,152640,154319,with your virtue
Kn9-S-RO9OE,154319,156800,i mean that most particularly you have
Kn9-S-RO9OE,156800,159840,these opportunities and this existential
Kn9-S-RO9OE,159840,162400,guilt and the way you expiate that and
Kn9-S-RO9OE,162400,165840,atone is by doing your best to live the
Kn9-S-RO9OE,165840,168000,best possible life you can manage to
Kn9-S-RO9OE,168000,170400,speak the truth to treat people with
Kn9-S-RO9OE,170400,173360,respect to abide by the principles of
Kn9-S-RO9OE,173360,175120,the dignity of the individual and to put
Kn9-S-RO9OE,175120,176720,your house in order
Kn9-S-RO9OE,176720,178400,and that's how you pay for your unearned
Kn9-S-RO9OE,178400,180959,privilege all of us
Kn9-S-RO9OE,180959,183840,and we all have our privileges and our
Kn9-S-RO9OE,183840,186239,and our curses you know all of us have
Kn9-S-RO9OE,186239,187920,that that's why it's not useful to be
Kn9-S-RO9OE,187920,189519,envious of people
Kn9-S-RO9OE,189519,191519,you know you see some you're a young man
Kn9-S-RO9OE,191519,193280,you see someone drive by in a ferrari
Kn9-S-RO9OE,193280,196000,with a blonde and you think my god he's
Kn9-S-RO9OE,196000,198239,got everything and you know the woman in
Kn9-S-RO9OE,198239,200000,the car is a prostitute who's got a
Kn9-S-RO9OE,200000,202800,cocaine addiction and her her life is
Kn9-S-RO9OE,202800,205120,just one catastrophe after another and
Kn9-S-RO9OE,205120,207200,he's had to lie and cheat his way into
Kn9-S-RO9OE,207200,209360,this position and he's afraid that
Kn9-S-RO9OE,209360,210959,everything's going to come crashing down
Kn9-S-RO9OE,210959,213840,on him and that's what you're jealous of
Kn9-S-RO9OE,213840,216959,and it's just not that
Kn9-S-RO9OE,216959,218319,profound
Kn9-S-RO9OE,218319,220560,you don't want someone else's fate man
Kn9-S-RO9OE,220560,222959,your fate's enough and your adventure is
Kn9-S-RO9OE,222959,225200,enough it's plenty it's more than you
Kn9-S-RO9OE,225200,227200,can ever fully realize
Kn9-S-RO9OE,227200,228959,and so that's also part of the reason
Kn9-S-RO9OE,228959,230720,that we all believe that the individual
Kn9-S-RO9OE,230720,233040,has some intrinsic dignity it's don't be
Kn9-S-RO9OE,233040,235120,so sure that your position and your room
Kn9-S-RO9OE,235120,237120,is so damn trivial might be your
Kn9-S-RO9OE,237120,239360,attitude towards it that's trivial and
Kn9-S-RO9OE,239360,241519,if you're in dire straits and dire
Kn9-S-RO9OE,241519,242879,circumstances
Kn9-S-RO9OE,242879,244720,just look at how much opportunity you
Kn9-S-RO9OE,244720,247060,have to make things better
Kn9-S-RO9OE,247060,250480,[Music]
Kn9-S-RO9OE,250480,252799,we're built to walk uphill
Kn9-S-RO9OE,252799,253519,and
Kn9-S-RO9OE,253519,254799,when you
Kn9-S-RO9OE,254799,256479,reach the pinnacle of the hill you want
Kn9-S-RO9OE,256479,258880,to stop and appreciate the vision but
Kn9-S-RO9OE,258880,260799,the next thing you want is a higher hill
Kn9-S-RO9OE,260799,262560,in the distance because
Kn9-S-RO9OE,262560,265440,it's the uphill climb that it's it's
Kn9-S-RO9OE,265440,267520,from the uphill climb that we derive our
Kn9-S-RO9OE,267520,269840,value and i mean this technically so
Kn9-S-RO9OE,269840,272240,almost all the positive emotion we feel
Kn9-S-RO9OE,272240,274560,especially the the
Kn9-S-RO9OE,274560,276080,the emotion that fills us with
Kn9-S-RO9OE,276080,277919,enthusiasm and that's to be filled with
Kn9-S-RO9OE,277919,279520,the spirit of god by the way because
Kn9-S-RO9OE,279520,281600,that's what enthusiasm means
Kn9-S-RO9OE,281600,283360,that's
Kn9-S-RO9OE,283360,286000,experienced in relationship to a goal
Kn9-S-RO9OE,286000,288000,and so in some sense and this is part of
Kn9-S-RO9OE,288000,290080,the religious enterprise you want a goal
Kn9-S-RO9OE,290080,292320,that you can never attain
Kn9-S-RO9OE,292320,294479,right so you can always move closer to
Kn9-S-RO9OE,294479,296479,the goal that recedes as you move
Kn9-S-RO9OE,296479,297600,towards it you think well that's
Kn9-S-RO9OE,297600,299280,frustrating it's like sisyphus pushing
Kn9-S-RO9OE,299280,302560,the rock uphill but it's not because as
Kn9-S-RO9OE,302560,305280,you pursue that goal you put yourself
Kn9-S-RO9OE,305280,307199,together and your life does get better
Kn9-S-RO9OE,307199,309680,and richer and more abundant that's why
Kn9-S-RO9OE,309680,312320,the highest levels of virtue and goal
Kn9-S-RO9OE,312320,314400,are in some sense transcendent
Kn9-S-RO9OE,314400,316560,you want them to be above everything
Kn9-S-RO9OE,316560,318639,you're doing so you can continually move
Kn9-S-RO9OE,318639,320479,towards something that's more sublime
Kn9-S-RO9OE,320479,322800,and better that's what you are you're
Kn9-S-RO9OE,322800,324800,here to live not to
Kn9-S-RO9OE,324800,326240,not to sleep
Kn9-S-RO9OE,326240,328560,and the problem with the vision of my
Kn9-S-RO9OE,328560,330639,ties on the beach is that well first of
Kn9-S-RO9OE,330639,332320,all that's an envision that's a vision
Kn9-S-RO9OE,332320,334320,of of drug-induced
Kn9-S-RO9OE,334320,336400,unconsciousness second it's only going
Kn9-S-RO9OE,336400,338240,to work for about a week third you're
Kn9-S-RO9OE,338240,340160,going to be a laughingstock in a month
Kn9-S-RO9OE,340160,342320,and depressed and aimless
Kn9-S-RO9OE,342320,345600,and and goalless it's no that's not it's
Kn9-S-RO9OE,345600,347360,it's you want a horizon of ever
Kn9-S-RO9OE,347360,350000,expanding possibility and so it does
Kn9-S-RO9OE,350000,351759,happen to people as they because they've
Kn9-S-RO9OE,351759,353840,staked their soul
Kn9-S-RO9OE,353840,355680,on the attainment of an instrumental
Kn9-S-RO9OE,355680,357919,goal and it can be a pretty high order
Kn9-S-RO9OE,357919,360000,goal it was in your case but then you
Kn9-S-RO9OE,360000,360880,think
Kn9-S-RO9OE,360880,364080,well i've now i'm there now what
Kn9-S-RO9OE,364080,366720,well the answer can't be well i'm going
Kn9-S-RO9OE,366720,368240,to live in the lap of luxury and never
Kn9-S-RO9OE,368240,369440,have to leave the fa what do you want to
Kn9-S-RO9OE,369440,372160,be a giant infant with a gold with a
Kn9-S-RO9OE,372160,373759,gold bottle you never have to do
Kn9-S-RO9OE,373759,375600,anything but lay in your back and suck
Kn9-S-RO9OE,375600,376800,it's like
Kn9-S-RO9OE,376800,378960,well you see the problem with that as a
Kn9-S-RO9OE,378960,382479,as a as a conceptualization it's no you
Kn9-S-RO9OE,382479,384000,want to be
Kn9-S-RO9OE,384000,386560,like an active warrior moving up hill
Kn9-S-RO9OE,386560,388720,with your sword in hand and
Kn9-S-RO9OE,388720,391280,that's that's dynamic that's exciting
Kn9-S-RO9OE,391280,393280,that's why so many young men disappear
Kn9-S-RO9OE,393280,395919,into video games it's that's all acted
Kn9-S-RO9OE,395919,397680,out in the video game
Kn9-S-RO9OE,397680,399280,so they have to act that out in their
Kn9-S-RO9OE,399280,401199,own life
Kn9-S-RO9OE,401199,402479,we asked that question with good
Kn9-S-RO9OE,402479,405280,intentions are you happy what's a better
Kn9-S-RO9OE,405280,407840,question for me to ask jordan peterson
Kn9-S-RO9OE,407840,410800,how are you doing how are you doing
Kn9-S-RO9OE,410800,413440,how are you doing
Kn9-S-RO9OE,414560,416000,brilliantly and terribly
Kn9-S-RO9OE,416000,417680,[Music]
Kn9-S-RO9OE,417680,419360,you know when you listen to a profound
Kn9-S-RO9OE,419360,422680,piece of music
Kn9-S-RO9OE,422880,425440,one that sort of spans the whole
Kn9-S-RO9OE,425440,427680,emotional experience
Kn9-S-RO9OE,427680,429360,it's not happy
Kn9-S-RO9OE,429360,432000,happy is elevator music and
Kn9-S-RO9OE,432000,433520,probably you just shouldn't listen to
Kn9-S-RO9OE,433520,435280,that at all
Kn9-S-RO9OE,435280,438240,right and and you think why well
Kn9-S-RO9OE,438240,440800,it's harmless it's tricky it's
Kn9-S-RO9OE,440800,441170,sweet
Kn9-S-RO9OE,441170,443199,[Music]
Kn9-S-RO9OE,443199,445199,simple it lacks depth it's shallow
Kn9-S-RO9OE,445199,446720,that's a problem
Kn9-S-RO9OE,446720,449720,um
Kn9-S-RO9OE,451199,454080,it doesn't have that deep sense of awe
Kn9-S-RO9OE,454080,456240,and horror i would say
Kn9-S-RO9OE,456240,458639,that is characteristic of the best of
Kn9-S-RO9OE,458639,461680,all music you know you listen to some
Kn9-S-RO9OE,461680,464479,simple music so-called hank williams is
Kn9-S-RO9OE,464479,466639,a good example you know the
Kn9-S-RO9OE,466639,468800,blues cowboy from the 50s who died of
Kn9-S-RO9OE,468800,471120,alcoholism when he was 27 and whose
Kn9-S-RO9OE,471120,474080,voice sounds like an 80 year old man
Kn9-S-RO9OE,474080,477680,simple melody no but
Kn9-S-RO9OE,477680,480000,there's nothing simple in the song
Kn9-S-RO9OE,480000,481919,and in the voice
Kn9-S-RO9OE,481919,484400,it's deep you know it's like the blues
Kn9-S-RO9OE,484400,486240,it's like black blues in the states from
Kn9-S-RO9OE,486240,487599,the 20s and this was certainly
Kn9-S-RO9OE,487599,490720,influenced by that tradition
Kn9-S-RO9OE,490720,492639,there's this
Kn9-S-RO9OE,492639,495120,mission of a deep suffering
Kn9-S-RO9OE,495120,497120,at the same time as
Kn9-S-RO9OE,497120,498960,you get the
Kn9-S-RO9OE,498960,500080,beautiful
Kn9-S-RO9OE,500080,503120,transcendence of the music
Kn9-S-RO9OE,503120,505199,and that's meaning you know
Kn9-S-RO9OE,505199,506319,that's
Kn9-S-RO9OE,506319,510960,awful in the most fundamental sense but
Kn9-S-RO9OE,510960,514240,you need an antidote to suffering and
Kn9-S-RO9OE,514240,516479,it has to be deep and no one deep moves
Kn9-S-RO9OE,516479,519120,you tectonically and it's not a trivial
Kn9-S-RO9OE,519120,521760,thing and but that's better than
Kn9-S-RO9OE,521760,523518,happiness
Kn9-S-RO9OE,523518,525120,and maybe if you're lucky well you're
Kn9-S-RO9OE,525120,526640,pursuing that and while you're immersed
Kn9-S-RO9OE,526640,528800,in it you get to be happy and and you
Kn9-S-RO9OE,528800,530560,should fall on your knees and be
Kn9-S-RO9OE,530560,532240,grateful for that when it happens you
Kn9-S-RO9OE,532240,535200,know it's a gift it really is a gift
Kn9-S-RO9OE,535200,537040,and it comes upon you unexpectedly your
Kn9-S-RO9OE,537040,538800,happiness you know
Kn9-S-RO9OE,538800,541040,but
Kn9-S-RO9OE,541040,543040,you aim to climb up hill to the highest
Kn9-S-RO9OE,543040,545519,peak you can possibly envision
Kn9-S-RO9OE,545519,546640,and that's
Kn9-S-RO9OE,546640,548020,that's better than happiness
Kn9-S-RO9OE,548020,552560,[Music]
Kn9-S-RO9OE,552560,555920,why did you include terribly
Kn9-S-RO9OE,556959,559600,well for example now when i go
Kn9-S-RO9OE,559600,561200,wherever i go in the world people come
Kn9-S-RO9OE,561200,564320,up to me and they're usually
Kn9-S-RO9OE,564320,567120,i wouldn't say they're happy to see me
Kn9-S-RO9OE,567120,569200,they're often in tears
Kn9-S-RO9OE,569200,570640,you know
Kn9-S-RO9OE,570640,573360,and they often have a pretty rough story
Kn9-S-RO9OE,573360,575279,to relate you know they were suicidal or
Kn9-S-RO9OE,575279,579040,nihilistic or homicidal or
Kn9-S-RO9OE,579040,580560,trapped
Kn9-S-RO9OE,580560,582399,desperate
Kn9-S-RO9OE,582399,585440,you know and they tell me that real fast
Kn9-S-RO9OE,585440,587680,and then they say i've overcome that to
Kn9-S-RO9OE,587680,590880,a large degree and thank you for that
Kn9-S-RO9OE,590880,592240,and you think well that's really
Kn9-S-RO9OE,592240,593680,something to
Kn9-S-RO9OE,593680,596000,have that happen over and over
Kn9-S-RO9OE,596000,597279,in some ways you might think well how
Kn9-S-RO9OE,597279,599279,could anything better possibly happen to
Kn9-S-RO9OE,599279,601279,you and have people come up to you all
Kn9-S-RO9OE,601279,602959,over the world strangers and open
Kn9-S-RO9OE,602959,604640,themselves up like that like they're old
Kn9-S-RO9OE,604640,607120,friends so quickly but
Kn9-S-RO9OE,607120,610720,at the same time it's an awful thing
Kn9-S-RO9OE,610720,612640,because you see
Kn9-S-RO9OE,612640,614959,even in the revelation of their triumph
Kn9-S-RO9OE,614959,618710,the initial depth of their despair
Kn9-S-RO9OE,618710,621839,[Music]
Kn9-S-RO9OE,622320,625040,so i wouldn't change that
Kn9-S-RO9OE,625040,627040,but it's not nothing
Kn9-S-RO9OE,627040,629920,it's certainly not just happiness
Kn9-S-RO9OE,629920,632000,it's better than happiness but it's
Kn9-S-RO9OE,632000,634850,almost unbearable
Kn9-S-RO9OE,634850,640980,[Music]
Kn9-S-RO9OE,644500,663709,[Music]
Kn9-S-RO9OE,666880,668959,you
