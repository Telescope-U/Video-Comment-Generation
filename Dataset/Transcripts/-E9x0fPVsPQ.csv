-E9x0fPVsPQ,188879,195519,30.  yeah okay 30 yeah that is [ __ ]  disgraceful and essentially
-E9x0fPVsPQ,195519,202560,essentially you only scored one [ __ ]  try because the felice one was forward  so you're like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,203760,208959,[ __ ] awful no it wasn't no it wasn't  look  you're getting a bit caught up in like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,208959,213040,game two there's still a game to go boys  no we know
-E9x0fPVsPQ,215599,221760,we're talking about what happened what  happened is  jerome lewis and uh
-E9x0fPVsPQ,221760,226959,like trying to tackle him embarrassing  nathan clearly did it twice in two  minutes yeah and then all pointing at
-E9x0fPVsPQ,226959,234400,each other you're prepared to like  acknowledge that your your side and  by extension your state just gave up and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,234400,239760,the going got tough they realized they  realized that clearly the ref and  everyone was against us they want to go
-E9x0fPVsPQ,239760,245680,to game three let's appease the masses  let's go to the games  on the companion what are you doing the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,245680,250720,penalty kicks in the game  penalty count and can i be honest let's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,250720,257280,go back to the felicity yeah let's go  back was there five or six repeats sets  to six in a row on the [ __ ] trial and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,257280,263199,fellaini  six four there was five there was two  and they're police literally not even
-E9x0fPVsPQ,263199,268560,doing anything just sitting on him i  wouldn't watch it again because the  replay he's on him for [ __ ]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,268560,273600,ages 10 seconds and the referee already  wouldn't get the [ __ ] off him it was  lazy and it was [ __ ] and that is a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,273600,280960,[ __ ] sin bin every day of the week so  forget all that rubbish refereeing  decision bias all that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,281040,286639,you kind of just flop [ __ ] someone  for 15 seconds to get away with it  because that's what your queenslanders  do you try to take the [ __ ] piss you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,286639,292320,weren't on side  at all for a second me he's one i am  pumped up very angry [ __ ] i think
-E9x0fPVsPQ,292320,298960,jesus no no i'm pumped up  here's the facts here's the facts game
-E9x0fPVsPQ,298960,304479,one the play the ball average speed was  three game two it was four clearly new  south wales line all over the right
-E9x0fPVsPQ,304479,310240,clearly new south wales coming up  okay so why was it slow in the first  game it was faster in the first game but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,310240,315840,like if you're implying that new south  wales started doing it you should double  it should be six seconds because you're  you're [ __ ]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,315840,322080,do you know what i mean that's a great  point you just wrapped him up there you  go i mean a pretzel there you raped him
-E9x0fPVsPQ,322080,327919,you got him six seconds it would be six  if we were doing what you were doing  yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,328479,333759,uh it's good look i mean we do want to  promote the game bring it back to  suncorp i mean look it's all about
-E9x0fPVsPQ,333759,340400,giving back to the queensland fans  that's what we're going to do queensland  towards the end of the game we're  sitting there going look we want to give  back to queensland fans let them have
-E9x0fPVsPQ,340400,345759,this one and we're going to go back to  queensland win get the job done game  over  it's just i think it's important for

-E9x0fPVsPQ,622320,628320,whipping you like it was real bdsm [ __ ]  yeah maybe we liked that you were gagged  after you clearly no we like to get gay
-E9x0fPVsPQ,628320,634720,do you like getting dominated  because then we like to flip the  position  and surprise you no no you try we allow
-E9x0fPVsPQ,634720,640399,a bit of role playing then i hope you  know i hope you know that in the fine  print was yeah okay bit of bdsm but we
-E9x0fPVsPQ,640399,646480,flipped you at the end and dominator  we allow you in the start of the bdsm  role-playing situation i think that

-E9x0fPVsPQ,685360,690720,look i think game three is going to be a  cracking game i actually i want to thank  queensland for allowing us to get this
-E9x0fPVsPQ,690720,696560,the pinnacle of rugby league which is a  game three to sign up so who was the  shooters player for queensland  no [ __ ] players well who was the

-E9x0fPVsPQ,732399,737680,say doggy's going better than he's lost  a coach that he signed the club with and  the team's being humped by everyone
-E9x0fPVsPQ,737680,744720,except for like the last two games and  he's and he's been getting used to a new  position like  dan gagai has been playing cena a lot

-E9x0fPVsPQ,1151360,1160080,yeah look i don't think anyone should be  shocked by that jake chabois is  new south wales he is the state he just
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1160080,1165360,gets it the moment he went onto the  field you were like oh this  motherfucker's ready to party he didn't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1165360,1170960,miss a tackle i think 36 tackles  something like that didn't miss a single  one made some crucial [ __ ] tackles
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1170960,1178320,played 71 minutes in the middle didn't  look tired just [ __ ] truck nut  and just crushed a beer after the game
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1178320,1184480,yeah because he knows what he's doing he  made such light work of that but i heard  whispers
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1184480,1189679,that he gave one of the great halftime  speeches of all time and i would pay big
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1189679,1196000,big big money to hear what he said put  it as your alarm every morning [ __ ] back  if you wouldn't bro what you want to get
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1196000,1202159,you're getting out of bed i'm sure  you're having a tough day you know the  world's against you you need some  motivation bang what's the alarm going
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1202159,1207440,off  game two origin speech that's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1207440,1214159,mate are you telling me that if he  released a motivational series other  david goggins but in a more traditional
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1214159,1219280,northern peninsula based manly rhetoric  sort of odd that you wouldn't buy that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1219280,1225840,how much we talking on the app store 99  cents dollar five charger  okay okay okay do you know what you're
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1225840,1231039,talking about mates he's not trying to  clip tickets like you [ __ ] he's just  happy to give it to the people he just
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1231039,1236799,wants everyone to have it man the people  yeah man of the people now do you think  it was as purely original this halftime
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1236799,1243840,speech or do you think he took best bits  from the best pinch like billy does mate  he's [ __ ] he's a ridgid
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1243840,1249600,yeah not a content student speaks from  the heart it would have been one from  one you know what i mean yeah okay from  the heart straight off he didn't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1249600,1255440,rehearse it at all or you reckon in the  mirror  he is just in the moment he's present i  think he looks around the room
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1255440,1261200,okay obviously teddy said some words  obviously freddie said some words and he  goes you know what
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1261200,1266480,oy freddy teddy steady i got this steady  on i got this and it's now it's now it's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1266480,1272960,time for an injection of jkt  bang all passion all passionate he would  have talked about family
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1272960,1280159,state he would have been he would have  been near on tears yeah yeah yeah pride  passion power families bleed blue you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1280159,1286240,would have said follow me boys i'll set  the [ __ ] temper yeah derek and he  threw it on i said the time  you know or not
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1286240,1292000,just a little baby one i don't think so  i don't think i think that maybe i think  he probably would have teed up someone
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1292000,1297360,to just have that like playing low  underneath him as he's talking then as  he's getting more [ __ ] jacked up the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1297360,1303280,volume comes up and then it just  finishes and everyone's just new south  wales  where the blues that's how i would have
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1303280,1309520,seen it yeah but again i wasn't in there  okay we weren't in there that's  surprising  you're like family
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1309520,1314799,look we had things on we had the stream  to do we had to do stuff for the partner  in the dribble that's what we do that's  commitment
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1314799,1320559,saying no to a new south wales locker  room time speech for the punter in the  dream you guys are generally but i like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1320559,1327039,if i had to guess  i would say i'm almost 100 certain that  he would have spoken about you know our
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1327039,1332960,families back on the east coast  of which we are so yeah insofacto he was
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1332960,1339200,so you're gonna even said like look what  tommy and you're doing right now yeah  [ __ ] doing a companion could have  been here they could have flown
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1339200,1344799,like they've got the company going in  front of millions of people like don't  let them down they were offered exit row
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1344799,1352320,seats over to perth you know and then  put up in a really  you know mid-range hotel room
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1352320,1358720,with with you or like nothing  shares a plus twin chairs free breakfast  though plush free breakfast or
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1358720,1363760,continental  and they turned it down to dribbling
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1363760,1371120,yarn for the pun in the dribble that's  sort of guys they are that's sort of  guys we've got to be he was looking at  all the boys eyes and they're going yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1371120,1377280,and then the rumor is as they ran out  they yelled at her yeah  and said tom and eddie turned down a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1377280,1384480,continental breakfast like to to support  this what are you preparing what are you  what are you giving up yeah they gave up
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1384480,1389679,wheat picks and milk baby orange juice  and some raisin toast to wash it all
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1389679,1395039,down  a bit of yogurt to mix inside your tummy  you know yogurt no joe doesn't go well
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1395039,1401440,but yeah i'll tell you what this is it's  all about sacrifice when it comes to  origin and  a lot of the time queenslanders aren't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1401440,1407520,prepared to sacrifice  clearly they can't go so you don't  reckon a couple of days early so you  boys don't reckon the queenslander would
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1407520,1413120,be willing to sacrifice a continental  breakfast to win an origin series that's  exactly what i'm saying jesus i tell you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1413120,1419520,what that those toasts the toast does  hit different when it goes through those  machines rather than the toasting thing  look at that are good yeah you could
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1419520,1425600,argue that a continental breakfast is  just a breakfast at home but it's not  it's oh it's not that way so much more
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1425600,1431120,so much you just you know you're showing  you don't get breakfast if that's your  [ __ ] attitude that's what i would say
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1431120,1437279,that's what i would say no one got more  excited about continental breakfast than  my dad nobody
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1437279,1442400,and you know what he'd have i thought  wait bix and miller oh [ __ ] do you know  what he used to have at home
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1442400,1448799,you guessed it  wheat dicks and milk but it didn't  matter it's got a bit of pizzazz about  it the continental river yeah it's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1448799,1454080,freezing and that's what mattered it is  interesting that they still roll with  and jam toast jam taste is good
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1454080,1460000,with a butter or no butter  butter come on mountains of it okay um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1460000,1465919,but it is interesting how they still use  those machines that make your toast go  through it  you know what i'm talking about it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1465919,1473120,tastes good i think they're i think  that's probably you know the optimum  machine for toasting bread
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1473120,1479520,that one where it's just it's rolling  through the conveyor belt it's also a  bit of fun because you're watching how  it is you're on the bread line you know
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1479520,1485200,i like to i like to sit back and get the  run the the lay of the land before i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1485200,1491840,step up to the machine because you've  got a bullet i like to see the machine  you'll see what it's spitting out i like  to see what it's spitting out because
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1491840,1498799,sometimes you'll see it'll spit it out  too early  and you'll go  can i can i go a second run here and get
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1498799,1504960,and get the optimal in which case i'll  leave it but if it's if it's coming out  slight like close but not close enough
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1504960,1510080,then you've got to [ __ ] timing your  shoe on your hands yeah it's going to be  very difficult how many people are using  the thing though right like if you've
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1510080,1515919,got a clear if you've got clear air then  you can you really do well it depends it  depends because obviously a breakfast
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1515919,1522720,period can run from anywhere from like 7  30 to 10 10 30 if you've got a very a  pretty lenient uh hotel maybe even 11 if
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1522720,1528720,you want to push them when they throw in  breakfast from like six to late you know  they're just trying to save money like i  get a free breakfast but it's at four in
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1528720,1533760,the morning yeah yeah you've got it yeah  if you're not up before you can't get it  yeah  i feel like most people go to breakfast
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1533760,1540559,around the same time if they're on  holidays it's about 9 30 10.  but as long as you've got the  opportunity you're done before then
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1540559,1546240,yeah well you're not on holiday well  you're having a fight with the missus  no no no or you have [ __ ] children
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1546240,1551279,who've been up since six and you're like  past time i got caught yeah okay what
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1551279,1557279,was through that how'd that happen well  bro so like the pound towns yeah yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1557279,1563039,and  ones or twos well the pound town ones  got me my first job pantone two
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1563039,1568720,seconds well you learned from the first  time of you know better ways to get  there and all that stuff people can  improve you can a shoe can always be
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1568720,1574240,improved and it was i'll tell you who  could have done with a couple of uh a  set of pound town ones
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1574240,1580880,or twos teddy teddy  yes teddy he needed grip he needed pound  town one thing he needed one's on bro he
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1580880,1586559,was bloody skidding everywhere every  ronnie would just go past the camera  angle yeah in that first half he fell
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1586559,1591840,over  what ten times well we we called for  better sprigs and we had the second half  i think they're listening because he
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1591840,1598559,didn't slip over again after we got  angry we got pantanas on that was that  was pound towns we called freddy and  said listen we just created
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1598559,1604559,breaks straight to [ __ ] up the  stadium get him to put these on  he dropped yep
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1604559,1610640,amazon  but anyway  so  so basically you don't like you don't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1610640,1615919,like my my thinking around the fact that  most people have  breakfast at the same time
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1615919,1621760,i'm just saying that as long as i like  it i like it i don't have kids i'm not  an auntie i'm saying if you've got kids  you're going earlier that's just the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1621760,1627039,reality why because you tell them to  sleep in yeah someone shut this [ __ ] up  seriously
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1627039,1632400,pull their heads in yeah  daddy yeah just trying to sleep just  tell them to go to bed yeah yeah yeah i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1632400,1638240,asked i don't understand why you don't  do that parents always complain about  their kids not doing [ __ ] just tell them  to do it yeah it's like be quiet yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1638240,1644159,they'd be quiet yeah that's exactly how  it worked yeah  yeah three hours seriously be a bit  further away just be firm three hours
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1644159,1649360,sleep i got knowledge or keep them up  later so they're staying lighter yeah  yeah yeah yeah no that's also a good
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1649360,1654480,point as well instead of putting them to  bed and then you sit down we've been  through this weeks ago though like you  know there's people that wake up really
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1654480,1659840,early right you're just going to bed too  early yeah exactly your kids are just  going to bed too early that's exactly  right get some lollies into them around
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1659840,1666799,8 30. yeah it's not about getting them  up if you don't want them up at four  yeah instead of putting them in bed at  seven put them down at nine exactly
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1666799,1672399,sold  you guys should do like a parenting  podcast i reckon yeah i think we just  did
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1672399,1678080,literally i think this will be shared  amongst parents everywhere of how to  sort kids out yeah and get to get down
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1678080,1683120,you'll probably have like a mother's  group on the doorstep trying to kill you  that's what'll happen oh really yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1683120,1688799,we're just trying to help jesus  they're coming after you you try and  tell them kill each other to buy out  buyers
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1688799,1694080,yeah yeah what's your [ __ ] what are you  selling  advice
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1694080,1701120,well what's the podcast going to be  called  uh bacon eddie chat babies
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1705440,1710559,i like it there's something in that yeah  there's something in that yeah could you  imagine though if you did like a like a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1710559,1716480,sacrificial  statistic  satirical  everything you say after this now
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1716480,1722480,unfortunately satirical uh like you just  talked about how you could take care of  kids but it was all just [ __ ] really
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1722480,1727919,interesting to see because like a lot of  mums would like that because you could  make in jokes  on family stuff
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1727919,1733440,but do it in a way where it's kind of  like how you talk about sport do you  like that idea or not i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1733440,1739039,and i resent that because we don't talk  about sports terribly we're 100 serious  about  that's what we are we're a serious
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1739039,1746240,sports show  all right listen how do i think that  would go i don't think that the mums  would take you you need to be really
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1746240,1751440,funny you know what i mean like so what  you're saying what if the mums did it  that's what more that land better the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1751440,1756880,mums did it i think it might land better  than that then  dudes who don't even have kids doing it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1756880,1762080,but that's what's the funny part about  it yeah but you probably wouldn't yeah i  think that's funny you know i mean  there's the irony get it though there's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1762080,1767120,the only here is two white males doesn't  matter talking about
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1773080,1778559,[Laughter]  crazy things have happened we'll start
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1778559,1785279,it up maybe we will  but i'll tell you what you're not  getting a clip of anything we initially  had you this one we initially had you in
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1785279,1790640,and now you're not in don't include are  you saying no to equity you said not  equity well you he said i don't have it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1790640,1796720,i'm saying it's fine but it feels like  you would have said no anyway yeah i  won't say no to free equity but i'm not
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1796720,1803120,going to do anything for it it wouldn't  be free you'd have to do something for  it i'm not doing anything for it [ __ ]  hell no i think that's pretty good over
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1803120,1809279,there i need the coin if you want to see  if you want to see a podcast copy
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1816320,1823640,talk about babies  and how to take care of children yeah  imagine if we went to number one
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1834080,1840960,one week  one week extravaganza and number one  screenshot that in front of it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1840960,1848480,it's in health and lifestyle  that is actually very funny number one  [ __ ] parenting
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1848640,1861590,two dudes  [Laughter]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1861679,1867600,we talk about burden on on monday and  i'm sure you guys did as well but i mean  holy when we talk about a new hot boy
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1867600,1874000,being on the scene there's a new hot boy  in the scene his name is matty burton  yeah he's like what you said about him  where it was like that he's not like you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1874000,1880559,might even have another center running  more maters like doing more sort of like  statistical [ __ ] but every time the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1880559,1885919,opportunity presents itself when someone  like him gets the opportunity to thrust  upon him he just seems to to make it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1885919,1891519,happen yeah 100 percent absolutely  because like he he's kind of like  literally in a different way like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1891519,1898240,latrobe you don't want him running 200  meters getting bashed constantly you  just want those big moments to come and  he nails it but for burn to nail like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1898240,1903919,three or four big moments and like a lot  of people like oh it's just a catching  pass you know how much pressure you're  under like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1903919,1908960,you've got the states  [ __ ] everyone on your shoulders you  know the moment's about to happen you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1908960,1914799,know you're about to get jammed but just  to like the soft hands we see that  stuffed up every week at club every week  and you've got this young guy it's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1914799,1922320,always behind in front 100 times it was  perfect it was literally like he just  had to run like that and he'll land in  his hands tall and um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1922320,1928960,yeah and even the pickup no i don't feel  like people are talking about the pickup  from the first kick yeah i know he's  [ __ ] crazy that kick up p i pick up
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1928960,1934960,and he's he's what six two was about to  say that he's a big [ __ ] boy getting  down [ __ ] it he's huge he's a big boy
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1934960,1940960,stood up still then beat ponga  100 percent had to pick it up step on  like try then the bomb
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1940960,1946640,that that honestly a couple of them yeah  a couple of them but that main one the  main one was [ __ ] probably hyperbolic
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1946640,1952320,but that to me memory-wise maybe i'm  forgetting but memory-wise is the  craziest bomb i've seen in origin
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1952320,1957919,i think it's the biggest it's the  biggest kick i've ever seen it was  [ __ ] my memory crazy and maybe we're
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1957919,1963440,forgetting some great topics from  lockheed or joey or whatever but that  was a torpy slash floater slash [ __ ]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1963440,1968480,whatever it was it was it was it just  went and went and went and like to think
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1968480,1973679,today i'm like bro yeah just like go  just like they said that it kissed god
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1973679,1976960,it did kissed it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1989039,1994960,it you know how it like disappeared like  where's it gone it was within it was  inside god and then it came back out
-E9x0fPVsPQ,1994960,2001279,holy [ __ ] yeah  it was in the air for six days  it's still in the air technically but it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2001279,2007519,broke the speed sound light barriers all  that kind of stuff it was [ __ ] absurd  but like think about that that was i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2007519,2013440,think it was like 42 or three seconds  into the first half his first big bomb  that was that that was his first bomb in
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2013440,2019039,origin and that's what he delivered like  to you is that also a good tactical  thing of just like  you're not kicking at all and then just
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2019039,2025679,adding now it's like yep sets the tone  sets the tone it's actually like this  [ __ ] smitty likes to do it with like the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2025679,2031600,number nine like he always can smith  always really like number nines to kick  early to like set the tone and remind
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2031600,2036960,the defense like oh there's an option  here  smart by freddie to go first kick give
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2036960,2042559,it to burton because now the whole time  everyone's wigging out is burton going  to kick but like to your point earlier
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2042559,2048720,like think about  the you've already had two big moments  and then the third moment is this bomb  that everyone has been talking about all
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2048720,2054960,week all you can see burn bomb burton  bomb burton bomb  he doesn't nail it he kicks the best  bomb of his lot you know what i mean
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2054960,2060480,that's [ __ ] crazy that's [ __ ] how  many times do we see great players  coming in their first game and they have
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2060480,2066480,a bit of a not not great game or they  have a couple of errors he had like  pretty much no areas outside i think one
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2066480,2072720,pass went  but that was i didn't even that was his  fault outside of that he was flawless if  you were just even if you and it's not
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2072720,2078638,like a knock on them but you look at  stags and crichton's first games in  origin starting and you're like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2078638,2084800,they're two great players who just had  nowhere near the same effect that burton  had under 100 percent how do you even
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2084800,2090960,look at like some of the great hojo  justin hodges his origin was a barry  crocker and then he went on to be one of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2090960,2097839,our best outside backs i think even  lockheed had a bit of a quiet or a poor  debut so it's not easy like it really
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2097839,2103920,isn't as easy people think he just makes  it easy he made it look very easy and he  was super calm like he never looked
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2103920,2109440,under the palm no he didn't look under  the pump at all he didn't look rattled  he didn't look frazzled  he handled the contact really well like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2109440,2115200,him giving that pass to tower back to  what you were saying earlier like we had  an overlap there
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2115200,2120800,uh felicia  gone off  so we had to score we needed [ __ ]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2120800,2128160,points we were down at this at that  stage and just wasn't frazzled just so  calm and collected like perfect perfect
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2128160,2133520,perfect pass so one of the great debuts  honestly like i don't know if it's the  best but it's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2133520,2139520,[ __ ] man it's up there it's seriously up  there yeah from center he had a  tri-sister try and a bunch of bombs that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2139520,2144640,like we dropped like from center that's  what he did impacting the game pretty  incredible we love to say bombs of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2144640,2150400,consequences  like he's playing out of position yeah i  know he played there like for a year
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2150400,2156400,incredible man he's special it's going  to be interesting to see what the  doggies do all right we spoke about this  on monday but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2156400,2162240,i think the doggies do keep him like  especially  open their wallets oh [ __ ] they do  they've got to open them how much did
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2162240,2168480,you pay them honestly 800 yeah i reckon  about it yeah but i mean wouldn't  couldn't couldn't now big wano up there
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2168480,2175520,in dolphins land just be like well we  need someone so [ __ ] badly then we  can just blow the bulldogs out of there
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2175520,2181200,you start talking big money for america  well that's what i mean they won't get  monster i don't think you'll get one you  know what it'll be interesting it's like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2181200,2189440,reach out brave burton being like the  next  richard still hasn't reached out now  hates money clearly anyway um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2189440,2195760,you know what is just would be  interesting and look i got no evidence i  don't know what if it's true or not true  but like i wonder whether the bennett
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2195760,2201680,charm would work on the next generation  you know what i mean like burton is  young and he's like new south wales uh
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2201680,2207200,like hasn't had much contact with  bennett would it be as dramatic as him  talking to do you know what i'm saying
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2207200,2213680,this is sort of like how kids these days  don't sort of get how good eminem was  wally lewis for example wally lewis it's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2213680,2219520,like eminem was a good rapper and now  these young kids aren't getting horny  forever yeah they're like oh he's crazy  he's just some [ __ ] yeah so wayne
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2219520,2226560,bennett being eminem he's not having  burton is matt burton listening to lose  yourself or stan well i think he would
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2226560,2233040,listen to lose yourself but  it is interesting to think like would he  be as swayed  by the bennett magic
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2233040,2239040,well  put it this way he was  swayed to leave penrith to go to the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2239040,2244560,dogs because of trent barrett like  that's why he went there that's why he  left so he's obviously more of a more of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2244560,2249920,a a contemporary rapper well yeah you  know maybe like kendrick or something  maybe kellendrick lamar well i don't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2249920,2257000,even know if he's kendrick maybe because  he's trying he's not he's not proven so  maybe he's like the island boys
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2258890,2263930,[Laughter]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2269280,2275440,even if he hasn't had much to do with  wayne  the advice you'd be getting from people  around him yeah yeah and you just got to
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2275440,2282480,look over and go  don't want the iron look what he's done  and look what the island boys have done  you know
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2282880,2288960,but it's it's genuine question like i  wonder whether that next generation is  as odd like for example like being
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2288960,2294480,seriously like i think of the younger  generation would they look to wiley  lewis in all like our parents did no
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2294480,2300079,definitely not you know definitely not  and it's so it's like it's i wonder  whether  that's definitely not that's going to be
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2300079,2305599,a factor in wayne trying to get the next  i guess the difference is with the wally  lewis thing is like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2305599,2311440,you either saw him play or you didn't  and even if you watch highlights it's  just not the same thing yeah where's  wayne's been doing the damn thing like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2311440,2317040,he's wayne is still doing the thing that  wayne's revered for yeah so it's  slightly different but i mean like i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2317040,2322560,also get it like i could see how the  younger generation maybe would be more  horny for you bellamy's than your trent
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2322560,2329040,robinson yeah as a coach yeah well wayne  just  took south to the grand final last year  yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2329040,2335280,exactly it's not like he isn't [ __ ]  he hasn't he's not on the scrappy yeah  he's still out there doing the damn  thing so that would be a small
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2335280,2342400,difference yeah it'd be interesting  though because don't they start  negotiating or they start sitting down  relatively soon i reckon november but he
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2342400,2348800,needs to know he needs to know the  bulldogs coaches that's what he yeah he  come out and said basically he signed  there to go to trent and to be clear we
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2348800,2354039,know wally losers are great we're just  using an example um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2354560,2361599,so yeah with burden yeah you're right  like they if i'm doggies i would have  already been speaking like i would have  already been here's your offer mate like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2361599,2367359,but now after that you'd be going  well we yeah sure we can maybe jack it  up a little bit like yeah but you're
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2367359,2373200,going to have to right he's now an  origin player yeah who's been a good one  that's a good one like it is what it is
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2373200,2378560,mate i think  if you can get him in the seven  somewhere i think you've done pretty  [ __ ] high if you can get him in the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2378560,2384720,sevens that's a massive win i i honestly  think the scary thing for the dogs is if  they're forced to pay a million because
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2384720,2390800,of market pressure  that's what i'm saying i'm not saying  he's worth that i'm saying market  pressure creates that environment where
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2390800,2396240,let's say let's say monster turns around  to bennett and says mate sorry you're  not going bennett goes [ __ ] me i'm
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2396240,2402640,getting desperate now for a half and he  throws a million dollars a burden  and and all of a sudden bulldogs are
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2402640,2408640,[ __ ] that's a [ __ ] dream scenario  if you don't know oh he'd be calling  he'd be called a months ago and working
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2408640,2415440,underway  because the doggy signed burton for
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2415440,2420480,unders and before his career kicked off  and they knew that he was going to be a  gun and gave him that player option like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2420480,2426400,do you reckon they might have planned  for this already  it's like what i said on monday i think  after
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2426400,2433119,the year where he killed it at the  dalian center they they're like i don't  think uh clubs get enough credit for how
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2433119,2438720,deeply they research start statistic  like so much goes into it um i think as
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2438720,2445520,soon as he started playing really well  and was looking like they were gonna win  a premiership they started preparing the  salary cap for that third year or the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2445520,2450880,one third year  sec he's been there a year  so yeah but third year they're
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2450880,2455920,discussing the third yeah yeah so i  reckon that they  because most salary caps are like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2455920,2462000,literally planned like five years in  advance sometimes even 10 years in  advance they try anyway  so yeah maddie
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2462000,2467520,it's a great point like i reckon they  would have already been preparing plus i  also think that gusgul he's ruthless
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2467520,2472800,enough  you know unfortunately and it sucks but  they'd be willing to move on a few
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2472800,2478800,players for him and i don't think  there's enough players with enough clout  that's the wrong word enough
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2478800,2484960,big dogs runs on the board yeah at the  bulldogs to be able to kind of like hold  your ground on that thing as well as  it's a benefit because like let's say
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2484960,2491359,they just need let's say he's on 500k  let's say they just need 300 grand they  all they need to move on let's say  there's a player on 300 grand right now
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2491359,2497920,the doggies him finding another club is  actually easier than a guy on 800 grand  because all he needs to do is find  another club that's willing to pay 150
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2497920,2504480,grand which is a bargain to that club  because they're getting him for 150  because the bulldogs will pay the you  know the difference or whatever
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2504480,2511119,so  yeah really interesting i personally  think he stays i think gus school  has enough pull i think the laundry
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2511119,2516880,group uh shout out london group there  locker room hotel outside out cool  stadium make sure to get down there  that's we had the live show it was a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2516880,2523359,fantastic live show yeah great laundry  group is massive and like big clubs when  you look at like their backing if they
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2523359,2528800,have massive backers like that it's just  so helpful because it just gives you  stability um and so that will help as
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2528800,2533920,well because of all the connections  they'll have so  many coming as well it's like you can't  oh
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2533920,2540480,manny to burton dude that's i mean it's  it's a huge carrot mm-hmm and you'll get  to play a season with him as well
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2540480,2546800,you know he i think what he doesn't need  to resign anyway like he's gonna still  be [ __ ] around next year can he see  another game what i've read it's going
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2546800,2553119,to come down to who's coaching him and  who the [ __ ] knows  we don't seem to be any closer to anyone
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2553119,2558720,that hasn't got a coast to getting a  coach yeah  the tigers i'd rather tigers so
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2558720,2564240,one of the great public knowledge i  don't know why the tigers keep doing  this bro why do i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2564240,2570079,they're like your mate who keeps getting  rejected you're like dude you need to  change your approach at this point the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2570079,2576880,common denominator and all this [ __ ] is  you yeah i i just don't get why  it's not the girls it's not your players
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2576880,2581920,it's not the coach it's you i just don't  know why they go public with it why  don't they because they're desperate but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2581920,2587440,like how does it maybe desperate  privately privately yeah you know what i  mean yeah like the rest of us you can
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2587440,2594000,beg for a route behind closed doors  have some class and dignity yeah get on  your knees behind closed doors that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2594000,2599040,public affection [ __ ] doesn't work never  when you hop up in the school ground on  the table and professionally work for
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2599040,2604800,heath ledger that's it he's the only man  yeah but he's the only bloke that ever  pulled only blinders don't have leading
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2604800,2610960,man good looks they're not rom-com he's  legit good looks like they're their  [ __ ] ugly friend in this thing it's  like you're not gonna have to jump on a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2610960,2616079,table and get the hottest bird in town  it's just not gonna happen the crickets  literally crickets after you stop
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2616079,2622880,singing yeah you're just too good to be  true you hear this big  young kid in crazy stupid love who wants
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2622880,2629040,to get  the older girl yeah the nanny  it's just not going to happen gets a  nude at the end serato might be like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2629040,2634880,he's a nude but yeah i'm like  i've sent him a couple notes just well i  think maybe to soften the blow sorry i  can't come but it is a picture of my
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2634880,2640319,dick yeah and they're like you know what  fair play because sir because uh siraldo
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2640319,2645599,who is the  the nanny in this situation wants the  older guy who's the older guy maybe the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2645599,2652400,older guys feel good  yeah maybe ceraldo wants that doggy's  gig  oh
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2652400,2657599,maybe you know what i'm gonna get back  with burton he's boy burton well because  then he's back with his boy burton and  he likes to look at that side he likes
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2657599,2662960,to look at the back end of the stability  there you know what i mean i tell you  what the doggies after their last couple
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2662960,2668319,wins if they can keep doing this  they're looking very appealing because  they're on the up like they truly are on
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2668319,2676079,the up now they've got two [ __ ] legit  players coming next year and you're  getting a  sick nine which is gonna help burton a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2676079,2682400,lot 100 oh massively it's going to help  the whole side i feel like jerry  marshall king's improved a lot but i  just think reed's probably just a little
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2682400,2688640,bit just a little bit better but  marshall king's definitely he's a lot  better disrespectful like he's an origin  quality yeah yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2688640,2690960,probably
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2696800,2703520,he's every time he runs the ball there's  a problem like you know what i mean like  every time he [ __ ] runs the ball he  skittles defenders it's [ __ ] mental
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2703520,2710319,um  but yeah we wouldn't shock me if i want  to talk quickly about  so bulldogs put up a uh
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2710319,2715359,so burton's bomb we all just saw our  incredible was something we've never  seen before beautiful beautiful all that

-E9x0fPVsPQ,2820560,2825839,matt burton highlight from here on in or  nfl where you at  just keep tagging them
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2825839,2831680,because it's like oh yeah we need like  because i could the nfl could look like  this young hot throbber in australia we  spent a million dollars it's just a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2831680,2837119,million dollars worth of marketing in  australia for nfl we're trying to grow  the game there we chuck him on as a  kicker because he's clearly got a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2837119,2843119,[ __ ] boot on him we're laughing we're  good to go we're literally he cannot  affect the you know i mean like it's not  like another signing where he's like a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2843119,2849520,wide running receiver wide receiver or  whatever that can kind of like if you  put him in affects the game that much  he's just a [ __ ] just get a big boot
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2849520,2856079,on him you wonder because his kick is  like it's just a punch it's i just we've  never seen anything no like you've never  seen it yeah and it's just like oh okay
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2856079,2861359,yeah sure we'll just take you yeah and  as if you're matt burton obviously  you've got [ __ ] you want to do and then  i know but you've already won a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2861359,2867119,premiership you're about to win a  [ __ ] origin and so you just go  okay now i might go and get paid [ __ ]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2867119,2872880,couple of mill in the nfl  go down go down and quickly get the [ __ ]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2875920,2881839,at the end of the day  you know you're playing with fire and  yeah maybe it's unlikely but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2881839,2889200,is the juice worth the squeeze for 60  comments i don't know if it is i really  mean it it's like 60 moving the needle
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2889200,2894400,listen eddie it's about engagement you  know it's just about engaging tell you  what we're talking about their page  right now go follow the internal
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2894400,2900400,bulldogs well underscore bulldogs you  know what bulldogs are a step ahead yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2900400,2905520,this would get talked about the bulldogs  now get promoted and they they've  already signed burton up for another few
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2905520,2911200,years so he can't break contract  um  have you seen where the most petty man
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2911200,2917280,alive drake so someone left a comment on  drake's post or something and i was like  is he his pet he's kelly slater what
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2917280,2923280,told you you tell me you tell me kelly's  pretty petty i'm about to tell you you  tell me okay um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2923280,2929839,so someone said like your music [ __ ] or  something along those lines anyway so  drake literally went and followed that  dude's wife
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2929839,2936160,and then i think like  sliding slid into her dms or something  and was like what's up and [ __ ] up i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2936160,2943040,know about that last week  so you know what i'm talking about yeah  yeah just because some dude comments if  you're a dragon i would probably do that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2943040,2948880,a bit if i was drake and then you had  people talking [ __ ] you're like i think  that would be a very satisfying way  obviously i'm gonna do it you just go on
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2948880,2956078,like okay [ __ ] i would never do  it but it's funny to watch i reckon i  might if i was saying guys
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2966079,2971119,we're talking about drizzy who  absolutely embodied meek mill and he  said is that a good is that a welter or
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2971119,2977680,a girls tour you reckon he wouldn't  sleep with you i don't know enough about  drake's lyrics to be able to go with you  on this one okay sorry i only know like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2977680,2984640,kiki  you got rhythm bro yeah thank you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2986880,2993839,what do you reckon would be more  interesting me and eddie talking about  parenthood are you talking about hip-hop  oh you two on parenthood i mean my my
-E9x0fPVsPQ,2993839,2999640,hip-hop my hip-hop sort of knowledge  that happened
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3002720,3008800,listen i think that it's probably the  baby podcast i'd like to see you guys at  number one yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3008800,3014640,it's a dream of mine you know what it is  actually the pregnancy podcast or the  parenthood podcast it's a german mind
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3014640,3020319,yeah obviously all right equity but  that's a that's about all right now but  you decline declaration no i said i'll  take it it's on it's literally on record
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3020319,3025440,i said i'll take action you said i  wasn't he said nothing yet no i couldn't  it's 50 50 sorry bro you said no you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3025440,3031440,said no as a matter of fact you know  what let's throw let's say maddie he's  equity yeah maddie can have it now  you've got equity now maddie
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3031440,3037040,maddie i'm taking the number one health  and beauty oh hello  i'm taking that activity sorry
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3037040,3043520,you've got to wrestle for it yeah i'm  taking it  um so look at michael b jordan at drake
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3043520,3049599,at nfl  run the risk run the risk living  dangerously that's for sure  um now
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3049599,3057039,uh fox talking points international  edition oh anything else about the game  that's about you boys seriously origin
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3057280,3063599,you know i don't think he's getting  enough credit for this series i thought  he was good in game one for you and he  was a really good game too i think  jerome law has been good like really
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3063599,3069040,good yeah he's been great two tries this  game won  try trices i think gave two yep i think
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3069040,3074240,he's been good back three oh [ __ ] you  up yeah i ran for like 750 meters i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3074240,3079520,think it was like 220 post contact me  had like 30 tackle breaks nearly between  three of them yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3079520,3084720,i think we ran for more post  post-contact meters than your back three  ran for meters that's correct daddy
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3084720,3089839,that's correct is it yep  i don't know if that's true no that is  true you guys did [ __ ] absolutely
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3089839,3097720,it's true now to be honest i think there  were certain people who were trying to  say pcms  7100
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3098400,3104640,so what 240. i'll look at it yeah you  know what you might be right no we are  right oh actually
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3104640,3111119,so what it's 200 kiki do you love 230  [Music]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3111119,3116160,and then cell 164 would be about  two seconds close 290 would say 290
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3116160,3123200,close and then 100  70 so 172 and then oh no just short but  still no pretty close you've got 250
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3123200,3129119,post contact meters  that's [ __ ] close though  that's scary  that's hectic that's po that's pcm
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3129119,3135599,that's pcms it's it's almost like it's  almost like ten one pcm meter is like  five normal meters maybe even ten i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3135599,3141920,think ten seriously um so technically  three where they get a [ __ ] they're  just trucking up that's so hard for
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3141920,3147839,queensland also have queenslanders every  time you're back three around the ball  you would bend our line and we couldn't  no matter how much we've shot out and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3147839,3153440,try to hit use these were so hard to  tackle brian  oh my god he's one of the great line
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3153440,3160400,benders of all time seriously is he the  best ball running  outside back we've seen bruh probably
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3160400,3165920,like because i know blake ferguson had a  great year where he ran for a bunch of  meters but he's so strong soldier does
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3165920,3171359,it every year he does this yeah this is  his second year now where he is  think about this like he he's ran for
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3171359,3177119,261 meters 101 post contact nine tackle  breaks and two line breaks two offloads
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3177119,3182800,in an origin game that's [ __ ] crazy  from the wing and our kicking game was  so elite that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3182800,3187920,you're often coming from way like super  deep out of your own half well like  ponga was catching a lot of them and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3187920,3193920,falling over yeah a lot of those burton  bombs the big [ __ ] all the or the  nathan knuckle like he'd catch and fall
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3193920,3200559,over and then  you know  rip and tear then 100  like again i don't think toro's getting
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3200559,3206480,enough reps to run for 261 meters a try  nine tackle breaks two line breaks as a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3206480,3211520,as a winger  that's one of the [ __ ] great wear  knocks seriously and he does it all the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3211520,3217119,time yeah he literally does it every  game like so game one he had  he might have been
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3217119,3224800,ten tackle breaks game one i think he  had back to back 200 maybe yeah so 207  meters eight tackle breaks 76 pcms uh
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3224800,3231599,five tackles zero misses [ __ ] man rock  solid rock solid that's great and then  last last year was [ __ ] just as good
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3231599,3237520,[ __ ] we love that new south wales spirit  um thoughts on the appy chorus  cook
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3237520,3243520,situation what do you think do you think  it worked didn't work or it didn't not  work  which is a fair point like it's a good
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3243520,3248839,like it wasn't crazy but it also didn't  work  you didn't watch it and go [ __ ] this  isn't working
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3248839,3255200,yeah you're hearing you're hearing the  yarn about like  when people are talking about our center  selection so the next game was like well
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3255200,3261200,you could just have  uh whiteness the 14 which to me is like  oh okay so one of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3261200,3266319,either cook or chorus i was going there  but i liked i liked seeing happy go  there like how many times did he make he
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3266319,3271599,made 35 tackles or something like what i  liked he was only on the field for
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3271599,3277119,half of what half an hour yeah about 30  minutes what i liked about appi's role  is it was truly just to take the bun out
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3277119,3283680,of the game like he was on there for 30  and just tackled his dick off so in 34  minutes he had 23 tackles only one
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3283680,3288960,missed um  because like if you're going by that so  34 minutes you're looking at like nearly
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3288960,3295040,50 tackles 50  that's a  so
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3295040,3302160,yeah i didn't mind it it's just tough  now because how do you fit white on the  bench who would you play at center as  new south wales fan and let's assume
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3302160,3307200,troll comes out plays solidly just  solidly not quite and drop kratom trell
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3307200,3312960,out  he plays solidly not spectacular but he  looks fit healthy gets through a bunch
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3312960,3318799,of work he doesn't kill it but he gets  through a bunch of work played solely so  his fitness is not a question
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3318799,3324079,personally honestly i'd pick latrell  personally yeah but i but i'm not going
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3324079,3330079,to be upset if they don't yeah you know  what i mean like i understand that he's  under done he hasn't played a whole lot  of footy but like if you want
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3330079,3336160,if you want a [ __ ] to do  something when the chips are down you  know he can create out of nothing and i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3336160,3341839,just that x factor there would in  suncorp 2 i feel like you're going to  need like a special moment you're not
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3341839,3348640,saying because it's going to be it's  like realistically it's not going to be  like that i know m2 is not going to be  game three i don't think crichton is
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3348640,3354480,playing game three  yeah  he's probably pretty [ __ ] solid
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3354480,3359839,okay he's been right i mean but he also  looked at the [ __ ] mr tackle for the  monster truck which in origin it's it's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3359839,3366400,like  those moments count more than they might  know in the sense of like oh yeah he's  been solid but that truck that led to
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3366400,3372079,yeah you're picking between white and it  was meant a match for new south wales  game one i think like the the tough
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3372079,3378240,thing is crichton's the type of player  that's going to take him a little bit to  warm into that role like i i see what  you mean though i'm saying game three
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3378240,3385359,decide like yeah i think you want to  play again but like yeah yeah and i can  see that point i feel a bit i feel a bit  for cricket because like he hasn't been
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3385359,3392640,terrible by any stretch um but he's just  been put in  positions where burt and white have  played so [ __ ] good yeah it's a tough
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3392640,3399119,one it's a really tough one it's  with whiteon playing so good game one  i don't know what you do could would you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3399119,3405520,guys be open so let's say i don't think  you should take cook or happy out of the  squad i think you should keep him what  you did going to would you consider
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3405520,3412079,whiten swapped in for talakai or do you  think that's too small on the bench hmm  he didn't play much did he talk he
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3412079,3417200,played about 17 minutes  three tackles
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3417200,3423599,and 33 right four runs  i'm not ant yet  not anti but i do like having a bit of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3423599,3429920,thickness squared in the side or cubed  to be specific well the concern would be  is is like if a front row goes down like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3429920,3435839,head knock injury or whatever then you  basically you've got to move probably  crying into the center and then bring on
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3435839,3442319,white and maybe on an edge  look it's tough i don't i don't envy  this sort of selection
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3442319,3447920,i think whiten goes in answer it i think  whiten goes in phone call mid-show i got
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3447920,3453200,[ __ ] roasted last week  phone call mid show the unprofessional
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3453200,3458799,get over it bro  [ __ ] ridiculous  oh yeah [ __ ] yeah look i'd i wouldn't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3458799,3464640,be shocked honestly if freddie went  burton and white  yeah neither do i if i had to guess and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3464640,3472000,then everything's the same if i had to  guess i think that's what he'll do  i want to also shout out junior polo
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3472000,3478720,paul  paolo  i keep getting her wrong like i keep  saying bolo but i think it's pollo

-E9x0fPVsPQ,3581680,3587520,did you like what every three months you  went on a holiday like overseas or uh  every three months no well school  wouldn't allow that but surely you had
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3587520,3592559,pulled to like yeah no look there was no  point doing that because obviously  studies came first not for you you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3592559,3601640,dropped out but like ah studies came  first in my household but look dropping  out hasn't happened you are now worthy
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3610160,3615640,a little bit  well no i found it ironic that's for  sure
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3616319,3623839,so how how long were you in pj for like  what were you in fiji for isn't always  the holidays but how long have you been  there for to know the words well so i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3623839,3630000,would go there all the time growing up  but so the way that uh there was the  fiji fijian we are for the crusaders
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3630000,3635520,i think his last name was like the way  it was read was vonnie barker and i  would that would always like it's like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3635520,3642960,there's certain words or there's certain  like sounds where there's like a letter  before something so like v-u-n-i-b-a-k
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3642960,3649520,von nibaka is nimbaka like there's oh  gamma like shakira's actually
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3649520,3654839,oh okay  i believe blue okay you're on research  but so i like to
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3654839,3660880,uh i can't nail much but i think i  nailed it well you're good the other day  that was [ __ ] crazy yeah yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3660880,3666480,denim's worth 40 million  it's random number just this random  number yeah it's 50 that's [ __ ] hell
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3666480,3671480,i would love to see that that random  though it's random
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3681520,3686720,what is really under is the mad dog  money mad dog monster that's what's  under it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3686720,3693200,yeah one of one that thing's worth 20  grand  it is actually because he's such a  [ __ ] legend yep but he gave to me for
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3693200,3698720,it because her mates um  yeah okay what were we up to fox would  uh
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3698720,3706319,what were we up to what were we doing  talking points we're talking about  origin uh and junior plan do you i  thought that was one of junior's best um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3706319,3712720,origin games i thought it was massive  for you guys they were saying can't  remember where i heard it that the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3712720,3718880,the direction from freddie must have  been to tell junior it's just a truck  number yeah chuck norris don't try and  offload it don't try to play the ball
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3718880,3725280,just [ __ ] shock that thing dude  [ __ ] sometimes you need tom in your  life in fact a lot of the time you need
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3725280,3731200,all well he's an umph based selection  he's all off so if you come out then you  start trying to throw off loads you're
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3731200,3736240,going away from what you're selected he  plays that role at club so he's tough  for him like he doesn't play a lot of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3736240,3741640,people you've got to hit ump first i  think he's here at junior pool
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3753440,3758480,though that's [ __ ] brave as [ __ ] yeah  well junior polo  yeah i mean you're just sucking him up
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3758480,3764640,for doing his job which is cool i get it  it's queensland you just you know you  make the tackle  how impressive that kid tried to make a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3764640,3769760,table  yeah i mean  i [ __ ] trying to make a tackle in  origin you would most queensland most
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3769760,3775440,queenslanders you would have seen him  just they would have just rolled over  teddy would have gone like this oh i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3775440,3781119,slipped over teddy you're hearing this  [ __ ] teddy  you're hearing this [ __ ] about it you're  here and this [ __ ] this guy's calling
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3781119,3786960,yourself you clip this thing up next  time kemp he comes in here and we're not  calling pong assassin all we're saying  is
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3786960,3793599,all he was doing was doing his job  the difference between me and thomas tom  is actually spiteful he calls people out
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3793599,3796880,what are you doing i don't call anyone  now
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3801039,3807440,i'm here supporting rugby league  there's an origin and the concept and  your idea of [ __ ] [ __ ] on teddy's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3807440,3813520,the concert  where would you where would you  seriously where would you rate teddy in  origin like players because i honestly
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3813520,3819280,have him up there as one of the best  sergeant players at least of the last  generation like put it this way skip oh
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3819280,3826160,he's right up there almost  he's an all-time hit for new south wales  he would probably make my all-time side
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3826160,3832880,like i know minnie is incredible  no and maybe and maybe there's some  other people minnie was good but teddy
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3832880,3839039,would put it this way new south wales  all time 17 teddy makes it for me  what do you reckon i'd have to i'd have
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3839039,3844720,teddy in the one i think i think i  probably would have teddy in there um  i wouldn't necessarily skip already but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3844720,3851520,no i'm saying our skipper at the moment  yeah yeah yeah he wouldn't be skipper do  you think he gets appreciated though  because off the bench
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3851520,3857599,correct do you think he gets enough  appreciation though teddy for how good  like he he is  to those that know what they're talking
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3857599,3863359,about he gets all the pro he gets like a  [ __ ] load of praise to the layman  probably not as much because a lot of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3863359,3868880,the stuff that he does  isn't like super tangible you know what  i mean right just so much effort yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3868880,3874319,like you gotta go to the rugby league  fan not to the fan to the rugby league  like either former player or people who
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3874319,3879760,played a shitload of rugby league like  they you sort of get you you can  appreciate it a bit more or there are
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3879760,3885599,things the as you say like the effort  plays and things that whereas i'm  potentially looking at
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3885599,3892240,you know  broken tries but like i feel like he  does that but i think he's more of a  victim of like he's so consistent that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3892240,3897440,you just expected well that as well he's  exactly he's like a nine and a half ten  constantly like i'm trying to think of a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3897440,3902559,bad origin game that he's played and  he's so safe a hundred percent like so
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3902559,3908720,so so every game he's like minimum  nearly 200 meters i'd love to maybe  could you could you just get his stats
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3908720,3914480,up for origin  just so that we can see like we can uh  year in year out what he does uh yeah i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3914480,3920319,personally believe like like for example  last year  tom travoy rachel chow easily the two
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3920319,3925359,best players of the series teddy was  [ __ ] amazing last year in any other  year he wins player of the series what
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3925359,3931200,do you got what'd you say average is 200  meters a game i honestly reckon averages  200 meters game in origin 195.
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3931200,3938240,there you go  in origin he averages he averages 195 so  he's played he's played 18 games
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3938240,3946559,28 points 13 prices 13 line break assist  195 meters a game 25 18 games of origin
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3946720,3952640,i don't know if this is up to  the last game  that's what i mean though like i don't  think he gets enough like put into the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3952640,3957680,greatest challenge he did in 2016 game  three was almost the best player on the  field and that's been raised
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3957680,3963200,ever since yeah and that's what i mean  like when you talk about origin greats i  don't think teddy gets talked about but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3963200,3969520,he [ __ ] has the right like look at  his stats tell me any other player that  has stats like that five tackle breaks a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3969520,3976400,game too five tackle breaks a game  average in origin  in already horny and so i think it's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3976400,3983760,time  like let's put it  if teddy if if new south wales go up and  do win this decider oh then you have to
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3983760,3989520,put teddy in all like in the all-time  great chat for sure for sure for sure  skip leads us up there and [ __ ] gets
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3989520,3994640,the chockies but do you is are you  picking up what i'm putting down do you  feel that i'm feeling it i'm feeling you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,3994640,4001599,dude i'm feeling what are you what do  you reckon maddie am i hitting or what  no no i actually had this discussion  recently the pub he's definitely
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4001599,4007280,from what i've seen the best new south  wales fullback and he'd be there's a lot  been a lot of good players but he'd  almost be in my top ten tell you what
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4007280,4013119,point of view anyway i know people are  trying to sell papers i get that i know  you're in the paper selling business but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4013119,4020000,to imply at the start of every origin  series that or should we replace  vlog probably no offense to you but like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4020000,4025119,let's be fed income what are you on  about but that's what i mean though like  think about it tell me anyone that will
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4025119,4031920,be talking about like oh should cam  smith get replaced or billy slater get  replaced like i know when he got injured  that one you did but outside of that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4031920,4037920,in his peak of his career no one was  saying billy slater should get replaced  but every year teddy gets questioned and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4037920,4044160,you're like he's an all-time great for  new south wales yeah dribblers dude you  know what i mean  i think there's like a shitload of like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4044160,4050079,you know you've got tommy winning dally  m fullback like dalian and he's playing  fullback like you you've got these
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4050079,4057440,really good two other like guys who are  awesome  but it's like  this is stacked yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4057440,4063680,but no in no way should teddy be missing  out no way no way but yeah i reckon he  deserves to be talked about in the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4063680,4069440,especially if you win this series i  think he puts himself in that all-time  great territory and i i also think that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4069440,4075440,if he continues on the trajectory and  roosters come back and you know win a  premiership or two you've got to you've  got to make the case that he challenges
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4075440,4080799,billy slater for all time if he  continues this not yet but i think that  you'd have to make the case that teddy
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4080799,4087200,how old is he 27 i think he's young he's  not i think he's 27 28. but i think he's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4087200,4093039,he's 20 29 29. so i think he's in the  realms of  could end up being
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4093039,4099199,a top three full-back of all time  yep he's not he's not sleepy he's not  not he's i think he's close to slater
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4099199,4105040,yet he's been he's on a trajectory  that's very good but slater was just a  [ __ ] another level at least yeah yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4105040,4110640,i still think so  you're not going to be reasonable to  challenge him i don't think it depends
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4110640,4117120,it depends  what it looks like when it's all said  and done at the moment  like if you put their careers together i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4117120,4123679,don't think that he's  no teddy teddy has won i think  more pr like as many premierships as
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4123679,4129679,billy had won by this stage if you take  away the salary cup ones i actually  think he might have won more by this
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4129679,4137120,stage because he's what he's won two so  far  if  i think he's gonna win another  premiership or two to challenge billy um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4137120,4144159,but i definitely i think that if you had  him in your top three all-time  full-backs  if consistency was a key indicator like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4144159,4151278,if you're looking at one-off seasons in  that you couldn't have them top three  all the time now  or you is that what you're saying maybe
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4151278,4157920,what i'm saying is i wouldn't be i  wouldn't be like that's a [ __ ] stupid  crazy take  i wouldn't be that against it if someone
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4157920,4163278,wanted to entertain it yeah i wouldn't  be like that's [ __ ] mental whereas if  you said like i don't know
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4163278,4169440,um  oh [ __ ] i don't know who else i would  say but i just don't reckon that he gets  enough respect for how well he plays so
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4169440,4175278,billy was 29 same age as teddy in 2012  when storm won that premiership for a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4175278,4180400,comparison okay so he was 29 in 2012.  well he's 39 now so yeah so he won he'd
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4180400,4187758,won that was his first that was his  first well third or first half how are  you looking at salary cup well third
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4187838,4193520,yeah interesting and it's obviously then  then they won  2017.17 yep so two more
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4193520,4199600,um yeah interesting really interesting  but yeah if he keeps on this trajectory  i think he's at least top five oh he's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4199600,4204880,i'd say he's surely knew that i was best  ever full back yeah yeah [ __ ] half of  you and you could argue well this isn't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4204880,4211040,our top three then it's him and many  well you're lucky  like it's  i guess maybe just when you're still
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4211040,4216560,playing it's different it's yeah it's  tough to say tough to say and there's a  good argument and this includes jared  hayne that he's been our best blues
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4216560,4222400,player since joey  yeah  when you think about it well who else
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4222400,4229199,has been better  turbo potentially just in the short few  games yeah i i consistent like is in i'm
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4229199,4234880,not saying that he's not consistent but  like just because he's had so many  injuries it's hard tommy's a really hard  one to place because he hasn't really
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4234880,4241840,played it like that paul gallon was  consistent yeah he was [ __ ] for a  long time yeah that was pretty [ __ ]  good uh anyway just just thought i'd uh
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4241840,4247920,just let us know what you think in the  comment section where do you rate teddy  at the moment uh now on to uh did you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4247920,4255120,guys get a chance to watch some of the  international games i did yeah uh kiwi  cement themselves world cup favorites  with australia that's this is fox sports
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4255120,4261520,talking points guys uh so the kiwis  cement themselves as well cup favorites  with australia australia is at uh a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4261520,4267600,dollar thirty six  uh to win new zealand's at seven dollars  twenty five dollars that's values
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4267600,4273920,them being 75 shorter than england is  [ __ ] absurd who set that mark
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4273920,4280400,england at eight dollars is a joke they  should be like 75 cents more than  england that's crazy or less than
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4280400,4285520,england like you've lost your [ __ ]  mind i'd be  listen if you're a partner person i'd be
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4285520,4291040,gobbling up new zealand at 7 25. yeah  that is value i will say and i agree  with you all but i recommend that short
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4291040,4297280,because it's their home world cup  australia or that short nana england  england yeah that's a good point but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4297280,4302320,what i just i don't know like  they're not good  i'm just saying that's probably why i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4302320,4308400,can see your point though like england  you're away from home you know it's it  is it is a long world cup
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4308400,4314400,um and they did they were they made the  grand final of last world cup they only  lost by four so yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4314400,4320239,i can kind of see that i personally  would have them probably in between  tolerant samoa maybe even yeah in
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4320239,4326239,between tongue and samoa maybe even  if someone would get all their players  back i would even have maybe someone
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4326239,4333280,just in front of them like someone when  you look at their squad of who they  could have if they chose to play for  their heritage or whatever it's a hectic
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4333280,4339040,side like crazy side  but interesting so anyway where do you  guys see new zealand did you what did
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4339040,4345840,you see on the weekend do you think this  is one of the better new zealand squads  we've seen in a very long time mate with  jerome hughes at seven
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4345840,4353360,and then dual bags at six and joey mata  one [ __ ] nice and cheese at nine like  that's a [ __ ] nice spine [ __ ] oath
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4353360,4359920,and you need a conductor and jerome  hughes at seven i'm like  it just it takes them to another level i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4359920,4365400,think they're [ __ ] red-hot mate very  very 400 meters joey manu is
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4365400,4372159,unbelievable 400 meters he's so silky  mate [ __ ] and he's massive and strong
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4372159,4380400,too [ __ ] big strong and hot because  that's all is he's he's six three six  four four six four pinch mate
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4380560,4385400,have we given him six six i'll give him  six six
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4389360,4394800,we were going on and on and on and on  and on about the tongan side going in  and rightly so but new zealand were like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4394800,4398960,bra  listen  you're
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4402080,4408080,no i think he wasn't there though i  think they were being coached by someone  else well that makes sense because if it  was christian i know he wouldn't have
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4408080,4413760,left ola kawatu on the bench until the  50th minute when the game was already  gone because that to me as a person
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4413760,4419040,who's never coached rugby league  professionally is the dumbest decision  maybe in the history of rugby league i  don't know how he wasn't starting yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4419040,4425440,well that too that too two dumb  decisions the fallback rower of the  entire competition can't get a [ __ ]  start struck twice and it was a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4425440,4431280,lightning bolt of stupidity  um it does show you the importance of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4431280,4438400,the spine like which is why i like i  think new zealand are [ __ ] the value  of 725 given that their spine is
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4438400,4443760,it's just it's just a matter of now new  zealand living up to the hype like  that that seems to be their achilles
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4443760,4449040,heel where they go into these world cups  sometimes with a bunch of hype you look  at their squad and you're like wow and  they just
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4449040,4455080,just don't seem to to put it all  together um in saying that they've what  they won 2008 world cup
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4455080,4460400,2013 or 12 12.  they've won two world cups they weren't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4460400,4469320,two world cups so actually you know what  new zealand yeah are they 108 world cup  and they won the four nations in twenty
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4469600,4474800,yeah there has been times where they've  been really hyped up with this crazy  spine and they just didn't seem to
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4474800,4480800,deliver whereas i think that this is  this is a chance for them to with  michael mcguire's coach who was a very
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4480800,4487360,kind of old-school tough defensive coach  and a lot of their rhetoric has been  around we want to be the best defensive
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4487360,4494159,side in the world cup  i like that rhetoric from new zealand  like they're coming out with that kind  of mindset because their attack will
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4494159,4500159,no new zealand side ever has ever had to  struggle to score points like they can  always be  like they're always the best attacking
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4500159,4505440,players in new zealand well up there  with the best it's just about um making  sure the defense is strong and it was
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4505440,4511840,strong on the weekend it was strong on  the weekend so very exciting times in  new zealand very exciting times

-E9x0fPVsPQ,4608239,4614320,by anyone yet um  thoughts on the lodge to the roosters i  mean seems like a [ __ ] good signing
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4614320,4620000,for them doesn't it  seems like  exactly he's like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4620000,4625199,i still want to know what the [ __ ]  happened oh mate seriously you know what  i mean it happened so bad that you get
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4625199,4631920,paid out not even that year all 700 work  the next year as well  it's it plays on my mind from time yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4631920,4637199,yeah what the [ __ ] happened there you  sit up and out of bed you know that'll  catch you i need to get the momentum out
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4637199,4643760,of another woman that's just no i don't  know what i'm thinking about the  warriors yeah we uh we need to get the  mayo man onto it but dude no one's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4643760,4649679,[ __ ] said bo [ __ ] peep about this  no  roost is good pick up for 100k thanks
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4649679,4655360,for coming i thought that  minimum of 20 grand a game for the  remainder of the season so that's like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4655360,4662080,mark i think it was like a couple of  hundred dollars  too much well no because it's like  you're paying a percentage of the value
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4662080,4667280,so like it was again  it stops from going it's like 10 more
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4667280,4672880,rounds 200 grand yeah that's what  they're saying it's not parasiting for  leo yeah or far or someone for minimum
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4672880,4677920,views you can't pay under the place  they're saying that's what his value is  over the course of like a whole year so
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4677920,4684480,you're going  to for the remaining game of the season  you've got to pay him like it was like  200 or 250 they've got to pay him
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4684480,4692320,again on top of your seven  [ __ ] matt lodge the highest paid  player in rugby league he's killing it  made a lot of money
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4694080,4699199,he's actually like he's kind of like  what they need at the moment too just  another big front row arc just to bring
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4699199,4704800,a bit of energy in the middle arch  which is scary because again i still  think roosters are a side that can um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4704800,4710320,shatter starch shout out to stuff that's  starch what is it different to umph yes  starch yeah which is a bit more go
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4710320,4715920,forward starch is jake in the middle  [ __ ] you're not getting through me  you're getting no pcms against starch
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4715920,4722320,okay so it's a defensive kind of yeah  it's like defense version of yeah yeah  starch is just like presence in the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4722320,4729440,middle okay anti-pcm what what if you've  got a hundred percent of starch yes  starch is the kryptonite to pcm well but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4729440,4735040,you know when they say what happens on  an unstoppable yeah infant starts
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4750500,4756880,[Music]  recruitment continues uh  cook has come out and said i want to
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4756880,4763920,finish my career here and i feel like i  could play until 35 or 36 i'd love three  years and i'd call it quits after that  just so i could finish with south sydney
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4763920,4768960,sounds loyal sounds like he wants to  stay you know what happens usually when  [ __ ] when south players come out and say
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4768960,4774080,they want to stay they [ __ ] them off so  i was about to say is this blake asking  for the three-year deal and he's in his
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4774080,4780800,30s yeah cooked to the dolphins he  couldn't possibly be asking for the  broncos  you don't have a hooker dear
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4780800,4786239,billy walter's doing it all right but  look  he's been going okay  i mean he's no australian new south
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4786239,4791679,wales representative  champion  look  i don't think there's a hope in hell
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4791679,4797760,that cook gets a three-year deal no he's  in his 30s  he won't get a two-year deal no he won't  he won't well he'll get offered one and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4797760,4804960,then they'll go but then you're [ __ ]  off you get a one-year deal with a  three-year  club option yeah oh the odd three-year
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4804960,4810960,club actually you know what a 10-year  club option they'll throw the 10-year  club option so yeah we might do it yeah  let's see how it goes yeah it's funny
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4810960,4817920,he's not just in his 30s he's 31 now and  the deal would start in 24. so he'll be  32 and a half i'm the three when it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4817920,4823360,starts if they if they give it to him  like that'll officially just now i think
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4823360,4829040,they want to sign cody until he's 43 so  they'll probably let him go  and re-up coaching should start offering
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4829040,4835760,like just 10-year club options just like  you signed a 11-year deal but it's like  10 years club options so yeah it's like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4835760,4841120,you can help out in the canteen and [ __ ]  like yeah once you're well but like a  10-year option where you just don't have  to take it up
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4841120,4846040,like yeah yeah we'll give you an 11-year  deal but 10.
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4849520,4856000,he's clearly not loyal yeah can we send  you a letter every year again i'm sorry  bro sorry bro i'm gonna say just like in  all seriousness he
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4856000,4861600,the point of the article was that cook  said he didn't really start playing  regular first grade until he's 25
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4861600,4867120,so that will give him years actually  years at the end of his career  i don't know if that's how it works
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4867120,4872719,that's not how it works that's not how  aging i don't think if you start playing  first grade at 30 you can play to your
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4872719,4877840,45. no  oh no well you're telling me that  technically if we were to get in shape
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4877840,4882880,out of you and i could be playing to a  55 60. that's what i'm hearing based on
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4882880,4888719,based on cook maths yeah dragon they  should start signing six year olds real  cheap because they can play those 70s  exactly
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4888719,4894159,and they've already lost them for a deal  oh hang on are you 80 and you haven't  started playing first grade footy well
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4894159,4900080,you're probably playing [ __ ] 80 years  you've already got your life saving you  need a big contract that's actually
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4900080,4905920,genius from south yeah and from cooking  only debut people when they're 30 years  old yeah because they can play with

-E9x0fPVsPQ,4911920,4917760,or don't even sell them just [ __ ] them  off and then let's sets let's start  something like guys are like 50 years  old yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,4917760,4923760,because we'll save a bitcoin but then  they can play to like 75 because i  haven't played any footy yeah and  playing footy yeah

-E9x0fPVsPQ,5305040,5310800,that doesn't happen i think we're in for  a good old-fashioned humping thumping  all of that good stuff i think jerome
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5310800,5316880,hughes come out put on an absolute  clinic uh i think harry grant he's  looking hot his hair is wavy it's all
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5316880,5323719,surfing  he's he was dejected no he go he lost
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5324800,5330159,he goes to beach areas and plays his  best footy because he's a surfy kind of  bloke he feels at home he he knows the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5330159,5336000,vibe the feel of his beach town and he  gets the job done man of the match harry  grant no i don't think so the kid loves
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5336000,5341840,surfing loves waves and he knows if he's  going to get a [ __ ] wave on the  beaches he's going to roll over
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5341840,5347120,let us get a dub she's going to get  flogged in the surface  if he wins yeah if he wins you'll get
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5347120,5353520,flogged no but he won't win but also  like you know if you want to get  accepted on the beaches you've got to  surf desi's hair and if you haven't done
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5353520,5359520,that then you're a real surfer on the  beaches so you mean you can have a crack  it up he's going to get flogged get off  our way bro
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5359520,5366000,wow so if they lose are we putting this  up to the fact that harry graham was  scared of getting bashed out in the surf  the next day certainly something to do i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5366000,5371760,think that he yes if they win  don't go surfing he's just gonna he  wouldn't have bought his board yeah if
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5371760,5377280,he did  stay out of the water  stay out of the water
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5386320,5391840,whatever you want it's going to be a win  a win of substance  um i think it's going to be a substant
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5391840,5397760,some substantive thrashing uh by the  storm titans not knights titans who we
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5397760,5403679,got here boys pong are out  big out  daniel sci feedy and brad mcbester in
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5403679,5410159,the reserves though kemp i don't know if  you knew that but they are  feda returns from injury i'm not sure if  you're aware of that he's on the uh he's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5410159,5416960,on the bench he's at 17 jersey anyone  else listed on the reserves ed yeah  proctor and thompson are also listed  among the reserves so with that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5416960,5422639,information knowing what we now know  i think we can safely say that this is
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5422639,5427840,going to be  a pile of poo yeah it's going to be a  pile
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5427840,5434320,yeah i'm just i don't know about this  guy  this thing's an outhouse  this is outhouse footage this is our
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5434320,5439760,house this is a drop hole this is drop  hole right yeah this is drop our rugby  leg this is this is try not to sit on
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5439760,5445440,the seat see if you can if you've got  the quad strength to just sort of brace  over the bowl and do that otherwise you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5445440,5450880,need to lay some toilet paper down  because think it's [ __ ] gross  holy [ __ ] yeah who do you reckon wins
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5450880,5457440,this poo fight i think titans titans  sling them well it's about it's about  who can throw the most poo and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5457440,5464159,david fafeta's got you know  you've got poo throwing in him like  strong are you gonna get a fair bit more
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5464159,5470719,back over the fence i think you'll score  a try just quietly  titans will win in a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5470719,5476159,a dull affair ponger is like a really  hot high quality piece of poo so like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5476159,5482320,the fact that he's out  is not good look i think bo firmer going  into camp match both him are going in
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5482320,5490000,the camp that'll make him confident with  the poo slinging i think if him has got  a fair poo sling in here was firmer in  camp yeah with queensland
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5490000,5496400,yeah do you reckon that's like helped  you slinging yeah i reckon the boys got  to him and said look in a poo slinging  in a match does that get the job done
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5496400,5502320,who's the best swing you've ever seen oh  [ __ ] up close up close
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5502400,5508080,um  mate that's a tough one best poo slinger
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5508080,5514400,look  i honestly don't know i couldn't tell  you there's been a fair few persons  myself included when it's a gritty
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5514400,5519280,shitty poo slinging game who's who
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5525280,5531280,top singer all the time but i've sung a  little more time in some pretty poor  outings by both teams
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5531280,5536880,all right including myself  yeah the blake did scores the  four-pointer to win the game four-nil
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5536880,5542639,that's a person in the 16th he's the  king of the poo slingers yeah  the person king
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5542639,5550159,campy  self-appointed yeah self-annoying  um look i think oh man this is a really
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5550159,5558209,it's actually a really tough one i think  titans get the job done seems like you  made that decision pretty easily  [Music]
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5558239,5564719,panthers vs roosters origin stars are  backing up for panthers toruva is on the  extended bench kiri rested again radley
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5564719,5570000,returns origin starts to back up for  roosters including collins who suffered  a head knock how do you see this match  going
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5570000,5577600,are we  and i i wish all the best for luke kiri  i worry though about these head knocks
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5577600,5582639,hundred percent absolutely he's had many  many head knocks now many many i um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5582639,5588560,i would i just want him to do whatever  is best for him like i don't know  whether it's a concern or it's not a  concern in his life but if it is like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5588560,5594400,there's so much more after footy like  roosters have a good track record of  handling it right so i'm sure they're  doing whatever it is yeah like good
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5594400,5600960,point they also they always talk about  like i think boyd even said when he was  going through it like he actually didn't  [ __ ] enjoy everyone talking about
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5600960,5606560,like it sort of made it harder to deal  with so i'm always a bit like whatever  bro you take your time
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5606560,5612239,do what you need to do i like that all  the panthers origin stars are backing up  you assume it's just going to be a bit
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5612239,5618159,of a humping  i think that right radley returning is  good for the roosters  but i just the roosters aren't that good
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5618159,5624320,so i see a bit of a hump  do you think like a panthers let's say  they go into another grand final or you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5624320,5630480,know they win a premiership back to back  or whatever like are they getting into  the territory of one of the most  dominant sides of the modern era rugby
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5630480,5636320,league yes they'd go very closely it's  like manly decade dominance storm
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5636320,5642159,they're [ __ ] good mate that's what i  mean like i know they haven't had the  longevity good but they are humping  teams interesting
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5642159,5648400,i think it's all secular yeah it's not  they don't have longevity but it's just  like they're  two seasons or three seasons yeah just
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5648400,5654159,[ __ ] utter dominance like the  dominance i cannot see the roosters  hanging with them for 80 minutes like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5654159,5660639,maybe the first 20 they'll have a crack  and then i just think the gaps will open  up and they'll fall away i just i just  can't see it any other way and the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5660639,5667280,roosters  i bought in at the start of the season i  would listen every week
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5667280,5672560,to maddie johns and cooper cronk shoot  the [ __ ] and now they've stopped back
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5672560,5678000,there's a [ __ ] there's a short ball  from the gods baby there's a short ball  from the gods and yeah you're saying no
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5678000,5684400,to it doesn't make any [ __ ] sense to  me bring it back but he would always  talk about the roosters and turn things  around and it's you know we used to turn
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5684400,5689679,things around ran five or six or ten or  whatever it hasn't happened and i'm now
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5689679,5695040,off  the the train i'm off the roosters train  of them turning around i don't think
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5695040,5701119,they will no they're [ __ ]  thank you tom  what happens when what happens like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5701119,5706960,roosters when they make the eight and  mainly don't they won't man  so what's gonna happen is roosters are
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5706960,5714000,already out of the eight yeah we were  supposed to be in the eight albeit for a  curse  that's by the by dragons fall out
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5714000,5720480,obviously manly go in  and manly finish  and slip streams sort of work so we are
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5720480,5727920,behind the roosters now but as they are  coming down where then we start to pull  out to the side and we start to get into
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5727920,5734080,our work yeah engage the legs what's the  uh what's i guess what's your response  to there's been a lot of calls that you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5734080,5740800,are actually responsible for the cursed  thoughts well they tried to say that  with new south wales as well and we came  and humped your 13 plus so i think
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5740800,5747600,that's just losers who don't get rugby  league and i mean that respectfully  losers will always be losers okay so
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5747600,5753600,losers lose  so winners win who's responsible for the  curse then  uh listen it's the black jersey we know
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5753600,5760880,that let's not forget what tom and i did  for the club last year dan if i may  remind you four losses on the trot no
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5760880,5766639,one believed not a man in the country  believed even the players were starting  to
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5766639,5772880,unbelieve  we got them believing again yeah  turbo goes on the great run of all time
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5772880,5779760,wins the dally m in a [ __ ] canter  with like the least amount of games ever  played we are a refereeing decision away
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5779760,5785600,from making the grand fall and i think  if we get there winning the ring that's  all the back off the back of us yeah so
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5785600,5790880,come in here after a couple of tough  losses and try to [ __ ] hate this  curse you don't know because i'm not
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5790880,5796800,here for it okay i think somebody's at  the club than tom and i just the punter  and the dribbler have been that it's  getting louder yeah but they're not
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5796800,5803360,manly fans or saying that i tell you  okay it's [ __ ] dribblers who don't  get their rugby league football lonely  fans manly fans like will come up to us

-E9x0fPVsPQ,5919920,5926560,something like that you should um  photoshop you  in bondi where they've got the uh all  the captains of the roosters painted on
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5926560,5932159,that wall it's like there should be  something of all the great demonians and  it's just like all those guys and then  you just in there

-E9x0fPVsPQ,5956000,5961199,of energy young hot boy  um  yeah we were saying lit up corey allen
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5961199,5967360,like lit up an older boy after a game  was it true was it not like on the field  where it was like they were having a bit
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5967360,5973520,of uh like just terse words where you're  like oh okay they both put up posts  saying it wasn't true i thought the  thing that wasn't true was like the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5973520,5979760,[ __ ] of them like being in the sheds  and like having to be separated and  stuff or from the training yeah i  thought it was like after the game you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5979760,5985040,know sometimes after the game everyone's  [ __ ] stoked  or like not stoked after a loss people
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5985040,5990880,aren't like so sad  yeah  it's interesting though like just like  making a story up like they blew up at
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5990880,5996880,each other in the dressing rooms and  it's like they're both like no he didn't  what the hell um yeah but i mean i also  if i'm playing
-E9x0fPVsPQ,5996880,6003040,mayo advocate yeah wicket advocate for  the advocate for the mayor yeah which  you know whilst we can laugh at mayo and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6003040,6009679,sniff it when it's a bit off  it's mayo essential to rugby league yeah  and if i'm playing advocate for mayor
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6009679,6015440,you are i  would you have a chicken sandwich  without me but i could say i could have  made rugby league is a chicken sandwich
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6015440,6021600,but i could make the argument right that  of course you're gonna come out and deny  that  because why wouldn't you yeah but then  it's just kind of like well [ __ ] you can
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6021600,6027520,say anything and then say yeah of course  you deny that it's like you know tom has  a [ __ ] fourth leg and you go no i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6027520,6032800,don't like yeah of course you'd say that  well yes and no if there's like in rugby  like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6032800,6038719,smoke there's fire sometimes of course  you'd say that  why  because you would say that but i've got
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6038719,6043760,no that doesn't cause you're trying to  prove your point you're trying to defend  yourself of course you'd say that well  no i've got no skin in the game so it's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6043760,6049520,not like i would be i don't care if i've  got to go or not but he's but he's he  goes about fourth leg i could be proud
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6049520,6055440,of that fourth leg that's what i'm  saying but if i'm saying i don't have it  then it wouldn't have anything to do  with ego but you what i'm saying is is
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6055440,6060800,like you could any time you say  this claim and the person says no
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6060800,6067440,yeah they have to say that do you think  that it was completely made up like if  you look at the buzz  that pokey scene with the tigers right
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6067440,6073520,the story was true but they lied about  the time that they were there  i'm not and i'm again this is an i am
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6073520,6078880,devil's advocate for mayo but if he's  saying that a blower they didn't deny  that though right well then what's the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6078880,6084400,[ __ ] what's the mayor  they had a blower you brought the  but you're saying that in tonight i'm
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6084400,6091360,saying if they didn't deny what's that  what was the mayo part that they i  thought like they had a disagreement and  it's all good no no the pokeys one like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6091360,6096800,that's a different situation because the  players didn't come out and deny it this  time the players both put screenshots
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6096800,6103520,and shorts up and said this never  happened  like why would they need to even defend  it like if if if you did like you know
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6103520,6109040,get a bit heated in the changing room  like i just think it's it's strange how  we're just so quick to be like oh that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6109040,6114080,of course they'd say that when it's like  well then you're just putting players in  a position where anytime they deny
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6114080,6120239,anything you just go yeah of course i'd  say and you just don't believe them  that's that's who's more close to the  truth devil's advocate for mayo comes in
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6120239,6126719,i'm not saying they did it they didn't  but i'm saying put it this way when  you're advocating who's more likely to  tell the lie
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6126719,6132960,i think it would depend like if you if  they had a real set to then  i think that there's every chance that  you would lie but like how many times
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6132960,6140159,have we seen the media make things up  how many times have you seen  a player like make things up yeah the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6140159,6146960,media is more likely it's more likely  than me  yeah so like just automatically yeah  well of course of course you know of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6146960,6153840,course they deny it that that just puts  you in a position where you can say  anything about anyone and then they deny  you go of course you did not
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6153840,6159600,completely  but i'm just saying it's like a no-win  situation it isn't a it is a no-win  situation
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6159600,6165760,that's the the nature of the beast  though isn't it well that's the beauty  of mayo  because you'd say something new tonight  and yeah well you would [ __ ] are you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6165760,6171040,following along at home  are you getting this the depths of mayo
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6171040,6176400,it's a lose-lose situation it's curly  down it is interesting though because  like what happens is if they write a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6176400,6181520,story and i've spoken to some people  that like have been  had big profiles in sport and you're
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6181520,6187280,always in this hard position between  let's say they write a story that's  completely false if you respond to that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6187280,6193199,story then they write a story about you  responding the story and now all of a  sudden you're in their
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6193199,6198639,world  of creating content that they want  you're in the machine well you ate the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6198639,6205119,honey you ate the honey but it but if  you don't say like if you don't say  anything then whatever they say people
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6205119,6211600,just believe it you know so there's a  bunch of people out there right now that  think  uh kiraz and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6211600,6217679,alan had a bloody  at each other in the changing room  there's a bunch of people that just  believe that now and it's just this
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6217679,6224080,weird cycle like do you come out and  deny it because then you get people like  tom going he would say that  or well i mean i'm advocating for mayor
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6224080,6229679,i've touched this i'm joking to the  situation i'm joking you're gonna  advocate what would you do in that  situation seriously and i'm not taking
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6229679,6235679,the piss i'd [ __ ] say if it was  [ __ ] i'd say it was [ __ ] as well  but some people don't say that some  people would turn the other check and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6235679,6241520,say nothing i'd be like [ __ ] off i  didn't say that what would you say  in a situation where it's a false story
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6241520,6248080,would you just be like i'm just gonna  let it go not feed the beast would you  feed the beast  mate honestly i it depends what the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6248080,6253920,allegations were  true like if it was [ __ ] it was  something like whatever i just go ignore  it because i'll move on to something
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6253920,6260159,else and people forget yeah they've  people forget like that yeah like there  would have been a million things that  had happened all these players in the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6260159,6266000,past that you just forgotten about you  just keep your [ __ ] mouth shut keep  your head down maddie what would you do
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6266000,6275000,i'd be one of those people that  immediately bites back on emotion and  then regrets it about that i want you to  do that yeah that's what i'll do
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6275040,6281199,people forget about [ __ ] like that yeah  oh for sure  i um i'm of the mind
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6281199,6286560,unless it's like an outrageous one  that's like smashing your character you  just you just gotta not say anything
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6286560,6291679,because it's just unless it's outrageous  yeah the less it's like i also can  completely like i can respect someone
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6291679,6296800,going you know what [ __ ] it if it's  still in the news cycle like i don't  give a [ __ ] if someone's talking about  you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6296800,6302000,true it's like no dude [ __ ] you i'm  going to talk about it  there's a difference between making
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6302000,6308239,yourself feel better and what would be  effective  because like talking about it's not a  thing  well it depends what your end goal is
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6308239,6315040,right if your end goal is i want people  to stop talking about me then just don't  say anything but if yours is i don't  want everyone to think that of me then
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6315040,6321199,say it or i don't want this person to  get away with just talking [ __ ]  and they
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6321199,6327679,won't they want that so perfect that's  fine though  you're actually doing what they want  well you're doing what you want but like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6327679,6332960,if you're able to at least cast doubt  upon them as a like them as a journalist
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6332960,6339600,or like whatever you like  again this is how i would  probably operate shockingly i'd be like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6339600,6346000,i don't care if i'm playing into your  hands you're a [ __ ] liar and i'd  probably be like more aggressive we  didn't do it a perfect example is the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6346000,6351840,george williams situation  you know when he they came out and was  like he was agitating for a release or
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6351840,6357119,whatever and he came out and denied it  it made the story way bigger and then  all of a sudden they're on bateman as
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6357119,6362239,well and bateman as well and all of a  sudden they're on 360 going like here's  a picture of him smiling yeah yeah yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6362239,6367520,you know what i'm saying yeah and so the  the tough thing is it's like there it  also ended up being true though
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6367520,6373440,what they both were trying to get out of  their contracts not no not not it was  hard
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6373440,6378639,it's half true it was absolutely not  true what they were saying and they  changed their language specifics of what
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6378639,6385679,they were saying sure but they did still  like both want to get out of their  clients no not really not really so the  situation wasn't there wasn't the um
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6385679,6391520,wasn't the george williams one was that  he just wanted to go home at the end of  the season or something and then come  back
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6391520,6396560,he wanted to keep playing he was willing  to keep playing that's what it was but  his missus had a kid and they were stuck
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6396560,6401760,in australia  um and so he was in this tough sport of  like going to them early on in the year
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6401760,6407920,and saying my missus has a kid like  we're about to have a kid  give me time i'll give you time to find
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6407920,6413119,someone i'm telling you early but then  the the article was basically like he's  going in agitating for a release he's
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6413119,6418320,going to sign for somewhere in queens  like new south wales like other enteral  clubs in the bateman situation he wanted
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6418320,6424800,to resign with the raiders and he went  to the raiders and said like you know i  want to sign they said we don't have  enough cap space for what you want so
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6424800,6429920,basically you're free to negotiate  elsewhere so it wasn't here them just  coming in and going
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6429920,6436000,give me a [ __ ] release i'm out of  here like it was it was much more  nuanced than that  it always is but the tough thing is is
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6436000,6443199,like for example george williams  situation even if he comes out and  denies it there is still a large swath  of people that say and i'm not having a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6443199,6448480,correct yeah that literally just say of  course you'd say that you're a liar you  you did ask for a release i mean even
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6448480,6453679,you guys right now you felt like well  they kind of were asking for you know  we're asking for a release that's the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6453679,6459040,reality wasn't asking for george  williams was george williams yeah but  i'm not saying that his reasons aren't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6459040,6464400,completely legitimate they are they're  completely fine but he was asking for a  release but the context of the the way
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6464400,6469679,he was asking for release  very different to him agitating for a  release to go to another nrl club
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6469679,6475679,completely so so like i get i get all of  that and the way that it's written about  is [ __ ] right so if i'm george
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6475679,6480800,williams i go  this is why i want to release and this  is what it is again i'm not telling any
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6480800,6486159,like i've never been in the situation of  being a player and having media scrutiny  but if i'm just thinking about how i'd  react if if so if i'm being
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6486159,6492000,misrepresented in the media  then like and you've got people so like  there's an element of truth that you're
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6492000,6498400,asking for a release and ultimately when  you do get a release that's going to be  the thing that people remember but if
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6498400,6505199,there's a real if there's a much more  legitimate reason i completely can be  like i would be just like i'd say it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6505199,6510239,the tough as i said the tough thing is  is that if you say something there's  still going to be a large group of
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6510239,6516239,people that just focus on this one bit  of information and all believe the  journal because they want to believe the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6516239,6522719,journal they want to believe like you  can't describe those people well that's  that's why you would be against coming  out and saying something because no
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6522719,6528880,matter what you say even if you're  telling 100 the truth there's going to  be a group of people that just don't  believe you and say
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6528880,6534560,the rest of the [ __ ] there's that  group of people who are never going to  believe you no matter what you say and  then there's everyone else yeah for sure
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6534560,6540880,but again  you create more of a fire  now more people remember the george  williams situation because of that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6540880,6547119,because it was so big whereas if he  didn't come out and say anything and i  again i don't know what i would do  whether i would say i wouldn't say but
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6547119,6552639,that the story would be smaller wouldn't  be as big wouldn't be as dramatic it's  the only pretty big only
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6552639,6559280,the only line of it you're hearing is  agitating for release [ __ ] baitman  agitating for release this that so  you're only allowing it whilst it may
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6559280,6565760,not be as big you're allowing the  narrative to be dictated by people who  aren't representing you fairly so like  the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6565760,6571920,obviously you're weighing up do i want  to get [ __ ] do i want this thing to  be like a bigger story uh but at least i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6571920,6578000,am  letting people know the actual truth of  the matter or do i just go [ __ ] it this  is this potentially is gonna look bad on
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6578000,6585040,my character and i'm just gonna say  nothing it's horse for courses i think  yeah yeah because like the george  williams thing it was almost made it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6585040,6590480,worse but was nathan brown when he was  like i'm not gonna go back to the  warriors  yeah and then originally everyone's like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6590480,6595679,what the [ __ ] but then you come out and  explain it you're like oh yeah okay  really reasonable [ __ ] reason not to
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6595679,6601920,you know what i mean yeah a hundred  percent  it really is a bit of both yeah  unfortunately um i think in your moment
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6601920,6607440,like the i think the tough thing for  players is like this  it feels like some journals have a quite
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6607440,6612960,adverse  uh adversarial adversarial adversarial  relationship with players like it's kind
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6612960,6619599,of us versus them whereas i feel like a  guy like nathan brown that's been in the  media a little bit  has the connection to be able to like
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6619599,6626400,have a fair well he went on threes did  he go on 360. the 90s that night yeah  yeah and i just think that i don't think
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6626400,6632880,the players would be given that platform  sometimes yeah or if they were given  that platform they'd be getting yelled  at like literally they yelled out then
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6632880,6639840,when um  the rugby league player association went  on there and he was like that was
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6650960,6657040,um but yeah it's a tough situation i  don't know what the right answer is to  it i really really don't like there's  been so many players that have had
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6657040,6662080,certain narratives ran about them and  then when you speak to them privately  you're like [ __ ] and they're like but  there's no point in me coming out
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6662080,6667360,because  then i just get smashed by all like all  these other things get brought up and
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6667360,6673840,and and it just gets worse so yeah i  don't know what the [ __ ] right answer  is it's a tough one um cowboys v roncos
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6673840,6679360,cows  like today boo  reynolds returns to debut so when did
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6679360,6685599,they because i thought when that whole  thing was  like the deal hadn't been signed you  know i i must have completely missed it
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6685599,6693520,yeah it got it got sorted  um  yeah i think probably the cowboys but i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6693520,6699679,like combo for two because reynolds is  back cows at home  [ __ ] playing good footy
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6699679,6704880,what kind of [ __ ]  cows are playing a dollar fifty
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6704880,6710480,plane or is he well he's named but oh  man i'm getting to the point with  payment like mate you're too tough  you're on good just like i'm a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6710480,6716560,restaurant i have a week off bro you've  earned it jesus christ you've got two ac  joints two yc's and you've been in a
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6716560,6722400,moon boot talk about tough man  he's got to be like one of the most  mentally tough players in the nrl right
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6722400,6729679,now even when he like goes through  ramadan i apologize if i'm getting uh  pronouncing that wrong  um where he doesn't
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6729679,6735360,eat between  sun and sun down and he just has water  and he plays no i don't think you can
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6735360,6740719,have oh can you just have water is that  what i think you can just have water  i don't know  really
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6740719,6745840,could you please google that because i  thought it was like those things where  like hazam and sunny were playing was  like they can't even have water on the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6745840,6751760,field oh yeah you know how mentally  tough you gotta be to do that i feel  like you can't like i'm not mentally
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6751760,6757760,touched for that yeah you're right  you're kind of anything  not water
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6757760,6765840,can you make an exception if you like  are there exceptions or  uh i'm sure
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6766080,6771440,no i mean like if you're a  life-threatening session at work or like  if you're playing footy no no like dude
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6771440,6777679,hasn't played i remember has him playing  some game on like a hot [ __ ] day and  he was and the whole i you know how much
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6777679,6783199,i respect that [ __ ] when i see like  people  like for has to do that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6783199,6789599,the mental fortitude is just like on  another level seriously crazy as a young  man as well uh and dedication to
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6789599,6795119,something bigger than yourself i admire  that [ __ ] um cowboys to broncos uh i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6795119,6801199,think broncos one to twelve i think it's  gonna be a cracking match usually like  in our heyday we always had close
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6801199,6806400,matches broncos cowboys um as in not my  day but like i very much enjoyed that
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6806400,6811760,period of time like youtube  [ __ ] went back and forth field  goal after field goal obviously the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6811760,6819040,cowboys steal the premiership out of  your jaws  with a defensive lapse um similarly when
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6819040,6824239,val holmes um scored against you guys on  the buzzer not as much on the line  thankfully but yeah obviously it was
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6824239,6829840,tough similar though like similar-ish  you know yeah  your guy dropped the ball
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6829840,6837040,moments big moments yeah but like i'm  talking about when you like literally  lost the premiership when it was like  home and hosed and the siren went yeah
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6837040,6842960,and the ball is still alive because no  one wanted to make a tackle  and then michael morgan just goes oh can  i just stroll through here bam bang
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6842960,6848159,flick passes  yeah um so it's like a bit similar to  the home situation where you're no i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6848159,6854639,don't know  okay i do  like the fixture though i do like the  fixture i'm gonna go cowboys versus the
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6854639,6860000,bronx you like the concept i'm going bro  i like johnson's concept i love the  concept you like the concept north first
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6860000,6865199,south love it yeah it's classic yeah  classic stuff i think broncos get it  done
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6865199,6870400,did you guys watch peaky blinders last  season never seen it you've never  watched peaky blinders i've been up to

-E9x0fPVsPQ,6965679,6970719,but i just can't trust south so whilst i  hate the eels
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6970719,6976159,hate can be  trumped  by a lack of trust
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6976159,6983040,and so i'm saying the eels win this one  yep  south are hard to trust i'm with you
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6983040,6989480,shout outs are really hard to trust yeah  dude  there's just something about big bad
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6989840,6996800,south though got that that that game  against the dragons i don't trust you  but you could argue you could argue
-E9x0fPVsPQ,6996800,7002719,that the yields perform well against  incitations good sides and poorly
-E9x0fPVsPQ,7002719,7009679,against [ __ ] sides  now you could argue that after south's  performance against dragons they sleep  into a [ __ ] team category
-E9x0fPVsPQ,7009679,7016560,the yields  you could make that argument i'd say a  south with latrell coming back a better  team category they've got good players
-E9x0fPVsPQ,7016560,7021840,south have good players and whilst  don't ask jason demetrio this but i
-E9x0fPVsPQ,7021840,7028000,reckon he might he might say at least  you know in his nightmares that they  miss adam reynolds they're still a good
