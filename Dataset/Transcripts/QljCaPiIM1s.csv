QljCaPiIM1s,80,1439,welcome to another edition of the
QljCaPiIM1s,1439,3600,gridiron report i'm jerry johnson and
QljCaPiIM1s,3600,5279,you know we're in the we're in summer
QljCaPiIM1s,5279,6399,now
QljCaPiIM1s,6399,8000,off season
QljCaPiIM1s,8000,10559,no texas tech sports no the major sports
QljCaPiIM1s,10559,12240,are in season
QljCaPiIM1s,12240,14960,and you know a lot of the talk has
QljCaPiIM1s,14960,16400,turned to of course recruiting's going
QljCaPiIM1s,16400,17600,on we have
QljCaPiIM1s,17600,19439,plenty of that for you but
QljCaPiIM1s,19439,21199,also you know the upcoming season
QljCaPiIM1s,21199,23279,looking at the schedule as a whole and
QljCaPiIM1s,23279,26240,uh you know the esp and fpi those kind
QljCaPiIM1s,26240,30160,of things um the vegas over under for
QljCaPiIM1s,30160,32558,texas tech's season win total and you
QljCaPiIM1s,32558,34480,know i thought this would be a perfect
QljCaPiIM1s,34480,36239,time to just break down the schedule and
QljCaPiIM1s,36239,38480,give my thoughts and this is still for
QljCaPiIM1s,38480,40559,me i feel like it's a little early even
QljCaPiIM1s,40559,43200,though we're under 70 days
QljCaPiIM1s,43200,46160,from the kickoff of the joey mcguire era
QljCaPiIM1s,46160,49280,texas tech's 2022 season i'm gonna get
QljCaPiIM1s,49280,50960,to the schedule
QljCaPiIM1s,50960,54239,all that but uh the last over under i
QljCaPiIM1s,54239,56800,saw or like the
QljCaPiIM1s,56800,59520,from vegas was five and a half uh in
QljCaPiIM1s,59520,61680,terms of season one regular season win
QljCaPiIM1s,61680,63440,totals and you know i think that's
QljCaPiIM1s,63440,64960,pretty good you know vegas usually gets
QljCaPiIM1s,64960,66720,this kind of the stuff right
QljCaPiIM1s,66720,68640,um now a lot of people but whoa what
QljCaPiIM1s,68640,69840,about all this excitement with joe
QljCaPiIM1s,69840,71439,mcguire now that you know they may not
QljCaPiIM1s,71439,73439,go to a ball well part of that is
QljCaPiIM1s,73439,76320,because of this difficult schedule
QljCaPiIM1s,76320,78720,the big 12 is expected to be tough in
QljCaPiIM1s,78720,80479,terms of
QljCaPiIM1s,80479,81840,you know it's going to be a pretty much
QljCaPiIM1s,81840,83200,even playing field there's going to be a
QljCaPiIM1s,83200,84320,lot of
QljCaPiIM1s,84320,86320,good teams maybe not great teams you
QljCaPiIM1s,86320,90640,know oklahoma perhaps of course uh but
QljCaPiIM1s,90640,91840,other than that
QljCaPiIM1s,91840,95439,um you know good to really good teams um
QljCaPiIM1s,95439,97200,in this conference and then texas texas
QljCaPiIM1s,97200,99280,non-conference is just tough so
QljCaPiIM1s,99280,101920,i i think i actually do think texas tech
QljCaPiIM1s,101920,104320,will be a little better overall as a
QljCaPiIM1s,104320,105600,team this year
QljCaPiIM1s,105600,107680,uh last year they won seven games
QljCaPiIM1s,107680,109520,counting the the bowl game you know
QljCaPiIM1s,109520,111360,finished seven and six beat mississippi
QljCaPiIM1s,111360,114079,state in liberty bowl crush mississippi
QljCaPiIM1s,114079,116560,state by the way um but
QljCaPiIM1s,116560,118960,this schedule is much tougher so i i
QljCaPiIM1s,118960,121840,feel like if if tech can just go to
QljCaPiIM1s,121840,123759,another bowl game and keep that going
QljCaPiIM1s,123759,125439,it'll be a strong foundation and then
QljCaPiIM1s,125439,128479,after that i think expectations start to
QljCaPiIM1s,128479,130959,to raise a little bit um joey maguire is
QljCaPiIM1s,130959,132480,recruiting like create him and his staff
QljCaPiIM1s,132480,135520,recruiting like crazy so at some point
QljCaPiIM1s,135520,138239,definitely by 2024 it's like okay we're
QljCaPiIM1s,138239,140239,you know it needs to be eight eight wins
QljCaPiIM1s,140239,141760,is what we're thinking about but right
QljCaPiIM1s,141760,143760,now just get back to a bowl game so
QljCaPiIM1s,143760,145760,let's see you know if the red raiders
QljCaPiIM1s,145760,147040,can do that let's just break down the
QljCaPiIM1s,147040,149280,schedule first off they open up the
QljCaPiIM1s,149280,151599,season september 3rd at the jones at
QljCaPiIM1s,151599,154640,home in lubbock 7 p.m against murray
QljCaPiIM1s,154640,157040,state now you know i'm not going to give
QljCaPiIM1s,157040,158959,a lot of analysis for this and i hope i
QljCaPiIM1s,158959,160640,don't regret this but if tech doesn't
QljCaPiIM1s,160640,162160,beat murray state at home to open up the
QljCaPiIM1s,162160,163440,season then what are we even talking
QljCaPiIM1s,163440,165280,about so that should be a win then the
QljCaPiIM1s,165280,167760,red raiders host houston of course tech
QljCaPiIM1s,167760,169440,beat houston to open the season last
QljCaPiIM1s,169440,171120,year i believe the red raiders have won
QljCaPiIM1s,171120,173920,the four last match-ups uh
QljCaPiIM1s,173920,175680,you know so tech has really dominated
QljCaPiIM1s,175680,178080,the series as of late overall uh
QljCaPiIM1s,178080,180560,houston's had an advantage but uh you
QljCaPiIM1s,180560,181760,know
QljCaPiIM1s,181760,183760,tech is really taking care of houston
QljCaPiIM1s,183760,184959,and you know houston's had some good
QljCaPiIM1s,184959,186480,teams they've beaten oklahoma a couple
QljCaPiIM1s,186480,189519,of times in the last one decade or so um
QljCaPiIM1s,189519,191200,but and they had a good year last year
QljCaPiIM1s,191200,193280,after playing texas tech but and they're
QljCaPiIM1s,193280,195680,expected to be good again this year but
QljCaPiIM1s,195680,197680,red raiders at home against houston i
QljCaPiIM1s,197680,199280,personally think they should win that do
QljCaPiIM1s,199280,201360,i am i counting as a win no houston
QljCaPiIM1s,201360,203200,could beat tech in lubbock i believe
QljCaPiIM1s,203200,204319,that but i
QljCaPiIM1s,204319,205360,for me
QljCaPiIM1s,205360,206640,uh
QljCaPiIM1s,206640,208959,have somewhat of a handle on both teams
QljCaPiIM1s,208959,210799,i think tech should beat houston at home
QljCaPiIM1s,210799,213040,so 2-0 start looking good
QljCaPiIM1s,213040,214640,it gets really tough here the red
QljCaPiIM1s,214640,217920,raiders go to nc state this is uh
QljCaPiIM1s,217920,219840,saturday september 17th but oh by the
QljCaPiIM1s,219840,222080,way the first six games are consecutive
QljCaPiIM1s,222080,223920,saturdays in a row
QljCaPiIM1s,223920,225440,tech doesn't have a bye week until
QljCaPiIM1s,225440,227440,midway through the season
QljCaPiIM1s,227440,228400,so
QljCaPiIM1s,228400,231120,bam bam bam september 3rd murray state
QljCaPiIM1s,231120,233280,september 10th houston and then at nc
QljCaPiIM1s,233280,235680,state on the 17th and that one's
QljCaPiIM1s,235680,238640,scheduled to be on espn2 that's a 6 p.m
QljCaPiIM1s,238640,240640,game so it's a night game
QljCaPiIM1s,240640,242400,nc state's expect to have one of its
QljCaPiIM1s,242400,245040,better teams in the past couple decades
QljCaPiIM1s,245040,247920,um and they're known as a tough place to
QljCaPiIM1s,247920,248720,play
QljCaPiIM1s,248720,251920,so you know this is a tough game i i
QljCaPiIM1s,251920,253840,to me i mean you look at this as a loss
QljCaPiIM1s,253840,255200,for texas tech
QljCaPiIM1s,255200,257120,we'll have to see college football is a
QljCaPiIM1s,257120,258959,crazy sport anything can happen maybe
QljCaPiIM1s,258959,260560,they lose to houston then go and shock
QljCaPiIM1s,260560,262400,nc state they're on the road those kind
QljCaPiIM1s,262400,263840,of things happen in a college football
QljCaPiIM1s,263840,265919,season but i'm giving them a two on one
QljCaPiIM1s,265919,268720,start uh you know in in non-conference
QljCaPiIM1s,268720,271600,then they open up big 12 play at home uh
QljCaPiIM1s,271600,273919,against texas and
QljCaPiIM1s,273919,274880,look
QljCaPiIM1s,274880,276800,there's a couple of things with texas in
QljCaPiIM1s,276800,279440,in terms of where texas tech is
QljCaPiIM1s,279440,282400,uh for one i know a lot of people are
QljCaPiIM1s,282400,284080,are predicting texas to win the big 12
QljCaPiIM1s,284080,286320,and i just don't see that um
QljCaPiIM1s,286320,288639,maybe they win seven or eight games
QljCaPiIM1s,288639,290720,they have a good team of course texas
QljCaPiIM1s,290720,292560,they recruit well although i think some
QljCaPiIM1s,292560,293840,of those recruiting rankings are way
QljCaPiIM1s,293840,296560,overrated um with texas just because a
QljCaPiIM1s,296560,298560,lot of these guys get bumps after uh
QljCaPiIM1s,298560,301360,texas is in on a big it's just kind of a
QljCaPiIM1s,301360,303280,thing with recruiting rankings and it
QljCaPiIM1s,303280,305120,seems like texas is always overrated
QljCaPiIM1s,305120,306800,going into the season and then they you
QljCaPiIM1s,306800,309039,know they let their fans down
QljCaPiIM1s,309039,311280,but on the other hand even bad texas
QljCaPiIM1s,311280,313360,teams including last year that team
QljCaPiIM1s,313360,314639,crushed tech
QljCaPiIM1s,314639,316960,in uh austin i mean tech couldn't stop
QljCaPiIM1s,316960,318800,them and that team didn't even go to a
QljCaPiIM1s,318800,320400,bowl game so
QljCaPiIM1s,320400,322160,you know that's where we are with this
QljCaPiIM1s,322160,324400,to me even though it's at home
QljCaPiIM1s,324400,325790,i gotta say uh
QljCaPiIM1s,325790,326960,[Music]
QljCaPiIM1s,326960,328800,i gotta say texas probably wins that
QljCaPiIM1s,328800,331520,game just based on on recent history uh
QljCaPiIM1s,331520,333360,kansas state speaking of recent history
QljCaPiIM1s,333360,334240,man
QljCaPiIM1s,334240,336080,right after playing texas they go to
QljCaPiIM1s,336080,338800,kansas state and kansas state has a
QljCaPiIM1s,338800,340639,solid team that's what kansas state is
QljCaPiIM1s,340639,343440,saw a program uh chris klein has done a
QljCaPiIM1s,343440,344960,really good job of keeping that their
QljCaPiIM1s,344960,346800,identity at kansas state and you know
QljCaPiIM1s,346800,349039,even when kane the state isn't good
QljCaPiIM1s,349039,350800,they've handled uh tech they've beaten
QljCaPiIM1s,350800,352560,tech i don't remember i don't
QljCaPiIM1s,352560,354800,have it down but it's been several years
QljCaPiIM1s,354800,357680,in a row i think 2015 was the last time
QljCaPiIM1s,357680,358880,uh tech
QljCaPiIM1s,358880,361440,beat kansas state that was when deandre
QljCaPiIM1s,361440,363199,washington was a first team all by 12
QljCaPiIM1s,363199,365360,running back ran for over 200 yards at
QljCaPiIM1s,365360,367680,home on senior day uh against the
QljCaPiIM1s,367680,369199,wildcats
QljCaPiIM1s,369199,371840,so kansas state has
QljCaPiIM1s,371840,373840,you know until tech can beat kansas
QljCaPiIM1s,373840,374880,state because there's been some bad
QljCaPiIM1s,374880,376240,kansas state teams including last year
QljCaPiIM1s,376240,378240,that b-tech uh
QljCaPiIM1s,378240,379680,they shut out texas tech in the second
QljCaPiIM1s,379680,382080,half in lubbock i i can't pick the red
QljCaPiIM1s,382080,383600,raiders to beat kansas state maybe joey
QljCaPiIM1s,383600,385759,mcguire and this team the these these
QljCaPiIM1s,385759,388560,players reverse that and in that lose
QljCaPiIM1s,388560,390479,the streak but i'm not prepared to to
QljCaPiIM1s,390479,392080,see that right now so
QljCaPiIM1s,392080,393520,that is a
QljCaPiIM1s,393520,395199,two and three star i have them on right
QljCaPiIM1s,395199,397199,now all right then at
QljCaPiIM1s,397199,399360,oklahoma state
QljCaPiIM1s,399360,400560,you know
QljCaPiIM1s,400560,402560,this looks like a loss oklahoma state's
QljCaPiIM1s,402560,404319,expect to be pretty good again
QljCaPiIM1s,404319,406560,um i mean it's what they are under mike
QljCaPiIM1s,406560,407680,gundy's they're good they're
QljCaPiIM1s,407680,410560,consistently good um and in stillwater's
QljCaPiIM1s,410560,412639,tough but tech has beaten oklahoma state
QljCaPiIM1s,412639,414560,in stillwater what three or four years
QljCaPiIM1s,414560,416720,ago um they've beaten oklahoma state
QljCaPiIM1s,416720,418720,twice and i think the last four matchups
QljCaPiIM1s,418720,420400,after the cowboys just dominated the
QljCaPiIM1s,420400,421919,series i think they won every game for
QljCaPiIM1s,421919,423520,like a decade or something but
QljCaPiIM1s,423520,425680,uh here recently
QljCaPiIM1s,425680,427440,texas tech has mixed it up with oklahoma
QljCaPiIM1s,427440,428639,state so
QljCaPiIM1s,428639,430639,you know i think there's a possibility
QljCaPiIM1s,430639,432319,let me put you this way between texas
QljCaPiIM1s,432319,434479,kansas state and oklahoma state i think
QljCaPiIM1s,434479,435360,they
QljCaPiIM1s,435360,436720,they find a way to win one of those
QljCaPiIM1s,436720,438800,games now which one of those games
QljCaPiIM1s,438800,441840,uh perhaps it's at oklahoma state which
QljCaPiIM1s,441840,443759,if i was vegas i would definitely have
QljCaPiIM1s,443759,445280,the cowboys favor going to that game
QljCaPiIM1s,445280,448479,knowing what i know in june but i just i
QljCaPiIM1s,448479,449680,feel like
QljCaPiIM1s,449680,452000,this team the veteran squad they showed
QljCaPiIM1s,452000,453680,some resiliency last year they beat some
QljCaPiIM1s,453680,456000,good teams last year i i think this
QljCaPiIM1s,456000,457759,squad will find a way to win one of
QljCaPiIM1s,457759,459840,those three games my guess is oklahoma
QljCaPiIM1s,459840,461360,state but we'll have to see
QljCaPiIM1s,461360,463680,all right then they get a bye finally in
QljCaPiIM1s,463680,465680,october they get their buy and then they
QljCaPiIM1s,465680,467280,host west virginia and tech has had a
QljCaPiIM1s,467280,468639,lot of success against west virginia
QljCaPiIM1s,468639,470879,it's in lubbock i'm chalking that up as
QljCaPiIM1s,470879,472800,a win so that's four and three through
QljCaPiIM1s,472800,474000,seven games
QljCaPiIM1s,474000,476240,versus baylor now the defending big 12
QljCaPiIM1s,476240,478720,champs very good program of course
QljCaPiIM1s,478720,480400,the coaching staffs are familiar with
QljCaPiIM1s,480400,482000,each other joel mcguire coming over from
QljCaPiIM1s,482000,483280,baylor bringing some guys over from
QljCaPiIM1s,483280,484479,baylor
QljCaPiIM1s,484479,486240,uh it's in waco
QljCaPiIM1s,486240,488960,this game has been close here recently
QljCaPiIM1s,488960,491120,i have to give it to the bears uh
QljCaPiIM1s,491120,493120,because it's in waco
QljCaPiIM1s,493120,496080,defending big 12 champs all right at tcu
QljCaPiIM1s,496080,497759,you know i don't know what to think
QljCaPiIM1s,497759,500000,obviously tcu has
QljCaPiIM1s,500000,503039,undergone a huge change here
QljCaPiIM1s,503039,506800,uh with with sonny dykes taking over um
QljCaPiIM1s,506800,508879,so for gary patterson there in fort
QljCaPiIM1s,508879,510800,worth we're going to see what that looks
QljCaPiIM1s,510800,512640,like it's in fort worth now tech has
QljCaPiIM1s,512640,514880,beaten tcu and fort worth here
QljCaPiIM1s,514880,517200,recently someone you know since tc's
QljCaPiIM1s,517200,519120,been the big 12 tech has had success in
QljCaPiIM1s,519120,522000,fort worth big fan river fan base in the
QljCaPiIM1s,522000,524000,metroplex of course so i expect a lot of
QljCaPiIM1s,524000,525440,tech fans to be there
QljCaPiIM1s,525440,527680,you know i'm not ready to say tech beats
QljCaPiIM1s,527680,529440,tcu in
QljCaPiIM1s,529440,531920,in fort worth but i think they could i
QljCaPiIM1s,531920,534320,really do so that's one to watch to me
QljCaPiIM1s,534320,536800,that's a coin toss game in as we stand
QljCaPiIM1s,536800,539279,in june but you know
QljCaPiIM1s,539279,540160,uh
QljCaPiIM1s,540160,541440,if you're a tcu fan you're probably
QljCaPiIM1s,541440,543120,saying oh we're gonna crush texas tech
QljCaPiIM1s,543120,544320,if you're texas tech you're probably
QljCaPiIM1s,544320,545920,saying hey we can go in there and beat
QljCaPiIM1s,545920,549440,tcu in in fort worth so i get it i get
QljCaPiIM1s,549440,551760,both sides of the argument i'm going to
QljCaPiIM1s,551760,553519,uh i'm going to say that's a win right
QljCaPiIM1s,553519,556000,now and that that gives tech uh five
QljCaPiIM1s,556000,558240,wins we have three more games to finish
QljCaPiIM1s,558240,559519,off the season
QljCaPiIM1s,559519,561040,uh
QljCaPiIM1s,561040,563360,versus kansas at home this is i mean
QljCaPiIM1s,563360,564640,obviously tech has to win this game you
QljCaPiIM1s,564640,566399,can't lose to kansas uh if you want to
QljCaPiIM1s,566399,568959,go back to a bowl with the schedule so i
QljCaPiIM1s,568959,570080,you know
QljCaPiIM1s,570080,572000,i do believe there's not a lot of
QljCaPiIM1s,572000,574399,analysis needed other than uh kansas's
QljCaPiIM1s,574399,575760,new coach had them competitive of course
QljCaPiIM1s,575760,578000,they beat texas last year they've shown
QljCaPiIM1s,578000,579920,some fight so it scares me a little bit
QljCaPiIM1s,579920,581200,i think kansas
QljCaPiIM1s,581200,583839,could beat tech but it's in lubbock so
QljCaPiIM1s,583839,585760,i'm going to go with the red raiders all
QljCaPiIM1s,585760,588160,right at iowa state of course texas tech
QljCaPiIM1s,588160,591440,finally beat iowa state last year um
QljCaPiIM1s,591440,594800,gary bay kicked that 62-yard field goal
QljCaPiIM1s,594800,596640,to at the end of the you know end of the
QljCaPiIM1s,596640,599360,game with the clock uh expiring for
QljCaPiIM1s,599360,601680,texas tech to upset iowa state and
QljCaPiIM1s,601680,603279,become bowl eligible it was a huge
QljCaPiIM1s,603279,605760,victory that was after iowa state had
QljCaPiIM1s,605760,607839,won every game against tech in the matt
QljCaPiIM1s,607839,609440,campbell era leading up to that in four
QljCaPiIM1s,609440,612240,or five years uh so that was that was a
QljCaPiIM1s,612240,615600,huge victory now it's back in ames
QljCaPiIM1s,615600,617360,iowa state's probably thinking about
QljCaPiIM1s,617360,619120,some revenge at least some of the guys
QljCaPiIM1s,619120,621440,on the team the coaching staff so
QljCaPiIM1s,621440,623040,i'm not saying tech's going to go into
QljCaPiIM1s,623040,624959,ames and beat iowa state this year um
QljCaPiIM1s,624959,626640,with with the cyclones having revenge on
QljCaPiIM1s,626640,628640,their minds so and they they packed that
QljCaPiIM1s,628640,630640,place that's a tough place to play so i
QljCaPiIM1s,630640,632160,think that's a loss so i have texas
QljCaPiIM1s,632160,634160,second six and five there and versus
QljCaPiIM1s,634160,635600,oklahoma and some people are picking
QljCaPiIM1s,635600,638480,tech to upset oklahoma uh this year i'm
QljCaPiIM1s,638480,640480,not saying it you know it won't happen
QljCaPiIM1s,640480,642959,because uh you know it's in lubbock and
QljCaPiIM1s,642959,644079,that helps
QljCaPiIM1s,644079,644959,but
QljCaPiIM1s,644959,647680,um just looking at it at face value i
QljCaPiIM1s,647680,649760,gotta say oklahoma wins they've they've
QljCaPiIM1s,649760,651920,dominated the whole big 12 for the most
QljCaPiIM1s,651920,653600,part um
QljCaPiIM1s,653600,655760,you know the latter part the better part
QljCaPiIM1s,655760,658480,of the last decade and uh
QljCaPiIM1s,658480,660480,i expect oklahoma to be good this year i
QljCaPiIM1s,660480,662399,you know for me that's my pick to win
QljCaPiIM1s,662399,664880,the big 12 this year uh i know that's
QljCaPiIM1s,664880,666160,not really stepping out there or
QljCaPiIM1s,666160,667680,anything but of course you know venables
QljCaPiIM1s,667680,669519,is their new coaching staff and all that
QljCaPiIM1s,669519,671760,um so there are some changes there
QljCaPiIM1s,671760,673920,but i i think you know the talent wins
QljCaPiIM1s,673920,676560,out uh there in norman the sooners
QljCaPiIM1s,676560,678880,probably uh take on the crown reclaimed
QljCaPiIM1s,678880,681120,the crown after uh baylor winning it
QljCaPiIM1s,681120,683519,last year um and i think they beat texas
QljCaPiIM1s,683519,684959,tech in lubbock to finish the regular
QljCaPiIM1s,684959,686399,season so
QljCaPiIM1s,686399,688320,there it is six and six that's how i see
QljCaPiIM1s,688320,690880,it i i consider an accomplishment uh
QljCaPiIM1s,690880,692560,considering the schedule
QljCaPiIM1s,692560,694000,which is difficult very difficult this
QljCaPiIM1s,694000,695360,year if you had another florida
QljCaPiIM1s,695360,697360,international instead of nc state hey
QljCaPiIM1s,697360,699440,maybe seven wins you know but it's going
QljCaPiIM1s,699440,701760,to be a battle to get to six wins i know
QljCaPiIM1s,701760,703600,the coaching staff and the players have
QljCaPiIM1s,703600,705600,higher expectations than that as as it
QljCaPiIM1s,705600,707839,should be as they should be but just
QljCaPiIM1s,707839,709839,realistically taking a look at the
QljCaPiIM1s,709839,712800,schedule that's where i see uh the red
QljCaPiIM1s,712800,715040,raiders again in june i reserve the
QljCaPiIM1s,715040,718079,right in august to say you know what
QljCaPiIM1s,718079,720320,no i'm better handled on these teams i'm
QljCaPiIM1s,720320,722639,a better handle on this roster this is
QljCaPiIM1s,722639,725600,my prediction so look for my official
QljCaPiIM1s,725600,727920,uh prediction later this summer or right
QljCaPiIM1s,727920,729839,before the season kicks off but
QljCaPiIM1s,729839,731120,as of right now i see texas tech
QljCaPiIM1s,731120,732800,finishing six and six and going back to
QljCaPiIM1s,732800,734399,a bowl game so with that i want to thank
QljCaPiIM1s,734399,737920,you for watching and until next time
