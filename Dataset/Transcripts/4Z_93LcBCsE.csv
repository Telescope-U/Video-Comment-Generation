4Z_93LcBCsE,266720,272560,you have a dog how many of you have ever  had a dog that had a flea on them  that's everybody
4Z_93LcBCsE,272560,278960,you ever seen a flea one of the smallest  insects  really small on the smallest insects but
4Z_93LcBCsE,278960,285199,for his height  and size  and flea has the highest vertical leap
4Z_93LcBCsE,285199,291440,in nature for an insect  a flea can jump has a 36 inch vertical
4Z_93LcBCsE,291440,297440,a flea man can come 36 inches off the  ground his vertical is 36 the average
4Z_93LcBCsE,297440,303759,person can't do that but a flea can jump  36 inches off the ground if you capture  the fleet and you put him in a man-age
4Z_93LcBCsE,303759,308880,job and you put the lid on it the flea  know one thing i got a 36-inch vertical
4Z_93LcBCsE,308880,315919,so here he go he started jumping but he  gonna hit himself on that lid cause he  got that lid on it but after a while
4Z_93LcBCsE,315919,322840,after getting knocked down so many times  the flea makes an adjustment  so now the flea only jumps
4Z_93LcBCsE,322840,329759,just to where he don't get knocked back  down  he got 36 vertical but since this lid is
4Z_93LcBCsE,329759,335199,on his environment  got him now jumping nowhere near what he  can
4Z_93LcBCsE,335199,341039,capture some mo fleas and put him in  there they got 36 verticals but then  they start jumping they find out they
4Z_93LcBCsE,341039,347440,keep getting knocked down they start  doing what the other fleas is doing next  thing you know i got a job full of fleas
4Z_93LcBCsE,347440,354720,and i ain't even using a 36 inch  vertical because they got a lid on the  job then fleas have babies then babies
4Z_93LcBCsE,354720,361440,is born into the conditions of the  environment so now guess what the flea  is born with a 36 inch vertical but
4Z_93LcBCsE,361440,366479,because he see his mommy and daddy and  all his cousins and friends jumping just
4Z_93LcBCsE,366479,375600,barely to the roof you know what he do  he duplicates that behavior  the flea never reaches his potential
4Z_93LcBCsE,375600,382479,until you take the top off of your  mayonnaise jar you gonna duplicate your
4Z_93LcBCsE,382479,389840,surroundings if you take a oak tree seed  and you put it in a two foot pot
4Z_93LcBCsE,389840,396400,that seed will never become the oak tree  that oak trees are capable of becoming
4Z_93LcBCsE,396400,402000,because it's gonna get stifled by the  two foot pot now check this out ain't
4Z_93LcBCsE,402000,410000,nothing wrong with the seed  seed just fell prey to the environment  you are a seed from god
4Z_93LcBCsE,410000,415599,god made you in his likeness  he big he vast
4Z_93LcBCsE,415599,422560,don't you allow your environment  to dictate the oak tree that you become

4Z_93LcBCsE,471680,476800,comedy man oh lord have mercy  you can't get into comedy you ain't even
4Z_93LcBCsE,476800,483840,funny how you gonna make money telling  jokes now in the beginning  it looked like they was right
4Z_93LcBCsE,483840,491759,but i never gave up  all i did was identified this gift  i wrote all of my visions down
4Z_93LcBCsE,491759,498960,i read them every morning and every  night  i instilled them in my head and every
4Z_93LcBCsE,498960,505840,time i met somebody they say hey man  what you trying to do i would tell them  one of my visions somebody would always
4Z_93LcBCsE,505840,512159,say to me you know i know a guy  that's selling them things right there  you ought to talk to him i started
4Z_93LcBCsE,512159,518640,scratching stuff off my vision board my  vision board's so vast now if i showed  you what was on it you wouldn't even
4Z_93LcBCsE,518640,524880,believe it because i dreamed so big i  want so big because the god i serve is
4Z_93LcBCsE,524880,530640,big he's not a small god  he's a really really big guy he does
4Z_93LcBCsE,530640,536080,really really big stuff and i expect him  to do really really big stuff for me if
4Z_93LcBCsE,536080,542399,he'd have done it for oprah if he'd have  done it for the obamas whoever got why i  can't have this hill
4Z_93LcBCsE,542399,548320,i'm going to do better with it than all  of them to me but why you can't have  that that's how you get what you want in
4Z_93LcBCsE,548320,554480,life now you don't have to believe me  but here's the deal  if you keep doing what you've been doing
4Z_93LcBCsE,554480,560800,you're going to keep getting what you've  been getting  if i just told you a different way to go  about it you don't need no money i just
4Z_93LcBCsE,560800,566320,gave you some scriptures you could try  and some principles if somebody who had  come from the bottom and got to this
4Z_93LcBCsE,566320,571760,position i'm in told me that this is the  way i would try if i was you i would try  that
4Z_93LcBCsE,571760,578640,i bet you it'll work there's a  difference between your passion and your  gift
4Z_93LcBCsE,578640,584720,your passion is something that you enjoy  doing like i'm passionate about golf
4Z_93LcBCsE,584720,590399,it ain't what i do  it's i suck  it's just not what i do
4Z_93LcBCsE,590399,598240,i'm gifted  at words  i'm gifted at that so before you strike
4Z_93LcBCsE,598240,606480,off into script writing  determine your gift  whatever it is you're trying to do
4Z_93LcBCsE,606480,611519,you must first determine  if it is your gift
4Z_93LcBCsE,611519,618720,and don't pursue things that you're  passionate about  pursue the thing that you are gifted at
4Z_93LcBCsE,618720,625600,all of you are gifted  every last one of you god gave you a  gift at birth all of you god never
4Z_93LcBCsE,625600,632880,created a soul without giving him a gift  all of you have a gift  your job is to discover the gift
4Z_93LcBCsE,632880,638880,it's very simple it's the thing that you  do the absolute best with the least  amount of effort  that's your god-given gift anything else
4Z_93LcBCsE,638880,645040,you're doing you're wasting your time  unless you ain't no singer the you  sang it for now i don't care how good
4Z_93LcBCsE,645040,649440,you sound at the church church let  everybody sing
4Z_93LcBCsE,653680,662320,they let anybody go up there and say i  wasn't walking by myself with the lord
4Z_93LcBCsE,662320,666720,man why is your saying
4Z_93LcBCsE,667519,672959,but they not gifted discover the gift  so you should ask yourself first
4Z_93LcBCsE,672959,679440,is writing the gift  is writing the gift now the writing may
4Z_93LcBCsE,679440,685760,not lead you to screen writing or movies  it may lead you to books
4Z_93LcBCsE,685760,691760,but the first thing you need to do is  writing your gift  if it's your passion you're wasting your
4Z_93LcBCsE,691760,698480,time  you're going to write a book that don't  nobody like but you  i was watching joel osteen on tv one day
4Z_93LcBCsE,698480,704240,and he said people's opinion of you  is none of your business
4Z_93LcBCsE,704240,711920,nor should you make it yours  you you get in a lot of trouble worrying  about what somebody think about you
4Z_93LcBCsE,711920,718399,when really what difference do it make  whether they wrong or right what what
4Z_93LcBCsE,718399,725120,difference do it make the majority of  people who have a negative viewpoint of  you really don't even know you
4Z_93LcBCsE,725120,731200,what i found about being successful is  it wasn't me who changed
4Z_93LcBCsE,731200,737360,it was people's opinion of me that  changed  you know i got more but and i'm the same
4Z_93LcBCsE,737360,745760,dude  but your opinion of me has changed now  you think  i think i'm all that when in actuality
4Z_93LcBCsE,745760,751680,i really am humbled by all this i really  can't believe god let me have it
4Z_93LcBCsE,751680,756959,i really do understand  that i am here but by the grace of god
4Z_93LcBCsE,756959,763360,i'm clear about that i i am so clear  about that it ain't me
4Z_93LcBCsE,763360,770639,it's not me  see i know the decisions i made  and i know how it got me where i got to
4Z_93LcBCsE,770639,776079,i know how my life turned out when i  gave it over to him  i gave my life to god
4Z_93LcBCsE,776079,781440,now i may not be the christian you think  i ought to be  but once again
4Z_93LcBCsE,781440,786720,your opinion of me  it doesn't matter to me
4Z_93LcBCsE,786720,793760,i've just learned not to allow people  opinion of me to bother me or stop me
4Z_93LcBCsE,793760,799040,publicly man  i've been ridiculed and ate alive on  that internet
4Z_93LcBCsE,799040,805839,you this he think he this i can't stand  him he does he then you know i've been  everything on in here i don't care

4Z_93LcBCsE,812639,818959,to  seven days a week  the little dude that you keep hating on
4Z_93LcBCsE,818959,825199,that god i serve he ain't hating me yet  he ain't hating me not in that time
4Z_93LcBCsE,825199,830639,and i've discovered something  look man what god got for you
4Z_93LcBCsE,830639,836800,nobody  no hater  no employer no co-worker can stop
4Z_93LcBCsE,836800,842639,nothing god has for you  god is in the blessing business but  better than that he's in the forgiving
4Z_93LcBCsE,842639,849360,business  see if god wasn't a forgiving god i'm  not here today  but god had to forgive me
4Z_93LcBCsE,849360,855839,over and over and over and over and over  and over and over i can't count the
4Z_93LcBCsE,855839,862160,times he didn't forgave me  see i just never let my failures define  me  see when you make a mistake just get

4Z_93LcBCsE,1089280,1096240,about your life and your ass with sleep  [Music]  the bible says he who loves to sleep and
4Z_93LcBCsE,1096240,1102799,the folding of hands poverty will set  upon you like a thief in the night  if you're not happy with your life it's
4Z_93LcBCsE,1102799,1110480,because you're not living in your gift  and you are decided to pursue a passion  but i can't win no money
4Z_93LcBCsE,1110480,1116160,i can't make the cut  i'm a 16 handicap that's on a good date
4Z_93LcBCsE,1116160,1121840,[Music]  people i wanted to play in the nba when  i was growing up i wanted to play in the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1121840,1128160,league that was my goal to play in the  nba but i wasn't gifted at it though i  mean there's a couple of problems if i
4Z_93LcBCsE,1128160,1135039,ran at full speed i didn't had a ball  and when i shot it it ain't go in a lot
4Z_93LcBCsE,1135039,1140080,of times now you put that together you  can get you can quit talking about the  nba
4Z_93LcBCsE,1140080,1145120,my gift was i had the ability and i  didn't know it at a young age but i had
4Z_93LcBCsE,1145120,1150480,the ability to take information  instantly and transform it into comedy
4Z_93LcBCsE,1150480,1158080,i didn't know that was a gift i just  thought it was something i did it got me  in more trouble than i've ever it it has
4Z_93LcBCsE,1158080,1165440,been the biggest curse because when  you're young you don't know what to give  you're just doing it now as i got older  this gift has transformed a little bit i
4Z_93LcBCsE,1165440,1172080,can take information and turn it into  inspiration i can take information and  turn it into motivation and the reason
4Z_93LcBCsE,1172080,1178960,i'm here today is because my life has  been jacked up and i have learned  and mastered something i've mastered the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1178960,1186000,principles of success you can't tell me  i can't  that's what i've done  i've mastered the principles of success
4Z_93LcBCsE,1186000,1191120,i know them by heart inside out you  can't tell me nothing about it  about
4Z_93LcBCsE,1191120,1198240,success  i cannot help but  intertwine faith in that so if you don't
4Z_93LcBCsE,1198240,1205120,really care for the faith piece you  ain't gonna really care for me  because i cannot tell you how i made it
4Z_93LcBCsE,1205120,1210799,without telling you about god or the  principles every principle of success it
4Z_93LcBCsE,1210799,1216559,comes from god almighty it's in whatever  religious reading you read i don't  that's not my business what you believe
4Z_93LcBCsE,1216559,1222480,in you just got to believe in some i  told a group earlier i don't care what  you call god you can call god allah
4Z_93LcBCsE,1222480,1228320,jehovah yahweh you can call him whatever  you want to call him just call him  though it's his name my business what
4Z_93LcBCsE,1228320,1233679,you call him i don't care but i cannot  stand here and talk to you about my road
4Z_93LcBCsE,1233679,1241120,to success i cannot inspire these young  people that i tried to get to early  today and not intertwine faith so i'm
4Z_93LcBCsE,1241120,1246159,sorry if that ain't your thing but y'all  didn't pay me now so here i am i got the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1246159,1251760,money wide to my account so  here it is
4Z_93LcBCsE,1251760,1256799,take a deep breath uh  i tell people all the time you know and
4Z_93LcBCsE,1256799,1262320,i was talking to young people and what i  try to get people to understand is  i don't care who you are in the room if
4Z_93LcBCsE,1262320,1268240,you if you  got to a place in your life where you  felt like you know life should have been  more for you
4Z_93LcBCsE,1268240,1273520,or you're trying to figure your life out  there's one simple way to get it done
4Z_93LcBCsE,1273520,1280000,god when he created all of us he never  created an individual without bestowing  a gift you know
4Z_93LcBCsE,1280000,1287200,and god put that gift in all of us some  of you are gifted in  teaching networking counseling sharing
4Z_93LcBCsE,1287200,1293039,life saving some of your caretakers but  you gifted  if you work in your gift
4Z_93LcBCsE,1293039,1299200,you now find your purpose in life a real  meaning for waking up in the morning you  know a lot of people you you know people
4Z_93LcBCsE,1299200,1304480,that get them go to work in the morning  they just miserable they hate driving to  work they hate their job they hate their
4Z_93LcBCsE,1304480,1309679,co-workers because they ain't doing what  they want to do what they like now that  that's not your fault
4Z_93LcBCsE,1309679,1316400,that's their fault but god when he  created all of us he gave all of us a  gift we were born with a gift at birth
4Z_93LcBCsE,1316400,1322720,god ain't made nobody and gave him a  gift now the thing of it is if you stop  looking at your gift as running jumping
4Z_93LcBCsE,1322720,1329200,singing dancing then you can get on with  your life but so many people are  pursuing their passion instead of
4Z_93LcBCsE,1329200,1334799,pursuing their guilt  most of you have mastered the principles  of success but when you're talking to
4Z_93LcBCsE,1334799,1342320,young people you're talking to some  people that ain't mastered that aspect  yet it's our job to teach young people
4Z_93LcBCsE,1342320,1348640,the principles of success they got to  learn from your mistakes see i messed my  life up so i can turn around talk about
4Z_93LcBCsE,1348640,1356720,it one day i've been divorced twice  i've lost everything i own in my life  twice i lost it all again in 2005 at the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1356720,1363360,end of 2005 i had 1700.  in 2005 i had made millions of dollars i
4Z_93LcBCsE,1363360,1368640,had seventeen hundred dollars at the end  of 2005. i've been homeless i lived in a
4Z_93LcBCsE,1368640,1374480,car for three years i learned some  principles  and i started applying
4Z_93LcBCsE,1374480,1381840,so i'm a little bit different christian  than most people right here i just  happen to be a little bit more real  about it you know uh
4Z_93LcBCsE,1381840,1388720,i don't really know where a lot of  scriptures are in the bible i just  happen to know what's in there and what
4Z_93LcBCsE,1388720,1395679,ain't in there  and i had a lady the other day on my  show i had slipped up and cussed on one
4Z_93LcBCsE,1395679,1401360,of the commercial breaks because i've  been working on my cousin but uh
4Z_93LcBCsE,1401840,1407919,that's not really working for me i have  just come to the conclusion that i'm  just gonna be a cussing christian
4Z_93LcBCsE,1407919,1413520,i've been trying to get it and shake it  but it ain't working for me man  and i accidentally cussed on the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1413520,1420000,commercial break and the lady i could  tell she was a little put off by and i  didn't mean to you know i don't want to  be offensive to people but you know i
4Z_93LcBCsE,1420000,1425520,was just talking naturally and she just  stood up and said i have a question for  you mr heart
4Z_93LcBCsE,1425520,1431039,she said so how's your walk going with  christ
4Z_93LcBCsE,1431039,1437120,i thought about it i said well  i walk tall  i walk strong
4Z_93LcBCsE,1437120,1443039,with long strides and a slight limp  and that's how i walk
4Z_93LcBCsE,1443039,1449360,now if you ain't got no limp to your  walk congratulations  mine has a slight limp to it and every
4Z_93LcBCsE,1449360,1455200,now and then the flaws that i have come  out see between me and a lot of people i  happen to be famous so my flaws have a
4Z_93LcBCsE,1455200,1460320,microphone and a spotlight and an  internet connected to it you might can  make your mistake at the house and don't
4Z_93LcBCsE,1460320,1466880,nobody know nothing about it but i got  people watching me all day long so what  i've learned in this journey along the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1466880,1473600,way of having my life as twisted as it  was  i've learned the principles of success
4Z_93LcBCsE,1473600,1479919,i've learned how to get back up how to  fall and fail get written off say you  ain't gonna ever be nothing i've learned
4Z_93LcBCsE,1479919,1487039,how to start over i've learned how to  take one heap of all my winnings and  risk it on one turn or pitch and toss
4Z_93LcBCsE,1487039,1493600,lose and start again in my beginnings  and never once breathe a word about my  loss yeah i've learned stuff like this
4Z_93LcBCsE,1493600,1499679,that's rudyard kipling in case you  didn't recognize that little poem i  stole that that's when i was paying a
4Z_93LcBCsE,1499679,1506000,little bit attention in college i didn't  get the degree but i was listening just  a little bit
4Z_93LcBCsE,1506000,1511039,and when i talk to you i try to uh to  get people to identify with these
4Z_93LcBCsE,1511039,1516080,principles  the greatest thing that you could do in  your life i told the kids early you know
4Z_93LcBCsE,1516080,1521120,we're at a college institute so it's  kind of trips people out a little bit  when i say this and i tell them how
4Z_93LcBCsE,1521120,1526799,important it is to get your education  yada yada yada cause we had a college  that's what i got to say
4Z_93LcBCsE,1526799,1532559,but then i turn right around i tell them  the truth though the most important  thing in your life ain't your education
4Z_93LcBCsE,1532559,1537760,the most important thing in your life is  your dream  see the scripture says a man without a
4Z_93LcBCsE,1537760,1543919,dream or vision shall perish don't say  nothing about education  now you got to have one if you're going
4Z_93LcBCsE,1543919,1550000,to climb to certain jobs and go in the  corporate letter and be in banking and  be in finance and all this stuff y'all  doing but
4Z_93LcBCsE,1550000,1556400,it's the dream that propels you look man  we got to break this thing down real  simple for people someday quit acting
4Z_93LcBCsE,1556400,1562559,bulgy like you've been rich all your  life  that's what kill me you know i come to  these functions everybody sit up they
4Z_93LcBCsE,1562559,1569200,lean back in their chair they speak  proper grammar they get their nose up  you act like you had money all your life
4Z_93LcBCsE,1569200,1574720,i ain't have money all my life i come  into some money but i've been scrapping
4Z_93LcBCsE,1574720,1580559,and hustling and grinding and trying to  get over and so have you but then you  get here
4Z_93LcBCsE,1580559,1587600,and you don't have no memory of that  because now your life is fixed and so  now when you talk to young people you
4Z_93LcBCsE,1587600,1593120,you don't talk to them from the  perspective or you made mistakes too you  don't talk to young people like hey been
4Z_93LcBCsE,1593120,1598159,there done that  i smoke weed in college too man i know i  know where you at you don't want to tell
4Z_93LcBCsE,1598159,1603440,them that  yeah clinton smoke weed he the president  of the united states
4Z_93LcBCsE,1603440,1609440,i'm gonna probably say a lot of stuff i  already know  that i'm not coming back next year
4Z_93LcBCsE,1609440,1614640,that's clear  i ain't got no problem  see that's why i give my money wide to
4Z_93LcBCsE,1614640,1620159,me because i already know i'm gonna mess  around i say something  i'm gonna throw somebody into something
4Z_93LcBCsE,1620159,1625679,because i see a couple of looks on your  face right now but i don't really care
4Z_93LcBCsE,1625679,1632960,i'm out of here i'm gonna get on this  jet i'm gonna go down here my wife died  in miami man i'm gonna sleep with my  wife tonight i don't care what y'all do
4Z_93LcBCsE,1632960,1638159,i was telling you  about your gift this is how you save  yourself a lot of trouble and this may
4Z_93LcBCsE,1638159,1645120,apply to some adults in this world  maybe not  your gift is the thing that you do the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1645120,1650799,absolute best with the least amount of  effort  that's your god-given gift you ain't got
4Z_93LcBCsE,1650799,1656720,to trip on it  wonder about it it's what you do better  than anything else now whether you've
4Z_93LcBCsE,1656720,1662240,chosen to make that your life's work or  not that's your choice but i got news
4Z_93LcBCsE,1662240,1667360,for you if you don't ever pursue that  you ain't gonna ever be happy it's some
4Z_93LcBCsE,1667360,1674799,unhappy people in this room today  because there's some people in here  doing what people expect them to do and
4Z_93LcBCsE,1674799,1679840,doing what was required of them and they  just got locked into it now you got
4Z_93LcBCsE,1679840,1685840,bills in the family and you don't really  want to pursue your dream so now you got  the job you just don't ride it all the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1685840,1692320,way out there ain't nothing wrong with  that if your job is what you gifted at  doing this man is going to retire this
4Z_93LcBCsE,1692320,1698480,year but he's been in the education of  young people's minds he's been shaping  young people's mind for 30 years like
4Z_93LcBCsE,1698480,1704000,that that's what he was gifted to do  if you're sitting up in here
4Z_93LcBCsE,1704000,1709360,and you ain't happy  and you're in misery it's cause you  ain't pursued your gift and i'm telling
4Z_93LcBCsE,1709360,1716159,them young people over there with them  blue shirts on and them stripe ties find  out what your gift is and pursue it with
4Z_93LcBCsE,1716159,1721919,everything in you because ain't nothing  worse than getting a degree and you  don't even want it after you get it
4Z_93LcBCsE,1721919,1728000,because a degree ain't nothing but a  piece of paper hanging on a wall  now it signifies that you have the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1728000,1733600,ability to complete a task but your life  is made up of what you do with it life
4Z_93LcBCsE,1733600,1740080,is ten percent what happens it's 90 of  what you do about it  you got to do something with your life
4Z_93LcBCsE,1740080,1747600,man that makes your heart beat in the  morning when you wake up see people ask  me i'll tell how you do all these jobs  dude cause i like all my job you cut
4Z_93LcBCsE,1747600,1752880,your radio on  240 times a year i do a four hour live

4Z_93LcBCsE,1760399,1767360,i wake up in the morning i give people  some inspiration i play music and i tell  jokes okay boom i like doing that then i
4Z_93LcBCsE,1767360,1773000,go to a talk show i live in chicago  eight  months after year 34 weeks i tape
4Z_93LcBCsE,1773000,1778720,180 talk shows in chicago  how you do that every day cause i love

4Z_93LcBCsE,1786640,1793200,all them show once again they have a  check attached to this  but i love what i do if you cut your tv
4Z_93LcBCsE,1793200,1798320,on it's obvious that i love what i do  i'm always smiling because god has given
4Z_93LcBCsE,1798320,1804399,me the life of my dreams because i'm  living in the gift he gave me
4Z_93LcBCsE,1804399,1810399,if you live in your gift man it changes  your life do something about your guilt
4Z_93LcBCsE,1810399,1816799,listen to me i don't care what job you  got now  if it's something that really burns on  the inside of you you ought to go do
4Z_93LcBCsE,1816799,1823919,that i don't care how old you are how  come you think kentucky fried chicken  how come you think that man on the side
4Z_93LcBCsE,1823919,1828960,why you think he old  cause his recipe got discovered when he
4Z_93LcBCsE,1828960,1836159,was 68. that ain't the picture of the  colonel when he was 35  but he been frying chicken you know you
4Z_93LcBCsE,1836159,1841200,can't just wake them start frying  chicken  he been frying chicken with this secret
4Z_93LcBCsE,1841200,1847120,recipe for years it took him a long time  for a click but he kept frying chicken
4Z_93LcBCsE,1847120,1853760,man  till he became the biggest chicken joint  in the world  you can't go nowhere and don't see
4Z_93LcBCsE,1853760,1859039,kentucky fried chicken that ain't real  chicken  but when he was living it was real
4Z_93LcBCsE,1859039,1865120,chicken though  it really was chicken it was the actual  parts if you peel that skin off that
4Z_93LcBCsE,1865120,1870640,kentucky fried chicken you're in for a  surprise it don't look nothing like
4Z_93LcBCsE,1870640,1876080,but he hit it  when is it too late to hit it  when is it really too late to hit the
4Z_93LcBCsE,1876080,1882480,jackpot  when is it when you 60 that's too late  you don't want to be rich then what  you're 65 too late for you to be rich
4Z_93LcBCsE,1882480,1888960,when is it too late to hit it  man put some spark in your life have  something to wake up about to make your
4Z_93LcBCsE,1888960,1894799,heart beat in the morning have a joyous  spirit when you wake up in the morning  here's another principle of success i'ma
4Z_93LcBCsE,1894799,1901519,tell you what rich people talk about all  the time you know rich people talk about  all time they talk about money  all the time
4Z_93LcBCsE,1901519,1908320,all the principles of successes in the  bible  see a man is as he thinks
4Z_93LcBCsE,1908320,1915120,so what you think  excuse the grammar but that's what you  is
4Z_93LcBCsE,1915760,1924320,don't tell it make better sense bad  grammar makes better sense sometimes  if a man is as he thinking then what you
4Z_93LcBCsE,1924320,1930159,think is what you is that make real good  sense to me see ya i like to keep it
4Z_93LcBCsE,1930159,1936080,where people remember stuff i say  so rich people you know what they do to  talk about money now when you talk about
4Z_93LcBCsE,1936080,1942080,money around people they get tight  because they don't want to hear the  money well money is not everything and
4Z_93LcBCsE,1942080,1948880,and money money can't buy you happy they  ain't got no money  money might not buy you happiness but it
4Z_93LcBCsE,1948880,1954399,parked you right in front of happy house  you can get out rang double see if happy  home
4Z_93LcBCsE,1954399,1959440,there's nothing wrong with mother people  so many things have been said over the  years but rich people get together they
4Z_93LcBCsE,1959440,1964880,talk about money they talk about  business all the time there's nothing  wrong with that see we we go to church
4Z_93LcBCsE,1964880,1970960,and we learn the wrong thing you know  what messed me up man when i was little  i went to church in cleveland you know
4Z_93LcBCsE,1970960,1976640,and a  preacher would always say  he says hard for a rich man to get into
4Z_93LcBCsE,1976640,1981919,the kingdom of heaven as it is for a  camel to get through the eye of a needle
4Z_93LcBCsE,1981919,1988159,now me and the rest of the ignorant  members we thought  that you was trying to take a needle
4Z_93LcBCsE,1988159,1994559,with sewing thread and push a camel  through it  all the people in my church collectively

4Z_93LcBCsE,2336000,2341280,before  my all of my years of school  and
4Z_93LcBCsE,2341280,2346400,she asked me to stand  and when i stood she said little stevie
4Z_93LcBCsE,2346400,2351839,come to the front of the class and i'm  thinking to myself this is it
4Z_93LcBCsE,2351839,2357599,this is the gold star morning  i've been waiting 10 years for this
4Z_93LcBCsE,2357599,2364320,i ain't never got to start before this  is the day  so i started walking to the front
4Z_93LcBCsE,2364320,2371599,i'm skinny i got my brother's clothes on  because we were poor i got up there and  she said steve let me ask you something

4Z_93LcBCsE,2387680,2394560,the paper folk  now i'm thinking to myself  judging by the tone
4Z_93LcBCsE,2394560,2399760,of this conversation  this
4Z_93LcBCsE,2399760,2405280,might not be the gold star moment i  thought it was gonna be
4Z_93LcBCsE,2406160,2411440,so i started cowering down  and she said so why did you write it on
4Z_93LcBCsE,2411440,2416880,the paper  and i said because you asked us to voice  is really soft she said do you know
4Z_93LcBCsE,2416880,2422560,anybody on tv  anybody in this school ever been on tv i  said no

4Z_93LcBCsE,3363200,3369680,i had wrote this joke  uh  mike tyson had got in a fight in harlem
4Z_93LcBCsE,3369680,3376079,with his heavyweight name mitch green  mike tyson had hit the dude in the eye  in the store now he was on the news his
4Z_93LcBCsE,3376079,3382000,eye was swollen so the joke i wrote was  they was interviewing mitch green
4Z_93LcBCsE,3382000,3387040,and he was telling everybody what  happened but his eye  took over the interview
4Z_93LcBCsE,3387040,3392240,and i wrote this joke that his eyes  started talking  and was just
4Z_93LcBCsE,3392240,3399520,i'll tell you what happened the  heavyweight champ's fist is coming  towards my face i just say lord lord
4Z_93LcBCsE,3399520,3405680,lord  and i wrote this whole joke about this  dude's eyeball talking
4Z_93LcBCsE,3405680,3412079,and when the punch came  and all this here  [Applause]  i walked off stage man just started
4Z_93LcBCsE,3412079,3417520,crying  i couldn't believe it they paid made 750
4Z_93LcBCsE,3417520,3424640,for being on tv for one night  i'd never made  750 dollars telling jokes in one night
4Z_93LcBCsE,3424640,3431920,and so  that was my first television appearance  couple weeks later  sinbad was the host of the show he got
4Z_93LcBCsE,3431920,3438400,this job  at on a different world  and so he quit
4Z_93LcBCsE,3438400,3443440,and so mark curry became the host and  then mark curry got hanging with mr
4Z_93LcBCsE,3443440,3450079,cooper and he quit and they came to me  and said would you come back to new york
4Z_93LcBCsE,3450079,3455839,and host amateur night for us to just  try you out  ain't no problem
4Z_93LcBCsE,3455839,3461680,so i went to new york i hosted amateur  night  and i was killing but every time we went
4Z_93LcBCsE,3461680,3468160,to commercial break i was supposed to  let the warm-up act take over like  reuben does  but i knew not to let the warm-up act do
4Z_93LcBCsE,3468160,3474000,that because he would change the  attitude of the crowd because the apollo  was a wild play so i stayed out there i
4Z_93LcBCsE,3474000,3479200,did the warm-up and the holster and i  created a bond with that audience and
4Z_93LcBCsE,3479200,3485040,that's how i got on tv it was my very  first tv show i hosted showtime  department i ended up being the longest
4Z_93LcBCsE,3485040,3490400,running host in the history of showtime  i did that show for eight years nobody
4Z_93LcBCsE,3490400,3497119,ever did it for eight years  and that was my turn back moment  see in your life
4Z_93LcBCsE,3497119,3504240,everybody has a turn back moment  you have a moment where you can go  forward or you can give up
4Z_93LcBCsE,3504240,3510319,the thing you have to keep in mind  before you give up  is that if you give up
4Z_93LcBCsE,3510319,3516799,the guarantee is  it will never happen  that's the guarantee of quitting that it
4Z_93LcBCsE,3516799,3523040,will never happen no way under the sun  the only way the possibility remains
4Z_93LcBCsE,3523040,3528799,that it can happen is if you never give  up no matter what
4Z_93LcBCsE,3528799,3534079,because god is always coming  he's never too late
4Z_93LcBCsE,3534079,3540720,at your worst smoke look man  when they told me  i had to be in new york i saw no way i
4Z_93LcBCsE,3540720,3546640,could get that  but that god don't  he make the phone ring
4Z_93LcBCsE,3546640,3553599,i end up in florida i make three hundred  dollars  then i go to new york i make seven  hundred fifty dollars i almost got a
4Z_93LcBCsE,3553599,3559920,thousand dollars  out of nowhere that's that's what  happened to me that was my
4Z_93LcBCsE,3559920,3565200,my moment of never giving up that's when  i first learned that faith was  everything that
4Z_93LcBCsE,3565200,3572000,that you have to remain faithful  when i was homeless  i had a lot of time to myself actually
4Z_93LcBCsE,3572000,3578880,becoming homeless was exactly what i  needed because god needed my undivided  attention and he had it for three
4Z_93LcBCsE,3578880,3584720,straight years because i had nothing  and i'm just one of them people where
4Z_93LcBCsE,3584720,3590079,sometimes you just got to get my  attention you know what i mean so  i can't tell you about no education
4Z_93LcBCsE,3590079,3595760,because i ain't got one i ain't got no  degree in nothing  i've been told my whole life you'll
4Z_93LcBCsE,3595760,3601920,never be nothing simply because of the  way you talk  you know how many times i've been the  way i talk man cause you know what i'm
4Z_93LcBCsE,3601920,3608000,kind of country i don't really  i don't really speak that good you know  my my english is not eloquent
4Z_93LcBCsE,3608000,3614640,i know that  but i ain't never let that stop me  when i first got on tv at nbc seven
4Z_93LcBCsE,3614640,3619920,years ago they sent a uh  the a linguist
4Z_93LcBCsE,3619920,3626640,to see me i didn't even know what that  was i thought this lady was gonna show  me how to make spaghetti or something
4Z_93LcBCsE,3626640,3632160,i didn't know i never heard what is a  linguist  so the woman comes in my office and she
4Z_93LcBCsE,3632160,3639520,says are we ready to begin and i said  excuse me ma'am who are you  she says i'm your grammar coach
4Z_93LcBCsE,3639520,3645119,i say it for  what she said  nbc is up to the understanding in order
4Z_93LcBCsE,3645119,3650160,for you to be successful on daytime tv  you're going to have to learn how to  speak more eloquently
4Z_93LcBCsE,3650160,3657520,i say i ain't going to do all that  she said excuse me what did you just say
4Z_93LcBCsE,3657520,3664720,i said i ain't going to do all that that  she said say what you just said to me  again slowly i said i
4Z_93LcBCsE,3664720,3672000,ain't  fiddling  do all  laid down
4Z_93LcBCsE,3672319,3679520,she said that's exactly why i'm here  [Music]  because that is improper grammar on
4Z_93LcBCsE,3679520,3686079,every level  i say yeah but that's i talk just like  this here she said say that again i said
4Z_93LcBCsE,3686079,3693200,i talked just like this here she said  slow that down i say i talk  just like this him
4Z_93LcBCsE,3693200,3699599,what's the problem she said if you don't  learn how to speak more properly you'll  never be successful
4Z_93LcBCsE,3699599,3706640,i said who told you that  you walked into my office i'm already on
4Z_93LcBCsE,3706640,3712960,tv  you know what where you trying to go  with this
4Z_93LcBCsE,3712960,3719359,see the reason i'm not gonna let you  change my mind is cause i've never known  you up until this point not made it to
4Z_93LcBCsE,3719359,3724480,this point without you i don't know how  you feel i ain't gonna get the rest of  the way without you so i'm just looking
4Z_93LcBCsE,3724480,3730319,at this lady she says listen to me if  you don't learn how to speak better
4Z_93LcBCsE,3730319,3735839,you'll be off tv i said okay well let me  ask you some  i said which one of these sound best to
4Z_93LcBCsE,3735839,3742640,you  [Music]  i am  broke or army is rich
4Z_93LcBCsE,3742640,3749039,i mean you know look man  god  [Music]
4Z_93LcBCsE,3749039,3754799,gave me a life i never even really  dreamed yet  he gave me even beyond what i dreamed of
4Z_93LcBCsE,3754799,3761359,i mean you think about it  the money they pay me  is to wake up
4Z_93LcBCsE,3761359,3769359,i either play music  or i tell jokes  i either play music or i tell jokes i
4Z_93LcBCsE,3769359,3776720,entertain people for a living  they give me money  that's a blessing man see see when i
4Z_93LcBCsE,3776720,3782960,wake up  i don't have to go to work i get to go
4Z_93LcBCsE,3782960,3789119,to work  see that's the difference man some  people have to go to work i get to go to
4Z_93LcBCsE,3789119,3794240,work i get to i don't have to  you know i mean i was doing this for
4Z_93LcBCsE,3794240,3800480,years for no money but through grace and  mercy you know he just kept blessing me
4Z_93LcBCsE,3800480,3806240,and then you know i got other things i  want to accomplish you know i'm not  through  and i've been at this a long time man
4Z_93LcBCsE,3806240,3812160,like i'm i'm thinking about the end you  know  but  all i want to do now is make enough
4Z_93LcBCsE,3812160,3818400,money  to change uh  kids life  you know my foundation is the most
4Z_93LcBCsE,3818400,3824640,important thing i'll do some stuff  over here in ghana botswana and joe bird
4Z_93LcBCsE,3824640,3829920,those are three cities i'm targeting for  my foundation to come and change you  know so
4Z_93LcBCsE,3829920,3835440,that's what it is now  that's motivation and then you know i'm  a trailblazer man i got to show other
4Z_93LcBCsE,3835440,3841680,people how to do it you know my job now  is to show y'all how i did it that's why  i talk all the time about
4Z_93LcBCsE,3841680,3847520,motivation i talk more about motivation  now than i do comedy  because you know your career is what you
4Z_93LcBCsE,3847520,3854559,pay for your calling is what you made  so i'm in the calling part of my life  now you know i have to like when you ask
4Z_93LcBCsE,3854559,3860319,me a question  say i can't just  like if i tell you you got to write it  down
4Z_93LcBCsE,3860319,3868000,i'm telling you how to make it i'm just  you have to do this now you can try to  do it if you could try to not do it
4Z_93LcBCsE,3868000,3873599,it's gonna be hard  but so i always try to give people  little pieces of wisdom
4Z_93LcBCsE,3873599,3878720,because you're young you know everybody  in this room you want to be happy  and you want to be successful
4Z_93LcBCsE,3878720,3885039,everybody in here wants to be happy and  successful if you don't want to be happy  success there's something wrong with you
4Z_93LcBCsE,3885039,3892720,most people want to be happy and  successful you just need the key  the how-to that's my job to show you how
4Z_93LcBCsE,3892720,3897920,to like if i give you one scripture that  can change your life and i tell you  rebecca two or two
4Z_93LcBCsE,3897920,3903039,and then  you don't follow that that's not my  fault
4Z_93LcBCsE,3903039,3908640,so now you know  that you have to write it down like if  you look at my iphone my iphone has my
