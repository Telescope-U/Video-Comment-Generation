SoNu7gNl1I4,1550,4963,What we wear says a lot about who we are.
SoNu7gNl1I4,4963,9010,Yet fashion is also a $2.5 trillion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,9010,11103,that touches everyone on Earth.
SoNu7gNl1I4,12750,14250,I'm Imran Amed.
SoNu7gNl1I4,14250,16890,I first started trying to make sense of the fashion business
SoNu7gNl1I4,16890,21020,"15 years ago, as it was being transformed by technology,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,21020,24540,"globalization, and shifting consumer values."
SoNu7gNl1I4,24540,27368,And so stuff like this would just end up in a landfill.
SoNu7gNl1I4,27368,28584,Yeah.
SoNu7gNl1I4,28584,31542,Now I'm on a journey to see how fashion is recalibrating
SoNu7gNl1I4,31542,35895,after the pandemic to balance profit with purpose.
SoNu7gNl1I4,35895,38120,This is the Business of Fashion Show.
SoNu7gNl1I4,38120,42079,"Join me to discover how fashion shapes, business, culture,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,42080,43330,"and identity,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,43330,46263,and to meet the people forging fashion's future.
SoNu7gNl1I4,52810,54180,"Well, I'm back here in Paris"
SoNu7gNl1I4,54180,57360,for the first time in 16 months.
SoNu7gNl1I4,57360,59960,And it's the first time the global fashion community
SoNu7gNl1I4,59960,64712,is really getting together since March 2020.
SoNu7gNl1I4,65620,68530,"It's Haute Couture Week, the most exclusive,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,68530,71460,most elaborate and most creative event
SoNu7gNl1I4,71460,72913,on the fashion calendar.
SoNu7gNl1I4,74520,77070,"This is a world of rules and traditions,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,77070,80280,of exquisite workmanship and high net worth clients
SoNu7gNl1I4,80280,82500,able to pay six figures for a gown.
SoNu7gNl1I4,82500,84090,Do you buy couture?
SoNu7gNl1I4,84090,84923,Absolutely.
SoNu7gNl1I4,84923,85756,Yeah.
SoNu7gNl1I4,85756,88229,Yet the trailblazing designers we're about to meet
SoNu7gNl1I4,88230,89993,may not be what you expect.
SoNu7gNl1I4,90970,93990,"Among them, a true disruptor in fashion,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,93990,96710,the man who made a billion dollar industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,96710,98320,out of ugly sneakers
SoNu7gNl1I4,98320,100920,is staging Balenciaga's first couture show
SoNu7gNl1I4,100920,102137,in over 50 years.
SoNu7gNl1I4,102137,103410,How are you?
SoNu7gNl1I4,103410,105380,We had an exclusive preview.
SoNu7gNl1I4,105380,108369,"Couture, for me, has something very modern"
SoNu7gNl1I4,108370,111460,in its concept because we only produce what somebody orders.
SoNu7gNl1I4,111460,114280,This is like the most sustainable way of consuming.
SoNu7gNl1I4,114280,116360,"And the rising star of Paris,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,116360,119380,whose highly creative collections placed the planet
SoNu7gNl1I4,119380,122090,"before profit, embedding sustainability"
SoNu7gNl1I4,122090,123700,into her design process.
SoNu7gNl1I4,123700,125969,We really have to think about the planet
SoNu7gNl1I4,125970,127650,"that we are destroying every day,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,127650,129920,"so I was hoping that maybe, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,129920,131910,some other people of the fashion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,131910,133560,were thinking about that.
SoNu7gNl1I4,133560,135300,But to really understand what's happening
SoNu7gNl1I4,135300,136810,"in Paris this week,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,136810,140323,it's important to take stock of the last 18 months.
SoNu7gNl1I4,143920,147750,2020 was the worst year in the history of modern luxury.
SoNu7gNl1I4,147750,151090,"Before that, annual revenues for the luxury fashion market"
SoNu7gNl1I4,151090,153386,topped $380 billion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,155530,157260,More than two thirds of growth was buoyed
SoNu7gNl1I4,157260,162260,"by the Chinese, at home, but especially as tourists abroad."
SoNu7gNl1I4,162490,165350,"The lion's share of revenues came from accessories,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,165350,168873,"especially handbags, with designer sneakers catching up."
SoNu7gNl1I4,170870,174159,"Then, Wuhan, China locked down."
SoNu7gNl1I4,174160,178250,Covid hit Europe during the 2020 spring fashion show season.
SoNu7gNl1I4,178250,180140,Giorgio Armani livestreamed his show
SoNu7gNl1I4,180140,182550,"from an empty theater in Milan,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,182550,184480,"but other brands forged on,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,184480,187252,with shows packed full of fashion insiders.
SoNu7gNl1I4,188430,191120,"In a global business so interconnected,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,191120,194530,unforeseen consequences of the pandemic came to light.
SoNu7gNl1I4,194530,197120,Delayed weddings led to canceled embroidery orders
SoNu7gNl1I4,197120,198400,"out of Paris,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,198400,199680,threatening the livelihoods
SoNu7gNl1I4,199680,202254,of the Karigar artisans of India.
SoNu7gNl1I4,202254,205670,Luxury revenues plunged by more than 20%.
SoNu7gNl1I4,205670,207440,Companies cut costs.
SoNu7gNl1I4,207440,209330,"But by the end of 2020,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,209330,213043,Covid-19 had still devastated industry profitability.
SoNu7gNl1I4,215510,217409,"Fashion was forced to adapt,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,217410,221260,using technology to drive creative and business innovation.
SoNu7gNl1I4,221260,222980,The fashion business was re-imagined
SoNu7gNl1I4,222980,226823,"through distance selling, online films and virtual fashion."
SoNu7gNl1I4,228750,231120,"The luxury industry bounced back,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,231120,234659,"dominated by the mega brands, Hermes and Chanel,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,234660,237953,"and the mega groups, LVMH, Kering and Richemont."
SoNu7gNl1I4,239880,241980,By the first half of 2021
SoNu7gNl1I4,241980,243720,revenues for some of the biggest names
SoNu7gNl1I4,243720,247220,were up as much as 40% on pre-pandemic levels
SoNu7gNl1I4,247220,249003,delivering record profits.
SoNu7gNl1I4,250170,252069,"From an economic perspective,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,252070,255130,these super winners are emerging from the pandemic
SoNu7gNl1I4,255130,256233,even stronger.
SoNu7gNl1I4,257840,260810,"Now, there is a reawakening in Paris,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,260810,263780,the global capital of luxury fashion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,263780,265700,It's a historical echo.
SoNu7gNl1I4,265700,268630,The last time fashion burst back to life here
SoNu7gNl1I4,268630,270350,"was after World War Two,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,270350,274800,"with the sensation that was Christian Dior's ""New Look""."
SoNu7gNl1I4,274800,276919,It will take more than a new silhouette
SoNu7gNl1I4,276920,279770,to transform the fashion industry now.
SoNu7gNl1I4,279770,282729,"I mean, the big question for me is, really,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,282730,284790,where does the industry go from here?
SoNu7gNl1I4,284790,287010,"And you know, how does it need to adapt and change"
SoNu7gNl1I4,287010,290490,to be kind of fit for this new world
SoNu7gNl1I4,290490,291490,that we're entering?
SoNu7gNl1I4,292380,294920,"To find out more about this reawakening,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,294920,296530,I met with a fashion insider
SoNu7gNl1I4,296530,300093,with his finger on the creative pulse of Parisian fashion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,300960,301793,Pierre!
SoNu7gNl1I4,301793,303380,"Hey Imran, how are you?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,303380,304350,"Good, how are you?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,304350,305430,I'm good.
SoNu7gNl1I4,305430,308979,"Pierre Alexandre M'Pel√©, also known as Pam Boy,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,308980,310830,caught the ear of fashion insiders
SoNu7gNl1I4,310830,313580,for his honest online fashion critiques.
SoNu7gNl1I4,313580,314629,Is that an earring?
SoNu7gNl1I4,314630,318290,"Yeah, it's Alan Crocetti, it's like a little rose."
SoNu7gNl1I4,318290,321490,"I was like, fashion moment."
SoNu7gNl1I4,321490,324729,"Now, he collaborates with the respected fashion editor,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,324730,326930,"Katie Grand, at Perfect,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,326930,330302,a fashion media company founded amid the pandemic.
SoNu7gNl1I4,331290,333880,"What is La Perle, like, why did you pick this place?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,333880,335170,Who comes here?
SoNu7gNl1I4,335170,339310,"Everyone, it's you know, designers and, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,339310,341169,"we always joke about, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,341170,342590,dress well and come to La Perle
SoNu7gNl1I4,342590,345090,and you'll get an internship or you'll find a job.
SoNu7gNl1I4,346640,348920,"In the 1960s or '70s,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,348920,352900,"there was no luxury industry, you know?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,352900,356560,"But now luxury is this global industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,356560,358190,and what's the role of luxury?
SoNu7gNl1I4,358190,360240,"I mean, I think the role of luxury"
SoNu7gNl1I4,360240,363539,is to preserve craftsmanship.
SoNu7gNl1I4,363540,368260,"We tend to, you know, look down on manual work and craft,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,368260,369960,"and I think luxury,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,369960,372470,"if anything, has always been about that."
SoNu7gNl1I4,372470,375710,Going back to Louis XIV in France
SoNu7gNl1I4,375710,377639,"and how he developed, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,377640,380933,the French fashion industry as we know it today.
SoNu7gNl1I4,382490,384800,As you think about the fashion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,384800,386970,"we want to create for the future,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,386970,390080,do you feel like there's actually real change happening
SoNu7gNl1I4,390080,391970,or is it at the surface?
SoNu7gNl1I4,391970,395380,"I mean, I feel like changing the structures of power"
SoNu7gNl1I4,395380,398160,"in the industry and how they interconnect,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,398160,400460,I feel like companies need to take risks.
SoNu7gNl1I4,400460,402250,They need diversity and inclusion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,402250,404020,I feel like fashion is a global conversation.
SoNu7gNl1I4,404020,405919,"Everyone is concerned, you know."
SoNu7gNl1I4,405920,407260,I don't think that would have happened
SoNu7gNl1I4,407260,408820,if it weren't for the pandemic.
SoNu7gNl1I4,408820,411240,"I mean, Paris felt weird, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,411240,413330,between the pandemic and the whole conversation
SoNu7gNl1I4,413330,414163,"of Black Lives Matter,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,414163,416490,"which was something very new in France,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,416490,418410,I feel like as soon as we started talking
SoNu7gNl1I4,418410,420380,"about systemic racism in the industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,420380,423200,a lot of people reached out to me and came to realize that
SoNu7gNl1I4,423200,427450,"fashion is also about how do we want society to be,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,427450,430250,"for example, in the '60s with the sexual revolution,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,430250,432380,"and women started wearing miniskirt,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,432380,435610,"that was fashion changing society and shaping society,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,435610,439689,"and you know, pushing new ideas about womanhood"
SoNu7gNl1I4,439690,441330,"and what a woman could be,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,441330,442569,"and now with menswear,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,442570,445030,"there's been a lot of conversation about masculinity,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,445030,446460,"what it means to be a man,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,446460,450479,and I think that it's questions that fashion can answer
SoNu7gNl1I4,450480,452810,"fashion is probably the best, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,452810,455050,medium to answer those questions.
SoNu7gNl1I4,455050,457340,"I always say, it's time to open the windows."
SoNu7gNl1I4,457340,462340,"We need a fresh breeze of newness to kind of, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,462490,464633,swipe through to the industry.
SoNu7gNl1I4,467020,470419,It really does feel like change is the watchword here.
SoNu7gNl1I4,470420,473350,As I caught up with top designers and creatives
SoNu7gNl1I4,473350,475620,in town for Paris Fashion Week.
SoNu7gNl1I4,475620,477160,"You know, everyone was talking about a reset,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,477160,479250,are we going back to where we were?
SoNu7gNl1I4,479250,482340,"I hope not personally, but I mean, change is a subtle one."
SoNu7gNl1I4,482340,483480,"I mean, the truth of the matter is,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,483480,487717,we've got centuries and decades of this fashion world
SoNu7gNl1I4,487717,491510,and fashion business and hopefully the mentalities evolve.
SoNu7gNl1I4,491510,493140,And I don't think we should go back completely
SoNu7gNl1I4,493140,494113,to where we were.
SoNu7gNl1I4,495360,497189,"There is like, it's a big movement"
SoNu7gNl1I4,497190,500480,going into that opening of different gender
SoNu7gNl1I4,500480,503260,"and also races, all that opening."
SoNu7gNl1I4,503260,505503,"The majority are for the opening,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,505503,508690,and the minority is the ones that are against it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,508690,509743,That is a big change.
SoNu7gNl1I4,520990,524060,"I think that the clientele in the past two years,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,524060,528100,"it's gone from being a very Western clientele actually,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,528100,531540,"and one really rooted and based in the United States,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,531540,533102,to being much more global.
SoNu7gNl1I4,537570,541040,Creativity needs to be balanced with business.
SoNu7gNl1I4,541040,544699,The most crucial decision any fashion CEO makes
SoNu7gNl1I4,544700,546610,is the selection of a creative director
SoNu7gNl1I4,546610,550110,"who can inform the entire universe of the brand,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,550110,552470,"not just the collections and the clothes,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,552470,555300,"but also the stores, the advertising,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,555300,558523,"and in the digital age, the social media strategy."
SoNu7gNl1I4,559630,562210,The legendary designer Karl Lagerfeld
SoNu7gNl1I4,562210,566130,was creative director at Fendi for more than half a century
SoNu7gNl1I4,566130,568670,"and had a lifelong contract with Chanel,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,568670,572360,where he worked until he died in 2019.
SoNu7gNl1I4,572360,575680,"But more recently, designers have been switching sides"
SoNu7gNl1I4,575680,577180,"at a fast clip,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,577180,580050,akin to soccer managers in transfer season
SoNu7gNl1I4,580050,582000,netting the right striker.
SoNu7gNl1I4,582000,583450,"Although in this game,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,583450,586670,"when talents transfer between historic houses,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,586670,589829,it's known to insiders as musical chairs.
SoNu7gNl1I4,589830,592400,When Balenciaga's parent company Kering
SoNu7gNl1I4,592400,594870,"acquired the brand in 2001,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,594870,599290,it was doing only $17.3 million in revenue.
SoNu7gNl1I4,599290,601660,That has all changed.
SoNu7gNl1I4,601660,604870,"Analysts say it's doing almost 2 billion Euros in sales,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,604870,606450,"which makes it one of the biggest,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,606450,608833,most important fashion houses in the world.
SoNu7gNl1I4,609700,611530,A large part of this success
SoNu7gNl1I4,611530,614960,"is down to its creative director, Demna Gvasalia,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,614960,618150,"who has injected his dystopian vision into the brand,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,618150,621840,"with experience honed at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,621840,624723,"Maison Martin Margiela, and Louis Vuitton."
SoNu7gNl1I4,625960,629480,"From Georgian refugee to master fashion disruptor,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,629480,631360,Demna is part of a group of designers
SoNu7gNl1I4,631360,634350,including Virgil Abloh and Kim Jones
SoNu7gNl1I4,634350,636120,who brought the streetwear phenomenon
SoNu7gNl1I4,636120,639020,to the highest levels of European fashion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,639020,640160,He's the creative mind
SoNu7gNl1I4,640160,642730,behind Balenciaga's first couture show
SoNu7gNl1I4,642730,644373,in more than 50 years.
SoNu7gNl1I4,645260,647160,"This is the 50th couture collection,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,647160,651600,because Mr. Balenciaga himself did 49 collections.
SoNu7gNl1I4,651600,653250,"So this is the 50th collection,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,653250,657270,it's Demna's first couture collection.
SoNu7gNl1I4,657270,659740,"And so it's probably the most important,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,659740,663550,"most anticipated moment of this Couture Week,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,663550,665500,and we're getting the first look at it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,668525,669913,It's like the gate to couture.
SoNu7gNl1I4,669913,670803,That's correct.
SoNu7gNl1I4,678200,680840,"So, they're about to start the fittings."
SoNu7gNl1I4,680840,683940,They have to allocate which model is gonna wear which look.
SoNu7gNl1I4,683940,686070,But now the fittings have also become a moment
SoNu7gNl1I4,686070,688090,to capture content to share later.
SoNu7gNl1I4,688090,691945,So there's a whole photograph setup as well.
SoNu7gNl1I4,691945,693780,"And you can just tell by the energy in here,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,693780,696940,there's lots of anticipation because some of the looks
SoNu7gNl1I4,696940,698880,are being revealed for the first time.
SoNu7gNl1I4,698880,700410,Nobody in the whole world
SoNu7gNl1I4,700410,703129,outside this building has seen this collection.
SoNu7gNl1I4,704750,706280,"An emigre himself,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,706280,709510,Cristobal Balenciaga shaped the fashion scene
SoNu7gNl1I4,709510,711780,"through the 1940s and '50s,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,711780,714280,"with his sculptural masterpieces,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,714280,717400,until he shuttered the house in 1968.
SoNu7gNl1I4,717400,718430,How are you feeling?
SoNu7gNl1I4,718430,719630,"Good, very excited,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,719630,721353,"now it's the moment actually, the hardest one,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,721353,723350,where I cannot change anything anymore.
SoNu7gNl1I4,723350,724600,I can just shorten the lengths-
SoNu7gNl1I4,724600,725639,So you're not one of the ones
SoNu7gNl1I4,725640,727084,who changes things the night before?
SoNu7gNl1I4,727084,728910,"No, but in couture also, you can't."
SoNu7gNl1I4,728910,730139,Okay.
SoNu7gNl1I4,730140,732930,Our interview takes place in the recently restored
SoNu7gNl1I4,732930,735170,"Balenciaga couture salon,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,735170,739709,"where tomorrow, in a show with just 128 attendees,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,739710,742810,"including Kanye West, Lewis Hamilton"
SoNu7gNl1I4,742810,746496,"and Kering chairman and CEO Francois-Henri Pinault,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,746496,749610,"Demna will pay homage to the brand's history,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,749610,753513,"underscoring, the intimacy and rarity of haute couture."
SoNu7gNl1I4,754380,757963,So I wanted to start with where we are right now.
SoNu7gNl1I4,758850,762339,Can you tell me what this place signifies
SoNu7gNl1I4,762340,764380,to the house of Balenciaga?
SoNu7gNl1I4,764380,766640,"This actual space salon, where we're sitting,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,766640,770860,is where the couture clients would come
SoNu7gNl1I4,770860,773709,during the Cristobal Balenciaga era.
SoNu7gNl1I4,773710,775110,Originally it was the salon.
SoNu7gNl1I4,775110,775943,"It was the salon,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,775943,779480,this is the place where the founder of this house would come
SoNu7gNl1I4,779480,783540,and create his legacy that we're living through today.
SoNu7gNl1I4,783540,785009,"It's symbolic, I don't know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,785010,789600,it's symbolic for my showing respect to the legacy
SoNu7gNl1I4,789600,792120,that I'm lucky enough to be in the middle of.
SoNu7gNl1I4,792120,794240,And now the couture has been in making
SoNu7gNl1I4,794240,796162,for over one year almost.
SoNu7gNl1I4,797470,799720,"And it's the first live event that we're going to have,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,799720,801439,even if the audience is going to be
SoNu7gNl1I4,801440,803210,quite restricted and small.
SoNu7gNl1I4,803210,806733,What is your vision for Balenciaga couture?
SoNu7gNl1I4,808150,810310,"I would say rather than my vision,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,810310,815310,my mission in couture is to actually give it a second life.
SoNu7gNl1I4,815690,817980,"I heard people saying couture is dead, who needs it?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,817980,820399,"You know, it's completely useless."
SoNu7gNl1I4,820400,823593,"But I'm afraid of what's going to be in 20, 30 years."
SoNu7gNl1I4,825480,827300,After bursting onto the fashion scene
SoNu7gNl1I4,827300,829490,"with the brand collective Vetements,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,829490,833060,Demna took the helm of Balenciaga in 2015
SoNu7gNl1I4,833060,835740,"as part of a radical modernization,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,835740,837490,"including the Triple S,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,837490,840250,which set afire the ugly sneaker trend
SoNu7gNl1I4,840250,842450,and helped Balenciaga surpass
SoNu7gNl1I4,842450,845940,"a billion dollars in revenue in 2019,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,845940,848860,spawning a thousand copycats.
SoNu7gNl1I4,848860,852160,"His fashion shows have been as disruptive as his designs,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,852160,854889,set in an enormous television studio
SoNu7gNl1I4,854890,858500,on the outskirts of the Peripherique in Paris.
SoNu7gNl1I4,858500,862470,He's cast runway models outside the traditional mold.
SoNu7gNl1I4,862470,865069,"I like the fact that there's boys at a couture show,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,865070,866950,"that's on your show, right?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,866950,870960,"And the Balenciaga couture show this week will feature men,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,870960,873300,"women, and non-binary people,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,873300,876050,something that has not been part of traditional couture
SoNu7gNl1I4,877300,880490,Karl Lagerfeld occasionally featured men's couture
SoNu7gNl1I4,880490,882070,"on his Chanel runways,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,882070,885140,but it was not made available for sale.
SoNu7gNl1I4,885140,887140,I feel like talking about gender
SoNu7gNl1I4,887140,889560,"is like talking about the day before yesterday's news,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,889560,891160,"you know, we shouldn't even be talking about it."
SoNu7gNl1I4,891160,892940,"We should just be living it, in fashion."
SoNu7gNl1I4,892940,896570,"And for me, the fact that you saw boys and girls"
SoNu7gNl1I4,896570,899670,and non-binary people in my cast.
SoNu7gNl1I4,899670,901970,"Giving couture to men, for example,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,901970,903300,for me they had to pay back some.
SoNu7gNl1I4,903300,904560,"And so I wanted them to wear heels,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,904560,906070,and to feel how it is to wear heels
SoNu7gNl1I4,906070,909513,and to see what it does to different type of guys.
SoNu7gNl1I4,910870,912210,"Does some of this motivation,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,912210,915710,"to bring this into kind of mainstream fashion and culture,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,915710,918280,come from having grown up in Georgia
SoNu7gNl1I4,919200,922030,during the time of the Soviet Union?
SoNu7gNl1I4,922030,924740,That wasn't a place where conversations
SoNu7gNl1I4,924740,929320,"around gender identity, homosexuality-"
SoNu7gNl1I4,929320,932346,"So, I think there is a direct link, for me personally,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,932346,935546,"with the culture in which I grew and don't ask, don't tell,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,935546,937470,"I mean, officially there are no gays in Georgia,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,937470,941180,"you know, so obviously it was a taboo subject."
SoNu7gNl1I4,941180,945180,"I mean, I've been more terrorized by homophobia"
SoNu7gNl1I4,945180,946470,"than the actual civil war,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,946470,947970,"so I feel like it is in me,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,947970,950120,it's something that I have to do.
SoNu7gNl1I4,950120,953470,It's almost like a therapy in a way to do that.
SoNu7gNl1I4,953470,955769,"And since fashion is the mirror of our times,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,955770,958620,"I think it is kind of part of my job, almost."
SoNu7gNl1I4,958620,959750,Yeah.
SoNu7gNl1I4,959750,961540,What's your take on what we should learn
SoNu7gNl1I4,961540,965803,from the last 16 months of pause?
SoNu7gNl1I4,967010,969530,"You know, I like to raise questions through my work,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,969530,972380,"you know, sustainability, like raising questions"
SoNu7gNl1I4,972380,973890,about consumption in general.
SoNu7gNl1I4,973890,975580,"I mean, it's kind of ironic,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,975580,977040,because I'm in the middle of the system
SoNu7gNl1I4,977040,979329,that encourages the consumption.
SoNu7gNl1I4,979330,981550,"But what I'm trying to do, bringing couture to it,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,981550,983110,is actually start a conversation
SoNu7gNl1I4,983110,984940,about thinking twice about consumption.
SoNu7gNl1I4,984940,988110,"I think, you know, couture for me"
SoNu7gNl1I4,988110,990620,has something very modern in its concept
SoNu7gNl1I4,990620,993400,because we only produce what somebody orders.
SoNu7gNl1I4,993400,996340,"So this is like the most sustainable way of consuming,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,996340,999000,but obviously the industry cannot live on that.
SoNu7gNl1I4,999000,1001680,"But I think it is also about finding that balance, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1001680,1004130,"this pandemic made me, before pandemic,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1004130,1005050,I never thought about it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1005050,1007279,"I was like a hamster in a wheel just making stuff,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1007280,1008390,and making it and making it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1008390,1013390,"But the irony is, you need to sell mountains of sneakers"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1013400,1018280,in order to be able to sustain both this couture collection
SoNu7gNl1I4,1018280,1019380,"and the business, right?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1019380,1020600,You called it balance.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1020600,1022779,"I think it is balance, I think it's balance,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1022780,1026360,and it's also understanding what people want from fashion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1026360,1028140,"I think that's the good starting point,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1028140,1029530,because they don't want all of that stuff
SoNu7gNl1I4,1029530,1030490,that is being produced.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1030490,1032470,"They don't need it, they don't want it."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1032470,1034049,"And to be honest, they don't care about it."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1034050,1038100,"Fashion has become too busy to notice that, you know."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1038100,1041390,"The industry, and I feel that pandemic gave that, somehow,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1041390,1044959,possibility to take a step back and to kind of look at it
SoNu7gNl1I4,1044959,1047789,from objectively and to understand
SoNu7gNl1I4,1047790,1049140,you don't need all of that.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1050890,1053740,Recognizing the impact fashion has on the planet
SoNu7gNl1I4,1053740,1055760,is a step forward.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1055760,1058060,"But the scale of the problem is vast,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1058060,1061840,and the necessary change can feel intimidating.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1061840,1065330,"Some designers prefer to work outside of the big houses,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1065330,1067490,turning down lucrative offers
SoNu7gNl1I4,1067490,1069763,instead to focus on their own brands.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1070890,1074690,"One such designer is the rising star of Paris fashion,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1074690,1077376,whose studio in the 19th arrondissement
SoNu7gNl1I4,1077376,1079440,is bursting with old garments
SoNu7gNl1I4,1079440,1081340,that she repurposes to create
SoNu7gNl1I4,1081340,1083362,her highly acclaimed collections.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1084347,1085180,Wow.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1085180,1088080,I met with Marine Serre to get her take
SoNu7gNl1I4,1088080,1090519,on how the pandemic is changing fashion
SoNu7gNl1I4,1090520,1095160,and to learn if that change is happening fast enough.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1095160,1097330,"So this is our upcycle room,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1097330,1100440,where we are making garment from regenerated fabric.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1100440,1103220,"We take these from warehouses, it's all waste,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1103220,1105620,and already used garment.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1105620,1107360,But do they just sell it in bulk?
SoNu7gNl1I4,1107360,1110720,"Yeah, so they have like tons and tons and tons of garment,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1110720,1112150,"when you enter into this place,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1112150,1115210,you realize also how fashion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,1115210,1119130,have been like producing so much the last 50 years.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1119130,1121660,"So basically, this is our past, I mean,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1121660,1124010,"this is the past of fashion and we are like,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1124010,1128110,taking piece of it and selecting into that
SoNu7gNl1I4,1128110,1129220,to make new garments.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1129220,1131480,"And then no garment is the same either, right?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1131480,1134500,Because every piece is different.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1134500,1135920,"All of them, they are unique."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1135920,1139140,And the only thing that repeats is the process of making.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1139140,1140560,"But indeed the piece itself,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1140560,1143710,"like if this will be on the back of your shirt,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1143710,1145450,all of the shirt would be different.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1145450,1146519,Right.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1146520,1148210,"It was Marine's grandfather,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1148210,1150679,"a collector and secondhand dealer,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1150680,1153233,who first taught her the value of vintage.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1154440,1157909,Looking at fashion through an ethical and sustainable lens
SoNu7gNl1I4,1157910,1160910,allowed Marine to foresee many of the issues
SoNu7gNl1I4,1160910,1164003,that the industry is only just starting to wake up to.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1165100,1166750,"You know, and you clearly feel very deeply"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1166750,1168350,about the state of the world.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1168350,1172620,"You think deeply about the climate and the environment,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1172620,1175290,but you're now saying you feel optimistic.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1175290,1177540,"Well, I think before it was more about"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1177540,1179779,"ringing the bell, alarming people,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1179779,1182310,"because like in the fashion industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1182310,1186350,no one was looking at that and I was also working
SoNu7gNl1I4,1186350,1187183,"for this industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1187183,1191817,so I do not want it to be a part of just being there
SoNu7gNl1I4,1191817,1193750,"and making one more skirt,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1193750,1196120,"you know, I was hoping that maybe, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1196120,1198100,some other people of the fashion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,1198100,1199380,were thinking about that too.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1199380,1201680,"We really have to think about, yeah,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1201680,1203560,the environment that we are living in
SoNu7gNl1I4,1203560,1205840,and the planet that we are destroying every day.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1205840,1207779,"So if I'm there, I have to,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1207780,1211720,at least making a small change.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1211720,1215110,So what is luxury to you and what is that luxury customer
SoNu7gNl1I4,1215110,1218220,"that you are appealing to, what are they looking for?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1218220,1220590,I believe that you can feel it when you touch it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1220590,1223130,"I think people that are in fashion for long, they will know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1223130,1225440,you know how this thing is stitch.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1225440,1227549,"And even if you don't know like this old thing,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1227550,1229420,"you will feel it, like for me,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1229420,1232540,it's really joyful when I take a cushion cover
SoNu7gNl1I4,1232540,1236730,and then I can transform it into a shirt that look cool.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1236730,1238960,"I'm like, yeah, that's nice."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1238960,1241289,What is the goal of the company?
SoNu7gNl1I4,1241290,1243290,I think the goal of the company
SoNu7gNl1I4,1243290,1248090,"is to question the fashion industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1248090,1250669,try to resolve some of the question.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1250670,1253660,"I mean, basically every day we are doing that"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1253660,1256880,"and it's to make an ecosystem,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1256880,1260163,a new ecosystem kind of exist.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1261430,1265170,A fashion business does not succeed on aesthetics alone.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1265170,1266170,"Now more than ever,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1266170,1269870,those designs need to be rooted in clear values.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1269870,1271750,"Sustainability, for me,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1271750,1274510,"it has become a very personal thing, really,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1274510,1277250,just maybe doing couture is my way
SoNu7gNl1I4,1277250,1281393,"taking a minute of silence, almost, to reflect."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1282250,1285200,This is why the show will be in a full silence.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1285200,1286033,No music?
SoNu7gNl1I4,1286033,1287039,"There will be no music, this is the first time,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1287040,1289770,I never showed my work in silence.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1289770,1290603,Wow.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1295630,1298310,"That minute of silence, it's very symbolic"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1298310,1301010,"from what I just told you about fashion as an industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1301010,1303310,"all the white noise, things that don't matter."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1305520,1306970,I've seen designers injecting
SoNu7gNl1I4,1306970,1309309,more of their personal values into their designs
SoNu7gNl1I4,1309310,1312840,and asking provocative questions about fashion
SoNu7gNl1I4,1312840,1314730,and its role in the world.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1314730,1316870,Marine and Demna are asking how fashion
SoNu7gNl1I4,1316870,1320850,"can more positively impact the people in our communities,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1320850,1324553,"the societies we live in, and the planet we all share."
vid,start,end,text
SoNu7gNl1I4,1550,4963,What we wear says a lot about who we are.
SoNu7gNl1I4,4963,9010,Yet fashion is also a $2.5 trillion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,9010,11103,that touches everyone on Earth.
SoNu7gNl1I4,12750,14250,I'm Imran Amed.
SoNu7gNl1I4,14250,16890,I first started trying to make sense of the fashion business
SoNu7gNl1I4,16890,21020,"15 years ago, as it was being transformed by technology,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,21020,24540,"globalization, and shifting consumer values."
SoNu7gNl1I4,24540,27368,And so stuff like this would just end up in a landfill.
SoNu7gNl1I4,27368,28584,Yeah.
SoNu7gNl1I4,28584,31542,Now I'm on a journey to see how fashion is recalibrating
SoNu7gNl1I4,31542,35895,after the pandemic to balance profit with purpose.
SoNu7gNl1I4,35895,38120,This is the Business of Fashion Show.
SoNu7gNl1I4,38120,42079,"Join me to discover how fashion shapes, business, culture,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,42080,43330,"and identity,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,43330,46263,and to meet the people forging fashion's future.
SoNu7gNl1I4,52810,54180,"Well, I'm back here in Paris"
SoNu7gNl1I4,54180,57360,for the first time in 16 months.
SoNu7gNl1I4,57360,59960,And it's the first time the global fashion community
SoNu7gNl1I4,59960,64712,is really getting together since March 2020.
SoNu7gNl1I4,65620,68530,"It's Haute Couture Week, the most exclusive,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,68530,71460,most elaborate and most creative event
SoNu7gNl1I4,71460,72913,on the fashion calendar.
SoNu7gNl1I4,74520,77070,"This is a world of rules and traditions,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,77070,80280,of exquisite workmanship and high net worth clients
SoNu7gNl1I4,80280,82500,able to pay six figures for a gown.
SoNu7gNl1I4,82500,84090,Do you buy couture?
SoNu7gNl1I4,84090,84923,Absolutely.
SoNu7gNl1I4,84923,85756,Yeah.
SoNu7gNl1I4,85756,88229,Yet the trailblazing designers we're about to meet
SoNu7gNl1I4,88230,89993,may not be what you expect.
SoNu7gNl1I4,90970,93990,"Among them, a true disruptor in fashion,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,93990,96710,the man who made a billion dollar industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,96710,98320,out of ugly sneakers
SoNu7gNl1I4,98320,100920,is staging Balenciaga's first couture show
SoNu7gNl1I4,100920,102137,in over 50 years.
SoNu7gNl1I4,102137,103410,How are you?
SoNu7gNl1I4,103410,105380,We had an exclusive preview.
SoNu7gNl1I4,105380,108369,"Couture, for me, has something very modern"
SoNu7gNl1I4,108370,111460,in its concept because we only produce what somebody orders.
SoNu7gNl1I4,111460,114280,This is like the most sustainable way of consuming.
SoNu7gNl1I4,114280,116360,"And the rising star of Paris,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,116360,119380,whose highly creative collections placed the planet
SoNu7gNl1I4,119380,122090,"before profit, embedding sustainability"
SoNu7gNl1I4,122090,123700,into her design process.
SoNu7gNl1I4,123700,125969,We really have to think about the planet
SoNu7gNl1I4,125970,127650,"that we are destroying every day,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,127650,129920,"so I was hoping that maybe, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,129920,131910,some other people of the fashion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,131910,133560,were thinking about that.
SoNu7gNl1I4,133560,135300,But to really understand what's happening
SoNu7gNl1I4,135300,136810,"in Paris this week,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,136810,140323,it's important to take stock of the last 18 months.
SoNu7gNl1I4,143920,147750,2020 was the worst year in the history of modern luxury.
SoNu7gNl1I4,147750,151090,"Before that, annual revenues for the luxury fashion market"
SoNu7gNl1I4,151090,153386,topped $380 billion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,155530,157260,More than two thirds of growth was buoyed
SoNu7gNl1I4,157260,162260,"by the Chinese, at home, but especially as tourists abroad."
SoNu7gNl1I4,162490,165350,"The lion's share of revenues came from accessories,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,165350,168873,"especially handbags, with designer sneakers catching up."
SoNu7gNl1I4,170870,174159,"Then, Wuhan, China locked down."
SoNu7gNl1I4,174160,178250,Covid hit Europe during the 2020 spring fashion show season.
SoNu7gNl1I4,178250,180140,Giorgio Armani livestreamed his show
SoNu7gNl1I4,180140,182550,"from an empty theater in Milan,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,182550,184480,"but other brands forged on,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,184480,187252,with shows packed full of fashion insiders.
SoNu7gNl1I4,188430,191120,"In a global business so interconnected,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,191120,194530,unforeseen consequences of the pandemic came to light.
SoNu7gNl1I4,194530,197120,Delayed weddings led to canceled embroidery orders
SoNu7gNl1I4,197120,198400,"out of Paris,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,198400,199680,threatening the livelihoods
SoNu7gNl1I4,199680,202254,of the Karigar artisans of India.
SoNu7gNl1I4,202254,205670,Luxury revenues plunged by more than 20%.
SoNu7gNl1I4,205670,207440,Companies cut costs.
SoNu7gNl1I4,207440,209330,"But by the end of 2020,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,209330,213043,Covid-19 had still devastated industry profitability.
SoNu7gNl1I4,215510,217409,"Fashion was forced to adapt,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,217410,221260,using technology to drive creative and business innovation.
SoNu7gNl1I4,221260,222980,The fashion business was re-imagined
SoNu7gNl1I4,222980,226823,"through distance selling, online films and virtual fashion."
SoNu7gNl1I4,228750,231120,"The luxury industry bounced back,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,231120,234659,"dominated by the mega brands, Hermes and Chanel,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,234660,237953,"and the mega groups, LVMH, Kering and Richemont."
SoNu7gNl1I4,239880,241980,By the first half of 2021
SoNu7gNl1I4,241980,243720,revenues for some of the biggest names
SoNu7gNl1I4,243720,247220,were up as much as 40% on pre-pandemic levels
SoNu7gNl1I4,247220,249003,delivering record profits.
SoNu7gNl1I4,250170,252069,"From an economic perspective,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,252070,255130,these super winners are emerging from the pandemic
SoNu7gNl1I4,255130,256233,even stronger.
SoNu7gNl1I4,257840,260810,"Now, there is a reawakening in Paris,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,260810,263780,the global capital of luxury fashion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,263780,265700,It's a historical echo.
SoNu7gNl1I4,265700,268630,The last time fashion burst back to life here
SoNu7gNl1I4,268630,270350,"was after World War Two,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,270350,274800,"with the sensation that was Christian Dior's ""New Look""."
SoNu7gNl1I4,274800,276919,It will take more than a new silhouette
SoNu7gNl1I4,276920,279770,to transform the fashion industry now.
SoNu7gNl1I4,279770,282729,"I mean, the big question for me is, really,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,282730,284790,where does the industry go from here?
SoNu7gNl1I4,284790,287010,"And you know, how does it need to adapt and change"
SoNu7gNl1I4,287010,290490,to be kind of fit for this new world
SoNu7gNl1I4,290490,291490,that we're entering?
SoNu7gNl1I4,292380,294920,"To find out more about this reawakening,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,294920,296530,I met with a fashion insider
SoNu7gNl1I4,296530,300093,with his finger on the creative pulse of Parisian fashion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,300960,301793,Pierre!
SoNu7gNl1I4,301793,303380,"Hey Imran, how are you?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,303380,304350,"Good, how are you?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,304350,305430,I'm good.
SoNu7gNl1I4,305430,308979,"Pierre Alexandre M'Pel√©, also known as Pam Boy,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,308980,310830,caught the ear of fashion insiders
SoNu7gNl1I4,310830,313580,for his honest online fashion critiques.
SoNu7gNl1I4,313580,314629,Is that an earring?
SoNu7gNl1I4,314630,318290,"Yeah, it's Alan Crocetti, it's like a little rose."
SoNu7gNl1I4,318290,321490,"I was like, fashion moment."
SoNu7gNl1I4,321490,324729,"Now, he collaborates with the respected fashion editor,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,324730,326930,"Katie Grand, at Perfect,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,326930,330302,a fashion media company founded amid the pandemic.
SoNu7gNl1I4,331290,333880,"What is La Perle, like, why did you pick this place?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,333880,335170,Who comes here?
SoNu7gNl1I4,335170,339310,"Everyone, it's you know, designers and, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,339310,341169,"we always joke about, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,341170,342590,dress well and come to La Perle
SoNu7gNl1I4,342590,345090,and you'll get an internship or you'll find a job.
SoNu7gNl1I4,346640,348920,"In the 1960s or '70s,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,348920,352900,"there was no luxury industry, you know?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,352900,356560,"But now luxury is this global industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,356560,358190,and what's the role of luxury?
SoNu7gNl1I4,358190,360240,"I mean, I think the role of luxury"
SoNu7gNl1I4,360240,363539,is to preserve craftsmanship.
SoNu7gNl1I4,363540,368260,"We tend to, you know, look down on manual work and craft,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,368260,369960,"and I think luxury,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,369960,372470,"if anything, has always been about that."
SoNu7gNl1I4,372470,375710,Going back to Louis XIV in France
SoNu7gNl1I4,375710,377639,"and how he developed, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,377640,380933,the French fashion industry as we know it today.
SoNu7gNl1I4,382490,384800,As you think about the fashion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,384800,386970,"we want to create for the future,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,386970,390080,do you feel like there's actually real change happening
SoNu7gNl1I4,390080,391970,or is it at the surface?
SoNu7gNl1I4,391970,395380,"I mean, I feel like changing the structures of power"
SoNu7gNl1I4,395380,398160,"in the industry and how they interconnect,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,398160,400460,I feel like companies need to take risks.
SoNu7gNl1I4,400460,402250,They need diversity and inclusion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,402250,404020,I feel like fashion is a global conversation.
SoNu7gNl1I4,404020,405919,"Everyone is concerned, you know."
SoNu7gNl1I4,405920,407260,I don't think that would have happened
SoNu7gNl1I4,407260,408820,if it weren't for the pandemic.
SoNu7gNl1I4,408820,411240,"I mean, Paris felt weird, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,411240,413330,between the pandemic and the whole conversation
SoNu7gNl1I4,413330,414163,"of Black Lives Matter,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,414163,416490,"which was something very new in France,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,416490,418410,I feel like as soon as we started talking
SoNu7gNl1I4,418410,420380,"about systemic racism in the industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,420380,423200,a lot of people reached out to me and came to realize that
SoNu7gNl1I4,423200,427450,"fashion is also about how do we want society to be,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,427450,430250,"for example, in the '60s with the sexual revolution,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,430250,432380,"and women started wearing miniskirt,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,432380,435610,"that was fashion changing society and shaping society,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,435610,439689,"and you know, pushing new ideas about womanhood"
SoNu7gNl1I4,439690,441330,"and what a woman could be,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,441330,442569,"and now with menswear,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,442570,445030,"there's been a lot of conversation about masculinity,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,445030,446460,"what it means to be a man,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,446460,450479,and I think that it's questions that fashion can answer
SoNu7gNl1I4,450480,452810,"fashion is probably the best, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,452810,455050,medium to answer those questions.
SoNu7gNl1I4,455050,457340,"I always say, it's time to open the windows."
SoNu7gNl1I4,457340,462340,"We need a fresh breeze of newness to kind of, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,462490,464633,swipe through to the industry.
SoNu7gNl1I4,467020,470419,It really does feel like change is the watchword here.
SoNu7gNl1I4,470420,473350,As I caught up with top designers and creatives
SoNu7gNl1I4,473350,475620,in town for Paris Fashion Week.
SoNu7gNl1I4,475620,477160,"You know, everyone was talking about a reset,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,477160,479250,are we going back to where we were?
SoNu7gNl1I4,479250,482340,"I hope not personally, but I mean, change is a subtle one."
SoNu7gNl1I4,482340,483480,"I mean, the truth of the matter is,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,483480,487717,we've got centuries and decades of this fashion world
SoNu7gNl1I4,487717,491510,and fashion business and hopefully the mentalities evolve.
SoNu7gNl1I4,491510,493140,And I don't think we should go back completely
SoNu7gNl1I4,493140,494113,to where we were.
SoNu7gNl1I4,495360,497189,"There is like, it's a big movement"
SoNu7gNl1I4,497190,500480,going into that opening of different gender
SoNu7gNl1I4,500480,503260,"and also races, all that opening."
SoNu7gNl1I4,503260,505503,"The majority are for the opening,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,505503,508690,and the minority is the ones that are against it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,508690,509743,That is a big change.
SoNu7gNl1I4,520990,524060,"I think that the clientele in the past two years,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,524060,528100,"it's gone from being a very Western clientele actually,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,528100,531540,"and one really rooted and based in the United States,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,531540,533102,to being much more global.
SoNu7gNl1I4,537570,541040,Creativity needs to be balanced with business.
SoNu7gNl1I4,541040,544699,The most crucial decision any fashion CEO makes
SoNu7gNl1I4,544700,546610,is the selection of a creative director
SoNu7gNl1I4,546610,550110,"who can inform the entire universe of the brand,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,550110,552470,"not just the collections and the clothes,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,552470,555300,"but also the stores, the advertising,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,555300,558523,"and in the digital age, the social media strategy."
SoNu7gNl1I4,559630,562210,The legendary designer Karl Lagerfeld
SoNu7gNl1I4,562210,566130,was creative director at Fendi for more than half a century
SoNu7gNl1I4,566130,568670,"and had a lifelong contract with Chanel,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,568670,572360,where he worked until he died in 2019.
SoNu7gNl1I4,572360,575680,"But more recently, designers have been switching sides"
SoNu7gNl1I4,575680,577180,"at a fast clip,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,577180,580050,akin to soccer managers in transfer season
SoNu7gNl1I4,580050,582000,netting the right striker.
SoNu7gNl1I4,582000,583450,"Although in this game,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,583450,586670,"when talents transfer between historic houses,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,586670,589829,it's known to insiders as musical chairs.
SoNu7gNl1I4,589830,592400,When Balenciaga's parent company Kering
SoNu7gNl1I4,592400,594870,"acquired the brand in 2001,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,594870,599290,it was doing only $17.3 million in revenue.
SoNu7gNl1I4,599290,601660,That has all changed.
SoNu7gNl1I4,601660,604870,"Analysts say it's doing almost 2 billion Euros in sales,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,604870,606450,"which makes it one of the biggest,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,606450,608833,most important fashion houses in the world.
SoNu7gNl1I4,609700,611530,A large part of this success
SoNu7gNl1I4,611530,614960,"is down to its creative director, Demna Gvasalia,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,614960,618150,"who has injected his dystopian vision into the brand,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,618150,621840,"with experience honed at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,621840,624723,"Maison Martin Margiela, and Louis Vuitton."
SoNu7gNl1I4,625960,629480,"From Georgian refugee to master fashion disruptor,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,629480,631360,Demna is part of a group of designers
SoNu7gNl1I4,631360,634350,including Virgil Abloh and Kim Jones
SoNu7gNl1I4,634350,636120,who brought the streetwear phenomenon
SoNu7gNl1I4,636120,639020,to the highest levels of European fashion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,639020,640160,He's the creative mind
SoNu7gNl1I4,640160,642730,behind Balenciaga's first couture show
SoNu7gNl1I4,642730,644373,in more than 50 years.
SoNu7gNl1I4,645260,647160,"This is the 50th couture collection,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,647160,651600,because Mr. Balenciaga himself did 49 collections.
SoNu7gNl1I4,651600,653250,"So this is the 50th collection,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,653250,657270,it's Demna's first couture collection.
SoNu7gNl1I4,657270,659740,"And so it's probably the most important,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,659740,663550,"most anticipated moment of this Couture Week,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,663550,665500,and we're getting the first look at it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,668525,669913,It's like the gate to couture.
SoNu7gNl1I4,669913,670803,That's correct.
SoNu7gNl1I4,678200,680840,"So, they're about to start the fittings."
SoNu7gNl1I4,680840,683940,They have to allocate which model is gonna wear which look.
SoNu7gNl1I4,683940,686070,But now the fittings have also become a moment
SoNu7gNl1I4,686070,688090,to capture content to share later.
SoNu7gNl1I4,688090,691945,So there's a whole photograph setup as well.
SoNu7gNl1I4,691945,693780,"And you can just tell by the energy in here,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,693780,696940,there's lots of anticipation because some of the looks
SoNu7gNl1I4,696940,698880,are being revealed for the first time.
SoNu7gNl1I4,698880,700410,Nobody in the whole world
SoNu7gNl1I4,700410,703129,outside this building has seen this collection.
SoNu7gNl1I4,704750,706280,"An emigre himself,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,706280,709510,Cristobal Balenciaga shaped the fashion scene
SoNu7gNl1I4,709510,711780,"through the 1940s and '50s,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,711780,714280,"with his sculptural masterpieces,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,714280,717400,until he shuttered the house in 1968.
SoNu7gNl1I4,717400,718430,How are you feeling?
SoNu7gNl1I4,718430,719630,"Good, very excited,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,719630,721353,"now it's the moment actually, the hardest one,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,721353,723350,where I cannot change anything anymore.
SoNu7gNl1I4,723350,724600,I can just shorten the lengths-
SoNu7gNl1I4,724600,725639,So you're not one of the ones
SoNu7gNl1I4,725640,727084,who changes things the night before?
SoNu7gNl1I4,727084,728910,"No, but in couture also, you can't."
SoNu7gNl1I4,728910,730139,Okay.
SoNu7gNl1I4,730140,732930,Our interview takes place in the recently restored
SoNu7gNl1I4,732930,735170,"Balenciaga couture salon,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,735170,739709,"where tomorrow, in a show with just 128 attendees,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,739710,742810,"including Kanye West, Lewis Hamilton"
SoNu7gNl1I4,742810,746496,"and Kering chairman and CEO Francois-Henri Pinault,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,746496,749610,"Demna will pay homage to the brand's history,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,749610,753513,"underscoring, the intimacy and rarity of haute couture."
SoNu7gNl1I4,754380,757963,So I wanted to start with where we are right now.
SoNu7gNl1I4,758850,762339,Can you tell me what this place signifies
SoNu7gNl1I4,762340,764380,to the house of Balenciaga?
SoNu7gNl1I4,764380,766640,"This actual space salon, where we're sitting,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,766640,770860,is where the couture clients would come
SoNu7gNl1I4,770860,773709,during the Cristobal Balenciaga era.
SoNu7gNl1I4,773710,775110,Originally it was the salon.
SoNu7gNl1I4,775110,775943,"It was the salon,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,775943,779480,this is the place where the founder of this house would come
SoNu7gNl1I4,779480,783540,and create his legacy that we're living through today.
SoNu7gNl1I4,783540,785009,"It's symbolic, I don't know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,785010,789600,it's symbolic for my showing respect to the legacy
SoNu7gNl1I4,789600,792120,that I'm lucky enough to be in the middle of.
SoNu7gNl1I4,792120,794240,And now the couture has been in making
SoNu7gNl1I4,794240,796162,for over one year almost.
SoNu7gNl1I4,797470,799720,"And it's the first live event that we're going to have,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,799720,801439,even if the audience is going to be
SoNu7gNl1I4,801440,803210,quite restricted and small.
SoNu7gNl1I4,803210,806733,What is your vision for Balenciaga couture?
SoNu7gNl1I4,808150,810310,"I would say rather than my vision,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,810310,815310,my mission in couture is to actually give it a second life.
SoNu7gNl1I4,815690,817980,"I heard people saying couture is dead, who needs it?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,817980,820399,"You know, it's completely useless."
SoNu7gNl1I4,820400,823593,"But I'm afraid of what's going to be in 20, 30 years."
SoNu7gNl1I4,825480,827300,After bursting onto the fashion scene
SoNu7gNl1I4,827300,829490,"with the brand collective Vetements,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,829490,833060,Demna took the helm of Balenciaga in 2015
SoNu7gNl1I4,833060,835740,"as part of a radical modernization,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,835740,837490,"including the Triple S,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,837490,840250,which set afire the ugly sneaker trend
SoNu7gNl1I4,840250,842450,and helped Balenciaga surpass
SoNu7gNl1I4,842450,845940,"a billion dollars in revenue in 2019,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,845940,848860,spawning a thousand copycats.
SoNu7gNl1I4,848860,852160,"His fashion shows have been as disruptive as his designs,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,852160,854889,set in an enormous television studio
SoNu7gNl1I4,854890,858500,on the outskirts of the Peripherique in Paris.
SoNu7gNl1I4,858500,862470,He's cast runway models outside the traditional mold.
SoNu7gNl1I4,862470,865069,"I like the fact that there's boys at a couture show,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,865070,866950,"that's on your show, right?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,866950,870960,"And the Balenciaga couture show this week will feature men,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,870960,873300,"women, and non-binary people,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,873300,876050,something that has not been part of traditional couture
SoNu7gNl1I4,877300,880490,Karl Lagerfeld occasionally featured men's couture
SoNu7gNl1I4,880490,882070,"on his Chanel runways,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,882070,885140,but it was not made available for sale.
SoNu7gNl1I4,885140,887140,I feel like talking about gender
SoNu7gNl1I4,887140,889560,"is like talking about the day before yesterday's news,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,889560,891160,"you know, we shouldn't even be talking about it."
SoNu7gNl1I4,891160,892940,"We should just be living it, in fashion."
SoNu7gNl1I4,892940,896570,"And for me, the fact that you saw boys and girls"
SoNu7gNl1I4,896570,899670,and non-binary people in my cast.
SoNu7gNl1I4,899670,901970,"Giving couture to men, for example,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,901970,903300,for me they had to pay back some.
SoNu7gNl1I4,903300,904560,"And so I wanted them to wear heels,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,904560,906070,and to feel how it is to wear heels
SoNu7gNl1I4,906070,909513,and to see what it does to different type of guys.
SoNu7gNl1I4,910870,912210,"Does some of this motivation,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,912210,915710,"to bring this into kind of mainstream fashion and culture,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,915710,918280,come from having grown up in Georgia
SoNu7gNl1I4,919200,922030,during the time of the Soviet Union?
SoNu7gNl1I4,922030,924740,That wasn't a place where conversations
SoNu7gNl1I4,924740,929320,"around gender identity, homosexuality-"
SoNu7gNl1I4,929320,932346,"So, I think there is a direct link, for me personally,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,932346,935546,"with the culture in which I grew and don't ask, don't tell,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,935546,937470,"I mean, officially there are no gays in Georgia,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,937470,941180,"you know, so obviously it was a taboo subject."
SoNu7gNl1I4,941180,945180,"I mean, I've been more terrorized by homophobia"
SoNu7gNl1I4,945180,946470,"than the actual civil war,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,946470,947970,"so I feel like it is in me,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,947970,950120,it's something that I have to do.
SoNu7gNl1I4,950120,953470,It's almost like a therapy in a way to do that.
SoNu7gNl1I4,953470,955769,"And since fashion is the mirror of our times,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,955770,958620,"I think it is kind of part of my job, almost."
SoNu7gNl1I4,958620,959750,Yeah.
SoNu7gNl1I4,959750,961540,What's your take on what we should learn
SoNu7gNl1I4,961540,965803,from the last 16 months of pause?
SoNu7gNl1I4,967010,969530,"You know, I like to raise questions through my work,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,969530,972380,"you know, sustainability, like raising questions"
SoNu7gNl1I4,972380,973890,about consumption in general.
SoNu7gNl1I4,973890,975580,"I mean, it's kind of ironic,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,975580,977040,because I'm in the middle of the system
SoNu7gNl1I4,977040,979329,that encourages the consumption.
SoNu7gNl1I4,979330,981550,"But what I'm trying to do, bringing couture to it,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,981550,983110,is actually start a conversation
SoNu7gNl1I4,983110,984940,about thinking twice about consumption.
SoNu7gNl1I4,984940,988110,"I think, you know, couture for me"
SoNu7gNl1I4,988110,990620,has something very modern in its concept
SoNu7gNl1I4,990620,993400,because we only produce what somebody orders.
SoNu7gNl1I4,993400,996340,"So this is like the most sustainable way of consuming,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,996340,999000,but obviously the industry cannot live on that.
SoNu7gNl1I4,999000,1001680,"But I think it is also about finding that balance, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1001680,1004130,"this pandemic made me, before pandemic,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1004130,1005050,I never thought about it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1005050,1007279,"I was like a hamster in a wheel just making stuff,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1007280,1008390,and making it and making it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1008390,1013390,"But the irony is, you need to sell mountains of sneakers"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1013400,1018280,in order to be able to sustain both this couture collection
SoNu7gNl1I4,1018280,1019380,"and the business, right?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1019380,1020600,You called it balance.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1020600,1022779,"I think it is balance, I think it's balance,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1022780,1026360,and it's also understanding what people want from fashion.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1026360,1028140,"I think that's the good starting point,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1028140,1029530,because they don't want all of that stuff
SoNu7gNl1I4,1029530,1030490,that is being produced.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1030490,1032470,"They don't need it, they don't want it."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1032470,1034049,"And to be honest, they don't care about it."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1034050,1038100,"Fashion has become too busy to notice that, you know."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1038100,1041390,"The industry, and I feel that pandemic gave that, somehow,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1041390,1044959,possibility to take a step back and to kind of look at it
SoNu7gNl1I4,1044959,1047789,from objectively and to understand
SoNu7gNl1I4,1047790,1049140,you don't need all of that.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1050890,1053740,Recognizing the impact fashion has on the planet
SoNu7gNl1I4,1053740,1055760,is a step forward.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1055760,1058060,"But the scale of the problem is vast,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1058060,1061840,and the necessary change can feel intimidating.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1061840,1065330,"Some designers prefer to work outside of the big houses,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1065330,1067490,turning down lucrative offers
SoNu7gNl1I4,1067490,1069763,instead to focus on their own brands.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1070890,1074690,"One such designer is the rising star of Paris fashion,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1074690,1077376,whose studio in the 19th arrondissement
SoNu7gNl1I4,1077376,1079440,is bursting with old garments
SoNu7gNl1I4,1079440,1081340,that she repurposes to create
SoNu7gNl1I4,1081340,1083362,her highly acclaimed collections.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1084347,1085180,Wow.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1085180,1088080,I met with Marine Serre to get her take
SoNu7gNl1I4,1088080,1090519,on how the pandemic is changing fashion
SoNu7gNl1I4,1090520,1095160,and to learn if that change is happening fast enough.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1095160,1097330,"So this is our upcycle room,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1097330,1100440,where we are making garment from regenerated fabric.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1100440,1103220,"We take these from warehouses, it's all waste,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1103220,1105620,and already used garment.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1105620,1107360,But do they just sell it in bulk?
SoNu7gNl1I4,1107360,1110720,"Yeah, so they have like tons and tons and tons of garment,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1110720,1112150,"when you enter into this place,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1112150,1115210,you realize also how fashion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,1115210,1119130,have been like producing so much the last 50 years.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1119130,1121660,"So basically, this is our past, I mean,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1121660,1124010,"this is the past of fashion and we are like,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1124010,1128110,taking piece of it and selecting into that
SoNu7gNl1I4,1128110,1129220,to make new garments.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1129220,1131480,"And then no garment is the same either, right?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1131480,1134500,Because every piece is different.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1134500,1135920,"All of them, they are unique."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1135920,1139140,And the only thing that repeats is the process of making.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1139140,1140560,"But indeed the piece itself,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1140560,1143710,"like if this will be on the back of your shirt,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1143710,1145450,all of the shirt would be different.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1145450,1146519,Right.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1146520,1148210,"It was Marine's grandfather,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1148210,1150679,"a collector and secondhand dealer,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1150680,1153233,who first taught her the value of vintage.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1154440,1157909,Looking at fashion through an ethical and sustainable lens
SoNu7gNl1I4,1157910,1160910,allowed Marine to foresee many of the issues
SoNu7gNl1I4,1160910,1164003,that the industry is only just starting to wake up to.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1165100,1166750,"You know, and you clearly feel very deeply"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1166750,1168350,about the state of the world.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1168350,1172620,"You think deeply about the climate and the environment,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1172620,1175290,but you're now saying you feel optimistic.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1175290,1177540,"Well, I think before it was more about"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1177540,1179779,"ringing the bell, alarming people,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1179779,1182310,"because like in the fashion industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1182310,1186350,no one was looking at that and I was also working
SoNu7gNl1I4,1186350,1187183,"for this industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1187183,1191817,so I do not want it to be a part of just being there
SoNu7gNl1I4,1191817,1193750,"and making one more skirt,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1193750,1196120,"you know, I was hoping that maybe, you know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1196120,1198100,some other people of the fashion industry
SoNu7gNl1I4,1198100,1199380,were thinking about that too.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1199380,1201680,"We really have to think about, yeah,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1201680,1203560,the environment that we are living in
SoNu7gNl1I4,1203560,1205840,and the planet that we are destroying every day.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1205840,1207779,"So if I'm there, I have to,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1207780,1211720,at least making a small change.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1211720,1215110,So what is luxury to you and what is that luxury customer
SoNu7gNl1I4,1215110,1218220,"that you are appealing to, what are they looking for?"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1218220,1220590,I believe that you can feel it when you touch it.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1220590,1223130,"I think people that are in fashion for long, they will know,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1223130,1225440,you know how this thing is stitch.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1225440,1227549,"And even if you don't know like this old thing,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1227550,1229420,"you will feel it, like for me,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1229420,1232540,it's really joyful when I take a cushion cover
SoNu7gNl1I4,1232540,1236730,and then I can transform it into a shirt that look cool.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1236730,1238960,"I'm like, yeah, that's nice."
SoNu7gNl1I4,1238960,1241289,What is the goal of the company?
SoNu7gNl1I4,1241290,1243290,I think the goal of the company
SoNu7gNl1I4,1243290,1248090,"is to question the fashion industry,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1248090,1250669,try to resolve some of the question.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1250670,1253660,"I mean, basically every day we are doing that"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1253660,1256880,"and it's to make an ecosystem,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1256880,1260163,a new ecosystem kind of exist.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1261430,1265170,A fashion business does not succeed on aesthetics alone.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1265170,1266170,"Now more than ever,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1266170,1269870,those designs need to be rooted in clear values.
SoNu7gNl1I4,1269870,1271750,"Sustainability, for me,"
SoNu7gNl1I4,1271750,1274510,"it has become a very personal thing, really,"
