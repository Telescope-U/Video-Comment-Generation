jLvKELfgAaI,32080,35040,[Music]
jLvKELfgAaI,35040,38239,so yeah here is my workspace
jLvKELfgAaI,38239,42079,here is totally a mess and i need to fix
jLvKELfgAaI,42079,44399,this immediately so maybe some of the
jLvKELfgAaI,44399,47039,next vlogs i'll clean this thing up and
jLvKELfgAaI,47039,48879,make videos of it and walk you through
jLvKELfgAaI,48879,51920,my setup here
jLvKELfgAaI,54239,57360,i hate to put gloves on this is like
jLvKELfgAaI,57360,59680,most painful job for me i really hate it
jLvKELfgAaI,59680,60480,but
jLvKELfgAaI,60480,62960,it's interesting
jLvKELfgAaI,63160,68479,[Music]
jLvKELfgAaI,68479,71600,i'm wearing small gloves then big one
jLvKELfgAaI,71600,72640,because
jLvKELfgAaI,72640,74640,then i have feeling like i don't have
jLvKELfgAaI,74640,76640,gloves actually so let's go to quick
jLvKELfgAaI,76640,79360,video shall we
jLvKELfgAaI,80560,83200,so first of all this is my airgun and
jLvKELfgAaI,83200,84479,i'm really
jLvKELfgAaI,84479,87840,it helps me a lot to make my work clean
jLvKELfgAaI,87840,88799,so
jLvKELfgAaI,88799,91200,second thing i'm basically always
jLvKELfgAaI,91200,93360,wearing mask but since i'm recording
jLvKELfgAaI,93360,95759,this video and i'm talk to camera i'm
jLvKELfgAaI,95759,98240,not wearing masks it's not it's not that
jLvKELfgAaI,98240,100240,much problem
jLvKELfgAaI,100240,102640,when i'm not using it for a very long
jLvKELfgAaI,102640,103680,time but
jLvKELfgAaI,103680,106799,when you're using spray cans for a long
jLvKELfgAaI,106799,109680,time for a long period then it's really
jLvKELfgAaI,109680,111439,important to have
jLvKELfgAaI,111439,113759,respirators actually
jLvKELfgAaI,113759,116479,so first of all we gonna choose colors
jLvKELfgAaI,116479,118479,what we want
jLvKELfgAaI,118479,121600,i'll try to make
jLvKELfgAaI,123200,125040,i will try to make like
jLvKELfgAaI,125040,126719,two planets that colliding with each
jLvKELfgAaI,126719,127600,other
jLvKELfgAaI,127600,129039,and
jLvKELfgAaI,129039,131120,yeah that would be like for beginning
jLvKELfgAaI,131120,133040,tutorial video i think this would be
jLvKELfgAaI,133040,134319,really interesting
jLvKELfgAaI,134319,135680,so first of all
jLvKELfgAaI,135680,138400,i'm gonna take my stencils for the
jLvKELfgAaI,138400,141400,planets
jLvKELfgAaI,142000,144560,so we choose like two different size
jLvKELfgAaI,144560,145760,size of
jLvKELfgAaI,145760,148760,stencils
jLvKELfgAaI,154060,156560,[Music]
jLvKELfgAaI,156560,159519,and i'm making this holder so i can lift
jLvKELfgAaI,159519,162560,distances later
jLvKELfgAaI,162560,164959,easier
jLvKELfgAaI,168319,171280,there's a reason why i'm not using
jLvKELfgAaI,171280,173120,you probably saw that most of spray
jLvKELfgAaI,173120,175760,paint artists using
jLvKELfgAaI,175760,180319,bowls of or lid of pots for for covering
jLvKELfgAaI,180319,183200,the planets i'm using stencils and i'll
jLvKELfgAaI,183200,185840,make separate video of them to
jLvKELfgAaI,185840,188720,show you why i'm i love to use
jLvKELfgAaI,188720,191200,this kind of things more than
jLvKELfgAaI,191200,193440,stencils actually more than lead of the
jLvKELfgAaI,193440,194720,pots
jLvKELfgAaI,194720,198480,so yeah i'll put like
jLvKELfgAaI,198480,201599,two stencils on the paper
jLvKELfgAaI,201599,202560,and
jLvKELfgAaI,202560,205280,we're just gonna
jLvKELfgAaI,205360,207840,mark them
jLvKELfgAaI,207840,210159,so so we know where it's gonna be our
jLvKELfgAaI,210159,211440,planets
jLvKELfgAaI,211440,214000,and if you didn't saw a tutorial that i
jLvKELfgAaI,214000,216799,made for perfect planet you can check it
jLvKELfgAaI,216799,219360,here i'll put somewhere in the cards
jLvKELfgAaI,219360,220480,so you can
jLvKELfgAaI,220480,223040,check this video maybe i'll remake that
jLvKELfgAaI,223040,224560,video it's
jLvKELfgAaI,224560,226720,it's pretty old video i think it has
jLvKELfgAaI,226720,228239,like
jLvKELfgAaI,228239,229760,three or four years that i made that
jLvKELfgAaI,229760,230720,video
jLvKELfgAaI,230720,231440,so
jLvKELfgAaI,231440,235439,i need to make a new one but till then
jLvKELfgAaI,236159,238159,you can check it yeah
jLvKELfgAaI,238159,239120,so
jLvKELfgAaI,239120,241120,i'll do blue
jLvKELfgAaI,241120,244560,and turkey's planets
jLvKELfgAaI,244560,245680,right now
jLvKELfgAaI,245680,246799,because
jLvKELfgAaI,246799,248879,to make some contrast
jLvKELfgAaI,248879,252480,and as i said on the
jLvKELfgAaI,252799,255680,so two planets colliding here this will
jLvKELfgAaI,255680,258479,be sorts of light and so we're gonna
jLvKELfgAaI,258479,260239,make it
jLvKELfgAaI,260239,262079,this side of planet
jLvKELfgAaI,262079,264639,inner side of planet will be lighter and
jLvKELfgAaI,264639,268560,the outside of planets will be darker so
jLvKELfgAaI,268560,272000,i'm using dark blue
jLvKELfgAaI,276720,280440,then we're gonna use lighter blue
jLvKELfgAaI,280440,283620,[Applause]
jLvKELfgAaI,284080,287439,and even lighter
jLvKELfgAaI,290479,293600,and i add a little bit of your keys just
jLvKELfgAaI,293600,295840,to make
jLvKELfgAaI,295840,298720,interesting shades
jLvKELfgAaI,302000,304639,so we're done
jLvKELfgAaI,306400,309360,that was fast right
jLvKELfgAaI,309600,313440,i'm gonna use magazine papers
jLvKELfgAaI,313759,315840,then we're gonna fold it so we can make
jLvKELfgAaI,315840,319440,some interesting and nice
jLvKELfgAaI,319440,321360,texture
jLvKELfgAaI,321360,324080,with white i'm gonna cover the whole
jLvKELfgAaI,324080,325680,planet
jLvKELfgAaI,325680,327360,and then with black
jLvKELfgAaI,327360,330080,i'll just put on the edge here
jLvKELfgAaI,330080,332320,and we can add a little bit of shades
jLvKELfgAaI,332320,334720,just doing
jLvKELfgAaI,334720,337039,just doing this
jLvKELfgAaI,337039,339199,if you are not happy with this this this
jLvKELfgAaI,339199,341120,don't need to be perfect you can just
jLvKELfgAaI,341120,343600,add a little bit white
jLvKELfgAaI,343600,348280,and then make your mouth
jLvKELfgAaI,353280,355840,simple as that now i like to add a
jLvKELfgAaI,355840,358639,little bit more white on the edge here
jLvKELfgAaI,358639,362720,and a little bit more of black
jLvKELfgAaI,362720,366199,on the other side
jLvKELfgAaI,368880,371440,now we're going to do the same thing
jLvKELfgAaI,371440,372479,with
jLvKELfgAaI,372479,376039,another flat
jLvKELfgAaI,388319,391280,as i said this is not problems at all
jLvKELfgAaI,391280,394880,because when you add your
jLvKELfgAaI,394880,396319,texture
jLvKELfgAaI,396319,397120,it
jLvKELfgAaI,397120,400560,won't matter at all
jLvKELfgAaI,402319,404319,so i want to make like a little bit
jLvKELfgAaI,404319,405520,different
jLvKELfgAaI,405520,409840,texture on the on both planets
jLvKELfgAaI,414880,417599,i just need to remove this
jLvKELfgAaI,417599,419759,magazine paper from here even if you
jLvKELfgAaI,419759,423840,scratch it it's it's not big deal
jLvKELfgAaI,432800,433680,now
jLvKELfgAaI,433680,435759,there's two options
jLvKELfgAaI,435759,438639,you can let it dry for about five
jLvKELfgAaI,438639,440720,minutes because
jLvKELfgAaI,440720,442080,when you're making
jLvKELfgAaI,442080,443360,planets with
jLvKELfgAaI,443360,446000,lid of the pots or with
jLvKELfgAaI,446000,447840,any kind of leads
jLvKELfgAaI,447840,450160,you just don't need to wait the painting
jLvKELfgAaI,450160,451039,to get
jLvKELfgAaI,451039,454000,dry so you can just put leads because it
jLvKELfgAaI,454000,456960,won't stick on on the paper but when you
jLvKELfgAaI,456960,459919,do with stencils like this one
jLvKELfgAaI,459919,462319,they are
jLvKELfgAaI,462319,464720,they are more precise you get more
jLvKELfgAaI,464720,466400,precision with
jLvKELfgAaI,466400,469680,this your edges will be more sharper
jLvKELfgAaI,469680,472000,but you need to wait at least few
jLvKELfgAaI,472000,472960,minutes
jLvKELfgAaI,472960,475840,to get dry or in some cases i'm not even
jLvKELfgAaI,475840,479840,make that long i just put my leads and
jLvKELfgAaI,479840,482560,make even when they are sticky
jLvKELfgAaI,482560,484560,there's they're sticking on the planets
jLvKELfgAaI,484560,486560,i'm just letting them
jLvKELfgAaI,486560,489120,get stick and when you remove them
jLvKELfgAaI,489120,492080,there's a little bit um
jLvKELfgAaI,492080,493440,distortion
jLvKELfgAaI,493440,496080,in a in a pattern but
jLvKELfgAaI,496080,498960,this is not a big deal yeah
jLvKELfgAaI,498960,500960,i mean i really love because every
jLvKELfgAaI,500960,504800,planet is different and you cannot make
jLvKELfgAaI,504800,507919,same planet to time
jLvKELfgAaI,507919,509280,so
jLvKELfgAaI,509280,512800,second option is to use
jLvKELfgAaI,512880,514800,transparent spray can i'm using
jLvKELfgAaI,514800,517039,transparent spray can for
jLvKELfgAaI,517039,520039,fire
jLvKELfgAaI,521090,524239,[Music]
jLvKELfgAaI,530160,532640,now you should not
jLvKELfgAaI,532640,534480,go directly
jLvKELfgAaI,534480,537440,on the painting with fire
jLvKELfgAaI,537440,539760,most of time when you do you should do
jLvKELfgAaI,539760,541839,just like
jLvKELfgAaI,541839,544000,like over painting
jLvKELfgAaI,544000,546320,and then if you have air
jLvKELfgAaI,546320,549200,air gun
jLvKELfgAaI,549200,550880,you can just drive a little bit but if
jLvKELfgAaI,550880,552959,you don't have it it's not easy
jLvKELfgAaI,552959,555600,i work for like
jLvKELfgAaI,555600,557680,eight years as a spray paint artist
jLvKELfgAaI,557680,559680,without
jLvKELfgAaI,559680,561120,air gun
jLvKELfgAaI,561120,563600,and it works totally fine
jLvKELfgAaI,563600,567839,so we're gonna cover our planets
jLvKELfgAaI,567920,570800,with stencils
jLvKELfgAaI,571440,575880,now you want to use some weight
jLvKELfgAaI,580000,585000,just to cover these gaps all around
jLvKELfgAaI,591040,593040,yeah i think that's this will be enough
jLvKELfgAaI,593040,594880,so this is one be some perfect planning
jLvKELfgAaI,594880,596160,this is just like
jLvKELfgAaI,596160,598240,basic tutorial to show you
jLvKELfgAaI,598240,600640,for all of you who are beginners
jLvKELfgAaI,600640,602079,and to all of you who are maybe not
jLvKELfgAaI,602079,606320,beginners to see the way i'm doing my my
jLvKELfgAaI,606320,608320,planets
jLvKELfgAaI,608320,611200,now i'm gonna cover it
jLvKELfgAaI,611200,614600,all in black
jLvKELfgAaI,619120,621279,it smells really bad i'm not
jLvKELfgAaI,621279,623279,i'm not used to
jLvKELfgAaI,623279,627800,spray paint without masks but
jLvKELfgAaI,634079,636640,now this is our source of light and this
jLvKELfgAaI,636640,638320,will be
jLvKELfgAaI,638320,639920,i'll use
jLvKELfgAaI,639920,641040,red
jLvKELfgAaI,641040,644320,red orange and yellow colors to get this
jLvKELfgAaI,644320,647320,effect
jLvKELfgAaI,648800,651360,so i'm gonna cover it first
jLvKELfgAaI,651360,654000,with white
jLvKELfgAaI,657519,661680,then we're gonna use red
jLvKELfgAaI,661680,664640,and outside
jLvKELfgAaI,665200,667040,and then we go lighter and lighter
jLvKELfgAaI,667040,670399,colors to the inside
jLvKELfgAaI,671519,674519,orange
jLvKELfgAaI,676160,678480,dark yellow
jLvKELfgAaI,678480,679600,and then
jLvKELfgAaI,679600,682880,light yellow here
jLvKELfgAaI,684720,686160,then we're gonna
jLvKELfgAaI,686160,688800,apply
jLvKELfgAaI,688800,692480,white as a highlight
jLvKELfgAaI,695760,697680,and we're gonna add
jLvKELfgAaI,697680,699120,stars
jLvKELfgAaI,699120,700959,by spring
jLvKELfgAaI,700959,702560,finger
jLvKELfgAaI,702560,704079,and make this
jLvKELfgAaI,704079,707199,awesome effect
jLvKELfgAaI,712079,715079,now
jLvKELfgAaI,718399,720240,before i remove the stencils i'm gonna
jLvKELfgAaI,720240,721920,use a piece of paper a piece of
jLvKELfgAaI,721920,723920,cardboard or any
jLvKELfgAaI,723920,726399,sorry battery or my cup camera just went
jLvKELfgAaI,726399,727360,off
jLvKELfgAaI,727360,729680,and i need to put it on the charger so
jLvKELfgAaI,729680,731040,yeah let's continue
jLvKELfgAaI,731040,732639,i'm gonna use
jLvKELfgAaI,732639,735760,this piece of cardboard paper or you can
jLvKELfgAaI,735760,737600,use it any kind of
jLvKELfgAaI,737600,740399,paper or any kind of
jLvKELfgAaI,740399,742720,rough surface to make your
jLvKELfgAaI,742720,743600,raise
jLvKELfgAaI,743600,746560,so first of all i'm gonna do
jLvKELfgAaI,746560,748240,some rays that will be
jLvKELfgAaI,748240,750160,behind the planets
jLvKELfgAaI,750160,752890,and it's gonna look
jLvKELfgAaI,752890,754480,[Applause]
jLvKELfgAaI,754480,758120,something like this
jLvKELfgAaI,759250,762360,[Music]
jLvKELfgAaI,769200,771040,so as you can see they are sticky a
jLvKELfgAaI,771040,775279,little bit but this is not a big deal
jLvKELfgAaI,778000,780639,the first one
jLvKELfgAaI,782880,785279,and the second one
jLvKELfgAaI,785279,787120,if they're not really nice
jLvKELfgAaI,787120,789279,when we put transparent spray can it
jLvKELfgAaI,789279,793680,will make just like one one piece
jLvKELfgAaI,793680,797600,so the next thing we're gonna do
jLvKELfgAaI,797760,800720,i'm gonna add a little bit
jLvKELfgAaI,800720,801519,of
jLvKELfgAaI,801519,804320,yellow just on top of this
jLvKELfgAaI,804320,807279,this way just uh
jLvKELfgAaI,807279,808880,a little bit
jLvKELfgAaI,808880,812480,so it's not noticeable but yeah
jLvKELfgAaI,812480,814959,and another thing we're gonna do the
jLvKELfgAaI,814959,816800,same thing just
jLvKELfgAaI,816800,819519,on top of the planet
jLvKELfgAaI,819519,822320,and we're trying to make in the same
jLvKELfgAaI,822320,826800,spot in one single spot to make
jLvKELfgAaI,826800,828959,the
jLvKELfgAaI,831120,834160,and also you don't want to do
jLvKELfgAaI,834160,838880,like this you want to spray paint
jLvKELfgAaI,838880,842399,on 90 degree even maybe 80 but but you
jLvKELfgAaI,842399,844560,want to do this you don't want to do
jLvKELfgAaI,844560,847560,this
jLvKELfgAaI,858600,861690,[Music]
jLvKELfgAaI,863519,867240,nobody can embrace
jLvKELfgAaI,870000,874000,i'm gonna make some smaller rays
jLvKELfgAaI,878800,881600,but always try to hit it in one spot
jLvKELfgAaI,881600,883600,this is the best result for me if you
jLvKELfgAaI,883600,884800,ask me
jLvKELfgAaI,884800,888480,that's how i how i like it
