aKf9DPja1KM,0,1680,hey how's it going and welcome back to
aKf9DPja1KM,1680,3040,my channel today we're going to talk
aKf9DPja1KM,3040,5600,about exploitation and for more context
aKf9DPja1KM,5600,7600,we're basically going to talk about how
aKf9DPja1KM,7600,9920,celebrities and major brands just keep
aKf9DPja1KM,9920,12880,exploiting artists over and over again
aKf9DPja1KM,12880,15599,so billy eilish who everybody and their
aKf9DPja1KM,15599,18480,mother completely loves and adores got
aKf9DPja1KM,18480,20480,up one morning and woke up probably on
aKf9DPja1KM,20480,22640,the wrong side of the bed and decided to
aKf9DPja1KM,22640,26000,partner up with adobe to empower artists
aKf9DPja1KM,26000,27680,and supposedly give back to the
aKf9DPja1KM,27680,30320,community of loyal fans who have shown
aKf9DPja1KM,30320,32480,how much they love her with countless
aKf9DPja1KM,32480,35440,fan art and absolutely amazing drawings
aKf9DPja1KM,35440,37760,half of which he probably will never end
aKf9DPja1KM,37760,40160,up seeing by making a contest where the
aKf9DPja1KM,40160,42960,winner gets a chance to have your unique
aKf9DPja1KM,42960,45280,arch featured on a piece of official
aKf9DPja1KM,45280,47440,merch on billy's tour and these are
aKf9DPja1KM,47440,49600,literally her own words from her
aKf9DPja1KM,49600,51440,official twitter account see it's
aKf9DPja1KM,51440,53520,verified so that means that's the real
aKf9DPja1KM,53520,54559,billy
aKf9DPja1KM,54559,57280,and not the kid
aKf9DPja1KM,57280,60239,because that's a dead outlaw but i guess
aKf9DPja1KM,60239,62399,billy eilish might just be on her own
aKf9DPja1KM,62399,64640,way to becoming an outlaw herself
aKf9DPja1KM,64640,66720,because who else finds comfort in
aKf9DPja1KM,66720,70640,exploiting unsuspecting people
aKf9DPja1KM,70799,73200,hi guys so
aKf9DPja1KM,73200,76159,as you know i am going on tour this year
aKf9DPja1KM,76159,79040,and designing merch right now and i know
aKf9DPja1KM,79040,81360,how creative all of you guys are so i
aKf9DPja1KM,81360,83280,wanted to see if you guys would want to
aKf9DPja1KM,83280,84960,be involved
aKf9DPja1KM,84960,87520,i am going to pick out my favorite piece
aKf9DPja1KM,87520,89600,of fan art to be on one piece of
aKf9DPja1KM,89600,92640,official merch on my tour i can't wait
aKf9DPja1KM,92640,94400,to see what you guys all come up with
aKf9DPja1KM,94400,96479,and i know that it's going to be amazing
aKf9DPja1KM,96479,99920,so please go to billyx adobe.com to get
aKf9DPja1KM,99920,101680,more info
aKf9DPja1KM,101680,103840,and that's all and i love you i can't
aKf9DPja1KM,103840,104600,wait
aKf9DPja1KM,104600,107850,[Music]
aKf9DPja1KM,112000,114159,wow okay so obviously there's a lot to
aKf9DPja1KM,114159,116479,unpack here but before we even go too
aKf9DPja1KM,116479,118640,far this competition is actually
aKf9DPja1KM,118640,121280,sponsored by adobe and from the looks of
aKf9DPja1KM,121280,123520,it this looks like a legit partnership
aKf9DPja1KM,123520,126079,between billy eilish and adobe and if
aKf9DPja1KM,126079,127680,you go to their website they still have
aKf9DPja1KM,127680,130080,promotional videos and images for the
aKf9DPja1KM,130080,132400,competition but apparently it ended some
aKf9DPja1KM,132400,135440,weeks ago and billy eilish is
aKf9DPja1KM,135440,138319,choosing the winner now first off i
aKf9DPja1KM,138319,141520,don't know about you but i pay monthly
aKf9DPja1KM,141520,144480,just to use adobe premiere pro on my
aKf9DPja1KM,144480,146319,computer and for artists who use
aKf9DPja1KM,146319,149120,photoshop legitimately for their work
aKf9DPja1KM,149120,151120,you're probably paying for that too and
aKf9DPja1KM,151120,153280,every other program in the creative suit
aKf9DPja1KM,153280,155440,if you want to gain access to all the
aKf9DPja1KM,155440,158239,features in any of the adobe programs in
aKf9DPja1KM,158239,160720,that suite so what i don't understand is
aKf9DPja1KM,160720,163599,if i have to pay to use adobe programs
aKf9DPja1KM,163599,165760,why is adobe making a competition which
aKf9DPja1KM,165760,168400,has no compensation for the same artists
aKf9DPja1KM,168400,170800,that pay monthly to use their programs
aKf9DPja1KM,170800,172959,this is completely ridiculous especially
aKf9DPja1KM,172959,175440,for a big brand like adobe to just
aKf9DPja1KM,175440,177599,outrightly support exploiting artists
aKf9DPja1KM,177599,180720,who spend so much time money and effort
aKf9DPja1KM,180720,183519,to learn how to make good quality art
aKf9DPja1KM,183519,186159,and some lucky artists even go to art
aKf9DPja1KM,186159,188720,school and spend thousands of dollars
aKf9DPja1KM,188720,190560,and then end up graduating and owing the
aKf9DPja1KM,190560,192159,government and now they have to deal
aKf9DPja1KM,192159,194480,with things like this but here we have
aKf9DPja1KM,194480,196959,adobe totally having zero regard for
aKf9DPja1KM,196959,199360,artists and just asking for art and not
aKf9DPja1KM,199360,201519,thinking of paying for it at all it
aKf9DPja1KM,201519,203920,seems most brands decide to create these
aKf9DPja1KM,203920,206879,splendid ideas for art competitions and
aKf9DPja1KM,206879,209200,then use them as bait to make people who
aKf9DPja1KM,209200,211120,actually support the brand or
aKf9DPja1KM,211120,213680,celebrities send free work which later
aKf9DPja1KM,213680,216000,gets used one way or another but then
aKf9DPja1KM,216000,218080,these so-called brands and celebrities
aKf9DPja1KM,218080,221360,pay for them with exposure and sometimes
aKf9DPja1KM,221360,223120,they just say hey thank you for your
aKf9DPja1KM,223120,224959,work we totally love it and we
aKf9DPja1KM,224959,227200,appreciate the time and effort you spent
aKf9DPja1KM,227200,230080,making this but sadly we can't really
aKf9DPja1KM,230080,232799,afford to pay besides art is a gift and
aKf9DPja1KM,232799,235120,it should be used for the benefit of all
aKf9DPja1KM,235120,236560,mankind
aKf9DPja1KM,236560,238879,don't you think so
aKf9DPja1KM,238879,241200,now don't get me wrong there are actual
aKf9DPja1KM,241200,244159,decent art competitions that pay artists
aKf9DPja1KM,244159,246480,for their work or at least find a way of
aKf9DPja1KM,246480,248640,compensating them with either a drawing
aKf9DPja1KM,248640,250959,tablet or any other device that could be
aKf9DPja1KM,250959,253120,used to make art and then the artist can
aKf9DPja1KM,253120,254959,of course just do whatever they want to
aKf9DPja1KM,254959,257680,do with it heck they can even go sell it
aKf9DPja1KM,257680,260320,and keep the change you filthy animal
aKf9DPja1KM,260320,262639,but making artists make free art for you
aKf9DPja1KM,262639,265520,that you intend to use on merch which
aKf9DPja1KM,265520,268160,obviously you're going to make money off
aKf9DPja1KM,268160,270320,from it's just pushing the limit to be
aKf9DPja1KM,270320,272320,honest the least you can do if you
aKf9DPja1KM,272320,274880,really want to support the art community
aKf9DPja1KM,274880,277280,or artists is to choose a number of
aKf9DPja1KM,277280,279600,artists or have your team choose a
aKf9DPja1KM,279600,281680,number of artists since i clearly know
aKf9DPja1KM,281680,283040,you
aKf9DPja1KM,283040,285759,are not obviously going to be the one
aKf9DPja1KM,285759,288240,who will go around looking for all the
aKf9DPja1KM,288240,290479,artists by yourself so at least just
aKf9DPja1KM,290479,292320,have your team choose a number of
aKf9DPja1KM,292320,294800,artists and have them create official
aKf9DPja1KM,294800,297680,work for your brand of your merch or
aKf9DPja1KM,297680,300080,whatever it is you want to do and just
aKf9DPja1KM,300080,302400,pay them upfront and if you're even
aKf9DPja1KM,302400,304400,feeling really good you can have them
aKf9DPja1KM,304400,307280,sign contracts where they earn royalties
aKf9DPja1KM,307280,310400,or a percentage after every sale you
aKf9DPja1KM,310400,312160,make at least that way it becomes
aKf9DPja1KM,312160,315120,beneficial to both you and the artist in
aKf9DPja1KM,315120,317440,the long run but i guess billy eilish
aKf9DPja1KM,317440,320160,just feels differently about the artists
aKf9DPja1KM,320160,321919,that support her now just like any
aKf9DPja1KM,321919,324960,typical controversial topic on twitter a
aKf9DPja1KM,324960,327360,lot of people had different opinions and
aKf9DPja1KM,327360,330120,most of them revolved around boycotting
aKf9DPja1KM,330120,332720,pdilation adobe and basically just
aKf9DPja1KM,332720,334800,calling them out for scamming artists
aKf9DPja1KM,334800,336880,and exploiting their fans who pay
aKf9DPja1KM,336880,339520,monthly to use adobe products i found a
aKf9DPja1KM,339520,342000,video which literally almost sums up my
aKf9DPja1KM,342000,344560,entire reaction for this situation this
aKf9DPja1KM,344560,346960,is spec work hi i'm a professional
aKf9DPja1KM,346960,349280,artist i make my entire salary every
aKf9DPja1KM,349280,352240,year from making art for other people so
aKf9DPja1KM,352240,354240,please trust me when i say that art
aKf9DPja1KM,354240,356800,contests are exploitative and dangerous
aKf9DPja1KM,356800,358960,and bad for any working artist let me
aKf9DPja1KM,358960,361680,explain by the time a company or a
aKf9DPja1KM,361680,364080,client comes to me and they're like hey
aKf9DPja1KM,364080,366160,we have this project we want you to work
aKf9DPja1KM,366160,368080,on it are you available they have
aKf9DPja1KM,368080,370720,already spent an ass ton of money how is
aKf9DPja1KM,370720,373440,this possible well a company or a client
aKf9DPja1KM,373440,376000,has to pay for the recruitment process
aKf9DPja1KM,376000,378880,they pay people or they themselves go
aKf9DPja1KM,378880,380639,and scout to find artists to work on
aKf9DPja1KM,380639,382400,their project they ask them if they're
aKf9DPja1KM,382400,384080,interested if they're available and if
aKf9DPja1KM,384080,386720,their rates match up so one the
aKf9DPja1KM,386720,388720,recruitment process costs a lot of money
aKf9DPja1KM,388720,392560,two artists create first passes now this
aKf9DPja1KM,392560,394720,totally makes sense you see aside from
aKf9DPja1KM,394720,397039,just having base rates for commissions
aKf9DPja1KM,397039,399600,artists also get to set hourly rates
aKf9DPja1KM,399600,401360,especially when working on bigger
aKf9DPja1KM,401360,403680,projects so the more hours you spend in
aKf9DPja1KM,403680,405840,a day working on an image the more money
aKf9DPja1KM,405840,407520,you make basically
aKf9DPja1KM,407520,408400,well
aKf9DPja1KM,408400,410800,kinda so whenever your art director has
aKf9DPja1KM,410800,413440,you making early drafts and sketches and
aKf9DPja1KM,413440,416160,then has you making reverts and changes
aKf9DPja1KM,416160,418400,and doing corrections and all that it
aKf9DPja1KM,418400,420000,basically means they're going to have to
aKf9DPja1KM,420000,422800,pay you for all the extra hours or days
aKf9DPja1KM,422800,424560,that you're going to spend making those
aKf9DPja1KM,424560,426639,corrections so when a client comes to me
aKf9DPja1KM,426639,428800,and they want me to create a logo or an
aKf9DPja1KM,428800,431919,illustration or a merch design i will go
aKf9DPja1KM,431919,434400,through a first pass process where i
aKf9DPja1KM,434400,437759,create up to hundreds of options and
aKf9DPja1KM,437759,440240,iterations exploring style color
aKf9DPja1KM,440240,443280,composition approach all of this stuff
aKf9DPja1KM,443280,445520,to give the company as many options as i
aKf9DPja1KM,445520,449039,can for their project and even bad
aKf9DPja1KM,449039,451440,iterations are just as important as the
aKf9DPja1KM,451440,453280,good iterations in the first pass
aKf9DPja1KM,453280,454720,because it shows the company what
aKf9DPja1KM,454720,456479,doesn't work and what they don't want
aKf9DPja1KM,456479,459759,and this process costs a lot of money
aKf9DPja1KM,459759,462479,labor costs money this is also true
aKf9DPja1KM,462479,465120,because most studios always pay artists
aKf9DPja1KM,465120,467520,for tests and these are just basically
aKf9DPja1KM,467520,469840,first passes to see if the artist can
aKf9DPja1KM,469840,472240,fit the style of the project or just to
aKf9DPja1KM,472240,474479,see what the artist's take on their ip
aKf9DPja1KM,474479,476720,is and to see if the artist can bring a
aKf9DPja1KM,476720,480240,different look or unique concept to
aKf9DPja1KM,480240,483120,the ip so during an art contest a
aKf9DPja1KM,483120,485680,company or a musician or whatever is
aKf9DPja1KM,485680,488080,getting all of these free options and
aKf9DPja1KM,488080,490240,they're also having artists come to them
aKf9DPja1KM,490240,491039,which
aKf9DPja1KM,491039,492560,obviously means that they don't have to
aKf9DPja1KM,492560,495199,pay for recruitment but megan working
aKf9DPja1KM,495199,496960,with billy eilish and adobe is going to
aKf9DPja1KM,496960,498879,give you so much exposure
aKf9DPja1KM,498879,502240,no it won't let me explain name one
aKf9DPja1KM,502240,503919,artist off of the top of your head that
aKf9DPja1KM,503919,505520,you know specifically that you
aKf9DPja1KM,505520,507599,discovered specifically from winning an
aKf9DPja1KM,507599,510319,art contest
aKf9DPja1KM,514719,516719,i actually don't know any artists that
aKf9DPja1KM,516719,518959,won a competition from the top of my
aKf9DPja1KM,518959,521839,head exactly a lot of the times during
aKf9DPja1KM,521839,523839,these art contests in the rules and
aKf9DPja1KM,523839,525680,terms and conditions and all that they
aKf9DPja1KM,525680,527839,say that anything you submit even if you
aKf9DPja1KM,527839,529200,don't win
aKf9DPja1KM,529200,531360,the company and client will own they
aKf9DPja1KM,531360,534000,have every right at that point to take
aKf9DPja1KM,534000,536080,it and print it on merchandise without
aKf9DPja1KM,536080,538000,paying you even if you don't win they
aKf9DPja1KM,538000,539920,have every right if they own the artwork
aKf9DPja1KM,539920,541120,that you're submitting to them in the
aKf9DPja1KM,541120,543040,terms of service and all that [ __ ]
aKf9DPja1KM,543040,545600,to print it and make money off of you
aKf9DPja1KM,545600,547120,because they own it
aKf9DPja1KM,547120,549120,this is a really good video by megan
aKf9DPja1KM,549120,551360,just breaking down the entire situation
aKf9DPja1KM,551360,554959,and just house back work runs in general
aKf9DPja1KM,554959,556480,and for those of you who aren't
aKf9DPja1KM,556480,559040,following megan or don't
aKf9DPja1KM,559040,561600,know about her work or haven't seen her
aKf9DPja1KM,561600,564000,work before she's actually an amazing
aKf9DPja1KM,564000,565920,artist and i've been following her work
aKf9DPja1KM,565920,568480,on instagram since i've stumbled on it

aKf9DPja1KM,577600,579920,she's just spitting straight fire too
aKf9DPja1KM,579920,582320,this comment is very snarky and cute

aKf9DPja1KM,625839,627839,money off of it this is super [ __ ] up
aKf9DPja1KM,627839,629440,um
aKf9DPja1KM,629440,631120,billy eilish i like you and everything
aKf9DPja1KM,631120,632720,adobe
aKf9DPja1KM,632720,635120,you're there but this sucks please don't
aKf9DPja1KM,635120,637680,do this anytime competitions like this
aKf9DPja1KM,637680,639680,are created they usually put it
aKf9DPja1KM,639680,641839,somewhere within the terms of service
aKf9DPja1KM,641839,644560,that any and all art that is created for
aKf9DPja1KM,644560,646480,the competition automatically just
aKf9DPja1KM,646480,648480,belongs to the company after the
aKf9DPja1KM,648480,651360,competition and the artists have just
aKf9DPja1KM,651360,653839,forfeited all the rights to their work
aKf9DPja1KM,653839,656399,so the company can't just if they feel
aKf9DPja1KM,656399,657440,like it
aKf9DPja1KM,657440,660640,use all the images at once or use them
aKf9DPja1KM,660640,663680,later on down the line if they feel like
aKf9DPja1KM,663680,666399,in any of their upcoming competitions or
aKf9DPja1KM,666399,668720,projects or whatever sometimes they even
aKf9DPja1KM,668720,671440,just make prints of it or art books or
aKf9DPja1KM,671440,674560,magazines with people's work that they
aKf9DPja1KM,674560,675440,just
aKf9DPja1KM,675440,678160,claimed out of the blues just seems like
aKf9DPja1KM,678160,680160,everyone who works for these kind of
aKf9DPja1KM,680160,682959,companies are related to eminem in some
aKf9DPja1KM,682959,685200,way because everything they do is just
aKf9DPja1KM,685200,687200,shady and the thing is they don't even
aKf9DPja1KM,687200,689519,care and they just keep doing it all the
aKf9DPja1KM,689519,692160,time and another important side note i
aKf9DPja1KM,692160,693519,almost forgot
aKf9DPja1KM,693519,696560,thank you brain for not letting me down
aKf9DPja1KM,696560,699040,as usual apparently all the other
aKf9DPja1KM,699040,701120,artists that wear or would have been
aKf9DPja1KM,701120,703680,hired to work on this campaign for adobe
aKf9DPja1KM,703680,705600,would definitely have been paid to
aKf9DPja1KM,705600,707680,create marketing
aKf9DPja1KM,707680,710160,material or just promotional images or
aKf9DPja1KM,710160,712240,whatever and before anyone goes hey
aKf9DPja1KM,712240,714000,mohammed how do you know that vital
aKf9DPja1KM,714000,716160,information one artist who was reached
aKf9DPja1KM,716160,718959,out to by adobe posted his response on
aKf9DPja1KM,718959,721519,twitter i was approached by an agency to
aKf9DPja1KM,721519,723920,work on paid promotional assets for the
aKf9DPja1KM,723920,726880,billyx adobe campaign this was my
aKf9DPja1KM,726880,729360,response hopefully this can help prevent
aKf9DPja1KM,729360,731279,these kind of malicious spec work
aKf9DPja1KM,731279,733600,contests from happening in the future oh
aKf9DPja1KM,733600,736240,i guess he wasn't approached directly by
aKf9DPja1KM,736240,738560,adobe but it was probably an agency
aKf9DPja1KM,738560,741040,that's handling the work for adobe which
aKf9DPja1KM,741040,743519,is usually how agencies work and i like
aKf9DPja1KM,743519,745680,how we just called it malicious spec
aKf9DPja1KM,745680,747760,work so we can all just understand it's
aKf9DPja1KM,747760,750560,a ploy to manipulate and use artists
aKf9DPja1KM,750560,753680,unlike an actual campaign that hires and
aKf9DPja1KM,753680,755839,pays artists for their work thanks for
aKf9DPja1KM,755839,757920,reaching back out i did some more
aKf9DPja1KM,757920,759839,thinking about the project after you
aKf9DPja1KM,759839,762399,first approached me and if i'm being
aKf9DPja1KM,762399,764639,honest i don't really want to be part of
aKf9DPja1KM,764639,767200,a campaign that is centered around adobe
aKf9DPja1KM,767200,769519,and spec work i know i will be getting
aKf9DPja1KM,769519,771920,paid and all but it encourages a lot of
aKf9DPja1KM,771920,774399,young designers to create work for free
aKf9DPja1KM,774399,777519,in this contest system that i think can
aKf9DPja1KM,777519,779839,be predatory i hope you can understand
aKf9DPja1KM,779839,781920,and as stated before i would love to
aKf9DPja1KM,781920,783680,work with you all on future projects
aKf9DPja1KM,783680,786399,that better fit my views and schedule
aKf9DPja1KM,786399,789680,thanks jesse
aKf9DPja1KM,790040,791920,[Applause]
aKf9DPja1KM,791920,794240,he actually put that agency in their
aKf9DPja1KM,794240,796160,place imagine the person reading this
aKf9DPja1KM,796160,798959,email seeing this and knowing he is
aKf9DPja1KM,798959,802480,right it is predatory behavior but still
aKf9DPja1KM,802480,804240,went ahead to send other artists a
aKf9DPja1KM,804240,806320,contract to participate in the project
aKf9DPja1KM,806320,808959,and prey on young artists post was well
aKf9DPja1KM,808959,810880,received and appreciated by other
aKf9DPja1KM,810880,812880,artists on twitter and someone even
aKf9DPja1KM,812880,815279,asked him if the agency responded to
aKf9DPja1KM,815279,817920,which he replied nope they didn't which
aKf9DPja1KM,817920,820079,was totally expected of them i mean
aKf9DPja1KM,820079,822480,obviously for people who are already
aKf9DPja1KM,822480,824639,prepared to not pay artists for any of
aKf9DPja1KM,824639,826959,the work they create in a competition
aKf9DPja1KM,826959,829360,you just gave them a genuine reason not
aKf9DPja1KM,829360,831839,to even bother paying you as well
aKf9DPja1KM,831839,834079,i mean obviously they're not even going
aKf9DPja1KM,834079,836000,to hire you in the first place and they
aKf9DPja1KM,836000,837920,just took it with open arms well
aKf9DPja1KM,837920,839760,everyone on twitter is literally just
aKf9DPja1KM,839760,842000,going insane right now and the comments
aKf9DPja1KM,842000,844959,are just wild because just like me most
aKf9DPja1KM,844959,847519,people can't believe adobe will do
aKf9DPja1KM,847519,849519,something like this especially to the
aKf9DPja1KM,849519,851680,same people that are part of the reason
aKf9DPja1KM,851680,853920,why your company is where it is right
aKf9DPja1KM,853920,856000,now i don't understand anyone defending
aKf9DPja1KM,856000,858320,companies that do this she's trying to
aKf9DPja1KM,858320,860880,warn and help the individual some people
aKf9DPja1KM,860880,862800,say it's not about the money but
aKf9DPja1KM,862800,865040,exposure but if the company takes your
aKf9DPja1KM,865040,867199,work and never credits you how are you
aKf9DPja1KM,867199,868880,getting exposure i feel like for
aKf9DPja1KM,868880,871199,competitions like this it's never even
aKf9DPja1KM,871199,873440,about the exposure at all it's more or
aKf9DPja1KM,873440,875680,less about the price tags that come with
aKf9DPja1KM,875680,878240,competitions like this if you win i mean
aKf9DPja1KM,878240,881040,exposure can only take you so far but
aKf9DPja1KM,881040,883199,two thousand dollars can pay your rent i
aKf9DPja1KM,883199,885199,don't see anyone paying their landlord
aKf9DPja1KM,885199,887120,with exposure i learned about that
aKf9DPja1KM,887120,890240,pretty young years ago my friend did art
aKf9DPja1KM,890240,893040,contests on devendra crew free fine arts
aKf9DPja1KM,893040,894880,without commissioning people never
aKf9DPja1KM,894880,897519,picked a winner or paid out a prize wait
aKf9DPja1KM,897519,899680,until people forgot or made a new
aKf9DPja1KM,899680,902880,account rinse and repeat people are
aKf9DPja1KM,902880,904800,scummy i don't want to call out your
aKf9DPja1KM,904800,909600,friend or call them names but um
aKf9DPja1KM,909600,912639,yikes the sheer audacity of musicians
aKf9DPja1KM,912639,915440,making this type of play like
aKf9DPja1KM,915440,918079,my concert tickets are worth hundreds of
aKf9DPja1KM,918079,920480,dollars but your creative craft isn't
aKf9DPja1KM,920480,923040,worth anything like pardon it's like
aKf9DPja1KM,923040,925360,they literally don't rate artists at all
aKf9DPja1KM,925360,927360,and just somehow forget drawing in
aKf9DPja1KM,927360,930560,itself is an art form just like music so
aKf9DPja1KM,930560,932800,if they place value and worth on their
aKf9DPja1KM,932800,935199,concerts they should literally place the
aKf9DPja1KM,935199,938000,same value and worth on the artist they
aKf9DPja1KM,938000,939920,want to hire to make work for their
aKf9DPja1KM,939920,942480,concerts and merch and everything they
aKf9DPja1KM,942480,945040,intend to use as promotional material
aKf9DPja1KM,945040,947519,and not try to guide behind curtains
aKf9DPja1KM,947519,950079,begging for free work ironically i do
aKf9DPja1KM,950079,952320,know one artist from a competition with
aKf9DPja1KM,952320,954639,a music artist but the point still
aKf9DPja1KM,954639,957120,stands the competitions are smoked to
aKf9DPja1KM,957120,959920,give labels free labor and massive
aKf9DPja1KM,959920,962240,publicity i mean it seems like the only
aKf9DPja1KM,962240,964079,people that are actually going to
aKf9DPja1KM,964079,966399,benefit from any of this is the
aKf9DPja1KM,966399,969120,celebrities themselves and
aKf9DPja1KM,969120,970880,whoever is partnering up with the
aKf9DPja1KM,970880,973199,celebrities because yes artists are
aKf9DPja1KM,973199,975279,going to just create a lot of hype for
aKf9DPja1KM,975279,977360,your campaign or whatever it is you're
aKf9DPja1KM,977360,980000,doing and then you're going to obviously
aKf9DPja1KM,980000,982079,give them a hashtag to promote so it's
aKf9DPja1KM,982079,985199,just free exposure for you and your
aKf9DPja1KM,985199,987279,brand as you can see no one on twitter
aKf9DPja1KM,987279,989440,is having it at all and i myself i'm
aKf9DPja1KM,989440,993120,just looking at billy i just like
aKf9DPja1KM,993120,995279,and i'm just looking disgusted with
aKf9DPja1KM,995279,998959,adobe for even partnering and promoting
aKf9DPja1KM,998959,1001199,something like this i mean i paid to use
aKf9DPja1KM,1001199,1004000,adobe every month to edit these videos
aKf9DPja1KM,1004000,1005920,you're watching and i know other artists
aKf9DPja1KM,1005920,1008079,who made drawings for the competitions
aKf9DPja1KM,1008079,1010800,obviously might be paying adobe too so
aKf9DPja1KM,1010800,1012880,for them to just create a campaign like
aKf9DPja1KM,1012880,1015519,this and promote it and actually go
aKf9DPja1KM,1015519,1018480,through with it it just doesn't say well
aKf9DPja1KM,1018480,1020160,about them at all i guess we'll just
aKf9DPja1KM,1020160,1022880,have to wait till billy irish finishes
aKf9DPja1KM,1022880,1024959,choosing who the winner is and then
aKf9DPja1KM,1024959,1027600,we'll see what they intend to do after
aKf9DPja1KM,1027600,1029600,all these rockers on twitter maybe they
aKf9DPja1KM,1029600,1031678,might even think about their decision
aKf9DPja1KM,1031678,1033839,and end up giving the winners some money
aKf9DPja1KM,1033839,1036720,or something at least anyway that's it
