F6R_WTDdx7I,0,1439,whenever i need to look like the kind of
F6R_WTDdx7I,1439,3520,guy who understands fashion i cram
F6R_WTDdx7I,3520,5120,myself into a suit that looks like it
F6R_WTDdx7I,5120,7040,was made for some kind of european
F6R_WTDdx7I,7040,9280,heroin addict and for the low price of
F6R_WTDdx7I,9280,11759,30 dollars you too can walk out of an h
F6R_WTDdx7I,11759,13679,m dressed like your slenderman's younger
F6R_WTDdx7I,13679,15679,brother in fact at prices like these it
F6R_WTDdx7I,15679,17359,can be more expensive to clean your
F6R_WTDdx7I,17359,19199,clothes than it is to throw away your
F6R_WTDdx7I,19199,21439,dirty clothes and buy all new ones and i
F6R_WTDdx7I,21439,22880,know that sounds like the kind of plan
F6R_WTDdx7I,22880,24320,that was invented by some sort of
F6R_WTDdx7I,24320,26240,nine-year-old king but it's actually
F6R_WTDdx7I,26240,27920,pretty close to reality because the
F6R_WTDdx7I,27920,30400,average garment in america is worn just
F6R_WTDdx7I,30400,32640,seven times before it's thrown away and
F6R_WTDdx7I,32640,34559,if you're thinking well
F6R_WTDdx7I,34559,36480,it's a good thing i donate my clothes to
F6R_WTDdx7I,36480,37680,other people
F6R_WTDdx7I,37680,40000,that's not actually happening oh you're
F6R_WTDdx7I,40000,42160,donating your clothes but that basically
F6R_WTDdx7I,42160,43680,just means that your clothes take a
F6R_WTDdx7I,43680,45520,little trip to the salvation army where
F6R_WTDdx7I,45520,47120,they say thank you for your service
F6R_WTDdx7I,47120,49039,before 90
F6R_WTDdx7I,49039,51360,of all clothes donated to a thrift store
F6R_WTDdx7I,51360,53120,get rejected and sent straight to a
F6R_WTDdx7I,53120,55440,landfill or a textile waste mill with
F6R_WTDdx7I,55440,58239,stores like h m uniqlo zara guess and
F6R_WTDdx7I,58239,60000,gap selling low quality clothes at
F6R_WTDdx7I,60000,62160,bargain basement prices americans buy an
F6R_WTDdx7I,62160,65119,average of 68 items of clothing every
F6R_WTDdx7I,65119,67600,year which seems like a lot of clothes
F6R_WTDdx7I,67600,69439,but it's not even all the clothes
F6R_WTDdx7I,69439,71439,because 10 of clothing produced gets
F6R_WTDdx7I,71439,73840,worn zero times because it never gets
F6R_WTDdx7I,73840,75520,bought and it just goes straight into
F6R_WTDdx7I,75520,77119,the garbage
F6R_WTDdx7I,77119,79360,not this specific garbage obviously this
F6R_WTDdx7I,79360,80799,is just a visual represent you know what
F6R_WTDdx7I,80799,83040,you get it but the point is fast fashion
F6R_WTDdx7I,83040,85280,is so big and wasteful that it produces
F6R_WTDdx7I,85280,88479,more co2 than france germany and the uk
F6R_WTDdx7I,88479,90799,combined fast fashion is devastating to
F6R_WTDdx7I,90799,92799,the climate and it is a husky-sized
F6R_WTDdx7I,92799,95040,human rights violation but it is so
F6R_WTDdx7I,95040,97280,profitable that it's projected to triple
F6R_WTDdx7I,97280,99600,by 2050 unless we change something we
F6R_WTDdx7I,99600,101520,are currently knocking on the door of a
F6R_WTDdx7I,101520,103119,climate catastrophe and we need to be
F6R_WTDdx7I,103119,105600,reducing our co2 emissions instead of
F6R_WTDdx7I,105600,107600,greatly increasing them and how we deal
F6R_WTDdx7I,107600,109600,with fast fashion may determine if we're
F6R_WTDdx7I,109600,111439,able to avoid some of the worst parts of
F6R_WTDdx7I,111439,113920,a climate disaster but unlike most of
F6R_WTDdx7I,113920,115920,the systemic causes of climate change
F6R_WTDdx7I,115920,117439,there's actually something you can do
F6R_WTDdx7I,117439,120000,about fast fashion maybe hi i'm raleigh
F6R_WTDdx7I,120000,122000,williams a sort of discount burt
F6R_WTDdx7I,122000,123680,reynolds type and a climate science and
F6R_WTDdx7I,123680,125920,policy grad student and this is a video
F6R_WTDdx7I,125920,127520,about fast fashion welcome to
F6R_WTDdx7I,127520,130160,climatetown
F6R_WTDdx7I,131840,133840,now fashion wasn't always about buying
F6R_WTDdx7I,133840,135520,five dollar dresses or trying to look
F6R_WTDdx7I,135520,138160,like a sexy haysack mission very much
F6R_WTDdx7I,138160,140640,accomplished by the way before the 1800s
F6R_WTDdx7I,140640,142400,people either made their own clothing
F6R_WTDdx7I,142400,144879,bought it secondhand from slop shops or
F6R_WTDdx7I,144879,146239,went to their local tailors or
F6R_WTDdx7I,146239,148560,seamstresses in any case they wore the
F6R_WTDdx7I,148560,150560,garments until they fell apart or they
F6R_WTDdx7I,150560,153360,died at the ripe old age of 29 the way
F6R_WTDdx7I,153360,156080,god intended so while ultra rich people
F6R_WTDdx7I,156080,158319,like kings queens or the wealthiest
F6R_WTDdx7I,158319,160400,rooks could afford fancy fashion and
F6R_WTDdx7I,160400,162560,trends durable clothing was the name of
F6R_WTDdx7I,162560,164480,the game for most people basically i'd
F6R_WTDdx7I,164480,165920,be wearing this suit until i looked like
F6R_WTDdx7I,165920,167519,some kind of accountant that got sucked
F6R_WTDdx7I,167519,171840,into the jumanji game for 15 years
F6R_WTDdx7I,172239,174239,but then the industrial revolution
F6R_WTDdx7I,174239,176800,happened and people who talked like this
F6R_WTDdx7I,176800,179280,had more less people who done talk like
F6R_WTDdx7I,179280,181280,this were spending more time working in
F6R_WTDdx7I,181280,182800,factories and had less time to make
F6R_WTDdx7I,182800,184800,their own clothes so a spike in demand
F6R_WTDdx7I,184800,186400,for ready-made clothes was met with an
F6R_WTDdx7I,186400,188319,abundant supply of cotton from america
F6R_WTDdx7I,188319,191280,because of slavery
F6R_WTDdx7I,191280,193599,slavery
F6R_WTDdx7I,193599,195599,well demand for clothes plus a cotton
F6R_WTDdx7I,195599,197680,supply plus new textile technology
F6R_WTDdx7I,197680,199040,allowed clothing to be produced at a
F6R_WTDdx7I,199040,201040,much greater scale at a lower price
F6R_WTDdx7I,201040,202800,allowing more people access to more
F6R_WTDdx7I,202800,204720,types of clothing now all of this new
F6R_WTDdx7I,204720,206879,technology and money made factory owners
F6R_WTDdx7I,206879,209519,and slave owners a fat stack of cash
F6R_WTDdx7I,209519,210799,because they paid their workers
F6R_WTDdx7I,210799,213200,practically nothing or actually nothing
F6R_WTDdx7I,213200,215120,and they profited massively from the
F6R_WTDdx7I,215120,217200,economies of scale technically slavery
F6R_WTDdx7I,217200,218879,ended with the ratification of the 13th
F6R_WTDdx7I,218879,221280,amendment in 1865 but poor working
F6R_WTDdx7I,221280,223519,conditions and intentionally low wages
F6R_WTDdx7I,223519,225840,kept factory owners incredibly rich and
F6R_WTDdx7I,225840,228000,these cartoonishly evil men did things
F6R_WTDdx7I,228000,230319,like lock the exits and stairwells so
F6R_WTDdx7I,230319,231760,that their workers wouldn't be tempted
F6R_WTDdx7I,231760,233599,to take breaks from their nightmarish
F6R_WTDdx7I,233599,235519,working conditions or steal a pair of
F6R_WTDdx7I,235519,239280,socks and then on march 25th 1911 a fire
F6R_WTDdx7I,239280,241680,broke out in this building and if you're
F6R_WTDdx7I,241680,243200,hoping that maybe this isn't the
F6R_WTDdx7I,243200,246319,triangle shirtwaist factory building
F6R_WTDdx7I,246319,248239,you're out of luck the workers in the
F6R_WTDdx7I,248239,250239,factory were unable to escape the fire
F6R_WTDdx7I,250239,251840,because the factory owners did that
F6R_WTDdx7I,251840,254120,thing where they lock everyone in and
F6R_WTDdx7I,254120,257280,146 people mostly women between the ages
F6R_WTDdx7I,257280,259280,of 14 and 23 were killed when they
F6R_WTDdx7I,259280,261120,either burned alive or jumped to the
F6R_WTDdx7I,261120,263919,pavement eight floors below it was
F6R_WTDdx7I,263919,266960,tragic and it shocked the nation and of
F6R_WTDdx7I,266960,269520,[ __ ] course the factory owners ended
F6R_WTDdx7I,269520,271840,up making money on the tragedy because
F6R_WTDdx7I,271840,273840,of an insurance claim and some shiesty
F6R_WTDdx7I,273840,276080,courtroom moves two years later the
F6R_WTDdx7I,276080,278240,owner of the factory actually got caught
F6R_WTDdx7I,278240,280560,locking the doors again and he got the
F6R_WTDdx7I,280560,283680,electric chair oh no he got
F6R_WTDdx7I,283680,286800,fined 20 which was the minimum allowable
F6R_WTDdx7I,286800,288560,fine for that kind of thing
F6R_WTDdx7I,288560,290320,anyway over the next 40 years and with
F6R_WTDdx7I,290320,291919,the help of francis perkins the
F6R_WTDdx7I,291919,293440,secretary of labor under president
F6R_WTDdx7I,293440,295360,roosevelt enough labor reforms were
F6R_WTDdx7I,295360,296960,implemented that working in the fashion
F6R_WTDdx7I,296960,300400,industry was maybe kind of okay i mean
F6R_WTDdx7I,300400,302160,you weren't making chess piece money but
F6R_WTDdx7I,302160,304880,at least you had a weekend insurance
F6R_WTDdx7I,304880,307680,time off and best of all the goddamn
F6R_WTDdx7I,307680,309680,doors weren't locked at the risk of
F6R_WTDdx7I,309680,312080,leaving out a ton of context everything
F6R_WTDdx7I,312080,314320,i've described so far is traditional
F6R_WTDdx7I,314320,316560,slow fashion clothing is designed
F6R_WTDdx7I,316560,318720,manufactured shipped and sold
F6R_WTDdx7I,318720,322400,domestically and as recently as
F6R_WTDdx7I,322960,324560,i'm not gonna die for this video as
F6R_WTDdx7I,324560,326800,recently as 1990 more than half the
F6R_WTDdx7I,326800,329199,clothes bought in america were also made
F6R_WTDdx7I,329199,332080,in america but between 1990 and now so
F6R_WTDdx7I,332080,333759,much manufacturing went overseas that
F6R_WTDdx7I,333759,335919,america now makes less than two percent
F6R_WTDdx7I,335919,338160,of its clothes and now almost every item
F6R_WTDdx7I,338160,340160,of clothing worn in america has to first
F6R_WTDdx7I,340160,342880,make a co2 intensive international trip
F6R_WTDdx7I,342880,344479,before anyone wants to dress up to go to
F6R_WTDdx7I,344479,346720,brunch or church
F6R_WTDdx7I,346720,347520,or
F6R_WTDdx7I,347520,349680,baseball game what do people do anymore
F6R_WTDdx7I,349680,351280,and we're not talking about one little
F6R_WTDdx7I,351280,353199,international trip to paris and back
F6R_WTDdx7I,353199,354560,since the only thing manufacturers
F6R_WTDdx7I,354560,355840,really care about is minimizing
F6R_WTDdx7I,355840,357600,production costs the life of a shirt
F6R_WTDdx7I,357600,359360,might begin with cotton grown in india
F6R_WTDdx7I,359360,361520,then gets sent to mexico to be processed
F6R_WTDdx7I,361520,363520,then gets sent to bangladesh to be sewn
F6R_WTDdx7I,363520,365280,together then get sent to colombia to
F6R_WTDdx7I,365280,367039,have the tags sewn on then get sent to
F6R_WTDdx7I,367039,368960,miami to be distributed to a store in
F6R_WTDdx7I,368960,370800,georgia but what's a little thousand
F6R_WTDdx7I,370800,372400,tons of heat trapping gas in the
F6R_WTDdx7I,372400,373840,atmosphere if it means you could buy
F6R_WTDdx7I,373840,376560,this very real shirt that says fridays
F6R_WTDdx7I,376560,379039,would be like squad goals and just to be
F6R_WTDdx7I,379039,380880,clear clothing manufacturers didn't move
F6R_WTDdx7I,380880,382319,their factories to other countries so
F6R_WTDdx7I,382319,384160,that they could make better clothes they
F6R_WTDdx7I,384160,385680,did it so they could go back to treating
F6R_WTDdx7I,385680,388240,their workers like they did in 1911. now
F6R_WTDdx7I,388240,389919,since companies didn't have to pay for
F6R_WTDdx7I,389919,392080,vacations or health insurance or fire
F6R_WTDdx7I,392080,394080,extinguishers their profits shot through
F6R_WTDdx7I,394080,396240,the roof like a drunken cowboy hey are
F6R_WTDdx7I,396240,397759,people gonna actually get that cowboy
F6R_WTDdx7I,397759,399600,what's up the cowboy line you just said
F6R_WTDdx7I,399600,401759,the cow shot through the roof line yeah
F6R_WTDdx7I,401759,403520,it's a it's like the number one cowboy
F6R_WTDdx7I,403520,405199,thing where they get drunk at a bar they
F6R_WTDdx7I,405199,406639,got too much whiskey and they're like
F6R_WTDdx7I,406639,409120,whoop whiskey you know they shoot up
F6R_WTDdx7I,409120,411360,into the room i think that's prospector
F6R_WTDdx7I,411360,413120,you get it right you getting this i
F6R_WTDdx7I,413120,415280,don't think i get it you're me what do
F6R_WTDdx7I,415280,416880,you mean you don't get it i just don't
F6R_WTDdx7I,416880,417840,think it's
F6R_WTDdx7I,417840,420000,clear it's you know what
F6R_WTDdx7I,420000,421840,what okay we'll put a part where both of
F6R_WTDdx7I,421840,423680,us belabor this and then i'll do a
F6R_WTDdx7I,423680,426720,patreon page plug at the end of it okay
F6R_WTDdx7I,426720,427759,right
F6R_WTDdx7I,427759,429680,here and people can just make fun of you
F6R_WTDdx7I,429680,432240,in the comments if they wanna
F6R_WTDdx7I,432240,433919,roast me in the comments and sign up for
F6R_WTDdx7I,433919,435440,my patreon they're gonna do that and
F6R_WTDdx7I,435440,437039,their profits shot through the roof like
F6R_WTDdx7I,437039,439520,end of sentence and sure these major
F6R_WTDdx7I,439520,441280,american manufacturing companies who
F6R_WTDdx7I,441280,443360,move their factories to china india
F6R_WTDdx7I,443360,445599,bangladesh etc could have used that
F6R_WTDdx7I,445599,448000,money to pay their workers a living wage
F6R_WTDdx7I,448000,451120,and they did
F6R_WTDdx7I,451120,453520,not [ __ ] they did not they used that
F6R_WTDdx7I,453520,455919,money to expand executive salaries by
F6R_WTDdx7I,455919,457039,500
F6R_WTDdx7I,457039,458880,but wait it gets worse because as the
F6R_WTDdx7I,458880,460639,cost of manufacturing clothes shot
F6R_WTDdx7I,460639,462400,through the floor like a drunken cowboys
F6R_WTDdx7I,462400,464080,upstairs neighbor clothing companies
F6R_WTDdx7I,464080,465759,were able to sell clothes for cheaper
F6R_WTDdx7I,465759,467360,which means people were able to buy more
F6R_WTDdx7I,467360,469039,clothes and not like an extra shirt that
F6R_WTDdx7I,469039,471120,says catch up with jesus or my other
F6R_WTDdx7I,471120,473280,shirt is a truck the average american is
F6R_WTDdx7I,473280,475199,now buying five to six articles of
F6R_WTDdx7I,475199,477919,clothing every month which is five times
F6R_WTDdx7I,477919,480560,more than we did in the 1980s the decade
F6R_WTDdx7I,480560,481970,we did everything right
F6R_WTDdx7I,481970,488479,[Music]
F6R_WTDdx7I,488479,490240,so as consumers bought more and more
F6R_WTDdx7I,490240,492080,clothes it started a cycle that paid
F6R_WTDdx7I,492080,494400,executives to hire more overseas workers
F6R_WTDdx7I,494400,496400,at starvation wages to make more
F6R_WTDdx7I,496400,498479,low-quality clothes to ship them over to
F6R_WTDdx7I,498479,500319,america to put them in stores that told
F6R_WTDdx7I,500319,502000,people that the color of the season is
F6R_WTDdx7I,502000,507160,blue baby and you just gotta buy it
F6R_WTDdx7I,507840,508879,ah
F6R_WTDdx7I,508879,511440,no one has landed a kickflip since 1999.
F6R_WTDdx7I,511440,512959,and if you're familiar with my general
F6R_WTDdx7I,512959,515360,kind of climate change shtick uh you'll
F6R_WTDdx7I,515360,517039,guess that i'm only talking about this
F6R_WTDdx7I,517039,518959,because the spike in manufacturing has
F6R_WTDdx7I,518959,521760,come at an enormous cost to the climate
F6R_WTDdx7I,521760,523279,when you grow cotton or manufactured
F6R_WTDdx7I,523279,526160,plastic to make clothes it generates co2
F6R_WTDdx7I,526160,529120,you also need like 1800 gallons of water
F6R_WTDdx7I,529120,531760,to make a single pair of jeans which
F6R_WTDdx7I,531760,533760,seemed high to me and then i did the
F6R_WTDdx7I,533760,535760,research and it turns out all of the
F6R_WTDdx7I,535760,538720,sources confirmed that including levi's
F6R_WTDdx7I,538720,541440,own website so like
F6R_WTDdx7I,541440,543120,wow when you process the cotton and
F6R_WTDdx7I,543120,545839,plastic it also generates co2 when you
F6R_WTDdx7I,545839,547760,transport it to stores around the world
F6R_WTDdx7I,547760,549680,when you buy it in an online purchase
F6R_WTDdx7I,549680,551600,hell when you throw it away or donate
F6R_WTDdx7I,551600,554080,your clothes all of that is generating
F6R_WTDdx7I,554080,557120,more co2 are you an actor i'm doing a
F6R_WTDdx7I,557120,559920,youtube video oh i'm not an actor i'm a
F6R_WTDdx7I,559920,562160,comedian which is way worse i'm sorry
F6R_WTDdx7I,562160,563040,thank you
F6R_WTDdx7I,563040,565839,love you too james good to meet you
F6R_WTDdx7I,565839,568080,what a nice guy all told the fashion
F6R_WTDdx7I,568080,570240,industry contributes to 10
F6R_WTDdx7I,570240,572399,of our global greenhouse gas emissions
F6R_WTDdx7I,572399,573279,which
F6R_WTDdx7I,573279,575519,is crazy high but it's also a little
F6R_WTDdx7I,575519,577839,abstract and it's not super landing for
F6R_WTDdx7I,577839,579360,me right now and i promise i can do
F6R_WTDdx7I,579360,580959,better how about this take a company
F6R_WTDdx7I,580959,584160,like zara zara did roughly 26 billion
F6R_WTDdx7I,584160,586560,dollars in sales in 2019 and is so
F6R_WTDdx7I,586560,588480,insanely profitable that the dude who
F6R_WTDdx7I,588480,591040,invented zara armancio ortega became one
F6R_WTDdx7I,591040,593279,of the 10 richest people on the planet
F6R_WTDdx7I,593279,594959,for selling shirts that say [ __ ] like
F6R_WTDdx7I,594959,597040,kiss me on monday they make so much
F6R_WTDdx7I,597040,598959,money that every other brand is just
F6R_WTDdx7I,598959,601279,gagging to be as profitable as zara so
F6R_WTDdx7I,601279,602959,they're trying to do more like what zara
F6R_WTDdx7I,602959,605279,does which as it turns out is crank out
F6R_WTDdx7I,605279,607920,co2 30 faster than the nearest fast
F6R_WTDdx7I,607920,610000,fashion competitor zara manufactured
F6R_WTDdx7I,610000,612959,about 840 million garments this year
F6R_WTDdx7I,612959,615760,about 97 of all the cotton plastic and
F6R_WTDdx7I,615760,617440,metal used in all those garments was
F6R_WTDdx7I,617440,619760,brand new never before used material
F6R_WTDdx7I,619760,622000,made specifically for those garments now
F6R_WTDdx7I,622000,623440,if you remember the intro which feels
F6R_WTDdx7I,623440,626480,like it was so long ago roughly 10 of
F6R_WTDdx7I,626480,628720,fast fashion merchandise is never sold
F6R_WTDdx7I,628720,630800,and just thrown away which means zara
F6R_WTDdx7I,630800,633440,just manufactured roughly 84 million
F6R_WTDdx7I,633440,636079,pieces of trash out of almost entirely
F6R_WTDdx7I,636079,638399,new material all that cotton gone all
F6R_WTDdx7I,638399,640320,that oil extracted to make the plastic
F6R_WTDdx7I,640320,642240,gone all the fossil fuels used to
F6R_WTDdx7I,642240,644560,transport all that material wasted and
F6R_WTDdx7I,644560,646959,for what so we could stock a shelf full
F6R_WTDdx7I,646959,650320,of literal garbage well sheesh daniel
F6R_WTDdx7I,650320,652399,could recycling our clothes maybe help
F6R_WTDdx7I,652399,655600,us out here unfortunately not really see
F6R_WTDdx7I,655600,656959,in the same way that it's cheaper for a
F6R_WTDdx7I,656959,658880,company to make a new plastic bottle
F6R_WTDdx7I,658880,661200,than it is to recycle an old one fast
F6R_WTDdx7I,661200,662800,fashion clothing is this delightful
F6R_WTDdx7I,662800,665200,blend of plastic microfibers and cotton
F6R_WTDdx7I,665200,667200,to give our pants that double baked in
F6R_WTDdx7I,667200,668959,stretch the problem is it takes a lot of
F6R_WTDdx7I,668959,670959,work to separate those plastic fibers
F6R_WTDdx7I,670959,673440,back out which means more workers and
F6R_WTDdx7I,673440,676000,less profits and that's just not gonna
F6R_WTDdx7I,676000,678560,work for these companies that really
F6R_WTDdx7I,678560,680880,love money and at a time when we can't
F6R_WTDdx7I,680880,683600,throw out clothes fast enough zara h m
F6R_WTDdx7I,683600,685279,guess and the other fast fashion super
F6R_WTDdx7I,685279,686640,friends are making billions of
F6R_WTDdx7I,686640,689200,disposable garments every year that's
F6R_WTDdx7I,689200,691040,trillions of gallons of water billions
F6R_WTDdx7I,691040,692640,of barrels of oil airplanes and
F6R_WTDdx7I,692640,694320,freighters crisscrossing the globe to
F6R_WTDdx7I,694320,695920,distribute these disposable clothes
F6R_WTDdx7I,695920,698320,burning fossil fuels at insane rates and
F6R_WTDdx7I,698320,700160,making piles of textile waste in our
F6R_WTDdx7I,700160,702079,landfills and some brands will make the
F6R_WTDdx7I,702079,703839,argument that fast fashion is the only
F6R_WTDdx7I,703839,706079,way poor people can afford to dress well
F6R_WTDdx7I,706079,707920,which is maybe an okay argument if you
F6R_WTDdx7I,707920,709600,hear it and then immediately get kicked
F6R_WTDdx7I,709600,711200,in the head by a mule because if you
F6R_WTDdx7I,711200,712880,think about it for about five seconds
F6R_WTDdx7I,712880,714480,you'll realize their argument is just we
F6R_WTDdx7I,714480,716160,don't want to exploit the poor people we
F6R_WTDdx7I,716160,717920,already exploited when we ship their
F6R_WTDdx7I,717920,719600,jobs overseas by making them pay high
F6R_WTDdx7I,719600,721200,prices for clothes so we're going to go
F6R_WTDdx7I,721200,723200,ahead and exploit the even poorer people
F6R_WTDdx7I,723200,725279,overseas and they really don't want you
F6R_WTDdx7I,725279,726959,to think about the third option which is
F6R_WTDdx7I,726959,729440,hey let's not exploit any poor people
F6R_WTDdx7I,729440,731120,and let's just reduce the profits at the
F6R_WTDdx7I,731120,733839,top by a little bit and also also do you
F6R_WTDdx7I,733839,735519,remember the triangle shirtwaist factory
F6R_WTDdx7I,735519,736720,fire and all those human rights
F6R_WTDdx7I,736720,738959,violations but working conditions are
F6R_WTDdx7I,738959,741040,literally worse than that in dozens of
F6R_WTDdx7I,741040,743519,countries right now hundreds are dead
F6R_WTDdx7I,743519,745440,hundreds more might still be buried
F6R_WTDdx7I,745440,747440,alive after officials in bangladesh say
F6R_WTDdx7I,747440,749440,factory owners ignored and ordered to
F6R_WTDdx7I,749440,753040,evacuate some 400 dead hundreds still
F6R_WTDdx7I,753040,755519,believed to be missing now much better
F6R_WTDdx7I,755519,757120,hosts than me have made much better
F6R_WTDdx7I,757120,758800,videos than this one about the human
F6R_WTDdx7I,758800,760720,rights violation that is just at the
F6R_WTDdx7I,760720,762880,heart of fast fashion and so rather than
F6R_WTDdx7I,762880,764639,butchering all of those i've linked them
F6R_WTDdx7I,764639,766320,in the description and i encourage you
F6R_WTDdx7I,766320,768639,to watch some of them okay okay calm
F6R_WTDdx7I,768639,771040,down dogs i know this script has been
F6R_WTDdx7I,771040,772639,cool it
F6R_WTDdx7I,772639,774560,i know this script has been super super
F6R_WTDdx7I,774560,776000,dark up until this point but we have
F6R_WTDdx7I,776000,778639,officially entered the we have a way out
F6R_WTDdx7I,778639,780800,phase and the big change we need to make
F6R_WTDdx7I,780800,783200,is policy now despite fast fashion
F6R_WTDdx7I,783200,785279,having a documented history of labor
F6R_WTDdx7I,785279,787279,abuse and environmental destruction it
F6R_WTDdx7I,787279,789600,is largely unregulated let me give you
F6R_WTDdx7I,789600,791360,an example a company like gab sub
F6R_WTDdx7I,791360,793440,contracts to a factory in bangladesh
F6R_WTDdx7I,793440,796160,that company uses child labor gap turns
F6R_WTDdx7I,796160,798000,a blind eye until some journalist
F6R_WTDdx7I,798000,801839,figures it out how old are you
F6R_WTDdx7I,802480,804560,do you go to school
F6R_WTDdx7I,804560,806639,gap pretends to be shocked they fire
F6R_WTDdx7I,806639,809040,that subcontractor gap then just gets a
F6R_WTDdx7I,809040,811200,new unregulated subcontractor
F6R_WTDdx7I,811200,812720,you're 14.
F6R_WTDdx7I,812720,814959,and the whole cycle starts again i'm
F6R_WTDdx7I,814959,816959,shocked shocked to find that gambling is
F6R_WTDdx7I,816959,818560,going on in here
F6R_WTDdx7I,818560,820160,you're winning sir oh thank you very
F6R_WTDdx7I,820160,821920,much regulating the supply chain means
F6R_WTDdx7I,821920,823760,passing laws like germany's recent
F6R_WTDdx7I,823760,825760,supply chain due diligence act which
F6R_WTDdx7I,825760,827839,basically forces companies to assess any
F6R_WTDdx7I,827839,829519,human rights and environmental risks in
F6R_WTDdx7I,829519,831199,their supply chain and to establish an
F6R_WTDdx7I,831199,833040,adequate and effective risk management
F6R_WTDdx7I,833040,834480,system now you may have noticed that a
F6R_WTDdx7I,834480,836160,lot of those words haven't exactly been
F6R_WTDdx7I,836160,838240,hitting the gym and the law only forces
F6R_WTDdx7I,838240,840240,companies to make an effort rather than
F6R_WTDdx7I,840240,842320,guarantee they prevent the violations
F6R_WTDdx7I,842320,845279,but compared to america's complete lack
F6R_WTDdx7I,845279,846880,of federal clothing supply chain
F6R_WTDdx7I,846880,848639,legislation they're the god damn
F6R_WTDdx7I,848639,851040,incredible hulk france also passed a law
F6R_WTDdx7I,851040,853279,that requires a carbon label be included
F6R_WTDdx7I,853279,855279,on their textiles but trying to fix a
F6R_WTDdx7I,855279,857680,supply chain from the demand end is like
F6R_WTDdx7I,857680,859680,trying to turn a cruise ship by leaning
F6R_WTDdx7I,859680,861440,really hard to one side there are a
F6R_WTDdx7I,861440,863279,handful of state level supply chain and
F6R_WTDdx7I,863279,864720,manufacturing bills coming through the
F6R_WTDdx7I,864720,866639,pipeline that have similar flavors to
F6R_WTDdx7I,866639,868160,the german one and you can check those
F6R_WTDdx7I,868160,869440,out and throw your support behind them
F6R_WTDdx7I,869440,870880,links in the description and if you're
F6R_WTDdx7I,870880,871920,looking to make a difference on a
F6R_WTDdx7I,871920,874880,personal level surprise you actually can
F6R_WTDdx7I,874880,876720,fast fashion is very much a social
F6R_WTDdx7I,876720,878079,movement and you can be a leader by
F6R_WTDdx7I,878079,879920,moving in the other direction and
F6R_WTDdx7I,879920,881839,refusing to buy fast fashion you can
F6R_WTDdx7I,881839,884720,even use the three r's number one if you
F6R_WTDdx7I,884720,886959,have a big event you can rent an
F6R_WTDdx7I,886959,889440,absolutely bang an outfit or borrow it
F6R_WTDdx7I,889440,890959,from a friend but that counts as the r
F6R_WTDdx7I,890959,892720,from rent and if you need clothes you
F6R_WTDdx7I,892720,895120,can buy pre-owned clothes and i know
F6R_WTDdx7I,895120,896959,that's not exactly starting with r but
F6R_WTDdx7I,896959,898399,that's the best i could do and i'm so
F6R_WTDdx7I,898399,899839,sorry and also if your clothes are
F6R_WTDdx7I,899839,902800,damaged you can repair them okay that's
F6R_WTDdx7I,902800,905199,fun plus you learn a new hobby remember
F6R_WTDdx7I,905199,907040,hobbies is what we used to do before we
F6R_WTDdx7I,907040,909600,had phones those are the three r's baby
F6R_WTDdx7I,909600,912079,hey webb heads a little note here there
F6R_WTDdx7I,912079,914240,is some controversy about that first r
F6R_WTDdx7I,914240,916480,rent a study from environmental research
F6R_WTDdx7I,916480,918240,letters found that in some cases the
F6R_WTDdx7I,918240,920000,extra driving transportation and
F6R_WTDdx7I,920000,921600,frequent dry cleaning makes renting
F6R_WTDdx7I,921600,924240,clothes worse than buying new clothes so
F6R_WTDdx7I,924240,925600,research wherever you're renting from
F6R_WTDdx7I,925600,927519,beforehand or maybe wear something you
F6R_WTDdx7I,927519,929839,already have it looks great i promise
F6R_WTDdx7I,929839,931360,and somebody please tell me a word for
F6R_WTDdx7I,931360,933199,pre-owned that starts with r because i
F6R_WTDdx7I,933199,935360,honestly could not find one anyway shout
F6R_WTDdx7I,935360,937519,out to dana thomas fashion opolis great
F6R_WTDdx7I,937519,938800,book and when it's time to get rid of
F6R_WTDdx7I,938800,940480,your clothes try your best to resell
F6R_WTDdx7I,940480,942079,them or go to clothing swaps or give
F6R_WTDdx7I,942079,944079,them to friends or family i mean you can
F6R_WTDdx7I,944079,946000,still donate them as a last resort but
F6R_WTDdx7I,946000,948399,just know that 90 of what you donate is
F6R_WTDdx7I,948399,949839,probably about to make really good
F6R_WTDdx7I,949839,951680,friends with a seagull at the dome and
F6R_WTDdx7I,951680,953759,if you do have to buy new clothes and
F6R_WTDdx7I,953759,955839,you don't but if you do
F6R_WTDdx7I,955839,958000,you don't but if you do you should buy
F6R_WTDdx7I,958000,959519,from someplace that actually gives a
F6R_WTDdx7I,959519,961600,[ __ ] about their supply and manufacture
F6R_WTDdx7I,961600,963839,so the next time futureyou just has to
F6R_WTDdx7I,963839,965519,buy something consider starting by
F6R_WTDdx7I,965519,967360,researching the brand you're buying from
F6R_WTDdx7I,967360,969279,or by using a third-party source like
F6R_WTDdx7I,969279,971680,united by xero now i offered to plug
F6R_WTDdx7I,971680,974560,united by zero for free but those dorks
F6R_WTDdx7I,974560,977440,literally paid me to shout them out
F6R_WTDdx7I,977440,979759,right here this is it 15 minutes into a
F6R_WTDdx7I,979759,982639,video they paid me for this
F6R_WTDdx7I,982639,984399,insane but just so they get their
F6R_WTDdx7I,984399,986480,money's worth united by zero aggregates
F6R_WTDdx7I,986480,988079,a bunch of independent brands that are
F6R_WTDdx7I,988079,990000,vetted by actual scientists and are
F6R_WTDdx7I,990000,992160,either up cycled or made to order or
F6R_WTDdx7I,992160,994480,economically circular or just generally
F6R_WTDdx7I,994480,995839,produced in a more thoughtful
F6R_WTDdx7I,995839,997839,sustainable lower carbon way they have a
F6R_WTDdx7I,997839,999440,whole website you can scroll through and
F6R_WTDdx7I,999440,1000880,check out if you feel like it but the
F6R_WTDdx7I,1000880,1002639,bottom line is that companies are going
F6R_WTDdx7I,1002639,1004639,to chase after customers so if you as a
F6R_WTDdx7I,1004639,1006639,customer place more of an emphasis on
F6R_WTDdx7I,1006639,1008959,measurable sustainability companies are
F6R_WTDdx7I,1008959,1011040,going to try to cater to you so first
