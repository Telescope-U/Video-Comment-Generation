sdXe4ABdkOg,960,3120,this is the toyota chr
sdXe4ABdkOg,3120,5759,and it's a bit like one of these a prius
sdXe4ABdkOg,5759,6399,because
sdXe4ABdkOg,6399,8400,it's a hybrid so it's got loads of tech
sdXe4ABdkOg,8400,10320,designed to save you money on petrol and
sdXe4ABdkOg,10320,12880,also reduce emissions but thankfully it
sdXe4ABdkOg,12880,14320,doesn't look like a prius
sdXe4ABdkOg,14320,15519,so you're not likely to have people
sdXe4ABdkOg,15519,17279,knocking on the window mistaking you for
sdXe4ABdkOg,17279,17520,an
sdXe4ABdkOg,17520,19840,uber driver in fact particularly if you
sdXe4ABdkOg,19840,21600,go for this new gl sport version
sdXe4ABdkOg,21600,24800,they're far more likely to be saying
sdXe4ABdkOg,24800,27920,nice car mate but is the chr actually
sdXe4ABdkOg,27920,28880,any good
sdXe4ABdkOg,28880,29920,well that's what we're going to be
sdXe4ABdkOg,29920,31840,finding out in this video so stay with
sdXe4ABdkOg,31840,32880,us and i'll tell you
sdXe4ABdkOg,32880,34880,everything you need to know about the
sdXe4ABdkOg,34880,36640,car and if you decide you want to buy
sdXe4ABdkOg,36640,37360,one of these
sdXe4ABdkOg,37360,39120,make sure you head over to our website
sdXe4ABdkOg,39120,40719,whatcar.com because we could save you
sdXe4ABdkOg,40719,42800,more than 2 000 pounds
sdXe4ABdkOg,42800,45280,on the brochure price right now so
sdXe4ABdkOg,45280,46559,that's the plug out of the way
sdXe4ABdkOg,46559,49600,let's get on with the review
sdXe4ABdkOg,53199,55440,now the chr has been around for a few
sdXe4ABdkOg,55440,58239,years it was launched back in 2016.
sdXe4ABdkOg,58239,60559,and although there was a facelift around
sdXe4ABdkOg,60559,61520,a year ago
sdXe4ABdkOg,61520,63199,the overall look of the car hasn't
sdXe4ABdkOg,63199,65360,really changed a great deal
sdXe4ABdkOg,65360,68240,but this gr sport version is new and i
sdXe4ABdkOg,68240,70000,should probably explain what gl sport is
sdXe4ABdkOg,70000,70960,all about
sdXe4ABdkOg,70960,74000,so gr stands for kazoo racing and it's
sdXe4ABdkOg,74000,75840,toyota's motorsport division
sdXe4ABdkOg,75840,77680,and the gr badge is also worn by
sdXe4ABdkOg,77680,79520,toyota's fastest road-going cars at the
sdXe4ABdkOg,79520,80080,moment
sdXe4ABdkOg,80080,83040,those are the gl supra and the gr yaris
sdXe4ABdkOg,83040,84240,that's actually the best hot hatch you
sdXe4ABdkOg,84240,85280,can buy at the moment
sdXe4ABdkOg,85280,86400,and if you want to watch our video
sdXe4ABdkOg,86400,88159,review of that just click the link up
sdXe4ABdkOg,88159,89520,there at the top
sdXe4ABdkOg,89520,92240,gr sport basically means you get the
sdXe4ABdkOg,92240,93280,sporty looks
sdXe4ABdkOg,93280,95439,but without any extra power or higher
sdXe4ABdkOg,95439,96560,running costs so
sdXe4ABdkOg,96560,99040,it's a bit like ms sport is to bmw or
sdXe4ABdkOg,99040,99680,s-line
sdXe4ABdkOg,99680,102960,is to audi and if you go for a gl sport
sdXe4ABdkOg,102960,103759,version
sdXe4ABdkOg,103759,107520,of the chr you get these bespoke
sdXe4ABdkOg,107520,110799,19-inch two-tone alloys you also get a
sdXe4ABdkOg,110799,111439,black
sdXe4ABdkOg,111439,114320,roof and you get a darker tint to the
sdXe4ABdkOg,114320,115439,headlight lenses
sdXe4ABdkOg,115439,118240,as well on top of that there is this all
sdXe4ABdkOg,118240,119439,black or dark chrome
sdXe4ABdkOg,119439,122240,as toyota calls it front grille here
sdXe4ABdkOg,122240,123840,there is also sport suspension we talk
sdXe4ABdkOg,123840,125119,about how that affects ride and handling
sdXe4ABdkOg,125119,127360,when we go for a drive a bit later on
sdXe4ABdkOg,127360,128720,and we'll also run you through the
sdXe4ABdkOg,128720,130479,interior upgrades as well
sdXe4ABdkOg,130479,132400,now the chr is actually a bigger car
sdXe4ABdkOg,132400,134239,than it might look it takes up
sdXe4ABdkOg,134239,136000,roughly the same amount of space on the
sdXe4ABdkOg,136000,137920,road as a skoda car rock
sdXe4ABdkOg,137920,139920,so theoretically it should be a
sdXe4ABdkOg,139920,142879,practical family car but it isn't
sdXe4ABdkOg,142879,144959,because somehow toyota has taken all
sdXe4ABdkOg,144959,146000,that space
sdXe4ABdkOg,146000,148560,and packaged it in such a way that well
sdXe4ABdkOg,148560,150239,you can see for yourself really
sdXe4ABdkOg,150239,152000,yes i'm reasonably tall i'm just over
sdXe4ABdkOg,152000,153680,six foot and this seat in front here
sdXe4ABdkOg,153680,155360,that's set up for my driving position
sdXe4ABdkOg,155360,156080,but
sdXe4ABdkOg,156080,158319,i don't really have any knee room at all
sdXe4ABdkOg,158319,160160,and although there are head rests
sdXe4ABdkOg,160160,161360,for someone of my height they're
sdXe4ABdkOg,161360,163760,pointless because if i lean back
sdXe4ABdkOg,163760,166560,it just hits the ceiling and things get
sdXe4ABdkOg,166560,168000,even worse when you close the door
sdXe4ABdkOg,168000,169040,because
sdXe4ABdkOg,169040,171280,i've got a big pillar here by the side
sdXe4ABdkOg,171280,173200,of my head and these small side windows
sdXe4ABdkOg,173200,174239,they don't let very much
sdXe4ABdkOg,174239,175599,light into the car at all so it feels
sdXe4ABdkOg,175599,177599,quite claustrophobic back here it's also
sdXe4ABdkOg,177599,179280,worth knowing that cars like the ford
sdXe4ABdkOg,179280,181360,puma and nissan juke even though they're
sdXe4ABdkOg,181360,183280,smaller than this in terms of exterior
sdXe4ABdkOg,183280,184640,dimensions
sdXe4ABdkOg,184640,186720,they have a similar amount of space in
sdXe4ABdkOg,186720,188400,the back they're cheaper as well we'll
sdXe4ABdkOg,188400,190159,talk about how much the chr costs a bit
sdXe4ABdkOg,190159,191280,later on
sdXe4ABdkOg,191280,193120,but if you only plan for adults in the
sdXe4ABdkOg,193120,194560,back occasionally
sdXe4ABdkOg,194560,196560,or you've got young kids in child seats
sdXe4ABdkOg,196560,198159,you get ice fix mounts
sdXe4ABdkOg,198159,199680,as standard on the outer rear seats in
sdXe4ABdkOg,199680,201840,the chr then that isn't going to be a
sdXe4ABdkOg,201840,204159,deal breaker for you
sdXe4ABdkOg,204159,206239,and given that rear passenger space
sdXe4ABdkOg,206239,208239,clearly wasn't a priority when toyota
sdXe4ABdkOg,208239,209599,designed the chr
sdXe4ABdkOg,209599,211599,it probably won't surprise you that boot
sdXe4ABdkOg,211599,213840,space wasn't either
sdXe4ABdkOg,213840,215840,so there's less space in here than
sdXe4ABdkOg,215840,218319,you'll find in boxier family suvs
sdXe4ABdkOg,218319,220959,like the skoda rock and if you're
sdXe4ABdkOg,220959,222239,thinking well yes
sdXe4ABdkOg,222239,224239,but i don't want something boxy and
sdXe4ABdkOg,224239,226080,arguably a little bit boring
sdXe4ABdkOg,226080,228080,then remember that you can get something
sdXe4ABdkOg,228080,229440,like a koopa for mentor
sdXe4ABdkOg,229440,231200,that certainly isn't dull to look at and
sdXe4ABdkOg,231200,233040,that has more luggage space than this
sdXe4ABdkOg,233040,236000,as well also a little bit disappointing
sdXe4ABdkOg,236000,237439,is that there's no height adjustable
sdXe4ABdkOg,237439,239280,boot floor so you've got this big drop
sdXe4ABdkOg,239280,242080,down from the entrance and there are no
sdXe4ABdkOg,242080,243840,handles on the walls of the boot either
sdXe4ABdkOg,243840,245360,for remotely folding
sdXe4ABdkOg,245360,246799,down the rear seats you have to walk
sdXe4ABdkOg,246799,248879,round to the passenger area again
sdXe4ABdkOg,248879,251920,and pull them forward yourself
sdXe4ABdkOg,251920,254159,and when you do that you're left with
sdXe4ABdkOg,254159,255280,quite a big step
sdXe4ABdkOg,255280,257120,in the floor of the extended load base
sdXe4ABdkOg,257120,258959,so clearly usability
sdXe4ABdkOg,258959,261120,hasn't been thought about that much but
sdXe4ABdkOg,261120,262479,whether that bothers you
sdXe4ABdkOg,262479,264320,really comes down to your own lifestyle
sdXe4ABdkOg,264320,268160,and your personal needs
sdXe4ABdkOg,268160,269360,fortunately when you're sitting in the
sdXe4ABdkOg,269360,271199,front things are much better it's
sdXe4ABdkOg,271199,273120,actually quite roomy in here and you
sdXe4ABdkOg,273120,274400,feel like you're in something a little
sdXe4ABdkOg,274400,276080,bit taller than a regular hatchback
sdXe4ABdkOg,276080,276639,which
sdXe4ABdkOg,276639,278960,you don't in cars like the skoda kamek
sdXe4ABdkOg,278960,280080,for example
sdXe4ABdkOg,280080,282000,and there's also a reasonable storage
sdXe4ABdkOg,282000,283440,space as well you've got a
sdXe4ABdkOg,283440,285759,rubberized tray here for your mobile
sdXe4ABdkOg,285759,286479,phone
sdXe4ABdkOg,286479,288160,a cup holder just behind it here and
sdXe4ABdkOg,288160,290240,another one actually is quite deep
sdXe4ABdkOg,290240,293199,behind the gear lever and if you lift up
sdXe4ABdkOg,293199,294560,the front center armrest
sdXe4ABdkOg,294560,296960,you'll find quite a big cubby below
sdXe4ABdkOg,296960,298320,there as well
sdXe4ABdkOg,298320,301360,the door pockets they're fairly narrow
sdXe4ABdkOg,301360,303120,but you still fit a 500ml bottle of
sdXe4ABdkOg,303120,305600,water there quite easily so overall
sdXe4ABdkOg,305600,308479,pretty good for a car in this class the
sdXe4ABdkOg,308479,310000,air conditioning controls
sdXe4ABdkOg,310000,312400,they are a little bit fiddly because
sdXe4ABdkOg,312400,313120,you've got these
sdXe4ABdkOg,313120,314400,rocker switches here that you sort of
sdXe4ABdkOg,314400,316479,need to nudge up and down to change the
sdXe4ABdkOg,316479,318160,interior temperature and i think
sdXe4ABdkOg,318160,319520,toyota has probably acknowledged that
sdXe4ABdkOg,319520,321520,actually because it's more recent models
sdXe4ABdkOg,321520,323280,like the yaris the corolla
sdXe4ABdkOg,323280,325840,and the highlander they've reverted to
sdXe4ABdkOg,325840,327120,twist knobs for adjusting the
sdXe4ABdkOg,327120,328320,temperature but
sdXe4ABdkOg,328320,330639,certainly this setup is much much better
sdXe4ABdkOg,330639,332240,than having everything
sdXe4ABdkOg,332240,334160,in the touchscreen which a lot of cars
sdXe4ABdkOg,334160,336800,have these days or for that matter
sdXe4ABdkOg,336800,338639,silly touch sensitive slider pads that
sdXe4ABdkOg,338639,340320,you get in the coop before mentor
sdXe4ABdkOg,340320,344080,they are absolutely terrible and quality
sdXe4ABdkOg,344080,345680,at least compared with mainstream rivals
sdXe4ABdkOg,345680,347360,in this class is really good as well
sdXe4ABdkOg,347360,350000,so you've got a lot of soft touch
sdXe4ABdkOg,350000,353199,materials here and on the dashboard
sdXe4ABdkOg,353199,356560,and piano black as well and even this
sdXe4ABdkOg,356560,358000,sort of funky
sdXe4ABdkOg,358000,359600,diamond pattern on the inside of the
sdXe4ABdkOg,359600,361120,doors here that's been given a
sdXe4ABdkOg,361120,363120,rubberized finish so it feels a bit more
sdXe4ABdkOg,363120,365039,up mark a bit more expensive than it
sdXe4ABdkOg,365039,368400,would do if it was just hard plastic
sdXe4ABdkOg,368400,370479,the infotainment system though that is
sdXe4ABdkOg,370479,371680,more of a mixed bag
sdXe4ABdkOg,371680,373759,let's start with the positives so the
sdXe4ABdkOg,373759,376080,screen is quite high up on the dashboard
sdXe4ABdkOg,376080,377600,so i have to look down
sdXe4ABdkOg,377600,380319,too far to see it and it's also angled
sdXe4ABdkOg,380319,381280,towards the driver
sdXe4ABdkOg,381280,384240,again that is a good thing there are
sdXe4ABdkOg,384240,385440,shortcut keys here
sdXe4ABdkOg,385440,388000,as well they are useful although i'm not
sdXe4ABdkOg,388000,389360,sure why they could be made a bit bigger
sdXe4ABdkOg,389360,389840,because
sdXe4ABdkOg,389840,391360,there's clearly space for bigger buttons
sdXe4ABdkOg,391360,392639,here and they would be easier to find
sdXe4ABdkOg,392639,394080,when you're driving but
sdXe4ABdkOg,394080,396400,the downside is that toyota's operating
sdXe4ABdkOg,396400,398400,system isn't very good
sdXe4ABdkOg,398400,400479,so not only does it look like it was
sdXe4ABdkOg,400479,402479,designed in about 1999 the graphics
sdXe4ABdkOg,402479,402960,aren't
sdXe4ABdkOg,402960,405520,great at all it's just sometimes a
sdXe4ABdkOg,405520,407039,little bit slow to respond
sdXe4ABdkOg,407039,409680,and also certain functions there are
sdXe4ABdkOg,409680,411280,more steps than you really
sdXe4ABdkOg,411280,414800,think are necessary you can just bypass
sdXe4ABdkOg,414800,416319,it completely and use your phone
sdXe4ABdkOg,416319,418240,though you get apple carplay and android
sdXe4ABdkOg,418240,420400,auto standard on the chr
sdXe4ABdkOg,420400,423120,and to be honest i use that all the time
sdXe4ABdkOg,423120,423440,the
sdXe4ABdkOg,423440,425919,only downside is that you obviously do
sdXe4ABdkOg,425919,427680,need a data connection your phone to use
sdXe4ABdkOg,427680,428400,things like
sdXe4ABdkOg,428400,431120,the sat nav so if you go into an area
sdXe4ABdkOg,431120,432240,with no signal you
sdXe4ABdkOg,432240,434560,might not know where you're going and
sdXe4ABdkOg,434560,436000,now's probably a good time actually
sdXe4ABdkOg,436000,437360,to give you a run through the different
sdXe4ABdkOg,437360,439520,trim levels because if you go for entry
sdXe4ABdkOg,439520,441280,level icon trim then you don't
sdXe4ABdkOg,441280,443759,get a built in sat nav so you are forced
sdXe4ABdkOg,443759,445120,to use your phone
sdXe4ABdkOg,445120,447199,you also don't get rain sensing wipers
sdXe4ABdkOg,447199,448639,so that's a bit of a shame
sdXe4ABdkOg,448639,451039,but you do get adaptive cruise control
sdXe4ABdkOg,451039,452960,dual zone climate control a reversing
sdXe4ABdkOg,452960,455120,camera and led headlights
sdXe4ABdkOg,455120,457440,it also keeps the price respectable so
sdXe4ABdkOg,457440,459039,it's actually our favorite trim
sdXe4ABdkOg,459039,460400,and there are several packs you can add
sdXe4ABdkOg,460400,462319,if you want a bit more kit
sdXe4ABdkOg,462319,464240,dynamic trim is worth considering as
sdXe4ABdkOg,464240,465360,well that adds
sdXe4ABdkOg,465360,467759,built-in nav and automatic wipers but
sdXe4ABdkOg,467759,469599,also front and rear parking sensors
sdXe4ABdkOg,469599,472080,heated seats keyless entry and bigger
sdXe4ABdkOg,472080,472800,alloys
sdXe4ABdkOg,472800,474720,and then right at the top of the range
sdXe4ABdkOg,474720,477919,there's this gr sport and xl as well
sdXe4ABdkOg,477919,478960,both trims cost
sdXe4ABdkOg,478960,481360,exactly the same but xl that's more
sdXe4ABdkOg,481360,482960,about luxury so you get leather seats
sdXe4ABdkOg,482960,484560,and a heated steering wheel
sdXe4ABdkOg,484560,486800,whereas in the gr sport you get the
sdXe4ABdkOg,486800,488400,sporty looks on the outside that i
sdXe4ABdkOg,488400,489520,mentioned earlier
sdXe4ABdkOg,489520,491840,but also a few more gr badges on the
sdXe4ABdkOg,491840,492639,inside
sdXe4ABdkOg,492639,494800,and a perforated leather steering wheel
sdXe4ABdkOg,494800,497520,with this red stitching
sdXe4ABdkOg,497520,499199,now there's a saying here in britain all
sdXe4ABdkOg,499199,500560,mouth and no trousers
sdXe4ABdkOg,500560,502479,and it's appropriate for describing the
sdXe4ABdkOg,502479,505280,chr or this particular version at least
sdXe4ABdkOg,505280,507599,it means that you can talk a good game
sdXe4ABdkOg,507599,509840,which the gl sport does with its sporty
sdXe4ABdkOg,509840,510720,body kit
sdXe4ABdkOg,510720,513120,and big alloys but you can't back that
sdXe4ABdkOg,513120,515120,up with any real substance and here
sdXe4ABdkOg,515120,517919,that means with any performance so this
sdXe4ABdkOg,517919,518320,car
sdXe4ABdkOg,518320,520320,has the cheaper of two hybrid
sdXe4ABdkOg,520320,523039,powertrains it pairs a 1.8 liter petrol
sdXe4ABdkOg,523039,524159,engine with an electric motor it's
sdXe4ABdkOg,524159,525680,essentially borrowed from the toyota
sdXe4ABdkOg,525680,526800,prius
sdXe4ABdkOg,526800,529440,and it gives acceleration that isn't
sdXe4ABdkOg,529440,530880,very fast at all
sdXe4ABdkOg,530880,532320,this car would actually struggle to beat
sdXe4ABdkOg,532320,534000,the dalton sandero in
sdXe4ABdkOg,534000,536399,a drag race so it isn't the best choice
sdXe4ABdkOg,536399,537760,if you spend a lot of your time driving
sdXe4ABdkOg,537760,539519,on motorways and arrows
sdXe4ABdkOg,539519,541200,and because of the type of automatic
sdXe4ABdkOg,541200,543040,gearbox it has called a cvt
sdXe4ABdkOg,543040,546160,it can also be quite noisy so if you
sdXe4ABdkOg,546160,547519,push the accelerator pedal down more
sdXe4ABdkOg,547519,549360,than the first few centimeters
sdXe4ABdkOg,549360,550959,then the engine would have suddenly
sdXe4ABdkOg,550959,553279,shoot up and unlike in a conventional
sdXe4ABdkOg,553279,554240,automatic
sdXe4ABdkOg,554240,556720,where the revs rise and fall as the car
sdXe4ABdkOg,556720,558320,changes up through the gears
sdXe4ABdkOg,558320,560880,here they just stay high until you're up
sdXe4ABdkOg,560880,562480,to the speed you want to be doing which
sdXe4ABdkOg,562480,564880,can take quite a long time it's
sdXe4ABdkOg,564880,566160,absolutely fine when you're driving in
sdXe4ABdkOg,566160,566800,the town
sdXe4ABdkOg,566800,569040,and suburbs though and actually at very
sdXe4ABdkOg,569040,571120,low speeds for short distances
sdXe4ABdkOg,571120,572880,this car can actually drive itself along
sdXe4ABdkOg,572880,574399,using just this electric
sdXe4ABdkOg,574399,576399,motor and you can encourage it to do
sdXe4ABdkOg,576399,578720,that by pressing this ev mode button
sdXe4ABdkOg,578720,580160,down here
sdXe4ABdkOg,580160,582160,but you do have to be very very gentle
sdXe4ABdkOg,582160,583360,with the accelerator pedal because
sdXe4ABdkOg,583360,584959,anything more and the petrol engine will
sdXe4ABdkOg,584959,586240,just fire itself up
sdXe4ABdkOg,586240,588000,anyway the whole point of having a
sdXe4ABdkOg,588000,589680,hybrid is to save fuel
sdXe4ABdkOg,589680,591760,and there's no doubt that the chr is
sdXe4ABdkOg,591760,593600,more efficient than most of its rivals
sdXe4ABdkOg,593600,595680,even diesels and i'm not just talking
sdXe4ABdkOg,595680,597360,about the official figures
sdXe4ABdkOg,597360,599920,in our real world tests the 1.8 hybrid
sdXe4ABdkOg,599920,601680,averaged more than 50 mpg
sdXe4ABdkOg,601680,603920,proving particularly frugal on the town
sdXe4ABdkOg,603920,605200,part of the test
sdXe4ABdkOg,605200,607040,there is also a two liter hybrid that's
sdXe4ABdkOg,607040,608560,very nearly as efficient and it should
sdXe4ABdkOg,608560,610079,be a no-brainer because
sdXe4ABdkOg,610079,612560,it's more powerful so it gives the chr
sdXe4ABdkOg,612560,614240,better acceleration
sdXe4ABdkOg,614240,615600,the only thing that stops us from
sdXe4ABdkOg,615600,618000,recommending it is the price the chr
sdXe4ABdkOg,618000,620079,is pretty expensive and going for the 2
sdXe4ABdkOg,620079,622640,litre adds another 1600 or so to the
sdXe4ABdkOg,622640,623279,cost
sdXe4ABdkOg,623279,625440,or about 30 pounds a month on a typical
sdXe4ABdkOg,625440,626720,pcp plan
sdXe4ABdkOg,626720,628959,you also can't have it with entry level
sdXe4ABdkOg,628959,630720,icon trim which is our pick so
sdXe4ABdkOg,630720,632560,that's another reason you might want to
sdXe4ABdkOg,632560,635760,stick with the 1.8
sdXe4ABdkOg,636880,639120,now as i said earlier gl sport models
sdXe4ABdkOg,639120,640880,get small suspension
sdXe4ABdkOg,640880,642240,and if you want to get really technical
sdXe4ABdkOg,642240,643920,that means the springs are 10
sdXe4ABdkOg,643920,646480,stiffer at the front and 15 stiffer at
sdXe4ABdkOg,646480,648399,the rear and if you go for this 1.8
sdXe4ABdkOg,648399,649360,liter model
sdXe4ABdkOg,649360,651279,you also get a stiffer anti-roll bar as
sdXe4ABdkOg,651279,653200,well it's usually only found on the two
sdXe4ABdkOg,653200,654399,liter models
sdXe4ABdkOg,654399,656720,and it all helps make the chr feel a
sdXe4ABdkOg,656720,658160,little bit more agile through corners
sdXe4ABdkOg,658160,659360,and it reduces
sdXe4ABdkOg,659360,662000,nosedive under braking as well and you
sdXe4ABdkOg,662000,663040,can tell that
sdXe4ABdkOg,663040,664880,time and money has been spent on setting
sdXe4ABdkOg,664880,666160,everything up because
sdXe4ABdkOg,666160,668959,compared with most other family suvs the
sdXe4ABdkOg,668959,670320,chr handles
sdXe4ABdkOg,670320,673279,really well it's very composed and the
sdXe4ABdkOg,673279,674880,steering that's actually been tuned
sdXe4ABdkOg,674880,676079,slightly differently
sdXe4ABdkOg,676079,679440,on gr sport models as well it feels
sdXe4ABdkOg,679440,681040,naturally weighted it gives you
sdXe4ABdkOg,681040,683040,plenty of confidence and it does make
sdXe4ABdkOg,683040,684480,you scratch your head
sdXe4ABdkOg,684480,686399,it's a bit like volkswagen investing a
sdXe4ABdkOg,686399,688640,load of money making the next golf gti
sdXe4ABdkOg,688640,689760,as good to drive
sdXe4ABdkOg,689760,692399,as it possibly could be and then fitting
sdXe4ABdkOg,692399,693279,it with the engine
sdXe4ABdkOg,693279,696160,from a lawnmower okay that's a bit of an
sdXe4ABdkOg,696160,698079,extreme example but you get the point
sdXe4ABdkOg,698079,700240,the chr feels like it deserves a more
sdXe4ABdkOg,700240,701519,powerful engine
sdXe4ABdkOg,701519,703680,and also a gearbox that isn't just
sdXe4ABdkOg,703680,705279,focused on fuel economy but
sdXe4ABdkOg,705279,706959,it's focused a bit more on drivability
sdXe4ABdkOg,706959,709360,as well
sdXe4ABdkOg,709600,711760,the ride is also very sophisticated for
sdXe4ABdkOg,711760,713279,a car in this class
sdXe4ABdkOg,713279,715680,it's fairly firm but if you hit a bump
sdXe4ABdkOg,715680,717120,even a nasty pothole
sdXe4ABdkOg,717120,719360,the car doesn't skip sideways it stays
sdXe4ABdkOg,719360,721760,composed it's very well judged
sdXe4ABdkOg,721760,723920,it just has a slightly sporty edge to it
sdXe4ABdkOg,723920,726240,compared with say a skoda carot that's
sdXe4ABdkOg,726240,729440,softer and altogether more wallowy and
sdXe4ABdkOg,729440,731200,actually you don't need to go for a gl
sdXe4ABdkOg,731200,732800,sport version to get
sdXe4ABdkOg,732800,734480,a chr that's good to drive because even
sdXe4ABdkOg,734480,736800,the lesser versions are very good
sdXe4ABdkOg,736800,739200,compared with most cars in this class
sdXe4ABdkOg,739200,740800,and as we suggested earlier
sdXe4ABdkOg,740800,743120,we probably wouldn't go for a gr sport
sdXe4ABdkOg,743120,744480,as tempting as it is
sdXe4ABdkOg,744480,746800,it's a bit expensive it starts at more
sdXe4ABdkOg,746800,749440,than 31 000 pounds and
sdXe4ABdkOg,749440,751440,if you want the 2-liter engine some
sdXe4ABdkOg,751440,753519,alcantara seats and an upgraded sound
sdXe4ABdkOg,753519,755040,system you'll be spending
sdXe4ABdkOg,755040,758240,around 35 000 pounds that sort of money
sdXe4ABdkOg,758240,760240,would get you a really nice volvo xc40
sdXe4ABdkOg,760240,762000,which isn't just a bigger car
sdXe4ABdkOg,762000,764800,it's also a better one in most areas as
sdXe4ABdkOg,764800,766480,well but
sdXe4ABdkOg,766480,767519,if you're not too bothered about
sdXe4ABdkOg,767519,769040,practicality and you really like the way
sdXe4ABdkOg,769040,770560,the chr looks
sdXe4ABdkOg,770560,772160,then the cheaper versions particularly
sdXe4ABdkOg,772160,774079,with this 1.8 liter engine
sdXe4ABdkOg,774079,776959,make a pretty good buy but for lots more
sdXe4ABdkOg,776959,778480,information about the chr
