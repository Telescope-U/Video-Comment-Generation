_OFoyKXULN4,13920,15920,card to this bakery before we started i
_OFoyKXULN4,15920,17840,had them all make cake art without any
_OFoyKXULN4,17840,19600,prior knowledge and training this is
_OFoyKXULN4,19600,21359,michelle she is a professional cake

_OFoyKXULN4,25039,26960,semester without further ado for lesson
_OFoyKXULN4,26960,28560,number one michelle will teach you how
_OFoyKXULN4,28560,31039,to make icing the first rule when making
_OFoyKXULN4,31039,32558,buttercream icing is that you want your
_OFoyKXULN4,32558,34399,butter completely at room temperature
_OFoyKXULN4,34399,36000,the second ingredient i'm adding is a
_OFoyKXULN4,36000,37680,little bit of shortening we're going to
_OFoyKXULN4,37680,40480,mix those two ingredients first
_OFoyKXULN4,40480,41760,now we're going to add the powdered
_OFoyKXULN4,41760,43840,sugar there'll be five cups of powdered
_OFoyKXULN4,43840,46160,sugar total that's a lot of sugar so
_OFoyKXULN4,46160,47680,these are egg whites we're about to put
_OFoyKXULN4,47680,49840,that in with some vanilla extract so
_OFoyKXULN4,49840,51360,when they're making their icing what are
_OFoyKXULN4,51360,53440,things you're looking for i'm looking
_OFoyKXULN4,53440,55760,for right measurements the way that it's
_OFoyKXULN4,55760,57600,incorporated to make sure that it's
_OFoyKXULN4,57600,59520,being done accurately everyone back to
_OFoyKXULN4,59520,61280,your seats we're going to start so for

_OFoyKXULN4,64800,66080,[Music]
_OFoyKXULN4,66080,67600,time to make the best buttercream ever
_OFoyKXULN4,67600,69600,created half a pound so you need eight
_OFoyKXULN4,69600,71280,wow i should be telling you guys this we
_OFoyKXULN4,71280,73119,need two of these it should be just red
_OFoyKXULN4,73119,74880,one so it wasn't one panel shortening it
_OFoyKXULN4,74880,76400,should have been half a pound it was
_OFoyKXULN4,76400,80080,half a pound nobody else knows that
_OFoyKXULN4,82240,84400,finally finished microwaving my butter i
_OFoyKXULN4,84400,86400,know it's not a race but i am ahead of
_OFoyKXULN4,86400,88240,everyone right now now i'm going to
_OFoyKXULN4,88240,90400,start mixing you guys might be wondering
_OFoyKXULN4,90400,92320,why isn't ben in this challenge ben is
_OFoyKXULN4,92320,94960,allergic to dairy he's allergic to eggs
_OFoyKXULN4,94960,96560,if he can pronounce the name he's
_OFoyKXULN4,96560,99770,probably allergic to it
_OFoyKXULN4,99770,102859,[Music]
_OFoyKXULN4,104000,106000,this is the nastiest thing that's ever
_OFoyKXULN4,106000,107920,happened to me i kind of followed
_OFoyKXULN4,107920,109920,everything to the tea it looks pretty
_OFoyKXULN4,109920,111600,white it looks pretty creamy and it
_OFoyKXULN4,111600,113759,tastes really good your icing is looking
_OFoyKXULN4,113759,115520,pretty nice thank you i don't know what
_OFoyKXULN4,115520,116799,i'm doing michelle how do you think
_OFoyKXULN4,116799,118799,you're doing so far well i'm finished
_OFoyKXULN4,118799,121040,michelle so they have all made their own
_OFoyKXULN4,121040,123360,icing now and won't you go around take a
_OFoyKXULN4,123360,125439,look and you can let me know which two
_OFoyKXULN4,125439,129399,perform the best in the class
_OFoyKXULN4,130640,132400,so which two of your students over here
_OFoyKXULN4,132400,135439,do you think perform the best
_OFoyKXULN4,135520,137680,that means one point for michelle one
_OFoyKXULN4,137680,139040,point for nick and i was just going off
_OFoyKXULN4,139040,140480,taste and obviously my taste buds are
_OFoyKXULN4,140480,142080,waxed honestly my frosting is really
_OFoyKXULN4,142080,143680,good yo ben you should try this yeah if
_OFoyKXULN4,143680,144800,you want to send me a plate like a
_OFoyKXULN4,144800,146879,balloon just gotta ask who performed the
_OFoyKXULN4,146879,149040,worst i am sorry i am gonna pick you
_OFoyKXULN4,149040,151599,because it was the saltiest
_OFoyKXULN4,151599,153040,i actually didn't tell you guys earlier
_OFoyKXULN4,153040,155040,there is a twist if you're the worst one
_OFoyKXULN4,155040,156879,in each lesson you get negative one
_OFoyKXULN4,156879,158640,point that means jake
_OFoyKXULN4,158640,161120,you are now at negative one point so i
_OFoyKXULN4,161120,163440,have to win one to get back to zero yes
_OFoyKXULN4,163440,164879,and with that being said let's go to our
_OFoyKXULN4,164879,166800,second lesson michelle will teach you
_OFoyKXULN4,166800,168959,guys how to stack and shape cakes the
_OFoyKXULN4,168959,170959,first thing you want to do is level it
_OFoyKXULN4,170959,172480,it's going in a circle
_OFoyKXULN4,172480,174560,just kind of spread it to the outside
_OFoyKXULN4,174560,176800,that's so pretty
_OFoyKXULN4,176800,178159,because when you guys spread your icing
_OFoyKXULN4,178159,182760,it better look that satisfying oh
_OFoyKXULN4,184080,186480,look at that corner it's so clean i will
_OFoyKXULN4,186480,188400,give you guys five minutes to make your
_OFoyKXULN4,188400,191200,cake look like that
_OFoyKXULN4,192800,196239,that's pretty flat to me
_OFoyKXULN4,196239,197840,oh you realize when you cut it there
_OFoyKXULN4,197840,200239,weren't that many crumbs i'm looking for
_OFoyKXULN4,200239,202560,a clean finish even if it has crumbs in
_OFoyKXULN4,202560,204799,it that's okay it just needs to have
_OFoyKXULN4,204799,206720,straight edges nick is doing a good job
_OFoyKXULN4,206720,208480,down there cake looks pretty level i
_OFoyKXULN4,208480,210159,think david and nick are in the lead so
_OFoyKXULN4,210159,212480,far oh my god you do that i'm a cream
_OFoyKXULN4,212480,213519,master
_OFoyKXULN4,213519,215360,i'm so nervous for them a lot of these
_OFoyKXULN4,215360,217200,look really rough i have no idea how
_OFoyKXULN4,217200,218720,michelle finished this in like five
_OFoyKXULN4,218720,220239,minutes three
_OFoyKXULN4,220239,221040,two
_OFoyKXULN4,221040,223280,one everyone stop what you're doing the
_OFoyKXULN4,223280,224959,top layer should have been turned the
_OFoyKXULN4,224959,226480,other way yeah
_OFoyKXULN4,226480,227840,it just needs to be cleaned up a little
_OFoyKXULN4,227840,229519,bit on the sides but
_OFoyKXULN4,229519,232159,overall good shape and the sides aren't
_OFoyKXULN4,232159,234159,completely finished you can still see
_OFoyKXULN4,234159,235599,through the middle of the cake so it
_OFoyKXULN4,235599,238159,just needs more icing and more finishing
_OFoyKXULN4,238159,240319,do you appreciate how level your top was
_OFoyKXULN4,240319,241599,working really well i think with a
_OFoyKXULN4,241599,243599,little more time you would have gotten
_OFoyKXULN4,243599,245680,the edges cleaner without michelle's
_OFoyKXULN4,245680,247920,expertise i think david has the
_OFoyKXULN4,247920,250640,prettiest one yes i agree that you have
_OFoyKXULN4,250640,253280,the most finished coated cake in
_OFoyKXULN4,253280,254879,michelle so who were the best two
_OFoyKXULN4,254879,257919,performers in this lesson best is david
_OFoyKXULN4,257919,259440,and
_OFoyKXULN4,259440,261919,michelle michelle you are currently in

_OFoyKXULN4,271919,273520,with that being said time for lesson
