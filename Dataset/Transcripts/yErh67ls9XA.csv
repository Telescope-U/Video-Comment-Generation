yErh67ls9XA,9760,16160,i put  every navy seal on the pedestal it's  easy to do it's easy to do  you read the books about them you see
yErh67ls9XA,16160,23119,movies about them super human  but what happens is once you drop
yErh67ls9XA,23119,28160,your own limitations and you so  one thing we do bad in life is we put
yErh67ls9XA,28160,33680,all these people above you  never put anybody above you man make it  an even playing field
yErh67ls9XA,33680,40239,but you can't make it even playing field  if you're not working your [ __ ] ass  off  i'm not saying not to respect people you
yErh67ls9XA,40239,46239,got to respect people  but if you're playing tennis right now  there's tennis going on here in queens  if you're playing tennis and you're
yErh67ls9XA,46239,53199,playing roger federer even roger  federer's not here right now let's say  you're playing  roger best ever arguably best ever
yErh67ls9XA,53199,59840,but i'm [ __ ] good at tennis but  roger's the best ever that's in my  [ __ ] head
yErh67ls9XA,59920,66479,and we're playing a five-set match grand  slam  before roger serves the ball the first
yErh67ls9XA,66479,71520,serve of the game  first serve set one game one
yErh67ls9XA,71520,77360,verse third in your mind  you're thinking man that's the best
yErh67ls9XA,77360,82560,[ __ ] person in the world to serve  this i thought about navy seals so what
yErh67ls9XA,82560,89200,happens is  two sets fly by roger [ __ ] smokes you  606.0
yErh67ls9XA,89200,96960,or 6061. you're like wow man  i can play with this [ __ ] but by
yErh67ls9XA,96960,104240,the time you realize you can play with  roger federer  it's too late it's too late so that's
yErh67ls9XA,104240,110159,what i mean by that  don't go into any competition of life  physical mental emotional
yErh67ls9XA,110159,115360,whatever it may be too late  you got to try so hard know know that
yErh67ls9XA,115360,123360,you worked hard  hard as [ __ ] to be on the even playing  field  so i did that so once i did that
yErh67ls9XA,123360,129360,your eyes opened up so i so now you  don't see roger federer as roger federer  seem as a [ __ ] tennis player so now
yErh67ls9XA,129360,135599,you're competing  on the first serve so give yourself a  chance to win
yErh67ls9XA,135599,143040,so when i went to navy seal training  after my first hell week second hell  week third hell week  i was like man
yErh67ls9XA,143040,149520,i can compete with these guys i only  compete with them  i'm gonna go another level because i
yErh67ls9XA,149520,154560,started seeing i put  these guys a lot of people on a pedestal
yErh67ls9XA,154560,160480,but it also hurt me it hurt me too  because when you put people on a
yErh67ls9XA,160480,166000,pedestal you expect  people to be at a certain level so i was
yErh67ls9XA,166000,171040,living off of wow  all these mythologies of what a special
yErh67ls9XA,171040,178400,forces guy is  you get up you don't sleep you run on  broken legs  you know i'm just like you know i really
yErh67ls9XA,178400,184400,fed into all that [ __ ] man  so it actually helped make me who i am  but i started looking around
yErh67ls9XA,184400,190400,seeing man these are really a lot of  normal [ __ ] guys  and that disappointed me but it
yErh67ls9XA,190400,196319,shouldn't have  my expectations were of myself
yErh67ls9XA,196319,202720,i was grouping everybody so that's why i  realized  being uncommon amongst uncommon it's
yErh67ls9XA,202720,209360,really about yourself  it's you against yourself it's not you  against them but it  kind of it sounds like that because
yErh67ls9XA,209360,215519,really these guys are uncommon  once you become a navy seal or whatever  you become a big ceo
yErh67ls9XA,215519,223120,you're now common again so everybody  looks at these guys as uncommon  but once you become one we're all guys
yErh67ls9XA,223120,230799,again  crawl in the same group of guys we're on  the same fraternity so how do you  separate yourself from the best
yErh67ls9XA,234080,241519,talk about the repetition in my book a  lot yeah gotta get the reps in  so now my conversation is this i never
yErh67ls9XA,241519,246799,set out to write a book when i was in  the dungeon and no one was coming back  to help me
yErh67ls9XA,246799,251840,i just wanted that reflection in that  accountability mirror that i hated so  badly
yErh67ls9XA,251840,257759,to be something that gave me pride to be  something that made me feel it wasn't  it's not about money it's not about
yErh67ls9XA,257759,263360,success it's not about people oh my god  that's david goggins  sign my book no when i started this
yErh67ls9XA,263360,270080,journey out  years ago it's about i just want to  learn to read  so now i'm at a place now where i see
yErh67ls9XA,270080,275120,the possibilities  of the human of human potential
yErh67ls9XA,275120,281440,what are we capable of is the  conversation now  the conversation now is how can i now
yErh67ls9XA,281440,287759,talk to people  in a way they can understand the message  that i have for so many people
yErh67ls9XA,287759,292880,so that's the that's the new  conversation now is that i you are  constantly evolving
yErh67ls9XA,292880,298240,you never say you're getting better  you're getting worse not staying the  same  so for me i have to constantly be
yErh67ls9XA,298240,304240,getting better i have to constantly be  evolving my message so  i'm constantly thinking in the quietness
yErh67ls9XA,304240,310320,of my mind that's that's the key point  too  the world is so fast-paced the world is  so noisy
yErh67ls9XA,310320,317039,so my conversation now a lot of times is  my god  slow down the world can take you
yErh67ls9XA,317039,323600,here here be here be there be everywhere  and i lose myself sometimes so i catch
yErh67ls9XA,323600,331759,myself  in the airport i catch myself in the  plane while writing stuff down okay  remember this remember that i'm going to  hey hey what got you here
yErh67ls9XA,331759,338880,this isn't what got you here slow the  [ __ ]  down go back to the quiet place of that
yErh67ls9XA,338880,346720,dirty mirror  in that seven dollar a month place you  used to live in  that's where you grew you so i so that's
yErh67ls9XA,346720,353199,what i'm constantly reminding myself and  go back to your roots  i'm not saying go back to hell i'm
yErh67ls9XA,353199,358639,saying don't forget where you come from  as you start to  explode out of the gate when you become
yErh67ls9XA,358639,366560,someone  my conversation is do not forget  your roots do not forget your roots
yErh67ls9XA,366560,372080,don't let this become so big that you  lose yourself  amongst the noise go back to the
yErh67ls9XA,372080,378840,quietness  of what made you successful that's the  conversation now it's a constant
yErh67ls9XA,378840,381840,reminder
yErh67ls9XA,389680,397520,that's where you find yourself you find  yourself you are  the you're not comfortable you're not
yErh67ls9XA,397520,403520,comfortable on a  daily basis and that's how i started to  grow  like i said about the mind it wants to
yErh67ls9XA,403520,409039,put you in that nice 72 degree  temperature  with everything right there it wants to
yErh67ls9XA,409039,414720,be in that knife with a little massage  therapist  that's where your mind wants to be it  doesn't want to be
yErh67ls9XA,414720,420639,you're going to talk about healthy so  the other one being healthy  and whole week i was in three of them i
yErh67ls9XA,420639,426479,finished two of them in one year  only person never do that is still  history there's been people who
yErh67ls9XA,426479,432880,have gone through a couple of hell weeks  but in like five years  six years seven years eight years i did
yErh67ls9XA,432880,438000,i was in three in one year  they say it takes off three to five  years of your life
yErh67ls9XA,438000,444800,so hell week is 130 hours of continuous  training  you might get two hours and what it does
yErh67ls9XA,444800,452479,is  it's designed to breaking  to breaking man down to the parts where
yErh67ls9XA,452479,458160,like i talk about the surface how it's  fixing the surface  if you only fix the surface you will
yErh67ls9XA,458160,464160,never get the help  because what it does it starts to bring  out these demons because even though  there's a lot of yelling
yErh67ls9XA,464160,470240,and stuff like that there's times where  it's very peaceful  in a very theory way so the first hour
yErh67ls9XA,470240,478319,of the 130  is breakout you're shooting done just  loud it's noisy your mind is  in chaos when your mind's in chaos
yErh67ls9XA,478319,484960,you can't think so you're having fun  yeah this is great yeah we're healthy  for navy seals or trying to be navy
yErh67ls9XA,484960,491280,seals or badasses  then what they do and i don't even think  that they understand what they're doing
yErh67ls9XA,491280,496479,but i studied the mind it's perfect  it's psychological warfare they go from
yErh67ls9XA,496479,503199,an hour the first  hour when you're going crazy the second  hour  of the 130 they put you in the cold
yErh67ls9XA,503199,508240,water  it's called surf torture now they don't  call it surf tours because it's a kind
yErh67ls9XA,508240,514320,of general word it's called  surf acclimation they put you out there  no one's quick there's only been an hour
yErh67ls9XA,514320,520080,maybe a couple of guys have and you're  in the pacific ocean which is never warm
yErh67ls9XA,520080,526480,you're all linked arms you're sitting  there and the waves are crashing over  you  i went through winter hill weeks which
yErh67ls9XA,526480,531600,is cold the pacific ocean is like 50  degrees  it was 49 this particular night in my
yErh67ls9XA,531600,536640,third hell week  and what it does is
yErh67ls9XA,536640,542080,it makes your mind flip out we've been  doing this now for three weeks being in  this water
yErh67ls9XA,542080,547120,but for some reason now the water is  colder than it's ever been it's not
yErh67ls9XA,547120,554560,our minds are fragile we can process  a day it's hard to process 130 hours
yErh67ls9XA,554560,559680,there's no end there's no end so the  mind starts to ramp up
yErh67ls9XA,559680,564160,so you're sitting there as quiet no  one's yelling at you hear the ocean
yErh67ls9XA,565040,574080,and you're freezing and your mind goes  [ __ ]  starts to think i'm another 129
yErh67ls9XA,574080,580640,hours if you're not going home you're  getting yelled at  you can be frozen so you panic you freak
yErh67ls9XA,580640,587519,out  and you want to quit what i realize  about the mind is those people who can  be in that time
yErh67ls9XA,587519,596320,and embrace that time and be in that  moment and not allow the mind  to go to 129 hours on hour one
yErh67ls9XA,596320,601760,it's the control that we don't have in  our minds it's a control that you had to  have for three months
yErh67ls9XA,601760,607279,when you're miserable when you're  suffering when you're laying on the  floor when you're doing all the  disciplines it takes to be a monk
yErh67ls9XA,607279,613760,you cannot think about the whole process  it will make you it will it will make
yErh67ls9XA,613760,620320,you so  insanely crazy it's impossible  it's inhumane what i'm about to do to
yErh67ls9XA,620320,625839,myself you have to be able to break  all these big humongous painful things  in life
yErh67ls9XA,625839,632480,down to the smallest molecule that's all  the brain can handle  the brain can't handle hours and hours
yErh67ls9XA,632480,637920,and hours of suffering  but it can handle right now i'm in the  pacific ocean
yErh67ls9XA,637920,643040,and it's very cold and this is what i'm  doing  don't think about the rest of it so
yErh67ls9XA,643040,648160,that's what i've learned from hell week  that's why i learned from being in three  health weeks
yErh67ls9XA,648160,655519,that's what i learned from all the  military i went to ranger school i went  to all these different schools  to learn all of that to learn
yErh67ls9XA,655519,661600,how the mind process so i talk about  theorists  i talk about practitioners a theorist is
yErh67ls9XA,661600,666880,a person who reads a book  doesn't do it reads a book learns about  something
yErh67ls9XA,666880,673519,and then talks about it a practitioner  is myself  a practitioner as a person like me i
yErh67ls9XA,673519,679680,wanted to be an expert in the mind  a mental toughness guy beyond mental  toughness the only way to do that in my
yErh67ls9XA,679680,685519,eyes  is to put yourself in hell put in help  repeatedly repeatedly put yourself in
yErh67ls9XA,685519,691440,hell and study how you  process it and that's how i was able to  come up with all these different ways
yErh67ls9XA,691440,698399,all these different tools to to slow the  mind down  in hell because the mind just speeds up
yErh67ls9XA,698399,704160,the mind wants to get out of the painful  situation the suffer  it can't it can't process it so that's
yErh67ls9XA,704160,710079,what i realized by going through all  these different processes of  being in hell weeks
yErh67ls9XA,712959,719519,there's some times where the mind gets  overwhelmed  and you cannot slow it down but by
yErh67ls9XA,719519,725440,these these certain tools are developed  by not allowing your mind to get away  from the moment
yErh67ls9XA,725440,732240,you cannot you have to think about the  exact moment that you're in  but i saw when i was younger the moment
yErh67ls9XA,732240,737440,became too big  when it became too big i spazzed out now  we quit
yErh67ls9XA,737440,744399,but now i don't think about even like an  hour from now i'll be eating  i don't even go there because in your
yErh67ls9XA,744399,751279,mind  oh no we must embrace this because now  there's you have to be a leader at this
yErh67ls9XA,751279,757040,moment it's not about you just getting  through it  i had six guys i had five guys and six
yErh67ls9XA,757040,763360,including me in my boat group  now as the bull crew leader so now  another trick is this
yErh67ls9XA,763360,769360,if you don't think about yourself  there's no pain  which can also lead to pain later on in
yErh67ls9XA,769360,774800,your life but in these moments when  you're struggling if you are a true  leader  and you're worried about your men or
yErh67ls9XA,774800,780800,women beside you  your mind doesn't care how cold you are  your mind's only worried about taking
yErh67ls9XA,780800,786399,care of the men and women beside you  so i started realizing man if i take  care of these cats when i left in my
yErh67ls9XA,786399,792320,right  in the worst moments my mind is no  longer thinking about  you're miserable david goggins get the
yErh67ls9XA,792320,799120,hell out of here think about  how is john how is andy how was sam how  was pete  hey how you guys doing you're not
yErh67ls9XA,799120,804800,thinking about me  so there's so many things you can do to  get outside your own head  because then a lot of your body just
yErh67ls9XA,804800,811519,feel like hey we're just machining  but you have to let your mind be able to  process all these different tactics
yErh67ls9XA,811519,818160,do that take a different vantage point  in life when you are in the hell  you can't see the beauty of being in it
yErh67ls9XA,818160,823519,when you're in it  get on top of that mountain top in your  mind just off that mountain and look
yErh67ls9XA,823519,829279,down at what you're doing  you can see a whole different world that  world is beautiful but you gotta get a
yErh67ls9XA,829279,836800,different  vantage point in this in the suck  don't be in it spiritually get out of it
yErh67ls9XA,836800,842800,get that soul look down on what you're  doing be amazed  by the process of where you're at now
yErh67ls9XA,842800,845680,and where you came from
yErh67ls9XA,849600,855680,and i looked at my [ __ ] was this is the  perfect training ground to being a man  you know a lot of people like i was
yErh67ls9XA,855680,862720,talking about taking the path of least  resistance  i believe in life you must earn
yErh67ls9XA,862720,868399,the right to be called a man and a lot  of people do not think the way i do and  that's fine
yErh67ls9XA,868399,875360,i'm not asking you to be david goggins  trust me it's a hard [ __ ] road to  home  it's not like it's not fun all the time
yErh67ls9XA,875360,880800,but the thing about it is  you have to look i i looked at my  hardships as challenges
yErh67ls9XA,880800,888639,once i got over the pity party because i  went through that face of course i'm a  normal human being  but i realized that that got me exactly
yErh67ls9XA,888639,894000,where i was at even worse  as i looked at those challenges the way  most people do
yErh67ls9XA,894000,900720,what was me why the [ __ ] can i get a  break  why i wish i was better i wish
yErh67ls9XA,900720,906880,my parents were better i always had a  better education i wish this i wish that  they have all these wish sandwiches i
yErh67ls9XA,906880,913440,started realizing  how can i [ __ ] figure out how this  [ __ ] can [ __ ] work for me
yErh67ls9XA,913440,919519,so the one thing we don't do is we don't  we're in that dark place  that dark place is a great learning
yErh67ls9XA,919519,924560,environment  if you can sit back in a dark place and  find quiet
yErh67ls9XA,924560,930240,to this think there's so much power  in your failures and your [ __ ] in
yErh67ls9XA,930240,935759,your suffering  because while you're still alive you're  still [ __ ] here
yErh67ls9XA,935759,941519,so you gotta look at that [ __ ] as my god  man this is power man like  now i gotta flip this [ __ ] how many men
yErh67ls9XA,941519,946880,will be able to do and i'm about to do  what i'm about to try to do like  literally what gave me strength was when
yErh67ls9XA,946880,954000,i was at the worst of my worst  how many men would even [ __ ] say they  want to try to be a negative right i'm  at the worst spot of my life
yErh67ls9XA,954000,960480,like i can't even walk down the street  let alone run down the street  and i'm gonna now call a recruiter up
yErh67ls9XA,960480,965920,and try to be a steal there's a lot of  power in that but people don't see it  there they see man that's stupid
yErh67ls9XA,965920,971519,i had this voice in the back of my head  that kept on running from  i was afraid the water i was afraid of
yErh67ls9XA,971519,976639,dealing with things  that made me feel unaccepted
yErh67ls9XA,976639,981680,i didn't accept myself so i kept on  going towards things that i felt good
yErh67ls9XA,981680,987440,let me let me go this way but something  kept on saying [ __ ] you  you have it man you got it man but
yErh67ls9XA,987440,993360,you're gonna have to fail  a lot but you have it and like i said  that voice kept on haunting but that
yErh67ls9XA,993360,1000160,voice kept on saying if you face it  you realize it's not that bad
yErh67ls9XA,1003440,1008560,i said i'm tired of feeling the way i  feel every day i'm tired of how i feel  tired of lying to myself lying to people
yErh67ls9XA,1008560,1015040,and just being some piece of [ __ ]  and i always knew in the back of my mind  i could be something special
yErh67ls9XA,1015040,1020240,but i knew the work it was going to take  was going to kill me
yErh67ls9XA,1020240,1026720,i was afraid of that i was afraid of the  brutality  and the suffering i was going to have to
yErh67ls9XA,1026720,1032880,endure  but i knew i knew i could do something  but i'm like i ain't trying to do that
yErh67ls9XA,1032880,1038400,kind of work man what got me to this  point was i was just the opposite of  what i am today
yErh67ls9XA,1038400,1044558,i was that guy who ran away from  absolutely  everything that i got in front of me but
yErh67ls9XA,1044558,1050000,not many people knew that  like the real me was like this very  scared insecure
yErh67ls9XA,1050000,1055200,stuttering got beat up by his dad all  this kind of stuff
yErh67ls9XA,1055360,1061679,first of all you have to start your  journey and many of us think because  we're born  into this world that we have started our
yErh67ls9XA,1061679,1067679,journey that's not it man  that's not it it's not that simple i  wish it was that simple
yErh67ls9XA,1067679,1074880,many people have died and lived to be  100 [ __ ] years old  and never started their journey that
yErh67ls9XA,1074880,1080000,journey starts when you start to meet  yourself  at that battle you start to battle
yErh67ls9XA,1080000,1085760,yourself  and start to break down those walls that  you  and society start to build in your own
yErh67ls9XA,1085760,1094640,mind once you start to break down those  walls you've now started your journey  your journey has to be hard at first
yErh67ls9XA,1094640,1102320,i couldn't run the first thing about it  was so i said to myself i'm gonna run  four miles  my first run off the gate i'm gonna run
yErh67ls9XA,1102320,1108559,four miles  i ran a mile i went a quarter of a mile  walked home sat on the couch depressed
yErh67ls9XA,1108559,1114080,i said man there's no way i can do this  but what i realized though  is i wasn't going to give up because i
yErh67ls9XA,1114080,1119520,already given up a million times  and i thought about how would i feel at  50 years old
yErh67ls9XA,1119520,1125039,if i gave up now not to have you know so  i kept all this stuff in my mind
yErh67ls9XA,1125039,1130799,basically i started becoming obsessed  i slowly it didn't happen that night on
yErh67ls9XA,1130799,1136000,the couch  over a period of time i started becoming  obsessed with
yErh67ls9XA,1136000,1141679,studying with weight with being somebody  was making people who thought it was  gonna be nothing
yErh67ls9XA,1141679,1147440,kind of like feel like [ __ ] i became  obsessed with  you have to make this right and the only
yErh67ls9XA,1147440,1154240,person could do is yourself  so i became obsessed with just being  obsessed
yErh67ls9XA,1156240,1162000,the reason why we go back to old habits  is because our goals are too lofty  we're not achieving our goals fast
yErh67ls9XA,1162000,1170000,enough so what happens is you know what  ah man  we're very impatient nowadays for me
yErh67ls9XA,1170000,1176400,it was good i have a phone i was i was  i was out of this world by myself
yErh67ls9XA,1176400,1183039,it was a race against david goggins they  want to race against  god i don't look good for this person or  that person it was me
yErh67ls9XA,1183039,1188240,i got to change myself so for me if i  lost five pounds in a week
yErh67ls9XA,1188240,1196080,i got a feeling i allowed myself to feel  proud of that  i didn't look i gotta lose 106 pounds
yErh67ls9XA,1196080,1202480,i'm like man i went from 297.  now i'm 292. in one week man i'm
yErh67ls9XA,1202480,1209520,i'm killing it we don't we're not proud  of ourselves  for the small accomplishments what we
yErh67ls9XA,1209520,1217440,need  is we need this monstrosity of the thing  to happen say  ah did it nah there's a process that you
yErh67ls9XA,1217440,1224880,have to go through and patience  is the process and if we don't have  patience  after a week i haven't lost 30 pounds
yErh67ls9XA,1224880,1230000,and i'm done  i'm over it so that's why i found out  with people man they're not patient  enough to realize and to
yErh67ls9XA,1230000,1236000,enjoy the moment not living it just  enjoy it  there's no finish line in life but enjoy
yErh67ls9XA,1236000,1241520,that moment  roger that man i lost five let me go 10  next week  so that's the whole thing about it
yErh67ls9XA,1241520,1244880,that's how people lose it
yErh67ls9XA,1246559,1254000,it starts with yourself man you got to  start diving into those things that you  are afraid of  you don't gain confidence by going to
yErh67ls9XA,1254000,1259039,the spot that makes you feel good  it could be a false reality and the
yErh67ls9XA,1259039,1264559,second life gives you that challenge  all you want to do is go back to what  made you confidence
yErh67ls9XA,1264559,1271280,or or or what gave you confidence is  that happy spot  no what gives you confidence what gave
yErh67ls9XA,1271280,1278720,me confidence  was spending years at a kitchen table  trying to learn how to read and write on
yErh67ls9XA,1278720,1284159,my own  realizing i can't learn the way you  learn i can't
yErh67ls9XA,1284159,1291760,but i can learn what gives you  confidence not being  afraid it's overcoming the fear
yErh67ls9XA,1291760,1297039,isis stutters severely bad so right now  i don't know how many people are going  to watch this  you know what gives me confidence is
yErh67ls9XA,1297039,1303039,knowing i no longer care  if i sit and start stuttering to you  yeah that's what gives me confidence
yErh67ls9XA,1303039,1309679,is facing these things overcoming them  and maybe not overcoming them every day  but facing them and facing their face
yErh67ls9XA,1309679,1315600,and preaching like this you know what  man this is where it's at  it's not in that comfort zone it's in
yErh67ls9XA,1315600,1321840,the discomfort zone  is where my confidence is getting built  that's where it's getting built
yErh67ls9XA,1321840,1327360,but people want to they want an easier  answer  there has to be an easier way there's
yErh67ls9XA,1327360,1334559,not i'm sorry  i searched for it my entire life you  changed  your life i lied i did everything and i
yErh67ls9XA,1334559,1340400,still felt empty  i coach a lot of people nowadays  billionaires
yErh67ls9XA,1340400,1346880,who call me on the phone and say man i'm  still missing something  it's because they did what they were
yErh67ls9XA,1346880,1352400,good at  and they had this beautiful family two
yErh67ls9XA,1352400,1357520,three houses cars everything  has everything in the world on the  outside looking like my god man how can
yErh67ls9XA,1357520,1362880,you be unhappy  i walk around with the backpack with all  my stuff in here no car
yErh67ls9XA,1362880,1370400,right and i walk around happiest person  in the world  have nothing happy as hell it's because
yErh67ls9XA,1370400,1377440,i found out the whole key to life it's  not in all that  you have to face yourself so many people
yErh67ls9XA,1377440,1383360,live to be 100 years old  and they die miserable having everything  because they never
yErh67ls9XA,1383360,1390240,examined i call it my live autopsy  you never examine this
yErh67ls9XA,1390240,1396799,happiness peace enlightenment  it's all up here man it's all up here
yErh67ls9XA,1396799,1402320,if i start talking like this people are  man you know no  no it's the truth man yeah it's true
yErh67ls9XA,1402320,1408640,it's all up here  he's gotta be willing to go and face it  and that's the hard part
yErh67ls9XA,1411360,1416960,um i saw a rocky train in the movie  but i see what i went through in real
yErh67ls9XA,1416960,1423840,life  that that movie is a fraction that  all those movies i watched that inspired
yErh67ls9XA,1423840,1431679,me they're all fractions of  the real work i put into my life and i  don't ever talk about enough
yErh67ls9XA,1431679,1437039,the amount of work i put into being who  i am  i don't have enough time in the [ __ ]
yErh67ls9XA,1437039,1442720,day like  i don't talk about it i don't i don't  brag about it
yErh67ls9XA,1442720,1449039,no one even knows about it like 99.9  of the [ __ ] i did to get to where i'm at
yErh67ls9XA,1449039,1454080,today  was alone alone
yErh67ls9XA,1454080,1461200,out there running and cold and heat  suffering in pools trying to swim  at home in a [ __ ] room by myself
yErh67ls9XA,1461200,1466400,trying to teach myself how to read and  write how to study  you know no one saw that [ __ ] there was
yErh67ls9XA,1466400,1472159,no video okay there was no podcast  there's no  who's david goggins it was me i just  just
yErh67ls9XA,1472159,1479120,for me trying to get in the military  was everybody can do it's easy
yErh67ls9XA,1479120,1484320,just trying to learn how to read and  write was something that blows rocky  away
yErh67ls9XA,1484320,1491360,so all these different challenges that  i've been through my life  i've i've easily you know i don't i
yErh67ls9XA,1491360,1497120,don't look at that movie the same way  because i'm i'm proud of what i created  but i'm more proud
yErh67ls9XA,1497120,1503039,i've created it without an audience  without a cheering squad without someone
yErh67ls9XA,1503039,1509440,like  you know like you run the boston  marathon and people love that race they  run so fast because for 26.2 miles
yErh67ls9XA,1509440,1516000,there's a motherfuckingness come on man  you got it  you can do it you know who you are
yErh67ls9XA,1516000,1522880,when there's no [ __ ] out there  when you're running  and you're at mile 75 150 mile race
yErh67ls9XA,1522880,1529520,ain't nobody cheering for you you're  broken you're [ __ ] defeated it's you  and you alone in your [ __ ] head and i
yErh67ls9XA,1529520,1535440,stayed that way for the better part of  30 [ __ ] years
yErh67ls9XA,1535440,1541520,trying to figure this [ __ ] out and once  you figure it out  you look at your everybody hey so you're
yErh67ls9XA,1541520,1546559,all broken now  you know is that how you want to be
yErh67ls9XA,1546559,1553520,yep if you could feel if i could put my  brain in your [ __ ] head  you said the same [ __ ] thing you
yErh67ls9XA,1553520,1559200,would no longer think i was [ __ ]  crazy you know what i think i was  sadistic  you realize [ __ ] this guy found
yErh67ls9XA,1559200,1565200,it  there has to be something so deep in you
yErh67ls9XA,1565200,1573120,that drives you so  what really does it for me is i know  what we're  capable of and i know that
yErh67ls9XA,1573120,1579840,most human beings aren't willing to go  where i am and that's a very very
yErh67ls9XA,1579840,1586080,dangerous thing i'm not saying i'm  bearing anybody else everybody has this  talent it's not a talent  it's just realizing that we stop way
yErh67ls9XA,1586080,1591840,short of our true potential  so through my life i realize these  things
yErh67ls9XA,1591840,1598159,and i know what gives me feeling as i  know that most people who are  blessed with so much talent great
yErh67ls9XA,1598159,1603919,parents great upbringing didn't it count  where i come from  they're going to equip it for me having
yErh67ls9XA,1603919,1609520,all the tools that they have  they didn't have the ability to examine  themselves
yErh67ls9XA,1609520,1615600,when you have everything so nice in life  it's great to have a great life but what  happens is you don't
yErh67ls9XA,1615600,1623200,self examine you don't do a live autopsy  when you have a [ __ ] up life it almost
yErh67ls9XA,1623200,1629200,forces you to do a live autopsy it  forces you to find strength from places  that no one looks from
yErh67ls9XA,1629200,1634640,because food is not at the ready you  know  you're me i have a learning disability
yErh67ls9XA,1634640,1641360,it's not at the ready i can't just pick  up a book and start reading right  right there's preparation behind  everything i [ __ ] do
yErh67ls9XA,1641360,1647200,there's there's everything i do has to  come with so much [ __ ] preparation  it's  despicable it makes me sick my own
yErh67ls9XA,1647200,1652399,personal life makes me sick that's why  i'm so disciplined now  without my self-discipline there is no
yErh67ls9XA,1652399,1659440,david goggins  like i can't like stop reading i won't  be able to read tomorrow
yErh67ls9XA,1659440,1665919,it will i will lose it that fast you  know i  you know i cannot stop going to the gym
yErh67ls9XA,1665919,1672640,my mind is set up in a spot where hey  the second i stop  it wants to stop because i had a
yErh67ls9XA,1672640,1677760,quitting mind  growing up when you get beat the [ __ ]  out of you all the time your mind
yErh67ls9XA,1677760,1682960,wants to go to that nice spot where  you're comforted  where you're not trying where [ __ ] is
yErh67ls9XA,1682960,1688080,easy that's where your mind  it doesn't want to think you have all  these things in the mind and the mind
yErh67ls9XA,1688080,1693840,can only absorb so much [ __ ]  so all the pain that has to go through  it doesn't it wants to push it away it
yErh67ls9XA,1693840,1699600,says let's not do that  so every day i'm fighting where the mind  wants to go
yErh67ls9XA,1699600,1705200,so it's a it's a it's a constant it's a  constant evolution man
yErh67ls9XA,1708000,1715360,spirit life is that there is a final  resting place in this world  and there's a final judgment and you
yErh67ls9XA,1715360,1721679,talk to something  much bigger than you i don't want to sit  down have a conversation with someone
yErh67ls9XA,1721679,1728880,with something that says you're in  heaven  this is what you should have been on  earth and
yErh67ls9XA,1728880,1735279,are you really in heaven now are you in  hell thinking about how much i left on a  table for fear
yErh67ls9XA,1735279,1742960,for not willing to go over the wall and  over the next wall and over the next  wall  so my mind i believe that and god knows
yErh67ls9XA,1742960,1748080,all  at least i believe that i want
yErh67ls9XA,1748080,1754000,god to be up there right now as we're  speaking writing stuff down  saying my god he exceeded even my
yErh67ls9XA,1754000,1761200,expectations  that's how i lived my life i now know  that there is no cap
yErh67ls9XA,1761200,1767840,on the human mind there's no cap  we cap it ourselves
yErh67ls9XA,1770480,1776000,some of us are going through [ __ ]  hell maybe not as bad as me maybe worse  than me  sure but they don't know how to express
yErh67ls9XA,1776000,1781279,it because we're supposed to live in the  [ __ ] world  where we have to talk a certain way we
yErh67ls9XA,1781279,1786559,have to walk a certain way we have to  act a certain way  a kind of gentler world nothing gets
yErh67ls9XA,1786559,1792080,handled in that [ __ ] world  you stay [ __ ] up in that world
yErh67ls9XA,1792080,1797440,you stay in a world of things would get  better because someone said they would
yErh67ls9XA,1797440,1802480,and i need to find peace no  you need to go to [ __ ] war with
yErh67ls9XA,1802480,1808960,yourself man  at the end of that [ __ ] war you'll  sit back all damaged and bruised and
yErh67ls9XA,1808960,1814399,scarred up and [ __ ] up  and maybe your psoas muscles so tight  that you may lose two inches on your
yErh67ls9XA,1814399,1819520,[ __ ] body  who knows but then that [ __ ] war  you're gonna sit back on the couch
yErh67ls9XA,1819520,1825360,maybe have a [ __ ] glass of water if  you drink a beer you drink a beer  the war may be 30 [ __ ] years but when
yErh67ls9XA,1825360,1830960,it ends  you will know what the [ __ ] is all about  then and then you'll find your [ __ ]  peace
yErh67ls9XA,1830960,1836960,you'll find your [ __ ] piece then but  until then you'll always be searching to  find that nice kind book
yErh67ls9XA,1836960,1844080,that guides you beyond all your personal  suffering and [ __ ]  that miracle is your [ __ ] after piece
yErh67ls9XA,1844080,1850559,it doesn't happen man maybe it does for  some people but you're just scratching  the surface of real life
