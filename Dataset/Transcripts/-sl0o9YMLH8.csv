-sl0o9YMLH8,30,4390,apple is releasing the m2 macbook pro early and by the time you're watching
-sl0o9YMLH8,4390,8690,this video you could probably order it or you're just a few hours away instead
-sl0o9YMLH8,8690,13070,of having to wait for next month like they told us just a week ago so with
-sl0o9YMLH8,13070,17970,that many of you guys are asking is it really worth buying the m2 macbook pro
-sl0o9YMLH8,17970,22919,or should you spend a bit more money and buy the 14 inch m1 pro macbook pro
-sl0o9YMLH8,22920,27640,instead well today i'm gonna answer exactly that and yes depending on what
-sl0o9YMLH8,27640,33420,you do for some the m2 macbook pro even the base model will outperform the 14
-sl0o9YMLH8,33420,37530,inch for less money and because of what apple did with the m2 macbook pro and
-sl0o9YMLH8,37530,41930,the newly released benchmarks that we have we know almost everything about it
-sl0o9YMLH8,41930,46600,so this will be the most detailed feature and quality comparison anywhere
-sl0o9YMLH8,46600,51460,on the internet to help you decide which one to buy until of course we get our m2
-sl0o9YMLH8,51460,55710,models from apple and dive even deeper with a ton of productivity tasks and
-sl0o9YMLH8,55710,59859,special tests that most people don't want to spend time on so make sure to
-sl0o9YMLH8,59859,63289,click that subscribe button down below to check out that video but this one
-sl0o9YMLH8,63289,66670,will help all of you guys who are trying to decide which one they should order
-sl0o9YMLH8,66670,72240,right now the 13 inch m2 macbook pro looks identical to the m1 macbook pro
-sl0o9YMLH8,72240,76460,heck it's pretty much identical to the same one that came out in 2016.
-sl0o9YMLH8,76460,80340,apple decided to take the easy and more profitable route and keep everything the
-sl0o9YMLH8,80340,85590,same other than a few software tricks and replacing the m1 chip with m2 and
-sl0o9YMLH8,85590,89469,that not only frustrated many people leading them to want to buy either the
-sl0o9YMLH8,89470,94030,redesigned macbook air or the 14 inch macbook pro but that also gives me a bit
-sl0o9YMLH8,94030,98130,of concern about how the small single fan will handle the now confirmed higher
-sl0o9YMLH8,98130,103259,clock speeds and more graphics course of the m2 chip the 14 inch pro has the new
-sl0o9YMLH8,103260,108280,design that launched last fall with a boxier slate type look that replaced the
-sl0o9YMLH8,108280,112810,previous high-end 13-inch now in some ways it actually looks older and way
-sl0o9YMLH8,112810,117679,bigger but the 14 inch is actually slightly thinner than the 13 it just
-sl0o9YMLH8,117679,122439,doesn't look that way because of all the tapered sides but with that it is also
-sl0o9YMLH8,122439,127380,half a pound heavier that boxy design allows not only for a larger internal
-sl0o9YMLH8,127380,131480,battery which will talk about real world battery life in just a bit but also for
-sl0o9YMLH8,131480,136060,a much better cooling system as well the intake slots are much larger and on the
-sl0o9YMLH8,136060,140680,back almost the whole section below the hinge is for a hot air exhaust instead
-sl0o9YMLH8,140680,145560,of just two parts on the m2 13 inch macbook with that the m2s exhaust are
-sl0o9YMLH8,145560,149510,partially blocked when the screen is open whereas the new 14 inch has a
-sl0o9YMLH8,149510,153510,convertible design where the airflow doesn't get blocked but instead it's
-sl0o9YMLH8,153510,157959,rerouted and can flow up in front of the screen so no matter what even if your
-sl0o9YMLH8,157960,161959,laptop is on a blanket there are no issues with cooling and thanks to the
-sl0o9YMLH8,161959,166209,newly released benchmark tests we know that the m2 chip also uses more power
-sl0o9YMLH8,166209,170940,for both the gpu and the cpu and that the previous m1 would sometimes throttle
-sl0o9YMLH8,170940,175870,in the macbook pro running on that single fan loudly so we'll see how it
-sl0o9YMLH8,175870,181090,handles the m2 whereas the 2 000 14 inch stayed silent pretty much all the time
-sl0o9YMLH8,181090,186650,even under heavy loads because of its larger and dual fans along with the
-sl0o9YMLH8,186650,191060,better airflow design so if having a cool and quiet system matters for you
-sl0o9YMLH8,191060,195489,keep that in mind the same thing goes for speakers the 13 inch uses the same
-sl0o9YMLH8,195489,200689,ones from 2016 whereas the 14 has six speakers with dual force canceling
-sl0o9YMLH8,200689,204510,woofers that sound much much better here take a listen for yourself
-sl0o9YMLH8,204510,217760,[Music] [Music]
-sl0o9YMLH8,217760,231019,[Music] [Music]
-sl0o9YMLH8,231020,235319,now even though we have a 900 microphone setup the difference in real life is
-sl0o9YMLH8,235319,240230,even greater so if you care about having great speakers the 14 inch is the way to
-sl0o9YMLH8,240230,244980,go now with that there is a massive difference in webcam quality and not
-sl0o9YMLH8,244980,250049,only sharpness since the 14 inch uses a 1080p webcam instead of 720p in the 13
-sl0o9YMLH8,250049,254360,inch but the exposure and colors are way better and then low light performance is
-sl0o9YMLH8,254360,260000,just incomparable i would just say apple should have put a 1080p webcam in the m2
-sl0o9YMLH8,260000,264050,macbook pro getting back to the design the 13-inch m2 macro pro gives you two
-sl0o9YMLH8,264050,268860,thunderbolt 3 ports one of which is used for charging as well as a headphone jack
-sl0o9YMLH8,268860,272830,with the 14 inch apple gave its users what they have been asking for for years
-sl0o9YMLH8,272830,276888,now and we have of course the same headphone jack along with a dedicated
-sl0o9YMLH8,276889,282889,hdmi port and an sd card reader then we have three thunderbolt 4 ports and a
-sl0o9YMLH8,282889,287430,dedicated magnetic magsafe charging port which of course is convenient and it can
-sl0o9YMLH8,287430,291410,prevent damage this means that if you're charging and transferring files from a
-sl0o9YMLH8,291410,295870,sd card reader or you're connected with an hdmi adapter cable you are out of
-sl0o9YMLH8,295870,300169,ports on the 13-inch whereas the 14-inch you still have three full-speed
-sl0o9YMLH8,300170,305150,thunderbolt ports available now yes you can buy a dock or a cheaper dongle for
-sl0o9YMLH8,305150,309139,the 13-inch macbook pro and we covered our favorite budget options in my
-sl0o9YMLH8,309139,312390,must-have macbook accessories video which i'll link to down in the
-sl0o9YMLH8,312390,318110,description but it is nice to not need any dongles or adapters and even if you
-sl0o9YMLH8,318110,322300,do buy one you'll still be limited to only one external display at full
-sl0o9YMLH8,322300,327610,quality with the inch instead of three with the 14 inch macbook pro now there
-sl0o9YMLH8,327610,331638,are some workarounds and there's some expensive adapters like this anchor one
-sl0o9YMLH8,331639,335550,that can work but you will spend a lot of money and compromising display
-sl0o9YMLH8,335550,340819,quality either way the 14 inch can also fast charge to 50 in 30 minutes over
-sl0o9YMLH8,340820,346169,magsafe or usb type c if you have a power source that is over 94 watts which
-sl0o9YMLH8,346169,350410,could be a usb type-c display or my favorite power bank which i'll link down
-sl0o9YMLH8,350410,354389,in description below along with the 96 watt adapter that comes with the higher
-sl0o9YMLH8,354389,360199,spec models or is a 20 upgrade for the base spec the 13 inch macbook pro will
-sl0o9YMLH8,360199,365020,take over an hour to reach 50 no matter what you have it connected to
-sl0o9YMLH8,365020,370210,now as far as how long they last the 13 inch is ahead due to its four efficiency
-sl0o9YMLH8,370210,375080,cores instead of two and the smaller and much worse quality screen for video
-sl0o9YMLH8,375080,380090,playback you get 20 hours compared to 17 which isn't that big of a difference but
-sl0o9YMLH8,380090,385419,for web usage you get 17 hours compared to 11 which does make a real world
-sl0o9YMLH8,385419,390310,difference of course this is from apple using low brightness and very easy tests
-sl0o9YMLH8,390310,395050,that rely on the media engines and the efficiency cores now in our extensive
-sl0o9YMLH8,395050,398728,testing we found that the m113 inch macbook pro lasted three hours longer
-sl0o9YMLH8,398729,404190,than the 14 inch in mixed real world usage and since the m2 uses about 10
-sl0o9YMLH8,404190,408990,more power for the cpu and 25 more power for the graphics the real world battery
-sl0o9YMLH8,408990,413888,life will drop but will still be about one to two hours ahead of the 14-inch
-sl0o9YMLH8,413889,418789,now another reason the 14-inch uses more power is that larger notch display with
-sl0o9YMLH8,418789,424479,much slimmer bezels and with the much smoother 120 hertz pro motion instead of
-sl0o9YMLH8,424479,429930,60 hertz now not only does it support a billion colors compared to 16 million on
-sl0o9YMLH8,429930,434819,the 13 inch pro it also uses mini led technology that lets it reach an insane
-sl0o9YMLH8,434819,440849,1600 nits of peak brightness and a crazy high 1000 nit full screen sustained
-sl0o9YMLH8,440849,446210,compared to 500 on the 13 inch pro now because of this we get super deep blacks
-sl0o9YMLH8,446210,450530,and very bright highlights so hdr movie watching is amazing
-sl0o9YMLH8,450530,454150,and if you want to work with hdr video or images you have to get the 14 inch
-sl0o9YMLH8,454150,458669,macbook pro the one downside is under the most tough conditions you might see
-sl0o9YMLH8,458669,463750,some glow around small black bright objects on pure black backgrounds but
-sl0o9YMLH8,463750,468099,this is very rare and in the same situation the 13 inch macros blacks
-sl0o9YMLH8,468099,473270,would be great anyways and now on to performance starting with the ssd speed
-sl0o9YMLH8,473270,478160,the 14 inch write speed is more than twice as fast and the read is close to
-sl0o9YMLH8,478160,482260,twice as fast so you're getting much better ssds and as far as cpu and
-sl0o9YMLH8,482260,486330,graphics performance we've already gotten many results uploaded online and
-sl0o9YMLH8,486330,490430,we know that apple raised the power usage and the clock speeds which allows
-sl0o9YMLH8,490430,495000,them to hit 1919 points for geekbench single core
-sl0o9YMLH8,495000,500290,which is the fastest on any laptop about nine percent faster than the m1 pro for
-sl0o9YMLH8,500290,504729,multi-core m2 has a nice boost up to 8928
-sl0o9YMLH8,504729,510550,still slower than the 9884 and the base m1 pro but it is now only 10 behind
-sl0o9YMLH8,510550,516060,whereas the m1 pro used to be 32 faster than m1 in terms of graphics these two
-sl0o9YMLH8,516060,520140,extra cores really help and even though the 14 core m1 pro is still more
-sl0o9YMLH8,520140,526120,powerful than the 10 core m2 if we do the math apple is getting 2 983 points
-sl0o9YMLH8,526120,532230,out of each core compared to 2530 with the m1 pro proving the apple
-sl0o9YMLH8,532230,536430,is pushing more wattage to each core which once again has me wondering about
-sl0o9YMLH8,536430,541330,heat and fan noise now as far as the media engines this is one area where the
-sl0o9YMLH8,541330,546030,m2 is better the m1 did not support prores hardware decoding and encoding
-sl0o9YMLH8,546030,551450,which only came with m1 pro and above but apple surprisingly added that to the
-sl0o9YMLH8,551450,557110,m2 chip so a 1300 macbook pro will edit prores better than most high-end windows
-sl0o9YMLH8,557110,563910,pcs but with that m2 has even faster h.264 and h.265 hardware which now
-sl0o9YMLH8,563910,568649,supports ak where m1 pro does not meaning that ak
-sl0o9YMLH8,568650,572650,videos will export faster with the m2 as long as your graphics don't bottleneck
-sl0o9YMLH8,572650,577340,you and even if they do the m2 might still be faster than the 14 core version
-sl0o9YMLH8,577340,582420,of the m1 pro doing the math that means that the m2 can export 4k video at 120
-sl0o9YMLH8,582420,586880,frames per second now whereas the m1 pro and the 14 inch only does this at 90
-sl0o9YMLH8,586880,591010,just like that one meaning for those of you guys that work with standard 4k
-sl0o9YMLH8,591010,595140,video without a crazy amount of effects which is most people on youtube the 13
-sl0o9YMLH8,595140,600100,inch m2 macbook pro will actually edit video faster if both have 16 gigs of ram
-sl0o9YMLH8,600100,603980,now of course if you spend even more money you can upgrade the processors and
-sl0o9YMLH8,603980,607579,the graphics in the 14 inch but most people that are thinking of stretching
-sl0o9YMLH8,607580,613200,their budget to buy a 14 inch instead of a 13 won't be just tacking on a ton of
-sl0o9YMLH8,613200,617750,extra money on top of that as far as photo editing we don't know exactly how
-sl0o9YMLH8,617750,621930,fast it will be but based on our previous testing and how much faster the
-sl0o9YMLH8,621930,626580,m2 is as well as the higher memory speed and bandwidth i would estimate it to be
-sl0o9YMLH8,626580,631330,about two minutes or maybe slightly under that for our standard photo test
-sl0o9YMLH8,631330,635820,so close to the m1 pro but not beating it out if both machines have the same
-sl0o9YMLH8,635820,640440,amount of ram now of course the m2 allows you to get up to 24 gigs of ram
-sl0o9YMLH8,640440,645540,for 200 more than the 16 gigabyte option whereas the 14 inch requires you to get
-sl0o9YMLH8,645540,652399,32 gigs for a 400 bump but i think that if you're spending that much money on uh
-sl0o9YMLH8,652400,657770,for a 13 inch macbook pro to get you up to 24 gigs it's not really worth it you
-sl0o9YMLH8,657770,662040,might as well go for the 14 inch so overall even if you upgrade the m2 and
-sl0o9YMLH8,662040,666199,you get it close to the price of the 14 inch the 14 inch is still faster in most
-sl0o9YMLH8,666200,670530,ways now if you're getting the base model m2 macbook pro that's a 700
-sl0o9YMLH8,670530,674450,upgrade unless you know that you need something specifically from the 14 inch
-sl0o9YMLH8,674450,679160,i would not do it but instead i would take a look at the m2 macbook air that
-sl0o9YMLH8,679160,683009,you can actually get for less money i think that is also a better machine and
-sl0o9YMLH8,683010,687800,we actually have a detailed comparison against that as well which you can check
