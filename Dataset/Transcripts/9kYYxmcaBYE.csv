9kYYxmcaBYE,9660,13789,[Music]
9kYYxmcaBYE,14160,17200,i'm jacob and we're going for a drive
9kYYxmcaBYE,17200,27230,[Music]
9kYYxmcaBYE,28880,32800,2022 porsche tycoon gts sport turismo
9kYYxmcaBYE,32800,35600,with launch control
9kYYxmcaBYE,40559,42320,jeez that's fast those sounds are pretty
9kYYxmcaBYE,42320,43680,interesting yeah they're definitely
9kYYxmcaBYE,43680,44800,different like they said they were for
9kYYxmcaBYE,44800,45440,this
9kYYxmcaBYE,45440,49039,[Music]
9kYYxmcaBYE,49039,53280,horsepower and torque 509 horsepower 627
9kYYxmcaBYE,53280,54800,pound-feet of torque from two electric
9kYYxmcaBYE,54800,57199,motors and a 93 kilowatt hour battery
9kYYxmcaBYE,57199,59680,however has 590 horsepower during over
9kYYxmcaBYE,59680,62480,boost launch control mode heck yeah yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,62480,63840,so it sounds kind of the same when
9kYYxmcaBYE,63840,65360,you're driving but during that launch it
9kYYxmcaBYE,65360,67200,sounded different like
9kYYxmcaBYE,67200,69040,that sounds like every other tycon they
9kYYxmcaBYE,69040,71200,added a little bit of tang to it only
9kYYxmcaBYE,71200,73040,during the overboost launch but it
9kYYxmcaBYE,73040,74400,sounds good it feels pretty good
9kYYxmcaBYE,74400,75840,definitely not as fast as a turbo but
9kYYxmcaBYE,75840,78799,definitely much faster than a non-turbo
9kYYxmcaBYE,78799,81759,and gts's are always the sweet spot yuri
9kYYxmcaBYE,81759,84000,and uh this is actually the sweet spot
9kYYxmcaBYE,84000,86479,once again they did it again
9kYYxmcaBYE,86479,88320,let's test it into cliche corner so
9kYYxmcaBYE,88320,91360,handling i already know it's it's really
9kYYxmcaBYE,91360,93119,really good tycons are already really
9kYYxmcaBYE,93119,95280,good they kind of all feel the same but
9kYYxmcaBYE,95280,96720,this one feels the same in a very good
9kYYxmcaBYE,96720,98560,way like it has rear axle steering and
9kYYxmcaBYE,98560,99200,it
9kYYxmcaBYE,99200,100960,rips really hard and it kind of wants to
9kYYxmcaBYE,100960,102159,let the back end out a little bit it
9kYYxmcaBYE,102159,104399,feels less like every electric car that
9kYYxmcaBYE,104399,106399,just like rockets you out yes and it
9kYYxmcaBYE,106399,108399,feels more like you have some flow to it
9kYYxmcaBYE,108399,109759,and i guess that was the whole point of
9kYYxmcaBYE,109759,112880,gts yeah i love how this drives unless
9kYYxmcaBYE,112880,114960,you watch the actual gts commercial in
9kYYxmcaBYE,114960,116640,which case it makes no sense what
9kYYxmcaBYE,116640,117759,they're trying to show it's like a
9kYYxmcaBYE,117759,119520,swimmer and like people putting the
9kYYxmcaBYE,119520,121600,swimmer down and the swimmer canceling
9kYYxmcaBYE,121600,123360,plans and that is just like a weird
9kYYxmcaBYE,123360,125680,stuff that seems like it's kind of most
9kYYxmcaBYE,125680,127119,modern commercials for cars like that
9kYYxmcaBYE,127119,129200,make no sense no no it's like a it's
9kYYxmcaBYE,129200,130959,like that johnny depp dr commercial
9kYYxmcaBYE,130959,132080,where he's like playing guitar in the
9kYYxmcaBYE,132080,134319,desert like what what is this uh also so
9kYYxmcaBYE,134319,135760,i'm in sport plus i did that senate
9kYYxmcaBYE,135760,137840,sport plus it's really hot out today and
9kYYxmcaBYE,137840,140000,it said my ac has been deactivated so
9kYYxmcaBYE,140000,141360,i'm going to go back into sport and
9kYYxmcaBYE,141360,143280,hopefully the ac comes back on yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,143280,145280,please please cause uh it's it still
9kYYxmcaBYE,145280,146400,hasn't come back on i'm going to go
9kYYxmcaBYE,146400,148239,there it's there it's there okay let's
9kYYxmcaBYE,148239,150239,go to sport and the reason that this
9kYYxmcaBYE,150239,151920,probably handles really really well is
9kYYxmcaBYE,151920,153760,that it's really low to the ground so
9kYYxmcaBYE,153760,155840,this is the sport turismo we previously
9kYYxmcaBYE,155840,158480,drove the cross turismo turbo and turbo
9kYYxmcaBYE,158480,161040,s and this is the first sport turismo
9kYYxmcaBYE,161040,162160,ticon
9kYYxmcaBYE,162160,164160,because crosstarismo means it's lifted
9kYYxmcaBYE,164160,166080,and has the cladding exactly so it's a
9kYYxmcaBYE,166080,168000,sport turismo because there's no plastic
9kYYxmcaBYE,168000,169680,cladding so it looks really good and
9kYYxmcaBYE,169680,171280,that's again why this is my favorite and
9kYYxmcaBYE,171280,174160,this is the only one as a gts model yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,174160,176720,you can't get a turbo or turbo s yes or
9kYYxmcaBYE,176720,178560,turismo and you can get you can't get
9kYYxmcaBYE,178560,180720,across tourism either because gts gts
9kYYxmcaBYE,180720,182080,makes sense for handling and stuff like
9kYYxmcaBYE,182080,184239,that yeah it's it's cool
9kYYxmcaBYE,184239,185840,you get a lot of cool stuff like this
9kYYxmcaBYE,185840,187360,this is a gt steering wheel like you'd
9kYYxmcaBYE,187360,190159,get in a gt3 yeah no it's it makes
9kYYxmcaBYE,190159,192159,perfect sense and it's very very fun to
9kYYxmcaBYE,192159,193599,drive more fun than probably any of the
9kYYxmcaBYE,193599,195280,other ones through cliche corner i think
9kYYxmcaBYE,195280,197360,so because it is fast and you're gonna
9kYYxmcaBYE,197360,199200,get nauseated if you keep ripping it but
9kYYxmcaBYE,199200,201040,it's not as fast as a turbo and that's
9kYYxmcaBYE,201040,202879,why this is my favorite one in the
9kYYxmcaBYE,202879,204560,lineup which is the most cliche thing to
9kYYxmcaBYE,204560,206000,say because it's the sweet swap but it
9kYYxmcaBYE,206000,208239,just is and then you love the wagon
9kYYxmcaBYE,208239,210000,version yeah obviously i'm gonna tell
9kYYxmcaBYE,210000,212480,you i still like the sedan more the
9kYYxmcaBYE,212480,214159,wagon just looks so awkward from that
9kYYxmcaBYE,214159,215760,front three-quarter amazing from every
9kYYxmcaBYE,215760,217280,other angle but that front three-quarter
9kYYxmcaBYE,217280,218879,just kind of ruins it for me you are
9kYYxmcaBYE,218879,220319,right the front three-quarter is not
9kYYxmcaBYE,220319,221920,flattering but every other angle makes
9kYYxmcaBYE,221920,223760,this worth it especially in this mamba
9kYYxmcaBYE,223760,225760,green paint i came off the highway and a
9kYYxmcaBYE,225760,228239,guy was driving by the scion tc he
9kYYxmcaBYE,228239,230159,looked at my car he looked at me and he
9kYYxmcaBYE,230159,232319,did this
9kYYxmcaBYE,232319,234959,nice attention from the scion tc owners
9kYYxmcaBYE,234959,237200,that's that's why it's worth the 200 000
9kYYxmcaBYE,237200,240319,price tag most of the paint i think but
9kYYxmcaBYE,240319,241680,do you like this color more than that
9kYYxmcaBYE,241680,244000,pink one yes way more the frozen berry
9kYYxmcaBYE,244000,245760,way more oh i don't know about that dude
9kYYxmcaBYE,245760,247599,mamba green this looked amazing when we
9kYYxmcaBYE,247599,249439,already reviewed it as a panamera twin
9kYYxmcaBYE,249439,251599,turbo v8 as well yeah let's do some
9kYYxmcaBYE,251599,253360,comparison shots of both of those
9kYYxmcaBYE,253360,255280,because they kind of look similar but
9kYYxmcaBYE,255280,257759,kind of different but even the panamera
9kYYxmcaBYE,257759,259840,sporturismo has a very awkward front
9kYYxmcaBYE,259840,261600,three-quarter as well in my opinion it
9kYYxmcaBYE,261600,263199,does like all the porsche wagons i can
9kYYxmcaBYE,263199,265280,mean kind of any wagon in general that
9kYYxmcaBYE,265280,269520,has that like 63 e63 is an rs6 okay yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,269520,270960,no no it's just the porsches you're
9kYYxmcaBYE,270960,271840,right
9kYYxmcaBYE,271840,274560,this thing just looks so wide low and
9kYYxmcaBYE,274560,275360,just
9kYYxmcaBYE,275360,277680,beefy looking yeah it's nice there are
9kYYxmcaBYE,277680,279199,some differences on the gt model the
9kYYxmcaBYE,279199,280320,front end looks a little bit different
9kYYxmcaBYE,280320,282080,the bumper yeah you don't get the ones
9kYYxmcaBYE,282080,283680,that come up along the bottom oh all the
9kYYxmcaBYE,283680,285280,bumpers can be like slightly different
9kYYxmcaBYE,285280,286800,along the ticons which makes sense and
9kYYxmcaBYE,286800,288320,then the slits below the headlights seem
9kYYxmcaBYE,288320,290080,to be a little bit bigger
9kYYxmcaBYE,290080,291840,slight changes and it's hard to pinpoint
9kYYxmcaBYE,291840,292880,unless you have them all together at
9kYYxmcaBYE,292880,294160,once and same with the driving
9kYYxmcaBYE,294160,295520,characteristics like they all kind of
9kYYxmcaBYE,295520,297759,feel the same as well yeah it is
9kYYxmcaBYE,297759,299759,impossible to get all the cars at once
9kYYxmcaBYE,299759,301680,up here to like test out so like we're
9kYYxmcaBYE,301680,303360,doing our best yeah and this does have
9kYYxmcaBYE,303360,305520,air suspension it is very comfortable in
9kYYxmcaBYE,305520,307840,the sportiest mode it is also not too
9kYYxmcaBYE,307840,310960,stiff for a gts model how about uh looks
9kYYxmcaBYE,310960,313199,wise the wheels they're not color matte
9kYYxmcaBYE,313199,316000,and we know porsche can't sell units
9kYYxmcaBYE,316000,318320,they order of green on green yeah no
9kYYxmcaBYE,318320,320240,these wheels look fantastic they're
9kYYxmcaBYE,320240,322000,black whatever but the wheel design
9kYYxmcaBYE,322000,324880,itself looks great in a bronze or a gold
9kYYxmcaBYE,324880,326240,perfect yeah just like we had in that
9kYYxmcaBYE,326240,327120,audi
9kYYxmcaBYE,327120,328479,i like that a lot more yeah that would
9kYYxmcaBYE,328479,330240,look awesome you probably can do that
9kYYxmcaBYE,330240,331520,with pts or whatever and then what would
9kYYxmcaBYE,331520,333360,be the continental recommended tire for
9kYYxmcaBYE,333360,335680,a sport turismo tycoon the extreme
9kYYxmcaBYE,335680,338479,contact sport and now until june 30th
9kYYxmcaBYE,338479,341680,get up to 140 in visa prepaid cards by
9kYYxmcaBYE,341680,343280,mail with the purchase of four
9kYYxmcaBYE,343280,345039,qualifying continental tires when you
9kYYxmcaBYE,345039,346639,purchase with your continental tire
9kYYxmcaBYE,346639,348560,credit card click the link in the top
9kYYxmcaBYE,348560,350240,comment or in the description below for
9kYYxmcaBYE,350240,352400,more details and then we have regular
9kYYxmcaBYE,352400,354000,brakes we don't have carbon ceramics
9kYYxmcaBYE,354000,356080,because we have red calipers i feel like
9kYYxmcaBYE,356080,358160,that's fine and the wheels look really
9kYYxmcaBYE,358160,360160,good when you have it in its lowest mode
9kYYxmcaBYE,360160,361759,which is sport mode so you can actually
9kYYxmcaBYE,361759,363280,change that through your infotainment
9kYYxmcaBYE,363280,365199,through your chassis height nice yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,365199,366960,it's nice to be able to dump it it's
9kYYxmcaBYE,366960,368880,like dump dumped like it looks fantastic
9kYYxmcaBYE,368880,371600,no it's like a truck
9kYYxmcaBYE,372240,375600,for all you uh gen z that's cisco yes
9kYYxmcaBYE,375600,377520,and since this is an electric car we do
9kYYxmcaBYE,377520,379600,have to talk about electricity yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,379600,382000,what's the range uh so i don't actually
9kYYxmcaBYE,382000,384160,know at the time of filming if i get a
9kYYxmcaBYE,384160,385440,number back i will put it up on the
9kYYxmcaBYE,385440,388160,screen however at 80 this car had about
9kYYxmcaBYE,388160,390479,315 kilometers so i imagine it is more
9kYYxmcaBYE,390479,392960,than that and the turbo is rated at i
9kYYxmcaBYE,392960,395680,think 323 kilometers so just expect
9kYYxmcaBYE,395680,397600,something around that and there is no
9kYYxmcaBYE,397600,399520,epa range at this moment that we can
9kYYxmcaBYE,399520,402000,look up that's why so uh yeah and then
9kYYxmcaBYE,402000,404000,the charging time is the same as all the
9kYYxmcaBYE,404000,406720,other ticons 800 volt architecture 22
9kYYxmcaBYE,406720,408400,and a half minutes to five to eighty
9kYYxmcaBYE,408400,410240,percent whatever all that fun stuff in
9kYYxmcaBYE,410240,412800,the perfectly ideal perfect uh
9kYYxmcaBYE,412800,414560,circumstances you probably won't ever
9kYYxmcaBYE,414560,415680,really get
9kYYxmcaBYE,415680,417599,make sure you have a charger at home yes
9kYYxmcaBYE,417599,418800,exactly it's an electric car you just
9kYYxmcaBYE,418800,421039,have to but then we were talking earlier
9kYYxmcaBYE,421039,423680,about how do we really care about fast
9kYYxmcaBYE,423680,426560,electric cars no like we kind of like
9kYYxmcaBYE,426560,429280,the idea of commuter electric cars
9kYYxmcaBYE,429280,431199,for range but like when it comes to
9kYYxmcaBYE,431199,433360,sporty ones it's kind of like
9kYYxmcaBYE,433360,435440,i feel like i just want the one with the
9kYYxmcaBYE,435440,437520,most range not necessarily the fastest
9kYYxmcaBYE,437520,439680,one like if porsche made like a super
9kYYxmcaBYE,439680,442000,hyper miling lightweight ev that wasn't
9kYYxmcaBYE,442000,444479,fast that would be cool like a 700
9kYYxmcaBYE,444479,446800,kilometer range and like
9kYYxmcaBYE,446800,450000,super slippery yeah very function built
9kYYxmcaBYE,450000,452240,yeah which i think mercedes has just
9kYYxmcaBYE,452240,453919,done with the
9kYYxmcaBYE,453919,455680,i don't even know the model designations
9kYYxmcaBYE,455680,458560,anymore eq s t
9kYYxmcaBYE,458560,460639,suv i don't know it's it looks gorgeous
9kYYxmcaBYE,460639,461680,wasn't there like a isn't there a
9kYYxmcaBYE,461680,463599,volkswagen like something oh yeah the
9kYYxmcaBYE,463599,465680,side curtain xl1 or whatever but that
9kYYxmcaBYE,465680,468080,was like a diesel election oh yeah yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,468080,469520,they don't talk about that oh yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,469520,472160,because it's probably a cheater one yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,472160,473599,that ram got caught doing that too just
9kYYxmcaBYE,473599,474960,recently yeah lots of people still
9kYYxmcaBYE,474960,476960,getting caught over there yeah so i
9kYYxmcaBYE,476960,478639,think that's all i really wanted to talk
9kYYxmcaBYE,478639,480479,about behind the wheel
9kYYxmcaBYE,480479,482319,how's your neck not as bad as a turbo
9kYYxmcaBYE,482319,484560,honestly fine exactly that's why sweet
9kYYxmcaBYE,484560,486000,spot all right let's get you into the
9kYYxmcaBYE,486000,488240,sweet spot of this driver's seat
9kYYxmcaBYE,488240,490720,no taki electric sports sound only no
9kYYxmcaBYE,490720,494080,taki no taki okay
9kYYxmcaBYE,504720,506000,you really feel that two-speed
9kYYxmcaBYE,506000,507280,transmission
9kYYxmcaBYE,507280,509199,i think they added sound to emphasize
9kYYxmcaBYE,509199,511120,the two i think so too like that's the
9kYYxmcaBYE,511120,512159,thing that i noticed the most on the
9kYYxmcaBYE,512159,514399,first launch great job hans zimmer i
9kYYxmcaBYE,514399,516000,don't know i think that's the people i
9kYYxmcaBYE,516000,518159,don't know what's that mercedes uh i
9kYYxmcaBYE,518159,519839,don't know everyone's picking a composer
9kYYxmcaBYE,519839,521039,from a movie that they liked when they
9kYYxmcaBYE,521039,523360,were kids i'm waiting for green day
9kYYxmcaBYE,523360,525120,to start doing uh sounds for some cars
9kYYxmcaBYE,525120,526640,i'm sure dead most will do them because
9kYYxmcaBYE,526640,529600,it's electric music
9kYYxmcaBYE,529600,531360,the new siriusxm station is going to be
9kYYxmcaBYE,531360,532880,uh electric car sounds i wouldn't be
9kYYxmcaBYE,532880,534720,surprised yeah i wouldn't be surprised
9kYYxmcaBYE,534720,536640,if dead most did like mclaren uh ev
9kYYxmcaBYE,536640,538560,sounds because he likes mclarens
9kYYxmcaBYE,538560,540800,and now for a little uh sweet spotness
9kYYxmcaBYE,540800,542640,through the cliche cornerness
9kYYxmcaBYE,542640,544399,yeah dude that steering is it's
9kYYxmcaBYE,544399,547440,telepathic yuri it feels so nice look at
9kYYxmcaBYE,547440,549839,that flow yeah that doesn't feel gross
9kYYxmcaBYE,549839,551200,at all i may not be going on the speed
9kYYxmcaBYE,551200,553440,of lightning but this is the electric
9kYYxmcaBYE,553440,556640,miata wagon of electric cars
9kYYxmcaBYE,556640,558399,i think i still kind of like the slower
9kYYxmcaBYE,558399,559920,rear wheel drive one a little bit more
9kYYxmcaBYE,559920,561600,which we don't get in canada
9kYYxmcaBYE,561600,563279,i think it just like it felt nicer like
9kYYxmcaBYE,563279,565839,i don't need all this speed right but i
9kYYxmcaBYE,565839,567519,do like for speed yeah i don't have the
9kYYxmcaBYE,567519,569680,need for speed no not in this like it is
9kYYxmcaBYE,569680,571600,nice to have but
9kYYxmcaBYE,571600,573040,it'd be nice to just have range but the
9kYYxmcaBYE,573040,574720,thing is like you always want the top
9kYYxmcaBYE,574720,576880,trim like yeah if you're rich the hell
9kYYxmcaBYE,576880,579040,if i want the sweet spot but i'd be okay
9kYYxmcaBYE,579040,580800,with the gta like i'd be even better
9kYYxmcaBYE,580800,582320,with the gts but if you're rich you've
9kYYxmcaBYE,582320,583279,got to show up with something that says
9kYYxmcaBYE,583279,585279,turbo s on it people respect the g and
9kYYxmcaBYE,585279,586880,then you can explain to people why it's
9kYYxmcaBYE,586880,588240,a turbo s even though it's electric and
9kYYxmcaBYE,588240,590560,doesn't have a turbo talk about yourself
9kYYxmcaBYE,590560,592640,more yeah hey go to your turbo charger
9kYYxmcaBYE,592640,594560,just charge your car
9kYYxmcaBYE,594560,596800,always a supercharger a tesla and now
9kYYxmcaBYE,596800,598720,for the stuff that i was very excited
9kYYxmcaBYE,598720,601200,about hopping into this car is we have
9kYYxmcaBYE,601200,603279,color-coded buttons on our infotainment
9kYYxmcaBYE,603279,605200,for once dude my mind was blown when i
9kYYxmcaBYE,605200,607040,first started this car i didn't realize
9kYYxmcaBYE,607040,608959,porsche updated that yeah because most
9kYYxmcaBYE,608959,610480,infotainments over the last three years
9kYYxmcaBYE,610480,612560,have gone to like monochromatics the
9kYYxmcaBYE,612560,614640,same gray or same color and it's hard to
9kYYxmcaBYE,614640,616720,differentiate what icon is which and now
9kYYxmcaBYE,616720,618720,they're bringing it back and so it's
9kYYxmcaBYE,618720,620320,easier to just see and click less
9kYYxmcaBYE,620320,622000,distracting it is great like it looks a
9kYYxmcaBYE,622000,624240,little cartoonish but it's functional
9kYYxmcaBYE,624240,625920,i'm surprised you can't turn that off in
9kYYxmcaBYE,625920,626959,the info entertainment settings like
9kYYxmcaBYE,626959,628720,nothing i could find to go back i feel
9kYYxmcaBYE,628720,630160,like people that would confuse people
9kYYxmcaBYE,630160,632160,too much but i love this great job
9kYYxmcaBYE,632160,633839,porsche whoever's doing this you are you
9kYYxmcaBYE,633839,636560,are fantastic 10 out of 10. and then
9kYYxmcaBYE,636560,637680,this one
9kYYxmcaBYE,637680,639360,has a nice moon roof but it does not
9kYYxmcaBYE,639360,641440,have the option to have the cool one
9kYYxmcaBYE,641440,643360,that changes all the different things
9kYYxmcaBYE,643360,645120,all the tiles i was so excited about
9kYYxmcaBYE,645120,646560,that so we're just gonna steal a clip
9kYYxmcaBYE,646560,648800,from doug demiro's video and show that
9kYYxmcaBYE,648800,650720,doug please don't please don't copyright
9kYYxmcaBYE,650720,652480,strikers yes
9kYYxmcaBYE,652480,654320,and then to control the vents still
9kYYxmcaBYE,654320,656399,through the infotainment which i do not
9kYYxmcaBYE,656399,658000,like and you do not like either yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,658000,659519,still can't get used to it so i've just
9kYYxmcaBYE,659519,661519,left it on diffused and set my auto
9kYYxmcaBYE,661519,663279,temperature and never looked at it again
9kYYxmcaBYE,663279,664720,as the passenger do you like the
9kYYxmcaBYE,664720,667120,passenger screen i do it's entertaining
9kYYxmcaBYE,667120,668560,i like it like i don't really want to
9kYYxmcaBYE,668560,670000,look down because i will probably get
9kYYxmcaBYE,670000,672160,motion sickness but it's cool to have i
9kYYxmcaBYE,672160,674160,didn't look at it one second while you
9kYYxmcaBYE,674160,675200,were driving or anything i was just
9kYYxmcaBYE,675200,677040,looking forward but look at we're going
9kYYxmcaBYE,677040,678560,up in elevation through cliche corner
9kYYxmcaBYE,678560,681920,we're now at 179 meters above sea level
9kYYxmcaBYE,681920,683760,if you had like a nerdy kid or like a
9kYYxmcaBYE,683760,685600,nerdy friend like that would be so
9kYYxmcaBYE,685600,687440,interesting i think it would be and then
9kYYxmcaBYE,687440,689440,how about our gauge cluster i love it it
9kYYxmcaBYE,689440,691200,works really well it's functional i can
9kYYxmcaBYE,691200,692640,see everything yes because it's got the
9kYYxmcaBYE,692640,694079,three gauges in the middle rather than
9kYYxmcaBYE,694079,696480,the four sorry rather than the five on
9kYYxmcaBYE,696480,698000,regular bushes and the steering wheel
9kYYxmcaBYE,698000,699519,feels great the seats are very
9kYYxmcaBYE,699519,700640,comfortable
9kYYxmcaBYE,700640,702560,there's room in the back for me there's
9kYYxmcaBYE,702560,704240,room in the back for me and because it's
9kYYxmcaBYE,704240,706240,a wagon i have extra head room let's
9kYYxmcaBYE,706240,708720,look at the trunk space pretty damn good
9kYYxmcaBYE,708720,711600,not great but nothing not worth it for
9kYYxmcaBYE,711600,714880,me to jump from this to a taikon sedan
9kYYxmcaBYE,714880,716560,it's more worth it for the shape for me
9kYYxmcaBYE,716560,718480,yeah yeah yeah it's more of a looks than
9kYYxmcaBYE,718480,720240,a function yeah and then we also have a
9kYYxmcaBYE,720240,722000,frunk as we have in the normal tycon
9kYYxmcaBYE,722000,724399,which isn't very large smaller than a
9kYYxmcaBYE,724399,726160,911 yes
9kYYxmcaBYE,726160,728240,and then this does have sears xm it does
9kYYxmcaBYE,728240,729600,rewind but
9kYYxmcaBYE,729600,731839,porsche now has a way to toggle through
9kYYxmcaBYE,731839,734240,your favorites so you set up this button
9kYYxmcaBYE,734240,735680,on the steering wheel to go to your next
9kYYxmcaBYE,735680,737279,track right yep
9kYYxmcaBYE,737279,739760,and then in your infotainment in your
9kYYxmcaBYE,739760,741279,radio setting which is red which is
9kYYxmcaBYE,741279,743360,really cool you click on these three
9kYYxmcaBYE,743360,745600,things on the right scroll down to
9kYYxmcaBYE,745600,748000,favorites then you can click play and
9kYYxmcaBYE,748000,749279,when you click this button on the
9kYYxmcaBYE,749279,750240,steering wheel you're just going to
9kYYxmcaBYE,750240,751279,toggle through your favorites so they
9kYYxmcaBYE,751279,752880,finally have a solution because before
9kYYxmcaBYE,752880,753839,it would just go through all your
9kYYxmcaBYE,753839,756000,stations yeah there you go they fixed a
9kYYxmcaBYE,756000,757120,lot of stuff with this updated
9kYYxmcaBYE,757120,758720,infotainment yo shout out porsche
9kYYxmcaBYE,758720,760240,engineer who watches the straight pipes
9kYYxmcaBYE,760240,761760,and figured this all out for us and it
9kYYxmcaBYE,761760,763040,obviously rewinds a serious exam
9kYYxmcaBYE,763040,764399,satellite radio yeah of course of course
9kYYxmcaBYE,764399,765839,course and if you want to rip through
9kYYxmcaBYE,765839,767920,the siriusxm favorites in your own car
9kYYxmcaBYE,767920,769839,get a free three month trial to siriusxm
9kYYxmcaBYE,769839,771440,by going to
9kYYxmcaBYE,771440,773519,or dot com slash the straight pipes and
9kYYxmcaBYE,773519,775120,then we have android auto and apple
9kYYxmcaBYE,775120,776800,carplay and they are color coded when
9kYYxmcaBYE,776800,778399,you're connected to them
9kYYxmcaBYE,778399,780800,shadow color coded shadow color color
9kYYxmcaBYE,780800,782800,that's all i ever wanted i i just i
9kYYxmcaBYE,782800,784000,think they should have an option to
9kYYxmcaBYE,784000,785760,non-color coded so like in demo mode it
9kYYxmcaBYE,785760,786959,looks nice
9kYYxmcaBYE,786959,788160,great it probably helps sell them even
9kYYxmcaBYE,788160,789279,though they probably all sell out anyway
9kYYxmcaBYE,789279,790480,nobody cares
9kYYxmcaBYE,790480,792320,and then cup holders are great as they
9kYYxmcaBYE,792320,794079,are in other tycons they fit cups no
9kYYxmcaBYE,794079,796639,problem risers visors are probably gonna
9kYYxmcaBYE,796639,799120,fail three two one full fail but they
9kYYxmcaBYE,799120,801120,look cool yeah they're race techs just
9kYYxmcaBYE,801120,802880,like the steering wheel is that pretty
9kYYxmcaBYE,802880,805360,much everything with the new tycon sport
9kYYxmcaBYE,805360,807120,turismo i think that's everything with
9kYYxmcaBYE,807120,809120,this one yuri let's get to the price
9kYYxmcaBYE,809120,810560,obviously a lot of money it's a porsche
9kYYxmcaBYE,810560,813519,it's electric this one starts at 152
9kYYxmcaBYE,813519,815040,700.
9kYYxmcaBYE,815040,819440,and this one is optioned out to 185 710
9kYYxmcaBYE,819440,822160,makes sense for what this is it slots in
9kYYxmcaBYE,822160,824000,between a 4s and a turbo because it's
9kYYxmcaBYE,824000,826720,the sweet spot yuri
9kYYxmcaBYE,826720,829120,it really is it is it just like sucks
9kYYxmcaBYE,829120,831040,that we have to say that because it's
9kYYxmcaBYE,831040,832720,true yeah it's the most cliched thing we
9kYYxmcaBYE,832720,835120,could ever say uh cliche corner cliche
9kYYxmcaBYE,835120,838000,stuff it's what it is cliche pipes yeah
9kYYxmcaBYE,838000,838880,and if you're looking to get your own
