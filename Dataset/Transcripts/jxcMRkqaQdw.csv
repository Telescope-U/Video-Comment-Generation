jxcMRkqaQdw,1280,5679,sun tzu and the art of war
jxcMRkqaQdw,7839,15440,chapter one  laying plans  suntsu said the art of war is of vital
jxcMRkqaQdw,15440,22320,importance to the state  it is a matter of life and death a road  either to safety or to ruin
jxcMRkqaQdw,22320,28240,hence it is a subject of inquiry which  can on no account be neglected
jxcMRkqaQdw,28240,36000,the art of war then is governed by five  constant factors to be taken into  account in one's deliberations when
jxcMRkqaQdw,36000,42000,seeking to determine the conditions  obtaining in the field  these are
jxcMRkqaQdw,42000,47680,one the moral law  two  heaven  three
jxcMRkqaQdw,47680,55520,earth  four  the commander  five method and discipline
jxcMRkqaQdw,55520,61760,the moral law causes the people to be in  complete accord with their ruler so that  they will follow him regardless of their
jxcMRkqaQdw,61760,68479,lives undismayed by any danger  heaven signifies night and day cold and
jxcMRkqaQdw,68479,74479,heat times and seasons  earth comprises distances great and
jxcMRkqaQdw,74479,81680,small  danger and security open ground and  narrow passes the chances of life and
jxcMRkqaQdw,81680,88960,death  the commander stands for the virtues of  wisdom sincerity benevolence courage and
jxcMRkqaQdw,88960,95600,strictness  by method and discipline are to be  understood the marshalling of the army
jxcMRkqaQdw,95600,102399,in its proper subdivisions  the graduations of rank among the  officers the maintenance of roads by
jxcMRkqaQdw,102399,108799,which supplies may reach the army and  the control of military expenditure
jxcMRkqaQdw,108799,114000,these five heads should be familiar to  every general he who knows them will be
jxcMRkqaQdw,114000,119200,victorious he who knows him not will  fail
jxcMRkqaQdw,119200,126159,therefore in your deliberations when  seeking to determine the military  conditions let them be made the basis of
jxcMRkqaQdw,126159,132319,a comparison  in this wise  one  which of the two sovereigns is imbued
jxcMRkqaQdw,132319,138879,with the moral law  two  which of the two generals has most  ability
jxcMRkqaQdw,138879,144239,three with whom let the advantages  derive from heaven and earth
jxcMRkqaQdw,144239,149680,four  on which side is discipline most  rigorously enforced
jxcMRkqaQdw,149680,155920,five which army is stronger  six on which side are officers and men
jxcMRkqaQdw,155920,165840,more highly trained  seven  in which army is there the greater  constancy both in reward and punishment
jxcMRkqaQdw,165920,171760,by means of these seven considerations i  can forecast victory or defeat
jxcMRkqaQdw,171760,179280,the general that hearkens to my council  and acts upon it will conquer  let such a one be retained in command
jxcMRkqaQdw,179280,184879,the general that hearkens not to my  council nor acts upon it will suffer  defeat
jxcMRkqaQdw,184879,190879,let such a one be dismissed  while heeding the prophet of my counsel
jxcMRkqaQdw,190879,197599,avail yourselves also of any helpful  circumstances over and beyond the  ordinary rules
jxcMRkqaQdw,197599,204480,accordingly as circumstances are  favorable one should modify one's plans
jxcMRkqaQdw,204720,211200,all warfare is based on deception hence  when able to attack we must seem unable
jxcMRkqaQdw,211200,216239,when using our forces we must seem  inactive when we are near we must make
jxcMRkqaQdw,216239,221280,the enemy believe we are far away when  far away we must make him believe we are
jxcMRkqaQdw,221280,228879,near  hold out baits to entice the enemy feign  disorder and crush him
jxcMRkqaQdw,228879,236000,if he is secure at all points be  prepared for him if he is in superior  strength evade him
jxcMRkqaQdw,236000,241360,if your opponent is a calyric temper  seek to irritate him pretend to be weak
jxcMRkqaQdw,241360,249120,that he may grow arrogant  if he is taking his ease give him no  rest if his forces are united separate
jxcMRkqaQdw,249120,254159,them  attack him when he is unprepared appear
jxcMRkqaQdw,254159,263680,where you are not expected  these military devices leading to  victory must not be divulged beforehand
jxcMRkqaQdw,263680,268800,now the general who wins a battle makes  many calculations in his temple heir the
jxcMRkqaQdw,268800,275600,battle is fought  the general who loses a battle makes but  few calculations beforehand
jxcMRkqaQdw,275600,281759,thus do many calculations lead to  victory and few calculations to defeat
jxcMRkqaQdw,281759,287440,how much more no calculation at all  it is by attention to this point that i
jxcMRkqaQdw,287440,292240,can foresee who is likely to win or lose
jxcMRkqaQdw,294320,301120,chapter 2  waging war  suntsu said in the operations of war
jxcMRkqaQdw,301120,307919,where there are in the field a thousand  swift chariots  as many heavy chariots and a hundred
jxcMRkqaQdw,307919,314240,thousand male glad soldiers with  provisions enough to carry them a  thousandly
jxcMRkqaQdw,314240,320000,the expenditure at home and at the front  including entertainment of guests small
jxcMRkqaQdw,320000,325520,items such as glue and paint and some  spent on chariots and armor
jxcMRkqaQdw,325520,332240,will reach the total of a thousand  ounces of silver per day  such is the cost of raising an army of
jxcMRkqaQdw,332240,338560,one hundred thousand men  when you engage in actual fighting if
jxcMRkqaQdw,338560,344720,victory is long in coming then men's  weapons will grow dull and their ardor  will be damped
jxcMRkqaQdw,344720,351840,if you lay siege to a town you will  exhaust your strength  again if the campaign is protracted the
jxcMRkqaQdw,351840,357280,resources of the state will not be equal  to the strain
jxcMRkqaQdw,357280,363120,now when your weapons are dulled your  ardor damped your strength exhausted and
jxcMRkqaQdw,363120,369600,your treasure spent  other chieftains will spring up to take  advantage of your extremity
jxcMRkqaQdw,369600,376479,then no man however wise will be able to  avert the consequences that must ensue
jxcMRkqaQdw,376479,381919,thus though we have heard of stupid  haste in war cleverness has never been
jxcMRkqaQdw,381919,387680,seen associated with long delays  there is no instance of a country having
jxcMRkqaQdw,387680,392800,benefited from prolonged war it is only  one who is thoroughly acquainted with
jxcMRkqaQdw,392800,400479,the evils of war  that can thoroughly understand the  profitable way of carrying it on
jxcMRkqaQdw,400560,405600,a skillful soldier does not raise a  second levy neither are his supply
jxcMRkqaQdw,405600,410880,wagons loaded more than twice  bring war material with you from home
jxcMRkqaQdw,410880,417280,but forage on the enemy  thus the army will have food enough for  its needs
jxcMRkqaQdw,417280,422319,poverty of the state exchequer causes an  army to be maintained by contributions
jxcMRkqaQdw,422319,428160,from a distance  contributing to maintain an army at a  distance causes the people to be
jxcMRkqaQdw,428160,435440,impoverished  on the other hand the proximity of an  army causes prices to go up
jxcMRkqaQdw,435440,442400,and high prices cause the people's  substance to be drained away  when their substance is drained away the
jxcMRkqaQdw,442400,449039,peasantry will be afflicted by heavy  exactions  with this loss of substance and
jxcMRkqaQdw,449039,455280,exhaustion of strength the homes of the  people will be stripped bare and three  tenths of their income will be
jxcMRkqaQdw,455280,461199,dissipated while government expenses for  broken chariots worn out horses
jxcMRkqaQdw,461199,467919,breastplates and helmets bows and arrows  spears and shields protective mantles
jxcMRkqaQdw,467919,475360,draft oxen and heavy wagons will amount  to four tenths of its total revenue
jxcMRkqaQdw,475360,481919,hence a wise general makes a point of  foraging on the enemy  one cartload of the enemy's provisions
jxcMRkqaQdw,481919,487120,is equivalent to 20 of one's own and  likewise a single pickle from his
jxcMRkqaQdw,487120,492400,prevender is equal to 20 from one's own  store  now
jxcMRkqaQdw,492400,498639,in order to kill the enemy our men must  be roused to anger  that there may be advantage from
jxcMRkqaQdw,498639,505120,defeating the enemy they must have their  rewards  therefore in chariot fighting when ten
jxcMRkqaQdw,505120,512159,or more chariots have been taken those  should be rewarded who took the first  our own flag should be substituted for
jxcMRkqaQdw,512159,517440,those of the enemy and the chariots  mingled and used in conjunction with our  own
jxcMRkqaQdw,517440,524880,the captured soldiers should be kindly  treated and kept  this is called using the conquered foe
jxcMRkqaQdw,524880,530560,to augment one's own strength  in war then let your great object be
jxcMRkqaQdw,530560,537440,victory not lengthy campaigns thus it  may be known that the leader of armies
jxcMRkqaQdw,537440,547720,is the arbiter of the people's fate the  man on whom it depends whether the  nation shall be in peace or in peril
jxcMRkqaQdw,550000,555680,chapter 3 attack by stratagem  sun tzu said
jxcMRkqaQdw,555680,562800,in the practical art of war the best  thing of all is to take the enemy's  country whole and intact to shout and
jxcMRkqaQdw,562800,569120,destroy it is not so good so too it is  better to recapture an army entire than
jxcMRkqaQdw,569120,575279,to destroy it to capture a regiment a  detachment or a company entire than to
jxcMRkqaQdw,575279,582080,destroy them  hence to fight and conquer in all your  battles is not supreme excellence
jxcMRkqaQdw,582080,589040,supreme excellence consists in breaking  the enemy's resistance without fighting
jxcMRkqaQdw,589040,594720,thus the highest form of generalship is  to bulk the enemy's plans the next best
jxcMRkqaQdw,594720,599920,is to prevent the junction of the  enemy's forces the next in order is to
jxcMRkqaQdw,599920,605680,attack the enemy's army in the field and  the worst policy of all is to besiege
jxcMRkqaQdw,605680,611040,walled cities  the rule is not to besiege walled cities
jxcMRkqaQdw,611040,616880,if it can possibly be avoided the  preparation of mantlets movable shelters
jxcMRkqaQdw,616880,622000,and various implements of war will take  up three whole months and the piling up
jxcMRkqaQdw,622000,628720,of mounds over against the walls will  take three months more  the general unable to control his
jxcMRkqaQdw,628720,633760,irritation will launch his men to the  assault like swarming ants with the
jxcMRkqaQdw,633760,639839,result that one third of his men are  slain while the town still remains  untaken
jxcMRkqaQdw,639839,644399,such are the disastrous effects of a  siege
jxcMRkqaQdw,645040,652000,therefore the skilled leader subdues the  enemy's troops without any fighting he  captures their cities without laying
jxcMRkqaQdw,652000,658000,siege to them he overthrows their  kingdom without lengthy operations in  the field
jxcMRkqaQdw,658000,665680,with his forces intact he will dispute  the mastery of the empire and thus  without losing a man his triumph will be
jxcMRkqaQdw,665680,671040,complete  this is the method of attacking by  stratagem
jxcMRkqaQdw,671040,676959,it is the rule in war if our forces are  tend to the enemies one to surround him
jxcMRkqaQdw,676959,684560,if five to one to attack him if twice as  numerous to divide our army into two
jxcMRkqaQdw,684560,691120,if equally matched we can offer battle  is slightly inferior in numbers we can  avoid the enemy
jxcMRkqaQdw,691120,697600,if quite unequal in every way we can  flee from him  hence though an obstinate fight may be
jxcMRkqaQdw,697600,705040,made by a small force  in the end it must be captured by the  larger force
jxcMRkqaQdw,706160,711519,now the general is the bulwark of the  state if the bulwark is complete at all
jxcMRkqaQdw,711519,716720,points the state will be strong  if the bulwark is defective the state
jxcMRkqaQdw,716720,724320,will be weak  there are three ways in which a ruler  can bring misfortune upon his army
jxcMRkqaQdw,724320,730639,by commanding the army to advance or to  retreat being ignorant to the fact that  it cannot obey
jxcMRkqaQdw,730639,736560,this is called hobbling the army  by attempting to govern an army in the
jxcMRkqaQdw,736560,743920,same way as he administers a kingdom  being ignorant of the conditions which  obtain an army this causes restlessness
jxcMRkqaQdw,743920,749200,in the soldiers minds  by employing the officers of his army
jxcMRkqaQdw,749200,755519,without discrimination through ignorance  of the military principle of adaption to  circumstances
jxcMRkqaQdw,755519,760959,this shakes the confidence of the  soldiers  but when the army is restless and
jxcMRkqaQdw,760959,768000,distrustful trouble is sure to come from  the other feudal princes  this is simply bringing anarchy into the
jxcMRkqaQdw,768000,773839,army and flinging victory away  thus we may know that there are five
jxcMRkqaQdw,773839,778880,essentials for victory  one he will win who knows when to fight
jxcMRkqaQdw,778880,784959,and when not to fight  two he will win who knows how to handle
jxcMRkqaQdw,784959,792240,both superior and inferior forces  3. he will win whose army is animated by
jxcMRkqaQdw,792240,799519,the same spirit throughout all its ranks  4. he will win who prepared himself
jxcMRkqaQdw,799519,805920,waits to take the enemy unprepared  5. he will win who has military capacity
jxcMRkqaQdw,805920,813760,and is not interfered with by the  sovereign  hence the saying  if you know the enemy and know yourself
jxcMRkqaQdw,813760,820560,you need not fear the result of a  hundred battles  if you know yourself but not the enemy
jxcMRkqaQdw,820560,826720,for every victory gained you will also  suffer a defeat  if you know neither the enemy nor
jxcMRkqaQdw,826720,831680,yourself you will succumb in every  battle
jxcMRkqaQdw,833760,841920,chapter 4 tactical dispositions  suntsu said the good fighters of old
jxcMRkqaQdw,841920,848240,first put themselves beyond the  possibility of defeat and then waited  for an opportunity of defeating the
jxcMRkqaQdw,848240,855920,enemy  to secure ourselves against defeat lies  in our own hands but the opportunity of
jxcMRkqaQdw,855920,863199,defeating the enemy is provided by the  enemy himself  thus the good fighter is able to secure
jxcMRkqaQdw,863199,870000,himself against defeat but cannot make  certain of defeating the enemy  hence the saying one may know how to
jxcMRkqaQdw,870000,876160,conquer without being able to do it  security against defeat implies
jxcMRkqaQdw,876160,882720,defensive tactics  ability to defeat the enemy means taking  the offensive
jxcMRkqaQdw,882720,890079,standing on the defensive indicates  insufficient strength  attacking a super abundance of strength
jxcMRkqaQdw,890079,895920,the general who is skilled in defense  hides in the most secret recesses of the  earth
jxcMRkqaQdw,895920,901120,he who is skilled in attack flashes  falls from the topmost heights of heaven
jxcMRkqaQdw,901120,907199,thus on one hand we have ability to  protect ourselves on the other a victory
jxcMRkqaQdw,907199,914320,that is complete  to see victory only when it is within  the can of the common herd is not the
jxcMRkqaQdw,914320,921120,acme of excellence  neither is it the acme of excellence if  you fight and conquer and the whole
jxcMRkqaQdw,921120,926480,empire says well done  to lift an autumn hair is no sign of
jxcMRkqaQdw,926480,932079,great strength  to see the sun and moon is no sign of  sharp sight
jxcMRkqaQdw,932079,938320,to hear the noise of thunder is no sign  of a quick ear  what the ancients called a clever
jxcMRkqaQdw,938320,944240,fighter is one who not only wins but  excels in winning with ease
jxcMRkqaQdw,944240,950079,hence his victories bring him neither  reputation for wisdom nor credit for  courage
jxcMRkqaQdw,950079,957839,he wins his battles by making no  mistakes making no mistakes is what  establishes the certainty of victory for
jxcMRkqaQdw,957839,964560,it means conquering an enemy that is  already defeated  hence the skillful fighter puts himself
jxcMRkqaQdw,964560,971759,into a position which makes defeat  impossible and does not miss the moment  for defeating the enemy
jxcMRkqaQdw,971759,977040,thus it is that in war the victorious  strategist only seeks battle after the
jxcMRkqaQdw,977040,982160,victory has been won whereas he who is  destined to defeat first fights and
jxcMRkqaQdw,982160,988880,afterwards looks for victory  the consummate leader cultivates the
jxcMRkqaQdw,988880,995199,moral law and strictly adheres to method  and discipline  thus it is in his power to control
jxcMRkqaQdw,995199,1001360,success  in respect of military method we have  firstly measurement
jxcMRkqaQdw,1001360,1006720,secondly estimation of quantity  thirdly calculation
jxcMRkqaQdw,1006720,1012560,fourthly balancing of chances fifthly  victory
jxcMRkqaQdw,1012560,1018639,measurement owes its existence to earth  estimation of quantity to measurement
jxcMRkqaQdw,1018639,1024798,calculation to estimation of quantity  balancing of chances to calculation
jxcMRkqaQdw,1024798,1031600,and victory to balancing of chances  a victorious army opposed to a routed
jxcMRkqaQdw,1031600,1037120,one is as a pound weight placed in a  scale against a single grain
jxcMRkqaQdw,1037120,1046240,the on rush of a conquering force is  like the bursting of pent-up waters into  a chasm a thousand fathoms deep
jxcMRkqaQdw,1047360,1053360,chapter five  energy  sun tzu said the control of a large
jxcMRkqaQdw,1053360,1061280,force is the same principle as the  control of a few men it is merely a  question of dividing up their numbers
jxcMRkqaQdw,1061280,1068240,fighting with a large army under your  command is no wise different from  fighting with a small one it is merely a
jxcMRkqaQdw,1068240,1074000,question of instituting signs and  signals  to ensure that your whole host may
jxcMRkqaQdw,1074000,1080640,withstand the brunt of the enemy's  attack and remain unshaken  this is effective by maneuvers direct
jxcMRkqaQdw,1080640,1088000,and indirect  then the impact of your army may be like  a grindstone dashed against an egg this
jxcMRkqaQdw,1088000,1095039,is affected by the science of weak  points and strong  in all fighting the direct method may be
jxcMRkqaQdw,1095039,1101600,used for joining battle but indirect  methods will be needed in order to  secure victory
jxcMRkqaQdw,1101600,1106960,indirect tactics efficiently applied are  inexhaustible as heaven and earth and
jxcMRkqaQdw,1106960,1112400,ending as the flow of rivers and streams  like the sun and moon they end but to
jxcMRkqaQdw,1112400,1118799,begin anew like the four seasons they  pass away to return once more
jxcMRkqaQdw,1118799,1125679,there are not more than five musical  notes yet the combinations of these five  give rise to more melodies than can ever
jxcMRkqaQdw,1125679,1133679,be heard  there are not more than five primary  colors blue yellow red white black
jxcMRkqaQdw,1133679,1140320,yet in combination they produce more  hues that can ever be seen  there are not more than five cardinal
jxcMRkqaQdw,1140320,1145760,tastes sour acrid salt sweet bitter
jxcMRkqaQdw,1145760,1150880,yet combinations of them yield more  flavors than can ever be tasted
jxcMRkqaQdw,1150880,1158080,in battles there are not more than two  methods of attack the direct and the  indirect yet these two in combination
jxcMRkqaQdw,1158080,1163760,give rise to an endless series of  maneuvers  the direct and the indirect lead on to
jxcMRkqaQdw,1163760,1169360,each other in turn it is like moving in  a circle you never come to an end who
jxcMRkqaQdw,1169360,1176240,can exhaust the possibilities of their  combination  the onset of troops is like the rush of
jxcMRkqaQdw,1176240,1182880,a torrent which will even roll stones  along in its course  the quality of decision is like the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1182880,1188559,well-timed swoop of a falcon which  enables it to strike and destroy its  victim
jxcMRkqaQdw,1188559,1194480,therefore the good fighter will be  terrible in his onset and prompt in his  decision
jxcMRkqaQdw,1194480,1199520,energy may be likened to the bending of  a crossbow decision to the releasing of
jxcMRkqaQdw,1199520,1206320,a trigger  amid the turmoil and tumult of battle  there may be seeming disorder and yet no
jxcMRkqaQdw,1206320,1213520,real disorder at all  amid confusion and chaos your array may  be without head or tail yet it will be
jxcMRkqaQdw,1213520,1221120,proof against defeat  simulated disorder postulates perfect  discipline simulated fear postulates
jxcMRkqaQdw,1221120,1227360,courage simulated weakness postulates  strength  hiding order between the cloak of
jxcMRkqaQdw,1227360,1232880,disorder is simply a question of  subdivision  concealing courage under a show of
jxcMRkqaQdw,1232880,1238559,timidity presupposes a fund of latent  energy masking strength with weakness is
jxcMRkqaQdw,1238559,1244880,to be affected by tactical dispositions  thus one who is skillful at keeping the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1244880,1250480,enemy on the move maintains deceitful  appearances according to which the enemy  will act
jxcMRkqaQdw,1250480,1256960,he sacrifices something that the enemy  may snatch at  by holding our baits he keeps him on the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1256960,1262640,march then with the body of pikmin he  lies in wait for him
jxcMRkqaQdw,1262640,1269840,the clever competent looks to the effect  of combined energy does not require too  much from individuals
jxcMRkqaQdw,1269840,1275520,hence his ability to pick out the right  men and utilize combined energy
jxcMRkqaQdw,1275520,1282640,when he utilizes combined energy his  fighting men become as it were like onto  rolling logs or stones
jxcMRkqaQdw,1282640,1289760,for it is in the nature of a log or a  stone to remain motionless on level  ground and to move when on a slope
jxcMRkqaQdw,1289760,1296000,if four cornered to come to a standstill  but if round shaped to go rolling down
jxcMRkqaQdw,1296000,1302720,thus the energy developed by good  fighting men is as the momentum of a  round stone rolled down a mountain
jxcMRkqaQdw,1302720,1308480,thousands of feet in height  so much on the subject of energy
jxcMRkqaQdw,1310559,1316640,chapter six  weak points and strong  sun tzu said whoever is first in the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1316640,1323919,field and awaits the coming of the enemy  will be fresh for the fight whoever is  second in the field and has to hasten to
jxcMRkqaQdw,1323919,1330880,battle will arrive exhausted  therefore the clever combatant imposes  his will on the enemy but does not allow
jxcMRkqaQdw,1330880,1336799,the enemy's will to be imposed on him  by holding out advantages to him he can
jxcMRkqaQdw,1336799,1342799,cause the enemy to approach of his own  accord  or by inflicting damage he can make it
jxcMRkqaQdw,1342799,1348320,impossible for the enemy to draw near if  the enemy is taking his ease he can
jxcMRkqaQdw,1348320,1355440,harass him  if well supplied with food he can starve  him out  if quietly encamped he can force him to
jxcMRkqaQdw,1355440,1361200,move  appear at points which the enemy must  hasten to defend
jxcMRkqaQdw,1361200,1367200,march swiftly to places where you are  not expected  an army may march great distances
jxcMRkqaQdw,1367200,1373520,without distress if it marches through  country where the enemy is not  you can be sure of succeeding in your
jxcMRkqaQdw,1373520,1379039,attacks if you only attack places which  are undefended  you can ensure the safety of your
jxcMRkqaQdw,1379039,1386400,defense if you only hold positions that  cannot be attacked  hence that general is skillful attack
jxcMRkqaQdw,1386400,1392080,whose opponent does not know what to  defend  and he is skillful in defense whose
jxcMRkqaQdw,1392080,1399440,opponent does not know what to attack  no divine art of subtlety and secrecy
jxcMRkqaQdw,1399440,1407360,through you we learn to be invisible  through you inaudible and hence we can  hold the enemy's fate in our hands
jxcMRkqaQdw,1407360,1413360,you may advance and be absolutely  irresistible if you make for the enemy's  weak points
jxcMRkqaQdw,1413360,1420000,you may retire and be safe for pursuit  if your movements are more rapid than  those of the enemy
jxcMRkqaQdw,1420000,1426559,if we wish to fight the enemy can be  forced to an engagement even though he  be sheltered behind a high rampart and a
jxcMRkqaQdw,1426559,1433039,deep ditch  all we need to do is attack some other  place that he will be obliged to relieve
jxcMRkqaQdw,1433039,1439360,if we do not wish to fight we can  prevent the enemy from engaging us even  though the lines of our encampment be
jxcMRkqaQdw,1439360,1446400,merely traced out on the ground all we  need to do is to throw something odd and  unaccountable in his way
jxcMRkqaQdw,1446400,1453200,by discovering the enemy's dispositions  and remaining invisible ourselves we can  keep our forces concentrated while the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1453200,1459440,enemies must be divided  we can form a single united body while
jxcMRkqaQdw,1459440,1466320,the enemy must split up into fractions  hence there will be a hole pitted  against separate parts of a hole which
jxcMRkqaQdw,1466320,1471679,means that we shall be many to the  enemy's few  and if we are able thus to attack an
jxcMRkqaQdw,1471679,1477679,inferior force with the superior one our  opponents will be in dire straits
jxcMRkqaQdw,1477679,1483679,the spot where we intend to fight must  not be made known for then the enemy  will have to prepare against a possible
jxcMRkqaQdw,1483679,1490400,attack at several different points and  his forces being thus distributed in  many directions the numbers we shall
jxcMRkqaQdw,1490400,1495440,have to face at any given point will be  proportionately few
jxcMRkqaQdw,1495440,1501919,four should the enemy strengthen his van  he will weaken his rear should he  strengthen his rear he will weaken his
jxcMRkqaQdw,1501919,1508159,van should he strengthen his left he  will weaken his right should he  strengthen his right he will weaken his
jxcMRkqaQdw,1508159,1515799,left  if he sends reinforcements everywhere he  will everywhere be weak
jxcMRkqaQdw,1516720,1523039,numerical weakness comes from having to  prepare against possible attacks  numerical strength from compelling our
jxcMRkqaQdw,1523039,1529120,adversary to make these preparations  against us  knowing the place and the time of the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1529120,1534480,coming battle we may concentrate from  the greatest distances in order to fight
jxcMRkqaQdw,1534480,1541760,but if neither time nor place be known  then the left wing will be impotent to  sucker the right the right equally
jxcMRkqaQdw,1541760,1548799,impotent to sucker the left  the van unable to relieve the rear or  the rear to support the van
jxcMRkqaQdw,1548799,1555440,how much more so if the furthest  portions of the army are anything under  a hundred lie apart and even the nearest
jxcMRkqaQdw,1555440,1562320,are separated by several li  though according to my estimate the  soldiers away exceeded our only number
jxcMRkqaQdw,1562320,1569840,that shall advantage them nothing in the  matter of victory  i say then that victory can be achieved
jxcMRkqaQdw,1569840,1576480,though the enemy be stronger in numbers  we may prevent him from fighting schemes  as to discover his plans and the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1576480,1583520,likelihood of their success  arouse him and learn the principle of  his activity or inactivity
jxcMRkqaQdw,1583520,1590400,force him to reveal himself so as to  find out his vulnerable spots  carefully compare the opposing army with
jxcMRkqaQdw,1590400,1596880,your own so that you may know where  strength is super abundant and where it  is deficient
jxcMRkqaQdw,1596880,1603760,in making tactical dispositions the  highest pitch you can attain is to  conceal them conceal your dispositions
jxcMRkqaQdw,1603760,1611039,and you will be safe from the prying of  the subtlest spies from the machinations  of the wisest brains
jxcMRkqaQdw,1611039,1617440,how victory may be produced for them out  of the enemy's own tactics  that is what the multitude cannot
jxcMRkqaQdw,1617440,1624000,comprehend  all men can see the tactics whereby i  conquer but what none can seize the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1624000,1630640,strategy out of which victory is evolved  do not repeat the tactics which have
jxcMRkqaQdw,1630640,1637440,gained you one victory but let your  methods be regulated by the infinite  variety of circumstances
jxcMRkqaQdw,1637440,1642640,military tactics are like underwater for  water in its natural course runs away
jxcMRkqaQdw,1642640,1648080,from high places and hastens downwards  so in war the way is to avoid what is
jxcMRkqaQdw,1648080,1655679,strong and to strike at what is weak  water shapes its course according to the  nature of the ground over which it flows
jxcMRkqaQdw,1655679,1662559,the soldier works out his victory in  relation to the foe whom he is facing  therefore just as water retains no
jxcMRkqaQdw,1662559,1668640,constant shape so in warfare there are  no constant conditions  he who can modify his tactics in
jxcMRkqaQdw,1668640,1675600,relation to his opponent and thereby  succeed in winning may be called a  heaven-born captain
jxcMRkqaQdw,1675600,1683679,the five elements water fire wood metal  earth are not always equally predominant
jxcMRkqaQdw,1683679,1688720,the four seasons make way for each other  in turn there are short days and long
jxcMRkqaQdw,1688720,1693760,the moon has its periods of waning and  waxing
jxcMRkqaQdw,1695520,1702320,chapter 7 maneuvering  sun tzu said  in war the general receives his command
jxcMRkqaQdw,1702320,1708000,from the sovereign  having collected an army and  concentrated his forces he must blend
jxcMRkqaQdw,1708000,1713039,and harmonize the different elements  thereof before pitching his camp
jxcMRkqaQdw,1713039,1718240,after that comes tactical maneuvering  than which there is nothing more  difficult
jxcMRkqaQdw,1718240,1726960,the difficulty of tactical maneuvering  consists in turning the devious into the  direct and misfortune into gain
jxcMRkqaQdw,1726960,1732240,thus to take on long and sequitus root  after enticing the enemy out of the way
jxcMRkqaQdw,1732240,1741279,and those starting after him to contrive  to reach the goal before him shows  knowledge of the artifice of deviation
jxcMRkqaQdw,1741360,1746799,maneuvering with an army is advantageous  with an undisciplined multitude most
jxcMRkqaQdw,1746799,1753360,dangerous  if you set a fully equipped army in  march in order to snatch an advantage
jxcMRkqaQdw,1753360,1758720,the chances are that you will be too  late  on the other hand to detach a flying
jxcMRkqaQdw,1758720,1763919,column for the purpose involves the  sacrifice of its baggage and stores
jxcMRkqaQdw,1763919,1771039,thus if you order your men to roll up  their buff coats and make forced marches  without halting day or night covering
jxcMRkqaQdw,1771039,1778320,double the usual distance at a stretch  doing a hundred li in order to rest an  advantage the leaders of all your three
jxcMRkqaQdw,1778320,1783840,divisions will fall into the hands of  the enemy  the stronger men will be in front the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1783840,1789120,jaded ones will fall behind and on this  plan only one tenth of your army will
jxcMRkqaQdw,1789120,1795520,reach its destination  if you march 50 li in order to  outmaneuver the enemy you will lose the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1795520,1802559,leader of your first division and only  half your force will reach the goal  if you march 30 li with the same object
jxcMRkqaQdw,1802559,1809840,two-thirds of your army will arrive  we may take it then that an army without  its baggage train is lost without
jxcMRkqaQdw,1809840,1815919,provisions it is lost without basis of  supply it is lost
jxcMRkqaQdw,1816480,1822080,we cannot enter into alliance until we  are acquainted with the designs of our  neighbors
jxcMRkqaQdw,1822080,1828000,we're not fit to lead an army on the  march unless we are familiar with the  face of the country its mountains and
jxcMRkqaQdw,1828000,1833679,forests its pitfalls and precipices  its marshes and swamps
jxcMRkqaQdw,1833679,1839760,we shall be unable to turn natural  advantage to account unless we make use  of local guides
jxcMRkqaQdw,1839760,1846640,in war practice dissimulation and you  will succeed  whether to concentrate or to divide your
jxcMRkqaQdw,1846640,1852000,troops must be decided by circumstances  let your rapidity be that of the wind
jxcMRkqaQdw,1852000,1858159,your compactness that of the forest  in raiding and plundering be like fire
jxcMRkqaQdw,1858159,1863200,immovability is like a mountain  let your plans be dark and impenetrable
jxcMRkqaQdw,1863200,1869279,as night and when you move fall like a  thunderbolt  when you plunder a countryside let the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1869279,1874559,spoil be divided amongst your men when  you capture new territory cut it up into
jxcMRkqaQdw,1874559,1880720,allotments for the benefit of the  soldiery  ponder and deliberate before you make a
jxcMRkqaQdw,1880720,1888159,move he will conquer who has learned the  artifice of deviation  such is the art of maneuvering
jxcMRkqaQdw,1888159,1893279,the book of army management says on the  field of battle the spoken word does not
jxcMRkqaQdw,1893279,1900480,carry far enough  hence the institution of gongs and drums  nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly
jxcMRkqaQdw,1900480,1907919,enough  hence the institution of banners and  flags  gongs and drums banners and flags are
jxcMRkqaQdw,1907919,1913840,means whereby the ears and eyes of the  host may be focused on one particular  point
jxcMRkqaQdw,1913840,1920799,the host thus forming a single united  body it is impossible either for the  brave to advance alone or for the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1920799,1927760,cowardly to retreat alone  this is the art of handling large masses  of men
jxcMRkqaQdw,1927760,1935440,in night fighting then make much use of  signal fires and drums and in fighting  by day are flags and banners as a means
jxcMRkqaQdw,1935440,1940640,of influencing the ears and eyes of your  army the whole army may be robbed of its
jxcMRkqaQdw,1940640,1947760,spirit a commander-in-chief may be  robbed of his presence of mind  now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the
jxcMRkqaQdw,1947760,1953760,morning by noonday it has begun to flag  and in the evening his mind is bent only
jxcMRkqaQdw,1953760,1961200,on returning to camp  a clever general therefore avoids an  army when the spirit is keen but attacks
jxcMRkqaQdw,1961200,1968480,it when it is sluggish and inclined to  return  this is the art of studying moods
jxcMRkqaQdw,1968480,1974880,disciplined and calm to await the  appearance of disorder and hubbub  amongst the enemy this is the art of
jxcMRkqaQdw,1974880,1982640,retaining self-possession  to be near the goal while the enemy is  still far from it to wait at ease while
jxcMRkqaQdw,1982640,1988799,the enemy is toiling and struggling  to be well fed while the enemy is  famished
jxcMRkqaQdw,1988799,1994559,this is the art of husband england's  strength  to refrain from intercepting an enemy
jxcMRkqaQdw,1994559,2001919,whose banners are in perfect order to  refrain from attacking an army drawn up  in calm and confident array
jxcMRkqaQdw,2001919,2008640,this is the art of studying  circumstances  it is a military axiom not to advance
jxcMRkqaQdw,2008640,2013760,uphill against the enemy nor to oppose  him when he comes downhill
jxcMRkqaQdw,2013760,2019919,do not pursue an enemy who simulates  flight do not attack soldiers whose  temper is keen
jxcMRkqaQdw,2019919,2026320,do not swallow bait offered by the enemy  do not interfere with an army that is  returning home
jxcMRkqaQdw,2026320,2031519,when you surround an army leave an  outlet free do not press a desperate foe
jxcMRkqaQdw,2031519,2038158,too hard  such is the art of warfare
jxcMRkqaQdw,2042000,2049760,chapter 8 variation in tactics  sun tzu said in war the general receives
jxcMRkqaQdw,2049760,2055679,his commands from the sovereign collects  his army and concentrates his forces
jxcMRkqaQdw,2055679,2060878,when in difficult country do not in camp  in country where high roads intersect
jxcMRkqaQdw,2060878,2066878,join hands with your allies do not  linger in dangerously isolated positions
jxcMRkqaQdw,2066878,2074480,in hammed in situations you must resort  to stratagem  in desperate position you must fight
jxcMRkqaQdw,2074480,2079919,there are roads which must not be  followed armies which must not be  attacked
jxcMRkqaQdw,2079919,2085599,towns which must be besieged positions  which must not be contested
jxcMRkqaQdw,2085599,2091760,command of the sovereign which must not  be obeyed  the general who thoroughly understands
jxcMRkqaQdw,2091760,2098480,the advantages that accompany variation  of tactics knows how to handle his  troops
jxcMRkqaQdw,2098480,2104160,the general who does not understand  these may be well acquainted with the  configuration of the country yet he will
jxcMRkqaQdw,2104160,2108960,not be able to turn his knowledge to  practical account
jxcMRkqaQdw,2109280,2114800,so the student of war who is unversed in  the art of war of varying his plans even
jxcMRkqaQdw,2114800,2121200,though he be acquainted with the five  advantages will fail to make the best  use of his men
jxcMRkqaQdw,2121200,2129200,hence in the wise leaders plans  considerations of advantage and of  disadvantage will be blended together
jxcMRkqaQdw,2129200,2135760,if our expectation of advantage be  tempered in this way we may succeed in  accomplishing the essential part of our
jxcMRkqaQdw,2135760,2141599,schemes  if on the other hand in the midst of  difficulties we are always ready to
jxcMRkqaQdw,2141599,2146640,seize an advantage we may extricate  ourselves from misfortune
jxcMRkqaQdw,2146640,2154160,reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting  damage on them and make trouble for them  and keep them constantly engaged
jxcMRkqaQdw,2154160,2159440,hold out specious alermans and make them  rush to any given point
jxcMRkqaQdw,2159440,2164960,the art of war teaches us to rely not on  the likelihood of the enemies not coming
jxcMRkqaQdw,2164960,2170160,but on our own readiness to receive him  not on the chance of his not attacking
jxcMRkqaQdw,2170160,2175680,but rather on the fact that we have made  our position unassailable
jxcMRkqaQdw,2175920,2182240,there are five dangerous faults which  may affect a general  one recklessness which leads to
jxcMRkqaQdw,2182240,2189760,destruction  two  cowardice which leads to capture  3. a hasty temper which can be provoked
jxcMRkqaQdw,2189760,2195760,by insults  4. a delicacy of honor which is  sensitive to shame
jxcMRkqaQdw,2195760,2202720,5.  over-solicitude for his men which  exposes him to worry and trouble
jxcMRkqaQdw,2202720,2208640,these are the five besetting sins of a  general ruiners to the conduct of war
jxcMRkqaQdw,2208640,2217200,when an army is overthrown and its  leader slain the cause will surely be  found among these five dangerous faults
jxcMRkqaQdw,2217200,2221359,let them be subject of meditation
jxcMRkqaQdw,2223040,2230000,chapter nine the army on the march  sun tzu said we come now to the question
jxcMRkqaQdw,2230000,2236640,of encamping the army and observing  signs of the enemy  pass quickly over mountains and keep in
jxcMRkqaQdw,2236640,2244000,the neighborhood of valleys  camp in high places facing the sun do  not climb heights in order to fight so
jxcMRkqaQdw,2244000,2250560,much for mountain warfare  after crossing a river you should get  far away from it
jxcMRkqaQdw,2250560,2258160,when an invading force crosses a river  in its onward march do not advance to  meet it midstream it will be best to let
jxcMRkqaQdw,2258160,2264320,half the army get across and then  deliver your attack  if you are anxious to fight you should
jxcMRkqaQdw,2264320,2271440,not go to meet the invader near a river  which he has to cross  more your craft higher up than the enemy
jxcMRkqaQdw,2271440,2278880,and facing the sun do not move upstream  to meet the enemy  so much for river warfare
jxcMRkqaQdw,2278880,2285280,in crossing salt marshes your sole  concern should be to get over them  quickly without any delay
jxcMRkqaQdw,2285280,2292240,if forced to fight in a salt marsh you  should have water and grass near you and  get your back to a clump of trees
jxcMRkqaQdw,2292240,2298720,so much for operations in salt marshes  in dry level country take up an easily
jxcMRkqaQdw,2298720,2305680,accessible position with rising ground  to your right and on your rear so that  the danger may be in front and safety
jxcMRkqaQdw,2305680,2310720,lie behind  so much for campaigning in flat country
jxcMRkqaQdw,2310720,2317200,these are four useful branches of  military knowledge which enabled the  yellow emperor to vanquish four several
jxcMRkqaQdw,2317200,2322320,sovereigns  all armies prefer high ground to low and
jxcMRkqaQdw,2322320,2329040,sunny places to dark  if you are careful with your men and  camp on hard ground the army will be
jxcMRkqaQdw,2329040,2334079,free from disease of every kind and this  will spell victory
jxcMRkqaQdw,2334079,2341599,when you come to a hill or a bank occupy  the sunny side with the slope on your  right rear thus you will at once act for
jxcMRkqaQdw,2341599,2347280,the benefit of your soldiers and utilize  the natural advantages of the ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,2347280,2354000,when in consequence of heavy rains up  country a river which you wish to afford  is swollen and flecked with foam you
jxcMRkqaQdw,2354000,2359359,must wait till it subsides  country in which there are precipitous
jxcMRkqaQdw,2359359,2365119,cliffs with torrents running between  deep natural hollows confined places
jxcMRkqaQdw,2365119,2370640,tangled thickets quagmires and crevices  should be left with all possible speed
jxcMRkqaQdw,2370640,2377680,and not approached  while we keep away from such places we  should get the enemy to approach them
jxcMRkqaQdw,2377680,2384480,while we face them we should let the  enemy have them on its rear if in the  neighborhood of your camp there should
jxcMRkqaQdw,2384480,2389599,be any hidden country ponds surrounded  by aquatic grass hollow basins filled
jxcMRkqaQdw,2389599,2395920,with reeds or woods with thick  undergrowth they must be carefully  routed out and searched for these are
jxcMRkqaQdw,2395920,2402000,places where men in ambush or insidious  spies are likely to be lurking
jxcMRkqaQdw,2402000,2408960,when the enemy is close at hand and  remains quiet he is relying on the  natural strength of his position
jxcMRkqaQdw,2408960,2415280,when he keeps aloof and tries to provoke  a battle he is anxious for the other  side to advance
jxcMRkqaQdw,2415280,2420800,if his place of encampment is easy of  access he is tendering a bait
jxcMRkqaQdw,2420800,2428079,movement amongst the trees of a forest  shows that the enemy is advancing  the appearance of a number of screens in
jxcMRkqaQdw,2428079,2433440,the midst of thick grass means that the  enemy wants to make us suspicious
jxcMRkqaQdw,2433440,2438560,the rising of birds that flight is the  sign of an ambuscade startled beast
jxcMRkqaQdw,2438560,2443760,indicate that a sudden attack is coming  when there is dust rising in a high
jxcMRkqaQdw,2443760,2449200,column it is the sign of chariots  advancing  when the dust is low but spread over a
jxcMRkqaQdw,2449200,2454560,wide area it be tokens the approach of  infantry  when it branches out in different
jxcMRkqaQdw,2454560,2461520,directions it shows that parties have  been sent to collect firewood  a few clouds of dust moving to and fro
jxcMRkqaQdw,2461520,2467359,signify that the army is in camping  humble words and increase preparations
jxcMRkqaQdw,2467359,2472960,are signs that the enemy is about to  advance  violent language and driving forward as
jxcMRkqaQdw,2472960,2478720,if to attack are signs that he will  retreat  when the light chariots come out first
jxcMRkqaQdw,2478720,2484400,and take up a position on the wings it  is a sign that the enemy is forming for  battle
jxcMRkqaQdw,2484400,2490560,peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn  covenant indicate a plot
jxcMRkqaQdw,2490560,2497359,when there is much running about and the  soldiers fall into rank it means that  the critical moment has come
jxcMRkqaQdw,2497359,2502560,when some are seen advancing and some  retreating it is allure
jxcMRkqaQdw,2502560,2510160,when the soldiers stand leaning on their  spears they are faint from want of  food if those who are sent to draw water
jxcMRkqaQdw,2510160,2515440,begin by drinking themselves the army is  suffering from thirst
jxcMRkqaQdw,2515440,2522880,if the enemy sees an advantage to be  gained and makes no effort to secure it  the soldiers are exhausted
jxcMRkqaQdw,2522880,2528400,if birds gather on any spot it is  unoccupied clamour by night be tokens
jxcMRkqaQdw,2528400,2534960,nervousness  if there is a disturbance in the camp  the general's authority is weak if the
jxcMRkqaQdw,2534960,2543280,banners and flags are shifted about  sedition is afoot if the officers are  angry it means the men are weary
jxcMRkqaQdw,2543280,2549680,when an army feeds its horses with grain  and kills its cattle for food and when  the men do not hang their cookie bots
jxcMRkqaQdw,2549680,2555680,over the campfires showing that they  will not return to their tents you may  know that they are determined to fight
jxcMRkqaQdw,2555680,2563200,to the death  the sign of men whispering together in  small knots or speaking in subdued tones
jxcMRkqaQdw,2563200,2569839,points to disaffection amongst the rank  and file  two frequent rewards signify that the
jxcMRkqaQdw,2569839,2577119,enemies at the end of his resources  too many punishments betray a condition  of dire distress
jxcMRkqaQdw,2577119,2585440,to begin by bluster but afterwards to  take fright at the enemy's numbers shows  a supreme lack of intelligence
jxcMRkqaQdw,2585440,2592240,when envoys are sent with compliments in  their mouths it is a sign that the enemy  wishes for a truce
jxcMRkqaQdw,2592240,2599680,if the enemy's troops march up angrily  and remain facing ours for a long time  without either joining battle or taking
jxcMRkqaQdw,2599680,2607440,themselves off again the situation is  one that demands great vigilance and  circumspection
jxcMRkqaQdw,2607440,2614240,if our troops are no more in numbers  than the enemy that is amply sufficient  it only means that no direct attack can
jxcMRkqaQdw,2614240,2620400,be made  what we can do is simply to concentrate  all our available strength keep a close
jxcMRkqaQdw,2620400,2626880,watch on the enemy and obtain  reinforcements  he who exercises no forethought but
jxcMRkqaQdw,2626880,2633200,makes light of his opponents is sure to  be captured by them  if soldiers are punished before they
jxcMRkqaQdw,2633200,2638480,have grown attached to you they will not  prove submissive and unless submissive
jxcMRkqaQdw,2638480,2645920,then will be practically useless  if when soldiers have become attached to  you punishments are not enforced they
jxcMRkqaQdw,2645920,2653040,will still be useless  therefore soldiers must be treated in  the first instance with humanity but
jxcMRkqaQdw,2653040,2659839,kept under control by means of iron  discipline  this is a certain road to victory
jxcMRkqaQdw,2659839,2667359,if in training soldiers commands are  habitually enforced the army will be  well disciplined if not its discipline
jxcMRkqaQdw,2667359,2674000,will be bad  if a general shows confidence in his men  but always insists on his orders being
jxcMRkqaQdw,2674000,2678240,obeyed the gain will be mutual
jxcMRkqaQdw,2680880,2687359,chapter 10 terrain  sun tzu said we may distinguish six
jxcMRkqaQdw,2687359,2692400,kinds of terrain to with one accessible  ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,2692400,2698000,two entangling ground  three  temporizing ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,2698000,2703119,four narrow passes  five precipitous heights
jxcMRkqaQdw,2703119,2709920,six positions at a great distance from  the enemy  ground which can be freely traversed by
jxcMRkqaQdw,2709920,2715599,both sides is called accessible  with regard to ground of this nature be
jxcMRkqaQdw,2715599,2721200,before the enemy in occupying the raised  and sunny spots  and carefully guard your line of
jxcMRkqaQdw,2721200,2726400,supplies then you will be able to fight  with advantage
jxcMRkqaQdw,2726480,2732960,ground which can be abandoned but is  hard to reoccupy is called entangling
jxcMRkqaQdw,2732960,2738960,from a position of this sort if the  enemy is unprepared you may sally forth  and defeat him
jxcMRkqaQdw,2738960,2746079,but if the enemy is prepared for your  coming and you fail to defeat him then  return being impossible disasters will
jxcMRkqaQdw,2746079,2752560,ensue  when the position is such that neither  side will gain by making the first move
jxcMRkqaQdw,2752560,2758000,it is called temporizing ground  in a position of this sort even though
jxcMRkqaQdw,2758000,2765200,the enemy should offer us an attractive  bait it will be advisable not to stir  forth but rather to retreat thus
jxcMRkqaQdw,2765200,2770400,enticing the enemy in his turn then when  part of his army has come out we may
jxcMRkqaQdw,2770400,2774760,deliver our attack with advantage
jxcMRkqaQdw,2776000,2783200,with regard to narrow passes if you can  occupy them first let them be strongly  garrisoned and await the advent of the
jxcMRkqaQdw,2783200,2789200,enemy  should the army forestall you in  occupying a pass do not go after him if
jxcMRkqaQdw,2789200,2794480,the pass is fully garrisoned but only if  it is weakly garrisoned
jxcMRkqaQdw,2794480,2801040,with regard to precipitous heights if  you are beforehand with your adversary  you should occupy the raised and sunny
jxcMRkqaQdw,2801040,2806960,spots and there wait for him to come up  if the enemy has occupied them before
jxcMRkqaQdw,2806960,2812000,you do not follow him but retreat and  try to entice him away
jxcMRkqaQdw,2812000,2818560,if you are situated at a great distance  from the enemy and the strength of the  two armies is equal it is not easy to
jxcMRkqaQdw,2818560,2825359,provoke a battle and fighting will be to  your disadvantage  these six other principles connected
jxcMRkqaQdw,2825359,2831920,with earth the general who has attained  a responsible post must be careful to  study them
jxcMRkqaQdw,2831920,2837280,now an army is exposed to six several  calamities not arising from natural
jxcMRkqaQdw,2837280,2843359,causes but from faults for which the  general is responsible  these are
jxcMRkqaQdw,2843359,2849440,one flight  two  insubordination three collapse
jxcMRkqaQdw,2849440,2856160,four  ruin  five disorganization  six route
jxcMRkqaQdw,2856160,2862559,now the conditions are being equal if  one force is hurled against another ten  times its size the result will be the
jxcMRkqaQdw,2862559,2869520,flight of the former  when the common soldiers are too strong  and their officers too weak the result
jxcMRkqaQdw,2869520,2876400,is insubordination  when the officers are too strong and the  common soldiers too weak the result is
jxcMRkqaQdw,2876400,2882960,collapse  when the higher officers are angry and  insubordinate and on meeting the enemy
jxcMRkqaQdw,2882960,2889200,give battle on their own account from a  feeling of resentment before the  commander-in-chief can tell whether or
jxcMRkqaQdw,2889200,2895359,no he is in a position to fight  the result is ruin
jxcMRkqaQdw,2895680,2901440,when the general is weak and without  authority when his orders are not clear  and distinct
jxcMRkqaQdw,2901440,2908240,when there are no fixed duties assigned  to officers and men and the ranks are  formed in a slovenly haphazard manner
jxcMRkqaQdw,2908240,2914800,the result is utter disorganization  when a general unable to estimate the
jxcMRkqaQdw,2914800,2920240,enemy's strength allows an inferior  force to engage a larger one or hurls a
jxcMRkqaQdw,2920240,2926319,weak detachment against a powerful one  and neglects to place picked soldiers in  the front rank
jxcMRkqaQdw,2926319,2932160,the result must be route  there are six ways of courting defeat
jxcMRkqaQdw,2932160,2938079,which must be carefully noted by the  general who has attained a responsible  post
jxcMRkqaQdw,2938079,2945119,the natural formation of the country is  the soldier's best ally but a power of  estimating the adversary of controlling
jxcMRkqaQdw,2945119,2950480,the forces of victory and of shrewdly  calculating difficulties dangers and
jxcMRkqaQdw,2950480,2956559,distances constitutes the test of a  great general  he who knows these things and in
jxcMRkqaQdw,2956559,2964319,fighting puts his knowledge into  practice will win his battles  he who knows them not nor practices them
jxcMRkqaQdw,2964319,2969839,will surely be defeated  if fighting is sure to result in victory
jxcMRkqaQdw,2969839,2976079,then you must fight  even though the ruler forbid it if  fighting will not result in victory then
jxcMRkqaQdw,2976079,2982480,you must not fight even at the ruler's  bidding  the general who advances without
jxcMRkqaQdw,2982480,2989359,coveting fame and retreats without  fearing disgrace whose only thought is  to protect his country and do good
jxcMRkqaQdw,2989359,2994400,service for his sovereign is the jewel  of the kingdom
jxcMRkqaQdw,2994400,2999839,regard your soldiers as your children  and they will follow you into the  deepest valleys
jxcMRkqaQdw,2999839,3006319,look upon them as your own beloved sons  and they will stand by you even unto  death
jxcMRkqaQdw,3006319,3011920,if however you are indulgent but unable  to make your authority felt kind-hearted
jxcMRkqaQdw,3011920,3017040,but unable to enforce your commands  and incapable moreover of quelling
jxcMRkqaQdw,3017040,3025440,disorder then your soldiers must be  likened to spoil children they are  useless for any practical purpose
jxcMRkqaQdw,3025440,3033200,if we know that our own men are in a  condition to attack but are unaware that  the enemy is not open to attack we have
jxcMRkqaQdw,3033200,3038400,gone only halfway towards victory  if we know that the enemy is open to
jxcMRkqaQdw,3038400,3043680,attack but are unaware that our own men  are not in a condition to attack
jxcMRkqaQdw,3043680,3049839,we have only gone halfway towards  victory  if we know that the enemy is open to
jxcMRkqaQdw,3049839,3055119,attack and also know that our men are in  a condition to attack but are unaware
jxcMRkqaQdw,3055119,3063119,that the nature of the ground makes  fighting impractical we have still gone  only halfway towards victory
jxcMRkqaQdw,3063119,3071440,hence the experienced soldier once in  motion is never bewildered once he has  broken camp he is never at a loss
jxcMRkqaQdw,3071440,3077839,hence the saying if you know the enemy  and know yourself your victory will not  stand in doubt
jxcMRkqaQdw,3077839,3083838,if you know heaven and no earth you may  make your victory complete
jxcMRkqaQdw,3086319,3091680,chapter 11  the nine situations
jxcMRkqaQdw,3091680,3097839,sun tzu said the art of war recognizes  nine varieties of ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3097839,3103200,one dispersive ground  two  facile ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3103200,3109119,three  contentious ground  four  open ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3109119,3115200,five ground of intersecting highways  six  serious ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3115200,3121119,seven  difficult ground  eight  hemmed in ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3121119,3126240,nine desperate ground  when a chieftain is fighting in his own
jxcMRkqaQdw,3126240,3131760,territory it is dispersive ground  when he has penetrated into hostile
jxcMRkqaQdw,3131760,3137040,territory but to no great distance it is  facile ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3137040,3144640,ground the possession of which imports  great advantage to either side is  contentious ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3144640,3150640,ground on which each side has liberty of  movement is open ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3150800,3158240,ground which forms the key to three  contiguous states so that he who  occupies it first has most of the empire
jxcMRkqaQdw,3158240,3164800,at his command is a ground of  intersecting highways  when an army has penetrated into the
jxcMRkqaQdw,3164800,3172240,heart of a hostile country leaving a  number of fortified cities in its rear  it is serious ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3172240,3178079,mountain forests rugged steeps marshes  and fence all country that is hard to
jxcMRkqaQdw,3178079,3183760,traverse  this is difficult ground  ground which is reached through narrow
jxcMRkqaQdw,3183760,3189119,gorges and from which we can only retire  by tortuous paths so that a small number
jxcMRkqaQdw,3189119,3195839,of the enemy would suffice to crush a  large body of our men  this is hemmed in ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3195839,3202720,ground on which we can only be saved  from destruction by fighting without  delay is desperate ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3202720,3209599,on dispersive ground therefore fight not  on facile ground halt not on contentious
jxcMRkqaQdw,3209599,3215040,ground attack knot  on open ground do not try to block the
jxcMRkqaQdw,3215040,3221760,enemy's way  on the ground of intersecting highways  join hands with your allies
jxcMRkqaQdw,3221760,3227920,on serious ground gather in plunder in  difficult ground keep steadily on the
jxcMRkqaQdw,3227920,3233280,march  on hemmed in ground resort to stratagen
jxcMRkqaQdw,3233280,3238880,on desperate ground  fight  those who are called skillful leaders of
jxcMRkqaQdw,3238880,3246079,old knew how to drive a wedge between  the enemies front and rear to prevent  cooperation between his large and small
jxcMRkqaQdw,3246079,3251520,divisions to hinder the good troops from  rescuing the bad the officers from
jxcMRkqaQdw,3251520,3256800,rallying their men  when the enemy's men were united they
jxcMRkqaQdw,3256800,3264640,managed to keep them in disorder  when it was to their advantage they made  a forward move when otherwise they stop
jxcMRkqaQdw,3264640,3271040,still  if asked how to cope with a great host  of the enemy in orderly array and on the
jxcMRkqaQdw,3271040,3276720,point of marching to the attack i should  say  begin by seizing something which your
jxcMRkqaQdw,3276720,3282799,opponent holds dear  then he will be amenable to your will
jxcMRkqaQdw,3282799,3290480,rapidity is the essence of war take  advantage of the enemy's unreadiness  make your way by unexpected roots and
jxcMRkqaQdw,3290480,3297200,attack unguarded spots  the following other principles to be  observed by an invading force
jxcMRkqaQdw,3297200,3302799,the further you penetrate into a country  the greater will be the solidarity of  your troops
jxcMRkqaQdw,3302799,3309359,and thus the defenders will not prevail  against you  make forays infertile country in order
jxcMRkqaQdw,3309359,3314559,to supply your army with food  carefully study the well-being of your
jxcMRkqaQdw,3314559,3320079,men and do not overtax them  concentrate your energy and horde your
jxcMRkqaQdw,3320079,3328000,strength  keep your army continually on the move  and devise unfathomable plans
jxcMRkqaQdw,3328000,3335119,throw your soldiers into positions  whence there is no escape and they will  prefer death to flight if they will face
jxcMRkqaQdw,3335119,3340640,death there is nothing they may not  achieve  officers and men alike will put forward
jxcMRkqaQdw,3340640,3345920,their uttermost strength  soldiers when in desperate straits lose
jxcMRkqaQdw,3345920,3351520,the sense of fear if there is no place  of refuge they will stand firm
jxcMRkqaQdw,3351520,3357680,if they are in hostile country they will  show a stubborn front  if there is no help for it they will
jxcMRkqaQdw,3357680,3364720,fight hard  thus without waiting to be marshaled the  soldiers will be constantly on the tv
jxcMRkqaQdw,3364720,3370160,without waiting to be asked they will do  your will without restrictions they will
jxcMRkqaQdw,3370160,3377200,be faithful without giving orders they  can be trusted  prohibit the taking of romans and do
jxcMRkqaQdw,3377200,3383359,away with superstitious doubts then  until death itself comes no calamity
jxcMRkqaQdw,3383359,3389440,need be feared  if our soldiers are not overburdened  with money it is not because they have a
jxcMRkqaQdw,3389440,3394640,distaste for riches  if their lives are not unduly long
jxcMRkqaQdw,3394640,3400319,it is not because they are disinclined  to longevity  on the day they are ordered out to
jxcMRkqaQdw,3400319,3405520,battle your soldiers may weep  those sitting up bedewing their garments
jxcMRkqaQdw,3405520,3412000,and those lying down letting the tears  run down their cheeks  but let them once be brought to bay and
jxcMRkqaQdw,3412000,3418400,they will display the courage of a chew  or a cui  the skillful tactician may be likened to
jxcMRkqaQdw,3418400,3424480,the schweijen now the srijan is a snake  that is found in the jiung mountains
jxcMRkqaQdw,3424480,3431440,strike at its head and you will be  attacked by its tail strike at its tail  and you will be attacked by its head
jxcMRkqaQdw,3431440,3437200,strike at his middle and you will be  attacked by the head and tail both
jxcMRkqaQdw,3437200,3443040,asked if an army can be made to imitate  the schweijen i should answer yes
jxcMRkqaQdw,3443040,3448640,for the men of wu and the men of ue are  enemies yet if they are crossing a river
jxcMRkqaQdw,3448640,3455359,in the same boat and are caught by a  storm they will come to each other's  assistance just as the left hand helps
jxcMRkqaQdw,3455359,3461599,the right  hence it is not enough to put one's  trust in the tethering horses and the
jxcMRkqaQdw,3461599,3467280,burying of chariot wheels in the ground  the principle on which to manage an army
jxcMRkqaQdw,3467280,3472319,is to set up one standard of courage  which all must reach
jxcMRkqaQdw,3472319,3477920,how to make the best of both strong and  weak  that is a question involving the proper
jxcMRkqaQdw,3477920,3484400,use of ground  thus the skillful general conducts his  army just as though he were leading a
jxcMRkqaQdw,3484400,3490720,single man willy-nilly by the hand it is  the business of a general to be quiet
jxcMRkqaQdw,3490720,3496720,and thus ensure secrecy upright and just  and thus maintain order
jxcMRkqaQdw,3496720,3502000,he must be able to mystify his officers  and men by false reports and appearances
jxcMRkqaQdw,3502000,3507440,and thus keep them in total ignorance  by altering his arrangements and
jxcMRkqaQdw,3507440,3514400,changing his plans he keeps the enemy  without definite knowledge  by shifting his camp and taking
jxcMRkqaQdw,3514400,3519760,siquita's roots he prevents the enemy  from anticipating his purpose
jxcMRkqaQdw,3519760,3526720,at the critical moment the leader of an  army acts like one who has climbed up a  height and then kicks away the ladder
jxcMRkqaQdw,3526720,3533440,behind him  he carries his men deep into hostile  territory before he shows his hand
jxcMRkqaQdw,3533440,3539520,he burns his boats and breaks his  cooking pots  like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep
jxcMRkqaQdw,3539520,3545280,he drives his men this way and that and  nothing knows whether he is going
jxcMRkqaQdw,3545280,3551599,to muster his host and bring it into  danger this may be termed the business  of the general
jxcMRkqaQdw,3551599,3559119,the different measures suited to the  nine varieties of ground the expediency  of aggressive or defensive tactics and
jxcMRkqaQdw,3559119,3566000,the fundamental laws of human nature  these are things that must most  certainly be studied
jxcMRkqaQdw,3566000,3571040,when invading hostile territory the  general principle is that penetrating
jxcMRkqaQdw,3571040,3577280,deeply brings cohesion  penetrating but a short way means  dispersion
jxcMRkqaQdw,3577280,3584000,when you leave your own country behind  and take your army across neighborhood  territory you find yourself on critical
jxcMRkqaQdw,3584000,3590400,ground  there are means of communication on all  four sides the ground is one of
jxcMRkqaQdw,3590400,3597440,intersecting highways  when you penetrate deeply into a country  it is serious ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3597440,3604400,when you penetrate but a little way it  is facile ground  when you have your enemy's strongholds
jxcMRkqaQdw,3604400,3609599,on your rear and narrow passes in front  it is hemmed in ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3609599,3614720,when there is no place of refuge at all  it is desperate ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3614720,3620880,therefore on dispersive ground i would  inspire my men with unity of purpose
jxcMRkqaQdw,3620880,3627040,on facile ground i would see that there  is close connection between all parts of  my army
jxcMRkqaQdw,3627040,3633760,on contentious ground i would hurry up  my rear  on open ground i would keep a vigilant
jxcMRkqaQdw,3633760,3641359,eye on my defenses on ground of  intersecting highways i would  consolidate my alliances
jxcMRkqaQdw,3641359,3646559,serious ground i would try to ensure a  continuous stream of supplies
jxcMRkqaQdw,3646559,3653359,on difficult ground i would keep pushing  on along the road  on hemmed in ground i would block any
jxcMRkqaQdw,3653359,3660240,way of retreat  on desperate ground i would proclaim to  my soldiers the hopelessness of saving
jxcMRkqaQdw,3660240,3666319,their lives  for it is the soldier's disposition to  offer an obstinate resistance when
jxcMRkqaQdw,3666319,3671680,surrounded to fight hard when he cannot  help himself and to obey promptly when
jxcMRkqaQdw,3671680,3678240,he has fallen into danger  we cannot enter into alliance with the  neighboring princes until we are
jxcMRkqaQdw,3678240,3684640,acquainted with their designs  we are not fit to lead an army on the  march unless we are familiar with the
jxcMRkqaQdw,3684640,3692559,face of the country  its mountains and forests its pitfalls  and precipices its marshes and swamps
jxcMRkqaQdw,3692559,3699599,we shall be unable to turn natural  advantages to account unless we make use  of local guides
jxcMRkqaQdw,3699599,3707200,to be ignored of any one of the  following four or five principles does  not befit a war-like prince
jxcMRkqaQdw,3707200,3712720,when a warlike prince attacks a powerful  state his generalship shows itself in
jxcMRkqaQdw,3712720,3718960,preventing the concentration of the  enemy's forces  he overalls his opponents and their
jxcMRkqaQdw,3718960,3724319,allies are prevented from joining  against him  hence he does not strive to allow
jxcMRkqaQdw,3724319,3729440,himself with all and sundry nor does he  foster the power of other states
jxcMRkqaQdw,3729440,3734480,he carries out his own secret designs  keeping his antagonists in awe
jxcMRkqaQdw,3734480,3739520,thus he is able to capture their cities  and overthrow their kingdoms
jxcMRkqaQdw,3739520,3745200,bestow rewards without regard to rule  issue orders without regard to previous
jxcMRkqaQdw,3745200,3752559,arrangements and you will be able to  handle a whole army as though you had to  do it with but a single man
jxcMRkqaQdw,3752559,3759520,confront your soldiers with the deed  itself  never let them know your design  when the outlook is bright bring it
jxcMRkqaQdw,3759520,3764720,before their eyes but tell them nothing  when the situation is gloomy
jxcMRkqaQdw,3764720,3771440,place your army in deadly peril and it  will survive  plunge it into desperate straits and it
jxcMRkqaQdw,3771440,3777920,will come off in safety  for it is precisely when a force has  fallen into harm's way that it is
jxcMRkqaQdw,3777920,3783359,capable of striking a blow for victory  success in warfare is gained by
jxcMRkqaQdw,3783359,3789200,carefully accommodating ourselves to the  enemy's purpose  by persistently hanging on to the
jxcMRkqaQdw,3789200,3795119,enemy's flank we shall succeed in the  long run in killing the  commander-in-chief
jxcMRkqaQdw,3795119,3802160,this is called ability to accomplish a  thing by sheer cunning  on the day that you take up your command
jxcMRkqaQdw,3802160,3807520,block the frontier passes destroy the  official tallies and stop the passage of
jxcMRkqaQdw,3807520,3814799,all emissaries  stone in the council chamber so that you  may control the situation
jxcMRkqaQdw,3814799,3821680,if the enemy leaves the door open you  must rush in  for stall your opponent by seizing what
jxcMRkqaQdw,3821680,3827440,he holds dear and subtly contrived to  time his arrival on the ground
jxcMRkqaQdw,3827440,3834960,walk in the path defined by rule and  accommodate yourselves to the enemy  until you can fight a decisive battle
jxcMRkqaQdw,3834960,3840960,at first then exhibit the coinness of a  maiden until the enemy gives you an  opening
jxcMRkqaQdw,3840960,3849960,afterwards emulate the rapidity of a  running hair and it will be too late for  the enemy to oppose you
jxcMRkqaQdw,3852000,3859280,chapter 12  the attack by fire  sun tzu said there are five ways of
jxcMRkqaQdw,3859280,3864480,attacking with fire  the first is to burn the soldiers in  their camp
jxcMRkqaQdw,3864480,3870400,the second is to burn stalls  the third is to burn baggage trains the
jxcMRkqaQdw,3870400,3876640,fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines  the fifth is to hurl dropping fire
jxcMRkqaQdw,3876640,3883359,amongst the enemy  in order to carry out an attack we must  have means available
jxcMRkqaQdw,3883359,3888640,the material for raising fire should  always be kept in readiness
jxcMRkqaQdw,3888640,3895920,there is a proper season for making  attacks with fire and special days for  starting a conflagration
jxcMRkqaQdw,3895920,3902319,the proper season is when the weather is  very dry  the special days are those when the moon
jxcMRkqaQdw,3902319,3908400,is in the constellations of the sieve  the wall the wing or the crossbar for
jxcMRkqaQdw,3908400,3914799,these four are all days of rising wind  in attacking with fire one should be
jxcMRkqaQdw,3914799,3920559,prepared to meet five possible  developments  when fire breaks out inside the enemy's
jxcMRkqaQdw,3920559,3926640,camp respond at once with an attack for  without  if there is an outbreak of fire but the
jxcMRkqaQdw,3926640,3931920,enemy's soldiers remain quiet bide your  time and do not attack
jxcMRkqaQdw,3931920,3939599,when the force of the flames has reached  its height follow up with an attack if  that is practicable if not stay where
jxcMRkqaQdw,3939599,3945440,you are  if it is possible to make an assault  with fire from without do not wait for
jxcMRkqaQdw,3945440,3950559,it to break out within but deliver your  attack at a favorable moment
jxcMRkqaQdw,3950559,3956160,when you start a fire beat a windward of  it do not attack from the leeward
jxcMRkqaQdw,3956160,3962799,a wind that rises in the daytime lasts  long but the night breeze soon falls
jxcMRkqaQdw,3962799,3970160,in every army the five developments  connected with fire must be known the  movements of the stars calculated and a
jxcMRkqaQdw,3970160,3975520,watch kept for the proper days  hence those who use fire as an aid to
jxcMRkqaQdw,3975520,3981680,the attack show intelligence those who  use water as an aid to the attack gain
jxcMRkqaQdw,3981680,3988880,an accession of strength  by means of water an enemy may be  intercepted but not robbed of all his
jxcMRkqaQdw,3988880,3995200,belongings  unhappy is the fate of one who tries to  win his battles and succeed in his
jxcMRkqaQdw,3995200,4001440,attacks without cultivating the spirit  of enterprise  for the result is a waste of time and
jxcMRkqaQdw,4001440,4006720,general stagnation  hence the same the enlightened ruler
jxcMRkqaQdw,4006720,4012480,lays his plans well the good general  cultivates his resources
jxcMRkqaQdw,4012480,4019280,move not until you see an advantage use  not your troops unless there is  something to be gained
jxcMRkqaQdw,4019280,4025520,fight not unless the position is  critical  no ruler should put troops into the
jxcMRkqaQdw,4025520,4031520,field merely to gratify his own spleen  no general should fight a battle simply
jxcMRkqaQdw,4031520,4036720,out of peak  if it is to your advantage make a  forward move
jxcMRkqaQdw,4036720,4042640,if not stay where you are  anger may in time change to gladness
jxcMRkqaQdw,4042640,4048559,vexation may be succeeded by content  but a kingdom that has once been  destroyed
jxcMRkqaQdw,4048559,4053760,can never come back again into being nor  can the dead ever be brought back to
jxcMRkqaQdw,4053760,4060559,life  hence the enlightened ruler is heedful  and the good general full of caution
jxcMRkqaQdw,4060559,4066558,this is the way to keep a country at  peace and an army intact
jxcMRkqaQdw,4067599,4075039,chapter 13 the use of spies  sun tzu said
jxcMRkqaQdw,4075039,4082240,raising a host of a hundred thousand men  and marching them great distances  entails heavy loss on the people and a
jxcMRkqaQdw,4082240,4088079,drain on the resources of the state  the daily expenditure will amount to a
jxcMRkqaQdw,4088079,4093280,thousand ounces of silver there will be  commotion at home and abroad and men
jxcMRkqaQdw,4093280,4098318,will drop down exhausted on the highways  as many as seven hundred thousand
jxcMRkqaQdw,4098318,4104318,families will be impeded in their labor  hostile armies may face each other for
jxcMRkqaQdw,4104318,4111758,years striving for the victory which is  decided in a single day  this being so to remain in ignorance of
jxcMRkqaQdw,4111758,4116798,the enemy's condition simply because one  grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces
jxcMRkqaQdw,4116798,4122560,of silver in honors and emoluments is  the height of inhumanity
jxcMRkqaQdw,4122560,4128080,one who acts thus is no leader of men  no present help to his sovereign no
jxcMRkqaQdw,4128080,4135520,master of victory  thus what enables the wise sovereign and  the good general to strike and conquer
jxcMRkqaQdw,4135520,4140960,and achieve things beyond the reach of  ordinary men is for knowledge
jxcMRkqaQdw,4140960,4148640,now this foreknowledge cannot be  elicited from spirits it cannot be  obtained inductively from experience nor
jxcMRkqaQdw,4148640,4154480,by any deductive calculation  knowledge of the enemy's dispositions
jxcMRkqaQdw,4154480,4160719,can only be obtained from other men  hence the use of spies of whom there are
jxcMRkqaQdw,4160719,4168080,five classes  one local spies  two inward spies
jxcMRkqaQdw,4168080,4174080,three converted spies  four  doomed spies
jxcMRkqaQdw,4174080,4180080,five surviving spies  when these five kinds of spy are all at
jxcMRkqaQdw,4180080,4186159,work none can discover the secret system  this is called divine manipulation of
jxcMRkqaQdw,4186159,4193838,the threads  it is the sovereign's most precious  faculty  having local spies means employing the
jxcMRkqaQdw,4193838,4199679,services of the inhabitants of a  district  having inward spies making use of
jxcMRkqaQdw,4199679,4205040,officials of the enemy  having converted spies getting hold of
jxcMRkqaQdw,4205040,4210239,the enemy's spies and using them for our  own purposes
jxcMRkqaQdw,4210239,4215600,having doomed spies doing certain things  openly for purposes of deception and
jxcMRkqaQdw,4215600,4220880,allowing our spies to know of them and  report them to the enemy
jxcMRkqaQdw,4220880,4227520,surviving spies finally are those who  bring back news from the enemy's camp
jxcMRkqaQdw,4227520,4232640,hence it is that which none in the whole  army are more intimate relations to be
jxcMRkqaQdw,4232640,4238159,maintained than with spies  none should be more liberally rewarded
jxcMRkqaQdw,4238159,4245199,in no other business should greater  secrecy be preserved  spies cannot be usefully employed
jxcMRkqaQdw,4245199,4251199,without a certain intuitive sagacity  they cannot be properly managed without
jxcMRkqaQdw,4251199,4257280,benevolence and straightforwardness  without subtle ingenuity of mind one
jxcMRkqaQdw,4257280,4263920,cannot make certain of the truth of  their reports  be subtle be subtle and use your spies
jxcMRkqaQdw,4263920,4269520,for every kind of business  if a secret piece of news is divulged by
jxcMRkqaQdw,4269520,4274880,a spy before the time is ripe he must be  put to death together with the man to
jxcMRkqaQdw,4274880,4280400,whom the secret was told  whether the object be to crush an army
jxcMRkqaQdw,4280400,4285440,to storm a city or to assassinate an  individual it is always necessary to
jxcMRkqaQdw,4285440,4290640,begin by finding out the names of the  attendants the aids decamp and
jxcMRkqaQdw,4290640,4297120,doorkeepers and centers of the general  in command  our spies must be commissioned to
jxcMRkqaQdw,4297120,4304480,ascertain these  the enemy spies who have come to spy on  us must be sought out tempted with
jxcMRkqaQdw,4304480,4311840,bribes led away and comfortably housed  thus they will become converted spies
jxcMRkqaQdw,4311840,4317440,and available for our service  it is through the information brought by
jxcMRkqaQdw,4317440,4322719,the converted spy that we are able to  acquire and employ local and inward
jxcMRkqaQdw,4322719,4329360,spies  it is owing to his information again  that we can cause the doomed spy to
jxcMRkqaQdw,4329360,4335840,carry false tidings to the enemy  lastly it is by his information that the
jxcMRkqaQdw,4335840,4342960,surviving spy can be used on appointed  occasions  the end and aim of spying in all his
jxcMRkqaQdw,4342960,4348560,five varieties is knowledge of the enemy  and this knowledge can only be derived
jxcMRkqaQdw,4348560,4354560,in the first instance  from the converted spy  hence it is essential that the converted
jxcMRkqaQdw,4354560,4361920,spy be treated with the utmost  liberality  of old the rise of the yin dynasty was
jxcMRkqaQdw,4361920,4367440,due to ai chi who had served under the  hisya likewise the rise of the cho
jxcMRkqaQdw,4367440,4372560,dynasty was due to luya who had served  under the yin
jxcMRkqaQdw,4372560,4379520,hence it is only the enlightened ruler  and the wise general who will use the  highest intelligence of the army for
jxcMRkqaQdw,4379520,4384800,purposes of spying and thereby they  achieve great results
jxcMRkqaQdw,4384800,4390560,spies are a most important element in  water because on them depends an army's
jxcMRkqaQdw,4390560,4394440,ability to move
jxcMRkqaQdw,4404960,4407040,you
