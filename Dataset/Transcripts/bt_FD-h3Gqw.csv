bt_FD-h3Gqw,80,5839,hey art friends happy new year we're  back yeah and we're super excited we  missed you guys a lot and we hope you
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5839,12880,had an amazing holiday and we're really  excited because we have a ton of art  planned for this new year 2022 yeah i
bt_FD-h3Gqw,12880,18160,can't believe it's 2022. i know right  feels like we're in the future
bt_FD-h3Gqw,18160,24640,because we are  to kick off the new year we made this  playlist of our top 10 art lessons from
bt_FD-h3Gqw,24640,31039,2021 yeah there are most watched videos  from last year yeah it starts with 10  and then goes all the way up to our most
bt_FD-h3Gqw,31039,38320,watched video at the very end yes so we  hope you have your drawing supplies  ready and we'll see you later our  friends goodbye hey our friends today
bt_FD-h3Gqw,38320,44559,we're really excited because we're going  to draw another pokemon who are we  drawing charmeleon yeah charmeleon and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,44559,50719,we've already drawn charizard and  charmander charmander yeah so be sure to  check those out too you need your art
bt_FD-h3Gqw,50719,56320,supplies we're going to use a pencil and  a marker you also need some paper and  something to color with yeah you're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,56320,62239,ready to start yes we're going to use  our pencil first this is so we can draw  the guide shapes and also guidelines to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,62239,68479,get the general shape of charmeleon now  let's first draw a circle for his head
bt_FD-h3Gqw,68479,74560,i'm going to jar up here towards the top  of our paper and a little bit to the  left on the left side i'm going to draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,74560,79600,it about this size  oh maybe a little bit bigger that's the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,79600,85360,great part about using a pencil first  you can  get it just right before you move on to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,85360,90960,the next step  i press really hard so that it would  show up on the camera but you can press
bt_FD-h3Gqw,90960,98159,lighter at home so that it's easier to  erase the guidelines when we're all done  you can also go back over it if you want
bt_FD-h3Gqw,98159,104720,to make it bigger or smaller you can  also move it look at this i'm going to  make it a little bit bigger go back over
bt_FD-h3Gqw,104720,110720,it  and then if you make any changes you can  use your eraser and erase the other
bt_FD-h3Gqw,110720,116560,guidelines that you're not going to use  anymore so i made this a little bigger  so i'm erasing the smaller
bt_FD-h3Gqw,116560,123200,circle  now let's draw the guidelines for the  body for charmeleon we're going to start
bt_FD-h3Gqw,123200,128239,here we're going to draw his neck the  start or the front of his neck we're  going to draw it right in the center of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,128239,134720,the circle so we can also even put a  little guide point right here in the  middle at the bottom of our circle and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,134720,140879,we're going to draw a curve this this is  for his belly we're going to curve down  like this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,140879,147760,and we're going to curve around and  we're going to come past his head and  then curve up for the for the tail so
bt_FD-h3Gqw,147760,153200,look at this right here if you draw a  line straight down from the circle i  think i went out too far
bt_FD-h3Gqw,153200,158959,so if i draw a line straight down from  the circle i'm going to draw his belly  not sticking out as far
bt_FD-h3Gqw,158959,166400,so i'm going to draw another guideline  right over  the first one i did and bring it in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,166400,171680,so it doesn't stick out past  his head yeah he doesn't have that big  of a belly
bt_FD-h3Gqw,171680,177280,so now i'm going to erase the other  guideline because i don't want it i  don't want to use that one anymore i'm
bt_FD-h3Gqw,177280,182840,going to use the smaller one kind of  looks like a balloon with a wiggly
bt_FD-h3Gqw,182840,189840,string i don't know what i was saying  the balloon's like flying away yeah and  the strings like
bt_FD-h3Gqw,189840,195599,yeah  next we're going to draw the guideline  for the back of charmeleon so we'll
bt_FD-h3Gqw,195599,201599,start here so i'm going to leave a  little space and we're going to draw a  line i'm going to draw kind of an s line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,201599,208319,i'm going to curve in like this  and then we're going to curve out just a  little bit and we're going to go past
bt_FD-h3Gqw,208319,214080,the tail line so i'm going to come down  about that far past the tail  so it comes in a little bit and then it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,214080,219519,comes out so he has a really strong body  and the general shape of his body looks
bt_FD-h3Gqw,219519,225280,a little bit like a pear yeah bigger at  the bottom and then smaller at the top
bt_FD-h3Gqw,225280,231920,i like that you made it come out a  little further yeah  i just wanted to make it a little wider  yeah that's perfect that's the great
bt_FD-h3Gqw,231920,238239,part about the pencil yes okay now we've  got just three more guidelines that  we're gonna use so up here at the top
bt_FD-h3Gqw,238239,245200,i'm gonna turn my paper sideways  sometimes that helps we're going to  split our top the head circle up here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,245200,250560,we're going to split it in half so i'm  going to draw a line just use your eyes  to measure
bt_FD-h3Gqw,250560,255680,and split that circle right in half then  we're going to also draw a guideline for
bt_FD-h3Gqw,255680,261840,the top of his shoulders so i'm going to  leave a little space so that he has room  for his neck and then this is this will
bt_FD-h3Gqw,261840,267199,be the top of his shoulders and we go  through the whole body  and then we're also going to draw about
bt_FD-h3Gqw,267199,272639,half we're going to measure this shape  and right about in half that's where his
bt_FD-h3Gqw,272639,278080,legs are going to start i might go a  little lower so i'm going to draw  another line that goes straight across
bt_FD-h3Gqw,278080,284960,like that go over it a couple times to  make it darker for our friends one thing  i noticed on this line on your drawing
bt_FD-h3Gqw,284960,290720,it's tipped just a little bit like this  and you could tip it the other way that  way his legs
bt_FD-h3Gqw,290720,296560,are the same height  yeah there you go we're done with our  pencil let's put that off to the side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,296560,302960,and we're going to switch to our markers  we're going to use this on top of all of  the pencil guidelines well let's first
bt_FD-h3Gqw,302960,309280,start on his head and we're going to  start with the eyes specifically so  right here we're going to come in see
bt_FD-h3Gqw,309280,316400,this line and that splits our circle  we're going to come in just a little bit  and add a little point
bt_FD-h3Gqw,317120,323360,okay now we're going to draw a diagonal  line that comes up and touches the  circle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,323440,329280,and then we're going to draw a diagonal  line coming down and it's going to go  past the end of the circle and come
bt_FD-h3Gqw,329280,335440,outside of the circle this is for his  nose  and then right here inside of this v
bt_FD-h3Gqw,335440,341039,shape we're going to draw his eye we're  just going to draw a little curve like  that
bt_FD-h3Gqw,341039,347600,now let's draw his other eye we're going  to leave a little space right here for  his nose and we're going to draw a point
bt_FD-h3Gqw,347600,353120,right about there on that line  then we're going to draw a diagonal line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,353120,358400,going up and we're going to go all the  way up see look at this we could draw an  imaginary line we're going to draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,358400,366400,another diagonal line that comes up and  it matches  the height  of this line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,366400,372080,then we're going to draw a straight line  that comes across the guideline like  this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,372080,378080,i'm going to even draw this just a  little bit higher on the top there we go
bt_FD-h3Gqw,378479,385039,yeah now we can draw the outside of  charmander's nope charmeleons
bt_FD-h3Gqw,385680,390960,we're going to draw the end of term  millions i like that curve coming down  and connecting
bt_FD-h3Gqw,390960,396560,okay now let's draw the inside of his  eye we're going to draw another curve  coming down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,396560,402240,and then inside let's draw a little u  shape  like that and we can also color that u
bt_FD-h3Gqw,402240,409280,shape in that's his pupil  let's come over here and we'll just  color this whole thing in because you  can only see part of it so that's his
bt_FD-h3Gqw,409280,414319,pupil there we go now let's draw the top  of his head or his forehead we're going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,414319,420840,to draw a little bump  for  the eyebrow shape and then we're going  to come in and then touch the circle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,420840,427280,again so it comes in and then come back  out touch the circle  then we're going to draw the top of his
bt_FD-h3Gqw,427280,432479,head we're going to come in  just a little  and then we're going to go way outside
bt_FD-h3Gqw,432479,438720,of the circle for the end of he's got  this really cool horn on the top of his  head
bt_FD-h3Gqw,439520,448080,then we're going to curve around for the  top of that horn  and then we're going to come back and  touch the circle and then stop
bt_FD-h3Gqw,448080,453759,isn't that cool yeah i love how this  circle is helping us make the shape then  we're going to start at the horn and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,453759,460000,we're going to draw a diagonal line that  comes down  and then come back out and touch right  where the half
bt_FD-h3Gqw,460000,465360,the line that divides the circle in half  yeah  then let's come back in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,465360,473520,and we're going to stop  where the neck is  yes good job keep going you did it now
bt_FD-h3Gqw,473520,478720,we're going to draw the front of his  nose we're going to draw a curve that  comes down like this and we're going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,478720,485120,stay outside of the circle  then we're going to come back in with a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,485120,490240,short diagonal line  for the top of his mouth
bt_FD-h3Gqw,491199,497680,and then we're going to draw a line  that's straight across look at that it  matches the bottom of his eye
bt_FD-h3Gqw,497680,503360,and i'm going to stop  just under his eye see how if you drew a  line straight underneath his eye that's
bt_FD-h3Gqw,503360,509199,where we're going to draw a little curl  that comes up for the last part of his  mouth yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,509199,514880,now we're going to draw the bottom of  his jaw we're going to draw right on the  guideline the circle we're going to come
bt_FD-h3Gqw,514880,520719,down and trace the circle  and then we're gonna draw his jaw we're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,520719,524479,gonna draw a diagonal line coming up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,525920,531200,nice we did it we drew his head oh let's  add a couple more lines just right here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,531200,537600,he has a little muscle for his eyebrow  we'll draw a curve there and we're going  to draw a curve the same curve on the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,537600,542880,other side  now we did it  let's draw his body next we're going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,542880,549440,start here and we're going to draw his  neck so we'll start in on his chin we're  going to come down right to the shoulder
bt_FD-h3Gqw,549440,555760,line that's this line come the guideline  that's coming across  then we're going to do the same thing on
bt_FD-h3Gqw,555760,560959,the other side we'll draw a curve and  stop at the shoulder line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,560959,567680,nice job  now let's draw his arms we're going to  start by drawing a little bump that
bt_FD-h3Gqw,567680,574320,comes out for his shoulder on the left  and we're going to draw that same little  bump come out and then down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,574320,581279,for the right shoulder yeah now let's  draw the left arm first so we're gonna  come out like this to his elbow we're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,581279,586880,just gonna come really  actually i probably came too far but  that's okay and then we're gonna
bt_FD-h3Gqw,586880,592480,that's okay we're gonna curve down draw  another diagonal line coming down  further
bt_FD-h3Gqw,592480,598720,now we're going to come back up to his  armpit we're going to draw a little  point we'll leave a little space right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,598720,604959,here and then a point that's on the  guideline his belly line  now we're going to draw the diagonal
bt_FD-h3Gqw,604959,611360,line coming out for the other side of  his arm  and then watch this line this line is
bt_FD-h3Gqw,611360,618480,going to be a little trickier we're  going to draw another diagonal line but  towards the bottom it gets further away
bt_FD-h3Gqw,618480,624079,yeah now right here at the end let's  draw a little curve coming in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,624079,631240,and we're going to draw the letter v for  his first claw on his thumb
bt_FD-h3Gqw,633440,639839,and at the top of the v let's draw a  curve  to end the the talon or his claw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,639839,644959,okay now let's draw a short little line  behind or next to the claw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,644959,650000,and we're going to draw another v  this one's a little different we're  going to draw a line that comes down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,650000,658720,like this  straight down  and it comes past the thumb and we're  going to curve back up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,659200,665760,nice job and then we'll draw that  curve to complete the claw at the top  now we're going to do one more letter v
bt_FD-h3Gqw,665760,671120,right here at the end we're going to  touch on the claw  draw a letter v it comes up and then we
bt_FD-h3Gqw,671120,678320,can connect it back in to the other side  of the arm  and then let's draw another curve to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,678320,683920,complete the claw  we did it now let's jump over here and  we're going to draw his other arm we're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,683920,689920,just going to repeat all of the same  steps we might change it a little bit  since his arm is on this side so we'll
bt_FD-h3Gqw,689920,696079,draw the  top of the arm we're going to come out  and then bend down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,696079,701440,so these lines should look close to  about the same height on our drawing so
bt_FD-h3Gqw,701440,706800,now let's draw the other side of his arm  just like we did over here so we're  going to start where his armpit would be
bt_FD-h3Gqw,706800,712079,this time i'm going to draw inside of  his inside of the body we're going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,712079,717120,draw the inside arm we'll stop  there and then we're going to do the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,717120,723279,same thing this line is going to come  down but it's further away down here  than it is up here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,723279,728880,yeah all right let's repeat those same  steps first we're going to draw a little  curve coming in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,728880,734160,we're going to draw the thumb claw so  i'm going to draw the letter v
bt_FD-h3Gqw,734320,742160,and then we'll draw a curve at the top  of the letter v to complete the talon  then we'll draw a short line in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,742160,749440,we'll draw a letter v this time i'm  going to draw a straight line or a curve  kind of going this way and then we'll  curve back
bt_FD-h3Gqw,749760,755920,and then we can draw the top of the clot  and then let's do one more talon
bt_FD-h3Gqw,755920,763600,draw another letter v and connect it to  the outside of the arm  and then draw the top of the talon
bt_FD-h3Gqw,763600,769440,and we did it good job that looks  awesome yeah both of our drawings are  turning out really cool and i love that
bt_FD-h3Gqw,769440,774639,they're not exactly the same and it's  okay if their drawings are a little  different too because the most important
bt_FD-h3Gqw,774639,780639,thing is to have fun yeah and to  practice practice remember to practice  all right let's keep going okay now
bt_FD-h3Gqw,780639,788160,we're ready to draw his belly but we're  gonna add a guide point down here at the  bottom so this is the side of one of his
bt_FD-h3Gqw,788160,794800,legs we're going to come in and add a  guide point maybe right about there so  it's kind of thick
bt_FD-h3Gqw,794800,801040,he has really strong legs now we're  going to draw his belly we're going to  start above the arm line on the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,801040,806880,guideline and we're going to just trace  on top of that pencil line  and then stop
bt_FD-h3Gqw,806880,810160,down here at that point
bt_FD-h3Gqw,813839,820320,yeah  good job now we're going to draw his  back we're going to start underneath on  his armpit right here and we're going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,820320,827120,trace over the pencil line but this time  we're going to stop at  this line the guideline right here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,827120,833279,and then we're gonna  come out for a strong leg we're gonna  come out and then right where the tail
bt_FD-h3Gqw,833279,837120,crosses over we're gonna come back in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,839760,846160,good and then we're gonna draw the rest  of the line coming down and matching the  guideline
bt_FD-h3Gqw,846160,852000,yeah now let's draw his foot and the  rest of his leg so down here at the  bottom it's kind of like what we did on
bt_FD-h3Gqw,852000,857600,his on his thumb or on his hand we're  going to draw a short line coming in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,857600,864399,and we're going to draw the letter v for  its first talon we're going to come down  and back up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,864720,872399,and this time instead of a curve like we  did up here let's draw a smaller upside  down v for the top of his talon or claw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,872399,879519,then let's draw the little bit of skin  in between his talons  and then we'll draw another letter v
bt_FD-h3Gqw,879519,884560,for his other claw  then we can draw another upside down v
bt_FD-h3Gqw,884560,891120,for the top of his claw  and then we're going to draw a little  more of his foot
bt_FD-h3Gqw,891120,899320,this time when we draw the letter v  let's come out to the side  and then we'll curve back up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,899760,906880,yeah and then we can draw a line i mean  down to connect the end of the talon now  we're ready to draw the rest of his leg
bt_FD-h3Gqw,906880,913760,right here on the top of the talon we'll  draw a little curve coming in for the  top of his foot
bt_FD-h3Gqw,913760,920560,then we're going to curve back out and  we're going to touch  that point on the belly line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,920560,925600,and then we're going to curve back up  like this  towards the top
bt_FD-h3Gqw,925600,931600,of his leg  and we're going to stop right about  there  he's got that really strong leg next
bt_FD-h3Gqw,931600,937279,we're ready to draw his other leg now  it's pointed the other direction so  we're not going to use the same steps
bt_FD-h3Gqw,937279,944240,they'll be slightly different but we're  going to start in the same spot so see  this pencil line comes across that's
bt_FD-h3Gqw,944240,950480,where we're going to start his leg and  we're going to come down  like this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,951920,956800,and then we're going to curve back  in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,957519,963600,we want to make sure that this line is  about the same length of where his foot  is over here now let's draw the claws on
bt_FD-h3Gqw,963600,969839,this foot we're going to draw a sideways  v coming out and then back in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,972639,979440,let's draw another one right next to it  i'm going to draw another  sideways v like that
bt_FD-h3Gqw,979920,985360,almost looks like a sideways w and we  can connect the top or the end of those
bt_FD-h3Gqw,985360,990959,talons  oh let's draw one more talon just so  that we have three on this side we have
bt_FD-h3Gqw,990959,997040,three on this side let's drop behind the  first one  now we're going to draw the other side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,997040,1004160,of his leg let's leave a little space on  his belly and we're going to draw a  curve coming towards
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1004160,1009680,his knee  or a diagonal line towards his knee and  then we're going to curve down and this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1009680,1015680,is going to be higher than his talons  this is where his heel is and then we're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1015680,1022800,going to curve back into the bottom of  the talon  we did it jack we finished his body his
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1022800,1029760,legs and also his arms what do we need  to still draw his tail yeah we do but  let's switch back to our pencil this is
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1029760,1034798,the cool part two we can change his tail  see how close it is to his arm i thought
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1034798,1041120,it would be cooler if we moved it away  from his arm so i'm going to start here  on his belly i'm going to draw a new
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1041120,1046558,line that comes out further  like that
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1046558,1052360,i'll draw it a little bit darker so that  our friends at home can see
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1052799,1057679,yeah then let's erase the first line we  drew
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1058720,1065039,now let's draw the other side of his  tail with our pencil so we can use it as  a guideline we're going to leave we're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1065039,1071919,going to draw a curve like this but  right here at the end we're going to  leave just a little gap
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1072080,1077280,the end of his tail is on fire yeah  it's my favorite part
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1077280,1083440,so we've got that tail shape in there it  comes off of his leg curves up just like  the bottom part and we leave that little
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1083440,1089200,space here now let's draw  we're going to draw the letter u at the  end of his tail
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1089200,1095440,we're going to draw guidelines for the  fire now let's turn this u-shape into
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1095440,1100559,kind of looks like a raindrop so i'm  going to curve the right side  go back over it to make it a little
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1100559,1106320,darker  and then we're going to draw the other  side of the fire coming down this side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1106320,1112159,is more of an s curve see how it curves  one way and then back the other way
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1112720,1119280,yeah that looks really cool now if you  wanted to you could make the base of the  raindrop a little bit wider okay i'm
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1119280,1124559,gonna do that too i'm gonna erase this  extra guideline on this side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1124559,1130640,and make this a little wider i'm going  to come out further and then curve back  in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1131280,1138799,let's switch back to our marker we have  our guidelines all finished well let's  first draw over the pencil line for the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1138799,1144960,tail so i'm going to draw the top part  first we'll just trace over the  guideline
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1145120,1151480,then do the same thing for the bottom of  the tail or the other side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1154960,1162320,now the fire is going to be really cool  let's start at the top i'm going to draw  a line coming down on the left side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1163200,1168400,then let's draw  some fire coming out of the raindrop  shape
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1168400,1174000,so i drew a w  then i'm going to curve back into the  fire like this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1174000,1180480,curve down  and connect to the tail  now on the right side let's add more
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1180480,1187440,flames we're going to draw a line that  comes down on top of the guideline  then we'll add a little zigzag
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1187440,1194320,come down further  i'm going to add another zigzag come  down even further and then one more
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1194320,1199360,zigzag coming out and then connect down  to the bottom
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1200240,1207120,jack we did it we finished drawing  charmeleon he looks really cool we're  done with our markers but before we
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1207120,1213679,color it let's use our eraser and go  back over our drawing and erase all of  the extra guidelines that you can still
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1213679,1219280,see  we're not completely done yeah we still
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1219280,1225280,we still have a major part of our  drawing left we got to draw his belly so  let's start here we're going to draw a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1225280,1231200,big upside down u we're going to start  on his armpit we're going to draw an  upside down u comes up like this and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1231200,1237280,then we're going to curve down  and stop right next to his leg the top  of his leg
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1237280,1242320,that's kind of an important detail we  almost left off
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1242880,1248720,you got it  good job jack you did it okay now we're  gonna imagine that line going underneath
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1248720,1256320,his leg and we're gonna come out over  here and watch this we're gonna start  far away from the bottom of his tail but
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1256320,1264480,as we curve  up to the end of his tail we're gonna  connect to the outside
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1264480,1271039,then what's the last thing we're missing  his nostril yeah we can't forget that  we're gonna put it right about
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1271039,1277039,there  now we're done drawing charmeleon we  still need to color it now this part
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1277039,1283039,we're gonna fast forward again but at  the end remember you can pause the video  to match our same coloring you ready to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1283039,1286679,fast forward yes
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1291570,1300080,[Music]
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1300080,1305600,give me five we did it we finished  coloring and drawing charmeleon he looks
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1305600,1312480,so much better at colored in yeah he  does yeah i hope you guys at home will  pause the video and use our drawings as
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1312480,1319600,inspiration to color your drawings now  you could just color them all red but we  colored and added shading to make them
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1319600,1326080,look more 3d we also used our what are  these markers called biannual markers  yeah but you could use whatever you have
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1326080,1333679,at home if you have the same set the  colors that we use are r105  that's the main color for charmeleon and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1333679,1340080,then r107 we used for shading but we  also used our brown color y529 to make
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1340080,1345280,the shadows look a little darker for the  belly we use y900 that's the light tan
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1345280,1350960,color and then for the eyes we use blue  and also a light blue for shading on the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1350960,1356320,talons we hope you had a lot of fun  drawing charmeleon we do we hope you had  a lot of fun and we'll see you later our

bt_FD-h3Gqw,1387520,1394720,and i'm gonna color it in  now any time that we fast forward the  video or if we go too fast what can our
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1394720,1403600,friends do pause the video yeah you can  pause the video all right do you want to  draw a circle and color it in yeah

bt_FD-h3Gqw,1410159,1415679,you have fun into practice yes and to  practice  okay let's fast forward this video
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1415679,1421360,because it might take you a little while  to color in that big circle yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1421360,1427520,you did it no i'm i want to make my  little  head bigger too because
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1427520,1433840,i like how big your head is on your  ladybug okay i made mine a little bigger  now we're ready to switch to our next
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1433840,1439919,color we're going to use pink yeah the  first step we're going to start at the  bottom of the circle and we're going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1439919,1446080,draw a line that comes across over here  do you want to start here and draw a  line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1446080,1451919,yeah  now we're going to draw the top of our  ladybug's body we're going to draw a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1451919,1457679,curve that comes up  and back down  so you start right here draw a curve
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1457679,1463279,that comes up and down  there you go oh that's a really cute
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1463279,1469760,ladybug now we're going to color in the  body and i have another pink crayon for  you do you want to color while i color
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1469760,1475760,too yeah this part we're going gonna  fast forward again so remember to pause  the video
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1476640,1482559,we finished coloring our ladybug's body  now usually a ladybug's body is red but
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1482559,1489039,we colored it pink because this is a  different one this is a valentine's bug  okay now we're going to draw the spots
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1489039,1494720,on a ladybug but we're going to draw red  hearts for spots on our ladybug now
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1494720,1501919,hearts are a little tricky so if you  want to you could just draw a circle for  a spot i'm going to use this white piece
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1501919,1508720,of paper to show you the steps for a  heart a really simple heart first we're  going to draw a v now i'm just going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1508720,1518080,show you first olivia and then we'll do  it on our ladybug so that's the bottom  of our heart then we can draw a curved m
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1518080,1524880,with two bumps two curved m's for the  top of the heart so a little v for the  bottom and then a curve for the two
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1524880,1530960,curves for the top of the heart okay  let's put that off to the side then  we're going to use those steps to draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1530960,1536960,our first ladybug heart we're going to  draw oh let's draw a big one right in  the middle of the body hopefully this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1536960,1544159,shows up on the camera we're going to  draw the letter v  right in the middle  yep and then you could do the you did it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1544159,1551440,the two little bumps on the top i'm  gonna add those two bumps also to  complete my heart and then let's color
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1551440,1558240,in that heart so it's solid red  there's our first ladybug spot you want
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1558240,1563840,to call yours in yeah  if that's a little too tricky remember  you could just draw a circle for a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1563840,1569039,little spot now let's add more hearts  i'm going to draw a smaller one right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1569039,1574320,here you could draw a small one right  here and we do the v and then two bumps  on top
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1574320,1580080,you did it then let's color that one in  too i'm going to add  a couple more
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1580080,1585200,little ones up here  maybe one up here at the top
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1585200,1592080,color it in i know i'm going fast so if  you guys need to pause the video and  take time to add more spots
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1592080,1600000,heart spots on your little ladybug now  we're gonna switch back to our pink  let's add two antennas coming out of the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1600000,1606320,top of our little ladybug head we'll  draw one going like this and one coming
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1606320,1613200,out this way you wanna draw two antennas  one  and two oh i like how that one curves
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1613200,1619760,down let's switch to our red crayon back  to our red and let's add little hearts
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1619760,1627039,on top of our antenna so first let's  draw the v on top of the antenna right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1627039,1633919,here  one yeah oh that's really cute i like  that shape too that's like a triangle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1633919,1640880,shape i'm gonna add little bumps for  heart on top of my antenna you guys  could just do a circle or a triangle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1640880,1646320,like olivia i'm gonna add another  triangle oh i like that circle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1646320,1653360,there we go we have our valentine's  antenna now we're switching to our black  crayon and let's draw the phase i'm
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1653360,1659919,gonna draw a circle and color it in and  another circle for the other eye you  wanna draw two circles
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1659919,1666000,oh that's so cute and then yes a little  happy smile next let's draw the legs to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1666000,1671200,our ladybug we're gonna add six  legs so first let's do three
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1671200,1676720,legs on the back i'm gonna do three legs  over here three lines one two three
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1676720,1683360,oh and  oh you're adding a lot of legs i like  that i'm gonna add three more for a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1683360,1688480,total of six legs and i love that you  have more than six that's perfect let's
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1688480,1696399,switch back to our pink crayon let's add  little rosy cheeks two pink cheeks on
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1696399,1704480,the bottom of each eye  oh that's really cute  [Music]
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1704559,1711039,olivia give me five we did it we  finished coloring and drawing our  valentine's ladybug i love your drawings
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1711039,1718720,so much the next time i draw my ladybug  i'm going to draw a big head like you  and big cheeks
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1720080,1725520,yeah we do we hope you had a lot of fun  and we'll see you later our friends  goodbye
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1725520,1730799,hey our friends they're going to draw a  fully surprise for your teacher yeah we  are when it's all folded up it's going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1730799,1736080,to say best ever and then when you open  it up it'll say best teacher ever we
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1736080,1741440,hope you're going to follow along with  us you need your drawing supplies we're  going to use a pencil and a marker you
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1741440,1746880,also need some paper and something to  come with yeah all right you ready to  start yes first we're going to take the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1746880,1752480,top edge and line it up with the bottom  edge  of our paper
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1752480,1757278,crease it down the middle and then out  to the corners
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1758159,1763520,next we're going to take the top flap  and line that back up with the top edge
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1763520,1767840,line it up and crease it down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1768720,1775200,whoa oh no hold on  there you go  next we're going to flip over our paper
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1775200,1780960,and we're going to repeat that same step  take that top flap and line it up with  the top edge
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1780960,1786399,and crease it down  there we go  and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1786399,1793360,and  save it  there we go there we go  now this last fold is just a guide fold
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1793360,1800159,so let's open it up and we'll flatten it  out and then flip it back over we also  have scratch paper that we can put
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1800159,1806159,underneath our drawing paper this is to  protect our table when we're drawing  with our markers it's red paper but you
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1806159,1813120,could use whatever scratch paper you  have at home or in your classroom now  we're ready to draw we're first going to  use our pencils
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1813120,1821440,we're going to write the word best above  this fold and then we're let's write the  word ever below the fold so first up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1821440,1826799,here i'm going to draw b  or right  b
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1826799,1832559,e  s  t
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1832559,1838240,now if you want you i'm using all caps  but you could write lowercase letters
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1838240,1845120,you could also mix it up maybe you have  a capital b and a lowercase est  i like that that looks awesome now let's
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1845120,1851840,draw ever or write ever the word below  the fold  draw e
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1852159,1857919,v  e  r
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1857919,1865200,and i'm kind of writing that those  letters a little bit bigger and they're  kind of spaced out a little  more but you could also do it any way
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1865200,1871039,you want  now let's switch to our marker and this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1871039,1876720,is a lot of fun we're going to trace  around the letters with our marker to  draw block letters or bigger letters
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1876720,1883440,that we can color in later so first i'm  going to trace around the letter b
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1883760,1892240,well that really makes the letter  b bigger ah b for bigger b for bigger
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1892240,1899200,then inside of the b i'm going to draw a  line down  and then another curve around that looks
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1899200,1904640,like the letter d  for the inside of our letter b  we're going to do another one down here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1904640,1910320,at the bottom good education  i'm not sure maybe that's confusing okay
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1910320,1916080,then we  now we're going to trace around the  letter e and i'm also using overlapping
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1916080,1922720,so this part i'm going to come out from  the b  come up over the e oh yeah you have more
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1922720,1929519,space i love that your your drawing is  different  there you go and then trace around
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1929519,1935039,in back out  i went kind of fast so if you need to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1935039,1940480,rewind the video or even pause the video  if you need extra time
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1940480,1946320,you did it good job that looks really  cool now let's do the s  first i'm going to draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1946320,1953600,another letter s that's bigger  and to the left of the guideline or the  pencil line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1954320,1960000,then you can also do the same thing  on the other side draw another letter s
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1960000,1965919,that comes around  on the right side of the pencil the  guideline
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1966320,1973120,then we can connect those two s's  together one at the top and then also  down at the bottom and i'm overlapping
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1973120,1979279,so i only have a little line down here  and now let's trace around the letter t  we're going to first draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1979279,1986640,across the top  and on each side you can go past the  pencil  then we can draw a short line down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1986640,1991919,in  down further across  back up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1991919,1998640,and then finish the top of the t  now let's repeat those same steps for  the word ever i'm going to start over
bt_FD-h3Gqw,1998640,2004080,here we could even draw this even bigger  i'm going to draw really big letters
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2004080,2010240,just trace around out repeating the same  steps so i'm going to go a little faster  enormous
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2010240,2016720,oh that's a good word that starts with e  enormous enormous enormous now i'm going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2016720,2022240,to draw the letter v we'll first draw a  big  letter v underneath
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2022240,2027760,the pencil line  then we can draw another letter v that's
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2027760,2032880,smaller on the inside  and then let's connect the top on the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2032880,2038960,left and also on the right  then let's repeat the same step for the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2038960,2044840,second letter e  just trace around it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2048240,2055839,next let's trace around our  last letter  r  so i draw a big line down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2055839,2061200,and then come across like this and also  down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2061200,2065838,then we could also draw an upside down v
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2066800,2073839,and then connect the bottom  on the left and also on the right  and then inside of the r draw another
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2073839,2080960,letter d kind of like what we did for  the b now we're going to switch to our  pencil well the our eraser so that we
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2080960,2087879,can erase the guidelines or the pencil  marks inside of each letter
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2091839,2099359,remember to pause the video to take  extra time to finish that step all right  now let's unfold our paper and flatten
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2099359,2105280,it out let's switch to our pencil we're  going to write teacher but we're going  to write it in a weird way let's start
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2105280,2110400,with the letter c in the middle of our  paper and that's so that we can center
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2110400,2118720,the word and hopefully have enough room  for all of the letters  so c is the middle of the word teacher
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2118720,2125520,yeah and then we can write her over here  on the right side so we're going to  write h
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2125760,2131838,e  and then r
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2134560,2140000,we're going to write t over here on the  left side but we're going to draw the  letters or write the letters backwards
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2140000,2145680,so we're going to first start with the  letter a we're gonna  up down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2145680,2152240,and across  yeah and then we can
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2152240,2158200,write the letter e  next to that one
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2159680,2166880,and then barely we have enough room to  write the last letter or the first  letter actually t
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2166880,2172960,t  we did it  we fit the word teacher in there but see  how it's balanced and all of the letters
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2172960,2178320,look pretty much the same size now we're  ready to switch back to our marker and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2178320,2184880,we're going to do the same thing we did  for best and ever we're going to trace  around each of these letters so we're  going to start over here and draw a line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2184880,2190240,down in and then back down again oh yeah  you could start up there kind of like
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2190240,2196560,how we started  on that t  come out  down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2196560,2201320,back down and then across the bottom
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2201680,2209599,mine went off the paper that's okay  all right now let's do the e  trace around the letter e
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2210240,2215680,and  i'm using overlapping again  so i'm only drawing part of it behind
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2215680,2221599,the letter t  and then let's do the letter a i'm going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2221599,2228480,to draw an upside down v that goes  over  and back down across the a and then we
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2228480,2234960,can draw a small  kind of looks like an upside down v but  not not quite it's got a little flat at
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2234960,2241520,the top  and then we can connect the bottom  to the outside and then let's draw a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2241520,2247119,triangle or upside down  v inside  and then connect the bottom
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2247119,2254400,all right now let's draw the letter c  we're going to draw a big letter first  that goes around the outside
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2254400,2260640,of the pencil  oh i like how you did it oh yeah no  that's cool you can do it differently
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2260640,2266079,and i'm going to draw a smaller letter  seat on the inside  connect the bottom and the top
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2266079,2274160,now the more practice you have of making  block letters the easier it gets and  we're going to trace around the letter h
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2276079,2282520,there we go  then also the letter e
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2285280,2288960,and then the last letter r
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2290560,2296320,go all the way around i'm going to draw  that upside down v  at the bottom
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2296320,2304079,connect the left side and also the right  and then draw that letter d  on the inside of the r
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2304079,2313079,there ah we did it before we color it  let's switch back to our eraser and  erase all of the pencil guidelines
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2313359,2318480,now we're ready to color our drawings  this part we're going to fast forward  but at the end you can pause the video
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2318480,2325680,to match our same color or you can color  it any way you want you could also add  extra things or decorations inside of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2325680,2331760,the folding surprise like a pencil oh  yeah a pencil on an apple that would be  super cool all right you ready to fast
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2331760,2334320,forward yes
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2339200,2345599,hadley we did it we finished drawing and  coloring our best ever teacher well it  just says best ever
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2345599,2351760,teacher teacher  you guys can pause the video right now  to match your same coloring and even add
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2351760,2357760,these same details or you could add  different things maybe your teacher  really likes a sports team and you could
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2357760,2363520,draw that sports logo in the background  or maybe your teacher has a favorite  candy bar oh that would be really cool
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2363520,2368960,you could add the candy bar or you could  add maybe her favorite food or his  favorite food when you're adding the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2368960,2374480,extra details be sure to draw them below  this top fold and above the bottom fold
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2374480,2380720,that way when you fold it up it's hidden  we'll be had fun drawing with us we do  we hope you had a lot of fun and we hope
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2380720,2386640,you take extra time to add your teachers  favorite things to the inside oh and  don't forget to give this to your

bt_FD-h3Gqw,2393520,2399599,unicorn horn yeah oh maybe some ears  we hope you're gonna follow along you  need your drawing supplies we're gonna
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2399599,2405680,use a pencil first and then a marker you  also need paper and something to color  width yeah you ready to start yes let's
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2405680,2413280,first draw a big circle for the outside  shape of our donut i'm going to start  here and draw a big circle oh i'm going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2413280,2419520,to go over it again and you can press  lightly so that it's easier to erase at
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2419520,2427040,the very end  and you can go back over it until you  get the shape just the way you want it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2427040,2433599,and then if you have extra lines you can  erase those so that you don't get  confused with which line you want to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2433599,2436599,keep
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2438880,2445359,remember to pause the video if you need  extra time now let's draw the inside of  our donut i'm going to draw another
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2445359,2453040,circle that's smaller  in the center  and about that size go back over it i'm
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2453040,2458960,pressing hard but you can press softly  so it's easier to erase we did it we  finished drawing the general shape of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2458960,2466960,our donut let's switch to our marker  next and now we can add all of the  details to our unicorn donut or turn it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2466960,2473839,into a unicorn donut let's first start  by drawing a bow i'm going to draw right  here i'm going to draw the center of the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2473839,2480520,bow  i'll cut it you could draw a circle or  kind of a square shape
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2481440,2487280,then let's draw a  diagonal line coming out of the left and  also the right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2487280,2493559,and then we could also draw a diagonal  line coming out on the bottom too
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2494000,2499680,then let's connect the top down to the  bottom on the left and also on the right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2499680,2505680,oh we could also add two little wrinkle  lines on the inside
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2505680,2512240,now let's draw our donuts hair the  unicorn donut's hair  let's start on top of the the bow right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2512240,2518400,here i'm going to draw an s-curve we'll  come up  down and then back up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2521760,2530160,then right here we could draw the bottom  of the hair coming down across and then  connect over here to this side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2531839,2540078,let's add the funny face next i'm going  to draw a cute little smile right here  underneath the hair
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2540480,2546640,and we could also draw a little tongue  sticking out to the side if you want but  you could change your face too and add
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2546640,2552240,different details i'm going to draw  a circle for the left eye and also the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2552240,2558960,same size circle for the right eye you  could change it so that maybe one eye is  winking or closed
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2558960,2566160,where both of them are closed i like  that yeah  we  should add i'm going to add a highlight
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2566160,2572800,to each eye and then also eyelashes  i like your eyelashes too
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2572800,2580240,i like that your eyelashes are different  i'm going to color in the big circle but  leave the little circle white
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2580240,2587359,remember to pause the video if you need  extra time now let's switch back to our  pencil well actually the eraser part of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2587359,2594240,our pencil this part we're going to fast  forward but you can pause the video and  take time to erase the guidelines going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2594240,2599520,through the bow and also the hair  let's switch back to our marker and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2599520,2604800,trace over the outside  guidelines
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2604800,2608480,of the pencil or the circle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2610880,2617200,let's also trace  over the inside circle  right on top
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2617200,2623200,of the pencil lines  what's our donut missing frosting yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2623200,2628880,frosting let's draw it dripping down the  bottom i'm going to draw a wavy wiggly
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2628880,2635318,line going across the bottom  of the donut
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2636800,2642480,oh i like that you connected to the  center that's cool what should we add  next the horn yeah it just looks like a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2642480,2650240,cute donut let's turn it in yeah with  hair let's turn it into a unicorn donut  we're gonna draw an upside down v but at
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2650240,2655359,the very top look i drew a kind of a  curve so that it's not a sharp horn
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2655359,2659759,that's a friendly unicorn horn
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2660720,2667280,and we can also draw diagonal lines  going across  for unicorn horn
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2668720,2675599,now what should we add the ears oh that  would make it even cuter i'm going to  draw a another upside down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2675599,2683760,v  this one's a little wider than the  unicorn horn  come up and then down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2686319,2691440,let's also draw the inside of the ear we  can draw another shape that matches but
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2691440,2693920,smaller
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2697520,2703440,had like we did it we finished drawing  our unicorn donut it looks really cute  except we still need to color it yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2703440,2708960,this part will fast forward but at the  end you can pause the video to match  your same coloring or you can color any
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2708960,2715520,way you want well before we color let's  use our eraser again and erase any of  the pencil lines you can still see you

bt_FD-h3Gqw,2760960,2766000,lot of food we're gonna draw a healthy  snack stack yeah we hope you're gonna  follow along with us you need your
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2766000,2773359,drawing supplies you ready to start yes  we're gonna fold our paper first let's  take the top edge and we're gonna line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2773359,2778560,it up with the bottom edge  down here  and when you get it lined up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2778560,2784800,crease it down the middle and then out  to the corners  next we're gonna take this top flap and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2784800,2792880,we're gonna fold it back up up to the  top edge line it up and then crease it  down the middle and out to the corners
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2792880,2798319,yeah  there you go now let's flip over our  paper and we're going to repeat that
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2798319,2806079,same fold we're going to take this flap  fold it up to the top edge  and crease it down the middle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2806079,2811440,and  crease it down the middle then we're  going to take this last fold and unfold
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2811440,2816560,it and flatten it out  then we can flip our paper back over so
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2816560,2822319,when we're all done it should open like  this  next we're going to take scratch paper
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2822319,2827599,and put it underneath our drawing paper  this is just a protective table and it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2827599,2832640,doesn't have to be red we just it  matches our table yeah now we're ready
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2832640,2838160,to draw so we're going to use our  markers but you guys at home can use  whatever you have like a pencil or even
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2838160,2844400,a black crayon first thing we're going  to draw is an apple and we're going to  draw half of it above this fold and half
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2844400,2850800,of it below the fold so let's start here  and we're going to draw a little curve  that comes up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2850800,2858240,and then curves back down but then stop  so it comes up this is the left side of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2858240,2863440,our apple  and then we're going to draw the right  side we're going to draw it curving up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2863440,2869520,also  and then  into the first curve
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2871119,2877680,yeah there's the top of our apple now  let's draw the bottom of our apple below  the fold we're going to come down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2877680,2883040,this  and we're going to draw a little bump  down here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2883680,2889280,yeah and we can draw the other side also  doing the same thing come down curve up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2889280,2897520,and then connect it in looks like a  tooth oh it does look like a tooth we  need to color it red yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2897599,2903119,now let's draw the stem to the top of  our apple we'll draw a little curve  coming out and we could draw another one
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2903119,2908559,right next to it but towards the top i'm  getting further away so it gets thicker
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2908559,2915520,there you go and then we can draw a  little curve to connect those two lines  oh and we should draw a leaf let's draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2915520,2919200,a curve coming out of the stem
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2921119,2928240,and then up here at the top we're going  to draw a little point and then we'll  curve into the apple
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2928240,2933440,yeah we could also draw the center of  the leaf  draw a curve in the middle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2933440,2940240,out to the point and then we could draw  the two little two little curves like  that for the veins and the leaf and we
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2940240,2945599,could draw another one coming out the  other side  we did it now let's add a funny face to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2945599,2953359,our apple we're going to draw  i'm going to draw a circle right here  and another circle over here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2953359,2959200,on the other side  got always add eyelashes yeah if you  want to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2959200,2965040,i'm gonna draw another circle or an oval  inside the top left for the highlight
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2965040,2970720,and then let's color in the big circle  but leave that little circle white
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2970720,2978640,next let's draw the mouth you don't have  to draw it exactly the same as us you  could change your mouth if you want to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2978720,2987280,i'm going to draw it open i'm going to  turn this into a bean shape curve around  and then connecting to the other side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2987280,2993040,mine's really happy  i'm going to add teeth also
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2993040,2998880,there we go  and  a tongue down here at the bottom i'm  gonna draw two little curves for the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,2998880,3007040,tongue  oh let's color in the center shape  for the inside of the mouth
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3008480,3016319,we did it now let's open up our folding  surprise and we can flatten it out so  that it's easier to draw on the paper
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3016319,3023119,there we go now we have the top of our  apple up here in the bottom down here so  we can have an apple on top of our stack
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3023119,3030000,and also at the bottom greek draw a  really long apple oh you could  if you wanted a tall apple
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3030000,3037280,but let's add more fruit in between  first i'm going to draw a banana right  here in the middle of the stack so i'm
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3037280,3042960,going to draw a little curve looks like  a smile  well maybe even make it a little curv
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3042960,3049440,curve up a little more  there you go  and then i'm going to draw a little
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3049440,3056319,guide point right here  so i want to come back to that point but  let's draw another curve right here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3056319,3061359,that's going to curve out and get  thicker and then curve back in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3061359,3068319,towards the top  well i like this shape of your banana  that's awesome
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3068319,3074800,now let's draw the stem on our banana  we're going to draw two lines coming up  further and then we can connect them at
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3074800,3079839,the top  anytime we go too fast or if we fast  forward the video what can our art
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3079839,3088160,friends do pause the video yeah if you  need extra time she'll keep going yeah  let's also add another line up here and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3088160,3093680,also down at the bottom  and then we can color in those two
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3093680,3100000,shapes  we could also add a funny face this part  i think we should fast forward because
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3100000,3106160,there are friends we're gonna have a lot  of fun we are gonna yeah you guys can  pause the video and add a different
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3106160,3112880,funny face you don't have to repeat the  same steps as us i think that would be  funny if they change their funny faces
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3112880,3118880,like that yeah like that definitely that  one's winking crew are gonna have  eyelashes okay good
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3118880,3124960,i'm gonna draw a really crazy mouth on  this one  maybe not too crazy just stay rectangle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3124960,3131920,shape and then  teeth  and color in the middle part there we go
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3131920,3139359,what should we draw next some carrots  carrots oh i like carrots let's draw an  a shape or an upside down v i'm going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3139359,3144880,come up like this  and then back down and we're  let's use overlapping to make our
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3144880,3150240,drawing look more 3d  so go up  and then down and then we're going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3150240,3157040,imagine that going behind the banana and  we can draw a u-shape  like that see how that shape looks like
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3157040,3163040,it's yeah there you go  it's behind our banana  okay now we could draw maybe the the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3163040,3170400,leaves coming off the end so i'm going  to draw a couple lines like this coming  out the bottom
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3170559,3176640,and then we could draw  the leaves  down here at the end now we want to make
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3176640,3182720,sure that we don't draw anything below  this bottom fold so down here this is a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3182720,3189119,guide fold so when we fold it like this  everything's hidden and you won't see a  carrot yeah you won't see the bottom of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3189119,3195680,the carrot okay all right let's add even  more healthy snacks what else should we  add we could add another carrot let's do
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3195680,3202319,that i'm going to add another carrot  right next to it  like  this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3202319,3210720,and your drawing is a little different  than mine so it's okay  yeah if you change it that one's thick
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3210720,3217920,okay now let's draw the leaves coming  out the bottom of our carrot and we'll  draw three lines
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3217920,3223760,and then we could draw  the little bumpy line that comes over  here and connects to the other leaves
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3223760,3229280,and we could draw more bumpy lines on  the other side we need some funny faces  on this one where are you going to put
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3229280,3234480,yours i'm going to apply the tippy top  okay  i'm going to put it at the very bottom
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3234480,3241040,okay  i like that one that's trying to kiss
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3241040,3248000,the other carrot that's all there we go  there we go okay mine's angry over here  i also added texture lines on the carrot
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3248000,3255200,but you could leave those off okay let's  add grapes next i'm going to draw a  bunch of circles so first one i'm going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3255200,3261520,to draw right here above the banana  and then we can use a lot of overlapping
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3261520,3270640,well let's before we use overlapping  let's draw a full circle right here  and maybe another full circle up here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3271119,3276799,so we've got three grapes let's use  overlapping  to draw grapes behind these first ones
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3276799,3284559,we drew so we could draw  little curves we're just going to  imagine  yeah just like that imagine the grapes
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3284559,3289839,behind these other grapes that we've  already drawn  i'm going to draw a bunch of them i'm
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3289839,3294880,going to draw let's see another one  right here  and uh
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3294880,3302079,i'm just gonna add a bunch more grapes  now you guys at home can also even add  different fruit you could also add veg
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3302079,3307359,more vegetables or could i like more you  could add pears yeah pears oh that would
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3307359,3312640,be cool or even a pineapple oh yeah that  would take up a lot of room
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3315680,3323040,let's just add a couple funny faces and  then you can also draw two lines coming  out for the stem on our grapes and then
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3323040,3330559,connect it at the top  yeah just like that next let's finish  the top apple right here so we're gonna
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3330559,3337760,continue this line and connect it to the  grape  or grapes and then we can connect this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3337760,3345040,line over here to our carrots  we can also imagine it going behind the  carrots like that
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3345040,3350720,and then we can also have it come down  let's have it come down here  and then we're going to curve back up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3350720,3357119,just kind of like how we did down here  and then we can also draw the other side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3357119,3364400,of the apple if you have a little room  left yeah all right now let's draw the  mouth for this apple i'm going to draw a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3364400,3369760,different one and you want to draw it  below this line yes make sure it's below  the fold
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3369760,3375119,i'm going to draw a line like that  and  a crazy
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3375119,3381680,line like that then i'm gonna draw the  teeth  on top and also on bottom
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3381680,3388319,and then a tongue back here  oh  i like that mouth now what's my favorite
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3388319,3394480,it's a wobbly mouth maybe he's a little  worried because the  fall yeah the healthy snack stack might
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3394480,3401040,uh  collapse tip over and collapse yeah  next let's finish the apple down here at
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3401040,3409440,the bottom so i'm gonna extend this line  over here for the top  of our second apple
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3409680,3415119,and then we can also draw the other  side of our apple and connect it to the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3415119,3420160,fold  yeah let's also draw eyes down here i'm  gonna draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3420160,3425680,um really happy eyes kind of like some  of you  do you have some like this yet oh yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3425680,3430720,on your banana  oh and i'm gonna add eyelashes too
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3430720,3436799,this one's gonna have eyebrows okay  and a mustache
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3436880,3443680,go ahead  i want to see the must  like how it curls at the end okay let's
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3443680,3449839,also  let's add the stem  just like we did  up here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3449839,3458480,and we can add a leaf but this time  let's draw the center  curve first so the center of the leaf
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3458640,3465200,and then we can curve  back to the apple  and then also connect to the banana up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3465200,3472490,here for the top  of our leaf oh let's also add those  lines right here too
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3472490,3477760,[Music]  we did it we finished drawing our  healthy snack stack but we still need to

bt_FD-h3Gqw,3566640,3571760,room for the body we're going to start  here we'll draw a little v shape in the  middle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3571760,3579280,of our paper  and then we can draw the top of the nose  draw a little curve on top
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3579280,3585839,and then let's draw the mouth we'll draw  a curved  w right below

bt_FD-h3Gqw,3591359,3597520,and then we could also draw the tongue  inside and draw a little curve  now let's draw the eyes and instead of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3597520,3602880,drawing a circle let's draw big almost  i'm going to draw about that size well
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3602880,3608480,really big  and then another one the same size over  here for the right side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3608480,3614960,oh really big really big  i feel sorry  super big
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3614960,3622559,okay now let's draw a circle in the top  right for the highlight  in each eye
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3622640,3627839,and then this part we're going to fast  forward but we're going to color in the  big oval but leave the little circle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3627839,3633520,white  now if you need more time remember you  can always pause the video
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3633520,3638960,what should we add next eyelashes yes  you can have three little eyelashes
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3638960,3645440,on each eye or you could add more if you  want  now what should we draw the horn the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3645440,3652640,unicorn horn okay we'll draw an upside  down v right above the nose
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3653839,3660400,and then down at the bottom let's draw a  little curve to connect  kind of looks like an upside down carrot
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3660400,3666480,okay  we can also draw the texture on the horn  i'm going to draw little curves going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3666480,3673680,across the top  now let's draw the ears we could draw an
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3673680,3681040,upside down v coming up  and then back down  those are big ears
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3681680,3688880,and then we're going to do the same  thing on the other side  we want them to look the same on on both  sides and try to match the same height
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3688880,3694880,and we'll come down to the same spot on  each side now let's draw the shape of  our cat's head we can come down we're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3694880,3702240,going to draw a cheek  then we're going to come under  across and then connect up to the other

bt_FD-h3Gqw,3708559,3714160,shape that we first drew for the ear but  smaller inside
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3714640,3720000,and then we can draw little zigzags to  connect the bottom
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3720000,3725200,now let's do the same thing over here  for the right ear we'll come up back  down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3725200,3731920,and then zigzag  at the bottom oh i just connected it oh  i like it that's okay right there's no
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3731920,3738720,mistakes you could even add zigzags on  top of that if you wanted  yeah just like that that looks cool you
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3738720,3745119,could also add a line on this side so  that they match yeah i like that oh it's  cute okay now let's draw the body and

bt_FD-h3Gqw,3793119,3799039,and then back up we're trying to make  the back legs look kind of like the  front legs too
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3800720,3807520,and then right here at the end we can  curve up  and connect into the body
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3808240,3814880,yeah just like that it's a skinny body i  like it and then we can also add two  little toe lines for that foot
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3814880,3822839,and then let's add another leg right  here  that matches so the same size u

bt_FD-h3Gqw,3931039,3936559,our biannual markers if you have the  same set we use r502 for the main color
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3936559,3942559,of our cat and then we used our yellow  orange blue and a bright pink oh also a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3942559,3947920,purple to color the rest of it but you  don't have to color it the same way that  we did you could color it your own way
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3947920,3953440,yeah you could also use crayons or oil  pastels yeah you don't have to use our  markers yeah one of my other favorite
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3953440,3960559,things that we did was we added another  reflection on the bottom of the eye to  make it look even shinier and cuter and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3960559,3967280,cuter of course yeah we used our  prismacolor colored pencils the color is  deco aqua but you could use any color a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3967280,3973280,light color for that reflection we hope  we have our finger on your cat unicorn  we do and we hope you take extra time to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3973280,3979280,add even more things to your drawing in  the background maybe you could add  clouds or a rainbow oh a rainbow would
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3979280,3984559,be really cool or even more cats with  horns jumping out of a rainbow yeah and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,3984559,3990960,we'll see you later our friends goodbye  here friends staring and draw panda yeah  you need your drawing supplies we hope

bt_FD-h3Gqw,4004799,4011359,yeah then we can  draw a curve to connect the top looks  like an upside down triangle and then we
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4011359,4016640,can color in that shape  now we can draw our panda's mouth we'll
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4016640,4022880,draw a u shape on the left and also on  the right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4023920,4030960,then let's draw our panda's eyes we're  going to start over here and draw a  circle  about this size and we're going to draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4030960,4035839,another circle the same size  on the right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4036400,4041680,yeah  now let's draw a small circle or oval in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4041680,4047039,the top left for the highlight  make our panda's eyes look shiny and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4047039,4052400,friendly and then color in the mixing  bowl leave the little circle white yes
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4052400,4059280,we say that a lot don't we  remember to pause the video when we fast
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4059280,4064640,forward or if we go too fast and you  need extra time
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4064640,4070960,now let's draw another circle around  each eye  this is because we're going to draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4070960,4076160,spots  around our panda's eyes and we don't  want to just color in the whole thing
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4076160,4082559,black  there we go  oh it's already starting to well not
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4082559,4088000,quite okay let's  now let's draw our panda's head we're  going to draw a big circle but i'm going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4088000,4093520,to start let's see we'll start up here  and draw a big circle that comes around
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4093520,4099120,i'm gonna come close to the mouth down  here at the bottom  and then we're gonna come back up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4099120,4104839,and connect to the top where we started
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4112400,4119758,now we're ready to draw the spots around  our pandas eyes we're going to draw an  oval that comes around like this and i'm
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4119758,4126960,gonna touch the outside of his head  or her head  like that
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4127359,4133600,yeah if you have more room you could  just draw the spot around  oh i love the way that you did it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4133600,4139120,good job  now let's draw the same spot over here  on the other side i'm gonna try to make
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4139120,4144560,it look the same but that's okay if it  looks a little different  and i love that our two drawings don't
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4144560,4151120,look exactly the same because the most  important thing is to have fun yeah and  to practice practice remember to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4151120,4158318,practice all right now let's draw our  panda's ears we're going to draw  an upside down u over here on the left
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4158318,4163600,and also on the right  those might be a little too big for
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4163600,4168798,panic ears that's okay i like the size  that you're drawing
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4168798,4175040,now we're going to draw the pause the  front pause coming down so let's start  here and we're going to draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4175040,4181278,a letter v but look i'm going to leave a  little gap at the bottom so you could  draw two diagonal lines you could also
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4181278,4187679,draw oh yeah just keep going you're  doing great  there you go and then another diagonal
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4187679,4194320,line coming down on the right side and  we left a little gap down here at the  bottom we're gonna curve around
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4194320,4203760,and we're gonna draw  the whole arm coming back up oh that's a  big i like how strong his paws are
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4203760,4209679,i like it yes that's perfect and then  let's do the same thing on the other  side we'll curve around i'm going to try
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4209679,4214880,to match the other side oh we did it i'm  going to make the other one big because
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4214880,4220880,the other one is big yeah you did it all  right now let's also draw a little curve
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4220880,4226800,right here underneath the chin  and then we're also going to draw the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4226800,4231840,bottom of the body right here or his  belly and then let's draw the pause
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4231840,4237600,we're gonna draw him sitting down or her  sitting down we're gonna draw an oval  shape we'll come out like this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4237600,4242679,around  and then back in
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4246800,4253280,yeah  yeah that's perfect and then let's do  the same thing over here on the right  side we'll try to make them the same
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4253280,4260719,size  do you know what it means when it's the  same on both sides  there's a big word it starts with an s
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4260719,4265760,oh keep keep concentrating on  same thing i was distracting you and you
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4265760,4272719,were looking off into space while you  were drawing that's dangerous  the same situation same situation
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4272719,4279600,symmetry that's the word have you ever  heard that before no symmetry means that  if you drew a line right down the middle
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4279600,4286239,and folded it in half it's the same on  both sides like a butterfly  yeah if you were looking on both sides
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4286239,4291520,of a butterfly or on our panda bear it's  the same on both sides and it has two
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4291520,4298480,eyes on the same side yeah and ears two  ears on the same side yeah that's called  symmetry or symmetrical can you remember
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4298480,4305040,that yes symmetrical  next let's draw the paw prints on the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4305040,4311040,bottom of our panda's foot i'm going to  draw a smaller oval down at the bottom
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4311040,4316800,yeah and we could draw three circles  above it for the toes
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4317600,4323040,pandas have more toes than that but  we're drawing a cartoon version now  let's draw the same thing over here on
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4323040,4330000,the right symmetrical  there you go super symmetrical super  symmetrical and then three circles for
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4330000,4336400,the toes  what do pandas like to eat bamboo yeah  they like to eat bamboo let's draw some
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4336400,4343199,we're gonna draw a line sticking out  right here we'll draw one  on the right side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4343199,4349120,there you go  and then let's draw another one right  next to it this is for the other side of  the bamboo
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4349120,4355440,stock  and then up at the top let's draw a  curved line
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4355440,4361440,and then we can also draw curved lines  coming down for the rest of the bamboo
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4361440,4368560,a little it has little segments that's  what i think makes bamboo really cool  now let's add another bamboo stock right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4368560,4374239,next to it we'll draw two more lines  maybe these ones aren't as tall
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4375600,4383520,there you go and then we'll connect the  top  and then let's draw a couple more curved  lines coming down the stalk
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4383520,4390320,cool all right let's draw the bamboo  leaves i'm going to draw a diagonal line  that comes out
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4391520,4397520,and then let's curve back  there's one leaf let's draw another leaf
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4397520,4402719,on the other side we'll draw a diagonal  line coming out then let's draw another  curve coming back for the rest of the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4402719,4408480,leaf  let's do a couple more leaves just  repeat that same step over here on the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4408480,4415120,other side  well that looks cool we could even add  more leaves but i think i'll leave it  just like that
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4415120,4421120,now we're going to draw more stalks of  bamboo over here on the left but we're  going to fast forward this part because
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4421120,4427840,we're just repeating the same steps all  right you ready to fast forward yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4428560,4434960,we did it we finished drawing our panda  and also our bamboo the cool part about  that is you could remember those steps
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4434960,4441280,pretty easily and add bamboo to a  different drawing what do we still need  to do to our drawing color it yeah this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4441280,4446640,part we're gonna fast forward again but  at the end you could pause the video if  you want to match our same color it's
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4446640,4452840,gonna be pretty easy though black and  green yeah you ready yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4457840,4462960,awesome give me five you did awesome on  coloring your panda i love it do you

bt_FD-h3Gqw,4468880,4475120,going to take time to color their  drawings also you could add even more  bamboo in the background that would be
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4475120,4480159,awesome or a whole forest a whole forest  of bamboo and more pandas that would be
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4480159,4485679,really cool yeah we hope you had a lot  of fun drawing your pandas we do we hope  you had a lot of fun and we'll see you
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4485679,4491440,later our friends goodbye  here friends so you're gonna draw ice  cream yeah unicorn ice cream it's gonna
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4491440,4496880,be a lot of fun we hope you're gonna  follow along with us because art is  always better with friends friends like
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4496880,4502320,you now you need your drawing supplies  in this lesson we're going to use a  pencil and a marker but you could just
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4502320,4508960,use a pencil if you want you also need  some some paper and something to go with  yeah all right let's start yeah let's
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4508960,4514080,use our pencil first to draw guidelines  before we use our marker let's first
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4514080,4519360,draw the top of our ice cream we're  going to draw a big upside down u or a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4519360,4526800,rainbow line we're going to start here  and we're going to draw  a big oh it's a lot of ice cream
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4526800,4532320,and you can press lightly if you want to  make it easier to erase at the end i'm
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4532320,4538560,pressing down kind of hard so that our  art friends can see on the camera all  right now let's draw the bottom of our
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4538560,4543920,ice cream we're going to draw  bumpy  line going all the way across from the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4543920,4548320,left side over to the right side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4549360,4557040,yeah yeah that looks awesome then we  could also draw the cone let's draw the  letter v i'm going to come down and then
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4557040,4563360,back up on the right side  there's our ice cream this is pretty  easy right yeah now let's switch to our
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4563360,4570640,marker now we can draw the unicorn  details on our ice cream cone let's  first draw the hair or the this could be
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4570640,4576719,the whipped cream on top we're going to  start here and let's draw a big curve
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4576719,4581840,it's going to come around like this  oh it kind of looks like a second scoop
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4581840,4588400,on top of our ice cream  yeah and then we can draw the bottom of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4588400,4594000,that coming over to the side  i went further
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4594000,4601199,and then we can curve back up and  connect  now let's draw the horn coming out of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4601199,4607120,the whipped cream or the hair  if it's like a if it's an actual unicorn  this could be the hair for the horse so
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4607120,4612239,we're going to draw an upside down v for  the horn
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4615120,4621600,and then we can also draw diagonal lines  going across  for the texture of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4621600,4629040,the horn  now let's add ears we're going to draw  an upside down v it comes up and then
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4629040,4635600,back down it's like a cat oh yeah a cat  or or a horse like a unicorn
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4635600,4640719,then we can also draw that same shape on  the right side we're going to come up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4640719,4647199,and then back down  let's also draw another upside down v
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4647199,4653040,inside but smaller  and then we can connect the bottom right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4653040,4658239,here  let's do that same shape on the right  side
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4658239,4665760,up and then back down and then connect  the bottom before we draw more with our  marker let's switch to our eraser and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4665760,4672000,let's erase the guidelines inside of the  hair  and then also
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4672000,4678719,here on the ears  then we can sweep off the shavings from
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4678719,4684880,our eraser and if we went too fast  because we sped that part up remember  you can always pause the video if you
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4684880,4691600,need extra time now let's switch back to  our marker and we have little space  right here on the left and on the left
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4691600,4698560,side and the right we can connect mine's  touching but over here we can connect  the ear into the hair now let's draw the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4698560,4705040,rest of our ice cream  coming down  on the left side and also over here on
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4705040,4711840,the right  then we can draw the bottom of the ice  cream we're going to draw just trace
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4711840,4717199,over the pencil lines  with our marker  all the way across
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4717199,4724080,to the other side  let's also trace over the cone
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4724080,4728960,guidelines  down and back up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4730080,4736880,let's also add more hair going behind  the ice cream so i'm going to draw a  curve that comes down from the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4736880,4742800,unicorn horn  and then we're going to imagine that  going behind the ear i'm going to draw a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4742800,4748880,little  curve that comes up  and then back down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4748880,4755040,well and then let's do another  s curve or another curve that comes out  further
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4755040,4760159,and then let's draw a big curve  connecting back to the ice cream
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4760159,4766960,now that looks like horse hair yeah  now let's draw the mouth i'm going to  draw it kind of looks like a w shape
bt_FD-h3Gqw,4766960,4773520,we're going to go a little curve up and  then another one up  w

bt_FD-h3Gqw,5098800,5106080,and stop right there  i like yours so much it looks really
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5106080,5112080,cool hadley and i'm glad that our two  drawings don't look exactly the same and  it's okay for our friend's drawings are
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5112080,5118239,different too because the most important  thing is to have fun and to practice  practice remember to practice all right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5118239,5124639,let's keep going okay he kind of looks  like toothless a little bit  we need to make him scarier but he he's

bt_FD-h3Gqw,5130239,5136400,this  down and then we're going to curve into  the bottom jaw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5138159,5143600,there you go now let's draw the little  details around the head first we're  going to draw a diagonal line over the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5143600,5149440,eye  well that makes them look more angry  then we're going to go around the eye
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5149440,5156000,and then we're going to come up and  connect  now let's draw another shape in front of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5156000,5163840,that shape  right here we're going to draw a  sideways u  and then we'll connect up to the top
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5163840,5169199,we can also add a little nostril on the  front  oh and one more shape back here we're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5169199,5174400,just going to draw an oval behind the  eye  all right now we're ready to draw the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5174400,5179440,neck and also the body we'll start here  and we're going to curve  back
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5179440,5186080,and down  it has hair now yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5186080,5191120,it does look like there now let's draw  the front of the neck we're going to  draw another curve that comes down like
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5191120,5196880,this  and then right at the end we're going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5196880,5202719,draw a little bump for the chest  now we're going to draw the really
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5202719,5208080,strong arms we're going to start inside  of the body come down like this and then
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5208080,5215120,forward it looks like a backwards l  then we're going to draw the first claw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5215120,5220320,on the front  arms we're going to come down like this  really far and then we're going to curve
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5220320,5227920,back up  and dominus rex had these crazy scary  claws like tyrannosaurus rex has really
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5227920,5233280,small arms but because this is uh  combined with a raptor it has longer
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5233280,5238480,arms probably really fast too yeah it  was really fast then we're going to draw  another curve
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5238480,5245040,that comes down and then back up for the  other claw and then we're going to do  another one over here on the front
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5245040,5250239,if you need extra time remember you can  always pause the video you can even  rewind the video if you want to see the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5250239,5256880,step over again  okay let's draw the rest of the arm  coming back like this
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5256880,5261599,and then we're gonna curve up into the  body
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5262400,5269120,cool all right now let's draw the rest  of the belly we're gonna come back  so right here see the chest line it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5269120,5275679,comes here connects to the arm we're  gonna imagine it going behind the arm  and then coming back
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5275679,5282320,okay now let's draw the really strong  back legs we're gonna start up high  and we're going to come down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5282320,5285440,and then curve back
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5287679,5293920,this is the knee  a humongous knee humongous yeah then  we're going to draw the start of the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5293920,5300239,foot coming down further  and we're going to draw the first toe  it's really big we're going to come
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5300239,5307719,forward  then we're going to curve down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5308000,5313120,then back up make sure it's really sharp  that's for the first claw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5313120,5318480,and then we're gonna come back further  now we're gonna draw another toe right
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5318480,5323840,here we're gonna start up higher  come down and curve
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5324719,5330000,and then we're going to curve back up  looks like an another v with a curve at
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5330000,5336159,the bottom i'm trying to concentrate  you're doing a great job handling i love  your drawing so much now let's draw the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5336159,5342960,other toe on the other side we're going  to come forward  i know this one's challenging isn't it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5342960,5349199,this is probably one of the more  detailed drawings you've ever done yeah  you're doing such a great job okay we're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5349199,5354239,going to curve back up and then connect  to the toe  all right we got all of the toes for the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5354239,5359440,first foot now we're going to start here  and we're going to curve up to i think
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5359440,5365360,this is like an ankle  it's really high really high yeah then
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5365360,5371520,we're gonna curve  this is the rest of the lake coming back  and we're gonna draw a big muscle back
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5371520,5377440,here  that's what keeps his legs together yes
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5377440,5384080,next we're going to start right here at  the back of the neck and we're going to  draw the body coming up and over the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5384080,5390400,back leg  i wish we had a lot more room for paper  coming off to the side but we're going
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5390400,5396480,to bend the tail around  cool  yes just like that then we're gonna draw
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5396480,5401679,the rest of the tail or the start of the  tail we're gonna curve around  like this and then we're gonna come
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5401679,5410080,forward oh wow that's because we don't  have enough room otherwise we just have  draw it straight out of the back
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5410639,5416639,yes looks like his tail is going like  this  let's draw the other side of the tail by
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5416639,5422560,starting down here we're going to  imagine the belly line going behind the  leg  coming around and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5422560,5427840,watch as i get closer to the end of the  tail  i'm getting closer
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5427840,5433480,to the other side of the tail until it  makes a point
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5434560,5440400,good job all right  skinny right there that's okay i like it  what's our dinosaur missing his other
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5440400,5447520,foot yeah other foot and leg let's start  here right behind the front arm and  we're going to draw line that curves
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5447520,5452880,down and then forward  we're going to draw the legs kind of
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5452880,5458719,spread apart so that it doesn't look  like our dinosaur is going to tip over  we're going to draw that first toe and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5458719,5463840,we're just repeating the same steps that  we did over here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5464159,5469600,then we're going to draw the curve for  the talon or the claw  and we're going to curve back up and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5469600,5474639,then come  back for that toe  now let's draw the other toe right here
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5474639,5479920,we're going to draw a v-shape comes back  up down and up
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5479920,5485360,now we're going to draw the other toe  coming forward  curve down
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5485360,5492400,back up and then into the toe  now let's draw the rest of the leg we're
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5492400,5499120,going to curve up  to draw the ankle on the end and then  connect into the body
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5500320,5507840,now we're ready to draw the other arm  let's start right here draw a line down  and then out
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5509280,5515040,and then we're going to repeat these  same steps too we're going to draw a  curve for the first claw and then back
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5515040,5520639,up  oh that's a big claw i like it the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5520639,5526400,bigger the scarier then we're going to  draw another clot next to it
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5527040,5533120,and on this side you can see the thumb  so we're going to draw another  curved v but this time we're going to
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5533120,5536400,curve the other direction
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5538719,5544159,now let's draw the rest of the arm  coming down and then bend up and connect
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5544159,5549840,to the body  and we could also draw another curve for
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5549840,5556480,the other claw  now we need to add more details to make
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5556480,5561920,them look even more like indominus rex  well let's draw these spikes there's a
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5561920,5568960,lot of spikes that came back off of its  neck  so we're going to draw little spikes and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5568960,5576159,i started really big and then drew two  more that are smaller i couldn't even go  further down the neck
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5578639,5584480,ah let's even draw let's draw even more  spikes coming down the back
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5584480,5592239,there's a lot of spikes yeah and we can  even draw more on the neck  inside of the neck
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5594400,5600159,i'm going to draw a couple more on this  side too  now it looks even more like him
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5600159,5605920,i'm going to add even more spikes going  down the body  i think this was one of the coolest
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5605920,5611040,parts  about an on indominus rex
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5614800,5621360,don't know how to say it very well  indominus  i think there's also some spikes on the
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5621360,5626719,arm  so we're going to draw some i'm starting  really small and then as i go back get
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5626719,5631840,bigger i'm going to draw them on the  other arm too
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5632960,5638480,hadley we did it we finished drawing  indominus rex  this part we're going to fast forward
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5638480,5646840,but at the end you can pause the video  to match our same coloring you ready to  fast forward yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5650510,5658459,[Music]
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5663760,5668800,hadley give me five we did it we  finished coloring indominus rex it looks
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5668800,5675520,really awesome  now we used our biannual markers to  color our dinosaurs we only used three
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5675520,5683280,colors two grays what were these colors  in case our art friends have the same  brand yeah so the light one is wg05 yeah
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5683280,5689840,that's this one  and the darker gray is wg07  yeah and we use that for shading now we
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5689840,5696560,use the w grays because they're warmer  and i thought that would look really  cool on a dinosaur to have warm gray and
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5696560,5701600,there was the red we used for the mouth  it was r218 we also used our white
bt_FD-h3Gqw,5701600,5708400,prismacolor colored pencil to add  highlights on the skin to make it look a  little more 3d yeah we hope you had a
