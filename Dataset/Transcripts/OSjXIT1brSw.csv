OSjXIT1brSw,4713,6548,"- Hey, Pat, Dennis is here early,"
OSjXIT1brSw,6548,7464,so we're gonna meet now.
OSjXIT1brSw,7465,8341,- But it's lunch.
OSjXIT1brSw,8341,9342,- We pushed lunch to 1:30
OSjXIT1brSw,9342,11427,so Dennis could make the flight to Chicago.
OSjXIT1brSw,11428,13221,"- Oh, 1:30?"
OSjXIT1brSw,13221,14723,But it's lunch.
OSjXIT1brSw,14723,15556,- Yeah.
OSjXIT1brSw,19436,21938,- I don't know if you're allowed to do that.
OSjXIT1brSw,26568,28403,"- All right, I'll jump right into it."
OSjXIT1brSw,28403,30321,I Have to be in a cab in 20 minutes.
OSjXIT1brSw,30321,32698,The first and most obvious thing that we should address
OSjXIT1brSw,32699,36286,is the team restructuring now that Sierra got headhunted.
OSjXIT1brSw,36286,41249,"Now, 70% to 75% of corporate workplace transformations fail."
OSjXIT1brSw,41249,44044,And what's at the heart of those failures?
OSjXIT1brSw,44044,46378,The dreaded reorg.
OSjXIT1brSw,46379,48256,"I've been in this business for years,"
OSjXIT1brSw,48256,50550,"and in my observation,"
OSjXIT1brSw,50550,54179,"time and time again after losing a team leader,"
OSjXIT1brSw,54179,56181,people begin to tune out.
OSjXIT1brSw,56181,58725,They move in to a protectionist mode.
OSjXIT1brSw,58725,60934,"Let's be really, really clear."
OSjXIT1brSw,60935,63354,Trying to shuffle other team members
OSjXIT1brSw,63354,65398,around willy-nilly isn't gonna work.
OSjXIT1brSw,65398,68777,That just creates patterns of dysfunctional communication.
OSjXIT1brSw,68777,69611,- Is that a hot dog?
OSjXIT1brSw,69611,72155,- Find ourselves facing another restructuring...
OSjXIT1brSw,72155,72989,- Pat!
OSjXIT1brSw,73907,74741,Pat!
OSjXIT1brSw,75784,77243,Is that a hot dog in your sleeve?
OSjXIT1brSw,77243,79036,- Re-evaluate the specific elements
OSjXIT1brSw,79037,80830,that Sierra brought to the table...
OSjXIT1brSw,80830,82165,- I'm so tired.
OSjXIT1brSw,82165,83875,"- And if we pull this off,"
OSjXIT1brSw,83875,86503,our leverage initiative can not only
OSjXIT1brSw,86503,89130,"recreate the success we enjoyed with her at the helm,"
OSjXIT1brSw,89130,90340,but surpass it.
OSjXIT1brSw,93885,94719,Pat.
OSjXIT1brSw,95929,97972,- He's eating a hot dog.
OSjXIT1brSw,97972,98807,- What?
OSjXIT1brSw,98807,100391,- He's eating a hot dog under there.
OSjXIT1brSw,100391,103019,"- Pat, we know you're eating a hot dog."
OSjXIT1brSw,103019,104437,"- I'm not, sir."
OSjXIT1brSw,104437,107648,"I'm just, like, the tiredest I've ever been in my life."
OSjXIT1brSw,108608,110026,- You can see it from here
OSjXIT1brSw,110026,111236,- Fuck.
OSjXIT1brSw,115448,116282,- Pat?
OSjXIT1brSw,121704,123915,Pat is choking! - Stop moving!
OSjXIT1brSw,123915,124749,Stop!
OSjXIT1brSw,124749,125959,- Stop! - Stop moving!
OSjXIT1brSw,125959,128294,- He's like a wild animal.
OSjXIT1brSw,128294,130797,"- Hold still, Pat. - Don't let it break off."
OSjXIT1brSw,130797,131756,There's no way to suck it out.
OSjXIT1brSw,131756,133216,- Don't pinch the end.
OSjXIT1brSw,133216,134509,- He's trying to choke me.
OSjXIT1brSw,134509,137137,He's trying to kill me.
OSjXIT1brSw,142559,145603,- You can't skip lunch.
OSjXIT1brSw,145603,147188,"You just can't, guys."
OSjXIT1brSw,148439,149566,Whose bag's this?
OSjXIT1brSw,151317,152777,I almost tripped on it.
OSjXIT1brSw,153319,155071,- So do you like it out here?
OSjXIT1brSw,155071,157031,"- You know, coming from the Midwest,"
OSjXIT1brSw,157031,159325,I was unsure whether I'd like California or not.
OSjXIT1brSw,159325,161452,"- Yeah. - But I got to say, I love it."
OSjXIT1brSw,161452,163621,"You know, the weather, obviously."
OSjXIT1brSw,163621,164455,- Mm-hm.
OSjXIT1brSw,164455,165999,- It doesn't get any better.
OSjXIT1brSw,165999,167709,And you think I'd miss the seasons...
OSjXIT1brSw,167709,168877,- Mm-hm.
OSjXIT1brSw,168877,170170,- But you know what?
OSjXIT1brSw,170170,173214,"Sometimes I do, but most of the time, I don't."
OSjXIT1brSw,175091,175925,- You excuse me for a second?
OSjXIT1brSw,175925,176759,- Mm-hm.
OSjXIT1brSw,179804,181848,"- Excuse me, can I talk to you for a second?"
OSjXIT1brSw,181848,182724,- How can I help you?
OSjXIT1brSw,182724,185351,- My date's eating all the fully loaded nachos.
OSjXIT1brSw,185351,186936,"All the ones with the meat and cheese and everything,"
OSjXIT1brSw,186936,189314,"the ones that are fully loaded, she's hogging them,"
OSjXIT1brSw,189314,191983,"so I'm mostly getting just, like, just chips."
OSjXIT1brSw,191983,194986,"Like mostly just chips, like nothing on 'em,"
OSjXIT1brSw,194986,196112,"but, like, a little bit of cheese"
OSjXIT1brSw,196112,198239,and maybe one little nugget of meat.
OSjXIT1brSw,198239,199073,- Okay.
OSjXIT1brSw,199073,200533,- Can you say something to her?
OSjXIT1brSw,201409,202243,- Say what?
OSjXIT1brSw,202243,203328,- Maybe go up to the table
OSjXIT1brSw,203328,205413,"and just say like, ""Hey, stop that."""
OSjXIT1brSw,205413,209000,"Or like, ""Hey, that's not allowed."""
OSjXIT1brSw,209000,209918,"- You want me to go over and say,"
OSjXIT1brSw,209918,211127,"""Stop eating the meat on the chips""?"
OSjXIT1brSw,211127,213588,"- No, just say the restaurant has a rule."
OSjXIT1brSw,213588,217133,"It's not you, it's a rule the restaurant has"
OSjXIT1brSw,217133,220386,"that if you get an item to share, you can't..."
OSjXIT1brSw,220386,223932,One person can't just eat all the fully loaded ones.
OSjXIT1brSw,223932,226893,"Like, don't look around, find the one with most meat,"
OSjXIT1brSw,226893,228770,and always eat that one.
OSjXIT1brSw,228770,229771,- Can't you just ask her to share with you?
OSjXIT1brSw,229771,232148,- Can't you just say the restaurant has a rule?
OSjXIT1brSw,233483,235235,"- I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I'm like,"
OSjXIT1brSw,235235,236361,"""Play your hits."
OSjXIT1brSw,236361,238446,"Like, don't play the new stuff."""
OSjXIT1brSw,238446,240156,"- Yeah, I totally agree."
OSjXIT1brSw,240156,240990,"You go to a concert,"
OSjXIT1brSw,240990,242992,and you want to hear the songs you love.
OSjXIT1brSw,242992,243826,"- Right, exactly, like--"
OSjXIT1brSw,243826,244661,- Give me the good-time rock 'n' roll.
OSjXIT1brSw,244661,246913,"- I want to sing along! - Yeah, totally!"
OSjXIT1brSw,248456,249749,- This is really fun. - This is so fun.
OSjXIT1brSw,249749,251042,- I'm glad we did this.
OSjXIT1brSw,252001,252877,- Are you enjoying everything?
OSjXIT1brSw,252877,254545,"- Mm-hmm. - Yeah, everything's great."
OSjXIT1brSw,254545,255588,- Yeah.
OSjXIT1brSw,255588,256881,"- Uh, okay."
OSjXIT1brSw,257840,258924,Because we have a rule here
OSjXIT1brSw,258924,261177,"that if you order nachos to share,"
OSjXIT1brSw,261177,265098,"uh, one person can't just eat all the fully loaded nachos."
OSjXIT1brSw,269644,271145,"- What's that, say that again?"
OSjXIT1brSw,273147,275858,- We have a rule that basically says
OSjXIT1brSw,275858,278695,if two people order nachos to share...
OSjXIT1brSw,278695,282323,one person can't take the ones with meat and stuff.
OSjXIT1brSw,282323,284784,"- What, I've never heard anything like that before."
OSjXIT1brSw,284784,287537,That is so weird.
OSjXIT1brSw,287537,289831,"But I guess if that's a rule, thanks."
OSjXIT1brSw,289831,291124,- Okay. - Hang on a second.
OSjXIT1brSw,294502,296879,Did you ask him to come over here and say that?
OSjXIT1brSw,304971,306180,- What?
OSjXIT1brSw,306180,307764,- Did you ask him to say that?
OSjXIT1brSw,314147,317442,- What the hell are you talking about?
OSjXIT1brSw,317442,320987,"- You got up, you talked to him for a long time,"
OSjXIT1brSw,320987,324115,"and then the minute you sit down, he comes over"
OSjXIT1brSw,324115,326284,and says that the restaurant has this rule.
OSjXIT1brSw,327327,330163,No restaurant has a rule about who gets to eat what.
OSjXIT1brSw,336336,337920,- What?
OSjXIT1brSw,337920,342216,I went up there to ask if we could switch tables.
OSjXIT1brSw,342216,344886,"There's an air conditioner above this table,"
OSjXIT1brSw,344886,348598,and I was worried you were gonna get cold.
OSjXIT1brSw,348598,350932,- There's no vent above us.
OSjXIT1brSw,350933,352226,- What?
OSjXIT1brSw,352226,354437,- Did he ask you to come over and say that about the nachos?
OSjXIT1brSw,354437,355521,- He did. - What?
OSjXIT1brSw,356689,360526,I went up there to complain about the rule.
OSjXIT1brSw,360526,363154,- You just learned the rule! - What?
OSjXIT1brSw,363154,365198,- He just came over here... - Who?
OSjXIT1brSw,365198,366366,- Him!
OSjXIT1brSw,366366,368117,- What is going on?
OSjXIT1brSw,368117,369243,- We'll take the check.
OSjXIT1brSw,372872,375458,- We're gonna be so early for that movie.
OSjXIT1brSw,375458,377877,- I'm not going to the movie.
OSjXIT1brSw,379962,380671,- What?
OSjXIT1brSw,380797,381798,"- And then, I checked Instagram"
OSjXIT1brSw,381798,383758,and I see an ad for Graham crackers.
OSjXIT1brSw,383758,384592,- Ah!
OSjXIT1brSw,384592,386386,- These things are spying on us.
OSjXIT1brSw,386386,387387,"- Yeah, go ahead and spy on me."
OSjXIT1brSw,387387,390181,You're going to see me drink too much wine
OSjXIT1brSw,390181,391766,"and watch too much ""Scandal."""
OSjXIT1brSw,394102,395311,- I am so glad you could come out
OSjXIT1brSw,395311,397271,"with us tonight, Professor Yurabay."
OSjXIT1brSw,397271,400400,- Getting to see what you go on to do after graduation
OSjXIT1brSw,400400,402735,is one of my favorite parts of teaching.
OSjXIT1brSw,402735,404278,"- I mean, your class at business school"
OSjXIT1brSw,404278,406322,is the reason we're not just pluggin' away at a hedge fund
OSjXIT1brSw,406322,408949,and we're doing what we think is important.
OSjXIT1brSw,408950,409992,- Cheers. - Cheers.
OSjXIT1brSw,411160,413204,- So tell me more about this new job.
OSjXIT1brSw,413204,414080,"- Oh, it's great."
OSjXIT1brSw,414080,415498,We're in the Amstar building.
OSjXIT1brSw,415498,417125,- And here we go.
OSjXIT1brSw,417125,418626,"- All right. - Oh, thank you."
OSjXIT1brSw,420253,422004,"- Look at that, who got that?"
OSjXIT1brSw,422004,422839,- That's mine.
OSjXIT1brSw,422839,425675,"- Dylan, that looks really good."
OSjXIT1brSw,425675,426759,- I should've got that.
OSjXIT1brSw,428428,430513,"- Yeah, so everything's going really great."
OSjXIT1brSw,430513,432223,There's this one woman on my team
OSjXIT1brSw,432223,433766,that's driving me a little crazy.
OSjXIT1brSw,433766,436393,- What's her deal? - She's just a micromanager.
OSjXIT1brSw,436394,438813,"So every time I'm making a deck, she's saying,"
OSjXIT1brSw,438813,440147,"""I wouldn't have made it that way."""
OSjXIT1brSw,440148,441649,- I should've got that.
OSjXIT1brSw,441649,444526,- Have you tried at all to talk to her about your issues?
OSjXIT1brSw,444527,446946,"- Dylan, look over there."
OSjXIT1brSw,448239,450658,"I'm joking, I'm joking."
OSjXIT1brSw,457540,458666,Give me that.
OSjXIT1brSw,458666,461043,- What? - Give me that.
OSjXIT1brSw,461043,461961,- My food?
OSjXIT1brSw,461961,462795,- I'm joking.
OSjXIT1brSw,464130,464964,I'm joking.
OSjXIT1brSw,467383,469051,- Enough about my drama.
OSjXIT1brSw,469051,470178,"Dylan, how are your kids?"
OSjXIT1brSw,470178,473222,"- They're a handful, of course, but we have the au pair,"
OSjXIT1brSw,473222,475016,"and Susan is working part-time right now,"
OSjXIT1brSw,475016,476350,so that really helps.
OSjXIT1brSw,489864,491782,"I'm joking, I'm joking."
OSjXIT1brSw,493201,495535,"- Professor, do you want a bite of mine?"
OSjXIT1brSw,495536,498414,"- Yeah, I actually would like to try."
OSjXIT1brSw,498414,499749,"- Yeah, sure."
OSjXIT1brSw,499749,501209,"- Uh, come here."
OSjXIT1brSw,502960,506464,"- Yeah, so, Brenda is four-and-a-half, Taylor is three,"
OSjXIT1brSw,506464,509258,and they're into art right now.
OSjXIT1brSw,509258,510468,"- Mmm. - Dylan,"
OSjXIT1brSw,511844,513471,I'm going to eat the whole thing.
OSjXIT1brSw,536911,540373,"- It's, uh, it's so weird to imagine you as a dad."
OSjXIT1brSw,540373,542542,- Are you going to tell people I did that?
OSjXIT1brSw,542542,543376,- Hmm?
OSjXIT1brSw,543376,545044,- That I housed Dylan's burger.
OSjXIT1brSw,546379,548214,- We're not gonna say anything.
OSjXIT1brSw,548214,550174,"You didn't like your meal, it's no big deal."
OSjXIT1brSw,550174,551384,- Let me take a video of you
OSjXIT1brSw,551384,553134,saying that you're going to kill the president.
OSjXIT1brSw,553135,555137,- What? - It's no big deal.
OSjXIT1brSw,555137,558975,"No one's ever going to see it, unless I hear the story"
OSjXIT1brSw,558975,561185,of me housing Dylan's burger down
OSjXIT1brSw,561185,562979,at Graham's Lorelai Lounge.
OSjXIT1brSw,562979,564272,- We're not saying that. - Saying what?
OSjXIT1brSw,564272,565855,- That we're gonna kill the president.
OSjXIT1brSw,565856,566941,"- Oh, shit. Say it again."
OSjXIT1brSw,566941,568651,"- Oh my god, what is wrong with you?"
OSjXIT1brSw,568651,569485,"- I tried to get a video,"
OSjXIT1brSw,569485,571404,but I couldn't flip the thing fast enough.
OSjXIT1brSw,571404,572822,"- You know, we were really looking forward"
OSjXIT1brSw,572822,574240,to seeing you tonight.
OSjXIT1brSw,574240,577326,"We look up to you so much, but right now,"
OSjXIT1brSw,577326,579495,I don't even know what to think.
OSjXIT1brSw,579495,583332,"- The truth is, I may look like I have it all,"
OSjXIT1brSw,583332,587211,"but inside, I'm just a scared little boy"
OSjXIT1brSw,587211,589714,who never learned how to ask
OSjXIT1brSw,589714,592216,for people's food or their burger.
OSjXIT1brSw,592216,595011,And the thing that scares me the most
OSjXIT1brSw,595011,599015,"is that if people found out, my wife would go to jail"
OSjXIT1brSw,599890,600891,"'cause every night,"
OSjXIT1brSw,603686,606355,a little boy goes down on her.
OSjXIT1brSw,606355,608107,"- Oh, fuck! - Jesus."
OSjXIT1brSw,608107,608691,- Christ!
OSjXIT1brSw,610067,611777,"- Hey, what's up, dude? - Hey, what's good, man?"
OSjXIT1brSw,611777,613946,- How are you? - I'm good.
OSjXIT1brSw,615615,617158,"Oh, my God."
OSjXIT1brSw,617158,619535,Is that Caleb Went?
OSjXIT1brSw,619535,621412,"- Yeah, it's kind of nuts, right?"
OSjXIT1brSw,621412,623164,He and Dane are buddies.
OSjXIT1brSw,623164,625333,- Dane's friends with Caleb Went?
OSjXIT1brSw,625333,626375,- Mm-hm.
OSjXIT1brSw,626375,629337,"- Um, okay."
OSjXIT1brSw,630546,632423,"Dude, I am such a big fan"
OSjXIT1brSw,632423,634717,of his Angels and Archways clothing.
OSjXIT1brSw,634717,637053,"My belt right now, it's a studded leather belt"
OSjXIT1brSw,637053,638721,that's from Angels and Archways.
OSjXIT1brSw,638721,639805,"- Okay, chill out, dude."
OSjXIT1brSw,639805,640765,- I'm chill.
OSjXIT1brSw,640765,644769,"I'm just, like, such a huge fan of his music and his acting."
