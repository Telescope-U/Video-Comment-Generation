n-sjljn2dNw,2480,11113,What's my name jon snow and why is my surname  snow because you're a bastard from the north
n-sjljn2dNw,23280,25360,love is the death of duty
n-sjljn2dNw,28080,32320,in every man's life there  comes a day when he must choose
n-sjljn2dNw,36320,37760,i did what i thought was right
n-sjljn2dNw,41120,43840,and i got murdered for it
n-sjljn2dNw,46640,53650,kill the boy jon snow and let the man be born
n-sjljn2dNw,58800,64080,Welcome back everyone hbo just announced a jon  snow game of thrones sequels series so i'll  
n-sjljn2dNw,64080,68160,explain what's going on because you haven't just  stepped into a time machine but this is basically  
n-sjljn2dNw,68160,72000,their best chance to correct a lot of the  issues with game of thrones season 8 the people  
n-sjljn2dNw,72000,75520,had so for those of you posting all the memes  about them re-shooting game of thrones season  
n-sjljn2dNw,75520,79920,8 this is kind of their way of doing something  similar of course i'll be doing episode videos  
n-sjljn2dNw,79920,84880,for it when it releases so be sure to subscribe to  get everything this is in addition to the house of  
n-sjljn2dNw,84880,88960,the dragon episodes which are starting in august  later this year i'll be doing full episode videos  
n-sjljn2dNw,88960,92720,for that too just like i did for the classic  game of thrones series the big difference is  
n-sjljn2dNw,92720,97600,that house of the dragon takes place around 200  years earlier in the timeline so it's a prequel  
n-sjljn2dNw,97600,101840,based on the fire and blood targaryen history  book it's about the huge targaryen civil war  
n-sjljn2dNw,101840,105359,called the dance of the dragons when there  were tons of dragons all over westeros  
n-sjljn2dNw,105360,110000,the jon snow game of thrones sequel series will  take place after the events of game of thrones  
n-sjljn2dNw,110000,115200,season 8 after jon snow left to go north of the  wall with the wildlings tormund and ghost so as  
n-sjljn2dNw,115200,119840,of right now them announcing that this jon snow  sequel is actually happening with kit harrington  
n-sjljn2dNw,119840,124000,there are many game of thrones spin off sequels  and prequel shows they're doing but only some of  
n-sjljn2dNw,124000,128080,those will wind up actually turning into episodes  that we'll actually be able to watch on television  
n-sjljn2dNw,128080,131920,house of the dragon is just the first one that's  made into actual episodes that we'll be able to  
n-sjljn2dNw,131920,136319,watch soon i will explain all the other shows that  they're working on later in the video and i know a  
n-sjljn2dNw,136320,140800,lot of you are also asking if this affects kid  harrington playing the black knight for marvel  
n-sjljn2dNw,140800,145680,inside the turtles movies inside midnight suns  and any other big crossovers with avengers 5. i  
n-sjljn2dNw,145680,149359,will address that later in the video too the big  thing that i think a lot of people are confused  
n-sjljn2dNw,149360,154240,about is that dan and dave are not involved with  any game of thrones anything anymore so just  
n-sjljn2dNw,154240,158560,because hbo is doing a sequel doesn't mean that  dan and dave are coming back if you did not like  
n-sjljn2dNw,158560,162319,what they did with the show especially towards  the last couple of seasons don't worry they are  
n-sjljn2dNw,162320,166480,not involved with anything creatively or anything  like that one of the big things that they didn't  
n-sjljn2dNw,166480,170159,do from the books that they could always introduce  during the show one new twist with his character  
n-sjljn2dNw,170160,175600,is the idea of his wolf dreams and being a warg  in the books all the stark children who still  
n-sjljn2dNw,175600,180400,have dire wolves that continue living throughout  the series continue to have wolf dreams which is a  
n-sjljn2dNw,180400,184879,version of working like their low level warging  without realizing it you mostly see this play  
n-sjljn2dNw,184880,188640,out through arya's storyline because she sees  visions of nymeria running around through the  
n-sjljn2dNw,188640,193280,woods feeling like she is nymeria running around  through the woods so when people make jokes about  
n-sjljn2dNw,193280,197280,jon snow having a wolf brain that's what they're  talking about like him actually being a warg  
n-sjljn2dNw,197280,201920,it's just the tv show never bothered to do that  when the original show ended kid harrington and  
n-sjljn2dNw,201920,205280,the other main cast members were kind of iffy  about coming back as their characters because  
n-sjljn2dNw,205280,209200,everybody did ask them are you all coming back  for sequels and they're like well we don't know  
n-sjljn2dNw,209200,213200,right after season 8 finished the only one who  was like definitely i will come back was maisie  
n-sjljn2dNw,213200,218319,williams coming back as a version of arya she  actually just filmed new scenes as arya for warner  
n-sjljn2dNw,218320,222720,brothers as part of their big multiverses game  that's not meant to be canon to a song of ice and  
n-sjljn2dNw,222720,226800,fire or game of thrones that's like a completely  separate game based on all the iep that warner  
n-sjljn2dNw,226800,231360,brothers owns so that's how you have arya from  game of thrones interacting with dc comic book  
n-sjljn2dNw,231360,237280,characters this game of thrones sequel series is  legit kit harrington coming back as jon snow after  
n-sjljn2dNw,237280,241840,the events of season 8 to just continue the story  for at least his character now they haven't been  
n-sjljn2dNw,241840,246160,totally clear on exactly how much they're going  to cover in the show like is this going to be  
n-sjljn2dNw,246160,250080,a better call saul kind of sequel series even  though that's meant to be a prequel like well  
n-sjljn2dNw,250080,254640,it just focused on a specific group of characters  and have cameos from people from the original show  
n-sjljn2dNw,254640,258640,or will it be the breaking bad movie where it's  more of a one-off mini-series kind of thing  
n-sjljn2dNw,258640,262720,set after the events of the previous story  but i did a bunch of videos after the season 8  
n-sjljn2dNw,262720,267520,finale aired for all the deleted scenes and these  alternate endings alternate storylines that they  
n-sjljn2dNw,267520,271360,cut from the finale so i'll link that below in the  comments and at the end of this so you can learn  
n-sjljn2dNw,271360,276000,about everything that would have happened but  the game of thrones sequel series will take place  
n-sjljn2dNw,276000,280800,a little while after jon snow went north past  the wall the big thing in the kingdom right now  
n-sjljn2dNw,280800,284800,is that the wildlings with jon snow ghosts have  gone back beyond the wall and even though they've  
n-sjljn2dNw,284800,288560,defeated the night king and therefore killed all  the white walkers the whites that they raised  
n-sjljn2dNw,288560,293040,there's no more need for the actual wall like it  serves no actual purpose anymore originally it was  
n-sjljn2dNw,293040,297840,created 8 000 years ago after the first long night  with the combined help of bran the builder who at  
n-sjljn2dNw,297840,302880,the time was king of the north he was the stark's  ancestor he wasn't secretly the three-eyed raven  
n-sjljn2dNw,302880,306960,version of bran time traveling with his powers  there were all kinds of crazy theories about that  
n-sjljn2dNw,306960,310400,bran the builder was meant to be a completely  different character that was an ancestor to  
n-sjljn2dNw,310400,315120,these modern day characters who bran and all of  his predecessors with the same name were named  
n-sjljn2dNw,315120,319360,for he built the wall with the combined help of  the children of the forest and the giants at that  
n-sjljn2dNw,319360,323520,time and the children of the forest were the ones  who created the special magical enchantments on  
n-sjljn2dNw,323520,327199,the wall that prevented the white walkers and the  night king from passing through it the exception  
n-sjljn2dNw,327200,331440,to that during game of thrones season one because  there is a big twist with whites in castle black  
n-sjljn2dNw,331440,335200,is that they could carry the bodies that had  been turned into whites past the barrier through  
n-sjljn2dNw,335200,340000,the gate of castle black themselves and then they  reanimated once they were past the wall but before  
n-sjljn2dNw,340000,344400,the night king had turned viserion into the dragon  white he didn't have enough power to bring down  
n-sjljn2dNw,344400,348800,the wall or get past the enchantments on the show  the big difference is they condensed the timeline  
n-sjljn2dNw,348800,352639,so instead of the long night being like many  thousands of years ago it was closer to being  
n-sjljn2dNw,352640,357440,a thousand years ago still a long time but not  nearly as long eventually hundreds of years later  
n-sjljn2dNw,357440,361440,what wound up happening is that people in the  seven kingdoms just forgot what the wall was about  
n-sjljn2dNw,361440,365120,they forgot about the threat of the white walkers  and they started to believe that the wall had  
n-sjljn2dNw,365120,370240,been created to keep the free folk away from the  seven kingdoms but now in present day three-eyed  
n-sjljn2dNw,370240,374800,raven bran has become king of the seven kingdoms  samwell is his grand maester tyrion is his hand  
n-sjljn2dNw,374800,379199,of the king the way they portrayed things is the  realm has been to be kind of torn on what he did  
n-sjljn2dNw,379200,383680,killing daenerys like some of the realms supported  jon snow and some of them supported daenerys but  
n-sjljn2dNw,383680,387919,even though jon snow still technically has a claim  to the iron throne the great council that they  
n-sjljn2dNw,387920,393840,formed in this finale scene basically chose bran  to be their new king so the realm supports bran as  
n-sjljn2dNw,393840,398560,king but after the fact after this all plays out  he's portrayed as kind of a controversial figure  
n-sjljn2dNw,398560,402720,of legend amongst people in the seven kingdoms  but everybody pretty much knows that he went  
n-sjljn2dNw,402720,407040,north of the wall and outside of his sister sansa  who's ruling over winterfell in the north really  
n-sjljn2dNw,407040,412160,close by no one else is really worried about jon  snow that much like no one's really thinking about  
n-sjljn2dNw,412160,416160,what's going on with the wildlings because they're  not even that large of a group and even bran who  
n-sjljn2dNw,416160,420720,you think would be concerned about his brother jon  snow is more like a human turnip like a repository  
n-sjljn2dNw,420720,426560,for all of history so his personality is more like  an ai he just spits out facts and details about  
n-sjljn2dNw,426560,431120,things from across history anytime you try to  talk to him inaria has still left westeros to go  
n-sjljn2dNw,431120,436720,to the western continent on the other side of the  sunset sea to just explore what's west of westeros  
n-sjljn2dNw,436720,440880,gendry is now lord of the stormlands and if it  wasn't clear obviously jon snow is leading the  
n-sjljn2dNw,440880,444720,free folk tormund is kind of like his second in  command but a lot of you are asking who's going  
n-sjljn2dNw,444720,448400,to be the main villain of this show if it's going  to be centered on jon snow like what's the central  
n-sjljn2dNw,448400,452800,conflict if they defeated the night king the white  walkers all the whites the undead minions and the  
n-sjljn2dNw,452800,456960,animals they raised well they haven't said if this  is only going to take place up in the north beyond  
n-sjljn2dNw,456960,461280,the wall or if it'll be like a big sprawling  political thriller the way the first show was  
n-sjljn2dNw,461280,465200,in a lot of the villain will just depend on the  geography of the show like where it actually  
n-sjljn2dNw,465200,469520,takes place if it's localized to just north of the  wall it's going to be very different but like now  
n-sjljn2dNw,469520,473680,in present day because there's no more night king  there are no more spiders biggest hounds there are  
n-sjljn2dNw,473680,478560,still a couple groups in the world of essos that  hate the seven kingdoms in general and hate jon  
n-sjljn2dNw,478560,483360,snow for killing daenerys so like he's still hated  by a lot of people around the world and there's  
n-sjljn2dNw,483360,488159,further internal conflict civil war brewing  between different kingdoms inside westeros like  
n-sjljn2dNw,488160,492800,just because they beat the night king beat cersei  everyone went home doesn't mean that everyone in  
n-sjljn2dNw,492800,497120,westeros and essos now love each other one of  the big themes in george r martin's the song of  
n-sjljn2dNw,497120,501760,ice and fire series is that time plays out in a  circular nature like events always have a way of  
n-sjljn2dNw,501760,506320,repeating themselves people always make the same  types of mistakes they haven't confirmed everybody  
n-sjljn2dNw,506320,511360,that's coming back for the show like sophie turner  would probably come back because winterfell is  
n-sjljn2dNw,511360,515519,right there next door south of the wall it would  be weird for them to do this whole ass show about  
n-sjljn2dNw,515520,519520,jon snow for five seasons and to not show you  what's happening at winterfell or any of the  
n-sjljn2dNw,519520,525120,other seven kingdoms so i believe better call saul  style they will try to feature people from the  
n-sjljn2dNw,525120,529920,original cast the biggest antagonists left alive  at the end of the main show were the forces of  
n-sjljn2dNw,529920,535680,slavers bay the iron bank who really really wants  their money back now they lost a ton of money  
n-sjljn2dNw,535680,540480,to cersei after giving her even more loans that  she had initially paid back during season seven  
n-sjljn2dNw,540480,544560,like she paid back the first loan using the  tyrell's gold that they had stolen from the reach  
n-sjljn2dNw,544560,549120,right after they paid that loan back with  that gold they gave her another large new loan  
n-sjljn2dNw,549120,554720,that she used to hire the golden company which  were promptly melted by cersei in drogon they  
n-sjljn2dNw,554720,559360,lasted for like five seconds during that battle if  you can call it a battle it was more of a massacre  
n-sjljn2dNw,559360,563120,there's all the forces of the free cities there's  what's left of the dothraki the rest of the  
n-sjljn2dNw,563120,567360,unsullied even though grey worm implied at the end  of the main show that he was taking the unsullied  
n-sjljn2dNw,567360,572160,or what remained of them to noth the island where  missandei originally came from in the summer isles  
n-sjljn2dNw,572160,576160,in the dothraki seemed like they were eventually  going back to essos but there are many forces  
n-sjljn2dNw,576160,580560,inside westeros and inside essos that want  revenge for something that happened during  
n-sjljn2dNw,580560,584400,the events of the main show and there are a lot  of other kingdoms that they didn't feature during  
n-sjljn2dNw,584400,588960,the main show like other places in essos we didn't  go or didn't see a lot of really good example is  
n-sjljn2dNw,588960,593520,the forces of asshai in the shadow lance that's  the place where melisandre originally came from  
n-sjljn2dNw,593520,597760,because they just announced they started working  on this jon snow sequel series they probably  
n-sjljn2dNw,597760,602400,wouldn't have episodes ready till at least 2025  if they run it concurrently with the house of the  
n-sjljn2dNw,602400,607280,dragon episodes right now the other shows they're  still working on are the nymerian the ten thousand  
n-sjljn2dNw,607280,612000,ships said in the past there's one specifically  about corliss valerian the sea snake he's a  
n-sjljn2dNw,612000,615360,character that we're gonna see during the events  of house of the dragon but i believe it's meant to  
n-sjljn2dNw,615360,619680,be an older version of the character during house  of the dragon there's a dunk and egg series based on  
n-sjljn2dNw,619680,624160,the books about those characters remember it's sir  duncan the tall who's the ancestor of brienne the  
n-sjljn2dNw,624160,629920,tarth an egg is really aegon v the future king of  westeros it's also a prequel series but he's the  
n-sjljn2dNw,629920,634480,younger brother of maester aemon that's why when  he's dying he starts speaking about an event that  
n-sjljn2dNw,634480,639920,happened with his brother egg just for reference  2 jon snow's real name is aegon that would make  
n-sjljn2dNw,639920,644720,him aegon vi if he were to take the iron throne  there are also a couple different animated game  
n-sjljn2dNw,644720,647839,of thrones series that they're working on but  we don't know as much about what's going on with  
n-sjljn2dNw,647840,652000,the plot of those and the whole thing with kit  harrington coming back as the black knight inside  
n-sjljn2dNw,652000,656320,the marvel universe is that i believe that's  mostly meant to be cameo status right now i think  
n-sjljn2dNw,656320,660080,for a little while people were wondering if they  would do a black knight series on disney plus it  
n-sjljn2dNw,660080,664560,sounds like they're not doing that now and he'll  just be in future movie crossovers and that's why  
n-sjljn2dNw,664560,669600,he has so much extra time to do this full big  game of thrones sequel series but everyone post  
n-sjljn2dNw,669600,674240,all your theories in the comments below who do you  want to be the villain of this new jon snow sequel  
n-sjljn2dNw,674240,678480,series i will do more videos for when we get  more trailers and details they probably released
