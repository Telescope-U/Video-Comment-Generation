Y2aPjR-E49o,100,1990,"- Hey there guys, gals and non-binary pals,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,1990,4040,"this is chef and author Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,4040,6230,and I'm here to answer your cooking questions on Twitter.
Y2aPjR-E49o,6230,7760,This is Cooking Support.
Y2aPjR-E49o,7760,10427,[upbeat music]
Y2aPjR-E49o,12397,14730,"@dollarsmore asks, what's the difference of cooking"
Y2aPjR-E49o,14730,17410,Chinese food with a wok than your regular frying
Y2aPjR-E49o,17410,18360,or sauce pan?
Y2aPjR-E49o,18360,20070,"All right, so the main difference between a frying pan,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,20070,23600,"a Western-style frying pan like this, and a wok"
Y2aPjR-E49o,23600,25160,is obviously this shape.
Y2aPjR-E49o,25160,27740,"So the way a wok heats up, you're gonna get a really hot"
Y2aPjR-E49o,27740,29369,zone in the center down here where it's closest
Y2aPjR-E49o,29370,31530,"to the flame, and then it's going to get progressively"
Y2aPjR-E49o,31530,32362,cooler.
Y2aPjR-E49o,32362,33960,"A western-style frying pan on the other hand,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,33960,36500,"all of this is meant to be relatively evenly heated,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,36500,37720,so you don't get those cooking zones.
Y2aPjR-E49o,37720,40590,"In a Western skillet, you're going to be shaking around,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,40590,42780,"and when you around like this, when you're sauteing"
Y2aPjR-E49o,42780,45940,"something, the food naturally forms an even layer"
Y2aPjR-E49o,45940,47260,and it cooks evenly.
Y2aPjR-E49o,47260,49800,"And that's really good for sweating vegetables,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,49800,51120,the things that you might do at the beginning
Y2aPjR-E49o,51120,53449,"of a soup, or a sauce, or a stock, something like that."
Y2aPjR-E49o,53450,56190,"Whereas in a wok, when you shake it, they obviously all fall"
Y2aPjR-E49o,56190,57859,down to the bottom so you don't get an even layer.
Y2aPjR-E49o,57860,61671,"However, in a wok, the shape allows you to really efficient"
Y2aPjR-E49o,61671,64610,"get food moving through the air, and that's the process"
Y2aPjR-E49o,64610,66920,you're gonna be doing when you're stir frying the majority
Y2aPjR-E49o,66920,67753,of the time.
Y2aPjR-E49o,67753,70272,So that's difference between a wok and a Western skillet.
Y2aPjR-E49o,70273,74550,"@truevisuals asks, what's with asparagus and stinky pee?"
Y2aPjR-E49o,74550,77050,Asparagus contains these sulfur compounds that some people
Y2aPjR-E49o,77050,79240,can digest and some people cannot.
Y2aPjR-E49o,79240,81540,It's estimated that about 20 to 50% of people
Y2aPjR-E49o,81540,84200,"cannot adjust these sulfur compounds, and for those of us,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,84200,87200,"which includes me, if you eat asparagus, about 15 minutes"
Y2aPjR-E49o,87200,90159,"later, go pee and your pee is going to smell"
Y2aPjR-E49o,90160,91160,like these sulfur compounds.
Y2aPjR-E49o,91160,93030,So there's a very distinct asparagus pee smell.
Y2aPjR-E49o,93030,95409,Now this gets confounded by the fact that there are also
Y2aPjR-E49o,95410,98040,some people who can smell these compounds and some people
Y2aPjR-E49o,98040,99140,who can't.
Y2aPjR-E49o,99140,102080,TaineMcLean says how do you ruin a good burger?
Y2aPjR-E49o,102080,104000,"So personally, there's a few things I like to avoid"
Y2aPjR-E49o,104000,105070,when I'm making a burger.
Y2aPjR-E49o,105070,107040,I don't like adding things inside the burger.
Y2aPjR-E49o,107040,110220,"So I don't like adding egg crumbs, or eggs, or spices,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,110220,111053,or seasonings.
Y2aPjR-E49o,111053,113100,"I feel when you do that, it turns it more into a meatloaf,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,113100,114920,what I associate with a meatloaf texture and flavor.
Y2aPjR-E49o,114920,116380,So I like just pure ground beef.
Y2aPjR-E49o,116380,117930,I do like to have it plenty fatty.
Y2aPjR-E49o,117930,121100,"So you know, something around 25 to 30% fat in my burger,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,121100,121933,that's what I want.
Y2aPjR-E49o,121933,123960,"I want it nice and salty, whether it's gonna be thick"
Y2aPjR-E49o,123960,126940,"or thin, I want it to have a nice deeply brown crust."
Y2aPjR-E49o,126940,128570,"There are some people who like steamed burgers,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,128570,132227,"it's a thing, but please don't steam my burger. [laughs]"
Y2aPjR-E49o,132227,135400,"@HaitianSOUL asks, does anybody know how to butcher"
Y2aPjR-E49o,135400,136232,a whole chicken?
Y2aPjR-E49o,136233,137720,"Uh, me, I know how to butcher a chicken."
Y2aPjR-E49o,137720,138553,So I'll show you right here.
Y2aPjR-E49o,138553,140090,So why would you wanna butcher a whole chicken?
Y2aPjR-E49o,140090,140922,It'll save you money.
Y2aPjR-E49o,140923,142480,It's cheaper to buy a whole chicken than to buy
Y2aPjR-E49o,142480,143330,the individual parts.
Y2aPjR-E49o,143330,146060,It also gives you lots of tasty things like the backbones
Y2aPjR-E49o,146060,148150,"and the carcass, you'll use those to make stocks"
Y2aPjR-E49o,148150,149640,that are better than what you could buy in a box.
Y2aPjR-E49o,149640,150910,We are gonna first take off the legs.
Y2aPjR-E49o,150910,152610,There's this little flab of skin that stretches out.
Y2aPjR-E49o,152610,155030,"All you gotta do is kind of nick that with a sharp knife,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,155030,157850,"just like that, and do the same thing on the other side."
Y2aPjR-E49o,157850,158990,Just give it a little nick.
Y2aPjR-E49o,158990,163090,Get your thumbs in there and twist them until the joints
Y2aPjR-E49o,163090,163922,pop out.
Y2aPjR-E49o,163923,166070,Now you hold it by one leg with the chicken kind of hanging
Y2aPjR-E49o,166070,168110,"down, and then what you wanna do is you want to get"
Y2aPjR-E49o,168110,171930,"your knife in here, and right here is a little nugget"
Y2aPjR-E49o,171930,174640,"of meat called the oyster, you want that to come with you,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,174640,176830,you don't want it to stay in the carcass cause it's tasty.
Y2aPjR-E49o,176830,179220,So we're gonna try it as much as possible to get our knife
Y2aPjR-E49o,179220,180500,down into there.
Y2aPjR-E49o,180500,183120,"And then we just go through the joint,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,183120,185269,"which we just popped out, and then you have your leg."
Y2aPjR-E49o,185270,188170,"Same thing on the other side, make sure we get the oyster."
Y2aPjR-E49o,189760,193390,"Look for the articulation, the place where the two joints"
Y2aPjR-E49o,193390,194400,"meet, right there."
Y2aPjR-E49o,194400,196640,"Now you want to get your knife right in that slot,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,196640,197800,and just cut through.
Y2aPjR-E49o,197800,198820,All of this should be pretty easy.
Y2aPjR-E49o,198820,201284,"If you feel yourself forcing it, then you're hit the bone"
Y2aPjR-E49o,201284,202430,and you want to reset.
Y2aPjR-E49o,202430,204950,I like to leave my chicken breasts with the skin on
Y2aPjR-E49o,204950,206580,and bone in typically when I'm cooking them.
Y2aPjR-E49o,206580,208960,"So the way I do that is first I take this wing off,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,208960,213210,twist the chicken around until you've cut all the meat
Y2aPjR-E49o,213210,215440,"around that wing, and your knife is in contact with the bone"
Y2aPjR-E49o,215440,216761,the whole way.
Y2aPjR-E49o,216761,217594,So we see some bare bone here.
Y2aPjR-E49o,217594,219340,Flip it like that and it pops right off.
Y2aPjR-E49o,219340,221019,"And you have this nice exposed bone,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,221020,223380,which is gonna look really pretty when you cook it.
Y2aPjR-E49o,223380,225220,And then you can get the whole chicken wing
Y2aPjR-E49o,225220,228420,with the drumette and the flat attached.
Y2aPjR-E49o,228420,231200,"Okay, and now for your chicken breast, you cut down"
Y2aPjR-E49o,231200,233739,"into the ribs, and this is the only place"
Y2aPjR-E49o,233740,235140,where you're gonna be cutting through bones.
Y2aPjR-E49o,235140,237060,The ribs are pretty easy to cut through though.
Y2aPjR-E49o,237060,241090,"You go all the way down, flip this inside-out,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,241090,242800,the wishbone's gonna pop right out like that.
Y2aPjR-E49o,242800,244560,"There's your chicken back, you can chop that up"
Y2aPjR-E49o,244560,246180,to make stock with.
Y2aPjR-E49o,246180,248540,Split the chicken right down the sternum.
Y2aPjR-E49o,248540,253090,"And there you've got a bone in, skin on chicken breast"
Y2aPjR-E49o,253090,253922,for cooking.
Y2aPjR-E49o,253923,256090,And then if you do want to remove the chicken breast
Y2aPjR-E49o,256090,259079,"from the carcass, what you're gonna do is run the tip"
Y2aPjR-E49o,259079,262810,of your knife basically along one side of the sternum.
Y2aPjR-E49o,262810,264310,The meat should separate pretty easily.
Y2aPjR-E49o,264310,267400,Run your thumb along the meat and pull it away
Y2aPjR-E49o,267400,269440,from that connective tissue.
Y2aPjR-E49o,269440,270998,"Then just finish it off with your knife,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,270998,272500,and then you've got your boneless chicken breast.
Y2aPjR-E49o,272500,274678,And that is how you butcher a chicken.
Y2aPjR-E49o,274678,279378,"@joshnamaharaj asks, hey peeps, doing some research,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,279378,281720,how do you get really crispy skin on your roasted chicken?
Y2aPjR-E49o,281720,284010,"To get really crispy chicken skin, there's a few steps"
Y2aPjR-E49o,284010,284843,you have to take.
Y2aPjR-E49o,284843,286349,"What I like to do is spatchcock it, so I cut out"
Y2aPjR-E49o,286350,287690,the backbone with a pair of scissors.
Y2aPjR-E49o,287690,289400,"You can ask the butcher to do it for you also,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,289400,291509,then you can lay it out flat so you get all this surface
Y2aPjR-E49o,291510,293470,area exposure to the heat of the oven.
Y2aPjR-E49o,293470,295540,"Finally, the other thing I like to do is I season it"
Y2aPjR-E49o,295540,298420,with a mixture of kosher salt and baking powder.
Y2aPjR-E49o,298420,300840,"Mix it up in a bowl, sprinkle it all over your chicken."
Y2aPjR-E49o,300840,303410,What have happens is the baking powder will react with some
Y2aPjR-E49o,303410,306042,"of the juices that are coming out of the chicken skin,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,306042,307120,"and those juices are really rich in protein,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,307120,308940,"and they form these teeny tiny bubbles,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,308940,311130,that as they dehydrate they add surface area
Y2aPjR-E49o,311130,313744,and therefore extra crunch to your chicken skin.
Y2aPjR-E49o,313744,317680,"@FIOONANANA, I didn't know that radiation is also one"
Y2aPjR-E49o,317680,319550,of the heat transfer methods for food.
Y2aPjR-E49o,319550,322004,How the hell radiation cooks food?
Y2aPjR-E49o,322005,325390,[laughs] So there are three basic types of heat transfer.
Y2aPjR-E49o,325390,326770,Whether you're talking about food or anything.
Y2aPjR-E49o,326770,329979,"There is conduction, that's when I touch a hot metal pan"
Y2aPjR-E49o,329980,332070,and the heat is going directly from the metal surface.
Y2aPjR-E49o,332070,334600,"There is convection, which is when the heat is transferred"
Y2aPjR-E49o,334600,337930,"through a medium, such as flowing air or flowing water."
Y2aPjR-E49o,337930,340199,"And then there's radiation, when you don't need any kind"
Y2aPjR-E49o,340200,341070,of contact at all.
Y2aPjR-E49o,341070,343250,The most common form of radiation you're probably gonna find
Y2aPjR-E49o,343250,345490,in your cooking is when you're baking something in the oven.
Y2aPjR-E49o,345490,347904,An oven cooks through a combination of convection in the air
Y2aPjR-E49o,347904,350539,and infrared radiation directly from the oven walls.
Y2aPjR-E49o,350540,353660,"So whenever you're cooking over coals or under a broiler,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,353660,355800,the type of heating that you're doing is radiation.
Y2aPjR-E49o,355800,358319,It's direct heat energy coming from the heat source
Y2aPjR-E49o,358320,361402,"through the vacuum of space or through the air, as it were."
Y2aPjR-E49o,361402,365450,"@WorseMake asks, tell me, Hank, what constitutes a pinch"
Y2aPjR-E49o,365450,368470,"of oregano, a smidge of basil, and what is salting to taste?"
Y2aPjR-E49o,368470,369710,Whose taste? What kind of taste?
Y2aPjR-E49o,369710,372300,"So if somebody says a pinch of oregano or a pinch of cumin,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,372300,374180,"I would think that it's about this, about a 16th"
Y2aPjR-E49o,374180,375190,of a teaspoon or so.
Y2aPjR-E49o,375190,377970,"But if you love oregano, you love cumin, put more of it in,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,377970,378910,it doesn't really matter.
Y2aPjR-E49o,378910,381570,"The one case where it does matter is with salt,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,381570,385270,because salt can have a severe impact on the way foods cook
Y2aPjR-E49o,385270,387819,"because it chemically interacts with meats,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,387820,390040,it chemically interacts with a bunch of different things.
Y2aPjR-E49o,390040,392780,"But with salt, typically what you're looking for is around"
Y2aPjR-E49o,392780,397780,a 1 to 2% ratio of salt to other stuff in each given bite.
Y2aPjR-E49o,398060,400919,"So if I have a soup, I can weigh out the soup and I can add"
Y2aPjR-E49o,400920,403940,"1% of that weight in salt, and it will taste relatively"
Y2aPjR-E49o,403940,405677,well-seasoned to most people.
Y2aPjR-E49o,405677,408380,"@eari_m asks, does anyone want to know how the sausages"
Y2aPjR-E49o,408380,409213,are made?
Y2aPjR-E49o,409213,410600,"Well, that's an easy question, I wanna know how the sausage"
Y2aPjR-E49o,410600,412202,is made.
Y2aPjR-E49o,412202,413790,"I started a sausage restaurant in San Mateo,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,413790,416050,so I have a good deal of knowledge about how sausage
Y2aPjR-E49o,416050,417141,is made.
Y2aPjR-E49o,417141,418780,"So yes, sausages have this reputation of being sort of"
Y2aPjR-E49o,418780,420970,"lower quality meat, they're made out of scraps."
Y2aPjR-E49o,420970,422957,"I think that's good, it's a way to use up all the different"
Y2aPjR-E49o,422957,425970,",parts of the animals. They are just meat, fat, seasonings,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,425970,429180,"importantly, salt, and then they are stuffed into casings."
Y2aPjR-E49o,429180,432100,"So in a sausage, there are a few elements."
Y2aPjR-E49o,432100,434670,"So when you cut open a sausage, what you're going to see"
Y2aPjR-E49o,434670,436280,is a few things.
Y2aPjR-E49o,436280,437590,"First, there's going to be the meat."
Y2aPjR-E49o,437590,440290,"Sausages are often made from pork shoulder, the lean meat,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,440290,442330,that's gonna be the darker colored parts.
Y2aPjR-E49o,442330,444530,"You're going to see the fat, which are these creamier"
Y2aPjR-E49o,444530,445560,white parts.
Y2aPjR-E49o,445560,447600,"You might see little specs in there, and those are gonna be"
Y2aPjR-E49o,447600,449770,the spices that you're adding to flavor it.
Y2aPjR-E49o,449770,452139,"Finally, the most important element that you won't see"
Y2aPjR-E49o,452140,453570,with your eye is the salt.
Y2aPjR-E49o,453570,455250,You cannot make a sausage without salt.
Y2aPjR-E49o,455250,457780,"What happens is when you mix ground meat with salt,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,457780,460480,"and you start kneading it, the salt will dissolve some"
Y2aPjR-E49o,460480,463370,of the muscle proteins and it allows them to stick together
Y2aPjR-E49o,463370,465199,and it forms this protein matrix.
Y2aPjR-E49o,465200,468070,So salt and meat is what gives a sausage structure.
Y2aPjR-E49o,468070,471530,The casings are typically made out of pig intestines.
Y2aPjR-E49o,471530,474290,"If you get a big, great big salami, that's probably"
Y2aPjR-E49o,474290,475310,a cow intestine.
Y2aPjR-E49o,475310,478134,"And if you're getting a natural casing hotdog,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,478134,478967,that is a lamb intestine.
Y2aPjR-E49o,478967,481010,"Yes, nothing to be afraid of, great way to use up all"
Y2aPjR-E49o,481010,483177,"the different parts of the animal, and delicious."
Y2aPjR-E49o,483177,488177,"@bbychumpz says, why do eggs make normal food taste better?"
Y2aPjR-E49o,488220,489610,"Burgers, ramen, more eggs?"
Y2aPjR-E49o,489610,492599,Put an egg on dat hoe and call it a meal. [laughs]
Y2aPjR-E49o,492600,495920,"If you think about it, an egg is a thing that contains"
Y2aPjR-E49o,495920,498550,all the nutrients a growing embryo needs.
Y2aPjR-E49o,498550,502909,"So it's nutrient dense, and our bodies are hardwired"
Y2aPjR-E49o,502910,504860,to like foods that are nutrient dense.
Y2aPjR-E49o,504860,507080,"That's why eggs taste so delicious, it's as simple as that."
Y2aPjR-E49o,507080,509156,"So we taste it and we think, yum, this is good."
Y2aPjR-E49o,509157,511950,"@thescramble asks, question for you, how often do you"
Y2aPjR-E49o,511950,513870,sharpen your knives and how do you do it?
Y2aPjR-E49o,513870,517289,I sharpen my knives probably once every six months or so.
Y2aPjR-E49o,517289,518430,I like to use waterstones.
Y2aPjR-E49o,518430,520760,"This one is 1,000 and 6,000."
Y2aPjR-E49o,520760,523380,"The lower the number, the grittier it is."
Y2aPjR-E49o,523380,526020,"So I typically start with 800 to 1,000 or so,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,526020,527810,"and then go up to around 6,000."
Y2aPjR-E49o,527810,530410,"So from the cutting edge to the back, and divide that"
Y2aPjR-E49o,530410,531243,by three.
Y2aPjR-E49o,531243,533540,And what you wanna do is maintain that angle the entire time
Y2aPjR-E49o,533540,534373,you're sharpening.
Y2aPjR-E49o,534373,537690,I go in one direction for about 20 strokes or so.
Y2aPjR-E49o,537690,540878,"And by that point, the metal gets pushed up and it curls"
Y2aPjR-E49o,540878,542470,over the edge of the knife.
Y2aPjR-E49o,542470,543910,I should feel a burr on that side.
Y2aPjR-E49o,543910,546050,Then you can flip the knife over and start working
Y2aPjR-E49o,546050,546910,on the other side.
Y2aPjR-E49o,546910,549529,And so I'll start with 20 on each side until I feel a burr
Y2aPjR-E49o,549530,551550,"on both sides, then I'll go down to 10 on each side,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,551550,553790,"then I'll go down to something like four, then two,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,553790,555399,and then I'll do a single strokes.
Y2aPjR-E49o,555400,558060,"And once that's all done, I'll move over to a higher grit"
Y2aPjR-E49o,558060,558893,stone.
Y2aPjR-E49o,558893,561017,So that's the basic process of sharpening a knife.
Y2aPjR-E49o,561017,565910,"@DennisNderitu_ asks, what is myoglobin?"
Y2aPjR-E49o,565910,568139,What is the function of myoglobin?
Y2aPjR-E49o,568140,571190,Myoglobin is a pigment that makes our muscles red.
Y2aPjR-E49o,571190,573130,"So when you look at a steak and you say, oh,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,573130,575380,"it's still bloody, that's actually not blood that you're"
Y2aPjR-E49o,575380,576940,"seeing giving it the color, it's myoglobin,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,576940,577830,which is muscle pigment.
Y2aPjR-E49o,577830,580810,"Now with some modern meat manufacturers, what they sometimes"
Y2aPjR-E49o,580810,584020,"do is that if you buy vacuum sealed meat in those pouches,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,584020,585030,it'll look very bright red.
Y2aPjR-E49o,585030,587460,And what they've done is they've injected that pouch
Y2aPjR-E49o,587460,589070,with carbon monoxide.
Y2aPjR-E49o,589070,592190,"And when carbon monoxide reacts with myoglobin, it turns"
Y2aPjR-E49o,592190,593720,into carboxymyoglobin.
Y2aPjR-E49o,593720,596589,There's a myth going around that the food industry is dyeing
Y2aPjR-E49o,596590,598680,meat red to make it look more appealing to customers.
Y2aPjR-E49o,598680,600460,"They're not literally dyeing it red,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,600460,602110,they're just kind of maintaining that red color
Y2aPjR-E49o,602110,604670,"in what may be a sneaky underhanded manner,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,604670,606720,but it's not going to affect the quality of the meat.
Y2aPjR-E49o,606720,610649,"Alaingruetter says, anyone recommend me a good cooking wok?"
Y2aPjR-E49o,610650,612780,What I would recommend for a home cook is a flat bottom
Y2aPjR-E49o,612780,613949,wok.
Y2aPjR-E49o,613949,614782,"There's a bunch of materials you can choose from,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,614782,617230,"carbon steel is the best for a wok because it's inexpensive,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,617230,619990,"it's indestructible, you can raise it to a really high"
Y2aPjR-E49o,619990,620823,temperature.
Y2aPjR-E49o,620823,622610,So here's another wok we have here.
Y2aPjR-E49o,622610,626149,"So this is a non-stick wok, so non-stick will be"
Y2aPjR-E49o,626150,628110,"the material I would be least likely to recommend,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,628110,630560,because non-stick cannot be heated to the temperatures
Y2aPjR-E49o,630560,632500,required for certain types of stir frys.
Y2aPjR-E49o,632500,634870,"What happens is if you heat up non-stick, the coating"
Y2aPjR-E49o,634870,637500,will start the vaporize and it's really unhealthy
Y2aPjR-E49o,637500,638333,to breathe in.
Y2aPjR-E49o,638333,640677,"So non-stick woks, I would stay away from them."
Y2aPjR-E49o,640677,645440,"@kayeeelah says, why is angel hair pasta so damn sticky?"
Y2aPjR-E49o,645440,648960,"For something angelic, it sure is a pain in the ass."
Y2aPjR-E49o,648960,651040,Angel hair in particular is going to be very sticky
Y2aPjR-E49o,651040,654190,"because for a given volume of pasta, because it's so skinny,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,654190,657530,you're going to have a very high amount of surface area.
Y2aPjR-E49o,657530,659310,"So the more surface area you have, the more starch"
Y2aPjR-E49o,659310,661700,"is gonna come out, the more surfaces there are to stick"
Y2aPjR-E49o,661700,662533,to each other.
Y2aPjR-E49o,662533,665140,"In order to keep pasta from sticking, you do wanna get it"
Y2aPjR-E49o,665140,668090,into a sufficient volume of water that you can get it moving
Y2aPjR-E49o,668090,668980,right from the start.
Y2aPjR-E49o,668980,671790,So the main time when pasta's gonna stick together is right
Y2aPjR-E49o,671790,673259,at the beginning as it's starting to cook.
Y2aPjR-E49o,673260,675440,So you wanna make sure that your pasta's moving right
Y2aPjR-E49o,675440,676273,at the beginning.
Y2aPjR-E49o,676273,678650,"Once it starts moving, and boiling, and setting,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,678650,681167,"and softening, it's not really gonna stick as much."
Y2aPjR-E49o,681167,684580,"@ChowOyinboNyash asks, can someone please help me,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,684580,685930,how do you make fried rice?
Y2aPjR-E49o,685930,688010,"I could explain it, but I will just show you instead."
Y2aPjR-E49o,688010,689620,You don't need any specific type of rice.
Y2aPjR-E49o,689620,691710,The most important part is that it is dry.
Y2aPjR-E49o,691710,695290,"Take a little bit of corn starch, sprinkle it over,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,695290,697420,and that's gonna help you break up the individual grains
Y2aPjR-E49o,697420,698253,of rice.
Y2aPjR-E49o,698253,699086,I recommend a wok.
Y2aPjR-E49o,699086,700747,"So you wanna preheat it over really high heat,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,700747,703160,and you want everything to go really hot and fast.
Y2aPjR-E49o,703160,705259,"I've got a couple eggs, scramble them with just a little"
Y2aPjR-E49o,705260,706200,pinch of salt.
Y2aPjR-E49o,706200,707350,Get 'em right in there.
Y2aPjR-E49o,710840,712740,Gonna cook 'em just until they're set.
Y2aPjR-E49o,714670,716820,And then out they go into a bowl we have waiting
Y2aPjR-E49o,716820,717653,on the side.
Y2aPjR-E49o,717653,719800,"All right, so now I'm gonna reheat my wok and start working"
Y2aPjR-E49o,719800,721102,on my rice.
Y2aPjR-E49o,722695,726150,And the goal here is to really try and separate the grains
Y2aPjR-E49o,726150,728010,without turning them into one big pile of mush.
Y2aPjR-E49o,728010,730357,So you can see I'm using the back of the spatula here
Y2aPjR-E49o,730357,732310,to kind of push 'em against the wok and keep 'em moving
Y2aPjR-E49o,732310,735860,"all the time, over the highest heat possible."
Y2aPjR-E49o,735860,737570,"Instead of cooking all the rice at once,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,737570,739710,"if you have a really weak burner, cook it in two different"
Y2aPjR-E49o,739710,742250,"batches, and then we'll add everything back in at the end."
Y2aPjR-E49o,742250,744310,"Wok smoking hot, a little bit more oil in the center."
Y2aPjR-E49o,744310,745630,Onions are gonna go in.
Y2aPjR-E49o,745630,746960,Carrots are gonna go in.
Y2aPjR-E49o,746960,748933,Some of these frozen peas are gonna go in.
Y2aPjR-E49o,751110,754463,"I'm gonna add some garlic, a little pinch of scallions."
Y2aPjR-E49o,757350,759500,"Now finally, everything is gonna go back in."
Y2aPjR-E49o,759500,762610,"So the rice and the eggs, and now what we'll do"
Y2aPjR-E49o,762610,765060,is we'll use our spatula to break those eggs up
Y2aPjR-E49o,765930,768029,so that we get a nice even distribution.
Y2aPjR-E49o,768030,769330,Soy sauce around the edge.
Y2aPjR-E49o,770710,771820,Sesame oil.
Y2aPjR-E49o,771820,774040,It's important to add your sauces around edge when
Y2aPjR-E49o,774040,776110,"you're cooking in a wok like this, because what happens"
Y2aPjR-E49o,776110,778279,"is if you add 'em directly to the center,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,778280,779620,"they kind of trickle down through the food,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,779620,780870,so they don't really sear.
Y2aPjR-E49o,780870,782930,"Whereas if you add 'em around the edge, you can see they"
Y2aPjR-E49o,782930,784620,give that nice sizzle right when you add them.
Y2aPjR-E49o,784620,787050,And what that does is it reduces the soy sauce rapidly
Y2aPjR-E49o,787050,789380,"and kind of introduces new flavors, gives it a little bit"
Y2aPjR-E49o,789380,790230,of the smokey flavor.
Y2aPjR-E49o,790230,791263,That's basically it.
Y2aPjR-E49o,792389,795620,So try it.
Y2aPjR-E49o,795620,796453,Delicious.
Y2aPjR-E49o,796453,798600,"So the big takeaways are, make sure that your rice is dry"
Y2aPjR-E49o,798600,801360,"before you start cooking with it, cook hot, cook in batches,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,801360,803437,"and cook fast, and that's basically it."
Y2aPjR-E49o,803437,806980,"@_LunaticDestiny asks, why would you use baking soda"
Y2aPjR-E49o,806980,807839,while cooking?
Y2aPjR-E49o,807840,810500,Baking soda is a powdered alkaline.
Y2aPjR-E49o,810500,812700,"When you take baking soda like this, and you add vinegar"
Y2aPjR-E49o,812700,816600,"to it, it's going to form carbon dioxide and water."
Y2aPjR-E49o,816600,821149,"That's what gives your cakes, and your pancakes, and cookies"
Y2aPjR-E49o,821150,822060,"lift, right?"
Y2aPjR-E49o,822060,823130,It's a chemical leavener.
Y2aPjR-E49o,823130,825560,"So you can take baking soda, put it in water and boil"
Y2aPjR-E49o,825560,829500,"Western-style pasta, and it will give it a springiness"
Y2aPjR-E49o,829500,831780,and a flavor very similar to Eastern-style things
Y2aPjR-E49o,831780,833186,like ramen.
Y2aPjR-E49o,833186,834569,"You can take baking soda, boil your potatoes,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,834570,838550,and what is the higher pH makes it so that the pectin
Y2aPjR-E49o,838550,840803,"on the surface of the potato, that's sort of"
Y2aPjR-E49o,840803,843160,the carbohydrate glue that holds the potato cells together.
Y2aPjR-E49o,843160,845269,The pectin breaks down faster.
Y2aPjR-E49o,845269,846690,And so you end up with potatoes that are softer
Y2aPjR-E49o,846690,849150,on the exterior so that when you subsequently toss them
Y2aPjR-E49o,849150,850870,"and roast them, they get a lot more surface area,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,850870,851890,they make them extra crispy.
Y2aPjR-E49o,851890,854480,"And finally, you can add baking soda to your beans"
Y2aPjR-E49o,854480,856440,if you're planning on making a bean soup or you want them
Y2aPjR-E49o,856440,857946,to tenderize faster.
Y2aPjR-E49o,857946,859290,So I add baking soda to the water when I'm making something
Y2aPjR-E49o,859290,861250,"like hummus and I'm cooking the chickpeas,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,861250,864007,"cause it'll cook the chickpeas much, much faster."
Y2aPjR-E49o,864007,867410,"@RenHarker asks, what is so difficult about cooking pork"
Y2aPjR-E49o,867410,868690,to a safe temperature?
Y2aPjR-E49o,868690,870960,Maybe your parents' generation or your grandparents'
Y2aPjR-E49o,870960,873410,"generation, there was this time when pork was relatively"
Y2aPjR-E49o,873410,877209,unsafe to eat at raw or rare temperatures because
Y2aPjR-E49o,877210,880380,of the risk of a parasitic infection called trichinosis.
Y2aPjR-E49o,880380,883290,That has been almost completely eliminated in modern pork.
Y2aPjR-E49o,883290,885029,So it's not really something you have to worry about.
Y2aPjR-E49o,885030,887730,"So a lot of modern pork has very, very lean meat,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,887730,890110,and therefore it becomes harder to cook and keep juicy
Y2aPjR-E49o,890110,892537,because lean meat dries out a lot faster without the fat
Y2aPjR-E49o,892537,894339,and the connective tissue to keep it moist.
Y2aPjR-E49o,894340,896390,"So with pork, what I generally recommend the best way"
Y2aPjR-E49o,896390,898920,to cook it to a safe temperature and make it stay juicy
Y2aPjR-E49o,898920,899753,is to brine it.
Y2aPjR-E49o,899753,902430,"So if you have a pork chop, you put in a solution"
Y2aPjR-E49o,902430,905070,"of about 2% salt, 2 to 3% salt in water."
Y2aPjR-E49o,905070,907466,Or you can just sprinkle it with salt and let it sit
Y2aPjR-E49o,907466,908485,in your fridge overnight.
Y2aPjR-E49o,908485,909519,"And then when you cook it the next day, what happens is"
Y2aPjR-E49o,909520,911670,that salt breaks down on the muscle proteins so that
Y2aPjR-E49o,911670,914370,"as they cook, they don't actually constrict as much,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,914370,915970,they don't squeeze out as much moisture.
Y2aPjR-E49o,915970,918529,As far as safe cooking temperatures for pork versus beef
Y2aPjR-E49o,918530,920900,"versus chicken, the government will recommend that you take"
Y2aPjR-E49o,920900,923880,"them all to 165 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the temperature"
Y2aPjR-E49o,923880,927900,"at which you get a seven log reduction in bacteria,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,927900,930780,that is only one out of every 10 million bacteria
Y2aPjR-E49o,930780,931613,will survive.
Y2aPjR-E49o,931613,933829,"With most meats, I actually recommend cooking to a lower"
Y2aPjR-E49o,933830,934663,temperature.
Y2aPjR-E49o,934663,937310,"Things like steak are tastier at around 130 degrees,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,937310,939029,"I think, just when the fat starts to render out."
Y2aPjR-E49o,939030,941150,"And things like pork and chicken, I generally cook to about"
Y2aPjR-E49o,941150,943030,145 or 150 degrees.
Y2aPjR-E49o,943030,945830,"But essentially at 165 degrees, it takes less than a second"
Y2aPjR-E49o,945830,946750,for that to occur.
Y2aPjR-E49o,946750,949280,"Whereas at about 150 degrees, it takes a matter of minutes."
Y2aPjR-E49o,949280,951590,"So as long as you're taking your temperature carefully,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,951590,953010,and you're coming up to a specific temperature
Y2aPjR-E49o,953010,955230,"and letting it rest at that temperature before serving it,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,955230,957260,you can get the same safety level even
Y2aPjR-E49o,957260,958917,at lower temperatures.
Y2aPjR-E49o,958917,961690,"@riannotti asks, why is it so difficult to make"
Y2aPjR-E49o,961690,962523,perfect rice?
Y2aPjR-E49o,962523,964879,"It's either too soggy, sticky, or too hard, help me."
Y2aPjR-E49o,964879,966490,"Depending on the type of rice you're using,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,966490,968330,you're gonna need a different water to rice ratio.
Y2aPjR-E49o,968330,970390,"With something like a Japanese sushi style rice,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,970390,973460,"which is what I cook most, it's about 1.1 times water"
Y2aPjR-E49o,973460,974880,to one part of rice.
Y2aPjR-E49o,974880,976770,"I'll measure out my rice, put it in the pot."
Y2aPjR-E49o,976770,979430,"Then I'll measure out 1.1 times that volume of rice,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,979430,981870,"put it into the pot, start it cold, put a flame"
Y2aPjR-E49o,981870,984630,"underneath it, bring it up to a simmer, put the lid on it,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,984630,987200,turn the heat down to the lowest possible setting
Y2aPjR-E49o,987200,990200,and let it simmer at that temperature for about 10 minutes.
Y2aPjR-E49o,990200,992890,"Don't open it up, don't look at it, definitely, definitely"
Y2aPjR-E49o,992890,993910,do not stir it.
Y2aPjR-E49o,993910,996079,"If you start stirring it, what happens is you release"
Y2aPjR-E49o,996080,998260,all this excess starch and that's why your rice starts
Y2aPjR-E49o,998260,999460,to break and turn mushy.
Y2aPjR-E49o,999460,1001488,"After 10 minutes, shut the flame off and let it sit"
Y2aPjR-E49o,1001488,1004128,for another 10 to 15 minutes to completely absorb
Y2aPjR-E49o,1004128,1005260,all that liquid.
Y2aPjR-E49o,1005260,1007460,"And then finally, if you were patient and you didn't touch"
Y2aPjR-E49o,1007460,1010330,"anything, when you open it up, you should have perfect rice."
Y2aPjR-E49o,1010330,1012330,So those are all the questions for today.
Y2aPjR-E49o,1012330,1013163,Thank you so much.
Y2aPjR-E49o,1013163,1014860,"I love it when people ask questions like this,"
Y2aPjR-E49o,1014860,1016899,because it means you're thinking and you're using your brain
Y2aPjR-E49o,1016900,1018320,"while you're cooking, and you're not just following"
Y2aPjR-E49o,1018320,1020520,"the recipe, you're trying to get out there and experiment"
Y2aPjR-E49o,1020520,1021353,and I love that.
Y2aPjR-E49o,1021353,1023028,Thanks for watching Cooking Support.
