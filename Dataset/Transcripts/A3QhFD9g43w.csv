A3QhFD9g43w,0,6880,now this may come as a surprise to some of you  but i'm not particularly fashionable for the  
A3QhFD9g43w,6880,12880,last few years i've been incredibly into fashion  videos i watch fashion shows and fashion critics  
A3QhFD9g43w,12880,21040,i really enjoy fashion in theory in practice  something gets a little lost in translation  
A3QhFD9g43w,21040,28000,because i am incapable of dressing myself not  physically because i i know how to put on clothes  
A3QhFD9g43w,28000,32160,i just don't know how to put on clothes that  look good and then it hit me i've got a youtube  
A3QhFD9g43w,32160,36160,channel we could make this a thing over the  last few weeks i've been trying a new series  
A3QhFD9g43w,36160,41920,on tick tock where i try and become a fashion  girl and it's been a journey um i sometimes hit  
A3QhFD9g43w,43840,48320,more often miss so i thought it would be nice  to take this idea and take it one step further  
A3QhFD9g43w,48320,53440,if the main thing that i'm struggling with is  putting the outfits together why don't i just  
A3QhFD9g43w,54080,60160,hire someone to do that bit for me and it got me  thinking if i gave a professional personal stylist  
A3QhFD9g43w,60160,66560,and a slightly less experienced personal stylist  the exact same brief for outfits that i wanted  
A3QhFD9g43w,68480,72080,would there really be such a big difference  between the two right now i know what you're  
A3QhFD9g43w,72080,78560,thinking she's she's changed clothes she's got a  slightly sheepish look on her face she's probably  
A3QhFD9g43w,78560,83360,about to do a sponsorship um and you're absolutely  right but i really don't want you to skip this  
A3QhFD9g43w,83360,87440,"one and there are a couple of reasons why and the  first reason is because the first 1,000 people to  "

A3QhFD9g43w,92880,97039,what you've been dreaming of and the second reason  is because skillshare is the longest consistent  
A3QhFD9g43w,97040,103040,sponsor that i've had on my channel it completely  transformed how i approach learning skillshare is  
A3QhFD9g43w,103040,107360,an online learning community with thousands  of classes on pretty much whatever your heart

A3QhFD9g43w,113280,118640,you're interested in fashion design personal  styling if you're into digital illustration  
A3QhFD9g43w,119360,123040,there's a class for that too i sometimes find  that learning a new creative skill can be  
A3QhFD9g43w,123760,129840,frustrating and i get very easily discouraged  when i find things quite hard and that's one of  
A3QhFD9g43w,129840,134319,the reasons why i love skillshare so much every  single class i've taken felt like a unique and  
A3QhFD9g43w,134320,139600,fun experience for example the class i mentioned  earlier by laci jordan the digital illustration  
A3QhFD9g43w,139600,144560,for all discover cultivate and share your  unique personal style really allowed me to start  
A3QhFD9g43w,144560,150239,exploring illustration in an environment that  didn't feel stressful the class was incredibly  
A3QhFD9g43w,150240,155120,easy to understand and i felt very reassured  throughout the entirety of the process today this  
A3QhFD9g43w,155120,159840,is one of my favorite classes that i've ever taken  on skillshare skillshare can help you make 2022 a

A3QhFD9g43w,179280,183840,thank you to you for not skipping it and if you  did skip it and you just derived it that bit  
A3QhFD9g43w,184400,189920,that thank you isn't for you go back and watch  all the nice things that i said about skillshare  
A3QhFD9g43w,190960,195840,then you'll have earned the thank you  but not until you've done that all right  
A3QhFD9g43w,197760,202640,thank you for supporting my sponsors which  directly helps to support me right moving on  
A3QhFD9g43w,202640,208400,in order to make this a somewhat fair experiment  i was going to copy and paste the exact same brief  
A3QhFD9g43w,208400,214159,in the content box for both stylists this brief  covered things like the type of styles that i  
A3QhFD9g43w,214160,219760,enjoy what i like wearing what kind of events or  situations i wanted the outfits for the brief was  
A3QhFD9g43w,219760,224080,quite long but the main gist of it was that  i wanted traditional classic sophistication  
A3QhFD9g43w,224080,228880,i wanted looks that matched a color theme of  neutrals or monochrome nothing particularly  
A3QhFD9g43w,228880,233440,loud in color but a pop of color every now  and then was okay if it was tastefully done  
A3QhFD9g43w,233440,238080,now whilst both stylus got the same brief the  more expensive stylus did have a bit of an edge  
A3QhFD9g43w,238080,242720,and this is because they also wanted me to fill  in a google form with all the different varying  
A3QhFD9g43w,242720,247920,items of shoes or clothing that i did or  didn't like the more expensive stylist  
A3QhFD9g43w,247920,253440,also had a one-on-one call with me and this call  was to last half an hour and it was essentially  
A3QhFD9g43w,253440,259280,to run over in more detail my personal style my  likes my dislikes so that the stylist could get  
A3QhFD9g43w,259280,265440,more of an insight into who i was as a person and  that would hopefully allow them to get a better  
A3QhFD9g43w,265440,270560,insight into the kind of fashion and clothes that  i'd like to wear so i'm about to have a call with  
A3QhFD9g43w,270560,275760,the more expensive personal stylist i don't  actually know how she's gonna call me because  
A3QhFD9g43w,277200,282400,i haven't given her my number or anything so  maybe she's gonna set up a zoom this is such  
A3QhFD9g43w,282400,291120,a great outfit to talk to the new personal stylist  in we've got steve jobs on the top and uh frat boy  
A3QhFD9g43w,291760,296880,on the bottom do i even have zoom on this computer  i don't even know why i questioned that i mean  
A3QhFD9g43w,298400,303040,two years into a pandemic i don't know anyone that  doesn't have zoom on their computer at this point
A3QhFD9g43w,305680,313120,she was super cool i am interested now to see  how the twenty dollar one compares now both  
A3QhFD9g43w,313120,318080,stylists were going to make me a lookbook of ten  looks within these ten looks there was to be one  
A3QhFD9g43w,318080,322639,specific date night look all the other looks were  supposed to be everyday looks that you could wear  
A3QhFD9g43w,322640,326320,going out for the day they were supposed to be  looks that were accessible no matter what the  
A3QhFD9g43w,326320,332960,situation so nothing too garish or loud as well as  giving them my brief i gave each stylist a budget  
A3QhFD9g43w,332960,340000,"of 5,000 pounds now to be clear i was  not going to spend 5,000 pounds buying  "
A3QhFD9g43w,340000,345840,everything in each lookbook i had made the  decision beforehand to only buy three or  
A3QhFD9g43w,345840,350560,"four looks from each the main reason i set the  budget as 5,000 for each stylist was because  "
A3QhFD9g43w,350560,356400,i really wanted each stylist to be able to show  what they would truly want me to wear rather than  
A3QhFD9g43w,356400,361040,having to kneel to a budget constraint i've just  received an email from fiverr saying that my  
A3QhFD9g43w,361040,365920,order has been delivered which means i now have  both the expensive personal stylist and cheap  
A3QhFD9g43w,365920,372080,personal stylist look books so what i'm gonna do  is essentially blind react to them okay i'm gonna  
A3QhFD9g43w,372080,377039,do the cheaper lookbook first and then i'm gonna  do the more expensive one i'm weirdly nervous  
A3QhFD9g43w,377040,393840,and i've just seen the icon preview and there's  some hot pink in there some very bright pink okay
A3QhFD9g43w,395120,395620,okay
A3QhFD9g43w,400400,407840,surely not okay okay that's pretty good  
A3QhFD9g43w,417760,425120,for the most part i'm very confused both  stylists i gave a very clear brief that i wanted  
A3QhFD9g43w,425840,433199,classic sophisticated styles you know tailoring  neutral monochrome color palettes maybe there  
A3QhFD9g43w,433200,438960,could be a pop of color in there if it was  done tastefully but generally i wanted well put  
A3QhFD9g43w,438960,448639,together sophisticated classic styles now somehow  the cheaper influencer has taken that to mean  
A3QhFD9g43w,448640,456240,i want an influencer aesthetic now no disrespect  to the ig baddies but i wouldn't exactly classify  
A3QhFD9g43w,456240,466639,that as classic sophisticated style um  i'm just a bit confused as to how my brief  
A3QhFD9g43w,467760,478160,has given way to not one but two rhinestone  encrusted animal print bags one of which has  
A3QhFD9g43w,478160,484800,fringe outfit four is pretty close to the brief  towards the end of the lookbook it does get a bit  
A3QhFD9g43w,484800,491919,more unhinged right let's see if the expensive  personal stylist can do better i've just seen  
A3QhFD9g43w,491920,498800,the preview of it and it's giving me i go to  an all girls school in the 1950s vibes okay
A3QhFD9g43w,503840,509760,okay okay i love that that one's banging meh
A3QhFD9g43w,516479,527199,there's just so much going on here so this may  be another situation where maybe i'm just not  
A3QhFD9g43w,527200,534480,fashionable enough to see why this outfit  looks good there are one or two three maybe  
A3QhFD9g43w,534480,538880,outfits in here that i would say are perfect  they perfectly match my personal style love  
A3QhFD9g43w,538880,544560,them um there are a couple in here that i think  very basic and i think this also goes for the  
A3QhFD9g43w,545360,551279,cheaper one like i'm not particularly fashionable  person but i could put together a little black  
A3QhFD9g43w,551280,556720,dress with some pumps once i received both look  books the cheaper stylist did tell me that if  
A3QhFD9g43w,556720,560560,there was anything that i really wasn't a fan of  they would be more than happy to make a revision  
A3QhFD9g43w,560560,565520,to and change it and i did ask them to revise  some of the outfits and the main reason i did  
A3QhFD9g43w,565520,569520,that is just because the more expensive stylists  did have a lot more information on me than the  
A3QhFD9g43w,569520,574560,cheaper stylist and i felt like it was almost  leveling the playing field by just telling them  
A3QhFD9g43w,575600,581279,i don't really like pink um in all honesty i guess  you could say i'm a little bit underwhelmed some  
A3QhFD9g43w,581280,586480,of the outfits are just a mess i'll be honest  there are a couple in each lookbook that i just  
A3QhFD9g43w,586480,591600,don't see working at all for me there are  a couple of outfits in there that i think  
A3QhFD9g43w,591600,598639,are really cool but for the most part i i am very  concerned now there are a couple of things that  
A3QhFD9g43w,598640,602960,you may have noticed when looking through each  of the lookbooks the more expensive stylists  
A3QhFD9g43w,602960,608640,specifically reused a lot of the same items from  outfit to outfit and a big reason for that is  
A3QhFD9g43w,608640,614960,because during our phone call i stated that i was  a bigger fan of items that go with lots of outfits  
A3QhFD9g43w,614960,620880,than items that only go with one this is some  insight that the cheaper stylist did not have  
A3QhFD9g43w,620880,625680,the more expensive stylists also sourced from  lots of different brands this is not necessarily  
A3QhFD9g43w,625680,630960,the case with the cheaper outfits the majority of  the items from the cheaper stylist did come from  
A3QhFD9g43w,630960,637360,zara so they kind of didn't really do a lot of  shopping around it was mainly just from one or  
A3QhFD9g43w,637360,643279,two sites and now we have to do the painful part  we have to buy the clothes now this is where it  
A3QhFD9g43w,643280,647440,gets a little bit interesting now you know when  you buy clothes online when you add something  
A3QhFD9g43w,647440,654240,to your basket the website often gives you style  recommendations or outfit suggestions to go with  
A3QhFD9g43w,654240,659920,the item that you have just put in your basket  something very bizarre that i noticed for almost  
A3QhFD9g43w,659920,666480,every single item in the lookbook that the cheaper  stylist gave me all or nearly all of the other  
A3QhFD9g43w,666480,673120,items in the outfit were within the recommended to  go with this item section on the website now i'm  
A3QhFD9g43w,673120,679040,not saying that this is what happened or what this  individual did uh it could be a pure coincidence  
A3QhFD9g43w,679040,683759,but i did find it a little bit sus so i've decided  that i'm not gonna order every single outfit i'm  
A3QhFD9g43w,683760,690000,just gonna order the best one the worst one and  one in the middle and then a wild card from each  
A3QhFD9g43w,690000,695840,so around four outfits from each lookbook do  you know how much this has cost me now i really  
A3QhFD9g43w,695840,702880,thought by giving them a budget of 5000 each it  would mean that four outfits from each lookbook  
A3QhFD9g43w,702880,708480,would hopefully come in at just over a thousand  as you can see i'm not very good at maths um  
A3QhFD9g43w,708480,716160,which is scary given that i'm doing a degree in  economics four looks from a lookbook of 10 looks  
A3QhFD9g43w,716160,725120,that is worth 5 000 pounds is not going to cost  1 000 pounds this video ended up being the most  
A3QhFD9g43w,725120,730960,expensive video i've ever made on my channel um  do you want to know how much it ended up costing
A3QhFD9g43w,733360,734880,over 5 000 pounds
A3QhFD9g43w,738400,742000,once i had ordered everything it was just  a waiting game for everything to arrive  
A3QhFD9g43w,742560,745760,and once it started arriving it just didn't stop  
A3QhFD9g43w,747120,752160,oh i don't even know what to say this is  outrageous i don't think i've ever ordered  
A3QhFD9g43w,752160,757040,this much in my life ever this is like the perfect  picture of capitalism the only thing keeping me  
A3QhFD9g43w,757040,761040,from freaking out right now is the fact that i  know that 90 of this is probably gonna go back  
A3QhFD9g43w,761040,766720,um and therefore you know i'll be able to pay my  rent this month it feels like christmas except  
A3QhFD9g43w,766720,771839,i'm the one that had to pay for everything which i  have to say is my least favorite type of christmas  
A3QhFD9g43w,772480,778000,i think the way i'm gonna have to tackle this is  by opening all the boxes and separating them up by  
A3QhFD9g43w,778000,785280,outfit so that i know exactly which items go with  what because there is a preposterous amount of  
A3QhFD9g43w,785280,791520,things here let's open all this and uh regret our  financial decisions once all the items had arrived  
A3QhFD9g43w,791520,795600,it was time to try them on now i wasn't really  sure what the best way to do this was but what  
A3QhFD9g43w,795600,801040,i decided to do in the end was give you guys  the the ability to vote now each outfit has a  
A3QhFD9g43w,801040,804959,number and i would like you in the comments down  below to give each outfit a score out of 10. i'm  
A3QhFD9g43w,804960,810320,hoping that enough people do this that we can get  a definitive list from best to worst out of all of  
A3QhFD9g43w,810320,815840,the outfits regardless of whether the cheaper or  more expensive stylist designed them as a little  
A3QhFD9g43w,815840,820080,bonus if you would also like to say whether or  not you preferred the cheaper stylist looks to  
A3QhFD9g43w,820080,824240,the more expensive stylist looks that would also  be fun it's like a little fashion show i'll try on  
A3QhFD9g43w,824240,830000,the outfits and you give them a score out of 10.  okay it's time i've organized all of the outfits i  
A3QhFD9g43w,830000,834000,feel like i am quite far away from the camera but  this is the only way you're gonna be able to see  
A3QhFD9g43w,834000,840000,the full outfit so i apologize but i don't know  how else i'm supposed to do this i'm not gonna be  
A3QhFD9g43w,840000,845520,wearing any jewelry for any of these other than  this gold earring and i've straightened my hair  
A3QhFD9g43w,845520,849840,just so that you know you're aware that i'm  putting in some effort for this i don't know  
A3QhFD9g43w,849840,853280,whether i should do one of those edgy tic toc  transitions for each of the outfits like you  
A3QhFD9g43w,853280,858560,know when you you jump and then there's an outfit  change um or whether i should just walk in like a  
A3QhFD9g43w,859280,862720,regular person i don't know we'll figure  it out in post let's get into this  
A3QhFD9g43w,864160,871839,okay so the outfit's almost finished but inside  this garment bag is the most expensive item of  
A3QhFD9g43w,871840,878240,clothing i have ever purchased and just for a  bit of context at full price this item costs five  
A3QhFD9g43w,878240,886000,times my rent um i didn't pay that for it i paid  a small two times my rent which obviously so much  
A3QhFD9g43w,886000,892400,better so so much better and the funniest thing  is when it arrived it actually arrived broken um  
A3QhFD9g43w,893520,897680,i don't know about you but if i'm  paying for an item of clothing  
A3QhFD9g43w,897680,903120,that costs twice my rent i'd like it to  at least not be broken when it arrives  
A3QhFD9g43w,904960,909600,that might just be me to be fair this is the most  beautiful thing i've ever seen and i wish more  
A3QhFD9g43w,909600,914800,than anything that i could keep it but this video  is gonna have to do exceptionally well for that to  
A3QhFD9g43w,914800,922240,happen um so if you would like to help a girl out  please like the video consider leaving a comment  
A3QhFD9g43w,922240,928720,it is a leather coat by valentino it may not look  it right now but when you put this bad boy on  
A3QhFD9g43w,929760,934800,it is stunning for obvious reasons the tags are  going to stay on all of the items that i wear  
A3QhFD9g43w,934800,937760,today but you're going to have to imagine  them without just going to tuck this one  
A3QhFD9g43w,937760,943040,in here and we'll just pretend we'll just make  believe that i own this coat so it is broken  
A3QhFD9g43w,943040,949920,as you can see here this lapel button it just kind  of falls off whereas the other one is very much  
A3QhFD9g43w,949920,954320,secure um so you're gonna have to ignore  that as well also this is one of the only  
A3QhFD9g43w,954320,958320,outfits that has a bag that i didn't get and  the reason for that is because we ran out of  
A3QhFD9g43w,958320,961920,budget and most of the budget went on this  coat i'm gonna be honest so this is the fit  
A3QhFD9g43w,961920,968720,if you saw me in the street would you think i was  a fashion girl or potentially pregnant this is  
A3QhFD9g43w,968720,975759,where we're at with this outfit it's actually not  as bad as i thought it was gonna be um is it good
A3QhFD9g43w,978800,983680,that is another question although i do think that  the sunglasses and the coat are kind of a fit  
A3QhFD9g43w,983680,989040,just on their own i do feel like i'm about to ask  neo red pill or blue pill red pill blue pill neo  
A3QhFD9g43w,989840,994400,you decide i do feel like this would be  the kind of outfit we'd see a model wearing  
A3QhFD9g43w,994400,997120,do i think it's screaming model when i wear it
A3QhFD9g43w,999360,1005120,not so much to me it screams i kill pheasants  and live in a house in the country i think it's  
A3QhFD9g43w,1005120,1009839,the shorts i just don't know who's wearing  this you know i don't think i would ever  
A3QhFD9g43w,1010560,1014240,think to wear this ever which is i guess  is the point of a stylist because they're  
A3QhFD9g43w,1014240,1017200,supposed to be more knowledgeable than  you i don't know about this one guys  
A3QhFD9g43w,1017200,1022720,i don't what are you guys giving it out of 10  let me know in the comments okay moving on this  
A3QhFD9g43w,1022720,1027679,is the next outfit i really like the shape of  the top to be fair it's a little sweetheart  
A3QhFD9g43w,1027680,1032000,take the coat down a little minute there is  a little bra strap on on display but you know  
A3QhFD9g43w,1032000,1035920,what i've got about 100 outfits to try on so  i'm not changing bras every time you're asking  
A3QhFD9g43w,1035920,1040400,too much of me i don't know if this outfit in  particular looks like it's professionally styled  
A3QhFD9g43w,1040400,1044319,i kind of got this one because it's a more casual  outfit and i feel like it's quite accessible  
A3QhFD9g43w,1044319,1049279,in terms of the color matching i do think the  coat in the bag really adds something to this  
A3QhFD9g43w,1049280,1052800,because i think without them they would be  it would be an exceptionally plain outfit  
A3QhFD9g43w,1054400,1059440,okay well this is something so far these boots  are the most beautiful boots i've ever seen in  
A3QhFD9g43w,1059440,1065200,my entire life i really don't know about this  one guys this is kind of a bit of a mess to me  
A3QhFD9g43w,1065200,1070559,this is kind of reminds me of when you're a kid  and you just play dress up and you just chuck on  
A3QhFD9g43w,1070560,1074560,loads of different items and have no regard for  they go together because it's just make belief  
A3QhFD9g43w,1075280,1081920,this is not working at all to me i can kind of  get the the corset and this top but i just don't  
A3QhFD9g43w,1081920,1086640,get the brown trousers and maybe that's because  i'm not fashionable enough maybe that's just me  
A3QhFD9g43w,1086640,1091840,i just feel like there's way too much going on  maybe this is fashion though maybe my outfits are  
A3QhFD9g43w,1091840,1098799,just too simple and moving on here is the outfit  there is a little bit of cat hair on the suit but  
A3QhFD9g43w,1098800,1104720,we're going to ignore it i love this i think this  is so cool i feel very sophisticated i think this  
A3QhFD9g43w,1104720,1110799,is my favorite outfit from the $200 stylist this  is just a very me outfit it's masculine but it has  
A3QhFD9g43w,1110800,1118160,like a bit of a feminine edge i feel so cool this  is everything i've ever wanted from a suit vest  
A3QhFD9g43w,1118160,1122160,combo i feel like it fits me really well  i got the trousers in a size bigger than  
A3QhFD9g43w,1122160,1127360,my usual size just because i really prefer  it when my trousers are really loose around  
A3QhFD9g43w,1127360,1132000,my thighs i just think it's more comfortable i  think the stylus smashed it on this one moving on  
A3QhFD9g43w,1133440,1138000,i don't want to hear a word from any of you about  how i look like your grandma's curtains alright  
A3QhFD9g43w,1138000,1143040,not a single word i really do feel like this  dress has potential um if it was a different  
A3QhFD9g43w,1143040,1148400,color if you had this dress in this style and  then you maybe just didn't do it in a yellow  
A3QhFD9g43w,1149200,1154399,i feel like it could be something good at  the moment though i'm not 100 sure about this  
A3QhFD9g43w,1154400,1158400,one can we get some opinions from the audience  please so this is the last outfit from the 200  
A3QhFD9g43w,1158400,1163840,stylist i'm now going to move on to the ones  from the 20 stylist and we're gonna compare  
A3QhFD9g43w,1164640,1172480,this is outfit one from the 20 stylist i feel like  the more expensive stylist has done outfits that  
A3QhFD9g43w,1172480,1178640,would probably look really good for a photo shoot  whereas i feel like the cheaper stylist has done  
A3QhFD9g43w,1178640,1184400,outfits that you could actually wear this  is very commercially viable you know you  
A3QhFD9g43w,1184400,1189440,could wear this out so i think this is going  to be more highly rated by a lot of you just  
A3QhFD9g43w,1189440,1195600,because the fact that it's wearable you could  see yourself wearing this as an average person i
A3QhFD9g43w,1199040,1204960,i don't know guys i don't know i just feel like  if it weren't for the jacket this would actually  
A3QhFD9g43w,1204960,1209440,be quite a cute outfit this is kind of cute  i'm not gonna lie i kind of really love this  
A3QhFD9g43w,1209440,1214559,the dress feels gorgeous too it's a very like  thick material so i feel like i could wear it  
A3QhFD9g43w,1214560,1219520,out in the winter i love a little slit i love  a symmetric slit as well i've never worn long  
A3QhFD9g43w,1219520,1224400,boots with a dress before but i do feel like it  kind of works i think the jacket actually kills  
A3QhFD9g43w,1224400,1229520,this outfit in my opinion i think it looks much  better without it if we put on something like hold  
A3QhFD9g43w,1229520,1233920,on if we want to stick it with the leather but  put it with the dress i feel like the long coat  
A3QhFD9g43w,1233920,1238720,goes so much better right am i being delusional  i might be this coat is a bit of a power trip  
A3QhFD9g43w,1238720,1242720,look what you haven't even seen it done up  let me do it up it's going to blow your mind
A3QhFD9g43w,1245040,1252160,it's not canon but picture me in the matrix okay  would i make that film better objectively yes what  
A3QhFD9g43w,1252160,1257360,are we giving it out of 10 with and without the  coat please because you know this coat wasn't  
A3QhFD9g43w,1257360,1262640,it wasn't authentic to the outfit but come  on it should have been it should have been  
A3QhFD9g43w,1264160,1268080,i just want it on the record that i personally  do not understand why we would get a boot  
A3QhFD9g43w,1269040,1275840,you know warm insulator of the feet and then  cut a hole for your toes at the end of it  
A3QhFD9g43w,1276640,1284480,uh i'm not very happy guys i'm gonna be honest  with you i am feeling some distress i feel like  
A3QhFD9g43w,1284480,1291520,this is it could do you know like whatever it is  you wanted it to do it could do it theoretically  
A3QhFD9g43w,1292160,1300000,then we add the boots wait for the best part then  we add this bag this bedazzled sparkly zebra pimp  
A3QhFD9g43w,1300000,1307200,bag and as you can see i am visibly confused  my shoes are also squeaking which is great  
A3QhFD9g43w,1308720,1316159,i'm trying i just have so many questions  the main one being why and for what  
A3QhFD9g43w,1316160,1322880,scores out of 10 everyone and don't forget to  consider the squeaking toeless boots in that score  
A3QhFD9g43w,1324240,1330559,very important this is the outfit i don't  think it's as awful as i thought it would be  
A3QhFD9g43w,1330560,1335280,but i just don't understand how any of the  pieces go together unfortunately the shoes  
A3QhFD9g43w,1335280,1338800,weren't available in my size but i ordered  them just to show you them the shoes  
A3QhFD9g43w,1338800,1344000,would not have gone with this outfit and the bag  just is a monstrosity with this outfit i think  
A3QhFD9g43w,1344000,1348160,if you didn't have this bag and you didn't  try and wear those leopard print shoes  
A3QhFD9g43w,1348160,1352560,the outfit on its own would actually be okay i  don't think this is a bad outfit i do think the  
A3QhFD9g43w,1352560,1357440,coloring on the skirt is a bit meh but the style's  pretty and i think it goes with the top well in  
A3QhFD9g43w,1357440,1364720,terms of the style matching the top is very pretty  but it also costs 250 pounds so is it worth it who  
A3QhFD9g43w,1364720,1370320,knows let me know what you think at 10. now having  tried on all of the outfits i have a very clear  
A3QhFD9g43w,1370320,1377759,favorite and the clear favorite is the vest suit  trouser outfit it was the most me outfit out of  
A3QhFD9g43w,1377760,1382480,everything and it fit the brief perfectly now  this experiment is done i do think that the  
A3QhFD9g43w,1382480,1387200,more expensive stylists offered looks that had  a slightly more high fashion edge they followed  
A3QhFD9g43w,1387200,1393039,the brief closer than the cheaper stylist did and  they had kind of a slightly more elevated level  
A3QhFD9g43w,1393040,1398000,of fashion to them or at least in my opinion  the cheaper stylist provided looks that were  
A3QhFD9g43w,1398000,1402480,more casual in a way that i felt like maybe they  were a bit more accessible in terms of wearing  
A3QhFD9g43w,1402480,1407120,them every day whereas the more expensive stylus  definitely had looks that were instagramable  
A3QhFD9g43w,1407120,1413440,but potentially not the kind of thing you'd wear  out on an average day i do think that if you are  
A3QhFD9g43w,1413440,1418399,someone who struggles putting together outfits or  just has a hard time with fashion in general and  
A3QhFD9g43w,1418400,1423680,wants to try and branch out their style the $20  personal stylist was pretty good value the more  
A3QhFD9g43w,1423680,1428400,expensive stylist is definitely an investment  and there were some outfits in there that  
A3QhFD9g43w,1429520,1435600,i'm gonna say we're too high fashion for me maybe  but my favorite outfit from this entire series was  
A3QhFD9g43w,1435600,1441520,made by the more expensive personal stylist yes  granted it was a two-piece set that was already  
A3QhFD9g43w,1441520,1446480,available on the website they didn't necessarily  come up with it themselves but i would never have  
A3QhFD9g43w,1446480,1451200,found their outfit on my own because i didn't even  know that brand existed and when you're paying for  
A3QhFD9g43w,1451200,1455440,a personal stylist that is expensive like this  you're paying not only for their knowledge of  
A3QhFD9g43w,1455440,1459919,how clothes go together but their knowledge of  brands in general they have a wider knowledge of  
A3QhFD9g43w,1459920,1464640,the fashion industry and therefore may help you  discover your new favorite brand i am continuing  
A3QhFD9g43w,1464640,1468640,my fashion journey on tick tock it's ellbat over  there there's a link down below if you want to

A3QhFD9g43w,1505920,1514000,a bit of a meme but as you can see it i cannot fit  it on it is very small neon pink has never been my  
A3QhFD9g43w,1514000,1518400,color i'm just going to be honest i feel like  this could be very cute on someone who isn't me
