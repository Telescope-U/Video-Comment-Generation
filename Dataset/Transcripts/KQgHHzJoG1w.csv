KQgHHzJoG1w,67680,72799,really helpful for the blueberries with  this sand the water can rain quickly
KQgHHzJoG1w,72799,80159,which is super important because  blueberries do not grow in a lot of  water so this stands really fun to play

KQgHHzJoG1w,943680,948959,whoa this is what you had outside oh  that's right  it must make it much easier when the

KQgHHzJoG1w,954880,960880,can i put the helmet right here you  certainly can  so the first thing we're going to do is
KQgHHzJoG1w,960880,965920,remove your front wheel no  so you're going to remove the
KQgHHzJoG1w,965920,972079,front wheel and tire correct whoa so we  will take this 15 millimeter box wrench
KQgHHzJoG1w,972079,979759,and loosen the axle nuts on the wheel  wow  you know a lot about bikes
KQgHHzJoG1w,980000,986639,whoa look at this  it's a bicycle i did not want to ride a  bike like that i know now it's a
KQgHHzJoG1w,986639,992639,unicycle  next we're going to take a tire lever
KQgHHzJoG1w,992639,998720,to remove the tire from the wheel  so you're removing the tire from the
KQgHHzJoG1w,998720,1006000,wheel right now oh you got it and just  like that  whoa so cool can i see the wheel
KQgHHzJoG1w,1006000,1012399,whoa check it out mika wow  bike wheel with no tire yeah look a big
KQgHHzJoG1w,1012399,1017720,circle  yeah  cool really cool and it's actually kind  of light yeah
KQgHHzJoG1w,1017720,1024480,[Music]  okay and the next thing we're going to  do is remove that tube which is what
KQgHHzJoG1w,1024480,1030640,created the flat tire whoa so there's a  tube inside the tire oh can i check it
KQgHHzJoG1w,1030640,1035918,out  whoa  so this has a hole in it and this is
KQgHHzJoG1w,1035918,1044400,what was  inside the tire that makes sense  oh it's squishy yeah it is
KQgHHzJoG1w,1044400,1051440,it's like a balloon yeah cool  so as we're now done inspecting the tire
KQgHHzJoG1w,1051440,1058400,to see if there's anything stuck inside  of this that created the flat we're now  safe to put a new tube
KQgHHzJoG1w,1058400,1066600,back inside oh okay so it's just the  tube that had the hole yeah you're gonna  get a brand new
KQgHHzJoG1w,1071360,1076640,that is this  but brand new  exactly  so what we're going to do is fill it up
KQgHHzJoG1w,1076640,1082160,with a little bit of air to make it  easier to install  whoa
KQgHHzJoG1w,1082160,1087700,cool  look at it it's getting blown up  [Applause]
KQgHHzJoG1w,1087700,1093280,[Music]  next  we will need that their wheel back here
KQgHHzJoG1w,1093280,1099039,yeah  one wheel one wheel thank you
KQgHHzJoG1w,1099039,1106400,and so we're gonna set just one side of  this wheel inside  of the rim itself okay
KQgHHzJoG1w,1106400,1114559,and this is where i like to create a  dinner plate  dinner plate i love dinner
KQgHHzJoG1w,1114559,1122000,whoa  wow so what are you doing now  i'm gonna insert and reinstall a new
KQgHHzJoG1w,1122000,1128160,inner tube to replace the compromised  one  and you can see once you have it set up
KQgHHzJoG1w,1128160,1133600,like a dinner plate it's easy enough to  just  add it back inside of the
KQgHHzJoG1w,1133600,1140559,the  tire now we're gonna re-seat the other  side just like that and now we have a
KQgHHzJoG1w,1140559,1147200,fully  re-uh installed tire yeah
KQgHHzJoG1w,1147360,1154720,so last but not least we're going to put  air pressure back into the tire  this specific tire goes up to 40
KQgHHzJoG1w,1154720,1160480,psi or pounds per square inch can i hold  the tire and wheel certainly
KQgHHzJoG1w,1160480,1166160,okay see if we can feel the air being  pumped in there yeah oh yeah  whoa
KQgHHzJoG1w,1166160,1171280,it is feeling like a normal bike tire  now that's really filling up yeah
KQgHHzJoG1w,1171280,1177200,whoa  so when doing this you always want to  read the side of your tire first before
KQgHHzJoG1w,1177200,1185919,you start to apply air pressure okay and  that way you won't over inflate the tire  oh so it doesn't explode makes sense
KQgHHzJoG1w,1185919,1191520,wow now this feels like a bike wheel  that you can ride on yeah yeah and now
KQgHHzJoG1w,1191520,1197600,it is so last but not least  you're gonna reinstall this back
KQgHHzJoG1w,1197600,1204000,onto the bicycle  so that you may continue your ride yay
KQgHHzJoG1w,1204000,1208799,i'm so excited to ride my bicycle again
