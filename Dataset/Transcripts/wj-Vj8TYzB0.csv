wj-Vj8TYzB0,2000,10000,"Before we start with the unboxing there are 2-3 things which i have to tell you, this the third Note 11"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,11000,22000,"2 of them have launched in China one of them is 4G, and the top variant is on Dimensity 810"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,23000,31000,This has launched globally which is on SD 680 & this is going to launch in India in a couple of days
wj-Vj8TYzB0,36000,42000,"There will be some changes when it launches in India, we ordered this from Dubai"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,46000,51000,"If you like our unboxing, make sure to like & subscribe to the channel"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,64000,66000,There are a lot of documentation probably because its a global variant
wj-Vj8TYzB0,103000,112000,"The design is understated, the sides are flat with a bit of a curve, it has a 3.5mm jack with an IR blaster"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,123000,125000, It weighs 177.7gms
wj-Vj8TYzB0,130000,136000," It feels great in hand, even if you have small hands you can handle this easily"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,138000,142000,The battery is 5000mAh so I thought it would slightly be on the heavier side
wj-Vj8TYzB0,147000,153000," Let's check the sim card slot, it should have a dedicated slot in this price range, it does have a dedicated slot"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,154000,156000,So you can expand it
wj-Vj8TYzB0,168000,171000,The case quality is not that great
wj-Vj8TYzB0,177000,190000,In the global variant they did not say anything about the gorilla glass but most probably it will have because
wj-Vj8TYzB0,191000,197000, Redmi Note 10 had it. The power on/off button is also a fingerprint sensor. Side mounted fingerprint sensors
wj-Vj8TYzB0,198000,200000,Have become common these days
wj-Vj8TYzB0,211000,221000,"I think this is probably one of 2-3 phones which comes on SD680 processor, the realmi 9i comes too but the specifications are not that great"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,225000,231000," This might be available for around Rs 15K, because the specifications are good"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,233000,242000,"It has a 6.43’’ FHD+ AMOLED display, with 90Hz refresh rate and 1K nits brightness, generally"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,243000,245000,You don't get so much brightness at this price range
wj-Vj8TYzB0,250000,254000,"It does not have a budget phone display, looks premium"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,256000,262000, But the specifications are average because it comes on SD 680 which is a 4G processor
wj-Vj8TYzB0,269000,272000,5G is coming to India this year
wj-Vj8TYzB0,274000,286000,"We have the 6GB+ 128GB variant, the base variant might be 4GB + 64GB this might have 2-3 more variants"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,287000,288000,We have the top variant
wj-Vj8TYzB0,291000,293000,It comes on MIUI 13 which is based on android 11
wj-Vj8TYzB0,301000,310000,"The antutu score on paper was 262511, but while gaming we could only play on low-medium settings"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,311000,324000,"We cannot play on high settings, probably because its GPU is new, it might get an upgrade after the update"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,326000,335000,"The performance is great for normal usage and normal games, but you cannot play at high settings"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,336000,346000,"It has a quad-camera setup with 50MP camera the previous one had 48MP, ultra-wide of 8MP, 2MP depth & 2MP macro"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,347000,357000," The 50MP photos are really great, the colors, sharpness & skin tones are all good"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,363000,371000,"The colors shifts a lot, the images come out soft"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,375000,381000,I was expecting the macro to be good because Xiaomi phones have good macro camera but not this one
wj-Vj8TYzB0,384000,392000,"The selfie center punch hole is 13MP, I’ll show some samples on screen but i did not like the camera"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,394000,399000,"The colors are off, skin tones are average and dynamic range is not that good too"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,409000,415000,One more thing that was a downgrade in comparison to Note 10 was this does not have 4K video filming
wj-Vj8TYzB0,417000,427000,"Now before it launches in India, the post-processing might change, we’ll do the review of the Indian variant"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,432000,434000," It has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, face unlock and if you wanna know rest of the MIUI13 features"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,435000,440000,Go on watch our video specifically made on MIUI13
wj-Vj8TYzB0,441000,448000,"This variant does not have an IP rating, but the Indian variant might have it, it has a widevine L1 & camera2API support"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,449000,452000,It has a FM radio but no notification light
wj-Vj8TYzB0,454000,468000,The haptic feedback was good considering it is a budget phone & one more feature you don't get in this price range is AOD
wj-Vj8TYzB0,476000,480000,We all know the quality of speakers in a Rs 15K phone
wj-Vj8TYzB0,485000,495000,"The display is great, viewing angles and colors are also good, the stereo speakers are loud"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,503000,507000,This phone is really great in some features but also not that good in some
wj-Vj8TYzB0,511000,521000,"There is no 5G from the Note 9 series, this one does not have it too"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,524000,535000,"The processor is good when it comes to battery, it can last for 2-3 days but it lacks in performance"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,538000,547000,Excluding the 50MP camera rest all the cameras are not that great
wj-Vj8TYzB0,552000,564000,"The display is good which we don't expect in this price range, the speaker quality & in-hand feel both are great"
wj-Vj8TYzB0,565000,570000,So it is a balance between really good & bad things
wj-Vj8TYzB0,573000,578000,If you have any questions drop them in the comment section also like & share the video
wj-Vj8TYzB0,579000,582000,"That's all for this video, until the next one Keep Trakin & Stay Safe"
