bLPCVGigTrw,23333,28533,"So don't be lazy in learning, don't be lazy in gathering the library that'll teach you and instruct you."
bLPCVGigTrw,29233,32933,Money doesn't make you sophisticated. Only study and practice makes you sophisticated.
bLPCVGigTrw,33200,35466,Only study and practice makes you cultured.
bLPCVGigTrw,36666,40700,And only study and practice makes you happy. Study and practice makes you rich.
bLPCVGigTrw,42633,44966,Key phrase: “Don't be lazy in learning”.
bLPCVGigTrw,46133,50365,"One, how to do well. Next, how to live well."
bLPCVGigTrw,50800,54033,Don't be lazy in learning and practicing the art of economics.
bLPCVGigTrw,54033,58066,Practicing the art of productivity and practicing the art of lifestyle.
bLPCVGigTrw,58666,63233,Success is a numbers game. I'm asking you to be mature enough
bLPCVGigTrw,63233,67233,to start checking your own numbers. How many books have you read in the last ninety days?
bLPCVGigTrw,67233,75333,"Transform your life, become cultured, powerful, sophisticated, healthy, influential,"
bLPCVGigTrw,75333,79266,all the rest of the stuff you want. How many books? How many classes?
bLPCVGigTrw,79666,86133,How committed are you to taking what's available and turning it into equities unprecedented?
bLPCVGigTrw,86133,91166,Since we live in a country that there's been no such country in the last six and a half thousand years.
bLPCVGigTrw,91400,92533,Get smart!
bLPCVGigTrw,93800,99400,That's what these journals are for. That's what pad and pencil's for. That's what taking notes is for.
bLPCVGigTrw,99400,106833,"See if you can increase your ability to comprehend ideas, information that can be life transforming."
bLPCVGigTrw,107600,114033,"Don't miss the opportunity to learn. Take a good key phrase home, use it in your training: “Don't be lazy in learning”."
bLPCVGigTrw,115900,117466,Don't be casual in learning.
bLPCVGigTrw,118566,121000,"Develop a whole new intensity for the nineties,"
bLPCVGigTrw,121000,124266,"that you're not gonna miss the information, you're not gonna miss the stories."
bLPCVGigTrw,124633,126333,You're not gonna miss the details.
bLPCVGigTrw,127533,128500,Get smart!
bLPCVGigTrw,130399,134666,"Here's a couple of parts to it. Number one, your own personal experience."
bLPCVGigTrw,135800,140266,"Right? If you've had a bad week, just sit down and ponder that for a while, study it."
bLPCVGigTrw,140266,145100,See if you can pick up some ideas from a poor week and then make a better week.
bLPCVGigTrw,146033,146866,Okay?
bLPCVGigTrw,147466,149133,Learn from your own experiences.
bLPCVGigTrw,149800,154133,"One way to learn to do it right is, do it wrong."
bLPCVGigTrw,154133,156366,"Alright I know, that's one way to learn to do it right,"
bLPCVGigTrw,156366,159700,do it wrong. Now the key is don't let it take too long.
bLPCVGigTrw,162833,165732,"If you've done it wrong for a year, we suggest that's long enough."
bLPCVGigTrw,165900,171166,"You don't need another year just to prove a point. No, one year's enough."
bLPCVGigTrw,172466,178200,This is called the possibility for life change starts with education. Don't be lazy in learning.
bLPCVGigTrw,178833,181099,Don't be lazy in picking up the ideas.
bLPCVGigTrw,181533,183833,Don't be lazy in learning from your own experience.
bLPCVGigTrw,184466,186866,Learning is the beginning of wealth.
bLPCVGigTrw,187900,190433,Learning is the beginning of life change.
bLPCVGigTrw,191366,194300,"Some people wanna start with motivation, but you don't start with motivation."
bLPCVGigTrw,194966,198333,"Someone says, “Just motivate this guy, he'll be all right”. The answer is no, probably not."
bLPCVGigTrw,199100,204066,"If a guy is an idiot, you motivate him, now you got a motivated idiot. No!"
bLPCVGigTrw,209666,214200,"So, education. Get smart. Don't miss the training class."
bLPCVGigTrw,214600,218266,"You say, well, I've already been to one of those classes. I've already heard it."
bLPCVGigTrw,218266,221033,I got a good phrase for you to take home: “That's no sign you got it”.
bLPCVGigTrw,222666,225766,"Just because you've listened to those millionaire tapes one time, no sign you've got it."
bLPCVGigTrw,225766,229333,I'm asking you to listen to them over and over and over.
bLPCVGigTrw,229333,232965,I'm asking you to dedicate yourself to a new level of learning.
bLPCVGigTrw,233433,236700,"You know, study, learn, grow, change, develop."
bLPCVGigTrw,237033,238800,Never let it be said you didn't learn.
bLPCVGigTrw,239433,241733,"Right? If you wanna solve your problems, you gotta learn."
bLPCVGigTrw,241733,244333,"If you wanna take advantage of an opportunity, you gotta learn."
bLPCVGigTrw,244900,248232,"Develop your own personal philosophy here. Philosophy,"
bLPCVGigTrw,248233,252600,"major determining factor in how your life works out. Each person's philosophy,"
bLPCVGigTrw,252600,254233,is like the set of the sail.
bLPCVGigTrw,255166,257133,The same wind blows on us all.
bLPCVGigTrw,257833,260299,"The difference in where we arrive at the end of the week, at the end of the month,"
bLPCVGigTrw,260299,262500,at the end of the year is not the wind that blows.
bLPCVGigTrw,263266,264766,But what's gonna make the major difference?
bLPCVGigTrw,264766,268699,"Each person's personal philosophy that sets a better sail, sets a better sail."
bLPCVGigTrw,269266,271766,So don't ask for a more favorable wind.
bLPCVGigTrw,271766,274266,That's like wishing something that's not gonna occur.
bLPCVGigTrw,274733,278233,Don't ask for better seed and soil. All you got's what's available.
bLPCVGigTrw,278600,279900,Don't curse what you got.
bLPCVGigTrw,280833,285766,The key is to set a better sail and turn what you've got into the miracle of your future.
bLPCVGigTrw,286166,289699,"Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better."
bLPCVGigTrw,290500,294166,"Don't wish for less problems, wish for more skills."
bLPCVGigTrw,294966,298866,"That's the reason for coming here, spending a couple of days of intense effort."
bLPCVGigTrw,298866,301432,"Taking notes, rolling up your sleeves, going to work."
bLPCVGigTrw,301433,305933,"Commit yourself to learning, so that you can get smarter for the days ahead."
bLPCVGigTrw,306333,308300,Life is worthwhile if you learn.
bLPCVGigTrw,309633,311866,You gotta know. You gotta have the information.
bLPCVGigTrw,312066,315566,"When I talk to the kids in school, that's what I say. Get the information while you're here."
bLPCVGigTrw,315700,317500,"What you're gonna do with it, that's up to you."
bLPCVGigTrw,317700,322933,"Throw it all away, that's up to you. Just use a little of it, that's up to you. But while you're here, get it all."
bLPCVGigTrw,323500,328900,"So, jot this down now, as I used in my notes: “What you don't know will hurt you”."
bLPCVGigTrw,329366,331900,Ignorance is not bliss.
bLPCVGigTrw,332866,334633,Ignorance is tragedy.
bLPCVGigTrw,334633,336432,Ignorance is illness.
bLPCVGigTrw,336433,338100,Ignorance is devastation.
bLPCVGigTrw,338100,339933,Ignorance is going broke.
bLPCVGigTrw,340833,343766,Ignorances creates a poor life.
bLPCVGigTrw,345066,347500,"So you gotta know, you gotta have the information."
bLPCVGigTrw,348933,351100,"Number one, learn from your personal experience."
bLPCVGigTrw,352466,355800,"One way to learn to do it right is first, mess it up and do it wrong."
bLPCVGigTrw,355800,357866,That doesn't mean it's the end of your life.
bLPCVGigTrw,358366,361500,"But just, you know, clean up the mess, now, do it right."
bLPCVGigTrw,363700,369333,"From a negative experience, sometimes we learn to do the positive things that saves our life and makes us successful."
bLPCVGigTrw,369866,380266,"They say, if you survive your first heart attack, if you survive, you may now live to be a very old person."
bLPCVGigTrw,381433,385066,Why is that? That first heart attack was a wake up call.
bLPCVGigTrw,385466,392366,"And then maybe the doctor said, another one of these and you're history and you say, Wow!"
bLPCVGigTrw,392800,395233,And you make it for the health food store.
bLPCVGigTrw,395800,398733,And you start reading every book you could read on health and nutrition.
bLPCVGigTrw,398733,402433,And you start doing the pushups and you start jogging on the beach and doing all the stuff.
bLPCVGigTrw,402433,407766,"And all of that change now could very well help you to live a long, long life."
bLPCVGigTrw,407966,412200,Having been alerted in an alarm system that serves you well.
bLPCVGigTrw,412966,416966,So learn from your negative as well as your positive experiences.
bLPCVGigTrw,417133,423033,"Here's the next, learn from other people's experiences. That's how you get smarter in a shorter period of time."
bLPCVGigTrw,423333,426266,Somebody that's been through it for five years and they wrote a book.
bLPCVGigTrw,427233,430133,"And the book, if you read it, could save you five years."
bLPCVGigTrw,430900,434166,Cost? Thirty dollars.
bLPCVGigTrw,436233,439433,"See you just, you can't miss that kind of education."
bLPCVGigTrw,441700,444733,"Best to get the information before. Yes, we can recover."
bLPCVGigTrw,444733,448300,"Yes, we can come back from bankruptcy and disaster and poor health."
bLPCVGigTrw,448566,454433,"But wow, if we had the information up front, that would save us some of those years of disaster."
bLPCVGigTrw,454900,460866,"How much better that would be? So learn from other people's experiences, both negative and positive."
bLPCVGigTrw,464766,469533,"Develop the ability to absorb, the ability to get everything."
bLPCVGigTrw,469900,472166,I don't know what all you've planned here but
bLPCVGigTrw,472166,477199,"you know, be in every class, you possibly can. Just stay as long as you can."
bLPCVGigTrw,477200,480566,"The key is not to be careless in the gathering of knowledge,"
bLPCVGigTrw,480566,484633,"not to be casual in the ideas that could double your health,"
bLPCVGigTrw,484633,492932,"triple your income, accelerate your career, secure your fortune, amplify your harvest."
bLPCVGigTrw,493266,498300,"So, don't be careless in the gathering of ideas. Absorb every one you possibly can."
bLPCVGigTrw,499300,502733,"The whole world is governed by laws, the universe, in fact."
bLPCVGigTrw,503200,507333,Laws. We call it the law of electricity. We call it the law of gravity.
bLPCVGigTrw,507800,515766,"There's mathematical laws, there's physical laws, speed and velocity laws, agricultural laws. There's all kinds of laws."
bLPCVGigTrw,516700,522033,"Now that we find ourselves on the spinning planet, you just have to learn what I call the “Setup”."
bLPCVGigTrw,523133,528200,"Learn the setup, life's setup."
bLPCVGigTrw,530733,534733,"Now we didn't set it up, but we're here, so you got to learn it."
bLPCVGigTrw,535600,540466,"And we should learn this setup for two basic reasons. Number one, to keep from getting hurt."
bLPCVGigTrw,541000,543633,"It's one of the major reasons for learning, so you won't get hurt."
bLPCVGigTrw,545500,548700,"See economically, socially, personally, you can get hurt just not knowing."
bLPCVGigTrw,550400,552933,Ignorance is not bliss.
bLPCVGigTrw,553900,559233,"Ignorance is poverty, ignorance is tragedy. You gotta know or you're gonna get hurt."
bLPCVGigTrw,561733,565532,It's good to know not to walk out the ten storey window. That's excellent information.
bLPCVGigTrw,566933,570165,Now what if a guy didn’t know and he walks out? Now he's dead at the bottom.
bLPCVGigTrw,570166,571966,"Somebody says, “Well, the poor guy didn't know”."
bLPCVGigTrw,573700,577033,"You gotta know, or you're gonna get hurt."
bLPCVGigTrw,578933,581233,"Okay, now here's a parenthesis."
bLPCVGigTrw,582333,584133,You don't have to like the setup.
bLPCVGigTrw,585766,587966,I don't ask you to like how it is.
bLPCVGigTrw,589300,593532,"That's not what's important, but it is important to learn how it is."
bLPCVGigTrw,595266,598500,"Okay, so you don't have to like it, but you should learn it."
bLPCVGigTrw,599766,603566,"That's what I tell the kids, right? Make sure you get the information."
bLPCVGigTrw,605600,609399,"What you think about it, that's up to you. What you're gonna do with it, that will soon be up to you."
bLPCVGigTrw,609500,611300,But make sure you get it.
bLPCVGigTrw,612766,616733,"See, there's nothing worse than being stupid, nothing."
bLPCVGigTrw,618166,622366,"I mean, being broke is bad, but being stupid is awful."
bLPCVGigTrw,624300,627365,"And what's really bad is being broke and stupid, right?"
bLPCVGigTrw,628300,633133,"That's about the end of the world. I mean, there isn't anything much worse than that, unless you're sick."
bLPCVGigTrw,634133,639133,"Sick, broke and stupid. I mean, that is it. Right? There's nowhere else to go."
bLPCVGigTrw,641200,644866,"So, make sure you get the information, it's key."
bLPCVGigTrw,645400,647933,"You don't have to like it, but learn it."
bLPCVGigTrw,649066,651300,It's called your basic smart.
bLPCVGigTrw,652866,657566,"So number one, learn so you won't get hurt, whether you like it or not. Learn."
bLPCVGigTrw,658066,661966,"Now, here's the second reason for learning the setup: “To benefit”."
bLPCVGigTrw,663300,668966,"It's called the plus of life, and that's what life is, right, both minus and plus."
bLPCVGigTrw,669666,675133,"The minus is tragedy, heartache, misery, failure, unhappiness."
bLPCVGigTrw,676133,679433,"But life is also happiness, prosperity, good feelings."
bLPCVGigTrw,679900,685166,"So, here's the key: Learn to get on the good side of the way things work."
bLPCVGigTrw,686800,692032,"Now, in transforming our lives, we don't start with attitude, we don't start with the inspiration here."
bLPCVGigTrw,692400,693833,We start with education.
bLPCVGigTrw,694800,700399,"Somebody says, “Well, I expected you just come get motivated today”. Well, that probably won't do it."
bLPCVGigTrw,701500,707533,"No, that's not where you start. Life change does not start with inspiration, life change starts with education."
bLPCVGigTrw,708766,712133,You gotta be educated to the point of where you might have messed up.
bLPCVGigTrw,713066,718000,"My teacher put it in blunt, simple language. He only went to the ninth grade in school, so,"
bLPCVGigTrw,718000,719866,"he put it in simple language, I could understand."
bLPCVGigTrw,720100,723300,"He said Mr Rohn, after six years living in America,"
bLPCVGigTrw,723300,727266,"healthy American male, twenty-five years old, been working six years, one year of college,"
bLPCVGigTrw,727266,731000,"pennies in your pocket, nothing in the bank, behind on your promises."
bLPCVGigTrw,731300,735066,"Shoaff said, I just got one simple explanation for that: You've messed up."
bLPCVGigTrw,736366,738400,"Now, I could understand that kind of language."
bLPCVGigTrw,739833,744800,"Should walk around the block, could walk around the block, won't walk around the block."
bLPCVGigTrw,744800,749666,You have messed up and all you got to go is write down through the list.
bLPCVGigTrw,750000,754533,"Don't need some teacher to come by and tell you. Be your own best teacher saying, “Hey,"
bLPCVGigTrw,754533,756833,let me make a list of some places I've messed up”.
bLPCVGigTrw,757100,762165,"Because if I let this down, let this down, that probably affects the rest? And the answer is that's true."
bLPCVGigTrw,763333,765800,"So, we don't start with inspiration, we start with education."
bLPCVGigTrw,765933,769032,"Someone says, “Well, just motivate this guy, he'll be all right. Just motivate him, get him turned on”."
bLPCVGigTrw,769200,770200,Probably not.
bLPCVGigTrw,771000,773866,"If a guy's an idiot, you motivate him, now you got a motivated idiot."
bLPCVGigTrw,776100,777133,"No, it won't be alright."
bLPCVGigTrw,781900,784333,So we start with education. What's the first education?
bLPCVGigTrw,784666,792066,"If it isn't going well and you live in America, you have messed up. You don't need to change countries."
bLPCVGigTrw,793900,797066,"You say, “Well, the country's messed up”. That's like cursing the soil"
bLPCVGigTrw,797066,801966,"and cursing the seed and the sunshine and the rain, which is all you got. Don't curse all you got."
bLPCVGigTrw,803566,806466,"When you get your own planet, you can rearrange this whole deal, but"
bLPCVGigTrw,808100,810000,"this one, you got to take like it comes."
bLPCVGigTrw,810833,813033,"He said, “How many books have you read in the last ninety days”?"
bLPCVGigTrw,814733,815399,"I said, What?"
bLPCVGigTrw,817500,822666,"Zero. Wisdom of the world available. Change your life, change your future."
bLPCVGigTrw,822666,827100,"Wisdom of the world available. Develop any skill you want, earn the kind of income you want."
bLPCVGigTrw,827100,830500,"Have all the treasures you want, equities you want. Relationship with your family that you want."
bLPCVGigTrw,830500,834000,Everything that you want available and the wisdom of the world to help you get it.
bLPCVGigTrw,834266,838700,"Haven't read any books in the last ninety days. My teacher said, “Mr. Rohn,"
bLPCVGigTrw,838700,843133,"you have messed up”. I'm telling you, you've got to deal."
bLPCVGigTrw,844433,847933,"Shoaff said, “Mr Rohn, in the last six months, how many classes have you taken"
bLPCVGigTrw,848466,852333,to improve your skills or to develop new skills?”
bLPCVGigTrw,853000,858066,"Go for the American dream, become rich and powerful and sophisticated and healthy and influential."
bLPCVGigTrw,859000,862500,"How many classes have you taken in the last six months? I said, How many?"
bLPCVGigTrw,863266,869566,"Zero. He said, “You have messed up”. He said, “You don't need to unmess the country."
bLPCVGigTrw,869566,873199,You don't need to straighten out the perplexed. You don't need to straighten out any of this stuff.
bLPCVGigTrw,873200,877433,All you got to do is look within and let results teach you
bLPCVGigTrw,877433,884233,"a great deal about your own activity, your own attitude and your own philosophy”."
bLPCVGigTrw,885533,886866,I went through that process.
bLPCVGigTrw,887866,891466,Take this phrase home: Results is the name of the game.
bLPCVGigTrw,891933,893300,What other game is there?
bLPCVGigTrw,898833,901633,Part of this personal development challenge is to develop mentally.
bLPCVGigTrw,902733,907165,"Learn, study, grow, change. It's what schooling is all about."
bLPCVGigTrw,908100,912899,"And the human development takes time, incredible amounts of time."
bLPCVGigTrw,914300,920000,It's why we've taken the time for this seminar. It just takes time. Some things you can't cover in a 20 minute speech.
bLPCVGigTrw,920700,924300,"You can't cover in a little five minute talk, it takes time."
bLPCVGigTrw,925333,929533,"For humans, it takes, seem like more time than any other life form, human beings."
bLPCVGigTrw,930933,934066,"The little wilderbeast in Africa,"
bLPCVGigTrw,934066,937165,guess how much time it's got as soon as it's born to be able
bLPCVGigTrw,937166,940166,to run with the pack so it doesn't get eaten by the lions?
bLPCVGigTrw,941466,944400,Guess how much time it's got? A few minutes.
bLPCVGigTrw,945533,950633,"Not hours, not days. Minutes."
bLPCVGigTrw,951533,955566,Wow. But the human baby. Wow.
bLPCVGigTrw,956366,964033,"After sixteen years, we're not sure. Unbelievable amount of time it takes."
bLPCVGigTrw,967100,972566,"So, it does take time for personal development, does take time for spiritual development, physical development."
bLPCVGigTrw,973666,976533,"But here's also what takes time, and that's your mental development."
bLPCVGigTrw,976900,980800,Feeding the mind. Nourishing the mind.
bLPCVGigTrw,981800,984633,Some people read so little they got rickets of the mind.
bLPCVGigTrw,986600,990266,"They couldn't give you a good, strong argument as to their own personal beliefs."
bLPCVGigTrw,991933,994466,"I'm telling you, you gotta be able to pick up those ideologies."
bLPCVGigTrw,994466,996233,You gotta be able to pick up the philosophy.
bLPCVGigTrw,996233,998800,And here's the next part: You gotta be able to defend it.
bLPCVGigTrw,999033,1006300,"If you can't defend your virtues and if you can't defend your values, I'm telling you, even in the nineties,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1006300,1011100,you'll fall prey to philosophies that are not in your best interest.
bLPCVGigTrw,1011733,1014633,You gotta get yourself ready. And one of the ways you gotta get ready
bLPCVGigTrw,1014633,1019133,"is not just physical and not just spiritual, you gotta get ready mentally."
bLPCVGigTrw,1020500,1023933,"And this is where Shoaff went to work on me, to be ready mentally,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1025233,1029400,to develop the philosophy and also be able to defend your virtues and your values.
bLPCVGigTrw,1030833,1032733,"Don't be a follower, be a student."
bLPCVGigTrw,1034865,1039065,You'd be happy to know today we haven't come seeking disciples.
bLPCVGigTrw,1039066,1041300,We've got no movement for you to join.
bLPCVGigTrw,1042133,1046133,"I'm just here to share some of my experiences, good ideas, best I can."
bLPCVGigTrw,1047133,1051200,"But I think that's good advice: “Don't be a follower, be a student”. Right?"
bLPCVGigTrw,1051500,1053266,"Take advice, but not orders."
bLPCVGigTrw,1054533,1058033,"Take information but don't let somebody, you know, order your life."
bLPCVGigTrw,1058033,1060866,Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion.
bLPCVGigTrw,1061133,1066933,Excellent note to make: Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion.
bLPCVGigTrw,1067833,1069466,Not to do what someone else says.
bLPCVGigTrw,1070966,1074600,"Take what someone else says, process it, think about it, ponder it."
bLPCVGigTrw,1075466,1078600,"If it makes you wonder, if it makes you think, then it's valuable."
bLPCVGigTrw,1079166,1083166,"Then when you go take action, make sure that the action is not what somebody told you to do."
bLPCVGigTrw,1083166,1085966,Make sure the action is the product of your own conclusion.
bLPCVGigTrw,1087066,1091600,"If you'll follow just a little bit of those simple guidelines,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1091600,1095600,"I'm telling you the learning process can be speedy, swift, powerful."
bLPCVGigTrw,1095900,1099300,"Your learning curve can go up and then applying it to your business, your life,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1099300,1102500,"your family, conversations, equities of all kinds."
bLPCVGigTrw,1102500,1105800,You'll find some progress like I did that first five years
bLPCVGigTrw,1105800,1108200,when I met a teacher willing to share with me.
bLPCVGigTrw,1108200,1112600,"Turned my life around, progress I couldn't believe happened for me."
bLPCVGigTrw,1114200,1116266,Develop the ability to reflect.
bLPCVGigTrw,1117266,1119100,"Part of this, is in the challenge when you go home,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1119100,1123466,"not to just put these notes away, but to get them out, maybe"
bLPCVGigTrw,1123466,1127065,"fairly often over the next thirty days, sixty days, ninety days,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1127066,1132733,"just to review the notes, to drive the ideas a little deeper, to come up with a little more refinement."
bLPCVGigTrw,1133466,1137700,"And if you go back over these notes, I promise you, there is something you will discover"
bLPCVGigTrw,1137700,1141132,that you just didn't have the time to discover while you were taking the notes.
bLPCVGigTrw,1141633,1145600,That's why review is so important. Go back over it again. Go back over it again.
bLPCVGigTrw,1145866,1148166,Here's what I call it: Run the tapes again.
bLPCVGigTrw,1148766,1151400,The tape in your mind and the tape from your notes.
bLPCVGigTrw,1151966,1154933,And see if you can capture something you might have missed.
bLPCVGigTrw,1155566,1159766,"Or to develop an extension of something you got, now that by going back over it, now you can see."
bLPCVGigTrw,1159766,1162666,Now I see. Here's what I could do with that
bLPCVGigTrw,1162666,1165866,"that might multiply the value of my life by two, by three, by five."
bLPCVGigTrw,1168366,1170600,"Here's a good time to reflect, when the day is over."
bLPCVGigTrw,1171366,1173966,How did it go and who did you see and what did you say?
bLPCVGigTrw,1174333,1178366,What mistakes did you make and what did you leave out that you could correct tomorrow?
bLPCVGigTrw,1181533,1183232,Reflect at the end of the month.
bLPCVGigTrw,1183933,1189132,"Thirty days, that's when you usually do the accounting for your business and the company and the corporation."
bLPCVGigTrw,1189300,1193866,"Do the accounting for your health. If you needed to lose weight, how many pounds have you lost?"
bLPCVGigTrw,1194333,1196700,Just do a good reflective accounting.
bLPCVGigTrw,1198400,1201933,How did it go? Where did you stumble? What did you miss?
bLPCVGigTrw,1201933,1204866,What should you have thought of that you let pass?
bLPCVGigTrw,1206200,1211399,Who didn't you see? Just review the last six days.
bLPCVGigTrw,1211400,1215100,What went right? What went wrong? What's there? What's missing?
bLPCVGigTrw,1216400,1219400,"Then here's what you do: Now, plan the next six days."
bLPCVGigTrw,1219766,1223600,"With this information of the last six, plan the next six."
bLPCVGigTrw,1225033,1228666,You will be absolutely surprised
bLPCVGigTrw,1228666,1233366,"at the value and the productivity of your weeks, if you'll start doing a little more of that."

bLPCVGigTrw,58666,63233,Success is a numbers game. I'm asking you to be mature enough
bLPCVGigTrw,63233,67233,to start checking your own numbers. How many books have you read in the last ninety days?
bLPCVGigTrw,67233,75333,"Transform your life, become cultured, powerful, sophisticated, healthy, influential,"
bLPCVGigTrw,75333,79266,all the rest of the stuff you want. How many books? How many classes?

bLPCVGigTrw,127533,128500,Get smart!
bLPCVGigTrw,130399,134666,"Here's a couple of parts to it. Number one, your own personal experience."
bLPCVGigTrw,135800,140266,"Right? If you've had a bad week, just sit down and ponder that for a while, study it."
bLPCVGigTrw,140266,145100,See if you can pick up some ideas from a poor week and then make a better week.
bLPCVGigTrw,146033,146866,Okay?
bLPCVGigTrw,147466,149133,Learn from your own experiences.
bLPCVGigTrw,149800,154133,"One way to learn to do it right is, do it wrong."
bLPCVGigTrw,154133,156366,"Alright I know, that's one way to learn to do it right,"
bLPCVGigTrw,156366,159700,do it wrong. Now the key is don't let it take too long.
bLPCVGigTrw,162833,165732,"If you've done it wrong for a year, we suggest that's long enough."
bLPCVGigTrw,165900,171166,"You don't need another year just to prove a point. No, one year's enough."
bLPCVGigTrw,172466,178200,This is called the possibility for life change starts with education. Don't be lazy in learning.
bLPCVGigTrw,178833,181099,Don't be lazy in picking up the ideas.

bLPCVGigTrw,209666,214200,"So, education. Get smart. Don't miss the training class."
bLPCVGigTrw,214600,218266,"You say, well, I've already been to one of those classes. I've already heard it."
bLPCVGigTrw,218266,221033,I got a good phrase for you to take home: “That's no sign you got it”.
bLPCVGigTrw,222666,225766,"Just because you've listened to those millionaire tapes one time, no sign you've got it."
bLPCVGigTrw,225766,229333,I'm asking you to listen to them over and over and over.
bLPCVGigTrw,229333,232965,I'm asking you to dedicate yourself to a new level of learning.

bLPCVGigTrw,248233,252600,"major determining factor in how your life works out. Each person's philosophy,"

bLPCVGigTrw,255166,257133,The same wind blows on us all.
bLPCVGigTrw,257833,260299,"The difference in where we arrive at the end of the week, at the end of the month,"
bLPCVGigTrw,260299,262500,at the end of the year is not the wind that blows.
bLPCVGigTrw,263266,264766,But what's gonna make the major difference?
bLPCVGigTrw,264766,268699,"Each person's personal philosophy that sets a better sail, sets a better sail."
bLPCVGigTrw,269266,271766,So don't ask for a more favorable wind.
bLPCVGigTrw,271766,274266,That's like wishing something that's not gonna occur.
bLPCVGigTrw,274733,278233,Don't ask for better seed and soil. All you got's what's available.
bLPCVGigTrw,278600,279900,Don't curse what you got.
bLPCVGigTrw,280833,285766,The key is to set a better sail and turn what you've got into the miracle of your future.

bLPCVGigTrw,298866,301432,"Taking notes, rolling up your sleeves, going to work."
bLPCVGigTrw,301433,305933,"Commit yourself to learning, so that you can get smarter for the days ahead."
bLPCVGigTrw,306333,308300,Life is worthwhile if you learn.
bLPCVGigTrw,309633,311866,You gotta know. You gotta have the information.
bLPCVGigTrw,312066,315566,"When I talk to the kids in school, that's what I say. Get the information while you're here."
bLPCVGigTrw,315700,317500,"What you're gonna do with it, that's up to you."
bLPCVGigTrw,317700,322933,"Throw it all away, that's up to you. Just use a little of it, that's up to you. But while you're here, get it all."
bLPCVGigTrw,323500,328900,"So, jot this down now, as I used in my notes: “What you don't know will hurt you”."
bLPCVGigTrw,329366,331900,Ignorance is not bliss.
bLPCVGigTrw,332866,334633,Ignorance is tragedy.
bLPCVGigTrw,334633,336432,Ignorance is illness.
bLPCVGigTrw,336433,338100,Ignorance is devastation.
bLPCVGigTrw,338100,339933,Ignorance is going broke.
bLPCVGigTrw,340833,343766,Ignorances creates a poor life.
bLPCVGigTrw,345066,347500,"So you gotta know, you gotta have the information."
bLPCVGigTrw,348933,351100,"Number one, learn from your personal experience."
bLPCVGigTrw,352466,355800,"One way to learn to do it right is first, mess it up and do it wrong."
bLPCVGigTrw,355800,357866,That doesn't mean it's the end of your life.
bLPCVGigTrw,358366,361500,"But just, you know, clean up the mess, now, do it right."
bLPCVGigTrw,363700,369333,"From a negative experience, sometimes we learn to do the positive things that saves our life and makes us successful."
bLPCVGigTrw,369866,380266,"They say, if you survive your first heart attack, if you survive, you may now live to be a very old person."
bLPCVGigTrw,381433,385066,Why is that? That first heart attack was a wake up call.
bLPCVGigTrw,385466,392366,"And then maybe the doctor said, another one of these and you're history and you say, Wow!"
bLPCVGigTrw,392800,395233,And you make it for the health food store.
bLPCVGigTrw,395800,398733,And you start reading every book you could read on health and nutrition.
bLPCVGigTrw,398733,402433,And you start doing the pushups and you start jogging on the beach and doing all the stuff.
bLPCVGigTrw,402433,407766,"And all of that change now could very well help you to live a long, long life."
bLPCVGigTrw,407966,412200,Having been alerted in an alarm system that serves you well.
bLPCVGigTrw,412966,416966,So learn from your negative as well as your positive experiences.
bLPCVGigTrw,417133,423033,"Here's the next, learn from other people's experiences. That's how you get smarter in a shorter period of time."
bLPCVGigTrw,423333,426266,Somebody that's been through it for five years and they wrote a book.
bLPCVGigTrw,427233,430133,"And the book, if you read it, could save you five years."
bLPCVGigTrw,430900,434166,Cost? Thirty dollars.
bLPCVGigTrw,436233,439433,"See you just, you can't miss that kind of education."
bLPCVGigTrw,441700,444733,"Best to get the information before. Yes, we can recover."
bLPCVGigTrw,444733,448300,"Yes, we can come back from bankruptcy and disaster and poor health."
bLPCVGigTrw,448566,454433,"But wow, if we had the information up front, that would save us some of those years of disaster."
bLPCVGigTrw,454900,460866,"How much better that would be? So learn from other people's experiences, both negative and positive."
bLPCVGigTrw,464766,469533,"Develop the ability to absorb, the ability to get everything."
bLPCVGigTrw,469900,472166,I don't know what all you've planned here but
bLPCVGigTrw,472166,477199,"you know, be in every class, you possibly can. Just stay as long as you can."
bLPCVGigTrw,477200,480566,"The key is not to be careless in the gathering of knowledge,"
bLPCVGigTrw,480566,484633,"not to be casual in the ideas that could double your health,"
bLPCVGigTrw,484633,492932,"triple your income, accelerate your career, secure your fortune, amplify your harvest."
bLPCVGigTrw,493266,498300,"So, don't be careless in the gathering of ideas. Absorb every one you possibly can."
bLPCVGigTrw,499300,502733,"The whole world is governed by laws, the universe, in fact."
bLPCVGigTrw,503200,507333,Laws. We call it the law of electricity. We call it the law of gravity.
bLPCVGigTrw,507800,515766,"There's mathematical laws, there's physical laws, speed and velocity laws, agricultural laws. There's all kinds of laws."
bLPCVGigTrw,516700,522033,"Now that we find ourselves on the spinning planet, you just have to learn what I call the “Setup”."
bLPCVGigTrw,523133,528200,"Learn the setup, life's setup."
bLPCVGigTrw,530733,534733,"Now we didn't set it up, but we're here, so you got to learn it."
bLPCVGigTrw,535600,540466,"And we should learn this setup for two basic reasons. Number one, to keep from getting hurt."
bLPCVGigTrw,541000,543633,"It's one of the major reasons for learning, so you won't get hurt."
bLPCVGigTrw,545500,548700,"See economically, socially, personally, you can get hurt just not knowing."
bLPCVGigTrw,550400,552933,Ignorance is not bliss.
bLPCVGigTrw,553900,559233,"Ignorance is poverty, ignorance is tragedy. You gotta know or you're gonna get hurt."
bLPCVGigTrw,561733,565532,It's good to know not to walk out the ten storey window. That's excellent information.
bLPCVGigTrw,566933,570165,Now what if a guy didn’t know and he walks out? Now he's dead at the bottom.
bLPCVGigTrw,570166,571966,"Somebody says, “Well, the poor guy didn't know”."
bLPCVGigTrw,573700,577033,"You gotta know, or you're gonna get hurt."
bLPCVGigTrw,578933,581233,"Okay, now here's a parenthesis."
bLPCVGigTrw,582333,584133,You don't have to like the setup.
bLPCVGigTrw,585766,587966,I don't ask you to like how it is.
bLPCVGigTrw,589300,593532,"That's not what's important, but it is important to learn how it is."
bLPCVGigTrw,595266,598500,"Okay, so you don't have to like it, but you should learn it."
bLPCVGigTrw,599766,603566,"That's what I tell the kids, right? Make sure you get the information."
bLPCVGigTrw,605600,609399,"What you think about it, that's up to you. What you're gonna do with it, that will soon be up to you."
bLPCVGigTrw,609500,611300,But make sure you get it.
bLPCVGigTrw,612766,616733,"See, there's nothing worse than being stupid, nothing."
bLPCVGigTrw,618166,622366,"I mean, being broke is bad, but being stupid is awful."
bLPCVGigTrw,624300,627365,"And what's really bad is being broke and stupid, right?"
bLPCVGigTrw,628300,633133,"That's about the end of the world. I mean, there isn't anything much worse than that, unless you're sick."
bLPCVGigTrw,634133,639133,"Sick, broke and stupid. I mean, that is it. Right? There's nowhere else to go."
bLPCVGigTrw,641200,644866,"So, make sure you get the information, it's key."
bLPCVGigTrw,645400,647933,"You don't have to like it, but learn it."
bLPCVGigTrw,649066,651300,It's called your basic smart.
bLPCVGigTrw,652866,657566,"So number one, learn so you won't get hurt, whether you like it or not. Learn."
bLPCVGigTrw,658066,661966,"Now, here's the second reason for learning the setup: “To benefit”."
bLPCVGigTrw,663300,668966,"It's called the plus of life, and that's what life is, right, both minus and plus."
bLPCVGigTrw,669666,675133,"The minus is tragedy, heartache, misery, failure, unhappiness."
bLPCVGigTrw,676133,679433,"But life is also happiness, prosperity, good feelings."
bLPCVGigTrw,679900,685166,"So, here's the key: Learn to get on the good side of the way things work."
bLPCVGigTrw,686800,692032,"Now, in transforming our lives, we don't start with attitude, we don't start with the inspiration here."
bLPCVGigTrw,692400,693833,We start with education.
bLPCVGigTrw,694800,700399,"Somebody says, “Well, I expected you just come get motivated today”. Well, that probably won't do it."
bLPCVGigTrw,701500,707533,"No, that's not where you start. Life change does not start with inspiration, life change starts with education."
bLPCVGigTrw,708766,712133,You gotta be educated to the point of where you might have messed up.
bLPCVGigTrw,713066,718000,"My teacher put it in blunt, simple language. He only went to the ninth grade in school, so,"
bLPCVGigTrw,718000,719866,"he put it in simple language, I could understand."
bLPCVGigTrw,720100,723300,"He said Mr Rohn, after six years living in America,"
bLPCVGigTrw,723300,727266,"healthy American male, twenty-five years old, been working six years, one year of college,"
bLPCVGigTrw,727266,731000,"pennies in your pocket, nothing in the bank, behind on your promises."
bLPCVGigTrw,731300,735066,"Shoaff said, I just got one simple explanation for that: You've messed up."
bLPCVGigTrw,736366,738400,"Now, I could understand that kind of language."
bLPCVGigTrw,739833,744800,"Should walk around the block, could walk around the block, won't walk around the block."
bLPCVGigTrw,744800,749666,You have messed up and all you got to go is write down through the list.
bLPCVGigTrw,750000,754533,"Don't need some teacher to come by and tell you. Be your own best teacher saying, “Hey,"
bLPCVGigTrw,754533,756833,let me make a list of some places I've messed up”.
bLPCVGigTrw,757100,762165,"Because if I let this down, let this down, that probably affects the rest? And the answer is that's true."
bLPCVGigTrw,763333,765800,"So, we don't start with inspiration, we start with education."
bLPCVGigTrw,765933,769032,"Someone says, “Well, just motivate this guy, he'll be all right. Just motivate him, get him turned on”."
bLPCVGigTrw,769200,770200,Probably not.
bLPCVGigTrw,771000,773866,"If a guy's an idiot, you motivate him, now you got a motivated idiot."
bLPCVGigTrw,776100,777133,"No, it won't be alright."
bLPCVGigTrw,781900,784333,So we start with education. What's the first education?
bLPCVGigTrw,784666,792066,"If it isn't going well and you live in America, you have messed up. You don't need to change countries."
bLPCVGigTrw,793900,797066,"You say, “Well, the country's messed up”. That's like cursing the soil"
bLPCVGigTrw,797066,801966,"and cursing the seed and the sunshine and the rain, which is all you got. Don't curse all you got."
bLPCVGigTrw,803566,806466,"When you get your own planet, you can rearrange this whole deal, but"
bLPCVGigTrw,808100,810000,"this one, you got to take like it comes."
bLPCVGigTrw,810833,813033,"He said, “How many books have you read in the last ninety days”?"
bLPCVGigTrw,814733,815399,"I said, What?"
bLPCVGigTrw,817500,822666,"Zero. Wisdom of the world available. Change your life, change your future."
bLPCVGigTrw,822666,827100,"Wisdom of the world available. Develop any skill you want, earn the kind of income you want."
bLPCVGigTrw,827100,830500,"Have all the treasures you want, equities you want. Relationship with your family that you want."
bLPCVGigTrw,830500,834000,Everything that you want available and the wisdom of the world to help you get it.
bLPCVGigTrw,834266,838700,"Haven't read any books in the last ninety days. My teacher said, “Mr. Rohn,"
bLPCVGigTrw,838700,843133,"you have messed up”. I'm telling you, you've got to deal."
bLPCVGigTrw,844433,847933,"Shoaff said, “Mr Rohn, in the last six months, how many classes have you taken"
bLPCVGigTrw,848466,852333,to improve your skills or to develop new skills?”
bLPCVGigTrw,853000,858066,"Go for the American dream, become rich and powerful and sophisticated and healthy and influential."
bLPCVGigTrw,859000,862500,"How many classes have you taken in the last six months? I said, How many?"
bLPCVGigTrw,863266,869566,"Zero. He said, “You have messed up”. He said, “You don't need to unmess the country."
bLPCVGigTrw,869566,873199,You don't need to straighten out the perplexed. You don't need to straighten out any of this stuff.
bLPCVGigTrw,873200,877433,All you got to do is look within and let results teach you
bLPCVGigTrw,877433,884233,"a great deal about your own activity, your own attitude and your own philosophy”."
bLPCVGigTrw,885533,886866,I went through that process.
bLPCVGigTrw,887866,891466,Take this phrase home: Results is the name of the game.
bLPCVGigTrw,891933,893300,What other game is there?
bLPCVGigTrw,898833,901633,Part of this personal development challenge is to develop mentally.
bLPCVGigTrw,902733,907165,"Learn, study, grow, change. It's what schooling is all about."
bLPCVGigTrw,908100,912899,"And the human development takes time, incredible amounts of time."
bLPCVGigTrw,914300,920000,It's why we've taken the time for this seminar. It just takes time. Some things you can't cover in a 20 minute speech.
bLPCVGigTrw,920700,924300,"You can't cover in a little five minute talk, it takes time."
bLPCVGigTrw,925333,929533,"For humans, it takes, seem like more time than any other life form, human beings."
bLPCVGigTrw,930933,934066,"The little wilderbeast in Africa,"
bLPCVGigTrw,934066,937165,guess how much time it's got as soon as it's born to be able
bLPCVGigTrw,937166,940166,to run with the pack so it doesn't get eaten by the lions?
bLPCVGigTrw,941466,944400,Guess how much time it's got? A few minutes.
bLPCVGigTrw,945533,950633,"Not hours, not days. Minutes."
bLPCVGigTrw,951533,955566,Wow. But the human baby. Wow.
bLPCVGigTrw,956366,964033,"After sixteen years, we're not sure. Unbelievable amount of time it takes."
bLPCVGigTrw,967100,972566,"So, it does take time for personal development, does take time for spiritual development, physical development."
bLPCVGigTrw,973666,976533,"But here's also what takes time, and that's your mental development."
bLPCVGigTrw,976900,980800,Feeding the mind. Nourishing the mind.
bLPCVGigTrw,981800,984633,Some people read so little they got rickets of the mind.
bLPCVGigTrw,986600,990266,"They couldn't give you a good, strong argument as to their own personal beliefs."
bLPCVGigTrw,991933,994466,"I'm telling you, you gotta be able to pick up those ideologies."
bLPCVGigTrw,994466,996233,You gotta be able to pick up the philosophy.
bLPCVGigTrw,996233,998800,And here's the next part: You gotta be able to defend it.
bLPCVGigTrw,999033,1006300,"If you can't defend your virtues and if you can't defend your values, I'm telling you, even in the nineties,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1006300,1011100,you'll fall prey to philosophies that are not in your best interest.
bLPCVGigTrw,1011733,1014633,You gotta get yourself ready. And one of the ways you gotta get ready
bLPCVGigTrw,1014633,1019133,"is not just physical and not just spiritual, you gotta get ready mentally."
bLPCVGigTrw,1020500,1023933,"And this is where Shoaff went to work on me, to be ready mentally,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1025233,1029400,to develop the philosophy and also be able to defend your virtues and your values.
bLPCVGigTrw,1030833,1032733,"Don't be a follower, be a student."
bLPCVGigTrw,1034865,1039065,You'd be happy to know today we haven't come seeking disciples.
bLPCVGigTrw,1039066,1041300,We've got no movement for you to join.
bLPCVGigTrw,1042133,1046133,"I'm just here to share some of my experiences, good ideas, best I can."
bLPCVGigTrw,1047133,1051200,"But I think that's good advice: “Don't be a follower, be a student”. Right?"
bLPCVGigTrw,1051500,1053266,"Take advice, but not orders."
bLPCVGigTrw,1054533,1058033,"Take information but don't let somebody, you know, order your life."
bLPCVGigTrw,1058033,1060866,Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion.
bLPCVGigTrw,1061133,1066933,Excellent note to make: Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion.
bLPCVGigTrw,1067833,1069466,Not to do what someone else says.
bLPCVGigTrw,1070966,1074600,"Take what someone else says, process it, think about it, ponder it."
bLPCVGigTrw,1075466,1078600,"If it makes you wonder, if it makes you think, then it's valuable."
bLPCVGigTrw,1079166,1083166,"Then when you go take action, make sure that the action is not what somebody told you to do."
bLPCVGigTrw,1083166,1085966,Make sure the action is the product of your own conclusion.
bLPCVGigTrw,1087066,1091600,"If you'll follow just a little bit of those simple guidelines,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1091600,1095600,"I'm telling you the learning process can be speedy, swift, powerful."
bLPCVGigTrw,1095900,1099300,"Your learning curve can go up and then applying it to your business, your life,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1099300,1102500,"your family, conversations, equities of all kinds."
bLPCVGigTrw,1102500,1105800,You'll find some progress like I did that first five years
bLPCVGigTrw,1105800,1108200,when I met a teacher willing to share with me.
bLPCVGigTrw,1108200,1112600,"Turned my life around, progress I couldn't believe happened for me."
bLPCVGigTrw,1114200,1116266,Develop the ability to reflect.
bLPCVGigTrw,1117266,1119100,"Part of this, is in the challenge when you go home,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1119100,1123466,"not to just put these notes away, but to get them out, maybe"
bLPCVGigTrw,1123466,1127065,"fairly often over the next thirty days, sixty days, ninety days,"
bLPCVGigTrw,1127066,1132733,"just to review the notes, to drive the ideas a little deeper, to come up with a little more refinement."
bLPCVGigTrw,1133466,1137700,"And if you go back over these notes, I promise you, there is something you will discover"
bLPCVGigTrw,1137700,1141132,that you just didn't have the time to discover while you were taking the notes.
bLPCVGigTrw,1141633,1145600,That's why review is so important. Go back over it again. Go back over it again.
bLPCVGigTrw,1145866,1148166,Here's what I call it: Run the tapes again.
bLPCVGigTrw,1148766,1151400,The tape in your mind and the tape from your notes.
bLPCVGigTrw,1151966,1154933,And see if you can capture something you might have missed.
bLPCVGigTrw,1155566,1159766,"Or to develop an extension of something you got, now that by going back over it, now you can see."
bLPCVGigTrw,1159766,1162666,Now I see. Here's what I could do with that
bLPCVGigTrw,1162666,1165866,"that might multiply the value of my life by two, by three, by five."
bLPCVGigTrw,1168366,1170600,"Here's a good time to reflect, when the day is over."
bLPCVGigTrw,1171366,1173966,How did it go and who did you see and what did you say?
bLPCVGigTrw,1174333,1178366,What mistakes did you make and what did you leave out that you could correct tomorrow?
bLPCVGigTrw,1181533,1183232,Reflect at the end of the month.
bLPCVGigTrw,1183933,1189132,"Thirty days, that's when you usually do the accounting for your business and the company and the corporation."
bLPCVGigTrw,1189300,1193866,"Do the accounting for your health. If you needed to lose weight, how many pounds have you lost?"
bLPCVGigTrw,1194333,1196700,Just do a good reflective accounting.
bLPCVGigTrw,1198400,1201933,How did it go? Where did you stumble? What did you miss?
bLPCVGigTrw,1201933,1204866,What should you have thought of that you let pass?
bLPCVGigTrw,1206200,1211399,Who didn't you see? Just review the last six days.
bLPCVGigTrw,1211400,1215100,What went right? What went wrong? What's there? What's missing?
bLPCVGigTrw,1216400,1219400,"Then here's what you do: Now, plan the next six days."
bLPCVGigTrw,1219766,1223600,"With this information of the last six, plan the next six."
bLPCVGigTrw,1225033,1228666,You will be absolutely surprised
bLPCVGigTrw,1228666,1233366,"at the value and the productivity of your weeks, if you'll start doing a little more of that."
