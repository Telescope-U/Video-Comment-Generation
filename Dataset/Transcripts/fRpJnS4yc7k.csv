fRpJnS4yc7k,160,2399,all right so uh that covers game theory
fRpJnS4yc7k,2399,4240,for the next couple weeks unless uh
fRpJnS4yc7k,4240,6240,anything last minute pops up moving on
fRpJnS4yc7k,6240,7680,uh food theory let's see we've got
fRpJnS4yc7k,7680,9440,crystal pepsi in the works we've got
fRpJnS4yc7k,9440,11679,radioactive bananas what are we going on
fRpJnS4yc7k,11679,12799,for next week
fRpJnS4yc7k,12799,15519,open week any pitches people on tick

fRpJnS4yc7k,21359,22960,miserable i like that i want to cover
fRpJnS4yc7k,22960,24400,that but let's not do it next week just
fRpJnS4yc7k,24400,25760,because that's a kitchen shoot we've
fRpJnS4yc7k,25760,27039,done a lot of kitchen stuff lately
fRpJnS4yc7k,27039,28080,anything else
fRpJnS4yc7k,28080,29199,anyone
fRpJnS4yc7k,29199,31119,oh uh
fRpJnS4yc7k,31119,33040,dan haven't you and your wife been
fRpJnS4yc7k,33040,35040,arguing about something so we've been
fRpJnS4yc7k,35040,37840,having an argument about whether or not
fRpJnS4yc7k,37840,40879,coffee is super not she says it is soup
fRpJnS4yc7k,40879,43760,i say you don't drink soup okay first
fRpJnS4yc7k,43760,46480,off you do drink soup like you can ladle
fRpJnS4yc7k,46480,48960,soup it's just broth right
fRpJnS4yc7k,48960,51199,soup you drink coffee campbell's made a
fRpJnS4yc7k,51199,53199,whole thing about like drinking soup
fRpJnS4yc7k,53199,54640,what type of soup are you saying it's a
fRpJnS4yc7k,54640,59079,bean soup no no no
fRpJnS4yc7k,60480,63199,it's not like chicken it's not like beef
fRpJnS4yc7k,63199,64000,okay
fRpJnS4yc7k,64000,65760,i think we got our episode amy's
fRpJnS4yc7k,65760,67840,chugging her bean broth right now
fRpJnS4yc7k,67840,71560,don't say that
fRpJnS4yc7k,75050,82880,[Music]
fRpJnS4yc7k,82880,86080,hello internet welcome to food theory
fRpJnS4yc7k,86080,88479,the show that gets asked all the time
fRpJnS4yc7k,88479,90400,how we come up with episode topics and
fRpJnS4yc7k,90400,92320,well you just saw it that meeting at the
fRpJnS4yc7k,92320,93920,top of the episode was exactly what gave
fRpJnS4yc7k,93920,95680,rise to the video that you're watching
fRpJnS4yc7k,95680,97680,right now our head editor dan was having
fRpJnS4yc7k,97680,99439,a nerdy debate with his wife and so we
fRpJnS4yc7k,99439,101200,decided to stick our noses into his
fRpJnS4yc7k,101200,103200,business and settle it once and for all
fRpJnS4yc7k,103200,104479,because that's what you do when you make
fRpJnS4yc7k,104479,106240,online content you monetize your
fRpJnS4yc7k,106240,107840,personal life you see back when this
fRpJnS4yc7k,107840,109280,channel first launched we covered what
fRpJnS4yc7k,109280,111280,makes a sandwich a sandwich that simple
fRpJnS4yc7k,111280,113119,question sent us on a wild goose chase
fRpJnS4yc7k,113119,115040,through court rulings international tax
fRpJnS4yc7k,115040,116960,law and legal loopholes to ultimately
fRpJnS4yc7k,116960,118640,find that the definition of a sandwich
fRpJnS4yc7k,118640,121439,in some areas includes burritos pizza
fRpJnS4yc7k,121439,123520,even chicken wings yup you heard that
fRpJnS4yc7k,123520,125680,right chicken wings which could never be
fRpJnS4yc7k,125680,127759,considered a sandwich by any reasonable
fRpJnS4yc7k,127759,130800,person ever yet there was defined as a
fRpJnS4yc7k,130800,133280,sandwich by certain colorado tax laws
fRpJnS4yc7k,133280,135280,but you see those are the absurdly high
fRpJnS4yc7k,135280,136560,stakes that we're dealing with in
fRpJnS4yc7k,136560,138480,episodes like this for as dumb and
fRpJnS4yc7k,138480,140640,random as questions like is coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,140640,142800,actually bean soup might seem decisions
fRpJnS4yc7k,142800,144879,around these definitions actually impact
fRpJnS4yc7k,144879,146720,your pocketbook as well as the bottom
fRpJnS4yc7k,146720,148400,lines for both restaurants and the
fRpJnS4yc7k,148400,150000,government as an example of how the
fRpJnS4yc7k,150000,151680,legal definition of coffee can lead to
fRpJnS4yc7k,151680,154000,high-stakes legal battles in 2014 a pair
fRpJnS4yc7k,154000,155519,of people sued target because they had
fRpJnS4yc7k,155519,157440,been charged sales tax for their to-go
fRpJnS4yc7k,157440,159360,order of coffee why would they have a
fRpJnS4yc7k,159360,161200,problem with that well california has a
fRpJnS4yc7k,161200,163280,sales tax exemption for certain products
fRpJnS4yc7k,163280,165360,which include quote coffee and coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,165360,167519,substitutes tea and cocoa and cocoa
fRpJnS4yc7k,167519,169120,products and yet here was target
fRpJnS4yc7k,169120,170959,charging them the sales tax seems like
fRpJnS4yc7k,170959,172879,target was clearly in the wrong here
fRpJnS4yc7k,172879,174640,right well then you get to the tricky
fRpJnS4yc7k,174640,176400,part under california tax law you're
fRpJnS4yc7k,176400,178239,charged different tax rates depending on
fRpJnS4yc7k,178239,180319,whether you're getting hot or cold food
fRpJnS4yc7k,180319,182080,if you're just getting cold food say a
fRpJnS4yc7k,182080,184319,sandwich to go you pay a lower tax rate
fRpJnS4yc7k,184319,186239,if you're getting something hot like say
fRpJnS4yc7k,186239,188319,a hot bowl of soup then you pay a higher
fRpJnS4yc7k,188319,190319,tax rate but if that wasn't weird enough
fRpJnS4yc7k,190319,192239,it gets even stranger if you're getting
fRpJnS4yc7k,192239,193920,multiple food items suddenly that
fRpJnS4yc7k,193920,196239,becomes a meal and if there's any hot
fRpJnS4yc7k,196239,198239,food product in there whatsoever then
fRpJnS4yc7k,198239,201360,the entire thing is taxed as a hot meal
fRpJnS4yc7k,201360,203360,so what does any of this have to do with
fRpJnS4yc7k,203360,205519,coffee well that california tax code
fRpJnS4yc7k,205519,208080,lists coffee as an example of a hot food
fRpJnS4yc7k,208080,210000,product by its inclusion in a meal it
fRpJnS4yc7k,210000,212080,transforms the entire thing into a hot
fRpJnS4yc7k,212080,213920,meal and gets it taxed higher cold
fRpJnS4yc7k,213920,216480,sandwich tax exempt hot coffee tax
fRpJnS4yc7k,216480,218959,exempt cold sandwich plus hot coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,218959,220319,suddenly you've gotten yourself a hot
fRpJnS4yc7k,220319,222080,meal and both parts are getting taxed at
fRpJnS4yc7k,222080,223760,the higher rates like when you multiply
fRpJnS4yc7k,223760,225519,two negative numbers to get a positive
fRpJnS4yc7k,225519,227760,eat two tax-exempt food items together
fRpJnS4yc7k,227760,229760,and you get to spend more on taxes in
fRpJnS4yc7k,229760,231840,the end target won the case as the court
fRpJnS4yc7k,231840,233280,said in its opinion on the verdict the
fRpJnS4yc7k,233280,235280,exemptions that may or may not apply to
fRpJnS4yc7k,235280,236879,different food products are quote
fRpJnS4yc7k,236879,239120,exceedingly closely regulated complex
fRpJnS4yc7k,239120,241200,and highly technical and as matpat said
fRpJnS4yc7k,241200,243360,in his opinion on the verdict is dumb
fRpJnS4yc7k,243360,245280,but can case law help us settle our head
fRpJnS4yc7k,245280,246879,editor dan's domestic debate well
fRpJnS4yc7k,246879,248480,looking deeper into the legalese around
fRpJnS4yc7k,248480,250000,the classification of soups and coffees
fRpJnS4yc7k,250000,251599,what immediately becomes clear is that
fRpJnS4yc7k,251599,253280,tax loss seems much more concerned with
fRpJnS4yc7k,253280,254959,how the coffee is served and how you
fRpJnS4yc7k,254959,256720,order it rather than what's actually in
fRpJnS4yc7k,256720,258560,it for example many states have sales
fRpJnS4yc7k,258560,260160,tax regulations that say if you go to
fRpJnS4yc7k,260160,261359,starbucks and pick up one of those
fRpJnS4yc7k,261359,262960,pre-made frappuccinos that come in a
fRpJnS4yc7k,262960,264800,glass bottle you don't have to pay sales
fRpJnS4yc7k,264800,266400,tax whereas if you went to the barista
fRpJnS4yc7k,266400,267919,and asked them to make you a frappuccino
fRpJnS4yc7k,267919,269680,made with the exact same ingredients and
fRpJnS4yc7k,269680,271520,had it served in a plastic cup then you
fRpJnS4yc7k,271520,273520,would be paying sales tax and then you
fRpJnS4yc7k,273520,275360,have pennsylvania where brewed coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,275360,276639,that comes out of a vending machine
fRpJnS4yc7k,276639,278960,normally gets taxed but it's not taxed
fRpJnS4yc7k,278960,280320,if it comes out of the vending machine
fRpJnS4yc7k,280320,282400,in a cold bottle so it seems today we
fRpJnS4yc7k,282400,284400,need to be focused more on the culinary
fRpJnS4yc7k,284400,286240,definitions of these food preparations
fRpJnS4yc7k,286240,288479,rather than the legal ones so from a
fRpJnS4yc7k,288479,291199,culinary perspective is coffee bean soup
fRpJnS4yc7k,291199,293520,is it vegetable juice is it bean broth
fRpJnS4yc7k,293520,295520,is it something else entirely well if
fRpJnS4yc7k,295520,297120,you look all of these classifications
fRpJnS4yc7k,297120,298479,are made up of a first word that
fRpJnS4yc7k,298479,300320,describes the food type and a second
fRpJnS4yc7k,300320,302479,word that describes the liquid form so
fRpJnS4yc7k,302479,304240,to get our answer let's tackle one of
fRpJnS4yc7k,304240,306160,these at a time right out of the gate
fRpJnS4yc7k,306160,307919,though it's time to tell our head editor
fRpJnS4yc7k,307919,310000,dan the words that he's always wanted to
fRpJnS4yc7k,310000,311919,hear hey dan dan can you uh come into
fRpJnS4yc7k,311919,314080,the booth uh yeah hey what's up you got
fRpJnS4yc7k,314080,316479,a good news for me dan you're right your
fRpJnS4yc7k,316479,319360,wife is wrong coffee is definitely not
fRpJnS4yc7k,319360,321520,bean soup that's what i'm talking about
fRpJnS4yc7k,321520,323280,booyah but it's not for the reason you
fRpJnS4yc7k,323280,324880,think not because of the soup part but
fRpJnS4yc7k,324880,326639,because of the bean part see coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,326639,328639,beans aren't actually beans just like
fRpJnS4yc7k,328639,330479,peanuts aren't actually nuts and koala
fRpJnS4yc7k,330479,332479,bears aren't actually bears okay a bit
fRpJnS4yc7k,332479,334240,of a technicality but i'll take the win
fRpJnS4yc7k,334240,336160,you see the word bean actually has a
fRpJnS4yc7k,336160,337840,very specific definition within the
fRpJnS4yc7k,337840,339600,flowering plant family of fubasi
fRpJnS4yc7k,339600,341600,otherwise known as the legume pea or
fRpJnS4yc7k,341600,343440,bean family there are several genuses
fRpJnS4yc7k,343440,345520,whose seeds are classified as beans if
fRpJnS4yc7k,345520,346880,you're not part of that specific group
fRpJnS4yc7k,346880,349120,then you are not technically a bean and
fRpJnS4yc7k,349120,351440,coffee is not part of the club so for
fRpJnS4yc7k,351440,353840,your wife to say it's a bean soup she is
fRpJnS4yc7k,353840,356319,technically wrong it may still wind up
fRpJnS4yc7k,356319,357759,being a soup we're gonna get to that in
fRpJnS4yc7k,357759,360080,a minute here but it's definitely not a
fRpJnS4yc7k,360080,362240,bean soup though might i suggest not
fRpJnS4yc7k,362240,363680,making a big deal of that tonight at
fRpJnS4yc7k,363680,365360,dinner dunking on your wife for being
fRpJnS4yc7k,365360,367600,wrong is rarely a good decision i
fRpJnS4yc7k,367600,369440,appreciate the advice i'm just not gonna
fRpJnS4yc7k,369440,371039,listen to it all right now back to the
fRpJnS4yc7k,371039,372720,editor dungeon please this narrative
fRpJnS4yc7k,372720,374319,conceit's getting a bit tiring to keep
fRpJnS4yc7k,374319,376080,up there's plenty of restocked coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,376080,377840,down there for you to inject as you see
fRpJnS4yc7k,377840,380479,fit i prefer the iv bags okay so if
fRpJnS4yc7k,380479,382560,coffee is a plant but it's not beans
fRpJnS4yc7k,382560,385360,then is it a vegetable well also no well
fRpJnS4yc7k,385360,387120,an actual bean would be a legume and
fRpJnS4yc7k,387120,388720,therefore a vegetable what we call the
fRpJnS4yc7k,388720,391039,coffee bean is actually a seed taken
fRpJnS4yc7k,391039,392960,from the fruit of a coffea plant the
fRpJnS4yc7k,392960,394479,fruits of these plants which are known
fRpJnS4yc7k,394479,396880,as cherries or berries contain one or
fRpJnS4yc7k,396880,399199,two seeds seeds that we then call coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,399199,400960,beans and just to make matters even more
fRpJnS4yc7k,400960,403199,confusing those coffee cherries not
fRpJnS4yc7k,403199,404800,actually a cherry for similar
fRpJnS4yc7k,404800,406639,taxonomical reasons let's just leave it
fRpJnS4yc7k,406639,408160,at coffee beans aren't beans they're the
fRpJnS4yc7k,408160,410479,seeds of the coffee fruit so that's the
fRpJnS4yc7k,410479,412240,first half of what coffee actually is
fRpJnS4yc7k,412240,413520,but what about the second half of our
fRpJnS4yc7k,413520,415759,classification if coffee is a liquid
fRpJnS4yc7k,415759,417680,made from fruit seeds does that then
fRpJnS4yc7k,417680,419680,make it a fruit juice i mean that's what
fRpJnS4yc7k,419680,421599,pomegranate juice is after all pop those
fRpJnS4yc7k,421599,423360,seeds like nature's own bubble wrap and
fRpJnS4yc7k,423360,425520,drink the results well no and it all
fRpJnS4yc7k,425520,427759,comes down to the word juice juice is
fRpJnS4yc7k,427759,429120,technically the drink that's made from
fRpJnS4yc7k,429120,430560,the natural liquids contained within a
fRpJnS4yc7k,430560,432400,fruit or a vegetable a liquid that is
fRpJnS4yc7k,432400,434639,then extracted by squeezing or pressing
fRpJnS4yc7k,434639,436000,squeeze an orange and drink what comes
fRpJnS4yc7k,436000,437520,out same thing with pomegranate juice
fRpJnS4yc7k,437520,438639,drink the liquid that's coming out of
fRpJnS4yc7k,438639,440639,the seeds if a product is labeled and
fRpJnS4yc7k,440639,442800,sold as juice it is legally required for
fRpJnS4yc7k,442800,444479,the liquid portion to come from a fruit
fRpJnS4yc7k,444479,445919,this also means that fruit flavored
fRpJnS4yc7k,445919,447520,drinks that you make by mixing a powder
fRpJnS4yc7k,447520,449520,with water like kool-aid tang or crystal
fRpJnS4yc7k,449520,451440,light are not juices and you'll notice
fRpJnS4yc7k,451440,453199,that they don't advertise themselves
fRpJnS4yc7k,453199,454880,that way they're not allowed to if you
fRpJnS4yc7k,454880,456160,read the packaging for products like
fRpJnS4yc7k,456160,457440,this you'll tend to see stuff like you
fRpJnS4yc7k,457440,459039,see on the crystal light label here a
fRpJnS4yc7k,459039,461520,sweet alternative to juice so cross
fRpJnS4yc7k,461520,463360,fruit juice off the list that said if
fRpJnS4yc7k,463360,465680,you do want to try actual coffee juice
fRpJnS4yc7k,465680,466879,it's a thing you can actually make in
fRpJnS4yc7k,466879,468240,fact that's exactly what a company
fRpJnS4yc7k,468240,470319,called kona red did rather than throwing
fRpJnS4yc7k,470319,471840,the outer part of the coffee of fruit
fRpJnS4yc7k,471840,473599,away after removing the seeds they took
fRpJnS4yc7k,473599,475360,the fruit and squeezed the juice out of
fRpJnS4yc7k,475360,477120,them to create a bottled drink that you
fRpJnS4yc7k,477120,478800,can no longer buy because they've gone
fRpJnS4yc7k,478800,480240,out of business apparently there's a
fRpJnS4yc7k,480240,481520,good reason that part of the plant
fRpJnS4yc7k,481520,482800,doesn't make it into the cup of joe that
fRpJnS4yc7k,482800,484479,you're sipping every morning so if it's
fRpJnS4yc7k,484479,486400,not a fruit juice then what does it make
fRpJnS4yc7k,486400,489599,it then a fruit broth soup puree gruel
fRpJnS4yc7k,489599,491919,porridge gravy well gravy is an easy one
fRpJnS4yc7k,491919,493680,to cross off the list for as delicious
fRpJnS4yc7k,493680,496400,as a slow pouring thick viscous coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,496400,498720,gravy might sound aka not at all
fRpJnS4yc7k,498720,500960,delicious gravies by definition are
fRpJnS4yc7k,500960,503520,thickened by adding flour or cornstarch
fRpJnS4yc7k,503520,505840,definitely not a fit porridge and gruel
fRpJnS4yc7k,505840,507440,can also be safely crossed off the list
fRpJnS4yc7k,507440,509039,for similar reasons those are foods that
fRpJnS4yc7k,509039,511039,are made from starchy cereal grains
fRpJnS4yc7k,511039,512479,don't believe everything you see on tic
fRpJnS4yc7k,512479,514880,tac friends i'm trying
fRpJnS4yc7k,514880,517120,the coconut water berry
fRpJnS4yc7k,517120,520479,breakfast cereal
fRpJnS4yc7k,520479,521599,oh
fRpJnS4yc7k,521599,524480,it's good sorry lizzo that is not cereal
fRpJnS4yc7k,524480,526560,that is a bowl of fruit also why did you
fRpJnS4yc7k,526560,529040,put random ice cubes in i just i just
fRpJnS4yc7k,529040,531040,can't anyway cereals are specifically
fRpJnS4yc7k,531040,532720,grasses that are cultivated for their
fRpJnS4yc7k,532720,534959,edible grain components like wheat rice
fRpJnS4yc7k,534959,537360,and barley again not relevant to coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,537360,539920,puree is actually promising a puree by
fRpJnS4yc7k,539920,541760,definition is made by taking a fruit or
fRpJnS4yc7k,541760,543760,vegetable and pressing blending seething
fRpJnS4yc7k,543760,545600,or grinding it sounds like the same set
fRpJnS4yc7k,545600,547200,of words you'd use to describe making
fRpJnS4yc7k,547200,549279,coffee however what knocks puree out of
fRpJnS4yc7k,549279,551120,contention is that the point of grinding
fRpJnS4yc7k,551120,552640,pressing blending and sieving is that
fRpJnS4yc7k,552640,554880,the food can eventually be consumed you
fRpJnS4yc7k,554880,557040,eat a squash puree not just the liquid
fRpJnS4yc7k,557040,558560,that was run through it but no matter
fRpJnS4yc7k,558560,560240,how much you grind those coffee beans
fRpJnS4yc7k,560240,562240,you are not going to be eating those
fRpJnS4yc7k,562240,564080,grounds the reason that we grind them up
fRpJnS4yc7k,564080,565920,is to maximize the surface area so that
fRpJnS4yc7k,565920,567519,the flavor can leach out into the hot
fRpJnS4yc7k,567519,569120,water that's poured through it if you
fRpJnS4yc7k,569120,570800,mixed the coffee grounds into your final
fRpJnS4yc7k,570800,572480,beverage then sure that could be
fRpJnS4yc7k,572480,574560,considered a puree but if you drink your
fRpJnS4yc7k,574560,576880,coffee like a normal rational person
fRpJnS4yc7k,576880,578720,then nope not gonna cut it which brings
fRpJnS4yc7k,578720,581360,us down to broth or soup let's tackle
fRpJnS4yc7k,581360,583519,broth first this one seems like it might
fRpJnS4yc7k,583519,585760,apply a broth or bouillon is made by
fRpJnS4yc7k,585760,587279,simmering water together with a mixture
fRpJnS4yc7k,587279,589360,of other ingredients and while yes most
fRpJnS4yc7k,589360,591279,coffee is made using boiling water some
fRpJnS4yc7k,591279,593040,preparations involve simmering for
fRpJnS4yc7k,593040,594720,instance if you use a percolator the
fRpJnS4yc7k,594720,596240,water technically should never reach a
fRpJnS4yc7k,596240,598160,boil but even if we were just simmering
fRpJnS4yc7k,598160,599519,our coffee beans we'd have to contend
fRpJnS4yc7k,599519,600880,with the fact that broths tend to
fRpJnS4yc7k,600880,602399,describe the products of a simmering
fRpJnS4yc7k,602399,604800,meat fish or vegetable which our coffee
fRpJnS4yc7k,604800,607200,bean as we've established is none of and
fRpJnS4yc7k,607200,609760,with that we're here the final option is
fRpJnS4yc7k,609760,614720,coffee a soup the answer is yes no
fRpJnS4yc7k,614720,616560,yes
fRpJnS4yc7k,616560,618800,sorry dan but soup is commonly made by
fRpJnS4yc7k,618800,620560,boiling the ingredients to extract their
fRpJnS4yc7k,620560,622399,flavor and boiled water is the most
fRpJnS4yc7k,622399,624560,common way to make coffee but that's not
fRpJnS4yc7k,624560,625920,all one of the classic methods of
fRpJnS4yc7k,625920,627360,flavoring soup involves adding
fRpJnS4yc7k,627360,628959,ingredients to the boiled water that
fRpJnS4yc7k,628959,630399,aren't part of the finished product that
fRpJnS4yc7k,630399,632079,you eat it's common for soups to be made
fRpJnS4yc7k,632079,633360,with ingredients that are added for
fRpJnS4yc7k,633360,635600,flavor and then removed before serving
fRpJnS4yc7k,635600,638000,ingredients like bones or spices like
fRpJnS4yc7k,638000,640079,bay leaves and rosemary exactly what we
fRpJnS4yc7k,640079,642160,do with the coffee grounds but is there
fRpJnS4yc7k,642160,644160,such a thing as a fruit seed soup

fRpJnS4yc7k,669040,670399,that keeps this from being a perfect
fRpJnS4yc7k,670399,671920,label is the fact that soup is
fRpJnS4yc7k,671920,674079,classically used to describe a food not
fRpJnS4yc7k,674079,675440,a beverage but hey with the amount of
fRpJnS4yc7k,675440,676959,sugar and syrup that some of us add to
