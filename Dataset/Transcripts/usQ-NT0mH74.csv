usQ-NT0mH74,379039,380960,today we're getting square
usQ-NT0mH74,380960,383440,this unusual card creation begins with a

usQ-NT0mH74,390800,392880,something called four corner bread the
usQ-NT0mH74,392880,394880,next man on this assembly line presses
usQ-NT0mH74,394880,396800,out a square shape that allows the dough
usQ-NT0mH74,396800,399039,to rest and rise for 30 minutes this is
usQ-NT0mH74,399039,401840,a nice break from that super rich oily

usQ-NT0mH74,403919,406400,bakery signature branding using a steel
usQ-NT0mH74,406400,408000,tool that looks like a comb at his
usQ-NT0mH74,408000,410319,fingertips he transforms the look of the
usQ-NT0mH74,410319,412000,dough in seconds pretty soon that's

usQ-NT0mH74,422400,423440,right here
usQ-NT0mH74,423440,425360,before putting it in the oven this boss
usQ-NT0mH74,425360,427199,level baker wets the dough with jaggedy
usQ-NT0mH74,427199,428880,water to prevent slipping before laying
usQ-NT0mH74,428880,430639,it upon the bread pillow you guys have a
usQ-NT0mH74,430639,432960,bread pillow at home i doubt it now the
usQ-NT0mH74,432960,435520,most impressive part this fiery tandoor
usQ-NT0mH74,435520,437599,oven is hundreds of degrees but that
usQ-NT0mH74,437599,439440,doesn't stop this man from sticking his
usQ-NT0mH74,439440,441520,bare arm inside
usQ-NT0mH74,441520,443039,what i always love and respect about
usQ-NT0mH74,443039,444720,people who work with the tandoor is the
usQ-NT0mH74,444720,446960,way they just slap the bread on there
usQ-NT0mH74,446960,448800,with such confidence because it is very
usQ-NT0mH74,448800,450960,hot in this oven he not only bakes but
usQ-NT0mH74,450960,454000,also monitors up to 50 non at one time
usQ-NT0mH74,454000,455360,the tandoor's temperature is
usQ-NT0mH74,455360,456880,scientifically controlled by the
usQ-NT0mH74,456880,459599,occasional sprinkling of h2o once the
usQ-NT0mH74,459599,461199,bread hits the right shade of golden

usQ-NT0mH74,994800,997600,in a guar mold this milky looking batter
usQ-NT0mH74,997600,999920,is made of all-purpose flour ghee and
usQ-NT0mH74,999920,1002079,water
usQ-NT0mH74,1002079,1003839,once it reaches the point of critical
usQ-NT0mH74,1003839,1006800,crispiness drain the oil
usQ-NT0mH74,1006800,1008959,now completely submerge it into sugary

usQ-NT0mH74,1011199,1013839,bindi to toe eating it like this would
usQ-NT0mH74,1013839,1015920,make me happy but it turns out this is
usQ-NT0mH74,1015920,1017690,just the foundation
usQ-NT0mH74,1017690,1018800,[Music]
usQ-NT0mH74,1018800,1020800,next the inside is coated with sweet

usQ-NT0mH74,1047760,1049360,people love saffron in india anything
usQ-NT0mH74,1049360,1051440,that suggests that it's luxurious or
usQ-NT0mH74,1051440,1053679,expensive saffron has a unique taste to
usQ-NT0mH74,1053679,1054880,it it's not usually a taste i would
usQ-NT0mH74,1054880,1056559,associate with desserts but here i kind
