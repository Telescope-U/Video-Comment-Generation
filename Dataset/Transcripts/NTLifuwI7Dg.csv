NTLifuwI7Dg,312400,318400,but the seasonings it is so delicious  it's sweet but it's spicy and savory all  at the same time it's not a load of meat
NTLifuwI7Dg,318400,323840,like a big leg from a king crab but it  carries its way i tell you what jamaica  will lick him up with tala even the crab
NTLifuwI7Dg,323840,330479,it's small but it have a lot of way to  play about it yeah i think this is a  good omen for this trip i'm very excited  to learn more after all of your troubles
NTLifuwI7Dg,330479,336880,yeah for putting runoff for that one big  offender thank you i have no idea what  you said  up and down this street you'll find
NTLifuwI7Dg,336880,343600,staples of kingston timeless classics  passed from generation to generation  that epitomize the flavors that locals
NTLifuwI7Dg,343600,350800,crave this is incredible what is going  on here just a few stalls down a common  breakfast that dates back to the 1800s
NTLifuwI7Dg,350800,357520,this dish comes at you in three phases  are these cucumbers yeah  really i usually hate cucumbers so do i
NTLifuwI7Dg,357520,364720,first the veggies a combination of  cucumber tomato onion and thyme cook  until the water vaporizes then add some
NTLifuwI7Dg,364720,370080,oil and continue simmering it's steamy  soft it's so fresh so delicious then  here's the fish
NTLifuwI7Dg,370080,377039,phase two the protein roasted salt fish  that's been rehydrating for hours before  finally joining the veggies the fish is
NTLifuwI7Dg,377039,383199,salted in order for it to travel that's  why we hydrate it not only to rehydrate  it but also to take some of the salt
NTLifuwI7Dg,383199,388400,open i've had something like this before  actually neon they dry fish like crazy  it reminds me of being there it's almost
NTLifuwI7Dg,388400,394560,like you're eating a fish jerky which is  why you have the raw see i'm witty phase  three the starch two chunks of roasted
NTLifuwI7Dg,394560,401759,yellow yam rest at the bottom of the  container top that with the fish and  veggies  this here is a specialty that mitzi also
NTLifuwI7Dg,401759,406880,inherited from her mother this is why  them say ucn boat runs so fast when he  won and got the world record yellow
NTLifuwI7Dg,406880,411919,yummy you couldn't find it in jamaica it  was so long oh  i love it
NTLifuwI7Dg,411919,417840,it's almost like this fish is like a  seasoning to the whole dish because the  yam is starchy it's good but there's no  seasoning on that so you take a big bite
NTLifuwI7Dg,417840,423840,of this it's chewing is super salty and  then you balance it out with the yam  over here
NTLifuwI7Dg,424160,430319,it is almost shocking to me to see  something this complex this  deliciousness right here on the side of  the street meanwhile her grill is made
NTLifuwI7Dg,430319,435360,out of tire rims welcome to jam rack  yeah dude
NTLifuwI7Dg,435360,442400,if you want food without all the traffic  buzzing by might i suggest a cook shop  small diners with a rotating menu and
NTLifuwI7Dg,442400,448880,affordable prices what's more common  than street food like we had already or  the cook shop like this they're both on  the same connotation of level i mean
NTLifuwI7Dg,448880,455199,some people feel for something on a  certain day you wake up you want a crab  you want a soup after that no this is  lunch so this is actually what we would
NTLifuwI7Dg,455199,460400,do on a regular basis today at annie's  they're serving up something called  aki's
NTLifuwI7Dg,460400,466800,it's made even more special when you  realize this national dish is nearly  impossible to get outside of jamaica
NTLifuwI7Dg,466800,472879,you'll see why soon  that's looking good yeah i'm on but  first an appetizer first of all boiled
NTLifuwI7Dg,472879,478240,banana boiled green banana what's going  on there all of this on the left side we  don't call it banana we don't call it
NTLifuwI7Dg,478240,484319,yam what we have we call it food  it tastes 90 like a potato and 10 like  an unripe banana oh it's good though
NTLifuwI7Dg,484319,490479,it's very good but i noticed like  there's a lot of places where the usa  has a lot of bread asia has a lot of  rice but so far here you just have a lot
NTLifuwI7Dg,490479,495520,of starches food food that way then here  this is the liver from what animal  cauliflower
NTLifuwI7Dg,495520,501440,coal cow  cow cow  these boiled green bananas are meant to
NTLifuwI7Dg,501440,508080,be paired with this a stewed liver  marinated in jamaican seasonings and  cooked down in oil
NTLifuwI7Dg,508080,514080,oh all right no this is glazed with this  beautiful sweet and savory sauce it's  very dense a little heavy so i can see
NTLifuwI7Dg,514080,519279,why that would pair well with the food  the food  today we're in luck because this cook
NTLifuwI7Dg,519279,526320,shop is cooking up aki and salt fish  this is the country's national dish  marvin yes sir and marva is here to tell

NTLifuwI7Dg,537120,542959,in a way that i can't and i think it's  the way i talk it's a bit formal iguana  something you have to know right now how
NTLifuwI7Dg,542959,549760,do i say nice to meet you wag one or one  one is a mixture of english spanish and
NTLifuwI7Dg,549760,556880,the west african akan language how long  they placed there 22 years all right the  vocabulary and pronunciation vary quite
NTLifuwI7Dg,556880,562959,a bit from standard english hey bless up  yourself disappearances and we all agree  i'm not being racist no fantastic
NTLifuwI7Dg,562959,568880,youtube comments there you go eat it  we're here for a very special reason
NTLifuwI7Dg,568880,574150,we're here for what i'm told it's the  national dish of jamaica it's called  what's it called aki
NTLifuwI7Dg,574150,579600,[Music]  originally comes from africa it looks  like something you would find from  avatar but its seeds were brought here
NTLifuwI7Dg,579600,586640,in the 18th century it would have been  closed up on the tree right and then it  pops open yeah it releases gases
NTLifuwI7Dg,586640,592640,actually so i really scare sometimes we  all release gas when we this much
NTLifuwI7Dg,593120,599120,from this beautiful flowering fruit only  one part is edible and it must be  prepared carefully you have to wait
NTLifuwI7Dg,599120,605279,until it opens out so the pot has to  open before you consume it if ingested  while unripe while its gases remain
NTLifuwI7Dg,605279,610480,inside you could be victim to vomiting  or worse some have even died can i eat
NTLifuwI7Dg,610480,616320,this raw some people do eat it raw am i  some people right now i'm not
NTLifuwI7Dg,616320,621440,i'm not eater  oh
NTLifuwI7Dg,621440,627920,it tastes like boiled edamame beans well  i love that this is so good yes i never  eat it like that before to me that was
NTLifuwI7Dg,627920,635040,already great but now you're going to  dress it up you're going to do way more  to it marvin respect and manners you're  welcome preparing the aki is a
NTLifuwI7Dg,635040,641440,time-consuming process the fleshy yellow  bits must be removed from the black seed  and the body of the plant now that we
NTLifuwI7Dg,641440,647040,have our key ingredient it's time to  cook  first veggies are cooked in a load of
NTLifuwI7Dg,647040,654079,oil tomatoes onions scotch bonnets and  scallions are a must but don't forget  the salt fish
NTLifuwI7Dg,654079,660880,next boil the aki and add it to the main  pot with a dash of black pepper the aki  and saltfish are paired with some dense
NTLifuwI7Dg,660880,667200,fried dumplings made of flour lasko milk  powder and baking powder
NTLifuwI7Dg,667920,673519,the national dish of jamaica the  national this was not on the syllabus  like a johnny cake it is exactly
NTLifuwI7Dg,673519,678640,ajanicue yeah you know sometimes i do  feel like a food expert you are a food  expert not like i got a degree or
NTLifuwI7Dg,678640,685760,something nowadays you get a degree with  the amount of years you've been studying  something or doing it as work i'm pretty  sure you have your doctorate right now
NTLifuwI7Dg,685760,693600,but you wouldn't usually eat it plain  that's what goes with the akian sausage  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,693600,701040,oh so good  [Music]  that is one of the best things i've ever  had creamy smooth the flavor after it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,701040,706160,been cooked like this it changes you're  not going to like how i address it it's  like canned mushrooms yeah i like canned
NTLifuwI7Dg,706160,711600,mushrooms i don't like canned mushrooms  and before it had a lot of body to it  now it's like fluffy it's so soft it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,711600,716720,creamy this is outstanding now you're  getting into the google change the  favorite profile by adding it to the
NTLifuwI7Dg,716720,722639,journey  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,722639,728560,like reggae music the influences that we  have to jamaica aki is something that  speaks jamaica every time you taste it
NTLifuwI7Dg,728560,733600,is this something that's gone  international it hasn't gone  international like jerk chicken it's  something that is more local but a
NTLifuwI7Dg,733600,739760,reason for it being is not readily grown  up north or further it's specific to  here nowadays you can buy canned aqui
NTLifuwI7Dg,739760,746160,but i'm going to tell you right off the  bat no because we want that canned  mushroom flavor and that's not going to  come from canned.com thank you chef big
NTLifuwI7Dg,746160,752079,up chef the biggest stops possible that  sounded more russian i'm working on it
NTLifuwI7Dg,752240,759760,one third of this country's population  lives in this city kingston has varied  culinary influences african spanish and
NTLifuwI7Dg,759760,766000,british among them here you'll find the  birthplace of jerk cooking and spices  you'll find the food usain bolt eats
NTLifuwI7Dg,766000,773279,every morning but you might also find  certain offcuts that are turning on  local eaters here's one now oh yeah yeah
NTLifuwI7Dg,773279,779200,finally i get some rice what am i  looking at here look at some curry  coffee with some broad beans these beans  are so broad
NTLifuwI7Dg,779200,785680,our last location is actually not here  just a few steps away you'll find  anneliese restaurant catering authentic
NTLifuwI7Dg,785680,790800,jamaican cuisine while utilizing some  seriously unique cuts of meat first up
NTLifuwI7Dg,790800,795839,curried cow foot what am i supposed to  do with this that's been pressure cooked  with broad beans if you're in jamaica
NTLifuwI7Dg,795839,801839,you love that they give you that piece  it's kind of like cankles look at this  you got a bone right there a big cross  section and then you can see the skin
NTLifuwI7Dg,801839,808800,all around it right here  oh wow it's gooey and gelatinous and  spicy seasoned well it's so thick and so
NTLifuwI7Dg,808800,814240,rich i mean it's probably 10 protein and  then a lot of fat and collagen in there  but i love this texture this is the kind
NTLifuwI7Dg,814240,820240,of texture i couldn't appreciate it when  i was a bit younger i think i had to  travel the world a bit more grow as on  your office
NTLifuwI7Dg,820240,825279,that is our appetizer i think from here  we should go and talk to the chef and  learn a lot more about this main course
NTLifuwI7Dg,825279,831760,the main course is something tricky not  everybody eat  well that laugh at the end was maniacal
NTLifuwI7Dg,831760,837680,jeff smith spent a lot of time in this  kitchen but before this he worked in the  backbreaking kitchens of new york
NTLifuwI7Dg,837680,843440,when i asked him what he misses about  the usa he  said for today's final meal he's
NTLifuwI7Dg,843440,850160,offering up something first of all  barely recognizable i mean if salvador  dali was gone and he designed a cow
NTLifuwI7Dg,850160,856079,that's what it would look like it comes  straight from the butcher like that yeah  yeah did he boil it yeah and it's creepy
NTLifuwI7Dg,856079,861279,like all this now is edible from the  snout to the back of the brain and  everything in between yeah so what are
NTLifuwI7Dg,861279,867360,you gonna make from this what i'm gonna  make from this i'm going to make a dish  yeah all right well it's good sounds
NTLifuwI7Dg,867360,874160,good let's get going  this dish is known as cowhead brown stew  what may seem unique to you is a pretty
NTLifuwI7Dg,874160,879839,common dish in this area there's a lot  of thing here that have to remove oh so  you don't eat that no no so you can eat
NTLifuwI7Dg,879839,886000,almost everything but not that part in  particular  this you don't eat this item all right
NTLifuwI7Dg,886000,891519,all right so i'm cleaning it up now okay  so maybe you don't eat the whole thing  but okay i'm telling you you can eat a
NTLifuwI7Dg,891519,898320,lot of it all right we got the tongue  over here so this is the eye now i know  for sure you can eat the eye in mexico i
NTLifuwI7Dg,898320,904480,had we don't eat the eye  oh you said we used to dissect it in  school some people eat it but i don't do
NTLifuwI7Dg,904480,909519,it like that  if you don't clean it properly then you  won't get a nice taste from it we want a
NTLifuwI7Dg,909519,916399,nice one we want a nice taste all right  mr smith this is fantastic i can't wait  to try out this dish we'll see you soon
NTLifuwI7Dg,917040,923920,the flavor base begins with scallions  thyme onions and scotch bonnet peppers  used to saturate the cow head along with
NTLifuwI7Dg,923920,929360,jerk seasoning and browning sauce  pressure cook for 15 minutes before
NTLifuwI7Dg,929360,934959,finally adding in the beans  so same rice same rice and then here you
NTLifuwI7Dg,934959,941839,can see big thick pieces of skin they're  so jelly like it's so gelatinous try it  out
NTLifuwI7Dg,942720,950320,oh it's so soft so tender we had skin  earlier today also cow skin but that one  was a lot more chewy this is super soft
NTLifuwI7Dg,950320,957360,the sauce is thick  rich heavy with a little bit of heat  nice starchy beans than just super  gelatinous wiggly-ass meat nice but what
NTLifuwI7Dg,957360,964240,you're supposed to do is mix up  everything mix it up should all balance  each other out right come on  everything's supposed to balance  everything and come together
NTLifuwI7Dg,964240,970720,delicious but ma'am it's a great start  [Music]  jamaica has a lot to offer and for this
NTLifuwI7Dg,970720,977759,to be the start of your journey i don't  think you could ask for anything more  because the flavors are there the unique  dishes are there
NTLifuwI7Dg,977759,983360,part of this journey for me is cracking  the code learning more about the people  how is it that just such a small island
NTLifuwI7Dg,983360,990160,can be so powerful and can produce so  many icons a little what we tell our the  energy the vibe of jamaica the
NTLifuwI7Dg,990160,996399,inspiration throughout i mean you speak  of bob marley's  we are the birthplace of marcus garvey
NTLifuwI7Dg,996399,1002160,we have great athletes usain bolt is our  living legend we have the fastest woman  alive nba as well patrick ewing is
NTLifuwI7Dg,1002160,1007680,jamaican so this little place has  provided so many people with the  opportunity to be great and it comes

NTLifuwI7Dg,1120840,1127039,magnificent this is what a pretty  typical jamaican breakfast looks like it  starts with boiled dumplings usually

NTLifuwI7Dg,1157120,1163440,yeah this is what we call a slice fish  so it's like these massive fishes that  they kind of cook down and so this is a  brown stew version of that fish i'm not
NTLifuwI7Dg,1163440,1169919,sure what's the name of this particular  fish but it's brown stewed it's salty  it's firm it reminds me of some  countries have fish has street food and
NTLifuwI7Dg,1169919,1175440,they cook it and then it just hangs out  all day and then when people are ready  they throw it on the plate so it can be  a little bit hard but it's all right it
NTLifuwI7Dg,1175440,1180559,gives it a little bit of texture and  then this right here these are just big  heavy beautiful dumplings they call them

NTLifuwI7Dg,1274080,1279120,that does hoses the original traditions  of rastafari
NTLifuwI7Dg,1279120,1285760,tucked away in these mountains lies a  commune where a small devoted population  learns and worships are there people who
NTLifuwI7Dg,1285760,1291679,live there full-time yeah full-time  fully for them but to get there you not  only need to climb this mountainside you

NTLifuwI7Dg,1326720,1329720,rastafari
NTLifuwI7Dg,1333440,1339600,many rosters limit their diet to what  they consider pure and natural that  means no processed food no artificial
NTLifuwI7Dg,1339600,1345760,seasoning coloring or preservatives  there's not a lot of powders or  processed seasonings the food eaten here
NTLifuwI7Dg,1345760,1350480,is grown locally or harvested straight  from the source
NTLifuwI7Dg,1351730,1358720,[Music]  [Applause]  their diet is also free of alcohol
NTLifuwI7Dg,1358720,1366399,cigarettes and drugs  except for one  and that one is used a lot

NTLifuwI7Dg,1402720,1408960,healthy as they mostly grow their own  organic food this tradition has roots in  the distrust of our current modern food
NTLifuwI7Dg,1408960,1417640,system and supply chain a system that  often relies on chemicals pesticides  preservatives and gmos
NTLifuwI7Dg,1425040,1431200,[Music]  whether these fears are justified or  debatable one thing is certain the
NTLifuwI7Dg,1431200,1437440,rastafari diet is evidence that eating  organic food doesn't have to be boring  or expensive
NTLifuwI7Dg,1437440,1443679,can you show me this one yeah this is  the congo peas tango like in africa yes  oh these are great we're going to make

NTLifuwI7Dg,1456840,1461919,perfect standards for cooking and eating  here are just one facet of the rastafari
NTLifuwI7Dg,1461919,1467920,lifestyle  the faith itself is the bedrock upon  which all else is
NTLifuwI7Dg,1467920,1473279,[Music]  unsanta for your built and cast and all
NTLifuwI7Dg,1473279,1478960,the faces shine upon us that children  that we shall be safe and redeem the  rastafari lifestyle has deep roots in
NTLifuwI7Dg,1478960,1484480,christianity  their holy book the bible their paradise
NTLifuwI7Dg,1484480,1491200,africa and their divine guiding spirit  god also goes by a different name john
NTLifuwI7Dg,1491200,1497760,their wise prophet hail selassie king of  ethiopia in the 1930s
NTLifuwI7Dg,1499200,1504559,the word rastafarianism comes from ross  tafari mokhane the pre-regnal title of
NTLifuwI7Dg,1504559,1512590,his majesty the faith teaches redemption  for african descendants and their  repatriation to zion or africa
NTLifuwI7Dg,1512590,1515659,[Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,1518640,1525120,back in the kitchen john wordy is  cooking up a feast  first boiled dumplings different from
NTLifuwI7Dg,1525120,1531440,what we've tried this morning as they're  made with whole wheat flour and cornmeal  the dough is manipulated into the shape
NTLifuwI7Dg,1531440,1537600,of a banana then plopped into a pot and  left to boil  in the meantime the chef prepares ground
NTLifuwI7Dg,1537600,1542880,provisions or root vegetables dashin or  taro there's also cocoa another kind of
NTLifuwI7Dg,1542880,1549919,sweet potato and green bananas  all these will join the dumplings
NTLifuwI7Dg,1549919,1556320,i'm in dinner time here we go this looks  excellent oh my gosh so this is a banana  we had this morning no that's a spinners
NTLifuwI7Dg,1556320,1561919,a dumpling but in a different form oh  you're right as i bit into it i was like  wait that's just dough
NTLifuwI7Dg,1561919,1568400,yeah it tastes like whole wheat because  people just use cornmeal and flour only  but they add the wheat flour there's not  that much process it's healthier it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,1568400,1574000,gonna pass through a bit easier to your  system we're going to be pooping good  tonight if you're feeling down and for
NTLifuwI7Dg,1574000,1579760,you how hard is it to stick to the diet  of a rastafarian there's levels to it  the real diet of our crease like
NTLifuwI7Dg,1579760,1585279,rastafaris is fasting where they really  don't eat that much they just live off  the air and water and there's fruits how
NTLifuwI7Dg,1585279,1592080,many calories are in air i have no idea  i'm pretty sure it's like probably right  all right but for people who can't live  off air then what the next level is then
NTLifuwI7Dg,1592080,1597360,vegan the next step would be vegetarian  food what are we eating right now and  then there's the next level where  there's some of us eat fish along with
NTLifuwI7Dg,1597360,1605278,this so we don't eat any other meat but  i eat fish i find it hard giving up the  fish but no goat no chicken no beef
NTLifuwI7Dg,1606960,1612400,although some rastafarians still eat  fish for most meat is something taboo as  it's considered
NTLifuwI7Dg,1612400,1618320,dead food that will not provide your  body with energy but on the contrary  strip it away there's a rooster down
NTLifuwI7Dg,1618320,1624799,here i love the idea of a rooster going  into a food hall takes a lot of balls  right no he knows he's safe here nobody  eats it oh yeah that's right exactly
NTLifuwI7Dg,1624799,1630339,what's the point of having a rooster  here it's a part of the family  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,1630480,1636320,next up congo bean stew remember those  congo beans soaked in coconut juice  they're simply boiled with chopped
NTLifuwI7Dg,1636320,1640840,carrots okra and irish potatoes
NTLifuwI7Dg,1641760,1647360,let's try it out  definitely taste the coconut yeah the  coconut gives it some natural sweetness
NTLifuwI7Dg,1647360,1654720,oh yeah that's that's like the secret  ingredient like coconut milk mixed with  beans beans are nice and starchy there's  okra in there carrots that's nice
NTLifuwI7Dg,1654720,1661520,now the star of today's table steamed  vegetables with aki aki is a type of  fruit a distant cousin of lychee and
NTLifuwI7Dg,1661520,1666880,longitude  start by boiling the freshly picked aki
NTLifuwI7Dg,1666880,1673679,then prepare the vegetables so delicious  vegetable calaloo  cabbage
NTLifuwI7Dg,1673679,1679519,onion  tomato  pepper
NTLifuwI7Dg,1679760,1685200,put the veggies in a separate pot and  let them cook  when it's nice and soft season with sea
NTLifuwI7Dg,1685200,1691760,salt and add the boiled aki mix well and  serve  so i had aki on my first day in jamaica
NTLifuwI7Dg,1691760,1697240,and so is this like similar thing but  without the salt fish yeah
NTLifuwI7Dg,1697520,1702640,oh yeah very different from the aki i  had yesterday much more like gentle  flavors like i actually tasted cabbage
NTLifuwI7Dg,1702640,1708240,not super seasoned gentle light and you  can really just taste the vegetables  themselves typical jamaicans we just add
NTLifuwI7Dg,1708240,1713440,a little black pepper all these other  things to spice it up but really this is  how it should be eaten this is fantastic
NTLifuwI7Dg,1713440,1719919,it was a pleasure hanging out with you  today enjoying a meal with you and to  learning more about the rastafari people  what's behind this place this way of
NTLifuwI7Dg,1719919,1724440,life and especially the food delicious
NTLifuwI7Dg,1726880,1733200,our caribbean culinary adventure  continues here on the island of jamaica
NTLifuwI7Dg,1734640,1740640,today we're going on a cross-country  jerk tour  starting with the classics the oil drum
NTLifuwI7Dg,1740640,1746320,is unique how long do you think you have  to cook inside of it to get rid of the  uh oil flavor
NTLifuwI7Dg,1746320,1752159,ending with an entire freaking pig have  you done this before yes i've done it a  few times have you ever been surprised
NTLifuwI7Dg,1752159,1759039,in a bad way  so what's so special about jamaican jerk  and how did it become world renowned
NTLifuwI7Dg,1759039,1765279,well it all starts  here  heading 70 miles from kingston to the
NTLifuwI7Dg,1765279,1771760,northeast tip of the island we'll bring  you here portland this is the home of  jerk
NTLifuwI7Dg,1771760,1777760,the standard next to which every  jamaican jerk could be compared here  right on the side of the street you'll
NTLifuwI7Dg,1777760,1783760,find jerk come the traditional way  open it up big reveal
NTLifuwI7Dg,1783760,1790240,[Music]  i'm told this is called pan chicken one  chicken locally i call it pan fold it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,1790240,1796480,made in an old oil drum  so what that does it recreates the  original style of jerk where it was
NTLifuwI7Dg,1796480,1802240,underground where the smoke was up into  it because you have to have smoke and  jerk this jerk chicken is grilled over
NTLifuwI7Dg,1802240,1809039,charcoal but first it's doused in a  spicy pungent marination of spices only  available here in jamaica here's how
NTLifuwI7Dg,1809039,1816000,it's done by the bow this is the  original jerk season that i use this is  blended scotch bonnet pepper that i
NTLifuwI7Dg,1816000,1821200,already pre-blended here the seasoning  is called seasoning to the bone
NTLifuwI7Dg,1821200,1828960,this is a jerk seasoning it's made of  natural jamaican herbs like pimento  berries blended dried crushed pepper
NTLifuwI7Dg,1828960,1836720,this is the all-purpose seasoning the  same thing like the drink seasoning but  it's more refined  one tablespoon of garlic powder mix all
NTLifuwI7Dg,1836720,1843200,together until it has this nice light  brown color  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,1843200,1850880,rub that on the chicken along with thyme  onion and scallions and let it soak up  those flavors for 25 minutes
NTLifuwI7Dg,1850880,1856990,toss it on a custom grill made from an  old oil drum and keep it hot avoiding  direct contact with the flames
NTLifuwI7Dg,1856990,1863200,[Music]  your chicken's probably the most popular
NTLifuwI7Dg,1863200,1869760,but what is it that makes something  jerky it is the marinade process it  looks delicious we should try it out
NTLifuwI7Dg,1875039,1880799,salty spicy the scotch bonnet is very  unique it's like a heating pad in the  winter it's a nice lingering heat it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,1880799,1886559,not intense so it just stays there and  it just hums yeah you see the thing is  with jerk we have two important
NTLifuwI7Dg,1886559,1891840,ingredients which are grown in jamaica  better than anywhere in the world  pimento the scotch bunny all of that
NTLifuwI7Dg,1891840,1897360,combined up with other seasonings is  what creates this magnificent drugstore  i could just eat and listen to you talk
NTLifuwI7Dg,1897360,1903360,all day  oh even the white meat is soft and  tender and juicy everything is juicy
NTLifuwI7Dg,1903360,1908640,that's his festival  is a type of fried bread that's usually  paired with jerk chicken it's made from
NTLifuwI7Dg,1908640,1914399,flour cornmeal salt baking powder water  and sugar it's also addictive when you
NTLifuwI7Dg,1914399,1920960,finish eating you'll blow it up like a  puffer fish  no sweet heavy crunchy outside doughy
NTLifuwI7Dg,1920960,1927200,inside it helps to stuff up some of the  heat of the scotch bonnet pepper that we  just spoke about i've learned one of the  best compliments you can give to food in
NTLifuwI7Dg,1927200,1933840,jamaica is  nice nice yum  our first and most affordable location
NTLifuwI7Dg,1933840,1939360,is a great entry point into the world of  jerk but here in jamaica you can jerk  anything
NTLifuwI7Dg,1939360,1945039,well i mean  any food i think you get my point  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,1945039,1950640,our next stop right here gold teeth jerk  center located on fairy hill just a few
NTLifuwI7Dg,1950640,1956799,minutes from boston beach here they  offer a range of protein options folks  come here for their traditional jerk
NTLifuwI7Dg,1956799,1962720,technique we can do the turkey gourd  rabbit reindeer whatever you want  there'll be cookies
NTLifuwI7Dg,1962720,1968000,yeah  meet the chef jay james how you doing  bro good
NTLifuwI7Dg,1968000,1974080,me too i feel like i just smoked two  packs of cigarettes i don't know why you  and jamaica get used to the smoke i'm  used to a different kind of smoke and
NTLifuwI7Dg,1974080,1980960,that's what i'm saying when you're in  jamaica  unlike the typical grilling over steel  grates everything here is notably
NTLifuwI7Dg,1980960,1986480,grilled on top of wood  is the wood actually giving flavor to
NTLifuwI7Dg,1986480,1992559,the meat yes man the wood give flavor as  well this is pimento wood with even  thicker boards on top to help hold in
NTLifuwI7Dg,1992559,1998399,some heat what's so special about the  pimento wood oh my god you can see this  one sweating
NTLifuwI7Dg,1998399,2005360,give it the flavor this one's sweating  too yeah how are you doing i want some  underneath it all charcoal emitting heat
NTLifuwI7Dg,2005360,2011760,and flavorful smoke also from pimento  wood it goes from raw to cooked lots of  cocoa right here it must take a while
NTLifuwI7Dg,2011760,2017360,because the wood isn't burning how long  does it take six hours oh that's a long  time low and slow the other reason we
NTLifuwI7Dg,2017360,2023440,came here not just for the way you're  grilling it the way you're preparing the  meat but also the different types of  meat you have available here it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,2023440,2029120,different than other places here  you're serving rabbit yes
NTLifuwI7Dg,2029120,2034240,why rabbit  it's famous meat no on the black you  know yeah
NTLifuwI7Dg,2034240,2040640,the rabbit is cleaned and all its organs  are put aside time for the marination  we've got the pimento right over here
NTLifuwI7Dg,2040640,2045840,give it a flavor we're gonna go over the  jerk sauce  the rabbit is rubbed down with a secret
NTLifuwI7Dg,2045840,2052720,jerk sauce but even the most secret jerk  sauce must contain a couple of key  ingredients pimento berries spices and
NTLifuwI7Dg,2052720,2059839,scotch bonnet peppers this is the liver  this is the kidney stuff it after  marinating it's brought to grill for six
NTLifuwI7Dg,2059839,2066720,hours  [Music]  so with rabbit sometimes it can be a bit  dry and doesn't have a lot of fan how do
NTLifuwI7Dg,2066720,2072000,you keep it moist slow fire if you're  gonna blaze a fire it's gonna dry down  you have to know the country wallet this
NTLifuwI7Dg,2072000,2077118,is the rabbit right here oh it's  interesting the way you prepared it here  the rabbit it almost looks like chicken
NTLifuwI7Dg,2077118,2084320,it tastes like chicken tastes like  chicken  i'm in waguan
NTLifuwI7Dg,2084320,2090480,that's it right  i'm very curious about this is it rabbit  very common meat here not very common
NTLifuwI7Dg,2090480,2095679,but what it is it's grown a lot  throughout jamaica because they breed a  lot what do you think is the best part
NTLifuwI7Dg,2095679,2101960,of a freaking rabbit the legend thai  right they're looking [ __ ] i'm gonna try  it out cheers
NTLifuwI7Dg,2104480,2111520,getting a little pepper yeah low heat  but a lot of juice which is impressive i  mean this animal has almost no fat it's  almost like a nice juicy moist chicken
NTLifuwI7Dg,2111520,2118000,breast and it's smoky i'm gonna get a  little bit of sauce you don't need too  much because trust me the heat is on it
NTLifuwI7Dg,2118000,2124240,and the heat is in it all so hot but  it's all nice it's not the intense heat  no it's a manageable heat you see when
NTLifuwI7Dg,2124240,2131359,you start acting or sowing like you're  pregnant then you know the pepper nice i  think the reason some people faint when  they eat hot food is because they go
NTLifuwI7Dg,2131359,2137920,on oxygen yeah they hyperventilate  this is a rabbit it's an appetizer we
NTLifuwI7Dg,2137920,2144480,still have a whole goat like we have  you ready one what leg please sir
NTLifuwI7Dg,2144480,2152400,put it like that try to use the meat off  the leg  no  we're going to drink sauce
NTLifuwI7Dg,2152400,2158720,stuff the sauce inside  that's a permanent  flavor let it soak for two hours then we
NTLifuwI7Dg,2158720,2163760,put it on wood  uh right here a whole leg of a goat let
NTLifuwI7Dg,2163760,2169200,me pick it up i think we could just give  it a little bit of a split still smell  that is a ram goat can you smell that a
NTLifuwI7Dg,2169200,2175680,ram goat yeah one a woman a man i can't  you can smell the different kind of  mango and lemon goat
NTLifuwI7Dg,2175680,2182400,take a look at this man he really works  at coating all the meat massage that  seasoning right down into it cheers
NTLifuwI7Dg,2182400,2189520,cheers  super juicy wow it's very goaty oh i'm  bad to have spicy milk
NTLifuwI7Dg,2189520,2195599,this is the same spice same drop  seasoning on it you can taste a little  bit of the heat as well it's interesting  seeing the jerk seasoning placed with
NTLifuwI7Dg,2195599,2201119,different proteins because it brings out  different flavors i still taste the goat  itself but there's still the powerful
NTLifuwI7Dg,2201119,2207200,jerk flavor the scotch bonnet it's hot  it's spicy and there's the smokiness  from the wood from the fire you come to
NTLifuwI7Dg,2207200,2214359,jamaica you need the smoke whether it's  from the jerk or something else the  smoke has to be
NTLifuwI7Dg,2214560,2220640,today was just a warm up yeah i'm on  tomorrow  something i didn't even know was  possible we're jerking a whole pig it
NTLifuwI7Dg,2220640,2226800,doesn't sound right but it's gonna look  right i can guarantee you that and taste  even better
NTLifuwI7Dg,2226800,2232720,these  for our final jerk experience we're  heading 130 miles to the northwestern
NTLifuwI7Dg,2232720,2237839,coast of jamaica this is montego bay the  second largest city in jamaica after
NTLifuwI7Dg,2237839,2243119,kingston  [Music]  i've come here to see an entire pig get
NTLifuwI7Dg,2243119,2249359,jerked and this is the jerk master  himself chef what's going on it's a very  impractical location for an interview
NTLifuwI7Dg,2249359,2256079,and that's how the creative minds work  you know yeah it's gonna look beautiful  i hope so  andrew a jamaican jerk competition
NTLifuwI7Dg,2256079,2262000,champion in 2019 he's not even a  full-time chef but with love and a  passion for cooking he's mastered the
NTLifuwI7Dg,2262000,2267040,art of jerk you can jerk anything that  you want yeah you know what i'm saying
NTLifuwI7Dg,2267040,2274079,really i tried everything i've done bird  i've done rabbit i've done fish i've  done big of course i've done chicken
NTLifuwI7Dg,2274079,2279519,it's a love for me so i have the show  for the show
NTLifuwI7Dg,2279680,2286160,today his approach is a long lost one  cooking underground today you're doing a  whole pig have you done this before yes
NTLifuwI7Dg,2286160,2292720,i have how many times maybe about six  seven times before how do you make sure  no sand gets in the meat we line it with
NTLifuwI7Dg,2292720,2298560,the banana leaves so the banana leaves  basically protects the pig from the sun  how do you know for sure when it's done
NTLifuwI7Dg,2298560,2305760,have you ever been surprised in a bad  way  no never  first up andrew prepares the pit digging
NTLifuwI7Dg,2305760,2311680,sand to a depth of about two feet  layer in sheet metal and secure it with
NTLifuwI7Dg,2311680,2318480,rocks  add a layer of pimento wood to give off  a distinct aroma
NTLifuwI7Dg,2318480,2324160,add heat and let the fire do the work  this is the base  all right so we're going to get the jerk
NTLifuwI7Dg,2324160,2330079,seasoning ready if put on the pig  automatically have a start to the spice  of life i will get the fermented all
NTLifuwI7Dg,2330079,2336720,powder just as chengdu china celebrates  their szechuan peppercorns jamaica  celebrates their pimento both these
NTLifuwI7Dg,2336720,2343119,peppercorns have a distinct potent  flavor that you could not compare to  ordinary black pepper get it all dusty
NTLifuwI7Dg,2343119,2348240,then we're going to do the scotch bunny  add some vinegar and some water
NTLifuwI7Dg,2348240,2354720,add some garlic some fresh thyme  scallion now i can add my pimento to it
NTLifuwI7Dg,2354720,2360480,with the seasoning what does the  seasoning absolutely have to have in  order to be called jerk absolutely
NTLifuwI7Dg,2360480,2366800,important in any jerk you have to have  pimento and you have to have scotch  bonnet when it's mixed into the all the
NTLifuwI7Dg,2366800,2373599,other ingredients and stuff it just  brings out an amazing flavor and once  you get that incorporated with any meat
NTLifuwI7Dg,2373599,2378800,at all it's like heaven wow i got really  lost in your beautiful words
NTLifuwI7Dg,2378800,2383920,now we need the pig let's get this pig  ready trying to get little grooves so
NTLifuwI7Dg,2383920,2389680,the seasoning can soak right down into  under the skin  he applies a dry rub jerk seasoning that
NTLifuwI7Dg,2389680,2395440,includes a blend of herbs and spices  flip them over  usually cinnamon thyme cayenne pepper
NTLifuwI7Dg,2395440,2401520,garlic onion and allspice  then he adds his own wet rub give it a
NTLifuwI7Dg,2401520,2407119,good massage and let it marinate no this  is what you call it cocoa butter good  for the skin
NTLifuwI7Dg,2407119,2413280,do you think the jerk is it all about  the seasoning or about the cooking  technique too it's a mixture of  everything because everybody tried their
NTLifuwI7Dg,2413280,2418880,own spices and herbs and different  mixtures and stuff like that but even if  you put it and you don't have the
NTLifuwI7Dg,2418880,2425440,technique and the passion because it  takes time jerk is not something that  you don't show showing the grill i want  to turn color it good you're looking for
NTLifuwI7Dg,2425440,2432640,a texture you're looking for flavor  you're looking for a smell you're  looking for if it got crispy everything  is a process
NTLifuwI7Dg,2432720,2438880,the pig is ready the pit is set time to  make the bed  andrew layers the cooking grape with
NTLifuwI7Dg,2438880,2444480,even more pimento leaves to give it more  flavor although they come with flavors  as a pimento the spice of jamaica you
NTLifuwI7Dg,2444480,2449839,use it in anything it's in the blend  it's in the leaves it's in the berries  now the most important step of this
NTLifuwI7Dg,2449839,2454960,process getting the pig tucked in for  bed you want the head of the butt the  head all right
NTLifuwI7Dg,2454960,2461280,i got the butt right here yes  all right let's go  if we fail we might end up having a raw
NTLifuwI7Dg,2461280,2467559,pig covered in salt be careful of your  step though should i step here yeah
NTLifuwI7Dg,2468079,2474720,all right lay it down here that's right  so it's on the grill it's on the pimento  leaves yes it's over the coal what's the
NTLifuwI7Dg,2474720,2481280,next step  line the sides also with leaves then i'm  gonna get another sheet cover it so the
NTLifuwI7Dg,2481280,2487839,sand won't be able to transition it this  is one of the most simple looking but  most ancient cooking structures used to
NTLifuwI7Dg,2487839,2494240,trap heat and bake smoke or steam food  when no other equipment is available is  this a jamaican style of cooking it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,2494240,2500160,really getting back to the roots of what  jerk is jerk is coming from the days  when the tainos and the maroons got
NTLifuwI7Dg,2500160,2507040,together they hunted the wild hogs  burying the hug that's how the jerk  process came about so whatever we have  passed those days and just our last
NTLifuwI7Dg,2507040,2513119,culture but when you get the meat it  just has a different flavor a different  texture even sometimes a different color
NTLifuwI7Dg,2513119,2520079,you'll see it and it looks pink or  reddish but then it's already cooked  it's a smoked flavor that goes through
NTLifuwI7Dg,2520079,2528000,it so they saw the fire don't cook it  with a smoke so that is why the process  takes six and a half hours
NTLifuwI7Dg,2529200,2536160,chef yes sir the moment is upon us yes  it is underneath this piece of  corrugated steel is a mystery all right
NTLifuwI7Dg,2536160,2541680,there's a wild hog  it's either done  or dead or or decorated
NTLifuwI7Dg,2541680,2547280,well either way it's most certainly dead  absolutely so step one remove this
NTLifuwI7Dg,2547280,2551319,all right try to be super careful
NTLifuwI7Dg,2554640,2561280,wow that's crazy the pig rolled over  while it was in there i wasn't expecting  that  this is black is that how it's supposed
NTLifuwI7Dg,2561280,2569040,to be yeah so are you gonna eat this  skin you can  straight up straight up oh yes
NTLifuwI7Dg,2569040,2573200,all right just up up  yeah man
NTLifuwI7Dg,2574319,2581599,as the chef as a guy pulling out of the  ground you have your back to the crowd  to the people who are going to be eating  it soon what's that one piece that you
NTLifuwI7Dg,2581599,2587520,can't resist to try immediately it's  either the butt  that part or either the rib i love the
NTLifuwI7Dg,2587520,2593760,rib you got that texture that everything  that you're looking for well i'm looking  for some rib then all right
NTLifuwI7Dg,2593760,2600800,oh this is nice super juicy i've never  seen pig skin like this where it's just  covered in jerk seasoning it's become
NTLifuwI7Dg,2600800,2607329,like a hardened paste yeah cheers  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,2608720,2615280,oh yeah  that pop  you're so juicy it's hard to describe  that pimento it gives a certain kind of
NTLifuwI7Dg,2615280,2620400,freshness to it there's a spice i feel  the warmth like all the way from my  mouth to my belly oh it's so delicious
NTLifuwI7Dg,2620400,2626240,are you are you on your second rib now  he's like yup keep talking
NTLifuwI7Dg,2627200,2633200,oh he's just ripping the ankle off oh  you can try that thank you sir oh look  at this there's skin there's fat there's
NTLifuwI7Dg,2633200,2639680,protein there's a mix of textures and  tissues you want some i want all of it  oh okay
NTLifuwI7Dg,2640079,2645119,oh yeah completely different experience  than the ribs there's crunchy [ __ ] it's  moist and it's more interspersed with
NTLifuwI7Dg,2645119,2651599,fat all of this on the outside is what  kept everything moist on the inside  absolutely yeah i mean the pig is like  the perfect animal for cooking because
NTLifuwI7Dg,2651599,2658640,it's almost hard to mess it up and i  don't mean to take any credit away from  you but it's like nature's little  cooking vessel it has a thick skin it
NTLifuwI7Dg,2658640,2666078,keeps everything protected inside  this is fantastic chef you've outdone  yourself thank you very much lenny
NTLifuwI7Dg,2670160,2675440,chef andrew cuts up the roasted pig and  portions it out ribs tenderloin sirloin
NTLifuwI7Dg,2675440,2682000,belly bacon ham shoulder it's all  stacked up together except for the head  the head remains whole and we'll be
NTLifuwI7Dg,2682000,2687839,trying that soon  chairs cheers we're cheering these red
NTLifuwI7Dg,2687839,2693680,stripes so much i should be getting a  little sponsorship i think sponsored by  red stripe
NTLifuwI7Dg,2693680,2700000,right here this is the kidney i love it  all right cheers  little gaming a little different i like
NTLifuwI7Dg,2700000,2706720,it though  nice and soft like a little livery in  the texture but it's really just taking  on all those seasonings beautifully i
NTLifuwI7Dg,2706720,2712319,want to talk about this pimento this is  a spice that's used all over jamaica  everywhere in everything now when i find
NTLifuwI7Dg,2712319,2718000,new ingredients i like to try them just  raw so when i'm tasting it i can  identify it in a dish from then on yeah
NTLifuwI7Dg,2718000,2723760,right we're trying out  it's super fragrant
NTLifuwI7Dg,2723760,2729280,to me it's a mix of cloves a little mint  and pepper it has a little bit of a  numbing effect a little sting what the
NTLifuwI7Dg,2729280,2736319,szechuan peppercorn is to food in  chengdu china  this is to food in jamaica absolutely
NTLifuwI7Dg,2736319,2742960,this part right here the ears  do you hear that  it broke off so easily oh my god
NTLifuwI7Dg,2742960,2750800,oh wow  it's almost like a jerk jerk definitely  a dark jerk  crunchy tough although fatty interior
NTLifuwI7Dg,2750800,2756560,oh my god  dude it's so warm chef are you horrified  at home no no no no no
NTLifuwI7Dg,2756560,2762319,right there that is the money  oh that's my favorite bite yet that is
NTLifuwI7Dg,2762319,2768640,game ender right there  what's interesting to me is we've had  three different types of jerk and they  all use different cooking styles i mean
NTLifuwI7Dg,2768640,2773839,we had it on the pan we had it over the  pimento wood and then here underground  all the results are a little bit
NTLifuwI7Dg,2773839,2781119,different but there's still a thread  that connects them all too definitely  there's a seasoning thread that connects  it the pimento especially yeah now i
NTLifuwI7Dg,2781119,2786240,feel like i really get it what makes it  jerk and there's nothing else like it in  the world no incredible so
NTLifuwI7Dg,2786240,2791680,thank both of you cheers to that i  appreciate it man blessings
NTLifuwI7Dg,2796880,2802560,our caribbean culinary adventure  continues here on the island of jamaica  what are you going to make from this i'm
NTLifuwI7Dg,2802560,2808800,going to make a dish  yeah all right well  sounds good let's get going  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,2808800,2815200,today we're telling three different  stories of seafood in jamaica you're  going to attempt to fry this whole tuna
NTLifuwI7Dg,2815200,2820800,that's right from the rare creatures  caught and cooked in local villages i  saw one fisherman come in he had a
NTLifuwI7Dg,2820800,2825920,puffer fish those are poisonous no no no  to preparing and eating the caribbean's
NTLifuwI7Dg,2825920,2833440,most venomous fish beautiful fish but if  you get stuck by one of those  sharp barbs you're in for a bad day
NTLifuwI7Dg,2833440,2837280,it all starts  here
NTLifuwI7Dg,2842079,2848240,matt and i are starting the day in a  small village tucked away on the edge of  montego bay greeting us here jackie put
NTLifuwI7Dg,2848240,2853520,it there yeah where are we right now we  are in the greenspan fisherman beach  grange pen is one among hundreds of
NTLifuwI7Dg,2853520,2859119,fishing villages dotting jamaica's  coastline villages like this are made up  of modest houses built with wood and
NTLifuwI7Dg,2859119,2865860,sheet metal and they kind of have to  live here because they're right next to  the water they can jump in their boat  they go out they fish
NTLifuwI7Dg,2865860,2871359,[Music]  with their self-constructed boats and  locally made gear fishermen here leave
NTLifuwI7Dg,2871359,2876880,for the ocean at the crack of dawn and  they return when the sun is up and the  tide is low is there any type of fish
NTLifuwI7Dg,2876880,2882640,that if you catch it you throw it out  stingray is dangerous to the partner so  we will left him inside but i see people
NTLifuwI7Dg,2882640,2888720,they say it's viagra so why don't you  want to catch it more a successful catch  looks like a boat full of snappers
NTLifuwI7Dg,2888720,2896319,groupers jackfish doctor fish and  barracudas solo fishing like this makes  up 95 of the jamaican fishing industry i
NTLifuwI7Dg,2896319,2902000,saw one fisherman come in he had a  puffer fish those are poisonous no no no
NTLifuwI7Dg,2902000,2907839,according to national geographic  wikipedia and the japanese chef who once  prepared fugu for me the puffer fish
NTLifuwI7Dg,2907839,2914559,contains tetrodotoxin which is 1200  times more poisonous than cyanide
NTLifuwI7Dg,2914559,2921359,you've eaten that fish like sometimes  not out of that but you never felt  anything make your face numb like you  had a stroke no if someone knows certain
NTLifuwI7Dg,2921359,2928480,type of fish that you have a big head  and a small body you don't touch it i'm  like that on tinder big head small body
NTLifuwI7Dg,2928480,2934319,encouraged by jackie's confidence matt  and i decided to take a bite of puffer  fish freshly caught and grilled on the
NTLifuwI7Dg,2934319,2942439,spot that was until i saw how they  prepared it  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,2944000,2950400,i gotta say i've lost my nerve can't do  it  come to think about it the gentleman in  japan did have a certificate on his
NTLifuwI7Dg,2950400,2956559,restaurant wall and i mean does anyone  in this village have a special  certificate to prepare fugu in a way  that's not going to kill anybody they've
NTLifuwI7Dg,2956559,2964160,been cooking it for longer than sushi  chefs but they don't have a certain  thing so you feel comfortable i  feel like yeah exactly
NTLifuwI7Dg,2964160,2970319,here these were looking a lot more  tropical a little bit ago these are dr  fish why are they called them we got  them say that they're good for you
NTLifuwI7Dg,2970319,2976480,that's all i can give you it's all right  in the belief that seafood tastes best  in its natural form with its natural
NTLifuwI7Dg,2976480,2983359,flavors the preferred preparation here  is straightforward gut  roast done let me get to what we call a
NTLifuwI7Dg,2983359,2989520,plate oh thanks i'll take a plate  i go from right here right down to the  belly there and i just tear across so
NTLifuwI7Dg,2989520,2995440,once you tear across all of that white  meat comes off so i'm just gonna toss it  in my mouth right away
NTLifuwI7Dg,2995440,3001920,yeah no seasoning at all it's just warm  soft fishy natural flavors of the ocean  stretchy chewy skin and a liquid crunch
NTLifuwI7Dg,3001920,3007680,as well that's nice perfectly seasoned  by the caribbean this is like survival  cooking cooking at its most basic form
NTLifuwI7Dg,3007680,3016960,just grab the fish scale it gut it throw  it on a fire it's not pretty good that  was just an appetizer leading up to this
NTLifuwI7Dg,3018960,3025359,this is a caribbean king crab  these crabs are efficient cleaners of  coral reefs thanks to their diet based
NTLifuwI7Dg,3025359,3031440,on algae with that in mind fishermen  plant these crabs around their fishing  spots to create a better environment for
NTLifuwI7Dg,3031440,3038120,other species to spawn once these  cleaners grow fat it's their turn to  become part of the life cycle
NTLifuwI7Dg,3038120,3041159,[Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,3044640,3050240,usually you're going to see a big crab  like this steamed up or put in a pot of  boiling water but here it's going to be
NTLifuwI7Dg,3050240,3056640,grilled we're cooking it on a tire rim  i've never seen it done this way  it's midway through cooking right now
NTLifuwI7Dg,3056640,3061920,all right give it a little bit of a flip  all right  good flip it's kind of just bubbling and
NTLifuwI7Dg,3061920,3067680,boiling in its own shell at this point  and they wait for it to stop boiling as  soon as that's done we know the meat is

NTLifuwI7Dg,3097280,3103760,what it's like when you're trying to  open a hard-boiled egg and it just keeps  shattering into pieces and not actually  opening there's gonna be no crab left
NTLifuwI7Dg,3103760,3110160,get it  there you go  so much meat all that works it's so  voluminous i can hardly handle this
NTLifuwI7Dg,3110160,3116240,whole bite  i think i tasted something it was very  small
NTLifuwI7Dg,3116240,3121280,now the claws have to have something  inside  i'm looking for just the bite of all
NTLifuwI7Dg,3121280,3129119,bites we have to just tick time ah there  we go there we go there we go there we  go oh it's so solid you got a huge piece
NTLifuwI7Dg,3129119,3134960,oh this is perfect my hands got  chocolate and i'm just gonna put it on  my clean hand the meat it's like a dry
NTLifuwI7Dg,3134960,3140480,desert like all these separate little  muscle fibers and in between there's  delicious crabby juice what have you
NTLifuwI7Dg,3140480,3146079,done  well done is there still a tendon in the  middle no i took the tendon out oh dude  this could be the best bite in the world
NTLifuwI7Dg,3146079,3153359,should we beat each other i don't think  we can do that  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,3153359,3159760,yo best  bite ever it tastes buttery its own  juices just make it sweet and brings
NTLifuwI7Dg,3159760,3165359,together that meat perfectly if this  crab was alive right now it would be  blushing guys oh my god
NTLifuwI7Dg,3165359,3172079,yeah but i've had so many different  species i gotta say it's probably the  top a lot of crab is good it's good in  general it's got a bit of sweetness or a
NTLifuwI7Dg,3172079,3178720,bit of like briny seafoodiness to it  this is completely different an  incredible texture with every bite you  take you can feel the juices rushing out
NTLifuwI7Dg,3178720,3184160,of the meat and then it's just naturally  sweet but also just buttery almost like  an oil natural oil that's coming from
NTLifuwI7Dg,3184160,3189200,the crab meat maybe cooking it the way  he's cooked it keeps the oils in the  meat because when you boil it you always
NTLifuwI7Dg,3189200,3194640,see this like white pasty stuff around  the meat well that's all the fat that's  boiled out of the produce exactly and to
NTLifuwI7Dg,3194640,3199680,me when you boil it you bring the flavor  out when you steam it or you cook it  like this the flavor stays in yeah
NTLifuwI7Dg,3199680,3206000,absolutely  seafood story one complete  in our next chapter we'll see a chef
NTLifuwI7Dg,3206000,3211810,take on a seafood challenge of epic  proportions a record-breaking attempt  like you've never seen before
NTLifuwI7Dg,3211810,3215070,[Applause]
NTLifuwI7Dg,3217040,3222559,chef jeff  put her there pleasure to be here great  respect every time life is beautiful

NTLifuwI7Dg,3228960,3236400,we're going off menu i want to talk  about what we're eating today right here  that bad boy
NTLifuwI7Dg,3236400,3241440,this is a 30 pound yellow fin tuna a  whole yellow fin tuna i don't even
NTLifuwI7Dg,3241440,3246800,should i do an interview from here can  you see me getting your hands on a tuna  like this in jamaica is a real treat for
NTLifuwI7Dg,3246800,3253920,local chefs so jeff's plan for today  he's gonna fry it whole  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,3253920,3259119,have you ever fried a fish this big  before no it's the first time i'm going  to attend  a day
NTLifuwI7Dg,3259119,3265680,what's your strategy your square and  once you do that it's open up each layer  to the oil so you get that hot that's
NTLifuwI7Dg,3265680,3271359,penetrate to the fish the bone the meat  so that's going to be a lot of cuts is  it going to even be recognizable if the
NTLifuwI7Dg,3271359,3278000,family came here before it went into an  autopsy could they pull back the sheep  and identify this as a family member
NTLifuwI7Dg,3278000,3283520,no  no  [Music]  for a fish this huge they must construct
NTLifuwI7Dg,3283520,3288880,a pan big enough to suit its mighty  girth this sounds like an incredible  journey something that's never been done
NTLifuwI7Dg,3288880,3295520,before in this kitchen never with big  risk comes big reward and great  responsibility i kind of i think i don't
NTLifuwI7Dg,3295520,3301359,know while the oil tub slowly reaches  the required temperature the chef rubs  the fish with a blend of seasonings
NTLifuwI7Dg,3301359,3307160,making sure they reach every deep  crevice  then like ted bundy it's ready to fry
NTLifuwI7Dg,3307160,3312720,[Music]  you ready that's right they've got two
NTLifuwI7Dg,3312720,3317920,of these fryer tools they're gonna bring  it over to the oil and lower it in
NTLifuwI7Dg,3317920,3323920,descending  slowly  [Music]  and we just have to hope
NTLifuwI7Dg,3323920,3330079,oh my god it's crackling so far so good  it's not like those videos like when  they cook a turkey for thanksgiving and
NTLifuwI7Dg,3330079,3335920,it starts on fire  i'm bravely watching what's happening  from a safe distance he's slowly easing
NTLifuwI7Dg,3335920,3342559,the fish down into the oil he doesn't  want to do it too much yes it's in it's  fully in it's submerged oh this looks
NTLifuwI7Dg,3342559,3348079,awesome is it working yes  [Music]  how do you feel is this what you
NTLifuwI7Dg,3348079,3354400,expected yes so now i'm gonna get my  spoon what happened i just want this  side to start cooking so once we turn it
NTLifuwI7Dg,3354400,3361599,the cooking process already started so  it would be much easier wow this is a  huge tuna the cuts look perfect they
NTLifuwI7Dg,3361599,3367920,look clean it's like every little cut on  there is its own tuna fillet or tuna  steak you feel happy i'm happy i'm happy
NTLifuwI7Dg,3367920,3373119,i'm happy we're on the right track  add black pepper scotch bonded pepper
NTLifuwI7Dg,3373119,3381200,and garlic to the oil to enhance the  flavor of the oil itself  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,3381200,3387359,then the moment finally comes one of the  most epic flips in seafood history  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,3387359,3393760,it's super hard to flip because it's so  big and right now some of the skin is  peeling off a little bit but i think  they're managing pretty good it's just
NTLifuwI7Dg,3393760,3398880,going to get one flip that's it this is  the final flip
NTLifuwI7Dg,3398960,3405119,chef are you happy with the flip i'm so  happy perfect flip time perfect  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,3405119,3410400,and i'm just looking at a nice texture  oh my gosh the whole thing is in here  the eyes the face we can eat all of it
NTLifuwI7Dg,3410400,3416640,right that's right i enjoy the head yeah  yeah  leave the fish to fry for another five
NTLifuwI7Dg,3416640,3422640,to six minutes and keep adding hot oil  to the top like you're basting a turkey
NTLifuwI7Dg,3422799,3428000,when the fish is visually crisp it's  ready to leave all right this is the  most delicate part of the process now it
NTLifuwI7Dg,3428000,3435520,is frying it's so easy for the fish to  fall apart grabbing the whole thing it's  gonna go on a platter right next to it
NTLifuwI7Dg,3437280,3443440,boom right down on the checkered platter  and that is in one solid piece
NTLifuwI7Dg,3443440,3448880,oh chef wow  look at this fantastic job it looks  properly roasted all the way through
NTLifuwI7Dg,3448880,3455040,there's enough tuna steaks on here to  feed a whole village and soon i'm gonna  be trying this out myself i'm so excited
NTLifuwI7Dg,3455040,3460720,chef you've outdone yourself well done  and well done to you too what did i do  look at you all in the fish hey
NTLifuwI7Dg,3460720,3467280,yeah look at me dress it up with spicy  pickled veggies and bammy whammy all  that's left to do is to dig in oh it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,3467280,3472880,still plenty hot yeah i'm one yes  look at that it's a whole tuna steak  there's a little different textures all
NTLifuwI7Dg,3472880,3478640,over this thing some parts are really  crisped up and some are a little bit  more steamy
NTLifuwI7Dg,3479520,3486319,it's all crunchy medium the skin and all  the outside here has just been  completely coated and lined with  seasoning so it's warm it's savory it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,3486319,3492000,salty oh my lord all right i'm ripping  off this tail piece obviously it's a lot  more narrow so probably cooked a lot
NTLifuwI7Dg,3492000,3497599,faster and you can see a beautiful crisp  right here  [Music]  super crispy the teal usually have a
NTLifuwI7Dg,3497599,3503680,little darker note to it than the white  meat of the belly especially with the  tuna here's what i'm really curious  about did the body cook all the way
NTLifuwI7Dg,3503680,3510319,through  i'm pulling out of this whole big slice  yeah  so that is almost all the way cooked
NTLifuwI7Dg,3510319,3517040,through some sashimi in the middle here  and then just right nearby some nice  fried tuna
NTLifuwI7Dg,3517040,3523760,very tender there's so many experiences  in one fish the head there's a lot of  treasured parts in here first is the  cheek i've been told by many fish head
NTLifuwI7Dg,3523760,3530559,lovers that this is the best bite  the whole tuna right here it is super  fatty mixed with protein and then a nice
NTLifuwI7Dg,3530559,3536880,crunchy exterior here  oh yeah a lot more fatty i feel it in  your fingers right
NTLifuwI7Dg,3536880,3542880,but the whole head there was so much  meat and so many different holes and  crevices and places where you could  reach in and grab meat and pull it out
NTLifuwI7Dg,3542880,3549040,tuna tongue is that a delicacy not that  popular i'm gonna put that  there  so this is the top of the head yeah i'm
NTLifuwI7Dg,3549040,3555440,on an insane amount of meat on here you  can see even the grain the way the meat  is growing here gorgeous oh look at just
NTLifuwI7Dg,3555440,3562798,like the tenderloin this is the backup  with some crunch on it try some of that  i would love that thank you my friend
NTLifuwI7Dg,3564799,3569839,this is one of the most unique seafood  experiences i've ever had i mean anybody  can fry a fish or fry a tuna but when
NTLifuwI7Dg,3569839,3575520,it's at this scale you can see the  difference from the head for the tail  from a little bit of sashimi inside that  may not have been intentional
NTLifuwI7Dg,3575520,3580720,compliments to the chef he ordered  himself creating this masterpiece and  the size alone sonic you know when you
NTLifuwI7Dg,3580720,3587040,come to jamaica size matters  our final chapter brings back an element
NTLifuwI7Dg,3587040,3593920,of danger no not the puffer fish this  would be even worse it's peeing it goes  right to your neural tub it's a bad deer
NTLifuwI7Dg,3593920,3599250,that was really bad this danger of the  deep is waiting for me here
NTLifuwI7Dg,3599250,3605680,[Music]  safiron is a family-owned business we've  been here 35 years you come here you
NTLifuwI7Dg,3605680,3611200,feel like you're on a boat and you're  getting fresh seafood straight from the  caribbean sea locals come tourists come
NTLifuwI7Dg,3611200,3617440,every animal in the jungle kind of comes  homestead one reading us today jason  owner of pier one what are some of the
NTLifuwI7Dg,3617440,3623520,more popular seafood in jamaica well  lobsters are always number one and the  red snapper is a close second of course
NTLifuwI7Dg,3623520,3628640,now we're gonna try something today  that's a little bit different so we're  trying something that's not really
NTLifuwI7Dg,3628640,3634319,native to this area no no this is the  lionfish yes  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,3634319,3640559,coming from the tropical waters of the  south pacific and indian oceans this  beauty is the star of many aquariums but
NTLifuwI7Dg,3640559,3645759,around florida and the caribbean it's an  absolute terror
NTLifuwI7Dg,3646000,3651839,the lionfish is believed to have escaped  or even more likely to have been  released into florida waters from an
NTLifuwI7Dg,3651839,3658079,aquarium over two decades ago they're  very aggressive and they feed on young  fish on the reef and once they come up
NTLifuwI7Dg,3658079,3663680,the reef is basically dead in an effort  to reduce the number of lionfish the  jamaican government encourages its
NTLifuwI7Dg,3663680,3669440,consumption well it's very difficult to  catch you have to handle them with a lot  of caution because even dead even in
NTLifuwI7Dg,3669440,3675119,this state if one of those barbs were to  stick you you would be in for a bad  night 20 minutes for the puffer fish
NTLifuwI7Dg,3675119,3681119,yeah this would be even worse it's pain  it goes right to your neurotox it's a  body all right i'm going to gently put
NTLifuwI7Dg,3681119,3687680,the plate down behind you and just don't  back up too much  despite its bad reputation when it comes
NTLifuwI7Dg,3687680,3694480,to flavor this bad boy is highly rated  among seafood lovers  but before you dig in you must carefully
NTLifuwI7Dg,3694480,3702480,remove the fish's venomous spikes it  cooks anyway it's a nice fish it can be  escovich fried steamed roasted what
NTLifuwI7Dg,3702480,3707599,should we do today let's do a nice  steamed fish next score the fish and  season it with salt and pepper then
NTLifuwI7Dg,3707599,3713440,stuff some thyme onion garlic and scotch  bonnet into its nooks and crannies  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,3713440,3719520,heat it in a pan with olive oil sprinkle  some bell pepper and scallions on top
NTLifuwI7Dg,3720000,3725880,pour in a cup of water and let it steam  until it's ready to eat
NTLifuwI7Dg,3728400,3734400,let's take a little tour of the plate it  looks like we've got some pressed  plantains that have been fried and  what's this this is rice and peas rice
NTLifuwI7Dg,3734400,3741280,and peas is everywhere throughout  jamaica it's one of our most loved  dishes some people cook it with coconut  milk and it has fresh herbs and spices
NTLifuwI7Dg,3741280,3747520,in there oh it's very flavorful i love  it this is broccoli do we need to  discuss i don't even want to see that  all right here it is the lionfish it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,3747520,3754160,in the shape of the fish without all its  fancy weapons yeah they had to snip all  of that off so we can actually consume  it where your needles down [ __ ] right
NTLifuwI7Dg,3754160,3759839,come on it is still pretty bony that's a  flop remember how we got piece of the  cheek from the tuna this has meat under
NTLifuwI7Dg,3759839,3768760,there that should be right under there  as well so in the fin pit there's a nice  big beautiful chunk of white oily meat
NTLifuwI7Dg,3771039,3777359,only hard part about this the discerning  flavor of the fish and the flavors that  they've added on here which are quite  delicious it's like a thick salty savory
NTLifuwI7Dg,3777359,3782640,gravy it's one of my favorite fish in  the past 10 years they've taken over the  reefs but since then i've learned to
NTLifuwI7Dg,3782640,3788960,love it and i absolutely can't get  enough of it how do you think we can get  more people to jump in on this by  watching your video okay
NTLifuwI7Dg,3788960,3794720,hear the body this is gorgeous look at  this mean it's so soft tender it's juicy  but it's not like mushy no it still
NTLifuwI7Dg,3794720,3801520,holds firm  oh the taste is so good the flakiness  and the meatiness of this is similar to
NTLifuwI7Dg,3801520,3806960,pirate a lot of people in jamaica eat  parrot fish which helps to build a reef  i mean it eats a reef and it passes sand
NTLifuwI7Dg,3806960,3812319,so it helps with the reef building these  just eat the reef so what we're trying  to do is also get people to stop eating
NTLifuwI7Dg,3812319,3817920,as much pirate fish and eat more  lionfish if this fish became extremely  popular demand would go super high
NTLifuwI7Dg,3817920,3823039,supply would go low prices would go up  wait is that good hold on what's my  point ah demand would go up supply would
NTLifuwI7Dg,3823039,3829119,go down prices would go up people would  be more motivated to go out and catch  these kind of fish because they know  they're gonna make big money off it
NTLifuwI7Dg,3829119,3834799,they're like why would i get two and a  half or some of these species that are  going near extinction everybody we have  to work together on this one if you can
NTLifuwI7Dg,3834799,3841440,all dial right now one eight hundred eat  lions it's not a real phone number i  don't know i was just on a roll
NTLifuwI7Dg,3841599,3846880,oh i've got yeah that's very good you  better eat it  what a beautiful day

NTLifuwI7Dg,3894960,3901280,here it's made with curry powder garlic  lentils and sauteed garlic that simmer  down over time what kind of spices in
NTLifuwI7Dg,3901280,3908000,here curry powder pepper onion green  pepper oh it's like a delicious split  pea gravy but i gotta say that's
NTLifuwI7Dg,3908000,3914240,different than any doll i've had in  india it's lacking about 14 spices it's  not exactly the same as when i have  curry and indium there's just so many
NTLifuwI7Dg,3914240,3920000,seasonings so many different spices and  this is a little bit more tamed down  version this indian signature gets mixed
NTLifuwI7Dg,3920000,3925599,with saltfish a jamaican staple that  makes its way into several local dishes  why do you guys eat so much salted
NTLifuwI7Dg,3925599,3931760,preserved fish if the fish are just  right out there it really dates back in  history when ships used to transport
NTLifuwI7Dg,3931760,3938160,people to jamaica during the slave trade  the saltfish was a big part of that  transport they needed something that was  preserved right it seems now like it's
NTLifuwI7Dg,3938160,3944559,almost just a seasoning yeah  it gets hydrated char grilled then  scraped off before it's mixed with
NTLifuwI7Dg,3944559,3951440,sauteed onions garlic and scotch bonnet  peppers  oh wow that's super salty
NTLifuwI7Dg,3951440,3956799,it adds volume but adds some seasoning  too to what you're eating you know what  happened this is drinking food oh okay

NTLifuwI7Dg,3985200,3993039,ghost out to here kept on waking her up  this poor goat
NTLifuwI7Dg,3993039,3999760,raja's grandparents were among the first  indians arriving in jamaica in the early  1900s cuisine in jamaica it's a mix of a
NTLifuwI7Dg,3999760,4006400,lot of different places including india  definitely including india i mean curry  is a huge part of
NTLifuwI7Dg,4006810,4011839,[Music]  indo-jamaican cooking is just one facet
NTLifuwI7Dg,4011839,4017359,of the diverse diaspora that's  influenced food on this island as an  indian jamaican growing up i know
NTLifuwI7Dg,4017359,4023599,there's plenty of indian people here but  you're not the majority was it different  at all being indian or you're just  another jamaican just like another
NTLifuwI7Dg,4023599,4028800,jamaican some people would say wait  you're not jamaican but that's not that  common

NTLifuwI7Dg,4319120,4324560,okay  this honestly looks magical it's  beautiful it's hard to believe that just
NTLifuwI7Dg,4324560,4330640,a few hours ago this was a gorgeous  looking uh live creature the meat looks  outstanding the soup this is where we're
NTLifuwI7Dg,4330640,4335679,gonna start it's called manishwata what  is going on
NTLifuwI7Dg,4336159,4341600,manishwata is the goat belly and all the  other pots that you think you would  throw out of the soup it's in here the
NTLifuwI7Dg,4341600,4349760,intestines  face meat goat feet and even the goat's  penis all is hidden inside
NTLifuwI7Dg,4350080,4357199,first cook this random assortment of  proteins along with onions scallions and  scotch bonnet pepper add diced pumpkin
NTLifuwI7Dg,4357199,4363440,and allow it to cook down a bit  so what does managed water mean  basically comes from way back because
NTLifuwI7Dg,4363440,4369280,many men used to prepare it but it also  says that it have a little aphrodisiac  it gives you a little punch and it makes
NTLifuwI7Dg,4369280,4374560,you stand up for more than upon your  feet  [Laughter]  next prep green bananas with the peels
NTLifuwI7Dg,4374560,4380530,still intact then carrots potatoes and  yellow yams before adding it to the  final pot
NTLifuwI7Dg,4380530,4386960,[Music]  oh the soup's good did you use pumpkin
NTLifuwI7Dg,4386960,4392000,or squash to create the base for the  soup yes because it has a beautiful  starchy base to it so it's kind of thick
NTLifuwI7Dg,4392000,4397840,and it also adds that color to it  what time that is green banana with the  skin on oh
NTLifuwI7Dg,4397840,4404000,that's a loud yeah mine  it's soft and a little crunchy
NTLifuwI7Dg,4404000,4409199,wow i've never eaten the banana peel  before that's awesome right yeah it  tastes good just real starchy gives it a
NTLifuwI7Dg,4409199,4414480,different texture to the soup and then  am i going to be able to figure out what  part is what part yeah really what's
NTLifuwI7Dg,4414480,4420239,that that's the head how you know that  or maybe  one of the
NTLifuwI7Dg,4420239,4426880,foot  and i think it's ed but you think  [Music]
NTLifuwI7Dg,4426880,4432239,so it's definitely the foot i can taste  the char on it because they charred it  they scraped off all the time
NTLifuwI7Dg,4432239,4438080,all right that is the sweetest spot they  call that the rug the rug look like a  rock it's my favorite part i like it
