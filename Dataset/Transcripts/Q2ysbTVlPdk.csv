Q2ysbTVlPdk,90,3189,"- I'm Dr. Ugo Iroku, a board certified gastroenterologist"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,3190,5150,and digestive disease specialist.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,5150,7520,"Today, I'll be answering your questions from Twitter."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,7520,9293,This is Gut Support.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,14090,15990,"Queerrepublican, how long is a small"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,15990,17660,and large intestine
Q2ysbTVlPdk,17660,20330,'cause that's how many feet per second food moves
Q2ysbTVlPdk,20330,21550,through my body?
Q2ysbTVlPdk,21550,25230,So the small intestine is about 18 feet long.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,25230,27300,The large intestine is about six feet long.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,27300,29269,Oftentimes people will eat food
Q2ysbTVlPdk,29270,31420,"and feel like it's running straight through their body,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,31420,32252,but it turns out
Q2ysbTVlPdk,32252,36180,that there is a process called the gastrocolic reflex.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,36180,37630,That's probably accounting
Q2ysbTVlPdk,37630,40800,"for that immediate bowel movement you have, what is that?"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,40800,43780,It's when your stomach senses that there's food coming in
Q2ysbTVlPdk,43780,45910,and wants to create space in the body.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,45910,48239,"So it tells the colon, move things along"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,48240,50220,through the process of peristalsis.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,50220,53160,It relaxes the muscles at the bottom of your anus
Q2ysbTVlPdk,53160,54300,and you are able to poop.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,54300,55840,And so the poop you're pooping out
Q2ysbTVlPdk,55840,57360,is not the food you just ate.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,57360,59560,It typically takes about two to three days
Q2ysbTVlPdk,59560,62630,for you to eat a food and actually have it leave your body.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,62630,63688,You should know that.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,63688,68140,"@kingofkgn, aren't we all a little lactose intolerant?"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,68140,71360,"The answer king is no, just you, but just kidding."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,71360,74800,A lot of us become lactose intolerant over a time.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,74800,78060,The whole concept is that we are all born typically
Q2ysbTVlPdk,78060,79729,with enzymes called lactase
Q2ysbTVlPdk,79730,81750,that help us digest breast milk.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,81750,83760,"And so as we get older,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,83760,86970,oftentimes many people in the population lose their ability
Q2ysbTVlPdk,86970,88490,to break down that dairy.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,88490,91600,"It happens more commonly in African American communities,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,91600,93100,"American Indian communities,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,93100,94979,"Asian communities, Latino communities"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,94980,97650,and that makes us more intolerant to dairy.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,97650,101360,"Daleicious98, my poop is dark green"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,101360,103840,"like the color of spinach, am I dying?"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,103840,107479,The color of poop starts off as being green for everybody.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,107480,110100,"And that's just the color of the pigment, bile."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,110100,113110,As bile makes its way through your digestive tract
Q2ysbTVlPdk,113110,115290,"it's oxidized, it's digested."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,115290,116470,By the time it comes out
Q2ysbTVlPdk,116470,119020,it's the poop that you normally come to no one love
Q2ysbTVlPdk,119020,120100,of a brown color.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,120100,123650,The green color in poop is not a sign of anything dangerous
Q2ysbTVlPdk,123650,125850,but that green it's all coming from you.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,125850,128640,You're probably just having a faster motility movement
Q2ysbTVlPdk,128640,129960,of the poop through your body
Q2ysbTVlPdk,129960,132480,that's letting you still be able to see that green color
Q2ysbTVlPdk,132480,134519,that you normally wouldn't see.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,134520,136500,"2BoopsAndAToot, this person needs"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,136500,138060,a gastroenterologist badly.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,138060,140410,"If you hold all your farts in,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,140410,142930,do you start floating away like a balloon?
Q2ysbTVlPdk,142930,145430,Obviously the answer is no.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,145430,148269,If you were to hold all your farts in
Q2ysbTVlPdk,148270,150460,you would be a very uncomfortable person.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,150460,154680,There would be a high likelihood of gas incontinence.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,154680,158000,So likelihood that you would indeed let one rip
Q2ysbTVlPdk,158000,159940,at some point with some movement.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,159940,161160,"But after a while,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,161160,164170,gas being gas just finds a way to dissipate
Q2ysbTVlPdk,164170,166640,from one area and go to another area.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,166640,168750,If it finds it's not able to go out through the anus
Q2ysbTVlPdk,168750,172090,"like it usually can, it'll dissipate into your body"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,172090,174950,"and find its way excreted out your body,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,174950,176650,perhaps through your respiratory system
Q2ysbTVlPdk,176650,177810,or through another method.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,177810,178819,So to make the distinction
Q2ysbTVlPdk,178820,179960,"between the anus and the sphincter,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,179960,182200,I can show you on our little diagram here.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,182200,185530,The anus pretty much refers to this entire area
Q2ysbTVlPdk,185530,190010,that includes a number of supportive tissue and muscles.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,190010,193110,It's the thing right at the end of your digestive system.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,193110,194700,"Now, as part of your anus,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,194700,197440,you have sphincters external internal
Q2ysbTVlPdk,197440,199880,that help to tighten the bottom of your anus
Q2ysbTVlPdk,199880,201750,to make sure that nothing escapes.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,201750,204790,So pretty much the sphincter are those muscles that exist
Q2ysbTVlPdk,204790,208469,within the anus to help prevent incontinence
Q2ysbTVlPdk,208470,211060,"of gas, liquids, or solids."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,211060,212900,And what is incontinence doctor?
Q2ysbTVlPdk,212900,215239,Incontinence just means that you're letting things rip
Q2ysbTVlPdk,215240,216700,without intending to.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,216700,218950,"Sometimes people have gas incontinence,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,218950,220950,"they're passing gas without meaning to,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,220950,223489,or they could actually have poop incontinent
Q2ysbTVlPdk,223490,226620,where actually having bowel movements at moments
Q2ysbTVlPdk,226620,229670,"you just didn't plan on having those, not fun."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,229670,232530,"TwinCitiesChick, how long does it take"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,232530,233780,for you to get food poisoning
Q2ysbTVlPdk,233780,236230,after having eaten something suspect?
Q2ysbTVlPdk,236230,239840,"Asking for a friend, okay, no, that's bull."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,239840,243640,"I'm asking for myself, concerned emoji face."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,243640,245010,And so it turns out that
Q2ysbTVlPdk,245010,247470,"when you eat something that makes you sick,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,247470,249170,we call that food poisoning.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,249170,250980,It can happen pretty quickly.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,250980,253739,Within an hour you can have toxins that have been formed
Q2ysbTVlPdk,253740,256120,by the bacteria affecting your gut.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,256120,260160,Bacteria like Bacillus found in items like fried foods
Q2ysbTVlPdk,260160,264520,or Clostridium found in dented cans that can have toxins
Q2ysbTVlPdk,264520,266470,"that are infiltrated in the food,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,266470,268560,can make you sick again within an hour or two.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,268560,270610,There's some that take a couple of days to develop
Q2ysbTVlPdk,270610,272349,but you might be running for the toilet bowl
Q2ysbTVlPdk,272350,274450,even before you're done with your plate.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,274450,277290,"SimplyThinkingg, what is a gastroenterologist"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,277290,279130,and why do commercials talk about them
Q2ysbTVlPdk,279130,280540,like we should all have one?
Q2ysbTVlPdk,280540,282220,So a gastroenterologist is a physician
Q2ysbTVlPdk,282220,284370,who spent six years after med school training
Q2ysbTVlPdk,284370,286070,on digestive disease health.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,286070,288340,Oftentimes you need to see us for many reasons.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,288340,291270,20 million Americans have chronic gastrointestinal diseases
Q2ysbTVlPdk,291270,292930,like IBS or IBD.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,292930,294889,One of the most common procedures that we do
Q2ysbTVlPdk,294890,297190,as gastroenterologists is the colonoscope.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,297190,298690,And this is where we look with the camera
Q2ysbTVlPdk,298690,302160,into your colon and look for any signs of any disease
Q2ysbTVlPdk,302160,303930,or polyps that need to be removed.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,303930,305729,"And just in case, you're feeling comfortable,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,305730,307790,I'm gonna show you exactly what we do
Q2ysbTVlPdk,307790,309100,during your colonoscope.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,309100,313750,So what I have here is one of our inter scopes
Q2ysbTVlPdk,313750,315230,and particularly this is designed to look
Q2ysbTVlPdk,315230,317610,into your upper abdomen
Q2ysbTVlPdk,317610,320020,but a similar process we use for colonoscope.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,320020,323910,So it has a couple of dials that allows me to drive
Q2ysbTVlPdk,324790,327750,the scope as it makes its way through your intestines.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,327750,330230,It has a light source that lets me have a good look
Q2ysbTVlPdk,330230,333260,and look to look for polyps or any sign of disease.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,333260,335180,It has a few channels through the scope
Q2ysbTVlPdk,335180,338810,that allows me to take samples with the biopsy forceps.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,338810,341930,And it also has clips that let me stop bleeding
Q2ysbTVlPdk,341930,345449,or cauterized and burn any bleeding sites if necessary.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,345450,348070,"Next up, Mucosal Immunology,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,348070,350720,are there really 10 times more bacteria
Q2ysbTVlPdk,350720,352250,than cells in our body.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,352250,356320,"Mucosal, if I can call you that, the answer is probably not."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,356320,357820,The 10 times number comes
Q2ysbTVlPdk,357820,361970,from earlier on in our examination of the microbiome.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,361970,364580,"So the collection of bacteria, viruses,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,364580,366419,and fungi that exist in our gut
Q2ysbTVlPdk,366420,367840,and the estimation at the time was that
Q2ysbTVlPdk,367840,371270,there was 10 times more microbiota
Q2ysbTVlPdk,371270,373750,than there were actually human cells.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,373750,375980,That number has been revised recently
Q2ysbTVlPdk,375980,378200,especially when you're just looking at bacteria.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,378200,381570,It's thought to be more that for every one human cell
Q2ysbTVlPdk,381570,384950,"you have about 1.3 bacterial cells, but still"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,384950,386910,"if your body were democracy,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,386910,388860,you might be voted out of power.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,388860,393759,"Rafael Tiriel, okay, who needs a fecal transplant?"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,393760,395080,"Rafael, we just met."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,395080,396699,"First of all, what we call it"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,396700,399180,is a fecal microbiota transplant.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,399180,402509,"And what that means is yes, we are taking fecal content"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,402510,405620,"from person A and putting it in person B,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,405620,407530,but this is not something most of you need
Q2ysbTVlPdk,407530,409580,which is a good thing for you to hear.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,409580,411979,It's typically used for people who have a very
Q2ysbTVlPdk,411980,414950,severely damaged environment in their colon.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,414950,418230,One situation is people who have C difficile colitis
Q2ysbTVlPdk,418230,420540,where their gut has pretty much been overrun
Q2ysbTVlPdk,420540,422420,by this bacteria called C difficile.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,422420,423460,And so in those cases
Q2ysbTVlPdk,423460,426069,we have to transport a whole new population
Q2ysbTVlPdk,426070,429900,of healthy bacteria from a healthy person into their gut.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,429900,432440,There are many ways we put it in through a colonoscope
Q2ysbTVlPdk,432440,434960,or sometimes through a nasal gastric tube
Q2ysbTVlPdk,434960,437460,"but one way or the other, we get that healthy poop"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,437460,439770,into the colon to help it feeling better.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,439770,440930,"Just to let you know, again"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,440930,442987,there's this whole thing called the gut microbiome.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,442987,445880,And so we're not just transferring poop for poop sake.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,445880,449410,We're transferring a healthy community of healthy bacteria
Q2ysbTVlPdk,449410,450720,from one person to the other.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,450720,453100,We have this entire amazing universe
Q2ysbTVlPdk,453100,455900,"that exists inside of us that can keep us healthy,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,455900,458400,and some people need a little help from their friends
Q2ysbTVlPdk,458400,460220,to get through some situations.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,460220,462520,"Fran Drescher, could there be a connection"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,462520,465830,between your gut microbiome and Alzheimer's?
Q2ysbTVlPdk,465830,467659,"That's a great question, Fran."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,467660,469920,It's one that we're closely looking into.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,469920,472530,What we do know is that a healthy gut microbiome
Q2ysbTVlPdk,472530,475320,produces nutrients that are important for a healthy brain.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,475320,478480,"Omega threes, polyphenols are all very important"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,478480,482160,for proper neuron formation and function in your brain.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,482160,484410,And so it's very possible that having
Q2ysbTVlPdk,484410,488070,a very healthy gut leads to a very healthy thought process.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,488070,490360,"In terms of how to actually make that work,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,490360,492069,"what to do about that information,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,492070,494480,that we're still working on the answer to.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,494480,498860,"KemiAde, the worsting about being a woman, bloating."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,498860,502680,"Why must the air in my stomach feel like 10,000 knives?"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,502680,505650,Women frequently can have hormonal effects
Q2ysbTVlPdk,505650,506800,"that come from the uterus,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,506800,510069,come from the ovary and affect the gut dynamics.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,510070,512880,And so sometimes you have aspects of the gut
Q2ysbTVlPdk,512880,515580,that are not relaxing the way they should
Q2ysbTVlPdk,515580,518110,or that are not moving your bowels
Q2ysbTVlPdk,518110,519229,along the way they should.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,519229,522070,There are many medical definitions of the word bloating
Q2ysbTVlPdk,522070,524910,"but typically to be honest, we do tend to use that"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,524910,526720,as a description of the symptom.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,526720,529930,"When it comes to what the underlying problem is,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,529930,531410,"it could be constipation,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,531410,534430,"it could be diarrhea, it could be gastritis."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,534430,535790,What can you do about it?
Q2ysbTVlPdk,535790,538500,Modify your diet so that you can tolerate those times
Q2ysbTVlPdk,538500,539790,of the month a little better.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,539790,542050,There are many conditions that can have the symptom
Q2ysbTVlPdk,542050,543839,of bloating and cause people to feel
Q2ysbTVlPdk,543840,545850,like they're having a thousand knives shooting
Q2ysbTVlPdk,545850,546959,through their guts.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,546960,551180,"All right, Angry Angry Alice asks, what is constipation"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,551180,553420,if not clogged farteries?
Q2ysbTVlPdk,553420,554456,"All right, Alice,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,554456,557520,you're creating a whole new terminology here.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,557520,560460,Constipation is essentially when your bowels
Q2ysbTVlPdk,560460,563440,are not empty out as routinely as they should
Q2ysbTVlPdk,563440,564770,in a way that they should.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,564770,567140,And so there's this component of frequency
Q2ysbTVlPdk,567140,570620,and then there's this component of a subjective description
Q2ysbTVlPdk,570620,572730,of how your bowel widths are and how you feel with it.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,572730,574130,So you should be moving your bowels
Q2ysbTVlPdk,574130,575930,at least three times a week.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,575930,579330,Anything less than that is formally constipation.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,579330,582120,"If you started off, however, is moving your bowels daily"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,582120,585670,"and then you drop down to four times a week,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,585670,587139,"that might be constipation for you,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,587140,589010,that change in bowel movements.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,589010,593150,"RSB90, I know bananas are a good prebiotic,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,593150,594360,but what else is?
Q2ysbTVlPdk,594360,597269,I've started on probiotic tablets for gut health.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,597270,600840,So probiotics are bacteria that exist
Q2ysbTVlPdk,600840,603750,that we intentionally sometimes consume.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,603750,605820,They come in pill form with a concept
Q2ysbTVlPdk,605820,608090,of trying to put healthy bacteria into our body.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,608090,610480,I will say that not everyone needs to take probiotics.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,610480,612240,If you have a healthy diverse diet
Q2ysbTVlPdk,612240,614560,that could actually give you the probiotics you need
Q2ysbTVlPdk,614560,616480,just from your consumption alone.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,616480,620579,So if you're having your kimchi and kombucha and yogurts
Q2ysbTVlPdk,620580,621650,that may be all you need.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,621650,624250,"Probiotics essentially eat prebiotics,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,624250,625640,and what are prebiotics.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,625640,627950,"In short hand, those are essentially fibers."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,627950,630470,They're things that probiotics like to eat
Q2ysbTVlPdk,630470,632110,so that they can increase in number.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,632110,634700,A healthy diverse diet will contain all the pre
Q2ysbTVlPdk,634700,637740,and probiotics you need to be healthy yourself.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,637740,639540,"Cookie4youandme, that's nice."
Q2ysbTVlPdk,639540,642009,"My poop is black, am I dying?"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,642010,643030,"Cookie, I hope not,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,643030,644830,"and odds are you're not dying,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,644830,648240,but yes black stool can be very important.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,648240,649750,What Cookie's referring to is the fact
Q2ysbTVlPdk,649750,653040,that black stool often refers to blood in the stool.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,653040,655000,Blood of course starts off as being red.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,655000,657180,By the time it goes to the digestive process
Q2ysbTVlPdk,657180,659230,and gets all the way down to the toilet bowl.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,659230,661730,It's often seen as being black and tarry.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,661730,664110,"And so if you notice that change in your bowel movements,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,664110,665170,that might mean that you have
Q2ysbTVlPdk,665170,667136,an important gastrointestinal bleed going on.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,667137,669230,"Other reason for having black poop,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,669230,670480,it might be food coloring.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,670480,671649,It might be licorice.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,671650,673050,It might be Pepto Bismol
Q2ysbTVlPdk,673050,674899,but typically it's not something you wanna see.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,674900,676830,And if you have that very important
Q2ysbTVlPdk,676830,679650,to talk to your doctor about.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,679650,683650,"Ean Hammond ask, why does coffee make me poop?"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,683650,686010,"All right, we know not to hang around you"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,686010,687400,right after your cup Java.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,687400,689830,There are many reasons why coffee might be making you poop.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,689830,692230,One of them is that coffee in general
Q2ysbTVlPdk,692230,694370,can cause peristalsis in the colon.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,694370,695980,So that's that P word again.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,695980,698250,It just means it makes your colon moves a poop.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,698250,700090,Another thing that coffee can sometimes do
Q2ysbTVlPdk,700090,702690,through caffeine is relax the anal sphincter
Q2ysbTVlPdk,702690,704970,making poop more ready to come out of your body.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,704970,707089,And sometimes it's just having a warm liquid
Q2ysbTVlPdk,707090,709930,"and the routine of it all, something entering your stomach"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,709930,711460,that really more than anything else
Q2ysbTVlPdk,711460,714660,is just a trigger of that gastrocolic reflux
Q2ysbTVlPdk,714660,716259,for things to start moving along.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,716260,720820,"Connorleary64, does my IBS cause my anxiety"

Q2ysbTVlPdk,729330,731760,"So for the uninitiated, the lucky ones"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,731760,733110,of those of you who are
Q2ysbTVlPdk,733110,735820,IBS stands for irritable bowel syndrome.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,735820,739030,It really just means that your gut is irritated
Q2ysbTVlPdk,739030,742430,and hyperactive and very sensitive to any amount
Q2ysbTVlPdk,742430,745460,"of distension in your gut causing a lot of pain,"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,745460,748360,a lot of gassiness and either a lot of pooping
Q2ysbTVlPdk,748360,750700,or a decreased amount of bowel movements.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,750700,753120,Your IBS does cause your anxiety
Q2ysbTVlPdk,753120,756750,often in the form of a person having severe symptoms
Q2ysbTVlPdk,756750,758290,and not having a clear answer
Q2ysbTVlPdk,758290,759810,as to why they're having symptoms.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,759810,762570,"Additionally, we do find that people who have anxiety"
Q2ysbTVlPdk,762570,764960,or depression have a higher likelihood
Q2ysbTVlPdk,764960,766450,of having irritable bowel syndrome.

Q2ysbTVlPdk,775050,777040,and that's the word that just keeps coming up
Q2ysbTVlPdk,777040,778699,that's intimately involved
Q2ysbTVlPdk,778700,781020,in the function of our immune system.
Q2ysbTVlPdk,781020,783200,It's important to note that your immune system
Q2ysbTVlPdk,783200,786880,70% of it exists within your digestive health tract.
