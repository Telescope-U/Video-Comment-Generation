NnfrYz2MU7o,0,1680,hey folks if you missed the kickstarter
NnfrYz2MU7o,1680,4160,and want to pre-order flea mortals the
NnfrYz2MU7o,4160,6879,mcdm monster book pre-orders are open we
NnfrYz2MU7o,6879,8480,also have a channel in our discord for
NnfrYz2MU7o,8480,9599,talking about the monsters we've
NnfrYz2MU7o,9599,11679,released so far and there are more
NnfrYz2MU7o,11679,13599,monsters coming soon a link in the
NnfrYz2MU7o,13599,16000,doobly-doo on with the show this is one
NnfrYz2MU7o,16000,17119,of those videos that has a couple of
NnfrYz2MU7o,17119,18160,lessons in it i think you could
NnfrYz2MU7o,18160,20480,basically use this video to run your own
NnfrYz2MU7o,20480,22400,dusk adventure but i couldn't figure out
NnfrYz2MU7o,22400,23920,how to turn each of these lessons into
NnfrYz2MU7o,23920,25840,their own videos so there's a bunch of
NnfrYz2MU7o,25840,28240,advice in here that usually means fewer
NnfrYz2MU7o,28240,30080,people watch it which you know that that
NnfrYz2MU7o,30080,31679,makes me sad because i put a lot of work
NnfrYz2MU7o,31679,33920,into this stuff but i see it as my role
NnfrYz2MU7o,33920,35680,to teach what i've learned and if some
NnfrYz2MU7o,35680,37920,lessons are complex and they don't boil
NnfrYz2MU7o,37920,39680,down easily into a video with a clear
NnfrYz2MU7o,39680,41760,thesis and a clever title
NnfrYz2MU7o,41760,43440,i know some people will still get use
NnfrYz2MU7o,43440,46079,out of it anyway you get it i think the
NnfrYz2MU7o,46079,47200,first part of this video could have been
NnfrYz2MU7o,47200,49440,called too many villagers hair mozart
NnfrYz2MU7o,49440,52239,how shall one say director
NnfrYz2MU7o,52239,54719,too many notes your majesty exactly very
NnfrYz2MU7o,54719,56960,well put too many notes so if you don't
NnfrYz2MU7o,56960,59120,know what dusk is it's a campaign i ran
NnfrYz2MU7o,59120,60800,last year for my friends you can watch
NnfrYz2MU7o,60800,61840,the whole thing right here on this
NnfrYz2MU7o,61840,64239,channel playlist here the idea was very
NnfrYz2MU7o,64239,66080,simple and straightforward and that was
NnfrYz2MU7o,66080,68400,the power of it step one find the
NnfrYz2MU7o,68400,70240,missing villagers a whole town full of
NnfrYz2MU7o,70240,72320,them they are in the forest somewhere
NnfrYz2MU7o,72320,73600,they live up in the north and there's a
NnfrYz2MU7o,73600,75119,lot of strife up there so they decided
NnfrYz2MU7o,75119,77200,to brave the elf haunted forest to the
NnfrYz2MU7o,77200,79439,south and make for literally greener
NnfrYz2MU7o,79439,81439,pastures there used to be a road through
NnfrYz2MU7o,81439,83119,the forest so the villagers think how
NnfrYz2MU7o,83119,84479,hard can it be
NnfrYz2MU7o,84479,86320,that's the setup find the missing
NnfrYz2MU7o,86320,88080,caravan and originally i thought that
NnfrYz2MU7o,88080,89439,would be the whole thing i didn't think
NnfrYz2MU7o,89439,91759,it was a campaign i just wanted to show
NnfrYz2MU7o,91759,93840,off fourth edition 4e was a lot of fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,93840,95840,it had a ton of cool features it was a
NnfrYz2MU7o,95840,98320,very forward-looking product and the
NnfrYz2MU7o,98320,100159,players loved it a couple of them asked
NnfrYz2MU7o,100159,102880,can we just run the chain of akron in 4e
NnfrYz2MU7o,102880,105280,yep i don't i don't know no not not
NnfrYz2MU7o,105280,107600,right now but maybe later like after the
NnfrYz2MU7o,107600,109759,heist we'll see so for the entire first
NnfrYz2MU7o,109759,111680,part of the campaign there were no
NnfrYz2MU7o,111680,113360,villagers to worry about i figured the
NnfrYz2MU7o,113360,114960,game would end when they found the
NnfrYz2MU7o,114960,117759,missing villagers this was just a a demo
NnfrYz2MU7o,117759,119280,an excuse to throw a bunch of fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,119280,120960,encounters at the players which meant it
NnfrYz2MU7o,120960,122960,was also very easy to prep mostly what i
NnfrYz2MU7o,122960,125280,did was scrub through a few fantasy map
NnfrYz2MU7o,125280,127119,patreons links in the doobly-doo and
NnfrYz2MU7o,127119,129200,when i saw a map that inspired me well
NnfrYz2MU7o,129200,131599,that was the next encounter that process
NnfrYz2MU7o,131599,134400,find a cool enchanted forest map build
NnfrYz2MU7o,134400,136800,and encounter for it was easy and fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,136800,138400,for me i could prep an entire session in
NnfrYz2MU7o,138400,140000,just a couple of hours before we played
NnfrYz2MU7o,140000,142319,which compared to the chain of akron was
NnfrYz2MU7o,142319,145040,like paradise one thing i did which i
NnfrYz2MU7o,145040,146239,don't think would have worked anywhere
NnfrYz2MU7o,146239,147760,near as well if we were playing in
NnfrYz2MU7o,147760,149680,person was one session i just put a
NnfrYz2MU7o,149680,152239,gigantic tactical map in front of them i
NnfrYz2MU7o,152239,154080,dropped them on the edge of this huge
NnfrYz2MU7o,154080,157760,forest map and i said okay go ahead we
NnfrYz2MU7o,157760,159120,were using fantasy grounds which has
NnfrYz2MU7o,159120,160879,dynamic lighting and i dropped a bunch
NnfrYz2MU7o,160879,162879,of encounters around it was really cool
NnfrYz2MU7o,162879,164720,it was a knight and od's character
NnfrYz2MU7o,164720,166080,doesn't have dark vision so when the
NnfrYz2MU7o,166080,168480,player with the light walked away matt
NnfrYz2MU7o,168480,170560,was literally plunged into darkness his
NnfrYz2MU7o,170560,172640,entire map turned totally black with
NnfrYz2MU7o,172640,174879,just his icon there floating in space
NnfrYz2MU7o,174879,176640,and you could hear him yell
NnfrYz2MU7o,176640,178159,this was awesome and letting them
NnfrYz2MU7o,178159,179760,literally just walk around on the map
NnfrYz2MU7o,179760,181680,and explore on their own go in different
NnfrYz2MU7o,181680,183599,directions until eventually one or two
NnfrYz2MU7o,183599,185920,of them ran into a threat was something
NnfrYz2MU7o,185920,187680,i don't even know how i would do at the
NnfrYz2MU7o,187680,189200,table so that's a little something if
NnfrYz2MU7o,189200,191440,you're using a vtt feel free to rip this
NnfrYz2MU7o,191440,193760,idea off find a really big map that is
NnfrYz2MU7o,193760,195280,suited to whatever wilderness your
NnfrYz2MU7o,195280,196959,players are exploring drop a bunch of
NnfrYz2MU7o,196959,199040,encounters in and just sit back and see
NnfrYz2MU7o,199040,200959,where they go might be even cooler to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,200959,203120,this with a big dungeon eventually they
NnfrYz2MU7o,203120,204959,find the caravan and i think okay
NnfrYz2MU7o,204959,207360,mission complete good job adventure over
NnfrYz2MU7o,207360,209280,but the players indicated no surprise
NnfrYz2MU7o,209280,210560,that they wanted to keep playing and i
NnfrYz2MU7o,210560,212400,thought okay seemed like an obvious next
NnfrYz2MU7o,212400,214799,step was escort the villagers safely out
NnfrYz2MU7o,214799,215920,of the forest
NnfrYz2MU7o,215920,217440,i basically imagined this adventure as a
NnfrYz2MU7o,217440,219599,kind of heart of darkness apocalypse now
NnfrYz2MU7o,219599,221760,adventure where instead of a jungle it's
NnfrYz2MU7o,221760,223599,a forest but otherwise it is very
NnfrYz2MU7o,223599,225440,episodic they have no idea what's going
NnfrYz2MU7o,225440,227599,to happen next and because it is a wode
NnfrYz2MU7o,227599,229040,i could play around with time and
NnfrYz2MU7o,229040,230879,alternate realities and that gave me a
NnfrYz2MU7o,230879,233120,very broad palette to paint with lots of
NnfrYz2MU7o,233120,234480,cool encounters straightforward
NnfrYz2MU7o,234480,236480,encounters along with high weirdness and
NnfrYz2MU7o,236480,238799,mysteries and foreshadowing i could run
NnfrYz2MU7o,238799,240480,this adventure 10 times and i would
NnfrYz2MU7o,240480,242319,never get bored because i'd always have
NnfrYz2MU7o,242319,244319,new ideas for what crazy stuff might
NnfrYz2MU7o,244319,246720,happen in this forest however and here
NnfrYz2MU7o,246720,248159,we come to the lesson i knew the
NnfrYz2MU7o,248159,250239,villagers would work as a kind of hit
NnfrYz2MU7o,250239,252400,points for the adventure when they left
NnfrYz2MU7o,252400,253920,the village there were 40 of them but by
NnfrYz2MU7o,253920,255120,the time the heroes find them there's
NnfrYz2MU7o,255120,257359,only 28 and the question was
NnfrYz2MU7o,257359,259199,how many will we lose trying to get out
NnfrYz2MU7o,259199,260959,of here now that wasn't the problem that
NnfrYz2MU7o,260959,263440,was a good idea and it worked well uh
NnfrYz2MU7o,263440,265040,with that many villagers i could create
NnfrYz2MU7o,265040,267120,scenarios where i knew some might die
NnfrYz2MU7o,267120,269120,but it didn't mean total failure using
NnfrYz2MU7o,269120,270960,the villagers as a kind of adventure hit
NnfrYz2MU7o,270960,273120,points worked the problem wasn't the
NnfrYz2MU7o,273120,275600,number of villagers it was my ridiculous
NnfrYz2MU7o,275600,277199,idea to try to make each of them
NnfrYz2MU7o,277199,278960,individuals and develop all their
NnfrYz2MU7o,278960,280800,relationships like i knew there were
NnfrYz2MU7o,280800,282160,three generations of families
NnfrYz2MU7o,282160,284000,represented so i had each family tree
NnfrYz2MU7o,284000,285840,mapped out they were all named they all
NnfrYz2MU7o,285840,288160,got unique art and fantasy grounds and i
NnfrYz2MU7o,288160,290560,imagined that a lot of complex behavior
NnfrYz2MU7o,290560,292160,would arise out of this that the
NnfrYz2MU7o,292160,294000,villagers would feel real like real
NnfrYz2MU7o,294000,295440,people that they would argue about what
NnfrYz2MU7o,295440,298160,to do about who to trust now in the end
NnfrYz2MU7o,298160,299280,i don't think the players could even
NnfrYz2MU7o,299280,301919,have named more than maybe two villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,301919,303680,and that includes anne paulie who became
NnfrYz2MU7o,303680,305600,sort of the only villager they cared
NnfrYz2MU7o,305600,307039,about but that's not because the players
NnfrYz2MU7o,307039,308960,weren't engaged they were super engaged
NnfrYz2MU7o,308960,311039,it was because of my decision to try to
NnfrYz2MU7o,311039,313840,present all the villagers equally and it
NnfrYz2MU7o,313840,314960,wasn't like
NnfrYz2MU7o,314960,316400,i did that and the players were
NnfrYz2MU7o,316400,320000,overloaded no i was overloaded i bit off
NnfrYz2MU7o,320000,322960,so much i couldn't even swallow it that
NnfrYz2MU7o,322960,324800,analogy turned out different than i
NnfrYz2MU7o,324800,326720,imagined anyway i couldn't do it i
NnfrYz2MU7o,326720,328160,couldn't keep all the villagers and
NnfrYz2MU7o,328160,329759,their personalities and motivations in
NnfrYz2MU7o,329759,331840,my head at once and it was stupid to try
NnfrYz2MU7o,331840,334080,if this were a game i was designing for
NnfrYz2MU7o,334080,336160,other people to play without me i would
NnfrYz2MU7o,336160,338479,never have made that mistake but as a dm
NnfrYz2MU7o,338479,340720,i get these grandiose ideas and i think
NnfrYz2MU7o,340720,343120,i can do anything nope what i should
NnfrYz2MU7o,343120,345039,have done was had like three
NnfrYz2MU7o,345039,346800,maybe five but certainly no more than
NnfrYz2MU7o,346800,348880,five villagers who represented all the
NnfrYz2MU7o,348880,350000,others and they could each have a point
NnfrYz2MU7o,350000,351759,of view and they could disagree and come
NnfrYz2MU7o,351759,353440,into conflict and the players would get
NnfrYz2MU7o,353440,355360,to know them the reason the players
NnfrYz2MU7o,355360,357600,focused on anne paulie was because she
NnfrYz2MU7o,357600,360639,was cute and simple protect the kid but
NnfrYz2MU7o,360639,362160,if i had picked five villagers and
NnfrYz2MU7o,362160,364800,focused exclusively on them i am 90
NnfrYz2MU7o,364800,366400,certain the players would have had a
NnfrYz2MU7o,366400,368479,more memorable and meaningful experience
NnfrYz2MU7o,368479,369840,dealing with them
NnfrYz2MU7o,369840,371280,five is a good number because i can
NnfrYz2MU7o,371280,373680,create conflicts or explore themes using
NnfrYz2MU7o,373680,375440,different combinations of characters
NnfrYz2MU7o,375440,377919,without overloading one character you
NnfrYz2MU7o,377919,379440,know it would be kind of unbelievable if
NnfrYz2MU7o,379440,381440,every time there was an issue it was
NnfrYz2MU7o,381440,384000,always between these three people with
NnfrYz2MU7o,384000,386560,only three every issue turns into the
NnfrYz2MU7o,386560,388720,reasonable one the unreasonable one and
NnfrYz2MU7o,388720,390960,the one in the middle but five gives me
NnfrYz2MU7o,390960,393520,a lot more subtlety and with five named
NnfrYz2MU7o,393520,395280,important villagers i could lose one or
NnfrYz2MU7o,395280,397360,two including through self-sacrifice and
NnfrYz2MU7o,397360,399120,i would still have a few left
NnfrYz2MU7o,399120,401280,there's so much i could have done themes
NnfrYz2MU7o,401280,402800,about relying on the heroes instead of
NnfrYz2MU7o,402800,404800,themselves about being inspired by the
NnfrYz2MU7o,404800,406800,dragon knight but also sort of blaming
NnfrYz2MU7o,406800,408880,all this on them if the dragon phalanx
NnfrYz2MU7o,408880,410400,had stayed true
NnfrYz2MU7o,410400,412319,good king omen would still be alive and
NnfrYz2MU7o,412319,414160,none of this would have happened themes
NnfrYz2MU7o,414160,415919,about generations and parents and
NnfrYz2MU7o,415919,417680,children and about being afraid of the
NnfrYz2MU7o,417680,420479,future about selfishness and sacrifice
NnfrYz2MU7o,420479,422880,we touched on some of that but not much
NnfrYz2MU7o,422880,424400,so that's another lesson if i were to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,424400,426720,this over again or if you were to do it
NnfrYz2MU7o,426720,428880,an adventure like this is easy i would
NnfrYz2MU7o,428880,430400,still have dozens of villagers and i'd
NnfrYz2MU7o,430400,431599,probably come up with names for all of
NnfrYz2MU7o,431599,433599,them just in case but the only ones who
NnfrYz2MU7o,433599,435840,would talk would be the core five and i
NnfrYz2MU7o,435840,437360,would only need keywords to describe
NnfrYz2MU7o,437360,441039,them fearful brave cynical talkative etc
NnfrYz2MU7o,441039,442319,each would get a couple of these
NnfrYz2MU7o,442319,445680,keywords no one is only one thing
NnfrYz2MU7o,445680,447599,easy that would have been easy but
NnfrYz2MU7o,447599,449199,another lesson that came out of this was
NnfrYz2MU7o,449199,451440,the fact that almost against their will
NnfrYz2MU7o,451440,453199,the players did not want the villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,453199,455360,to die even though i failed to present
NnfrYz2MU7o,455360,457039,them as characters they could engage
NnfrYz2MU7o,457039,459680,with they still eventually really
NnfrYz2MU7o,459680,461840,behaved like these people mattered to
NnfrYz2MU7o,461840,464000,their characters if not the players and
NnfrYz2MU7o,464000,465440,this is tricky i get a lot of questions
NnfrYz2MU7o,465440,467440,about this stuff in chat on twitch where
NnfrYz2MU7o,467440,469599,folks ask how can i get my players to
NnfrYz2MU7o,469599,471440,care and we've got more than a few
NnfrYz2MU7o,471440,472800,videos here that cover that but one of
NnfrYz2MU7o,472800,475199,the problems i think folks don't realize
NnfrYz2MU7o,475199,477759,is that new players and here i mean
NnfrYz2MU7o,477759,479840,players new to the hobby do not arrive
NnfrYz2MU7o,479840,481520,at the table ready and willing to care
NnfrYz2MU7o,481520,484080,about npcs they arrive at the table
NnfrYz2MU7o,484080,486720,ready and willing to play d d which
NnfrYz2MU7o,486720,489039,mostly means fighting monsters and there
NnfrYz2MU7o,489039,491360,isn't a lot you can do about that except
NnfrYz2MU7o,491360,494400,play a lot eventually and i think this
NnfrYz2MU7o,494400,496400,can literally take dozens of sessions
NnfrYz2MU7o,496400,498560,fighting monsters ceases to be this
NnfrYz2MU7o,498560,500639,novel experience and the players start
NnfrYz2MU7o,500639,502720,discovering all this nuance and drama
NnfrYz2MU7o,502720,504639,and potential in the game so you watch
NnfrYz2MU7o,504639,506720,videos of experienced dms online and you
NnfrYz2MU7o,506720,509360,think oh i can do that well
NnfrYz2MU7o,509360,511440,i know you can do it but you have to ask
NnfrYz2MU7o,511440,513440,yourself is this what my players want
NnfrYz2MU7o,513440,515279,are they perfectly happy just killing
NnfrYz2MU7o,515279,516640,monsters
NnfrYz2MU7o,516640,518159,maybe that's why they ignore all the
NnfrYz2MU7o,518159,520880,lore and the npcs you made so these
NnfrYz2MU7o,520880,522719,players in dusk are ready to care about
NnfrYz2MU7o,522719,524640,the villagers even though i didn't do a
NnfrYz2MU7o,524640,526880,great job at giving them good reasons to
NnfrYz2MU7o,526880,529120,and some really interesting behavior
NnfrYz2MU7o,529120,531040,emerged because since they cared about
NnfrYz2MU7o,531040,533839,the villagers suddenly i had encounters
NnfrYz2MU7o,533839,535839,where none of the hero's lives were at
NnfrYz2MU7o,535839,537519,stake like at one point pretty early
NnfrYz2MU7o,537519,538880,after finding the lost caravan the
NnfrYz2MU7o,538880,540959,heroes realize they have to stop the
NnfrYz2MU7o,540959,542800,villagers are trying to bring basically
NnfrYz2MU7o,542800,545440,their entire town with them on carts and
NnfrYz2MU7o,545440,547360,it's just slowing them down too much so
NnfrYz2MU7o,547360,549360,the heroes have to convince them
NnfrYz2MU7o,549360,551120,to leave some stuff behind this is an
NnfrYz2MU7o,551120,552800,encounter i designed on purpose i
NnfrYz2MU7o,552800,554640,invented the idea that the villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,554640,556320,were carrying too much and it slowed
NnfrYz2MU7o,556320,557760,them down and that they'd never make it
NnfrYz2MU7o,557760,559120,out of this forest at the rate they were
NnfrYz2MU7o,559120,561200,traveling i wanted to create a scenario
NnfrYz2MU7o,561200,562800,where the players had to deal with the
NnfrYz2MU7o,562800,563920,villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,563920,565360,some of the villagers don't want to
NnfrYz2MU7o,565360,566480,leave their stuff behind some of the
NnfrYz2MU7o,566480,568160,villagers resent having to take orders
NnfrYz2MU7o,568160,570560,from basically a bunch of aliens
NnfrYz2MU7o,570560,572880,and that becomes the challenge no combat
NnfrYz2MU7o,572880,576000,no initiative just people being people
NnfrYz2MU7o,576000,578240,in this scenario no one's life was at
NnfrYz2MU7o,578240,580800,stake but the players still engaged they
NnfrYz2MU7o,580800,582080,were frustrated at first that the
NnfrYz2MU7o,582080,583600,villagers didn't just automatically do
NnfrYz2MU7o,583600,585519,whatever the players told them to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,585519,587200,that happens all the time players tend
NnfrYz2MU7o,587200,590560,to treat npcs like video game npcs and
NnfrYz2MU7o,590560,592720,not like real people but honestly in
NnfrYz2MU7o,592720,594480,this case that's because i was putting
NnfrYz2MU7o,594480,596560,complex tensions in front of them but
NnfrYz2MU7o,596560,597760,they didn't know any of these people
NnfrYz2MU7o,597760,599920,well enough to imagine them complexly
NnfrYz2MU7o,599920,601600,because i was trying to make them all
NnfrYz2MU7o,601600,603680,complex and failing so
NnfrYz2MU7o,603680,605519,none of them seemed complex
NnfrYz2MU7o,605519,606800,once the players took the problem
NnfrYz2MU7o,606800,608720,seriously though they really engaged
NnfrYz2MU7o,608720,610399,with it was very cool seeing their
NnfrYz2MU7o,610399,612160,solutions so that was one challenge
NnfrYz2MU7o,612160,613760,where there were no monsters no one
NnfrYz2MU7o,613760,616079,called initiative just people
NnfrYz2MU7o,616079,618320,being people it reminds me of a fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,618320,620399,moment in the castle rend campaign where
NnfrYz2MU7o,620399,622720,nicodemus who is a newly minted count
NnfrYz2MU7o,622720,624959,has a small village that is coalesced
NnfrYz2MU7o,624959,626880,around his ruined keep these people are
NnfrYz2MU7o,626880,628800,basically volunteer peasant labor and
NnfrYz2MU7o,628800,631040,one of the workers a kid is accused of
NnfrYz2MU7o,631040,632800,stealing from another worker
NnfrYz2MU7o,632800,634800,this is not a city with cops and judges
NnfrYz2MU7o,634800,636720,and jails it's just a ruined keep in the
NnfrYz2MU7o,636720,638560,middle of the forest and nicodemus has
NnfrYz2MU7o,638560,640800,to figure out what do i do
NnfrYz2MU7o,640800,642160,what is the right thing to do what is
NnfrYz2MU7o,642160,644160,the practical thing to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,644160,646240,if i do the wrong thing how will the
NnfrYz2MU7o,646240,648320,other peasants react what if what i
NnfrYz2MU7o,648320,649600,think is right
NnfrYz2MU7o,649600,651760,just pisses these people off i need them
NnfrYz2MU7o,651760,653760,to help me rebuild this keep
NnfrYz2MU7o,653760,656000,they look to me for protection and
NnfrYz2MU7o,656000,658240,leadership if i screw this up they might
NnfrYz2MU7o,658240,660160,all drop their hammers and go home i
NnfrYz2MU7o,660160,661920,think sometimes folks make the mistake
NnfrYz2MU7o,661920,663519,of imagining that in order to get the
NnfrYz2MU7o,663519,665360,players to care about stuff besides
NnfrYz2MU7o,665360,667760,their own skins they need to like the
NnfrYz2MU7o,667760,669680,npcs they need to actually care about
NnfrYz2MU7o,669680,672000,them as people but i think that makes
NnfrYz2MU7o,672000,673680,this a harder problem than it needs to
NnfrYz2MU7o,673680,675600,be the players in dusk didn't like the
NnfrYz2MU7o,675600,677519,villagers with you know one exception
NnfrYz2MU7o,677519,679279,nicodemus didn't even know who these
NnfrYz2MU7o,679279,680560,people were
NnfrYz2MU7o,680560,682000,i hadn't spent much time establishing
NnfrYz2MU7o,682000,684800,them as individuals but in both cases
NnfrYz2MU7o,684800,686959,the people were the point
NnfrYz2MU7o,686959,688959,like them or not nicodemus needed them
NnfrYz2MU7o,688959,690480,like them or not waterhead was
NnfrYz2MU7o,690480,692000,responsible for getting these people to
NnfrYz2MU7o,692000,695440,safety so liking the npcs is by no means
NnfrYz2MU7o,695440,697120,the most important issue
NnfrYz2MU7o,697120,699040,one of the coolest moments in dusk and
NnfrYz2MU7o,699040,700640,this is saying something as each session
NnfrYz2MU7o,700640,702800,was super memorable was when a griffin
NnfrYz2MU7o,702800,704320,looking to find food for its newly
NnfrYz2MU7o,704320,706720,hatched chicks decided one of these old
NnfrYz2MU7o,706720,708399,villagers wouldn't be missed
NnfrYz2MU7o,708399,710399,just a random old lady maybe she had
NnfrYz2MU7o,710399,711920,some dialogue earlier in the campaign
NnfrYz2MU7o,711920,713760,maybe some of the players remembered her
NnfrYz2MU7o,713760,715040,name but i don't think it would have
NnfrYz2MU7o,715040,717120,mattered either way this was definitely
NnfrYz2MU7o,717120,719680,a life or death scenario but it wasn't
NnfrYz2MU7o,719680,722240,the hero's lives on the line a griffin
NnfrYz2MU7o,722240,723920,is no big deal for them the challenge
NnfrYz2MU7o,723920,725440,was stopping the griffin from flying
NnfrYz2MU7o,725440,727440,away with a delicious villager or
NnfrYz2MU7o,727440,729279,recovering her if the griffin managed to
NnfrYz2MU7o,729279,730480,whisk her away
NnfrYz2MU7o,730480,732160,and the amazing thing about this is
NnfrYz2MU7o,732160,734880,because the heroes weren't in jeopardy
NnfrYz2MU7o,734880,736160,that meant
NnfrYz2MU7o,736160,738079,they could be brave
NnfrYz2MU7o,738079,739920,really brave brave in a way you don't
NnfrYz2MU7o,739920,741760,normally get when it's literally just us
NnfrYz2MU7o,741760,744160,versus them all pcs on one side all
NnfrYz2MU7o,744160,745600,monsters on the other
NnfrYz2MU7o,745600,747519,because zoga borhart's solution to this
NnfrYz2MU7o,747519,750800,was push the old woman down and stand
NnfrYz2MU7o,750800,753200,over her so the griffin would and did
NnfrYz2MU7o,753200,755680,grab zoga instead
NnfrYz2MU7o,755680,757920,that kind of self-sacrifice it just
NnfrYz2MU7o,757920,759519,wouldn't happen otherwise you can't push
NnfrYz2MU7o,759519,762320,a hero down and stand over them then
NnfrYz2MU7o,762320,764160,you're down one hero
NnfrYz2MU7o,764160,766079,this is a huge lesson for me the hero's
NnfrYz2MU7o,766079,767600,bravery is measured in what they are
NnfrYz2MU7o,767600,769600,willing to risk to save the people
NnfrYz2MU7o,769600,771519,another lesson which is to say another
NnfrYz2MU7o,771519,773839,thing i failed to do was design
NnfrYz2MU7o,773839,775360,encounters to give each player a chance
NnfrYz2MU7o,775360,777360,to shine some players got those moments
NnfrYz2MU7o,777360,779440,but only a couple and in every instance
NnfrYz2MU7o,779440,781600,it was because it emerged dynamically
NnfrYz2MU7o,781600,783440,from the narrative i didn't really plan
NnfrYz2MU7o,783440,786000,it for instance zoga barhart excellent
NnfrYz2MU7o,786000,787360,character played by my friend tom
NnfrYz2MU7o,787360,789360,schmuck he's a tactician and a leader i
NnfrYz2MU7o,789360,791279,mean he is literally a warlord that's
NnfrYz2MU7o,791279,793920,his class and warlords are leaders with
NnfrYz2MU7o,793920,796320,a capital l in 4e so what i should have
NnfrYz2MU7o,796320,798480,done was create at least one encounter
NnfrYz2MU7o,798480,800399,with a neutral tribe of
NnfrYz2MU7o,800399,802320,whatever in this giant forest and make
NnfrYz2MU7o,802320,804800,negotiating with them the point and that
NnfrYz2MU7o,804800,806959,would give zoga a chance to shine this
NnfrYz2MU7o,806959,808480,is something i think i'm actually pretty
NnfrYz2MU7o,808480,809760,good at so
NnfrYz2MU7o,809760,811920,why didn't i do it well mostly i think i
NnfrYz2MU7o,811920,813839,was just in love with the find a cool
NnfrYz2MU7o,813839,816399,map toss some monsters on it process if
NnfrYz2MU7o,816399,818079,you were gonna run something like dusk
NnfrYz2MU7o,818079,819920,the whole point of it being episodic
NnfrYz2MU7o,819920,821600,meaning each session presents some
NnfrYz2MU7o,821600,822800,challenge to overcome which has a
NnfrYz2MU7o,822800,824639,beginning a middle and an end and is
NnfrYz2MU7o,824639,827040,unrelated to the next challenge is that
NnfrYz2MU7o,827040,829040,you can do whatever you want in a given
NnfrYz2MU7o,829040,831040,session i bet you already have ideas of
NnfrYz2MU7o,831040,833279,what kind of diplomacy challenge i could
NnfrYz2MU7o,833279,835279,have put in front of the heroes
NnfrYz2MU7o,835279,837279,so these are a few lessons broadly
NnfrYz2MU7o,837279,839199,applicable to most dms but also i think
NnfrYz2MU7o,839199,840639,there's enough in this video to get you
NnfrYz2MU7o,840639,842800,started if you want to run your own dusk
NnfrYz2MU7o,842800,844480,style adventure
NnfrYz2MU7o,844480,845760,thanks for watching folks if you like
NnfrYz2MU7o,845760,847120,this video and want to get an alert when
NnfrYz2MU7o,847120,848880,we upload something new click the bell

NnfrYz2MU7o,853199,855440,next video i don't know but i think it
NnfrYz2MU7o,855440,857279,might be about lore and i think you're
NnfrYz2MU7o,857279,860000,gonna like it until next time peace
NnfrYz2MU7o,860000,862480,out
vid,start,end,text
NnfrYz2MU7o,0,1680,hey folks if you missed the kickstarter
NnfrYz2MU7o,1680,4160,and want to pre-order flea mortals the
NnfrYz2MU7o,4160,6879,mcdm monster book pre-orders are open we
NnfrYz2MU7o,6879,8480,also have a channel in our discord for
NnfrYz2MU7o,8480,9599,talking about the monsters we've
NnfrYz2MU7o,9599,11679,released so far and there are more
NnfrYz2MU7o,11679,13599,monsters coming soon a link in the
NnfrYz2MU7o,13599,16000,doobly-doo on with the show this is one
NnfrYz2MU7o,16000,17119,of those videos that has a couple of
NnfrYz2MU7o,17119,18160,lessons in it i think you could
NnfrYz2MU7o,18160,20480,basically use this video to run your own
NnfrYz2MU7o,20480,22400,dusk adventure but i couldn't figure out
NnfrYz2MU7o,22400,23920,how to turn each of these lessons into
NnfrYz2MU7o,23920,25840,their own videos so there's a bunch of
NnfrYz2MU7o,25840,28240,advice in here that usually means fewer
NnfrYz2MU7o,28240,30080,people watch it which you know that that
NnfrYz2MU7o,30080,31679,makes me sad because i put a lot of work
NnfrYz2MU7o,31679,33920,into this stuff but i see it as my role
NnfrYz2MU7o,33920,35680,to teach what i've learned and if some
NnfrYz2MU7o,35680,37920,lessons are complex and they don't boil
NnfrYz2MU7o,37920,39680,down easily into a video with a clear
NnfrYz2MU7o,39680,41760,thesis and a clever title
NnfrYz2MU7o,41760,43440,i know some people will still get use
NnfrYz2MU7o,43440,46079,out of it anyway you get it i think the
NnfrYz2MU7o,46079,47200,first part of this video could have been
NnfrYz2MU7o,47200,49440,called too many villagers hair mozart
NnfrYz2MU7o,49440,52239,how shall one say director
NnfrYz2MU7o,52239,54719,too many notes your majesty exactly very
NnfrYz2MU7o,54719,56960,well put too many notes so if you don't
NnfrYz2MU7o,56960,59120,know what dusk is it's a campaign i ran
NnfrYz2MU7o,59120,60800,last year for my friends you can watch
NnfrYz2MU7o,60800,61840,the whole thing right here on this
NnfrYz2MU7o,61840,64239,channel playlist here the idea was very
NnfrYz2MU7o,64239,66080,simple and straightforward and that was
NnfrYz2MU7o,66080,68400,the power of it step one find the
NnfrYz2MU7o,68400,70240,missing villagers a whole town full of
NnfrYz2MU7o,70240,72320,them they are in the forest somewhere
NnfrYz2MU7o,72320,73600,they live up in the north and there's a
NnfrYz2MU7o,73600,75119,lot of strife up there so they decided
NnfrYz2MU7o,75119,77200,to brave the elf haunted forest to the
NnfrYz2MU7o,77200,79439,south and make for literally greener
NnfrYz2MU7o,79439,81439,pastures there used to be a road through
NnfrYz2MU7o,81439,83119,the forest so the villagers think how
NnfrYz2MU7o,83119,84479,hard can it be
NnfrYz2MU7o,84479,86320,that's the setup find the missing
NnfrYz2MU7o,86320,88080,caravan and originally i thought that
NnfrYz2MU7o,88080,89439,would be the whole thing i didn't think
NnfrYz2MU7o,89439,91759,it was a campaign i just wanted to show
NnfrYz2MU7o,91759,93840,off fourth edition 4e was a lot of fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,93840,95840,it had a ton of cool features it was a
NnfrYz2MU7o,95840,98320,very forward-looking product and the
NnfrYz2MU7o,98320,100159,players loved it a couple of them asked
NnfrYz2MU7o,100159,102880,can we just run the chain of akron in 4e
NnfrYz2MU7o,102880,105280,yep i don't i don't know no not not
NnfrYz2MU7o,105280,107600,right now but maybe later like after the
NnfrYz2MU7o,107600,109759,heist we'll see so for the entire first
NnfrYz2MU7o,109759,111680,part of the campaign there were no
NnfrYz2MU7o,111680,113360,villagers to worry about i figured the
NnfrYz2MU7o,113360,114960,game would end when they found the
NnfrYz2MU7o,114960,117759,missing villagers this was just a a demo
NnfrYz2MU7o,117759,119280,an excuse to throw a bunch of fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,119280,120960,encounters at the players which meant it
NnfrYz2MU7o,120960,122960,was also very easy to prep mostly what i
NnfrYz2MU7o,122960,125280,did was scrub through a few fantasy map
NnfrYz2MU7o,125280,127119,patreons links in the doobly-doo and
NnfrYz2MU7o,127119,129200,when i saw a map that inspired me well
NnfrYz2MU7o,129200,131599,that was the next encounter that process
NnfrYz2MU7o,131599,134400,find a cool enchanted forest map build
NnfrYz2MU7o,134400,136800,and encounter for it was easy and fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,136800,138400,for me i could prep an entire session in
NnfrYz2MU7o,138400,140000,just a couple of hours before we played
NnfrYz2MU7o,140000,142319,which compared to the chain of akron was
NnfrYz2MU7o,142319,145040,like paradise one thing i did which i
NnfrYz2MU7o,145040,146239,don't think would have worked anywhere
NnfrYz2MU7o,146239,147760,near as well if we were playing in
NnfrYz2MU7o,147760,149680,person was one session i just put a
NnfrYz2MU7o,149680,152239,gigantic tactical map in front of them i
NnfrYz2MU7o,152239,154080,dropped them on the edge of this huge
NnfrYz2MU7o,154080,157760,forest map and i said okay go ahead we
NnfrYz2MU7o,157760,159120,were using fantasy grounds which has
NnfrYz2MU7o,159120,160879,dynamic lighting and i dropped a bunch
NnfrYz2MU7o,160879,162879,of encounters around it was really cool
NnfrYz2MU7o,162879,164720,it was a knight and od's character
NnfrYz2MU7o,164720,166080,doesn't have dark vision so when the
NnfrYz2MU7o,166080,168480,player with the light walked away matt
NnfrYz2MU7o,168480,170560,was literally plunged into darkness his
NnfrYz2MU7o,170560,172640,entire map turned totally black with
NnfrYz2MU7o,172640,174879,just his icon there floating in space
NnfrYz2MU7o,174879,176640,and you could hear him yell
NnfrYz2MU7o,176640,178159,this was awesome and letting them
NnfrYz2MU7o,178159,179760,literally just walk around on the map
NnfrYz2MU7o,179760,181680,and explore on their own go in different
NnfrYz2MU7o,181680,183599,directions until eventually one or two
NnfrYz2MU7o,183599,185920,of them ran into a threat was something
NnfrYz2MU7o,185920,187680,i don't even know how i would do at the
NnfrYz2MU7o,187680,189200,table so that's a little something if
NnfrYz2MU7o,189200,191440,you're using a vtt feel free to rip this
NnfrYz2MU7o,191440,193760,idea off find a really big map that is
NnfrYz2MU7o,193760,195280,suited to whatever wilderness your
NnfrYz2MU7o,195280,196959,players are exploring drop a bunch of
NnfrYz2MU7o,196959,199040,encounters in and just sit back and see
NnfrYz2MU7o,199040,200959,where they go might be even cooler to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,200959,203120,this with a big dungeon eventually they
NnfrYz2MU7o,203120,204959,find the caravan and i think okay
NnfrYz2MU7o,204959,207360,mission complete good job adventure over
NnfrYz2MU7o,207360,209280,but the players indicated no surprise
NnfrYz2MU7o,209280,210560,that they wanted to keep playing and i
NnfrYz2MU7o,210560,212400,thought okay seemed like an obvious next
NnfrYz2MU7o,212400,214799,step was escort the villagers safely out
NnfrYz2MU7o,214799,215920,of the forest
NnfrYz2MU7o,215920,217440,i basically imagined this adventure as a
NnfrYz2MU7o,217440,219599,kind of heart of darkness apocalypse now
NnfrYz2MU7o,219599,221760,adventure where instead of a jungle it's
NnfrYz2MU7o,221760,223599,a forest but otherwise it is very
NnfrYz2MU7o,223599,225440,episodic they have no idea what's going
NnfrYz2MU7o,225440,227599,to happen next and because it is a wode
NnfrYz2MU7o,227599,229040,i could play around with time and
NnfrYz2MU7o,229040,230879,alternate realities and that gave me a
NnfrYz2MU7o,230879,233120,very broad palette to paint with lots of
NnfrYz2MU7o,233120,234480,cool encounters straightforward
NnfrYz2MU7o,234480,236480,encounters along with high weirdness and
NnfrYz2MU7o,236480,238799,mysteries and foreshadowing i could run
NnfrYz2MU7o,238799,240480,this adventure 10 times and i would
NnfrYz2MU7o,240480,242319,never get bored because i'd always have
NnfrYz2MU7o,242319,244319,new ideas for what crazy stuff might
NnfrYz2MU7o,244319,246720,happen in this forest however and here
NnfrYz2MU7o,246720,248159,we come to the lesson i knew the
NnfrYz2MU7o,248159,250239,villagers would work as a kind of hit
NnfrYz2MU7o,250239,252400,points for the adventure when they left
NnfrYz2MU7o,252400,253920,the village there were 40 of them but by
NnfrYz2MU7o,253920,255120,the time the heroes find them there's
NnfrYz2MU7o,255120,257359,only 28 and the question was
NnfrYz2MU7o,257359,259199,how many will we lose trying to get out
NnfrYz2MU7o,259199,260959,of here now that wasn't the problem that
NnfrYz2MU7o,260959,263440,was a good idea and it worked well uh
NnfrYz2MU7o,263440,265040,with that many villagers i could create
NnfrYz2MU7o,265040,267120,scenarios where i knew some might die
NnfrYz2MU7o,267120,269120,but it didn't mean total failure using
NnfrYz2MU7o,269120,270960,the villagers as a kind of adventure hit
NnfrYz2MU7o,270960,273120,points worked the problem wasn't the
NnfrYz2MU7o,273120,275600,number of villagers it was my ridiculous
NnfrYz2MU7o,275600,277199,idea to try to make each of them
NnfrYz2MU7o,277199,278960,individuals and develop all their
NnfrYz2MU7o,278960,280800,relationships like i knew there were
NnfrYz2MU7o,280800,282160,three generations of families
NnfrYz2MU7o,282160,284000,represented so i had each family tree
NnfrYz2MU7o,284000,285840,mapped out they were all named they all
NnfrYz2MU7o,285840,288160,got unique art and fantasy grounds and i
NnfrYz2MU7o,288160,290560,imagined that a lot of complex behavior
NnfrYz2MU7o,290560,292160,would arise out of this that the
NnfrYz2MU7o,292160,294000,villagers would feel real like real
NnfrYz2MU7o,294000,295440,people that they would argue about what
NnfrYz2MU7o,295440,298160,to do about who to trust now in the end
NnfrYz2MU7o,298160,299280,i don't think the players could even
NnfrYz2MU7o,299280,301919,have named more than maybe two villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,301919,303680,and that includes anne paulie who became
NnfrYz2MU7o,303680,305600,sort of the only villager they cared
NnfrYz2MU7o,305600,307039,about but that's not because the players
NnfrYz2MU7o,307039,308960,weren't engaged they were super engaged
NnfrYz2MU7o,308960,311039,it was because of my decision to try to
NnfrYz2MU7o,311039,313840,present all the villagers equally and it
NnfrYz2MU7o,313840,314960,wasn't like
NnfrYz2MU7o,314960,316400,i did that and the players were
NnfrYz2MU7o,316400,320000,overloaded no i was overloaded i bit off
NnfrYz2MU7o,320000,322960,so much i couldn't even swallow it that
NnfrYz2MU7o,322960,324800,analogy turned out different than i
NnfrYz2MU7o,324800,326720,imagined anyway i couldn't do it i
NnfrYz2MU7o,326720,328160,couldn't keep all the villagers and
NnfrYz2MU7o,328160,329759,their personalities and motivations in
NnfrYz2MU7o,329759,331840,my head at once and it was stupid to try
NnfrYz2MU7o,331840,334080,if this were a game i was designing for
NnfrYz2MU7o,334080,336160,other people to play without me i would
NnfrYz2MU7o,336160,338479,never have made that mistake but as a dm
NnfrYz2MU7o,338479,340720,i get these grandiose ideas and i think
NnfrYz2MU7o,340720,343120,i can do anything nope what i should
NnfrYz2MU7o,343120,345039,have done was had like three
NnfrYz2MU7o,345039,346800,maybe five but certainly no more than
NnfrYz2MU7o,346800,348880,five villagers who represented all the
NnfrYz2MU7o,348880,350000,others and they could each have a point
NnfrYz2MU7o,350000,351759,of view and they could disagree and come
NnfrYz2MU7o,351759,353440,into conflict and the players would get
NnfrYz2MU7o,353440,355360,to know them the reason the players
NnfrYz2MU7o,355360,357600,focused on anne paulie was because she
NnfrYz2MU7o,357600,360639,was cute and simple protect the kid but
NnfrYz2MU7o,360639,362160,if i had picked five villagers and
NnfrYz2MU7o,362160,364800,focused exclusively on them i am 90
NnfrYz2MU7o,364800,366400,certain the players would have had a
NnfrYz2MU7o,366400,368479,more memorable and meaningful experience
NnfrYz2MU7o,368479,369840,dealing with them
NnfrYz2MU7o,369840,371280,five is a good number because i can
NnfrYz2MU7o,371280,373680,create conflicts or explore themes using
NnfrYz2MU7o,373680,375440,different combinations of characters
NnfrYz2MU7o,375440,377919,without overloading one character you
NnfrYz2MU7o,377919,379440,know it would be kind of unbelievable if
NnfrYz2MU7o,379440,381440,every time there was an issue it was
NnfrYz2MU7o,381440,384000,always between these three people with
NnfrYz2MU7o,384000,386560,only three every issue turns into the
NnfrYz2MU7o,386560,388720,reasonable one the unreasonable one and
NnfrYz2MU7o,388720,390960,the one in the middle but five gives me
NnfrYz2MU7o,390960,393520,a lot more subtlety and with five named
NnfrYz2MU7o,393520,395280,important villagers i could lose one or
NnfrYz2MU7o,395280,397360,two including through self-sacrifice and
NnfrYz2MU7o,397360,399120,i would still have a few left
NnfrYz2MU7o,399120,401280,there's so much i could have done themes
NnfrYz2MU7o,401280,402800,about relying on the heroes instead of
NnfrYz2MU7o,402800,404800,themselves about being inspired by the
NnfrYz2MU7o,404800,406800,dragon knight but also sort of blaming
NnfrYz2MU7o,406800,408880,all this on them if the dragon phalanx
NnfrYz2MU7o,408880,410400,had stayed true
NnfrYz2MU7o,410400,412319,good king omen would still be alive and
NnfrYz2MU7o,412319,414160,none of this would have happened themes
NnfrYz2MU7o,414160,415919,about generations and parents and
NnfrYz2MU7o,415919,417680,children and about being afraid of the
NnfrYz2MU7o,417680,420479,future about selfishness and sacrifice
NnfrYz2MU7o,420479,422880,we touched on some of that but not much
NnfrYz2MU7o,422880,424400,so that's another lesson if i were to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,424400,426720,this over again or if you were to do it
NnfrYz2MU7o,426720,428880,an adventure like this is easy i would
NnfrYz2MU7o,428880,430400,still have dozens of villagers and i'd
NnfrYz2MU7o,430400,431599,probably come up with names for all of
NnfrYz2MU7o,431599,433599,them just in case but the only ones who
NnfrYz2MU7o,433599,435840,would talk would be the core five and i
NnfrYz2MU7o,435840,437360,would only need keywords to describe
NnfrYz2MU7o,437360,441039,them fearful brave cynical talkative etc
NnfrYz2MU7o,441039,442319,each would get a couple of these
NnfrYz2MU7o,442319,445680,keywords no one is only one thing
NnfrYz2MU7o,445680,447599,easy that would have been easy but
NnfrYz2MU7o,447599,449199,another lesson that came out of this was
NnfrYz2MU7o,449199,451440,the fact that almost against their will
NnfrYz2MU7o,451440,453199,the players did not want the villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,453199,455360,to die even though i failed to present
NnfrYz2MU7o,455360,457039,them as characters they could engage
NnfrYz2MU7o,457039,459680,with they still eventually really
NnfrYz2MU7o,459680,461840,behaved like these people mattered to
NnfrYz2MU7o,461840,464000,their characters if not the players and
NnfrYz2MU7o,464000,465440,this is tricky i get a lot of questions
NnfrYz2MU7o,465440,467440,about this stuff in chat on twitch where
NnfrYz2MU7o,467440,469599,folks ask how can i get my players to
NnfrYz2MU7o,469599,471440,care and we've got more than a few
NnfrYz2MU7o,471440,472800,videos here that cover that but one of
NnfrYz2MU7o,472800,475199,the problems i think folks don't realize
NnfrYz2MU7o,475199,477759,is that new players and here i mean
NnfrYz2MU7o,477759,479840,players new to the hobby do not arrive
NnfrYz2MU7o,479840,481520,at the table ready and willing to care
NnfrYz2MU7o,481520,484080,about npcs they arrive at the table
NnfrYz2MU7o,484080,486720,ready and willing to play d d which
NnfrYz2MU7o,486720,489039,mostly means fighting monsters and there
NnfrYz2MU7o,489039,491360,isn't a lot you can do about that except
NnfrYz2MU7o,491360,494400,play a lot eventually and i think this
NnfrYz2MU7o,494400,496400,can literally take dozens of sessions
NnfrYz2MU7o,496400,498560,fighting monsters ceases to be this
NnfrYz2MU7o,498560,500639,novel experience and the players start
NnfrYz2MU7o,500639,502720,discovering all this nuance and drama
NnfrYz2MU7o,502720,504639,and potential in the game so you watch
NnfrYz2MU7o,504639,506720,videos of experienced dms online and you
NnfrYz2MU7o,506720,509360,think oh i can do that well
NnfrYz2MU7o,509360,511440,i know you can do it but you have to ask
NnfrYz2MU7o,511440,513440,yourself is this what my players want
NnfrYz2MU7o,513440,515279,are they perfectly happy just killing
NnfrYz2MU7o,515279,516640,monsters
NnfrYz2MU7o,516640,518159,maybe that's why they ignore all the
NnfrYz2MU7o,518159,520880,lore and the npcs you made so these
NnfrYz2MU7o,520880,522719,players in dusk are ready to care about
NnfrYz2MU7o,522719,524640,the villagers even though i didn't do a
NnfrYz2MU7o,524640,526880,great job at giving them good reasons to
NnfrYz2MU7o,526880,529120,and some really interesting behavior
NnfrYz2MU7o,529120,531040,emerged because since they cared about
NnfrYz2MU7o,531040,533839,the villagers suddenly i had encounters
NnfrYz2MU7o,533839,535839,where none of the hero's lives were at
NnfrYz2MU7o,535839,537519,stake like at one point pretty early
NnfrYz2MU7o,537519,538880,after finding the lost caravan the
NnfrYz2MU7o,538880,540959,heroes realize they have to stop the
NnfrYz2MU7o,540959,542800,villagers are trying to bring basically
NnfrYz2MU7o,542800,545440,their entire town with them on carts and
NnfrYz2MU7o,545440,547360,it's just slowing them down too much so
NnfrYz2MU7o,547360,549360,the heroes have to convince them
NnfrYz2MU7o,549360,551120,to leave some stuff behind this is an
NnfrYz2MU7o,551120,552800,encounter i designed on purpose i
NnfrYz2MU7o,552800,554640,invented the idea that the villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,554640,556320,were carrying too much and it slowed
NnfrYz2MU7o,556320,557760,them down and that they'd never make it
NnfrYz2MU7o,557760,559120,out of this forest at the rate they were
NnfrYz2MU7o,559120,561200,traveling i wanted to create a scenario
NnfrYz2MU7o,561200,562800,where the players had to deal with the
NnfrYz2MU7o,562800,563920,villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,563920,565360,some of the villagers don't want to
NnfrYz2MU7o,565360,566480,leave their stuff behind some of the
NnfrYz2MU7o,566480,568160,villagers resent having to take orders
NnfrYz2MU7o,568160,570560,from basically a bunch of aliens
NnfrYz2MU7o,570560,572880,and that becomes the challenge no combat
NnfrYz2MU7o,572880,576000,no initiative just people being people
NnfrYz2MU7o,576000,578240,in this scenario no one's life was at
NnfrYz2MU7o,578240,580800,stake but the players still engaged they
NnfrYz2MU7o,580800,582080,were frustrated at first that the
NnfrYz2MU7o,582080,583600,villagers didn't just automatically do
NnfrYz2MU7o,583600,585519,whatever the players told them to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,585519,587200,that happens all the time players tend
NnfrYz2MU7o,587200,590560,to treat npcs like video game npcs and
NnfrYz2MU7o,590560,592720,not like real people but honestly in
NnfrYz2MU7o,592720,594480,this case that's because i was putting
NnfrYz2MU7o,594480,596560,complex tensions in front of them but
NnfrYz2MU7o,596560,597760,they didn't know any of these people
NnfrYz2MU7o,597760,599920,well enough to imagine them complexly
NnfrYz2MU7o,599920,601600,because i was trying to make them all
NnfrYz2MU7o,601600,603680,complex and failing so
NnfrYz2MU7o,603680,605519,none of them seemed complex
NnfrYz2MU7o,605519,606800,once the players took the problem
NnfrYz2MU7o,606800,608720,seriously though they really engaged
NnfrYz2MU7o,608720,610399,with it was very cool seeing their
NnfrYz2MU7o,610399,612160,solutions so that was one challenge
NnfrYz2MU7o,612160,613760,where there were no monsters no one
NnfrYz2MU7o,613760,616079,called initiative just people
NnfrYz2MU7o,616079,618320,being people it reminds me of a fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,618320,620399,moment in the castle rend campaign where
NnfrYz2MU7o,620399,622720,nicodemus who is a newly minted count
NnfrYz2MU7o,622720,624959,has a small village that is coalesced
NnfrYz2MU7o,624959,626880,around his ruined keep these people are
NnfrYz2MU7o,626880,628800,basically volunteer peasant labor and
NnfrYz2MU7o,628800,631040,one of the workers a kid is accused of
NnfrYz2MU7o,631040,632800,stealing from another worker
NnfrYz2MU7o,632800,634800,this is not a city with cops and judges
NnfrYz2MU7o,634800,636720,and jails it's just a ruined keep in the
NnfrYz2MU7o,636720,638560,middle of the forest and nicodemus has
NnfrYz2MU7o,638560,640800,to figure out what do i do
NnfrYz2MU7o,640800,642160,what is the right thing to do what is
NnfrYz2MU7o,642160,644160,the practical thing to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,644160,646240,if i do the wrong thing how will the
NnfrYz2MU7o,646240,648320,other peasants react what if what i
NnfrYz2MU7o,648320,649600,think is right
NnfrYz2MU7o,649600,651760,just pisses these people off i need them
NnfrYz2MU7o,651760,653760,to help me rebuild this keep
NnfrYz2MU7o,653760,656000,they look to me for protection and
NnfrYz2MU7o,656000,658240,leadership if i screw this up they might
NnfrYz2MU7o,658240,660160,all drop their hammers and go home i
NnfrYz2MU7o,660160,661920,think sometimes folks make the mistake
NnfrYz2MU7o,661920,663519,of imagining that in order to get the
NnfrYz2MU7o,663519,665360,players to care about stuff besides
NnfrYz2MU7o,665360,667760,their own skins they need to like the
NnfrYz2MU7o,667760,669680,npcs they need to actually care about
NnfrYz2MU7o,669680,672000,them as people but i think that makes
NnfrYz2MU7o,672000,673680,this a harder problem than it needs to
NnfrYz2MU7o,673680,675600,be the players in dusk didn't like the
NnfrYz2MU7o,675600,677519,villagers with you know one exception
NnfrYz2MU7o,677519,679279,nicodemus didn't even know who these
NnfrYz2MU7o,679279,680560,people were
NnfrYz2MU7o,680560,682000,i hadn't spent much time establishing
NnfrYz2MU7o,682000,684800,them as individuals but in both cases
NnfrYz2MU7o,684800,686959,the people were the point
NnfrYz2MU7o,686959,688959,like them or not nicodemus needed them
NnfrYz2MU7o,688959,690480,like them or not waterhead was
NnfrYz2MU7o,690480,692000,responsible for getting these people to
NnfrYz2MU7o,692000,695440,safety so liking the npcs is by no means
NnfrYz2MU7o,695440,697120,the most important issue
NnfrYz2MU7o,697120,699040,one of the coolest moments in dusk and
NnfrYz2MU7o,699040,700640,this is saying something as each session
NnfrYz2MU7o,700640,702800,was super memorable was when a griffin
NnfrYz2MU7o,702800,704320,looking to find food for its newly
NnfrYz2MU7o,704320,706720,hatched chicks decided one of these old
NnfrYz2MU7o,706720,708399,villagers wouldn't be missed
NnfrYz2MU7o,708399,710399,just a random old lady maybe she had
NnfrYz2MU7o,710399,711920,some dialogue earlier in the campaign
NnfrYz2MU7o,711920,713760,maybe some of the players remembered her
NnfrYz2MU7o,713760,715040,name but i don't think it would have
NnfrYz2MU7o,715040,717120,mattered either way this was definitely
NnfrYz2MU7o,717120,719680,a life or death scenario but it wasn't
NnfrYz2MU7o,719680,722240,the hero's lives on the line a griffin
NnfrYz2MU7o,722240,723920,is no big deal for them the challenge
NnfrYz2MU7o,723920,725440,was stopping the griffin from flying
NnfrYz2MU7o,725440,727440,away with a delicious villager or
NnfrYz2MU7o,727440,729279,recovering her if the griffin managed to
NnfrYz2MU7o,729279,730480,whisk her away
NnfrYz2MU7o,730480,732160,and the amazing thing about this is
NnfrYz2MU7o,732160,734880,because the heroes weren't in jeopardy
NnfrYz2MU7o,734880,736160,that meant
NnfrYz2MU7o,736160,738079,they could be brave
NnfrYz2MU7o,738079,739920,really brave brave in a way you don't
NnfrYz2MU7o,739920,741760,normally get when it's literally just us
NnfrYz2MU7o,741760,744160,versus them all pcs on one side all
NnfrYz2MU7o,744160,745600,monsters on the other
NnfrYz2MU7o,745600,747519,because zoga borhart's solution to this
NnfrYz2MU7o,747519,750800,was push the old woman down and stand
NnfrYz2MU7o,750800,753200,over her so the griffin would and did
NnfrYz2MU7o,753200,755680,grab zoga instead
NnfrYz2MU7o,755680,757920,that kind of self-sacrifice it just
NnfrYz2MU7o,757920,759519,wouldn't happen otherwise you can't push
NnfrYz2MU7o,759519,762320,a hero down and stand over them then
NnfrYz2MU7o,762320,764160,you're down one hero
NnfrYz2MU7o,764160,766079,this is a huge lesson for me the hero's
NnfrYz2MU7o,766079,767600,bravery is measured in what they are
NnfrYz2MU7o,767600,769600,willing to risk to save the people
NnfrYz2MU7o,769600,771519,another lesson which is to say another
NnfrYz2MU7o,771519,773839,thing i failed to do was design
NnfrYz2MU7o,773839,775360,encounters to give each player a chance
NnfrYz2MU7o,775360,777360,to shine some players got those moments
NnfrYz2MU7o,777360,779440,but only a couple and in every instance
NnfrYz2MU7o,779440,781600,it was because it emerged dynamically
NnfrYz2MU7o,781600,783440,from the narrative i didn't really plan
NnfrYz2MU7o,783440,786000,it for instance zoga barhart excellent
NnfrYz2MU7o,786000,787360,character played by my friend tom
NnfrYz2MU7o,787360,789360,schmuck he's a tactician and a leader i
NnfrYz2MU7o,789360,791279,mean he is literally a warlord that's
NnfrYz2MU7o,791279,793920,his class and warlords are leaders with
NnfrYz2MU7o,793920,796320,a capital l in 4e so what i should have
NnfrYz2MU7o,796320,798480,done was create at least one encounter
NnfrYz2MU7o,798480,800399,with a neutral tribe of
NnfrYz2MU7o,800399,802320,whatever in this giant forest and make
NnfrYz2MU7o,802320,804800,negotiating with them the point and that
NnfrYz2MU7o,804800,806959,would give zoga a chance to shine this
NnfrYz2MU7o,806959,808480,is something i think i'm actually pretty
NnfrYz2MU7o,808480,809760,good at so
NnfrYz2MU7o,809760,811920,why didn't i do it well mostly i think i
NnfrYz2MU7o,811920,813839,was just in love with the find a cool
NnfrYz2MU7o,813839,816399,map toss some monsters on it process if
NnfrYz2MU7o,816399,818079,you were gonna run something like dusk
NnfrYz2MU7o,818079,819920,the whole point of it being episodic
NnfrYz2MU7o,819920,821600,meaning each session presents some
NnfrYz2MU7o,821600,822800,challenge to overcome which has a
NnfrYz2MU7o,822800,824639,beginning a middle and an end and is
NnfrYz2MU7o,824639,827040,unrelated to the next challenge is that
NnfrYz2MU7o,827040,829040,you can do whatever you want in a given
NnfrYz2MU7o,829040,831040,session i bet you already have ideas of
NnfrYz2MU7o,831040,833279,what kind of diplomacy challenge i could
NnfrYz2MU7o,833279,835279,have put in front of the heroes
NnfrYz2MU7o,835279,837279,so these are a few lessons broadly
NnfrYz2MU7o,837279,839199,applicable to most dms but also i think
NnfrYz2MU7o,839199,840639,there's enough in this video to get you
NnfrYz2MU7o,840639,842800,started if you want to run your own dusk
NnfrYz2MU7o,842800,844480,style adventure
NnfrYz2MU7o,844480,845760,thanks for watching folks if you like
NnfrYz2MU7o,845760,847120,this video and want to get an alert when
NnfrYz2MU7o,847120,848880,we upload something new click the bell

NnfrYz2MU7o,853199,855440,next video i don't know but i think it
NnfrYz2MU7o,855440,857279,might be about lore and i think you're
NnfrYz2MU7o,857279,860000,gonna like it until next time peace

NnfrYz2MU7o,0,1680,hey folks if you missed the kickstarter
NnfrYz2MU7o,1680,4160,and want to pre-order flea mortals the
NnfrYz2MU7o,4160,6879,mcdm monster book pre-orders are open we
NnfrYz2MU7o,6879,8480,also have a channel in our discord for
NnfrYz2MU7o,8480,9599,talking about the monsters we've
NnfrYz2MU7o,9599,11679,released so far and there are more
NnfrYz2MU7o,11679,13599,monsters coming soon a link in the
NnfrYz2MU7o,13599,16000,doobly-doo on with the show this is one
NnfrYz2MU7o,16000,17119,of those videos that has a couple of
NnfrYz2MU7o,17119,18160,lessons in it i think you could
NnfrYz2MU7o,18160,20480,basically use this video to run your own
NnfrYz2MU7o,20480,22400,dusk adventure but i couldn't figure out
NnfrYz2MU7o,22400,23920,how to turn each of these lessons into
NnfrYz2MU7o,23920,25840,their own videos so there's a bunch of
NnfrYz2MU7o,25840,28240,advice in here that usually means fewer
NnfrYz2MU7o,28240,30080,people watch it which you know that that
NnfrYz2MU7o,30080,31679,makes me sad because i put a lot of work
NnfrYz2MU7o,31679,33920,into this stuff but i see it as my role
NnfrYz2MU7o,33920,35680,to teach what i've learned and if some
NnfrYz2MU7o,35680,37920,lessons are complex and they don't boil
NnfrYz2MU7o,37920,39680,down easily into a video with a clear
NnfrYz2MU7o,39680,41760,thesis and a clever title
NnfrYz2MU7o,41760,43440,i know some people will still get use
NnfrYz2MU7o,43440,46079,out of it anyway you get it i think the
NnfrYz2MU7o,46079,47200,first part of this video could have been
NnfrYz2MU7o,47200,49440,called too many villagers hair mozart
NnfrYz2MU7o,49440,52239,how shall one say director
NnfrYz2MU7o,52239,54719,too many notes your majesty exactly very
NnfrYz2MU7o,54719,56960,well put too many notes so if you don't
NnfrYz2MU7o,56960,59120,know what dusk is it's a campaign i ran
NnfrYz2MU7o,59120,60800,last year for my friends you can watch
NnfrYz2MU7o,60800,61840,the whole thing right here on this
NnfrYz2MU7o,61840,64239,channel playlist here the idea was very
NnfrYz2MU7o,64239,66080,simple and straightforward and that was
NnfrYz2MU7o,66080,68400,the power of it step one find the
NnfrYz2MU7o,68400,70240,missing villagers a whole town full of
NnfrYz2MU7o,70240,72320,them they are in the forest somewhere
NnfrYz2MU7o,72320,73600,they live up in the north and there's a
NnfrYz2MU7o,73600,75119,lot of strife up there so they decided
NnfrYz2MU7o,75119,77200,to brave the elf haunted forest to the
NnfrYz2MU7o,77200,79439,south and make for literally greener
NnfrYz2MU7o,79439,81439,pastures there used to be a road through
NnfrYz2MU7o,81439,83119,the forest so the villagers think how
NnfrYz2MU7o,83119,84479,hard can it be
NnfrYz2MU7o,84479,86320,that's the setup find the missing
NnfrYz2MU7o,86320,88080,caravan and originally i thought that
NnfrYz2MU7o,88080,89439,would be the whole thing i didn't think
NnfrYz2MU7o,89439,91759,it was a campaign i just wanted to show
NnfrYz2MU7o,91759,93840,off fourth edition 4e was a lot of fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,93840,95840,it had a ton of cool features it was a
NnfrYz2MU7o,95840,98320,very forward-looking product and the
NnfrYz2MU7o,98320,100159,players loved it a couple of them asked
NnfrYz2MU7o,100159,102880,can we just run the chain of akron in 4e
NnfrYz2MU7o,102880,105280,yep i don't i don't know no not not
NnfrYz2MU7o,105280,107600,right now but maybe later like after the
NnfrYz2MU7o,107600,109759,heist we'll see so for the entire first
NnfrYz2MU7o,109759,111680,part of the campaign there were no
NnfrYz2MU7o,111680,113360,villagers to worry about i figured the
NnfrYz2MU7o,113360,114960,game would end when they found the
NnfrYz2MU7o,114960,117759,missing villagers this was just a a demo
NnfrYz2MU7o,117759,119280,an excuse to throw a bunch of fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,119280,120960,encounters at the players which meant it
NnfrYz2MU7o,120960,122960,was also very easy to prep mostly what i
NnfrYz2MU7o,122960,125280,did was scrub through a few fantasy map
NnfrYz2MU7o,125280,127119,patreons links in the doobly-doo and
NnfrYz2MU7o,127119,129200,when i saw a map that inspired me well
NnfrYz2MU7o,129200,131599,that was the next encounter that process
NnfrYz2MU7o,131599,134400,find a cool enchanted forest map build
NnfrYz2MU7o,134400,136800,and encounter for it was easy and fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,136800,138400,for me i could prep an entire session in
NnfrYz2MU7o,138400,140000,just a couple of hours before we played
NnfrYz2MU7o,140000,142319,which compared to the chain of akron was
NnfrYz2MU7o,142319,145040,like paradise one thing i did which i
NnfrYz2MU7o,145040,146239,don't think would have worked anywhere
NnfrYz2MU7o,146239,147760,near as well if we were playing in
NnfrYz2MU7o,147760,149680,person was one session i just put a
NnfrYz2MU7o,149680,152239,gigantic tactical map in front of them i
NnfrYz2MU7o,152239,154080,dropped them on the edge of this huge
NnfrYz2MU7o,154080,157760,forest map and i said okay go ahead we
NnfrYz2MU7o,157760,159120,were using fantasy grounds which has
NnfrYz2MU7o,159120,160879,dynamic lighting and i dropped a bunch
NnfrYz2MU7o,160879,162879,of encounters around it was really cool
NnfrYz2MU7o,162879,164720,it was a knight and od's character
NnfrYz2MU7o,164720,166080,doesn't have dark vision so when the
NnfrYz2MU7o,166080,168480,player with the light walked away matt
NnfrYz2MU7o,168480,170560,was literally plunged into darkness his
NnfrYz2MU7o,170560,172640,entire map turned totally black with
NnfrYz2MU7o,172640,174879,just his icon there floating in space
NnfrYz2MU7o,174879,176640,and you could hear him yell
NnfrYz2MU7o,176640,178159,this was awesome and letting them
NnfrYz2MU7o,178159,179760,literally just walk around on the map
NnfrYz2MU7o,179760,181680,and explore on their own go in different
NnfrYz2MU7o,181680,183599,directions until eventually one or two
NnfrYz2MU7o,183599,185920,of them ran into a threat was something
NnfrYz2MU7o,185920,187680,i don't even know how i would do at the
NnfrYz2MU7o,187680,189200,table so that's a little something if
NnfrYz2MU7o,189200,191440,you're using a vtt feel free to rip this
NnfrYz2MU7o,191440,193760,idea off find a really big map that is
NnfrYz2MU7o,193760,195280,suited to whatever wilderness your
NnfrYz2MU7o,195280,196959,players are exploring drop a bunch of
NnfrYz2MU7o,196959,199040,encounters in and just sit back and see
NnfrYz2MU7o,199040,200959,where they go might be even cooler to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,200959,203120,this with a big dungeon eventually they
NnfrYz2MU7o,203120,204959,find the caravan and i think okay
NnfrYz2MU7o,204959,207360,mission complete good job adventure over
NnfrYz2MU7o,207360,209280,but the players indicated no surprise
NnfrYz2MU7o,209280,210560,that they wanted to keep playing and i
NnfrYz2MU7o,210560,212400,thought okay seemed like an obvious next
NnfrYz2MU7o,212400,214799,step was escort the villagers safely out
NnfrYz2MU7o,214799,215920,of the forest
NnfrYz2MU7o,215920,217440,i basically imagined this adventure as a
NnfrYz2MU7o,217440,219599,kind of heart of darkness apocalypse now
NnfrYz2MU7o,219599,221760,adventure where instead of a jungle it's
NnfrYz2MU7o,221760,223599,a forest but otherwise it is very
NnfrYz2MU7o,223599,225440,episodic they have no idea what's going
NnfrYz2MU7o,225440,227599,to happen next and because it is a wode
NnfrYz2MU7o,227599,229040,i could play around with time and
NnfrYz2MU7o,229040,230879,alternate realities and that gave me a
NnfrYz2MU7o,230879,233120,very broad palette to paint with lots of
NnfrYz2MU7o,233120,234480,cool encounters straightforward
NnfrYz2MU7o,234480,236480,encounters along with high weirdness and
NnfrYz2MU7o,236480,238799,mysteries and foreshadowing i could run
NnfrYz2MU7o,238799,240480,this adventure 10 times and i would
NnfrYz2MU7o,240480,242319,never get bored because i'd always have
NnfrYz2MU7o,242319,244319,new ideas for what crazy stuff might
NnfrYz2MU7o,244319,246720,happen in this forest however and here
NnfrYz2MU7o,246720,248159,we come to the lesson i knew the
NnfrYz2MU7o,248159,250239,villagers would work as a kind of hit
NnfrYz2MU7o,250239,252400,points for the adventure when they left
NnfrYz2MU7o,252400,253920,the village there were 40 of them but by
NnfrYz2MU7o,253920,255120,the time the heroes find them there's
NnfrYz2MU7o,255120,257359,only 28 and the question was
NnfrYz2MU7o,257359,259199,how many will we lose trying to get out
NnfrYz2MU7o,259199,260959,of here now that wasn't the problem that
NnfrYz2MU7o,260959,263440,was a good idea and it worked well uh
NnfrYz2MU7o,263440,265040,with that many villagers i could create
NnfrYz2MU7o,265040,267120,scenarios where i knew some might die
NnfrYz2MU7o,267120,269120,but it didn't mean total failure using
NnfrYz2MU7o,269120,270960,the villagers as a kind of adventure hit
NnfrYz2MU7o,270960,273120,points worked the problem wasn't the
NnfrYz2MU7o,273120,275600,number of villagers it was my ridiculous
NnfrYz2MU7o,275600,277199,idea to try to make each of them
NnfrYz2MU7o,277199,278960,individuals and develop all their
NnfrYz2MU7o,278960,280800,relationships like i knew there were
NnfrYz2MU7o,280800,282160,three generations of families
NnfrYz2MU7o,282160,284000,represented so i had each family tree
NnfrYz2MU7o,284000,285840,mapped out they were all named they all
NnfrYz2MU7o,285840,288160,got unique art and fantasy grounds and i
NnfrYz2MU7o,288160,290560,imagined that a lot of complex behavior
NnfrYz2MU7o,290560,292160,would arise out of this that the
NnfrYz2MU7o,292160,294000,villagers would feel real like real
NnfrYz2MU7o,294000,295440,people that they would argue about what
NnfrYz2MU7o,295440,298160,to do about who to trust now in the end
NnfrYz2MU7o,298160,299280,i don't think the players could even
NnfrYz2MU7o,299280,301919,have named more than maybe two villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,301919,303680,and that includes anne paulie who became
NnfrYz2MU7o,303680,305600,sort of the only villager they cared
NnfrYz2MU7o,305600,307039,about but that's not because the players
NnfrYz2MU7o,307039,308960,weren't engaged they were super engaged
NnfrYz2MU7o,308960,311039,it was because of my decision to try to
NnfrYz2MU7o,311039,313840,present all the villagers equally and it
NnfrYz2MU7o,313840,314960,wasn't like
NnfrYz2MU7o,314960,316400,i did that and the players were
NnfrYz2MU7o,316400,320000,overloaded no i was overloaded i bit off
NnfrYz2MU7o,320000,322960,so much i couldn't even swallow it that
NnfrYz2MU7o,322960,324800,analogy turned out different than i
NnfrYz2MU7o,324800,326720,imagined anyway i couldn't do it i
NnfrYz2MU7o,326720,328160,couldn't keep all the villagers and
NnfrYz2MU7o,328160,329759,their personalities and motivations in
NnfrYz2MU7o,329759,331840,my head at once and it was stupid to try
NnfrYz2MU7o,331840,334080,if this were a game i was designing for
NnfrYz2MU7o,334080,336160,other people to play without me i would
NnfrYz2MU7o,336160,338479,never have made that mistake but as a dm
NnfrYz2MU7o,338479,340720,i get these grandiose ideas and i think
NnfrYz2MU7o,340720,343120,i can do anything nope what i should
NnfrYz2MU7o,343120,345039,have done was had like three
NnfrYz2MU7o,345039,346800,maybe five but certainly no more than
NnfrYz2MU7o,346800,348880,five villagers who represented all the
NnfrYz2MU7o,348880,350000,others and they could each have a point
NnfrYz2MU7o,350000,351759,of view and they could disagree and come
NnfrYz2MU7o,351759,353440,into conflict and the players would get
NnfrYz2MU7o,353440,355360,to know them the reason the players
NnfrYz2MU7o,355360,357600,focused on anne paulie was because she
NnfrYz2MU7o,357600,360639,was cute and simple protect the kid but
NnfrYz2MU7o,360639,362160,if i had picked five villagers and
NnfrYz2MU7o,362160,364800,focused exclusively on them i am 90
NnfrYz2MU7o,364800,366400,certain the players would have had a
NnfrYz2MU7o,366400,368479,more memorable and meaningful experience
NnfrYz2MU7o,368479,369840,dealing with them
NnfrYz2MU7o,369840,371280,five is a good number because i can
NnfrYz2MU7o,371280,373680,create conflicts or explore themes using
NnfrYz2MU7o,373680,375440,different combinations of characters
NnfrYz2MU7o,375440,377919,without overloading one character you
NnfrYz2MU7o,377919,379440,know it would be kind of unbelievable if
NnfrYz2MU7o,379440,381440,every time there was an issue it was
NnfrYz2MU7o,381440,384000,always between these three people with
NnfrYz2MU7o,384000,386560,only three every issue turns into the
NnfrYz2MU7o,386560,388720,reasonable one the unreasonable one and
NnfrYz2MU7o,388720,390960,the one in the middle but five gives me
NnfrYz2MU7o,390960,393520,a lot more subtlety and with five named
NnfrYz2MU7o,393520,395280,important villagers i could lose one or
NnfrYz2MU7o,395280,397360,two including through self-sacrifice and
NnfrYz2MU7o,397360,399120,i would still have a few left
NnfrYz2MU7o,399120,401280,there's so much i could have done themes
NnfrYz2MU7o,401280,402800,about relying on the heroes instead of
NnfrYz2MU7o,402800,404800,themselves about being inspired by the
NnfrYz2MU7o,404800,406800,dragon knight but also sort of blaming
NnfrYz2MU7o,406800,408880,all this on them if the dragon phalanx
NnfrYz2MU7o,408880,410400,had stayed true
NnfrYz2MU7o,410400,412319,good king omen would still be alive and
NnfrYz2MU7o,412319,414160,none of this would have happened themes
NnfrYz2MU7o,414160,415919,about generations and parents and
NnfrYz2MU7o,415919,417680,children and about being afraid of the
NnfrYz2MU7o,417680,420479,future about selfishness and sacrifice
NnfrYz2MU7o,420479,422880,we touched on some of that but not much
NnfrYz2MU7o,422880,424400,so that's another lesson if i were to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,424400,426720,this over again or if you were to do it
NnfrYz2MU7o,426720,428880,an adventure like this is easy i would
NnfrYz2MU7o,428880,430400,still have dozens of villagers and i'd
NnfrYz2MU7o,430400,431599,probably come up with names for all of
NnfrYz2MU7o,431599,433599,them just in case but the only ones who
NnfrYz2MU7o,433599,435840,would talk would be the core five and i
NnfrYz2MU7o,435840,437360,would only need keywords to describe
NnfrYz2MU7o,437360,441039,them fearful brave cynical talkative etc
NnfrYz2MU7o,441039,442319,each would get a couple of these
NnfrYz2MU7o,442319,445680,keywords no one is only one thing
NnfrYz2MU7o,445680,447599,easy that would have been easy but
NnfrYz2MU7o,447599,449199,another lesson that came out of this was
NnfrYz2MU7o,449199,451440,the fact that almost against their will
NnfrYz2MU7o,451440,453199,the players did not want the villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,453199,455360,to die even though i failed to present
NnfrYz2MU7o,455360,457039,them as characters they could engage
NnfrYz2MU7o,457039,459680,with they still eventually really
NnfrYz2MU7o,459680,461840,behaved like these people mattered to
NnfrYz2MU7o,461840,464000,their characters if not the players and
NnfrYz2MU7o,464000,465440,this is tricky i get a lot of questions
NnfrYz2MU7o,465440,467440,about this stuff in chat on twitch where
NnfrYz2MU7o,467440,469599,folks ask how can i get my players to
NnfrYz2MU7o,469599,471440,care and we've got more than a few
NnfrYz2MU7o,471440,472800,videos here that cover that but one of
NnfrYz2MU7o,472800,475199,the problems i think folks don't realize
NnfrYz2MU7o,475199,477759,is that new players and here i mean
NnfrYz2MU7o,477759,479840,players new to the hobby do not arrive
NnfrYz2MU7o,479840,481520,at the table ready and willing to care
NnfrYz2MU7o,481520,484080,about npcs they arrive at the table
NnfrYz2MU7o,484080,486720,ready and willing to play d d which
NnfrYz2MU7o,486720,489039,mostly means fighting monsters and there
NnfrYz2MU7o,489039,491360,isn't a lot you can do about that except
NnfrYz2MU7o,491360,494400,play a lot eventually and i think this
NnfrYz2MU7o,494400,496400,can literally take dozens of sessions
NnfrYz2MU7o,496400,498560,fighting monsters ceases to be this
NnfrYz2MU7o,498560,500639,novel experience and the players start
NnfrYz2MU7o,500639,502720,discovering all this nuance and drama
NnfrYz2MU7o,502720,504639,and potential in the game so you watch
NnfrYz2MU7o,504639,506720,videos of experienced dms online and you
NnfrYz2MU7o,506720,509360,think oh i can do that well
NnfrYz2MU7o,509360,511440,i know you can do it but you have to ask
NnfrYz2MU7o,511440,513440,yourself is this what my players want
NnfrYz2MU7o,513440,515279,are they perfectly happy just killing
NnfrYz2MU7o,515279,516640,monsters
NnfrYz2MU7o,516640,518159,maybe that's why they ignore all the
NnfrYz2MU7o,518159,520880,lore and the npcs you made so these
NnfrYz2MU7o,520880,522719,players in dusk are ready to care about
NnfrYz2MU7o,522719,524640,the villagers even though i didn't do a
NnfrYz2MU7o,524640,526880,great job at giving them good reasons to
NnfrYz2MU7o,526880,529120,and some really interesting behavior
NnfrYz2MU7o,529120,531040,emerged because since they cared about
NnfrYz2MU7o,531040,533839,the villagers suddenly i had encounters
NnfrYz2MU7o,533839,535839,where none of the hero's lives were at
NnfrYz2MU7o,535839,537519,stake like at one point pretty early
NnfrYz2MU7o,537519,538880,after finding the lost caravan the
NnfrYz2MU7o,538880,540959,heroes realize they have to stop the
NnfrYz2MU7o,540959,542800,villagers are trying to bring basically
NnfrYz2MU7o,542800,545440,their entire town with them on carts and
NnfrYz2MU7o,545440,547360,it's just slowing them down too much so
NnfrYz2MU7o,547360,549360,the heroes have to convince them
NnfrYz2MU7o,549360,551120,to leave some stuff behind this is an
NnfrYz2MU7o,551120,552800,encounter i designed on purpose i
NnfrYz2MU7o,552800,554640,invented the idea that the villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,554640,556320,were carrying too much and it slowed
NnfrYz2MU7o,556320,557760,them down and that they'd never make it
NnfrYz2MU7o,557760,559120,out of this forest at the rate they were
NnfrYz2MU7o,559120,561200,traveling i wanted to create a scenario
NnfrYz2MU7o,561200,562800,where the players had to deal with the
NnfrYz2MU7o,562800,563920,villagers
NnfrYz2MU7o,563920,565360,some of the villagers don't want to
NnfrYz2MU7o,565360,566480,leave their stuff behind some of the
NnfrYz2MU7o,566480,568160,villagers resent having to take orders
NnfrYz2MU7o,568160,570560,from basically a bunch of aliens
NnfrYz2MU7o,570560,572880,and that becomes the challenge no combat
NnfrYz2MU7o,572880,576000,no initiative just people being people
NnfrYz2MU7o,576000,578240,in this scenario no one's life was at
NnfrYz2MU7o,578240,580800,stake but the players still engaged they
NnfrYz2MU7o,580800,582080,were frustrated at first that the
NnfrYz2MU7o,582080,583600,villagers didn't just automatically do
NnfrYz2MU7o,583600,585519,whatever the players told them to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,585519,587200,that happens all the time players tend
NnfrYz2MU7o,587200,590560,to treat npcs like video game npcs and
NnfrYz2MU7o,590560,592720,not like real people but honestly in
NnfrYz2MU7o,592720,594480,this case that's because i was putting
NnfrYz2MU7o,594480,596560,complex tensions in front of them but
NnfrYz2MU7o,596560,597760,they didn't know any of these people
NnfrYz2MU7o,597760,599920,well enough to imagine them complexly
NnfrYz2MU7o,599920,601600,because i was trying to make them all
NnfrYz2MU7o,601600,603680,complex and failing so
NnfrYz2MU7o,603680,605519,none of them seemed complex
NnfrYz2MU7o,605519,606800,once the players took the problem
NnfrYz2MU7o,606800,608720,seriously though they really engaged
NnfrYz2MU7o,608720,610399,with it was very cool seeing their
NnfrYz2MU7o,610399,612160,solutions so that was one challenge
NnfrYz2MU7o,612160,613760,where there were no monsters no one
NnfrYz2MU7o,613760,616079,called initiative just people
NnfrYz2MU7o,616079,618320,being people it reminds me of a fun
NnfrYz2MU7o,618320,620399,moment in the castle rend campaign where
NnfrYz2MU7o,620399,622720,nicodemus who is a newly minted count
NnfrYz2MU7o,622720,624959,has a small village that is coalesced
NnfrYz2MU7o,624959,626880,around his ruined keep these people are
NnfrYz2MU7o,626880,628800,basically volunteer peasant labor and
NnfrYz2MU7o,628800,631040,one of the workers a kid is accused of
NnfrYz2MU7o,631040,632800,stealing from another worker
NnfrYz2MU7o,632800,634800,this is not a city with cops and judges
NnfrYz2MU7o,634800,636720,and jails it's just a ruined keep in the
NnfrYz2MU7o,636720,638560,middle of the forest and nicodemus has
NnfrYz2MU7o,638560,640800,to figure out what do i do
NnfrYz2MU7o,640800,642160,what is the right thing to do what is
NnfrYz2MU7o,642160,644160,the practical thing to do
NnfrYz2MU7o,644160,646240,if i do the wrong thing how will the
NnfrYz2MU7o,646240,648320,other peasants react what if what i
NnfrYz2MU7o,648320,649600,think is right
NnfrYz2MU7o,649600,651760,just pisses these people off i need them
NnfrYz2MU7o,651760,653760,to help me rebuild this keep
NnfrYz2MU7o,653760,656000,they look to me for protection and
NnfrYz2MU7o,656000,658240,leadership if i screw this up they might
NnfrYz2MU7o,658240,660160,all drop their hammers and go home i
NnfrYz2MU7o,660160,661920,think sometimes folks make the mistake
NnfrYz2MU7o,661920,663519,of imagining that in order to get the
NnfrYz2MU7o,663519,665360,players to care about stuff besides
NnfrYz2MU7o,665360,667760,their own skins they need to like the
NnfrYz2MU7o,667760,669680,npcs they need to actually care about
NnfrYz2MU7o,669680,672000,them as people but i think that makes
NnfrYz2MU7o,672000,673680,this a harder problem than it needs to
NnfrYz2MU7o,673680,675600,be the players in dusk didn't like the
NnfrYz2MU7o,675600,677519,villagers with you know one exception
NnfrYz2MU7o,677519,679279,nicodemus didn't even know who these
NnfrYz2MU7o,679279,680560,people were
NnfrYz2MU7o,680560,682000,i hadn't spent much time establishing
NnfrYz2MU7o,682000,684800,them as individuals but in both cases
NnfrYz2MU7o,684800,686959,the people were the point
NnfrYz2MU7o,686959,688959,like them or not nicodemus needed them
NnfrYz2MU7o,688959,690480,like them or not waterhead was
NnfrYz2MU7o,690480,692000,responsible for getting these people to
NnfrYz2MU7o,692000,695440,safety so liking the npcs is by no means
NnfrYz2MU7o,695440,697120,the most important issue
NnfrYz2MU7o,697120,699040,one of the coolest moments in dusk and
NnfrYz2MU7o,699040,700640,this is saying something as each session
NnfrYz2MU7o,700640,702800,was super memorable was when a griffin
NnfrYz2MU7o,702800,704320,looking to find food for its newly
NnfrYz2MU7o,704320,706720,hatched chicks decided one of these old
NnfrYz2MU7o,706720,708399,villagers wouldn't be missed
NnfrYz2MU7o,708399,710399,just a random old lady maybe she had
NnfrYz2MU7o,710399,711920,some dialogue earlier in the campaign
NnfrYz2MU7o,711920,713760,maybe some of the players remembered her
NnfrYz2MU7o,713760,715040,name but i don't think it would have
NnfrYz2MU7o,715040,717120,mattered either way this was definitely
NnfrYz2MU7o,717120,719680,a life or death scenario but it wasn't
NnfrYz2MU7o,719680,722240,the hero's lives on the line a griffin
NnfrYz2MU7o,722240,723920,is no big deal for them the challenge
NnfrYz2MU7o,723920,725440,was stopping the griffin from flying
NnfrYz2MU7o,725440,727440,away with a delicious villager or
NnfrYz2MU7o,727440,729279,recovering her if the griffin managed to
NnfrYz2MU7o,729279,730480,whisk her away
NnfrYz2MU7o,730480,732160,and the amazing thing about this is
NnfrYz2MU7o,732160,734880,because the heroes weren't in jeopardy
NnfrYz2MU7o,734880,736160,that meant
NnfrYz2MU7o,736160,738079,they could be brave
NnfrYz2MU7o,738079,739920,really brave brave in a way you don't
NnfrYz2MU7o,739920,741760,normally get when it's literally just us
NnfrYz2MU7o,741760,744160,versus them all pcs on one side all
NnfrYz2MU7o,744160,745600,monsters on the other
NnfrYz2MU7o,745600,747519,because zoga borhart's solution to this
NnfrYz2MU7o,747519,750800,was push the old woman down and stand
NnfrYz2MU7o,750800,753200,over her so the griffin would and did
NnfrYz2MU7o,753200,755680,grab zoga instead
NnfrYz2MU7o,755680,757920,that kind of self-sacrifice it just
NnfrYz2MU7o,757920,759519,wouldn't happen otherwise you can't push
NnfrYz2MU7o,759519,762320,a hero down and stand over them then
NnfrYz2MU7o,762320,764160,you're down one hero
NnfrYz2MU7o,764160,766079,this is a huge lesson for me the hero's
NnfrYz2MU7o,766079,767600,bravery is measured in what they are
NnfrYz2MU7o,767600,769600,willing to risk to save the people
NnfrYz2MU7o,769600,771519,another lesson which is to say another
NnfrYz2MU7o,771519,773839,thing i failed to do was design
NnfrYz2MU7o,773839,775360,encounters to give each player a chance
NnfrYz2MU7o,775360,777360,to shine some players got those moments
NnfrYz2MU7o,777360,779440,but only a couple and in every instance
NnfrYz2MU7o,779440,781600,it was because it emerged dynamically
NnfrYz2MU7o,781600,783440,from the narrative i didn't really plan
NnfrYz2MU7o,783440,786000,it for instance zoga barhart excellent
NnfrYz2MU7o,786000,787360,character played by my friend tom
NnfrYz2MU7o,787360,789360,schmuck he's a tactician and a leader i
NnfrYz2MU7o,789360,791279,mean he is literally a warlord that's
NnfrYz2MU7o,791279,793920,his class and warlords are leaders with
NnfrYz2MU7o,793920,796320,a capital l in 4e so what i should have
NnfrYz2MU7o,796320,798480,done was create at least one encounter
NnfrYz2MU7o,798480,800399,with a neutral tribe of
NnfrYz2MU7o,800399,802320,whatever in this giant forest and make
NnfrYz2MU7o,802320,804800,negotiating with them the point and that
NnfrYz2MU7o,804800,806959,would give zoga a chance to shine this
NnfrYz2MU7o,806959,808480,is something i think i'm actually pretty
NnfrYz2MU7o,808480,809760,good at so
NnfrYz2MU7o,809760,811920,why didn't i do it well mostly i think i
NnfrYz2MU7o,811920,813839,was just in love with the find a cool
NnfrYz2MU7o,813839,816399,map toss some monsters on it process if
NnfrYz2MU7o,816399,818079,you were gonna run something like dusk
NnfrYz2MU7o,818079,819920,the whole point of it being episodic
NnfrYz2MU7o,819920,821600,meaning each session presents some
NnfrYz2MU7o,821600,822800,challenge to overcome which has a
NnfrYz2MU7o,822800,824639,beginning a middle and an end and is
NnfrYz2MU7o,824639,827040,unrelated to the next challenge is that
NnfrYz2MU7o,827040,829040,you can do whatever you want in a given
NnfrYz2MU7o,829040,831040,session i bet you already have ideas of
NnfrYz2MU7o,831040,833279,what kind of diplomacy challenge i could
NnfrYz2MU7o,833279,835279,have put in front of the heroes
NnfrYz2MU7o,835279,837279,so these are a few lessons broadly
NnfrYz2MU7o,837279,839199,applicable to most dms but also i think
NnfrYz2MU7o,839199,840639,there's enough in this video to get you
NnfrYz2MU7o,840639,842800,started if you want to run your own dusk
NnfrYz2MU7o,842800,844480,style adventure
