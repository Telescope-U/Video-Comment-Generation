A6OwnNe9nMU,1274480,1281120,of bed  aching muscles lie still in rebellion  pretending not to hear your brain  commanding them to move a legion of
A6OwnNe9nMU,1281120,1286400,voices are shouting their unanimous  permission for you to hit the snooze  button and go back to dreamland
A6OwnNe9nMU,1286400,1291919,but you didn't ask their opinion  the voice you've chosen to listen to is  one of defiance a voice that says there
A6OwnNe9nMU,1291919,1297440,was a reason you set that alarm in the  first place so sit up put your feet on  the floor and don't look back because
A6OwnNe9nMU,1297440,1304919,we've got work to do  welcome to the grind
A6OwnNe9nMU,1305120,1311440,for what is each day but a series of  conflicts between the right way and the  easy way  ten thousand streams fan out like a
A6OwnNe9nMU,1311440,1318720,river delta before you each one  promising the path of least resistance  thing is you're headed upstream
A6OwnNe9nMU,1318720,1323919,and when you make that choice when you  decide to turn your back on what's  comfortable and safe and what some would
A6OwnNe9nMU,1323919,1329280,call common sense well that's day one  from there it only gets tougher so just
A6OwnNe9nMU,1329280,1336000,make sure this is something you want  because the easy way out will always be  there ready to wash you away
A6OwnNe9nMU,1336000,1339679,all you have to do is pick up your feet
A6OwnNe9nMU,1343039,1348480,but you aren't going to are you with  each step comes the decision to take  another you're on your way now but this
A6OwnNe9nMU,1348480,1355120,is no time to do well on how far you've  come you're in a fight against an  opponent you can't see but oh you can  feel them on your heels can't you feel
A6OwnNe9nMU,1355120,1361280,them breathing down your neck you know  what that is that's you your fears your  doubts and insecurities all lined up
A6OwnNe9nMU,1361280,1367600,like a firing squad ready to shoot you  out of the sky  but don't lose heart  while they're not easily defeated they
A6OwnNe9nMU,1367600,1374320,are far from invincible  remember this is the grind the battle  royale between you and your mind your
A6OwnNe9nMU,1374320,1379440,body and the devil on your shoulder is  telling you that this is just a game  this is just a waste of time your
A6OwnNe9nMU,1379440,1385039,opponents are stronger than you  drown out the voice of uncertainty with  the sound of your own heartbeat burn
A6OwnNe9nMU,1385039,1390559,away your self-doubt with a fire lit  beneath you remember what we're fighting  for and never forget that momentum is a
A6OwnNe9nMU,1390559,1396240,cruel mistress she can turn on a dime or  the smallest mistake she is ever  searching for the weak place in your
A6OwnNe9nMU,1396240,1401919,armor that one tiny thing you forgot to  prepare for  so as long as the devil is hiding the
A6OwnNe9nMU,1401919,1408640,details the question remains is that all  you got  are you sure  and when the answer is yes when you've
A6OwnNe9nMU,1408640,1415760,done all you can to prepare yourself for  battle then it's time to go forth and  boldly face your enemy the enemy within
A6OwnNe9nMU,1415760,1422799,only now you must take that fight into  the open into hostile territory you're a  lion in a field of lions all hunting the
A6OwnNe9nMU,1422799,1429360,same elusive prey with a desperate  starvation that says victory is the only  thing that can keep you alive so believe
A6OwnNe9nMU,1429360,1434960,that voice that says you can run a  little faster and you can throw a little  harder and that for you the laws of
A6OwnNe9nMU,1434960,1440080,physics are merely a suggestion  luck is the last dying wish of those who
A6OwnNe9nMU,1440080,1445120,want to believe that winning can happen  by accident sweat on the other hand is  for those who know it's a choice so
A6OwnNe9nMU,1445120,1450960,decide now because destiny waits for no  man and when your time comes and a  thousand different voices are trying to
A6OwnNe9nMU,1450960,1457279,tell you you're not ready for it listen  instead to that lone voice of descent  the one that says you are ready you are
A6OwnNe9nMU,1457279,1464360,prepared it's all up to you now  so rise and shine

A6OwnNe9nMU,1656720,1663760,between living and dying  i'll tell you this in any fight
A6OwnNe9nMU,1663760,1669200,it's the guy who's willing to die  who's going gonna win that itch
A6OwnNe9nMU,1669200,1674720,and i know if i'm gonna have any life in  it  it's because i'm still willing to fight
A6OwnNe9nMU,1674720,1680840,and die for that itch  because that's what living

A6OwnNe9nMU,3226160,3229160,so
A6OwnNe9nMU,3242240,3247280,yo there's something you got to  understand about training it is not just  the body that's at work there's an
A6OwnNe9nMU,3247280,3255040,integration of mind spirit and body at  play there's a threshold that you have  to cross in order to access the power of
A6OwnNe9nMU,3255040,3261839,the mind and the spirit in your training  lifting barbells isn't just lifting   barbells  lifting barbells is a transformative
A6OwnNe9nMU,3261839,3267280,process that makes you a stronger person  yourself  instantly if you cross this threshold
A6OwnNe9nMU,3267280,3273119,most people are too scared to cross that  threshold  when you cross that threshold you're
A6OwnNe9nMU,3273119,3280880,like breaking through a fortress and  within that fortress there are jewels of  untold value that will instantly turn
A6OwnNe9nMU,3280880,3286799,you to a brand new person a type of  person that wherever you go people will  know that you're not the same people
A6OwnNe9nMU,3286799,3291839,will recognize the newfound power in you  simply by approaching training from the
A6OwnNe9nMU,3291839,3298960,spiritual perspective  that power is only found beyond the
A6OwnNe9nMU,3298960,3304880,threshold that power that's within that  fortress that transforms you instantly  that makes you a stronger version of
A6OwnNe9nMU,3304880,3312640,yourself that everyone sees knows  respects can appreciate  it's found in one place
A6OwnNe9nMU,3312640,3318559,there's a single opportunity in your  workout  to access this gate to move through and
A6OwnNe9nMU,3318559,3325200,transcend yourself  it's found in the last  rep
A6OwnNe9nMU,3325200,3329558,it's called a transcendent wreck
A6OwnNe9nMU,3330620,3335680,[Music]  everything that you've done up until
A6OwnNe9nMU,3335680,3342160,this point  leads to the single sweet spot  and it is here that you grow stronger it
A6OwnNe9nMU,3342160,3347200,is here that champions are born it is  here that you become the strongest  version of yourself
A6OwnNe9nMU,3347200,3353599,everything else is just a warm-up if you  can't be in the flesh  when you approach that transcendent rep
A6OwnNe9nMU,3353599,3360559,that last rest that your body doesn't  want to do  what your mind and your spirit have  already done the body just had to line
A6OwnNe9nMU,3360559,3367119,up  but when you cross that threshold not  only does your body grow stronger  because you did that last rep
A6OwnNe9nMU,3367119,3373359,but there's an alignment there's a unity  that happens between your body your mind  and your spirit only when you're
A6OwnNe9nMU,3373359,3379760,courageous enough to cross that  threshold  that transcendence rather
A6OwnNe9nMU,3379760,3385839,when you put  every ounce of effort energy  commitment discipline into executing
A6OwnNe9nMU,3385839,3391520,that last rep you transcend and you were  born again  you become a brand new person you're
A6OwnNe9nMU,3391520,3398559,resurrected in strength and everywhere  you go from then on out people will  recognize that there's a newfound power
A6OwnNe9nMU,3398559,3404160,in you they can't see you the same way  they won't talk to you the same way they  won't feel you the same way because
A6OwnNe9nMU,3404160,3409760,you're brand new you'll breathe  different you'll walk different the look  in your eyes will be brand new
A6OwnNe9nMU,3409760,3416160,stronger more direct more focused more  confident  they'll all know
A6OwnNe9nMU,3416160,3421000,that there's a brand new stronger you
