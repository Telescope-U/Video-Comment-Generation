Dcyq2UkLUjI,874,1890,(electronic melody)
Dcyq2UkLUjI,1890,5310,"- Hello folks, today is Friday, June 24th, 2022."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,5310,7080,"As usual, my name is Jake Baldino,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,7080,8880,here to talk about all the video game news
Dcyq2UkLUjI,8880,9750,that was going on this week.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,9750,11700,"We got quite a bit, so let's just jump in."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,11700,13110,The first story is pretty exciting.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,13110,15959,"It's the potential follow up to ""Elden Ring"","
Dcyq2UkLUjI,15960,17820,from the developers FromSoftware.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,17820,19860,"We got little tiny, mm, mm, morsels."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,19860,21360,"I'm never gonna do that again, mm, mm."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,21360,23430,"I've said that before in videos, but here we are."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,23430,25040,"Couple of tidbits, the first is that"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,25040,27330,FromSoftware's Twitter and social media accounts
Dcyq2UkLUjI,27330,30900,did tweet out that they are hiring for their next projects.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,30900,33300,"Note, projects with an S, meaning multiple."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,33300,34860,"And also, along with this,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,34860,38760,to kind of back it up is FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki
Dcyq2UkLUjI,38760,41100,doing an interview where he states that their next game
Dcyq2UkLUjI,41100,43859,is actually already in the final stages of development.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,43860,45720,"This is the one that a lot of people are guesstimating,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,45720,47460,we're hoping that it's going to technically be
Dcyq2UkLUjI,47460,49140,"the next ""Armored Core"" game."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,49140,51239,"There's been teases and rumors about that already,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,51240,53310,but also that they are staffing up big time.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,53310,56190,They're paying people more and they have multiple titles
Dcyq2UkLUjI,56190,58289,"by different directors in the works,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,58290,60240,all under the FromSoftware studio.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,60240,61680,"And more ""Elden Ring"" updates are coming,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,61680,63900,so just kind of good news all around.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,63900,66570,"Small, like I said, but very interesting"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,66570,67890,to see what they cook up next.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,67890,69420,"A new ""Armored Core"" thing would be cool."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,69420,72090,"I'd love to see them take on more sci-fi stuff again,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,72090,74490,"but they really could do anything at this point,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,74490,76710,and people are probably at least gonna check it out.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,76710,79170,"I mean, look at the success of ""Elden Ring"", it's insane."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,79170,80995,What if they made a walking simulator?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,80996,82862,(Andy laughing) It'd be so hard.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,82862,83709,(Jake laughing) - It'd be the scariest
Dcyq2UkLUjI,83709,84840,walking simulator.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,84840,87600,"- And in other news, it's that time of year."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,87600,89970,"And by that, I mean, ""Grand Theft Auto 6"" rumors."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,89970,91260,"All the time, we talk about them."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,91260,93450,"Take them all, of course, with a grain of salt."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,93450,96329,But this newest one kind of reiterates and backs up
Dcyq2UkLUjI,96330,97920,some things that we've previously heard.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,97920,102180,"This is from Matheusvictorbr and xfire.com,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,102180,105090,and the main gist is that the game is coming 2024.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,105090,108270,It's going to take place partially in South America
Dcyq2UkLUjI,108270,112259,"and also a North American city, rumored Carcer City,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,112260,115230,which is very interesting if you're into Rockstar Games lore
Dcyq2UkLUjI,115230,117300,"but apparently there are going to be two protagonists,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,117300,119220,"seemingly a brother and sister,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,119220,122700,in kind of like a dueling fates type of crime story.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,122700,124200,I'm not gonna go too much further into it.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,124200,126240,I am gonna link the full story in the description
Dcyq2UkLUjI,126240,128190,"if you want to check it out because like, I always say,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,128190,130140,take this stuff with a grain of salt.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,130140,132360,"But what I really mean by that is like, you know,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,132360,134580,"with every leak and rumor, it's fun to talk about"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,134580,137910,"and discuss, but never invest too much emotion"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,137910,140610,or anything personal into it because who knows.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,140610,141930,And the ideas that have been tossed around
Dcyq2UkLUjI,141930,143430,in a lot of these rumors is kind of
Dcyq2UkLUjI,143430,147569,"a continent spanning crime adventure does sound cool,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,147570,149250,"but, you know, I don't wanna get my hopes up"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,149250,150570,for something where they might be working
Dcyq2UkLUjI,150570,151740,on something completely different.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,151740,153280,"Who knows, the way I look at it is that it's probably still"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,153280,155730,"gonna be a long time anyway so, whatever, dude."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,155730,157319,"Now, piggybacking off of Rockstar Games"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,157320,158970,"and ""Grand Theft Auto"", let's talk about something"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,158970,161580,that I truly loved and I thought was totally underrated.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,161580,164940,"The ""Scarface"" game, dude, that game had no right"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,164940,166050,being as good as it was.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,166050,167220,"- Yeah, yeah. - What a miracle."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,167220,168930,"It was goofy, it was crazy, it was wild."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,168930,171359,A lot of people liked it and that was really it.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,171360,173100,It was a miracle that the game was made.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,173100,175710,It was great that it actually turned out to be pretty fun.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,175710,178050,"And apparently, there was a sequel in the works."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,178050,180720,This comes thanks to Mafia Game Videos
Dcyq2UkLUjI,180720,183180,"for some pretty great work here, unearthing some stuff."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,183180,185159,"So definitely check out his full video,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,185160,186030,highly recommend it.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,186030,187980,Specifically because he does have
Dcyq2UkLUjI,187980,190627,early gameplay footage of it that I don't wanna show here.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,190627,192780,"You know, we don't want to get our video flagged"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,192780,194490,"or taken down, but he's the brave soul"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,194490,196140,who has been unearthing this stuff.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,196140,199537,"And apparently, it is essentially more crazy"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,199537,201487,"""what if"" Scarface stuff."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,201487,203250,"""Scarface"" the game actually took place"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,203250,205770,after the events of the movie where he just survived
Dcyq2UkLUjI,205770,208417,and was pissed and wanted to rebuild his empire.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,208417,212010,"""Scarface 2"" then continues that story where the heat"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,212010,214920,in Florida is too much with all the drug stuff going on.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,214920,218280,"So, he decides to take his business to Las Vegas,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,218280,221580,"and it's basically Tony Montana takes Las Vegas,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,221580,223650,and seems like a really cool idea.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,223650,225569,"Apparently, it just got shelled because at the time,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,225570,228540,Activision was working on too many other open world games
Dcyq2UkLUjI,228540,230819,"at the time, but just the story, it sounds fun."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,230820,232440,"And the way the games worked, they were,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,232440,235560,"in a world of ""Grand Theft Auto"" copycat clones"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,235560,238140,"at that time period, this just embraced the fun"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,238140,239220,and stupidity of it all.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,239220,241110,It was just a fun little third person shooting.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,241110,242640,"Also like, you're looking at something like this."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,242640,244590,"I don't think we're ever gonna actually, like,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,244590,246959,"we're never probably gonna get another ""Scarface"" game."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,246960,248430,So enjoy this while you can.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,248430,249480,"Also, in case you missed it,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,249480,252810,a new triple A game studio has opened.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,252810,256019,"It's founded by some ex-people behind ""The Last of Us"""
Dcyq2UkLUjI,256019,259410,"and ""Days Gone"", this new studio is called Lithos."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,259410,260640,I think that's how you say it.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,260640,263940,And they're talking about their new action open world
Dcyq2UkLUjI,263940,266280,"RPG game called ""Ashfall""."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,266280,267930,"We don't really have much on it, other than"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,267930,269550,that the studio is now established.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,269550,271590,This is their first game they're going to be working on.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,271590,273630,"And like, it does sound ambitious and fun"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,273630,274950,"and it's going to be a single player,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,274950,276600,"but like, shared world experience."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,276600,277920,But it's also going to be integrated
Dcyq2UkLUjI,277920,281730,with Web 3 and the blockchain and NFT stuff.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,281730,284339,"So there's that, the timing couldn't really be worse."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,284339,286590,(laughing) A lot of people aren't into that stuff.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,286590,289290,They have also clarified that this is still going to be
Dcyq2UkLUjI,289290,292230,just a traditional regular game for PC and consoles.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,292230,294150,"But, it's funny that there's an asterisk, right?"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,294150,296759,"It's like, oh, new game from studio veterans"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,296760,299970,"of previous great games, but could just be a money play."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,299970,301020,"I don't know, who knows?"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,301020,303449,"I'm just glad that there is a studio working on a new game,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,303450,305280,so I'll have to just wait and see how it turns out.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,305280,307860,"Hey, next up, this episode is sponsored by Guardio."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,307860,309750,"Do you know anyone that's been hacked,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,309750,312270,"clicked on a phishing link, or just scammed online?"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,312270,314250,"Especially as a gamer, like, have you ever downloaded"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,314250,316020,a weird mod or a map
Dcyq2UkLUjI,316020,318330,or clicked on a sketchy link on Discord?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,318330,319560,You gotta protect where you use
Dcyq2UkLUjI,319560,322110,"your valuable info and gaming accounts, your browser."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,322110,324780,Guardio works overtime with a variety of different features

Dcyq2UkLUjI,327090,328800,"It's an easy, quick install and setup"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,328800,331710,and you get a free security scan right out of the gate
Dcyq2UkLUjI,331710,333449,to see if there are threats on your browser.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,333450,335160,"You know, because some people keep their computers,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,335160,337770,"and sometimes their browsers, a complete mess."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,337770,340680,"Now, from there, you continue with a seven day free trial"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,340680,342120,to remove existing threats
Dcyq2UkLUjI,342120,343860,and to enable real time protection.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,343860,345360,"Now, like I said, if you go with Guardio,"

Dcyq2UkLUjI,348060,350400,but you can also clean up your browser notifications
Dcyq2UkLUjI,350400,352979,and Guardio can identify the sketchy ones for you
Dcyq2UkLUjI,352980,355920,and easily and cleanly notify you of information leaks
Dcyq2UkLUjI,355920,357630,for sites that you're already signed up for.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,357630,358830,"Now, I'm always downloading stuff"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,358830,362250,"on random sites through browsers, for work and for gaming,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,362250,365370,from like old save files to mods to assets.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,365370,367440,So it's just nice that I never have to worry
Dcyq2UkLUjI,367440,369150,about visiting harmful sites.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,369150,373020,"So check it out, go to guard.io/gameranx on screen here"

Dcyq2UkLUjI,379500,381810,"And thanks again to Guardio, for sponsoring this video."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,381810,384990,"Next up, oh man, the ultimate pain that I feel."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,384990,386940,"Now, I made a whole video about this on my channel."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,386940,388680,"So I apologize if I'm repeating myself,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,388680,392610,"but, andyTHPS, the Twitch streamer, did an interview"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,392610,396240,with Tony Hawk the man himself where Tony Hawk actually went
Dcyq2UkLUjI,396240,399419,"into detail saying that Vicarious Visions and Activision,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,399420,403830,"like, there was a plan to make ""Tony Hawk 3 + 4"" remastered"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,403830,405990,"after the success of ""1 + 2"" remastered."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,405990,407280,"As a diehard fan of the series,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,407280,409410,I thought they really cracked the code with the gameplay.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,409410,411930,"It was a perfect rebuilt version of the classic games,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,411930,413759,"and I was excited for a ""3 + 4""."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,413760,415890,"A lot of people were, but he said,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,415890,417540,"you know, because of Vicarious Visions"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,417540,419850,and how it was absorbed into Blizzard
Dcyq2UkLUjI,419850,422820,"to just work on other Activision Blizzard support games,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,422820,423660,it's not gonna happen.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,423660,426330,"Apparently, Activision did also even take pitches"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,426330,429389,"and hear pitches from outside studios, what they would do"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,429390,432030,"for a ""Tony Hawk"" game, but they didn't go for any of them."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,432030,433470,"The cynical side of me would say, oh,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,433470,435630,"probably because they didn't involve, you know,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,435630,437700,any interesting monetization things.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,437700,438870,"But either way, it just sucks."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,438870,440280,"Like, we were this close."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,440280,442650,"We were this close to greatness, but you know,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,442650,444570,"at least out in this world, there is,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,444570,445837,"you know, plenty of great stuff."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,445837,449340,"""OlliOlli World"" is awesome, ""Skater XL""."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,449340,452669,"There are a lot of cool, there's a new ""Skate"" game coming."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,452670,455647,"So those experiences are out there, but that classic style"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,455647,458610,"""Tony Hawk"" gameplay that I have personally invested a lot"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,458610,460860,of my muscle memory into.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,460860,462509,"It's just a bummer, just Activision"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,462510,463800,and business being business.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,463800,466050,"It's, you know, another studio that got absorbed"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,466050,467849,that had great people making great things.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,467850,469710,"Will ""Tony Hawk"" ride again?"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,469710,471240,See what I did there?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,471240,472530,"I don't know, we'll just have to wait and see."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,472530,473970,"Next up, in case you missed it,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,473970,476820,"we actually have a release date, not a game delay."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,476820,479490,"The new ""Plague Tale"" game, ""A Plague Tale: Requiem"""
Dcyq2UkLUjI,479490,482669,"has an official release date of October 18th of this year,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,482670,486060,and a big lengthy gameplay trailer that debuted with it.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,486060,487680,"Now, I actually didn't watch this,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,487680,489720,just because I like the original game so much
Dcyq2UkLUjI,489720,491760,"that I'm like, you know what, I'll play the second one."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,491760,493800,"I'm pretty sold, so I don't need to see"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,493800,495389,"too much more of the game, so I skipped this,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,495390,496830,but let me know if you watched it.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,496830,499229,I'm curious if you're happy with where it's going.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,499230,500910,But I'm glad we're getting some tasty fall games
Dcyq2UkLUjI,500910,502710,"to look forward to, at least."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,502710,505650,"Also, ""No Man's Sky"" is coming to Nintendo Switch"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,505650,507960,"in October, that's pretty cool."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,507960,510240,"Andy is like the resident ""No Man's Sky"" guy."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,510240,511552,Would you play that on Switch?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,511552,512658,"- [Andy] I thought it was already on Switch,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,512658,513719,I'm gonna be totally honest. - I did too.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,513719,514949,You know what it is on?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,514950,516400,- [Andy And Jake] Steam Deck.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,517800,518669,- All this stuff will be linked
Dcyq2UkLUjI,518669,520110,in the description down below.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,520110,522570,"Also releasing this week is ""Sonic Origins"","
Dcyq2UkLUjI,522570,524430,"so, we did a ""Before You Buy"" for that."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,524430,526830,"Falcon took that over 'cause he's, like, the Sonic expert"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,526830,528480,"for the classic games, so."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,528480,530699,"Long story short, it's a pretty nice package."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,530700,531840,"It's a little expensive,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,531840,533730,but it's a good way to replay the classic games.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,533730,534810,"They didn't really screw anything up,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,534810,536760,despite people really kind of doubting SEGA
Dcyq2UkLUjI,536760,538410,sometimes with stuff like this.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,538410,540329,"I'm definitely looking forward to jumping into it,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,540330,541530,"eventually when I have time,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,541530,543720,when I get past all these other games that are releasing.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,543720,545699,"And speaking of that, the game I'm currently working on"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,545700,549150,"for a ""Before You Buy"", ""Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes""."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,549150,550530,"We linked the launch trailer for that,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,550530,551460,if you're curious about that.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,551460,553410,Something new to play on Nintendo Switch this week.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,553410,556440,"But in other news, some possible relief for PC players,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,556440,561090,as it seems like the MSRP prices of graphics cards
Dcyq2UkLUjI,561090,564090,are starting to normalize a little bit.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,564090,567641,"This has been connected apparently because of the crypto,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,567641,570270,"NFT crashes that have been happening lately,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,570270,573240,"making mining less of a profitable thing, so."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,573240,575610,People are apparently offloading tons of graphics cards
Dcyq2UkLUjI,575610,577320,"and, really, their availability"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,577320,579120,is also just getting a little better.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,579120,581430,"I've seen memes, I've seen images passed around"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,581430,584130,of stocked shelves of GPUs.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,584130,586680,"I personally myself haven't seen that yet,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,586680,588750,but it's something kind of nice.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,588750,590670,"Especially considering, like, we've talked"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,590670,593220,"a lot about this, but even with console manufacturers"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,593220,594449,"still saying it out there,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,594450,596160,that like this whole chip shortage
Dcyq2UkLUjI,596160,599759,manufacturing worldwide issue is still going to continue
Dcyq2UkLUjI,599760,600593,"for a little bit, you know,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,600593,602130,seemingly past this holiday season
Dcyq2UkLUjI,602130,603690,is what I've seen most recently.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,603690,605880,"So, if there's at least a little bit of wiggle room now"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,605880,607710,with graphics cards that helps.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,607710,610740,I know a lot of people that are sitting on a fried GPU
Dcyq2UkLUjI,610740,613410,but still don't wanna pony up all the cash for a new one
Dcyq2UkLUjI,613410,615149,'cause it has been pretty bad out there.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,615150,616560,But hopefully now this is the start
Dcyq2UkLUjI,616560,618120,of a light at the end of the tunnel.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,618120,620400,Oh and one other last fun video game history story
Dcyq2UkLUjI,620400,623880,I wanted to talk about is the fact that SEGA programmer
Dcyq2UkLUjI,623880,627020,"Yuji Naka seemingly just tweeted out the fact that,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,627020,630030,"or the confirmation, that ""Sonic 3"" soundtrack"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,630030,632610,was composed partially by Michael Jackson.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,632610,635700,That's always been like the rumor swirling around for years.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,635700,639000,"And the whole thing with this new ""Sonic Origins"" collection"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,639000,641040,is that they don't have all the songs.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,641040,642329,"They didn't have the rights to all the songs,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,642330,645480,"so some of the songs were replaced with prototype songs,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,645480,646920,"which apparently some of them are okay,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,646920,648060,some of them not really.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,648060,650400,"But Yuji Naka essentially put out a tweet saying like,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,650400,653190,"oh, wow, they finally confirmed it."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,653190,655950,"But, he also then started to walk back those tweets"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,655950,658320,"because, like, he was technically commenting on"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,658320,661860,a social media SEGA post using a Michael Jackson song
Dcyq2UkLUjI,661860,664260,"which may be unrelated, may not be,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,664260,666810,but he did walk it back saying his tweets were
Dcyq2UkLUjI,666810,668490,kind of misunderstood.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,668490,670290,"But still, I think for a lot of people"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,670290,673350,"who just always, you know, took stock in that rumor"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,673350,674670,"as a young person, like,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,674670,676500,"which it also just kind of totally makes sense,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,676500,678420,if you look at the whole thing around it.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,678420,679529,"I just thought this was interesting,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,679530,681630,"and now I'm looking and I'm like, what's the deal?"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,681630,682860,What's the real story?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,682860,684959,Is that the closest we have to the real story?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,684960,686940,Or was this just a oopsy whoopsy tweet?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,686940,687880,"- Oopsy doopsies! - Oopsy whoopsy,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,687880,689430,oopsy doopsies!
Dcyq2UkLUjI,689430,691649,"If you think about it, every tweet is a whoopsy."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,691650,694140,But I will link that story and his follow up statements
Dcyq2UkLUjI,694140,696330,in the description if you want it explained.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,696330,699120,"It is really fascinating stuff, so, yeah."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,699120,700650,"Video games, the history behind them,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,700650,702270,"and the story of how they they're made,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,702270,704160,"like, never ceases to amaze me."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,704160,705449,I guess that's why I'm doing this.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,705450,707850,"But, that's all the news stuff going on this week."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,707850,709649,"So I definitely wanna hear from you guys,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,709650,711000,what you think about all the stories.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,711000,713340,"Specifically, the ""GTA 6"" rumors."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,713340,714173,"What do you think, man?"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,714173,715800,"Bullshit, more hearsay,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,715800,717930,or are the puzzle pieces starting to line up?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,717930,721020,Are you like Charlie with all the conspiracy
Dcyq2UkLUjI,721020,722490,Pepe Silvia stuff behind you?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,722490,723810,What do you think about that canceled
Dcyq2UkLUjI,723810,726180,"2008 ""Scarface 2"" game?"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,726180,728580,"I would've played the hell out of that, dude."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,728580,730770,"Are you like me, are you as upset,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,730770,731970,"butt hurt, if you will,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,731970,735360,"about the fact that we almost got a ""Tony Hawk 3 + 4"" remake"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,735360,736589,and now we don't?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,736590,740070,"Also, in terms of FromSoftware's new game,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,740070,741090,"what do you think they're working,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,741090,743400,"well, really, what would you like to see them work on?"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,743400,744660,What type of genre?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,744660,747000,What type of setting would you like them to tackle?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,747000,749460,Would you like to see them do just a similar style
Dcyq2UkLUjI,749460,751260,"FromSoftware game, but like in a new world"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,751260,753690,"or a new time period or, you know, what do you want?"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,753690,755130,Are you gonna play that NFT game?
Dcyq2UkLUjI,755130,757080,Let's talk about (laughing) any of this stuff
Dcyq2UkLUjI,757080,758970,"down in the comments, definitely wanna hear from you."
Dcyq2UkLUjI,758970,760199,Things get a little crazy down there.
Dcyq2UkLUjI,760200,761910,"We're gonna be down there, but things get crazy,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,761910,763440,"so if you wanna yell at me directly,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,763440,765932,"of course, you can always find me on Twitter and Instagram,"
Dcyq2UkLUjI,765932,767190,@JakeBaldino.
