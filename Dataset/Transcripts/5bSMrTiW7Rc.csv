5bSMrTiW7Rc,267360,269280,league defense is
5bSMrTiW7Rc,269280,271040,because the fact that this results in no
5bSMrTiW7Rc,271040,272960,outs is nuts
5bSMrTiW7Rc,272960,275120,uh the second baseman was shifting he
5bSMrTiW7Rc,275120,277199,could have went to third
5bSMrTiW7Rc,277199,279360,to get the force
5bSMrTiW7Rc,279360,280639,yeah what's going on here why didn't he
5bSMrTiW7Rc,280639,282000,go to third to get the force was the
5bSMrTiW7Rc,282000,283120,third baseman on there the third
5bSMrTiW7Rc,283120,285280,baseman's there at this point wait why
5bSMrTiW7Rc,285280,286720,didn't he just throw it to third to get
5bSMrTiW7Rc,286720,288720,the force he still thinks the double
5bSMrTiW7Rc,288720,290720,plays in order and then he looks up and
5bSMrTiW7Rc,290720,292960,the second baseman's nowhere to be found
5bSMrTiW7Rc,292960,294720,he still has time to turn and throw to
5bSMrTiW7Rc,294720,297199,third here to get the he stole so much
5bSMrTiW7Rc,297199,298479,time
5bSMrTiW7Rc,298479,300000,oh i didn't realize this was such a bad
5bSMrTiW7Rc,300000,300960,play
5bSMrTiW7Rc,300960,302560,and then he goes to first and that guy's
5bSMrTiW7Rc,302560,304400,safe and they're safe all around and
5bSMrTiW7Rc,304400,306400,he's like wait what the hell just
5bSMrTiW7Rc,306400,308000,happened and now they're starting to get
5bSMrTiW7Rc,308000,310479,worried these tennessee fans
5bSMrTiW7Rc,310479,312400,i didn't volunteer for this
5bSMrTiW7Rc,312400,313680,oh no
5bSMrTiW7Rc,313680,316080,that one's put in play two more runs are
5bSMrTiW7Rc,316080,317440,gonna score
5bSMrTiW7Rc,317440,320240,the ball comes in they catch it two runs
5bSMrTiW7Rc,320240,322800,score and now we got ourselves a three
5bSMrTiW7Rc,322800,326400,run game swinging a miss 0-1 swinging a
5bSMrTiW7Rc,326400,329840,miss owen 2 and swinging a miss 0-3 so
5bSMrTiW7Rc,329840,331680,there's two outs now
5bSMrTiW7Rc,331680,334320,there's two outs the tying run is at the
5bSMrTiW7Rc,334320,337759,plate and guess what he does he walks
5bSMrTiW7Rc,337759,340400,them which means bases are gonna be
5bSMrTiW7Rc,340400,342479,loaded
5bSMrTiW7Rc,342479,346000,and now a home run would be
5bSMrTiW7Rc,346000,348960,a walk off home run
5bSMrTiW7Rc,348960,351759,is that what i'm seeing
