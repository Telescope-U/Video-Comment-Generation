U5bijOlB-4I,80,2720,history is full of iconic rivalries in
U5bijOlB-4I,2720,4400,the sports world there's stuff like red
U5bijOlB-4I,4400,7520,sox vs yankees unc versus duke ohio
U5bijOlB-4I,7520,9599,state versus michigan in pop culture
U5bijOlB-4I,9599,12080,there's edward versus jacob bts vs
U5bijOlB-4I,12080,14240,blackpink team captain america versus
U5bijOlB-4I,14240,16880,team iron man left shark versus right
U5bijOlB-4I,16880,18800,shark even in the food world there's
U5bijOlB-4I,18800,20640,rivalries with the likes of coke versus
U5bijOlB-4I,20640,23039,pepsi and taco bell versus your bowels
U5bijOlB-4I,23039,25119,but of all these bitter rivalries one
U5bijOlB-4I,25119,27039,stands out as being the sweetest of the
U5bijOlB-4I,27039,30160,bunch left twix versus right twix each
U5bijOlB-4I,30160,32320,factory took a vastly different approach
U5bijOlB-4I,32320,34640,left to explode caramel on cookie while
U5bijOlB-4I,34640,37280,right twix cascaded caramel on cookie
U5bijOlB-4I,37280,39360,try both and pick a side for the past
U5bijOlB-4I,39360,41120,decade twix's marketing is centered
U5bijOlB-4I,41120,42879,around the different non-differences
U5bijOlB-4I,42879,44719,between the left half of twix bars and
U5bijOlB-4I,44719,46800,the right half all while asking us to
U5bijOlB-4I,46800,49039,pick a side well today we're gonna do
U5bijOlB-4I,49039,51760,exactly that i'm gonna prove using data
U5bijOlB-4I,51760,54480,and science which side is indisputably
U5bijOlB-4I,54480,59640,the correct side of the twix bar
U5bijOlB-4I,70720,73600,hello internet welcome to food theory
U5bijOlB-4I,73600,75600,the show that chooses violence and eats
U5bijOlB-4I,75600,77920,both twix at the same time does that
U5bijOlB-4I,77920,79920,average out to make me middle twix so at
U5bijOlB-4I,79920,81360,this point you get the basic conceit of
U5bijOlB-4I,81360,83040,the episode twix bars are some of the
U5bijOlB-4I,83040,84799,best candy bars available on the market
U5bijOlB-4I,84799,86720,strip a cookie caramel on top covered in
U5bijOlB-4I,86720,88479,chocolate there are two twix bars in
U5bijOlB-4I,88479,90479,every package of twix they should be
U5bijOlB-4I,90479,92720,identical to each other they probably
U5bijOlB-4I,92720,94640,are identical to each other and yet
U5bijOlB-4I,94640,96560,their marketing campaigns for the past
U5bijOlB-4I,96560,98720,decade have made a big deal about
U5bijOlB-4I,98720,100880,choosing sides are you a left twix
U5bijOlB-4I,100880,103119,person or a right twix person i
U5bijOlB-4I,103119,104720,technically don't really keep friends
U5bijOlB-4I,104720,106159,from right twigs there's something
U5bijOlB-4I,106159,107840,really off about those guys they've even
U5bijOlB-4I,107840,109520,gone so far as to create a lengthy
U5bijOlB-4I,109520,111840,backstory behind the rivalry years ago
U5bijOlB-4I,111840,113360,when the inventors sheamus and earl
U5bijOlB-4I,113360,115280,unveiled their twix bar the tension
U5bijOlB-4I,115280,117759,between them reached a breaking point
U5bijOlB-4I,117759,119520,literally to this day sharing nothing
U5bijOlB-4I,119520,120799,but a rapper
U5bijOlB-4I,120799,123200,and an ill-designed driveway then they
U5bijOlB-4I,123200,124719,hired mercenaries to fight their
U5bijOlB-4I,124719,127040,brothers mercenaries now obviously this
U5bijOlB-4I,127040,129200,is all a joke right a big ol sarcastic
U5bijOlB-4I,129200,130959,trust us the left and right sides are
U5bijOlB-4I,130959,132879,totally different wink wink i mean
U5bijOlB-4I,132879,134879,obviously this thing isn't serious if it
U5bijOlB-4I,134879,136879,was they'd bother to keep their facts
U5bijOlB-4I,136879,139120,straight originally right twix was
U5bijOlB-4I,139120,141520,cascaded with caramel see left twix
U5bijOlB-4I,141520,143840,float caramel on cookie while right twix
U5bijOlB-4I,143840,146160,cascaded caramel on cookie but later in
U5bijOlB-4I,146160,148400,the campaign it actually switches is
U5bijOlB-4I,148400,149599,there to try one of these bars made over
U5bijOlB-4I,149599,151680,our right twix why
U5bijOlB-4I,151680,153440,our special cookie is cascaded with
U5bijOlB-4I,153440,156160,caramel and cloaked in chocolate no no
U5bijOlB-4I,156160,159920,sir no left twix flows caramel and
U5bijOlB-4I,159920,162400,bathes in chocolate keep your story
U5bijOlB-4I,162400,164239,straight twix it's almost like no one
U5bijOlB-4I,164239,166160,cares about the consistency of their own
U5bijOlB-4I,166160,168560,lore unless of course he's secretly an
U5bijOlB-4I,168560,170720,undercover agent from right twix posing
U5bijOlB-4I,170720,174160,as a left twix employee
U5bijOlB-4I,177440,179440,no no that's not a real thing i just
U5bijOlB-4I,179440,181040,care about this way more than they did
U5bijOlB-4I,181040,183519,but what if what if the whole left twix
U5bijOlB-4I,183519,185440,versus right twix thing isn't
U5bijOlB-4I,185440,187120,tongue-in-cheek but if this whole thing
U5bijOlB-4I,187120,189200,isn't cloaked in sarcasm and bathed in
U5bijOlB-4I,189200,190800,marketing hype when you're choosing a
U5bijOlB-4I,190800,193120,twix which team should you choose to be
U5bijOlB-4I,193120,195440,on between left and right twix which one
U5bijOlB-4I,195440,198000,is the better twix i guarantee that by
U5bijOlB-4I,198000,199760,the end of the episode you will have an
U5bijOlB-4I,199760,201760,answer and there's only one way to find
U5bijOlB-4I,201760,203760,it out buying an egregious amount of
U5bijOlB-4I,203760,205680,candy bars and then aggressively
U5bijOlB-4I,205680,207920,performing science on them so before we
U5bijOlB-4I,207920,209440,go any further we need to establish our
U5bijOlB-4I,209440,211120,terms because let me tell ya things are
U5bijOlB-4I,211120,212640,gonna get confusing in a hurry for the
U5bijOlB-4I,212640,214560,purposes of today when i say a twix bar
U5bijOlB-4I,214560,216239,i'm talking about an individual stick of
U5bijOlB-4I,216239,218400,cookie dabbled with caramel and snuggled
U5bijOlB-4I,218400,220720,in chocolate there are two twix bars in
U5bijOlB-4I,220720,222959,a single packet so that's the basics but
U5bijOlB-4I,222959,224480,the bigger question how do you tell the
U5bijOlB-4I,224480,226080,difference between left and right when
U5bijOlB-4I,226080,228000,the packaging has the bar's name written
U5bijOlB-4I,228000,229920,horizontally thereby making this more of
U5bijOlB-4I,229920,232319,a top versus bottom kind of thing well
U5bijOlB-4I,232319,233439,as we see in the commercials the
U5bijOlB-4I,233439,235040,definitive way of opening a package of
U5bijOlB-4I,235040,237040,twix is with the word twix reading from
U5bijOlB-4I,237040,238720,the bottom up so when you're looking at
U5bijOlB-4I,238720,240319,a standard package of twix in a
U5bijOlB-4I,240319,243120,supermarket line top twix is left twix
U5bijOlB-4I,243120,245599,and bottom twix is right twix you got
U5bijOlB-4I,245599,248159,all that great now throw it out the
U5bijOlB-4I,248159,250319,window you see that's the way things
U5bijOlB-4I,250319,252720,should be if the universe didn't hate me
U5bijOlB-4I,252720,254799,but life always has a way of making
U5bijOlB-4I,254799,256560,these episodes more complicated than
U5bijOlB-4I,256560,258479,they should be knowing that i wanted an
U5bijOlB-4I,258479,261280,adequate sample size we bought 208 twix
U5bijOlB-4I,261280,264479,bars and then we opened the boxes and a
U5bijOlB-4I,264479,267199,slow dread passed over me as i realized
U5bijOlB-4I,267199,269120,that the wrappers are now labeled as
U5bijOlB-4I,269120,271520,containing two left twix or containing
U5bijOlB-4I,271520,275199,two right twix because life is pain you
U5bijOlB-4I,275199,277199,see the problem here right this adds yet
U5bijOlB-4I,277199,279199,another layer of confusion to the
U5bijOlB-4I,279199,280800,question not only do we now have to
U5bijOlB-4I,280800,281919,figure out if there's a difference
U5bijOlB-4I,281919,283600,between the left and right bars inside
U5bijOlB-4I,283600,285680,of an individual packet but now we also
U5bijOlB-4I,285680,287440,have to factor in whether the twix
U5bijOlB-4I,287440,289600,packaged as right twixes and the ones
U5bijOlB-4I,289600,292240,labeled as left twixes actually differ
U5bijOlB-4I,292240,294560,in any meaningful way so with that in
U5bijOlB-4I,294560,297199,mind i had to label all of my twix as
U5bijOlB-4I,297199,299759,left to left left right right left or
U5bijOlB-4I,299759,301759,right right taking into account both the
U5bijOlB-4I,301759,303919,name on the packaging as well as the
U5bijOlB-4I,303919,306560,side of the packet they're on and just
U5bijOlB-4I,306560,309039,as a friendly reminder this was meant to
U5bijOlB-4I,309039,311360,be a dumb episode a fun one just for the
U5bijOlB-4I,311360,313199,lols but instead it's becoming more
U5bijOlB-4I,313199,315039,complicated than trying to solve for
U5bijOlB-4I,315039,317039,mario's height you know how sometimes on
U5bijOlB-4I,317039,318960,this channel i get mid video regret
U5bijOlB-4I,318960,320639,syndrome about the episode topics i've
U5bijOlB-4I,320639,323199,selected yep this is that point a series
U5bijOlB-4I,323199,325360,of frustrated head desks later it was
U5bijOlB-4I,325360,327440,data time i needed to find the cold hard
U5bijOlB-4I,327440,329280,differences between left twix and right
U5bijOlB-4I,329280,331520,twix so that i could as the advertising
U5bijOlB-4I,331520,333600,suggested choose a side as such i
U5bijOlB-4I,333600,335919,devised a few tests first and easiest
U5bijOlB-4I,335919,337600,was a simple weight test pop them on the
U5bijOlB-4I,337600,339680,scale and see what it spits out second
U5bijOlB-4I,339680,341680,was a crunchiness test maybe something
U5bijOlB-4I,341680,343039,with the packaging renders one of the
U5bijOlB-4I,343039,345120,bars a bit more stale than the other and
U5bijOlB-4I,345120,347199,finally a taste test give random
U5bijOlB-4I,347199,348960,strangers a blind taste test of a bunch
U5bijOlB-4I,348960,350800,of twix bars to see what trends pop up
U5bijOlB-4I,350800,353120,in the data and then maybe maybe i'd be
U5bijOlB-4I,353120,355039,able to draw some conclusions about the
U5bijOlB-4I,355039,358000,optimal twix experience first wait twix
U5bijOlB-4I,358000,361680,bars average between 24.5 and 25.5 grams
U5bijOlB-4I,361680,364080,and any deviation from that was very
U5bijOlB-4I,364080,366240,rare out of the 208 bars that we weighed
U5bijOlB-4I,366240,368240,only 10 fell outside of the range which
U5bijOlB-4I,368240,370319,hey kudos to mars incorporated quality
U5bijOlB-4I,370319,372560,control game is on point the biggest
U5bijOlB-4I,372560,375280,outlier was a monstrous 27 gram thick
U5bijOlB-4I,375280,376639,boy with pretty much all the extra
U5bijOlB-4I,376639,378319,weight coming from a larger volume of
U5bijOlB-4I,378319,380880,caramel so was this a right bar or a
U5bijOlB-4I,380880,383759,left bar it was a left twix coming out
U5bijOlB-4I,383759,386479,of a package labeled two right twix they
U5bijOlB-4I,386479,387919,ask you how you are you just have to say
U5bijOlB-4I,387919,389440,that you're fine when you're not really
U5bijOlB-4I,389440,391199,fine of the other overweight bars five
U5bijOlB-4I,391199,393360,of them came out of left twix packages
U5bijOlB-4I,393360,395440,with two specifically being left left
U5bijOlB-4I,395440,396880,bars among the twix that were
U5bijOlB-4I,396880,398800,underweight both of them came from right
U5bijOlB-4I,398800,400639,twix packages but one was from the left
U5bijOlB-4I,400639,402560,side and one was from the right side
U5bijOlB-4I,402560,403840,when you do the math it works out like
U5bijOlB-4I,403840,405520,this the average weight of twix on the
U5bijOlB-4I,405520,408479,right side of the package 25.0
U5bijOlB-4I,408479,410880,grams the twix on the left side of the
U5bijOlB-4I,410880,412759,package
U5bijOlB-4I,412759,416160,25.04 grams basically no difference but
U5bijOlB-4I,416160,417360,maybe instead of looking at where in the
U5bijOlB-4I,417360,418720,pack of the twix came from we should
U5bijOlB-4I,418720,420800,just trust what the label tells us twix
U5bijOlB-4I,420800,423199,that came from packets labeled left twix
U5bijOlB-4I,423199,426240,averaged out at 25.05 grams while twix
U5bijOlB-4I,426240,428240,coming out of two right twix packages
U5bijOlB-4I,428240,431280,averaged out to 25.02 grams that is a
U5bijOlB-4I,431280,434000,0.03 gram per bar difference for left
U5bijOlB-4I,434000,437360,twix 0.06 grams in a packet so a slight
U5bijOlB-4I,437360,439440,edge for left twix but still it's
U5bijOlB-4I,439440,441280,practically a rounding error go figure
U5bijOlB-4I,441280,442479,it's almost like they're meant to be
U5bijOlB-4I,442479,444240,identical so the next thing i wanted to
U5bijOlB-4I,444240,446479,try was crunchiness which to me served
U5bijOlB-4I,446479,448400,as an indicator of freshness i've used a
U5bijOlB-4I,448400,450000,decibel meter for a couple episodes now
U5bijOlB-4I,450000,451280,we used it for trying to create the
U5bijOlB-4I,451280,452960,crunchiest chip episode here on food
U5bijOlB-4I,452960,454479,theory and film theory we used it to
U5bijOlB-4I,454479,456160,test out the survival techniques of a
U5bijOlB-4I,456160,458160,quiet place so yeah we got it why not
U5bijOlB-4I,458160,459759,eat some twix in front of it i took
U5bijOlB-4I,459759,462400,three bites of 16 bars with four from
U5bijOlB-4I,462400,464240,each category being represented i
U5bijOlB-4I,464240,466319,expected literally nothing to come out
U5bijOlB-4I,466319,467759,of this but the differences that i found
U5bijOlB-4I,467759,469599,actually wound up being shocking bars
U5bijOlB-4I,469599,471440,and packages marked right twix wound up
U5bijOlB-4I,471440,472800,being slightly louder than their
U5bijOlB-4I,472800,474560,counterparts in the left twix sleeves
U5bijOlB-4I,474560,477039,but only by a little bit a 1.4 decibel
U5bijOlB-4I,477039,479120,difference nothing major however there
U5bijOlB-4I,479120,480960,was a noticeable difference between the
U5bijOlB-4I,480960,483840,left and right twix in the same package
U5bijOlB-4I,483840,486120,bars on the left of the packet averaged
U5bijOlB-4I,486120,488800,72.3 decibels which was noticeably
U5bijOlB-4I,488800,491039,louder than the 69.6 decibels coming
U5bijOlB-4I,491039,493360,from bars on the right it was nearly a
U5bijOlB-4I,493360,495680,three decibel swing wait a minute we we
U5bijOlB-4I,495680,497039,found a difference we found a
U5bijOlB-4I,497039,498800,significant difference this episode
U5bijOlB-4I,498800,501280,wasn't a waste of time well human error
U5bijOlB-4I,501280,502879,is certainly an x factor that could
U5bijOlB-4I,502879,504800,explain these three decibels i did my
U5bijOlB-4I,504800,506000,best to try and keep the bytes
U5bijOlB-4I,506000,507919,consistent and sample enough to try and
U5bijOlB-4I,507919,509759,make it fair no i suspect that the three
U5bijOlB-4I,509759,511280,decimal difference might actually have
U5bijOlB-4I,511280,513360,to do with the packaging or storage of
U5bijOlB-4I,513360,516399,the twix in fact my hypothesis my food
U5bijOlB-4I,516399,518880,hypothesis is that it all relates less
U5bijOlB-4I,518880,520880,to the left versus right difference and
U5bijOlB-4I,520880,523039,more to the top versus bottom placement
U5bijOlB-4I,523039,524560,that i talked about earlier when on
U5bijOlB-4I,524560,526399,store shelves or slotted into a shipping
U5bijOlB-4I,526399,528320,box one twix is always gonna be sitting
U5bijOlB-4I,528320,530560,on top of another because of the way the
U5bijOlB-4I,530560,532720,package is printed the one on top
U5bijOlB-4I,532720,534640,becomes the left twix in our experiment
U5bijOlB-4I,534640,536880,today which wound up being the noisier
U5bijOlB-4I,536880,539200,of the two groups so being on top is
U5bijOlB-4I,539200,540959,potentially doing something to keep the
U5bijOlB-4I,540959,542959,bar fresher and crunchier maybe it's
U5bijOlB-4I,542959,545120,exposed to less light or maybe less air
U5bijOlB-4I,545120,547200,maybe residual moisture is being caught
U5bijOlB-4I,547200,548640,in the bottom of the package while the
U5bijOlB-4I,548640,550880,top is able to stay nice and dry not
U5bijOlB-4I,550880,553760,entirely sure but for a crisper snap
U5bijOlB-4I,553760,556640,left twix seems to be the quantitative
U5bijOlB-4I,556640,558880,winner finally came the real test the
U5bijOlB-4I,558880,560880,taste test asking a number of friends
U5bijOlB-4I,560880,563040,associates and random strangers to eat
U5bijOlB-4I,563040,564480,candy while i stare at him and take
U5bijOlB-4I,564480,566320,notes i made sure to unwrap the twix
U5bijOlB-4I,566320,568080,before serving it to him to not bias
U5bijOlB-4I,568080,570080,anyone with a left twix or right twix
U5bijOlB-4I,570080,571600,wrapper instead i thought it was a
U5bijOlB-4I,571600,573200,better idea to walk around carrying
U5bijOlB-4I,573200,575279,ziploc baggies full of unwrapped candy
U5bijOlB-4I,575279,577600,bars marked with strange symbols also i
U5bijOlB-4I,577600,579200,was driving around in a windowless white
U5bijOlB-4I,579200,581279,van on an unrelated note i'm now on a
U5bijOlB-4I,581279,583040,couple of government watch lists for
U5bijOlB-4I,583040,585519,science and what did my class a felony
U5bijOlB-4I,585519,588399,get me nothing to my surprise there was
U5bijOlB-4I,588399,590000,no surprise and by that i mean there was
U5bijOlB-4I,590000,591600,no clear preference between left or
U5bijOlB-4I,591600,593120,right twix no matter how you were
U5bijOlB-4I,593120,596000,defining left or right twix no trend no
U5bijOlB-4I,596000,598959,difference except there was one key data
U5bijOlB-4I,598959,600959,point that stood out like a sore thumb
U5bijOlB-4I,600959,602959,people's preference had nothing to do
U5bijOlB-4I,602959,605120,with left versus right but it had
U5bijOlB-4I,605120,607360,everything to do with which bar they
U5bijOlB-4I,607360,610720,selected first in a whopping 85 of our
U5bijOlB-4I,610720,612720,tests the subject reported that the twix
U5bijOlB-4I,612720,615200,bar they ate first tasted better than
U5bijOlB-4I,615200,617360,the second which comes with a shocking
U5bijOlB-4I,617360,619040,takeaway for twix you guys don't need
U5bijOlB-4I,619040,621519,two bars forget left versus right twix
U5bijOlB-4I,621519,623279,you're trying too hard just give people
U5bijOlB-4I,623279,625200,one the first is apparently more than
U5bijOlB-4I,625200,627279,enough honestly it's kind of ironic
U5bijOlB-4I,627279,629279,considering twix's old marketing slogan
U5bijOlB-4I,629279,633240,the one that i grew up with
U5bijOlB-4I,633760,635360,yep encouraging the kids of my
U5bijOlB-4I,635360,637200,generation to be outright terrible to
U5bijOlB-4I,637200,638800,each other so that they can have more
U5bijOlB-4I,638800,641040,candy except as our data just showed we
U5bijOlB-4I,641040,642880,actually don't want more candy the
U5bijOlB-4I,642880,644640,second part is always gonna taste far
U5bijOlB-4I,644640,646720,inferior to the first maybe instead of
U5bijOlB-4I,646720,648640,selfishly hoarding both bars like some
U5bijOlB-4I,648640,650640,sort of greedy chocolate dragon you
U5bijOlB-4I,650640,652320,instead share that second twix and get
U5bijOlB-4I,652320,654560,yourself this sweet taste of altruism or
U5bijOlB-4I,654560,656079,twix maybe you save some money and give
U5bijOlB-4I,656079,657839,the people what they really are asking
U5bijOlB-4I,657839,660000,for less of your candy our data in this
U5bijOlB-4I,660000,662000,test actually supports existing research
U5bijOlB-4I,662000,663760,in the field something called sensory
U5bijOlB-4I,663760,666240,specific satiety or triple s if you want
U5bijOlB-4I,666240,667920,to make it sound like a cheap vin diesel
U5bijOlB-4I,667920,669600,rip-off it's the scientific term for the
U5bijOlB-4I,669600,671600,human experience of enjoying food less
U5bijOlB-4I,671600,673440,the more of it we eat part of this is
U5bijOlB-4I,673440,674959,diminishing returns as we get less
U5bijOlB-4I,674959,676320,enjoyment from the things that you get
U5bijOlB-4I,676320,678240,but sensory specific satiety actually
U5bijOlB-4I,678240,680240,goes way beyond that an oxford study
U5bijOlB-4I,680240,681839,found that your desire for the specific
U5bijOlB-4I,681839,683360,types of food you're eating drops
U5bijOlB-4I,683360,685120,significantly faster than for other
U5bijOlB-4I,685120,687120,types of uneaten food studies done on
U5bijOlB-4I,687120,688640,the pathways in a monkey's brain showed
U5bijOlB-4I,688640,690560,that as it ate certain neural pathways
U5bijOlB-4I,690560,692000,to the monkey's hypothalamus that's the
U5bijOlB-4I,692000,693120,part of the brain that controls your
U5bijOlB-4I,693120,695120,appetite became less responsive when the
U5bijOlB-4I,695120,696959,monkey saw food that it had recently
U5bijOlB-4I,696959,698640,eaten but it would become more
U5bijOlB-4I,698640,701519,responsive when it saw new uneaten food
U5bijOlB-4I,701519,702959,bringing things all the way back around
U5bijOlB-4I,702959,704800,to our original question which is better
U5bijOlB-4I,704800,707040,left twix or right twix well if you're
U5bijOlB-4I,707040,708720,looking to maximize your enjoyment
U5bijOlB-4I,708720,711279,choose left twix first not only was it
U5bijOlB-4I,711279,713200,shown to be the slightly fresher bar but
U5bijOlB-4I,713200,714480,choosing it first means that you're
U5bijOlB-4I,714480,716240,getting the best bites when you're most
U5bijOlB-4I,716240,718480,eager to be eating the candy but again
U5bijOlB-4I,718480,720240,shocking literally no one the difference
U5bijOlB-4I,720240,722000,here is mostly in the marketing these
U5bijOlB-4I,722000,723600,two things are made to be identical
U5bijOlB-4I,723600,725440,which leaves us asking the big question
U5bijOlB-4I,725440,727360,of why why go to the effort of taking
U5bijOlB-4I,727360,729040,two identical food products and giving
U5bijOlB-4I,729040,731200,them two separate labels i mean twix is
U5bijOlB-4I,731200,733600,basically advertising against itself why
U5bijOlB-4I,733600,736000,does this work how does this work does
U5bijOlB-4I,736000,737519,this work well like so much of
U5bijOlB-4I,737519,738720,advertising it all comes down to
U5bijOlB-4I,738720,740560,psychology and the tricks that marketers
U5bijOlB-4I,740560,742639,can play to get into your brain there's
U5bijOlB-4I,742639,744480,a phenomenon called choice supportive
U5bijOlB-4I,744480,746959,bias or post-purchase rationalization
U5bijOlB-4I,746959,748560,which is the tendency of people to come
U5bijOlB-4I,748560,750240,up with justifications to support the
U5bijOlB-4I,750240,751440,choices that they're making in their
U5bijOlB-4I,751440,752720,life whenever people are forced to
U5bijOlB-4I,752720,754160,decide between two or more different
U5bijOlB-4I,754160,755600,products when making a purchase they're
U5bijOlB-4I,755600,757200,more likely to ascribe positive
U5bijOlB-4I,757200,758880,attributes and associate positive
U5bijOlB-4I,758880,760720,feelings with the product that they just
U5bijOlB-4I,760720,762560,bought it's basically the opposite of
U5bijOlB-4I,762560,764320,buyer's remorse we want to convince
U5bijOlB-4I,764320,765920,ourselves that we made the right choice
U5bijOlB-4I,765920,767920,our money wasn't wasted in fact this
U5bijOlB-4I,767920,769279,happens all the time even when the
U5bijOlB-4I,769279,771120,choice is a complete illusion and we're
U5bijOlB-4I,771120,772959,choosing between two identical products
U5bijOlB-4I,772959,774800,one of the big reasons that lotteries
U5bijOlB-4I,774800,776399,let you control which numbers that you
U5bijOlB-4I,776399,778240,pick even though you're just as well off
U5bijOlB-4I,778240,780320,with a completely random lottery ticket
U5bijOlB-4I,780320,782480,giving people the ability to choose even
U5bijOlB-4I,782480,784480,if it's a false or artificial choice
U5bijOlB-4I,784480,786880,gives them a feeling of control whenever
U5bijOlB-4I,786880,788480,you bite into that twix bar whether it
U5bijOlB-4I,788480,790720,was a right or a left twix what you're
U5bijOlB-4I,790720,792480,experiencing while chewing is the result
U5bijOlB-4I,792480,794320,of a decision that you just made which
U5bijOlB-4I,794320,795680,motivates your brain to come up with
U5bijOlB-4I,795680,797920,justifications for why this twix bar is
U5bijOlB-4I,797920,799839,actually delicious and why you're so
U5bijOlB-4I,799839,801600,smart for having made the decision that
U5bijOlB-4I,801600,804160,you just did speaking of smart decisions
