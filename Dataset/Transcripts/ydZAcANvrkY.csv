ydZAcANvrkY,480,6320,When you look for the word first in the bible  you find this teaching you go first to God with  
ydZAcANvrkY,6320,13360,your problems we don't take our problems first to  the bar we don't numb our fears with narcotics we  
ydZAcANvrkY,13360,21039,don't deny the existence of our struggles no  we take our problems first to Christ he said  
ydZAcANvrkY,21040,27760,seek first the kingdom and his righteousness and  look all these things will be given to you as well  
ydZAcANvrkY,28640,33600,would you like some advice to take into this year  that will save you from a month of heartaches  
ydZAcANvrkY,34800,42239,go first to God with your problems the moment  a problem surfaces is the moment you take  
ydZAcANvrkY,42240,47280,that problem to God don't take it out on your  friends don't take it out on your family don't  
ydZAcANvrkY,47280,52960,try to solve it yourself you take that problem  first to God seek first the kingdom and see if  
ydZAcANvrkY,52960,59280,all these things aren't given to you as well  take it to him first you see when God's people  
ydZAcANvrkY,59840,67280,put God first blessings begin to flow I want to  challenge you to let this be the year you put  
ydZAcANvrkY,67280,73600,God first keep first things first he promises  and then everything else will fall into place
ydZAcANvrkY,76080,83440,actively seek God's direction in other words God's  strategies are better than ours the Prophet Isaiah  
ydZAcANvrkY,83440,89520,said his ways are higher than my ways his thoughts  are higher than my thoughts God's strategies are  
ydZAcANvrkY,89520,94880,always better so I've got to seek him I've got to  ask him for direction and how do I do that I do  
ydZAcANvrkY,94880,100320,that through prayer why because we don't want our  plans to prevail we want God's plans to prevail  
ydZAcANvrkY,100320,110480,we want God's wisdom in our life that's why  we seek him that's why I get up in the morning    and pray and talk to God what I need God's  direction I can't live life on my own impulses  
ydZAcANvrkY,110480,117040,my own strategies my own gut instinct no I need  the spirit of God giving me wisdom and that's  
ydZAcANvrkY,117040,127840,something that can only come to pass through  prayer but here's what I've noticed many of us    in the body of Christ churches and Christians  we go to God with an already made up mind  
ydZAcANvrkY,129039,135920,like we know what we're going to do and then we're  just asking God to bless it but God's saying I  
ydZAcANvrkY,135920,142959,wasn't in it to begin with and you're asking me to  bless something that I didn't ordain in your life  
ydZAcANvrkY,144000,153280,I didn't want you to make that choice you made  that choice and I believe God wants to help you    no matter what the situation is but God's not  here just to give to you he wants to guide you  
ydZAcANvrkY,154480,160640,not just give you things he wants to guide you  in Psalm 32 it says I will guide you along the  
ydZAcANvrkY,160640,172159,best pathway for your life how many of you  are thankful that God has a best pathway    for your life but we have to seek his direction  well Josh I don't know I don't know how this all  
ydZAcANvrkY,172160,182000,gonna work out why don't you just read Proverbs  chapter three verse five and six it says trust    God from the bottom of your heart and don't try  to figure out everything on your own listen for  
ydZAcANvrkY,182000,187840,God's voice in everything you do and everywhere  you go he's the one who will keep you on track  
ydZAcANvrkY,189360,194880,God will keep you on track don't plan first and  then when you're out in the middle of doing what  
ydZAcANvrkY,194880,201440,you want to do pray for God to make it  work now first we pray about everything
ydZAcANvrkY,203840,211680,acknowledging God in all of our ways and he will  direct our path but there are times in our lives  
ydZAcANvrkY,211680,217519,where our actions aren't necessarily in obedience  to what God's told us to do why because we want  
ydZAcANvrkY,217520,222640,to do something else or what God's asking us to  do doesn't feel good or what God's asking us to  
ydZAcANvrkY,222640,230319,do doesn't align with our plans our actions are  inconsistent with what we say that we believe  
ydZAcANvrkY,230320,236000,so what do we have to do we got to get the right  habits habits are powerful they create our future  
ydZAcANvrkY,236560,242080,the habits that we live with and our actions that  we do every day create the future that we're going  
ydZAcANvrkY,242080,253760,to experience today I would dare say that many  of us are sitting in the middle of a life that    we've created by our own habits by our own actions  and when we're experiencing difficulty in life and  
ydZAcANvrkY,253760,263120,when we're tired of it it's then we got to say you  know what I can't keep doing this thing anymore    it's bringing pain into my life and it's not  working out so what habits does God want to  
ydZAcANvrkY,263120,269120,help you drop this year what habits does he want  to help to establish on the inside of you you see  
ydZAcANvrkY,269120,274320,for some of you I believe that God wants to help  you establish a habit of prayer a habit of prayer  
ydZAcANvrkY,274320,283200,in your life where you start seeking God in the  morning in a fresh way you start knowing God's    will for your life some of you he just wants  you to be faithful to come to his house more  
ydZAcANvrkY,283760,288800,make church a priority in your life and I know the  kids sports are important I know that things come  
ydZAcANvrkY,288800,296720,up and I'm not saying that all that stuff is bad  but if you don't make parents if you don't make    church a priority in your kid's life don't to be  surprised that when they move out of the house  
ydZAcANvrkY,296720,302400,it's not a priority to them it takes faithful  consistency in our actions to get breakthrough  
ydZAcANvrkY,302400,306240,I believe breakthrough people do consistently  what other people just do occasionally  
ydZAcANvrkY,307760,313360,most Christians I know who grow cold in their  faith or who who grow unproductive or unfruitful  
ydZAcANvrkY,313360,319439,or unhappy in their lives do not do so out of  a moment of rebellion but do so as a result of  
ydZAcANvrkY,319440,326960,minute by minute or day by day just drifting off  course the book of Hebrews the writer of the book  
ydZAcANvrkY,326960,334160,of Hebrews says we must pay much closer attention  to what we have heard lest we drift away from it  
ydZAcANvrkY,335040,342960,let the discipline of the first fruits recalibrate  you every day every week so you can stay  
ydZAcANvrkY,342960,348560,focused and you can stay on target now  one of the saddest scriptures in the bible  
ydZAcANvrkY,350480,360240,is Jeremiah 2:32 says my people have forgotten  me days without number but I love the  
ydZAcANvrkY,360240,366240,net translation of Jeremiah 2:32 does a  young woman forget to put on her jewels  
ydZAcANvrkY,367280,370400,have you ever forgot your cell  phone and went back home to get it
ydZAcANvrkY,374480,382480,says will a bride forget to put on her wedding  dress but my people have forgotten me for more  
ydZAcANvrkY,382480,389520,days than can even be counted we'll go back  home if we forget our cell phone but has anybody  
ydZAcANvrkY,389520,393840,here ever forgotten to pray and thought oh I'm  going back home to pray before I start this day  
ydZAcANvrkY,395040,401600,I'm suggesting that you no longer try to work  God into your schedule but you work your schedule  
ydZAcANvrkY,401600,407120,around God he would like to guide you and lead  you through life and literally let me say it  
ydZAcANvrkY,407120,415840,again be involved in everything you do in every  decision you make God wants to be part of it  
ydZAcANvrkY,417680,425919,be patient be patient and wait don't give up don't  give in James one says consider it a sheer gift  
ydZAcANvrkY,425920,434639,when tests and challenges come at you from all  sides you know that under pressure your faith    life is forced out into the open and it shows  its true colors in other words you really in it  
ydZAcANvrkY,434640,440640,or not it says don't try to get out of anything  prematurely let it do it its work so you become  
ydZAcANvrkY,440640,447280,mature and well developed not deficient in any way  one translation says that you'll not lack anything  
ydZAcANvrkY,447280,452720,if I don't give up on God then I know on the  other side of my faithful obedience and patience  
ydZAcANvrkY,452720,461840,then I'm going to be I'm going to be stronger  than I've ever been I'm going to be more mature    than I've ever been my marriage is going to be  better than it's ever been I'm going to not be  
ydZAcANvrkY,461840,467919,lacking anything that I need in my life if I don't  throw in the towel and give up when times get hard  
ydZAcANvrkY,467920,476320,I'm going to trust God and God's going to bring  a breakthrough you know how you're going to get    through the attack you're facing friends you know  how you're going to get through the trials and  
ydZAcANvrkY,476320,486720,the tribulation that you feel like you're facing  today you're only going to be able to get through    it with God's help many years ago God finally  got this through to me and he simply said this  
ydZAcANvrkY,487440,497760,you cannot do this and by this he meant  life ministry whatever your this is  
ydZAcANvrkY,498400,510160,we're talking about you're this rather  you're this is raising four kids    whether you're this as being a single parent  you cannot do this unless you put God first  
ydZAcANvrkY,511840,519839,in your life that means I can't do without  him how do you keep going when times are tough  
ydZAcANvrkY,520400,533839,it's because you believe that your  breakthrough's right around the corner    my breakthrough is on the way I may not have it  yet but I'm closer today than I was yesterday
ydZAcANvrkY,534800,545200,Quit tying God's hands and take the limits off  of him your situation is not too big for God  
ydZAcANvrkY,546880,551520,what you're dealing with it's not  like God haven't seen it before  
ydZAcANvrkY,554560,564000,he's done it before he can do it again  there's no sickness that God having healed  
ydZAcANvrkY,566160,576720,there's not a soul that he can't deliver    there's not a marriage he can't put  back together but you got to trust him
ydZAcANvrkY,579200,586000,and take the limits off of him limits are  something that bound or restrain or confine  
ydZAcANvrkY,586000,592800,something or someone who cannot do something  or have reached their limits but I want to tell  
ydZAcANvrkY,592800,598800,you that there is no limit in God he's  able to do whatever you need him to do  
ydZAcANvrkY,599360,607680,he knows that whatever your problem is he knows  the solution to your problem the bible says  
ydZAcANvrkY,607680,616160,Ephesians 3 and 20 now unto him that is able  to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we  
ydZAcANvrkY,616160,624720,could ask or think according to the power that  worketh in us you know there is no limit in God  
ydZAcANvrkY,626480,635440,he's able to do whatever we need him to do  and know this there's nothing too hard for God
ydZAcANvrkY,638080,652639,but when you take the limit off of God    you will see miracles take place if you trust  him take the limits off of him expect the great  
ydZAcANvrkY,654160,660240,awesome things will happen in your life God don't  give you what you want he gives you what you  
ydZAcANvrkY,660240,666320,believe see the how-to is none of your business  you keep getting in the way of the blessing  
ydZAcANvrkY,666320,671360,cause you all up in the how-to part of it show me  the scripture where he tells you to figure out how  
ydZAcANvrkY,671360,678800,to do anything he don't ask you to how to nothing  you just need the word you need to know what it's  
ydZAcANvrkY,678800,684640,saying applied to you you know why because it's  a promise of his he never lied he always come  
ydZAcANvrkY,684640,694720,through Psalm 78 verse 41 he says yes they turned  back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of  
ydZAcANvrkY,694720,700639,Israel they limited the Holy One of Israel now  how is it possible that we can limit God isn't God  
ydZAcANvrkY,700640,706800,limitless isn't God bigger than than we ever could  think or imagine doesn't he want to do exceeding  
ydZAcANvrkY,706800,711120,abundantly above all above and beyond all that  we can ask or think anybody got an answer to that  
ydZAcANvrkY,712160,718399,absolutely he's bigger than all that but yet they  limited him but we do put limits on God sometimes  
ydZAcANvrkY,718400,725280,in our mind we have a version of what God is  capable of we have a version of what God is like  
ydZAcANvrkY,725280,730960,we have a version of what Jesus is like we got to  get rid of a small God we gotta let go of a small  
ydZAcANvrkY,730960,736160,Jesus we gotta stop worshiping a small savior he  is the conquering King he is the King of Kings  
ydZAcANvrkY,736160,747040,and the Lord of Lords he is bigger than you ever  imagined he is greater than you ever imagined God    is able to do so many things but we limit him we  limit him because of what we hear other people say  
ydZAcANvrkY,747040,754320,we limit him because of a human natural  experience we limit the Holy One of Israel  
ydZAcANvrkY,754320,762000,God is unlimited amen in Matthew chapter 9 Jesus  came into the house the blind man came to him and  
ydZAcANvrkY,762000,768320,Jesus said to them do you believe that I'm able  to do this do you believe that I'm able to do this  
ydZAcANvrkY,768320,775520,do you believe no I didn't say do you believe  you can see but do you believe Jesus said  
ydZAcANvrkY,775520,782560,do you believe that I am able to do this our  faith is not in our faith our faith is in him  
ydZAcANvrkY,784240,791360,it is not your faith it is who you have your faith  in a lot of times people are limiting their own  
ydZAcANvrkY,791360,798800,lives in what they say about themselves being down  on yourself feeling like you're not good enough  
ydZAcANvrkY,799360,803600,like you're less than and this voice can  come to us in a lot of different ways  
ydZAcANvrkY,804400,810080,the world is going to tell you what you can't  do satan is going to tell you what you can't do  
ydZAcANvrkY,810720,816480,you don't also need to be in agreement with  those voices instead you need to agree with  
ydZAcANvrkY,816480,822959,what God says about you if God approves you then  approve yourself if God chose you then choose  
ydZAcANvrkY,822960,829280,yourself if God believes in you then you should  believe in yourself we got to learn to stop the  
ydZAcANvrkY,829280,836480,negative voices and start to recognize I'm still  a work in progress so often we look at the mess  
ydZAcANvrkY,837520,842240,and we don't look at the progress David had a  different kind of voice he said this in Psalms  
ydZAcANvrkY,842800,849200,chapter 18 and verse 29 because of God I can  run through a troop because of my helper the  
ydZAcANvrkY,849200,855840,Lord I can leap over a wall you see because of God  I can do you see that we need to take on that same  
ydZAcANvrkY,856400,867680,uh that same kind of phrasing in our life that  same kind of belief system because of God I can    not I can't I'll never be enough I'm not smart  enough I got rejected I had a bad start pastor  
ydZAcANvrkY,867680,873520,no David didn't do that David said because of  God I can you know people are going to say stuff  
ydZAcANvrkY,873520,879600,about you to try and limit you but don't limit  yourself you've got enough against you for you  
ydZAcANvrkY,879600,886240,to be against yourself if God is for you then  why would you want to be against yourself take  
ydZAcANvrkY,886240,896960,off the limits of what other people try and put  on you they said you can't do it but that doesn't    mean that you can't do it they didn't create you  see God will take the unique things about you  
ydZAcANvrkY,896960,902240,and use them to promote you and elevate sometimes  the same thing you don't like about yourself  
ydZAcANvrkY,902240,908720,is the same thing God wants to use to show you  greatness and promotion what's our job to stop  
ydZAcANvrkY,908720,916160,being mad about ourselves and putting ourselves  down stop being so hard on ourselves quit telling  
ydZAcANvrkY,916160,921440,yourself all the reasons you can't accomplish  your dreams what you don't have what you didn't  
ydZAcANvrkY,921440,928480,get it's not going to happen just by your ability  your talent your connections it's going to happen  
ydZAcANvrkY,928480,935199,by the spirit of the living God he's breathing  on your life right now his favor is surrounding  
ydZAcANvrkY,935200,942960,you in a greater way there are breakthroughs  already enroute healing promotions contracts  
ydZAcANvrkY,942960,948720,the right people they're already headed your way  now don't talk yourself out of it receive the  
ydZAcANvrkY,948720,955600,blessing now take the limits off of God and  take the limits off of yourself most people  
ydZAcANvrkY,955600,960959,have kind of a fatalistic theology that  things just happen and it's fatalistic and it  
ydZAcANvrkY,960960,965360,there's nothing you can do about it and that  is absolutely untrue God has a perfect plan  
ydZAcANvrkY,966720,974000,for every person's life in here and God has  good thoughts for you his plans for your life  
ydZAcANvrkY,974000,981040,are awesome he never made a piece of junk he never  made a dud he never made an average person every  
ydZAcANvrkY,981040,987279,one of us have something special that God wants  to accomplish but most people are ignorant of  
ydZAcANvrkY,987280,992560,this and they have bought into the lie of this  world that there's nothing special about them  
ydZAcANvrkY,993360,1005680,every one of you are special every one of you  are unique every one of you can do something    that nobody else can do God has a purpose for  your life and most people are limiting what God  
ydZAcANvrkY,1005680,1011920,can do because they just aren't challenging  themselves God made you for something great  
ydZAcANvrkY,1013200,1019920,God has taken ordinary people what the world  calls ordinary people and time after time after  
ydZAcANvrkY,1019920,1025439,time after time after time has just transformed  their life and then use them to touch other people  
ydZAcANvrkY,1025439,1031839,and change things but when you put God first  I guarantee you he will transform your life
ydZAcANvrkY,1036000,1043439,While I wait God works this is not a a  nice little Christian sentiment to get  
ydZAcANvrkY,1043439,1049679,you through a hard season this is anchored  in the unchanging word of God he promises us  
ydZAcANvrkY,1049680,1056720,if you wait on me I'll work for you if you wait  on me if you're patient if you have expectation  
ydZAcANvrkY,1056720,1061840,if you don't give up if you don't cash out  if you just keep following me I promise you  
ydZAcANvrkY,1061840,1074320,you may not see what I'm doing you may even be  tempted to think I'm not doing anything at all    but all the while I'm orchestrating things for  my glory and for your good God works while we  
ydZAcANvrkY,1074960,1082240,wait even when I don't see it and even when I  don't feel it you're working so grab hold of that  
ydZAcANvrkY,1082240,1091600,and cling to that truth it doesn't mean your  circumstances change in a minute it doesn't mean    you're going to wake up tomorrow to uh to a bed  full of roses it just means that while you wait  
ydZAcANvrkY,1092560,1104960,heaven works God's always working no matter what  the crossroads you're at in life when you are  
ydZAcANvrkY,1104960,1110480,forced to face the trials and tribulations of  life when you are at the point not knowing what  
ydZAcANvrkY,1110480,1117040,to do or where to turn you can trust in God  every one of us go through valley experiences  
ydZAcANvrkY,1118320,1123679,every one of us are faced with these valleys these  are part of the experience of life but every time  
ydZAcANvrkY,1123680,1133520,we go through these valleys we need to know  that he's there God may not he may not do what  
ydZAcANvrkY,1133520,1137760,you think he may do the total opposite of what  you think but he's still going to do something  
ydZAcANvrkY,1139520,1152000,so many times we think God what have you done  why have you left me out no man apathy's not in    that brother's vocabulary and he ain't never  late he made time he is time he has infinite  
ydZAcANvrkY,1152000,1158720,wisdom he has all the information that could ever  be known he's the alpha the scripture says in the  
ydZAcANvrkY,1158720,1164799,omega so he stands at the end and makes decisions  about now where we stand in the now and go with  
ydZAcANvrkY,1164800,1173280,all the information we have we don't know why  God you're not doing this and God's going oh    that's because you don't have all the information  yet there's a lot of things you don't understand  
ydZAcANvrkY,1173280,1179520,yet and I'm navigating all those pieces to  make sure what we do isn't fast but is right  
ydZAcANvrkY,1180480,1190080,and is good and is noble Lamentations 3:25 says  this the Lord is good to those who wait for him  
ydZAcANvrkY,1190080,1197440,to the person who seeks after him you have to  know today that we are serving a God who is other  
ydZAcANvrkY,1198000,1204800,than us it's not a better version of you bigger  version of you cleaner version of you his ways are  
ydZAcANvrkY,1204800,1218559,higher than our ways and his thoughts are higher  than our thoughts is what Isaiah says so when you    can't hear his voice speaking trust that his  hands are working trust God's timing while you  
ydZAcANvrkY,1218560,1226080,wait trust God's timing while you wait there's  a reason for your delay see there's a reason for  
ydZAcANvrkY,1226080,1231200,every season that we go through and if we'll not  get bitter and upset we'll start to trust God in  
ydZAcANvrkY,1231200,1237760,the middle of the season see I like a and I like  z I'm not a big fan of l m n o p I'm not a big fan  
ydZAcANvrkY,1237760,1243600,of the middle I like the beginning and the end but  God says if you'll trust me from l to m to n to o  
ydZAcANvrkY,1243600,1252240,to p I'll take you to z and you'll be grateful  because what I'm doing in you is more important    than where you're going to what I'm going to  do in you is more important than what I'll do  
ydZAcANvrkY,1252240,1258480,through you I've got to do something in you at  g h i j k before you get to z you think you're  
ydZAcANvrkY,1258480,1265440,ready for the blessing but I'm still preparing  you I'm still working and it's a process trust

ydZAcANvrkY,1273200,1280720,no matter how big your problems are if if you can  spend time in the presence of God and you know  
ydZAcANvrkY,1280720,1286640,that he's walking with you it overrides everything  else that's going on in your life because you just  
ydZAcANvrkY,1286640,1294000,know that he's going to take care of it some way  somehow you just make sure that you stay in faith  
ydZAcANvrkY,1295760,1304800,that you keep believing and let me work as long as  you're believing God is working and I'll tell you  
ydZAcANvrkY,1304800,1316400,what we need to be saying more of and I've I've  I've been doing this for a good number of years    and it's really really helpful when I'm waiting  on something and then I start to think about how  
ydZAcANvrkY,1316400,1322400,long it's been and you know my mind starts  to go negative I say out loud God is working
ydZAcANvrkY,1326320,1333440,God is working and it helps me because he is you  know when you get a breakthrough God didn't start  
ydZAcANvrkY,1333440,1339360,just working on that a second before you got it  God's working in your life right now he's heard  
ydZAcANvrkY,1339360,1345040,your prayers he's working in your situation but  especially when you've prayed prayers for other  
ydZAcANvrkY,1345040,1352720,people you have no control over how long it  takes them to listen to God you work hard and  
ydZAcANvrkY,1352720,1358559,you've believed God and you've been waiting what  seems like forever for that kid to change or for  
ydZAcANvrkY,1358560,1366080,your finances to change or for you to change  or whatever but I'm here to tell you I've been  
ydZAcANvrkY,1366080,1373840,there done that still go through it in different  seasons at different times and I am telling you  
ydZAcANvrkY,1374400,1380640,by the word of God and from my my experience and  the experience of many others that God is faithful
ydZAcANvrkY,1382720,1390080,and I don't know how long you will have  to wait but I do know that God will come  
ydZAcANvrkY,1390080,1399039,through and I do know that you can enjoy your wait  if you will just improve your attitude how we wait  
ydZAcANvrkY,1400000,1410640,is possibly more important than what  we're waiting for if we're going to    spend all this time waiting why not wait with  the right attitude why not live our best days  
ydZAcANvrkY,1410640,1415760,even while we're waiting for the destination you  don't have to wait till you get to the destination  
ydZAcANvrkY,1415760,1421120,to live out your best days you can start living  out your best days even while you're waiting  
ydZAcANvrkY,1421120,1425920,that's what God wants for us and I feel like  God has this this thought with us he says listen  
ydZAcANvrkY,1426880,1435200,there's a right way to wait and there's a wrong  way to wait some people wait with impatience they    wait with anger frustration twiddling their  thumbs when are you going to be ready when  
ydZAcANvrkY,1435200,1440320,are we going to get there are we there yet uh some  people wait with anger why why have I not reached  
ydZAcANvrkY,1440320,1448960,to where I want to be why have we not sold the  house yet why why haven't we moved into a house    and sometimes we can get tired while  we're waiting on the next season of life  
ydZAcANvrkY,1450800,1458880,and hope begins to wane in the waiting doesn't  it because you begin to think okay well maybe  
ydZAcANvrkY,1458880,1469360,tomorrow's going to be the day well after so  many maybe tomorrow is going to be the day    the enemy begins to have a playground with your  mind and go no yesterday wasn't the day and  
ydZAcANvrkY,1469360,1476880,tomorrow's not going to be the day I'm waiting  here we as a people don't like to wait so at  
ydZAcANvrkY,1476880,1486880,the end of the day what do you do when you feel  like his voice is silent we trust that his hands  
ydZAcANvrkY,1487840,1498480,are active his ability to work does not hinge on  my perception of him working he is God almighty  
ydZAcANvrkY,1498480,1507520,and paints on a bigger canvas than I can imagine  this is who he is he's never missed a call he's  
ydZAcANvrkY,1507520,1512960,never done something he wished he could take back  he's never been so busy figuring out something  
ydZAcANvrkY,1512960,1519760,that he missed you over here while you were doing  your thing never one time has God failed and today  
ydZAcANvrkY,1519760,1526160,won't be the day he starts and you won't be the  person that he starts with this is the hope but  
ydZAcANvrkY,1526160,1531920,remember what is hope it's a positive expectation  that something good is going to happen to me  
ydZAcANvrkY,1533360,1544000,to have hope and expectancy is the  Hebrew translation for the word    wait so he's not saying just wait like you know  maybe this is going to happen or I'd kind of like  
ydZAcANvrkY,1544000,1555120,throw you know throw a coin in a wishing well  I hope this I wish this would happen no he says    wait with an expectant heart that God's going to  bring this to pass wait with great expectations  
ydZAcANvrkY,1555120,1564320,and this is what Isaiah says he says if you'll  wait upon the Lord and you'll wait the right way    he will renew your strength you will mount  up with wings like eagles you will run and  
ydZAcANvrkY,1564320,1570880,not be weary you will walk and not faint that's  God's promise to us that if we wait the right way  
ydZAcANvrkY,1571440,1580320,we're not going to get burned out we're not going  to get exhausted we're not going to get impatient    and settle for something less than what God has  promised us to wait on we're going to be able to  
ydZAcANvrkY,1580320,1586000,hold steady in the middle of our waiting and not  fall off not quit church not quit believing in God  
ydZAcANvrkY,1586000,1592080,not give up on the promises sometimes when we're  waiting for a promise it's easy to get exhausted  
ydZAcANvrkY,1592080,1598000,while we're waiting it's easy to get impatient  to feel burned out to just say you know what  
ydZAcANvrkY,1599280,1608080,whatever I'm not going to church I'm not going  to believe it I'm going to stop reading my bible    when the promise comes to pass then I'll believe  that God's for me we've got to learn how to wait  
ydZAcANvrkY,1608080,1613440,with expectancy that even while we're waiting for  the promise to come to pass God's with me he's for  
ydZAcANvrkY,1613440,1618799,me he's working behind scenes it will happen God  I'm believing that my best days are not behind me  
ydZAcANvrkY,1618800,1627200,Lord I'm believing the promise will come to pass  what's in front of me is going to be greater than    what's behind me Lord what you're doing in me  is greater than what is happening to me Lord  
ydZAcANvrkY,1627200,1634639,I'm standing on your promises I will not quit I  will not give up I'm expecting a harvest in Jesus  
ydZAcANvrkY,1634640,1641280,name God's saying it's time for you to wait  with great expectations this season is important  
ydZAcANvrkY,1642560,1650160,don't get bitter while you're waiting for the  promises of God to come to pass while you're    waiting for that family member to get back to  church while you're waiting for that that loved  
ydZAcANvrkY,1650160,1660240,one to give his life back to Jesus while you're  waiting for a house to sell while you're waiting    to to to do that next season direction from God  whatever you're waiting on God says wait with  
ydZAcANvrkY,1660240,1666240,great expectations put your hope in the Lord James  chapter 5 verse 7 says that we're called to wait  
ydZAcANvrkY,1666240,1672720,like a farmer waits for the harvest a farmer is  confident he's not stressed out he's not worried  
ydZAcANvrkY,1672720,1679360,I don't know if the harvest is going to come  no he knows harvest is on the way I've done my  
ydZAcANvrkY,1679360,1685040,work I've planted I've done all the watering it's  just a matter of time before the harvest gets here  
ydZAcANvrkY,1685760,1690880,see we're called to wait with that kind of  confidence God the promise is coming to pass what  
ydZAcANvrkY,1690880,1696800,I've been praying for Lord I've been sowing the  seeds Lord I'm expecting the harvest is on the way  
ydZAcANvrkY,1702080,1710320,Let me ask you a question  When are you going to start thanking  God for the miracle in your life  
ydZAcANvrkY,1711600,1720480,you know that thing you've always wanted to happen  that prayer you've always been praying that dream    you've always had when are you going to start  thanking God for you say well after it happens  
ydZAcANvrkY,1720480,1727200,when you thank God after something happens that's  called gratitude when you thank God for something  
ydZAcANvrkY,1727200,1737600,before it happens that's called faith the highest  form of faith is thanking God in advance before  
ydZAcANvrkY,1737600,1743919,you get the answer but while you make the request  what do you do while you're waiting you thank God  
ydZAcANvrkY,1744720,1749520,say God you know that request I made the other day  I thank you that the answer is already on its way  
ydZAcANvrkY,1750400,1756080,it's not here yet but I thank you that the answer  is already on its way and you just keep thanking  
ydZAcANvrkY,1756080,1761360,and thanking that is the highest form of faith you  don't keep saying please give it please give it

ydZAcANvrkY,1802000,1807280,I'll say it again true desire in  the heart that itch that you have  
ydZAcANvrkY,1807280,1812000,whatever it is you want to do that desire  that itch that's God's proof to you  
ydZAcANvrkY,1812800,1819680,sent beforehand already to indicate that  it's yours Jesus said this in Mark chapter 11  
ydZAcANvrkY,1821360,1831600,anytime you ask for anything in prayer believe  that you have received it and you will receive it  
ydZAcANvrkY,1832400,1837680,now I really want you to get this notice the  change in tense here believe that you have  
ydZAcANvrkY,1837680,1846400,received it that's past tense and you will receive  it that's future tense you say wait a minute I've  
ydZAcANvrkY,1846400,1852880,got to believe I've got it in order to get it  yep that's called faith I believe that I've got

ydZAcANvrkY,1858080,1866480,it isn't so so that it will become so yes that's  called faith we all have dreams and goals that  
ydZAcANvrkY,1866480,1872080,God's placed in our heart things we're believing  for situations we're praying to turn around  
ydZAcANvrkY,1872800,1879840,these promises start off like seeds they don't  come to pass overnight there's always a period  
ydZAcANvrkY,1879840,1886320,of waiting involved and from the time we pray  till the time we see it come to fulfillment  
ydZAcANvrkY,1886320,1892240,that's called the trial of our faith this is  when many people get discouraged and give up  
ydZAcANvrkY,1892880,1899520,they start believing the negative thoughts it's  never going to happen it's taken too long now that  
ydZAcANvrkY,1899520,1906160,seed is lying dormant it's still alive it still  has potential but you have to do your part and  
ydZAcANvrkY,1906160,1913280,start watering the seed the way you water it is  by thanking God in advance you can't wait till you  
ydZAcANvrkY,1913280,1919680,receive the promise you have to thank God that the  answer is on the way maybe you're struggling in

ydZAcANvrkY,1966320,1972559,after business picks up after I see the solution  now if you don't learn this principle to thank  
ydZAcANvrkY,1972560,1979840,God in advance you won't have the strength you  need to wait for the promise what keeps us strong

ydZAcANvrkY,1984880,1990960,that this problem's turning around thank you that  you're bigger than this obstacle giving thanks to  
ydZAcANvrkY,1990960,1997919,God removes the anxiety you can be anxious and  worried about anything you start thanking him  
ydZAcANvrkY,1997920,2003600,praising him focusing on him and it is amazing  how the anxiety disappears next thing you know you  
ydZAcANvrkY,2003600,2010320,think well what am I worried about I've got Holy  almighty sovereign God on my side taking care of  
ydZAcANvrkY,2010320,2017200,me why am I down in the dumps listen living in the  dumps isn't God's plan and he can get you out real  
ydZAcANvrkY,2017200,2022799,fast you start thanking him and praising him the  devil runs and God gets you out you're rejoicing  
ydZAcANvrkY,2022800,2028720,and praising the Lord before you know it because  anxiety and fretting over things is not the will  
ydZAcANvrkY,2028720,2037600,of God we're thanking God before the battle we're  thanking God in advance that's verbalized faith

ydZAcANvrkY,2049280,2056240,once you pray and ask God to bring the promise  to pass you ask God to heal you you ask him to  
ydZAcANvrkY,2056240,2063119,restore a relationship from then on you don't  need to ask God one more time he heard you the  
ydZAcANvrkY,2063120,2070160,very first time now every time you think about it  you should thank God that the answer is on the way  
ydZAcANvrkY,2071360,2077520,one time Daniel prayed and asked God to help  him day after day went by nothing got better  
ydZAcANvrkY,2077520,2084240,it looked like that God didn't even hear his  prayer but on the 21st day an angel showed up  
ydZAcANvrkY,2084879,2092879,and said Daniel the first day you prayed God heard  you and dispatched me with the answer but it took  
ydZAcANvrkY,2092879,2100079,me 21 days to fight through the forces of darkness  what I want you to see is the first day you prayed  
ydZAcANvrkY,2100080,2106960,God heard you the first time you asked God set the  miracle into motion the very first day the answer  
ydZAcANvrkY,2106960,2113520,was on the way that's why you don't have to keep  praying about the same thing begging God asking  
ydZAcANvrkY,2113520,2121040,again and again the answer is already on the way  the promise is already in motion the breakthrough  
ydZAcANvrkY,2121040,2128400,is already in route the right person is already in  your future the victory is already up ahead of you

ydZAcANvrkY,2135280,2140800,him in advance for the healing the restoration  the promotion the vindication the dream  
ydZAcANvrkY,2141440,2148560,it's headed your way you only need to ask God for  it one time but then in all your future prayers  
ydZAcANvrkY,2148560,2153920,you thank him does that make sense so you don't  have to keep going please give it to me please  
ydZAcANvrkY,2153920,2164160,give it to me please give it to me please like  you're begging God no you just have to say God I    want you to give this to me and then for the rest  of the time until it arrives you just thank God  
ydZAcANvrkY,2164960,2171280,that's faith some of you have prayed about the  situation long enough you've got to switch over  
ydZAcANvrkY,2171280,2177120,into praise get up every morning father thank you  that my dreams are coming to pass thank you that  
ydZAcANvrkY,2177120,2182640,healing is coming thank you that promotion is on  its way that's what's going to keep you strong

ydZAcANvrkY,2189440,2199840,God heard it and set the miracle  into motion it's already on the way    as you keep giving God praise he's going  to keep giving you strength to believe  
ydZAcANvrkY,2200720,2211360,when are you going to start thanking  God for that breakthrough in your life    you've wanted it all your life but you haven't  been thanking God for it in advance you just been  
ydZAcANvrkY,2211920,2221119,begging like you have to bargain  or bribe or pressure God to say yes    God wants to say yes he's waiting for you  to show faith when are you going to thank  
ydZAcANvrkY,2221120,2225040,God in advance when are you going to put  the choir before the army in your life

ydZAcANvrkY,2297360,2306240,to make it to the end of your marathon and end  well when we go through a bad season of life  
ydZAcANvrkY,2307280,2313120,those circumstances that are oppressing us  they're very real but there's another reality  
ydZAcANvrkY,2313120,2320320,and that reality that God is in the heavens and  he is controlling and watching and all powerful  
ydZAcANvrkY,2320320,2326320,over every circumstance in our life we have a  choice are we going to focus on our circumstances  
ydZAcANvrkY,2326320,2333600,or are we going to focus on our God things will  start looking up when you start looking up  
ydZAcANvrkY,2334320,2339600,in other words your circumstances will improve  when you stop looking at them start looking to  
ydZAcANvrkY,2339600,2347840,God let me say it again things start looking  up when I start looking up you know in the  
ydZAcANvrkY,2347840,2353840,bible there's a phrase that's used over and over  and over and it is the phrase lift up your eyes  
ydZAcANvrkY,2355040,2363440,said many many times in scripture  it's just one way of saying look up    get your eyes off yourself and off your  problems and off your circumstances and  
ydZAcANvrkY,2363440,2371520,on to God refocus look at him things will  start looking up when I start looking up
ydZAcANvrkY,2373760,2380240,when we look up and we see how big God is it  naturally shrinks the size of our problems they  
ydZAcANvrkY,2380240,2386400,just don't seem to be as big or as overwhelming  when compared to the greatness of God I don't know  
ydZAcANvrkY,2386400,2393440,what burdens you're bearing I don't know what  grief or fear or anxiety or confusion you may  
ydZAcANvrkY,2393440,2401760,be feeling right now but I do know this you need  to look up instead of giving up don't give up  
ydZAcANvrkY,2402560,2412080,look up in your disillusioned heart in your angst  you've got your eyes focused on the wrong place
ydZAcANvrkY,2414560,2421440,until your eyes are fixed on the Lord you won't be  able to endure the days that go from bad to worse  
ydZAcANvrkY,2423440,2431280,that's the key  until your eyes are fixed on the Lord you won't be  able to endure the days that go from bad to worse  
ydZAcANvrkY,2432480,2438240,the bible invites us over and over and over fix  your eyes on me God says fix your eyes on me  
ydZAcANvrkY,2438240,2446000,fix your eyes on me Hebrews calls us let us fix  our eyes on Jesus the author and the perfecter  
ydZAcANvrkY,2446000,2454080,of our faith are you in the middle of a of  a discouraging season fix your eyes friends  
ydZAcANvrkY,2455840,2466080,fix your eyes back on Jesus in a in a season  of emotional pain fix your eyes on Jesus  
ydZAcANvrkY,2466080,2473680,do it once do it twice do it multiple times a  day do it constantly throughout the day remember  
ydZAcANvrkY,2474240,2482320,and rehearse who he is remember who he  is remember what he's promised to do
ydZAcANvrkY,2484400,2495280,so when your schedules press when  your prospects thin when your hope    burns low when people disappoint you when  events turn against you when dreams die  
ydZAcANvrkY,2497040,2502880,when the walls close in when the  prognosis is grim when your heart breaks  
ydZAcANvrkY,2506240,2511119,because when life is crushing we  don't have anywhere else to go  
ydZAcANvrkY,2512880,2522880,because of who he is he will  always do what is best for you    now sometimes we have to talk ourselves off the  ledge we have to remind ourselves of important  
ydZAcANvrkY,2522880,2531359,truths like God knows what he's doing he doesn't  make mistakes his timing is always perfect  
ydZAcANvrkY,2532560,2539200,whatever is happening he is choosing to allow  for this moment it's challenging to trust and  
ydZAcANvrkY,2539200,2545680,keep trusting but we have to because he is who he  said he is and he will do what he says he'll do  
ydZAcANvrkY,2548400,2561120,this is the difference between ordinary people  and great people great people never give up    they never give up they keep on in the marathon  of life even when they're fatigued even  
ydZAcANvrkY,2561120,2567120,when they're frustrated even when they feel  like failures and even when they're fearful  
ydZAcANvrkY,2570560,2578800,don't you dare friend give in without a fight  fight back fight back against your discouragement  
ydZAcANvrkY,2578800,2585200,fight back against the devil fight back against  those who want to discourage you you got a great  
ydZAcANvrkY,2585200,2592880,dream and at some point the devil's whispers in  your who do you think you are attempting to do  
ydZAcANvrkY,2592880,2600480,this wrong question you should build your life  not on what you think you can do but what you  
ydZAcANvrkY,2600480,2608880,think God can do you let the size of your God  determine the size of your goal it's not about  
ydZAcANvrkY,2609440,2619200,do you think I would have tried to do all  things I've tried to do in life because I was    depending on me not a chance in my flesh they're  dwelleth no good thing I know that I can't do  
ydZAcANvrkY,2619200,2624640,certain things Jesus said apart from me  you can do nothing so that's pretty clear  
ydZAcANvrkY,2625760,2631280,now how do you react when your  plans take longer than expected
ydZAcANvrkY,2633600,2639360,when what you thought was going to take be done  real quickly when you have a project and you go  
ydZAcANvrkY,2639360,2648640,man this has taken me a long time to get through  school it's taken me a long time to get this thing    built this has taken me what do you do you  give in to self-pity you start complaining
ydZAcANvrkY,2650720,2661840,you start blaming other people friends if  at first you don't succeed you're normal  
ydZAcANvrkY,2662800,2669280,you're normal okay nobody succeeds at first  the only way you actually succeed in life is  
ydZAcANvrkY,2669280,2675760,by failing a bunch and learning what doesn't  work failure is the stepping stone to success  
ydZAcANvrkY,2675760,2683680,nobody ever succeeds without having failures  success here's the difference between successful  
ydZAcANvrkY,2683680,2691839,and unsuccessful people successful people see  failure as a temporary setback unsuccessful people  
ydZAcANvrkY,2691840,2699920,see it as a mark on their character well I'm  a failure no no nobody succeeds at everything  
ydZAcANvrkY,2699920,2708240,nobody has an unbroken record of success  refocus on God stop listening to the negativity  
ydZAcANvrkY,2709680,2715760,and resist the discouragement don't  you give into it resist it fight it  
ydZAcANvrkY,2717600,2724480,and who will give you the energy to fight it  your Lord and savior Jesus Christ so focus on him  
ydZAcANvrkY,2725120,2730960,not on the problem when we're at our worst God's  at his best the stage is now set for God to work  
ydZAcANvrkY,2730960,2739599,his will his way you see over and over again in  the scriptures over and over again the stage is  
ydZAcANvrkY,2739600,2749200,set for God to do his most amazing work when  the situation looks the bleakest to us when  
ydZAcANvrkY,2749200,2755680,you and I are fresh out of options when you and  I are fresh uh uh at the at the end of our rope  
ydZAcANvrkY,2756480,2765040,when you and I are at the end of ourselves and  we're full of fear and we're full of uncertainty  
ydZAcANvrkY,2766720,2773840,that's when God steps back rolls up  his sleeves and starts to wow us again
ydZAcANvrkY,2775280,2784080,the challenge for us is not giving up too soon  you know a lot of people start off great in life  
ydZAcANvrkY,2785200,2791760,but even before they get to the halfway point in  their life they've already really messed it up and  
ydZAcANvrkY,2791760,2797680,they've given up which is worse than messing up  here let me say it again giving up is always worse  
ydZAcANvrkY,2798560,2804960,than messing up everybody messes up why do  people give up in the marathon of their lives  
ydZAcANvrkY,2804960,2811359,because they got discouraged choose to change  the channel of your mind don't keep replaying all  
ydZAcANvrkY,2811360,2817920,those discouraging images in your mind instead  remember the Lord choose to think about God  
ydZAcANvrkY,2819120,2824320,and what he's faithfulness his love his  mercy his compassion choose to think about  
ydZAcANvrkY,2824320,2829760,God because your thoughts always determine your  feelings do you want to stop being discouraged  
ydZAcANvrkY,2829760,2837200,then stop thinking the way you've been thinking  you know when bad days come into our lives  
ydZAcANvrkY,2839200,2845440,we want God's to do something big something  miraculous don't we our miraculous cure to the  
ydZAcANvrkY,2845440,2853680,illness the immediate return of a prodigal the  overnight breaking of a destructive addiction  
ydZAcANvrkY,2854560,2860480,the erasure of the financial problems we're  suffering we want God to act dramatically and  
ydZAcANvrkY,2860480,2868800,instantaneously sometimes he does that but usually  that's not how it works it's not in the big things  
ydZAcANvrkY,2869360,2878960,instead it's in that still small voice that God  comes to give us courage to face that illness or  
ydZAcANvrkY,2878960,2887200,the grace to accept that prodigal's departure  from God the ability the wisdom to handle the  
ydZAcANvrkY,2887200,2894800,financial difficulty we're experiencing that's  how God speaks most often and when the waves are  
ydZAcANvrkY,2894800,2901280,crashing and the winds are howling around us it  is important that we learn how to listen to God's  
ydZAcANvrkY,2901280,2908400,real but sometimes small voice in the midst of  our bad season of life bad days are inevitable  
ydZAcANvrkY,2909040,2915840,but they don't have to be paralyzing those  who live a significant life learn to expect  
ydZAcANvrkY,2915840,2922640,bad days and learn how to refresh themselves  physically emotionally and spiritually  
ydZAcANvrkY,2924080,2934960,you know I found that going through  a bad season of life is a lot like    traveling through a dark tunnel the  bad news is in that tunnel it is dark  
ydZAcANvrkY,2934960,2940160,you can't see in front of you you don't know  if you'll ever make it out but the good news  
ydZAcANvrkY,2940160,2947599,is once you've entered into that dark tunnel  with God's help you're already on the way out
ydZAcANvrkY,2950800,2959440,All of us run out of hope at some point am I  right or wrong I think all of us do even that  
ydZAcANvrkY,2959440,2968640,cup is half full sanguine soul who always goes  around singing the sun will come up tomorrow even  
ydZAcANvrkY,2968640,2977519,that person on occasion will reach up into the  shelf for a can of hope and find there is no hope
ydZAcANvrkY,2980560,2997839,maybe that's where you are today  maybe you're here more out of desperation  than inspiration is there any hope
ydZAcANvrkY,3001600,3011840,are you asking that question  you're running out of hope are you the  single mom who's running out of hope  
ydZAcANvrkY,3012960,3019520,are you the elderly person who has buried  someone you love and your hope has left you
ydZAcANvrkY,3022080,3031520,are you the businessman who looks  professional on the inside but it's    been a long time since you had a good  night's sleep and you can't find peace
ydZAcANvrkY,3033920,3043920,are you running out of hope  are you feeling like giving up are  you close to despair don't do it don't
ydZAcANvrkY,3046160,3053839,the blackest moments we live  through will last only a little time
ydZAcANvrkY,3054560,3057760,it's pretty easy sometimes to to feel beaten
ydZAcANvrkY,3060320,3073760,that doesn't mean give up  in fact it means the opposite it means it's  time for you to fight harder and I'm gonna  
ydZAcANvrkY,3073760,3081840,tell you right now it won't be easy it will be  hard because life is hard that's what life is

ydZAcANvrkY,3144080,3152800,so so in the future you look back at  these struggles and you say to them

ydZAcANvrkY,3181840,3187440,there are already witnesses in this room who will  testify it's not that I haven't been knocked down
ydZAcANvrkY,3189680,3197920,but God keeps giving me the strength the  energy the wherewithal the anointing the power  
ydZAcANvrkY,3199360,3210160,to not stay down that every time something or  somebody knocks me down God keeps raising me back up

ydZAcANvrkY,3326160,3335760,need to refuse to give up today some of you need  to remember the history of victory that God has in  
ydZAcANvrkY,3335760,3340400,your life do you remember all of those times where  you said I'm not going to make it through this  
ydZAcANvrkY,3341200,3350240,and look where you're at today I remember  some of the darkest times of my life I    would lay on the bed in tears I would lay on  the bed sometimes without even words to pray  
ydZAcANvrkY,3350800,3356800,and satan would whisper and say this is it this is  the big one this is the last time you'll ever have  
ydZAcANvrkY,3356800,3362240,to go through this because your life's going to be  ending or this is going to ruin your entire life  
ydZAcANvrkY,3363680,3369040,but guess what here I stand today but  by the grace of God he delivered me time  
ydZAcANvrkY,3369040,3376320,and time again and even when it seemed tough even  when it seemed rough my God was faithful but see  
ydZAcANvrkY,3376320,3382960,for some reason we go through a new storm we  go through a new trial and we tend to forget  
ydZAcANvrkY,3382960,3388560,all of the past and all of the times that  God delivered us church today you need to  
ydZAcANvrkY,3388560,3394720,remind yourself of the goodness of God there were  things in my life that should have taken me out  
ydZAcANvrkY,3395520,3405680,there were things in my life where  I was going the wrong direction    there were afflictions in my life that should have  killed me but by the grace of God here I am today  
ydZAcANvrkY,3405680,3410720,and you have the same story today church I want  to encourage you there's been things in your life  
ydZAcANvrkY,3410720,3417200,that should have taken you out but here you sit  today breathing alive able to see able to talk  
ydZAcANvrkY,3417200,3423760,able to walk because of the grace of God that's  something to get excited about today we have a  
ydZAcANvrkY,3423760,3434080,history of victory if God says you can make it  guess what you can make it and you will make it  
ydZAcANvrkY,3434720,3442560,no matter how negative it looks today you're going  to come back it's time to get up off the mat if  
ydZAcANvrkY,3442560,3453840,you've been knocked down if you've been through  something if you've been through financial setback    or some kind of terrible thing has hit you in your  health and or something's happened to your family  
ydZAcANvrkY,3453840,3461040,we need to believe that it's time for a comeback  it's no time to quit it's no time to give up it's  
ydZAcANvrkY,3461040,3468880,no time to moan and groan we may be down but  we're not out because we serve a comeback God  
ydZAcANvrkY,3470160,3481200,and I want you to know the attitude  of our God is I'm not going to give    up on anybody I'm preaching to some people who  have fallen behind and the enemy's whispering  
ydZAcANvrkY,3481200,3487119,to you give up the devil wants you to think  it's gone forever whatever it is that he stole  
ydZAcANvrkY,3487120,3494080,from you it's gone forever but it is not gone  forever because God is planning you a comeback  
ydZAcANvrkY,3495760,3501040,that if there's breath in our lungs he's not  finished with us yet no matter how old you are  
ydZAcANvrkY,3501040,3506960,no matter how bad you've missed it no matter how  bad things look don't worry God's not finished yet  
ydZAcANvrkY,3506960,3518320,if you haven't seen the breakthrough God's not  finished yet if you haven't seen the miracle if    things haven't turned around for the good don't  worry God's not finished see God's not setting  
ydZAcANvrkY,3518320,3523760,us up to leave us halfway finished he's not  setting us up to not finish what he started no  
ydZAcANvrkY,3523760,3529600,he wants to bring us to a flourishing finish which  means that our best days are right in front of us  
ydZAcANvrkY,3529600,3540000,some of us in this room maybe we've had failed  businesses failed marriages maybe we've made    some bad mistakes and we think to ourselves God's  done with me God can't use me he's not going to  
ydZAcANvrkY,3540000,3545280,use me in ministry again he's not going to give  me another business I declare bankruptcy you need  
ydZAcANvrkY,3545280,3552400,to stop accepting those self-limiting beliefs  those self-limiting lies those God limiting lies  
ydZAcANvrkY,3552400,3557839,we serve a God who's never finished when there's  breath in our lungs God can turn things around  
ydZAcANvrkY,3558640,3569360,he can get you on the right track and I think  many of us in this room have accepted limits    that God didn't put on us we put on ourselves  we've accepted caps that other people have said  
ydZAcANvrkY,3569360,3574560,over this you can't do that you're too young  you're too old God's done with you you messed up  
ydZAcANvrkY,3574560,3580320,you screwed up you missed it you'll never get out  of this we've got to break those limitations off  
ydZAcANvrkY,3581600,3591920,because we've accepted that we can't we won't  and because we won't we'll never realize    that we actually can today is the day  to stir up that hunger to say with  
ydZAcANvrkY,3591920,3596433,God all things are possible I can do all  things through Christ who strengthens me
