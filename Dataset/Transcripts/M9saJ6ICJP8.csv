M9saJ6ICJP8,257756,261552,"First of all, it was such an honor"
M9saJ6ICJP8,261552,264847,I loved how they performed all the songs I love
M9saJ6ICJP8,264847,266931,But what's unfortunate is
M9saJ6ICJP8,266932,270227,"that I didn't get to see them up close,"
M9saJ6ICJP8,270227,274106,"so that's a bit disappointing, but I hope to get to do that next time"
M9saJ6ICJP8,274106,276233,This concert was so much fun
M9saJ6ICJP8,276233,277693,I had so much fun

M9saJ6ICJP8,281781,284992,"Finally, today is the day of our Coachella performance"
M9saJ6ICJP8,284992,286953,"But yesterday,"
M9saJ6ICJP8,286953,289372,"so, I roomed with WINTER"
M9saJ6ICJP8,289372,293209,"She and I turned on the heater,"
M9saJ6ICJP8,293209,294669,but we saw in the morning
M9saJ6ICJP8,294669,296837,and it may have been cold wind
M9saJ6ICJP8,296837,299340,"Anyway, so we both wore hoodies to sleep yesterday"
M9saJ6ICJP8,299341,301885,I'm going to make my hair straight today
M9saJ6ICJP8,302969,304512,I realized it was straight yesterday too
M9saJ6ICJP8,304512,306139,when I went to Coachella
M9saJ6ICJP8,306139,310309,Coachella...
M9saJ6ICJP8,310309,311727,You need straight hair for Coachella
M9saJ6ICJP8,311727,312436,(Haha)
M9saJ6ICJP8,313271,315773,The inside of the hotel is really complicated
M9saJ6ICJP8,315774,316483,"So, jewelries..."
M9saJ6ICJP8,316483,318443,Hello
M9saJ6ICJP8,318443,319069,(Hehe)

M9saJ6ICJP8,327577,328537,I'm pretty shy...
M9saJ6ICJP8,328537,329955,I get shy
M9saJ6ICJP8,330205,332164,"Actually, I'm not really shy"
M9saJ6ICJP8,332165,333500,But it's just embarrassing
M9saJ6ICJP8,333500,336002,when people see you filming
M9saJ6ICJP8,336002,339256,"Obviously, I'm not saying I'm embarrassed"
M9saJ6ICJP8,339256,341091,that I'm filming this for you
M9saJ6ICJP8,341091,342884,Okay
M9saJ6ICJP8,342884,345679,The reason I turned on the self-cam again is
M9saJ6ICJP8,345679,349932,I got back to my room after I finished getting my hair and make up done
M9saJ6ICJP8,350642,353520,I wanted to show you the view outside
M9saJ6ICJP8,353520,356189,(Outside)
M9saJ6ICJP8,356690,359067,"You've never seen a golf course view, have you?"

M9saJ6ICJP8,426509,429220,Did she lose her way?
M9saJ6ICJP8,430388,433766,This sounds a bit like WINTER's footsteps
