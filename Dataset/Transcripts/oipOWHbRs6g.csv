oipOWHbRs6g,0,1760,hey guys it's carl welcome back to
oipOWHbRs6g,1760,3840,another budget tech episode this is the
oipOWHbRs6g,3840,6480,first of the summer in 2022 i'm actually
oipOWHbRs6g,6480,9679,going to wwdc tomorrow or by the time
oipOWHbRs6g,9679,10960,this video is live so a lot of this
oipOWHbRs6g,10960,13519,stuff will focus on maybe some of those
oipOWHbRs6g,13519,14799,accessories because it's impossible to
oipOWHbRs6g,14799,17920,get an item under 50 from apple but the
oipOWHbRs6g,17920,19600,best part you can win one of the items
oipOWHbRs6g,19600,21520,from today i'm still dealing with a lot
oipOWHbRs6g,21520,23199,of the spam of youtube but just leave a
oipOWHbRs6g,23199,24880,comment but more importantly follow me
oipOWHbRs6g,24880,26880,over on social instagram as that's where
oipOWHbRs6g,26880,28800,i usually dm the people and one of these
oipOWHbRs6g,28800,31679,items is on the way we'll get to the
oipOWHbRs6g,31679,33360,first one which you can kind of see off
oipOWHbRs6g,33360,35840,to here it's obviously not a new phone
oipOWHbRs6g,35840,39120,these are the new 13 13 pro in the new
oipOWHbRs6g,39120,41760,green colorways but the first thing that
oipOWHbRs6g,41760,44079,i do for every single phone not just
oipOWHbRs6g,44079,45600,iphones that i get
oipOWHbRs6g,45600,47039,is stick this on which you can't
oipOWHbRs6g,47039,49440,probably see right here but it is a
oipOWHbRs6g,49440,51039,screen protector i am someone that
oipOWHbRs6g,51039,53280,always rocks my phones naked probably
oipOWHbRs6g,53280,55039,because i get a ton and i just feel like
oipOWHbRs6g,55039,55840,they
oipOWHbRs6g,55840,57600,have a nicer feel in the hand especially
oipOWHbRs6g,57600,60079,the 13 pro 13 pro max the stainless
oipOWHbRs6g,60079,61600,steel banding around the outside it
oipOWHbRs6g,61600,64158,feels so premium it feels nice but
oipOWHbRs6g,64158,66320,screens have become so prone to
oipOWHbRs6g,66320,68080,scratches apple in particular has
oipOWHbRs6g,68080,69600,something called ceramic shield which
oipOWHbRs6g,69600,71360,makes their glass less prone to
oipOWHbRs6g,71360,72720,shattering when you drop it but it's
oipOWHbRs6g,72720,74880,actually more prone to scratching
oipOWHbRs6g,74880,77200,because the actual glass is softer so
oipOWHbRs6g,77200,79040,every time i just go over to my friends
oipOWHbRs6g,79040,80640,at dbrand i get one of their screen
oipOWHbRs6g,80640,83680,protectors these ones are super easy to
oipOWHbRs6g,83680,85200,apply they come with multiple in the
oipOWHbRs6g,85200,87920,pack they even have this cool little
oipOWHbRs6g,87920,90079,squeegee tool you essentially just line
oipOWHbRs6g,90079,91600,up the glass and the stickers to a new
oipOWHbRs6g,91600,94240,iphone apply it and just squeegee your
oipOWHbRs6g,94240,96240,phone out to get rid of any bubbles and
oipOWHbRs6g,96240,98640,that's why i do prefer flatter edge
oipOWHbRs6g,98640,100880,screens i know the s22 ultra even the
oipOWHbRs6g,100880,103360,pixel 6 pro has that slightly curved
oipOWHbRs6g,103360,105600,screen you can never get to the end with
oipOWHbRs6g,105600,107119,a screen protector but i guess that's
oipOWHbRs6g,107119,109759,the price you pay for curved glass keep
oipOWHbRs6g,109759,112960,your phones protected even my older 13
oipOWHbRs6g,112960,115439,pro max this one in sierra blue the
oipOWHbRs6g,115439,117759,screen is still like new even though the
oipOWHbRs6g,117759,119600,rest of the phone has a lot of dings and
oipOWHbRs6g,119600,122719,scratches but if we do see a low key
oipOWHbRs6g,122719,124560,announcement of a new iphone i don't
oipOWHbRs6g,124560,127439,think we will at dub dub dc make sure
oipOWHbRs6g,127439,130080,you stay protected speaking of green
oipOWHbRs6g,130080,131760,iphones and in particular i think a lot
oipOWHbRs6g,131760,133280,of other brands have come out with green
oipOWHbRs6g,133280,134720,phones this year some other green
oipOWHbRs6g,134720,136560,accessories that you can grab from apple
oipOWHbRs6g,136560,139360,you can of course grab a silicon case or
oipOWHbRs6g,139360,140879,these green
oipOWHbRs6g,140879,143200,smart wallets or the apple wallets these
oipOWHbRs6g,143200,145599,ones just snap onto the back with
oipOWHbRs6g,145599,147599,magsafe and the new generation ones you
oipOWHbRs6g,147599,149520,can actually add those to the find my
oipOWHbRs6g,149520,151360,app so in case you misplace this
oipOWHbRs6g,151360,153120,somewhere leave it
oipOWHbRs6g,153120,155120,at home at a store you can always find
oipOWHbRs6g,155120,157120,them on a map so that's kind of nice
oipOWHbRs6g,157120,159360,it's pretty much like a built-in air tag
oipOWHbRs6g,159360,161519,around 50 bucks once again it is pretty
oipOWHbRs6g,161519,163920,tough finding accessories and what they
oipOWHbRs6g,163920,165840,actually do really really well is their
oipOWHbRs6g,165840,167599,refresh of accessories they're
oipOWHbRs6g,167599,168800,essentially the same thing they just
oipOWHbRs6g,168800,170640,come out in different color ways so this
oipOWHbRs6g,170640,172720,is a new sport watch band i grabbed this
oipOWHbRs6g,172720,175360,one in their newest colorway this is in
oipOWHbRs6g,175360,178560,particular northern blue which is right
oipOWHbRs6g,178560,180319,now replacing this current blue one so i
oipOWHbRs6g,180319,182159,do have the apple watch series seven
oipOWHbRs6g,182159,183920,once again i don't think we're gonna get
oipOWHbRs6g,183920,186239,any new product in the iphone or apple
oipOWHbRs6g,186239,188239,watch space usually we just get software
oipOWHbRs6g,188239,190159,updates but
oipOWHbRs6g,190159,193599,since it is summer new apple watch band
oipOWHbRs6g,193599,195680,that's looking pretty nice and like i
oipOWHbRs6g,195680,197440,said i gotta give huge shout outs to
oipOWHbRs6g,197440,199760,apple for consistently
oipOWHbRs6g,199760,201840,making me spend more money on new bands
oipOWHbRs6g,201840,203440,and i love the fact that you can just
oipOWHbRs6g,203440,205440,swap these out really easily so we'll
oipOWHbRs6g,205440,208319,just take this switch that on and we
oipOWHbRs6g,208319,209920,will quickly
oipOWHbRs6g,209920,212799,slap that on the wrist that's looking
oipOWHbRs6g,212799,214879,pretty fresh the blue on blue with the
oipOWHbRs6g,214879,217840,series 7 in the blue aluminum i did get
oipOWHbRs6g,217840,220159,apple and once again spending money
oipOWHbRs6g,220159,222159,under 50 bucks but it's always nice to
oipOWHbRs6g,222159,224959,swap out your accessories onto this cool
oipOWHbRs6g,224959,226879,little package that nintendo and
oipOWHbRs6g,226879,228480,actually pokemon sent me i think to do
oipOWHbRs6g,228480,230400,with their new games coming out in
oipOWHbRs6g,230400,233280,november scarlett and violet
oipOWHbRs6g,233280,234640,a lot of people are saying that it's
oipOWHbRs6g,234640,236879,going to be the best game a lot of open
oipOWHbRs6g,236879,238840,worldness nick is a big
oipOWHbRs6g,238840,241519,fan it's gonna be like an open world
oipOWHbRs6g,241519,244159,zelda meets pokemon breath of the wild
oipOWHbRs6g,244159,246480,times pokemon i don't think to the scale
oipOWHbRs6g,246480,248319,of breath of the wild but bigger than
oipOWHbRs6g,248319,251280,anything we've seen before
oipOWHbRs6g,251280,252799,you heard it here first bigger than
oipOWHbRs6g,252799,254239,anything we've seen if there are any big
oipOWHbRs6g,254239,257040,pokemon fans i'm still an og pokemon guy
oipOWHbRs6g,257040,258880,and i mean that by saying just the
oipOWHbRs6g,258880,261600,original 150 i kind of lost track uh
oipOWHbRs6g,261600,263840,after they've come out with
oipOWHbRs6g,263840,265520,that how many pokemon are they nick uh
oipOWHbRs6g,265520,267199,almost a thousand well a little over a
oipOWHbRs6g,267199,268240,thousand if you include all the
oipOWHbRs6g,268240,270560,different forms
oipOWHbRs6g,270560,271680,too many
oipOWHbRs6g,271680,273600,too many to remember but these are a
oipOWHbRs6g,273600,275360,pretty cool pair of headphones from
oipOWHbRs6g,275360,277520,grado when i did look online these were
oipOWHbRs6g,277520,279600,over 50 bucks but i do know that prime
oipOWHbRs6g,279600,281440,day is coming up so if you can snag
oipOWHbRs6g,281440,283919,these for 50 especially if they still
oipOWHbRs6g,283919,285199,come out with these limited edition
oipOWHbRs6g,285199,286560,pokemon ones so you can see the little
oipOWHbRs6g,286560,289840,pokeball and pokemon center times grado
oipOWHbRs6g,289840,293040,labs that looks pretty fresh
oipOWHbRs6g,293040,294880,if you're a big pokemon fan and want to
oipOWHbRs6g,294880,297840,rock some headphones
oipOWHbRs6g,298720,301680,that's pretty dope speaking of gaming
oipOWHbRs6g,301680,303840,under 50 bucks or around that 50 mark
oipOWHbRs6g,303840,306160,the new star wars lego game you can snag
oipOWHbRs6g,306160,308400,that for 49 right now so i am rocking
oipOWHbRs6g,308400,310560,that a lot on my switch
oipOWHbRs6g,310560,312400,it's just kind of fun to relive i'm a
oipOWHbRs6g,312400,314960,big lego fan if you can't tell i've just
oipOWHbRs6g,314960,316639,got star wars lego everywhere so it's
oipOWHbRs6g,316639,318479,fun to kind of play through the series
oipOWHbRs6g,318479,320800,again a lot of nice like dialogue it's
oipOWHbRs6g,320800,322639,cute it's fun and something that i'll be
oipOWHbRs6g,322639,324639,playing probably on the plane over to
oipOWHbRs6g,324639,327280,wwdc one thing that i have upgraded
oipOWHbRs6g,327280,328560,actually from my switch even though i
oipOWHbRs6g,328560,330080,still have the og
oipOWHbRs6g,330080,332720,my memory card slot at the bottom has
oipOWHbRs6g,332720,334479,been filling up so i just got this new
oipOWHbRs6g,334479,337520,one terabyte card this one in particular
oipOWHbRs6g,337520,339199,is from lexar so i actually just got a
oipOWHbRs6g,339199,341039,couple so i can just kind of swap them
oipOWHbRs6g,341039,343199,out continuously on my switch and any
oipOWHbRs6g,343199,345759,phones that do still support micro sd
oipOWHbRs6g,345759,347600,cards like the new sony phone which i
oipOWHbRs6g,347600,349520,just reviewed one of my favorites i
oipOWHbRs6g,349520,352160,still popped one of these in sadly i
oipOWHbRs6g,352160,353840,don't think we'll ever see micro sd card
oipOWHbRs6g,353840,356240,support on an apple device but one can
oipOWHbRs6g,356240,358880,always dream speaking of sd cards one
oipOWHbRs6g,358880,360960,thing that we'll be shooting with at wwc
oipOWHbRs6g,360960,362319,for all of the content that you guys
oipOWHbRs6g,362319,364160,will see on the channel we have upgraded
oipOWHbRs6g,364160,366000,all of our sd cards on our main cam so
oipOWHbRs6g,366000,369520,recording a7 s3s and an a74 a lot of
oipOWHbRs6g,369520,370720,camera gear that we'll be bringing
oipOWHbRs6g,370720,372639,because we just want to showcase what's
oipOWHbRs6g,372639,374639,uh kind of coming out apple is notorious
oipOWHbRs6g,374639,376639,for being really cryptic on what is
oipOWHbRs6g,376639,377840,actually being released i know that
oipOWHbRs6g,377840,379840,there's leaks there's rumors but even
oipOWHbRs6g,379840,381680,the day before or as this video goes
oipOWHbRs6g,381680,384960,live when we're in cupertino at uh steve
oipOWHbRs6g,384960,388080,jobs theater i still do not know what is
oipOWHbRs6g,388080,390000,officially being launched so we just
oipOWHbRs6g,390000,391840,want to ensure we have a ton of storage
oipOWHbRs6g,391840,393840,for all our footage if there's anything
oipOWHbRs6g,393840,395600,that you guys want to see let me know uh
oipOWHbRs6g,395600,398160,in the comments and we will try to
oipOWHbRs6g,398160,399919,record it at all and finally going
oipOWHbRs6g,399919,401680,through the rest of our tech travel pack
oipOWHbRs6g,401680,403120,looking at all the gear we'll be taking
oipOWHbRs6g,403120,404960,most of the stuff is over 50 bucks but
oipOWHbRs6g,404960,407039,this caught my eye just kind of picked
oipOWHbRs6g,407039,409840,this up this is the lonzi key light so
oipOWHbRs6g,409840,411520,this is just a portable light we're not
oipOWHbRs6g,411520,413199,too sure which shooting conditions we'll
oipOWHbRs6g,413199,415599,be shooting in in case we are somewhere
oipOWHbRs6g,415599,417599,that needs a bit more brightness or some
oipOWHbRs6g,417599,419120,light this
oipOWHbRs6g,419120,422479,as you can see boosts up and
oipOWHbRs6g,422479,424800,gives you some pretty decent and
oipOWHbRs6g,424800,426919,adequate light so this is around
oipOWHbRs6g,426919,429680,50.45 i believe if i remember ordering
oipOWHbRs6g,429680,431680,from amazon this is actually bi-color
oipOWHbRs6g,431680,434240,led so you can get from 2500 kelvin all
oipOWHbRs6g,434240,437039,the way up to 9000 you can decrease the
oipOWHbRs6g,437039,439039,brightness with this little toggle on
oipOWHbRs6g,439039,441280,the side and it does come with this
oipOWHbRs6g,441280,443120,little gel package which i like which
oipOWHbRs6g,443120,445599,gives you really really soft light
oipOWHbRs6g,445599,447520,obviously you can remove it and just
oipOWHbRs6g,447520,449599,have a bit more harshness so depending
oipOWHbRs6g,449599,451520,on the look that you want to get and in
oipOWHbRs6g,451520,453120,terms of battery life you're looking at
oipOWHbRs6g,453120,455599,90 minutes on a full charge and that's
oipOWHbRs6g,455599,456800,at 100
oipOWHbRs6g,456800,459039,and obviously as you dial it down to say
oipOWHbRs6g,459039,461759,20 30 brightness you can get longer and
oipOWHbRs6g,461759,463919,what's nice usbc to charge so you don't
oipOWHbRs6g,463919,466639,need micro usb which is pretty
oipOWHbRs6g,466639,468960,antiquated it's old and just nice to
oipOWHbRs6g,468960,471520,keep all of my accessories pretty pretty
oipOWHbRs6g,471520,473120,modern and this will just kind of pop
oipOWHbRs6g,473120,474800,into my bag and what's actually kind of
oipOWHbRs6g,474800,476879,cool which it's not what it's advertised
oipOWHbRs6g,476879,479120,for this gel gives it a bit of cushion
oipOWHbRs6g,479120,480960,just because we kind of toss around into
oipOWHbRs6g,480960,483520,our bag so it's protected it's safe and
oipOWHbRs6g,483520,485919,it's just a little reliable piece of kit
oipOWHbRs6g,485919,488240,that we've added to the arsenal there
oipOWHbRs6g,488240,489680,are a couple other things that we got
oipOWHbRs6g,489680,492000,into the studio around that 50 mark so
oipOWHbRs6g,492000,495199,the first one is this new death outer v2
oipOWHbRs6g,495199,497680,mouse technically isn't new but just
oipOWHbRs6g,497680,500400,because it has this cool halo colorway
oipOWHbRs6g,500400,503199,on it this one in particular it isn't 50
oipOWHbRs6g,503199,504960,if you don't mind getting a non-halo
oipOWHbRs6g,504960,506800,version you can snag that off amazon for
oipOWHbRs6g,506800,509120,45 bucks i don't care what any people
oipOWHbRs6g,509120,512000,say about wireless mice just give me a
oipOWHbRs6g,512000,513680,good old wired mouse i know it doesn't
oipOWHbRs6g,513680,516479,look as clean but the performance on it
oipOWHbRs6g,516479,519039,you just can't beat a wired connection
oipOWHbRs6g,519039,521518,so the v2 is significantly lighter than
oipOWHbRs6g,521518,524159,obviously v1 this is 82 grams versus
oipOWHbRs6g,524159,526959,105. you've got eight programmable
oipOWHbRs6g,526959,528800,buttons and you can map those to five
oipOWHbRs6g,528800,530800,different profiles it's pretty much just
oipOWHbRs6g,530800,532720,a mouse that works out of the box and
oipOWHbRs6g,532720,535360,i'd rather grab a razor mouse versus one
oipOWHbRs6g,535360,537279,of those amazon knockoffs that are still
oipOWHbRs6g,537279,540320,around 20 30 bucks spend the 20 extra
oipOWHbRs6g,540320,543680,get a known brand and one that will work
oipOWHbRs6g,543680,545200,all the time and once again you can just
oipOWHbRs6g,545200,546800,stick this into a backpack it's great to
oipOWHbRs6g,546800,548480,have as a second mouse
oipOWHbRs6g,548480,550240,or if you're just really into gaming and
oipOWHbRs6g,550240,553120,don't want to break the bank
oipOWHbRs6g,553120,555440,solid the next item we're keeping it in
oipOWHbRs6g,555440,556880,the razer game we're showing them a lot
oipOWHbRs6g,556880,558720,of love on this episode maybe because
oipOWHbRs6g,558720,560240,they released their barracuda pro
oipOWHbRs6g,560240,563040,headphones those cost 250 dollars not in
oipOWHbRs6g,563040,565120,this particular video but these are just
oipOWHbRs6g,565120,566880,simple controller stands the main
oipOWHbRs6g,566880,568160,function they actually charge your
oipOWHbRs6g,568160,570880,controllers whether that's ps5 or the
oipOWHbRs6g,570880,574080,xbox whatever your deathly choices or if
oipOWHbRs6g,574080,576720,you're even pc whatever you might jive
oipOWHbRs6g,576720,578880,with but these also come in different
oipOWHbRs6g,578880,580399,color options as well you can see we've
oipOWHbRs6g,580399,582320,just got the black on black but i know
oipOWHbRs6g,582320,584560,on the xbox side you have more color
oipOWHbRs6g,584560,586240,choices so these are just fun little
oipOWHbRs6g,586240,588000,ways to keep your controllers off the
oipOWHbRs6g,588000,590240,desk and you'll never need to replace
oipOWHbRs6g,590240,591760,batteries i'm looking at you xbox
oipOWHbRs6g,591760,593440,controllers i know that playstation 5
oipOWHbRs6g,593440,595519,controllers way superior they're way
oipOWHbRs6g,595519,597440,better it's how a controller should
oipOWHbRs6g,597440,600320,charge but for whatever reason we still
oipOWHbRs6g,600320,602000,see xbox
oipOWHbRs6g,602000,604399,on the double a batteries even though i
oipOWHbRs6g,604399,606959,just threw some shade at uxbox
oipOWHbRs6g,606959,608800,i still kind of love you guys and i am
oipOWHbRs6g,608800,612320,giving away a month of xbox game pass
oipOWHbRs6g,612320,613600,this is just a little brick that i
oipOWHbRs6g,613600,615360,pulled out from my little jenga block
oipOWHbRs6g,615360,617760,whoever snags this first let me know
oipOWHbRs6g,617760,619839,you've just got a month free game pass
oipOWHbRs6g,619839,621839,last off we'll finish off with a couple
oipOWHbRs6g,621839,623040,things i know i'm not really tech
oipOWHbRs6g,623040,625279,related but i am getting into golf a lot
oipOWHbRs6g,625279,626800,more this summer and it's just kind of
oipOWHbRs6g,626800,629279,my new sport in general i know that golf
oipOWHbRs6g,629279,630880,is probably one of the most expensive
oipOWHbRs6g,630880,633600,sports maybe only that in formula one is
oipOWHbRs6g,633600,636000,probably more expensive but there are
oipOWHbRs6g,636000,638000,ways to keep things on budget the first
oipOWHbRs6g,638000,640640,one i am team taylormade they help out
oipOWHbRs6g,640640,642560,and send me all their stuff but these
oipOWHbRs6g,642560,643920,head covers
oipOWHbRs6g,643920,645680,should cost you less than 50 maybe not
oipOWHbRs6g,645680,647279,this orange one in particular there's
oipOWHbRs6g,647279,650720,ones that range between 20 to 45 dollars
oipOWHbRs6g,650720,653120,just something to keep your putter
oipOWHbRs6g,653120,654640,covered in when you think about it you
oipOWHbRs6g,654640,656320,could just probably use a sock to do the
oipOWHbRs6g,656320,658480,same thing but um had to just keep
oipOWHbRs6g,658480,660880,things all orange and even though i am
oipOWHbRs6g,660880,662800,sponsored by taylormade i
oipOWHbRs6g,662800,665120,die a bit inside because i'm so at
oipOWHbRs6g,665120,667440,golf when i shank a ball into the woods
oipOWHbRs6g,667440,668640,into the water
oipOWHbRs6g,668640,671680,those are like four dollar tp5s that uh
oipOWHbRs6g,671680,675040,i continuously lose my heart just can't
oipOWHbRs6g,675040,677680,bear it so i just bought this basic pack
oipOWHbRs6g,677680,680320,of balls i think this is 15 20 bucks
oipOWHbRs6g,680320,683200,these are just nitro balls i of course
oipOWHbRs6g,683200,685200,got them in orange once again i just
oipOWHbRs6g,685200,687680,don't care if i lose these if i shank
oipOWHbRs6g,687680,690800,them if i lose 10 of them in a round i
oipOWHbRs6g,690800,692640,won't die on the inside obviously they
oipOWHbRs6g,692640,695120,just don't have the same feel or as nice
oipOWHbRs6g,695120,698000,as a tp5 but for just something that i'm
oipOWHbRs6g,698000,700320,driving off of or i'm just shanking and
oipOWHbRs6g,700320,701839,losing just trying to keep things on
oipOWHbRs6g,701839,704320,budget and um making the game a bit more
oipOWHbRs6g,704320,706160,accessible and just cheaper in general
oipOWHbRs6g,706160,708160,hope you guys enjoy this episode like i
oipOWHbRs6g,708160,710480,said we are heading off to wwdc by the
oipOWHbRs6g,710480,711680,time you're watching this video we
oipOWHbRs6g,711680,713760,should already be in cupertino so if
oipOWHbRs6g,713760,716480,there's anything you want to get covered
oipOWHbRs6g,716480,718160,if there are any undercover leaks that
oipOWHbRs6g,718160,720240,you guys want to see let me know down

oipOWHbRs6g,723440,724560,you guys enjoy this we're just
oipOWHbRs6g,724560,726399,recovering or i'm particularly
oipOWHbRs6g,726399,728480,recovering from kobit as it hit me
oipOWHbRs6g,728480,730399,harder than i thought just getting
oipOWHbRs6g,730399,733040,content out is a bit of a slog but i
oipOWHbRs6g,733040,734240,hope you guys enjoy it thanks for
oipOWHbRs6g,734240,736000,bearing with me and we'll catch the rest
oipOWHbRs6g,736000,740800,of you in one of my next episodes peace
vid,start,end,text
oipOWHbRs6g,0,1760,hey guys it's carl welcome back to
oipOWHbRs6g,1760,3840,another budget tech episode this is the
oipOWHbRs6g,3840,6480,first of the summer in 2022 i'm actually
oipOWHbRs6g,6480,9679,going to wwdc tomorrow or by the time
oipOWHbRs6g,9679,10960,this video is live so a lot of this
oipOWHbRs6g,10960,13519,stuff will focus on maybe some of those
oipOWHbRs6g,13519,14799,accessories because it's impossible to
oipOWHbRs6g,14799,17920,get an item under 50 from apple but the
oipOWHbRs6g,17920,19600,best part you can win one of the items
oipOWHbRs6g,19600,21520,from today i'm still dealing with a lot
oipOWHbRs6g,21520,23199,of the spam of youtube but just leave a
oipOWHbRs6g,23199,24880,comment but more importantly follow me
oipOWHbRs6g,24880,26880,over on social instagram as that's where
oipOWHbRs6g,26880,28800,i usually dm the people and one of these
oipOWHbRs6g,28800,31679,items is on the way we'll get to the
oipOWHbRs6g,31679,33360,first one which you can kind of see off
oipOWHbRs6g,33360,35840,to here it's obviously not a new phone
oipOWHbRs6g,35840,39120,these are the new 13 13 pro in the new
oipOWHbRs6g,39120,41760,green colorways but the first thing that
oipOWHbRs6g,41760,44079,i do for every single phone not just
oipOWHbRs6g,44079,45600,iphones that i get
oipOWHbRs6g,45600,47039,is stick this on which you can't
oipOWHbRs6g,47039,49440,probably see right here but it is a
oipOWHbRs6g,49440,51039,screen protector i am someone that
oipOWHbRs6g,51039,53280,always rocks my phones naked probably
oipOWHbRs6g,53280,55039,because i get a ton and i just feel like
oipOWHbRs6g,55039,55840,they
oipOWHbRs6g,55840,57600,have a nicer feel in the hand especially
oipOWHbRs6g,57600,60079,the 13 pro 13 pro max the stainless
oipOWHbRs6g,60079,61600,steel banding around the outside it
oipOWHbRs6g,61600,64158,feels so premium it feels nice but
oipOWHbRs6g,64158,66320,screens have become so prone to
oipOWHbRs6g,66320,68080,scratches apple in particular has
oipOWHbRs6g,68080,69600,something called ceramic shield which
oipOWHbRs6g,69600,71360,makes their glass less prone to
oipOWHbRs6g,71360,72720,shattering when you drop it but it's
oipOWHbRs6g,72720,74880,actually more prone to scratching
oipOWHbRs6g,74880,77200,because the actual glass is softer so
oipOWHbRs6g,77200,79040,every time i just go over to my friends
oipOWHbRs6g,79040,80640,at dbrand i get one of their screen
oipOWHbRs6g,80640,83680,protectors these ones are super easy to
oipOWHbRs6g,83680,85200,apply they come with multiple in the
oipOWHbRs6g,85200,87920,pack they even have this cool little
oipOWHbRs6g,87920,90079,squeegee tool you essentially just line
oipOWHbRs6g,90079,91600,up the glass and the stickers to a new
oipOWHbRs6g,91600,94240,iphone apply it and just squeegee your
oipOWHbRs6g,94240,96240,phone out to get rid of any bubbles and
oipOWHbRs6g,96240,98640,that's why i do prefer flatter edge
oipOWHbRs6g,98640,100880,screens i know the s22 ultra even the
oipOWHbRs6g,100880,103360,pixel 6 pro has that slightly curved
oipOWHbRs6g,103360,105600,screen you can never get to the end with
oipOWHbRs6g,105600,107119,a screen protector but i guess that's
oipOWHbRs6g,107119,109759,the price you pay for curved glass keep
oipOWHbRs6g,109759,112960,your phones protected even my older 13
oipOWHbRs6g,112960,115439,pro max this one in sierra blue the
oipOWHbRs6g,115439,117759,screen is still like new even though the
oipOWHbRs6g,117759,119600,rest of the phone has a lot of dings and
oipOWHbRs6g,119600,122719,scratches but if we do see a low key
oipOWHbRs6g,122719,124560,announcement of a new iphone i don't
oipOWHbRs6g,124560,127439,think we will at dub dub dc make sure
oipOWHbRs6g,127439,130080,you stay protected speaking of green
oipOWHbRs6g,130080,131760,iphones and in particular i think a lot
oipOWHbRs6g,131760,133280,of other brands have come out with green
oipOWHbRs6g,133280,134720,phones this year some other green
oipOWHbRs6g,134720,136560,accessories that you can grab from apple
oipOWHbRs6g,136560,139360,you can of course grab a silicon case or
oipOWHbRs6g,139360,140879,these green
oipOWHbRs6g,140879,143200,smart wallets or the apple wallets these
oipOWHbRs6g,143200,145599,ones just snap onto the back with
oipOWHbRs6g,145599,147599,magsafe and the new generation ones you
oipOWHbRs6g,147599,149520,can actually add those to the find my
oipOWHbRs6g,149520,151360,app so in case you misplace this
oipOWHbRs6g,151360,153120,somewhere leave it
oipOWHbRs6g,153120,155120,at home at a store you can always find
oipOWHbRs6g,155120,157120,them on a map so that's kind of nice
oipOWHbRs6g,157120,159360,it's pretty much like a built-in air tag
oipOWHbRs6g,159360,161519,around 50 bucks once again it is pretty
oipOWHbRs6g,161519,163920,tough finding accessories and what they
oipOWHbRs6g,163920,165840,actually do really really well is their
oipOWHbRs6g,165840,167599,refresh of accessories they're
oipOWHbRs6g,167599,168800,essentially the same thing they just
oipOWHbRs6g,168800,170640,come out in different color ways so this
oipOWHbRs6g,170640,172720,is a new sport watch band i grabbed this
oipOWHbRs6g,172720,175360,one in their newest colorway this is in
oipOWHbRs6g,175360,178560,particular northern blue which is right
oipOWHbRs6g,178560,180319,now replacing this current blue one so i
oipOWHbRs6g,180319,182159,do have the apple watch series seven
oipOWHbRs6g,182159,183920,once again i don't think we're gonna get
oipOWHbRs6g,183920,186239,any new product in the iphone or apple
oipOWHbRs6g,186239,188239,watch space usually we just get software
oipOWHbRs6g,188239,190159,updates but
oipOWHbRs6g,190159,193599,since it is summer new apple watch band
oipOWHbRs6g,193599,195680,that's looking pretty nice and like i
oipOWHbRs6g,195680,197440,said i gotta give huge shout outs to
oipOWHbRs6g,197440,199760,apple for consistently
oipOWHbRs6g,199760,201840,making me spend more money on new bands
oipOWHbRs6g,201840,203440,and i love the fact that you can just
oipOWHbRs6g,203440,205440,swap these out really easily so we'll
oipOWHbRs6g,205440,208319,just take this switch that on and we
oipOWHbRs6g,208319,209920,will quickly
oipOWHbRs6g,209920,212799,slap that on the wrist that's looking
oipOWHbRs6g,212799,214879,pretty fresh the blue on blue with the
oipOWHbRs6g,214879,217840,series 7 in the blue aluminum i did get
oipOWHbRs6g,217840,220159,apple and once again spending money
oipOWHbRs6g,220159,222159,under 50 bucks but it's always nice to
oipOWHbRs6g,222159,224959,swap out your accessories onto this cool
oipOWHbRs6g,224959,226879,little package that nintendo and
oipOWHbRs6g,226879,228480,actually pokemon sent me i think to do
oipOWHbRs6g,228480,230400,with their new games coming out in
oipOWHbRs6g,230400,233280,november scarlett and violet
oipOWHbRs6g,233280,234640,a lot of people are saying that it's
oipOWHbRs6g,234640,236879,going to be the best game a lot of open
oipOWHbRs6g,236879,238840,worldness nick is a big
oipOWHbRs6g,238840,241519,fan it's gonna be like an open world
oipOWHbRs6g,241519,244159,zelda meets pokemon breath of the wild
oipOWHbRs6g,244159,246480,times pokemon i don't think to the scale
oipOWHbRs6g,246480,248319,of breath of the wild but bigger than
oipOWHbRs6g,248319,251280,anything we've seen before
oipOWHbRs6g,251280,252799,you heard it here first bigger than
oipOWHbRs6g,252799,254239,anything we've seen if there are any big
oipOWHbRs6g,254239,257040,pokemon fans i'm still an og pokemon guy
oipOWHbRs6g,257040,258880,and i mean that by saying just the
oipOWHbRs6g,258880,261600,original 150 i kind of lost track uh
oipOWHbRs6g,261600,263840,after they've come out with
oipOWHbRs6g,263840,265520,that how many pokemon are they nick uh
oipOWHbRs6g,265520,267199,almost a thousand well a little over a
oipOWHbRs6g,267199,268240,thousand if you include all the
oipOWHbRs6g,268240,270560,different forms
oipOWHbRs6g,270560,271680,too many
oipOWHbRs6g,271680,273600,too many to remember but these are a
oipOWHbRs6g,273600,275360,pretty cool pair of headphones from
oipOWHbRs6g,275360,277520,grado when i did look online these were
oipOWHbRs6g,277520,279600,over 50 bucks but i do know that prime
oipOWHbRs6g,279600,281440,day is coming up so if you can snag
oipOWHbRs6g,281440,283919,these for 50 especially if they still
oipOWHbRs6g,283919,285199,come out with these limited edition
oipOWHbRs6g,285199,286560,pokemon ones so you can see the little
oipOWHbRs6g,286560,289840,pokeball and pokemon center times grado
oipOWHbRs6g,289840,293040,labs that looks pretty fresh
oipOWHbRs6g,293040,294880,if you're a big pokemon fan and want to
oipOWHbRs6g,294880,297840,rock some headphones
oipOWHbRs6g,298720,301680,that's pretty dope speaking of gaming
oipOWHbRs6g,301680,303840,under 50 bucks or around that 50 mark
oipOWHbRs6g,303840,306160,the new star wars lego game you can snag

oipOWHbRs6g,312400,314960,big lego fan if you can't tell i've just
oipOWHbRs6g,314960,316639,got star wars lego everywhere so it's
oipOWHbRs6g,316639,318479,fun to kind of play through the series
oipOWHbRs6g,318479,320800,again a lot of nice like dialogue it's
oipOWHbRs6g,320800,322639,cute it's fun and something that i'll be
oipOWHbRs6g,322639,324639,playing probably on the plane over to
oipOWHbRs6g,324639,327280,wwdc one thing that i have upgraded
oipOWHbRs6g,327280,328560,actually from my switch even though i
oipOWHbRs6g,328560,330080,still have the og
oipOWHbRs6g,330080,332720,my memory card slot at the bottom has
oipOWHbRs6g,332720,334479,been filling up so i just got this new
oipOWHbRs6g,334479,337520,one terabyte card this one in particular
oipOWHbRs6g,337520,339199,is from lexar so i actually just got a
oipOWHbRs6g,339199,341039,couple so i can just kind of swap them
oipOWHbRs6g,341039,343199,out continuously on my switch and any
oipOWHbRs6g,343199,345759,phones that do still support micro sd
oipOWHbRs6g,345759,347600,cards like the new sony phone which i
oipOWHbRs6g,347600,349520,just reviewed one of my favorites i
oipOWHbRs6g,349520,352160,still popped one of these in sadly i
oipOWHbRs6g,352160,353840,don't think we'll ever see micro sd card
oipOWHbRs6g,353840,356240,support on an apple device but one can
oipOWHbRs6g,356240,358880,always dream speaking of sd cards one
oipOWHbRs6g,358880,360960,thing that we'll be shooting with at wwc
oipOWHbRs6g,360960,362319,for all of the content that you guys
oipOWHbRs6g,362319,364160,will see on the channel we have upgraded
oipOWHbRs6g,364160,366000,all of our sd cards on our main cam so
oipOWHbRs6g,366000,369520,recording a7 s3s and an a74 a lot of
oipOWHbRs6g,369520,370720,camera gear that we'll be bringing
oipOWHbRs6g,370720,372639,because we just want to showcase what's
oipOWHbRs6g,372639,374639,uh kind of coming out apple is notorious
oipOWHbRs6g,374639,376639,for being really cryptic on what is
oipOWHbRs6g,376639,377840,actually being released i know that
oipOWHbRs6g,377840,379840,there's leaks there's rumors but even
oipOWHbRs6g,379840,381680,the day before or as this video goes
oipOWHbRs6g,381680,384960,live when we're in cupertino at uh steve
oipOWHbRs6g,384960,388080,jobs theater i still do not know what is
oipOWHbRs6g,388080,390000,officially being launched so we just
oipOWHbRs6g,390000,391840,want to ensure we have a ton of storage
oipOWHbRs6g,391840,393840,for all our footage if there's anything
oipOWHbRs6g,393840,395600,that you guys want to see let me know uh
oipOWHbRs6g,395600,398160,in the comments and we will try to
oipOWHbRs6g,398160,399919,record it at all and finally going
oipOWHbRs6g,399919,401680,through the rest of our tech travel pack
oipOWHbRs6g,401680,403120,looking at all the gear we'll be taking
oipOWHbRs6g,403120,404960,most of the stuff is over 50 bucks but
oipOWHbRs6g,404960,407039,this caught my eye just kind of picked
oipOWHbRs6g,407039,409840,this up this is the lonzi key light so
oipOWHbRs6g,409840,411520,this is just a portable light we're not
oipOWHbRs6g,411520,413199,too sure which shooting conditions we'll
oipOWHbRs6g,413199,415599,be shooting in in case we are somewhere
oipOWHbRs6g,415599,417599,that needs a bit more brightness or some
oipOWHbRs6g,417599,419120,light this
oipOWHbRs6g,419120,422479,as you can see boosts up and
oipOWHbRs6g,422479,424800,gives you some pretty decent and
oipOWHbRs6g,424800,426919,adequate light so this is around
oipOWHbRs6g,426919,429680,50.45 i believe if i remember ordering
oipOWHbRs6g,429680,431680,from amazon this is actually bi-color
oipOWHbRs6g,431680,434240,led so you can get from 2500 kelvin all
oipOWHbRs6g,434240,437039,the way up to 9000 you can decrease the
oipOWHbRs6g,437039,439039,brightness with this little toggle on
oipOWHbRs6g,439039,441280,the side and it does come with this
oipOWHbRs6g,441280,443120,little gel package which i like which
oipOWHbRs6g,443120,445599,gives you really really soft light
oipOWHbRs6g,445599,447520,obviously you can remove it and just
oipOWHbRs6g,447520,449599,have a bit more harshness so depending
oipOWHbRs6g,449599,451520,on the look that you want to get and in
oipOWHbRs6g,451520,453120,terms of battery life you're looking at
oipOWHbRs6g,453120,455599,90 minutes on a full charge and that's
oipOWHbRs6g,455599,456800,at 100
oipOWHbRs6g,456800,459039,and obviously as you dial it down to say
oipOWHbRs6g,459039,461759,20 30 brightness you can get longer and
oipOWHbRs6g,461759,463919,what's nice usbc to charge so you don't
oipOWHbRs6g,463919,466639,need micro usb which is pretty
oipOWHbRs6g,466639,468960,antiquated it's old and just nice to
oipOWHbRs6g,468960,471520,keep all of my accessories pretty pretty
oipOWHbRs6g,471520,473120,modern and this will just kind of pop
oipOWHbRs6g,473120,474800,into my bag and what's actually kind of
oipOWHbRs6g,474800,476879,cool which it's not what it's advertised
oipOWHbRs6g,476879,479120,for this gel gives it a bit of cushion
oipOWHbRs6g,479120,480960,just because we kind of toss around into
oipOWHbRs6g,480960,483520,our bag so it's protected it's safe and
oipOWHbRs6g,483520,485919,it's just a little reliable piece of kit
oipOWHbRs6g,485919,488240,that we've added to the arsenal there
oipOWHbRs6g,488240,489680,are a couple other things that we got
oipOWHbRs6g,489680,492000,into the studio around that 50 mark so
oipOWHbRs6g,492000,495199,the first one is this new death outer v2
oipOWHbRs6g,495199,497680,mouse technically isn't new but just
oipOWHbRs6g,497680,500400,because it has this cool halo colorway
oipOWHbRs6g,500400,503199,on it this one in particular it isn't 50
oipOWHbRs6g,503199,504960,if you don't mind getting a non-halo
oipOWHbRs6g,504960,506800,version you can snag that off amazon for
oipOWHbRs6g,506800,509120,45 bucks i don't care what any people
oipOWHbRs6g,509120,512000,say about wireless mice just give me a
oipOWHbRs6g,512000,513680,good old wired mouse i know it doesn't
oipOWHbRs6g,513680,516479,look as clean but the performance on it
oipOWHbRs6g,516479,519039,you just can't beat a wired connection
oipOWHbRs6g,519039,521518,so the v2 is significantly lighter than
oipOWHbRs6g,521518,524159,obviously v1 this is 82 grams versus
oipOWHbRs6g,524159,526959,105. you've got eight programmable
oipOWHbRs6g,526959,528800,buttons and you can map those to five
oipOWHbRs6g,528800,530800,different profiles it's pretty much just
oipOWHbRs6g,530800,532720,a mouse that works out of the box and
oipOWHbRs6g,532720,535360,i'd rather grab a razor mouse versus one
oipOWHbRs6g,535360,537279,of those amazon knockoffs that are still
oipOWHbRs6g,537279,540320,around 20 30 bucks spend the 20 extra
oipOWHbRs6g,540320,543680,get a known brand and one that will work
oipOWHbRs6g,543680,545200,all the time and once again you can just
oipOWHbRs6g,545200,546800,stick this into a backpack it's great to
oipOWHbRs6g,546800,548480,have as a second mouse
oipOWHbRs6g,548480,550240,or if you're just really into gaming and
oipOWHbRs6g,550240,553120,don't want to break the bank
oipOWHbRs6g,553120,555440,solid the next item we're keeping it in
oipOWHbRs6g,555440,556880,the razer game we're showing them a lot
oipOWHbRs6g,556880,558720,of love on this episode maybe because
oipOWHbRs6g,558720,560240,they released their barracuda pro
oipOWHbRs6g,560240,563040,headphones those cost 250 dollars not in
oipOWHbRs6g,563040,565120,this particular video but these are just
oipOWHbRs6g,565120,566880,simple controller stands the main
oipOWHbRs6g,566880,568160,function they actually charge your
oipOWHbRs6g,568160,570880,controllers whether that's ps5 or the
oipOWHbRs6g,570880,574080,xbox whatever your deathly choices or if
oipOWHbRs6g,574080,576720,you're even pc whatever you might jive
oipOWHbRs6g,576720,578880,with but these also come in different
oipOWHbRs6g,578880,580399,color options as well you can see we've
oipOWHbRs6g,580399,582320,just got the black on black but i know
oipOWHbRs6g,582320,584560,on the xbox side you have more color
oipOWHbRs6g,584560,586240,choices so these are just fun little
oipOWHbRs6g,586240,588000,ways to keep your controllers off the
oipOWHbRs6g,588000,590240,desk and you'll never need to replace
oipOWHbRs6g,590240,591760,batteries i'm looking at you xbox
oipOWHbRs6g,591760,593440,controllers i know that playstation 5
oipOWHbRs6g,593440,595519,controllers way superior they're way
oipOWHbRs6g,595519,597440,better it's how a controller should
oipOWHbRs6g,597440,600320,charge but for whatever reason we still
oipOWHbRs6g,600320,602000,see xbox
oipOWHbRs6g,602000,604399,on the double a batteries even though i
oipOWHbRs6g,604399,606959,just threw some shade at uxbox
oipOWHbRs6g,606959,608800,i still kind of love you guys and i am
oipOWHbRs6g,608800,612320,giving away a month of xbox game pass
oipOWHbRs6g,612320,613600,this is just a little brick that i
oipOWHbRs6g,613600,615360,pulled out from my little jenga block
oipOWHbRs6g,615360,617760,whoever snags this first let me know
oipOWHbRs6g,617760,619839,you've just got a month free game pass
oipOWHbRs6g,619839,621839,last off we'll finish off with a couple
oipOWHbRs6g,621839,623040,things i know i'm not really tech
oipOWHbRs6g,623040,625279,related but i am getting into golf a lot
oipOWHbRs6g,625279,626800,more this summer and it's just kind of
oipOWHbRs6g,626800,629279,my new sport in general i know that golf
oipOWHbRs6g,629279,630880,is probably one of the most expensive
oipOWHbRs6g,630880,633600,sports maybe only that in formula one is
oipOWHbRs6g,633600,636000,probably more expensive but there are
oipOWHbRs6g,636000,638000,ways to keep things on budget the first
oipOWHbRs6g,638000,640640,one i am team taylormade they help out
oipOWHbRs6g,640640,642560,and send me all their stuff but these
oipOWHbRs6g,642560,643920,head covers
oipOWHbRs6g,643920,645680,should cost you less than 50 maybe not
oipOWHbRs6g,645680,647279,this orange one in particular there's
oipOWHbRs6g,647279,650720,ones that range between 20 to 45 dollars
oipOWHbRs6g,650720,653120,just something to keep your putter
oipOWHbRs6g,653120,654640,covered in when you think about it you
oipOWHbRs6g,654640,656320,could just probably use a sock to do the
oipOWHbRs6g,656320,658480,same thing but um had to just keep
oipOWHbRs6g,658480,660880,things all orange and even though i am
oipOWHbRs6g,660880,662800,sponsored by taylormade i
oipOWHbRs6g,662800,665120,die a bit inside because i'm so at
oipOWHbRs6g,665120,667440,golf when i shank a ball into the woods
oipOWHbRs6g,667440,668640,into the water
oipOWHbRs6g,668640,671680,those are like four dollar tp5s that uh
oipOWHbRs6g,671680,675040,i continuously lose my heart just can't
oipOWHbRs6g,675040,677680,bear it so i just bought this basic pack
oipOWHbRs6g,677680,680320,of balls i think this is 15 20 bucks
oipOWHbRs6g,680320,683200,these are just nitro balls i of course
oipOWHbRs6g,683200,685200,got them in orange once again i just
oipOWHbRs6g,685200,687680,don't care if i lose these if i shank
oipOWHbRs6g,687680,690800,them if i lose 10 of them in a round i
oipOWHbRs6g,690800,692640,won't die on the inside obviously they
oipOWHbRs6g,692640,695120,just don't have the same feel or as nice
oipOWHbRs6g,695120,698000,as a tp5 but for just something that i'm
oipOWHbRs6g,698000,700320,driving off of or i'm just shanking and
oipOWHbRs6g,700320,701839,losing just trying to keep things on
oipOWHbRs6g,701839,704320,budget and um making the game a bit more
oipOWHbRs6g,704320,706160,accessible and just cheaper in general
oipOWHbRs6g,706160,708160,hope you guys enjoy this episode like i
oipOWHbRs6g,708160,710480,said we are heading off to wwdc by the
oipOWHbRs6g,710480,711680,time you're watching this video we
oipOWHbRs6g,711680,713760,should already be in cupertino so if
oipOWHbRs6g,713760,716480,there's anything you want to get covered

oipOWHbRs6g,724560,726399,recovering or i'm particularly
oipOWHbRs6g,726399,728480,recovering from kobit as it hit me
oipOWHbRs6g,728480,730399,harder than i thought just getting
oipOWHbRs6g,730399,733040,content out is a bit of a slog but i
