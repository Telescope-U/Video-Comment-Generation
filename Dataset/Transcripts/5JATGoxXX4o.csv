5JATGoxXX4o,0,2159,so it's been three days since the m2
5JATGoxXX4o,2159,5359,macbook pro came out and we have done a
5JATGoxXX4o,5359,8320,ton of tests and comparisons and put out
5JATGoxXX4o,8320,11200,multiple videos in this one i want to
5JATGoxXX4o,11200,13679,give you guys a short video about the
5JATGoxXX4o,13679,17440,good the bad and the outright ugly about
5JATGoxXX4o,17440,21439,this laptop and my perspective for real
5JATGoxXX4o,21439,24480,world use with this laptop instead of
5JATGoxXX4o,24480,27519,just benchmarks now the first thing for
5JATGoxXX4o,27519,29519,a positive that i want to talk about is
5JATGoxXX4o,29519,31519,the webcam now a lot of people have
5JATGoxXX4o,31519,33680,really hated on apple for sticking with
5JATGoxXX4o,33680,36480,the 720p webcam and i agree they should
5JATGoxXX4o,36480,39600,have put a 1080p in but it does look
5JATGoxXX4o,39600,41840,better now the weird thing is is that
5JATGoxXX4o,41840,44000,it's only better because of software
5JATGoxXX4o,44000,45680,they tweaked the algorithm for the noise
5JATGoxXX4o,45680,48160,reduction they added better contrast or
5JATGoxXX4o,48160,50160,else that's what it looks like now with
5JATGoxXX4o,50160,52399,that the 14 inch and 16 inch and even
5JATGoxXX4o,52399,54879,the upcoming m2 macbook air are still
5JATGoxXX4o,54879,57600,going to look more detailed sharper less
5JATGoxXX4o,57600,58480,noise
5JATGoxXX4o,58480,60239,but at least they've done the software
5JATGoxXX4o,60239,62559,fix which they should do to the previous
5JATGoxXX4o,62559,65280,ones to make it look a little bit better
5JATGoxXX4o,65280,67760,now the second thing that i noticed is
5JATGoxXX4o,67760,70080,the speakers now in my comparison
5JATGoxXX4o,70080,72560,against the m1 macbook pro i said that
5JATGoxXX4o,72560,74960,they sound about the same i couldn't
5JATGoxXX4o,74960,77200,hear much of a difference but then some
5JATGoxXX4o,77200,78799,of you guys called it out and said that
5JATGoxXX4o,78799,81280,no in fact the m1 has better dynamics it
5JATGoxXX4o,81280,84240,sounds better and the truth is when we
5JATGoxXX4o,84240,86240,were listening i told him that i thought
5JATGoxXX4o,86240,88000,that the bass was better on the m1 and
5JATGoxXX4o,88000,89759,it sounded slightly louder it just
5JATGoxXX4o,89759,91759,didn't make sense why that would happen
5JATGoxXX4o,91759,94240,and because i was unsure i was just
5JATGoxXX4o,94240,96000,leaving it up to you guys but you guys
5JATGoxXX4o,96000,98640,spoke and with that when we monitored in
5JATGoxXX4o,98640,100799,final cut it did show about a two
5JATGoxXX4o,100799,104880,decibels louder kind of volume on the m1
5JATGoxXX4o,104880,107360,model so i don't know why the m2 doesn't
5JATGoxXX4o,107360,109920,sound as good the m1 already was the
5JATGoxXX4o,109920,112640,worst sounding macbook out of the full
5JATGoxXX4o,112640,115439,lineup so that is definitely unfortunate
5JATGoxXX4o,115439,118560,now the next thing is the fan
5JATGoxXX4o,118560,121280,now this thing when you're using it day
5JATGoxXX4o,121280,122320,to day
5JATGoxXX4o,122320,125360,it almost seems like a macbook air that
5JATGoxXX4o,125360,126799,is fanless
5JATGoxXX4o,126799,129759,you don't hear it unless you're doing
5JATGoxXX4o,129759,132560,heavy rendering for a very long time and
5JATGoxXX4o,132560,134000,i'm not talking about running a couple
5JATGoxXX4o,134000,136400,runs of cinebench it still is silent
5JATGoxXX4o,136400,138720,apple let this thing heat up the most we
5JATGoxXX4o,138720,140879,recorded is 104 on screen but actually
5JATGoxXX4o,140879,142480,hit 105
5JATGoxXX4o,142480,144480,and they didn't care the fans only
5JATGoxXX4o,144480,146800,barely started to ram up ramp up there
5JATGoxXX4o,146800,148319,so they're treating it more like a
5JATGoxXX4o,148319,150800,macbook air instead of a pro whereas the
5JATGoxXX4o,150800,154080,m1 pro even though it uses less power
5JATGoxXX4o,154080,156720,and less wattage and has less heat the
5JATGoxXX4o,156720,160000,fans actually ramp up quicker now that
5JATGoxXX4o,160000,162239,is a positive if you don't want to hear
5JATGoxXX4o,162239,163599,the fans day to day if you have a
5JATGoxXX4o,163599,166319,previous intel model and you're annoyed
5JATGoxXX4o,166319,168319,of it well this is going to be way
5JATGoxXX4o,168319,169920,better it's a great experience not
5JATGoxXX4o,169920,171680,hearing that fan but for those of you
5JATGoxXX4o,171680,174400,guys that are concerned about the high
5JATGoxXX4o,174400,175280,heat
5JATGoxXX4o,175280,177440,that the chip gets and how hot it gets
5JATGoxXX4o,177440,179680,well you could download tg fan pro and
5JATGoxXX4o,179680,181920,you can change the settings yourself to
5JATGoxXX4o,181920,183680,have it spin up a little bit earlier
5JATGoxXX4o,183680,185040,yeah you don't have to make it be crazy
5JATGoxXX4o,185040,186879,loud but at least spin up if it's
5JATGoxXX4o,186879,189360,hitting 100 degrees now one thing i
5JATGoxXX4o,189360,191519,really wish this thing had was fast
5JATGoxXX4o,191519,193680,charging we've been testing these things
5JATGoxXX4o,193680,196560,running down the batteries and it takes
5JATGoxXX4o,196560,199760,forever to charge it up closer to three
5JATGoxXX4o,199760,202400,hours whereas the rest of the lineup now
5JATGoxXX4o,202400,204319,as far as charging 50
5JATGoxXX4o,204319,207840,in just 30 minutes and so that when you
5JATGoxXX4o,207840,209440,do have to charge that is an
5JATGoxXX4o,209440,211200,inconvenience but flipping over to the
5JATGoxXX4o,211200,213040,battery life it is
5JATGoxXX4o,213040,216000,incredible for light uses
5JATGoxXX4o,216000,217840,better than the m1 macbook pro which is
5JATGoxXX4o,217840,219680,already amazing now dave lee actually
5JATGoxXX4o,219680,221760,did some very in-depth testing he has
5JATGoxXX4o,221760,223280,this chart so i'm not going to make my
5JATGoxXX4o,223280,226080,own i'll show you his thank you dave and
5JATGoxXX4o,226080,229360,this thing for light uses is shockingly
5JATGoxXX4o,229360,231920,good and it works really good because it
5JATGoxXX4o,231920,234159,has the larger more powerful efficiency
5JATGoxXX4o,234159,236000,cores that apple updated so it doesn't
5JATGoxXX4o,236000,237840,have to use the performance cores as
5JATGoxXX4o,237840,240560,much but on the flip side if you are
5JATGoxXX4o,240560,242400,going to start pushing it that is when
5JATGoxXX4o,242400,244159,the battery life does get worse than it
5JATGoxXX4o,244159,246159,was before because it is using roughly
5JATGoxXX4o,246159,249360,33 percent more power in order to gain
5JATGoxXX4o,249360,253200,about 13 more performance on the cpu and
5JATGoxXX4o,253200,255120,then the graphics also uses more power
5JATGoxXX4o,255120,257120,as well and of course we already
5JATGoxXX4o,257120,259359,mentioned ssds in multiple videos we
5JATGoxXX4o,259359,261519,made a video specifically about that
5JATGoxXX4o,261519,262800,performance
5JATGoxXX4o,262800,266320,and this is just something that is very
5JATGoxXX4o,266320,268720,sad that this is happening now i know
5JATGoxXX4o,268720,270160,apple needs to make money maybe there's
5JATGoxXX4o,270160,271840,not enough chip supply and so they're
5JATGoxXX4o,271840,273280,trying to do a single chip instead of
5JATGoxXX4o,273280,275520,two but it's just weird having a product
5JATGoxXX4o,275520,278080,that came out a year and a half later
5JATGoxXX4o,278080,279840,that is an expensive product with the
5JATGoxXX4o,279840,282320,pro name on it but the ssd is half the
5JATGoxXX4o,282320,284880,speed compared to before now we already
5JATGoxXX4o,284880,286800,mentioned that what i didn't mention is
5JATGoxXX4o,286800,289759,slc caching now when you're transferring
5JATGoxXX4o,289759,292720,a large file most of these ssds
5JATGoxXX4o,292720,294639,they will actually slow down after a
5JATGoxXX4o,294639,296720,certain amount is written and what i
5JATGoxXX4o,296720,298880,found is that with the
5JATGoxXX4o,298880,302080,256 gig model on the m2 it actually
5JATGoxXX4o,302080,305680,slows down earlier so about 40 45 gigs
5JATGoxXX4o,305680,308880,and then it slows down from about 1 300
5JATGoxXX4o,308880,310479,megabytes per second
5JATGoxXX4o,310479,312479,all the way down to about an average of
5JATGoxXX4o,312479,316479,200 250 now the m1 also the base model
5JATGoxXX4o,316479,320240,256 gig it will actually record right at
5JATGoxXX4o,320240,324160,uh 1900 from my external ssd and it also
5JATGoxXX4o,324160,326000,does slow down takes a little bit longer
5JATGoxXX4o,326000,327440,but then when it slows down it's still
5JATGoxXX4o,327440,331039,riding over 400 so i actually
5JATGoxXX4o,331039,333680,transferred a big file which is our test
5JATGoxXX4o,333680,334880,folder with a bunch of different
5JATGoxXX4o,334880,338080,benchmarks the m2 took 5 minutes and 34
5JATGoxXX4o,338080,341280,seconds while the m1 took 2 minutes and
5JATGoxXX4o,341280,344639,55 seconds and keep in mind it actually
5JATGoxXX4o,344639,347120,would have been quite a bit faster if we
5JATGoxXX4o,347120,349680,had a faster external ssd this one is
5JATGoxXX4o,349680,351440,just our favorite because it's universal
5JATGoxXX4o,351440,353039,it's a great price
5JATGoxXX4o,353039,355600,so that is unfortunate because not only
5JATGoxXX4o,355600,358479,will it slow down even more with the soc
5JATGoxXX4o,358479,361360,cash but also if you guys didn't see our
5JATGoxXX4o,361360,364319,ssd test video with real world tests
5JATGoxXX4o,364319,365520,when you're opening up professional
5JATGoxXX4o,365520,368000,applications a bunch of tabs it is less
5JATGoxXX4o,368000,370560,responsive than the macbook and i wanted
5JATGoxXX4o,370560,372319,to do that test just to see
5JATGoxXX4o,372319,373360,um
5JATGoxXX4o,373360,375520,was i right was this actually less
5JATGoxXX4o,375520,377919,snappy and in fact it is and
5JATGoxXX4o,377919,381280,professional uses also slow down if
5JATGoxXX4o,381280,383520,you're loading up the same amount of
5JATGoxXX4o,383520,386400,tabs and applications on the m1 versus
5JATGoxXX4o,386400,389600,m2 the m2 gets slower which is insane
5JATGoxXX4o,389600,392479,and that just brings me to you know my
5JATGoxXX4o,392479,394319,kind of thoughts on this machine it
5JATGoxXX4o,394319,397919,should not be called pro in 2022
5JATGoxXX4o,397919,400240,now if this came out at the time that m1
5JATGoxXX4o,400240,401919,did it still have been a great update
5JATGoxXX4o,401919,403600,compared to the intel model but we're
5JATGoxXX4o,403600,406800,taking one step back the ssds can't keep
5JATGoxXX4o,406800,408639,up with most of these thunderbolt drives
5JATGoxXX4o,408639,410880,now the whole system slows down if you
5JATGoxXX4o,410880,413280,open up multiple applications
5JATGoxXX4o,413280,416240,so if you do want to have a laptop for
5JATGoxXX4o,416240,417759,light simple tasks you're going to get
5JATGoxXX4o,417759,419680,insane battery life
5JATGoxXX4o,419680,421280,it's going to work well
5JATGoxXX4o,421280,424639,but that means it's not a pro machine so
5JATGoxXX4o,424639,426720,that is just the weird thing about it
5JATGoxXX4o,426720,428479,now we're gonna do some more testing
5JATGoxXX4o,428479,430639,we're gonna look at video editing um
5JATGoxXX4o,430639,432319,some more in-depth stuff so make sure
5JATGoxXX4o,432319,433840,you guys are gonna watch that if you
5JATGoxXX4o,433840,435759,guys want more info
5JATGoxXX4o,435759,437759,but for your guys's questions people are
5JATGoxXX4o,437759,440479,asking should i jump to the 16 gig model
5JATGoxXX4o,440479,442639,or 512 because we're now not
5JATGoxXX4o,442639,444560,recommending the base model because the
5JATGoxXX4o,444560,446639,ssds are slow and the whole system slows
5JATGoxXX4o,446639,447440,down
5JATGoxXX4o,447440,450240,well it depends on how much uh space you
5JATGoxXX4o,450240,452479,need for example if you don't use more
5JATGoxXX4o,452479,456000,than 256 gig like i do jump up to 16 gig
5JATGoxXX4o,456000,458160,if you want to have more space well then
5JATGoxXX4o,458160,460319,that speed is gonna kick back up to the
5JATGoxXX4o,460319,462720,level of the m1 at the base even though
5JATGoxXX4o,462720,464639,you have to spend 200 bucks more and
5JATGoxXX4o,464639,466479,that makes it a much more responsive
5JATGoxXX4o,466479,469520,system when you're using it so i would
5JATGoxXX4o,469520,471280,uh i would end up
5JATGoxXX4o,471280,472720,getting more storage if you feel like
5JATGoxXX4o,472720,475360,you might need it but if not kick up the
5JATGoxXX4o,475360,477440,ram and then the hard thing is if you
5JATGoxXX4o,477440,480240,kick both up well at that point you're
5JATGoxXX4o,480240,482000,not far off from the 14 inch which is
5JATGoxXX4o,482000,483759,our next comparison and you can buy one
5JATGoxXX4o,483759,486879,of those for 200 bucks off right now on
5JATGoxXX4o,486879,489840,amazon so 100 bucks more than the m2
5JATGoxXX4o,489840,491840,that is crazy i will link that down
5JATGoxXX4o,491840,494240,below now about the m2 macbook air
5JATGoxXX4o,494240,496080,they're asking will the m2 macbook air
5JATGoxXX4o,496080,497199,ssds
5JATGoxXX4o,497199,499919,we will see i sure hope not but i think
5JATGoxXX4o,499919,502000,if apple is doing this to their pro
5JATGoxXX4o,502000,504400,machine i would expect the m2 macbook
5JATGoxXX4o,504400,506800,air to also get slower
5JATGoxXX4o,506800,509120,compared to the previous generation and
5JATGoxXX4o,509120,510400,the last question we're getting is
5JATGoxXX4o,510400,513599,should you just buy an m1 refurbished or
5JATGoxXX4o,513599,516000,used or a discount compared to getting
5JATGoxXX4o,516000,518640,the m2 model well if you're getting a
5JATGoxXX4o,518640,521279,good price on it i think yes especially
5JATGoxXX4o,521279,523120,if you want to get the base model
5JATGoxXX4o,523120,524240,because
5JATGoxXX4o,524240,526240,you are going to have a snappy system
5JATGoxXX4o,526240,527839,when you open up a bunch of tabs or
5JATGoxXX4o,527839,529200,programs it's still going to stay
5JATGoxXX4o,529200,531279,quicker than if you would have had an m2
5JATGoxXX4o,531279,533279,at that base configuration
5JATGoxXX4o,533279,536160,and even though the cpu is faster on the
5JATGoxXX4o,536160,538399,m2 it's not a huge difference you're
5JATGoxXX4o,538399,540560,still going to be very happy with the m1
5JATGoxXX4o,540560,542399,and then if you don't use the graphics
5JATGoxXX4o,542399,543920,you're not constantly pushing it that
5JATGoxXX4o,543920,545360,part will matter to you at all so if
5JATGoxXX4o,545360,546880,you're getting a nice discount and of
5JATGoxXX4o,546880,548640,course amazon has great deals they're
5JATGoxXX4o,548640,550800,clearing these out now i think you'll be
5JATGoxXX4o,550800,552880,happy with it or the m1 macbook air
5JATGoxXX4o,552880,555680,which was our favorite laptop or until
5JATGoxXX4o,555680,558320,the m21 comes out so there you guys go
5JATGoxXX4o,558320,559920,if you have any other questions you want
5JATGoxXX4o,559920,561839,us to cover in our full review after
5JATGoxXX4o,561839,563760,we've done more testing go ahead and ask
