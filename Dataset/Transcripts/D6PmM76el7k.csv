D6PmM76el7k,240,3120,ah would you look at that nearly four
D6PmM76el7k,3120,5120,months without a single fnaf episode
D6PmM76el7k,5120,6720,feels like it's a brand new day for the
D6PmM76el7k,6720,8400,channel there have been so many new
D6PmM76el7k,8400,10400,games new meta theories even some
D6PmM76el7k,10400,13679,classic science episodes thrown in ah
D6PmM76el7k,13679,17840,i'm happy i'm healthy life is good and
D6PmM76el7k,17840,21520,now time to relax
D6PmM76el7k,26240,29519,hello internet welcome to game theory
D6PmM76el7k,29519,31519,the show where old habits and old
D6PmM76el7k,31519,33840,animatronics die hard today we're
D6PmM76el7k,33840,35760,talking about the 12th and final
D6PmM76el7k,35760,37760,installment of the fazbear frights book
D6PmM76el7k,37760,40000,series felix the shark that's right
D6PmM76el7k,40000,44079,friends the final book
D6PmM76el7k,44079,47600,the next three come out later this year
D6PmM76el7k,48239,50079,anyway let's not think about that and
D6PmM76el7k,50079,52320,instead focus on felix now this final
D6PmM76el7k,52320,54320,book is special just like all the others
D6PmM76el7k,54320,56000,it too is a collection of three short
D6PmM76el7k,56000,57920,spooky stories vaguely connected to the
D6PmM76el7k,57920,60079,wider fnaf lore but where this one is
D6PmM76el7k,60079,61280,different is that it's meant to be a
D6PmM76el7k,61280,63760,collection of cut stories as the
D6PmM76el7k,63760,65760,official description reads quote stories
D6PmM76el7k,65760,67520,that didn't make the cut for the first
D6PmM76el7k,67520,70000,11 books which okay they didn't appear
D6PmM76el7k,70000,72320,in numbers 1 through 11 but still they
D6PmM76el7k,72320,74080,wound up getting published anyway as the
D6PmM76el7k,74080,76799,12th one is that such a big deal in fact
D6PmM76el7k,76799,78000,because they're last they're probably in
D6PmM76el7k,78000,80000,the most important position of any of
D6PmM76el7k,80000,82000,the stories and well you might assume
D6PmM76el7k,82000,83360,that they were cut because they were
D6PmM76el7k,83360,85600,weaker or lesser than the 33 other
D6PmM76el7k,85600,87119,fazbear frights that were produced it's
D6PmM76el7k,87119,89040,not really true you cut the story about
D6PmM76el7k,89040,90720,an animatronic shark but you kept the
D6PmM76el7k,90720,92720,one where a boy turns into a traffic
D6PmM76el7k,92720,94640,sign you cut girl solves dead bodies
D6PmM76el7k,94640,96479,shoved into animatronic suit mystery but
D6PmM76el7k,96479,98640,kept tiny guppy bodies you cut a
D6PmM76el7k,98640,100240,security guard named mike going around
D6PmM76el7k,100240,102399,collecting haunted fnaf memorabilia and
D6PmM76el7k,102399,105040,yet kept fazgoo the truth is we don't
D6PmM76el7k,105040,106640,really know why these were cut it could
D6PmM76el7k,106640,108079,have been a quality thing it could have
D6PmM76el7k,108079,109840,been that they confused the lore or
D6PmM76el7k,109840,112240,maybe just maybe it could have been that
D6PmM76el7k,112240,113759,they were intentionally designed to set
D6PmM76el7k,113759,115520,up secret puzzles that we were meant to
D6PmM76el7k,115520,118000,solve and those puzzles never got fully
D6PmM76el7k,118000,120479,realized spoiler alert i think it might
D6PmM76el7k,120479,122399,have been that last one i believe that
D6PmM76el7k,122399,124159,scott was planning to use this final
D6PmM76el7k,124159,126320,book as a launching point the start of a
D6PmM76el7k,126320,128000,real world treasure hunt that would have
D6PmM76el7k,128000,130160,required using the books the games even
D6PmM76el7k,130160,132400,stuff like the coloring book in order to
D6PmM76el7k,132400,134319,crack i suspect that this was a riddle
D6PmM76el7k,134319,136640,so far reaching and so complex it would
D6PmM76el7k,136640,138319,have required the cooperation of fnaf
D6PmM76el7k,138319,140480,theorists from across the globe today
D6PmM76el7k,140480,142319,i'm gonna explain the clues that led me
D6PmM76el7k,142319,144239,to this conclusion but more importantly
D6PmM76el7k,144239,146239,i'm gonna ask you for your help you see
D6PmM76el7k,146239,148000,while i'm reasonably confident this
D6PmM76el7k,148000,149920,thing was never finished i'm not sure i
D6PmM76el7k,149920,152000,can't be sure unless you all double
D6PmM76el7k,152000,154160,check for me a few years ago i asked for
D6PmM76el7k,154160,155840,all your help in solving the security
D6PmM76el7k,155840,157680,logbook and a day later we discovered
D6PmM76el7k,157680,159760,the name of cassidy today i'm gonna ask
D6PmM76el7k,159760,161519,you for something similar i'm gonna take
D6PmM76el7k,161519,163200,you on a journey through some weird
D6PmM76el7k,163200,165120,corners of fnaf lore and some loose
D6PmM76el7k,165120,166640,threads that i see in this new book and
D6PmM76el7k,166640,168319,then i'm gonna ask you for the favor i
D6PmM76el7k,168319,170239,need you to help me either solve this
D6PmM76el7k,170239,172560,thing once and for all or debunk it and
D6PmM76el7k,172560,174400,who knows maybe this is the push that we
D6PmM76el7k,174400,176400,need to get the next major answer to the
D6PmM76el7k,176400,178319,game's lore but before you help me with

D6PmM76el7k,337680,339280,let's start by breaking down the stories
D6PmM76el7k,339280,341120,in felix the shark shall we the final
D6PmM76el7k,341120,343039,story you're the band is probably the
D6PmM76el7k,343039,345360,most obviously related to existing fnaf
D6PmM76el7k,345360,347199,lore in it a small boy named timmy
D6PmM76el7k,347199,348639,becomes obsessed with everyone's
D6PmM76el7k,348639,350560,favorite pizza murder franchise freddy
D6PmM76el7k,350560,352639,fazbear's his mother finds him a strange
D6PmM76el7k,352639,354240,freddy mask on the internet and gives it
D6PmM76el7k,354240,356000,to him for his birthday after putting it
D6PmM76el7k,356000,358479,on timmy starts to change he doesn't
D6PmM76el7k,358479,360080,like the things he used to he becomes
D6PmM76el7k,360080,362080,moody and aggressive he even yells about
D6PmM76el7k,362080,363840,protecting the others when granddad
D6PmM76el7k,363840,364960,walks towards him with a knife
D6PmM76el7k,364960,366800,eventually timmy is led to an abandoned
D6PmM76el7k,366800,368800,freddy fazbear's building by a shadowy
D6PmM76el7k,368800,370479,figure the whole thing gives off some
D6PmM76el7k,370479,372960,very solid midnight motorist vibes in
D6PmM76el7k,372960,374639,order to rescue him his mother teams up
D6PmM76el7k,374639,376479,with a former freddy's security guard
D6PmM76el7k,376479,378000,named mike
D6PmM76el7k,378000,379520,turns out the freddie mask was possessed
D6PmM76el7k,379520,381120,by one of the children from the original
D6PmM76el7k,381120,382800,fazbear murders when timmy put on the
D6PmM76el7k,382800,384560,mask the spirit transferred into his
D6PmM76el7k,384560,386400,body which allowed it to control him
D6PmM76el7k,386400,387759,when mike and timmy's mom arrive at the
D6PmM76el7k,387759,389680,restaurant timmy is on stage in freddy's
D6PmM76el7k,389680,391600,position performing alongside bonnie and
D6PmM76el7k,391600,392880,chica after getting attacked by the
D6PmM76el7k,392880,394479,puppet mike manages to get the freddy
D6PmM76el7k,394479,396400,mask back onto timmy which captures the
D6PmM76el7k,396400,398080,spirit he then puts the mask back onto
D6PmM76el7k,398080,399440,the original freddy head getting the
D6PmM76el7k,399440,401440,spirit back to where it belongs now
D6PmM76el7k,401440,403680,gotta admit i got really excited when i
D6PmM76el7k,403680,405440,read the story we've suspected for a
D6PmM76el7k,405440,407199,while that fnaf1 security guard mike
D6PmM76el7k,407199,409120,schmidt was really michael afton going
D6PmM76el7k,409120,410960,from location to location to undo the
D6PmM76el7k,410960,412960,evils of his father william that's why
D6PmM76el7k,412960,414720,we play as mike through pretty much
D6PmM76el7k,414720,416160,every installment of the series up
D6PmM76el7k,416160,417520,through ultimate custom night it's why
D6PmM76el7k,417520,419360,mike's name appears in sister location
D6PmM76el7k,419360,422000,why fazbear frights burns down in fnf 3
D6PmM76el7k,422000,423759,and why the security guard in fnaf 2 is
D6PmM76el7k,423759,425520,fired for tampering with animatronics
D6PmM76el7k,425520,428000,and odor just like mike was in fnaf 1.
D6PmM76el7k,428000,429599,up until now that theory's never been
D6PmM76el7k,429599,431520,confirmed but this story seems to be
D6PmM76el7k,431520,433759,strong evidence for exactly that idea a
D6PmM76el7k,433759,435759,security guard named mike going around
D6PmM76el7k,435759,437599,collecting the old artifacts from freddy
D6PmM76el7k,437599,439199,locations in order to help free the
D6PmM76el7k,439199,441360,spirits of those trapped within so that
D6PmM76el7k,441360,443120,was already pretty cool and totally made
D6PmM76el7k,443120,444800,reading this book worthwhile anytime we
D6PmM76el7k,444800,446080,can get more evidence to support a
D6PmM76el7k,446080,448160,theory within the franchise absolutely
D6PmM76el7k,448160,449919,worth it but while you're the band was
D6PmM76el7k,449919,452080,explicitly lore heavy the other two
D6PmM76el7k,452080,454240,stories were equally fascinating but for
D6PmM76el7k,454240,456080,different reasons there were details
D6PmM76el7k,456080,458240,that felt odd or out of place and
D6PmM76el7k,458240,459840,comments from characters that seemed
D6PmM76el7k,459840,461759,oddly specific in a way that just
D6PmM76el7k,461759,463680,triggered my lore hunting senses in the
D6PmM76el7k,463680,465520,title story felix the shark we follow a
D6PmM76el7k,465520,467199,young man named dirk who's reminiscing
D6PmM76el7k,467199,468400,with his friends about their shared
D6PmM76el7k,468400,470720,experiences with freddy fazbears however
D6PmM76el7k,470720,472960,dirk's memory is slightly different to
D6PmM76el7k,472960,474960,everyone else's he's convinced that
D6PmM76el7k,474960,477360,there was an extra animatronic a shark
D6PmM76el7k,477360,479280,named felix when his friends make fun of
D6PmM76el7k,479280,480960,him dirk sets off on a cross-country
D6PmM76el7k,480960,483199,quest to prove that he's not crazy it
D6PmM76el7k,483199,485039,takes him six restaurants but dirk
D6PmM76el7k,485039,487280,eventually does learn the truth it turns
D6PmM76el7k,487280,489280,out felix was made by the owner of one
D6PmM76el7k,489280,491440,very specific freddy fazbear's after his
D6PmM76el7k,491440,493599,son tragically drowned why would that
D6PmM76el7k,493599,495120,lead him to a shark animatronic because
D6PmM76el7k,495120,496639,it was a shark that actually pushed the
D6PmM76el7k,496639,498240,body back to shore couldn't make this
D6PmM76el7k,498240,500319,stuff up if i tried eventually dirk does
D6PmM76el7k,500319,502319,manage to locate felix the whole fnaf
D6PmM76el7k,502319,504720,pizzeria is hidden inside an abandoned
D6PmM76el7k,504720,506560,water park but the weird part isn't the
D6PmM76el7k,506560,508879,where but rather the how of finding
D6PmM76el7k,508879,510720,felix you see dirk is only able to find
D6PmM76el7k,510720,512640,the pizzeria using a series of clues
D6PmM76el7k,512640,515039,that are found in a random novel written
D6PmM76el7k,515039,517200,by the creator's daughter in universe
D6PmM76el7k,517200,519200,felix's creator also had a daughter who
D6PmM76el7k,519200,521039,grew up to become a popular author and
D6PmM76el7k,521039,522560,in one of her books the dog and
D6PmM76el7k,522560,524880,dogmatist she hides a series of clues in
D6PmM76el7k,524880,526880,plain sight within the book's dialogue
D6PmM76el7k,526880,528560,these glues ultimately prove meaningless
D6PmM76el7k,528560,529839,to the characters in the book because
D6PmM76el7k,529839,531519,they weren't meant for the characters
D6PmM76el7k,531519,533120,they were instead meant for the readers
D6PmM76el7k,533120,535120,to give them information they needed to
D6PmM76el7k,535120,538480,find felix it is very weird anyway dirk
D6PmM76el7k,538480,540240,figures all of this out and confronts
D6PmM76el7k,540240,542080,the author she gives him her butterfly
D6PmM76el7k,542080,544160,necklace and he uses all of this indiana
D6PmM76el7k,544160,546240,jones style to unlock a secret key
D6PmM76el7k,546240,548240,hidden in the bottom of an empty pool at
D6PmM76el7k,548240,550480,the water park the key unlocks the path
D6PmM76el7k,550480,551920,to the secret freddies where dirk
D6PmM76el7k,551920,553920,finally finds felix and then dirk dies
D6PmM76el7k,553920,555279,by climbing into the tank with felix
D6PmM76el7k,555279,556399,because these characters always have to
D6PmM76el7k,556399,558560,dine the stories it's dumb but you know
D6PmM76el7k,558560,560560,so be it anyway you see what's so weird
D6PmM76el7k,560560,562480,about all this right out of nowhere this
D6PmM76el7k,562480,564080,story is talking about clues to a real
D6PmM76el7k,564080,566240,world location hidden inside of another
D6PmM76el7k,566240,567760,book clues that are meaningless to the
D6PmM76el7k,567760,569920,characters but meaningful to the readers
D6PmM76el7k,569920,571760,not only did this stand out to me as a
D6PmM76el7k,571760,573920,suspiciously meta moment but it also got
D6PmM76el7k,573920,575360,me to immediately think about the
D6PmM76el7k,575360,577279,previous fazbear freight's installment
D6PmM76el7k,577279,579279,prankster you see in preparation for the
D6PmM76el7k,579279,580800,release of felix the shark i wanted to
D6PmM76el7k,580800,582399,refresh myself on all the previous
D6PmM76el7k,582399,584560,stories there are 33 of these things
D6PmM76el7k,584560,586399,after all it's a lot to keep track of so
D6PmM76el7k,586399,588399,i turned to another book the recently
D6PmM76el7k,588399,590480,released ultimate guidebook which if you
D6PmM76el7k,590480,592480,don't know has summaries of literally
D6PmM76el7k,592480,594000,everything that's ever happened in the
D6PmM76el7k,594000,596000,freddy fazbear universe from the games
D6PmM76el7k,596000,597680,to the books to the fan theories
D6PmM76el7k,597680,598880,basically if you're trying to catch up
D6PmM76el7k,598880,600720,with the series quickly it's definitely
D6PmM76el7k,600720,602720,worth a read and since this is the third
D6PmM76el7k,602720,604560,and final addition to the book one
D6PmM76el7k,604560,606560,written by scott coffin you know that
D6PmM76el7k,606560,608399,whatever is deemed most relevant for the
D6PmM76el7k,608399,609920,lore is going to be called out within
D6PmM76el7k,609920,612079,its pages anyway each fazbear freight
D6PmM76el7k,612079,613920,story has its own little summary page
D6PmM76el7k,613920,615680,providing a general plot overview as
D6PmM76el7k,615680,617040,well as a list of connections between
D6PmM76el7k,617040,619279,the story and the games not everything
D6PmM76el7k,619279,621040,here is useful but it definitely gets
D6PmM76el7k,621040,622640,you into the mindset of the authors and
D6PmM76el7k,622640,624079,it helps you see some of the connections
D6PmM76el7k,624079,625519,that the stories were trying to make
D6PmM76el7k,625519,626880,again if it doesn't make the cut to
D6PmM76el7k,626880,628240,appear in this book you're likely
D6PmM76el7k,628240,630399,barking down the wrong path likewise if
D6PmM76el7k,630399,631920,something is called out within these
D6PmM76el7k,631920,633680,pages it's at least worth considering
D6PmM76el7k,633680,635920,when theory crafting tldr as i was
D6PmM76el7k,635920,637360,getting close to the end of my refresher
D6PmM76el7k,637360,639360,course i noticed this in the new lead
D6PmM76el7k,639360,641360,section for the title story of book 11
D6PmM76el7k,641360,643600,prankster quote some of the puzzle clues
D6PmM76el7k,643600,645760,such as stinger moot and even more
D6PmM76el7k,645760,647680,frights have implications beyond the
D6PmM76el7k,647680,649519,plot careful readers may want to give
D6PmM76el7k,649519,652320,these scenes a second look implications
D6PmM76el7k,652320,654160,beyond the plot you say just like with
D6PmM76el7k,654160,655680,felix the shark it appears that the
D6PmM76el7k,655680,657839,ultimate guide is also pointing us to
D6PmM76el7k,657839,660320,meta clues within a different book clues
D6PmM76el7k,660320,662320,that are meant for us the readers rather
D6PmM76el7k,662320,664399,than for the characters in the story so
D6PmM76el7k,664399,666160,i went back to prankster in this story
D6PmM76el7k,666160,667839,the main character jeremiah is trying to
D6PmM76el7k,667839,669440,save his friends from a mysterious
D6PmM76el7k,669440,671200,glitchy voice that's freed itself from a
D6PmM76el7k,671200,673040,fnaf vr game that's being worked on at
D6PmM76el7k,673040,675600,the company sounds pretty darn familiar
D6PmM76el7k,675600,677120,along the way he's presented with a
D6PmM76el7k,677120,679279,series of riddles stinger moot which is
D6PmM76el7k,679279,681200,an anagram of testing room give me one
D6PmM76el7k,681200,683120,and i'll make more each one like the one
D6PmM76el7k,683120,685440,before what am i your next clue contains
D6PmM76el7k,685440,687440,even more frights to get there you just
D6PmM76el7k,687440,689360,need to follow the lights i see you're
D6PmM76el7k,689360,690959,moving closer to your goal follow the
D6PmM76el7k,690959,692560,lights to make things right and for the
D6PmM76el7k,692560,694720,key to find where your friends hide roll
D6PmM76el7k,694720,697040,up your sleeves and reach inside now
D6PmM76el7k,697040,698399,i've gone back and forth over these
D6PmM76el7k,698399,700000,clues multiple times but it felt like a
D6PmM76el7k,700000,701360,lot of them were just pointing back to
D6PmM76el7k,701360,702720,stuff that we'd already discussed in
D6PmM76el7k,702720,704560,previous theories the give me one and
D6PmM76el7k,704560,706240,i'll make more felt like a reference to
D6PmM76el7k,706240,708560,the glitch trap cult using fnaf vr's
D6PmM76el7k,708560,710480,tapes to infect more playtesters the
D6PmM76el7k,710480,712480,following the light's clues maybe could
D6PmM76el7k,712480,714079,be a reference to princess quest where
D6PmM76el7k,714079,715680,we have to light the lanterns to reveal
D6PmM76el7k,715680,717200,the truth and eventually set vanessa
D6PmM76el7k,717200,718480,free but none of this was new
D6PmM76el7k,718480,720160,information we've talked about all of
D6PmM76el7k,720160,722000,this stuff in depth security breach
D6PmM76el7k,722000,723519,seemed to confirm some of this stuff and
D6PmM76el7k,723519,725120,be honest the connections i could make
D6PmM76el7k,725120,727440,were speculative at best i tried
D6PmM76el7k,727440,729200,rearranging the letters and the anagrams
D6PmM76el7k,729200,730800,didn't really get anything interesting i
D6PmM76el7k,730800,732480,even considered that maybe the stinger
D6PmM76el7k,732480,734959,moot and even more frights clues were
D6PmM76el7k,734959,736560,literal the stingers of the fazbear
D6PmM76el7k,736560,738160,frights books were the epilogues about
D6PmM76el7k,738160,739920,the stitch raids so maybe if the stinger
D6PmM76el7k,739920,741839,is moot then the stitch raid stuff is
D6PmM76el7k,741839,743680,ultimately meaningless even more frights
D6PmM76el7k,743680,745360,might refer to the next set of books
D6PmM76el7k,745360,747360,tales of the pizzaplex i mean sure
D6PmM76el7k,747360,749360,that's a valid explanation but it was
D6PmM76el7k,749360,751760,speculation at best and also pretty darn
D6PmM76el7k,751760,753279,lame why would you go to all the trouble
D6PmM76el7k,753279,755040,of hiding meta clues like this about
D6PmM76el7k,755040,756880,stuff that feels ultimately
D6PmM76el7k,756880,758320,underwhelming these aren't really
D6PmM76el7k,758320,759839,questions that people were asking
D6PmM76el7k,759839,761360,themselves you know so at least
D6PmM76el7k,761360,762880,according to the ultimate guide there's
D6PmM76el7k,762880,764480,definitely something hidden inside of
D6PmM76el7k,764480,766800,that prankster story and i'm not exactly
D6PmM76el7k,766800,768800,sure what it is but there was even more
D6PmM76el7k,768800,771040,that was suspicious with felix the shark
D6PmM76el7k,771040,772560,you see dirk doesn't just find the
D6PmM76el7k,772560,774160,secret freddy's thanks to written clues
D6PmM76el7k,774160,775920,inside of a random book there's also a
D6PmM76el7k,775920,778160,very specific drawing in the middle of
D6PmM76el7k,778160,779519,that book here's the full quote when
D6PmM76el7k,779519,781440,describing the dog and dogmatist the
D6PmM76el7k,781440,782880,book where the hidden clues are from
D6PmM76el7k,782880,784399,quote the man's search for the creature
D6PmM76el7k,784399,786480,was convoluted on the whole but certain
D6PmM76el7k,786480,788720,lines in the book went beyond convoluted
D6PmM76el7k,788720,790320,they just didn't make sense neither did
D6PmM76el7k,790320,792000,the drawing in the middle of the book an
D6PmM76el7k,792000,794079,ornate and frilly sketch of what looked
D6PmM76el7k,794079,796320,like butterflies and flowers the drawing
D6PmM76el7k,796320,798240,was never referred to in the book and it
D6PmM76el7k,798240,799920,couldn't be related to any of the story
D6PmM76el7k,799920,801519,were the odd lines and drawing some kind
D6PmM76el7k,801519,803600,of code for what purpose and that's not
D6PmM76el7k,803600,805600,the only time drawings are brought up in
D6PmM76el7k,805600,807920,this one story there was yet another odd
D6PmM76el7k,807920,809680,reference in felix the shark that jumped
D6PmM76el7k,809680,811440,out to me quote again i'd forgotten all
D6PmM76el7k,811440,813519,about freddy's but yeah now i remember i
D6PmM76el7k,813519,815760,loved the freddy's coloring books that's
D6PmM76el7k,815760,817680,what started my drawing eventually i got
D6PmM76el7k,817680,819120,tired of coloring and just drew the
D6PmM76el7k,819120,821519,figures last year the official fnaf
D6PmM76el7k,821519,823120,coloring book released which for a
D6PmM76el7k,823120,825120,normal franchise would be a big old who
D6PmM76el7k,825120,827199,cares moment but here where the biggest
D6PmM76el7k,827199,829279,character reveals happened in a spin-off
D6PmM76el7k,829279,831360,children's activity book yeah i wouldn't
D6PmM76el7k,831360,833600,put anything past this franchise so it
D6PmM76el7k,833600,835839,felt strange to mention a real world
D6PmM76el7k,835839,838399,item for it only to mean nothing so of
D6PmM76el7k,838399,840560,course i bought myself the coloring book
D6PmM76el7k,840560,842720,and the official how to draw book i went
D6PmM76el7k,842720,844560,through the pages over and over and over
D6PmM76el7k,844560,846399,again but the only thing i was drawing
D6PmM76el7k,846399,848160,was a blank seriously though i couldn't
D6PmM76el7k,848160,850079,find anything loads of cool pieces of
D6PmM76el7k,850079,852000,artwork like this twisted chica that's
D6PmM76el7k,852000,854240,only ever mentioned by name but nothing
D6PmM76el7k,854240,855920,major i checked with black lights i
D6PmM76el7k,855920,857279,heated up a page or two to see if it
D6PmM76el7k,857279,859120,would reveal some invisible ink nothing
D6PmM76el7k,859120,860880,or at least nothing that i could find
D6PmM76el7k,860880,862320,and then it hit me what if this wasn't
D6PmM76el7k,862320,863839,about solving a mystery within the story
D6PmM76el7k,863839,865680,but instead something bigger something
D6PmM76el7k,865680,867519,more real the clues in dirk's book
D6PmM76el7k,867519,868959,didn't make any sense until you were in
D6PmM76el7k,868959,870720,the right place at the right time this
D6PmM76el7k,870720,873279,could all be hinting at an arg where
D6PmM76el7k,873279,875199,just like dirk if you find the location
D6PmM76el7k,875199,876800,suddenly the clues that people had been
D6PmM76el7k,876800,878720,theorizing about for months start to
D6PmM76el7k,878720,880880,fall into place which leads us to the
D6PmM76el7k,880880,883760,final story of felix the shark the scoop
D6PmM76el7k,883760,885839,in this story a young girl named mandy
D6PmM76el7k,885839,888160,is an online fnaf theorist no joke she
D6PmM76el7k,888160,889760,even signs off one of her posts by
D6PmM76el7k,889760,891680,saying and i quote i can't share all my
D6PmM76el7k,891680,894560,secret facts yet until i solve this game
D6PmM76el7k,894560,896639,theory anyway mandy digs through the
D6PmM76el7k,896639,899600,code of fnaf 3 literally fnaf 3 the game
D6PmM76el7k,899600,902000,it is mentioned explicitly only to
D6PmM76el7k,902000,903920,discover a hidden picture of a building
D6PmM76el7k,903920,905360,she tracks it down and she learns about
D6PmM76el7k,905360,907040,a real-life missing children's incident
D6PmM76el7k,907040,908480,after a few nightmares where the spirit
D6PmM76el7k,908480,910079,of the dead child appears she ends up
D6PmM76el7k,910079,911920,going to the location only to find an
D6PmM76el7k,911920,914240,old animatronic bear giving off a nasty
D6PmM76el7k,914240,916160,smell surprise surprise the kid was
D6PmM76el7k,916160,918639,inside of there the whole time mandy is
D6PmM76el7k,918639,920480,praised as a hero for finally finding
D6PmM76el7k,920480,922240,the missing child and she closes out her
D6PmM76el7k,922240,924160,blog by saying quote i will probably
D6PmM76el7k,924160,925440,never know for certain how this
D6PmM76el7k,925440,927040,mysterious building is connected to the
D6PmM76el7k,927040,928880,fnaf universe the only thing i am
D6PmM76el7k,928880,930959,certain of is if the creator wanted us
D6PmM76el7k,930959,934399,to know i think he would tell us wow
D6PmM76el7k,934399,936480,just wow feeling a bit attacked not
D6PmM76el7k,936480,938240,gonna lie though in my defense if we
D6PmM76el7k,938240,939680,waited for scott to tell us anything
D6PmM76el7k,939680,941199,we'd know next to nothing about this
D6PmM76el7k,941199,943360,franchise's lore just saying anyway
D6PmM76el7k,943360,944959,outside of the heavy references in this
D6PmM76el7k,944959,946800,story to theorists and the real world
D6PmM76el7k,946800,948959,game of fnaf 3 the weirdest thing about
D6PmM76el7k,948959,951120,this one is that it contains a lot of
D6PmM76el7k,951120,953040,specific details as to where the events
D6PmM76el7k,953040,955759,of the story take place 33 fazbear
D6PmM76el7k,955759,957839,frights in and no other story in the
D6PmM76el7k,957839,959759,franchise features this level of detail
D6PmM76el7k,959759,962480,the cities the street names file names
D6PmM76el7k,962480,964399,locations of buildings details that are
D6PmM76el7k,964399,966320,seemingly inconsequential to the greater
D6PmM76el7k,966320,968160,story and in pretty much every other
D6PmM76el7k,968160,970240,book would be skimmed over or kept vague
D6PmM76el7k,970240,971920,when mandy finds this mysterious image
D6PmM76el7k,971920,973680,in the game files she traces it back to
D6PmM76el7k,973680,976240,utah yes the actual us state this fact
D6PmM76el7k,976240,978160,is further solidified when mandy's mom
D6PmM76el7k,978160,979759,takes her on a business trip to cedar
D6PmM76el7k,979759,982320,city a real city in utah to complete the
D6PmM76el7k,982320,984240,investigation now this is where the
D6PmM76el7k,984240,985680,trail starts to go cold because what
D6PmM76el7k,985680,987920,mandy's looking for is an old cinema on
D6PmM76el7k,987920,990560,willowfield road in peace valley which
D6PmM76el7k,990560,992160,after a lot of google searches i can
D6PmM76el7k,992160,994560,tell you just doesn't exist at least not
D6PmM76el7k,994560,996880,in utah however in the story we do learn
D6PmM76el7k,996880,998800,that peace valley is only 15 minutes on
D6PmM76el7k,998800,1001040,highway from cedar city so i looked up
D6PmM76el7k,1001040,1002880,where he can drive to in 15 minutes from
D6PmM76el7k,1002880,1004560,the center of cedar city and it turns
D6PmM76el7k,1004560,1006399,out there is a very small town just to
D6PmM76el7k,1006399,1008800,the south called canaraville so i hopped
D6PmM76el7k,1008800,1010480,onto google street view to check out
D6PmM76el7k,1010480,1012079,other details that the book mentioned
D6PmM76el7k,1012079,1013600,like the old cinema which used to be a
D6PmM76el7k,1013600,1015680,pizzeria as well as having a post office
D6PmM76el7k,1015680,1017839,on the corner unfortunately neither of
D6PmM76el7k,1017839,1019279,these things seem to exist in
D6PmM76el7k,1019279,1021519,canaraville they do have a post office
D6PmM76el7k,1021519,1023600,and it's near a corner but it's more
D6PmM76el7k,1023600,1025520,like the middle of the street and so shy
D6PmM76el7k,1025520,1027120,of me buying a plane ticket to go to the
D6PmM76el7k,1027120,1029760,middle of nowhere utah myself my options
D6PmM76el7k,1029760,1032400,were once again drying up so okay but
D6PmM76el7k,1032400,1033918,what about the actual game the game
D6PmM76el7k,1033918,1035520,mandy is playing is specifically called
D6PmM76el7k,1035520,1037760,out to be fnaf 3. i wondered if scott
D6PmM76el7k,1037760,1039760,had maybe retroactively put a file into
D6PmM76el7k,1039760,1041120,the game that maybe everyone's missed so
D6PmM76el7k,1041120,1042558,i went over to steam and looked at the
D6PmM76el7k,1042558,1044000,update logs but the game hasn't been
D6PmM76el7k,1044000,1046319,updated since april of 2015 and i very
D6PmM76el7k,1046319,1047918,much doubt that scott's been playing a
D6PmM76el7k,1047918,1050000,seven year long con especially since
D6PmM76el7k,1050000,1051919,into the pit the first fazbear frights
D6PmM76el7k,1051919,1053440,book didn't hit store shelves until
D6PmM76el7k,1053440,1055679,december of 2019 but mandy wasn't just
D6PmM76el7k,1055679,1057440,playing for nav3 it's explicitly
D6PmM76el7k,1057440,1059440,mentioned that she's playing the fnaf 3
D6PmM76el7k,1059440,1061919,mobile port so i took a look at those
D6PmM76el7k,1061919,1064000,update logs same situation the game
D6PmM76el7k,1064000,1065760,hasn't been updated since february of
D6PmM76el7k,1065760,1067840,2020 now we don't know when this story
D6PmM76el7k,1067840,1069440,got cut in the two years of fazbear
D6PmM76el7k,1069440,1070960,frights run so it could have been in
D6PmM76el7k,1070960,1073120,existence then but i'll be honest i do
D6PmM76el7k,1073120,1074880,not have the elite hacksaw skills to
D6PmM76el7k,1074880,1076559,bust open a mobile game to look for the
D6PmM76el7k,1076559,1078720,files and so just like that i was out of
D6PmM76el7k,1078720,1081280,options out of clues out of ideas gotta
D6PmM76el7k,1081280,1083360,be honest i feel kinda defeated on this
D6PmM76el7k,1083360,1084960,one weeks of looking through these books
D6PmM76el7k,1084960,1086480,trying to find something that just
D6PmM76el7k,1086480,1088799,wasn't clicking and yet i couldn't shake
D6PmM76el7k,1088799,1090400,it the whole thing gave me some big
D6PmM76el7k,1090400,1092720,gravity falls energy vibes for those of
D6PmM76el7k,1092720,1094240,you who don't know one of my favorite tv
D6PmM76el7k,1094240,1096400,shows of all time gravity falls did this
D6PmM76el7k,1096400,1098640,massive globe spanning air g back in
D6PmM76el7k,1098640,1100720,2016. it was a series that was all about
D6PmM76el7k,1100720,1103280,hidden mysteries ciphers secret codes
D6PmM76el7k,1103280,1104960,complete with a book much like the
D6PmM76el7k,1104960,1106880,survival logbook that you could buy that
D6PmM76el7k,1106880,1108559,contained puzzles and secrets for the
D6PmM76el7k,1108559,1110880,fan community to solve and this arg
D6PmM76el7k,1110880,1112240,launched after the conclusion of the
D6PmM76el7k,1112240,1114320,show tasked fans of the series from all
D6PmM76el7k,1114320,1115840,corners of the map to work together in a
D6PmM76el7k,1115840,1117200,quest that would eventually lead them to
D6PmM76el7k,1117200,1118880,a statue of the show's villain bill
D6PmM76el7k,1118880,1120720,cipher hidden out in the middle of the
D6PmM76el7k,1120720,1123280,woods maybe fnaf was seeding out clues
D6PmM76el7k,1123280,1125039,for something similar or maybe there
D6PmM76el7k,1125039,1126640,were plans to do a similar sort of
D6PmM76el7k,1126640,1128400,treasure hunt but the plans got scrapped
D6PmM76el7k,1128400,1130799,along the way i can't be sure but there
D6PmM76el7k,1130799,1132559,were just too many weird details here
D6PmM76el7k,1132559,1134720,that didn't seem to be mere coincidences
D6PmM76el7k,1134720,1136720,regardless i'd been bested but that
D6PmM76el7k,1136720,1138559,didn't mean i was done the last time i
D6PmM76el7k,1138559,1140400,felt like this was when the survival log
D6PmM76el7k,1140400,1142320,book released but instead of giving up i
D6PmM76el7k,1142320,1144160,threw the clues that i'd noticed out to
D6PmM76el7k,1144160,1146160,you guys the theorist community to help
D6PmM76el7k,1146160,1148400,me solve it and he came through we found

D6PmM76el7k,1150400,1152720,been confirmed by scott himself so here
