2dbupGVu0As,80,2800,when you open up one of these oreos
2dbupGVu0As,2800,4960,they're so thin like i know that there
2dbupGVu0As,4960,7839,are oreo thins but like these guys it's
2dbupGVu0As,7839,9599,like i'm eating a chocolate wafer and
2dbupGVu0As,9599,12240,there's maybe a fraction of cream in
2dbupGVu0As,12240,13679,there and then i open up double stuff
2dbupGVu0As,13679,16240,and i'm like oh look at that thick layer
2dbupGVu0As,16240,18640,of cream in there i want that thickness
2dbupGVu0As,18640,21199,inside my
2dbupGVu0As,22080,23039,nope
2dbupGVu0As,23039,24480,don't say that
2dbupGVu0As,24480,26640,i should not have said that
2dbupGVu0As,26640,28800,that was a mistake mistakes were made
2dbupGVu0As,28800,33079,friends lots of mistakes were made
2dbupGVu0As,36450,42129,[Music]
2dbupGVu0As,44079,46640,hello internet welcome to food theory
2dbupGVu0As,46640,49360,where today is a delicious day because
2dbupGVu0As,49360,52079,we've got a lot of oreos set to test uh
2dbupGVu0As,52079,54239,you'll see around me we have oreos of
2dbupGVu0As,54239,56160,all different shapes and sizes we've got
2dbupGVu0As,56160,59199,everything from your oreo minis to your
2dbupGVu0As,59199,62239,thin boy oreos all the way
2dbupGVu0As,62239,65439,to your thick boy oreos and your thicker
2dbupGVu0As,65439,66960,boy oreos
2dbupGVu0As,66960,68880,all in an effort to see
2dbupGVu0As,68880,72320,is a double stuff oreo truly double the
2dbupGVu0As,72320,74960,stuff as your basic one to me there is
2dbupGVu0As,74960,76799,absolutely no way
2dbupGVu0As,76799,79600,that this is twice
2dbupGVu0As,79600,82080,this no way and so i'm determined to
2dbupGVu0As,82080,83759,prove it and then from there we're also
2dbupGVu0As,83759,85759,exploring different types of oreos how
2dbupGVu0As,85759,88080,do oreo minis factor in how do oreo
2dbupGVu0As,88080,90880,thins factor in what about golden oreos
2dbupGVu0As,90880,93119,these guys are kind of also rams of the
2dbupGVu0As,93119,95680,oreo family are they any different i
2dbupGVu0As,95680,97920,threw in some mints just because the
2dbupGVu0As,97920,99439,minty oreos
2dbupGVu0As,99439,100799,it's not so much whether i'm curious
2dbupGVu0As,100799,102000,about how much stuffing is inside i just
2dbupGVu0As,102000,103600,wanted an excuse to buy these because
2dbupGVu0As,103600,104799,when you're talking about alternative
2dbupGVu0As,104799,106320,oreo flavors these are the best and then
2dbupGVu0As,106320,107759,lastly of course we're getting to the
2dbupGVu0As,107759,110479,big boys the mega stuffs and the more
2dbupGVu0As,110479,112320,stuffs if we were to classify these are
2dbupGVu0As,112320,114880,these what triple stuff oreo quadruple
2dbupGVu0As,114880,117360,stuff oreo because it's not mega stuff
2dbupGVu0As,117360,119840,mega means million stuff and that's i
2dbupGVu0As,119840,121840,don't know it's false advertising and
2dbupGVu0As,121840,123200,i'm not the only person who's been
2dbupGVu0As,123200,124399,curious about this other people have
2dbupGVu0As,124399,126960,done this experiment to varying results
2dbupGVu0As,126960,129200,take it away vo matpat back in 2013
2dbupGVu0As,129200,130879,nabisco came under fire when dan
2dbupGVu0As,130879,132640,anderson a high school math teacher in
2dbupGVu0As,132640,134319,queensbury new york decided to bring
2dbupGVu0As,134319,136160,some oreos to school for a hands-on
2dbupGVu0As,136160,138000,class activity his class found that
2dbupGVu0As,138000,140400,oreo's double stuff cookies were not in
2dbupGVu0As,140400,141840,fact what they claimed according to
2dbupGVu0As,141840,143520,their measurements the so-called double
2dbupGVu0As,143520,147040,stuff cookies were more like oreos 1.86
2dbupGVu0As,147040,148720,stuff cookies he shared the results on
2dbupGVu0As,148720,150319,his blog and got picked up by the news
2dbupGVu0As,150319,152560,weeks after business insider did their
2dbupGVu0As,152560,154160,own video investigation and found that
2dbupGVu0As,154160,157040,double stuff oreos were closer to 1.91
2dbupGVu0As,157040,159440,stuff not quite as low as dan anderson's
2dbupGVu0As,159440,160879,high school math class measured but
2dbupGVu0As,160879,163440,still shy of truly being double the
2dbupGVu0As,163440,165680,stuff now that might seem like a small
2dbupGVu0As,165680,167200,thing to get all worked up over but
2dbupGVu0As,167200,168959,remember that we live in a world where
2dbupGVu0As,168959,170959,subway ended up paying half a million
2dbupGVu0As,170959,172480,dollars to settle a lawsuit over the
2dbupGVu0As,172480,174160,fact that their foot long sandwiches
2dbupGVu0As,174160,176640,were sometimes only 11 inches long which
2dbupGVu0As,176640,178640,is probably why nabisco made official
2dbupGVu0As,178640,180159,statements in the aftermath of both of
2dbupGVu0As,180159,181360,these stories asserting that their
2dbupGVu0As,181360,183360,double stuffed oreos were exactly what
2dbupGVu0As,183360,185200,they claimed to be so that is what we're
2dbupGVu0As,185200,186720,here today to do to look at whether the
2dbupGVu0As,186720,188640,double stuff oreo truly has double the
2dbupGVu0As,188640,191040,stuffing as a single stuff oreo i i
2dbupGVu0As,191040,193200,can't imagine that that's the case but
2dbupGVu0As,193200,194560,we'll find out today you might think
2dbupGVu0As,194560,196400,that we're just going to be weighing the
2dbupGVu0As,196400,198239,cream but because it's a little bit
2dbupGVu0As,198239,200000,difficult to get all of the cream and
2dbupGVu0As,200000,201280,get it nice and standardized we're
2dbupGVu0As,201280,202480,actually going to be wearing the full
2dbupGVu0As,202480,205519,cookie and then the cookies without the
2dbupGVu0As,205519,207360,cream that way we're getting a standard
2dbupGVu0As,207360,209760,of a measured as we can that also allows
2dbupGVu0As,209760,211040,us in the event that we're having a hard
2dbupGVu0As,211040,213760,time getting rid of all the queen queen
2dbupGVu0As,213760,216080,the queen where's the queen filling the
2dbupGVu0As,216080,217680,other thing that this is nice to have is
2dbupGVu0As,217680,219280,if we have a hard time separating out
2dbupGVu0As,219280,221760,the cream it allows us to do things like
2dbupGVu0As,221760,223680,maybe melt it off or maybe do other
2dbupGVu0As,223680,225680,things to really get all that cream off
2dbupGVu0As,225680,227680,the cookies that melting the cream off
2dbupGVu0As,227680,229519,idea yeah i just tossed that out as a
2dbupGVu0As,229519,231360,random thought while we were recording i
2dbupGVu0As,231360,233439,would later come to regret that decision
2dbupGVu0As,233439,236080,so here's cookie number one of the great
2dbupGVu0As,236080,237920,double stuff cookie experiment here we
2dbupGVu0As,237920,240720,go
2dbupGVu0As,240720,242640,11.4
2dbupGVu0As,242640,244319,and now what we do
2dbupGVu0As,244319,246159,is we're just going to twist
2dbupGVu0As,246159,247680,got cream on both sides so we're going
2dbupGVu0As,247680,250450,to scrape it off oh yeah this is
2dbupGVu0As,250450,252799,[Music]
2dbupGVu0As,252799,255439,it's it's close
2dbupGVu0As,255439,257120,it's just like buried in the nooks and
2dbupGVu0As,257120,258479,crannies
2dbupGVu0As,258479,261440,that's the problem here
2dbupGVu0As,262720,264720,now obviously that's adding weight to
2dbupGVu0As,264720,266560,the cookie so i'm only doing that for
2dbupGVu0As,266560,268400,comedic effect yes
2dbupGVu0As,268400,270080,i see you all you science nerds you're
2dbupGVu0As,270080,271520,like the moisture is making the cookie
2dbupGVu0As,271520,273120,heavier i get it
2dbupGVu0As,273120,275600,i get it it's a joke
2dbupGVu0As,275600,278639,it's a joke i know my saliva is heavy
2dbupGVu0As,278639,280160,i've got the heavy saliva in the
2dbupGVu0As,280160,282720,business
2dbupGVu0As,282720,284240,so sorry
2dbupGVu0As,284240,286880,8.2 okay so initially i was dissatisfied
2dbupGVu0As,286880,288080,with the amount of scraping i was having
2dbupGVu0As,288080,289280,to do to get all the cream out of the
2dbupGVu0As,289280,291280,nooks and crannies and thus the great
2dbupGVu0As,291280,293360,hair dryer experiment began so we're
2dbupGVu0As,293360,295840,trying plan b
2dbupGVu0As,295840,297280,hair dryer
2dbupGVu0As,297280,299360,it's going to melt right
2dbupGVu0As,299360,300160,right
2dbupGVu0As,300160,301360,sure
2dbupGVu0As,301360,303600,let's find out together friends
2dbupGVu0As,303600,306560,for science
2dbupGVu0As,307840,310479,it's hot i'll give it that
2dbupGVu0As,310479,312240,oh yeah you can see it melting my poor
2dbupGVu0As,312240,313919,fingers
2dbupGVu0As,313919,318639,it's hot on my fingers set it on a plate
2dbupGVu0As,320400,322800,set it on the plate they say
2dbupGVu0As,322800,325360,don't burn your fingers they say
2dbupGVu0As,325360,328000,just blew it off jason as you can
2dbupGVu0As,328000,329680,probably tell the hairdryer method was
2dbupGVu0As,329680,331840,not long for this world not only was it
2dbupGVu0As,331840,333600,bad for my sensitive thingies it was
2dbupGVu0As,333600,335440,also just liquefying the cream causing
2dbupGVu0As,335440,337360,it to seep deeper into the chocolate
2dbupGVu0As,337360,339440,wafer that being said it did come with
2dbupGVu0As,339440,342160,one upside
2dbupGVu0As,342240,343060,oh yeah
2dbupGVu0As,343060,346209,[Music]
2dbupGVu0As,346639,348160,never have oreos that you're left out in
2dbupGVu0As,348160,349759,the car
2dbupGVu0As,349759,351039,and they're nice and warm and a little
2dbupGVu0As,351039,351960,melty
2dbupGVu0As,351960,353600,[Music]
2dbupGVu0As,353600,355919,that might be peak oreo where's melty
2dbupGVu0As,355919,357199,oreo flavor
2dbupGVu0As,357199,358880,that was awesome in the end we scrapped
2dbupGVu0As,358880,360319,the hairdryer and settled on more
2dbupGVu0As,360319,362720,traditional cream separation methods and
2dbupGVu0As,362720,365199,uh if it wasn't obvious yet after a few
2dbupGVu0As,365199,367360,hundred oreos both the cookies and my
2dbupGVu0As,367360,369360,sanity were starting to crumble so when
2dbupGVu0As,369360,370880,you break it down there are really three
2dbupGVu0As,370880,372960,different ways of separating an oreo
2dbupGVu0As,372960,375280,from its cream first off my personal
2dbupGVu0As,375280,379600,favorite the twist just
2dbupGVu0As,379600,380960,[Music]
2dbupGVu0As,380960,382240,smooth
2dbupGVu0As,382240,384240,so smooth number two this one's gonna do
2dbupGVu0As,384240,385039,it
2dbupGVu0As,385039,386560,the hinge joint
2dbupGVu0As,386560,388240,where you pull it open
2dbupGVu0As,388240,390319,kinda like a book look at how clean that
2dbupGVu0As,390319,393120,is this one has a high risk high reward
2dbupGVu0As,393120,395360,because you'll notice less cream on the
2dbupGVu0As,395360,397280,opposite cookie however you're going to
2dbupGVu0As,397280,399440,get a lot of breakage of the chocolate
2dbupGVu0As,399440,401600,of course number three there it is the
2dbupGVu0As,401600,404479,slide but you get the most cream on both
2dbupGVu0As,404479,406800,sides not loving the slide but there are
2dbupGVu0As,406800,408160,people out there who are like it's the
2dbupGVu0As,408160,409759,only way to go yep this is my life
2dbupGVu0As,409759,411599,discussing the minute details of people
2dbupGVu0As,411599,413440,separating the haves of a sandwich
2dbupGVu0As,413440,415120,cookie and that descent into madness
2dbupGVu0As,415120,416800,didn't just stop at cookie dissection
2dbupGVu0As,416800,418240,either it's not often that you're
2dbupGVu0As,418240,420240,presented with such a huge sample size
2dbupGVu0As,420240,422400,of oreos but when you are you start to
2dbupGVu0As,422400,424319,notice weird things about them like the
2dbupGVu0As,424319,425680,fact that the pattern on the chocolate
2dbupGVu0As,425680,427840,cookie differs from single stuff to mega
2dbupGVu0As,427840,429599,stuff the pattern on these oreos is
2dbupGVu0As,429599,431440,actually different look
2dbupGVu0As,431440,434319,here's the mega stuff
2dbupGVu0As,434319,436639,and here's the pattern for the single
2dbupGVu0As,436639,437840,stuff
2dbupGVu0As,437840,439919,it's different this one is more line
2dbupGVu0As,439919,440960,based and this one's more like
2dbupGVu0As,440960,442639,crisscross pattern based
2dbupGVu0As,442639,444160,maybe the bigger cookie has a different
2dbupGVu0As,444160,445280,line pattern to give it better
2dbupGVu0As,445280,446960,structural integrity honestly i don't
2dbupGVu0As,446960,448639,know despite the differences in texture
2dbupGVu0As,448639,450000,between the regular and mega stuff
2dbupGVu0As,450000,452000,wafers they were roughly the same weight
2dbupGVu0As,452000,453599,so maybe different manufacturing
2dbupGVu0As,453599,455360,machines it's very odd other minute
2dbupGVu0As,455360,457039,details that my cookie adult brain
2dbupGVu0As,457039,458560,noticed the double stuff oreos seem to
2dbupGVu0As,458560,460639,be packed much looser than the originals
2dbupGVu0As,460639,462479,ditto for the mega stuff varieties more
2dbupGVu0As,462479,464400,empty space meant more opportunities to
2dbupGVu0As,464400,465919,jiggle around which meant more broken
2dbupGVu0As,465919,468080,cookies and crumbs at the bottom of each
2dbupGVu0As,468080,469840,package even the number of oreos that
2dbupGVu0As,469840,471759,you get in a column isn't consistent for
2dbupGVu0As,471759,472960,the double stuff we found that some
2dbupGVu0As,472960,475120,columns had 12 cookies and some had 13.
2dbupGVu0As,475120,476879,for mega stuff the cookies per row
2dbupGVu0As,476879,478479,varied from seven to eight maybe think
2dbupGVu0As,478479,479919,back to our shrink-flation episode and
2dbupGVu0As,479919,481440,wonder if maybe this is intentional
2dbupGVu0As,481440,482720,trying to get us used to the idea of
2dbupGVu0As,482720,484560,having fewer cookies in each package
2dbupGVu0As,484560,487120,then of course you had moments like this
2dbupGVu0As,487120,489599,what is this what is this crap it's a
2dbupGVu0As,489599,493120,little minty oreo bowl you can pour your
2dbupGVu0As,493120,496080,cereal in there and scoop it out
2dbupGVu0As,496080,497680,i should sell this one on ebay it's like
2dbupGVu0As,497680,499680,a miracle like i said my cream added
2dbupGVu0As,499680,502080,brain was going to some weird places the
2dbupGVu0As,502080,503840,party size bag
2dbupGVu0As,503840,506000,party set yeah does it look like we're
2dbupGVu0As,506000,507919,really having a party here
2dbupGVu0As,507919,509759,party one
2dbupGVu0As,509759,513759,saddest party known to mankind
2dbupGVu0As,514240,518959,forever alone matpat with his mint oreos
2dbupGVu0As,518959,522479,i'm just gonna make myself feel better
2dbupGVu0As,523518,524720,that didn't make me feel better these
2dbupGVu0As,524720,526399,are delicious then on to the fins i
2dbupGVu0As,526399,528240,think we're gonna do the the pry it
2dbupGVu0As,528240,531120,apart method with these guys
2dbupGVu0As,531120,533070,oh there it is that's a win
2dbupGVu0As,533070,534480,[Music]
2dbupGVu0As,534480,536240,yeah it's like you're having a shucking
2dbupGVu0As,536240,538959,oyster check it chuck your oreos and
2dbupGVu0As,538959,541440,over to the minis oreo minis were built
2dbupGVu0As,541440,544160,to be bite-sized
2dbupGVu0As,544160,548160,this how big of a bite you think i have
2dbupGVu0As,548160,549360,yeah
2dbupGVu0As,549360,552320,you underestimate me oreo
2dbupGVu0As,552320,553600,i'll show you
2dbupGVu0As,553600,556880,i'll show you bite-sized oreos this is
2dbupGVu0As,556880,558720,bite-sized edition oreos
2dbupGVu0As,558720,561040,[Music]
2dbupGVu0As,561040,563200,after hours of taking apart and weighing
2dbupGVu0As,563200,564880,several hundred oreo cookies of
2dbupGVu0As,564880,566640,different varieties we finally came up
2dbupGVu0As,566640,568320,with our results ladies and gentlemen
2dbupGVu0As,568320,569920,our double stuff oreos really double
2dbupGVu0As,569920,574279,this stuff drum roll please
2dbupGVu0As,579360,582640,anyway the answer is yes double stuff is
2dbupGVu0As,582640,584640,almost exactly double the stuff of
2dbupGVu0As,584640,587200,regular oreos 1.97
2dbupGVu0As,587200,589120,times the stuff by our measurements but
2dbupGVu0As,589120,591839,i'm willing to chalk up that missing .03
2dbupGVu0As,591839,594399,to human error on our part it is really
2dbupGVu0As,594399,596399,tough to remove every last bit of cream
2dbupGVu0As,596399,598560,out of the wafer to truly get 100
2dbupGVu0As,598560,600480,accurate measurements so double stuff
2dbupGVu0As,600480,602320,sorry i doubted you it didn't really
2dbupGVu0As,602320,604240,seem like double the stuff but i can't
2dbupGVu0As,604240,606000,argue with the data as for the more
2dbupGVu0As,606000,608480,hefty oreos mega stuff wound up being
2dbupGVu0As,608480,611200,2.8 times the stuff and most stuff
2dbupGVu0As,611200,614160,weighed in at 3.7 times the stuff so the
2dbupGVu0As,614160,616000,mega stuff and most stuff are a little
2dbupGVu0As,616000,617600,shy of qualifying for the labels of
2dbupGVu0As,617600,620000,triple stuff and quadruple stuff but
2dbupGVu0As,620000,621519,that's probably why they went with the
2dbupGVu0As,621519,623200,more ambiguous names they didn't want to
2dbupGVu0As,623200,624959,write checks that their cookies couldn't
2dbupGVu0As,624959,626399,cash here's another thing i found
2dbupGVu0As,626399,628560,fascinating flavored oreos in our case
2dbupGVu0As,628560,630399,meant well not advertised as having
2dbupGVu0As,630399,632079,extra stuffing are actually closer to
2dbupGVu0As,632079,634000,being double stuffed oreo sizes than
2dbupGVu0As,634000,635839,regular sized i feel like these were
2dbupGVu0As,635839,638640,born out of oreo feeling threatened by
2dbupGVu0As,638640,640720,the girl scouts and thin mints they're
2dbupGVu0As,640720,642640,like okay you got your thin mints but we
2dbupGVu0As,642640,645600,got your thick mints these are default
2dbupGVu0As,645600,648320,double double stuff
2dbupGVu0As,648320,650399,they're pretty close the extra stuffing
2dbupGVu0As,650399,651600,isn't the only thing that made the mint
2dbupGVu0As,651600,653120,flavor a bit of an oddball either the
2dbupGVu0As,653120,654640,mint flavored stuffing actually has a
2dbupGVu0As,654640,656560,completely different consistency from
2dbupGVu0As,656560,658720,the regular vanilla stuff which makes it
2dbupGVu0As,658720,660240,stick to the cookies in all kinds of
2dbupGVu0As,660240,662399,interesting ways in 2016 a team of
2dbupGVu0As,662399,664160,aerospace engineers noticed that with
2dbupGVu0As,664160,666320,regular oreos this stuff always seems to
2dbupGVu0As,666320,668800,stick to one side in fact within a given
2dbupGVu0As,668800,670800,column of oreos you'll find that all of
2dbupGVu0As,670800,672959,them have the same cream orientation
2dbupGVu0As,672959,674480,twist them open the cream is always
2dbupGVu0As,674480,676320,gonna wind up on the same cookie and
2dbupGVu0As,676320,678160,this was actually something that we were
2dbupGVu0As,678160,680000,able to verify within our own tests
2dbupGVu0As,680000,681440,however when we tried to do the same
2dbupGVu0As,681440,683519,thing with the mint oreos things didn't
2dbupGVu0As,683519,686079,go quite so cleanly so watch this column
2dbupGVu0As,686079,687680,right here we're gonna take one oreo
2dbupGVu0As,687680,689279,it's a fresh column
2dbupGVu0As,689279,690959,and i'm holding it the way it was laying
2dbupGVu0As,690959,694079,in there so we do a little twist
2dbupGVu0As,694240,695920,and you'll notice
2dbupGVu0As,695920,698880,that the bottom came off from the top so
2dbupGVu0As,698880,702000,if i was here boop it's the bottom one
2dbupGVu0As,702000,704480,the next in line
2dbupGVu0As,704480,708560,should also come off so again the bottom
2dbupGVu0As,708800,711040,that didn't work at all cool
2dbupGVu0As,711040,712320,that
2dbupGVu0As,712320,714560,light
2dbupGVu0As,714560,717560,mint
2dbupGVu0As,718800,720560,ignore the aeronautics engineers who
2dbupGVu0As,720560,721519,said this
2dbupGVu0As,721519,723680,complete lie so yeah flavored oreos just
2dbupGVu0As,723680,725760,plain weird speaking of weird the oreo
2dbupGVu0As,725760,728320,fins have less cream and thinner wafers
2dbupGVu0As,728320,729600,specifically with the thins you're
2dbupGVu0As,729600,733680,getting 33 less wafer and 45 less cream
2dbupGVu0As,733680,734880,which means that if you prefer the
2dbupGVu0As,734880,736800,chocolate exterior more than the vanilla
2dbupGVu0As,736800,738800,filling oreo thins are mathematically
2dbupGVu0As,738800,741200,speaking your best choice of cookie at
2dbupGVu0As,741200,742880,least that's what i would be saying if
2dbupGVu0As,742880,745680,it wasn't for oreo minis oreo minis have
2dbupGVu0As,745680,748000,an even bigger wafer to cream ratio the
2dbupGVu0As,748000,750000,minis have 70 percent less wafer than
2dbupGVu0As,750000,753040,the regular oreo but 81 less cream if
2dbupGVu0As,753040,755360,you like chocolate over vanilla go small
2dbupGVu0As,755360,757760,also golden oreos pure mad lads they are
2dbupGVu0As,757760,760000,the embodiment of the chaotic good the
2dbupGVu0As,760000,762240,wafer weighs slightly more but they have
2dbupGVu0As,762240,765600,significantly less cream a whopping 23
2dbupGVu0As,765600,767360,percent less but then you go to the
2dbupGVu0As,767360,769279,golden double stuff oreos and you get
2dbupGVu0As,769279,772639,way more cream 2.4 times in fact but in
2dbupGVu0As,772639,774399,the end the numbers proved it completely
2dbupGVu0As,774399,776480,blowing my mind double stuff oreos are
2dbupGVu0As,776480,778560,as best as i can tell exactly what they
2dbupGVu0As,778560,780800,claim to be also here's the general rule
2dbupGVu0As,780800,782959,as it applies to oreos bigger equals
2dbupGVu0As,782959,785600,more cream smaller equals more chocolate
2dbupGVu0As,785600,787440,plan your next shopping trip accordingly
2dbupGVu0As,787440,789200,if you're a vanilla cream fan obviously
2dbupGVu0As,789200,790160,you're gonna go with more and more
2dbupGVu0As,790160,792160,stuffing but if you're a chocolate fan
2dbupGVu0As,792160,793200,you should be going after those
2dbupGVu0As,793200,795839,bite-sized oreo minis and thins or you
2dbupGVu0As,795839,797519,know you just scrap it all and go with a
2dbupGVu0As,797519,801200,hydrox instead but hey that's just a
2dbupGVu0As,801200,807120,theory a food theory bon appetit ori
2dbupGVu0As,811200,812320,how's that
2dbupGVu0As,812320,814880,it was amazing was that an res or an ori
2dbupGVu0As,814880,818320,no ory heck yes ory heck yes that's
2dbupGVu0As,818320,819839,right
2dbupGVu0As,819839,821360,it's my sound test
2dbupGVu0As,821360,823040,oreo
2dbupGVu0As,823040,824720,oreo
2dbupGVu0As,824720,827720,oreo
2dbupGVu0As,832639,834880,yes
