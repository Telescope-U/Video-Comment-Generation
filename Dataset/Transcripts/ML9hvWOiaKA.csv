ML9hvWOiaKA,3199,7440,oh nivea league of legends highlights
ML9hvWOiaKA,7440,9519,going to be the jace for
ML9hvWOiaKA,9519,11920,just for fun yep finally we get to see
ML9hvWOiaKA,11920,13840,jace here in the lck really sad it was
ML9hvWOiaKA,13840,15679,so many things it could have been and
ML9hvWOiaKA,15679,16960,then it was just
ML9hvWOiaKA,16960,20800,um nah never mind i like this uh it's
ML9hvWOiaKA,20800,22160,gonna take a while before dove is
ML9hvWOiaKA,22160,24720,actually anyway in the lead is uh okay
ML9hvWOiaKA,24720,26640,croco just going to cue into owner here
ML9hvWOiaKA,26640,28400,for a moment but owner is going to be
ML9hvWOiaKA,28400,29840,able to take at least a couple of the
ML9hvWOiaKA,29840,31840,little wolves faker claws his way out
ML9hvWOiaKA,31840,32640,now
ML9hvWOiaKA,32640,34160,how is the lee sin supposed to get out
ML9hvWOiaKA,34160,35760,of this one is the question riposte
ML9hvWOiaKA,35760,38239,comes down good charm lands from closer
ML9hvWOiaKA,38239,39840,and owners still going to flash and try
ML9hvWOiaKA,39840,41360,and safeguard out but it's not going to
ML9hvWOiaKA,41360,43760,be enough and first blood goes over to
ML9hvWOiaKA,43760,45120,crocs sit in your jungle we're going to
ML9hvWOiaKA,45120,46800,make your lives miserable and even
ML9hvWOiaKA,46800,49039,though t1 are down a kill and owner died
ML9hvWOiaKA,49039,51280,there they're up on gold just the t1
ML9hvWOiaKA,51280,52640,just two one things because it's the
ML9hvWOiaKA,52640,55120,spot also might straight up be dead is
ML9hvWOiaKA,55120,57039,kerry's just tanking the turret he
ML9hvWOiaKA,57039,59199,doesn't care at all he's ahead in farm
ML9hvWOiaKA,59199,61120,by like two waves wolf what the heck's
ML9hvWOiaKA,61120,63520,going on as faker is looking for dove
ML9hvWOiaKA,63520,65600,he's waiting for the riposte is easily
ML9hvWOiaKA,65600,67040,going to be able to take that kill faker
ML9hvWOiaKA,67040,69040,of course can go untargetable and so the
ML9hvWOiaKA,69040,71280,dive is so simple
ML9hvWOiaKA,71280,73920,and t1 answer all of that hitting level
ML9hvWOiaKA,73920,76159,six also t1 are very slow to start this
ML9hvWOiaKA,76159,77759,so like he could have gotten so much
ML9hvWOiaKA,77759,79520,more value teleport
ML9hvWOiaKA,79520,81280,is going to get picked off he's now done
ML9hvWOiaKA,81280,83200,grand challenge does come on forward
ML9hvWOiaKA,83200,85040,dawning shadow keeps us alive for so
ML9hvWOiaKA,85040,87280,long that he's manages to take down the
ML9hvWOiaKA,87280,89680,vine now can dove actually fight this
ML9hvWOiaKA,89680,91200,out as the question and carrier says
ML9hvWOiaKA,91200,93119,absolutely not hugh will connect true
ML9hvWOiaKA,93119,95360,shot barrage sails by majestically but
ML9hvWOiaKA,95360,96960,isn't going to actually do anything as
ML9hvWOiaKA,96960,99040,goom usually slinks into the mist and he
ML9hvWOiaKA,99040,101759,will be alive as well t1 going to win
ML9hvWOiaKA,101759,104399,yet another fight and then just takes
ML9hvWOiaKA,104399,105840,out of a team fight prince isn't getting
ML9hvWOiaKA,105840,107759,value on the bottom all right decent
ML9hvWOiaKA,107759,108560,counter
ML9hvWOiaKA,108560,110079,gank timing here for croco but he's
ML9hvWOiaKA,110079,112479,unable to actually find the q flash and
ML9hvWOiaKA,112479,114880,croco is just going to die kumushi now
ML9hvWOiaKA,114880,116479,underneath this turret and t1 are
ML9hvWOiaKA,116479,119439,looking to grab some plates up here
ML9hvWOiaKA,119439,121759,this game really is starting to turn
ML9hvWOiaKA,121759,123920,into uh you know purchasing some
ML9hvWOiaKA,123920,126399,crockery for your new kitchen as our
ML9hvWOiaKA,126399,127920,fake is going to get charmed not hit by
ML9hvWOiaKA,127920,129679,the over deception true damage though as
ML9hvWOiaKA,129679,131200,uh that q is going to connect and he's
ML9hvWOiaKA,131200,132560,just fighting against closer there's a
ML9hvWOiaKA,132560,134480,full minion wave there as well but t1
ML9hvWOiaKA,134480,136000,they deal with this turret and uh
ML9hvWOiaKA,136000,137280,shelley's going to look for another
ML9hvWOiaKA,137280,140000,charge here on the inner we'll get it
ML9hvWOiaKA,140000,141440,and this has been a very common play
ML9hvWOiaKA,141440,143200,style here in the lck for the santa
ML9hvWOiaKA,143200,145200,where you just roam around the map
ML9hvWOiaKA,145200,146800,with your top laner with your mid laner
ML9hvWOiaKA,146800,148160,thing on where you have control because
ML9hvWOiaKA,148160,150239,you will be able to get stacks anywhere
ML9hvWOiaKA,150239,152160,by the way that's like six points so
ML9hvWOiaKA,152160,154319,many times with these true shot barrages
ML9hvWOiaKA,154319,156560,just straight between the posts that's
ML9hvWOiaKA,156560,159280,really unfortunate now croco is going to
ML9hvWOiaKA,159280,160800,be able to try to trade this for a drake
ML9hvWOiaKA,160800,162160,he has a control board set up here so
ML9hvWOiaKA,162160,163360,they don't know that he's doing this
ML9hvWOiaKA,163360,165360,they have bought prior because tom kench
ML9hvWOiaKA,165360,167040,has been down there alone was very
ML9hvWOiaKA,167040,169040,common to do this because the tomcat
ML9hvWOiaKA,169040,172080,starts to get levels he has gold and
ML9hvWOiaKA,172080,173440,gummies he's going to be getting gold
ML9hvWOiaKA,173440,176000,and stacks wherever he is so you leave
ML9hvWOiaKA,176000,177840,the catch alone he could be anywhere you
ML9hvWOiaKA,177840,179760,will die next uh prince is like yeah i'm
ML9hvWOiaKA,179760,182000,out of here yeah and carrie is like i'm
ML9hvWOiaKA,182000,184159,beating a fiora in the side lane a long
ML9hvWOiaKA,184159,186480,pause and uh i guess they has got to
ML9hvWOiaKA,186480,188080,play top after all
ML9hvWOiaKA,188080,190080,alternate history here at the school we
ML9hvWOiaKA,190080,192480,are setting up for a gang brush
ML9hvWOiaKA,192480,194720,as owner might take the bait who was a
ML9hvWOiaKA,194720,196400,little bit frightening there he's like
ML9hvWOiaKA,196400,198959,faker checking
ML9hvWOiaKA,202600,205870,[Music]
ML9hvWOiaKA,206020,208400,[Laughter]
ML9hvWOiaKA,208400,209680,i kind of thought that that was going to
ML9hvWOiaKA,209680,211440,work because t1 were playing pretty fast
ML9hvWOiaKA,211440,214400,and loses now might be there
ML9hvWOiaKA,214400,216080,they're just luckier than you two you
ML9hvWOiaKA,216080,218879,know it's just it's not fair was bono
ML9hvWOiaKA,218879,221200,lucky
ML9hvWOiaKA,222720,224239,i don't know you said you two had to
ML9hvWOiaKA,224239,226000,make the joke as close as halting
ML9hvWOiaKA,226000,228159,there's the this will dive though as
ML9hvWOiaKA,228159,229840,kerry is just going to lick closer so he
ML9hvWOiaKA,229840,231840,presses his ultimate button and then
ML9hvWOiaKA,231840,233840,gets tongue lashed and that's uh that's
ML9hvWOiaKA,233840,236159,the end of that chapter um faker now
ML9hvWOiaKA,236159,238799,will find croco or croco found faker no
ML9hvWOiaKA,238799,240319,faker has found croco the other for us
ML9hvWOiaKA,240319,242319,comes down there's the frozen tomb that
ML9hvWOiaKA,242319,244080,queue is pretty comfy
ML9hvWOiaKA,244080,246000,and owner will help pick that one up for
ML9hvWOiaKA,246000,247680,faker
ML9hvWOiaKA,247680,249760,that's a head scratcher right there yeah
ML9hvWOiaKA,249760,251519,i mean quite literally croco was just a
ML9hvWOiaKA,251519,253439,little bit lost on that one and got
ML9hvWOiaKA,253439,255040,totally punished
ML9hvWOiaKA,255040,256959,i mean he's two levels down on baker
ML9hvWOiaKA,256959,258880,it's not gonna work out well kerry is
ML9hvWOiaKA,258880,261120,gonna get his uh fin um getting some
ML9hvWOiaKA,261120,262720,flashbacks of course doesn't work every
ML9hvWOiaKA,262720,265199,single time but in this particular game
ML9hvWOiaKA,265199,266560,it was the answer that they were looking
ML9hvWOiaKA,266560,268000,for i love the flexibility of this
ML9hvWOiaKA,268000,269199,composition
ML9hvWOiaKA,269199,271440,from t1 just with the fact that you have
ML9hvWOiaKA,271440,273360,carrier as like a side lane tank if you
ML9hvWOiaKA,273360,274400,want it
ML9hvWOiaKA,274400,276560,right it's just uh it's just pretty cute

ML9hvWOiaKA,277600,279120,side wherever you want it yeah where do
ML9hvWOiaKA,279120,280720,you want to chief well here's the
ML9hvWOiaKA,280720,282479,abyssal dive as kerry is going to look

ML9hvWOiaKA,284720,286800,been issued now and dove says no i don't
ML9hvWOiaKA,286800,288560,think i really want that one as that's

ML9hvWOiaKA,292240,293919,t1 get exactly what they want though is
ML9hvWOiaKA,293919,295759,croco wants round two not able to get
ML9hvWOiaKA,295759,297280,the punch off
ML9hvWOiaKA,297280,299280,and uh faker just claws his way out he
ML9hvWOiaKA,299280,301360,didn't know where closer was so playing
ML9hvWOiaKA,301360,303919,it safe as uh yeah those hit pretty hard
ML9hvWOiaKA,303919,304880,yeah
ML9hvWOiaKA,304880,306080,nice little shield to be set up there
ML9hvWOiaKA,306080,307360,from cal just to make sure he takes as
ML9hvWOiaKA,307360,309199,little damage as possible but uh this
