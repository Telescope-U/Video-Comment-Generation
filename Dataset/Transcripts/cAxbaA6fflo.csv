cAxbaA6fflo,19600,22160,move the heifers in this pen and in this
cAxbaA6fflo,22160,24960,pen so we can chase these two pastures
cAxbaA6fflo,24960,27039,through these pens up into the crowl
cAxbaA6fflo,27039,29039,we'll give the cavs a pink guy shot and

cAxbaA6fflo,185120,187200,in that pasture with the tall grass i
cAxbaA6fflo,187200,188640,think we ran through a family of skunks
cAxbaA6fflo,188640,190000,a couple times
cAxbaA6fflo,190000,191920,and there's one cow in here

cAxbaA6fflo,297199,298960,them all the way back out i'm sure
cAxbaA6fflo,298960,300960,they're excited for that jump but we did
cAxbaA6fflo,300960,302720,it on a cooler day in the morning and so
cAxbaA6fflo,302720,304639,it's not too bad and then
cAxbaA6fflo,304639,306160,later today you'll probably find them
cAxbaA6fflo,306160,308000,sitting in a water puddle and under a
cAxbaA6fflo,308000,309680,tree the other option we could have went
cAxbaA6fflo,309680,311840,with besides chasing them up would be
cAxbaA6fflo,311840,313919,setting up our portable corral but
cAxbaA6fflo,313919,314880,that's
cAxbaA6fflo,314880,317120,a lot of work and it's a lot less safe
cAxbaA6fflo,317120,319280,for us and the cattle i mean we got a
cAxbaA6fflo,319280,321440,state of the art setup here so it's
cAxbaA6fflo,321440,323520,pretty feasible to just bring them home
cAxbaA6fflo,323520,325600,and work them and it worked well we also
cAxbaA6fflo,325600,327440,have something showing up today
cAxbaA6fflo,327440,329039,and we pulling in the yard it's another

cAxbaA6fflo,683600,685360,business with the future
cAxbaA6fflo,685360,687360,relatives so that's cool
cAxbaA6fflo,687360,689279,and um
cAxbaA6fflo,689279,692079,yep been a cool night dealer for
cAxbaA6fflo,692079,693920,probably pushing 20 years my dad started
cAxbaA6fflo,693920,696480,the business 46 years ago he is just
cAxbaA6fflo,696480,699040,this year uh retired sort of and sold
cAxbaA6fflo,699040,702120,the business
cAxbaA6fflo,705200,707200,like you said this is a used unit and
cAxbaA6fflo,707200,708800,the problem is you know with uh
cAxbaA6fflo,708800,710639,inventory and all that it's hard to come
cAxbaA6fflo,710639,712959,by the newer stuff and so they obviously
cAxbaA6fflo,712959,715040,did a really good job kind of rebuilding
cAxbaA6fflo,715040,716800,it painting it putting some new stuff on
cAxbaA6fflo,716800,718480,it looks really nice went through all
cAxbaA6fflo,718480,720480,the bearings and the
cAxbaA6fflo,720480,721760,new scales
cAxbaA6fflo,721760,723600,um this thing is equipped with uh the
cAxbaA6fflo,723600,725279,weight the way system so he can weigh
cAxbaA6fflo,725279,726720,out and he's got a side read out on the
cAxbaA6fflo,726720,728160,side so as he's loading it he has that
cAxbaA6fflo,728160,729680,and then he's got an in-cab remote
cAxbaA6fflo,729680,731040,basically just went through everything
cAxbaA6fflo,731040,732880,and made it look like it's new because
cAxbaA6fflo,732880,734240,like he said it's very tough right now
cAxbaA6fflo,734240,735279,with the
cAxbaA6fflo,735279,737519,supply chain to get new equipment in
cAxbaA6fflo,737519,739360,fact nights at least 12 to 13
cAxbaA6fflo,739360,741839,months out if you'd even order one
cAxbaA6fflo,741839,742959,and the prices have increased
cAxbaA6fflo,742959,745200,dramatically so yeah you guys something
