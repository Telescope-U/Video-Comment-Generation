QyB5ofy9RaY,577079,580019,artichoke next up I got to make Pikachu so we gotta get some rice here you gotta
QyB5ofy9RaY,580019,582839,turn it yellow so here we go add the yellow color in like this I'm thinking
QyB5ofy9RaY,582839,586410,this is gonna be more 3d than my art normally is so I'm gonna actually have
QyB5ofy9RaY,586410,589529,his foot coming outside of the box and I'm gonna use these carrots a little
QyB5ofy9RaY,589529,592140,chopsticks to grab the chunks of rice here we go there's gonna be Pikachu's
QyB5ofy9RaY,592140,595079,head so here we go this next one - Pikachu's body like this the issuer's
QyB5ofy9RaY,595079,597570,I've got too much yellow rice for Pikachu so I've got a different idea
QyB5ofy9RaY,597570,600480,we're gonna make half of Pikachu's head over here so half of the mystery is
QyB5ofy9RaY,600480,602880,we're the other half of his head go I think it's time to move on to the
QyB5ofy9RaY,602880,607079,background I've got the base done so now I just gotta add this lettuce in here

QyB5ofy9RaY,615089,619020,correctly the key to the background is to take this lettuce and roll it up just
QyB5ofy9RaY,619020,622260,like this then place it in next up time for Detective Pikachu's eyes I'm gonna
QyB5ofy9RaY,622260,624779,use a mushroom right now first represent his eye
