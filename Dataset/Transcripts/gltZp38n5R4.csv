gltZp38n5R4,97280,103680,but um yeah man i mean you're just doing  the damn thing i mean your book's  crushing it you're on this freaking pr
gltZp38n5R4,103680,109280,tour man  exhausting though  it's a lot yeah something like the first
gltZp38n5R4,109280,114399,week every day was like  16 to 20 media interactions
gltZp38n5R4,114399,121280,in a day so it'd be like a 20 hour day  sleep for four hours  so like i was like yeah write a book do
gltZp38n5R4,121280,127680,you really want to write a book but also  for guys like you i mean there's some  people who love it but  for you're like constantly talking about
gltZp38n5R4,127680,133599,you're promoting you know yourself or  you gotta it's like especially when you  have that many energies back to back
gltZp38n5R4,133599,138640,because i'm sure you're like me i'm like  i don't want i don't want everyone to  hear the same story but you gotta give
gltZp38n5R4,138640,144400,them the meat and potatoes yeah so by  the second day like yeah it's uh it's a  good special man you know i just tell
gltZp38n5R4,144400,150480,jokes it's like i just just watched the  goddamn thing yeah it's like yeah yeah  but important you know i get it the the
gltZp38n5R4,150480,155519,the book is it's a carrier for the you  know it's a cracker for the caviar and  the caviar is the same things that you
gltZp38n5R4,155519,161040,preach you know like we're trying to  encourage people to be better versions  than themselves like stronger healthier
gltZp38n5R4,161040,167440,like a fitter america a more prepared  america you know so  i just talk about all my failures all
gltZp38n5R4,167440,174160,the things i didn't do right that's my  takeaway from your book is i think  you know i didn't know what to expect  going into it but your book a lot of it
gltZp38n5R4,174160,179760,is about your failures which you really  don't i mean i don't know when you would  talk about it really but it's a lot of
gltZp38n5R4,179760,186560,like you being at some low points in  your life yeah yeah i mean it's  different you know you look back at your  your fight career and you see in the
gltZp38n5R4,186560,192159,octagon your hands getting raised you  won and everybody looks at that  especially current day in the curated
gltZp38n5R4,192159,198080,you know editorialized sense where it's  filters i look fantastic i get to show  all these photos where i look the best
gltZp38n5R4,198080,204159,but you know what they didn't see is  like you in the gym you grinding every  single day you would be like man i  cannot get up i don't want to get up my
gltZp38n5R4,204159,209840,legs hurt i have not recovered the coach  said hey you coming in let's do another  pad session you got spit coming out of
gltZp38n5R4,209840,216799,your mouth you know  like is that me or is that my gloves  but like that's what it is really like  nobody talks about those moments nobody
gltZp38n5R4,216799,222879,talks about the grind nobody talks about  the failures like i look back at being a  10 year old wrestling and losing my
gltZp38n5R4,222879,227920,first wrestling tournament getting  pinned in a single elimination  tournament and how ashamed and
gltZp38n5R4,227920,233040,humiliated i was i couldn't even look at  my dad you know i was like yeah you're  like gymnasium everybody's looking at me
gltZp38n5R4,233040,239280,priceless lessons so important those are  the moments that people don't talk about  but should be talking about especially
gltZp38n5R4,239280,245680,in the in this 2022 world boom that's  the key i think right now the reason why  you're booked like literally i told the
gltZp38n5R4,245680,250720,guys like you gave me a signed book read  the book but i told i forgot at the  house i'm like i told my guys to go hey
gltZp38n5R4,250720,257120,go pick up a couple books put them on  the table doing food truck like oh i'll  run up to barnes noble they're that 10  a.m right one open like dude there's
gltZp38n5R4,257120,262240,only one and it was in the like the  front for marketing and they don't they  sold out yeah i'm like yeah they're sold
gltZp38n5R4,262240,268639,out everywhere and i think  you hit it at like literally just the  sweet spot like right now americans this
gltZp38n5R4,268639,274000,is what we need man they need it you  know top guns killing it  and people are just like they're
gltZp38n5R4,274000,279280,starving for real experts they're  starving for truth they're starving for  transparency they're starving for
gltZp38n5R4,279280,287440,vulnerability they're just starving for  real people they're starving for  realness and they're starving for  someone that's made the walk lives by it
gltZp38n5R4,287440,294320,but it can speak on experience it's not  [ __ ] it's not marketing like we  don't need to create some hype sizzle
gltZp38n5R4,294320,300080,that this book is good are you doing  this stuff it's like you've walked the  walk and you're like man here it is
gltZp38n5R4,300080,306320,you know i'm dumb if i can do it you  know  you guys can do it  do you should write a book
gltZp38n5R4,306320,311680,seriously it's gonna be amazing i'll be  the first one to read it yeah i love it  man  yeah i don't know it's gonna be as good
gltZp38n5R4,311680,317759,as yours yeah i think uh it's just  perfect timing and like when you talk  about those low points in your life you
gltZp38n5R4,317759,323120,know knowing you and how positive you  are it's like holy i mean  there was some desperation there's some
gltZp38n5R4,323120,329280,wild there's a reason why you're like  this yeah you know yeah and it's it's  the litany of choices you know it's not
gltZp38n5R4,329280,335120,just like the superhero  decided to make this moment and that's  the that's the pivotal and all of a
gltZp38n5R4,335120,340639,sudden he tears his shirt off there's an  s and a cape you know instead it's like  lots of tiny little decisions that build
gltZp38n5R4,340639,346880,on top of each other slowly turning the  trajectory of where our life is going to  go for a long time i would be dying of
gltZp38n5R4,346880,352880,age i would be in prison you know i'd be  a multi-time felon for violent stuff  instead you know martial arts came in
gltZp38n5R4,352880,358720,there you know the military came in  there and those tiny little things  started making differences to ultimately
gltZp38n5R4,358720,365199,not make me do it be a total piece of  trash but do you encounter on this but  do you feel uh
gltZp38n5R4,365199,372000,any pressure like responsibility like to  get your voice out there because  i think you know for me whether it's
gltZp38n5R4,372000,377680,athletes some comics i look up to but  athletes i really don't because i've  been in that world but the people that i
gltZp38n5R4,377680,384080,gravitate towards are people in the  special forces that were the the elite  units the tip of the spare and i think
gltZp38n5R4,384080,389120,now especially in 2022 so and really i  think for the past i don't know maybe
gltZp38n5R4,389120,394639,five six years you've been doing long on  that but you guys finally have a  platform and people need this
gltZp38n5R4,394639,401520,information like people are dying for  this information before there's really  no outlet for you like you it's like the  secret society you know and then now
gltZp38n5R4,401520,406880,there's people like you jocko who can  give to the world and give this  knowledge where we might people most
gltZp38n5R4,406880,413199,people aren't special forces and can  never relate to that it's just you know  we can relate to some of it yeah it's
gltZp38n5R4,413199,419039,we're our own worst enemy the motto  special forces is the quiet  professionals so dear personal liberia
gltZp38n5R4,419039,424960,to free the oppressed which is pretty  irrelevant right now you know in like a  post-covered world liberators of the
gltZp38n5R4,424960,430400,oppressed but  we are our own worst enemies in the  sense that um we're not supposed to talk
gltZp38n5R4,430400,437520,about what we do like if you hear about  us doing something it's usually because  we messed up so it's ingrained in our  culture not to talk about it but i think
gltZp38n5R4,437520,442960,guys like you know evan and matt best  and jared taylor you know black rifle  guys i love those guys
gltZp38n5R4,442960,450560,from um  field craft survival jocko like all of  these  people have they know how important it
gltZp38n5R4,450560,455759,is for these  nuggets of wisdom and how relevant it is  you guys also have a special skill set
gltZp38n5R4,455759,461280,too though like you're a great speaker  like you're motivational like jocko when  he did the biden was like this is how i
gltZp38n5R4,461280,467440,would take ownership i we're watching  fine kid dude i was yeah i've only done  this maybe twice in my life i've during
gltZp38n5R4,467440,472639,draco's thing and then after the top gun  got done i had popcorn here and i was  like this during top gun obviously i'm

gltZp38n5R4,818880,823920,secretive about  yeah he like takes this off the camera
gltZp38n5R4,823920,829199,he's like here's if we're gonna do this  also the sprite um but uh
gltZp38n5R4,829199,834399,now last time you were on food truck uh  i won't say the name of the truck but
gltZp38n5R4,834399,840160,they were steamed burgers  and i was so embarrassed  as a texan if you were like hey i'm
gltZp38n5R4,840160,845920,gonna take this meat  and i'm gonna steam it what are we doing  you lost me i was out too i'm gonna take
gltZp38n5R4,845920,852000,moisture and water and i'm gonna cook  meat with it i'm like  i'm gonna take all the juiciness out and
gltZp38n5R4,852000,857760,just i get what he's trying to do i  don't trying to always trying to be  healthy oh gotcha that was the goal  instead of like cooking it on the grill
gltZp38n5R4,857760,864480,where it's cooking in fat literally you  know medium flavor yeah that's the stuff  flavor daddy yeah you know what i'm  saying like why do i like a rib eye yeah
gltZp38n5R4,864480,871839,come on do what we do so hopefully these  are better because that was a tough sell  but the uh
gltZp38n5R4,873279,879360,i always question the appropriate  etiquette and technique of eating  because you know deep throat that thing
gltZp38n5R4,879360,883000,exactly i mean
gltZp38n5R4,885920,891040,all right  it's good i mean it's solid hot whey i  mean it's hot salt hot one i want i want
gltZp38n5R4,891040,896720,it's tough to mess up the hot sauce this  is standard i'm gonna judge him based  off his secret stuff
gltZp38n5R4,896720,902399,his own recipes yeah because i can't get  that anywhere else well i think i mean  he made this by himself there's like  strong vinegar
gltZp38n5R4,902399,909680,it's good curly salt  salt fries um now for you
gltZp38n5R4,909680,915519,i'm surprised dude and i think i know  the answer i heard you talking to our  buddy joe rogan about this
gltZp38n5R4,915519,920560,i'm surprised you haven't gotten  involved in politics  now that being said hold on let me bring
gltZp38n5R4,920560,926800,that most politicians are narcissists  and crazy and you know but that's why it  might be good for somebody like you to
gltZp38n5R4,926800,932079,get involved but i don't know if  somebody like you can get involved not  be compromised like i don't know if you
gltZp38n5R4,932079,937120,can make the changes that need to be  made  well compromising is not really
gltZp38n5R4,937120,943440,in in my character don't really have it  in me that's why i'm saying but it seems  like to get anything done there you have
gltZp38n5R4,943440,949120,to make compromises  and i'm just not down for any of them  and um
gltZp38n5R4,949120,954560,but you you're like a rap like you deal  with a lot of it like  like whenever something happens like
gltZp38n5R4,954560,960160,clearly i'm not in the government or  politics but like with afghanistan  you're the i don't know i learn i don't
gltZp38n5R4,960160,966560,have the information the background of  it you're the closest person i know to  would have a great perspective so
gltZp38n5R4,966560,971920,i didn't give my opinion i text you  about yo dude like was it a bad idea  good and you broke it down for me i'm
gltZp38n5R4,971920,978880,like all right well then that's what i'm  going to regurgitate yeah there every  one of those problems are so complex  with so much nuance and like so many
gltZp38n5R4,978880,985199,different solutions um from  for me and like the organizations that i  work for civil allies for example you
gltZp38n5R4,985199,990880,know we just find a a problem  a niche that can't be solved by anybody  but us
gltZp38n5R4,990880,997279,you know  for example like the u.n uh afghanistan  during the withdrawal  you have these huge organizations
gltZp38n5R4,997279,1002880,samaritan's purse like these are billion  dollar non-profits but they can't get
gltZp38n5R4,1002880,1008560,outside of kabul right they could land  in the airport or maybe they couldn't  even land they they couldn't
gltZp38n5R4,1008560,1014160,fund a plane to physically land in  afghanistan to get people out but they  had money and they wanted to do
gltZp38n5R4,1014160,1020480,something so they needed a specific  skill set of people to be able to go  not just land a plane in a combat zone
gltZp38n5R4,1020480,1026480,but then go out into the city into  into a war zone yeah  find people and bring them out special
gltZp38n5R4,1026480,1034000,skills yeah and then like in ukraine  when you look at the red cross or  samaritan's purse um like lots of people
gltZp38n5R4,1034000,1040720,are funneling tons of  humanitarian aid in but how much of that  stuff is making it to the front lines
gltZp38n5R4,1040720,1046720,well cool it's making the border of  poland  the border of poland is not under war  right now like that they're not the ones
gltZp38n5R4,1046720,1052720,getting bombed you have to go all the  way to the russian border where like the  nipro and the mirror pools
gltZp38n5R4,1052720,1059039,and that's super dicey that last mile  that's where save our allies  can you know take all of this stuff from
gltZp38n5R4,1059039,1065200,these huge organizations and go and  impact change and make sure it's getting  to the people need to get to because a
gltZp38n5R4,1065200,1070720,lot of these organizations i'm sure is  just like look we raised whatever 100  million bucks yeah we did our part yeah
gltZp38n5R4,1070720,1076960,yeah it's nice but you didn't do  anything yeah it's not it's not helping  them so without trying to get into the  politics of stuff i just try to find
gltZp38n5R4,1076960,1083600,work mr rogers i love this quote you  know when bad things are happening  he said always look to the helpers
gltZp38n5R4,1083600,1089200,there's always somebody  doing work  trying to help and uh and that's what i
gltZp38n5R4,1089200,1095280,try to do  in these big horrific moments where  school shootings um
gltZp38n5R4,1095280,1101200,afghanistan withdrawal  ukraine right now like what can i do to  actually make change make a difference
gltZp38n5R4,1101200,1106799,yeah politics is off the table for me  just because of some of my life  decisions yeah it makes sense but uh nor
gltZp38n5R4,1106799,1112880,would you want to be involved in that  but  i think too  for you like all these  topics you're talking about you talk
gltZp38n5R4,1112880,1119120,about you know ukraine talk about  afghanistan talk about mass shooters and  schools it's all hot topics like
gltZp38n5R4,1119120,1124320,triggering topics yeah like society's so  divisive on it you know so it's like no
gltZp38n5R4,1124320,1130160,matter what you do you're gonna get you  know these people upset or these people  ride for you it's like you're dealing
gltZp38n5R4,1130160,1135440,with like such touchy subjects if you're  paying attention to that stuff you know  or you don't can you just keep fighting
gltZp38n5R4,1135440,1140720,the good fight yeah i think i'll just  keep fighting the good fight and  you know i i think the majority i know
gltZp38n5R4,1140720,1146240,it feels like we're the most  separated and divided that we've ever  been  on social media yeah yeah exactly but
gltZp38n5R4,1146240,1151280,like when you actually get down to the  issues you and you're with people that  are trying to impact change
gltZp38n5R4,1151280,1157120,you have people from every walk every  religion every style of life being like  how can i help and that's been really
gltZp38n5R4,1157120,1164559,empower that's been really empowering  and encouraging  where it's  as most people felt disheartened
gltZp38n5R4,1164559,1169679,i just see  americans doing great things i'm like  this is this is awesome
gltZp38n5R4,1169679,1176640,because that's what i was going to ask  you because you go to some  you know  with what you do for for your job title
gltZp38n5R4,1176640,1182080,you know you see some pretty horrific  stuff you know some pretty desperate  dire times
gltZp38n5R4,1182080,1188720,i can't imagine because you're like such  a positive like happy person go lucky  person  it takes a special type of mindset to
gltZp38n5R4,1188720,1194240,deal with that stuff because like i had  a situation months ago where i helped  this family out that was in a car
gltZp38n5R4,1194240,1200880,accident the father tried killing the  family whatever i got the kids out of  the car  just me i had to go see a therapist just
gltZp38n5R4,1200880,1208400,the trauma from that really messed me up  and it made me so sad for weeks dude  yeah and dealing with what you see
gltZp38n5R4,1208400,1215039,i've seen as we come into them like i  can't like your mental space it must  just be  like either you're just
gltZp38n5R4,1215039,1220400,so  used to it and you know how to handle it  or  you know
gltZp38n5R4,1220400,1227440,you you're  do you see a therapist like how do you  deal with this because you see the worst  of the worst in the world but honestly
gltZp38n5R4,1227440,1233120,my my therapy is doing more work  you know i not that the greater good is
gltZp38n5R4,1233120,1239360,ever  because a great good could be used to  um justify and rationalize horrible
gltZp38n5R4,1239360,1244640,things but  like my approach is man if i if i can  keep going out and doing good and
gltZp38n5R4,1244640,1250960,impacting change and you know helping  americans and helping america's policies  overseas
gltZp38n5R4,1250960,1257120,and um saving more people's lives  when the plane's taken off from  afghanistan and i'm thinking about the
gltZp38n5R4,1257120,1262880,tens of thousands of people left behind  you're like that could kill you like the  women and children that literally have
gltZp38n5R4,1262880,1268159,to be like you have to stay i can't  bring you in no literally i had to tell  women that not for me yeah but i'm also
gltZp38n5R4,1268159,1273760,sitting on this plane on the c-17 i'm  looking around there's 400 people on  this plane and all of them for the first
gltZp38n5R4,1273760,1279840,time are breathing  a breath of  freedom not under the impending doom of
gltZp38n5R4,1279840,1285679,the taliban they can relax a little bit  you can relax and then i'm already  thinking like what is my next thing that  i can do what is my next mission that
gltZp38n5R4,1285679,1292400,i'm going to do you almost don't have  time to focus on that exactly just just  keep moving  you're like you know in a fight when um
gltZp38n5R4,1292400,1297760,the fight's not going exactly according  to plan  you know do i focus on the way that i'm  losing
gltZp38n5R4,1297760,1303360,no i focus on what is the the clearest  nearest thing that i can do figure out  the problem right and then start

gltZp38n5R4,1645360,1650880,knife on the map where i get on the mat  and i go five rolls in a row
gltZp38n5R4,1650880,1656640,where  three of the rules i'm just trying to  survive  like literally i'm just trying to not

gltZp38n5R4,1841919,1847840,question  if you have a  healthy f everything's easier when  you're fit right so he still does real
gltZp38n5R4,1847840,1853120,estate he still runs his businesses you  know he's still actively involved in all  those things and and that's what i don't
gltZp38n5R4,1853120,1858880,want to do is set down the sword lose  the edge both mentally physically i  don't think you can not then i can't
gltZp38n5R4,1858880,1864640,you're mentally it's not it's not in you  no you know what i'm saying  yeah i don't want to either i wouldn't
gltZp38n5R4,1864640,1870240,either there's nothing worse than when  you know you see a person who used to be  in phenomenal shape or they're at the
gltZp38n5R4,1870240,1876159,peak of their career with a comedian or  fighter act or whatever and they seem  like 10 12 years later you're like what
gltZp38n5R4,1876159,1882159,happened  there's nothing worse they think  themselves we step on the mat with danny  cormier in 10 years from now
gltZp38n5R4,1882159,1888080,is it still going to be frightening  yeah  you're like dead he's going to stay  coaching he's going to he's going to
gltZp38n5R4,1888080,1894399,stay healthy he'll be like getting a  little bit more around there dan i see  you know but the dude is still gonna  pick you up and throw you across the mat
gltZp38n5R4,1894399,1899679,and any which way yeah you know khabib  and 20 years from now oh nightmare he's  gonna be a nightmare but these outliers
gltZp38n5R4,1899679,1905360,like the mindset like i can't not work  out no matter what if i wasn't doing  this if i was on stage on cameras i
gltZp38n5R4,1905360,1911279,don't i just can't it's just not in me  yeah like on the comedy like that's a  that's a cognitive intellectual
gltZp38n5R4,1911279,1916480,exercise stand-up comedy that that i i  think is the most acute way you know via
gltZp38n5R4,1916480,1923840,debate or in in this era where  people aren't communicating where people  are not having any dialogue between them
gltZp38n5R4,1923840,1930480,or doing it 140 characters yeah you know  it's tough yeah but comedians you take  issues you break them down you find the
gltZp38n5R4,1930480,1937919,humor in them and then you reassemble  them and then you talk about them in  ways that are palatable by like that is  a really hard complex thing to do it's
gltZp38n5R4,1937919,1944320,tough as well especially in today's  climate too yeah there's some comedians  who are staying away from certain  subjects so dumb it's like no that's
gltZp38n5R4,1944320,1949919,that's why we're here man yeah like the  comedians need to be the ones that can  touch those subjects i want mel brooks
gltZp38n5R4,1949919,1955360,to be able to come back on again and  make  any of the movies that he like there's
gltZp38n5R4,1955360,1960720,no way any of the movies that he ever  made oh there's a ton of movies out judd  apatow movies won't be made no way no

gltZp38n5R4,1984080,1989200,well so you just label them and tell  which ones which looks it's pretty easy  though i would assume that's the sausage

gltZp38n5R4,2120960,2126079,do you ever watch fights when on this do  you ever watch fights like obviously is  he's the
gltZp38n5R4,2126079,2131680,style banners the the current champion  you ever watch him and think how you do  against him all the time especially him
gltZp38n5R4,2131680,2138160,right now i knew you did do you remember  when i watched him  sitting down the store and i can't do it  i watched him fight him like oh i could
gltZp38n5R4,2138160,2143520,hit him right now i could get inside  like stylistically it's a great  grappling your cardio could be some
gltZp38n5R4,2143520,2149680,issues yeah he he uh he doesn't like to  be in deep water he likes to set the  pace he likes to control range he likes
gltZp38n5R4,2149680,2156640,he's very good at controlling he really  is but like  joelle could have been the guy that put  the pressure on to pick some angles and
gltZp38n5R4,2156640,2163440,to mess with timing but he didn't you  all just like  hung back and fought the worst one of  the worst championship fights ever
gltZp38n5R4,2163440,2168960,complete nightmare for you like the  khabib style of you don't know if i'm  gonna take you down maybe i'm gonna hit  you with a big overhand right as i
gltZp38n5R4,2168960,2174320,change levels maybe i'm gonna come in  and push up kip's cage like nobody's  done that to him
gltZp38n5R4,2174320,2179440,they've tried right like brunson tried  some guys have tried it's just it's  easier said than done but he hasn't had
gltZp38n5R4,2179440,2186640,like a straight up grappler with a gas  tank that's closing the gap he's gonna  make it a dirty fight for 25 minutes
gltZp38n5R4,2186640,2192720,just knocked it a little bit gaslum did  but then and then he backed off and  didn't have the tank and then got lit up  great fight by the way one of the best
gltZp38n5R4,2192720,2197839,ones  of all time yeah so like yeah but you're  watching me like i want to get in there
