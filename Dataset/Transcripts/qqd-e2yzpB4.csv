qqd-e2yzpB4,4000,6600,"Hi friends, welcome to Study hall"
qqd-e2yzpB4,6600,10865,"A web series made by the Figma for education team. My name is Miggi, I am a Designer Advocate"
qqd-e2yzpB4,10866,14732,for education here at Figma. I work with educators and students on getting the most 
qqd-e2yzpB4,14733,18533,out of Figma and FigJam for their classroom. Today we are going to be talking about
qqd-e2yzpB4,18533,19933,Upgrading education teams
qqd-e2yzpB4,19933,21099,Creating education teams
qqd-e2yzpB4,21100,25033,and inviting students to those education teams so you can collaborate
qqd-e2yzpB4,25033,27799,and work together in the same space. Let's go!
qqd-e2yzpB4,27800,30966,Here I am in Figma. This is figma.com
qqd-e2yzpB4,30966,32866,Where you can go and you can sign up
qqd-e2yzpB4,32866,33599,for an account
qqd-e2yzpB4,33600,37166,"Once you sign up for an account, you can register and get verified"
qqd-e2yzpB4,37166,41599,for your education team. Once you have been verified
qqd-e2yzpB4,41600,45100,"for your education team, you can then go back to Figma "
qqd-e2yzpB4,45100,49600,"Now when you come back to Figma, you will see a few things. First off"
qqd-e2yzpB4,49600,53032,"You will see ""Upgrade plan for unlimited design files and teams"""
qqd-e2yzpB4,53033,57599,"By verifying, it doesn't automatically create an education team for you"
qqd-e2yzpB4,57600,60933,You will need to do so manually. I'm going to go ahead and hit upgrade. 
qqd-e2yzpB4,60933,65166,"Here you will see ""professional"" and it will say ""free for students and educators"""
qqd-e2yzpB4,65166,69599,"Let's go ahead an upgrade to professional, and here I am going to click ""upgrade"""
qqd-e2yzpB4,69600,73600,I'm going to choose that this is designated as an Education team
qqd-e2yzpB4,73600,77600,and now I am able to review and complete my upgrade
qqd-e2yzpB4,77600,81600,You will see that this is now provided at no cost for me
qqd-e2yzpB4,81600,85600,So I can actually go back to my team and you will see
qqd-e2yzpB4,85600,89600,now that this is labelled as an education team. Let me zoom into
qqd-e2yzpB4,89600,93600,that for you. So this is now an education team for education users
qqd-e2yzpB4,93600,97600,only. At this point you can now invite students to collaborate
qqd-e2yzpB4,97600,101600,with you on this team. But let's first show you how to
qqd-e2yzpB4,101600,105600,create a new team. So lets say you have
qqd-e2yzpB4,105600,109600,multiple classes. Im going to go ahead and choose create new team
qqd-e2yzpB4,109600,113600,here is my team name. I am going to say that this is my new class
qqd-e2yzpB4,113600,115933,you know UX 
qqd-e2yzpB4,115933,119933,101. I am going to go ahead and create that team
qqd-e2yzpB4,119933,122999,"here it is going to ask for my collaborators, I can just skip that. "
qqd-e2yzpB4,123000,127000,and here I am going to choose my team plan. You will now notice this education option over here on the right
qqd-e2yzpB4,127000,131000,and this will only show up if you are verified. So now
qqd-e2yzpB4,131000,134733,"I can complete that upgrade, and you can now see my UX 101 team"
qqd-e2yzpB4,134733,138733,This team will be your space to create projects
qqd-e2yzpB4,138733,138899,`
qqd-e2yzpB4,138900,142900,where you can create new design files. So I can create a new FigJam file
qqd-e2yzpB4,142900,143900,I can create a new design file
qqd-e2yzpB4,143900,145066,in this place
qqd-e2yzpB4,145066,149066,and what we are going to do next is invite our students to join us
qqd-e2yzpB4,149633,153633,with these teams. 
qqd-e2yzpB4,153633,157633,"With this team right here, I am going to head on over to invite members"
qqd-e2yzpB4,157633,161633,"and here you will see an ""invite link"" and I "
qqd-e2yzpB4,161633,165633,can choose whether or not to allow those individuals clicking that link
qqd-e2yzpB4,165633,169633,to view or edit the team. I am going to go ahead and give them edit access
qqd-e2yzpB4,169633,173633,and I can copy that link. So with this link I can now
qqd-e2yzpB4,173633,177633,share it to my LMS (learning management system) and/or with my students
qqd-e2yzpB4,177633,181633,to allow them to join my team. You will see here there is a little setting
qqd-e2yzpB4,181633,185633,where I can reset those invite links or turn them off if I feel that
qqd-e2yzpB4,185633,189633,"that link has been abused, or if it is beyond the date that I want them to join."
qqd-e2yzpB4,189633,193633,"So you can also invite them by email, but I highly recommend"
qqd-e2yzpB4,193633,197633,creating and copying these links and sharing it with them
qqd-e2yzpB4,197633,201633,Lets show you what the experience will be like for your students
qqd-e2yzpB4,201633,205633,"Lets copy that link, and I am going to head on over to this other browser"
qqd-e2yzpB4,205633,209633,so I am going to paste that link to this browser and you'll notice
qqd-e2yzpB4,209633,213633,that its immediately going to ask me to sign in. If your students don't
qqd-e2yzpB4,213633,217633,"have an account, they can create a new one ... mcardona"
qqd-e2yzpB4,217633,221633,lets just say plus 100 @ 
qqd-e2yzpB4,221633,225633,[ mumbles rest of email ]
qqd-e2yzpB4,225633,229633,that's just a test email that I have
qqd-e2yzpB4,229633,233633,"lets just create a password. So I am going to create an account, it will then ask your student"
qqd-e2yzpB4,233633,237633,"a little bit about themselves. I'll just say ""Student Miggi"".. What kind of work"
qqd-e2yzpB4,237633,241633,"do I do, ""I am in design"" and ""I will be teaching or taking a class"""
qqd-e2yzpB4,241633,245633,"so as a student, I will be taking a class. So I am going to join that"
qqd-e2yzpB4,245633,249633,mailing list and create an account. What will happen next
qqd-e2yzpB4,249633,250765,is I am going to
qqd-e2yzpB4,250766,254766,be prompted to verify my email. So offscreen right now
qqd-e2yzpB4,254766,258765,I am verifying the email. I am going to copy that link address
qqd-e2yzpB4,258765,262766,and paste it right here. So I am going to verify that account. So you can see that
qqd-e2yzpB4,262766,266766,my email has been verified and now Im going to join
qqd-e2yzpB4,266766,270766,the UX 101 team with my Student Miggi account
qqd-e2yzpB4,270766,274766,so there it is. I have now joined and you will see from the student perspective
qqd-e2yzpB4,274766,278766,they are going to be prompted to validate for education
qqd-e2yzpB4,278766,282766,so it says I only have 7 days left to verify that I am a student or educator
qqd-e2yzpB4,282766,286766,Im going to go-ahead as a student and verify that status
qqd-e2yzpB4,286766,290766,and I am going to verify as a student. I am going to say 
qqd-e2yzpB4,290766,294766,"""cuz teach told me so"" and you will see that"
qqd-e2yzpB4,294766,298766,the school's name and the primary field of study has been carried over
qqd-e2yzpB4,298766,302766,from the professor account. So they need not worry about
qqd-e2yzpB4,302766,306766,"filling that out. If your school is not listed, feel free to say"
qqd-e2yzpB4,306766,310766,"""school not listed"" and write in your school. My expected graduation date"
qqd-e2yzpB4,310766,314766,"lets say, as a student, I am going to graduate in 2026"
qqd-e2yzpB4,314766,318766,I agree to those terms and hit submit. Then I will be brought back to 
qqd-e2yzpB4,318766,322766,"the team and you will see that as a student, the first team on my account"
qqd-e2yzpB4,322766,326766,"is going to be the team that the professor, that you, "
qqd-e2yzpB4,326766,330766,"invited me to. So I have access to this team, and I can now collaborate"
qqd-e2yzpB4,330766,334766,"on this team. So as the professor, so here I am"
qqd-e2yzpB4,334766,338766,"in my Professor mode, I can create new"
qqd-e2yzpB4,338766,342766,"projects. So I could call this ""lessons"""
qqd-e2yzpB4,342766,346766,"I can create that project, and in this project, I can create"
qqd-e2yzpB4,346766,350766,new files. So I am going to go ahead and type in Figma.com/community
qqd-e2yzpB4,350766,354766,"and as part of the community, I am going to type in "
qqd-e2yzpB4,354766,358766,"lets say "" classroom activity"""
qqd-e2yzpB4,358766,362766,and I have here a couple of different examples. So lets say
qqd-e2yzpB4,362766,366766,I have this classroom brainstorming activity. and I like
qqd-e2yzpB4,366766,370766,"that template, I am going to go ahead and duplicate that so now"
qqd-e2yzpB4,370766,374766,"this template, I am going to put it in that classroom"
qqd-e2yzpB4,374766,378931,"so here I can move it to a project, and lets say I am going to move it"
qqd-e2yzpB4,378933,382766,to lessons. So this has now been moved
qqd-e2yzpB4,382766,386199,to my lessons and if I go back
qqd-e2yzpB4,386200,390200,"lets go back to my Figma files, you will see here that"
qqd-e2yzpB4,390200,392966,i have this folder so
qqd-e2yzpB4,392966,394099,when I go
qqd-e2yzpB4,394100,398100,"inside here, I can go into the share"
qqd-e2yzpB4,398100,402100,and I can see who has access
qqd-e2yzpB4,402100,406100,"anyone with the link can view, but everyone inside UX 101"
qqd-e2yzpB4,406100,407566,can access this file
qqd-e2yzpB4,407566,409532,As a student
qqd-e2yzpB4,409533,413533,"I can go into that lessons folder, and I can see that space"
qqd-e2yzpB4,413533,417533,"I can see that the professor is already in there, I can see that file"
qqd-e2yzpB4,417533,421533,"and I am good to go, so I am able to hop right into this file"
qqd-e2yzpB4,421533,425533,"and collaborate with my teacher, and I can even wave to them"
qqd-e2yzpB4,425533,429533,"So I am going to hold down the ""H"" key and wave to the professor. How cool is that?"
