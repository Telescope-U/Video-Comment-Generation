9mElopuX6JM,80,1680,this rail strike is one of the uk's
9mElopuX6JM,1680,4720,largest for years and it's being led by
9mElopuX6JM,4720,5920,one union
9mElopuX6JM,5920,8160,every worker in this country deserves to
9mElopuX6JM,8160,10559,negotiate a pay rise and bargain on
9mElopuX6JM,10559,12559,their conditions because if you're not
9mElopuX6JM,12559,14719,bargaining for a strong trade union
9mElopuX6JM,14719,17520,you're begging the rmt is bargaining on
9mElopuX6JM,17520,19439,behalf of thousands of workers they're
9mElopuX6JM,19439,20960,employed by the companies that operate
9mElopuX6JM,20960,22880,the trains and by network rail which
9mElopuX6JM,22880,25519,maintains the infrastructure and the rmt
9mElopuX6JM,25519,28560,says it's time for a pay rise it wants
9mElopuX6JM,28560,30240,to be clear this isn't about train
9mElopuX6JM,30240,31840,drivers most of them belong to a
9mElopuX6JM,31840,34000,different union this it says is for
9mElopuX6JM,34000,36399,signalers cleaners and many others
9mElopuX6JM,36399,38640,members who are not high earners for
9mElopuX6JM,38640,40879,example train guards own between 23 and
9mElopuX6JM,40879,43680,36 000 pounds track maintenance workers
9mElopuX6JM,43680,46800,between 16 and 34 000. to put that in
9mElopuX6JM,46800,49039,context the median pay for all employees
9mElopuX6JM,49039,52160,in the uk was close to 26 000 pounds
9mElopuX6JM,52160,55360,last year and the rmt says its members
9mElopuX6JM,55360,56800,deserve more
9mElopuX6JM,56800,58480,our members haven't had a pay rise for
9mElopuX6JM,58480,61120,up to three years so inflation is now
9mElopuX6JM,61120,62719,11.1
9mElopuX6JM,62719,65119,on the rpi scale there's two years ahead
9mElopuX6JM,65119,66960,of that where they've not had a pay deal
9mElopuX6JM,66960,69040,they are getting poorer
9mElopuX6JM,69040,71439,we should add in may 2019 the rmt did
9mElopuX6JM,71439,73280,secure a paid deal for some of its
9mElopuX6JM,73280,76400,members as for inflation it is high but
9mElopuX6JM,76400,78720,boris johnson says that's a reason to
9mElopuX6JM,78720,82240,show restraint if wages continually
9mElopuX6JM,82240,85360,chase the increase in prices then we
9mElopuX6JM,85360,88720,risk a wage price spiral
9mElopuX6JM,88720,90880,the fd defines a wage spiral is when
9mElopuX6JM,90880,93119,workers demand pay rises to match higher
9mElopuX6JM,93119,95119,living costs and then companies raise
9mElopuX6JM,95119,96799,prices to protect their margins to
9mElopuX6JM,96799,99439,protect their profits the ft says it
9mElopuX6JM,99439,102399,repeats a self-fulfilling process
9mElopuX6JM,102399,104640,unions counted this idea arguing that
9mElopuX6JM,104640,106960,energy prices are pushing up inflation
9mElopuX6JM,106960,110159,not wages now that analysis is disputed
9mElopuX6JM,110159,112159,but the government accepts that wages in
9mElopuX6JM,112159,114560,this case should rise
9mElopuX6JM,114560,116799,no one is suggesting there's some kind
9mElopuX6JM,116799,119119,of pay freeze required here we all want
9mElopuX6JM,119119,121680,to see a sensible pay increase
9mElopuX6JM,121680,122960,but of course there are different
9mElopuX6JM,122960,125280,definitions of sensible this is simon
9mElopuX6JM,125280,126719,clark's
9mElopuX6JM,126719,128319,link to that we need to see reformers
9mElopuX6JM,128319,129599,some of the practices that make our
9mElopuX6JM,129599,132400,railway a very unsustainable entity at
9mElopuX6JM,132400,134800,the moment we have to recognize that uh
9mElopuX6JM,134800,136879,the way that our rail network operates
9mElopuX6JM,136879,139760,is not fit for the 2020s
9mElopuX6JM,139760,142319,now pay proposals have been made the rmt
9mElopuX6JM,142319,144800,wants a seven percent rise network rail
9mElopuX6JM,144800,146879,is offered two percent with a further
9mElopuX6JM,146879,149360,one percent to come the rmt rejected
9mElopuX6JM,149360,150640,that though it accepts that
9mElopuX6JM,150640,153120,restructuring is necessary it adds we've
9mElopuX6JM,153120,154720,got to have an assurance that the people
9mElopuX6JM,154720,156560,who are working there today won't come
9mElopuX6JM,156560,159680,out of that worse off than they went in
9mElopuX6JM,159680,162000,and while the union wants assurances so
9mElopuX6JM,162000,164959,too do the train operating companies
9mElopuX6JM,164959,168239,we really require details and acceptance
9mElopuX6JM,168239,170800,that reform can go ahead and then that
9mElopuX6JM,170800,172640,allows us to then work on how do we get
9mElopuX6JM,172640,174959,a settlement for their staff
9mElopuX6JM,174959,177200,the company saves some reform have to be
9mElopuX6JM,177200,179680,accepted before an offer is made but the
9mElopuX6JM,179680,182080,rmt has a further concern
9mElopuX6JM,182080,183680,they have a plan
9mElopuX6JM,183680,185519,to cut thousands of jobs off the railway
9mElopuX6JM,185519,187440,network between network rail and train
9mElopuX6JM,187440,189519,operators we think that that threatens
9mElopuX6JM,189519,191120,the safety regimes
9mElopuX6JM,191120,192800,on our railway because they have to cut
9mElopuX6JM,192800,195120,the maintenance regimes in order to cut
9mElopuX6JM,195120,196239,the jobs
9mElopuX6JM,196239,198239,these safety concerns though are not
9mElopuX6JM,198239,200480,accepted by the employers
9mElopuX6JM,200480,202319,we do need to reduce the number of
9mElopuX6JM,202319,204239,people that work for network rail
9mElopuX6JM,204239,205760,because that's one of the key ways that
9mElopuX6JM,205760,207840,we can be more efficient and save money
9mElopuX6JM,207840,210080,we know we can do that safely
9mElopuX6JM,210080,211599,and so we have a government demanding
9mElopuX6JM,211599,213599,reduced budgets and modernization
9mElopuX6JM,213599,215519,employers seeking to deliver that and
9mElopuX6JM,215519,217760,union saying this is neither safe nor
9mElopuX6JM,217760,221040,fair and the context is the pandemic
9mElopuX6JM,221040,224000,we committed 16 billion pounds to
9mElopuX6JM,224000,227440,support the railways through covid as a
9mElopuX6JM,227440,229840,result the trains continued to operate
9mElopuX6JM,229840,232959,the industry survived not a single
9mElopuX6JM,232959,235599,railway worker had to be furloughed or
9mElopuX6JM,235599,237760,lost their job not one
9mElopuX6JM,237760,239280,it's true the government did support the
9mElopuX6JM,239280,240959,railways through the pandemic the
9mElopuX6JM,240959,243040,question is what should happen now
9mElopuX6JM,243040,244560,especially because covert has changed
9mElopuX6JM,244560,246640,how we travel passenger numbers are down
9mElopuX6JM,246640,248640,by a fifth in part because of working
9mElopuX6JM,248640,250959,from home fewer journeys mean lower
9mElopuX6JM,250959,252879,revenue especially on commuter routes
9mElopuX6JM,252879,254480,like this one and this is the
9mElopuX6JM,254480,256079,government's plan
9mElopuX6JM,256079,258880,modernize the railways make it more
9mElopuX6JM,258880,260959,productive and get the industry of
9mElopuX6JM,260959,263759,taxpayer funded life support
9mElopuX6JM,263759,265840,which the rmt argues that covets become
9mElopuX6JM,265840,267600,a smoke screen for job cuts that were
9mElopuX6JM,267600,269759,planned all along and though the rmt and
9mElopuX6JM,269759,271199,the government are trading statements in
9mElopuX6JM,271199,273120,public they're not actually directly
9mElopuX6JM,273120,275520,negotiating the union is talking to the
9mElopuX6JM,275520,277919,employers though it says in reality the
9mElopuX6JM,277919,280400,treasury in particular is calling the
9mElopuX6JM,280400,283040,shots and the opposition labour party
9mElopuX6JM,283040,284240,says this
9mElopuX6JM,284240,286160,not only are they boycotting the talks
9mElopuX6JM,286160,288000,they're actually hobbling them and
9mElopuX6JM,288000,290560,therefore that's why it is imperative
9mElopuX6JM,290560,292160,that they step in
9mElopuX6JM,292160,294080,the government denies a boycott but it
9mElopuX6JM,294080,296880,is declining to intervene it's not not
9mElopuX6JM,296880,298479,the case that we're going to sit around
9mElopuX6JM,298479,300000,the table directly with the trade unions
9mElopuX6JM,300000,302000,because that's not how uh the government
9mElopuX6JM,302000,303680,ought to be behaving here we're not the
9mElopuX6JM,303680,306479,legal employer to labour's leader though
9mElopuX6JM,306479,308800,this is a political ploy
9mElopuX6JM,308800,311360,i don't want the strikes to go ahead but
9mElopuX6JM,311360,313600,he does
9mElopuX6JM,313600,315199,he wants
9mElopuX6JM,315199,317280,mr speaker
9mElopuX6JM,317280,320960,he wants the country to grind to a halt
9mElopuX6JM,320960,323759,so he can feed off the division
9mElopuX6JM,323759,325919,the government denies this too and there
9mElopuX6JM,325919,328800,are also questions for labor
9mElopuX6JM,328800,330479,which party in this dispute are you
9mElopuX6JM,330479,331680,backing
9mElopuX6JM,331680,334000,well we're backing a deal we want to see
9mElopuX6JM,334000,337039,the dispute avoided and it can be
9mElopuX6JM,337039,338400,my colleague nick edley's looked at
9mElopuX6JM,338400,340720,labour too is it backing the striking
9mElopuX6JM,340720,342960,rail workers nick ass there's been no
9mElopuX6JM,342960,345759,definite answer how much is a fair pay
9mElopuX6JM,345759,348479,rise he asks that's for the negotiations
9mElopuX6JM,348479,351120,the party says and in these negotiations
9mElopuX6JM,351120,352720,there are profound tests for the
9mElopuX6JM,352720,354400,government and its stated commitment to
9mElopuX6JM,354400,356639,a high-wage economy for labour and its
9mElopuX6JM,356639,358560,relationship with the unions for the
9mElopuX6JM,358560,360160,rail employers and their efforts to run
9mElopuX6JM,360160,362319,a business with changing travel habits
9mElopuX6JM,362319,364319,and for the union and the leverage it
9mElopuX6JM,364319,366639,has to serve its members
9mElopuX6JM,366639,371160,something is going to have to give
9mElopuX6JM,388080,390159,you
