RVTGJqzXY-0,2711200,2719000,whoa  and how it gets power is from the wind
RVTGJqzXY-0,2720640,2726480,and then it blows on the sail and then  it goes whoa

RVTGJqzXY-0,2769440,2775200,whoa  hey and what are these down here
RVTGJqzXY-0,2775200,2782560,this is called a keel  it keeps  the boat really stable in the water so
RVTGJqzXY-0,2782560,2788000,then when the wind blows a sail it  doesn't fall over
RVTGJqzXY-0,2788000,2802400,sailboats and boats in general look like  so much fun  [Music]

RVTGJqzXY-0,2864079,2868559,okay  take it off the hanger
RVTGJqzXY-0,2869680,2875040,all right  so this is a life jacket
RVTGJqzXY-0,2876559,2884000,whoa  and life jackets are really useful when  you're near and on the water in boats
RVTGJqzXY-0,2884000,2890880,because they keep you afloat if you're  in the water so then you don't have to  go
RVTGJqzXY-0,2891839,2897280,and sometimes if the water is really  cold  you might wear
RVTGJqzXY-0,2897280,2903920,a wetsuit  oh look at them back here  see  it's like their feet
RVTGJqzXY-0,2903920,2911280,and then the arms  and i think these are actually called  dry suits because they actually keep you
RVTGJqzXY-0,2911280,2917839,dry so then the water doesn't touch you  oh let's see what else is around here
RVTGJqzXY-0,2917839,2923599,whoa  wow  yeah
RVTGJqzXY-0,2923599,2930000,the paddles or the kayak  whoa  [Applause]

RVTGJqzXY-0,2944200,2959119,[Music]
RVTGJqzXY-0,2959119,2964400,this building is so big  have you ever wondered where boats get
RVTGJqzXY-0,2964400,2971838,stored so then they can go inside away  from the weather like the rain
RVTGJqzXY-0,2971920,2978000,the wind  and the ice
