LcOLH14m3pU,12160,20080,conservatives standing in for the prime  minister  i think that in the end angela rainer  likely to go uh on a couple of things
LcOLH14m3pU,20080,26400,labor preferring in these exchanges  always to start off with cost of living  questions to make sure that they don't
LcOLH14m3pU,26400,32640,face accusations that they're just  focusing uh on as the conservatives have  had it petty uh personal politics around
LcOLH14m3pU,32640,39520,the the prime minister but there's no  way that angela rainer uh won't dig into  tory uh woes as the session goes on
LcOLH14m3pU,39520,44800,there's a lot of turbulence in politics  at the moment uh don't forget this will  be the first prime minister's question
LcOLH14m3pU,44800,51360,since the double by-election defeat for  the conservatives last thursday  if you remember uh they lost the
LcOLH14m3pU,51360,57760,tiverton hollington by-election that  went to the liberal democrats huge  majority of the tories overturned by the
LcOLH14m3pU,57760,64559,libtems richard ford there they also  lost the wakefield by-election uh to the  labour party it's like narrower uh win
LcOLH14m3pU,64559,70799,for labour there but nevertheless two  bad results that would put people like  theresa villa's seat very much in doubt
LcOLH14m3pU,70799,76159,if there's anything like those kinds of  swings  at a general election uh it has uh
LcOLH14m3pU,76159,81280,caused a bit more jitters in the  conservative party um but they've been  so there's been so much else on the
LcOLH14m3pU,81280,86960,agenda there haven't been moments where  that's really been reflected in  parliament or elsewhere  some of the things that have been sort
LcOLH14m3pU,86960,92720,of dominating uh mp's lives this week  include the northern ireland protocol  bill that attempt to roll back parts of
LcOLH14m3pU,92720,98720,the um brexit deal that boris johnson  agreed uh to uh remove some of those  checks on goods going from great britain
LcOLH14m3pU,98720,105360,to northern ireland that's upset many uh  in the eu  you've had the issue of strikes  dominating still over the weekend that's
LcOLH14m3pU,105360,110799,caused some difficulty uh for labor  what's their position on whether or not  they'd match in or offer

LcOLH14m3pU,134959,141200,questions uh but in the end i suspect  that angela reynolds will want to take  dicks of the prime minister dominic rob

LcOLH14m3pU,307440,314639,[Music]  but instead of showing some humility  intends to limp on until the 2030s
LcOLH14m3pU,314639,320400,so does he think the cabinet will prop  him up for this long

LcOLH14m3pU,376560,381759,not to be the leader of the opposition  but to be the prime minister of this
LcOLH14m3pU,381759,388560,country and to be honest mr speaker it  couldn't come quick enough britain can't
LcOLH14m3pU,388560,393840,stop it this prime minister for another  eight years his own benches can't
LcOLH14m3pU,393840,401280,stomach him for another eight minutes  and if they continue to prop him up mr  speaker i doubt the voters will stomach
LcOLH14m3pU,401280,407440,him for even eight seconds in the ballot  box  now let's imagine mr speaker the prime
LcOLH14m3pU,407440,414000,minister is still clinging on into the  2030s under this tax high low growth
LcOLH14m3pU,414000,421440,tory government at this rate by 2030 the  british public will have endured 55 tax

LcOLH14m3pU,614160,620240,right honourable lady wants to help  working people they should be clear in  standing up against these militant

LcOLH14m3pU,1119919,1125120,think and he referred to some of the  challenges in scotland but i think  actually the people of scotland want
LcOLH14m3pU,1125120,1131360,their two governments to work together  and we are  keen willing enthusiastic to do so
LcOLH14m3pU,1131360,1136880,ian blackfoot there is no case for the  union as we've just heard from the  deputy prime minister because
LcOLH14m3pU,1136880,1142080,mr speaker the harsh reality is that the  tories might fear democratic debate but
LcOLH14m3pU,1142080,1147919,they don't have the right to block  scottish democracy  as the
LcOLH14m3pU,1147919,1153280,late  cannon kenyon wright said  what if the other voice we all know so

LcOLH14m3pU,1182720,1188320,agree with him and so do the scottish  people scottish democracy will not be a
LcOLH14m3pU,1188320,1194640,prisoner of any prime minister in this  place  so why is the uk government scared of
LcOLH14m3pU,1194640,1200080,democracy or is it simply is it simply  that they have run out of ideas to
LcOLH14m3pU,1200080,1205280,defend the failing westminster system  deputy prime minister i thank the
LcOLH14m3pU,1205280,1210559,honourable gentleman i think he's rather  airbrushing history with uh that long  soliloquy but look he wrench mentioned

LcOLH14m3pU,1228080,1233520,europe the highest since records began i  think the people of scotland expect  their government in hollywood and in
LcOLH14m3pU,1233520,1238720,westminster to work together to tackle  the issues facing them in their  day-to-day lives
LcOLH14m3pU,1238720,1246120,peter alders  thank you very much mr deputy speaker  there are great opportunities

LcOLH14m3pU,1266080,1271840,the challenge of providing local people  with the necessary skills however they
LcOLH14m3pU,1271840,1278080,and other colleges are finding it  increasingly difficult to recruit and  retain teachers in such work as
LcOLH14m3pU,1278080,1283600,fabrication engineering and construction  will my right honourable friend ensure
LcOLH14m3pU,1283600,1289760,that the government come up with a  cross-departmental strategy to address  this staffing crisis in our further
LcOLH14m3pU,1289760,1297279,education colleges which could undermine  the leveling up agenda obviously  deputies there come on
LcOLH14m3pU,1297600,1303760,my underworld friend is absolutely right  and that's why we're investing nearly 52  million pounds to support the sector
LcOLH14m3pU,1303760,1309360,recruiting and retaining excellent staff  and in particular looking and focusing  on the experience and the skills that we
LcOLH14m3pU,1309360,1315039,can often find in industry to train the  next generation of technical experts
LcOLH14m3pU,1315039,1320799,thank you mr speaker no country that  values its independence and indeed its  self-respect could agree to a treaty
LcOLH14m3pU,1320799,1325919,which signed away its economic  independence and self-government  ultimately membership of any union that
LcOLH14m3pU,1325919,1331679,involves pooling of sovereignty can only  be sustained with the consent of the  people does the deputy prime minister
LcOLH14m3pU,1331679,1337120,agree with the prime minister and his  predecessor yes or no yeah
LcOLH14m3pU,1337120,1343120,deputy prime minister i just say to  donald trump that's why we had the  referendum in uh a few years ago the
LcOLH14m3pU,1343120,1349919,people of scotland spoken and  and we think it's not the right time to  be relitigating this issue

LcOLH14m3pU,1369679,1375919,having to wait a further two months  until the application window closes  with taxation
LcOLH14m3pU,1375919,1382720,at a 40-year high  when will the government be bolder in  cutting taxes given all the evidence the

LcOLH14m3pU,1387760,1393600,standards and better enables the  government to help the less fortunate  even if such a policy means cutting
LcOLH14m3pU,1393600,1399280,spending such as hs2  [Applause]  my honourable friend makes an important
LcOLH14m3pU,1399280,1406000,point about driving growth in the  economy and that's why  we're uh cutting taxes with the 130
LcOLH14m3pU,1406000,1411840,super deduction for capital investment  that will not just create good jobs but  well-paid jobs and better paid jobs by
LcOLH14m3pU,1411840,1418080,boosting productivity that's why we're  increasing the employment allowance  which represents a tax cut of a thousand
LcOLH14m3pU,1418080,1423200,pound for half a million small  businesses that's why we've provided  business rate relief of seven billion
LcOLH14m3pU,1423200,1428960,over the next five years and of course  we're cutting national insurance just  next month worth 330 pounds for a
LcOLH14m3pU,1428960,1436400,typical employee  patricia gibbs thank you mr speaker as  torrey msp myrtle fraser points out
LcOLH14m3pU,1436400,1442400,scotland has a third of britain's  landmass half its territorial waters  over 60
LcOLH14m3pU,1442400,1449200,of uk fishing zones 98 of oil reserves  63 of natural gas a quarter of europe's
LcOLH14m3pU,1449200,1454400,offshore wind resources and 90 percent  of the uk's fresh water
LcOLH14m3pU,1454400,1460720,can the deputy prime minister explain  if his opposition to scottish  independence is because he fears the
LcOLH14m3pU,1460720,1467279,loss of these invaluable resources  she's absolutely right in what she just
LcOLH14m3pU,1467279,1473360,said there are huge assets right across  scotland and that's why we think we're  stronger together in delivering and
LcOLH14m3pU,1473360,1480320,delivering for the people of scotland  oliver hill yeah  mr speaker
LcOLH14m3pU,1480880,1487440,the deputy prime minister will be aware  that in northeast hertfordshire we have  some of the best farmland in the country
LcOLH14m3pU,1487440,1493200,and at a time when there are concerns  about uh food production food security
LcOLH14m3pU,1493200,1499200,at a time when the government is  considering rural land use  isn't it time to ensure that our
LcOLH14m3pU,1499200,1504559,productive farmland isn't covered in  solar plants and that they are that they
LcOLH14m3pU,1504559,1510950,are positioned rather on brownfield  sites on buildings and on low-grade  agriculture
LcOLH14m3pU,1510950,1517919,[Applause]  i think he he makes a powerful point and  our 2023 land use framework will set out
LcOLH14m3pU,1517919,1524400,our priorities for land use across the  country and he's right that we've got to  protect uh the most versatile
LcOLH14m3pU,1524400,1530960,agricultural land and any plans a plans  for ground-mounted solar installations  will have to take that very point into
LcOLH14m3pU,1530960,1538559,account his point is well made rosie  duffy  so far this year 52 women have been
LcOLH14m3pU,1538559,1545039,killed in the uk  our rights to free speech safe spaces  fairness in sport and even the words we
LcOLH14m3pU,1545039,1551360,use to describe our own bodies are all  under threat will the deputy prime  minister send a clear signal as some of
LcOLH14m3pU,1551360,1557679,his cabinet colleagues have done this  week that britain respects the rights of  women and will he accept the cross-party
LcOLH14m3pU,1557679,1563600,amendment to his forthcoming bill of  rights which enshrines a woman's right  to choose in law
LcOLH14m3pU,1563600,1568640,deputy prime minister can i thank the  honourable lady um for a question can i  also just say at the outset what huge
LcOLH14m3pU,1568640,1574320,respect i personally have for her with  the way she stood up for women's rights
LcOLH14m3pU,1575440,1580960,and frankly the appalling harassment  trolling and bullying that she's faced
LcOLH14m3pU,1580960,1587919,the position as she knows is settled in  uk law in relation to abortion it's  decided by honourable members uh across
LcOLH14m3pU,1587919,1593840,this house it's an issue of conscience i  don't think there is a strong case for  change what i wouldn't want to do uh is
LcOLH14m3pU,1593840,1600720,find ourselves with a greater respect in  the u.s position where this is being uh  litigated through the courts rather than  settled as it is now settled uh by
LcOLH14m3pU,1600720,1606000,honorable members in this house well  thank you mr speaker
LcOLH14m3pU,1607440,1613039,in february 2019 the  this house uh passed my excellent civil
LcOLH14m3pU,1613039,1618720,partnerships marriages and deaths  etc act mandating government to extend
LcOLH14m3pU,1618720,1624080,civil partnerships to opposite sex  couples enabling marriage records to  include mother's details and requiring
LcOLH14m3pU,1624080,1630080,the justice secretary to produce a  report empowering coroners to  investigate stillbirths the first two
LcOLH14m3pU,1630080,1636000,have come into force very successfully  but two and a half years on despite  further shocking revelations about
LcOLH14m3pU,1636000,1642480,deaths of babies at several hospitals no  report has yet been published nor  regulations to give coroners the powers
LcOLH14m3pU,1642480,1648240,they need why not  minister can i thank my honourable  friend he's absolutely right to raise
LcOLH14m3pU,1648240,1654960,this and of course stillbirth is an  appalling tragedy which has the most  devastating impact on families across
LcOLH14m3pU,1654960,1660000,the country he's right the moj the dhsc  have jointly consulted on proposals to
LcOLH14m3pU,1660000,1665840,provide coroners with new powers in this  regard i have looked at this personally  we will be publishing the government's
LcOLH14m3pU,1665840,1671600,response to the consultation very  shortly  illumina  thank you mr speaker
LcOLH14m3pU,1671600,1677440,threatened  terrified  alone  this was how survivors of sexual
LcOLH14m3pU,1677440,1685039,violence told me they felt when they  were pressured into signing  non-disclosure agreements and gagging  clauses by their universities
LcOLH14m3pU,1685039,1691600,no victim of sexual assault or  harassment should ever be coerced into  silence by the very institutions who are
LcOLH14m3pU,1691600,1697200,meant to protect them not at university  not at work  not anywhere
LcOLH14m3pU,1697200,1702240,so will the government back my bill to  ban the use of ndas in cases of sexual
LcOLH14m3pU,1702240,1708000,harassment bullying and misconduct and  will the deputy prime minister consider  meeting with me in his role as justice
LcOLH14m3pU,1708000,1713200,secretary to discuss how we'll put a  stop to this deplorable practice once
LcOLH14m3pU,1713200,1718240,and for all  every prime minister can i just say  honorable lady i'll look very carefully
LcOLH14m3pU,1718240,1723600,at  any particular proposal she has we've  got to do everything we can to protect
LcOLH14m3pU,1723600,1730080,women and girls in this country and also  frankly to make them feel more confident  in the justice system that's why i'm
LcOLH14m3pU,1730080,1736080,relieved but rest to go further but  relieved that the volume of rape  convictions in the last year alone is up
LcOLH14m3pU,1736080,1743520,by two-thirds  and of course in the police courts  sensing a crime act in force this week
LcOLH14m3pU,1743520,1749760,we have taken extra measures for example  by extending the time limit for  reporting domestic abuse and also
LcOLH14m3pU,1749760,1755840,criminalizing uh taking photos of a  of a mother breastfeeding without  consent and i'll certainly look at the
LcOLH14m3pU,1755840,1761840,proposals that she's raised with me  daniel  thank you mr speaker
LcOLH14m3pU,1761840,1768080,we are investing nearly 190 billion  pounds this year into the nhs and yet
LcOLH14m3pU,1768080,1774480,many of us  see disturbing deficiencies within nhs  management no more so than in the
LcOLH14m3pU,1774480,1779600,shrewsbury and telford nhs trust  four years ago in 2018 my right
LcOLH14m3pU,1779600,1785520,honourable friend the member for ludlow  and i secured 312 million pounds for a
LcOLH14m3pU,1785520,1793120,major amd modernization within our local  hospital trust  four years on construction has still not
LcOLH14m3pU,1793120,1800080,started what message can the deputy  prime minister give to the people of  shrewsbury as to how government can
LcOLH14m3pU,1800080,1805120,intervene to break this gridlock and  finally allow the 312 million pounds we
LcOLH14m3pU,1805120,1812159,have secured to be utilized for the  benefits of the people of shropshire and  mid wales
LcOLH14m3pU,1812399,1818799,my honourable friend is a doubting  champion of his constituents  particularly on nhs services the dhsc
LcOLH14m3pU,1818799,1825039,recently received the strategic outline  case uh for the transformation of any  services in truespin telford it's still
LcOLH14m3pU,1825039,1832080,being processed but i can tell him that  the trust is aiming to present the full  business case in 2023 with construction
LcOLH14m3pU,1832080,1837080,starting in the same year there's  several robots
LcOLH14m3pU,1839200,1844559,when he announced his bill of rights  last week  the deputy prime minister said it will
LcOLH14m3pU,1844559,1849760,strengthen our uk  tradition of freedom
LcOLH14m3pU,1849760,1854799,freedom  shameless from a government whose  condemned for the rule of law and
LcOLH14m3pU,1854799,1859840,evolution can be judged in equal measure  they're scrapping welsh law against our
LcOLH14m3pU,1859840,1865360,will denying scotland the right to  choose their own future that isn't  freedom
LcOLH14m3pU,1865360,1870840,will he will he prove me wrong will he  prove me wrong  by enshrining
LcOLH14m3pU,1870840,1876880,self-determination in his bill of rights  [Music]  can i thank the honourable lady i
LcOLH14m3pU,1876880,1883679,thought it's very deaf the way she got  that in i think we've all heard actually  across  the benches today the case for
LcOLH14m3pU,1883679,1888880,reinforcing free speech uh whether it's  the judge made privacy laws or some of  the
LcOLH14m3pU,1888880,1895200,way people are shouted down when they  express legitimate opinions and i also  think that the people of wales want to  join with us as a true across the
LcOLH14m3pU,1895200,1900320,country making sure we can deport more  foreign national offenders that is the  reality for the people in wales and
LcOLH14m3pU,1900320,1905679,across the united kingdom and i think  the bill of rights will be strengthening  our tradition of freedom but also
LcOLH14m3pU,1905679,1911840,curbing those abuses and making sure we  inject a bit more common sense into the  system
LcOLH14m3pU,1913279,1920559,thank you mr speaker derriford hospital  then my constituency is part of the new  hospital build program announced by this

LcOLH14m3pU,1925840,1931679,the amazing staff there and the  brilliant chief executive and james who  works so hard but given the incredible
LcOLH14m3pU,1931679,1937919,pressures on the real estate in  development would my original friend  consider prioritizing capital investment
LcOLH14m3pU,1937919,1943679,into that part of the uk to ensure that  we can accelerate these plans  particularly in digital so that people
LcOLH14m3pU,1943679,1949360,in health in plymouth get the  world-class healthcare they deserve  thank you honourable friend look he's

LcOLH14m3pU,1978399,1985200,thank you mr speaker the victims of  black cab rapist john warboys were only  able to challenge the police's failures
LcOLH14m3pU,1985200,1991760,to investigate its appalling crimes  because of the human rights act  they would not have been able to do so
LcOLH14m3pU,1991760,1997919,under the deputy prime minister's new  so-called bill of rights  why does he want to stop women like the
LcOLH14m3pU,1997919,2004240,victims of john warboys from making sure  the police protect them from rape and  sexual assault and getting the justice
LcOLH14m3pU,2004240,2010080,they deserve  can i thank your honourable lady for the  opportunity that it was not the result
LcOLH14m3pU,2010080,2015120,of litigation uh that uh addressed the  problems with the warboy case and indeed
LcOLH14m3pU,2015120,2021519,uh if she wants to look after victims in  cases like that and others the labour  party should join with us not just in
LcOLH14m3pU,2021519,2026640,supporting the bill of rights but our  parole reforms that will make sure  dangerous offenders are not released and
LcOLH14m3pU,2026640,2032799,we protect the public  david  thank you mr speaker

LcOLH14m3pU,2044399,2049520,and despite repeated judgments in his  favor in the courts in poland
LcOLH14m3pU,2049520,2056000,he's been unable to persuade the polish  authorities to fulfill their obligations  under international law
LcOLH14m3pU,2056000,2061200,and return  those children to their family well my  right honourable friend intercede and
LcOLH14m3pU,2061200,2067679,ensure that my constituent and the many  other families who face this challenge  are able to ensure that their children

LcOLH14m3pU,2074240,2080960,imagine how appalling that situation  must be for any parent uh to find  themselves in he'll know we're committed
LcOLH14m3pU,2080960,2086000,to the uh 1980 hay convention on child  abduction and that does provide a
