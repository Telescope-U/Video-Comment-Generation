f8OIYzV5Npo,2868,5840,Come to to Venice if you possibly can.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,5840,9680,Hi i'm Nana Oforiatta Ayim i'm the  curator of the Ghana pavilion.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,14000,18480,Arriving in Venice is like entering  a magical theatre. One that puts on a  
f8OIYzV5Npo,18480,25599,"show every two years on a stage so spectacular,  that no other art fair could possibly match it.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,26240,31200,The Venice biennale is called the olympics  of the art world. It can be a gruelling 
f8OIYzV5Npo,31200,37920,"and overwhelming experience, with 213  artists from 58 countries taking part,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,37920,42480,"as well as countless extra events.  But it is an art lover's paradise,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,43040,57840,and throughout its six months duration the city of  Venice comes alive. This is the original biennale. 
f8OIYzV5Npo,71200,78880,Welcome to the 59th Venice biennale  the Venice biennale is the oldest biennale in  
f8OIYzV5Npo,78880,85840,"the world. The Venice biennale takes place in  two main venues: The Giardini and the Arsenale,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,86800,93440,"as well as hundreds of off-site exhibitions and  events. During his short time in Venice, Napoleon  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,93440,100800,"built the Venice Giardini, the public gardens. Later  29 permanent national pavilions were constructed  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,101360,107280,in which each country has exhibited  their art every other year since 1895.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,108640,113920,This year's biennale curated by Cecilia  Alemani features a majority of female  
f8OIYzV5Npo,113920,121600,"artists for the first time 90% in fact, meaning  the 59th biennale will go down in history.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,121600,127840,"The show's title ""The Milk of Dreams"" is a  reference to the artist Leonora Carrington.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,128560,135840,"Politics naturally also featured this year. Great  Art Cities Explained was in Venice for the opening,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,135840,141840,and we have chosen our favorites from hundreds  of exhibitions featuring thousands of artists.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,145920,150319,Simone Leigh has transformed the US  pavilion from a building reminiscent  
f8OIYzV5Npo,150320,156640,"of Thomas Jefferson's plantation, into an  african palace. In front is a sculpture  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,156640,163200,"suggesting a D'mba, a headdress worn by the Baga  people of the Guinea coast for ceremonial purposes.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,163200,168239,"The head, a satellite dish, broadcasts  Leigh's ideas to the Biennale crowds.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,168960,175520,The physical act of making sculpture is important  to Leigh. Her work cast in bronze and ceramic  
f8OIYzV5Npo,175520,181680,"represents the labour of black women, both physical  and intellectual - often written out of history.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,182480,189040,"The first black woman to represent the US at the  Biennale, Simone Leigh's work is powerful, ambitious  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,189040,196719,"and explores history, race, colonialism and gender.  Francis Alys has been looking at human behaviour  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,196720,203440,through the medium of children's games for over 20  years. It is an open-ended tribute to Pieter Bruegel.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,204000,209440,"For the biennale he has produced a joyous  multi-screen piece, of street children at play  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,209440,214800,"in their own environment and following their own  rules of play. The work, called ""The Nature of the  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,214800,220960,"Game"" reflects his concerns with geopolitics. The  films were shot in Hong Kong. The Democratic Republic  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,220960,228400,"of Congo, India, Belgium and Mexico. They remind us  that even in the ruins of poverty and war, play  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,228400,232560,is something that we learn instinctively  and where we can find joy and hope.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,233520,237920,If you like experimental rock music  then this is the exhibition for you.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,237920,243680,"The artist is performing a live concert that  will last 200 days straight, eight hours a day.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,243680,249439,The images on the screen are triggered by the  live music. Fusinato tells us that the point of  
f8OIYzV5Npo,249440,254800,"this ongoing cacophonous wall of sound feedback,  is to remind the audience that ""they are alive""."
f8OIYzV5Npo,256880,262720,This pavilion is not for the faint-hearted. One of  the most disturbing experiences of the biennale.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,262720,268480,The pavilion has been transformed into a hyper  realistic trans-human world that blends idyllic  
f8OIYzV5Npo,268480,274640,Danish farm life with strange science-fiction  elements. A family of centaurs made of silicon and  
f8OIYzV5Npo,274640,281840,"taxidermy, including this female giving birth, is  one of the more unsettling exhibits in the gardens.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,282400,286960,Zineb Sedira is the first person of  Algerian descent to represent France.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,287520,292080,Cinema has been a lifelong obsession for  the artist and this installation features  
f8OIYzV5Npo,292080,299840,a series of studio interiors on a sound stage - all  about cinema - Sedira screens her own recreated or  
f8OIYzV5Npo,299840,306720,reimagined films based on films that were made in  the 1960s and 70s that depict Algeria's struggle  
f8OIYzV5Npo,306720,313920,for liberation. The show is punctuated with live  tango performances on a recreated 1960s film set 
f8OIYzV5Npo,320240,323840, 
f8OIYzV5Npo,354215,361699,"Japan's entry is a Kyoto artist collective who say the  work highlights ""the theme of today's post-truth society"". "
f8OIYzV5Npo,362189,367520,"I'm Jonathas de Andrade, and this is  the Brazilian pavilion. We are here in front of the  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,368599,375034,"the sculpture of the piece which gives the  title of the show which is ""Com o coração saindo pela boca"" -"
f8OIYzV5Npo,375034,382240,"'With the heart coming out of the mouth"". This is  one of the 250 expressions based on the body.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,382240,388880,From these expressions there are photographs  sculptures and a video installation.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,388880,394320,"So we the the audience, the visitors, are invited to  enter through one ear and leave out of the other. "
f8OIYzV5Npo,394320,400720,"They are allegories of Brazil and the world,  and most of them have political connotations.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,402640,407600,The Sámi people are the only indigenous people  of the European Union and are one of the oldest  
f8OIYzV5Npo,407600,415440,"living cultures. They live in four countries: Norway,  Sweden, Finland, and Russia. The Nordic pavilion has  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,415440,421920,been transformed into the Sámi pavilion showing  three indigenous artists who highlight the Sámi 
f8OIYzV5Npo,421920,435840,"struggle against the Norwegian state, including  these works made of reindeer sinews and wax."
f8OIYzV5Npo,438720,443520,The pavilion celebrates the art and sovereignty  of the indigenous Sámi people who have been  
f8OIYzV5Npo,443520,448729,"subjected to well-documented  discrimination, abuse and mistreatment."
f8OIYzV5Npo,448730,455200,"Another groundbreaker at this Biennale is Sonia Boyce,  as the first black woman to represent Great Britain.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,455200,460320,The installation explores the human voice  as an instrument for freedom and imagination.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,461120,467680,She has five black female singers on screen  in separate rooms improvising in a kind of jam  
f8OIYzV5Npo,467680,472960,session. As their voices drift through the  galleries they sometimes blend in together  
f8OIYzV5Npo,472960,478800,"and sometimes they clash. Finally in the central  hall installation, we see their meeting at the  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,478800,484960,"Abbey road studios, where they met and improvised  together for the first time. The work is about  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,484960,491120,"collaboration and the art of listening. As Boyce  said: ""The performances were born out of a simple  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,491120,499776,"question: As a woman, as a black person what does  freedom feel like? How do you imagine freedom?"
f8OIYzV5Npo,507040,512400,The Russian artists and their curator pulled out  of representing Russia at the Venice Biennale  
f8OIYzV5Npo,512400,519039,as they disagree with the invasion of Ukraine.  Various protests and performers have been taking  
f8OIYzV5Npo,519039,526720,place outside the pavilion. Nearby a temporary  Ukraine pavilion was only planned two weeks ago!  
f8OIYzV5Npo,526720,532800,"It symbolises strength and resilience. A wooden  pavilion burned to strengthen the wood, and a  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,532800,538959,stack of sandbags (similar to those used to  protect historical monuments in Ukrainian cities).  
f8OIYzV5Npo,543600,548959,"The second main exhibition space is Arsenale,  which in the middle ages was the leading shipyard  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,548960,554560,of the world. Today the former shipyards are a  huge exhibition space where we find national  
f8OIYzV5Npo,554560,559483,representation for those countries who don't  have a permanent space in the gardens. 
f8OIYzV5Npo,559684,566240,"Simone  Leigh shows in both the Giardini and the Arsenale,  and the first thing to hit you is her 16-foot tall, "
f8OIYzV5Npo,566240,575839,bronze bust of a black woman with a torso that  combines the forms of a skirt and a clay house.
f8OIYzV5Npo,578080,582616,Here in no particular order are the  highlights of the Arsenale. 
f8OIYzV5Npo,582990,589373,Caravaggio's masterpiece can be found  in Malta where he once lived. The painting inspired three Maltese artists 
f8OIYzV5Npo,589373,597040,"to create this fantastic  kinetic, sculptural installation that uses  ""Induction technology"" to melt steel, producing  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,597040,603199,molten droplets that then fall into seven basins  of water - each representing a part of Caravaggio's  
f8OIYzV5Npo,603200,609680,"painting. After hitting the water, the bright  orange embers hiss, cool and recede into darkness."
f8OIYzV5Npo,612400,616480,"Some works get lost, due to the  sheer volume of art available.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,616480,621839,This quiet site-specific installation  surrounds the spectators en-route through  
f8OIYzV5Npo,621840,627600,"the galleries, and is a sensory mix of  soil, clay, cinnamon, tobacco, and charcoal.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,628720,634240,"In a biennale with many disturbing exhibits,  this got our vote for the most disturbing!  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,634240,641040,"The subject of this dark, dark film: A man who  murders his family, is made even more disturbing  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,641040,648079,by its aesthetic. What looks like a stop-action  animated film is in fact actors in prosthetics.
f8OIYzV5Npo,651120,657600,"Hi my name is Na Chainkua Reindorf, and i am  one of the artists representing Ghana.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,657600,664720,"I'm really interested in storytelling. I  basically created a mythology of seven characters,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,664720,670000,and the sculpture you see behind me is  a physical representation of one of the  
f8OIYzV5Npo,670000,674880,characters. Which is the blue painting over  there - and then this particular character  
f8OIYzV5Npo,674880,680560,"is based on this idea of a woman who is in  total control over her body and her sexuality,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,680560,687840,and also in control over who has  access to her body and her sexuality.
f8OIYzV5Npo,704720,711120,"Mire Lee makes kinetic sculptures with low-tech  motors, plastic hoses and machinery that resemble  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,711120,718480,internal organs. But instead of blood they are  pumping liquid clay. We are big fans of Emma  
f8OIYzV5Npo,718480,724959,"Talbot who works with her personal thoughts and  emotions, to produce a wider universal narrative, so  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,724960,730240,we were pleased that she is showing her beautiful  hand-painted texts and patterns at the biennale.
f8OIYzV5Npo,741040,747199,"Pavlo Makov's work was conceived a long time  before Russia invaded Ukraine, but has NOW taken  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,747200,750903,on new meaning. We spoke to one of the curators.   
f8OIYzV5Npo,751365,759467,"This project - this idea of ""exhaustion"" was not  anymore only about Ukraine, about the local context. "
f8OIYzV5Npo,759467,767440,"But it really become relevant for the global context. So the project was referring  to the idea of exhaustion of  ecology,"
f8OIYzV5Npo,767440,774800,of economics of politics. Social connections  after the pandemic of Covid-19 of course. 
f8OIYzV5Npo,774800,778720,"And now, after the the war in Ukraine started,  and after our country was brutally  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,778720,784959,"invaded by Russian troops, it has become the symbol  of ""Exhaustion of humanity"" and it's not  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,784960,789440,"only relevant for Ukraine but it's relevant  for global society, because unfortunately this  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,789440,796320,"brutal war is not only about our country but it's  against the civilised societies, against any  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,796960,805852,"human civilised relationship, and so this project has become  double relevant and even more important right now. "
f8OIYzV5Npo,806685,811154,"Makov: ""If you don't have culture  there is no nation - there is no country"""
f8OIYzV5Npo,812320,819200,"The off-site shows during the biennale are in  churches, palazzos, theatres. cinemas, shops - even  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,819200,826560,the islands around Venice. The influential American  collector's home and museum on the grand canal  
f8OIYzV5Npo,826560,832960,is a must-see on any Venice art itinerary. One of  the themes of the biennale is surrealism and  
f8OIYzV5Npo,832960,836720,the Guggenheim is well placed to  put on a great show on that theme.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,837520,845920,"The new show ""Surrealism and Magic"" has around 60  works by artists like Leonora Carrington, Max Ernst,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,845920,853920,"René Magritte, Dorothea Tanning and others. One of  our favorite shows was Marlene Dumas. Her haunting  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,853920,859680,"paintings and stunning watercolour portraits  shown here, confront the grand themes of life.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,859680,865040,A truly great painter who has radically  expanded the vocabulary of painting.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,866080,871920,Kahinde Wiley is best known as the artist who  painted President Obama's official portrait.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,871920,877360,"For this new body of work Wiley has created  a haunting series of prone black bodies,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,877360,883545,reconceptualizing classical pictorial forms  to create a contemporary take on historic art.
f8OIYzV5Npo,883717,891604,"These powerful monumental works reverberate  with violence, pain and death as well as ecstasy. "
f8OIYzV5Npo,915341,921018,"Wiley: ""So what i want to do is go in there and  really play to the strengths of what art CAN do."

f8OIYzV5Npo,994720,1000319,"The last time we saw Wallace Chan's work  was in Canary Wharf, London. For Venice he has  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1000320,1007120,deconstructed his monumental sculpture and viewers  are invited to walk through the darkened palazzo  
f8OIYzV5Npo,1007120,1013360,"and physically connect with the fragments.  Material, Space and Time are his concerns,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1013360,1019760,"and Chan works with Titanium, a material once  considered too complex for large works, but  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1019760,1026880,here is seen on a gigantic scale. The combination  of monumentality and close human interaction make  
f8OIYzV5Npo,1026880,1035520,"us aware, of not just space but our place within it.  For me, part of the appeal of the Venice biennale  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1035520,1040800,is seeing modern works in ancient buildings.  And our next two artists demonstrate that.

f8OIYzV5Npo,1303252,1311142,"affect us directly. All of us, particularly in this  moment in history, know that war is a terrible issue"
f8OIYzV5Npo,1311142,1315249," for many many people in the world,  and these paintings explain that. "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1315680,1322000,"Some of these works we see in Venice are enormous, and  weigh tons so how on earth do they transport them  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1322000,1329760,"with no roads? We spoke to Gisela Winkelhoffer, the  curator who arranged to transport four enormous  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1329760,1336720,Julian Opie sculptures - each weighing a quarter of  a ton - and then place them on a terrace 100 feet  
f8OIYzV5Npo,1336720,1343280,"above water level. ""So - the four sculptures,  the so-called ""Venice Runners"" came from the UK  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1343280,1351360,"to Venice. I was asked by the transport  company: ""Can the truck go directly to the hotel?"",  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1351360,1358480,"and I said:""Of course not! Venice is on the water!""  So finally we had to discuss all the logistic steps.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1358480,1367440,It was going first from the UK to Maghera  to unload with the crane all the four big  
f8OIYzV5Npo,1367440,1375039,sculptures in the crates on a huge transport  boat. And then slowly it took another one hour  
f8OIYzV5Npo,1375040,1381920,"to deliver it on a huge pontoon boat and crane,  in front of the balustrade of the Saint Regis.  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1382560,1390640,"Finally they arrived and then we needed a huge  crane to get them to a height of 33 meters,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1390640,1395600,on the middle terrace of Saint Regis.  It was logistic-wise really a masterpiece.  
f8OIYzV5Npo,1396640,1402480,"Historically important as a major trading port,  Renaissance Venice had the economy and the will  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1402480,1410799,"to support artists, and it did so in a big way.  Now with around 320 biennales around the world  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1410800,1416720,"it is hard to imagine that one of them has more  power than any other, but the Venice biennale  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1416720,1423280,"matters, because it is one of the few places that  the art world visits en masse. Part of the appeal  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1423280,1430160,"of the biennale is a combination of the beautiful  1600 year old city of Venice itself, the historical  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1430160,1436000,"importance of it, and the art world pulling  out all the stops!. There is so much art here  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1436000,1441440,"that you can't possibly like all of it. Sometimes  you are left scratching your head in disbelief,  "
f8OIYzV5Npo,1442160,1457840,but sometimes there are flashes of genius  so brilliant that you'll NEVER forget it.
