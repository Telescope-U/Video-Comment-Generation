xEv0Ua3FIBA,102640,104960,tanks for sponsoring this video this is
xEv0Ua3FIBA,104960,107360,actually a 2011 so it's a double stack
xEv0Ua3FIBA,107360,109600,1911 but it's been modified with a short
xEv0Ua3FIBA,109600,111360,stroke kit so basically limiting the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,111360,113200,movement of the slide increasing the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,113200,117118,fire rate to a crazy crazy amount
xEv0Ua3FIBA,120880,124960,the springfield m14 child of an m1 grand
xEv0Ua3FIBA,124960,126960,it has realistic
xEv0Ua3FIBA,126960,128560,action so you can actually see the bolt
xEv0Ua3FIBA,128560,130399,rotating back and forth the bolt
xEv0Ua3FIBA,130399,133200,actually rotates in and out of battery
xEv0Ua3FIBA,133200,135360,just like the real one picks up a round
xEv0Ua3FIBA,135360,138800,every time that you pull the trigger
xEv0Ua3FIBA,139200,142840,let's give it a shot
xEv0Ua3FIBA,146720,148160,still works
xEv0Ua3FIBA,148160,150400,so this is a buried 50 cal originally
xEv0Ua3FIBA,150400,152640,this was an aeg so an electric gun but
xEv0Ua3FIBA,152640,154640,i've stripped out the complete inside so
xEv0Ua3FIBA,154640,157120,it's now much much more powerful powered
xEv0Ua3FIBA,157120,160640,by this gas tank here on my back it's
xEv0Ua3FIBA,160640,162560,got a recoil stock inside so every time
xEv0Ua3FIBA,162560,164800,that i pull the trigger it will actually
xEv0Ua3FIBA,164800,169640,recoil backwards pop in a mag
xEv0Ua3FIBA,170560,173680,we can shoot it
xEv0Ua3FIBA,180879,183280,desert eagle full metal so it's a heavy
xEv0Ua3FIBA,183280,186239,boy desert eagle has a nice kick because
xEv0Ua3FIBA,186239,188560,there's a huge you know mass of metal
xEv0Ua3FIBA,188560,192760,moving back and forth anyway
xEv0Ua3FIBA,199760,201280,so cool but there's a huge mass going
xEv0Ua3FIBA,201280,202879,back and forth just feels really good
xEv0Ua3FIBA,202879,204720,we're gonna try to put some tracers on
xEv0Ua3FIBA,204720,206400,the the minigun now i actually actually
xEv0Ua3FIBA,206400,208239,have not tried this yet
xEv0Ua3FIBA,208239,210480,there we go
xEv0Ua3FIBA,210480,212319,all right
xEv0Ua3FIBA,212319,214239,can you see him here
xEv0Ua3FIBA,214239,217120,ready ready
xEv0Ua3FIBA,217660,221440,[Laughter]
xEv0Ua3FIBA,221440,225799,it's pretty dark it's pretty dark
xEv0Ua3FIBA,227410,227860,[Applause]
xEv0Ua3FIBA,227860,230720,[Laughter]
xEv0Ua3FIBA,230720,232799,well that's fun
xEv0Ua3FIBA,232799,234799,i think it's a little misaligned i think
xEv0Ua3FIBA,234799,236000,some of them might be a little
xEv0Ua3FIBA,236000,237760,misaligned and it's causing like you can
xEv0Ua3FIBA,237760,239439,see a lot of bb hits on this one again
xEv0Ua3FIBA,239439,241280,that's a proof of concept you could put
xEv0Ua3FIBA,241280,244720,a bunch of tracers on a minigun
xEv0Ua3FIBA,245920,249920,so this is the rpg 7. this is a gas
xEv0Ua3FIBA,249920,252159,powered rpg so it actually shoots out
xEv0Ua3FIBA,252159,254560,the whole projectile the the rocket that
xEv0Ua3FIBA,254560,257199,it comes with that is fires has a co2
xEv0Ua3FIBA,257199,259680,cartridge inside the nose cone fires out
xEv0Ua3FIBA,259680,261919,and basically hits surface like this and
xEv0Ua3FIBA,261919,267560,it'll fire the co2 inside the nose cone
xEv0Ua3FIBA,275400,276960,m16a1
xEv0Ua3FIBA,276960,278800,with an m203
xEv0Ua3FIBA,278800,280400,grenade launcher underneath it you guys
xEv0Ua3FIBA,280400,283040,have seen the m16 before uh it had the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,283040,285360,the handguards of an m16a1 so the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,285360,287600,triangular handguards on it gas blowback
xEv0Ua3FIBA,287600,289680,of course so when you pull it down here
xEv0Ua3FIBA,289680,291919,the ball goes back and forth
xEv0Ua3FIBA,291919,293199,and uh
xEv0Ua3FIBA,293199,294880,let's give it a go all right so we're
xEv0Ua3FIBA,294880,298160,gonna pop in a mag and then
xEv0Ua3FIBA,298160,300720,try some
xEv0Ua3FIBA,307120,309759,comes with the jams of vietnam
xEv0Ua3FIBA,309759,311840,but of course we got to try
xEv0Ua3FIBA,311840,314720,the grenade launcher as well
xEv0Ua3FIBA,314720,316080,all right so we've got a shell it's
xEv0Ua3FIBA,316080,317120,already leaking a little bit so we're
xEv0Ua3FIBA,317120,319280,going to just quickly pop that bad boy
xEv0Ua3FIBA,319280,320240,in
xEv0Ua3FIBA,320240,323280,close it up and then
xEv0Ua3FIBA,323600,325680,ah come on
xEv0Ua3FIBA,325680,327199,okay so the shell might be leaking a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,327199,329039,little bit anyway
xEv0Ua3FIBA,329039,330639,maybe let's just try one more time let's
xEv0Ua3FIBA,330639,331919,try one more time
xEv0Ua3FIBA,331919,333680,okay quick just
xEv0Ua3FIBA,333680,337199,sneaky as [ __ ] okay pop it in
xEv0Ua3FIBA,337199,339759,okay close it it's not popping
xEv0Ua3FIBA,339759,342540,okay there we go
xEv0Ua3FIBA,342540,344639,[Applause]
xEv0Ua3FIBA,344639,346240,yeah i might have done that a little uh
xEv0Ua3FIBA,346240,347919,too often
xEv0Ua3FIBA,347919,348960,all right you probably already
xEv0Ua3FIBA,348960,352000,recognized this this is a svd it's a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,352000,353600,heavy boy
xEv0Ua3FIBA,353600,356080,it's full wood full steel
xEv0Ua3FIBA,356080,356800,and
xEv0Ua3FIBA,356800,359440,has a pso scope on the top here which is
xEv0Ua3FIBA,359440,361600,not the most ergonomic scope in my
xEv0Ua3FIBA,361600,364960,opinion i have not shot this for a while
xEv0Ua3FIBA,364960,367120,there we go
xEv0Ua3FIBA,367120,368400,drop the bolt
xEv0Ua3FIBA,368400,370080,let's give it a go oh my god this
xEv0Ua3FIBA,370080,372880,[ __ ] scope is terrible so you have to
xEv0Ua3FIBA,372880,374400,actually put this thing almost up to
xEv0Ua3FIBA,374400,377680,your face but difficult to uh to aim oh
xEv0Ua3FIBA,377680,379360,my god it's really hard to like get to
xEv0Ua3FIBA,379360,382240,get your eye in there
xEv0Ua3FIBA,384400,386720,okay that's cool that's pretty cool this
xEv0Ua3FIBA,386720,389039,is my mp5 it's about sweat airsoft this
xEv0Ua3FIBA,389039,390800,thing is powered by propane i'm gonna
xEv0Ua3FIBA,390800,393440,stick in a magazine of course the mp5
xEv0Ua3FIBA,393440,394880,slap is
xEv0Ua3FIBA,394880,398250,included and now it's ready to fire
xEv0Ua3FIBA,398250,401399,[Music]
xEv0Ua3FIBA,403600,405840,sawed off double barrelled shotgun takes
xEv0Ua3FIBA,405840,407919,these shotgun shells so these like 12
xEv0Ua3FIBA,407919,409759,gauge i guess shell so what you would
xEv0Ua3FIBA,409759,410639,call them
xEv0Ua3FIBA,410639,413199,um and basically you have
xEv0Ua3FIBA,413199,415039,well you can first slap it shut and then
xEv0Ua3FIBA,415039,418000,you have two triggers down here for each
xEv0Ua3FIBA,418000,419440,barrel independently you know it's
xEv0Ua3FIBA,419440,421280,pretty easy to like pop somebody around
xEv0Ua3FIBA,421280,422400,the corner or somebody's like in a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,422400,423599,window
xEv0Ua3FIBA,423599,425199,shoot him like that
xEv0Ua3FIBA,425199,427440,attack 41 probably going to be my main
xEv0Ua3FIBA,427440,429520,rifle for for a while i'm going back and
xEv0Ua3FIBA,429520,432400,forth between rifles i've got a massive
xEv0Ua3FIBA,432400,434240,massive suppressor on the end of here
xEv0Ua3FIBA,434240,436160,dampens the sound quite a bit really
xEv0Ua3FIBA,436160,437120,smooth
xEv0Ua3FIBA,437120,439360,nice bolt pool with a nice big bolt
xEv0Ua3FIBA,439360,440639,handle here that has got like a little
xEv0Ua3FIBA,440639,443680,twist to it looks really cool an overall
xEv0Ua3FIBA,443680,446240,smooth operating
xEv0Ua3FIBA,446240,449199,rifle this is a striker 12. this thing
xEv0Ua3FIBA,449199,451520,is powered by these little shotgun
xEv0Ua3FIBA,451520,453280,shells they're filled with gas on the on
xEv0Ua3FIBA,453280,455599,the bottom so propane three rounds each
xEv0Ua3FIBA,455599,457520,in each shell then you open the little
xEv0Ua3FIBA,457520,459520,door here on the back
xEv0Ua3FIBA,459520,461759,and you shove in the shell
xEv0Ua3FIBA,461759,463440,and then you have to like twist the drum
xEv0Ua3FIBA,463440,465840,so the next opening will show itself
xEv0Ua3FIBA,465840,467680,final one and you can close it holds i
xEv0Ua3FIBA,467680,470240,think 12 rounds if i'm not mistaken so
xEv0Ua3FIBA,470240,472160,it takes a lot of time to actually
xEv0Ua3FIBA,472160,474400,reload it but uh yeah let's give it a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,474400,477400,shot
xEv0Ua3FIBA,480240,483599,so this is the uh akm or ak-47 gas
xEv0Ua3FIBA,483599,486000,blowback as well so the realistic bolt
xEv0Ua3FIBA,486000,487520,every time it moves backwards it picks
xEv0Ua3FIBA,487520,489599,up another round into the chamber if you
xEv0Ua3FIBA,489599,491440,look at the insides here people might
xEv0Ua3FIBA,491440,493120,find this indistinguishable from the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,493120,495680,from the real thing but we've got a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,495680,497599,i guess i'll figure that out so i'm
xEv0Ua3FIBA,497599,498960,pretty sure
xEv0Ua3FIBA,498960,501919,it's not gonna work
xEv0Ua3FIBA,502639,504080,it does work
xEv0Ua3FIBA,504080,505599,all right cool
xEv0Ua3FIBA,505599,506879,actually it works pretty good i thought
xEv0Ua3FIBA,506879,508720,it just didn't work we just tried to
xEv0Ua3FIBA,508720,510000,shoot it right before we started
xEv0Ua3FIBA,510000,511120,shooting this just to make sure it
xEv0Ua3FIBA,511120,514159,worked it didn't work
xEv0Ua3FIBA,515360,517120,pretty cool i want to see some close-up
xEv0Ua3FIBA,517120,521000,of the bolt look at that thing
xEv0Ua3FIBA,521120,524080,now that's cool this is the car 98k it
xEv0Ua3FIBA,524080,526560,was a real car 98k that was used during
xEv0Ua3FIBA,526560,529200,the war world war ii and has been
xEv0Ua3FIBA,529200,531200,converted to an airsoft gun by matt
xEv0Ua3FIBA,531200,533440,fowler in england so he actually did all
xEv0Ua3FIBA,533440,535279,the custom work to make sure this thing
xEv0Ua3FIBA,535279,538240,takes sg parts so inside is an sg24 on
xEv0Ua3FIBA,538240,540880,the outside it's a legit car 98k it's
xEv0Ua3FIBA,540880,543120,even got the spicy you know
xEv0Ua3FIBA,543120,547680,markings yeah the spicy eagle let's say
xEv0Ua3FIBA,547680,550000,that shoots great mp40
xEv0Ua3FIBA,550000,551760,never actually shot this gun this is a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,551760,553440,co2 powered gun
xEv0Ua3FIBA,553440,555279,of course the guns my sweat airsoft like
xEv0Ua3FIBA,555279,557360,a lot of my other guns guess we just
xEv0Ua3FIBA,557360,559120,give it a go not sure this is fires from
xEv0Ua3FIBA,559120,562560,open bolt or not let's shoot in there
xEv0Ua3FIBA,562560,563920,okay
xEv0Ua3FIBA,563920,565360,whoa
xEv0Ua3FIBA,565360,567279,did the bb hit the camera
xEv0Ua3FIBA,567279,570160,only full auto
xEv0Ua3FIBA,571279,573760,oh this is good that's nice the armies
xEv0Ua3FIBA,573760,576839,are coming
xEv0Ua3FIBA,577440,579360,hans
xEv0Ua3FIBA,579360,581120,thompson sub machine gun last time you
xEv0Ua3FIBA,581120,582560,guys have seen this thing equipped with
xEv0Ua3FIBA,582560,585440,the drum mag this is an open bolt system
xEv0Ua3FIBA,585440,587680,so fires from an open bolt every time
xEv0Ua3FIBA,587680,589440,that you fire basically the bolt slams
xEv0Ua3FIBA,589440,591360,forward and fires around
xEv0Ua3FIBA,591360,592240,and
xEv0Ua3FIBA,592240,594480,yeah
xEv0Ua3FIBA,597360,599680,and now it's on full auto let's see how
xEv0Ua3FIBA,599680,603640,it runs in full auto
xEv0Ua3FIBA,604399,606000,yeah pretty good
xEv0Ua3FIBA,606000,607200,still pretty good because you could use
xEv0Ua3FIBA,607200,609200,some a little bit of loop but um
xEv0Ua3FIBA,609200,612640,this is the ssp45 carbine kit it's got a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,612640,614320,pistol inside so this is a high kappa
xEv0Ua3FIBA,614320,616399,pistol turns it into a little submachine
xEv0Ua3FIBA,616399,617839,gun it's got a bolt handle now so
xEv0Ua3FIBA,617839,619839,basically you do like you cycle it like
xEv0Ua3FIBA,619839,622079,that
xEv0Ua3FIBA,625120,627440,of course it's got the full auto as well
xEv0Ua3FIBA,627440,631240,which is a lot more fun
xEv0Ua3FIBA,636560,638480,this is the double barrel 12 gauge
xEv0Ua3FIBA,638480,641040,shotgun it's got a real walnut stuck and
xEv0Ua3FIBA,641040,645120,on the inside it shoots these big ass
xEv0Ua3FIBA,645120,646560,12 12-gauge shell i think it's a bit
xEv0Ua3FIBA,646560,648240,longer than a 12-gauge shell two
xEv0Ua3FIBA,648240,650720,triggers down here one for each barrel
xEv0Ua3FIBA,650720,652959,one trigger has broken off already a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,652959,654880,little bit i mean as well all my guns
xEv0Ua3FIBA,654880,656160,are a little bit you know well loved
xEv0Ua3FIBA,656160,658839,well well used but uh it is what it
xEv0Ua3FIBA,658839,662399,is there we go
xEv0Ua3FIBA,664399,666720,glock 18c
xEv0Ua3FIBA,666720,668880,really fun gun of course it's got the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,668880,671360,fun switch so this is semi-auto this is
xEv0Ua3FIBA,671360,672640,full auto
xEv0Ua3FIBA,672640,675360,pop in a mag
xEv0Ua3FIBA,679120,680720,it's getting a little bit low on gas
xEv0Ua3FIBA,680720,683200,this is a mosin nagant as you might want
xEv0Ua3FIBA,683200,685200,to call it but it's actually a finnish
xEv0Ua3FIBA,685200,687279,variant of the mohs and the guns trench
xEv0Ua3FIBA,687279,689680,airsoft to um replicate the rifle the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,689680,691279,rifle of seymour haya which is the most
xEv0Ua3FIBA,691279,694160,accomplished sniper in his career he had
xEv0Ua3FIBA,694160,696320,over 500 confirmed kills during the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,696320,698079,finish in russian war and this is what
xEv0Ua3FIBA,698079,700160,he used so as you can see there's no
xEv0Ua3FIBA,700160,702320,scope on it seemo never used the scope
xEv0Ua3FIBA,702320,704399,because his scope would have a glint
xEv0Ua3FIBA,704399,706720,from the sun reflecting off his front
xEv0Ua3FIBA,706720,708560,scope glass and basically giving his
xEv0Ua3FIBA,708560,710399,position away so he would often never
xEv0Ua3FIBA,710399,712320,use a scope instead and just rely on the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,712320,714480,pure iron sides of his gun which are
xEv0Ua3FIBA,714480,716880,also a little bit different to a normal
xEv0Ua3FIBA,716880,719279,mode and a gun it kind of looks like the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,719279,721920,two little ears sticking out but it is a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,721920,725839,really smooth operating
xEv0Ua3FIBA,725839,728079,rifle this is a winchester it's a golden
xEv0Ua3FIBA,728079,730959,winchester the cowboy gun cowboy boy
xEv0Ua3FIBA,730959,732639,it shoots these cartridges so every time
xEv0Ua3FIBA,732639,735200,you pull the lever actually pulls in
xEv0Ua3FIBA,735200,736720,pulls in the bullet let me just pull up
xEv0Ua3FIBA,736720,738079,here so these little bullets is the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,738079,739519,thing that it shoots you pretend you
xEv0Ua3FIBA,739519,741519,pull the lever it actually pulls in a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,741519,742320,new
xEv0Ua3FIBA,742320,744720,cartridge and puts it inside the chamber
xEv0Ua3FIBA,744720,745760,i'm not sure if it actually kind of
xEv0Ua3FIBA,745760,748639,shoots though we'll see
xEv0Ua3FIBA,752240,754959,we got a jam
xEv0Ua3FIBA,755680,758920,i think grantee
xEv0Ua3FIBA,758959,761120,so this is my main sidearm right now
xEv0Ua3FIBA,761120,764320,this is the tokyo marui high kappa gold
xEv0Ua3FIBA,764320,766560,match so the gold match that not only
xEv0Ua3FIBA,766560,769200,looks like a you know fancy
xEv0Ua3FIBA,769200,770800,but it also makes it shoot a lot better
xEv0Ua3FIBA,770800,772560,this is the the upgraded version of the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,772560,776959,the token murray high kappa so accurate
xEv0Ua3FIBA,777519,779040,i literally just shot that twig that i
xEv0Ua3FIBA,779040,780959,was aiming at there with a pistol which
xEv0Ua3FIBA,780959,783440,is crazy going back in time this is my
xEv0Ua3FIBA,783440,784839,original
xEv0Ua3FIBA,784839,787680,sg24 this one has been in the majority
xEv0Ua3FIBA,787680,789519,of my videos still shoots really really
xEv0Ua3FIBA,789519,792399,well you can see like it's so smooth to
xEv0Ua3FIBA,792399,794320,uh pull the bolt
xEv0Ua3FIBA,794320,796320,and hit something long range still
xEv0Ua3FIBA,796320,798000,really amazing gun it's part of my
xEv0Ua3FIBA,798000,800000,channel i owe a lot to this this gun
xEv0Ua3FIBA,800000,802720,here my baby which i dropped in the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,802720,805759,mud right over there
xEv0Ua3FIBA,806399,809040,revolver and it shoots these cartridges
xEv0Ua3FIBA,809040,810639,so it actually takes you know bullet
xEv0Ua3FIBA,810639,813279,shapes so you shove the little rounds in
xEv0Ua3FIBA,813279,816160,there one by one you close it
xEv0Ua3FIBA,816160,818160,like that and now
xEv0Ua3FIBA,818160,822319,pull the hammer and it's ready to fire
xEv0Ua3FIBA,822800,824240,if you guys have played counter-strike
xEv0Ua3FIBA,824240,825839,you'll probably recognize this gun this
xEv0Ua3FIBA,825839,829839,is the l96 pop one
xEv0Ua3FIBA,832720,835279,the a12 is one of my few guns that are
xEv0Ua3FIBA,835279,836720,actually powered by
xEv0Ua3FIBA,836720,838560,a battery so it's electric but this
xEv0Ua3FIBA,838560,841279,thing is just too cool to ignore has
xEv0Ua3FIBA,841279,843760,three barrels so a full auto shotgun
xEv0Ua3FIBA,843760,845040,this whole
xEv0Ua3FIBA,845040,847279,drum mag here two three kilograms of
xEv0Ua3FIBA,847279,848240,ammo
xEv0Ua3FIBA,848240,851720,within one drum
xEv0Ua3FIBA,858560,862320,ssx 23c carbine kit turns the pistol
xEv0Ua3FIBA,862320,865360,into a dmr so you shove it inside here
xEv0Ua3FIBA,865360,867680,it has the the ability to mount the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,867680,869920,stock that adds the ability to add a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,869920,871760,scope on it which you couldn't do on the
xEv0Ua3FIBA,871760,874160,original pistol so it turns this little
xEv0Ua3FIBA,874160,876240,super silent pistol into an absolute
xEv0Ua3FIBA,876240,879600,beast pretty reliable
xEv0Ua3FIBA,880399,883360,my ssg 10 quite a unique sg10 it's quite
xEv0Ua3FIBA,883360,885120,a lot of things have been changed on it
xEv0Ua3FIBA,885120,887279,changed the stock out for my own design
xEv0Ua3FIBA,887279,888639,and
xEv0Ua3FIBA,888639,891519,yeah basically just
xEv0Ua3FIBA,892320,893920,shoots how you need it to every time so
xEv0Ua3FIBA,893920,895440,right now i'm gonna go with attack 41
xEv0Ua3FIBA,895440,897519,and this one is gonna go on back on my
xEv0Ua3FIBA,897519,898480,wall
xEv0Ua3FIBA,898480,901600,for now remington 870 this is a propane
xEv0Ua3FIBA,901600,903680,powered shotgun obviously you could do
xEv0Ua3FIBA,903680,905600,this
xEv0Ua3FIBA,905600,906880,but it is cool i don't know why that
xEv0Ua3FIBA,906880,910399,door keeps opening ruger 1022 choose a
xEv0Ua3FIBA,910399,913199,22 long rifle so it's got this little
xEv0Ua3FIBA,913199,915440,itty bitty bolt that goes back and forth
xEv0Ua3FIBA,915440,916330,but that's how they are
