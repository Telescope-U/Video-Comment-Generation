RICsNMN6Fb8,799,6480,there is one instinct you need to be  wary of  one that you must fight
RICsNMN6Fb8,6480,12320,this one is a liar  this one is a saboteur a backbiter
RICsNMN6Fb8,12320,19600,and  like the devil himself he's a  shape-shifter
RICsNMN6Fb8,19600,25439,this is the instinct that says you've  had enough  you've given it your best shot you can
RICsNMN6Fb8,25439,31720,stand down you can back off you can take  a knee
RICsNMN6Fb8,32719,38399,you can rest now  do  not listen
RICsNMN6Fb8,38399,46000,because that instinct is a liar and  wants to bring you down you see this  instinct is a defense mechanism for your
RICsNMN6Fb8,46000,51760,ego it gives you an out  a place to run to a place of sympathy
RICsNMN6Fb8,51760,59359,and amnesty where all can be forgiven  [Music]  failures gather together in comfort and
RICsNMN6Fb8,59359,65119,drown their sorrows in lies and  deception  they tell each other
RICsNMN6Fb8,65119,71680,and they tell you  that you did the best you could  and the deck was stacked against you and
RICsNMN6Fb8,71680,76720,it's not your fault  i hate
RICsNMN6Fb8,76720,83280,plan b  every thought that you put into plan b  you're taking away now that thought and
RICsNMN6Fb8,83280,88960,that energy from plan a i've never ever  had a plan b i made a full commitment
RICsNMN6Fb8,88960,94400,that i'm gonna go and be a bodybuilding  champion i made a full commitment that  i'm gonna be in america i made a full
RICsNMN6Fb8,94400,101280,commitment that i'm gonna get in the  show business and i'm going to be a  leading man no matter what it takes i  will do the work i will do the work over
RICsNMN6Fb8,101280,105680,and over and over until i get it
RICsNMN6Fb8,108320,114399,they print money they don't print time  they don't print opportunities you can  lose money and get it back you can't get
RICsNMN6Fb8,114399,122240,time back you can't get experiences back  worship getting your time back with your  family average people focus on money the
RICsNMN6Fb8,122240,128280,great focus on time because i can't get  my time back
RICsNMN6Fb8,128399,136239,you've got to develop a sense of urgency  aurelia said stop living your life like  you have a thousand years to live
RICsNMN6Fb8,136239,142080,in life you're either here today  and you're gone today  if there's something that you want to do
RICsNMN6Fb8,142080,148239,and you can't do it all at one time do  just a little bit of it i like what  robert schultz says he said by the yard
RICsNMN6Fb8,148239,153800,it's hard but inch by inch anything is  ascension
RICsNMN6Fb8,157760,165120,one of the most important lessons in  life  that you should know  is to remember to have an attitude
RICsNMN6Fb8,165120,171840,of gratitude  of humility  understand where the gift comes from
RICsNMN6Fb8,173200,181440,it's not  mine it's been given to me  use what i have use what you have
RICsNMN6Fb8,182159,189440,two  help others you know on your last day  you can't take it with you
RICsNMN6Fb8,189840,195040,but you can leave it here you'll never  see a u-haul behind a hearse
RICsNMN6Fb8,195040,200159,you don't have to work hard you don't  have to eat right you don't have to  sleep right you don't have to do more  than what's required of you you don't
RICsNMN6Fb8,200159,207040,have to do anything that you don't want  to do  you don't have to win you don't have to  be a success in life so the greatest
RICsNMN6Fb8,207040,212319,things in life is sacrifice and  discipline  that's why so few people achieve great
RICsNMN6Fb8,212319,217439,things because they don't want to  sacrifice they don't want to discipline
RICsNMN6Fb8,220000,226879,bring them to help yourself  both of them say  i've been working hard i'm all about
RICsNMN6Fb8,226879,232640,being your own hero  if i'm not about kissing your ass
RICsNMN6Fb8,232640,238159,in life a lot of us believe  that we're working much harder than we  actually are
RICsNMN6Fb8,238159,244799,we think if we got up early for four  days  we've earned something
RICsNMN6Fb8,244799,251120,the guy dropped your entitled mindset  is dead right  we believe you work harder than we
RICsNMN6Fb8,251120,257040,actually have  trust me  most of us have it  the one thing in life you gotta realize
RICsNMN6Fb8,257040,262160,is this  learn to help yourself  don't count other people
RICsNMN6Fb8,262160,269440,to help you  stay hard  force yourself to do it say you're the
RICsNMN6Fb8,269440,274639,general the brain is the general the  troops of the body the troops don't want  to listen but you go [ __ ] you you listen
RICsNMN6Fb8,274639,280400,and you get up and you do it just do it  make yourself do it and if you do that  if you write down and do that you can
RICsNMN6Fb8,280400,287280,change who the [ __ ] you are and so they  tell you  it's okay to stop
RICsNMN6Fb8,287280,292560,it's okay to settle  it's okay
RICsNMN6Fb8,292560,297600,to give up  and that is the instinct you need to
RICsNMN6Fb8,297600,303039,fight to push back to smash into the  ground
RICsNMN6Fb8,303039,308720,do not take the easy way out do not give  up based on instinct
RICsNMN6Fb8,308720,314160,if you are forced to stand down to  retreat so you can rebuild and re-attack
RICsNMN6Fb8,314160,319280,so be it  but make that decision based on logic
RICsNMN6Fb8,321039,326400,replace it with the instinct that says  get up  go
RICsNMN6Fb8,326400,332720,fight on  [Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,332720,339360,identity is the governor on every single  area of your life it literally sets the  temperature for all of the conditions of
RICsNMN6Fb8,339360,346240,your life because we know what we are  but not what we may be and the who you  may be is going to be dictated by your
RICsNMN6Fb8,346240,352560,ability to alter your identity because  you are going to always be consistent  with what you believe you're worth and
RICsNMN6Fb8,352560,358720,what you believe you deserve  we're going through whatever as if it
RICsNMN6Fb8,358720,363759,lasts forever and i want to say this yes  moments happen seasons happen but how we
RICsNMN6Fb8,363759,370160,respond to those things determines how  long those things last in our life  and so i want to just tell you this to
RICsNMN6Fb8,370160,375440,remind you of this  right the sun will shine
RICsNMN6Fb8,375440,381919,okay and the storms will come  i want you to understand that the sun  will shine
RICsNMN6Fb8,381919,389120,and the storms will come  everything a man does for himself
RICsNMN6Fb8,389120,394319,guess what  he takes with him but everything he does
RICsNMN6Fb8,394319,400800,for others  he leaves behind  so when you begin to say what is it that
RICsNMN6Fb8,400800,406400,i want to leave  what contribution that i want to begin  to make what difference do i want to
RICsNMN6Fb8,406400,413680,make in life what is it that i want to  do with the rest of the life that i have  left what what chances i need to take
RICsNMN6Fb8,413680,420319,what risks do i need to begin to embrace  you can either live your dreams or live
RICsNMN6Fb8,420319,426160,your fears  what are you willing to sacrifice in
RICsNMN6Fb8,426160,432560,order to move forward you have to give  up something that you love and you may  have to give up the thing you love the  best that's the fundamental sacrificial
RICsNMN6Fb8,432560,438560,motif  we all fall down in life guys the
RICsNMN6Fb8,438560,441919,question is who gets back up
RICsNMN6Fb8,446960,452960,do what is meaningful not what is  expedient because meaning is an instinct  meaning is the instinct that guides you
RICsNMN6Fb8,452960,459280,in life  across the totality of life right what's  expedient that's what you might want to
RICsNMN6Fb8,459280,465840,do right now in an impulsive sense right  because you're driven forward by oh  anger or anxiety or frustration or
RICsNMN6Fb8,465840,472319,disappointment or despair some sort of  one-eyed motivational monster that's got  you in its grip that really isn't
RICsNMN6Fb8,472319,478720,considering everything at once right  like considering your life tomorrow or  your life next week or maybe you're
RICsNMN6Fb8,478720,485039,maybe even your well-being half an hour  from now  and the instinct for meaning seems to be
RICsNMN6Fb8,485039,491440,a consequence of the integration of all  of those underlying motivations and  emotions with social being and then the
RICsNMN6Fb8,491440,497199,manifestation of something like the  proper pathway forward and you need that  because you need to know how to move
RICsNMN6Fb8,497199,503039,forward in life  there is always something you can do
RICsNMN6Fb8,503039,508879,differently  and once you understand that you can  always make a different choice and get a
RICsNMN6Fb8,508879,514800,different reaction and that's the power  in your life that's the power that you  have is no matter what's going on you
RICsNMN6Fb8,514800,521120,can choose to think differently believe  differently see  differently all of those things are a
RICsNMN6Fb8,521120,528000,choice read man's search for meaning by  victor frankl
RICsNMN6Fb8,528640,533959,that if you have a y you can survive  almost anyhow
RICsNMN6Fb8,534080,541120,i can't afford to quit  because i have a family depending on me  i got a word that depends on me
RICsNMN6Fb8,542240,548560,i understand what i'm fighting for do  you  what you fighting for
RICsNMN6Fb8,548560,555760,what you living for  what you're doing it for  for some retweets on twitter
RICsNMN6Fb8,557200,563279,are you doing it for something different  are you doing it for legacy because  regardless legacy is left
RICsNMN6Fb8,563279,568720,whether you want to leave it or not  either it's going to be left in a way  you don't want to leave it or it's going  to be left in the way you want to leave
RICsNMN6Fb8,568720,574880,it legacy is left regardless but you  right now have a chance  here's the problem i find most people
RICsNMN6Fb8,574880,580720,have they judge themselves to the lens  of a moment  they fail at something
RICsNMN6Fb8,580720,585760,they miss  the honor club  they don't close that deal they thought
RICsNMN6Fb8,585760,590800,they were going to they embarrass  themselves they flub something
RICsNMN6Fb8,590800,598640,and they think that defines who they are  [Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,598640,605839,but i'm telling you right now you're not  defined by who you are you're defined by  who you want to become
RICsNMN6Fb8,606160,613040,everything you're going through  is preparing you for what you ask god  for you just got to quit tripping while
RICsNMN6Fb8,613040,616519,you're in the process
RICsNMN6Fb8,618250,623600,[Music]  when you see people bear their suffering
RICsNMN6Fb8,623600,629920,nobly there's nothing in that  but good and then when you see people  take on more responsibility and decide
RICsNMN6Fb8,629920,635920,that they're going to aim up and  confront their suffering honestly and  forthrightly that their lives get better
RICsNMN6Fb8,635920,641920,and the lives of people around them get  better too and so it's that's very  strange as well because it also means
RICsNMN6Fb8,641920,647839,that the pathway to less suffering is  through suffering
RICsNMN6Fb8,648160,653440,it is the thing that allows you to go  the extra distance
RICsNMN6Fb8,653440,659040,to dig a little deeper to push a little  harder
RICsNMN6Fb8,659040,666560,to get after it  and it actually takes two opposing  forces to bring it to life it takes both
RICsNMN6Fb8,666560,672560,emotion and logic to reach your maximum  potential to really give everything you
RICsNMN6Fb8,672560,679360,have to go beyond your limits  the process is necessary you may not see
RICsNMN6Fb8,679360,685040,it now but when it gets you on the other  side of it you're going to see exactly  why it went that way and you're going to
RICsNMN6Fb8,685040,690380,be okay with it  adversity causes some cats to break and  other cats to break records

RICsNMN6Fb8,698560,706399,the most important step we'll ever take  in life  is our next one  the lava is gonna be stuck in concrete
RICsNMN6Fb8,706399,711760,we better be stuck in concrete because  we're afraid  because we're afraid
RICsNMN6Fb8,711760,720190,to make enemies  we're afraid as people's mind  [Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,723120,729320,one thing in life you can always have  haters  embrace them
RICsNMN6Fb8,731120,736399,learn one thing  shut the [ __ ] noise out  embrace the fact that people don't like
RICsNMN6Fb8,736399,740839,you it makes you do something right
RICsNMN6Fb8,749360,756399,because when you think it's the  beginning you behave differently than  the end the meaning we associate to  things controls our entire lives
RICsNMN6Fb8,756399,762480,it's not that your mother or father died  that's giving you suffering  certainly that's painful
RICsNMN6Fb8,762480,768560,it's the meaning you think it shouldn't  have happened  when we take control of the meaning it's  the only thing we can control our lives
RICsNMN6Fb8,768560,774720,we can't control events  when it just doesn't make any logical
RICsNMN6Fb8,774720,782399,sense to go on  that's when you use your emotion your  anger your frustration your fear to push
RICsNMN6Fb8,782399,788079,further to push you to say one thing i  don't
RICsNMN6Fb8,788079,793200,stop  nobody's going to believe in you
RICsNMN6Fb8,793200,798639,until you've already done it  nobody's going to come and celebrate  with you until you've already done it
RICsNMN6Fb8,798639,803560,the work is going to come before the  belief
RICsNMN6Fb8,809910,818949,[Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,827040,833519,when your feelings are screaming that  you have had enough when you think you  are going to break emotionally override
RICsNMN6Fb8,833519,840160,that emotion with concrete logic and  willpower that says one thing
RICsNMN6Fb8,840160,845600,fight  weak emotions with the power of logic
RICsNMN6Fb8,846079,852440,fight the weakness of logic with the  power of emotion
RICsNMN6Fb8,859040,864560,i  don't  [Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,864560,867560,stop
RICsNMN6Fb8,870079,876560,faith is the belief in things that you  cannot see  you can never lose faith
RICsNMN6Fb8,876560,882399,that's the key you have to believe in  something that you can't see you have to  believe when you can't when you don't
RICsNMN6Fb8,882399,889279,see no way how  you have to buckle down and keep  believing
RICsNMN6Fb8,890480,895760,we're having a biological experience  nature has those two levers pleasure and
RICsNMN6Fb8,895760,900800,pain  i think a lot of people make the mistake  of thinking well as long as i don't do
RICsNMN6Fb8,900800,907680,things that create a problem i don't do  bad things i'll be fine  what could possibly be wrong
RICsNMN6Fb8,907680,913120,with sitting around  in my apartment all day  goofing off
RICsNMN6Fb8,913120,917920,watching tv  playing video games
RICsNMN6Fb8,918240,924839,but when you put it together  suddenly it does not give you the life  you want and you start to feel
RICsNMN6Fb8,924839,930639,diseased  you don't feel good something's not  right something's off
RICsNMN6Fb8,930880,936560,but if you do all of the individual  things that are fun it ends up where you  feel like crap and if you do
RICsNMN6Fb8,936560,943199,individually all the things that are  hard and a struggle and are difficult  you end up feeling awesome
RICsNMN6Fb8,944800,951680,so  get up before the sun  be ready to attack
RICsNMN6Fb8,951680,958160,yes that means get up early  this will be hard at first but it will
RICsNMN6Fb8,958160,965120,become normal  and once you are accustomed to it early  rising is guaranteed to make your day
RICsNMN6Fb8,965120,971440,better  so get after it  if you could identify how you could give
RICsNMN6Fb8,971440,976720,more give more of your love give more of  your belief give more of your time give  more of your effort give more of your
RICsNMN6Fb8,976720,982480,energy you will go to the next level if  you're not feeling great about yourself  or where your life is right now the
RICsNMN6Fb8,982480,986720,pathway out of that is giving
RICsNMN6Fb8,988000,995199,you said many of us never realize our  greatness because we become sidetracked  by secondary activity you are the star
RICsNMN6Fb8,995199,1000480,of your show you are the director you're  writing the script  and you will determine whether your life
RICsNMN6Fb8,1000480,1007680,is a smash  office hit or flop  and it isn't enough to not do something
RICsNMN6Fb8,1007680,1014480,bad you have to be pursuing something  that matters  meaning purpose that's it that's the
RICsNMN6Fb8,1014480,1021519,game it isn't success it isn't wealth it  isn't adoration it's not trophies it's  not goals it's nothing other than
RICsNMN6Fb8,1021519,1028160,fulfillment  my biggest fear in life is if there is a
RICsNMN6Fb8,1028160,1034240,final resting place in this world and  there's a final judgment you talk to  something much bigger than you i don't
RICsNMN6Fb8,1034240,1039600,want to sit down and have a conversation  with someone that says you're in heaven  this is what you should have been on
RICsNMN6Fb8,1039600,1044640,earth  i want god to be up there right now  we're speaking writing stuff down saying
RICsNMN6Fb8,1044640,1052320,my god he exceeded even my expectations  that's how i lived my life i now know  that there is no cap on the human mind
RICsNMN6Fb8,1052320,1057720,there's no cap  we cap it ourselves
RICsNMN6Fb8,1066240,1073679,95 of our decisions are made by how you  feel in the moment and that is the  problem do you feel like making that
RICsNMN6Fb8,1073679,1080160,cold call no you don't do you feel like  doing that third set of reps no you  don't and if you accept the fact that
RICsNMN6Fb8,1080160,1085520,you may never feel ready and you may  never feel motivated and you may never  feel courageous and that's okay but you
RICsNMN6Fb8,1085520,1091520,can still push yourself forward as you  start to see yourself becoming the  person that takes action guess what
RICsNMN6Fb8,1091520,1096160,happens you build the skill of  confidence and courage
RICsNMN6Fb8,1097520,1103520,when you quit your mind does this  when you quit your mind says we're done  so it doesn't expand there's no
RICsNMN6Fb8,1103520,1109840,expansion when you quit when you say  [ __ ] you  uh-uh this sucks i'm drowning i'm
RICsNMN6Fb8,1109840,1115039,miserable i'm suffering i'm broken  but i'm not going anywhere what happens
RICsNMN6Fb8,1115039,1119280,to your mind  is it does this
RICsNMN6Fb8,1121039,1129039,it says  he's not leaving  so we got to expand we got to grow we
RICsNMN6Fb8,1129039,1133279,got to figure this [ __ ] thing out
RICsNMN6Fb8,1134720,1140640,so then these compartments in your brain  they have to work
RICsNMN6Fb8,1140640,1146080,and then you start to engage parts of  your mind that you've never engaged  before when you're in suffer mode and
RICsNMN6Fb8,1146080,1152880,you say i'm not going to quit you're  forcing your brain now to operate on a  level it's not used to you
RICsNMN6Fb8,1152880,1158400,but then it becomes used to it  the people who go after this stuff what
RICsNMN6Fb8,1158400,1164960,makes it worth it it's got to be your  passion you got to love it it's got to  be what you are supposed to do you want
RICsNMN6Fb8,1164960,1173279,to sing even though they want to invite  you to carnegie hall you're going to  sing to anybody that listens to you  including singing to yourself
RICsNMN6Fb8,1173520,1179840,you got to write even if no one  published your book right because that  was given to you to do
RICsNMN6Fb8,1179840,1185679,you do what it is you're supposed to  you're supposed to build something  you're supposed to create something i  don't know how to do it learn
RICsNMN6Fb8,1185679,1192320,do whatever is required it's you it's on  you you've got to make that happen  nobody's going to bring it to you on a  civil platter then here's your dream
RICsNMN6Fb8,1192320,1197679,manifested no it's hard yes it's hard  it's difficult yes right
RICsNMN6Fb8,1197679,1201039,and it's worth it
RICsNMN6Fb8,1202880,1209520,but i also believe at the end of my life  that the lord's going to go hey  i want to introduce you to somebody

RICsNMN6Fb8,1580720,1586720,your success then you can avoid your  responsibility because again that's not  clear  the problem with wanting something is
RICsNMN6Fb8,1586720,1591919,that in all probability you're going to  have to work for it you're going to have  to make sacrifices and it's certainly
RICsNMN6Fb8,1591919,1597919,possible that you want to avoid that  failing to make any of that clear

RICsNMN6Fb8,1666720,1671840,get where you want to go  this is one of the hoops that you have  to flip through
RICsNMN6Fb8,1671840,1678559,like you know exactly exactly what you  want you know exactly when you want it  listen to you know exactly what it

RICsNMN6Fb8,1718480,1724799,you have to learn  what do you  want in your life
RICsNMN6Fb8,1724799,1729840,it's okay to sit in a room by yourself  in a chair and just think
RICsNMN6Fb8,1729840,1733240,about you
RICsNMN6Fb8,1739850,1745120,[Music]  people's lives aren't what they would  like them to be
RICsNMN6Fb8,1745120,1751520,and so then you ask why  well forget about tragedy and  catastrophe because that's self-evident
RICsNMN6Fb8,1751520,1758000,but one of the main reasons that people  don't get what they want is because they  don't actually  figure out what it is
RICsNMN6Fb8,1758000,1765520,and the probability that you're going to  get what would be good for you let's say  which would even be better than what you  want right because you know you might be
RICsNMN6Fb8,1765520,1771760,wrong about what you want easily but  maybe you could get what would really be  good for you
RICsNMN6Fb8,1771760,1776960,well why don't you  because you don't try
RICsNMN6Fb8,1776960,1782159,the thing that makes individuals really  really special who are that great
RICsNMN6Fb8,1782159,1789760,is  they're always looking for that  competitive edge  so it's  interesting to see how a champion in
RICsNMN6Fb8,1789760,1794880,sports it's the same mindset  it's about winning the battles
RICsNMN6Fb8,1794880,1800960,continuing to improve  learning news ways to stay ahead uh stay  ahead of the game
RICsNMN6Fb8,1800960,1807399,clarity is what gives you the idea of  success
RICsNMN6Fb8,1808960,1815360,when you can see  and you can think and you can react with  a clear mind
RICsNMN6Fb8,1815360,1821200,he said if you worry about whether other  people think about you you will always  be their prisoner so
RICsNMN6Fb8,1821200,1826640,unless you're prepared to be other  people's prisoners at some point if  they're hurling dirt on you if they're
RICsNMN6Fb8,1826640,1832640,constantly trying to re-bury you under  the earth that you're trying to claw  your way out from  then
RICsNMN6Fb8,1832640,1838080,you're never going to get out you've got  to just stop worrying about what they  think so they can't actually affect you
RICsNMN6Fb8,1838080,1843440,they can only try to influence your  mindset
RICsNMN6Fb8,1843440,1850080,you don't think okay  here's what i would like if i could have  it i don't mean in a way that you
RICsNMN6Fb8,1850080,1855919,manipulate the world to force it to  deliver you goods for status or  something like that that isn't what i
RICsNMN6Fb8,1855919,1861039,mean i mean something like  imagine that you were taking care of  yourself like you were someone you
RICsNMN6Fb8,1861039,1866559,actually cared for  and then you thought okay i'm caring for  this person i would like things to go as
RICsNMN6Fb8,1866559,1873519,well for them as possible what would  their life have to be like in order for  that to be the case
RICsNMN6Fb8,1874880,1882720,no one will believe in you until you  believe in you and so  good people often become seduced by the
RICsNMN6Fb8,1882720,1888660,chatter of their loudest fears  [Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,1889360,1895360,do not let them you've got to understand  who you're trying to become believe in  your ability to get there to become that
RICsNMN6Fb8,1895360,1901440,person to understand that to continue to  beat yourself up for something in the  past is not going to serve you and so
RICsNMN6Fb8,1901440,1909919,for that very reason let it go  [Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,1909919,1916399,we are good in our comfort zones but the  moment we start to go blue ocean around  our next level
RICsNMN6Fb8,1916399,1921240,of mastery our fears come up
RICsNMN6Fb8,1933519,1940080,the mind is an instrument don't let it  play you  so it's it's a really powerful thing to
RICsNMN6Fb8,1940080,1946080,remember to be just  just remember that you know that that is  that's the job of the mind is to hold on
RICsNMN6Fb8,1946080,1952240,to things into to kind of attach to  things and it's your job to say i choose  this thought and i don't choose that and
RICsNMN6Fb8,1952240,1957518,i you know because whatever you give  energy to is what grows
RICsNMN6Fb8,1958000,1963120,you know where your energy goes is what  grows and it's like we have to choose
RICsNMN6Fb8,1963120,1968159,where we put our energy in because  that's where we go into manifest so it's  it's
RICsNMN6Fb8,1968159,1977159,the more  consciously and we can make those  choices and where we're letting our mind  go the better is going to be for us
RICsNMN6Fb8,1982559,1989200,because we're going out into the unknown  it's human you know if you look to look  at the  psychobiology of it and you were
RICsNMN6Fb8,1989200,1996720,studying the pure biology there's a term  called homeostasis human beings are  hardwired for a steady state what
RICsNMN6Fb8,1996720,2002799,happens is when we come up with a new  idea and when we see a new opportunity  and we start to leave our comfort zones
RICsNMN6Fb8,2002799,2008880,into the zone of the unknown where  greatness lives we get scared
RICsNMN6Fb8,2008880,2015840,and so i think it starts with realizing  your life is not random you are not here  by accident when you arrive on whatever
RICsNMN6Fb8,2015840,2020880,scene it is heaven touches earth your  goodness your life your creativity is
RICsNMN6Fb8,2020880,2027399,heaven touching earth and that  perspective changes the way we show up  in the world
RICsNMN6Fb8,2035360,2040480,no nostalgia for catastrophe  i think that's what that means is that
RICsNMN6Fb8,2040480,2046640,when you  leave  what's not good you wash the dust off  your feet
RICsNMN6Fb8,2046640,2053440,and you don't look back  and that's a very harsh lesson  that there's no excuses whatsoever for
RICsNMN6Fb8,2053440,2059000,not getting up and getting at it that's  what it means
RICsNMN6Fb8,2061280,2066878,it even means that  when people are beset with a catastrophe  like that they are prone to use that as
RICsNMN6Fb8,2066878,2073280,an excuse  for not going about the business that  they should be going about  because they can say to themselves well
RICsNMN6Fb8,2073280,2078800,i would accept  and accept there's always good reasons i  mean believe me there's always good
RICsNMN6Fb8,2078800,2084960,reasons for not doing what you should  that's for sure the reasons pile up day  after day to not do what you should
RICsNMN6Fb8,2084960,2090240,especially because you're you're aiming  at things in the future you can put them  off indefinitely right because of the
RICsNMN6Fb8,2090240,2097200,demands of the day  when you leave somewhere terrible do not  look back there's no nostalgia
RICsNMN6Fb8,2097200,2102240,that's that's the letting  the dead parts of yourself go
RICsNMN6Fb8,2102240,2107440,[Music]  to experience drastic positive change
RICsNMN6Fb8,2107440,2112880,and here's the thing about running away  from your problems
RICsNMN6Fb8,2112880,2118800,running away from your past have you  ever noticed that when you run away
RICsNMN6Fb8,2118800,2124240,it tends to follow you  and then if you're going to follow the
RICsNMN6Fb8,2124240,2131838,good there's no excuse not to do it and  that and it means no excuse whatsoever  under any circumstances
RICsNMN6Fb8,2132320,2138880,there's no  excuse  whatsoever  for not getting at what it is that you
RICsNMN6Fb8,2138880,2142279,should be doing
RICsNMN6Fb8,2158960,2164640,imagine you could press pause on a  thought  imagine you could use that time to just
RICsNMN6Fb8,2164640,2170560,reflect  take a step back  observe  imagine you could fast forward to
RICsNMN6Fb8,2170560,2175680,something in the past learn from it  straight away  and then press play again when you felt
RICsNMN6Fb8,2175680,2181280,comfortable  [Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,2181280,2187839,mindfulness really allows you to find  that clarity  time
RICsNMN6Fb8,2187839,2196119,so that you can actually  navigate your mind  and not just be led by it
RICsNMN6Fb8,2196400,2203130,[Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,2206400,2212640,let's suppose that you were able every  night to dream any dream you wanted to  dream
RICsNMN6Fb8,2213119,2219520,and that you could for example have the  power  within one night to dream 75 years of
RICsNMN6Fb8,2219520,2225359,time  or any length of time you wanted to have
RICsNMN6Fb8,2225599,2233119,and you would naturally as you began on  this adventure of dreams you would  fulfill all your wishes
RICsNMN6Fb8,2237359,2243200,but now let's um let's have a surprise  let's have a dream which isn't under
RICsNMN6Fb8,2243200,2250559,control  [Music]  well something is going to happen to me  that i don't know what it's going to be
RICsNMN6Fb8,2251110,2256240,[Music]  then you would get more and more  adventurous and you would make further
RICsNMN6Fb8,2256240,2262480,and further out gambles as to what you  would dream  and finally you would dream
RICsNMN6Fb8,2262480,2265280,where you are now
RICsNMN6Fb8,2269359,2276160,when you realize that  every single day could be your last or  when you appreciate that no matter how
RICsNMN6Fb8,2276160,2282640,long you live life is a short ride  you just sort of let go of the fears and  you let go of the limits and you live
RICsNMN6Fb8,2282640,2288240,full-on and you seize opportunities and  you have real conversations with real
RICsNMN6Fb8,2288240,2294480,people and you sort of wear your heart  on your sleeve and you bring on the  fullness of your authenticity
RICsNMN6Fb8,2294480,2300319,and you do whatever it takes to get your  loftiest dreams to get done
RICsNMN6Fb8,2301040,2306640,the point is that there's some games you  don't get to play unless you're all in  and the other thing that's so
RICsNMN6Fb8,2306640,2314079,interesting about being alive is that  you're all in  no matter what you do you're all in this
RICsNMN6Fb8,2314079,2321119,is gonna kill you  so i think you might as well play the  most magnificent game you can
RICsNMN6Fb8,2321119,2326560,while you're waiting because  do you have anything better to do  really
RICsNMN6Fb8,2326560,2332640,why not pick the best thing possible  that you could do  why not do that maybe you could justify
RICsNMN6Fb8,2332640,2338160,your wretched existence to yourself that  way i think you could that's what it  looks like
RICsNMN6Fb8,2338160,2343839,you know people find such meaning in  their responsibilities they adopt it  stops making them ask questions about
RICsNMN6Fb8,2343839,2347849,what life is for  [Music]
RICsNMN6Fb8,2349359,2354800,follow your passion first  first first first first  and you got to sit there and ask
RICsNMN6Fb8,2354800,2361200,yourself okay what am i truly passionate  about what do i enjoy doing  and when you feel that way i honestly i
RICsNMN6Fb8,2361200,2367359,mean you feel like you've never worked a  day in your life it's the most fun thing  in the world you get up in the morning  excited about what you're doing and you

RICsNMN6Fb8,2372800,2379359,else  do something else and those are hard  decisions to make but when you make  those decisions it's a very liberating
RICsNMN6Fb8,2379359,2384320,experience and you find out that the  rewards will come

RICsNMN6Fb8,2462160,2469200,the right moment  but this is the right moment that we we  look back a year in our life five years
RICsNMN6Fb8,2469200,2474400,ago  and we rarely say  uh i'm disappointed that i spoke up i'm
RICsNMN6Fb8,2474400,2480640,disappointed that i did my art i'm  disappointed that i connected to  somebody we don't what we regret is not
RICsNMN6Fb8,2480640,2486640,doing that  that responsibility is never given it's  taken  and then if you choose to take

RICsNMN6Fb8,2557520,2562800,going backwards  and it seems like the more we mature
RICsNMN6Fb8,2562800,2569440,the more responsible our dreams become  the more governors we put on ourselves  and our ability to dream
RICsNMN6Fb8,2569440,2575599,and to reimagine  and it's always a fight for you guys to  make sure that your dreams always stay
RICsNMN6Fb8,2575599,2581680,pure  so it's not a matter of of  pushing beyond the limitations or
RICsNMN6Fb8,2581680,2587520,expectations it's really a matter of  protecting your dreams protecting your  imagination
