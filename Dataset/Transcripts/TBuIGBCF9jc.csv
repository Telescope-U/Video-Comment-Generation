TBuIGBCF9jc,370,3778,What starts here changes the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,7000,9929,I have a few suggestions that may help you on your way to a better world
TBuIGBCF9jc,9929,13709,"and while these lessons were learned during my time in the military,"
TBuIGBCF9jc,14230,19560,"I can assure you that it matters not, whether you ever served a day in uniform, it matters"
TBuIGBCF9jc,19560,24750,"not your gender your ethnic or religious background, your orientation or your social status."
TBuIGBCF9jc,25420,30269,Our struggles in this world are similar and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward
TBuIGBCF9jc,30960,35059,Changing ourselves and changing the world around us will apply equally to all
TBuIGBCF9jc,39740,46220,So here are the ten lessons I learned from basic Seal training that hopefully will be of value to you as you move forward in life
TBuIGBCF9jc,47480,52600,Every morning in seal training my instructors who at the time were all Vietnam veterans
TBuIGBCF9jc,53140,59180,"Would show up in my barracks room. And the first thing they'd do is inspect my bed if you did it right,"
TBuIGBCF9jc,59740,62280,"the corners would be square, the covers would be pulled tight,"
TBuIGBCF9jc,62480,67599,the pillows centered just under the headboard and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack.
TBuIGBCF9jc,68300,70300,It was a simple task
TBuIGBCF9jc,70610,74080,mundane at best but every morning we were required to
TBuIGBCF9jc,74660,76520,Make our bed to perfection
TBuIGBCF9jc,76520,83889,It seemed a little ridiculous at the time particularly light of the fact that we were aspiring to be real warriors tough battle-hardened seals
TBuIGBCF9jc,84770,89950,But the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over.
TBuIGBCF9jc,90890,92890,If you make your bed every morning
TBuIGBCF9jc,93110,95649,You will have accomplished the first task of the day
TBuIGBCF9jc,96530,101349,it will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and
TBuIGBCF9jc,101720,108400,Another and another and by the end of the day that one task completed will have turned into many task completed
TBuIGBCF9jc,108710,113290,Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter
TBuIGBCF9jc,113810,115810,"If you can't do the little things, right"
TBuIGBCF9jc,116329,121119,You'll never be able to do the big things right and if by chance you have a miserable day
TBuIGBCF9jc,121790,123790,You will come home to a bed that is made
TBuIGBCF9jc,125600,127350,That you made
TBuIGBCF9jc,127350,131220,And a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better
TBuIGBCF9jc,131700,133700,So if you want to change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,134020,136020,Start off by making your bed
TBuIGBCF9jc,136020,138020,[Music]
TBuIGBCF9jc,142519,144519,During seal training the students
TBuIGBCF9jc,145440,148140,During training the students are all broken down into boat crews
TBuIGBCF9jc,148280,154780,Each crew is seven students three on each side of a small rubber boat and one Coxon to help guide the dinghy
TBuIGBCF9jc,155320,157740,every day your boat crew forms up on the beach and
TBuIGBCF9jc,157879,162609,Is instructed to get through the surf zone and paddle several miles down the coast in the winter
TBuIGBCF9jc,162860,168120,The surf off San Diego can get to be eight to ten feet high and it is exceedingly difficult
TBuIGBCF9jc,168460,171840,The paddle hook through the plunging surf unless everyone digs in
TBuIGBCF9jc,172910,176979,Every paddle must be synchronized to the stroke count of the Coxon
TBuIGBCF9jc,177739,184179,Everyone must exert equal effort or the boat will turn against the wave and be unceremoniously dumped back on the beach
TBuIGBCF9jc,185060,187060,For the boat to make it to its destination
TBuIGBCF9jc,188090,189950,Everyone must paddle
TBuIGBCF9jc,189950,191950,You can't change the world alone
TBuIGBCF9jc,192260,198220,You will need some help and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friends colleagues
TBuIGBCF9jc,198920,204760,The good will of strangers and a strong Coxen to guide you if you want to change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,205040,207040,Find someone to help you paddle over
TBuIGBCF9jc,208370,212920,A few weeks of difficult training my seal class which started with 150 men
TBuIGBCF9jc,213650,218439,Was down to just 42 there were now six boat crews of seven men each. I
TBuIGBCF9jc,219200,221200,Was in the boat with the tall guys
TBuIGBCF9jc,221569,223569,but the best boat crew we had
TBuIGBCF9jc,223760,229209,Was made up of little guys the Munchkin crew. We called them. No one was over five foot five
TBuIGBCF9jc,230299,233259,The Munchkin boat crew had one american-indian
TBuIGBCF9jc,233780,239679,One african-american one Polish American one Greek American one Italian American and two tough kids from the Midwest
TBuIGBCF9jc,240380,246939,They out paddled out ran and out swam all the other boat crews the big men and the other boat crews
TBuIGBCF9jc,247519,249759,will always make good-natured fun of
TBuIGBCF9jc,250489,257018,The tiny little flippers the munchkins put on their tiny little feet prior to every swim
TBuIGBCF9jc,258079,263228,But somehow these little guys from every corner of the nation in the world always had the last laugh
TBuIGBCF9jc,263930,267310,Swimming faster than everyone and reaching the shore long before the rest of us
TBuIGBCF9jc,268490,270490,SEAL training was a great equalizer
TBuIGBCF9jc,271010,277390,"Nothing mattered, but your will to succeed not your color. Not your ethnic background, not your education, not your social status"
TBuIGBCF9jc,278120,280120,If you want to change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,280400,282400,measure a person by the size of their heart
TBuIGBCF9jc,282950,284950,not by the size of their flippers
TBuIGBCF9jc,286370,288370,Several times a week
TBuIGBCF9jc,288380,291219,The instructors would line up the class and do a uniform inspection
TBuIGBCF9jc,292100,293930,It was exceptionally thorough
TBuIGBCF9jc,293930,300759,Your hat had to be perfectly starched your uniform immaculately pressed your belt buckle shiny and void of any smudges
TBuIGBCF9jc,301760,307480,But it seemed that no matter how much effort you put into starching your hat or pressing your uniform or polishing your belt buckle
TBuIGBCF9jc,308030,309920,It just wasn't good enough
TBuIGBCF9jc,309920,312039,The instructors would find something wrong
TBuIGBCF9jc,312800,318460,For failing the uniform inspection the student had to run fully clothed into the surf zone
TBuIGBCF9jc,319250,324610,Then wet from head to toe roll around on the beach until every part of your body was covered with sand
TBuIGBCF9jc,325220,327220,the effect was known as
TBuIGBCF9jc,327290,329290,sugar-cookie
TBuIGBCF9jc,329720,333730,You stayed in the uniform the rest of the day cold wet and Sandy
TBuIGBCF9jc,334460,337238,There were many a student who just couldn't accept the fact that
TBuIGBCF9jc,337640,339120,"All their efforts were in vain that no matter how hard they tried to get the uniform right,"
TBuIGBCF9jc,342020,349659,It went unappreciated those students didn't make it through training those students didn't understand the purpose of the drill
TBuIGBCF9jc,350360,356258,You were never going to succeed you were never going to have a perfect uniform the instructors weren't going to allow it
TBuIGBCF9jc,357320,359320,Sometimes no matter how well you prepare
TBuIGBCF9jc,359510,363369,Or how well you perform you still end up as a sugar cookie
TBuIGBCF9jc,364040,366040,It's just the way life is sometimes
TBuIGBCF9jc,366710,368710,If you want to change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,368960,371919,Get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward
TBuIGBCF9jc,373000,380680,Every day during training you were challenged with multiple physical events long runs long swims obstacle courses hours of calisthenics
TBuIGBCF9jc,381280,387639,Something designed to test your mettle every event had standards times you had to meet if you fail to meet those times
TBuIGBCF9jc,388160,392170,Those standards your name was posted on a list and at the end of the day
TBuIGBCF9jc,392730,394320,Those on the list
TBuIGBCF9jc,394320,396649,were invited to a circus a
TBuIGBCF9jc,397110,402469,Circus was two hours of additional calisthenics designed to wear you down to break your spirit to force you to quit
TBuIGBCF9jc,402810,406970,No one wanted a circus a circus meant that for that day
TBuIGBCF9jc,407340,410929,You didn't measure up a circus meant more fatigue and more fatigue
TBuIGBCF9jc,411210,414530,Meant that the following day would be more difficult and more circuses were likely
TBuIGBCF9jc,415440,418339,But at some time during seal training everyone
TBuIGBCF9jc,419610,421788,Everyone made the circus list
TBuIGBCF9jc,422910,427429,But an interesting thing happened to those who were constantly on the list
TBuIGBCF9jc,428100,434779,Over time those students who did two hours of extra calisthenics got stronger and stronger
TBuIGBCF9jc,435540,438830,The pain of the circuses built inner strength and physical resiliency
TBuIGBCF9jc,440250,442250,Life is filled with circuses
TBuIGBCF9jc,442830,444360,You will fail
TBuIGBCF9jc,444360,451969,You will likely fail often it will be painful. It will be discouraging at times. It will test you to your very core
TBuIGBCF9jc,452790,455520,but if you want to change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,455520,457520,Don't be afraid of the circuses
TBuIGBCF9jc,458340,461449,"At least twice a week, the trainees were required to run the obstacle course"
TBuIGBCF9jc,462870,466429,the obstacle course contained 25 obstacles including the 10-foot wall a
TBuIGBCF9jc,467190,471320,30-foot cargo net a barbed wire crawl to name a few but the most challenging obstacle
TBuIGBCF9jc,471960,473699,Was the slide for life
TBuIGBCF9jc,473700,481309,It had a three level 30-foot tower at one end and a one level Tower at the other in between was a 200-foot long rope
TBuIGBCF9jc,481830,486770,You had to climb the three tiered Tower and once at the top you grabbed the Rope
TBuIGBCF9jc,487410,489410,swung underneath the rope and
TBuIGBCF9jc,489570,492559,Pulled yourself hand over hand until you got to the other end
TBuIGBCF9jc,492930,499250,The record for the obstacle course had stood for years when my class began in 1977. The record seemed unbeatable
TBuIGBCF9jc,500070,503779,Until one day a student decided to go down the slide for life
TBuIGBCF9jc,505020,506410,headfirst
TBuIGBCF9jc,506410,511800,Instead of swinging his body underneath the rope and inching his way down. He bravely mounted the top of the rope and
TBuIGBCF9jc,512349,514979,Thrust himself forward it was a dangerous move
TBuIGBCF9jc,515560,517710,Seemingly foolish and fraught with risk
TBuIGBCF9jc,518500,521400,Failure could be an injury and being dropped from the course without hesitation
TBuIGBCF9jc,521919,524489,the students slid down the Rope perilously fast
TBuIGBCF9jc,525100,530100,Instead of several minutes. It only took him half that time and by the end of the course
TBuIGBCF9jc,531010,533010,He had broken the record
TBuIGBCF9jc,533350,535350,If you want to change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,535540,537990,Sometimes you have to slide down the obstacles headfirst
TBuIGBCF9jc,539950,545789,During the land warfare phase of training the students are flown out to San Clemente Island which lies off the coast of San Diego
TBuIGBCF9jc,546430,550080,the waters off San Clemente are a breeding ground for the great white sharks to
TBuIGBCF9jc,550780,553979,Pass seal training. They're a series of long swims that must be completed
TBuIGBCF9jc,554530,556360,One is the night swim
TBuIGBCF9jc,556360,561959,Before the swim the instructors. Joyfully brief the students on all the species of sharks
TBuIGBCF9jc,562720,564868,"That inhabit the waters off, San Clemente"
TBuIGBCF9jc,565720,569009,They assure you however that no student has
TBuIGBCF9jc,569650,573569,Ever been eaten by a shark at least not that they can remember
TBuIGBCF9jc,575110,579510,But you are also taught that if a shark begins to circle your position
TBuIGBCF9jc,580270,581830,Stand your ground
TBuIGBCF9jc,581830,583750,Do not swim away
TBuIGBCF9jc,583750,585750,Do not act afraid
TBuIGBCF9jc,585910,591899,and if the shark hungry for a midnight snack darts towards you then summons up all your strength and
TBuIGBCF9jc,592540,595649,Punch him in the snout and he will turn and swim away
TBuIGBCF9jc,597130,599130,There are a lot of sharks in the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,599290,603209,If you hope to complete the swim you will have to deal with them
TBuIGBCF9jc,604060,606060,So if you want to change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,607069,609069,Don't back down from the sharpest
TBuIGBCF9jc,610100,614529,"As Navy SEALS, one of our jobs is to conduct underwater attacks against the enemy's shipping"
TBuIGBCF9jc,615079,618399,we practice this technique extensively during training the
TBuIGBCF9jc,618979,625029,Ship attack mission is where a pair of SEAL divers is dropped off outside an enemy harbor and then swims well over two miles
TBuIGBCF9jc,625729,630729,"Underwater using nothing, but a depth gauge and a compass to get to the target"
TBuIGBCF9jc,631579,636818,During the entire swim even well below the surface. There is some light
TBuIGBCF9jc,637639,639229,That comes through
TBuIGBCF9jc,639229,642609,It is comforting to know that there is open water above you
TBuIGBCF9jc,643759,648099,But as you approach the ship which is tied to appear the light begins to fade
TBuIGBCF9jc,648859,655629,The steel structure of the ship blocks the moonlight. It blocks the surrounding streetlamps. It blocks all
TBuIGBCF9jc,656209,657649,ambient light
TBuIGBCF9jc,657649,659109,to be successful in your mission
TBuIGBCF9jc,659109,664959,You have to swim under the ship and find the keel the centerline and the deepest part of the ship. This is your objective
TBuIGBCF9jc,665959,668227,But the keel is also the darkest part of the show
TBuIGBCF9jc,668749,674139,where you cannot see your hand in front of your face where the noise from the ship's machinery is deafening and
TBuIGBCF9jc,674539,678639,Where it gets to be easily disoriented and you can fail
TBuIGBCF9jc,679159,680929,every SEAL knows
TBuIGBCF9jc,680929,687939,that under the keel at that darkest moment of the mission is a time when you need to be calm when
TBuIGBCF9jc,688489,695918,You must be called when you must be composed when all your tactical skills your physical power and your inner strength
TBuIGBCF9jc,696589,698299,Must be brought to bear
TBuIGBCF9jc,698299,700418,If you want to change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,701299,704589,You must be your very best in the darkest moments
TBuIGBCF9jc,705950,708520,The ninth week of training is referred to as hell week
TBuIGBCF9jc,709280,711280,It is six days of no sleep
TBuIGBCF9jc,711710,716860,Constant physical and mental harassment and one special day at the mud flats
TBuIGBCF9jc,717290,723819,the mud flats are an area between San Diego and Tijuana where the rough water runs off and creates the Tijuana sloughs a
TBuIGBCF9jc,724310,726819,Swampy patch of terrain where the mud will engulf you
TBuIGBCF9jc,727610,729529,It is on Wednesday of hell week
TBuIGBCF9jc,729530,734769,that you paddle down in the mud flats and spend the next 15 hours trying to survive this freezing cold the
TBuIGBCF9jc,735140,738910,Howling wind and the incessant pressure to quit from the instructors
TBuIGBCF9jc,739970,742209,As the Sun began to set that Wednesday evening
TBuIGBCF9jc,742910,746860,My training class having committed some egregious infraction of the rules
TBuIGBCF9jc,747860,749860,Was ordered into the mud
TBuIGBCF9jc,749990,754180,The mud consumed each man till there was nothing visible but our heads
TBuIGBCF9jc,755120,759459,The instructors told us we could leave the mud if only five men would quit
TBuIGBCF9jc,760070,764050,Only five minutes just five men and we could get out of the oppressive cold
TBuIGBCF9jc,765260,768310,Looking around the mud flat it was apparent that some students were about to give up
TBuIGBCF9jc,769400,773800,it was still over eight hours till the Sun came up eight more hours of
TBuIGBCF9jc,774440,779139,Bone-chilling cold a chattering teeth and the shivering moans of the trainees were so loud
TBuIGBCF9jc,779870,781870,it was hard to hear anything and
TBuIGBCF9jc,782360,785529,Then one voice began to echo through the night
TBuIGBCF9jc,786830,788830,one voice raised in song
TBuIGBCF9jc,789830,794170,"The song was terribly out of tune, but sung with great enthusiasm"
TBuIGBCF9jc,795440,800799,One voice became two and two became three and before long everyone in the class was singing
TBuIGBCF9jc,801110,806498,the instructors threatened us with more time in the mud if we kept up the singing but the singing persisted and
TBuIGBCF9jc,806960,813699,Somehow the mud seemed a little warmer and the wind a little tamer and the dawn not so far away
TBuIGBCF9jc,814400,819730,if I have learned anything in my time traveling the world it is the power of
TBuIGBCF9jc,820450,822339,the power of one person
TBuIGBCF9jc,822339,829979,The Washington a Lincoln King Mandela and even a young girl from Pakistan Malala one person can change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,830830,834149,By giving people hope so if you want to change the world
TBuIGBCF9jc,835210,837269,Start singing when you're up to your neck in mud
TBuIGBCF9jc,839110,841140,Finally a SEAL training there's a bell a
TBuIGBCF9jc,842440,846330,brass bell that hangs in the center of the compound for all the students to see
TBuIGBCF9jc,847000,851309,All you have to do quit. All you have to do to quit is ring the bell
TBuIGBCF9jc,852130,856529,ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at 5 o'clock ring the bell and you
TBuIGBCF9jc,856870,859679,No longer have to be in the freezing cold swims
TBuIGBCF9jc,860110,866969,Ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs the obstacle course the PT and you no longer have to endure
TBuIGBCF9jc,867490,869490,the hardships of training
TBuIGBCF9jc,870070,872219,All you have to do is ring the bell to get out
TBuIGBCF9jc,873700,877709,If you want to change the world don't ever ever
TBuIGBCF9jc,878440,880299,Ring the bell
TBuIGBCF9jc,880299,882299,It will not be easy
TBuIGBCF9jc,882399,884399,Start each day with a task completed
TBuIGBCF9jc,884949,886949,Find someone to help you through life
TBuIGBCF9jc,886989,890999,Respect everyone know the life is not fair that you will fail often
TBuIGBCF9jc,891609,893559,but if you take some risks
TBuIGBCF9jc,893559,895559,Step up on the time through the toughest
TBuIGBCF9jc,895569,903149,Face down the bullies lift up the downtrodden and never ever give up. If you do these things the next generation and the
TBuIGBCF9jc,903819,907589,Generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we have today
TBuIGBCF9jc,907589,913318,And what started here will indeed have changed the world for the better?
TBuIGBCF9jc,914109,916109,Thank you very much
