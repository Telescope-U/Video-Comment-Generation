aiU4xQ7ICM4,63949,66020,with an even lower center of gravity
aiU4xQ7ICM4,66020,71600,than he has 43 of them you all know
aiU4xQ7ICM4,71600,76070,Tyreke L right there is one rule to this
aiU4xQ7ICM4,76070,80990,game you gotta grab Tariq's flag you're
aiU4xQ7ICM4,80990,88310,ready to do this Tyreke is facing a wall
aiU4xQ7ICM4,88310,90970,of youth football players that combined
aiU4xQ7ICM4,90970,94069,have a horizontal reach that could span
aiU4xQ7ICM4,94069,97489,16 yards farther than the entire width
aiU4xQ7ICM4,97489,99490,of the field
aiU4xQ7ICM4,99490,102400,after fielding the kick Tyriq begins his
aiU4xQ7ICM4,102400,109360,return with a verbal juice it's damning
aiU4xQ7ICM4,109360,112710,at a Jonas 510 during his sprint
aiU4xQ7ICM4,112710,116110,Tyreke short choppy strides allow his
aiU4xQ7ICM4,116110,118750,feet to be in contact with the ground
aiU4xQ7ICM4,118750,123009,for 80% of each stride or about ten
aiU4xQ7ICM4,123009,125530,percent longer than a taller receiver
aiU4xQ7ICM4,125530,128709,like Julio Jones being anchored to the
aiU4xQ7ICM4,128709,131170,ground longer gives Tyreke of longer
aiU4xQ7ICM4,131170,133989,opportunity to initiate a cut during
aiU4xQ7ICM4,133989,137200,each stride this helps Tyreke make
aiU4xQ7ICM4,137200,138900,slight adjustments through traffic
aiU4xQ7ICM4,138900,141970,adjusting inspector by at least 15
aiU4xQ7ICM4,141970,144940,degrees three times in just over a
aiU4xQ7ICM4,144940,147250,second while still maintaining a
aiU4xQ7ICM4,147250,149980,velocity over 20 miles per hour
aiU4xQ7ICM4,149980,154500,and after covering a total distance of
aiU4xQ7ICM4,154500,159730,157 yards tarik has finally brought down
aiU4xQ7ICM4,159730,164600,at the 48-yard and after a second run
aiU4xQ7ICM4,164600,167540,back in which an untouched flag just
aiU4xQ7ICM4,167540,168770,fell off
aiU4xQ7ICM4,168770,171980,we re secured the flags and he faced the
aiU4xQ7ICM4,171980,178910,kids one more time but a bit of extra
aiU4xQ7ICM4,178910,180920,security doesn't make any difference
aiU4xQ7ICM4,180920,183740,because they can't lay a finger on him
aiU4xQ7ICM4,183740,188540,as it goes past 43 kids untouched on his
aiU4xQ7ICM4,188540,191190,way for six
