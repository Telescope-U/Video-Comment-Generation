3tPIOy-dtbs,85385,92892,HE ARGUED THAT WHEN HE REFUSED  TO GO ALONG WITH THE  PRESIDENT'S PLAN HE BECAME THE  MAIN TARGET OF THE STOP TO  MARCH ON THE CAPITOL. 
3tPIOy-dtbs,92892,98030,THEY SAY IT WASN'T JUST PENS  THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS PUTTING  PRESSURE ON IN THE RESULTS OF   THE ELECTION.   TODAY'S HEARING WILL FOCUS ON 
3tPIOy-dtbs,98030,107106,THE PRESIDENT PRESSURE CAMPAIGN   TO GET LOCAL AND STATE OFFICIALS  IN BATTLEGROUND STATES TO   OVERTURN THE RESULTS. WE EXPECT

3tPIOy-dtbs,144543,149815,"THEM.   I THINK IT IS TODAY'S HEARING,  SOMETHING OF A PREQUEL TO THE   HEARING THAT WE SAW ON  THURSDAY.   WHAT WE WILL HERE TODAY ARE THE "
3tPIOy-dtbs,149815,154954,STEPS THAT TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES   ENGAGED IN ALONG THE WAY FROM   MID-NOVEMBER UP UNTIL THE   BEGINNING OF JANUARY.   THAT FAILED TO COME UP WITH 
3tPIOy-dtbs,154954,160326,"SOME OTHER WAY TO OVERTURN THE  ELECTION RESULTS, LEADING,  ULTIMATELY, THAT PRESSURE ON"
3tPIOy-dtbs,160326,166199,"MIKE PENCE.   ON THE DAY OF THE ATTACK OF THE   CAPITOL ITSELF.   NOW, WE WILL HEAR FROM TWO"
3tPIOy-dtbs,166199,173940,"ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM THE  STATE OF GEORGIA WHO STORIES  HAVE BEEN FAIRLY WELL TOLD.   THE SECRETARY OF STATE, BRAD,   AND HIS DEPUTY, WHO WERE"
3tPIOy-dtbs,173940,179612,"PRESSURED REPEATEDLY BY TRUMP,  INCLUDING ON THAT RECORDED  PHONE CALL, TO COME UP WITH   VOTES THAT MIGHT TURN THE "
3tPIOy-dtbs,179612,187353,TRADITIONALLY RED STATE BACK  INTO THE RED COLUMN WHEN JOE  BIDEN HAD ONE IT OUT RIGHT. 
3tPIOy-dtbs,187353,194027,"NOW, THERE IS TESTIMONY.  AT THE GOBI NEW TO MOST   AMERICANS FROM THE REPUBLICAN   SPEAKER OF THE STATE HOUSE AND  ARIZONA, WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF, "
3tPIOy-dtbs,194027,199465,"ALSO, A LENGTHY PRESSURE  CAMPAIGN.   LARGELY LED BY RUDY GIULIANI TO   TRY TO GET UP WITH VOTES THERE.   OR TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATE"
3tPIOy-dtbs,199465,204636,COLLECTORS. THAT IS ANOTHER   KIND OF KEY TERMS THAT WILL BE
3tPIOy-dtbs,204636,211477,"INTRODUCED TODAY.   THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW,  REGARDLESS OF THE VOTES IN THE  STATE, THE VOTES THAT COUNTED   IN WASHINGTON, WOULD COME FROM"
3tPIOy-dtbs,211477,216616,"THESE ALTERNATE COLLECTORS.   SO, WE WILL HEAR MUCH MORE  ABOUT THOSE TWO STATES IN   PARTICULAR TODAY. BUT, NOT JUST "
3tPIOy-dtbs,216616,221988,THEM.   EXPECT TO HEAR RECORDED   TESTIMONY GOING DOWN SIMILAR  PATHS IN THE STATES LIKE
3tPIOy-dtbs,221988,230697,"MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA.  >> GARRETT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST   HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE HAVE   REALLY FOCUSED ON JANUARY 4th,"

3tPIOy-dtbs,245445,253152,"ALLEGE IT BEGAN BEFORE ELECTION   DAY.  BUT, AT LEAST STARTED TO TAKE,  TOOK, TOOK, STARTED TO BECOME   SERIOUS ON ELECTION DAY."
3tPIOy-dtbs,253152,258725,">> YEAH, CHUCK.   THE COMMITTEE HAS ALWAYS SAID   THEY BELIEVE THE THIS IS A WIDE-  RANGING CONSPIRACY.   THAT JANUARY 6th WAS NOT SOME "
3tPIOy-dtbs,258725,267166,"SINGLE DISCRETE EVENT.  IT WAS THE LAST STEP,   BASICALLY, IN A MULTI-TEST UP "
3tPIOy-dtbs,267166,272372,BLOCK TO TRY TO KEEP DONALD   TRUMP IN POWER BY ANY MEANS   NECESSARY.  I BELIEVE THEY WILL SHOW THAT   THE GENESIS OF THIS IDEA
3tPIOy-dtbs,272372,277977,"STARTED BEFORE THE ELECTION.  BUT, REALLY, AS IT BECAME   INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT SOME OF   THESE TRADITIONALLY RED STATES, "
3tPIOy-dtbs,277977,284951,"IN PARTICULAR, WERE NOT GOING   TO GO DONALD TRUMP'S WAY, THIS  PLAN WENT INTO MOTION IN  NOVEMBER, REALLY CARRIED ALL  THE WAY THROUGH DECEMBER AND, I "
3tPIOy-dtbs,284951,291557,"THINK, CRITICALLY, THE  COMMITTEE WILL ARGUE, IN SOME   WAYS, CONTINUES TO THIS DAY,  THE IDEA OF SHOWING DISTRESSED"
3tPIOy-dtbs,291557,298765,"IN ELECTION RESULTS, AT ANY   LEVEL IS KIND OF THE LONG   TENTACLES OF THIS CLASS THAT"
3tPIOy-dtbs,298765,305571,BEGAN SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON   DONALD TRUMP YOUR BUT HAS NOW   BEEN CO-OPTED BY OTHER FIGURES  WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

3tPIOy-dtbs,345545,353920,"KRISTEN, TODAY, WE WILL HERE,   WE PLAYED IT IN THE OPENING.  YOU KNOW, THE SINGLE MOST LEGAL "
3tPIOy-dtbs,353920,359959,"EXPOSURE THE PRESIDENT MAY HAVE   IS THE EFFORTS, THE AGGRESSIVE  EFFORTS HE MADE IN THE STATE OF "
3tPIOy-dtbs,359959,365698,"GEORGIA.  THAT, WITH ROETHLISBERGER   TESTIFIED.  WHO WILL BE BACK A TRUMP  CHALLENGE?  HE IS COMING IN WITH SOME "
3tPIOy-dtbs,365698,371304,POLITICAL PEP.  PERHAPS HE DIDN'T HAVE SIX  WEEKS AGO.  WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WOULD HAVE
3tPIOy-dtbs,371304,379912,SEEN HIM.   HE COULD BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A  RUNOFF. 
3tPIOy-dtbs,379912,385751,>> IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT.   I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE   HEAD.   THIS COULD BE THE DATE WHERE WE   SEE THE GREATEST LEGAL EXPOSURE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,385751,393893,FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.   THIS IS WHERE THE BATTLE WAS  PLAYING OUT TO TRY TO GET THE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,393893,399131,"RESULT OF THE ELECTION  OVERTURNED.   LAST WEEK, WE MET JOHN EASTMAN.   WHO WAS THE PERSON WHO WAS  ADVISING TRUMP THAT HE COULD"
3tPIOy-dtbs,399131,409942,"OVERTURN THESE RESULTS.   TODAY, WE WILL LEARN JUST HOW   FAR REACHING THOSE EFFORTS"
3tPIOy-dtbs,409942,416015,"WENT.   NOT JUST FROM EASTMAN, NOT JUST   FROM TRUMP, BUT FROM MARK   MEADOWS AS WELL.  I'M TOLD WE WILL GET NEW  INFORMATION ABOUT HIS   INVOLVEMENT, CHUCK. "
3tPIOy-dtbs,416015,421487,"SO FAR, WE TALKED TO THE LEGAL  ANALYSTS, THEY SAY THERE HASN'T   BEEN A REAL SMOKING GUN YET.  WE HAVEN'T HEARD A CONVERSATION "
3tPIOy-dtbs,421487,435968,"WHERE THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAID   HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS   ILLEGAL.  BUT, TODAY IS GOING TO REALLY   FLESH THAT IDEA OUT."
3tPIOy-dtbs,435968,441207,"WE ARE TOLD.  WILL THERE BE A SMOKING GUN   TODAY?  THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  BUT, AGAIN, I THINK IT WILL   REALLY LEAN INTO THE LEGAL"
3tPIOy-dtbs,441207,446278,EXPOSURE FOR THE FORMER   PRESIDENT.  I ALSO THINK IT'S GOING TO  UNDERSCORE A KEY ARGUMENT THAT  WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE JANUARY  6th TO MAY. 
3tPIOy-dtbs,446278,451817,THIS IS AN ONGOING THREAT TO  THE NATIONS DEMOCRACY THAT  TRUMP HAS ENDORSED A NUMBER OF  CANDIDATES WHO SAID THAT THEY   WOULD MOVE THEY WOULD HAVE DONE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,451817,459425,"WHAT HE WAS ASKING THEM TO DO,  WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY TO CREATE  A FAKE ELECTOR.   AT THAT THERE IS THIS ONGOING "
3tPIOy-dtbs,459425,466232,"THREAT.   AND ONGOING POLITICAL VIOLENCE  OVER THE WEEKEND.   ADAM, TALKING ABOUT THE THREATS   THAT HE HAS RECEIVED. I THINK,"

3tPIOy-dtbs,476976,483716,"SHAME IS A GEORGIA ELECTION   OFFICIAL WHO WILL TALK IN   PAINFUL DETAIL, I AM TOLD,  ABOUT THE THREATS THAT SHE  RECEIVED BECAUSE SHE REFUSED TO "
3tPIOy-dtbs,483716,489822,"DO WHAT TRUMP WAS ASKING HER TO   DO.?  I IMAGINE, WE HAVE HEARD THE  STORY FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA   REPUBLICANS IN PARTICULAR, I'LL "
3tPIOy-dtbs,489822,495962,"BE SURPRISED IF YOU DIDN'T SEE  VIDEO AT TESTIMONY OF FAMILY,   WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FOLKS IN   DETROIT, THE REPUBLICANS ON   THAT ONE.   WE ARE GOING BACK IN THE"
3tPIOy-dtbs,495962,503202,"TIMELINE.   WITH YOU KNOW, MIKE PENCE, MOST   OF THAT IS THE 72 HOURS UP"
3tPIOy-dtbs,503202,509108,"THROUGH JANUARY 6th.  NOW, WE ARE GOING BACK ALMOST   LIKE ANOTHER TWO WEEKS. "
3tPIOy-dtbs,509108,514580,JANUARY 2nd WAS A BIG DEAL.   THE PHONE CALL TO BRAD HERE.
3tPIOy-dtbs,514580,519617,"I THINK IT SHOWS, FIRST, HE IS  TRYING TO OVERTURN THE RESULT   THAN HE WAS TRYING TO FIND"
3tPIOy-dtbs,519617,526024,STATE LEGISLATURES TO DO IT AS  WELL.   THIS IS A MULTIFACETED PLAN HE
3tPIOy-dtbs,526024,532064,"TRIED TO PUT IN PLACE.?   CERTAINLY, LAWMAKERS REALLY   WANT TO HAVE A CLEAR NARRATIVE  FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING "
3tPIOy-dtbs,532064,537169,"THAT REALLY PAINTS A PICTURE OF   THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP  UNDERSTANDING, BEING TOLD OVER"
3tPIOy-dtbs,537169,544944,"AND OVER AGAIN, NOT JUST BY   LAWMAKERS, NOT JUST BY HIS OWN  SORT OF CAMPAIGN AIDE, BUT ALSO   BY THE STATE OFFICIALS WHO WERE "
3tPIOy-dtbs,544944,550816,"IN THE STATES WHERE VOTES ARE   BEING COUNTED, BEING TOLD YOU   LOST.   I THINK IT IS INTERESTING, WHEN   HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT "
3tPIOy-dtbs,550816,556956,"NOT ONLY ARISING FROM THE, THE  GEORGIA OFFICIALS, WE HAVE SEEN   A LOT OF NATIONAL ATTENTION.  BUT, MY EYE IS ON ARIZONA."
3tPIOy-dtbs,556956,563429,"IT REALLY DOES, IT REALLY MAKES   PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS   A WIDE-RANGING EFFORT TO TRY TO   GET PEOPLE TO OVERTURN THE"
3tPIOy-dtbs,563429,569835,ELECTION.   I THINK ABOUT NOVEMBER AND 2020   AND WHEN MICHIGAN OFFICIALS 
3tPIOy-dtbs,569835,575941,WERE CALLED THE WHITE HOUSE.  OUR MEMBER STANDING ON THE  WHITE HOUSE LAWN AND REALLY   HAVING TO REPORT ON ELECTION  OFFICIALS BEING SUMMONED TO THE   OVAL OFFICE BY THE FORMER 
3tPIOy-dtbs,575941,582348,PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BE PRESSURE
3tPIOy-dtbs,582348,588487,TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION.   IT IS INTERESTING WE ARE GOING  PAST THE FAMOUS STATE AND GOING   INTO OTHER STATES THAT REALLY   UNDERSTAND SORT OF WHAT IS AT 
3tPIOy-dtbs,588487,593559,"STAKE HERE.   EDDIE TALK ABOUT BRAD, HE IS  SOMEONE WHO IS, RIGHT NOW, A"
3tPIOy-dtbs,593559,599598,"POLITICAL ANOMALY.  HE IS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT THE  NORM IN THE REPUBLIC AND PARTY.   HE STOOD UP, HE WAS ABLE TO   KEEP HIS CP BUT, THERE WERE SO"
3tPIOy-dtbs,599598,606405,"MANY REPUBLICANS WHO WISH THEY  WERE WHERE BRAD IS, BUT WHO ARE   MUCH MORE, MUCH MORE VULNERABLE "
3tPIOy-dtbs,606405,612244,AS BEING TARGETED BY FORMER   PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHO COULD   NOT DO WHAT HE IS DOING.  >> THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN  HIM IN PUBLIC SINCE HE WON. 
3tPIOy-dtbs,612244,621454,"AND LOOK, I HAVE LITTLE TIME  WITH HIM INTERVIEWING HIM.  I THINK THE TV HAS, YOU CAN FEEL"
3tPIOy-dtbs,621454,627526,"THE, THE, THE, I COULD DUCK IN  ATLANTA, THE CAPITOL, YOU KNOW,   I RAN INTO HIM.   AND YOU COULD FEEL THE TENSION  HE WAS FEELING. "
3tPIOy-dtbs,627526,633833,"IT WAS SO UNDER SIEGE.  NOW THAT HE WON, HE CANNOT TELL   ME, YOU KNOW, HE IS SO CAREFUL  WITH HIS WORDS. "
3tPIOy-dtbs,633833,640539,"NOT THAT HE WON'T BE CAREFUL  TODAY, HE WILL BE AS NERVOUS  ABOUT SOMETHING BEING USED  AGAINST HIM BECAUSE SCOREBOARD. "
3tPIOy-dtbs,640539,645978,"HE WON.   >> HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY, I THINK   REFLECT FEELING LIBERATED FROM"
3tPIOy-dtbs,645978,654120,"THAT PRESSURE THAT HE WAS   UNDER, CHUCK.   AT THE SAME TIME, HE WOULD BE   ABLE TO SPEAK TO IT.  AND WILL BE ABLE TO COME IN "
3tPIOy-dtbs,654120,659525,"VERY PERSONAL TERMS, TALK ABOUT   WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE UNDER  SIEGE IN THAT WAY."
3tPIOy-dtbs,659525,664864,"I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE  POINT THAT HE IS MAKING, TO   POINT OUT THAT MORE THAN 100  GOP CANDIDATES HAVE WON THEIR "
3tPIOy-dtbs,664864,671771,PRIMARIES. CANDIDATES WHO   SUPPORT TRUMP SO-CALLED BIG   LIE.  AND SO HE IS CALLING ON 
3tPIOy-dtbs,671771,677843,"REPUBLICANS TO PUT THOSE TYPES  OF PEOPLE IN OFFICE.  AGAIN, THAT IS THE ONGOING"
3tPIOy-dtbs,677843,683248,THREAT THAT THE COMMITTEE IS  ARGUING STILL EXISTS.   >> YOU HAVE GONE THE OUTLINES   OF HOW THE FORMER PRESIDENT

3tPIOy-dtbs,701667,708574,"THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY THAT THE   DOJ IS GOING TO HAVE, WHICH IS  CAN YOU PROVE THAT HE KNEW HE "

3tPIOy-dtbs,745244,750749,"I THINK IT IS, OF COURSE, THE   THING TO BE AT THE HEART OF   THIS.   I ALSO THINK MONA COMES TO THE  DANGER, EVEN IF THIS IS "
3tPIOy-dtbs,750749,755387,CRIMINAL IN THE CAN'T PROVE   THAT HE BELIEVED HIS OWN LIFE   AND THAT HE WASN'T SOMEONE WHO  WAS BREAKING THE LAW ON   PURPOSE.

3tPIOy-dtbs,6804831,6814240,SUPERPOWER OF THE TRUMP   ADMINISTRATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN  THAT THEY WERE UNDERESTIMATED 
3tPIOy-dtbs,6814240,6819279,AND THEY CAN HAVE REAL IMPACT   AND GOING ALL THE WAY UP TO   WHEN HE WAS RUNNING BUT ALSO  WHILE IN OFFICE AND THERE WERE

3tPIOy-dtbs,7452711,7458751,GEORGIA INCLUDING RUDY GIULIANI   AND LAUNCHED A NEW CONSPIRACY   THEORY THAT WOULD TAKE ON A   LIFE OF ITS OWN AND THREATEN

3tPIOy-dtbs,7549141,7556448,SOCIAL MEDIA AND AS YOU CAN SEE   IN A TWEET HE WROTE THAT IT WAS   WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT FULTON

3tPIOy-dtbs,7585844,7592718,SHOW?   >> DEPENDING ON WHICH TIME YOU  WANT TO START BECAUSE THE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7592718,7597989,CONSPIRACY THEORY TOOK ON A   LIFE OF ITS OWN WHERE THEY  CONFLATED A WATER MAIN BREAK
3tPIOy-dtbs,7597989,7604496,AND THERE WASN'T A WATER MAIN   BREAK AND THROWING OBSERVERS  OUT AND WHAT IT SHOWED WAS  FULTON COUNTY ELECTION WORKERS
3tPIOy-dtbs,7604496,7616374,ENGAGING IN NORMAL BALLOT   PROCESSING AND ONE OF THE   SPECIFIC THINGS AND ONE OF THE
3tPIOy-dtbs,7616374,7622047,THINGS THAT WAS FRUSTRATING WAS   THE SO-CALLED SUITCASES THE   BALLOTS FROM UNDER THE TABLE  AND IF YOU WATCH THE ENTIRETY   OF THE VIDEO YOU SAW THAT THESE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7622047,7627786,WERE ELECTION WORKERS UNDER THE   IMPRESSION THEY WOULD GET TO GO   HOME AROUND 10:00 OR 10:30 PM   AND THEY'RE PUTTING BALLOTS 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7627786,7639698,INTO BALLOT CARRIERS THAT   SEALED THE TAMPERPROOF SEAL   THAT YOU CANNOT MESS WITH IT. 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7639698,7645137,AND IT'S AN INTERESTING THING   BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR SCREENS  OF THE VIDEO AND IS ARE   WATCHING IT YOU CAN SEE THE   ELECTION MONITORS ON THE CORNER 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7645137,7652511,"AS THEY ARE TAKING THESE  BALLOTS AND PUTTING THEM UNDER  THE TABLE, YOU SEE IT AND ONE "

3tPIOy-dtbs,7665757,7678036,IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE  SHUTTING DOWN THE FULTON COUNTY   COUNTY AND THE SECRETARY  EXPRESSED DISPLEASURE. OUR
3tPIOy-dtbs,7678036,7684276,ELECTIONS DIRECTOR CALLED THEIR   ELECTIONS DIRECTOR WHO WAS AT   ANOTHER LOCATION BECAUSE THIS   WAS ELECTION DAY AND THERE WAS
3tPIOy-dtbs,7684276,7691884,TWO PLACES WERE BALLOT THINGS   WERE BEING DONE.  SO HE CALLED AND THEN CALLED REF
3tPIOy-dtbs,7691884,7699258,RALPH JONES AND SAID WHATEVER 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7699258,7704396,"YOU'RE DOING, GO AHEAD AND STAY   AND IF YOU WATCH THE VIDEO YOU  SEE HIM TAKE THE PHONE CALL AS  PEOPLE ARE PUTTING THINGS AWAY"
3tPIOy-dtbs,7704396,7709500,AND GETTING READY TO LEAVE AND  FOR 15 OR 22nd HE DOESN'T WANT  TO TELL THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO   STAY AND HE WALKS OVER AND
3tPIOy-dtbs,7709500,7715240,THINKS ABOUT IT AND THEN SAYS   WE HAVE TO KEEP ON COUNTING AND 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7715240,7724483,"YOU SEE THEM TAKE THEIR COATS   OFF, GET THE BALLOTS OUT IN THE   SECONDARY THING IS YOU HAVE   PEOPLE WHO ARE COUNTING BALLOTS "
3tPIOy-dtbs,7724483,7731056,AND A BATCH WILL GO THROUGH AND   THEY TAKE THEM OFF AND RUN IT   THROUGH AGAIN AND WHAT HAPPENS  IS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE.
3tPIOy-dtbs,7731056,7736728,THESE ARE HIGH-SPEED AND HIGH-
3tPIOy-dtbs,7736728,7742301,CAPACITY SCANNERS SO THREE OR   FOUR WILL GO THROUGH AFTER A  MISSED SCAN AND THEY DELETE   THAT BATCH AND PUT IT BACK

3tPIOy-dtbs,7753579,7764356,THAN THE BALLOTS THEMSELVES AND   BY DOING THE HAND TALLY WE SAW  NUMBERS AND GOT US TO .1053%

3tPIOy-dtbs,7771797,7777502,ACADEMIC STUDY SAY YOU WILL   HAVE BETWEEN 1% AND 2% AND IT'S   VERY CLEAR WHAT THE VOTER 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7777502,7784610,INTENDED AND MADE IT EASIER TO  CONDUCT A HAND COUNT AND SHOW   NONE OF THAT WAS TRUE.
3tPIOy-dtbs,7784610,7790148,>> I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU   REVIEW THE TAPES AND DID THE  ANALYSIS THAT IT PROVED THE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7790148,7796354,CONSPIRACY THEORY.  BUT YOU STILL HAD TO TAKE A LOT   OF STEPS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE
3tPIOy-dtbs,7796354,7801593,THE PUBLIC KNEW THE TRUTH ABOUT   THE ALLEGATIONS AND FREQUENT  BRIEFINGS WITH THE PRESS.

3tPIOy-dtbs,7852344,7859217,AND THEY CHOSE TO MISLEAD STATE   SENATORS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT   WHAT WAS ON THE VIDEO.  I'M QUITE SURE THEY WILL NOT  CHARACTERIZE THE VIDEO AND TRY
3tPIOy-dtbs,7859217,7864890,TO ENTER INTO EVIDENCE BECAUSE  IT COULD LEAD TO SANCTIONS  BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNTRUE
3tPIOy-dtbs,7864890,7871163,AND THEY KNEW IT WAS UNTRUE.

3tPIOy-dtbs,7901927,7913038,WAS A RETICENCE OF PEOPLE WHO   NEEDED TO BELIEVE IT BECAUSE
3tPIOy-dtbs,7913038,7918310,THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED   STATES WAS TELLING THEM IT  WASN'T TRUE AND DESPITE THE   FACTS AND IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7918310,7925350,SHOVEL IN THE OCEAN AND IT WAS  FRUSTRATING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS 
3tPIOy-dtbs,7925350,7931723,WHO I HAD TO ARGUE WITH ABOUT   SOME OF THESE THINGS.   I WOULD SHOW THEM THINGS AND
3tPIOy-dtbs,7931723,7937696,THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE IS YOU GET   INTO PEOPLES HEARTS.  I REMEMBER ONE SPECIFIC ATTORNEY

3tPIOy-dtbs,8876934,8890614,"ELECTION FRAUD.   LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE TWEET.   THE TWEET READ, PRESIDENT TRUMP "
3tPIOy-dtbs,8890614,8896020,AT REAL DONALD TRUMP IS A   GENUINELY GOOD MAN.   HE DOES NOT REALLY LIKE TO FIRE   PEOPLE.   I BET HE DISLIKES PUTTING   PEOPLE IN JAIL ESPECIALLY QUOTE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,8896020,8901926,UNQUOTE REPUBLICANS AND GAVE  THE SECRETARY OF STATE EVERY  CHANCE TO GET IT RIGHT AND THEY   REFUSED AND THEY WILL SOON BE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,8901926,8908499,GOING TO JAIL.
3tPIOy-dtbs,8908499,8913937,SO ON YOUR CALL IT WAS NOT THE  FIRST TIME THE PRESIDENT  SUGGESTED HE MIGHT BE   CRIMINALLY LIABLE AND WITH THAT   LET'S LISTEN TO THIS PORTION OF 
3tPIOy-dtbs,8913937,8919009,THE CALL.   >> I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT   THEY ARE SHREDDING BALLOTS
3tPIOy-dtbs,8919009,8928185,BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GET RID OF   THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE UNSIGNED  AND ARE CORRUPT.
3tPIOy-dtbs,8928185,8934291,THEY ARE BRAND-NEW AND DO NOT   HAVE SEALS AND THERE'S A WHOLE  THING WITH THE BALLOTS BUT THE  BALLOTS ARE CORRUPT AND YOU   WILL FIND -- IT'S TOTALLY 
3tPIOy-dtbs,8934291,8939530,ILLEGAL AND MORE ILLEGAL FOR  YOU THAN IT IS FOR THEM BECAUSE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,8939530,8945369,YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID AND YOU  ARE NOT REPORTING IT AND THAT   IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE AND YOU 
3tPIOy-dtbs,8945369,8955946,"CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN.   THAT IS A BIG RISK TO YOU AND   TO RYAN, YOUR LAWYER. "
3tPIOy-dtbs,8955946,8961919,>> AFTER MAKING A FALSE CLAIM   ABOUT SHREDDING THE BALLOTS THE   PRESIDENT SUGGESTED THAT YOU  MAY BE COMMITTING A CRIME BY
3tPIOy-dtbs,8961919,8967825,"NOT GOING ALONG WITH HIS CLAIMS   OF ELECTION FRAUD AND AFTER   SUGGESTING YOU MIGHT HAVE   CRIMINAL EXPOSURE, PRESIDENT"
3tPIOy-dtbs,8967825,8973397,TRUMP MAKES THE MOST EXPLICIT   ASK OF THE CALL.  LET'S PLAY PART.
3tPIOy-dtbs,8997088,9002960,Was the president asking for  what he wanted?   >> What I knew is we didn't 
3tPIOy-dtbs,9002960,9010301,"have any votes to find.   We investigated, there were no  votes to find."
3tPIOy-dtbs,9010301,9020744,"That was an acrate count that   had been certified.   And as our General Counsel  said, there was no shredding of "
3tPIOy-dtbs,9020744,9025749,"pallets.  >> After making this request,   the president goes back to the  danger of having you deny these "
3tPIOy-dtbs,9025749,9035226,"allegations of fraud.   >> I watched you this morning,  and you said there was no "
3tPIOy-dtbs,9035226,9040230,criminality.  All of this is very dangerous   stuff.
3tPIOy-dtbs,9040230,9046337,"You talked about no   criminality, I think it's very  dangerous for you to say that.  >> You wrote about this in your "
3tPIOy-dtbs,9046337,9052042,book.   And you said I felt then and  still believe today that this 
3tPIOy-dtbs,9052042,9059416,"was a threat.   Others thought so too, because  some of his more radical"
3tPIOy-dtbs,9059416,9064755,"followers RESPONDED AS IF IT  WAS THEIR DUTY TO CARRY OUT   THIS.   PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU, YOUR "
3tPIOy-dtbs,9064755,9069793,WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAVE  EXPERIENCE REGARDING THREATS
3tPIOy-dtbs,9069793,9075599,FROM HIS MORE RADICAL

3tPIOy-dtbs,9084909,9092082,"YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE  MET IN HIGH SCHOOL, WE'VE BEEN  MARRIED OVER 40 YEARS."
3tPIOy-dtbs,9092082,9104662,THEY STARTED GOING AFTER HER TO   PUT PRESSURE ON ME. 
3tPIOy-dtbs,9104662,9109666,SOME PEOPLE BROKE INTO MY   DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S HOME. 
3tPIOy-dtbs,9109666,9119410,SO WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT   HER SAFETY ALSO.  >> WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST QUIT AND 
3tPIOy-dtbs,9119410,9131055,"WALK AWAY?  >> I KNEW WE HAD FOLLOWED THE   LAW AND FOLLOWED THE  CONSTITUTION, AND I THINK   SOMETIMES MORMONS REQUIRE YOU   TO STAND UP AND JUST TAKE THE "
3tPIOy-dtbs,9131055,9136193,"SHOTS.  JUST FOLLOW THE LAW AND FALL OF   THE CONSTITUTION.   AT THE END OF THE DAY,"
3tPIOy-dtbs,9136193,9143334,PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME UP SHORT   BUT I HAD TO BE FAITHFUL TO THE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,9143334,9148772,CONSTITUTION.   >> THE FORMER PRESIDENT   CONTINUED TO PRESS YOU TO FIND
3tPIOy-dtbs,9148772,9154844,REMAINING VOTES THAT WOULD  ENSURE HIS VICTORY IN GEORGIA.  >> WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO

3tPIOy-dtbs,11521009,11529050,I THINK WHAT LIZ CHENEY DID IS  FILL IN THE BLANKS ABOUT WHY  FUTURE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN 
3tPIOy-dtbs,11529050,11538626,UNSETTLED ON THE SCHEDULE.  THEY WANT HIM TO COME AND   TESTIFY.  I THINK TO BRING THAT PUBLIC IS 
3tPIOy-dtbs,11538626,11544332,AN EXTRAORDINARY STEP.

3tPIOy-dtbs,11709597,11717872,SO HE WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER   IN THESE HEARINGS.  THEY'VE BEEN GETTING MORE 
3tPIOy-dtbs,11717872,11724879,INFORMATION. BUT THIS WAS A

3tPIOy-dtbs,11801422,11812166,SO YOU DON'T HAVE A TRADITIONAL   RELATIONSHIP.   HIS CLIENT IS THE WHITE HOUSE.

3tPIOy-dtbs,11988176,11993714,TRAUMA CONTINUES.   THE STANDARD DEMOCRATIC
