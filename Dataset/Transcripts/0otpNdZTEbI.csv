0otpNdZTEbI,8639,11759,squint at the motorola motor edge 30 one
0otpNdZTEbI,11759,13759,of the more affordable of moldwell's

0otpNdZTEbI,15839,17760,400 pounds you could bag yourself a

0otpNdZTEbI,29199,31519,stabilization and all the trimmings but
0otpNdZTEbI,31519,32960,of course when it comes to mid-range
0otpNdZTEbI,32960,35440,mobiles in 2022 that area is very
0otpNdZTEbI,35440,37120,bloated indeed we've got likes the fresh

0otpNdZTEbI,42239,45120,on so is the moto edge 30 good enough to
0otpNdZTEbI,45120,46719,stand out from the rest of the crowd and
0otpNdZTEbI,46719,48480,warrant your cash well let's whip it on
0otpNdZTEbI,48480,50000,out of the box taking on a full-on tour
0otpNdZTEbI,50000,51360,and for more on the latest and greatest
0otpNdZTEbI,51360,52960,deck please do poke subscribe and ding
0otpNdZTEbI,52960,55120,that notifications bell cheers you see
0otpNdZTEbI,55120,56559,that was a bloody huge sentence and i
0otpNdZTEbI,56559,58239,didn't
0otpNdZTEbI,58239,59840,so first up what do you get stuffed
0otpNdZTEbI,59840,62160,inside of this rather sexy box you've
0otpNdZTEbI,62160,64400,got yourself one motorola model edge 30
0otpNdZTEbI,64400,66159,and actually comes pre-wrapped in a
0otpNdZTEbI,66159,68080,protective condom case you don't even
0otpNdZTEbI,68080,69600,have to worry about slapping it on
0otpNdZTEbI,69600,72479,yourself there's a 33 watt power adapter
0otpNdZTEbI,72479,74080,bundled in the box with the uh
0otpNdZTEbI,74080,75920,obligatory pop-up action if you like
0otpNdZTEbI,75920,78479,your cables you got one usb type-c
0otpNdZTEbI,78479,80400,effort stuffed in there too and you got
0otpNdZTEbI,80400,82560,some reading material as well
0otpNdZTEbI,82560,83759,and that's everything that's chucked
0otpNdZTEbI,83759,86320,away in there so hooray hooray let's get
0otpNdZTEbI,86320,88240,on with the video so here is the
0otpNdZTEbI,88240,91119,motorola moto edge 30. and i gotta say
0otpNdZTEbI,91119,92799,even from immediately pulling it out the
0otpNdZTEbI,92799,95439,box my first thoughts are wow this thing
0otpNdZTEbI,95439,97920,is crazy slim and light it's just 6.8
0otpNdZTEbI,97920,99759,millimeters from front to back and
0otpNdZTEbI,99759,100759,weighs just
0otpNdZTEbI,100759,103920,155 grams whereas most of its rivals are
0otpNdZTEbI,103920,105600,hitting more towards the sort of 200
0otpNdZTEbI,105600,108240,gram limit and yeah it's not exactly a
0otpNdZTEbI,108240,110159,compact smartphone it's still a mighty
0otpNdZTEbI,110159,112640,6.5 incher but it is quite comfortable
0otpNdZTEbI,112640,114880,to clutch helped along by the lack of
0otpNdZTEbI,114880,118320,girth does feel quite tall and slender
0otpNdZTEbI,118320,120079,not quite 21 by nine like sony's
0otpNdZTEbI,120079,121920,experienced smartphones but close it's
0otpNdZTEbI,121920,123759,just a shame that mode roller no longer
0otpNdZTEbI,123759,125280,offers the one-handed feature that it
0otpNdZTEbI,125280,127439,used to have packed inside of the moto
0otpNdZTEbI,127439,129440,app but never mind we'll explore all of
0otpNdZTEbI,129440,131039,this in a bit if you're a bit worried
0otpNdZTEbI,131039,133520,that 155 grams might make the moto edge
0otpNdZTEbI,133520,135680,30 feel a bit light a bit sort of toy
0otpNdZTEbI,135680,137520,like don't worry at all it's still got a
0otpNdZTEbI,137520,139120,reasonable heft to it it just doesn't
0otpNdZTEbI,139120,141120,feel absolutely brick like unlike a lot
0otpNdZTEbI,141120,143520,of its rival smartphones it really is
0otpNdZTEbI,143520,146160,very palm pleasing indeed as you can see
0otpNdZTEbI,146160,148480,there the 6.5 inch display pretty much
0otpNdZTEbI,148480,150080,fills the front end of the phone very
0otpNdZTEbI,150080,152080,skinny bezels which is great to see
0otpNdZTEbI,152080,154000,definitely helps with the hand feel as
0otpNdZTEbI,154000,156000,for the back end of the model edge 30
0otpNdZTEbI,156000,158400,well that's constructed from a pmma
0otpNdZTEbI,158400,161280,material and of course as we all know
0otpNdZTEbI,161280,165120,pmma stands for polymethyl methacrylate
0otpNdZTEbI,165120,167200,fun polymethyl methacrylate factor
0otpNdZTEbI,167200,168800,kitties that's actually used in the
0otpNdZTEbI,168800,170800,construction of false teeth so you'd
0otpNdZTEbI,170800,172160,kind of hope that the back end of the
0otpNdZTEbI,172160,174720,model age 30 would be proper tough
0otpNdZTEbI,174720,176080,certainly tough enough to chew through
0otpNdZTEbI,176080,178000,granny's buds and as you can see they've
0otpNdZTEbI,178000,179440,got a lovely matte finish on the back
0otpNdZTEbI,179440,181040,end of the model h30 which is always
0otpNdZTEbI,181040,183120,pleasing to see i can't stand glossy
0otpNdZTEbI,183120,185440,finishes because they smudge up so badly
0otpNdZTEbI,185440,187200,and yeah you've got a little bit of
0otpNdZTEbI,187200,188959,grease and grime on the back end here
0otpNdZTEbI,188959,190720,after i've been handling it for about
0otpNdZTEbI,190720,192239,half an hour or so but nothing too
0otpNdZTEbI,192239,194239,troublesome should be fine again after a
0otpNdZTEbI,194239,195920,good bit of buffing and this right here
0otpNdZTEbI,195920,198159,is the meteor grey model it's actually
0otpNdZTEbI,198159,200640,quite nice for something that's gray but
0otpNdZTEbI,200640,202400,you can also grab it in aurora green or
0otpNdZTEbI,202400,204400,super moon silver if you fancy something
0otpNdZTEbI,204400,206959,a bit lighter a bit cheerier we've also
0otpNdZTEbI,206959,210080,got ip52 splash resistance here so the
0otpNdZTEbI,210080,212319,moto edge 30 can get a bit moist without
0otpNdZTEbI,212319,214400,any mishaps but definitely don't go
0otpNdZTEbI,214400,216080,dunking it into a sink a bath or
0otpNdZTEbI,216080,217920,anything like that it wouldn't like that
0otpNdZTEbI,217920,219840,very much at all now one of the things i
0otpNdZTEbI,219840,221760,like the most about motorola blowers is
0otpNdZTEbI,221760,223200,you get this lovely stock version of
0otpNdZTEbI,223200,224400,android which for the most part is
0otpNdZTEbI,224400,226799,pretty smooth and satisfying to use
0otpNdZTEbI,226799,228400,there's of course the latest greatest
0otpNdZTEbI,228400,230080,android 12. you've got a couple of years
0otpNdZTEbI,230080,232080,of android os and security updates
0otpNdZTEbI,232080,234640,guaranteed by motorola so dive on into
0otpNdZTEbI,234640,236480,the moto edge 30s apps tree and you
0otpNdZTEbI,236480,238560,won't find it laden with all kinds of
0otpNdZTEbI,238560,241040,crap wear and like a lot of rivals it's
0otpNdZTEbI,241040,242560,basically just straight up google stuff
0otpNdZTEbI,242560,244319,and things that i've already downloaded
0otpNdZTEbI,244319,245360,and then you've got a couple of little
0otpNdZTEbI,245360,246480,bonus bits on there but they're
0otpNdZTEbI,246480,248480,generally quite helpful such as ready
0otpNdZTEbI,248480,250720,for this just allows you to connect your
0otpNdZTEbI,250720,253360,model device to a tv or a pc for
0otpNdZTEbI,253360,255439,instance to get a big screen experience
0otpNdZTEbI,255439,257440,on the fly this is pretty bloody easy to
0otpNdZTEbI,257440,259280,use especially if you go wireless as you
0otpNdZTEbI,259280,261280,can see there my lg tv has just popped
0otpNdZTEbI,261280,262960,up because it is connected to the same
0otpNdZTEbI,262960,265040,wifi network as the phones let's tap
0otpNdZTEbI,265040,266560,that and then as you can see here you
0otpNdZTEbI,266560,268720,can actually use your smartphone as a
0otpNdZTEbI,268720,270720,track pad so you can navigate through
0otpNdZTEbI,270720,273280,the menu like so with swipes and taps
0otpNdZTEbI,273280,274320,and you've got all kinds of different
0otpNdZTEbI,274320,276000,modes you've got your standard desktop
0otpNdZTEbI,276000,277520,mode like source you can load up all of
0otpNdZTEbI,277520,278639,your apps and have a play around with
0otpNdZTEbI,278639,279680,them otherwise if you go on the
0otpNdZTEbI,279680,281440,experience hub you've got all these
0otpNdZTEbI,281440,283759,separate sections gaming video chat tv
0otpNdZTEbI,283759,285440,and mobile desktop so whatever you're in
0otpNdZTEbI,285440,286880,the mood for you can get it on the go
0otpNdZTEbI,286880,288320,you can watch good bit netflix just
0otpNdZTEbI,288320,290000,streaming it to your telly whether
0otpNdZTEbI,290000,291520,there's any other streaming services
0otpNdZTEbI,291520,293120,that you use you can actually add all
0otpNdZTEbI,293120,295120,the apps you need to and boom it's as
0otpNdZTEbI,295120,296720,easy as that time to sack off the rest
0otpNdZTEbI,296720,297840,of the afternoon and watch doctor
0otpNdZTEbI,297840,299759,strange all the other bonus mode roller
0otpNdZTEbI,299759,301120,features are generally packed away
0otpNdZTEbI,301120,303360,inside of the moto experiences app you
0otpNdZTEbI,303360,304880,can find a lot of this stuff also buried
0otpNdZTEbI,304880,306240,away in the settings but it's all here
0otpNdZTEbI,306240,308000,in one handy hub so you can quickly and
0otpNdZTEbI,308000,309840,easily personalize your smartphone and
0otpNdZTEbI,309840,312000,change up the icon colors the fonts all
0otpNdZTEbI,312000,313840,kinds of shenanigans the color scheme
0otpNdZTEbI,313840,315280,can be taken directly from your
0otpNdZTEbI,315280,317600,wallpaper otherwise you can custom fit
0otpNdZTEbI,317600,319440,it to provide whatever kind of colors
0otpNdZTEbI,319440,321680,you want nice bit of blue very charming
0otpNdZTEbI,321680,322960,the only thing i've been struggling with
0otpNdZTEbI,322960,324320,here on the moto age 30 is the
0otpNdZTEbI,324320,326560,wallpapers namely set in my own desktops
0otpNdZTEbI,326560,328280,that i've downloaded from
0otpNdZTEbI,328280,329919,wall.alphacoders.com so for instance if
0otpNdZTEbI,329919,331120,i try selecting something it just
0otpNdZTEbI,331120,333039,crashes back to this section means i
0otpNdZTEbI,333039,334800,have to do the ball lake method of doing
0otpNdZTEbI,334800,336080,it which basically involves going into
0otpNdZTEbI,336080,337520,files and then selecting it and then
0otpNdZTEbI,337520,340240,going to use as wallpaper etc that weird
0otpNdZTEbI,340240,342160,little quirk aside it's all good you got
0otpNdZTEbI,342160,344240,the same excellent gesture support so
0otpNdZTEbI,344240,345520,for instance you can quick load the
0otpNdZTEbI,345520,348160,camera with quick double wrist twists oh
0otpNdZTEbI,348160,349600,gesture which gets harder and harder
0otpNdZTEbI,349600,351520,with every motor or the phone iron unbox
0otpNdZTEbI,351520,353280,and of course yes the moment you've all
0otpNdZTEbI,353280,354960,been waiting for and that i've been
0otpNdZTEbI,354960,358560,waiting for my personal favorite
0otpNdZTEbI,358560,360080,and from inside this app you can also
0otpNdZTEbI,360080,362400,mess around with likes the dolby atmos
0otpNdZTEbI,362400,364400,sound settings and select between the
0otpNdZTEbI,364400,366479,various presets and inside the section
0otpNdZTEbI,366479,369120,you'll also find motorola's gaming tools
0otpNdZTEbI,369120,372319,but more on all of that in a bit
0otpNdZTEbI,372319,373680,sorry not really sure why i made that
0otpNdZTEbI,373680,375520,noise it's late afternoon and i've had
0otpNdZTEbI,375520,377120,far too much coffee so i'm ever so
0otpNdZTEbI,377120,379120,slightly worried for your security
0otpNdZTEbI,379120,380800,shenanigans you've got an in-display
0otpNdZTEbI,380800,383120,fingerprint sensor here on the moto edge
0otpNdZTEbI,383120,385520,30 and it's positioned quite low down as
0otpNdZTEbI,385520,387120,you can see there so not the most
0otpNdZTEbI,387120,389199,comfortable to use but not terrible and
0otpNdZTEbI,389199,391039,it is just your basic optical scanner as
0otpNdZTEbI,391039,392400,you would expect at this sort of price
0otpNdZTEbI,392400,394800,point and so far touchwood seems pretty
0otpNdZTEbI,394800,396720,responsive doesn't take forever
0otpNdZTEbI,396720,398639,recognizing who you are but also seems
0otpNdZTEbI,398639,400639,to recognize you on the first tap which
0otpNdZTEbI,400639,402639,is always a bonus and on the storage tip
0otpNdZTEbI,402639,405759,you've got a choice for 128 or 256 gigs
0otpNdZTEbI,405759,407520,of internal space as you can see this is
0otpNdZTEbI,407520,409440,the one to eight gig model and sadly
0otpNdZTEbI,409440,411199,there is bugger all space for a micro sd
0otpNdZTEbI,411199,412880,memory card inside that symmetry even
0otpNdZTEbI,412880,414479,though it is a double sided just spits
0otpNdZTEbI,414479,416800,with two sims that's it i gotta say i am
0otpNdZTEbI,416800,419199,rather enamored with that 6.5 inch
0otpNdZTEbI,419199,422080,amoled display it is a proper beauty you
0otpNdZTEbI,422080,423759,got nice wide viewing angles seems
0otpNdZTEbI,423759,425440,pretty punchy on that top brightness
0otpNdZTEbI,425440,428080,level as well seriously deep blacks nice
0otpNdZTEbI,428080,430000,sharp contrast in fact you got hdr 10
0otpNdZTEbI,430000,431919,plus stream and support on this thing as
0otpNdZTEbI,431919,434319,well nice poppy colors as well but
0otpNdZTEbI,434319,436080,visuals are pleasingly natural and
0otpNdZTEbI,436080,437599,realistic when you're streaming the
0otpNdZTEbI,437599,440160,likes of hdr content it's a full hd plus
0otpNdZTEbI,440160,441840,screen so plenty of detail packed in
0otpNdZTEbI,441840,443280,there for your photos your videos
0otpNdZTEbI,443280,445440,whatever you happen to be up to and yeah
0otpNdZTEbI,445440,447039,the selfie orifice is centrally
0otpNdZTEbI,447039,448960,positioned and not the smallest i've
0otpNdZTEbI,448960,451360,ever seen which yeah it does intrude on
0otpNdZTEbI,451360,452800,the action when you go full view but
0otpNdZTEbI,452800,455039,nothing too horrendous you got a lot of
0otpNdZTEbI,455039,456720,controls to muck around with here in the
0otpNdZTEbI,456720,458319,display settings you've got the likes of
0otpNdZTEbI,458319,459680,the night light just to make things
0otpNdZTEbI,459680,461360,easier on the eye in the evenings by
0otpNdZTEbI,461360,462880,filtering blue light you can actually
0otpNdZTEbI,462880,464720,change up the color reproduction as well
0otpNdZTEbI,464720,466479,you got flicker prevention and all those
0otpNdZTEbI,466479,468240,gestures we were going through earlier
0otpNdZTEbI,468240,469599,and then also you can tinker with the
0otpNdZTEbI,469599,471440,display refresh rate which as you can
0otpNdZTEbI,471440,473360,see there is set to dynamic you can
0otpNdZTEbI,473360,475919,boost it up to 144 hertz the maximum
0otpNdZTEbI,475919,478240,refresh rate full time if you like and
0otpNdZTEbI,478240,480479,certainly the ui feels nice and nippy
0otpNdZTEbI,480479,481759,and when you're opening apps as well
0otpNdZTEbI,481759,483440,they just pop up in a lovely smooth
0otpNdZTEbI,483440,485360,fashion and then like many other
0otpNdZTEbI,485360,486720,mid-ranges around this sort of price
0otpNdZTEbI,486720,489199,point the moto h30 rocks a stereo
0otpNdZTEbI,489199,491039,speaker setup we're talking a proper
0otpNdZTEbI,491039,493039,dedicated bottom mounted speaker here on
0otpNdZTEbI,493039,494639,this bottom edge and then also the
0otpNdZTEbI,494639,497599,earpiece speaker up top so does it not
0otpNdZTEbI,497599,499759,suck not quite the absolute best as far
0otpNdZTEbI,499759,501759,as true wireless earbuds go like the
0otpNdZTEbI,501759,504240,sony xm4s for instance definitely and
0otpNdZTEbI,504240,505680,wow bloody yell that's got actually a
0otpNdZTEbI,505680,507280,bit more power than i expected on that
0otpNdZTEbI,507280,508560,maxed out volume that would be
0otpNdZTEbI,508560,510160,absolutely perfect for watching a video
0otpNdZTEbI,510160,511759,or whatever in a really noisy
0otpNdZTEbI,511759,513518,environment kids screaming all around
0otpNdZTEbI,513518,515039,you give it a soft play or something
0otpNdZTEbI,515039,517440,like that although as you may expect
0otpNdZTEbI,517440,518560,that bottom mounted speaker
0otpNdZTEbI,518560,520000,unfortunately he has a bit more grunt
0otpNdZTEbI,520000,522080,compared with the tinny little earpiece
0otpNdZTEbI,522080,523599,speaker up top cause you've got that
0otpNdZTEbI,523599,525040,dolby atmos tuning which i showed you
0otpNdZTEbI,525040,526880,earlier and a bit of bluetooth 5.2
0otpNdZTEbI,526880,528480,support if you want to stream some audio
0otpNdZTEbI,528480,530480,to some headphones instead it's highly
0otpNdZTEbI,530480,532080,recommended actually in a soft play
0otpNdZTEbI,532080,534959,environment but no headphone jack boo
0otpNdZTEbI,534959,537519,now powering the motorola moto edge 30
0otpNdZTEbI,537519,541040,is qualcomm snapdragon 778 g plus
0otpNdZTEbI,541040,543120,chipset and not quite as much grunt as
0otpNdZTEbI,543120,544640,some rivals around this price point
0otpNdZTEbI,544640,547200,likes the oneplus nord 2t and the poco
0otpNdZTEbI,547200,548959,f4 which i just reviewed that's backed
0otpNdZTEbI,548959,550959,by the 6 or 8 gigs of ram i got the 8
0otpNdZTEbI,550959,553200,gig model right here but still very
0otpNdZTEbI,553200,554959,respectable everyday performance because
0otpNdZTEbI,554959,556480,of course you've got that stock android
0otpNdZTEbI,556480,558399,finish there's no clunky launches sat on
0otpNdZTEbI,558399,560880,top weighing it down apps they just load
0otpNdZTEbI,560880,563040,up straight away no worries whatsoever
0otpNdZTEbI,563040,565040,nor funny and about so certainly
0otpNdZTEbI,565040,567120,everyday users should be satisfied and
0otpNdZTEbI,567120,568640,if you are a gamer as well you should be
0otpNdZTEbI,568640,570080,more than happy with the performance
0otpNdZTEbI,570080,572480,here depending on of course what games
0otpNdZTEbI,572480,575120,you actually like to play i briefly
0otpNdZTEbI,575120,577040,teased modal's gaming tools earlier
0otpNdZTEbI,577040,578720,which you can access at any point in
0otpNdZTEbI,578720,580399,game by dragging out otherwise you can
0otpNdZTEbI,580399,582320,also get a little on-screen icon which
0otpNdZTEbI,582320,584560,you just tap to bring up the menu this
0otpNdZTEbI,584560,586320,is well worth checking out because it
0otpNdZTEbI,586320,588160,allows you to for instance record the
0otpNdZTEbI,588160,589760,action if you're into a bit of all of
0otpNdZTEbI,589760,591200,that you've got the high performance
0otpNdZTEbI,591200,593279,mode as well this helps dedicate those
0otpNdZTEbI,593279,595360,valuable resources to your game you can
0otpNdZTEbI,595360,597600,also visually block any calls and any
0otpNdZTEbI,597600,599680,other notifications as well so you're
0otpNdZTEbI,599680,601760,not interrupted in the middle of a game
0otpNdZTEbI,601760,603360,so while the gaming toolset isn't quite
0otpNdZTEbI,603360,605040,as fully featured as some rivals the
0otpNdZTEbI,605040,607200,likes of color os for instance it's
0otpNdZTEbI,607200,609040,still pretty good for you know what was
0otpNdZTEbI,609040,610959,a reasonably stock android smartphone
0otpNdZTEbI,610959,613120,and yeah i really enjoyed shredding a
0otpNdZTEbI,613120,615120,few random strangers pancreases and the
0otpNdZTEbI,615120,617839,likes of call of duty mobile certainly
0otpNdZTEbI,617839,619440,played very nicely here indeed on the
0otpNdZTEbI,619440,621920,moto h30 the screen feels pleasingly
0otpNdZTEbI,621920,623920,responsive gives you a nice big fat view
0otpNdZTEbI,623920,625920,of the action and the frame rate stayed
0otpNdZTEbI,625920,628160,really stable even on the highest detail
0otpNdZTEbI,628160,630000,settings did notice after a couple of
0otpNdZTEbI,630000,631279,games that the back end of the phone
0otpNdZTEbI,631279,632560,start to heat up a little bit towards
0otpNdZTEbI,632560,634560,the top end where the camera is however
0otpNdZTEbI,634560,635760,and also the point where i started to
0otpNdZTEbI,635760,637360,like throttle the action or anything i
0otpNdZTEbI,637360,638959,like that the frame rate stayed stable
0otpNdZTEbI,638959,640399,the performance stayed good what
0otpNdZTEbI,640399,642399,definitely did test this phone out a bit
0otpNdZTEbI,642399,644800,more was a solid but a gentian impact
0otpNdZTEbI,644800,646480,action again this played better than i
0otpNdZTEbI,646480,648480,thought it would just on the standard me
0otpNdZTEbI,648480,650959,medium to law detail settings you see
0otpNdZTEbI,650959,652560,the occasional tiny little judder or
0otpNdZTEbI,652560,654160,stumble but nothing too bad at all it's
0otpNdZTEbI,654160,656079,perfectly playable however of course if
0otpNdZTEbI,656079,657920,you do try and bump up the detail levels
0otpNdZTEbI,657920,659519,then yes you will start to see some
0otpNdZTEbI,659519,661360,serious drops in frame rate so i'd
0otpNdZTEbI,661360,663760,recommend not doing that and again the
0otpNdZTEbI,663760,665920,back end of that handset towards the top
0otpNdZTEbI,665920,667440,of where the camera chassis is it
0otpNdZTEbI,667440,669440,started to get pretty toasty after just
0otpNdZTEbI,669440,672240,about 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay so
0otpNdZTEbI,672240,673760,probably not the best if you want a
0otpNdZTEbI,673760,675839,smartphone to game on vino two or three
0otpNdZTEbI,675839,678000,hours at a time and as well as a tasty
0otpNdZTEbI,678000,680240,bit of sub 65g action the mod roll the
0otpNdZTEbI,680240,683120,moto h30 also comes packing wi-fi 6e
0otpNdZTEbI,683120,685600,support so nice nippy connectivity and
0otpNdZTEbI,685600,687200,the battery life seems pretty bloody
0otpNdZTEbI,687200,688880,good on this motor blower as well
0otpNdZTEbI,688880,690800,despite the fact that the cell packed
0otpNdZTEbI,690800,692640,inside of that rather skinny chassis is
0otpNdZTEbI,692640,694560,smaller than most of its rivals it's a 4
0otpNdZTEbI,694560,697360,020 milliamp capacity battery but the
0otpNdZTEbI,697360,699200,good news is that since i fully charged
0otpNdZTEbI,699200,700800,this i've had the screen on for almost
0otpNdZTEbI,700800,702480,two full hours been playing a good bit
0otpNdZTEbI,702480,704160,of call of duty i've been streaming some
0otpNdZTEbI,704160,705519,disney plus and showing off all the
0otpNdZTEbI,705519,707120,various features and the batteries only
0otpNdZTEbI,707120,709040,drained to 74 percent now that's
0otpNdZTEbI,709040,710880,probably helped by a combination of the
0otpNdZTEbI,710880,712320,fact you've got a pretty stock version
0otpNdZTEbI,712320,714000,of android on here no clunky heavy
0otpNdZTEbI,714000,716160,launchers no other apps sucking up juice
0otpNdZTEbI,716160,718880,in the background all nefarious like and
0otpNdZTEbI,718880,720959,also the fact that the snapdragon 778
0otpNdZTEbI,720959,723040,chipset is pretty energy efficient and
0otpNdZTEbI,723040,725040,when it is time to power the moto h30
0otpNdZTEbI,725040,726800,back up what you got support for 30
0otpNdZTEbI,726800,729360,watts turbo power not quite as turbo as
0otpNdZTEbI,729360,730800,some of the other modular phones that
0otpNdZTEbI,730800,733200,i've fondled for instance the moto g60s
0otpNdZTEbI,733200,735120,i think it was supported 50 watt fast
0otpNdZTEbI,735120,736959,charging but you know it's not bad at
0otpNdZTEbI,736959,738560,all and unfortunately you don't get any
0otpNdZTEbI,738560,740079,wireless charging support here but
0otpNdZTEbI,740079,742240,that's pretty typical for a smartphone
0otpNdZTEbI,742240,744240,around this sort of price point and last
0otpNdZTEbI,744240,745839,up the camera tech and what you have
0otpNdZTEbI,745839,748079,here is a triple lens setup spearheaded
0otpNdZTEbI,748079,750399,by a 50 megapixel primary sensor with
0otpNdZTEbI,750399,752560,optical image stabilization built in
0otpNdZTEbI,752560,753920,which one is it i don't really know i'm
0otpNdZTEbI,753920,755200,just going to point at all of them
0otpNdZTEbI,755200,756959,probably that one now i really like the
0otpNdZTEbI,756959,758480,mod roller camera app which is
0otpNdZTEbI,758480,761120,pleasingly easy to use one-handed as you
0otpNdZTEbI,761120,762399,can see there you can drag down all of
0otpNdZTEbI,762399,764240,the main camera settings from anywhere
0otpNdZTEbI,764240,766639,on screen and quickly flick between all
0otpNdZTEbI,766639,768800,of the various different camera modes of
0otpNdZTEbI,768800,770079,which there are many you think that
0otpNdZTEbI,770079,771600,there's quite a few and then you get to
0otpNdZTEbI,771600,774320,more and it's like oh my god anyway head
0otpNdZTEbI,774320,776560,to the main photo mode in full auto and
0otpNdZTEbI,776560,778320,it's got those ai smarts built in so it
0otpNdZTEbI,778320,780079,will suggest switching to a different
0otpNdZTEbI,780079,782079,mode if appropriate so for instance good
0otpNdZTEbI,782079,784399,bit of portrait when it detects a human
0otpNdZTEbI,784399,786160,face like good old veronica here and
0otpNdZTEbI,786160,787360,it's all very easy to use but you've got
0otpNdZTEbI,787360,788959,plenty of customization in there as well
0otpNdZTEbI,788959,790480,so for instance you can change up the
0otpNdZTEbI,790480,792079,level of the bokeh effect in the
0otpNdZTEbI,792079,793920,portrait mode and you can also quickly
0otpNdZTEbI,793920,795440,and easily swap between the two main
0otpNdZTEbI,795440,797360,lenses the 50 megapixel primary sensor
0otpNdZTEbI,797360,799760,and the 50 megapixel ultra wide angle
0otpNdZTEbI,799760,802000,shooter there isn't a macro lens on here
0otpNdZTEbI,802000,803360,that just uses the ultra wide angle
0otpNdZTEbI,803360,805360,shooter as well just gonna get really
0otpNdZTEbI,805360,806959,close and personal for that one the
0otpNdZTEbI,806959,808720,third and final lens is actually a basic
0otpNdZTEbI,808720,810959,depth sensor for your portrait mode if
0otpNdZTEbI,810959,812720,you know your way around a dslr you've
0otpNdZTEbI,812720,814240,also got a full-on pro mode which you
0otpNdZTEbI,814240,815200,can shoot
0otpNdZTEbI,815200,817839,raw images in or just jpegs or both if
0otpNdZTEbI,817839,819600,you like and then all of motorola's
0otpNdZTEbI,819600,821360,usual bonus baits include a dedicated
0otpNdZTEbI,821360,823360,night vision mode but a spot color of
0otpNdZTEbI,823360,824959,course if you haven't used this before
0otpNdZTEbI,824959,826560,this allows you to highlight just one
0otpNdZTEbI,826560,828480,color and drain the rest of the picture
0otpNdZTEbI,828480,830240,so it's black and white you've also got
0otpNdZTEbI,830240,833040,an ultra red 50 megapixel mode as well
0otpNdZTEbI,833040,834480,in case you want to shoot a snap and
0otpNdZTEbI,834480,836800,then crop in digitally just to get a
0otpNdZTEbI,836800,838639,kind of a zoom effect just not quite as
0otpNdZTEbI,838639,840079,good and i believe it's four in one
0otpNdZTEbI,840079,842000,pixel bin and used by the moto h30 so
0otpNdZTEbI,842000,844079,when you do shoot away in standard auto
0otpNdZTEbI,844079,846959,mode you will be snapping 12.5 megapixel
0otpNdZTEbI,846959,848800,images and here's just a few test shots
0otpNdZTEbI,848800,850480,that i snapped around the homestead over
0otpNdZTEbI,850480,852240,the course of about 24 hours just to
0otpNdZTEbI,852240,854399,give you an idea of how the moto edge 30
0otpNdZTEbI,854399,856079,handles different kinds of light
0otpNdZTEbI,856079,857920,different conditions and as you can see
0otpNdZTEbI,857920,860480,on the whole quite nice finely detailed
0otpNdZTEbI,860480,862800,picks uh not too troubled by strong
0otpNdZTEbI,862800,865279,saturation really sharp contrast things
0otpNdZTEbI,865279,867120,like that in low light yes you do get a
0otpNdZTEbI,867120,868480,bit of noise creeping in and you want
0otpNdZTEbI,868480,870079,your subjects to be as still as possible
0otpNdZTEbI,870079,873519,but otherwise pretty decent
0otpNdZTEbI,876399,877600,if you like to shoot lots of horror
0otpNdZTEbI,877600,879360,movies while you can shoot away in
0otpNdZTEbI,879360,881680,either full hd resolution otherwise
0otpNdZTEbI,881680,884480,you've also got a 4k option if you like
0otpNdZTEbI,884480,885839,and if you dive on into the video
0otpNdZTEbI,885839,887519,settings you see at 4k level you've also
0otpNdZTEbI,887519,889680,got the option of turning on the hdr10
0otpNdZTEbI,889680,891839,setting and again here's just some basic
0otpNdZTEbI,891839,893680,footage i snapped around the homestead
0otpNdZTEbI,893680,896000,of my fuzzy little buddies here
0otpNdZTEbI,896000,897600,thankfully this was shortly before they
0otpNdZTEbI,897600,899360,discovered a mouse and then absolutely
0otpNdZTEbI,899360,900800,tore it to shreds that would have been
0otpNdZTEbI,900800,903040,definitely not particularly pg friendly
0otpNdZTEbI,903040,904720,and then last up around front there is a
0otpNdZTEbI,904720,908079,32 megapixel selfie shooter which again
0otpNdZTEbI,908079,909680,seems pretty bang on the money when it
0otpNdZTEbI,909680,911519,comes to just basic simple shareable
0otpNdZTEbI,911519,913519,shots again seems to cope pretty well
0otpNdZTEbI,913519,915360,with strong lightens no worries if
0otpNdZTEbI,915360,916639,you're trying to snap yourself against a
0otpNdZTEbI,916639,918720,bright sky or whatever and in low light
0otpNdZTEbI,918720,920639,not bad at all either and the model edge
0otpNdZTEbI,920639,922160,30 should be pretty good if you fancy
0otpNdZTEbI,922160,924000,yourself as a bit of a vlogger as well
0otpNdZTEbI,924000,925279,because you can shoot yourself again in
0otpNdZTEbI,925279,928959,gloriously crisp ultra hd 4k resolution
0otpNdZTEbI,928959,930560,and the image stays pretty sharp even
0otpNdZTEbI,930560,932160,when you're indoors not much noise
0otpNdZTEbI,932160,934320,introduced audio pickups pretty clear as
0otpNdZTEbI,934320,935680,well and there you have it my wee
0otpNdZTEbI,935680,937360,beauties that in a nutshell is the fresh
0otpNdZTEbI,937360,940399,new motorola moto edge 30 smartphone a
0otpNdZTEbI,940399,942160,pretty strong rival to likes the oneplus
0otpNdZTEbI,942160,945360,nord 2t the samsung galaxy a53 the slew
0otpNdZTEbI,945360,946880,of other mid-range mobiles that have hit
0otpNdZTEbI,946880,949440,in 2022 i like the media chops i like
0otpNdZTEbI,949440,951279,the camera tech the performance while
0otpNdZTEbI,951279,953440,not quite as powerful as some of its
0otpNdZTEbI,953440,954399,rivals
