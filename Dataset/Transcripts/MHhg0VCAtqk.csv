MHhg0VCAtqk,0,1860,- This could be the most important piece
MHhg0VCAtqk,1860,3780,of gear that I take with me when I travel
MHhg0VCAtqk,3780,6330,and thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this video.
MHhg0VCAtqk,6330,9510,So every device nowadays takes a different port to charge
MHhg0VCAtqk,9510,11880,"with micro USB, USBC lighting."
MHhg0VCAtqk,11880,13860,"And whenever we travel, I have to remember"
MHhg0VCAtqk,13860,16350,to bring all different types of cables.
MHhg0VCAtqk,16350,18930,"A true story, the last time we were in Mexico, I had to walk"
MHhg0VCAtqk,18930,21810,around the pool and look for someone who's using a Kindle.
MHhg0VCAtqk,21810,24449,So I could ask to borrow their micro USB cable
MHhg0VCAtqk,24450,25800,to charge our Kindle.
MHhg0VCAtqk,25800,28410,"Now, in addition to all the cables that I bring with me,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,28410,30008,I make sure that I have at least one
MHhg0VCAtqk,30008,34530,of these universal charging cables that has a micro USB tip
MHhg0VCAtqk,34530,38070,and then a removable tip with lightning and USBC.
MHhg0VCAtqk,38070,40200,"This cable doesn't give me the fastest charging,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,40200,41850,but it's super versatile.
MHhg0VCAtqk,41850,43890,I know that I have all my bases covered
MHhg0VCAtqk,43890,45930,and I highly recommend using it.
MHhg0VCAtqk,45930,48480,Now I'm going to show you a lot of gear in this video.
MHhg0VCAtqk,48480,51210,So another critical component is your bag
MHhg0VCAtqk,51210,54420,and I'm specifically looking at it from a tech perspective.
MHhg0VCAtqk,54420,56070,So I have three requirements.
MHhg0VCAtqk,56070,57780,The first is access.
MHhg0VCAtqk,57780,59699,I'm going to have a lot of things in this bag
MHhg0VCAtqk,59700,60990,and I don't wanna have to dig
MHhg0VCAtqk,60990,62610,through to the bottom to find something
MHhg0VCAtqk,62610,64650,or have to take everything outta the bag
MHhg0VCAtqk,64650,66660,because I can't reach something that I want.
MHhg0VCAtqk,66660,69330,So this is the peak design everyday backpack.
MHhg0VCAtqk,69330,72330,You can open it from both sides and from the top.
MHhg0VCAtqk,72330,75960,So you can always quickly and easily reach your gear.
MHhg0VCAtqk,75960,77940,"It also has a compartment at the top,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,77940,79890,which I use all the time for my phone
MHhg0VCAtqk,79890,82710,and other small things that I need quick access to.
MHhg0VCAtqk,82710,84852,And this pocket is definitely something that I miss
MHhg0VCAtqk,84852,87060,in some of my other bags.
MHhg0VCAtqk,87060,89549,And it's a feature that adds a lot of convenience.
MHhg0VCAtqk,89550,92460,The second requirement is organization and flexibility
MHhg0VCAtqk,92460,94650,and they sort of go hand in hand.
MHhg0VCAtqk,94650,96900,This bag has a ton of pockets and zippers.
MHhg0VCAtqk,96900,99390,So I can find a place for everything that I need.
MHhg0VCAtqk,99390,103380,It also has baffles that could be removed or moved around
MHhg0VCAtqk,103380,106350,so I can configure it to fit everything that I want.
MHhg0VCAtqk,106350,108720,"Now, the third requirement is protection."
MHhg0VCAtqk,108720,110850,"So this bag is really well built,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,110850,113040,the shell is super durable.
MHhg0VCAtqk,113040,114660,I've had it for over four years
MHhg0VCAtqk,114660,118110,and it pretty much looks exactly how he did when I got it.
MHhg0VCAtqk,118110,119488,There's also a good amount of padding.
MHhg0VCAtqk,119488,122580,There are dedicated laptop and tablet slots in the back
MHhg0VCAtqk,122580,124410,and you can loop the zipper pulls
MHhg0VCAtqk,124410,125610,"through the carrying loops,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,125610,128250,which prevents the zippers from being opened.
MHhg0VCAtqk,128250,130449,One thing that I always have with me is headphones
MHhg0VCAtqk,130449,133170,and they sort of fall into two categories.
MHhg0VCAtqk,133170,136230,So the first is a smaller in-ear model
MHhg0VCAtqk,136230,138209,that I can quickly pop in and out.
MHhg0VCAtqk,138210,141060,I can fit the small charging case in my pocket
MHhg0VCAtqk,141060,143010,and it lets me always have them charge
MHhg0VCAtqk,143010,144810,and they work great when I'm working out.
MHhg0VCAtqk,144810,147270,There's a lot of great options out there and I'll link
MHhg0VCAtqk,147270,149670,to a few of my favorites in the description.
MHhg0VCAtqk,149670,153090,"Now, if you want a much more immersive audio experience,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,153090,156569,then you should check out the Sony WH-1000 XM5
MHhg0VCAtqk,156570,158250,"at today's sponsor, Best Buy."
MHhg0VCAtqk,158250,160410,These are a great option for travel.
MHhg0VCAtqk,160410,163410,They have a really comfortable headband and soft ear cups
MHhg0VCAtqk,163410,165750,so you can wear them during long trips.
MHhg0VCAtqk,165750,166583,They have some of
MHhg0VCAtqk,166583,169439,the absolute best active noise cancellation.
MHhg0VCAtqk,169440,171570,"So if you're on a plane or at the airport,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,171570,172945,you can just turn on noise cancellation
MHhg0VCAtqk,172945,175950,and the outside world fades into the background.
MHhg0VCAtqk,175950,178440,And you can just listen to your music or movies.
MHhg0VCAtqk,178440,180540,"If you need to hear what's going on around you,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,180540,182579,"you can activate ambient sound mode,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,182580,185076,which will actually use the microphones to listen
MHhg0VCAtqk,185076,188070,and then send the audio into your headphones.
MHhg0VCAtqk,188070,190590,You can also cover the right ear cup with your hand
MHhg0VCAtqk,190590,192720,to temporarily let an outside noise in
MHhg0VCAtqk,192720,195690,and then lower the volume of what you're listening to.
MHhg0VCAtqk,195690,197250,"And with speak to chat,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,197250,199172,you can have the headphones actually listen
MHhg0VCAtqk,199172,202573,"and detect when you're talking, which will pause your music,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,202573,204569,"bring in the outside sound,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,204570,207150,and will allow you to have a conversation with someone.
MHhg0VCAtqk,207150,208769,"Now, a lot of noise canceling headphones"
MHhg0VCAtqk,208770,210990,don't have great audio quality.
MHhg0VCAtqk,210990,213180,"Now I'd used an older version of these headphones,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,213180,215250,"which was already excellent,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,215250,216721,but these are on a whole new level
MHhg0VCAtqk,216721,219180,and the sound is super impressive.
MHhg0VCAtqk,219180,221849,So check out the Sony XM5 at Best Buy.
MHhg0VCAtqk,221850,225060,"And again, thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this video."
MHhg0VCAtqk,225060,226709,The next piece of gear you may wanna bring
MHhg0VCAtqk,226710,228510,with you when you travel is a laptop.
MHhg0VCAtqk,228510,231000,Now everyone nowadays has their cellphone with them
MHhg0VCAtqk,231000,233940,"but if you still need to get work done when you travel,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,233940,235440,"you'll want a portable, light,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,235440,237780,and powerful laptop to take with you.
MHhg0VCAtqk,237780,241200,"One example is the MacBook air, which is extremely thin"
MHhg0VCAtqk,241200,243450,so it doesn't add a lot of bulk to your bag.
MHhg0VCAtqk,243450,245430,"It's also super light, which is important,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,245430,247650,because you'll be carrying it on your back all day.
MHhg0VCAtqk,247650,249599,And it has an extremely powerful chip
MHhg0VCAtqk,249600,252015,so you can still accomplish more demanding tasks
MHhg0VCAtqk,252015,253530,while you're on the go.
MHhg0VCAtqk,253530,255780,"And don't worry if you're not an Apple person,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,255780,258269,I'll have some Windows options in the description.
MHhg0VCAtqk,258269,260224,"Now, if you don't need to run desktop apps"
MHhg0VCAtqk,260225,263580,then you may want to consider bringing a tablet instead.
MHhg0VCAtqk,263580,266669,There are a ton of great options at different sizes.
MHhg0VCAtqk,266670,268380,And I want you to think about something
MHhg0VCAtqk,268380,270150,that gives you enough of a size advantage
MHhg0VCAtqk,270150,272850,over your cell phone to make it worth bringing with you.
MHhg0VCAtqk,272850,275280,"Now, personally, if I don't have a laptop,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,275280,277020,"I would bring a larger tablet with me,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,277020,280770,something like a Tab S8 ultra or the 12.9 inch iPad Pro.
MHhg0VCAtqk,280770,283051,And that way I have a big screen to watch movies
MHhg0VCAtqk,283051,284669,and play games on.
MHhg0VCAtqk,284670,287610,"And usually I'll also bring a keyboard case with me,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,287610,289229,which works great for emails
MHhg0VCAtqk,289230,291000,and for responding to your comments.
MHhg0VCAtqk,291000,293220,The next piece of gear that you should consider bringing
MHhg0VCAtqk,293220,295290,when you travel is a smart watch.
MHhg0VCAtqk,295290,297840,"Now, a lot of times you're gonna want to keep your phone"
MHhg0VCAtqk,297840,299648,"in your bag, especially if you're hiking or"
MHhg0VCAtqk,299648,302850,if you just wanna make sure that you don't drop it.
MHhg0VCAtqk,302850,305580,So being able to receive texts and notifications
MHhg0VCAtqk,305580,308069,on your smart watch is extremely convenient.
MHhg0VCAtqk,308070,310350,"Now, many smart watches also give you the option"
MHhg0VCAtqk,310350,312990,to respond with voice and in general being able
MHhg0VCAtqk,312990,314460,to let go of your phone
MHhg0VCAtqk,314460,316869,and know that you're still able to access important updates
MHhg0VCAtqk,316869,319169,lets you really enjoy your vacation.
MHhg0VCAtqk,319170,321810,"Now most of the time, I'm also super active when I travel."
MHhg0VCAtqk,321810,325200,So I love being able to track and monitor my fitness.
MHhg0VCAtqk,325200,327452,So it's probably no surprise that I take a lot
MHhg0VCAtqk,327452,330570,"of pictures with my phone or I also use it to shoot video,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,330570,332670,because it's really convenient.
MHhg0VCAtqk,332670,334860,But when I want a little more control
MHhg0VCAtqk,334860,337590,"or if I just want better overall quality,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,337590,339570,I still bring a small camera with me.
MHhg0VCAtqk,339570,342420,And nowadays that's the Sony ZV1.
MHhg0VCAtqk,342420,343950,It has a retractable lens
MHhg0VCAtqk,343950,346980,so it's super compact when it's in my bag or in my pocket.
MHhg0VCAtqk,346980,348210,It has a flip out screen
MHhg0VCAtqk,348210,350341,so I can see myself when I'm in front of the camera
MHhg0VCAtqk,350342,352458,and you can actually get a small handle for it
MHhg0VCAtqk,352458,354450,that doubles as a tripod.
MHhg0VCAtqk,354450,356820,"Now, regardless of which devices you bring with you,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,356820,358860,you're gonna want a portable charger.
MHhg0VCAtqk,358860,361680,Now I do my best to charge everything overnight
MHhg0VCAtqk,361680,363090,but I still don't wanna risk it.
MHhg0VCAtqk,363090,365490,So I always bring a portable charger with me.
MHhg0VCAtqk,365490,367979,I have different sizes with different capacities
MHhg0VCAtqk,367980,370230,and Anker makes some of my favorite options.
MHhg0VCAtqk,370230,372420,So I'll link to a few in the description.
MHhg0VCAtqk,372420,373620,Now when you're back in the room
MHhg0VCAtqk,373620,375180,"or at the house that you're staying in,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,375180,377400,you'll probably need to charge your devices.
MHhg0VCAtqk,377400,381419,So I highly recommend a high capacity multiport charger.
MHhg0VCAtqk,381420,383419,These let you charge up to four devices
MHhg0VCAtqk,383419,387090,at once using USBA and USBC ports.
MHhg0VCAtqk,387090,388711,And they have very high outputs
MHhg0VCAtqk,388711,391950,"so you can quickly and safely charge your laptop,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,391950,395100,"your tablet, your phone, and your smart watch all at once."
MHhg0VCAtqk,395100,397020,"Depending on how you organize your gear,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,397020,398970,you may also want a tech organizer.
MHhg0VCAtqk,398970,401220,Now there are a lot of great options out there
MHhg0VCAtqk,401220,403813,but just make sure that it fits in the bag that you use
MHhg0VCAtqk,403813,408210,and it works for all the smaller accessories that you need.
MHhg0VCAtqk,408210,409560,"Again, I'll link to a few"
MHhg0VCAtqk,409560,412050,of my favorite options in the description.
MHhg0VCAtqk,412050,413250,So I don't know about you
MHhg0VCAtqk,413250,415890,but I end up reading a ton when I travel.
MHhg0VCAtqk,415890,418140,"And while most of the time when I'm at home,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,418140,419849,I read on my phone or my tablet.
MHhg0VCAtqk,419849,422070,They aren't the best options when I'm
MHhg0VCAtqk,422070,423600,out in direct sunlight.
MHhg0VCAtqk,423600,425513,And that's where a Kindle comes in clutch.
MHhg0VCAtqk,425513,428400,There's a more affordable paper white option.
MHhg0VCAtqk,428400,430770,"And then the Oasis, which is the one that I use."
MHhg0VCAtqk,430770,432240,I always find that I'm holding it
MHhg0VCAtqk,432240,433889,with one hand when I'm laying down.
MHhg0VCAtqk,433890,436050,So it's much more comfortable to be able to
MHhg0VCAtqk,436050,438960,use these buttons to navigate from page to page.
MHhg0VCAtqk,438960,441419,"I love the safety of the IPX eight rating,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,441420,444030,which means that it's waterproof in six and a half feet
MHhg0VCAtqk,444030,445889,of water for up to 60 minutes.
MHhg0VCAtqk,445890,448145,And it's also much easier to see in bright sunlight
MHhg0VCAtqk,448145,451142,when I compare it to my phone or my tablet.
MHhg0VCAtqk,452103,452936,Now the next piece of gear
MHhg0VCAtqk,452936,454950,is one that I use at home all the time
MHhg0VCAtqk,454950,457200,but I also take it with me when I travel.
MHhg0VCAtqk,457200,460350,It's a tablet or a phone stand and it's so useful.
MHhg0VCAtqk,460350,463260,So sometimes I use it to prop a tablet to watch a movie
MHhg0VCAtqk,463260,465630,"or to game on if I'm using a controller,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,465630,468420,sometimes we have it in the kitchen so we can see a recipe.
MHhg0VCAtqk,468420,470730,"It's a small accessory, it folds down."
MHhg0VCAtqk,470730,472080,So it's really portable
MHhg0VCAtqk,472080,474210,and I highly recommend picking one up.
MHhg0VCAtqk,474210,476610,Now you should watch this tablet buying guide.
MHhg0VCAtqk,476610,478139,Hopefully this video is helpful.
MHhg0VCAtqk,478140,479670,Click on my face to subscribe.
MHhg0VCAtqk,479670,480870,Know what I always say?
MHhg0VCAtqk,480870,482790,Buy it nice or buy it twice.
MHhg0VCAtqk,482790,484293,Good luck and see you soon.

MHhg0VCAtqk,0,1860,- This could be the most important piece
MHhg0VCAtqk,1860,3780,of gear that I take with me when I travel
MHhg0VCAtqk,3780,6330,and thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this video.
MHhg0VCAtqk,6330,9510,So every device nowadays takes a different port to charge
MHhg0VCAtqk,9510,11880,"with micro USB, USBC lighting."
MHhg0VCAtqk,11880,13860,"And whenever we travel, I have to remember"

MHhg0VCAtqk,25800,28410,"Now, in addition to all the cables that I bring with me,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,28410,30008,I make sure that I have at least one
MHhg0VCAtqk,30008,34530,of these universal charging cables that has a micro USB tip
MHhg0VCAtqk,34530,38070,and then a removable tip with lightning and USBC.
MHhg0VCAtqk,38070,40200,"This cable doesn't give me the fastest charging,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,40200,41850,but it's super versatile.
MHhg0VCAtqk,41850,43890,I know that I have all my bases covered
MHhg0VCAtqk,43890,45930,and I highly recommend using it.
MHhg0VCAtqk,45930,48480,Now I'm going to show you a lot of gear in this video.
MHhg0VCAtqk,48480,51210,So another critical component is your bag
MHhg0VCAtqk,51210,54420,and I'm specifically looking at it from a tech perspective.
MHhg0VCAtqk,54420,56070,So I have three requirements.
MHhg0VCAtqk,56070,57780,The first is access.
MHhg0VCAtqk,57780,59699,I'm going to have a lot of things in this bag
MHhg0VCAtqk,59700,60990,and I don't wanna have to dig
MHhg0VCAtqk,60990,62610,through to the bottom to find something
MHhg0VCAtqk,62610,64650,or have to take everything outta the bag
MHhg0VCAtqk,64650,66660,because I can't reach something that I want.
MHhg0VCAtqk,66660,69330,So this is the peak design everyday backpack.
MHhg0VCAtqk,69330,72330,You can open it from both sides and from the top.
MHhg0VCAtqk,72330,75960,So you can always quickly and easily reach your gear.
MHhg0VCAtqk,75960,77940,"It also has a compartment at the top,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,77940,79890,which I use all the time for my phone
MHhg0VCAtqk,79890,82710,and other small things that I need quick access to.
MHhg0VCAtqk,82710,84852,And this pocket is definitely something that I miss
MHhg0VCAtqk,84852,87060,in some of my other bags.
MHhg0VCAtqk,87060,89549,And it's a feature that adds a lot of convenience.
MHhg0VCAtqk,89550,92460,The second requirement is organization and flexibility
MHhg0VCAtqk,92460,94650,and they sort of go hand in hand.
MHhg0VCAtqk,94650,96900,This bag has a ton of pockets and zippers.
MHhg0VCAtqk,96900,99390,So I can find a place for everything that I need.
MHhg0VCAtqk,99390,103380,It also has baffles that could be removed or moved around
MHhg0VCAtqk,103380,106350,so I can configure it to fit everything that I want.
MHhg0VCAtqk,106350,108720,"Now, the third requirement is protection."
MHhg0VCAtqk,108720,110850,"So this bag is really well built,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,110850,113040,the shell is super durable.
MHhg0VCAtqk,113040,114660,I've had it for over four years
MHhg0VCAtqk,114660,118110,and it pretty much looks exactly how he did when I got it.
MHhg0VCAtqk,118110,119488,There's also a good amount of padding.
MHhg0VCAtqk,119488,122580,There are dedicated laptop and tablet slots in the back
MHhg0VCAtqk,122580,124410,and you can loop the zipper pulls
MHhg0VCAtqk,124410,125610,"through the carrying loops,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,125610,128250,which prevents the zippers from being opened.
MHhg0VCAtqk,128250,130449,One thing that I always have with me is headphones
MHhg0VCAtqk,130449,133170,and they sort of fall into two categories.
MHhg0VCAtqk,133170,136230,So the first is a smaller in-ear model
MHhg0VCAtqk,136230,138209,that I can quickly pop in and out.
MHhg0VCAtqk,138210,141060,I can fit the small charging case in my pocket
MHhg0VCAtqk,141060,143010,and it lets me always have them charge
MHhg0VCAtqk,143010,144810,and they work great when I'm working out.
MHhg0VCAtqk,144810,147270,There's a lot of great options out there and I'll link
MHhg0VCAtqk,147270,149670,to a few of my favorites in the description.
MHhg0VCAtqk,149670,153090,"Now, if you want a much more immersive audio experience,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,153090,156569,then you should check out the Sony WH-1000 XM5
MHhg0VCAtqk,156570,158250,"at today's sponsor, Best Buy."
MHhg0VCAtqk,158250,160410,These are a great option for travel.
MHhg0VCAtqk,160410,163410,They have a really comfortable headband and soft ear cups
MHhg0VCAtqk,163410,165750,so you can wear them during long trips.
MHhg0VCAtqk,165750,166583,They have some of
MHhg0VCAtqk,166583,169439,the absolute best active noise cancellation.
MHhg0VCAtqk,169440,171570,"So if you're on a plane or at the airport,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,171570,172945,you can just turn on noise cancellation
MHhg0VCAtqk,172945,175950,and the outside world fades into the background.
MHhg0VCAtqk,175950,178440,And you can just listen to your music or movies.
MHhg0VCAtqk,178440,180540,"If you need to hear what's going on around you,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,180540,182579,"you can activate ambient sound mode,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,182580,185076,which will actually use the microphones to listen
MHhg0VCAtqk,185076,188070,and then send the audio into your headphones.
MHhg0VCAtqk,188070,190590,You can also cover the right ear cup with your hand
MHhg0VCAtqk,190590,192720,to temporarily let an outside noise in
MHhg0VCAtqk,192720,195690,and then lower the volume of what you're listening to.
MHhg0VCAtqk,195690,197250,"And with speak to chat,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,197250,199172,you can have the headphones actually listen
MHhg0VCAtqk,199172,202573,"and detect when you're talking, which will pause your music,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,202573,204569,"bring in the outside sound,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,204570,207150,and will allow you to have a conversation with someone.
MHhg0VCAtqk,207150,208769,"Now, a lot of noise canceling headphones"
MHhg0VCAtqk,208770,210990,don't have great audio quality.
MHhg0VCAtqk,210990,213180,"Now I'd used an older version of these headphones,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,213180,215250,"which was already excellent,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,215250,216721,but these are on a whole new level
MHhg0VCAtqk,216721,219180,and the sound is super impressive.
MHhg0VCAtqk,219180,221849,So check out the Sony XM5 at Best Buy.
MHhg0VCAtqk,221850,225060,"And again, thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this video."
MHhg0VCAtqk,225060,226709,The next piece of gear you may wanna bring
MHhg0VCAtqk,226710,228510,with you when you travel is a laptop.
MHhg0VCAtqk,228510,231000,Now everyone nowadays has their cellphone with them
MHhg0VCAtqk,231000,233940,"but if you still need to get work done when you travel,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,233940,235440,"you'll want a portable, light,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,235440,237780,and powerful laptop to take with you.
MHhg0VCAtqk,237780,241200,"One example is the MacBook air, which is extremely thin"
MHhg0VCAtqk,241200,243450,so it doesn't add a lot of bulk to your bag.
MHhg0VCAtqk,243450,245430,"It's also super light, which is important,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,245430,247650,because you'll be carrying it on your back all day.
MHhg0VCAtqk,247650,249599,And it has an extremely powerful chip
MHhg0VCAtqk,249600,252015,so you can still accomplish more demanding tasks
MHhg0VCAtqk,252015,253530,while you're on the go.
MHhg0VCAtqk,253530,255780,"And don't worry if you're not an Apple person,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,255780,258269,I'll have some Windows options in the description.
MHhg0VCAtqk,258269,260224,"Now, if you don't need to run desktop apps"
MHhg0VCAtqk,260225,263580,then you may want to consider bringing a tablet instead.
MHhg0VCAtqk,263580,266669,There are a ton of great options at different sizes.
MHhg0VCAtqk,266670,268380,And I want you to think about something
MHhg0VCAtqk,268380,270150,that gives you enough of a size advantage
MHhg0VCAtqk,270150,272850,over your cell phone to make it worth bringing with you.
MHhg0VCAtqk,272850,275280,"Now, personally, if I don't have a laptop,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,275280,277020,"I would bring a larger tablet with me,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,277020,280770,something like a Tab S8 ultra or the 12.9 inch iPad Pro.
MHhg0VCAtqk,280770,283051,And that way I have a big screen to watch movies
MHhg0VCAtqk,283051,284669,and play games on.
MHhg0VCAtqk,284670,287610,"And usually I'll also bring a keyboard case with me,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,287610,289229,which works great for emails
MHhg0VCAtqk,289230,291000,and for responding to your comments.
MHhg0VCAtqk,291000,293220,The next piece of gear that you should consider bringing
MHhg0VCAtqk,293220,295290,when you travel is a smart watch.
MHhg0VCAtqk,295290,297840,"Now, a lot of times you're gonna want to keep your phone"
MHhg0VCAtqk,297840,299648,"in your bag, especially if you're hiking or"
MHhg0VCAtqk,299648,302850,if you just wanna make sure that you don't drop it.
MHhg0VCAtqk,302850,305580,So being able to receive texts and notifications
MHhg0VCAtqk,305580,308069,on your smart watch is extremely convenient.
MHhg0VCAtqk,308070,310350,"Now, many smart watches also give you the option"
MHhg0VCAtqk,310350,312990,to respond with voice and in general being able
MHhg0VCAtqk,312990,314460,to let go of your phone
MHhg0VCAtqk,314460,316869,and know that you're still able to access important updates
MHhg0VCAtqk,316869,319169,lets you really enjoy your vacation.
MHhg0VCAtqk,319170,321810,"Now most of the time, I'm also super active when I travel."
MHhg0VCAtqk,321810,325200,So I love being able to track and monitor my fitness.
MHhg0VCAtqk,325200,327452,So it's probably no surprise that I take a lot
MHhg0VCAtqk,327452,330570,"of pictures with my phone or I also use it to shoot video,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,330570,332670,because it's really convenient.
MHhg0VCAtqk,332670,334860,But when I want a little more control
MHhg0VCAtqk,334860,337590,"or if I just want better overall quality,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,337590,339570,I still bring a small camera with me.
MHhg0VCAtqk,339570,342420,And nowadays that's the Sony ZV1.
MHhg0VCAtqk,342420,343950,It has a retractable lens
MHhg0VCAtqk,343950,346980,so it's super compact when it's in my bag or in my pocket.
MHhg0VCAtqk,346980,348210,It has a flip out screen
MHhg0VCAtqk,348210,350341,so I can see myself when I'm in front of the camera
MHhg0VCAtqk,350342,352458,and you can actually get a small handle for it
MHhg0VCAtqk,352458,354450,that doubles as a tripod.
MHhg0VCAtqk,354450,356820,"Now, regardless of which devices you bring with you,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,356820,358860,you're gonna want a portable charger.
MHhg0VCAtqk,358860,361680,Now I do my best to charge everything overnight
MHhg0VCAtqk,361680,363090,but I still don't wanna risk it.
MHhg0VCAtqk,363090,365490,So I always bring a portable charger with me.
MHhg0VCAtqk,365490,367979,I have different sizes with different capacities
MHhg0VCAtqk,367980,370230,and Anker makes some of my favorite options.
MHhg0VCAtqk,370230,372420,So I'll link to a few in the description.
MHhg0VCAtqk,372420,373620,Now when you're back in the room
MHhg0VCAtqk,373620,375180,"or at the house that you're staying in,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,375180,377400,you'll probably need to charge your devices.
MHhg0VCAtqk,377400,381419,So I highly recommend a high capacity multiport charger.
MHhg0VCAtqk,381420,383419,These let you charge up to four devices
MHhg0VCAtqk,383419,387090,at once using USBA and USBC ports.
MHhg0VCAtqk,387090,388711,And they have very high outputs
MHhg0VCAtqk,388711,391950,"so you can quickly and safely charge your laptop,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,391950,395100,"your tablet, your phone, and your smart watch all at once."
MHhg0VCAtqk,395100,397020,"Depending on how you organize your gear,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,397020,398970,you may also want a tech organizer.
MHhg0VCAtqk,398970,401220,Now there are a lot of great options out there
MHhg0VCAtqk,401220,403813,but just make sure that it fits in the bag that you use
MHhg0VCAtqk,403813,408210,and it works for all the smaller accessories that you need.
MHhg0VCAtqk,408210,409560,"Again, I'll link to a few"
MHhg0VCAtqk,409560,412050,of my favorite options in the description.
MHhg0VCAtqk,412050,413250,So I don't know about you
MHhg0VCAtqk,413250,415890,but I end up reading a ton when I travel.
MHhg0VCAtqk,415890,418140,"And while most of the time when I'm at home,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,418140,419849,I read on my phone or my tablet.
MHhg0VCAtqk,419849,422070,They aren't the best options when I'm
MHhg0VCAtqk,422070,423600,out in direct sunlight.
MHhg0VCAtqk,423600,425513,And that's where a Kindle comes in clutch.
MHhg0VCAtqk,425513,428400,There's a more affordable paper white option.
MHhg0VCAtqk,428400,430770,"And then the Oasis, which is the one that I use."
MHhg0VCAtqk,430770,432240,I always find that I'm holding it
MHhg0VCAtqk,432240,433889,with one hand when I'm laying down.
MHhg0VCAtqk,433890,436050,So it's much more comfortable to be able to
MHhg0VCAtqk,436050,438960,use these buttons to navigate from page to page.
MHhg0VCAtqk,438960,441419,"I love the safety of the IPX eight rating,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,441420,444030,which means that it's waterproof in six and a half feet
MHhg0VCAtqk,444030,445889,of water for up to 60 minutes.
MHhg0VCAtqk,445890,448145,And it's also much easier to see in bright sunlight
MHhg0VCAtqk,448145,451142,when I compare it to my phone or my tablet.
MHhg0VCAtqk,452103,452936,Now the next piece of gear
MHhg0VCAtqk,452936,454950,is one that I use at home all the time
MHhg0VCAtqk,454950,457200,but I also take it with me when I travel.
MHhg0VCAtqk,457200,460350,It's a tablet or a phone stand and it's so useful.
MHhg0VCAtqk,460350,463260,So sometimes I use it to prop a tablet to watch a movie
MHhg0VCAtqk,463260,465630,"or to game on if I'm using a controller,"
MHhg0VCAtqk,465630,468420,sometimes we have it in the kitchen so we can see a recipe.
MHhg0VCAtqk,468420,470730,"It's a small accessory, it folds down."
MHhg0VCAtqk,470730,472080,So it's really portable
MHhg0VCAtqk,472080,474210,and I highly recommend picking one up.
MHhg0VCAtqk,474210,476610,Now you should watch this tablet buying guide.
MHhg0VCAtqk,476610,478139,Hopefully this video is helpful.
MHhg0VCAtqk,478140,479670,Click on my face to subscribe.
MHhg0VCAtqk,479670,480870,Know what I always say?
MHhg0VCAtqk,480870,482790,Buy it nice or buy it twice.
MHhg0VCAtqk,482790,484293,Good luck and see you soon.
