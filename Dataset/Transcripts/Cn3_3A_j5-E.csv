Cn3_3A_j5-E,130479,133920,two-tone finish i would say and based on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,133920,136239,how the light kind of reflects it does
Cn3_3A_j5-E,136239,138640,give you this uh it's like a mattified
Cn3_3A_j5-E,138640,140480,yeah it softens the light that's kind of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,140480,142160,nice i mean i definitely prefer matte
Cn3_3A_j5-E,142160,143599,finishes on the back and it's actually

Cn3_3A_j5-E,213440,214879,different all right back to me more
Cn3_3A_j5-E,214879,216720,importantly similar setup actually and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,216720,219360,actually we have the same 67 watt turbo
Cn3_3A_j5-E,219360,222319,charger and also the usb cable as well
Cn3_3A_j5-E,222319,225840,this has the snapdragon 870 we've also
Cn3_3A_j5-E,225840,226799,got a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,226799,230000,120 hertz amoled screen with this
Cn3_3A_j5-E,230000,231040,and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,231040,232400,while we don't have a headphone jack we
Cn3_3A_j5-E,232400,234400,do get stereo speakers i think they both
Cn3_3A_j5-E,234400,237120,do and they're also very thin both
Cn3_3A_j5-E,237120,239120,devices they are quite thin so even
Cn3_3A_j5-E,239120,241360,though we've got very large displays
Cn3_3A_j5-E,241360,242640,they do
Cn3_3A_j5-E,242640,244720,feel pretty comfortable i'd say also a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,244720,246239,nice little protective case as well so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,246239,248319,that can slip right on there slap that
Cn3_3A_j5-E,248319,250879,right on there you go

Cn3_3A_j5-E,257040,258720,the unboxing he missed out this key
Cn3_3A_j5-E,258720,261040,element here oh i did you do have an
Cn3_3A_j5-E,261040,263840,adapter included as well so this is a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,263840,268160,usb type-c to 3.5 millimeter converter
Cn3_3A_j5-E,268160,270080,you're not getting okay i will just plug

Cn3_3A_j5-E,276160,278240,maybe like four and a half five out of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,278240,281280,ten yeah that wasn't fantastic yeah he
Cn3_3A_j5-E,281280,283759,needs many more takes you know he's not
Cn3_3A_j5-E,283759,287280,been doing this very long so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,287919,289919,so i'll be showing tom how to actually
Cn3_3A_j5-E,289919,292080,take some photos here on the f4 the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,292080,293280,first thing we need to do is let's just
Cn3_3A_j5-E,293280,294800,go for drips right you need to wardrobe
Cn3_3A_j5-E,294800,296160,we'll just change the whole thing
Cn3_3A_j5-E,296160,298160,including yourself so we want tilting
Cn3_3A_j5-E,298160,300320,which is your good side uh this like
Cn3_3A_j5-E,300320,301199,this
Cn3_3A_j5-E,301199,303280,yes brilliant go on give me a few
Cn3_3A_j5-E,303280,305600,different poses yeah god god love it
Cn3_3A_j5-E,305600,307680,gorgeous okay so this is the portrait
Cn3_3A_j5-E,307680,309759,mode yeah that's some that's some that's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,309759,311440,some really good edge detection we've
Cn3_3A_j5-E,311440,313039,got the sign here in the background as
Cn3_3A_j5-E,313039,314720,well that's blurred out a little bit
Cn3_3A_j5-E,314720,316400,just to give it a nice little bokeh
Cn3_3A_j5-E,316400,319120,effect so this is a 64 megapixel setup
Cn3_3A_j5-E,319120,321440,we've got this main lens four in one
Cn3_3A_j5-E,321440,322639,pixel binning then we have an eight
Cn3_3A_j5-E,322639,324080,megapixel ultra wide and if you want to
Cn3_3A_j5-E,324080,325919,see more of my behind the scenes of the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,325919,326800,studio
Cn3_3A_j5-E,326800,328400,which i've not tidied up don't don't
Cn3_3A_j5-E,328400,331280,look around and the 2 megapixel macro i
Cn3_3A_j5-E,331280,332400,think we all know how we feel about
Cn3_3A_j5-E,332400,334560,macro lenses but it's there if you want
Cn3_3A_j5-E,334560,337039,it there's no dedicated uh telephoto
Cn3_3A_j5-E,337039,339360,lens but you can of course zoom in and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,339360,340800,use some a bit of the ai to sort of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,340800,342560,improve that as well and you can shoot
Cn3_3A_j5-E,342560,344639,4k video so as i say this is the first
Cn3_3A_j5-E,344639,347680,pocophone with ois so if we sort of just
Cn3_3A_j5-E,347680,349199,move around a little bit
Cn3_3A_j5-E,349199,351759,and look at that bit of shade going on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,351759,353440,this should be the smoothest video you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,353440,354960,can get on a poker phone it does make a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,354960,356160,big difference that optical image
Cn3_3A_j5-E,356160,358000,stabilization i'm keen to see this uh
Cn3_3A_j5-E,358000,359440,this this profile photo as well do you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,359440,360560,want to take another one
Cn3_3A_j5-E,360560,362800,do you want more i can't i can do i mean
Cn3_3A_j5-E,362800,365280,they're going to cost you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,365280,366960,look at that do you want to show us a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,366960,368479,thing or two about gaming all right so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,368479,370000,we've got a bunch of games downloaded
Cn3_3A_j5-E,370000,371840,here let's jump into a bit of mobile
Cn3_3A_j5-E,371840,372800,engines
Cn3_3A_j5-E,372800,375280,bang bang but what you can do is swipe
Cn3_3A_j5-E,375280,376560,in from either side to bring up this
Cn3_3A_j5-E,376560,379199,game turbo menu so like any good gaming
Cn3_3A_j5-E,379199,380479,phone you've got a bunch of options here
Cn3_3A_j5-E,380479,382639,you can record the screen don't disturb
Cn3_3A_j5-E,382639,384160,change the settings change the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,384160,385520,performance you can boost it for a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,385520,387360,little bit you can see that look at that
Cn3_3A_j5-E,387360,389280,the fps jumping right up there so you're
Cn3_3A_j5-E,389280,391039,really taking advantage of that 144
Cn3_3A_j5-E,391039,392639,hertz screen so you can see here how it
Cn3_3A_j5-E,392639,395600,actually changes the sort of speed of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,395600,396960,your movements
Cn3_3A_j5-E,396960,398400,and the responsiveness of the phone you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,398400,399840,can change it to how you want but let's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,399840,402080,keep it in pro mode i like the visual
Cn3_3A_j5-E,402080,404319,representation it's so it's very it's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,404319,405600,very intuitive isn't it do we get some
Cn3_3A_j5-E,405600,407039,volume as well because we've got dual
Cn3_3A_j5-E,407039,409919,speakers it's time we learn a new skill
Cn3_3A_j5-E,409919,411759,that's very loud
Cn3_3A_j5-E,411759,413440,that was very loud all right here we go
Cn3_3A_j5-E,413440,416800,tech chat versus belmont
Cn3_3A_j5-E,416800,418639,okay running away too far you can see
Cn3_3A_j5-E,418639,420400,there's not a drop in
Cn3_3A_j5-E,420400,422960,frames here it's smooth as butter and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,422960,425039,actually i'm enjoying the vibration the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,425039,427599,feedback it's got a x linear haptic
Cn3_3A_j5-E,427599,429520,motor in here so that the force feedback
Cn3_3A_j5-E,429520,433120,the haptics actually feel quite nice
Cn3_3A_j5-E,434240,435680,victory
Cn3_3A_j5-E,435680,438000,he said i couldn't do it
Cn3_3A_j5-E,438000,439520,that was the demo now let's play the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,439520,441440,real game
Cn3_3A_j5-E,441440,442880,we don't know the price of these i
Cn3_3A_j5-E,442880,444479,should say that's a mystery right now
Cn3_3A_j5-E,444479,445759,it'll be down in the description when
Cn3_3A_j5-E,445759,447680,you've got it yes we'll
Cn3_3A_j5-E,447680,449280,put it put a comment below and also put
Cn3_3A_j5-E,449280,451039,in the description uh the pricing and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,451039,452560,also where you can buy it if you fancy
Cn3_3A_j5-E,452560,454880,generally this is more of an all-rounder
Cn3_3A_j5-E,454880,456880,phone um and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,456880,458000,the first thing i noticed really was
Cn3_3A_j5-E,458000,460080,just how fast it is with that 120 hours
Cn3_3A_j5-E,460080,462160,refresh the 120 has really does make a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,462160,464720,difference and amol as well so 120 hertz
Cn3_3A_j5-E,464720,466479,amoled one of the first things i noticed
Cn3_3A_j5-E,466479,468080,is how small that little hole punch
Cn3_3A_j5-E,468080,470879,cutout is it is one of the smallest
Cn3_3A_j5-E,470879,473039,which you're gonna learn to ignore
Cn3_3A_j5-E,473039,474800,shortly after using it yeah just like
Cn3_3A_j5-E,474800,478599,when you subscribe to supersaf
Cn3_3A_j5-E,478960,480400,and actually you'll see if we jump into
Cn3_3A_j5-E,480400,482879,the refresh rate settings on each it is
Cn3_3A_j5-E,482879,485120,set to the default recommended mode yeah
Cn3_3A_j5-E,485120,487199,so that will switch based on what you're
Cn3_3A_j5-E,487199,489280,using so it might be down to 60 if
Cn3_3A_j5-E,489280,491120,you're just on something standard but
Cn3_3A_j5-E,491120,493280,then if you are gaming or using
Cn3_3A_j5-E,493280,495199,something that can take advantage of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,495199,496400,that high refresh rate when you're
Cn3_3A_j5-E,496400,499039,scrolling then it's going to go up to
Cn3_3A_j5-E,499039,501039,120 it'll switch to 800 or you can get a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,501039,503199,custom and specify one or the other so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,503199,505680,if you want you can keep it at 120 all
Cn3_3A_j5-E,505680,506800,the time if you want but i'll use a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,506800,508639,little bit more battery yes we've got
Cn3_3A_j5-E,508639,513919,the lcd here on the x4 gt and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,513919,517039,we do also have 144 hertz which just
Cn3_3A_j5-E,517039,519200,makes things that much smoother and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,519200,522320,along with the demensity 8 100. that's a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,522320,525440,five nanometer chipset we've got lpddr5
Cn3_3A_j5-E,525440,527839,ram on both devices as well as ufs three
Cn3_3A_j5-E,527839,529920,point ones both have that personally
Cn3_3A_j5-E,529920,530880,speaking
Cn3_3A_j5-E,530880,532800,i like to game my smartphone
Cn3_3A_j5-E,532800,534880,occasionally but i don't want something
Cn3_3A_j5-E,534880,536880,that looks like a gaming phone that's a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,536880,538320,very good point you want the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,538320,540480,capabilities of gaming phone with yes
Cn3_3A_j5-E,540480,541760,well i know we've got vapor chamber
Cn3_3A_j5-E,541760,544399,coolers in both and also some new ice
Cn3_3A_j5-E,544399,546320,cool technology sustained performance is
Cn3_3A_j5-E,546320,548640,important and with the liquid cool
Cn3_3A_j5-E,548640,550720,technology that we've got 2.0 on here
Cn3_3A_j5-E,550720,553440,we've also got a 32 large vapor chamber
Cn3_3A_j5-E,553440,555519,so that just makes things
Cn3_3A_j5-E,555519,557680,much more sustained over a longer period
Cn3_3A_j5-E,557680,559440,of time when you are gaming and keeping
Cn3_3A_j5-E,559440,560640,that heat down
Cn3_3A_j5-E,560640,563120,so the x4 gt is powered by that mediatek
Cn3_3A_j5-E,563120,566160,demensity 8100 and like the f4 we're
Cn3_3A_j5-E,566160,567519,also getting that liquid cool 2
Cn3_3A_j5-E,567519,571040,technology and ufs 3.1 lp tdr5 all the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,571040,572640,good stuff and also one of the most
Cn3_3A_j5-E,572640,574560,powerful and efficient processors you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,574560,576320,can get in a phone they're both
Cn3_3A_j5-E,576320,579279,incredibly capable chips as you say uh
Cn3_3A_j5-E,579279,580800,five nanometers on that one seven on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,580800,582800,this one so the dimensions a little bit
Cn3_3A_j5-E,582800,585360,newer but they're both well they'll run
Cn3_3A_j5-E,585360,586880,everything you throw at it when you've
Cn3_3A_j5-E,586880,589800,got 270 hertz touch sampling as well as
Cn3_3A_j5-E,589800,593120,144 hertz lcd display it's just going to
Cn3_3A_j5-E,593120,594880,make things very responsive so as soon
Cn3_3A_j5-E,594880,596800,as you touch a trigger you'll be seeing
Cn3_3A_j5-E,596800,599120,that response uh without any delay so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,599120,600720,that's something that's really good i
Cn3_3A_j5-E,600720,602880,know both phones do get a glass five on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,602880,604800,the front keep them protected uh and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,604800,606800,actually the f4 we have 900 nips of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,606800,608399,brightness uh in high brightness mode
Cn3_3A_j5-E,608399,610560,and also we can peak at 1300 nits with
Cn3_3A_j5-E,610560,612240,hdr so if you're watching you know
Cn3_3A_j5-E,612240,614079,videos and movies and if you're like me
Cn3_3A_j5-E,614079,615920,with these on all the time you're gonna
Cn3_3A_j5-E,615920,617760,need a great phone and you you can see
Cn3_3A_j5-E,617760,619360,that very clearly which is i mean
Cn3_3A_j5-E,619360,620880,they're both great for entertainment and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,620880,621920,gaming but they've got slightly
Cn3_3A_j5-E,621920,623200,different
Cn3_3A_j5-E,623200,625040,slight different directions there so the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,625040,627519,f4 is powered by the snapdragon 870
Cn3_3A_j5-E,627519,628880,which is still one of the best chips on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,628880,631040,the market for performance both in terms
Cn3_3A_j5-E,631040,633040,of high clock speeds and also the isp
Cn3_3A_j5-E,633040,635279,for the camera and together with poco's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,635279,638000,liquid cool technology 2.0 and also the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,638000,640079,bigger vapor chamber cooler inside for
Cn3_3A_j5-E,640079,642800,the money this is a pretty solid setup
Cn3_3A_j5-E,642800,644800,battery life it's important it's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,644800,646320,important we want something that can
Cn3_3A_j5-E,646320,648240,last a long time unlike
Cn3_3A_j5-E,648240,649200,tom detective
Cn3_3A_j5-E,649200,652560,[Laughter]
Cn3_3A_j5-E,652560,653680,wow
Cn3_3A_j5-E,653680,655519,wow 5 000
Cn3_3A_j5-E,655519,658560,okay 5 080 million power battery that's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,658560,660320,a that's a pretty sizable battery yeah
Cn3_3A_j5-E,660320,662160,yours is bigger than mine as they say uh
Cn3_3A_j5-E,662160,663680,no this is actually got the free 500
Cn3_3A_j5-E,663680,665600,million power battery um but i guess
Cn3_3A_j5-E,665600,666720,obviously that being more gaming
Cn3_3A_j5-E,666720,668640,oriented that yeah you are gonna that
Cn3_3A_j5-E,668640,669920,will drain the battery quicker so you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,669920,671519,want a bit of edge it will do and they
Cn3_3A_j5-E,671519,675120,both have that 67 watt turbo charging
Cn3_3A_j5-E,675120,676480,yeah and that just means you're gonna be
Cn3_3A_j5-E,676480,680079,able to go from zero to 100 in around 46
Cn3_3A_j5-E,680079,682160,minutes which is really good so as you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,682160,684560,can see we have miui 13 running here
Cn3_3A_j5-E,684560,686320,this is on top of android 12 so it's the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,686320,688560,same software on both we've got lpddr5
Cn3_3A_j5-E,688560,691200,on both and you've also got ufs 3.1
Cn3_3A_j5-E,691200,693760,storage so everything is super smooth
Cn3_3A_j5-E,693760,696160,alongside the high refresh rates um and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,696160,698079,also on the side we have a little
Cn3_3A_j5-E,698079,699600,fingerprint reader yeah did you notice
Cn3_3A_j5-E,699600,701600,that yes convenient my power button
Cn3_3A_j5-E,701600,702800,doubles as a fingerprint although we do
Cn3_3A_j5-E,702800,704800,also get face unlocking if you prefer so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,704800,706079,you've got the fingerprint reader and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,706079,707839,the face unlock which is nice on both we
Cn3_3A_j5-E,707839,709680,have an ir blaster they both are buyer

Cn3_3A_j5-E,721200,723519,to have that here now i'm guessing this

Cn3_3A_j5-E,84240,85920,which i generally don't really take a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,85920,89360,look at and then we also have a clear
Cn3_3A_j5-E,89360,90400,case
Cn3_3A_j5-E,90400,93119,got some of the key highlights here
Cn3_3A_j5-E,93119,95040,which you can see at the front so we do
Cn3_3A_j5-E,95040,99040,have the demensity 8100 which is five
Cn3_3A_j5-E,99040,100880,nanometers chipset
Cn3_3A_j5-E,100880,103840,very capable we've got a 144 hertz
Cn3_3A_j5-E,103840,105759,display that's another key highlight
Cn3_3A_j5-E,105759,107840,which we'll take a look at the 67 watt
Cn3_3A_j5-E,107840,110799,charging uh as well as a high resolution
Cn3_3A_j5-E,110799,114720,64 megapixel triple camera system right

Cn3_3A_j5-E,118320,121960,[Applause]
Cn3_3A_j5-E,125600,126880,there we go
Cn3_3A_j5-E,126880,128959,here it is we've got some flat edges
Cn3_3A_j5-E,128959,130479,we've got this uh
Cn3_3A_j5-E,130479,133920,two-tone finish i would say and based on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,133920,136239,how the light kind of reflects it does
Cn3_3A_j5-E,136239,138640,give you this uh it's like a mattified
Cn3_3A_j5-E,138640,140480,yeah it softens the light that's kind of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,140480,142160,nice i mean i definitely prefer matte
Cn3_3A_j5-E,142160,143599,finishes on the back and it's actually
Cn3_3A_j5-E,143599,144879,got to be a grip as well would you like

Cn3_3A_j5-E,209120,210720,camera layout yeah i'm definitely more
Cn3_3A_j5-E,210720,212080,for the matte finish myself how about
Cn3_3A_j5-E,212080,213440,you so i like both yeah a little
Cn3_3A_j5-E,213440,214879,different all right back to me more
Cn3_3A_j5-E,214879,216720,importantly similar setup actually and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,216720,219360,actually we have the same 67 watt turbo
Cn3_3A_j5-E,219360,222319,charger and also the usb cable as well
Cn3_3A_j5-E,222319,225840,this has the snapdragon 870 we've also
Cn3_3A_j5-E,225840,226799,got a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,226799,230000,120 hertz amoled screen with this
Cn3_3A_j5-E,230000,231040,and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,231040,232400,while we don't have a headphone jack we
Cn3_3A_j5-E,232400,234400,do get stereo speakers i think they both
Cn3_3A_j5-E,234400,237120,do and they're also very thin both
Cn3_3A_j5-E,237120,239120,devices they are quite thin so even
Cn3_3A_j5-E,239120,241360,though we've got very large displays
Cn3_3A_j5-E,241360,242640,they do
Cn3_3A_j5-E,242640,244720,feel pretty comfortable i'd say also a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,244720,246239,nice little protective case as well so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,246239,248319,that can slip right on there slap that
Cn3_3A_j5-E,248319,250879,right on there you go
Cn3_3A_j5-E,250879,253200,beautiful you missed out something as
Cn3_3A_j5-E,253200,255200,well i mean this is this is you know
Cn3_3A_j5-E,255200,257040,you've got an amateur just trying to do
Cn3_3A_j5-E,257040,258720,the unboxing he missed out this key
Cn3_3A_j5-E,258720,261040,element here oh i did you do have an
Cn3_3A_j5-E,261040,263840,adapter included as well so this is a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,263840,268160,usb type-c to 3.5 millimeter converter
Cn3_3A_j5-E,268160,270080,you're not getting okay i will just plug
Cn3_3A_j5-E,270080,271199,that in for you here i'll show you how
Cn3_3A_j5-E,271199,272400,it's done thank you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,272400,275600,dangling your dongle
Cn3_3A_j5-E,276160,278240,maybe like four and a half five out of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,278240,281280,ten yeah that wasn't fantastic yeah he
Cn3_3A_j5-E,281280,283759,needs many more takes you know he's not
Cn3_3A_j5-E,283759,287280,been doing this very long so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,287919,289919,so i'll be showing tom how to actually
Cn3_3A_j5-E,289919,292080,take some photos here on the f4 the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,292080,293280,first thing we need to do is let's just
Cn3_3A_j5-E,293280,294800,go for drips right you need to wardrobe
Cn3_3A_j5-E,294800,296160,we'll just change the whole thing
Cn3_3A_j5-E,296160,298160,including yourself so we want tilting
Cn3_3A_j5-E,298160,300320,which is your good side uh this like
Cn3_3A_j5-E,300320,301199,this
Cn3_3A_j5-E,301199,303280,yes brilliant go on give me a few
Cn3_3A_j5-E,303280,305600,different poses yeah god god love it
Cn3_3A_j5-E,305600,307680,gorgeous okay so this is the portrait
Cn3_3A_j5-E,307680,309759,mode yeah that's some that's some that's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,309759,311440,some really good edge detection we've
Cn3_3A_j5-E,311440,313039,got the sign here in the background as
Cn3_3A_j5-E,313039,314720,well that's blurred out a little bit
Cn3_3A_j5-E,314720,316400,just to give it a nice little bokeh
Cn3_3A_j5-E,316400,319120,effect so this is a 64 megapixel setup
Cn3_3A_j5-E,319120,321440,we've got this main lens four in one
Cn3_3A_j5-E,321440,322639,pixel binning then we have an eight
Cn3_3A_j5-E,322639,324080,megapixel ultra wide and if you want to
Cn3_3A_j5-E,324080,325919,see more of my behind the scenes of the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,325919,326800,studio
Cn3_3A_j5-E,326800,328400,which i've not tidied up don't don't
Cn3_3A_j5-E,328400,331280,look around and the 2 megapixel macro i
Cn3_3A_j5-E,331280,332400,think we all know how we feel about
Cn3_3A_j5-E,332400,334560,macro lenses but it's there if you want
Cn3_3A_j5-E,334560,337039,it there's no dedicated uh telephoto
Cn3_3A_j5-E,337039,339360,lens but you can of course zoom in and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,339360,340800,use some a bit of the ai to sort of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,340800,342560,improve that as well and you can shoot
Cn3_3A_j5-E,342560,344639,4k video so as i say this is the first
Cn3_3A_j5-E,344639,347680,pocophone with ois so if we sort of just
Cn3_3A_j5-E,347680,349199,move around a little bit
Cn3_3A_j5-E,349199,351759,and look at that bit of shade going on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,351759,353440,this should be the smoothest video you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,353440,354960,can get on a poker phone it does make a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,354960,356160,big difference that optical image
Cn3_3A_j5-E,356160,358000,stabilization i'm keen to see this uh
Cn3_3A_j5-E,358000,359440,this this profile photo as well do you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,359440,360560,want to take another one
Cn3_3A_j5-E,360560,362800,do you want more i can't i can do i mean
Cn3_3A_j5-E,362800,365280,they're going to cost you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,365280,366960,look at that do you want to show us a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,366960,368479,thing or two about gaming all right so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,368479,370000,we've got a bunch of games downloaded
Cn3_3A_j5-E,370000,371840,here let's jump into a bit of mobile
Cn3_3A_j5-E,371840,372800,engines
Cn3_3A_j5-E,372800,375280,bang bang but what you can do is swipe
Cn3_3A_j5-E,375280,376560,in from either side to bring up this
Cn3_3A_j5-E,376560,379199,game turbo menu so like any good gaming
Cn3_3A_j5-E,379199,380479,phone you've got a bunch of options here
Cn3_3A_j5-E,380479,382639,you can record the screen don't disturb
Cn3_3A_j5-E,382639,384160,change the settings change the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,384160,385520,performance you can boost it for a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,385520,387360,little bit you can see that look at that
Cn3_3A_j5-E,387360,389280,the fps jumping right up there so you're
Cn3_3A_j5-E,389280,391039,really taking advantage of that 144
Cn3_3A_j5-E,391039,392639,hertz screen so you can see here how it
Cn3_3A_j5-E,392639,395600,actually changes the sort of speed of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,395600,396960,your movements
Cn3_3A_j5-E,396960,398400,and the responsiveness of the phone you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,398400,399840,can change it to how you want but let's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,399840,402080,keep it in pro mode i like the visual
Cn3_3A_j5-E,402080,404319,representation it's so it's very it's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,404319,405600,very intuitive isn't it do we get some
Cn3_3A_j5-E,405600,407039,volume as well because we've got dual
Cn3_3A_j5-E,407039,409919,speakers it's time we learn a new skill
Cn3_3A_j5-E,409919,411759,that's very loud
Cn3_3A_j5-E,411759,413440,that was very loud all right here we go
Cn3_3A_j5-E,413440,416800,tech chat versus belmont
Cn3_3A_j5-E,416800,418639,okay running away too far you can see
Cn3_3A_j5-E,418639,420400,there's not a drop in
Cn3_3A_j5-E,420400,422960,frames here it's smooth as butter and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,422960,425039,actually i'm enjoying the vibration the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,425039,427599,feedback it's got a x linear haptic
Cn3_3A_j5-E,427599,429520,motor in here so that the force feedback
Cn3_3A_j5-E,429520,433120,the haptics actually feel quite nice
Cn3_3A_j5-E,434240,435680,victory
Cn3_3A_j5-E,435680,438000,he said i couldn't do it
Cn3_3A_j5-E,438000,439520,that was the demo now let's play the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,439520,441440,real game
Cn3_3A_j5-E,441440,442880,we don't know the price of these i
Cn3_3A_j5-E,442880,444479,should say that's a mystery right now
Cn3_3A_j5-E,444479,445759,it'll be down in the description when
Cn3_3A_j5-E,445759,447680,you've got it yes we'll
Cn3_3A_j5-E,447680,449280,put it put a comment below and also put
Cn3_3A_j5-E,449280,451039,in the description uh the pricing and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,451039,452560,also where you can buy it if you fancy
Cn3_3A_j5-E,452560,454880,generally this is more of an all-rounder
Cn3_3A_j5-E,454880,456880,phone um and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,456880,458000,the first thing i noticed really was
Cn3_3A_j5-E,458000,460080,just how fast it is with that 120 hours
Cn3_3A_j5-E,460080,462160,refresh the 120 has really does make a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,462160,464720,difference and amol as well so 120 hertz
Cn3_3A_j5-E,464720,466479,amoled one of the first things i noticed
Cn3_3A_j5-E,466479,468080,is how small that little hole punch
Cn3_3A_j5-E,468080,470879,cutout is it is one of the smallest
Cn3_3A_j5-E,470879,473039,which you're gonna learn to ignore
Cn3_3A_j5-E,473039,474800,shortly after using it yeah just like
Cn3_3A_j5-E,474800,478599,when you subscribe to supersaf
Cn3_3A_j5-E,478960,480400,and actually you'll see if we jump into
Cn3_3A_j5-E,480400,482879,the refresh rate settings on each it is
Cn3_3A_j5-E,482879,485120,set to the default recommended mode yeah
Cn3_3A_j5-E,485120,487199,so that will switch based on what you're
Cn3_3A_j5-E,487199,489280,using so it might be down to 60 if
Cn3_3A_j5-E,489280,491120,you're just on something standard but
Cn3_3A_j5-E,491120,493280,then if you are gaming or using
Cn3_3A_j5-E,493280,495199,something that can take advantage of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,495199,496400,that high refresh rate when you're
Cn3_3A_j5-E,496400,499039,scrolling then it's going to go up to
Cn3_3A_j5-E,499039,501039,120 it'll switch to 800 or you can get a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,501039,503199,custom and specify one or the other so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,503199,505680,if you want you can keep it at 120 all
Cn3_3A_j5-E,505680,506800,the time if you want but i'll use a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,506800,508639,little bit more battery yes we've got
Cn3_3A_j5-E,508639,513919,the lcd here on the x4 gt and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,513919,517039,we do also have 144 hertz which just
Cn3_3A_j5-E,517039,519200,makes things that much smoother and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,519200,522320,along with the demensity 8 100. that's a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,522320,525440,five nanometer chipset we've got lpddr5
Cn3_3A_j5-E,525440,527839,ram on both devices as well as ufs three
Cn3_3A_j5-E,527839,529920,point ones both have that personally
Cn3_3A_j5-E,529920,530880,speaking
Cn3_3A_j5-E,530880,532800,i like to game my smartphone
Cn3_3A_j5-E,532800,534880,occasionally but i don't want something
Cn3_3A_j5-E,534880,536880,that looks like a gaming phone that's a
Cn3_3A_j5-E,536880,538320,very good point you want the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,538320,540480,capabilities of gaming phone with yes
Cn3_3A_j5-E,540480,541760,well i know we've got vapor chamber
Cn3_3A_j5-E,541760,544399,coolers in both and also some new ice
Cn3_3A_j5-E,544399,546320,cool technology sustained performance is
Cn3_3A_j5-E,546320,548640,important and with the liquid cool
Cn3_3A_j5-E,548640,550720,technology that we've got 2.0 on here
Cn3_3A_j5-E,550720,553440,we've also got a 32 large vapor chamber
Cn3_3A_j5-E,553440,555519,so that just makes things
Cn3_3A_j5-E,555519,557680,much more sustained over a longer period
Cn3_3A_j5-E,557680,559440,of time when you are gaming and keeping
Cn3_3A_j5-E,559440,560640,that heat down
Cn3_3A_j5-E,560640,563120,so the x4 gt is powered by that mediatek
Cn3_3A_j5-E,563120,566160,demensity 8100 and like the f4 we're
Cn3_3A_j5-E,566160,567519,also getting that liquid cool 2
Cn3_3A_j5-E,567519,571040,technology and ufs 3.1 lp tdr5 all the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,571040,572640,good stuff and also one of the most
Cn3_3A_j5-E,572640,574560,powerful and efficient processors you
Cn3_3A_j5-E,574560,576320,can get in a phone they're both
Cn3_3A_j5-E,576320,579279,incredibly capable chips as you say uh
Cn3_3A_j5-E,579279,580800,five nanometers on that one seven on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,580800,582800,this one so the dimensions a little bit
Cn3_3A_j5-E,582800,585360,newer but they're both well they'll run
Cn3_3A_j5-E,585360,586880,everything you throw at it when you've
Cn3_3A_j5-E,586880,589800,got 270 hertz touch sampling as well as
Cn3_3A_j5-E,589800,593120,144 hertz lcd display it's just going to
Cn3_3A_j5-E,593120,594880,make things very responsive so as soon
Cn3_3A_j5-E,594880,596800,as you touch a trigger you'll be seeing
Cn3_3A_j5-E,596800,599120,that response uh without any delay so
Cn3_3A_j5-E,599120,600720,that's something that's really good i
Cn3_3A_j5-E,600720,602880,know both phones do get a glass five on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,602880,604800,the front keep them protected uh and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,604800,606800,actually the f4 we have 900 nips of
Cn3_3A_j5-E,606800,608399,brightness uh in high brightness mode
Cn3_3A_j5-E,608399,610560,and also we can peak at 1300 nits with
Cn3_3A_j5-E,610560,612240,hdr so if you're watching you know
Cn3_3A_j5-E,612240,614079,videos and movies and if you're like me
Cn3_3A_j5-E,614079,615920,with these on all the time you're gonna
Cn3_3A_j5-E,615920,617760,need a great phone and you you can see
Cn3_3A_j5-E,617760,619360,that very clearly which is i mean
Cn3_3A_j5-E,619360,620880,they're both great for entertainment and
Cn3_3A_j5-E,620880,621920,gaming but they've got slightly
Cn3_3A_j5-E,621920,623200,different
Cn3_3A_j5-E,623200,625040,slight different directions there so the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,625040,627519,f4 is powered by the snapdragon 870
Cn3_3A_j5-E,627519,628880,which is still one of the best chips on
Cn3_3A_j5-E,628880,631040,the market for performance both in terms
Cn3_3A_j5-E,631040,633040,of high clock speeds and also the isp
Cn3_3A_j5-E,633040,635279,for the camera and together with poco's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,635279,638000,liquid cool technology 2.0 and also the
Cn3_3A_j5-E,638000,640079,bigger vapor chamber cooler inside for
Cn3_3A_j5-E,640079,642800,the money this is a pretty solid setup
Cn3_3A_j5-E,642800,644800,battery life it's important it's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,644800,646320,important we want something that can
Cn3_3A_j5-E,646320,648240,last a long time unlike
Cn3_3A_j5-E,648240,649200,tom detective
Cn3_3A_j5-E,649200,652560,[Laughter]
Cn3_3A_j5-E,652560,653680,wow
Cn3_3A_j5-E,653680,655519,wow 5 000
Cn3_3A_j5-E,655519,658560,okay 5 080 million power battery that's
Cn3_3A_j5-E,658560,660320,a that's a pretty sizable battery yeah
Cn3_3A_j5-E,660320,662160,yours is bigger than mine as they say uh
Cn3_3A_j5-E,662160,663680,no this is actually got the free 500
Cn3_3A_j5-E,663680,665600,million power battery um but i guess
Cn3_3A_j5-E,665600,666720,obviously that being more gaming
Cn3_3A_j5-E,666720,668640,oriented that yeah you are gonna that
