gzzfgX0TkG0,399,2639,what's up guys i'm random frank p back
gzzfgX0TkG0,2639,4640,with another episode of cool tech under
gzzfgX0TkG0,4640,7200,fifty dollars for august the series we
gzzfgX0TkG0,7200,8480,show off some of the best tech you can
gzzfgX0TkG0,8480,9200,find
gzzfgX0TkG0,9200,11200,under that price point see anything you
gzzfgX0TkG0,11200,12559,like today i'll have it all listed for
gzzfgX0TkG0,12559,14080,you in the description down below so you
gzzfgX0TkG0,14080,15040,can check it out
gzzfgX0TkG0,15040,16800,and as always shout out to last month's
gzzfgX0TkG0,16800,18400,winners i've been in contact with you so
gzzfgX0TkG0,18400,19600,you can claim your tech from last
gzzfgX0TkG0,19600,21119,month's episode and if you're trying to
gzzfgX0TkG0,21119,21600,win
gzzfgX0TkG0,21600,23039,drop a thumbs up and also leave a
gzzfgX0TkG0,23039,24720,comment on your favorite item that you
gzzfgX0TkG0,24720,26240,like in today's video
gzzfgX0TkG0,26240,29119,but more importantly only 33 of you are
gzzfgX0TkG0,29119,30160,actually subscribed
gzzfgX0TkG0,30160,32480,which means 66 percent are just stopping
gzzfgX0TkG0,32480,35280,by and not hitting that sub button so
gzzfgX0TkG0,35280,37040,change that because obviously i'm only
gzzfgX0TkG0,37040,38640,going to pick subscribers
gzzfgX0TkG0,38640,41280,and if we flip flop that ratio we would
gzzfgX0TkG0,41280,42800,hit 2 million subs
gzzfgX0TkG0,42800,45039,today so if you like the content if you
gzzfgX0TkG0,45039,46000,like the channel
gzzfgX0TkG0,46000,49120,don't forget subscribe now first up is a
gzzfgX0TkG0,49120,51600,super clean and minimal looking lamp
gzzfgX0TkG0,51600,52239,absolutely
gzzfgX0TkG0,52239,54399,love this it's called the me lamp or
gzzfgX0TkG0,54399,56079,something like that i actually first saw
gzzfgX0TkG0,56079,57760,this in a room tour project submission
gzzfgX0TkG0,57760,59520,and fell in love with it and was super
gzzfgX0TkG0,59520,60480,shocked to see
gzzfgX0TkG0,60480,62879,it was only like 40 bucks i mean tell me
gzzfgX0TkG0,62879,64320,this isn't the perfect clean and minimal
gzzfgX0TkG0,64320,64960,lamp right
gzzfgX0TkG0,64960,66400,so built-in on the front is a little
gzzfgX0TkG0,66400,68320,dial that's obviously for controlling
gzzfgX0TkG0,68320,69920,the brightness as well as the color
gzzfgX0TkG0,69920,70720,temperature
gzzfgX0TkG0,70720,74080,all the way from 2700 kelvin to 6500
gzzfgX0TkG0,74080,75759,kelvin so you can really dial it in
gzzfgX0TkG0,75759,77439,and it also says it has four different
gzzfgX0TkG0,77439,79520,lighting modes things for like you know
gzzfgX0TkG0,79520,81200,like a warm glow at night or when you're
gzzfgX0TkG0,81200,82960,reading but obviously you can just you
gzzfgX0TkG0,82960,84640,know manually turn it yourself and dial
gzzfgX0TkG0,84640,86000,in that lighting depending on
gzzfgX0TkG0,86000,87680,your situation and how much light you
gzzfgX0TkG0,87680,89439,need in the room for your desk
gzzfgX0TkG0,89439,90720,what i also really like is the fact that
gzzfgX0TkG0,90720,92799,it's controllable through apple homekit
gzzfgX0TkG0,92799,94240,also through siri
gzzfgX0TkG0,94240,97360,google assistant and amazon alexa it's a
gzzfgX0TkG0,97360,98799,lamp there's not really too many other
gzzfgX0TkG0,98799,100240,physical features to it but
gzzfgX0TkG0,100240,102320,like i said before the visuals is the
gzzfgX0TkG0,102320,104479,reason why i bought it i love that super
gzzfgX0TkG0,104479,105360,clean aesthetic
gzzfgX0TkG0,105360,107759,and hell for 40 bucks it was a steal i
gzzfgX0TkG0,107759,109360,currently saw on amazon it was just
gzzfgX0TkG0,109360,110880,around 50 bucks but
gzzfgX0TkG0,110880,112799,that's amazon for you prices are always
gzzfgX0TkG0,112799,114000,fluctuating if you can
gzzfgX0TkG0,114000,116640,find it definitely grab it now next is
gzzfgX0TkG0,116640,118399,something i was admittedly thinking of
gzzfgX0TkG0,118399,119920,not putting in this episode and maybe
gzzfgX0TkG0,119920,122000,saving it for like a holiday edition
gzzfgX0TkG0,122000,123680,for like a stocking stuffer or a gift
gzzfgX0TkG0,123680,125040,idea for someone else but
gzzfgX0TkG0,125040,126799,it really is cool and i'm sure a lot of
gzzfgX0TkG0,126799,128479,you could definitely find it useful
gzzfgX0TkG0,128479,129759,especially because we have back to
gzzfgX0TkG0,129759,131680,school season coming up so maybe you can
gzzfgX0TkG0,131680,133599,grab this for all your devices because
gzzfgX0TkG0,133599,135280,it's this really bizarre
gzzfgX0TkG0,135280,138640,all-in-one multi-device cleaning kit
gzzfgX0TkG0,138640,140319,so you've probably got a dirty phone
gzzfgX0TkG0,140319,141680,laptop a tablet
gzzfgX0TkG0,141680,143200,this little thing will help you polish
gzzfgX0TkG0,143200,145360,up all those ports clean all that pocket
gzzfgX0TkG0,145360,146080,lint out
gzzfgX0TkG0,146080,147920,so six tools are built in it also comes
gzzfgX0TkG0,147920,149440,with a microfiber cloth
gzzfgX0TkG0,149440,151920,and this cleaning solution but tools one
gzzfgX0TkG0,151920,153680,through three are for cleaning the ports
gzzfgX0TkG0,153680,155440,or like the lightning usb c port on your
gzzfgX0TkG0,155440,156080,device
gzzfgX0TkG0,156080,158319,four and five are actually ports uh for
gzzfgX0TkG0,158319,160160,cleaning the pins on your cables
gzzfgX0TkG0,160160,161920,so again with lightning ports especially
gzzfgX0TkG0,161920,163599,uh it could get like the blackened pins
gzzfgX0TkG0,163599,165120,over time due to just damage and
gzzfgX0TkG0,165120,166080,corrosion
gzzfgX0TkG0,166080,168080,these will nicely clean that up for you
gzzfgX0TkG0,168080,169840,there's also a brush tool for again like
gzzfgX0TkG0,169840,171840,cleaning speakers the microphone
gzzfgX0TkG0,171840,174160,uh the earpiece you just can really
gzzfgX0TkG0,174160,176000,polish up your phone and clean out all
gzzfgX0TkG0,176000,177360,that lint because i know for me
gzzfgX0TkG0,177360,178159,especially
gzzfgX0TkG0,178159,179519,like you probably don't think about it
gzzfgX0TkG0,179519,181680,too much but considering how often our
gzzfgX0TkG0,181680,183040,phone is in our pocket
gzzfgX0TkG0,183040,185599,there is just so much lint that gets
gzzfgX0TkG0,185599,186319,crammed up
gzzfgX0TkG0,186319,188080,into your charging port regardless of
gzzfgX0TkG0,188080,189840,whether you just solely like wirelessly
gzzfgX0TkG0,189840,192239,charge or what there is probably a ton
gzzfgX0TkG0,192239,194560,of gunk crammed up in your charging port
gzzfgX0TkG0,194560,196080,and i know for me i use the one tool
gzzfgX0TkG0,196080,196959,right away
gzzfgX0TkG0,196959,198640,scraped out like pretty much a belly
gzzfgX0TkG0,198640,200480,button's worth but also i can appreciate
gzzfgX0TkG0,200480,202080,the fact that we still do have that
gzzfgX0TkG0,202080,203760,cleaning solution included so we can
gzzfgX0TkG0,203760,205550,polish up the ports
gzzfgX0TkG0,205550,207200,[Music]
gzzfgX0TkG0,207200,208640,so if you've noticed maybe your cable's
gzzfgX0TkG0,208640,210560,been cutting out perhaps um maybe it's
gzzfgX0TkG0,210560,212319,not even a faulty cable it could just be
gzzfgX0TkG0,212319,213920,because the pins and the connectors
gzzfgX0TkG0,213920,215440,are dirty themselves so the fact that
gzzfgX0TkG0,215440,216959,the tool has a solution
gzzfgX0TkG0,216959,219120,and extra ports to clean up the cable i
gzzfgX0TkG0,219120,220640,thought it was a nice little idea so
gzzfgX0TkG0,220640,222159,definitely a useful device
gzzfgX0TkG0,222159,224239,throw it in your bag your backpack a
gzzfgX0TkG0,224239,226159,drawer always have it on hand
gzzfgX0TkG0,226159,228319,and it comes in under 30 bucks that's
gzzfgX0TkG0,228319,229920,why i said before possibly like a good
gzzfgX0TkG0,229920,231760,you know gift idea for the holidays
gzzfgX0TkG0,231760,233680,but uh maybe a good gift for someone
gzzfgX0TkG0,233680,234879,else regardless of the holidays if
gzzfgX0TkG0,234879,235920,you're feeling generous
gzzfgX0TkG0,235920,238560,buy this for a friend next what if i
gzzfgX0TkG0,238560,240000,told you there was a razer viper
gzzfgX0TkG0,240000,242640,ultimate clone that was lighter slightly
gzzfgX0TkG0,242640,243280,smaller
gzzfgX0TkG0,243280,247080,and a third of the price meet the deluxe
gzzfgX0TkG0,247080,249920,m800db this clone has exploded in
gzzfgX0TkG0,249920,251680,popularity out there for that exact
gzzfgX0TkG0,251680,253280,reason it's pretty much a
gzzfgX0TkG0,253280,255519,smaller viper ultimate you can see it's
gzzfgX0TkG0,255519,257440,nearly identical in shape
gzzfgX0TkG0,257440,261280,but you're only paying 40 versus 120.
gzzfgX0TkG0,261280,263280,inside the box it comes with a usbc
gzzfgX0TkG0,263280,264400,charging cable
gzzfgX0TkG0,264400,266400,a wireless dongle for and an extra pair
gzzfgX0TkG0,266400,268080,of feet they are a stock teflon
gzzfgX0TkG0,268080,269520,so decking this out with something like
gzzfgX0TkG0,269520,271120,a nice hyper glides will definitely do
gzzfgX0TkG0,271120,272639,the trick but my first impression of
gzzfgX0TkG0,272639,274479,this just really blew me away because
gzzfgX0TkG0,274479,277120,if you were blindfolded you would 100
gzzfgX0TkG0,277120,278800,think it's a viper ultimate the only
gzzfgX0TkG0,278800,280639,physical difference really is the dpi
gzzfgX0TkG0,280639,282160,button is now on top instead of the
gzzfgX0TkG0,282160,282880,bottom
gzzfgX0TkG0,282880,284720,and there aren't the right side buttons
gzzfgX0TkG0,284720,285680,but there are still the buttons on the
gzzfgX0TkG0,285680,286240,left side
gzzfgX0TkG0,286240,287759,and we even have an rgb light strip with
gzzfgX0TkG0,287759,290000,the butt now say what in terms of size
gzzfgX0TkG0,290000,292240,it's three millimeters shorter in length
gzzfgX0TkG0,292240,294160,a three millimeter smaller at the grip
gzzfgX0TkG0,294160,294720,width
gzzfgX0TkG0,294720,296800,and two millimeters smaller at its hips
gzzfgX0TkG0,296800,298240,but the height of the front flare in the
gzzfgX0TkG0,298240,300000,top of the mouse is the same as the
gzzfgX0TkG0,300000,300560,viper
gzzfgX0TkG0,300560,302560,and it also comes in four grams lighter
gzzfgX0TkG0,302560,305600,at just 70 grams versus 74 grams
gzzfgX0TkG0,305600,307919,it's not quite at the size of like the
gzzfgX0TkG0,307919,309680,viper mini but hey i mean it's still
gzzfgX0TkG0,309680,311039,smaller and lighter than the viper
gzzfgX0TkG0,311039,311520,ultimate
gzzfgX0TkG0,311520,312880,the main difference really is going to
gzzfgX0TkG0,312880,314320,come in with the wireless technology
gzzfgX0TkG0,314320,315280,they're using
gzzfgX0TkG0,315280,317680,obviously razer is a multi-million
gzzfgX0TkG0,317680,319360,probably billion dollar company
gzzfgX0TkG0,319360,321280,and their wireless technology and sensor
gzzfgX0TkG0,321280,322720,is admittedly going to be better
gzzfgX0TkG0,322720,325440,and here we have a paw 3335 sensor that
gzzfgX0TkG0,325440,327520,goes up to 16 000 dpi
gzzfgX0TkG0,327520,330080,but the switches in these are kale 4.0
gzzfgX0TkG0,330080,332160,reds and they have a 60 million lifespan
gzzfgX0TkG0,332160,334000,and all around the quality control here
gzzfgX0TkG0,334000,335840,it's really a solid mouse
gzzfgX0TkG0,335840,337520,gaming with it since i've been mating
gzzfgX0TkG0,337520,340560,the viper ultimate since release in 2019
gzzfgX0TkG0,340560,342160,i mean it when i say it like switching
gzzfgX0TkG0,342160,344240,over to this it didn't feel like a
gzzfgX0TkG0,344240,344800,difference
gzzfgX0TkG0,344800,347440,at all this mouse is so on par with
gzzfgX0TkG0,347440,349120,diaper ultimate for a fraction of the
gzzfgX0TkG0,349120,351120,price that it is really just
gzzfgX0TkG0,351120,352720,impressive that's the best way to say
gzzfgX0TkG0,352720,354479,it's impressive for 40
gzzfgX0TkG0,354479,356160,dollars so if you never wanted to deck
gzzfgX0TkG0,356160,357680,out the money for the viper ultimate or
gzzfgX0TkG0,357680,359520,you've wanted to really try it out but
gzzfgX0TkG0,359520,360400,not you know
gzzfgX0TkG0,360400,363680,take that plunge and m800db 40 bucks
gzzfgX0TkG0,363680,366000,now moving right along you know me you
gzzfgX0TkG0,366000,366800,know the channel
gzzfgX0TkG0,366800,368800,you know this series you know what i
gzzfgX0TkG0,368800,369840,like
gzzfgX0TkG0,369840,372639,and i will never stop showing off cool
gzzfgX0TkG0,372639,374400,macro pads
gzzfgX0TkG0,374400,377360,dials knobs anything like that that
gzzfgX0TkG0,377360,379280,could help people out in terms of macros
gzzfgX0TkG0,379280,381039,and extra functions
gzzfgX0TkG0,381039,384160,i'm telling you i'll never stop
gzzfgX0TkG0,384160,387199,no ragrets so meet the
gzzfgX0TkG0,387199,391520,so meet the huion kd 100 keypad
gzzfgX0TkG0,391520,394319,it's wireless has 18 programmable keys
gzzfgX0TkG0,394319,396639,plus a multifunctional dial up top
gzzfgX0TkG0,396639,398400,and while it was made for their own like
gzzfgX0TkG0,398400,400080,drawing tablets and stuff you don't
gzzfgX0TkG0,400080,401919,need it it's not required you can use
gzzfgX0TkG0,401919,404000,this without a drawing tablet and
gzzfgX0TkG0,404000,405680,set it to be a bunch of different macros
gzzfgX0TkG0,405680,408479,functions and commands controls yes
gzzfgX0TkG0,408479,409919,so with it being wireless it actually
gzzfgX0TkG0,409919,411919,has a 100 hour battery life which is
gzzfgX0TkG0,411919,413199,definitely pretty impressive
gzzfgX0TkG0,413199,414880,you could also choose to use it wired
gzzfgX0TkG0,414880,416479,because it has usb c port
gzzfgX0TkG0,416479,418479,thank you but since it is so compact
gzzfgX0TkG0,418479,420000,like a standard keypad that you would
gzzfgX0TkG0,420000,421440,buy out there or people who buy like
gzzfgX0TkG0,421440,422560,numpads and stuff
gzzfgX0TkG0,422560,424400,the added functionality is really
gzzfgX0TkG0,424400,426639,impressive so for the 18 programmable
gzzfgX0TkG0,426639,427199,keys
gzzfgX0TkG0,427199,428639,the actual keys themselves are like the
gzzfgX0TkG0,428639,430479,scissor keys you would find on a laptop
gzzfgX0TkG0,430479,431680,so it's not going to be like a really
gzzfgX0TkG0,431680,432560,satisfying
gzzfgX0TkG0,432560,434479,like mechanical switch for example but
gzzfgX0TkG0,434479,435759,honestly with something like this
gzzfgX0TkG0,435759,437360,not too big of a deal but what i really
gzzfgX0TkG0,437360,438720,like about the dial is it has these
gzzfgX0TkG0,438720,440639,super satisfying clicks when you rotate
gzzfgX0TkG0,440639,441039,it
gzzfgX0TkG0,441039,442479,there's actually a button in the middle
gzzfgX0TkG0,442479,444080,of the dial which lets you actually
gzzfgX0TkG0,444080,445520,change up on the fly
gzzfgX0TkG0,445520,447280,what the dial does so inside the
gzzfgX0TkG0,447280,448560,software you can go in
gzzfgX0TkG0,448560,450960,and really reprogram everything on here
gzzfgX0TkG0,450960,452639,you can set each key to do things like a
gzzfgX0TkG0,452639,454479,keyboard stroke a mouse click
gzzfgX0TkG0,454479,456240,i'm running certain programs or system
gzzfgX0TkG0,456240,458319,applications multimedia

gzzfgX0TkG0,475840,477520,timeline make it a volume wheel

gzzfgX0TkG0,488800,490000,video editing
gzzfgX0TkG0,490000,493280,macros for gaming 3d design animation

gzzfgX0TkG0,495840,496879,on your desk
gzzfgX0TkG0,496879,499599,bunch of functions right at arm's reach
gzzfgX0TkG0,499599,501039,i'll never stop
gzzfgX0TkG0,501039,504479,showing off knobs macro pads keypads
gzzfgX0TkG0,504479,506960,anything cool 50 bucks hell of a good
gzzfgX0TkG0,506960,507520,deal
gzzfgX0TkG0,507520,509120,then last but not least we have the
gzzfgX0TkG0,509120,510879,genki shadow cast
gzzfgX0TkG0,510879,513919,and this little hdmi device lets you use
gzzfgX0TkG0,513919,516719,a laptop for example as like a monitor
gzzfgX0TkG0,516719,518959,or at its own display to play and record
gzzfgX0TkG0,518959,519518,games
gzzfgX0TkG0,519518,521039,things like using your laptop to play
gzzfgX0TkG0,521039,522560,your nintendo switch your
gzzfgX0TkG0,522560,525839,xbox a ps5 really any hdmi device you
gzzfgX0TkG0,525839,527279,can hook up to the shadow cast
gzzfgX0TkG0,527279,529839,and now have it displayed or captured on
gzzfgX0TkG0,529839,530640,your laptop
gzzfgX0TkG0,530640,533279,or a pc really it's essentially a more
gzzfgX0TkG0,533279,534240,affordable
gzzfgX0TkG0,534240,537120,elgato capture card instead of being 200
gzzfgX0TkG0,537120,537920,this little guy
gzzfgX0TkG0,537920,539760,is just 50. they do have their own
gzzfgX0TkG0,539760,541360,arcade software you can go in and
gzzfgX0TkG0,541360,542959,download to do things like monitor your
gzzfgX0TkG0,542959,544320,gameplay for capturing
gzzfgX0TkG0,544320,546560,um but also you can just use like obs
gzzfgX0TkG0,546560,548080,and that'll work just fine as well
gzzfgX0TkG0,548080,549760,and just like any other capture card if
gzzfgX0TkG0,549760,551440,you want you can use it with like a
gzzfgX0TkG0,551440,554160,dslr and have it be like a webcam type
gzzfgX0TkG0,554160,554640,thing
gzzfgX0TkG0,554640,556240,so i'll admit when i first saw this and
gzzfgX0TkG0,556240,558320,picked it up i thought it turned any
gzzfgX0TkG0,558320,560320,device into like a display
gzzfgX0TkG0,560320,562480,not so much like a capture card like a
gzzfgX0TkG0,562480,563920,pass-through device like this
gzzfgX0TkG0,563920,565760,is but i just thought your laptop would
gzzfgX0TkG0,565760,567200,be turned into a monitor which something
gzzfgX0TkG0,567200,568080,you can't do
gzzfgX0TkG0,568080,570240,you know uh but for being what it is
gzzfgX0TkG0,570240,571120,again a
gzzfgX0TkG0,571120,573040,much cheaper alternative to an elgato
gzzfgX0TkG0,573040,574399,capture card out there
gzzfgX0TkG0,574399,576959,50 bucks versus 200 and i've showed off
gzzfgX0TkG0,576959,578399,a lot of you know alternative capture
gzzfgX0TkG0,578399,580399,cards in the past and hdmi capture cards
gzzfgX0TkG0,580399,581120,like this
gzzfgX0TkG0,581120,583519,uh so this one giving you a just another
gzzfgX0TkG0,583519,585120,option out there to pick from
gzzfgX0TkG0,585120,588000,for fifty dollars and there's like point
gzzfgX0TkG0,588000,589680,two seconds of delay and stuff for
gzzfgX0TkG0,589680,590320,capturing
gzzfgX0TkG0,590320,591519,so again with a lot of your capture
gzzfgX0TkG0,591519,593360,cards out there that's pretty standard
gzzfgX0TkG0,593360,594399,to normal
gzzfgX0TkG0,594399,596320,but again if you wanna find a quick and
gzzfgX0TkG0,596320,598480,cheap way to rip your gameplay
