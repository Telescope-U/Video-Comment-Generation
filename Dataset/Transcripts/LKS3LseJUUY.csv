LKS3LseJUUY,27303,28885,She knows everybody!
LKS3LseJUUY,28960,30884,We have to talk about the hole.
LKS3LseJUUY,30960,31486,The what?
LKS3LseJUUY,31561,35365,Only in Paris: You can ambush people at Fashion front row
LKS3LseJUUY,35440,36605,and get away with it!
LKS3LseJUUY,37920,39987,Miss Fashun talks to Manu Rios!
LKS3LseJUUY,41320,43053,And to Jonathan Anderson!
LKS3LseJUUY,43200,46272,We're all in a weird psychological state anyway.
LKS3LseJUUY,48940,50926,"I'm Miss Fashion, and I'm going to get the good shot,"
LKS3LseJUUY,51001,52045,I'm coming in.
LKS3LseJUUY,52120,54590,Almost all the Sex Education stars.
LKS3LseJUUY,54665,55807,- How shocked? - Shocked!
LKS3LseJUUY,55882,58874,She watches the show and you'll understand everything.
LKS3LseJUUY,58949,62285,"You're watching Miss Fashion, where everybody is front row."
LKS3LseJUUY,62360,63245,Where I am.
LKS3LseJUUY,63320,64122,Follow me.

LKS3LseJUUY,68200,70759,"Architecture, sex, divinity."
LKS3LseJUUY,71614,74525,"Leave a comment and binge on all my other videos,"
LKS3LseJUUY,74600,77325,including the first episode of Miss Fashion.
LKS3LseJUUY,77400,79205,You're watching Miss Fashion.
LKS3LseJUUY,79280,81119,God bless you.
LKS3LseJUUY,87120,89520,"Hi. I Miss Fame. And I'm 75 years old,"
LKS3LseJUUY,89595,92085,reporting live from Fashion Week.
LKS3LseJUUY,92160,96005,Everything about me is old except for my ideas and my lashes.
LKS3LseJUUY,96080,98005,We're at the Loewe menswear show.
LKS3LseJUUY,98080,101405,Everybody's shaking with excitement about 10 minutes away.
LKS3LseJUUY,101480,105925,"The guests are going to be seated on these transparent acrylic seats,"
LKS3LseJUUY,106000,108640,so they'll be floating in this seaside space.
LKS3LseJUUY,108716,112365,Loewe is a Spanish luxury brand owned by LVMH.
LKS3LseJUUY,112440,114725,I wish I was owned by LVMH.
LKS3LseJUUY,114800,115972,Don't you wish?
LKS3LseJUUY,116064,118106,"This sand is a part of the art piece,"
LKS3LseJUUY,118181,121165,an actual art installation we're existing within.
LKS3LseJUUY,121240,126040,So I think it's very important to keep the history in my long-term memory.
LKS3LseJUUY,126727,130119,Why not? I'm going to have it signed after the show.
LKS3LseJUUY,130837,132445,"A guest, over here."
LKS3LseJUUY,132520,134205,Good morning. What did you have for breakfast?
LKS3LseJUUY,134280,138000,I had nothing for breakfast. Except chewing-gum. That's what I had.
LKS3LseJUUY,139077,140125,Great!
LKS3LseJUUY,140200,142040,What did you have for breakfast?
LKS3LseJUUY,142649,144445,The crust in the corners of my mouth.
LKS3LseJUUY,144520,145685,What did you have for breakfast?
LKS3LseJUUY,145760,148627,- I didn't eat. I didn't have time! - Great!
LKS3LseJUUY,149086,150403,"I overslept, basically."
LKS3LseJUUY,150478,151478,Lucky!
LKS3LseJUUY,152168,155090,But I had to run to the show instead.
LKS3LseJUUY,155165,156444,"By the way, you look incredible."
LKS3LseJUUY,156520,157925,Thank you very much.
LKS3LseJUUY,158000,159315,What do you love about Loewe?
LKS3LseJUUY,159390,161885,"The colours, the vibrancy and the energy."
LKS3LseJUUY,161960,164885,- 100% agreed. - There you go.
LKS3LseJUUY,164960,167840,One more question. What are the holes for?
LKS3LseJUUY,169753,172205,To look at my beautiful ankles. Aren't they beautiful?
LKS3LseJUUY,172280,175573,They're quite stunning. Agreed. 100%. They're so good.
LKS3LseJUUY,175648,176648,Great.
LKS3LseJUUY,176922,180314,What's your passion for fashion in regards to Loewe?
LKS3LseJUUY,180475,183605,I feel like I first got introduced to the brand by Steve Lacy.
LKS3LseJUUY,183680,185605,I got the chance to wear their stuff on stage.
LKS3LseJUUY,185680,188004,"Here's the thing. This looks so comfortable,"
LKS3LseJUUY,188080,190885,and I don't know comfort. I've never known comfort.
LKS3LseJUUY,190960,193265,"But, fashion is pain."
LKS3LseJUUY,193340,196360,"It looks comfortable. But with my lower back, there's a difference."
LKS3LseJUUY,197081,199724,That's because we're not as young as we once were.
LKS3LseJUUY,199800,201285,It happens to the best of us.
LKS3LseJUUY,201360,202920,I try to drink a lot of water.
LKS3LseJUUY,204202,205560,May I bother you?
LKS3LseJUUY,206223,209863,I was asking if I could sit on you. Do you mind?
LKS3LseJUUY,209947,210735,No.
LKS3LseJUUY,210810,213631,"It's the coat. It's really quite inviting. I mean, look at it."
LKS3LseJUUY,213706,214845,Can we see the back?
LKS3LseJUUY,214920,215789,Of course.
LKS3LseJUUY,215864,218525,"I want to ride it, like a pony, honey. Like a pony."
LKS3LseJUUY,218600,220536,It's actually quite comfortable.
LKS3LseJUUY,220611,223325,I feel like it's got my back. For sure.
LKS3LseJUUY,223400,226564,"For sure. If you don't mind, I'm going to knock on your back door."
LKS3LseJUUY,229182,230605,- Hello? - Who's there?
LKS3LseJUUY,230680,232359,- It's me. - Me who?
LKS3LseJUUY,232689,233689,Miss Fashion.
LKS3LseJUUY,233993,235463,Am I seeing double?
LKS3LseJUUY,236640,239507,"May I interview you, two beautiful beings."
LKS3LseJUUY,240340,242698,- Names? - Mohammed. Humaid.
LKS3LseJUUY,242773,243581,Incredible.
LKS3LseJUUY,243656,245026,We are from the Middle East.
LKS3LseJUUY,245101,247768,Absolutely brilliant. And who is cuter?
LKS3LseJUUY,248200,250685,- I don't know. I think you. - I think you.
LKS3LseJUUY,250760,253084,"I mean, come on. You can't choose."
LKS3LseJUUY,253160,254960,Perfection. It does exist.
LKS3LseJUUY,255120,256885,What's your favourite piece you're wearing today?
LKS3LseJUUY,256959,259122,My favourite piece? Actually I love these shoes.
LKS3LseJUUY,259198,263040,They're basically just these two big slabs of paper wrapped around my foot.
LKS3LseJUUY,263813,265679,See? And then there you go.
LKS3LseJUUY,266172,267172,Beautiful.
LKS3LseJUUY,267422,268393,Super great.
LKS3LseJUUY,268469,270965,"- This is quite nice, too. - This is cute."
LKS3LseJUUY,271040,272485,I like this front fit.
LKS3LseJUUY,272560,276578,Because it's like big but then I have a little bit of my silhouette.
LKS3LseJUUY,276653,279682,- Classy but sexy. - But hot.
LKS3LseJUUY,280856,282323,We're in love. It's super good.
LKS3LseJUUY,282400,285639,I couldn't stop looking because your eyes are drawn there.
LKS3LseJUUY,287124,290916,Your eyes are drawn to this beautiful face. But then also this structure.
LKS3LseJUUY,290991,293174,"But then the body, darling. The body. Boobs."
LKS3LseJUUY,293249,294249,Thank you.
LKS3LseJUUY,295568,299245,"You're like, I'm completely offended. You cannot be offended when you're at Loewe."
LKS3LseJUUY,299320,299726,What?
LKS3LseJUUY,299801,301643,"We're looking for BryanBoy,"
LKS3LseJUUY,301718,303004,where is she?
LKS3LseJUUY,303080,305245,I got her. We've caught her.
LKS3LseJUUY,305320,306717,"Bryan? Bryan, it's me."
LKS3LseJUUY,306793,308725,It's coming in hot.
LKS3LseJUUY,308800,310280,Miss Fashion reporting live.
LKS3LseJUUY,311983,314565,"We're here at Loewe, I'm very excited, we are."
LKS3LseJUUY,314640,317805,And I'm proud to introduce to you Miss Hillary Clinton.
LKS3LseJUUY,317880,322760,"You know, today's a Democratic convention, but she flew over to Paris."
LKS3LseJUUY,323418,326440,- I'm charmed. - Exactly. Just to support Loewe.
LKS3LseJUUY,326566,329040,Gorgeous. And what did you have for breakfast?
LKS3LseJUUY,329596,330805,His soul.
LKS3LseJUUY,330880,333680,How are you feeling since that snatching?
LKS3LseJUUY,334508,336440,I feel endangered.
LKS3LseJUUY,337120,338800,You heard it here first.
LKS3LseJUUY,346303,350207,"If you're still watching Miss Fashion, you should subscribe."
LKS3LseJUUY,350498,352897,"And in Miss Fashion topics, ageing."
LKS3LseJUUY,354997,357570,I like being older. I'm turning 40 in March.
LKS3LseJUUY,357645,358645,Amazing.
LKS3LseJUUY,358800,363263,"So I'm proud to say I'm old. I mean, we are only as old as how we look."
LKS3LseJUUY,363338,365965,You are very right.
LKS3LseJUUY,366040,369805,Try to Google image what a 40 year old man looks like.
LKS3LseJUUY,369880,370920,And compare.
LKS3LseJUUY,371571,372771,Stop doing it!
LKS3LseJUUY,373160,374765,"God, it is so inappropriate."
LKS3LseJUUY,374840,376125,She's aggressive.
LKS3LseJUUY,376200,378125,You should sit. The show's about to begin.
LKS3LseJUUY,378200,380245,- I can't find my seat. - I can't find mine either.
LKS3LseJUUY,380320,382204,We can sit together.
LKS3LseJUUY,382279,384685,Let's all sit for the show to begin.
LKS3LseJUUY,384760,386449,"People, sit."
LKS3LseJUUY,394184,396440,3…2…1…Go.
LKS3LseJUUY,409363,412691,They swoosh through the ribbons on the Loewe beach.
LKS3LseJUUY,412796,417000,"The Loewe designer, Jonathan Anderson, is here to explain everything."
LKS3LseJUUY,417960,420587,Reporting live. Miss Fashion reporting live.
LKS3LseJUUY,420663,422485,I just got to experience the show.
LKS3LseJUUY,422560,424125,"Which one? Honey, put it on."
LKS3LseJUUY,424200,425525,Press it like the family.
LKS3LseJUUY,425600,427735,The nails must stay on.
LKS3LseJUUY,427810,431085,"Jonathan, let's talk about the inspiration for the show."
LKS3LseJUUY,431160,433285,The set is done by Joe and Edgar.
LKS3LseJUUY,433360,437560,"I had actually bought a painting and they were in the painting, weirdly."
LKS3LseJUUY,437636,442965,They do these amazing art installations on Fire Island and different places in the world.
LKS3LseJUUY,443040,446165,There was something about them that drew me in.
LKS3LseJUUY,446240,448893,So I kind of started this before we had done the collection.
LKS3LseJUUY,448969,452725,So I kind of add this sort of like abstracted backgrounds.
LKS3LseJUUY,452800,454774,And so they moved to Europe to come and do it.
LKS3LseJUUY,454849,458040,So we're gonna install them in different parts of the world.
LKS3LseJUUY,458839,461763,"It's making me feel like the beach vibes, a bit like Fire Island."
LKS3LseJUUY,461838,463160,Is there any connection?
LKS3LseJUUY,464206,467525,That's why this project was born. We started making them on Fire Island.
LKS3LseJUUY,467600,469801,It's a good feeling. It makes you feel like summer.
LKS3LseJUUY,469876,472885,It does feel a bit euphoric.
LKS3LseJUUY,472960,475097,It's meant to be inviting to bring people together.
LKS3LseJUUY,475172,477365,So that's sort of what we wanted to do.
LKS3LseJUUY,477440,480245,We're kind of bringing a little bit of that here.
LKS3LseJUUY,480320,482814,"This sort of colour, the fantasy, the sand."
LKS3LseJUUY,482889,484976,It's caught inside of my heels.
LKS3LseJUUY,485051,485844,I'm sorry about that.
LKS3LseJUUY,485919,487765,This is what love really is.
LKS3LseJUUY,487840,491040,It's about coming together and fixing each other's straps.
LKS3LseJUUY,492229,494123,"I think there's something childlike about that, you know,"
LKS3LseJUUY,494198,496999,"as nearly going through one of those things that clean cars, you know?"
LKS3LseJUUY,498228,501125,"The Loewe Menswear collection includes lights,"
LKS3LseJUUY,501200,502880,illuminating the bodies.
LKS3LseJUUY,503080,506197,I just wanted to kind of look at the set of things that are real and not real.
LKS3LseJUUY,506272,509001,"This idea of, are we becoming,"
LKS3LseJUUY,509076,512164,like we fall in the computer and are part of the computer.
LKS3LseJUUY,512239,513925,Do we have to compete with it?
LKS3LseJUUY,514000,515245,"We do, unfortunately."
LKS3LseJUUY,515320,519685,"So, it's by retouching and body imperfections and…"
LKS3LseJUUY,519760,520760,Where?
LKS3LseJUUY,522162,523302,Where darling?
LKS3LseJUUY,523377,525485,In general. Look here.
LKS3LseJUUY,525560,527572,We live in a world which is backlit.
LKS3LseJUUY,527647,531845,It's this experimentation with this idea of clothing being backlit.
LKS3LseJUUY,531920,533475,That light comes from within.
LKS3LseJUUY,533550,534964,"Very smart, by the way."
LKS3LseJUUY,535040,536805,I love the way this looked on the runway.
LKS3LseJUUY,536880,538551,"The sand way, the beach way."
LKS3LseJUUY,538626,544000,I was into this idea that sand is nearly like the end process of life.
LKS3LseJUUY,544188,545949,- I stole some sand. - Great.
LKS3LseJUUY,546024,547378,I put it in the coat.
LKS3LseJUUY,547454,548675,"Taking it home, darling."
LKS3LseJUUY,548751,552685,The more I kind of look into the normal world in the way
LKS3LseJUUY,552760,554848,in which we now retouch ourselves
LKS3LseJUUY,554923,558759,"or we face filters or we improve our bodies,"
LKS3LseJUUY,558836,561261,and this idea that everything has become hyper perfect
LKS3LseJUUY,561336,565337,"and I just thought, you know, like it was a kind of nod to this idea of"
LKS3LseJUUY,565412,567365,could clothing become backlit.
LKS3LseJUUY,567440,571245,I've been looking at different cars now that might change colour.
LKS3LseJUUY,571320,575525,And I was thinking does fashion need to start to kind of rebalance
LKS3LseJUUY,575600,580079,the idea of sensationalism within clothing?
LKS3LseJUUY,580320,582612,There's this odd debacle.
LKS3LseJUUY,582687,586445,It's like when you see someone online and then you meet them in reality
LKS3LseJUUY,586520,588525,and they're different people.
LKS3LseJUUY,588600,590264,I find it really inspiring.
LKS3LseJUUY,590339,592605,I don't know because I think it's kind of twisted.
LKS3LseJUUY,592680,594271,"Everyone hates mirrors,"
LKS3LseJUUY,594346,598845,"but in a weird way, we have now all fallen into the mirror somehow,"
LKS3LseJUUY,598920,600920,which becomes quite distorted.
LKS3LseJUUY,605968,608285,The selfie obsession on the garments.
LKS3LseJUUY,608360,611944,The photography of your body is printed on your clothes.
LKS3LseJUUY,612040,615324,I really like my facial expressions that are printed on the shirt.
LKS3LseJUUY,615400,617290,- Is it really your face? - It's my face.
LKS3LseJUUY,617365,619005,It's my face screaming.
LKS3LseJUUY,619080,620925,"It's nice. It's something different, right?"
LKS3LseJUUY,621000,623335,- Is it your first fashion show? - It's my first fashion show.
LKS3LseJUUY,623410,626079,My first fashion week. I love it.
LKS3LseJUUY,634815,637600,New shapes. Zig zags.
LKS3LseJUUY,639282,640962,Jellyfish cropped tops.
LKS3LseJUUY,646688,647888,Oyster prints.
LKS3LseJUUY,651116,652236,Casual denim.
LKS3LseJUUY,657271,658951,Heart-shaped marinière.
LKS3LseJUUY,662738,663858,Bags as shoes!
LKS3LseJUUY,668998,670678,Belts with messages.
LKS3LseJUUY,672358,674500,I kind of love it. It's my vibe.
LKS3LseJUUY,674575,676975,"A little bit oversized, comfortable."
LKS3LseJUUY,677075,678755,A Little bit flashy too.
LKS3LseJUUY,679621,681204,How shocked were you of Loewe?
LKS3LseJUUY,681280,682645,- How shocked? - Shocked.
LKS3LseJUUY,682720,685100,"Well actually not too shocked. I knew it was going to be beautiful,"
LKS3LseJUUY,685175,686218,but I didn't know what to expect.
LKS3LseJUUY,686293,689069,"Like the clothes, he always has so much fun with his clothes."
LKS3LseJUUY,689144,691357,- I agree. - And that was really fun.
LKS3LseJUUY,691432,693805,- Favourite piece? - The Hello belts.
LKS3LseJUUY,693880,696043,- That was sexy. - Very sexy.
LKS3LseJUUY,696118,699018,I loved the size. The scale was phenomenal.
LKS3LseJUUY,704407,706204,You're still watching Miss fashion.
LKS3LseJUUY,706280,708485,"It's not fashion, it's Miss Fashion."
LKS3LseJUUY,708560,710760,"And it's not pain, it's truly pleasure."
LKS3LseJUUY,718077,720666,Drains on trenches. I wonder what they mean.
LKS3LseJUUY,720741,723375,"I think it's the want of flushing everything away,"
LKS3LseJUUY,723450,725650,"out with the old, in with Loewe."
LKS3LseJUUY,727911,729511,"Drains on the bags,"
LKS3LseJUUY,730720,732715,drains on T-shirts.
LKS3LseJUUY,732791,735591,It's a mysterious symbol that is a drain.
LKS3LseJUUY,735815,738962,"The drains. For me, it was this idea of a mundane act."
LKS3LseJUUY,739038,743165,Everyone in the morning brushes their teeth and they look down.
LKS3LseJUUY,743240,745416,- Into that hole. - …And they spit into a drain.
LKS3LseJUUY,745491,749925,"And I just thought, it's this idea of like, where does that go?"
LKS3LseJUUY,750000,753436,This idea of the process of getting up.
LKS3LseJUUY,753511,756079,"And I just thought, could it be the new eyelids?"
LKS3LseJUUY,762758,766485,"A coat made of a scarf. Quirky, but regal."
LKS3LseJUUY,766560,770925,"I just like this idea that they were like, looks like total looks."
LKS3LseJUUY,771000,774165,"You know, this idea of, like, printing the body onto the body,"
LKS3LseJUUY,774240,776084,things that look normal or not normal.
LKS3LseJUUY,776160,778805,"The idea of having, like, oysters or cherries."
LKS3LseJUUY,778880,783085,This idea of singular foods that can sometimes be sexual can not sometimes not be sexual.
LKS3LseJUUY,783160,786204,"In a weird way, it's like slightly sexually perverse,"
LKS3LseJUUY,786280,788285,but at the same time incredibly normal.
LKS3LseJUUY,788360,790964,So we do love fashion to shock us. But why?
LKS3LseJUUY,791040,793685,"Well, I mean, fashion is a representation of our identity."
LKS3LseJUUY,793760,796082,"And we love to shock people because, you know,"
LKS3LseJUUY,796157,799420,who wants to look the same? I like to be different.
LKS3LseJUUY,799840,801245,- Every day? - Every day.
LKS3LseJUUY,801320,802775,- Every post? - Every post.
LKS3LseJUUY,802850,805519,"Every feed, post. Every video, every Tik Tok."
LKS3LseJUUY,806021,808404,Please note the see-through trench coats.
LKS3LseJUUY,808480,811944,"So we have transparent leather, which is like the early stages of when you tan leather."
LKS3LseJUUY,812019,814485,"So it's just when you stop it, midway."
LKS3LseJUUY,814560,816045,Which is very disturbing.
LKS3LseJUUY,816120,820660,But I kind of feel like in life we have to show these kinds of contradictions with things
LKS3LseJUUY,820735,822485,and realities as well.
LKS3LseJUUY,822560,825627,I do like when things feel a bit sick sometimes.
LKS3LseJUUY,825702,828525,It's hard to move in it.
LKS3LseJUUY,828600,831657,But it's the first time for me so I think it was great for a first time.
LKS3LseJUUY,831733,835165,"- First Loewe show? - Yes, I'm a junior in high school."
LKS3LseJUUY,835240,837251,"I was supposed to have class this morning, but here I am!"
LKS3LseJUUY,837326,840045,You're supposed to be in school?!
LKS3LseJUUY,840120,844205,"Darling, fashion calls and education has to wait."
LKS3LseJUUY,844280,846546,But you need to stay in school.
LKS3LseJUUY,846621,849004,Stay in school. Education is essential.
LKS3LseJUUY,849080,850138,He's 16.
LKS3LseJUUY,850213,852285,I'm old enough to be your grandmother.
LKS3LseJUUY,852360,854035,LOIC: He's 50 years younger than you!
LKS3LseJUUY,854110,856885,"Don't listen to them. They're mean, old men."
LKS3LseJUUY,856960,859605,"Grumpy, mean Loic Prigent."
LKS3LseJUUY,859680,861281,How did you feel today in the collection?
LKS3LseJUUY,861356,864196,I was kind of stressed at first.
LKS3LseJUUY,864271,866285,Because there are so many people here.
LKS3LseJUUY,866360,870084,I understand there's always a bit of stress before you enter a room full of people.
LKS3LseJUUY,870160,873764,Because we wait like 30 minutes before it.
LKS3LseJUUY,873840,876005,It was very stressful.
LKS3LseJUUY,876080,878347,We just have to do it and kill it.
LKS3LseJUUY,878680,882005,What is the worst thing that's happened backstage
LKS3LseJUUY,882080,884325,or on the runway for you?
LKS3LseJUUY,884400,890476,I was training first and I just did a quick turn and I hit a bench.
LKS3LseJUUY,890551,891840,You kicked someone?
LKS3LseJUUY,892308,895000,"That wasn't a bench, darling, that was a person. That was my leg."
LKS3LseJUUY,895286,896966,I still have a bruise.
LKS3LseJUUY,902278,908005,A cute kitten. One of those Internet images we only see backlit on a computer screen
LKS3LseJUUY,908080,910205,and never in the real print.
LKS3LseJUUY,910280,914248,"Or is it about being irresistible, viral but with a garment?"
LKS3LseJUUY,915810,917827,- How shocked are you? - It was amazing.
LKS3LseJUUY,917902,919420,- Wasn't it? - Crazy.
LKS3LseJUUY,919496,921537,I think my favourite Jonathan collection at Loewe.
LKS3LseJUUY,921613,924013,- Favourite piece? - Favourite piece?
LKS3LseJUUY,924088,925708,Jacket with denim shorts.
LKS3LseJUUY,925783,927630,- I like the bodysuit. - Same.
LKS3LseJUUY,927705,929805,The transparent bodysuit I think was so cool.
LKS3LseJUUY,929880,932371,- So sexy. - The whole show was sexy.
LKS3LseJUUY,932446,933963,"God, I want to be that thin."
LKS3LseJUUY,934038,935904,"To be that thin, that young."
LKS3LseJUUY,938319,940444,"The conch bag, the shell."
LKS3LseJUUY,940520,945725,I think it's a very innovative way to bring nature into something future.
LKS3LseJUUY,945800,947080,Nature. Future.
LKS3LseJUUY,947381,948661,Nature. Future.
LKS3LseJUUY,949185,953537,The bags of the collection this season were definitely about humour.
LKS3LseJUUY,953746,957795,It was looking at this idea of a hermit crab
LKS3LseJUUY,957871,960868,where you have a shell and then suddenly it will maybe take over a can
LKS3LseJUUY,960945,961966,or take over something else.
LKS3LseJUUY,962041,965205,So the idea that the flamenco bag started to grow out of the shell
LKS3LseJUUY,965280,968845,or we had this sinkhole became the eyelet.
LKS3LseJUUY,968920,971820,We had light coming from inside of the bags.
LKS3LseJUUY,972211,976565,I just feel like at the moment it's just about experimentation to me.
LKS3LseJUUY,976640,979384,"I'm not taking yourself too seriously, you know?"
LKS3LseJUUY,979459,980930,I need to chill out a bit.
LKS3LseJUUY,991344,994425,"Twenty minutes ago, I felt everything was negative in a way,"
LKS3LseJUUY,994501,996324,but now everything is positive.
LKS3LseJUUY,996400,997845,But the good positive.
LKS3LseJUUY,997920,1003084,The collection's about youth and freedom and the celebration of your own body.
LKS3LseJUUY,1003160,1006863,I love these catsuits where you can't miss any part of who you are.
LKS3LseJUUY,1006939,1010920,"And with all the play on light, anything with light. It really speaks to me."
LKS3LseJUUY,1023328,1025662,And Jonathan Anderson takes a bow.
LKS3LseJUUY,1036774,1039307,This was Miss Fashion with Miss Fame.
LKS3LseJUUY,1039383,1042485,I'm Miss Fame. And thank you for watching Miss Fashion.
LKS3LseJUUY,1042560,1046382,Don't forget to subscribe to Miss Fame on all her platforms.
LKS3LseJUUY,1046458,1047964,She's everywhere.
LKS3LseJUUY,1048040,1049995,Please do leave a Miss Fashion comment.
LKS3LseJUUY,1050070,1052644,"Yes. Binge on all my other fashion videos,"
LKS3LseJUUY,1052720,1056325,including the first episode of Miss Fashion with Miss Fame.
LKS3LseJUUY,1056400,1058920,Don't miss the next episode of Miss Fashion.
LKS3LseJUUY,1062800,1064805,They kind of need to meet.
LKS3LseJUUY,1064880,1066396,Have you met your doppelganger?
LKS3LseJUUY,1066471,1068605,- He is my twin brother. - Are you kidding?
LKS3LseJUUY,1068680,1071090,"No, he is really my twin. So many twins today."
LKS3LseJUUY,1071165,1072845,You guys know each other?
LKS3LseJUUY,1072920,1076285,Wait a minute. Am I getting a double entendre?
LKS3LseJUUY,1076360,1078205,Is this for real?
LKS3LseJUUY,1078280,1081765,I got to get in a Miss Fame sandwich.
LKS3LseJUUY,1081840,1083125,And I'm the cream.
LKS3LseJUUY,1083200,1084880,I'm the monster in the middle.
