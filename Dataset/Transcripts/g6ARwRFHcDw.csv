g6ARwRFHcDw,87600,91619,a strong independent Ukraine is vital
g6ARwRFHcDw,91619,94320,for the stability of the Euro Atlantic
g6ARwRFHcDw,94320,96560,area
g6ARwRFHcDw,96600,100680,today at the summit NATO lead is decided
g6ARwRFHcDw,100680,104759,a fundamental shift in our defense and
g6ARwRFHcDw,104759,108000,deterrence to respond to a new security
g6ARwRFHcDw,108000,110159,reality
g6ARwRFHcDw,110159,114720,we will strengthen our forward defenses
g6ARwRFHcDw,114720,117899,we will enhance our bad groups in the
g6ARwRFHcDw,117899,119820,eastern part of the alliance
g6ARwRFHcDw,119820,122579,opt to be grade levels
g6ARwRFHcDw,122579,125579,we will transform the NATO response
g6ARwRFHcDw,125579,128520,force and increase the number of high
g6ARwRFHcDw,128520,132660,redness forces to well over 300
g6ARwRFHcDw,132660,133980,000.
g6ARwRFHcDw,133980,137099,we will also boost our ability
g6ARwRFHcDw,137099,139319,to reinforce
g6ARwRFHcDw,139319,142379,including with more pre-positioned
g6ARwRFHcDw,142379,145379,equipment and stockpiles of military
g6ARwRFHcDw,145379,146760,supplies
g6ARwRFHcDw,146760,150300,more forward deployed capabilities like
g6ARwRFHcDw,150300,152040,air defense
g6ARwRFHcDw,152040,154860,strengthen command and control
g6ARwRFHcDw,154860,158900,and upgraded defense plans with forces
g6ARwRFHcDw,158900,164160,pre-assigned to defend specific allies
g6ARwRFHcDw,164160,166560,this is the first time since the cold
g6ARwRFHcDw,166560,170160,war that we have this kind of plans with
g6ARwRFHcDw,170160,173040,the pre-assigned forces
g6ARwRFHcDw,173040,176480,they will work with Home Defense Forces
g6ARwRFHcDw,176480,179840,and become familiar with local terrain
g6ARwRFHcDw,179840,183780,facilities and pre-positioned stocks
g6ARwRFHcDw,183780,188700,so that we can reinforce even faster
g6ARwRFHcDw,188700,192060,doing more will cost more
g6ARwRFHcDw,192060,193879,today allies
g6ARwRFHcDw,193879,196860,recommitted to the pledge we made in
g6ARwRFHcDw,196860,198300,2014.
g6ARwRFHcDw,198300,202080,to spend at least two percent of GDP on
g6ARwRFHcDw,202080,203580,the fence
g6ARwRFHcDw,203580,207080,since 2014 European allies and Canada
g6ARwRFHcDw,207080,211680,have spent the next round 350 billion US
g6ARwRFHcDw,211680,213060,dollars
g6ARwRFHcDw,213060,215099,nine allies
g6ARwRFHcDw,215099,218459,now reach or exceed the two percent
g6ARwRFHcDw,218459,222659,targets 19 allies have clear plans to
g6ARwRFHcDw,222659,225659,reach it by 2024.
g6ARwRFHcDw,225659,228000,and an additional five have concrete
g6ARwRFHcDw,228000,231959,commitments to meet it thereafter
g6ARwRFHcDw,231959,235680,two percent is increasingly seen as the
g6ARwRFHcDw,235680,238980,floor not as a ceiling
g6ARwRFHcDw,238980,241560,allies are also investing more in modern
g6ARwRFHcDw,241560,243560,capabilities
g6ARwRFHcDw,243560,246299,contributing more to Nato deployments
g6ARwRFHcDw,246299,249420,and exercises and we have agreed to
g6ARwRFHcDw,249420,252420,increase NATO's common funding
g6ARwRFHcDw,252420,255840,to finance to finance the facilities we
g6ARwRFHcDw,255840,257880,need for reinforcement
g6ARwRFHcDw,257880,260400,as well as more training and more
g6ARwRFHcDw,260400,264060,exercises command and control and
g6ARwRFHcDw,264060,266940,engagement with partners
g6ARwRFHcDw,266940,269780,we Face a radical change
g6ARwRFHcDw,269780,273060,to our security environment
g6ARwRFHcDw,273060,275580,and strategic competition is rising
g6ARwRFHcDw,275580,277320,around the world
g6ARwRFHcDw,277320,280259,so today leaders have endorsed NATO's
g6ARwRFHcDw,280259,282720,new strategic concept
g6ARwRFHcDw,282720,287460,and it is published as we speak and this
g6ARwRFHcDw,287460,290520,is the new strategic concept the current
g6ARwRFHcDw,290520,293340,one was agreed in 2010 and this is very
g6ARwRFHcDw,293340,295320,different compared to what we agreed
g6ARwRFHcDw,295320,297180,back then
g6ARwRFHcDw,297180,299940,it makes clear that Russia's Russia
g6ARwRFHcDw,299940,303479,poses the most significant and direct
g6ARwRFHcDw,303479,305400,threat to our security
g6ARwRFHcDw,305400,307440,in the current concept we state that
g6ARwRFHcDw,307440,310520,Russia is a strategic partner
g6ARwRFHcDw,310520,313979,in the current concept we do not mention
g6ARwRFHcDw,313979,318000,China with a single word in this allies
g6ARwRFHcDw,318000,321139,states that China's currency policies
g6ARwRFHcDw,321139,325020,challenge our interests security and
g6ARwRFHcDw,325020,327560,values
