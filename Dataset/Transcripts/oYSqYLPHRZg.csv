oYSqYLPHRZg,472115,475147,the beginnings of Feijoada stem from slavery.
oYSqYLPHRZg,475147,477065,"- Wow, then this is the national dish?"
oYSqYLPHRZg,477065,479580,- (PvF) Where slaves put together scraps of leftover beans and meat
oYSqYLPHRZg,479580,482214,from their owners to create a stew.
oYSqYLPHRZg,482214,483581,"- Wow. - I hate to say it,"
oYSqYLPHRZg,483581,485604,"but I swear to God, some of the best foods"

oYSqYLPHRZg,498616,500554,(man speaks in Portuguese)
oYSqYLPHRZg,500554,502399,- Is this more cheese? - Ooh!
oYSqYLPHRZg,502399,503616,- Is this more cheese?
oYSqYLPHRZg,503616,504774,- Is that cheese? It's a banana.
oYSqYLPHRZg,504774,506650,"- Wait, no, that looks like plantains."

oYSqYLPHRZg,507750,509250,"- Cheese? Cheese, cheese, cheese!"
oYSqYLPHRZg,509250,510500,- Cheese.
oYSqYLPHRZg,510500,512732,- This looks sweet. I want it to be sweet.
oYSqYLPHRZg,512732,514766,"- Oh, and then they cut it in a bar, so it's like a..."
oYSqYLPHRZg,514767,516982,"- I got no clue what just happened, but I'm ready."
oYSqYLPHRZg,516982,518800,- Like a cheese French fry.
oYSqYLPHRZg,518800,521599,- Oh my God! They're like little French fries!

oYSqYLPHRZg,525233,526500,- (Izzy) Mandioca Frita.
oYSqYLPHRZg,526500,529684,"- (PvF) Are a fried cassava root made crispy on the outside,"
oYSqYLPHRZg,529684,531066,and soft on the inside.
oYSqYLPHRZg,531066,533527,"- I would compare it to the French fry,"
oYSqYLPHRZg,533528,535932,"as in like crispy on the outside, kinda fluffy on the inside,"
oYSqYLPHRZg,535932,537111,that little situation. - Yeah.
oYSqYLPHRZg,537111,539294,- It's slightly different. It's nuttier.
oYSqYLPHRZg,539294,541277,- It's just a thicker potato.
oYSqYLPHRZg,541277,542907,It's just kind of like a chewier potato.
oYSqYLPHRZg,542907,544110,- But I love potatoes!

oYSqYLPHRZg,550416,551601,"- A little bit, yeah."
oYSqYLPHRZg,551601,555107,"- Fiery hot take, I like this better than sweet potato fries."
oYSqYLPHRZg,555107,556746,"- It is good, it is good."
oYSqYLPHRZg,556746,558623,"- (PvF) Alright, you ready for dessert?"

oYSqYLPHRZg,586284,586993,- (Izzy) Brigadeiro.
oYSqYLPHRZg,586993,588419,- (PvF) A traditional  Brazilian truffle
oYSqYLPHRZg,588419,590577,"consisting of condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter,"
oYSqYLPHRZg,590577,591623,and chocolate sprinkles.
oYSqYLPHRZg,591623,593643,"- Prize, ooh, it's smooshy!"
oYSqYLPHRZg,593643,595991,"- Mmm, mmm!"

oYSqYLPHRZg,609201,610993,"- Are you happy about it, or unhappy?"
oYSqYLPHRZg,610993,612928,"I can't tell by your face. - (laughs) No, I'm..."
oYSqYLPHRZg,612928,615237,- Mm-hmm! - That's an explosion of chocolate.
oYSqYLPHRZg,615237,616076,- Yeah.
oYSqYLPHRZg,616076,617443,- I'm gonna just out myself and be gross.
oYSqYLPHRZg,617443,619627,"But sometimes I'll just eat chocolate frosting with a spoon,"
oYSqYLPHRZg,619627,624379,"and like, this is like a non-disgusting way to do that."
oYSqYLPHRZg,624379,626575,- It's also really simple.
oYSqYLPHRZg,626575,627845,"- Of all of the things that we've had,"
oYSqYLPHRZg,627845,629459,that was the most intense.
oYSqYLPHRZg,629459,631894,"- Yeah, this is the strongest flavor. - Yeah."
oYSqYLPHRZg,631895,634563,- Kind of like the texture of a Tootsie Roll
oYSqYLPHRZg,634563,636672,you left in your shorts.
