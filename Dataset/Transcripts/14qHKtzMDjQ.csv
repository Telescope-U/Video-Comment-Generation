14qHKtzMDjQ,266560,272400,but you know what i've loved uh and  through the years and talking to you  guys and seeing you uh  i guess really in many ways coming to
14qHKtzMDjQ,272400,278880,your own as artists and and having such  a powerful voice um especially as i have  seen your voice as a powerful female
14qHKtzMDjQ,278880,285520,country music artist you're outspoken  about a lot of things what's your main  message right now that you love at your  concerts and as you make public
14qHKtzMDjQ,285520,290800,appearances that you really want to get  out there  oh wow i know it's loaded i don't know i
14qHKtzMDjQ,290800,295919,think that we're just trying to make it  more inclusive in every shape and form
14qHKtzMDjQ,295919,302560,and you know with these nominations of  the grammys mickey guyton is up uh for a  country album so it's like it's moving
14qHKtzMDjQ,302560,310080,in the right direction for sure so i  just you know i just want to be a good  friend and advocate and you know country
14qHKtzMDjQ,310080,316000,music is not a quiet genre like loretta  lynn put the pill out in the 70s and was
14qHKtzMDjQ,316000,322560,blacklisted from radio it's like women  in country have always been loud and  like saying what they stand up for but
14qHKtzMDjQ,322560,329120,um no i'm glad that it's like getting  the the praise it deserves so we've been  doing a little history being jeremy and

14qHKtzMDjQ,342560,347680,like when the cd would scratch and that  was basically it  that was always just such a bummer and
14qHKtzMDjQ,347680,353840,if it would like skip in your car  because you hit a speed bump or  something that's or you know you pull  out your big ugly giant cd booklet in

14qHKtzMDjQ,507840,513279,we do i got to tell you we've talked to  several people and many people have  mentioned you guys in terms of the
14qHKtzMDjQ,513279,520320,representation of country music um what  you you being public about who you are  has meant to the community and so much
14qHKtzMDjQ,520320,527920,support coming from country what has  that meant to you and and have you been  i don't know what's your take on here we  are at what yeah sometime later and
14qHKtzMDjQ,527920,533920,maryland  mayor morris was just singing your  praises  yeah amazing you know i mean i think the
14qHKtzMDjQ,533920,541600,thing is for me i hope i really hope  it's it's a  the question what does it mean for other  people who are like me that are still
14qHKtzMDjQ,541600,548000,kind of thinking questioning whether  they kind of kind of want to come out or  how they're going to be accepted  and i think for me i didn't know how i
14qHKtzMDjQ,548000,553360,was gonna be accepted i was so scared to  do it  and when i finally did and now being
14qHKtzMDjQ,553360,559600,able to live my life i i'm just so much  more happy and so much more  just at ease with so many things in my
14qHKtzMDjQ,559600,566480,life and it's it's so much better than i  ever thought it would be and so to be  here tonight and and to be accepted by
14qHKtzMDjQ,566480,572399,our genre the all of our friends and and  stuff of country music but then to come  here and have having just won a grammy

14qHKtzMDjQ,912240,919600,don't yeah it's locked i should know the  dance but it became a viral sensation  thanks to a popular tick-tock dance and  landed country singer walker hayes his
14qHKtzMDjQ,919600,925920,first grammy nomination for best country  song kind of a big deal he told us what  it has been like to see this track take
14qHKtzMDjQ,925920,932560,off  it's been a nice it's been a nice  realization that um
14qHKtzMDjQ,932560,937839,i don't do this for  the finish lines you know or the the
14qHKtzMDjQ,937839,943199,trophies or the money  or they're definitely not the fame
14qHKtzMDjQ,943199,949120,it's been a nice reminder that that it  is the creative process it is my peers
14qHKtzMDjQ,949120,955120,that um  my life has collided with to make this  stuff you know um
14qHKtzMDjQ,955120,960480,it's ridiculous how much i've been  reminded  you know i thought i loved music and i
14qHKtzMDjQ,960480,966880,thought i was in in awe of its power  but as as i watched the lives it touched
14qHKtzMDjQ,966880,972720,a song can touch and a silly song at  that  um and a dance
14qHKtzMDjQ,972720,978720,um i am i'm even more blown away by  god's gift of music
14qHKtzMDjQ,978720,984320,and um creativity just how nothing can  exist and then something can
14qHKtzMDjQ,984320,990480,and it can be nominated for grammy  here we are great grand master
14qHKtzMDjQ,990480,996560,fresh in from new york loving this vegas  heat weather it's incredible it's kind  of cold back in new york it is you know

14qHKtzMDjQ,1001920,1007040,co-building a culture that's arguably  the biggest music in the world  my next

14qHKtzMDjQ,1907519,1913039,talking a lot about john bautis and just  like the incredible art that he's  bringing to the 411 11 nominations most
14qHKtzMDjQ,1913039,1920559,nominated artists tonight  and when as you're mentioning some of  those people he came to mind for me  because of the depth of his uh artistry
14qHKtzMDjQ,1920559,1926000,and his and all of it he kind of fits in  that absolutely and i i should have  mentioned his name and you know today i
14qHKtzMDjQ,1926000,1932000,just watched that video for freedom  again where he's dancing i was getting  ready to go and he's just a spirit a
14qHKtzMDjQ,1932000,1939039,beacon of light yeah i mean such  incredible virtuosity but so much soul  and spirit he's like like mavis staples
14qHKtzMDjQ,1939039,1944799,somebody that's like a minister to the  rest of us that are feeling down in the  dumps oh well well it's not about art or
14qHKtzMDjQ,1944799,1950240,talent but i have to tell you i love  your hair always haven't still have my  mom

14qHKtzMDjQ,1978159,1983840,all right so uh look a pleasure to talk  to her and so many people as we said  this carpet is buzzing with people
14qHKtzMDjQ,1983840,1989760,it's a real event the grammys are back  here in vegas and i gotta talk about  this one area bay area rapper sweetie
14qHKtzMDjQ,1989760,1996000,i'm from the bay you guys know that have  had a breakthrough year earning two  grammy nods for a best rap song and best
14qHKtzMDjQ,1996000,2002799,new artist with a series of hit tracks  and collabs now under her belt so she  opened up about the advice she'd give
14qHKtzMDjQ,2002799,2010320,her younger self take a look  i would say you know take your time and  don't jump at the first opportunity
14qHKtzMDjQ,2010320,2015600,i felt like  those tough lessons definitely made me a  wiser woman but

14qHKtzMDjQ,2086960,2093040,experience like now i'm just literally  throwing away money losing yeah that's  how it felt for me to do a little slot  machine or something i did do this a lot

14qHKtzMDjQ,2112320,2118320,my greatest accomplishment so yeah i  just wanted what's the funniest thing  he's done lately because they get so
14qHKtzMDjQ,2118320,2125280,silly around that age when they're  figuring out their language and they're  walking and they're trying it wasn't  something necessarily funny but he like
14qHKtzMDjQ,2125280,2130800,knows how to get my attention so he'll  walk up to his baby gate and he'll throw  a toy over
14qHKtzMDjQ,2130800,2136320,and that's one way of like letting me  know like paying attention it's really  sweet like i find it really sweet but

14qHKtzMDjQ,2168560,2176079,period like you know there's tj osborne  from brothers osborne who came out this  year or last year and it's that's what
14qHKtzMDjQ,2176079,2181520,it's all about is like we're american  we're made up of so many nationalities
14qHKtzMDjQ,2181520,2189359,and creeds and  preferences whatever we are all here and  we belong together well well we're

14qHKtzMDjQ,2656880,2662400,real it's they love each other  when you watch them and in their videos  and to get
14qHKtzMDjQ,2662400,2667760,it's real and she is so down to earth  and he's down to earth and it's all  about the music and it's all about the
14qHKtzMDjQ,2667760,2672800,message of love and this album they  decided when they finished the first one
14qHKtzMDjQ,2672800,2679200,cheek to cheek that we're going to make  it all a cold porter record and it every  song is going to be a different a
14qHKtzMDjQ,2679200,2685200,different theme on love  so this is who they are and there's  something about tony bennett's music and

14qHKtzMDjQ,2754240,2759359,at an emmy's after party once and it was  one of those rooms where everyone's you  know going around talking and doing it
14qHKtzMDjQ,2759359,2765599,and then he takes the stage you could  have heard a pin drop  the man knows how to captivate an  audience and communicate in such a way
14qHKtzMDjQ,2765599,2771839,and that style is just him isn't it and  you got the snap too you know what it is
14qHKtzMDjQ,2771839,2777520,oh my god and this is what i love about  the grammys is that we are  honoring tony bennett we have just

14qHKtzMDjQ,2835599,2841280,never seen before i know so we're  looking forward to that i do feel like  jeremy that people are just uh talent is
14qHKtzMDjQ,2841280,2846960,pulling out the stops for this show  because i mean  they've had about two
14qHKtzMDjQ,2846960,2854160,three years to work out the best grammys  performance they could possibly want  because this is really the one where i
14qHKtzMDjQ,2854160,2861119,mean they're they're putting it into the  production like we're going to see  everyone bringing it one thing that i  think we're we have yet to mention is uh
14qHKtzMDjQ,2861119,2866720,the great trevor noah yeah he's coming  back hosting again um  and uh it's gonna be interesting to see
14qHKtzMDjQ,2866720,2873119,what he brings to it look especially  we're one week it's only been a week  since the slap around the world seeing  around the world smith at the oscars it
14qHKtzMDjQ,2873119,2878559,feels like it's been a thousand years it  does not feel like a week ago right this  is the first big award show since then
14qHKtzMDjQ,2878559,2884640,we will see what you know trevor noah  funny guy we'll see what kinds of things  he wants comedy is a big discussion
14qHKtzMDjQ,2884640,2890880,right now and comedic license and all of  that so who knows what that opening  monologue opening speech opening bit is
14qHKtzMDjQ,2890880,2897040,going to be but he is so smart as well  so whatever it is it's going to be right  on point we're talking earlier to
14qHKtzMDjQ,2897040,2902559,chelsea handler who made her way down  she's nominated tonight uh we were  asking her about that is it's a topic  that's still kind of floating around
14qHKtzMDjQ,2902559,2908319,especially in the comedy community  everything that happened with chris  rockefeller smith yeah and she had some  interesting comments about um just
14qHKtzMDjQ,2908319,2913680,understanding that chris is a brilliant  uh artist the brilliant comedian handled  things really well according to her she
14qHKtzMDjQ,2913680,2919680,kept it she was awesome and she was and  she was very just  just allotting him for everything that
14qHKtzMDjQ,2919680,2926319,had to do with this  it's one of those things where no one  expected that to happen at the oscars  but every award show wants to have their
14qHKtzMDjQ,2926319,2933040,viral moment every award show wants to  have sex maybe not that one but they  want to have something that gets people  talking so we'll see you know what
14qHKtzMDjQ,2933040,2938079,happens tonight in terms of performances  which are going to be incredible the  celebration of music celebration of so
14qHKtzMDjQ,2938079,2944480,many artists collaborations and things  on stage that we've never seen before  and then the comedy bits and other  things that make their way plus i will

14qHKtzMDjQ,3358640,3364640,uh chloe and hallie amazing and all they  do amazing to see their careers continue  as we saw her performing the other night
14qHKtzMDjQ,3364640,3369760,at music cares we both had that moment  of like wow like i mean seeing artists  from an early age and then really come
14qHKtzMDjQ,3369760,3377160,into their own in their own way but it  only makes sense though to have beyonce  yes
14qHKtzMDjQ,3382000,3387040,that's for sure um and so when it comes  to the different categories and things  that we could see happen some things
14qHKtzMDjQ,3387040,3392240,that happened that were a bit historic  when i think back about the 2020 grammys  back in the last normal one that i can
14qHKtzMDjQ,3392240,3399119,recall billy eilish swept all four major  categories and i remember her walking up  talking to her before the show you and i
14qHKtzMDjQ,3399119,3405280,and it was like excited to be there the  whole thing and then that night was her  night it was tonight olivia rodriguez
14qHKtzMDjQ,3405280,3411119,rodriguez people are saying could have  that exact kind of night sweeping those  big four categories uh i loved hearing
14qHKtzMDjQ,3411119,3417920,from her you can tell that she's like  soaking in the moment yeah um and if she  does it she'll only be the third person  ever to have had that kind of night of a
14qHKtzMDjQ,3417920,3424400,clean sweep of all four yeah we'll see  him i believe lauren hill did that once  uh she had like five like just it was
14qHKtzMDjQ,3424400,3429599,just her it was one of those nights  where everyone was like you it is yours  it is your night for sure it would be
14qHKtzMDjQ,3429599,3435760,really interesting though we saw phineas  arriving a little earlier billy eilish  hopefully will be making our way down  the carpet as well but here they are
14qHKtzMDjQ,3435760,3441440,just one week after being on that oscar  stage accepting oscars gold wait no what
14qHKtzMDjQ,3441440,3446480,what yeah  that was a week ago just one week ago  um that big what happened yeah nothing
14qHKtzMDjQ,3446480,3451680,happened but you know having that big  moment with it with oscar's gold and now  to be here with the opportunity for more
14qHKtzMDjQ,3451680,3459359,grammy's love it's just it's incredible  is billy eilish going to be an ego  like she's so young and to have just the
14qHKtzMDjQ,3459359,3464799,i think the hardest awards to come up in  in that egot line up sure you already
14qHKtzMDjQ,3464799,3470960,have the oscar you already have the  grammys i don't know if she's a you know  broadway girl but i'm just saying she  could do it she could do it
14qHKtzMDjQ,3470960,3476480,let's work it out you know who else  we're excited for john batiste yeah john  bates we haven't even talked about him
14qHKtzMDjQ,3476480,3483040,much tonight nominations 11 nominations  the most of the night and just a lovable  guy too like that's the thing like when
14qHKtzMDjQ,3483040,3488079,you were just so real and just sweet and  he's also  just so open about everything he's going
14qHKtzMDjQ,3488079,3493760,through because this is telling jeremy  jeremy's telling earlier this has been  like a roller coaster for him well his  beautiful wife had been very open about
14qHKtzMDjQ,3493760,3499200,in fact this morning on cbs sunday  morning there was a beautiful package uh  talking about her second battle now with
14qHKtzMDjQ,3499200,3504880,leukemia  and and john batiste opening up about  how he's simultaneously having these
14qHKtzMDjQ,3504880,3509920,incredible career-defining moments like  tonight at the grammys while his wife is
14qHKtzMDjQ,3509920,3516160,also going through chemotherapy both of  them so supportive of each other and so  honest and raw about what they're going
14qHKtzMDjQ,3516160,3522319,through and learning to live in the  moment whether it's good or bad i hope  that we get to talk to him about that  because his way of articulating it is
14qHKtzMDjQ,3522319,3527359,beautiful the music that he that he's  creating through it is also beautiful  and it's truly what the celebration of
14qHKtzMDjQ,3527359,3533040,the grammys is about that kind of artist  if you're confused by us saying wife yes  this all happened you know while he was
14qHKtzMDjQ,3533040,3539599,getting this news he is married and you  know like he has had that support system  from colbert who is just like his
14qHKtzMDjQ,3539599,3547040,right-hand man of course but i can't  wait to see just how he's feeling  tonight because the most nominated
14qHKtzMDjQ,3547040,3553119,there's a spotlight on you so from the  second you get those nominations and by  the way let's just say this if he wins  any and even if he doesn't just from
14qHKtzMDjQ,3553119,3559839,being who he is i need a full-on music  special episode of colbert yeah turn the  show over let the man sing for an hour

14qHKtzMDjQ,3755839,3761039,said that new music's coming out what  kind of tone what's the vibe going to be  compared to maybe things we've heard  from you guys
14qHKtzMDjQ,3761039,3768839,it's like quincy jones said it's it's  pretty on the top and dirty on the  bottom
14qHKtzMDjQ,3778960,3784720,hello  so  i don't know if you've gotten this  before but i could talk to you for hours

14qHKtzMDjQ,3797039,3803839,in just the r b world and now the  crossing over everyone loved that song  i'm still in shock i think
14qHKtzMDjQ,3803839,3810799,a bit apathetic because i like i have a  delayed reaction  i'm still in the middle of it it's only  been three months yeah so that's really
14qHKtzMDjQ,3810799,3817920,crazy i think tick-tock  the internet social media  really is like when it's used correctly

14qHKtzMDjQ,3823760,3830160,incredible i wonder if there's a tipping  point for you there's you live with  something personally for a long time and  then finally people start hearing it and
14qHKtzMDjQ,3830160,3835839,then it catches was there a tipping  point where it was like oh now it's next  level and what was that yeah what was  that point
14qHKtzMDjQ,3835839,3842160,so there was a moment when i was home in  vero beach very small town  i was coming from chick-fil-a
14qHKtzMDjQ,3842160,3848319,and i heard the song playing i'm like  wait a second and it was the car next to  us oh

14qHKtzMDjQ,4126798,4132798,you're right you're right you're right  well i'm just so excited for this  performance i mean it is the song that
14qHKtzMDjQ,4132798,4139199,has just i mean it's put fruit on the  map  and  finally you know fruit is finally happy
14qHKtzMDjQ,4139199,4145278,it's just finally having a moment  teaching peaches with justin bieber it's  actually our first time ever performing
14qHKtzMDjQ,4145278,4150480,it together really wait really just  because everything  tour  it was just hard to get us out in the
14qHKtzMDjQ,4150480,4156080,same place at the same time oh my god  perfect wait how did rehearsals go  amazing it feels super good to be up
14qHKtzMDjQ,4156080,4162640,there it felt like the music video  because the video we were just hanging  out and it was just like just three  homies just just chilling really so it
14qHKtzMDjQ,4162640,4169920,felt the same way i was asking jeremy  just because you know grammys we're  talking about music old and new um have  you heard from 112 about people
14qHKtzMDjQ,4169920,4174960,taking peaches like  peaches and cream is the song that
14qHKtzMDjQ,4177440,4185120,how are you feeling  i'm very excited uh this is my first um  grammys since well i was never actually
14qHKtzMDjQ,4185120,4190798,invited so last time i had a ticket that  someone gave me and i was in a bleachers
14qHKtzMDjQ,4190798,4196960,i snuck into some grammys right but this  is the first time and it was a it was a  dark sad day because it was the day that
14qHKtzMDjQ,4196960,4202800,kobe pastor yeah right yeah yeah we were  there that day yes yeah it was at the  staples center so yeah it was just a
14qHKtzMDjQ,4202800,4208960,heavy day so this day feels a lot more  brighter but yeah  this uh song is like the song that just
14qHKtzMDjQ,4208960,4214560,never ends and keeps on giving to you  guys right i mean i feel like it's been  out for it's been locked in everyone's
14qHKtzMDjQ,4214560,4219920,consciousness for so long it's got to  feel special that it just keeps on  having these iterations of love
14qHKtzMDjQ,4219920,4226640,and love and love and bringing you guys  into these moments yeah i think that's  the goal that we i think we live in a  space of just like instant gratification
14qHKtzMDjQ,4226640,4232000,and just something's hearing something's  not so the idea that we could have a  chance to try to make something more
14qHKtzMDjQ,4232000,4238880,timeless than just here and then go on  is is  speaking of timeless heartbreaking  anniversary i mean
14qHKtzMDjQ,4238880,4245440,yet and still to this day and there's  been so much more since then and all of  it is good but that is a song that just
14qHKtzMDjQ,4245440,4250880,it takes people there everything every  single time so i i mean the goal  whenever i'm making something is
14qHKtzMDjQ,4250880,4258320,when you press play you're not sure  which decade is from  yeah  [Laughter]
14qHKtzMDjQ,4258320,4265600,yeah i'm trying to make sure like in 20  years when  kids are pressing play they'll be like  you know yeah i feel this i love that
14qHKtzMDjQ,4265600,4271360,real quick is there what's the after  party  party  i think i'm just going to dinner and
14qHKtzMDjQ,4271360,4276800,then i feel like with vegas they kind of  just wing it yeah there's so much you're  just like what do we feel like right
14qHKtzMDjQ,4276800,4284840,that's the problem with me  so it drives you crazy yeah so i i'm  like what what's going on everybody
14qHKtzMDjQ,4284840,4290800,yeah it's a pleasure to talk to you man  we appreciate you congrats it's gonna be  the place to be thank you so much have a
14qHKtzMDjQ,4290800,4297600,great one  we'll be looking for that performance  okay that performance is  a major nightmare just like that uh that
14qHKtzMDjQ,4297600,4303120,performance will definitely be one of  the nice oh yeah that one that people  will be talking about and i feel like i  haven't seen i mean pandemic but i
14qHKtzMDjQ,4303120,4308400,haven't seen justin bieber perform in a  while and so i'm so excited because i
14qHKtzMDjQ,4308400,4314159,mean he had he's had a couple albums  since everything kicked off but  they have been wonderful and i've been
14qHKtzMDjQ,4314159,4319600,listening to them and i'm excited to see  them back on the stage one of those  things is that when it comes up and we  realize oh wait a lot of these not only
14qHKtzMDjQ,4319600,4325679,have we all kind of had this feeling of  disconnect but a lot of these artists  have been making amazing music but  completely separate and now having the
14qHKtzMDjQ,4325679,4331840,opportunity to come together to be in  the same room and really give us all the  fans what we want we want to see them  performing together we want to see them
14qHKtzMDjQ,4331840,4337760,vibe off each other and have that  chemistry and someone had to tell me  this when i was on the podcast but they  were like we need to credit zoom for
14qHKtzMDjQ,4337760,4344960,like some of these songs because so many  artists have actually made music over  zoom like it's it's crazy
14qHKtzMDjQ,4344960,4350719,that this has happened but it's possible  i mean it is possible and look it's  we've had plenty of opportunities to get
14qHKtzMDjQ,4350719,4356880,into the personal sort of aspect of a  lot of these artists as they've done  live streams and different things like  that as we were talking to uh i think
14qHKtzMDjQ,4356880,4362560,kings of leon before our live show here  about just the reality of how great it
14qHKtzMDjQ,4362560,4368400,is to be back in front of an audience i  think uh the black pumas were talking  about yeah and like yeah the streaming
14qHKtzMDjQ,4368400,4373760,stuff was good for a bit we had a minute  it was it was okay but we need that we  need that audience human connection
14qHKtzMDjQ,4373760,4379040,right yeah and you can feel it on this  carpet and i'll be honest with you  sometimes grammys is difficult like
14qHKtzMDjQ,4379040,4385520,these artists are in their heads they're  ready to perform they're nervous and all  of that but we're just getting i mean  you guys see it we're getting very good
14qHKtzMDjQ,4385520,4391199,energy like they're just happy to be  here and out and healthy and and just  feeling blessed sure we're talking about
14qHKtzMDjQ,4391199,4396640,john bautista a little earlier we think  that he's going to be coming over here  in just a minute but he was one of the  presenters as well the other night at
14qHKtzMDjQ,4396640,4402239,the music cares mitchell tribute  and just was able to bring it him along
14qHKtzMDjQ,4402239,4408239,with so many other artists billy billy  porter people in tears philly everyone  in texas music cares i don't know where
14qHKtzMDjQ,4408239,4413920,you can find it but find it he  sang clouds and it just it
14qHKtzMDjQ,4413920,4420000,be still my heart be sell my heart for  sure billy porter who we saw arrive  earlier will definitely be on all the  fashion roundups tomorrow no doubt about
14qHKtzMDjQ,4420000,4426880,that him and so many others so as we  continue here counting down to music's  biggest night from vegas the grammy
14qHKtzMDjQ,4426880,4433840,awards what are you looking forward to  i'm looking forward to  mister hold on  40 hours mr john batiste
14qHKtzMDjQ,4433840,4438678,here he comes almost here he is
14qHKtzMDjQ,4445760,4452480,i'm blessed what can i say we won four  already yeah and i was just telling my  my folks you know my granddad is here
14qHKtzMDjQ,4452480,4457679,he's almost 90 years old you think about  what his life was and to be in this  moment he looked at me said this is once
14qHKtzMDjQ,4457679,4462719,in a lifetime and i'm just so happy i'm  just so proud of what the music has done
14qHKtzMDjQ,4462719,4468800,in this time people who were going  through dark things have reached out  sent mail all kind of stuff to tell us
14qHKtzMDjQ,4468800,4474880,this music really helped me in this time  john i got to tell you i saw on cbs  sunday morning just a beautiful story
14qHKtzMDjQ,4474880,4481280,about you your wife  all that you're going through and your  ability to articulate having some of the
14qHKtzMDjQ,4481280,4487360,most successful big career moments while  at the same time dealing with a lot of a
14qHKtzMDjQ,4487360,4493040,lot of heartache the roller coaster with  uh her leukemia battle uh and your  articulation of that is inspiring how do
14qHKtzMDjQ,4493040,4499600,you sum up the moment you're in  i think the moment is  always about being present
14qHKtzMDjQ,4499600,4505600,to sum up the moment is to be present  because the moment has so much in it  that is teaching us
14qHKtzMDjQ,4505600,4512159,we're also walking in our purpose  so we're doing things and we're learning  at the same time we're giving and we're
14qHKtzMDjQ,4512159,4518480,receiving it's that constant flow and  that's it i don't think we should  describe anything deeper than that to
14qHKtzMDjQ,4518480,4524159,the moment  that's all it is be present that's it  because if you're there then you can
14qHKtzMDjQ,4524159,4529440,appreciate the highs and you can also  see the lessons in the lows  and if they're happening at the same
14qHKtzMDjQ,4529440,4537120,time you can sustain and have a  fortitude in the chaos  you can sustain through it so i don't
14qHKtzMDjQ,4537120,4542800,i don't go into any deeper philosophy  than that just be present and be happy  that you're here well this is your
14qHKtzMDjQ,4542800,4548159,moment oh my god nominations and i'm  present baby
14qHKtzMDjQ,4548640,4554480,congrats on being married that secret  wedding and here we go wait do you have  the ring where are we going look this is

14qHKtzMDjQ,4578400,4583840,by him and hearing his heart you know  and what he's going through and his  ability to again i know i can say his
14qHKtzMDjQ,4583840,4590000,ability to articulate very genuinely and  to express it through his music uh and i  want to say it one more time i want to  john betsy's all music special on

14qHKtzMDjQ,4621040,4627360,come from  but all of a sudden the most rabid fans  that you have ever seen are rushed to
