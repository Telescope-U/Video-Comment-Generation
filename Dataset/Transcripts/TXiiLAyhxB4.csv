TXiiLAyhxB4,359520,364880,students really excited about the  conversation that we're about to have  but before we start our conversation i
TXiiLAyhxB4,364880,370800,would just like to know a little more  about yourselves if you can introduce  yourself who you are and where you're
TXiiLAyhxB4,370800,376800,from  okay my name is caroline bosov and i'm  bored and read here in port elizabeth
TXiiLAyhxB4,376800,382160,okay thanks caroline and you  i'm saying  i'm from copenhagen village it's in
TXiiLAyhxB4,382160,387199,amateur west district second year bed  student
TXiiLAyhxB4,387199,392240,foundation phase all right  so what attracted you to do foundation
TXiiLAyhxB4,392240,398800,phase  the reason why i i chose this phrase is  because  i guess it's because maybe i i love
TXiiLAyhxB4,398800,405360,children your reasons for foundation  phase well my journey started a long  time ago i have a disability called
TXiiLAyhxB4,405360,411680,dyslexia and then people look at me you  want to teach my child to read and write  if you can't read and write
TXiiLAyhxB4,411680,417199,so  i would say that my foundation phase  teachers were very important because
TXiiLAyhxB4,417199,422240,they did the foundation and they really  had to teach me different ways how to
TXiiLAyhxB4,422240,427440,cope with my disability and then i  started doing science expo and i was
TXiiLAyhxB4,427440,433840,like what am i going to do  and then i said hey but i want to be a  teacher let's see and
TXiiLAyhxB4,433840,440000,test the waters  and then i looked at all the phases and  the phase that really sticked to me was
TXiiLAyhxB4,440000,445360,foundation phase now let's come to your  other experience then
TXiiLAyhxB4,445360,451280,with the foundation phase itself  you're now in your second year
TXiiLAyhxB4,451280,457680,have you been to schools  and if so  how is that experience been yes you can
TXiiLAyhxB4,457680,463039,see  children on in the street  but in the classroom for the first time

TXiiLAyhxB4,468160,473919,and my eyes really opened and i saw that  there's really a need and the students
TXiiLAyhxB4,473919,479039,love you they come to you like teacher  come help me with this so what we learn
TXiiLAyhxB4,479039,484240,in the textbooks is yes we learn  but we don't learn and we don't see all
TXiiLAyhxB4,484240,490720,the factors that plays in in a child's  life you must always understand that
TXiiLAyhxB4,490720,497440,children they're not empty empty vessel  they come they have communities they  have families they have problems and you
TXiiLAyhxB4,497440,504160,as a teacher must very look at the child  and say okay  what is the influencing this child at
TXiiLAyhxB4,504160,511680,the moment you can't just say he's very  naughty he's not doing his homework if  you don't know what's going on at home
TXiiLAyhxB4,511680,518159,it is very nice for me the classroom i  enjoy it so much the children are so  loving they they always want your
TXiiLAyhxB4,518159,524000,attention  and i it makes me feel i feel good to  see them happy to say to see them

TXiiLAyhxB4,537200,542399,would even meet them at spa they would  leave their mothers there and then come  and greet me even if i don't see that
TXiiLAyhxB4,542399,547440,they come to me so they recognize they  know me  and i appreciate that so much i mean

TXiiLAyhxB4,642720,647839,up there mingle get to know each other  talk about stuff do group assignments
TXiiLAyhxB4,647839,653839,and so forth but um online class has  been okay it was a huge adjustment for
TXiiLAyhxB4,653839,659279,me seeing that i matriculated in 2020  and then now yeah i have to start with
TXiiLAyhxB4,659279,665279,online classes it was a big step up for  me all right and second year
TXiiLAyhxB4,665279,671279,how has your experience been now you're  doing your second year have you been to  school
TXiiLAyhxB4,671279,677680,i was fortunate that yes with the  school-based learning i've been to a  public school i'm at a private school
TXiiLAyhxB4,677680,684800,currently  in my heart at my core i think i'm  called to be in public schools
TXiiLAyhxB4,684800,690959,i was fortunate enough to study in  private schools all of my life and the  reason why i came to education and
TXiiLAyhxB4,690959,696320,studied education was because i wanted  to write all the wrongs that i saw in my
TXiiLAyhxB4,696320,703040,own society that i grew up in because  the children i grew up with did not have  the opportunities or were fortunate
TXiiLAyhxB4,703040,708240,enough to have parents that could have  food afford the opportunities that i had  so
TXiiLAyhxB4,708240,713519,seeing the challenges that they have the  challenges that the teachers have
TXiiLAyhxB4,713519,720720,my my heart is in public schools for  foundation phase all right  lauren you are so young
TXiiLAyhxB4,720720,726000,and your decision to become a foundation  phase teacher where does that come from
TXiiLAyhxB4,726000,732320,well i love children let's start there i  really love children and my reason being  why i want to study foundation phase
TXiiLAyhxB4,732320,738399,teaching is because i want to be part of  the group of people part of the system  that lays the foundation needed in the
TXiiLAyhxB4,738399,745360,young lives of our children to let them  realize their dreams and their strong  beliefs and prepare them for what lies
TXiiLAyhxB4,745360,751839,ahead  that's so wonderful to hear especially  for me as a dean i'm excited to hear
TXiiLAyhxB4,751839,759440,that and now um paul your  experience  um this year so last year you were still
TXiiLAyhxB4,759440,765360,it was covered online and this year  still online how are you finding that  experience
TXiiLAyhxB4,765360,770800,i think i'm at an i'm at an advantage  because i've experienced university
TXiiLAyhxB4,770800,776240,coming to class having  university parties and all of that  so
TXiiLAyhxB4,776240,784000,covid for me is a blessing  i get to spend more time with my  children i get to give of myself more to
TXiiLAyhxB4,784000,790639,other people i'm involved with the first  experience program with umamzo so  studying online for me i i'm not
TXiiLAyhxB4,790639,797120,complaining um as long as you can manage  your time that's that for me is the  biggest talking about mums but i want to
TXiiLAyhxB4,797120,802160,go to the first year now to hear about  the first year experience how have you
TXiiLAyhxB4,802160,808720,found that  everything like all they do for us it is  just so amazing they assist us with
TXiiLAyhxB4,808720,814000,whatever we need if it's what school  with modules whatever emotional support
TXiiLAyhxB4,814000,819519,whatever we need we can go to mumsa with  it and she's just the best oh wow
TXiiLAyhxB4,819519,825600,and you as a student assistant helping  moms or um  can you just you know
TXiiLAyhxB4,825600,832079,tell us about the experiences that  you've had highlights for example not  just positives but things that you can
TXiiLAyhxB4,832079,837600,highlight about the kind of difference  that the program  has to offer
TXiiLAyhxB4,837600,844959,the program  is set in such a way that it does not  necessarily compete or
TXiiLAyhxB4,844959,852800,belittle what happens in the lecture  room but as a component of support  we found that our core the the core of
TXiiLAyhxB4,852800,859680,the first year experience program is to  be able to  break down whatever is
TXiiLAyhxB4,859680,867279,taught in the lecture room in the mother  language of students which we found to  be the biggest biggest barrier to even
TXiiLAyhxB4,867279,872480,comprehending content  to even answering questions on an
TXiiLAyhxB4,872480,879920,assignment or a test paper  so highlights have been  being able to help a student say because
TXiiLAyhxB4,879920,887279,you explained it to me in is it closer i  now know what you're talking about  i can answer it i don't feel as though i
TXiiLAyhxB4,887279,892720,do not have the knowledge  to attack this if someone is watching  you
TXiiLAyhxB4,892720,897760,and  really would like to go to university or  further their studies wherever they want
TXiiLAyhxB4,897760,903600,to further their studies what message  would you give to them  you are valid
TXiiLAyhxB4,903600,912959,you are valid  knock on doors it doesn't matter how  many of those doors are closed continue
TXiiLAyhxB4,924959,932399,the country available find that to to  actually know that um there is such a  place as the nelson mandela university
TXiiLAyhxB4,932399,938639,and you know like okay well as someone  who's worked you know you you ask people  how is it there like do you enjoy it and
TXiiLAyhxB4,938639,945920,everyone has something positive to say  sometimes you're always skeptical that  why are you all this nice you know is it
TXiiLAyhxB4,945920,951199,really that nice  i can honestly say that everyone that  has said anything nice about this
TXiiLAyhxB4,951199,957519,university means it  it's not a matter of wanting to seem a  certain way or sound a certain way we
TXiiLAyhxB4,957519,964800,are being real with what is happening  lauren you a final word for someone  who's listening and watching your dreams
TXiiLAyhxB4,964800,971279,and your strong beliefs hold on to that  that is what will get you where you want  to be in life one day and if teaching is
TXiiLAyhxB4,971279,975759,where you want to be nmu is the place to  go
TXiiLAyhxB4,980079,986800,first let's start with you what's your  name and where are you from i am sam  calise with pepe i'm from pe i'm born

TXiiLAyhxB4,1078320,1084640,it's amazing so second and third year  you've been to schools yes how has that
TXiiLAyhxB4,1084640,1089679,experience been okay so um  we started with student-based learning

TXiiLAyhxB4,1095679,1101520,section of it was in even before school  started at nmu uh then we attended for
TXiiLAyhxB4,1101520,1107840,two full weeks consecutive 15  consecutive days um that was it was a  beautiful experience i'm not even going
TXiiLAyhxB4,1107840,1113039,to lie it's one thing to be in a  classroom i mean behind  um
TXiiLAyhxB4,1113039,1118799,a  a  pc  learning or hearing the lecturer but
TXiiLAyhxB4,1118799,1124480,then and them telling you what you will  obviously need to do but then when you  actually put it into action and you see
TXiiLAyhxB4,1124480,1130799,the kids and you  are there firsthand experience it's yeah  it's out of this world i enjoy it a lot

TXiiLAyhxB4,1147679,1152960,feel  like i can be myself  it's better than high school
TXiiLAyhxB4,1152960,1159679,and this faculty it just makes you feel  like this is the perfect choice for you
TXiiLAyhxB4,1159679,1166559,especially with mums  especially with mums or tell me a little  bit about mamzo and the kind of support
TXiiLAyhxB4,1166559,1171919,you know that she's giving to the first  years she's the mother away from home
TXiiLAyhxB4,1171919,1177360,she's just always there even if you need  any kind of advice and she's a support
TXiiLAyhxB4,1177360,1184720,structure like she relates with you  personally and she's  just amazing a mom
TXiiLAyhxB4,1184720,1191679,all right  let me just hear about the funding that  you've received are you self-funded are
TXiiLAyhxB4,1191679,1198320,you a fundamental student nsfast what  kind of financial support did you get  for you to be able to study
TXiiLAyhxB4,1198320,1205840,okay so um with me i was fortunate  enough to actually be  from the shocker a fundamental
TXiiLAyhxB4,1205840,1213039,so last year and this year as well i'm  very grateful for that because education  in general is very expensive
TXiiLAyhxB4,1213039,1219919,um yeah so that's my funding okay and  then with funza what kind of support do  you have in terms of finance what do
TXiiLAyhxB4,1219919,1226559,they pay for they pay for full academic  tuition they pay for housing we get an
TXiiLAyhxB4,1226559,1232320,allowance every month and we communicate  a lot with mrs hussman she's very she
TXiiLAyhxB4,1232320,1237360,and because when you're waiting for  funding especially with friends aloha it  comes in later in the year so there's so
TXiiLAyhxB4,1237360,1243120,many questions and you know things that  we need to find out about and she's  always willing to assist us with that
TXiiLAyhxB4,1243120,1250240,all right is there anything that you'd  like to advise and i want to go back to  you um from bisana you know
TXiiLAyhxB4,1250240,1256320,someone might be watching what is it  that you would say to that  learner who's in high school you know
TXiiLAyhxB4,1256320,1263760,planning to come to university  i do communicate with lena's in high  school even now
TXiiLAyhxB4,1263760,1269520,first of all  during the lockdown  we collected all as  a
TXiiLAyhxB4,1269520,1275360,student teachers we collected the  student  who was around our place
TXiiLAyhxB4,1275360,1280799,and pushing the curriculum while  the teachers were not able to
TXiiLAyhxB4,1280799,1285919,to to go face to face with teacher  learners and advising them to apply to
TXiiLAyhxB4,1285919,1292080,the university and also with the funding  because we don't feel good when we see
TXiiLAyhxB4,1292080,1298159,the person who's struggling with the  funding while the school is accepted  that particular department
TXiiLAyhxB4,1298159,1304720,so we advise them to apply and to choose  their choice that they will they are  comfortable too
TXiiLAyhxB4,1304720,1310000,but you also tell about education  and then give them the choice to show
TXiiLAyhxB4,1310000,1315440,whether education is good to them or not  [Music]  no thanks for that and francesca what
TXiiLAyhxB4,1315440,1323679,would you say to someone coming in you  know sitting at home wanting to come  into university it is the best option
TXiiLAyhxB4,1323679,1329120,that you can make it's not only for  personal development or educational
TXiiLAyhxB4,1329120,1336080,development it's the whole journey i'd  suggest that  you come to university you explore your
TXiiLAyhxB4,1336080,1341520,options you find out what do i want to  do what is my purpose and fall in love
TXiiLAyhxB4,1341520,1348240,with something  that's you  thank you and you your final word
TXiiLAyhxB4,1348240,1354960,of advice  um okay so i'm going to speak with  regards to education and i remember last
TXiiLAyhxB4,1354960,1361520,year we were taught that we need to be  agents of change so being an agent of  change isn't only within the the
TXiiLAyhxB4,1361520,1367679,limitations of you know the school you  are an agent of change in your community  you are an agent of change in your
TXiiLAyhxB4,1367679,1372960,workplace wherever you there are people  you can assist you know and with the
TXiiLAyhxB4,1372960,1381440,education department  some other way they  they teach us to be  people to have a bundle to to
TXiiLAyhxB4,1381440,1388880,be accommodating of others you know so  yeah  that's my final word  thank you so much for your time

TXiiLAyhxB4,1438480,1446000,name is isaji gizella i'm a third year  student in sp f interface i'm majoring  in languages as a course in english
TXiiLAyhxB4,1446000,1452400,i just want to understand how did you  learn  about nelson mandela university faculty
TXiiLAyhxB4,1452400,1459679,of education of course when you're about  to embark on the journey you have to do  a lot of searching on the internet
TXiiLAyhxB4,1459679,1464960,i think because i'm from a town close by  i already knew of nelson mandela  university
TXiiLAyhxB4,1464960,1471120,and i've also had family who've studied  here so yeah so  all right a new question
TXiiLAyhxB4,1471120,1476240,i guess i followed friends oh wow okay  but i've only had the good things of the
TXiiLAyhxB4,1476240,1481360,university regular visits from the  university to our school  we had a teacher that was involved in
TXiiLAyhxB4,1481360,1488880,athletics at the university so we  visited here most saturday mornings part  took in that event and then
TXiiLAyhxB4,1488880,1496000,it was natural gravitation to come here  i felt at home all right great i'm happy  i'm happy to hear that caesar back then
TXiiLAyhxB4,1496000,1502880,in high school dr we have you used to  have senior students that would visit in  our schools and then they would
TXiiLAyhxB4,1502880,1508799,tell us more about the university life  as you know that we have been in the  area so we haven't been exposed much in
TXiiLAyhxB4,1508799,1515600,university  so they have gave us more information  about the university of which i was very
TXiiLAyhxB4,1515600,1522240,interested to apply also then i followed  the rules oh wow great and now you say  as i know where you're from i want to
TXiiLAyhxB4,1522240,1528159,know where you are from tell others i am  from  my hometown is in congo all right um now
TXiiLAyhxB4,1528159,1533919,tell me how  what made you decide to become a teacher  because yes you can know that there's a
TXiiLAyhxB4,1533919,1539679,university  um there's a lot of qualifications that  you could have chosen but you've chosen
TXiiLAyhxB4,1539679,1544960,education and to become a teacher funny  enough my whole family is in education
TXiiLAyhxB4,1544960,1551360,my younger brother my mother and my late  father so naturally  i somehow ended up
TXiiLAyhxB4,1551360,1557039,here now doing education and it fits  like a glove don't tell my father i said  this
TXiiLAyhxB4,1557039,1562720,but my father's a teacher so and  gravitated towards teaching um but  i've just always
TXiiLAyhxB4,1562720,1568960,loved helping  and the natural progression was to  become a teacher you're changing lives
TXiiLAyhxB4,1568960,1577279,on the grassroots and it has an impact  for the rest of a student's life so  that's why teaching he chose me
TXiiLAyhxB4,1578320,1584159,um the reason why i chose uh education  just like ks said  is that i've been very passionate with
TXiiLAyhxB4,1584159,1589360,working with other people and um i made  sure that if i have met particular
TXiiLAyhxB4,1589360,1595039,person i make sure that i leave a mark  that i'd make a difference into their  lives and i remember this time back in
TXiiLAyhxB4,1595039,1600880,high school you used to have the small  groups whereby we used to discuss and  help one another and then i would be the
TXiiLAyhxB4,1600880,1607120,one that would be keen to to to help  other students to  to discuss other topics whenever like
TXiiLAyhxB4,1607120,1612799,sort of extra classes and then the more  i did this i'd realized that no this is
TXiiLAyhxB4,1612799,1619360,what i actually want to do and i'm  enjoying that everyone would come and  ask like questions after and then it
TXiiLAyhxB4,1619360,1627039,would be clear and then like no  i'm getting teaching wow that's  wonderful and now that you are in the
TXiiLAyhxB4,1627039,1633200,faculty and i'm glad that you are senior  students so at least you've got some  experience about you know the programs
TXiiLAyhxB4,1633200,1638640,that we are offering  what would you say  has been your experience you know with
TXiiLAyhxB4,1638640,1646480,the faculty of education and the support  that we're offering  this i think this is probably my  favorite question because um
TXiiLAyhxB4,1646480,1652640,when you become part of the nelson  mandela university family
TXiiLAyhxB4,1652640,1660159,especially in the education  faculty  everything makes complete sense
TXiiLAyhxB4,1660159,1666720,we have slogans here which are followed  to the t for example humanizing pedagogy
TXiiLAyhxB4,1666720,1672960,is probably it's not dna  it's it's so natural now and it's our
TXiiLAyhxB4,1672960,1680320,lecturers  um show it with the way they treat us  the way the content is produced or um
TXiiLAyhxB4,1680320,1685520,relate to us and  even when trouble does come because it's
TXiiLAyhxB4,1685520,1692000,not easy but when problems do come along  we know that we're dealing with humans  who know they're dealing with humans
TXiiLAyhxB4,1692000,1698320,and also my other favorite is that we're  agents of change and we learn that from  first year and it goes all the way
TXiiLAyhxB4,1698320,1704080,through and it just makes i don't know  it makes life here so natural yeah i'm
TXiiLAyhxB4,1704080,1711200,so glad to be listening to you hearing  you talking about our philosophy of  education which is a humanizing pedagogy
TXiiLAyhxB4,1711200,1717679,as well as our mission because our  mission is to  prepare you to become agents of hope
TXiiLAyhxB4,1717679,1724080,change and social justice so kristin  i think for me it's uh
TXiiLAyhxB4,1724080,1730240,more that the university's got this  thing where they say they leave no  student behind  and i think that the faculty of
TXiiLAyhxB4,1730240,1737279,education just epitomizes that to its  best extent  because there's always programs to help
TXiiLAyhxB4,1737279,1742640,there's always you know avenues  but  numbers you can dial someone you can
TXiiLAyhxB4,1742640,1747919,speak to to get help um  i have received a lot of support here in
TXiiLAyhxB4,1747919,1754880,the university especially  because when i first entered here in the  university i had this opinion like you
TXiiLAyhxB4,1754880,1760960,are on your own so  do that and then when i entered here  into the faculty and then
TXiiLAyhxB4,1760960,1767200,into the lecture halls and i found that  no the lectures were very accommodative  and they were very caring of us they
TXiiLAyhxB4,1767200,1773520,understood that we are first years we  have never been exposed in this kind of  situations and then they were so cool to
TXiiLAyhxB4,1773520,1780320,such a point that you were being in a  comfortable space to to to learn and not  be afraid that okay you're no longer in
TXiiLAyhxB4,1780320,1785840,a high school in the university same  applies in here in the resource center  when we got here and then we got so much
TXiiLAyhxB4,1785840,1792640,support and so much help from mums and  other students that were here yeah i  fought home and still now we're helping
TXiiLAyhxB4,1792640,1797120,one another wow thank you thank you for  that
TXiiLAyhxB4,1799760,1804799,so you say that you are studying towards  a pg ed
TXiiLAyhxB4,1804799,1810720,in  leadership  how did you get to know about you know
TXiiLAyhxB4,1810720,1816320,that particular program and how did you  get to decide that you want to do that  because we offer you know a range of
TXiiLAyhxB4,1816320,1822080,qualifications for postgraduate studies  correct so initially i wanted to do a
TXiiLAyhxB4,1822080,1828960,postgraduate  i want to do my honours in educational  psychology  but due to the numbers i didn't make it
TXiiLAyhxB4,1828960,1834960,and then i was informed of the  postgraduate  educate diploma in education and
TXiiLAyhxB4,1834960,1840640,leadership management  currently where i'm working i'm the  subject head so when i heard of this i
TXiiLAyhxB4,1840640,1847679,was like this would be of assistance to  me saying that i am currently in the  leadership  role or position
TXiiLAyhxB4,1847679,1853919,and with you taryn  pgce  well initially i always wanted to become
TXiiLAyhxB4,1853919,1859600,a psychologist still going in that route  don't worry and i completed the sit
TXiiLAyhxB4,1859600,1865519,tesla course at nmu in  2018 worked for three and a half years
TXiiLAyhxB4,1865519,1870799,as an online english facilitator but  always felt stagnant in my job so this
TXiiLAyhxB4,1870799,1878159,is the next step for me in helping  learners reach their goals and their  potential how are your studies funded
TXiiLAyhxB4,1878159,1883360,well initially out of my own pocket too  but after paying i actually received the
TXiiLAyhxB4,1883360,1889039,bgc scholarship award oh you receive how  does that work  well
TXiiLAyhxB4,1889039,1895760,you get a total amount of 35 000 rand  which covers your entire tuition fees
TXiiLAyhxB4,1895760,1900960,unfortunately no book costs or anything  like that but it does cover the majority
TXiiLAyhxB4,1900960,1907600,of things i basically had to pay just my  enrollment fee  all right and a viewer with your hectic
TXiiLAyhxB4,1907600,1913120,schedule that i'm assuming you're you're  having having to manage in a school and
TXiiLAyhxB4,1913120,1918159,later on attending classes how are you  finding that balance so i'm so used to
TXiiLAyhxB4,1918159,1925039,contact learning however when i think of  the petrol costs  having to drive from newton park to
TXiiLAyhxB4,1925039,1932240,missionville campus i'm grateful that  we're currently online  now i can get home settle down and
TXiiLAyhxB4,1932240,1937440,find my feet and do what i need to do  i need to manage my time i think even
TXiiLAyhxB4,1937440,1944080,with when i was doing the pgce i had to  make sure that i managed my time in the  sense that friends aside
TXiiLAyhxB4,1944080,1949440,family  make dates  i guys i don't expect people to just
TXiiLAyhxB4,1949440,1956399,come over and see me i am very busy so  you have to just ask yourself what is it
TXiiLAyhxB4,1956399,1962399,that i want why am i doing this and then  once you can answer those questions it  becomes a bit easier
TXiiLAyhxB4,1962399,1969360,and i was going to ask you what advice  do you have because you are postgraduate  students it means that you've done your
TXiiLAyhxB4,1969360,1974880,undergraduate  qualification you've had experience the  good and the bad
TXiiLAyhxB4,1974880,1982080,and for someone who's sitting at home  wanting to do education what would your  advice be or any kind of qualification
TXiiLAyhxB4,1982080,1989120,you know  what would your advice be to that so  always tell my learners to find your why
TXiiLAyhxB4,1989360,1995360,i think that is very important because  you can be advised to do something but  if that is not what you want
TXiiLAyhxB4,1995360,2001679,so find your why why do you want to do  it um if you're already doing it why are  you doing it is this going to be  fulfilling for you in the next five
TXiiLAyhxB4,2001679,2007200,years is this going to be something that  you're going to be eager to wake up to  each and every day because in each and
TXiiLAyhxB4,2007200,2012480,every work environment there are  challenges yes find your why taryn
TXiiLAyhxB4,2012480,2020000,well i would say that they should find  what they are passionate about  so yeah i would say follow your heart
TXiiLAyhxB4,2020000,2026080,find what you are passionate about and  do that because  like she mentioned you have to find
TXiiLAyhxB4,2026080,2031679,something that you are happy to go to  because you don't want to go to a place  where you're coming home miserable every
TXiiLAyhxB4,2031679,2038640,day  so find what you're passionate about  thank you find your passion
TXiiLAyhxB4,2041840,2048878,hi i'm sitting this afternoon with  nozuko  who is our resource center
TXiiLAyhxB4,2048878,2055599,coordinator  zuko can you briefly tell us about  the kind of work you do in the resource
TXiiLAyhxB4,2055599,2062320,center  oh okay  at the resource center because you can  see we are here this is the resource
TXiiLAyhxB4,2062320,2067440,center space  at the resource center we cater for our
TXiiLAyhxB4,2067440,2074480,education students  across all programs  and we only have a resource center
TXiiLAyhxB4,2074480,2081919,in the faculty of education  the resource center caters only for
TXiiLAyhxB4,2081919,2088878,education students as i said it's a  beautiful  educational workspace
TXiiLAyhxB4,2088878,2094638,that offers and provides  you know our future educators with
TXiiLAyhxB4,2094638,2100800,teaching materials  we have teaching aids can be videos
TXiiLAyhxB4,2100800,2105920,uh chats posters  to make the lesson more interesting
TXiiLAyhxB4,2105920,2112400,when the lesson is more interesting it  means that our students  can remember what they've learned
TXiiLAyhxB4,2112400,2118079,they can understand it  they can apply it in their minds
TXiiLAyhxB4,2118079,2124560,they can analyze and evaluate it and it  makes them  creative all right
TXiiLAyhxB4,2124560,2130720,now nuzuko we we know that you are not  just wearing one cap  we know that you have another
TXiiLAyhxB4,2130720,2137040,responsibility in the faculty that i  know you're very passionate about can  you just tell us a little bit about that
TXiiLAyhxB4,2137040,2145040,responsibility oh thank you so much i'm  really passionate about that  i also coordinated first year experience
TXiiLAyhxB4,2145040,2151920,program  this program actually complements other  programs that we have in the university
TXiiLAyhxB4,2151920,2157280,that are generic  but we we for us we are bringing the
TXiiLAyhxB4,2157280,2162800,support to the students near  in our faculty of education when they
TXiiLAyhxB4,2162800,2168640,transition from the high school to this  university or i can say high learning
TXiiLAyhxB4,2168640,2174240,institution so  for us it is because it you came about
TXiiLAyhxB4,2174240,2179520,actually with it because you experienced  you know hardships and difficulties as
TXiiLAyhxB4,2179520,2187359,well  like myself  and because i did now i understand  exactly the the traumas that our
TXiiLAyhxB4,2187359,2192560,students  can experience  especially for the first few weeks when
TXiiLAyhxB4,2192560,2200640,they start their learning career  so what we do is i start from their
TXiiLAyhxB4,2200640,2207280,their orientation when they when we  oriented them because we realized that  they they have
TXiiLAyhxB4,2207280,2213200,you know when we when we deal with them  they are coming from disadvantaged  schools when i say disadvantaged school
TXiiLAyhxB4,2213200,2219359,it means that they are not ready or  prepared enough  to actually  you know
TXiiLAyhxB4,2219359,2224480,comply with the expectations of the  university  so some
TXiiLAyhxB4,2224480,2230000,are  not computer literate  and because of that and especially at
TXiiLAyhxB4,2230000,2235119,this time of the online learning yes so  we need to be there to understand their
TXiiLAyhxB4,2235119,2240640,difficulties and hold their hands and  solve them  we don't just listen but we make sure
TXiiLAyhxB4,2240640,2247839,that we we um bring solutions and when i  say we it means that our senior student
TXiiLAyhxB4,2247839,2253920,assistants  i'm so proud of them because they are so  passionate like i'm like
TXiiLAyhxB4,2253920,2261880,like myself  they they listen to the students  they tutor they cater everything be it
TXiiLAyhxB4,2261880,2267280,academically or socially if it's  psychological we are not professionals
TXiiLAyhxB4,2267280,2274559,but we actually relate it to the  professionals so that they can assist  where they can
TXiiLAyhxB4,2277839,2284720,good day i am sitting here excited with  the alumni of the faculty of education

TXiiLAyhxB4,2406560,2413599,things that was being punted was the  humanizing pedagogy and  one of the things that really the
TXiiLAyhxB4,2413599,2419680,lecturers and the people that taught in  this particular university but more  specifically within the faculty is that
TXiiLAyhxB4,2419680,2425599,they drove that thing of humanity you  know of um of of lecturers being human
TXiiLAyhxB4,2425599,2430720,before they are lecturers um so  that was the first difference
TXiiLAyhxB4,2430720,2438480,and so some of that right now we we are  using that in in in the classrooms in  which we teach in in a sense that we we
TXiiLAyhxB4,2438480,2445520,now uh we we always take a step back and  allow our learners to actually have  their own say because even they are not
TXiiLAyhxB4,2445520,2451920,empty vessels but they are they come  from communities where they know  something and that all forms part of the
TXiiLAyhxB4,2451920,2459280,process and the learning process that  you find inside classroom uh  let's come to you tvet we're so proud of
TXiiLAyhxB4,2459280,2464880,tvet in this uh faculty  and there has not been formal training
TXiiLAyhxB4,2464880,2471119,of tibet lecturers  in the country and we are one of the few
TXiiLAyhxB4,2471119,2476560,who are really um offering this what has  your experience been you know
TXiiLAyhxB4,2476560,2482000,native sector it was  there was no training on a teaching side
TXiiLAyhxB4,2482000,2487359,remember mostly just people who from the  industry right and then we were just
TXiiLAyhxB4,2487359,2493839,took and just explained to students what  they need to do and there was no wound  because it's a matter of like you say
TXiiLAyhxB4,2493839,2499520,okay guys you know that you need to pass  and if you fail your faith  you know those kind of things that
TXiiLAyhxB4,2499520,2506319,normally happens and by the time they  were shown as the ubuntu  they were specifically specifically
TXiiLAyhxB4,2506319,2512319,telling us that human  humanizing pedagogy is one of our theme
TXiiLAyhxB4,2512319,2517920,is actually our main theme so when we  got the training of teaching everything
TXiiLAyhxB4,2517920,2524240,changed i i guess  creating the nativity teaching was one
TXiiLAyhxB4,2524240,2530720,of the  best ideas whoever came up with that one  but tato you've
TXiiLAyhxB4,2530720,2537920,done teaching practice what we call  school-based learning  and you have been exposed to different
TXiiLAyhxB4,2537920,2544000,contexts  what have you learned from you know  changing from one context to the next
TXiiLAyhxB4,2544000,2552240,sure  um you know if there's one thing that i  appreciate about the faculty is  the strong emphasis it did or the
TXiiLAyhxB4,2552240,2557280,so much energy that it puts on in savers  teacher training um because i think it
TXiiLAyhxB4,2557280,2564480,is only through that when i was able to  decide if whether do i really want to do  this  you know and reading everything that you
TXiiLAyhxB4,2564480,2569599,see in the study guide and now you have  to see it practical and sometimes you  look at the theory and you look at the
TXiiLAyhxB4,2569599,2575359,situation you're like  you know there's a  it's very it's very difficult to sort of
TXiiLAyhxB4,2575359,2581280,immediately merge the two i think it  comes with experience  i've had the opportunity to be in
TXiiLAyhxB4,2581280,2587920,private schools to be in a public school  as well  and i've seen  how fortunate some schools are with
TXiiLAyhxB4,2587920,2593680,resources and how some schools have to  do with how some schools have to do what  they have to do with the little means
TXiiLAyhxB4,2593680,2600000,that they have and how do you also try  to  make sure that you the best results come
TXiiLAyhxB4,2600000,2606720,out of whatever type of school that you  are in using the little resources that  you have so i think
TXiiLAyhxB4,2606720,2612880,for me the experience has groomed me not  only to to think outside the box
TXiiLAyhxB4,2612880,2618160,all right no thanks lucanio let's come  to you  and the question here is
TXiiLAyhxB4,2618160,2623200,do you think we have prepared you  enough
TXiiLAyhxB4,2623200,2628720,for you to be able to teach  in school madame dean i i don't think
TXiiLAyhxB4,2628720,2636400,that universities can  ever do enough to prepare people for the  real context situations that we find in
TXiiLAyhxB4,2636400,2643760,in schools  one of the things that i've realized is  being in doing sbl school-based learning
TXiiLAyhxB4,2643760,2650560,is very different to being in a  classroom and you being in charge of  that particular classroom and you being
TXiiLAyhxB4,2650560,2655599,in the lead in that particular classroom  when you are doing your spl there are  times where you have to sit at the back
TXiiLAyhxB4,2655599,2661359,and you watch the teacher and you are  doing observations but and then you just  get a
TXiiLAyhxB4,2661359,2667839,period here to do a one lesson here one  lesson there however it is different  when you have to do it each and every
TXiiLAyhxB4,2667839,2673119,day day in and day out where you need to  bring your a game day in and day out so
TXiiLAyhxB4,2673119,2678240,that  learners at the end of the day are able  to understand what what you are saying
TXiiLAyhxB4,2678240,2683440,you know it's the passion it's it's the  drive you know it's knowing that this is
TXiiLAyhxB4,2683440,2689599,this is i think this is what i was you  know i was born for this is what i was  this is just something that i need to do
TXiiLAyhxB4,2689599,2695440,yeah well thanks for that going back to  tv because people do not think  that
TXiiLAyhxB4,2695440,2700640,uh people in tv need to be trained to  become specialists
TXiiLAyhxB4,2700640,2707440,you know of teaching and learning in  their own spaces what has it meant for  you you know coming back you were
TXiiLAyhxB4,2707440,2712560,already uh working  and you were saying uh that you were
TXiiLAyhxB4,2712560,2720800,just teaching you know content and you  know you pass your fail but what has it  meant to you getting this qualification
TXiiLAyhxB4,2720800,2728000,well by the time we  were actually uh  learning what before we get qualified of
TXiiLAyhxB4,2728000,2734160,the qualifications  the times when you get to class you feel  like you know what today let me just
TXiiLAyhxB4,2734160,2740160,rather forget about my old self let me  just try to apply what it has been said
TXiiLAyhxB4,2740160,2747839,in class  in a classroom during that time  and  when you just get to it you find out in
TXiiLAyhxB4,2747839,2755040,no man there was there is a huge  difference from from what i was before  and what i have done today because i
TXiiLAyhxB4,2755040,2762319,remember with my colleagues that we were  doing the same course we would after  class when we're free call others like
TXiiLAyhxB4,2762319,2768640,guys we learned this in in missionville  today and i tried to apply this in my  class and
TXiiLAyhxB4,2768640,2773680,like the the positive that i've the  feedback which i received from my
TXiiLAyhxB4,2773680,2781119,student  it was  way way better than yesterday so i  should say the experience i
TXiiLAyhxB4,2781119,2787200,for me i'm just grateful for that  experience but thanks so much for your  time and the experience that you've
