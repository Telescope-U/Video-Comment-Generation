NCSEJQQboRk,1497279,1500440,his tadpoles
NCSEJQQboRk,1504320,1510240,now this was a strange creature  it looked like a tadpole  sort of
NCSEJQQboRk,1510240,1515440,swam like a tadpole kind of but it had  legs almost no tail
NCSEJQQboRk,1515440,1522640,not like a tadpole  [Music]

NCSEJQQboRk,1536640,1542480,george knew that someday he'd have to  tell bill he'd lost the tadpoles and he
NCSEJQQboRk,1542480,1546799,knew he might never see his little  friends again
NCSEJQQboRk,1548720,1556840,back in the city george tried to take  his mind off the tadpoles  it wasn't easy
NCSEJQQboRk,1557450,1562930,[Music]  [Applause]

NCSEJQQboRk,1632799,1639279,and into what  george we've been looking all over for  you  you got like 800 pounds of boiled
NCSEJQQboRk,1639279,1644799,lettuce  now george really had to get back to the
NCSEJQQboRk,1644799,1652760,lake  but it was weeks before he could go
NCSEJQQboRk,1653190,1659810,[Laughter]  luckily george didn't see any signs of  jumbo tadpoles
NCSEJQQboRk,1659810,1664109,[Music]
NCSEJQQboRk,1667279,1671120,but he couldn't find his friends either
NCSEJQQboRk,1676799,1683720,these loud frogs probably scared the  tadpoles away  huh
NCSEJQQboRk,1683840,1689120,it was time for george to tell bill he'd  lost the tadpoles
NCSEJQQboRk,1689120,1691919,hey george
NCSEJQQboRk,1694480,1701440,uh  that was a good idea to release my  tadpoles into their natural habitat

NCSEJQQboRk,3093230,3101599,[Music]  but the hole didn't look so bad when  there was yellow paper inside
NCSEJQQboRk,3105680,3111710,that was it  he didn't need a new hat he needed to  patch the hole
NCSEJQQboRk,3111710,3116800,[Music]  the paper looked good
