h81ig75oYbc,26480,27920,main talking point this week which is
h81ig75oYbc,27920,30880,how much do tour de france bikes weigh
h81ig75oYbc,30880,33359,today
h81ig75oYbc,34780,46160,[Music]
h81ig75oYbc,46160,47440,first up though we're gonna have a look
h81ig75oYbc,47440,48879,at some of the comments from last week's
h81ig75oYbc,48879,51120,show where we spoke about
h81ig75oYbc,51120,53600,cycling products that you regret buying
h81ig75oYbc,53600,55280,i know i did enjoy that show and i
h81ig75oYbc,55280,56719,thought i'd kick off with the comment
h81ig75oYbc,56719,58879,that i found on last week's show which
h81ig75oYbc,58879,61199,is from another youtuber i regret buying
h81ig75oYbc,61199,63199,high end components middle tier stuff
h81ig75oYbc,63199,65439,works just fine and i'm less grumpy when
h81ig75oYbc,65439,68400,i break it or wear it out and he's never
h81ig75oYbc,68400,70320,seen any meaningful differences in time
h81ig75oYbc,70320,71520,which is interesting one yeah there's a
h81ig75oYbc,71520,72720,lot to be said for that it's basically
h81ig75oYbc,72720,74479,why i don't like really expensive
h81ig75oYbc,74479,75520,watches
h81ig75oYbc,75520,77439,as well because they do the same thing
h81ig75oYbc,77439,78720,they just stress you out it's the same
h81ig75oYbc,78720,81439,thing as a 10 pound casio 50 meter water
h81ig75oYbc,81439,82640,resist
h81ig75oYbc,82640,85280,yeah anyway next comment is from from
h81ig75oYbc,85280,87360,strawhorn one who says the biggest
h81ig75oYbc,87360,88960,regret was buying a cheap bike from
h81ig75oYbc,88960,90640,amazon when i was younger and struggling
h81ig75oYbc,90640,92479,for cash i was desperate to get back
h81ig75oYbc,92479,94320,into cycling went for a quick purchase
h81ig75oYbc,94320,96159,didn't do any research and all i can say
h81ig75oYbc,96159,98840,is that it was good going downhill
h81ig75oYbc,98840,100720,um think it was made out of solid steel
h81ig75oYbc,100720,101680,rods
h81ig75oYbc,101680,104000,similar to the fourth rail bridge as for
h81ig75oYbc,104000,105920,uphill the gradient wasn't an issue as i
h81ig75oYbc,105920,107920,just rolled them flat with the weight
h81ig75oYbc,107920,111119,but i think the weight was measured um
h81ig75oYbc,111119,113680,for the older viewers i think
h81ig75oYbc,113680,115280,yeah that's a bit like what we'd say
h81ig75oYbc,115280,117759,about the amazon bike yeah it's
h81ig75oYbc,117759,119920,absolutely terrible going uphill but
h81ig75oYbc,119920,121360,yeah you can kind of roll it going
h81ig75oYbc,121360,123280,downhill yeah if you it's like that
h81ig75oYbc,123280,125520,isn't it you buy cheap you buy twice
h81ig75oYbc,125520,127520,exactly that kind of thing right next
h81ig75oYbc,127520,129679,one in from norman lindsay biggest
h81ig75oYbc,129679,132400,regret purchase was 45 years ago real
h81ig75oYbc,132400,134319,shammy in your shorts was just
h81ig75oYbc,134319,135520,disappearing and i bought a pair of
h81ig75oYbc,135520,137680,shorts with lamb's wool chamois for the
h81ig75oYbc,137680,138640,winter
h81ig75oYbc,138640,141520,advertised as a nice warm in the cold
h81ig75oYbc,141520,143840,scottish weather never had so many
h81ig75oYbc,143840,146080,subtle stores um yeah yeah well
h81ig75oYbc,146080,147440,something i don't think is something i
h81ig75oYbc,147440,148480,wouldn't make
h81ig75oYbc,148480,150720,twice that same mistake i wouldn't
h81ig75oYbc,150720,153840,regret buying the uh gcn castelli uh

h81ig75oYbc,162640,165120,uh john burnell he says he once bought
h81ig75oYbc,165120,167920,tri-bars for a mountain bike right and
h81ig75oYbc,167920,169920,he was a young teen at the time he

h81ig75oYbc,179040,181360,regret buying carbon rim break bikes
h81ig75oYbc,181360,182800,i'll never forget the sound of money
h81ig75oYbc,182800,185599,rubbing away when i put the brakes on do
h81ig75oYbc,185599,187360,you know what that's so true you also
h81ig75oYbc,187360,189040,but i also remember that not stopping in
h81ig75oYbc,189040,191920,the wet yeah it's the the dawn of disc
h81ig75oYbc,191920,193440,brakes and it changed everything because
h81ig75oYbc,193440,196159,i remember braking so hard on those rim
h81ig75oYbc,196159,199200,brake on the rim break on rim on carbon
h81ig75oYbc,199200,200560,rims yeah and
h81ig75oYbc,200560,202560,yeah you can just see it it's pants
h81ig75oYbc,202560,203680,though isn't it you can just see it
h81ig75oYbc,203680,205680,wearing away yeah you know that thousand
h81ig75oYbc,205680,207280,pounds worth of wheels
h81ig75oYbc,207280,210080,well kevin mchugh uh wrote my favorite
h81ig75oYbc,210080,212560,comment which is i regret buying my wife
h81ig75oYbc,212560,215120,a good bike i'm now getting dropped on

h81ig75oYbc,218239,220319,kevin yeah
h81ig75oYbc,220319,222640,i don't know what to say to that
h81ig75oYbc,222640,224400,ollie before we dive in to the main
h81ig75oYbc,224400,225599,talking point i just want to clear
h81ig75oYbc,225599,227840,something up i had a quick look at uh
h81ig75oYbc,227840,230319,last week's tech show and you said this
h81ig75oYbc,230319,232159,yeah and we didn't trust hank to do the
h81ig75oYbc,232159,234400,show without us there so under our
h81ig75oYbc,234400,236560,supervision
h81ig75oYbc,236560,238239,right mate
h81ig75oYbc,238239,240720,no faith what do you think i was gonna
h81ig75oYbc,240720,243200,get up to uh
h81ig75oYbc,243200,246239,not sure um oh yeah
h81ig75oYbc,246239,248000,whoa whoa whoa hank well i'm i'm glad
h81ig75oYbc,248000,250000,you're here now thanks mate
h81ig75oYbc,250000,251439,our main talking point this week is
h81ig75oYbc,251439,253920,about how much the tour de france bikes
h81ig75oYbc,253920,256239,now tour de france riders are the best
h81ig75oYbc,256239,258239,of the best so you'd expect they get to
h81ig75oYbc,258239,260799,ride the best of the best
h81ig75oYbc,260799,263440,but the weight of their bikes i think it
h81ig75oYbc,263440,265840,might actually surprise some people yeah
h81ig75oYbc,265840,267680,and the thing to kick off with is that
h81ig75oYbc,267680,270240,the uci the governing body of cycling
h81ig75oYbc,270240,273680,have set a weight limit of 6.8 kilograms
h81ig75oYbc,273680,275759,now this is for safety reasons because
h81ig75oYbc,275759,277280,they don't want the manufacturers to get
h81ig75oYbc,277280,279919,carried away making bikes out of
h81ig75oYbc,279919,281600,i don't know bolster wood and it's
h81ig75oYbc,281600,282400,become
h81ig75oYbc,282400,285440,unsafe yeah absolutely but uh give some
h81ig75oYbc,285440,288240,context as to what 6.8 kilograms
h81ig75oYbc,288240,290800,actually sort of is in real terms that
h81ig75oYbc,290800,292240,people can understand
h81ig75oYbc,292240,294320,i've well i got my scales out did some
h81ig75oYbc,294320,297759,weighing did you yeah so go on typically
h81ig75oYbc,297759,301120,a five month old baby is is about seven
h81ig75oYbc,301120,305120,kilos who's back if you'd be weighed
h81ig75oYbc,306080,308960,yeah what's sex uh well
h81ig75oYbc,308960,311680,a pack of 70 well 75 packs of playing
h81ig75oYbc,311680,315280,cards yeah i heard 12 six basketballs 12
h81ig75oYbc,315280,318479,basketballs 15 ipad airs
h81ig75oYbc,318479,320479,well there you go you've got an idea now
h81ig75oYbc,320479,322560,of what 6.8 kilograms is it's not it's
h81ig75oYbc,322560,324160,not much right it's only right ollie
h81ig75oYbc,324160,325520,that we started off this section with
h81ig75oYbc,325520,327440,the reigning tour de france champion
h81ig75oYbc,327440,330160,paddy paul gotcha in his corner now he's
h81ig75oYbc,330160,334479,riding a v3 rs isn't he he is although
h81ig75oYbc,334479,337199,uh this year he we think he's probably
h81ig75oYbc,337199,338479,going to be riding a yaz of yet
h81ig75oYbc,338479,340240,unreleased bike which was probably the
h81ig75oYbc,340240,342400,v4 rs so probably
h81ig75oYbc,342400,344000,slightly lighter and that is really in
h81ig75oYbc,344000,345680,the past but it has to be said though he
h81ig75oYbc,345680,347759,loves a light bike doesn't he he's
h81ig75oYbc,347759,349919,really uh nitpicky he likes it to be
h81ig75oYbc,349919,351840,perfect and the bite that we've seen
h81ig75oYbc,351840,354400,before he's actually taken away all the
h81ig75oYbc,354400,356560,paint on it he's kept it really nice a
h81ig75oYbc,356560,358319,naked carbon which i think gives a
h81ig75oYbc,358319,359919,really nice look to it and just added
h81ig75oYbc,359919,362319,the stickers for the logos and then he's
h81ig75oYbc,362319,364160,also been known to use
h81ig75oYbc,364160,366479,rim break in the mountains to keep the
h81ig75oYbc,366479,369680,weight down and those um those bora
h81ig75oYbc,369680,372639,uh campbell nola yeah
h81ig75oYbc,372639,374880,yeah tubular wheels in the mountains
h81ig75oYbc,374880,376720,that's right and he kind of kept it to
h81ig75oYbc,376720,378080,the weight limit as well didn't he yeah
h81ig75oYbc,378080,380560,and in doing so he has a bike that is as
h81ig75oYbc,380560,382639,close to 6.8 as possible
h81ig75oYbc,382639,385360,maybe 6.85 or something like that
h81ig75oYbc,385360,386160,but
h81ig75oYbc,386160,388479,when he rides on the flatter stage he is
h81ig75oYbc,388479,390000,less preoccupied with weight and his
h81ig75oYbc,390000,391840,power to weight ratio and we typically
h81ig75oYbc,391840,394880,see him using disc brakes and tubeless
h81ig75oYbc,394880,396400,campagnolo wheels that are slightly
h81ig75oYbc,396400,397520,deeper
h81ig75oYbc,397520,398720,and a bit heavier and in this
h81ig75oYbc,398720,400639,configuration where weight is less
h81ig75oYbc,400639,402160,important on the flat his bike is
h81ig75oYbc,402160,405759,typically around 7.2 7.3 kilograms and
h81ig75oYbc,405759,408560,well we actually weighed one that has
h81ig75oYbc,408560,410319,tubular wheels on so not the tubeless
h81ig75oYbc,410319,411919,wheels so that adds a bit of weight with
h81ig75oYbc,411919,413440,disc brakes with disc brakes and that
h81ig75oYbc,413440,416880,came out at 7.1 kilograms yeah so there
h81ig75oYbc,416880,419599,you go is he going to be on that 6.8 on
h81ig75oYbc,419599,423120,the dot then come tomorrow i i would bet
h81ig75oYbc,423120,424880,so i think we should work out then what
h81ig75oYbc,424880,427360,how other bikes compare um and what
h81ig75oYbc,427360,430080,their weight is so moving on to ineos
h81ig75oYbc,430080,432080,got an ideas now they use what was that
h81ig75oYbc,432080,433759,accent then
h81ig75oYbc,433759,436240,your meals
h81ig75oYbc,436960,439199,f now i wouldn't say the pinnerella f is
h81ig75oYbc,439199,441520,known to be a super lightweight bike no
h81ig75oYbc,441520,442720,it's not but the interesting thing here
h81ig75oYbc,442720,444960,is that they previously used like last
h81ig75oYbc,444960,446639,year's racing race port
h81ig75oYbc,446639,449199,the rim brake version they did okay and
h81ig75oYbc,449199,450880,that was the pinnacle especially
h81ig75oYbc,450880,453199,as well yeah and they were desperate to
h81ig75oYbc,453199,454400,try and keep the weight down even
h81ig75oYbc,454400,456720,further so they used a special ultra
h81ig75oYbc,456720,458400,light version of the bike uh with a
h81ig75oYbc,458400,460240,different carbon and they paired it with
h81ig75oYbc,460240,462800,lightweight milenstein wheels which are
h81ig75oYbc,462800,464479,like the lightest wheels you can get
h81ig75oYbc,464479,466879,pretty much um and this was all in a bid
h81ig75oYbc,466879,470400,to get as close to 6.8 as possible um so
h81ig75oYbc,470400,471120,we
h81ig75oYbc,471120,473360,well we've weighed one of the 2022 disc
h81ig75oYbc,473360,475039,brake bikes this was luke plapp's bike
h81ig75oYbc,475039,477520,it's the aussie champion um and this
h81ig75oYbc,477520,480800,came in at 7.16 kilograms so he was the
h81ig75oYbc,480800,484000,duras c50s so i reckon if you went
h81ig75oYbc,484000,486160,shallower you could well maybe save 200
h81ig75oYbc,486160,487759,grams yeah shallower wheels would make a
h81ig75oYbc,487759,489360,bit of difference
h81ig75oYbc,489360,490879,but the interesting thing is is he's
h81ig75oYbc,490879,493840,quite small so garen thomas um who's a
h81ig75oYbc,493840,495199,bit bigger than the team leader right
h81ig75oYbc,495199,497199,yeah rides a big one actually rides the
h81ig75oYbc,497199,500160,same size of pinnarello f as me
h81ig75oYbc,500160,502400,and that's where the comparison stops
h81ig75oYbc,502400,505039,isn't it yeah well anyway uh i so i can
h81ig75oYbc,505039,507759,weigh that bike i've got one and i would
h81ig75oYbc,507759,509360,say he he's probably his bike's gonna be
h81ig75oYbc,509360,511840,around 7.2 7.3 kilograms so it's still
h81ig75oYbc,511840,514320,it's still close to 6.8 but it's not on
h81ig75oYbc,514320,516240,the dot is it no it's not so i reckon we
h81ig75oYbc,516240,517518,should have a look at another bike to
h81ig75oYbc,517518,519440,see if it's close to that 6.8 limit what
h81ig75oYbc,519440,521440,about tebow pinot's box
h81ig75oYbc,521440,524399,steve pino is a grand tour specialist
h81ig75oYbc,524399,526080,he's actually proven to perform in the
h81ig75oYbc,526080,528480,mountains so he's used to riding a light
h81ig75oYbc,528480,531360,bike and he's on the lapierre zealous sl
h81ig75oYbc,531360,533200,so that's the uh super light version is
h81ig75oYbc,533200,535279,it it is and he's quite well he's quite
h81ig75oYbc,535279,537839,tall for a pro rider yeah he's 180
h81ig75oYbc,537839,540720,centimeters um and so he rides a sort of
h81ig75oYbc,540720,542560,larger bike than some and
h81ig75oYbc,542560,544000,as a consequence his bike is a little
h81ig75oYbc,544000,546320,bit heavier it's coming in at 7.34
h81ig75oYbc,546320,548720,kilograms yeah but the thing here is
h81ig75oYbc,548720,550640,that at the moment we weigh a lot of
h81ig75oYbc,550640,553120,bikes when we go to races and we find
h81ig75oYbc,553120,556600,that that is typical like around 7 to
h81ig75oYbc,556600,558160,7.3
h81ig75oYbc,558160,561519,is typical of what most riders are using
h81ig75oYbc,561519,563760,even team leaders and climbers yeah
h81ig75oYbc,563760,565519,because i mean when i was racing i was
h81ig75oYbc,565519,567519,riding in the canyon air road and mine
h81ig75oYbc,567519,569440,was sitting and i'm a small rider i ride
h81ig75oYbc,569440,571519,a 51 so i go really small and i was
h81ig75oYbc,571519,575360,around you know 7.3 so not many riders
h81ig75oYbc,575360,577920,are in the six kilo mark um but i reckon
h81ig75oYbc,577920,579120,you should check out one of the aero
h81ig75oYbc,579120,581279,bikes from a sprinter and see if they've
h81ig75oYbc,581279,583279,gone totally well sprinters are just
h81ig75oYbc,583279,584880,much bigger riders aren't they they're
h81ig75oYbc,584880,587519,less bothered about weights so dylan
h81ig75oYbc,587519,591839,corona vegan spike what was that accent
h81ig75oYbc,591839,593839,so this is dylan's bite it's the giant
h81ig75oYbc,593839,595920,propel now this is giant's most
h81ig75oYbc,595920,597839,aerodynamic bike so how does this
h81ig75oYbc,597839,599680,compare to the other bikes previously
h81ig75oYbc,599680,601440,because this is all about aerodynamics
h81ig75oYbc,601440,604480,it's their speedy bike and one for the
h81ig75oYbc,604480,606320,you know the high speeds now dylan's
h81ig75oYbc,606320,609839,bike we weighed it and it raised 7.59
h81ig75oYbc,609839,612079,kilograms which is actually the heaviest
h81ig75oYbc,612079,614560,bike that we've seen so obviously
h81ig75oYbc,614560,617440,they've gone for speed over lightweight
h81ig75oYbc,617440,620399,in the mountains yeah and overall
h81ig75oYbc,620399,622160,there's a trend that's happened in the
h81ig75oYbc,622160,624959,over the last five to ten years bikes
h81ig75oYbc,624959,627040,have become heavier yeah but this is
h81ig75oYbc,627040,628800,because they've also become more
h81ig75oYbc,628800,631120,aerodynamic with more aerodynamic tube
h81ig75oYbc,631120,632640,shapes and they've had hydraulic disc
h81ig75oYbc,632640,634560,brakes added and we're also increasingly
h81ig75oYbc,634560,637279,seeing riders using tubeless tyres and
h81ig75oYbc,637279,640320,wheels over tubulars which have lower
h81ig75oYbc,640320,642720,rolling resistance but they're slightly
h81ig75oYbc,642720,644800,heavier around 200 grams now i guess
h81ig75oYbc,644800,646320,what this means is bikes typically
h81ig75oYbc,646320,648399,heavier than they were five to ten years
h81ig75oYbc,648399,650320,ago which is actually something quite
h81ig75oYbc,650320,651760,surprising yeah it feels like a
h81ig75oYbc,651760,653920,backwards step yeah i mean it was common
h81ig75oYbc,653920,656160,for mechanics to have to add weight to
h81ig75oYbc,656160,658560,the bikes to make them up yeah to the
h81ig75oYbc,658560,660399,6.8 legal limit
h81ig75oYbc,660399,662000,so here well example here is naira
h81ig75oYbc,662000,665120,quintana's bike from 2018 five years ago
h81ig75oYbc,665120,667600,or four years ago um and this canyon
h81ig75oYbc,667600,669279,ultimate with room brakes they were
h81ig75oYbc,669279,670720,adding like little lead fishing weights
h81ig75oYbc,670720,672160,down the seat tube just to make sure
h81ig75oYbc,672160,675360,they hit that 6.8 kilogram limit but
h81ig75oYbc,675360,677360,that doesn't happen anymore does it um
h81ig75oYbc,677360,680480,it doesn't but these heavier bikes
h81ig75oYbc,680480,682399,although slightly heavier are faster
h81ig75oYbc,682399,684320,yeah but how does that make any sense i
h81ig75oYbc,684320,686880,like bikes a faster bike well i thought
h81ig75oYbc,686880,688079,i thought you'd say that hank but the
h81ig75oYbc,688079,691680,answer is because of science uh so
h81ig75oYbc,691680,693680,basically weight is is large is
h81ig75oYbc,693680,695519,overrated obviously weight does make a
h81ig75oYbc,695519,696959,difference but the important thing to
h81ig75oYbc,696959,699519,remember is on a climb like alp dues
h81ig75oYbc,699519,700880,which is a great example it's in this
h81ig75oYbc,700880,702880,year's tour de france as a summit finish
h81ig75oYbc,702880,705440,um five watts
h81ig75oYbc,705440,707519,will make more difference than one
h81ig75oYbc,707519,709760,kilogram and at the speeds that the pros
h81ig75oYbc,709760,711440,ride up the climb
h81ig75oYbc,711440,712560,you know
h81ig75oYbc,712560,714399,25 to 30 kilometers an hour because
h81ig75oYbc,714399,717279,they're pros at that point aerodynamics
h81ig75oYbc,717279,719519,is significant and so having a more aero
h81ig75oYbc,719519,720800,bike makes a little bit of difference
h81ig75oYbc,720800,722639,and then lower rolling resistance from
h81ig75oYbc,722639,725760,tubeless tires also makes a difference
h81ig75oYbc,725760,728000,and you know the bikes aren't a kilo
h81ig75oYbc,728000,729600,heavier they're typically just around
h81ig75oYbc,729600,733040,300 to 400 grams heavier so i guess what
h81ig75oYbc,733040,734800,we're saying here is the good news is
h81ig75oYbc,734800,736959,you could buy a bike that is lighter
h81ig75oYbc,736959,738880,than the bikes that they are riding in
h81ig75oYbc,738880,741040,the tour de france today all you have to
h81ig75oYbc,741040,743200,do is buy a bike from five years ago and
h81ig75oYbc,743200,744560,maybe get a rembrandt version yeah you
h81ig75oYbc,744560,746399,could pick up a nice used bargain there
h81ig75oYbc,746399,748639,you go but let us know your thoughts uh
h81ig75oYbc,748639,749920,on this and
h81ig75oYbc,749920,752000,we're also interested to know well what
h81ig75oYbc,752000,753120,you think
h81ig75oYbc,753120,755680,are the bikes of 10 years ago that the
h81ig75oYbc,755680,757279,pros were using
h81ig75oYbc,757279,759279,better or nicer than the bikes that
h81ig75oYbc,759279,762000,they're using now yeah let us know is it
h81ig75oYbc,762000,765680,all about weight in your opinion
h81ig75oYbc,768000,770000,time now for hot tech and first up this
h81ig75oYbc,770000,771600,week we've got a new bike which was
h81ig75oYbc,771600,773920,spotted at la walter cerrone being
h81ig75oYbc,773920,775920,written by trek segafredo riders tom
h81ig75oYbc,775920,779360,squeenge yeah you did that correctly
h81ig75oYbc,779360,782560,yeah uh this is one new trek madonne
h81ig75oYbc,782560,784160,that is not been released but it's been
h81ig75oYbc,784160,785760,released tomorrow
h81ig75oYbc,785760,787440,at the grammar part of the tour de
h81ig75oYbc,787440,788800,france in copenhagen what a way to
h81ig75oYbc,788800,791760,launch a bike yeah pretty cool yeah um
h81ig75oYbc,791760,793200,but yeah the interesting thing here is
h81ig75oYbc,793200,795120,it looks very similar to the previous
h81ig75oYbc,795120,797200,trek modern until you look at it from
h81ig75oYbc,797200,798720,the rear straight on and you see that
h81ig75oYbc,798720,800560,it's got this big hole
h81ig75oYbc,800560,802639,in where the seat post is which is
h81ig75oYbc,802639,805600,presumably to make it more aerodynamic
h81ig75oYbc,805600,806399,but
h81ig75oYbc,806399,808480,as of the time filming this we've not
h81ig75oYbc,808480,810720,had any numbers or official data
h81ig75oYbc,810720,812320,released about the bike we're sure that
h81ig75oYbc,812320,814399,it's going to arrive tomorrow but yeah
h81ig75oYbc,814399,816320,pretty pretty far out yeah and we've
h81ig75oYbc,816320,818800,also seen some hot tech uh in the form
h81ig75oYbc,818800,821680,of sunglasses and we know segan he likes
h81ig75oYbc,821680,824639,to be quite flamboyant and he does so in
h81ig75oYbc,824639,826160,his winning ways and his celebrations
h81ig75oYbc,826160,829519,but also in his designs too and 100 his
h81ig75oYbc,829519,831920,partners uh his sunglass partner have
h81ig75oYbc,831920,834079,also gone with their tour de france or a
h81ig75oYbc,834079,835760,new tour de france collaboration with
h81ig75oYbc,835760,837199,him and they got for this kind of
h81ig75oYbc,837199,840079,tie-dye look on the frame and then for
h81ig75oYbc,840079,842720,the lenses he's got these anodized
h81ig75oYbc,842720,843839,purple
h81ig75oYbc,843839,845360,smart which
h81ig75oYbc,845360,847120,in the classic big lenses i think they
h81ig75oYbc,847120,848959,look really cool anyway um make sure you
h81ig75oYbc,848959,850000,check those out because yeah they're
h81ig75oYbc,850000,851040,pretty they're pretty wicked if you're
h81ig75oYbc,851040,852880,honest yeah love sags i hope he gets a
h81ig75oYbc,852880,855040,hope he gets a stage this year yeah i
h81ig75oYbc,855040,858880,just want to see the hulk back yeah
h81ig75oYbc,860399,862240,you got that bit
h81ig75oYbc,862240,865240,on to aero news now and ollie you
h81ig75oYbc,865240,868320,absolutely love getting its aero as
h81ig75oYbc,868320,870560,humanly possible don't you and so some
h81ig75oYbc,870560,872720,good news for you because at the tour of
h81ig75oYbc,872720,875279,france on the grander park on the 13.2
h81ig75oYbc,875279,877839,kilometer type trail tomorrow vanderbolt
h81ig75oYbc,877839,880000,is going to be sporting a new skin suit
h81ig75oYbc,880000,881920,and this one is said to be a banger it's
h81ig75oYbc,881920,883600,not just me that loves skin suits though
h81ig75oYbc,883600,886959,the ladies they love skin suits as well
h81ig75oYbc,886959,889680,not the one i know anyhow vanderpool's
h81ig75oYbc,889680,891600,skin suit has not actually been done by
h81ig75oYbc,891600,893760,his uh team's clothing partner alps in
h81ig75oYbc,893760,895920,phoenix which is kalas it's actually
h81ig75oYbc,895920,898079,been done in collaboration with vortech
h81ig75oYbc,898079,900160,who are the guys at their sports
h81ig75oYbc,900160,903199,engineering hub in silverstone um and
h81ig75oYbc,903199,904639,they've devised the skin suit right
h81ig75oYbc,904639,905920,which is supposed to be super super
h81ig75oYbc,905920,908440,aerodynamic and really high tech
h81ig75oYbc,908440,910800,2750 pounds if you want one yeah it's
h81ig75oYbc,910800,912800,said to be used to like a different or
h81ig75oYbc,912800,914480,new material bad isn't it it's so
h81ig75oYbc,914480,917040,expensive 2750 pounds for a skin too i
h81ig75oYbc,917040,919040,mean and also it's only about that big
h81ig75oYbc,919040,921360,don't get much of it um imagine crashing
h81ig75oYbc,921360,922480,in that though that'd be it's going to
h81ig75oYbc,922480,923920,be expensive isn't it what's crazy is
h81ig75oYbc,923920,926160,that's worth the same amount as you know
h81ig75oYbc,926160,927680,peugeot 106.
h81ig75oYbc,927680,929759,yeah well yeah but it gains and he's
h81ig75oYbc,929759,930959,going to be well he's been doing pretty
h81ig75oYbc,930959,933199,well in time trials of late vanderpool
h81ig75oYbc,933199,934639,so he's got a chance on a show he's not
h81ig75oYbc,934639,936560,a favorite it's going to be philippo
h81ig75oYbc,936560,937839,ghana yeah
h81ig75oYbc,937839,940160,who also has some new tech in the form
h81ig75oYbc,940160,942560,of the new pinarello beliede which we
h81ig75oYbc,942560,946000,saw uh at the tour de swiss um
h81ig75oYbc,946000,948720,two weeks ago uh being ridden by the the
h81ig75oYbc,948720,950560,ineos team including garen thomas on way
h81ig75oYbc,950560,952800,to victory but it was covered up with
h81ig75oYbc,952800,954560,with a wrap so you couldn't it looked
h81ig75oYbc,954560,955839,pretty cool there i'd like belide
h81ig75oYbc,955839,957360,written all over it but you couldn't
h81ig75oYbc,957360,958959,really see it that well so it'd be nice
h81ig75oYbc,958959,960480,to see that finally unveiled you'd
h81ig75oYbc,960480,962079,imagine that's the case
h81ig75oYbc,962079,964720,again no big details have been announced
h81ig75oYbc,964720,965519,on this bike because it's not been
h81ig75oYbc,965519,967600,officially released but the big thing we
h81ig75oYbc,967600,969440,can see is that it's now disbreak the
h81ig75oYbc,969440,972160,previous believe day was room break
h81ig75oYbc,972160,973920,and is the disparate version where
h81ig75oYbc,973920,975680,dynamic
h81ig75oYbc,975680,977519,i don't know we'll find out we'll find
h81ig75oYbc,977519,981000,out tomorrow
h81ig75oYbc,982800,984639,time now hank's favorite part of the
h81ig75oYbc,984639,987680,show it's the freaking bike bar
h81ig75oYbc,987680,988959,now you may be wondering why we've
h81ig75oYbc,988959,991600,suddenly cut and hank has disappeared
h81ig75oYbc,991600,992959,that's for good reason
h81ig75oYbc,992959,994320,hank just can't be trusted with the buy
h81ig75oYbc,994320,996320,vault i'm afraid and he gets far too
h81ig75oYbc,996320,998720,excited and just super nicest every
h81ig75oYbc,998720,1000399,single bike so
h81ig75oYbc,1000399,1004480,i've done a fake bike vault with hank um
h81ig75oYbc,1004480,1007600,and now he's gone and i'm gonna do the
h81ig75oYbc,1007600,1010240,actual bifold
h81ig75oYbc,1010240,1012240,so first up this week's most super nice
h81ig75oYbc,1012240,1014160,bike is from paint killer it's a
h81ig75oYbc,1014160,1016000,pinnarello f12
h81ig75oYbc,1016000,1016800,check
h81ig75oYbc,1016800,1018959,this out this thing is absolutely off
h81ig75oYbc,1018959,1020959,the charts what an outrageous paint job
h81ig75oYbc,1020959,1022959,that is with like dripping red all over
h81ig75oYbc,1022959,1025038,it it looks incredible
h81ig75oYbc,1025038,1026079,um
h81ig75oYbc,1026079,1028720,however this is a professional paint job
h81ig75oYbc,1028720,1030480,that's been done this bike yet i can't
h81ig75oYbc,1030480,1032480,forgive the fact that it's not in big
h81ig75oYbc,1032480,1034558,east malls and the wheels aren't
h81ig75oYbc,1034558,1036880,properly aligned so despite that being
