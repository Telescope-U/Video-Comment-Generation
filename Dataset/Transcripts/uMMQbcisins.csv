uMMQbcisins,29430,30263,I like it.
uMMQbcisins,30263,31213,I'm gonna keep it.
uMMQbcisins,31213,32099,"A mathematician,"
uMMQbcisins,32099,35719,"what we mean by algorithm is just any clear set of rules,"
uMMQbcisins,35720,37150,a procedure for doing something.
uMMQbcisins,37150,40380,The word comes from 9th century Baghdad
uMMQbcisins,40380,43650,"where Al-Khwarizmi, his name became algorithm,"
uMMQbcisins,43650,45670,but he also gave us the word that became algebra.
uMMQbcisins,45670,47739,He was just interested in building up the science
uMMQbcisins,47740,50350,of manipulating what we would think of as equations.
uMMQbcisins,50350,52460,"Usually, when people say algorithm,"
uMMQbcisins,52460,55180,"they mean something more computery, right?"
uMMQbcisins,55180,58440,"So usually, when we have a computer program,"
uMMQbcisins,58440,61280,we think of the underlying set of instructions
uMMQbcisins,61280,62180,"as an algorithm,"
uMMQbcisins,62180,64790,given some inputs it's gonna tell you kind of
uMMQbcisins,64790,66140,how to make a decision.
uMMQbcisins,66140,68210,If an algorithm is just like a precise procedure
uMMQbcisins,68210,69360,"for doing something,"
uMMQbcisins,69360,72560,then an example is a procedure that's so precise
uMMQbcisins,72560,73600,that a computer can do it.

uMMQbcisins,85510,88950,The math concept of zero is kind of the idea

uMMQbcisins,100990,102409,What makes it numbery?
uMMQbcisins,102410,104960,Math is decided kind of collectively.
uMMQbcisins,104960,107040,"Is that, it is useful to think about it as a number"
uMMQbcisins,107040,108630,because you can do arithmetic to it.
uMMQbcisins,108630,110200,So it deserves to be called a number.

uMMQbcisins,122960,125130,and you can definitely see that being abused.
uMMQbcisins,125130,127320,And this is true more and more

uMMQbcisins,135500,138450,I got obsessed with redistricting and gerrymandering

uMMQbcisins,143520,145300,"Ancient, ancient math was being used."

uMMQbcisins,149180,151230,that's very good for minorities.
uMMQbcisins,151230,153110,And now that's become much clearer
uMMQbcisins,153110,154710,because of these mathematical models.
uMMQbcisins,154710,156207,"And when you know that, you can fix it."
uMMQbcisins,156207,158650,And I think that's an example of math being used
uMMQbcisins,158650,160760,to kind of move the needle in a direction
uMMQbcisins,160760,161760,that's pretty good.

uMMQbcisins,624950,627860,Did we invent blockchain to like get money for ourselves?
uMMQbcisins,627860,629240,"No, we did not."
uMMQbcisins,629240,632810,"At ryleealanza, ""Is geometric group theory"
uMMQbcisins,632810,634570,"just anabelian topology?"""
uMMQbcisins,634570,638090,And then there's this like my absolute favorite part of this
uMMQbcisins,638090,640323,"is the laughing, crying emoji"
uMMQbcisins,640323,643330,because Rylee is just like cracking herself up here.
uMMQbcisins,643330,645450,"Or Rylee's, I think, really saying here"
uMMQbcisins,645450,648500,"has to do with just like, how much things commute, right?"
uMMQbcisins,648500,652580,"So you're used to ab equals ba, that's when things commute."
uMMQbcisins,652580,654910,And then you can sort of do math
uMMQbcisins,654910,656430,"where that's not true anymore,"
uMMQbcisins,656430,657640,"where like,"
uMMQbcisins,657640,662010,ab equals ba times a new thing called c.
uMMQbcisins,662010,663890,That's just not the math you learned in school.
uMMQbcisins,663890,665210,"Like, what is this new thing?"
uMMQbcisins,665210,666840,And how do you understand it?
uMMQbcisins,666840,671303,"Well, it turns out, this is the math of this model here."
uMMQbcisins,671303,672389,[chuckles]
uMMQbcisins,672390,676980,This is a model of what's called Nil or nilpotent geometry.
uMMQbcisins,676980,678560,"It's pretty cool, as I rotate it,"
uMMQbcisins,678560,681270,you can probably see that there's some complexity here
uMMQbcisins,681270,682900,"from some angles that looks one way,"
uMMQbcisins,682900,685070,from some angles you see different kinds of structure.
uMMQbcisins,685070,685940,This is my favorite.
uMMQbcisins,685940,687660,I love to think about this one.
uMMQbcisins,687660,690069,a and b are kind of moving horizontally
uMMQbcisins,690070,692500,and c is kind of moving up in this model.
uMMQbcisins,692500,693990,So that really shows you something
uMMQbcisins,693990,696870,about what Rylee's calling geometric group theory.
uMMQbcisins,696870,699560,You start with just like the group theory
uMMQbcisins,699560,702360,of how to multiply things and it builds geometry for you.
uMMQbcisins,702360,703760,- [Man] But is it hilarious?
uMMQbcisins,704710,705646,- No.
uMMQbcisins,705646,706630,[laughs]
uMMQbcisins,706630,708610,It's sort of stringing a bunch of words together
uMMQbcisins,708610,709910,and trying to make meaning out of them.
uMMQbcisins,709910,711350,And I think that's the joke here.
uMMQbcisins,711350,713470,"And like all jokes, when you try to explain it,"
uMMQbcisins,713470,715600,it sounds desperately unfunny.

uMMQbcisins,728200,731050,It's because over time those rules were developed
uMMQbcisins,731050,732420,and they produced a pretty good game.
uMMQbcisins,732420,734050,I could make about a chess game
uMMQbcisins,734050,736180,"where the bishops moved differently,"
uMMQbcisins,736180,737600,but then it would be my burden to show
uMMQbcisins,737600,738433,that it's a good game.
uMMQbcisins,738433,740209,We could do arithmetic differently.
uMMQbcisins,740210,741720,"And we do in math all the time,"
uMMQbcisins,741720,744810,we set up other number systems with other arithmetic.

uMMQbcisins,748560,750580,that you can build a good theory around them.
uMMQbcisins,750580,752880,And maybe that they're useful for modeling things
