m5FnWkSxNp8,3040,5359,we all love art and for me especially
m5FnWkSxNp8,5359,7600,dark and abstract pieces and these
m5FnWkSxNp8,7600,9440,beautiful pieces of art that i'm showing
m5FnWkSxNp8,9440,12160,you right now were all created by ai
m5FnWkSxNp8,12160,14080,none of those images were created by a
m5FnWkSxNp8,14080,16240,human they are ai generated artwork
m5FnWkSxNp8,16240,18320,based off of text prompts using
m5FnWkSxNp8,18320,19920,something called mid journey which is
m5FnWkSxNp8,19920,22080,software that allows you to imagine just
m5FnWkSxNp8,22080,24800,about anything and realize it into a
m5FnWkSxNp8,24800,26480,piece of art with beautiful colors
m5FnWkSxNp8,26480,28480,lighting and composition but let's go
m5FnWkSxNp8,28480,30320,back i just learned about this a few
m5FnWkSxNp8,30320,33360,weeks ago i was aware and tried some ai
m5FnWkSxNp8,33360,35200,art generators in the past but it was
m5FnWkSxNp8,35200,36719,always so limited and didn't have the
m5FnWkSxNp8,36719,38960,best results but then i started seeing
m5FnWkSxNp8,38960,41760,pieces from my friends olaf blumeris and
m5FnWkSxNp8,41760,44160,ryan booth and i had to dive in for
m5FnWkSxNp8,44160,46800,myself and getting in isn't easy you can
m5FnWkSxNp8,46800,48719,sign up for the beta but there's a hell
m5FnWkSxNp8,48719,50719,of a long wait list there but thankfully
m5FnWkSxNp8,50719,52719,i was hooked up by another friend quincy
m5FnWkSxNp8,52719,55199,ledbetter who is also a director and has
m5FnWkSxNp8,55199,56879,a feature film called elude the dreamer
m5FnWkSxNp8,56879,58160,which you should definitely check out
m5FnWkSxNp8,58160,59840,link in the notes below but he hooked me
m5FnWkSxNp8,59840,61600,up with an invite to the discord which
m5FnWkSxNp8,61600,63280,is where all of this goes through and
m5FnWkSxNp8,63280,64640,when you get in there there are
m5FnWkSxNp8,64640,66159,different channels people posting
m5FnWkSxNp8,66159,67920,prompts and receiving images all
m5FnWkSxNp8,67920,70960,together and it's free but chaos so i
m5FnWkSxNp8,70960,73119,typed forward slash subscribe and that
m5FnWkSxNp8,73119,75119,lets you get the paid subscription which
m5FnWkSxNp8,75119,78080,for me is worth it since you can then dm
m5FnWkSxNp8,78080,79920,the bot and have all of your stuff in
m5FnWkSxNp8,79920,82000,its own channel now it doesn't hide the
m5FnWkSxNp8,82000,84240,images that you create those still show
m5FnWkSxNp8,84240,85759,up in galleries but at least you aren't
m5FnWkSxNp8,85759,87680,dealing with the chaos of a million
m5FnWkSxNp8,87680,89840,images but now i can submit a prompt and
m5FnWkSxNp8,89840,91840,to do that i'll type forward slash
m5FnWkSxNp8,91840,94320,imagine and then whatever i want the ai
m5FnWkSxNp8,94320,96400,to create like a haunted house at night
m5FnWkSxNp8,96400,98880,in the style of a 1970s horror film you
m5FnWkSxNp8,98880,101040,can also control the aspect ratio by
m5FnWkSxNp8,101040,104159,typing dash dash ar then the ratio you
m5FnWkSxNp8,104159,107119,want like 16 9 or 9 16. then you hit
m5FnWkSxNp8,107119,109280,enter and it does its thing and brings
m5FnWkSxNp8,109280,111840,back four options from that prompt but
m5FnWkSxNp8,111840,114320,before we go on further let's back up
m5FnWkSxNp8,114320,116799,again how is this actually working
m5FnWkSxNp8,116799,119439,admittedly i'm no expert here but from
m5FnWkSxNp8,119439,122159,what i understand the system utilizes a
m5FnWkSxNp8,122159,124320,deep learning algorithm that has a
m5FnWkSxNp8,124320,126640,massive training set of images these are
m5FnWkSxNp8,126640,128720,images with text descriptions so the
m5FnWkSxNp8,128720,131039,system then finds variables that
m5FnWkSxNp8,131039,133599,familiarizes it with the translations of
m5FnWkSxNp8,133599,135680,the words to the pictures so when you
m5FnWkSxNp8,135680,137599,put in your prompt the system translates
m5FnWkSxNp8,137599,139360,that prompt and generates a picture
m5FnWkSxNp8,139360,141599,based off of what it has learned from
m5FnWkSxNp8,141599,143840,that massive data set which is a
m5FnWkSxNp8,143840,146879,massively over simplistic explanation
m5FnWkSxNp8,146879,148959,but the main thing i'm pointing out here
m5FnWkSxNp8,148959,151040,is that mid journey isn't taking images
m5FnWkSxNp8,151040,152640,that exist already and then morphing
m5FnWkSxNp8,152640,155519,them into something new remixing them it
m5FnWkSxNp8,155519,157440,is taking your prompt and creating
m5FnWkSxNp8,157440,160319,completely new art based off of that
m5FnWkSxNp8,160319,162400,massive data set it has learned from so
m5FnWkSxNp8,162400,163840,now we can add in our prompt and in
m5FnWkSxNp8,163840,165760,minutes we get back original artworks
m5FnWkSxNp8,165760,167920,which is insane and the results you get
m5FnWkSxNp8,167920,170160,are all about the prompts that you use
m5FnWkSxNp8,170160,172480,so say we want a horror vibe maybe a bus
m5FnWkSxNp8,172480,174879,stop at night i'll try forward slash
m5FnWkSxNp8,174879,177519,imagine bus stop at night horus style
m5FnWkSxNp8,177519,179599,and if i want it more cinematic i can
m5FnWkSxNp8,179599,182159,add that cinematic atmospheric shot on
m5FnWkSxNp8,182159,184560,film and the aspect ratio i want now i
m5FnWkSxNp8,184560,186080,get kicked back those four starter
m5FnWkSxNp8,186080,187920,images and now i have options on what i
m5FnWkSxNp8,187920,189200,want to do with them with these buttons
m5FnWkSxNp8,189200,191599,below u stands for upscale and the
m5FnWkSxNp8,191599,193920,number is the corresponding frame v is
m5FnWkSxNp8,193920,195760,to create another version of that
m5FnWkSxNp8,195760,197680,specific frame so you're iterating in
m5FnWkSxNp8,197680,199760,that direction and this button here does
m5FnWkSxNp8,199760,201519,an all new generation of the prompt
m5FnWkSxNp8,201519,203120,since as you see here if i type in the
m5FnWkSxNp8,203120,204799,exact same prompt i may get something
m5FnWkSxNp8,204799,206959,similar but i'll never get the exact
m5FnWkSxNp8,206959,208640,same thing i haven't been able to figure
m5FnWkSxNp8,208640,210560,out how much the order you put things in
m5FnWkSxNp8,210560,212959,actually matter since it changes each
m5FnWkSxNp8,212959,215200,time regardless but a part of the fun
m5FnWkSxNp8,215200,216959,here is trying different prompts in
m5FnWkSxNp8,216959,219040,different ways to land on what you're
m5FnWkSxNp8,219040,220560,setting out for and we can get more
m5FnWkSxNp8,220560,222799,specific by naming artists to land in
m5FnWkSxNp8,222799,225120,their specific style or things people
m5FnWkSxNp8,225120,227519,places like i could do a train station
m5FnWkSxNp8,227519,229360,at night filled with ghosts guimo del
m5FnWkSxNp8,229360,231680,toro movie cinematic hyper realistic
m5FnWkSxNp8,231680,234239,concept art and my aspect ratio and get
m5FnWkSxNp8,234239,236319,back something like this or we can mix
m5FnWkSxNp8,236319,238239,and match things like i posted to my
m5FnWkSxNp8,238239,240400,instagram a few days ago a xenomorph in
m5FnWkSxNp8,240400,242879,the style of pixar or we can go the
m5FnWkSxNp8,242879,245280,opposite direction and be obscured just
m5FnWkSxNp8,245280,247439,to see what mid journey translates like
m5FnWkSxNp8,247439,250799,avoid of insanity or hopeful horizon or
m5FnWkSxNp8,250799,252000,get crazy and try something like
m5FnWkSxNp8,252000,253760,nicholas cage riding a unicorn and once
m5FnWkSxNp8,253760,255439,you have those choices you can shift
m5FnWkSxNp8,255439,257680,your prompts or iterate off of those
m5FnWkSxNp8,257680,259440,images heading towards something you're
m5FnWkSxNp8,259440,261040,happy with and then we could just stare
m5FnWkSxNp8,261040,262400,at the one we like with appropriate
m5FnWkSxNp8,262400,264550,music
m5FnWkSxNp8,264550,267720,[Music]

m5FnWkSxNp8,330880,333600,this just in a mild inconvenience has
m5FnWkSxNp8,333600,336240,struck hollywood texas a mostly unknown
m5FnWkSxNp8,336240,338400,member of film riot known as josh conley
m5FnWkSxNp8,338400,341120,has due to its contagious nature become
m5FnWkSxNp8,341120,343039,a little
m5FnWkSxNp8,343039,345120,you know i expected this from ryan of
m5FnWkSxNp8,345120,348639,course but um but from josh
m5FnWkSxNp8,348639,351039,i also expected this because he is a
m5FnWkSxNp8,351039,354080,little josh connolly
m5FnWkSxNp8,354080,355680,i don't know who that is
m5FnWkSxNp8,355680,357600,oh i remember that guy
m5FnWkSxNp8,357600,359199,uh he's a little bit
m5FnWkSxNp8,359199,361280,other eyewitnesses reported confusion or
m5FnWkSxNp8,361280,362720,generally not giving
m5FnWkSxNp8,362720,364319,for more let's go live to justin
m5FnWkSxNp8,364319,367840,robinson in hollywood texas
m5FnWkSxNp8,369600,371360,i'm here at josh's office at triune
m5FnWkSxNp8,371360,373600,films but there's just one problem he's
m5FnWkSxNp8,373600,374720,not here
m5FnWkSxNp8,374720,375840,doctors broke the news to me this
m5FnWkSxNp8,375840,377600,morning that being a little is
m5FnWkSxNp8,377600,379759,highly contagious and he caught a severe
m5FnWkSxNp8,379759,380639,case
m5FnWkSxNp8,380639,382880,what's this mean for this week's episode
m5FnWkSxNp8,382880,383840,jack
m5FnWkSxNp8,383840,386160,for channel stfu news i'm justin
m5FnWkSxNp8,386160,389160,robinson
m5FnWkSxNp8,399120,401280,where was i
m5FnWkSxNp8,401280,403280,oh yes you could even do things like
m5FnWkSxNp8,403280,405280,action movie poster for a film called
m5FnWkSxNp8,405280,407840,die hard or your own custom movie poster
m5FnWkSxNp8,407840,409840,then just add descriptors in to adjust
m5FnWkSxNp8,409840,411520,the style to your liking like adding the
m5FnWkSxNp8,411520,413280,name of an artist sci-fi movie poster in
m5FnWkSxNp8,413280,415280,the style of drew strzane and we get
m5FnWkSxNp8,415280,417360,this or mystery thriller movie poster in
m5FnWkSxNp8,417360,420080,the style of saul bass and we have this
m5FnWkSxNp8,420080,421840,but again it's not art created by an
m5FnWkSxNp8,421840,423440,artist it's art that is being
m5FnWkSxNp8,423440,426560,interpreted by ai and i honestly am not
m5FnWkSxNp8,426560,428880,entirely sure how i feel about it just
m5FnWkSxNp8,428880,430960,yet it's also worth noting the terms of
m5FnWkSxNp8,430960,432880,use here everything you create through
m5FnWkSxNp8,432880,435360,mid-journey is owned by mid-journey then
m5FnWkSxNp8,435360,437120,you are free to use the images however
m5FnWkSxNp8,437120,438880,you want unless you're using them for a
m5FnWkSxNp8,438880,440240,company that makes more than a million
m5FnWkSxNp8,440240,442240,dollars in revenue a year then you need
m5FnWkSxNp8,442240,445199,to buy the 600 a year corporate plan or
m5FnWkSxNp8,445199,447520,if you use it on blockchain like selling
m5FnWkSxNp8,447520,449759,an nft you'll need to pay 20 in
m5FnWkSxNp8,449759,452800,royalties on anything over 20 000
m5FnWkSxNp8,452800,455199,a month in revenue which all of that is
m5FnWkSxNp8,455199,457199,more than reasonable in my book since
m5FnWkSxNp8,457199,459440,again you aren't making this art their
m5FnWkSxNp8,459440,461919,ai is but that point of not owning the
m5FnWkSxNp8,461919,463360,art is a big one for me it's
m5FnWkSxNp8,463360,465919,understandable given what it is but that
m5FnWkSxNp8,465919,468240,does limit how i would want to use it so
m5FnWkSxNp8,468240,470160,how am i using it so far what is
m5FnWkSxNp8,470160,471680,exciting me the most about this is
m5FnWkSxNp8,471680,473759,leveraging it for inspiration and for
m5FnWkSxNp8,473759,475919,assets when pitching my films i've been
m5FnWkSxNp8,475919,478080,able to create a lot of art that nails
m5FnWkSxNp8,478080,480319,the tone and in some cases design of
m5FnWkSxNp8,480319,482560,what i'm trying to pitch before i was
m5FnWkSxNp8,482560,484560,just finding what i could online
m5FnWkSxNp8,484560,487599,photoshopping things and so on but now i
m5FnWkSxNp8,487599,489360,can get more specific and make things
m5FnWkSxNp8,489360,491199,that didn't exist then on the
m5FnWkSxNp8,491199,493199,inspiration side it's been fun to
m5FnWkSxNp8,493199,495520,iterate and try things to see where one
m5FnWkSxNp8,495520,497599,thought will lead i've already come up
m5FnWkSxNp8,497599,499280,with a new feature concept that i'm
m5FnWkSxNp8,499280,501599,building out thanks to this process but
m5FnWkSxNp8,501599,503919,is this real art a lot of the pieces
m5FnWkSxNp8,503919,506000,that i made i would legitimately hang on
m5FnWkSxNp8,506000,508400,my wall and some prompts have landed
m5FnWkSxNp8,508400,510240,directly on the look and feel i was
m5FnWkSxNp8,510240,513039,after i mean everything we make normally
m5FnWkSxNp8,513039,515200,is a translation of what we see and
m5FnWkSxNp8,515200,517360,experience as humans and with the right
m5FnWkSxNp8,517360,519039,prompts you can elicit the right
m5FnWkSxNp8,519039,521440,translation from ai it's really like
m5FnWkSxNp8,521440,523599,directing when you direct a film you
m5FnWkSxNp8,523599,525360,don't light it you don't act it but you
m5FnWkSxNp8,525360,528000,prompt your creatives in a direction so
m5FnWkSxNp8,528000,529760,that they can interpret and return a
m5FnWkSxNp8,529760,532160,translation of the emotion you want to
m5FnWkSxNp8,532160,534480,paint however those are actual humans
m5FnWkSxNp8,534480,536880,that are translating humanity i can give
m5FnWkSxNp8,536880,539360,my new details to an actual artist and
m5FnWkSxNp8,539360,542560,get their proper nuanced results for me
m5FnWkSxNp8,542560,545360,true art is made of emotional experience
m5FnWkSxNp8,545360,547360,not just the interpretation of viewed
m5FnWkSxNp8,547360,550000,experience so there is a hollowness to
m5FnWkSxNp8,550000,552320,this for me it's missing the specificity
m5FnWkSxNp8,552320,554880,of human decision making but maybe it's
m5FnWkSxNp8,554880,556959,just because it's new to me either way
m5FnWkSxNp8,556959,559120,it's a great starter on the norm we
m5FnWkSxNp8,559120,560560,don't have the budget to get proper
m5FnWkSxNp8,560560,562880,artists to be toying around on basic
m5FnWkSxNp8,562880,564800,concept stuff in the beginning but if
m5FnWkSxNp8,564800,567040,you are going to stay somewhat abstract
m5FnWkSxNp8,567040,569839,and concept-based this is pretty nuts
m5FnWkSxNp8,569839,571839,and useful but eventually i would want
m5FnWkSxNp8,571839,574320,to take this out to an actual artist use
m5FnWkSxNp8,574320,577200,it as an idea starter and then get human
m5FnWkSxNp8,577200,579200,hands on it to build it from there but
m5FnWkSxNp8,579200,581200,what do you think is this exciting scary
m5FnWkSxNp8,581200,583360,something else entirely one thing is for
m5FnWkSxNp8,583360,585200,sure this is just the beginning i can
m5FnWkSxNp8,585200,587200,only imagine how advanced this is going
m5FnWkSxNp8,587200,588959,to be in just a couple more years and
m5FnWkSxNp8,588959,591040,how this sort of thing will branch out
m5FnWkSxNp8,591040,593519,to all aspects of our industry but like
m5FnWkSxNp8,593519,595920,i said before getting in mid journey is
m5FnWkSxNp8,595920,597600,crazy hard you really just need an
m5FnWkSxNp8,597600,599680,invite from somebody who's already in it
m5FnWkSxNp8,599680,601760,and we do have one more to give out
m5FnWkSxNp8,601760,603440,we'll pick one person who comments on
m5FnWkSxNp8,603440,605440,this episode so hit us up with a comment
m5FnWkSxNp8,605440,607360,below and we'll pick someone at random
m5FnWkSxNp8,607360,608800,in the next few days but that's it for
m5FnWkSxNp8,608800,610160,today as always if you're not subscribed
m5FnWkSxNp8,610160,611600,consider doing that and hit the bell to
m5FnWkSxNp8,611600,613440,be notified when we put up more content
m5FnWkSxNp8,613440,614640,and until next time don't forget to
m5FnWkSxNp8,614640,617540,write shoot edit repeat
m5FnWkSxNp8,617540,621428,[Music]
m5FnWkSxNp8,630630,633940,[Music]
m5FnWkSxNp8,635279,637360,you
vid,start,end,text
m5FnWkSxNp8,3040,5359,we all love art and for me especially
m5FnWkSxNp8,5359,7600,dark and abstract pieces and these
m5FnWkSxNp8,7600,9440,beautiful pieces of art that i'm showing
m5FnWkSxNp8,9440,12160,you right now were all created by ai
m5FnWkSxNp8,12160,14080,none of those images were created by a
m5FnWkSxNp8,14080,16240,human they are ai generated artwork
m5FnWkSxNp8,16240,18320,based off of text prompts using
m5FnWkSxNp8,18320,19920,something called mid journey which is
m5FnWkSxNp8,19920,22080,software that allows you to imagine just
m5FnWkSxNp8,22080,24800,about anything and realize it into a
m5FnWkSxNp8,24800,26480,piece of art with beautiful colors
m5FnWkSxNp8,26480,28480,lighting and composition but let's go
m5FnWkSxNp8,28480,30320,back i just learned about this a few
m5FnWkSxNp8,30320,33360,weeks ago i was aware and tried some ai
m5FnWkSxNp8,33360,35200,art generators in the past but it was
m5FnWkSxNp8,35200,36719,always so limited and didn't have the
m5FnWkSxNp8,36719,38960,best results but then i started seeing
m5FnWkSxNp8,38960,41760,pieces from my friends olaf blumeris and
m5FnWkSxNp8,41760,44160,ryan booth and i had to dive in for
m5FnWkSxNp8,44160,46800,myself and getting in isn't easy you can
m5FnWkSxNp8,46800,48719,sign up for the beta but there's a hell
m5FnWkSxNp8,48719,50719,of a long wait list there but thankfully
m5FnWkSxNp8,50719,52719,i was hooked up by another friend quincy
m5FnWkSxNp8,52719,55199,ledbetter who is also a director and has
m5FnWkSxNp8,55199,56879,a feature film called elude the dreamer
m5FnWkSxNp8,56879,58160,which you should definitely check out
m5FnWkSxNp8,58160,59840,link in the notes below but he hooked me
m5FnWkSxNp8,59840,61600,up with an invite to the discord which
m5FnWkSxNp8,61600,63280,is where all of this goes through and
m5FnWkSxNp8,63280,64640,when you get in there there are
m5FnWkSxNp8,64640,66159,different channels people posting
m5FnWkSxNp8,66159,67920,prompts and receiving images all
m5FnWkSxNp8,67920,70960,together and it's free but chaos so i
m5FnWkSxNp8,70960,73119,typed forward slash subscribe and that
m5FnWkSxNp8,73119,75119,lets you get the paid subscription which
m5FnWkSxNp8,75119,78080,for me is worth it since you can then dm
m5FnWkSxNp8,78080,79920,the bot and have all of your stuff in
m5FnWkSxNp8,79920,82000,its own channel now it doesn't hide the
m5FnWkSxNp8,82000,84240,images that you create those still show
m5FnWkSxNp8,84240,85759,up in galleries but at least you aren't
m5FnWkSxNp8,85759,87680,dealing with the chaos of a million
m5FnWkSxNp8,87680,89840,images but now i can submit a prompt and
m5FnWkSxNp8,89840,91840,to do that i'll type forward slash
m5FnWkSxNp8,91840,94320,imagine and then whatever i want the ai
m5FnWkSxNp8,94320,96400,to create like a haunted house at night
m5FnWkSxNp8,96400,98880,in the style of a 1970s horror film you
m5FnWkSxNp8,98880,101040,can also control the aspect ratio by
m5FnWkSxNp8,101040,104159,typing dash dash ar then the ratio you
m5FnWkSxNp8,104159,107119,want like 16 9 or 9 16. then you hit
m5FnWkSxNp8,107119,109280,enter and it does its thing and brings
m5FnWkSxNp8,109280,111840,back four options from that prompt but
m5FnWkSxNp8,111840,114320,before we go on further let's back up
m5FnWkSxNp8,114320,116799,again how is this actually working
m5FnWkSxNp8,116799,119439,admittedly i'm no expert here but from
m5FnWkSxNp8,119439,122159,what i understand the system utilizes a
m5FnWkSxNp8,122159,124320,deep learning algorithm that has a
m5FnWkSxNp8,124320,126640,massive training set of images these are
m5FnWkSxNp8,126640,128720,images with text descriptions so the
m5FnWkSxNp8,128720,131039,system then finds variables that
m5FnWkSxNp8,131039,133599,familiarizes it with the translations of
m5FnWkSxNp8,133599,135680,the words to the pictures so when you
m5FnWkSxNp8,135680,137599,put in your prompt the system translates
m5FnWkSxNp8,137599,139360,that prompt and generates a picture
m5FnWkSxNp8,139360,141599,based off of what it has learned from
m5FnWkSxNp8,141599,143840,that massive data set which is a
m5FnWkSxNp8,143840,146879,massively over simplistic explanation
m5FnWkSxNp8,146879,148959,but the main thing i'm pointing out here
m5FnWkSxNp8,148959,151040,is that mid journey isn't taking images
m5FnWkSxNp8,151040,152640,that exist already and then morphing
m5FnWkSxNp8,152640,155519,them into something new remixing them it
m5FnWkSxNp8,155519,157440,is taking your prompt and creating
m5FnWkSxNp8,157440,160319,completely new art based off of that
m5FnWkSxNp8,160319,162400,massive data set it has learned from so
m5FnWkSxNp8,162400,163840,now we can add in our prompt and in
m5FnWkSxNp8,163840,165760,minutes we get back original artworks
m5FnWkSxNp8,165760,167920,which is insane and the results you get
m5FnWkSxNp8,167920,170160,are all about the prompts that you use
m5FnWkSxNp8,170160,172480,so say we want a horror vibe maybe a bus
m5FnWkSxNp8,172480,174879,stop at night i'll try forward slash
m5FnWkSxNp8,174879,177519,imagine bus stop at night horus style
m5FnWkSxNp8,177519,179599,and if i want it more cinematic i can
m5FnWkSxNp8,179599,182159,add that cinematic atmospheric shot on
m5FnWkSxNp8,182159,184560,film and the aspect ratio i want now i
m5FnWkSxNp8,184560,186080,get kicked back those four starter
m5FnWkSxNp8,186080,187920,images and now i have options on what i
m5FnWkSxNp8,187920,189200,want to do with them with these buttons
m5FnWkSxNp8,189200,191599,below u stands for upscale and the
m5FnWkSxNp8,191599,193920,number is the corresponding frame v is
m5FnWkSxNp8,193920,195760,to create another version of that
m5FnWkSxNp8,195760,197680,specific frame so you're iterating in
m5FnWkSxNp8,197680,199760,that direction and this button here does
m5FnWkSxNp8,199760,201519,an all new generation of the prompt
m5FnWkSxNp8,201519,203120,since as you see here if i type in the
m5FnWkSxNp8,203120,204799,exact same prompt i may get something
m5FnWkSxNp8,204799,206959,similar but i'll never get the exact
m5FnWkSxNp8,206959,208640,same thing i haven't been able to figure
m5FnWkSxNp8,208640,210560,out how much the order you put things in
m5FnWkSxNp8,210560,212959,actually matter since it changes each
m5FnWkSxNp8,212959,215200,time regardless but a part of the fun
m5FnWkSxNp8,215200,216959,here is trying different prompts in
m5FnWkSxNp8,216959,219040,different ways to land on what you're
m5FnWkSxNp8,219040,220560,setting out for and we can get more
m5FnWkSxNp8,220560,222799,specific by naming artists to land in
m5FnWkSxNp8,222799,225120,their specific style or things people
m5FnWkSxNp8,225120,227519,places like i could do a train station
m5FnWkSxNp8,227519,229360,at night filled with ghosts guimo del
m5FnWkSxNp8,229360,231680,toro movie cinematic hyper realistic
m5FnWkSxNp8,231680,234239,concept art and my aspect ratio and get
m5FnWkSxNp8,234239,236319,back something like this or we can mix
m5FnWkSxNp8,236319,238239,and match things like i posted to my
m5FnWkSxNp8,238239,240400,instagram a few days ago a xenomorph in
m5FnWkSxNp8,240400,242879,the style of pixar or we can go the
m5FnWkSxNp8,242879,245280,opposite direction and be obscured just
m5FnWkSxNp8,245280,247439,to see what mid journey translates like
m5FnWkSxNp8,247439,250799,avoid of insanity or hopeful horizon or
m5FnWkSxNp8,250799,252000,get crazy and try something like
m5FnWkSxNp8,252000,253760,nicholas cage riding a unicorn and once
m5FnWkSxNp8,253760,255439,you have those choices you can shift
m5FnWkSxNp8,255439,257680,your prompts or iterate off of those
m5FnWkSxNp8,257680,259440,images heading towards something you're
m5FnWkSxNp8,259440,261040,happy with and then we could just stare
m5FnWkSxNp8,261040,262400,at the one we like with appropriate

m5FnWkSxNp8,330880,333600,this just in a mild inconvenience has
m5FnWkSxNp8,333600,336240,struck hollywood texas a mostly unknown
m5FnWkSxNp8,336240,338400,member of film riot known as josh conley
m5FnWkSxNp8,338400,341120,has due to its contagious nature become
m5FnWkSxNp8,341120,343039,a little
m5FnWkSxNp8,343039,345120,you know i expected this from ryan of
m5FnWkSxNp8,345120,348639,course but um but from josh
m5FnWkSxNp8,348639,351039,i also expected this because he is a
m5FnWkSxNp8,351039,354080,little josh connolly
m5FnWkSxNp8,354080,355680,i don't know who that is
m5FnWkSxNp8,355680,357600,oh i remember that guy
m5FnWkSxNp8,357600,359199,uh he's a little bit
m5FnWkSxNp8,359199,361280,other eyewitnesses reported confusion or
m5FnWkSxNp8,361280,362720,generally not giving
m5FnWkSxNp8,362720,364319,for more let's go live to justin
m5FnWkSxNp8,364319,367840,robinson in hollywood texas
m5FnWkSxNp8,369600,371360,i'm here at josh's office at triune
m5FnWkSxNp8,371360,373600,films but there's just one problem he's
m5FnWkSxNp8,373600,374720,not here
m5FnWkSxNp8,374720,375840,doctors broke the news to me this
m5FnWkSxNp8,375840,377600,morning that being a little is
m5FnWkSxNp8,377600,379759,highly contagious and he caught a severe
m5FnWkSxNp8,379759,380639,case
m5FnWkSxNp8,380639,382880,what's this mean for this week's episode
m5FnWkSxNp8,382880,383840,jack
m5FnWkSxNp8,383840,386160,for channel stfu news i'm justin
m5FnWkSxNp8,386160,389160,robinson
m5FnWkSxNp8,399120,401280,where was i
m5FnWkSxNp8,401280,403280,oh yes you could even do things like
m5FnWkSxNp8,403280,405280,action movie poster for a film called
m5FnWkSxNp8,405280,407840,die hard or your own custom movie poster
m5FnWkSxNp8,407840,409840,then just add descriptors in to adjust
m5FnWkSxNp8,409840,411520,the style to your liking like adding the
m5FnWkSxNp8,411520,413280,name of an artist sci-fi movie poster in
m5FnWkSxNp8,413280,415280,the style of drew strzane and we get
m5FnWkSxNp8,415280,417360,this or mystery thriller movie poster in
m5FnWkSxNp8,417360,420080,the style of saul bass and we have this
m5FnWkSxNp8,420080,421840,but again it's not art created by an
m5FnWkSxNp8,421840,423440,artist it's art that is being
m5FnWkSxNp8,423440,426560,interpreted by ai and i honestly am not
m5FnWkSxNp8,426560,428880,entirely sure how i feel about it just
m5FnWkSxNp8,428880,430960,yet it's also worth noting the terms of
m5FnWkSxNp8,430960,432880,use here everything you create through
m5FnWkSxNp8,432880,435360,mid-journey is owned by mid-journey then
m5FnWkSxNp8,435360,437120,you are free to use the images however
m5FnWkSxNp8,437120,438880,you want unless you're using them for a
m5FnWkSxNp8,438880,440240,company that makes more than a million
m5FnWkSxNp8,440240,442240,dollars in revenue a year then you need
m5FnWkSxNp8,442240,445199,to buy the 600 a year corporate plan or
m5FnWkSxNp8,445199,447520,if you use it on blockchain like selling
m5FnWkSxNp8,447520,449759,an nft you'll need to pay 20 in
m5FnWkSxNp8,449759,452800,royalties on anything over 20 000
m5FnWkSxNp8,452800,455199,a month in revenue which all of that is
m5FnWkSxNp8,455199,457199,more than reasonable in my book since
m5FnWkSxNp8,457199,459440,again you aren't making this art their
m5FnWkSxNp8,459440,461919,ai is but that point of not owning the
m5FnWkSxNp8,461919,463360,art is a big one for me it's
m5FnWkSxNp8,463360,465919,understandable given what it is but that
m5FnWkSxNp8,465919,468240,does limit how i would want to use it so
m5FnWkSxNp8,468240,470160,how am i using it so far what is
m5FnWkSxNp8,470160,471680,exciting me the most about this is
m5FnWkSxNp8,471680,473759,leveraging it for inspiration and for
m5FnWkSxNp8,473759,475919,assets when pitching my films i've been
m5FnWkSxNp8,475919,478080,able to create a lot of art that nails
m5FnWkSxNp8,478080,480319,the tone and in some cases design of
m5FnWkSxNp8,480319,482560,what i'm trying to pitch before i was
m5FnWkSxNp8,482560,484560,just finding what i could online
m5FnWkSxNp8,484560,487599,photoshopping things and so on but now i
m5FnWkSxNp8,487599,489360,can get more specific and make things
m5FnWkSxNp8,489360,491199,that didn't exist then on the
m5FnWkSxNp8,491199,493199,inspiration side it's been fun to
m5FnWkSxNp8,493199,495520,iterate and try things to see where one
m5FnWkSxNp8,495520,497599,thought will lead i've already come up
m5FnWkSxNp8,497599,499280,with a new feature concept that i'm
m5FnWkSxNp8,499280,501599,building out thanks to this process but
m5FnWkSxNp8,501599,503919,is this real art a lot of the pieces
m5FnWkSxNp8,503919,506000,that i made i would legitimately hang on
m5FnWkSxNp8,506000,508400,my wall and some prompts have landed
m5FnWkSxNp8,508400,510240,directly on the look and feel i was
m5FnWkSxNp8,510240,513039,after i mean everything we make normally
m5FnWkSxNp8,513039,515200,is a translation of what we see and
m5FnWkSxNp8,515200,517360,experience as humans and with the right
m5FnWkSxNp8,517360,519039,prompts you can elicit the right
m5FnWkSxNp8,519039,521440,translation from ai it's really like
m5FnWkSxNp8,521440,523599,directing when you direct a film you
m5FnWkSxNp8,523599,525360,don't light it you don't act it but you
m5FnWkSxNp8,525360,528000,prompt your creatives in a direction so
m5FnWkSxNp8,528000,529760,that they can interpret and return a
m5FnWkSxNp8,529760,532160,translation of the emotion you want to
m5FnWkSxNp8,532160,534480,paint however those are actual humans
m5FnWkSxNp8,534480,536880,that are translating humanity i can give
m5FnWkSxNp8,536880,539360,my new details to an actual artist and
m5FnWkSxNp8,539360,542560,get their proper nuanced results for me
m5FnWkSxNp8,542560,545360,true art is made of emotional experience
m5FnWkSxNp8,545360,547360,not just the interpretation of viewed
m5FnWkSxNp8,547360,550000,experience so there is a hollowness to
m5FnWkSxNp8,550000,552320,this for me it's missing the specificity
m5FnWkSxNp8,552320,554880,of human decision making but maybe it's
m5FnWkSxNp8,554880,556959,just because it's new to me either way
m5FnWkSxNp8,556959,559120,it's a great starter on the norm we
m5FnWkSxNp8,559120,560560,don't have the budget to get proper
m5FnWkSxNp8,560560,562880,artists to be toying around on basic
m5FnWkSxNp8,562880,564800,concept stuff in the beginning but if
m5FnWkSxNp8,564800,567040,you are going to stay somewhat abstract
m5FnWkSxNp8,567040,569839,and concept-based this is pretty nuts
m5FnWkSxNp8,569839,571839,and useful but eventually i would want
m5FnWkSxNp8,571839,574320,to take this out to an actual artist use
m5FnWkSxNp8,574320,577200,it as an idea starter and then get human
m5FnWkSxNp8,577200,579200,hands on it to build it from there but
m5FnWkSxNp8,579200,581200,what do you think is this exciting scary
m5FnWkSxNp8,581200,583360,something else entirely one thing is for
m5FnWkSxNp8,583360,585200,sure this is just the beginning i can
m5FnWkSxNp8,585200,587200,only imagine how advanced this is going
m5FnWkSxNp8,587200,588959,to be in just a couple more years and
m5FnWkSxNp8,588959,591040,how this sort of thing will branch out
m5FnWkSxNp8,591040,593519,to all aspects of our industry but like
m5FnWkSxNp8,593519,595920,i said before getting in mid journey is
m5FnWkSxNp8,595920,597600,crazy hard you really just need an
m5FnWkSxNp8,597600,599680,invite from somebody who's already in it
m5FnWkSxNp8,599680,601760,and we do have one more to give out
m5FnWkSxNp8,601760,603440,we'll pick one person who comments on
m5FnWkSxNp8,603440,605440,this episode so hit us up with a comment
m5FnWkSxNp8,605440,607360,below and we'll pick someone at random
m5FnWkSxNp8,607360,608800,in the next few days but that's it for
m5FnWkSxNp8,608800,610160,today as always if you're not subscribed
m5FnWkSxNp8,610160,611600,consider doing that and hit the bell to
m5FnWkSxNp8,611600,613440,be notified when we put up more content
m5FnWkSxNp8,613440,614640,and until next time don't forget to
