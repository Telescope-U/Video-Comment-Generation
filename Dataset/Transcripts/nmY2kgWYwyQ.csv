nmY2kgWYwyQ,240,2080,i'm about to spend ten thousand dollars
nmY2kgWYwyQ,2080,4160,in the next 200 seconds ordering the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,4160,6799,most impossibly thin tech on the entire
nmY2kgWYwyQ,6799,7919,planet
nmY2kgWYwyQ,7919,11360,okay i mean how thin do cameras get well
nmY2kgWYwyQ,11360,13920,it's definitely not you wait a paper
nmY2kgWYwyQ,13920,17520,camera what this is gonna be saucy okay
nmY2kgWYwyQ,17520,20240,uh thinnest tablet in the world the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,20240,24160,remarkable two it's only 299.
nmY2kgWYwyQ,24160,26800,okay 399 when you don't get their
nmY2kgWYwyQ,26800,28400,subscription no i just said i didn't
nmY2kgWYwyQ,28400,30560,want the subscription
nmY2kgWYwyQ,30560,32960,yes i'm sure okay you have to buy the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,32960,36800,pen separately 129. the the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,36800,40719,cover is 119. oh you cheeky little did
nmY2kgWYwyQ,40719,43280,that actually just become 700. i feel
nmY2kgWYwyQ,43280,45840,like i've just been robbed anyways
nmY2kgWYwyQ,45840,47680,let's find a charger for it well would
nmY2kgWYwyQ,47680,49840,you look at that the size of a credit
nmY2kgWYwyQ,49840,50800,card
nmY2kgWYwyQ,50800,53840,you will do just fine hmm slimmest
nmY2kgWYwyQ,53840,55840,earphones in the world the slimmest
nmY2kgWYwyQ,55840,57760,printer in the world so one of the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,57760,59039,things that i normally try and do when
nmY2kgWYwyQ,59039,60719,i'm ordering stuff is to see if i can
nmY2kgWYwyQ,60719,63520,build a computer setup in the theme of
nmY2kgWYwyQ,63520,64720,that video
nmY2kgWYwyQ,64720,65518,so
nmY2kgWYwyQ,65518,68159,world's thinnest mouse
nmY2kgWYwyQ,68159,68960,check
nmY2kgWYwyQ,68960,71280,we've got a mouse mat fractions of a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,71280,73280,millimeter thick
nmY2kgWYwyQ,73280,76240,check what about the keyboard though
nmY2kgWYwyQ,76240,77759,it's pretty thin
nmY2kgWYwyQ,77759,79920,i'm sure we can do better though oh
nmY2kgWYwyQ,79920,83280,logitech that's very thin it's just it's
nmY2kgWYwyQ,83280,85040,just the keys if only you could have a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,85040,87439,keyboard without the key sticking out
nmY2kgWYwyQ,87439,88240,okay
nmY2kgWYwyQ,88240,89360,um
nmY2kgWYwyQ,89360,91119,that's probably going to do the job this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,91119,94079,is a keyboard made completely of glass
nmY2kgWYwyQ,94079,96880,but of course for a computer setup we
nmY2kgWYwyQ,96880,99280,need a computer so we could get like a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,99280,102000,really high-end gaming pc but built into
nmY2kgWYwyQ,102000,104720,a really thin case like this um
nmY2kgWYwyQ,104720,106479,well this is the coolest pc case i've
nmY2kgWYwyQ,106479,108479,ever seen in my life we could get one of
nmY2kgWYwyQ,108479,111600,those really mini pcs um
nmY2kgWYwyQ,111600,114320,no no okay this has got to be special
nmY2kgWYwyQ,114320,116560,let's get something custom made this is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,116560,118000,not gonna be cheap
nmY2kgWYwyQ,118000,120000,speaking of computers though i've wanted
nmY2kgWYwyQ,120000,122240,a good windows laptop for a really long
nmY2kgWYwyQ,122240,124159,time now let's see
nmY2kgWYwyQ,124159,127680,dell xps 15 which is 17 millimeters
nmY2kgWYwyQ,127680,130800,thick that's less than two centimeters
nmY2kgWYwyQ,130800,132800,there's the razor book which is actually
nmY2kgWYwyQ,132800,135680,15 millimeters i think we got our answer
nmY2kgWYwyQ,135680,138400,the acer swift 7 is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,138400,140879,9.95 millimeters thick
nmY2kgWYwyQ,140879,144879,less than a centimeter oh my god i'm
nmY2kgWYwyQ,144879,146959,looking at the thinnest screen i've ever
nmY2kgWYwyQ,146959,148640,seen i'm just gonna buy it i'm not even
nmY2kgWYwyQ,148640,150239,gonna show you yet this is gonna be
nmY2kgWYwyQ,150239,152319,worth the wait okay what kind of stuff
nmY2kgWYwyQ,152319,154640,do i just wish was thinner
nmY2kgWYwyQ,154640,156800,a suitcase
nmY2kgWYwyQ,156800,159920,why not the narrowest sunglasses ever
nmY2kgWYwyQ,159920,162160,the skinniest wallet ever
nmY2kgWYwyQ,162160,164400,i'm so confused like how does that even
nmY2kgWYwyQ,164400,166640,hold anything and then finally to finish
nmY2kgWYwyQ,166640,168319,off the budget i want to see if we can
nmY2kgWYwyQ,168319,170160,find a speaker now this might be a bit
nmY2kgWYwyQ,170160,171760,of a challenge because you'd normally
nmY2kgWYwyQ,171760,173760,need to make speakers chunky so that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,173760,174879,they can get enough bikes i like the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,174879,178000,battery bike wait that's a speaker
nmY2kgWYwyQ,178000,180640,ah it's not for sale
nmY2kgWYwyQ,180640,183360,how convenient so i think this is the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,183360,185200,slimmest speaker that you can buy it's
nmY2kgWYwyQ,185200,187360,apparently as thin as your phone and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,187360,189680,this is even thinner because it's not
nmY2kgWYwyQ,189680,191599,actually a speaker in itself but it can
nmY2kgWYwyQ,191599,193760,turn anything you stick it onto
nmY2kgWYwyQ,193760,195760,into a speaker okay someone take this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,195760,197920,laptop away from me right two months
nmY2kgWYwyQ,197920,200159,later and it's time to unbox it all so
nmY2kgWYwyQ,200159,202000,let's start thin and just keep getting
nmY2kgWYwyQ,202000,203360,thinner i mean all you've got to do is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,203360,205120,to look at this packaging to realize
nmY2kgWYwyQ,205120,207360,just how thin things are going to get
nmY2kgWYwyQ,207360,209599,okay so starting at nine centimeters you
nmY2kgWYwyQ,209599,212560,know that custom pc i was talking about
nmY2kgWYwyQ,212560,214319,we got it
nmY2kgWYwyQ,214319,215599,and you're actually looking at it right
nmY2kgWYwyQ,215599,217440,now so basically i found this company
nmY2kgWYwyQ,217440,218959,called novatech and they have a sub
nmY2kgWYwyQ,218959,221040,brand called rain gaming which has some
nmY2kgWYwyQ,221040,223440,of the coolest custom pcs i've ever seen
nmY2kgWYwyQ,223440,224879,so i told them i'm looking for the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,224879,227280,thinnest extreme pc on the market and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,227280,228640,from there we came up with the idea of
nmY2kgWYwyQ,228640,231519,building it into my desk now i'll admit
nmY2kgWYwyQ,231519,233599,this is still not the most razor thin pc
nmY2kgWYwyQ,233599,235120,you've ever seen we could have made it
nmY2kgWYwyQ,235120,236959,thinner but
nmY2kgWYwyQ,236959,238720,wait till you see what it can do i mean
nmY2kgWYwyQ,238720,240799,just for starters mechanical legs so
nmY2kgWYwyQ,240799,242319,with one tap of a button this can go
nmY2kgWYwyQ,242319,245360,from below my waist to above my head mr
nmY2kgWYwyQ,245360,247120,who's the boss themed colors across all
nmY2kgWYwyQ,247120,249360,cabling and lighting electrochromic
nmY2kgWYwyQ,249360,250799,glass such that if all that color
nmY2kgWYwyQ,250799,252879,becomes a distraction i can just tap one
nmY2kgWYwyQ,252879,255120,button and bam it'll pass a specialized
nmY2kgWYwyQ,255120,256639,current through it which changes the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,256639,258479,chemical arrangement of that glass to
nmY2kgWYwyQ,258479,261680,make it opaque but on top of all of that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,261680,264720,power we're talking a 12th gen intel i7
nmY2kgWYwyQ,264720,268160,12700 kf processor nvidia geforce rdx
nmY2kgWYwyQ,268160,272080,3080 ti graphics card and wd black sm850
nmY2kgWYwyQ,272080,274400,storage which is so fast it can copy an
nmY2kgWYwyQ,274400,276800,entire one terabyte hard drive across in
nmY2kgWYwyQ,276800,278960,just three minutes we'll keep adding
nmY2kgWYwyQ,278960,281040,things to this pc setup as we go through
nmY2kgWYwyQ,281040,282880,the video and unbox thinner and thinner
nmY2kgWYwyQ,282880,284000,devices
nmY2kgWYwyQ,284000,285680,okay dropping all the way down to just
nmY2kgWYwyQ,285680,288160,five centimeters we have a rolling
nmY2kgWYwyQ,288160,290320,suitcase and you're probably thinking
nmY2kgWYwyQ,290320,292720,five centimeters i couldn't even fit my
nmY2kgWYwyQ,292720,295360,underwear in that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,295360,296880,but
nmY2kgWYwyQ,296880,298560,it expands
nmY2kgWYwyQ,298560,302960,it seems like a very solid piece of kit
nmY2kgWYwyQ,305120,306880,this feels wrong
nmY2kgWYwyQ,306880,309520,it's not a suitcase surely
nmY2kgWYwyQ,309520,311520,i love the concept of this it only ever
nmY2kgWYwyQ,311520,314000,takes up as much space as it needs to
nmY2kgWYwyQ,314000,316400,now at half the thickness of even that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,316400,317759,we're only three products in and already
nmY2kgWYwyQ,317759,321919,reaching 2.5 centimeters hp's sprocket
nmY2kgWYwyQ,321919,326160,this is a printer that's just ridiculous
nmY2kgWYwyQ,326160,327840,so in theory i should just be able to
nmY2kgWYwyQ,327840,330160,pull up a photo on my phone oh
nmY2kgWYwyQ,330160,332639,something's happening it's really fast
nmY2kgWYwyQ,332639,334160,and the picture goes right up to the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,334160,336880,edges i'm quite impressed pretty high
nmY2kgWYwyQ,336880,340160,resolution but if you think that's thin
nmY2kgWYwyQ,340160,342000,okay just for perspective here's a pair
nmY2kgWYwyQ,342000,344080,of apple airpods pretty thin credit
nmY2kgWYwyQ,344080,346320,where do but nothing compared to this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,346320,349199,monstrosity inside this pack should be
nmY2kgWYwyQ,349199,353039,the yobyo card 20 earphones
nmY2kgWYwyQ,353039,355120,oh look what
nmY2kgWYwyQ,355120,356880,they're called card because they're so
nmY2kgWYwyQ,356880,358400,slim that it's it's not just that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,358400,360080,they'll fit in your pocket these could
nmY2kgWYwyQ,360080,361680,fit in your wallet
nmY2kgWYwyQ,361680,363199,i wonder if they've just given them like
nmY2kgWYwyQ,363199,364800,no battery life
nmY2kgWYwyQ,364800,366720,now i honestly have zero idea what to
nmY2kgWYwyQ,366720,368800,expect from this one it genuinely looks
nmY2kgWYwyQ,368800,370560,like someone's taken a proper camera and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,370560,372639,then just sat on it repeatedly to
nmY2kgWYwyQ,372639,375039,flatten it it's quite a strange product
nmY2kgWYwyQ,375039,376720,like it does actually feel quite solid
nmY2kgWYwyQ,376720,378720,and well made but then to look at it's
nmY2kgWYwyQ,378720,380880,more like a middle school origami
nmY2kgWYwyQ,380880,382800,project but then it is actually a proper
nmY2kgWYwyQ,382800,384800,digital camera with real interchangeable
nmY2kgWYwyQ,384800,387360,lenses so let's stick our sd card in
nmY2kgWYwyQ,387360,389280,here we've got a slider to select from a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,389280,391120,bunch of different filters one thing's
nmY2kgWYwyQ,391120,393280,for absolutely sure though these photos
nmY2kgWYwyQ,393280,396000,are an entire mood it's got a really
nmY2kgWYwyQ,396000,398720,old-school quirky style to it
nmY2kgWYwyQ,398720,400319,you know i would genuinely say that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,400319,402319,testing new speakers is one of my
nmY2kgWYwyQ,402319,404720,favorite things ever to do and that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,404720,406560,pleasure is never greater than when
nmY2kgWYwyQ,406560,408400,you're testing a record-breaking one
nmY2kgWYwyQ,408400,412400,this lenovo 700 is just 1.1 centimeter
nmY2kgWYwyQ,412400,415400,thick
nmY2kgWYwyQ,422560,423479,that is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,423479,425039,unbelievable
nmY2kgWYwyQ,425039,426880,how is that going to sound because
nmY2kgWYwyQ,426880,428720,normally for proper bass you need
nmY2kgWYwyQ,428720,430479,physical depth for the speaker to be
nmY2kgWYwyQ,430479,432479,able to like push air i think this is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,432479,434720,smaller than my phone the speaker's so
nmY2kgWYwyQ,434720,437440,thin the sound is so fat
nmY2kgWYwyQ,437440,438639,especially when you factor in that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,438639,440080,they've also apparently squeezed an
nmY2kgWYwyQ,440080,442319,eight hour battery life into this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,442319,444319,oh but we can actually get even thinner
nmY2kgWYwyQ,444319,446400,audio and to get this thin we're having
nmY2kgWYwyQ,446400,448800,to use a completely different technology
nmY2kgWYwyQ,448800,450400,this is blade
nmY2kgWYwyQ,450400,452560,it's not a speaker and of itself but you
nmY2kgWYwyQ,452560,454639,can place blade onto anything and i mean
nmY2kgWYwyQ,454639,456880,anything to turn that device into a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,456880,459280,speaker it sounds like science fiction
nmY2kgWYwyQ,459280,460800,instead of turning your music into a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,460800,462720,sound wave directly it's instead
nmY2kgWYwyQ,462720,464080,converting it into a mechanical
nmY2kgWYwyQ,464080,466560,vibration that can use the space inside
nmY2kgWYwyQ,466560,468800,another object as a sound chamber to
nmY2kgWYwyQ,468800,471599,induce that sound wave from it instead
nmY2kgWYwyQ,471599,472720,okay so you can kind of hear the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,472720,474500,vibration already right
nmY2kgWYwyQ,474500,476800,[Applause]
nmY2kgWYwyQ,476800,478720,it's like magic
nmY2kgWYwyQ,478720,481199,oh my god
nmY2kgWYwyQ,481199,483120,i can feel the bass through this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,483120,484639,cardboard box
nmY2kgWYwyQ,484639,486000,the bass i'm getting while it's sitting
nmY2kgWYwyQ,486000,488400,on this pc is insane
nmY2kgWYwyQ,488400,490400,okay we're about to break the one
nmY2kgWYwyQ,490400,492639,centimeter mark and i still can't quite
nmY2kgWYwyQ,492639,494080,believe that the product we're doing
nmY2kgWYwyQ,494080,496800,that with is a laptop this is the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,496800,498879,record-breaking acer swift seven
nmY2kgWYwyQ,498879,500639,apparently made possible through a razor
nmY2kgWYwyQ,500639,503039,thin magnesium aluminium alloy material
nmY2kgWYwyQ,503039,505440,and also presumably a severe trimming of
nmY2kgWYwyQ,505440,507120,the speakers and battery
nmY2kgWYwyQ,507120,508240,no
nmY2kgWYwyQ,508240,510800,it barely feels heavier than my ipad i
nmY2kgWYwyQ,510800,511759,feel like the hardest thing to
nmY2kgWYwyQ,511759,513599,complement here is the fact that this is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,513599,515919,two layers this is a screen a keyboard
nmY2kgWYwyQ,515919,518159,ports it's everything it genuinely feels
nmY2kgWYwyQ,518159,520080,like i'm using a dummy unit that doesn't
nmY2kgWYwyQ,520080,521839,actually function let's try watching a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,521839,523919,quick video the screen is a bit dim
nmY2kgWYwyQ,523919,526880,though and the speakers are oh yeah oh
nmY2kgWYwyQ,526880,528000,god
nmY2kgWYwyQ,528000,529200,moving on
nmY2kgWYwyQ,529200,531760,okay time to completely switch tact
nmY2kgWYwyQ,531760,534720,coming in at 0.9 centimeters thick these
nmY2kgWYwyQ,534720,536640,are the rove sunglasses
nmY2kgWYwyQ,536640,538399,slightly cheap packaging but we'll look
nmY2kgWYwyQ,538399,539760,past it
nmY2kgWYwyQ,539760,541120,and there it is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,541120,542880,i feel like i need to stress this 0.9
nmY2kgWYwyQ,542880,545040,centimeters is how thick they are when
nmY2kgWYwyQ,545040,549040,folded if i unfold them with one two
nmY2kgWYwyQ,549040,551600,three four five
nmY2kgWYwyQ,551600,553200,six oh
nmY2kgWYwyQ,553200,554240,seven
nmY2kgWYwyQ,554240,556560,this is so thin i feel like i could
nmY2kgWYwyQ,556560,558959,slice something with it fruit me
nmY2kgWYwyQ,558959,560839,just for
nmY2kgWYwyQ,560839,562690,science oh we're in
nmY2kgWYwyQ,562690,564880,[Music]
nmY2kgWYwyQ,564880,566720,no way i didn't think i'd be doing this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,566720,569040,today
nmY2kgWYwyQ,571040,573839,now sweeping in at just 0.8 centimeters
nmY2kgWYwyQ,573839,575279,we have that keyboard which is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,575279,577200,effectively just a sheet of glass with
nmY2kgWYwyQ,577200,579680,touch sensors on it doesn't sound the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,579680,581839,most appealing to use like the reason
nmY2kgWYwyQ,581839,583200,that normal keyboards are comfortable is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,583200,585040,that the keys will travel as you press
nmY2kgWYwyQ,585040,588240,them in this one doesn't have that and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,588240,590640,what is that font i can't complain too
nmY2kgWYwyQ,590640,592800,much though it's extremely thin and the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,592800,595040,core concept of this design is straight
nmY2kgWYwyQ,595040,597120,out of a sci-fi film plus if i turn it
nmY2kgWYwyQ,597120,599920,on here it also has leds baked in
nmY2kgWYwyQ,599920,601040,yeah
nmY2kgWYwyQ,601040,604160,this ain't the best
nmY2kgWYwyQ,604160,605680,kind of crazy though is that even
nmY2kgWYwyQ,605680,607760,thinner than that sheet of glass there
nmY2kgWYwyQ,607760,609519,is a company called espresso who's
nmY2kgWYwyQ,609519,611920,managed to build a fully working display
nmY2kgWYwyQ,611920,613680,it's not the highest spec screen out
nmY2kgWYwyQ,613680,616399,there it's a 1080p lcd but still the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,616399,619200,dimensions are shocking and it feels
nmY2kgWYwyQ,619200,621440,quality this is an aluminium and glass
nmY2kgWYwyQ,621440,623519,shell it reminds me a lot of an ipad in
nmY2kgWYwyQ,623519,625440,terms of design let's come back to that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,625440,627120,when we have all the pieces of this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,627120,628160,setup
nmY2kgWYwyQ,628160,630800,okay not so fun fact about me for quite
nmY2kgWYwyQ,630800,632240,a while now i have struggled with
nmY2kgWYwyQ,632240,634800,falling asleep i think my brain is so
nmY2kgWYwyQ,634800,636480,used to just constantly churning out
nmY2kgWYwyQ,636480,638640,video ideas that it doesn't know how to
nmY2kgWYwyQ,638640,641440,shut off anymore well these earbuds
nmY2kgWYwyQ,641440,643200,called the cocoon night buds are
nmY2kgWYwyQ,643200,645279,designed to solve that problem they're
nmY2kgWYwyQ,645279,647760,pretty funky looking but that's because
nmY2kgWYwyQ,647760,649600,of this hub in the middle here which is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,649600,651200,packed with sensors that we'll be able
nmY2kgWYwyQ,651200,653680,to detect when you've fallen asleep so
nmY2kgWYwyQ,653680,655120,you no longer need to keep setting these
nmY2kgWYwyQ,655120,657120,sleep timers for your content these
nmY2kgWYwyQ,657120,658959,earphones will automatically fade out
nmY2kgWYwyQ,658959,661040,your music the minute you no longer need
nmY2kgWYwyQ,661040,661760,it
nmY2kgWYwyQ,661760,663680,but that's not even the coolest bit they
nmY2kgWYwyQ,663680,665440,can also track your sleep quality and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,665440,667360,help you understand it they can detect
nmY2kgWYwyQ,667360,669440,snoring and mask the noise from it and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,669440,671440,they're so thin from every angle a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,671440,672880,quarter of the thickness of normal
nmY2kgWYwyQ,672880,674800,bluetooth buds for such that it doesn't
nmY2kgWYwyQ,674800,676320,really matter what position you're lying
nmY2kgWYwyQ,676320,678399,down in you can't really feel them they
nmY2kgWYwyQ,678399,680320,just they feel like an extension of your
nmY2kgWYwyQ,680320,682800,head based on a quick first impression i
nmY2kgWYwyQ,682800,684240,am a big fan of this and the sound
nmY2kgWYwyQ,684240,689800,quality is not the best but pretty good
nmY2kgWYwyQ,691160,693760,[Music]
nmY2kgWYwyQ,693760,695440,i think you just broke the box on my
nmY2kgWYwyQ,695440,698399,head okay well here's the product
nmY2kgWYwyQ,698399,700079,kind of looks like i damaged it more
nmY2kgWYwyQ,700079,701519,than it damaged me
nmY2kgWYwyQ,701519,704000,we're talking a mouse that is just 0.5
nmY2kgWYwyQ,704000,706800,centimeters thick incredible novelty but
nmY2kgWYwyQ,706800,708800,i just i can't quite understand apart
nmY2kgWYwyQ,708800,711040,from specifically this video
nmY2kgWYwyQ,711040,712720,who would buy this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,712720,714240,i feel like as we're getting further and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,714240,715839,further through this video each
nmY2kgWYwyQ,715839,717760,successive product is becoming more and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,717760,720959,more of a feat and this the remarkable 2
nmY2kgWYwyQ,720959,723519,tablet might be the coolest so far it's
nmY2kgWYwyQ,723519,726160,not an android tablet per se but it is a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,726160,729200,smart tablet of sorts and it just feels
nmY2kgWYwyQ,729200,731519,a bit surreal to hold it's like it's got
nmY2kgWYwyQ,731519,733680,the density and the weight of a coaster
nmY2kgWYwyQ,733680,735120,for your mug
nmY2kgWYwyQ,735120,736560,it doesn't feel like there's anything in
nmY2kgWYwyQ,736560,738639,there so for starters this is an
nmY2kgWYwyQ,738639,740639,e-reader just like a kindle but with a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,740639,742639,high-resolution large screen you can
nmY2kgWYwyQ,742639,744240,read web pages on it but more
nmY2kgWYwyQ,744240,746079,importantly thanks to this pencil right
nmY2kgWYwyQ,746079,748160,here you can write
nmY2kgWYwyQ,748160,749920,all right let's just give this a shot a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,749920,752000,sub to the channel would be
nmY2kgWYwyQ,752000,753519,remarkable
nmY2kgWYwyQ,753519,755760,this is shockingly responsive for an
nmY2kgWYwyQ,755760,758240,e-ink type display and oh check this if
nmY2kgWYwyQ,758240,759680,you write with the pen completely
nmY2kgWYwyQ,759680,761519,upright it comes out narrow but if you
nmY2kgWYwyQ,761519,763519,use the sides it's thicker you can even
nmY2kgWYwyQ,763519,765760,rub out using the eraser on the back but
nmY2kgWYwyQ,765760,768160,then maybe the coolest aspect of this is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,768160,770079,that with one tab i can convert all this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,770079,772480,handwritten text into an editable format
nmY2kgWYwyQ,772480,774320,and then literally pick up my phone and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,774320,776160,carry on where i left off
nmY2kgWYwyQ,776160,777839,don't really know how to rate this one
nmY2kgWYwyQ,777839,779279,though i've never really used anything
nmY2kgWYwyQ,779279,780720,like it
nmY2kgWYwyQ,780720,782480,thinnest power bank in the world coming
nmY2kgWYwyQ,782480,783920,right up
nmY2kgWYwyQ,783920,787600,what in god's name okay hold up this is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,787600,789839,my normal power bank
nmY2kgWYwyQ,789839,792639,this is the clutch charger it's it's
nmY2kgWYwyQ,792639,794560,literally the size of a credit card and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,794560,796639,it's not as useless as you might think
nmY2kgWYwyQ,796639,798480,it still has led indicator lights to
nmY2kgWYwyQ,798480,800320,show you its charge level it's got the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,800320,802880,usbc cable baked inside it i guess
nmY2kgWYwyQ,802880,804800,because it's so thin that it otherwise
nmY2kgWYwyQ,804800,806639,wouldn't fit and the battery capacity
nmY2kgWYwyQ,806639,808560,itself is still three thousand milliamp
nmY2kgWYwyQ,808560,810639,hours which you know we've seen more
nmY2kgWYwyQ,810639,812240,we've seen way more but that's still
nmY2kgWYwyQ,812240,813839,enough to get your phone from completely
nmY2kgWYwyQ,813839,816480,dead to anywhere between 50 and 100
nmY2kgWYwyQ,816480,818240,depending on what model is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,818240,820360,speaking of credit cards though at just
nmY2kgWYwyQ,820360,823279,0.15 centimeters which is basically
nmY2kgWYwyQ,823279,825199,two-dimensional at this point we have
nmY2kgWYwyQ,825199,827120,the win wallet i mean it's safe to say
nmY2kgWYwyQ,827120,829279,this is at least five times thinner than
nmY2kgWYwyQ,829279,831440,any other wallet i've ever seen it is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,831440,833600,very cool but i'm just thinking like
nmY2kgWYwyQ,833600,835760,when you get to a stage like this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,835760,837760,can you really call it a wallet like at
nmY2kgWYwyQ,837760,839920,this point isn't it basically just a 3d
nmY2kgWYwyQ,839920,841600,printed clip
nmY2kgWYwyQ,841600,843680,all right so just before the thinnest
nmY2kgWYwyQ,843680,845760,thing in this entire video i've got
nmY2kgWYwyQ,845760,847199,something pretty mind-blowing to show
nmY2kgWYwyQ,847199,848800,you you know how we had that thinnest
nmY2kgWYwyQ,848800,850959,espresso display well
nmY2kgWYwyQ,850959,853279,that is nothing compared to what royal
nmY2kgWYwyQ,853279,855279,has come up with okay so the display
nmY2kgWYwyQ,855279,857600,connector has got to go into the power
nmY2kgWYwyQ,857600,858399,board
nmY2kgWYwyQ,858399,861360,we're gonna need a power supply this is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,861360,863760,like really high stakes lego and then if
nmY2kgWYwyQ,863760,866240,we had a power source
nmY2kgWYwyQ,866240,867360,oh
nmY2kgWYwyQ,867360,869120,my
nmY2kgWYwyQ,869120,871199,god
nmY2kgWYwyQ,871199,873040,i genuinely think this is the coolest
nmY2kgWYwyQ,873040,875600,piece of tech i've ever held in my hands
nmY2kgWYwyQ,875600,877199,what you're looking at right now is a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,877199,879120,fully functional android device that's
nmY2kgWYwyQ,879120,881279,barely thicker than a piece of paper and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,881279,883440,it is completely flexible this is
nmY2kgWYwyQ,883440,885600,basically a development kit it's royal
nmY2kgWYwyQ,885600,887600,saying to other companies look look at
nmY2kgWYwyQ,887600,889600,our screen look how versatile it is look
nmY2kgWYwyQ,889600,891600,how bright and beautiful it is look how
nmY2kgWYwyQ,891600,894079,thin it is these screens already exist
nmY2kgWYwyQ,894079,895440,on some foldable phones that you might
nmY2kgWYwyQ,895440,897600,have already seen but it's just being
nmY2kgWYwyQ,897600,899760,able to hold the display on its own and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,899760,902160,use it as a standalone device it kind of
nmY2kgWYwyQ,902160,904160,just opens you up to what's potentially
nmY2kgWYwyQ,904160,906000,possible well let's see if we can make a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,906000,907920,call actually where am i going to fit a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,907920,909600,sim card in on that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,909600,911360,i sound like a broken record at this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,911360,912639,point but
nmY2kgWYwyQ,912639,916000,we are getting even thinner
nmY2kgWYwyQ,917440,920160,oh my i just realized something you know
nmY2kgWYwyQ,920160,922240,this like incredibly incredibly thin
nmY2kgWYwyQ,922240,923920,mouse mat we have here
nmY2kgWYwyQ,923920,925920,this is the mouse mat with a layer of
nmY2kgWYwyQ,925920,928959,packaging all around it
nmY2kgWYwyQ,930959,934510,it almost feels like i'm gripping air
nmY2kgWYwyQ,934510,937040,[Applause]
nmY2kgWYwyQ,937040,938839,oh
nmY2kgWYwyQ,938839,941920,oh i have never seen a mouse pad like it
nmY2kgWYwyQ,941920,942959,oh
nmY2kgWYwyQ,942959,944160,wait
nmY2kgWYwyQ,944160,947519,there's another layer to peel off
nmY2kgWYwyQ,949040,952160,that that's just ridiculous
nmY2kgWYwyQ,952160,953600,so there you have it the thinnest
nmY2kgWYwyQ,953600,956480,extreme pc setup ever okay so you know
nmY2kgWYwyQ,956480,957920,how we just got like the thinnest wallet
nmY2kgWYwyQ,957920,959600,ever and we were wondering what exactly
nmY2kgWYwyQ,959600,962199,we could pay for with it well
nmY2kgWYwyQ,962199,964399,surfsharkvpn hear me out here this
nmY2kgWYwyQ,964399,966000,service is not ten dollars or five
nmY2kgWYwyQ,966000,968800,dollars it is 249 a month which split
nmY2kgWYwyQ,968800,970639,between the seven people i share it with
nmY2kgWYwyQ,970639,973519,comes out to just 36 cents and that 36
nmY2kgWYwyQ,973519,975360,cents gives me anonymity especially when
nmY2kgWYwyQ,975360,977199,i'm logged into public wi-fi networks
nmY2kgWYwyQ,977199,978959,which are the most vulnerable better
nmY2kgWYwyQ,978959,981120,prices for products that use my browser
nmY2kgWYwyQ,981120,982639,cookies to try to make things more
nmY2kgWYwyQ,982639,984399,expensive for me access to the full
nmY2kgWYwyQ,984399,986399,internet including sites blocked by my
nmY2kgWYwyQ,986399,988320,region like tv shows from another
nmY2kgWYwyQ,988320,991600,country and encryption every minute that
nmY2kgWYwyQ,991600,993519,you spend online companies are recording
nmY2kgWYwyQ,993519,995360,data about who you are and what you're
nmY2kgWYwyQ,995360,997279,doing which means that even if these
nmY2kgWYwyQ,997279,998880,companies don't have any nefarious
nmY2kgWYwyQ,998880,1001120,intentions when there's a data breach
nmY2kgWYwyQ,1001120,1002800,that data can fall into the hands of
nmY2kgWYwyQ,1002800,1004800,someone who does things like your
nmY2kgWYwyQ,1004800,1007199,location information so give it a go and
nmY2kgWYwyQ,1007199,1008000,if you do hit the link in the
nmY2kgWYwyQ,1008000,1010000,description and use code boss it's not
nmY2kgWYwyQ,1010000,1011839,just that you get it for that 249 a
nmY2kgWYwyQ,1011839,1013519,month price but you also get three
nmY2kgWYwyQ,1013519,1015839,months for free on top of that fully
