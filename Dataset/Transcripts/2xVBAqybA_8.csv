2xVBAqybA_8,17200,20660,Yes. Absolutely 100% yes.
2xVBAqybA_8,20660,23100,Chemistry is everywhere in everything.
2xVBAqybA_8,23100,26250,"If you can see it, breathe, it, touch it, it's chemistry."
2xVBAqybA_8,26250,29369,We're taking atoms and rearranging them into different ways.
2xVBAqybA_8,29370,31740,"And it's just chemistry, everywhere, everything."
2xVBAqybA_8,31740,33800,Everything around us. It's elemental.

2xVBAqybA_8,38810,41010,"and Mentos make a chemical reaction?"""
2xVBAqybA_8,41010,42820,"Mentos is a porous candy,"
2xVBAqybA_8,42820,45640,and so if you look really closely at a Mentos-
2xVBAqybA_8,45640,46770,Mento? Mentos.
2xVBAqybA_8,46770,48940,All of it on the outside has these little holes.
2xVBAqybA_8,48940,50030,There's these little pores.
2xVBAqybA_8,50030,52059,"And when we drop it into Diet Coke,"
2xVBAqybA_8,52060,54950,that is immediately attractive to carbon dioxide.
2xVBAqybA_8,54950,59200,"So all the carbon dioxide in the soda rushes to the candy,"
2xVBAqybA_8,59200,61420,and it starts to sit on those pores.
2xVBAqybA_8,61420,63710,But it's not just one carbon dioxide molecule
2xVBAqybA_8,63710,65830,"or a second carbon dioxide molecule,"
2xVBAqybA_8,65830,67270,it's hundreds and thousands
2xVBAqybA_8,67270,69119,of them slamming together at once.
2xVBAqybA_8,69120,70460,"So as they reach the candy,"
2xVBAqybA_8,70460,72290,"they're smashing into each other here,"
2xVBAqybA_8,72290,73370,they build up pressure
2xVBAqybA_8,73370,75650,and they end up shooting straight out of the Diet Coke.
2xVBAqybA_8,75650,78120,And so we have this really beautiful soda volcano.
2xVBAqybA_8,78120,80500,It has nothing to do with the Diet Coke itself.
2xVBAqybA_8,80500,83220,"It's the fact that there's carbon dioxide in the soda,"
2xVBAqybA_8,83220,85620,and it's the shape of the candy itself.
2xVBAqybA_8,85620,87480,"So you could do this experiment with Coke,"
2xVBAqybA_8,87480,90160,"with Mountain Dew, with any soda you want."
2xVBAqybA_8,90160,93020,It just so happens that Diet Cokes works really well
2xVBAqybA_8,93020,94340,and it doesn't contain the sugar
2xVBAqybA_8,94340,95939,so it's much easier to clean up.
2xVBAqybA_8,95940,98227,"Now, @HollyJean05 wants to know,"
2xVBAqybA_8,98227,102060,"""In chemistry, how do you get two bonds to break up?"""
2xVBAqybA_8,102060,104770,This feels like a joke. [laughs]
2xVBAqybA_8,104770,106289,I will say you can get two bonds
2xVBAqybA_8,106290,111180,to break whenever you have neighboring atoms
2xVBAqybA_8,111180,112780,that they are more attracted to.
2xVBAqybA_8,112780,114270,So let me give you an example.
2xVBAqybA_8,114270,115630,"I don't know if you've ever heard of this,"
2xVBAqybA_8,115630,117570,"but Blake lively and Ryan Reynolds,"
2xVBAqybA_8,117570,118880,"when they were first together,"
2xVBAqybA_8,118880,121530,they were set up on blind dates with other people.
2xVBAqybA_8,121530,123310,And so you have Blake and another man
2xVBAqybA_8,123310,124740,with Ryan and another woman.
2xVBAqybA_8,124740,127119,"And so they're sitting across the table from each other,"
2xVBAqybA_8,127120,129229,"not interested in their original pairing,"
2xVBAqybA_8,129229,130940,very interested in each other.
2xVBAqybA_8,130940,133650,And so this is referred to as a double replacement reaction
2xVBAqybA_8,133650,135870,where you start off partnered with somebody else
2xVBAqybA_8,135870,138150,"but then you see something that's better, a better option."
2xVBAqybA_8,138150,140000,"I mean, it's Ryan Reynolds. How can you- you know?"
2xVBAqybA_8,140000,142180,And so then you form another bond.
2xVBAqybA_8,142180,144120,"And so now Blake and Ryan are now paired,"
2xVBAqybA_8,144120,145260,"and then these other two are not,"
2xVBAqybA_8,145260,147349,but in theory they could be partnered up if they wanted to.
2xVBAqybA_8,147350,148330,So it's as simple as that.
2xVBAqybA_8,148330,150880,Your atoms are more attracted to something else.
2xVBAqybA_8,150880,152787,"@kickthepj wants to know,"

2xVBAqybA_8,158540,160189,"How do I get them out of there?"""
2xVBAqybA_8,160190,162010,"Oh, no! [laughs]"
2xVBAqybA_8,162010,166180,"PJ, you want chemicals in your brain. You need them."
2xVBAqybA_8,166180,169219,"Otherwise, you're not gonna be able to function at all."
2xVBAqybA_8,169220,171330,"For example, adenosine is in your brain,"
2xVBAqybA_8,171330,173500,"and that helps you get sleepy or drowsy,"
2xVBAqybA_8,173500,176280,so it encourages your body to go to sleep.
2xVBAqybA_8,176280,179110,You absolutely need these molecules in your brain.
2xVBAqybA_8,179110,182057,"Without them, you would not be a functioning human."
2xVBAqybA_8,182057,184317,"@courtkneerose wants to know,"
2xVBAqybA_8,184317,187430,"""If atoms are primarily composed of empty space,"
2xVBAqybA_8,187430,190250,"why can't you pass your hand through a solid object?"""
2xVBAqybA_8,190250,191650,So let's go to the basics here.
2xVBAqybA_8,191650,194220,"And atom is formed with a nucleus in the center,"
2xVBAqybA_8,194220,196620,"and in the center, you have protons and neutrons."
2xVBAqybA_8,196620,200290,"So if my body was an atom, my kidneys, my liver,"
2xVBAqybA_8,200290,203579,"those would be my protons and neutrons, like inside my core."
2xVBAqybA_8,203580,205260,"Now, on the outside of your atom,"
2xVBAqybA_8,205260,207030,that's where your electrons are moving around.
2xVBAqybA_8,207030,209290,"So that would be like my gloves or, you know,"
2xVBAqybA_8,209290,210469,my sunglasses or a hat.
2xVBAqybA_8,210470,211940,Something that's on the outside.
2xVBAqybA_8,211940,215100,So atoms can really easily exchange electrons
2xVBAqybA_8,215100,216130,to a neighboring atom.
2xVBAqybA_8,216130,218350,I can give you my gloves. I can give you my scarf.
2xVBAqybA_8,218350,220370,I can't really give you my kidney or my liver.
2xVBAqybA_8,220370,221780,That's gonna be really difficult.
2xVBAqybA_8,221780,223120,So we can exchange electrons
2xVBAqybA_8,223120,224959,but not so much protons and neutrons.
2xVBAqybA_8,224960,227470,"Now, the question here is why can't you pass your hand"
2xVBAqybA_8,227470,228590,through a solid object?
2xVBAqybA_8,228590,229830,And the reason being is
2xVBAqybA_8,229830,232470,'cause that nucleus is extraordinarily dense.
2xVBAqybA_8,232470,233820,"It's very, very dense."
2xVBAqybA_8,233820,235590,"It's got those neutrons, those protons,"
2xVBAqybA_8,235590,237400,and it takes up a lot of space.
2xVBAqybA_8,237400,239060,"And so yes, you can pass your hand"
2xVBAqybA_8,239060,240709,"through the spot that has all the electrons,"
2xVBAqybA_8,240710,242470,"but as soon as you slam into that nucleus,"
2xVBAqybA_8,242470,245560,that's a dense object that you cannot pass through.
2xVBAqybA_8,245560,248857,"Now we have @Carlee0575 wants to know,"
2xVBAqybA_8,248857,250319,"""How do pheromones work?"""
2xVBAqybA_8,250320,251910,Pheromones are so cool.
2xVBAqybA_8,251910,254970,So what happens is one animal- let's say you have an ant-
2xVBAqybA_8,254970,256730,is going to release some pheromones.
2xVBAqybA_8,256730,258420,Then a neighboring ant is going
2xVBAqybA_8,258420,260870,"to absorb those pheromones into their body,"
2xVBAqybA_8,260870,262699,"and all of a sudden have all these new signals,"
2xVBAqybA_8,262700,263810,some information.
2xVBAqybA_8,263810,266310,So ants tell each other where food is.
2xVBAqybA_8,266310,269980,Other animals could possibly give out sex pheromones.
2xVBAqybA_8,269980,271780,"So it's kind of like a way to play cupid,"
2xVBAqybA_8,271780,273639,and you can encourage someone else to be attracted
2xVBAqybA_8,273640,275330,to you just by giving those off.
2xVBAqybA_8,275330,278599,"Unfortunately, humans don't have sex pheromones"
2xVBAqybA_8,278600,280100,because we learned how to communicate.
2xVBAqybA_8,280100,282590,"So if we just wink and give a little high five,"
2xVBAqybA_8,282590,284389,usually that can send the message across.
2xVBAqybA_8,284390,286080,We don't need to shove our hormones
2xVBAqybA_8,286080,288167,into someone else to make them attracted to us.
2xVBAqybA_8,288167,290910,"@IQAir wants to know, ""What's in a firework?"""
2xVBAqybA_8,290910,293400,"It's a combination of potassium nitrate,"
2xVBAqybA_8,293400,295710,"some carbon, and some sulfur."
2xVBAqybA_8,295710,296910,So essentially what happens
2xVBAqybA_8,296910,300690,"is the potassium nitrate decomposes, releasing oxygen gas."
2xVBAqybA_8,300690,304040,"When oxygen is in the presence of charcoal or carbon,"
2xVBAqybA_8,304040,305000,"it's gonna burn,"
2xVBAqybA_8,305000,307420,and the sulfur helps to create a lot of smoke.
2xVBAqybA_8,307420,309540,"Now, there's usually a second piece in there,"
2xVBAqybA_8,309540,311950,"like a delayed timer that's going on, as well."
2xVBAqybA_8,311950,313880,"And so once that gets hot enough,"
2xVBAqybA_8,313880,315300,that's gonna do the second boom.
2xVBAqybA_8,315300,318009,So the first explosion gets us all the way up to the sky.
2xVBAqybA_8,318010,320590,And the second explosion gives us the huge bang.
2xVBAqybA_8,320590,322310,Now this is where we see the colors.
2xVBAqybA_8,322310,324860,"So if there's red, there's gonna be some strontium in there."
2xVBAqybA_8,324860,327560,"If there's some green or blue, there's probably copper."
2xVBAqybA_8,327560,329040,The pinks are from potassium.
2xVBAqybA_8,329040,331920,"Those burnt orange, beautiful colors, those are from sodium."
2xVBAqybA_8,331920,333810,"So it's a big mixture of molecules,"
2xVBAqybA_8,333810,335680,and it's all thanks to chemistry.
2xVBAqybA_8,335680,336513,"Okay, next one."

2xVBAqybA_8,342050,344930,I know! Electrolytes are charged minerals.
2xVBAqybA_8,344930,347960,So they're cations and anions in the human body.
2xVBAqybA_8,347960,351819,"So often we see things like sodium, calcium, magnesium,"
2xVBAqybA_8,351820,353050,"maybe some chlorine,"
2xVBAqybA_8,353050,356590,and they all make sure that your body functions properly.
2xVBAqybA_8,356590,359320,So they're in charge of sending nerve signals
2xVBAqybA_8,359320,360153,through your body.
2xVBAqybA_8,360153,362270,They're in charge of making sure your heart beats.

2xVBAqybA_8,368010,371360,The chlorine is even used to help digest things
2xVBAqybA_8,371360,372193,in your stomach.
2xVBAqybA_8,372193,375289,So it's all over your body and you need these electrolytes.

2xVBAqybA_8,389330,390780,"Oh, this is a great question."
2xVBAqybA_8,390780,393560,Home pregnancy tests work very similarly
2xVBAqybA_8,393560,395570,to our rapid COVID test.
2xVBAqybA_8,395570,396980,So you have a piece of paper
2xVBAqybA_8,396980,399640,and you have an antibody that's essentially sewn
2xVBAqybA_8,399640,400940,into the paper.
2xVBAqybA_8,400940,402900,"So when a woman becomes pregnant,"
2xVBAqybA_8,402900,405729,"about 10 days after conception,"
2xVBAqybA_8,405730,408110,we have this hormone called hCG.
2xVBAqybA_8,408110,412699,"And what happens is you can urinate that out onto your test,"
2xVBAqybA_8,412700,416070,"and if that hormone is present in the urine,"
2xVBAqybA_8,416070,418750,"it will bind to the antibody in the test,"
2xVBAqybA_8,418750,421030,and it will activate a dye molecule.
2xVBAqybA_8,421030,423270,And so that's where you'll see that blue plus sign
2xVBAqybA_8,423270,425710,or the blue word pregnant or anything like that.
2xVBAqybA_8,425710,429259,"Fun fact, a long time ago in ancient Egypt,"
2xVBAqybA_8,429260,430870,they used to use home pregnancy tests

2xVBAqybA_8,434450,436340,"And if they sprouted really quickly,"
2xVBAqybA_8,436340,438410,that hormone must be present in the woman
2xVBAqybA_8,438410,440030,because that's what activated those seeds
2xVBAqybA_8,440030,441389,and make them sprout really quickly.
2xVBAqybA_8,441390,443010,So they could actually detect pregnancy
2xVBAqybA_8,443010,445690,with about 70% to 85% accuracy.

2xVBAqybA_8,505590,507710,and I have vividly remembered that.
2xVBAqybA_8,507710,510966,And I am unbelievably anal about my goggles now.
2xVBAqybA_8,510967,515820,"@BitterMode_ON asks, ""Who created the periodic table?"""
2xVBAqybA_8,515820,517289,It depends who you're asking.
2xVBAqybA_8,517289,519750,The very first version of the periodic table
2xVBAqybA_8,519750,522830,was a man who brought three elements together
2xVBAqybA_8,522830,525440,and just put them together based on explosiveness.
2xVBAqybA_8,525440,526750,The second guy came through
2xVBAqybA_8,526750,529750,and took these little sets of three and made triads
2xVBAqybA_8,529750,532730,"and made little Ts with them, and so little Xs."
2xVBAqybA_8,532730,535079,"But at that point, we had to memorize all these Ts,"
2xVBAqybA_8,535080,536520,and it was really complicated.
2xVBAqybA_8,536520,538520,"So two men at the exact same time,"
2xVBAqybA_8,538520,540240,"but separately, individually."
2xVBAqybA_8,540240,543730,So Dmitri Mendeleev and the Lothar Meyer came together
2xVBAqybA_8,543730,546430,and they organized all of our elements based
2xVBAqybA_8,546430,548290,on increasing atomic mass.
2xVBAqybA_8,548290,551240,But here's why Dmitri Mendeleev always gets the credit.
2xVBAqybA_8,551240,552750,He noticed a pattern.
2xVBAqybA_8,552750,556610,"So let's say we had a pattern like 2, 4, 8, 10."
2xVBAqybA_8,556610,558350,There's that missing number six.
2xVBAqybA_8,558350,561449,"So we would see that it would go, okay, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,"
2xVBAqybA_8,561450,563560,and Mendeleev did the exact same thing.
2xVBAqybA_8,563560,565130,"He was like, ""There are two elements"
2xVBAqybA_8,565130,566740,"that we are definitely missing."""
2xVBAqybA_8,566740,569010,He saw the pattern and left holes for that
2xVBAqybA_8,569010,570400,in the periodic table.
2xVBAqybA_8,570400,571760,"So 10 years later,"
2xVBAqybA_8,571760,574110,"when gallium and germanium were discovered,"
2xVBAqybA_8,574110,576910,Mendeleev was given all the credit for the periodic table
2xVBAqybA_8,576910,579920,"because not only did he order it in increasing atomic mass,"
2xVBAqybA_8,579920,582630,but he also predicted these unknown elements.
2xVBAqybA_8,582630,583900,"Pretty cool, right?"
2xVBAqybA_8,583900,587960,"Next up from @SaintMaryTulsa, ""Why does popcorn pop?"
2xVBAqybA_8,587960,590930,"How does a lava lamp work? And how do you make slime?"""
2xVBAqybA_8,590930,593640,"Popcorn kernels have a little piece of water in there,"
2xVBAqybA_8,593640,596350,so a couple water molecules in the liquid state.
2xVBAqybA_8,596350,597759,"Now, when we heat them up,"
2xVBAqybA_8,597760,601920,"the liquid water converts to gaseous water, so it vaporizes."
2xVBAqybA_8,601920,604550,"But the gas takes up space and it moves around,"
2xVBAqybA_8,604550,607140,so it's slamming against the side of the kernel.
2xVBAqybA_8,607140,609320,And eventually when it has a high enough velocity
2xVBAqybA_8,609320,610560,"or enough kinetic energy,"
2xVBAqybA_8,610560,612870,it actually pushes that kernel to pop.
2xVBAqybA_8,612870,614740,And now you made popcorn.
2xVBAqybA_8,614740,617180,"For a lava lamp, equally cool."
2xVBAqybA_8,617180,620279,"What we have is some kind of container that has, usually,"
2xVBAqybA_8,620280,623090,oil on top and then liquid at bottom.
2xVBAqybA_8,623090,626330,And then what you need to do is somehow generate some gas.
2xVBAqybA_8,626330,628000,A simple way of doing this would be
2xVBAqybA_8,628000,629800,"to add like an Alka-Seltzer tablet,"
2xVBAqybA_8,629800,631490,which would generate carbon dioxide.
2xVBAqybA_8,631490,634040,"And so the gas forms at the bottom of the lava lamp,"
2xVBAqybA_8,634040,635600,and it starts to pull up.
2xVBAqybA_8,635600,638990,"As it goes up, it kind of drags the water molecules with it,"
2xVBAqybA_8,638990,640790,and they go all the way up to the top.
2xVBAqybA_8,640790,643570,"So visually, we see the water molecules move"
2xVBAqybA_8,643570,644950,"through the oil layer,"
2xVBAqybA_8,644950,646960,"they get to the top, the gas pops,"
2xVBAqybA_8,646960,648800,"it lets go of the water molecule,"
2xVBAqybA_8,648800,651290,"water's more dense than oil, so it sinks down to the bottom."
2xVBAqybA_8,651290,653209,And then the process just repeats itself.
2xVBAqybA_8,653210,655800,"Carbon dioxide goes up, it pops, water comes back down."
2xVBAqybA_8,655800,658180,Over and over again. Very beautiful.
2xVBAqybA_8,658180,661200,"Last one, ""How do you make slime?"" Fantastic question."
2xVBAqybA_8,661200,662050,Let me show you.
2xVBAqybA_8,662050,663760,"You'll need about one cup of glue,"
2xVBAqybA_8,663760,665420,three cups of shaving cream.
2xVBAqybA_8,665420,667470,"So now we're gonna stir, stir, stir."
2xVBAqybA_8,667470,670449,"After that, we're gonna add one teaspoon of baking soda."
2xVBAqybA_8,670450,671600,"Again, stir, stir, stir."
2xVBAqybA_8,671600,673730,"So if you're adding glitter or food coloring,"
2xVBAqybA_8,673730,674850,now go to town.
2xVBAqybA_8,674850,676819,"So we're looking for a nice homogenous mixture,"
2xVBAqybA_8,676820,678920,so it's all really mixed together.
2xVBAqybA_8,678920,681290,Two tablespoons of contact solution is going
2xVBAqybA_8,681290,683670,to activate your slime because we're adding boron.
2xVBAqybA_8,683670,686339,"Let this sit for like, I don't know, 30 minutes or so,"
2xVBAqybA_8,686340,687900,and let that reaction happen.
2xVBAqybA_8,687900,690340,"But if you can't wait, like me, I can't ever wait,"
2xVBAqybA_8,690340,692450,stick your hands right in there.
2xVBAqybA_8,692450,693283,Ooh!

2xVBAqybA_8,701740,703240,So what we usually use
2xVBAqybA_8,703240,707029,is a hypochlorite hypochlorous acid buffer.
2xVBAqybA_8,707030,711643,"It is a buffer, or a solution, that locks the pH into 7.52."
2xVBAqybA_8,712720,714589,So what happens is if you add something
2xVBAqybA_8,714590,715720,"that's slightly acidic,"
2xVBAqybA_8,715720,718259,the basic component of the buffer reaches out
2xVBAqybA_8,718260,721120,"and eats that, neutralizes it, keeps the pool clean."
2xVBAqybA_8,721120,723130,"If you add something that's slightly basic,"
2xVBAqybA_8,723130,725080,the acidic part of the buffer will reach out
2xVBAqybA_8,725080,727170,and eat that and keep the pool nice and clean.

2xVBAqybA_8,737210,739500,"So evaporation and boiling are similar,"
2xVBAqybA_8,739500,740430,but they're different.
2xVBAqybA_8,740430,743120,So boiling happens at a very specific temperature.
2xVBAqybA_8,743120,746150,"So here on earth at atmospheric pressure,"
2xVBAqybA_8,746150,748820,"water is going to boil at a hundred degrees Celsius,"
2xVBAqybA_8,748820,751120,or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
2xVBAqybA_8,751120,752900,But that is always going to happen
2xVBAqybA_8,752900,754610,at that specific temperature.
2xVBAqybA_8,754610,757079,Evaporation can happen anytime.

2xVBAqybA_8,780070,782830,It does not need to be a hundred degrees Celsius
