sZ12W9uqxR4,54800,57120,for a huge pen or a huge pasture and so
sZ12W9uqxR4,57120,58879,they've had to literally build a pen

sZ12W9uqxR4,92159,92880,of africa
sZ12W9uqxR4,92880,94479,[Music]

sZ12W9uqxR4,97600,99439,with five different climate zones from

sZ12W9uqxR4,108479,109520,we can eat
sZ12W9uqxR4,109520,111360,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,111360,113520,this is the home of the chaga people the
sZ12W9uqxR4,113520,115840,third largest ethnic group in tanzania
sZ12W9uqxR4,115840,117200,renowned for their prowess in
sZ12W9uqxR4,117200,119759,agriculture and their effective use this
sZ12W9uqxR4,119759,121280,one this right here
sZ12W9uqxR4,121280,122640,of bananas

sZ12W9uqxR4,136160,137840,the old poking technique whacking the
sZ12W9uqxR4,137840,140000,tree in half and collecting the goods
sZ12W9uqxR4,140000,143840,yes we got some bananas
sZ12W9uqxR4,144319,146400,unlike other plants bananas can only
sZ12W9uqxR4,146400,148560,produce one fruit per stock so it's
sZ12W9uqxR4,148560,150400,important to cut down old stocks for the
sZ12W9uqxR4,150400,153200,new ones to grow our brave gatherer over
sZ12W9uqxR4,153200,155280,here has produced a whole what do you

sZ12W9uqxR4,165680,170560,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,170560,172080,on the way back there's one more
sZ12W9uqxR4,172080,174319,ingredient needed for breakfast local
sZ12W9uqxR4,174319,176800,wild yams this is what i want oh that's
sZ12W9uqxR4,176800,178879,a tiny little yam another staple of the
sZ12W9uqxR4,178879,181599,chaga diet
sZ12W9uqxR4,182239,183360,here we have the bananas we've just
sZ12W9uqxR4,183360,185120,brought them back she's peeling it now
sZ12W9uqxR4,185120,186800,and it is hard to peel off but you can
sZ12W9uqxR4,186800,188560,hear it's very tough and coarse as she
sZ12W9uqxR4,188560,191920,breaks it this is hard like a tuber let
sZ12W9uqxR4,191920,193840,me see if i can crack it in half
sZ12W9uqxR4,193840,195680,yeah it just snaps into half there's
sZ12W9uqxR4,195680,197440,nothing soft about it and even on the
sZ12W9uqxR4,197440,199040,inside it looks pretty different from
sZ12W9uqxR4,199040,201040,other bananas i've seen before and with
sZ12W9uqxR4,201040,203519,this kind of hard constitution they boil
sZ12W9uqxR4,203519,205280,it and then they make a banana soup that
sZ12W9uqxR4,205280,207360,is going to be our breakfast soon if i
sZ12W9uqxR4,207360,208070,didn't ruin it
sZ12W9uqxR4,208070,211040,[Music]

sZ12W9uqxR4,225599,227120,centimeters of snow and you'll be
sZ12W9uqxR4,227120,228640,freezing your ass off does that sound
sZ12W9uqxR4,228640,230879,like paradise maybe it would be my
sZ12W9uqxR4,230879,232400,paradise can you tell me what we're
sZ12W9uqxR4,232400,233840,going to be eating for breakfast today
sZ12W9uqxR4,233840,236000,now we're just going to eat some kind of
sZ12W9uqxR4,236000,238879,food called itori in swahili in todori
sZ12W9uqxR4,238879,241200,tori
sZ12W9uqxR4,241360,243120,or banana beef stew is a famous
sZ12W9uqxR4,243120,245200,tanzanian dish that comes originally
sZ12W9uqxR4,245200,247280,from the kilimanjaro region
sZ12W9uqxR4,247280,250400,here they make it from bananas and yams
sZ12W9uqxR4,250400,252400,i've heard of bananas for breakfast but
sZ12W9uqxR4,252400,254560,next these starches are topped with
sZ12W9uqxR4,254560,257199,boiled beef then another layer of banana
sZ12W9uqxR4,257199,259919,yam some salt and water seal it with a
sZ12W9uqxR4,259919,261919,banana leaf and let it steam for 30
sZ12W9uqxR4,261919,264160,minutes
sZ12W9uqxR4,264160,266000,after it's cooked through add cooking
sZ12W9uqxR4,266000,269280,oil and water mash it until it becomes
sZ12W9uqxR4,269280,271680,one thick sticky paste and finish it off
sZ12W9uqxR4,271680,272980,with beef stock
sZ12W9uqxR4,272980,274320,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,274320,276080,all right i'm gonna try just the
sZ12W9uqxR4,276080,279680,porridge part first without the beef
sZ12W9uqxR4,279680,281600,oh wow it doesn't taste like banana at
sZ12W9uqxR4,281600,283680,all it's just really starchy almost like
sZ12W9uqxR4,283680,285520,eating a potato so it's really thick and
sZ12W9uqxR4,285520,287120,quite delicious that's awesome and then
sZ12W9uqxR4,287120,288770,there's some beef here
sZ12W9uqxR4,288770,290479,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,290479,292160,a little tendon in there too
sZ12W9uqxR4,292160,294080,definitely
sZ12W9uqxR4,294080,295680,i just came here from meeting with the
sZ12W9uqxR4,295680,297680,zigua tribe
sZ12W9uqxR4,297680,299600,and so they are very agricultural but
sZ12W9uqxR4,299600,301280,not pastoral at all and so they don't
sZ12W9uqxR4,301280,302800,really have any animals except for
sZ12W9uqxR4,302800,304720,chickens when i asked why it was simply
sZ12W9uqxR4,304720,306000,because they didn't have the knowledge
sZ12W9uqxR4,306000,307520,about what to do with those animals and
sZ12W9uqxR4,307520,309360,how to raise them but here you have like
sZ12W9uqxR4,309360,311199,every farm animal i could imagine
sZ12W9uqxR4,311199,312560,where'd you learn all this we're just
sZ12W9uqxR4,312560,314320,heritaging all this kind of lifestyle
sZ12W9uqxR4,314320,316160,from our grandparents so you just grew
sZ12W9uqxR4,316160,317440,up like this
sZ12W9uqxR4,317440,319280,because even the maasai people they do
sZ12W9uqxR4,319280,320720,have livestock but they have to handle
sZ12W9uqxR4,320720,321919,it in a very different way than you
sZ12W9uqxR4,321919,323360,because you're on the mountain here the
sZ12W9uqxR4,323360,325520,problem is we don't have enough spaces
sZ12W9uqxR4,325520,327600,where we can dress them free we call it
sZ12W9uqxR4,327600,329520,zero grazing system so we just tied them
sZ12W9uqxR4,329520,331919,inside and we just went outside looking
sZ12W9uqxR4,331919,334240,for different grasses and then we just
sZ12W9uqxR4,334240,336400,bring something back to them so it's
sZ12W9uqxR4,336400,338479,like that
sZ12W9uqxR4,338479,340240,this is a fantastic start today we're
sZ12W9uqxR4,340240,341360,gonna try something that's really
sZ12W9uqxR4,341360,342800,traditional in the village we're gonna
sZ12W9uqxR4,342800,344800,cook an entire goat do you have a goat
sZ12W9uqxR4,344800,346560,picked out already i have to decide and
sZ12W9uqxR4,346560,348720,how will you decide by looking the size
sZ12W9uqxR4,348720,350880,and how old it is but not like how much
sZ12W9uqxR4,350880,353680,you like them i like them all but i must
sZ12W9uqxR4,353680,355120,choose one that's our next step you're
sZ12W9uqxR4,355120,356639,gonna see uh which one gives you the
sZ12W9uqxR4,356639,358160,side eye which is the meanest looking
sZ12W9uqxR4,358160,359919,one and we'll pull it out all right all
sZ12W9uqxR4,359919,362919,right
sZ12W9uqxR4,364160,372259,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,376000,378160,the goat is dispatched quickly the blood
sZ12W9uqxR4,378160,380000,is drained then the skin is carefully
sZ12W9uqxR4,380000,381520,removed
sZ12W9uqxR4,381520,383520,the organs and innards are extracted and
sZ12W9uqxR4,383520,385440,laid out on a banana leaf the goat
sZ12W9uqxR4,385440,387680,itself is propped up on a wood rod and
sZ12W9uqxR4,387680,391039,moved to the roasting pit
sZ12W9uqxR4,392639,394800,right now we have the whole goat splayed
sZ12W9uqxR4,394800,396639,out on a spit here the first step here
sZ12W9uqxR4,396639,398080,is they're taking the appendages they're
sZ12W9uqxR4,398080,400000,using leaves to actually tie them closer
sZ12W9uqxR4,400000,401840,to the body they're too far away they're
sZ12W9uqxR4,401840,403039,going to get close to the fire they're
sZ12W9uqxR4,403039,404479,going to burn and just be charred to a
sZ12W9uqxR4,404479,406160,crisp we don't want that more or less we
sZ12W9uqxR4,406160,407680,want everything to cook evenly so
sZ12W9uqxR4,407680,408880,they're going to get the legs tied up
sZ12W9uqxR4,408880,410080,and then from there it's just going to
sZ12W9uqxR4,410080,411919,rotate until it's all the way cooked
sZ12W9uqxR4,411919,413280,through what's really unique about this
sZ12W9uqxR4,413280,415520,style is you don't usually see roasting
sZ12W9uqxR4,415520,417039,done this way usually the head would be
sZ12W9uqxR4,417039,418960,taken clean off even the legs and the
sZ12W9uqxR4,418960,420639,hooves would be cut off but here this is
sZ12W9uqxR4,420639,422319,their traditional way of presenting it
sZ12W9uqxR4,422319,424960,even the ball sack is still there they
sZ12W9uqxR4,424960,429120,skinned the whole animal except for
sZ12W9uqxR4,429120,430639,i'm not sure if we eat the sack we'll
sZ12W9uqxR4,430639,432560,see you soon to add flavor a simple
sZ12W9uqxR4,432560,435280,combination of salt and lemon juice now
sZ12W9uqxR4,435280,437520,the painful part basting the goat and
sZ12W9uqxR4,437520,439599,rotating every few minutes so it cooks
sZ12W9uqxR4,439599,442160,through evenly this process can take up
sZ12W9uqxR4,442160,445199,to three hours
sZ12W9uqxR4,445280,446639,so while the goat is cooking i want to
sZ12W9uqxR4,446639,449680,give you a little bit of a house tour
sZ12W9uqxR4,449680,451360,around this mountain you won't find a
sZ12W9uqxR4,451360,453520,traditional centralized village he has a
sZ12W9uqxR4,453520,455199,complex of a few different houses
sZ12W9uqxR4,455199,456639,because a few different people live here
sZ12W9uqxR4,456639,458720,instead each separate household lives
sZ12W9uqxR4,458720,461280,emits its own banana garden bananas are
sZ12W9uqxR4,461280,463120,an essential crop here from daily
sZ12W9uqxR4,463120,464800,cooking to making an assortment of
sZ12W9uqxR4,464800,467360,beverages or selling them for extra cash
sZ12W9uqxR4,467360,469120,and then he's got tons and tons of
sZ12W9uqxR4,469120,471520,animals besides fruits the banana stocks
sZ12W9uqxR4,471520,473759,allow chaga people to raise a variety of
sZ12W9uqxR4,473759,476240,animals even without grazing lands in
sZ12W9uqxR4,476240,478080,here a couple of cows and this is where
sZ12W9uqxR4,478080,480240,he's feeding them the banana tree so the
sZ12W9uqxR4,480240,482160,tree is soft it's supple you can
sZ12W9uqxR4,482160,484160,actually slash it up quite easily and
sZ12W9uqxR4,484160,486080,put it in here in this wooden trough and
sZ12W9uqxR4,486080,488080,they just they eat
sZ12W9uqxR4,488080,490400,despite its simple exterior inside this
sZ12W9uqxR4,490400,492879,animal house you'll find a whole zoo and
sZ12W9uqxR4,492879,494879,here are the calves eating the same
sZ12W9uqxR4,494879,496560,thing they have rabbits and they have
sZ12W9uqxR4,496560,498080,little baby rabbits over here it's
sZ12W9uqxR4,498080,499919,freaking adorable but don't get too
sZ12W9uqxR4,499919,501440,attached because these animals are not
sZ12W9uqxR4,501440,504560,pets they're food and dogs the dogs are
sZ12W9uqxR4,504560,507360,not pets they're also not food these are
sZ12W9uqxR4,507360,509919,alarm dogs and that's not all and here
sZ12W9uqxR4,509919,512240,even more animals you may recall they
sZ12W9uqxR4,512240,514560,also have goats unfortunately there is
sZ12W9uqxR4,514560,516479,one less goat here now but he's still
sZ12W9uqxR4,516479,518560,got like uh eight nine ten goats part of
sZ12W9uqxR4,518560,520560,sustaining animals and crops here the
sZ12W9uqxR4,520560,522880,rich volcanic soil beneath our feet
sZ12W9uqxR4,522880,524880,second is the knowledge accumulated and
sZ12W9uqxR4,524880,526959,passed down through generations this is
sZ12W9uqxR4,526959,529200,a very specific geography and climate
sZ12W9uqxR4,529200,531279,which requires a very specific way of
sZ12W9uqxR4,531279,533519,life what's so unique about this area is
sZ12W9uqxR4,533519,535200,that it's built on a mountaintop they
sZ12W9uqxR4,535200,537519,don't have room for a huge pen or a huge
sZ12W9uqxR4,537519,539360,pasture and so they've had to literally
sZ12W9uqxR4,539360,541440,build a pen here out of wood and this is
sZ12W9uqxR4,541440,543040,where they hang out all day they've got
sZ12W9uqxR4,543040,546560,their food here what else do you need
sZ12W9uqxR4,546560,548640,while i was touring his home tedeos was
sZ12W9uqxR4,548640,550720,making use of the goat's prized organs
sZ12W9uqxR4,550720,552800,to create a local favorite the goat's
sZ12W9uqxR4,552800,555120,innards are boiled with salt to create a
sZ12W9uqxR4,555120,557600,potent broth before eating you must add
sZ12W9uqxR4,557600,559600,one more ingredient you won't find at
sZ12W9uqxR4,559600,561200,any restaurant
sZ12W9uqxR4,561200,562800,yes in here the preparations are
sZ12W9uqxR4,562800,564800,underway for the goat goats on the fire
sZ12W9uqxR4,564800,567120,but here we're about to try something
sZ12W9uqxR4,567120,568640,i've never seen before i mean i've tried
sZ12W9uqxR4,568640,570399,a lot of blood dishes but nothing like
sZ12W9uqxR4,570399,571920,what you're about to show me now can you
sZ12W9uqxR4,571920,575200,just tell me how this works
sZ12W9uqxR4,575200,577760,now so the size of this we add just a
sZ12W9uqxR4,577760,578720,little
sZ12W9uqxR4,578720,580000,not not much yeah it's just a little bit
sZ12W9uqxR4,580000,582320,of rubber just a little like this
sZ12W9uqxR4,582320,583680,still a decent amount so now we are
sZ12W9uqxR4,583680,585839,going to take the soup we call it white
sZ12W9uqxR4,585839,588399,soup right it's like a white milky broth
sZ12W9uqxR4,588399,590720,combining all the organs and the fats so
sZ12W9uqxR4,590720,592800,that gets dumped into the blood and that
sZ12W9uqxR4,592800,595360,is steaming hot like boiling you can see
sZ12W9uqxR4,595360,597680,how changing very very slowly from red
sZ12W9uqxR4,597680,599440,to brown when they change that means
sZ12W9uqxR4,599440,601279,they're ready to be consumed so you
sZ12W9uqxR4,601279,603440,don't eat raw blood ever no all right
sZ12W9uqxR4,603440,605839,let's try it
sZ12W9uqxR4,608640,610560,that is potent it reminds me of many
sZ12W9uqxR4,610560,612640,dishes i've had in asia like a fav broth
sZ12W9uqxR4,612640,614240,something that's just very deep in
sZ12W9uqxR4,614240,617040,flavor it's really incredible
sZ12W9uqxR4,617040,618959,because of its concentrated amounts of
sZ12W9uqxR4,618959,620959,salt and minerals you can most often
sZ12W9uqxR4,620959,623120,find locals eating this dish on a sunday
sZ12W9uqxR4,623120,624800,morning when they have a hangover right
sZ12W9uqxR4,624800,626240,now he's got some stomach over here he's
sZ12W9uqxR4,626240,627600,gonna slice that into little bitty
sZ12W9uqxR4,627600,629360,pieces oh you put it in the soup all
sZ12W9uqxR4,629360,632240,right let's try it out
sZ12W9uqxR4,632240,634000,oh man it's a really good texture that's
sZ12W9uqxR4,634000,635519,pretty good stomach stomach is tough for
sZ12W9uqxR4,635519,636959,me because some people are really good
sZ12W9uqxR4,636959,638640,at making stomach some people they're
sZ12W9uqxR4,638640,640399,not and when they're not it can get
sZ12W9uqxR4,640399,644000,really bad this is quite delicious
sZ12W9uqxR4,644399,645920,even when you were younger is this the
sZ12W9uqxR4,645920,647519,way you would prepare a goat the head is
sZ12W9uqxR4,647519,649680,there the legs are there so we do that
sZ12W9uqxR4,649680,651680,in example in special events when is the
sZ12W9uqxR4,651680,653200,last time you did it this way one year
sZ12W9uqxR4,653200,655519,ago so really for special occasions very
sZ12W9uqxR4,655519,657360,very very special why do you keep the
sZ12W9uqxR4,657360,659040,head and why do you keep the whole body
sZ12W9uqxR4,659040,660560,together for example if i want to give
sZ12W9uqxR4,660560,663040,somebody christ i need him to see
sZ12W9uqxR4,663040,664800,everything now you see that is a god
sZ12W9uqxR4,664800,668000,because you can see the evidence
sZ12W9uqxR4,668000,670800,heart kidney stomach lungs this soup
sZ12W9uqxR4,670800,673200,contains almost all of the goat's organs
sZ12W9uqxR4,673200,676959,except for one the goat liver
sZ12W9uqxR4,676959,679040,that was saved for the fire then they
sZ12W9uqxR4,679040,680959,wrap it with coal fat and grill it until
sZ12W9uqxR4,680959,683360,the fat melts creating an epic flavor
sZ12W9uqxR4,683360,685519,shell we've had roasted liver before and
sZ12W9uqxR4,685519,687440,in many places here in africa even in
sZ12W9uqxR4,687440,689040,egypt it's very common that they cook
sZ12W9uqxR4,689040,690560,the liver straight away what makes this
sZ12W9uqxR4,690560,692240,especially unique though is that they've
sZ12W9uqxR4,692240,694720,wrapped the liver in coal fat a big thin
sZ12W9uqxR4,694720,696959,membrane of fat that is kind of usually
sZ12W9uqxR4,696959,698880,wrapped around all the organs and stuff
sZ12W9uqxR4,698880,700480,oh thank you all right so we all got a
sZ12W9uqxR4,700480,703760,piece cheers oh wow right away there's a
sZ12W9uqxR4,703760,706320,strong hint of goatiness i love goat but
sZ12W9uqxR4,706320,707920,if you don't like goat you will not like
sZ12W9uqxR4,707920,709600,this but then just beyond that sometimes
sZ12W9uqxR4,709600,710560,when you eat liver that's not been
sZ12W9uqxR4,710560,712399,prepared very well it can like dry your
sZ12W9uqxR4,712399,714160,mouth while you're eating but not this
sZ12W9uqxR4,714160,716240,this it's moist already plus i wrap the
sZ12W9uqxR4,716240,718320,fat around it too so it's kind of juicy
sZ12W9uqxR4,718320,721360,and fatty at the same time
sZ12W9uqxR4,721839,723190,delicious i love it
sZ12W9uqxR4,723190,729279,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,729279,731200,while the goat continues to roast we're
sZ12W9uqxR4,731200,734560,heading to the local market
sZ12W9uqxR4,735600,737680,so it turns out we have almost
sZ12W9uqxR4,737680,739120,everything we need except for a few
sZ12W9uqxR4,739120,740320,ingredients so we're headed to the
sZ12W9uqxR4,740320,742399,market right now to buy some vegetables
sZ12W9uqxR4,742399,745839,and a few other things
sZ12W9uqxR4,748330,750000,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,750000,752720,my men yes men so we have meat we have a
sZ12W9uqxR4,752720,754160,lot of meat there's one more dish you
sZ12W9uqxR4,754160,755360,want to make though with vegetables
sZ12W9uqxR4,755360,758959,right what's that called kitalolo
sZ12W9uqxR4,758959,760560,i feel like i'm in jamaica again what do
sZ12W9uqxR4,760560,762160,we need from here from here we need
sZ12W9uqxR4,762160,764160,vegetables some carrots yeah we need
sZ12W9uqxR4,764160,766079,also some tomatoes does it look like
sZ12W9uqxR4,766079,768320,roma tomatoes do we have everything i
sZ12W9uqxR4,768320,770639,think
sZ12W9uqxR4,770959,772560,i'm surprised that you need to go to a
sZ12W9uqxR4,772560,774079,market at all because you're such a
sZ12W9uqxR4,774079,775440,renaissance fan you have everything at
sZ12W9uqxR4,775440,777040,your house so when you do need to buy
sZ12W9uqxR4,777040,778240,something what kind of stuff are you
sZ12W9uqxR4,778240,780079,usually buying for the market we must
sZ12W9uqxR4,780079,782639,buy sugar salt cooking oil some stuff
sZ12W9uqxR4,782639,783839,like that you can't even make your own
sZ12W9uqxR4,783839,786399,cooking oil no way not yet no because we
sZ12W9uqxR4,786399,788240,have a good infrastructure i mean the
sZ12W9uqxR4,788240,790079,road yeah we can get everything straight
sZ12W9uqxR4,790079,792079,here but before it was very very
sZ12W9uqxR4,792079,793440,difficult how long have you had a paved
sZ12W9uqxR4,793440,795680,road like this not more than five years
sZ12W9uqxR4,795680,798079,i think wow yes but this area still
sZ12W9uqxR4,798079,800320,doesn't have electricity do they only
sZ12W9uqxR4,800320,802160,one year that is very very new wow
sZ12W9uqxR4,802160,803900,that's wild
sZ12W9uqxR4,803900,809570,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,809920,811920,all right so preparation is underway
sZ12W9uqxR4,811920,813600,it's a long bit of preparation for today
sZ12W9uqxR4,813600,815279,the goat is taking much longer than i
sZ12W9uqxR4,815279,817760,thought it's now on our four maybe there
sZ12W9uqxR4,817760,818959,may be nothing left by the time it's
sZ12W9uqxR4,818959,820480,done roasting it'll just be a snack like
sZ12W9uqxR4,820480,821519,a crouton
sZ12W9uqxR4,821519,823199,right here can i see this she's just
sZ12W9uqxR4,823199,825199,broken open a nut i've never seen this
sZ12W9uqxR4,825199,826959,kind of nut before
sZ12W9uqxR4,826959,829199,this is an oyster nut also known as a
sZ12W9uqxR4,829199,831120,queen's nut they come from berries that
sZ12W9uqxR4,831120,833360,can weigh up to 30 pounds they can be
sZ12W9uqxR4,833360,835519,used to create nut oil or they can be
sZ12W9uqxR4,835519,838000,eaten raw oh as an added benefit they're
sZ12W9uqxR4,838000,839680,absolutely delicious i don't know what
sZ12W9uqxR4,839680,841120,that is but it's really good it reminds
sZ12W9uqxR4,841120,842800,me of a brazil nut but it's flat
sZ12W9uqxR4,842800,844240,something between a brazil nut and like
sZ12W9uqxR4,844240,846880,a water chestnut it's really good
sZ12W9uqxR4,846880,848959,so she's grating nuts and she's kind of
sZ12W9uqxR4,848959,851040,grating the leafy greens and look at the
sZ12W9uqxR4,851040,852720,way she does it it's incredible because
sZ12W9uqxR4,852720,854160,she just does everything by hand there's
sZ12W9uqxR4,854160,855680,no cutting board they just take the food
sZ12W9uqxR4,855680,858079,by hand usually stand over a bucket or a
sZ12W9uqxR4,858079,860560,bowl and they do it in their hand
sZ12W9uqxR4,860560,861839,here they have a very unique dish that
sZ12W9uqxR4,861839,863600,i'm very excited about because i'm
sZ12W9uqxR4,863600,865600,hoping it's going to defy expectations
sZ12W9uqxR4,865600,867519,once again this soup is called matcha
sZ12W9uqxR4,867519,869040,lari a traditional dish from the
sZ12W9uqxR4,869040,871199,kilimanjaro region usually it's made
sZ12W9uqxR4,871199,873199,from bananas and beef but today they'll
sZ12W9uqxR4,873199,876000,swap that for goat organs and intestines
sZ12W9uqxR4,876000,878320,boiled with bananas onions garlic
sZ12W9uqxR4,878320,880399,carrots and tomatoes until it all
sZ12W9uqxR4,880399,882240,becomes a mouth-watering stew all right
sZ12W9uqxR4,882240,883760,so here i got some of the broth i have a
sZ12W9uqxR4,883760,886399,big piece of banana let's try it out
sZ12W9uqxR4,886399,888720,wow super savory little bit gaming
sZ12W9uqxR4,888720,890800,slightly goaty broth the banana is
sZ12W9uqxR4,890800,893040,almost like a cassava just super starchy
sZ12W9uqxR4,893040,894720,very potatoy and then they have
sZ12W9uqxR4,894720,898160,intestines liver fats heart lungs i
sZ12W9uqxR4,898160,899519,think i should share would you be

sZ12W9uqxR4,921920,923680,it's been boiling for a very long time
sZ12W9uqxR4,923680,925279,so it's not like that usual kind of
sZ12W9uqxR4,925279,927519,squiddy toughness or chewiness it was
sZ12W9uqxR4,927519,929440,kind of soft and almost milky that's a
sZ12W9uqxR4,929440,931279,unique intestinal experience that's
sZ12W9uqxR4,931279,932800,pretty good all right so this is kind of
sZ12W9uqxR4,932800,934240,our appetizer i don't know how many
sZ12W9uqxR4,934240,935680,appetizers i've had today this is just
sZ12W9uqxR4,935680,937600,basically holding us over until that
sZ12W9uqxR4,937600,940079,goat gets dehydrated down to a crisp so
sZ12W9uqxR4,940079,941600,i'm very curious how that's going to
sZ12W9uqxR4,941600,945600,taste i'm going to find out very soon
sZ12W9uqxR4,945839,947680,moment has finally come they've taken
sZ12W9uqxR4,947680,949680,the goat off of the spit we need to take
sZ12W9uqxR4,949680,951680,it to the eating area but look at this
sZ12W9uqxR4,951680,954800,thing this looks glorious a whole goat
sZ12W9uqxR4,954800,958079,head feet everything right now headed to
sZ12W9uqxR4,958079,961279,the dinner table let's go
sZ12W9uqxR4,967440,968880,we've climbed the mountain we've come up
sZ12W9uqxR4,968880,969920,here they've got the goat they're
sZ12W9uqxR4,969920,972000,putting it on the table and this part is
sZ12W9uqxR4,972000,973360,a little bit dangerous because these
sZ12W9uqxR4,973360,975759,legs are well done oh they're breaking
sZ12W9uqxR4,975759,978320,off okay that's okay everything's okay
sZ12W9uqxR4,978320,979759,all right they're removing the wire from

sZ12W9uqxR4,1008320,1010639,whole goat there's no question i look at
sZ12W9uqxR4,1010639,1012720,this and i'm not like is that a kangaroo

sZ12W9uqxR4,1022800,1025360,excited about shall we yeah now this is
sZ12W9uqxR4,1025360,1027038,roasted a little differently than any
sZ12W9uqxR4,1027038,1028798,goat i've seen before because it was not
sZ12W9uqxR4,1028798,1030720,basted they maybe put some lemon on it
sZ12W9uqxR4,1030720,1032160,in the beginning but there was nothing
sZ12W9uqxR4,1032160,1034079,to kind of keep moisture inside and i'm
sZ12W9uqxR4,1034079,1035678,wondering if it's going to be dry what's
sZ12W9uqxR4,1035678,1037120,it going to be like oh that's a big
sZ12W9uqxR4,1037120,1040240,piece let's go for it
sZ12W9uqxR4,1041839,1043360,that goat is delicious i thought it
sZ12W9uqxR4,1043360,1045038,would be really dried out because it
sZ12W9uqxR4,1045038,1047038,shrunk by half the size while it was
sZ12W9uqxR4,1047038,1048640,roasting it's really just a little bit
sZ12W9uqxR4,1048640,1050880,crispy on the outside and then really
sZ12W9uqxR4,1050880,1053280,soft and juicy and just full of goatee
sZ12W9uqxR4,1053280,1055600,flavor
sZ12W9uqxR4,1055919,1058080,almost really yummy
sZ12W9uqxR4,1058080,1059520,all right right here we have a piece of
sZ12W9uqxR4,1059520,1061039,the neck meat you know some places
sZ12W9uqxR4,1061039,1062480,around the world if you're eating sheep
sZ12W9uqxR4,1062480,1064320,neck it's actually a delicacy we had
sZ12W9uqxR4,1064320,1066160,something like that in iran and you can
sZ12W9uqxR4,1066160,1068030,see why this is so soft let's try it out
sZ12W9uqxR4,1068030,1069200,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,1069200,1072880,it's that protein juiciness so good
sZ12W9uqxR4,1072880,1074320,that's delicious and i want to keep
sZ12W9uqxR4,1074320,1075600,eating that forever but here we have a
sZ12W9uqxR4,1075600,1077600,vegetable too what is this this dish is
sZ12W9uqxR4,1077600,1080000,known as kita lolo it starts with naofu
sZ12W9uqxR4,1080000,1082160,and kilodermal the chopped local greens
sZ12W9uqxR4,1082160,1084480,we saw earlier
sZ12W9uqxR4,1084480,1086640,add sliced bananas and grated oyster
sZ12W9uqxR4,1086640,1088640,nuts then it gets a little bit funky
sZ12W9uqxR4,1088640,1091360,they mix soda ash with water and pour it
sZ12W9uqxR4,1091360,1093039,in
sZ12W9uqxR4,1093039,1096240,cook it until everything softens up
sZ12W9uqxR4,1096240,1098080,and finish with sour milk that's been
sZ12W9uqxR4,1098080,1100910,fermenting for two to three days
sZ12W9uqxR4,1100910,1104029,[Music]
sZ12W9uqxR4,1104160,1107960,all right i'm gonna try it out
sZ12W9uqxR4,1109039,1111120,i can feel the grated nuts i taste the
sZ12W9uqxR4,1111120,1112799,greens it's a little spinachy but like a
sZ12W9uqxR4,1112799,1114000,little bitter and then there's just a
sZ12W9uqxR4,1114000,1115840,hint of sourness from the milk but it's
sZ12W9uqxR4,1115840,1117200,not off-putting it doesn't feel
sZ12W9uqxR4,1117200,1119039,especially dairy-like it just feels like
sZ12W9uqxR4,1119039,1120480,something in here is a bit fermented
sZ12W9uqxR4,1120480,1122640,that is because of that sour milk wow
sZ12W9uqxR4,1122640,1124559,does this milk come from your cows and
sZ12W9uqxR4,1124559,1126320,you keep it in a container until it
sZ12W9uqxR4,1126320,1128320,turns sour the ferment yeah how many
sZ12W9uqxR4,1128320,1129919,days does the milk form two to three
sZ12W9uqxR4,1129919,1132159,days
sZ12W9uqxR4,1133440,1135200,last thing beer made from bananas

sZ12W9uqxR4,1145440,1149399,tossed in a hollow log
sZ12W9uqxR4,1150480,1152480,then crushed with dry grass to squeeze
sZ12W9uqxR4,1152480,1156240,out and filter the juice inside
sZ12W9uqxR4,1157120,1159200,the banana juice is mixed with millet
sZ12W9uqxR4,1159200,1161120,flour then left to ferment for just a
sZ12W9uqxR4,1161120,1163120,few days after that you have a drink
sZ12W9uqxR4,1163120,1165679,that is super calorie dense plus it'll
