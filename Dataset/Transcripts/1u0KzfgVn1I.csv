1u0KzfgVn1I,12639,19039,backend jobs  vital to keeping the industry afloat  sorry to laugh it's not funny also don't
1u0KzfgVn1I,19039,25640,forget to subscribe to the british vogue  youtube channel or you might miss out
1u0KzfgVn1I,25870,33680,[Music]  i moved to new york in 2009 to host an
1u0KzfgVn1I,33680,39120,mtv chat show basically and  inadvertently ended up becoming more
1u0KzfgVn1I,39120,46079,involved in fashion just through living  here it's literally if you can make it  there you can make it anywhere
1u0KzfgVn1I,46079,51280,the energy here is really high octane  people work until midnight and get up at
1u0KzfgVn1I,51280,57199,five to go to the gym before they go to  work again i think it was just a bit of  a shock when i got here that that was
1u0KzfgVn1I,57199,63039,the way of life plus i had no mates  [Music]  it is somewhere where you can get things
1u0KzfgVn1I,63039,68960,done if you have an idea someone else  will help you realize that um dream as
1u0KzfgVn1I,68960,74720,it were  if you come here and you're feeling a  bit like oh i don't know if this is  going to work you can be buoyed up by
1u0KzfgVn1I,74720,80080,people here because they're so  enthusiastic and positive  yeah let's do it you want to do a pants
1u0KzfgVn1I,80080,89870,line fantastic  everyone's so friendly  [Laughter]
1u0KzfgVn1I,91040,96240,so i was like totally reading your  feedback from series one and loads of
1u0KzfgVn1I,96240,103600,people requested more of an insight into  the business of fashion so i thought duh  we should totally go to new york
1u0KzfgVn1I,103600,111520,i mean if london is all about the art  and paris is couture new york city is  surely all about the money baby renowned
1u0KzfgVn1I,111520,118159,for being a city of workaholics it's one  that has produced some of the most  progressive minds the world of  management communications and retail has
1u0KzfgVn1I,118159,124159,ever seen we're kicking off in one of my  favorite parts of town soho where i  frequently partake in one of my favorite
1u0KzfgVn1I,124159,129599,pastimes chocky sorry i mean shopping  they're kind of the same thing actually  but one's way more expensive that's
1u0KzfgVn1I,129599,136160,jogging of course because the  accessories and nutrition bar  derivatives are way out of control these  days anyway lindsay butler started her
1u0KzfgVn1I,136160,142720,boutique leather store in 2008 she runs  vader from her studio showroom and  storefront in the heart of soho and
1u0KzfgVn1I,142720,148959,somehow manages to juggle both running  the business and leading the design team  side by side i'm pretty sure she hasn't
1u0KzfgVn1I,148959,154640,slept since 2005. hello  so what what are people doing right now
1u0KzfgVn1I,154640,160239,they're making samples and then actually  i think that they're working on we've  been we did these little uh baby jackets
1u0KzfgVn1I,160239,166480,so i think we're making a few extra bits  you're doing baby leathers yeah they're  really cute  that's pretty yeah i feel like i might
1u0KzfgVn1I,166480,172900,one day turn into a creepy weird lady  that doesn't have any children but just  collects children's clothes  and strokes them at night one day
1u0KzfgVn1I,172900,178319,[Music]  can you start by telling us what you
1u0KzfgVn1I,178319,185120,think your job title is and how many you  have because you have a lot of slashes  going sure i've sort of defined it more
1u0KzfgVn1I,185120,190640,recently as like i think i'm more like a  creative director role and then  definitely ceo that's also a big one for
1u0KzfgVn1I,190640,195840,me but of course i do like  i do fitting yes i do
1u0KzfgVn1I,195840,201440,i don't know i feel like i do a little  bit of everything when you were younger  did you  have a set goal did you think oh one day
1u0KzfgVn1I,201440,207040,i want to be the ceo of my own company i  actually did i really wanted to like own  my own company i did not know that it
1u0KzfgVn1I,207040,214239,was a fashion company i was just like i  want to be my own boss that was really  important to me you came from the  business side and you you you definitely
1u0KzfgVn1I,214239,221360,excelled in that because i read a quote  from you in an interview where you were  saying  that  so much of what you do encompasses so
1u0KzfgVn1I,221360,226799,many different things so you'll be doing  uh the creative but also you'll be you  know have your head in the middle of
1u0KzfgVn1I,226799,233200,spreadsheets as well which you actually  might enjoy more yeah i definitely like  them both a lot and i think i might
1u0KzfgVn1I,233200,239360,enjoy the business side a little bit  more  what did you study at university um  philosophy and religion
1u0KzfgVn1I,239360,244400,so nice yeah how does that play into  what you do now i think it helps with
1u0KzfgVn1I,244400,249920,like thought processes and like how i  process information and  a lot of like studying philosophy is
1u0KzfgVn1I,249920,255519,like basing your arguments on things so  yeah i don't know how that helps exactly  with work but i feel like maybe it just
1u0KzfgVn1I,255519,261680,helps me organize my thoughts in a way  just because this program is based on  feedback and questions from the audience
1u0KzfgVn1I,261680,266720,that might be watching it and  a lot of our comments were about how
1u0KzfgVn1I,266720,274400,to parlay your degree into a job in the  fashion industry and people are  concerned if they study uh law or
1u0KzfgVn1I,274400,280800,science or politics or whatever that it  won't be relevant to the industry but it  absolutely is i also think like a lot of
1u0KzfgVn1I,280800,287520,like liberal arts degrees in general are  just kind of like about teaching  yourself like how to be diligent doing  work and how to how to think and how to
1u0KzfgVn1I,287520,292560,work with other people and sort of how  to relate to the world and i feel like  that's a lot of what i learned at school
1u0KzfgVn1I,292560,299199,as well like just how to kind of be in  the world on your own yeah things like  that you just have to want to work  really hard and pick up things as you go
1u0KzfgVn1I,299199,305520,along because we were talking as well  about  whether business acumen is something  that you can that can be learned or
1u0KzfgVn1I,305520,311759,whether you think that's inherent to  people and then they become successful  business people gosh i don't know i kind  of think it's a little bit of both like
1u0KzfgVn1I,311759,317680,i feel like  i'm good at it so but i don't know if  that's something that's like innate i  definitely learned things along the way
1u0KzfgVn1I,317680,323280,like i'm still learning how to be a good  boss and a manager and a leader i feel  like it's all can be learned but i think
1u0KzfgVn1I,323280,330639,maybe for some people it's easier than  other people  when can i buy this may may yep this
1u0KzfgVn1I,330639,336160,this  everything  so brilliant
1u0KzfgVn1I,336160,341199,this is just the best thing ever yeah  that's really fun  how much is that going to be i think
1u0KzfgVn1I,341199,346479,like 300 how do you decide how much  something should cost  so you have to kind of work backwards
1u0KzfgVn1I,346479,352240,from what it actually costs to make and  then you have to build in like a  wholesale  markup because they have to sell to the
1u0KzfgVn1I,352240,357360,stores first and then they have to mark  it up to retail at their kind of  standard usually it's from wholesale to
1u0KzfgVn1I,357360,364400,retail it's like 2.2 and does your store  price reflect that of  yeah so i do the same retail price just
1u0KzfgVn1I,364400,370400,to be considerate to my stores but  sometimes we'll make like one-off  products or we have a small collection
1u0KzfgVn1I,370400,375600,called the mercer collection that we  sell just in the store  and that is kind of for us a fun way to
1u0KzfgVn1I,375600,382370,test new styles but also to get in like  a lower price point jacket because we  can just make them and put them directly  in this i think there's no middleman
1u0KzfgVn1I,382370,389520,[Music]  you didn't have your stool to begin with
1u0KzfgVn1I,389520,397120,no  started doing wholesale to begin with  and then moved into retail and how  important do you think retail is now
1u0KzfgVn1I,397120,403440,because i know that you have an ipad in  your shop and people can still  incorporate the e-commerce thing into it
1u0KzfgVn1I,403440,409840,so do you think it's still relevant to  have a retail space i do i think i kind  of went back and forth maybe like three
1u0KzfgVn1I,409840,415440,years after i started the brand i had i  opened a store on ludlow and i had that  for about a year and a half i really  wanted to have that touchstone with the
1u0KzfgVn1I,415440,420560,customer and i think for that reason  alone it's really important like i hear  such awesome feedback from the store
1u0KzfgVn1I,420560,426319,like oh the buckle on that jacket is  like makes a lot of noise and people  keep not buying it because the
1u0KzfgVn1I,426319,432479,like the buckle's jingly and i was like  is the music not loud enough in the  store like why is that happening but  that's not something i've ever heard
1u0KzfgVn1I,432479,437759,from like a wholesale account but yeah  that's great we got a new buckle now so  yeah it won't happen anymore i don't
1u0KzfgVn1I,437759,444479,think i would i think it would have  taken a lot longer to like get that  information  do you have advice for
1u0KzfgVn1I,444479,449919,anyone watching that wants to set up  their own business something that you  wish you'd been told before you embarked
1u0KzfgVn1I,449919,456080,on this journey i think just in general  understanding that you kind of need to  have both that creative side and a
1u0KzfgVn1I,456080,461360,business acumen  it really i mean so if you don't have  that if you're just creative and you  make beautiful things like that's
1u0KzfgVn1I,461360,467680,amazing find somebody that you can  partner with that does have that  i think i think partnering i think like
1u0KzfgVn1I,467680,474160,mentors i think asking questions and not  thinking you know everything like the  sooner you can learn that like i think  the better off you'll be so i think
1u0KzfgVn1I,474160,479360,asking for help and finding the right  people to work with is really important
1u0KzfgVn1I,479360,485599,and that my dear f offers is what a  multi-tasking wonder woman looks like as  lindsay says the right help is key and a
1u0KzfgVn1I,485599,490800,strong partnership can help build the  foundations for enterprise joseph  altazara found the ying to his fashion
1u0KzfgVn1I,490800,496639,yang with ceo charis derma after  launching his eponymous women's wear  line in 2008
1u0KzfgVn1I,496639,505089,the rest is beautiful history  [Music]
1u0KzfgVn1I,506080,512880,i really felt that i had taken it as far  as i could um and that i needed a
1u0KzfgVn1I,512880,518640,partner  within the company to help me think  about things differently to help take it
1u0KzfgVn1I,518640,524399,somewhere that i didn't feel i could  take it on my own  it's a it's a long process trying to
1u0KzfgVn1I,524399,530959,find that person we really talked about  the type of company that we wanted to  create if we could work together and the
1u0KzfgVn1I,530959,536080,environment that we thought was great  joseph had a lot of experience working  at different types of fashion companies
1u0KzfgVn1I,536080,543760,and had a really strong point of view  and i felt that  you know he was very mature and very  wise i don't uh pretend to have every
1u0KzfgVn1I,543760,549920,answer i don't want to have every answer  but my job is to help joseph um build  his team and then to build out the rest
1u0KzfgVn1I,549920,556720,of the organization so that they can  provide the answers and that the group  as a collective can can help sort of the
1u0KzfgVn1I,556720,562560,best ideas rise to the top  when you're looking for new team members  what's been some of the harder
1u0KzfgVn1I,562560,568080,roles to fill  recently we spent a long time looking  for a merchandiser and i think
1u0KzfgVn1I,568080,573440,merchandising is a very important  um and sometimes overlooked role in in
1u0KzfgVn1I,573440,581360,an early stage of a company what do they  do  what is the merchandise the merchandiser  is able to sit with the design team
1u0KzfgVn1I,581360,586800,understand what their needs are in the  direction not only of the brand but of  that specific season and
1u0KzfgVn1I,586800,592880,look at the creative director and know  what's making him or her tick that  season but at the same time analytically
1u0KzfgVn1I,592880,599200,understand  where the company is trying to go in  terms of the numbers in terms of the  breadth of the collection key
1u0KzfgVn1I,599200,604320,categorizations and key price points as  we start launching the collection then
1u0KzfgVn1I,604320,609680,there's also a question about like  okay this fabric is like a really
1u0KzfgVn1I,609680,614800,specific kind of dyeing process  so maybe we can do this and it's going
1u0KzfgVn1I,614800,620399,to be expensive but how about we think  about  a more also a more commercial way of
1u0KzfgVn1I,620399,626650,doing it so is it also about doing a  digital print that looks like this  but that could be less expensive
1u0KzfgVn1I,626650,631760,[Music]  i would say to anybody that wants to be
1u0KzfgVn1I,631760,638079,a ceo  um  to think about not only the things that  people you know tell you in terms of
1u0KzfgVn1I,638079,644880,strategy brand building etc etc but i  really think you need to be aware of how  much time you spend with people and
1u0KzfgVn1I,644880,650160,building your team because that is  really i would say 50 of what i do today
1u0KzfgVn1I,650160,656000,um i think in this specific industry  it's also having the awareness that you
1u0KzfgVn1I,656000,661600,will work very closely with your  creative director you'll hold their hand  every step of the way and they'll hold
1u0KzfgVn1I,661600,667360,yours and i think that ceos and other  industries um don't have that partner
1u0KzfgVn1I,667360,673120,sort of you know that is necessary for  growing their business  and i'm particularly lucky
1u0KzfgVn1I,673120,680240,because joseph is such a pleasure to  work with genuinely um but understanding  that as a ceo you need to be sensitive
1u0KzfgVn1I,680240,685360,to them and know how to work with them  and understand what their habits and  patterns and needs are
1u0KzfgVn1I,685360,695680,because that's critical otherwise you  won't be successful as a brand  excellent super lucky oh guys not now
1u0KzfgVn1I,696000,701600,so as you can see there's really no cut  and dried way to structure a managerial  system within a fashion brand it's a
1u0KzfgVn1I,701600,707120,complex world out there but i'm learning  it's very much about finding people who  complement each other's skill sets that
1u0KzfgVn1I,707120,713440,way everyone can bring something to the  table to create one big beautiful  fashion pie it's sort of like free love
1u0KzfgVn1I,713440,720240,but with you know hemlines and  spreadsheets instead of lsd and cuddle  parties but i digress our final meeting
1u0KzfgVn1I,720240,726240,is with perhaps the poster children of  progressive retail presentations umberto  leon and carol lim launched opening
1u0KzfgVn1I,726240,731360,ceremony in 2002 with a manifesto to  combine their passion for art travel and
1u0KzfgVn1I,731360,737600,fashion once a tiny store in downtown  new york they've now gone global and  their conceptual scope is ever shifting
1u0KzfgVn1I,737600,743839,and always innovative also probably  worth a mention in their spare time the  duo have led french fashion house kenzo
1u0KzfgVn1I,743839,749920,to dizzying new heights since taking on  creative director roles  their unrelenting ingenuity and success
1u0KzfgVn1I,749920,757040,almost makes you want to hate them oh   but to make matters worse they're  also really nice people hello hi
1u0KzfgVn1I,757040,768399,i guess we're just gonna have to roll  with it and join the lovin  that's amazing  [Music]
1u0KzfgVn1I,768399,774480,okay  thanks guys  sometimes i think they think i'm  shoplifting in here
1u0KzfgVn1I,774480,777839,they do i bet they do
1u0KzfgVn1I,780880,787279,carol and i actually met at university  at uni at uc berkeley  when we were 18 and um
1u0KzfgVn1I,787279,795200,i studied art  i studied economics perfect  we met i actually worked at retail for
1u0KzfgVn1I,795200,802160,14 years for a long time before  we got into this and then i got  recruited into corporate and i worked
1u0KzfgVn1I,802160,807920,for the gap and then i ended up working  for burberry when they were rebranding  wow i knew that banking kind of finance
1u0KzfgVn1I,807920,813279,wasn't for me and so i was like i want  to live in new york i was like why not  try fashion and it took me actually a
1u0KzfgVn1I,813279,818560,while because everywhere i interviewed  they're like what do you do like  what's mna and you know i had to kind of
1u0KzfgVn1I,818560,825760,explain what i knew how to do and then a  year and a half later it started opening  ceremonies so so can you list some of
1u0KzfgVn1I,825760,832639,the jobs that exist in order to make  this thing run i think people might need  to know that there's like a pr situation
1u0KzfgVn1I,832639,840800,a lawyer  let's do it  ah this is good  [Laughter]
1u0KzfgVn1I,840800,848399,well like i think in my world for  opening ceremony i oversee a lot of what  people call the back office function so
1u0KzfgVn1I,848399,855360,from finance legal i.t hr  logistics um then there's like the
1u0KzfgVn1I,855360,860639,retail operations and the e-commerce  operations there's merchandising and
1u0KzfgVn1I,860639,866800,buying  and then from my end there's the  designing the art department visual
1u0KzfgVn1I,866800,872480,merchandising special projects special  projects  graphic designers
1u0KzfgVn1I,872480,879600,um content team for  web and social media  all in all it's a pretty big brand
1u0KzfgVn1I,879600,885920,that's all the birthdays to keep up with  a lot of birthdays a lot of celebrating  but it actually it's a good question
1u0KzfgVn1I,885920,892720,because i think there's a lot in fashion  that it's not just the creative side  there's a lot of other pieces that you
1u0KzfgVn1I,892720,899440,absolutely need because you could have  all the things  like amazing ideas and then something  legal could be like oh well you just
1u0KzfgVn1I,899440,905839,can't do that idea so i think having  that you know connection with all those  different areas is important what's
1u0KzfgVn1I,905839,911120,interesting is a lot of people that come  to us they come from  a non-fashion field but they're
1u0KzfgVn1I,911120,916560,professionals and as lawyers and things  and they'll come to a talk that we did  and they'll say hey how do i work in
1u0KzfgVn1I,916560,922160,fashion and we said there is a job for  you in fact you just have to find the  right place exactly i'm always amazed as
1u0KzfgVn1I,922160,927199,well by how  cool  all the staff are here and that the shop
1u0KzfgVn1I,927199,933199,assistants are like really up on  everything how what's the interview  process for finding those people well we
1u0KzfgVn1I,933199,940240,generally don't ask them about clothes  we start off with what's your favorite  bands what movies do you love nice it's
1u0KzfgVn1I,940240,945440,a little bit more of a nerdy interview  and i think everyone that interviews  with us always is shocked oh yeah they
1u0KzfgVn1I,945440,952000,get really stumped because they're like  oh my gosh i'm expecting that yeah like  because they say  there's a lot of crazy
1u0KzfgVn1I,952000,959199,has anyone ever cried when you're  interviewing them definitely a lot of  crying panting  needs 15-minute break
1u0KzfgVn1I,959199,966320,that's because you're hiring children  babies  i'm just hiring toddlers it's because we  ask people these personal questions like
1u0KzfgVn1I,966320,972560,name your three favorite bands oh that  is the worst question though when you're  not prepared for it because like you can  think about that all day long and
1u0KzfgVn1I,972560,979279,suddenly you're like  and then you come out with something  like nirvana you're like oh man  and then we get follow-up emails saying
1u0KzfgVn1I,979279,985920,i said that but actually you know what i  wanted to say that's good that's when  you know you've got someone that really  cares about getting this job yeah which
1u0KzfgVn1I,985920,991360,is the other thing but just curious  people that i think have  they want to know and learn things and i
1u0KzfgVn1I,991360,997600,think that translates really well can  you talk to me as well about this retail  space and how important it is to have
1u0KzfgVn1I,997600,1004000,kind of bricks and mortar and how that's  changed as well since you've started for  us it's a really great way for people to
1u0KzfgVn1I,1004000,1009120,experience  the stories we're trying to tell i think  a lot of times
1u0KzfgVn1I,1009120,1015920,you know online  you don't really physically get to touch  things so  for us there's something really really
1u0KzfgVn1I,1015920,1021440,nice about being able to tell the story  of the designers that we carry yeah um i
1u0KzfgVn1I,1021440,1027038,think it's it's really about the  experience what's interesting is i feel  like people use opening ceremony also as
1u0KzfgVn1I,1027038,1033760,a meeting point  so it's also for us what we kind of can  almost see like as a square where people
1u0KzfgVn1I,1033760,1039520,would meet i mean opening ceremony you  see it on the weekends always people are  coming here it's a marketplace yeah
1u0KzfgVn1I,1039520,1045360,let's meet by the potatoes they're  talking and then they'll look at some  clothes here and there and they'll buy  or they'll not buy and yeah i think
1u0KzfgVn1I,1045360,1051919,that's how we've really been able to  make this also a family store because  parents will come in super excited about
1u0KzfgVn1I,1051919,1057760,something that we're launching  bring their kids in or the kids will  bring their parents in and yeah to us
1u0KzfgVn1I,1057760,1063520,that's really exciting i don't there's  not too many stores in fashion that  focus on families i think it's nice that
1u0KzfgVn1I,1063520,1069280,we can  be part of that community and be it a  place for these people yeah in that way
1u0KzfgVn1I,1069280,1074799,i feel like we're interviewing a lot of  uh people in this new york episode but  we were trying to find female ceos to
1u0KzfgVn1I,1074799,1080640,talk about and  there seems to be an imbalance in that  world there seems to be a male dominated
1u0KzfgVn1I,1080640,1087200,profession how do you think that impacts  the industry and do you think it's  changing as well it definitely impacts
1u0KzfgVn1I,1087200,1093919,the industry and whether it's changing  or i think it's a deeply rooted i think  systemic thing that starts pretty early
1u0KzfgVn1I,1093919,1099679,on i think with you know saying are  these jobs even available i don't know  if girls are even taught like oh these
1u0KzfgVn1I,1099679,1104960,are things you can aspire to and i do  think that you know it needs to change  but a lot of it has to do with awareness
1u0KzfgVn1I,1104960,1112480,so it is about talking about it and  creating those paths for women yeah  well this might be inspiring for people
1u0KzfgVn1I,1112480,1118799,that are watching you yeah  i hope so yeah definitely
1u0KzfgVn1I,1120720,1127120,pr or public relations in layman's terms  is a highly competitive industry where  only those with the improbable
1u0KzfgVn1I,1127120,1132559,combination of quick wit organizational  skills and charm will survive
1u0KzfgVn1I,1132559,1138240,one of new york's most progressive pr  agencies black frame is spread over  several floors in the chelsea arts
1u0KzfgVn1I,1138240,1144190,district where a squadron of staff look  after clients that range from kenzo to  nike to the freeze art fair
1u0KzfgVn1I,1144190,1151660,[Music]  and there's a pretty wonderful showroom  on the second floor too
1u0KzfgVn1I,1151660,1158240,[Music]  does it smell of swifty
1u0KzfgVn1I,1158240,1165039,it stinks swift  it smells like angel's hair
1u0KzfgVn1I,1165039,1170720,along with curating an extensive  catalogue of celebrity pheromones chief  executive brian phillips combines his
1u0KzfgVn1I,1170720,1179559,expertise in the areas of fashion film  and art to lead a pr firm that tends to  some of fashion's most inventive brands
1u0KzfgVn1I,1180160,1185919,can you just talk us through how you got  to this point like what did you study at  university i know that you went to
1u0KzfgVn1I,1185919,1191760,college with alberto right well i met  him when i was in college oh he had  already graduated i was here at columbia
1u0KzfgVn1I,1191760,1197600,university  studying architecture and urban studies  which i was interested in being an
1u0KzfgVn1I,1197600,1202720,architect but  famously not good at drawing at all
1u0KzfgVn1I,1202720,1210080,but i loved magazines so that was kind  of my side gig okay so from once you  graduated what was your first uh job i
1u0KzfgVn1I,1210080,1216720,worked at visionnaire i love this idea  of  art and fashion existing in a  publication together and how they were
1u0KzfgVn1I,1216720,1223039,pushing the boundaries of making  magazines and  also loved the idea of kind of being in
1u0KzfgVn1I,1223039,1228559,that kind of a creative environment  getting to know what it was to make a  magazine yeah so that's where i that's
1u0KzfgVn1I,1228559,1235120,where i started and do you think that  editorial eye kind of bleeds into what  you do today yeah the idea of putting
1u0KzfgVn1I,1235120,1240720,together a kind of perspective on some  aspect of the cultural industry or of
1u0KzfgVn1I,1240720,1247200,fashion is something that  has been for sure put into play here  because we know we have a brand too you
1u0KzfgVn1I,1247200,1253039,know clients want to be a part of this  context because it says something about  who they are and what their values are
1u0KzfgVn1I,1253039,1258559,and so can you explain to me what your  business is now and how you got started  well our main business is
1u0KzfgVn1I,1258559,1263840,public relations and image consulting so  we represent clients from fashion like
1u0KzfgVn1I,1263840,1268880,rodarte and kenzo  and opening ceremony to
1u0KzfgVn1I,1268880,1274159,art and design related projects like  freeze art fair  standard hotels so it kind of cuts
1u0KzfgVn1I,1274159,1281120,across all these different sectors of  what like-minded people might be  interested in when we represent a brand
1u0KzfgVn1I,1281120,1286880,it's a kind of 360 look at everything  that they're doing so it's  the way that they're advertising
1u0KzfgVn1I,1286880,1293840,themselves the way that they're  dressing cool girls and guys  relationships with editors and magazines
1u0KzfgVn1I,1293840,1299360,and writers you know we're their  ambassador to the world in a way and  find a way of
1u0KzfgVn1I,1299360,1306018,doing that in interesting and  unconventional ways sometimes  [Music]
1u0KzfgVn1I,1306640,1312320,can you give us an example of how you've  managed to um  kind of put those things together well
1u0KzfgVn1I,1312320,1319280,with opening ceremony a big project that  they did last year was this development  of the mika bracelet with intel
1u0KzfgVn1I,1319280,1326720,so that was a really interesting  foray into wearable tech  when we were challenged here at black
1u0KzfgVn1I,1326720,1332559,frame how to sort of visualize that and  make it compelling as a as a desirable  object
1u0KzfgVn1I,1332559,1338320,that would blend fashion and wearable  tech  kenzo is a great
1u0KzfgVn1I,1338320,1343679,brand that can really have an authentic  voice and independent film  storytelling so that's something that
1u0KzfgVn1I,1343679,1349679,we've kind of  been spearheading for  for the brand and that's a relatively  new
1u0KzfgVn1I,1349679,1356240,situation isn't it so it's no longer a  kind of reality show version of a photo  shoot it can have its own identity
1u0KzfgVn1I,1356240,1362480,entirely absolutely you know people love  music they love film and cats people  love cats i love cats
1u0KzfgVn1I,1362480,1369200,of course that's the other thing um  fashion cats are huge  the last opening ceremony show that i
1u0KzfgVn1I,1369200,1374799,went to when it was models walking along  and then some of them were like one  would fall down
1u0KzfgVn1I,1374799,1380880,the first girl that fell down i was like  oh my god and i was with everyone we  were all sitting there going oh poor  girl that was really embarrassing we
1u0KzfgVn1I,1380880,1386159,kept talking about we're like that is so  embarrassing and then suddenly another  one and i was like oh it's a thing and
1u0KzfgVn1I,1386159,1393039,then they got up and did a dance and i  was like this is me yeah that was like  let's you know turn the sort of um
1u0KzfgVn1I,1393039,1398480,conventions of a show with one of which  is sadly there sometimes falls
1u0KzfgVn1I,1398480,1404080,into something that  surprises people yeah and makes it  memorable opening ceremony is like the
1u0KzfgVn1I,1404080,1410559,best laboratory because they always say  yes to the really big and crazy ideas  yeah that was brilliant though
1u0KzfgVn1I,1410559,1417520,where do you see  uh the future of image making going  what's gonna happen soothsayer yeah i
1u0KzfgVn1I,1417520,1422880,mean photography and fashion are  so inextricable and have been since like
1u0KzfgVn1I,1422880,1429200,avadon and  and irving penn i think fashion is also  looking at other types of image creators
1u0KzfgVn1I,1429200,1435279,and that could be  you know young illustrators or  architects anybody who can create
1u0KzfgVn1I,1435279,1440880,something that's compelling from a  fashion point of view  as an image maker is going to be doing
1u0KzfgVn1I,1440880,1448960,well in the future  [Music]
1u0KzfgVn1I,1448960,1454960,our mission to uncover the real future  of fashion has taken us down some pretty  oblique pathways but our collective turn
1u0KzfgVn1I,1454960,1460559,brand consultants cajole take the  abstraction cake with their highly  conceptual approach to trend definition
1u0KzfgVn1I,1460559,1466559,and cultural observation but how does  this relate to fashion i hear you cry  don't worry i'm confused too
1u0KzfgVn1I,1466559,1473120,in a further twist of elusive genius  they don't even have an irl base so i  had the fought art director fabricate a
1u0KzfgVn1I,1473120,1479039,typical nyc creative space so that we  could meet to discuss their delvings  into the netherworld of speculative
1u0KzfgVn1I,1479039,1487840,saltorialism hello  hi only balls up was i forgot to pack my  dictionary okay here we are for our
1u0KzfgVn1I,1487840,1493919,setup meeting  i hate anything that's not authentic and  therefore i can't act
1u0KzfgVn1I,1493919,1499840,but i can be  i honestly can't
1u0KzfgVn1I,1499840,1506559,years ago we started an artist's project  uh art collective called k-hole with
1u0KzfgVn1I,1506559,1513520,interest in opening up and activating a  space between the art world and the  world of branding and marketing
1u0KzfgVn1I,1513520,1520480,we had all graduated from school and we  were living the space between being  artists and writers and poets and also
1u0KzfgVn1I,1520480,1526400,doing all these commercial jobs for  money so a friend of ours worked at an  agency where they subscribed to these
1u0KzfgVn1I,1526400,1532000,really expensive trend forecasting  reports yeah where you pay as a company  let's say 20k a year and you've got
1u0KzfgVn1I,1532000,1537919,these pdfs with emoticons in them  that have all sorts of pop cultural  theory about young people
1u0KzfgVn1I,1537919,1544720,and we became obsessed with these  reports and basically in the spirit of  fan fiction started k-hole
1u0KzfgVn1I,1544720,1550799,part of the reason we decided to make a  pdf and not a print product is because  it was low overhead so we were paying
1u0KzfgVn1I,1550799,1557039,for it out of our own pockets but it  really wasn't very expensive it was just  our time and of course as things go on  your time gets more and more expensive
1u0KzfgVn1I,1557039,1563840,you have to adjust in different ways and  then for us to get an understanding of  how your business runs like how many do  you have an office now we're basically
1u0KzfgVn1I,1563840,1570559,in a google doc and on the cloud okay  and how many people make up your  collective there are five of us okay so
1u0KzfgVn1I,1570559,1576960,it's like a band  um and we were kind of intentionally  mysterious about who we were
1u0KzfgVn1I,1576960,1584000,because we were nobody  and the  world of the internet started to take us  seriously as not just an art project but
1u0KzfgVn1I,1584000,1589600,also as a marketing and trend  consultancy but you never set out to be  taken seriously it was more kind of a
1u0KzfgVn1I,1589600,1596720,critique on that and then you ended up  actually it being a profitable business  it wasn't a satire like on purpose it
1u0KzfgVn1I,1596720,1603679,wasn't like ad busters or something that  had come before in the 90s we were  trying to demonstrate a much more  ambivalent relationship with commerce
1u0KzfgVn1I,1603679,1609039,and culture and we were also trying to  push our friends  who were artists who were pretending
1u0KzfgVn1I,1609039,1615520,like their lives as consumers were  somehow completely separate from their  art practice right  and that's kind of where we started from
1u0KzfgVn1I,1615520,1621840,but also sort of looking at the actual  language and landscape of trend  forecasting a lot of it seems like super
1u0KzfgVn1I,1621840,1628240,lightweight cultural analysis yeah like  observing something in the most basic  way possible and calling it a trend and
1u0KzfgVn1I,1628240,1635919,we thought it would be a really  interesting opportunity to actually sort  of use the analytics skills that we had  built as writers and artists to take
1u0KzfgVn1I,1635919,1643039,sort of surface looking things and  figure out what was really sort of  emotionally motivating about them
1u0KzfgVn1I,1643840,1649840,can you tell us about your involvement  with normcore  sure for us it didn't really have to do
1u0KzfgVn1I,1649840,1655360,with clothes but more had to do with  imagining a new form of coolness that  was about being as slippery and
1u0KzfgVn1I,1655360,1660880,adaptable as possible and allowing you  to get down with as many different  groups of people and types of people as
1u0KzfgVn1I,1660880,1665278,possible i love being as slippery as  possible
1u0KzfgVn1I,1666399,1672640,as literally as possible but you know we  were asked to create a report for the  occasion of
1u0KzfgVn1I,1672640,1677679,the  marathon at the serpentine in london  during freeze art fair in 2013. they
1u0KzfgVn1I,1677679,1684720,asked us to think about the question of  generation branding and if you could  create a new generation after
1u0KzfgVn1I,1684720,1691919,millennials generation x is it  generation z is it a me generation  whatever they're all there
1u0KzfgVn1I,1691919,1697679,oh people love having meetings about it  so we honed in on this cliche that  millennials all think they're so special
1u0KzfgVn1I,1697679,1703919,which you may have heard  and wait they know  and it occurred to us that maybe all of
1u0KzfgVn1I,1703919,1710480,society was worried about how special  they were so we started to reflect on  what  that actually meant and how you could
1u0KzfgVn1I,1710480,1716559,get out of this idea that you had to  enforce your coolness or specialness  against other people stealing it which
1u0KzfgVn1I,1716559,1724000,we looked at as a kind of alternative  perspective and we decided that we were  in this mass indie scenario where being
1u0KzfgVn1I,1724000,1729760,special and expressing your creativity  was the mainstream value so we kind of  came up with these two different routes
1u0KzfgVn1I,1729760,1736480,for how you might react to being in this  mass indie scenario the first one was  the idea that you just try to opt out of
1u0KzfgVn1I,1736480,1744000,it by  being as bland and basic as humanly  possible  which we in our report call acting basic
1u0KzfgVn1I,1744000,1749600,this idea that you can kind of be as  simple as possible and that'll somehow  get you out of the quandary just doesn't
1u0KzfgVn1I,1749600,1754880,seem to work at all  and so that's when we started to dream  of norm core we presented this report at
1u0KzfgVn1I,1754880,1760000,the serpentine and  it kind of bounced around on twitter and
1u0KzfgVn1I,1760000,1766320,in the art world we kind of didn't take  it very seriously we were sort of like  ah that's not really what we meant but
1u0KzfgVn1I,1766320,1772960,yeah who cares that's fine like the idea  with us coming up with new language is  for people to use it themselves so
1u0KzfgVn1I,1772960,1778159,our perspective wasn't that we should  police people's use of our language  and
1u0KzfgVn1I,1778159,1784480,it turned out being a mega meme  and it was really insane um  why do you think the fashion industry
1u0KzfgVn1I,1784480,1790399,was so quick to  drink in your pdfs and why were they so  attracted to you i think most of it has
1u0KzfgVn1I,1790399,1796960,to do with the fact that it was  sort of revolved around uh neologism  like just the fact that all of these i
1u0KzfgVn1I,1796960,1803600,don't know what that word means it means  no idea an invented word an inventive  something like normal and
1u0KzfgVn1I,1803600,1809520,i think the reach of that word again it  has a very sort of linguistic backing
1u0KzfgVn1I,1809520,1815279,you can it's a word that doesn't mean  anything like core from hardcore meaning  the sort of extreme behavior norm
1u0KzfgVn1I,1815279,1820559,meaning normal like it defeats itself in  its own sort of linguistic existence
1u0KzfgVn1I,1820559,1826000,people need more vocabulary for fashion  that's true there weren't that many new
1u0KzfgVn1I,1826000,1832399,words or ways to describe the way people  were dressing fabulous besides fabulous  darling
1u0KzfgVn1I,1832399,1838640,so i think that was part of it hipster  the idea of the hipster had been totally  exhausted
1u0KzfgVn1I,1838640,1844399,but in my opinion part of the reason  that went on so long this question of oh  hipsters think they're different but  they're actually the same it's because
1u0KzfgVn1I,1844399,1850720,there were no new words to yeah talk  about kind of  what it means to dress in a certain way
1u0KzfgVn1I,1850720,1856880,or have personal style or think of  yourself as cool so i think we came into  a vacuum in a certain way have you
1u0KzfgVn1I,1856880,1862240,invented any words that have reached the  dictionary  well normcore was the oxford english
1u0KzfgVn1I,1862240,1868240,dictionaries were runner-up  oh okay we lost to vape tied with bay
1u0KzfgVn1I,1868240,1874720,wow  it was a big it was a big boy
1u0KzfgVn1I,1875039,1881440,i'm asked about trends a lot and i don't  think they exist well i think that you  can connect certain dots and make a bet
1u0KzfgVn1I,1881440,1887120,on what you think is going to snowball  and become bigger and bigger okay so  what's the thing what's the next thing
1u0KzfgVn1I,1887120,1894000,i'm sure we can figure it out oh man  i think it's really big sleeves
1u0KzfgVn1I,1894000,1900240,really big really big sleeves really big  sleeves  i feel like really big sleeves is here
1u0KzfgVn1I,1900240,1905730,and they're really big  okay
1u0KzfgVn1I,1905730,1912799,[Music]  just two decades ago no one would have  prophesied that stylists makeup artists
1u0KzfgVn1I,1912799,1918640,and hairdressers toiling away behind the  scenes of fashion shows red carpets and  photo shoots would become celebrities in
1u0KzfgVn1I,1918640,1925120,their own right hello  apart from brooke  who spotted early on that the industry's  best stylists and technicians were
1u0KzfgVn1I,1925120,1930640,underrepresented despite their hugely  powerful role curating the looks of the  world's most revered celebrities and
1u0KzfgVn1I,1930640,1936640,models give me a tour please okay great  what are these these are that says  closers
1u0KzfgVn1I,1936640,1941919,because that's the deal makers closes  they're closing the deal getting it done
1u0KzfgVn1I,1941919,1948240,after a few years learning on the job  brooke set up her own agency the wall  group in 1999 which has since evolved in
1u0KzfgVn1I,1948240,1954399,perfect harmony with the ever-changing  landscapes of fashion and beauty  a fantastic role model for any aspiring
1u0KzfgVn1I,1954399,1959840,business woman and an oracle for anyone  wanting to pursue a career in the  styling or beauty industries is rather
1u0KzfgVn1I,1959840,1965840,amusing to learn that the whole thing  started because she had a serious crush  on a hairdresser i mean brooke i went to
1u0KzfgVn1I,1965840,1971679,london and i studied hair just as an  excuse to get to know him who is it i'm
1u0KzfgVn1I,1971679,1976120,not telling you oh come on
1u0KzfgVn1I,1978880,1985919,so can you explain to us what the wall  group is  the wall group is an agency that  represents talent within the
1u0KzfgVn1I,1985919,1993279,entertainment and  fashion industry such as hair stylists  makeup artists wardrobe stylists fashion
1u0KzfgVn1I,1993279,1998720,stylists set designers manicurists so  everyone who's sort of behind the scenes
1u0KzfgVn1I,1998720,2004480,magic elves that make something look  beautiful yeah the little sort of  fairies that run around behind the
1u0KzfgVn1I,2004480,2010320,scenes and sort of sprinkle stuff all  over people uh we represent those  individuals so before you set this up
1u0KzfgVn1I,2010320,2015600,what was your experience at the fashion  industry were you were you  hoping to be
1u0KzfgVn1I,2015600,2022080,a stylist yourself or a makeup artist i  was always attracted to fashion when i  was in my teens in canada they would ask
1u0KzfgVn1I,2022080,2027840,me if i would model  i did that once and i said this isn't  for me there are certain people that are
1u0KzfgVn1I,2027840,2033279,in front of the camera people and  there's certain people that are behind  the camera and i felt very comfortable
1u0KzfgVn1I,2033279,2039519,behind  kind of orchestrating and being the  puppeteer of making things happen so i i
1u0KzfgVn1I,2039519,2045760,recognized that very early and then when  i came to new york i thought well you  know what would be fun if i just went
1u0KzfgVn1I,2045760,2052320,and worked with  hey that guy orbe he has like a little  fun salon and he works with like christy
1u0KzfgVn1I,2052320,2058398,and naomi and linda and kate and all  those girls in the 90s and i'm just  gonna go and i'll work with him and help
1u0KzfgVn1I,2058398,2064878,him so i went in i had wet hair i wore  it under a hat and orvi looked at me and  said anyone has the balls to come and
1u0KzfgVn1I,2064878,2070960,for an interview with wet hair is hired  wow so he hired me on the spot and um
1u0KzfgVn1I,2070960,2077040,just got to know everyone and through  that katie ford approached me  she said just start an agency so i did
1u0KzfgVn1I,2077040,2084320,you were one of the first people to  realize the star power these talents  behind the scenes had in their own right
1u0KzfgVn1I,2084320,2089440,so how did you first spot maybe a  stylist or a makeup artist could become
1u0KzfgVn1I,2089440,2095839,their own brand almost i noticed that  celebrities were starting to become more  and more prolific on the cover of
1u0KzfgVn1I,2095839,2102160,magazines and  you know with a talent i kind of felt  like connecting them with that world
1u0KzfgVn1I,2102160,2108560,could elevate them equally  these people are celebrities within  themselves yeah equal to a lot of people
1u0KzfgVn1I,2108560,2115359,that are out there in their field like  as an expert in their field  can you talk to us about the ways in
1u0KzfgVn1I,2115359,2121440,which your business has evolved to  respond to the way that  the tech world has been incorporated
1u0KzfgVn1I,2121440,2128000,into the fashion industry yeah everybody  has always said i'm a little crazy full  stop
1u0KzfgVn1I,2128000,2135760,and when  twitter first launched i bought every  twitter book they had on social media
1u0KzfgVn1I,2135760,2142400,and i ran around the office and i put it  on all the agents desks and i said you  have to read this cover to cover you
1u0KzfgVn1I,2142400,2148800,have to understand this it is everything  it's the future of this industry you  have to and they were all like what is
1u0KzfgVn1I,2148800,2154720,she talking about how did you get that  idea though how did you know that that  was because because i started the
1u0KzfgVn1I,2154720,2161520,question on the phone about the artists  was how many fashion shows have they  done within probably
1u0KzfgVn1I,2161520,2166960,four years of opening the question  started what celebrities have they  worked with right
1u0KzfgVn1I,2166960,2173599,now it's how many followers do they have  wow  so i've kind of always been aware that
1u0KzfgVn1I,2173599,2179760,the business is going to  shift  clearly a natural-born innovator brooke
1u0KzfgVn1I,2179760,2185920,has never been one to settle for the  status quo  dissatisfied by the monotony of  promoting her talent's work on the news
1u0KzfgVn1I,2185920,2192480,pages of her website she ripped the blog  down and replaced it with the thick an  online magazine filled with juicy news
1u0KzfgVn1I,2192480,2197920,and views from industry insiders  can we talk about the thick and yeah
1u0KzfgVn1I,2197920,2203119,what that is and i can tell you exactly  what it is tell us what it is the thick
1u0KzfgVn1I,2203119,2208880,is very tongue-in-cheek  fun sort of insider in the thick of the
1u0KzfgVn1I,2208880,2214960,industry having all the information as  they say telefax telephone tell a  hairdresser that's how you get a message  around new york
1u0KzfgVn1I,2214960,2220800,and  and so it really there's a lot of  information but it's a celebration
1u0KzfgVn1I,2220800,2226079,platform of everybody who is not  celebrated in the industry and then some
1u0KzfgVn1I,2226079,2231680,who are it's for our talent to display  who they are to clients as well from a
1u0KzfgVn1I,2231680,2237599,personal perspective rather than just  looking through portfolios looking  through instagram looking through
1u0KzfgVn1I,2237599,2242720,traditional channels it's in place for  them to just tell a little story in two  three minutes for me at least when i'm
1u0KzfgVn1I,2242720,2249280,working with makeup artists or  hairstylists i'd say it's like 70  personality 30 talent totally is what
1u0KzfgVn1I,2249280,2255440,i'm looking for exactly i was like can i  stand with you  right for a week right in this industry
1u0KzfgVn1I,2255440,2262240,as an artist you are working with a  group of people to create something and  you have to be a person that people want
1u0KzfgVn1I,2262240,2270000,to hang out with all day and have fun  with  and i think personality is  so important so important i mean i love
1u0KzfgVn1I,2270000,2277200,a fanatical talent that can do something  perfectly but i also  am realistic in knowing that you have to
1u0KzfgVn1I,2277200,2282880,be human first yeah i think that's good  advice for people  what about um
1u0KzfgVn1I,2282880,2287920,someone that was a young entrepreneur  that was thinking of setting up their  own business whatever that may be are
1u0KzfgVn1I,2287920,2294000,there some kind of guidelines you could  give them or tip bits of advice you wish  you'd have known before starting your
1u0KzfgVn1I,2294000,2300800,own company maybe not do it um  you know for me i recognized
1u0KzfgVn1I,2300800,2306000,pretty young something there was a i had  an epiphany and i felt like by the time  i was 23 you know i think i'm going to
1u0KzfgVn1I,2306000,2311839,own my own business i'm going to employ  a lot of people and i'm going to make  all my own decisions by the time i'm 42.
1u0KzfgVn1I,2311839,2318160,that's what's going to happen for me  never thought about it again continued  struggling through my 20s wondering you
1u0KzfgVn1I,2318160,2325920,know what am i going to do what am i  going to you know 27 i woke up i said  you know it doesn't really matter if i'm  a janitor as long as i do a great job at
1u0KzfgVn1I,2325920,2331119,being a janitor  something will fall into place the right  thing is going to come to me
1u0KzfgVn1I,2331119,2338160,there i was mopping floors and there i  was going to trust me  it just works that way but you have to
1u0KzfgVn1I,2338160,2344240,have a gut feeling if you're an  entrepreneur  you have to know that you have that gene
1u0KzfgVn1I,2344240,2350960,and you have to be tough as nails  and be able to withstand a lot of hits
1u0KzfgVn1I,2350960,2357280,i feel like not everybody is meant for  that particular  job yeah you know or responsibility it's
1u0KzfgVn1I,2357280,2363200,a huge responsibility it's 24 7. it  never shuts off um and you are
1u0KzfgVn1I,2363200,2369040,you're you're responsible for people's  livelihoods it's not just an accessory  it's not a handbag to have your own a
1u0KzfgVn1I,2369040,2375040,business  it's a huge responsibility  if you feel you want a leadership role
1u0KzfgVn1I,2375040,2381040,then i think you have to be very very  diligent i think you have to be super  smart i think you have to study that
1u0KzfgVn1I,2381040,2386880,role inside and out  and understand  everything about it and
1u0KzfgVn1I,2386880,2392800,you will get that you will get that role  on we travel uptown and away from the
1u0KzfgVn1I,2392800,2397839,shop fronts and into a neighborhood  known for its higher education  institutions to meet another incredible
1u0KzfgVn1I,2397839,2404160,woman who spotted a gaping hole in the  ultra sheer denier of the fashion  industry stocking and admirably dove in
1u0KzfgVn1I,2404160,2409280,headfirst to darn it up do you watch  these things in the edit  like this for example will someone have
1u0KzfgVn1I,2409280,2416078,to watch watch that  this even me saying this they're having  to transcribe this as we speak
1u0KzfgVn1I,2419040,2425040,hello  oh welcome hi  lovely to meet you here susan scafidi
1u0KzfgVn1I,2425040,2430720,lover of frocks and professor of law  founded the fashion law institute at the  fordham law school in new york city
1u0KzfgVn1I,2430720,2436640,despite a distinctive lack of support  from her male colleagues since then she  has advocated tirelessly for recognition
1u0KzfgVn1I,2436640,2443119,of the need for a distinct fashion law  running the us's only and very  over-subscribed fashion law course and
1u0KzfgVn1I,2443119,2448400,generally kicking conceptual butt in the  murky field of copyright law
1u0KzfgVn1I,2448400,2454960,which is the original and which is the  alcohol  very good okay  i asked this question um over a period
1u0KzfgVn1I,2454960,2460640,of a year and a half to everyone who  wandered into my office completely  unscientific but it was this is the  original and this is the roof of course
1u0KzfgVn1I,2460640,2466319,it is  you would know that but only about 75  people got it right well it was the  finishing that really gave it away
1u0KzfgVn1I,2466319,2471599,they're finishing the quality of the  fabric is there not a rule where it's  like if seven things are different it's
1u0KzfgVn1I,2471599,2476640,okay that's the that's the biggest urban  legend okay so what is the law so in in
1u0KzfgVn1I,2476640,2482640,the us this is legal you don't have to  change a stitch  um a long time ago over 100 years ago
1u0KzfgVn1I,2482640,2489359,the us copyright office decided that  fashion even the most elaborate fanfall  fashion was merely functional and
1u0KzfgVn1I,2489359,2494400,therefore couldn't be protected but if  it's  if it's produced in the u.s under this
1u0KzfgVn1I,2494400,2500160,law but sold overseas where a different  law is in place do you then fall into
1u0KzfgVn1I,2500160,2505920,the problem it depends where it's first  created and produced so this because it  was first produced in europe is
1u0KzfgVn1I,2505920,2513839,protected in europe but if it had first  been produced in the u.s and then it was  copied in europe no such luck
1u0KzfgVn1I,2513839,2519280,10 years ago there was no such legal  field as fashion law and i'd tried for a
1u0KzfgVn1I,2519280,2525119,long time at different institutions to  to get permission to teach such a thing  and finally fordham decided to take a
1u0KzfgVn1I,2525119,2531359,chance on it and so we created a course  here as part of the affordable school  curriculum the idea was that it should
1u0KzfgVn1I,2531359,2537119,be a resource for the industry so five  years after that dion von furstenberg  and the council of fashion designers of
1u0KzfgVn1I,2537119,2543040,america helped us create an institute  which is a separate non-profit and we  have a number of courses that we run
1u0KzfgVn1I,2543040,2549119,inside of fordham inside of the  curriculum and we have a research  program and we have public events and we  have a clinic for designers who have no
1u0KzfgVn1I,2549119,2555680,money and no clue and nowhere to go how  was it that it didn't exist 10 years ago  was it not needed fashion houses
1u0KzfgVn1I,2555680,2561599,designers models etc have always  communicated with lawyers and consulted  lawyers but there was no formal training
1u0KzfgVn1I,2561599,2567760,for those lawyers and so they had to  sort of back into it and learn on their  own  and i think in part because this was the
1u0KzfgVn1I,2567760,2574400,neglected industry it is as it is in  britain the second largest industry in  new york city and yet there was no field
1u0KzfgVn1I,2574400,2580079,of law to support it and actually my  senior colleagues at another institution  refused to let me work on it they said
1u0KzfgVn1I,2580079,2587040,you can't write about fashion it's too  girly it's too frivolous no one will  take you seriously and i thought it's a  1.8 trillion dollar industry globally
1u0KzfgVn1I,2587040,2592160,approximately give or take a trillion  right they said  between friends precisely and so i
1u0KzfgVn1I,2592160,2598000,proposed fashion law and my poor  associate dean  had no idea what to say just silent one
1u0KzfgVn1I,2598000,2603359,wonderful colleague said we have sports  law we have two sections of sports law  isn't fashion law just sports law for
1u0KzfgVn1I,2603359,2609280,girls well it's the point i'll take it  where i can get it the associate dean  said to me you know if susan if we don't
1u0KzfgVn1I,2609280,2614480,get at least three students i have to  cancel the class i said okay  so seven o'clock in the morning
1u0KzfgVn1I,2614480,2619839,registration opened 703 the course is  full 705 i get the first email professor
1u0KzfgVn1I,2619839,2625440,is the is the registration link broken i  can't get into your class we had to  double the size of the class and that
1u0KzfgVn1I,2625440,2632000,was ten years ago and it went from there  amazing  so you trained to be a lawyer i did
1u0KzfgVn1I,2632000,2637359,did you always have in mind that you  would like to apply that  skill set to the fashion industry or did
1u0KzfgVn1I,2637359,2643280,it sort of unfold no it most definitely  unfolded you know my deep family roots  in fashion but never thought that
1u0KzfgVn1I,2643280,2649760,fashion was something i could do  professionally in fact i studied legal  history and was planning to be a legal  historian i studied medieval
1u0KzfgVn1I,2649760,2656960,ecclesiastical law of all things  i can't even say that  i'm not sure i can anymore either
1u0KzfgVn1I,2656960,2664480,but  what happened was i was teaching  intellectual property and things like  the video you're filming have extensive
1u0KzfgVn1I,2664480,2670400,intellectual property protection very  harmonized all over the world for your  life plus 70 years no one can copy this
1u0KzfgVn1I,2670400,2676319,without your permission really  there you go and unless the copyright  belongs to it to vogue which is a
1u0KzfgVn1I,2676319,2681920,slightly different thing that was in the  contract at some point i was fighting  for owning this concept well there you
1u0KzfgVn1I,2681920,2687359,go  and  as well you should  but the protection of fashion is
1u0KzfgVn1I,2687359,2693599,remarkably unharmonized so we can go to  country from country to country and film  and literature and works of quote
1u0KzfgVn1I,2693599,2701599,unquote fine art are protected but  fashion is is not or at least not in  many places and certainly not in the us
1u0KzfgVn1I,2703680,2710640,on the sitting on the desk is a law that  we helped pass actually a framed thing  with the blue ribbons oh yeah is uh
1u0KzfgVn1I,2710640,2716960,a law to protect child models uh in new  york oh really  all kinds of child performers had had
1u0KzfgVn1I,2716960,2723920,protections so child actors and dancers  and musicians had lots of protections  with regard to the hours they worked and
1u0KzfgVn1I,2723920,2729839,chaperones and percentage of what they  were paid until they were of age and  that sort of thing and models
1u0KzfgVn1I,2729839,2738480,specifically had no protection and so we  helped create an organization called the  model alliance to yes sir amazing i was
1u0KzfgVn1I,2738480,2744000,on my own and i didn't know how to stand  up for myself  unfortunately because even the youngest
1u0KzfgVn1I,2744000,2749440,models routinely work on chaperones  abuse of this kind is common that is one
1u0KzfgVn1I,2749440,2756960,of the jobs where you're rinsed the most  in terms of being like a child that's  working but also giving your agent 20
1u0KzfgVn1I,2756960,2762319,and and the client and the client you're  going gonna pay another twenty percent  on top of that so so they take forty  percent
1u0KzfgVn1I,2762319,2769839,exactly there's a lot well you know  better than anyone there's a lot of  exploitation in that industry  yeah it's amazing
1u0KzfgVn1I,2769839,2776560,do you have any helpful hints to say you  were a designer and you're setting up  your own label are there a few key
1u0KzfgVn1I,2776560,2782960,legal notes you could give someone that  would help them avoid a world of trouble  i'm so glad you asked
1u0KzfgVn1I,2782960,2788079,in speaking with young designers or  design students the first thing i say is  please don't put your name on the label
1u0KzfgVn1I,2788079,2794240,or at least think twice when you put  your name on the label and you trademark  that name it becomes a corporate asset
1u0KzfgVn1I,2794240,2800160,and so if at some point you take on an  investor and then somewhere down the  line part company with that investor
1u0KzfgVn1I,2800160,2806800,your name goes with your investor and  you have to walk nameless into the night  yeah and that's kind of that happens  alone it does happen a lot for for
1u0KzfgVn1I,2806800,2812400,people that are watching this um who are  like oh fashion law seems amazing i'd  love to get into that but don't
1u0KzfgVn1I,2812400,2818800,necessarily have the access to a local  uh degree in that area what else could
1u0KzfgVn1I,2818800,2825119,they do to potentially end up working in  this arena good so at this point we are  the only degree program in the world to
1u0KzfgVn1I,2825119,2831359,move to new york isn't that 715 new york  is one option but as a short as a short  version of that we run a two-week boot
1u0KzfgVn1I,2831359,2837920,camp and we do it every year and people  come from literally all over the world  and it's it's lawyers and law students
1u0KzfgVn1I,2837920,2846079,and fashion professionals which is  really cool but if you can't make it to  class you can always read and you should
1u0KzfgVn1I,2846079,2852720,and continue to educate yourself and if  you actually want to practice in the  area  then you need to to learn everything you
1u0KzfgVn1I,2852720,2858079,possibly can about the business of  fashion and then about the law and work  to put them together it seems wild that
1u0KzfgVn1I,2858079,2863119,as little as 10 years ago someone might  consider it girly and frivolous to like
1u0KzfgVn1I,2863119,2871280,take fashion law seriously i for a while  i thought it had a question mark at the  end of it because no one ever said  fashion law they said fashion law
1u0KzfgVn1I,2871280,2876449,it was always like that  [Music]
1u0KzfgVn1I,2876720,2883520,in the last series i saw a couple of  comments where they thought we were  being disparaging about bloggers  and i actually must admit that i felt
1u0KzfgVn1I,2883520,2890000,very threatened by the blogging  community when they first appeared on  the scene because suddenly they were  sitting in front of fashion week and as
1u0KzfgVn1I,2890000,2895680,a highbrow it girl  nobody everyone was like what  are they what are they doing and i think
1u0KzfgVn1I,2895680,2901599,people were really  scared of them because they had so much  power suddenly and so quickly
1u0KzfgVn1I,2901599,2907920,four years ago today exactly actually i  started a fashion blog called style  rookie the rise of the blogger is
1u0KzfgVn1I,2907920,2913839,arguably one of the most disruptive  fashion innovations of the past decade  in the early to mid 2000s driven by the

1u0KzfgVn1I,3074160,3079680,started a blog called man repeller which  is hugely popular there's millions of  followers on instagram
1u0KzfgVn1I,3079680,3084720,i don't know how you measure success in  blogs but imagine lots of sign ups  traffics
1u0KzfgVn1I,3084720,3092160,we'll ask her  have you heard of man repeller oh i have  no idea which one it's like this blog
1u0KzfgVn1I,3092160,3097599,do you go on blogs  do you know what a blog is blog
1u0KzfgVn1I,3097599,3104079,sorry it's like writing in a diary and  then giving it out to a million people  she's called leandra
1u0KzfgVn1I,3104079,3106800,have you heard of her
1u0KzfgVn1I,3110000,3117280,hello  hi sorry bit late how's it going you  look nice hi where's your skirt from top
1u0KzfgVn1I,3117280,3123839,shop  shop not prop  man repeller started as a college  project authored by journalist in
1u0KzfgVn1I,3123839,3129440,training leandra medin whose  self-deprecating comedic fashion-focused  commentary hit a real chord with women
1u0KzfgVn1I,3129440,3135280,all over the u.s and beyond so this is  typically what an editorial meeting  looks like alexa thanks
1u0KzfgVn1I,3135280,3140800,over a period of six years since the  blog was conceived she's won awards  topped a multitude of power lists
1u0KzfgVn1I,3140800,3147119,published a book and has developed man  repeller into one of the most respected  voices in the industry do you have no
1u0KzfgVn1I,3147119,3153119,ideas about idea policy  no idea is a bad idea no that we do not  have that policy what we have learned is
1u0KzfgVn1I,3153119,3159200,that many ideas are bad ideas  unsurprisingly she's got the cream of  the crop of young women queuing up for a
1u0KzfgVn1I,3159200,3166000,job in the noho office as she forges  crunchy colorful new paths in fashion  publishing so this is a resume that we
1u0KzfgVn1I,3166000,3171119,just received for  someone who'd like to intern at  mandapeller this summer oh my god how

1u0KzfgVn1I,3184400,3189680,literally teary-eyed  [Music]
1u0KzfgVn1I,3189680,3195760,what did you study at university i went  to school for journalism and i started  man repeller when i was a junior
1u0KzfgVn1I,3195760,3201359,um to hand in with my resume when i  applied for jobs at new york magazine  and the new yorker
1u0KzfgVn1I,3201359,3206720,because those were the two places i  wanted to work but what what came before  mamapillar were there any other blogs
1u0KzfgVn1I,3206720,3212319,out there  i had a blog before man repeller yeah  tell everyone what it was called burgers
1u0KzfgVn1I,3212319,3218960,and bagels real nice the byline was just  kidding this has nothing to do with  bagels  and how did you come up with the name
1u0KzfgVn1I,3218960,3224319,man repeller and how bored are you of  that question well no i'm actually not  bored of that question because every
1u0KzfgVn1I,3224319,3230880,time i every time i'm asked it i get to  answer it and every time i answer it it  gets a little bit spicier like i start
1u0KzfgVn1I,3230880,3236559,you know peppering nude lying basically  not lying i was broken up with my  husband at the time and he wasn't my
1u0KzfgVn1I,3236559,3243280,husband yet  he was just an ex-boyfriend right  and  i was also dating another guy and
1u0KzfgVn1I,3243280,3250240,another guy wait were you doing that new  yorker thing where you can date multiple  people without at one time well i  thought i was i felt so cool i was like
1u0KzfgVn1I,3250240,3256880,riding this high horse and i'm like look  at me i'm dating three guys at once each  and every one of them is obsessed with  me and then i had this realization that
1u0KzfgVn1I,3256880,3264400,none of them actually liked me because i  was still single it's saturday night and  i'm watching a movie with my mom
1u0KzfgVn1I,3264400,3270400,so that's how you came up with a memory  pedal so i was complaining to my friend  about this while we were at topshop and  she was like why are you so surprised
1u0KzfgVn1I,3270400,3276559,look at all the clothing you're about to  try on and i was like oh and then we  went into the dressing room and i took  off my pants and she's like when's the
1u0KzfgVn1I,3276559,3282400,last time you got a bikini wax  and i was like ah  and that's how man repeller was born so
1u0KzfgVn1I,3282400,3288319,do you think you have to have a bikini  work so get a boyfriend no but i don't  think it's unhelpful if you want to have
1u0KzfgVn1I,3288319,3293680,a boyfriend who's going to pleasure you  with his mouth right
1u0KzfgVn1I,3293680,3300079,i'm sorry i said that that's okay it's  probably not going to make the cut  it's hard for one to remember and cast
1u0KzfgVn1I,3300079,3305440,your mind back  to a moment before memorabilia existed  and that terminology was banded around
1u0KzfgVn1I,3305440,3312240,did that phrase exist before you made it  a thing no the phrase did not exist but  i think that man repelling which is
1u0KzfgVn1I,3312240,3317920,essentially dressing for yourself  regardless of what that means is a  social condition that has existed in
1u0KzfgVn1I,3317920,3324960,fashion since its establishment it  gained traction really really fast i  think partially because i was very
1u0KzfgVn1I,3324960,3332000,active on twitter and i think as a  result of that a couple of editors at  places like refinery29 and fashionista
1u0KzfgVn1I,3332000,3338000,and the new york daily news were  following me and so when i started  posting links to articles
1u0KzfgVn1I,3338000,3344559,they would see them and then write about  them on there so you were giving them  content for free basically
1u0KzfgVn1I,3344559,3350000,and they'd be like oh look at this funny  new website it's called man repeller and  then refinery picked it up and then the
1u0KzfgVn1I,3350000,3355839,new york daily news reached out and then  six months after i started the new york  times profiled me and i was like that's
1u0KzfgVn1I,3355839,3361119,it i'm done this is the end of it  finished see you later i can't wait to  tell my kids i was in the new york times
1u0KzfgVn1I,3361119,3367680,in 2012.  um  but then i was wrong it wasn't done  [Music]
1u0KzfgVn1I,3367680,3374799,the number one question people google a  lot is  how do blogs make
1u0KzfgVn1I,3375520,3381119,how money make money  i'm just kidding  when i started man repeller brands would
1u0KzfgVn1I,3381119,3386640,email me and say either  we'd love to collaborate with you or do  you sell advertising and i was managing
1u0KzfgVn1I,3386640,3392960,it on my own and just you know pulling  it out of my butt all right like  nastygal was our first advertiser and  they were like we'd love to run banner
1u0KzfgVn1I,3392960,3398720,ads and i was like that will be two  thousand dollars please  for example i don't know how much money
1u0KzfgVn1I,3398720,3405839,that is i was like no  okay i was much of the playing business  most people charge them based on a cost
1u0KzfgVn1I,3405839,3411040,per impression or a cost per click okay  they don't just charge flat fees i see
1u0KzfgVn1I,3411040,3416160,you know like when you're younger and  you play bank  no because i i was busy literally
1u0KzfgVn1I,3416160,3423359,sitting in a field drawing my horse  okay while you were playing bang  i was like i wish that pippi had pink
1u0KzfgVn1I,3423359,3429359,hair  so  we sold some banner ads or i sold some
1u0KzfgVn1I,3429359,3435119,banner ads but not really it was mostly  collaborations with other brands so i  did i made a trench coat with a brand
1u0KzfgVn1I,3435119,3440319,called griffin that's no longer in  existence but that was  because of your collaboration probably
1u0KzfgVn1I,3440319,3446400,not in the coffin so collaborations um  appearances okay ready guys
1u0KzfgVn1I,3446400,3451440,action hi guys it's me leandra and today  we're gonna paint some happy clouds on
1u0KzfgVn1I,3451440,3457440,my face  no we're not  and everything is so different now with  instagram so many of the blogs that were
1u0KzfgVn1I,3457440,3464079,around when i started are no longer they  no longer really have a presence on  desktop because they're just doing this
1u0KzfgVn1I,3464079,3470559,on instagram yeah how has that become a  important part of people's business well  because it's that's a lot of influence
1u0KzfgVn1I,3470559,3477119,right it's become a new form of media  instagram people charge as much as like  ten thousand dollars for a post
1u0KzfgVn1I,3477119,3482880,um  and they make that and then they  probably go to celine and buy necklaces  you don't do those though no we don't do
1u0KzfgVn1I,3482880,3488640,that because our head of monetization  really understood man repeller right off  the bat and that our
1u0KzfgVn1I,3488640,3494000,metric of success was going to be  measured in influence and quality versus
1u0KzfgVn1I,3494000,3500480,actual quantity and she has a very very  good sense of what works for us and what  doesn't so i've never actually had to
1u0KzfgVn1I,3500480,3506480,put in place a strategy for her because  her taste is just so on point
1u0KzfgVn1I,3507200,3512319,were you always this confident or did  you gain confidence through  your site doing really well do you think
1u0KzfgVn1I,3512319,3517760,i'm confident  you're taking a risk which i think some  people are kind of intimidated by the
1u0KzfgVn1I,3517760,3523280,idea of putting themselves out there  even right  well i definitely trust my instinct i
1u0KzfgVn1I,3523280,3529119,trust my gut and i think i have good  ideas yeah even though sometimes they're  not good ideas
1u0KzfgVn1I,3529119,3534960,there's a difference in my mind between  an entrepreneur and a smart business  person i think that i'm much more
1u0KzfgVn1I,3534960,3540079,entrepreneurial than i am actually  business savvy okay you know so i'm a  very innovative thinker and i'm
1u0KzfgVn1I,3540079,3545200,certainly ahead of what's going to  happen right in terms of media but i
1u0KzfgVn1I,3545200,3551200,freeze when the operational stuff comes  up when actually comes time to hire a  new developer
1u0KzfgVn1I,3551200,3556880,or look for  an operations person i'm just like i  can't do this when you're interviewing
1u0KzfgVn1I,3556880,3563440,for new people to join the team  what are you asking about and how  relevant is their degree or something
1u0KzfgVn1I,3563440,3570240,that they've had work experience at  uh in terms of what you're looking for  for the more operational and tedious
1u0KzfgVn1I,3570240,3576000,roles that work experience is obviously  really important but mostly i like to  get a sense of the people like what do
1u0KzfgVn1I,3576000,3581599,they do on weekends how do they respond  to situations like when we're at
1u0KzfgVn1I,3581599,3587680,restaurants are they saying thank you to  the waiter or waitress when they're  coming by that's always a pretty good  way to measure what kind of people they
1u0KzfgVn1I,3587680,3593280,are sometimes you just get a really good  feeling about someone when you sit down  with them can you break down
1u0KzfgVn1I,3593280,3600160,what some of the people in this office  for example are doing so we have a  deputy editor who's essentially my
1u0KzfgVn1I,3600160,3607359,creative right hand then we have a  photographer who shoots all of the  original content a managing editor who
1u0KzfgVn1I,3607359,3612559,manages making sure that all of our  contributors are hitting their deadlines  then we have a social media director and
1u0KzfgVn1I,3612559,3618640,a content strategist because  you know the home page on a website  isn't really a home page anymore only
1u0KzfgVn1I,3618640,3623680,like 15 of our traffic hits the home  page most people are coming in sideways
1u0KzfgVn1I,3623680,3629440,media twitter feed the facebook feed  right and then we have a sales team and  they just
1u0KzfgVn1I,3629440,3635760,work on bringing in the monies what  advice would you give anyone that's  trying to start their own media company
1u0KzfgVn1I,3635760,3640880,blog  hmm so the thing i say beyond
1u0KzfgVn1I,3640880,3647200,be really niche be streamlined don't try  to be  something for everyone just be
1u0KzfgVn1I,3647200,3653680,everything for someone  is that even beyond actually coming up  with your concept it's really important
1u0KzfgVn1I,3653680,3659040,to remain vulnerable because you're  you're very very honest with yourself  when you're feeling vulnerable and the
1u0KzfgVn1I,3659040,3665520,sort of like self-awareness that comes  out of that vulnerability is often very  very helpful
1u0KzfgVn1I,3665520,3671200,in your decision-making process  so  be vulnerable
1u0KzfgVn1I,3671200,3677200,remember where your priorities are  and keep that in mind  that's lovely
1u0KzfgVn1I,3677200,3680240,and open your legs
1u0KzfgVn1I,3684960,3692000,i really found it inspiring to talk to  leandra i immediately sort of took her  advice and started telling
1u0KzfgVn1I,3692000,3697839,my colleagues different ideas for how we  could run our business it's interesting  to see how fashion is evolving and i
1u0KzfgVn1I,3697839,3704720,think all these brands are turning into  media companies in their own right  because they have to  and the shopping experience is
1u0KzfgVn1I,3704720,3711040,far beyond brick and mortar at this  point it's like that might be the  flagship and there's justification for
1u0KzfgVn1I,3711040,3716880,having those shops like opening ceremony  which has turned into basically a  storytelling experience but that's not
1u0KzfgVn1I,3716880,3722960,the be all and end all of the customers  interaction with your brand  incorporating tech can actually provide
1u0KzfgVn1I,3722960,3728480,your business with even more of a  backbone i think the takeaway thing from  talking to all of those people has been
1u0KzfgVn1I,3728480,3733599,that they managed to find the right  partners in order to become successful
1u0KzfgVn1I,3733599,3739359,if you're not very good at the business  side or logistics then  you should admit that and find someone
1u0KzfgVn1I,3739359,3745110,that is and vice versa there's plenty of  jobs out there for you and you know  they're very much needed
1u0KzfgVn1I,3745110,3751599,[Music]  to people watching this i hope that they  are inspired to
1u0KzfgVn1I,3751599,3758640,just explore i think i think the thing  that we've learned from this series and  the last is that there's so many
1u0KzfgVn1I,3758640,3764240,benefits to doing internships in a  number of different career options
1u0KzfgVn1I,3764240,3770559,because all of that will feed in one day  to just knowing more about your craft  and you know take someone like brian
1u0KzfgVn1I,3770559,3775599,phillips who was working at a magazine  and doing editorial and had a huge  interest in art and then he's parlayed
1u0KzfgVn1I,3775599,3782880,that into a fantastic business model  with black frame who provide that  wonderful crossover
1u0KzfgVn1I,3782880,3788559,you know stop feeling like there's a  limited pool of things you can do  because if something's over saturated
1u0KzfgVn1I,3788559,3794559,then why not be entrepreneurial and make  up your own thing  you don't have to always follow the
1u0KzfgVn1I,3794559,3799680,crowd and actually the world would  benefit from more creative  exciting
1u0KzfgVn1I,3799680,3806720,things  well i ran out of steam i'm tired leave  me  we talked to so many people
1u0KzfgVn1I,3806720,3812880,so now i'm gonna nap  and dream of fashion as per usual
1u0KzfgVn1I,3813920,3819760,and that's it another series of the  future of fashion draws to an end i'm  off to continue my quest for world
1u0KzfgVn1I,3819760,3825599,domination and bigger sleeves thank you  so much for watching thank you so much  for recommending this to your friends
1u0KzfgVn1I,3825599,3832400,thank you and as ever subscribe to the  british vote youtube channel where i  will see you soon bye
1u0KzfgVn1I,3832400,3839160,put your comments in the box  i'm gonna go down the stairs now
