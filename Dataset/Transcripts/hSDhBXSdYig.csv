hSDhBXSdYig,2080,4560,welcome or welcome back to my channel
hSDhBXSdYig,4560,6799,today i thought it would be really fun
hSDhBXSdYig,6799,10240,to make a video talking about 2022
hSDhBXSdYig,10240,12799,fashion trends which ones am i loving
hSDhBXSdYig,12799,14880,and what do i not see myself
hSDhBXSdYig,14880,17600,participating in because one of my goals
hSDhBXSdYig,17600,19279,for the year was to figure out my
hSDhBXSdYig,19279,22080,personal fashion style a little bit more
hSDhBXSdYig,22080,24000,and it can be hard to do that when there
hSDhBXSdYig,24000,26160,are just new trends and micro trends
hSDhBXSdYig,26160,28000,popping up constantly you know
hSDhBXSdYig,28000,30240,sustainability wise it is not a good
hSDhBXSdYig,30240,33360,idea to invest in every single trend and
hSDhBXSdYig,33360,35360,also personal style wise you know it's
hSDhBXSdYig,35360,37280,good to pick and choose and i've been
hSDhBXSdYig,37280,40079,watching a lot of videos on 2022 trends

hSDhBXSdYig,117680,119280,the free chrome extension through the
hSDhBXSdYig,119280,121920,link in my description box now to get on
hSDhBXSdYig,121920,123600,to the trends that i've been liking
hSDhBXSdYig,123600,125759,first i picked out five for each that
hSDhBXSdYig,125759,127040,i've been liking and that i haven't been
hSDhBXSdYig,127040,129200,liking and we're just gonna go through
hSDhBXSdYig,129200,130560,them together
hSDhBXSdYig,130560,132800,clogs have been absolutely having their
hSDhBXSdYig,132800,136080,moment in 2022 and whether you like them
hSDhBXSdYig,136080,138879,or not it's hard to avoid them i feel
hSDhBXSdYig,138879,140720,like i see them everywhere
hSDhBXSdYig,140720,143120,and i personally really like them i
hSDhBXSdYig,143120,145920,think you can do a boston birkenstock
hSDhBXSdYig,145920,149360,clog and look very casual very farmers
hSDhBXSdYig,149360,152319,market art teacher chic or you can do a
hSDhBXSdYig,152319,155280,more studded and embellished clog and
hSDhBXSdYig,155280,157360,look a little bit more like you put
hSDhBXSdYig,157360,159360,effort in but still there's just
hSDhBXSdYig,159360,161599,something so casual about a shoe that
hSDhBXSdYig,161599,164080,you just slide on into you don't have to
hSDhBXSdYig,164080,165599,do any lacing up you don't have to do
hSDhBXSdYig,165599,167760,any buttoning any zippers it's just a
hSDhBXSdYig,167760,170959,slide it's essentially a slipper and i
hSDhBXSdYig,170959,173519,think after the years that we've had
hSDhBXSdYig,173519,176000,people want comfort and so i think that
hSDhBXSdYig,176000,178879,is why slides in birkenstocks are so
hSDhBXSdYig,178879,181200,popular right now but we've been getting
hSDhBXSdYig,181200,183280,some really cute variations on them you
hSDhBXSdYig,183280,185760,know whether it's a platform or
hSDhBXSdYig,185760,187840,again some embellishments
hSDhBXSdYig,187840,189680,they are something that i see myself
hSDhBXSdYig,189680,191840,investing in i just wanted to make sure
hSDhBXSdYig,191840,194239,that it was something that i would wear
hSDhBXSdYig,194239,196159,i'll link a couple that i think are cute
hSDhBXSdYig,196159,198080,in the description box i've been really
hSDhBXSdYig,198080,200480,leaning towards the charlotte stone pair
hSDhBXSdYig,200480,203280,as well as intentionally blank next up
hSDhBXSdYig,203280,205200,you might have seen this coming if you
hSDhBXSdYig,205200,207920,watched my recent favorites video i have
hSDhBXSdYig,207920,211360,been loving denim skirts specifically
hSDhBXSdYig,211360,215040,long midi to maxi length denim skirts i
hSDhBXSdYig,215040,217440,think these can be styled in a really
hSDhBXSdYig,217440,220720,effortless like model off-duty way i
hSDhBXSdYig,220720,223200,posted a tick tock wearing a denim skirt
hSDhBXSdYig,223200,225519,and someone told me that they never
hSDhBXSdYig,225519,228000,expected a denim skirt to look cool and
hSDhBXSdYig,228000,230959,not like one of the duggars so i do
hSDhBXSdYig,230959,232799,think it's very important to get the
hSDhBXSdYig,232799,236000,right cut of denim midi or maxi skirt as
hSDhBXSdYig,236000,237599,you can see with the ones i put on
hSDhBXSdYig,237599,240159,screen most of them are fitted some of
hSDhBXSdYig,240159,242400,them have like a cool slit up it just
hSDhBXSdYig,242400,244319,for like some more movement i would
hSDhBXSdYig,244319,246080,avoid the ones that are kind of more
hSDhBXSdYig,246080,248480,like a tent um because you do still want
hSDhBXSdYig,248480,251519,to show off your silhouette
hSDhBXSdYig,251519,254319,these are really easy to thrift when i
hSDhBXSdYig,254319,256880,went thrifting like last weekend i saw a
hSDhBXSdYig,256880,258880,ton of denim skirts they used to be
hSDhBXSdYig,258880,261199,really popular in the 90s
hSDhBXSdYig,261199,263520,so because of that i think it is smarter
hSDhBXSdYig,263520,265600,to just thrift one than buy one new
hSDhBXSdYig,265600,266560,because
hSDhBXSdYig,266560,269280,the best part of these is when they are
hSDhBXSdYig,269280,271440,old and unique i feel like i've been
hSDhBXSdYig,271440,274400,seeing brown leather everywhere i don't
hSDhBXSdYig,274400,275919,know if it's just me
hSDhBXSdYig,275919,278639,but i never used to pair brown and black
hSDhBXSdYig,278639,280800,together i didn't ever used to buy
hSDhBXSdYig,280800,283440,anything brown and with chocolate brown
hSDhBXSdYig,283440,285840,becoming really popular in the past year
hSDhBXSdYig,285840,287840,i've been seeing people wearing brown
hSDhBXSdYig,287840,290560,leather a lot especially with jackets
hSDhBXSdYig,290560,293280,bags shoes and like accessories brown
hSDhBXSdYig,293280,296160,leather to me feels just like the softer
hSDhBXSdYig,296160,298800,warmer version of black leather like
hSDhBXSdYig,298800,300639,black leather is a classic it's never
hSDhBXSdYig,300639,303039,going out of style but sometimes i can
hSDhBXSdYig,303039,305199,feel kind of like i'm in the matrix or
hSDhBXSdYig,305199,307520,just kind of bored of always wearing
hSDhBXSdYig,307520,309759,black leather accessories because if you
hSDhBXSdYig,309759,311680,know me i'm always wearing black
hSDhBXSdYig,311680,313600,everywhere so that is definitely
hSDhBXSdYig,313600,316560,something i have my eye on at the moment
hSDhBXSdYig,316560,319120,and i really prefer to get second hand
hSDhBXSdYig,319120,321280,leather so i will be thrifting this and
hSDhBXSdYig,321280,322880,looking on the reel reel i've been
hSDhBXSdYig,322880,326560,seeing a lot of these loose knits on
hSDhBXSdYig,326560,328880,tick tock and instagram lately i think
hSDhBXSdYig,328880,330639,it has to do with how many people are
hSDhBXSdYig,330639,332400,getting into crocheting and knitting
hSDhBXSdYig,332400,334240,that there's like a huge resurgence of
hSDhBXSdYig,334240,337120,that right now so if you have the skills
hSDhBXSdYig,337120,339360,you could make one of these at home but
hSDhBXSdYig,339360,341039,it is definitely something i don't have
hSDhBXSdYig,341039,344560,the talent to do so i have had my eye on
hSDhBXSdYig,344560,346479,searching for something like this that i
hSDhBXSdYig,346479,348560,can layer with because i just think it
hSDhBXSdYig,348560,350639,adds a really interesting texture i feel
hSDhBXSdYig,350639,352080,like i could see this being more of like
hSDhBXSdYig,352080,355039,a spring trend or even summer if you do
hSDhBXSdYig,355039,356880,like a loose crochet over a bathing suit
hSDhBXSdYig,356880,359280,that's always been in style um it looks
hSDhBXSdYig,359280,361520,like it's almost unraveling on your body
hSDhBXSdYig,361520,364080,which is cool for the last fashion trend
hSDhBXSdYig,364080,366400,that i love the look of this one i'm not
hSDhBXSdYig,366400,368800,too sure if i am capable of pulling it
hSDhBXSdYig,368800,370639,off you can let me know what you think
hSDhBXSdYig,370639,374080,um but that is cargo pants as well as
hSDhBXSdYig,374080,377280,cargo skirts basically just loose flowy
hSDhBXSdYig,377280,379440,pants maybe in like a thinner more
hSDhBXSdYig,379440,381520,workout material i don't think they
hSDhBXSdYig,381520,383919,necessarily have to have pockets on them
hSDhBXSdYig,383919,385759,or not i've been seeing a lot of these
hSDhBXSdYig,385759,388400,and again i really like the very
hSDhBXSdYig,388400,391120,effortless like i'm not trying very hard
hSDhBXSdYig,391120,393440,look and these definitely have that
hSDhBXSdYig,393440,395840,going for them i'm just not too sure a
hSDhBXSdYig,395840,398080,hundred percent if i can pull it off so
hSDhBXSdYig,398080,400080,i'll probably try and thrift a pair
hSDhBXSdYig,400080,402240,that's really cheap and see how i feel
hSDhBXSdYig,402240,404160,in them but i like the way that they
hSDhBXSdYig,404160,406720,look and part of fashion is exploring
hSDhBXSdYig,406720,408319,things that might feel out of your
hSDhBXSdYig,408319,410400,comfort zone maybe you'll look back and
hSDhBXSdYig,410400,412560,think it's cringy in a year from now or
hSDhBXSdYig,412560,414400,maybe it'll become a staple and you
hSDhBXSdYig,414400,416800,can't really know until you try it so i
hSDhBXSdYig,416800,418960,do tend to go the thrifted route for
hSDhBXSdYig,418960,421360,things like that just because um it's
hSDhBXSdYig,421360,423280,cheaper as a sidebar this isn't one of
hSDhBXSdYig,423280,426160,the trends that i noted but i've been
hSDhBXSdYig,426160,427840,seeing a lot of kilts as well like
hSDhBXSdYig,427840,430560,people wearing long plaid skirts so i
hSDhBXSdYig,430560,433280,thrifted one for again like ten dollars
hSDhBXSdYig,433280,434560,i think it might have even been cheaper
hSDhBXSdYig,434560,438160,than that and i've yet to style it but
hSDhBXSdYig,438160,440880,i'm trying i'll probably end up doing a
hSDhBXSdYig,440880,444319,2022 thrifting trends video maybe in
hSDhBXSdYig,444319,446319,like the next month or so
hSDhBXSdYig,446319,449280,just to go off of this video and now on
hSDhBXSdYig,449280,452240,to a couple trends that i feel don't
hSDhBXSdYig,452240,454720,personally align with my aesthetic and
hSDhBXSdYig,454720,457840,that i don't see myself investing in or
hSDhBXSdYig,457840,460000,wearing but it's totally fine if you
hSDhBXSdYig,460000,462240,like these things fashion is so
hSDhBXSdYig,462240,464479,individual and that's what makes it so
hSDhBXSdYig,464479,466960,cool um and i also think people can pull
hSDhBXSdYig,466960,469759,off all of these things i just don't
hSDhBXSdYig,469759,472720,think that i can or it's not for me and
hSDhBXSdYig,472720,475120,that's okay futuristic
hSDhBXSdYig,475120,477280,jelly sneakers
hSDhBXSdYig,477280,481520,i do not understand the appeal of i do
hSDhBXSdYig,481520,484800,love dad sneakers like new balances and
hSDhBXSdYig,484800,486879,like you know traditionally ugly
hSDhBXSdYig,486879,489599,sneakers with an outfit but for some
hSDhBXSdYig,489599,491919,reason these jelly sneakers with all of
hSDhBXSdYig,491919,495360,the like strings and metallics and
hSDhBXSdYig,495360,497680,colors just i just can't get behind it
hSDhBXSdYig,497680,499680,that's all i'm saying i feel like ties
hSDhBXSdYig,499680,502720,got really big this last year and
hSDhBXSdYig,502720,504800,they can be very hit or miss for me i
hSDhBXSdYig,504800,506560,think sometimes with like the right
hSDhBXSdYig,506560,508319,going out outfit they can look really
hSDhBXSdYig,508319,510800,cool especially if it's paired with like
hSDhBXSdYig,510800,513599,a shorter skirt and like i think this
hSDhBXSdYig,513599,515440,photo specifically
hSDhBXSdYig,515440,518240,she's pulling it off very very well both
hSDhBXSdYig,518240,521360,of these girls then a photo like this
hSDhBXSdYig,521360,523680,and this is bella hadid she looks like a
hSDhBXSdYig,523680,526080,waitress and her style is one of my
hSDhBXSdYig,526080,527920,absolute favorites it just doesn't
hSDhBXSdYig,527920,531040,always work for me and i love men's wear
hSDhBXSdYig,531040,533279,on women i feel like that is like one of
hSDhBXSdYig,533279,536560,my all-time favorite things in fashion
hSDhBXSdYig,536560,539120,but ties can be very
hSDhBXSdYig,539120,541200,give or take they have to be thin
hSDhBXSdYig,541200,543760,and i prefer them not super bold
hSDhBXSdYig,543760,546560,personally speaking of bold patterns i
hSDhBXSdYig,546560,549519,feel like bold pattern mixing is
hSDhBXSdYig,549519,552160,something that i just don't see lasting
hSDhBXSdYig,552160,554000,very long i think it's already kind of
hSDhBXSdYig,554000,557040,dying out just because there was such a
hSDhBXSdYig,557040,560000,huge craze for the past few years i just
hSDhBXSdYig,560000,562160,i get really tired of seeing the same
hSDhBXSdYig,562160,564399,prince and i think that does have to do
hSDhBXSdYig,564399,567040,so much with fast fashion just running
hSDhBXSdYig,567040,568959,this trend to the ground i think the
hSDhBXSdYig,568959,571120,best example i can think of is this
hSDhBXSdYig,571120,573839,pattern from lisa s gaw i think the
hSDhBXSdYig,573839,575519,first time i saw it i thought it was
hSDhBXSdYig,575519,578959,cute but now it is everywhere everyone's
hSDhBXSdYig,578959,581760,ripping it off and when i see it i get a
hSDhBXSdYig,581760,583839,headache and it sucks for the people
hSDhBXSdYig,583839,586480,that invested in it you know a 200 pair
hSDhBXSdYig,586480,588240,of pants in the beginning i would be
hSDhBXSdYig,588240,590240,careful what you do invest in when it
hSDhBXSdYig,590240,593440,comes to bolds just because bolds don't
hSDhBXSdYig,593440,596320,always hold up but again that is just my
hSDhBXSdYig,596320,599440,opinion i tend to invest in like quality
hSDhBXSdYig,599440,602640,basics and then get my more funky pieces
hSDhBXSdYig,602640,604880,from the thrift store where they are
hSDhBXSdYig,604880,606959,less expensive and a little bit more
hSDhBXSdYig,606959,609920,unique someone is very over me talking
hSDhBXSdYig,609920,613440,but the last trend or aesthetic that
hSDhBXSdYig,613440,616880,just does not personally work on me is
hSDhBXSdYig,616880,620720,y2k fashion rhinestones and heavy
hSDhBXSdYig,620720,623600,graphic embellishments with brand names
hSDhBXSdYig,623600,627680,i just don't see that really outlasting
hSDhBXSdYig,627680,630079,and every time i've kind of like dabbled
hSDhBXSdYig,630079,632640,in it i haven't really liked the outfits
hSDhBXSdYig,632640,634560,after like six months let me see if i
hSDhBXSdYig,634560,636399,can find an example of me wearing like a
hSDhBXSdYig,636399,639200,somewhat y2k outfit it just isn't for me
hSDhBXSdYig,639200,642240,i've tried it i think it's cute but i
hSDhBXSdYig,642240,644480,just don't feel confident when i'm
hSDhBXSdYig,644480,646320,wearing stuff like that but i totally
