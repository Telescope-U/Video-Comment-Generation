V3MBpPgvGFE,80,1599,and now to the latest on that new
V3MBpPgvGFE,1599,3600,testimony from the january 6 committee
V3MBpPgvGFE,3600,5520,hearings cassidy hutchinson a former
V3MBpPgvGFE,5520,7680,aide to donald trump's chief of staff
V3MBpPgvGFE,7680,9760,testified that mark meadows said days
V3MBpPgvGFE,9760,12480,ahead of time that january 6 could get
V3MBpPgvGFE,12480,15280,quote real real bad she said trump knew
V3MBpPgvGFE,15280,16960,his supporters were armed he tried to
V3MBpPgvGFE,16960,19119,get metal detectors turned off so they
V3MBpPgvGFE,19119,20800,could join the rally
V3MBpPgvGFE,20800,23119,and wanted to go to the capitol himself
V3MBpPgvGFE,23119,24640,for more on the january 6th hearing i
V3MBpPgvGFE,24640,27920,want to bring in abc's alex prashay
V3MBpPgvGFE,27920,30000,alex a lot of attention is being called
V3MBpPgvGFE,30000,32078,to the conversation about what
V3MBpPgvGFE,32078,33600,did or didn't happen inside the
V3MBpPgvGFE,33600,35200,president's vehicle but there's sort of
V3MBpPgvGFE,35200,37440,more to this testimony do you think
V3MBpPgvGFE,37440,40239,hutchinson did enough here to show that
V3MBpPgvGFE,40239,42879,white house officials knew
V3MBpPgvGFE,42879,45280,what was going to happen on january 6 or
V3MBpPgvGFE,45280,46960,at least that there was a potential for
V3MBpPgvGFE,46960,48800,violence and that they purposely did
V3MBpPgvGFE,48800,51199,nothing to stop it well diane i think
V3MBpPgvGFE,51199,55199,her testimony points out a number of of
V3MBpPgvGFE,55199,56640,points where
V3MBpPgvGFE,56640,58640,violence or the possibility of violence
V3MBpPgvGFE,58640,60320,was discussed within the former
V3MBpPgvGFE,60320,62399,administration and nothing was done
V3MBpPgvGFE,62399,64239,about it right they talked about uh the
V3MBpPgvGFE,64239,66400,the intelligent intelligence coming in
V3MBpPgvGFE,66400,69439,prior to january 6 uh about some of the
V3MBpPgvGFE,69439,72479,weapons that uh that that police
V3MBpPgvGFE,72479,74320,officers and law enforcement had seen
V3MBpPgvGFE,74320,76400,around the capitol
V3MBpPgvGFE,76400,78880,some of the chatter online and how that
V3MBpPgvGFE,78880,80720,could be potentially violent she
V3MBpPgvGFE,80720,82560,testified about how the president wanted
V3MBpPgvGFE,82560,84320,to get rid of the mags
V3MBpPgvGFE,84320,87040,during his speech to fill in his crowd
V3MBpPgvGFE,87040,89119,so that it presented well and how he
V3MBpPgvGFE,89119,91119,even allegedly said that well they're
V3MBpPgvGFE,91119,94560,not here to hurt me uh and then also uh
V3MBpPgvGFE,94560,96560,she talked about testified about the
V3MBpPgvGFE,96560,99280,conversation that pat sipoloni had with
V3MBpPgvGFE,99280,101840,mark meadows basically saying that he
V3MBpPgvGFE,101840,103520,would have blood on his hands and that
V3MBpPgvGFE,103520,105439,people would die if this administration
V3MBpPgvGFE,105439,106880,didn't do anything
V3MBpPgvGFE,106880,109680,now hutchinson's testimony came after
V3MBpPgvGFE,109680,111119,the committee originally said they were
V3MBpPgvGFE,111119,112880,going to postpone the hearings for a few
V3MBpPgvGFE,112880,115040,weeks then they announced the surprise
V3MBpPgvGFE,115040,116079,hearing
V3MBpPgvGFE,116079,119119,and here comes this testimony
V3MBpPgvGFE,119119,120399,what happened there what went into the
V3MBpPgvGFE,120399,122479,committee's decision to do it this way
V3MBpPgvGFE,122479,124479,was this for theatrics or was there
V3MBpPgvGFE,124479,126719,something logistical there well i mean i
V3MBpPgvGFE,126719,129599,i think i think part of this is is is
V3MBpPgvGFE,129599,131039,certainly impact but but a lot of this
V3MBpPgvGFE,131039,132959,has been fluid right and we knew that
V3MBpPgvGFE,132959,134640,cassidy hutchinson had been in
V3MBpPgvGFE,134640,137040,negotiations for months
V3MBpPgvGFE,137040,139760,about about testimony she had a change
V3MBpPgvGFE,139760,142400,of counsel at the start of this month
V3MBpPgvGFE,142400,145360,so so that could have uh played with the
V3MBpPgvGFE,145360,147040,timing here but i also think it was
V3MBpPgvGFE,147040,149280,probably critical for this committee to
V3MBpPgvGFE,149280,152400,have her testify before these
V3MBpPgvGFE,152400,154160,these hearings later on in july after
V3MBpPgvGFE,154160,156400,the july 4th break and that's because we
V3MBpPgvGFE,156400,159040,know that we're expecting to see
V3MBpPgvGFE,159040,160879,footage from that british documentary
V3MBpPgvGFE,160879,163440,that british filmmaker alex holder which
V3MBpPgvGFE,163440,165920,could further connect some of these dots
V3MBpPgvGFE,165920,166879,now
V3MBpPgvGFE,166879,169040,the trump administration or president
V3MBpPgvGFE,169040,170560,trump himself and a few of his inner
V3MBpPgvGFE,170560,172239,circle are pushing back against some of
V3MBpPgvGFE,172239,174239,this testimony and there's one moment
V3MBpPgvGFE,174239,176000,where representative liz cheney asked
V3MBpPgvGFE,176000,178000,hutchinson about a handwritten note that
V3MBpPgvGFE,178000,180239,she says was dictated by mark meadows
V3MBpPgvGFE,180239,181920,and written by her
V3MBpPgvGFE,181920,183599,about a potential statement for
V3MBpPgvGFE,183599,185200,president trump to release during the
V3MBpPgvGFE,185200,187680,attack on the capital she says she wrote
V3MBpPgvGFE,187680,189360,that that was her handwriting now former
V3MBpPgvGFE,189360,190959,trump white house lawyer eric hershman
V3MBpPgvGFE,190959,193680,says he was the one who wrote that note
V3MBpPgvGFE,193680,196159,so what's the reaction in washington
V3MBpPgvGFE,196159,197760,i mean to this back and forth but more
V3MBpPgvGFE,197760,199680,overall about hutchinson's credibility
V3MBpPgvGFE,199680,200879,in general
V3MBpPgvGFE,200879,203519,well so diane certainly those in trump's
V3MBpPgvGFE,203519,206799,inner circle have done their best to
V3MBpPgvGFE,206799,209599,throw cold water on cassidy hutchinson's
V3MBpPgvGFE,209599,212640,testimony to question her credibility
V3MBpPgvGFE,212640,214720,and and you saw that a little bit uh
V3MBpPgvGFE,214720,216319,with with this handwritten note but i
V3MBpPgvGFE,216319,219120,can tell you that uh the the the
V3MBpPgvGFE,219120,221599,committee has said it has done its due
V3MBpPgvGFE,221599,224400,diligence and in this and has found that
V3MBpPgvGFE,224400,226400,miss hutchinson's account of the matter
V3MBpPgvGFE,226400,229120,is credible while we understand that she
V3MBpPgvGFE,229120,231120,and mr hershman may have have different
V3MBpPgvGFE,231120,232879,differing recollections of who wrote
V3MBpPgvGFE,232879,235599,that note what's ultimately important is
V3MBpPgvGFE,235599,238959,that the immediate unstructured uh uh
V3MBpPgvGFE,238959,240799,what should be is that the president had
V3MBpPgvGFE,240799,243200,uh immediate and unstructured support to
V3MBpPgvGFE,243200,245360,leave the capitol building
V3MBpPgvGFE,245360,248560,all right alex preshay thank you
