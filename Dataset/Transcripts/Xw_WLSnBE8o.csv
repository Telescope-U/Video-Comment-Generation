Xw_WLSnBE8o,164160,170080,And i'll admit hearing this gagged me for sure  because Violet sort of has made a brand on being  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,170080,175680,unbothered and i thought the whole thing initially  was a great PR play by Violet to get the show in  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,175680,180239,herself some attention and views etc; because  as a reminder the only thing we actually heard  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,180240,185920,"from Violet about the whole situation was she  ""booted your faves and will be doing it again"".  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,185920,190000,I guess it's just a shame no one will ever see  her do it because it's locked behind a paywall.
Xw_WLSnBE8o,190000,193680,"Now let's move on to India versus  the world... India Ferrah, that is.  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,193680,199439,Our feud here begins on June 18th when the latest  pit stop episode for All Stars 7 episode 6 dropped  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,199440,203760,featuring Derrick Barry as the co-host.  Bob started them off with a bit of banter:
Xw_WLSnBE8o,203760,206080,You are a liar and that's  why Derrick don't like you. 
Xw_WLSnBE8o,206080,212000,Yeah true that's so good. Still true. And Derrick  also seems to confirm here her relationship  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,212000,217040,with miss India Ferrah is still not great. I love working with her; she's uh in  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,217040,223920,"the Vegas show. India? No. Alexis! No. And as a quick refresher, the Alexis Mateo  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,223920,229599,quote comes from the lipstick elimination voting  when she was mad at India Ferrah for telling Shea  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,229600,234560,and the rest of the group that there had been a  campaign to get Shea eliminated several episodes  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,234560,239280,prior Alexis vehemently denied it this episode we  finally heard more about it in the semi-reunion  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,239280,244080,they did at the end of this season and Mayhem  Miller explains i voted for Shea but Alexis didn't  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,244080,249040,ask me to do that and alexa says there you have  it and india finally says well it's just what i  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,249040,255040,heard on the side of the stage mayhem and Alexis  both asked if i voted shae off so like cut and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,255040,260639,dry from every person in the story there was no  campaign but enough brushing up on backstory our  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,260640,266560,story continues with a tweet from India Ferrah in  the wee hours of the morning on June 19th writing  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,266560,272400,guess that drag race live gig ain't keeping you  that busy since my name is still in that crusty  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,272400,278320,mouth. I think she's my number one fan tbh minding  my own damn business the next morning that same  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,278320,282400,day she wrote it's the hashtag twitter trolls  acting like they still know everything about  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,282400,288160,me and my life sweeties i own and run a full-time  business making my own money. *clappy emoji* And  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,288160,294640,i get to travel to do shows on my own terms when  i want to clueless and ignorance doesn't mix well  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,294640,300560,"bless them so very thankful i work for myself and  that i'm not a ""slave"" for someone paying pennies  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,300560,305040,while other cast members make 10 times the amount  of pay you are go enjoy the rest of shows you got  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,305040,309760,this year you're gonna need each and every one of  them #bestdecisionimade - And by the way i want to  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,309760,314160,say thanks to my patrons who helped me find some  of these deleted tweets. Andrew actually pointed  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,314160,320160,out to me that they were available on the Way Back  Machine in my Discord! Which by the way is a Bussy  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,320160,325040,queen patreon member exclusive and you can join  my patreon by clicking the link in the description  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,325040,329200,of this video - see you there! But back to the  drama; And Shea replied to that second tweet in  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,329200,333600,that thread writing the choice to say you're not  a quote slave on juneteenth is truly camp you've  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,333600,338000,outdone yourself sis India Ferrah then tweeted  oh here we go i forgot i can't tweet anything  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,338000,341760,without it being racist or taken offensively  thank you for reminding me why i don't play the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,341760,346240,games y'all choose to play not all of us are quote  perfect she also addressed the twitter user that  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,346240,351680,wrote her weird how you can't just say my bad it  sounds a little up to say i'm not a slave on the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,351680,356080,day slavery was abolished in the south writing  yes weird because it was a britney reference how  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,356080,360639,weird right? Then Shea quote tweeted india's next  tweet writing you want to talk the talk but you  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,360640,366240,deleted it very quickly didn't you to which india  replied yes because just like on as5 you turned  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,366240,372000,"something into something it was not very useless  hashtag i never said alliance. And Shea responded,  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,372000,376560,you literally lied and got caught up in your  shenanigans so blame me for your downfall good  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,376560,382320,luck with all your bookings i hear shark week  is gonna be really amazing this year that'll  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,382320,386960,make more sense shortly we also see Alexis jump  in here with an interaction of her and Shea in the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,386960,392240,work room back on All Stars 5. And she replied to  Shea here writing yes tune in you're going to love  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,392240,397120,it y'all heart me. Let's see how many blocks i can  make happen today i'm up to 25 already y'all take  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,397120,401040,"twitter to a whole new level. She then seemingly  changed her tune about 30 minutes later writing,  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,401040,405600,dear twitter and twitter trolls please accept my  sincerest apologies for tweeting a britney spears  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,405600,409840,song reference on juneteenth i truly did not mean  any harm or negativity by it sending love and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,409840,414240,peace to you all and about an hour later Alexis  Mateo tweeted out is she looking for attention and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,414240,421840,finally we see Derrick Barry jump again all this  because i said the word no mega show no Alexis  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,422400,429919,no drag race live drag brunch Vegas hashtag fully  booked world traveler hashtag them shoulders  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,429920,435280,don't match them hips and then we get one of  the most savage reads from Derrick Barry to  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,435280,439680,"ever grace the twitter-sphere, she wrote She  thinks I can't keep her name out of my mouth  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,439680,449840,"yet she can't keep the plaque out of hers tooth  emoji... Meatball responded with this photo,"
Xw_WLSnBE8o,455520,457680,no words i just i can't  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,461680,467199,and that is where we see miss India Ferrah depart  from the feud she tweeted out this note i've been  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,467200,471040,extremely blessed with this new life i built on  my own i ask no one for anything other than to  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,471040,475680,let me live my life being in the spotlight as  a tv character has had its ups and downs i've  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,475680,479520,made mistakes like every human being and i've  made choices to speak up for myself when i felt  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,479520,484080,i was wrong every time i do though my narrative  gets twisted to fit someone else's story better  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,484080,488639,i'm tired of defending myself i'm tired of the  internet trolls i'm tired of people not knowing  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,488640,493040,who i really am because of what others have to  say about me when they are not even happy with  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,493040,497440,themselves i don't need the internet to live a  good life i made a mistake of responding to yet  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,497440,501600,again another post caused by the same person  trying to harm me over things that occurred  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,501600,506240,years ago if they are so happy with their lives  why bring me up again therefore since i can never  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,506240,510720,get my point across without being put in a corner  i will remove myself i will be deleting my twitter  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,510720,515039,as nothing good or positive has ever came from it  i wish everyone the best and then the next day we  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,515039,520159,"see a message from India Farrah's husband who on  an instagram story wrote, Derrick Barry Alexis  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,520159,524800,"Mateo, Shea you all have some really sad lives  you say you are against people who bully and  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,524800,529120,y'all are setting the perfect example of being  one y'all don't stand for anything but hate db  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,529120,534320,can't stand being a one-trick pony and is a  huge fan and clearly can't take a bite back...  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,535760,542400,Not a bite back sorry... I haven't read this  yet. AM still thinks she should have won and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,542400,548160,that she's slaying so she has to have groupies  with her because her career like DB relies on  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,548160,553199,India and Shea just can never win so she needs  to play the race card to distract them from the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,553200,559520,truth which they are all still holding on to good  for you girls girl show this new generation how  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,559520,564960,you shall bully someone very well done #RPDR  i hope you are very proud of your girls during  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,564960,570160,this pride month your cast couldn't wait for this  moment and it's clear as daylight best part is no  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,570160,574079,[ __ ] can read her for her talent exactly what  y'all are missing if they say these things about  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,574080,578800,her imagine what they say about you when they turn  their heads i rest my case switch the narrative on  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,578800,584800,"her so y'all look like the queens you always  wanted to be ""Envidiosas"" #TalentlessMonsters  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,585440,589040,and it may also be worth noting some  other queens jumped in on the drama;  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,589040,593440,Roxxy tweeted what is this India everyone's  talking about is it a dentist? And Jiggly  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,593440,598960,replied nope apparently it sells popcorn at music  festivals and calls it her booked and busy gigs  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,600080,605120,and that is everything that happened with the feud  objectively speaking it was pretty clear that on  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,605120,611440,the pit stop Derrick and bob were sharing a joke  about an iconic drag race moment and Derrick was  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,611440,616240,polite she didnt really say anything. India was  the one who jumped on twitter with the insults  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,616240,621680,sometimes like india said removing yourself is  the best and only option wow wait imagine the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,621680,626480,conspiracy theory behind this though that this is  actually just another ruse by world of wonder and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,626480,634320,drag race to promote the drag race live in vegas  show oh we're all being tricked life is a lie

Xw_WLSnBE8o,164160,170080,And i'll admit hearing this gagged me for sure  because Violet sort of has made a brand on being  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,170080,175680,unbothered and i thought the whole thing initially  was a great PR play by Violet to get the show in  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,175680,180239,herself some attention and views etc; because  as a reminder the only thing we actually heard  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,180240,185920,"from Violet about the whole situation was she  ""booted your faves and will be doing it again"".  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,185920,190000,I guess it's just a shame no one will ever see  her do it because it's locked behind a paywall.
Xw_WLSnBE8o,190000,193680,"Now let's move on to India versus  the world... India Ferrah, that is.  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,193680,199439,Our feud here begins on June 18th when the latest  pit stop episode for All Stars 7 episode 6 dropped  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,199440,203760,featuring Derrick Barry as the co-host.  Bob started them off with a bit of banter:
Xw_WLSnBE8o,203760,206080,You are a liar and that's  why Derrick don't like you. 
Xw_WLSnBE8o,206080,212000,Yeah true that's so good. Still true. And Derrick  also seems to confirm here her relationship  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,212000,217040,with miss India Ferrah is still not great. I love working with her; she's uh in  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,217040,223920,"the Vegas show. India? No. Alexis! No. And as a quick refresher, the Alexis Mateo  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,223920,229599,quote comes from the lipstick elimination voting  when she was mad at India Ferrah for telling Shea  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,229600,234560,and the rest of the group that there had been a  campaign to get Shea eliminated several episodes  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,234560,239280,prior Alexis vehemently denied it this episode we  finally heard more about it in the semi-reunion  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,239280,244080,they did at the end of this season and Mayhem  Miller explains i voted for Shea but Alexis didn't  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,244080,249040,ask me to do that and alexa says there you have  it and india finally says well it's just what i  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,249040,255040,heard on the side of the stage mayhem and Alexis  both asked if i voted shae off so like cut and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,255040,260639,dry from every person in the story there was no  campaign but enough brushing up on backstory our  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,260640,266560,story continues with a tweet from India Ferrah in  the wee hours of the morning on June 19th writing  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,266560,272400,guess that drag race live gig ain't keeping you  that busy since my name is still in that crusty  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,272400,278320,mouth. I think she's my number one fan tbh minding  my own damn business the next morning that same  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,278320,282400,day she wrote it's the hashtag twitter trolls  acting like they still know everything about  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,282400,288160,me and my life sweeties i own and run a full-time  business making my own money. *clappy emoji* And  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,288160,294640,i get to travel to do shows on my own terms when  i want to clueless and ignorance doesn't mix well  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,294640,300560,"bless them so very thankful i work for myself and  that i'm not a ""slave"" for someone paying pennies  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,300560,305040,while other cast members make 10 times the amount  of pay you are go enjoy the rest of shows you got  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,305040,309760,this year you're gonna need each and every one of  them #bestdecisionimade - And by the way i want to  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,309760,314160,say thanks to my patrons who helped me find some  of these deleted tweets. Andrew actually pointed  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,314160,320160,out to me that they were available on the Way Back  Machine in my Discord! Which by the way is a Bussy  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,320160,325040,queen patreon member exclusive and you can join  my patreon by clicking the link in the description  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,325040,329200,of this video - see you there! But back to the  drama; And Shea replied to that second tweet in  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,329200,333600,that thread writing the choice to say you're not  a quote slave on juneteenth is truly camp you've  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,333600,338000,outdone yourself sis India Ferrah then tweeted  oh here we go i forgot i can't tweet anything  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,338000,341760,without it being racist or taken offensively  thank you for reminding me why i don't play the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,341760,346240,games y'all choose to play not all of us are quote  perfect she also addressed the twitter user that  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,346240,351680,wrote her weird how you can't just say my bad it  sounds a little up to say i'm not a slave on the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,351680,356080,day slavery was abolished in the south writing  yes weird because it was a britney reference how  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,356080,360639,weird right? Then Shea quote tweeted india's next  tweet writing you want to talk the talk but you  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,360640,366240,deleted it very quickly didn't you to which india  replied yes because just like on as5 you turned  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,366240,372000,"something into something it was not very useless  hashtag i never said alliance. And Shea responded,  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,372000,376560,you literally lied and got caught up in your  shenanigans so blame me for your downfall good  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,376560,382320,luck with all your bookings i hear shark week  is gonna be really amazing this year that'll  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,382320,386960,make more sense shortly we also see Alexis jump  in here with an interaction of her and Shea in the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,386960,392240,work room back on All Stars 5. And she replied to  Shea here writing yes tune in you're going to love  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,392240,397120,it y'all heart me. Let's see how many blocks i can  make happen today i'm up to 25 already y'all take  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,397120,401040,"twitter to a whole new level. She then seemingly  changed her tune about 30 minutes later writing,  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,401040,405600,dear twitter and twitter trolls please accept my  sincerest apologies for tweeting a britney spears  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,405600,409840,song reference on juneteenth i truly did not mean  any harm or negativity by it sending love and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,409840,414240,peace to you all and about an hour later Alexis  Mateo tweeted out is she looking for attention and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,414240,421840,finally we see Derrick Barry jump again all this  because i said the word no mega show no Alexis  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,422400,429919,no drag race live drag brunch Vegas hashtag fully  booked world traveler hashtag them shoulders  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,429920,435280,don't match them hips and then we get one of  the most savage reads from Derrick Barry to  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,435280,439680,"ever grace the twitter-sphere, she wrote She  thinks I can't keep her name out of my mouth  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,439680,449840,"yet she can't keep the plaque out of hers tooth  emoji... Meatball responded with this photo,"
Xw_WLSnBE8o,455520,457680,no words i just i can't  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,461680,467199,and that is where we see miss India Ferrah depart  from the feud she tweeted out this note i've been  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,467200,471040,extremely blessed with this new life i built on  my own i ask no one for anything other than to  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,471040,475680,let me live my life being in the spotlight as  a tv character has had its ups and downs i've  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,475680,479520,made mistakes like every human being and i've  made choices to speak up for myself when i felt  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,479520,484080,i was wrong every time i do though my narrative  gets twisted to fit someone else's story better  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,484080,488639,i'm tired of defending myself i'm tired of the  internet trolls i'm tired of people not knowing  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,488640,493040,who i really am because of what others have to  say about me when they are not even happy with  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,493040,497440,themselves i don't need the internet to live a  good life i made a mistake of responding to yet  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,497440,501600,again another post caused by the same person  trying to harm me over things that occurred  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,501600,506240,years ago if they are so happy with their lives  why bring me up again therefore since i can never  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,506240,510720,get my point across without being put in a corner  i will remove myself i will be deleting my twitter  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,510720,515039,as nothing good or positive has ever came from it  i wish everyone the best and then the next day we  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,515039,520159,"see a message from India Farrah's husband who on  an instagram story wrote, Derrick Barry Alexis  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,520159,524800,"Mateo, Shea you all have some really sad lives  you say you are against people who bully and  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,524800,529120,y'all are setting the perfect example of being  one y'all don't stand for anything but hate db  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,529120,534320,can't stand being a one-trick pony and is a  huge fan and clearly can't take a bite back...  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,535760,542400,Not a bite back sorry... I haven't read this  yet. AM still thinks she should have won and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,542400,548160,that she's slaying so she has to have groupies  with her because her career like DB relies on  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,548160,553199,India and Shea just can never win so she needs  to play the race card to distract them from the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,553200,559520,truth which they are all still holding on to good  for you girls girl show this new generation how  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,559520,564960,you shall bully someone very well done #RPDR  i hope you are very proud of your girls during  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,564960,570160,this pride month your cast couldn't wait for this  moment and it's clear as daylight best part is no  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,570160,574079,[ __ ] can read her for her talent exactly what  y'all are missing if they say these things about  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,574080,578800,her imagine what they say about you when they turn  their heads i rest my case switch the narrative on  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,578800,584800,"her so y'all look like the queens you always  wanted to be ""Envidiosas"" #TalentlessMonsters  "
Xw_WLSnBE8o,585440,589040,and it may also be worth noting some  other queens jumped in on the drama;  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,589040,593440,Roxxy tweeted what is this India everyone's  talking about is it a dentist? And Jiggly  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,593440,598960,replied nope apparently it sells popcorn at music  festivals and calls it her booked and busy gigs  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,600080,605120,and that is everything that happened with the feud  objectively speaking it was pretty clear that on  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,605120,611440,the pit stop Derrick and bob were sharing a joke  about an iconic drag race moment and Derrick was  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,611440,616240,polite she didnt really say anything. India was  the one who jumped on twitter with the insults  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,616240,621680,sometimes like india said removing yourself is  the best and only option wow wait imagine the  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,621680,626480,conspiracy theory behind this though that this is  actually just another ruse by world of wonder and  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,626480,634320,drag race to promote the drag race live in vegas  show oh we're all being tricked life is a lie  
Xw_WLSnBE8o,634320,638800,the world is an illusion and i don't know it's  real anymore but as always i want to say thank
