K6knVq8OfgY,240,3060,Food prices in the US soared to record heights in
K6knVq8OfgY,3060,4560,February 2022.
K6knVq8OfgY,4950,7920,"Global food prices also followed suit, posting a"
K6knVq8OfgY,7920,10920,20.7% increase compared to last year.
K6knVq8OfgY,10950,14100,Highest prices we've seen since probably for the last
K6knVq8OfgY,14100,18540,"ten years. Stock levels, lowest levels since, in some"
K6knVq8OfgY,18540,21300,"cases 2007,2008."
K6knVq8OfgY,21300,24599,It's particularly severe because we are just coming
K6knVq8OfgY,24600,27990,"out of a recovery from a two year, two and a half"
K6knVq8OfgY,27990,32400,year pandemic that had severe implications on the
K6knVq8OfgY,32400,34950,"price of goods and services, as well as the"
K6knVq8OfgY,34950,36240,price of commodities.
K6knVq8OfgY,36240,40680,Coming right out of that kind of historic
K6knVq8OfgY,41400,43020,disturbance of the world.
K6knVq8OfgY,43020,47800,Boom were hit with a really huge geopolitical event.
K6knVq8OfgY,47820,50250,The war in Ukraine is putting a massive strain on
K6knVq8OfgY,50250,51630,the global food supply.
K6knVq8OfgY,51660,54510,The chief of UN World Food Program warned that a
K6knVq8OfgY,54510,56730,potential global food crisis might be on the
K6knVq8OfgY,56730,59940,horizon on a scale not seen since World War Two.
K6knVq8OfgY,59940,64290,Some estimates place the total caloric value
K6knVq8OfgY,64589,68939,of the food exports from the Ukraine and Russia at
K6knVq8OfgY,68940,72720,around 12% of the globe's total calories.
K6knVq8OfgY,73080,76620,The Ukrainians can't plant right now and can't get
K6knVq8OfgY,76620,77970,their wheat in the ground.
K6knVq8OfgY,77970,81990,It does mean that the 2022 planting season will not
K6knVq8OfgY,81990,85860,yield much if they get some in or the size harvest that
K6knVq8OfgY,85860,87630,the world is anticipating.
K6knVq8OfgY,87630,89850,This is going to be another major test of the food
K6knVq8OfgY,89850,90900,supply system.
K6knVq8OfgY,91170,93630,We will have to watch very carefully what's happening
K6knVq8OfgY,93630,97829,in other parts of the world and consider ways to
K6knVq8OfgY,97890,102330,reduce risks of food shortages and conflict.
K6knVq8OfgY,102390,103290,This is going to be very challenging.
K6knVq8OfgY,104070,107040,So how exactly does the conflict in Ukraine pose a
K6knVq8OfgY,107040,109980,"threat to the global food supply, and can anything be"
K6knVq8OfgY,109980,111120,done to stop it?
K6knVq8OfgY,114250,116650,Russia and Ukraine are agricultural giants that
K6knVq8OfgY,116650,119500,provide a pivotal role in the global food supply.
K6knVq8OfgY,119800,124030,"In 2021, Russia exported $37.3 billion worth of"
K6knVq8OfgY,124030,126729,"agricultural products to the rest of the world, while"
K6knVq8OfgY,126730,129460,Ukraine exported more than 27 billion.
K6knVq8OfgY,129490,132070,They regained their role as one of the primary bread
K6knVq8OfgY,132070,133480,baskets of the world.
K6knVq8OfgY,133600,136120,"They're not only large in wheat, but also in things"
K6knVq8OfgY,136120,140140,"like corn, where they account for some 20-25% of"
K6knVq8OfgY,140140,141680,corn exported in the world.
K6knVq8OfgY,141700,144879,"Sunflower oil, where the two countries account for"
K6knVq8OfgY,144880,146130,almost 75%.
K6knVq8OfgY,146140,149950,So a lot of nations depend on exports from those two
K6knVq8OfgY,149950,150640,countries.
K6knVq8OfgY,150640,153430,But the Russian invasion has had a drastic impact on
K6knVq8OfgY,153430,154599,Ukraine's agricultural exports.
K6knVq8OfgY,155590,158319,"The country banned exports of several grains, sugar,"
K6knVq8OfgY,158320,159760,salt and meat in early March.
K6knVq8OfgY,160480,162730,The blockade of the country's port has also
K6knVq8OfgY,162730,165129,halted the shipment of existing grains.
K6knVq8OfgY,165430,168129,"As a result, Ukrainian grain exports in March were"
K6knVq8OfgY,168160,170940,four times less compared to the levels in February.
K6knVq8OfgY,170950,172780,To ship 9% of the world's grains.
K6knVq8OfgY,173710,176570,When you don't have a seaport is quite difficult.
K6knVq8OfgY,176590,179680,Now there's some talk about shipping on trains or on
K6knVq8OfgY,179680,182530,"land, but it's not a substitute for the massive"
K6knVq8OfgY,182530,185170,kinds of shipping that was existing before.
K6knVq8OfgY,185200,187300,There's also the question of whether Ukraine could
K6knVq8OfgY,187300,190210,"maintain its agricultural productivity, given its"
K6knVq8OfgY,190210,191500,current predicament.
K6knVq8OfgY,191530,195610,"It's a really topsy turvy, uncertain situation."
K6knVq8OfgY,195910,198250,Maybe in the far western part of Ukraine.
K6knVq8OfgY,198250,200230,"The security system is pretty good, but are they"
K6knVq8OfgY,200230,202390,going to have the availability of diesel fuel
K6knVq8OfgY,202420,205900,to get the tillage and the planting done?
K6knVq8OfgY,206200,209379,And we also know a lot of farmers are probably joined
K6knVq8OfgY,209380,211570,the Ukrainian military so there could be labor
K6knVq8OfgY,211570,212370,shortages.
K6knVq8OfgY,212680,215260,While Russia has yet to impose a wide export ban on
K6knVq8OfgY,215260,216620,agricultural goods.
K6knVq8OfgY,216640,219400,Its involvement in Ukraine has put a massive strain on
K6knVq8OfgY,219400,221049,the cost of fertilizers.
K6knVq8OfgY,221440,224050,"Prices for raw materials like ammonia, nitrogen"
K6knVq8OfgY,224050,227770,"nitrate, phosphate, potash and sulfate saw a 30%"
K6knVq8OfgY,227770,230290,increase compared to the start of 2022.
K6knVq8OfgY,230320,234730,Russia and Belarus are big exporters of
K6knVq8OfgY,234940,238510,"fertilizers in the world, and fertilizer prices have"
K6knVq8OfgY,238510,239650,been very high.
K6knVq8OfgY,239680,242739,"Natural gas prices have been very high, and natural"
K6knVq8OfgY,242740,247000,gas is a feedstock for nitrogen based fertilizers.
K6knVq8OfgY,247030,249430,"In early March, the Russian ministry recommended the"
K6knVq8OfgY,249430,252010,country's fertilizer producers temporarily halt
K6knVq8OfgY,252010,253060,any exports.
K6knVq8OfgY,253060,255340,If the price of fertilizer goes up.
K6knVq8OfgY,255370,258729,"You know, that might be a relatively small price in"
K6knVq8OfgY,258730,262410,terms of input costs that might get transferred to
K6knVq8OfgY,262420,265510,consumers. But if less fertilizer is produced and
K6knVq8OfgY,265510,269110,"less fertilizer is applied to crops, we might have"
K6knVq8OfgY,269110,272889,lower yields. And so that could affect total global
K6knVq8OfgY,272890,274720,supply of important food commodities.
K6knVq8OfgY,277180,280090,The global food supply was already in a fragile state
K6knVq8OfgY,280090,282790,before the crisis in Ukraine due to global
K6knVq8OfgY,282790,285610,warming as well as supply chain disruptions caused by
K6knVq8OfgY,285610,286330,the pandemic.
K6knVq8OfgY,286360,288909,"You've got to realize that even prior to the invasion,"
K6knVq8OfgY,288940,290200,global food stocks were tight.
K6knVq8OfgY,290620,293650,"That is, we have run down levels over the last couple"
K6knVq8OfgY,293650,296290,"of years, part of that due to the pandemic, but some of"
K6knVq8OfgY,296290,298330,it due to the fact that we had weather issues.
K6knVq8OfgY,298330,301150,We had a drought in the  North America that affected
K6knVq8OfgY,301150,304509,the wheat crop last year in Canada and parts of the US.
K6knVq8OfgY,304540,307360,We're just coming out of a drought in South America
K6knVq8OfgY,307360,309580,"which is adversely affected, the Brazil soybean"
K6knVq8OfgY,309580,313270,crop and Brazil's the largest soybean exporter in
K6knVq8OfgY,313270,313750,the world.
K6knVq8OfgY,313750,318160,Coming right out of that kind of historic
K6knVq8OfgY,318820,322480,"disturbance of the world, boom were hit with a really"
K6knVq8OfgY,322480,324400,huge geopolitical event.
K6knVq8OfgY,324430,327250,"In response, food costs have climbed to its highest level"
K6knVq8OfgY,327250,330430,"in nearly two years, while prices for commodities like"
K6knVq8OfgY,330430,333220,wheat and corn have reached the highest it's been in a
K6knVq8OfgY,333220,336520,decade. The US Department of Agriculture predicts that
K6knVq8OfgY,336520,339580,food at home prices will see an increase of up to 4%
K6knVq8OfgY,339580,341199,by the end of 2022.
K6knVq8OfgY,341200,344200,The United States is already experiencing very high
K6knVq8OfgY,344200,347350,inflation on food and energy prices.
K6knVq8OfgY,347590,350830,There is no question that the war in Ukraine will
K6knVq8OfgY,350830,354729,accelerate the increase in prices in both commodities.
K6knVq8OfgY,354730,357550,"That is food, the bread you buy in your grocery store,"
K6knVq8OfgY,357610,360870,the gasoline that you have to put in your car or truck.
K6knVq8OfgY,360880,363490,The United States is a net exporter of a lot of the
K6knVq8OfgY,363490,364630,grains that we're talking about.
K6knVq8OfgY,366430,370030,Those exports are still are affected by world prices.
K6knVq8OfgY,370030,372160,So we're still going to see increased prices.
K6knVq8OfgY,372160,375720,"And again, energy prices are world prices as well,"
K6knVq8OfgY,375720,376830,and those are going up.
K6knVq8OfgY,376830,381099,"As consumers,when there's a really large increase in"
K6knVq8OfgY,381100,384820,"energy prices, consumers are going to definitely see"
K6knVq8OfgY,384820,388210,that in their prices because that affects every
K6knVq8OfgY,388210,390729,stage of the supply chain.
K6knVq8OfgY,390730,393610,"While prices might rise, experts reassure that a food"
K6knVq8OfgY,393610,396639,shortage is unlikely to occur in the United States.
K6knVq8OfgY,396640,400330,The US does import very much from from Ukraine a little
K6knVq8OfgY,400330,403360,"bit of sunflower oil, but we grow a lot of soybeans"
K6knVq8OfgY,403360,406270,and other so called oilseeds that we're able to
K6knVq8OfgY,406270,409419,get vegetable oil. So the lack of vegetable oil from
K6knVq8OfgY,409420,414040,Ukraine itself is doesn't have much impact on on us
K6knVq8OfgY,414040,414700,consumers.
K6knVq8OfgY,414730,417790,I can say with some real confidence that in the
K6knVq8OfgY,417790,422530,"United States, the average consumer is not going to see"
K6knVq8OfgY,422530,424570,a shortage of bread.
K6knVq8OfgY,424570,429460,We may see some shelves that are empty for
K6knVq8OfgY,429460,432370,various kinds of food products like we have as we
K6knVq8OfgY,432370,433870,recover from the pandemic.
K6knVq8OfgY,433870,436419,While richer countries have the resources to offset the
K6knVq8OfgY,436420,439300,"shortage caused by the crisis in Ukraine, a strain"
K6knVq8OfgY,439300,441069,on the global food supply could still hurt
K6knVq8OfgY,441070,443590,"marginalized populations, as well as developing"
K6knVq8OfgY,443590,446230,countries that are forced to rely heavily on imported
K6knVq8OfgY,446230,446710,food.
K6knVq8OfgY,446710,449979,I do have concerns moving forward of what will happen
K6knVq8OfgY,449980,453250,to households that are particularly vulnerable and
K6knVq8OfgY,453250,454870,particularly impacted by inflation.
K6knVq8OfgY,456100,458680,And I am concerned about countries that may
K6knVq8OfgY,458680,462280,additionally have certain frictions to global trade.
K6knVq8OfgY,462310,464980,There are certain countries that may be traded with
K6knVq8OfgY,464980,467650,Russia and Ukraine and don't have trade relations
K6knVq8OfgY,467650,469600,with other parts of the world where they might get
K6knVq8OfgY,469600,472600,these products. We could really see a lot of people
K6knVq8OfgY,472600,473620,suffering here in the near future.
K6knVq8OfgY,474580,477189,A global food crisis could also potentially lead to
K6knVq8OfgY,477190,478360,more conflicts around the world.
K6knVq8OfgY,478960,481180,"For instance, the Arab Spring is thought to be"
K6knVq8OfgY,481180,484330,fueled by anger surrounding the rise in food prices.
K6knVq8OfgY,484330,488979,"Egypt, Yemen, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and"
K6knVq8OfgY,488980,492160,"Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan and Iraq."
K6knVq8OfgY,492490,495310,So those are the main importers of wheat.
K6knVq8OfgY,495340,497410,Of course there are then others that get some from
K6knVq8OfgY,497410,498520,Russia and some from Ukraine.
K6knVq8OfgY,499390,502510,But just think about the size of these countries and
K6knVq8OfgY,502510,503740,many of these places.
K6knVq8OfgY,503740,505090,Yemen is in an ongoing conflict.
K6knVq8OfgY,505570,509290,Bangladesh is on the edge because of all of the
K6knVq8OfgY,509290,510790,refugees coming in from Myanmar.
K6knVq8OfgY,511480,514840,"Ethiopia is in a war with its province, Tigray."
K6knVq8OfgY,514870,518529,Lebanon is in an extreme state because of the crisis
K6knVq8OfgY,518530,519910,that it had over a year ago.
K6knVq8OfgY,520690,523270,Just think about all these places around the world that
K6knVq8OfgY,523270,524140,could blow up.
K6knVq8OfgY,524980,527110,There are several ways to mitigate a potential
K6knVq8OfgY,527110,529959,"fallout. Shortly after the invasion, countries like"
K6knVq8OfgY,529960,532450,"Hungary, Serbia banned exports of certain"
K6knVq8OfgY,532450,535120,agricultural products to protect their food supply.
K6knVq8OfgY,535540,537670,Experts say such protectionist measures will
K6knVq8OfgY,537670,538750,only have negative consequences.
K6knVq8OfgY,539890,542140,It might be a good short term solution for that
K6knVq8OfgY,542140,545950,country in the sense that it keeps wheat prices lower
K6knVq8OfgY,547180,550540,"in the country. But by not exporting, that means prices"
K6knVq8OfgY,550540,552459,in the rest of the world are going to be even higher.
K6knVq8OfgY,552460,555100,"And unfortunately, with things like export"
K6knVq8OfgY,555100,557380,"restrictions, they tend to be very contagious."
K6knVq8OfgY,557410,560949,We economists call this as a beggar thy neighbor type of
K6knVq8OfgY,560950,565090,"contagion. So if one country does that, then the"
K6knVq8OfgY,565090,566110,next country will get scared.
K6knVq8OfgY,566500,571180,They'll do it. And all of a sudden you've made a
K6knVq8OfgY,571180,575380,very difficult situation even more difficult.
K6knVq8OfgY,575410,576910,The best advice is do no harm.
K6knVq8OfgY,577300,579970,"That is, don't create additional restrictions."
K6knVq8OfgY,579970,583629,Don't put on export restrictions in other things
K6knVq8OfgY,583630,586450,that can further hamper supplies to the market.
K6knVq8OfgY,586660,589060,It's also important for other major producers to
K6knVq8OfgY,589060,592120,grow and export more food to help fill the gap left by
K6knVq8OfgY,592120,593290,Ukraine and Russia.
K6knVq8OfgY,593320,595990,"There are some things that markets do very well, and"
K6knVq8OfgY,595990,599560,part of that is increasing those incentives for farmers
K6knVq8OfgY,599560,604390,and producers to produce goods that maybe there's
K6knVq8OfgY,604390,606500,some shock to supply in another part of the world.
K6knVq8OfgY,606520,608830,The European Union has already announced that
K6knVq8OfgY,609040,612730,they're going to try to take some measures to
K6knVq8OfgY,612730,615760,"release what they call some of their set aside acres,"
K6knVq8OfgY,615760,618400,make it eligible for production this summer.
K6knVq8OfgY,619750,623230,There's been a big controversy about doing
K6knVq8OfgY,623230,626290,something similar here in the United States with
K6knVq8OfgY,626290,629380,what's called conservation reserve program makers.
K6knVq8OfgY,629530,631960,I don't think there's probably much we can do
K6knVq8OfgY,631990,635440,given the late date relative to planting here
K6knVq8OfgY,635440,637870,for spring planted crops.
K6knVq8OfgY,637870,642010,But there's a possibility of maybe making some of
K6knVq8OfgY,642010,644530,those acres available for winter wheat production next
K6knVq8OfgY,644530,644980,fall.
K6knVq8OfgY,645010,647350,Some policies might also need a reassessment.
K6knVq8OfgY,647350,648100,Given the current situation.
K6knVq8OfgY,648850,651430,I think it's time to really give a hard look at things
K6knVq8OfgY,651430,653140,like biofuel policies.

K6knVq8OfgY,657520,658990,biodiesel production.
K6knVq8OfgY,659270,662350,"You know, this is a time when vegetable oil prices"
K6knVq8OfgY,662350,666069,"of which soybean oil is one, are hitting record high"
K6knVq8OfgY,666070,669550,"levels. So I think an argument could be said, why"
K6knVq8OfgY,669550,674410,should we be putting 40% of our soybean oil into into
K6knVq8OfgY,674920,675589,biodiesel?
K6knVq8OfgY,675610,678700,"But as always, the most effective solution might be"
K6knVq8OfgY,678700,679720,in prevention.
K6knVq8OfgY,679750,683860,Do as much as we can to encourage the
K6knVq8OfgY,683860,687550,development of agriculture within
K6knVq8OfgY,688780,690370,"these poor, consuming countries."

K6knVq8OfgY,693460,694270,that we can do.
K6knVq8OfgY,694300,698529,What I worry about every day is that this common
K6knVq8OfgY,698530,702070,"knowledge that, oh, we will not suffer because the world"
K6knVq8OfgY,702070,705490,has enough food is maybe coming under question.
K6knVq8OfgY,705490,710200,"If this war goes on for a long time, or we strain the"
K6knVq8OfgY,710200,713740,supplies and that the less developed world which has
K6knVq8OfgY,713740,718690,"fewer resources, let so many people squander"
K6knVq8OfgY,719830,721150,this opportunity.
K6knVq8OfgY,721150,723790,And I'm just hoping that the world's development
K6knVq8OfgY,723790,727360,community uses this as a wake up call to do more.
