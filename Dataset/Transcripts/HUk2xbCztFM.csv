HUk2xbCztFM,504870,505771,Just spectacular.
HUk2xbCztFM,506571,508006,Most important time ever to have
HUk2xbCztFM,508006,509541,no doubles defense because if
HUk2xbCztFM,509541,510576,Tommy Edmund can get a double
HUk2xbCztFM,510576,510642,somewhere.
HUk2xbCztFM,511410,513378,"Sosa runs well, we might have"
