xL-wwsARusE,160,1920,hey guys welcome back to another video
xL-wwsARusE,1920,3919,my name is saints fan and today we're
xL-wwsARusE,3919,5920,doing something a bit different we're
xL-wwsARusE,5920,7200,not actually going to be talking
xL-wwsARusE,7200,10080,necessarily about gta
xL-wwsARusE,10080,12400,but instead we're going to be discussing
xL-wwsARusE,12400,16400,the supposed gta killer and look as you
xL-wwsARusE,16400,18400,can tell from the thumbnail
xL-wwsARusE,18400,20480,it's not what we thought it was
xL-wwsARusE,20480,22640,at least these leaked pictures we're
xL-wwsARusE,22640,24960,gonna take a look at it has all of us
xL-wwsARusE,24960,26640,kind of wondering
xL-wwsARusE,26640,28640,what the hell is this game even gonna be
xL-wwsARusE,28640,30000,and the reason i do want to actually
xL-wwsARusE,30000,32398,discuss this is because this game which
xL-wwsARusE,32398,35040,by the way is called everywhere it's the
xL-wwsARusE,35040,36640,everywhere game like that's just the
xL-wwsARusE,36640,37760,name of it
xL-wwsARusE,37760,41520,it was sort of hyped up to be a gta
xL-wwsARusE,41520,43760,rival obviously in today's gaming age
xL-wwsARusE,43760,45280,there's there's not really another game
xL-wwsARusE,45280,47760,that even comes close to gta but this
xL-wwsARusE,47760,50000,everywhere game it had people believing
xL-wwsARusE,50000,52000,that it could be
xL-wwsARusE,52000,54879,the gta rival that we desperately need
xL-wwsARusE,54879,56800,and the reason is because it's actually
xL-wwsARusE,56800,60559,from the x rockstar games president
xL-wwsARusE,60559,63280,leslie benzies he was one of the
xL-wwsARusE,63280,65119,original founders of rockstar and he's
xL-wwsARusE,65119,67600,actually worked on every single gta game
xL-wwsARusE,67600,69280,he's probably one of the biggest reasons
xL-wwsARusE,69280,71840,why the gta games are as big as they are
xL-wwsARusE,71840,74320,he was also one of the minds behind gta
xL-wwsARusE,74320,76479,lion but he left rockstar back in like
xL-wwsARusE,76479,79600,2014 or something like that to form this
xL-wwsARusE,79600,82080,new company to make this new game
xL-wwsARusE,82080,84240,everywhere and before we get to league
xL-wwsARusE,84240,86479,pictures just to set the stage for those
xL-wwsARusE,86479,88640,where that are unaware
xL-wwsARusE,88640,91759,here's the info that we knew about this
xL-wwsARusE,91759,92799,title
xL-wwsARusE,92799,95439,it was a real life ready player one so
xL-wwsARusE,95439,96640,if you've either read the book or seen
xL-wwsARusE,96640,97600,the movie
xL-wwsARusE,97600,99360,kind of picture
xL-wwsARusE,99360,101520,a game like that it's an open world
xL-wwsARusE,101520,103119,triple a game there's a multiplayer
xL-wwsARusE,103119,105759,experience there's also a multi-chapter
xL-wwsARusE,105759,108479,epic narrative like a story
xL-wwsARusE,108479,110640,there's user generated content in a
xL-wwsARusE,110640,112560,virtual sandbox
xL-wwsARusE,112560,114799,players can create their own worlds and
xL-wwsARusE,114799,116079,there's going to be deep social and
xL-wwsARusE,116079,117600,streaming integrations and that's just
xL-wwsARusE,117600,120320,coming from this little excerpt from the
xL-wwsARusE,120320,122960,actual developers of the game so
xL-wwsARusE,122960,125280,you can also see in this founders leslie
xL-wwsARusE,125280,126880,benzies former president of rockstar
xL-wwsARusE,126880,128959,north and key creative force behind the
xL-wwsARusE,128959,130800,gta series
xL-wwsARusE,130800,133200,so the fact that they had probably one
xL-wwsARusE,133200,135680,of the biggest names in the gta world
xL-wwsARusE,135680,136879,and then over the course of the last
xL-wwsARusE,136879,138239,couple of years they've also picked up a
xL-wwsARusE,138239,140959,bunch of other gaming developers from
xL-wwsARusE,140959,143360,other big companies so that's why there
xL-wwsARusE,143360,145520,was this big sort of hype around it and
xL-wwsARusE,145520,148000,of course because it's from some old gta
xL-wwsARusE,148000,150640,people that's why people think it might
xL-wwsARusE,150640,155040,be a gta killer but as it turns out we
xL-wwsARusE,155040,156319,don't really know what's what's
xL-wwsARusE,156319,158800,happening with this game so the leak
xL-wwsARusE,158800,161920,this is from chris clipel who is one of
xL-wwsARusE,161920,164959,the somewhat bigger leakers in the gta
xL-wwsARusE,164959,166959,community he's leaked some things but
xL-wwsARusE,166959,168480,he's also leaked some things that didn't
xL-wwsARusE,168480,170080,turn out to be true so it's kind of 50
xL-wwsARusE,170080,172560,50 on if you want to believe them
xL-wwsARusE,172560,175120,and look this isn't actually from the
xL-wwsARusE,175120,176800,actual developers
xL-wwsARusE,176800,178480,and chris doesn't actually give a source
xL-wwsARusE,178480,180000,so we really don't know what this is
xL-wwsARusE,180000,181680,from but surely this guy's been around
xL-wwsARusE,181680,183040,the community enough that he's not just
xL-wwsARusE,183040,185280,making stuff up so this is it's from
xL-wwsARusE,185280,186319,somewhere
xL-wwsARusE,186319,187760,we just don't know where so i guess
xL-wwsARusE,187760,189440,maybe take this with a grain of salt but
xL-wwsARusE,189440,190720,you can see
xL-wwsARusE,190720,193440,the picture is not it doesn't look like
xL-wwsARusE,193440,195200,a gta killer it looks like a fortnite
xL-wwsARusE,195200,197440,clone almost and that's sort of what's
xL-wwsARusE,197440,200080,got people a little worried now he also
xL-wwsARusE,200080,202239,had two more pictures which uh these
xL-wwsARusE,202239,203760,i'll just scroll through them we have
xL-wwsARusE,203760,206720,this one like a red rock canyon actually
xL-wwsARusE,206720,209200,funny enough almost kind of
xL-wwsARusE,209200,211360,a little bit you have to squint maybe
xL-wwsARusE,211360,212400,and imagine
xL-wwsARusE,212400,214720,reminds me a little bit of the gta
xL-wwsARusE,214720,216560,trilogy definitive edition in san
xL-wwsARusE,216560,217680,andreas
xL-wwsARusE,217680,219599,up by the the military base in the red
xL-wwsARusE,219599,220799,rock area
xL-wwsARusE,220799,222480,kind of looks like that the clouds and
xL-wwsARusE,222480,224239,everything and then we also had this
xL-wwsARusE,224239,225519,picture which is just a river through
xL-wwsARusE,225519,228400,like a little mountainous terrain thingy
xL-wwsARusE,228400,230400,but of course the art style it's it's
xL-wwsARusE,230400,233519,stylized it's it's not realistic in no
xL-wwsARusE,233519,235519,way shape or form could anything in this
xL-wwsARusE,235519,238159,art style be considered a gta killer and
xL-wwsARusE,238159,240400,again that's why people are very worried
xL-wwsARusE,240400,241920,i mean in this actual picture there's
xL-wwsARusE,241920,244000,actually some buildings and stuff
xL-wwsARusE,244000,245280,uh but there's like three different
xL-wwsARusE,245280,247280,biomes and it's just it's kind of weird
xL-wwsARusE,247280,248959,and i've seen so much hate on these
xL-wwsARusE,248959,250560,pictures because
xL-wwsARusE,250560,252879,this isn't what people were expecting to
xL-wwsARusE,252879,255439,have in a gta killer
xL-wwsARusE,255439,258000,but there is kind of some good news and
xL-wwsARusE,258000,259440,it's something i don't think many people
xL-wwsARusE,259440,260320,are
xL-wwsARusE,260320,261600,contemplating
xL-wwsARusE,261600,263120,let's just assume these pictures are all
xL-wwsARusE,263120,264080,true
xL-wwsARusE,264080,266720,they're probably not of the realistic
xL-wwsARusE,266720,268560,part of the game so like we mentioned
xL-wwsARusE,268560,270800,their idea for this everywhere title is
xL-wwsARusE,270800,272960,to be a ready player one
xL-wwsARusE,272960,275440,like game and in ready player one there
xL-wwsARusE,275440,277680,was two worlds there was the main world
xL-wwsARusE,277680,280240,the real world where people lived and
xL-wwsARusE,280240,281440,then you put on your little virtual
xL-wwsARusE,281440,282800,reality goggles then you went to the
xL-wwsARusE,282800,284560,virtual world and it looks like what
xL-wwsARusE,284560,286720,we're seeing these leaked pictures this
xL-wwsARusE,286720,289360,is of the virtual world and the reason
xL-wwsARusE,289360,290960,we know there's going to be two worlds
xL-wwsARusE,290960,292240,not only just from the fact that i'm
xL-wwsARusE,292240,293759,saying it's already player one but from
xL-wwsARusE,293759,295120,one of the
xL-wwsARusE,295120,297280,job listings
xL-wwsARusE,297280,299680,they simply state that their project has
xL-wwsARusE,299680,301680,two different art styles and we're
xL-wwsARusE,301680,303840,probably only just seeing one of them
xL-wwsARusE,303840,305840,this is again the what we're seeing in
xL-wwsARusE,305840,308479,these pictures that's the virtual
xL-wwsARusE,308479,310880,art style where you put on your vr
xL-wwsARusE,310880,312479,goggles in the game and
xL-wwsARusE,312479,314000,you're transported to these virtual
xL-wwsARusE,314000,315280,worlds that's probably where people can
xL-wwsARusE,315280,316800,create content and do all the crazy
xL-wwsARusE,316800,318720,stuff and as far as the real world i
xL-wwsARusE,318720,320240,honestly think the only thing we've seen
xL-wwsARusE,320240,321840,so far i haven't followed this game too
xL-wwsARusE,321840,323840,much but i mean this was the picture
xL-wwsARusE,323840,325919,back in 2018 i think when they first
xL-wwsARusE,325919,327600,announced the game
xL-wwsARusE,327600,330320,you can see this picture of you know the
xL-wwsARusE,330320,332000,face here of this eye
xL-wwsARusE,332000,334160,it's very detailed clearly that doesn't
xL-wwsARusE,334160,336560,go in that art that sort of fortnight
xL-wwsARusE,336560,339680,style of a world so i'd imagine like the
xL-wwsARusE,339680,341440,actual realistic world's gonna look
xL-wwsARusE,341440,343840,normal but this is kind of interesting
xL-wwsARusE,343840,345680,because we haven't really like this is
xL-wwsARusE,345680,346800,all this is
xL-wwsARusE,346800,348960,the first thing we've gotten in forever
xL-wwsARusE,348960,351120,about this title this game
xL-wwsARusE,351120,353440,and it's been in development since
xL-wwsARusE,353440,357120,i think like 2016 2017 or something like
xL-wwsARusE,357120,358880,that it's been in development for quite
xL-wwsARusE,358880,360160,some time so
xL-wwsARusE,360160,362160,it's release date actually could be
xL-wwsARusE,362160,364400,close to gta 6 which is another reason
xL-wwsARusE,364400,366400,why people are going to compare it to
xL-wwsARusE,366400,367680,that game
xL-wwsARusE,367680,370080,but uh yeah this is it's something for
xL-wwsARusE,370080,371600,sure interesting
xL-wwsARusE,371600,373199,and i don't know if you guys are super
xL-wwsARusE,373199,375280,interested in this particular title but
xL-wwsARusE,375280,376240,it's something i'm definitely going to
xL-wwsARusE,376240,379039,keep my eye out on because honestly it
xL-wwsARusE,379039,380960,sounds like a cool idea because even
xL-wwsARusE,380960,382639,though it does look like fortnite and i
xL-wwsARusE,382639,383759,know there's some like negative
xL-wwsARusE,383759,385759,connotations with that kitty game child
xL-wwsARusE,385759,388160,game blah blah if you think about it and
xL-wwsARusE,388160,389600,i don't know if they'll actually do this
xL-wwsARusE,389600,390560,but
xL-wwsARusE,390560,393360,or at least do it right but a game
xL-wwsARusE,393360,396080,imagine gta online you just play it like
xL-wwsARusE,396080,398160,normal regular old stuff
xL-wwsARusE,398160,400160,but then you actually go into your
xL-wwsARusE,400160,402319,property your house your apartment go
xL-wwsARusE,402319,404160,into your little arcade room your vr
xL-wwsARusE,404160,405919,room then you put on your goggles and
xL-wwsARusE,405919,408639,then you're transported into another
xL-wwsARusE,408639,411120,world it would be a game within a game
xL-wwsARusE,411120,413840,and if they do allow for community made
xL-wwsARusE,413840,416319,stuff and if in this vr world you truly
xL-wwsARusE,416319,418400,are in like an open sandbox where you
xL-wwsARusE,418400,419840,can do whatever you want i mean that
xL-wwsARusE,419840,421919,sounds like a win-win for everyone
xL-wwsARusE,421919,423440,because if you do just want to play the
xL-wwsARusE,423440,424560,normal stuff you know you have the
xL-wwsARusE,424560,426800,normal realistic part of the game but if
xL-wwsARusE,426800,428479,you didn't want to get crazy with it and
xL-wwsARusE,428479,429360,you know see what other people are
xL-wwsARusE,429360,431840,making and make some stuff on your own
xL-wwsARusE,431840,433840,then you have the vr world like in
xL-wwsARusE,433840,434880,theory
xL-wwsARusE,434880,438479,this could be a really awesome and fun
xL-wwsARusE,438479,441120,idea obviously look we have to wait and
xL-wwsARusE,441120,442800,see on if they actually pull it off but
xL-wwsARusE,442800,445440,it's it's a cool idea and despite these
xL-wwsARusE,445440,447360,these three pictures coming out
xL-wwsARusE,447360,448800,i don't i don't know if i'm gonna
xL-wwsARusE,448800,451039,necessarily call this game the gta 6
xL-wwsARusE,451039,452240,killer but
xL-wwsARusE,452240,454720,it could actually be a very fun game to
xL-wwsARusE,454720,457599,play in addition to gta 6 and maybe
xL-wwsARusE,457599,460000,that's that's what this game can hope to
xL-wwsARusE,460000,460720,be
xL-wwsARusE,460720,462800,but uh yeah like i said at the beginning
xL-wwsARusE,462800,464879,i wanted to cover this mainly because
xL-wwsARusE,464879,467360,again i've seen it called the gta killer
xL-wwsARusE,467360,469360,so many times and
xL-wwsARusE,469360,470400,i don't know is this what you were
xL-wwsARusE,470400,473360,expecting and do you maybe expect more
xL-wwsARusE,473360,475919,coming from the head rock star
xL-wwsARusE,475919,479199,north uh president that was there for 20
xL-wwsARusE,479199,481599,something years or whatever it's been
xL-wwsARusE,481599,483520,that made gta
xL-wwsARusE,483520,485919,by city san andreas four i think he was
xL-wwsARusE,485919,488160,on red dead redemption one like he's
xL-wwsARusE,488160,490000,been a part of all the big games
xL-wwsARusE,490000,491520,so do you trust in him i guess but
xL-wwsARusE,491520,492800,anyway that's gonna do it for the video
xL-wwsARusE,492800,494240,thank you guys for watching
xL-wwsARusE,494240,496240,i don't know how many more videos i will
xL-wwsARusE,496240,498400,cover on this particular game uh not
xL-wwsARusE,498400,500879,until at least we know a lot more but i
xL-wwsARusE,500879,501759,thought it would be interesting to take
xL-wwsARusE,501759,503759,a look at just one time
xL-wwsARusE,503759,506319,since we did get some leaks because
xL-wwsARusE,506319,508560,calling something a gta killer
xL-wwsARusE,508560,510639,puts very high expectations and honestly
xL-wwsARusE,510639,513039,i i don't know if they'll meet them but
