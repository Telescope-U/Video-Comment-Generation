WgHo2XgbDmo,30640,35680,and decided Vegas was a good place to move his  empire. The mob casino bosses didn’t like cocaine  
WgHo2XgbDmo,35680,40720,"being sold in their casinos, so Tony starts  building his own casino without approval from the  "

WgHo2XgbDmo,77120,82800,"We were both designers on Scarface 2 (Scarface:  Empires), so it was pretty devastating to lose  "

WgHo2XgbDmo,232880,238800,2008. This was pre-production gameplay footage  of Scarface: Empire. 21 seconds into the video  
WgHo2XgbDmo,238800,244560,the Elvis Presley song Viva Las Vegas plays and  one minute into the video this song Dr. Feelgood  
WgHo2XgbDmo,244560,249280,by Mötley Crüe plays in the background. I could  have muted both these songs to get ad revenue  
WgHo2XgbDmo,249280,254720,from this video but I chose not to because this is  the only available gameplay footage of Scarface 2  
WgHo2XgbDmo,254720,257840,and I wanted to preserve it in its  original quality for the world to see.  
WgHo2XgbDmo,258400,262960,"Since this video is copyrighted due to the  songs and I get no ad revenue as a result,  "
