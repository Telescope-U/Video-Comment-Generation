HRd3mHXP_CE,411840,416880,perform under pressure  you got to leave it all out on the field
HRd3mHXP_CE,416880,422960,everybody want the future but everybody  wants to be average
HRd3mHXP_CE,422960,429280,i graduated high school with the number  four grade point average in my class  however i went to one of the lowest
HRd3mHXP_CE,429280,434840,performing schools in my state  i never had any homework never had to
HRd3mHXP_CE,434840,440000,study  never had to apply myself i never was  pushed
HRd3mHXP_CE,440000,446639,people always looked at me like how do  you make it look so easy  well to me it was easy but unfortunately
HRd3mHXP_CE,446639,454319,that's the exact  opposite of how the real world works  see in the real world nothing comes easy
HRd3mHXP_CE,454319,461360,you have to put in the effort you have  to put in the blood sweat  tears if it doesn't hurt a little bit
HRd3mHXP_CE,461360,467280,if it doesn't sting a little bit if it  doesn't make you a little uncomfortable  you probably won't get very much out of
HRd3mHXP_CE,467280,472879,it when i arrived at college  i quickly realized that i needed to  study and really put a lot of time into
HRd3mHXP_CE,472879,478960,it  but mentally i just wasn't there  i was living way too reckless i was
HRd3mHXP_CE,478960,485120,nowhere close to being focused  those poor choices led me to drop out  and instantly
HRd3mHXP_CE,485120,493199,i found myself in survival mode heard a  wise man say  if you failed a plan then naturally
HRd3mHXP_CE,493199,500800,you're planning to fail and what i take  that to mean is  each and every day you're executing some
HRd3mHXP_CE,500800,506160,type of game plan  that game plan is either gonna lead you  to massive success
HRd3mHXP_CE,506160,511840,or massive feeling and see what the 18  year old me fresh out of high school  failed to realize
HRd3mHXP_CE,511840,518399,is that it wasn't going to be easy it  was going to require me to be all  in it was going to require me to apply
HRd3mHXP_CE,518399,523599,myself  something i never done in high school  something no one around me had ever
HRd3mHXP_CE,523599,528720,encouraged me to do  [Music]  and that's why i'm encouraging you to
HRd3mHXP_CE,528720,534480,dig a little deeper  to give a little bit more to try a  little bit harder
HRd3mHXP_CE,534480,539600,to go that extra mile and understand  that the reason why you're taking those  classes
HRd3mHXP_CE,539600,547120,the reason why you're trying to get that  degree  is because you are trying to design the  lifestyle that you want to live
HRd3mHXP_CE,547120,550720,you're doing it for your future self
HRd3mHXP_CE,552640,557680,i will conquer what has not been  conquered defeat will not be in my creed
HRd3mHXP_CE,557680,564399,i will believe what others have doubted  i will always endeavor to uphold  prestige honor and respect for my team
HRd3mHXP_CE,564399,570480,i have trained my mind and my body will  follow who am i  i am a champion i will acknowledge the
HRd3mHXP_CE,570480,577920,fact  that my opponent he don't expect me to  win but i will never surrender  weakness will not be in my heart through
HRd3mHXP_CE,577920,583040,all the bumps in the road in the stormy  weather  the heart of a champion you could never
HRd3mHXP_CE,583040,588160,measure they might have more talent  but they fold under pressure because
HRd3mHXP_CE,588160,593200,they were only out for the pleasure  the gold and the treasure they crumble
HRd3mHXP_CE,593200,598240,to better  or even lesser competition so the day  all of the excuses stop
HRd3mHXP_CE,598240,604480,this is where your heart of a champion  starts a worker  a believer someone that understands that
HRd3mHXP_CE,604480,609600,they got to do more  than less someone that knows what it  means to push
HRd3mHXP_CE,609600,615440,who am i i am a champion to my side i  have comrades  comrades that have been with me through
HRd3mHXP_CE,615440,622399,thick and thin through sacrifice through  blood through sweat through tears  never will i let him fall never let him
HRd3mHXP_CE,622399,628880,down and i will never leave an enemy  behind  because our opponent does not know my  heart who am i
HRd3mHXP_CE,628880,634079,i am a champion there will become a  time when you have to realize that you
HRd3mHXP_CE,634079,639360,got to put in the work  and you got to understand that if you're  going to do it you better do it with the
HRd3mHXP_CE,639360,645040,right attitude  because attitude is what's going to take  to get you to the level that you need to
HRd3mHXP_CE,645040,650240,be in beyond it  a champion has to be disciplined a
HRd3mHXP_CE,650240,655839,champion has to be hungry  no one will deny me no one will define  me
HRd3mHXP_CE,655839,661200,and no one will tell me who and what i  am and can be  belief will change my world it has moved
HRd3mHXP_CE,661200,666560,continents it has moved countries it's  put man on the moon  and it will carry me through this battle
HRd3mHXP_CE,666560,672000,who am i i am a champion  defeat retreat those are not in my words
HRd3mHXP_CE,672000,678240,i don't understand these definitions  i don't understand when things go wrong  i don't understand mistakes but i do
HRd3mHXP_CE,678240,684800,understand this  i understand victory and i understand  never surrender it  because no matter how bad things go my
HRd3mHXP_CE,684800,690640,heart my mind will carry my body when my  limbs are too weak  you got to understand within you is
HRd3mHXP_CE,690640,696000,greatness  who am i i am a champion who am i i am a  champion who am i
HRd3mHXP_CE,696000,702880,i am a champion today will be that day
HRd3mHXP_CE,702880,709040,so i'm here because when i tell you  about breakthrough  i'm not talking about something i read a
HRd3mHXP_CE,709040,714240,college course  i'm talking about i've been through it  so here's the first thing i want y'all  to know
HRd3mHXP_CE,714240,720880,this is the year of the breakthrough  this is the year to what this is the  year of the world  this is the year of the world act like
HRd3mHXP_CE,720880,726240,you hear me this is the year the word  this is the year the what act like it
HRd3mHXP_CE,726240,734240,it's hard when you're in the library and  you study and you read and you take the  test  and you get a 55 that's hard
HRd3mHXP_CE,734240,741760,so what i want you to understand about  the breakthrough is that ninety percent  is work but the last ten percent that's
HRd3mHXP_CE,741760,747279,fight  but you mean to tell me i'm going to  every class and i'm still failing you  mean to tell me i'm reading every paper
HRd3mHXP_CE,747279,752320,i'm still failing  that's the hard part the breakthrough is  the hardest part
HRd3mHXP_CE,752320,759200,because the breakthrough is not about  the x's and o the breakthrough is not  about the weight room  the breakthrough is not about studying
HRd3mHXP_CE,759200,767279,the plays and  the breakthrough that last 10 percent is  all mental toughness the last 10
HRd3mHXP_CE,767279,774320,the breakthrough is not about being  better than you're already better than  them  you're just not better than them  mentally
HRd3mHXP_CE,777760,783760,the breakthrough i'm gonna break these  boys why  because where they come from they  couldn't get up at three o'clock in the
HRd3mHXP_CE,783760,790000,morning they wanted to  they smiled at me they come from  privilege  they got the language they got the code
HRd3mHXP_CE,790000,796000,they got the rules they grew up in it  but they will not get up earlier to me  they will not put out more content than
HRd3mHXP_CE,796000,801839,me  beast mode one two three beastmode one  two three  be smoke i beat small my way to number
HRd3mHXP_CE,801839,810320,one  i need you to think about your dream
HRd3mHXP_CE,810320,816959,that big life dream  the people who dream and those people
HRd3mHXP_CE,816959,822560,who dream big  have a different kind of life than the  people who don't drink  [Music]
HRd3mHXP_CE,822560,827680,a winner is a dreamer who never gives up
HRd3mHXP_CE,827680,834800,dreams require sacrifices like my city's  expensive  move my car payments are high sell your
HRd3mHXP_CE,834800,840959,car and take the bus  this is dreams we're talking about we're  talking about dreams
HRd3mHXP_CE,840959,846320,whether it's fear or anxiety whatever it  may be i believe  that every single person is going out to
HRd3mHXP_CE,846320,853760,chase their dreams has those voices in  their head i think it's part of the  human experience  stop downgrading your dream to fit your
HRd3mHXP_CE,853760,859040,reality  and start upgrading your conviction to  match your destiny
HRd3mHXP_CE,859040,865519,stay strong have faith keep pushing  through i've said this before  and and i'm living proof of it is that
HRd3mHXP_CE,865519,872160,on the other side of your struggle  is something good on your other side of  your struggle is something better  on the other side of your struggle is
HRd3mHXP_CE,872160,878000,some sort of success  why would you waste one second doing
HRd3mHXP_CE,878000,884959,something  that wasn't progressing your dream  go after this thing called life and
HRd3mHXP_CE,884959,891519,don't look back and have regrets  understand that you're at a place in a  position right now with hard work
HRd3mHXP_CE,891519,898560,and valuing people nothing can stop you  i promise you  so your dream will cause you to go
HRd3mHXP_CE,898560,903680,insane  because what you want it hunts you every  single night
HRd3mHXP_CE,903680,909920,see the big dogs they won't give you the  opportunity  you're gonna have to take it i need you
HRd3mHXP_CE,909920,916079,to remember  your destination you don't realize your  dreams are so important because your dna
HRd3mHXP_CE,916079,922240,who you are as a person  is wrapped up in your dreams no matter  what happens you will not quit because  quitting is not an option because you
HRd3mHXP_CE,922240,927839,have a why you have a patch and you have  a purpose
HRd3mHXP_CE,927920,934079,your dna is in your dream  be the example for the crazy dreamers
HRd3mHXP_CE,934079,939759,in this world you have got to make a  declaration  that this is what you stand for you're
HRd3mHXP_CE,939759,945120,standing up for your dreams you're  standing up for peace of mind  you're standing up for health you want
HRd3mHXP_CE,945120,949519,it and you're gonna go all out to have  it
HRd3mHXP_CE,951680,958639,what you want exists  don't settle until you get it
HRd3mHXP_CE,964240,970160,you need to use guilt as your fuel you  need to start feeling guilty
HRd3mHXP_CE,970160,976480,when you're not achieving or striving  towards your dream you can use
HRd3mHXP_CE,976480,984000,the people that doubted your dream  as motivation when your dreams are dying
HRd3mHXP_CE,984000,990880,and when you don't have enough strength  to go  on i need you to stop
HRd3mHXP_CE,990880,999360,the procrastination i need you  to let go of our limitations
HRd3mHXP_CE,999360,1005440,so i'm here to tell you today that you  can have anything you want  be anyone you want but you're gonna have
HRd3mHXP_CE,1005440,1011120,to work  see dreams aspirations they're not  easily obtained
HRd3mHXP_CE,1011120,1018320,but one of the hardest things to do is  to keep going  is to keep chasing
HRd3mHXP_CE,1018320,1026160,people will give up their dreams for  certainty  but i'm telling you that your life
HRd3mHXP_CE,1026160,1034000,will start to change when you become  more committed  to your dreams than your comfort zone
HRd3mHXP_CE,1034000,1040880,stop being pushed around by the fears  in your mind and start being led
HRd3mHXP_CE,1040880,1046720,by the dreams in your heart  this is your moment and you gotta look
HRd3mHXP_CE,1046720,1055679,in the mirror and believe that  [Music]  ease is a greater threat
HRd3mHXP_CE,1055679,1063259,to progress  than hardship  [Music]
HRd3mHXP_CE,1064000,1070320,so take advantage of today take  advantage of tomorrow take advantage of  every opportunity that you have
HRd3mHXP_CE,1070320,1076480,to do what you want in life life's too  short to be working on someone else's
HRd3mHXP_CE,1076480,1084320,dream  and i know it's difficult to follow your  dreams  but it's even worse if you don't you
HRd3mHXP_CE,1084320,1092840,have to find a way to build your own  dream  or someone else will hire you to build
HRd3mHXP_CE,1092840,1099840,theirs  if you give up on your dream what's left
HRd3mHXP_CE,1100080,1106799,because the people who accomplish their  dreams in this world  stopped telling people about them and
HRd3mHXP_CE,1106799,1114240,started  showing them they never once gave up  on a dream just because of the amount of
HRd3mHXP_CE,1114240,1122400,time  it took to accomplish it no  they knew that the time was gonna pass
HRd3mHXP_CE,1122400,1128640,anyway every single  successful person that accomplished a
HRd3mHXP_CE,1128640,1137039,dream  will tell you that as soon as you truly  start  pursuing your dream your life wakes up
HRd3mHXP_CE,1137039,1142640,and everything has meaning  you are not a mistake you are not an
HRd3mHXP_CE,1142640,1148320,accident you were here for a reason  i know you're going through some hard  times i know life at times might feel
HRd3mHXP_CE,1148320,1154240,rough or you might feel weird or  things might be frustrating but it's not  going to always be like this your  condition
HRd3mHXP_CE,1154240,1159360,is not your conclusion i've got to just  take maybe five minutes to kind of just
HRd3mHXP_CE,1159360,1166080,unpack my story so that you have an idea  of who i  am and why i speak with the passion
HRd3mHXP_CE,1166080,1171919,that i speak with there was a time when  i was in a really dark place
HRd3mHXP_CE,1171919,1177039,you know my mom had me when she was 16  years old  i grew up without my biological father
HRd3mHXP_CE,1177039,1183200,in my life i struggled with years for  drug and alcohol abuse  and i just found myself in a really
HRd3mHXP_CE,1183200,1189280,really really weird and dark place  i had to repeat the seventh grade and  when eighth grade came around
HRd3mHXP_CE,1189280,1194880,i'll never forget hearing at a  parent-teacher conference  a teacher tell my mom that i was a high
HRd3mHXP_CE,1194880,1200480,school material  and i came to tell you that words are  powerful and when i heard that statement
HRd3mHXP_CE,1200480,1205600,i remember  feeling like wow you know like i am  really really a failure you know
HRd3mHXP_CE,1205600,1212000,like it's one thing to tell a student  hey okay you're about to graduate from  high school  you're not college material you're not
HRd3mHXP_CE,1212000,1218000,going to go to an ivy league maybe you  should go  to a tech school like i've heard that  right like different people have
HRd3mHXP_CE,1218000,1224240,different paths  but but how do you tell middle school  kids that they're not ready for high  school like it affected me
HRd3mHXP_CE,1224240,1230720,and i never forget going that next year  and  after a series of events a lot of  fighting a lot of struggling
HRd3mHXP_CE,1230720,1237600,that school ended up kicking me out they  got all bent out of shape because i cut  the electricity off
HRd3mHXP_CE,1237600,1244000,the next year i went to another school  got the report card at the end of the  year  and because i did not do well and i did
HRd3mHXP_CE,1244000,1249120,not put good in  when i got that final report card rs 1c
HRd3mHXP_CE,1249120,1255679,and my mom is this tall but when she  gets mad she turns into the hulk you  know  and i'm thinking like this is not going
HRd3mHXP_CE,1255679,1261840,to be pretty but i came up with a plan i  said you know what i'm going to change  my grades  so i went to the library i got that
HRd3mHXP_CE,1261840,1268000,white out i blossed off all the f's in  the c  i took a fancy pen and a ruler and i put  those small little dots and lines
HRd3mHXP_CE,1268000,1273520,and i gave myself all a's and two b's  then i made a copy of it and as soon as  i got home i gave it to my mom
HRd3mHXP_CE,1273520,1279919,she took one glance and was like boy  where your real report card at  i said mom let me explain she said no no
HRd3mHXP_CE,1279919,1286400,i don't want to hear it  i know what happened i said you do she  said yes  you probably lost it how you always lose
HRd3mHXP_CE,1286400,1292000,stuff and you went to the office  and they had to make a copy of theirs on  file
HRd3mHXP_CE,1292000,1297200,i said yo yeah you be knowing mama she's  like i know i'm like you know
HRd3mHXP_CE,1297200,1303840,everything she's like i know  [Music]  but at the end of that summer at the end
HRd3mHXP_CE,1303840,1309760,of that summer when my real report card  came in  it was really rough i never forget like
HRd3mHXP_CE,1309760,1314880,when i first tricked my mom  and she saw it she was like i'm so proud  of you she started crying
HRd3mHXP_CE,1314880,1320320,i even got emotional i was like i told  you mama make you proud  she hugging me i'm hugging her we got
HRd3mHXP_CE,1320320,1325360,like a breakthrough and you're probably  wondering like jeremy why were you  crying like you know you didn't really
HRd3mHXP_CE,1325360,1331120,earn all a's and two b's well for the  first time  in a long time i didn't feel like a
HRd3mHXP_CE,1331120,1337440,failure  like i actually felt successful like  worthy like  i felt like i was good enough and so
HRd3mHXP_CE,1337440,1343200,that was a bit of emotional moment  but it wasn't real because i didn't  really earn those grades
HRd3mHXP_CE,1343200,1349600,now when my school sent my report card  home and my mom saw it  she was in denial my baby made a's and b
HRd3mHXP_CE,1349600,1355679,so she called to school  i was like oh hang up the phone mama  hang up the phone
HRd3mHXP_CE,1355679,1362159,and again she's in tears  but now what was once tears of joy
HRd3mHXP_CE,1362159,1368640,now is tears of sorrow tears of pain  tears of frustration  and she's trying to figure out like i  wish my baby would just get it together
HRd3mHXP_CE,1368640,1374240,and i was so hurt but i felt stuck  i was depressed i was tired i was  struggling
HRd3mHXP_CE,1374240,1379600,i felt like i was an accident like  what's the purpose of life like why am i  here  you know i felt like i wasn't i couldn't
HRd3mHXP_CE,1379600,1385200,fit in when it was time to read i didn't  want to read because  somebody was going to tease me because i  wasn't a good reader we was always
HRd3mHXP_CE,1385200,1391840,getting the fights people was bullying  me  then there was a time when i was a bully  like i just struggled and i was like  what's the point of it all
HRd3mHXP_CE,1391840,1399600,and my mom's a great mom so she moved me  to another school  so now i'm i'm at the school now called  huntsville high this is my third school
HRd3mHXP_CE,1399600,1406159,for the ninth grade now i'm at this new  school  and i don't know how to explain it to  you but i got a group of teachers i felt
HRd3mHXP_CE,1406159,1411840,like they were weird  they were saying stuff like jeremy we  believe in you
HRd3mHXP_CE,1411840,1417919,i'm like me one teacher is like oh yeah  jeremy anderson i'm  talking my man ah this is gonna be the
HRd3mHXP_CE,1417919,1423600,best year ever i'm like  okay one teacher i had to ask them i was
HRd3mHXP_CE,1423600,1429440,like wait a second  y'all are way too enthusiastic did y'all  get my transcripts like y'all got the  right jeremy
HRd3mHXP_CE,1429440,1435120,they was like yup we got the right  jeremy but you're in a new season now  so you don't have to worry about the
HRd3mHXP_CE,1435120,1442000,past i was like yeah but you do know  about last year yep  i said you know that's my third school  they was like we're not worried about  that again jeremy you're in a new season
HRd3mHXP_CE,1442000,1448000,now  so let's not bring old things into a new  season  and they began to speak life to me they
HRd3mHXP_CE,1448000,1453520,began to encourage me they began to  affirm me  and because i was young and i was  immature i kind of felt like well you
HRd3mHXP_CE,1453520,1460480,don't really understand my story you  don't come from where i come from and i  try to build the wall up but you know  what knock that wall down
HRd3mHXP_CE,1460480,1465679,it's love you know what knocked that  wall down  it was perseverance you know what
HRd3mHXP_CE,1465679,1471679,knocked that wall down it was like  unwavering commitment and support and i  realized you could be black white purple
HRd3mHXP_CE,1471679,1478000,blue  green we need each other and if you're  showing up because you believe in me  and you see great things inside me like
HRd3mHXP_CE,1478000,1483200,maybe  just maybe i can do great things  [Music]
HRd3mHXP_CE,1483200,1489279,your mindset your belief system  is everything and it is so powerful
HRd3mHXP_CE,1489279,1495440,and so i came all the way from atlanta  georgia to tell you you were not a  mistake  you were not an accident you were here
HRd3mHXP_CE,1495440,1502000,for a reason i know you're going through  some hard times  i know life at times might feel rough or  you might feel weird or things might be
HRd3mHXP_CE,1502000,1507919,frustrating but it's not going to always  be like this your condition  is not your conclusion there is so much
HRd3mHXP_CE,1507919,1513279,more that's going to take place  there is so much more power that's  inside you if you make up in your mind i
HRd3mHXP_CE,1513279,1519360,choose to believe  that i can do great things and i promise  you my young friends  i got to a point in life when i was like
HRd3mHXP_CE,1519360,1524480,man i got these teachers  they must really care like when you  start having teachers that get diagnosed
HRd3mHXP_CE,1524480,1529919,with cancer  but they still show up to school one of  my teachers had arthritis so bad  she couldn't even write on the
HRd3mHXP_CE,1529919,1536320,chalkboard other teacher was going  through a divorce  another one that just buried her child  i'm looking at all these teachers that's
HRd3mHXP_CE,1536320,1544480,going through life  just like you just like me but they kept  showing up  so something inside my brain said
HRd3mHXP_CE,1544480,1550799,maybe i am worth it something inside me  said  maybe i can do great things for them to
HRd3mHXP_CE,1550799,1556720,jump through all these hoops  and go out of their way to kind of  connect with me for them to make these  sacrifices
HRd3mHXP_CE,1556720,1563120,maybe it is possible for me it's the  same way with you  [Music]
HRd3mHXP_CE,1563120,1569760,over the years i have become intrigued  and obsessed with the study
HRd3mHXP_CE,1569760,1577200,on one of the most undervalued  underrated superpowers  that exist in our world today that is
HRd3mHXP_CE,1577200,1583039,the study of the power  of the mind  [Music]
HRd3mHXP_CE,1583039,1590960,i don't think people really understand  the power that they possess  on a daily basis it's a muscle
HRd3mHXP_CE,1590960,1599840,that only needs to be exercised and once  exercised  its potential is limitless
HRd3mHXP_CE,1599840,1606799,whether you think you can or you think  you can't  you're right your mindset is how
HRd3mHXP_CE,1606799,1613039,you set your mind and every single day  we have a choice to move forward into
HRd3mHXP_CE,1613039,1620559,growth  or back into safety so  be deliberate only you can change it
HRd3mHXP_CE,1620559,1627039,use it well and it will lead you to  accomplish  the incredible be deliberate with your
HRd3mHXP_CE,1627039,1633679,mindset  believe that you're in control of the  outcome  if you can see it in your mind if you
HRd3mHXP_CE,1633679,1638720,can believe it in your heart  and have the courage to speak it then  you can pull it
HRd3mHXP_CE,1638720,1643919,into your reality so many people right  now don't realize that our minds
HRd3mHXP_CE,1643919,1651760,play tricks on us have you ever tried to  go to sleep at night and your mind has  been working  overtime have you ever been walking down
HRd3mHXP_CE,1651760,1658159,the street and thinking that someone is  behind you  our minds play tricks on us unless we
HRd3mHXP_CE,1658159,1665200,make  the conscious decision to develop a  growth  mindset we will be lost and we will be a
HRd3mHXP_CE,1665200,1670720,victim  to a mind that has been conditioned to  focus on what is wrong
HRd3mHXP_CE,1670720,1677760,to focus on what is missing to focus  on what we haven't got where does that
HRd3mHXP_CE,1677760,1684080,change come from because is it enough  you want the change  you have new goals you have new plans is
HRd3mHXP_CE,1684080,1689760,that enough  the secret is to work on your mindset  daily work on the way that you see the
HRd3mHXP_CE,1689760,1696799,world  otherwise you'll live your whole life  seeing the world through someone else's  eyes  you'll be a creature of circumstance
HRd3mHXP_CE,1696799,1701840,you'll be a victim of your life and not  the master of it  read books listen to audios like this
HRd3mHXP_CE,1701840,1708720,one start learning about why you do the  things that you shouldn't do  and why you don't do the things you  should it's all because of the way that
HRd3mHXP_CE,1708720,1715360,thing between your ears is white but  know this  you're in control of rewiring it  whenever you make the decision to do so
HRd3mHXP_CE,1715360,1721919,at any moment you can take control back  of your life and start creating a life  that you deserve  not a life that someone else has paved
HRd3mHXP_CE,1721919,1728320,out for you  you got to understand that there are
HRd3mHXP_CE,1728320,1736240,going to be many circumstances  that will require your full
HRd3mHXP_CE,1736240,1741279,undivided attention you got to go  through it
HRd3mHXP_CE,1741279,1748399,to get to it you have to  understand it has to be a unique
HRd3mHXP_CE,1748399,1756080,mindset setting a goal  and then going beyond it
HRd3mHXP_CE,1756080,1760559,realizing that there's work to be done
HRd3mHXP_CE,1761760,1771120,making sure that all of the strings  are attached and make no mistake
HRd3mHXP_CE,1771120,1777360,along the way now it's true that we all  make mistakes
HRd3mHXP_CE,1777360,1784799,and we will have many setbacks  but there's always room for a comeback
HRd3mHXP_CE,1784799,1794240,to understand this you must realize that  you must humble yourself but yet  be hungry enough to go after it
HRd3mHXP_CE,1794240,1802240,with everything inside of you  everything that is required depends on
HRd3mHXP_CE,1802240,1808720,you  having the mindset that regardless
HRd3mHXP_CE,1808720,1816480,of anything that is around you that is  surrounding you  that is trying to drag you down
HRd3mHXP_CE,1816480,1823760,you must have the mindset  you must be strong
HRd3mHXP_CE,1823760,1829440,you must be resilient you must be driven
HRd3mHXP_CE,1829440,1834640,and you must be able to take whatever's  coming at you
HRd3mHXP_CE,1834960,1843120,if you stumble if you fall  have the ability to get up
HRd3mHXP_CE,1844799,1851520,a winner is a dreamer who never gives up
HRd3mHXP_CE,1851520,1858080,it's important for you to understand  that your experience  facing and overcoming adversity
HRd3mHXP_CE,1858080,1866320,is actually one of your biggest  advantages  how strong is your why it's not enough
HRd3mHXP_CE,1866320,1874399,for you to just say i want to do well  you have to believe that you will do  well and you have to pursue it
HRd3mHXP_CE,1874399,1882320,you have to keep going when you run into  challenges  those who succeed are not fearless
HRd3mHXP_CE,1882320,1889919,they had to show up even when they were  afraid  [Music]  and i know it's difficult to follow your
HRd3mHXP_CE,1889919,1898159,dreams  but it's even worse if you don't  you have to find a way to build your own
HRd3mHXP_CE,1898159,1904559,dream  or someone else will hire you to build  theirs
HRd3mHXP_CE,1904559,1911360,if you give up on your dream what's left  see self-discipline begins with the
HRd3mHXP_CE,1911360,1918000,mastery of your thoughts  if you don't control what you think you  can't control what you do
HRd3mHXP_CE,1918000,1924960,your dreams are important they are  significant they are  valuable they matter you need to take
HRd3mHXP_CE,1924960,1931279,your life your goals your inspirations  your aspirations your desires seriously
HRd3mHXP_CE,1931279,1935840,because if you don't no one else will
HRd3mHXP_CE,1936720,1942880,you do have the power to create an  amazing future
HRd3mHXP_CE,1942880,1949840,it's okay to rest it's okay to take a  break  it's okay to take some time to pull your
HRd3mHXP_CE,1949840,1956159,thoughts together  but it's not okay to quit
HRd3mHXP_CE,1956159,1963600,see self-discipline is the bridge  between goals  and accomplishment self-discipline
HRd3mHXP_CE,1963600,1968720,is the magic power that makes you  virtually unstoppable
HRd3mHXP_CE,1968720,1977200,self-discipline is the center of the  universe for success  self-discipline is doing within
HRd3mHXP_CE,1977200,1983600,wow you're doing without they're going  to be times when you feel like you're  losing your mind
HRd3mHXP_CE,1983600,1991440,and you study for hours and you're going  to take an exam  and you will not pass a student
HRd3mHXP_CE,1991440,1998720,is resilient a student is disciplined  a student is committed a student
HRd3mHXP_CE,1998720,2005360,is consistent why did you start in the  first  place and what was the emotion
HRd3mHXP_CE,2005360,2010640,the feeling what was the science  and the psychology behind the decision
HRd3mHXP_CE,2010640,2015919,that you made  and nine times out of ten i can tell you  why you started you started because you
HRd3mHXP_CE,2015919,2022799,were  this is the year of the breakthrough  this is the year to what  this is the year of the world this is
HRd3mHXP_CE,2022799,2030480,the year the word  act like you hear me every dream  requires discipline every dream requires
HRd3mHXP_CE,2030480,2035919,discipline  you are your only limit your potential
HRd3mHXP_CE,2035919,2043039,is endless go do what you dreamed  you could do believe you can
HRd3mHXP_CE,2043039,2050079,and you're halfway there  some of you are interested in this work
HRd3mHXP_CE,2050079,2056878,and you like telling people you do it  it make you feel good but you're not
HRd3mHXP_CE,2056878,2064638,you're not 120 though  some of you are committed but just like  your side hustle
HRd3mHXP_CE,2064638,2070240,i'm just being real y'all i was fully  committed i left  everything and started doing it and
HRd3mHXP_CE,2070240,2076560,because i was fully committed  the world responded to that commitment
HRd3mHXP_CE,2076560,2084560,but you just interested you're not  really committed to it  you're not putting in 50 60 hours
HRd3mHXP_CE,2084560,2090240,when my wife got diagnosed with ms i  never quit doing  the work because i wasn't doing it for
HRd3mHXP_CE,2090240,2095839,people i was doing it for the kids that  i was doing it for so even with ms  she had to quit her job i'd take it to
HRd3mHXP_CE,2095839,2101280,another level  some of y'all are negotiating not
HRd3mHXP_CE,2101280,2107920,because of the company  you negotiate because you're not the  best at what you do and i need y'all to  go back and be the best at what you do
HRd3mHXP_CE,2107920,2113359,and then i need y'all to come together  as the best and then take this thing to  the next level
HRd3mHXP_CE,2113359,2119920,and there are some of you you know what  you want  you know what you want but you are not
HRd3mHXP_CE,2119920,2126560,personally willing to do the work it  takes to get it  what you're trying to do is do what  you've done on this level and get the
HRd3mHXP_CE,2126560,2132320,next level  you're trying to do exactly what you're  doing on this level you're like i'm
HRd3mHXP_CE,2132320,2137920,getting up every day  i'm putting in two and a half i'm  putting in three and i'm not getting the  opportunity the opportunity might
HRd3mHXP_CE,2137920,2143440,require three and a half  i'm lifting weights i'm eating right and
HRd3mHXP_CE,2143440,2149040,i'm not getting the opportunity it might  require getting up and working out three  and a half  it might require you saying no to your
HRd3mHXP_CE,2149040,2155520,friends it might require you changing  your diet  it might require you moving to another  city whatever it takes you got to be
HRd3mHXP_CE,2155520,2163200,willing to do it  and you keep saying you're not there  because of something else because it's  easier to blame somebody else
HRd3mHXP_CE,2163280,2168560,because now you don't got to do no work  when you blame somebody else guess who  got to do the work  they got to do the work but guess who
HRd3mHXP_CE,2168560,2173680,got the power  they got the power how many are tired of
HRd3mHXP_CE,2173680,2179119,other people having the power let me see  your hand  you want the power i'm just being real  hands down hands down think about what i
HRd3mHXP_CE,2179119,2186400,just said  how many you want the power let me see  your hands good right now  right down next to your crazy idea some
HRd3mHXP_CE,2186400,2191440,of the things that you know you're doing  wrong  that's messing up what you're doing
HRd3mHXP_CE,2194960,2202880,actually being successful or like moving  out of our mom's basement or whatever  we put so much energy and time into the
HRd3mHXP_CE,2202880,2207920,presentation  of not looking like that's the situation  instead of putting the energy
HRd3mHXP_CE,2207920,2213440,and time into actually finding a  solution to that issue and so at that  point
HRd3mHXP_CE,2213440,2219760,it was like okay i've been putting a lot  of time and effort  trying to pretend things are good
HRd3mHXP_CE,2219760,2226320,instead of actually trying to find  solutions and then  that's when i started to do everything i
HRd3mHXP_CE,2226320,2232400,needed to do to try to make money and  just really  when i say embrace it's not necessarily  like accept it for what it is it's
HRd3mHXP_CE,2232400,2238480,almost like okay  this is real i need to figure this out  taking your surroundings you take in the
HRd3mHXP_CE,2238480,2244320,people around you you see how they're  making money  and i just didn't like begging people  for money and so
HRd3mHXP_CE,2244320,2251040,i respected the guys that were like  figuring out hustles right and so  for instance there was a amaco right
HRd3mHXP_CE,2251040,2256880,down the street from me and so i would  go there and i would wash windshields  and make money  just try to save up enough money to just
HRd3mHXP_CE,2256880,2263760,be in a motel for the night and i mean  like the nastiest motel but for me  it was just taking in my environment
HRd3mHXP_CE,2263760,2270079,seeing how  other people hustled how i can do it  better someone taught me how to play  drums on buckets and things like that
HRd3mHXP_CE,2270079,2277200,and so you know i just tried to do any  type of hustle  that i could i just started to learn
HRd3mHXP_CE,2277200,2284240,how others were moving and kind of  adapted  throughout for me it's
HRd3mHXP_CE,2284240,2291839,it's opening your mind and opening  yourself to people i think a lot of  people  they are ignorant they are
HRd3mHXP_CE,2291839,2296960,like rejecting change travel  get out of your comfort zone meet people
HRd3mHXP_CE,2296960,2304560,from all different types of backgrounds  if you want to build a product or  service or company  that you want to build at scale and your
HRd3mHXP_CE,2304560,2311040,friends are  only the homies that you've been hanging  out with since you know middle school  probably should meet some more people
HRd3mHXP_CE,2311040,2316720,get to know them travel the world  you know and even if you don't have the  resource to travel the internet learn
HRd3mHXP_CE,2316720,2322240,about different cultures learn about  different people  you're at that computer you tell me what  you want to do
HRd3mHXP_CE,2322240,2328240,i tell you this is how you search this  is this is how  you find those resources now you got to
HRd3mHXP_CE,2328240,2335839,actually go and learn  you have to be able to show people that  there's  other options and that's what spreading
HRd3mHXP_CE,2335839,2344560,seeds is all about  showing people that they can actually do  something different it's real now
HRd3mHXP_CE,2344560,2349760,you have like these brief moments of  kind of peace  until like the next accident happens
HRd3mHXP_CE,2349760,2356000,right um  and that's just life in general you know  it's never going to be  complete smooth sailing one of the
HRd3mHXP_CE,2356000,2361280,things that i've noticed about a lot of  people is that they let  the hardships and the things that happen
HRd3mHXP_CE,2361280,2367119,in their life  failure stop them from like elia says  you know dust yourself off and try again
HRd3mHXP_CE,2367119,2374480,right and for me  i've just never let anything or  anybody prevent me from achieving what i
HRd3mHXP_CE,2374480,2379760,want to achieve  and so i've always had this relentless  mentality and if you say i can't do
HRd3mHXP_CE,2379760,2385680,something  if i fail if i you know mess up it just  motivates me even more i just become
HRd3mHXP_CE,2385680,2390720,even more hungry and so i've always just  had this  you know relentless mentality i don't
HRd3mHXP_CE,2390720,2395760,take you know no for an answer i don't  take  failure or accept failure at all and
HRd3mHXP_CE,2395760,2404720,it's just always been kind of  in my heart to not give up it's the  roles that grow from  concrete right it's like no matter how
HRd3mHXP_CE,2404720,2410319,terrible a situation is no matter how  bad it is  there's still going to be a rose that
HRd3mHXP_CE,2410319,2415359,grows from that concrete and i feel like  i was that  right no matter what my situation was i
HRd3mHXP_CE,2415359,2423520,was built for this  i was not going to let myself fail
HRd3mHXP_CE,2423520,2429359,right and i had that mentality and i  understand that  now that i grew from that concrete i'm
HRd3mHXP_CE,2429359,2438480,starting to plant my seeds  and there's more roses growing
HRd3mHXP_CE,2438480,2444079,what's so special about the internet now  is  really anything you want to do you can
HRd3mHXP_CE,2444079,2449599,learn like if you want to learn how to  code if you want to be a developer you  want to build software you want to build  apps
HRd3mHXP_CE,2449599,2456240,you can literally go on youtube and  learn how to code  and so what i would tell that person is
HRd3mHXP_CE,2456240,2461520,what do you want to do  tell me anything what do you want to do  right
HRd3mHXP_CE,2461520,2467200,now there's resources and there's things  online that can help you build yourself
HRd3mHXP_CE,2467200,2474480,into whatever that is  so i think that that kid at the end of  the day he has to have that kind of just
HRd3mHXP_CE,2474480,2480880,i gotta make this happen right here's  the thing no one can teach you that
HRd3mHXP_CE,2480880,2487440,at the end of the day man you really  gotta want it  you gotta really want it and i think the  problem is is now with social media
HRd3mHXP_CE,2487440,2493680,before  when i was growing up i didn't see all  these examples of people having cool  cars or doing cool
HRd3mHXP_CE,2493680,2500720,all the time like right and now with  social media i don't care if you're in  like  you know in the middle of nowhere you
HRd3mHXP_CE,2500720,2507040,can log on to instagram and see  just this whole world of experiences and  things the problem is it's like
HRd3mHXP_CE,2507040,2514160,oh well these people have it so i should  be able to have it and it's just like  man you don't see  the work that goes behind this man i
HRd3mHXP_CE,2514160,2520079,started my first marketing job at 14.  i'm 10 years into entrepreneurship it  wasn't until the past few years where i
HRd3mHXP_CE,2520079,2527920,started really  getting recognition for it right and so  people don't see  all that it takes to even get to
HRd3mHXP_CE,2527920,2533280,that point and that's the problem and so  they think it's supposed to be this  this overnight thing goes oh i started
HRd3mHXP_CE,2533280,2538240,llc give me money  no that's not how it works
HRd3mHXP_CE,2540640,2546079,this is a marathon this is not a sprint  right you never know when that moment is
HRd3mHXP_CE,2546079,2553040,going to happen  in your life where you find that passion  or you figure it out  the fun part is just trying a bunch of
HRd3mHXP_CE,2553040,2560160,stuff like  when you get to a point where you can  just try a bunch of stuff it's like hey  sit down make a list i'm interested in
HRd3mHXP_CE,2560160,2565359,all these different things  right okay i'm interested in these top  five things
HRd3mHXP_CE,2565359,2570480,now how can i do something that  not only am i passionate about with one
HRd3mHXP_CE,2570480,2579838,of these top five things  but also make at least enough money to  just get by
HRd3mHXP_CE,2580240,2587040,you know the saying you just got to try  your best i would say  that you got to be the best is being top
HRd3mHXP_CE,2587040,2592079,20  of your class good enough for you no  [Music]  if you want something you got to get
HRd3mHXP_CE,2592079,2597839,after it and then you will start  producing good results and then you will  build  confidence along the way let's just cut
HRd3mHXP_CE,2597839,2603599,to the chase here are 10 study  techniques that i swear by as a medical  student  they help me get into medicine and i use
HRd3mHXP_CE,2603599,2607839,these on a day to day basis
HRd3mHXP_CE,2609839,2615839,first you're going to study from the  testable core materials outwards  so let's say the box represents all the
HRd3mHXP_CE,2615839,2622319,information that is presented to you and  the star in the middle  is the testable material someone who  doesn't know how to study will go from
HRd3mHXP_CE,2622319,2629760,top to bottom covering every single  little detail  and when the exam time comes they  haven't covered like 20 to 30 percent of
HRd3mHXP_CE,2629760,2636560,what is testable whereas someone who  knows how to study will start from the  middle you know  study from the core materials that is
HRd3mHXP_CE,2636560,2641839,testable and then study outwards  and when the exam time comes although  they haven't studied everything
HRd3mHXP_CE,2641839,2647200,they studied what is important and what  is testable i know that you want to be  the best student as possible i want to
HRd3mHXP_CE,2647200,2653119,be the best doctor as possible  so when studying we have this tendency  to try to learn everything
HRd3mHXP_CE,2653119,2659680,but we have to make this mindset shift  from focusing on those long-term goals  to short-term goals and those short-term
HRd3mHXP_CE,2659680,2664800,goals when you're taking courses  is to pass and get good grades in every  midterm and every
HRd3mHXP_CE,2664800,2671119,every exams that is presented before you  and then those long-term goals will take  care of themselves  so how do you know what's testable or
HRd3mHXP_CE,2671119,2676560,not there are three ways of figuring  that out  first is to look for practice tests or
HRd3mHXP_CE,2676560,2681839,previous tests  sometimes the lecturers give you you  know couple questions at the end of  their lecture
HRd3mHXP_CE,2681839,2687040,to go over on pay attention to those i  also looked online in undergrad to
HRd3mHXP_CE,2687040,2692800,figure out if there were any practice  tests lying around i asked  seniors if they've taken the course and
HRd3mHXP_CE,2692800,2697920,if they had any  practice material i asked my friend  who's also taking the course
HRd3mHXP_CE,2697920,2704319,you know you've got to use your  resources to figure out if there are any  additional study materials that you can
HRd3mHXP_CE,2704319,2710480,use you have to think like an examiner  not a learner so when you're going over  the material always imagine in your mind
HRd3mHXP_CE,2710480,2719839,how can i test it in a multiple choice  format how can i test this in a short  answer format  and then try to learn that way
HRd3mHXP_CE,2720480,2725520,number two on the list is to write good  concise notes and then plan out your  timing for all your midterms and all
HRd3mHXP_CE,2725520,2731760,your exams  and then constantly evaluate as you're  studying so that you're not falling  behind  so for example let's say you're taking
HRd3mHXP_CE,2731760,2737839,five courses and before a midterm you  have to go over 10 lectures  per course and then each lecture has 50
HRd3mHXP_CE,2737839,2742880,slides  that totals up to 2500 slides that you  have to go over before a midterm
HRd3mHXP_CE,2742880,2748319,so you have to write a good concise note  that summarizes everything  that makes it manageable for you to go
HRd3mHXP_CE,2748319,2753680,over the materials before you write the  midterms so that you're not  overloaded try to write notes as concise
HRd3mHXP_CE,2753680,2759119,as possible containing keywords  and important information you know that  if you don't remember something from
HRd3mHXP_CE,2759119,2764240,your note  you have the powerpoint slides that you  can always fall back on
HRd3mHXP_CE,2765200,2771839,number three on the list is to use  active recall when learning  i made a video on this previously that  you can watch but let me expand on that
HRd3mHXP_CE,2771839,2777280,further here  let me start off by giving you examples  of students who don't know how to study
HRd3mHXP_CE,2777280,2782480,so when presented with an information  like mitochondria  is the powerhouse of the cell what they
HRd3mHXP_CE,2782480,2788880,do is without thinking  they're just right nothing's coming into  their brains  so what i do when i'm going over my
HRd3mHXP_CE,2788880,2794960,notes is what i read the information i  write only the keywords  and then as opposed to looking at my
HRd3mHXP_CE,2794960,2800319,notes i look at that keyword  for example what is mitochondria and  then i try to think
HRd3mHXP_CE,2800319,2805520,mitochondria is the part of powerhouse  of the cell  why is the powerhouse of the cell and
HRd3mHXP_CE,2805520,2811680,then i try to supplement information  from the lecture it's a power of the  cell because it produces atp
HRd3mHXP_CE,2811680,2817040,so i'm using all of my senses i'm  writing down which is my  you know tactile motion i'm seeing
HRd3mHXP_CE,2817040,2822079,things out which is verbal  i'm looking at my notes previously i'm  using my visual cues
HRd3mHXP_CE,2822079,2827599,and i'm as i'm saying it i'm listening  so i'm using also my auditory  uh senses and most often when you're
HRd3mHXP_CE,2827599,2834560,actively recalling you cannot remember  all the information  and that is okay because studies have  shown that just by attempting to recall
HRd3mHXP_CE,2834560,2840400,you you're creating that connection  between the information and your memory  [Music]
HRd3mHXP_CE,2840400,2847839,and number four i cannot emphasize this  enough reviewing is just as important  as learning new information so if i have
HRd3mHXP_CE,2847839,2853599,20 lectures to go over before midterm  for example  as opposed to going 1 to 20 and then  going back to 1 to 20
HRd3mHXP_CE,2853599,2859839,what i do is i go to 1 to 5 and then i  review one to five quickly  and then move on to six to ten and then
HRd3mHXP_CE,2859839,2865599,once i'm done six or ten  even more quickly i go over one to five  and then i look over look over six to
HRd3mHXP_CE,2865599,2872240,ten  and then i go into 11 to 15.  obviously you have to time this  correctly before a midterm so that you
HRd3mHXP_CE,2872240,2877920,actually cover everything  [Music]
HRd3mHXP_CE,2877920,2885040,number five is more of a mentality thing  you have to study harder for your  midterms than your final exams
HRd3mHXP_CE,2885040,2891839,you're gonna obviously study hard for  your final exam but you have to study  harder for your midterms  because that sets the tone for the
HRd3mHXP_CE,2891839,2897040,entire course let's say you got a bad  mark on a midterm then the entire course  is just a catch-up game
HRd3mHXP_CE,2897040,2903520,you're worrying the whole time probably  two to three months  worrying about whether you're going to  get a good enough final mark so that you
HRd3mHXP_CE,2903520,2909119,can  make up for getting a bad mark on your  midterms  [Music]
HRd3mHXP_CE,2909119,2914640,number six is having a strong mindset  throughout school year i'm going to come  across  as a little harsh here but you know the
HRd3mHXP_CE,2914640,2920319,saying you just got to try your best  i would say that you got to be the best  is your best
HRd3mHXP_CE,2920319,2926000,really the top 1 of your class is your  best  to top 5 of your class if the program
HRd3mHXP_CE,2926000,2931680,that you want to get into in the end has  less than 10  acceptance rate is being top 20 of your
HRd3mHXP_CE,2931680,2937680,class good enough for you  no so if you want something you got to  get after it  and then you will start producing good
HRd3mHXP_CE,2937680,2943760,results and then you will build  confidence along the way
HRd3mHXP_CE,2943760,2949280,number seven is putting the work in and  out working everyone which is kind of  counterintuitive to put it in this video
HRd3mHXP_CE,2949280,2955440,because this is a study technique video  but compared to someone who knows all  these study techniques but doesn't work
HRd3mHXP_CE,2955440,2960640,hard  someone who doesn't know any of these  techniques and is just putting the hours
HRd3mHXP_CE,2960640,2966960,in  studying and getting the information  into their brain is always going to beat  that person with better study techniques
HRd3mHXP_CE,2966960,2972480,i wasn't the brightest person in my  class so what i did was i  just literally outworked everyone how do
HRd3mHXP_CE,2972480,2979440,i know that i walked into a library  before everyone else  and i walked out of library after  everyone else i spent my time
HRd3mHXP_CE,2979440,2985760,studying on friday nights saturday  nights when everyone was going out  partying  and there was you know one other student
HRd3mHXP_CE,2985760,2992240,that was leaving the library at the same  time  late night and he is now a cardiac  surgery resident at u of a so
HRd3mHXP_CE,2992240,2999839,things like that happen so you just have  to outwork everyone if you really want  to be  successful
HRd3mHXP_CE,3000400,3006800,number eight is getting a serious study  partner and friend who wanted as bad as  you  if you think it's gonna be hard to find
HRd3mHXP_CE,3006800,3013920,them well  if you start studying late nights at a  library all the time you  tend to come across these guys it's hard
HRd3mHXP_CE,3013920,3020160,coming in early in the morning  and leaving late at night coming in on  weekends  but in undergrad i had a group of
HRd3mHXP_CE,3020160,3025760,friends who i really studied with and we  didn't really disturb each other  we when we when it was time to study we
HRd3mHXP_CE,3025760,3033599,studied we didn't interrupt each other  and when it was when the business was  taken care of we went out and had fun
HRd3mHXP_CE,3033680,3040400,[Music]  number nine is staying consistent and
HRd3mHXP_CE,3040400,3045920,staying on top of everything especially  in medicine where  there's like million things going on if
HRd3mHXP_CE,3045920,3051680,i start to lose track of things  i get super stressed so i have to be on  top of every email i have to be on top
HRd3mHXP_CE,3051680,3057680,of every  you know assessments and all the work  that i have to do in undergrad you're  dealing with five courses plus
HRd3mHXP_CE,3057680,3063119,your extracurriculars and everything  going on so you have to stay on top of  things so that you don't fall behind and  get stressed
HRd3mHXP_CE,3063119,3069119,let me give you an example of  consistency and why it is so important  you have student a and student b you
HRd3mHXP_CE,3069119,3075920,know student a  is working friday night saturday sunday  12 hours each  student b decides to work on friday but
HRd3mHXP_CE,3075920,3084400,takes saturday and sunday off  then that student b has fallen behind  student a by  24 hours so no matter how hard he tries
HRd3mHXP_CE,3084400,3091359,you know the next on monday starting 14  hours as opposed to 12 hours  on tuesday starting 16 hours that guy is
HRd3mHXP_CE,3091359,3096880,always playing catch up to student a  and when you're on a curve in university  and undergrad
HRd3mHXP_CE,3096880,3101440,you're just going to not be able to  compete against uranie
HRd3mHXP_CE,3104400,3109680,number 10 is effectively controlling  your anxiety and your worry  when you're going through school there
HRd3mHXP_CE,3109680,3115040,are two types of warriors  one is someone who doesn't study and is  worried about not studying
HRd3mHXP_CE,3115040,3120720,that the solution to that is simple you  just gotta study  number two the second type of warrior is
HRd3mHXP_CE,3120720,3127520,um  someone who worries despite having done  all their studies  and when you're in that position then
HRd3mHXP_CE,3127520,3135200,you need to  write down what you're worried about so  on a notebook  on an ipad or whatever you're you're
HRd3mHXP_CE,3135200,3140400,worrying because you're not  seeing what you're worried about so  divide a line halfway in the middle
HRd3mHXP_CE,3140400,3146160,write down what you can control and what  you cannot control  and something like what you can control
HRd3mHXP_CE,3146160,3151440,is waking up early  going to the library and studying for x  amount of hours
HRd3mHXP_CE,3151440,3157359,and staying focused when you're studying  what you cannot control  is the actual grades that i'm going to
HRd3mHXP_CE,3157359,3163599,get  from this course so if i'm worried who  am i going to get a b  am i going to get a b plus having an a
HRd3mHXP_CE,3163599,3168960,minus a a plus  you cannot control that just focus on  what you can control
HRd3mHXP_CE,3168960,3173279,and you just have to give up on what you  cannot control
HRd3mHXP_CE,3175599,3180640,i bet most of your people have sat in  this chair it's not about what college  they went to it's about their own
HRd3mHXP_CE,3180640,3189249,initiative  their own drive their own ambitions  their own curiosity  [Music]
HRd3mHXP_CE,3190480,3198160,i can say from the era in which i grew  up i don't give a rat's ass what you say  to me  okay you can only be ridden if your back
HRd3mHXP_CE,3198160,3204319,is bent  on my tombstone i want the epitaph
HRd3mHXP_CE,3204319,3212000,be ashamed to die until you have scored  some  victory for humanity many people
HRd3mHXP_CE,3212000,3217200,look for meaning in life as though it's  going to be under a rock
HRd3mHXP_CE,3217200,3224160,or behind a tree well there's my meaning  you have more power than that you have
HRd3mHXP_CE,3224160,3231839,the power  to create meaning in your life  rather than passively look for it
HRd3mHXP_CE,3231839,3237119,meaning to me is do i know more about  the world today than i did yesterday
HRd3mHXP_CE,3237119,3244000,that enhances meaning for me and if that  accumulates  and accrues daily in a month you you
HRd3mHXP_CE,3244000,3250880,know  way more than you did than just that day  later so that you continue to grow  my first question of me wasn't where do
HRd3mHXP_CE,3250880,3257119,i find meaning it was how do i create  meaning  and that started early early teens you  can draw a line in the sand between
HRd3mHXP_CE,3257119,3263839,people  who transgress but do not hold power  over you  there's a famous quote from martin
HRd3mHXP_CE,3263839,3269040,luther king  you can only be ridden if your back is  bent
HRd3mHXP_CE,3269040,3275280,when i grew up it was very common to  hear the phrase  sticks and stones can break my bones but
HRd3mHXP_CE,3275280,3280880,words will never hurt me  i haven't heard that phrase in a long  time i don't hear it recited
HRd3mHXP_CE,3280880,3287200,in the elementary schools what i think  has happened over the years  is we came to learn as a civilization
HRd3mHXP_CE,3287200,3294000,that  words can be hurtful that's an advance  in  in mental health what i see on the flip
HRd3mHXP_CE,3294000,3299280,side of that coin however is  people are less able to deal with the
HRd3mHXP_CE,3299280,3304799,very same people who are around today  who are around back then  who are calling you names i can say from
HRd3mHXP_CE,3304799,3310559,the era in which i grew up  i don't give a rat's ass what you say to  me unless you are between me and some  goal
HRd3mHXP_CE,3310559,3317359,then i'll have to navigate that some way  if there's a racist person  or a sexist person or a person with some
HRd3mHXP_CE,3317359,3322480,kind of  cultural bias i want to know that  actually
HRd3mHXP_CE,3322480,3328319,i want you to say everything you want to  say then i'll say okay that's who you  are that's how you're thinking
HRd3mHXP_CE,3328319,3335359,so now what do i need to do because  you're in my way do i dig  under you go around you leap over you
HRd3mHXP_CE,3335359,3340559,or do i go this way and then come out  the other side yeah it's longer it's  more effort
HRd3mHXP_CE,3340559,3346400,it's more energy but on some level it's  sort of the same  different day i can't say you're being
HRd3mHXP_CE,3346400,3352640,racist you're being like that's not  you got to navigate it i think high  school
HRd3mHXP_CE,3352640,3359599,that's where you learn how to deal with  difficult people there are people who  are  nasty you're going to have to navigate
HRd3mHXP_CE,3359599,3364880,them there are people who  you cannot interact with for whatever  reason or another they're going to be in
HRd3mHXP_CE,3364880,3371599,the cubicle next to you  in your workplace so i think we  undervalue the total social
HRd3mHXP_CE,3371599,3376960,pot that people are tossed into in their  high school experience
HRd3mHXP_CE,3376960,3384240,they want to say oh i could have learned  more but i had to deal with all these  people hey  having to deal with all these people is  now in your portfolio your motivation
HRd3mHXP_CE,3384240,3389760,for the guests that you have in this  couch  they they had some vision statement
HRd3mHXP_CE,3389760,3395280,and they have grit okay they got knocked  down they stood back up they tried  another way they got knocked down again
HRd3mHXP_CE,3395280,3400319,then they were successful either  measured by wealth or influence or or  just
HRd3mHXP_CE,3400319,3406640,joy in their life's passions for me  what i do for the public 80 plus percent
HRd3mHXP_CE,3406640,3414000,of it  is driven by duty  not by ambition that's how i view it if
HRd3mHXP_CE,3414000,3420400,that were the case this is how i ended  up posting  cosmos in 2014 andrew the widow of carl
HRd3mHXP_CE,3420400,3427200,sagan  who was hugely talented she approached  me and said  would you consider hosting cosmos i said
HRd3mHXP_CE,3427200,3432960,i don't  there's a dozen people maybe half dozen  others who would jump at this  opportunity
HRd3mHXP_CE,3432960,3439200,i don't need to do this i really don't  then i thought about it and i said well  i met carl sagan when i was 17.
HRd3mHXP_CE,3439200,3444720,i was applying to colleges he was at  cornell i had been accepted to cornell  but  didn't know what college i wanted to go
HRd3mHXP_CE,3444720,3451920,to and the admissions office saw that i  wasn't  totally in the moment there they had  forwarded my application to him
HRd3mHXP_CE,3451920,3458000,for his reaction and he sent me a letter  and i get this letter and i open and  says i understand you like
HRd3mHXP_CE,3458000,3463680,the same stuff i like do you want to  come visit the campus to help you decide  if you want to go to cornell
HRd3mHXP_CE,3463680,3469440,he met me outside his building on a  saturday
HRd3mHXP_CE,3469440,3476079,it sounded really cool he reached back  grabbed a book off the shelf it was one  of his books and he signed it to me  neil texas future astronomers signed
HRd3mHXP_CE,3476079,3483040,carl  later in the day i'm ready to go back to  new york it begins to snow as it does  often in december in ithaca
HRd3mHXP_CE,3483040,3489200,and he says here's my home number if the  bus can't get through  from the snow spend the night with my
HRd3mHXP_CE,3489200,3495119,family and go back tomorrow i'm thinking  who am i why why i'm nobody
HRd3mHXP_CE,3495119,3500799,but i was somebody to him and i said to  myself if i'm ever as remotely famous as
HRd3mHXP_CE,3500799,3506960,he is  i will treat students the way he has  treated me if we can fold this memory
HRd3mHXP_CE,3506960,3514880,into this this next cosmos then we have  a  way to justify who and what i am as the
HRd3mHXP_CE,3514880,3521839,next host  because a torch got passed  it wasn't passed in 2014 it was passed
HRd3mHXP_CE,3521839,3528880,in 1975  to neil tyson future astronomer i still  have that book
HRd3mHXP_CE,3528880,3535520,and what is an adult scientist but a kid  who's never lost the curiosity
HRd3mHXP_CE,3537599,3542799,i'll tell you the one thing that will  build confidence you need to actually  put yourself out there in the school  year
HRd3mHXP_CE,3542799,3548799,is letting go of what other people think  and living your version of life  because too many students are living a
HRd3mHXP_CE,3548799,3555280,watered-down version of someone else  they're living a watered-down version of  their friends how their friends
HRd3mHXP_CE,3555280,3561920,want them to be they're living a  watered-down version of what their  family  pushes them to be or what society  suggests them to be as opposed to being
HRd3mHXP_CE,3561920,3567839,their own person  so go all in on you whatever that may
HRd3mHXP_CE,3567839,3575040,mean what excites you what  what pushes you because our biggest  problem i believe  is that we compare our behind the scenes
HRd3mHXP_CE,3575040,3580960,to everyone else's highlight reel  we compare our failures to everyone
HRd3mHXP_CE,3580960,3587920,else's  highest points of confidence to everyone  else's successes we compare  our insecurities to everyone else's
HRd3mHXP_CE,3587920,3593680,highest points of confidence then we  feel like we're not enough  so go all in on you whatever that may
HRd3mHXP_CE,3593680,3600559,mean  the one thing that i don't enjoy about  my job is that i come to a school
HRd3mHXP_CE,3600559,3606960,and when i was a student in going in  to college i didn't see myself as
HRd3mHXP_CE,3606960,3614000,someone who could really make an impact  i didn't see myself as someone who could  really contribute it was only until
HRd3mHXP_CE,3614000,3619200,i started putting myself out there  sharing my ideas putting myself in  uncomfortable situations
HRd3mHXP_CE,3619200,3625680,that forced me to grow that i became a  beat  that contributed to what made my school
HRd3mHXP_CE,3625680,3631040,better because i was a part of it  realize that you have the ability to
HRd3mHXP_CE,3631040,3636799,make an impact  you have an opportunity to change that  story in your head  put yourself out there because when you
HRd3mHXP_CE,3636799,3642720,do amazing things happen  this school needs your leadership they  need your influence they need your
HRd3mHXP_CE,3642720,3646240,impact it is time to show up
HRd3mHXP_CE,3651680,3657599,we're all carrying things in our pack  all of us are carrying these stories
HRd3mHXP_CE,3657599,3665119,that are imposed  by other people by friends by family by  society by  instagram and what happens is when we
HRd3mHXP_CE,3665119,3671760,are faced with a challenging situation  we approach it with all of that stuff
HRd3mHXP_CE,3671760,3678799,some of you believe the stories that  you've made up in your own head  the story of i'm not good enough the
HRd3mHXP_CE,3678799,3684240,story of i'm not academically inclined  the story of i'm not a morning person  the story of i can't really make new  friends
HRd3mHXP_CE,3684240,3690079,the story of i can't really have an  impact on the people around me  and now listen i want to be abundantly
HRd3mHXP_CE,3690079,3695200,clear i'm not the guy that's going to  come in here and tell you what stories  to tell yourself but i want you to get  back to the place
HRd3mHXP_CE,3695200,3701280,where you can start telling yourself  better stories  stories that you are enough that you are
HRd3mHXP_CE,3701280,3707920,charismatic enough that you are  courageous enough that you aren't like  them and that's okay because you are  like you
HRd3mHXP_CE,3708000,3714450,i believe when we stop  believing the stories that we tell  ourselves in our own heads
HRd3mHXP_CE,3714450,3719520,[Music]  and start telling ourselves news stories  stories that are actually aligned with
HRd3mHXP_CE,3719520,3725520,who we are and who we would like to  become  that is when we were able to change  ourselves
HRd3mHXP_CE,3725520,3730799,and change the people around us but i  want you to raise the question within
HRd3mHXP_CE,3730799,3736640,yourself of defining the snake in your  life  that thing that keeps on coming up that
HRd3mHXP_CE,3736640,3744079,it is time to face because here's what i  know  every single person in this room student
HRd3mHXP_CE,3744079,3749520,and faculty has something that comes up  that tries to get in their way make them  want to quit and turn around and walk
HRd3mHXP_CE,3749520,3755280,away  and what i know to be true is defining  that thing for you  is the only way to be able to overcome
HRd3mHXP_CE,3755280,3760400,it  we talk a lot about leadership going  into a new school how do you show up as
HRd3mHXP_CE,3760400,3767680,a leader in the school in the community  around it  true leadership is leaning into the
HRd3mHXP_CE,3767680,3772880,things you're afraid of  true leadership is consistently choosing  courage
HRd3mHXP_CE,3772880,3778480,instead of fear true leadership is  having the courage the audacity to take  on challenges
HRd3mHXP_CE,3778480,3784720,things that don't make you feel good  while inspiring  other people to do the same it takes
HRd3mHXP_CE,3784720,3790400,courage to make a new friend  it takes courage to stand up for that  person that you see on campuses
HRd3mHXP_CE,3790400,3796160,isn't being done right it takes courage  to wake up a little earlier instead of  late to join that student group
HRd3mHXP_CE,3796160,3803279,to put yourself out there more than you  thought that you could it takes courage  to live a great life
HRd3mHXP_CE,3803680,3809520,so make the decision today of what  courageous act are you going to make for  yourself
HRd3mHXP_CE,3809520,3816000,and the people at the school  it starts by taking on the things that  you can actually affect
HRd3mHXP_CE,3816000,3822799,that you can control and that you can  impact because i see way too many  students  coming into college and university that
HRd3mHXP_CE,3822799,3829359,allow themselves  to be defined by what happened yesterday  they allowed themselves to be defined by
HRd3mHXP_CE,3829359,3834559,what happened last week some of you in  this room  think because of one failed test that
HRd3mHXP_CE,3834559,3840319,you are a failure when the reality is  those are moments not characteristics  and my personal belief
HRd3mHXP_CE,3840319,3845119,is that we need to start seeing those  moments for what they are
HRd3mHXP_CE,3850839,3857520,moments  you went to iu yep right now you got a  lot of people that  uh say uh forget about school you know
HRd3mHXP_CE,3857520,3864240,drop out of school there  it is so you think they're ready tell me  why um  if you're gonna have and run a business
HRd3mHXP_CE,3864240,3870079,if you don't understand accounting  you're already behind the eight ball  can't you hire a guy that's that knows  that but then they still have to
HRd3mHXP_CE,3870079,3875280,communicate to you  right i mean there's people that don't  understand the the concept of
HRd3mHXP_CE,3875280,3882480,you know the difference between profits  and cash you know oh  your account might tell you you're  profitable but your cash is going down
HRd3mHXP_CE,3882480,3888799,you know not understanding um the  breakdown and and when you don't  you think you need college to learn that
HRd3mHXP_CE,3888799,3895119,yeah i think you do right because  it may not for some people look if  you're so self-motivated  that you can take an online course in
HRd3mHXP_CE,3895119,3901760,accounting and teach yourself everything  you're way ahead of the game many ways  but most people aren't and i'm not  saying you have to go to indiana i'm not
HRd3mHXP_CE,3901760,3907760,saying go to an expensive school  i don't care if you go to a community  college and take accounting and spend 99  bucks for the class
HRd3mHXP_CE,3907760,3912799,just you know spending the money forces  you to be more obligated to do it
HRd3mHXP_CE,3912799,3918400,but accounting finance lesser extent  marketing  sales if the school offers that these
HRd3mHXP_CE,3918400,3923520,are all that's the language of business  and so while it's possible to teach  yourself these things and while it's
HRd3mHXP_CE,3923520,3928720,possible to hire them  when you're starting your own company  you don't want to have to spend money  hiring
HRd3mHXP_CE,3928720,3934160,an accountant and so your cost of  opening up a business drops but even  more important and all that that's
HRd3mHXP_CE,3934160,3940079,that's the blocking of tackling  that's the language of business you know  the thing i learned at indiana that was  more important than anything else i
HRd3mHXP_CE,3940079,3945359,learned how to learn  and learning became far more important  to me because the one
HRd3mHXP_CE,3945359,3951440,certainty in business is that it's  always going to be changing the  if you're not always learning if to this
HRd3mHXP_CE,3951440,3956640,minute  if if i'm not continuously learning if  i'm not just absorbing as much as i can
HRd3mHXP_CE,3956640,3961680,absorb  someone else is going to kick my ass  right so you're talking about paranoia
HRd3mHXP_CE,3961680,3966880,the greatest source of your paranoia  should be knowledge  if someone else knows more than you do
HRd3mHXP_CE,3966880,3974480,and if you're not learning if you don't  know the learner if you don't know how  to learn if you don't have a thirst for  learning  and acquiring information you're you're
HRd3mHXP_CE,3974480,3979839,sol  you know people like to say you know the  only stupid questions are the one you
HRd3mHXP_CE,3979839,3985119,don't once you don't ask and that's not  right  right because the questions you ask tell  me tell whoever
HRd3mHXP_CE,3985119,3992079,more about you than anything else you do  because in particular tells me about  your preparation  if you ask me questions about just basic
HRd3mHXP_CE,3992079,3997839,things that you should have known  and you should have down to a science  that's going to disqualify you almost
HRd3mHXP_CE,3997839,4004559,more than anything  do you think there needs to be a healthy  level of peril absolutely there needs to
HRd3mHXP_CE,4004559,4010559,be oh yeah i mean  i always say you know for every one of  my businesses i said what would i do to  kick my own ass
HRd3mHXP_CE,4010559,4016880,you right so whatever business you have  there's somebody trying to put you out  of business there's somebody trying to  to take a bite out of your business and
HRd3mHXP_CE,4016880,4023920,it's better for you to figure out how  they're going to do it rather than  they do it um and so yeah that's being  paranoid and so you have to be paranoid
HRd3mHXP_CE,4023920,4030080,you have to anticipate other people's  next moves and you can't ever  you know downplay the competition
HRd3mHXP_CE,4030080,4037039,[Music]  i was at a business plan competition  this morning for at a college  and they were kind of being dismissive
HRd3mHXP_CE,4037039,4043680,of the competition  and so you can't ever do that you know  they're out there trying to take you  down  and they're not just going to sit still
HRd3mHXP_CE,4043680,4048960,and if you're good really really good  you're going to inspire them to work  even harder faster better and so you
HRd3mHXP_CE,4048960,4055359,have to be  you know very self-aware of what you're  good at and what other people are good  at  and you know a healthy dose of paranoia
HRd3mHXP_CE,4055359,4063838,makes a video i mean  is very helpful
HRd3mHXP_CE,4064720,4069839,if you're not always learning if to this  minute  if if i'm not continuously learning if
HRd3mHXP_CE,4069839,4076880,i'm not just absorbing as much as i can  absorb  someone else is going to kick my ass
HRd3mHXP_CE,4076880,4082079,the greatest source of your paranoia  should be knowledge  if someone else knows more than you do
HRd3mHXP_CE,4082079,4089680,and if you're not learning if you don't  know the learn if you don't know how to  learn if you don't have a thirst for  learning  and acquiring information you're you're
HRd3mHXP_CE,4089680,4095920,sol  there's certain guys they have the  genetics to jump out of the gym right  for certain guys you know that you know
HRd3mHXP_CE,4095920,4102318,when they golf they have the muscle  memory and  and the discipline you know dirk um the  whiskey may not be the most talented guy
HRd3mHXP_CE,4102318,4109040,in the nba  but his discipline and his focus to do  what's necessary to be successful  he's willing to do and combine it with
HRd3mHXP_CE,4109040,4114159,being seven feet tall and being skilled  you know it makes him an amazing  basketball player
HRd3mHXP_CE,4114159,4120480,so it's understanding what your skill  set is  finding the right place to use those  skills and then
HRd3mHXP_CE,4120480,4127278,going for it you know will that make you  250 grand it depends if you pick the  right industry  but whatever industry you pick if you
HRd3mHXP_CE,4127278,4133758,outwork everybody  if you try to be a little smarter than  everybody if you try to be a better  sales person than everybody
HRd3mHXP_CE,4133758,4139920,if you try to be better prepared than  everybody you've got your best chance  because  if you don't do it and somebody else
HRd3mHXP_CE,4139920,4146318,does  you know i have the same work like  someone's trying to take it all away  from you you know work  actually work like someone's spending 24
HRd3mHXP_CE,4146318,4152880,hours working 24 hours to take it all  away from you  and that's kind of the way i look at it
HRd3mHXP_CE,4155120,4160480,if we would like to improve the quality  of our lives
HRd3mHXP_CE,4160480,4168080,personally and professionally what would  be your advice  what can we do what is most important
HRd3mHXP_CE,4168080,4174000,well the most important thing is  self-esteem  the people that we read about the people
HRd3mHXP_CE,4174000,4179120,that we uh  admire uh the elon musks the steve jobs
HRd3mHXP_CE,4179120,4184960,the warren buffets etc  all have one thing in common they have  extremely high self-esteem
