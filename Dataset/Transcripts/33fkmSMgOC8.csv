33fkmSMgOC8,140,2243,- I believe we will be the first to game
33fkmSMgOC8,2243,3750,on a development kit.
33fkmSMgOC8,3750,6440,Words cannot express how excited I am right now.
33fkmSMgOC8,6440,8960,I've completely sequestered myself.
33fkmSMgOC8,8960,11220,I haven't looked at any other coverage.
33fkmSMgOC8,11220,12930,"I haven't looked at any pictures,"
33fkmSMgOC8,12930,15280,and I have not yet opened this box.
33fkmSMgOC8,15280,19369,But inside here is an Xbox Series X.
33fkmSMgOC8,19370,21670,"Totally normal, except for the fact"
33fkmSMgOC8,21670,25000,"that it has 40 gigabytes of Ram,"
33fkmSMgOC8,25000,26670,"extra buttons on the front,"
33fkmSMgOC8,26670,31480,"an OLED display, and it looks absolutely nothing"
33fkmSMgOC8,31480,34440,like the Xbox on the shelf at Best Buy.
33fkmSMgOC8,34440,38090,"That's because this Xbox is not for playing games,"
33fkmSMgOC8,38090,39580,it's for developing them.
33fkmSMgOC8,39580,42660,"And because these dev kits, as they're called,"
33fkmSMgOC8,42660,44300,"are the property of Microsoft,"
33fkmSMgOC8,44300,47100,very few of them make it out into the wild.
33fkmSMgOC8,47100,48309,"Microsoft, by the way,"
33fkmSMgOC8,48310,50715,I know this is technically stolen property.
33fkmSMgOC8,50715,51660,We good?
33fkmSMgOC8,51660,53890,"Just give me a call, I'll have it back to you right away."
33fkmSMgOC8,53890,56899,But I do need to play with it for a little bit first.
33fkmSMgOC8,56900,59150,And play I actually may.
33fkmSMgOC8,59150,61930,Now Gamers Nexus recently also got their hands
33fkmSMgOC8,61930,63500,"on a Series X dev kit,"
33fkmSMgOC8,63500,66790,but they weren't able to actually run any software on it.
33fkmSMgOC8,66790,70580,"As for ours, we believe it may still be in working order."
33fkmSMgOC8,70580,73840,But all of this raises quite a few questions.
33fkmSMgOC8,73840,75409,Why do these kits exist?
33fkmSMgOC8,75410,77070,How the heck has everyone been getting
33fkmSMgOC8,77070,78540,their hands on these lately?
33fkmSMgOC8,78540,80120,Why does it look so different?
33fkmSMgOC8,80120,83430,"And of course, who is today's sponsor?"
33fkmSMgOC8,83430,84490,Humble Bundle.
33fkmSMgOC8,84490,86490,"That's right, we're partnering with Humble Bundle"
33fkmSMgOC8,86490,87799,to support Life Lights
33fkmSMgOC8,87800,89780,and the BC Children'S Hospital
33fkmSMgOC8,89780,92070,with their Handheld PC Power Bundle
33fkmSMgOC8,92070,94520,of eight Steam Deck verified games.
33fkmSMgOC8,94520,96000,Learn more at the end of this video
33fkmSMgOC8,96000,98164,or by using the link down below.
33fkmSMgOC8,98164,100747,(upbeat music)
33fkmSMgOC8,107000,108490,Either my left arm is way weaker
33fkmSMgOC8,108490,110079,or this thing is way heavier
33fkmSMgOC8,110080,111670,than the actual finished product.
33fkmSMgOC8,111670,114220,It has 10 gig ethernet.
33fkmSMgOC8,114220,116670,What the (beep) is going on right now?
33fkmSMgOC8,116670,118580,"Okay, we need to get this going here."
33fkmSMgOC8,118580,121310,"I know absolutely nothing about this,"
33fkmSMgOC8,121310,122810,other than that it's a dev kit
33fkmSMgOC8,122810,125560,and dev kits are a thing.
33fkmSMgOC8,125560,128739,I can't believe it has a 10 gig network port.
33fkmSMgOC8,128740,130399,Why is it labeled debug?
33fkmSMgOC8,130399,132390,I guess if they wanted to know
33fkmSMgOC8,132390,134849,what the actual hardware capabilities are
33fkmSMgOC8,134849,136959,"when downloading files at like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,136960,139190,future network speeds or something like that.
33fkmSMgOC8,139190,140800,Based on the history of this device
33fkmSMgOC8,140800,142000,"that we got from our seller,"
33fkmSMgOC8,142000,143740,we're pretty sure that aside from them
33fkmSMgOC8,143740,144730,"and our logistics team,"
33fkmSMgOC8,144730,146500,"who had to inventory this bad boy,"
33fkmSMgOC8,146500,149310,we're the first ones to really unpack everything
33fkmSMgOC8,149310,150709,and power this thing on.
33fkmSMgOC8,150710,152270,A small studio went under
33fkmSMgOC8,152270,155060,and a few of these special development kits
33fkmSMgOC8,155060,156910,ended up sitting in a warehouse somewhere.
33fkmSMgOC8,156910,159100,"They got access, picked one up,"
33fkmSMgOC8,159100,161950,posted it to Reddit and the rest is history.
33fkmSMgOC8,161950,164020,We ended up paying somewhere in the neighborhood
33fkmSMgOC8,164020,166850,"of around 2,000 US dollars."
33fkmSMgOC8,166850,167990,"Thank you very much seller,"
33fkmSMgOC8,167990,171140,who posted a price and then turned it into a bidding war.
33fkmSMgOC8,171140,172230,"We're very happy we have it,"
33fkmSMgOC8,172230,174010,because opportunities to get your hands
33fkmSMgOC8,174010,177002,on a Codename Scarlet development kit
33fkmSMgOC8,177002,179459,are not going to come around very often.
33fkmSMgOC8,179460,181190,"I mean, outside of developers,"
33fkmSMgOC8,181190,183720,nobody should ever see this.
33fkmSMgOC8,183720,186240,"And yet, here we are."
33fkmSMgOC8,186240,189860,These are features that most people really wouldn't need.
33fkmSMgOC8,189860,191650,Don't give them too much information.
33fkmSMgOC8,191650,193099,"I mean, last thing you want"
33fkmSMgOC8,193100,194870,"is the exact details leaking,"
33fkmSMgOC8,194870,197060,and I (beep) guarantee you
33fkmSMgOC8,197060,198230,that part of the legal agreement
33fkmSMgOC8,198230,199659,you have to sign to get one of these
33fkmSMgOC8,199660,201490,says you do not open it up.
33fkmSMgOC8,201490,203990,Stack up to five XDKs vertically.
33fkmSMgOC8,203990,206920,"Yeah, for them, that would be a pretty big deal, I guess."
33fkmSMgOC8,206920,208920,"You know, you gotta pack in your play testers."
33fkmSMgOC8,208920,210970,Why else would I need to stack Xboxes?
33fkmSMgOC8,210970,213131,"Come on, tell me. Sit, come, come, come, come."
33fkmSMgOC8,213131,213963,- That's pretty much it.
33fkmSMgOC8,213964,216440,One QA person might have something like
33fkmSMgOC8,216440,218970,"four Xbox, four kits at their desk,"
33fkmSMgOC8,218970,221060,and they're gonna stack them to save space.
33fkmSMgOC8,221060,221950,"And then on top of that,"
33fkmSMgOC8,221950,224290,you're gonna have racks that are running automation
33fkmSMgOC8,224290,225500,and stuff like that. - Oh!
33fkmSMgOC8,225500,228050,"- And usually, you can get away with having each one"
33fkmSMgOC8,228050,229140,on an individual rack.
33fkmSMgOC8,229140,230050,That's the ideal.
33fkmSMgOC8,230050,231900,"But sometimes, you stack them up a little bit."
33fkmSMgOC8,231900,232829,- And it's something like this?
33fkmSMgOC8,232830,233810,- Lots of stuff.
33fkmSMgOC8,233810,235482,"I put it all in the script, but..."
33fkmSMgOC8,235482,237709,(people laugh)
33fkmSMgOC8,237710,239537,- Plausible deniability right here.
33fkmSMgOC8,239537,241220,"""I don't actually know what the buttons do."""
33fkmSMgOC8,241220,242053,- I know what the buttons-
33fkmSMgOC8,242053,243749,"- ""But here's my concept of what-"""
33fkmSMgOC8,243749,245250,- They can be programmed. They can be programmed.
33fkmSMgOC8,245250,246490,So they can do whatever you want.
33fkmSMgOC8,246490,248865,You would show something like animation states.
33fkmSMgOC8,248865,250840,Nav mesh that's on the ground
33fkmSMgOC8,250840,251787,"so that you can see like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,251787,253090,"""Oh, there's a level here."""
33fkmSMgOC8,253090,254590,- There's a hole that they can fall through
33fkmSMgOC8,254590,255425,or something.
33fkmSMgOC8,255425,256258,"- There's a hole they can fall through,"
33fkmSMgOC8,256258,257091,"or ""Why are the enemies moving around?"""
33fkmSMgOC8,257091,258700,"""Oh, there's no nav mesh."" - Oh, so cool."
33fkmSMgOC8,258700,259949,- So you can turn on nav mesh.
33fkmSMgOC8,259949,261780,- Cheat buttons!
33fkmSMgOC8,261780,262613,- Kind of.
33fkmSMgOC8,262613,264507,"These are probably more like, ""Turn on FPS,"
33fkmSMgOC8,264507,267020,"""turn on GEO, turn on..."""
33fkmSMgOC8,267020,268069,"Like, stuff like that, yeah."
33fkmSMgOC8,268070,269630,"So you want like, a quick store button,"
33fkmSMgOC8,269630,270920,you can be like press the number five
33fkmSMgOC8,270920,272010,and it'll take you to the store.
33fkmSMgOC8,272010,273938,"It's whatever the programmers wanna do, right?"
33fkmSMgOC8,273938,276250,And then give the tools to QA
33fkmSMgOC8,276250,278410,so that they can QA faster.
33fkmSMgOC8,278410,279840,"- Programmable OLED display,"
33fkmSMgOC8,279840,280910,"and I can see right here,"
33fkmSMgOC8,280910,283990,it's showing SSD speed and FPS.
33fkmSMgOC8,283990,285910,Especially now that we know
33fkmSMgOC8,285910,288530,that Xbox is more of an ecosystem
33fkmSMgOC8,288530,290270,"and less of an individual device,"
33fkmSMgOC8,290270,293160,and they intend for games to run on multiple tiers
33fkmSMgOC8,293160,293993,"of the hardware,"
33fkmSMgOC8,293993,297190,"like, if I wanted to upsell better Xboxes,"
33fkmSMgOC8,297190,299850,"enable fricking FPS counters, you buttheads."
33fkmSMgOC8,299850,301960,Why do I have to explain why this is a good idea?
33fkmSMgOC8,301960,303880,"Front facing USB 3.1 gen one,"
33fkmSMgOC8,303880,307370,so you can just connect all the controllers with a wire.
33fkmSMgOC8,307370,310990,"So Microsoft knows it's convenient, they just don't care."
33fkmSMgOC8,310990,312150,What that tells you
33fkmSMgOC8,312150,316110,is that the SOC has this functionality.
33fkmSMgOC8,316110,317400,It is definitely in there.
33fkmSMgOC8,317400,321419,They did not re-spin it and remove USB C from it.
33fkmSMgOC8,321420,323760,So it's got a total of six USB ports.
33fkmSMgOC8,323760,327120,"Four type A, two Type C, and Microsoft removed them."
33fkmSMgOC8,327120,330870,It has a higher speed development SSD.
33fkmSMgOC8,330870,333169,"It's like, it's some of the coolest stuff,"
33fkmSMgOC8,333170,335110,"whether you're Sony or you're Microsoft or whatever,"
33fkmSMgOC8,335110,336770,"it's some of the coolest stuff they make,"
33fkmSMgOC8,336770,339530,because it's the cutting edge.
33fkmSMgOC8,339530,341880,Look at this giant foot. - I know.
33fkmSMgOC8,341880,344081,"- That's not a foot, that's a whole fricking..."
33fkmSMgOC8,344081,344914,"- Can you see the clarence,"
33fkmSMgOC8,344914,346390,so you can stack them no problem.
33fkmSMgOC8,346390,347940,"Like, all this fan here"
33fkmSMgOC8,347940,349550,and all the vents around the side?
33fkmSMgOC8,349550,352870,"We actually had a retail kit like, catch fire at one point,"
33fkmSMgOC8,352870,353703,'cause it was stacked.
33fkmSMgOC8,353703,356240,"'Cause the old Xboxes, they had the vents on the top, right?"
33fkmSMgOC8,356240,357800,"On the one side? - Yeah, yeah."
33fkmSMgOC8,357800,360099,"- Okay, let's talk about unoptimized builds."
33fkmSMgOC8,360100,361960,That would be why it has 40 gigs
33fkmSMgOC8,361960,363600,"of GDDR six memory then, right?"
33fkmSMgOC8,363600,366130,"- Pretty much, but this one's a little out of the ordinary,"
33fkmSMgOC8,366130,368469,"because normally, so for example, a Scorpio,"
33fkmSMgOC8,368469,370229,the dev kit had double the memory.
33fkmSMgOC8,370230,373810,"12 gig kit, and then the Scorpio had 24."
33fkmSMgOC8,373810,374643,So they just doubled it.
33fkmSMgOC8,374643,377210,"With this, a Series X is 16 gigs of RAM,"
33fkmSMgOC8,377210,378043,so they more than doubled it.
33fkmSMgOC8,378043,379000,- More than doubled it.
33fkmSMgOC8,379000,380950,"- Yeah, it went from 32 to 40."
33fkmSMgOC8,380950,383590,So they've added a whole eight extra gigs of RAM.
33fkmSMgOC8,383590,384889,- I'm just gonna open this shell. I'll be good.
33fkmSMgOC8,384890,386860,"- Okay, yeah, just be careful with the thermal pads."
33fkmSMgOC8,386860,387979,"- I'll be good, I'll be a good boy."
33fkmSMgOC8,387980,391130,"- It's not even pads- - Good boy, good boy."
33fkmSMgOC8,391130,393520,"- They do give these to development companies,"
33fkmSMgOC8,393520,395810,"but you can only get like, two of them for free,"
33fkmSMgOC8,395810,396720,or for cheap.
33fkmSMgOC8,396720,397710,"They rent it to you for like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,397710,399090,a hundred bucks or something like that.
33fkmSMgOC8,399090,400440,"Any more kits than that,"
33fkmSMgOC8,400440,403403,and you will usually have to pay a price.
33fkmSMgOC8,404260,406240,I can't speak to how much this one will cost
33fkmSMgOC8,406240,407569,"or what Xbox is doing now,"
33fkmSMgOC8,407570,409550,"but like, for example, when I was at (beep),"
33fkmSMgOC8,409550,412349,"we had a giant stack of boxes of PS4 dev kits,"
33fkmSMgOC8,412350,413183,"and they were like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,413183,414240,"""Yeah, those are like, 2,400 bucks a pop."""
33fkmSMgOC8,414240,416180,So a lot of people are actually using
33fkmSMgOC8,416180,419022,the retail kits for testing a lot of the time
33fkmSMgOC8,419023,422128,because they're so expensive comparatively.
33fkmSMgOC8,422128,422961,- Got it.
33fkmSMgOC8,422961,424540,- And you mostly just need these guys
33fkmSMgOC8,424540,426850,"for like, tool development. - Sure."
33fkmSMgOC8,426850,429100,- Engine development and optimization
33fkmSMgOC8,429100,430700,and stuff that you'd look at
33fkmSMgOC8,430700,432920,"before the game comes out,"
33fkmSMgOC8,432920,435230,"or before the console launches, right?"
33fkmSMgOC8,435230,436530,- You heard it here first.
33fkmSMgOC8,436530,440110,"Ifixit repairability score, very low."
33fkmSMgOC8,440110,441082,Lots of adhesive.
33fkmSMgOC8,442100,443193,Now hold on a second.
33fkmSMgOC8,444030,447700,Let's say I declare myself to be a game development studio.
33fkmSMgOC8,447700,450740,I hired a game developer guy or something.
33fkmSMgOC8,450740,451610,I'm gonna make a game.
33fkmSMgOC8,451610,453349,So what? Microsoft will just send me two of these?
33fkmSMgOC8,453350,456190,- You have to apply and become part of the program.
33fkmSMgOC8,456190,458060,It's called the Game Developer Program
33fkmSMgOC8,458060,459760,"or something like that, part of Microsoft."
33fkmSMgOC8,459760,461810,"- [Linus] Got it, so they have to say ""Yes, we actually..."""
33fkmSMgOC8,461810,463220,"- Yeah, you have to like, pitch them the game,"
33fkmSMgOC8,463220,465373,"and be like ""Okay, here's our game,"
33fkmSMgOC8,465373,467987,"""we wanna make it for Xbox as well,"
33fkmSMgOC8,467987,470570,"""can we please have a development kit or two?"""
33fkmSMgOC8,470570,472379,And they'll typically send it to you.
33fkmSMgOC8,472379,474072,I thought you were just gonna play games on it.
33fkmSMgOC8,474072,475047,(beep)
33fkmSMgOC8,475047,475880,- How long have you worked here?
33fkmSMgOC8,475880,476880,"- It's okay, David."
33fkmSMgOC8,476880,478880,"If it breaks, it's just the plastic part."
33fkmSMgOC8,478880,481020,It's fine. The ports are still there.
33fkmSMgOC8,481020,482099,- Yeah.
33fkmSMgOC8,482100,482933,"Relax, buddy."
33fkmSMgOC8,484400,485233,- Cool.
33fkmSMgOC8,485233,486066,- So that's interesting.
33fkmSMgOC8,486066,489760,"These are very, very not meant to be removed."
33fkmSMgOC8,489760,492110,You can see they're actually melted into place.
33fkmSMgOC8,493143,493976,- [David] Fantastic.
33fkmSMgOC8,493976,495410,"- They don't expect engineers to like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,495410,496520,tear these down or anything.
33fkmSMgOC8,496520,497870,"If there's any kind of like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,497870,500250,"major architecture over haul for it,"
33fkmSMgOC8,500250,501470,then they'll try to figure out
33fkmSMgOC8,501470,504170,how to run their games on the new architecture.
33fkmSMgOC8,504170,505710,"But luckily, they're all pretty much computers now,"
33fkmSMgOC8,505710,506930,so it's a lot easier.
33fkmSMgOC8,506930,510039,"Like, PS3 was notably really a pain in the ass"
33fkmSMgOC8,510040,511350,to develop for.
33fkmSMgOC8,511350,514349,"- All right, we might have to go a little deeper."
33fkmSMgOC8,514349,515182,Oh! Okay.
33fkmSMgOC8,515182,516419,- It's probably more of the same kind of plastic clips.
33fkmSMgOC8,516419,517680,"- Oh, interesting."
33fkmSMgOC8,517680,519050,- [Nicholas] They're really not meant to be taken apart.
33fkmSMgOC8,519050,522200,"- This is one time assembly, ladies and gentlemen."
33fkmSMgOC8,522200,523033,You know what?
33fkmSMgOC8,523033,524950,This is as far as I wanna go
33fkmSMgOC8,524950,526233,"before at least trying to power this thing up,"
33fkmSMgOC8,526233,529240,because I can see that there's some strain
33fkmSMgOC8,529240,530970,"on these front USB ports here,"
33fkmSMgOC8,530970,533000,as I'm trying to tilt this up.
33fkmSMgOC8,533000,534820,And it's very clear that this thing
33fkmSMgOC8,534820,538380,is just melted plastic riveted together.
33fkmSMgOC8,538380,540380,"I was pressing this button right here,"
33fkmSMgOC8,540380,542320,"and just like, ""Oh no, it's not doing anything,"""
33fkmSMgOC8,542320,544570,'cause I thought the PCB was mounted behind it.
33fkmSMgOC8,544570,545890,"But the PCB was actually here,"
33fkmSMgOC8,545890,547360,so I had to press the switch here.
33fkmSMgOC8,547360,548600,"Wait, so ours works!"
33fkmSMgOC8,548600,550149,- So ours should work.
33fkmSMgOC8,550150,552520,"So that's the thing, is basically everything,"
33fkmSMgOC8,552520,553580,it needs internet.
33fkmSMgOC8,553580,555620,"We can play games, theoretically,"
33fkmSMgOC8,555620,556850,we should be able to pop a game in
33fkmSMgOC8,556850,557936,"and it should be like ""Yeah, sure,"
33fkmSMgOC8,557937,560823,"""you can play it, 'cause you're not signed in"""
33fkmSMgOC8,560823,561656,or whatever.
33fkmSMgOC8,561656,563360,"- Whoa, what did you just do? Did you do cheat codes?"
33fkmSMgOC8,563360,564310,- Kind of.
33fkmSMgOC8,564310,566250,"You can do this on a retail Xbox as well,"
33fkmSMgOC8,566250,568760,"but basically, you hit L-B-R-B-L-T-R-T really quick,"
33fkmSMgOC8,568760,570440,and it brings up a developer settings tab.
33fkmSMgOC8,570440,572060,"Normally, what you need to do"
33fkmSMgOC8,572060,573560,"to get more development stuff,"
33fkmSMgOC8,573560,574850,"is that there's an actual like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,574850,578389,Xbox developer XDK app that you go and you install.
33fkmSMgOC8,578390,580220,"It's called like, Dev Kit or something."
33fkmSMgOC8,580220,581990,And you look it up in the Play Store
33fkmSMgOC8,581990,582830,and you install it.
33fkmSMgOC8,582830,584880,"We can't do that for obvious reasons,"
33fkmSMgOC8,584880,586670,"but every Xbox can do this,"
33fkmSMgOC8,586670,590178,"where you just bring up this little extra hidden menu,"
33fkmSMgOC8,590179,592840,and then you can pop it into Developer Mode.
33fkmSMgOC8,592840,593870,Console will restart after that.
33fkmSMgOC8,593870,595700,"But while you're here, you can get a bunch of stuff."
33fkmSMgOC8,595700,597670,"So it tells you what your sandbox ID is,"
33fkmSMgOC8,597670,600470,"it gives you like, a console IP, a tools IP,"
33fkmSMgOC8,600470,602220,"kernel version, OS version, all that (beep)"
33fkmSMgOC8,602220,603339,"that you can see, yeah."
33fkmSMgOC8,603340,605630,The main thing that we use the sandboxes for
33fkmSMgOC8,605630,608120,is for different development environments
33fkmSMgOC8,608120,609390,when you're testing a game.
33fkmSMgOC8,609390,610223,- [Linus] Okay.
33fkmSMgOC8,610223,612030,"- So for example, retail is just retail."
33fkmSMgOC8,612030,614010,"This is if we were in retail sandbox,"
33fkmSMgOC8,614010,616300,we would be pointing to every other kit
33fkmSMgOC8,616300,617420,that's on the market right now.
33fkmSMgOC8,617420,619329,It would be part of Xbox Live and all that.
33fkmSMgOC8,619330,621570,"There's normally like, three or four of these, at least,"
33fkmSMgOC8,621570,623140,and everyone's testing different stuff
33fkmSMgOC8,623140,624360,in each environment.
33fkmSMgOC8,624360,626850,"- Right, so it could be in like, very early production,"
33fkmSMgOC8,626850,627683,where you're just testing
33fkmSMgOC8,627683,629380,"""Can we even get this function to work?"""
33fkmSMgOC8,629380,630213,- Yeah.
33fkmSMgOC8,630213,632320,"- Then it's gonna go to bug testing,"
33fkmSMgOC8,632320,634490,"then it might go to optimization,"
33fkmSMgOC8,634490,635529,and that's what you're talking about.
33fkmSMgOC8,635530,636363,"- Kind of, yeah."
33fkmSMgOC8,636363,638600,"So like, all the QAs' probably on like, test,"
33fkmSMgOC8,638600,641819,"and then once you're ready to go to production,"
33fkmSMgOC8,641820,643530,"like before you push out an update,"
33fkmSMgOC8,643530,646650,you test everything on basically what's a copy of retail.
33fkmSMgOC8,646650,647700,- Flip plane calls it pre-prod.
33fkmSMgOC8,647700,650580,"- Sure, yeah, but exactly, that's all it is."
33fkmSMgOC8,650580,652510,Your different staging environment.
33fkmSMgOC8,652510,656170,- It has to be staged in multiple data centers.
33fkmSMgOC8,656170,657610,Microsoft has to pay for that bandwidth.
33fkmSMgOC8,657610,660440,"I mean, we've seen events, like major game launches,"
33fkmSMgOC8,660440,663947,where internet traffic as a whole has gone phwomp.
33fkmSMgOC8,664800,666350,"I mean, Microsoft can't even do it with a Windows update,"
33fkmSMgOC8,666350,668358,and nobody even wants to download those.
33fkmSMgOC8,668358,670620,"(Nicholas laughs) - [David] Boom, roasted."
33fkmSMgOC8,670620,671870,- What it's usually looking for
33fkmSMgOC8,671870,673320,is when you've got it not connected
33fkmSMgOC8,673320,675200,"to a white listed network,"
33fkmSMgOC8,675200,676980,and we would have ports at our desks
33fkmSMgOC8,676980,679630,"that are like, this is the port you connect everything to."
33fkmSMgOC8,679630,680463,- Touch nothing else.
33fkmSMgOC8,680463,682860,"- This is your like, random PC port."
33fkmSMgOC8,682860,684550,"That's for everything else, basically."
33fkmSMgOC8,684550,685383,- Okay.
33fkmSMgOC8,685383,686650,Look at that.
33fkmSMgOC8,686650,689710,Internal storage development SSD
33fkmSMgOC8,689710,692170,clear local Xbox 360 store.
33fkmSMgOC8,692170,693227,Is that a thing on the regular Xbox?
33fkmSMgOC8,693227,696029,"That's like, separate storage for Xbox 360?"
33fkmSMgOC8,696030,698100,- This was all probably standard.
33fkmSMgOC8,698100,700279,"One thing you can get for free,"
33fkmSMgOC8,700280,702850,"and just that's available to the public,"
33fkmSMgOC8,702850,705589,is the regular SDK.
33fkmSMgOC8,705590,708420,But that only lets you make PC games
33fkmSMgOC8,708420,710000,or for PC Game Pass.
33fkmSMgOC8,710000,712680,It doesn't let you do any actual Xbox stuff.
33fkmSMgOC8,712680,714360,That's all under NDA.
33fkmSMgOC8,714360,716490,"- [Linus] I'm not gonna check the network, don't you worry."
33fkmSMgOC8,716490,717970,"- It probably wouldn't do anything here,"
33fkmSMgOC8,717970,719439,"but yeah, if we're plugged in,"
33fkmSMgOC8,719440,721497,"I'm sure it would be like ""No, this is not recognized"
33fkmSMgOC8,721497,723260,"""as a white listed account"" or whatever."
33fkmSMgOC8,723260,724375,- Okay.
33fkmSMgOC8,724375,725208,"- So throw on ""Mass Effect."""
33fkmSMgOC8,725208,726041,"- ""Mass Effect."""
33fkmSMgOC8,726041,726874,"- Oh, something went wrong."
33fkmSMgOC8,726874,728100,"- Whoa, hold on a second."
33fkmSMgOC8,728100,730889,"- [Nicholas] These error codes are probably in like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,730890,732770,on Microsoft's website.
33fkmSMgOC8,732770,734000,- Insert first disc.
33fkmSMgOC8,734000,735613,"- Oh, okay. Oh, this is fine then."
33fkmSMgOC8,735613,736880,- This is the eject...
33fkmSMgOC8,736880,737713,How do I eject?
33fkmSMgOC8,737713,739050,- The little button on the side there.
33fkmSMgOC8,739050,740100,"- I was trying to figure out,"
33fkmSMgOC8,740100,743277,"Oh, could we use the 10 gig to speed up this download?"
33fkmSMgOC8,743277,745027,"- Oh yeah, it's a disc."
33fkmSMgOC8,745027,745920,"- Right, we're going off a disc."
33fkmSMgOC8,745920,748820,"Okay, I'll just be patient."
33fkmSMgOC8,748820,751070,"- Please God, don't plug in the frigging 10 gig."
33fkmSMgOC8,751070,753200,- I'm having so much fun right now.
33fkmSMgOC8,753200,755800,"- [Nicholas] So they're on 35, 42."
33fkmSMgOC8,755800,757440,"So this is pretty old, comparatively."
33fkmSMgOC8,757440,761880,- This probably showed up in that developer's studio
33fkmSMgOC8,761880,763800,"in like, early 2020, late 2019."
33fkmSMgOC8,763800,764633,"- Possibly, yeah."
33fkmSMgOC8,764633,767620,"Oh, a date, December 12, 2019."
33fkmSMgOC8,767620,769089,- That's the last time it synced.
33fkmSMgOC8,769090,771163,"Those who know, know."
33fkmSMgOC8,773640,774600,"Oh, right."
33fkmSMgOC8,774600,776420,"It's fine, we're not connected to anything."
33fkmSMgOC8,776420,777917,"I keep freaking out,"
33fkmSMgOC8,777917,780640,"""Okay, if we don't enter the password, it's fine."""
33fkmSMgOC8,780640,782410,"It's irrational, it's totally irrational."
33fkmSMgOC8,782410,783629,This thing has no way of talking
33fkmSMgOC8,783630,784743,to a Microsoft server.
33fkmSMgOC8,785660,786493,That we know.
33fkmSMgOC8,787446,788579,"You know, when's the last time you sat down"
33fkmSMgOC8,788580,789670,in front of a computer
33fkmSMgOC8,789670,791255,that didn't have an internet connection.
33fkmSMgOC8,791255,792169,- Oh yeah.
33fkmSMgOC8,792169,793002,"- And you were like, let me use this computer,"
33fkmSMgOC8,793002,796100,and you realize you can do absolutely nothing
33fkmSMgOC8,796100,798209,on a modern computer without an internet connection.
33fkmSMgOC8,798210,799043,- Unless you're lucky
33fkmSMgOC8,799043,800430,and you've got Steam already launched
33fkmSMgOC8,800430,802044,"and you click ""go offline"" or whatever."
33fkmSMgOC8,802044,803180,"- Yeah, like you can play some solitaire."
33fkmSMgOC8,803180,804013,"- Yeah, pretty much."
33fkmSMgOC8,804013,804846,"They don't even have ""Space Cadet"" anymore."
33fkmSMgOC8,804846,806080,- Open up notepad.
33fkmSMgOC8,806080,807457,"- And be like, ""Here's my cool Xbox"
33fkmSMgOC8,807457,810230,"""I can't use for anything."""
33fkmSMgOC8,810230,813610,"People come over, you say ""Hey, you wanna see my dev kit?"""
33fkmSMgOC8,813610,814790,You bring it to the room
33fkmSMgOC8,814790,816209,"and you're like ""There's the dev kit."""
33fkmSMgOC8,816210,817760,"- Well look, maybe if I was still single,"
33fkmSMgOC8,817760,819590,and I really needed to impress the chicks...
33fkmSMgOC8,819590,821422,"- Sure, yeah, that's the ticket."
33fkmSMgOC8,821422,822255,"- ""Guess what I've got."""
33fkmSMgOC8,822255,823930,"- Yeah, ""You wanna see my Project Scarlet?"""
33fkmSMgOC8,823930,826040,"- Outside of a game development studio,"
33fkmSMgOC8,826040,828920,I believe we will be the first to game
33fkmSMgOC8,828920,829753,on a development kit.
33fkmSMgOC8,829753,832779,"- The PS1 dev kits were like, SGI machines."
33fkmSMgOC8,832780,835560,"Like, you would make the game not even on a computer,"
33fkmSMgOC8,835560,838060,"it was like on a work station,"
33fkmSMgOC8,838060,840460,and then import it to the Playstation.
33fkmSMgOC8,840460,841540,- Making sure people know that...
33fkmSMgOC8,841540,843060,- That stuff costs 10s of thousands.
33fkmSMgOC8,843060,846540,"Even the old consoles, like, Xbox gives these away kind of"
33fkmSMgOC8,846540,847373,"to dev kits, right?"
33fkmSMgOC8,847373,848630,Or to developers.
33fkmSMgOC8,848630,851250,"But even as far back as like, PS3s,"
33fkmSMgOC8,851250,854030,"like I said, they were like $2,500 per kit."
33fkmSMgOC8,854030,857310,And if you're (beep) with 60 dudes downstairs
33fkmSMgOC8,857310,859890,"playing just (beep) and (beep) the whole day,"
33fkmSMgOC8,859890,862787,"that's 60 Xboxes, you know."
33fkmSMgOC8,862787,863620,"- Right, that adds up pretty fast."
33fkmSMgOC8,863620,864900,- That's a lot of money.
33fkmSMgOC8,864900,866750,I've seen everyone set up stuff wrong.
33fkmSMgOC8,866750,868890,- 'Cause then you just don't even have the hassle
33fkmSMgOC8,868890,870153,"of like, ""Oh, I accidentally plugged it in"
33fkmSMgOC8,870153,873035,"""to the wrong port, and fricking worked it."
33fkmSMgOC8,873035,874501,"""Great."""
33fkmSMgOC8,874501,875480,- Yeah.
33fkmSMgOC8,875480,877576,- He's not seen anything. This is just speculation.
33fkmSMgOC8,877577,878562,"- Yeah, I haven't seen anything."
33fkmSMgOC8,878562,879395,- Allegedly.
33fkmSMgOC8,879395,881350,- I'd never do anything wrong at a game development studio.
33fkmSMgOC8,881350,883089,Everything goes perfectly smoothly.
33fkmSMgOC8,883090,885870,"- Yeah, we're trying to keep your butt covered, okay?"
33fkmSMgOC8,885870,888020,And we're trying to keep the rest of him covered.
33fkmSMgOC8,888020,889630,We've got the stealth hoodie from LTT store.
33fkmSMgOC8,889630,891961,"We've got the dad hat, we've got matching hats today."
33fkmSMgOC8,891961,893330,- [Both] Eeeh.
33fkmSMgOC8,893330,894250,- Go check out LTT store.
33fkmSMgOC8,894250,895880,"We've got lots of new colors of water bottles,"
33fkmSMgOC8,895880,896830,they're fricking amazing.
33fkmSMgOC8,896830,898760,"And I believe party shirts are back in stock,"
33fkmSMgOC8,898760,900830,unless they're gone by the time this video goes up.
33fkmSMgOC8,900830,902640,"You know what, I'll let you do the honors"
33fkmSMgOC8,902640,905014,of playing on a dev kit for the first time.
33fkmSMgOC8,905014,906910,"No, I'm joking."
33fkmSMgOC8,906910,909100,He's not even excited about it.
33fkmSMgOC8,909100,910433,I wanna game on it.
33fkmSMgOC8,911830,912700,- Okay.
33fkmSMgOC8,912700,914690,- Plouffe is back from Willow Video.
33fkmSMgOC8,914690,915580,Shout out Willow Video.
33fkmSMgOC8,915580,916690,Those guys are awesome.
33fkmSMgOC8,916690,919270,"And the first one I'm gonna try is ""DIRT 5."""
33fkmSMgOC8,919270,921270,All of these are either launch titles
33fkmSMgOC8,921270,924600,or they're Xbox 360 titles with backwards...
33fkmSMgOC8,924600,925433,- Compatibility.
33fkmSMgOC8,925433,926740,"- That's the same error, isn't it?"
33fkmSMgOC8,926740,928250,- This one is a different error code
33fkmSMgOC8,928250,929090,"than what I got before,"
33fkmSMgOC8,929090,931030,"but it's a lot of like, incompatibility"
33fkmSMgOC8,931030,933100,or it may be due to a network or service issue.
33fkmSMgOC8,933100,935029,- How much money did I just waste on Xbox games?
33fkmSMgOC8,935029,936000,"- Like, a hundred bucks. - Oh!"
33fkmSMgOC8,936000,936833,- It's not that bad.
33fkmSMgOC8,936833,937666,"- What do you mean, it's not that bad?"
33fkmSMgOC8,937666,938499,A hundred bucks is a hundred bucks.
33fkmSMgOC8,938499,940890,"Okay, here, can I have a hundred bucks?"
33fkmSMgOC8,940890,943327,"- I mean, I don't have cash on me."
33fkmSMgOC8,943327,944580,You want me to e-transfer you a hundred dollars?
33fkmSMgOC8,944580,946010,- Excuses.
33fkmSMgOC8,946010,947700,- So there's one thing that we can try.
33fkmSMgOC8,947700,948533,- Oh.
33fkmSMgOC8,948533,950240,- This is kind of a wrench in the plans.
33fkmSMgOC8,950240,952600,There is an offline- - A good wrench?
33fkmSMgOC8,952600,954550,- Maybe. There's an offline system update.
33fkmSMgOC8,954550,956110,"Hold on, there's specific instructions"
33fkmSMgOC8,956110,957070,on how to do this.
33fkmSMgOC8,957070,957903,- [Linus] Full shutdown.
33fkmSMgOC8,957903,958820,"- [Nicholas] Yeah, full shutdown."
33fkmSMgOC8,958820,961240,- Is this something you know from your development days?
33fkmSMgOC8,961240,963010,"Or like, is this just crazy... ?"
33fkmSMgOC8,963010,964230,"- No, I just started Googling"
33fkmSMgOC8,964230,966000,"if you could do an offline system update,"
33fkmSMgOC8,966000,967310,"and like, turns out you can."
33fkmSMgOC8,967310,968600,I don't expect this to work.
33fkmSMgOC8,968600,970779,"- Yeah, right, because this isn't even the same hardware."
33fkmSMgOC8,970780,973270,"- Yeah, so, but we might as well give it a shot."
33fkmSMgOC8,973270,975660,Wait 30 seconds and then plug the main leads back in.
33fkmSMgOC8,975660,978032,"Oh, that's to like, kill the power for sure."
33fkmSMgOC8,978032,979399,- That doesn't mean 30 seconds. 30 seconds is BS.
33fkmSMgOC8,979399,980232,"- No, but..."
33fkmSMgOC8,980232,981065,- If we just try and start it.
33fkmSMgOC8,981065,981898,Let me just try to power it on.
33fkmSMgOC8,981898,983110,"- Yeah, sure, that should like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,983110,984925,cycle any juice that's in there.
33fkmSMgOC8,984926,987250,"You got it? - Yeah, go for it."
33fkmSMgOC8,987250,988850,- Press and hold the Pair button
33fkmSMgOC8,988850,990709,located on the left side of the console.
33fkmSMgOC8,990710,992270,Is there even a Pair button?
33fkmSMgOC8,992270,993520,"Yeah, that looks like the Pair button."
33fkmSMgOC8,993520,996920,And the Eject button located on the front of the console.
33fkmSMgOC8,996920,998660,"- Well, the locations are not gonna help me, sir."
33fkmSMgOC8,998660,999493,- I know.
33fkmSMgOC8,999493,1001740,"- This is a different console. Sir, sir."
33fkmSMgOC8,1001740,1005058,"- I meant press the Xbox button on the console, so then..."
33fkmSMgOC8,1005058,1007420,So you've got those? - Yeah.
33fkmSMgOC8,1007420,1008688,- Okay. - Okay.
33fkmSMgOC8,1008689,1011850,- Continue holding Pair and Eject for 10 to 15.
33fkmSMgOC8,1011850,1012910,"It made a different noise this time,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1012910,1013870,so I think it's doing it.
33fkmSMgOC8,1013870,1014703,- Probably doesn't need anymore-
33fkmSMgOC8,1014703,1016087,"Oh, hi. - Troubleshoot, cool."
33fkmSMgOC8,1016087,1017100,- [David] Oh buddy.
33fkmSMgOC8,1017100,1018389,- So. - Oh!
33fkmSMgOC8,1018390,1019223,"- [Nicholas] Oh, there it goes."
33fkmSMgOC8,1019223,1021190,"- [Linus] Oh, only the D-Pad works. That's interesting."
33fkmSMgOC8,1021190,1023260,"- [Nicholas] It's probably just like, a really low,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1023260,1024510,like a safe mode kind of thing.
33fkmSMgOC8,1024510,1026880,"- [Linus] Whoa, no, (indistinct), shut..."
33fkmSMgOC8,1026880,1027713,"Okay, wait."
33fkmSMgOC8,1027713,1028860,- [Nicholas] Downloading from the...
33fkmSMgOC8,1028860,1030886,"Nothing's plugged in, nothing's hooked up."
33fkmSMgOC8,1030886,1033240,"- Okay, but what I was actually freaking out about"
33fkmSMgOC8,1033240,1034246,"was I thought it was like,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1034246,1035870,"""Yes, this will work."""
33fkmSMgOC8,1035870,1037670,"But if it hasn't downloaded the file,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1037670,1039730,"it can't do a checksum yet, so it might not..."
33fkmSMgOC8,1039730,1040975,It might be thinking...
33fkmSMgOC8,1040975,1044600,Maybe it downloads fricking any file with that extension.
33fkmSMgOC8,1044600,1045600,And then it'll check it after.
33fkmSMgOC8,1045600,1047209,"- Yeah, but it's not connected to any network,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1047209,1050549,"so like, I have no idea if this is going to work or not."
33fkmSMgOC8,1050550,1052520,- We made it 100% of the way through verifying
33fkmSMgOC8,1052520,1054440,without it freaking out and saying no.
33fkmSMgOC8,1054440,1056149,- And it is supposed to restart
33fkmSMgOC8,1056150,1057950,once or twice during the update.
33fkmSMgOC8,1057950,1058783,- I'm starting to...
33fkmSMgOC8,1058783,1059616,"Oh, I'm getting tingles."
33fkmSMgOC8,1059616,1061039,I can't believe you found this.
33fkmSMgOC8,1061040,1062400,"'Cause yeah, they would have to have a way"
33fkmSMgOC8,1062400,1063233,"to update it offline,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1063233,1065450,just in case people don't have internet.
33fkmSMgOC8,1065450,1066283,- [Nicholas] Yeah.
33fkmSMgOC8,1066283,1067309,- Holy crap.
33fkmSMgOC8,1067310,1072310,"If this works, Microsoft is definitely going to make sure"
33fkmSMgOC8,1072550,1075043,that this is fixed for the next one.
33fkmSMgOC8,1075890,1077860,"- Well, these aren't supposed to even get into our hands."
33fkmSMgOC8,1077860,1080660,- Hold on just a gosh darn second here.
33fkmSMgOC8,1080660,1081493,- [Nicholas] Check the firmware.
33fkmSMgOC8,1081493,1084210,"- [Linus] This does not look new. Holy crap, it updated."
33fkmSMgOC8,1084210,1085789,"- [Nicholas] It totally did, yeah."
33fkmSMgOC8,1085790,1086870,- Holy crap.
33fkmSMgOC8,1086870,1088667,- That doesn't guarantee that these are gonna work.
33fkmSMgOC8,1088667,1090590,"- ""Mass Effect,"" here we go, boys."
33fkmSMgOC8,1090590,1092000,- It could still need some kind of-
33fkmSMgOC8,1092000,1092840,- Play disc!
33fkmSMgOC8,1092840,1093820,- I still think it's gonna need
33fkmSMgOC8,1093820,1095190,"some kind of network handshake,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1095190,1097195,and it's gonna say no. - Yeah.
33fkmSMgOC8,1097195,1098778,"- Whoa, ho, ho, ho!"
33fkmSMgOC8,1099970,1102220,"Okay, wait, hold on, hold on. We could still..."
33fkmSMgOC8,1102220,1103610,Shut up.
33fkmSMgOC8,1103610,1106500,We could still try one of the earlier ones.
33fkmSMgOC8,1106500,1107333,- Sure.
33fkmSMgOC8,1108820,1109799,No. - [David] Yeah.
33fkmSMgOC8,1109800,1111462,- No dice. - [David] Damn.
33fkmSMgOC8,1111462,1112388,- You know what?
33fkmSMgOC8,1112388,1115029,We got the 10 gig one is debug.
33fkmSMgOC8,1115030,1115863,- Oh right.
33fkmSMgOC8,1115863,1116696,- And the other one says retail.
33fkmSMgOC8,1116696,1117540,So we should use the one gig port.
33fkmSMgOC8,1117540,1118720,- Network settings.
33fkmSMgOC8,1118720,1120520,"Current network status, wired. Oh."
33fkmSMgOC8,1120520,1121353,- [Linus] Checking service
33fkmSMgOC8,1121353,1122186,- [Nicholas] It's trying to do something.
33fkmSMgOC8,1122186,1123820,- It's trying to do something. It's not working.
33fkmSMgOC8,1123820,1125269,"To be very clear, guys,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1125270,1127600,"this is not gonna like, perform better or anything,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1127600,1128610,it's just...
33fkmSMgOC8,1128610,1131490,"Holy (beep), did ""F1 2019"" just do something?"
33fkmSMgOC8,1131490,1133290,"Does it say ""Ready to start?"""
33fkmSMgOC8,1133290,1134230,- [Nicholas] It's updating.
33fkmSMgOC8,1134230,1135270,- Now hold on a second...
33fkmSMgOC8,1135270,1136417,Something went wrong.
33fkmSMgOC8,1136417,1138530,"""Getting your game ready, this might take a minute or two."""
33fkmSMgOC8,1138530,1141040,"Holy crap, I think this is doing stuff."
33fkmSMgOC8,1141040,1144060,"We are downloading ""F1 2019"" 61 megabits per second,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1144060,1146440,"ladies and gentlemen. - Oh, there it is!"
33fkmSMgOC8,1146440,1147731,"- No, it's banned!"
33fkmSMgOC8,1147731,1148669,"- ""Console is banned from the Xbox network."""
33fkmSMgOC8,1148670,1150120,- It's banned! - There it is.
33fkmSMgOC8,1150120,1152960,"- We got the splash screen for ""Mass Effect"" to come up,"
33fkmSMgOC8,1152960,1154856,and then it instantly went to ban.
33fkmSMgOC8,1154857,1156167,"- ""Who are you?"" - ""Something went wrong."""
33fkmSMgOC8,1156167,1158160,"- ""Give it another try."" Yeah, it's (beep)."
33fkmSMgOC8,1158160,1160483,"We didn't have that tile, it was good."
33fkmSMgOC8,1163130,1164490,- Desk flip.
33fkmSMgOC8,1164490,1166593,- Back to Microsoft it goes. - Yep.
33fkmSMgOC8,1167467,1170080,"- ""There's a problem with your Xbox Live profile."""
33fkmSMgOC8,1170080,1171230,- [David] Yeah.
33fkmSMgOC8,1171230,1172330,"- Oh yeah, that's definitely it."
33fkmSMgOC8,1172330,1173472,"- Yeah, it's borked."
33fkmSMgOC8,1175200,1176276,- [David] Nice.
33fkmSMgOC8,1176276,1177166,- Okay.
33fkmSMgOC8,1177166,1177999,"- [David] $2,000 paperweight, let's go."
33fkmSMgOC8,1177999,1178913,- Eeh.
33fkmSMgOC8,1180600,1182622,- Well that's okay. - We tried everything.
33fkmSMgOC8,1182623,1184460,- And you know what else is okay?
