8yCyDw1WtbA,56640,62640,is when it all kicked off yeah 2018. so  we're going to look at the first four  years and what i've got for you i've got  loads of bits of video
8yCyDw1WtbA,62640,67840,various fights that i've picked out okay  pictures from your social media  we're going to go off on loads of
8yCyDw1WtbA,67840,74080,different tangents not just fighting  because i want to find out more about  you rather than last album that i want  to find out about izzy who the guys all
8yCyDw1WtbA,74080,79520,right we'll see  now listen obviously you had a wonderful  career even before you got to the ufc
8yCyDw1WtbA,79520,85360,and i know that you had big dreams of  being here  let's roll the first one because this is  the debut
8yCyDw1WtbA,85360,90479,yes coming out i remember this is uh  usc221 in perth australia now this guy
8yCyDw1WtbA,90479,96479,looks like an incredibly confident guy  straight away straight off the bat  but this is a moment of realization
8yCyDw1WtbA,96479,102479,you've dreamt of this since you were a  kid was there any nerds at all a little  bit but you see i just cleared my space
8yCyDw1WtbA,102479,108079,piss on the cage and step into my arena  as the as the new dog in the yard would
8yCyDw1WtbA,108079,113680,damn strapping young lad  fighting my my boy now rob wilkinson
8yCyDw1WtbA,113680,120719,and i'll let him know don't get off my  feet you peasant  big left kick  boss
8yCyDw1WtbA,120719,126960,boom and me and he takes me down  and i was just like now this guy doesn't  give up this was like his fourth fifth
8yCyDw1WtbA,126960,134080,attempt trying to take me down  and yeah what are the emotions like on a  debut like this oh relax i have no
8yCyDw1WtbA,134080,139280,emotion  even even for example  when you hear buffer reading them out
8yCyDw1WtbA,139280,145680,for the first time or anything yeah no  emotion i'm just focused in the moment  i'm not even trying to like
8yCyDw1WtbA,145680,151200,damn it's crazy watching this i haven't  watched this fight so long  i've watched it before back in the day
8yCyDw1WtbA,151200,156400,many times does it feel four years ago  miss my face
8yCyDw1WtbA,156400,162160,and i him to the body right here boom oh  and this is the beginning of the end  this is where i realize he's done
8yCyDw1WtbA,162160,168560,something you find you find something  i realized it was done here so i was  like don't rush just take my time
8yCyDw1WtbA,168560,175360,and i take my time find my shots he  spits blood at me here i'm like what the  
8yCyDw1WtbA,175360,180959,so i use that to kind of like  like a faint almost the fact that he  spat blood on me i use that to distract
8yCyDw1WtbA,180959,186000,him  i don't think he meant to  but you know when you're on your period
8yCyDw1WtbA,186000,192319,you got to do what you have to do  i find it amazing you remember every  single shot here i watch this fight a
8yCyDw1WtbA,192319,198879,lot but it's been years since i've  watched this fight so  yeah but it's ingrained in my memory
8yCyDw1WtbA,198879,205200,so everything i remember and the hands  coming here  boom boom find the shot to the body
8yCyDw1WtbA,205200,210560,and sit down  i'm kind of like oh man i could do  better i know i could do better but
8yCyDw1WtbA,210560,216640,what's the emotion like that  just yeah  that's what i did like yeah i knew i
8yCyDw1WtbA,216640,223040,could do better so i was kind of like  now this bit is the iconic bit obviously  the debut everybody remembers the fight
8yCyDw1WtbA,223040,230319,but these are the iconic moments like  you said when you walked into the cage  though  you cleared your space as you said right
8yCyDw1WtbA,230319,236720,and then the  post-fire interview which we're going to  see now  i'm petty i'm like michael jordan in a
8yCyDw1WtbA,236720,241640,sense where i remember everything so i'm  very
8yCyDw1WtbA,248159,254239,yeah  was that premeditated no  even giving off the word that you walked
8yCyDw1WtbA,254239,262240,in because you you did that's what you  did you urinated all over the cage man  that's really just step into a character  whenever i get into a fight i i like to
8yCyDw1WtbA,262240,268560,embody a character that kind of maybe  speaks to the story that i'm telling  myself because everything is a story
8yCyDw1WtbA,268560,274080,we're telling ourselves everything in  life is a story we're telling ourselves  so yeah like i said i was a new dog in
8yCyDw1WtbA,274080,279120,the yard so i just i stepped in the cage  and i was like yo  i'll clean my space and once i clean my
8yCyDw1WtbA,279120,284400,space  yeah i just did what i did so yeah from  the new new dog in the yard to the big
8yCyDw1WtbA,284400,290080,dog in the yard now  with that then with fighting are you  saying that it's always an out-of-body
8yCyDw1WtbA,290080,295600,experience for you whilst you're  yeah you're going through the motions no  it's not like i'm i'm lucid at what's
8yCyDw1WtbA,295600,301919,happening i'm in my i'm in my zone i'm  in myself but at the same time  it's a weird like
8yCyDw1WtbA,301919,307600,third person  video game you play  yeah  what's up the next one let's have a look
8yCyDw1WtbA,307600,313520,at this man  what we got lying now  oh johnny
8yCyDw1WtbA,313520,318960,stone costume by god now  obviously this is the open workout and
8yCyDw1WtbA,318960,324000,you're going through the rocks moves  right this is what this is what we're  doing here now talk to me about your  relationship with wwe because you've
8yCyDw1WtbA,324000,330639,just talked then about an out-of-body  experience when you're performing  how much does this have an influence on
8yCyDw1WtbA,330639,335680,who you are now as an athlete um i mean  watching hours you know sunday night
8yCyDw1WtbA,335680,340960,smackdown monday night raw um  seeing the way the guys like the rock
8yCyDw1WtbA,340960,348160,stone cold  booker t all the shawn michaels  countless names the hardy boys the way
8yCyDw1WtbA,348160,354960,they they just  handled themselves as as performers  definitely influenced myself in the
8yCyDw1WtbA,354960,360080,sense that  advocacy  funny thing is in houston i actually saw
8yCyDw1WtbA,360080,365680,him and i was like is that book of jesus  yeah so  yeah but um yeah they i mean being able
8yCyDw1WtbA,365680,370960,to claim your space and just be an  entertainer and on the stage on the mic  on the moment
8yCyDw1WtbA,370960,376000,um that's something i learned along the  way but definitely the attitude error
8yCyDw1WtbA,376000,383360,helped me  and learning how to claim my own  my own i guess my own time yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,383360,389280,the theater it's it it's a theatric  performance that's what it is yes people  just see it as you're just having a

8yCyDw1WtbA,461199,467199,and this is the bit i rocked him boom  and that that like i remember just  thinking like okay
8yCyDw1WtbA,467199,473039,no rush  he you know he's a spider he'll set  traps for you but just because you  rocked him doesn't mean he's done yet
8yCyDw1WtbA,473039,479360,yeah  there's a moment in this which you'll  see  you actually back off because you can  see a trap i know
8yCyDw1WtbA,479360,486000,i know i can't remember what round it is  but there's there's a mom remember and i  was like i know your tricks like i've  studied this guy for so long that i just

8yCyDw1WtbA,499199,506160,how mentally taxing is a fight like this  against someone like him  it seems like you're constantly thinking  trying to out-think each other yes chess
8yCyDw1WtbA,506160,513039,moves  and this is a cool move by him i love  that that was like most people would  have gone by there but i i
8yCyDw1WtbA,513039,518320,you know i could see it coming there's  several occasions like that  in this fight where he's trying to spin
8yCyDw1WtbA,518320,523950,his bit right here is like an iconic  moment  most people got caught by that
8yCyDw1WtbA,523950,530000,[Applause]  that's movie type for michael  jackson at the end i like that
8yCyDw1WtbA,530000,535519,you know things you know like i said i'm  performing i'm creating moments i'm  creating heart in there so that right
8yCyDw1WtbA,535519,541839,there is an iconic moment that that's  what i was doing  and he just didn't even like he just
8yCyDw1WtbA,541839,547279,knew where his  he just knew where he was gonna be so he  didn't even have his hands up it's crazy
8yCyDw1WtbA,547279,552959,he got me there and then off we drive  again boom oh and then i saw three  silvers there and then he knew i was
8yCyDw1WtbA,552959,558480,hurt  he knew i was hurt and then he was  trying to finish the fight and i was
8yCyDw1WtbA,558480,565839,like okay just maintain your distance  do not get finished by the spider so i  just made sure until i get my wits about
8yCyDw1WtbA,565839,571600,me  how enjoyable was this one beautiful i  had fun in this fight man i really had
8yCyDw1WtbA,571600,576880,fun in this fight and he just showed off  and then this right here he was hurt but
8yCyDw1WtbA,576880,582640,i wish i had gone instead of watch  i was just watching and he goes do it
8yCyDw1WtbA,582640,590000,again and you watch me i'm like no  i'm like  boom yeah i knew this is all i get out
8yCyDw1WtbA,590000,598560,of that eject right yeah i made sure i  was like i've seen this move before you  would never get me spider-man
8yCyDw1WtbA,598560,603920,boom ooh  what's he like as a guy because you  spent the whole week with him obviously  building the fire hit some pieces but
8yCyDw1WtbA,603920,610560,he's cool  he's cool i like the spider man i mean  this is a guy  i revered i still do i still think he's
8yCyDw1WtbA,610560,615920,one of the best ever  in sports not just combat sports and  sports
8yCyDw1WtbA,615920,621040,so for me to be able to play against  them it's kind of like when a i played  against jordan
8yCyDw1WtbA,621040,626800,that bro that takes a lot of people's  heads off but you but the way that you  saw it in sweden we're different man
8yCyDw1WtbA,626800,632640,we're different here i pulled the kick  at the end here  i could have thrown it but i pulled the  kick
8yCyDw1WtbA,632640,638079,listen to the bell  yeah i pulled it i was like ah
8yCyDw1WtbA,638079,644880,that's my guy told me to do this now i  mean this is just  big love yeah i was like hey i love you
8yCyDw1WtbA,644880,651600,he said i love you too  and then he gave me props and then  passed the the baton as he said to me
8yCyDw1WtbA,651600,656800,how does that make you feel because  you're an emotionally connected guy yeah  to all aspects of this you're in this
8yCyDw1WtbA,656800,662399,right to have an idol like this talk  like this this is iconic man and for me  it's just a moment for life
8yCyDw1WtbA,662399,669040,not just for my career moment for life  where  it's  you know you just yeah you you're
8yCyDw1WtbA,669040,674800,recognized by  your idols and you know now they're your  your peers and even here he was giving
8yCyDw1WtbA,674800,682160,me advice about the game and i was like  yeah don't worry  i'm clued on
8yCyDw1WtbA,682160,688240,has anything on this  journey so far for you  taking your breath away few or
8yCyDw1WtbA,688240,694720,definitely definitely bought i mean  like what like that that's one i never  expected that fight to happen that came
8yCyDw1WtbA,694720,700720,out of nowhere like i said i had this  whole europe trip planned  end of the year because i'd be busy you
8yCyDw1WtbA,700720,707040,know that was my fifth fight  within the space of a year and a day in  the ufc but rounded off to a year five
8yCyDw1WtbA,707040,713760,fights in a year that's crazy  um  so yeah for me i was just like yo i want  to have fun i want to do this and then i
8yCyDw1WtbA,713760,719920,was like ah but you only get one chance  to fight your idols  take the fight of course i was not i'm
8yCyDw1WtbA,719920,725680,don't regret it at all  covered all this  i was like yo i don't regret taking that
8yCyDw1WtbA,725680,731200,fight because that now is in the history  books forever and i never planned on i
8yCyDw1WtbA,731200,736320,thought he'd be retired by the time i  was in the ufc so i never planned on  fighting him so the fact that that fight
8yCyDw1WtbA,736320,741839,materialized i was just like  you have to take it this is for history  yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,741839,746959,you just mentioned something that about  activity as well right  and i just want to give you a few men
8yCyDw1WtbA,746959,753200,mate i want to give you props on that  because  there's so many people obviously that  you get frustrated with as a fan because

8yCyDw1WtbA,758399,765519,every 16 weeks we're seeing you in in  the outskirts  undefeated through middleweight  obviously the step-ups are light-heavy
8yCyDw1WtbA,765519,772000,but activity has been key  over the over the last 48 months yeah 48

8yCyDw1WtbA,1050080,1057200,don't know how we can yeah first place  first platelet and here i thought about  going for a dos or anaconda choke and i
8yCyDw1WtbA,1057200,1062640,was like nah you usually get mad at me  if i it up so go to the back and i  just beat the out of me from here
8yCyDw1WtbA,1062640,1071120,oh oh  i'm glad i made the right decision doing  that here one more one boy there you go
8yCyDw1WtbA,1071520,1077840,put him down release the demon  oh  speaking in tongues mate yeah we just
8yCyDw1WtbA,1077840,1083039,knew i've got a million questions here  like this moment now right what is  obviously forget that you're probably
8yCyDw1WtbA,1083039,1089200,not even thinking about it it was just a  relief well we looked at each other  exactly you look you look at you just  shared 25 minutes
8yCyDw1WtbA,1089200,1094720,like we literally were just like bro  like it's not it's like what's the word
8yCyDw1WtbA,1094720,1101280,say less it's like  what's understood doesn't need to be  said yeah we both just knew we both just
8yCyDw1WtbA,1101280,1108000,knew it's a telepathic thing between  each other yeah just that like we spoke  that body language of violence so we're
8yCyDw1WtbA,1108000,1115120,just like  like man and you just give each other  props and we just know like we
8yCyDw1WtbA,1115120,1120559,you share something in there you just  can't you can't explain to anyone else  so what's understood didn't need to be
8yCyDw1WtbA,1120559,1127120,said what's it like have you seen him  since yeah i saw him at the email awards  i think the the following year or that
8yCyDw1WtbA,1127120,1132320,yeah  i know that year that year yeah in the  middle of the year and um
8yCyDw1WtbA,1132320,1138000,do you still do that with each other do  you still like giving each other the  look  knowing what you should when we see each  other we will well i haven't seen them
8yCyDw1WtbA,1138000,1143520,since but when we see each other we just  it's just that like  yeah you know  yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,1143520,1150080,yeah  just on before the start of that fifth  round because we brushed over you told  us what you said
8yCyDw1WtbA,1150080,1156559,talk to us about the mentality in that  particular moment because that's it's a  strong piece of language that isn't it  for anybody that is not a fighter and an
8yCyDw1WtbA,1156559,1162799,artist like yourself to say i'm prepared  to die in that particular moment well i  mean if i'm prepared to die for beard to
8yCyDw1WtbA,1162799,1169520,kill  that's the thing you don't realize but i  really meant that in that moment i  signed my life away i was like yo this
8yCyDw1WtbA,1169520,1174960,is it um  if this is how i die what a glorious  death
8yCyDw1WtbA,1174960,1181360,what a way to go out  in front of the whole world  you know in a crazy battle
8yCyDw1WtbA,1181360,1187200,and i had some negative self-talk in the  middle of that fight that i overcame i  remember like my my head was kind of
8yCyDw1WtbA,1187200,1193280,like you know oh you've  you've done enough you know you you've  hit him with a spinning back elbow
8yCyDw1WtbA,1193280,1198320,you've dropped them  it's okay you can kind of just relax now  and i remember when that
8yCyDw1WtbA,1198320,1203440,that voice was coming all i said i  remember this  verbatim i was like shut up i'm busy
8yCyDw1WtbA,1203440,1209919,that's what i said to myself literally  in my head i was like shut up i'm busy  so i went to work
8yCyDw1WtbA,1209919,1216159,and in that fifth round i was like  you're not going to beat me  i'm prepared to die  i remember looking at him and i said
8yCyDw1WtbA,1216159,1222159,that phrasing yoruba that i've said in  you know all the fights aya vehicle like  the heart of a lion
8yCyDw1WtbA,1222159,1227360,and then  let's fight and then herb dean said and  then we went at it and
8yCyDw1WtbA,1227360,1233600,was a herbino it wasn't my god that i  can't remember but yeah mark was in that  fight  yeah then we were at it and it was just
8yCyDw1WtbA,1233600,1239200,yeah  just history man history in the making  and that's one of those fights that's  like
8yCyDw1WtbA,1239200,1245520,do you think you need a moment like that  to confirm that that's what you do
8yCyDw1WtbA,1245520,1252320,for yourself yeah as a person yes for me  that's one of the greatest moments in my  life because i didn't realize i had
8yCyDw1WtbA,1252320,1257760,that level in me i thought i knew where  the level was or the limit was for  myself but then that fifth round took me
8yCyDw1WtbA,1257760,1263200,to a place where i've never been before  and i was just like man  where's this
8yCyDw1WtbA,1263200,1268480,energy coming from yeah were you happy  with that energy were you scared of the  nah i never scared i'm scared i'm in
8yCyDw1WtbA,1268480,1274640,there but it's a it's an unbelievable  realization in that moment isn't it  because you can talk it and you can  think it but then you now you're living
8yCyDw1WtbA,1274640,1280559,it you're here eugene always said he's  like i always  it's it's good to know because eugene  even as a coach he was like you know
8yCyDw1WtbA,1280559,1287919,it's good to know your fighter has that  in them because you know you have the  inkling that all they do they know how  to dig deep you know you have times in
8yCyDw1WtbA,1287919,1293520,training when you're tired that you push  through and break through that wall  but then when you do it in a fight like
8yCyDw1WtbA,1293520,1299120,that then you know like that guy's got  the fighting spirit  bushido or whatever you call it like
8yCyDw1WtbA,1299120,1306320,yeah  so for him it was good to see and for me  it was good to feel because then i got  to realize that about myself like yo
8yCyDw1WtbA,1306320,1311440,no matter what happens in life i know i  know who i am and i know how deep i can  go
8yCyDw1WtbA,1311440,1316880,to really get that that that resolve you  know how how has that moment changed you
8yCyDw1WtbA,1316880,1322799,not just necessarily as a father  yeah i just know i know my i know
8yCyDw1WtbA,1322799,1328320,but i know what i'm willing to go  through to get what i want in life yeah  like i know what i'm willing to go

8yCyDw1WtbA,1451440,1457120,about it so how do you think you'll be  in the moment i'll just be in my zone i  think it's whoever i'm fighting is dead
8yCyDw1WtbA,1457120,1463279,i'm not even lying like there's  something different about fighting in  front of your people that  the energy they give you the spirit they
8yCyDw1WtbA,1463279,1470400,give you something about us the way we  fight we're just very  it's being around a london man like

8yCyDw1WtbA,1671050,1674150,[Music]
8yCyDw1WtbA,1678480,1684320,has there ever been a moment  not necessarily a fight but a moment an  event where you've slightly been
8yCyDw1WtbA,1684320,1689520,intimidated by it or not  by the moment for example there's  fifteen thousand people in the stadium
8yCyDw1WtbA,1689520,1695039,more than me that's why i came out  dancing because no one else would be  doing what i'm doing and everyone else  would be worried he was worried about
8yCyDw1WtbA,1695039,1700640,the fight i was just like man this is  going to look sick  i literally fell asleep watching my
8yCyDw1WtbA,1700640,1706320,rehearsals  on my phone and i fell asleep with my  phone in my hand watching the rehearsals  like
8yCyDw1WtbA,1706320,1712159,this is going to be tight that's how i  fell asleep  at the end there we were talking over it
8yCyDw1WtbA,1712159,1718720,obviously family members then yeah after  all my parents were like me and the  gaston fight after i won the bill i  honored you because without him my
8yCyDw1WtbA,1718720,1724720,career wouldn't be and that's what i  said on the mic  so um yeah i mean when i won the
8yCyDw1WtbA,1724720,1731360,oh i defended my  belt for the first time my first title  defense  i had to honor my parents because
8yCyDw1WtbA,1731360,1737600,without them i wouldn't be i wouldn't be  here and even though  you know they weren't really on board at
8yCyDw1WtbA,1737600,1742880,first with what i wanted to do with this  game they supported me regardless  because they knew what i wanted to do
8yCyDw1WtbA,1742880,1748799,and they just you know it's what you do  for the people you love you support them  so  yeah i had to honor them as well
8yCyDw1WtbA,1748799,1755360,it must  listen  as a parent myself to see your child go  in into combat must be incredibly
8yCyDw1WtbA,1755360,1761200,difficult for them i'm sure you've had  some proper conversations down the years  definitely i mean for nigerian parents
8yCyDw1WtbA,1761200,1766720,that's not um  i mean someone from my part of the world  never did that yeah ufc and i'm going to
8yCyDw1WtbA,1766720,1772880,be a champion i'm going to do this  talking about like  what  so yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,1772880,1777919,um  yeah i just i just knew what i wanted to  do and i just like you know when you
8yCyDw1WtbA,1777919,1783679,have your own vision and you you know  who you are you just kind of like you  just have to stick to it
8yCyDw1WtbA,1783679,1790000,it's incredible love from them though to  because they watch it obviously they're  there they're watching yeah the boy yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,1790000,1796799,walk to battle  okay you don't take too many licks to be  fair so maybe it's a little bit easier  for him to to watch it man but still
8yCyDw1WtbA,1796799,1802720,there's still the threat of it you know  and that must be incredible that must  bring on some serious anxiety for him  when when they're watching you do that
8yCyDw1WtbA,1802720,1808480,uh my mom ever she's very comfortable  now she just knows who her son is she  knows she gave birth to a legend so
8yCyDw1WtbA,1808480,1814640,yeah now she's uh  yeah she watches the fights like even  when i'm not fighting any ufc card they

8yCyDw1WtbA,1987919,1994880,yeah we're enjoying ourselves we're just  we're we're making our own history we  have stories we'll we'll tell forever
8yCyDw1WtbA,1994880,2001200,not even from last night in london my  first night out in london i'm like i got  some stories i can tell yeah but not on  camera okay yeah we'll do that off
8yCyDw1WtbA,2001200,2007360,camera  the second part of this picture is  obviously that i wanted to talk about is
8yCyDw1WtbA,2007360,2013120,the car right oh yeah  yeah  are we growing up we all got hopes and
8yCyDw1WtbA,2013120,2018640,dreams of various things whole wheels  yeah right we all want to achieve  certain things but of course there's
8yCyDw1WtbA,2018640,2024640,always going to be materialistic things  that we we connect to stuff okay yes yes  talk to me about your fascination with
8yCyDw1WtbA,2024640,2030880,cars um what's like i said hot wheels  you know i used to play hot wheels as a  kid you always just have these ideas of
8yCyDw1WtbA,2030880,2036799,like i want to get a cool sports car so  i wanted to let i wanted a lamborghini  aventador matte black
8yCyDw1WtbA,2036799,2042399,that looked like the batmobile yeah  unfortunately um i couldn't sit up  straight in it so
8yCyDw1WtbA,2042399,2048158,that'd be big man yeah i know people  forget yeah but um yeah i sat in one in  the same thing i couldn't i could have
8yCyDw1WtbA,2048158,2055599,set up straightness so  yeah the mclaren spoke to me the color  itself  um reminded me of um
8yCyDw1WtbA,2055599,2062240,very very and it reminded me of um  from the naruto series and it's a 720s
8yCyDw1WtbA,2062240,2068000,in the naruto series there's 720  episodes so  that was just
8yCyDw1WtbA,2068000,2073118,you know what story are we telling  ourselves so it just made sense to me  like this is this car is the beast that
8yCyDw1WtbA,2073118,2079280,chose me so it became my tail beast and  yeah i dubbed the kuruma after the  nintendo fox
8yCyDw1WtbA,2079280,2084800,this is your batmobile yeah but this is  this is yours back home i'm fascinated  as well
8yCyDw1WtbA,2084800,2089919,you use  vehicles like this as kind of a further  expression of your fight week because i
8yCyDw1WtbA,2089919,2095358,know that you when you is fight week you  have a different car in order to whip a  rug yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2095358,2100839,i like to conceptualize things i mean  this time i had um this fight what i  have a color nine
8yCyDw1WtbA,2100839,2106880,rolls-royce i just wanted to see what  that felt like even people were like why  are you driving are you supposed to get  driven i'm like well i don't like to get
8yCyDw1WtbA,2106880,2114079,driven i'm self-driven  so i was driving around in the colorado  myself and  yeah it was good fun i enjoyed it what's
8yCyDw1WtbA,2114079,2120880,the thought behind it is it because it's  part of the performance  having that throughout the course of the  week that's just me expression it's all
8yCyDw1WtbA,2120880,2127440,expression this is art like the way you  live is art so for me it was all about  expression yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2127599,2133040,now this is big yeah  it was  well it is come on let's be honest i  don't think there's been a combat artist
8yCyDw1WtbA,2133040,2138240,to win something like this since 1950s  right yeah  like something like that yeah it was big
8yCyDw1WtbA,2138240,2143599,for new zealand so to to to be named the  it would be nice if they recognize us as
8yCyDw1WtbA,2143599,2149680,um you know equals  you know according to other sports as  well yeah that would be nice i get that
8yCyDw1WtbA,2149680,2155440,but okay we'll talk about that in a  minute but this particular accolade  where you were classed as the premier
8yCyDw1WtbA,2155440,2162240,sports person in new zealand i honestly  think it's just a pr stunt like i mean  yeah it is bigger one no but they tried
8yCyDw1WtbA,2162240,2168320,to  i think they had it the next year or  last year or something and i think i was  just like why i never tried to say like
8yCyDw1WtbA,2168320,2173839,athlete of the decade  and i was like i wasn't going to go to  that show anyway because i felt like
8yCyDw1WtbA,2173839,2179440,nuggets are about this show so they when  they put me on there people watch so i  felt like they they nominated me just to
8yCyDw1WtbA,2179440,2185040,kind of get eyes on it and they were  going to give it to someone else so i  was being set up i felt it so i wasn't  going to go anyway
8yCyDw1WtbA,2185040,2190560,um because i'm not stupid  so yeah um  yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2190560,2197200,i'm not local i'm global i know i know  what these guys do you know like  i i know the game put it that way i know
8yCyDw1WtbA,2197200,2204000,the game and respect it and thanks for  the award i don't know  i didn't get no money from it but yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2204000,2211119,it was nice i think it's a  it's a doorstop somewhere in the gym now  man you want to kill a suit though yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2211119,2216640,as the guy said the mustard collard suit  yeah and i let him know it's me with the  mustard color suit
8yCyDw1WtbA,2216640,2223838,according to his muscle colored face  right i think we got some more fights
8yCyDw1WtbA,2226240,2232320,i was on this fight man but the  experience of doing it without fans i  loved it yeah i loved it i liked it it
8yCyDw1WtbA,2232320,2237760,was quiet  simple oh my god sometimes i watch  myself i'm like who the is this guy
8yCyDw1WtbA,2237760,2243200,like is this really  yellow habibi yeah  you see this is interesting for us as
8yCyDw1WtbA,2243200,2250720,fans because we can hear you we can hear  corner we can hear him  it's a mad experience normally it's just  fans and screaming yeah so so intimate i
8yCyDw1WtbA,2250720,2257680,felt i love the sound of  the bones and one thing i love is that  slow boom it's slow i said that to him
8yCyDw1WtbA,2257680,2264160,right there  because he was yeah  i had him dead to rights body kick ooh
8yCyDw1WtbA,2264160,2271838,that hurt  he was trying to just like all this food  and i knew i was like you're hurt i know  you're hurt
8yCyDw1WtbA,2273920,2279440,just checking and probing him getting  the the reads was this one personal yes  very
8yCyDw1WtbA,2279440,2286480,i wanted to take this guy out badly and  i made sure i did  he had no he he just did not even know
8yCyDw1WtbA,2286480,2292000,what was coming i just i i was in my  zone and i had him dead to rights
8yCyDw1WtbA,2292160,2299200,shift whoop whoop  touch touch touch  go  southpaw a little question mark level
8yCyDw1WtbA,2299200,2306720,one  and then jab boom oh  i was just in my zone here here i was in  my zone i just knew i had him
8yCyDw1WtbA,2309839,2315440,pop pop pop pop  and here was the quickest slip i've ever
8yCyDw1WtbA,2315440,2320319,done in my life  boom oh
8yCyDw1WtbA,2321200,2327560,i love that screen i love that screen  because it's so quiet here's corner  screaming for panic
8yCyDw1WtbA,2327980,2335200,[Laughter]  another iconic moment another one yes
8yCyDw1WtbA,2335200,2341920,and another one here yeah just me having  fun dancing i just knew are you a little  bit upset that that wasn't in front of
8yCyDw1WtbA,2341920,2348240,fans just because of the magnitude  i liked it you kind of like preferred it  that way on the private island fighting
8yCyDw1WtbA,2348240,2355200,in front of some bajillion years and  yeah kicking ass  kai carlos my boys you know i mean it's
8yCyDw1WtbA,2355200,2360880,a family affair it's a team affair which  i was just gonna ask you that about this  team this team is we're the best taking
8yCyDw1WtbA,2360880,2366240,over the world man yeah we are now we're  the best i love what we're doing we're  um we're in it right now
8yCyDw1WtbA,2366240,2371839,so it's hard to kind of um i guess  like you said sometimes you can't see  the forest for the trees but i make sure
8yCyDw1WtbA,2371839,2377359,i just remove myself once in a while i'm  just like i haven't sometimes like  that fight camp because we were
8yCyDw1WtbA,2377359,2383280,quarantined in the gym  for that for because it was quarantined  so yeah in the gym for that fight camp
8yCyDw1WtbA,2383280,2388560,same thing we try to do  for dance fight you know  late last year and they were like oh you
8yCyDw1WtbA,2388560,2395359,can't do that again and we're like why  no we changed the the wording of the  so you're moving the goal post but then
8yCyDw1WtbA,2395359,2402240,you're letting the  you know all blacks and the netball  teams have their own quarantine  facilities to train but you won't let us
8yCyDw1WtbA,2402240,2407920,so that that's the kind of you know  i was just like oh well we're on top of  the world which we still are doing well
8yCyDw1WtbA,2407920,2414160,you want to like try coattails and write  out coattails with that when they had a  chance to try and shaft us they did so i
8yCyDw1WtbA,2414160,2420079,was like  so yeah that's why  i'm dark on the um the establishment in
8yCyDw1WtbA,2420079,2425280,new zealand when it comes to the way  they treated us compared to other sports  one thing that i like about what i saw
8yCyDw1WtbA,2425280,2431599,the dancing or the whole team together  it's it's a genuine love and we saw i  know that i don't have the pictures for  this but i saw obviously your emotional
8yCyDw1WtbA,2431599,2436960,reaction to blood diamond getting this  opportunity in the ufc yeah we obviously
8yCyDw1WtbA,2436960,2442319,consume through your youtube channel you  watching for example kai's fight against  their coded guard brand just the way
8yCyDw1WtbA,2442319,2447440,that you are absolutely 100 invested in  not just your own career yeah but the
8yCyDw1WtbA,2447440,2453599,career of your friends as well 100 i  mean this is rising ties lifts all ships  i didn't do this by myself
8yCyDw1WtbA,2453599,2459280,i'm in there by myself you know um but  yeah it's a team effort so they help me
8yCyDw1WtbA,2459280,2464880,get ready for my fights as much as i  help them get ready for their fights and  yeah we lift each other up like rising
8yCyDw1WtbA,2464880,2470480,tides um next up we i think we've got  the step up to light heavy yeah yes okay
8yCyDw1WtbA,2470480,2476720,we're chopping some pizza at the  weigh-ins yeah look at me just a skinny  boy doing his own thing yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2476720,2483200,just quickly on this whilst this tip  rolls obviously we could see the tattoos  there  taught me through the ink because
8yCyDw1WtbA,2483200,2490000,yeah  my tattoos they just make sense to me  later on like people you know oh what  does it mean i'm like i don't first of
8yCyDw1WtbA,2490000,2496640,all i look sick  that's why i got it it's a cool image  but then later on  the the meaning or the significance of
8yCyDw1WtbA,2496640,2502720,the tattoo reveals itself so then i'm  like oh that's why i really wanted that  tattooed on me that's why i really
8yCyDw1WtbA,2502720,2507760,wanted that imprinted on my body yeah  i know that there will be a plan later
8yCyDw1WtbA,2507760,2514079,in the career to do this again this side  mission of course definitely was there  ever a temptation to
8yCyDw1WtbA,2514079,2520160,actually blow up your weight properly in  order to go up here yeah because i feel  like i'll be slower i'll be it'll be  silly for me
8yCyDw1WtbA,2520160,2526720,like i did all right in this fight i  could do better i know i can  yeah even this guy i could beat this guy
8yCyDw1WtbA,2526720,2531359,i know i can he even he gave me my  respect after the fight
8yCyDw1WtbA,2533839,2540480,how'd you look at it now  a good land yeah oh yeah good good  learning experience i'm not attached to
8yCyDw1WtbA,2540480,2546079,these like the outcomes that's why i  heard him and he takes me down here  because he knew i heard him
8yCyDw1WtbA,2546079,2552640,and he was like oh oh okay i gotta  take him down now do you think too many  fighters are connected to the role yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2552640,2558960,they're too worried about the outcome  they're too worried about the outcome  well yeah i heard him drift before that
8yCyDw1WtbA,2558960,2564400,and then he realized look i need to take  this guy down i think it takes me down  somewhere around here well there's
8yCyDw1WtbA,2564400,2570880,there's an abs there's an obvious shift  from jan's tactics after the second  round yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2571359,2578079,the apex too yeah i was having fun in  there i still was having fun even though  i didn't get the results i wanted i mean
8yCyDw1WtbA,2578079,2585520,this is what they keep saying even he  said on the legendary polish power i was  going to get knocked out in this fight
8yCyDw1WtbA,2585839,2592720,i feel the legendary polish power  i just felt the legendary polish weight  which was really good he shifted that
8yCyDw1WtbA,2592720,2598960,very well  and he he played the right moves to keep  me where i needed to be to not win that
8yCyDw1WtbA,2598960,2604560,fight  when do you think you will make  that move  properly
8yCyDw1WtbA,2604560,2609599,omega well no right now it's just 185  everything's focused on 185 but
8yCyDw1WtbA,2609599,2614800,when it's time i'll know does does 185  concern you that you might run out of
8yCyDw1WtbA,2614800,2620960,people to fight nah  there's always fresh blood yeah it's  always fresh blood there's always fresh
8yCyDw1WtbA,2620960,2624078,blood around um
8yCyDw1WtbA,2628880,2634720,he says at the end of this that he  absolutely needs a rest so therefore not  only was it a physical yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2634720,2640160,yeah i was i was never really hurt i was  never in trouble i was kind of just like  uh
8yCyDw1WtbA,2640160,2645680,so he he put it on in the last 10  seconds but all that wasn't there  throughout the fight he was just like
8yCyDw1WtbA,2645680,2651520,let me just hold on to him and make sure  i i i secure the the ground
8yCyDw1WtbA,2651520,2657680,you know what i mean because i was  waiting for him to push her up and do  some work but  but he he said himself in the aftermath
8yCyDw1WtbA,2657680,2664160,of this that this is probably this is  the most mentally taxing fight that he's  ever been in because he's constantly  thinking what you're what you're doing
8yCyDw1WtbA,2664160,2669040,yeah i'm not an easy fight  never said you were my mother
8yCyDw1WtbA,2669200,2674240,a lot of people think that sometimes i'm  like well we'll find out i'll find out
8yCyDw1WtbA,2674240,2679920,there you go a rest  he's a good guy yeah all right then you  just talked about there'll always be
8yCyDw1WtbA,2679920,2685119,people to fight in the middleweight  division yeah talk to me about this guy  i'm coming for this is a dm he sent me
8yCyDw1WtbA,2685119,2692400,one time i came i i sent him something  uh i can't remember to be honest uh even
8yCyDw1WtbA,2692400,2698560,after his last fight against brunson i  remember i didn't see him online for a  few weeks maybe months and i dm'd him
8yCyDw1WtbA,2698560,2704480,just making sure he was all right  and then that wasn't when he sent me  that that was a while before that but
8yCyDw1WtbA,2704480,2711119,yeah um he's i'm coming for you i'm  coming for you  that's darren man darren's you know
8yCyDw1WtbA,2711119,2716400,daryl's gonna down and i hope he does  well because i would like to fight him  before it's all said and done
8yCyDw1WtbA,2716400,2723520,maybe in wembley that will go  down  yeah that would be what about  liverpool and that's a big old stadium
8yCyDw1WtbA,2723520,2729680,no why not i'd like to go into enemy  territory as you know  that's my it's a thing i do
8yCyDw1WtbA,2729680,2735920,so yeah i wouldn't mind doing that going  to scouser territory  and then yeah
8yCyDw1WtbA,2736000,2741359,jared next yeah joe definitely i want  him next  in
8yCyDw1WtbA,2741359,2747599,i thought i was gonna get it then i  thought i was gonna get some action  what  you listen as i said right at the start
8yCyDw1WtbA,2747599,2753040,of this 48 months  an incredible amount of achievement in  that for you has the time frame
8yCyDw1WtbA,2753040,2758640,surprised you in any way shape or form a  little faster than i thought but no i  knew everything was gonna happen quick
8yCyDw1WtbA,2758640,2763838,for me okay so what's happening in the  next 48 months
8yCyDw1WtbA,2764240,2770560,oh i'm defending my belt a lot of times  and i'm i'm gonna i'm going back to fly  everywhere i'm sure
8yCyDw1WtbA,2770560,2776319,and  we'll find out we'll find out i don't  know i don't look that far ahead  normally that's too far ahead for me to
8yCyDw1WtbA,2776319,2782800,like  plan  so because i know whenever i do that  there's always variables in life so
8yCyDw1WtbA,2782800,2789359,yeah i just peek a peek at the future do  you think we'll ever see you at  heavyweight because you've done it in  another yeah martial i mean me and you
