ES_JBy-LonY,22120,23670,"- [Narrator] A series of events,"
ES_JBy-LonY,23670,25310,called the menstrual cycle
ES_JBy-LonY,25310,27410,happens about once every month
ES_JBy-LonY,27410,30779,to prepare a woman's body for pregnancy.
ES_JBy-LonY,30780,34270,"Changing levels of natural chemicals in the bloodstream,"
ES_JBy-LonY,34270,37860,called hormones control these events.
ES_JBy-LonY,37860,39870,The reproductive organs affected
ES_JBy-LonY,39870,42853,"by these hormones include the vagina,"
ES_JBy-LonY,44750,45793,"cervix,"
ES_JBy-LonY,48750,49763,"uterus,"
ES_JBy-LonY,52410,53853,"fallopian tubes,"
ES_JBy-LonY,55730,57053,and ovaries.
ES_JBy-LonY,58370,61160,The ovaries produce two main hormones
ES_JBy-LonY,61160,64742,called estrogen and progesterone.
ES_JBy-LonY,65630,68657,"As the level of estrogen begins to rise,"
ES_JBy-LonY,68657,71479,it causes the normally thick mucus
ES_JBy-LonY,71480,73963,inside the cervix to thin out.
ES_JBy-LonY,76060,79000,Estrogen also triggers other hormones
ES_JBy-LonY,79000,80570,to cause one of the ovaries
ES_JBy-LonY,80570,82360,to release an egg.
ES_JBy-LonY,82360,85023,This process is called ovulation.
ES_JBy-LonY,86760,89470,"If a woman has sex during this time,"
ES_JBy-LonY,89470,92720,"a man's reproductive cells, called sperm,"
ES_JBy-LonY,92720,94910,can pass through the thinner mucus
ES_JBy-LonY,94910,96483,to fertilize an egg.
ES_JBy-LonY,98580,102460,"In the uterus, estrogen causes the lining to thicken,"
ES_JBy-LonY,102460,105583,which prepares it to receive a fertilized egg.
ES_JBy-LonY,106900,109810,Rising progesterone levels cause glands
ES_JBy-LonY,109810,111810,in the lining to release fluid
ES_JBy-LonY,111810,114052,that feeds the fertilized egg.
ES_JBy-LonY,115430,118520,Progesterone also causes the thinned out mucus
ES_JBy-LonY,118520,121119,"in the cervix to become thick again,"
ES_JBy-LonY,121120,123863,which prevents sperm from passing through.
ES_JBy-LonY,125020,127450,"If an egg hasn't been fertilized,"
ES_JBy-LonY,127450,132450,the levels of both estrogen and progesterone begin to fall.
ES_JBy-LonY,132500,135900,"This drop in hormone levels causes menstruation,"
ES_JBy-LonY,135900,139760,a process where the uterus sheds its inner tissue lining
ES_JBy-LonY,139760,141833,and blood through the vagina.
ES_JBy-LonY,145652,148510,"An intrauterine device, or IUD,"
ES_JBy-LonY,148510,150700,is a birth control method consisting
ES_JBy-LonY,150700,153660,of a soft flexible T-shaped device
ES_JBy-LonY,153660,155623,with a thin string on the end.
ES_JBy-LonY,156750,160040,There are two types of intrauterine devices:
ES_JBy-LonY,160040,164513,hormonal IUDs and a copper IUD.
ES_JBy-LonY,165700,169310,"To prevent pregnancy, a doctors places an IUD"
ES_JBy-LonY,169310,171090,inside a woman's uterus
ES_JBy-LonY,171090,174063,with the string hanging down inside her vagina.
ES_JBy-LonY,175000,178230,Both types of IUD cause mild inflammation
ES_JBy-LonY,178230,179683,"of the uterine lining,"
ES_JBy-LonY,181360,183320,which releases immune cells
ES_JBy-LonY,183320,185523,and chemicals that kill sperm.
ES_JBy-LonY,189670,193240,Hormonal IUDs also contain a synthetic type
ES_JBy-LonY,193240,196343,of progesterone called levonorgestrel.
ES_JBy-LonY,198013,200510,Levonorgestrel mainly prevents pregnancy
ES_JBy-LonY,200510,203299,"by thickening the mucus inside the cervix,"
ES_JBy-LonY,203300,206283,which prevents sperm from entering the uterus.
ES_JBy-LonY,208110,211230,It also prevents the uterine lining from thickening
ES_JBy-LonY,211230,214672,so it is less likely to receive a fertilized egg.
ES_JBy-LonY,219140,222150,"About a month after inserting an IUD,"
ES_JBy-LonY,222150,224069,the doctor may schedule an exam
ES_JBy-LonY,224070,226223,to make sure it is still in place.
ES_JBy-LonY,227580,229730,The doctor may also teach the woman
ES_JBy-LonY,229730,232280,how to check her IUD between visits
ES_JBy-LonY,232280,235313,by feeling for the string inside the vagina.
ES_JBy-LonY,236940,238360,"Depending on the type,"
ES_JBy-LonY,238360,240580,an IUD can be left in place
ES_JBy-LonY,240580,243250,for 3 to 10 years.
ES_JBy-LonY,243250,246000,Women can have their doctor remove an IUD
ES_JBy-LonY,246000,248310,"at any time for any reason,"
ES_JBy-LonY,248310,251183,including the desire to have children.
ES_JBy-LonY,254930,257870,"An intrauterine device, or IUD,"
ES_JBy-LonY,257870,259859,is one of the most effective methods
ES_JBy-LonY,259859,261043,of birth control.
ES_JBy-LonY,262800,265569,IUDs are over 99% effective
ES_JBy-LonY,265570,268120,at preventing pregnancy.
ES_JBy-LonY,268120,271120,This means that less than 1 out of 100 women
ES_JBy-LonY,271120,273020,will become pregnant each year
ES_JBy-LonY,273020,275960,if they use an IUD and check it regularly
ES_JBy-LonY,275960,277673,for correct placement.
ES_JBy-LonY,280360,284530,"However, IUDs are only about 97% effective"
ES_JBy-LonY,284530,287073,if not checked for correct placement.
ES_JBy-LonY,293420,296650,"For more information on any type of birth control,"
ES_JBy-LonY,296650,298173,talk to your doctor.
