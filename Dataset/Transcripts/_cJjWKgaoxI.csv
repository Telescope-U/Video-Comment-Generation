_cJjWKgaoxI,33760,34800,like it
_cJjWKgaoxI,34800,37520,now first up is a very simple but super
_cJjWKgaoxI,37520,39600,effective mod for your gaming mouse if
_cJjWKgaoxI,39600,41200,you're a pc gamer
_cJjWKgaoxI,41200,43600,and that's going to be these brand new
_cJjWKgaoxI,43600,45520,glass skates from pulsar with their
_cJjWKgaoxI,45520,48640,super glide skates and they are insane
_cJjWKgaoxI,48640,50239,like i'm not even being dramatic they
_cJjWKgaoxI,50239,52239,will completely change how you game for
_cJjWKgaoxI,52239,54160,the better so pulsar recently dropped
_cJjWKgaoxI,54160,56000,these super glide feet and their goal is
_cJjWKgaoxI,56000,58320,to pretty much make compatible skates
_cJjWKgaoxI,58320,60879,for every mouse from every major company
_cJjWKgaoxI,60879,62800,out there they already had a phase one
_cJjWKgaoxI,62800,64720,release which covered like razer
_cJjWKgaoxI,64720,67200,logitech their own pulsar mice and stuff
_cJjWKgaoxI,67200,68960,but they're pretty much just gonna make
_cJjWKgaoxI,68960,70960,skates for whatever mouse you have which
_cJjWKgaoxI,70960,73040,is insane to see so the big difference
_cJjWKgaoxI,73040,75360,with these obviously versus other skates
_cJjWKgaoxI,75360,77759,out there is these are made from actual
_cJjWKgaoxI,77759,79680,glass your typical mouse feet are going
_cJjWKgaoxI,79680,82560,to be teflon you see the 100 virgin ptfe
_cJjWKgaoxI,82560,84320,skates out there that are more pure the
_cJjWKgaoxI,84320,86240,difference with these is they just give
_cJjWKgaoxI,86240,89280,you an insanely buttery smooth glide
_cJjWKgaoxI,89280,91600,like if you thought 100 ptfe skates were
_cJjWKgaoxI,91600,93920,smooth picture that times 10 now so like
_cJjWKgaoxI,93920,95040,i said they have a bunch of different
_cJjWKgaoxI,95040,96560,mice that's already compatible with and
_cJjWKgaoxI,96560,97680,what's really cool is they're making
_cJjWKgaoxI,97680,99280,them in different colors and different
_cJjWKgaoxI,99280,101200,designs for the mice as well i'm liking
_cJjWKgaoxI,101200,103119,the little touch like on the razer viper
_cJjWKgaoxI,103119,105360,skates they're green and it has little
_cJjWKgaoxI,105360,107200,fangs on them you know looks wise it
_cJjWKgaoxI,107200,108320,doesn't matter because it's on the
_cJjWKgaoxI,108320,109439,bottom of your mouse you're never going
_cJjWKgaoxI,109439,111200,to see it but it's just that extra touch
_cJjWKgaoxI,111200,113040,it's going that extra mile and i can
_cJjWKgaoxI,113040,114799,definitely appreciate that so the one
_cJjWKgaoxI,114799,116159,trade-off to keep in mind if you do
_cJjWKgaoxI,116159,118079,upgrade to these glass feet is they're
_cJjWKgaoxI,118079,120399,gonna be a lot faster like i said so if
_cJjWKgaoxI,120399,122640,you have like a control pad that's gonna
_cJjWKgaoxI,122640,124240,be the perfect pairing with these
_cJjWKgaoxI,124240,126320,however muscle memory you know it's in
_cJjWKgaoxI,126320,128800,our advantage i use a hybrid mouse pad
_cJjWKgaoxI,128800,131200,and it is just perfect a great mix of
_cJjWKgaoxI,131200,134400,control and speed and i just absolutely
_cJjWKgaoxI,134400,136480,love it they're also a lot quieter i'll
_cJjWKgaoxI,136480,137680,do a sound test you can hear how it
_cJjWKgaoxI,137680,140680,sounds
_cJjWKgaoxI,158800,162080,so quieter smoother faster pulsar is
_cJjWKgaoxI,162080,163920,doing some really great stuff with these
_cJjWKgaoxI,163920,165760,supergly glass skates can't recommend
_cJjWKgaoxI,165760,168400,them enough and like i said this is just
_cJjWKgaoxI,168400,170400,phase one if your mouse isn't compatible
_cJjWKgaoxI,170400,171840,yet odds are they're gonna be making it
_cJjWKgaoxI,171840,173680,for you later on down the line and
_cJjWKgaoxI,173680,176160,they're only like 20 to 25 depending on
_cJjWKgaoxI,176160,177920,which mouse you have and next you have
_cJjWKgaoxI,177920,180080,this pretty interesting desktop usb
_cJjWKgaoxI,180080,182800,microphone that also has this built-in
_cJjWKgaoxI,182800,184879,mixer that you can use which is gonna be
_cJjWKgaoxI,184879,187440,absolutely perfect if you're like a live
_cJjWKgaoxI,187440,190319,streamer and stuff this will be clutch
_cJjWKgaoxI,190319,193280,this the fox novo usb mic and this is
_cJjWKgaoxI,193280,195840,the mixer and the great thing about this
_cJjWKgaoxI,195840,197760,is it has tons of different inputs so
_cJjWKgaoxI,197760,199920,what you can do is plug you know the mic
_cJjWKgaoxI,199920,201920,into here your headphones under here
_cJjWKgaoxI,201920,204159,into your pc and then real time on the
_cJjWKgaoxI,204159,206879,mixer itself remix the audio level so
_cJjWKgaoxI,206879,208799,you can you know mix up how you're
_cJjWKgaoxI,208799,210480,hearing it what levels you're hearing
_cJjWKgaoxI,210480,212000,the map it's just going to make it so
_cJjWKgaoxI,212000,213200,much more convenient while you're
_cJjWKgaoxI,213200,215360,streaming and built-in there's different
_cJjWKgaoxI,215360,217680,effects and different you know sound
_cJjWKgaoxI,217680,218799,effects and stuff not only for your
_cJjWKgaoxI,218799,221200,voice but just sound effects in general
_cJjWKgaoxI,221200,224959,weird things like clapping sure why not
_cJjWKgaoxI,224959,226879,laughing effects
_cJjWKgaoxI,226879,229440,kissing i don't know weird things like
_cJjWKgaoxI,229440,231680,that built in and as you can hear this
_cJjWKgaoxI,231680,233280,is the sound quality which i think is
_cJjWKgaoxI,233280,235360,pretty damn good now there's also some
_cJjWKgaoxI,235360,237200,things like i said you can do with your
_cJjWKgaoxI,237200,239439,voice so for example this is just the
_cJjWKgaoxI,239439,241280,origin setting you know the origin of
_cJjWKgaoxI,241280,242879,your voice
_cJjWKgaoxI,242879,245439,if i want to do this sound effect
_cJjWKgaoxI,245439,247840,i could kind of creepy
_cJjWKgaoxI,247840,249840,speaking of creepy now you have the
_cJjWKgaoxI,249840,253360,monster sound effect credit card you got
_cJjWKgaoxI,253360,255599,it just changing it up on the fly
_cJjWKgaoxI,255599,257199,different like reverberation if you want
_cJjWKgaoxI,257199,260160,to have like that singing pop effect
_cJjWKgaoxI,260160,261600,kind of the same thing different
_cJjWKgaoxI,261600,264240,reverberation here but yes some pretty
_cJjWKgaoxI,264240,266320,cool stuff also if you want to get real
_cJjWKgaoxI,266320,268000,crazy with it you want to channel your
_cJjWKgaoxI,268000,270320,entert pain you can do
_cJjWKgaoxI,270320,272320,things like add some auto-tune to your
_cJjWKgaoxI,272320,274639,voice all in real time
_cJjWKgaoxI,274639,277759,baby girl what's your name i want to buy
_cJjWKgaoxI,277759,279680,you a drink
_cJjWKgaoxI,279680,282560,how about some like 07 kanye
_cJjWKgaoxI,282560,285600,somewhere far along this road he lost
_cJjWKgaoxI,285600,286960,his soul
_cJjWKgaoxI,286960,290080,to a woman so heartless
_cJjWKgaoxI,290080,292240,let's put it back on this setting now
_cJjWKgaoxI,292240,294080,yes so you get the idea again if you're
_cJjWKgaoxI,294080,296080,a streamer and you want that on the fly
_cJjWKgaoxI,296080,298720,just adjustment with that mixer you can
_cJjWKgaoxI,298720,301280,do so pretty damn cool i think and the
_cJjWKgaoxI,301280,304000,one caveat about this is when i bought
_cJjWKgaoxI,304000,305919,it it was fifty dollars i checked the
_cJjWKgaoxI,305919,308000,price history chart it's been fifty
_cJjWKgaoxI,308000,310240,dollars until february 1st when they
_cJjWKgaoxI,310240,312720,jacked it up to 69.99
_cJjWKgaoxI,312720,315120,as you can hear 450 bucks i think it
_cJjWKgaoxI,315120,316720,sounds pretty good if you're interested
_cJjWKgaoxI,316720,318720,in it i would possibly wait until i drop
_cJjWKgaoxI,318720,320560,it back down to the normal price don't
_cJjWKgaoxI,320560,322320,know why it's jacked up i just checked
_cJjWKgaoxI,322320,323919,before i started filming and was bummed
_cJjWKgaoxI,323919,326160,out as well but i bought it for under 50
_cJjWKgaoxI,326160,328479,and that's what it's been next up we
_cJjWKgaoxI,328479,332320,have these 17 little rgb light sticks i
_cJjWKgaoxI,332320,334080,saw them on tiktok i've seen them
_cJjWKgaoxI,334080,336560,everywhere pretty much and they're voice
_cJjWKgaoxI,336560,338080,activated there's also an app you can go
_cJjWKgaoxI,338080,339919,in and control the effects and stuff but
_cJjWKgaoxI,339919,341440,as you can see they can pulse along to
_cJjWKgaoxI,341440,343360,your gameplay or your music there's a
_cJjWKgaoxI,343360,345440,built-in little a microphone on them as
_cJjWKgaoxI,345440,347840,well so you can do all that give your
_cJjWKgaoxI,347840,350000,desktop a little bit extra flair it
_cJjWKgaoxI,350000,351680,comes with two little stands so you can
_cJjWKgaoxI,351680,353120,you know like i said prop them up if you
_cJjWKgaoxI,353120,354960,want each side of your monitor so if you
_cJjWKgaoxI,354960,356880,have like you know your gameplay going
_cJjWKgaoxI,356880,358560,your music going it can pulse along to
_cJjWKgaoxI,358560,360639,that there's different effects built in
_cJjWKgaoxI,360639,362000,different speeds you can change the
_cJjWKgaoxI,362000,364560,color all that good stuff or just use
_cJjWKgaoxI,364560,366880,the app control it that way and also
_cJjWKgaoxI,366880,368319,they're battery powered you know they're
_cJjWKgaoxI,368319,369280,wireless you don't have to have them
_cJjWKgaoxI,369280,371520,plugged in which is always good so prop
_cJjWKgaoxI,371520,372960,them up there get that little bit of
_cJjWKgaoxI,372960,375120,extra flair going on with the gaming
_cJjWKgaoxI,375120,377199,setup and they're under 20 bucks so not
_cJjWKgaoxI,377199,378960,a bad little pickup next up something
_cJjWKgaoxI,378960,380720,that i bought just for me to use around
_cJjWKgaoxI,380720,383120,the studio and it has been absolutely
_cJjWKgaoxI,383120,384400,clutch and i figured you guys probably
_cJjWKgaoxI,384400,386800,find it useful as well this is a tiny
_cJjWKgaoxI,386800,388319,little label maker and what i've been
_cJjWKgaoxI,388319,390160,using it for is keeping all my keyboard
_cJjWKgaoxI,390160,392880,switches nice and organized it's small
_cJjWKgaoxI,392880,394960,and compact it's wireless as well so i
_cJjWKgaoxI,394960,396319,have to hook this up or anything like
_cJjWKgaoxI,396319,398080,that and go through the whole printing
_cJjWKgaoxI,398080,400160,process it's done in seconds and it's
_cJjWKgaoxI,400160,402400,all configured right on your phone
_cJjWKgaoxI,402400,403680,there's an app where you can go in and
_cJjWKgaoxI,403680,405600,create your own label and they do make
_cJjWKgaoxI,405600,407600,it really really simple you can pretty
_cJjWKgaoxI,407600,409520,much do anything you want you can add
_cJjWKgaoxI,409520,414319,pictures graphics barcodes qr codes text
_cJjWKgaoxI,414319,415759,symbols they have a bunch of stuff
_cJjWKgaoxI,415759,418240,already inside the app different text
_cJjWKgaoxI,418240,419919,settings and font you can configure
_cJjWKgaoxI,419919,422240,pretty much everything save it and then
_cJjWKgaoxI,422240,424560,print it right there for you literally
_cJjWKgaoxI,424560,426560,take seconds like i'll show you real
_cJjWKgaoxI,426560,428560,time you hit print on the app and then
_cJjWKgaoxI,428560,430560,just out of here look at that takes a
_cJjWKgaoxI,430560,432960,second and now you got a brand new label
_cJjWKgaoxI,432960,434319,so maybe you want to organize your
_cJjWKgaoxI,434319,436240,pantry stuff around the office i don't
_cJjWKgaoxI,436240,438160,know like i said for me and my very
_cJjWKgaoxI,438160,440639,particular use as a tech youtuber who
_cJjWKgaoxI,440639,442639,makes keyboard content having all my
_cJjWKgaoxI,442639,444720,switch bins now organized i could say
_cJjWKgaoxI,444720,446720,what the switch is the type of switch
_cJjWKgaoxI,446720,448639,how many i have in there so when i'm you
_cJjWKgaoxI,448639,450240,know going to build my next keyboard i
_cJjWKgaoxI,450240,453199,can see what is in each bin particularly
_cJjWKgaoxI,453199,455120,and that's why i love this thing and
_cJjWKgaoxI,455120,458080,it's only 35 bucks pretty damn good deal
_cJjWKgaoxI,458080,460319,then last but not least is one of the
_cJjWKgaoxI,460319,463520,most popular smart text searches on
_cJjWKgaoxI,463520,466160,amazon in general and that is for a
_cJjWKgaoxI,466160,469120,smart watch and uh i'm actually wearing
_cJjWKgaoxI,469120,472080,one right now this guy pretty damn
_cJjWKgaoxI,472080,473919,useful for the price so what i like
_cJjWKgaoxI,473919,476000,about this smart watch for both ios and
_cJjWKgaoxI,476000,478240,android users is the simplicity when the
_cJjWKgaoxI,478240,480000,screen's not even on i think it looks
_cJjWKgaoxI,480000,482000,nice and simple you can get it in black
_cJjWKgaoxI,482000,484080,like i have or silver it comes with two
_cJjWKgaoxI,484080,486080,different bands with this brown one as
_cJjWKgaoxI,486080,487840,well as a black one and there's a ton of
_cJjWKgaoxI,487840,489199,customization when it comes to the
_cJjWKgaoxI,489199,491280,actual watch faces as well as like
_cJjWKgaoxI,491280,493360,statistics and things that it analyzes
_cJjWKgaoxI,493360,496000,you can go through customize the faces
_cJjWKgaoxI,496000,497680,configure certain ones to have like
_cJjWKgaoxI,497680,499360,pictures and stuff in the background
_cJjWKgaoxI,499360,500720,there's a whole widget section where you
_cJjWKgaoxI,500720,502800,can bring up a bunch of different things
_cJjWKgaoxI,502800,504240,that are all useful things are like you
_cJjWKgaoxI,504240,506319,know logging your exercises checking the
_cJjWKgaoxI,506319,508319,weather checking your notifications on
_cJjWKgaoxI,508319,510319,your phone built-in media controls if
_cJjWKgaoxI,510319,512159,you're listening to spotify you took the
_cJjWKgaoxI,512159,514000,trigger your camera on your phone
_cJjWKgaoxI,514000,515760,there's just a lot of stuff built in
_cJjWKgaoxI,515760,517360,which is really cool it makes it a
_cJjWKgaoxI,517360,519518,really good value so on the watch itself
_cJjWKgaoxI,519518,521760,they have six faces saved but you can go
_cJjWKgaoxI,521760,524320,inside the app and download as many as
_cJjWKgaoxI,524320,526560,you want there are a ton to pick from
_cJjWKgaoxI,526560,528240,probably close to 100 and there's some
_cJjWKgaoxI,528240,529920,really cool ones a lot of simple ones as
_cJjWKgaoxI,529920,532000,well ones that look just like an apple
_cJjWKgaoxI,532000,534560,watch face there's just a bunch in there
_cJjWKgaoxI,534560,536720,so you can pick one that suits you and
_cJjWKgaoxI,536720,538640,your style which i think is really cool
_cJjWKgaoxI,538640,540320,because you're not limited in any way
_cJjWKgaoxI,540320,542240,really there's a bunch to pick from and
_cJjWKgaoxI,542240,543920,also as a smart watch you can do things
_cJjWKgaoxI,543920,545760,like i said before with logging all your
