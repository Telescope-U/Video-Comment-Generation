lKIbT-4UFaE,6080,11840,"Edward Hopper's world was New York and he  understood that city, more than most people.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,12880,18480,"He understood that even though you may live in  one of the most crowded and busy cities on earth,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,18480,26400,it is still possible to feel entirely alone.  This painting was completed on january the 21st 1942. 
lKIbT-4UFaE,26400,33680,Just weeks after the bombing of Pearl  Harbor and America's entry into World War II.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,34560,40480,"That's not to say the war was a direct influence,  but the feeling of dread, many americans had,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,41040,47920,"surely infused the painting. Afraid of air raid  attacks, New York had blackout drills and lights were dimmed"
lKIbT-4UFaE,47920,57839,"in public spaces. Streets emptied out,  and Hopper's city was effectively dark... and silent.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,74480,78640,"[Newsreel] ""The route was past miles of tenements, giving  the passengers a glimpse into every window,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,79200,83280,"all the tenement dwellers got in return, was a  feeling of being close to the passing parade"".  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,84000,90880,Edward Hopper took the elevated El-train to work  for decades. In his forties he was a failure who  
lKIbT-4UFaE,90880,96880,"couldn't sell a painting. He hated his job as  a magazine illustrator, but he needed the money.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,97760,103680,His paintings were pretty much ignored by critics.  while his fellow artists enjoyed success and fame.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,104560,110880,"But hopper was convinced of his talent, and even  when he was broke, he only accepted illustration  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,110880,119680,"work three days a week. Hopper's voice: ""Illustration really didn't  interest me i was forced into it, by an effort  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,119680,127200,"to make some money that's all"". The rest of the  week he painted extraordinary images. "
lKIbT-4UFaE,127200,133360,He spent his entire adult life in New York City. Most of it  in a small walk-up apartment in Greenwich Village.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,134000,140960,Eventually his wife Jo would move in.  It was not a happy marriage they argued a lot and  
lKIbT-4UFaE,140960,148240,"it was explosive, at times violent and extremely  codependent. They would sometimes not talk to each  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,148240,155280,"other for days, and spent much of their marriage in  silence. We see this reflected in the disconnected  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,155280,162319,and unhappy couples he portrays time and again  in his paintings. Couples who may share the same  
lKIbT-4UFaE,162320,171280,"space, but inhabit different worlds. Then in 1924  at the age of 42, he had his first sellout show,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,171840,176720,"promptly gave up his illustration, and  devoted his life exclusively to art."
lKIbT-4UFaE,179680,186560,He married Jo in 1924 the same year he got his  solo show. They were both in their 40s when they  
lKIbT-4UFaE,186560,192800,"married, and they would stay together for 43  years. Before they married Jo was a moderately  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,192800,200320,"successful artist, and it was her who introduced  him to curators at the Brooklyn museum, who bought  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,200320,206960,"one of his paintings and launched his career.  It was down to Jo that Edward became a success,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,208080,215120,"a fact he never thanked her for. Jo Hopper: ""it seems to me   that women are the ones that show the gratitude"".  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,216000,221680,"In fact Edward, a gloomy and silent figure would  spend their marriage constantly belittling and  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,221680,229120,denigrating his wife and her artistic talents.  Jo would respond with verbal assaults of her own.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,230320,235920,She was possessive and jealous and refused  to allow other women to pose for him. 
lKIbT-4UFaE,235920,242160,"She was the model for every single one of his paintings,  including ""Girlie Show"" when she was 60 years old.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,243440,248480,Their unhappy marriage almost certainly  contributed to the artists depicting figures  
lKIbT-4UFaE,248480,254800,"who seem emotionally unresolved. In Hopper's  paintings, couples are not communicating,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,254800,261040,"touching or displaying any affection.  Relationships are ambiguous, characters  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,261040,267840,"do not interact with each other. They are  disconnected, both from themselves, and from us.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,269840,274960,"Jo and Edward Hopper loved the theatre  and movies, and nighthawks suggest to us  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,274960,279840,"a scene on an illuminated stage, as if  we are watching in a darkened theatre.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,280640,286320,"His compositions were often influenced by set  design, stage lighting and the kind of aggressive  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,286320,293680,cropping and angles we see in cinema. With Hopper's  work it is important to focus on the preparation.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,294640,300480,"Finding the right subject matter crippled him  with anxiety. Once he decided, there followed months  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,300480,307280,"of research, preparation, and mostly sketching.  There are 19 surviving sketches for Nighthawks,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,307280,314160,"but he would have done many more. Hopper would use  life drawings to establish a visual understanding,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,314160,320640,and then relied on his subconscious to refine  the final composition of his paintings.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,320640,326400,"We know from Jo's notes on the painting, that she posed  for the woman, and Edward posed for the three men.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,327200,332480,"He dismissed his years spent illustrating  magazines, but along with the preparation skills he  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,332480,338720,"picked up, it also helped to hone his storytelling  abilities. He planned Nighthawks like a film  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,338720,345840,"director. Storyboarding the painting ahead of its  creation, he prepared props, the position of hands,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,345840,351840,"the distance of the couple, the clothes.  And everything was documented by Jo. "
lKIbT-4UFaE,352880,358800,"Then he worked out the angle of the diner's window,  and its position in the street like an architect.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,358800,364720,"Hopper uses strong diagonal lines for the diner,  that converge off-screen and suggest a space  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,364720,371120,outside the painting. But also lead the eye to the  right. No matter which side of the painting you  
lKIbT-4UFaE,371120,377520,"look at first, the clever use of perspective, pulls  your eyes towards the four figures in the diner. "
lKIbT-4UFaE,377520,384240,"He uses colour to achieve this too. Darker tones of  red and green outside the diner, stand out against  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,384240,392000,the bright yellow interior. Causing our gaze to  shift from exterior to interior. There is no life  
lKIbT-4UFaE,392000,399200,"outside the diner and what details there are, are  minimal. We see a cash register across the way, in  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,399200,407360,an otherwise deserted store. We see an ad above the  diner. But the buildings around are devoid of life.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,407360,414080,"This is a world shut down. The large window, not  only creates a barrier between the viewer and  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,414080,421599,"the characters, but also emphasises the silence  inside the diner, and adds a voyeuristic touch.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,421600,428160,"The characters are trapped, like specimens  in a jar. Windows and looking through them,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,428160,435360,feature in so many of Hopper's works. And we are  often looking at an angle. Although he was often  
lKIbT-4UFaE,435360,441120,"grouped with the ""American realist painters"", he  once said: ""I think i am still an impressionist""  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,442160,448240,The ideas of one artist in particular Gustav  Caillebotte was a major influence and is rarely  
lKIbT-4UFaE,448240,454800,"discussed. His works often feature the window  motif, but we can also see his influence on  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,454800,463840,"Hopper's loose brush work, his use of saturated  colour, his urban settings - and his perspectives.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,464720,470800,"Like the Impressionists, Hopper was obsessed by  light. The year before Hopper painted Nighthawks,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,470800,476240,"""Cafe terrace at Nigh""t by Vincent van Gogh  was exhibited in New York, which we know  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,476240,483520,Hopper saw and admired. Both scenes are lit by  artificial light. Gas lamps in van Gogh's case.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,485200,490960,"In hopper's diner, the light source is neon  light, a relatively new thing in the 1940s,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,490960,497520,"which gives it an eerie glow, like a beacon on  the dark street corner. The night-time setting is  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,497520,504240,melancholic and enhances the emotional content  of the work. Suggesting danger or uneasiness.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,505680,512080,"Hopper often portrayed a specific time of day in  his paintings, and night-time seems a particular  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,512080,519241,"time of anxiety for him, from early on in his career.  If you are looking for a door to welcome us in -"
lKIbT-4UFaE,519241,527241,there just isn't one - to go in or out - the diner is  hermetically sealed. Effectively keeping the viewer  
lKIbT-4UFaE,527241,533081,"at bay. We can only stare in from the outside. The door we see, probably leads to the kitchen.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,533881,539641,What really interested Hopper was emotions  and interpersonal relationships. He was drawn  
lKIbT-4UFaE,539641,543161,"to the lives of people, he'd seen  through the windows on the El-train,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,544521,551801,in offices and in restaurants and apartments.  The characters are in their own worlds. As is  
lKIbT-4UFaE,551801,558521,"usual with Hopper, there is no sign of conversa tion  amongst them. Tension somehow radiates from them.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,559161,564441,"He specialised in these open-ended narratives,  which demand the active role of the viewer  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,564441,569961,"in completing the story. He plays with  our expectations, with our unconscious mind."
lKIbT-4UFaE,571732,577402,"This unrelated image, painted two years before  Nighthawks, is a radically different subject matter,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,577812,583577,But there is still a sense of foreboding. A feeling  that the story will continue outside the frame.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,584441,589561,"Couples and their lack of emotional interaction,  was a theme in Hopper's work, and this would  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,589561,597800,"increase as he got older and his relationship with  Jo more distant. The couple are physically close,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,597801,604361,"yet psychologically miles apart. Are they even a  couple? At first we think their hands are touching,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,604361,611641,"but they are not. Her coffee cup is steaming,  his is  stone cold. Perhaps suggesting he has been waiting  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,611641,615971,"a while for her. The title of the painting came from Jo,"
lKIbT-4UFaE,616071,620123, who described this character  as having a hawk beaked nose. 
lKIbT-4UFaE,620289,626449,"He is holding an unlit cigarette, which in  Hopper's original sketch, was in the woman's hand.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,626551,633031,"The isolation of the solitary man with his back  to us, is accentuated by the couple. A closer look  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,633161,639081,"shows us that he is holding a glass with his right  hand, and he has a newspaper folded flat underneath his left."
lKIbT-4UFaE,639667,646776,"The front page, no doubt full of news of  the war. It is unclear who this random glass is for.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,647168,652528,"Maybe it's for us? Along with everyone  else, the waiter is not conversing  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,652730,657610,or even making eye contact with anyone  else. He is just staring out of the window.
lKIbT-4UFaE,660570,666330,"Ever since he painted Nighthawks, people have tried  to work out the exact location of the real diner.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,667003,670443,Following hints the artist  gave in various interviews.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,670534,676614,People spent months trudging around New  York without success. That's because the  
lKIbT-4UFaE,676614,683014,diner never was in New York. It was always in  the same place - inside Edward Hopper's head.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,686645,693469,"Hopper was a fan of Ernest Hemingway's short  story ""The Killers"" from 1927. which is considered  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,693469,700109,"an inspiration for Nighthawks. It tells the story  of two thugs, who enter a diner in search of their  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,700109,707389,"next victim. The classic 1946 movie version,  was in turn inspired by Hopper's Nighthawks.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,709031,717431,"The quintessentially American artist loved cinema,  and cinema, that quintessentially American art form,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,717431,723991,loved Hopper. He often went to the cinema  alone at night in search of inspiration.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,725410,731170,Film-noir was a primary influence and we can  see this in what many consider to be the first  
lKIbT-4UFaE,731170,738050,"film-noir, released one year before he completed  Nighthawks. It is said that while shooting  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,738050,743570,"""Force of Evil"", the director took the cinematographer  to an exhibition of Edward Hopper's works,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,743675,749195,"and said, that he wanted the picture to look  like those paintings. Hopper said that even  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,749195,754395,"his early works, may have been influenced by  German Expressionist cinema he saw in Paris."
lKIbT-4UFaE,756818,763757,"When it comes to the filmmakers themselves, Hopper  is arguably the most influential artist of all time."
lKIbT-4UFaE,763995,770000,"A new generation of filmmakers would pay  homage to Hopper's use of: High contrast lighting,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,770000,776560,"his American settings of anonymous apartments  diners and bars, by his extreme cropping  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,776560,782240,"and decentralized framing. But in particular, they  would be inspired by the characters he painted.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,783058,789458,"Characters, waiting for their stories to  be told. ""Nighthawks"" itself was faithfully  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,789458,794818,recreated for the movies. With the diner  becoming a shortcut to emotional dysfunction.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,796209,802609,"Nighthawks, like the best movie, is not just about  composition and style, it is a masterwork that in  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,802609,808049,"a single frame can suggest to us a narrative,  that stretches far beyond the picture plane."
lKIbT-4UFaE,812866,824866,"Hopper: ""It's probably a reflection of my own - I may  say loneliness - i don't know"". With Nighthawks,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,824866,831426,"Edward Hopper captures a world of loneliness,  isolation and quiet anguish. The painting,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,831426,837346,"an immediate success, was bought by the Art  Institute of Chicago, where it still is today.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,839113,845193,"Hopper, the quiet man of American painting,  projected an ""everyman"" image, but he was  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,845193,851833,"a complicated and troubled man. He was an  intellectual, who struggled to find inspiration,  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,851833,858717,"and grappled with meaning. His works took months  of preparation and hard work, and he only produced  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,858717,865037,about five paintings a year. Sometimes less.  He often felt like an outsider himself.  
lKIbT-4UFaE,866019,873023,"At six foot five, he was an exceptionally tall man,  and by the age of 12 he was already six foot tall.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,873712,879311,A fact that certainly contributed to his  growing sense of isolation and loneliness. 
lKIbT-4UFaE,880502,884662,"Painfully shy, he was a loner from an early age.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,885292,891932,"This continued into adulthood, and he was deeply  introverted and uncomfortable in social situations.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,893059,897552,"When he married Jo, it would seem  that his years of loneliness were over.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,898041,903321,"But as many people discover, you can be in  a relationship, and still be utterly alone.  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,904350,911389,"Hopper's paintings demonstrate to us, that these  feelings are normal. That loneliness or feelings  "
lKIbT-4UFaE,911390,920754,of isolation are commonplace. Ironically his  paintings show us - that actually we are not alone.
