VTEhYwtjTjo,320,4240,this is sunseeker's brand new 65 sport
VTEhYwtjTjo,4240,6080,yacht and it's an intriguing boat the
VTEhYwtjTjo,6080,7839,amount of detailing that has gone into
VTEhYwtjTjo,7839,10880,this is just incredible and it starts
VTEhYwtjTjo,10880,12240,literally as soon as we step onto the
VTEhYwtjTjo,12240,13360,boat because look at the way they've
VTEhYwtjTjo,13360,15120,done these steps here what they've done
VTEhYwtjTjo,15120,17039,in fact is they've used flexi-tek in
VTEhYwtjTjo,17039,19359,order to give this curved and formed
VTEhYwtjTjo,19359,22000,appearance now just to show you
VTEhYwtjTjo,22000,23600,exactly what difference that makes if
VTEhYwtjTjo,23600,24720,you go and have a look at this boat next
VTEhYwtjTjo,24720,26960,door this is how steps normally look
VTEhYwtjTjo,26960,28560,upon to the back of a boat but look at
VTEhYwtjTjo,28560,30240,the difference this makes it's just
VTEhYwtjTjo,30240,31760,fantastic and then the way that they've
VTEhYwtjTjo,31760,33600,mirrored it with this stainless steel
VTEhYwtjTjo,33600,36399,trim around here that looks brilliant
VTEhYwtjTjo,36399,38079,now you can put a jet ski on here it's a
VTEhYwtjTjo,38079,39600,high-low platform but there's also a
VTEhYwtjTjo,39600,41200,garage in here i think i'm going to show
VTEhYwtjTjo,41200,42840,you in there because it is rather
VTEhYwtjTjo,42840,44960,impressive now there's a couple of very
VTEhYwtjTjo,44960,47120,interesting points about this
VTEhYwtjTjo,47120,48800,some neat detailing so for example look
VTEhYwtjTjo,48800,50480,at the shower they built in up here so
VTEhYwtjTjo,50480,52079,you have that so that when you capture
VTEhYwtjTjo,52079,53760,the swimming or whatever it's just like
VTEhYwtjTjo,53760,55120,a rainfall shower right there which is
VTEhYwtjTjo,55120,57600,brilliant but also look at the way
VTEhYwtjTjo,57600,60079,that this is offset it's not in the
VTEhYwtjTjo,60079,61440,center line and the reason for that is
VTEhYwtjTjo,61440,64000,this will take a williams 395 tender
VTEhYwtjTjo,64000,66000,that pulls in in the normal way but it
VTEhYwtjTjo,66000,68080,means you can get up around and next to
VTEhYwtjTjo,68080,69520,it look like this floor is completely
VTEhYwtjTjo,69520,71439,flat also means that if you wanted to
VTEhYwtjTjo,71439,73119,you could rack this out on this side for
VTEhYwtjTjo,73119,75520,dive gear or other bits and pieces so it
VTEhYwtjTjo,75520,78000,just gives you a load more versatility
VTEhYwtjTjo,78000,79680,than the normal situation of having a
VTEhYwtjTjo,79680,81360,rib that goes in and it's absolutely
VTEhYwtjTjo,81360,82799,nailed on both sides and once it's in
VTEhYwtjTjo,82799,84159,you can't get yourself or anything else
VTEhYwtjTjo,84159,86240,in with it this actually makes for a
VTEhYwtjTjo,86240,87759,really versatile area i love the way
VTEhYwtjTjo,87759,89040,they've taken the flex seat all the way
VTEhYwtjTjo,89040,92000,into here as well that's brilliant
VTEhYwtjTjo,92000,94479,anyway let's carry on up lots more to
VTEhYwtjTjo,94479,96000,see
VTEhYwtjTjo,96000,98320,and as we head on up what you'll find up
VTEhYwtjTjo,98320,101119,here is some pad up on the top some nice
VTEhYwtjTjo,101119,102399,upholstery on there that's done really
VTEhYwtjTjo,102399,104880,well and here we're starting to see some
VTEhYwtjTjo,104880,106079,of the options that you get there's a
VTEhYwtjTjo,106079,108079,lot of different configurations for this
VTEhYwtjTjo,108079,110079,boat so you can really tailor this to
VTEhYwtjTjo,110079,111840,exactly how you want it so on this one
VTEhYwtjTjo,111840,113439,what the owner has gone for is a bench
VTEhYwtjTjo,113439,114640,seat here
VTEhYwtjTjo,114640,117360,and then over here there is this area
VTEhYwtjTjo,117360,119200,which is
VTEhYwtjTjo,119200,120719,a grill
VTEhYwtjTjo,120719,124479,and then there's sink in there
VTEhYwtjTjo,124560,128599,and then you've also got
VTEhYwtjTjo,129039,130560,ice maker underneath and there's room
VTEhYwtjTjo,130560,132879,for a fridge next to it if you want as
VTEhYwtjTjo,132879,134000,well this is just storage on this
VTEhYwtjTjo,134000,135840,particular boat however
VTEhYwtjTjo,135840,137280,if you prefer
VTEhYwtjTjo,137280,139360,you can have a bar here so what that
VTEhYwtjTjo,139360,141200,means is that this flip over section
VTEhYwtjTjo,141200,143120,here and the reason that this is here is
VTEhYwtjTjo,143120,144800,because that's a power window that comes
VTEhYwtjTjo,144800,146640,up to close off the saloon there's a
VTEhYwtjTjo,146640,148160,door that slides across here as well of
VTEhYwtjTjo,148160,150239,course but you can have this much larger
VTEhYwtjTjo,150239,152080,so that if you don't have that you can
VTEhYwtjTjo,152080,153760,have a bar area here a couple of stools
VTEhYwtjTjo,153760,155599,facing in very nice place have a drink
VTEhYwtjTjo,155599,157519,of an evening but there's more because
VTEhYwtjTjo,157519,159440,if you would rather you can bring this
VTEhYwtjTjo,159440,162400,seating all the way around do away with
VTEhYwtjTjo,162400,164080,that or the bar area and just have
VTEhYwtjTjo,164080,165440,heating all the way up here and across
VTEhYwtjTjo,165440,167519,here and make this a really massive
VTEhYwtjTjo,167519,170000,social area the table here you can see
VTEhYwtjTjo,170000,171519,it's got hinges on that folds out to
VTEhYwtjTjo,171519,173519,twice its size just comes over and rests
VTEhYwtjTjo,173519,176239,over onto this part here this one's also
VTEhYwtjTjo,176239,178720,got the extending bimini that comes out
VTEhYwtjTjo,178720,181040,of the back of the overhang and in fact
VTEhYwtjTjo,181040,182480,this one is as i mentioned the sport
VTEhYwtjTjo,182480,183840,yacht that means it's got the fly bridge
VTEhYwtjTjo,183840,185360,and i will show you that of course
VTEhYwtjTjo,185360,187200,intriguingly there's also a predator
VTEhYwtjTjo,187200,189360,version and i'll explain a difference to
VTEhYwtjTjo,189360,191120,that when we go inside
VTEhYwtjTjo,191120,192640,now as we go into here again you're
VTEhYwtjTjo,192640,193760,going to see a lot of different options
VTEhYwtjTjo,193760,195920,this has got the galley aft layout and i
VTEhYwtjTjo,195920,198080,will explain why that is an option a bit
VTEhYwtjTjo,198080,199360,further into the boat that'll make more
VTEhYwtjTjo,199360,201200,sense but what you've got here
VTEhYwtjTjo,201200,203440,is you've got your miele oven and your
VTEhYwtjTjo,203440,205680,hob some lovely details like the way
VTEhYwtjTjo,205680,207280,that they've done
VTEhYwtjTjo,207280,208159,this
VTEhYwtjTjo,208159,211280,for the crockery in places like that and
VTEhYwtjTjo,211280,212799,it's a similar deal actually if you go
VTEhYwtjTjo,212799,214959,over onto this side
VTEhYwtjTjo,214959,218159,look at these for the cutlery
VTEhYwtjTjo,218720,221440,very nice
VTEhYwtjTjo,223040,226480,and then there's storage about the place
VTEhYwtjTjo,226480,230319,and a bin and so forth and
VTEhYwtjTjo,230720,234000,a slimline dishwasher there
VTEhYwtjTjo,234720,236159,now what you'll notice is there's no
VTEhYwtjTjo,236159,237040,fridge and that's because the
VTEhYwtjTjo,237040,238640,refrigeration is over on this side of
VTEhYwtjTjo,238640,242319,the boat so that is
VTEhYwtjTjo,242560,244959,in here
VTEhYwtjTjo,246560,248000,now one of the things i do like is the
VTEhYwtjTjo,248000,250159,fact that this is completely flat from
VTEhYwtjTjo,250159,251280,the cockpit
VTEhYwtjTjo,251280,253439,right through this whole main deck right
VTEhYwtjTjo,253439,255120,up to the front where you go down to the
VTEhYwtjTjo,255120,257359,lower deck so that's a really lovely
VTEhYwtjTjo,257359,259919,area to go on through you've got this
VTEhYwtjTjo,259919,261840,area which can be for relaxing or for
VTEhYwtjTjo,261840,263440,dining and in fact that table is a high
VTEhYwtjTjo,263440,265600,low table it's an electric
VTEhYwtjTjo,265600,267040,table leg and also you can see little
VTEhYwtjTjo,267040,268880,hinges that all folds out much larger so
VTEhYwtjTjo,268880,270320,you can have it folded down as a little
VTEhYwtjTjo,270320,272560,coffee table or lifted up and opened out
VTEhYwtjTjo,272560,274639,for a bit of internal dining
VTEhYwtjTjo,274639,277040,tv is fixed just here but if you prefer
VTEhYwtjTjo,277040,278880,you can have a tv that folds away and a
VTEhYwtjTjo,278880,280720,bit more seating over on this side
VTEhYwtjTjo,280720,282160,there's a lot of little details that
VTEhYwtjTjo,282160,283680,you'll notice like for example these
VTEhYwtjTjo,283680,285360,stainless steel fillets they put into
VTEhYwtjTjo,285360,286479,here
VTEhYwtjTjo,286479,287919,that incidentally
VTEhYwtjTjo,287919,290560,is the wine cooler
VTEhYwtjTjo,290560,291919,and again more stainless here with these
VTEhYwtjTjo,291919,293440,sort of grab areas
VTEhYwtjTjo,293440,295120,like so
VTEhYwtjTjo,295120,298000,now this one has got this
VTEhYwtjTjo,298000,299680,glass roof section that tilts for
VTEhYwtjTjo,299680,301520,ventilation that's a nice feature i
VTEhYwtjTjo,301520,302880,mentioned the predator if you go for the
VTEhYwtjTjo,302880,305520,predator you don't have a flybridge
VTEhYwtjTjo,305520,307520,so you have a smooth roof but then you
VTEhYwtjTjo,307520,309360,have a massive opening section so this
VTEhYwtjTjo,309360,311840,whole area here will slide back so if
VTEhYwtjTjo,311840,313759,you prefer that configuration then it
VTEhYwtjTjo,313759,314720,can be done you just opt for the
VTEhYwtjTjo,314720,316160,predator version
VTEhYwtjTjo,316160,318400,if we head on forward again it all keeps
VTEhYwtjTjo,318400,320880,on coming home area is here there's an
VTEhYwtjTjo,320880,322960,ipad dock look at the way they've done
VTEhYwtjTjo,322960,325039,this though so this is proper sort of
VTEhYwtjTjo,325039,327039,retro styling across here like a vintage
VTEhYwtjTjo,327039,329520,car i love these recessed dials like an
VTEhYwtjTjo,329520,331120,old sports car but
VTEhYwtjTjo,331120,332320,what you can do with these there's a
VTEhYwtjTjo,332320,334720,little control knob here
VTEhYwtjTjo,334720,336720,and as you turn that
VTEhYwtjTjo,336720,338639,it reconfigures these depending on what
VTEhYwtjTjo,338639,340000,you want
VTEhYwtjTjo,340000,342080,so it's a beautiful meld of latest
VTEhYwtjTjo,342080,343680,technology but with that old-fashioned
VTEhYwtjTjo,343680,345280,styling then you've got your garmin
VTEhYwtjTjo,345280,348000,screens up above there so navigation and
VTEhYwtjTjo,348000,350000,radar and that kind of stuff and then
VTEhYwtjTjo,350000,352880,over here engine controls ips docking
VTEhYwtjTjo,352880,355759,control and so forth
VTEhYwtjTjo,355759,357520,another thing to look at is this screen
VTEhYwtjTjo,357520,360080,it's a massive one-piece windscreen and
VTEhYwtjTjo,360080,361840,it's a double curvature so it curves
VTEhYwtjTjo,361840,364319,that way but it also curves that way
VTEhYwtjTjo,364319,366880,that is a very expensive piece of glass
VTEhYwtjTjo,366880,368080,it didn't tell me how much it was but i
VTEhYwtjTjo,368080,370560,don't think i repeated it it was a lot
VTEhYwtjTjo,370560,372400,um let's move on a bit further again you
VTEhYwtjTjo,372400,373919,see those integrate these grab rails and
VTEhYwtjTjo,373919,376400,places like this it's a nice idea
VTEhYwtjTjo,376400,377919,you've got steps on down to the lower
VTEhYwtjTjo,377919,379680,deck then and that brings you down to
VTEhYwtjTjo,379680,381840,this lobby area
VTEhYwtjTjo,381840,384560,now again various choices down here and
VTEhYwtjTjo,384560,386000,i will explain if we head on through
VTEhYwtjTjo,386000,387360,here first of all
VTEhYwtjTjo,387360,390800,this then is the vip guest cabin really
VTEhYwtjTjo,390800,392000,good size
VTEhYwtjTjo,392000,393600,really nicely done love the way they've
VTEhYwtjTjo,393600,394960,done the trick lighting in places like
VTEhYwtjTjo,394960,397520,this and across the back here all very
VTEhYwtjTjo,397520,399919,nice and also things like this
VTEhYwtjTjo,399919,401280,so that lifts up
VTEhYwtjTjo,401280,403600,like that to give you a little dressing
VTEhYwtjTjo,403600,404800,area
VTEhYwtjTjo,404800,408080,you have of course got
VTEhYwtjTjo,408080,409680,illuminated hanging lockers in places
VTEhYwtjTjo,409680,411759,like that and then you've got
VTEhYwtjTjo,411759,413759,storage
VTEhYwtjTjo,413759,416080,up behind here and so forth
VTEhYwtjTjo,416080,417919,big windows in here as well so great
VTEhYwtjTjo,417919,419680,view out
VTEhYwtjTjo,419680,421199,we are at the cam boat show at the
VTEhYwtjTjo,421199,423599,moment this is interesting they finish
VTEhYwtjTjo,423599,425360,this for you drop your watch another
VTEhYwtjTjo,425360,426960,bits and pieces into there but that area
VTEhYwtjTjo,426960,429440,there is an inductive charging
VTEhYwtjTjo,429440,430560,area so if you drop your phone into
VTEhYwtjTjo,430560,432000,there and it charges it for you
VTEhYwtjTjo,432000,434000,overnight again more of this lovely
VTEhYwtjTjo,434000,435440,detailing look at this the way this has
VTEhYwtjTjo,435440,437599,been back lit and stainless steel edged
VTEhYwtjTjo,437599,440400,that's really nice
VTEhYwtjTjo,440400,442000,let's come back a bit further there's
VTEhYwtjTjo,442000,444319,drawers under the bed these hatches here
VTEhYwtjTjo,444319,446880,are access hatches for systems so that's
VTEhYwtjTjo,446880,448080,a quick sneaky look at that when i'll
VTEhYwtjTjo,448080,450880,show you what i mean
VTEhYwtjTjo,450880,452720,there we go bow thruster for example in
VTEhYwtjTjo,452720,455199,that one and incredibly
VTEhYwtjTjo,455199,457039,that's lit i don't think i've ever seen
VTEhYwtjTjo,457039,458720,that before
VTEhYwtjTjo,458720,460880,that there right there that's attention
VTEhYwtjTjo,460880,463840,to detail that's brilliant
VTEhYwtjTjo,463840,466240,equipment in here and you also have as
VTEhYwtjTjo,466240,468639,you would expect
VTEhYwtjTjo,468639,471440,an ensuite so that's in there
VTEhYwtjTjo,471440,475120,separate rainfall shower
VTEhYwtjTjo,475520,476479,and then
VTEhYwtjTjo,476479,478800,that's obviously a sink and storage
VTEhYwtjTjo,478800,480479,again in
VTEhYwtjTjo,480479,483520,little areas like this
VTEhYwtjTjo,485360,489199,so that is the ensuite to that cabin
VTEhYwtjTjo,489199,490639,and there's something i've not really
VTEhYwtjTjo,490639,492080,seen on this size boat before and that
VTEhYwtjTjo,492080,495918,is that there's a third cabin here
VTEhYwtjTjo,496080,498160,that in itself not too unusual very
VTEhYwtjTjo,498160,499680,nicely done
VTEhYwtjTjo,499680,501360,at two single beds as you can see again
VTEhYwtjTjo,501360,502960,a lot of trick lighting around in places
VTEhYwtjTjo,502960,505120,like this and up around here but this
VTEhYwtjTjo,505120,508240,has got its own ensuite
VTEhYwtjTjo,510960,512479,up into there so it's completely
VTEhYwtjTjo,512479,514560,separate ensuite
VTEhYwtjTjo,514560,517518,now the thing is
VTEhYwtjTjo,518159,520080,that the master cabin which i'll show in
VTEhYwtjTjo,520080,521839,a minute also has non-suite so that's
VTEhYwtjTjo,521839,524320,fine three ensuite cabins in a 65-foot
VTEhYwtjTjo,524320,525600,boat brilliant
VTEhYwtjTjo,525600,527040,would you believe
VTEhYwtjTjo,527040,529920,if we go over here
VTEhYwtjTjo,530640,532320,there's a day heads
VTEhYwtjTjo,532320,534240,so not only are all the cabins on suite
VTEhYwtjTjo,534240,536160,there's also a separate dedicated day
VTEhYwtjTjo,536160,537600,heads as well that's what i don't think
VTEhYwtjTjo,537600,539279,i've ever seen on the 65-foot sports
VTEhYwtjTjo,539279,542480,cruiser before that's remarkable
VTEhYwtjTjo,542480,545120,i've seen it on full flybridge boats but
VTEhYwtjTjo,545120,549120,not on a sports cruiser like this
VTEhYwtjTjo,549120,550399,okay we're gonna talk about options
VTEhYwtjTjo,550399,551839,again now because
VTEhYwtjTjo,551839,555120,this doorway here takes you back into
VTEhYwtjTjo,555120,555920,the
VTEhYwtjTjo,555920,557680,owner's cabin and this is impressive
VTEhYwtjTjo,557680,559920,because what it drops you down into
VTEhYwtjTjo,559920,563519,is this big lobby area just here
VTEhYwtjTjo,563519,565600,separate to the actual sort of sleeping
VTEhYwtjTjo,565600,567600,area and through there what's nice about
VTEhYwtjTjo,567600,569839,this is imagine if you want to work on
VTEhYwtjTjo,569839,571519,the boat spend a lot of time on it you
VTEhYwtjTjo,571519,572959,could use this as an officer area and
VTEhYwtjTjo,572959,574959,keep it completely separate this pulls
VTEhYwtjTjo,574959,577200,out
VTEhYwtjTjo,577200,579600,like so so you can sit there and work or
VTEhYwtjTjo,579600,581120,do your makeup or whatever else you want
VTEhYwtjTjo,581120,582720,to do there
VTEhYwtjTjo,582720,585680,and that is a really lovely comfortable
VTEhYwtjTjo,585680,588080,area to come into load more storage
VTEhYwtjTjo,588080,589200,again
VTEhYwtjTjo,589200,591440,in places like this
VTEhYwtjTjo,591440,592880,the lighting again up through here
VTEhYwtjTjo,592880,595760,that's all very nice drawers underneath
VTEhYwtjTjo,595760,597760,now over on this side there is space for
VTEhYwtjTjo,597760,599200,a washing machine but this particular
VTEhYwtjTjo,599200,600800,owner has chosen not to have a washing
VTEhYwtjTjo,600800,601760,machine
VTEhYwtjTjo,601760,603440,there we go
VTEhYwtjTjo,603440,604800,he's chosen have a big fridge in his
VTEhYwtjTjo,604800,607279,cabin instead good for him or her of
VTEhYwtjTjo,607279,609120,course i don't know
VTEhYwtjTjo,609120,610240,there's a pocket door on this
VTEhYwtjTjo,610240,613760,incidentally so that
VTEhYwtjTjo,613760,617640,slides across like that
VTEhYwtjTjo,618720,620480,okay let's head on back a bit further
VTEhYwtjTjo,620480,622800,and talk about more options in a second
VTEhYwtjTjo,622800,625200,this then is
VTEhYwtjTjo,625200,627040,the owner's cabin
VTEhYwtjTjo,627040,629040,and that is lovely full beam of the boat
VTEhYwtjTjo,629040,631600,again a lot more this trick lighting and
VTEhYwtjTjo,631600,633120,a lot more of these lovely finishes on
VTEhYwtjTjo,633120,635360,the doors that's into the ensuite
VTEhYwtjTjo,635360,637040,huge tv in here as well a lovely place
VTEhYwtjTjo,637040,638320,to come and tuck yourself away and watch
VTEhYwtjTjo,638320,639680,a movie
VTEhYwtjTjo,639680,642399,if we go around here this takes us into
VTEhYwtjTjo,642399,643279,the
VTEhYwtjTjo,643279,645200,ensuite loves the finishing areas like
VTEhYwtjTjo,645200,647279,this that looks really smart toilet
VTEhYwtjTjo,647279,648399,there of course
VTEhYwtjTjo,648399,652320,and and then a separate rainfall shower
VTEhYwtjTjo,652320,654800,in here
VTEhYwtjTjo,656240,659040,but that is a nice cabin isn't it
VTEhYwtjTjo,659040,660640,beautiful
VTEhYwtjTjo,660640,663200,okay let's head on a bit further because
VTEhYwtjTjo,663200,666399,i want to talk about options
VTEhYwtjTjo,666880,670079,you can if you wish choose
VTEhYwtjTjo,670079,672399,to have instead of that door there a
VTEhYwtjTjo,672399,673920,door here and in fact i think they bring
VTEhYwtjTjo,673920,676000,the whole thing over a little bit
VTEhYwtjTjo,676000,677440,and that means you can use this for
VTEhYwtjTjo,677440,679200,something else and the options that you
VTEhYwtjTjo,679200,681440,have are you can have a fourth cabin
VTEhYwtjTjo,681440,683360,with bunk beds in
VTEhYwtjTjo,683360,684560,so that'll take you up to obviously a
VTEhYwtjTjo,684560,686480,full cabin layout
VTEhYwtjTjo,686480,688079,and also it means of course that that
VTEhYwtjTjo,688079,689360,extra toilet comes in they're very handy
VTEhYwtjTjo,689360,690399,because it means all the cabinets still
VTEhYwtjTjo,690399,692000,have their own toilet but another
VTEhYwtjTjo,692000,693519,intriguing option is that if you want
VTEhYwtjTjo,693519,695200,you can have a galley down here so how
VTEhYwtjTjo,695200,697440,this is a cabin and this is the galley
VTEhYwtjTjo,697440,699279,and then you don't have that galley off
VTEhYwtjTjo,699279,700720,layout on the main deck what you do up
VTEhYwtjTjo,700720,702959,there is have a load more seating
VTEhYwtjTjo,702959,704959,so it just depends how you're using the
VTEhYwtjTjo,704959,706640,boat and what your preferences are but
VTEhYwtjTjo,706640,707920,it's really great to see all these
VTEhYwtjTjo,707920,709680,different options and be able to choose
VTEhYwtjTjo,709680,711360,exactly what you want more is access
VTEhYwtjTjo,711360,715120,hatches here again these are for systems
VTEhYwtjTjo,715600,717760,like so
VTEhYwtjTjo,717760,719839,plumbing in there
VTEhYwtjTjo,719839,721440,what else can i show you oh you might
VTEhYwtjTjo,721440,722560,notice these hinges people are going to
VTEhYwtjTjo,722560,724800,ask what's under the hinges
VTEhYwtjTjo,724800,726240,that
VTEhYwtjTjo,726240,728160,just a big storage area back underneath
VTEhYwtjTjo,728160,731160,there
VTEhYwtjTjo,734320,736880,there we go
VTEhYwtjTjo,737680,740320,so that is the accommodation
VTEhYwtjTjo,740320,741600,love features like this look at the way
VTEhYwtjTjo,741600,742480,they've done this with lighting
VTEhYwtjTjo,742480,744639,underneath but also
VTEhYwtjTjo,744639,746399,the lighting up above as well that's
VTEhYwtjTjo,746399,748000,rather nifty
VTEhYwtjTjo,748000,751279,let's carry on up a bit further
VTEhYwtjTjo,753040,754240,so this is what i mean if you had the
VTEhYwtjTjo,754240,756800,galley down layout then this can extend
VTEhYwtjTjo,756800,758399,your seating all the way back
VTEhYwtjTjo,758399,760000,you could have this as a massive social
VTEhYwtjTjo,760000,760959,area if you wanted because you could
VTEhYwtjTjo,760959,762560,have the seating on this side as well
VTEhYwtjTjo,762560,765120,with the hilo tv instead of that one and
VTEhYwtjTjo,765120,768000,really have the ultimate party boat
VTEhYwtjTjo,768000,769360,brilliant
VTEhYwtjTjo,769360,771200,loads more to see let's go and take a
VTEhYwtjTjo,771200,773839,look at the decks
VTEhYwtjTjo,774000,777200,and pop your shoes back on
VTEhYwtjTjo,777200,779040,there we go
VTEhYwtjTjo,779040,781360,okay we'll head around this way there's
VTEhYwtjTjo,781360,783120,doors in the side in america for example
VTEhYwtjTjo,783120,785120,they often more alongside a key so
VTEhYwtjTjo,785120,786880,that's a great way on and off
VTEhYwtjTjo,786880,788639,again more little detailing let me put
VTEhYwtjTjo,788639,790880,these sun seeker logos in the scuppers
VTEhYwtjTjo,790880,792240,so that's the water that comes down sort
VTEhYwtjTjo,792240,793760,of running back into the cockpit it
VTEhYwtjTjo,793760,796320,drains down through there and also if we
VTEhYwtjTjo,796320,799600,come back here you've got stern
VTEhYwtjTjo,799600,801200,winches for when you are winching into
VTEhYwtjTjo,801200,802800,the key when your stern two birthing but
VTEhYwtjTjo,802800,804160,look at where they put this little
VTEhYwtjTjo,804160,805839,stainless steel plate on where you can
VTEhYwtjTjo,805839,808399,see that yeah there we go with a 65 logo
VTEhYwtjTjo,808399,810240,that is a little rope bin
VTEhYwtjTjo,810240,811360,so that when you've winched in you can
VTEhYwtjTjo,811360,812839,drop your ropes into
VTEhYwtjTjo,812839,815360,there let's head on around look at this
VTEhYwtjTjo,815360,819360,glazing on here it's huge isn't it
VTEhYwtjTjo,820560,823360,that's come right up
VTEhYwtjTjo,823360,824880,now this is interesting you've got this
VTEhYwtjTjo,824880,826639,beautiful line you can see the way it
VTEhYwtjTjo,826639,828720,follows down here and quite often when
VTEhYwtjTjo,828720,830639,you get that you end up with like a cut
VTEhYwtjTjo,830639,832880,out where the seating is across the
VTEhYwtjTjo,832880,834959,front what they've done with this
VTEhYwtjTjo,834959,837360,is they've kept this line intact all the
VTEhYwtjTjo,837360,839600,way through so you don't spoil the lines
VTEhYwtjTjo,839600,840560,of the boat it does mean you have to
VTEhYwtjTjo,840560,843120,step across to get into this area
VTEhYwtjTjo,843120,844720,but it does mean obviously it is a
VTEhYwtjTjo,844720,846320,sports boat it is about style and
VTEhYwtjTjo,846320,847600,performance
VTEhYwtjTjo,847600,849680,you keep those beautiful looks rather
VTEhYwtjTjo,849680,851519,than having that sort of break
VTEhYwtjTjo,851519,853839,in the in the section there
VTEhYwtjTjo,853839,856000,also very very handy for keeping
VTEhYwtjTjo,856000,858720,extremely small dogs in
VTEhYwtjTjo,858720,860240,okay i made that up
VTEhYwtjTjo,860240,861600,these are
VTEhYwtjTjo,861600,863600,carbon fiber poles and that is to
VTEhYwtjTjo,863600,865760,support the bimini that this one's got
VTEhYwtjTjo,865760,867600,over this area obviously you don't run
VTEhYwtjTjo,867600,868880,with that up that's just when you're an
VTEhYwtjTjo,868880,871360,anchor or perhaps you'll birth in the
VTEhYwtjTjo,871360,873440,med stern to the uh to the key and you
VTEhYwtjTjo,873440,874320,want to have a bit more privacy so
VTEhYwtjTjo,874320,875360,you're up here on the front instead of
VTEhYwtjTjo,875360,878320,at the back that's what that does um
VTEhYwtjTjo,878320,879839,something here of course and then
VTEhYwtjTjo,879839,881600,seating around there
VTEhYwtjTjo,881600,882959,let's head on around a bit more because
VTEhYwtjTjo,882959,884240,i really want to show you the flybridge
VTEhYwtjTjo,884240,886959,on this it's intriguing
VTEhYwtjTjo,886959,890079,these are little
VTEhYwtjTjo,891279,892959,storage bins in here and they drain as
VTEhYwtjTjo,892959,894800,well which is nice
VTEhYwtjTjo,894800,896720,so put wet fenders or ropes in there
VTEhYwtjTjo,896720,898079,they're going to stay wet the water can
VTEhYwtjTjo,898079,900079,get away look at this windscreen this is
VTEhYwtjTjo,900079,901680,what i was talking about this double
VTEhYwtjTjo,901680,903680,curvature windscreen it curves that way
VTEhYwtjTjo,903680,906320,and it curves that way that is
VTEhYwtjTjo,906320,908320,a serious piece of glass
VTEhYwtjTjo,908320,909600,and that's that opening section we
VTEhYwtjTjo,909600,912160,looked at above the helm
VTEhYwtjTjo,912160,915519,okay let's carry on back
VTEhYwtjTjo,915519,917519,down this side
VTEhYwtjTjo,917519,920959,because we're gonna swing around
VTEhYwtjTjo,920959,925320,and head up onto the fly bridge
VTEhYwtjTjo,926000,927600,and this is intriguing look what they've
VTEhYwtjTjo,927600,929519,done here
VTEhYwtjTjo,929519,931920,now this is a sports performance boat
VTEhYwtjTjo,931920,934480,you can opt for up to 2 000 horsepower
VTEhYwtjTjo,934480,936240,so you can have twin 1000 horsepower
VTEhYwtjTjo,936240,937920,engines so it's got some serious grunt
VTEhYwtjTjo,937920,939360,we'll talk about that in a minute but
VTEhYwtjTjo,939360,940880,look at these seats they've turned this
VTEhYwtjTjo,940880,943040,into like a sports car area
VTEhYwtjTjo,943040,945519,this looks fantastic what a dynamic
VTEhYwtjTjo,945519,946959,place to drive the boat from you'll be
VTEhYwtjTjo,946959,948000,thinking well that's fine but what's
VTEhYwtjTjo,948000,949279,that steering wheel doing up in the air
VTEhYwtjTjo,949279,951920,like that i'll show you the idea of this
VTEhYwtjTjo,951920,954560,and it's genius frankly is that you can
VTEhYwtjTjo,954560,956079,stand here okay you're moving the boat
VTEhYwtjTjo,956079,957360,into an area like this it's all very
VTEhYwtjTjo,957360,958560,tight you want to stand up see what
VTEhYwtjTjo,958560,959839,you're doing
VTEhYwtjTjo,959839,961199,you can stand here and the helm is right
VTEhYwtjTjo,961199,962320,here where you need it the joystick
VTEhYwtjTjo,962320,963839,controls right here where you need it
VTEhYwtjTjo,963839,966240,you can stand and look out
VTEhYwtjTjo,966240,968560,and get the kind of view that you need
VTEhYwtjTjo,968560,969680,however
VTEhYwtjTjo,969680,971199,you get out the harbor you want to go
VTEhYwtjTjo,971199,973839,into sports car mode
VTEhYwtjTjo,973839,977040,park yourself down here
VTEhYwtjTjo,977199,978560,drop that down
VTEhYwtjTjo,978560,980720,and we are ready to go
VTEhYwtjTjo,980720,982800,look at that that is a proper sports car
VTEhYwtjTjo,982800,984560,driving experience because you've got
VTEhYwtjTjo,984560,986720,the bucket seat you've got your feet on
VTEhYwtjTjo,986720,988480,these supports here the wheel is right
VTEhYwtjTjo,988480,990959,here and suddenly you can really enjoy
VTEhYwtjTjo,990959,992399,the performance of this bait what a
VTEhYwtjTjo,992399,993920,brilliant place to drive a boat from
VTEhYwtjTjo,993920,995680,that is absolutely fantastic you could
VTEhYwtjTjo,995680,997600,really have some fun with this boat they
VTEhYwtjTjo,997600,999440,put the throttles down here feels a bit
VTEhYwtjTjo,999440,1001519,like you're in an aircraft
VTEhYwtjTjo,1001519,1003120,and then you've got your garmin screen
VTEhYwtjTjo,1003120,1005440,down there for your navigation and those
VTEhYwtjTjo,1005440,1007120,instruments again like we saw down at
VTEhYwtjTjo,1007120,1008320,the lower helm
VTEhYwtjTjo,1008320,1010079,which again you've got a selector here
VTEhYwtjTjo,1010079,1012160,you can flick through and you can dial
VTEhYwtjTjo,1012160,1013600,up whatever you want to display in the
VTEhYwtjTjo,1013600,1014880,center so you have revs around the
VTEhYwtjTjo,1014880,1016320,outside this one's configured to knots
VTEhYwtjTjo,1016320,1017839,at the minute and then this one over
VTEhYwtjTjo,1017839,1019920,here is now on depth or as you can see
VTEhYwtjTjo,1019920,1021600,it's flicking through rudder
VTEhYwtjTjo,1021600,1024160,and so on there we go course overground
VTEhYwtjTjo,1024160,1026400,whatever you want to have that set to
VTEhYwtjTjo,1026400,1028319,you've also got controls down here for
VTEhYwtjTjo,1028319,1029600,the garmin screen so those remote
VTEhYwtjTjo,1029600,1031438,controls for that you'd have to reach
VTEhYwtjTjo,1031438,1033360,and pull away at the screen that little
VTEhYwtjTjo,1033360,1035600,photo there's a scan scut scan scut i'll
VTEhYwtjTjo,1035600,1038480,try again that is a scan strut charger
VTEhYwtjTjo,1038480,1039760,so you drop your phone into there i
VTEhYwtjTjo,1039760,1042319,wonder if it's on let's have a look
VTEhYwtjTjo,1042319,1043600,i've got one of these on my boat this is
VTEhYwtjTjo,1043600,1044880,the only thing that my boat has in
VTEhYwtjTjo,1044880,1046319,common with this one
VTEhYwtjTjo,1046319,1048319,um all right
VTEhYwtjTjo,1048319,1049760,so that does that
VTEhYwtjTjo,1049760,1051360,there we go charging up
VTEhYwtjTjo,1051360,1054240,and there's also another uh scan
VTEhYwtjTjo,1054240,1056240,can't speak today scan
VTEhYwtjTjo,1056240,1057440,scan strut
VTEhYwtjTjo,1057440,1059280,charger here this one i got one of these
VTEhYwtjTjo,1059280,1060559,on my boat as well
VTEhYwtjTjo,1060559,1062160,that's for uh that's for plugging
VTEhYwtjTjo,1062160,1064000,where's it gone there we are over there
VTEhYwtjTjo,1064000,1065600,usb is
VTEhYwtjTjo,1065600,1066880,but charging whatever you want to charge
VTEhYwtjTjo,1066880,1068240,on there let's take that off before i
VTEhYwtjTjo,1068240,1070160,wander off and forget it
VTEhYwtjTjo,1070160,1071760,that's the only thing that my boat has
VTEhYwtjTjo,1071760,1072799,in common with this one that and the
VTEhYwtjTjo,1072799,1074480,fact that it floats
VTEhYwtjTjo,1074480,1076640,but isn't this brilliant
VTEhYwtjTjo,1076640,1078480,it is such a nice idea i can just
VTEhYwtjTjo,1078480,1080160,imagine coming out with this and just
VTEhYwtjTjo,1080160,1081520,having such a blast with it which you
VTEhYwtjTjo,1081520,1083120,kind of don't normally do with a 65-foot
VTEhYwtjTjo,1083120,1085120,boat but with this you definitely could
VTEhYwtjTjo,1085120,1086480,uh what else can i show you up here if
VTEhYwtjTjo,1086480,1088880,you go on around the back
VTEhYwtjTjo,1088880,1091520,you've got a draw fridge down here so
VTEhYwtjTjo,1091520,1093039,you can keep drinks cool
VTEhYwtjTjo,1093039,1094240,again more of this lovely stainless
VTEhYwtjTjo,1094240,1095840,steel detailing down across in places
VTEhYwtjTjo,1095840,1097760,like this this has got lift up sections
VTEhYwtjTjo,1097760,1099360,so you can sit facing forward you can
VTEhYwtjTjo,1099360,1100880,drop it flat and in fact they're at this
VTEhYwtjTjo,1100880,1103039,end as well so that will lift up in the
VTEhYwtjTjo,1103039,1104080,same way so if you want to face
VTEhYwtjTjo,1104080,1106000,backwards you can do love the fact
VTEhYwtjTjo,1106000,1108559,they've color-coded everything the radar
VTEhYwtjTjo,1108559,1111120,the searchlight the gps aerials the
VTEhYwtjTjo,1111120,1113360,antennas everything's color-coded black
VTEhYwtjTjo,1113360,1116559,that's nice detailing
VTEhYwtjTjo,1116559,1118640,that's fantastic but i love that i think
VTEhYwtjTjo,1118640,1121440,that is a really neat feature it's fun
VTEhYwtjTjo,1121440,1122480,and that's what these sorts of boats
VTEhYwtjTjo,1122480,1124880,should be all about
VTEhYwtjTjo,1124880,1126559,let's press on a bit further
VTEhYwtjTjo,1126559,1129200,more to see would you believe okay back
VTEhYwtjTjo,1129200,1131679,down here
VTEhYwtjTjo,1134799,1136640,now these boats are typically owner
VTEhYwtjTjo,1136640,1138080,operated and that's why you've got that
VTEhYwtjTjo,1138080,1139600,wonderful driving position however there
VTEhYwtjTjo,1139600,1141120,is space for a crew if you wanted to
VTEhYwtjTjo,1141120,1142400,occasionally perhaps doing a longer
VTEhYwtjTjo,1142400,1144000,journey you want to take somebody with
VTEhYwtjTjo,1144000,1145760,you just for an overnight there is a
VTEhYwtjTjo,1145760,1147840,space underneath here we lift that color
VTEhYwtjTjo,1147840,1149280,up
VTEhYwtjTjo,1149280,1152320,and open that one
VTEhYwtjTjo,1154240,1156160,now if you are looking to have regular
VTEhYwtjTjo,1156160,1158400,crew this isn't the boat for you as i
VTEhYwtjTjo,1158400,1160559,say this really is an occasional extra
VTEhYwtjTjo,1160559,1161600,space
VTEhYwtjTjo,1161600,1163760,you might want to you know a teenager to
VTEhYwtjTjo,1163760,1166640,come and sleep in here out of the way
VTEhYwtjTjo,1166640,1168640,tricky blight as they can be
VTEhYwtjTjo,1168640,1170080,but we'll go on down have a look you
VTEhYwtjTjo,1170080,1171360,could also just configure this as a
VTEhYwtjTjo,1171360,1173360,storage area if you wanted to
VTEhYwtjTjo,1173360,1174640,which is to be honest is what a lot of
VTEhYwtjTjo,1174640,1176400,them get used for but
VTEhYwtjTjo,1176400,1178320,you have got a full-size adult bed in
VTEhYwtjTjo,1178320,1180960,here and there is a loo
VTEhYwtjTjo,1180960,1183840,down underneath there
VTEhYwtjTjo,1183919,1185440,and
VTEhYwtjTjo,1185440,1187280,a little sink in here as well but i have
VTEhYwtjTjo,1187280,1189280,to stress again
VTEhYwtjTjo,1189280,1192400,this isn't a normal crew boat so people
VTEhYwtjTjo,1192400,1193840,look at these lines go i wouldn't let my
VTEhYwtjTjo,1193840,1195039,crew sleep someone like one no well if
VTEhYwtjTjo,1195039,1196640,you had crew you would be buying this
VTEhYwtjTjo,1196640,1198480,boat it is just an occasional extra
VTEhYwtjTjo,1198480,1199520,space
VTEhYwtjTjo,1199520,1201039,for when it's needed
VTEhYwtjTjo,1201039,1203679,some feet going past
VTEhYwtjTjo,1203679,1207120,last thing to show you then is engines
VTEhYwtjTjo,1207120,1209520,and we access those
VTEhYwtjTjo,1209520,1212960,let's drop that one back down first
VTEhYwtjTjo,1217840,1219120,there we go
VTEhYwtjTjo,1219120,1221120,over here
VTEhYwtjTjo,1221120,1223120,so these lovely stainless steel doors we
VTEhYwtjTjo,1223120,1225679,close those over first of all
VTEhYwtjTjo,1225679,1226720,like that again you've got this
VTEhYwtjTjo,1226720,1229360,beautiful engraved sunseeker logos these
VTEhYwtjTjo,1229360,1230960,are the switches things like the lights
VTEhYwtjTjo,1230960,1232480,and the garage open
VTEhYwtjTjo,1232480,1234400,and the bathing platform up and down
VTEhYwtjTjo,1234400,1235600,that kind of stuff is all controlled
VTEhYwtjTjo,1235600,1239360,from there and this one then
VTEhYwtjTjo,1240480,1244520,takes us down to the engine compartment
VTEhYwtjTjo,1257600,1260320,so in here are
VTEhYwtjTjo,1260320,1262799,a pair of volvo penta
VTEhYwtjTjo,1262799,1265679,ips 1350 engines
VTEhYwtjTjo,1265679,1266720,there we go
VTEhYwtjTjo,1266720,1269520,they are a thousand horsepower each and
VTEhYwtjTjo,1269520,1271520,they're giving the boat a top speed of
VTEhYwtjTjo,1271520,1273520,35 knots
VTEhYwtjTjo,1273520,1274720,but what's interesting is that if you
VTEhYwtjTjo,1274720,1276240,drop the speed right back if you cruise
VTEhYwtjTjo,1276240,1278799,at 10 knots to get your maximum range
VTEhYwtjTjo,1278799,1281039,you'll get 750 nautical miles out of
VTEhYwtjTjo,1281039,1282960,this so you've got a distance if you
VTEhYwtjTjo,1282960,1284400,want it you've got the performance if
VTEhYwtjTjo,1284400,1286080,you want it
VTEhYwtjTjo,1286080,1287600,well it's a nice engine space isn't it
VTEhYwtjTjo,1287600,1289360,all those engines
VTEhYwtjTjo,1289360,1290880,they also do
VTEhYwtjTjo,1290880,1293280,a 900 horsepower version of this you can
VTEhYwtjTjo,1293280,1295360,opt for 900 horsepower engines which
VTEhYwtjTjo,1295360,1296720,begs the obvious question if you're
VTEhYwtjTjo,1296720,1298720,buying a boat like this for x million
VTEhYwtjTjo,1298720,1300960,pounds why on earth would you have the
VTEhYwtjTjo,1300960,1302960,slightly less powerful engines
VTEhYwtjTjo,1302960,1304799,i bet they'll never sell them if there's
VTEhYwtjTjo,1304799,1306000,in there but they'll go out with these
VTEhYwtjTjo,1306000,1308799,and would be my guess perhaps
VTEhYwtjTjo,1308799,1310400,what else can i show you in here sea
VTEhYwtjTjo,1310400,1311440,keeper
VTEhYwtjTjo,1311440,1312880,this has got a sea keeper uh
VTEhYwtjTjo,1312880,1314640,stabilization system what this is and in
VTEhYwtjTjo,1314640,1315679,fact it's worth looking these up they're
VTEhYwtjTjo,1315679,1317760,fascinating it's a gyro stabilizer
VTEhYwtjTjo,1317760,1319120,there's a gyro in there spins at a
VTEhYwtjTjo,1319120,1322159,colossal speed in a vacuum
VTEhYwtjTjo,1322159,1323520,and then because
VTEhYwtjTjo,1323520,1325760,you have a gyroscopic force then holding
VTEhYwtjTjo,1325760,1327120,uh holding itself upright you've got
VTEhYwtjTjo,1327120,1328400,something to push against
VTEhYwtjTjo,1328400,1330480,and it then uses hydraulics to then as
VTEhYwtjTjo,1330480,1331919,the boat starts to heal one more rock
VTEhYwtjTjo,1331919,1333039,one way or the other it pushes back
VTEhYwtjTjo,1333039,1334559,against it holds the boat level
VTEhYwtjTjo,1334559,1337600,generator that's up in there as well and
VTEhYwtjTjo,1337600,1340880,then other various engineering systems
VTEhYwtjTjo,1340880,1341919,plumbing
VTEhYwtjTjo,1341919,1344000,um these are the
VTEhYwtjTjo,1344000,1346400,raw water intakes for the engines for
VTEhYwtjTjo,1346400,1347520,example
VTEhYwtjTjo,1347520,1349679,and so forth let's come back down here
VTEhYwtjTjo,1349679,1351440,electronics are tucked in behind these
VTEhYwtjTjo,1351440,1353280,fellas so circuit breakers that kind of
VTEhYwtjTjo,1353280,1355600,stuff
VTEhYwtjTjo,1356000,1357520,that's under there they're quite low
VTEhYwtjTjo,1357520,1359600,over here they always are because that's
VTEhYwtjTjo,1359600,1361280,your tender gouge so that's your choice
VTEhYwtjTjo,1361280,1362880,have a tender garage don't get so much
VTEhYwtjTjo,1362880,1364640,height over the engines but you can get
VTEhYwtjTjo,1364640,1365840,right the way around them which is
VTEhYwtjTjo,1365840,1368320,excellent and down in between them
VTEhYwtjTjo,1368320,1370240,and then they put things like
VTEhYwtjTjo,1370240,1373039,filters over on this side
VTEhYwtjTjo,1373039,1374400,where you can get them easily so that's
VTEhYwtjTjo,1374400,1376720,a nice idea as well there's even a
VTEhYwtjTjo,1376720,1379360,little camera that little fella
VTEhYwtjTjo,1379360,1380480,there
VTEhYwtjTjo,1380480,1381679,that's a little camera so you keep an
VTEhYwtjTjo,1381679,1383919,eye on this when you're underway
VTEhYwtjTjo,1383919,1385679,from the um from the multi-function
VTEhYwtjTjo,1385679,1388679,displays
VTEhYwtjTjo,1388960,1390480,cool boat though isn't it i'm rather
VTEhYwtjTjo,1390480,1392559,taken to this let's come back about
VTEhYwtjTjo,1392559,1395760,and we'll go this way
VTEhYwtjTjo,1396240,1398960,oh look at this sunset can
VTEhYwtjTjo,1398960,1402000,how nice
VTEhYwtjTjo,1402000,1405520,right let's drop that one back down
VTEhYwtjTjo,1405520,1406960,spinning across
VTEhYwtjTjo,1406960,1408480,and i think we'll sit up here with
VTEhYwtjTjo,1408480,1410400,maggie
VTEhYwtjTjo,1410400,1412400,and we will say huge thank you to
VTEhYwtjTjo,1412400,1414320,sunseeker for organizing that tour for
VTEhYwtjTjo,1414320,1416240,me really appreciate it let me know what
VTEhYwtjTjo,1416240,1417120,you think of this one i think it's an
VTEhYwtjTjo,1417120,1419039,intriguing boat and i'd be interested in
VTEhYwtjTjo,1419039,1421120,your comments and we will look forward
VTEhYwtjTjo,1421120,1422559,to catching on another one of these very
VTEhYwtjTjo,1422559,1426679,soon take care bye
VTEhYwtjTjo,1430640,1432720,you
