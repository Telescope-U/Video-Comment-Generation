SV_4M9R8Ggs,4319,6879,on the 24th of february just hours after
SV_4M9R8Ggs,6879,9599,russia invaded ukraine the united states
SV_4M9R8Ggs,9599,11599,white house published their first round
SV_4M9R8Ggs,11599,13759,of sanctions saying that they will quote
SV_4M9R8Ggs,13759,15519,cut off more than half of russia's
SV_4M9R8Ggs,15519,17520,high-tech imports restricting russia's
SV_4M9R8Ggs,17520,19920,access to vital technological inputs
SV_4M9R8Ggs,19920,22000,atrophying its industrial base and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,22000,23600,undercutting russia's strategic
SV_4M9R8Ggs,23600,25599,ambitions to exert influence on the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,25599,28480,world stage and that was a huge
SV_4M9R8Ggs,28480,31039,understatement for what happened next as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,31039,32880,the aggression in ukraine intensified
SV_4M9R8Ggs,32880,35200,and it became clear that citizens around
SV_4M9R8Ggs,35200,37120,the world were outraged by russia's
SV_4M9R8Ggs,37120,38559,actions governments and private
SV_4M9R8Ggs,38559,40719,companies one after another started
SV_4M9R8Ggs,40719,43200,piling on and ended up announcing a set
SV_4M9R8Ggs,43200,45600,of blows so hard that if they were
SV_4M9R8Ggs,45600,47360,maintained they will almost certainly
SV_4M9R8Ggs,47360,49440,cause the complete collapse of russia's
SV_4M9R8Ggs,49440,52000,economy on short notice and will set the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,52000,54640,country's technological progress back by
SV_4M9R8Ggs,54640,56480,decades in this video i'll take a look
SV_4M9R8Ggs,56480,58399,at those sanctions and their impact with
SV_4M9R8Ggs,58399,60960,a special focus on technology and in a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,60960,62800,separate full-length video i'll break
SV_4M9R8Ggs,62800,65040,down how russia uses technology to fight
SV_4M9R8Ggs,65040,67439,its war from cyber attacks to damaging
SV_4M9R8Ggs,67439,69920,communication infrastructure in ukraine
SV_4M9R8Ggs,69920,71840,that second video will be exclusive to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,71840,74240,nebula and i will donate 2 000 euros
SV_4M9R8Ggs,74240,76159,from the proceeds to the ukrainian red
SV_4M9R8Ggs,76159,78080,cross so if you want to support their
SV_4M9R8Ggs,78080,79840,work and get extra content please
SV_4M9R8Ggs,79840,81680,consider subscribing for the curiosity
SV_4M9R8Ggs,81680,83439,stream nebula bundle and watching the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,83439,85520,video there with more instructions at
SV_4M9R8Ggs,85520,86900,the end of this video
SV_4M9R8Ggs,86900,92079,[Music]
SV_4M9R8Ggs,92079,93360,you have probably heard of sanctions
SV_4M9R8Ggs,93360,95280,targeting putin and the people close to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,95280,97439,him by now such as the seizures of their
SV_4M9R8Ggs,97439,99680,yachts for example but of course the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,99680,101600,much more pressing issues for the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,101600,103920,russian economy were those that target
SV_4M9R8Ggs,103920,106479,their access to technological inputs in
SV_4M9R8Ggs,106479,108880,the global financial system in terms of
SV_4M9R8Ggs,108880,111119,technology the initial round of u.s
SV_4M9R8Ggs,111119,113600,sanctions fell into two groups first
SV_4M9R8Ggs,113600,115680,they singled out state-owned entities
SV_4M9R8Ggs,115680,118240,and military end users who were put in a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,118240,120719,complete black box no imports for
SV_4M9R8Ggs,120719,123280,components no software no services no
SV_4M9R8Ggs,123280,125920,financing no repair manuals nothing they
SV_4M9R8Ggs,125920,127439,are not allowed to receive anything made
SV_4M9R8Ggs,127439,130319,by us companies or with u.s tech without
SV_4M9R8Ggs,130319,132640,express approval and second even
SV_4M9R8Ggs,132640,135040,non-military end users were still barred
SV_4M9R8Ggs,135040,137120,from key technologies such as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,137120,139040,semiconductors telecommunication
SV_4M9R8Ggs,139040,141120,encryption security lasers sensors
SV_4M9R8Ggs,141120,143200,navigation avionics and maritime
SV_4M9R8Ggs,143200,145440,technologies other countries from the eu
SV_4M9R8Ggs,145440,147920,to japan and south korea all imposed
SV_4M9R8Ggs,147920,149760,similar sanctions of their own but
SV_4M9R8Ggs,149760,151599,initially governments tried to soften
SV_4M9R8Ggs,151599,154000,the blow on their own key companies
SV_4M9R8Ggs,154000,156080,koreans for example successfully lobbied
SV_4M9R8Ggs,156080,158000,to keep smartphone exports flowing to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,158000,160319,russia as samsung is the market leader
SV_4M9R8Ggs,160319,162239,in the country italian prime minister
SV_4M9R8Ggs,162239,164640,mario draghi reportedly lobbied to keep
SV_4M9R8Ggs,164640,166959,luxury goods off the sanctions lists and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,166959,168800,energy exports from russia were
SV_4M9R8Ggs,168800,170720,completely untouched to avoid any
SV_4M9R8Ggs,170720,173280,disruptions especially in europe but
SV_4M9R8Ggs,173280,176000,upon seeing russia's increased brutality
SV_4M9R8Ggs,176000,179200,and the outrage of voters and consumers
SV_4M9R8Ggs,179200,181920,around the world the tide quickly turned
SV_4M9R8Ggs,181920,183760,and even private companies such as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,183760,185920,samsung and prada who had successfully
SV_4M9R8Ggs,185920,188480,avoided legally binding export sanctions
SV_4M9R8Ggs,188480,190400,previously decided it was probably
SV_4M9R8Ggs,190400,192400,better pr to just stop their business
SV_4M9R8Ggs,192400,194480,with russia anyway even many energy
SV_4M9R8Ggs,194480,196959,buyers who were afraid of pr blowbacks
SV_4M9R8Ggs,196959,198959,and further sanctions decided to just
SV_4M9R8Ggs,198959,201280,pause their purchases just in case and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,201280,203280,as more and more companies in the supply
SV_4M9R8Ggs,203280,205599,chain pulled out such as shipping giants
SV_4M9R8Ggs,205599,208159,merck fedex and dhl companies like
SV_4M9R8Ggs,208159,210319,carmaker renault simply found themselves
SV_4M9R8Ggs,210319,212640,unable to operate in the country at all
SV_4M9R8Ggs,212640,215040,and so they halted production as well
SV_4M9R8Ggs,215040,217120,the list of tech companies pulling out
SV_4M9R8Ggs,217120,219760,is particularly devastating it includes
SV_4M9R8Ggs,219760,222239,boeing and airbus who cut off not only
SV_4M9R8Ggs,222239,224640,new sales but also shipments of spare
SV_4M9R8Ggs,224640,226959,parts and repair support without which
SV_4M9R8Ggs,226959,228799,experts say that some airplanes will
SV_4M9R8Ggs,228799,230799,start being unable to operate within
SV_4M9R8Ggs,230799,233519,weeks to months it includes amadeus and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,233519,235599,sabre the world's two leading airline
SV_4M9R8Ggs,235599,237519,ticket booking software companies whose
SV_4M9R8Ggs,237519,239680,systems russian companies like aeroflot
SV_4M9R8Ggs,239680,241599,used to run their airlines and it
SV_4M9R8Ggs,241599,243439,includes the foreign companies that own
SV_4M9R8Ggs,243439,247120,and lease about 515 of russia's 980
SV_4M9R8Ggs,247120,249280,passenger airplanes to russian airlines
SV_4M9R8Ggs,249280,251360,meaning that legally speaking more than
SV_4M9R8Ggs,251360,253439,half of the russian fleet will have to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,253439,255519,be returned to their owners abroad
SV_4M9R8Ggs,255519,258079,before the end of the month in the car
SV_4M9R8Ggs,258079,259759,and truck industry it includes just
SV_4M9R8Ggs,259759,262320,about every major brand such as volvo
SV_4M9R8Ggs,262320,264720,and daimler trucks and the passenger car
SV_4M9R8Ggs,264720,267440,businesses from volkswagen 4 toyota and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,267440,269840,renault which have all limited or fully
SV_4M9R8Ggs,269840,271919,shut down both sales and production in
SV_4M9R8Ggs,271919,274400,the country and as a staggering side
SV_4M9R8Ggs,274400,278000,note 95 of car parts in russia are
SV_4M9R8Ggs,278000,280240,imported from abroad so without the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,280240,282400,likes of merck they simply have no
SV_4M9R8Ggs,282400,284479,choice but to do so in the consumer
SV_4M9R8Ggs,284479,286320,electronic space the list includes the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,286320,289360,likes of apple samsung dell and hp which
SV_4M9R8Ggs,289360,291040,have all partially or completely
SV_4M9R8Ggs,291040,292960,suspended their business in russia in
SV_4M9R8Ggs,292960,295199,the enterprise space oracle sap and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,295199,297199,microsoft have stopped all of their new
SV_4M9R8Ggs,297199,299360,sales and are limiting support as the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,299360,301440,three largest providers of enterprise
SV_4M9R8Ggs,301440,303280,software in the world that provide
SV_4M9R8Ggs,303280,304800,everything from database management
SV_4M9R8Ggs,304800,306639,software to inventory and human
SV_4M9R8Ggs,306639,308720,resources tools in the payment space
SV_4M9R8Ggs,308720,310800,paypal has completely stopped services
SV_4M9R8Ggs,310800,313039,in the country while mastercard visa
SV_4M9R8Ggs,313039,315120,apple pay and google pay are severely
SV_4M9R8Ggs,315120,317759,limited and the list goes on for a very
SV_4M9R8Ggs,317759,320000,very long time still this means that
SV_4M9R8Ggs,320000,322400,overnight many industries in russia are
SV_4M9R8Ggs,322400,325759,basically just gone disappeared and many
SV_4M9R8Ggs,325759,327600,others the ones that actually remain
SV_4M9R8Ggs,327600,330080,they'll have to retool their entire tax
SV_4M9R8Ggs,330080,332320,tag from office software to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,332320,334560,payment processing software to the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,334560,337120,delivery vans that they use everything
SV_4M9R8Ggs,337120,339039,all at once according to bloomberg
SV_4M9R8Ggs,339039,340960,around 3 million people work directly
SV_4M9R8Ggs,340960,342880,for foreign companies or companies that
SV_4M9R8Ggs,342880,345120,have foreign joint ventures these people
SV_4M9R8Ggs,345120,346880,are at high risk of losing their jobs
SV_4M9R8Ggs,346880,348880,basically overnight and the pull out
SV_4M9R8Ggs,348880,350880,would massively hurt local businesses as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,350880,353039,well either because local companies are
SV_4M9R8Ggs,353039,354720,suppliers of the international
SV_4M9R8Ggs,354720,356800,businesses that are now pulling out or
SV_4M9R8Ggs,356800,358400,because foreign companies are also
SV_4M9R8Ggs,358400,360319,starting to divest their shares in
SV_4M9R8Ggs,360319,362319,russian joint ventures taking their
SV_4M9R8Ggs,362319,364560,expertise and capital with them like
SV_4M9R8Ggs,364560,367039,mercedes from a local truck maker shell
SV_4M9R8Ggs,367039,369600,and bp from local energy companies etc
SV_4M9R8Ggs,369600,371600,or of course because almost every
SV_4M9R8Ggs,371600,374560,high-tech company even in russia relies
SV_4M9R8Ggs,374560,376800,heavily on foreign inputs industrial
SV_4M9R8Ggs,376800,378960,robots from germany factory automation
SV_4M9R8Ggs,378960,381360,solutions from the us and japan i mean
SV_4M9R8Ggs,381360,384000,even russian energy companies need a ton
SV_4M9R8Ggs,384000,386080,of foreign machines and software to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,386080,389360,extract and refine oil and gas and as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,389360,391520,companies pull out one by one it's
SV_4M9R8Ggs,391520,393440,questionable what russian companies will
SV_4M9R8Ggs,393440,396400,be able to operate at all going forward
SV_4M9R8Ggs,396400,397840,and next let's talk about everyone's
SV_4M9R8Ggs,397840,400000,favorite topic high-end chips which
SV_4M9R8Ggs,400000,402240,russia has been completely cut off from
SV_4M9R8Ggs,402240,404639,for everything except for consumer grade
SV_4M9R8Ggs,404639,407280,stuff and to put it bluntly things are
SV_4M9R8Ggs,407280,410240,not looking great for russia here either
SV_4M9R8Ggs,410240,412080,first intel and amd have announced that
SV_4M9R8Ggs,412080,413919,they have stopped all shipments to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,413919,416319,russia and belarus which includes both
SV_4M9R8Ggs,416319,419280,server and pc chips full stop that means
SV_4M9R8Ggs,419280,422000,no gaming pcs no server capacity
SV_4M9R8Ggs,422000,424160,expansion for cloud companies no
SV_4M9R8Ggs,424160,426639,supercomputers for the military or any
SV_4M9R8Ggs,426639,429440,other use etc the largest supercomputer
SV_4M9R8Ggs,429440,431520,in russia by the way was built by spare
SV_4M9R8Ggs,431520,433520,bank a couple of years ago using nvidia
SV_4M9R8Ggs,433520,435919,gpus which of course would be sanctioned
SV_4M9R8Ggs,435919,438479,as well second nokia and ericsson have
SV_4M9R8Ggs,438479,440720,both halted sales of network equipment
SV_4M9R8Ggs,440720,442720,to russia as well and while huawei and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,442720,445120,zte haven't made any announcements yet
SV_4M9R8Ggs,445120,446800,they theoretically won't be allowed to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,446800,449039,ship any high-end equipment to russia
SV_4M9R8Ggs,449039,451520,made with sanctioned tech such as asml
SV_4M9R8Ggs,451520,453840,machines either unless they themselves
SV_4M9R8Ggs,453840,455840,are willing to risk further sanctions as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,455840,458000,well the exact impact is a little hard
SV_4M9R8Ggs,458000,460240,to predict but the best case scenario is
SV_4M9R8Ggs,460240,462400,that russian mobile operators will have
SV_4M9R8Ggs,462400,464479,to spend billions of dollars to change
SV_4M9R8Ggs,464479,466879,their existing equipment and start
SV_4M9R8Ggs,466879,470000,buying new stuff from chinese vendors
SV_4M9R8Ggs,470000,472400,and the worst case scenario is that even
SV_4M9R8Ggs,472400,474639,those vendors will simply refuse to sell
SV_4M9R8Ggs,474639,477520,them anything high-end now russia is not
SV_4M9R8Ggs,477520,479840,a major direct consumer of chips
SV_4M9R8Ggs,479840,481680,according to the semiconductor industry
SV_4M9R8Ggs,481680,483599,association the country accounted for
SV_4M9R8Ggs,483599,486800,less than 0.1 percent of global chip
SV_4M9R8Ggs,486800,488560,purchases because the country mostly
SV_4M9R8Ggs,488560,490400,buys ready-made electronics from a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,490400,493039,brought instead and theoretically for
SV_4M9R8Ggs,493039,495599,consumer use a person could still get
SV_4M9R8Ggs,495599,498800,say an intel chip in a huawei laptop or
SV_4M9R8Ggs,498800,500960,a qualcomm chip and a xiaomi phone but
SV_4M9R8Ggs,500960,502960,anything more complicated than that and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,502960,504960,especially any custom chips that they
SV_4M9R8Ggs,504960,507599,need say for military use for example
SV_4M9R8Ggs,507599,509680,are basically off the table i've left a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,509680,511280,link to a fantastic video from the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,511280,513440,agenometry channel that goes into detail
SV_4M9R8Ggs,513440,515279,about russia's semiconductor
SV_4M9R8Ggs,515279,517919,manufacturing capabilities but the short
SV_4M9R8Ggs,517919,520080,of it is that they basically have no
SV_4M9R8Ggs,520080,522959,real capabilities russia's most advanced
SV_4M9R8Ggs,522959,526080,fabs can barely produce 65 nanometer
SV_4M9R8Ggs,526080,528959,chips which is nowhere near cutting edge
SV_4M9R8Ggs,528959,531279,and only in relatively small quantities
SV_4M9R8Ggs,531279,533360,their chips are primarily used for
SV_4M9R8Ggs,533360,535680,simple tasks such as powering chip cards
SV_4M9R8Ggs,535680,537519,for payments and the country's two
SV_4M9R8Ggs,537519,539600,somewhat competent chip design companies
SV_4M9R8Ggs,539600,542320,used taiwanese tsmc as a manufacturing
SV_4M9R8Ggs,542320,544399,partner who has announced that you've
SV_4M9R8Ggs,544399,546720,guessed it they are dropping russia too
SV_4M9R8Ggs,546720,548880,and we also know that at least one of
SV_4M9R8Ggs,548880,550560,those two companies uses foreign
SV_4M9R8Ggs,550560,552480,software for designing their chips as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,552480,554640,well for which there are no easy
SV_4M9R8Ggs,554640,556800,replacements even military drones
SV_4M9R8Ggs,556800,558800,captured in ukraine were found to be
SV_4M9R8Ggs,558800,560560,full of foreign parts including
SV_4M9R8Ggs,560560,562720,everything from camera sensors to motors
SV_4M9R8Ggs,562720,564240,and while russia has claimed to have
SV_4M9R8Ggs,564240,566240,switched over to more domestic parts in
SV_4M9R8Ggs,566240,567920,recent years there is no way that
SV_4M9R8Ggs,567920,570000,they've made close to a full transition
SV_4M9R8Ggs,570000,572160,yet and if you were wondering if china
SV_4M9R8Ggs,572160,574560,could just shift to china for advanced
SV_4M9R8Ggs,574560,576800,chips and components instead the answer
SV_4M9R8Ggs,576800,579120,is not really because even the best
SV_4M9R8Ggs,579120,581680,chinese fabs like smic can only really
SV_4M9R8Ggs,581680,583440,make advanced chips with foreign
SV_4M9R8Ggs,583440,585680,machines and if they export those to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,585680,587600,russia and get caught they themselves
SV_4M9R8Ggs,587600,589600,will land on sanctions lists as well
SV_4M9R8Ggs,589600,591760,which would completely them as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,591760,594399,well so no i don't think they can in
SV_4M9R8Ggs,594399,596800,other words except for random consumer
SV_4M9R8Ggs,596800,599040,items like smartphones for example
SV_4M9R8Ggs,599040,601680,russia basically has as many chips as it
SV_4M9R8Ggs,601680,604720,has in its stockpiles and then it's over
SV_4M9R8Ggs,604720,606399,they can't really get any more at least
SV_4M9R8Ggs,606399,608320,not high-end ones and the thing is that
SV_4M9R8Ggs,608320,610320,the russian economy really did not
SV_4M9R8Ggs,610320,612399,prepare itself for sanctions anywhere
SV_4M9R8Ggs,612399,615120,near this severe sure russian businesses
SV_4M9R8Ggs,615120,616959,and governments were on a bit of an
SV_4M9R8Ggs,616959,619360,alert since the crimean invasion where
SV_4M9R8Ggs,619360,621200,they received their first round of
SV_4M9R8Ggs,621200,622880,sanctions so they slowly started to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,622880,625200,reorient their economy and supply chains
SV_4M9R8Ggs,625200,627519,to domestic and chinese inputs but
SV_4M9R8Ggs,627519,629680,because putin insisted to the last
SV_4M9R8Ggs,629680,631760,moment and apparently even to his own
SV_4M9R8Ggs,631760,634079,government that he will not in fact
SV_4M9R8Ggs,634079,636399,invade ukraine there was no reason for
SV_4M9R8Ggs,636399,638399,any sort of strategic stockpiles or
SV_4M9R8Ggs,638399,640560,major contingency plans to be built by
SV_4M9R8Ggs,640560,643040,private businesses sure putin himself
SV_4M9R8Ggs,643040,644880,strategically increased the central
SV_4M9R8Ggs,644880,647399,bank's foreign reserves to a staggering
SV_4M9R8Ggs,647399,651200,643 billion us dollars as his war chest
SV_4M9R8Ggs,651200,653600,but two-thirds of even that pile was
SV_4M9R8Ggs,653600,656160,basically parked abroad and simply
SV_4M9R8Ggs,656160,658320,frozen through the sanctions nobody
SV_4M9R8Ggs,658320,660480,including putin saw this coming and the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,660480,662800,point here is that sanctioning any one
SV_4M9R8Ggs,662800,665600,industry in isolation such as chips or
SV_4M9R8Ggs,665600,667839,aviation or cars would be difficult
SV_4M9R8Ggs,667839,669680,enough to deal with on its own but would
SV_4M9R8Ggs,669680,672000,likely be survivable especially with the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,672000,674160,help from china but every part of the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,674160,676640,russian economy has just received major
SV_4M9R8Ggs,676640,678720,damage and there is no way that they can
SV_4M9R8Ggs,678720,681360,pivot everything all at once in my
SV_4M9R8Ggs,681360,683040,reading these sanctions combined with
SV_4M9R8Ggs,683040,685279,the voluntary pullouts from all these
SV_4M9R8Ggs,685279,687040,companies as well as the supply chain
SV_4M9R8Ggs,687040,689040,disruptions that caused even more
SV_4M9R8Ggs,689040,691760,carnage they're simply not survivable on
SV_4M9R8Ggs,691760,694000,the long term especially when russia is
SV_4M9R8Ggs,694000,696800,also simultaneously running out of money
SV_4M9R8Ggs,696800,698320,we've all heard that the ruble is
SV_4M9R8Ggs,698320,700079,collapsing now but what you might not
SV_4M9R8Ggs,700079,702000,have known is that the ruble has lost
SV_4M9R8Ggs,702000,704560,almost 80 percent of its value since
SV_4M9R8Ggs,704560,707279,2008 first through the financial crisis
SV_4M9R8Ggs,707279,709760,then after russia's invasion of crimea
SV_4M9R8Ggs,709760,711680,and now its invasion of the rest of the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,711680,713920,ukraine and the only reason it hasn't
SV_4M9R8Ggs,713920,716079,lost more of its value is because the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,716079,718320,russian central bank has increased its
SV_4M9R8Ggs,718320,721360,interest rate to an insane 20 percent
SV_4M9R8Ggs,721360,724800,commercial banks now offer people 21
SV_4M9R8Ggs,724800,726800,yearly interest rates just to convince
SV_4M9R8Ggs,726800,728959,them to not take the rubles out of their
SV_4M9R8Ggs,728959,731360,banks to avoid collapses the high
SV_4M9R8Ggs,731360,733120,interest rates then have to be passed on
SV_4M9R8Ggs,733120,735040,to businesses as well of course so
SV_4M9R8Ggs,735040,737040,borrowing money became insanely
SV_4M9R8Ggs,737040,738800,expensive for them these companies can
SV_4M9R8Ggs,738800,740720,of course also not raise money on the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,740720,743040,stock exchange either because a it's
SV_4M9R8Ggs,743040,745279,closed half the time and b their
SV_4M9R8Ggs,745279,747680,valuations are in a free fall even china
SV_4M9R8Ggs,747680,749680,has basically halted or slowed down
SV_4M9R8Ggs,749680,751920,loans to russian entities due to fears
SV_4M9R8Ggs,751920,753680,of a russian financial collapse
SV_4M9R8Ggs,753680,755760,affecting their banking sector and of
SV_4M9R8Ggs,755760,757680,course the russian government can't bail
SV_4M9R8Ggs,757680,759760,their companies out either because
SV_4M9R8Ggs,759760,761600,two-thirds of its assets are frozen
SV_4M9R8Ggs,761600,763839,abroad and the rest is spent on a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,763839,766079,disastrous war i couldn't find any
SV_4M9R8Ggs,766079,768160,definitive answers to when the russian
SV_4M9R8Ggs,768160,770399,government will run out of cash but most
SV_4M9R8Ggs,770399,772240,people on the internet that i could find
SV_4M9R8Ggs,772240,773839,seem to believe that it's somewhere in
SV_4M9R8Ggs,773839,777040,the range of a few weeks to a few months
SV_4M9R8Ggs,777040,779920,which is insane when they just started a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,779920,781519,war and it means that both the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,781519,784320,government and the companies are all out
SV_4M9R8Ggs,784320,786079,of cash or at least running out of cash
SV_4M9R8Ggs,786079,788720,soon when they need it the most now the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,788720,790800,big question with all of these sanctions
SV_4M9R8Ggs,790800,793040,is time will the russian economy
SV_4M9R8Ggs,793040,795040,collapse before the ukrainian defenses
SV_4M9R8Ggs,795040,796800,are overwhelmed will the international
SV_4M9R8Ggs,796800,798639,businesses that moved out to maintain
SV_4M9R8Ggs,798639,800560,their position over time or will they
SV_4M9R8Ggs,800560,802240,quietly go back to doing business in
SV_4M9R8Ggs,802240,804079,russia in the background after a few
SV_4M9R8Ggs,804079,807440,weeks etc and we have no clear answers
SV_4M9R8Ggs,807440,809680,here we see that shell for example first
SV_4M9R8Ggs,809680,810959,announced that it would pull out of
SV_4M9R8Ggs,810959,813120,russia but then quietly bought oil
SV_4M9R8Ggs,813120,815120,anyway when the prices dropped low
SV_4M9R8Ggs,815120,817360,enough for its greed to kick in but tech
SV_4M9R8Ggs,817360,819839,companies are actually in a relatively
SV_4M9R8Ggs,819839,822480,good spot to hold out while russia is
SV_4M9R8Ggs,822480,824800,heavily reliant on foreign tech most
SV_4M9R8Ggs,824800,827040,foreign tech companies view russia as a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,827040,829680,relatively minor market making up only a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,829680,832000,few percent of their global revenues
SV_4M9R8Ggs,832000,833760,with the entire russian economy
SV_4M9R8Ggs,833760,836320,collapsing anyway that share is only
SV_4M9R8Ggs,836320,838240,likely to shrink further and with the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,838240,840320,component shortages all over the world
SV_4M9R8Ggs,840320,842399,most tech companies can likely just find
SV_4M9R8Ggs,842399,844320,buyers for much of their russian stock
SV_4M9R8Ggs,844320,847120,abroad in other words i don't expect any
SV_4M9R8Ggs,847120,849199,major reversals until there is a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,849199,852079,ceasefire at least and instead i expect
SV_4M9R8Ggs,852079,854079,a massive brain drain to start as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,854079,856560,wealthy and educated russians first lose
SV_4M9R8Ggs,856560,859199,their jobs and then start moving abroad
SV_4M9R8Ggs,859199,861760,now many have also claimed that this
SV_4M9R8Ggs,861760,864399,situation is somehow a major opportunity
SV_4M9R8Ggs,864399,866560,for russia to pivot away from western
SV_4M9R8Ggs,866560,868480,technologies and while we can already
SV_4M9R8Ggs,868480,870880,see that in action to some degree with
SV_4M9R8Ggs,870880,872959,banks scrambling to replace visa and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,872959,875040,mastercard by chinese unionpay for
SV_4M9R8Ggs,875040,877360,example the world is just so globalized
SV_4M9R8Ggs,877360,879440,that many high-end industries simply
SV_4M9R8Ggs,879440,881360,cannot exist without international
SV_4M9R8Ggs,881360,883519,inputs transitions where possible would
SV_4M9R8Ggs,883519,885920,often take years if not decades and
SV_4M9R8Ggs,885920,888240,russia of course would also hate to
SV_4M9R8Ggs,888240,890639,simply become a technological vessel of
SV_4M9R8Ggs,890639,892959,china as well especially when china
SV_4M9R8Ggs,892959,894480,might not be willing to take on the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,894480,896480,collateral damage for supporting a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,896480,898399,russia that has failed both in its
SV_4M9R8Ggs,898399,900959,economy and military and has very little
SV_4M9R8Ggs,900959,903360,left to give in return anyway in other
SV_4M9R8Ggs,903360,905360,words if these sanctions continue there
SV_4M9R8Ggs,905360,907839,will be no economy left to support the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,907839,910560,russian military russian technological
SV_4M9R8Ggs,910560,913040,progress will be thrown back by years if
SV_4M9R8Ggs,913040,916079,not decades across the board and in just
SV_4M9R8Ggs,916079,918480,a couple of weeks or maybe months the
SV_4M9R8Ggs,918480,921040,vultures will start circling and they
SV_4M9R8Ggs,921040,923600,will start picking off every interesting
SV_4M9R8Ggs,923600,926399,russian asset every interesting russian
SV_4M9R8Ggs,926399,928880,employee oil fields anything that they
SV_4M9R8Ggs,928880,930720,can get their hands on and they'll start
SV_4M9R8Ggs,930720,932800,transporting that out of the country as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,932800,933920,well
SV_4M9R8Ggs,933920,937120,i cannot believe that putin started a
SV_4M9R8Ggs,937120,940480,war expecting any sanctions anywhere
SV_4M9R8Ggs,940480,943759,near this scale now of course the war
SV_4M9R8Ggs,943759,946320,also has technological implications on
SV_4M9R8Ggs,946320,948480,the ukrainian side i've made a full
SV_4M9R8Ggs,948480,950560,length video discussing russia's cyber
SV_4M9R8Ggs,950560,952720,warfare against ukraine and the damage
SV_4M9R8Ggs,952720,954320,it has done to things like ukrainian
SV_4M9R8Ggs,954320,956160,communication infrastructure as well as
SV_4M9R8Ggs,956160,958079,what the defenders are doing to fight
SV_4M9R8Ggs,958079,960399,back and you can watch that exclusively
SV_4M9R8Ggs,960399,962399,on nebula i've said it before but i'll
