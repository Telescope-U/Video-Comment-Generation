7QuqVSxezgA,3199,7359,onivia league of legends highlights
7QuqVSxezgA,7359,9840,yeah one one is zero on the pick yeah
7QuqVSxezgA,9840,11120,it'll be his second time it looks like
7QuqVSxezgA,11120,13360,here
7QuqVSxezgA,13679,15360,okay
7QuqVSxezgA,15360,17279,this composition could not be more
7QuqVSxezgA,17279,18640,all-in
7QuqVSxezgA,18640,20320,dot cfg
7QuqVSxezgA,20320,22080,fights in your extra gold you can give
7QuqVSxezgA,22080,23840,can be huge but
7QuqVSxezgA,23840,25599,you know against this lane like israel
7QuqVSxezgA,25599,29119,sits so far back he can avoid you
7QuqVSxezgA,29119,30560,hungary taking
7QuqVSxezgA,30560,32320,a nice little trade here he's gonna pull
7QuqVSxezgA,32320,34399,zayus and he's got that passive ticking
7QuqVSxezgA,34399,36719,saves in a little bit of trouble now as
7QuqVSxezgA,36719,39680,the q comes in and he oh man he predicts
7QuqVSxezgA,39680,41680,the flash and he's just gonna get a solo
7QuqVSxezgA,41680,43760,kill on the saves just like that as the
7QuqVSxezgA,43760,45520,flash comes in here from kellen he's
7QuqVSxezgA,45520,46879,gonna get bone speared in though and
7QuqVSxezgA,46879,48879,duck dumb gets in front of the queue but
7QuqVSxezgA,48879,50559,it does not matter
7QuqVSxezgA,50559,52559,as that will still be enough damage to
7QuqVSxezgA,52559,54640,take down gallons experience pot duo and
7QuqVSxezgA,54640,56320,drama kelown have played together for so
7QuqVSxezgA,56320,58480,long and it's israel right and that's
7QuqVSxezgA,58480,60079,why they decide to flash for the play
7QuqVSxezgA,60079,61840,onto the karma we'll secure them to
7QuqVSxezgA,61840,63520,drake of course
7QuqVSxezgA,63520,64720,and
7QuqVSxezgA,64720,67600,you know t1 a drake up here but okay
7QuqVSxezgA,67600,68960,we're gonna see the galley old committed
7QuqVSxezgA,68960,70960,yeah but nuggery is the mordekaiser
7QuqVSxezgA,70960,73439,pulls zeus in and zeus has to flash
7QuqVSxezgA,73439,76000,while in the death realm showmaker just
7QuqVSxezgA,76000,78000,waiting for that one but he gets pulled
7QuqVSxezgA,78000,80400,in a huge taunt onto two of them and
7QuqVSxezgA,80400,83200,finally domons do come up saves in a lot
7QuqVSxezgA,83200,85200,of trouble and now dublin are the ones
7QuqVSxezgA,85200,86479,that are turning this one around the
7QuqVSxezgA,86479,89280,damage not quite there for t1
7QuqVSxezgA,89280,91040,as the pole comes in and owner's gonna
7QuqVSxezgA,91040,92640,go down that is a double kill for
7QuqVSxezgA,92640,95040,nuggery who is now three and zero on the
7QuqVSxezgA,95040,97680,mordekaiser so difficult to gain
7QuqVSxezgA,97680,100960,from the twisty bait because
7QuqVSxezgA,102720,104960,now he's got gold carded now as well
7QuqVSxezgA,104960,107119,after getting leashed trying desperately
7QuqVSxezgA,107119,109040,to stop this rift from going down take a
7QuqVSxezgA,109040,111119,look at the statement at least like a 28
7QuqVSxezgA,111119,112640,30 minute game i think best case
7QuqVSxezgA,112640,114560,scenario the fastest dom one could close
7QuqVSxezgA,114560,116240,it
7QuqVSxezgA,116240,117680,but t1
7QuqVSxezgA,117680,119200,need to keep getting objectives without
7QuqVSxezgA,119200,120640,fights because winning a fight right now
7QuqVSxezgA,120640,121520,is
7QuqVSxezgA,121520,122960,it's not on the
7QuqVSxezgA,122960,124640,table it's not on one of those twisted
7QuqVSxezgA,124640,126079,fate cards right now
7QuqVSxezgA,126079,128239,they definitely need some more time you
7QuqVSxezgA,128239,129599,can see that this rip trail is going to
7QuqVSxezgA,129599,131280,come down it's looking good to take this
7QuqVSxezgA,131280,133360,one down as another grasp is going to
7QuqVSxezgA,133360,135440,get owner and he has to flash so there
7QuqVSxezgA,135440,137760,goes your playmaking on the lease ended
7QuqVSxezgA,137760,141120,up going this way so so heavily and then
7QuqVSxezgA,141120,142959,with nuggery making an outplay top side
7QuqVSxezgA,142959,146080,against you know rookie zeus here it's
7QuqVSxezgA,146080,148000,okay let's see how this one goes might
7QuqVSxezgA,148000,149840,force the death realm to come out once
7QuqVSxezgA,149840,151680,again there it is he's getting on top of
7QuqVSxezgA,151680,153440,say you snap oh and look at the damage
7QuqVSxezgA,153440,155040,that's coming out says with a really
7QuqVSxezgA,155040,156879,nice flash in the death realm though
7QuqVSxezgA,156879,159680,it's the damage saves will win the trade
7QuqVSxezgA,159680,162720,and canyon gets faded into trying to go
7QuqVSxezgA,162720,165920,for the kill and immediately t1 finally
7QuqVSxezgA,165920,168000,gets something on their table so they
7QuqVSxezgA,168000,170640,they do in fact and you know nuggery had
7QuqVSxezgA,170640,172480,flash could have tried to pull the death
7QuqVSxezgA,172480,174640,realm closer to turret there but decided
7QuqVSxezgA,174640,176319,he was going to try to buy time for a
7QuqVSxezgA,176319,178319,rotation in showmaker has old but he's
7QuqVSxezgA,178319,181120,on the wrong side of the map does not of
7QuqVSxezgA,181120,183040,course have teleport either
7QuqVSxezgA,183040,184879,so trying to buy time there and trying
7QuqVSxezgA,184879,186720,to delay it early instead of doing that
7QuqVSxezgA,186720,188800,or ever contest
7QuqVSxezgA,188800,191440,here we go again and james has red buff
7QuqVSxezgA,191440,193680,there is the destiny that does come in
7QuqVSxezgA,193680,194480,as
7QuqVSxezgA,194480,195920,threatening it here but even the
7QuqVSxezgA,195920,197680,teleport committal they're just
7QuqVSxezgA,197680,199519,considering pushing showmaker away they
7QuqVSxezgA,199519,201920,do exactly that as the death realm does
7QuqVSxezgA,201920,203280,end and now nuggery's in a lot of
7QuqVSxezgA,203280,205360,trouble owners able to set up the kick
7QuqVSxezgA,205360,208080,flash and now the rotation from one
7QuqVSxezgA,208080,210159,looks a bit slow here comes canyon
7QuqVSxezgA,210159,212159,though looking for that pillar can he
7QuqVSxezgA,212159,213680,line it up owner looks to be the
7QuqVSxezgA,213680,216480,sacrifice as everybody else is just on
7QuqVSxezgA,216480,218799,the run and owner he's still alive
7QuqVSxezgA,218799,220319,actually he's not going to go down
7QuqVSxezgA,220319,223440,either and the kiting here is a real alt
7QuqVSxezgA,223440,226000,is subject yeah everything else is down
7QuqVSxezgA,226000,228640,obviously the mantra from uh karma a
7QuqVSxezgA,228640,230080,little bit of a special case there but
7QuqVSxezgA,230080,232159,everybody else no else someone are just
7QuqVSxezgA,232159,233760,not gonna let this go without a fight
7QuqVSxezgA,233760,235599,regardless though owner owner did get
7QuqVSxezgA,235599,237360,his right now though the flash comes in
7QuqVSxezgA,237360,239519,big taunt a huge summoner ability to
7QuqVSxezgA,239519,243280,make a duck dumb 100-0 just like that
7QuqVSxezgA,243280,246080,but now this is the t1 that we have seen
7QuqVSxezgA,246080,247920,all in the past they are taking that
7QuqVSxezgA,247920,250080,confidence with the big turnaround in
7QuqVSxezgA,250080,251439,the mid game
7QuqVSxezgA,251439,253360,faker makes the big play and they get
7QuqVSxezgA,253360,256000,the big drink i think that domwikia
7QuqVSxezgA,256000,258560,without vision control of this drake pit
7QuqVSxezgA,258560,259919,and with the without the crucial
7QuqVSxezgA,259919,261600,ultimates they need to win a fight here
7QuqVSxezgA,261600,262800,at this stage in the game should have
7QuqVSxezgA,262800,265040,been willing to give this one up because
7QuqVSxezgA,265040,267040,now you've given soul point
7QuqVSxezgA,267040,269520,and a ton of gold and a baron and they
7QuqVSxezgA,269520,271600,already had vision control on both top
7QuqVSxezgA,271600,273680,and bottom and with umbroglade like
7QuqVSxezgA,273680,275199,you're never going to get that one back
7QuqVSxezgA,275199,277520,as don juan kia basically ever and they
7QuqVSxezgA,277520,279199,have a composition that
7QuqVSxezgA,279199,281040,looks like it had no chance of coming
7QuqVSxezgA,281040,283040,back in this game but two critical top
7QuqVSxezgA,283040,285600,side plays i did the follow up on the
7QuqVSxezgA,285600,287120,the drake the set up here is good from
7QuqVSxezgA,287120,288479,faker playing around vision so
7QuqVSxezgA,288479,291360,incredibly well it locks the door it's
7QuqVSxezgA,291360,293120,okay but t1 will continue to push the
7QuqVSxezgA,293120,295759,issue here in two lanes and it looks
7QuqVSxezgA,295759,298000,like both of these turrets will fall
7QuqVSxezgA,298000,299759,and you know nuggery on the mordekaiser
7QuqVSxezgA,299759,301520,he's great in terms of playing league
7QuqVSxezgA,301520,304000,side but now that he's fallen behind now
7QuqVSxezgA,304000,306320,there's even a stopwatch on zeus he only
7QuqVSxezgA,306320,308160,needed two and a half items i guess
7QuqVSxezgA,308160,310240,because if it goes into death realm he
7QuqVSxezgA,310240,312400,can out damage the more kaiser and he's
7QuqVSxezgA,312400,313840,just gonna stop watch so he'll be
7QuqVSxezgA,313840,316560,totally fine his owner saw the chase
7QuqVSxezgA,316560,319600,you're up two levels on canyon
7QuqVSxezgA,319600,321759,it's the treadmill you know from ahead
7QuqVSxezgA,321759,324639,we saw the power but now from up behind
7QuqVSxezgA,324639,326400,certainly kind of just
7QuqVSxezgA,326400,327759,walking ward he does have those
7QuqVSxezgA,327759,330720,anatomists chains yeah let's see if he
7QuqVSxezgA,330720,331520,can
7QuqVSxezgA,331520,333280,make anything happen here zayn is just
7QuqVSxezgA,333280,334960,going to get tethered up might have to
7QuqVSxezgA,334960,336880,be left alone he is going to use his
7QuqVSxezgA,336880,338479,stompbox as well as they're looking to
7QuqVSxezgA,338479,340960,turn it around owner goes in not sure
7QuqVSxezgA,340960,342479,about that took thumbs over the wall
7QuqVSxezgA,342479,344479,just reigning hell on them but now
7QuqVSxezgA,344479,346400,goomba usually's got position good
7QuqVSxezgA,346400,349039,pillar though to block the escape as t1
7QuqVSxezgA,349039,350720,looks like they went a bit deep and now
7QuqVSxezgA,350720,353520,it's dominant's turn to try to turn this
7QuqVSxezgA,353520,354400,game
7QuqVSxezgA,354400,356720,as only two members of t1 will get out
7QuqVSxezgA,356720,359120,of there deep dive here for t1 and
7QuqVSxezgA,359120,361120,it is quite nice baker on the back side
7QuqVSxezgA,361120,362880,they're in the pit he's gonna be spotted
7QuqVSxezgA,362880,366400,baker is going for a bit of a
7QuqVSxezgA,366400,368800,windy walk as now
7QuqVSxezgA,368800,370560,under underneath everybody that's going
7QuqVSxezgA,370560,371280,to be
7QuqVSxezgA,371280,373440,in some trouble but it is zaya after all
7QuqVSxezgA,373440,376000,as the gold card comes in and the damage
7QuqVSxezgA,376000,377919,is there to kill him anyway as the
7QuqVSxezgA,377919,379600,dragon will go the way of t1 though
7QuqVSxezgA,379600,381360,they're going to pick up the soul
7QuqVSxezgA,381360,384319,as faker here nearly able to take down
7QuqVSxezgA,384319,385520,which is certainly going to help them
7QuqVSxezgA,385520,386560,out a bit
7QuqVSxezgA,386560,388880,and okay this is a bit of a scary spot
7QuqVSxezgA,388880,391440,to be in st one ooh canyon okay i
7QuqVSxezgA,391440,392400,thought there were more here never
7QuqVSxezgA,392400,395600,totally caught by himself and he is just
7QuqVSxezgA,395600,398240,dead uh yeah i actually thought the rest
7QuqVSxezgA,398240,400400,of don monkey were collapsing in faster
7QuqVSxezgA,400400,402080,i mean the idea was correct like oh we
7QuqVSxezgA,402080,403360,catch them there but the rest of the
7QuqVSxezgA,403360,406080,team isn't there and now t1
7QuqVSxezgA,406080,407600,have a free bearing
7QuqVSxezgA,407600,408960,so
7QuqVSxezgA,408960,410639,yeah look the idea was good there from
7QuqVSxezgA,410639,411599,the canyon like i don't want to
7QuqVSxezgA,411599,412720,criticize it too much because if they
7QuqVSxezgA,412720,415280,actually are faster to trap and have a
7QuqVSxezgA,415280,416720,little bit of vision control of their
7QuqVSxezgA,416720,418319,own jungle then maybe they they pull it
7QuqVSxezgA,418319,420479,off but again t1's vision has been so
7QuqVSxezgA,420479,422639,good the umbroglade really helping them
7QuqVSxezgA,422639,424960,out here in that regard and
7QuqVSxezgA,424960,426639,canyon thinks he's setting up a play but
7QuqVSxezgA,426639,428160,in fact he's the he's the one who's
7QuqVSxezgA,428160,430080,getting trapped and baited in yeah i
7QuqVSxezgA,430080,432160,think he should have just waited for his
7QuqVSxezgA,432160,434319,team to come in a bit more if he was
7QuqVSxezgA,434319,436560,gonna try to clear out some vision and
7QuqVSxezgA,436560,438720,try to scout things out maybe just
7QuqVSxezgA,438720,441039,assuming he was tanky enough of our time
7QuqVSxezgA,441039,443680,because it was a huge game he comes out
7QuqVSxezgA,443680,445360,here he's 2-0 in one even through all
7QuqVSxezgA,445360,446960,the trouble he has
7QuqVSxezgA,446960,448800,some ridiculous vision score i don't
7QuqVSxezgA,448800,450400,even know what it is at this point
7QuqVSxezgA,450400,452240,as the kick comes in i think that was a
7QuqVSxezgA,452240,454240,little bit messed up there by pat ward
7QuqVSxezgA,454240,456400,uh a very suspicious ward there he is
7QuqVSxezgA,456400,457919,going to jump on to another one zade is
7QuqVSxezgA,457919,459840,just kind of front lining us now here
7QuqVSxezgA,459840,461280,comes that engagement we were looking
7QuqVSxezgA,461280,464720,for he jumps onto canyon not necessarily
7QuqVSxezgA,464720,466960,the best target but it doesn't matter
7QuqVSxezgA,466960,469440,the damage here from one is just so
7QuqVSxezgA,469440,471280,lacking at this point in time
7QuqVSxezgA,471280,473120,everybody's just too tanky they can't
7QuqVSxezgA,473120,475120,get through it nuggery's focused down
7QuqVSxezgA,475120,476639,here he took so much damage before the
7QuqVSxezgA,476639,478240,rest of don juan kia can try to help him
7QuqVSxezgA,478240,479120,out
7QuqVSxezgA,479120,481039,and with that right now yeah they can
7QuqVSxezgA,481039,483199,just easily do this this is what this
7QuqVSxezgA,483199,484960,cop does so well and that's gonna be
7QuqVSxezgA,484960,486720,duck top dead two
7QuqVSxezgA,486720,489680,t1 are gonna put an end to this game now
7QuqVSxezgA,489680,491440,with the baron that they still have for
7QuqVSxezgA,491440,493440,50 seconds left
