BkFlRIDtzUY,67760,70240,circle in the top left for the highlight
BkFlRIDtzUY,70240,72240,and then let's color in the big circle

BkFlRIDtzUY,170160,172000,how they're kind of curving in
BkFlRIDtzUY,172000,174239,and then let's connect these two
BkFlRIDtzUY,174239,178720,fuzzy cheeks with a curve for the chin
BkFlRIDtzUY,180239,183280,it's so cute yeah i love it okay let's

BkFlRIDtzUY,186879,189280,floppy we're going to draw a curve that
BkFlRIDtzUY,189280,190800,comes out
BkFlRIDtzUY,190800,192239,and then we're going to draw a little
BkFlRIDtzUY,192239,194480,zigzag at the end so we're going to do
BkFlRIDtzUY,194480,195920,the same thing over here we'll draw a
BkFlRIDtzUY,195920,197920,little line that comes out and then

BkFlRIDtzUY,211840,213120,cheek
BkFlRIDtzUY,213120,214610,oh it's really cute
BkFlRIDtzUY,214610,215920,[Music]
BkFlRIDtzUY,215920,217599,i'm not sure what kind of dog we're
BkFlRIDtzUY,217599,219120,drawing it kind of looks like a golden
BkFlRIDtzUY,219120,221360,retriever kind of looks like a corgi but
BkFlRIDtzUY,221360,223040,these ears aren't going to get anywhere
BkFlRIDtzUY,223040,224560,yeah it could be any
BkFlRIDtzUY,224560,226239,any kind of dog that you want you could
BkFlRIDtzUY,226239,227760,even change the ears you don't have to
BkFlRIDtzUY,227760,229920,draw them exactly like us you could draw
BkFlRIDtzUY,229920,231519,them pointed
BkFlRIDtzUY,231519,233439,you could draw them even longer or you
BkFlRIDtzUY,233439,235040,could draw them just really short oh
BkFlRIDtzUY,235040,236959,that's really cute okay now let's draw
BkFlRIDtzUY,236959,239280,the cap so that it looks like our dog is
BkFlRIDtzUY,239280,241439,graduating from school so i'm gonna i'm
BkFlRIDtzUY,241439,243599,gonna start here we're gonna draw a line
BkFlRIDtzUY,243599,246000,coming up on the left and also a line
BkFlRIDtzUY,246000,249680,coming up over here on the right
BkFlRIDtzUY,251280,252239,and then
BkFlRIDtzUY,252239,254239,let's connect these two lines with a
BkFlRIDtzUY,254239,257759,curve that comes up and back down
BkFlRIDtzUY,257759,260079,and then the graduating caps look really
BkFlRIDtzUY,260079,261919,funny they got a square on top so i'm
BkFlRIDtzUY,261919,263520,going to draw a little guide point right
BkFlRIDtzUY,263520,265440,here and we'll draw a guide point over
BkFlRIDtzUY,265440,268160,here and in the same spot over here so
BkFlRIDtzUY,268160,270240,we have one on each side and then one
BkFlRIDtzUY,270240,272080,right in the middle
BkFlRIDtzUY,272080,274800,let's connect these two together
BkFlRIDtzUY,274800,277360,the point at the in the middle down to
BkFlRIDtzUY,277360,279520,the left side
BkFlRIDtzUY,279520,281360,and then let's also oh i'm going to make
BkFlRIDtzUY,281360,283040,this come up just a little higher and in
BkFlRIDtzUY,283040,284960,the middle and then we'll come down and
BkFlRIDtzUY,284960,287280,connect to the one on the right
BkFlRIDtzUY,287280,290639,we did it okay now let's connect it in
BkFlRIDtzUY,290639,292080,to
BkFlRIDtzUY,292080,293919,the middle we'll draw another diagonal
BkFlRIDtzUY,293919,296000,line coming down and another diagonal
BkFlRIDtzUY,296000,298960,line on the other side coming down
BkFlRIDtzUY,298960,300400,and then there's a little tassel that
BkFlRIDtzUY,300400,302400,comes down from the hat so we're going
BkFlRIDtzUY,302400,305360,to draw a string that comes down
BkFlRIDtzUY,305360,306880,we're going to come into the ear right
BkFlRIDtzUY,306880,308880,here
BkFlRIDtzUY,308880,313039,and then at the end let's draw a circle
BkFlRIDtzUY,313039,314560,and then next we're going to draw a
BkFlRIDtzUY,314560,316160,square shape so we could draw two lines
BkFlRIDtzUY,316160,318240,coming down from the circle
BkFlRIDtzUY,318240,320880,and then connect those at the bottom
BkFlRIDtzUY,320880,322560,and then let's draw the end of the
BkFlRIDtzUY,322560,324000,tassel we're going to draw a curve that
BkFlRIDtzUY,324000,326960,comes out and down
BkFlRIDtzUY,327120,328639,and then the same thing on the right
BkFlRIDtzUY,328639,330720,side coming out of that square out and
BkFlRIDtzUY,330720,333039,down
BkFlRIDtzUY,333520,335039,and then at the very bottom we just
BkFlRIDtzUY,335039,337199,connect them with a straight line
