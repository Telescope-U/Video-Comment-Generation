-RmUADCWI4A,8340,8960,Welcome to the
-RmUADCWI4A,8980,13879,S.A.D.P.A.S.G.B.E.T.I.B.A.L.T.
-RmUADCWI4A,14530,16460,(Garrett) There's no way that's correct!
-RmUADCWI4A,16460,19720,(Tyler) Second Annual Dude Perfect All Sports Golf Battle...
-RmUADCWI4A,19720,22000,...Even Though It's Been A Long Time!
-RmUADCWI4A,22400,24199,LET'S GO!!
-RmUADCWI4A,31020,33240,"(Garrett) Ladies and gentlemen, humpback. Man,"
-RmUADCWI4A,33300,37500,"I'm excited to be here. I got my tennis racket, I'll try to put this about 40 yards up there!"
-RmUADCWI4A,37600,40039,"I'm the reigning champ, baby. So... respect me."
-RmUADCWI4A,45760,47600,(Tyler) Going with the baseball and the bat...
-RmUADCWI4A,47820,50440,...I really hope it comes further than Garrett's tennis ball.
-RmUADCWI4A,56180,58040,(Cody) What's up guys? Team Red here.
-RmUADCWI4A,58100,61800,"Last battle, win. I did say if I don't win. I'm shaving the beard. Let's see what happens."
-RmUADCWI4A,67300,68740,"Oh fine, that's fine."
-RmUADCWI4A,68740,71820,(Coby) I'm debating between the soccer ball and the football... I'm going with the punt!
-RmUADCWI4A,73820,75100,"(Cory) Oh, lost a shoe!"
-RmUADCWI4A,76700,80520,(Cory) Team Yellow checking into the game. There's no need to talk!
-RmUADCWI4A,82000,84000,"(Voiceover) Oh, no!"
-RmUADCWI4A,85140,87320,(Coby) Are baseballs supposed to go further than tennis balls?
-RmUADCWI4A,87320,87820,(Tyler) I think so...
-RmUADCWI4A,89060,94340,"(Tyler) Alright, headed to the second shot, boys! Don't forget: once you use it, you lose it."
-RmUADCWI4A,94340,95219,(Cody laughs)
-RmUADCWI4A,97600,99600,"(Coby) It's baseball time, baby!"
-RmUADCWI4A,101200,106420,(cheering and laughter)
-RmUADCWI4A,106520,111700,(Tyler) It is about that time when I have to make an official statement. I'm leaving team Coby...
-RmUADCWI4A,112560,116040,"...and I'm officially joining, my bearded brother, Cody Jones!!"
-RmUADCWI4A,116860,118040,Team Cody and Ty!
-RmUADCWI4A,118320,119400,Let's go!
-RmUADCWI4A,127080,127740,(Cory) Let's go!
-RmUADCWI4A,127740,129080,(Cody) You forgot your bag!
-RmUADCWI4A,129899,131560,(laughter)
-RmUADCWI4A,131580,132920,"(Garrett) Going for the soccer ball here,"
-RmUADCWI4A,133120,135200,hopefully I do better than the last video...
-RmUADCWI4A,137580,138400,"(Voiceover) ""Wait, where did it go?"""
-RmUADCWI4A,138500,139240,...I've come a long way.
-RmUADCWI4A,149080,150840,(Coby) Soccer ball ready to go...
-RmUADCWI4A,150840,155860,"...I want you guys to remember, soccer last time was just the absolute lowest point for me..."
-RmUADCWI4A,157620,160560,(laughter)
-RmUADCWI4A,160780,162780,"...again, I don't know if it could be worse than that."
-RmUADCWI4A,166780,167760,...I'm happy with that.
-RmUADCWI4A,170680,173400,"(Garrett) Fourth hit, par-5. Yikes, I'm a long way out."
-RmUADCWI4A,190440,192440,"(Voiceover) Cory, you forgot your bag again!"
-RmUADCWI4A,194960,196400,(Voiveover) What a hit!
-RmUADCWI4A,196400,198220,(Cody) I'm gonna make sure it's not in the water.
-RmUADCWI4A,202740,203500,(Coby) Hockey time.
-RmUADCWI4A,203500,205460,(Voiceover) There's a whiff opportunity on this item.
-RmUADCWI4A,206760,208360,(laughter)
-RmUADCWI4A,210020,212300,(Coby) Sometimes you have golfing days that you want to forget.
-RmUADCWI4A,212309,213300,This is one of them.
-RmUADCWI4A,213360,217020,"Really good seeing you. I thought someone else was gonna go, but I think it's me again for obvious reasons."
-RmUADCWI4A,222380,223840,(Cory) How I thought into that looked.
-RmUADCWI4A,225840,226879,(Tyler cheering)
-RmUADCWI4A,233740,236540,"(Voiceover) Oh, wow. What a throw!!"
-RmUADCWI4A,237140,239280,"(Voiceover) I think he's got one thing left, folks."
-RmUADCWI4A,239360,241860,"(Tyler) Turns out! Coby is on his last item,"
-RmUADCWI4A,241869,246240,...he will have to reuse his items in the order he started with.
-RmUADCWI4A,246640,247480,(Coby) Can I throw the paddle?
-RmUADCWI4A,247560,248060,(Tyler) No.
-RmUADCWI4A,251840,256479,"(Tyler) Coby is technically still up, but if you turn around, you can actually still see him,"
-RmUADCWI4A,256480,258180,...I think it's best that I go ahead and go.
-RmUADCWI4A,271740,275000,"(Coby) Going for it is a terrible idea, but I'm doing it!"
-RmUADCWI4A,276280,278360,"(Voiceover) Oh, that's a water ball!"
-RmUADCWI4A,278940,279720,(Coby) That's not gonna help me.
-RmUADCWI4A,279720,284400,"(Tyler) And to save time for ourselves and the viewers we're not going to tell Coby this,"
-RmUADCWI4A,284400,287129,...but you will probably not see any more of his shots.
-RmUADCWI4A,287200,290460,He is essentially DQ'd we'll let him think he's still playing.
-RmUADCWI4A,290460,293880,"I'm gonna go for the 105 vortex throw,"
-RmUADCWI4A,293880,295800,...hopefully I hit green...
-RmUADCWI4A,295800,296699,...into the wind.
-RmUADCWI4A,296700,297640,"(Voiceover) Oh, there's no way."
-RmUADCWI4A,297700,299780,"(Tyler) This is for all you team Ty, folks. Out there."
-RmUADCWI4A,300000,301780,"Let it fly, Ty!!"
-RmUADCWI4A,302860,304860,"(Voiceover) Oh, what a throw!"
-RmUADCWI4A,306140,308140,"(Voiceover) Oh, it's in the water!"
-RmUADCWI4A,309120,311120,"(Coby) It's in the water, oh my gosh!"
-RmUADCWI4A,311140,314260,(Coby) That means we're the Splash Bros. Oh my gosh!
-RmUADCWI4A,316160,324940,"(Tyler) These are the moments that just absolutely humble you as a competitor. You know, you come out here, you're feeling good you're right where you want to be and you get a little too risky with it, and that's what happens."
-RmUADCWI4A,325200,326400,You put a ball in the water when you're feeling good.
-RmUADCWI4A,326960,328220,(Cody) Let's hope I can throw this far.
-RmUADCWI4A,343820,346480,I gave it all I had boys got I got a juice
-RmUADCWI4A,351169,354008,I have never been happier to be in a sand trap
-RmUADCWI4A,355849,361298,"Losing the shoes unfortunately the vortex didn't make it all the way across two items left, so I've got to be on the green"
-RmUADCWI4A,367850,369850,Frisbee time
-RmUADCWI4A,373240,378910,I guess for you guys. I'll get in the water. I appreciate you being a purple hoser fan
-RmUADCWI4A,384560,387070,If I want any chance of this it's got to be a good hit
-RmUADCWI4A,396139,398168,Cory just had a career shot of a lifetime
-RmUADCWI4A,398300,403599,I did not think that this was going to come down to the biggest shot of my day being with a ping-pong ball
-RmUADCWI4A,411640,413640,All right here we go
-RmUADCWI4A,420440,422270,Oh no
-RmUADCWI4A,422270,425139,"Oh no, I'm not taking my shoes off again, so"
-RmUADCWI4A,425900,427460,D
-RmUADCWI4A,427460,428690,Q
-RmUADCWI4A,428690,430719,I've got a little right-to-left slowpitch
-RmUADCWI4A,439559,441559,Here we go
-RmUADCWI4A,446100,448739,"If I make this shot, it seals the spot in the finale"
-RmUADCWI4A,453370,455370,It's the downhill putt folks
-RmUADCWI4A,459760,461760,Team gold going for gold
-RmUADCWI4A,467800,474478,"I didn't even tell you there was a whiff opportunity, but my goodness we shoot a flash tonight scream"
-RmUADCWI4A,476980,478980,That was a colossal failure
-RmUADCWI4A,482689,489738,"I was feeling the pressure, but the pressure is kind of gone. If he makes it he's in the finale"
-RmUADCWI4A,493889,501318,What was supposed to be a perfect golden hour finale has turned into about the gloomiest visual viewing pleasure you could ever have
-RmUADCWI4A,501749,503897,But we got to do it the show must go on
-RmUADCWI4A,504499,506499,So headed to the finale
-RmUADCWI4A,510899,512899,Little nerve-wracking here at the finale
-RmUADCWI4A,521189,525919,"Well I'm gonna designate myself as Cody's caddy partly for a couple reasons, I just want to be in the video"
-RmUADCWI4A,526740,529370,Second one of these colors makes purple. You know what I mean
-RmUADCWI4A,532980,537519,The only thing incentivizing the victories that I don't have to shave my beard I win it stays
-RmUADCWI4A,543160,550180,Are there three team Cody people right here team Cody team Cody and Cody technically we are all rooting for Cody pure joy
-RmUADCWI4A,550240,555720,"I'm team Cody also for codes. I didn't want to say in front of the other guys, but heck of a shot man"
-RmUADCWI4A,556300,558300,"Okay, it's time for the board texture"
-RmUADCWI4A,563620,566880,"No, I really wanted to be on the green we're guys see what cody does here"
-RmUADCWI4A,572290,577209,I feel like I gotta use something where it's got a chance to go in the hole pains me to do this folks
-RmUADCWI4A,577209,583268,"I'm gonna ask my old teammate Coby Cotton to ten the flag for me. Hey, I wish I could but you asked me earlier, so"
-RmUADCWI4A,594709,599349,"Team Cody's over here, he's got a putt to win. If he sinks this, ball game. We're going home"
-RmUADCWI4A,610060,612060,There we go
-RmUADCWI4A,615150,618769,Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the playoff hole as light is quickly fading
-RmUADCWI4A,619110,625430,We are making up the rules as usual and you've got a vortex and your putter low score wins
-RmUADCWI4A,643000,647780,He got it if I make this shot folks it is all over Cody's shavin'

-RmUADCWI4A,671970,675378,"Probably, I'm gonna keep the clubs but the bag. Oh I see"
