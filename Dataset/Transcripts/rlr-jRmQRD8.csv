rlr-jRmQRD8,80,1599,hello gorgeous peeps i'm chris from
rlr-jRmQRD8,1599,2800,texpert and today we're going to be
rlr-jRmQRD8,2800,4720,checking out one of the flashiest phones
rlr-jRmQRD8,4720,9679,of 2022 thus far the zte accent 40 ultra
rlr-jRmQRD8,9679,11840,this is a proper premium flagship
rlr-jRmQRD8,11840,13759,smartphone through and through boston
rlr-jRmQRD8,13759,16160,proper game and grunt clever camera tech
rlr-jRmQRD8,16160,19119,and also a full view display there's no
rlr-jRmQRD8,19119,21199,notch or selfie orifice here thanks to
rlr-jRmQRD8,21199,24160,zte's fresh new updated under display
rlr-jRmQRD8,24160,28480,camera tech woof the zt axon 40 ultra
rlr-jRmQRD8,28480,30800,goes on sale globally on june the 21st
rlr-jRmQRD8,30800,32640,and here's a video of me pulling it out
rlr-jRmQRD8,32640,34719,of this here box and banging on about it
rlr-jRmQRD8,34719,36160,a lot and for more on the latest and
rlr-jRmQRD8,36160,37600,greatest tech please do poke subscribe
rlr-jRmQRD8,37600,39920,and ding that notifications bell cheers
rlr-jRmQRD8,39920,41920,so first up what do you get in that
rlr-jRmQRD8,41920,44000,rather lovely box well you've got an
rlr-jRmQRD8,44000,46640,actually quite dinky power adapter 65
rlr-jRmQRD8,46640,48719,watts bundled in the box a rather
rlr-jRmQRD8,48719,51199,delightful usb c cable you've got some
rlr-jRmQRD8,51199,52719,earphones bundled in there and they are
rlr-jRmQRD8,52719,55039,actually your regular 3.5 mil efforts as
rlr-jRmQRD8,55039,56719,well which made me think oh my god the
rlr-jRmQRD8,56719,58559,zt axon 40 ultra actually has a
rlr-jRmQRD8,58559,60640,headphone jack but no don't get your
rlr-jRmQRD8,60640,62559,hopes up it's complete lies there is no
rlr-jRmQRD8,62559,64799,headphone jack on here so you're
rlr-jRmQRD8,64799,66640,basically freaking useless
rlr-jRmQRD8,66640,69119,and you got your usual prophylactic case
rlr-jRmQRD8,69119,71840,to keep the zt axon 40 ultra safe from
rlr-jRmQRD8,71840,74159,harm with a comedically huge camera cut
rlr-jRmQRD8,74159,76880,out there and that is well and truly
rlr-jRmQRD8,76880,81360,that so here we have the zte axon 40
rlr-jRmQRD8,81360,83680,ultra and it's obvious from the minute
rlr-jRmQRD8,83680,85520,you pull the wrapping off this thing
rlr-jRmQRD8,85520,87759,that it's a premium device through and
rlr-jRmQRD8,87759,90479,through just looks very very sleek 204
rlr-jRmQRD8,90479,92799,grams got a decent heft to it as well it
rlr-jRmQRD8,92799,94479,is a six point eight inches so it's
rlr-jRmQRD8,94479,96640,almost as good as some of the biggest
rlr-jRmQRD8,96640,98799,smartphones of 2022 including likes the
rlr-jRmQRD8,98799,101119,s22 ultra and like the ultra it's got
rlr-jRmQRD8,101119,103439,that curved display that just slopes off
rlr-jRmQRD8,103439,106079,around the left and right edges as well
rlr-jRmQRD8,106079,108799,and very skinny bezels above and below
rlr-jRmQRD8,108799,110799,that massive display too but of course
rlr-jRmQRD8,110799,113119,the most striking aspect of the zt axon
rlr-jRmQRD8,113119,115040,40 ultra's design is the fact that
rlr-jRmQRD8,115040,117200,you've got absolutely bugger all notch
rlr-jRmQRD8,117200,119600,or selfie orifice action up here at the
rlr-jRmQRD8,119600,122560,top end this is thanks to zte's latest
rlr-jRmQRD8,122560,125280,super snazzy upgraded under display
rlr-jRmQRD8,125280,127360,camera technology they've had a couple
rlr-jRmQRD8,127360,128879,of bashes at this before and you can
rlr-jRmQRD8,128879,130720,generally see that under display selfie
rlr-jRmQRD8,130720,133120,camera quite easily through the top
rlr-jRmQRD8,133120,134720,layers i found that especially when you
rlr-jRmQRD8,134720,136560,tilt the screen at an angle it became
rlr-jRmQRD8,136560,138160,all the more obvious but i gotta say
rlr-jRmQRD8,138160,140319,here on the axon 40 ultra they have done
rlr-jRmQRD8,140319,142879,a bang up job if you spend a very long
rlr-jRmQRD8,142879,144560,time trying different backgrounds and
rlr-jRmQRD8,144560,146560,squinting very hard and kind of shifting
rlr-jRmQRD8,146560,148480,around to different angles you can just
rlr-jRmQRD8,148480,150879,about notice it on occasion but honestly
rlr-jRmQRD8,150879,153360,this thing is very very discreet it is
rlr-jRmQRD8,153360,156400,hidden away incredibly well the zte axon
rlr-jRmQRD8,156400,158319,40 ultra is constructed from gorilla
rlr-jRmQRD8,158319,160239,glass front and back and that's
rlr-jRmQRD8,160239,162400,separated by a very slender strip of
rlr-jRmQRD8,162400,164239,metal now back end certainly doesn't
rlr-jRmQRD8,164239,166400,look or feel like glass thanks to the
rlr-jRmQRD8,166400,168480,frosted matte finish which is actually
rlr-jRmQRD8,168480,170720,really really good at repelling greasy
rlr-jRmQRD8,170720,172959,fingerprints and all kinds of muck gotta
rlr-jRmQRD8,172959,174319,see it i've been fingering it pretty
rlr-jRmQRD8,174319,176480,hard since i got it out so to speak and
rlr-jRmQRD8,176480,178560,as you can see still looks pristine i
rlr-jRmQRD8,178560,180159,have to say though that camera bump is
rlr-jRmQRD8,180159,182239,rather bloody massive at least in terms
rlr-jRmQRD8,182239,184000,of width and height it doesn't actually
rlr-jRmQRD8,184000,186159,jut too far at the back end of the axon
rlr-jRmQRD8,186159,188400,40 which is a relief and if you're
rlr-jRmQRD8,188400,189760,hoping for a selection of different
rlr-jRmQRD8,189760,191760,colors with the axon 40 ultra where you
rlr-jRmQRD8,191760,193760,might be disappointed because it comes
rlr-jRmQRD8,193760,194879,in black
rlr-jRmQRD8,194879,197440,and that's it basically not much else to
rlr-jRmQRD8,197440,199040,speak about as far as the design goes
rlr-jRmQRD8,199040,201280,you've got your ir blaster up top and a
rlr-jRmQRD8,201280,203440,speaker down below you've got another
rlr-jRmQRD8,203440,205680,speaker types the usb port and a sim
rlr-jRmQRD8,205680,208080,tray and of course no headphone jack
rlr-jRmQRD8,208080,209840,so on the software side of things what
rlr-jRmQRD8,209840,211440,you've got here is of course android 12
rlr-jRmQRD8,211440,213680,as you would hope for and also the my
rlr-jRmQRD8,213680,216560,ios 12 launcher is squatting on top of
rlr-jRmQRD8,216560,218640,that as merely as can be nothing
rlr-jRmQRD8,218640,220159,particularly revolutionary as far as
rlr-jRmQRD8,220159,221680,these chinese launchers go but it does
rlr-jRmQRD8,221680,223200,have a pretty stock android vibe which
rlr-jRmQRD8,223200,225120,is always good to see you got your usual
rlr-jRmQRD8,225120,227519,apps train or google discover feed and i
rlr-jRmQRD8,227519,229040,can't see a way of actually bringing
rlr-jRmQRD8,229040,231200,that in from the home screen settings
rlr-jRmQRD8,231200,232959,there is a display google app option but
rlr-jRmQRD8,232959,234959,that seems to do bugger all and
rlr-jRmQRD8,234959,237680,mercifully because this is a 6.8 inch
rlr-jRmQRD8,237680,239360,behemoth you can drag down the
rlr-jRmQRD8,239360,241200,notifications bar from anywhere on the
rlr-jRmQRD8,241200,243120,desktop so there's a one-handed mode as
rlr-jRmQRD8,243120,245280,well which there you go usually takes me
rlr-jRmQRD8,245280,247200,a couple of uh stamps to actually get it
rlr-jRmQRD8,247200,248720,to load up you just got to swipe down at
rlr-jRmQRD8,248720,250640,the bottom edge of the screen basically
rlr-jRmQRD8,250640,252159,definitely always delighted by a bit of
rlr-jRmQRD8,252159,254159,one-handed help as i have quite stubby
rlr-jRmQRD8,254159,256000,little fingers and it would take a good
rlr-jRmQRD8,256000,257280,long while to go through all the other
rlr-jRmQRD8,257280,259359,bonus bits packed away into my os
rlr-jRmQRD8,259359,260320,because there's quite a lot
rlr-jRmQRD8,260320,261680,personalization settings you've got
rlr-jRmQRD8,261680,263840,loads to tinker about with here you can
rlr-jRmQRD8,263840,265520,add themes mess around with the look of
rlr-jRmQRD8,265520,267600,the icons the fingerprint animation has
rlr-jRmQRD8,267600,269440,gotten always on display you can get
rlr-jRmQRD8,269440,271520,that on a custom schedule if you want
rlr-jRmQRD8,271520,273360,otherwise showing all of the time and as
rlr-jRmQRD8,273360,274800,you can see there are lots of different
rlr-jRmQRD8,274800,276639,efforts to choose between and fan
rlr-jRmQRD8,276639,278960,favorites like the zte locker or back in
rlr-jRmQRD8,278960,280400,action as well just displaying a
rlr-jRmQRD8,280400,282160,different wallpaper every time you
rlr-jRmQRD8,282160,284400,switch on the phone zt is also choked in
rlr-jRmQRD8,284400,287120,a screen edge miss touch prevention tool
rlr-jRmQRD8,287120,288880,as well which is set to light by default
rlr-jRmQRD8,288880,290639,and touchwind so far i've had no issues
rlr-jRmQRD8,290639,292720,with that whatsoever my palm flab
rlr-jRmQRD8,292720,294479,doesn't seem to be uh buggering up the
rlr-jRmQRD8,294479,296160,phone when it sort of intrudes ever so
rlr-jRmQRD8,296160,297680,slightly on that screen and then of
rlr-jRmQRD8,297680,299040,course you've got all the usual android
rlr-jRmQRD8,299040,300479,shenanigans as well including those
rlr-jRmQRD8,300479,302880,fantastic android 12 privacy features
rlr-jRmQRD8,302880,304880,always good to see and on a security tip
rlr-jRmQRD8,304880,307520,while the zt axon 40 ultra sports and in
rlr-jRmQRD8,307520,309840,display fingerprint sensor it is a basic
rlr-jRmQRD8,309840,311759,optical scanner rather than an
rlr-jRmQRD8,311759,313680,ultrasonic sensor which a lot of rivals
rlr-jRmQRD8,313680,316560,like the s22 series for instance sport
rlr-jRmQRD8,316560,318240,but at least that scanner is positioned
rlr-jRmQRD8,318240,320000,quite high up the display so you're not
rlr-jRmQRD8,320000,321919,like reaching all the way down here for
rlr-jRmQRD8,321919,323440,it and so far touchwood seems very
rlr-jRmQRD8,323440,325520,reliable indeed and yes that selfie
rlr-jRmQRD8,325520,328080,camera does support face unlock as well
rlr-jRmQRD8,328080,330240,and again touchwood seems to do the job
rlr-jRmQRD8,330240,332320,just tap that power button it scans for
rlr-jRmQRD8,332320,333600,you and despite the fact that it is
rlr-jRmQRD8,333600,335520,buried away underneath that display i've
rlr-jRmQRD8,335520,337600,had no real issues with it certainly as
rlr-jRmQRD8,337600,339280,long as you've got some decent lighting
rlr-jRmQRD8,339280,340960,so plenty to play around with here as
rlr-jRmQRD8,340960,342320,for the storage while you've got a
rlr-jRmQRD8,342320,346479,choice of 128 or 256 gigs of ufs 3.1
rlr-jRmQRD8,346479,347919,space as you can see there this is the
rlr-jRmQRD8,347919,350800,128 gig base model not too much space
rlr-jRmQRD8,350800,352800,taken up by system files either the bulk
rlr-jRmQRD8,352800,354800,of this is just bloody gentian impact as
rlr-jRmQRD8,354800,357039,usual and sadly as with most premium
rlr-jRmQRD8,357039,359759,smartphones in 2022 there is no support
rlr-jRmQRD8,359759,361840,for microsd memory cards just a
rlr-jRmQRD8,361840,364960,double-sided sim tray now that 6.8 inch
rlr-jRmQRD8,364960,367680,amoled screen is an absolute stunner it
rlr-jRmQRD8,367680,370560,is a full hd plus panel that's 2480 by
rlr-jRmQRD8,370560,373039,1116 and to be fair like every other
rlr-jRmQRD8,373039,375199,premium smartphone out there these days
rlr-jRmQRD8,375199,378000,that oled screen pumps out bright sharp
rlr-jRmQRD8,378000,380080,punchy images certainly ideal for
rlr-jRmQRD8,380080,381600,kicking back with some disney plus some
rlr-jRmQRD8,381600,383440,netflix or whatever even a good bit of
rlr-jRmQRD8,383440,385680,your favorite bold tech youtuber you've
rlr-jRmQRD8,385680,387520,got your wide viewing angles you've got
rlr-jRmQRD8,387520,389680,eye serum output when you bump that
rlr-jRmQRD8,389680,391039,brightness up to maximum levels
rlr-jRmQRD8,391039,393120,certainly fine for outdoor visibility
rlr-jRmQRD8,393120,395199,contrast is perfectly sharp some nice
rlr-jRmQRD8,395199,397039,deep blacks but of course the big whoop
rlr-jRmQRD8,397039,400000,of the zt axon 40 ultras display is the
rlr-jRmQRD8,400000,402479,fact that it is a full view panel
rlr-jRmQRD8,402479,405039,unhindered by notches or selfie cam
rlr-jRmQRD8,405039,408319,cutouts it is a cinephile's wit dream
rlr-jRmQRD8,408319,409919,like no other smartphones out there can
rlr-jRmQRD8,409919,411840,offer this sort of experience apart from
rlr-jRmQRD8,411840,414400,the likes of the sony xperia one mark iv
rlr-jRmQRD8,414400,416000,if you dive on into the display settings
rlr-jRmQRD8,416000,417520,there's plenty to tinker about with here
rlr-jRmQRD8,417520,418880,you've got the usual nightlight you've
rlr-jRmQRD8,418880,420639,got a reading mode which just makes
rlr-jRmQRD8,420639,422080,things a bit easier on the eye if you
rlr-jRmQRD8,422080,423759,are just enjoying some text you can play
rlr-jRmQRD8,423759,425840,around with the color output and this
rlr-jRmQRD8,425840,427759,display does top off at 120 hertz
rlr-jRmQRD8,427759,429759,refresh rate as well i'm not sure if
rlr-jRmQRD8,429759,431520,it's ltp or tech though so i'm not sure
rlr-jRmQRD8,431520,433680,if it drops as low as one hertz when the
rlr-jRmQRD8,433680,435759,screen is barely in use and then as for
rlr-jRmQRD8,435759,437680,the audio wallet is a stereo speaker
rlr-jRmQRD8,437680,439120,setup as you can see both speakers
rlr-jRmQRD8,439120,441599,mounted on the edges of the device so
rlr-jRmQRD8,441599,443599,let's crank up the volume see if it's
rlr-jRmQRD8,443599,444800,actually good
rlr-jRmQRD8,444800,446560,chipset which has been packed into loads
rlr-jRmQRD8,446560,448000,of other phones including the black
rlr-jRmQRD8,448000,450800,shark 5 gaming handset the mortal h20
rlr-jRmQRD8,450800,453360,pro the poco f4 of course so overall
rlr-jRmQRD8,453360,455520,good stuff pump up that volume and
rlr-jRmQRD8,455520,457039,you'll have no problem whatsoever
rlr-jRmQRD8,457039,458639,enjoying a youtube video even in a
rlr-jRmQRD8,458639,461520,fairly sort of noisy environment uh the
rlr-jRmQRD8,461520,463120,top speaker isn't quite as powerful as
rlr-jRmQRD8,463120,464720,the bottom speaker there's a slight
rlr-jRmQRD8,464720,466319,imbalance but to be honest it's not
rlr-jRmQRD8,466319,468319,really noticeable when you are just
rlr-jRmQRD8,468319,469599,watching a video or whatever it's not
rlr-jRmQRD8,469599,471120,unless you like muffle the speakers that
rlr-jRmQRD8,471120,473039,you sort of really can pick up on that
rlr-jRmQRD8,473039,475120,fact and the audio quality is absolutely
rlr-jRmQRD8,475120,476720,fine as i say again just for you know
rlr-jRmQRD8,476720,479039,kicking back with a video or two if
rlr-jRmQRD8,479039,481120,you're going to be enjoying some music
rlr-jRmQRD8,481120,482720,you're going to want to get connected
rlr-jRmQRD8,482720,485120,with some bluetooth 5.2 action your
rlr-jRmQRD8,485120,487440,usual codec support for dtsx ultra
rlr-jRmQRD8,487440,489280,support on this thing as well so no
rlr-jRmQRD8,489280,490879,massive shocks when it comes to what
rlr-jRmQRD8,490879,494000,powers the zte axon 40 ultra it is of
rlr-jRmQRD8,494000,496479,course qualcomm's mega mighty snapdragon
rlr-jRmQRD8,496479,499360,8 gen1 chipset backed here by 8 gigs of
rlr-jRmQRD8,499360,501440,ddr5 ram although you can upgrade that
rlr-jRmQRD8,501440,503680,to 12 gigs if you want everyday
rlr-jRmQRD8,503680,505599,performance perfectly smooth strong
rlr-jRmQRD8,505599,507599,benchmarking scores as you would expect
rlr-jRmQRD8,507599,509440,but there's only one true test for the
rlr-jRmQRD8,509440,511120,performance and that is a good bit of
rlr-jRmQRD8,511120,514000,gention so i booted up gentian impact
rlr-jRmQRD8,514000,515599,boosted the graphics settings all the
rlr-jRmQRD8,515599,518080,way up to the maximum levels with 60
rlr-jRmQRD8,518080,520080,frames per second active as well and i
rlr-jRmQRD8,520080,522560,gotta admit my first experiences gaming
rlr-jRmQRD8,522560,524399,here on the axe and 40 ultra not
rlr-jRmQRD8,524399,526560,fantastic the screen sensitivity went a
rlr-jRmQRD8,526560,528320,bit all over the place with the
rlr-jRmQRD8,528320,530399,multi-touch so my character would start
rlr-jRmQRD8,530399,531920,running about the place even though my
rlr-jRmQRD8,531920,534000,fingers weren't anywhere near that left
rlr-jRmQRD8,534000,536399,edge of the screen which made batlin
rlr-jRmQRD8,536399,538959,gribly's kind of difficult got my arse
rlr-jRmQRD8,538959,541040,absolutely handed to me even worse than
rlr-jRmQRD8,541040,543200,normal but thankfully a swift reboot of
rlr-jRmQRD8,543200,545360,the axon 40 ultra seemed to sort it out
rlr-jRmQRD8,545360,547279,and touchwood that's an issue that won't
rlr-jRmQRD8,547279,549200,crop up again with that little bug
rlr-jRmQRD8,549200,550800,kicked right in the crotch the gaming
rlr-jRmQRD8,550800,552640,experience here on the axon 40 ultra was
rlr-jRmQRD8,552640,554880,pretty good the frame rate stayed nice
rlr-jRmQRD8,554880,557200,and stable very rare to see any kind of
rlr-jRmQRD8,557200,559600,proper jutter or stumble uh even when
rlr-jRmQRD8,559600,561519,things get pretty intensive though gotta
rlr-jRmQRD8,561519,563680,say after a fair bit of gaming on this
rlr-jRmQRD8,563680,565440,phone the top end was starting to heat
rlr-jRmQRD8,565440,567680,up rather badly that's despite the fact
rlr-jRmQRD8,567680,569440,that you've got a nine layer cooling
rlr-jRmQRD8,569440,571440,system packed inside of here including a
rlr-jRmQRD8,571440,573519,vapor chamber a bit of thermal gel all
rlr-jRmQRD8,573519,576000,the usual shenanigans i wasn't massively
rlr-jRmQRD8,576000,577680,surprised that it was heating up given
rlr-jRmQRD8,577680,580080,that it is quite a slender smartphone so
rlr-jRmQRD8,580080,581519,if you are going to be looking for a
rlr-jRmQRD8,581519,584399,phone to game on for a long period quite
rlr-jRmQRD8,584399,585760,regularly then you might want to look
rlr-jRmQRD8,585760,588000,elsewhere but otherwise just a half hour
rlr-jRmQRD8,588000,589519,here an hour there on a good bit
rlr-jRmQRD8,589519,591680,extension no worries and naturally
rlr-jRmQRD8,591680,593120,you've got your 5g support you've got
rlr-jRmQRD8,593120,595680,your wi-fi 6e support so no issues on
rlr-jRmQRD8,595680,598160,the connectivity so the wi-fi nice and
rlr-jRmQRD8,598160,600640,nippy i downloaded that gentian impact
rlr-jRmQRD8,600640,603120,file in absolutely record time and i'm
rlr-jRmQRD8,603120,604720,certainly impressed on the battery front
rlr-jRmQRD8,604720,606800,as well because in that slender chassis
rlr-jRmQRD8,606800,608800,it's packed a 5 000 milliamp hour
rlr-jRmQRD8,608800,610959,capacity cell and that certainly seems
rlr-jRmQRD8,610959,613519,to be doing the job i'm down to 47
rlr-jRmQRD8,613519,615040,battery that's after several hours of
rlr-jRmQRD8,615040,617200,screen on time now for lots of streaming
rlr-jRmQRD8,617200,619120,of media a good bit of gention of course
rlr-jRmQRD8,619120,620560,i've been streaming some deezer and some
rlr-jRmQRD8,620560,622240,podcasts and everything as well so i
rlr-jRmQRD8,622240,623440,reckon this thing will see you through
rlr-jRmQRD8,623440,626160,the day no worries whatsoever when it
rlr-jRmQRD8,626160,628399,does come time to recharge as well no
rlr-jRmQRD8,628399,630160,worries there because the zt axon 40
rlr-jRmQRD8,630160,632959,ultra support 65 watt fast charging yeah
rlr-jRmQRD8,632959,634480,it's not quite as impressive as a lot of
rlr-jRmQRD8,634480,636560,rivals from like some xiaomi and really
rlr-jRmQRD8,636560,639440,you've spat out 150 watt fast charging
rlr-jRmQRD8,639440,641200,for instance but you know plug it in for
rlr-jRmQRD8,641200,642480,10 minutes you'll get enough charge to
rlr-jRmQRD8,642480,644640,see through a few hours of use
rlr-jRmQRD8,644640,646000,unfortunately though no wireless
rlr-jRmQRD8,646000,647360,charging support or certainly at the
rlr-jRmQRD8,647360,648800,very least it didn't seem to like my
rlr-jRmQRD8,648800,650720,wireless charging pads that i tested it
rlr-jRmQRD8,650720,652959,with so that's a bit of a bum especially
rlr-jRmQRD8,652959,654720,as it's a pretty standard feature for
rlr-jRmQRD8,654720,657120,premium smartphones so now dear friends
rlr-jRmQRD8,657120,660240,let's finish up this zte axon 40 ultra
rlr-jRmQRD8,660240,662720,unboxing with a squint at a triple 64
rlr-jRmQRD8,662720,665360,meg camera setup that primary camera
rlr-jRmQRD8,665360,669120,sensor is a 64 megapixel sony imx 787
rlr-jRmQRD8,669120,670640,with built-in optical image
rlr-jRmQRD8,670640,672399,stabilization the shutter speed is
rlr-jRmQRD8,672399,674160,reasonably quick as long as it isn't low
rlr-jRmQRD8,674160,675680,light conditions in which case sometimes
rlr-jRmQRD8,675680,678320,it takes its sweet time to process the
rlr-jRmQRD8,678320,680640,image and the focal speed nice and nippy
rlr-jRmQRD8,680640,682959,as well as you can see there zt actually
rlr-jRmQRD8,682959,684800,refers to the primary shooter as the
rlr-jRmQRD8,684800,686800,humanity camera saying that it's the
rlr-jRmQRD8,686800,689120,perfect way to capture living subjects
rlr-jRmQRD8,689120,691200,and certainly i agree so far my test
rlr-jRmQRD8,691200,692720,shots came out really really nice the
rlr-jRmQRD8,692720,694720,portrait mode in particular really helps
rlr-jRmQRD8,694720,696640,to highlight your subject keeps them
rlr-jRmQRD8,696640,698399,nice and sharp in focus while the
rlr-jRmQRD8,698399,700160,background is blurred out with a bokeh
rlr-jRmQRD8,700160,702480,style effect the action 40 ultra doesn't
rlr-jRmQRD8,702480,704399,shoot its pants when there's strong
rlr-jRmQRD8,704399,706640,contrast or particularly bright light
rlr-jRmQRD8,706640,708720,about as well it does really really well
rlr-jRmQRD8,708720,710720,in daylight and also in more ambient
rlr-jRmQRD8,710720,713120,conditions as well once you move indoors
rlr-jRmQRD8,713120,715040,the images don't get particularly soft
rlr-jRmQRD8,715040,716959,or grainy color reproduction's still
rlr-jRmQRD8,716959,719360,strong as well just remember to turn the
rlr-jRmQRD8,719360,722160,stupid watermark off like i didn't when
rlr-jRmQRD8,722160,723680,it comes to night shots we do have that
rlr-jRmQRD8,723680,725519,night mode which can help to brighten
rlr-jRmQRD8,725519,728399,things up a bit the zt xn40 ultra isn't
rlr-jRmQRD8,728399,730240,quite as impressive as some rivals but
rlr-jRmQRD8,730240,732959,it'll do the job in a pinch as you can
rlr-jRmQRD8,732959,734800,see there the camera ui is pretty dense
rlr-jRmQRD8,734800,736320,as well absolutely packed with different
rlr-jRmQRD8,736320,737920,tools and features including the usual
rlr-jRmQRD8,737920,740480,ai scene recognition it's your got a
rlr-jRmQRD8,740480,742639,good bit of filter action too there is a
rlr-jRmQRD8,742639,744240,pro mode if you want it it's a pretty
rlr-jRmQRD8,744240,745680,good one as well you got a good bit of
rlr-jRmQRD8,745680,747760,histogram action who doesn't love that
rlr-jRmQRD8,747760,749120,you can play around with like the white
rlr-jRmQRD8,749120,751360,balance the focus and of course shoot in
rlr-jRmQRD8,751360,753680,raw format if that is your bag you've
rlr-jRmQRD8,753680,755600,got dedicated portrait and night modes
rlr-jRmQRD8,755600,757760,and just bugger tons of other stuff that
rlr-jRmQRD8,757760,759760,you can piddle about with if you want to
rlr-jRmQRD8,759760,761760,and you've even got a moon mode and a
rlr-jRmQRD8,761760,763760,story sky mode which apparently can pick
rlr-jRmQRD8,763760,766000,out star constellations for you when you
rlr-jRmQRD8,766000,768240,aim at the camera up at the night sky
rlr-jRmQRD8,768240,769839,unfortunately i live in britain where
rlr-jRmQRD8,769839,772320,there's constantly a thick dense layer
rlr-jRmQRD8,772320,774480,of cloud maybe i'll get a chance to test
rlr-jRmQRD8,774480,776079,that out if i ever go off to
rlr-jRmQRD8,776079,777839,australia or something the second
rlr-jRmQRD8,777839,779279,shooter slapped on the back end of this
rlr-jRmQRD8,779279,782560,phone is yet another 64 meg imx 787
rlr-jRmQRD8,782560,784399,sensor but this time it's an ultra wide
rlr-jRmQRD8,784399,786800,angle shooter with a 16 mil focal length
rlr-jRmQRD8,786800,788320,so as you can see this offers a more
rlr-jRmQRD8,788320,790560,pulled back view of the action when you
rlr-jRmQRD8,790560,792160,need to fit a bit more into frame or you
rlr-jRmQRD8,792160,794399,just want particularly dramatic results
rlr-jRmQRD8,794399,797440,and then last up is a 64 meg periscope
rlr-jRmQRD8,797440,800959,shooter with a 5.7 times optical zoom
rlr-jRmQRD8,800959,803120,this maxes out at 40 times zoom when you
rlr-jRmQRD8,803120,805120,crop in and you've got optical image
rlr-jRmQRD8,805120,806720,stabilizations that everything isn't
rlr-jRmQRD8,806720,808880,shaking about on the screen when you do
rlr-jRmQRD8,808880,810720,zoom right in thankfully and i gotta say
rlr-jRmQRD8,810720,812240,it's a pretty good one as well
rlr-jRmQRD8,812240,814079,definitely no complaints here it's one
rlr-jRmQRD8,814079,816160,of the better telephoto shooters that
rlr-jRmQRD8,816160,817440,i've tested out lately although
rlr-jRmQRD8,817440,818800,obviously not quite on the level of the
rlr-jRmQRD8,818800,821440,likes of the samsung galaxy s22 ultra
rlr-jRmQRD8,821440,824160,with its mega bonkers spear zoom if you
rlr-jRmQRD8,824160,825600,like to shoot horror movies well you'll
rlr-jRmQRD8,825600,827600,probably get on pretty well with the zt
rlr-jRmQRD8,827600,830160,axon 40 ultra because as you can see
rlr-jRmQRD8,830160,832720,they can shoot ultra hd 4k resolution
rlr-jRmQRD8,832720,834959,video at 30 or 60 frames per second
rlr-jRmQRD8,834959,836959,otherwise you've also got the option to
rlr-jRmQRD8,836959,839920,shoot with 8k and that is with all three
rlr-jRmQRD8,839920,842320,lenses impressively unfortunately seems
rlr-jRmQRD8,842320,844000,a little bit buggy at the moment
rlr-jRmQRD8,844000,845440,hopefully this will be sorted soon but i
rlr-jRmQRD8,845440,847360,can't shoot ak video with the primary
rlr-jRmQRD8,847360,849360,lens and also with the ultra wide angle
rlr-jRmQRD8,849360,850639,lens although you can't actually swap
rlr-jRmQRD8,850639,852079,between them as you're shooting you have
rlr-jRmQRD8,852079,854399,to choose one and then off you go but
rlr-jRmQRD8,854399,856399,when i try shooting with the telephoto
rlr-jRmQRD8,856399,858079,lens as you can see there it just guffs
rlr-jRmQRD8,858079,860639,out a camera unavailable error message
rlr-jRmQRD8,860639,862800,and then crashes the camera up hopefully
rlr-jRmQRD8,862800,864320,they'll be uh be fixing that in an
rlr-jRmQRD8,864320,865839,update of course this phone is
rlr-jRmQRD8,865839,868480,pre-released so it is early software so
rlr-jRmQRD8,868480,870160,uh you know don't worry too much about
rlr-jRmQRD8,870160,872320,that and then last of course cannot
rlr-jRmQRD8,872320,875760,forget that 16 megapixel selfie shooter
rlr-jRmQRD8,875760,877600,buried away underneath the display and
rlr-jRmQRD8,877600,879920,unfortunately the quality of the selfies
rlr-jRmQRD8,879920,882160,is impacted somewhat by the fact that it
rlr-jRmQRD8,882160,884320,is tucked away underneath the screen you
rlr-jRmQRD8,884320,886480,don't quite get the same crisp detail
rlr-jRmQRD8,886480,888160,the same accurate tones that you would
rlr-jRmQRD8,888160,890480,do with a standard selfie camera and
rlr-jRmQRD8,890480,892160,especially when you're shooting indoors
rlr-jRmQRD8,892160,894639,in more ambient light images look very
rlr-jRmQRD8,894639,897519,grainy indeed i mean just just just what
rlr-jRmQRD8,897519,899440,even is that and if you want to shoot a
rlr-jRmQRD8,899440,901519,bit of video of yourself with that front
rlr-jRmQRD8,901519,903600,facing selfie cam well this tops off at
rlr-jRmQRD8,903600,906079,full hd resolution or 4k or 8k
rlr-jRmQRD8,906079,908160,shenanigans for you unfortunately but i
rlr-jRmQRD8,908160,909680,reckon that even if you could shoot at
rlr-jRmQRD8,909680,912079,ultra hd level probably would look
rlr-jRmQRD8,912079,914880,fantastic similar to the selfie stills
rlr-jRmQRD8,914880,916639,spaffed out by this thing and there you
rlr-jRmQRD8,916639,918399,have it my pretties that in a nutshell
rlr-jRmQRD8,918399,921600,is the fresh new zte accent 40 ultra
rlr-jRmQRD8,921600,923920,flagship smartphone and i gotta say yeah
rlr-jRmQRD8,923920,925600,there's a couple of compromises in there
rlr-jRmQRD8,925600,927839,including the usual lack of a headphone
rlr-jRmQRD8,927839,929600,jack despite the tease of the earphones
rlr-jRmQRD8,929600,931440,being bundled in the box the lack of
rlr-jRmQRD8,931440,933600,micro sd memory card support as well for
rlr-jRmQRD8,933600,935759,expanding that storage and yeah those
rlr-jRmQRD8,935759,938800,selfies look rather balls but if you can
rlr-jRmQRD8,938800,940160,put up with all of that and frankly i
rlr-jRmQRD8,940160,942079,hate taking selfies anyway i only do it
rlr-jRmQRD8,942079,944480,because of this bloody job so i can
rlr-jRmQRD8,944480,946240,quite happily live without ever doing
rlr-jRmQRD8,946240,948320,that ever again there's a lot to love
rlr-jRmQRD8,948320,950240,here including of course the fantastic
rlr-jRmQRD8,950240,952560,full view display the sleek design the
rlr-jRmQRD8,952560,954240,dependable performance and the excellent
rlr-jRmQRD8,954240,956320,battery life as well so are you tempted
