_vsMQulZ5Bw,560,5759,i'd i would start off by saying that  you when you read about this this car a
_vsMQulZ5Bw,5759,12160,lot of things are fixated on the numbers  you know so it's like seriously fast  this is electronically limited the super
_vsMQulZ5Bw,12160,19039,sport to 440. it's a false limit because  a couple of years ago we did 490. so  when it's a false limit the speed goes
_vsMQulZ5Bw,19039,25439,up to that really quickly  it's not like you're waiting forever for  the last few so it's 1 600
_vsMQulZ5Bw,25439,30800,ps 1 600 newton meters  so all these numbers but that only tells
_vsMQulZ5Bw,30800,36079,the performance story  then when you sit in the car you get the  other things coming to you so it's
_vsMQulZ5Bw,36079,41760,really important that you drive the car  the quality of all the materials the  refinement of
_vsMQulZ5Bw,41760,47600,the ride  things like the the weighting of the  controls
_vsMQulZ5Bw,47600,53920,the brake and the steering there is a  lovely amount of weight to it most  supercars will have the taco in the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,53920,59120,center  ask the speedos in the center  it almost doesn't matter
_vsMQulZ5Bw,59120,64640,how many rpm you use  but because it's got so much torque yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,64640,69760,max talk is from two to six thousand rpm  so  what i'll
_vsMQulZ5Bw,69760,75520,do is just as a little demo here i'll  pop it into third gear so all i'm going  to do third gear i'm just going to tip
_vsMQulZ5Bw,75520,81040,into it just gently and then  estimate 800
_vsMQulZ5Bw,83759,90720,794 yeah that's not a bad estimation  three eight nine eight yeah that's crazy  so that was a little introduction to
_vsMQulZ5Bw,90720,96320,the bugatti chiron supersport by mr andy  wallace the living legend the winner of
_vsMQulZ5Bw,96320,102479,24 hours of le mans sebring and daytona  thank you very much for joining me today
_vsMQulZ5Bw,102479,108479,um we're going to handle it a little bit  differently today as you can see we're  starting with a co-drive then i'll be
_vsMQulZ5Bw,108479,115920,able to drive the car myself and after  that we will do the walk around at the  castle at the factory so
_vsMQulZ5Bw,115920,122000,it will be fun to do it kind of in a  reverse order to  experience the car first and then
_vsMQulZ5Bw,122000,129119,sort of based on that experience i'll be  able to  walk you through all the exterior  features and the development of the car
_vsMQulZ5Bw,129119,137200,afterwards and maybe we can make sense  of some of the stuff we're experiencing  as well  afterwards so that's a little intro
_vsMQulZ5Bw,137200,146520,andy wallace thank you so much for  taking me  we're going to experience the car first  at your hand you have driven this car at
_vsMQulZ5Bw,146520,153519,490 kilometers an hour  how was that  that believe it or not is 140 meters per
_vsMQulZ5Bw,153519,161120,second or a kilometer every seven  seconds  at the beginning of the straight where  we did it the test track bw test track
_vsMQulZ5Bw,161120,168959,you don't see the other end  after a few seconds you're there yeah  it's incredible uh and what a car
_vsMQulZ5Bw,168959,174640,it's amazing no vibration  no massive noise  yeah you've got to hold on to it a bit
_vsMQulZ5Bw,174640,181680,because it's really fast but  amazing it's something i'll never forget  i can imagine so we were just visiting
_vsMQulZ5Bw,181680,188239,the the little museum  and the veyron was there the the vitesse  it's amazing that's only six years and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,188239,193920,you went from 408 in the payroll to 490.  yeah it's quite quite impressive isn't
_vsMQulZ5Bw,193920,200400,it  uh because the motor industry in general  are fantastic at what they do you know
_vsMQulZ5Bw,200400,205840,they solve a lot of problems our cars  are getting better and better and better  and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,205840,212799,yeah it's amazing i don't know where the  the limit ultimately is  at the end of the the long straight
_vsMQulZ5Bw,212799,218480,we were still the speed was still  climbing yeah you have to pick a point  and slow down at that point so
_vsMQulZ5Bw,218480,225360,that's amazing  really amazing  but  again as we said earlier
_vsMQulZ5Bw,225360,230560,if you build a car just to go 490 or 500  kilometers now that's one thing yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,230560,235760,that's not what we've done here we  this is a proper car refined easy to
_vsMQulZ5Bw,235760,241480,drive  usable on any kind of road
_vsMQulZ5Bw,242080,248239,so all i'm going to do now before we  hand over i just want to show you the  acceleration in first first gear so once
_vsMQulZ5Bw,248239,255840,you get 25 celsius  in the tire temperature yeah we've now  got 28 29 and 30 yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,255840,262400,there is no wheel spin even in first  gear okay because if you if you give a  car let's say a car's got 800 horsepower
_vsMQulZ5Bw,262400,269600,and you can't pull all the power down  you can give it another 2 300 horsepower  it's not going to accelerate any faster  yeah so this is this is the first thing
_vsMQulZ5Bw,269600,275680,that shocked me when when the shield  first came out but all this power and  all this talk and it's all transmitted
_vsMQulZ5Bw,275680,282720,onto the road which is incredible yeah  so i'm just going to make sure there's  nothing around the corner and then
_vsMQulZ5Bw,294080,300720,so you've got these uh massive brakes  air brake  and you can  lose the speed quicker than you can put
_vsMQulZ5Bw,300720,306880,it on but there's no drama huh having  said that the drama is that everything's  coming towards you yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,306880,312000,you can see what the horsepower was 1  forty one thousand six hundred fourteen
_vsMQulZ5Bw,312000,317919,ps that felt amazing oh it's the  security though yeah it's you know
_vsMQulZ5Bw,317919,323199,that's a really big rush but  it's the car this is not exactly a dead
_vsMQulZ5Bw,323199,330560,smooth road either yeah and yet the car  just goes where you point it  it's so stable i mean we've driven
_vsMQulZ5Bw,330560,335919,14 1500 horsepower cars before but when  you drive those you basically have to
_vsMQulZ5Bw,335919,342400,say a prayer and hope that the car goes  in the right direction and that it stays  in one piece basically
_vsMQulZ5Bw,342400,348800,well that's it when we swap seats you'll  feel the other suffixes like  communication through the steering is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,348800,354880,unbelievable for a car that weighs  1950 kilos
_vsMQulZ5Bw,354880,359919,you would swear blind it was a lot  lighter yeah  third of the weight of the car is just
_vsMQulZ5Bw,359919,365120,the engine and gearbox yeah i can  imagine because that thing is massive it  is massive in fact when you look at the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,365120,370319,car you don't see where it could  possibly be hiding yeah no we were  walking around the atlea and it was they
_vsMQulZ5Bw,370319,377120,were showing us where the two things are  mated  married  and it's i said like if you look at it
_vsMQulZ5Bw,377120,383360,like this it almost feels like when they  made the engine to the front of the car  that the car would tip over
_vsMQulZ5Bw,383360,389680,yeah and yeah the car has 45 of his  weight on the front axle yeah that's so  smart and that's because the gearbox is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,389680,395840,near yeah  and that's it's quite heavy so the  engine is as big and as heavy as it is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,395840,401360,not not to get power you could get this  power from a v8 but it's for durability
_vsMQulZ5Bw,401360,407360,yeah so there's no major service  components on the engine for two or  three hundred thousand kilometers it's
_vsMQulZ5Bw,407360,414000,oil and sparkles  yeah it's all about stress on the engine  the bigger the engine the less stress
_vsMQulZ5Bw,414000,420880,yeah and it's still only 100 horsepower  per cylinder yeah so it's not stressed  in any way so
_vsMQulZ5Bw,420880,425919,it's a remarkable engine and just the  fact that  the gears are very tall of course they
_vsMQulZ5Bw,425919,432800,are to reach these speeds but  if you get on the throttle there's no  kick down in manual so if you get on the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,432800,438960,throttle and say third fourth gear when  you're very low rpm down at a thousand  let's say yeah initially there's some a
_vsMQulZ5Bw,438960,446080,small amount of lag and then you just  feel the boost just pushing you from the  back it's amazing
_vsMQulZ5Bw,446240,452080,maybe just do that here actually  so we're going way too low rpm yeah but
_vsMQulZ5Bw,452080,457199,if i just just push and then you'll just  feel it coming and it's just
_vsMQulZ5Bw,457199,463199,push  yeah that's insane
_vsMQulZ5Bw,463360,468400,so how would you say this compares to  the payroll for instance
_vsMQulZ5Bw,468400,473840,it's hard to remember what the veyron is  from 2006 i believe the first customer
_vsMQulZ5Bw,473840,479360,cars were delivered so this is an  awful long time ago isn't it um so
_vsMQulZ5Bw,479360,484400,the veyron was what you could do back  then and and uh one of the things that
_vsMQulZ5Bw,484400,489840,changes a lot  in the car industry really fast are the  electronics and the control systems for
_vsMQulZ5Bw,489840,496080,everything so  when i drive the veyron i i think it's a  wonderful machine but then you it kind
_vsMQulZ5Bw,496080,502319,of dates itself because the electronics  were what were available there yeah  and now with the stability control that
_vsMQulZ5Bw,502319,508160,we have although we're not spinning the  wheels  even in first gear let's say you're in  the middle of a corner in a very low
_vsMQulZ5Bw,508160,515279,gear and you open the throttle and the  stability control does operate  it's it does it in a very nice quick and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,515279,521680,subtle way yeah be it you know it could  be reducing power output putting it on  individual brakes it just happens in a
_vsMQulZ5Bw,521680,527200,heartbeat and then  you're off again um you couldn't have  that kind of controller with available
_vsMQulZ5Bw,527200,533440,it was kind of almost on or off yeah  yeah  so that's that's  some of the difference
_vsMQulZ5Bw,533440,540640,i always thought the braking on the  veyron was was reasonable good actually  but the braking on this is just
_vsMQulZ5Bw,540640,547519,another level completely  [Music]  with the air brake and the mechanical  brakes together we can pull a maximum of
_vsMQulZ5Bw,547519,554880,2g  deceleration that's for a road car  that's  that's that's ridiculous it really is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,554880,560320,and so when the the rear wing deploys  in the air brake position
_vsMQulZ5Bw,560320,565519,it's not purely just creating more drag  it's obviously creating more downfalls  but it's pulling the aerodynamic center
_vsMQulZ5Bw,565519,570800,of pressure rearward yeah and stabilizes  the car it gets rid of some of the  weight transfer if you have to break
_vsMQulZ5Bw,570800,577200,from very high speed and it also  interacts with the rear diffuser did you  see this yeah i was just looking at it
_vsMQulZ5Bw,577200,582399,there's a lot of scratch marks on it  which is not us that must be somebody  else because i've just lifted the car 10
_vsMQulZ5Bw,582399,587519,millimeters only i'm not even gonna go  over it slowly completely
_vsMQulZ5Bw,587519,594399,it could get so many mega yeah the um  the overhang is quite short on the front
_vsMQulZ5Bw,594399,599920,and helps massively with that  [Music]
_vsMQulZ5Bw,599920,606079,so in eb  mode which is the mode i've been in eb  and also autobahn since i left but in eb
_vsMQulZ5Bw,606079,612640,mode it's a 115 millimeter front ride  height and 116 rear so  essentially it's flat
_vsMQulZ5Bw,612640,617680,and then  if you don't change anything when you  reach  when you're on the autobahn and you
_vsMQulZ5Bw,617680,623200,reach 180 it will default into autobahn  which drops the rear one millimeter in
_vsMQulZ5Bw,623200,628959,the front of 20. yeah so the angle of  attack is yeah yeah you've got more rake  you lower yeah it also raises the rear
_vsMQulZ5Bw,628959,634399,wing to 10 degrees  and it's different to suspension  slightly i mean instead of me talking
_vsMQulZ5Bw,634399,639760,about how nice it is to drive you should  find out for yourself right i can give  you a quick um
_vsMQulZ5Bw,639760,643959,tour around the back of the car sure
_vsMQulZ5Bw,648800,654640,so  over and above the normal shear on it's  actually 23 millimeters longer yeah at
_vsMQulZ5Bw,654640,661120,the back so long tail version if you  like um the wing  is in us in the same position but the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,661120,666640,wings actually longer so you need a  lower angle to get yeah okay
_vsMQulZ5Bw,666640,672560,or the same angle less drag  um and then not only is the the back of  the body longer also the diffuser is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,672560,678480,longer and then by turning the exhausts  into this vertical position you've got  much more diffuser area yeah i was
_vsMQulZ5Bw,678480,684800,wondering about this because i know that  there are two extra exhaust pipes there  there are yes is that is that part of a
_vsMQulZ5Bw,684800,691120,blown diffuser type idea or yeah and  obviously that only gives you the  benefit of the high rpm yeah um but
_vsMQulZ5Bw,691120,696640,actually all of the shields have got  these two it's also okay yeah it's not  just specifically okay so the super
_vsMQulZ5Bw,696640,703360,sport oh that's cool um and so yeah  you can see the proximity of the wing to  the diffuser so there is quite an effect
_vsMQulZ5Bw,703360,708480,especially with the air brake yeah  pulling it and you'll notice when you  brake it it's but first of all it's
_vsMQulZ5Bw,708480,713519,impressive how  quickly you lose the speed but  the stability when you press the brake
_vsMQulZ5Bw,713519,718720,yeah i mean it encourages you to press  the brake cars if you you know some cars  when they're teetering on the edge when
_vsMQulZ5Bw,718720,723839,you're braking from high speed but this  is absolutely not like that at all so  the idea of the long tail is to get this
_vsMQulZ5Bw,723839,729040,as close as possible right yeah yep  that's it this is the tear off here you  want that water drop
_vsMQulZ5Bw,729040,734240,yeah shape yeah i mean you know  ultimately i guess we  yeah we should be out here but it's a
_vsMQulZ5Bw,734240,740760,bit of a  problem to park the ultra long hotel  yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,744079,750079,so  this is actually quite a big moment for  us for our channel  since
_vsMQulZ5Bw,750079,755839,we basically started as two idiots  wanting to drive fast cars and starting
_vsMQulZ5Bw,755839,761040,to film them  the veyron was just released back then
_vsMQulZ5Bw,761040,767120,and i mean that back then that seemed  like  unobtainable yeah and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,767120,772720,12 years later here we are  with andy wallace i mean what the hell
_vsMQulZ5Bw,772720,779360,happened  okay yeah but we're all lucky aren't we  because we're all doing what we like to  do i mean we are we are
_vsMQulZ5Bw,779360,783199,so  started out before yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,785120,790720,that is one  starter motor i will never forget yeah  even the sound of the subject yeah it's
_vsMQulZ5Bw,790720,795920,awesome it sounds like a jet firing up  yeah okay and then if you shut the door
_vsMQulZ5Bw,795920,801360,yeah if you if i go on to the digital  look yeah well it's actually 700 now  quite often it's down in the 60s yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,801360,807360,yeah yeah 600 so it's idling at 660  right now  it's mental
_vsMQulZ5Bw,807360,812880,okay so uh we'll  hit that once that's it
_vsMQulZ5Bw,812880,815839,next
_vsMQulZ5Bw,817920,823199,temperature so we're good and i can see  from the  picture on the left that the car is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,823199,830079,still up okay so yeah it's still lifted  yeah  okay so  we're going to turn right so driving the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,830079,836079,chiron i mean i know that this has been  a  a goal from the get-go back when the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,836079,842480,veyron came out to build an amazing  machine with amazing performance but  also be able to do stuff like this i
_vsMQulZ5Bw,842480,847600,think it was like take my wife to the  opera was one of the that's it yeah one  of the things that they wanted to
_vsMQulZ5Bw,847600,854079,accomplish with this car and i'm  obviously just going to ask you this  because you're here otherwise i would be  talking about the car but
_vsMQulZ5Bw,854079,862959,i mean if you compare  your record run in the mclaren f1  to i mean that was 386 right
_vsMQulZ5Bw,862959,868800,387 so if you compare that to this  that really demonstrates
_vsMQulZ5Bw,868800,874399,what they've achieved uh with setting  that goal  it's amazing and if you if you need a
_vsMQulZ5Bw,874399,881199,short answer what's the difference  well 100 kilometers an hour yeah  and i don't know you you probably know
_vsMQulZ5Bw,881199,888240,this for yourself there's a lot of cars  that go 300 there are some cars that go  350. yeah but even if you go from 300 to
_vsMQulZ5Bw,888240,893760,330  on a where it's legal  that's a massive difference and that is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,893760,899199,also true when you start going i mean  i've been  420 before because uh the sheridan and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,899199,905040,sheridan sport are limited to 420 yeah  so i had been 420 on the test track  before  but then
_vsMQulZ5Bw,905040,910639,in fact they gave me a car with the  speed limiter removed the weekend before  we did the speed run yeah just to go and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,910639,916800,get used to it so  the first time you exceed 420 it's it  feels so much faster yeah and it might
_vsMQulZ5Bw,916800,923199,only be another five or 10k yeah  um but yeah we did a lot of running  during during the week that we were
_vsMQulZ5Bw,923199,929199,there and we were doing lots of  validation to make sure that all the  aerodynamic numbers were correct and  there was enough load for an area that
_vsMQulZ5Bw,929199,936320,we weren't going to have any issues  and then yeah basically  go yeah and yeah i'll never forget that
_vsMQulZ5Bw,936320,942800,it's amazing  i can imagine  okay so uh let's uh go into manual mode
_vsMQulZ5Bw,942800,950480,experience a couple of gears here  so this is fifth  it's a very tall gear
_vsMQulZ5Bw,953120,958560,so the thing i love about these like big  turbocharged cars is that they sound
_vsMQulZ5Bw,958560,965040,almost industrial like  i mean  the sound of the the engine
_vsMQulZ5Bw,967040,974399,and the blow off of those turbos it  sounds like it could power a factory  that's so i absolutely love that sound i
_vsMQulZ5Bw,974399,981519,mean  a high-pitched  oh yeah high-pitched v12 ferrari or  something like that is amazing but
_vsMQulZ5Bw,981519,987120,this has something so  so industrial and i even saw that
_vsMQulZ5Bw,987120,994079,when they do the testing on the dyno  they attach these  rods to the wheels and they use the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,994079,999600,the power to power parts of the factory  it you know it feels exactly like i was
_vsMQulZ5Bw,999600,1003600,expecting it to feel  but
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1014560,1021399,yeah the feel of the of all the controls  like you said it is quite amazing
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1033050,1039120,[Music]  light over there don't worry yeah just
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1039120,1041918,uh yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1048319,1054640,you've got a hairbrush oh  man  that is ridiculous
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1054640,1060400,that is like  the most incredible feeling car i've
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1060400,1067360,ever  experienced to be honest  and it's not intimidating at all
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1067360,1073679,it's really not i mean before you jump  in that's the first thing that comes to  mind isn't it yeah  that is amazing
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1073679,1080080,man  and then  almost you could say that the chassis  could take another more you know a
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1080080,1085679,couple hundred more yeah  yeah but where does it end yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1085679,1092960,so the tires  would they take more  that's one of the reasons why it's  limited right well yeah it's limited for
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1092960,1099760,for quite a lot of safety reasons so  the normal shell and shell sport tyre
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1099760,1105840,michelin took them to the test drive in  the u.s that was used to test the space  shuttle tires yeah and did a lot of
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1105840,1112960,testing on them and they decided that  that tyre would have been okay to do  what we were looking to do
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1112960,1119919,but  for them that they're always super safe  they wanted a bit more margin so they  produced a different tyre for us to do
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1119919,1126400,the wrong which is now on the silver  spot yeah  the last before they put the last layer  of rubber on there are some radial
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1126400,1132799,metal  uh  strengthening okay  so they change the material
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1132799,1139919,to a stronger material so that it can  retire more in shape yeah in those  speeds so  at 490 there is a seven
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1139919,1145600,ton tearing force on the tire yeah  that's crazy that's incredible isn't it
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1145600,1152960,so  that's now pushed to the maximum speed  of the tyre well beyond the top speed of  this car
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1154240,1159440,but yeah in terms of the  electronic limit i mean
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1160080,1169039,we did a lot of running and i did a  thousand kilometers above 400  wow what i noticed was up till about 460
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1169039,1174559,around this  everything's normal and then
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1174559,1180400,74 84.99  are there of course you know the wheels
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1180400,1188160,are going around so fast and what  what happens is the gyroscopic effect of  the wheels turning so fast overcomes
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1188160,1194480,these  the suspension geometry yeah the cast  ring yeah so the car then needs
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1194480,1200640,a little bit more attention to yeah to  keep it straight and so  yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1200640,1206240,everything's fine  that's awesome  a thousand kilometers over 400
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1206240,1212799,kilometers an hour yeah during during  the week that we were there yeah you  know because you get used to speed don't  you so there's a few times you do it
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1212799,1218880,it's quite alarming but yeah in the end  i i kept  of course i was concentrating the whole
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1218880,1226480,time but i didn't really sort of fully  concentrate until we'd exceeded 400 each  run yeah um which sounds really stupid
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1226480,1233520,no but i i know the feeling the more  often you do it yeah you're you sort of  start doing things automatically and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1233520,1238880,exactly you need less yeah okay so we've  got a nice bit of road here to  experience
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1238880,1248400,the chiron's handling we've got double  wishbones front and rear  yeah okay so there are quite a few bumps
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1248400,1253760,but the car just behaves  so predictably
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1257919,1263320,brakes are amazing that pedal feel is  glorious
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1265200,1270320,four hundred and twenty millimeter  carbon discs right ceramics around it
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1270320,1276640,yeah  the calipers have got four pads  in each side and eight pistons actually
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1276640,1283440,here is ours thanks guys  okay sure  so as i said it's a bit different than
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1283440,1289440,uh the stuff we usually do but we've  even got a film crew right now who are  going to shoot some car to car
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1289440,1295200,so i'll definitely incorporate that in  the review as well  nice road
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1295200,1302240,some vines here  feels like a holiday  so driving footage is done we are now
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1302240,1307600,going to experience launch control  bugatti claims 2.4 seconds zero to 100
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1307600,1315039,right  so that is  well crazy in itself but uh we're going  to experience what that feels like on
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1315039,1321039,this little road later on down there  uh because we're quite low now yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1321039,1327840,it will uh i'll tell you where to live  okay  sure  left foot on the brake
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1327840,1335600,more than 100 bar of pressure  hit the button  launch control full throttle
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1345039,1350720,that will get your juices flowing  that is incredible
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1350720,1355760,and that is on a undulating bumpy ride  yes that is not much time temperature
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1355760,1362000,yeah that was not perfect  man that's amazing that is amazing
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1362000,1367840,there was a bit of slip in the beginning  yeah yeah but then it hooks up and it  just it's off  man
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1367840,1374559,that is massive  oh that i'm i'm telling you that torque
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1374559,1378679,is so addictive
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1390080,1397039,it's quite ridiculous to be honest i've  never i've never experienced anything  like this i mean the lamborghini huracan
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1397039,1402720,sto  is sort of the same in the in the in the  sense that you can feel
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1402720,1409440,what is happening you know what every  wheel is doing how much power can i use  how much steering input can i use yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1409440,1414559,it just communicates with you and  only the really great cars do that but
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1414559,1419919,at the same time it's doing it as a as a  very comfortable very refined so you can
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1419919,1426640,if you focus the car towards just that  quality you've described  i can understand it but this is not
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1426640,1430480,giving up  anything
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1433039,1438080,yeah yeah you can relax as well yeah  yeah the huracan sto is a very hardcore
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1438080,1446320,car yeah so yeah i get what you're  saying it's it does that this car does  that but it also has the the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1446320,1451360,the broadness of the ability of you know  a daily driver yeah and if you jump out
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1451360,1459039,the car  now  and drive to the south of france it's  luxury so yeah so it's such a broad yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1459039,1464240,ability yeah  but an interesting fact
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1465520,1471440,when they did when they was uh doing all  the development on the launch control  they did
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1471440,1479520,200 launches  on the same car before they would sign  it off 200 launches on one car yeah
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1479520,1485440,and i mean 100 would have been quite a  lot yeah  so it's it's bulletproof yeah i mean the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1485440,1493279,the the amount of force that is uh right  yeah  the amount of force that is unleashed
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1493279,1499279,upon this gearbox  on this entire car is incredible and the  way it deals with it is absolutely
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1499279,1505520,amazing i mean  it it it does so like no other car i've  ever experienced well i i was very
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1505520,1512159,fortunate in my racing career to drive  some really fast cars yeah and i was  quite shocked with myself this the first
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1512159,1516480,time wow is that where the level is now
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1521039,1527840,you know how fast the steering rack is  turned yeah  faster  sometimes that could mean some
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1527840,1533600,instability no but it doesn't feel  nervous i noticed that as well it's very  direct and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1533600,1540559,but but at the same time  because the suspension soaks up  everything so well yeah you don't notice
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1540559,1546400,yeah you don't have like that  interference  no that's right
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1546400,1550960,so here you should be quite  free
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1552960,1559520,very bad surface oh man  i love that view of the air brake in my
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1559520,1562159,mirror as well
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1566080,1571919,okay  all right guys so i hope you enjoyed  this introduction into driving a
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1571919,1578080,bugatti shiro super sport it has been  amazing to experience this car andy
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1578080,1583360,thank you so much for taking me for my  pleasure guiding me and we just heard
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1583360,1588960,that andy is being installed in the hall  of fame at sebring so he is leaving for  that after this which is amazing
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1588960,1594159,congratulations on that thank you um you  deserve it you are a legend and i feel
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1594159,1600640,so honored to be  instructed by you in a bugatti  absolutely very nice drive i really
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1600640,1606720,enjoyed it thank you me too all right so  let's take it to the castle and do a  walk around
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1606720,1613200,so ladies and gentlemen here we are at  the castle we are going to cover the  shiro super sport i'm going to do a walk
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1613200,1621440,around after my drive with andy wallace  now we've had a tour around the grounds  this is the chateau saint jean and it is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1621440,1629200,absolutely magnificent it was completely  rebuilt when volkswagen took over this  was all basically gone so were the two
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1629200,1637120,editions and the orangery it is an  absolutely magnificent place and the  history here is just palpable and i
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1637120,1644799,think  the fact that  they really tried to incorporate that  history into the new bugattis is is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1644799,1650880,really really special and when you know  about it when you know about the history  like the horseshoe in the grill and the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1650880,1656559,big sea you start seeing it everywhere  and that is just really really awesome
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1656559,1663360,so  this here on supersport of course it is  the  high speed version of the chiron you've
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1663360,1668960,got a couple of different versions the  chiron the shiron sport the chiron  puresport
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1668960,1675679,the shield supersport and the chiron  supersport 300 plus now i just took a  drive with andy wallace who as i said
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1675679,1681520,did the high speed run the top speed run  of 490 kilometers an hour in
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1681520,1687919,a super sport  and that's why they had that 300 plus  special edition 30 of those were made
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1687919,1694799,they were immediately sold out of course  all chirons are now sold out they were  going to build 500 of them
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1694799,1700799,spread out over all the different  versions and then they have a couple of  special editions as well like the devo
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1700799,1706880,that is on top of those 500 but all of  them are sold out so  today i'm going to show you the spec
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1706880,1713200,we've got it in and i'll walk you  through some of the most amazing things  on the car
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1713200,1720559,yeah i mean some of you have been with  us for a long time now on our channel  this is probably
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1720559,1726000,peek out the top now right now that we  are here and the funny thing is that
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1726000,1731760,we started doing this because we just  wanted to drive fast cars but  it's become more about sharing the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1731760,1737200,experience with you guys now which is  really funny i just i just want to share  everything with you instead of just
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1737200,1743520,driving it myself which is quite cool  okay so at the front we've got a  completely new redesigned front bumper
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1743520,1749279,to reduce lift to increase downforce and  it's all carbon fiber down there all
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1749279,1756320,glossy carbon fiber but as you probably  know you can do pretty much anything you  want with these cars you can
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1756320,1762720,customize  everything and they have a special place  for that which is in there you sit with
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1762720,1769440,an expert and he shows you what you can  do and also  guides you in you know what looks great
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1769440,1775039,with what and that is pretty awesome now  the 300 plus edition has these two
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1775039,1781279,orange stripes across the car you are  not allowed to order a super sport with  those stripes because that's just for
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1781279,1787279,the 300 plus edition now this car is  almost entirely black with carbon it is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1787279,1793039,entirely black with carbon and i do  think it looks really good it looks so  sinister and  i mean
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1793039,1798240,a brighter color does  accentuate the lines a little bit better  maybe but i do think that this looks
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1798240,1804080,like freaking batmobile top speed car  um the horseshoe as i said a nod to
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1804080,1810799,history uh going back like to the 1920s  and 30s when they were making the royal
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1810799,1818080,and the type 35  really really awesome brand and the fact  that they always strived for perfection
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1818080,1823120,has led them to bankruptcy a couple of  times actually and i do think that it is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1823120,1828720,such a fitting brand to be basically  selected by vw to
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1828720,1834159,to  build this new brand on which has so  much history i can't really explain what
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1834159,1840880,it feels like here but it's very serene  there are only 130 people working here  at bugatti and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1840880,1846399,it's just a very nice place to be there  are deer behind this  chateau
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1846399,1852399,it's just very very nice so as you know  the shirt is much more aggressive than
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1852399,1857840,the veyron it is much more angry  basically the front end and then when we
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1857840,1865679,move to the side we can see that these  nine holes have been installed here this  is a not to the eb-110 super sport of
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1865679,1871360,the 19 what is that 90s and it actually  extracts air out of the wheel wells uh
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1871360,1877279,reducing lift as well you can see the  grades here and then we've got these  forged wheels 20 inch at the front we've
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1877279,1883039,got 420 millimeter carbon ceramic brakes  with amazing stopping power and then
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1883039,1888880,we've got these specially made michelin  pilot sport cup 2 tires and you can
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1888880,1894399,actually see that there's a bg2 code on  there right there that means that this
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1894399,1901039,tire was specifically designed for this  car of course top speed is 440  kilometers an hour when you use the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1901039,1908320,second key 380 when you don't use the  key yeah they needed to develop some  serious tires for this car a big side
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1908320,1915120,skirt down the side and we've got the  big c  right there  which runs through
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1915120,1921039,the bugatti history like i mean you see  it everywhere even in the art and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1921039,1926480,furniture that they used to make that  bugatti used to make it just works so
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1926480,1933440,well all around the car you can see the  spine as well running from front to rear  that is also something you can see on
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1933440,1939519,older bugattis like the atlantic which  is one of my all-time favorite cars i  used to have a model car of the atlantic
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1939519,1945919,and of the  type 35 so  yeah you see so much cool stuff super
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1945919,1952320,sport on the fuel filler cap as well and  of course some radiators here behind  that intake
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1952320,1958320,and then we get to the business end  these i think 285 front tires by the way
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1958320,1963600,section that's quite wide and then at  the rear
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1963600,1969679,we've got three 55s and 21 inch wheels  so one size up
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1969679,1975039,but this is the business end of the  shiron of course we just visited the  factory and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1975039,1981600,we actually saw how they mated the front  part of the carbon tub to the engine and  the gearbox so the engine sits right
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1981600,1986720,there which of course is the heaviest  part and then  you've got the gearbox sitting around
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1986720,1993519,there so that means that you still have  45  to 55 weight distribution 45 front so
_vsMQulZ5Bw,1993519,2001200,that's not bad considering there's a  massive uh  8 liter w16 engine sitting right there
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2001200,2006640,now the super sport is  centimeters longer than a regular chiron
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2006640,2012080,so it is a long tail and that ensures  just better stability better arrow now
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2012080,2019760,big wing here which is also longer also  works as an air brake and then we've got  the dual exhaust two on each side in a
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2019760,2026720,regular chiron you've got two massive  ones in the center if you have a chiron  sport it's four separate tail pipes and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2026720,2034480,with this one it is  arranged like this so they could fit a  bigger diffuser and there are two extra
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2034480,2040320,exhaust pipes in there as well  and of course the beautiful rear light
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2040320,2047120,the led ribbon running across the rear  with the eb logo  absolutely gorgeous now if there's one
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2047120,2053760,thing i've learned from being here today  is that this thing is  drop that gorgeous i mean i knew i was
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2053760,2059200,going to like this car of course but  it just looks like it's sculpted by the  gods
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2059200,2065679,the gods of speed of course but i mean  it is such a pretty car
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2065679,2072720,absolutely ridiculous and i mean it's  much prettier than the veyron which sort  of looked like everything had a function
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2072720,2078560,and that's why it looked that way but  this car just looks like  it's shaped by the wind which is super
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2078560,2086079,super cool  so the engine i'm not sure i can show  you any more than this but i love the  fact that it is just exposed
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2086079,2091118,a lot of carbon you can customize all  this as well you can choose the color  you want on that you can choose the
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2091118,2096960,color of the carbon fiber we just saw  the most amazing specs in the factory
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2096960,2104079,i mean there are going to be some  beautiful cherrys out on the roads  especially that pure sport is really
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2104079,2109440,really cool with the big wing  so on the inside
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2109440,2116560,we've got this  cognac leather everything on this car is  magnificent so the leather quality is as
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2116560,2121760,well  i mean this car gets used a lot so it's  a bit dirty right now but
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2121760,2128079,it is just absolutely stunning a lot of  carbon fiber everywhere and the thing  that struck me most when i was walking
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2128079,2135520,through the factory is that it's such a  combination between craftsmanship and  high-tech manufacturing so
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2135520,2141280,there are a lot of people walking around  doing stuff with their hands but it all  looks super clean and uh
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2141280,2146320,i mean yeah it looks super futuristic  basically  but everything is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2146320,2153839,so high quality that i mean of course  you need it to be  if it's three million euros but
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2153839,2159760,i mean yeah it is insane so we've got  this gorgeous carbon fiber dash in this  car with
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2159760,2166480,a very simplistic  that this is basically a dash because  you've got all these little screens
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2166480,2174079,high definition screens there  to have a lot of info and then you've  got the big c running inside the cabin
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2174079,2179520,as well which is  just one of my favorite parts of the  entire car that is absolutely
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2179520,2185520,beautiful and then you've got a little  window to look behind you and see the  engine and the air brake
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2185520,2191119,and you can also get the skyview  glass panels in here which also
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2191119,2197040,increases headroom by five centimeters  so that is really great for me and then  in front of us we've got this beautiful
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2197040,2202480,steering wheel absolutely gorgeous  carbon fiber leather  aluminium and then the driving mode
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2202480,2208640,button so eb is basically automatic this  is  lift i guess and then auto band mode and
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2208640,2215280,track mode start engine and launch  control as you've seen  on the road we've done that as well
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2215280,2220720,but it is just so  clean and beautiful everything is
_vsMQulZ5Bw,2220720,2225839,everything you touch is just  magnificent  and then of course down here we've got
