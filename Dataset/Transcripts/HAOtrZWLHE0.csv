HAOtrZWLHE0,400,3600,You wanna exercise your freedom on the world but you don't wanna exercise it on yourself. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,4640,7439,"Oh, you'll shut the world down for telling you what you can't do "
HAOtrZWLHE0,7440,9920,but you won't say nothing to you when you don't do what you're supposed to do. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,10560,12400,You're not getting up when  you're supposed to get up 
HAOtrZWLHE0,12400,14559,you're procrastinating but you let you slide. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,15520,18000,You wanna hold them accountable? Hold yourself accountable too. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,18960,22880,You always wanna blame other people you wanna hold other people to the fire 
HAOtrZWLHE0,22880,26080,but you're not holding yourself to the fire. There are things you like 
HAOtrZWLHE0,26080,30320,you have absolutely no control you are like a slave to you. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,30320,33040,You need to look at yourself in the mirror and say 
HAOtrZWLHE0,33040,35360,why are you only giving 50%? What's wrong with you? 
HAOtrZWLHE0,37520,40960,And you need to get rid of them excuses and you need to stop pointing fingers at people 
HAOtrZWLHE0,40960,44160,and you start pointing fingers at yourself what did you not do? 
HAOtrZWLHE0,44160,48160,And the reason why we fast from time to time is not that we have to fast 
HAOtrZWLHE0,48160,51760,"but at some point, you gotta fast because you gotta tell the flesh "
HAOtrZWLHE0,51760,54320,who's in control. I'm in control 
HAOtrZWLHE0,54320,57360,you're not in control. I know you don't want to wake up 
HAOtrZWLHE0,57360,60160,you don't have an option. Get up. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,60160,63680,We're trying to eat. There's a certain lifestyle we want. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,63680,67120,'Cause I owe it to myself. And can't nobody stop me but me. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,69040,72480,You are not where you wanna be not because you need any more gifts. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,73040,76880,You need to discipline yourself. You need to learn to tell you no 
HAOtrZWLHE0,76880,78880,tell you stop tell you quit. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,78880,81280,You gotta get to a point where you're disciplined. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,81280,85760,It might require you saying no to your friends. It might require you changing your diet. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,85760,88080,Whatever it takes you gotta be willing to do it. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,88080,90720,And you keep saying you're not there because of something else 
HAOtrZWLHE0,90720,95520,because it's easier to blame somebody else. I have to take complete ownership. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,95520,98640,I had to look at all the things  that I didn't have control over 
HAOtrZWLHE0,98640,100400,and say I gotta take control. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,101760,103920,Why? When you master yourself 
HAOtrZWLHE0,103920,107439,you put yourself in a position that a lot of people can't do what you do 
HAOtrZWLHE0,107440,110320,and then you become rare and diamonds are rare 
HAOtrZWLHE0,110320,113440,that's why they cost so much. You have to be willing 
HAOtrZWLHE0,113440,115520,to grit it out. You have to be willing 
HAOtrZWLHE0,115520,119520,to push through discomfort. Nothing that you're about to try or do 
HAOtrZWLHE0,119520,122479,that is worthwhile is going to be comfortable for you 
HAOtrZWLHE0,122480,126080,during the process of creating it. Stop with this hope sh*t. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,126080,129679,Stop with this I wish sh*t. And start replacing those terms 
HAOtrZWLHE0,129679,132159,with I will f*cking do no matter what. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,134160,136880,It's a commitment it's not a feeling. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,136880,139520,Commitments don't have nothing  to do with your feelings. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,139520,142960,You do it because you're supposed to. It's a lifestyle. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,142960,145680,Instead of hitting that f*cking snooze button in the f*cking morning 
HAOtrZWLHE0,145680,147840,and not making your bed and not cleaning your house 
HAOtrZWLHE0,147840,149840,you don't hit the snooze button. You get up. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,149840,151519,Don't wanna go run? You go run. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,151520,154720,You don't wanna go swim? You go swim. You don't wanna make your bed? You make your bed. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,154720,156400,You don't wanna clean your  house? You clean your house. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,156400,160000,You don't wanna study? You f*cking study. That's how you start to callus your mind 
HAOtrZWLHE0,160000,162400,it's gonna suck. It's not gonna be fun. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,162400,165360,Do something that sucks every single day of your life. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,165360,169440,That's how you grow. Make every day your masterpiece. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,169440,172880,The secret of your success is determined by what we do daily. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,172880,175680,And here's the crazy part all you gotta do is look in the mirror 
HAOtrZWLHE0,175680,179359,all you gotta do is deal with yourself and then we're gonna get to a whole 'nother level. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,179360,182800,Embrace the pressure. Pressure creates diamonds. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,182800,186720,Start to take the pressure that you feel from what it is you want to do 
HAOtrZWLHE0,186720,190240,and turn that into productive action. Let it be the thing 
HAOtrZWLHE0,190240,194640,that makes you get where you wanna go when everybody else is just taking it easy. 
HAOtrZWLHE0,194640,197760,No more playing after today. I need you to take control 
HAOtrZWLHE0,197760,202080,over every single area. And we're gonna do it one day at a time 
HAOtrZWLHE0,202080,211840,and you're gonna get control. And then someday is gonna be your day.
