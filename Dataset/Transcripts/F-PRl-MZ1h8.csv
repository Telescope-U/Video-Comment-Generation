F-PRl-MZ1h8,1980,4290,"- [Narrator] Alright, we're halfway through 2022,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,4290,6750,so like every year let's take a look back
F-PRl-MZ1h8,6750,8610,and round up some of the best games
F-PRl-MZ1h8,8610,10019,that have released so far.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,10020,13020,"Now keep in mind these are the Gameranx team's choices,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,13020,14820,you're definitely gonna have different picks
F-PRl-MZ1h8,14820,16800,so we'd love to hear yours in the comments.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,16800,19919,"Now we've got 10, actually more than 10 games to talk about,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,19920,21300,so let's get going.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,21300,23970,"Starting off at number 10, ""Dying Light 2."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,23970,26369,Now this is the followup to one of our favorite games
F-PRl-MZ1h8,26370,27330,here at Gameranx
F-PRl-MZ1h8,27330,29550,and we think it mostly lived up to it.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,29550,31320,"The open world setting was really cool,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,31320,34200,the parkour free-running trap-setting stuff was even better
F-PRl-MZ1h8,34200,35033,"this time around,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,35033,37470,and the combat gave you a lot of options
F-PRl-MZ1h8,37470,38850,on how to take down enemies.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,38850,41370,It just felt like an expanded version of the first game.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,41370,44340,Now it's not quite as challenging as the first game
F-PRl-MZ1h8,44340,46290,and there's a lot more story stuff
F-PRl-MZ1h8,46290,47970,and I think it's kind of up for debate
F-PRl-MZ1h8,47970,50610,"how much of that decision-making really pays off,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,50610,51750,but what you have here is just
F-PRl-MZ1h8,51750,53640,a straight up fun video game
F-PRl-MZ1h8,53640,55800,open world exploration adventure
F-PRl-MZ1h8,55800,57809,with zombies and bad guys
F-PRl-MZ1h8,57810,59700,that's incredibly satisfying to play.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,59700,61320,"The simple stealth is satisfying,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,61320,62730,"all the hits feel good,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,62730,64050,the parkour free-running stuff
F-PRl-MZ1h8,64050,66390,"gives you a sense of speed and adrenaline,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,66390,68220,"and there is a lot to keep you busy,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,68220,70680,"a lot of side quests, a lot of side activities,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,70680,72900,and they don't all feel like pointless filler.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,72900,74370,And of course it's all set
F-PRl-MZ1h8,74370,77490,"in a really, really cool well-designed world"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,77490,80549,"with communities actually, in various different ways,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,80550,82590,handling the whole zombie apocalypse thing.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,82590,85020,It was kind of fun to really take all that in.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,85020,86310,"Now at this point we're through it,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,86310,88619,"it was a mill, we'd shoot it, we swallowed it,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,88620,90210,"that kind of sounds like a gross metaphor,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,90210,92310,but now essentially we're waiting for dessert
F-PRl-MZ1h8,92310,93810,"because the original ""Dying Light"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,93810,96240,"had some really awesome post-launch support,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,96240,97229,so we're looking forward to seeing
F-PRl-MZ1h8,97230,99810,"what Techland can really cook up for ""Dying Light 2"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,99810,101790,and this new world they set up.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,101790,103530,Now next over at number nine
F-PRl-MZ1h8,103530,105570,"we have ""Pokemon Legends: Arceus."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,105570,108240,Now there is definitely another open world 3D Pokemon
F-PRl-MZ1h8,108240,109619,"hot on the heels of this one,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,109620,111270,"but ""Pokemon Legends: Arceus"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,111270,112890,was kind of the first to really give
F-PRl-MZ1h8,112890,115140,"what a lot of people were hoping for,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,115140,117510,"just completely wandering around environments,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,117510,119250,"encountering Pokemon in the wild,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,119250,121590,"sneaking up behind them, tossing a Poke Ball,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,121590,123810,"battling in real time, all that stuff,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,123810,125700,and I think it mostly paid off.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,125700,127680,While the story and some of the setting
F-PRl-MZ1h8,127680,129390,wasn't as compelling as I was hoping
F-PRl-MZ1h8,129390,131730,"considering it's set in a before time,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,131730,133590,the core gameplay stuff is pretty good
F-PRl-MZ1h8,133590,136019,and I'm really excited to see where the Pokemon company
F-PRl-MZ1h8,136020,137250,is gonna take that further.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,137250,139800,We're really excited to see where this story goes next
F-PRl-MZ1h8,139800,142770,because this new gameplay foundation they built here
F-PRl-MZ1h8,142770,144993,is pretty cool and has a lot of potential.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,146130,147840,Now next over at number eight
F-PRl-MZ1h8,147840,149730,"we gotta talk about ""The Quarry."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,149730,153450,"This one recently released and it's from Supermassive Games,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,153450,156300,"the people behind ""The Dark Pictures Anthology"" games"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,156300,159660,"as well as one of our all-time favorites, ""Until Dawn,"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,159660,162090,"and ""The Quarry"" very much is straight up"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,162090,164129,"another game like ""Until Dawn"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,164130,166800,but focusing a little bit more on camp goofiness
F-PRl-MZ1h8,166800,168600,"like from '80s horror movies,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,168600,171990,"embracing just some of the teens soap opera drama stuff,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,171990,174420,but with some light humor and weird quirkiness
F-PRl-MZ1h8,174420,175709,"but still plenty of scares,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,175710,177210,"it's still gory and scary,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,177210,180270,but it's really based on moment-to-moment decisions.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,180270,181710,Where in other games like this
F-PRl-MZ1h8,181710,183060,these more interactive stories
F-PRl-MZ1h8,183060,185250,they rely a lot on quick-time events
F-PRl-MZ1h8,185250,186600,"and just quick button presses,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,186600,188880,this is actually more about the moment-to-moment decisions
F-PRl-MZ1h8,188880,190440,you make in the dialogue
F-PRl-MZ1h8,190440,192120,and how that affects the characters
F-PRl-MZ1h8,192120,193799,and really how the story plays out.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,193800,195270,"There's a lot of different outcomes,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,195270,196530,"there's a lot of different endings,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,196530,198600,"and it's just really satisfying to play through,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,198600,201240,whether alone in the dark by yourself
F-PRl-MZ1h8,201240,203160,"because the graphics are pretty good most of the time,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,203160,204990,or if you're just having some good times
F-PRl-MZ1h8,204990,206160,playing with some friends.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,206160,209310,It very much feels like a celebration of slasher
F-PRl-MZ1h8,209310,211200,kind of goofier-style horror movies
F-PRl-MZ1h8,211200,212430,and we love it for that.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,212430,214739,"Supermassive Games really, for the most part,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,214740,216000,just gets this stuff
F-PRl-MZ1h8,216000,217740,and we love playing through their games
F-PRl-MZ1h8,217740,219660,"and we think ""The Quarry"" is up there"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,219660,220983,as one of their best.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,221940,223567,Next over at number seven we have
F-PRl-MZ1h8,223567,226830,"""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,226830,229290,"If you like this type of game, let me tell you,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,229290,231390,this one is definitely gonna scratch that itch.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,231390,233550,"It's from Dotemu, they've done it again"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,233550,235230,"with Ninja Turtles in general,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,235230,237540,"they've just kind of straight up made a new,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,237540,240090,"fun, accessible, but still challenging"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,240090,242580,classic style Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles brawler.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,242580,244110,It is so awesome.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,244110,246660,"From the music to the static cut-scenes,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,246660,248970,"the soundtrack, the animations of the characters,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,248970,250200,"the little voice lines,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,250200,253620,all of it is filled with some fun old-school gameplay charm.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,253620,255330,And while some people can't go back
F-PRl-MZ1h8,255330,257459,"to this retro style of play,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,257459,259169,"the people that do, like us here,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,259170,260850,there is a lot to love here.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,260850,262770,"It's a short playthrough, it's nothing crazy,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,262770,264840,but there's a story mode and an arcade mode
F-PRl-MZ1h8,264840,266040,"and multiple difficulties,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,266040,268230,and it is so much better with friends.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,268230,270630,It supports up to six-player co-op
F-PRl-MZ1h8,270630,274740,"featuring the Turtles, Splinter, April, and Casey Jones,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,274740,277413,and if you love this stuff definitely give it a try.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,278370,279637,Next over at number six we have
F-PRl-MZ1h8,279637,281280,"""Kirby and the Forgotten Land."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,281280,282660,If you were looking for something good
F-PRl-MZ1h8,282660,284490,"on Nintendo Switch this year,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,284490,289289,this 3D Kirby adventure in some really interesting locations
F-PRl-MZ1h8,289290,290400,is really satisfying.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,290400,292080,"It's light-hearted, it's fun,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,292080,293400,"there's good stuff to collect,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,293400,295979,and Kirby can transform into a lot of cool things.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,295980,297570,"Now I'll be honest, we didn't get time to do"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,297570,299430,"a ""Before You Buy"" video for this game"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,299430,300780,"and initially cover it,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,300780,301950,but when we did check it out
F-PRl-MZ1h8,301950,303840,we found a really charming and fun
F-PRl-MZ1h8,303840,305970,kind of turn-off-your-brain Kirby game.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,305970,307260,We think those are important to have.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,307260,308850,"You know maybe it's not the best Kirby game,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,308850,311250,but it'll still probably put a smile on your face
F-PRl-MZ1h8,311250,312900,if you're into this stuff.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,312900,315840,"Now next over at number five we have ""V Rising,"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,315840,318900,another game that we haven't had a chance to cover yet
F-PRl-MZ1h8,318900,319860,here on Gameranx
F-PRl-MZ1h8,319860,322949,but after diving in and us dabbling here and there
F-PRl-MZ1h8,322950,324060,"we gotta say, man,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,324060,327120,this thing has game popularity on Steam specifically
F-PRl-MZ1h8,327120,328530,"a lot thanks to word of mouth,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,328530,330300,and it's pretty worth the hype.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,330300,333180,You wake up as a vampire and you have to build your empire.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,333180,336240,It's like a top-down large explorable world
F-PRl-MZ1h8,336240,338340,"with survivable elements, RPG elements,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,338340,339900,but also vampire elements.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,339900,341430,"You gotta worry about sunlight,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,341430,343470,"you gotta satisfy your thirst for blood,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,343470,345810,and it's just nice to see vampire games
F-PRl-MZ1h8,345810,346919,really having a comeback.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,346920,349950,"We're hoping 2022 is really the year of the vampire,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,349950,352230,"from ""Vampire Survivors"" really going viral"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,352230,354270,"to ""V Rising"" really kicking off."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,354270,356129,This is just a PC gamer's game
F-PRl-MZ1h8,356130,357570,"with some really cool combat,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,357570,360450,"satisfying enemy types, beautiful visuals,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,360450,361650,and good multiplayer.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,361650,363300,It's something you should definitely check out
F-PRl-MZ1h8,363300,364289,"if you're playing on PC,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,364290,366243,"we highly, highly recommend it."

F-PRl-MZ1h8,371430,372750,You probably wouldn't expect us
F-PRl-MZ1h8,372750,374220,to dive this deep into this one
F-PRl-MZ1h8,374220,375570,but it's just awesome.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,375570,378660,"It's a really well made perfect ""Star Wars"" package."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,378660,380430,If you were of that generation
F-PRl-MZ1h8,380430,382949,"that kind of grew up with the ""Lego Star Wars"" games"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,382950,385710,"or had younger siblings that really grew up with them,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,385710,387240,they've really become a thing.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,387240,388949,"They're satisfying well-made games,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,388950,389850,"there's great memes,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,389850,393180,"and ""The Skywalker Saga"" essentially is a celebration"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,393180,394199,of all those games.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,394200,396900,It basically gives you full adventures to play through
F-PRl-MZ1h8,396900,399690,"for each movie, all the main trilogies,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,399690,401820,and it gives you a ton of explorable

F-PRl-MZ1h8,403590,405960,"vehicles, a bunch of characters to play through,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,405960,407639,and tons of stuff to unlock.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,407640,409800,It's really a grind if you wanna see everything
F-PRl-MZ1h8,409800,412139,but even if you just wanna passively play through
F-PRl-MZ1h8,412140,414150,"to see all of your favorite ""Star Wars"" movies"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,414150,416520,"recreated in Lego once again,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,416520,417810,"there is a lot of charm here,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,417810,420630,there's some great inside jokes and references
F-PRl-MZ1h8,420630,422520,"and it plays better than your average ""Lego"" game."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,422520,424259,"They've really retooled the combat,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,424260,425790,"the third-person shooting,"

F-PRl-MZ1h8,430170,432870,"some classic ""Star Wars"" planets in the Lego style"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,432870,434250,but with great visuals.

F-PRl-MZ1h8,459390,464250,"way more interesting cultures, NPCs, side quests,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,464250,466320,"enemy types, world variety."

F-PRl-MZ1h8,468840,470100,"open world stuff,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,470100,471690,but a lot of it is actually meaningful
F-PRl-MZ1h8,471690,473280,and interesting and well made.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,473280,474210,For me in particular
F-PRl-MZ1h8,474210,476220,I just like some of the environmental puzzles
F-PRl-MZ1h8,476220,477930,you stumble upon in the open world.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,477930,480810,Aloy's adventure goes full-on crazy sci-fi
F-PRl-MZ1h8,480810,482100,"and kind of buck wild,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,482100,483870,"I still don't quite know how I feel about it,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,483870,486570,but the moment-to-moment gameplay from beginning to end
F-PRl-MZ1h8,486570,487890,was really satisfying.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,487890,490470,I don't know if it's one of Sony's best exclusive franchises
F-PRl-MZ1h8,490470,493230,"but when it's good and it's firing on all cylinders,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,493230,494490,this game is pretty awesome.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,494490,496050,"Also, it's crazy gorgeous."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,496050,498120,"I mean, look at it, it is a sight to behold,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,498120,500220,"from the environment, the level of detail,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,500220,502140,the way the characters look and emote.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,502140,503760,"It is like a visual feast,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,503760,507390,but thankfully it's got the gameplay chops to back it up.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,507390,509370,"Now down to number two we have ""Sifu."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,509370,512039,This is one of my personal favorite games of the year.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,512039,513990,It's just a simple brawler
F-PRl-MZ1h8,513990,515729,that's a little bit more than meets the eye.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,515729,517380,It is incredibly challenging
F-PRl-MZ1h8,517380,519690,and requires a lot from you the player.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,519690,521430,You need to memorize the enemies
F-PRl-MZ1h8,521430,524460,and really practice getting through a level unscathed
F-PRl-MZ1h8,524460,526920,because every time you die you get older
F-PRl-MZ1h8,526920,529350,"and there are certain ramifications that come with that,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,529350,531690,but if you keep dying and keep getting older
F-PRl-MZ1h8,531690,533280,eventually you're gonna be too old to fight
F-PRl-MZ1h8,533280,534750,and that's when you get a game over.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,534750,538170,So the hook is really to get through a level and beat a boss
F-PRl-MZ1h8,538170,539639,"as young as possible,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,539640,542100,"and that's an incredibly satisfying gameplay loop,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,542100,544110,especially when you just chop it up
F-PRl-MZ1h8,544110,546720,"with how the actual brawling, the fighting works."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,546720,549329,"The blocking, the dodging, the comboing,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,549330,551010,"all of it is quick and brutal,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,551010,553230,hallway John Wick old-boy style
F-PRl-MZ1h8,553230,555360,and it is so cool to pull off.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,555360,556829,"When you're doing well in this game,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,556830,558390,you truly feel like a badass.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,558390,560610,"That's what I really wanted to see leading up to this game,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,560610,561750,"watching the trailers and stuff,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,561750,563130,and I think they nailed it.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,563130,565770,From the bosses to the visual style of the levels
F-PRl-MZ1h8,565770,568680,to the animations to just like getting a quick throw
F-PRl-MZ1h8,568680,570899,"or a dodge or a perfect strike in there,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,570900,573067,all of it is just hmm chef's kiss.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,573067,575943,"""Sifu,"" clearly, we highly recommend."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,576930,579570,"Now down to number one, say it with me now."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,579570,581190,"Yep, ""Elden Ring."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,581190,583980,"I mean, this is like, of course, what did you expect?"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,583980,586050,"If you watch Gameranx you know we really love this game,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,586050,587670,"we've made tons of videos on it,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,587670,589920,"and ""Elden Ring"" straight up is pretty much at this point"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,589920,591660,the biggest FromSoftware game.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,591660,593250,Of course because of sales numbers
F-PRl-MZ1h8,593250,594540,"and hype and all that stuff,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,594540,597480,"but also I've seen more people jump into ""Elden Ring"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,597480,599339,than any other FromSoftware game.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,599340,601890,This seems to be for a lot of people
F-PRl-MZ1h8,601890,604500,the gateway drug to FromSoftware gameplay
F-PRl-MZ1h8,604500,605700,and their other games.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,605700,606900,"It's really special, of course,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,606900,608220,"for the FromSoftware touch,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,608220,609660,"you know, the challenging combat,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,609660,612000,"the crazy, over-the-top boss designs,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,612000,615690,but just really how filled this open world is
F-PRl-MZ1h8,615690,617430,with actual meaningful stuff
F-PRl-MZ1h8,617430,619529,to just stumble upon and discover.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,619530,622620,This game just consistently will blow you away
F-PRl-MZ1h8,622620,624960,for the entire length of time you're playing it.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,624960,626760,"Just when you think you've seen it all,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,626760,628920,you find a whole new massive area
F-PRl-MZ1h8,628920,631920,or a whole optional dungeon or a side boss.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,631920,634139,"The game, even when it's really challenging"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,634140,635250,"and when you hit a wall,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,635250,638190,"still manages to be consistently satisfying,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,638190,641160,consistently rewarding in a way we haven't seen
F-PRl-MZ1h8,641160,642870,with many open world games.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,642870,644820,There's gonna be plenty of people that comment and say
F-PRl-MZ1h8,644820,646170,"it's overrated, it's over-hyped,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,646170,647970,"and that's fine, agree to disagree."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,647970,649860,"We really, really like ""Elden Ring"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,649860,651720,and we're probably gonna be talking about it
F-PRl-MZ1h8,651720,653100,for years to come.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,653100,654720,Now those are some games that we think
F-PRl-MZ1h8,654720,656399,were great in 2022 so far
F-PRl-MZ1h8,656400,657690,but we also have some bonus games
F-PRl-MZ1h8,657690,659280,"we gotta mention, buckle up."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,659280,662520,"First, ""Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,662520,664800,This actually just dropped at the time of making this video
F-PRl-MZ1h8,664800,667019,"but so far it seems pretty awesome,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,667020,669570,it seems like a big step up from the previous game.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,669570,671160,"Also, ""Tiny Tina's Wonderlands"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,671160,673410,is actually a surprisingly good spin
F-PRl-MZ1h8,673410,674670,"on the ""Borderlands"" formula,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,674670,676440,it makes things pretty fresh.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,676440,679200,"Also, don't write off ""Evil Dead: The Game."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,679200,680250,"It's pretty fun,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,680250,682440,especially if you've got a good group of friends.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,682440,684300,"Also, not to mention ""Cuphead"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,684300,686760,"and ""The Delicious Last Course"" DLC."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,686760,688740,"It's quite a bit of content to jump into,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,688740,690480,"we've been fiending for more ""Cuphead."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,690480,692430,"Also it's worth highlighting that ""God of War"""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,692430,693960,got a PC version this year
F-PRl-MZ1h8,693960,696330,and that is an absolutely massive deal.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,696330,698880,"From people playing on a PC, which is also just great,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,698880,701730,to the mods that people have made are just nuts.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,701730,704399,"And also, ""The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe."""
F-PRl-MZ1h8,704400,707460,This is technically a re-release of an older PC game
F-PRl-MZ1h8,707460,710280,now on modern consoles but with a ton of new content
F-PRl-MZ1h8,710280,712410,that is let's just say really worth experiencing.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,712410,714000,I don't wanna spoil anything.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,714000,715050,But those are some great games
F-PRl-MZ1h8,715050,717120,that we have loved so far in 2022.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,717120,719010,"Like I said, you probably have"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,719010,720420,"plenty of other personal picks,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,720420,721253,so we wanna hear them.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,721253,723360,"If you've got your own top five or something like that,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,723360,724680,be sure to drop it in the comments.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,724680,725820,It will be good for us
F-PRl-MZ1h8,725820,727410,"but also other people looking in the comments,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,727410,729209,maybe they'll find a new game as well.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,729210,730110,"If you enjoyed this, though,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,730110,731519,"and you like talking games with us, man,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,731520,733470,clicking the like button's all you gotta do.
F-PRl-MZ1h8,733470,735810,"We would very much appreciate that, it helps us out."
F-PRl-MZ1h8,735810,738000,"But, as always, thanks for watching,"
F-PRl-MZ1h8,738000,739650,and we'll see you guys next time.
