iOv2elBzPLg,7200,13679,my name is maya  during one summer break i had visited my  friend's house her name is mahi
iOv2elBzPLg,13679,19119,she lives in sitara a district in  maharashtra india we enjoyed ourselves
iOv2elBzPLg,19119,25279,there because it's beautiful countryside  there were large farms and houses with a  river in the center
iOv2elBzPLg,25279,32238,well-paved roads between the dense  forest  on a sunday evening we decided to go to  a nearby snack stall to get something to
iOv2elBzPLg,32238,38640,munch on after that  we had a great time together walking on  the road we realized a little too late
iOv2elBzPLg,38640,45360,that it was starting to get dark  usually night seemed to be darker on the  countryside then mahi checked her cell
iOv2elBzPLg,45360,50960,phone and got nervous because there were  five missed calls from her mother we got  worried and looked around as no one
iOv2elBzPLg,50960,56480,seemed to be on the road  suddenly  it got dark we're talking pitch black as
iOv2elBzPLg,56480,62079,the road lights went off mahi said we  shouldn't stop until we find a rickshaw
iOv2elBzPLg,62079,67360,i nodded as we started heading to our  house  after several minutes we heard a muffled
iOv2elBzPLg,67360,72560,sound of an auto rickshaw we sighed in  relief  mahi told the driver to stop at her
iOv2elBzPLg,72560,78400,address  and to this the driver agreed  we both quickly hopped on our seats the
iOv2elBzPLg,78400,83600,driver asked why are you both roaming  around this late at night it's dangerous
iOv2elBzPLg,83600,89439,there have been so many crimes and  reports of paranormal incidents that  have taken place here after listening to
iOv2elBzPLg,89439,94560,this mahi was agitated but suggested  driving faster i thought to myself that
iOv2elBzPLg,94560,100479,she might know something that i didn't  but didn't want to tell me we peeped  through a small window of the otto
iOv2elBzPLg,100479,106960,rickshaw  and chills went through my nerves as  there was nobody out of nowhere a woman
iOv2elBzPLg,106960,113439,sprung out in front of our moving auto  rickshaw the driver pulled the brakes  haltingly mahi shouted and said let's
iOv2elBzPLg,113439,118479,help her  while saying this mahi was turning to  get out of the rickshaw but i grabbed
iOv2elBzPLg,118479,123520,her hand and said she isn't what she  seemed quickly the driver also changed
iOv2elBzPLg,123520,131039,his path and drove faster then mahi  looked outside and seeing this i also  looked back we were both petrified as
iOv2elBzPLg,131039,137440,the woman lying down was smiling  creepily at us with blood dripping out  of her mouth with this
iOv2elBzPLg,137440,143520,she disappeared  as we moved forward at last we finally  reached home
iOv2elBzPLg,143520,148720,our parents were waiting for us and as  they saw us they ran to us and hugged us  tightly
iOv2elBzPLg,148720,155440,following this we both caught a fever  and a headache  and we can't forget about the lady
iOv2elBzPLg,155440,160560,the next morning  strange news spread in all of the  neighborhoods of the dead body near the
iOv2elBzPLg,160560,167280,river and unfortunately  the body belonged to the auto rickshaw  driver who had dropped us off
iOv2elBzPLg,167280,174160,i was so scared that the next day i came  back home with my parents  soon mahi moved to my city as related
iOv2elBzPLg,174160,180560,murderous and spooky cases shook the  entire area  leaving the townsfolk in deep fear mahi
iOv2elBzPLg,180560,185760,and i are still together i turned 25  today and to this day
iOv2elBzPLg,185760,192239,this incident makes our blood run cold  we can't help but imagine what might  have happened if we had gotten out of
iOv2elBzPLg,192239,197239,the vehicle  and helped that woman
iOv2elBzPLg,198480,204159,i was born in a huge family  cousins from almost every country so it
iOv2elBzPLg,204159,210480,would be hard for me to be an introvert  i was also  the most misbehaved girl in our house
iOv2elBzPLg,210480,217920,i did so many stupid things while  growing up and i never listened to my  parents or anybody one time i remember i
iOv2elBzPLg,217920,223440,was in my hometown with my family i run  into the farms every time i go there
iOv2elBzPLg,223440,229599,this time was no different  nightfall came and i did the same my  parents were about to scold me when i
iOv2elBzPLg,229599,235360,came back  but when they saw that worried and  scared look on my face they took me
iOv2elBzPLg,235360,241360,inside i finally felt relieved when i  entered the house  i was only seven
iOv2elBzPLg,241360,247599,so  i didn't know anyone well there  so i met up with this boy named matthew
iOv2elBzPLg,247599,252799,i loved spending time with matthew he  was like a younger brother to me when i
iOv2elBzPLg,252799,257840,told my grandma about him she was  shocked and she asked me where he lived
iOv2elBzPLg,257840,264479,i told her that he lived at the other  side of the farm we had this mosque on  our side and whenever he heard the call
iOv2elBzPLg,264479,272639,of prayer he started to collapse and  close his ears shut which always made me  wonder why why he was like that however
iOv2elBzPLg,272639,279520,this night was the first time i'd ever  met him my summer vacation was ending so  we'd only planned to stay about a week
iOv2elBzPLg,279520,284880,when i told him that i was leaving he  just got up and  yelled at me
iOv2elBzPLg,284880,290560,are you crazy how can you leave me he  just shouted at me which made me worry
iOv2elBzPLg,290560,295840,about him and then i asked what was  wrong he didn't calm down he took a rock
iOv2elBzPLg,295840,301840,and he threw it the window of an  abandoned house  then we both just saw a dark figure
iOv2elBzPLg,301840,307199,passing by  mischievous me had the idea of going  inside to check it out
iOv2elBzPLg,307199,315440,and matthew agreed because we both like  an adventure  i actually thought it might calm him  down a little so we opened that huge old
iOv2elBzPLg,315440,321680,gate and went inside and let me tell you  it was a different atmosphere inside i
iOv2elBzPLg,321680,327520,could feel something like a weight it  was something really strange i looked at
iOv2elBzPLg,327520,335600,matthew and he seemed normal i tried to  ignore that feeling as we were standing  in the entrance we walked inside i can
iOv2elBzPLg,335600,342000,remember everything like it was  yesterday  matthew had his hands in his pockets and  he was whistling
iOv2elBzPLg,342000,348479,he was perfectly fine  on the other hand  me  my fists were clenched and i was trying
iOv2elBzPLg,348479,353759,not to cry because i felt so weird i  took deep breaths and closed my eyes
iOv2elBzPLg,353759,360400,after a few moments i opened my eyes  back up and matthew wasn't near me  anymore and at that moment
iOv2elBzPLg,360400,365600,a figure came running at me aggressively  i fell on the ground and screamed i
iOv2elBzPLg,365600,371520,screamed as loud and as hard as i could  until everything went black  and the next thing i knew i was waking
iOv2elBzPLg,371520,377840,up in my bedroom nobody talked to me  that entire day  and at the end of the week we left the
iOv2elBzPLg,377840,383120,next year we returned to the farm and i  didn't see matthew anywhere but for five
iOv2elBzPLg,383120,389440,years i kept thinking about him i  thought i would never see him again  but on that fifth year
iOv2elBzPLg,389440,395440,he was there with his bright smile and  luckily he remembered me i was so happy
iOv2elBzPLg,395440,403039,to see him again one night we were both  sitting in front of my house and  i asked him do you remember that day
iOv2elBzPLg,403039,411120,when we went into that house near the  farm and he took a sip of his soda and  said yes how could i ever forget that i
iOv2elBzPLg,411120,416479,asked him what had happened to me with  tears in my eyes he replied you just
iOv2elBzPLg,416479,423520,screamed and fainted after a long pause  he broke the silence between us and said
iOv2elBzPLg,423520,429199,it was  as if you had seen something  visibly upset i looked at him and
iOv2elBzPLg,429199,435039,stammered  how did  how do you how do you know that and he
iOv2elBzPLg,435039,442400,said you saw the ghost of that house  which is also after me  and it beats me up every time i hear the
iOv2elBzPLg,442400,449199,call of prayer  and a tear ran down my face because  i couldn't believe what he just said
iOv2elBzPLg,449199,456400,after that our families became a lot  closer and his cousin's brother and my  cousin's sister even got married because
iOv2elBzPLg,456400,460280,they had fallen in love
iOv2elBzPLg,466560,472240,this happened around my last year of  middle school  i joined a new school in seventh grade
iOv2elBzPLg,472240,478720,and had been bullied by kids in that  school ever since i joined even the kids  on my bus wouldn't leave me alone
iOv2elBzPLg,478720,484479,every day was the same  hop on the bus  get bullied and taunted get off at
iOv2elBzPLg,484479,489759,school and get bowling back on the bus  to get bullied again on the way home
iOv2elBzPLg,489759,495199,one day  when i got on the bus i was already in a  bad mood because my mom had nagged me
iOv2elBzPLg,495199,500639,about something petty i sat in my usual  spot which was one seat before the last
iOv2elBzPLg,500639,507280,seat on the left  i rested my head on the seat and decided  to try taking a nap within a few minutes
iOv2elBzPLg,507280,514719,the boys pulled my hair and started to  poke me and stuff which was something  that they do every day but it annoyed me
iOv2elBzPLg,514719,521599,more than usual this time i shouted back  and accidentally pushed them off a  little harder than usual
iOv2elBzPLg,521599,528399,shut up freak do us all a favor and die  he shouted back what surprised me
iOv2elBzPLg,528399,535200,is the teacher on our bus never said  anything about it in spite of that  a couple of girls joined in and started
iOv2elBzPLg,535200,540640,telling me how i'd never be good enough  and i'd be a worthless human for the  rest of my life
iOv2elBzPLg,540640,547360,all the bullying  it got to me  but not as bad as it did that day
iOv2elBzPLg,547360,553440,i started to twitch and my hands started  to shake  i felt a rush and definitely not the
iOv2elBzPLg,553440,560720,good kind  the kids laughed and passed it off as me  being weird  and then all of a sudden i blacked out
iOv2elBzPLg,560720,566399,when i came back to my senses  everyone was sitting in their seats  instead of surrounding me and looked a
iOv2elBzPLg,566399,572720,bit shaken  i stood up to look behind and the boy  that had earlier pulled my hair flinched
iOv2elBzPLg,572720,579600,i was so confused did i do something to  them the rest of the day went by fast
iOv2elBzPLg,579600,584720,and it was finally time to go home i got  on the bus and sat down in my usual seat
iOv2elBzPLg,584720,590720,but  nobody spoke or hit my head or anything  i was usually one of the last ones to
iOv2elBzPLg,590720,596720,get off the bus so once most of the kids  had left i asked the kid who sat in  front of me what had happened this
iOv2elBzPLg,596720,603279,morning  he said my eyes looked red and i had a  demented smile on my face and laughed
iOv2elBzPLg,603279,609200,one of the boys asked why i was laughing  and was about to say something  when i held him by his neck and
iOv2elBzPLg,609200,616079,whispered in his ear saying this  you're making me angry  and if you make me angrier i'll make
iOv2elBzPLg,616079,621680,sure i slit your throat and hide your  body where no one will find it
iOv2elBzPLg,621680,627760,do you understand me and if you anger me  again remember  you'll be seeing me
iOv2elBzPLg,627760,634399,very  soon  all of this while i was choking him  when somebody pushed me off and i passed
iOv2elBzPLg,634399,639760,out everyone was surprised because  i'm actually quite vulnerable and was
iOv2elBzPLg,639760,646480,very careful i haven't been angered like  this ever since  i don't exactly know what happened that
iOv2elBzPLg,646480,652480,morning but i'm guessing this is how my  shadow persona decided to make an  appearance i just hope
iOv2elBzPLg,652480,657079,this never  happens again
iOv2elBzPLg,664720,671600,people call me ren  this happened a few years ago when i was  in sophomore year
iOv2elBzPLg,671600,678560,one day me and my two friends carly and  jenny decided to go to carly's house for  a sleepover since it was a saturday and
iOv2elBzPLg,678560,685519,we all had no plans  around 6 pm  i went to carly's house and jenny was
iOv2elBzPLg,685519,691279,already there  i arrived the same time as the pizza  so we all decided to grab a few slices
iOv2elBzPLg,691279,698079,and go to carly's room  we talked and went on tick-tock and  snapchat for about an hour
iOv2elBzPLg,698079,703760,it was already 7 p.m and we were bored  so carly suggested that we go swim in
iOv2elBzPLg,703760,708880,our pool  we all agreed and then change into our  swimsuits
iOv2elBzPLg,708880,714079,carly's pool had a device that made the  water in the pool change colors
iOv2elBzPLg,714079,719600,we all jumped in and then set on the  steps  the water was at chest level
iOv2elBzPLg,719600,726240,we just sat there and occasionally  getting out of water and jumping in the  middle of the pool
iOv2elBzPLg,726240,733200,we noticed that the red color was  missing in the color rounds because we  kept seeing orange pink and purple
iOv2elBzPLg,733200,739920,but no red  a few minutes later when we pointed out  the fact that there was no red
iOv2elBzPLg,739920,747839,the colors  randomly turned into red and that's when  i looked over the backyard fence
iOv2elBzPLg,747839,754880,what i saw sent chills down my spine  there were two beady yellow eyes
iOv2elBzPLg,754880,761279,that made me feel like it was looking  through my soul  carly and jenny didn't seem to notice
iOv2elBzPLg,761279,767040,the eyes  because they were too busy freaking out  about the freakish red color in the pool
iOv2elBzPLg,767040,773680,we all decided that it was time we went  inside  so we got out of the pool and grabbed
iOv2elBzPLg,773680,780880,our towels  we stood in the front of the backyard  door  drying ourselves while talking
iOv2elBzPLg,780880,786959,i told them about the yellow eyes i saw  and how it scared me  they all laughed and told me to stop
iOv2elBzPLg,786959,792079,trying to scare them  i got annoyed because they were  dismissing something that clearly
iOv2elBzPLg,792079,798720,bothered me  but i just brushed it off  so i didn't ruin the night
iOv2elBzPLg,798720,804959,we went back inside and took turns  taking a shower  later that night we were all in carly's
iOv2elBzPLg,804959,810720,room joking around while watching a  movie  i needed to use the bathroom so i
iOv2elBzPLg,810720,815920,excused myself and went out of the room  i was walking around trying to find a
iOv2elBzPLg,815920,822160,bathroom since i was not familiar with  the house yet  i reached the hallway that had an open
iOv2elBzPLg,822160,827680,window  i even for some reason looked outside
iOv2elBzPLg,827680,833199,all i saw were the same yellow eyes  staring back at me
iOv2elBzPLg,833199,839199,i freaked out and ran back to carly's  room  but i decided not to tell them because i
iOv2elBzPLg,839199,845920,just knew they wouldn't believe me  around 12 pm we decided to go to sleep
iOv2elBzPLg,845920,851760,i closed my eyes and fell asleep  but i got a nightmare about those yellow
iOv2elBzPLg,851760,859120,eyes  i joked awake  i was just curious on who owned them
iOv2elBzPLg,859120,865680,i walked to the window where i saw the  eyes and  you can guess what happened
iOv2elBzPLg,865680,872399,the eyes were  gone  got a little scared so i went back and
iOv2elBzPLg,872399,878079,decided to just sleep it off i laid down  on the blankets that we laid out
iOv2elBzPLg,878079,885040,i was facing carly's closet  and i noticed that the closet was  cracked open
iOv2elBzPLg,885040,891680,i tried to adjust my eyes to the  darkness of the room  but it wasn't working
iOv2elBzPLg,891680,897279,i noticed that there was something  yellow in the closet
iOv2elBzPLg,897519,902880,and that made me think about the yellow  eyes  i got up quietly
iOv2elBzPLg,902880,908639,so i didn't wake carly and jenny up  i opened the closet and
iOv2elBzPLg,908639,914240,and a man with scruffy hair and dirty  clothes jump at me i noticed
iOv2elBzPLg,914240,919360,he had bright yellow eyes  and i realized that it was him that i
iOv2elBzPLg,919360,926079,saw  i blacked out  and woke up in the hospital
iOv2elBzPLg,926079,933120,i was confused  so i asked jenny who was next to me  on what had happened
iOv2elBzPLg,933120,938639,she told me that they woke up to me  screaming while looking at the closet
iOv2elBzPLg,938639,943759,and saw me passing out on the floor  i told her that there was a man
iOv2elBzPLg,943759,949120,but she just said that there was no one  else there but me carly and her
iOv2elBzPLg,949120,955759,apparently i had a heart attack due to  shock to this day
iOv2elBzPLg,955759,961839,i still don't know what happened  and who or or what
iOv2elBzPLg,961839,965240,attacked me
iOv2elBzPLg,968140,974720,[Music]  this is mina hill from pakistan  and i'm a very big fan of horror stories
iOv2elBzPLg,974720,979839,that are animated by wanzi i want to  share some stories from my side and of
iOv2elBzPLg,979839,986480,course  it's a true story  it happened back when i was a high  school student in oman at the time my
iOv2elBzPLg,986480,991759,family was back in pakistan and my  father and i lived in oman our house was
iOv2elBzPLg,991759,999199,situated deep inside of short streets  and there was a big old bushy tree in  front of my house it was a two-story
iOv2elBzPLg,999199,1005199,house  and two families were residing on each  floor  my father and i used to live on the
iOv2elBzPLg,1005199,1012800,ground floor when i came back from  college i used to be alone at home until  my father came back i wasn't lonely
iOv2elBzPLg,1012800,1019279,though i had two pet rabbits  one day  i came home from college and the entire
iOv2elBzPLg,1019279,1024959,house was messed up  despite being tired i knew i had to get  it cleaned up
iOv2elBzPLg,1024959,1031280,i probably got finished with that in the  rest of my chores around 9 00 pm  being tired when i went in i was
iOv2elBzPLg,1031280,1038319,extremely tired by this point so i went  to my room to rest and wait for my  father to get home i put my right arm
iOv2elBzPLg,1038319,1045038,over my eyes and tried to relax  it wasn't long before i felt something  jump over my legs and
iOv2elBzPLg,1045038,1051360,it felt like it was heavy i left my  rabbits to roam free in the lounge and i  figured it must have been one of them
iOv2elBzPLg,1051360,1057039,however slowly  the weight  started coming up to my stomach and then
iOv2elBzPLg,1057039,1064000,up to my chest  it was the most horrible feeling i  opened my eyes and looked around but
iOv2elBzPLg,1064000,1072240,there was nothing there  i again closed my eyes and laid straight  with just my eyes closed suddenly i felt
iOv2elBzPLg,1072240,1077280,the weight on my arms as if they were  being pinned down by somebody's legs and
iOv2elBzPLg,1077280,1082640,began to feel a pressure on my neck like  i was being choked i couldn't see anyone
iOv2elBzPLg,1082640,1087679,but it was just like  an entity was attacking me i was in so
iOv2elBzPLg,1087679,1093600,much pain i couldn't move or say  anything and tears were rolling down my  eyes
iOv2elBzPLg,1093600,1101679,tears of fear and pain  not knowing what else to do  i prayed to god and i swear god answered
iOv2elBzPLg,1101679,1108480,i heard the main door open and somebody  stepped in it was my father and he was  calling my name while he was looking for
iOv2elBzPLg,1108480,1113600,me he happened to come by my room and he  entered he saw me lying on the bed in
iOv2elBzPLg,1113600,1119919,the dark and he turned on the light  and the sight of me had him almost as  frightened as i was
iOv2elBzPLg,1119919,1127200,my eyes were opened wide and red  i was drenched in sweat even though the  air conditioner was turned on my body
iOv2elBzPLg,1127200,1133840,was shaking the moment he turned on the  light  all of the weight from my body was gone
iOv2elBzPLg,1133840,1140320,and i was relieved my father came to me  and asked me what happened  i couldn't speak for a half an hour
iOv2elBzPLg,1140320,1145360,before i finally came back to my senses  i explained to my father what happened
iOv2elBzPLg,1145360,1151440,that i thought i'd almost died  after that day  many strange things started to happen
iOv2elBzPLg,1151440,1158000,around the house the bathroom faucets  would turn on on their own  dishes in the kitchen would fall despite
iOv2elBzPLg,1158000,1165600,nobody being in the room and my rabbits  started reacting like they were being  touched or played with by something i
iOv2elBzPLg,1165600,1171840,would lose things and i'd find them out  of nowhere then one day my rabbits  stopped eating
iOv2elBzPLg,1171840,1178960,and they got sick  it was awful as i had to be in that  house by myself all day after months of
iOv2elBzPLg,1178960,1186720,practically begging him  my father and i moved and never went  back to that house again after that
iOv2elBzPLg,1186720,1191760,nothing like that has ever happened to  me again  but i can honestly say
iOv2elBzPLg,1191760,1200679,i have never  been so scared it was the worst  experience of my entire life
iOv2elBzPLg,1208320,1213440,i grew up in a semi-small town by  semi-small i mean it was small enough
iOv2elBzPLg,1213440,1219280,for everyone to know each other we had a  library  and a high school
iOv2elBzPLg,1219280,1226000,in this town there was one specific  alley that led to nowhere  and there was not a single street lamp
iOv2elBzPLg,1226000,1231120,to light it at night  apparently this alley was restricted
iOv2elBzPLg,1231120,1238320,it was a sign of no trespassing and in  general my parents were also very shady  about that
iOv2elBzPLg,1238640,1246000,they told me there is nothing there but  some kind of a warehouse of the city  and i should not think about it too much
iOv2elBzPLg,1246000,1252559,however there was also an urban legend  this was that kind of an urban legend
iOv2elBzPLg,1252559,1259200,that your brother tells you when you're  young and naive  when it is so easy to scare you but he
iOv2elBzPLg,1259200,1264240,still makes the effort to make it up as  a horror story to keep you at night
iOv2elBzPLg,1264240,1270640,i also heard the story for the first  time from my brother kevin  as the story goes
iOv2elBzPLg,1270640,1276559,the warehouse is not a warehouse at all  but is used to be some government
iOv2elBzPLg,1276559,1283280,medical building where human experiments  were carried out  [Music]  later the public found it out and it was
iOv2elBzPLg,1283280,1289679,shut down and we can't go near it  because there's still expensive medical  stuff there  [Music]
iOv2elBzPLg,1289679,1295600,supposedly there is also this creature  that walks the walls of the old building
iOv2elBzPLg,1295600,1302640,and at night  he comes out to eat  when kevin told me this story i was
iOv2elBzPLg,1302640,1308159,eight or so i remember asking him  what does it eat at this point i should
iOv2elBzPLg,1308159,1314240,tell you that  at this time the whole community was  looking  for a lost kid mark
iOv2elBzPLg,1314240,1320400,it was my  classmate  kevin said  well people of course
iOv2elBzPLg,1320400,1326880,what do you think happened to mark  when he said that i started crying so  loud that our parents noticed and came
iOv2elBzPLg,1326880,1333039,upstairs  mark was my friend  and i couldn't bear the thought that he
iOv2elBzPLg,1333039,1339840,was eaten by that thing  my parents were so mad at kevin i  remember my dad even slapped him
iOv2elBzPLg,1339840,1345280,not because he made me cry but  because he dared to talk about the alley
iOv2elBzPLg,1345280,1352240,it was not the last time i heard about  the being in the alley  in fact as time passed it became kind of
iOv2elBzPLg,1352240,1357679,an inside joke between young people  every time some family moved or we
iOv2elBzPLg,1357679,1364480,noticed someone missing from the class  we jokingly said  probably the being in the alley got him
iOv2elBzPLg,1364480,1370400,kids love that stuff  adults not so much  even heard about a kid who was suspended
iOv2elBzPLg,1370400,1376159,after he joked about the being before  the  when i became 12 talks about the being
iOv2elBzPLg,1376159,1383600,became subtle because there were also  talks about people vanishing  and it suddenly wasn't that funny
iOv2elBzPLg,1383600,1390000,it was  this older kid  eric hey real bully
iOv2elBzPLg,1390000,1396799,he always walked with these three  henchmen of his  beating up kids  stealing their lunch money
iOv2elBzPLg,1396799,1402559,that sort of stuff  he always got away with it because his  dad was the police chief
iOv2elBzPLg,1402559,1408799,they made me up a lot too  [Music]  even stumped a cigarette on my arm once
iOv2elBzPLg,1408799,1414480,the burn is still visible  long story short i was scared of [ __ ] by
iOv2elBzPLg,1414480,1421520,these bunch among all  by eric  around this time my parents decided i
iOv2elBzPLg,1421520,1428480,should take folk dance classes  yeah  like i was not bullied already
iOv2elBzPLg,1428480,1435200,but anyway the folk dance community was  really nice  made a lot of new friends there
iOv2elBzPLg,1435200,1440240,the problem was that the classes were  late in the afternoon and lasted till
iOv2elBzPLg,1440240,1445440,the evening  but of course my parents always pick me  up as soon as possible
iOv2elBzPLg,1445440,1452880,on one evening my dad was supposed to  pick me up but he didn't  literally told me he simply forgot but i
iOv2elBzPLg,1452880,1458799,know he was out there drinking so i  decided to walk home alone  it was around 8pm
iOv2elBzPLg,1458799,1465919,so it was already getting dark the  streetlights were on so i didn't worry  as i turned the corner i noticed a group
iOv2elBzPLg,1465919,1473120,of older boys was fooling around on the  street  of course it was eric and his gang
iOv2elBzPLg,1473120,1478880,i tried to walk past them while keeping  a distance if possible  eric had a handcuff
iOv2elBzPLg,1478880,1484960,probably from the chief  and he handcuffed one of his goons to a  street lamp as a joke
iOv2elBzPLg,1484960,1490559,i tried to be as invisible as i could  but just my luck they noticed me
iOv2elBzPLg,1490559,1497279,look who's here said eric get him he  screamed  and two boys ran towards me
iOv2elBzPLg,1497279,1503600,i tried to fight them but come on i was  outnumbered  eric threw the cigarette on the ground
iOv2elBzPLg,1503600,1510000,and stepped on it  then he released his friend the one  handcuffed to the lamp
iOv2elBzPLg,1510000,1516480,they started to walk towards me and eric  started to speak well i'm glad you came  you're in luck you can finally meet the
iOv2elBzPLg,1516480,1523760,fifth member of the team  he started laughing and two boys grabbed  and dragged me where are you taking me i
iOv2elBzPLg,1523760,1529039,asked patience said eric we went past  one street and the other
iOv2elBzPLg,1529039,1534960,and finally  we've arrived at our destination  yeah
iOv2elBzPLg,1534960,1541440,it was that damned alley  as i mentioned before there was no  streetlights
iOv2elBzPLg,1541440,1548480,but complete darkness  as we passed the no trespassing sign
iOv2elBzPLg,1548480,1555600,i started rationalizing things  there's no way that story's true it's  it's an urban myth it's made up they
iOv2elBzPLg,1555600,1560720,just want to scare me they're going to  beat me up and then leave me alone i  told myself
iOv2elBzPLg,1560720,1568400,we reached the end of the alley  at this point my eyes got used to the  dark so i could see most things
iOv2elBzPLg,1568400,1575120,there was a pole on one side of the  alley and a door on the other  then those jerks handcuffed me to the
iOv2elBzPLg,1575120,1582840,pole so i couldn't run away  i told him this was not funny  then eric said well you're right it's
iOv2elBzPLg,1582840,1588960,not not yet anyways  as he said that he took a key out of his  pocket and then
iOv2elBzPLg,1588960,1595360,opened the door and knocked twice on it  what happened next i  i never forget
iOv2elBzPLg,1595360,1600880,the boys along with eric started running  away while laughing uncontrollably
iOv2elBzPLg,1600880,1608159,all i could see in the building was  darkness  then a form started to slowly emerge
iOv2elBzPLg,1608159,1613279,it was quite reputable  first i thought it was a large dog but
iOv2elBzPLg,1613279,1620799,as it moved  it became much clearer  hairless thing with a really long neck
iOv2elBzPLg,1620799,1627360,like a like a goose or something  i could see his spine his head
iOv2elBzPLg,1627360,1634880,pointed towards the ground  what it did i i wouldn't call walking  but an increasingly fast crawling
iOv2elBzPLg,1634880,1640880,when it reached the door  he lifted its head  i was freaked out
iOv2elBzPLg,1640880,1646080,nothing said was somewhat human looking  although it missed the nose but had a
iOv2elBzPLg,1646080,1653039,hole in that place  and was full of scars  and its eyes  those were human eyes
iOv2elBzPLg,1653039,1658320,its body was like that of a quadrupedal  human  between its legs there was nothing but a
iOv2elBzPLg,1658320,1664159,wound its hands were missing the thumbs  looked like paws
iOv2elBzPLg,1664159,1669600,it stopped and sniffed the air  then started punting like a dog
iOv2elBzPLg,1669600,1676559,it didn't look straight at me but was  looking all around me  then  we made eye contact
iOv2elBzPLg,1676559,1682720,noticed me  his jaw started opening much larger than  a human possibly could i noticed that
iOv2elBzPLg,1682720,1692679,its teeth were also much sharper  as it opened its mouth  i heard the most terrifying scream
iOv2elBzPLg,1698320,1703679,i started crying and moving all around  then the thing run towards me and bit my
iOv2elBzPLg,1703679,1709360,leg with my other leg i managed to kick  the beast  which annoyed him enough to let my feet  go
iOv2elBzPLg,1709360,1715919,as it would jump on me i managed to pull  the pole out of the ground and  accidentally hit the creature with it
iOv2elBzPLg,1715919,1721279,that animal must have noticed that i  released myself  because it ran straight back to the
iOv2elBzPLg,1721279,1726640,building  i didn't think much  and run back home immediately
iOv2elBzPLg,1726640,1734159,didn't look back either  years passed since then  i didn't tell anyone about what happened
iOv2elBzPLg,1734159,1741840,the police chief had a fatal stroke a  year ago  and suddenly eric wasn't so untouchable
iOv2elBzPLg,1741840,1748080,hurdy went straight to prison when he  was caught beating up one of his goons  he deserves it
iOv2elBzPLg,1748080,1756480,that guy is a psychopath  and that thing  i don't even want to think about it
iOv2elBzPLg,1756510,1759690,[Applause]
iOv2elBzPLg,1763039,1769600,this happened to me  12 years ago  i was in ss2 which was a class before
iOv2elBzPLg,1769600,1776080,the exam  i was a border at the time  and i occupied the top bunk bed
iOv2elBzPLg,1776080,1781360,one night while sleeping i woke up and  tried to turn but i noticed i was not on
iOv2elBzPLg,1781360,1786399,my bed but  on the floor  how i had gotten there i
iOv2elBzPLg,1786399,1794240,i couldn't tell  my bed was positioned to the window so  my head naturally was in that direction
iOv2elBzPLg,1794240,1799520,even if i had changed my head's position  that night it didn't really explain how  i woke up
iOv2elBzPLg,1799520,1806159,my bed was opposite the door of our dorm  and the window was behind my head  but i was at the foot of my bed and i
iOv2elBzPLg,1806159,1812159,was a few centimeters away from the bunk  i struggled to get on the bed feeling  woozy
iOv2elBzPLg,1812159,1817440,and my head felt heavy  by the morning i found i had a bump on  my head
iOv2elBzPLg,1817440,1822480,chipped the tooth and had a bruise on my  ankle i also developed a black eye after
iOv2elBzPLg,1822480,1827919,a few days  a student mentioned that she heard  something full but
iOv2elBzPLg,1827919,1835120,thought it was a box  it took me years to realize that i had  maybe passed out due to a fall and found
iOv2elBzPLg,1835120,1841600,myself on the floor when i woke up  what actually scared me was that i  thought i was probably dragged out of
iOv2elBzPLg,1841600,1848080,bed by a man we named man in black  who terrorized us then  story has it
iOv2elBzPLg,1848080,1853520,he came to rape and assault the students  nothing i could think of explained my
iOv2elBzPLg,1853520,1859440,fault and the position i was in  i didn't suspect any physical assault  either
iOv2elBzPLg,1859440,1865440,i often think of that moment and i thank  god that i'm alive  to this day
iOv2elBzPLg,1865440,1871840,i still wonder what led up to that  incident  and i dread what would have happened if
iOv2elBzPLg,1871840,1875799,if i didn't wake up
iOv2elBzPLg,1889039,1894480,the story is about my mom's recent  ex-husband  it happened recently and it happened
iOv2elBzPLg,1894480,1901360,over the span of a couple of years my  mom still doesn't want to really admit  how bad the situation really was but
iOv2elBzPLg,1901360,1906720,she's probably still in a little bit of  denial from it  she met this guy that i'll call joe when
iOv2elBzPLg,1906720,1913919,i was five years old we had just moved  to indiana and she was still with my dad  but they had split up shortly after and
iOv2elBzPLg,1913919,1919760,then her and joe started dating  we moved to florida to live with my  grandparents for a few years but they
iOv2elBzPLg,1919760,1925360,still kept talking  fast forward a few years and i'm now  around 14.
iOv2elBzPLg,1925360,1931120,i also have a sister and she's six years  younger than me  she was also heavily affected by what
iOv2elBzPLg,1931120,1938240,happened as she had to witness  everything firsthand  anyways  fast forward a few years and joe and my
iOv2elBzPLg,1938240,1944640,mom started seriously dating again and  they wanted to get married  i always got really bad vibes from him
iOv2elBzPLg,1944640,1949840,and i tried telling my mom but she  didn't listen joe was a smoker and my
iOv2elBzPLg,1949840,1955440,mom hated it  he also used to have a drinking problem  but my mom didn't really know just how
iOv2elBzPLg,1955440,1961840,bad it was until after they got married  i went to go live with my older sister  for a few months for reasons i don't
iOv2elBzPLg,1961840,1968799,want to disclose but my mom and joe got  married during those few months  when i went back to living with my mom
iOv2elBzPLg,1968799,1975519,joe was now living with us  we had a small two-bedroom house and me  and my sister had to share a room but my
iOv2elBzPLg,1975519,1981279,sister would still sleep in my mom's  room because she was scared of the dark  so she was sleeping in the same room as
iOv2elBzPLg,1981279,1987360,joe too  now  i'm gonna go ahead and explain all the  messy [ __ ] that happened
iOv2elBzPLg,1987360,1993600,joe started drinking again  he would be drunk all the time and he  would steal my mom's money for beer
iOv2elBzPLg,1993600,2000240,my mom tried to send him to rehab a  couple times but it didn't work  when joe finally got a job again after
iOv2elBzPLg,2000240,2006000,being fired from his last job  he would hide money and he wouldn't help  my mom with the bills
iOv2elBzPLg,2006000,2011440,they were married now so i mean it only  made sense that they would both pay the  bills and stuff
iOv2elBzPLg,2011440,2019120,my mom and him would constantly find  about money him drinking and sneaking  off to buy beer and stealing etc
iOv2elBzPLg,2019120,2024799,it was pretty traumatic to hear them  fight almost every night and i felt  really bad for my sister having to hear
iOv2elBzPLg,2024799,2031279,it too  joe would hide his car keys to hide  stuff in his car and my mom once found  weed in there
iOv2elBzPLg,2031279,2036960,joe once even stole money from my little  sister for whatever he needed  he would also get the only most
iOv2elBzPLg,2036960,2042720,expensive gas for his car so he needed  hundreds of dollars every month for my  mom for that
iOv2elBzPLg,2042720,2048720,when he got fired from his first job he  had just sold his gun  and it's a good thing he did because he
iOv2elBzPLg,2048720,2054000,went to his boss and my mom believes  that he would have tried to kill her if  he still had his gun
iOv2elBzPLg,2054000,2060480,anyways my mom kicked him out several  times but always brought him back even  though me and my sister always begged
iOv2elBzPLg,2060480,2065679,her not to  at one point he bribed us with apple  watches which didn't really make us hate
iOv2elBzPLg,2065679,2071280,him any less by the way  and at one point he was drunk in bed  saying he was going to kill himself and
iOv2elBzPLg,2071280,2077200,my mom told me to call  911 my sister was in the room while  everything happened
iOv2elBzPLg,2077200,2083040,joe had even cheated on my mom during  one of the times she kicked him out  my mom finally kicked him out for good
iOv2elBzPLg,2083040,2089440,after a couple of years and he went back  to the woman he cheated with  that's when the phone calls emails texts
iOv2elBzPLg,2089440,2095919,and even the threats all begin  they would constantly call us and text  us blaming my mom for everything that
iOv2elBzPLg,2095919,2102560,happened and saying really terrible  things about her and making up lies  he was always drunk whenever he would
iOv2elBzPLg,2102560,2107920,call  one time his new girlfriend even  threatened to cut my mom's throat
iOv2elBzPLg,2107920,2113599,that was the final straw and when we  decided to call the cops  they couldn't really do anything about
iOv2elBzPLg,2113599,2119520,it though  the calls in the text wouldn't stop  my mom kept getting emails up until a
iOv2elBzPLg,2119520,2126320,few months ago  i'm 17 years old now and me and my  sister are still really traumatized it
iOv2elBzPLg,2126320,2133200,felt like my mom chose him over us and  i'm still really hurt over it  but i really just hope to never see joe
iOv2elBzPLg,2133200,2135520,again
iOv2elBzPLg,2141599,2146800,my name is mia and i was 11 years old  when this story took place my mom worked
iOv2elBzPLg,2146800,2152000,three jobs so i would often be left home  alone with my mama and papa
iOv2elBzPLg,2152000,2158960,one day my mom brought this old antique  clock home from work because they were  just gonna throw it out
iOv2elBzPLg,2158960,2164320,it was one of those clocks where you had  to have a special key and twist it for
iOv2elBzPLg,2164320,2170960,however many days you wanted it to go  off  my mom had set the clock to go off at  six o'clock every morning and every
iOv2elBzPLg,2170960,2176800,night she figured it would help me wake  up for school in the morning because it  was so loud
iOv2elBzPLg,2176800,2182000,but soon summer break came so we didn't  have a reason to wind it up anymore
iOv2elBzPLg,2182000,2188560,one night i got up around three in the  morning to get a glass of water  once i got my glass of water i looked
iOv2elBzPLg,2188560,2194320,down the hallway to see somebody walking  into the bathroom  i assumed it was either my mother or one
iOv2elBzPLg,2194320,2201520,of my grandparents so i went back to bed  the next night  the clock went off at 3 am
iOv2elBzPLg,2201520,2209280,i was confused as to why it was going  off at 3 a.m because i hadn't touched it  i couldn't have i'm simply too short to
iOv2elBzPLg,2209280,2216640,reach it and i didn't think my mom would  wind it up at 3am  the scary thing about it was i would see
iOv2elBzPLg,2216640,2223760,a dark shadow in the corner every night  standing in front of my closet  at first i was afraid of it but i soon
iOv2elBzPLg,2223760,2229680,got used to it because i just assumed it  was my imagination so i would just  ignore it and lay back down and try to
iOv2elBzPLg,2229680,2236400,go back to sleep  one night the clock went off the usual  time but there was something off about
iOv2elBzPLg,2236400,2243440,this particular night  first off it was super cold  which was odd because it was always warm
iOv2elBzPLg,2243440,2248880,in my room especially in the summer  second i was laying on my left side and
iOv2elBzPLg,2248880,2254000,i always sleep on my right  and third i was wide awake
iOv2elBzPLg,2254000,2259280,i just brushed it off and rolled over  but as soon as i did  i felt my heart stop
iOv2elBzPLg,2259280,2264800,because what i saw next  scared me for life  i saw a face
iOv2elBzPLg,2264800,2270560,looking at me with ruby red eyes and  long fingers rested on my bed i screamed
iOv2elBzPLg,2270560,2276800,and kicked and ran to the living room  crying  once i got to the light switch at the  other end of the hallway i looked behind
iOv2elBzPLg,2276800,2282839,me and at the end of the hallway i saw  the silhouette of a man who had to be  about seven feet
iOv2elBzPLg,2282839,2290560,tall i turned on the light and it  disappeared but as soon as i did  i got a horrible nosebleed
iOv2elBzPLg,2290560,2296160,the next morning i thought i would clean  my room because my mom would be mad if i  didn't even though i was scared because
iOv2elBzPLg,2296160,2302079,of what happened the night before i was  more afraid of my mom scolding me about  a messy room
iOv2elBzPLg,2302079,2308880,so i put my hair in a ponytail  put in my headphones and started  cleaning it wasn't long before i felt
iOv2elBzPLg,2308880,2315440,somebody tug on my hair  enough to pull my head back i assumed it  was my mom trying to get my attention so
iOv2elBzPLg,2315440,2321760,i took my headphones out  turned around only to see the glass of  water on my nightstand
iOv2elBzPLg,2321760,2328160,fly across the room and hit the mirror  behind my door  i finally had enough and told my mom
iOv2elBzPLg,2328160,2334960,she decided to get some sage and saged  me and our entire house  she also poured some salt in front of
iOv2elBzPLg,2334960,2340079,all of the windows and doors  the next morning when my mom and i woke
iOv2elBzPLg,2340079,2345359,up all of the windows and doors were  open  along with the cabinets and all the
iOv2elBzPLg,2345359,2350960,water running in both the kitchen and  the bathroom sinks  when we went outside one of our pet
iOv2elBzPLg,2350960,2356960,ducks was missing and my chicken root  was dead  that day the clock fell off the wall and
iOv2elBzPLg,2356960,2364320,the place where you put the key broke so  you can't wind it up anymore  i'm now 16 years old and i no longer
iOv2elBzPLg,2364320,2370000,live in that house but  every now and then i'll see the shadows  i've never been much of a religious
iOv2elBzPLg,2370000,2376480,person but i always carry a cross due to  this incident  and that clock
iOv2elBzPLg,2376480,2381540,still remains in that house to this very  day
iOv2elBzPLg,2381540,2388079,[Music]  i wanted to tell you the story of a  friend of mine named angel
iOv2elBzPLg,2388079,2393599,angel is 19 and was honestly one of the  brightest cleverest most bubbly people  i've ever met
iOv2elBzPLg,2393599,2399599,she was obsessed with true crime stuff  and would have loved your channel if  she'd ever had a chance to see your  videos
iOv2elBzPLg,2399599,2407599,she loved that tv program csi and wanted  to join the police so that she could get  into the forensic side of investigations
iOv2elBzPLg,2407599,2413280,she loved the idea of using science to  catch horrible criminals but we never  thought that she'd end up being the
iOv2elBzPLg,2413280,2420560,victim of one  she had everything going for her in life  but then she met her ex-boyfriend che
iOv2elBzPLg,2420560,2427520,and we all saw a change in her  jay made everything about him and he  abused angel physically and mentally
iOv2elBzPLg,2427520,2432880,until she made everything about him too  she was miserable with him but kept
iOv2elBzPLg,2432880,2439040,talking like he was just a tortured soul  who needed a girl like her in his life  to help fix him
iOv2elBzPLg,2439040,2444400,we had to intervene time and time again  to get her to see that he was a scumbag  who'd
iOv2elBzPLg,2444400,2451760,never be any good for anyone as he was  only ever interested in himself  and it took ages to do it but we finally
iOv2elBzPLg,2451760,2457839,managed to convince her to leave him  she told us all in a group chat that  she'd finally told him that they
iOv2elBzPLg,2457839,2463599,couldn't be together anymore and we were  all so proud of her  but she also said that she was terrified
iOv2elBzPLg,2463599,2469040,of something he'd do to get back at her  for it  and as much as we knew that her dad
iOv2elBzPLg,2469040,2475520,patty  would never let anything happen her  while she was under his roof  we knew he couldn't protect her all the
iOv2elBzPLg,2475520,2481200,time  we also knew that che was absolutely  terrified of patty as they'd almost
iOv2elBzPLg,2481200,2487440,gotten into fights a few times before  and patty is well bigger than che and  could beat the life out of him if it
iOv2elBzPLg,2487440,2493760,came to it so he always stayed away from  the house just  not far enough
iOv2elBzPLg,2493760,2500480,i remember the day we found out that  angel was in the hospital and we were  all hoping it wasn't anything serious
iOv2elBzPLg,2500480,2506240,but then we heard that she'd been hurt  in a serious incident  and that she'd somehow fallen out of the
iOv2elBzPLg,2506240,2511520,van that was going down the highway and  we just knew that che had something to  do with it
iOv2elBzPLg,2511520,2516880,as it turns out  jay got in the help of one of his  friends and they'd waited in a van near
iOv2elBzPLg,2516880,2522400,angel's house waiting for her to come  out  when they spotted her  jay ran out
iOv2elBzPLg,2522400,2527440,picked her up and basically carried her  to the van and threw her into the back  of it
iOv2elBzPLg,2527440,2532640,we still don't know exactly what went on  inside the van  mache insisted in court that he didn't
iOv2elBzPLg,2532640,2539520,just throw her out of it  but whatever he was doing or saying it  scared angels so much that she somehow
iOv2elBzPLg,2539520,2544960,found a way to open the back doors as it  was traveling down the highway  and she must have thought her only
iOv2elBzPLg,2544960,2551200,chance at survival was jumping out the  back of the van  some people think jay pushed her out of
iOv2elBzPLg,2551200,2556319,the back as a way to kill her but at his  trial his lawyers were somehow able to
iOv2elBzPLg,2556319,2562160,prove that jay hadn't pushed her and all  he wanted to do was keep her inside the  van
iOv2elBzPLg,2562160,2568720,he must have admitted to just wanting to  kidnap and scare her into getting back  with him  but i know angel wouldn't have done
iOv2elBzPLg,2568720,2574560,anything so drastic without being scared  for her life  what happened next makes it clear to me
iOv2elBzPLg,2574560,2580880,that the justice system in this country  is just completely broken because the  sentence che got was nothing on what he
iOv2elBzPLg,2580880,2587040,deserved to get  he recently got his sentence more than  doubled after this big public campaign
iOv2elBzPLg,2587040,2593359,headed up by her parents  which is all good and everything but it  still feels like nothing because angel's
iOv2elBzPLg,2593359,2600000,life is basically over now  she suffered serious head trauma after  falling or being pushed from the back of
iOv2elBzPLg,2600000,2605680,the van  and now the doctors think that she's  going to be  potentially disabled for the rest of her
iOv2elBzPLg,2605680,2611520,life  we don't know if she's ever going to  walk talk or eat by herself ever again
iOv2elBzPLg,2611520,2616720,it's basically a death sentence  but the sentence che was originally  going to get
iOv2elBzPLg,2616720,2623599,was just over four years  can you even believe that  a guy kidnaps his ex-girlfriend he might
iOv2elBzPLg,2623599,2630160,have actually thrown her out the back of  the van going at 60 miles an hour her  life is now basically over and he was
iOv2elBzPLg,2630160,2635680,probably gonna get out of prison  after four years that's nothing
iOv2elBzPLg,2635680,2642240,he deserves to be in prison for the rest  of his life  the driver of the van got next to  nothing too and he also deserves to be
iOv2elBzPLg,2642240,2648480,in prison for the rest of his life  angel once told me about a law in  america where if someone dies while
iOv2elBzPLg,2648480,2654560,you're committing a crime your charge  automatically gets turned into murder  and i think we should have one here like
iOv2elBzPLg,2654560,2659839,that too  they would make people think twice about  doing things like kidnapping or drunk
iOv2elBzPLg,2659839,2665520,driving or anything that could end up  ruining someone's life  sorry if this seemed to get a bit
iOv2elBzPLg,2665520,2671440,emotional or wasn't the best written  story you've been sent  i got a bit upset writing it because
iOv2elBzPLg,2671440,2676640,it's still all so raw for us all  this all happened almost two years ago
iOv2elBzPLg,2676640,2681839,now but it honestly feels like yesterday  that we found out that angel's life was  over
iOv2elBzPLg,2681839,2688640,i hope you read this out in one of your  videos so that more people know what a  rotten scumbag che beau skill is
iOv2elBzPLg,2688640,2694640,he deserves to be the one lying in a  hospital bed not able to move  not angel
iOv2elBzPLg,2694640,2700960,i mean he actually laughed during the  court case  how can you even do that  how evil do you have to be to hear
iOv2elBzPLg,2700960,2707359,someone talking about how you took a  girl's life away  and then just laugh about it
iOv2elBzPLg,2707359,2713200,please read this out so more people hear  about angel's story  people need to know that if a guy is a
iOv2elBzPLg,2713200,2720640,psycho it's not up to them to fix him or  help him because they'll just end up
iOv2elBzPLg,2720640,2726640,as a victim  my name is eddie
iOv2elBzPLg,2726640,2732990,and i live in texas  this happened when i was 16 years old
iOv2elBzPLg,2732990,2739839,[Music]  my mom and dad both are business people  one day they had to go to india for
iOv2elBzPLg,2739839,2746079,business reasons  they were to stay there for five days
iOv2elBzPLg,2746079,2751440,i was so happy that i would be home  alone  they told me to go with them but
iOv2elBzPLg,2751440,2756880,i didn't  first day i was having so much fun
iOv2elBzPLg,2756880,2763760,i called my friends told them to stay  with me for five days  they all came to my house and we were
iOv2elBzPLg,2763760,2769280,having a great time  on the second day  one of my friends said
iOv2elBzPLg,2769280,2774560,hey we should play hide and seek  our house have a big backyard so we all
iOv2elBzPLg,2774560,2781040,agreed  i was the one who was supposed to find  them first  i found everyone except one of my
iOv2elBzPLg,2781040,2786800,friends  he was 17 years old and he was very  courageous
iOv2elBzPLg,2786800,2793599,so he went to the darkest side  we all guessed that he probably went  there so we did too
iOv2elBzPLg,2793599,2801119,but when we got closer we  saw a man  with a big knife
iOv2elBzPLg,2801119,2806640,cutting him  we were all shocked
iOv2elBzPLg,2806640,2813680,one of my friends ran then  and then we all did  he saw us and followed us
iOv2elBzPLg,2813680,2820000,we came back to the house and locked the  doors  and then we called the police
iOv2elBzPLg,2820000,2825119,when they arrived  the man was  gone
iOv2elBzPLg,2825119,2831680,the police took my friend's dead body  and my parents came back the day after
iOv2elBzPLg,2831680,2838920,since then  i can't stay at home without my parents
iOv2elBzPLg,2846160,2852800,back when i first moved away for college  my mom and dad bought me this beat up  old toyota matrix so i could drive home
iOv2elBzPLg,2852800,2859359,whenever i'd wanted  i grew to hate the old piece of trash  after a while but it got me from point a
iOv2elBzPLg,2859359,2864400,to b and it helped me get a job as a  delivery driver for a pizza place
iOv2elBzPLg,2864400,2872319,so i'll always appreciate the gesture  but then one night when i was making a  delivery something happened that meant
iOv2elBzPLg,2872319,2878400,that from that night on i never got into  the driver's seat of it  ever again
iOv2elBzPLg,2878400,2885520,so like i said i'm making deliveries one  night and i just gotten back into my car  after dropping off a bunch of pizzas in
iOv2elBzPLg,2885520,2891200,an apartment building  when i suddenly realized i hadn't locked  the passenger side door
iOv2elBzPLg,2891200,2899200,and the only reason i realized i hadn't  locked the door was because this guy  opens up the door and climbs into my car
iOv2elBzPLg,2899200,2904880,then right as i'm about to tell the guy  to get out  i see he has a gun
iOv2elBzPLg,2904880,2910240,i'm too scared to even say anything and  he just points it right in my face and  says all out of breath
iOv2elBzPLg,2910240,2916160,drive  as i'm pulling into the street literally  trembling in my seat
iOv2elBzPLg,2916160,2922000,i see these two cops sprinting out of an  alley in my rear view  and that's when it hits me that they
iOv2elBzPLg,2922000,2927680,were probably chasing him and they  probably had enough time to call in my  license plate
iOv2elBzPLg,2927680,2934079,turns out i was dead right about that  because the next thing i know i see  flashing lights in the rear view
iOv2elBzPLg,2934079,2940640,i didn't even have to look over at the  guy i just see him race the gun up  pointing it at me and he says
iOv2elBzPLg,2940640,2946079,if you stop this car i'll blow your head  off  so i drove
iOv2elBzPLg,2946079,2951839,and drove and kept driving until we were  out in the suburbs  the whole time the cops are tailing and
iOv2elBzPLg,2951839,2957280,they're not shouting like pull over or  whatever through their bull horns or  whatever you call it
iOv2elBzPLg,2957280,2962800,and i figured it's because they know  that the guy basically carjacked me and  that there's a hostage situation going
iOv2elBzPLg,2962800,2969599,on  the whole time the guy's like drive  faster  and all i can say is i can't this
iOv2elBzPLg,2969599,2974960,thing's a piece of trash if i put my  foot down the engine might freaking give  out
iOv2elBzPLg,2974960,2981359,so he's content to just delay the  inevitable for as long as he could  i don't know exactly how long we were
iOv2elBzPLg,2981359,2987200,driving because the little digital clock  was busted  but after a while we started to see
iOv2elBzPLg,2987200,2992640,fields and stuff  then my gas light starts blinking  and i tell the guy that if we don't at
iOv2elBzPLg,2992640,2998480,least try and stop for gas then we were  eventually just going to come to a  rolling stop
iOv2elBzPLg,2998480,3003839,he tells me to stop at the next gas  station we see so that's exactly what i  do
iOv2elBzPLg,3003839,3009280,but not before the guy uses his phone to  call 9-1-1  telling the operator exactly what's
iOv2elBzPLg,3009280,3015119,going on  and to tell cops that if they come near  the car while we're topping up our gas
iOv2elBzPLg,3015119,3021920,he's going to kill the hostage  i.e  me  we eventually pull into this gas station
iOv2elBzPLg,3021920,3027440,in the middle of nowhere and i'm  absolutely terrified  but i ask him if he wants me to
iOv2elBzPLg,3027440,3034400,get out to top off the tank  he looks around and sees it's one of  those pumps that stays locked unless you
iOv2elBzPLg,3034400,3042640,pay first so he says no  but he has to think something out before  he lets me get out of the car
iOv2elBzPLg,3042640,3048079,the cops are keeping a safe distance  while this is going on as they obviously  thought the guy was straight up ready to
iOv2elBzPLg,3048079,3053200,kill me  and i'd be lying if i said i didn't  think that too
iOv2elBzPLg,3053200,3058240,the whole time they're shouting over  their mics like let the hostage go we
iOv2elBzPLg,3058240,3064640,can work something out  and  no one has to die over this malcolm  just surrender
iOv2elBzPLg,3064640,3070880,and we'll get you help  he's stalling the whole time pointing  the gun to my head every so often to
iOv2elBzPLg,3070880,3076000,warn the cops off and  i swear that every time he did it i  thought he was going to pull the trigger
iOv2elBzPLg,3076000,3081920,and just end it  but looking back if they did that  the cops would have just swarmed the car
iOv2elBzPLg,3081920,3087280,and shot him more  at least i think they would have anyway
iOv2elBzPLg,3087280,3092480,then there came a point where i could  see that he was trying to work out how  to get out of the mess he'd gotten
iOv2elBzPLg,3092480,3098160,himself into  he knew he couldn't get out of the car  to get the clerk to unlock the pumps as
iOv2elBzPLg,3098160,3104079,they'd ran for cover as soon as they saw  that it was a dangerous situation and  there was no way for him to get their
iOv2elBzPLg,3104079,3110000,attention  then he seemed convinced that if i got  out of the car i'd run off to the cops
iOv2elBzPLg,3110000,3115680,like right away which to be fair was my  number one escape plan at the time
iOv2elBzPLg,3115680,3120720,he asked me how far we go if we just  took off with the gas i had in the tank  and i told him
iOv2elBzPLg,3120720,3126240,about a mile or two not far at all and  he lets out this real deep sigh
iOv2elBzPLg,3126240,3131920,like a balloon deflating or something  which i suppose was exactly what was  happening
iOv2elBzPLg,3131920,3137280,it was all out of ideas  he knew this was the end of it  and right then
iOv2elBzPLg,3137280,3143599,i realized that was the point that he  was at his most dangerous  i was pretty much convinced that i was
iOv2elBzPLg,3143599,3150160,going to die by that point  having gotten it into my head that the  guy was going to just go out in the
iOv2elBzPLg,3150160,3156319,blaze of glory by shooting me and then  unloading the rest of his ammo onto the  cops
iOv2elBzPLg,3156319,3162079,then when i heard him say himself  screw it  and he did something to the gun like
iOv2elBzPLg,3162079,3167839,[ __ ] it or take the safety off  i thought to myself  this is it
iOv2elBzPLg,3167839,3173359,this is how my life ends  in a trashy car with some loser maniac
iOv2elBzPLg,3173359,3180240,i shut my eyes  felt my hands gripping the steering  wheel so hard i could feel it shaking
iOv2elBzPLg,3180240,3185599,and then bang  only a second later instead of feeling
iOv2elBzPLg,3185599,3192160,well  nothing  i found i could open my eyes  but the first thing i saw when i opened
iOv2elBzPLg,3192160,3198720,them was a few specks of blood on the  dash near the passenger side  then when i turned i
iOv2elBzPLg,3198720,3205200,instantly started dry-heaving  because the guy had obviously put the  gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger
iOv2elBzPLg,3205200,3210800,because there was a ton of blood and  chunks of brain matter all over the  ceiling of my car
iOv2elBzPLg,3210800,3216240,i opened up the door and was puking with  my hands raised above my head while i
iOv2elBzPLg,3216240,3221760,heard the cops shout and get down in the  ground  i had to lie in my own puke man
iOv2elBzPLg,3221760,3227760,just lie there while they ran over with  their guns on me just in case i was  somehow in on it
iOv2elBzPLg,3227760,3233440,it sounds crazy but  i really didn't mind  knowing it was all over
iOv2elBzPLg,3233440,3240800,that i was safe  well relatively anyway  it was all gravy by that point
iOv2elBzPLg,3240800,3248720,like i don't even think i can really  describe that kind of relief in actual  words  i literally felt high off of it
iOv2elBzPLg,3248720,3254400,you see and hear about people crying in  the aftermath of stuff like that and i  guess that's just how they deal with the
iOv2elBzPLg,3254400,3260319,emotion  but to me it  kind of felt like i'd won something
iOv2elBzPLg,3260319,3266400,like i beat the carjacker by surviving  or whatever  anyway
iOv2elBzPLg,3266400,3272240,i better sign off before this starts  sounding too abstract but  i can definitely say i wouldn't wish
iOv2elBzPLg,3272240,3278440,that kind of experience on anyone  ever
iOv2elBzPLg,3286240,3292640,i was 13 at the time playing on my  playstation until early hours in the  morning
iOv2elBzPLg,3292640,3299680,it was 3 am  the rain was heavy and it started the  thunder so i looked out my window
iOv2elBzPLg,3299680,3307280,and saw a man  with a hoodie on just looking straight  at my bedroom window i went to my mum
iOv2elBzPLg,3307280,3314640,shaking in fear  but she didn't listen  and just told me to go back to bed
iOv2elBzPLg,3314640,3320880,i walked back into my bedroom and looked  out the window but the man was gone
iOv2elBzPLg,3320880,3327200,the next day i was walking to school and  i heard someone behind me  so i turned around and it was the same
iOv2elBzPLg,3327200,3332960,man that i saw outside my window  before i could even run he grabbed my  shoulder and punched me right in the
iOv2elBzPLg,3332960,3338319,stomach the punch had such an impact  that it winded me
iOv2elBzPLg,3338319,3344640,i couldn't remember what he looked like  only that he was wearing a dark hoodie  with his face covered so when the police
iOv2elBzPLg,3344640,3351920,came there was nothing i could tell them  for the next few days all i could think  about was the hooded man
iOv2elBzPLg,3351920,3357359,wondering if that was going to be the  last time i would see him but  it wasn't
iOv2elBzPLg,3357359,3363440,one day as i sat in my bedroom watching  tv  i got a message on my phone saying
iOv2elBzPLg,3363440,3369680,i am watching you  i looked at the text for a while  wondering who i could speak to
iOv2elBzPLg,3369680,3374799,i couldn't tell my mom  she would just worry  and she was under enough pressure with
iOv2elBzPLg,3374799,3381599,my infant brother matthew  i was in the living room with matthew  watching the tv
iOv2elBzPLg,3381599,3387839,at around 9pm  i saw a face pressed against the window
iOv2elBzPLg,3387839,3394640,it was the hooded man this time his hood  was down  his mouth was stretched open
iOv2elBzPLg,3394640,3399839,he had a scar going right across his eye  and he was dripping with sweat
iOv2elBzPLg,3399839,3405520,i screamed for my mom and she saw the  man at the window  she immediately went to lock the door
iOv2elBzPLg,3405520,3412079,but she was too late  he grabbed my mom by the throat and  lifted her against the wall by her neck
iOv2elBzPLg,3412079,3419359,until she was unconscious  while i was choking my mom it gave me  enough time to hide matthew
iOv2elBzPLg,3419359,3424799,i ran to the kitchen  and grabbed the knife  i confronted the man with the knife in
iOv2elBzPLg,3424799,3430240,my hand  thinking he was going to run away but  instead he just laughed
iOv2elBzPLg,3430240,3435599,and quickly grabbed a knife from my hand  just as he raised the knife towards me
iOv2elBzPLg,3435599,3441200,my mom had gained consciousness and hit  him over the head with one of her  ornaments close by
iOv2elBzPLg,3441200,3447520,me and my mom ran upstairs into her  bedroom and locked the bathroom door  where we called the police
iOv2elBzPLg,3447520,3454720,by the time the police got there the man  was gone  but not only was the man gone
iOv2elBzPLg,3454720,3463040,matthew was too  we told the police the description of  the man  he was about 6'3 with a strong build
iOv2elBzPLg,3463040,3468640,he had blonde hair and big blue eyes  with a huge scar across his eye
iOv2elBzPLg,3468640,3474480,it turned out that the police had  received many phone calls with the same  description all across town
iOv2elBzPLg,3474480,3480559,he had been reported by their citizens  for spying on underage girls and boys
iOv2elBzPLg,3480559,3485680,the police  searched for matthew for weeks after his  kidnapping
iOv2elBzPLg,3485680,3492240,with no witnesses and no leads  the police eventually stopped the search
iOv2elBzPLg,3492240,3497760,we never saw matthew again  his body was never found
iOv2elBzPLg,3497760,3504640,still to this day we don't know if he's  dead or alive  but i hope one day
iOv2elBzPLg,3504640,3507519,we get answers
iOv2elBzPLg,3514000,3519839,for my first job i worked as a delivery  driver and dishwasher at a mom and pops  pizza shop
iOv2elBzPLg,3519839,3526400,the shop is within walking distance of  my apartment which i just got alone  the shop is owned by a foreign man and
iOv2elBzPLg,3526400,3532079,his two nephews and another friend of  theirs i was the only female in the  entire building
iOv2elBzPLg,3532079,3538480,at first the owner asked me to change  into my work shirt the first day  in the walk-in freezer
iOv2elBzPLg,3538480,3543599,i declined and put it on in the bathroom  he supervised me delivering pizzas and
iOv2elBzPLg,3543599,3549280,put his arm around my chair and told me  to join him and the workers after work  for drinks
iOv2elBzPLg,3549280,3555359,i politely declined i wasn't even old  enough to drink  he asked if i had a boyfriend which i
iOv2elBzPLg,3555359,3561440,did at the time and i told him yes he  just lived in another state  he then offered his worker to sleep on
iOv2elBzPLg,3561440,3569520,my couch because he didn't have a place  to stay  without consulting me  i obviously protested and declined
iOv2elBzPLg,3569520,3575040,he also told me that he knew my  boyfriend's name which he did which i  never told him
iOv2elBzPLg,3575040,3582240,as time went on things got weirder the  owner would take me out back where there  were no cameras and scold me for not
iOv2elBzPLg,3582240,3589520,pouring bleach into the dishes i was  washing  i told him that you can't stick your  hands in the bleach but he didn't care
iOv2elBzPLg,3589520,3596000,he would take me out back after my shift  and compliment my eyeglasses and tell me  how beautiful i was
iOv2elBzPLg,3596000,3602400,i would say thanks back away and drive  home every time  he came up behind me as i was washing
iOv2elBzPLg,3602400,3608400,dishes and glue on the back of my neck  and then proceeded to tell me that since  i live alone
iOv2elBzPLg,3608400,3614640,didn't inform him of this then i should  be careful  he then stated that he knew the exact
iOv2elBzPLg,3614640,3620799,layout of the apartment because his  friend lives there  i told him i had a male roommate i
iOv2elBzPLg,3620799,3627200,didn't and he chuckles and told me i did  not and that he was going to break into  my apartment
iOv2elBzPLg,3627200,3632400,i was stunned and had four deliveries  waiting for me to drop them off
iOv2elBzPLg,3632400,3639119,on the way out the door his nephew  muttered something about me being a girl  i threw the pizza bags into the car and
iOv2elBzPLg,3639119,3646240,promptly pulled over had a panic attack  and dropped all five pizzas and whatever  else i was delivering at the first house
iOv2elBzPLg,3646240,3652319,and didn't give a [ __ ]  i went home to my apartment called my  mom and sat in the kitchen with a hammer
iOv2elBzPLg,3652319,3658400,for safety  someone was knocking on my front door  but i didn't look to see who
iOv2elBzPLg,3658400,3663599,i already had a feeling  then the pizza shop called me repeatedly
iOv2elBzPLg,3663599,3670480,i left my eyeglasses in the shop and had  their pizza bags my dad went into the  store took the pizza bags back and
iOv2elBzPLg,3670480,3677119,threatened the owner saying he has no  problem going back to jail my dad  brought back my glasses
iOv2elBzPLg,3677119,3685200,months later i ran into the nephew at my  college campus and he proceeded to make  unending uncomfortable eye contact until
iOv2elBzPLg,3685200,3693040,we passed each other  after the incidents i got a huge 100  pound american bulldog that kept me safe
iOv2elBzPLg,3693040,3699440,until the day she died  the pizza shop is still open for  business and i'm still living in my
iOv2elBzPLg,3699440,3704880,apartment  needless to say  i don't order pizza from that shop
iOv2elBzPLg,3704880,3707519,anymore
iOv2elBzPLg,3710640,3717200,about 10 years ago when i was 12  i moved into a more safer and calmer
iOv2elBzPLg,3717200,3723760,neighborhood  about a week after i realized an ice  cream truck came every sunday i was
iOv2elBzPLg,3723760,3731520,excited  my mom didn't assist me since i was old  enough to do it on my own
iOv2elBzPLg,3731520,3737760,when i previously lived at my old house  my favorite ice cream flavor was cherry  chocolate chip hence i've been eating
iOv2elBzPLg,3737760,3746000,that flavor since i was three  i never really changed that flavor when  ordering but it was okay
iOv2elBzPLg,3746000,3752480,after about five months  i started to realize that my favorite  ice cream flavor was
iOv2elBzPLg,3752480,3759280,starting to taste as if there was  something weird in it  but i didn't mind it
iOv2elBzPLg,3759280,3765760,one day my mom asked to taste my ice  cream and i agreed and gave it to her
iOv2elBzPLg,3765760,3773280,she tasted it and had a concerned look  on her face  over time i obviously got bored of that
iOv2elBzPLg,3773280,3779599,flavor so i wanted to get other flavored  ice creams  around the time of all of this i started
iOv2elBzPLg,3779599,3785520,to feel sick and tired  i blamed it on my lack of sleep
iOv2elBzPLg,3785520,3791839,anyways i went to order chocolate ice  cream  the man selling the ice creams were  getting pissed at me
iOv2elBzPLg,3791839,3796880,telling me if i was sure that i don't  want any cherry ice cream
iOv2elBzPLg,3796880,3802000,i started to get suspicious  i talked to my mom about it and she said
iOv2elBzPLg,3802000,3808559,that she would look into it  since she was a nurse who had knowledge  and links
iOv2elBzPLg,3808559,3815359,so i bought the cherry chocolate flavor  again and gave it to my mum so that she  could test on it and she did
iOv2elBzPLg,3815359,3821839,when she came back  we found out that he was actually  drugging me
iOv2elBzPLg,3821839,3828960,causing me to feel sick so  we reported him  but he was not caught
iOv2elBzPLg,3828960,3834160,i can't help thinking what would have  happened if  i didn't give my mom
iOv2elBzPLg,3834160,3837960,the ice cream to taste
iOv2elBzPLg,3845119,3852400,my name is donovan and i'm a 14 year old  light skin boy at the time of the story  i was 11 or 12. i can't remember all i
iOv2elBzPLg,3852400,3858480,remember is that i was in the fifth  grade at the time anyways one day i got  home from school and called up my friend  ethan he's been my friend ever since
iOv2elBzPLg,3858480,3865200,third grade and we're still friends to  this day on the phone i asked if we  should play basketball at my school's  park so i got my basketball and a few
iOv2elBzPLg,3865200,3870400,cold water bottles and put them all in  my backpack i rode my bike over to the  school basketball court i sat there a
iOv2elBzPLg,3870400,3876160,few minutes because ethan's house wasn't  as close to the school as mine was he  got to the court around 4 pm we started
iOv2elBzPLg,3876160,3881200,to play basketball for a few hours  before ethan said we should go to the  sewer tunnels there were some large
iOv2elBzPLg,3881200,3886880,sewer tunnels about six or seven feet  tall and they were only about 15 minutes  away on bike i was bored of playing
iOv2elBzPLg,3886880,3892960,basketball for a few hours so i said  sure and we rode our bikes 15 minutes  away to the tunnels they were in a ditch
iOv2elBzPLg,3892960,3898000,and under a pretty busy road to describe  them a little when me and ethan got  there we hopped off our bikes and
iOv2elBzPLg,3898000,3904079,started walking through the tunnels  pushing our bikes with us we walked for  maybe about 30 seconds before he  recommended we should turn our bikes
iOv2elBzPLg,3904079,3909280,around while pushing them in case we see  anything we can just hop on our bikes  and pedal away instead of having to turn
iOv2elBzPLg,3909280,3914960,them around and then get on to pedal  away i said that's a good idea and could  possibly save our lives so we did it we
iOv2elBzPLg,3914960,3920240,walked in the tunnel for a few more  minutes with our phone flashlights on  looking for cool old stuff out of
iOv2elBzPLg,3920240,3925440,nowhere he stopped me and said be quiet  do you hear that i was listening for a
iOv2elBzPLg,3925440,3932160,few seconds and then i heard it i heard  loud breathing  and a giggling going through the tunnel
iOv2elBzPLg,3932160,3938319,he whispered with a worried look that we  should get out of here i was scared as  hell i obviously agreed we got on our
iOv2elBzPLg,3938319,3945760,bikes and started pedaling as fast as we  could to get out of there as we were  riding through the tunnel the breathing  and giggling turned into this very loud
iOv2elBzPLg,3945760,3951039,psychopathic screaming and laughter we  also heard someone chasing us after a  few seconds there were some loud
iOv2elBzPLg,3951039,3956319,footsteps following us we pedaled for  our lies for one more minute to the end  of the tunnel when we got to the end of
iOv2elBzPLg,3956319,3961839,the tunnel it was completely dark  outside but at the tunnel entrance there  was a light right above it i looked back
iOv2elBzPLg,3961839,3969039,after 30 seconds of pedaling what i saw  almost made me fall off my bike and pass  out there were six men all dressed in
iOv2elBzPLg,3969039,3974319,suits  and they were all wearing terrifying  white masks each one of them had a
iOv2elBzPLg,3974319,3981280,machete with blood all over it i also  noticed that their masks and suits had  blood smeared all over them i saw all
iOv2elBzPLg,3981280,3987200,that and screamed and they started  chasing us we were still paddling away  desperately trying to get to my house we
iOv2elBzPLg,3987200,3993119,got to my house after 10 minutes we hit  our bikes in my garage because if they  saw the house with the same bikes we
iOv2elBzPLg,3993119,3999039,rode away in they would know it was us  earl and i burst into the house where my  parents were watching tv we told our
iOv2elBzPLg,3999039,4005200,parents what we saw and they called the  police ethan and i told the cops where  we saw the men and they drove over there
iOv2elBzPLg,4005200,4010640,when the policemen entered the tunnel  two of the men charged at them with  machetes and the police ended up having
iOv2elBzPLg,4010640,4016559,to kill those two men i don't feel bad  the other four men were found in a room  in one of the tunnels in the room they
iOv2elBzPLg,4016559,4021680,found the four men but in that room  there were around 20 dead bodies and
iOv2elBzPLg,4021680,4026960,four kids still alive with tape around  their mouths the police arrested the men
iOv2elBzPLg,4026960,4033359,and freed the kids and thankfully the  kids were all right the four men got  sentenced to death and were thankfully
iOv2elBzPLg,4033359,4038480,executed about a year ago this is a  haunting memory and i am very thankful
iOv2elBzPLg,4038480,4044400,that ethan said we should turn our bikes  around because if we didn't and we were  too slow we could have ended up like
iOv2elBzPLg,4044400,4049558,those 20 unlucky people before us
iOv2elBzPLg,4055610,4060720,[Music]
iOv2elBzPLg,4060720,4066079,this story happened two years ago  i am known at my school because of my
iOv2elBzPLg,4066079,4071520,dancing skills  i love dancing  especially hip hop
iOv2elBzPLg,4071520,4076960,we have a school event that happens once  every school year a competition that
iOv2elBzPLg,4076960,4084160,every school joins  it has sports academics  and dance competition
iOv2elBzPLg,4084160,4089440,my dance teacher recruited me and 14  other students for the modern dance
iOv2elBzPLg,4089440,4096159,competition  we practiced for three months and the  competition was only four days away
iOv2elBzPLg,4096159,4102000,so our dance teacher told us that the  next day we will practice until 9 pm
iOv2elBzPLg,4102000,4109199,and sleep in the 5th grade classroom  i was excited because it was my first  time sleeping over at our school with my
iOv2elBzPLg,4109199,4114640,friends  our dance teacher asked our parents if  it's ok if we sleep over at the school
iOv2elBzPLg,4114640,4120400,and they all agreed  the next day was  6 p.m
iOv2elBzPLg,4120400,4126238,we started practicing and it was very  tiring  30 minutes later the coach told us to
iOv2elBzPLg,4126238,4131278,take a 5-minute break  i was talking my friend kate while
iOv2elBzPLg,4131278,4137679,having a break  we were talking about boys  she was full of joy and kept bragging
iOv2elBzPLg,4137679,4144880,about her crush and then suddenly she  just fainted  at first i thought she was just playing
iOv2elBzPLg,4144880,4152719,i told her that the coach was waiting  for us since i heard him call our names  as i got up she didn't move
iOv2elBzPLg,4152719,4159040,and i noticed that her lips were pale  i panicked and told her to wake up
iOv2elBzPLg,4159040,4166159,our friends saw what happened and kate  ended up going back home because she  felt tired and sick
iOv2elBzPLg,4166159,4173359,i was a bit sad because she was my  closest friend in the group  anyways it was 9 pm
iOv2elBzPLg,4173359,4179120,and we immediately prepared our beds  we were fast asleep until i walked by
iOv2elBzPLg,4179120,4186318,the sound of a bowl bouncing  it was coming from the gym  the gym was near to the classroom we
iOv2elBzPLg,4186318,4191359,slept in i checked my phone and the time  was 1am
iOv2elBzPLg,4191359,4198400,i wanted to check who it was in the gym  so i tried to wake up one of my friends  but she didn't because all of us were
iOv2elBzPLg,4198400,4205679,really tired  so i went to the gym by myself  when i entered the gym i saw a boy
iOv2elBzPLg,4205679,4211679,playing basketball  i can only see his back  i was still able to see even though it
iOv2elBzPLg,4211679,4217440,was a little dark  he was tall  his skin was pale
iOv2elBzPLg,4217440,4223120,his hair was long  [Music]  i can tell that he looked very cool and
iOv2elBzPLg,4223120,4229360,charming even though i couldn't properly  see him  then he noticed me
iOv2elBzPLg,4229360,4236239,that i woke you up  he asked coldly  after he said that i could see his face
iOv2elBzPLg,4236239,4244159,so i answered him who are you  i haven't seen you before  he stopped playing and faced me i'm the
iOv2elBzPLg,4244159,4251120,captain of our basketball team  you don't know me  i was confused
iOv2elBzPLg,4251120,4258880,i know almost everyone in the school  especially the basketball players since  i am very interested in basketball
iOv2elBzPLg,4258880,4264800,you're joking  after i said that he just rolled his  eyes and continued playing i was about
iOv2elBzPLg,4264800,4270080,to leave the gym  but i turned my head to see his face  again but then
iOv2elBzPLg,4270080,4275520,he was not there anymore  all i saw was the ball bouncing
iOv2elBzPLg,4275520,4282239,until it lost its bounce  where did he go  i just shrugged it off and went back to
iOv2elBzPLg,4282239,4288800,the others and slept  in the morning  we were eating breakfast at the canteen
iOv2elBzPLg,4288800,4294560,and i told everyone what happened last  night  some of them believed and some
iOv2elBzPLg,4294560,4300560,just laughed  and i noticed that one of the school  staff overheard my story
iOv2elBzPLg,4300560,4307120,after eating breakfast we were about to  leave the school canteen but the school  staff stopped me
iOv2elBzPLg,4307120,4313360,he asked did you see george last night  and i said um yeah
iOv2elBzPLg,4313360,4319520,was his name george did you know him  then the staff was quiet for like 10
iOv2elBzPLg,4319520,4325280,seconds and said  the boy you saw died years ago
iOv2elBzPLg,4325280,4330320,i was completely shocked  the staff told me the story he said that
iOv2elBzPLg,4330320,4338199,george was a basketball player and he  studied here in the school  in  1995
iOv2elBzPLg,4338719,4344480,many loved him and admired his looks it  was once a basketball tournament and a
iOv2elBzPLg,4344480,4350960,team lost because of him  after the tournament  everyone in the school were making fun
iOv2elBzPLg,4350960,4357040,of him  he also got kicked out of the team  he and his girlfriend broke up right
iOv2elBzPLg,4357040,4362140,after his will  after that he  committed suicide
iOv2elBzPLg,4362140,4370880,[Music]  he hung himself to the basketball ring  the staff can also see george sometimes
iOv2elBzPLg,4370880,4377679,he can see him go to school as if he was  a normal student  after hearing that story
iOv2elBzPLg,4377679,4382840,i realized when i was talking to him  last night he was wearing an  old-fashioned
iOv2elBzPLg,4382840,4390560,jersey i was so scared  how on earth could i see someone who  died years ago
iOv2elBzPLg,4390560,4395560,since then  i always pray
iOv2elBzPLg,4400159,4405920,two years ago i had my first sleep  paralysis experience i'm the kind of
iOv2elBzPLg,4405920,4412080,girl who enjoys horror and spooky things  although i knew it's all in my mind the
iOv2elBzPLg,4412080,4417360,fear at that moment was so intense and  so real
iOv2elBzPLg,4417360,4423600,i  kind of enjoyed it  from there  i continued to have small sleep
iOv2elBzPLg,4423600,4430000,paralysis experiences that were actually  kind of boring and less frequent it all
iOv2elBzPLg,4430000,4436400,just kind of became normal to me but  last year  around the month of november
iOv2elBzPLg,4436400,4444000,my dad and my brother had some kind of  argument going on in which my brother  was speaking very poorly about my dad
iOv2elBzPLg,4444000,4449679,and it actually hurt my dad's feelings  quite a bit  he actually stopped going to church we
iOv2elBzPLg,4449679,4456320,had a small temple outside of our house  where most of the time my parents would  go to worship it felt quite strange to
iOv2elBzPLg,4456320,4462719,me because  i haven't even seen him pray since but  regardless i figured it was just a
iOv2elBzPLg,4462719,4468400,personal situation and i shrugged it off  even so  i don't know why
iOv2elBzPLg,4468400,4474480,but i felt as if my surroundings were  starting to become negative  and something and i couldn't put my
iOv2elBzPLg,4474480,4480480,finger on it but something was getting  me scared i started having nightmares
iOv2elBzPLg,4480480,4487679,like i was being chased by some evil  headless skinny entities  burning everything they touched like
iOv2elBzPLg,4487679,4494000,hellfire  torturing people not only this but i  also witnessed some strange sounds
iOv2elBzPLg,4494000,4500719,coming from my cupboard like scratching  and quiet bangs  i shared these experiences with my twin
iOv2elBzPLg,4500719,4506719,sister  and she really didn't believe me at  first  but she did tell me that she was also
iOv2elBzPLg,4506719,4513360,feeling a negative energy in the house  something she couldn't explain  it wasn't long before school reopened
iOv2elBzPLg,4513360,4519440,from summer vacation and we were too  consumed with schoolwork to think about  what was going on in our home
iOv2elBzPLg,4519440,4526880,and interestingly  once we became distracted we stopped  noticing the activity in our house but
iOv2elBzPLg,4526880,4532000,last night was different it was  terrifying and something that i can't  ignore
iOv2elBzPLg,4532000,4537199,i was completing my practical files and  started getting tired it was almost 2 30
iOv2elBzPLg,4537199,4544480,in the morning so i decided it was time  to go to bed while i was laying down i  was just watching my ceiling but it
iOv2elBzPLg,4544480,4550400,looked darker than usual  i opened my curtains to allow some of  the street lights to enter my room but
iOv2elBzPLg,4550400,4555760,nothing seemed to be working as tired as  i was i decided just to ignore this and
iOv2elBzPLg,4555760,4563040,fell asleep cuddling my blanket over top  of me you know what i mean laying on my  back on the bed facing up my hands over
iOv2elBzPLg,4563040,4568880,the blanket like i'm hugging it and my  hands were kind of touching my opposite  shoulders with the blanket between my
iOv2elBzPLg,4568880,4574239,body and my arms but as i drifted off it  kind of felt like my body was floating
iOv2elBzPLg,4574239,4579440,in the air like i was hanging from my  ceiling it wasn't a bad feeling i kind
iOv2elBzPLg,4579440,4586400,of liked it but then i realized that my  body was getting stiff  like i was being paralyzed and it felt
iOv2elBzPLg,4586400,4591760,like  an energy above me  was taking something from me
iOv2elBzPLg,4591760,4598159,like attracting me upwards my torso  mainly in my chest started expanding
iOv2elBzPLg,4598159,4604960,towards the ceiling and it was becoming  hard to breathe i started losing control  of my body and i was feeling like my
iOv2elBzPLg,4604960,4611600,body had no life left in it my soul was  leaving i started to suffocate my body
iOv2elBzPLg,4611600,4618400,was pulsing really badly and i could  literally feel every single pulse in my
iOv2elBzPLg,4618400,4624640,teeth my neck my head my arms my legs i  can feel  but i can't
iOv2elBzPLg,4624640,4630719,move  i started to get pains in my chest  i got so scared that i started trying to
iOv2elBzPLg,4630719,4636480,wake my body up and luckily i started to  get some control back i was able to open
iOv2elBzPLg,4636480,4643360,my mouth and when i did i literally  gasped for air like somebody that was  drowning in water and as soon as i got
iOv2elBzPLg,4643360,4648719,my breathing under control i opened my  eyes wide and scanned the entire room
iOv2elBzPLg,4648719,4654880,and i could not believe what i saw  there was a dark disfigured shadow
iOv2elBzPLg,4654880,4662400,watching me with its bright white eyes  and when i looked at it closely  it just walked out my bedroom door
iOv2elBzPLg,4662400,4667520,i was so scared i couldn't sleep  yesterday and i ended up playing some
iOv2elBzPLg,4667520,4673760,prayers on my phone and  i never do that  i couldn't believe what i saw
iOv2elBzPLg,4673760,4680400,i told my dad about the incident and  about all of the things that i was  experiencing from before and he said
iOv2elBzPLg,4680400,4686880,with a very serious and worried look on  his face  you don't have to worry about it anymore
iOv2elBzPLg,4686880,4692400,i will always protect you  and then he said one more thing  quote
iOv2elBzPLg,4692400,4700600,i forgive him  and i think  he was talking about my brother
iOv2elBzPLg,4703940,4709440,[Music]  so the story i'm going to tell you is
iOv2elBzPLg,4709440,4716080,fairly recent it happened back in 2020  just before coven 19 was a global thread
iOv2elBzPLg,4716080,4722960,me  i go by alex and my friend who we'll  call mega both 18 year old males moved
iOv2elBzPLg,4722960,4728880,to a new city in order to attend college  here in brazil i lived in a white  apartment building with three female
iOv2elBzPLg,4728880,4735280,friends of mine while he lived in a  green apartment building with two  friends one male and the other female
iOv2elBzPLg,4735280,4740640,those buildings both faced each other  just separated by a narrow dark street
iOv2elBzPLg,4740640,4749199,although we both lived with friends we  mostly hung out with just the two of us  now i'll admit the town we moved to was
iOv2elBzPLg,4749199,4754320,not so safe  every day it seemed like there was  another case involving armed robbery
iOv2elBzPLg,4754320,4761679,even though it was just a rural town but  keep in mind that most rural towns in  brazil can have up to a hundred thousand
iOv2elBzPLg,4761679,4766719,residents so on a global scale this town  was actually pretty big
iOv2elBzPLg,4766719,4771840,that night we went to a restaurant  called habib's a very common brazilian
iOv2elBzPLg,4771840,4777679,fast food company that specializes in  middle eastern cuisine the food there  wasn't bad
iOv2elBzPLg,4777679,4784880,but the cooks were really  really slow  extra slow this time when we finally
iOv2elBzPLg,4784880,4791920,finished our meal it was just past  midnight we discussed what to do next  and i suggested we should go back home
iOv2elBzPLg,4791920,4798800,get our graffiti cans and mess around  the city a little bit we managed this in  less than a minute as habib's was less
iOv2elBzPLg,4798800,4804080,than a block away from our apartments  then we went to a gas station  convenience store that was right next to
iOv2elBzPLg,4804080,4810080,the restaurant we bought a good amount  of alcohol so we could drink while we  were walking since we hadn't had the
iOv2elBzPLg,4810080,4815360,chance to really get to know the city  until that night  we just went straight to a random avenue
iOv2elBzPLg,4815360,4821360,and started walking without proper  direction we saw every type of strange  person there
iOv2elBzPLg,4821360,4828960,it wasn't a car busy avenue the lighting  was dim and it was full of homeless  people drunks thugs and hookers no one
iOv2elBzPLg,4828960,4834800,cared to mess with us though i was  always the type of guy that dressed in a  punk style and even had a green dyed
iOv2elBzPLg,4834800,4840880,mohawk back then  mega was more of a casual goth guy we  didn't like to be feared just by the way
iOv2elBzPLg,4840880,4846320,we looked but it was absolutely nice to  feel a little safer we turned down the
iOv2elBzPLg,4846320,4851520,darkest street and descended it until we  found a nice alleyway with no security
iOv2elBzPLg,4851520,4858000,cameras we started to spray paint the  walls this is something we used to do a  lot back in our hometown
iOv2elBzPLg,4858000,4863360,i can't explain it but we just felt safe  in there it might have had something to
iOv2elBzPLg,4863360,4869280,do with the fact that we were really  drunk  it was then  it started raining
iOv2elBzPLg,4869280,4876080,not just regular rain now  we'd found ourselves in a summer  thunderstorm in our country you really
iOv2elBzPLg,4876080,4882239,need to be scared of lightning since we  have more lightning incidences here than  anywhere else in the world we ran from
iOv2elBzPLg,4882239,4888400,the alleyway to the street and looked  around  that's when i saw a barely lit  establishment with an awning in the
iOv2elBzPLg,4888400,4895440,front door  as we got there  i noticed it was a laundromat  a really messed up one the awning didn't
iOv2elBzPLg,4895440,4901679,protect us though the wind was so  furious that we were getting even more  soaked and cold that's when i heard a
iOv2elBzPLg,4901679,4906800,loud noise it wasn't coming from the  empty street  instead
iOv2elBzPLg,4906800,4911920,it was coming from the building itself  i looked inside the laundromat it was
iOv2elBzPLg,4911920,4917679,illuminated by a faint yellow lamp one  of those really cheap ones you know no
iOv2elBzPLg,4917679,4924239,doubt why all of the other lights were  already dead when i searched for the  origin of the noise i spotted a working
iOv2elBzPLg,4924239,4930000,washing machine  i told mega about it and we thought it  was actually a 24-hour laundromat i
iOv2elBzPLg,4930000,4935040,tried opening the door and found it to  be unlocked we went inside and closed  the door
iOv2elBzPLg,4935040,4940080,to my surprise it even had a recessed  key  probably to protect the users from
iOv2elBzPLg,4940080,4946000,getting robbed i remembered all those  strange people from the avenue and fear  finally kicked in
iOv2elBzPLg,4946000,4952880,i locked the door  inside the building i started to feel  uneasy  mega was even more scared than i was
iOv2elBzPLg,4952880,4958719,actually never been to a laundromat  before they weren't common back in my  hometown but i guess they're popular in
iOv2elBzPLg,4958719,4964560,the bigger cities this specific  laundromat though  was far from pleasant
iOv2elBzPLg,4964560,4970639,it reeked like damp dirty clothing the  only dim light in the place flickered
iOv2elBzPLg,4970639,4977360,from time to time but the thing that  upset me the most  was the washing machine it was so much
iOv2elBzPLg,4977360,4984320,noisier from inside i mean come on i  could hear it outside on top of the  thunderstorm it sounded like somebody
iOv2elBzPLg,4984320,4992080,was washing stones megathen started  looking at me and he whispered if this  is a 24-hour laundromat and there's a
iOv2elBzPLg,4992080,4997199,washing machine running then where is  the person that's using it
iOv2elBzPLg,4997199,5003679,i froze there was definitely something  wrong here i thought maybe the person  could have gone for a walk or was using
iOv2elBzPLg,5003679,5010159,the bathrooms but when i searched around  looking for a door that could lead to a  possible bathroom what i saw was
iOv2elBzPLg,5010159,5016080,something way creepier than you can even  imagine  two guys were watching us from the  darkness
iOv2elBzPLg,5016080,5022159,one of them had wide eyes and a grim  smile on his face  the other had his head down and was
iOv2elBzPLg,5022159,5029199,giggling the one with open eyes was the  first to make a move he was coming right  towards me when all of a sudden he stops
iOv2elBzPLg,5029199,5035840,and says i wasn't expecting any visitors  today boss will not be pleased if we let  them escape alive
iOv2elBzPLg,5035840,5041679,he said while trying to reach for me  with some quick thinking mega sprayed  some spray paint right into his eyes the
iOv2elBzPLg,5041679,5047280,guy immediately backed off and started  desperately trying to remove the pain  from his eyes that's when the other guy
iOv2elBzPLg,5047280,5052800,grabbed mega's arm  all i could do was watch at that moment  too scared to do anything then i
iOv2elBzPLg,5052800,5059920,remembered about the stiletto i carry  with me everywhere i grabbed it pulled  the blade out and stabbed him two times
iOv2elBzPLg,5059920,5064960,in his side he started to agonize in  pain  and as soon as mega got released he
iOv2elBzPLg,5064960,5070320,unlocked the door and we ran away not  ever looking back  the storm had turned into a calm rain
iOv2elBzPLg,5070320,5076239,when we reached our street i invited  megan to my apartment and he agreed we  thought it'd be better if we stayed
iOv2elBzPLg,5076239,5082000,awake together and my roommates were  probably sleeping by that time since  they had classes in the morning when we
iOv2elBzPLg,5082000,5088639,entered my home however the three girls  were still awake and they looked really  concerned i asked them what was wrong
iOv2elBzPLg,5088639,5095040,and they told us  we wanted to stay up late tonight so we  went for a short walk we came back and
iOv2elBzPLg,5095040,5101040,were in front of the garage talking  together it started to rain so we  entered the building shut the door
iOv2elBzPLg,5101040,5108000,and we're climbing the stairs when one  of us took a peek at the street through  the small window  at that moment we saw a pickup truck in
iOv2elBzPLg,5108000,5113360,the middle of the street a guy was  dragging a lifeless corpse to the back  of the vehicle
iOv2elBzPLg,5113360,5119840,and another guy that wasn't the driver  got out of the car to help him when the  corpse was loaded
iOv2elBzPLg,5119840,5126880,they got in the truck and drove away  we followed up with our own laundromat  story they were shocked all those creepy
iOv2elBzPLg,5126880,5132719,guys they were probably together  we called 1-9-0 the emergency number
iOv2elBzPLg,5132719,5138000,here you might know it as 9-1-1 we told  them about the laundromat and gave them  our address
iOv2elBzPLg,5138000,5143760,the cops soon arrived at our apartment  we told them everything that had  happened a female officer told us that
iOv2elBzPLg,5143760,5150719,there wasn't such a thing as a 24-hour  laundromat in the city even worse the  place that we were in had been condemned
iOv2elBzPLg,5150719,5156400,due to a fire  we were shocked she then received a  message from the radio letting us know
iOv2elBzPLg,5156400,5161679,that they had arrested the guys turns  out they were a dangerous gang of  addicts that used burglary and
iOv2elBzPLg,5161679,5167840,assassination to buy illegal drugs the  dead body that my friends saw  was actually that of one of our
iOv2elBzPLg,5167840,5172880,neighbors i was never called to testify  about the stabbing i did i assumed i'd
iOv2elBzPLg,5172880,5178719,be called in order to prove that i was  just defending myself i'm thinking the  cops covered this up for me since we
iOv2elBzPLg,5178719,5184719,helped them catch the guys i have no  idea what would have happened to megan i  if the other guys had showed up i don't
iOv2elBzPLg,5184719,5190960,know what would have happened if the  girls stayed outside and i don't even  want to think about what was inside that
iOv2elBzPLg,5190960,5196960,washing machine but we've learned our  lesson  never  let your guard down in a place you don't
iOv2elBzPLg,5196960,5199960,know
