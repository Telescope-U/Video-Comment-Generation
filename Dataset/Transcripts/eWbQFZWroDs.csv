eWbQFZWroDs,13200,15519,you yeah forget it guess i'll become a
eWbQFZWroDs,15519,16120,youtuber
eWbQFZWroDs,16120,27820,[Music]
eWbQFZWroDs,29279,32398,hello internet welcome to food theory
eWbQFZWroDs,32398,34480,the show that's like the ivy league of
eWbQFZWroDs,34480,36399,youtube channels all right so maybe not
eWbQFZWroDs,36399,38079,ivy league but we're a solid safety
eWbQFZWroDs,38079,40000,school and best of all we have a 100
eWbQFZWroDs,40000,41760,acceptance rate the only step in the
eWbQFZWroDs,41760,43200,application process hitting the
eWbQFZWroDs,43200,45680,subscribe button right now 56 percent of
eWbQFZWroDs,45680,47360,you aren't subscribed so we'd like to
eWbQFZWroDs,47360,49520,boost those application numbers to join
eWbQFZWroDs,49520,51280,honor roll all you need to do is turn on
eWbQFZWroDs,51280,53039,notifications and boy will you be
eWbQFZWroDs,53039,54559,thankful that you enrolled into the
eWbQFZWroDs,54559,56559,channel today because i'm gonna make you
eWbQFZWroDs,56559,59520,rich and it all boils down to fast food
eWbQFZWroDs,59520,61600,chicken see back in november of 2020 i
eWbQFZWroDs,61600,63280,did a video all about mcdonald's
eWbQFZWroDs,63280,65119,exposing the fact that it's not a fast
eWbQFZWroDs,65119,67280,food company but instead takes most of
eWbQFZWroDs,67280,70000,its money in via real estate which seems
eWbQFZWroDs,70000,71520,odd when you consider what those golden
eWbQFZWroDs,71520,73520,arches are best known for the basic gist
eWbQFZWroDs,73520,74799,of it all is that when someone applies
eWbQFZWroDs,74799,76960,to open a mcrestaurant mcdonald's gets
eWbQFZWroDs,76960,78799,to choose the location they will then
eWbQFZWroDs,78799,80640,ensure that they own the land and
eWbQFZWroDs,80640,82080,building that the restaurant is going
eWbQFZWroDs,82080,84080,into why would they care about that well
eWbQFZWroDs,84080,85520,it means that for every new restaurant
eWbQFZWroDs,85520,87040,that gets opened mcdonald's gets to
eWbQFZWroDs,87040,90320,collect a franchise fee of around 45 000
eWbQFZWroDs,90320,92640,as well as a cut of all food sales made
eWbQFZWroDs,92640,94159,which are the sorts of things that you'd
eWbQFZWroDs,94159,95759,expect out of a deal like this but it
eWbQFZWroDs,95759,97920,also means that they collect rent from
eWbQFZWroDs,97920,100479,their franchisees and that is where the
eWbQFZWroDs,100479,102399,real money starts to roll in it's an
eWbQFZWroDs,102399,103920,arrangement that ultimately works out
eWbQFZWroDs,103920,105840,pretty well for both parties mcdonald's
eWbQFZWroDs,105840,107680,earns rent and a cut of food sales and
eWbQFZWroDs,107680,109840,the franchisee walks away with a yearly
eWbQFZWroDs,109840,111759,salary around five percent of what they
eWbQFZWroDs,111759,113600,sell per year this results in about a
eWbQFZWroDs,113600,115360,hundred and fifty thousand dollars
eWbQFZWroDs,115360,117360,provided they sell three million in
eWbQFZWroDs,117360,119360,gross sales that's the rough average per
eWbQFZWroDs,119360,121360,year of mickey d sales here in the us
eWbQFZWroDs,121360,123759,not too shabby right this idea of a fast
eWbQFZWroDs,123759,125520,food brand essentially leasing out their
eWbQFZWroDs,125520,127520,restaurants known as the sonoborn model
eWbQFZWroDs,127520,130080,has been wildly successful so successful
eWbQFZWroDs,130080,131599,in fact that most fast food chains in
eWbQFZWroDs,131599,134000,the us use it but some are apparently
eWbQFZWroDs,134000,135599,more difficult to get access to than
eWbQFZWroDs,135599,137680,others case in point chick-fil-a
eWbQFZWroDs,137680,139200,according to online reports getting to
eWbQFZWroDs,139200,140560,be the owner of one of these restaurants
eWbQFZWroDs,140560,143200,is simultaneously easier and harder than
eWbQFZWroDs,143200,144480,every single one of these other ones
eWbQFZWroDs,144480,146800,combined in fact as the story goes you
eWbQFZWroDs,146800,148400,have a better chance of getting accepted
eWbQFZWroDs,148400,150560,into a prestigious college like harvard
eWbQFZWroDs,150560,152720,than you do of owning a chick-fil-a but
eWbQFZWroDs,152720,155040,that's just the story right it can't be
eWbQFZWroDs,155040,156720,true so you know what i wanted to look
eWbQFZWroDs,156720,158400,into the statistics is becoming a
eWbQFZWroDs,158400,161040,restaurant franchisee a better path than
eWbQFZWroDs,161040,163599,going to college is slinging sandwiches
eWbQFZWroDs,163599,165920,gonna make you rich well i watched hours
eWbQFZWroDs,165920,168160,of interviews and read the 403 page
eWbQFZWroDs,168160,170080,franchise disclosure document to find
eWbQFZWroDs,170080,172640,out exactly that and uh well consider
eWbQFZWroDs,172640,175440,today your chicken sciences 101 credit
eWbQFZWroDs,175440,177440,what makes chick-fil-a so different from
eWbQFZWroDs,177440,179440,everyone else can passing out poultry
eWbQFZWroDs,179440,181599,pack your pockets those my friends are
eWbQFZWroDs,181599,183360,questions that are absolutely gonna be
eWbQFZWroDs,183360,186000,on the final exam and no you cannot take
eWbQFZWroDs,186000,188239,this class as pass fail thank you first
eWbQFZWroDs,188239,189360,let's take a look at what it means to be
eWbQFZWroDs,189360,191200,a fast food franchisee as i mentioned
eWbQFZWroDs,191200,192560,before the first step is paying the
eWbQFZWroDs,192560,194480,franchise fee a one-time cost that
eWbQFZWroDs,194480,196319,varies wildly from chain to chain
eWbQFZWroDs,196319,198239,mcdonald's is on the higher end of this
eWbQFZWroDs,198239,200879,requiring you to pay 45 000 but places
eWbQFZWroDs,200879,202959,like subway are much lower clocking in
eWbQFZWroDs,202959,205360,at 15k chick-fil-a meanwhile is the
eWbQFZWroDs,205360,208319,lowest of anyone with a rock-bottom fee
eWbQFZWroDs,208319,210080,of only 10 000
eWbQFZWroDs,210080,212159,and even that is an overstatement
eWbQFZWroDs,212159,213760,because half of it basically functions
eWbQFZWroDs,213760,215840,as a security deposit if you treat your
eWbQFZWroDs,215840,218080,restaurant nice you get that 5k refunded
eWbQFZWroDs,218080,219440,to you when you're done with the company
eWbQFZWroDs,219440,221920,so off the bat things are looking pretty
eWbQFZWroDs,221920,224000,nice for chick-fil-a but the real
eWbQFZWroDs,224000,225760,challenge to becoming a franchise owner
eWbQFZWroDs,225760,227680,is to even start the process these
eWbQFZWroDs,227680,229040,companies will look into your personal
eWbQFZWroDs,229040,230560,net worth to see whether you can be
eWbQFZWroDs,230560,232080,trusted with their brand they aren't
eWbQFZWroDs,232080,233760,just gonna let anyone own those golden
eWbQFZWroDs,233760,235920,arches they have a reputation to uphold
eWbQFZWroDs,235920,237439,they need to ensure that you can be
eWbQFZWroDs,237439,239280,trusted to keep that ice cream machine
eWbQFZWroDs,239280,242080,broken at all costs subway once again is
eWbQFZWroDs,242080,243760,on the cheaper end of the spectrum only
eWbQFZWroDs,243760,245680,requiring a net worth of eighty thousand
eWbQFZWroDs,245680,248239,dollars mcdonald's requires a net worth
eWbQFZWroDs,248239,250879,of five hundred thousand wendy's is
eWbQFZWroDs,250879,253920,actually crazy high requiring a 5
eWbQFZWroDs,253920,256320,million net worth with 2 million of that
eWbQFZWroDs,256320,258239,being in what they call liquid assets
eWbQFZWroDs,258239,259759,basically assets that can be converted
eWbQFZWroDs,259759,261519,to cash in a short amount of time that
eWbQFZWroDs,261519,263919,is a huge barrier to entry if getting to
eWbQFZWroDs,263919,265600,own a chick-fil-a is harder than getting
eWbQFZWroDs,265600,267120,into harvard then the net worth
eWbQFZWroDs,267120,269120,requirement has to be crazy for this
eWbQFZWroDs,269120,271280,thing right well to start off operating
eWbQFZWroDs,271280,272880,a chick-fil-a you have to have a net
eWbQFZWroDs,272880,274639,worth of literally doesn't matter
eWbQFZWroDs,274639,276639,there's no requirement so the fees the
eWbQFZWroDs,276639,278240,lowest and there's no net worth
eWbQFZWroDs,278240,280400,requirement so what makes it so hard to
eWbQFZWroDs,280400,282400,get a chick-fil-a i mean chick-fil-a is
eWbQFZWroDs,282400,284160,also the highest grossing of any of
eWbQFZWroDs,284160,286240,these franchises qsr in the food
eWbQFZWroDs,286240,287919,industry stand for quick service
eWbQFZWroDs,287919,290240,restaurant and the magazine qsr which
eWbQFZWroDs,290240,292080,reports on the industry tends to track
eWbQFZWroDs,292080,294400,the performance of the 50 largest qsr
eWbQFZWroDs,294400,296240,chains according to their data an
eWbQFZWroDs,296240,298400,average chick-fil-a restaurant crushes
eWbQFZWroDs,298400,301360,it in sales raking in a staggering 5
eWbQFZWroDs,301360,304240,million dollars per year no one even
eWbQFZWroDs,304240,306880,comes close to that number mcdonald's
eWbQFZWroDs,306880,309680,comes in at 3 million starbucks at 1.2
eWbQFZWroDs,309680,312080,taco bell at 1.6 and higher sales
eWbQFZWroDs,312080,313919,usually mean higher earnings for the
eWbQFZWroDs,313919,316080,owner of the franchise so what's the big
eWbQFZWroDs,316080,318160,catch with chick-fil-a there has got to
eWbQFZWroDs,318160,320080,be some sort of trick here right well
eWbQFZWroDs,320080,322000,the problem isn't actually money it's
eWbQFZWroDs,322000,323600,interviews you can't just walk in with
eWbQFZWroDs,323600,324880,ten thousand dollars and be given a
eWbQFZWroDs,324880,327039,restaurant instead you have to apply and
eWbQFZWroDs,327039,329199,this process can take anywhere from 12
eWbQFZWroDs,329199,331840,to 24 months and that's not even just
eWbQFZWroDs,331840,333680,one person out of bad experience numbers
eWbQFZWroDs,333680,335280,that is what chick-fil-a themselves
eWbQFZWroDs,335280,337600,openly admit in their application video
eWbQFZWroDs,337600,339680,though it can go shorter as this
eWbQFZWroDs,339680,341280,operator admits in utah i've gone
eWbQFZWroDs,341280,342880,through about five rounds of interviews
eWbQFZWroDs,342880,344479,so that was about a about an eight month
eWbQFZWroDs,344479,346160,process how can a process deciding if
eWbQFZWroDs,346160,347680,you're good enough to run a restaurant
eWbQFZWroDs,347680,349680,take that long well when you expect your
eWbQFZWroDs,349680,352000,applicants to write 12 essays in order
eWbQFZWroDs,352000,354240,to qualify suddenly the timing starts to
eWbQFZWroDs,354240,356160,make a little sense you also have to
eWbQFZWroDs,356160,358479,submit your high school transcripts in
eWbQFZWroDs,358479,360080,short the comparison to getting into
eWbQFZWroDs,360080,361680,college is much more applicable than you
eWbQFZWroDs,361680,364400,might initially think but is it truly as
eWbQFZWroDs,364400,367120,hard as harvard well i ran the numbers
eWbQFZWroDs,367120,369039,harvard university in massachusetts is
eWbQFZWroDs,369039,370639,currently rated as the second best
eWbQFZWroDs,370639,372400,college in the us the application
eWbQFZWroDs,372400,374319,process only takes a few months much
eWbQFZWroDs,374319,375840,shorter compared to chick-fil-a it
eWbQFZWroDs,375840,377919,requires you to write four essays as
eWbQFZWroDs,377919,380080,opposed to 12. and you have to attend
eWbQFZWroDs,380080,382319,one or two interviews compared to five
eWbQFZWroDs,382319,384000,or more but of course just because
eWbQFZWroDs,384000,385280,you're doing less work it doesn't make
eWbQFZWroDs,385280,387840,harvard any easier to get into and you'd
eWbQFZWroDs,387840,390800,be right about that in 2021 just over 40
eWbQFZWroDs,390800,392960,000 students applied to harvard and of
eWbQFZWroDs,392960,394280,those only
eWbQFZWroDs,394280,396880,2056 were accepted which gives them an
eWbQFZWroDs,396880,399520,acceptance rate of 5.14
eWbQFZWroDs,399520,401840,pretty low odds so let's compare that to
eWbQFZWroDs,401840,403759,chick-fil-a i've seen stats saying that
eWbQFZWroDs,403759,405600,anywhere between twenty thousand and
eWbQFZWroDs,405600,407520,sixty thousand people express interest
eWbQFZWroDs,407520,409759,in becoming a franchisee every year and
eWbQFZWroDs,409759,411039,of those do you want to guess how many
eWbQFZWroDs,411039,413360,people actually make the cut 80 last
eWbQFZWroDs,413360,415120,year it appears to have been just over a
eWbQFZWroDs,415120,417199,hundred that is an acceptance rate
eWbQFZWroDs,417199,420479,between point one and point five percent
eWbQFZWroDs,420479,423520,not one percent point one ten times
eWbQFZWroDs,423520,425680,lower than harvard's acceptance rate
eWbQFZWroDs,425680,426960,heck that is lower than your chance of
eWbQFZWroDs,426960,428720,becoming a secret service agent at one
eWbQFZWroDs,428720,430160,percent even lower than becoming an
eWbQFZWroDs,430160,432479,employee at google at point two three
eWbQFZWroDs,432479,435599,percent it is an insane statistic but
eWbQFZWroDs,435599,437520,surely a harvard degree is gonna get you
eWbQFZWroDs,437520,440000,more money right nah probably not
eWbQFZWroDs,440000,441680,according to the statistics that i found
eWbQFZWroDs,441680,443919,graduates from harvard on average earn a
eWbQFZWroDs,443919,446080,hundred thousand dollars per year six
eWbQFZWroDs,446080,447520,years after they leave the school
eWbQFZWroDs,447520,449840,they're up to about 150 000 per year
eWbQFZWroDs,449840,451840,after 10. again compare that to what we
eWbQFZWroDs,451840,453039,talked about earlier when it comes to
eWbQFZWroDs,453039,455039,mcdonald's owning a single average
eWbQFZWroDs,455039,457039,performing franchise will net you about
eWbQFZWroDs,457039,459599,150 000 per year but that's just
eWbQFZWroDs,459599,461440,mcdonald's like i mentioned chick-fil-a
eWbQFZWroDs,461440,462960,restaurants tend to be much higher
eWbQFZWroDs,462960,464960,earning with an average restaurant last
eWbQFZWroDs,464960,467360,year selling five million dollars per
eWbQFZWroDs,467360,468960,store assuming you take home five
eWbQFZWroDs,468960,470400,percent of your gross revenue that
eWbQFZWroDs,470400,472560,amounts to two hundred and fifty
eWbQFZWroDs,472560,475039,thousand dollars per year as your salary
eWbQFZWroDs,475039,476720,and again that's off of an initial
eWbQFZWroDs,476720,478720,one-time ten thousand dollar investment
eWbQFZWroDs,478720,480879,yearly tuition at harvard meanwhile is a
eWbQFZWroDs,480879,484160,54 000 per year investment so before
eWbQFZWroDs,484160,485840,you're even able to get out into that
eWbQFZWroDs,485840,487759,job market you're already in the hole
eWbQFZWroDs,487759,489759,216k
eWbQFZWroDs,489759,491520,so getting into chick-fil-a is not only
eWbQFZWroDs,491520,494160,harder but it's also cheaper and likely
eWbQFZWroDs,494160,495759,more profitable than getting into
eWbQFZWroDs,495759,497599,harvard that said i'd be very
eWbQFZWroDs,497599,499280,irresponsible if i didn't call out some
eWbQFZWroDs,499280,501039,stipulations here chick-fil-a does the
eWbQFZWroDs,501039,502639,franchise thing very differently from
eWbQFZWroDs,502639,503919,the rest of the service industry
eWbQFZWroDs,503919,505520,remember how everyone else requires you
eWbQFZWroDs,505520,507120,to have a massive net worth to get
eWbQFZWroDs,507120,508960,started well that's because you as the
eWbQFZWroDs,508960,510560,franchisee are expected to buy
eWbQFZWroDs,510560,512080,everything to get your restaurant off
eWbQFZWroDs,512080,514159,the ground all the equipment materials
eWbQFZWroDs,514159,516560,whatever it's all on you chick-fil-a
eWbQFZWroDs,516560,518640,meanwhile takes care of all of that so
eWbQFZWroDs,518640,519839,you don't need to be sitting on a
eWbQFZWroDs,519839,521919,scrooge mcduckie and pile of wealth to
eWbQFZWroDs,521919,523279,get started and while that certainly
eWbQFZWroDs,523279,526399,sounds generous in theory in food theory
eWbQFZWroDs,526399,528560,it means that chick-fil-a actually owns
eWbQFZWroDs,528560,530560,everything you don't own a darn thing in
eWbQFZWroDs,530560,532240,that restaurant if you decide to pack up
eWbQFZWroDs,532240,533839,shop it'll all go back to chick-fil-a
eWbQFZWroDs,533839,535760,and you walk away with nothing you can't
eWbQFZWroDs,535760,537760,even pass it on to your family you
eWbQFZWroDs,537760,539839,aren't really an owner hence why the job
eWbQFZWroDs,539839,542080,title here is operator meanwhile if
eWbQFZWroDs,542080,543680,you're home to coast just buy a
eWbQFZWroDs,543680,545519,franchise to hire someone else to run
eWbQFZWroDs,545519,547279,the whole thing nope not allowed
eWbQFZWroDs,547279,549200,chick-fil-a expects franchisees to be
eWbQFZWroDs,549200,550880,very hands-on with their restaurant and
eWbQFZWroDs,550880,552880,refuses to let operators have any other
eWbQFZWroDs,552880,554640,business ventures i guess they'd frown
eWbQFZWroDs,554640,556080,on me making youtube videos about them
eWbQFZWroDs,556080,558000,while i also ran one of their locations
eWbQFZWroDs,558000,560240,and you do have to be hands-on reading
eWbQFZWroDs,560240,561360,everything that i could about
eWbQFZWroDs,561360,563120,franchising restaurants everyone seems
eWbQFZWroDs,563120,565519,to agree on that regardless of the
eWbQFZWroDs,565519,567120,franchise you're talking about if you're
eWbQFZWroDs,567120,569200,the owner you are constantly supervising
eWbQFZWroDs,569200,571040,every element of the business there is
eWbQFZWroDs,571040,572959,no rest when employees are going in and
eWbQFZWroDs,572959,574560,out of this thing like a revolving door
eWbQFZWroDs,574560,576800,so you're working hard for all the money
eWbQFZWroDs,576800,578720,you're earning the upside for owners of
eWbQFZWroDs,578720,580320,places like mcdonald's is that in
eWbQFZWroDs,580320,582320,success most owners are able to operate
eWbQFZWroDs,582320,584320,multiple locations which allows them to
eWbQFZWroDs,584320,587360,generate some fat stacks 150 000 from a
eWbQFZWroDs,587360,588959,single restaurant per year yeah it's
eWbQFZWroDs,588959,591839,great but 150k per year from seven
eWbQFZWroDs,591839,594480,restaurants oh now you're talking
eWbQFZWroDs,594480,596080,however unlike other fast food
eWbQFZWroDs,596080,598000,franchises you can't do that at
eWbQFZWroDs,598000,599680,chick-fil-a you have to earn your way up
eWbQFZWroDs,599680,603519,to merit too and at max maybe three
eWbQFZWroDs,603519,605360,chick-fil-a locations why are they so
eWbQFZWroDs,605360,606320,different because they don't want
eWbQFZWroDs,606320,608240,franchisees to just be people with lots
eWbQFZWroDs,608240,609839,of money sitting around in an office
eWbQFZWroDs,609839,611760,they want people that are hands-on if
eWbQFZWroDs,611760,613440,you become a franchisee you are signing
eWbQFZWroDs,613440,614880,yourself up for a six day a week
eWbQFZWroDs,614880,616640,position running the restaurant and when
eWbQFZWroDs,616640,618000,you think about the chick-fil-a model
eWbQFZWroDs,618000,620000,relative to the other models of qsrs
eWbQFZWroDs,620000,622320,that you visit it actually makes sense i
eWbQFZWroDs,622320,624399,mean i can only speak anecdotally but in
eWbQFZWroDs,624399,626480,general i eat a lot of fast food and i
eWbQFZWroDs,626480,628000,notice when things in the restaurant
eWbQFZWroDs,628000,630000,aren't really run well chick-fil-a tends
eWbQFZWroDs,630000,631839,to get fewer orders wrong run more
eWbQFZWroDs,631839,633680,efficiently and have consistent service
eWbQFZWroDs,633680,635279,at least at all the places that i visit
eWbQFZWroDs,635279,637200,here in north carolina and california
eWbQFZWroDs,637200,639040,this is because the franchise operators
eWbQFZWroDs,639040,641200,are there all the time breathing down
eWbQFZWroDs,641200,643360,their employees necks micromanaging
eWbQFZWroDs,643360,644800,checking in everything good for
eWbQFZWroDs,644800,647040,consumers like me no doubt but i also
eWbQFZWroDs,647040,648240,imagine it's probably a lot more
eWbQFZWroDs,648240,650079,stressful to be an employee in that sort
eWbQFZWroDs,650079,651760,of environment that's in contrast to
eWbQFZWroDs,651760,653680,most of the mcdonald's locations that i
eWbQFZWroDs,653680,655360,visit whose employees occasionally
eWbQFZWroDs,655360,657120,saunter over to the cash register and
eWbQFZWroDs,657120,659600,where there's a literal 25 accuracy on
eWbQFZWroDs,659600,661279,my order the model certainly isn't the
eWbQFZWroDs,661279,663040,best for me as the consumer but it's
eWbQFZWroDs,663040,664640,certainly great for the franchise owner
eWbQFZWroDs,664640,666079,who's sitting on a mountain of cash
eWbQFZWroDs,666079,668079,somewhere from their 10 franchises it
eWbQFZWroDs,668079,670079,also encourages the mcdonald's brand to
eWbQFZWroDs,670079,672160,spread everywhere being as wide as it
eWbQFZWroDs,672160,674079,possibly can be because everyone wants
eWbQFZWroDs,674079,676320,to open one and they can open dozens my
eWbQFZWroDs,676320,678320,point in all of this is that there's so
eWbQFZWroDs,678320,679920,much that we don't see under the surface
eWbQFZWroDs,679920,681279,of the restaurants that we go to every
eWbQFZWroDs,681279,684000,day or just me going to every day it's
eWbQFZWroDs,684000,685680,it's probably just me right the question
eWbQFZWroDs,685680,688079,is if you can own a qsr restaurant
eWbQFZWroDs,688079,689760,should you or are you better off going
eWbQFZWroDs,689760,691760,to harvard well in an interesting twist
eWbQFZWroDs,691760,694079,the answer is yeah own the restaurant
eWbQFZWroDs,694079,695760,you start making money as a franchise
eWbQFZWroDs,695760,697600,owner immediately rather than waiting
eWbQFZWroDs,697600,698800,four years and home to get an
eWbQFZWroDs,698800,700480,entry-level job to start chipping away
eWbQFZWroDs,700480,702480,at your debt and even at six years out
eWbQFZWroDs,702480,704240,of college when your experience trumps
eWbQFZWroDs,704240,706000,your education anyway franchise owners
eWbQFZWroDs,706000,707920,are still likely making a higher average
eWbQFZWroDs,707920,710160,salary than the average harvard graduate
eWbQFZWroDs,710160,712079,again with less debt and now with an
eWbQFZWroDs,712079,714000,incredibly substantial resume item
eWbQFZWroDs,714000,716320,owning and running their own business
eWbQFZWroDs,716320,717920,after four years of being a franchise
eWbQFZWroDs,717920,719680,owner you can go on to run other types
eWbQFZWroDs,719680,721120,of restaurants you can open up more of
eWbQFZWroDs,721120,722800,your current restaurant you can go into
eWbQFZWroDs,722800,724240,high-end management positions at
eWbQFZWroDs,724240,726079,companies or start your own brand new
eWbQFZWroDs,726079,728079,business with your profits after four
eWbQFZWroDs,728079,729680,years at harvard you can finally move
eWbQFZWroDs,729680,732079,out of your 160 square foot dorm grab as
eWbQFZWroDs,732079,733279,much out of your parents fridge in
eWbQFZWroDs,733279,734880,connecticut as you can get away with and
eWbQFZWroDs,734880,737200,line up for an entry-level job somewhere
eWbQFZWroDs,737200,739120,somehow bizarrely this doesn't even seem
eWbQFZWroDs,739120,740720,to be a close race even as a guy who
eWbQFZWroDs,740720,742560,went to a fancy pants college i am now
eWbQFZWroDs,742560,743760,thinking that i should have picked up a
eWbQFZWroDs,743760,745360,subway instead at the end of the day
eWbQFZWroDs,745360,747120,college tends to teach concepts in
eWbQFZWroDs,747120,748959,theory and you know i love me some
eWbQFZWroDs,748959,750800,theories but being a franchise owner
eWbQFZWroDs,750800,752959,teaches concepts by experience which
eWbQFZWroDs,752959,754560,means that you're not just earning a
eWbQFZWroDs,754560,757279,living you're learning a living which is
eWbQFZWroDs,757279,760000,pretty much the ideal but hey maybe all
eWbQFZWroDs,760000,761360,this talk about fast food chains has
eWbQFZWroDs,761360,762959,made you hungry or maybe you're like me
eWbQFZWroDs,762959,764399,and trying to be healthier by cutting
eWbQFZWroDs,764399,765839,down on the amount of fast food that
eWbQFZWroDs,765839,767760,you're eating every week thankfully we
eWbQFZWroDs,767760,769920,were once again reached out to by noob

eWbQFZWroDs,773519,775600,do research for these episodes but i've

eWbQFZWroDs,782480,784480,my eating habits it may seem like i just
eWbQFZWroDs,784480,786160,wanted another bite of that gloriously
eWbQFZWroDs,786160,787680,greasy breaded chicken but there were
eWbQFZWroDs,787680,789519,really much deeper reasons behind my
eWbQFZWroDs,789519,791200,choices and thanks to noobs support
