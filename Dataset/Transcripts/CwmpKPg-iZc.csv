CwmpKPg-iZc,20480,21920,the end i also show you guys the workout
CwmpKPg-iZc,21920,23600,that i love doing after taking a big
CwmpKPg-iZc,23600,25199,break from working out
CwmpKPg-iZc,25199,26880,so we've all been there you know i know
CwmpKPg-iZc,26880,28560,that i have at first you start off
CwmpKPg-iZc,28560,30160,you're in the groove you're working out
CwmpKPg-iZc,30160,31439,all the time you're eating healthy
CwmpKPg-iZc,31439,32960,you're feeling super motivated and then
CwmpKPg-iZc,32960,34800,one day you decide to take a break a few
CwmpKPg-iZc,34800,37200,days goes by a few weeks goes by a few
CwmpKPg-iZc,37200,39680,months goes by maybe even a year goes by
CwmpKPg-iZc,39680,41120,and you find yourself feeling super
CwmpKPg-iZc,41120,43440,unmotivated and in a fitness slump and
CwmpKPg-iZc,43440,44640,i'm guessing you clicked on this video
CwmpKPg-iZc,44640,46239,because you're feeling that way and
CwmpKPg-iZc,46239,47440,first of all i just want you to know
CwmpKPg-iZc,47440,49520,that you are not alone okay i've been
CwmpKPg-iZc,49520,51600,through that slump so many times working
CwmpKPg-iZc,51600,53440,out like crazy and then stopping and
CwmpKPg-iZc,53440,54719,then getting back into it and then
CwmpKPg-iZc,54719,56800,stopping it's just a vicious cycle i
CwmpKPg-iZc,56800,58480,probably went through that cycle more
CwmpKPg-iZc,58480,60320,times than i can count until one day i
CwmpKPg-iZc,60320,61680,decided that i don't want to feel this
CwmpKPg-iZc,61680,63280,way anymore i want to get out of this
CwmpKPg-iZc,63280,64960,fitness slump and i want to get back
CwmpKPg-iZc,64960,67040,into it and if my lazy ass can do it you
CwmpKPg-iZc,67040,68880,can do it too it is never too late to
CwmpKPg-iZc,68880,70799,get back into working out or even start
CwmpKPg-iZc,70799,72320,working out clicking on this video is
CwmpKPg-iZc,72320,74240,the first step so you're doing great i'm
CwmpKPg-iZc,74240,76400,proud of you also shout out to gymshark
CwmpKPg-iZc,76400,78320,for sponsoring today's video
CwmpKPg-iZc,78320,79680,so there's usually three main reasons
CwmpKPg-iZc,79680,81280,why you're not feeling motivated the
CwmpKPg-iZc,81280,82479,first is that you took a break from
CwmpKPg-iZc,82479,84240,working out and can't find motivation to
CwmpKPg-iZc,84240,86320,get back in it so the first one i feel
CwmpKPg-iZc,86320,88479,this so hard and i felt this so many
CwmpKPg-iZc,88479,90240,times throughout my fitness journey like
CwmpKPg-iZc,90240,91600,i don't even know how to count so when
CwmpKPg-iZc,91600,92799,you first take a break you're like oh
CwmpKPg-iZc,92799,95040,i'll just take one day my time goes by
CwmpKPg-iZc,95040,96960,and then you realize actually i want to
CwmpKPg-iZc,96960,100079,take a longer break because
CwmpKPg-iZc,100079,101680,you know what's another day or another
CwmpKPg-iZc,101680,103280,week and when you get into that mindset
CwmpKPg-iZc,103280,104960,it just continues and then you continue
CwmpKPg-iZc,104960,107040,to give yourself a break until you just
CwmpKPg-iZc,107040,108880,fully feel so unmotivated that you don't
CwmpKPg-iZc,108880,110399,even want to get back into it anymore so
CwmpKPg-iZc,110399,112240,the first way to fix that is to have a
CwmpKPg-iZc,112240,114079,mindset change you need to tell yourself
CwmpKPg-iZc,114079,116320,that you didn't fall off because you
CwmpKPg-iZc,116320,118640,didn't you need to see you falling off
CwmpKPg-iZc,118640,120799,as a necessary break and believe it or
CwmpKPg-iZc,120799,122960,not your body needs these breaks to
CwmpKPg-iZc,122960,124960,recover that's why you need rest days
CwmpKPg-iZc,124960,125920,because if you're working out every
CwmpKPg-iZc,125920,127680,single day your body doesn't have time
CwmpKPg-iZc,127680,129920,to repair those teared muscles so listen
CwmpKPg-iZc,129920,131760,i don't care if your break was a few
CwmpKPg-iZc,131760,133680,days or maybe even a year however long
CwmpKPg-iZc,133680,136160,it was it was a necessary break for you
CwmpKPg-iZc,136160,137920,and that's something you need to drill
CwmpKPg-iZc,137920,139360,into your head it's not because you're
CwmpKPg-iZc,139360,140879,lazy it's not because you don't have any
CwmpKPg-iZc,140879,142400,discipline you need to get out of that
CwmpKPg-iZc,142400,144319,blaming mindset and you need to forgive
CwmpKPg-iZc,144319,146400,yourself ease into it and second you
CwmpKPg-iZc,146400,148800,cannot solely rely on motivation to keep
CwmpKPg-iZc,148800,150560,you going in your fitness journey i have
CwmpKPg-iZc,150560,152239,so many days where i wake up and the
CwmpKPg-iZc,152239,154400,last thing i want to do is get out of my
CwmpKPg-iZc,154400,157040,bed let alone haul my ass to the gym to
CwmpKPg-iZc,157040,158879,put my body in pain for like an hour you
CwmpKPg-iZc,158879,160640,know so instead you have to think of it
CwmpKPg-iZc,160640,162560,as a fitness journey there's gonna be
CwmpKPg-iZc,162560,164080,ups there's gonna be downs but if you
CwmpKPg-iZc,164080,165760,look at your overall journey from point
CwmpKPg-iZc,165760,168800,a to point z you see how far you've come
CwmpKPg-iZc,168800,170160,and that's what's important every
CwmpKPg-iZc,170160,172080,workout that you do at the time that you
CwmpKPg-iZc,172080,174000,don't feel like working out is a win
CwmpKPg-iZc,174000,176319,every workout counts every win counts in
CwmpKPg-iZc,176319,177920,your fitness journey so sometimes you
CwmpKPg-iZc,177920,180239,just gotta pop some pre-workout in and
CwmpKPg-iZc,180239,181840,get your butt into the gym i'm telling
CwmpKPg-iZc,181840,183519,you guys that getting your butt into the
CwmpKPg-iZc,183519,185840,gym is probably the hardest part and the
CwmpKPg-iZc,185840,187760,actual working out isn't even that hard
CwmpKPg-iZc,187760,189120,the second reason is that you're growing
CwmpKPg-iZc,189120,190959,bored of your routine slash working out
CwmpKPg-iZc,190959,192560,you're probably growing bored of your
CwmpKPg-iZc,192560,194080,routine and this is because you're
CwmpKPg-iZc,194080,195760,probably getting tired of doing the same
CwmpKPg-iZc,195760,197280,damn thing every single time you're
CwmpKPg-iZc,197280,198640,working out and so it's important to
CwmpKPg-iZc,198640,200319,make working out not something like a
CwmpKPg-iZc,200319,202000,chore or something like annoying that
CwmpKPg-iZc,202000,204159,you have to do i always say that fitness
CwmpKPg-iZc,204159,206159,is like a long-term relationship okay
CwmpKPg-iZc,206159,207760,when you're in it for so long the same
CwmpKPg-iZc,207760,209599,things don't excite you as much anymore
CwmpKPg-iZc,209599,211200,you're out of the honeymoon phase it's
CwmpKPg-iZc,211200,213120,starting to lose that spark so like a
CwmpKPg-iZc,213120,214560,long-term relationship you gotta spice
CwmpKPg-iZc,214560,216319,it up you gotta make it fun so it's
CwmpKPg-iZc,216319,218159,important to maybe try something new
CwmpKPg-iZc,218159,220319,like just a few months back i became so
CwmpKPg-iZc,220319,222000,sick of weightlifting like you guys
CwmpKPg-iZc,222000,224400,don't understand okay the sight of a
CwmpKPg-iZc,224400,226480,dumbbell or a barbell like i just wanted
CwmpKPg-iZc,226480,228239,to fling that out the window so it's
CwmpKPg-iZc,228239,229920,important to try new things and
CwmpKPg-iZc,229920,231440,implement new things into your workout
CwmpKPg-iZc,231440,233599,routine so i started jump roping
CwmpKPg-iZc,233599,235840,sprinting which is a big deal because
CwmpKPg-iZc,235840,237599,you all know anything about me i hate
CwmpKPg-iZc,237599,239200,running like and even boxing when you
CwmpKPg-iZc,239200,240640,spice up your routine a little bit it
CwmpKPg-iZc,240640,242799,makes it more fun and another tip is to
CwmpKPg-iZc,242799,244560,make workout playlists this is so
CwmpKPg-iZc,244560,247120,underrated i am a self-proclaimed master
CwmpKPg-iZc,247120,249519,spotify playlist maker i make tons of
CwmpKPg-iZc,249519,251040,playlists on my free time just for my
CwmpKPg-iZc,251040,252959,own enjoyment you know making a fire
CwmpKPg-iZc,252959,254799,spotify playlist makes or breaks your
CwmpKPg-iZc,254799,256639,whole workout so before you go work out
CwmpKPg-iZc,256639,258880,you know curate your own playlist make
CwmpKPg-iZc,258880,261040,it cute put a cute cover on it put your
CwmpKPg-iZc,261040,262880,favorite music like the music that hypes
CwmpKPg-iZc,262880,264560,you up put that in the playlist and
CwmpKPg-iZc,264560,266320,blast it in your headphones like blast
CwmpKPg-iZc,266320,268240,it on your way to the gym in the car get
CwmpKPg-iZc,268240,270000,yourself hyped up get yourself excited
CwmpKPg-iZc,270000,271680,you know i try to make working out like
CwmpKPg-iZc,271680,273840,a whole experience you know i have my
CwmpKPg-iZc,273840,275759,workout playlist ready and when i go to
CwmpKPg-iZc,275759,277440,the gym i have my pre-workout in my
CwmpKPg-iZc,277440,279280,system already and i put on my
CwmpKPg-iZc,279280,281680,headphones and i blast my music when i'm
CwmpKPg-iZc,281680,283840,at the gym it's like my space it's like
CwmpKPg-iZc,283840,285759,my sanctuary i'm there to work out and
CwmpKPg-iZc,285759,287440,have a good time so sometimes i like
CwmpKPg-iZc,287440,289520,dance to my music i like bob my head to
CwmpKPg-iZc,289520,291680,the music in between my sets not that
CwmpKPg-iZc,291680,292880,you have to do that okay but i'm just
CwmpKPg-iZc,292880,294080,saying that that's one of the things
CwmpKPg-iZc,294080,296639,that i do personally to make working out
CwmpKPg-iZc,296639,298560,more fun and my last tip is that when
CwmpKPg-iZc,298560,300639,you look cute you feel cute and
CwmpKPg-iZc,300639,302639,sometimes that's enough to make you want
CwmpKPg-iZc,302639,304800,to work out that is my excuse as to why
CwmpKPg-iZc,304800,306960,i spend so much on workout clothes i
CwmpKPg-iZc,306960,308960,should probably stop i love putting on
CwmpKPg-iZc,308960,310560,new workout gear it just makes me more
CwmpKPg-iZc,310560,312880,excited and when i feel like a baddie
CwmpKPg-iZc,312880,314720,i'm like ready to crush my workout and

CwmpKPg-iZc,363280,364880,and you're ready to crush your workout
CwmpKPg-iZc,364880,366880,the last reason is lack of discipline
CwmpKPg-iZc,366880,368720,and not seeing results this last tip i'm
CwmpKPg-iZc,368720,370240,gonna be a little harsh okay if you
CwmpKPg-iZc,370240,371520,think that you're gonna see results in
CwmpKPg-iZc,371520,373199,literally a week you should just stop
CwmpKPg-iZc,373199,375360,now okay because that's just never gonna
CwmpKPg-iZc,375360,377199,happen it's just not realistic but you
CwmpKPg-iZc,377199,378960,know this is not to hate because i know
CwmpKPg-iZc,378960,380479,i've been there i remember when i used
CwmpKPg-iZc,380479,382160,to do like two squats and then i would
CwmpKPg-iZc,382160,383520,check in the mirror right after and be
CwmpKPg-iZc,383520,385039,like oh my god did my booty get bigger
CwmpKPg-iZc,385039,387120,but yeah it is a journey you know if we
CwmpKPg-iZc,387120,389120,could see results super fast shoot we'd
CwmpKPg-iZc,389120,391039,all be like killing it in the olympics
CwmpKPg-iZc,391039,392319,or something it's going to take hard
CwmpKPg-iZc,392319,393759,work it's going to take discipline
CwmpKPg-iZc,393759,395600,you're gonna have to keep on going even
CwmpKPg-iZc,395600,397039,when you don't see results right away
CwmpKPg-iZc,397039,398800,and that is when discipline comes in
CwmpKPg-iZc,398800,400560,there are a lot of ways to create your
CwmpKPg-iZc,400560,402639,discipline in your fitness journey first
CwmpKPg-iZc,402639,404880,is to write out your workouts beforehand
CwmpKPg-iZc,404880,406720,i probably have like a hundred different
CwmpKPg-iZc,406720,408720,workouts written out in my phone and
CwmpKPg-iZc,408720,410479,that way before you go to the gym you
CwmpKPg-iZc,410479,412240,already know what workout you're doing
CwmpKPg-iZc,412240,413599,and so you don't have to like be in the
CwmpKPg-iZc,413599,415440,gym trying to figure it out it saves a
CwmpKPg-iZc,415440,417360,lot of stress and anxiety also it really
CwmpKPg-iZc,417360,419440,helps to write in your calendar what
CwmpKPg-iZc,419440,421599,muscle group you're hitting that day and
CwmpKPg-iZc,421599,423520,writing out like when exactly you're
CwmpKPg-iZc,423520,424880,going to be working out and when you do
CwmpKPg-iZc,424880,426319,that chances are you're actually going
CwmpKPg-iZc,426319,428479,to stick to it also set alarms so if you
CwmpKPg-iZc,428479,429759,guys want to see what my alarm looks
CwmpKPg-iZc,429759,432000,like
CwmpKPg-iZc,433120,435039,it just keeps going wait this is not
CwmpKPg-iZc,435039,437199,even all of it i need to set alarms like
CwmpKPg-iZc,437199,438960,an hour or 30 minutes before i have to
CwmpKPg-iZc,438960,440319,work out because when i hear that
CwmpKPg-iZc,440319,442639,blaring sound i'm like okay it's go time

CwmpKPg-iZc,521360,523360,get my body warmed up a little bit after
