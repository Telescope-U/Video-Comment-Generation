aje9UGNi_l0,80,1599,it's a very defeating feeling when we
aje9UGNi_l0,1599,3120,want to get things done but we feel
aje9UGNi_l0,3120,5600,completely drained and so luckily there
aje9UGNi_l0,5600,7440,is an ever-growing body of research that
aje9UGNi_l0,7440,9920,suggests nutrition and our food choices
aje9UGNi_l0,9920,11840,can actually help to fight fatigue
aje9UGNi_l0,11840,13679,during the day and it can also help us
aje9UGNi_l0,13679,17920,sleep more quickly and soundly at night
aje9UGNi_l0,18320,19840,fatigue can be brought on by different
aje9UGNi_l0,19840,21520,causes like a decrease in physical
aje9UGNi_l0,21520,23760,activity or allergies or diabetes but
aje9UGNi_l0,23760,25760,today we're specifically going to focus
aje9UGNi_l0,25760,28080,on how fatigue can be brought on but
aje9UGNi_l0,28080,30240,also resolved by our food and beverage
aje9UGNi_l0,30240,32000,choices so myself and one of our
aje9UGNi_l0,32000,34239,dietitian team members sophia we geeked
aje9UGNi_l0,34239,35680,out and we read a whole bunch of
aje9UGNi_l0,35680,37520,research papers on the link between
aje9UGNi_l0,37520,39600,nutrition and fatigue and we've
aje9UGNi_l0,39600,41280,simplified what is known in the science
aje9UGNi_l0,41280,42000,and that's what we're going to share
aje9UGNi_l0,42000,43440,with you in today's video we also
aje9UGNi_l0,43440,45760,created an uncomplicated article that's
aje9UGNi_l0,45760,47200,just going to help to support this video
aje9UGNi_l0,47200,48640,even worse if you want to delve deeper
aje9UGNi_l0,48640,50000,i'm going to link that for you below but
aje9UGNi_l0,50000,52660,for now let's dive right in
aje9UGNi_l0,52660,54399,[Music]
aje9UGNi_l0,54399,55920,our bodies have an internal clock that
aje9UGNi_l0,55920,57760,impacts when we sleep and wake up and
aje9UGNi_l0,57760,60079,this is called our circadian rhythm our
aje9UGNi_l0,60079,62239,circadian rhythm is very strongly linked
aje9UGNi_l0,62239,64239,to dark and light cycles so when it's
aje9UGNi_l0,64239,66080,more light outside we tend to feel more
aje9UGNi_l0,66080,68320,awake and when it's dark we tend to feel
aje9UGNi_l0,68320,70320,more tired now there's an emerging field
aje9UGNi_l0,70320,72400,of science called chrononutrition which
aje9UGNi_l0,72400,74720,studies how our eating behaviors can
aje9UGNi_l0,74720,77040,also influence the circadian rhythm like
aje9UGNi_l0,77040,78720,some recent studies for example have
aje9UGNi_l0,78720,81040,shown that eating irregularly can throw
aje9UGNi_l0,81040,83040,our circadian rhythm out of sync which
aje9UGNi_l0,83040,85439,can reduce the quality and duration of
aje9UGNi_l0,85439,87840,our sleep so ensuring that we eat at
aje9UGNi_l0,87840,90079,more or less the same times each day can
aje9UGNi_l0,90079,91680,actually help to synchronize our
aje9UGNi_l0,91680,94079,sleep-wake cycle making us feel less
aje9UGNi_l0,94079,96560,tired
aje9UGNi_l0,97600,99840,breakfast isn't for everyone i get that
aje9UGNi_l0,99840,100960,but if you are somebody who kind of
aje9UGNi_l0,100960,102479,feels chronically fatigued throughout
aje9UGNi_l0,102479,104079,the day and you're also skipping
aje9UGNi_l0,104079,106240,breakfast this could be the culprit so
aje9UGNi_l0,106240,108079,after we've had like a good night's rest
aje9UGNi_l0,108079,109680,we've been fasting for many hours
aje9UGNi_l0,109680,111439,because we've been asleep and so when we
aje9UGNi_l0,111439,113600,wake up we're a bit depleted in energy
aje9UGNi_l0,113600,115840,and so breaking the fast which is where
aje9UGNi_l0,115840,117439,the word breakfast actually comes from
aje9UGNi_l0,117439,119119,this helps to kick-start our day with
aje9UGNi_l0,119119,120960,some fuel there's been several studies
aje9UGNi_l0,120960,122240,that have shown that those who eat
aje9UGNi_l0,122240,124000,breakfast especially high-fiber
aje9UGNi_l0,124000,125920,breakfasts are not only more alert
aje9UGNi_l0,125920,127600,throughout the day but they also have
aje9UGNi_l0,127600,130080,improved memory a more positive mood and
aje9UGNi_l0,130080,132000,even better bowel movements there's also
aje9UGNi_l0,132000,134160,this one interesting study of 498
aje9UGNi_l0,134160,135840,students that found that those who were
aje9UGNi_l0,135840,137360,skipping breakfast were also the ones
aje9UGNi_l0,137360,138720,reporting that they weren't sleeping as
aje9UGNi_l0,138720,140640,well at night so not only does eating
aje9UGNi_l0,140640,142080,breakfast kind of give us more energy
aje9UGNi_l0,142080,144000,throughout the day it could potentially
aje9UGNi_l0,144000,146080,also help us sleep better so it's a
aje9UGNi_l0,146080,148560,win-win
aje9UGNi_l0,149599,151599,this is what i love about nutrition it
aje9UGNi_l0,151599,153599,turns out that we can very strategically
aje9UGNi_l0,153599,156000,compose our meals to help us feel more
aje9UGNi_l0,156000,157840,alert during the day and to help us kind
aje9UGNi_l0,157840,160000,of fall asleep and better stay asleep at
aje9UGNi_l0,160000,161519,night so let's explore why that's the
aje9UGNi_l0,161519,163519,case starting with proteins a protein is
aje9UGNi_l0,163519,164959,made up of these building blocks that
aje9UGNi_l0,164959,166879,are called amino acids one of which is
aje9UGNi_l0,166879,169120,tryptophan tryptophan gets taken to our
aje9UGNi_l0,169120,170879,brain where it's absorbed and that gets
aje9UGNi_l0,170879,172959,converted to serotonin which helps us
aje9UGNi_l0,172959,175599,feel good and calm that gets converted
aje9UGNi_l0,175599,177760,to melatonin which is a hormone that
aje9UGNi_l0,177760,179200,actually helps our body kind of get
aje9UGNi_l0,179200,181120,ready for sleep the research showed that
aje9UGNi_l0,181120,183280,people who sleep well tended to consume
aje9UGNi_l0,183280,185200,more protein over the day than people
aje9UGNi_l0,185200,187040,who sleep poorly notable plant-based
aje9UGNi_l0,187040,189360,food sources of tryptophan are soy nuts
aje9UGNi_l0,189360,191280,and seeds including cashew pumpkin and
aje9UGNi_l0,191280,193920,sunflower seeds beans leafy greens
aje9UGNi_l0,193920,196480,mushrooms and broccoli so it's important
aje9UGNi_l0,196480,198159,that we get enough protein so that we
aje9UGNi_l0,198159,199680,get the tryptophan but it's worth noting
aje9UGNi_l0,199680,200800,that you don't want to get too much
aje9UGNi_l0,200800,202239,protein because that's been linked with
aje9UGNi_l0,202239,204560,decreasing sleep quality so no need to
aje9UGNi_l0,204560,206560,go out and take any protein powders as
aje9UGNi_l0,206560,208080,long as you're following a foods first
aje9UGNi_l0,208080,210080,approach now let's delve into the carbs
aje9UGNi_l0,210080,211760,i have for simplicity's sake broken this
aje9UGNi_l0,211760,213599,up into two different groups
aje9UGNi_l0,213599,215120,one of which we're going to call slow
aje9UGNi_l0,215120,218080,digesting carbs and one quick digesting
aje9UGNi_l0,218080,220640,carbs quick digesting carbs are those
aje9UGNi_l0,220640,223599,like white bread white pasta and white
aje9UGNi_l0,223599,225599,rice slow digesting carbs on the other
aje9UGNi_l0,225599,227760,hand are those that are higher in fiber
aje9UGNi_l0,227760,230080,so think whole grains legumes and
aje9UGNi_l0,230080,232080,vegetables what's interesting is that
aje9UGNi_l0,232080,234239,fruits have a bit of a mix of both okay
aje9UGNi_l0,234239,235920,so why is knowing all of this important
aje9UGNi_l0,235920,238480,in short eating quick digesting carbs
aje9UGNi_l0,238480,240000,increases the amount of tryptophan that
aje9UGNi_l0,240000,241760,gets absorbed into our brain which is
aje9UGNi_l0,241760,243200,then going to increase the chance that
aje9UGNi_l0,243200,245200,we're going to feel sleepy after eating
aje9UGNi_l0,245200,246879,and this is what's so cool we can use
aje9UGNi_l0,246879,249040,this knowledge to our benefit like in
aje9UGNi_l0,249040,251120,the evening we can increase the chances
aje9UGNi_l0,251120,252879,of becoming sleepy a few hours after
aje9UGNi_l0,252879,255280,dinner by having quick carbs with our
aje9UGNi_l0,255280,256880,dinner meal or by having a piece of
aje9UGNi_l0,256880,258639,fruit with dinner or as an evening snack
aje9UGNi_l0,258639,260239,just to help to increase the absorption
aje9UGNi_l0,260239,262479,of tryptophan into our brain on the
aje9UGNi_l0,262479,264800,other hand if we want to avoid the after
aje9UGNi_l0,264800,266240,lunch slump that we can experience
aje9UGNi_l0,266240,267919,sometimes we can try to have slow
aje9UGNi_l0,267919,270160,digesting carbs with our meal instead of
aje9UGNi_l0,270160,272160,quick digesting carbs in addition to
aje9UGNi_l0,272160,274080,them just being great sources of fiber
aje9UGNi_l0,274080,275759,these slow digesting carbs give us a
aje9UGNi_l0,275759,277680,more steady and continued release of
aje9UGNi_l0,277680,280800,energy throughout the
aje9UGNi_l0,280840,283440,day being deficient in certain nutrients
aje9UGNi_l0,283440,284880,can really affect sleep this is
aje9UGNi_l0,284880,286479,something we found across a whole bunch
aje9UGNi_l0,286479,288320,of different research papers where if
aje9UGNi_l0,288320,290800,certain people are deficient for example
aje9UGNi_l0,290800,293360,in iron magnesium potassium zinc
aje9UGNi_l0,293360,296160,selenium beta-carotene b vitamins and
aje9UGNi_l0,296160,299120,vitamins c e and or d they tend to sleep
aje9UGNi_l0,299120,300800,more poorly now these vitamins and
aje9UGNi_l0,300800,302800,minerals they take part in a whole bunch
aje9UGNi_l0,302800,304160,of the different complex reactions that
aje9UGNi_l0,304160,306479,occur in our body so like iron for
aje9UGNi_l0,306479,308479,example helps with the production of
aje9UGNi_l0,308479,310400,serotonin whereas b vitamins help to
aje9UGNi_l0,310400,312560,create melatonin but there's no need to
aje9UGNi_l0,312560,314000,go out and supplement with these
aje9UGNi_l0,314000,315520,vitamins and minerals unless your doctor
aje9UGNi_l0,315520,317600,has specifically advised that you do but
aje9UGNi_l0,317600,319919,that's mainly because our philosophy is
aje9UGNi_l0,319919,322160,to follow a food first approach it is
aje9UGNi_l0,322160,324320,definitely possible and recommended to
aje9UGNi_l0,324320,325680,get kind of the nutrients that we need
aje9UGNi_l0,325680,327280,just by eating a variety of different
aje9UGNi_l0,327280,329039,plant foods and so if you're curious on
aje9UGNi_l0,329039,331440,how to build your plate so that it is
aje9UGNi_l0,331440,333520,nutritionally balanced and adequate you
aje9UGNi_l0,333520,334880,can check out our plate method video if
aje9UGNi_l0,334880,335919,you'd like and i'll link that for you
aje9UGNi_l0,335919,336800,here
aje9UGNi_l0,336800,337759,so we're going to take a brief
aje9UGNi_l0,337759,339199,intermission to share two different
aje9UGNi_l0,339199,340560,evening snacks that you can enjoy that
aje9UGNi_l0,340560,342080,can actually help to promote sleep and
aje9UGNi_l0,342080,343919,it's a great opportunity for us to put
aje9UGNi_l0,343919,345199,into practice what we've learned
aje9UGNi_l0,345199,347199,starting off with just simple banana and
aje9UGNi_l0,347199,349199,nut butter both bananas and almond
aje9UGNi_l0,349199,350800,butter contain tryptophan and when you
aje9UGNi_l0,350800,352479,combine that with the quick digesting
aje9UGNi_l0,352479,354000,carbs that are in the banana the
aje9UGNi_l0,354000,355840,tryptophan absorption in our brains is
aje9UGNi_l0,355840,357520,increased what's more is that these are
aje9UGNi_l0,357520,359520,both high in magnesium and bananas are
aje9UGNi_l0,359520,361039,high in potassium which are a couple of
aje9UGNi_l0,361039,362400,the minerals that we just previously
aje9UGNi_l0,362400,363919,talked about
aje9UGNi_l0,363919,365680,here's another option in place of having
aje9UGNi_l0,365680,367120,an evening tea that might have some
aje9UGNi_l0,367120,368800,caffeine in it you could try out some
aje9UGNi_l0,368800,371039,warm soy milk instead this contains
aje9UGNi_l0,371039,373440,tryptophan but also magnesium and
aje9UGNi_l0,373440,374960,calcium and if you'd prefer that the
aje9UGNi_l0,374960,376720,milk is flavored you could try out our
aje9UGNi_l0,376720,378720,homemade golden latte mix it's really
aje9UGNi_l0,378720,380960,delicious and it makes for a comforting
aje9UGNi_l0,380960,383270,drink that also helps to promote sleep
aje9UGNi_l0,383270,385759,[Music]
aje9UGNi_l0,385759,387440,so we all know that caffeine which is
aje9UGNi_l0,387440,389280,found in coffee most predominantly but
aje9UGNi_l0,389280,391600,also in energy drinks and in tea that
aje9UGNi_l0,391600,393600,this helps to make us feel more alert
aje9UGNi_l0,393600,395120,right and this is because it's a
aje9UGNi_l0,395120,397039,stimulant that temporarily suppresses
aje9UGNi_l0,397039,399600,the buildup of sleep pressure which is a
aje9UGNi_l0,399600,401600,mechanism that makes us tired now
aje9UGNi_l0,401600,403440,everyone is different but in most adults
aje9UGNi_l0,403440,405360,it takes the body about three to seven
aje9UGNi_l0,405360,407919,hours to break down half of the caffeine
aje9UGNi_l0,407919,409840,that's in our system this is known as
aje9UGNi_l0,409840,411919,its half-life so let's say that we drink
aje9UGNi_l0,411919,414479,our first cup of coffee at 9 a.m five
aje9UGNi_l0,414479,416479,hours later at 2 p.m there's still going
aje9UGNi_l0,416479,418319,to be half of that caffeine in our
aje9UGNi_l0,418319,420880,system and then another 5 hours later at
aje9UGNi_l0,420880,423520,7 00 pm a quarter of what we drank at
aje9UGNi_l0,423520,425599,9am is still going to be in our system
aje9UGNi_l0,425599,427039,and then by the time it's midnight we're
aje9UGNi_l0,427039,428960,going to have an eighth of that caffeine
aje9UGNi_l0,428960,430479,still in our system it's pretty
aje9UGNi_l0,430479,431919,interesting right now that you
aje9UGNi_l0,431919,433759,understand this it might make sense then
aje9UGNi_l0,433759,435360,when you hear that like caffeine could
aje9UGNi_l0,435360,437840,just have such a lasting effect even
aje9UGNi_l0,437840,438880,though it's something that we might have
aje9UGNi_l0,438880,441280,consumed many many hours before bed so
aje9UGNi_l0,441280,442720,maybe what just is helpful to keep in
aje9UGNi_l0,442720,444960,mind is caffeine's half-life and to try
aje9UGNi_l0,444960,446639,to have our caffeine early in the
aje9UGNi_l0,446639,448720,morning or early in the afternoon and
aje9UGNi_l0,448720,450080,try to limit it later on in the evening
aje9UGNi_l0,450080,453680,if we want to have a better night's rest
aje9UGNi_l0,454880,458000,water makes up about 55 to 75 percent of
aje9UGNi_l0,458000,459599,our body weight and it's involved in so
aje9UGNi_l0,459599,461120,many different reactions in the human
aje9UGNi_l0,461120,462880,body but a lot of adults just don't
aje9UGNi_l0,462880,465280,drink enough and even mild dehydration
aje9UGNi_l0,465280,466960,according to the research can cause
aje9UGNi_l0,466960,468560,things like fatigue and daytime
aje9UGNi_l0,468560,471280,sleepiness mood changes and a drop in
aje9UGNi_l0,471280,473199,cognitive performance so if you find
aje9UGNi_l0,473199,474720,that you're tired a lot during the day
aje9UGNi_l0,474720,476319,it might help to just check in and see
aje9UGNi_l0,476319,477680,if you think you've been drinking enough
aje9UGNi_l0,477680,479199,some tell-tale signs or your skin or
aje9UGNi_l0,479199,481039,lips might be dry or your pee could be a
aje9UGNi_l0,481039,483039,bit dark in color and if it is it's just
aje9UGNi_l0,483039,485199,a reminder to drink a little bit more i
aje9UGNi_l0,485199,487599,myself am terrible at remembering to
aje9UGNi_l0,487599,489280,drink enough water so it helps to just
aje9UGNi_l0,489280,491360,kind of have a cup by your desk as a
aje9UGNi_l0,491360,492879,reminder to drink sometimes or you could

aje9UGNi_l0,505919,508400,as often as possible not only to support
aje9UGNi_l0,508400,510960,overall health but also to help us feel
aje9UGNi_l0,510960,513039,more energized throughout the day and to
aje9UGNi_l0,513039,514719,help better support our sleep but there
