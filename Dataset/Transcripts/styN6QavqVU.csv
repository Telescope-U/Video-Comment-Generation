styN6QavqVU,118240,120079,relevant times except that's the show
styN6QavqVU,120079,123439,that ended up five years ago
styN6QavqVU,123439,126840,i'm just getting caught up with it okay
styN6QavqVU,126840,129039,stephanie it takes me some time to watch
styN6QavqVU,129039,130879,start making some amphibia references
styN6QavqVU,130879,132720,and then we'll be talking i'm on episode
styN6QavqVU,132720,134720,three thank you very much that also just
styN6QavqVU,134720,135520,ended
styN6QavqVU,135520,138480,so anyway we're here today to make some
styN6QavqVU,138480,141200,mashed potatoes yes why are we talking
styN6QavqVU,141200,142400,about thanksgiving and mashed potatoes
styN6QavqVU,142400,144080,when it's nowhere close to any of that
styN6QavqVU,144080,146920,well recently over on tick tock a
styN6QavqVU,146920,149200,monstrosity of a food hack has started
styN6QavqVU,149200,151920,to appear in which they take pringles
styN6QavqVU,151920,154800,and turn them into mashed potatoes on
styN6QavqVU,154800,156560,the surface that seems like an insane
styN6QavqVU,156560,158400,concept but when you dig down deeper it
styN6QavqVU,158400,160720,makes some level of sense pringles are
styN6QavqVU,160720,163040,chips made of dehydrated potato flakes
styN6QavqVU,163040,165280,that have been pressed and formed back
styN6QavqVU,165280,168000,into a chip kind of like this sort of
styN6QavqVU,168000,169200,stuff that you're getting out of the bag
styN6QavqVU,169200,171680,yep in fact they have the same first
styN6QavqVU,171680,174319,ingredient in both cases so our our
styN6QavqVU,174319,176400,little potato flakeys first ingredient
styN6QavqVU,176400,178560,is dried potatoes and then also if you
styN6QavqVU,178560,180800,look at pringles first ingredient dried
styN6QavqVU,180800,182879,potatoes that's kind of the question
styN6QavqVU,182879,184879,here is this actually viable the way
styN6QavqVU,184879,186800,they show it on the tick tock is there a
styN6QavqVU,186800,189280,better way of doing it and then
styN6QavqVU,189280,190950,once we've proven all of that
styN6QavqVU,190950,192560,[Music]
styN6QavqVU,192560,194720,can we do it with other chips so today
styN6QavqVU,194720,196159,we're going to determine whether or not
styN6QavqVU,196159,198560,pringles new motto should be once you
styN6QavqVU,198560,202239,pop the mashed potatoes don't stop
styN6QavqVU,202239,205840,yikes that's pretty bad was it
styN6QavqVU,205840,207760,well not as bad as the mashed potatoes
styN6QavqVU,207760,209280,are going to turn out tell you what hey
styN6QavqVU,209280,210640,y'all
styN6QavqVU,210640,212799,up top tick tock food hacks are garbage

styN6QavqVU,215200,216879,indeed they are but before we
styN6QavqVU,216879,218640,transitioned over to experiment mode in
styN6QavqVU,218640,220159,order to start wrecking our stomachs
styN6QavqVU,220159,222239,steph and i first had to settle one
styN6QavqVU,222239,226000,important debate mashed potatoes
styN6QavqVU,226000,227519,potatoes isn't that isn't that a dance

styN6QavqVU,239840,241680,of a knees out and he's in kind of a
styN6QavqVU,241680,243360,like a like a smooshing by the patient
styN6QavqVU,243360,244879,you can't see any of this
styN6QavqVU,244879,247360,we're just behind a counter wiggling

styN6QavqVU,316400,318400,stuff fair game that might seem like a
styN6QavqVU,318400,320400,random request but here's why true story
styN6QavqVU,320400,321680,i was actually at disneyland in
styN6QavqVU,321680,323120,california with the team a few months
styN6QavqVU,323120,324639,ago and saw someone wearing one of our
styN6QavqVU,324639,326320,jackets totally ran up to her
styN6QavqVU,326320,328000,complimented her on her excellent taste
styN6QavqVU,328000,329919,in fashion and then i just ran away
styN6QavqVU,329919,331600,can't tell you if she was confused or
styN6QavqVU,331600,333600,excited by what just happened but it was
styN6QavqVU,333600,335520,indeed a thing and if i spot you in the
styN6QavqVU,335520,337919,wild i will approach you awkwardly so
styN6QavqVU,337919,339600,join the ranks of the theorist core
styN6QavqVU,339600,341759,today check it out at theoryware.com or
styN6QavqVU,341759,343520,just click the merch shelf right below
styN6QavqVU,343520,345520,this video now enough stalling it was
styN6QavqVU,345520,347120,time to see whether this tick tock food
styN6QavqVU,347120,349759,hack was a spud or a dud since i wanted
styN6QavqVU,349759,351440,this to be a proper experiment we needed
styN6QavqVU,351440,353280,a control group so we whipped up some
styN6QavqVU,353280,354800,regular mashed potatoes to see what our
styN6QavqVU,354800,357199,pringle goo should taste like side note
styN6QavqVU,357199,358639,while doing research for the episode i
styN6QavqVU,358639,360160,came across a bunch of random sites that
styN6QavqVU,360160,361520,were claiming that instant mashed
styN6QavqVU,361520,363520,potatoes are banned within the european
styN6QavqVU,363520,365759,union which seemed like a wild food myth
styN6QavqVU,365759,367919,that's just demonstrably false there are
styN6QavqVU,367919,369759,french brands of instant mashed potatoes
styN6QavqVU,369759,371440,along with french television commercials
styN6QavqVU,371440,373680,advertising them confused i started to
styN6QavqVU,373680,374960,dig deeper and i was shocked to learn
styN6QavqVU,374960,376479,that many brands of american instant
styN6QavqVU,376479,378800,mashed potatoes are indeed banned over
styN6QavqVU,378800,380639,in europe largely because they use a
styN6QavqVU,380639,383000,specific preservative named butylated
styN6QavqVU,383000,386240,hydroxyanisole or bha it's used in a lot
styN6QavqVU,386240,387520,of packaged foods to help them keep
styN6QavqVU,387520,389280,fresh which is good but it also tends to
styN6QavqVU,389280,391360,cause cancer and lab tested rats which
styN6QavqVU,391360,393520,is less good obviously scientists
styN6QavqVU,393520,395280,haven't proven definitively that it's a
styN6QavqVU,395280,397520,human carcinogen but many anticipate
styN6QavqVU,397520,399280,that it's probably not all that good for
styN6QavqVU,399280,400960,us so hey even if the mashed potato
styN6QavqVU,400960,402560,pringles don't taste as good as my
styN6QavqVU,402560,403840,favorite flakes at least they don't
styN6QavqVU,403840,406000,cause cancer yay
styN6QavqVU,406000,407759,anyway with a basic mash out of the way
styN6QavqVU,407759,409520,it was time to move on to the tick tock
styN6QavqVU,409520,411680,recipe originally created by dirk boy
styN6QavqVU,411680,414319,2.0 the steps were pretty easy to follow
styN6QavqVU,414319,416479,you take a can of pringles pop it open
styN6QavqVU,416479,419599,and literally dump it in
styN6QavqVU,420240,422800,and that's it
styN6QavqVU,422800,424800,now that is a recipe that i can get
styN6QavqVU,424800,427520,behind no mashing no stirring no nothing
styN6QavqVU,427520,429440,they just kind of dissolve into a puddly
styN6QavqVU,429440,430960,mess with the texture of grits or
styN6QavqVU,430960,433039,oatmeal don't you dare put this in the
styN6QavqVU,433039,435680,same category as grits porridge
styN6QavqVU,435680,437199,is amazing
styN6QavqVU,437199,439360,porridge perhaps i like all those things
styN6QavqVU,439360,443440,stop that stop i like hot cereal i'm 75
styN6QavqVU,443440,445280,on the inside well guess what you're
styN6QavqVU,445280,447280,gonna like this too so now what are we
styN6QavqVU,447280,448800,always telling ollie about trying your
styN6QavqVU,448800,452000,food stuff you gotta try new foods cause
styN6QavqVU,452000,454479,they might taste good thanks daniel
styN6QavqVU,454479,457039,tiger you gotta try pringles soaked in
styN6QavqVU,457039,459120,boiling water and rehydrated in order to
styN6QavqVU,459120,460479,make mashed potatoes because it might
styN6QavqVU,460479,463800,taste good
styN6QavqVU,464000,465759,go in with an open mind my friends but
styN6QavqVU,465759,467199,despite my best efforts i was about to
styN6QavqVU,467199,469039,learn that there's only so far a
styN6QavqVU,469039,471039,positive mental attitude can take you we
styN6QavqVU,471039,473599,now strain
styN6QavqVU,473599,474400,oh
styN6QavqVU,474400,476400,no
styN6QavqVU,476400,479360,oh no it looks bad
styN6QavqVU,479360,481120,it looks like baby puke do you suffer
styN6QavqVU,481120,484000,from mers mid-episode regret syndrome i
styN6QavqVU,484000,485840,do on a very frequent basis on this
styN6QavqVU,485840,487440,channel i like that it's simultaneously
styN6QavqVU,487440,489039,drained out a lot of the potatoes into
styN6QavqVU,489039,490800,the sink and yet there's still a huge
styN6QavqVU,490800,493680,pool of water on top
styN6QavqVU,493680,496400,this is just so many fails all combined
styN6QavqVU,496400,498160,ah this is the first episode to make me
styN6QavqVU,498160,500160,bag oh no oh no
styN6QavqVU,500160,502000,don't look directly at it really like
styN6QavqVU,502000,504720,avoid eye contact if you can eye contact
styN6QavqVU,504720,506560,wasn't the only thing we had to worry
styN6QavqVU,506560,508960,about ooh the smell i can withstand a
styN6QavqVU,508960,510160,lot of things
styN6QavqVU,510160,511840,friends i can withstand a lot of things
styN6QavqVU,511840,515440,the smell of this concoction
styN6QavqVU,515440,518240,it's pretty raw it's the consistency of
styN6QavqVU,518240,521680,applesauce has the smell of rancid flesh
styN6QavqVU,521680,523518,as you can imagine if it looked and
styN6QavqVU,523518,525760,smelled as good as this we were really
styN6QavqVU,525760,527519,excited about the prospect of putting it
styN6QavqVU,527519,530240,in our mouths oh boy i hope you're
styN6QavqVU,530240,532399,hungry because
styN6QavqVU,532399,534880,we've got some potatoes for you it
styN6QavqVU,534880,537760,jiggles like pudding or jello
styN6QavqVU,537760,539920,it is not it's not what
styN6QavqVU,539920,541200,mashed potatoes should do you're not
styN6QavqVU,541200,543360,implying that tick tock would give me a
styN6QavqVU,543360,545600,bad recipe for food are you i mean tick
styN6QavqVU,545600,547200,tock is pretty much the end-all be-all
styN6QavqVU,547200,549279,of factual information the texture can
styN6QavqVU,549279,551279,always be adjusted watching this glop
styN6QavqVU,551279,553200,down is just the worst we hadn't even
styN6QavqVU,553200,554959,tasted the pringles mushroom we already
styN6QavqVU,554959,556560,wanted a palette cleanser but there was
styN6QavqVU,556560,558399,no preventing the inevitable we had to
styN6QavqVU,558399,562440,take a bite for science
styN6QavqVU,568959,571600,i just want to cry
styN6QavqVU,571600,573440,i just want to cry it's the texture of
styN6QavqVU,573440,576440,snot
styN6QavqVU,576480,577760,it's like
styN6QavqVU,577760,579839,i haven't had snot in my mouth like that
styN6QavqVU,579839,583040,many times in my life
styN6QavqVU,583040,586000,but i recognize the texture
styN6QavqVU,586000,589040,very distinctly
styN6QavqVU,590399,592560,it's like wallpaper paste it is it's
styN6QavqVU,592560,595040,gluey it's very
styN6QavqVU,595040,598480,what is in a pringle that is so adhesive
styN6QavqVU,598480,599920,glad you asked steph well we didn't
styN6QavqVU,599920,601760,realize that at the time now that i've
styN6QavqVU,601760,603360,gone back and done some research i can
styN6QavqVU,603360,605360,actually explain unlike potato chips
styN6QavqVU,605360,607040,which are literally just sliced and
styN6QavqVU,607040,610160,fried potatoes pringles are less than 50
styN6QavqVU,610160,613680,potato in fact they're only 42 potato if
styN6QavqVU,613680,615200,you watch videos on how pringles are
styN6QavqVU,615200,616959,made or you just check the ingredients
styN6QavqVU,616959,618880,list you'll see that dried potatoes are
styN6QavqVU,618880,620560,ground into powder and then combined
styN6QavqVU,620560,622720,with oil water and a secret mixture of
styN6QavqVU,622720,625200,starches to create a paste that paste is
styN6QavqVU,625200,626959,then flattened out like a big old sheet
styN6QavqVU,626959,628399,kind of like a large flat layer of
styN6QavqVU,628399,630000,lasagna or cookie dough where the
styN6QavqVU,630000,632160,oval-shaped chips then get cut out but
styN6QavqVU,632160,634320,it's the starches specifically the
styN6QavqVU,634320,636720,cornstarch that's producing the gloppy
styN6QavqVU,636720,638959,snot-like texture that we're reacting to
styN6QavqVU,638959,640640,here cornstarch is used for its
styN6QavqVU,640640,642000,thickening properties in foods like
styN6QavqVU,642000,643760,gravies soups and marinades but when
styN6QavqVU,643760,645920,mixed with water the resulting gel can
styN6QavqVU,645920,648240,be used for like a basic glue and when
styN6QavqVU,648240,650079,you remember that over 50 percent of the
styN6QavqVU,650079,653040,chip isn't potato that's likely a lot of
styN6QavqVU,653040,655600,starch in that mix resulting in a lot of
styN6QavqVU,655600,657600,sticky glue for science i'm gonna go
styN6QavqVU,657600,659360,back in for one more
styN6QavqVU,659360,661040,just so i can analyze something other
styN6QavqVU,661040,662399,than the texture
styN6QavqVU,662399,664640,but let me tell ya taking a bite of this
styN6QavqVU,664640,666240,all you can really focus on is the
styN6QavqVU,666240,668959,texture because it sucks mildly pringly
styN6QavqVU,668959,670720,but not as good as a pringle
styN6QavqVU,670720,673040,yeah it's like wet slightly salty
styN6QavqVU,673040,674640,cardboard
styN6QavqVU,674640,676240,is the flavor that i'm going with right
styN6QavqVU,676240,678240,now it's getting worse actually after i
styN6QavqVU,678240,680480,eat it oh it lingers in your mouth for
styN6QavqVU,680480,681360,sure
styN6QavqVU,681360,683440,just lingers i i want yeah i can
styN6QavqVU,683440,684800,give me a hit of this
styN6QavqVU,684800,686959,tons of palate smells so much better
styN6QavqVU,686959,689839,okay
styN6QavqVU,692959,694959,so obviously not a success it didn't
styN6QavqVU,694959,697200,taste terrible i mean it was just gloppy
styN6QavqVU,697200,698800,pringles after all but it was the
styN6QavqVU,698800,701279,texture that really was unbearable it's
styN6QavqVU,701279,703440,a pretty inedible texture it's actual
styN6QavqVU,703440,705120,glue like you could you could paste
styN6QavqVU,705120,707519,things together with this but in theory
styN6QavqVU,707519,710240,in food theory we were convinced that
styN6QavqVU,710240,711839,this should work pringles are made of
styN6QavqVU,711839,713839,potato just like instant mashed potatoes
styN6QavqVU,713839,715760,are made from potato maybe it was just a
styN6QavqVU,715760,717440,matter of massaging the recipe a little
styN6QavqVU,717440,719040,so like a food network star trying
styN6QavqVU,719040,720720,desperately to get a second season we
styN6QavqVU,720720,722399,tried to make this recipe work for this
styN6QavqVU,722399,724000,part of our experiment we tried three
styN6QavqVU,724000,725600,different chip varieties the original
styN6QavqVU,725600,727760,pringles lay's potato chips and cheddar
styN6QavqVU,727760,729279,flavored pringles in the event that the
styN6QavqVU,729279,730959,added flavor would help we took the
styN6QavqVU,730959,732560,instant mashed potato recipe from the
styN6QavqVU,732560,734320,box and replaced these dried potato
styN6QavqVU,734320,736240,flakes with these dried potato chips
styN6QavqVU,736240,737680,which were then crushed into tiny little
styN6QavqVU,737680,739200,pieces by hand and now steph if you want
styN6QavqVU,739200,741519,to do some crushing oh i do get what i
styN6QavqVU,741519,743519,do get out some rage oh this is
styN6QavqVU,743519,744959,satisfying
styN6QavqVU,744959,746720,it's actually great this is our asmr
styN6QavqVU,746720,748639,channel right now
styN6QavqVU,748639,751200,i'm crushing up the pringles
styN6QavqVU,751200,754320,we're gonna make some mashed potatoes
styN6QavqVU,754320,759000,oh they're gonna be so yummy and good
styN6QavqVU,759360,762320,is your brain tickling right now
styN6QavqVU,762320,764639,because your mouth's about to tingle
styN6QavqVU,764639,766800,with the taste of these pringles
styN6QavqVU,766800,768399,we decided it was probably best to leave
styN6QavqVU,768399,770160,our asmr careers behind us and just
styN6QavqVU,770160,772720,stick with theories oh snap you are
styN6QavqVU,772720,775360,infuriating all right get it out oh
styN6QavqVU,775360,777600,i hate doing thumbnail meetings
styN6QavqVU,777600,778720,oh
styN6QavqVU,778720,780800,i'm so frustrated about all these things
styN6QavqVU,780800,782399,in my life why'd you look at me when you
styN6QavqVU,782399,785720,said that
styN6QavqVU,786639,789839,oh back room's lower
styN6QavqVU,789839,794000,ah poppy playtime
styN6QavqVU,794880,796160,i still haven't gotten the taste of that
styN6QavqVU,796160,798399,tree out of my mouth two years later oh
styN6QavqVU,798399,800240,wow you really you you got it down
styN6QavqVU,800240,803200,really fast you did great you that was
styN6QavqVU,803200,804959,some like serious aggression those chips
styN6QavqVU,804959,807360,are gone i've ground them into powder
styN6QavqVU,807360,810000,with the amount of stress and anxiety
styN6QavqVU,810000,811839,that i've got now it's time
styN6QavqVU,811839,813440,it's time to put the potatoes in
styN6QavqVU,813440,814800,after that crash course in anger
styN6QavqVU,814800,816480,management it was time to create our new
styN6QavqVU,816480,818320,chip-based mashed potatoes using the
styN6QavqVU,818320,820320,instant flakes recipe now coming up with
styN6QavqVU,820320,822079,a perfect one-to-one substitution was a
styN6QavqVU,822079,823519,bit hard to pull off since if we
styN6QavqVU,823519,825199,measured by volume we were gonna have
styN6QavqVU,825199,827120,inconsistencies based on how finally we
styN6QavqVU,827120,828320,crushed the chips and doing a
styN6QavqVU,828320,829839,substitution based on weight wouldn't
styN6QavqVU,829839,831120,work either because a lot of the weight
styN6QavqVU,831120,832399,of the potato chip is coming from the
styN6QavqVU,832399,834240,oil trapped inside of it so we did some
styN6QavqVU,834240,836160,basic guesstimation and adjusted as we
styN6QavqVU,836160,838000,went is it still snotty
styN6QavqVU,838000,839760,um
styN6QavqVU,839760,842240,it's not not snotty i can't believe it's
styN6QavqVU,842240,844480,snot butter then it was under the leaves
styN6QavqVU,844480,846560,these are looking rough
styN6QavqVU,846560,847600,i mean
styN6QavqVU,847600,851360,rough like ruffles
styN6QavqVU,851760,854839,ruffle it's a chip get it ruffles
styN6QavqVU,854839,857199,ruffles and finally the cheddar it's
styN6QavqVU,857199,859839,like sad glumpy mac and cheese long
styN6QavqVU,859839,861440,story short
styN6QavqVU,861440,862800,i'm not looking forward to this taste
styN6QavqVU,862800,863920,test but
styN6QavqVU,863920,865040,we're all done
styN6QavqVU,865040,866720,we're all mixed
styN6QavqVU,866720,868560,let's throw it in a bowl and shove it
styN6QavqVU,868560,870240,down our throats you might sense that i
styN6QavqVU,870240,872079,was feeling slightly defeated by this
styN6QavqVU,872079,874079,point of the episode little did i know
styN6QavqVU,874079,876079,our taste tests were gonna yield some
styN6QavqVU,876079,878240,very surprising results all right
styN6QavqVU,878240,882160,friends so our mashed potatoes are done
styN6QavqVU,882160,885040,it's not looking pretty we did our best
styN6QavqVU,885040,888399,we did everything we could i feel like
styN6QavqVU,888399,891519,this episode has been such a betrayal of
styN6QavqVU,891519,893120,my favorite food well you know what this
styN6QavqVU,893120,894800,has made me realize
styN6QavqVU,894800,898240,is that every single one of these bowls
styN6QavqVU,898240,900480,of mashed potatoes is significantly more
styN6QavqVU,900480,903279,expensive and requires more steps to
styN6QavqVU,903279,906160,make than actual flake potatoes that is
styN6QavqVU,906160,907760,actually very true
styN6QavqVU,907760,911920,economizing nothing here your time your
styN6QavqVU,911920,915199,money you even the ingredients like
styN6QavqVU,915199,916880,i feel like flake potatoes you can get
styN6QavqVU,916880,919920,at any grocery store but sometimes like
styN6QavqVU,919920,922399,potato chips the specific kind you want
styN6QavqVU,922399,925120,or pringles especially hard to find this
styN6QavqVU,925120,928160,expensive saves nothing no actually for
styN6QavqVU,928160,930560,this being branded as a mashed potato
styN6QavqVU,930560,933360,food life hack you are hacking nothing
styN6QavqVU,933360,935519,right life is hacking you but that
styN6QavqVU,935519,937040,general observation out of the way it
styN6QavqVU,937040,938959,was time to power through some potato
styN6QavqVU,938959,940639,you can already tell
styN6QavqVU,940639,942880,from a textural standpoint that they are
styN6QavqVU,942880,946240,much more similar let's try it
styN6QavqVU,951279,952839,they're so
styN6QavqVU,952839,955440,sad it's like if
styN6QavqVU,955440,957440,if the first round
styN6QavqVU,957440,959680,was like eating glue this is like eating
styN6QavqVU,959680,962399,glue if it like is half dried if you let
styN6QavqVU,962399,963600,it sit in your mouth for too long your
styN6QavqVU,963600,965360,mouth is going to like stay shut you
styN6QavqVU,965360,966639,know it'll never open again you know
styN6QavqVU,966639,967759,what i will say though the taste is
styN6QavqVU,967759,970720,better this has just made me realize
styN6QavqVU,970720,973040,how i don't i guess like the flavor of
styN6QavqVU,973040,974720,pringles
styN6QavqVU,974720,976399,i don't know i i thought i liked
styN6QavqVU,976399,977519,pringles
styN6QavqVU,977519,979519,but seeing the flavor of pringles
styN6QavqVU,979519,983279,distilled into this
styN6QavqVU,983279,986160,it just has this cardboardy flavor to it
styN6QavqVU,986160,987839,it's not actually that great obviously
styN6QavqVU,987839,990000,that doesn't work outside of chip form
styN6QavqVU,990000,992160,and i don't know why it doesn't work
styN6QavqVU,992160,994160,pause right there cause i do remember
styN6QavqVU,994160,995519,what we mentioned earlier pringles
styN6QavqVU,995519,997440,having less than 50 potato in them so
styN6QavqVU,997440,999120,here i'm just getting a lot more flavor
styN6QavqVU,999120,1001279,from the additives and oils it's a fiber
styN6QavqVU,1001279,1004000,and starchy flavor not an actual potato
styN6QavqVU,1004000,1005600,flavor traditional potato flakes by
styN6QavqVU,1005600,1007199,contrast don't have this issue because
styN6QavqVU,1007199,1009040,they've already been cooked that process
styN6QavqVU,1009040,1010560,is breaking down a lot of the natural
styN6QavqVU,1010560,1012079,starches that are in the potato and
styN6QavqVU,1012079,1014000,there isn't additional cornstarch or
styN6QavqVU,1014000,1015600,wheat starch that's been mixed in
styN6QavqVU,1015600,1017600,resulting in less gluey textures and
styN6QavqVU,1017600,1019600,less nasty flavors which is something
styN6QavqVU,1019600,1021360,that we were about to learn with test
styN6QavqVU,1021360,1023519,number two the lay's potato chips let's
styN6QavqVU,1023519,1025760,eat a lay's potato chip in mushy form
styN6QavqVU,1025760,1028079,shall we what's better than a potato
styN6QavqVU,1028079,1030558,chip a mushy potato chip you know what
styN6QavqVU,1030558,1034480,this tastes like potatoes or graton
styN6QavqVU,1034480,1037480,hmm
styN6QavqVU,1038319,1039199,this is
styN6QavqVU,1039199,1041038,decent kind of good
styN6QavqVU,1041038,1042400,oh
styN6QavqVU,1042400,1044000,we did it
styN6QavqVU,1044000,1045918,it's not terrible
styN6QavqVU,1045918,1048160,i don't want to throw up
styN6QavqVU,1048160,1050320,it's actually really good this is
styN6QavqVU,1050320,1053679,rotten potatoes legitimately
styN6QavqVU,1053679,1055520,this is one of those drier moments where
styN6QavqVU,1055520,1057840,i'm shocked this looks disgusting it
styN6QavqVU,1057840,1059919,looks terrible stirring it over there
styN6QavqVU,1059919,1061760,stephanie was like this is
styN6QavqVU,1061760,1063600,not gonna work this is absolutely worse
styN6QavqVU,1063600,1064960,than the pringles
styN6QavqVU,1064960,1066480,this is my fourth bite of this
styN6QavqVU,1066480,1069120,but the fact that maybe that's a mistake
styN6QavqVU,1069120,1070559,it's salty
styN6QavqVU,1070559,1072960,it's potato more importantly it's potato
styN6QavqVU,1072960,1074720,and i think that's what the pringles are
styN6QavqVU,1074720,1076960,missing is the potato flavor they taste
styN6QavqVU,1076960,1079679,like cardboard whereas this tastes like
styN6QavqVU,1079679,1081919,a potato see what i tell you shocking
styN6QavqVU,1081919,1083520,results but going back and looking at
styN6QavqVU,1083520,1084960,the science of how these chips are made
styN6QavqVU,1084960,1087360,it absolutely makes complete sense this
styN6QavqVU,1087360,1089360,is actually a success
styN6QavqVU,1089360,1092880,it's buttery it's salty it's potatoey
styN6QavqVU,1092880,1095039,this is actually lovely if you had no
styN6QavqVU,1095039,1097360,potatoes in your house and you for some
styN6QavqVU,1097360,1099840,reason needed a like actual hot served
styN6QavqVU,1099840,1101360,potato dish
styN6QavqVU,1101360,1103039,on your table and you had no other
styN6QavqVU,1103039,1106400,options this is completely passable wow
styN6QavqVU,1106400,1109039,it works hallelujah one of them works
styN6QavqVU,1109039,1110960,and finally round number three the
styN6QavqVU,1110960,1112720,cheddar cheese pringles would a bit of
styN6QavqVU,1112720,1114320,extra flavor powder help them fare
styN6QavqVU,1114320,1116500,better than the originals
styN6QavqVU,1116500,1119710,[Music]
styN6QavqVU,1120240,1121440,the foot
styN6QavqVU,1121440,1123840,huh
styN6QavqVU,1124080,1125679,the flavor's better
styN6QavqVU,1125679,1128080,sort of
styN6QavqVU,1128720,1131120,you know what it tastes like a cheeto

styN6QavqVU,1132460,1133840,[Music]
styN6QavqVU,1133840,1136000,i don't mind this i'm surprised that
styN6QavqVU,1136000,1137039,you're actually having as strong of a
styN6QavqVU,1137039,1139039,reaction as you do the texture is still
styN6QavqVU,1139039,1141520,terrible i i disagree the flavor here is

styN6QavqVU,1165679,1168480,was shockingly intense and also very
styN6QavqVU,1168480,1170080,surprising from a result standpoint i
styN6QavqVU,1170080,1171600,was hopeful that one of them would turn
styN6QavqVU,1171600,1174480,out i did not expect it to be any of
