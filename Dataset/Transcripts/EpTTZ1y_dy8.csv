EpTTZ1y_dy8,2000,4069,The pandemic changed how we work.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,4070,10490,"And while some companies are reverting to a pre-pandemic workweek, 81% of executives say they are adopting a"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,10490,12280,more flexible workplace.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,12290,15050,But getting employees to return to the office hasn't been easy.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,15830,19970,You can't insist anymore that employees come in for a five day week.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,20450,26420,Clive Wilkinson is one of the architects being called on by the tech sector and others to help build workplaces that
EpTTZ1y_dy8,26420,29420,accommodate the changes of a post-pandemic world.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,29450,34140,"They'll come in because they want to, not because they're told to or that they have to."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,34160,38360,They'll come in because they want the benefits that the workplace will give them.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,38390,43129,People are going in to the office for different reasons than they were pre-pandemic.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,43160,45989,There's always going to be a need for the office.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,46010,50930,"It just might not be for everyone all day long, the way it was pre-pandemic."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,51320,54230,Wilkinson is no stranger to thinking outside the box.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,54260,57649,He's designed and built offices for some of the biggest names in tech.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,57680,63410,We were lucky enough to win the job to do the Google headquarters back in 2004.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,63440,64869,The Googleplex.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,64870,69830,"Sergey Brin once walked into the meeting and said, I would like a forest in the middle of the building."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,70100,75860,"And just as Google and Silicon Valley influence common trends in the modern workplace, it is once again reinventing"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,75860,77450,the office for hybrid work.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,77660,81140,We're in a different model where employees are going to be much more purpose driven.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,81140,87440,And so we're unwinding that idea of a worker being attached to a very specific spot of real
EpTTZ1y_dy8,87440,88880,estate within the company.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,89210,92659,"Pre-Covid, there was a lot of emphasis on individual space."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,92660,97910,We're really pivoting that to make sure that we're building in more collaboration spaces.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,97910,102020,"With these changes, employees are having a bigger say in what their offices look like."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,102050,107060,We surveyed a lot of our employees about what they're looking for in the next collab office.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,107070,113180,"It's really important that we understood what our employees wanted most in the next office, and we built that into the"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,113180,113780,design.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,113900,119180,The employers of the world are really having to listen to what makes a great workplace.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,119210,122900,It has to fill the gaps that work from home can't fill.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,133980,137290,Remote work introduced more flexibility to people's lives.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,137310,143690,"Working from home saved an average of 40 minutes daily from commuting, and 77% of workers say they were more productive."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,143700,146860,But the need for in-person business has remained unchanged.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,146880,151290,There was a lot of benefit and a lot of goodness that came from working from home.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,151290,153120,"But there was a lot of things that were missing, too, right?"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,153480,155550,People missed their colleagues.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,155550,159210,We don't have that spark of innovation from meeting someone face-to-face.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,160260,166590,The tax and accounting software giant Intuit is one of Clive Wilkinson's clients and it is going all in on the hybrid
EpTTZ1y_dy8,166590,171870,"model. Employees come in between two to three days in person, but that amount is up to each team."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,171870,178069,"On days where you might be doing a lot of individual work or heads-down work, working from home may be the right answer."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,178070,184500,"But when teams need to come together to collaborate, build that relationship, to innovate and move faster, we"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,184500,186570,think those are what really will draw people back to the campuses.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,187590,190340,Wilkinson has designed two buildings for Intuit.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,190350,194730,One was completed in 2016 and the other is expected to be finished next year.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,195060,197209,Did the first building with them.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,197210,203220,"A lot of kind of great collaboration space, town hall space, really kind of a well-evolved working"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,203220,209430,environment. We were about to repeat that more or less in a new building when the pandemic
EpTTZ1y_dy8,209430,209909,hit.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,210000,215460,"With the second project under construction during the pandemic, Wilkinson and his firm redesigned the interior to"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,215460,217710,reflect into its new hybrid model.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,217740,220920,The initial plans for Intuit were very workstation centric.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,220920,225300,"Coming through the pandemic, there was an acknowledgment that people are going to be working differently."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,225300,231510,And so the architecture needs to change functionally to better suit the wide variety of new
EpTTZ1y_dy8,231510,234400,reasons why people are actually going into the office.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,234420,240720,"We needed to kind of selectively reconfigure that space and create environments like, there's a"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,240720,244230,"library, there's more collaborative hubs."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,249400,254769,"Clive, what we wanted to review with you today was the progress on the Intuit blended neighborhoods."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,254770,261250,"So, if you recall, previously we had all workstations throughout the entire open office space and what we have"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,261250,265530,moved forward towards is indicating certain locations for open collab.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,265540,267910,We're in a time period where buildings have to be super flexible.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,268760,271480,They have to be able to expand and contract.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,271690,276970,"Through redesign of this building, this was actually an open office environment, so it looked just like this, but it was"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,276970,282250,really siloed. And so we thought that this really lended itself to a quiet life or a program.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,282250,288640,"But Intuit is asking that we really future-proof this space and consider what this could be day two, if"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,288640,293950,"they need to max out the building, remove that library, and then bring back those workstations."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,294250,300310,"I like how these different pieces can act as testing grounds, little beta testing"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,300310,306460,"pieces, and then they can see how that works over a period of time and adjust the rest of the building."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,307000,309970,Intuit'd new office layouts revolve around regions it calls neighborhoods.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,310960,317080,"The neighborhood concept is one where you take an entire floor plate, which can serve hundreds of people, but then"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,317080,319599,it's broken down into smaller compartments.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,319630,326020,"Putting teams together, but with a variety of space types, some seated, some conference rooms, some bookable,"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,326020,332440,"some non-bookable, but all in service to the way the groups are going to need to work, especially in a"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,332440,334080,hybrid world where not everybody may be there.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,334090,337870,Just come in and check in to the desk.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,338050,340330,It's surrounded by other support spaces.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,340330,346569,"So there's some two team rooms down at the end, as well as different drop-in rooms along the side."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,346570,348280,And those are really for focus work.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,348280,351220,So this is an example of what we're calling our library.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,351220,357580,"The concept was really to ensure that our employees had choices, particularly the engineers who"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,357580,360939,needed some additional spaces to do the heads-down and focus work.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,361120,366520,"This is an area that we've actually already set up, and one of the things we know that we needed to incorporate is"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,366520,367240,lockers.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,367660,372400,"Video conferencing tech is everywhere, helping bring remote and in-person workers together."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,372400,375250,I am talking to you today from our Mountain View campus.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,375280,381730,Mountain View is our headquarters and we have upwards of 1000 videoconferencing spaces on campus.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,381730,383890,You can Zoom. It has a couple of presets.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,384340,388720,The upgraded rooms that we're working on have what we call auto framing.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,388720,395020,And we heard really loud from our employees that their their concern is they want to be seen and be able to be
EpTTZ1y_dy8,395020,398590,"seen in the room, whether they're joining virtually or in the room."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,399550,405520,This is an example of one of the experiments that we're doing in collaboration spaces to really look at when people
EpTTZ1y_dy8,405520,408099,are coming back and they're not constantly looking at their laptop.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,408790,415090,The visuals and the content that might be shared in a Zoom call is close enough so that you can see
EpTTZ1y_dy8,415090,415449,it.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,416020,420940,"Another one of Wilkinson's clients is Collab, which is a social media creator tech company."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,421150,427479,Even though about half of our team is in LA and we're expecting them to come in to the new space 1 to 3 times a
EpTTZ1y_dy8,427480,430900,"week, but the majority of the team is going to continue to work remotely."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,430900,436720,So it's really important that the new space that we design really works well for both
EpTTZ1y_dy8,436990,439840,in-office team members and remote team members.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,439840,445510,It has also taken learnings from hybrid work to influence the design of its new headquarters in Los Angeles.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,445930,451479,"Having employees come back to the office, we're competing with the comforts of home, so we have to make the space"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,451480,454930,really inviting and comfortable and fun to visit.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,454930,461050,"And thinking about an office for them, it really was all about visitors and the opportunities of having"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,461050,466659,multiple settings for photo ops and shooting video and things like that.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,466660,472990,We have a whole number of different collaboration settings and it's mostly around collaboration and a little bit
EpTTZ1y_dy8,473530,479530,proportionally about actual focus work by their staff or their visitors.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,479530,483940,"These days, of course, Zoom and video conferencing is a huge thing."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,483940,489760,"So you'll see multiple dotted around the place, little smaller Zoom rooms, but also more"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,489910,494230,"collaborative, larger ones so that bigger groups can actually connect digitally."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,494260,500500,"Most of the furniture is reconfigurable and all you've really got are these kind of sets, and they do"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,500500,504880,feel a little theatrical and they are intended as being a little theatrical.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,504880,510130,And I do think also over time they're going to be able to change and evolve those sets.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,510130,512530,There is no workstations necessarily.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,512530,514539,It's really open collab space.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,514539,516339,There's some enclosed meeting rooms.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,516340,522700,"And the idea is that it is truly just a co-working space where creators can come in, but also employees, and they can"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,522700,523780,work together.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,523780,529030,It was about creating a space that the creators and the employees wanted to come to every day.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,530910,536819,"To see the workplace having to transform, if you really just think of the big picture, it's super exciting."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,536850,540069,"Like, we don't know what it's going to be like in five years time."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,540090,542340,I personally find that incredibly exciting.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,543720,546519,This is really a very simple equation.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,546540,552000,Make spaces that people want to be in and work in and collaborate in.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,552030,558180,We're starting to gain a deeper understanding of what people are looking for in their workplaces and
EpTTZ1y_dy8,558180,564060,what are the things that are missing about working from home that the office can fill in the gaps for.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,564360,568490,And companies aren't just rethinking how to organize their physical offices.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,568500,574710,We are definitely in discussion with clients about having a physical community and a digital community
EpTTZ1y_dy8,574710,578010,and devoting equal energy to the digital community.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,578280,584340,The hope is that all of these changes should empower workers and help make the office a better resource for productivity.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,584610,589680,"We've found that our employees are just as productive, if not more, working from home."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,589800,595830,"I think the future is this hybrid experience, both in  person and work from home."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,596010,597750,There's just so many benefits to it.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,597750,601170,People have more diversity and choice in where they work.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,601170,605910,But we're missing some things about working in the office the way we were pre-pandemic.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,605910,610430,"And as we move forward and design for the future, let's not lose either of those."
EpTTZ1y_dy8,610440,615210,Let's take the best of both of those worlds and bring them together into the future.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,615240,621480,"We certainly were working on the last model of a creative workplace, and I think it's going to go to the"
EpTTZ1y_dy8,621480,626220,next step. And the next step mostly is going to be about empowering employees.
EpTTZ1y_dy8,626490,629220,It's going to be making people's lives so much better.
