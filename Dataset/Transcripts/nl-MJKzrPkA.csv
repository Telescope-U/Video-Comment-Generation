nl-MJKzrPkA,134280,135950,"On a rainy day, we did a radio show"
nl-MJKzrPkA,136026,137451,This a few years ago now
nl-MJKzrPkA,137997,139424,After a radio show...
nl-MJKzrPkA,139537,141148,"It was a porch, I think"

nl-MJKzrPkA,218560,219905,really passionate
nl-MJKzrPkA,219919,221182,- at the time - Right
nl-MJKzrPkA,221183,222024,We did get wet in the rain
nl-MJKzrPkA,222025,224495,"Also, for DREAM concert in 2018,"

nl-MJKzrPkA,252919,254526,"Then, what did you do?"
nl-MJKzrPkA,254527,256496,- In the rain - We filmed something
nl-MJKzrPkA,258097,260278,But I'm curious about something

nl-MJKzrPkA,266963,267970,- Yes - It's annoying
nl-MJKzrPkA,267971,269528,"I bring it with me,  but I lose it all the time"
nl-MJKzrPkA,270423,272571,"Right, so I don't bring it, either"
nl-MJKzrPkA,272773,274501,"Our carnival, our umbrella"
nl-MJKzrPkA,275370,276070,That sounded like lyrics
nl-MJKzrPkA,276072,276952,CHENLE's mindset
nl-MJKzrPkA,276953,277641,That could be lyrics
nl-MJKzrPkA,278465,279359,You're cool
nl-MJKzrPkA,279360,280732,I want to be that too
nl-MJKzrPkA,280734,281489,your umbrella...
nl-MJKzrPkA,281490,283061,"Anyways, that's that"
nl-MJKzrPkA,283201,285087,"Now,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,285089,287498,JAEHYUN also participated in writing the lyrics
nl-MJKzrPkA,288674,290653,Was there any fun story behind it?
nl-MJKzrPkA,290654,292074,Could you may be tell us  what you had in mind
nl-MJKzrPkA,292287,293350,when you wrote it?
nl-MJKzrPkA,293352,295255,"Actually, this song"
nl-MJKzrPkA,295256,296887,Just...
nl-MJKzrPkA,296888,298270,"Coincidentally,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,298271,300867,"whenever we do a team song, I get assigned the rap part"
nl-MJKzrPkA,301531,303613,So I did the rap part
nl-MJKzrPkA,303704,305875,With what I first wrote
nl-MJKzrPkA,305876,307701,"and the existing lyrics,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,307702,309677,we decided to give it
nl-MJKzrPkA,309678,310674,a better
nl-MJKzrPkA,310718,311977,nuance to it
nl-MJKzrPkA,312039,313177,"So, just for my part"
nl-MJKzrPkA,313354,314869,we decided on that...
nl-MJKzrPkA,315128,316585,"So, I became a participant for it"

nl-MJKzrPkA,357513,359210,Tell us how you participate
nl-MJKzrPkA,359211,361626,"Also, tell us what goes in your mind when you write the songs"
nl-MJKzrPkA,361627,363664,"For me,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,363751,365054,"- when I take a shower, - Okay"
nl-MJKzrPkA,365057,367622,I come up with melodies a lot
nl-MJKzrPkA,368345,368911,When you wash up
nl-MJKzrPkA,369011,371749,I get a lot of inspirations  in the shower too
nl-MJKzrPkA,372319,374075,"So when you take a shower,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,374446,375754,"your mood depends  on how you felt that day, right?"
nl-MJKzrPkA,375755,376434,Right
nl-MJKzrPkA,376435,379001,"So, that's when I first come up with an idea"
nl-MJKzrPkA,379112,380363,Is that why during the concert
nl-MJKzrPkA,380364,381813,you came out of the shower?
nl-MJKzrPkA,381814,382766,- you came out of the shower? - Yes
nl-MJKzrPkA,382767,383791,They're all related
nl-MJKzrPkA,383792,385916,- They were all related - That was what it was
nl-MJKzrPkA,385917,387965,"- I get it now, there it is - I get it"
nl-MJKzrPkA,387966,390902,I'm a bit different from what
nl-MJKzrPkA,390903,392383,others do
nl-MJKzrPkA,392650,393418,I first
nl-MJKzrPkA,393500,394708,make the track
nl-MJKzrPkA,395295,397799,I make the track first
nl-MJKzrPkA,398148,399805,"Also, it depends on my mood"
nl-MJKzrPkA,399806,402102,Let's say it was raining
nl-MJKzrPkA,402103,403751,"Or if I were feeling really happy,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,403753,405436,or I thought of a story
nl-MJKzrPkA,405744,407432,"after watching a movie,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,407484,410438,I think of the foundation for a song first
nl-MJKzrPkA,410442,412318,"After I do that,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,412665,414501,I put the melody
nl-MJKzrPkA,414502,416238,and add the lyrics at the end
nl-MJKzrPkA,416239,417253,That's my routine
nl-MJKzrPkA,417254,417931,That's so cool
nl-MJKzrPkA,417932,420329,Each of us has a unique routine
nl-MJKzrPkA,420330,421061,- Yes - Right
nl-MJKzrPkA,421063,423608,"XIAOJUN, CHENLE, and KUN,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,423610,425366,"when you guys sing,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,425367,427320,I see that you guys
nl-MJKzrPkA,427321,429637,change your voices a bit
nl-MJKzrPkA,429638,431411,Is there a special method for that?
nl-MJKzrPkA,431858,432723,I'm curious
nl-MJKzrPkA,432724,433861,CHENLE's voice with thousand colors
nl-MJKzrPkA,433862,434998,CHENLE's voice with thousand colors
nl-MJKzrPkA,435089,436236,"I don't really,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,436737,438098,you know...
nl-MJKzrPkA,438259,441348,"You feel a certain emotion when you hear a song, right?"
nl-MJKzrPkA,441349,444226,"So, I try to change my voice"
nl-MJKzrPkA,444227,446918,in a way that I believe
nl-MJKzrPkA,447054,448919,would suit the mood of the song
nl-MJKzrPkA,449033,449854,the best
nl-MJKzrPkA,450497,452120,"For ""Dancing in the rain,"""
nl-MJKzrPkA,453808,455500,I think it's the best
nl-MJKzrPkA,455660,456887,to make it sound refreshing
nl-MJKzrPkA,457184,458514,- Refreshing - Yes
nl-MJKzrPkA,458701,459525,I think
nl-MJKzrPkA,459917,461483,"""Dancing in the rain"" feels like"
nl-MJKzrPkA,463444,466787,"a song you'd listen to  when you're in a good mood, right?"
nl-MJKzrPkA,466788,468628,It has an exciting vibe
nl-MJKzrPkA,468629,470862,"Even when I recorded it,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,470863,472379,"when I sang with a smile on my face,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,472819,474372,I could project a cheerful tone
nl-MJKzrPkA,474385,476563,It's definitely different
nl-MJKzrPkA,476564,478125,- if you smile - It sure is
nl-MJKzrPkA,478126,479298,It's different
nl-MJKzrPkA,479299,481317,You just mentioned you smiled
nl-MJKzrPkA,481318,483988,as you sang this song
nl-MJKzrPkA,483989,486702,"Then, when you hear your recording,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,486918,488762,was there any part that you liked
nl-MJKzrPkA,489322,490953,more than others?
nl-MJKzrPkA,490955,492478,"Well, the chorus part"
nl-MJKzrPkA,492480,494077,- I really liked it - Right
nl-MJKzrPkA,494078,496334,"Other than the chorus part,  as I mentioned before,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,496335,497495,I liked JAEHYUN's intro
nl-MJKzrPkA,497982,499694,I think it sets
nl-MJKzrPkA,500879,502500,the mood of the song very well
nl-MJKzrPkA,502817,503692,So I like it

nl-MJKzrPkA,798714,800438,He and I roomed together
nl-MJKzrPkA,800764,801806,"and in the room,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,802760,804921,he has a tendency to listen to just  one album when he likes it
nl-MJKzrPkA,804922,805271,Right
nl-MJKzrPkA,805272,806703,"So during that time,"

nl-MJKzrPkA,820232,821471,"Then, guys,"
nl-MJKzrPkA,821660,823638,if we were to sing together again
nl-MJKzrPkA,823723,825138,"with this same group of members,"

nl-MJKzrPkA,872048,873027,I'd like to try something with an orchestra
nl-MJKzrPkA,873676,874809,Instead of singing?
nl-MJKzrPkA,874810,875818,We should still sing
nl-MJKzrPkA,875819,877092,We should sing
nl-MJKzrPkA,877095,877542,and something grandiose
