rhgwIhB58PA,0,1987,- This video is about learning styles.
rhgwIhB58PA,1987,3950,What kind of learner are you?
rhgwIhB58PA,3950,5060,"- Oh yeah, I'm a visual person"
rhgwIhB58PA,5060,5893,"so I have to see things, yeah. - Oh yeah, same."
rhgwIhB58PA,5893,7630,- I think visual learner.
rhgwIhB58PA,7630,8463,- Visual.
rhgwIhB58PA,8463,11040,"- I mean, like, I remember formulas like auditory."
rhgwIhB58PA,11040,13260,"- I need to be like, interacting with the material."
rhgwIhB58PA,13260,15010,- I like to learn by doing it myself.
rhgwIhB58PA,15010,15843,- Very hands-on.
rhgwIhB58PA,15843,16820,- Hands-on learner.
rhgwIhB58PA,16820,17653,- Hands-on?
rhgwIhB58PA,17653,19480,"- So like, if I have a model, I'd like to look at that"
rhgwIhB58PA,19480,20430,and look it over.
rhgwIhB58PA,20430,23030,- Part of this video was sponsored by Google Search.
rhgwIhB58PA,25040,27510,There is this idea in education that everyone
rhgwIhB58PA,27510,29210,"has their own preferred way of learning,"
rhgwIhB58PA,29210,31160,their so-called learning style.
rhgwIhB58PA,31160,32840,If information is presented in accordance
rhgwIhB58PA,32840,36090,"with the learning style, well, then they'll learn better."
rhgwIhB58PA,36090,38950,"Now, there are dozens of different learning style theories,"
rhgwIhB58PA,38950,40660,but the most common one identifies
rhgwIhB58PA,40660,43790,"four main learning styles, visual, auditory,"
rhgwIhB58PA,43790,47132,"reading-writing, and kinesthetic or VARK for short."
rhgwIhB58PA,47132,49570,"Visual learners learn best from images,"
rhgwIhB58PA,49570,51560,"demonstrations, and pictures."
rhgwIhB58PA,51560,54110,"- People may say things, but I can't really take it in."
rhgwIhB58PA,54110,57830,I just gotta see 'em act it out or write it or something.
rhgwIhB58PA,57830,59230,- [Derek] Auditory learners learn best
rhgwIhB58PA,59230,61239,from listening to an explanation.
rhgwIhB58PA,61240,64410,"- Like in school, I was always engaged in the lecture"
rhgwIhB58PA,64410,67300,and that was usually good enough to pass a test.
rhgwIhB58PA,67300,68900,- [Derek] Reading-writing learners learn best
rhgwIhB58PA,68900,70100,from reading and writing.
rhgwIhB58PA,70100,71979,- Like I can get pretty much anything
rhgwIhB58PA,71980,73610,out of reading a textbook or something.
rhgwIhB58PA,73610,76010,- [Derek] And kinesthetic learners learn best by doing.
rhgwIhB58PA,76010,77740,Physically interacting with the world.
rhgwIhB58PA,77740,78573,- Hands-on.
rhgwIhB58PA,78573,80500,"You have to touch things, you have to play with things,"
rhgwIhB58PA,80500,83065,"you know, it's a contact sport."
rhgwIhB58PA,83065,84550,You have to do it yourself.
rhgwIhB58PA,84550,87530,"- I want to try something with you, a little experiment."
rhgwIhB58PA,87530,89067,I want to show you 10 pictures of things
rhgwIhB58PA,89067,90810,and I don't want you to say anything
rhgwIhB58PA,90810,92909,"while you're looking at them, and at the end of the 10"
rhgwIhB58PA,92910,94660,you tell me how many you can remember.
rhgwIhB58PA,94660,95493,- Okay.
rhgwIhB58PA,95493,96326,- Okay? - Okay.
rhgwIhB58PA,96326,97159,- Okay.
rhgwIhB58PA,98910,100900,"- Now, learning styles make intuitive sense"
rhgwIhB58PA,100900,103510,because we know everyone is different.
rhgwIhB58PA,103510,105960,Some people have better spacial reasoning.
rhgwIhB58PA,105960,108580,Others have better listening comprehension.
rhgwIhB58PA,108580,110210,We know some people are better readers
rhgwIhB58PA,110210,112540,while others are good with their hands.
rhgwIhB58PA,112540,116430,- It's sort of very much fits with a broad strain
rhgwIhB58PA,116430,120180,"of thought in the recent Western tradition is,"
rhgwIhB58PA,120180,121850,"we're all unique, we're all different."
rhgwIhB58PA,121850,122799,"And so you don't want to say, like,"
rhgwIhB58PA,122800,124157,everybody learns the same way.
rhgwIhB58PA,124157,127090,That sort of conflicts with our feelings
rhgwIhB58PA,127090,129190,about what it means to be human.
rhgwIhB58PA,129190,132190,- So doesn't it make sense that people should learn better
rhgwIhB58PA,132190,134390,in their own preferred learning style?
rhgwIhB58PA,134390,136720,"Well, teachers certainly seem to think so."
rhgwIhB58PA,136720,139410,A survey of nearly 400 teachers from the UK
rhgwIhB58PA,139410,142550,and the Netherlands found that over 90% believed
rhgwIhB58PA,142550,145510,that individuals learn better when they receive information
rhgwIhB58PA,145510,147340,in their preferred learning style.
rhgwIhB58PA,147340,148440,- [Instructor] Just like every professor
rhgwIhB58PA,148440,150000,"has a different style of teaching,"
rhgwIhB58PA,150000,151840,you have a different style of learning.
rhgwIhB58PA,151840,154000,"- [Instructor] But when his teacher starts using visuals,"
rhgwIhB58PA,154000,155620,Johnathan finds it easier to focus
rhgwIhB58PA,155620,156909,and understand the material
rhgwIhB58PA,156910,159382,so he might be a visual learner.
rhgwIhB58PA,159382,161610,- [Derek] Can you tell me what that means to you?
rhgwIhB58PA,161610,163360,"Like, what does it mean to be a visual learner?"
rhgwIhB58PA,163360,165620,- To me it means that for me to learn something
rhgwIhB58PA,165620,168250,sometimes you need to draw it or I need to write it down
rhgwIhB58PA,168250,171080,or I need to see a picture or a movie.
rhgwIhB58PA,171080,174200,"- For example, science classes, I get bored easily"
rhgwIhB58PA,174200,177319,just listening and I think it's more interesting for me
rhgwIhB58PA,177320,179140,to actually be able to do it.
rhgwIhB58PA,179140,180750,- [Derek] How do you know that you're a visual learner?
rhgwIhB58PA,180750,182253,"- I don't, I just assumed."
rhgwIhB58PA,183380,185130,- To take advantage of learning styles
rhgwIhB58PA,185130,187520,then teachers need to do two things.
rhgwIhB58PA,187520,189780,"First, identify the learning style"
rhgwIhB58PA,189780,191120,of each of their students.
rhgwIhB58PA,191120,193330,"And second, teach each student"
rhgwIhB58PA,193330,195550,in accordance with their learning style.
rhgwIhB58PA,195550,199120,"On the VARK website it says, once you know about VARK,"
rhgwIhB58PA,199120,202720,its power to explain things will be a revelation.
rhgwIhB58PA,202720,205310,"But before you take an online learning styles quiz,"
rhgwIhB58PA,205310,209060,"it's a good idea to ask, do learning styles even exist?"
rhgwIhB58PA,209060,210260,"I mean, do you have one?"
rhgwIhB58PA,210260,212379,"And if you're taught in accordance with it,"
rhgwIhB58PA,212380,215320,would you learn better? (warm instrumental music)
rhgwIhB58PA,215320,216225,"Well, you could test this"
rhgwIhB58PA,216225,218363,by running a randomized control trial
rhgwIhB58PA,218363,220620,where first you would identify learners
rhgwIhB58PA,220620,222440,"with at least two different learning styles,"
rhgwIhB58PA,222440,226460,say visual and auditory and then randomly assign learners
rhgwIhB58PA,226460,228840,"to one of two educational presentations,"
rhgwIhB58PA,228840,230870,"one visual, one auditory."
rhgwIhB58PA,230870,232420,So for half of the students
rhgwIhB58PA,232420,234700,the experience will match their learning style
rhgwIhB58PA,234700,237000,and for the other half it won't.
rhgwIhB58PA,237000,239930,And then you give everyone the same test.
rhgwIhB58PA,239930,242349,"If the learning style hypothesis is correct,"
rhgwIhB58PA,242350,244270,the results should show better performance
rhgwIhB58PA,244270,247000,when the presentation matches the learning style
rhgwIhB58PA,247000,248613,than when they're mismatched.
rhgwIhB58PA,249830,252150,I tried a very unscientific version
rhgwIhB58PA,252150,254090,of this experiment on the street.
rhgwIhB58PA,254090,256638,"For some people, I matched their learning style"
rhgwIhB58PA,256638,261150,"so I showed visual learners pictures of 10 items,"
rhgwIhB58PA,261150,265819,but for other visual learners I read out the items instead.
rhgwIhB58PA,265819,269810,"Bell, penguin, sun."
rhgwIhB58PA,269810,270780,"- Okay, I'm maxed out."
rhgwIhB58PA,270780,272033,- [Derek] How many can you remember?
rhgwIhB58PA,272033,272866,- I don't know.
rhgwIhB58PA,272866,277280,"- Hair, knife, duck, heart, butterfly."
rhgwIhB58PA,278800,282229,"- Apple, bicycle, guitar."
rhgwIhB58PA,282230,283313,- There was a spider.
rhgwIhB58PA,284240,285400,Did I say eye already?
rhgwIhB58PA,285400,287040,"- Trumpet, pear. - Pear."
rhgwIhB58PA,287040,288340,- Butterfly. - Duck.
rhgwIhB58PA,288340,289350,- Knife. - Boat.
rhgwIhB58PA,289350,290200,- Heart. - Knife.
rhgwIhB58PA,290200,291033,- Heart.
rhgwIhB58PA,291033,293389,"- I couldn't tell you the rest, that's all I got."
rhgwIhB58PA,293390,294840,- [Derek] Most people could remember
rhgwIhB58PA,294840,296897,only about five or six things.
rhgwIhB58PA,296897,298227,"- Yeah, yeah. - Six, six is not bad."
rhgwIhB58PA,298227,299060,- All right.
rhgwIhB58PA,299060,300419,- Six. - Six out of 10
rhgwIhB58PA,300420,302007,"which is not bad, right? - Oh, all right, yeah."
rhgwIhB58PA,302007,303169,- That's a passing score.
rhgwIhB58PA,303170,304003,Candle. - Oh.
rhgwIhB58PA,304003,305474,- Candle. - Everyone forgets the candle.
rhgwIhB58PA,305475,308540,"But a few could remember substantially more,"
rhgwIhB58PA,308540,310380,"say, eight or nine items."
rhgwIhB58PA,310380,312432,"- Bug, I don't know if I said bug."
rhgwIhB58PA,312432,317432,"Guitar, bike, eye, bell, spoon, sun, chair."
rhgwIhB58PA,317450,318710,I'm forgetting the last two.
rhgwIhB58PA,318710,320270,- That's pretty good. - Eight is really good.
rhgwIhB58PA,320270,321103,"- Oh, cool."
rhgwIhB58PA,321103,322050,- Nine? - Nine out of 10.
rhgwIhB58PA,322050,324900,"- Nine, very impressive."
rhgwIhB58PA,324900,327509,But the reason didn't seem to be because the presentation
rhgwIhB58PA,327510,329930,matched their preferred learning style
rhgwIhB58PA,329930,333112,but because they employed a memory strategy.
rhgwIhB58PA,333112,336047,- So as you were showing I was making an order in my head.
rhgwIhB58PA,336047,339250,So as I saw more I would just add it to the list
rhgwIhB58PA,339250,341240,and I was repeating the list as I was looking at them
rhgwIhB58PA,341240,342599,so I could just say it out loud.
rhgwIhB58PA,342600,344788,- Did you try a strategy while you were looking
rhgwIhB58PA,344788,346580,"at those pictures? - Yeah, yeah."
rhgwIhB58PA,346580,349263,So I guess I tried creating a story
rhgwIhB58PA,349263,350780,'cause it's easier to remember a story
rhgwIhB58PA,350780,352660,than just individual objects.
rhgwIhB58PA,352660,355190,So I tried to tie it all into one story.
rhgwIhB58PA,355190,357370,"- This is all obviously anecdotal evidence,"
rhgwIhB58PA,357370,359810,but rigorous studies like the one I outlined
rhgwIhB58PA,359810,361220,have been conducted.
rhgwIhB58PA,361220,364790,"For example, one looked at visualizers versus verbalizers"
rhgwIhB58PA,364790,366966,instead of visual versus auditory learners.
rhgwIhB58PA,366966,369600,"The study was computer-based,"
rhgwIhB58PA,369600,371870,so first students' learning styles were assessed
rhgwIhB58PA,371870,375020,"using questions like, would you rather read a paragraph"
rhgwIhB58PA,375020,377440,or see a diagram describing an atom?
rhgwIhB58PA,377440,380520,The researchers also provided some challenging explanations
rhgwIhB58PA,380520,384110,"with two buttons, visual help or verbal help."
rhgwIhB58PA,384110,386289,The visual one played a short animation
rhgwIhB58PA,386290,389670,whereas the verbal help gave a written explanation.
rhgwIhB58PA,389670,392100,"From these measures combined, the researchers categorized"
rhgwIhB58PA,392100,395280,the students as either visualizers or verbalizers
rhgwIhB58PA,395280,397470,and then the students were randomly assigned
rhgwIhB58PA,397470,399090,to go through a text-based
rhgwIhB58PA,399090,402220,or picture-based lesson on electronics.
rhgwIhB58PA,402220,404460,When a student hovered their mouse over key words
rhgwIhB58PA,404460,406560,"in the lesson in the text-based group,"
rhgwIhB58PA,406560,408810,a definition and clarification came up.
rhgwIhB58PA,408810,410130,"But in the picture group,"
rhgwIhB58PA,410130,412780,an annotated diagram was shown instead.
rhgwIhB58PA,412780,415100,"And after the lesson, the students did a test"
rhgwIhB58PA,415100,416710,to assess their learning.
rhgwIhB58PA,416710,418470,The students whose preferred learning style
rhgwIhB58PA,418470,422560,matched their instruction performed no better on the tests
rhgwIhB58PA,422560,425200,than those whose instruction was mismatched.
rhgwIhB58PA,425200,426810,The researchers ran the test again
rhgwIhB58PA,426810,429250,with 61 non-college-educated adults
rhgwIhB58PA,429250,431364,and found exactly the same result.
rhgwIhB58PA,431364,433886,But learning styles are a preference
rhgwIhB58PA,433886,437710,so how strongly do learners stick to their preference?
rhgwIhB58PA,437710,440630,"Well, in a 2018 study during the first week of semester,"
rhgwIhB58PA,440630,443440,over 400 students at a university in Indiana
rhgwIhB58PA,443440,446480,completed the VARK questionnaire and they were classified
rhgwIhB58PA,446480,448100,according to their learning style.
rhgwIhB58PA,448100,449320,Then at the end of the semester
rhgwIhB58PA,449320,452374,the same students completed a study strategy questionnaire.
rhgwIhB58PA,452374,455780,So how did they actually study during the term?
rhgwIhB58PA,455780,457709,"Well, an overwhelming majority of students"
rhgwIhB58PA,457709,460681,used study strategies which were supposedly incompatible
rhgwIhB58PA,460681,462580,"with their learning style,"
rhgwIhB58PA,462580,464117,and the minority of students who did
rhgwIhB58PA,464118,466370,did not perform significantly differently
rhgwIhB58PA,466370,468553,on the assessments in the course.
rhgwIhB58PA,468553,471120,"The visual auditory reading-writing, kinesthetic"
rhgwIhB58PA,471120,473919,"or VARK model came about from Neil Fleming,"
rhgwIhB58PA,473920,476040,a school inspector in New Zealand.
rhgwIhB58PA,476040,478390,"Describing the origins of VARK he says,"
rhgwIhB58PA,478390,480540,I was puzzled when I observed excellent teachers
rhgwIhB58PA,480540,484220,who did not reach some learners and poor teachers who did.
rhgwIhB58PA,484220,486360,I decided to try to solve this puzzle.
rhgwIhB58PA,486360,489539,"There are, of course, many reasons for what I observed."
rhgwIhB58PA,489540,492500,"But one topic that seemed to hold some magic,"
rhgwIhB58PA,492500,494150,"some explanatory power,"
rhgwIhB58PA,494150,497850,"was preferred modes of learning, modal preferences."
rhgwIhB58PA,497850,500240,"And thus, VARK was born."
rhgwIhB58PA,500240,502020,There was no study that revealed
rhgwIhB58PA,502020,504979,students naturally cluster into four distinct groups.
rhgwIhB58PA,504980,506720,Just some magic that might explain
rhgwIhB58PA,506720,509930,why some teachers can reach students while others can't.
rhgwIhB58PA,509930,511430,But how can this be?
rhgwIhB58PA,511430,513649,If we accept that some people are more skilled
rhgwIhB58PA,513650,515960,at interpreting and remembering certain kinds of stimuli
rhgwIhB58PA,515960,518659,"than others like visual or auditory,"
rhgwIhB58PA,518659,521180,then why don't we see differences in learning
rhgwIhB58PA,521180,523599,or recall with different presentations?
rhgwIhB58PA,523599,526480,"Well, it's because what we actually want people to recall"
rhgwIhB58PA,526480,528810,is not the precise nature of the images
rhgwIhB58PA,528810,531010,or the pitch or quality of the sound.
rhgwIhB58PA,531010,533212,It's the meaning behind the presentations.
rhgwIhB58PA,533212,535889,There are some tasks that obviously require the use
rhgwIhB58PA,535890,537520,of a particular modality.
rhgwIhB58PA,537520,539130,"Learning about music, for example,"
rhgwIhB58PA,539130,541180,should have an auditory component.
rhgwIhB58PA,541180,542910,"Similarly, learning about geography"
rhgwIhB58PA,542910,545055,will involve looking at maps.
rhgwIhB58PA,545055,547540,And some people will have greater aptitude
rhgwIhB58PA,547540,549310,to learn one task over another.
rhgwIhB58PA,549310,551090,"Someone with perfect pitch, for example,"
rhgwIhB58PA,551090,553830,will be better able to recall certain tones in music.
rhgwIhB58PA,553830,555820,Someone with excellent visual-spatial reasoning
rhgwIhB58PA,555820,557460,will be better at learning the locations
rhgwIhB58PA,557460,558870,of countries on a map.
rhgwIhB58PA,558870,560730,But the claim of learning style theories
rhgwIhB58PA,560730,561990,is that these preferences
rhgwIhB58PA,561990,564792,will be consistent across learning domains.
rhgwIhB58PA,564792,566870,The person with perfect pitch
rhgwIhB58PA,566870,569157,should learn everything better auditorily
rhgwIhB58PA,569157,571779,but that is clearly not the case.
rhgwIhB58PA,571780,574633,Most people will learn geography better with a map.
rhgwIhB58PA,575940,578910,Review articles of learning styles consistently conclude
rhgwIhB58PA,578910,583029,there is no credible evidence that learning styles exist.
rhgwIhB58PA,583030,586360,"In a 2009 review, the researchers note, the contrast"
rhgwIhB58PA,586360,588100,between the enormous popularity
rhgwIhB58PA,588100,590630,of the learning styles approach within education
rhgwIhB58PA,590630,594060,"and the lack of credible evidence for its utility is,"
rhgwIhB58PA,594060,597250,"in our opinion, striking and disturbing."
rhgwIhB58PA,597250,599080,If classification of students' learning styles
rhgwIhB58PA,599080,602870,"has practical utility, it remains to be demonstrated."
rhgwIhB58PA,602870,606210,"- What we're expecting is, if your style was honored"
rhgwIhB58PA,606210,608320,you're going to perform better than if
rhgwIhB58PA,608320,610880,you had some experience that conflicted with your style.
rhgwIhB58PA,610880,613710,And this is where we don't see any support
rhgwIhB58PA,613710,615730,for the learning styles theory.
rhgwIhB58PA,615730,617581,- One of the reasons many people find learning styles
rhgwIhB58PA,617581,621720,so convincing is because they already believe it to be true.
rhgwIhB58PA,621720,623287,"For example, they might already think"
rhgwIhB58PA,623288,626060,"that they're a visual learner, and then when a teacher"
rhgwIhB58PA,626060,629000,"shows them a diagram of, say, a bike pump"
rhgwIhB58PA,629000,630920,"and suddenly the concept clicks,"
rhgwIhB58PA,630920,632660,"well, they interpret this as evidence"
rhgwIhB58PA,632660,634310,for their visual learning style.
rhgwIhB58PA,634310,636810,- You already believe that learning styles is right.
rhgwIhB58PA,636810,639600,"When you have an experience the first think you think is,"
rhgwIhB58PA,639600,642259,is that in some way consistent with learning styles?
rhgwIhB58PA,642260,643830,"And if it is, you don't think further."
rhgwIhB58PA,643830,647250,- When in reality that diagram might just be a great diagram
rhgwIhB58PA,647250,649240,that would have helped anyone learn.
rhgwIhB58PA,649240,652230,"When we already believe the world to be a certain way,"
rhgwIhB58PA,652230,655690,then we interpret new experiences to fit with those beliefs
rhgwIhB58PA,655690,657908,whether they actually do or not.
rhgwIhB58PA,657908,659610,So if learning styles
rhgwIhB58PA,659610,662440,"don't improve learning, then what does?"
rhgwIhB58PA,662440,663720,"Well, there's a large body of literature"
rhgwIhB58PA,663720,665980,that supports the claim that everyone learns better
rhgwIhB58PA,665980,667329,with multimodal approaches
rhgwIhB58PA,667330,669980,where words and pictures are presented together
rhgwIhB58PA,669980,672600,rather than either words or pictures alone.
rhgwIhB58PA,672600,675089,Now there's gonna be words as well as the picture.
rhgwIhB58PA,675090,677060,We're gonna see if this is any better.
rhgwIhB58PA,677060,679500,"This is known as the multimedia effect,"
rhgwIhB58PA,679500,681430,"and it explains in part, at least,"
rhgwIhB58PA,681430,684220,why videos can be such powerful tools for learning
rhgwIhB58PA,684220,686920,when the narration complements the visuals.
rhgwIhB58PA,686920,688013,Duck. - Duck.
rhgwIhB58PA,690134,691720,- Heart. - Heart.
rhgwIhB58PA,691720,694439,"- [Derek] In my PhD research, I found explicit discussion"
rhgwIhB58PA,694440,696140,of misconceptions was essential
rhgwIhB58PA,696140,698830,in multimedia teaching for introductory physics.
rhgwIhB58PA,698830,700050,- How many is that? - Six.
rhgwIhB58PA,700050,701029,"- Six, okay, that's good."
rhgwIhB58PA,701030,703490,- That is a whole 50% better.
rhgwIhB58PA,703490,704948,Do you think that was easier?
rhgwIhB58PA,704948,707980,"- Yeah, yeah, 100%, 100%. - Yeah, with the words, yeah."
rhgwIhB58PA,707980,710214,"- Ultimately, the most important thing for learning"
rhgwIhB58PA,710214,712980,is not the way the information is presented
rhgwIhB58PA,712980,715990,but what is happening inside the learner's head.
rhgwIhB58PA,715990,718310,People learn best when they're actively thinking
rhgwIhB58PA,718310,720450,"about the material, solving problems"
rhgwIhB58PA,720450,724010,or imagining what happens if different variables change.
rhgwIhB58PA,724010,726290,I talked about how and why we learn best
rhgwIhB58PA,726290,729690,"in my video, ""The Science of Thinking"" so check that out."
rhgwIhB58PA,729690,731960,"Now, the truth is, there are many evidence-based"
rhgwIhB58PA,731960,734220,teaching methods that improve learning.
rhgwIhB58PA,734220,737810,Learning styles is just not one of them.
rhgwIhB58PA,737810,740210,"And it is likely, given the prevalence"
rhgwIhB58PA,740210,741830,of the learning styles misconception
rhgwIhB58PA,741830,744210,that it actually makes learning worse.
rhgwIhB58PA,744210,747130,"I mean, learning styles give teachers unnecessary things"
rhgwIhB58PA,747130,749640,"to worry about, and they make some students reluctant"
rhgwIhB58PA,749640,752650,to engage with certain types of instruction.
rhgwIhB58PA,752650,755220,And all the time and money spent on learning styles
rhgwIhB58PA,755220,757720,and related training could be better spent on interventions
rhgwIhB58PA,757720,760180,that actually improve learning.
rhgwIhB58PA,760180,764080,You are not a visual learner nor an auditory learner
rhgwIhB58PA,764080,767130,"nor a kinesthetic learner, or more accurately,"
rhgwIhB58PA,767130,770400,you are all these kinds of learner in one.
rhgwIhB58PA,770400,772470,The best learning experiences are those
rhgwIhB58PA,772470,774318,that involve multiple different ways
rhgwIhB58PA,774318,776620,of understanding the same thing.
rhgwIhB58PA,776620,778610,"And best of all, this strategy works"
rhgwIhB58PA,778610,783435,not just for one subset of people but for everyone.

rhgwIhB58PA,790160,791730,"Now, there are lots of topics out there"
rhgwIhB58PA,791730,794959,"that are controversial like learning styles, for example."
rhgwIhB58PA,794960,797690,Most people believe learning styles are a thing
rhgwIhB58PA,797690,799270,whereas educational researchers
rhgwIhB58PA,799270,801400,find no robust evidence for them.
rhgwIhB58PA,801400,803279,"And if you search for learning styles,"
rhgwIhB58PA,803279,806520,you'll get lots of sites with resources and quizzes.
rhgwIhB58PA,806520,809130,"But if you search for learning styles debunked,"
rhgwIhB58PA,809130,810810,"well, then you'll find articles"
rhgwIhB58PA,810810,812630,about how there is very little evidence
rhgwIhB58PA,812630,814630,for the learning styles hypothesis.
rhgwIhB58PA,814630,817475,I think one of the most common traps people fall into
rhgwIhB58PA,817475,819470,is only searching for information
rhgwIhB58PA,819470,821750,that confirms what they already believe.
rhgwIhB58PA,821750,824420,A common mistake is putting the answer you're looking for
rhgwIhB58PA,824420,826139,right in the search query.
rhgwIhB58PA,826140,828620,"A better idea is to try another search,"
rhgwIhB58PA,828620,831510,adding debunked or false at the end and see what comes up.
rhgwIhB58PA,831510,833630,And Google makes it easy to get more detail
rhgwIhB58PA,833630,835570,about the source of the information.
rhgwIhB58PA,835570,838250,Just click the three dots next to any search result
rhgwIhB58PA,838250,839880,and then you can judge for yourself
rhgwIhB58PA,839880,841540,whether the information is trustworthy
rhgwIhB58PA,841540,842910,and if you want to visit the site.
rhgwIhB58PA,842910,844509,A Google Search is meant to surface
rhgwIhB58PA,844510,847360,the most relevant information for your query.
rhgwIhB58PA,847360,850160,"But it's up to you to formulate that query,"
rhgwIhB58PA,850160,851529,"try a few different searches,"
rhgwIhB58PA,851530,854570,and assess whether the information is reliable.
rhgwIhB58PA,854570,857300,And the whole point of Veritasium is to get to the truth.
rhgwIhB58PA,857300,858850,So I'm excited to encourage everyone
rhgwIhB58PA,858850,862069,to think more critically about how we get information.
rhgwIhB58PA,862070,864360,I want to thank Google for sponsoring this part of the video
