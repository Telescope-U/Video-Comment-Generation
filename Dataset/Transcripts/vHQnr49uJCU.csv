vHQnr49uJCU,399,2480,russia's war on ukraine is pushing the
vHQnr49uJCU,2480,4720,world's most vulnerable countries into a
vHQnr49uJCU,4720,7279,food security crisis many of these
vHQnr49uJCU,7279,10000,states are in africa which rely heavily
vHQnr49uJCU,10000,12080,on russia and ukraine for wheat
vHQnr49uJCU,12080,14880,fertilizer and vegetable oil imports
vHQnr49uJCU,14880,16800,earlier this week ukrainian president
vHQnr49uJCU,16800,19279,vladimir zelinsky told the african union
vHQnr49uJCU,19279,22480,the situation is catastrophic
vHQnr49uJCU,22480,24560,africa
vHQnr49uJCU,24560,26880,africa is actually a hostage it is a
vHQnr49uJCU,26880,29199,hostage of those who unleashed war
vHQnr49uJCU,29199,31039,against our state
vHQnr49uJCU,31039,33280,if it wasn't for the russian war people
vHQnr49uJCU,33280,36320,in africa people in asia and elsewhere
vHQnr49uJCU,36320,38160,in the world would not suffer from the
vHQnr49uJCU,38160,42920,catastrophic rise in food prices
vHQnr49uJCU,44079,45920,well the fighting has disrupted global
vHQnr49uJCU,45920,48160,commodity markets and trade to the
vHQnr49uJCU,48160,50879,african continent raising food prices
vHQnr49uJCU,50879,53440,and creating more shortages as world
vHQnr49uJCU,53440,55440,leaders gather in germany to address the
vHQnr49uJCU,55440,57920,looming global hunger crisis we'll find
vHQnr49uJCU,57920,59840,out what can be done to make african
vHQnr49uJCU,59840,62320,nations more self-sufficient but first
vHQnr49uJCU,62320,64878,we go to darfur in western sudan where
vHQnr49uJCU,64878,67200,there's an urgent need to alleviate
vHQnr49uJCU,67200,70000,growing hunger
vHQnr49uJCU,70000,73680,there's food but hardly any customers
vHQnr49uJCU,73680,75920,people here in eastern dafor
vHQnr49uJCU,75920,79119,simply can't afford what's on offer
vHQnr49uJCU,79119,81759,even before the war in ukraine prices
vHQnr49uJCU,81759,85360,here increased by 700 percent
vHQnr49uJCU,85360,88640,this year prices jumped again by another
vHQnr49uJCU,88640,90400,200 percent
vHQnr49uJCU,90400,92560,for millions in sudan and across
vHQnr49uJCU,92560,95200,sub-saharan africa the situation is
vHQnr49uJCU,95200,98479,becoming unbearable
vHQnr49uJCU,98799,101200,since last year the u.n have stopped the
vHQnr49uJCU,101200,103520,food distribution to us
vHQnr49uJCU,103520,105920,more than 75 percent of the people in
vHQnr49uJCU,105920,108159,this camp have been left out of the u.n
vHQnr49uJCU,108159,109680,system
vHQnr49uJCU,109680,111920,the few people who still get food aid
vHQnr49uJCU,111920,116399,have their rations cut by 20 percent
vHQnr49uJCU,118479,120799,salva was first displaced by the war in
vHQnr49uJCU,120799,123360,the four in 2006.
vHQnr49uJCU,123360,125759,her and her family walked for months to
vHQnr49uJCU,125759,127840,get to safety here in this camp in
vHQnr49uJCU,127840,129360,eastern therefore
vHQnr49uJCU,129360,131760,since then she and her five children
vHQnr49uJCU,131760,134879,have all been dependent on food handouts
vHQnr49uJCU,134879,137680,but in the last few months this aid has
vHQnr49uJCU,137680,141640,almost dried up
vHQnr49uJCU,143120,144720,my message to the international
vHQnr49uJCU,144720,145760,community
vHQnr49uJCU,145760,147760,if they really know the meaning of human
vHQnr49uJCU,147760,149840,beings they should provide food to
vHQnr49uJCU,149840,152400,everyone who is affected by war
vHQnr49uJCU,152400,156920,and we need peace and security
vHQnr49uJCU,158480,161280,in both east and west are four most aid
vHQnr49uJCU,161280,162959,agencies have stopped their work
vHQnr49uJCU,162959,164800,completely
vHQnr49uJCU,164800,167840,the only aid arriving is for emergencies
vHQnr49uJCU,167840,170000,like here in krennic after a recent
vHQnr49uJCU,170000,171440,deadly attack
vHQnr49uJCU,171440,174160,the war in ukraine has forced the un and
vHQnr49uJCU,174160,177280,other agencies to even cut this help by
vHQnr49uJCU,177280,180080,more than half
vHQnr49uJCU,180879,184000,for salva and her family this means they
vHQnr49uJCU,184000,187280,and millions of others in sudan now face
vHQnr49uJCU,187280,190720,a devastating future
vHQnr49uJCU,192720,194720,for more on this i'm joined by carlos
vHQnr49uJCU,194720,196560,lopez he is a professor at the
vHQnr49uJCU,196560,198400,university of cape town it's good to
vHQnr49uJCU,198400,200720,have you with us here on dw news africa
vHQnr49uJCU,200720,203280,now how concerning is food insecurity
vHQnr49uJCU,203280,205680,for african nations right now given the
vHQnr49uJCU,205680,208400,war in ukraine
vHQnr49uJCU,208400,209200,well
vHQnr49uJCU,209200,210959,some countries more than others but in
vHQnr49uJCU,210959,214400,general africa imports about 35 billion
vHQnr49uJCU,214400,216400,dollars worth of food
vHQnr49uJCU,216400,219200,every year and a lot of it comes from
vHQnr49uJCU,219200,222640,russia and ukraine when it refers to
vHQnr49uJCU,222640,223920,cereals
vHQnr49uJCU,223920,227440,with countries like egypt somalia sudan
vHQnr49uJCU,227440,228879,tanzania
vHQnr49uJCU,228879,230560,and also
vHQnr49uJCU,230560,233599,senegal having a very large
vHQnr49uJCU,233599,236400,dependency on food imports from that
vHQnr49uJCU,236400,237920,part of the world
vHQnr49uJCU,237920,240159,but why is the continent so dependent on
vHQnr49uJCU,240159,242799,these imports when it's said to have
vHQnr49uJCU,242799,246000,about 60 of the world's unused arable
vHQnr49uJCU,246000,248239,land
vHQnr49uJCU,248239,250319,well it's a combination of factors i
vHQnr49uJCU,250319,252080,think the most important is that we have
vHQnr49uJCU,252080,255360,treated agriculture as a social area not
vHQnr49uJCU,255360,257600,as an economic opportunity and the
vHQnr49uJCU,257600,259919,policies that have been put in place by
vHQnr49uJCU,259919,262560,both the countries and the donuts to
vHQnr49uJCU,262560,265600,deal with the primary sector have been
vHQnr49uJCU,265600,266800,very much
vHQnr49uJCU,266800,268560,reliable on
vHQnr49uJCU,268560,270880,how to address issues of resilience
vHQnr49uJCU,270880,273680,vulnerabilities poverty reduction but
vHQnr49uJCU,273680,276240,not necessarily transformative in terms
vHQnr49uJCU,276240,278639,of increasing the yields character
vHQnr49uJCU,278639,281040,increasing productivity and making sure
vHQnr49uJCU,281040,284160,that african agriculture is modernized
vHQnr49uJCU,284160,284880,and
vHQnr49uJCU,284880,287040,benefits from technology like
vHQnr49uJCU,287040,288800,irrigation
vHQnr49uJCU,288800,291280,so when you say looking at investing in
vHQnr49uJCU,291280,293040,agriculture might be the way forward for
vHQnr49uJCU,293040,295840,africa is there enough investment and
vHQnr49uJCU,295840,299840,political will to achieve this though
vHQnr49uJCU,300000,301840,well we need much more because the
vHQnr49uJCU,301840,304479,access to finance is a major constraint
vHQnr49uJCU,304479,307440,for african economies in general
vHQnr49uJCU,307440,309919,they pay more than the rest of the world
vHQnr49uJCU,309919,311680,in terms of
vHQnr49uJCU,311680,313840,sovereign debt and also access to
vHQnr49uJCU,313840,316160,commercial debt in general
vHQnr49uJCU,316160,318639,partly because of the evaluation of risk
vHQnr49uJCU,318639,321039,in africa being unfair
vHQnr49uJCU,321039,323280,for the same macro indicators treating
vHQnr49uJCU,323280,325199,africa with a premium
vHQnr49uJCU,325199,328080,of risk that is not justified
vHQnr49uJCU,328080,330560,and partly also because the economic
vHQnr49uJCU,330560,332960,policy of the african countries has been
vHQnr49uJCU,332960,335520,oriented towards exporting commodities
vHQnr49uJCU,335520,338080,that are producing rent for the elites
vHQnr49uJCU,338080,339759,rather than actually
vHQnr49uJCU,339759,342160,dealing with the rest of the economy and
vHQnr49uJCU,342160,344080,partly also because of the levels of
vHQnr49uJCU,344080,346880,informality being so high so unless we
vHQnr49uJCU,346880,349600,address these issues uh comprehensively
vHQnr49uJCU,349600,351440,it's not possible really to have the
vHQnr49uJCU,351440,353680,kind of transformation that is required
vHQnr49uJCU,353680,355759,what can the international community do
vHQnr49uJCU,355759,358880,to step up as support to african nations
vHQnr49uJCU,358880,361759,now to ensure that there is affordable
vHQnr49uJCU,361759,364319,food access and it's sustainable and
vHQnr49uJCU,364319,366960,self-sufficient for them
vHQnr49uJCU,366960,369280,stop treating africa just when there is
vHQnr49uJCU,369280,371440,a crisis like now there is a crisis of
vHQnr49uJCU,371440,374000,drought apart from the crisis provoked
vHQnr49uJCU,374000,377039,by the inflation and the lack of
vHQnr49uJCU,377039,381120,access to food from ukraine and russia
vHQnr49uJCU,381120,383360,we need to deal with issues in a
vHQnr49uJCU,383360,385600,structural manner not with the
vHQnr49uJCU,385600,387840,short-term vision as it has been mostly
vHQnr49uJCU,387840,390560,the case and we need to stop this food
vHQnr49uJCU,390560,394000,security interpretation that is dealing
vHQnr49uJCU,394000,396639,basically with immediate needs rather
vHQnr49uJCU,396639,398479,than introducing the changes that are
vHQnr49uJCU,398479,399520,required
vHQnr49uJCU,399520,402240,for agriculture to be very much part of
vHQnr49uJCU,402240,404479,the growth story in in africa we have
vHQnr49uJCU,404479,407440,about 23 percent of africa's gdp that
vHQnr49uJCU,407440,409599,depends on the primary sector uh the
vHQnr49uJCU,409599,411759,potential for increasing that is quite
vHQnr49uJCU,411759,412800,immense
vHQnr49uJCU,412800,415120,and when you know that uh
vHQnr49uJCU,415120,417599,the first line of consumption of the
vHQnr49uJCU,417599,420160,people that leave the poverty line is
vHQnr49uJCU,420160,422639,actually to consume food and when you
vHQnr49uJCU,422639,425360,know that africa has a level of
vHQnr49uJCU,425360,427680,urbanization that is increasing very
vHQnr49uJCU,427680,430000,fast about 50 percent of population
vHQnr49uJCU,430000,432080,right now you need to tackle these
vHQnr49uJCU,432080,434400,issues in a completely different manner
vHQnr49uJCU,434400,436800,from what has been the case so far okay
vHQnr49uJCU,436800,438639,carlos lopez speaking to us from cape
vHQnr49uJCU,438639,440560,town thank you very much indeed for your
vHQnr49uJCU,440560,442160,time
vHQnr49uJCU,442160,444479,thank you
vHQnr49uJCU,444479,446479,and south africa is also feeling the
vHQnr49uJCU,446479,449199,effects of the war in ukraine the covert
vHQnr49uJCU,449199,451599,19 pandemic already triggered a growing
vHQnr49uJCU,451599,454479,economic crisis and now surging food
vHQnr49uJCU,454479,457520,prices and unemployment is forcing many
vHQnr49uJCU,457520,459680,into homelessness but one centre is
vHQnr49uJCU,459680,461919,trying to keep people off the streets
vHQnr49uJCU,461919,464560,dw's agent kriesch has a story from cape
vHQnr49uJCU,464560,465919,town
vHQnr49uJCU,465919,467919,thank you very much for the food
vHQnr49uJCU,467919,469840,queueing up for food handed out by a
vHQnr49uJCU,469840,471599,charity for homeless people in the
vHQnr49uJCU,471599,473680,middle of cape town simi engelbrecht
vHQnr49uJCU,473680,475680,hasn't had a warm meal for a long time
vHQnr49uJCU,475680,477199,she's been living on the streets for
vHQnr49uJCU,477199,478879,more than four years
vHQnr49uJCU,478879,481280,i come to a point whereby i hit it
vHQnr49uJCU,481280,483680,because there's no
vHQnr49uJCU,483680,485440,you don't move in there's no way that
vHQnr49uJCU,485440,487680,you can move forward in life there's no
vHQnr49uJCU,487680,490800,way that you can build yourself up
vHQnr49uJCU,490800,493280,in life while you're still on the street
vHQnr49uJCU,493280,494160,because
vHQnr49uJCU,494160,496319,i tried it many times which it didn't
vHQnr49uJCU,496319,497360,work
vHQnr49uJCU,497360,499360,engelbrecht is not alone and since the
vHQnr49uJCU,499360,501680,pandemic hit even more people have been
vHQnr49uJCU,501680,504000,forced to live on the street
vHQnr49uJCU,504000,506000,camps and makeshift shelters like this
vHQnr49uJCU,506000,507759,have been mushrooming in the city of
vHQnr49uJCU,507759,510639,cape town there are about 7 000 homeless
vHQnr49uJCU,510639,513599,people in the city much more than before
vHQnr49uJCU,513599,514959,lockdown
vHQnr49uJCU,514959,517440,the city runs a safe place program for
vHQnr49uJCU,517440,519200,homeless people but currently there are
vHQnr49uJCU,519200,521680,only about 50 free spaces available each
vHQnr49uJCU,521680,524560,night the rest is occupied cape town
vHQnr49uJCU,524560,526240,wants to create hundreds of additional
vHQnr49uJCU,526240,528160,spaces but the mayor says the lack of
vHQnr49uJCU,528160,530000,support from the national government
vHQnr49uJCU,530000,532560,makes it impossible to solve the problem
vHQnr49uJCU,532560,534720,the core of the problem here is that the
vHQnr49uJCU,534720,536959,healthcare system is not capacitated
vHQnr49uJCU,536959,538720,enough to deal with the scale of this
vHQnr49uJCU,538720,539680,problem
vHQnr49uJCU,539680,541760,we are picking up the pieces at the end
vHQnr49uJCU,541760,544560,of this all of these other failures
vHQnr49uJCU,544560,546160,uh there's been a poverty failure
vHQnr49uJCU,546160,548800,there's been a
vHQnr49uJCU,548800,551120,domestic violence failure often that the
vHQnr49uJCU,551120,552640,system has not
vHQnr49uJCU,552640,553920,coped with
vHQnr49uJCU,553920,555839,there has been a mental breakdown
vHQnr49uJCU,555839,557519,failure and then a substance abuse
vHQnr49uJCU,557519,559440,failure along with the rise in
vHQnr49uJCU,559440,561600,homelessness south africa is also
vHQnr49uJCU,561600,563839,dealing with an unemployment crisis
vHQnr49uJCU,563839,566560,every third person here is jobless now
vHQnr49uJCU,566560,569040,rising costs of living driven by the war
vHQnr49uJCU,569040,571279,in ukraine are making things worse for
vHQnr49uJCU,571279,572480,everyone
vHQnr49uJCU,572480,574959,cooking oil has gone up by almost 50
vHQnr49uJCU,574959,577360,percent fuel by 20.
vHQnr49uJCU,577360,579680,it does affect everyone because
vHQnr49uJCU,579680,581920,as you know it affects the prices of the
vHQnr49uJCU,581920,584320,basic commodities in the shops but now
vHQnr49uJCU,584320,586000,the salaries of people are not going up
vHQnr49uJCU,586000,588240,people can't live like this anymore it's
vHQnr49uJCU,588240,591519,it's crazy it's chaos we are in a chaos
vHQnr49uJCU,591519,592880,world now
vHQnr49uJCU,592880,594640,in the state we're living in the prices
vHQnr49uJCU,594640,597279,of just going up and up and up
vHQnr49uJCU,597279,598959,the government has acknowledged the
vHQnr49uJCU,598959,600959,problem but has failed to provide a
vHQnr49uJCU,600959,603839,solution aimed at a shortage of funds
vHQnr49uJCU,603839,607279,in recent times
vHQnr49uJCU,607279,609360,we are having to deal with another
vHQnr49uJCU,609360,610320,problem
vHQnr49uJCU,610320,613200,which is the rising cost of living
vHQnr49uJCU,613200,616800,has made it increasingly difficult
vHQnr49uJCU,616800,619680,for the majority of our people to get by
