QNPGTGCJkdY,3360,6080,all the rest they're still afraid into
QNPGTGCJkdY,6080,8559,this room too traumatized to come to
QNPGTGCJkdY,8559,10960,grips with it why do you think cabbage
QNPGTGCJkdY,10960,12960,wanted you to play so many games with
QNPGTGCJkdY,12960,14799,her she wanted you to remember what
QNPGTGCJkdY,14799,17279,happened here and now you're talking to
QNPGTGCJkdY,17279,20000,a potato and obviously you're not
QNPGTGCJkdY,20000,22800,remembering anything goodbye
QNPGTGCJkdY,22800,25359,for now and you see that's what happens
QNPGTGCJkdY,25359,27599,when you talk to a potato instead of me
QNPGTGCJkdY,27599,30000,here you may not remember but i
QNPGTGCJkdY,30000,32078,certainly do so let me fill in those
QNPGTGCJkdY,32078,33680,blanks
QNPGTGCJkdY,33680,37200,[Music]
QNPGTGCJkdY,37200,40480,hello internet welcome to game theory
QNPGTGCJkdY,40480,42239,the show that would never think of
QNPGTGCJkdY,42239,44000,eating its friends because it doesn't
QNPGTGCJkdY,44000,45360,have any but hey you could become a
QNPGTGCJkdY,45360,46559,friend of the channel by hitting the
QNPGTGCJkdY,46559,48160,subscribe button don't worry you're not
QNPGTGCJkdY,48160,50320,within stabbing distance or anything so
QNPGTGCJkdY,50320,52239,everyone wins last time we began to
QNPGTGCJkdY,52239,54480,dissect the tasty lore hidden inside of
QNPGTGCJkdY,54480,56640,cooking companions a game that begins as
QNPGTGCJkdY,56640,59120,your classic dating sim visual novel and
QNPGTGCJkdY,59120,61039,ends with an anime knife fight set in
QNPGTGCJkdY,61039,62399,the basement while an audience of
QNPGTGCJkdY,62399,65040,sentient vegetables root you on also
QNPGTGCJkdY,65040,67680,cannibalism a lot of cannibalism and
QNPGTGCJkdY,67680,69760,although that was already plenty there's
QNPGTGCJkdY,69760,71840,even more going on beneath the surface
QNPGTGCJkdY,71840,73360,last time we discovered that our four
QNPGTGCJkdY,73360,75200,companions were actually refugees
QNPGTGCJkdY,75200,76799,escaping from ukraine during the
QNPGTGCJkdY,76799,78799,horrible famine known as holotamor we
QNPGTGCJkdY,78799,81280,also figured out that we play as the old
QNPGTGCJkdY,81280,83600,hag baba yaga a character from slavic
QNPGTGCJkdY,83600,85759,folklore who asks you one question and
QNPGTGCJkdY,85759,87759,then eats you when you answer wrong
QNPGTGCJkdY,87759,90159,spoiler alert these guys answered wrong
QNPGTGCJkdY,90159,92079,but even that doesn't appear to be the
QNPGTGCJkdY,92079,94000,whole story although we appear to be the
QNPGTGCJkdY,94000,95759,baba yaga it seems like there might have
QNPGTGCJkdY,95759,98400,been more baba yagas before us there's
QNPGTGCJkdY,98400,100159,one key line from our talking vegetable
QNPGTGCJkdY,100159,101439,friends that makes it seem like if we
QNPGTGCJkdY,101439,103680,lose our cannibalism companion karen
QNPGTGCJkdY,103680,105920,will take our place trumpets we can't
QNPGTGCJkdY,105920,108159,allow karen to take over the cabin plus
QNPGTGCJkdY,108159,109840,inside the cabin are hidden notes that
QNPGTGCJkdY,109840,111920,date back hundreds of years to the late
QNPGTGCJkdY,111920,114560,1700s leading me to believe that maybe
QNPGTGCJkdY,114560,116719,we haven't actually been here forever as
QNPGTGCJkdY,116719,118719,the baba yaga but instead are possessed
QNPGTGCJkdY,118719,120719,by the spirit of her a spirit that has
QNPGTGCJkdY,120719,122719,passed from person to person over the
QNPGTGCJkdY,122719,125040,decades that at least was my theory my
QNPGTGCJkdY,125040,128399,initial theory but could i prove it what
QNPGTGCJkdY,128399,130959,actually drew us into this cabin what is
QNPGTGCJkdY,130959,133200,our backstory well to explain all of
QNPGTGCJkdY,133200,135120,that and to truly understand what's
QNPGTGCJkdY,135120,136879,going on inside of this game beyond just
QNPGTGCJkdY,136879,139040,the feast of flesh we have to talk about
QNPGTGCJkdY,139040,141120,the chompats
QNPGTGCJkdY,141120,143120,these guys are all over the artwork for
QNPGTGCJkdY,143120,145200,this game and you can see why the kauai
QNPGTGCJkdY,145200,146720,little edibles lighten up what would
QNPGTGCJkdY,146720,148800,otherwise be a completely grim horror
QNPGTGCJkdY,148800,150800,story of starvation inside of a stranded
QNPGTGCJkdY,150800,152959,cabin in total we have ourselves five
QNPGTGCJkdY,152959,154800,key members of the champetz cabbage
QNPGTGCJkdY,154800,156000,leader of the group who likes to
QNPGTGCJkdY,156000,157680,organize games for the others to play
QNPGTGCJkdY,157680,159920,onion the comedian though not sure
QNPGTGCJkdY,159920,161840,calling a stinky over and over again is
QNPGTGCJkdY,161840,163840,actually that funny bread the lover of
QNPGTGCJkdY,163840,165920,puns the vaguely threatening raspberry
QNPGTGCJkdY,165920,168480,and the grumpy non-participatory potato
QNPGTGCJkdY,168480,170160,there's also frequent references to a
QNPGTGCJkdY,170160,172640,missing sixth chompet cornbread but he's
QNPGTGCJkdY,172640,174080,not around anymore throughout the game
QNPGTGCJkdY,174080,175840,these guys pop in to make jokes unlock
QNPGTGCJkdY,175840,177680,new recipes and generally comment on
QNPGTGCJkdY,177680,179680,your declining mental stability so are
QNPGTGCJkdY,179680,181920,they real or are they just figments of
QNPGTGCJkdY,181920,183760,your imagination even the player
QNPGTGCJkdY,183760,185360,character asks this question the first
QNPGTGCJkdY,185360,186800,time we encounter them in the game and
QNPGTGCJkdY,186800,189760,the answer is unclear at best no one
QNPGTGCJkdY,189760,191599,else seems to see them and when we begin
QNPGTGCJkdY,191599,192959,to pass out towards the end of the game
QNPGTGCJkdY,192959,194640,the characters seem to phase in and out
QNPGTGCJkdY,194640,196800,of existence feels pretty obvious that
QNPGTGCJkdY,196800,198800,we're just going mad right then again
QNPGTGCJkdY,198800,200800,they can also keep drawers shut slam
QNPGTGCJkdY,200800,202480,doors and have even made mouse holes to
QNPGTGCJkdY,202480,204560,travel unseen throughout the cabin plus
QNPGTGCJkdY,204560,206560,we're told potato blocks those same
QNPGTGCJkdY,206560,208799,mouse holes with rocks in new game plus
QNPGTGCJkdY,208799,210959,so they're not only able to move rocks
QNPGTGCJkdY,210959,212879,but also apparently can't pass through
QNPGTGCJkdY,212879,214720,them well the answer to what they really
QNPGTGCJkdY,214720,216560,are seems to come at the end of that new
QNPGTGCJkdY,216560,218799,game plus after killing an enraged karen
QNPGTGCJkdY,218799,220319,down in the basement we actually get a
QNPGTGCJkdY,220319,221840,little cut scene that shows her lying on
QNPGTGCJkdY,221840,224000,the ground eyes widening as she dies
QNPGTGCJkdY,224000,226000,only for it to then cut to the chompets
QNPGTGCJkdY,226000,228080,welcoming in a new vegetable turn up to
QNPGTGCJkdY,228080,229920,the group though this new champet is
QNPGTGCJkdY,229920,231920,labeled as a he the editing makes it
QNPGTGCJkdY,231920,234080,very clear that it's meant to be karen
QNPGTGCJkdY,234080,236400,but then why would she of all the people
QNPGTGCJkdY,236400,238560,become a chompet as opposed to everyone
QNPGTGCJkdY,238560,239920,else that we've seen die throughout the
QNPGTGCJkdY,239920,243120,game mariah gregor and anatoly all die
QNPGTGCJkdY,243120,244720,in the game but they only haunt the
QNPGTGCJkdY,244720,246720,cabin as spirits they don't form some
QNPGTGCJkdY,246720,248879,new food group meant to chase us around
QNPGTGCJkdY,248879,251280,so what's going on here well several
QNPGTGCJkdY,251280,252560,times throughout the game both the
QNPGTGCJkdY,252560,254239,spirits of our dead companions and the
QNPGTGCJkdY,254239,255920,chompettes make mention that quote those
QNPGTGCJkdY,255920,257840,who die in the cabin are bound by
QNPGTGCJkdY,257840,259919,different rules the rules are different
QNPGTGCJkdY,259919,261840,for people that die in the cabin the
QNPGTGCJkdY,261840,264240,lucky ones are dead when cooked the
QNPGTGCJkdY,264240,266960,important word here is in the cabin
QNPGTGCJkdY,266960,268800,earlier in the game mariah and anatoly
QNPGTGCJkdY,268800,270560,both leave the cabin in search of food
QNPGTGCJkdY,270560,272240,these moments are emphasized by a little
QNPGTGCJkdY,272240,274400,jingle and the explicit words character
QNPGTGCJkdY,274400,277280,has left the cabin pretty hard to deny
QNPGTGCJkdY,277280,279120,what's going on in those moments as for
QNPGTGCJkdY,279120,281440,gregor our third companion while yes he
QNPGTGCJkdY,281440,283600,does die inside the cabin it isn't by
QNPGTGCJkdY,283600,285919,our hand he's been cut to pieces by
QNPGTGCJkdY,285919,288240,karen mariah gregor and anatoly are
QNPGTGCJkdY,288240,290080,haunting the cabin because of our guilt
QNPGTGCJkdY,290080,292320,but karen died inside the cabin's
QNPGTGCJkdY,292320,294800,basement from stab wounds we inflict
QNPGTGCJkdY,294800,297199,which is why she then becomes a chompat
QNPGTGCJkdY,297199,299120,this in turn suggests that all the other
QNPGTGCJkdY,299120,300720,trumpets must function the same way
QNPGTGCJkdY,300720,302880,previous victims of the baba yaga also
QNPGTGCJkdY,302880,304320,murdered within the confines of the
QNPGTGCJkdY,304320,306000,cabin during the hide and seek section
QNPGTGCJkdY,306000,307440,of the story we find onion in the
QNPGTGCJkdY,307440,309280,bedroom and he tells us this i'm sorry
QNPGTGCJkdY,309280,310720,to hear about mariah and natalie and
QNPGTGCJkdY,310720,312880,gregor but yikes that's three people
QNPGTGCJkdY,312880,314800,gone in less than a month not as bad as
QNPGTGCJkdY,314800,317120,five people in one night though right
QNPGTGCJkdY,317120,320160,five deaths five chompets hmm pieces
QNPGTGCJkdY,320160,321759,seem like they're falling into place we
QNPGTGCJkdY,321759,323520,even get this line from onion during the
QNPGTGCJkdY,323520,325280,fight with karen in the basement just
QNPGTGCJkdY,325280,327120,finish this in one swift motion like
QNPGTGCJkdY,327120,329840,with potato we killed potato in one move
QNPGTGCJkdY,329840,331360,something that potato confirms during
QNPGTGCJkdY,331360,334160,his ending looting it from my corpse and
QNPGTGCJkdY,334160,336880,hiding it in a drawer murder and theft
QNPGTGCJkdY,336880,339919,in one day wait wait what his knife so
QNPGTGCJkdY,339919,341759,far we've seen cabbage refer to it as
QNPGTGCJkdY,341759,343600,our knife and we only ever asked karen
QNPGTGCJkdY,343600,345600,to give us back our knife but it was
QNPGTGCJkdY,345600,348560,originally potatoes this is where things
QNPGTGCJkdY,348560,350160,really start to get interesting i
QNPGTGCJkdY,350160,352240,mentioned last time how potato really is
QNPGTGCJkdY,352240,353919,the oddball of the group while all the
QNPGTGCJkdY,353919,355120,rest are willing to play along with
QNPGTGCJkdY,355120,357440,cabbage's games potato regularly stays
QNPGTGCJkdY,357440,359360,silent or else kills the moment with an
QNPGTGCJkdY,359360,361360,offhanded comment bringing everyone
QNPGTGCJkdY,361360,363440,crashing back down to reality in one of
QNPGTGCJkdY,363440,365199,the game's many endings he says that you
QNPGTGCJkdY,365199,367120,should both leave the cabin to feast on
QNPGTGCJkdY,367120,369199,all the people of local towns together
QNPGTGCJkdY,369199,371039,he also is the one that gives us the
QNPGTGCJkdY,371039,373680,slaughter stew recipe the only outright
QNPGTGCJkdY,373680,375759,cannibalistic recipe in the game on top
QNPGTGCJkdY,375759,377759,of all of it during one of his survival
QNPGTGCJkdY,377759,379759,lessons is an in-depth analysis of the
QNPGTGCJkdY,379759,381440,harris benedict equation which
QNPGTGCJkdY,381440,383600,calculates how people starve to death
QNPGTGCJkdY,383600,385360,you know a totally normal not serial
QNPGTGCJkdY,385360,387360,killery thing to do at all and if none
QNPGTGCJkdY,387360,389280,of that was explicit enough potato even
QNPGTGCJkdY,389280,391360,says i wouldn't miss a killing for the
QNPGTGCJkdY,391360,394880,world this was his cabin potato was the
QNPGTGCJkdY,394880,397360,baba yaga before us remember those notes
QNPGTGCJkdY,397360,398479,that i've been mentioning from around
QNPGTGCJkdY,398479,400319,the cabin the ones that you can only get
QNPGTGCJkdY,400319,402160,on certain days in certain places after
QNPGTGCJkdY,402160,403840,multiple clicks well the last note we
QNPGTGCJkdY,403840,407680,get tells us this june 26 1862 another
QNPGTGCJkdY,407680,409520,body of a child was discovered within
QNPGTGCJkdY,409520,411680,the city of zakopane with the remains
QNPGTGCJkdY,411680,413840,stuffed into a barrel full of potatoes
QNPGTGCJkdY,413840,415759,this marks the fourth victim by the
QNPGTGCJkdY,415759,418000,butcher of zakopane in less than a month
QNPGTGCJkdY,418000,420400,potatoes you say
QNPGTGCJkdY,420400,421919,that's not the only connection to our
QNPGTGCJkdY,421919,423520,good friend potato either during the
QNPGTGCJkdY,423520,425360,chomp at cooking courses another post
QNPGTGCJkdY,425360,426880,game mode made available after you get
QNPGTGCJkdY,426880,428400,your first ending while the others are
QNPGTGCJkdY,428400,430319,reminiscing about school potato tells us
QNPGTGCJkdY,430319,431919,that he dropped out of grade school so
QNPGTGCJkdY,431919,433840,he could work at the butcher to which
QNPGTGCJkdY,433840,436400,bread replies explains everything so far
QNPGTGCJkdY,436400,438880,potato was the butcher of zakopane as
QNPGTGCJkdY,438880,440720,onion says i wouldn't call it a change
QNPGTGCJkdY,440720,442720,of heart because it never really had one
QNPGTGCJkdY,442720,444800,potato and we know we can't be the
QNPGTGCJkdY,444800,446319,butcher based on another of the hidden
QNPGTGCJkdY,446319,447680,notes inside of the game we know the
QNPGTGCJkdY,447680,449520,butcher was at one point summoned to
QNPGTGCJkdY,449520,451680,court but as potato himself says it's a
QNPGTGCJkdY,451680,453759,shame you never went to trial for
QNPGTGCJkdY,453759,456080,anything but then who are we how did we
QNPGTGCJkdY,456080,457840,get involved in all this well we were
QNPGTGCJkdY,457840,459599,part of the original group of kids that
QNPGTGCJkdY,459599,461440,become the chomp bets during the final
QNPGTGCJkdY,461440,463520,fight bread asks us a very interesting
QNPGTGCJkdY,463520,465360,question during our fight with karen why
QNPGTGCJkdY,465360,467280,did we come here again
QNPGTGCJkdY,467280,469360,so that explains potato notice the use
QNPGTGCJkdY,469360,471599,of the word we we were a part of the
QNPGTGCJkdY,471599,473599,group with bread at some point potato
QNPGTGCJkdY,473599,475440,meanwhile was an outsider in the
QNPGTGCJkdY,475440,477199,appetizer preview edition of this game
QNPGTGCJkdY,477199,478960,you and potato have a heart to heart and
QNPGTGCJkdY,478960,481280,he outright tells us this i cornered the
QNPGTGCJkdY,481280,484400,four in this basement room and all of us
QNPGTGCJkdY,484400,488400,ended up dead cabbage onion raspberry
QNPGTGCJkdY,488400,490319,bread they're still afraid to enter this
QNPGTGCJkdY,490319,492879,room traumatize to come to grips with it
QNPGTGCJkdY,492879,495199,potato as the butcher was about to kill
QNPGTGCJkdY,495199,497120,everyone and you see that's when you
QNPGTGCJkdY,497120,498879,step in in the main game we have an
QNPGTGCJkdY,498879,500479,opportunity to tell karen about the
QNPGTGCJkdY,500479,502800,chompets and when we do this is her
QNPGTGCJkdY,502800,506319,response a potato is killing people they
QNPGTGCJkdY,506319,508560,asked you to save them what the heck
QNPGTGCJkdY,508560,510800,does that even mean in short we killed
QNPGTGCJkdY,510800,512399,the butcher of zakopani with his own
QNPGTGCJkdY,512399,514159,knife as he was killing our friends and
QNPGTGCJkdY,514159,516800,in so doing we got possessed and became
QNPGTGCJkdY,516800,519919,the baba yaga but how for some reason we
QNPGTGCJkdY,519919,521360,weren't gathered into the basement like
QNPGTGCJkdY,521360,523279,the others we had the chance to kill the
QNPGTGCJkdY,523279,524959,butcher when all the rest of our friends
QNPGTGCJkdY,524959,527440,were helpless so what made us so
QNPGTGCJkdY,527440,529200,different well i suspect that the
QNPGTGCJkdY,529200,531040,butcher was training us to become like
QNPGTGCJkdY,531040,532560,him throughout the game we act as
QNPGTGCJkdY,532560,534160,karen's mentor introducing her to the
QNPGTGCJkdY,534160,536080,world of killing and cannibalism we show
QNPGTGCJkdY,536080,537600,her books about chopping people up and
QNPGTGCJkdY,537600,539920,we get lines like she's not ready yet
QNPGTGCJkdY,539920,542000,she is meant to become our cooking
QNPGTGCJkdY,542000,543600,companion at least until she gets a
QNPGTGCJkdY,543600,545760,little bit too enthusiastic and turns on
QNPGTGCJkdY,545760,548080,us and i suspect that the butcher was
QNPGTGCJkdY,548080,550160,training us up in a similar way in our
QNPGTGCJkdY,550160,551920,various conversations with potato there
QNPGTGCJkdY,551920,553360,seems to be some level of friendship
QNPGTGCJkdY,553360,555440,between our character and the killer he
QNPGTGCJkdY,555440,557279,asks us to go into the basement and put
QNPGTGCJkdY,557279,560560,an end to this not for the chompets for
QNPGTGCJkdY,560560,562399,me we also get hints throughout new game
QNPGTGCJkdY,562399,564240,plus timeline that karen and potato
QNPGTGCJkdY,564240,566000,would have made great partners in
QNPGTGCJkdY,566000,567839,another life out of all of the kids that
QNPGTGCJkdY,567839,569839,he planned to kill we were singled out
QNPGTGCJkdY,569839,571920,as special we were meant to be his pupil
QNPGTGCJkdY,571920,573680,as you might imagine being a one-man
QNPGTGCJkdY,573680,575360,cannibal is a lonely life getting to
QNPGTGCJkdY,575360,576640,share that with someone else though
QNPGTGCJkdY,576640,578640,priceless but when our friends started
QNPGTGCJkdY,578640,580320,getting killed we had to act and
QNPGTGCJkdY,580320,582000,slaughter the man who had taken us under
QNPGTGCJkdY,582000,584000,his wing except what we didn't know is
QNPGTGCJkdY,584000,585760,that that would force us to go on and
QNPGTGCJkdY,585760,587920,continue the baba yaga's legacy moving
QNPGTGCJkdY,587920,589839,forward so there you have it the deep
QNPGTGCJkdY,589839,592080,lore of cooking companions except
QNPGTGCJkdY,592080,594720,there's one final layer to the story one
QNPGTGCJkdY,594720,597040,final chompet that we need to discuss
QNPGTGCJkdY,597040,598640,cornbread as i mentioned before
QNPGTGCJkdY,598640,600720,cornbread is the missing sixth chump at
QNPGTGCJkdY,600720,602160,one that we hear mentioned a lot but
QNPGTGCJkdY,602160,604000,never really see until the game's final
QNPGTGCJkdY,604000,606160,most secret ending we know from in-game
QNPGTGCJkdY,606160,607839,clues that cornbread's real name was
QNPGTGCJkdY,607839,609519,raziel and that they were related to
QNPGTGCJkdY,609519,611760,onion being a chompet we also know that
QNPGTGCJkdY,611760,613360,presumably they were killed in the cabin
QNPGTGCJkdY,613360,615360,and that we consumed their body but
QNPGTGCJkdY,615360,617120,there's something that makes cornbread
QNPGTGCJkdY,617120,619200,different unlike all the other chompets
QNPGTGCJkdY,619200,621519,we've let cornbread move on during the
QNPGTGCJkdY,621519,623680,end game of new game plus cabbage asks
QNPGTGCJkdY,623680,625600,us if we'll let the chompets go and we
QNPGTGCJkdY,625600,629200,say no will you let us go
QNPGTGCJkdY,629200,630959,someday maybe in it for some reason
QNPGTGCJkdY,630959,633200,we've allowed cornbread to pass on why
QNPGTGCJkdY,633200,634720,well we know at some point that we've
QNPGTGCJkdY,634720,636720,actually stopped killing during the post
QNPGTGCJkdY,636720,639360,game potato asks us this how many
QNPGTGCJkdY,639360,641839,generations died brutally at your hands
QNPGTGCJkdY,641839,644079,before you gave up was it your arthritis
QNPGTGCJkdY,644079,646640,that stopped you or did you eventually
QNPGTGCJkdY,646640,649200,feel remorse i think it was the latter i
QNPGTGCJkdY,649200,651200,think that we felt remorse and it was
QNPGTGCJkdY,651200,653200,cornbread that did it to us now to be
QNPGTGCJkdY,653200,655040,honest based on this message that i
QNPGTGCJkdY,655040,656720,found on discord i'm not even sure the
QNPGTGCJkdY,656720,658000,creators of the game have fully mapped
QNPGTGCJkdY,658000,659680,this out but based on everything that
QNPGTGCJkdY,659680,661120,i've seen inside the game and everything
QNPGTGCJkdY,661120,662800,that we covered so far here's what i
QNPGTGCJkdY,662800,664480,think happened after the night where our
QNPGTGCJkdY,664480,666240,friends die and we killed a butcher we
QNPGTGCJkdY,666240,668160,become possessed by the baba yaga some
QNPGTGCJkdY,668160,670320,time passes we're still in the cabin
QNPGTGCJkdY,670320,672880,alone and hungry but then a new child
QNPGTGCJkdY,672880,675120,stumbles in someone we know it's onion's
QNPGTGCJkdY,675120,677120,relative raziel looking for his lost
QNPGTGCJkdY,677120,678959,family member we bring them in and they
QNPGTGCJkdY,678959,680720,stay for a while telling us countless
QNPGTGCJkdY,680720,682640,puns just generally being fun and
QNPGTGCJkdY,682640,684560,bringing joy to our otherwise lonely
QNPGTGCJkdY,684560,686720,life raziel gives us hope shows us that
QNPGTGCJkdY,686720,688480,there's no need for us to kill that we
QNPGTGCJkdY,688480,690880,can become normal again but eventually
QNPGTGCJkdY,690880,693120,the hunger sets in it can't be quelled
QNPGTGCJkdY,693120,695680,it can't be stopped we resist it but at
QNPGTGCJkdY,695680,697920,some point we succumb to the baba yaga's
QNPGTGCJkdY,697920,700320,need we kill raziel in a moment of
QNPGTGCJkdY,700320,702240,weakness he wasn't meant to be there he
QNPGTGCJkdY,702240,704160,wasn't meant to die we just couldn't
QNPGTGCJkdY,704160,706000,help ourselves out of regret and out of
QNPGTGCJkdY,706000,708160,self-loathing we eat him we eat every
QNPGTGCJkdY,708160,710160,last piece of him and then we let him go
QNPGTGCJkdY,710160,711519,because he was innocent because he
QNPGTGCJkdY,711519,713360,reminds us of our weakness because we
QNPGTGCJkdY,713360,715279,can't bear to keep him a prisoner we let
QNPGTGCJkdY,715279,717120,him move on and we keep all the other
QNPGTGCJkdY,717120,719519,chompets here with us too afraid to be
QNPGTGCJkdY,719519,721120,left alone we keep the rest of the
QNPGTGCJkdY,721120,722880,chompets here because they don't come
QNPGTGCJkdY,722880,725040,with the extra burden of guilt and so
QNPGTGCJkdY,725040,726959,there you have oh the developer just
QNPGTGCJkdY,726959,728480,tagged us in a tweet wonder what this is
QNPGTGCJkdY,728480,729200,about
QNPGTGCJkdY,729200,731040,a black image you know what that means
QNPGTGCJkdY,731040,733680,crank up the exposure boys a shadowy
QNPGTGCJkdY,733680,735920,figure holding a knife with four people
QNPGTGCJkdY,735920,739040,cabbage raspberry onion bread and the
QNPGTGCJkdY,739040,741600,shadow of potato beautiful chef's kiss
QNPGTGCJkdY,741600,743680,now all we need is that cornbread origin
QNPGTGCJkdY,743680,745519,story and we're all good and with that
QNPGTGCJkdY,745519,746959,my friends we put a wrap on the
QNPGTGCJkdY,746959,749200,delicious lore of cooking companions so
QNPGTGCJkdY,749200,750560,remember the next time you're at the
QNPGTGCJkdY,750560,751920,store and the vegetables start talking
QNPGTGCJkdY,751920,753600,to you don't just tune them out give a
QNPGTGCJkdY,753600,755600,listen you might just have made your new
QNPGTGCJkdY,755600,758079,best friend and eventually a salad but
QNPGTGCJkdY,758079,762480,hey that's just a theory a game theory
QNPGTGCJkdY,762480,766120,thanks for watching
QNPGTGCJkdY,768090,783600,[Music]
QNPGTGCJkdY,783600,785680,you
