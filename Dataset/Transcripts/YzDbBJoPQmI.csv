YzDbBJoPQmI,500,11211,MATTER WHAT THEIR SPIN AND WHAT   THEIR TALKING POINTS  ARE.  >>> THIS MORNING AS THE SUPREME 
YzDbBJoPQmI,11211,19985,"COURT DECISION  SINKS   IN, A LOOK AT THE RIGHT."
YzDbBJoPQmI,19985,25892,"BY A LARGE MARGIN, SOME 20  POINTS, AMERICANS BELIEVE   REPEALING ABORTION RIGHTS IS A"
YzDbBJoPQmI,25892,31264,STEP BACKWARDS FOR  THE COUNTRY RATHER THAN A STEP  FORWARD.  THIS SAME POLL SHOWS THAT WOMEN 
YzDbBJoPQmI,31264,44911,IN AMERICA BELIEVE  THIS RULING WILL MAKE THEIR   LIVES WORSE INSTEAD OF  BETTER BY MORE THAN A 3-1 
YzDbBJoPQmI,44911,50517,DIFFERENCE  YOU'VE BEEN GETTING REACTION  ALL WEEKEND.  YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE IN FRONT
YzDbBJoPQmI,50517,56789,OF THE SUPREME COURT.   TELL US WHAT YOU'VE BEEN  HEARING.  >> Reporter: I WAS STANDING IN  THIS SAME SPOT WHEN 
YzDbBJoPQmI,56789,62929,"THE DECISION CAME DOWN.   AT THE TIME ON FRIDAY, WE SAW   EQUAL GROUPS IN TERMS   OF THOSE THAT SUPPORTED THE   RIGHT TO ABORTION AND "
YzDbBJoPQmI,62929,70170,"THOSE THAT OPPOSED IT.  OVER THE WEEKEND, THE CROWDS WE   SAW GATHER AROUND   THE SUPREME COURT WERE IN LINE"
YzDbBJoPQmI,70170,75541,"WITH THAT POLL.   A MAJORITY OF THEM WERE   FRUSTRATED, UPSET, CRYING   BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T HAPPY WITH "
YzDbBJoPQmI,75541,81080,"THE DECISION THE  SUPREME COURT MADE.   I MET ONE WOMAN, HEIDI, THAT  FLEW UP FROM FLORIDA"
YzDbBJoPQmI,81080,86785,ONCE SHE SAW THE DECISION COME  DOWN.   SHE FELT SHE HAD TO BE HERE.  I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO SOME OF 
YzDbBJoPQmI,86785,93793,OUR CONVERSATION  AROUND HOW SHE THINKS THIS IS 
YzDbBJoPQmI,93793,103303,"IMPACTING OUR RIGHTS  ? I SAID TO PEOPLE AROUND ME, "
YzDbBJoPQmI,103303,111110,RIGHTS ARE FADING   ALSO.   THAT'S HOW MOST OF US FEEL. 
YzDbBJoPQmI,111110,117116,>> I MET NORA WHO WAS   DISTRAUGHT TO THINK ABOUT THE   FACT SHE'LL BRING HER DAUGHTER  INTO THIS WORLD WITH
YzDbBJoPQmI,117116,122688,LESS RIGHTS THAN SHE HAS A  MOTHER HAD WHEN SHE WAS   CONCEIVED.  SHE MADE THE POINT WE WANT TO 
YzDbBJoPQmI,122688,129328,VOTE IN NOVEMBER AND  HOLD OUR LAWMAKERS ACCOUNTABLE.   SHE AND OTHERS SAID THERE'S A 
YzDbBJoPQmI,129328,137570,"SENSE OF FRUSTRATION.   THEY VOTED FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN,   SENATORS AND  LAWMAKERS IN CONGRESS RIGHT   NOW.  THEY WANT TO SEE ACTION TAKEN "
YzDbBJoPQmI,137570,144611,NOW BEFORE NOVEMBER.  SAVANNAH?   >> THE DECISION TO OVERTURN ROE   V WADE IS IMPACTING   PEOPLE'S OUTLOOK ON OTHER 
YzDbBJoPQmI,144611,150216,RIGHTS PROTECTED THROUGH  PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT RULINGS  LIKE SAME-SEX 
YzDbBJoPQmI,150216,156389,"MARRIAGE, ACCESS TO   CONTRACEPTIVES, THINGS FROM   JUSTICE THOMAS WRITTEN.   WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT"
YzDbBJoPQmI,156389,162228,THAT?   WHAT ARE PEOPLE THINKING?   >> RIGHT.   THIS WAS SOMETHING SUGGESTED IN   THE OPINION THAT  JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS WROTE 
YzDbBJoPQmI,162228,169736,IN THE DECISION THAT  CAME DOWN ON FRIDAY.  IT WAS ESPECIALLY POIGNANT  YESTERDAY ON THE  ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY THE
YzDbBJoPQmI,169736,174907,SUPREME COURT HAD   LEGALIZED GAY MARRIAGE GIVING   THAT RIGHT TO PEOPLE  LOOKING FOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
YzDbBJoPQmI,174907,180079,THAT'S SOMETHING NOW PEOPLE ARE   SEEING IS ON THE  LINE.   I SPOKE TO TWO YOUNGER WOMEN  THAT EXPRESSED THE
YzDbBJoPQmI,180079,185285,QUESTION MARK THAT FOLLOWS ALL
YzDbBJoPQmI,185285,190556,OF THIS.  >> IC ITS CONCERNING.   COULD HAVE GAY MARRIAGE TAKEN 
YzDbBJoPQmI,190556,199832,"AWAY AS WELL.   WE HAVE HAD THIS FOR 50 YEARS   AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE  CAN'T HAVE ABORTION ANYMORE,"
YzDbBJoPQmI,199832,205138,MAKE OUR OWN RIGHTS.  I THINK WE SHOULD BE WORRIED. 
YzDbBJoPQmI,205138,210209,WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT?  >> THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE   HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN. 
YzDbBJoPQmI,210209,215682,EXPERTS POINT OUT THERE'S A   DIFFERENCE BECAUSE ROE V  WADE INVOLVES THE LIFE OF A 
YzDbBJoPQmI,215682,222822,CHILD WHERE SAME-SEX  MARRIAGE AND CONTRACEPTION MAY  RIDE THE LINE   DIFFERENTLY.  THIS IS WHAT SOME ARE CONCERNED 
YzDbBJoPQmI,222822,228194,ABOUT BECAUSE IN  SOME CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE   HEARINGS WHEN THEY WERE   GETTING APPOINTED LIKE
YzDbBJoPQmI,228194,233232,"KAVANAUGH AND BARRETT, THEY   RESPECTED THE PRECEDENT OF ROE  V WADE. "
YzDbBJoPQmI,233232,238971,THEY'RE WONDERING IF THEY'LL  RESPECT THE PRESS DEBIT   OF OTHER CASES.   >> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT STATES 
YzDbBJoPQmI,238971,245111,WITH TRIGGER LAWS   BANNING ABORTION ACCESS.  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR   ABORTION IN THOSE STATES?   >> IT'S GOING TO BE A CASE BY 
YzDbBJoPQmI,245111,251117,"CASE, STATE BY STATE  BASIS.  SOME OF THESE STATES ACROSS THE   COUNTRY HAD A 30 DAY"
YzDbBJoPQmI,251117,257989,MARKER IF AND WHEN ROE V WADE   WAS OVERTURNED OR SOME  PART WAS OVERTURNED.  SOME HAVE A 30 DAY WAITING
YzDbBJoPQmI,257989,263996,"PERIOD UNTIL THAT GETS  OVERTURNED.   OTHERS, THE GOVERNOR NEEDED TO  SIGN THE ABORTION BAN "
YzDbBJoPQmI,263996,269902,"INTO EFFECT ESSENTIALLY.  WE SAW THAT HAPPEN FRIDAY   AFTERNOON WITH MISSOURI.  YOU LOOK AT IT, THERE'S LIMITED "
YzDbBJoPQmI,269902,275141,"EXCEPTIONS FOR WHEN   WOMEN CAN'T GET AN ABORTION.  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S NO   EXCEPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO "
YzDbBJoPQmI,275141,281681,INCIDENTS OF RAIN OR INCEST.  ABORTIONS ARE ONLY ALLOWED IN   THE CASE WHERE THE  MOTHER'S LIFE IS AT RISK. 
YzDbBJoPQmI,281681,288154,WE SEE STATES LIKE ILLINOIS   SURROUNDED BY STATES  THAT HAVE INDICATED THEY PLAN 
YzDbBJoPQmI,288154,294293,ON PASSING ABORTION   BAN.  THEY'RE RAMPING UP THEIR  RESOURCES.  THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THEY'RE  WORKING TO PROTECT  THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO CROSS 
YzDbBJoPQmI,294293,299732,STATE LINES SO WOMEN  CAN GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY  NEED.   SAVANNAH?   >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
YzDbBJoPQmI,299732,304937,>>> THE END OF ROE V WADE   CLEARS THE PATH FOR STATES  TO CRIMINALIZE AND PROSECUTE
YzDbBJoPQmI,304937,310810,PEOPLE THAT RECEIVED OR   PROVIDE ABORTIONS.  JOINING US NOW IS PRESIDENT OF
YzDbBJoPQmI,310810,317049,"AMERICAN BRIDGE, THE  DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL ACTION   COMMITTEE.  JESSICA, GOOD MORNING.  THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. "
YzDbBJoPQmI,317049,323856,THE RULING TURNS ABORTION INTO  AN ISSUE DECIDED ON   THE STATE LEVEL.  WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU FOR 
YzDbBJoPQmI,323856,330563,ABORTION RIGHTS?  WHAT ACTIONS ARE YOU TAKING?  >> GOOD MORNING.  THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE.
YzDbBJoPQmI,330563,337403,IT IS AN INCREDIBLY DARK  MORNING TO WAKE UP ON THE   FIRST WEEK THAT WE HAVE LOST
YzDbBJoPQmI,337403,343609,THESE RIGHTS.   WHAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING   AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE
YzDbBJoPQmI,343609,349348,STATES MAKING ACTIVE MOVES TO   TAKE ADVANTAGE OF   THIS.   REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS EVERYWHERE 
YzDbBJoPQmI,349348,354487,SAYING THIS ISN'T   THE END WHETHER NATIONAL  ABORTION BAN OR MOVING TO 
YzDbBJoPQmI,354487,362295,EVEN MORE LAWS IN VARIOUS   STATES.   SO I THINK THE NUMBER ONE THING   IS THIS ISN'T OVER.   WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT. 
YzDbBJoPQmI,362295,369569,THERE'S A BALLOT INITIATIVE IN  KANSAS THAT IS  CURRENTLY ON THE BALLOT AND   WILL BE VOTED ON BEFORE 
YzDbBJoPQmI,369569,375808,NOVEMBER.   SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STEPS  WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND   ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER OR
YzDbBJoPQmI,375808,381347,EASIER FOR WOMEN TO   ACCESS CARE.  THERE'S ALSO AN ENTIRE NET WORK 
YzDbBJoPQmI,381347,389088,OF CAREGIVERS AND   ABORTION FUNDS THAT ARE   PREPARED TO HELP WOMEN AND
YzDbBJoPQmI,389088,396629,OTHER PATIENTS WHO NEED   ABORTION CARE AND HEALTH  CARE.   THAT SUPPORTING THEM IN THIS
YzDbBJoPQmI,396629,404770,MOMENT IS INCREDIBLY  IMPORTANT.  >> THIS DECISION COMES AT THIS  REALLY SPECIFIC TIME.   IT'S THE END OF A SUPREME COURT 
YzDbBJoPQmI,404770,410242,"TERM.   JUST AHEAD OF PIVOTAL MIDTERM   ELECTIONS.  AGAIN, THIS IS NOW AN ISSUE   THAT GOES TO THE STATES."
YzDbBJoPQmI,410242,416482,YOU REPRESENT A DEMOCRATIC  POLITICAL ACTION  COMMITTEE.  DOES THIS SHOW FORCE BY THE 
YzDbBJoPQmI,416482,421821,HIGH COURT CONSERVATIVE   MAJORITY DEMOCRAT STRATEGY FOR  THE CYCLE?  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN HEADING 
YzDbBJoPQmI,421821,427026,INTO MIDTERMS?  >> IT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD.  WHEN WE POLLED IN THE FALL
YzDbBJoPQmI,427026,433766,"RIGHT AFTER TEXAS HAD ITS   BAN GOING INTO EFFECT, ONLY   ABOUT 33% OF VOTERS THAT"
YzDbBJoPQmI,433766,443275,WE TALKED TO THOUGHT THAT ROE V   WADE COULD BE   OVERTURNED OR WOULD BE OVER 
YzDbBJoPQmI,443275,451484,TURNED.   >> I MET WITH TWO-THIRDS OF THE   POPULATION THAT   THOUGHT THIS WASN'T GOING TO
YzDbBJoPQmI,451484,457089,HAPPEN.   THIS IS REALLY UNPRECEDENTED  TERRITORY.  THIS IS NOT A DIVISIVE ISSUE
YzDbBJoPQmI,457089,469902,"FOR MOST AMERICANS.   MOST AMERICANS, EITHER SEVEN OR   EIGHT OUT OF TEN  BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A "
YzDbBJoPQmI,469902,476408,CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO   ABORTION.   TWO-THIRDS OF PEOPLE WAKING UP  COME FRIDAY AND   SATURDAY SAYING THIS IS   SOMETHING I THOUGHT WAS 
YzDbBJoPQmI,476408,482848,ENSHRINED.  I UNDERSTOOD TO BE A RIGHT WE   HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY
YzDbBJoPQmI,482848,492058,ALMOST 50 YEARS.  I THINK REALLY TALKING TO THEM  ABOUT THE FACT THIS   IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
YzDbBJoPQmI,492058,498598,OVERNIGHT.  THIS IS NOT AN UNELECTED BODY   OF JUDGES THAT DID  THIS.   THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
YzDbBJoPQmI,498598,506372,"THAT MADE THIS HAPPEN.  WE'RE SEEING CANDIDATES FROM  AROUND THE COUNTRY.   HERE AT AMERICAN BRIDGE, WE   LAUNCHED A WEBSITE THAT "
YzDbBJoPQmI,506372,514245,IS A RESOURCE FOR ANYONE THAT   WANTS TO UNDERSTAND   WHERE POLITICIANS STAND ON THIS 
YzDbBJoPQmI,514245,519385,"ISSUE.  OVER THE WEEKEND, WE UPDATED"
YzDbBJoPQmI,519385,531297,THAT WEBSITE WITH 30  DIFFERENT STATE LEGISLATIVE   CANDIDATES IN ARIZONA   ALONE THAT WANT TO RESTRICT 
YzDbBJoPQmI,531297,536668,ABORTION CARE.  IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT STATES  YOU'RE FOCUSED ON?
YzDbBJoPQmI,536668,542207,>> I FOCUS ON GOVERNOR RACES  LIKE PENNSYLVANIA WHERE   DOUG WANTS TO BAN ABORTION. 
YzDbBJoPQmI,542207,550750,THAT'S WILDLY OUT OF STEP WITH  RIGHTS THE PEOPLE OF  THAT COMMON WEATHER WANT AND
YzDbBJoPQmI,550750,555955,"DESERVE.  THE ENTIRE BATTLEFIELD THIS,  THIS IS AN ISSUE OF   FREEDOM, SOMETHING FROM PEOPLE"
YzDbBJoPQmI,555955,561927,FROM ACROSS THE   POLITICAL SPECTRUM WANT IN  PLACE.  I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO
YzDbBJoPQmI,561927,570403,"SAY WHAT HAPPENED,  HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT WOMEN,   FAMILIES, PROVIDERS,"
YzDbBJoPQmI,570403,577843,THEIR LOVED ONES.   THEIR ABOUT TO DECIDE THEIR OWN   FUTURE AND THEN WE  HAVE TO REMIND THEM WHO REALLY
YzDbBJoPQmI,577843,583082,IS TO BLAME HERE.   s IT'S THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.  >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.   FOR ANOTHER VIEW ON THIS

YzDbBJoPQmI,601100,607373,RULING?   >> THE ROOM ERUPTED IN CHEERS.  WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR 50 YEARS 
YzDbBJoPQmI,607373,613813,TO PROTECT UNBORN   CHILDREN.   THERE'S NO HINT IN THE  CONSTITUTION THAT THERE'S A   RIGHT TO KILL UNBORN CHILDREN.
YzDbBJoPQmI,613813,619017,THE STATES PRIOR TO 1973  OVERWHELMINGLY STILL  PROTECTED UNBORN CHILDREN.
YzDbBJoPQmI,619017,624090,THE SUPREME COURT RIGHTLY   DECIDED THAT ROE V WADE   WAS AN EGREGIOUS ERROR
YzDbBJoPQmI,624090,631530,OVERTURNED.   WE NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO  PROTECT INNOCENT

YzDbBJoPQmI,668701,674673,IN VULNERABLE   SITUATIONS?   WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THERE?  >> THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT HAS

YzDbBJoPQmI,760492,770569,WE CAN TO SAY THEY  HAVE TO GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT  POSSIBLE  COMPLICATIONS TO ABORTION OR

YzDbBJoPQmI,791857,796962,WE WANT TO GET OUT  THERE TO WOMEN WHO ARE  CONSIDERING ABORTION. 
YzDbBJoPQmI,796962,802434,THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO BE  --    IT IS NOT THEIR ONLY

YzDbBJoPQmI,856588,862227,EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION.  THE POWER OF AN INDIVIDUAL  STATE TO CRIMINALIZE  ACTIVITY THAT HAPPENS OFF

YzDbBJoPQmI,886952,892891,HAPPEN WITHIN STATE   BOUNDARIES?   THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THE NEXT   BATTLE IN THIS
