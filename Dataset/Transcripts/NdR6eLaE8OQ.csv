NdR6eLaE8OQ,38079,40000,lift during photo shoots and red carpet
NdR6eLaE8OQ,40000,41760,events but she totally could have fooled
NdR6eLaE8OQ,41760,43840,us she loves it so much that she even
NdR6eLaE8OQ,43840,46079,launched her own line of tonal body tape
NdR6eLaE8OQ,46079,48239,and pasties through her brand skims
NdR6eLaE8OQ,48239,50640,facelift tape ever wonder how some
NdR6eLaE8OQ,50640,52640,celebrities can seamlessly change
NdR6eLaE8OQ,52640,54719,aspects of their face or eye shape yes
NdR6eLaE8OQ,54719,56320,of course you can do this with makeup
NdR6eLaE8OQ,56320,58480,and contouring but you could also go
NdR6eLaE8OQ,58480,60480,lady gaga's route of doing things and
NdR6eLaE8OQ,60480,63359,just use facelift tape in 2014 the house
NdR6eLaE8OQ,63359,65439,of gucci star told the daily mirror that
NdR6eLaE8OQ,65439,67119,she uses the tape to pull back her
NdR6eLaE8OQ,67119,69200,cheekbones and to change her eye shape
NdR6eLaE8OQ,69200,71360,she stated when i have my wig cap on and
NdR6eLaE8OQ,71360,73040,i'm taping my face it's a sort of
NdR6eLaE8OQ,73040,75360,meditation for me in all honesty gaga's
NdR6eLaE8OQ,75360,77439,gorgeous with or without makeup but when
NdR6eLaE8OQ,77439,79200,she does decide to do a full face of
NdR6eLaE8OQ,79200,81520,glam the woman does not play around
NdR6eLaE8OQ,81520,83600,needle and thread yes you heard that
NdR6eLaE8OQ,83600,85759,right while a lot of celebrities opt to
NdR6eLaE8OQ,85759,88000,wear outfits that only require a zipper
NdR6eLaE8OQ,88000,90240,or other simple materials to fit into
NdR6eLaE8OQ,90240,92560,other celebs choose skin-tight outfits
NdR6eLaE8OQ,92560,94880,that they literally have to be sewn into
NdR6eLaE8OQ,94880,97200,don't believe us just ask kylie jenner
NdR6eLaE8OQ,97200,99439,she wore a gorgeous jean-paul gautier
NdR6eLaE8OQ,99439,101920,dress to the 72nd annual parsons benefit
NdR6eLaE8OQ,101920,104479,in 2021 but the dress required some
NdR6eLaE8OQ,104479,106479,extra maintenance to be fair her dress
NdR6eLaE8OQ,106479,108479,did in fact come with a zipper but it
NdR6eLaE8OQ,108479,110079,wouldn't sip over her chest and mid
NdR6eLaE8OQ,110079,112079,torso at that point someone with a
NdR6eLaE8OQ,112079,114159,needle thread and what we're assuming
NdR6eLaE8OQ,114159,116560,was an incredibly steady hand was called
NdR6eLaE8OQ,116560,118719,in to close up the rest of the dress
NdR6eLaE8OQ,118719,121439,socks okay hear us out while wearing
NdR6eLaE8OQ,121439,123439,socks may just seem like an everyday
NdR6eLaE8OQ,123439,125680,thing and it is they can definitely come
NdR6eLaE8OQ,125680,127680,in handy on the red carpet sometimes
NdR6eLaE8OQ,127680,129679,curating all the fashion pieces for an
NdR6eLaE8OQ,129679,131920,entire ensemble especially when it comes
NdR6eLaE8OQ,131920,134000,to deciding what shoes to wear can be a
NdR6eLaE8OQ,134000,136400,hassle and other times the hemline of a
NdR6eLaE8OQ,136400,138239,dress is cut a certain way and there's
NdR6eLaE8OQ,138239,140000,just nothing else that can be done and
NdR6eLaE8OQ,140000,142640,in early 2022 zendaya showed us that
NdR6eLaE8OQ,142640,144560,that's just the case sometimes during
NdR6eLaE8OQ,144560,146879,the euphoria season 2 photo call she
NdR6eLaE8OQ,146879,149040,shared a video to her instagram story of
NdR6eLaE8OQ,149040,150959,herself in a long black and white gown
NdR6eLaE8OQ,150959,153200,complete with white socks she
NdR6eLaE8OQ,153200,155360,hilariously captioned the video when you
NdR6eLaE8OQ,155360,157280,don't have room to let the hem down how
NdR6eLaE8OQ,157280,159200,would they know i mean she coulda had us
NdR6eLaE8OQ,159200,161280,fooled because the photos came out great
NdR6eLaE8OQ,161280,163200,then again leave it to zendaya to
NdR6eLaE8OQ,163200,165519,completely shut down a red carpet moment
NdR6eLaE8OQ,165519,167519,only to reveal that she was only wearing
NdR6eLaE8OQ,167519,170400,socks the entire time shoe lifts
NdR6eLaE8OQ,170400,172480,while zendaya may have opted for no
NdR6eLaE8OQ,172480,174080,shoes at all during one of her red
NdR6eLaE8OQ,174080,176640,carpet moments her beau tom holland opts
NdR6eLaE8OQ,176640,178720,for a little extra push in the shoes he
NdR6eLaE8OQ,178720,180720,wears when he's on the red carpet tom
NdR6eLaE8OQ,180720,183040,stands at about 5 8 and while no one
NdR6eLaE8OQ,183040,184640,should be made to feel bad about their
NdR6eLaE8OQ,184640,186239,height he's expressed his past
NdR6eLaE8OQ,186239,188480,insecurities about it but there are also
NdR6eLaE8OQ,188480,190319,a couple of tricks tom's used to make
NdR6eLaE8OQ,190319,192000,himself appear taller as we just
NdR6eLaE8OQ,192000,193599,mentioned shoe lifts can be a great
NdR6eLaE8OQ,193599,195599,solution in a nutshell these are simple
NdR6eLaE8OQ,195599,197440,insoles that can add a couple of inches
NdR6eLaE8OQ,197440,200400,to your height in a 2021 gq cover story
NdR6eLaE8OQ,200400,202159,he also mentioned that he would stand
NdR6eLaE8OQ,202159,203680,closer to the photographers than the
NdR6eLaE8OQ,203680,205760,people behind him to make himself appear
NdR6eLaE8OQ,205760,207920,bigger honestly it's not a bad idea but
NdR6eLaE8OQ,207920,211040,we love tom either way ice we know we
NdR6eLaE8OQ,211040,213280,know every couple of red carpet secrets
NdR6eLaE8OQ,213280,215120,we share seems to get more and more
NdR6eLaE8OQ,215120,216640,bizarre but these are things that
NdR6eLaE8OQ,216640,218400,actually work well at least they work
NdR6eLaE8OQ,218400,220159,for the celebrities that use them and in
NdR6eLaE8OQ,220159,222480,this case riverdale's madeleine petch is
NdR6eLaE8OQ,222480,224799,a big fan of using ice to prep her skin
NdR6eLaE8OQ,224799,226720,for any event when she went through her
NdR6eLaE8OQ,226720,228879,extensive skincare routine with vogue
NdR6eLaE8OQ,228879,230720,she mentioned that she likes using ice
NdR6eLaE8OQ,230720,232959,on her face to de-puff her face but she
NdR6eLaE8OQ,232959,234319,also mentioned if you don't have one of
NdR6eLaE8OQ,234319,235840,these at home i just recommend sticking
NdR6eLaE8OQ,235840,237120,your face in an ice bucket for 20
NdR6eLaE8OQ,237120,239360,seconds literally that's it and she's
NdR6eLaE8OQ,239360,241439,not completely wrong many skin care

NdR6eLaE8OQ,243040,244799,using jade rollers that are left in the
NdR6eLaE8OQ,244799,247200,freezer or using ice under their eyes
NdR6eLaE8OQ,247200,249680,butt pads they may not be anything too
NdR6eLaE8OQ,249680,252000,new but celebrities and influencers have
NdR6eLaE8OQ,252000,254000,been known to use butt pads for a while
NdR6eLaE8OQ,254000,256079,now and one celebrity who's proud to
NdR6eLaE8OQ,256079,258000,show off the tricks she uses to achieve
NdR6eLaE8OQ,258000,260239,her perfect red carpet moment is kristin

NdR6eLaE8OQ,281919,283840,we're not talking about the food you eat
NdR6eLaE8OQ,283840,285520,similar to butt pads this isn't
NdR6eLaE8OQ,285520,287680,necessarily a new trick either but it's
NdR6eLaE8OQ,287680,289520,definitely one that's tried and true
NdR6eLaE8OQ,289520,291680,just ask modern family actress sarah

NdR6eLaE8OQ,316320,318560,one thing in common their love for mindy
NdR6eLaE8OQ,318560,320720,kaling's sense of humor and it shows
NdR6eLaE8OQ,320720,322880,both on and off screen especially when
NdR6eLaE8OQ,322880,325440,it comes to her award show prep in 2016
NdR6eLaE8OQ,325440,326880,when mindy was getting ready for the
NdR6eLaE8OQ,326880,328880,costume designers guild awards she

NdR6eLaE8OQ,342639,344720,post is very on brand from mindy's sense
NdR6eLaE8OQ,344720,346400,of humor and she looked stunning at the
NdR6eLaE8OQ,346400,347680,award show
NdR6eLaE8OQ,347680,348800,jeggings
NdR6eLaE8OQ,348800,350639,when you're at a red carpet event filled
NdR6eLaE8OQ,350639,352400,with famous celebrities and expensive
NdR6eLaE8OQ,352400,354479,outfits wearing jeggings may not seem
NdR6eLaE8OQ,354479,356240,like the best option oh those are
NdR6eLaE8OQ,356240,357919,leggings that looked like jeans for
NdR6eLaE8OQ,357919,359680,those of you who may not have lived in
NdR6eLaE8OQ,359680,361919,those things in the early 2000s but that
NdR6eLaE8OQ,361919,363919,surely didn't stop jamila jamil from
NdR6eLaE8OQ,363919,366080,doing just that in her own way for the
NdR6eLaE8OQ,366080,368479,2019 golden globes she wore a pink
NdR6eLaE8OQ,368479,370880,monique louie gown with a pair of denim
NdR6eLaE8OQ,370880,373199,jeggings underneath i'm wearing jeans
NdR6eLaE8OQ,373199,374639,underneath the gown
NdR6eLaE8OQ,374639,377680,because i was i don't want to be cold
NdR6eLaE8OQ,377680,379360,when speaking about her decision to do
NdR6eLaE8OQ,379360,381520,that she told usa today well it's
NdR6eLaE8OQ,381520,383520,freezing i don't believe in suffering
NdR6eLaE8OQ,383520,385039,for fashion i would like to be
NdR6eLaE8OQ,385039,387280,comfortable and not gonna lie we hear
NdR6eLaE8OQ,387280,389360,that one loud and clear like if zendaya
NdR6eLaE8OQ,389360,391199,can wear plain white socks what's wrong
NdR6eLaE8OQ,391199,393360,with jamila jamil wearing jeggings it's
NdR6eLaE8OQ,393360,395840,actually pretty smart and let's be real
NdR6eLaE8OQ,395840,397840,there's only so much smiling a person
NdR6eLaE8OQ,397840,399600,can do when it feels like it's freezing
NdR6eLaE8OQ,399600,402319,outside laser hair removal there are
NdR6eLaE8OQ,402319,404080,plenty of award shows that call for
NdR6eLaE8OQ,404080,406720,extravagant ensembles a-list celebrities
NdR6eLaE8OQ,406720,409120,and big budgets but the met gala is the
NdR6eLaE8OQ,409120,411199,red carpet event of the year where all
NdR6eLaE8OQ,411199,413039,of those things are present on an even
NdR6eLaE8OQ,413039,415360,bigger scale so when ashley graham was
NdR6eLaE8OQ,415360,417840,getting ready for the event in 2018 she
NdR6eLaE8OQ,417840,420160,got the works in a video posted on her
NdR6eLaE8OQ,420160,422400,instagram she showed herself in pre-glam
NdR6eLaE8OQ,422400,424720,mode getting a laser nose hair zapping
NdR6eLaE8OQ,424720,426720,treatment from her esthetician mazia
NdR6eLaE8OQ,426720,429199,shimon mazia also told new beauty that
NdR6eLaE8OQ,429199,431280,aside from the laser treatment she also
NdR6eLaE8OQ,431280,433919,gave ashley red led light therapy on her
NdR6eLaE8OQ,433919,436560,face and body as well as oxygen infusion
NdR6eLaE8OQ,436560,438880,to plump her skin these honestly sound
NdR6eLaE8OQ,438880,440560,like treatments used to take care of
NdR6eLaE8OQ,440560,442960,harsh medical conditions but when one of
NdR6eLaE8OQ,442960,444560,the biggest red carpet events of the
NdR6eLaE8OQ,444560,446479,year is happening we'd probably take
NdR6eLaE8OQ,446479,448479,advice from an esthetician too and
NdR6eLaE8OQ,448479,450720,ashley looked gorgeous for the event
NdR6eLaE8OQ,450720,452960,laying down in a car it may seem a
NdR6eLaE8OQ,452960,454880,little weird but this technique actually
NdR6eLaE8OQ,454880,456479,makes sense when you think about it when
NdR6eLaE8OQ,456479,458240,you're dressed up for an award show
NdR6eLaE8OQ,458240,460880,especially in a silk gown the very last
NdR6eLaE8OQ,460880,462960,thing you want is wrinkles and jennifer
NdR6eLaE8OQ,462960,465599,aniston agrees in 2020 she showed up to
NdR6eLaE8OQ,465599,467919,the sag awards wearing a white silk dior
NdR6eLaE8OQ,467919,470160,gown she later posted a photo of herself
NdR6eLaE8OQ,470160,472639,on ig arriving at the award show in an
NdR6eLaE8OQ,472639,474720,almost fully horizontal position in the
NdR6eLaE8OQ,474720,476560,back of a car to keep her dress from
NdR6eLaE8OQ,476560,478160,getting wrinkled on the way there she
NdR6eLaE8OQ,478160,480479,wrote in her caption no wrinkles harder
NdR6eLaE8OQ,480479,481680,than it looks
NdR6eLaE8OQ,481680,484080,bigger shoes during award shows and red
NdR6eLaE8OQ,484080,486000,carpet events it's normal for people to
NdR6eLaE8OQ,486000,487919,pay close attention to a celebrity's
NdR6eLaE8OQ,487919,489680,outfit or their hair and makeup and
NdR6eLaE8OQ,489680,491759,while shoes are often a huge part of
NdR6eLaE8OQ,491759,493599,what makes an outfit work those of us
NdR6eLaE8OQ,493599,495680,who aren't award show photographers
NdR6eLaE8OQ,495680,497840,rarely pay attention to the actual fit
NdR6eLaE8OQ,497840,499759,of the shoe but if you look close enough
NdR6eLaE8OQ,499759,501680,you'll notice that a lot of celebrities
NdR6eLaE8OQ,501680,503520,including duchess of sussex meghan
NdR6eLaE8OQ,503520,505919,markle tend to opt for a slightly bigger
NdR6eLaE8OQ,505919,507520,shoe size when they're attending events
NdR6eLaE8OQ,507520,509280,that require them to be on their feet
NdR6eLaE8OQ,509280,511120,this is done to avoid bruising
NdR6eLaE8OQ,511120,513599,especially during long events eyebrow
