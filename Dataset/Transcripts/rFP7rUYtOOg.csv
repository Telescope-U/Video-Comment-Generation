rFP7rUYtOOg,80,1520,if you're building a web or mobile app
rFP7rUYtOOg,1520,3679,in 2022 there's literally a million
rFP7rUYtOOg,3679,5200,different ways to get the job done by
rFP7rUYtOOg,5200,6560,combining different front-end and
rFP7rUYtOOg,6560,8639,back-end libraries along with apis
rFP7rUYtOOg,8639,10559,tooling and infrastructure to form a
rFP7rUYtOOg,10559,12400,complete tech stack in today's video i
rFP7rUYtOOg,12400,14240,want to give you a guided tour of my
rFP7rUYtOOg,14240,16000,tech stack which i plan on using through
rFP7rUYtOOg,16000,17920,2025 assuming the world hasn't been
rFP7rUYtOOg,17920,19600,destroyed by that point not only will i
rFP7rUYtOOg,19600,20960,explain my thought process when making
rFP7rUYtOOg,20960,22640,these decisions but we'll also look at a
rFP7rUYtOOg,22640,24240,ton of alternatives that you may want to
rFP7rUYtOOg,24240,25599,consider for yourself because you
rFP7rUYtOOg,25599,27039,definitely shouldn't just copy some
rFP7rUYtOOg,27039,28800,random guy on youtube before we get into
rFP7rUYtOOg,28800,30640,it as many of you know i recently had a
rFP7rUYtOOg,30640,32160,baby i haven't been uploading quite as
rFP7rUYtOOg,32160,33920,many videos but it's given me time to
rFP7rUYtOOg,33920,35920,work on a complete rebuild of fireship
rFP7rUYtOOg,35920,37840,io and in the process i've analyzed all
rFP7rUYtOOg,37840,39280,kinds of different technologies that i
rFP7rUYtOOg,39280,41280,might want to use for that project now i
rFP7rUYtOOg,41280,43040,don't really need to rebuild fireship
rFP7rUYtOOg,43040,44559,but i do it every couple years just
rFP7rUYtOOg,44559,46399,because i enjoy the process most of the
rFP7rUYtOOg,46399,48079,coding i'll do with my bare hands but
rFP7rUYtOOg,48079,49840,the project will be open source and i
rFP7rUYtOOg,49840,51360,will likely collaborate with a couple of
rFP7rUYtOOg,51360,53360,other engineers to round out the project
rFP7rUYtOOg,53360,54879,it's a small team effort which is an
rFP7rUYtOOg,54879,56480,important consideration when choosing
rFP7rUYtOOg,56480,57680,your tech stack because many
rFP7rUYtOOg,57680,59600,technologies are more well-suited for
rFP7rUYtOOg,59600,61440,large teams software engineers love to
rFP7rUYtOOg,61440,63440,flex that tech stack gotta be bustin or
rFP7rUYtOOg,63440,65119,drippin in other words ridiculously
rFP7rUYtOOg,65119,66960,over-engineered the reality is that i
rFP7rUYtOOg,66960,68960,could build fireship as a wordpress blog
rFP7rUYtOOg,68960,71040,add a membership plugin and scale it up
rFP7rUYtOOg,71040,72880,to millions of users if i want to make
rFP7rUYtOOg,72880,74240,money that would be the smart thing to
rFP7rUYtOOg,74240,75759,do but i want to build something a
rFP7rUYtOOg,75759,76960,little more special than just a
rFP7rUYtOOg,76960,78560,wordpress blog in the next version of
rFP7rUYtOOg,78560,80159,the site courses will have progress
rFP7rUYtOOg,80159,81520,tracking that will also include
rFP7rUYtOOg,81520,83520,challenges like quizzes and interactive
rFP7rUYtOOg,83520,85439,demos powered by stack blitz in my
rFP7rUYtOOg,85439,87040,experience the majority of modern web
rFP7rUYtOOg,87040,88720,development happens on the front end
rFP7rUYtOOg,88720,90000,that being said one of the most
rFP7rUYtOOg,90000,91680,important decisions to make is your
rFP7rUYtOOg,91680,93840,front-end ui library and for that i have
rFP7rUYtOOg,93840,95920,chosen svelt i've built something with
rFP7rUYtOOg,95920,97439,pretty much every ui library on the
rFP7rUYtOOg,97439,99280,market they all have their pros and cons
rFP7rUYtOOg,99280,100880,but svelte is the one that feels most
rFP7rUYtOOg,100880,102880,productive to me and coincidentally just
rFP7rUYtOOg,102880,104560,yesterday it debuted at the top of the
rFP7rUYtOOg,104560,106240,most loved web frameworks on the stack
rFP7rUYtOOg,106240,108640,overflow 2022 survey i think developers
rFP7rUYtOOg,108640,110079,love it for how natural it makes
rFP7rUYtOOg,110079,111840,reactive data feel when a mutable
rFP7rUYtOOg,111840,114079,variable changes the ui reacts you don't
rFP7rUYtOOg,114079,115520,have to jump through any weird hoops to
rFP7rUYtOOg,115520,117119,make things reactive now the other thing
rFP7rUYtOOg,117119,118799,i really like about spelt is the way you
rFP7rUYtOOg,118799,120640,share data across components which is
rFP7rUYtOOg,120640,122479,done with stores a store is like a
rFP7rUYtOOg,122479,124799,subject in rxjs that can be observed
rFP7rUYtOOg,124799,126399,anywhere in the application by simply
rFP7rUYtOOg,126399,127920,putting a dollar sign in front of it
rFP7rUYtOOg,127920,129520,this pattern is actually very similar to
rFP7rUYtOOg,129520,131280,the way things are done in angular but
rFP7rUYtOOg,131280,132480,svelte does it with a lot less
rFP7rUYtOOg,132480,133920,boilerplate the current version of
rFP7rUYtOOg,133920,135840,fireship is actually built with angular
rFP7rUYtOOg,135840,137760,and in my opinion angular is awesome and
rFP7rUYtOOg,137760,139440,the most underappreciated framework out
rFP7rUYtOOg,139440,140879,there it's extremely popular in
rFP7rUYtOOg,140879,143599,enterprise for a good reason but in 2022
rFP7rUYtOOg,143599,145200,react is definitely still the most
rFP7rUYtOOg,145200,147200,popular ui library and it has a huge
rFP7rUYtOOg,147200,149120,ecosystem of supporting libraries i
rFP7rUYtOOg,149120,150160,think that's the most compelling
rFP7rUYtOOg,150160,151920,argument to use it when it comes down to
rFP7rUYtOOg,151920,153920,the ui library itself there are cleaner
rFP7rUYtOOg,153920,155680,options out there like solid js that
rFP7rUYtOOg,155680,157599,would also provide better performance i
rFP7rUYtOOg,157599,159360,also seriously considered vue which is
rFP7rUYtOOg,159360,161200,not only a great framework but also has
rFP7rUYtOOg,161200,162879,a large number of supporting libraries
rFP7rUYtOOg,162879,164480,as well but the more important decision
rFP7rUYtOOg,164480,166000,is which meta framework do you want to
rFP7rUYtOOg,166000,168640,use react has next view as next angular
rFP7rUYtOOg,168640,171360,has universal and svelt has kit most
rFP7rUYtOOg,171360,172959,applications out there need some form of
rFP7rUYtOOg,172959,174560,server-side rendering to make their
rFP7rUYtOOg,174560,176640,sites visible to search engines and bots
rFP7rUYtOOg,176640,178959,spelt kit is the official ssr solution
rFP7rUYtOOg,178959,180640,that's being worked on by rich harris
rFP7rUYtOOg,180640,182720,but as of today it's still in beta using
rFP7rUYtOOg,182720,184080,a framework that's not at a stable
rFP7rUYtOOg,184080,185760,release is kind of risky you could pour
rFP7rUYtOOg,185760,187200,a ton of work into an app then the
rFP7rUYtOOg,187200,188800,framework developers decide to pull a
rFP7rUYtOOg,188800,190159,feature on the final release that
rFP7rUYtOOg,190159,192239,torpedoes your entire business not very
rFP7rUYtOOg,192239,193920,likely so that's a risk i'm willing to
rFP7rUYtOOg,193920,195840,take now there are other ways to server
rFP7rUYtOOg,195840,197599,render spelt another good option is
rFP7rUYtOOg,197599,199599,astro it has a lot of awesome features
rFP7rUYtOOg,199599,201440,for content driven sites but the reason
rFP7rUYtOOg,201440,203280,i prefer spelt kit for this project is
rFP7rUYtOOg,203280,204959,because it does client-side routing
rFP7rUYtOOg,204959,206480,after the initial page load which
rFP7rUYtOOg,206480,208159,becomes important on more interactive
rFP7rUYtOOg,208159,209360,sites especially when user
rFP7rUYtOOg,209360,211280,authentication is involved but my plan
rFP7rUYtOOg,211280,212640,is to use astro for my personal
rFP7rUYtOOg,212640,214080,portfolio if i ever get around to
rFP7rUYtOOg,214080,215599,rebuilding it now the other framework
rFP7rUYtOOg,215599,217280,that i would say is my second choice is
rFP7rUYtOOg,217280,219120,next js next is already a great
rFP7rUYtOOg,219120,220640,framework but it has a bunch of cool
rFP7rUYtOOg,220640,222640,stuff coming as well like nested routing
rFP7rUYtOOg,222640,224319,and stuff like that i also recently made
rFP7rUYtOOg,224319,226239,a video on next yet another awesome
rFP7rUYtOOg,226239,227440,framework that i hope to make a full
rFP7rUYtOOg,227440,229120,course on in the future it's also worth
rFP7rUYtOOg,229120,230480,mentioning that there's a new framework
rFP7rUYtOOg,230480,232000,called quick that has an entirely
rFP7rUYtOOg,232000,233200,different take on rendering with
rFP7rUYtOOg,233200,235680,resumable or replayable applications but
rFP7rUYtOOg,235680,237200,even that's a little too bleeding edge
rFP7rUYtOOg,237200,238799,for me now when it comes to server
rFP7rUYtOOg,238799,240480,rendering you don't need to use a meta
rFP7rUYtOOg,240480,242319,framework that's tied to some javascript
rFP7rUYtOOg,242319,244480,library instead you can use a full stack
rFP7rUYtOOg,244480,246720,framework like ruby on rails laravel
rFP7rUYtOOg,246720,248799,django or whatever to render all of your
rFP7rUYtOOg,248799,250480,content on the server these frameworks
rFP7rUYtOOg,250480,252000,have advantages for certain types of
rFP7rUYtOOg,252000,254000,applications but in my case full-blown
rFP7rUYtOOg,254000,255439,server-side rendering is not really
rFP7rUYtOOg,255439,257040,necessary because the content on the
rFP7rUYtOOg,257040,258560,actual site doesn't change all that
rFP7rUYtOOg,258560,260799,often it's far more simple to pre-render
rFP7rUYtOOg,260799,262720,the entire site upload it to a storage
rFP7rUYtOOg,262720,264880,bucket and then cache it on a cdn around
rFP7rUYtOOg,264880,266160,the world when you have a dedicated
rFP7rUYtOOg,266160,267680,server you then need to think about how
rFP7rUYtOOg,267680,269280,to scale it with either serverless
rFP7rUYtOOg,269280,270639,functions or if you want a really
rFP7rUYtOOg,270639,272240,complicated tech stack something like
rFP7rUYtOOg,272240,273759,kubernetes the next thing i want to talk
rFP7rUYtOOg,273759,275600,about is typescript if you're building a
rFP7rUYtOOg,275600,277360,big complicated project you should use
rFP7rUYtOOg,277360,279120,it in the end a more complicated
rFP7rUYtOOg,279120,280800,question you'll have to ask is how am i
rFP7rUYtOOg,280800,283120,going to manage my css when i work on a
rFP7rUYtOOg,283120,285040,solo project i spend more time
rFP7rUYtOOg,285040,286800,around with the css than i do writing
rFP7rUYtOOg,286800,288960,javascript it's depressing man i've only
rFP7rUYtOOg,288960,291280,got so much time left to hold fortran 3.
rFP7rUYtOOg,291280,293040,life goes by much faster than we think
rFP7rUYtOOg,293040,294720,yet here i am wasting hours of this
rFP7rUYtOOg,294720,296240,precious time trying to figure out why
rFP7rUYtOOg,296240,298320,this navbar won't be sticky that being
rFP7rUYtOOg,298320,300639,said a tool that makes css much easier
rFP7rUYtOOg,300639,302639,is tailwind most importantly it makes
rFP7rUYtOOg,302639,304400,prototyping and the implementation of
rFP7rUYtOOg,304400,306560,your designs go much faster i like to
rFP7rUYtOOg,306560,308240,have a lot of control over my designs
rFP7rUYtOOg,308240,310320,because for me it's a creative process
rFP7rUYtOOg,310320,311759,tailwind won't magically make your
rFP7rUYtOOg,311759,313600,website look good but it does provide
rFP7rUYtOOg,313600,315360,enough of a framework to get things done
rFP7rUYtOOg,315360,316720,way quicker the current version of
rFP7rUYtOOg,316720,319440,fireship is 100 custom with sas with
rFP7rUYtOOg,319440,320960,tailwind i feel like i have the same
rFP7rUYtOOg,320960,322479,amount of control but things just get
rFP7rUYtOOg,322479,324479,done much more rapidly and another huge
rFP7rUYtOOg,324479,325919,benefit is that it will automatically
rFP7rUYtOOg,325919,328240,purge styles to keep the css bundle as
rFP7rUYtOOg,328240,330000,small as possible that's important
rFP7rUYtOOg,330000,331520,because the initial page load speed for
rFP7rUYtOOg,331520,333440,my site is critical if you like the
rFP7rUYtOOg,333440,335440,utility class approach another option to
rFP7rUYtOOg,335440,337600,check out is windy css or if you don't
rFP7rUYtOOg,337600,339280,care about having that much control you
rFP7rUYtOOg,339280,340720,can use something like bootstrap in
rFP7rUYtOOg,340720,342720,addition to many other css frameworks
rFP7rUYtOOg,342720,344320,out there and you've also got tons of
rFP7rUYtOOg,344320,346080,framework-specific ui libraries to
rFP7rUYtOOg,346080,347759,analyze as well and if you're using
rFP7rUYtOOg,347759,349520,tailwind you should definitely check out
rFP7rUYtOOg,349520,351520,daisy ui but i'm just doing everything
rFP7rUYtOOg,351520,353680,from scratch myself because i'm an idiot
rFP7rUYtOOg,353680,355199,that's enough for the front end now i
rFP7rUYtOOg,355199,356880,want to talk about the back end as you
rFP7rUYtOOg,356880,358720,know i'm a big fan of firebase and it's
rFP7rUYtOOg,358720,360240,been the foundation of this channel from
rFP7rUYtOOg,360240,362160,day one but as i've grown older and
rFP7rUYtOOg,362160,363840,wiser i've come to realize something
rFP7rUYtOOg,363840,365680,about firebase this may be shocking to
rFP7rUYtOOg,365680,367680,some of you but firebase is still
rFP7rUYtOOg,367680,369440,awesome and i plan on using it until the
rFP7rUYtOOg,369440,371120,day i die or at least until google
rFP7rUYtOOg,371120,372880,decides to kill it whichever comes first
rFP7rUYtOOg,372880,375280,firebase will do 90 of what most apps
rFP7rUYtOOg,375280,377199,need on the back end the main drawback
rFP7rUYtOOg,377199,378720,is that you're tightly locked into
rFP7rUYtOOg,378720,380560,google cloud platform and you may run
rFP7rUYtOOg,380560,382160,into edge cases that it just doesn't
rFP7rUYtOOg,382160,384080,support like advanced authentication
rFP7rUYtOOg,384080,386479,features or complex database queries and
rFP7rUYtOOg,386479,388080,that can be a deal breaker for certain
rFP7rUYtOOg,388080,389759,types of apps what you could do is
rFP7rUYtOOg,389759,391280,architect your entire backend from
rFP7rUYtOOg,391280,392639,scratch by picking and choosing
rFP7rUYtOOg,392639,394400,different services in the cloud but then
rFP7rUYtOOg,394400,395840,the complexity of your code base is
rFP7rUYtOOg,395840,398400,going to explode luckily in 2022 there
rFP7rUYtOOg,398400,400560,are quite a few alternatives to firebase
rFP7rUYtOOg,400560,403039,you've got big ones like aws amplify and
rFP7rUYtOOg,403039,405280,mongodb realm and then smaller startups
rFP7rUYtOOg,405280,407360,like enho superbase and app right i
rFP7rUYtOOg,407360,409120,recently compared all of them and each
rFP7rUYtOOg,409120,411039,one has its own set of unique trade-offs
rFP7rUYtOOg,411039,412880,expect a full video on that soon the
rFP7rUYtOOg,412880,414639,most important thing is the database
rFP7rUYtOOg,414639,416560,firebase uses firestore which is a
rFP7rUYtOOg,416560,418720,document database similar to mongodb
rFP7rUYtOOg,418720,420639,which can get the job done for most apps
rFP7rUYtOOg,420639,422319,but does have some limitations that can
rFP7rUYtOOg,422319,423680,be kind of annoying at times a
rFP7rUYtOOg,423680,425680,traditional sql database is probably the
rFP7rUYtOOg,425680,427520,safest bet for most people but they're
rFP7rUYtOOg,427520,428800,generally harder to work with although
rFP7rUYtOOg,428800,430400,there are some services out there like
rFP7rUYtOOg,430400,432479,planet scale and cockroachdb that have
rFP7rUYtOOg,432479,434400,made things a lot easier in recent years
rFP7rUYtOOg,434400,436080,especially when used with an orm like
rFP7rUYtOOg,436080,438000,prisma in addition you might consider
rFP7rUYtOOg,438000,440160,other nosql databases like redis and
rFP7rUYtOOg,440160,442080,cassandra which can actually be used as
rFP7rUYtOOg,442080,444080,a primary app database now in addition
rFP7rUYtOOg,444080,445840,to the back end there are a lot of other
rFP7rUYtOOg,445840,447599,smaller tools in the stack when it comes
rFP7rUYtOOg,447599,449280,to testing i find that i need to keep
rFP7rUYtOOg,449280,450960,things very simple otherwise i'm not
rFP7rUYtOOg,450960,452560,going to test anything at all and my
rFP7rUYtOOg,452560,454560,preferred way to do that is with cyprus
rFP7rUYtOOg,454560,456160,which is basically an all-in-one package
rFP7rUYtOOg,456160,457759,that can do everything from end-to-end
rFP7rUYtOOg,457759,459680,tests to individual unit tests and
rFP7rUYtOOg,459680,461199,everything in between if you're not into
rFP7rUYtOOg,461199,462720,cyprus another good option for
rFP7rUYtOOg,462720,464479,end-to-end testing as playwright and if
rFP7rUYtOOg,464479,466080,you just want to do unit tests another
rFP7rUYtOOg,466080,467280,framework i've really been wanting to
rFP7rUYtOOg,467280,469840,try out is v-test which is based on vee
rFP7rUYtOOg,469840,471919,the build tool that powers spelt kit my
rFP7rUYtOOg,471919,474240,tech stack also uses a variety of apis
rFP7rUYtOOg,474240,476240,to do things that i can't do on my own
rFP7rUYtOOg,476240,478400,one of which is send transactional email
rFP7rUYtOOg,478400,479840,i currently use sendgrid and will
rFP7rUYtOOg,479840,481440,continue doing so in the future but i
rFP7rUYtOOg,481440,483120,wish firebase or google cloud would come
rFP7rUYtOOg,483120,484720,out with its own email service in
rFP7rUYtOOg,484720,486639,addition a content driven site needs to
rFP7rUYtOOg,486639,488240,have really good full text search to
rFP7rUYtOOg,488240,490560,handle that i'm using algolia algolia
rFP7rUYtOOg,490560,492080,can get pretty expensive on very large
rFP7rUYtOOg,492080,494240,sites but for me it's pretty inexpensive
rFP7rUYtOOg,494240,496400,and very easy to use this is yet another
rFP7rUYtOOg,496400,497919,feature i wish would be implemented into
rFP7rUYtOOg,497919,499599,firebase but i'm not going to hold my
rFP7rUYtOOg,499599,501599,breath and finally i'll be using stripe
rFP7rUYtOOg,501599,503360,and paypal to manage payments because to
rFP7rUYtOOg,503360,504639,be honest i haven't looked at any
rFP7rUYtOOg,504639,506400,alternatives in a long time the end
rFP7rUYtOOg,506400,508080,result is a pretty simple tech stack
rFP7rUYtOOg,508080,509919,with the main components being spelt kit
rFP7rUYtOOg,509919,511919,and firebase the only major problem is
rFP7rUYtOOg,511919,513760,that it doesn't form an obvious acronym
rFP7rUYtOOg,513760,515760,we could go with the fist stack or maybe
rFP7rUYtOOg,515760,518240,fire kit or perhaps it but i don't
rFP7rUYtOOg,518240,519360,know man let me know if you have a
rFP7rUYtOOg,519360,521279,better idea thanks for watching and i
rFP7rUYtOOg,521279,524719,will see you in the next one
vid,start,end,text
rFP7rUYtOOg,80,1520,if you're building a web or mobile app
rFP7rUYtOOg,1520,3679,in 2022 there's literally a million
rFP7rUYtOOg,3679,5200,different ways to get the job done by
rFP7rUYtOOg,5200,6560,combining different front-end and
rFP7rUYtOOg,6560,8639,back-end libraries along with apis
rFP7rUYtOOg,8639,10559,tooling and infrastructure to form a
rFP7rUYtOOg,10559,12400,complete tech stack in today's video i
rFP7rUYtOOg,12400,14240,want to give you a guided tour of my
rFP7rUYtOOg,14240,16000,tech stack which i plan on using through
rFP7rUYtOOg,16000,17920,2025 assuming the world hasn't been
rFP7rUYtOOg,17920,19600,destroyed by that point not only will i
rFP7rUYtOOg,19600,20960,explain my thought process when making
rFP7rUYtOOg,20960,22640,these decisions but we'll also look at a
rFP7rUYtOOg,22640,24240,ton of alternatives that you may want to
rFP7rUYtOOg,24240,25599,consider for yourself because you
rFP7rUYtOOg,25599,27039,definitely shouldn't just copy some
rFP7rUYtOOg,27039,28800,random guy on youtube before we get into
rFP7rUYtOOg,28800,30640,it as many of you know i recently had a
rFP7rUYtOOg,30640,32160,baby i haven't been uploading quite as
rFP7rUYtOOg,32160,33920,many videos but it's given me time to
rFP7rUYtOOg,33920,35920,work on a complete rebuild of fireship
rFP7rUYtOOg,35920,37840,io and in the process i've analyzed all
rFP7rUYtOOg,37840,39280,kinds of different technologies that i
rFP7rUYtOOg,39280,41280,might want to use for that project now i
rFP7rUYtOOg,41280,43040,don't really need to rebuild fireship
rFP7rUYtOOg,43040,44559,but i do it every couple years just
rFP7rUYtOOg,44559,46399,because i enjoy the process most of the
rFP7rUYtOOg,46399,48079,coding i'll do with my bare hands but
rFP7rUYtOOg,48079,49840,the project will be open source and i
rFP7rUYtOOg,49840,51360,will likely collaborate with a couple of
rFP7rUYtOOg,51360,53360,other engineers to round out the project
rFP7rUYtOOg,53360,54879,it's a small team effort which is an
rFP7rUYtOOg,54879,56480,important consideration when choosing
rFP7rUYtOOg,56480,57680,your tech stack because many
rFP7rUYtOOg,57680,59600,technologies are more well-suited for
rFP7rUYtOOg,59600,61440,large teams software engineers love to
rFP7rUYtOOg,61440,63440,flex that tech stack gotta be bustin or
rFP7rUYtOOg,63440,65119,drippin in other words ridiculously
rFP7rUYtOOg,65119,66960,over-engineered the reality is that i
rFP7rUYtOOg,66960,68960,could build fireship as a wordpress blog
rFP7rUYtOOg,68960,71040,add a membership plugin and scale it up
rFP7rUYtOOg,71040,72880,to millions of users if i want to make
rFP7rUYtOOg,72880,74240,money that would be the smart thing to
rFP7rUYtOOg,74240,75759,do but i want to build something a
rFP7rUYtOOg,75759,76960,little more special than just a
rFP7rUYtOOg,76960,78560,wordpress blog in the next version of
rFP7rUYtOOg,78560,80159,the site courses will have progress
rFP7rUYtOOg,80159,81520,tracking that will also include
rFP7rUYtOOg,81520,83520,challenges like quizzes and interactive
rFP7rUYtOOg,83520,85439,demos powered by stack blitz in my
rFP7rUYtOOg,85439,87040,experience the majority of modern web
rFP7rUYtOOg,87040,88720,development happens on the front end
rFP7rUYtOOg,88720,90000,that being said one of the most
rFP7rUYtOOg,90000,91680,important decisions to make is your
rFP7rUYtOOg,91680,93840,front-end ui library and for that i have
rFP7rUYtOOg,93840,95920,chosen svelt i've built something with
rFP7rUYtOOg,95920,97439,pretty much every ui library on the
rFP7rUYtOOg,97439,99280,market they all have their pros and cons
rFP7rUYtOOg,99280,100880,but svelte is the one that feels most
rFP7rUYtOOg,100880,102880,productive to me and coincidentally just
rFP7rUYtOOg,102880,104560,yesterday it debuted at the top of the
rFP7rUYtOOg,104560,106240,most loved web frameworks on the stack
rFP7rUYtOOg,106240,108640,overflow 2022 survey i think developers
rFP7rUYtOOg,108640,110079,love it for how natural it makes
rFP7rUYtOOg,110079,111840,reactive data feel when a mutable
rFP7rUYtOOg,111840,114079,variable changes the ui reacts you don't
rFP7rUYtOOg,114079,115520,have to jump through any weird hoops to
rFP7rUYtOOg,115520,117119,make things reactive now the other thing
rFP7rUYtOOg,117119,118799,i really like about spelt is the way you
rFP7rUYtOOg,118799,120640,share data across components which is
rFP7rUYtOOg,120640,122479,done with stores a store is like a
rFP7rUYtOOg,122479,124799,subject in rxjs that can be observed
rFP7rUYtOOg,124799,126399,anywhere in the application by simply
rFP7rUYtOOg,126399,127920,putting a dollar sign in front of it
rFP7rUYtOOg,127920,129520,this pattern is actually very similar to
rFP7rUYtOOg,129520,131280,the way things are done in angular but
rFP7rUYtOOg,131280,132480,svelte does it with a lot less
rFP7rUYtOOg,132480,133920,boilerplate the current version of
rFP7rUYtOOg,133920,135840,fireship is actually built with angular
rFP7rUYtOOg,135840,137760,and in my opinion angular is awesome and
rFP7rUYtOOg,137760,139440,the most underappreciated framework out
rFP7rUYtOOg,139440,140879,there it's extremely popular in
rFP7rUYtOOg,140879,143599,enterprise for a good reason but in 2022
rFP7rUYtOOg,143599,145200,react is definitely still the most
rFP7rUYtOOg,145200,147200,popular ui library and it has a huge
rFP7rUYtOOg,147200,149120,ecosystem of supporting libraries i
rFP7rUYtOOg,149120,150160,think that's the most compelling
rFP7rUYtOOg,150160,151920,argument to use it when it comes down to
rFP7rUYtOOg,151920,153920,the ui library itself there are cleaner
rFP7rUYtOOg,153920,155680,options out there like solid js that
rFP7rUYtOOg,155680,157599,would also provide better performance i
rFP7rUYtOOg,157599,159360,also seriously considered vue which is
rFP7rUYtOOg,159360,161200,not only a great framework but also has
rFP7rUYtOOg,161200,162879,a large number of supporting libraries
rFP7rUYtOOg,162879,164480,as well but the more important decision
rFP7rUYtOOg,164480,166000,is which meta framework do you want to
rFP7rUYtOOg,166000,168640,use react has next view as next angular
rFP7rUYtOOg,168640,171360,has universal and svelt has kit most
rFP7rUYtOOg,171360,172959,applications out there need some form of
rFP7rUYtOOg,172959,174560,server-side rendering to make their
rFP7rUYtOOg,174560,176640,sites visible to search engines and bots
rFP7rUYtOOg,176640,178959,spelt kit is the official ssr solution
rFP7rUYtOOg,178959,180640,that's being worked on by rich harris
rFP7rUYtOOg,180640,182720,but as of today it's still in beta using
rFP7rUYtOOg,182720,184080,a framework that's not at a stable
rFP7rUYtOOg,184080,185760,release is kind of risky you could pour
rFP7rUYtOOg,185760,187200,a ton of work into an app then the
rFP7rUYtOOg,187200,188800,framework developers decide to pull a
rFP7rUYtOOg,188800,190159,feature on the final release that
rFP7rUYtOOg,190159,192239,torpedoes your entire business not very
rFP7rUYtOOg,192239,193920,likely so that's a risk i'm willing to
rFP7rUYtOOg,193920,195840,take now there are other ways to server
rFP7rUYtOOg,195840,197599,render spelt another good option is
rFP7rUYtOOg,197599,199599,astro it has a lot of awesome features
rFP7rUYtOOg,199599,201440,for content driven sites but the reason
rFP7rUYtOOg,201440,203280,i prefer spelt kit for this project is
rFP7rUYtOOg,203280,204959,because it does client-side routing
rFP7rUYtOOg,204959,206480,after the initial page load which
rFP7rUYtOOg,206480,208159,becomes important on more interactive
rFP7rUYtOOg,208159,209360,sites especially when user
rFP7rUYtOOg,209360,211280,authentication is involved but my plan
rFP7rUYtOOg,211280,212640,is to use astro for my personal
rFP7rUYtOOg,212640,214080,portfolio if i ever get around to
rFP7rUYtOOg,214080,215599,rebuilding it now the other framework
rFP7rUYtOOg,215599,217280,that i would say is my second choice is
rFP7rUYtOOg,217280,219120,next js next is already a great
rFP7rUYtOOg,219120,220640,framework but it has a bunch of cool
rFP7rUYtOOg,220640,222640,stuff coming as well like nested routing
rFP7rUYtOOg,222640,224319,and stuff like that i also recently made
rFP7rUYtOOg,224319,226239,a video on next yet another awesome
rFP7rUYtOOg,226239,227440,framework that i hope to make a full
rFP7rUYtOOg,227440,229120,course on in the future it's also worth
rFP7rUYtOOg,229120,230480,mentioning that there's a new framework
rFP7rUYtOOg,230480,232000,called quick that has an entirely
rFP7rUYtOOg,232000,233200,different take on rendering with
rFP7rUYtOOg,233200,235680,resumable or replayable applications but
rFP7rUYtOOg,235680,237200,even that's a little too bleeding edge
rFP7rUYtOOg,237200,238799,for me now when it comes to server
rFP7rUYtOOg,238799,240480,rendering you don't need to use a meta
rFP7rUYtOOg,240480,242319,framework that's tied to some javascript
rFP7rUYtOOg,242319,244480,library instead you can use a full stack
rFP7rUYtOOg,244480,246720,framework like ruby on rails laravel
rFP7rUYtOOg,246720,248799,django or whatever to render all of your
rFP7rUYtOOg,248799,250480,content on the server these frameworks
rFP7rUYtOOg,250480,252000,have advantages for certain types of
rFP7rUYtOOg,252000,254000,applications but in my case full-blown
rFP7rUYtOOg,254000,255439,server-side rendering is not really
rFP7rUYtOOg,255439,257040,necessary because the content on the
rFP7rUYtOOg,257040,258560,actual site doesn't change all that
rFP7rUYtOOg,258560,260799,often it's far more simple to pre-render
rFP7rUYtOOg,260799,262720,the entire site upload it to a storage
rFP7rUYtOOg,262720,264880,bucket and then cache it on a cdn around
rFP7rUYtOOg,264880,266160,the world when you have a dedicated
rFP7rUYtOOg,266160,267680,server you then need to think about how
rFP7rUYtOOg,267680,269280,to scale it with either serverless
rFP7rUYtOOg,269280,270639,functions or if you want a really
rFP7rUYtOOg,270639,272240,complicated tech stack something like
rFP7rUYtOOg,272240,273759,kubernetes the next thing i want to talk
rFP7rUYtOOg,273759,275600,about is typescript if you're building a
rFP7rUYtOOg,275600,277360,big complicated project you should use
rFP7rUYtOOg,277360,279120,it in the end a more complicated
rFP7rUYtOOg,279120,280800,question you'll have to ask is how am i
rFP7rUYtOOg,280800,283120,going to manage my css when i work on a
rFP7rUYtOOg,283120,285040,solo project i spend more time
rFP7rUYtOOg,285040,286800,around with the css than i do writing
rFP7rUYtOOg,286800,288960,javascript it's depressing man i've only
rFP7rUYtOOg,288960,291280,got so much time left to hold fortran 3.
rFP7rUYtOOg,291280,293040,life goes by much faster than we think
rFP7rUYtOOg,293040,294720,yet here i am wasting hours of this
rFP7rUYtOOg,294720,296240,precious time trying to figure out why
rFP7rUYtOOg,296240,298320,this navbar won't be sticky that being
rFP7rUYtOOg,298320,300639,said a tool that makes css much easier
rFP7rUYtOOg,300639,302639,is tailwind most importantly it makes
rFP7rUYtOOg,302639,304400,prototyping and the implementation of
rFP7rUYtOOg,304400,306560,your designs go much faster i like to
rFP7rUYtOOg,306560,308240,have a lot of control over my designs
rFP7rUYtOOg,308240,310320,because for me it's a creative process
rFP7rUYtOOg,310320,311759,tailwind won't magically make your
rFP7rUYtOOg,311759,313600,website look good but it does provide
rFP7rUYtOOg,313600,315360,enough of a framework to get things done
rFP7rUYtOOg,315360,316720,way quicker the current version of
rFP7rUYtOOg,316720,319440,fireship is 100 custom with sas with
rFP7rUYtOOg,319440,320960,tailwind i feel like i have the same
rFP7rUYtOOg,320960,322479,amount of control but things just get
rFP7rUYtOOg,322479,324479,done much more rapidly and another huge
rFP7rUYtOOg,324479,325919,benefit is that it will automatically
rFP7rUYtOOg,325919,328240,purge styles to keep the css bundle as
rFP7rUYtOOg,328240,330000,small as possible that's important
rFP7rUYtOOg,330000,331520,because the initial page load speed for
rFP7rUYtOOg,331520,333440,my site is critical if you like the
rFP7rUYtOOg,333440,335440,utility class approach another option to
rFP7rUYtOOg,335440,337600,check out is windy css or if you don't
rFP7rUYtOOg,337600,339280,care about having that much control you
rFP7rUYtOOg,339280,340720,can use something like bootstrap in
rFP7rUYtOOg,340720,342720,addition to many other css frameworks
rFP7rUYtOOg,342720,344320,out there and you've also got tons of
rFP7rUYtOOg,344320,346080,framework-specific ui libraries to
rFP7rUYtOOg,346080,347759,analyze as well and if you're using
rFP7rUYtOOg,347759,349520,tailwind you should definitely check out
rFP7rUYtOOg,349520,351520,daisy ui but i'm just doing everything
rFP7rUYtOOg,351520,353680,from scratch myself because i'm an idiot
rFP7rUYtOOg,353680,355199,that's enough for the front end now i
rFP7rUYtOOg,355199,356880,want to talk about the back end as you
rFP7rUYtOOg,356880,358720,know i'm a big fan of firebase and it's
rFP7rUYtOOg,358720,360240,been the foundation of this channel from
rFP7rUYtOOg,360240,362160,day one but as i've grown older and
rFP7rUYtOOg,362160,363840,wiser i've come to realize something
rFP7rUYtOOg,363840,365680,about firebase this may be shocking to
rFP7rUYtOOg,365680,367680,some of you but firebase is still
rFP7rUYtOOg,367680,369440,awesome and i plan on using it until the
rFP7rUYtOOg,369440,371120,day i die or at least until google
rFP7rUYtOOg,371120,372880,decides to kill it whichever comes first
rFP7rUYtOOg,372880,375280,firebase will do 90 of what most apps
rFP7rUYtOOg,375280,377199,need on the back end the main drawback
rFP7rUYtOOg,377199,378720,is that you're tightly locked into
rFP7rUYtOOg,378720,380560,google cloud platform and you may run
rFP7rUYtOOg,380560,382160,into edge cases that it just doesn't
rFP7rUYtOOg,382160,384080,support like advanced authentication
rFP7rUYtOOg,384080,386479,features or complex database queries and
rFP7rUYtOOg,386479,388080,that can be a deal breaker for certain
rFP7rUYtOOg,388080,389759,types of apps what you could do is
rFP7rUYtOOg,389759,391280,architect your entire backend from
rFP7rUYtOOg,391280,392639,scratch by picking and choosing
rFP7rUYtOOg,392639,394400,different services in the cloud but then
rFP7rUYtOOg,394400,395840,the complexity of your code base is
rFP7rUYtOOg,395840,398400,going to explode luckily in 2022 there
rFP7rUYtOOg,398400,400560,are quite a few alternatives to firebase
rFP7rUYtOOg,400560,403039,you've got big ones like aws amplify and
rFP7rUYtOOg,403039,405280,mongodb realm and then smaller startups
rFP7rUYtOOg,405280,407360,like enho superbase and app right i
rFP7rUYtOOg,407360,409120,recently compared all of them and each
rFP7rUYtOOg,409120,411039,one has its own set of unique trade-offs
rFP7rUYtOOg,411039,412880,expect a full video on that soon the
rFP7rUYtOOg,412880,414639,most important thing is the database
rFP7rUYtOOg,414639,416560,firebase uses firestore which is a
rFP7rUYtOOg,416560,418720,document database similar to mongodb
rFP7rUYtOOg,418720,420639,which can get the job done for most apps
rFP7rUYtOOg,420639,422319,but does have some limitations that can
rFP7rUYtOOg,422319,423680,be kind of annoying at times a
rFP7rUYtOOg,423680,425680,traditional sql database is probably the
rFP7rUYtOOg,425680,427520,safest bet for most people but they're
rFP7rUYtOOg,427520,428800,generally harder to work with although
rFP7rUYtOOg,428800,430400,there are some services out there like
rFP7rUYtOOg,430400,432479,planet scale and cockroachdb that have
rFP7rUYtOOg,432479,434400,made things a lot easier in recent years
rFP7rUYtOOg,434400,436080,especially when used with an orm like
rFP7rUYtOOg,436080,438000,prisma in addition you might consider
rFP7rUYtOOg,438000,440160,other nosql databases like redis and
rFP7rUYtOOg,440160,442080,cassandra which can actually be used as
rFP7rUYtOOg,442080,444080,a primary app database now in addition
rFP7rUYtOOg,444080,445840,to the back end there are a lot of other
rFP7rUYtOOg,445840,447599,smaller tools in the stack when it comes
rFP7rUYtOOg,447599,449280,to testing i find that i need to keep
rFP7rUYtOOg,449280,450960,things very simple otherwise i'm not
rFP7rUYtOOg,450960,452560,going to test anything at all and my
rFP7rUYtOOg,452560,454560,preferred way to do that is with cyprus
rFP7rUYtOOg,454560,456160,which is basically an all-in-one package
rFP7rUYtOOg,456160,457759,that can do everything from end-to-end
rFP7rUYtOOg,457759,459680,tests to individual unit tests and
rFP7rUYtOOg,459680,461199,everything in between if you're not into
rFP7rUYtOOg,461199,462720,cyprus another good option for
rFP7rUYtOOg,462720,464479,end-to-end testing as playwright and if
rFP7rUYtOOg,464479,466080,you just want to do unit tests another
rFP7rUYtOOg,466080,467280,framework i've really been wanting to
rFP7rUYtOOg,467280,469840,try out is v-test which is based on vee
rFP7rUYtOOg,469840,471919,the build tool that powers spelt kit my
rFP7rUYtOOg,471919,474240,tech stack also uses a variety of apis
rFP7rUYtOOg,474240,476240,to do things that i can't do on my own
rFP7rUYtOOg,476240,478400,one of which is send transactional email
rFP7rUYtOOg,478400,479840,i currently use sendgrid and will
rFP7rUYtOOg,479840,481440,continue doing so in the future but i
rFP7rUYtOOg,481440,483120,wish firebase or google cloud would come
rFP7rUYtOOg,483120,484720,out with its own email service in
rFP7rUYtOOg,484720,486639,addition a content driven site needs to
rFP7rUYtOOg,486639,488240,have really good full text search to
rFP7rUYtOOg,488240,490560,handle that i'm using algolia algolia
rFP7rUYtOOg,490560,492080,can get pretty expensive on very large
rFP7rUYtOOg,492080,494240,sites but for me it's pretty inexpensive
rFP7rUYtOOg,494240,496400,and very easy to use this is yet another
rFP7rUYtOOg,496400,497919,feature i wish would be implemented into
rFP7rUYtOOg,497919,499599,firebase but i'm not going to hold my
rFP7rUYtOOg,499599,501599,breath and finally i'll be using stripe
rFP7rUYtOOg,501599,503360,and paypal to manage payments because to
rFP7rUYtOOg,503360,504639,be honest i haven't looked at any
rFP7rUYtOOg,504639,506400,alternatives in a long time the end
rFP7rUYtOOg,506400,508080,result is a pretty simple tech stack
rFP7rUYtOOg,508080,509919,with the main components being spelt kit
rFP7rUYtOOg,509919,511919,and firebase the only major problem is
rFP7rUYtOOg,511919,513760,that it doesn't form an obvious acronym
rFP7rUYtOOg,513760,515760,we could go with the fist stack or maybe
rFP7rUYtOOg,515760,518240,fire kit or perhaps it but i don't
rFP7rUYtOOg,518240,519360,know man let me know if you have a
rFP7rUYtOOg,519360,521279,better idea thanks for watching and i
rFP7rUYtOOg,521279,524719,will see you in the next one
