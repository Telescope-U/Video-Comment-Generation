l2EvNXWCXpE,1920,9630,you should be a monster  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,14960,20080,you know because everyone says well you  should be harmless virtuous you  shouldn't do anyone any harm you should
l2EvNXWCXpE,20080,25840,sheath your competitive instinct you  shouldn't try to win you don't want to  be too aggressive you don't want to be  too assertive you want to take a back
l2EvNXWCXpE,25840,32398,seat and all of that it's like wrong  you should be a monster an absolute  monster and then you should learn how to
l2EvNXWCXpE,32398,38000,control it  it's better to be a warrior in a garden
l2EvNXWCXpE,38000,44160,than a gardener in a war  it's like is there something wrong with  being competitive  there's nothing wrong with it there's
l2EvNXWCXpE,44160,50960,something wrong with cheating  there's something wrong with being a  tyrant there's something wrong with  winning unfairly all of those things are
l2EvNXWCXpE,50960,56879,bad but you don't want people to win  what's the difference between trying to  win and striving
l2EvNXWCXpE,56879,63760,to  all failure  is psychological this
l2EvNXWCXpE,63760,69840,failure this upset this  this catastrophe
l2EvNXWCXpE,69840,74950,if you aren't dead  then it's just psychological
l2EvNXWCXpE,74950,82880,[Music]  now  this does not mean that you won't lose
l2EvNXWCXpE,82880,87920,some battles because you will we all  will every transformation always gets
l2EvNXWCXpE,87920,94240,worse before it gets better it's  supposed to be that way it's not an easy  path  it's not for the ill-hearted or the weak
l2EvNXWCXpE,94240,100720,natured it's for the strong people and  before you embark on this journey  mentally you have to prepare yourself
l2EvNXWCXpE,100720,103720,for
l2EvNXWCXpE,106960,110220,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,112890,116979,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,118980,122699,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,125610,128860,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,133080,136719,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,138720,147000,no one's going to get worse before it  gets better  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,150560,155920,when you mark this journey you must know  that it's going to go down before it  comes up but when it comes up it's going
l2EvNXWCXpE,155920,161599,to go so much higher than you've ever  been  sacrificing today for tomorrow's  betterment
l2EvNXWCXpE,161599,166720,unless you're dead you are not defeated  and you have not failed
l2EvNXWCXpE,166720,172959,what you've done is you've learned  you've gained experience
l2EvNXWCXpE,173599,179599,and you're still alive  and you have
l2EvNXWCXpE,179599,186959,memories to make  so get up
l2EvNXWCXpE,186959,193120,and go get after it  as long as you
l2EvNXWCXpE,193120,200239,don't surrender as long as you don't  give up as long as you don't quit then  you haven't failed
l2EvNXWCXpE,200239,206720,i mean it's time to stop and it's time  to move even further  we're constantly looking at life what is
l2EvNXWCXpE,206720,213040,it what is it where are we you know look  how interesting look at different  cultures different beliefs you know how  do they come to that how do i feel about
l2EvNXWCXpE,213040,220560,that how do you know what do i think  it's it is a daily adventure you have  your voice it's there just do it do it
l2EvNXWCXpE,220560,226480,do it do it create it you know don't let  anyone stop you you will go through  things and while you're going through
l2EvNXWCXpE,226480,232239,them you can't understand why it's  happening to you  but after you go through it you get back
l2EvNXWCXpE,232239,239519,and you look at it and you say oh  now i understand why i needed that  lesson i couldn't understand it there
l2EvNXWCXpE,239519,249159,but after i got through it  then i saw that that was preparing me  for bigger and better things
l2EvNXWCXpE,265280,270240,you have to be equipped mentally to  endure this process
l2EvNXWCXpE,273120,278560,what am i going to do today  to change what i see in this mirror
l2EvNXWCXpE,278560,284639,how you address it is you face it  you face it every day you face it every
l2EvNXWCXpE,284639,289680,single day of your life  the things that how people look how
l2EvNXWCXpE,289680,295440,people like how smart someone is this is  a race that you run completely alone
l2EvNXWCXpE,295440,303599,and you're all by yourself  [Music]  growth only comes to pain
l2EvNXWCXpE,303680,308840,that which you do not hate you will  eventually tolerate  and  i think that
l2EvNXWCXpE,308840,314639,identifies most people's lives in other  words they  average becomes sort of like this slow
l2EvNXWCXpE,314639,320800,asphyxiation it's almost like an  anesthetic and that over time we become  kind of immune and dulled to the average
l2EvNXWCXpE,320800,326080,that we're becoming  your life doesn't have meaning without  aspiration or name okay so you need a
l2EvNXWCXpE,326080,332880,hierarchy of values there's got to be  something at the top it's got to be  something important if you don't have  that your life doesn't have any meaning
l2EvNXWCXpE,332880,340240,so if you criticize the hierarchy or  even the ideas of idea of hierarchy you  destroy the idea of aspiration and then
l2EvNXWCXpE,340240,347440,people have nothing  this is i believe the single biggest
l2EvNXWCXpE,347440,353520,factor  for most people that robs them of  success that you use what other people
l2EvNXWCXpE,353520,359120,might say or think or be disappointed by  as an excuse
l2EvNXWCXpE,359120,364160,to not fully be yourself to not fully go  after what you want
l2EvNXWCXpE,364160,370560,you're going to get out of your life  what you'll accept that's really  difficult for people i think to  understand is look what you think you're  worth and what you're going to tolerate
l2EvNXWCXpE,370560,375919,is absolutely what you're going to bring  into your life and what the outward part  of your life's going to look like
l2EvNXWCXpE,375919,381680,no there's two motivators right there's  the gaining of pleasure right wanting to  go get something chasing the dream but
l2EvNXWCXpE,381680,384960,then there's the avoidance of pain
l2EvNXWCXpE,387830,394479,[Music]  i'm great we surround ourselves
l2EvNXWCXpE,394479,401120,around people that make us feel great  they tell us what we want to hear the  second we put ourselves amongst the
l2EvNXWCXpE,401120,407199,uncommon people  we don't like that feeling we like that  person who says hey you know what man i
l2EvNXWCXpE,407199,413680,don't feel good today man and they say  oh it's okay brother  [Music]  we don't want that in our lives we don't
l2EvNXWCXpE,413680,419360,want that person who's constantly  challenging our weaknesses  we want that person's constantly you
l2EvNXWCXpE,419360,426479,know making us feel nice and good and  secure in ours that's the mediocrity of  life  we want to be the best amongst the
l2EvNXWCXpE,426479,432479,average people  [Music]  if you don't develop your capabilities
l2EvNXWCXpE,432479,438080,and realize your potential you may be  successful  externally
l2EvNXWCXpE,438080,444479,but you will be deeply unhappy because  you're not fulfilling your gifts your  nature
l2EvNXWCXpE,444479,452319,and so that's what the way that's done  is bottom up each person  discovering their gift
l2EvNXWCXpE,452319,457919,turning it into valued skills and then  using it to succeed by contributing
l2EvNXWCXpE,457919,464639,but one's career  is infinite  there's no end it's like our lives are
l2EvNXWCXpE,464639,471199,finite but life is infinite people come  and people go but life continues they  spend their whole life working for one
l2EvNXWCXpE,471199,477199,goal though most will never get it the  few that do  don't know what to do next because their
l2EvNXWCXpE,477199,482240,goals were finite  their goals were finite
l2EvNXWCXpE,482240,490560,and so  there are finite components to your  career  but your career should be infinite
l2EvNXWCXpE,490560,496400,so yes of course you have to win the  finite game you have to get the part but  immediately when you get the part now
l2EvNXWCXpE,496400,502319,you convert to infinite  so the monkey mind is jumping from
l2EvNXWCXpE,502319,508960,bronze to branch it doesn't want to  focus on the root of the issue  it wants to find the next banana it
l2EvNXWCXpE,508960,515760,wants to find the next excuse it wants  to find the next instant gratification  right that's the monkey mind and so the
l2EvNXWCXpE,515760,522800,monkey mind is never going to help you  focus on your strengths the reason why  we struggle to find our passion
l2EvNXWCXpE,522800,529120,is because the world has constantly  pushed us away from our strength we've  constantly told to focus on your
l2EvNXWCXpE,529120,532120,weaknesses
l2EvNXWCXpE,534399,539519,and so we've all been programmed to say  oh your strengths are they're fine  they're good the way they are but why
l2EvNXWCXpE,539519,544880,are you not performing at this  and so the one way to know your  strengths
l2EvNXWCXpE,544880,550959,is to ask yourself what do you do that  you feel the most confidence doing
l2EvNXWCXpE,550959,557120,when you get tired when you get fatigued  when you get down when you're in a slump  it's your habits rituals routines and
l2EvNXWCXpE,557120,563600,your standards that carry you through if  you don't have good habits you don't  have good rituals you don't have good  routines always in your life you will
l2EvNXWCXpE,563600,568560,fall down in bad times and slumps and  fatigue and stress
l2EvNXWCXpE,572640,578720,so you want to be normal  so you just want to be like everybody
l2EvNXWCXpE,578720,585600,else that roams the world  not knowing the power that's in them  being fine with being mediocre
l2EvNXWCXpE,585600,590790,i see a whole bunch of people walking  around out here  who have no idea how talented they truly  are
l2EvNXWCXpE,590790,593889,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,602000,607200,he wrote deep is the hunger  the voice of the genuine
l2EvNXWCXpE,607200,613279,the centering moment one of the things  that i can just tell you as you think  about your goals and dreams
l2EvNXWCXpE,613279,620320,all of us can say in a spirit of  integrity that it's possible that if  anybody at any point in time live their
l2EvNXWCXpE,620320,625120,dream then it's possible that i can live  my
l2EvNXWCXpE,625920,631519,all i want you to ever do is try  that's it
l2EvNXWCXpE,631519,638560,i just want you to try in those moments  where you hear yourself i want you to  try in those moments where you know that
l2EvNXWCXpE,638560,645440,it's time to speak up i want you to try  that's all that i ever ask of you  because if you simply do that
l2EvNXWCXpE,645440,651839,and i say simply as if it's so easy  right  you will literally unlock the potential
l2EvNXWCXpE,651839,658240,of your life  you have asked am i able to turn this
l2EvNXWCXpE,658240,664240,fantasy of mine into a fact can i  actually realize it can i turn my dreams
l2EvNXWCXpE,664240,670079,into reality  now you're either going to say yes i'm  able to or no i'm not if you realize you
l2EvNXWCXpE,670079,675600,are able if you have an understanding of  this potential this power within you  then you have to ask yourself are you
l2EvNXWCXpE,675600,681839,willing and there's a long series of  tests there you don't even know what  you're going to come up against one
l2EvNXWCXpE,681839,688640,thing is for certain you'll come up  against ridicule  you have to be willing to do whatever is
l2EvNXWCXpE,688640,694079,required if you really want to turn your  fantasy into a fact
l2EvNXWCXpE,694079,701320,the second you say yes i'm willing at  that instant you've created your theory
l2EvNXWCXpE,708560,718190,so  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,720410,731868,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,734470,748009,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,751760,761459,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,769610,774079,[Music]  what if
l2EvNXWCXpE,776800,782510,body's broken mind's broken spirit's  broken  i started to say what if i can pull this  off
l2EvNXWCXpE,782510,789360,[Music]  it's the what if  i can pull off a miracle
l2EvNXWCXpE,789360,795200,what if i can become someone that no one  thinks i can be  everyone knows
l2EvNXWCXpE,795200,800399,that you wake up at three in the morning  when you let your life go off the rails
l2EvNXWCXpE,800399,805600,the decisions you make right now is up  to you  you crying about something that happened
l2EvNXWCXpE,805600,810000,to you when you was a kid you ain't even  no kid no more
l2EvNXWCXpE,813120,820000,the hard thing is taking the first step  everything else  is just persistence  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,820000,826240,so what i want you to understand about  the breakthrough  is that 90
l2EvNXWCXpE,826240,832000,is worth  but the last 10  that's fight
l2EvNXWCXpE,832000,837920,you commit to do this for the long term  whether it's hard or easy doesn't matter
l2EvNXWCXpE,837920,844399,you're doing this  i tell you to set goals beyond your  lifetime
l2EvNXWCXpE,844399,849920,i i tell you to set goals as soon as  humanly possible
l2EvNXWCXpE,851600,856720,you will never exceed your highest  expectation  you will never exceed your highest
l2EvNXWCXpE,856720,862079,craziest thought that's a guarantee  and so then why
l2EvNXWCXpE,862079,868839,to set low goals  [Music]  every tool you
l2EvNXWCXpE,868839,877120,have and most people will not use every  single tool they have
l2EvNXWCXpE,877600,885060,because they're afraid they don't know  how to control it they don't want to  acknowledge it they're afraid of being  judged they want to stand out
l2EvNXWCXpE,885060,892320,[Music]  they want to be different  they want women to acknowledge them
l2EvNXWCXpE,892720,899839,but they have so much doubt  [Applause]  of what greatness
l2EvNXWCXpE,899839,905040,and the unforgiving race actually  requires
l2EvNXWCXpE,905040,911600,to win over and over again we all have  fear  we all have fear but these individuals
l2EvNXWCXpE,911600,916720,have so much doubt  think about the times
l2EvNXWCXpE,916720,922320,where  everything was going wrong  nothing was going right
l2EvNXWCXpE,922320,927839,what kept you going  what kept you going you were in that
l2EvNXWCXpE,927839,935920,place  what  kept you going  that was your dark energy
l2EvNXWCXpE,936320,942079,when does a new day start  at midnight if a new day
l2EvNXWCXpE,942079,950600,starts in the dark  why are you afraid to have use your dark  side for your new beginnings
l2EvNXWCXpE,961839,968560,we tell ourselves the story we play the  only part we've ever known and then that  part becomes our own and we don't know
l2EvNXWCXpE,968560,975440,how to separate it  [Music]  so we understand praise manipulates will
l2EvNXWCXpE,975440,981040,accept your own praise your mind says if  you say it it must be true which is why
l2EvNXWCXpE,981040,986560,self-criticism goes in and does so much  damage and self-praise goes in
l2EvNXWCXpE,986560,994000,and does so much repairing because the  most  important word you'll ever hear are the  words you say to yourself
l2EvNXWCXpE,994000,1001040,you have too many individuals out there  that are not writing their own story
l2EvNXWCXpE,1001040,1008360,they're letting other people  write  those stories for them
l2EvNXWCXpE,1011199,1016240,so the first thing is that's the first  big problem right there first big  problem is that you have put a lot of
l2EvNXWCXpE,1016240,1022079,people above you put no one above you no  one  and how many times have we given up on a
l2EvNXWCXpE,1022079,1028720,dream because we were mocked by the  people around you and all i'm suggesting  to you is when you get laughed at  ridiculed and when people don't
l2EvNXWCXpE,1028720,1034079,understand your next level of world  class  that just means you've got a great dream
l2EvNXWCXpE,1034079,1039360,and that just means you're on the path  of growth  but momentum requires you always do the
l2EvNXWCXpE,1039360,1046959,next thing to keep the momentum going  and the reason  you get yourself in a passionate place
l2EvNXWCXpE,1046959,1053640,is so that you change your life and the  only thing that changes your life is  making a decision
l2EvNXWCXpE,1057450,1063600,[Music]  and  nothing will happen in this world  everything will happen wonderfully well
l2EvNXWCXpE,1063600,1069039,even if you're not there  every human being should be aware of  this every moment of his life
l2EvNXWCXpE,1069039,1075840,it does not matter  what the whole world says about you it  does not matter how significant the work
l2EvNXWCXpE,1075840,1080960,you're doing you must understand  that tomorrow morning the world will go
l2EvNXWCXpE,1080960,1086559,on fine without you whoever you make  if you constantly remind yourself of
l2EvNXWCXpE,1086559,1092240,this  you'll have no reason to be serious  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1092240,1098080,everything i didn't want to do  is what got me to where i'm at today  every single thing so
l2EvNXWCXpE,1098080,1103280,where we find comfort that's where i  started getting scared when i started  saying oh it's raining i'm not going out
l2EvNXWCXpE,1103280,1108480,there no you cannot say that  you cannot do that you you have got to
l2EvNXWCXpE,1108480,1113520,do this  so while you're in this passionate state
l2EvNXWCXpE,1113520,1118949,that's where you make decisions  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1119919,1126320,if you make a decision in a state  without momentum if you make a decision  from a place where there's no passion
l2EvNXWCXpE,1126320,1132400,you are not going to get momentum it'll  kill momentum it's decide  commit
l2EvNXWCXpE,1132400,1139120,and resolve  truly that you make things happen so  that the person you are starting
l2EvNXWCXpE,1139120,1144440,tomorrow is more of who you know you  truly are
l2EvNXWCXpE,1144910,1148049,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1152160,1158000,most individuals your mind  will make a decision  say we're going to we're going to do
l2EvNXWCXpE,1158000,1164730,this  your feelings always make suggestions  [Music]  when you fail
l2EvNXWCXpE,1164730,1172720,[Music]  your feelings  give you excuses
l2EvNXWCXpE,1172720,1178559,your mind makes you more resilient  there are things that you know
l2EvNXWCXpE,1178559,1185440,that you must focus on but it scares you  i want you to look at where in your life
l2EvNXWCXpE,1185440,1190960,that story is robbing you of your dreams  and where it is giving you an excuse to
l2EvNXWCXpE,1190960,1196240,avoid the things that you know you need  to do  people will point out your weaknesses
l2EvNXWCXpE,1196240,1203440,but there's a big difference between  your weaknesses and your flaws  your flaws are your gifts and people are
l2EvNXWCXpE,1203440,1209039,so busy trying to deal with their flaws  and change their flaws when their flaws
l2EvNXWCXpE,1209039,1215679,are actually allows them to stay in that  race  everyone's good at something you know
l2EvNXWCXpE,1215679,1221440,you're not meant to be good at  everything it's no good being a jack of  all trades and a master of none so
l2EvNXWCXpE,1221440,1228480,be really good at what you're good at  and don't worry about what you're not  good at because we're not all supposed  to be good at the same thing
l2EvNXWCXpE,1228480,1235280,find your talent you know find out what  you love to do what you're meant to do  lies directly behind and is absolutely
l2EvNXWCXpE,1235280,1239559,linked to what you love to do
l2EvNXWCXpE,1241920,1246949,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1250550,1256640,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1256640,1267809,so  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1280480,1286559,[Music]  i tell all the people that i love
l2EvNXWCXpE,1286559,1292480,you gotta want the best out of your life  for you because we only have a moan on  this earth
l2EvNXWCXpE,1292480,1298880,and it's going to be people  that look you in the face and tell you  that they believe in you
l2EvNXWCXpE,1298880,1304320,they're going to tell you from their  lips they believe in you  but when you look them in their eyes  you're going to know that they're not
l2EvNXWCXpE,1304320,1310720,telling the truth  that's the hardest thing for a man  to take

l2EvNXWCXpE,1348480,1354880,the world becomes disneyland  problems become scratches
l2EvNXWCXpE,1356240,1361760,many people focus on the problem  and not solutions
l2EvNXWCXpE,1361760,1367360,we spend a split second 15 20 minutes  tearing our body down
l2EvNXWCXpE,1367360,1374960,tearing our mind down  over something that we can't control  everybody talks about their faith
l2EvNXWCXpE,1374960,1382640,but do they really got faith  do you got that halfway faith or do you  got that whole way
l2EvNXWCXpE,1383110,1388720,[Music]  real motivation come from pain it comes
l2EvNXWCXpE,1388720,1395200,from the bottle  building yourself begins with intention  clarity you have to know who you want to
l2EvNXWCXpE,1395200,1401360,become  you can't just show up in the gym of the  mind and do random stuff any more then
l2EvNXWCXpE,1401360,1406480,you can show up in the gym of the body  and do random stuff and think you're  gonna end up on the stage
l2EvNXWCXpE,1406480,1411919,competing for mr olympia  because until you know exactly in what
l2EvNXWCXpE,1411919,1417039,way you are trying to serve people you  don't know what skills you need to
l2EvNXWCXpE,1417039,1423440,acquire in order to lead people in awe  so that you may become extraordinary
l2EvNXWCXpE,1425600,1431600,you have to push yourself long past the  point of boredom boredom kills more  people in the pursuit of success than
l2EvNXWCXpE,1431600,1439278,any hater will ever kill  boredom is the great killer of dreams
l2EvNXWCXpE,1441279,1447039,boredom  because people don't have the focus they  don't have the clarity of what they're
l2EvNXWCXpE,1447039,1452400,trying to achieve they've not built into  their life built into their life an
l2EvNXWCXpE,1452400,1457799,intoxication for what they're trying to  accomplish
l2EvNXWCXpE,1458799,1464559,why is it so many people have big dreams  but such a small number of people ever  make those dreams a reality and for
l2EvNXWCXpE,1464559,1470640,those that do make a reality what is it  that gets them not only to follow  through  but then to enjoy what they have
l2EvNXWCXpE,1470640,1476720,i don't know if you've ever had the  experience of achieving something that  you've always wanted and then afterwards  thinking to yourself
l2EvNXWCXpE,1476720,1482159,is this all there is it's one of the  worst feelings the worst it's almost  worse than failing because when you fail
l2EvNXWCXpE,1482159,1487360,at least you know hey i can still find a  way to make it happen but when you  succeed and you're not happy you're not
l2EvNXWCXpE,1487360,1493039,fulfilled then you got a real problem  there's two things that control  everything in your life
l2EvNXWCXpE,1493039,1500240,every thought every feeling every  emotion every action you have in your  life your beliefs and your values
l2EvNXWCXpE,1500240,1505520,whatever you believe if you think life  is just a waste of time doesn't matter  what you do
l2EvNXWCXpE,1505520,1511200,beliefs control us but so do our values  some people value making it happen some
l2EvNXWCXpE,1511200,1516799,people value their family the most some  people value love but you know what the  real challenge is we have values in
l2EvNXWCXpE,1516799,1519278,conflict
l2EvNXWCXpE,1523679,1529120,when we have conflicts between what we  want and what we think we can have or  you know you have a goal of what you
l2EvNXWCXpE,1529120,1536480,really want to make happen but then you  have this other belief inside that says  this damn stuff never does work
l2EvNXWCXpE,1537520,1542880,but then there's a time in which people  begin to question  they begin to look at their life and  they begin to say
l2EvNXWCXpE,1542880,1548720,is this really what i want  have you found yourself with that at any  time and then they do one of two things
l2EvNXWCXpE,1548720,1554559,they either recommit and they go for  another seven years and they take it to  another level or they make a strategic
l2EvNXWCXpE,1554559,1560000,decision that shifts the direction of  their life  either way your decisions control your  destiny
l2EvNXWCXpE,1560000,1565039,and if you don't choose that's a choice  as well some people just kind of stay in  the middle of that lukewarm place not
l2EvNXWCXpE,1565039,1570720,sure what not sure what they really want  maybe the question to ask is
l2EvNXWCXpE,1570720,1576559,where do i want my life to be today  and where am i really going  what is my destiny what's going to fill
l2EvNXWCXpE,1576559,1583520,me up what's going to give me the  meaning for my life that's going to give  me joy in my life not just achievement  but real enjoyment a sense of meaning
l2EvNXWCXpE,1583520,1588559,and aliveness  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1588559,1594080,every human being on this earth has  their own  journey
l2EvNXWCXpE,1594080,1599679,and when you don't focus on yours you  will not bring the great gifts and  things that you were supposed to bring
l2EvNXWCXpE,1599679,1605360,to the world  like the best gift come from the bottom
l2EvNXWCXpE,1605360,1610480,like only in the womb of a woman can a  man breathe underwater
l2EvNXWCXpE,1610960,1616559,like god leaves you give at the bottom  of the stairs and it's up to you to  climb up those stairs
l2EvNXWCXpE,1616559,1623600,and get your gift  [Music]  you get to build yourself in any
l2EvNXWCXpE,1623600,1630799,direction you want in any way to become  anything you want
l2EvNXWCXpE,1631360,1639880,there will be an extraordinary price to  pay  but you can go in any direction

l2EvNXWCXpE,1655520,1661200,when i say you're immortal you're not  actually thinking you're immortal but  you're not conscious of your morality
l2EvNXWCXpE,1661200,1666240,mortality  if you're not conscious of your  mortality somewhere you think you're
l2EvNXWCXpE,1666240,1672210,immortal isn't it how many moments in a  day are you conscious that you're mortal
l2EvNXWCXpE,1672210,1678399,[Music]  if you just become conscious of this one  thing
l2EvNXWCXpE,1678399,1683600,that always you're conscious that i am  mortal  just you know one day i will die if you
l2EvNXWCXpE,1683600,1689279,just conscious of this one thing  you will naturally become spiritual  every day every moment if you remind
l2EvNXWCXpE,1689279,1696440,yourself this is a brief life  i motto  one day i will end
l2EvNXWCXpE,1697919,1703760,that's all that's needed  if you want to know  the value of life
l2EvNXWCXpE,1703760,1708360,just know that it's a brief happening
l2EvNXWCXpE,1710320,1715919,i think people give up because they  don't believe what they see
l2EvNXWCXpE,1717120,1721840,people don't believe the greatness  that's in it
l2EvNXWCXpE,1723039,1729200,and the real reason is  most people never get out the stands and  get in the game
l2EvNXWCXpE,1729200,1732880,they stay fans that whole life
l2EvNXWCXpE,1734880,1740320,so i tell everybody get off the stands  and get in the game
l2EvNXWCXpE,1742000,1748060,get in the game of life  and leave your mark here

l2EvNXWCXpE,1783039,1788880,because i wouldn't assemble the story  that my past equals my future the past  only includes your future if you live
l2EvNXWCXpE,1788880,1795039,there if you're using a rear view mirror  to guide yourself you're gonna crash  so what you've been through is horrific
l2EvNXWCXpE,1795039,1800480,what you've been through is unjust  i'm on your side  but if you hang on to it you have no
l2EvNXWCXpE,1800480,1806559,future and you have no one to blame but  yourself  free yourself
l2EvNXWCXpE,1806559,1812159,from  the chains of your past  in other words the minute you begin to
l2EvNXWCXpE,1812159,1817840,get external in your life worrying about  what other people think about you right  you've out you've lost all control you
l2EvNXWCXpE,1817840,1824240,and it never fills you up and people's  admiration people's gratitude towards  you will never fill you up it's your own
l2EvNXWCXpE,1824240,1830240,it's your own inside  you have a lot of potential as a child  but none of that is capable of
l2EvNXWCXpE,1830240,1836559,manifesting itself as freedom before you  become disciplined  and discipline is a matter of the  imposition of order and the order is
l2EvNXWCXpE,1836559,1841760,necessary especially for people who are  hopeless and nihilistic  and lots of people are hopeless and
l2EvNXWCXpE,1841760,1848840,nihilistic way more people than you  think and part of that is because no  one's ever really encouraged
l2EvNXWCXpE,1848840,1855039,them your life you're probably never  going to exceed your identity  your identity is the thoughts and
l2EvNXWCXpE,1855039,1861039,concepts that you believe to hold really  to be true about yourself  it is so easy to get lost in the
l2EvNXWCXpE,1861039,1868080,day-to-day grind of what you do what any  of us do  if at the core ivy is a deep and
l2EvNXWCXpE,1868080,1873600,unending why for what you're doing  you've got something  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1873600,1878720,now you've got a chance  to transcend what you're doing
l2EvNXWCXpE,1878720,1883760,because if you want joy happiness and  freedom and extraordinary life it will  not come from blame
l2EvNXWCXpE,1883760,1890000,never  there's no pride that comes from blame  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1890000,1897840,that's why your self-esteem self-esteem  does not come from what people say about  you  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1897840,1905680,self-esteem comes from what you  experience about yourself  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,1921120,1928559,it's a complete  dynamic dance  between  what the vedic tradition would call fate
l2EvNXWCXpE,1928559,1933679,and free will so fate is what is already  created for you
l2EvNXWCXpE,1933679,1939360,and a good example would be the place  you were born  at the type of family you grew up in the
l2EvNXWCXpE,1939360,1944960,socio-economic background you had it was  already there when you walked in to the  world
l2EvNXWCXpE,1944960,1951840,but within that you had choices where  your free will came over  you had the choice to either do what
l2EvNXWCXpE,1951840,1957279,everyone in your neighborhood did or to  do something different you had the  choice
l2EvNXWCXpE,1957279,1963279,to have a relationship with a particular  person or not so what happens is that  we're constantly creating
l2EvNXWCXpE,1963279,1968320,new spaces from which we have another  choice  and so you kind of see as this dynamic
l2EvNXWCXpE,1968320,1974240,dance  between okay now i'm in this situation  and now what is my choice in this
l2EvNXWCXpE,1974240,1980960,situation so i would say i'm not saying  it's equal i'm saying it's a dynamic  balance and a switching process
l2EvNXWCXpE,1980960,1986130,where you're constantly creating a new  level and then now in that level you  have a next choice
l2EvNXWCXpE,1986130,1992399,[Music]  first you're in service to something  higher and you begin to ask yourself
l2EvNXWCXpE,1992399,1998640,because you've been given everything  you're a composite spiritual idea that  carries the infinite and ways beyond
l2EvNXWCXpE,1998640,2005679,your wildest imagining you have to live  in the inquiry of what can i give what  can i share how can i shine how can i
l2EvNXWCXpE,2005679,2010880,radiate you you have to give up the  thought of what can i get from the world
l2EvNXWCXpE,2010880,2016240,the world has nothing for you at all  there is nothing the world has for you
l2EvNXWCXpE,2016240,2022480,other than an opportunity for you to  give for you to share for you to serve  for you to radiate for you to activate
l2EvNXWCXpE,2022480,2031279,your potential  but if you just do your vision  every single day putting one foot in
l2EvNXWCXpE,2031279,2036960,front of the other committed to your  desires
l2EvNXWCXpE,2037519,2045440,instead of lack limitation fear don't  worry separation not enoughness your  narrative becomes i have everything that
l2EvNXWCXpE,2045440,2053520,i need within me  i am surrendered to something larger  than my little self i'm in service to it
l2EvNXWCXpE,2053520,2059358,that flows through me  where fear is physical
l2EvNXWCXpE,2059358,2065679,you feel your throat your gut so it's  courage courage doesn't mean you're not  afraid it just means you're strong  enough you push through in spite of the
l2EvNXWCXpE,2065679,2071520,fear right and courage feels different  in the body so when you go lift or you  go for a sprint or a strong run or you
l2EvNXWCXpE,2071520,2077200,jump in that freezing water when you  push your mind to go beyond what's  comfortable you feel a strength inside
l2EvNXWCXpE,2077200,2082480,you and that strength will help you to  change your body your emotions  relationships  and there's lots of different purposes
l2EvNXWCXpE,2082480,2088878,as you go through your life but most  people try to get back they already  figured out what the hell they're going  to do they haven't even figured out  enjoy their life
l2EvNXWCXpE,2088878,2095000,your purpose will unfold  if you do the right things
l2EvNXWCXpE,2096658,2103879,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,2110740,2116320,[Music]  it's a hard one for people because we're
l2EvNXWCXpE,2116320,2121839,we grow up believing that we're not good  enough and  nothing is right when you talk about
l2EvNXWCXpE,2121839,2126960,loving yourself a lot of people think  that that's vanity
l2EvNXWCXpE,2126960,2133680,if you can recognize that you are a  being that has self-worth  if you can really recognize your own
l2EvNXWCXpE,2133680,2140880,worth then you start to treat yourself  differently and i think that's what's so  very important about loving yourself is
l2EvNXWCXpE,2140880,2147920,you stop beating yourself up you stop  making yourself wrong you stop talking  about how awful you are
l2EvNXWCXpE,2147920,2155359,and you start to treat yourself with a  certain amount of respect and this makes  an enormous difference because what you
l2EvNXWCXpE,2155359,2160480,give out in life is what comes back to  you
l2EvNXWCXpE,2161280,2166960,so if you're giving out a feeling of i'm  okay i'm good enough as i am and i am
l2EvNXWCXpE,2166960,2172720,acceptable and i love life and i love me  and you start having gratitude for
l2EvNXWCXpE,2172720,2178680,yourself and for life then life treats  you differently

l2EvNXWCXpE,2205280,2214089,so  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,2216930,2220040,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,2277200,2283359,it's good for you to go take your place  in the world have some ambition have  some have a vision have a goal have a
l2EvNXWCXpE,2283359,2288640,strategy try to try to be a good person  and not not because it's your duty
l2EvNXWCXpE,2288640,2294480,precisely because that's the proper way  to live we're in danger of undermining  all of that and it's not good for people
l2EvNXWCXpE,2294480,2303420,one of the things that i've really  learned for example recently is that  there's a very tight relationship  between aspiration and responsibility
l2EvNXWCXpE,2303420,2309520,[Music]  this is this is what i mean by living  our lives by accident which is we
l2EvNXWCXpE,2309520,2315359,largely lead the direction of our  careers and sometimes even our own  happiness to others our bosses you know
l2EvNXWCXpE,2315359,2321280,all of that thing  so what it means to live your life on  purpose means you understand the  direction you're heading but you remain
l2EvNXWCXpE,2321280,2328400,agnostic as to the root most people try  very very hard to plan the route and the  question is where are you going right
l2EvNXWCXpE,2328400,2333680,and that to me is what it means to have  purpose it means have destination that's  what it means to live a life of purpose
l2EvNXWCXpE,2333680,2338880,means i live every single day of my life  trying to get to an end point
l2EvNXWCXpE,2338880,2344880,getting what you really want  and being able to attract it into your  life
l2EvNXWCXpE,2345040,2353119,what  what we have to look at is basically the  obstacles  that we have conditioned ourselves
l2EvNXWCXpE,2353119,2358240,you notice i say that we have  conditioned ourselves  because i have never believed that we
l2EvNXWCXpE,2358240,2363440,need to be putting the responsibility on  someone else if you're conditioned it's  because you have allowed yourself to
l2EvNXWCXpE,2363440,2368560,become that  and if we are conditioned if we  conditioned ourselves to believe certain
l2EvNXWCXpE,2368560,2375599,kinds of things  and one of the things that we kind of  believe and hang on to and live with is
l2EvNXWCXpE,2375599,2380839,this whole idea that  all of the things that happened to me in  my
l2EvNXWCXpE,2380839,2386720,past are what are keeping me from doing  what i'd like to do today
l2EvNXWCXpE,2387839,2393200,there's two lies we've been told growing  up the first lie  is  you're nothing
l2EvNXWCXpE,2393200,2399599,you're stupid you're worthless you're  not gonna make it and i'm sure many  people listening or watching have heard  that from teachers parents aunts uncles
l2EvNXWCXpE,2399599,2404880,whoever it is and then the other lie  that we're actually told and i don't  think it's a lie i think it's positive
l2EvNXWCXpE,2404880,2411760,but sometimes it's misconstrued  is you can be  anything and and we all know that's not
l2EvNXWCXpE,2411760,2418480,true too and and it's unfair because  sometimes people get misled and the  dharma point of view is you can't be
l2EvNXWCXpE,2418480,2425599,anything you want  but you can be everything you are and  what i mean by that is you have a genius
l2EvNXWCXpE,2425599,2430800,a potential a power inside of you that  you don't know yet why because you're
l2EvNXWCXpE,2430800,2437119,inexperienced it's not that you're  unqualified it's your inexperience so  people are saying i'm stuck i don't know
l2EvNXWCXpE,2437119,2443839,where my life's going i don't know my  purpose is so you're perceiving yourself  to be unqualified or under-qualified
l2EvNXWCXpE,2443839,2450720,actually you're just inexperienced you  just haven't done enough things  to let the magnet of your life tell you
l2EvNXWCXpE,2450720,2455920,what it's attracted to  keep this in mind if there's something
l2EvNXWCXpE,2455920,2461760,that you want keep in mind this  here you are  this is what you want i spend a lot of
l2EvNXWCXpE,2461760,2466800,time on lacrosse fields although they  don't really look like this  you tend to think that what you want you
l2EvNXWCXpE,2466800,2471920,just march right towards it but if in  sports you march right towards the goal
l2EvNXWCXpE,2471920,2478400,what happens the defenders come in and  what the defenders are is it's your  brain saying ain't gonna happen so the
l2EvNXWCXpE,2478400,2484800,second you start moving toward that  thing you want be ready you're gonna  tell yourself you don't feel like it  you're gonna have to force yourself it's
l2EvNXWCXpE,2484800,2490480,happening there's no way to get around  it so what you're gonna have to do is  you're gonna basically get bounced
l2EvNXWCXpE,2490480,2496720,around a lot  all over the place because it's going to  get hard
l2EvNXWCXpE,2496720,2502240,and i want to remind you about something  unlike a sports field where there's an
l2EvNXWCXpE,2502240,2507440,in and out of bounds  the great thing about life is there  actually aren't any
l2EvNXWCXpE,2507440,2514319,and it's usually in those moments where  you feel like you can't do it that  you're closer than ever to having
l2EvNXWCXpE,2514319,2517960,everything that you want

l2EvNXWCXpE,2528400,2534079,for me  passion is the result of something right  so if you work hard for something you
l2EvNXWCXpE,2534079,2541280,don't believe in that's called stress  and if you work for so hard for  something you do believe in that's  called passion so it's finding the
l2EvNXWCXpE,2541280,2548160,belief it's finding the cause it's  finding the purpose and the passion then  shows up so it's not about doing
l2EvNXWCXpE,2548160,2556319,something with passion and then finding  the cause it's finding the cause  starting with why and then the passion  is what is what results
l2EvNXWCXpE,2562319,2567680,you could live your life the way that  you want to live it that's a matter of  action
l2EvNXWCXpE,2567680,2574440,you know and they say actions speak  louder than words and one of the best  things you can possibly be is a
l2EvNXWCXpE,2574440,2579838,inspirational example  so that's not nothing
l2EvNXWCXpE,2588400,2594400,[Music]  to believe that you need what you don't
l2EvNXWCXpE,2594400,2600960,have is the definition of insanity  to believe that you need  what you don't have
l2EvNXWCXpE,2600960,2607760,because  you're already here so you've already  proven that you don't need it  so to go around believing that i can't
l2EvNXWCXpE,2607760,2613839,be  happy fulfilled you know whatever it is  unless i get the stuff that i don't  already have
l2EvNXWCXpE,2613839,2619119,it's a complete and total illusion it's  a it's a thought that isn't even true  there's no truth to it whatsoever you
l2EvNXWCXpE,2619119,2624319,don't need anything  and when you get that the irony is  you're no longer you're no longer
l2EvNXWCXpE,2624319,2630079,attached your your total life is about  it's just about living those virtues how
l2EvNXWCXpE,2630079,2635280,can i serve how can i be sincere how can  i be gentle how can i be supportive and
l2EvNXWCXpE,2635280,2642400,thinking like that and that's how i  think now and because of that i'm i'm in  meaning
l2EvNXWCXpE,2642720,2648079,what did you miss  you thought motivation was the formula  winners don't need motivation winners
l2EvNXWCXpE,2648079,2654480,need discipline  discipline's about getting it done  because it needs to get done not because  i feel like it
l2EvNXWCXpE,2654480,2661200,not because i'm motivated for it  you think nelson mandela is motivated to  spend 27 years in prison do you think
l2EvNXWCXpE,2661200,2667280,martin luther king was motivated to  march across the states and proclaim  freedom  if you look at people to change the
l2EvNXWCXpE,2667280,2674720,world they're not doing it because  they're motivated they're doing it  because they made a commitment to do it  and they disciplined to see it through
l2EvNXWCXpE,2674720,2680800,discipline is far more important than  motivation  which is why you've got to be careful  the decisions you make because once you  make that decision you have to see that
l2EvNXWCXpE,2680800,2687200,decision through  first we make the decisions then the  decisions make us  so gonna be very careful the decisions
l2EvNXWCXpE,2687200,2693760,you make be very careful the commitments  you make motivation i'm telling you now  is completely overrated
l2EvNXWCXpE,2693760,2699520,it's important don't get me wrong  you know we meet according to motivation  we feel good rah-rah
l2EvNXWCXpE,2699520,2705580,but that'll fade  you need a stronger will and a deeper  commitment to see things through
l2EvNXWCXpE,2705580,2710720,[Music]  people are built for a struggle and
l2EvNXWCXpE,2710720,2716560,they're built for a weight and you want  to take on a heavy burden voluntarily  see if you can put yourself together see
l2EvNXWCXpE,2716560,2722640,what you can do out in the world while  you're waiting to die it's an all-in  game it better be worthwhile
l2EvNXWCXpE,2722640,2730519,and so there's a tight relationship  between responsibility and aspiration  and hierarchy
l2EvNXWCXpE,2734400,2741839,this is the secret  you must remember  you can't make a mistake
l2EvNXWCXpE,2741839,2746520,now that's a very difficult thing to do
l2EvNXWCXpE,2747040,2754000,because from childhood up  we have had to conform to a certain  social game
l2EvNXWCXpE,2754000,2759440,and if you're going to conform to this  game you can make mistakes  or not make mistakes
l2EvNXWCXpE,2759440,2764640,you must do the right thing there's a  certain conduct appropriate here a  certain conduct appropriate there
l2EvNXWCXpE,2764640,2770560,and that sticks in us  everybody has a reason to be anxious in
l2EvNXWCXpE,2770560,2778000,fact we have the ultimate reason to be  anxious because we know that we're  vulnerable and we know that we're going  to die and how you can not be anxious
l2EvNXWCXpE,2778000,2785040,under those circumstances is a great  mystery it's a massive mystery  that's actually the appropriate response
l2EvNXWCXpE,2785040,2790319,in the face of actual non-naive  understanding of what constitutes life  like if you're naive and you move
l2EvNXWCXpE,2790319,2796960,forward it's like well what the hell do  you know  there's no courage in naivety because  you don't know what there is to
l2EvNXWCXpE,2796960,2802640,stop you you don't know what dangers you  might apprehend  and then to make the decision to move
l2EvNXWCXpE,2802640,2808400,forward into the unknown and the land of  the stranger anyways that's the i would  say that's one of the secrets to a good
l2EvNXWCXpE,2808400,2814560,life  and if you are in a field  by yourself  with
l2EvNXWCXpE,2814560,2819839,no clothes no possessions no trophies  absolutely nothing just you by yourself
l2EvNXWCXpE,2819839,2827720,you're enough  that's it you're enough you always have  been and you always will be no matter  what
l2EvNXWCXpE,2831599,2837680,i think that's important too  that it's not just you enough it's you  always have been
l2EvNXWCXpE,2837680,2843520,and you always will  [Music]  but there's a there is a balance between
l2EvNXWCXpE,2843520,2848800,the mindset of achieving  and
l2EvNXWCXpE,2848800,2855200,loving kindness  but it's really hard to get people to
l2EvNXWCXpE,2855200,2861040,let go  of the attack and defend  achievement mindset
l2EvNXWCXpE,2861040,2866240,and trust  the care and concern  for
l2EvNXWCXpE,2866240,2873240,your fellow humans as a way of creating  higher production
l2EvNXWCXpE,2873440,2880400,if you get braver that's not what  happens what happens is yeah the damn  world's just as dangerous as i thought  or maybe it's even more dangerous than i
l2EvNXWCXpE,2880400,2886240,thought but it turns out that there's  something in me that responds to taking  that on as a voluntary challenge and
l2EvNXWCXpE,2886240,2891440,grows and thrives as a consequence  and so once you've embraced and decided
l2EvNXWCXpE,2891440,2898800,that this suffering this sacrifice  you're making is an indicator of  progress it's an indicator of obsession
l2EvNXWCXpE,2898800,2904400,suffering and sacrifice and hard work  is an indication of progress towards our
l2EvNXWCXpE,2904400,2910720,dreams  [Music]  storms always end
l2EvNXWCXpE,2910720,2918480,fierce winds don't blow all morning  a downpour of rain doesn't last all day
l2EvNXWCXpE,2918480,2924640,who does this  heaven and earth  you're already connected to everything
l2EvNXWCXpE,2924640,2930000,you want or need  it will come to you at the exact perfect
l2EvNXWCXpE,2930000,2935200,time as the rivers and the streams come  to the ocean at the perfect time and
l2EvNXWCXpE,2935200,2938200,place
l2EvNXWCXpE,2940470,2945760,[Music]  the way  to visualize properly is to visualize
l2EvNXWCXpE,2945760,2951440,the bridge  between where you are  and where you need to go  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,2951440,2956640,what you do by visualizing the bridge is  you train your nervous system
l2EvNXWCXpE,2956640,2963520,and your mind  to do the hard work  why go on
l2EvNXWCXpE,2964079,2968720,and you only go on if the game is worth  the candle
l2EvNXWCXpE,2969680,2975119,now the universe has been going on for  an incredible long time
l2EvNXWCXpE,2976160,2981839,and so really a satisfactory theory of  the universe has to be one that's worth
l2EvNXWCXpE,2981839,2986880,betting on  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,2986880,2994319,because the fear is the most subtle  and destructive  of all human diseases
l2EvNXWCXpE,2994319,3000720,ladies and gentlemen fear  kills dreams  fear kills hope
l2EvNXWCXpE,3000720,3005920,fear  fear can aid you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3005920,3011359,fear ladies and gentlemen  can hold you back from doing something  that you know within yourself that
l2EvNXWCXpE,3011359,3016480,you're capable of doing but it will  paralyze you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3017040,3024160,and it seems like you're in a hypnotic  spell  what's it feel like when you wake up and
l2EvNXWCXpE,3024160,3031040,it is pouring rain and you visualize  yourself  running anyway
l2EvNXWCXpE,3031040,3037599,that way when you visualize the work  you are preparing your body for it so
l2EvNXWCXpE,3037599,3043440,you're not resistant to it when it comes  if you configure your life
l2EvNXWCXpE,3043440,3049760,so that what you are genuinely doing is  aiming at the highest possible good
l2EvNXWCXpE,3049760,3054960,then the things that you need to  to survive
l2EvNXWCXpE,3054960,3061040,and to thrive on a day-to-day basis will  deliver themselves to you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3061040,3067280,we play the games of  getting on top of things  all the time
l2EvNXWCXpE,3067280,3074480,and so we're in a constant state of  competition  [Music]  as to if it's not i'm stronger than you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3074480,3080079,it's i'm wiser than you i'm more loving  than you i'm more tolerant than you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3080079,3086240,i'm more sophisticated than you it  doesn't matter what it is but this  constant competition is going on
l2EvNXWCXpE,3086240,3092640,in terms of that competition we can of  course lose place  and in that sense make mistakes
l2EvNXWCXpE,3092640,3097920,but what a zen  student is  is a person
l2EvNXWCXpE,3097920,3103680,who is not involved in the status game  if you dare to do the most difficult
l2EvNXWCXpE,3103680,3111119,thing that you can conceptualize  your life will work out better than it  will if you do anything else
l2EvNXWCXpE,3111119,3117760,probability is that if you manifest  yourself properly in the world that  those things will come your way
l2EvNXWCXpE,3117760,3123280,effective way of operating in the world  than to conceptualize the highest good  that you can
l2EvNXWCXpE,3123280,3128880,and then strive to attain it  you know who you are
l2EvNXWCXpE,3129599,3136400,from the inside to the outside  and your behavior  is a demonstration
l2EvNXWCXpE,3136400,3141440,of what you believe to be true about you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3141440,3146960,i ask you a question what is the benefit  what's the benefit of allowing fear to
l2EvNXWCXpE,3146960,3152480,hold you back  what's the benefit  of giving up on yourself
l2EvNXWCXpE,3152480,3158360,of not stepping out on life and taking  life on what is the benefit for you  what's the plus of man
l2EvNXWCXpE,3158360,3164480,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,3164480,3170559,the same reason that people get stuck at  a certain level in life they can't see  things being better for them and they
l2EvNXWCXpE,3170559,3176720,think that this is it and this is all  they deserve this is all they've ever  seen it's been passed on to them and
l2EvNXWCXpE,3176720,3182799,they think that this is it for  them  oh no
l2EvNXWCXpE,3186240,3191119,if you want something what does it mean  to want it
l2EvNXWCXpE,3193680,3199039,and what it means is to sacrifice  whatever is necessary to get it
l2EvNXWCXpE,3199119,3207280,sometimes you need to feel the pain and  sting of defeat to activate the real  passion and purpose that god predestined
l2EvNXWCXpE,3207280,3214640,inside of you  you would rather find purpose
l2EvNXWCXpE,3214640,3220960,than a job or career  purpose crosses disciplines
l2EvNXWCXpE,3220960,3229520,purpose is an essential element of you  it is the reason you are on the planet  at this particular time in history
l2EvNXWCXpE,3230720,3236480,we've been told true life in our life  the first lie is
l2EvNXWCXpE,3236480,3242559,you're nothing  you're not worth anything
l2EvNXWCXpE,3242559,3248400,you haven't got anything that's the  first thing the second lie we've all  been told
l2EvNXWCXpE,3248400,3253599,is you can be anything  [Music]  it's a lie
l2EvNXWCXpE,3253599,3262480,it's not true  the way we're wired  defines what we can do with that wiring
l2EvNXWCXpE,3262480,3268880,and therefore the truth is  you can't be anything you want
l2EvNXWCXpE,3268880,3273989,but you can be everything you are  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,3276640,3280720,is to give up desiring as much as you  can
l2EvNXWCXpE,3282240,3286960,don't  want to go beyond the point
l2EvNXWCXpE,3287359,3292400,of which you're capable  not only is it the middle way between
l2EvNXWCXpE,3292400,3297520,the extremes of ascetic discipline  and pleasure seeking
l2EvNXWCXpE,3297520,3303520,but it's also the middle way in a very  subtle thing don't  desire
l2EvNXWCXpE,3303520,3309920,to give up more desire than you can  and if you find that a problem
l2EvNXWCXpE,3309920,3315760,don't desire  to  be successful
l2EvNXWCXpE,3315760,3320680,in giving up more desire than you can
l2EvNXWCXpE,3321160,3328079,[Music]  so if i had a gift to give you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3328079,3333839,it would be maybe make a different  decision the decision is  that no matter what happens in your life
l2EvNXWCXpE,3333839,3340319,you're going to live in a beautiful  state  a beautiful state and that could be  happy that could be grateful that could
l2EvNXWCXpE,3340319,3345760,be being generous those are all  beautiful states aren't they it could be  curious  it could be fun it could be playful
l2EvNXWCXpE,3345760,3351200,you're not limited to one state but it's  different than suffering  and most people's suffering and all
l2EvNXWCXpE,3351200,3356960,suffering i've ever seen suffering  always comes because you're obsessed  about something related to you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3356960,3364559,you can only be depressed if you're  focusing on yourself  the weeds are greed negativity
l2EvNXWCXpE,3364559,3370160,manipulation power control  so every day i'm literally gardening my
l2EvNXWCXpE,3370160,3375440,heart by pulling out every weed and  plucking out every weed that i no longer
l2EvNXWCXpE,3375440,3381520,want to plant in my house  because guess what weeds end up looking  like seeds
l2EvNXWCXpE,3381520,3388400,often in our life  the weeds and the seeds look exactly the  same when they start growing
l2EvNXWCXpE,3388400,3393520,and that's one of the biggest challenges  we're wired for generosity
l2EvNXWCXpE,3393520,3398640,but we're educated for greed  we're so deeply wired for generosity but
l2EvNXWCXpE,3398640,3403839,everything's trying to pull us away from  that  it's about you it's about how you think
l2EvNXWCXpE,3403839,3410079,you what you should have done or  shouldn't have done or what someone did  to you or didn't do to you  in the past or the future which don't
l2EvNXWCXpE,3410079,3416079,even exist so i have a simple goal my  goal is help people make a decision that  says i don't know what's going to happen
l2EvNXWCXpE,3416079,3421680,not positive thinking just the truth so  if that's going to happen i say make a  decision now that says i'm going to live
l2EvNXWCXpE,3421680,3427400,in a beautiful state and i'm going to  find beauty in whatever life brings me
l2EvNXWCXpE,3431850,3438010,[Music]  if it's meant for you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3438010,3444839,[Music]  i don't know what your future
l2EvNXWCXpE,3444839,3451839,is but if you're willing to take the  harder way  the more complicated one the one with
l2EvNXWCXpE,3451839,3457040,more failures at first their successes  the one that has ultimately proven to
l2EvNXWCXpE,3457040,3463090,have more meaning more  victory more glory then you will not  regret it
l2EvNXWCXpE,3463090,3469840,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,3471359,3477749,the light of new realization shines on  you today  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,3478799,3486160,but the challenges that you choose to  confront  as you commence to your past press on
l2EvNXWCXpE,3486160,3495000,with pride  and press on with purpose
l2EvNXWCXpE,3498470,3501540,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,3510140,3515440,[Music]  but the equation is something like
l2EvNXWCXpE,3515440,3520480,you don't want it unless you're willing  to sacrifice for it  and if you don't want it you're not
l2EvNXWCXpE,3520480,3525520,going to get it because you're scattered  but if you do want it and you make the
l2EvNXWCXpE,3525520,3531720,proper sacrifices then  god only knows what might happen
l2EvNXWCXpE,3532799,3537920,when you identify what you're good at  what you love your wiring your qualities
l2EvNXWCXpE,3537920,3544240,your values your skills your abilities  and you use that to make a difference in  the life of other people that's when
l2EvNXWCXpE,3544240,3549839,you're going to feel more most fulfilled  fulfillment is not just about doing good
l2EvNXWCXpE,3549839,3554960,it's about becoming better and then  doing good with what you have
l2EvNXWCXpE,3555760,3561520,because no one can demonstrate to you  that if you straighten yourself out and  aim at what you want and make the proper
l2EvNXWCXpE,3561520,3566960,sacrifices that your life will turn out  in the manner that you might want it to  turn out
l2EvNXWCXpE,3566960,3573920,it isn't in anyone else's  purview to make that judgment the only  person that can possibly figure that out
l2EvNXWCXpE,3573920,3580720,is you  it's something that can't be stolen from  you i would say it's your destiny it's a  destiny that cannot be stolen from you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3580720,3586640,and you can forego it  you can say well i'm not willing to put  in the effort because what if i fail
l2EvNXWCXpE,3586640,3592880,well first of all if you don't put in  the effort you will fail  because life is hard and it takes
l2EvNXWCXpE,3592880,3597359,everything out of you to do it properly
l2EvNXWCXpE,3597920,3606798,because if you let your breath go it'll  come back  so  nirvana is not annihilation
l2EvNXWCXpE,3608079,3613760,nirvana is the state of being let go  it is a state of consciousness and a
l2EvNXWCXpE,3613760,3619050,state of being  here and now  in this life
l2EvNXWCXpE,3619050,3626079,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,3626079,3630880,beauty is so valuable and we're so  afraid of it
l2EvNXWCXpE,3631119,3637280,but beauty especially for people who  have an affinity for beauty it's like  music it's one of those things that you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3637280,3643040,can't argue against right you can't even  understand it just hits you  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,3643040,3648960,it's like a vision of the potential  future and something like that as well  that if we just got our act together and
l2EvNXWCXpE,3648960,3656119,beautified things that that's the place  that we can inhabit and that would  ennoble us
l2EvNXWCXpE,3658079,3664480,many of you  going into moments where you are no more  within your sense perception something
l2EvNXWCXpE,3664480,3673599,else is beginning to happen  anything new happens  your mind is such it knows only fear
l2EvNXWCXpE,3674079,3679440,but if you allow it to happen  you will see  you will start experiencing the
l2EvNXWCXpE,3679440,3685280,dimension which is beyond sense  perception  only when your experience of life moves
l2EvNXWCXpE,3685280,3691520,beyond sense perception  then  your experience of life is absolute not
l2EvNXWCXpE,3691520,3695119,in comparison with something else
l2EvNXWCXpE,3696960,3703520,if you truly got passionate about a  future we've all done this you get a  wild idea in your mind and you start
l2EvNXWCXpE,3703520,3708960,holding on to that vision and you're  preoccupied with it all of a sudden the  thought in your mind becomes the
l2EvNXWCXpE,3708960,3715119,experience and you start feeling  the energy of the future now the  stronger the emotion you feel from that
l2EvNXWCXpE,3715119,3720400,vision the more you're going to pay  attention to the picture in your mind  and now you're remembering your future
l2EvNXWCXpE,3720400,3726240,i'm really interested in the invisible  world because the invisible world is  what makes what you see today possible
l2EvNXWCXpE,3726240,3731920,without that we wouldn't see success we  wouldn't see the love we won't see the  relationships but our challenges is that
l2EvNXWCXpE,3731920,3739520,we so much focus on what we see  externally  that we believe the journey of success  should be the same
l2EvNXWCXpE,3739520,3746319,beauty is the proper dwelling place for  an enlightened consciousness and we we  ignore it at our our spiritual and
l2EvNXWCXpE,3746319,3752400,economic peril it's like it's obvious  there's almost nothing more valuable  than beauty
l2EvNXWCXpE,3752400,3758559,we are always thinking that the  satisfaction of life will be coming  later  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,3758559,3765359,there's a good time coming  ever so far away  that one far-off divine event to which
l2EvNXWCXpE,3765359,3771119,all creation moves  don't kid yourself
l2EvNXWCXpE,3771119,3776720,which is to say  [Music]  only suckers
l2EvNXWCXpE,3776720,3783039,put hope in the future  it's this  business of
l2EvNXWCXpE,3783039,3789599,because you're not fully alive now  you think maybe someday you will
l2EvNXWCXpE,3789760,3796430,confucius very wisely said  a man who understands the dao in
l2EvNXWCXpE,3796430,3802720,[Music]  you have to change your vision of who
l2EvNXWCXpE,3802720,3809760,you are  you have to begin telling yourself a  different narrative and the narrative  you tell yourself about yourself is
l2EvNXWCXpE,3809760,3812400,everything
l2EvNXWCXpE,3814799,3822798,if you're not feeling great about  yourself or where your life is right now  the pathway out of that is giving
l2EvNXWCXpE,3823280,3828720,and so during the adversities of where  we are and what we are facing
l2EvNXWCXpE,3828720,3834319,you want to have some things that you're  doing  that will give you the tools the mindset
l2EvNXWCXpE,3834319,3841839,the mental resolve  to handle whatever life throws them at  you why lest because whatever life
l2EvNXWCXpE,3841839,3852079,throws at you you have in you greater is  he that's in you than he that's in the  world you have in you to handle it
l2EvNXWCXpE,3852079,3858160,you you have built in greatness you have  built in power authority and dominion to
l2EvNXWCXpE,3858160,3864038,handle  whatever life throws at you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3882480,3890530,see in this this is the covenant idea  this belief because here's the belief  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,3891200,3896720,it's the willingness to act as if the  world is constructed so that if you do
l2EvNXWCXpE,3896720,3901920,the right thing the best possible  outcome will  occur
l2EvNXWCXpE,3901920,3907680,it's a decision that's the covenant  right it's a decision about how to live  in the world because the evidence can't
l2EvNXWCXpE,3907680,3911280,be there before you make the decision
l2EvNXWCXpE,3914000,3919920,the simple part  that most people don't understand is  that every thought we think in every
l2EvNXWCXpE,3919920,3925119,word we speak  is creating our future
l2EvNXWCXpE,3925119,3930640,it's as though our thoughts go out into  the universe and are accepted and
l2EvNXWCXpE,3930640,3936880,brought back to us as experience  but if you can really accept the fact
l2EvNXWCXpE,3936880,3944240,that every time you think a thought and  every time you speak a word you are  literally painting your future making
l2EvNXWCXpE,3944240,3950119,your dinner whatever you want to call it  you are creating
l2EvNXWCXpE,3953680,3960559,because when you understand  you don't put your hope in time
l2EvNXWCXpE,3960559,3964680,time won't solve a thing
l2EvNXWCXpE,3968079,3973280,to end life is going to be throwing a  lot of stuff nobody's going to be spared
l2EvNXWCXpE,3973280,3981119,that's why victor franco called it  unavoidable  suffering but suffering is a choice
l2EvNXWCXpE,3981119,3987200,you have a choice  because you can suffer  or you can choose
l2EvNXWCXpE,3987200,3994720,to do whatever you need to do to  liberate yourself whatever you need to  do to reinvent yourself whatever you
l2EvNXWCXpE,3994720,4000319,need to do  to get the help that you need  to overcome whatever
l2EvNXWCXpE,4000319,4005160,you are stuck in right now
l2EvNXWCXpE,4006319,4012799,remember i'd like to think the universe  is listening to everything you say and  everything you think and say okay you
l2EvNXWCXpE,4012799,4018880,can get that  so then it starts to bring you in and
l2EvNXWCXpE,4018880,4024640,bring things into you and i know this  sounds far fetched but it's amazing how  it works
l2EvNXWCXpE,4024640,4029760,if you do a good general positive  statement for yourself
l2EvNXWCXpE,4029760,4036880,the universe will figure out how to  manifest that  how to bring that about in your life
l2EvNXWCXpE,4036880,4043440,so things could happen that you wouldn't  expect at all  but they will happen
l2EvNXWCXpE,4045440,4050799,and then the question is well how much  meaning is there in moving forward  towards an ultimate ideal well more
l2EvNXWCXpE,4050799,4058840,meaning even though it's more difficult  how much  well  that's the open question
l2EvNXWCXpE,4058840,4065659,[Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,4072240,4078480,let's suppose that you were able every  night to dream any dream you wanted to  dream
l2EvNXWCXpE,4078960,4085440,and that you could for example have the  power  within one night to dream 75 years of
l2EvNXWCXpE,4085440,4091440,time  or any length of time you wanted to have
l2EvNXWCXpE,4091440,4098960,and you would naturally as you began on  this adventure of dreams you would  fulfill all your wishes
l2EvNXWCXpE,4103199,4109040,but now let's um let's have a surprise  let's have a dream which isn't under
l2EvNXWCXpE,4109040,4117239,control  [Music]  well something is going to happen to me  that i don't know what it's going to be
l2EvNXWCXpE,4118238,4123920,then you would get more and more  adventurous and you would make further  and further out gambles as to what you
l2EvNXWCXpE,4123920,4131880,would dream  and finally you would dream  where you are now
l2EvNXWCXpE,4132390,4140080,[Music]  when you realize that  every single day could be your last or
l2EvNXWCXpE,4140080,4146719,when you appreciate that no matter how  long you live life is a short ride  you just sort of let go of the fears and
l2EvNXWCXpE,4146719,4154080,you let go the limits and you live  full-on and you seize opportunities and  you have real conversations with real
l2EvNXWCXpE,4154080,4160318,people and you sort of wear your heart  on your sleeve and you bring on the  fullness of your authenticity
l2EvNXWCXpE,4160318,4166158,and you do whatever it takes to get your  loftiest dreams to get done
l2EvNXWCXpE,4166880,4172480,the point is that there's some games you  don't get to play unless you're all in  and the other thing that's so
l2EvNXWCXpE,4172480,4179920,interesting about being alive is that  you're all in  no matter what you do you're all in this
l2EvNXWCXpE,4179920,4186960,is going to kill you  so i think you might as well play the  most magnificent game you can
l2EvNXWCXpE,4186960,4192400,while you're waiting because  do you have anything better to do  really
l2EvNXWCXpE,4192400,4198480,why not pick the best thing possible  that you could do  why not do that maybe you could justify
l2EvNXWCXpE,4198480,4204000,your wretched existence to yourself that  way i think you could that's what it  looks like
l2EvNXWCXpE,4204000,4209920,you know people find such meaning in the  responsibilities they adopt it stops  making them ask questions about what
l2EvNXWCXpE,4209920,4213699,life is for  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,4215199,4221199,follow your passion first  first first first first first um and you  got to sit there and ask yourself okay
l2EvNXWCXpE,4221199,4227040,what am i truly passionate about what do  i enjoy doing  and when you feel that way i honestly i
l2EvNXWCXpE,4227040,4233199,mean you feel like you've never worked a  day in your life it's the most fun thing  in the world you get up in the morning  excited about what you're doing and you
l2EvNXWCXpE,4233199,4238640,got to be really honest with yourself  about it  if you wake up in the morning and you're  dreading going to work dude do something
l2EvNXWCXpE,4238640,4245199,else  do something else and those are hard  decisions to make but when you make  those decisions it's a very liberating
l2EvNXWCXpE,4245199,4250158,experience and you'll find out that the  rewards will come
l2EvNXWCXpE,4251360,4257120,change is inevitable  so here's what's going to happen no  matter what's going on in your life is
l2EvNXWCXpE,4257120,4263760,not permanent  everything is going to change  so there's two things you can do with
l2EvNXWCXpE,4263760,4269120,change  you can react to it or you can  participate in it it's going to change
l2EvNXWCXpE,4269120,4274560,anyway  so if you keep waiting around you're  gonna have to react to the change and
l2EvNXWCXpE,4274560,4279319,now you you're behind  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,4280000,4286159,your best laid plans  [Music]  has changed  so what you got to start doing is you
l2EvNXWCXpE,4286159,4291199,got to start anticipating that it's  going to change  and just start living your life into
l2EvNXWCXpE,4291199,4298159,preparation for change  no matter what you're doing you could be  doing more remember that
l2EvNXWCXpE,4298159,4303199,it's 24 hours in a day  you got to use as many of those hours to
l2EvNXWCXpE,4303199,4308760,prepare stability for yourself as you  can
l2EvNXWCXpE,4313330,4319920,[Music]  and internally  if not this moment when
l2EvNXWCXpE,4319920,4326000,right that if we're not going to speak  up now are things going to be easier or  better a year from now we wait for
l2EvNXWCXpE,4326000,4332560,things to calm down we wait for it to be  the right moment  but this is the right moment that we we
l2EvNXWCXpE,4332560,4338480,look back a year in our life five years  ago  and we rarely say
l2EvNXWCXpE,4338480,4346480,i'm disappointed that i spoke up i'm  disappointed that i did my art i'm  disappointed that i connected to  somebody we don't what we regret is not
l2EvNXWCXpE,4346480,4353440,doing that  that responsibility is never given it's  taken  and if you choose to take responsibility
l2EvNXWCXpE,4353440,4359280,all these doors open  up because there is no right answer what  there are
l2EvNXWCXpE,4359280,4378400,are  challenges we can sign up for and  emotions we can experience  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,4378400,4384480,and so what i'm suggesting to you is  do whatever it takes to be in the moment
l2EvNXWCXpE,4384480,4390000,and to stay positive and to stay on your  game and to optimize your craft and to
l2EvNXWCXpE,4390000,4396159,spend time with your loved ones and take  care of your fitness and to learn  something new every day and to enjoy the
l2EvNXWCXpE,4396159,4402960,beauty of sunsets and star-filled nights  and at the same time as much as possible
l2EvNXWCXpE,4402960,4409920,please do not lose perspective stay  connected to your mortality
l2EvNXWCXpE,4409920,4414719,you are naked you have nothing to lose
l2EvNXWCXpE,4417360,4423679,dreams is uh they should be pure i think  a lot of times when we're born into this  world we actually wind up going
l2EvNXWCXpE,4423679,4431760,backwards  and it seems like the more we mature  the more responsible our dreams become
l2EvNXWCXpE,4431760,4437120,the more governors we put on ourselves  and our ability to dream  and to reimagine
l2EvNXWCXpE,4437120,4442320,and it's always a fight for you guys to  make sure that your dreams always stay  pure
l2EvNXWCXpE,4442320,4447520,and so it's not a matter of of  pushing beyond the limitations or
l2EvNXWCXpE,4447520,4453360,expectations it's really a matter of  protecting your dreams protecting your  imagination
l2EvNXWCXpE,4453360,4459120,that's really the key when you do that  then the world just seems  limitless
l2EvNXWCXpE,4459120,4464640,[Music]  because you can't do this without
l2EvNXWCXpE,4464640,4470960,commitment you have to commit to it  first that's the act of faith that you  have to say i'm going to act as if being
l2EvNXWCXpE,4470960,4477040,is good i'm going to act as if truth is  the pathway to enlightenment i'm going  to act as if i should pursue the deepest
l2EvNXWCXpE,4477040,4482400,meaning possible in my life  and there's there's reasons to do none  of those
l2EvNXWCXpE,4482400,4487520,they're real reasons  so it's really a decision  but you you can't find out what the
l2EvNXWCXpE,4487520,4494560,consequence of the decision is unless  you make the decision  that's the nature of life but god in the
l2EvNXWCXpE,4494560,4499920,sense of being the self the deep down  basic whatever there is
l2EvNXWCXpE,4499920,4508239,and you're all that  only you're pretending  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,4512400,4517440,uh courage is the most important  important of all the virtues
l2EvNXWCXpE,4517440,4522800,because without courage you can't  practice any other virtue consistently
l2EvNXWCXpE,4522800,4529679,you see you can't be consistently kind  of fair  or humane
l2EvNXWCXpE,4529679,4535199,or generous  not without courage because if you don't
l2EvNXWCXpE,4535199,4541199,have it sooner or later you'll stop and  say  the threat is too much the the
l2EvNXWCXpE,4541199,4547090,difficulties to to hide  the challenges is too great
l2EvNXWCXpE,4547090,4553440,[Music]  every aspect of our life is the way it
l2EvNXWCXpE,4553440,4559440,is  and then the degree to which we have a  narrative or commentary about it being
l2EvNXWCXpE,4559440,4566400,the way it is but we want it to be  different  that difference is the degree to which  we suffer
l2EvNXWCXpE,4566400,4572800,when i'm truly in harmony with what is  then there is no resistance  and based on the fact that we've got
l2EvNXWCXpE,4572800,4578560,this linear time game i can still be  committed to where i'm going or what i'd  like to create but it is the way it is
l2EvNXWCXpE,4578560,4584480,right now  and my hope is to trigger you to think  about how could you turn your labor into
l2EvNXWCXpE,4584480,4590080,your love  and when your vocation becomes your  vacation that's when life becomes truly
l2EvNXWCXpE,4590080,4595120,magnificent  and i know you know this in your soul is
l2EvNXWCXpE,4595120,4600239,that we all know if you're going to be  masterful at something you don't show up  you know as the best in the world at
l2EvNXWCXpE,4600239,4606080,something you don't show up in  environments that you want to be in you  get there because you did things for
l2EvNXWCXpE,4606080,4612800,thousands and thousands of hours when  you do something enough with enough  intensity enough intention to constantly  get better when your labor is your love
l2EvNXWCXpE,4612800,4619520,and where your labor is something you  have to always get better at  then usually what happens is you get  these insights that allow you to serve
l2EvNXWCXpE,4619520,4626159,more  if you are haunted by reveries of the
l2EvNXWCXpE,4626159,4631760,past  they continue to come up in your mind
l2EvNXWCXpE,4631760,4637199,over and over in your dreams over and  over  you haven't extracted
l2EvNXWCXpE,4637199,4642239,the world out from your past experiences  the potential is still trapped in the
l2EvNXWCXpE,4642239,4649199,past and to confront the potential means  to confront the dragon of the past and  of course that's terrifying it can
l2EvNXWCXpE,4649199,4655040,seriously be terrifying  you're already okay
l2EvNXWCXpE,4655040,4660080,it's like no you're not and the reason  you're not is because you could be way  more than you are so what do you want to
l2EvNXWCXpE,4660080,4666560,be you want to be okay as you are or do  you want to strive towards what's better
l2EvNXWCXpE,4667280,4673040,the question is whether future takes  over your mind  being able to use it for practical
l2EvNXWCXpE,4673040,4679199,purposes is of course great  clock time is fine but psychological
l2EvNXWCXpE,4679199,4685920,time is when the future takes over your  mind and your entire thought patterns  are geared only towards future and you
l2EvNXWCXpE,4685920,4691440,treat the present moment  as  either just a means to an end because
l2EvNXWCXpE,4691440,4697679,enables you to get to the next one  you're always reaching out so to speak  internally to the next yet never quite
l2EvNXWCXpE,4697679,4706440,here always looking for some fulfillment  there so you can never embrace the  fullness of now
l2EvNXWCXpE,4707840,4713600,love  is a condition  so powerful
l2EvNXWCXpE,4713600,4721480,it may be  that which  holds the stars in the firmament
l2EvNXWCXpE,4722960,4728239,you have to have courage to love  somebody because you miss everything
l2EvNXWCXpE,4728239,4731239,everything
l2EvNXWCXpE,4742330,4747840,[Music]  but to accept your pathway without
l2EvNXWCXpE,4747840,4753040,resistance is where you're going to find  freedom but what happened is one of my  quotes would say what happened happened
l2EvNXWCXpE,4753040,4759280,and couldn't have happened any other way  because it didn't  and if you really get that there's a lot  of freedom to be found because
l2EvNXWCXpE,4759280,4765280,oftentimes we're judging our history as  though that shouldn't have happened they  shouldn't have done that well now you'll  stop
l2EvNXWCXpE,4765280,4769840,what happened happened couldn't have  happened out of the way because it  didn't
l2EvNXWCXpE,4772000,4777440,when you hit pay dirt like that when you  connect and you connect to the field  when you connect the divine whatever you
l2EvNXWCXpE,4777440,4782880,want to call it when your consciousness  merges with a greater consciousness and  that arousal creates ecstasy bliss
l2EvNXWCXpE,4782880,4791159,oneness whatever you want to call that  you realize that it never came from  anything out there
l2EvNXWCXpE,4793920,4799280,it came from within you and so you stop  looking out there for it now the love
l2EvNXWCXpE,4799280,4805760,affair begins and you never want to miss  a date because it's just too good
l2EvNXWCXpE,4805760,4810800,more fundamental than the outer purpose  is what most people usually overlook
l2EvNXWCXpE,4810800,4816000,and that is the realization that  what matters most is finding
l2EvNXWCXpE,4816000,4822719,your inner purpose so  inner purpose is aligning your life
l2EvNXWCXpE,4822719,4829199,fully  with  the present moment  so that you are no longer out of
l2EvNXWCXpE,4829199,4836000,alignment with the present moment which  leads to the state of dissatisfaction  that we talked about that is the reality
l2EvNXWCXpE,4836000,4842639,for many people  so you have to go first of all beyond  the state of dissatisfaction that is so
l2EvNXWCXpE,4842639,4848080,many people's reality right but you  cannot go beyond the state of  dissatisfaction
l2EvNXWCXpE,4848080,4855280,through some future goal that says one  day i would like to be in a state of  fulfillment or satisfaction no you have
l2EvNXWCXpE,4855280,4861760,to  enter the state of fulfillment and  satisfaction by becoming one internally
l2EvNXWCXpE,4861760,4866439,with the present moment  [Music]
l2EvNXWCXpE,4867440,4875199,you can't make yourself interested in  something  [Music]  interest  manifests itself and grips you
l2EvNXWCXpE,4875199,4881440,that's a whole different thing  and so what is it that's gripping you  how do you conceptualize that is that a
l2EvNXWCXpE,4881440,4888080,divine power well it's divine as far as  you're concerned because it grips you  and you can't do anything about it and
l2EvNXWCXpE,4888080,4894320,so there's a calling in you towards what  you're compelled by and what you're  interested in and sometimes that might  be very dark
l2EvNXWCXpE,4894320,4902120,and sometimes not but you're compelled  forward by your interest  and so
l2EvNXWCXpE,4902239,4907760,what moves you away from your country  and your father's house and the comforts  of your child at home is is something
l2EvNXWCXpE,4907760,4914000,that's beyond you and that you listen to  and hearken to  that's exactly right
l2EvNXWCXpE,4915600,4920080,but it takes this complexity
l2EvNXWCXpE,4921360,4928639,of power  to evoke  the world
l2EvNXWCXpE,4928960,4935280,if you do not listen to that thing that  beckons you forward you will pay for it  like you cannot possibly imagine
l2EvNXWCXpE,4935280,4942880,you'll have everything that's terrible  about life  in your life and nothing about it that's  good and worse you'll know that it was
l2EvNXWCXpE,4942880,4950319,your fault and that you squandered what  you could have had  [Music]
