_qkB6LTbzQ8,50,6879,[Music]  every morning when you wake up  you are living moments you will never
_qkB6LTbzQ8,6879,12639,get back  you're breathing air you'll never  breathe again
_qkB6LTbzQ8,12639,19600,time is our most precious commodity  and what we do with it is everything it
_qkB6LTbzQ8,19600,24960,is your one opportunity to embrace the  best gift you will ever receive and
_qkB6LTbzQ8,24960,31439,every second  sees a little more  slip away
_qkB6LTbzQ8,31439,36719,we have this mentality that the future  is going to somehow mean more than the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,36719,43360,present  that time tomorrow  will mean more than time today and the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,43360,50719,best things in life end up being saved  for some other  time but the reality is we don't get any
_qkB6LTbzQ8,50719,56800,younger  why wouldn't you allocate your time your  effort to the things that make you feel
_qkB6LTbzQ8,56800,62160,like today is powerful  you are the gatekeeper
_qkB6LTbzQ8,62160,68880,you decide whether you want to take this  gift and use it wisely or allow it to
_qkB6LTbzQ8,68880,74960,slip away  money you can get back possessions can
_qkB6LTbzQ8,74960,82640,be reacquired  but the minutes in your life well  they're finite
_qkB6LTbzQ8,83439,90799,today shouldn't be looked at as a bridge  to tomorrow but a once-in-a-lifetime  opportunity
_qkB6LTbzQ8,90799,100280,you were nothing more  and nothing less  than what you do with the time you have
_qkB6LTbzQ8,100320,106640,and if you know that  if you live like you are on top of the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,106640,112250,world  it will be more than enough
_qkB6LTbzQ8,112250,122069,[Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,125040,130879,a fire doesn't just appear  it isn't born out of thin air or
_qkB6LTbzQ8,130879,136879,imagined into reality  it begins with a spark
_qkB6LTbzQ8,136879,142560,a belief  the notion that something can be
_qkB6LTbzQ8,142560,148879,accomplished  long before it begins to materialize
_qkB6LTbzQ8,149040,155040,belief is looking at the pieces around  you and understanding that in one way or  another
_qkB6LTbzQ8,155040,161280,they'll all come together to create the  outcome that you want
_qkB6LTbzQ8,161280,167920,it's the backbone of any pursuit  because you're taking the unknown and  you are knocking it down
_qkB6LTbzQ8,167920,174720,a peg  standing up to the fears the doubts the  demons in your head
_qkB6LTbzQ8,174720,180319,when we fail it's because we believe  that our obstacles are bigger than us we
_qkB6LTbzQ8,180319,185599,succumb to that  reality but when one understands that
_qkB6LTbzQ8,185599,194959,belief the very same thought process  that can be our greatest detriment  is also our greatest asset
_qkB6LTbzQ8,194959,201360,we become  limitless if you know you're going to  cross the finish line
_qkB6LTbzQ8,201360,208239,if you're certain if you can already see  it  everything else becomes trivial
_qkB6LTbzQ8,208239,213760,nothing is debilitating nothing is game  ending because you'll get around it you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,213760,221840,know who you are you know where you  should be  that is the most challenging part
_qkB6LTbzQ8,221840,227760,once you're certain of that  it's simply a matter of putting one foot
_qkB6LTbzQ8,227760,233879,in front of the other  [Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,236640,244799,we live in a world  of self-induced limitation  we define our best
_qkB6LTbzQ8,244799,251200,we define good versus great possible  versus impossible acceptable versus
_qkB6LTbzQ8,251200,256579,insufficient and these limitations guide  our behavior we live by them
_qkB6LTbzQ8,256579,261759,[Music]  our understanding of limits paves the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,261759,269120,way for our reality  once we define something as our best it
_qkB6LTbzQ8,269120,276240,becomes our summit  once we label it as crazy or far-fetched
_qkB6LTbzQ8,276240,284320,we turn our backs on it  but here's a beautiful truth there are  no limits in everyday life unless you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,284320,289759,place them there  you don't have a true personal best
_qkB6LTbzQ8,289759,296400,because you can always be better  there is one way or another or out to
_qkB6LTbzQ8,296400,304000,achieve anything you deem worthy of  achieving  the key is not seeking to define
_qkB6LTbzQ8,304000,309840,excellence but to be continuously  seeking progress
_qkB6LTbzQ8,309840,315919,that mentality you'll see that there is  always a next level and it's always
_qkB6LTbzQ8,315919,319639,within reach
_qkB6LTbzQ8,329360,337360,it's been said that nothing is achieved  without consistency  short blasts of intensity are great
_qkB6LTbzQ8,337360,342800,but what end up defining us in the long  run are the things that we do day in and  day out
_qkB6LTbzQ8,342800,348400,these things become our habits routines  and ultimately shape the people we
_qkB6LTbzQ8,348400,354080,become  a lot of attention is given to the home
_qkB6LTbzQ8,354080,360080,run  obtaining that monumental  result without understanding that the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,360080,365360,big things are simply comprised of  smaller components
_qkB6LTbzQ8,365360,374160,little pieces of paper that stack up  every day bricks that are laid down one  by one you can't see greatness happen
_qkB6LTbzQ8,374160,379360,because it's not instantaneous it's not  done in a weekend
_qkB6LTbzQ8,379360,385120,but it is present  and it's present every single day
_qkB6LTbzQ8,385120,390240,a building we walk by is comprised of  thousands of individual parts
_qkB6LTbzQ8,390240,397199,an all-star that knocks down a  three-pointer has taken that shot  hundreds of thousands of times a ceo has
_qkB6LTbzQ8,397199,405199,studied his or her particular field to  an extent most people couldn't even  comprehend people don't see consistency
_qkB6LTbzQ8,405199,410479,they see the outcome of that consistency  and while there's nothing technically
_qkB6LTbzQ8,410479,416000,wrong with that it's only part of the  equation and that's my message today
_qkB6LTbzQ8,416000,422000,these accomplishments just like any  others they take effort distributed and
_qkB6LTbzQ8,422000,428400,routinely implemented every  single day and this consistency is what
_qkB6LTbzQ8,428400,434319,gets you the larger than life result  it's what constructs your victory
_qkB6LTbzQ8,434319,440319,not once in a while or when it's  convenient  but making incremental manageable
_qkB6LTbzQ8,440319,446080,progress every day and these days become  the foundation that you stand on
_qkB6LTbzQ8,446080,452560,one is not worth more than another  to get the big result every single small
_qkB6LTbzQ8,452560,458240,step is imperative  every move forward  is
_qkB6LTbzQ8,458240,467600,your home run  [Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,472879,480000,in a limitless world  why set your sights on the obtainable
_qkB6LTbzQ8,480000,487280,the prize within an arm's reach  why not think  bigger
_qkB6LTbzQ8,488479,495759,our expectations are the foundation for  our accomplishments  the target you aim for
_qkB6LTbzQ8,495759,503039,is more than likely going to be the  target you hit  which means it's quite possible
_qkB6LTbzQ8,503039,508639,to do exactly what you set out to do and  still drastically under achieve
_qkB6LTbzQ8,508639,515039,for the sole reason that you are worth  more  you are capable of more than you give
_qkB6LTbzQ8,515039,520479,yourself credit for but like anything  if you don't recognize and do something
_qkB6LTbzQ8,520479,526800,about it the impact will be minimal  it doesn't matter that you're the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,526800,532240,fastest person in the world if you never  sprint
_qkB6LTbzQ8,532240,537760,it's impossible to stumble into  excellence  because to get there you need to one
_qkB6LTbzQ8,537760,544160,understand that something greater exists  and to understand that you are worthy of  it
_qkB6LTbzQ8,544160,550399,in anything you do it's better to aim  high  to try and accomplish too much
_qkB6LTbzQ8,550399,557040,be bigger than reality larger than life  and what you'll find in maintaining  these monumental expectations is that
_qkB6LTbzQ8,557040,562720,you grow along with them  you realize that what was acceptable
_qkB6LTbzQ8,562720,569200,yesterday is no longer good enough  that it was merely a stepping stone
_qkB6LTbzQ8,569200,576240,the things you're capable of the life  that's possible for you is unfathomable  to the human mind endless opportunities
_qkB6LTbzQ8,576240,581839,are not black and white  they're not reassuring because they  haven't happened yet they're not visible
_qkB6LTbzQ8,581839,587200,or tangible but that's okay  just know that no matter where you are
_qkB6LTbzQ8,587200,593440,or what you want  more exists  if you're willing to go to another level
_qkB6LTbzQ8,593440,599680,there is something bigger period  so take a look at the targets that
_qkB6LTbzQ8,599680,607519,you've set  don't waste time asking yourself whether  there's something greater there is
_qkB6LTbzQ8,607519,613040,ask yourself if you're willing to step  up to move outside your comfort zone
_qkB6LTbzQ8,613040,630729,and get it  [Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,632959,638640,how many revolutionary ideas were never  brought into existence
_qkB6LTbzQ8,638640,646000,how many dreams were discarded and  deemed impossible before they even had a  chance
_qkB6LTbzQ8,646000,652800,it's a question we'll never know the  answer to because  there never was a beginning
_qkB6LTbzQ8,652800,658959,there never was a start  anyone can dream
_qkB6LTbzQ8,658959,666560,and everyone does  and these dreams they're the seeds that  quite literally change the world but the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,666560,672399,hardest part  is the decision to begin
_qkB6LTbzQ8,672399,678160,to transform something from an idea in  your head into a reality that you can
_qkB6LTbzQ8,678160,683839,live every day  to push fear uncertainty aside maybe you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,683839,689120,don't even know how to approach your  goal but i'll tell you what
_qkB6LTbzQ8,689120,694240,trying a million times and figuring it  out on attempt one million and one
_qkB6LTbzQ8,694240,700320,will always be better than letting that  dream die see action movement has a way
_qkB6LTbzQ8,700320,707839,of sorting things out  there's always a way to succeed but the  wheels need to hit the pavement
_qkB6LTbzQ8,707839,713519,it's awkward  it's uncomfortable it's a vulnerable  feeling putting your time and energy
_qkB6LTbzQ8,713519,719279,into something you're unsure  but simply starting
_qkB6LTbzQ8,719279,725440,allows a spectacular process to take  shape  beginning is only the hardest part
_qkB6LTbzQ8,725440,732399,because of the mental barriers that  attempt to safeguard you from every  single thing that can go wrong
_qkB6LTbzQ8,732399,739279,but don't think about what can go wrong  focus on what will go  right all the incredible change that
_qkB6LTbzQ8,739279,744370,will come your way if you just  start
_qkB6LTbzQ8,744370,756249,[Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,760120,768079,[Music]  i don't think it's any secret that life  doesn't always go the way we drew it up
_qkB6LTbzQ8,768079,774480,it's great to have a game plan but it's  just as important  to be practical with regard to life's
_qkB6LTbzQ8,774480,781920,ups and downs  success lies not in the ability to get  everything right the first time
_qkB6LTbzQ8,781920,787040,but to adjust  [Music]  we can't afford to be one-dimensional
_qkB6LTbzQ8,787040,794800,with our pursuits because the second  things go wrong we panic we go into  emergency mode
_qkB6LTbzQ8,794800,800880,life only begins to make sense when we  learn to expect those twists and turns
_qkB6LTbzQ8,800880,806160,teach ourselves to adapt move forward  despite their occurrence
_qkB6LTbzQ8,806160,814560,this brings to light a very important  truth it is not  the road ahead that determines your fate
_qkB6LTbzQ8,814560,822000,it's the way you internalize the process  it's having the patience and the  confidence to take life as it comes and
_qkB6LTbzQ8,822000,828240,mold it in a way that gets you to your  goals  as long as your wheels don't stop
_qkB6LTbzQ8,828240,835920,turning you are never stuck as long as  you are willing to adjust there will  never be an end in sight until you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,835920,842279,put the stake in the ground and declare  victory
_qkB6LTbzQ8,851760,856800,control is responsibility  it's being in the driver's seat and
_qkB6LTbzQ8,856800,862639,knowing that the result you get is  directly correlated with you and your  decisions
_qkB6LTbzQ8,862639,867680,see it's easy to point the blame it's  easy to be helpless and play the victim
_qkB6LTbzQ8,867680,874399,but the empowered embrace of fundamental  truth  that when you take control of your life
_qkB6LTbzQ8,874399,879199,you own  its outcome
_qkB6LTbzQ8,880240,886079,now this isn't always easy because it  means confronting the difficult things  in your life
_qkB6LTbzQ8,886079,892560,taking the necessary road not  necessarily the easy one
_qkB6LTbzQ8,892560,899440,but when you decide that you are the  author that you hold the pen  you dictate your story
_qkB6LTbzQ8,899440,904720,there's no reason to exhaust time and  energy on how unfair life can be life
_qkB6LTbzQ8,904720,910320,isn't fair we all know that but it's not  supposed to be
_qkB6LTbzQ8,910320,915839,winners win because they find ways to  take their situation and transform it
_qkB6LTbzQ8,915839,920880,into a result that they want  not look at the world around them as an
_qkB6LTbzQ8,920880,927519,external force pushing them down  but as everything they could ever need  to build upon
_qkB6LTbzQ8,927519,932880,you have  control  whatever comes your way is working for
_qkB6LTbzQ8,932880,940079,you it's allowing you to grow providing  the pieces for you to create your own
_qkB6LTbzQ8,940079,945360,narrative  the key is not to deflect out
_qkB6LTbzQ8,945360,950800,but to reflect in  to take control of your life and get
_qkB6LTbzQ8,950800,960128,what you want  [Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,960560,963560,so
_qkB6LTbzQ8,967940,974639,[Music]  luck is what happens when preparation  meets hard work
_qkB6LTbzQ8,974639,981680,seneca  how many times have you heard luck used
_qkB6LTbzQ8,981680,986720,as the explanation for events that have  unfolded  successful people or fortunate
_qkB6LTbzQ8,986720,993040,occurrences they're deemed lucky  negative unfortunate situations well
_qkB6LTbzQ8,993040,998720,they're unlucky  but what if luck had very little to do
_qkB6LTbzQ8,998720,1004639,with anything  what if the events in your life were the  result of both the way you look at the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1004639,1011199,world and the way you prepare yourself  for what comes your way
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1011199,1016560,to lean on the concept of luck  is to relinquish control over your life
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1016560,1022399,to reallocate  power it does nothing for you except  deceive
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1022399,1029839,and manipulate  the truth is great situations are going  to arise as well as challenging times
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1029839,1036558,what will matter in either is how you  handle them  when opportunities come your way do you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1036558,1043120,capitalize are you ready can you make  the most of what's been presented to you  and on the other hand when the negative
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1043120,1050000,arises can you see it for what it is a  temporary obstacle that you can and will
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1050000,1057440,get  past there's nothing unlucky about  what's happening around you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1057440,1064400,because what's happening around you is  life it's your job to deal with it to  play your hand and live out every day
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1064400,1072000,like it's a gift  the ones who are prepared positive  ambitious by their very nature they will
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1072000,1078559,achieve  and when they do they'll be called lucky  by passers-by
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1078559,1087200,but don't allow yourself  to fall for this luck is not given it is  never given luck is made
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1087200,1093400,every  single  day
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1094440,1108108,[Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1108160,1113200,there's a delicate balance that occurs  when moving toward a goal
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1113200,1120160,and we need to be thinking about the  possibilities  the future what can be
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1120160,1126480,goals are impactful because you're  creating something meaningful in a place  where it doesn't yet exist
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1126480,1132000,[Music]  but that's also what makes the journey  so difficult
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1132000,1138880,because it means there's going to be a  substantial stretch of time where you  wake up and haven't yet accomplished
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1138880,1145600,your primary objective  that's a lot of mornings  working toward a dream holding on to
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1145600,1154000,hope and trust believing you'll get to  the top knowing that you will conquer  whatever is in the future
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1154640,1160400,and while tomorrow may contain the  treasure we so desperately seek let us
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1160400,1166960,not forget about the many steps  that occurred before today
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1166960,1174080,about the persistence the courage the  self-belief you would not be standing  where you are right now
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1174080,1180080,without the platform that you've built  over time  [Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1180080,1186720,and that's an accomplishment that should  never be overlooked  when eyes are only focused on what
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1186720,1192400,you've yet to acquire and what you  haven't created you're minimizing your  own momentum
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1192400,1197600,[Music]  look mindset is the beginning and the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1197600,1205039,end of every endeavor if you feel like a  winner you will win somehow some way
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1205039,1210720,so just as important as building and  working toward the next milestone is  recognizing
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1210720,1216080,and feeling good about the milestones of  yesterday these small victories
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1216080,1222240,have become ingrained into who you are  they have built you up and will continue
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1222240,1227280,to push you to greater things  they are your proof
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1227280,1233440,your reassurance that you will find a  way that is your identity
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1233440,1238480,accomplishments are a balance  a balance of forward progress where you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1238480,1243760,need to go  and of earned confidence comprised of
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1243760,1250159,the many steps that got you to where you  are now so don't forget every once in a
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1250159,1255880,while  to look back
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1255880,1260740,[Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1263840,1270640,why is moving in the direction that we  need to go  so often met with apprehension
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1270640,1278640,why is our fear of the unknown greater  than our fear of settling for  unhappiness or the status quo
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1278640,1284480,when you look at this through a lens of  rationality it makes very little sense
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1284480,1291520,you know human beings like what is known  what is certain even if it's at the  expense of something better
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1291520,1298799,and that mentality is what breeds  mediocrity it creates a life of simply  getting by
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1298799,1304080,see by refusing to take risks you are  essentially risking it all because you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1304080,1310559,are creating regret  and regret is the monster in the closet
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1310559,1317679,regret is the danger worth fearing that  someday you'll look back and wish that  you'd live life on your own terms that
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1317679,1324159,you've been a little braver a tad more  adventurous  truth be told this world is just not as
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1324159,1330480,scary as we make it out to be  but the trick isn't knowing that the  trick is doing something about it
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1330480,1337760,convincing your brain that everything  will be okay  otherwise we spend our entire lives
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1337760,1343200,standing behind the curtain that  separates us from the stage
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1343200,1350320,why because the lights might be a tad  too bright i don't know about you but  that sure as hell beats a life in the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1350320,1355520,dark  the risks you take are directly  correlated to your happiness your
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1355520,1360799,progress fulfillment success these  things can't exist without some element
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1360799,1366320,of trust that everything will be okay  that the road you don't know
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1366320,1371559,can take you wherever you want it to

_qkB6LTbzQ8,1382240,1387919,in today's world things come quickly  information is instantaneous consumer
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1387919,1394880,goods are shipped to us at the click of  a button we want now  and we get now
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1394880,1400320,and in many ways that's great it's  vastly improved our lives but the danger
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1400320,1407039,is when that immediate satisfaction or  validation is applied to our own goals
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1407039,1412960,when that thinking translates into  impatience with your journey or your  progress
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1412960,1419200,whatever your dream is whatever you're  working toward it can't be bought with  one click on amazon
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1419200,1424320,right the good stuff the important  things they take time
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1424320,1430320,a million little wins  ups downs failures successes all jumbled
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1430320,1437279,into what will eventually be the  mountain you stand on  but how you visualize that mountain is
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1437279,1443600,crucial  people quit not because something is  beyond their capability they quit
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1443600,1450640,because they lose sight of the simple  truth that winning takes time that  getting to your finish line requires
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1450640,1456880,patience  and if it didn't i can tell you right  now it would not have the same value
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1456880,1463440,would not be so highly regarded  the things you want most are earned and
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1463440,1468639,they're earned step by step day by day
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1468799,1483640,have the patience to see that through  [Music]
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1487120,1492960,there's a difference between going  through the motions  and standing out
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1492960,1498840,one requires action the other calls for  meaningful action and the difference is
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1498840,1505279,tremendous the passion that drives you  determines whether you make an impact or
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1505279,1511279,clap as someone else does  passion is an army
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1511279,1519039,it protects you from a world rampant  with negativity it pushes you forward  when you're tired when you're weak
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1519039,1524080,the difference between victory and every  other outcome is a desire that lives
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1524080,1529760,much deeper than what's shown on the  surface it's what creates curiosity it's
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1529760,1535440,what makes you jump out of bed it makes  the hours and hours of focus and work
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1535440,1541039,all  worth it  when you love something boundaries mean
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1541039,1547840,very little  there's always more to see there's more  to discover settling isn't an option
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1547840,1553919,quitting isn't entertained because it  means you'd be walking away from the  good stuff
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1553919,1560400,what's around the corner  which for some may be an option but not
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1560400,1566240,for the passionate not for those who  need it like oxygen if greatness is the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1566240,1572158,goal passion is not a luxury it is a  requirement
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1572320,1577760,it's your ticket past the detours and  roadblocks that send most people in the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1577760,1584000,other direction being great means  standing out and standing out requires a
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1584000,1591120,burning desire to reach the top it's  your spark and your momentum the wind on
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1591120,1598240,your back if you are passionate about  the road ahead  the twists and turns are part of the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1598240,1604880,equation in fact you live for those very  ups and downs because nothing is going
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1604880,1612278,to stop you from the journey and  wherever it may lead
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1622159,1628080,sometimes our greatest gains are the  result of our greatest losses
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1628080,1633360,the losses that at the time shake up our  world they catch us off guard and even
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1633360,1638960,devastate us  it could be incredibly tough
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1638960,1644559,in the midst of misfortune to remind  ourselves that when one door closes  another opens
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1644559,1649120,that when one journey ends another  begins
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1649840,1658480,but change  pushes us  it requires it mandates that we grow
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1658480,1663679,rise to the events occurring around us a  loss will always remind us
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1663679,1671840,of what we once had how things used to  be  but what we sometimes fail to see is the
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1671840,1677600,beauty and significance  of the chapter
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1677679,1683840,and that without it  the book wouldn't be complete
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1684640,1689760,we needed the lessons learned  those people in our lives those moments
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1689760,1696120,of joy sadness they're what positioned  us to move forward
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1697520,1704720,loss is no tragedy  any more than the sun setting at dusk
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1704720,1711039,it encapsulates everything good in our  lives while simultaneously
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1711039,1716840,waving us on  to tomorrow's sunrise

_qkB6LTbzQ8,1728080,1734640,greatness is a decision  failure is a decision
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1734640,1740799,winning losing mediocrity these are  decisions  that we make
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1740799,1746640,none of them can exist in your life  without a green light given by you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1746640,1752080,they require your approval  now this isn't to say outside
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1752080,1758960,circumstances don't play a part  right of course they do  but they're merely pieces it's up to you
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1758960,1766960,to look at what's in front of you  the good and the bad and put it all  together to tell the story that you want
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1766960,1774399,to tell  see failure is a decision because it's a  stopping point
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1774399,1780880,failure doesn't mean that you stumbled  or made a mistake or had to pick your  pride up off the floor no failure means
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1780880,1788159,that you stopped  you decided that for one reason or  another moving forward simply isn't
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1788159,1796799,worth it  that the tough moments outweigh the  great ones and so you decided to settle
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1797360,1802640,but the reality is everyone deals with  hardship the differentiator is that some
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1802640,1807840,people decide to let it consume them and  keep them down while others decide that
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1807840,1814320,the unfortunate events will be nothing  more than speed bumps on their way to  greatness
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1814320,1819360,it doesn't matter what stands before  them because they've already chosen
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1819360,1827200,excellence they've chosen to take the  negative and turn it into the necessary  ingredients to move forward
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1827200,1834080,and that's one of the greatest decisions  that one can make simply to move on to  find a way
_qkB6LTbzQ8,1834080,1840559,because if you're willing to persist  there will be no end points
