WAWXj3GE9Tg,12745,14614,">> YES, THIS IS A LONG ONE BUT"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,14614,16883,WE ARE GETTING THROUGH THIS.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,16883,18418,IT LOOKS LIKE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,18418,18885,JOHN ROBERTS AND
WAWXj3GE9Tg,18885,19586,JUSTICE KAVANAUGH JOINED WITH
WAWXj3GE9Tg,19586,23223,THE LIBERAL THREE JUSTICES FOR A

WAWXj3GE9Tg,24657,25391,BIDEN DECISION FOR NOW FOR THIS
WAWXj3GE9Tg,25391,27927,ONE IS COMPLICATED.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,27927,29995,THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION OF

WAWXj3GE9Tg,45244,46012,SENDING THIS CASE BACK DOWN FOR
WAWXj3GE9Tg,46012,48415,FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.

WAWXj3GE9Tg,66165,67367,EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN TRYING
WAWXj3GE9Tg,67367,68767,TO DO IN THEIR POLICIES.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,68767,69769,DOES LOOK LIKE THE FINAL PHASE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,69769,71504,OF THAT TERM IS GOING TO BE ONE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,71504,73706,THAT WILL MAKE THE WHITE HOUSE

WAWXj3GE9Tg,92058,93359,CONGRESSMAN?

WAWXj3GE9Tg,97163,98464,THE MIGRANTS WITH RESPECT AND

WAWXj3GE9Tg,98798,101968,"AT THE SAME TIME, HAVE"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,101968,102401,REPERCUSSIONS.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,102401,104838,WE FOLLOW THE LAWS BECAUSE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,104838,105471,"OTHERWISE, WE ARE GOING TO"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,105471,107373,CONTINUE TO HAVE A RECORD NUMBER

WAWXj3GE9Tg,109309,110242,UNITED STATES.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,110242,111744,AND A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO
WAWXj3GE9Tg,111744,114480,BE RELEASED ON OUR STREETS.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,114480,116849,I WANT TO REPLACE THE POLICIES
WAWXj3GE9Tg,116849,119419,HAVE TO BE IN A CENTRAL WAY THAT
WAWXj3GE9Tg,119419,120553,IT DOESN'T -- MORE PEOPLE ARE

WAWXj3GE9Tg,129295,131330,IDEA OF REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY
WAWXj3GE9Tg,131330,133600,IS TO TRY TO HAVE A PROCESS
WAWXj3GE9Tg,133600,134667,"HERE, NOT SWAMP THE BORDER"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,134667,135001,PATROL.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,135001,138004,LET'S HAVE THEM REMAIN IN
WAWXj3GE9Tg,138004,138337,MEXICO.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,138337,139906,THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TRIED
WAWXj3GE9Tg,139906,140707,TWICE TO GET RID OF IT.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,140707,142108,DID YOU EVER ADVISE THEM THAT
WAWXj3GE9Tg,142108,144777,WAS A BAD DECISION?
WAWXj3GE9Tg,144777,146846,>> MY POSITION HAS BEEN THAT IN
WAWXj3GE9Tg,146846,149482,"THIS CASE, IF YOU HAVE A REMAIN"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,149482,151784,IN MEXICO AND THEY HAVE ACCESS
WAWXj3GE9Tg,151784,152785,TO AN ATTORNEY THEY WANT TO COME
WAWXj3GE9Tg,152785,156856,"AND PRESENT THEIR CASE, AND THEY"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,156856,158825,"ARE IN A SAFE SITUATION, THEN WE"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,158825,160526,OUGHT TO DO THAT.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,160526,161194,"OTHERWISE, YOU HAVE SO MANY"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,161194,163930,"PEOPLE THAT COME IN, COME INTO"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,163930,165398,THE UNITED STATES.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,165398,166966,AND A LOT OF THEM ARE GIVEN
WAWXj3GE9Tg,166966,167867,FALSE HOPE BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,167867,172939,"A HUNDRED PEOPLE, ONLY 10-12%"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,172939,175007,ARE GIVEN ASYLUM.

WAWXj3GE9Tg,177409,177843,GIVEN ASYLUM.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,177843,180613,WHY ARE WE LETTING 100% AND WE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,180613,182782,SHOULD BE ALLOWING ONLY 10% OR
WAWXj3GE9Tg,182782,183616,12% OF THOSE PEOPLE COME INTO
WAWXj3GE9Tg,183616,187253,THE UNITED STATES?

WAWXj3GE9Tg,189055,190256,BEEN AWAY FOR FIVE DAYS AT NATO
WAWXj3GE9Tg,190256,191591,FOR A MEETING.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,191591,192291,THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THINGS
WAWXj3GE9Tg,192291,193526,HAPPENING BACK HOME.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,193526,195061,THERE IS THE ROE V. WADE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,195061,195528,DECISION.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,195528,196829,IT IS THE FACT THAT INFLATION
WAWXj3GE9Tg,196829,200500,AND GAS PRICES CONTINUE.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,200500,201868,CRIME ACROSS THE BORDER.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,201868,202568,"EXCUSE ME, ACROSS THE COUNTRY"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,202568,205704,AND THE REALLY BIG ISSUE.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,205704,207339,THE BORDER IS A MAJOR ISSUE.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,207339,209108,GRIFF JENKINS HAS BEEN THERE FOR
WAWXj3GE9Tg,209108,209776,SIX DAYS.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,209776,211978,"HE COUNTED 9,000 PEOPLE CAME"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,211978,212645,ACROSS.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,212645,214414,DO YOU THINK BIDEN WILL EVER
WAWXj3GE9Tg,214414,216181,TURN HIS ATTENTION TO THE BORDER
WAWXj3GE9Tg,216181,218918,IN A SERIOUS WAY BEFORE THE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,218918,220453,MIDTERM?
WAWXj3GE9Tg,220453,221086,">> YEAH, YOU KNOW."
WAWXj3GE9Tg,221086,225591,I FEEL BAD FOR THE -- SO MANY
WAWXj3GE9Tg,225591,226191,ISSUES HAPPENING IN THE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,226191,226892,UNITED STATES DOMESTICALLY AND
WAWXj3GE9Tg,226892,229261,"ACROSS THE WORLD, DEALING WITH"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,229261,230663,RUSSIA AND CHINA.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,230663,231463,"I FEEL, YOU KNOW, BAD FOR HIM."
WAWXj3GE9Tg,231463,234100,"AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WERE"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,234100,236569,PEOPLE THAT CAN IMPLEMENT THE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,236569,238438,LAWS THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS
WAWXj3GE9Tg,238438,239172,ALREADY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,239172,240873,IS REPERCUSSIONS.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,240873,243843,"BECAUSE OTHERWISE, AND WE FINISH"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,243843,245111,THIS FISCAL YEAR WHICH WILL BE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,245111,247447,"ON SEPTEMBER 30TH, WE ARE GOING"
WAWXj3GE9Tg,247447,248814,TO HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF
WAWXj3GE9Tg,248814,250716,PEOPLE COMING INTO THE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,250716,251984,UNITED STATES.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,251984,254687,AND THIS IS WHY CERTAIN POLICIES
WAWXj3GE9Tg,254687,256022,LIKE TITLE 42 ARE IMPORTANT TO
WAWXj3GE9Tg,256022,259892,KEEP IN PLACE WHILE WE LOOK AT
WAWXj3GE9Tg,259892,261493,THE SITUATION AT THE BORDER.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,261493,264063,THERE IS NO REPERCUSSIONS WHERE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,264063,266132,PEOPLE WILL RETURN UNDER TITLE
WAWXj3GE9Tg,266132,267266,EIGHT OR TITLE 42.
WAWXj3GE9Tg,267266,268868,THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP COMING
