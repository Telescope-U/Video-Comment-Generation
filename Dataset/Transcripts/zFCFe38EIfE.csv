zFCFe38EIfE,290,4140,- I think it's easier for you as an inexperienced designer
zFCFe38EIfE,4140,5720,to come up with something different.
zFCFe38EIfE,5720,7640,"Hi, I'm James Dyson,"
zFCFe38EIfE,7640,10240,I'm here to answer your questions from Twitter.
zFCFe38EIfE,10240,12158,"This is ""Design Support""."
zFCFe38EIfE,12158,15325,[deep rhythmic music]
zFCFe38EIfE,16680,20960,"So first up from @muratdemirbas, ""What is the best designed,"
zFCFe38EIfE,20960,23990,"joy to use product in your life?"""
zFCFe38EIfE,23990,25619,And I've got it right here
zFCFe38EIfE,25620,29350,and I bought it in Japan about 30 years ago.
zFCFe38EIfE,29350,31380,What makes this pencil sharpener special
zFCFe38EIfE,31380,33570,and better than all the ones I've come across?
zFCFe38EIfE,33570,35250,The other ones are plastic
zFCFe38EIfE,35250,36890,"and often when you put the pencil in,"
zFCFe38EIfE,36890,38480,the thing topples over.
zFCFe38EIfE,38480,42000,Whereas this is made of cast aluminium so it's very heavy.
zFCFe38EIfE,42000,44110,And actually it was quite heavy to carry home from the shop
zFCFe38EIfE,44110,45570,and bring all the way back from Japan.
zFCFe38EIfE,45570,48770,"It just works very well, doesn't slip around on the table."
zFCFe38EIfE,48770,51920,"Looks good, has got spots to store pencils in it"
zFCFe38EIfE,51920,55440,and it's worked for me unfailingly for 30 years.
zFCFe38EIfE,55440,58469,The joy of putting this in [motor whirring]
zFCFe38EIfE,58470,61303,"and coming out with a lovely, sharp end"
zFCFe38EIfE,61303,64510,"and the noise it makes, it's just delightful."
zFCFe38EIfE,64510,65967,"This one's from @Rarst,"
zFCFe38EIfE,65967,69150,"""What is the worst designed appliance you own?"""
zFCFe38EIfE,69150,73280,And that's a really easy one to answer and it's a printer.
zFCFe38EIfE,73280,76257,"That next question is from @DougCollinsUX,"
zFCFe38EIfE,76257,79550,"""Who are your design heroes and why?"""
zFCFe38EIfE,79550,81320,"Well, one of my design heroes"
zFCFe38EIfE,81320,84050,is Alec Issigonis who designed the Mini.
zFCFe38EIfE,84050,85650,"What I really like about the Mini,"
zFCFe38EIfE,85650,88560,"which is also true of the Walkman,"
zFCFe38EIfE,88560,90610,is when they did some research
zFCFe38EIfE,90610,93390,"to find out whether the Mini would sell,"
zFCFe38EIfE,93390,96970,"this tiny car only 10 foot long with tiny wheels,"
zFCFe38EIfE,96970,99290,the market research said it wouldn't sell.
zFCFe38EIfE,99290,102700,Nobody would want a car with silly little wheels like that.
zFCFe38EIfE,102700,104399,It was just too small.
zFCFe38EIfE,104400,105280,"Of course, ultimately,"
zFCFe38EIfE,105280,107690,it became one of the best selling cars in history
zFCFe38EIfE,107690,110010,and was still being made 50 years later.
zFCFe38EIfE,110010,114480,What I really like about that is that the car he designed
zFCFe38EIfE,114480,117960,looks as good today as it did in the late 50s
zFCFe38EIfE,117960,120060,and that's because it's not styled.
zFCFe38EIfE,120060,122500,It's the sort of opposite of Harley Earl.
zFCFe38EIfE,122500,124580,Harley Earl is the sort of designer I hate
zFCFe38EIfE,124580,127750,because it's all fancy wings and it's very showy.
zFCFe38EIfE,127750,131327,It's design put there to appeal to people to make it sell.
zFCFe38EIfE,131327,132860,"And this is another,"
zFCFe38EIfE,132860,134640,and the interesting thing about the Sony Walkman
zFCFe38EIfE,134640,138640,is that it's a tape recorder that won't record.
zFCFe38EIfE,138640,140560,"And that's really, really brave"
zFCFe38EIfE,140560,142560,"because again they went and asked people,"
zFCFe38EIfE,142560,145390,do you want to buy this tape recorder that doesn't record?
zFCFe38EIfE,145390,146620,It just plays back.
zFCFe38EIfE,146620,148720,"And everybody said, no and absolute nonsense,"
zFCFe38EIfE,148720,151090,everybody wants a tape recorder that can record.
zFCFe38EIfE,151090,154260,But Akio Morita at Sony had the bravery to see
zFCFe38EIfE,154260,157739,"that actually, although no one says they want it"
zFCFe38EIfE,157740,159280,he believed they would want it
zFCFe38EIfE,159280,160990,because they could put it in their pocket
zFCFe38EIfE,160990,163400,"and play music with earphones,"
zFCFe38EIfE,163400,166069,which no one had ever really been able to do before.
zFCFe38EIfE,166070,168500,The next one's quite funny. [laughs]
zFCFe38EIfE,168500,170563,"The next questions from @salvatoreDOTcom,"
zFCFe38EIfE,171950,175300,"he says, ""How does suction even like work?"""
zFCFe38EIfE,175300,180300,You create suction by developing a very highspeed airflow.
zFCFe38EIfE,180340,184080,"So, you have an electric motor here and a turbine here"
zFCFe38EIfE,184080,186200,"and if you turn that very, very fast,"
zFCFe38EIfE,186200,189910,"and we go about 130,000 RPM with that,"
zFCFe38EIfE,189910,193370,the air is drawn in to the center here
zFCFe38EIfE,193370,197560,and spun out of the periphery of that turbine
zFCFe38EIfE,197560,199069,at great speed.
zFCFe38EIfE,199070,203740,"And it's so fast that it draws in more and more air,"
zFCFe38EIfE,203740,207880,"huge amounts of air, and expels them at very high speed"
zFCFe38EIfE,207880,212340,"and if you're drawing in a lot of air into this device,"
zFCFe38EIfE,212340,216170,"you're creating suction, so that's what suction is."
zFCFe38EIfE,216170,218527,Next question is from @JoseOrtega.
zFCFe38EIfE,218527,220049,"""Product Designers,"
zFCFe38EIfE,220050,222450,"what was your biggest challenge to overcome,"
zFCFe38EIfE,222450,224400,lack of experience?
zFCFe38EIfE,224400,225810,"How did you overcome it?"""
zFCFe38EIfE,225810,226642,Very interestingly
zFCFe38EIfE,226643,229050,I think a lack of experience is a great help.
zFCFe38EIfE,229050,231780,An expert thinks he knows it all
zFCFe38EIfE,231780,233600,but he's also rather inhibited
zFCFe38EIfE,233600,236100,"by his experience, his knowledge,"
zFCFe38EIfE,236100,240540,and he finds it difficult to steer off the well-known path.
zFCFe38EIfE,240540,244329,Whereas if you have a lack of experience but huge curiosity
zFCFe38EIfE,244330,247660,"and you approach your new challenge with naivety,"
zFCFe38EIfE,247660,252240,I think it's easier for you as an inexperienced designer
zFCFe38EIfE,252240,253880,to come up with something different
zFCFe38EIfE,253880,255800,and to follow a different path.
zFCFe38EIfE,255800,256799,I'll give an example.
zFCFe38EIfE,256799,258669,When I started to develop
zFCFe38EIfE,258670,262380,"my cyclonic vacuum cleaner separation systems,"
zFCFe38EIfE,262380,265580,"separating dust from air, I went to the experts"
zFCFe38EIfE,265580,267909,and they said you'll never make a cyclone
zFCFe38EIfE,267910,272910,that clears dust out of air below 20 microns.
zFCFe38EIfE,273140,275310,And 20 microns is a bit too big
zFCFe38EIfE,275310,278080,"because a lot of dust is like cigarette smoke,"
zFCFe38EIfE,278080,280539,it's half a micron or 0.3 of a micron.
zFCFe38EIfE,280540,284780,"But because of my naivety, I thought, well, maybe he's wrong"
zFCFe38EIfE,284780,286620,"and I'll try and make it work,"
zFCFe38EIfE,286620,290199,so 5 1/2 thousand prototypes later I had made it work
zFCFe38EIfE,290200,294180,and I'd got it down from 20 microns down to 0.3 of a micron.
zFCFe38EIfE,294180,298320,I advanced the science from being a complete novice.
zFCFe38EIfE,298320,299607,"From @mrs_sloperrrr,"
zFCFe38EIfE,299607,303370,"""What do I do if I have an invention idea?"""
zFCFe38EIfE,303370,306040,The first thing you should do is build a prototype
zFCFe38EIfE,306040,308260,"and as soon as you have a product that works,"
zFCFe38EIfE,308260,310350,you should then file for a patent.
zFCFe38EIfE,310350,314560,If you go and file the patent before you've made it work
zFCFe38EIfE,314560,315780,you could get into trouble
zFCFe38EIfE,315780,320720,because a patent has to be of a product or a technology
zFCFe38EIfE,320720,323430,or an engineering idea that works
zFCFe38EIfE,323430,325729,and you have to prove that it works.
zFCFe38EIfE,325730,326820,And I'm sometimes asked
zFCFe38EIfE,326820,330450,whether you can contract out the making of a prototype
zFCFe38EIfE,330450,334010,"to a development company or a model builder or something,"
zFCFe38EIfE,334010,335490,and indeed you can do that.
zFCFe38EIfE,335490,337800,"And if it's a purely visual model,"
zFCFe38EIfE,337800,340479,I think that's a perfectly good thing to do
zFCFe38EIfE,340480,342570,but if it's anything mechanical
zFCFe38EIfE,342570,344040,"or something that has to work,"
zFCFe38EIfE,344040,347300,"or has a technology that you've got to make to work,"
zFCFe38EIfE,347300,349509,"it's much, much better you do it yourself."
zFCFe38EIfE,349510,351810,"Because when you come to,"
zFCFe38EIfE,351810,353440,"and I hope you don't ever have to do it,"
zFCFe38EIfE,353440,355340,"but you have to fight a patent action,"
zFCFe38EIfE,355340,356639,one of the first things
zFCFe38EIfE,356640,359660,"that the person you're accusing of copying will say to you,"
zFCFe38EIfE,359660,361260,"or their lawyers will say to you,"
zFCFe38EIfE,361260,363490,did you build that prototype yourself?
zFCFe38EIfE,363490,364509,What they'll trying and argue
zFCFe38EIfE,364510,366540,"is that you didn't make the invention at all,"
zFCFe38EIfE,366540,368520,it was the person who built the prototype
zFCFe38EIfE,368520,369770,who made the invention.
zFCFe38EIfE,369770,372830,"I also think that the act of making it yourself,"
zFCFe38EIfE,372830,374930,"actually physically making the prototype,"
zFCFe38EIfE,374930,376860,it's vital to do that yourself
zFCFe38EIfE,376860,379080,so you fully understand what you're doing
zFCFe38EIfE,379080,382340,"and when it fails, as it probably will, as mine always do,"
zFCFe38EIfE,382340,384949,I understand why it's failed
zFCFe38EIfE,384950,388230,and I get an idea as to how I might make it work.
zFCFe38EIfE,388230,390857,The next one's from @franklagendijk.

zFCFe38EIfE,400200,402360,"The biggest challenge is speed,"

zFCFe38EIfE,404320,406980,"It takes, nowadays, a lot of people."
zFCFe38EIfE,406980,409250,You have to have a lot of mechanical designers
zFCFe38EIfE,409250,410300,and product designers
zFCFe38EIfE,410300,412960,"but also you have to have a lot of fluid dynamics,"
zFCFe38EIfE,412960,417173,"motor engineers, software people, ballistics people."
zFCFe38EIfE,417174,418810,You have to have a whole host of people

zFCFe38EIfE,421550,424479,And increasingly because other countries

zFCFe38EIfE,427040,429020,we've got to compete with that.
zFCFe38EIfE,429020,432199,"So, I would say our biggest single issue"
zFCFe38EIfE,432200,434100,is that we've got to do things quicker.

zFCFe38EIfE,448430,452320,"that go at 120, 140,000 RPM."
zFCFe38EIfE,452320,456890,Any fast turbine moving air is noisy. Think of jet engines.

zFCFe38EIfE,476520,478460,A bladeless fan came about
zFCFe38EIfE,478460,482470,because we were looking at airflow technology.
zFCFe38EIfE,482470,485083,"If you let out a small blade of air,"
zFCFe38EIfE,485083,489070,"a very high speed jet of air along a particular surface,"
zFCFe38EIfE,489070,492180,"actually a surface not unlike an aircraft wing,"
zFCFe38EIfE,492180,495740,we noticed that it sucked in from behind it
zFCFe38EIfE,495740,497669,a lot of extra air.
zFCFe38EIfE,497670,501350,"And we did a circular blade, annulars we call it,"
zFCFe38EIfE,501350,502470,outlet of air.
zFCFe38EIfE,502470,504880,"Very tiny, it was only a mil and a half wide,"
zFCFe38EIfE,504880,505713,and we noticed
zFCFe38EIfE,505713,509180,that it increased the original air flow by 20 times.
zFCFe38EIfE,509180,512610,"In the process the airflow was very smooth,"
zFCFe38EIfE,512610,514899,it wasn't interrupted or turbulent.
zFCFe38EIfE,514900,519300,Whereas a fan with blades gives turbulent air
zFCFe38EIfE,519300,522120,"and, of course, a blade is dangerous."
zFCFe38EIfE,522120,524219,Bladed fans are very difficult to clean.
zFCFe38EIfE,524219,526689,"They have their motor in the center of the fan,"
zFCFe38EIfE,526690,530140,so the fan is top heavy and it sort of slumps.
zFCFe38EIfE,530140,535040,"So, we put the motor at the base so the fan was very stable"
zFCFe38EIfE,535040,538029,"and we had it rotate around its center of gravity,"
zFCFe38EIfE,538030,541890,"so whatever position you put it in, it stayed there."
zFCFe38EIfE,541890,544570,So that's really how the fan came about.
zFCFe38EIfE,544570,546710,It was a very difficult product to launch
zFCFe38EIfE,546710,548940,because when we showed it to people

zFCFe38EIfE,634420,637450,it's the only protection that inventors have
zFCFe38EIfE,637450,639560,and it's the only system inventors have.
zFCFe38EIfE,639560,641390,It's far from perfect.
zFCFe38EIfE,641390,645960,"It was dreamt up by Henry IV in 1485, I think it was,"
zFCFe38EIfE,645960,648220,and it's stayed the same for 600 years
zFCFe38EIfE,648220,649410,and the 20 year life
zFCFe38EIfE,649410,652190,is exactly the same as it was 600 years ago.
zFCFe38EIfE,652190,654810,"So, it jolly well needs an overhaul"
zFCFe38EIfE,654810,657750,and it's a system that's desperately unfair
zFCFe38EIfE,657750,661050,for the individual inventor or the small business.
zFCFe38EIfE,661050,663325,Next question's from @behoff
zFCFe38EIfE,663325,664247,"and it's a very interesting one,"
zFCFe38EIfE,664247,666930,"""What's the most important element of design"
zFCFe38EIfE,666930,668140,"in your opinion?"""
zFCFe38EIfE,668140,669530,"So I'm going to give you my opinion,"
zFCFe38EIfE,669530,672010,which is very different to lots of other people's opinions.
zFCFe38EIfE,672010,675430,"When I was at the Royal College of Art being taught design,"
zFCFe38EIfE,675430,677310,I discovered engineering
zFCFe38EIfE,677310,680070,and I couldn't understand why engineering
zFCFe38EIfE,680070,682250,was separated from design.
zFCFe38EIfE,682250,683083,Why did you have
zFCFe38EIfE,683083,687850,a white-coated engineer in a lab developing technology
zFCFe38EIfE,687850,690579,and a designer in a separate design studio
zFCFe38EIfE,690580,692180,often completely unrelated
zFCFe38EIfE,692180,695320,"to the company developing the product or technology,"
zFCFe38EIfE,695320,696530,designing the product?
zFCFe38EIfE,696530,699820,"So, I thought design should be part of engineering,"
zFCFe38EIfE,699820,702060,like Alec Issigonis with his Mini.
zFCFe38EIfE,702060,706040,So I see design as being everything about a product
zFCFe38EIfE,706040,710839,from the technology to the engineering to the design
zFCFe38EIfE,710840,714560,"to how ergonomic it is, how well it performs"
zFCFe38EIfE,714560,717360,and how long it lasts and what materials it use
zFCFe38EIfE,717360,719230,and whether it's sustainable or not.
zFCFe38EIfE,719230,720720,So I see design
zFCFe38EIfE,720720,724399,covering this whole broad range of disciplines
zFCFe38EIfE,724400,726720,and bringing it all together in a seamless
zFCFe38EIfE,726720,728370,and uninterrupted way.
zFCFe38EIfE,728370,729720,"Well, that's it for now."
zFCFe38EIfE,729720,731089,"They were really good questions,"
zFCFe38EIfE,731090,733830,absolutely the right questions to be answering
zFCFe38EIfE,733830,735070,and look forward to next time.
zFCFe38EIfE,735070,736393,Goodbye.
