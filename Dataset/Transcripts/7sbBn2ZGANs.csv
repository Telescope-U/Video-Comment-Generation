7sbBn2ZGANs,0,1979,the Statue of Liberty who stood tall
7sbBn2ZGANs,1979,4560,over New York Harbor since 1886 that's
7sbBn2ZGANs,4560,7140,more than 135 years but now a new art
7sbBn2ZGANs,7140,8880,project just across the river is taking
7sbBn2ZGANs,8880,11040,a more casual look at some of New York's
7sbBn2ZGANs,11040,13620,most iconic figures reclining Liberty
7sbBn2ZGANs,13620,16020,turns Lady Liberty on her side giving
7sbBn2ZGANs,16020,18960,her feet so much needed rest I guess the
7sbBn2ZGANs,18960,20820,sculpture by artist Zach Landsberg is
7sbBn2ZGANs,20820,22619,now on display at Liberty State Park in
7sbBn2ZGANs,22619,24960,Jersey City in the shadow of the actual
7sbBn2ZGANs,24960,27480,statue reclining Liberty is much smaller
7sbBn2ZGANs,27480,29039,in size obviously but has the familiar
7sbBn2ZGANs,29039,31260,oxidized finish of our beloved national
7sbBn2ZGANs,31260,33420,symbol the statue's position gives you
7sbBn2ZGANs,33420,35100,was a chance to get up close and
7sbBn2ZGANs,35100,36719,personal with Lady Liberty from her
7sbBn2ZGANs,36719,39540,Regal Crown down to her toes and here
7sbBn2ZGANs,39540,42120,now to join me and explain the message
7sbBn2ZGANs,42120,44820,behind the work is Zach Landsberg he's a
7sbBn2ZGANs,44820,46920,new york-based sculpture artist known
7sbBn2ZGANs,46920,48960,for taking objects and giving them a
7sbBn2ZGANs,48960,50640,different spin welcome Zach thanks for
7sbBn2ZGANs,50640,51539,being here
7sbBn2ZGANs,51539,53940,oh thanks for having me first of all
7sbBn2ZGANs,53940,56039,when we have reclining Liberty in that
7sbBn2ZGANs,56039,57840,picture what are you trying to say the
7sbBn2ZGANs,57840,59160,statue was originally on display in
7sbBn2ZGANs,59160,60539,Manhattan but recently moved to Jersey
7sbBn2ZGANs,60539,62699,City so what what are you trying to say
7sbBn2ZGANs,62699,65518,in this particular case
7sbBn2ZGANs,65518,68340,well the the way it's set up says a lie
7sbBn2ZGANs,68340,69659,in that
7sbBn2ZGANs,69659,73619,it's literally on in the grass on the
7sbBn2ZGANs,73619,77280,ground at human levels the eye level is
7sbBn2ZGANs,77280,80220,about five feet so at eye level with the
7sbBn2ZGANs,80220,82920,viewer there's no take it to admission
7sbBn2ZGANs,82920,85259,there's no Ferry there's no pedestal you
7sbBn2ZGANs,85259,87439,can go right up and touch it so I think
7sbBn2ZGANs,87439,90799,uh the original Statue is
7sbBn2ZGANs,90799,93780,literally and figuratively above you
7sbBn2ZGANs,93780,96840,this idea the ideals of freedom and
7sbBn2ZGANs,96840,100680,liberty I think I want to say maybe that
7sbBn2ZGANs,100680,102180,they're not Out Of Reach and
7sbBn2ZGANs,102180,103799,unattainable but maybe that they're
7sbBn2ZGANs,103799,105360,little things that we need to do every
7sbBn2ZGANs,105360,108240,day and that we everybody can touch them
7sbBn2ZGANs,108240,110820,a little bit every day now you you are
7sbBn2ZGANs,110820,112320,taking an icon of a love symbol of our
7sbBn2ZGANs,112320,113939,country putting her on the ground have
7sbBn2ZGANs,113939,115680,you gotten any negative feedback from
7sbBn2ZGANs,115680,117860,that
7sbBn2ZGANs,118020,120000,not so much
7sbBn2ZGANs,120000,121560,um I feel
7sbBn2ZGANs,121560,124380,that I mean the you know the original
7sbBn2ZGANs,124380,126840,Statue and mine as well people tend to
7sbBn2ZGANs,126840,129660,project what they're feeling on it uh
7sbBn2ZGANs,129660,133080,when we initially set it up in Harlem uh
7sbBn2ZGANs,133080,135599,a year and a month ago
7sbBn2ZGANs,135599,137280,people were getting their kobit shots so
7sbBn2ZGANs,137280,139140,they said that she was tired because she
7sbBn2ZGANs,139140,141780,got her second covet shot you know when
7sbBn2ZGANs,141780,143580,they're
7sbBn2ZGANs,143580,145080,um you know feeling like things need to
7sbBn2ZGANs,145080,147180,be done people project what they need to
7sbBn2ZGANs,147180,148800,uh
7sbBn2ZGANs,148800,150360,they feel like she needs to get up
7sbBn2ZGANs,150360,152099,because they feel like they need to get
7sbBn2ZGANs,152099,154200,up with something I'm tired but I can't
7sbBn2ZGANs,154200,155459,get up it's like that old commercial
7sbBn2ZGANs,155459,157140,anyway
7sbBn2ZGANs,157140,158519,um you have plenty of other works on
7sbBn2ZGANs,158519,159599,display and there's one that really
7sbBn2ZGANs,159599,162120,struck me because I'm a queen's guy and
7sbBn2ZGANs,162120,163379,uh the one that stood out to me and
7sbBn2ZGANs,163379,164700,stands out to everybody of course is the
7sbBn2ZGANs,164700,166260,great unisphere
7sbBn2ZGANs,166260,167700,um but you have it and we're going to
7sbBn2ZGANs,167700,169860,show it in a second islands of the
7sbBn2ZGANs,169860,171660,unisphere around the famous unisphere
7sbBn2ZGANs,171660,173879,that's at the central Flushing Meadow
7sbBn2ZGANs,173879,176160,Corona Park uh tell us about the islands
7sbBn2ZGANs,176160,178760,of the unisphere
7sbBn2ZGANs,179040,181980,so a similar idea to the islands you
7sbBn2ZGANs,181980,185340,know the unispheres 1964 World's Fair
7sbBn2ZGANs,185340,189420,space age uh you know America you know
7sbBn2ZGANs,189420,191519,blasting into the future and so again
7sbBn2ZGANs,191519,193260,something giant Monument that's
7sbBn2ZGANs,193260,195120,literally and figuratively above
7sbBn2ZGANs,195120,196800,everybody so I wanted to bring it down
7sbBn2ZGANs,196800,199080,to human scale so I built a bunch of the
7sbBn2ZGANs,199080,200459,islands
7sbBn2ZGANs,200459,204420,at one-to-one scale of the of the
7sbBn2ZGANs,204420,206220,unisphere but put them on the ground in
7sbBn2ZGANs,206220,207900,the grass so you could hang out you
7sbBn2ZGANs,207900,209940,could picnic on them and you can
7sbBn2ZGANs,209940,214799,actually touch what you can see but not
7sbBn2ZGANs,214799,216959,reach above
7sbBn2ZGANs,216959,218519,yeah and you know it's great kids love
7sbBn2ZGANs,218519,220739,that unisphere and they have the ability
7sbBn2ZGANs,220739,222120,to climb on something else aside from
7sbBn2ZGANs,222120,223860,jumping in the water which my kids used
7sbBn2ZGANs,223860,226680,to do uh is really cool the few seconds
7sbBn2ZGANs,226680,228420,we have 30 seconds or so left uh we're
7sbBn2ZGANs,228420,229440,coming up on the fourth of July when
7sbBn2ZGANs,229440,230640,many people come to Liberty State Park
7sbBn2ZGANs,230640,231959,to celebrate what do you hope they'll
7sbBn2ZGANs,231959,233760,take away when they see your art
7sbBn2ZGANs,233760,236459,I think touching it the ability to just
7sbBn2ZGANs,236459,238739,touch it and hang out on it
7sbBn2ZGANs,238739,241439,um yeah I want to convey that yeah these
7sbBn2ZGANs,241439,243540,ideals what America is and everybody's
7sbBn2ZGANs,243540,245700,interpretation of America yeah is not
7sbBn2ZGANs,245700,248159,unreachable but it is something that we
7sbBn2ZGANs,248159,250260,do every day
7sbBn2ZGANs,250260,252180,when something is so iconic and you can
7sbBn2ZGANs,252180,253680,reach out and touch it it really changes
7sbBn2ZGANs,253680,255900,the whole nature of it and this is the
7sbBn2ZGANs,255900,257459,greatness of your art and the artwork
7sbBn2ZGANs,257459,258900,that we see
7sbBn2ZGANs,258900,260579,um Zach what can I tell you this really
7sbBn2ZGANs,260579,262800,cool stuff and um I look forward to
7sbBn2ZGANs,262800,264479,seeing your stuff and good luck in the
7sbBn2ZGANs,264479,265740,future and bring more of this because I
7sbBn2ZGANs,265740,267060,think it's great for the city for all
