cKpMvUmzhJM,67320,70960,carsandbids.com so let's talk s3 this
cKpMvUmzhJM,70960,72799,one is all new like i said fully
cKpMvUmzhJM,72799,75520,redesigned for the 2022 model year and
cKpMvUmzhJM,75520,78159,of course it's based on the audi a3 now
cKpMvUmzhJM,78159,81119,the s3 is only the pretty sporty one if
cKpMvUmzhJM,81119,83600,you want a real high performance version
cKpMvUmzhJM,83600,86000,of this car that would be the rs3 but
cKpMvUmzhJM,86000,88479,it's not out yet audi says later this
cKpMvUmzhJM,88479,91680,summer or early fall but the s3 isn't
cKpMvUmzhJM,91680,94560,exactly slow like i said over 300
cKpMvUmzhJM,94560,97920,horsepower 306 to be precise using the
cKpMvUmzhJM,97920,99920,very same turbo four-cylinder you'll
cKpMvUmzhJM,99920,102880,find in the volkswagen golf r also like
cKpMvUmzhJM,102880,104960,the golf r the s3 comes standard with
cKpMvUmzhJM,104960,106799,all-wheel drive and the two cars have
cKpMvUmzhJM,106799,108880,some pretty similar performance numbers
cKpMvUmzhJM,108880,111520,but there are some key differences which
cKpMvUmzhJM,111520,113920,i'll show you and today i'll also show
cKpMvUmzhJM,113920,116320,you everything else first i'll take you
cKpMvUmzhJM,116320,118560,on a thorough tour of the new s3 and
cKpMvUmzhJM,118560,120560,show you all of its interesting quirks
cKpMvUmzhJM,120560,122719,and features then i'll get it out on the
cKpMvUmzhJM,122719,124880,road and drive it and then i'll give it
cKpMvUmzhJM,124880,128520,a dug score
cKpMvUmzhJM,134160,135840,all right i'm going to start the quirks
cKpMvUmzhJM,135840,137599,and features of the s3 and one of the
cKpMvUmzhJM,137599,139440,big things i want to start with is the
cKpMvUmzhJM,139440,141440,fact that this car addresses a lot of
cKpMvUmzhJM,141440,143599,the issues that i brought up as being
cKpMvUmzhJM,143599,145920,negative points about the golf r i
cKpMvUmzhJM,145920,147520,mentioned earlier that the cars share
cKpMvUmzhJM,147520,149040,the same engine they both have all-wheel
cKpMvUmzhJM,149040,151519,drive they're very similar but this
cKpMvUmzhJM,151519,153920,solves some of the golf r's problems one
cKpMvUmzhJM,153920,155440,of my biggest issues with the golf r was
cKpMvUmzhJM,155440,157200,the materials quality in the interior i
cKpMvUmzhJM,157200,158560,didn't think it was really up to par for
cKpMvUmzhJM,158560,161599,the price point well the s3s is a lot
cKpMvUmzhJM,161599,163360,better you can see this interior very
cKpMvUmzhJM,163360,165760,high quality very modern and luxurious
cKpMvUmzhJM,165760,168080,it looks very nice and frankly it fits
cKpMvUmzhJM,168080,170879,in with a luxury car at this price point
cKpMvUmzhJM,170879,172879,at this level it really looks kind of
cKpMvUmzhJM,172879,174800,like what you'd expect in here now it
cKpMvUmzhJM,174800,177040,isn't perfect there are still some areas
cKpMvUmzhJM,177040,178800,that could use some improvement like the
cKpMvUmzhJM,178800,180720,dashboard i guess this is cheap vinyl
cKpMvUmzhJM,180720,181920,but it really just kind of looks like
cKpMvUmzhJM,181920,183920,plastic it's not all that attractive
cKpMvUmzhJM,183920,185200,same deal on the door panel they have a
cKpMvUmzhJM,185200,187280,little bit more plasticy vinyl than i
cKpMvUmzhJM,187280,188959,would like but there are also some nice
cKpMvUmzhJM,188959,190640,benefits like these attractive seats
cKpMvUmzhJM,190640,192720,with this like quilted stitched leather
cKpMvUmzhJM,192720,194879,looks very good you have some nice trim
cKpMvUmzhJM,194879,197440,in places some like silvers and gloss
cKpMvUmzhJM,197440,199360,blacks that all look better than what
cKpMvUmzhJM,199360,201920,you find in the golf r now another big
cKpMvUmzhJM,201920,204799,benefit the s3 has over the golf r is
cKpMvUmzhJM,204799,207280,fixed climate controls in the golf r the
cKpMvUmzhJM,207280,208879,climate controls are integrated into the
cKpMvUmzhJM,208879,210799,center screen which isn't great and it's
cKpMvUmzhJM,210799,212560,especially not great in that car because
cKpMvUmzhJM,212560,215040,the center screen usability is not
cKpMvUmzhJM,215040,217040,really all that good to be totally
cKpMvUmzhJM,217040,218640,honest in this car you don't have to
cKpMvUmzhJM,218640,220239,worry about center screen usability
cKpMvUmzhJM,220239,221760,because the climate controls are fixed
cKpMvUmzhJM,221760,223440,in place you can see them here buttons
cKpMvUmzhJM,223440,225519,switches adjust the temperature the
cKpMvUmzhJM,225519,227200,airflow all that stuff you'd normally
cKpMvUmzhJM,227200,229680,use climate controls for there are hard
cKpMvUmzhJM,229680,230879,buttons so you don't have to go into
cKpMvUmzhJM,230879,233120,menus and screens in order to use your
cKpMvUmzhJM,233120,234640,climate controls that's another big plus
cKpMvUmzhJM,234640,236879,the s3 over the golf r and of course
cKpMvUmzhJM,236879,238480,there's another big benefit here which
cKpMvUmzhJM,238480,240799,is for frankly the audi badge even
cKpMvUmzhJM,240799,242400,though these cars are relatively similar
cKpMvUmzhJM,242400,244159,in a lot of ways the audi badge just
cKpMvUmzhJM,244159,246239,carries more weight carries more respect
cKpMvUmzhJM,246239,248080,more luxury connotations than the
cKpMvUmzhJM,248080,249599,volkswagen badge and although a lot of
cKpMvUmzhJM,249599,251280,car shoppers won't admit to themselves
cKpMvUmzhJM,251280,253599,that's one reason they choose a luxury
cKpMvUmzhJM,253599,256000,brand over a mainstream brand it is and
cKpMvUmzhJM,256000,258160,the audi badge is also helpful in making
cKpMvUmzhJM,258160,260479,this car more appealing than the golf r
cKpMvUmzhJM,260479,262320,and believe it or not probably the
cKpMvUmzhJM,262320,265600,biggest point in favor of the s3
cKpMvUmzhJM,265600,267840,is actually pricing a lot of times when
cKpMvUmzhJM,267840,270160,you're comparing a mainstream model to a
cKpMvUmzhJM,270160,272000,luxury brand model that's based on that
cKpMvUmzhJM,272000,273919,mainstream model a luxury brand is way
cKpMvUmzhJM,273919,276560,more expensive but not in this case a
cKpMvUmzhJM,276560,279680,golf r starts around 44 600 with
cKpMvUmzhJM,279680,283360,shipping this starts at 46 800 with
cKpMvUmzhJM,283360,286880,shipping so this is only 2 000
cKpMvUmzhJM,286880,289360,more and you get an audi instead of a
cKpMvUmzhJM,289360,291680,volkswagen you get an improved interior
cKpMvUmzhJM,291680,292479,and
cKpMvUmzhJM,292479,294160,improved tech at least for the climate
cKpMvUmzhJM,294160,297199,controls so there's not really a huge
cKpMvUmzhJM,297199,299520,drawback to choosing the s3 over the
cKpMvUmzhJM,299520,302160,golf r now with that said there are some
cKpMvUmzhJM,302160,304479,benefits of the golf r over the s3 and
cKpMvUmzhJM,304479,307039,one is very obvious right back here the
cKpMvUmzhJM,307039,309600,s3 has a trunk whereas the golf r of
cKpMvUmzhJM,309600,311520,course is a hatchback now for some car
cKpMvUmzhJM,311520,313199,enthusiasts that ends the discussion
cKpMvUmzhJM,313199,315039,right there because a lot of car people
cKpMvUmzhJM,315039,317199,prefer hatchbacks just generally to
cKpMvUmzhJM,317199,319199,sedans and they would pick the golf r
cKpMvUmzhJM,319199,321199,just because of that but even if you're
cKpMvUmzhJM,321199,322720,open to both body styles of course the
cKpMvUmzhJM,322720,324880,hatchback is more practical than a sedan
cKpMvUmzhJM,324880,326960,it has more space in back for cargo for
cKpMvUmzhJM,326960,329120,stuff if you want to fold down the seats
cKpMvUmzhJM,329120,330880,and so the golf has a little bit more
cKpMvUmzhJM,330880,332960,practicality and then there's the
cKpMvUmzhJM,332960,334639,powertrain these cars have the same
cKpMvUmzhJM,334639,336800,engine 2-liter turbo four-cylinder made
cKpMvUmzhJM,336800,338479,it all-wheel drive like i've mentioned
cKpMvUmzhJM,338479,340880,but the golf r has a little bit more
cKpMvUmzhJM,340880,344160,power 315 horsepower in the golf r
cKpMvUmzhJM,344160,347520,versus 306 horsepower in the s3 and the
cKpMvUmzhJM,347520,350120,golf r has more torque this car is at
cKpMvUmzhJM,350120,352639,295 pound-feet of torque the golf r is
cKpMvUmzhJM,352639,355120,at 310 pound-feet so there's an
cKpMvUmzhJM,355120,357280,advantage for horsepower and torque with
cKpMvUmzhJM,357280,359759,a volkswagen however it's important to
cKpMvUmzhJM,359759,361919,point out that acceleration times aren't
cKpMvUmzhJM,361919,363759,really different between the two cars
cKpMvUmzhJM,363759,365440,both of them are quoting in the mid 4
cKpMvUmzhJM,365440,367840,second range 0-60 which is very quick
cKpMvUmzhJM,367840,369440,and neither one seems to have a big
cKpMvUmzhJM,369440,371520,advantage but it is important to note
cKpMvUmzhJM,371520,373680,that transmission is also a big
cKpMvUmzhJM,373680,375840,differentiator between these cars the s3
cKpMvUmzhJM,375840,377840,is only offered with a 7-speed dual
cKpMvUmzhJM,377840,380400,clutch automatic the golf r is also
cKpMvUmzhJM,380400,382240,offered with the same transmission but
cKpMvUmzhJM,382240,384960,you can get a golf r with a manual
cKpMvUmzhJM,384960,386800,transmission if you want so if you want
cKpMvUmzhJM,386800,389360,a manual or if you want a hatchback the
cKpMvUmzhJM,389360,391440,golf r is the one for you otherwise i
cKpMvUmzhJM,391440,393520,see a lot of benefit to the s3 over the
cKpMvUmzhJM,393520,395759,volkswagen bottom next up moving back
cKpMvUmzhJM,395759,397280,inside the s3 i want to go over the rest
cKpMvUmzhJM,397280,399520,of its quirks and features starting with
cKpMvUmzhJM,399520,401520,a rather unusual one on the door panel
cKpMvUmzhJM,401520,403600,that would be the door handle that you
cKpMvUmzhJM,403600,405680,pull to open the door which is very
cKpMvUmzhJM,405680,407440,strangely shaped it's not a loop or like
cKpMvUmzhJM,407440,408720,a traditional door handle it almost
cKpMvUmzhJM,408720,411840,looks like a jagged edge gun pointing
cKpMvUmzhJM,411840,413120,down i'm not really sure if you're
cKpMvUmzhJM,413120,415280,supposed to lift from the bottom or from
cKpMvUmzhJM,415280,417199,the top it's just kind of a strange
cKpMvUmzhJM,417199,420080,thing but it does add some daring style
cKpMvUmzhJM,420080,421919,to this interior but anyway next up
cKpMvUmzhJM,421919,423680,moving a little bit more inside another
cKpMvUmzhJM,423680,425520,unusual control and here is the shift
cKpMvUmzhJM,425520,427199,lever which is actually more like a
cKpMvUmzhJM,427199,429759,shift switch you can see it here you
cKpMvUmzhJM,429759,432400,pull it back for d or drive you push it
cKpMvUmzhJM,432400,435039,up for r reverse neutral's in the middle
cKpMvUmzhJM,435039,436560,and then you access park by pressing
cKpMvUmzhJM,436560,438639,this little rectangular button above all
cKpMvUmzhJM,438639,441199,that sort of strange and unorthodox but
cKpMvUmzhJM,441199,443360,not as strange and unorthodox as the
cKpMvUmzhJM,443360,446240,volume control in this car which is here
cKpMvUmzhJM,446240,448800,you can see there's a circle with some
cKpMvUmzhJM,448800,451360,controls on off mute next and previous
cKpMvUmzhJM,451360,454160,track so where's volume well you slide
cKpMvUmzhJM,454160,456639,your finger in a circle around this
cKpMvUmzhJM,456639,459280,circle in order to turn the volume up or
cKpMvUmzhJM,459280,462639,down it's a very unusual control but
cKpMvUmzhJM,462639,464639,it's actually pretty easy to use once
cKpMvUmzhJM,464639,466319,you figure it out just slide your finger
cKpMvUmzhJM,466319,468560,around and the volume changes and it's
cKpMvUmzhJM,468560,469840,certainly better than having that
cKpMvUmzhJM,469840,471680,integrated into the touchscreen or
cKpMvUmzhJM,471680,473919,little tap tap tap buttons like in some
cKpMvUmzhJM,473919,475360,cars but anyway next up another
cKpMvUmzhJM,475360,477280,interesting interior quirk would be the
cKpMvUmzhJM,477280,479520,sunroof sunroof opens up just like in a
cKpMvUmzhJM,479520,481919,normal car nothing unusual there but you
cKpMvUmzhJM,481919,485199,can close this mesh sunshade when the
cKpMvUmzhJM,485199,488319,sunroof is open so you can have the
cKpMvUmzhJM,488319,490479,sunroof open and wind blowing into the
cKpMvUmzhJM,490479,492720,car but then the mesh sunshade is closed
cKpMvUmzhJM,492720,494000,so you're getting shaded from the sun
cKpMvUmzhJM,494000,495360,but you're still getting the fresh air
cKpMvUmzhJM,495360,497039,from the roof which is pretty cool i
cKpMvUmzhJM,497039,498879,think only volkswagen and audi allow
cKpMvUmzhJM,498879,500319,that the sunshade to close when the
cKpMvUmzhJM,500319,502160,sunroof is open and actually i find
cKpMvUmzhJM,502160,503599,myself enjoying it more and more every
cKpMvUmzhJM,503599,505360,time i'm in one of these cars next up
cKpMvUmzhJM,505360,506560,another interesting quirk in this
cKpMvUmzhJM,506560,507840,interior would be the fact that the
cKpMvUmzhJM,507840,510639,interior itself is very angled take a
cKpMvUmzhJM,510639,512080,look at the dashboard you don't see any
cKpMvUmzhJM,512080,514399,like sweeping curves here like in many
cKpMvUmzhJM,514399,516560,modern cars there's just angles
cKpMvUmzhJM,516560,519120,everywhere straight horizontal and
cKpMvUmzhJM,519120,521919,angles going side to side and hexagons
cKpMvUmzhJM,521919,523599,and everything is angled in here and i
cKpMvUmzhJM,523599,524959,guess it's to give it sort of an
cKpMvUmzhJM,524959,527040,aggressive interior look modern and
cKpMvUmzhJM,527040,528880,maybe even a little bit sporty as
cKpMvUmzhJM,528880,531200,opposed to sweeping curves those are for
cKpMvUmzhJM,531200,535120,old people in the s3 we have angles and
cKpMvUmzhJM,535120,536399,next up another notable item in here
cKpMvUmzhJM,536399,537920,probably the only thing that is curved
cKpMvUmzhJM,537920,539680,the steering wheel i love the steering
cKpMvUmzhJM,539680,541440,wheel on this car i love the little golf
cKpMvUmzhJM,541440,543200,ball texture on the side the part where
cKpMvUmzhJM,543200,544800,you actually grab this is kind of a
cKpMvUmzhJM,544800,546560,hallmark of sporty outies and it's nice
cKpMvUmzhJM,546560,548959,to see it in here too it looks and feels
cKpMvUmzhJM,548959,551440,pretty good but anyway next i want to go
cKpMvUmzhJM,551440,553120,into the infotainment system and i have
cKpMvUmzhJM,553120,555040,to say this is not my very favorite
cKpMvUmzhJM,555040,556560,infotainment system the entire car
cKpMvUmzhJM,556560,558080,industry for one thing it can be a
cKpMvUmzhJM,558080,559839,little bit slow to respond you tap in
cKpMvUmzhJM,559839,561600,and it takes a little longer than some
cKpMvUmzhJM,561600,562640,screens which are a little bit more
cKpMvUmzhJM,562640,564959,immediate also the screen is a little
cKpMvUmzhJM,564959,566399,small and so when you're on the home
cKpMvUmzhJM,566399,569040,screen displaying three items at once
cKpMvUmzhJM,569040,570959,it's a little difficult to really see
cKpMvUmzhJM,570959,572399,everything in all of them it's all kind
cKpMvUmzhJM,572399,574959,of compact a little bit but it does work
cKpMvUmzhJM,574959,576560,relatively well it's reasonably
cKpMvUmzhJM,576560,578000,intuitive to get between various
cKpMvUmzhJM,578000,580000,different items to pair phones or put in
cKpMvUmzhJM,580000,582000,a navigation destination or go to
cKpMvUmzhJM,582000,583279,settings pretty much anything you might
cKpMvUmzhJM,583279,585040,want it's relatively easy in this system
cKpMvUmzhJM,585040,587440,but again not my very favorite though i
cKpMvUmzhJM,587440,589440,am just happy they didn't integrate the
cKpMvUmzhJM,589440,591839,climate controls however any complaints
cKpMvUmzhJM,591839,594240,about this center screen are instantly
cKpMvUmzhJM,594240,596399,forgiven when you go to use the gauge
cKpMvUmzhJM,596399,598880,cluster screen audi kind of pioneered
cKpMvUmzhJM,598880,601120,gauge cluster screens like five years
cKpMvUmzhJM,601120,602959,ago full screen gauge clusters and they
cKpMvUmzhJM,602959,605120,still do it better than basically
cKpMvUmzhJM,605120,607519,anybody else this screen is wonderfully
cKpMvUmzhJM,607519,609760,configurable you can adjust the view to
cKpMvUmzhJM,609760,611920,prioritize basically whatever you want
cKpMvUmzhJM,611920,613200,if you want to see the speed or the
cKpMvUmzhJM,613200,614959,tachometer you can see that a little
cKpMvUmzhJM,614959,616720,larger or if you want to see other
cKpMvUmzhJM,616720,619279,things like music phone whatever you can
cKpMvUmzhJM,619279,621440,choose what you want to display largely
cKpMvUmzhJM,621440,622800,and of course you can always choose to
cKpMvUmzhJM,622800,625200,have the map displayed right there in
cKpMvUmzhJM,625200,627519,the gauge cluster full screen full color
cKpMvUmzhJM,627519,629760,full resolution it's a fantastic thing
cKpMvUmzhJM,629760,632000,and it's really really easy to use and
cKpMvUmzhJM,632000,634079,it also cuts down on some of your use of
cKpMvUmzhJM,634079,635839,the center infotainment screen since so
cKpMvUmzhJM,635839,637440,much good information is right in front
cKpMvUmzhJM,637440,639519,of you you don't have to use the kind of
cKpMvUmzhJM,639519,642079,lesser screen in my opinion quite as
cKpMvUmzhJM,642079,643839,often by the way one interesting quirk
cKpMvUmzhJM,643839,645760,worth noting in this screen i still love
cKpMvUmzhJM,645760,647839,that audi refers to the trip odometers
cKpMvUmzhJM,647839,651440,not as like trip a or trip b but instead
cKpMvUmzhJM,651440,655120,short term memory and long term memory
cKpMvUmzhJM,655120,657839,giving some personification to the gauge
cKpMvUmzhJM,657839,660399,cluster screen trip odometer situation
cKpMvUmzhJM,660399,662320,in your s3 also interesting in this
cKpMvUmzhJM,662320,663920,vicinity i like the fact that you have a
cKpMvUmzhJM,663920,666000,hidden storage compartment over here to
cKpMvUmzhJM,666000,667040,the left of the steering wheel you see
cKpMvUmzhJM,667040,669279,there's this little panel you open it up
cKpMvUmzhJM,669279,672000,and that's where you can store stuff and
cKpMvUmzhJM,672000,674399,it's actually pretty big and relatively
cKpMvUmzhJM,674399,675839,useful you get a little ticket at a
cKpMvUmzhJM,675839,677440,parking garage or you have your parking
cKpMvUmzhJM,677440,679440,garage card stuff like that you just
cKpMvUmzhJM,679440,680880,want to keep over there you have a
cKpMvUmzhJM,680880,682640,pocket just for the driver it's kind of
cKpMvUmzhJM,682640,684480,nice but anyway next we move into the
cKpMvUmzhJM,684480,686720,back seat of the s3 and i have to say
cKpMvUmzhJM,686720,688880,it's pretty small the back seat is not
cKpMvUmzhJM,688880,690480,especially sizable back here i moved the
cKpMvUmzhJM,690480,692160,front seat up to get back here my knees
cKpMvUmzhJM,692160,693760,are still pushing into it digging into
cKpMvUmzhJM,693760,695279,it my head is right up against the
cKpMvUmzhJM,695279,697680,ceiling but that's all pretty common in
cKpMvUmzhJM,697680,699920,a vehicle like this ultimately these s3s
cKpMvUmzhJM,699920,701920,are mainly purchased by single people or
cKpMvUmzhJM,701920,703120,couples who aren't going to be
cKpMvUmzhJM,703120,704640,transporting people and especially
cKpMvUmzhJM,704640,706399,adults in the back seat very often they
cKpMvUmzhJM,706399,708480,want it here just for occasional use and
cKpMvUmzhJM,708480,710240,this back seat does work for occasional
cKpMvUmzhJM,710240,712639,use or for kids adults for short trips
cKpMvUmzhJM,712639,713839,it's not something you'd want to use
cKpMvUmzhJM,713839,716480,often for adults but it works in a pinch
cKpMvUmzhJM,716480,718480,anyway a couple of interesting items in
cKpMvUmzhJM,718480,720959,this back seat one you have climate
cKpMvUmzhJM,720959,722959,vents back here which is pretty nice for
cKpMvUmzhJM,722959,725120,a car like this you even have climate
cKpMvUmzhJM,725120,727120,control temperature this little wheel
cKpMvUmzhJM,727120,729519,lets you adjust from cold to hot you
cKpMvUmzhJM,729519,731200,don't get to adjust the amount of
cKpMvUmzhJM,731200,733680,climate control like the fan speed but i
cKpMvUmzhJM,733680,735760,will take climate vents in a temperature
cKpMvUmzhJM,735760,737440,adjuster especially in the back of a
cKpMvUmzhJM,737440,739040,little car like this you don't usually
cKpMvUmzhJM,739040,740959,see that now you can also see back here
cKpMvUmzhJM,740959,743680,you have usb-c ports for device charging
cKpMvUmzhJM,743680,746880,which is a nice modern device charging
cKpMvUmzhJM,746880,749519,situation in the back of this car other
cKpMvUmzhJM,749519,751519,than the stuff in the center though not
cKpMvUmzhJM,751519,753279,really all that much interesting about
cKpMvUmzhJM,753279,755760,this back seat although i must say it
cKpMvUmzhJM,755760,758320,too has a materials quality advantage
cKpMvUmzhJM,758320,760639,over the golf r one of my complaints
cKpMvUmzhJM,760639,762480,about the golf r's materials was that
cKpMvUmzhJM,762480,764720,they cheaped out in the back seat and a
cKpMvUmzhJM,764720,766079,great example of that was on the door
cKpMvUmzhJM,766079,767600,panel you can see the front door panels
cKpMvUmzhJM,767600,770720,had simply higher quality materials than
cKpMvUmzhJM,770720,772240,the back door panels they had
cKpMvUmzhJM,772240,775440,specifically de-contented the rear doors
cKpMvUmzhJM,775440,777120,just to save a few bucks and it was
cKpMvUmzhJM,777120,779200,cynical and it looked bad they didn't do
cKpMvUmzhJM,779200,781200,that in the s3 you can see the door
cKpMvUmzhJM,781200,783040,panels still have the same quality same
cKpMvUmzhJM,783040,785040,materials same trim which is obviously
cKpMvUmzhJM,785040,787120,nicer and the back seats have the same
cKpMvUmzhJM,787120,788720,quilted leather as you had up front
cKpMvUmzhJM,788720,790560,which also looks very nice very
cKpMvUmzhJM,790560,792399,luxurious even though these back seats
cKpMvUmzhJM,792399,794320,probably won't get used all that often
cKpMvUmzhJM,794320,796639,it's the mark of a luxury car but anyway
cKpMvUmzhJM,796639,798560,next we move around back in the s3 and
cKpMvUmzhJM,798560,801040,it is worth pointing out again the s3 is
cKpMvUmzhJM,801040,803200,not as practical as the golf r by being
cKpMvUmzhJM,803200,804959,a sedan with a trunk instead of a
cKpMvUmzhJM,804959,807839,hatchback with a cargo area the s3 just
cKpMvUmzhJM,807839,809839,has a little disadvantage here but it
cKpMvUmzhJM,809839,811279,should be pointed out that the s3's
cKpMvUmzhJM,811279,813440,trunk is pretty big you pop it open and
cKpMvUmzhJM,813440,814880,you can see it's a fairly large trunk
cKpMvUmzhJM,814880,817440,especially for a compact car like this
cKpMvUmzhJM,817440,820000,it has some pretty good space although i
cKpMvUmzhJM,820000,821680,should point out that the trunk is sort
cKpMvUmzhJM,821680,823920,of disappointingly basic for a couple
cKpMvUmzhJM,823920,825760,reasons one there's no trunk mounted
cKpMvUmzhJM,825760,827839,releases back here to fold down the back
cKpMvUmzhJM,827839,829440,seat you don't have like a latch you can
cKpMvUmzhJM,829440,831600,pull to unlatch the back seat so you can
cKpMvUmzhJM,831600,833360,fold it down the back seat does fold
cKpMvUmzhJM,833360,835120,down but most new cars where i'm getting
cKpMvUmzhJM,835120,836880,the trunk they have a latch back here
cKpMvUmzhJM,836880,838880,you can pull and it just pops the back
cKpMvUmzhJM,838880,840079,seats down and that would be nice to
cKpMvUmzhJM,840079,841920,have here it's also a little bit
cKpMvUmzhJM,841920,843839,disappointing that there's no under
cKpMvUmzhJM,843839,846399,trunk floor storage back here so many
cKpMvUmzhJM,846399,847920,new cars have that but if you lift up
cKpMvUmzhJM,847920,849839,the floor and the s3's trunk the battery
cKpMvUmzhJM,849839,851199,is here now they do that for weight
cKpMvUmzhJM,851199,853040,distribution to make the car less front
cKpMvUmzhJM,853040,854480,heavy and so from a performance
cKpMvUmzhJM,854480,856560,perspective that's a good thing but it'd
cKpMvUmzhJM,856560,859360,be nice to have underfloor storage so
cKpMvUmzhJM,859360,861600,you can keep items separated if you want
cKpMvUmzhJM,861600,864399,to like so many cars offer but anyway
cKpMvUmzhJM,864399,866480,next up since i'm outside the s3 i want
cKpMvUmzhJM,866480,869040,to talk over the exterior a little more
cKpMvUmzhJM,869040,870959,generally specifically the design and
cKpMvUmzhJM,870959,873839,style of this car frankly i really like
cKpMvUmzhJM,873839,876320,it and i like the golf r also for the
cKpMvUmzhJM,876320,878720,same reason it's subtle it's simple this
cKpMvUmzhJM,878720,881360,is a fun fast performance car but it
cKpMvUmzhJM,881360,883839,doesn't shout to everybody how fast it
cKpMvUmzhJM,883839,886000,is with all sorts of scoops and inlets
cKpMvUmzhJM,886000,887920,and wings like some of these cars do
cKpMvUmzhJM,887920,890959,it's nice and subtle and simple and
cKpMvUmzhJM,890959,893199,frankly beautiful and i think this car
cKpMvUmzhJM,893199,894959,looks great and the golf r does too
cKpMvUmzhJM,894959,896639,these are some of the better looking
cKpMvUmzhJM,896639,898800,kind of compact performance cars of the
cKpMvUmzhJM,898800,900800,modern era and one other really
cKpMvUmzhJM,900800,903199,important thing that i absolutely love
cKpMvUmzhJM,903199,906800,about this car is the sizing is just
cKpMvUmzhJM,906800,909519,perfect in fact this car kind of reminds
cKpMvUmzhJM,909519,912639,me of a modern take on the old school b5
cKpMvUmzhJM,912639,915440,audi s4 the s4 everybody loved that was
cKpMvUmzhJM,915440,917279,sold at the end of the 90s in the early
cKpMvUmzhJM,917279,921120,2000s that car was 177 inches long and
cKpMvUmzhJM,921120,921880,it had
cKpMvUmzhJM,921880,925600,270 horsepower now the new audi s4 is
cKpMvUmzhJM,925600,927199,also a great car and it's become way
cKpMvUmzhJM,927199,929040,more powerful but it's also gotten
cKpMvUmzhJM,929040,931440,bigger the latest s4 is almost a foot
cKpMvUmzhJM,931440,935360,longer than that old school b5 s4 but
cKpMvUmzhJM,935360,936560,this car
cKpMvUmzhJM,936560,938480,is 177
cKpMvUmzhJM,938480,940959,inches long just like the old b5 and it
cKpMvUmzhJM,940959,941720,has
cKpMvUmzhJM,941720,945680,306 horsepower even more than the b5 s4
cKpMvUmzhJM,945680,948959,this feels like the revival of that very
cKpMvUmzhJM,948959,951600,famous audi from back then the modern
cKpMvUmzhJM,951600,955440,take on the b5 s4 let's just hope this
cKpMvUmzhJM,955440,958480,turns out to be a little more reliable
cKpMvUmzhJM,958480,960079,but anyway next up looking at a few
cKpMvUmzhJM,960079,961600,interesting details on the outside of
cKpMvUmzhJM,961600,963920,this car for one in back you have quad
cKpMvUmzhJM,963920,967199,exhaust four different exhaust tips back
cKpMvUmzhJM,967199,969440,here makes it look like a cool
cKpMvUmzhJM,969440,971839,sporty high performance car which is a
cKpMvUmzhJM,971839,973680,neat look to have and speaking of the
cKpMvUmzhJM,973680,975920,quad exhaust well for one thing all four
cKpMvUmzhJM,975920,977600,of the exhaust pipes are connected you
cKpMvUmzhJM,977600,979839,can see under the car yes they are a
cKpMvUmzhJM,979839,982240,real quad exhaust system audi and other
cKpMvUmzhJM,982240,983759,brands have tried in the past to get
cKpMvUmzhJM,983759,986079,away with like half of the exhaust being
cKpMvUmzhJM,986079,987920,fake but that isn't the case here but
cKpMvUmzhJM,987920,989759,anyway speaking of the quad exhaust they
cKpMvUmzhJM,989759,990560,sound
cKpMvUmzhJM,990560,993360,well okay sporty-ish like you might
cKpMvUmzhJM,993360,997839,expect for this car take a listen
cKpMvUmzhJM,1004240,1006320,and next up these wheels are also
cKpMvUmzhJM,1006320,1008000,interesting they're not especially
cKpMvUmzhJM,1008000,1009759,beautiful or performancy but they look
cKpMvUmzhJM,1009759,1012079,fine the quirky part is that they say
cKpMvUmzhJM,1012079,1015360,audi sport on them just once in red
cKpMvUmzhJM,1015360,1017279,on the side of the wheel just so
cKpMvUmzhJM,1017279,1019839,everybody really knows this is a sport
cKpMvUmzhJM,1019839,1021839,audi also interesting with this car is
cKpMvUmzhJM,1021839,1024240,the way the turn signals work in back i
cKpMvUmzhJM,1024240,1026798,absolutely love these sweeping turn
cKpMvUmzhJM,1026798,1029038,signals you can see them here they are
cKpMvUmzhJM,1029038,1031199,beautiful and eye-catching and it's a
cKpMvUmzhJM,1031199,1033280,really cool thing to do to make even
cKpMvUmzhJM,1033280,1035600,your turn signals look cool now in the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1035600,1038000,past i've told you that audi wasn't able
cKpMvUmzhJM,1038000,1040400,to offer true sweeping turn signals on
cKpMvUmzhJM,1040400,1042959,u.s market cars because our regulation
cKpMvUmzhJM,1042959,1044880,says that a large portion of the turn
cKpMvUmzhJM,1044880,1047678,signal must light up on its first click
cKpMvUmzhJM,1047678,1049919,basically but audi has figured out an
cKpMvUmzhJM,1049919,1051520,interesting way around that if you look
cKpMvUmzhJM,1051520,1053360,closely when these turn signals are on
cKpMvUmzhJM,1053360,1055840,you can see that the entire turn signal
cKpMvUmzhJM,1055840,1059520,lights up with each flash but just dimly
cKpMvUmzhJM,1059520,1061919,and that satisfies the regulation and
cKpMvUmzhJM,1061919,1064799,then the brighter part the sweeping part
cKpMvUmzhJM,1064799,1067440,can do its thing sort of on top of the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1067440,1069200,dim turn signal take a close look and
cKpMvUmzhJM,1069200,1070960,you can see the dim part lights up with
cKpMvUmzhJM,1070960,1073280,each flash and then the sweeper goes
cKpMvUmzhJM,1073280,1075360,across and they figured out a neat way
cKpMvUmzhJM,1075360,1077280,around that kind of stupid regulation so
cKpMvUmzhJM,1077280,1080160,we get our cool sweeping turn signals
cKpMvUmzhJM,1080160,1083440,and so those are the quirks and features
cKpMvUmzhJM,1083440,1086240,of the new audi s3 now it's time to get
cKpMvUmzhJM,1086240,1089200,it out on the road and see how it drives
cKpMvUmzhJM,1089200,1092880,all right driving the new s3
cKpMvUmzhJM,1092880,1094240,now i know that some people watching
cKpMvUmzhJM,1094240,1096240,well it's not the rs3 i'll get to the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1096240,1099760,rs3 but the s3 has a pretty good place
cKpMvUmzhJM,1099760,1101280,in the enthusiast world if you want
cKpMvUmzhJM,1101280,1103280,something that's like sporty and fun but
cKpMvUmzhJM,1103280,1104480,you don't necessarily want to spend the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1104480,1106640,big money or get the crazy power and
cKpMvUmzhJM,1106640,1108640,performance the rs3 this car has a
cKpMvUmzhJM,1108640,1111039,pretty good compromise and years ago i
cKpMvUmzhJM,1111039,1115280,owned a 2001 audi a4 a b5 a4 and like i
cKpMvUmzhJM,1115280,1117600,was saying about the b5 s4 it's that
cKpMvUmzhJM,1117600,1120480,right size like that car was so popular
cKpMvUmzhJM,1120480,1122400,and so desirable back then i think it's
cKpMvUmzhJM,1122400,1124400,reasonable that like a cool sporty car
cKpMvUmzhJM,1124400,1126880,the same size is still a desirable
cKpMvUmzhJM,1126880,1128720,vehicle and it certainly is to me so
cKpMvUmzhJM,1128720,1131200,let's talk s3 now just like the golf r i
cKpMvUmzhJM,1131200,1132640,think the power train is fantastic very
cKpMvUmzhJM,1132640,1134720,punchy very exciting you step on it and
cKpMvUmzhJM,1134720,1137039,it moves uh and it's surprisingly quick
cKpMvUmzhJM,1137039,1139200,0 to 60 in like four and a half 4.6
cKpMvUmzhJM,1139200,1142080,seconds that is a strong strong figure
cKpMvUmzhJM,1142080,1144880,uh for any car obviously and it's pretty
cKpMvUmzhJM,1144880,1146240,nice for a car like this only sort of
cKpMvUmzhJM,1146240,1148400,the mid performance car in this lineup
cKpMvUmzhJM,1148400,1150000,and also when you're accelerating the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1150000,1151840,other thing is it sounds reasonably good
cKpMvUmzhJM,1151840,1153520,from inside the car now it doesn't sound
cKpMvUmzhJM,1153520,1154960,that great on the outside and that rev
cKpMvUmzhJM,1154960,1156640,clip i showed you in part because for
cKpMvUmzhJM,1156640,1158559,some reason when audi's rev in park
cKpMvUmzhJM,1158559,1160720,they're limited to like 3000 rpm or 4000
cKpMvUmzhJM,1160720,1162000,rpm so you can never really hear them
cKpMvUmzhJM,1162000,1163520,all that well when you're inside the car
cKpMvUmzhJM,1163520,1166480,you do get more sound but it's not like
cKpMvUmzhJM,1166480,1168960,exceptionally muscular or growly it
cKpMvUmzhJM,1168960,1171039,ultimately just feels like it sounds
cKpMvUmzhJM,1171039,1173039,like a two-liter four-cylinder but i
cKpMvUmzhJM,1173039,1174080,don't think a lot of people are buying
cKpMvUmzhJM,1174080,1175280,this car for the sound i think they kind
cKpMvUmzhJM,1175280,1176559,of know the score when they're buying it
cKpMvUmzhJM,1176559,1177919,that it's not gonna sound like a real
cKpMvUmzhJM,1177919,1180480,like muscle car the really cool thing
cKpMvUmzhJM,1180480,1182400,about this car in addition to the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1182400,1184640,acceleration being quite astonishingly
cKpMvUmzhJM,1184640,1187440,nice is the handling is fantastic and i
cKpMvUmzhJM,1187440,1189039,said this in that golf r review as well
cKpMvUmzhJM,1189039,1190559,and this car drives a lot like the golf
cKpMvUmzhJM,1190559,1191840,r the steering is good very
cKpMvUmzhJM,1191840,1193760,communicative and precise especially for
cKpMvUmzhJM,1193760,1195360,a vehicle based on a front wheel drive
cKpMvUmzhJM,1195360,1197280,car and i'm pretty impressed with the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1197280,1198559,way that this steers the way that this
cKpMvUmzhJM,1198559,1200960,handles i think it's very well balanced
cKpMvUmzhJM,1200960,1203120,i think it's surprisingly comfortable
cKpMvUmzhJM,1203120,1204960,for a pretty good handling car which is
cKpMvUmzhJM,1204960,1206559,not always easy to do a lot of cars i
cKpMvUmzhJM,1206559,1208480,drive gt3s and porsches and stuff like
cKpMvUmzhJM,1208480,1210480,that they handle incredibly but they it
cKpMvUmzhJM,1210480,1211840,really comes with the sacrifice of ride
cKpMvUmzhJM,1211840,1213280,quality obviously this doesn't handle
cKpMvUmzhJM,1213280,1215760,like those but it still you know it
cKpMvUmzhJM,1215760,1217520,holds its own and it's a reasonably
cKpMvUmzhJM,1217520,1219679,comfortable and nice car now a steering
cKpMvUmzhJM,1219679,1221200,precision isn't quite what it is in like
cKpMvUmzhJM,1221200,1224320,an rs6 or an r7 or a real true sports
cKpMvUmzhJM,1224320,1226159,car and handling there you do feel a
cKpMvUmzhJM,1226159,1227360,little bit of body roll maybe a little
cKpMvUmzhJM,1227360,1228559,bit of understeer but we're not talking
cKpMvUmzhJM,1228559,1230080,about i mean that's it's still quite
cKpMvUmzhJM,1230080,1232240,good considering what this car is and
cKpMvUmzhJM,1232240,1234080,i'm pretty impressed with it uh from a
cKpMvUmzhJM,1234080,1235360,steering handling and drivability
cKpMvUmzhJM,1235360,1236880,perspective really though to me what
cKpMvUmzhJM,1236880,1238400,sticks out about this car is it's a
cKpMvUmzhJM,1238400,1240880,pretty good deal i was lamenting the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1240880,1243120,fact in the golf r review that the golf
cKpMvUmzhJM,1243120,1245760,r cost so much money and i'm still kind
cKpMvUmzhJM,1245760,1247360,of surprised in fact when i saw that
cKpMvUmzhJM,1247360,1248799,this car was only two thousand dollars
cKpMvUmzhJM,1248799,1250799,more expensive base price
cKpMvUmzhJM,1250799,1251600,i
cKpMvUmzhJM,1251600,1254080,i checked like four times like really
cKpMvUmzhJM,1254080,1256080,okay i went on their website
cKpMvUmzhJM,1256080,1258640,really this is okay okay
cKpMvUmzhJM,1258640,1260320,in order to really sell it to me like
cKpMvUmzhJM,1260320,1263039,this car to me offers quite a few more
cKpMvUmzhJM,1263039,1265440,advantages the audi badge is the biggest
cKpMvUmzhJM,1265440,1266720,advantage that's going to sell this car
cKpMvUmzhJM,1266720,1267840,to the most people there are a lot of
cKpMvUmzhJM,1267840,1269200,people out there oh i wouldn't buy a car
cKpMvUmzhJM,1269200,1270559,because a badge i would only buy it
cKpMvUmzhJM,1270559,1272640,because it's the best yeah well when why
cKpMvUmzhJM,1272640,1273919,didn't you buy a kia stinger you know
cKpMvUmzhJM,1273919,1276480,that car would have sold more if if that
cKpMvUmzhJM,1276480,1278000,was really true people want the audi
cKpMvUmzhJM,1278000,1280720,badge so you pay 2 000 more which is
cKpMvUmzhJM,1280720,1283039,really not all that much uh to get the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1283039,1285200,audi badge to get better infotainment
cKpMvUmzhJM,1285200,1287120,the golf r's infotainment and climate
cKpMvUmzhJM,1287120,1288799,control setup has been universally
cKpMvUmzhJM,1288799,1290559,criticized and you get a better interior
cKpMvUmzhJM,1290559,1292080,and the golf r's the latest golf r's
cKpMvUmzhJM,1292080,1293600,interior has also been fairly well
cKpMvUmzhJM,1293600,1295039,criticized and i don't really see quite
cKpMvUmzhJM,1295039,1296320,as many of those problems in the s3 it
cKpMvUmzhJM,1296320,1297919,still could be nicer in here but it's
cKpMvUmzhJM,1297919,1300080,better than the golf r you only lose the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1300080,1302080,hatchback in the manual transmission and
cKpMvUmzhJM,1302080,1303440,the manual is a big deal if you want a
cKpMvUmzhJM,1303440,1304960,manual car that's it that's the ball
cKpMvUmzhJM,1304960,1306400,game it doesn't matter all the drawbacks
cKpMvUmzhJM,1306400,1308320,the golf are you get the golf r um the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1308320,1309760,hatchback thing i think i could live
cKpMvUmzhJM,1309760,1312320,with in order to have an audi spend only
cKpMvUmzhJM,1312320,1314080,two grand more and get
cKpMvUmzhJM,1314080,1316400,a better place to sit frankly where
cKpMvUmzhJM,1316400,1317679,you're where you're spending all your
cKpMvUmzhJM,1317679,1319120,time frankly i think that this car
cKpMvUmzhJM,1319120,1320320,checks a lot of boxes for a lot of
cKpMvUmzhJM,1320320,1321760,people it's little and so it's good for
cKpMvUmzhJM,1321760,1323200,city driving it's nice and compact you
cKpMvUmzhJM,1323200,1324880,can park it anywhere and it's fun and
cKpMvUmzhJM,1324880,1326240,it's fast and it handles well and it's
cKpMvUmzhJM,1326240,1328159,got a lot of nice sporty benefits but
cKpMvUmzhJM,1328159,1330320,it's also like a nice car it's got you
cKpMvUmzhJM,1330320,1331760,know beaded seats dual zone climate
cKpMvUmzhJM,1331760,1333200,control you know all sorts of nice
cKpMvUmzhJM,1333200,1335120,cameras and technology the screen and
cKpMvUmzhJM,1335120,1337280,the in the gauge cluster now obviously
cKpMvUmzhJM,1337280,1339039,i'm very excited to drive the rs3
cKpMvUmzhJM,1339039,1340799,because that's the ultimate cool
cKpMvUmzhJM,1340799,1342720,incredible vehicle but if you're not
cKpMvUmzhJM,1342720,1344480,spending that money or if you don't just
cKpMvUmzhJM,1344480,1347679,need that stuff this car offers a pretty
cKpMvUmzhJM,1347679,1349440,nice compromise and i think it compares
cKpMvUmzhJM,1349440,1352320,quite favorably uh to a golf r as long
cKpMvUmzhJM,1352320,1353760,as you won't miss the hatchback or the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1353760,1355679,stick shift and so
cKpMvUmzhJM,1355679,1357080,that's the new
cKpMvUmzhJM,1357080,1361360,2022 audi s3 this is a pretty desirable
cKpMvUmzhJM,1361360,1363760,sedan relatively sporty fun to drive
cKpMvUmzhJM,1363760,1366720,exciting nice looking good tech and it
cKpMvUmzhJM,1366720,1368559,solves a lot of the problems that i have
cKpMvUmzhJM,1368559,1371120,with the new volkswagen golf r anyway
cKpMvUmzhJM,1371120,1374240,now it's time to give the new s3 a doug
cKpMvUmzhJM,1374240,1376640,score
cKpMvUmzhJM,1378640,1381360,and the dug score is here 61 out of 100
cKpMvUmzhJM,1381360,1383039,which places the new s3 in a good spot
cKpMvUmzhJM,1383039,1384640,against its competition you'll note the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1384640,1387200,new s3 also ties the volkswagen golf r
cKpMvUmzhJM,1387200,1388480,but it's important to keep in mind the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1388480,1390080,golf r gets two extra points for
cKpMvUmzhJM,1390080,1392960,practicality so the s3 is better overall
cKpMvUmzhJM,1392960,1395039,unless you need that hatchback cargo
cKpMvUmzhJM,1395039,1397760,space if you do get the golf r otherwise
cKpMvUmzhJM,1397760,1400080,the s3 is a more compelling choice with
cKpMvUmzhJM,1400080,1402159,good power nice styling and a better
cKpMvUmzhJM,1402159,1404480,interior than many rivals including the
cKpMvUmzhJM,1404480,1407320,golf r
cKpMvUmzhJM,1407320,1411049,[Music]
