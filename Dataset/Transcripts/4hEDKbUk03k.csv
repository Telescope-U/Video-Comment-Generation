vid,start,end,text
4hEDKbUk03k,0,1680,i'm so excited to be here with you when
4hEDKbUk03k,1680,3199,i first started my youtube channel
4hEDKbUk03k,3199,4240,before that i saw the movie the
4hEDKbUk03k,4240,6960,internship in like 2013 and my dream job
4hEDKbUk03k,6960,8800,was to work at google so this feels like
4hEDKbUk03k,8800,10639,a really full circle moment thank you so
4hEDKbUk03k,10639,12240,much well you're close to where the
4hEDKbUk03k,12240,14719,google headquarters is yeah crazy yeah
4hEDKbUk03k,14719,17119,we did a tour yesterday and we saw like
4hEDKbUk03k,17119,19199,all these incredible venues and like the
4hEDKbUk03k,19199,21520,mini kitchens this collaborative culture
4hEDKbUk03k,21520,23359,which i think was a really big thing
4hEDKbUk03k,23359,25920,pre-covered how have you guys kind of
4hEDKbUk03k,25920,27760,looked at being like the pioneer of like
4hEDKbUk03k,27760,29679,this hybrid work model because i think
4hEDKbUk03k,29679,31199,before code you guys were like the
4hEDKbUk03k,31199,33840,pioneer like you're it um and now you're
4hEDKbUk03k,33840,35200,getting back a little bit but what do
4hEDKbUk03k,35200,36239,you think the future is going to look
4hEDKbUk03k,36239,38079,like with work that's such a good
4hEDKbUk03k,38079,40399,question uh you know there are people
4hEDKbUk03k,40399,42160,who like i got an email from someone
4hEDKbUk03k,42160,43760,yesterday saying they went for a run
4hEDKbUk03k,43760,45680,around the same loop they always run and
4hEDKbUk03k,45680,47680,it felt so good to be back
4hEDKbUk03k,47680,50000,and you know i think people people do
4hEDKbUk03k,50000,52399,need those connections and and
4hEDKbUk03k,52399,55360,but what we are embracing is flexibility
4hEDKbUk03k,55360,57039,uh i think people have gotten used to a
4hEDKbUk03k,57039,58800,more flexible life
4hEDKbUk03k,58800,60800,and i think init is uh you know as
4hEDKbUk03k,60800,62800,google one of the things we've always
4hEDKbUk03k,62800,64720,we've trusted our employees we've given
4hEDKbUk03k,64720,66479,them a lot of agency
4hEDKbUk03k,66479,68000,and so we want to give them the
4hEDKbUk03k,68000,70000,flexibility so that you're not too
4hEDKbUk03k,70000,71360,stressed if you have a doctor
4hEDKbUk03k,71360,72640,appointment or you have to show up at
4hEDKbUk03k,72640,73760,your kids
4hEDKbUk03k,73760,76240,parents conference or whatever it is
4hEDKbUk03k,76240,78320,but we expect people to come you know
4hEDKbUk03k,78320,80159,three days a week and but you know we'll
4hEDKbUk03k,80159,82799,be flexible overall and i think it's
4hEDKbUk03k,82799,84400,exciting so we can rethink our work
4hEDKbUk03k,84400,85759,spaces a bit
4hEDKbUk03k,85759,86880,make sure when people are coming
4hEDKbUk03k,86880,88400,together it is more meaningful you're
4hEDKbUk03k,88400,89920,actually coming to spend time and
4hEDKbUk03k,89920,91520,connect with people too so that's the
4hEDKbUk03k,91520,93200,opportunity are you in the office now
4hEDKbUk03k,93200,95439,like full time uh well not full time i
4hEDKbUk03k,95439,97439,also i'm taking advantage of the
4hEDKbUk03k,97439,100320,flexible thing which i announced so you
4hEDKbUk03k,100320,102159,know but i'm coming in about three days
4hEDKbUk03k,102159,104000,a week okay nice and so what do you
4hEDKbUk03k,104000,106079,think like what activities are good in
4hEDKbUk03k,106079,107920,person that you maybe can't replicate
4hEDKbUk03k,107920,111200,online oh i mean just going to the cafe
4hEDKbUk03k,111200,114079,yeah grabbing food and sitting outside
4hEDKbUk03k,114079,115520,and then suddenly somebody from some
4hEDKbUk03k,115520,117360,other team comes and joins and you know
4hEDKbUk03k,117360,118560,then talking to people about what
4hEDKbUk03k,118560,120240,they're working or even their life i
4hEDKbUk03k,120240,122479,think that serendipitous
4hEDKbUk03k,122479,124640,uh meandering stuff which you end up
4hEDKbUk03k,124640,125759,discovering
4hEDKbUk03k,125759,127200,i think it's so much tougher to do that
4hEDKbUk03k,127200,128800,over video for sure and also if you're
4hEDKbUk03k,128800,129759,rolling up your sleeves and
4hEDKbUk03k,129759,131520,brainstorming and working you know i
4hEDKbUk03k,131520,133040,think i think for sure i think there's
4hEDKbUk03k,133040,134560,like a huge intangible happiness
4hEDKbUk03k,134560,136319,increase by just being with people which
4hEDKbUk03k,136319,137920,we kind of experienced today at i o the
4hEDKbUk03k,137920,140319,first one back um what was that like for
4hEDKbUk03k,140319,141840,you like with the live audience being
4hEDKbUk03k,141840,143840,back in person yeah i mean i i got a bit
4hEDKbUk03k,143840,145360,surprised on stage the first time people
4hEDKbUk03k,145360,147360,i applaud it because then i you know
4hEDKbUk03k,147360,149200,because i i lost that sense for about
4hEDKbUk03k,149200,150800,two to three years and so you know it
4hEDKbUk03k,150800,152800,took me a while to kind of work my way
4hEDKbUk03k,152800,154480,through i felt like i'm readjusting back
4hEDKbUk03k,154480,156560,to the real world yeah it's nice the
4hEDKbUk03k,156560,158319,energy you feel and you know i think
4hEDKbUk03k,158319,160400,many people feel that too and you can
4hEDKbUk03k,160400,162879,see people are enjoying being back
4hEDKbUk03k,162879,165440,uh so hopefully we all can build on it
4hEDKbUk03k,165440,167440,and keep moving forward yeah and so you
4hEDKbUk03k,167440,168959,got guys announced you give an early
4hEDKbUk03k,168959,170480,look at the pixel 7 and then we have the
4hEDKbUk03k,170480,173120,6a the pixel watch i feel like we're
4hEDKbUk03k,173120,174560,really moving towards like this bigger
4hEDKbUk03k,174560,176800,ecosystem build how do you look at
4hEDKbUk03k,176800,178720,google's building the ecosystem i feel
4hEDKbUk03k,178720,180400,like you're in a really unique spot with
4hEDKbUk03k,180400,182720,being like an android like giving
4hEDKbUk03k,182720,184159,android to a lot of other oems and
4hEDKbUk03k,184159,185040,they're all building their own
4hEDKbUk03k,185040,186720,ecosystems how do you think google
4hEDKbUk03k,186720,189040,differentiates like the pixel ecosystem
4hEDKbUk03k,189040,190879,from like just android as a whole you
4hEDKbUk03k,190879,192560,know the power of android is people can
4hEDKbUk03k,192560,194080,take and take it in many different
4hEDKbUk03k,194080,195920,directions right and so it makes it
4hEDKbUk03k,195920,197280,flexible
4hEDKbUk03k,197280,199200,what i'm excited about google doing
4hEDKbUk03k,199200,202080,hardware is we get to express our view
4hEDKbUk03k,202080,203920,end-to-end view on how we want that
4hEDKbUk03k,203920,205680,experience to work
4hEDKbUk03k,205680,207280,and you know
4hEDKbUk03k,207280,209519,if you if you think about our vision of
4hEDKbUk03k,209519,211280,we want to make sure devices kind of are
4hEDKbUk03k,211280,213200,seamlessly working together there to
4hEDKbUk03k,213200,214560,help you
4hEDKbUk03k,214560,216159,not get in the way so that you're not
4hEDKbUk03k,216159,217599,dealing with things
4hEDKbUk03k,217599,220480,trying to fix things to do that well you
4hEDKbUk03k,220480,222560,need to have an end-to-end view and and
4hEDKbUk03k,222560,224159,that's what we are doing
4hEDKbUk03k,224159,226799,so for me this has been a long journey
4hEDKbUk03k,226799,228959,but to see a whole portfolio of products
4hEDKbUk03k,228959,230799,uh being able to put it together and
4hEDKbUk03k,230799,232480,make sure they're all working together a
4hEDKbUk03k,232480,234720,phone a watch a tablet
4hEDKbUk03k,234720,237920,and and underneath all that is ai and
4hEDKbUk03k,237920,240640,working uh across and the fact we are
4hEDKbUk03k,240640,242400,investing all the way down to our own
4hEDKbUk03k,242400,245120,silicon which now will work across all
4hEDKbUk03k,245120,247040,our products wow i think i think you
4hEDKbUk03k,247040,249120,know it's just a big big opportunity
4hEDKbUk03k,249120,250959,yeah so speaking of ai i think that's
4hEDKbUk03k,250959,252080,one of the things that you've really
4hEDKbUk03k,252080,253360,like brought to the forefront when you
4hEDKbUk03k,253360,254959,became ceo and one of the things i
4hEDKbUk03k,254959,256799,really admire about you is how you've
4hEDKbUk03k,256799,258400,done it in like a really ethical way and
4hEDKbUk03k,258400,259840,you kind of think about what the adverse
4hEDKbUk03k,259840,262320,effects could be of introducing ai
4hEDKbUk03k,262320,264000,there was so much ai today from like the
4hEDKbUk03k,264000,266160,google translate to the glasses that i
4hEDKbUk03k,266160,267199,think are gonna like change people's
4hEDKbUk03k,267199,269040,lives they come to fruition with the
4hEDKbUk03k,269040,271759,live translate um what ai projects to
4hEDKbUk03k,271759,273040,you do you feel like aren't covered
4hEDKbUk03k,273040,274400,enough but are like really exciting that
4hEDKbUk03k,274400,277520,you're um so to be working on
4hEDKbUk03k,277520,279120,at the core you know
4hEDKbUk03k,279120,281360,the essence of what you're seeing is
4hEDKbUk03k,281360,283520,making sure computers can
4hEDKbUk03k,283520,285440,like understand the world around the way
4hEDKbUk03k,285440,288880,humans do be able to see things look you
4hEDKbUk03k,288880,292080,know hear things and get context it's
4hEDKbUk03k,292080,293840,hard for computers to do so that's what
4hEDKbUk03k,293840,296560,a lot of the ai work we are we are doing
4hEDKbUk03k,296560,298639,is we spoke a little bit about language
4hEDKbUk03k,298639,301360,models today and and you know and they
4hEDKbUk03k,301360,303360,are getting more capable
4hEDKbUk03k,303360,305360,we have a lot of important areas to work
4hEDKbUk03k,305360,308240,through uh but the potential of that is
4hEDKbUk03k,308240,310720,what we try to show right the fact that
4hEDKbUk03k,310720,312560,you in your hands can have access to
4hEDKbUk03k,312560,313520,something
4hEDKbUk03k,313520,315360,which is knowledgeable on any topic or
4hEDKbUk03k,315360,317199,can imagine with you
4hEDKbUk03k,317199,319759,learn new things uh i i think i think
4hEDKbUk03k,319759,321360,that there is so
4hEDKbUk03k,321360,323919,so much potential on that so you know
4hEDKbUk03k,323919,325759,that's something i think it's not often
4hEDKbUk03k,325759,327360,talked about but it's an exciting part
4hEDKbUk03k,327360,328960,of what we're working on yeah i went to
4hEDKbUk03k,328960,330320,a press briefing with you guys a few
4hEDKbUk03k,330320,331919,weeks ago and it was talking a lot about
4hEDKbUk03k,331919,334080,like the flood detection and how many
4hEDKbUk03k,334080,335520,lives and like people that has really
4hEDKbUk03k,335520,337120,saved and i think when people think of
4hEDKbUk03k,337120,338560,google they think like search and
4hEDKbUk03k,338560,340160,android and docs and like all these
4hEDKbUk03k,340160,341919,things that really affect our lives but
4hEDKbUk03k,341919,343600,there are so many other things that you
4hEDKbUk03k,343600,345039,guys are working on even street view
4hEDKbUk03k,345039,347360,just had their 15-year anniversary that
4hEDKbUk03k,347360,349759,project has completely changed the world
4hEDKbUk03k,349759,352000,is there something with maps and street
4hEDKbUk03k,352000,353360,view that you're still expanding with
4hEDKbUk03k,353360,354800,because today in the briefing you talked
4hEDKbUk03k,354800,357360,a little bit about africa yeah well two
4hEDKbUk03k,357360,358720,things first of all we're bringing
4hEDKbUk03k,358720,360560,immersive view in maps
4hEDKbUk03k,360560,361919,so i think
4hEDKbUk03k,361919,364160,the real power of like
4hEDKbUk03k,364160,366880,thinking about a place seeing it as you
4hEDKbUk03k,366880,368960,would see it in real life including
4hEDKbUk03k,368960,371360,checking the inside of a hotel or a
4hEDKbUk03k,371360,373520,restaurant out anytime you want i think
4hEDKbUk03k,373520,376240,it's going to be very powerful and again
4hEDKbUk03k,376240,378000,that in the context of a different form
4hEDKbUk03k,378000,380000,factor in the future is the real
4hEDKbUk03k,380000,382080,potential of what we are uh what we are
4hEDKbUk03k,382080,384800,building what do you mean like in the ar
4hEDKbUk03k,384800,386880,glasses having that access to a
4hEDKbUk03k,386880,388160,immersive view
4hEDKbUk03k,388160,390000,uh so that if you're looking at a place
4hEDKbUk03k,390000,391600,you're looking at a restaurant if you
4hEDKbUk03k,391600,393840,want to you can say what the inside of
4hEDKbUk03k,393840,395759,it looks like or you know what the menu
4hEDKbUk03k,395759,397280,is
4hEDKbUk03k,397280,399280,and you know i think shows the power of
4hEDKbUk03k,399280,400319,power of
4hEDKbUk03k,400319,401440,all this
4hEDKbUk03k,401440,403039,but you know you brought up an important
4hEDKbUk03k,403039,404960,point which is access you want to make
4hEDKbUk03k,404960,406479,sure this all works everywhere in the
4hEDKbUk03k,406479,408800,world which is why we're mapping
4hEDKbUk03k,408800,411280,buildings in africa using ai to map it
4hEDKbUk03k,411280,412639,better yeah
4hEDKbUk03k,412639,415280,creating a data set opening up that data
4hEDKbUk03k,415280,417440,center including organizations like
4hEDKbUk03k,417440,419360,world bank and united nations so they
4hEDKbUk03k,419360,420240,can do
4hEDKbUk03k,420240,421840,important work with it so all that is
4hEDKbUk03k,421840,423840,part of the work we are doing how do you
4hEDKbUk03k,423840,426240,approach like what ai you like really
4hEDKbUk03k,426240,427840,work on and what doesn't maybe come to
4hEDKbUk03k,427840,429120,fruition because i'm sure people pitch
4hEDKbUk03k,429120,430720,you like a lot of different projects
4hEDKbUk03k,430720,432639,like magic eraser i think is one that
4hEDKbUk03k,432639,434319,like makes complete sense and it's
4hEDKbUk03k,434319,436080,worked really well and then yesterday on
4hEDKbUk03k,436080,438240,our tour there was um google lens where
4hEDKbUk03k,438240,439840,we saw a robot in one of the spots were
4hEDKbUk03k,439840,441440,like what is this and it immediately
4hEDKbUk03k,441440,443280,came up how do you kind of figure out
4hEDKbUk03k,443280,444639,what projects are the most meaningful
4hEDKbUk03k,444639,446000,with the ai
4hEDKbUk03k,446000,450080,i mean we have i mean the test i use is
4hEDKbUk03k,450080,452479,is this if by creating a feature with
4hEDKbUk03k,452479,453360,this
4hEDKbUk03k,453360,455199,is it going to be helpful i think about
4hEDKbUk03k,455199,456800,it four dimensions is going to help
4hEDKbUk03k,456800,459680,people improve their knowledge
4hEDKbUk03k,459680,462319,success health or happiness okay if it
4hEDKbUk03k,462319,464400,fits one of those four attributes
4hEDKbUk03k,464400,466160,i think it's good to do so that's that's
4hEDKbUk03k,466160,468400,kind of how i think about it and if i
4hEDKbUk03k,468400,470400,feel it's not doing any of that you know
4hEDKbUk03k,470400,471919,i would question as to why we are adding
4hEDKbUk03k,471919,473919,that yeah but that's the bar with which
4hEDKbUk03k,473919,475680,we think about everything we do and i
4hEDKbUk03k,475680,477520,think globally too you've talked in the
4hEDKbUk03k,477520,479199,past about like your moonshot goal of
4hEDKbUk03k,479199,482639,being carbon free by 2030. how do you
4hEDKbUk03k,482639,484879,approach like climate change and all the
4hEDKbUk03k,484879,486000,other things that's like a giant
4hEDKbUk03k,486000,487599,corporation because and i watched an
4hEDKbUk03k,487599,488960,interview that you did with stanford and
4hEDKbUk03k,488960,490720,you were talking about how a lot of the
4hEDKbUk03k,490720,492160,times like you'll approach a project if
4hEDKbUk03k,492160,493680,you think that google could be the right
4hEDKbUk03k,493680,495919,fit and kind of advance it how do you
4hEDKbUk03k,495919,498560,look at like being carbon frame oh
4hEDKbUk03k,498560,500560,you know it's it's the most important
4hEDKbUk03k,500560,502879,thing uh you know i think we could be
4hEDKbUk03k,502879,504080,working on
4hEDKbUk03k,504080,505840,i think your generation is going to hold
4hEDKbUk03k,505840,507360,all of us accountable
4hEDKbUk03k,507360,509680,yeah if you don't make progress there
4hEDKbUk03k,509680,512159,and and you know as a company we bet on
4hEDKbUk03k,512159,514800,wind and solar early and over 10 years
4hEDKbUk03k,514800,516719,it's become more mainstream to really
4hEDKbUk03k,516719,519120,run 24 7 carbon free everywhere in the
4hEDKbUk03k,519120,521360,world yeah we have to solve this
4hEDKbUk03k,521360,523760,everywhere look at new sources of energy
4hEDKbUk03k,523760,525120,we now have a data center with
4hEDKbUk03k,525120,526480,geothermal
4hEDKbUk03k,526480,527920,we are looking at technologies like
4hEDKbUk03k,527920,529360,carbon capture
4hEDKbUk03k,529360,531920,and and so remember we cannot do it with
4hEDKbUk03k,531920,535040,offsets this is to say 24 7 every search
4hEDKbUk03k,535040,537360,you do every youtube video every gmail
4hEDKbUk03k,537360,540080,yeah you know works carbon free and and
4hEDKbUk03k,540080,542240,and so that's a big goal yeah but as a
4hEDKbUk03k,542240,544240,technologist i'm excited because that
4hEDKbUk03k,544240,546080,allows us to invest develop new
4hEDKbUk03k,546080,548160,technologies which can then make its way
4hEDKbUk03k,548160,549519,into the world
4hEDKbUk03k,549519,551600,and sustainability is something in which
