_2jULayKYTs,4480,6640,of minecraft a haunting floating
_2jULayKYTs,6640,8800,nightmare that's eluded all explanations
_2jULayKYTs,8800,11360,since its introduction back in 2017 the
_2jULayKYTs,11360,13840,ancient builders a civilization lost to
_2jULayKYTs,13840,16160,history their works brought to ruin and
_2jULayKYTs,16160,19039,their name eroded by time the warden the
_2jULayKYTs,19039,21359,newest threat to this world a creature
_2jULayKYTs,21359,24160,of blind rage engulfed in shadow an
_2jULayKYTs,24160,26800,unstoppable force fueled by souls and
_2jULayKYTs,26800,29760,empowered by darkness three groups three
_2jULayKYTs,29760,32238,distinct mysteries waiting to be solved
_2jULayKYTs,32238,36559,and all of them united by this
_2jULayKYTs,38160,41200,hello internet welcome to game theory

_2jULayKYTs,51680,52800,is it safe
_2jULayKYTs,52800,54800,are we okay so sorry about that i kind
_2jULayKYTs,54800,56640,of forgot the warden was a thing but can
_2jULayKYTs,56640,58320,you blame me the warden was due to come
_2jULayKYTs,58320,60559,out in the summer of 2021 but then the
_2jULayKYTs,60559,62399,deep dark ended up getting removed from
_2jULayKYTs,62399,64478,the update which itself got split into
_2jULayKYTs,64478,66479,two parts speaking of two parts no don't
_2jULayKYTs,66479,68240,worry this episode isn't a two-parter
_2jULayKYTs,68240,69840,but we do have ourselves a second
_2jULayKYTs,69840,72320,minecraft video happening today over on
_2jULayKYTs,72320,73760,food theory that's right we got
_2jULayKYTs,73760,76000,ourselves a minecraft weekend y'all well
_2jULayKYTs,76000,77520,here we're busy dissecting the latest
_2jULayKYTs,77520,79360,editions from the wild update over on
_2jULayKYTs,79360,81200,food theory we're talking all about the
_2jULayKYTs,81200,83520,dream smp which honestly doesn't sound
_2jULayKYTs,83520,85360,very foodie but then dream decided to go
_2jULayKYTs,85360,87600,and kill tommy in it using a potato and
_2jULayKYTs,87600,89439,you know where there is murder to be had
_2jULayKYTs,89439,90640,we'll probably find a way to make a
_2jULayKYTs,90640,92240,theory out of it so head on over there
_2jULayKYTs,92240,94240,for all your potato murder needs after
_2jULayKYTs,94240,95600,you're done with this video because
_2jULayKYTs,95600,97040,first we gotta finish talking about the
_2jULayKYTs,97040,99439,warden as of this week it has finally
_2jULayKYTs,99439,101520,launched as part of the wild update
_2jULayKYTs,101520,103119,according to mojang not only have the
_2jULayKYTs,103119,104799,mechanics of the warden been refined but
_2jULayKYTs,104799,106640,they've added new blocks to the deep
_2jULayKYTs,106640,109119,dark new items and oh yeah we're also
_2jULayKYTs,109119,111119,getting one of the coolest most complex
_2jULayKYTs,111119,113360,and interesting structures ever created
_2jULayKYTs,113360,116079,in minecraft the ancient cities based on
_2jULayKYTs,116079,117439,the name alone this seems like the thing
_2jULayKYTs,117439,119360,that we've been theorizing about for
_2jULayKYTs,119360,122799,years oh victory has never felt so good
_2jULayKYTs,122799,124399,but you know what feels even better than
_2jULayKYTs,124399,128000,being right have a new lore to chew on
_2jULayKYTs,128000,129599,mojang understands that you don't just
_2jULayKYTs,129599,131680,drop an entire underground city complete
_2jULayKYTs,131680,133840,with giant burning portal frame into
_2jULayKYTs,133840,135440,your game without considering what it's
_2jULayKYTs,135440,137360,doing there from a story perspective and
_2jULayKYTs,137360,139200,similarly you don't just introduce the
_2jULayKYTs,139200,141440,single strongest mob to guard it without
_2jULayKYTs,141440,143280,factoring in the rationale for placing
_2jULayKYTs,143280,145760,it there so our question is why what
_2jULayKYTs,145760,147760,does all of this mean for the secret
_2jULayKYTs,147760,149680,story of minecraft how do these
_2jULayKYTs,149680,152000,disparate parts wind up working together
_2jULayKYTs,152000,154160,well shockingly not only is everything
_2jULayKYTs,154160,155680,here connected but all of it is also
_2jULayKYTs,155680,157200,tied to one of the longest standing
_2jULayKYTs,157200,159280,mysteries in the game the wither but to
_2jULayKYTs,159280,161519,decode it all we actually need one key
_2jULayKYTs,161519,163519,item an item that's been broken up and
_2jULayKYTs,163519,165280,hidden throughout all of these updates
_2jULayKYTs,165280,167120,something innocuous something
_2jULayKYTs,167120,169680,unsuspecting a simple music disc
_2jULayKYTs,169680,171920,everything is unlocked through this one
_2jULayKYTs,171920,174080,disc so what is the story of the deep
_2jULayKYTs,174080,175360,dark and how does it tie into the
_2jULayKYTs,175360,176800,narrative that we've been building over
_2jULayKYTs,176800,179040,the last three years strap in friends
_2jULayKYTs,179040,181280,cause today we're diving in deep to tap
_2jULayKYTs,181280,184159,into the darkest lore of minecraft first
_2jULayKYTs,184159,185519,let's talk about the skulk when the
_2jULayKYTs,185519,186959,skulk family of blocks was originally
_2jULayKYTs,186959,188800,announced in 2020 we understood the
_2jULayKYTs,188800,190879,basics a skull sensor reacts to noise
_2jULayKYTs,190879,192560,and when it does it alerts a fearsome
_2jULayKYTs,192560,194239,monster known as the warden to your
_2jULayKYTs,194239,196239,exact location two hits later you're
_2jULayKYTs,196239,198319,dead son but now we have more details
_2jULayKYTs,198319,200720,and what we've learned is disturbing to
_2jULayKYTs,200720,202560,say the least a new block called the
_2jULayKYTs,202560,204879,skulk catalyst basically takes in energy
_2jULayKYTs,204879,206720,to transform the blocks around it into
_2jULayKYTs,206720,208480,other skulk blocks that's how this
_2jULayKYTs,208480,210159,creature is able to spread but it begs
_2jULayKYTs,210159,212159,the question what energy is it using to
_2jULayKYTs,212159,214560,convert these regular blocks well this
_2jULayKYTs,214560,216159,ain't your grandma's moss blocks that
_2jULayKYTs,216159,217840,you can just bone meal around my friends
_2jULayKYTs,217840,219360,these things take something a bit more
_2jULayKYTs,219360,221760,potent than that the souls of the living
_2jULayKYTs,221760,223440,you see if a mob dies within eight
_2jULayKYTs,223440,225040,blocks of the catalyst the mob won't
_2jULayKYTs,225040,227840,drop xp orbs instead souls appear above
_2jULayKYTs,227840,229680,the catalyst at which point the skulk
_2jULayKYTs,229680,231519,spreads to new blocks remind me where
_2jULayKYTs,231519,233200,have we seen souls in relation to this
_2jULayKYTs,233200,235200,update before oh yeah the warden in the
_2jULayKYTs,235200,236720,middle of its chest we have what looked
_2jULayKYTs,236720,238959,to be the faces of three trapped souls
_2jULayKYTs,238959,240560,now in our last theory we speculated
_2jULayKYTs,240560,241920,that wardens were created using a
_2jULayKYTs,241920,243840,combination of skulk and souls in order
_2jULayKYTs,243840,245120,to protect the underground cities
_2jULayKYTs,245120,247360,however i'm not so sure anymore back in
_2jULayKYTs,247360,249760,2020 we got this tweet from 1.19
_2jULayKYTs,249760,251439,developer brandon pierce which says
_2jULayKYTs,251439,253120,quote you could definitely argue that
_2jULayKYTs,253120,255360,the skulk in general is sentient now we
_2jULayKYTs,255360,257040,just talk about how when a mob dies near
_2jULayKYTs,257040,259120,the skull catalyst it creates new skulk
_2jULayKYTs,259120,260880,blocks but it can also create a new
_2jULayKYTs,260880,263040,block called the skulk shrieker this
_2jULayKYTs,263040,265120,block is the key because not only does
_2jULayKYTs,265120,267040,it have souls swirling around inside of
_2jULayKYTs,267040,268400,it thereby confirming that it's being
_2jULayKYTs,268400,270080,created from the souls of the dead but
_2jULayKYTs,270080,273918,it also makes these sounds
_2jULayKYTs,274800,276160,that's fine i didn't need to sleep
_2jULayKYTs,276160,277840,tonight minecraft is totally a kids game
_2jULayKYTs,277840,279440,anyway that shriek isn't just signaling
_2jULayKYTs,279440,280800,that i have to take an adult diaper
_2jULayKYTs,280800,282400,change when it goes off you'll hear
_2jULayKYTs,282400,284000,another noise the sound of something
_2jULayKYTs,284000,285759,burrowing up to the surface that
_2jULayKYTs,285759,288080,something is the warden so what am i
_2jULayKYTs,288080,289840,saying here well i'm suggesting that the
_2jULayKYTs,289840,291120,warden wasn't created by the ancient
_2jULayKYTs,291120,292960,builders to protect themselves instead i
_2jULayKYTs,292960,294560,think it was made by the skulk to
_2jULayKYTs,294560,297120,protect itself when it senses danger it
_2jULayKYTs,297120,299040,summons a creature made of skull an
_2jULayKYTs,299040,301039,unstoppable force that acts as the final
_2jULayKYTs,301039,302800,line of defense trying to ensure the
_2jULayKYTs,302800,305039,survival of this species and this is
_2jULayKYTs,305039,306479,actually supported by the warden item
_2jULayKYTs,306479,308160,drops you see if you manage to take one
_2jULayKYTs,308160,310639,down it drops a single skulk catalyst
_2jULayKYTs,310639,312000,which honestly feels like a crummy
_2jULayKYTs,312000,313520,reward for something so difficult
_2jULayKYTs,313520,315680,however from a lore standpoint it makes
_2jULayKYTs,315680,317520,perfect sense if the wharton's primary
_2jULayKYTs,317520,319360,objective is indeed the survival of the
_2jULayKYTs,319360,321199,species then in defeat it would want to
_2jULayKYTs,321199,322800,release a last-ditch attempt to keep the
_2jULayKYTs,322800,325680,species alive hence a single catalyst
_2jULayKYTs,325680,327440,but that still doesn't answer the major
_2jULayKYTs,327440,329199,question where did the skulk come from
_2jULayKYTs,329199,330720,in the first place for that we actually
_2jULayKYTs,330720,332240,have to take a closer look at the new
_2jULayKYTs,332240,334720,biome the deep dark and more importantly
_2jULayKYTs,334720,336479,those ancient cities once you enter the
_2jULayKYTs,336479,337840,deep dark biome you start to find these
_2jULayKYTs,337840,339520,patches of skulk blocks if you follow
_2jULayKYTs,339520,341280,these patches further down into the cave
_2jULayKYTs,341280,343360,eventually you'll find an ancient city
_2jULayKYTs,343360,345759,ruins covered in even more skull logic
_2jULayKYTs,345759,346800,would dictate that since the
_2jULayKYTs,346800,348400,concentration of skulk is higher in the
_2jULayKYTs,348400,350479,cities this must be where it originated
_2jULayKYTs,350479,352400,and this seems to be correct in ancient
_2jULayKYTs,352400,354160,cities the hallways are covered in wool
_2jULayKYTs,354160,356080,and carpets that's an important detail
_2jULayKYTs,356080,358080,since the skulk and wardens are sound
_2jULayKYTs,358080,359840,based entities they respond to your
_2jULayKYTs,359840,361440,steps and wouldn't you know wool and
_2jULayKYTs,361440,363039,carpet are the only blocks that don't
_2jULayKYTs,363039,364639,activate the skulk when they're walked
_2jULayKYTs,364639,366479,on this tells us that the inhabitants of
_2jULayKYTs,366479,368240,the ancient city were clearly aware of
_2jULayKYTs,368240,369840,the warden and they were trying to live
_2jULayKYTs,369840,371600,their best alongside it however just
_2jULayKYTs,371600,372639,because this seems to be where the
_2jULayKYTs,372639,374400,warden lives now doesn't mean that it's
_2jULayKYTs,374400,376400,always been here right in the middle of
_2jULayKYTs,376400,377680,the ancient cities is a massive
_2jULayKYTs,377680,379440,structure made out of a new block called
_2jULayKYTs,379440,381680,reinforced deep slate and a movable
_2jULayKYTs,381680,383600,indestructible block similar to the end
_2jULayKYTs,383600,385199,portal frames but that's not where the
_2jULayKYTs,385199,387120,similarities end in the game files this
_2jULayKYTs,387120,389199,big structure of reinforced deep slate
_2jULayKYTs,389199,390880,is known as the city center it's a
_2jULayKYTs,390880,392479,pretty generic name right doesn't really
_2jULayKYTs,392479,394400,tell us all that much however there are
_2jULayKYTs,394400,396160,smaller versions of that same city
_2jULayKYTs,396160,398000,center dotted around and in the game
_2jULayKYTs,398000,400319,files they're known as small portal
_2jULayKYTs,400319,402800,statues portal you say now sure mojang
_2jULayKYTs,402800,404319,has said for years that it isn't adding
_2jULayKYTs,404319,405840,any new dimensions but that's missing
_2jULayKYTs,405840,407280,the point i don't think mojang is
_2jULayKYTs,407280,408720,introducing a new dimension i think
_2jULayKYTs,408720,410560,they're introducing the idea of a new
_2jULayKYTs,410560,412400,dimension as they continue to explain
_2jULayKYTs,412400,414319,minecraft's history a history that
_2jULayKYTs,414319,416479,becomes a lot more clear thanks to one
_2jULayKYTs,416479,418560,little item or should i say nine little
_2jULayKYTs,418560,420479,items that make up a bigger one disc
_2jULayKYTs,420479,422400,number five that's right ladies and
_2jULayKYTs,422400,424080,gentlemen we've got ourselves a new
_2jULayKYTs,424080,425759,numbered disc and you know what that
_2jULayKYTs,425759,428400,means sound-based storytelling but
_2jULayKYTs,428400,429840,before i can start piecing together the
_2jULayKYTs,429840,432000,disc and the lore i've got to tell you
_2jULayKYTs,432000,433520,about how you can start piecing together
_2jULayKYTs,433520,435280,a great website because this portion of
_2jULayKYTs,435280,436960,today's episode is sponsored by

_2jULayKYTs,447120,449440,cat skips beauty picks why because while
_2jULayKYTs,449440,450960,i could have done something predictable
_2jULayKYTs,450960,452560,like show you one of the multiple
_2jULayKYTs,452560,453919,professional sites that we've made in
_2jULayKYTs,453919,455840,the past using squarespace i instead
_2jULayKYTs,455840,457680,wanted an excuse to show you some top
_2jULayKYTs,457680,459680,tier skip content and making websites
_2jULayKYTs,459680,461360,with squarespace is so fast and easy i
_2jULayKYTs,461360,463440,was like why not so true story i've
_2jULayKYTs,463440,464800,tried to make websites in the past and i
_2jULayKYTs,464800,466319,could barely get one picture on the
_2jULayKYTs,466319,467840,front page and when i did it was
_2jULayKYTs,467840,470080,pixelated and weirdly sized and stayed
_2jULayKYTs,470080,471919,oddly skewed to the right it was a hot
_2jULayKYTs,471919,474240,mess my c plus was more like d minus
_2jULayKYTs,474240,476160,minus but with squarespace's editable

_2jULayKYTs,477440,479360,looks professional and amazing in
_2jULayKYTs,479360,481759,minutes no joke you have to actively try
_2jULayKYTs,481759,483440,to make them look bad i mean look i'm
_2jULayKYTs,483440,485280,practically designing skip's new site in
_2jULayKYTs,485280,487280,real time using their template as i talk
_2jULayKYTs,487280,489280,to you look at him how can you resist

_2jULayKYTs,537360,539360,thank you for supporting skip's modeling
_2jULayKYTs,539360,541760,career and now back to our episode as i
_2jULayKYTs,541760,543360,alluded to disc five is actually split
_2jULayKYTs,543360,544959,into nine fragments which can be found
_2jULayKYTs,544959,546480,in chests throughout the ancient city
_2jULayKYTs,546480,548240,but instead of delightful music this one
_2jULayKYTs,548240,550160,follows in the footsteps of discs 11 and
_2jULayKYTs,550160,552160,13 a sound effect driven track that's
_2jULayKYTs,552160,553839,designed to tell us a story in order to
_2jULayKYTs,553839,555680,fill out the lore of what's going on
_2jULayKYTs,555680,557040,here the track starts off with the
_2jULayKYTs,557040,558640,classic sound of static like you'd
_2jULayKYTs,558640,560160,expect from an old record player but it
_2jULayKYTs,560160,562240,begins to ramp up into a loud rumble
_2jULayKYTs,562240,563680,which is then immediately cut off
_2jULayKYTs,563680,565360,followed by what appears to be the speed
_2jULayKYTs,565360,568079,up of time
_2jULayKYTs,569519,570880,we'll hear these sorts of speed ramp
_2jULayKYTs,570880,572480,effects a lot throughout the disc the
_2jULayKYTs,572480,573600,next set of sounds are ones that are
_2jULayKYTs,573600,575279,familiar to anyone who knows discs 11
_2jULayKYTs,575279,577120,and 13 the sound of someone walking
_2jULayKYTs,577120,579760,underground this time on drip stone you
_2jULayKYTs,579760,581200,can tell based on the footsteps using
_2jULayKYTs,581200,582640,their flint and steel to light a fire
_2jULayKYTs,582640,584320,while bats flutter through the cave
_2jULayKYTs,584320,588560,[Music]
_2jULayKYTs,588560,590480,however as this character walks it
_2jULayKYTs,590480,592399,eventually turns into a march which is
_2jULayKYTs,592399,594240,then joined by other footsteps coming
_2jULayKYTs,594240,596240,from what seems like heavily armored
_2jULayKYTs,596240,598320,soldiers we can make out sirens going
_2jULayKYTs,598320,601640,off in the background
_2jULayKYTs,604640,606160,it all comes to an abrupt halt when
_2jULayKYTs,606160,607600,something that sounds like a lever gets
_2jULayKYTs,607600,609040,pulled now i look through a lot of
_2jULayKYTs,609040,610720,minecraft sounds but there are a number
_2jULayKYTs,610720,612000,of sounds in this track that i couldn't
_2jULayKYTs,612000,613680,find exact matches for sounds like
_2jULayKYTs,613680,614959,they've added extra sound effects to
_2jULayKYTs,614959,616560,help build out the story like in this
_2jULayKYTs,616560,618000,case the sound of a lever is more like a
_2jULayKYTs,618000,619680,switch being flicked but in the track it
_2jULayKYTs,619680,621440,feels much bigger like a lever that's
_2jULayKYTs,621440,623279,attached to a large mechanism cause
_2jULayKYTs,623279,624800,following that sound we hear some
_2jULayKYTs,624800,626640,creaking and the sound of wind rushing
_2jULayKYTs,626640,631480,in like a huge door that's being opened
_2jULayKYTs,632000,633440,after this we hear our character take a
_2jULayKYTs,633440,635279,deep breath only to then hear a monster
_2jULayKYTs,635279,637680,shriek
_2jULayKYTs,639600,640959,so far it feels relatively
_2jULayKYTs,640959,642560,self-explanatory the first person we
_2jULayKYTs,642560,644399,hear walking is someone leading a charge
_2jULayKYTs,644399,646160,or a group of soldiers lighting a torch
_2jULayKYTs,646160,647600,to help them walk underground in the
_2jULayKYTs,647600,649440,distance we hear the warning sirens of a
_2jULayKYTs,649440,651360,city blaring they open the door in order
_2jULayKYTs,651360,652800,to defend the city against something
_2jULayKYTs,652800,655360,when suddenly the disc has a weird break
_2jULayKYTs,655360,657920,we hear 23 seconds of just music it's
_2jULayKYTs,657920,659440,almost like different discs have been
_2jULayKYTs,659440,661440,smashed together it wasn't fragments
_2jULayKYTs,661440,662560,after all that would also probably
_2jULayKYTs,662560,663920,explain all the time warping effects we
_2jULayKYTs,663920,665120,hear throughout the track different
_2jULayKYTs,665120,666720,chunks of the disc were recorded at
_2jULayKYTs,666720,668640,different rpms which is why the audio is
_2jULayKYTs,668640,670560,constantly warping and shifting anyway
_2jULayKYTs,670560,672079,when the music ends we're back to the
_2jULayKYTs,672079,674000,story bubbling lava can be heard while
_2jULayKYTs,674000,675680,more footsteps on drip stone move
_2jULayKYTs,675680,677440,towards an amethyst they break the block
_2jULayKYTs,677440,679040,and doing so seems to set off some sort
_2jULayKYTs,679040,681600,of a cave-in
_2jULayKYTs,683760,685519,it's not really a sound i recognize and
_2jULayKYTs,685519,687120,the closest i could find were mood
_2jULayKYTs,687120,688959,sounds from the nether wastelands which
_2jULayKYTs,688959,690480,would explain the lava but not really
_2jULayKYTs,690480,692160,the drip stone floor of the amethyst
_2jULayKYTs,692160,693920,after the cave-in we hear screeches off
_2jULayKYTs,693920,696000,in the distance screeches of what appear
_2jULayKYTs,696000,698880,to be phantoms
_2jULayKYTs,699279,700480,doesn't make a whole lot of sense
_2jULayKYTs,700480,702000,underground however very shortly
_2jULayKYTs,702000,703680,afterwards we hear our character run
_2jULayKYTs,703680,705200,quickly and the terrain changes from
_2jULayKYTs,705200,708959,drip stone to stone to dirt
_2jULayKYTs,709110,711760,[Music]
_2jULayKYTs,711760,713360,meaning that he's running relatively
_2jULayKYTs,713360,714880,close to the surface we are the clanging
_2jULayKYTs,714880,716320,of tools as they collect materials
_2jULayKYTs,716320,720000,coughing as they light fires to sea
_2jULayKYTs,721760,723279,but he clearly sees something that
_2jULayKYTs,723279,725120,causes him to run away quickly only to
_2jULayKYTs,725120,726720,then reveal another monster roar which
_2jULayKYTs,726720,728399,is again quickly distorted by the change
_2jULayKYTs,728399,730240,of scene from the disc thuds are now
_2jULayKYTs,730240,732000,heard in the background explosions
_2jULayKYTs,732000,735200,distorted by the cave system
_2jULayKYTs,735200,737279,our character places down sand scrapes a
_2jULayKYTs,737279,738959,metal tool against a stony object and
_2jULayKYTs,738959,740880,finally a mechanical noise is heard all
_2jULayKYTs,740880,742399,while eerie voices whisper in the
_2jULayKYTs,742399,744000,background similar to that of the soul
_2jULayKYTs,744000,745760,sand valleys but the explosions are
_2jULayKYTs,745760,747519,getting more frequent until eventually
_2jULayKYTs,747519,750959,one bursts into the area
_2jULayKYTs,754399,756079,there's a brief moment of silence before
_2jULayKYTs,756079,757760,suddenly the reverse sound of glass is
_2jULayKYTs,757760,759680,heard and we hear the souls shriek in a
_2jULayKYTs,759680,761920,huge gust leaving nothing but a warping
_2jULayKYTs,761920,763680,hum in the background all of which
_2jULayKYTs,763680,765839,sounds very similar to the creation of a
_2jULayKYTs,765839,768839,portal
_2jULayKYTs,773360,774800,in that moment our character takes a few
_2jULayKYTs,774800,776320,steps towards the portal we know this
_2jULayKYTs,776320,778079,because the sound gets louder until he
_2jULayKYTs,778079,779680,places down dirt blocks to help him
_2jULayKYTs,779680,781600,reach it where we are then met with the
_2jULayKYTs,781600,784240,sound of a skulk sensor and the roar of
_2jULayKYTs,784240,787320,a warden
_2jULayKYTs,789920,791279,tape actually winds down here but
_2jULayKYTs,791279,792800,there's actually one more sound mixed in
_2jULayKYTs,792800,796920,with the warden roar listen carefully
_2jULayKYTs,800560,802480,did you catch it the warden roars and
_2jULayKYTs,802480,804639,it's closely followed by a slowed down
_2jULayKYTs,804639,807040,death sound from one very specific mob
_2jULayKYTs,807040,809600,the wither
_2jULayKYTs,811200,812959,so that's the breakdown of the disc from
_2jULayKYTs,812959,814560,what i can hear but thinking about the
_2jULayKYTs,814560,815839,story fragments that we have the
_2jULayKYTs,815839,817839,question is what does it mean well let's
_2jULayKYTs,817839,819199,actually talk about that last bit a
_2jULayKYTs,819199,821279,member of an ancient builder society the
_2jULayKYTs,821279,822639,same one that made these underground
_2jULayKYTs,822639,824880,cities is out caving collecting precious
_2jULayKYTs,824880,826480,materials when all of a sudden he hears
_2jULayKYTs,826480,828560,something out in the distance he rushes
_2jULayKYTs,828560,831040,to the surface only to see the wither
_2jULayKYTs,831040,832880,floating there this leads to the first
_2jULayKYTs,832880,834480,section of the disc with the emergency
_2jULayKYTs,834480,836880,sirens blaring the wither is on its way
_2jULayKYTs,836880,838639,so the city needs to mobilize its army
_2jULayKYTs,838639,840320,to try and take it down they travel
_2jULayKYTs,840320,841600,through the caves until they get to a
_2jULayKYTs,841600,843440,secure entrance when they open the gates
_2jULayKYTs,843440,845279,it's clear that their worst fears have
_2jULayKYTs,845279,847279,come true the wither has followed the
_2jULayKYTs,847279,849600,colonists down into the depths they can
_2jULayKYTs,849600,851120,hear the withers explosions in the
_2jULayKYTs,851120,852639,distance getting closer and more
_2jULayKYTs,852639,854480,frequent desperate for an escape they
_2jULayKYTs,854480,855920,rushed to finish the new portal
_2jULayKYTs,855920,857279,technology they've been working on
_2jULayKYTs,857279,859279,they've clearly built portals before
_2jULayKYTs,859279,860720,specifically to the nether where they've
_2jULayKYTs,860720,862160,learned about the properties of soul
_2jULayKYTs,862160,863760,sand we know this because of the
_2jULayKYTs,863760,865760,lanterns that are all around the ancient
_2jULayKYTs,865760,866880,city they begin to make the final
_2jULayKYTs,866880,868399,touches to their portal they make it out
_2jULayKYTs,868399,870480,of a block that is so impenetrable not
_2jULayKYTs,870480,872639,even the wither can destroy it this is
_2jULayKYTs,872639,874160,gonna be their ticket out they place
_2jULayKYTs,874160,876079,soul sand underneath this new portal and
_2jULayKYTs,876079,877600,they light it which is exactly what we
_2jULayKYTs,877600,879279,see left over in the ancient cities
_2jULayKYTs,879279,880720,there are also still remnants of their
_2jULayKYTs,880720,882240,experiments underneath the portal
_2jULayKYTs,882240,883839,redstone circuits experimenting with
_2jULayKYTs,883839,885519,powering blocks how much power you can
_2jULayKYTs,885519,886639,output with different objects
_2jULayKYTs,886639,888560,redirecting power ultimately soul sand
_2jULayKYTs,888560,890160,seems to be the most powerful source of
_2jULayKYTs,890160,891920,energy combining all of these things
_2jULayKYTs,891920,893839,together allows them to open the portal
_2jULayKYTs,893839,895760,the souls from the soul sand screaming
_2jULayKYTs,895760,897279,as they're used to power it at that
_2jULayKYTs,897279,899040,moment the wither breaks through the
_2jULayKYTs,899040,900560,builder makes his way to the portal to
_2jULayKYTs,900560,902240,escape but it's not what they expect
_2jULayKYTs,902240,904320,from the portal comes the warden who
_2jULayKYTs,904320,906560,destroys the wither but also brings the
_2jULayKYTs,906560,909279,skulk into this world and so that is the
_2jULayKYTs,909279,911440,story of disc 5 the origins of the
_2jULayKYTs,911440,913279,warden it's not an experiment gone wrong
_2jULayKYTs,913279,915120,it's a desperate escape attempt to the
_2jULayKYTs,915120,917600,wrong place which brings with it a new
_2jULayKYTs,917600,920079,and deadly invasive species the skulk
_2jULayKYTs,920079,921600,but the thing is disc five isn't the end
_2jULayKYTs,921600,923279,of our story because how did the ancient
_2jULayKYTs,923279,925199,builders go from here all the way to the
_2jULayKYTs,925199,926880,end well it may be slightly more
_2jULayKYTs,926880,928720,speculative but hear me out the warden
_2jULayKYTs,928720,929920,comes through the portal and kills the
_2jULayKYTs,929920,931440,wither this wasn't the ancient builder's
_2jULayKYTs,931440,932959,intent but hate worked out for him
_2jULayKYTs,932959,934639,regardless and so they worship the
_2jULayKYTs,934639,936880,warden as some kind of god this is why
_2jULayKYTs,936880,938639,there are candles all around the portal
_2jULayKYTs,938639,940240,along with the portal being shaped to
_2jULayKYTs,940240,942079,look like the warden however this
_2jULayKYTs,942079,944160,blissful ignorance doesn't last forever
_2jULayKYTs,944160,945839,the ancient builders carry on with their
_2jULayKYTs,945839,948000,lives but doing so activates the new
_2jULayKYTs,948000,949839,skulk that's around which eventually
_2jULayKYTs,949839,951839,re-summons the warden the warden then
_2jULayKYTs,951839,953600,goes on to kill many ancient builders
_2jULayKYTs,953600,955519,spreading the skull further those that
_2jULayKYTs,955519,957360,do manage to survive try what they can
_2jULayKYTs,957360,958800,to remain in the city that they've built
_2jULayKYTs,958800,960639,they put down carpets and wool to make
_2jULayKYTs,960639,961920,sure that they don't make sounds while
_2jULayKYTs,961920,964079,walking around but it's not enough even
_2jULayKYTs,964079,966639,opening their chests sets the skulk off
_2jULayKYTs,966639,968079,so they're forced to leave the city the
_2jULayKYTs,968079,969600,few that remain decide rather than
_2jULayKYTs,969600,971440,building vast cities to instead build
_2jULayKYTs,971440,973839,one fortified fortress the stronghold
_2jULayKYTs,973839,975519,built with confusing hallways and
_2jULayKYTs,975519,977279,winding staircases in order to give them
_2jULayKYTs,977279,978959,the ability to outrun the warden should
_2jULayKYTs,978959,980959,the skulk make its way to them in these
_2jULayKYTs,980959,983120,strongholds they create the end portals
_2jULayKYTs,983120,984880,and use them to escape from this
_2jULayKYTs,984880,987440,unforgiving world only to then get stuck
_2jULayKYTs,987440,989440,on the other side so there you have it
_2jULayKYTs,989440,991600,the origin of one of minecraft's newest
_2jULayKYTs,991600,993839,and most dangerous mobs the warden isn't
_2jULayKYTs,993839,995360,a failed experiment but rather an
_2jULayKYTs,995360,997360,invasive species that came from another
_2jULayKYTs,997360,998800,world and while many are begging for a
_2jULayKYTs,998800,1000240,new dimension to be added to the game
_2jULayKYTs,1000240,1002480,disc 5 serves as a warning of what
_2jULayKYTs,1002480,1004000,happens when you open portals to
_2jULayKYTs,1004000,1006079,mysterious new lands if the warden is
_2jULayKYTs,1006079,1008079,what popped out last time i fear what
_2jULayKYTs,1008079,1010480,lies in wait should we open it again but
_2jULayKYTs,1010480,1014720,hey that's just a theory a game theory
_2jULayKYTs,1014720,1018360,thanks for watching
_2jULayKYTs,1020250,1023519,[Music]
_2jULayKYTs,1035760,1037839,you
