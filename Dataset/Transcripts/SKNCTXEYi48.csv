SKNCTXEYi48,880,3600,hello everyone want to see how the giant
SKNCTXEYi48,3600,6000,mcdonald's corporation makes its burgers
SKNCTXEYi48,6000,10080,and other stuff then let's get it on
SKNCTXEYi48,12240,14960,the process of making buns begins with
SKNCTXEYi48,14960,17600,dough to make it mcdonald's uses flour
SKNCTXEYi48,17600,20480,water liquid yeast and salt then the
SKNCTXEYi48,20480,22400,sponge is sent to a fermentation room
SKNCTXEYi48,22400,24880,for about four hours after that the
SKNCTXEYi48,24880,26880,dough goes down the chute and gets mixed
SKNCTXEYi48,26880,29279,with other ingredients for example sugar
SKNCTXEYi48,29279,31359,and salt but don't worry of course buns
SKNCTXEYi48,31359,33360,are not the most dietary product but
SKNCTXEYi48,33360,34960,they still contain less than five
SKNCTXEYi48,34960,37680,percent sugar at the next stage a huge
SKNCTXEYi48,37680,40079,machine twists the dough after which the
SKNCTXEYi48,40079,42640,conveyor shapes it into small balls then
SKNCTXEYi48,42640,44559,these balls are given a light dusting of
SKNCTXEYi48,44559,47120,flour and put into special baking pans
SKNCTXEYi48,47120,49440,then the balls have to stay there for 55
SKNCTXEYi48,49440,51840,minutes at a temperature of 100 degrees
SKNCTXEYi48,51840,54559,fahrenheit and a humidity of 90 percent
SKNCTXEYi48,54559,57520,so what else is left of course sesame
SKNCTXEYi48,57520,59039,seeds the buns are passed through a
SKNCTXEYi48,59039,61359,machine that applies an even coating of
SKNCTXEYi48,61359,63359,those and then the buns are sent into a
SKNCTXEYi48,63359,65680,huge oven for eight to nine minutes at a
SKNCTXEYi48,65680,68799,temperature of 465 degrees fahrenheit
SKNCTXEYi48,68799,70880,after the buns are thoroughly baked
SKNCTXEYi48,70880,76039,they're left on a special spiral cooler
SKNCTXEYi48,105520,108520,so
SKNCTXEYi48,116880,119040,where they cool down for about 27
SKNCTXEYi48,119040,121280,minutes after that they also have to be
SKNCTXEYi48,121280,123600,checked by specialists who inspect them
SKNCTXEYi48,123600,125840,and only then send them for slicing and
SKNCTXEYi48,125840,128000,packaging in the restaurants employees
SKNCTXEYi48,128000,132440,will brown them in a special oven
SKNCTXEYi48,147599,149760,meanwhile the process of making beef
SKNCTXEYi48,149760,152000,passes at mcdonald's is incredibly
SKNCTXEYi48,152000,153599,simple the beef arrives to the
SKNCTXEYi48,153599,155840,processing plant in special sealed
SKNCTXEYi48,155840,157599,trucks the meat is checked for its
SKNCTXEYi48,157599,159840,freshness and various bacteria after
SKNCTXEYi48,159840,162560,that lean and fat are mixed together and
SKNCTXEYi48,162560,164959,ground in a huge meat grinder that way
SKNCTXEYi48,164959,168000,they get 100 real beef like the ones you
SKNCTXEYi48,168000,171840,could buy at any grocery store
SKNCTXEYi48,190400,192480,the main secret of their beef patties is
SKNCTXEYi48,192480,194400,that as soon as the special device gives
SKNCTXEYi48,194400,196480,them shape they immediately go into a
SKNCTXEYi48,196480,199120,giant freezer where they stay for 24
SKNCTXEYi48,199120,201040,minutes after that they're packed and
SKNCTXEYi48,201040,202879,sent to the restaurants just think about
SKNCTXEYi48,202879,205440,these figures one such factory can
SKNCTXEYi48,205440,208560,produce about three million patties a
SKNCTXEYi48,208560,210560,day in the restaurants they're cooked on
SKNCTXEYi48,210560,212720,a double-sided hot plate until they
SKNCTXEYi48,212720,214239,reach an internal temperature of at
SKNCTXEYi48,214239,217599,least 155 degrees fahrenheit
SKNCTXEYi48,217599,220000,in order to grow high quality lettuce
SKNCTXEYi48,220000,224630,the land on farms is regularly checked
SKNCTXEYi48,224630,227729,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,240319,242239,after harvesting the vegetables are sent
SKNCTXEYi48,242239,243920,to the factory where they're thoroughly
SKNCTXEYi48,243920,247200,washed and disinfected
SKNCTXEYi48,251680,253840,next experts check the harvest for
SKNCTXEYi48,253840,256160,freshness and throw away any damaged
SKNCTXEYi48,256160,258639,leaves after that the lettuce is sliced
SKNCTXEYi48,258639,260639,or chopped depending on how it needs to
SKNCTXEYi48,260639,264359,be served at the restaurants
SKNCTXEYi48,271240,273440,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,273440,275070,so
SKNCTXEYi48,275070,287749,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,289960,293210,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,298080,300400,and here are the famous pickles we love
SKNCTXEYi48,300400,304520,so much in any burger
SKNCTXEYi48,307080,310300,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,333690,336800,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,350140,353240,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,356400,359039,the basis of the heinz ketchup recipe
SKNCTXEYi48,359039,362880,remains unchanged namely tomatoes sugar
SKNCTXEYi48,362880,366000,salt spices and vinegar the tomatoes for
SKNCTXEYi48,366000,368160,the ketchup are grown on special farms
SKNCTXEYi48,368160,371199,where producers use only selected seeds
SKNCTXEYi48,371199,373440,it is important for the future source
SKNCTXEYi48,373440,375600,that the tomatoes have a large amount of
SKNCTXEYi48,375600,378160,pulp and a low moisture content so that
SKNCTXEYi48,378160,380319,there would be no need to add starch to
SKNCTXEYi48,380319,381470,the product
SKNCTXEYi48,381470,384599,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,391840,394240,then spices are added to the tomato
SKNCTXEYi48,394240,396479,paste which are made from herbs hot
SKNCTXEYi48,396479,399039,peppers and vegetables the exact recipe
SKNCTXEYi48,399039,401600,is a closely guarded secret and the only
SKNCTXEYi48,401600,404639,known ingredient is celery after that
SKNCTXEYi48,404639,406479,the resulting mass is loaded into a
SKNCTXEYi48,406479,408960,mixing container and vinegar sugar and
SKNCTXEYi48,408960,410880,salt are added to it then the ketchup
SKNCTXEYi48,410880,413199,goes through a pasteurization stage
SKNCTXEYi48,413199,415440,after which it's put in a homogenizer a
SKNCTXEYi48,415440,417759,device that grinds all the components
SKNCTXEYi48,417759,420639,creating a homogeneous thick mass after
SKNCTXEYi48,420639,423199,that the ketchup must be cooled quickly
SKNCTXEYi48,423199,425599,this process as well as pasteurization
SKNCTXEYi48,425599,427919,is necessary for long-term storage of
SKNCTXEYi48,427919,431080,the product
SKNCTXEYi48,435900,441259,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,441680,443120,of course you can't make a burger
SKNCTXEYi48,443120,445199,without a good slice of cheese check out
SKNCTXEYi48,445199,448840,how they make them
SKNCTXEYi48,450080,453250,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,477710,480800,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,480800,482960,the path of the fish fillets to the
SKNCTXEYi48,482960,486400,restaurants begins in the sea first fish
SKNCTXEYi48,486400,491319,are caught with nets in large numbers
SKNCTXEYi48,495440,497520,after that they're sent to the factory
SKNCTXEYi48,497520,501400,to be washed and sorted
SKNCTXEYi48,503990,507069,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,509430,512578,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,525040,528040,so
SKNCTXEYi48,532310,540399,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,540399,542240,they're delivered to the next factory in
SKNCTXEYi48,542240,544560,the form of large fish blocks a special
SKNCTXEYi48,544560,547519,machine soars each block into 150
SKNCTXEYi48,547519,549760,portions after which moving further
SKNCTXEYi48,549760,551600,along the conveyor belts they're covered
SKNCTXEYi48,551600,553760,with a layer of batter after that the
SKNCTXEYi48,553760,556320,fish has to be frozen and a huge chamber
SKNCTXEYi48,556320,558880,manages that in just 8 minutes and of
SKNCTXEYi48,558880,560800,course the manufacturers don't want to
SKNCTXEYi48,560800,563519,offer you a bad product so they conduct
SKNCTXEYi48,563519,566000,a frying test on several portions that
SKNCTXEYi48,566000,567680,helps to make sure the fish fill it has
SKNCTXEYi48,567680,571440,a good taste smell and colour
SKNCTXEYi48,571440,574399,the fries begin their journey on farms
SKNCTXEYi48,574399,576480,potatoes are grown there with an optimal
SKNCTXEYi48,576480,578290,number of sunny days
SKNCTXEYi48,578290,589200,[Applause]
SKNCTXEYi48,589200,591360,after harvesting the potatoes are put
SKNCTXEYi48,591360,593680,into a huge potato pillar the principle
SKNCTXEYi48,593680,595839,of its operation is very similar to that
SKNCTXEYi48,595839,597760,of a washing machine but there is an
SKNCTXEYi48,597760,600480,abrasive inner surface in the drum after
SKNCTXEYi48,600480,602640,that the potatoes are sent further along
SKNCTXEYi48,602640,605120,the belt and thoroughly washed then each
SKNCTXEYi48,605120,607839,potato passes through a series of blades
SKNCTXEYi48,607839,610399,that cuts it into the fries we know it's
SKNCTXEYi48,610399,612079,important to note that at that moment
SKNCTXEYi48,612079,613920,the potatoes can move at a speed of up
SKNCTXEYi48,613920,618600,to 37 miles per hour
SKNCTXEYi48,625519,627519,you know that potatoes often have dark
SKNCTXEYi48,627519,630240,spots right to remove them laser and
SKNCTXEYi48,630240,632240,optical scanners are used which
SKNCTXEYi48,632240,634800,automatically detect defects and remove
SKNCTXEYi48,634800,636880,the imperfections with a stream of
SKNCTXEYi48,636880,639680,compressed air then the potato slices
SKNCTXEYi48,639680,642079,are dried on giant baking sheets at
SKNCTXEYi48,642079,644320,about the same time specialists conduct
SKNCTXEYi48,644320,646560,the last quality check after which they
SKNCTXEYi48,646560,650600,freeze and pack the potatoes
SKNCTXEYi48,660399,661920,all that's left to do then is for the
SKNCTXEYi48,661920,663760,potatoes to get to the restaurant where
SKNCTXEYi48,663760,666000,they'll be deep fried in oil with a high
SKNCTXEYi48,666000,670200,content of oleic acid
SKNCTXEYi48,677279,679519,what about coca-cola which is considered
SKNCTXEYi48,679519,681040,to be the most popular drink of
SKNCTXEYi48,681040,682959,mcdonald's the beverage production
SKNCTXEYi48,682959,685040,process begins with a multi-system of
SKNCTXEYi48,685040,687279,purification that water goes through
SKNCTXEYi48,687279,689519,then a mixture of sugar syrup and
SKNCTXEYi48,689519,691600,concentrate is added to the purified
SKNCTXEYi48,691600,693440,water the liquid then goes into a
SKNCTXEYi48,693440,695279,special machine where it's mixed and
SKNCTXEYi48,695279,697839,saturated with carbon dioxide then the
SKNCTXEYi48,697839,699760,finished drink is put into bottles that
SKNCTXEYi48,699760,701760,pass through a filled bottle inspection
SKNCTXEYi48,701760,703600,system that checks the height of the
SKNCTXEYi48,703600,705839,liquid and ensures the cap is placed
SKNCTXEYi48,705839,707519,properly if the system discovers
SKNCTXEYi48,707519,709600,something wrong it simply knocks the
SKNCTXEYi48,709600,711839,defective bottle off the conveyor belt
SKNCTXEYi48,711839,714160,then they put labels on the bottles and
SKNCTXEYi48,714160,716320,another machine prints the date time of
SKNCTXEYi48,716320,718480,bottling as well as the expiration date
SKNCTXEYi48,718480,721720,of the drink
SKNCTXEYi48,735680,738680,so
SKNCTXEYi48,767130,770289,[Music]
SKNCTXEYi48,778800,781519,the process begins with whole chickens
SKNCTXEYi48,781519,783680,the employees separate the breast feet
SKNCTXEYi48,783680,787160,for the muck nuggets
SKNCTXEYi48,793839,795680,after that the meat is sent to the
SKNCTXEYi48,795680,798079,blending room where it's ground up by a
SKNCTXEYi48,798079,800480,blender at this stage seasonings such as
SKNCTXEYi48,800480,802480,celery and black pepper are added to the
SKNCTXEYi48,802480,804720,mix as well as a bit of chicken skin for
SKNCTXEYi48,804720,807200,flavor and as a binder but those are not
SKNCTXEYi48,807200,809680,our favorite nuggets yet the resulting
SKNCTXEYi48,809680,811680,mixture is sent to a special forming
SKNCTXEYi48,811680,813519,machine that portions the blended
SKNCTXEYi48,813519,815680,chicken into four different shapes the
SKNCTXEYi48,815680,818399,ball the bell the boot and the bow tie
SKNCTXEYi48,818399,820399,then the shapes are covered with a light
SKNCTXEYi48,820399,822160,batter and a thicker batter called
SKNCTXEYi48,822160,825120,tempura after that they are par fried so
SKNCTXEYi48,825120,827120,that the batter stays in place if you
SKNCTXEYi48,827120,829360,break the nuggets in half at this stage
SKNCTXEYi48,829360,832160,you will find raw blended chicken inside
SKNCTXEYi48,832160,834160,the thing is they'll be fully cooked in
SKNCTXEYi48,834160,836560,the restaurant so that they stay fresh
SKNCTXEYi48,836560,838560,so after being par fried the
SKNCTXEYi48,838560,840480,semi-finished nuggets are frozen and
SKNCTXEYi48,840480,842399,packed in a special room where they wait
SKNCTXEYi48,842399,844000,for their shipment to a mcdonald's
SKNCTXEYi48,844000,847000,restaurant
SKNCTXEYi48,856050,861419,[Music]
