XcrFwgDUV9E,285840,288080,right maybe it's best we moved on to the
XcrFwgDUV9E,288080,289680,next set of exclusives from education
XcrFwgDUV9E,289680,291440,edition as you can see over here in the
XcrFwgDUV9E,291440,293040,distance we've got some signs that
XcrFwgDUV9E,293040,294240,differ from the ones you're used to
XcrFwgDUV9E,294240,296639,seeing in regular minecraft actually
XcrFwgDUV9E,296639,298720,hold on it looks like someone was riding
XcrFwgDUV9E,298720,299600,on them
XcrFwgDUV9E,299600,301919,how weird they usually
XcrFwgDUV9E,301919,303120,actually
XcrFwgDUV9E,303120,305280,hold on a second
XcrFwgDUV9E,305280,307199,uh
XcrFwgDUV9E,307199,308639,anyways they come in three different
XcrFwgDUV9E,308639,311280,sizes and the you know what okay we're
XcrFwgDUV9E,311280,312800,just gonna move on man this place was
XcrFwgDUV9E,312800,315220,creeping me out at least i
XcrFwgDUV9E,315220,317039,[Music]
XcrFwgDUV9E,317039,318320,now i'm just teasing three of the new
XcrFwgDUV9E,318320,320720,items are the slate the poster and the
XcrFwgDUV9E,320720,322400,board these are three different signs
XcrFwgDUV9E,322400,323840,that you can write on and add to your
XcrFwgDUV9E,323840,325919,minecraft world now it's really fun you
XcrFwgDUV9E,325919,327199,can literally just type it in and it
XcrFwgDUV9E,327199,329120,will actually appear live as you're
XcrFwgDUV9E,329120,331919,typing it hello there i see you reading
XcrFwgDUV9E,331919,335280,me well now you can't
XcrFwgDUV9E,335280,337520,i can't i can't type as fast as i speak
XcrFwgDUV9E,337520,338960,all the same though you got three
XcrFwgDUV9E,338960,341520,different sizes a one by one a one by
XcrFwgDUV9E,341520,344000,two and then what's this big ol right
XcrFwgDUV9E,344000,346960,here oh i can't even fit it yo he's huge
XcrFwgDUV9E,346960,348560,it's like a straight old white board and
XcrFwgDUV9E,348560,352400,again you can see it instantly
XcrFwgDUV9E,352400,355280,yes excellent and you can place it as
XcrFwgDUV9E,355280,357360,you see here on either the floor or
XcrFwgDUV9E,357360,359280,against a wall and it will work just
XcrFwgDUV9E,359280,361680,fine like those speaking of walls what
XcrFwgDUV9E,361680,363360,you see right here are three additional
XcrFwgDUV9E,363360,365440,types of building blocks that education
XcrFwgDUV9E,365440,368160,edition features as well they are the
XcrFwgDUV9E,368160,370639,allow block the deny block and the
XcrFwgDUV9E,370639,372720,border block now these are mostly used
XcrFwgDUV9E,372720,374800,in multiplayer situations with education
XcrFwgDUV9E,374800,376720,edition involving a teacher and their
XcrFwgDUV9E,376720,378720,students essentially the allow block
XcrFwgDUV9E,378720,381759,allows you to set an area for builders
XcrFwgDUV9E,381759,384000,to actually build within the world the
XcrFwgDUV9E,384000,385440,teacher can set world builders as
XcrFwgDUV9E,385440,387759,opposed to regular old peons they just
XcrFwgDUV9E,387759,389520,gotta deal with all the cool people
XcrFwgDUV9E,389520,391039,getting creative mode except for them
XcrFwgDUV9E,391039,392639,and you'll be able to build over areas
XcrFwgDUV9E,392639,394800,that have the allow block now the deny
XcrFwgDUV9E,394800,396960,block works exactly the same way but
XcrFwgDUV9E,396960,399840,opposite anything placed above a
XcrFwgDUV9E,399840,401360,deny block
XcrFwgDUV9E,401360,402639,you'll be denied from being able to
XcrFwgDUV9E,402639,404479,create or delete now obviously you see
XcrFwgDUV9E,404479,405840,me being able to do it but that's
XcrFwgDUV9E,405840,408319,because i am the operator i'm an op on
XcrFwgDUV9E,408319,409919,this world and there's a single player
XcrFwgDUV9E,409919,411199,one as well these are more for
XcrFwgDUV9E,411199,413360,multiplayer experiences now what we have
XcrFwgDUV9E,413360,415680,right here is the border block this is a
XcrFwgDUV9E,415680,418000,way to keep your students slash
XcrFwgDUV9E,418000,420240,friends slash enemy slash whomever
XcrFwgDUV9E,420240,423280,located within this area now again
XcrFwgDUV9E,423280,425360,because i'm an operator i can fly right
XcrFwgDUV9E,425360,427120,over this but normally if you are a
XcrFwgDUV9E,427120,429520,plain old student or a non-op trying to
XcrFwgDUV9E,429520,431599,go over this will actually push you back
XcrFwgDUV9E,431599,433520,to where you were previously and not
XcrFwgDUV9E,433520,435680,only that but you can actually put
XcrFwgDUV9E,435680,438160,borders underground and they will work
XcrFwgDUV9E,438160,440800,to keep players from passing both above
XcrFwgDUV9E,440800,442400,and below the fence so even if this is
XcrFwgDUV9E,442400,444240,underground if we tried to go over it as
XcrFwgDUV9E,444240,446720,a non-op we would not be able to similar
XcrFwgDUV9E,446720,448720,down here if we tried to go underneath
XcrFwgDUV9E,448720,450560,it we also would not be able to now i
XcrFwgDUV9E,450560,452000,can't really show this off in the single
XcrFwgDUV9E,452000,453520,player experience but at least you know
XcrFwgDUV9E,453520,455120,how they work now yeah
XcrFwgDUV9E,455120,456639,now one of the final major differences
XcrFwgDUV9E,456639,458319,between education edition and the other
XcrFwgDUV9E,458319,460560,editions of minecraft is this baby right
XcrFwgDUV9E,460560,463440,here now what is it you say huh well
XcrFwgDUV9E,463440,464800,let's go ahead and get our picture
XcrFwgDUV9E,464800,466319,snapped and you can get a better
XcrFwgDUV9E,466319,468240,understanding of what you just witnessed
XcrFwgDUV9E,468240,471039,which ah it's literally a camera we got
XcrFwgDUV9E,471039,472879,a camera we can search for right here
XcrFwgDUV9E,472879,475759,camera yes this is an item for education
XcrFwgDUV9E,475759,477680,edition only and it's used in
XcrFwgDUV9E,477680,479680,conjunction with another special item
XcrFwgDUV9E,479680,482879,known as the portfolio to log your
XcrFwgDUV9E,482879,485360,experiences around your minecraft world
XcrFwgDUV9E,485360,487919,now i believe we should document this
XcrFwgDUV9E,487919,490000,amazing landscaping job we did to
XcrFwgDUV9E,490000,491680,improve this village it looks really
XcrFwgDUV9E,491680,493520,good and i feel like adding it to my
XcrFwgDUV9E,493520,495919,portfolio so what i'm going to do is add
XcrFwgDUV9E,495919,498960,a series of cameras all over the place
XcrFwgDUV9E,498960,500800,and we're going to just try our best to
XcrFwgDUV9E,500800,502319,get as many of these pictures snapped as
XcrFwgDUV9E,502319,504080,possible the way it actually activates
XcrFwgDUV9E,504080,505840,is by right clicking it and then the
XcrFwgDUV9E,505840,507919,camera head will follow you around as
XcrFwgDUV9E,507919,509120,you start to right click the rest of
XcrFwgDUV9E,509120,510240,these things look at it look at this
XcrFwgDUV9E,510240,511199,yeah
XcrFwgDUV9E,511199,513200,you can see me moving
XcrFwgDUV9E,513200,515200,you gotta be kidding me it's taking him
XcrFwgDUV9E,515200,517760,live it actually will rotate as you're
XcrFwgDUV9E,517760,520080,moving around and it will get moved into
XcrFwgDUV9E,520080,522000,the portfolio the moment the picture is
XcrFwgDUV9E,522000,524159,taken so watch press you press you and
XcrFwgDUV9E,524159,526320,you'll see they actually start to follow
XcrFwgDUV9E,526320,528720,me now watch this
XcrFwgDUV9E,528720,529600,yeah
XcrFwgDUV9E,529600,531839,that was a great fall did you love that
XcrFwgDUV9E,531839,534560,now unfortunately you can't make them
XcrFwgDUV9E,534560,536000,you can't remotely activate them you
XcrFwgDUV9E,536000,537680,can't use redstone to activate them from
