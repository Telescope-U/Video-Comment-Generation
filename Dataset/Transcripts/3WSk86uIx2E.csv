3WSk86uIx2E,30,3750,Theodor Seuss Geisel aka dr. Seuss which
3WSk86uIx2E,3750,5790,originally is supposed to be pronounced
3WSk86uIx2E,5790,8309,dr. sois but I'm not going to say that
3WSk86uIx2E,8309,10080,because there's probably only like five
3WSk86uIx2E,10080,11880,people on the planet who pronounce it
3WSk86uIx2E,11880,13769,that way and Geisel himself eventually
3WSk86uIx2E,13769,16198,switched to the anglicized version dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,16198,17730,Seuss was one of the most famous and
3WSk86uIx2E,17730,19619,successful children's book authors and
3WSk86uIx2E,19619,21600,illustrators in the world with his book
3WSk86uIx2E,21600,23460,selling more than half a billion copies
3WSk86uIx2E,23460,25830,and for many of us his works produced
3WSk86uIx2E,25830,28080,cherished childhood memories and while
3WSk86uIx2E,28080,30390,his use of language and his storytelling
3WSk86uIx2E,30390,31859,abilities are something to be admired
3WSk86uIx2E,31859,34469,his artwork was also a memorable and
3WSk86uIx2E,34469,36840,integral part to his stories dr. Seuss
3WSk86uIx2E,36840,39239,is signature wacky gravity defying art
3WSk86uIx2E,39239,41700,style is unmatched in its uniqueness and
3WSk86uIx2E,41700,43950,while we all know dr. Seuss mainly for
3WSk86uIx2E,43950,45180,his excellent children's books
3WSk86uIx2E,45180,47219,animations and the maybe not so
3WSk86uIx2E,47219,48930,excellent films made after his death
3WSk86uIx2E,48930,50910,there are many artworks that are not as
3WSk86uIx2E,50910,52829,known but still definitely worth talking
3WSk86uIx2E,52829,55680,about dr. Seuss began as a cartoonist in
3WSk86uIx2E,55680,57899,the 1920s for magazines and other
3WSk86uIx2E,57899,60449,publications such as life and Vanity
3WSk86uIx2E,60449,63480,Fair in 1931 dr. Seuss illustrated a
3WSk86uIx2E,63480,67560,book called the pocket book of boners mm
3WSk86uIx2E,67560,68820,at the time
3WSk86uIx2E,68820,70710,boner did not have the sexual
3WSk86uIx2E,70710,72360,connotation it has today
3WSk86uIx2E,72360,75030,and originally meant a silly mistake it
3WSk86uIx2E,75030,76590,was a humorous book full of
3WSk86uIx2E,76590,78509,illustrations and was one of the
3WSk86uIx2E,78509,80430,best-selling paperbacks of World War 2
3WSk86uIx2E,80430,83189,this book was actually a collection of
3WSk86uIx2E,83189,86189,four books titled boners more boners
3WSk86uIx2E,86189,89970,still more boners prized boners and then
3WSk86uIx2E,89970,92159,even more compilations were released
3WSk86uIx2E,92159,95579,titled the Omnibus boners and the second
3WSk86uIx2E,95579,98360,omnibus boners that's a lot of boners in
3WSk86uIx2E,98360,100920,1937 Ted Geisel wrote and illustrated
3WSk86uIx2E,100920,103530,his first children's book and to think I
3WSk86uIx2E,103530,105450,saw it on Mulberry Street which had
3WSk86uIx2E,105450,107490,lackluster sales but garnered glowing
3WSk86uIx2E,107490,109590,reviews because of its imaginative story
3WSk86uIx2E,109590,112680,and visuals around the 1930s dr. Seuss
3WSk86uIx2E,112680,114540,collected things like antlers and other
3WSk86uIx2E,114540,116640,leftovers from dead animals which his
3WSk86uIx2E,116640,118469,father would send him as he worked at
3WSk86uIx2E,118469,120329,the Springfield Zoo he would take these
3WSk86uIx2E,120329,122670,parts combine them with paper mache and
3WSk86uIx2E,122670,124829,paint and transformed them into busts of
3WSk86uIx2E,124829,126689,fictional creatures he called the
3WSk86uIx2E,126689,128550,eventual eighteen sculptures that would
3WSk86uIx2E,128550,129780,result from this process
3WSk86uIx2E,129780,132300,unorthodox taxidermy some of my
3WSk86uIx2E,132300,134010,favorites have to be the Gugu
3WSk86uIx2E,134010,136290,Tasmanian wool gassed the Mulberry
3WSk86uIx2E,136290,138900,Street unicorn the seagoing dilemma fish
3WSk86uIx2E,138900,141180,and the sawfish that one has a
3WSk86uIx2E,141180,143849,surprisingly normal title later but
3WSk86uIx2E,143849,145500,still pretty early in his career he
3WSk86uIx2E,145500,148200,became a political cartoonist and during
3WSk86uIx2E,148200,151019,World War Two produced over 400 cartoons
3WSk86uIx2E,151019,153150,the funny thing about these drawings is
3WSk86uIx2E,153150,155190,that many of them contain creatures and
3WSk86uIx2E,155190,157260,caricatures that are very familiar to
3WSk86uIx2E,157260,159120,the wacky animals later seen in his
3WSk86uIx2E,159120,161370,children's books so it gets very surreal
3WSk86uIx2E,161370,163260,when you see something like horton
3WSk86uIx2E,163260,165900,representing the GOP and adolf hitler
3WSk86uIx2E,165900,168090,drawn in his signature whimsical style
3WSk86uIx2E,168090,170609,but just to be absolutely clear dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,170609,172739,Seuss was very opposed to fascism and
3WSk86uIx2E,172739,174810,American isolationism during World War
3WSk86uIx2E,174810,176790,two but he wasn't always on the right
3WSk86uIx2E,176790,178709,side of history especially when you
3WSk86uIx2E,178709,182819,highlight these two comics Oh ooh these
3WSk86uIx2E,182819,185940,are these are spicy these are very spicy
3WSk86uIx2E,185940,188609,of course you have to keep in mind the
3WSk86uIx2E,188609,190440,time period when these depictions were
3WSk86uIx2E,190440,192840,acceptable and yes he did support the
3WSk86uIx2E,192840,194790,Japanese internment camps at the time
3WSk86uIx2E,194790,197489,but clearly his ideas changed quite a
3WSk86uIx2E,197489,199859,bit later on these political cartoons
3WSk86uIx2E,199859,202199,while interesting are not as polished or
3WSk86uIx2E,202199,203819,witty as the children's books he would
3WSk86uIx2E,203819,206280,later write dr. Seuss's art style has
3WSk86uIx2E,206280,207810,remained very consistent throughout
3WSk86uIx2E,207810,209940,pretty much all of his career to
3WSk86uIx2E,209940,211709,demonstrate this you can take a quick
3WSk86uIx2E,211709,213629,glance at any of the advertisements that
3WSk86uIx2E,213629,215730,he Illustrated and immediately recognize
3WSk86uIx2E,215730,218160,his signature style anything from Ford
3WSk86uIx2E,218160,220949,to Standard Oil to a detailed drawing of
3WSk86uIx2E,220949,222720,hell for General Electric
3WSk86uIx2E,222720,224790,I cannot understate how unique and
3WSk86uIx2E,224790,227010,recognizable Ted geysell's art style was
3WSk86uIx2E,227010,229560,his figures are simple yet complicated
3WSk86uIx2E,229560,232889,plain and rounded droopy faces contrast
3WSk86uIx2E,232889,234959,with intricate cross hatching on things
3WSk86uIx2E,234959,237060,like clothes and fur his characters are
3WSk86uIx2E,237060,239310,very gestural and lively and his
3WSk86uIx2E,239310,241319,buildings and machinery are no different
3WSk86uIx2E,241319,243480,they often seem to defy gravity and
3WSk86uIx2E,243480,246180,rarely contain any straight lines the
3WSk86uIx2E,246180,248220,use of cross hatching and reliance on
3WSk86uIx2E,248220,250169,pen and ink along with the strategic
3WSk86uIx2E,250169,252569,flat colors seen in most of his books
3WSk86uIx2E,252569,254879,probably comes from his experience as a
3WSk86uIx2E,254879,257010,cartoonist with the goal of keeping the
3WSk86uIx2E,257010,259019,interest of younger audiences and
3WSk86uIx2E,259019,261209,combined with the ridiculous designs of
3WSk86uIx2E,261209,263490,his creatures and machines they all form
3WSk86uIx2E,263490,265770,an identity that is overwhelmingly and
3WSk86uIx2E,265770,267720,undeniably Seussian
3WSk86uIx2E,267720,270300,the rhymes inventive made-up words and
3WSk86uIx2E,270300,272040,timeless storytelling are the core of
3WSk86uIx2E,272040,273360,his children's books
3WSk86uIx2E,273360,275250,the imagery he uses to bring that
3WSk86uIx2E,275250,277500,whimsical poetry into visual forms is
3WSk86uIx2E,277500,279540,essential to the experience of a dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,279540,281520,Seuss work and what makes this style
3WSk86uIx2E,281520,283200,more intriguing is when it's put into
3WSk86uIx2E,283200,285330,different situations from political
3WSk86uIx2E,285330,287580,cartoons to taxidermy but there is
3WSk86uIx2E,287580,289590,another collection of lesser-known dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,289590,290940,Seuss art that I find the most
3WSk86uIx2E,290940,293040,interesting of them all dozens of
3WSk86uIx2E,293040,294900,paintings that dr. Seuss made in private
3WSk86uIx2E,294900,296910,and were not to be released until after
3WSk86uIx2E,296910,299400,his death a collection he liked to call
3WSk86uIx2E,299400,304950,the midnight paintings what strikes most
3WSk86uIx2E,304950,306900,people first about these paintings is
3WSk86uIx2E,306900,308310,how different they are from his
3WSk86uIx2E,308310,310140,mainstream works there's a lot more
3WSk86uIx2E,310140,312330,black in other colors in these works and
3WSk86uIx2E,312330,314010,many of them have a more ethereal
3WSk86uIx2E,314010,316350,quality clearly these paintings were
3WSk86uIx2E,316350,318390,made for more emotive and leisure goals
3WSk86uIx2E,318390,320910,rather than storytelling ones it's hard
3WSk86uIx2E,320910,322740,to summarize the many paintings he
3WSk86uIx2E,322740,324810,produced behind closed doors so it's
3WSk86uIx2E,324810,326160,really best to approach them
3WSk86uIx2E,326160,329220,case-by-case the secret dr. Seuss works
3WSk86uIx2E,329220,331470,have a variety of styles and subjects
3WSk86uIx2E,331470,333960,this painting titled cat detective in
3WSk86uIx2E,333960,336180,the wrong part of town is reminiscent of
3WSk86uIx2E,336180,338520,Kubis works but with brighter colors and
3WSk86uIx2E,338520,340620,typical Seussian architecture a few
3WSk86uIx2E,340620,342690,other paintings contain a similar style
3WSk86uIx2E,342690,345240,but for subjects like resorts others are
3WSk86uIx2E,345240,347400,more dramatic forcing the viewer into
3WSk86uIx2E,347400,349530,unorthodox perspectives like this Dutch
3WSk86uIx2E,349530,351840,angle view of blobs of color leaping out
3WSk86uIx2E,351840,353790,of a brightly colored ocean or this
3WSk86uIx2E,353790,355740,drastically curved landscape that seems
3WSk86uIx2E,355740,358770,to extend for infinity some are entirely
3WSk86uIx2E,358770,361290,abstract others are more pattern based
3WSk86uIx2E,361290,363419,like this painting of dozens of
3WSk86uIx2E,363419,365400,working-class Birds walking up and down
3WSk86uIx2E,365400,367770,made to express geysell's economic
3WSk86uIx2E,367770,370169,concerns then this painting a plethora
3WSk86uIx2E,370169,373740,of cats was made for a simple reason to
3WSk86uIx2E,373740,376200,show a lot of cats but more specifically
3WSk86uIx2E,376200,378660,as a form of relaxation to see how many
3WSk86uIx2E,378660,380880,cats he could paint in and how many are
3WSk86uIx2E,380880,385110,on this one canvas exactly 392 a more
3WSk86uIx2E,385110,386910,satirical set of works called the la
3WSk86uIx2E,386910,389130,jolla bird women resulted from Geisel
3WSk86uIx2E,389130,390960,people watching from his La Jolla tower
3WSk86uIx2E,390960,393810,studio these thin bird folk were made to
3WSk86uIx2E,393810,396060,gently poke fun at his neighbors and as
3WSk86uIx2E,396060,396810,you would expect
3WSk86uIx2E,396810,399450,they are quite simple they're women but
3WSk86uIx2E,399450,401520,birds the works I think are most
3WSk86uIx2E,401520,403289,interesting are the ones that are darker
3WSk86uIx2E,403289,405539,both in color schemes and subject matter
3WSk86uIx2E,405539,408300,a very simple painting titled cat in
3WSk86uIx2E,408300,409440,obsolete shower-bath
3WSk86uIx2E,409440,411389,demonstrates the purely aesthetic
3WSk86uIx2E,411389,413460,choices of the darker paintings the
3WSk86uIx2E,413460,415379,brushstrokes and layering of color is
3WSk86uIx2E,415379,417810,erratic there's no flat or smooth colors
3WSk86uIx2E,417810,420629,just textural grungy spots forming the
3WSk86uIx2E,420629,422610,environment the greenish yellow of the
3WSk86uIx2E,422610,424620,shower curtain is reminiscent of mold
3WSk86uIx2E,424620,426629,there is speculation this is meant to
3WSk86uIx2E,426629,428610,represent how early in his life Ted
3WSk86uIx2E,428610,430409,Geisel had to spend time in dingy
3WSk86uIx2E,430409,431940,one-room apartments
3WSk86uIx2E,431940,433949,these overlapping gradients and textural
3WSk86uIx2E,433949,435930,painting is a far cry from the clean
3WSk86uIx2E,435930,437970,calculated coloring of his children's
3WSk86uIx2E,437970,439949,books and many of these paintings seem
3WSk86uIx2E,439949,442470,to represent a seer almost cynical
3WSk86uIx2E,442470,444659,aspect we didn't usually see in his art
3WSk86uIx2E,444659,446940,one of my favorite paintings cat from
3WSk86uIx2E,446940,448949,the wrong side of the tracks seems to
3WSk86uIx2E,448949,451169,imply just from the title the subject is
3WSk86uIx2E,451169,453150,an inversion of the child-friendly cat
3WSk86uIx2E,453150,455520,in the hat' the face is more angular his
3WSk86uIx2E,455520,458430,whiskers unkempt and his aura is overall
3WSk86uIx2E,458430,460800,more sinister to complement this we get
3WSk86uIx2E,460800,462539,more sushi in architecture but applied
3WSk86uIx2E,462539,464460,to a pool table with a bunch of nonsense
3WSk86uIx2E,464460,466650,angles and extreme Distortion
3WSk86uIx2E,466650,468539,one of my favorite details is the beads
3WSk86uIx2E,468539,470610,above his head everyone knows the saying
3WSk86uIx2E,470610,473219,a cat has nine lives right well let's
3WSk86uIx2E,473219,474840,just say that it seems eight of his
3WSk86uIx2E,474840,477150,beads are used up and there seems to be
3WSk86uIx2E,477150,478620,just one left
3WSk86uIx2E,478620,481110,a similar painting indistinct cat with
3WSk86uIx2E,481110,483599,cigar develops a theory that these cat
3WSk86uIx2E,483599,485580,representations could be something of an
3WSk86uIx2E,485580,486389,alter-ego
3WSk86uIx2E,486389,488460,considering that dr. Seuss was a
3WSk86uIx2E,488460,490409,lifelong smoker and just like how we
3WSk86uIx2E,490409,492659,never smoked where a child might see him
3WSk86uIx2E,492659,494880,these paintings too remained hidden it's
3WSk86uIx2E,494880,496800,hard to find any self-portraits of his
3WSk86uIx2E,496800,498990,that are positive or Pleasant one of
3WSk86uIx2E,498990,500599,them is quite blatantly titled
3WSk86uIx2E,500599,502800,self-portrait of the artist worrying
3WSk86uIx2E,502800,504870,about his next book so it seems to me
3WSk86uIx2E,504870,506610,some of these works might have been dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,506610,509639,Seuss's version of vent art well that's
3WSk86uIx2E,509639,511979,probably an oversimplification but you
3WSk86uIx2E,511979,512789,get what I mean
3WSk86uIx2E,512789,514770,probably one of the creepiest darker
3WSk86uIx2E,514770,517169,paintings is surly cat being ejected
3WSk86uIx2E,517169,519599,where this grotesquely long cat is being
3WSk86uIx2E,519599,521940,sent away by this almost faceless
3WSk86uIx2E,521940,524159,mannequin like woman in the dead of
3WSk86uIx2E,524159,526560,night it's hard to pinpoint exactly why
3WSk86uIx2E,526560,529200,I find this work slightly unsettling but
3WSk86uIx2E,529200,530880,I would guess it's the combination of
3WSk86uIx2E,530880,533040,all the uncanny and distorted elements
3WSk86uIx2E,533040,535230,of course in contrast there are many ho
3WSk86uIx2E,535230,537240,full and bright paintings such as this
3WSk86uIx2E,537240,539790,sunny seascape full of roaring waves and
3WSk86uIx2E,539790,541980,the impossibly long tail of a bird being
3WSk86uIx2E,541980,544020,manipulated by the great swirls and
3WSk86uIx2E,544020,546480,fluctuations of the wind the dynamic
3WSk86uIx2E,546480,548370,shapes that Geisel so masterfully
3WSk86uIx2E,548370,550410,produces gives this painting a great
3WSk86uIx2E,550410,552690,sense of energy and movement then there
3WSk86uIx2E,552690,554460,are paintings that walk a delicate
3WSk86uIx2E,554460,556620,middle ground between melancholy and
3WSk86uIx2E,556620,558960,hopefulness such as the great cat
3WSk86uIx2E,558960,561110,continuum made during his later years
3WSk86uIx2E,561110,563910,dr. Seuss's cat seems to walk through an
3WSk86uIx2E,563910,565860,enormous line of windows from one
3WSk86uIx2E,565860,567930,experience to the next each with
3WSk86uIx2E,567930,569340,slightly different shapes and
3WSk86uIx2E,569340,571290,distortions there are a few with
3WSk86uIx2E,571290,573240,biblical meanings such as this depiction
3WSk86uIx2E,573240,575670,of the Tower of Babel or this cat named
3WSk86uIx2E,575670,577800,Joseph cats sporting a brightly colored
3WSk86uIx2E,577800,580410,outfit clearly alluding to the story of
3WSk86uIx2E,580410,582360,Joseph and his brothers but the ones
3WSk86uIx2E,582360,584340,that are my favorite come from a stage
3WSk86uIx2E,584340,586410,in the midnight paintings often referred
3WSk86uIx2E,586410,589380,to as sky Souls Deco period referring to
3WSk86uIx2E,589380,590940,the black backgrounds in golden
3WSk86uIx2E,590940,593240,structures the iconic and strange
3WSk86uIx2E,593240,595350,asymmetrical slightly organic
3WSk86uIx2E,595350,598200,architecture is illogical almost alien
3WSk86uIx2E,598200,600870,even more so than in his books because
3WSk86uIx2E,600870,603000,this time there is few basic structures
3WSk86uIx2E,603000,605100,to even signify something inhabitable
3WSk86uIx2E,605100,607770,not even a window or roof the only thing
3WSk86uIx2E,607770,609480,that is an indicator are the stairs
3WSk86uIx2E,609480,612090,stairs that seem to lead nowhere and
3WSk86uIx2E,612090,614100,when you have this architecture set in
3WSk86uIx2E,614100,616260,front of an almost pure black background
3WSk86uIx2E,616260,618510,both with a single creature resting in
3WSk86uIx2E,618510,620490,the middle you get this immense sense of
3WSk86uIx2E,620490,623250,isolation abandonment even it is
3WSk86uIx2E,623250,624960,difficult to assume that the people who
3WSk86uIx2E,624960,626610,built these structures are even living
3WSk86uIx2E,626610,628230,there anymore but the creatures
3WSk86uIx2E,628230,629850,currently relaxing in these structures
3WSk86uIx2E,629850,632460,are happy they are a beacon of life and
3WSk86uIx2E,632460,634500,hope and that's why with this sense of
3WSk86uIx2E,634500,636690,isolation you also get this immense
3WSk86uIx2E,636690,638760,sense of tranquility other deco
3WSk86uIx2E,638760,640920,paintings give off similar feelings but
3WSk86uIx2E,640920,643080,not as intensely as these two when I
3WSk86uIx2E,643080,645060,first heard about these secret paintings
3WSk86uIx2E,645060,646980,I wanted to find some sort of code to
3WSk86uIx2E,646980,649170,crack some puzzle or hidden meaning
3WSk86uIx2E,649170,650850,behind these private works that could
3WSk86uIx2E,650850,652920,possibly unlock some of dr. Seuss's
3WSk86uIx2E,652920,655740,genius or give some magical window into
3WSk86uIx2E,655740,658440,the man's soul or reveal some deep dark
3WSk86uIx2E,658440,661230,secret but of course these paintings are
3WSk86uIx2E,661230,663720,a variety of things none of them really
3WSk86uIx2E,663720,666150,gossip worthy and while they do reveal
3WSk86uIx2E,666150,668070,some sides to Ted Geisel that were
3WSk86uIx2E,668070,669120,previously on
3WSk86uIx2E,669120,672420,they're also fun humorous and Express
3WSk86uIx2E,672420,674699,his imagination just as well as in his
3WSk86uIx2E,674699,677100,books but with more coloring and subject
3WSk86uIx2E,677100,679259,matter freedom the many atmospheres and
3WSk86uIx2E,679259,680759,moods expressed in the midnight
3WSk86uIx2E,680759,682649,paintings are often different from his
3WSk86uIx2E,682649,684509,books but I can say with utmost
3WSk86uIx2E,684509,689029,confidence they are just as creative
3WSk86uIx2E,690210,696180,[Music]
3WSk86uIx2E,696180,698240,you
3WSk86uIx2E,701990,705190,[Music]
3WSk86uIx2E,709089,711430,you're not just wrong you're stupid now
3WSk86uIx2E,711430,714540,wait just a minute
vid,start,end,text
3WSk86uIx2E,30,3750,Theodor Seuss Geisel aka dr. Seuss which
3WSk86uIx2E,3750,5790,originally is supposed to be pronounced
3WSk86uIx2E,5790,8309,dr. sois but I'm not going to say that
3WSk86uIx2E,8309,10080,because there's probably only like five
3WSk86uIx2E,10080,11880,people on the planet who pronounce it
3WSk86uIx2E,11880,13769,that way and Geisel himself eventually
3WSk86uIx2E,13769,16198,switched to the anglicized version dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,16198,17730,Seuss was one of the most famous and
3WSk86uIx2E,17730,19619,successful children's book authors and
3WSk86uIx2E,19619,21600,illustrators in the world with his book
3WSk86uIx2E,21600,23460,selling more than half a billion copies
3WSk86uIx2E,23460,25830,and for many of us his works produced
3WSk86uIx2E,25830,28080,cherished childhood memories and while
3WSk86uIx2E,28080,30390,his use of language and his storytelling
3WSk86uIx2E,30390,31859,abilities are something to be admired
3WSk86uIx2E,31859,34469,his artwork was also a memorable and
3WSk86uIx2E,34469,36840,integral part to his stories dr. Seuss
3WSk86uIx2E,36840,39239,is signature wacky gravity defying art
3WSk86uIx2E,39239,41700,style is unmatched in its uniqueness and
3WSk86uIx2E,41700,43950,while we all know dr. Seuss mainly for
3WSk86uIx2E,43950,45180,his excellent children's books
3WSk86uIx2E,45180,47219,animations and the maybe not so
3WSk86uIx2E,47219,48930,excellent films made after his death
3WSk86uIx2E,48930,50910,there are many artworks that are not as
3WSk86uIx2E,50910,52829,known but still definitely worth talking
3WSk86uIx2E,52829,55680,about dr. Seuss began as a cartoonist in
3WSk86uIx2E,55680,57899,the 1920s for magazines and other
3WSk86uIx2E,57899,60449,publications such as life and Vanity
3WSk86uIx2E,60449,63480,Fair in 1931 dr. Seuss illustrated a
3WSk86uIx2E,63480,67560,book called the pocket book of boners mm
3WSk86uIx2E,67560,68820,at the time
3WSk86uIx2E,68820,70710,boner did not have the sexual
3WSk86uIx2E,70710,72360,connotation it has today
3WSk86uIx2E,72360,75030,and originally meant a silly mistake it
3WSk86uIx2E,75030,76590,was a humorous book full of
3WSk86uIx2E,76590,78509,illustrations and was one of the
3WSk86uIx2E,78509,80430,best-selling paperbacks of World War 2
3WSk86uIx2E,80430,83189,this book was actually a collection of
3WSk86uIx2E,83189,86189,four books titled boners more boners
3WSk86uIx2E,86189,89970,still more boners prized boners and then
3WSk86uIx2E,89970,92159,even more compilations were released
3WSk86uIx2E,92159,95579,titled the Omnibus boners and the second
3WSk86uIx2E,95579,98360,omnibus boners that's a lot of boners in
3WSk86uIx2E,98360,100920,1937 Ted Geisel wrote and illustrated
3WSk86uIx2E,100920,103530,his first children's book and to think I
3WSk86uIx2E,103530,105450,saw it on Mulberry Street which had
3WSk86uIx2E,105450,107490,lackluster sales but garnered glowing
3WSk86uIx2E,107490,109590,reviews because of its imaginative story
3WSk86uIx2E,109590,112680,and visuals around the 1930s dr. Seuss
3WSk86uIx2E,112680,114540,collected things like antlers and other
3WSk86uIx2E,114540,116640,leftovers from dead animals which his
3WSk86uIx2E,116640,118469,father would send him as he worked at
3WSk86uIx2E,118469,120329,the Springfield Zoo he would take these
3WSk86uIx2E,120329,122670,parts combine them with paper mache and
3WSk86uIx2E,122670,124829,paint and transformed them into busts of
3WSk86uIx2E,124829,126689,fictional creatures he called the
3WSk86uIx2E,126689,128550,eventual eighteen sculptures that would
3WSk86uIx2E,128550,129780,result from this process
3WSk86uIx2E,129780,132300,unorthodox taxidermy some of my
3WSk86uIx2E,132300,134010,favorites have to be the Gugu
3WSk86uIx2E,134010,136290,Tasmanian wool gassed the Mulberry
3WSk86uIx2E,136290,138900,Street unicorn the seagoing dilemma fish
3WSk86uIx2E,138900,141180,and the sawfish that one has a
3WSk86uIx2E,141180,143849,surprisingly normal title later but
3WSk86uIx2E,143849,145500,still pretty early in his career he
3WSk86uIx2E,145500,148200,became a political cartoonist and during
3WSk86uIx2E,148200,151019,World War Two produced over 400 cartoons
3WSk86uIx2E,151019,153150,the funny thing about these drawings is
3WSk86uIx2E,153150,155190,that many of them contain creatures and
3WSk86uIx2E,155190,157260,caricatures that are very familiar to
3WSk86uIx2E,157260,159120,the wacky animals later seen in his
3WSk86uIx2E,159120,161370,children's books so it gets very surreal
3WSk86uIx2E,161370,163260,when you see something like horton
3WSk86uIx2E,163260,165900,representing the GOP and adolf hitler
3WSk86uIx2E,165900,168090,drawn in his signature whimsical style
3WSk86uIx2E,168090,170609,but just to be absolutely clear dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,170609,172739,Seuss was very opposed to fascism and
3WSk86uIx2E,172739,174810,American isolationism during World War
3WSk86uIx2E,174810,176790,two but he wasn't always on the right
3WSk86uIx2E,176790,178709,side of history especially when you
3WSk86uIx2E,178709,182819,highlight these two comics Oh ooh these
3WSk86uIx2E,182819,185940,are these are spicy these are very spicy
3WSk86uIx2E,185940,188609,of course you have to keep in mind the
3WSk86uIx2E,188609,190440,time period when these depictions were
3WSk86uIx2E,190440,192840,acceptable and yes he did support the
3WSk86uIx2E,192840,194790,Japanese internment camps at the time
3WSk86uIx2E,194790,197489,but clearly his ideas changed quite a
3WSk86uIx2E,197489,199859,bit later on these political cartoons
3WSk86uIx2E,199859,202199,while interesting are not as polished or
3WSk86uIx2E,202199,203819,witty as the children's books he would
3WSk86uIx2E,203819,206280,later write dr. Seuss's art style has
3WSk86uIx2E,206280,207810,remained very consistent throughout
3WSk86uIx2E,207810,209940,pretty much all of his career to
3WSk86uIx2E,209940,211709,demonstrate this you can take a quick
3WSk86uIx2E,211709,213629,glance at any of the advertisements that
3WSk86uIx2E,213629,215730,he Illustrated and immediately recognize
3WSk86uIx2E,215730,218160,his signature style anything from Ford
3WSk86uIx2E,218160,220949,to Standard Oil to a detailed drawing of
3WSk86uIx2E,220949,222720,hell for General Electric
3WSk86uIx2E,222720,224790,I cannot understate how unique and
3WSk86uIx2E,224790,227010,recognizable Ted geysell's art style was
3WSk86uIx2E,227010,229560,his figures are simple yet complicated
3WSk86uIx2E,229560,232889,plain and rounded droopy faces contrast
3WSk86uIx2E,232889,234959,with intricate cross hatching on things
3WSk86uIx2E,234959,237060,like clothes and fur his characters are
3WSk86uIx2E,237060,239310,very gestural and lively and his
3WSk86uIx2E,239310,241319,buildings and machinery are no different
3WSk86uIx2E,241319,243480,they often seem to defy gravity and
3WSk86uIx2E,243480,246180,rarely contain any straight lines the
3WSk86uIx2E,246180,248220,use of cross hatching and reliance on
3WSk86uIx2E,248220,250169,pen and ink along with the strategic
3WSk86uIx2E,250169,252569,flat colors seen in most of his books
3WSk86uIx2E,252569,254879,probably comes from his experience as a
3WSk86uIx2E,254879,257010,cartoonist with the goal of keeping the
3WSk86uIx2E,257010,259019,interest of younger audiences and
3WSk86uIx2E,259019,261209,combined with the ridiculous designs of
3WSk86uIx2E,261209,263490,his creatures and machines they all form
3WSk86uIx2E,263490,265770,an identity that is overwhelmingly and
3WSk86uIx2E,265770,267720,undeniably Seussian
3WSk86uIx2E,267720,270300,the rhymes inventive made-up words and
3WSk86uIx2E,270300,272040,timeless storytelling are the core of
3WSk86uIx2E,272040,273360,his children's books
3WSk86uIx2E,273360,275250,the imagery he uses to bring that
3WSk86uIx2E,275250,277500,whimsical poetry into visual forms is
3WSk86uIx2E,277500,279540,essential to the experience of a dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,279540,281520,Seuss work and what makes this style
3WSk86uIx2E,281520,283200,more intriguing is when it's put into
3WSk86uIx2E,283200,285330,different situations from political
3WSk86uIx2E,285330,287580,cartoons to taxidermy but there is
3WSk86uIx2E,287580,289590,another collection of lesser-known dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,289590,290940,Seuss art that I find the most
3WSk86uIx2E,290940,293040,interesting of them all dozens of
3WSk86uIx2E,293040,294900,paintings that dr. Seuss made in private
3WSk86uIx2E,294900,296910,and were not to be released until after
3WSk86uIx2E,296910,299400,his death a collection he liked to call
3WSk86uIx2E,299400,304950,the midnight paintings what strikes most
3WSk86uIx2E,304950,306900,people first about these paintings is
3WSk86uIx2E,306900,308310,how different they are from his
3WSk86uIx2E,308310,310140,mainstream works there's a lot more
3WSk86uIx2E,310140,312330,black in other colors in these works and
3WSk86uIx2E,312330,314010,many of them have a more ethereal
3WSk86uIx2E,314010,316350,quality clearly these paintings were
3WSk86uIx2E,316350,318390,made for more emotive and leisure goals
3WSk86uIx2E,318390,320910,rather than storytelling ones it's hard
3WSk86uIx2E,320910,322740,to summarize the many paintings he
3WSk86uIx2E,322740,324810,produced behind closed doors so it's
3WSk86uIx2E,324810,326160,really best to approach them
3WSk86uIx2E,326160,329220,case-by-case the secret dr. Seuss works
3WSk86uIx2E,329220,331470,have a variety of styles and subjects
3WSk86uIx2E,331470,333960,this painting titled cat detective in
3WSk86uIx2E,333960,336180,the wrong part of town is reminiscent of
3WSk86uIx2E,336180,338520,Kubis works but with brighter colors and
3WSk86uIx2E,338520,340620,typical Seussian architecture a few
3WSk86uIx2E,340620,342690,other paintings contain a similar style
3WSk86uIx2E,342690,345240,but for subjects like resorts others are
3WSk86uIx2E,345240,347400,more dramatic forcing the viewer into
3WSk86uIx2E,347400,349530,unorthodox perspectives like this Dutch
3WSk86uIx2E,349530,351840,angle view of blobs of color leaping out
3WSk86uIx2E,351840,353790,of a brightly colored ocean or this
3WSk86uIx2E,353790,355740,drastically curved landscape that seems
3WSk86uIx2E,355740,358770,to extend for infinity some are entirely
3WSk86uIx2E,358770,361290,abstract others are more pattern based
3WSk86uIx2E,361290,363419,like this painting of dozens of
3WSk86uIx2E,363419,365400,working-class Birds walking up and down
3WSk86uIx2E,365400,367770,made to express geysell's economic
3WSk86uIx2E,367770,370169,concerns then this painting a plethora
3WSk86uIx2E,370169,373740,of cats was made for a simple reason to
3WSk86uIx2E,373740,376200,show a lot of cats but more specifically
3WSk86uIx2E,376200,378660,as a form of relaxation to see how many
3WSk86uIx2E,378660,380880,cats he could paint in and how many are
3WSk86uIx2E,380880,385110,on this one canvas exactly 392 a more
3WSk86uIx2E,385110,386910,satirical set of works called the la
3WSk86uIx2E,386910,389130,jolla bird women resulted from Geisel
3WSk86uIx2E,389130,390960,people watching from his La Jolla tower
3WSk86uIx2E,390960,393810,studio these thin bird folk were made to
3WSk86uIx2E,393810,396060,gently poke fun at his neighbors and as
3WSk86uIx2E,396060,396810,you would expect
3WSk86uIx2E,396810,399450,they are quite simple they're women but
3WSk86uIx2E,399450,401520,birds the works I think are most
3WSk86uIx2E,401520,403289,interesting are the ones that are darker
3WSk86uIx2E,403289,405539,both in color schemes and subject matter
3WSk86uIx2E,405539,408300,a very simple painting titled cat in
3WSk86uIx2E,408300,409440,obsolete shower-bath
3WSk86uIx2E,409440,411389,demonstrates the purely aesthetic
3WSk86uIx2E,411389,413460,choices of the darker paintings the
3WSk86uIx2E,413460,415379,brushstrokes and layering of color is
3WSk86uIx2E,415379,417810,erratic there's no flat or smooth colors
3WSk86uIx2E,417810,420629,just textural grungy spots forming the
3WSk86uIx2E,420629,422610,environment the greenish yellow of the
3WSk86uIx2E,422610,424620,shower curtain is reminiscent of mold
3WSk86uIx2E,424620,426629,there is speculation this is meant to
3WSk86uIx2E,426629,428610,represent how early in his life Ted
3WSk86uIx2E,428610,430409,Geisel had to spend time in dingy
3WSk86uIx2E,430409,431940,one-room apartments
3WSk86uIx2E,431940,433949,these overlapping gradients and textural
3WSk86uIx2E,433949,435930,painting is a far cry from the clean
3WSk86uIx2E,435930,437970,calculated coloring of his children's
3WSk86uIx2E,437970,439949,books and many of these paintings seem
3WSk86uIx2E,439949,442470,to represent a seer almost cynical
3WSk86uIx2E,442470,444659,aspect we didn't usually see in his art
3WSk86uIx2E,444659,446940,one of my favorite paintings cat from
3WSk86uIx2E,446940,448949,the wrong side of the tracks seems to
3WSk86uIx2E,448949,451169,imply just from the title the subject is
3WSk86uIx2E,451169,453150,an inversion of the child-friendly cat
3WSk86uIx2E,453150,455520,in the hat' the face is more angular his
3WSk86uIx2E,455520,458430,whiskers unkempt and his aura is overall
3WSk86uIx2E,458430,460800,more sinister to complement this we get
3WSk86uIx2E,460800,462539,more sushi in architecture but applied
3WSk86uIx2E,462539,464460,to a pool table with a bunch of nonsense
3WSk86uIx2E,464460,466650,angles and extreme Distortion
3WSk86uIx2E,466650,468539,one of my favorite details is the beads
3WSk86uIx2E,468539,470610,above his head everyone knows the saying
3WSk86uIx2E,470610,473219,a cat has nine lives right well let's
3WSk86uIx2E,473219,474840,just say that it seems eight of his
3WSk86uIx2E,474840,477150,beads are used up and there seems to be
3WSk86uIx2E,477150,478620,just one left
3WSk86uIx2E,478620,481110,a similar painting indistinct cat with
3WSk86uIx2E,481110,483599,cigar develops a theory that these cat
3WSk86uIx2E,483599,485580,representations could be something of an
3WSk86uIx2E,485580,486389,alter-ego
3WSk86uIx2E,486389,488460,considering that dr. Seuss was a
3WSk86uIx2E,488460,490409,lifelong smoker and just like how we
3WSk86uIx2E,490409,492659,never smoked where a child might see him
3WSk86uIx2E,492659,494880,these paintings too remained hidden it's
3WSk86uIx2E,494880,496800,hard to find any self-portraits of his
3WSk86uIx2E,496800,498990,that are positive or Pleasant one of
3WSk86uIx2E,498990,500599,them is quite blatantly titled
3WSk86uIx2E,500599,502800,self-portrait of the artist worrying
3WSk86uIx2E,502800,504870,about his next book so it seems to me
3WSk86uIx2E,504870,506610,some of these works might have been dr.
3WSk86uIx2E,506610,509639,Seuss's version of vent art well that's
3WSk86uIx2E,509639,511979,probably an oversimplification but you
3WSk86uIx2E,511979,512789,get what I mean
3WSk86uIx2E,512789,514770,probably one of the creepiest darker
3WSk86uIx2E,514770,517169,paintings is surly cat being ejected
3WSk86uIx2E,517169,519599,where this grotesquely long cat is being
3WSk86uIx2E,519599,521940,sent away by this almost faceless
3WSk86uIx2E,521940,524159,mannequin like woman in the dead of
3WSk86uIx2E,524159,526560,night it's hard to pinpoint exactly why
3WSk86uIx2E,526560,529200,I find this work slightly unsettling but
3WSk86uIx2E,529200,530880,I would guess it's the combination of
3WSk86uIx2E,530880,533040,all the uncanny and distorted elements
3WSk86uIx2E,533040,535230,of course in contrast there are many ho
3WSk86uIx2E,535230,537240,full and bright paintings such as this
3WSk86uIx2E,537240,539790,sunny seascape full of roaring waves and
3WSk86uIx2E,539790,541980,the impossibly long tail of a bird being
3WSk86uIx2E,541980,544020,manipulated by the great swirls and
3WSk86uIx2E,544020,546480,fluctuations of the wind the dynamic
3WSk86uIx2E,546480,548370,shapes that Geisel so masterfully
3WSk86uIx2E,548370,550410,produces gives this painting a great
3WSk86uIx2E,550410,552690,sense of energy and movement then there
3WSk86uIx2E,552690,554460,are paintings that walk a delicate
3WSk86uIx2E,554460,556620,middle ground between melancholy and
3WSk86uIx2E,556620,558960,hopefulness such as the great cat
3WSk86uIx2E,558960,561110,continuum made during his later years
3WSk86uIx2E,561110,563910,dr. Seuss's cat seems to walk through an
3WSk86uIx2E,563910,565860,enormous line of windows from one
3WSk86uIx2E,565860,567930,experience to the next each with
3WSk86uIx2E,567930,569340,slightly different shapes and
3WSk86uIx2E,569340,571290,distortions there are a few with
3WSk86uIx2E,571290,573240,biblical meanings such as this depiction
3WSk86uIx2E,573240,575670,of the Tower of Babel or this cat named
3WSk86uIx2E,575670,577800,Joseph cats sporting a brightly colored
3WSk86uIx2E,577800,580410,outfit clearly alluding to the story of
3WSk86uIx2E,580410,582360,Joseph and his brothers but the ones
3WSk86uIx2E,582360,584340,that are my favorite come from a stage
3WSk86uIx2E,584340,586410,in the midnight paintings often referred
3WSk86uIx2E,586410,589380,to as sky Souls Deco period referring to
3WSk86uIx2E,589380,590940,the black backgrounds in golden
3WSk86uIx2E,590940,593240,structures the iconic and strange
3WSk86uIx2E,593240,595350,asymmetrical slightly organic
3WSk86uIx2E,595350,598200,architecture is illogical almost alien
3WSk86uIx2E,598200,600870,even more so than in his books because
3WSk86uIx2E,600870,603000,this time there is few basic structures
3WSk86uIx2E,603000,605100,to even signify something inhabitable
3WSk86uIx2E,605100,607770,not even a window or roof the only thing
3WSk86uIx2E,607770,609480,that is an indicator are the stairs
3WSk86uIx2E,609480,612090,stairs that seem to lead nowhere and
3WSk86uIx2E,612090,614100,when you have this architecture set in
3WSk86uIx2E,614100,616260,front of an almost pure black background
3WSk86uIx2E,616260,618510,both with a single creature resting in
3WSk86uIx2E,618510,620490,the middle you get this immense sense of
3WSk86uIx2E,620490,623250,isolation abandonment even it is
3WSk86uIx2E,623250,624960,difficult to assume that the people who
3WSk86uIx2E,624960,626610,built these structures are even living
3WSk86uIx2E,626610,628230,there anymore but the creatures
3WSk86uIx2E,628230,629850,currently relaxing in these structures
3WSk86uIx2E,629850,632460,are happy they are a beacon of life and
3WSk86uIx2E,632460,634500,hope and that's why with this sense of
3WSk86uIx2E,634500,636690,isolation you also get this immense
3WSk86uIx2E,636690,638760,sense of tranquility other deco
3WSk86uIx2E,638760,640920,paintings give off similar feelings but
3WSk86uIx2E,640920,643080,not as intensely as these two when I
3WSk86uIx2E,643080,645060,first heard about these secret paintings
3WSk86uIx2E,645060,646980,I wanted to find some sort of code to
3WSk86uIx2E,646980,649170,crack some puzzle or hidden meaning
3WSk86uIx2E,649170,650850,behind these private works that could
3WSk86uIx2E,650850,652920,possibly unlock some of dr. Seuss's
3WSk86uIx2E,652920,655740,genius or give some magical window into
3WSk86uIx2E,655740,658440,the man's soul or reveal some deep dark
3WSk86uIx2E,658440,661230,secret but of course these paintings are
3WSk86uIx2E,661230,663720,a variety of things none of them really
3WSk86uIx2E,663720,666150,gossip worthy and while they do reveal
3WSk86uIx2E,666150,668070,some sides to Ted Geisel that were
3WSk86uIx2E,668070,669120,previously on
3WSk86uIx2E,669120,672420,they're also fun humorous and Express
3WSk86uIx2E,672420,674699,his imagination just as well as in his
3WSk86uIx2E,674699,677100,books but with more coloring and subject
3WSk86uIx2E,677100,679259,matter freedom the many atmospheres and
3WSk86uIx2E,679259,680759,moods expressed in the midnight
3WSk86uIx2E,680759,682649,paintings are often different from his
3WSk86uIx2E,682649,684509,books but I can say with utmost
3WSk86uIx2E,684509,689029,confidence they are just as creative
3WSk86uIx2E,690210,696180,[Music]
3WSk86uIx2E,696180,698240,you
3WSk86uIx2E,701990,705190,[Music]
3WSk86uIx2E,709089,711430,you're not just wrong you're stupid now
3WSk86uIx2E,711430,714540,wait just a minute
