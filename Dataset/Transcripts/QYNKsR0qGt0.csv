QYNKsR0qGt0,0,1360,once you get to the very very later
QYNKsR0qGt0,1360,3280,parts of the game interesting uh there's
QYNKsR0qGt0,3280,4799,an awe so i guess we're playing
QYNKsR0qGt0,4799,7759,ornaments or mint yup looks that way
QYNKsR0qGt0,7759,10639,or it's tom kinchemid
QYNKsR0qGt0,10639,12000,i
QYNKsR0qGt0,12000,13679,i think the oran mid here we've seen it
QYNKsR0qGt0,13679,15599,a few times and you can
QYNKsR0qGt0,15599,17359,weather the storm against the
QYNKsR0qGt0,17359,19600,amount of azir poke but like
QYNKsR0qGt0,19600,23119,pryo will be nowhere for hwang dong okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,23119,25519,let's go to again very long time
QYNKsR0qGt0,25519,27359,we don't we go in minute one let's do it
QYNKsR0qGt0,27359,30359,now
QYNKsR0qGt0,31570,34880,[Applause]
QYNKsR0qGt0,35050,38140,[Music]
QYNKsR0qGt0,38960,41280,oh
QYNKsR0qGt0,41920,44160,the difference in fan chant definitely
QYNKsR0qGt0,44160,46239,uh quite pronounced
QYNKsR0qGt0,46239,48879,as always as i did say that we go in at
QYNKsR0qGt0,48879,50719,minute one i mean i guess technically
QYNKsR0qGt0,50719,53199,it's minute zero or minute oh like
QYNKsR0qGt0,53199,55520,second forty okay but the first minute
QYNKsR0qGt0,55520,57360,of league of legends starts at zero
QYNKsR0qGt0,57360,58320,right so i think you're still
QYNKsR0qGt0,58320,59920,technically hey there we go it's like
QYNKsR0qGt0,59920,62160,the korean birthday rule yeah everyone
QYNKsR0qGt0,62160,63680,starts at one
QYNKsR0qGt0,63680,67040,yeah as fate's like what what is this
QYNKsR0qGt0,67040,68720,i like elderwood on though so i think he
QYNKsR0qGt0,68720,70560,started off on the right foot okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,70560,72320,nobody's hurt each other pre one minute
QYNKsR0qGt0,72320,73920,either so you've got that you got that
QYNKsR0qGt0,73920,77360,going for you too yes yeah your court
QYNKsR0qGt0,77360,79600,um
QYNKsR0qGt0,80080,82320,quang dong have really priced themselves
QYNKsR0qGt0,82320,84840,into a draft where they're going to have
QYNKsR0qGt0,84840,87600,to play pretty passively
QYNKsR0qGt0,87600,90079,and not lose like all of their turrets
QYNKsR0qGt0,90079,92000,by 20 minutes which happens when you
QYNKsR0qGt0,92000,95280,face t1 which is why i think
QYNKsR0qGt0,95280,96000,of
QYNKsR0qGt0,96000,98159,strengths here for these two teams
QYNKsR0qGt0,98159,100000,interesting okay keen stripe he's the
QYNKsR0qGt0,100000,101280,best player on this team and then it's
QYNKsR0qGt0,101280,102880,also against as the best player actually
QYNKsR0qGt0,102880,104479,in the top lane this season and then
QYNKsR0qGt0,104479,106240,you've also drafted to like i hope they
QYNKsR0qGt0,106240,108399,don't get ahead early it's like ooh i'm
QYNKsR0qGt0,108399,109759,looking at these address and i'm feeling
QYNKsR0qGt0,109759,112079,like your chances of uh being even at
QYNKsR0qGt0,112079,113600,20.
QYNKsR0qGt0,113600,115600,very small but yeah let's wait and see
QYNKsR0qGt0,115600,118240,how it works out in practice but i don't
QYNKsR0qGt0,118240,120399,think guangdong has dealt themselves
QYNKsR0qGt0,120399,123200,a strong hand here
QYNKsR0qGt0,123200,125759,right now uh carrier gonna find some ebb
QYNKsR0qGt0,125759,126880,and flow
QYNKsR0qGt0,126880,129039,uh towards quantum freak's bottom lane
QYNKsR0qGt0,129039,131360,and yeah t1 with control of the wave a
QYNKsR0qGt0,131360,132800,little bit more wavelet look at the mid
QYNKsR0qGt0,132800,136400,lane by the way already like i mean yes
QYNKsR0qGt0,136400,137599,it's not looking good you know that's
QYNKsR0qGt0,137599,139360,how it goes in the early parts
QYNKsR0qGt0,139360,142160,i mean i will say you can bellows breath
QYNKsR0qGt0,142160,143680,through the emperor's divide if you time
QYNKsR0qGt0,143680,144800,it correctly
QYNKsR0qGt0,144800,146720,so that's pretty cool
QYNKsR0qGt0,146720,148239,um
QYNKsR0qGt0,148239,150000,whether that's relevant because of the
QYNKsR0qGt0,150000,152319,fact that faker can set up sand soldiers
QYNKsR0qGt0,152319,153920,and just
QYNKsR0qGt0,153920,155680,destroy everyone there's a little bit of
QYNKsR0qGt0,155680,157200,a worry remember this game i remember
QYNKsR0qGt0,157200,158000,this game this was the game where they
QYNKsR0qGt0,158000,160319,built like all 80s right and like didn't
QYNKsR0qGt0,160319,163040,have any magic damage i want to say yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,163040,164720,this was a strength this was like where
QYNKsR0qGt0,164720,167519,the on was like this is my counterpiece
QYNKsR0qGt0,167519,170319,and it didn't really work as a faker
QYNKsR0qGt0,170319,172400,just gonna have to watch as his x team
QYNKsR0qGt0,172400,174480,big ball spy casually but knows where
QYNKsR0qGt0,174480,176800,faker was in lane at that moment they
QYNKsR0qGt0,176800,178400,have a ward down to the bottom part of
QYNKsR0qGt0,178400,180239,that lane too to spot out a rotation
QYNKsR0qGt0,180239,182239,like this and now because they know the
QYNKsR0qGt0,182239,183920,path timing there's actually a little
QYNKsR0qGt0,183920,186080,bit of potential here for owner to do
QYNKsR0qGt0,186080,187680,some shenanigans because faker has that
QYNKsR0qGt0,187680,189360,prio and this is the power of early
QYNKsR0qGt0,189360,190879,leads especially when you give prior on
QYNKsR0qGt0,190879,192080,blue side
QYNKsR0qGt0,192080,194000,you have so much potential as the enemy
QYNKsR0qGt0,194000,195680,junglers he's gonna look for it
QYNKsR0qGt0,195680,197280,yeah he's gonna get in there audacious
QYNKsR0qGt0,197280,199120,charge goes down wind becomes lightning
QYNKsR0qGt0,199120,201040,not going to connect thanks for watching
QYNKsR0qGt0,201040,204319,the big wraith did go over to ellen but
QYNKsR0qGt0,204319,207760,now tijuana is going to three buff d1 is
QYNKsR0qGt0,207760,209760,so dominating
QYNKsR0qGt0,209760,212080,lm gonna rap all the way around as you
QYNKsR0qGt0,212080,213920,can see and t1 with so much control here
QYNKsR0qGt0,213920,215040,towards the bottom side as well i mean
QYNKsR0qGt0,215040,216720,this is what we're expecting this is
QYNKsR0qGt0,216720,219120,what should be happening right now
QYNKsR0qGt0,219120,221280,but uh the quantum freaks they just need
QYNKsR0qGt0,221280,223680,to do their very best to hold on
QYNKsR0qGt0,223680,225920,right now it's already starting to look
QYNKsR0qGt0,225920,227040,rough
QYNKsR0qGt0,227040,228159,yeah i mean we haven't passed the point
QYNKsR0qGt0,228159,229920,in the return or anything that is yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,229920,231920,just to point out he's got like one loss
QYNKsR0qGt0,231920,233040,on lee sin
QYNKsR0qGt0,233040,235680,and uh one loss on the asian child
QYNKsR0qGt0,235680,237760,is being pretty good yeah he's um you
QYNKsR0qGt0,237760,240480,know when you keep winning all the time
QYNKsR0qGt0,240480,242159,those win rates for every champion that
QYNKsR0qGt0,242159,243200,you're playing especially the meadow
QYNKsR0qGt0,243200,246560,where it's like chinchou or lee sin
QYNKsR0qGt0,246560,248799,that's gonna get it's gonna get up there
QYNKsR0qGt0,248799,251280,well alan's decided that uh jungling is
QYNKsR0qGt0,251280,252400,not for him
QYNKsR0qGt0,252400,255280,and zeus has decided that uh he kind of
QYNKsR0qGt0,255280,256320,knew
QYNKsR0qGt0,256320,258160,as that ward is going to give zeus all
QYNKsR0qGt0,258160,260880,the information that he ever wanted
QYNKsR0qGt0,260880,263199,and so now ellen's going to soak some
QYNKsR0qGt0,263199,265440,experience
QYNKsR0qGt0,265440,267520,but otherwise this is a counter gank
QYNKsR0qGt0,267520,269440,that could go absolutely absolutely
QYNKsR0qGt0,269440,271600,wrong yeah freaks ellen doesn't know
QYNKsR0qGt0,271600,273759,he's been spotted yeah even the cannon
QYNKsR0qGt0,273759,276880,goes wide as owner charging up the
QYNKsR0qGt0,276880,278960,knockoff as they flash on in they are
QYNKsR0qGt0,278960,281840,going for keen nice
QYNKsR0qGt0,281840,283919,trying to run away
QYNKsR0qGt0,283919,287520,oh dear t1 just knew exactly what was
QYNKsR0qGt0,287520,289759,going on zeus is just holding his finger
QYNKsR0qGt0,289759,291440,over the flash key
QYNKsR0qGt0,291440,292960,or rather owner is holding his finger
QYNKsR0qGt0,292960,294400,over the flash key knowing that elem is
QYNKsR0qGt0,294400,295680,there knowing because he was spot on a
QYNKsR0qGt0,295680,298080,war this w stun is coming
QYNKsR0qGt0,298080,299600,and they almost turn this into a kill
QYNKsR0qGt0,299600,302560,it's two flashes here for a ghost
QYNKsR0qGt0,302560,304800,as uh at least the knock-up hits
QYNKsR0qGt0,304800,306639,yeah face actually popping some brittle
QYNKsR0qGt0,306639,307919,here
QYNKsR0qGt0,307919,309440,nicely done
QYNKsR0qGt0,309440,312320,but the thing about this is t1 are one
QYNKsR0qGt0,312320,314160,step ahead they predict this rotation
QYNKsR0qGt0,314160,316400,because they've given elem no options
QYNKsR0qGt0,316400,317919,and this draft puts element a place
QYNKsR0qGt0,317919,320160,where with no prio he has to make these
QYNKsR0qGt0,320160,321919,tough decisions and a player like elm
QYNKsR0qGt0,321919,323120,hasn't always been known for his
QYNKsR0qGt0,323120,326240,decisiveness but watch this flash setup
QYNKsR0qGt0,326240,330240,just waits for it waits for it boom
QYNKsR0qGt0,330800,332720,it's on top of keen first to get the
QYNKsR0qGt0,332720,333680,kill
QYNKsR0qGt0,333680,336800,two flashes for a ghost he just read
QYNKsR0qGt0,336800,338320,that completely and it's all to do with
QYNKsR0qGt0,338320,340320,that waters let's have a look at this
QYNKsR0qGt0,340320,342560,dude
QYNKsR0qGt0,344240,345919,okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,345919,348639,okay okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,350620,353919,[Applause]
QYNKsR0qGt0,353919,356639,he's like my cooldowns are too long so
QYNKsR0qGt0,356639,358080,it's like too bad it basically was like
QYNKsR0qGt0,358080,359759,oh unlucky we couldn't get two kills
QYNKsR0qGt0,359759,362400,there this was what he said essentially
QYNKsR0qGt0,362400,364880,uh and
QYNKsR0qGt0,364880,367280,yeah i mean it was already going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,367280,369199,rough but after that it's going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,369199,372319,even worse for the quantum priests
QYNKsR0qGt0,372319,374479,a t1 currently just cruising
QYNKsR0qGt0,374479,376400,and it's not to say like we're talking
QYNKsR0qGt0,376400,378160,about this like quantum freaks are just
QYNKsR0qGt0,378160,380080,going to win if things get uh to late
QYNKsR0qGt0,380080,382240,game no i mean the scaling on t one side
QYNKsR0qGt0,382240,383680,is also great
QYNKsR0qGt0,383680,385520,um it's just no we're doing it again the
QYNKsR0qGt0,385520,387759,same as quantum freaks as uh yeah owners
QYNKsR0qGt0,387759,389520,thinking about a dive or maybe thinking
QYNKsR0qGt0,389520,391120,about just uh taking away ellen's camera
QYNKsR0qGt0,391120,393360,yes no it's dive time
QYNKsR0qGt0,393360,395280,as isaias he does and they're just
QYNKsR0qGt0,395280,397039,looking to plate ganks there's the knock
QYNKsR0qGt0,397039,398479,up as ellen's trying to do what he can
QYNKsR0qGt0,398479,400639,because
QYNKsR0qGt0,400960,402880,up here t1 will take away the rest of
QYNKsR0qGt0,402880,404319,these minions and
QYNKsR0qGt0,404319,406400,goodness
QYNKsR0qGt0,406400,409039,and then
QYNKsR0qGt0,411840,413520,oh no
QYNKsR0qGt0,413520,415360,it turns out there is no weak side for
QYNKsR0qGt0,415360,416479,t1
QYNKsR0qGt0,416479,419039,in this game there is no excite doesn't
QYNKsR0qGt0,419039,421440,exist it's just three strong sides
QYNKsR0qGt0,421440,424400,there's a third side atlas yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,424400,426080,those losing plates and bottom losing
QYNKsR0qGt0,426080,428800,plates on top and i'm learning about new
QYNKsR0qGt0,428800,431599,dimensions here thank you so much uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,431599,434560,just so many sides to this one
QYNKsR0qGt0,434560,436400,uh issue just
QYNKsR0qGt0,436400,438400,grabs a plate towards that bottom side
QYNKsR0qGt0,438400,439919,there is uh teddy picking up his
QYNKsR0qGt0,439919,441360,swifties
QYNKsR0qGt0,441360,443440,as fate's eating some honey fruit and
QYNKsR0qGt0,443440,445520,faker is just
QYNKsR0qGt0,445520,448160,shoving this wave relentlessly because
QYNKsR0qGt0,448160,450080,it's just so hard to put on any pressure
QYNKsR0qGt0,450080,452080,yeah uh when it's uh when these are the
QYNKsR0qGt0,452080,453599,lanes that you are dealt
QYNKsR0qGt0,453599,455759,so six is up here for zeus and like it
QYNKsR0qGt0,455759,457280,could have been a plate gank but keen is
QYNKsR0qGt0,457280,459360,like so nervous he steps away from the
QYNKsR0qGt0,459360,460800,turret here and then they're like i mean
QYNKsR0qGt0,460800,462639,there's such a huge wave it's just too
QYNKsR0qGt0,462639,464000,too good of an opportunity to pass off
QYNKsR0qGt0,464000,464960,and they're like all right we'll get
QYNKsR0qGt0,464960,468720,everything here plates deny cs 20 cs the
QYNKsR0qGt0,468720,471759,leader now isaias yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,471759,473039,and i mean this matchup doesn't get
QYNKsR0qGt0,473039,474960,easier for a long time
QYNKsR0qGt0,474960,477039,kane does make it to level six so there
QYNKsR0qGt0,477039,479199,is at least that it's going to be harder
QYNKsR0qGt0,479199,481199,to dive in but
QYNKsR0qGt0,481199,483680,i still think that uh yeah given what
QYNKsR0qGt0,483680,486479,this looks like it's so incredibly
QYNKsR0qGt0,486479,488560,difficult for kane to even get towards
QYNKsR0qGt0,488560,490639,these minions and that's what happens
QYNKsR0qGt0,490639,491840,when you lose two flashes in the
QYNKsR0qGt0,491840,493360,previous attempt as well like yeah they
QYNKsR0qGt0,493360,495199,didn't get double kills unlucky but
QYNKsR0qGt0,495199,496960,owner's back he's like i know you don't
QYNKsR0qGt0,496960,498479,have to splash i know we could pull this
QYNKsR0qGt0,498479,499919,off you don't even have that one second
QYNKsR0qGt0,499919,501759,to buy with flash
QYNKsR0qGt0,501759,503360,as rift herald here
QYNKsR0qGt0,503360,505599,the setup is
QYNKsR0qGt0,505599,507440,i mean they're they're hard pushing for
QYNKsR0qGt0,507440,509440,it among them freaks do be hard because
QYNKsR0qGt0,509440,510960,they know that if they lose this one the
QYNKsR0qGt0,510960,512719,game just really snowballs against them
QYNKsR0qGt0,512719,513839,but i don't know if this is a winning
QYNKsR0qGt0,513839,515760,fight lucian not here of course teleport
QYNKsR0qGt0,515760,517839,down yeah sweep his spots it out his
QYNKsR0qGt0,517839,520240,height is going to be bubbled
QYNKsR0qGt0,520240,522080,baker getting some shots on over
QYNKsR0qGt0,522080,525200,isaiah's up towards the top side
QYNKsR0qGt0,525200,527040,rotating in keene's going to get round
QYNKsR0qGt0,527040,528959,though five versus four for the moment
QYNKsR0qGt0,528959,530959,there's the on horn as fate dashes
QYNKsR0qGt0,530959,532160,forward they're looking for owner he
QYNKsR0qGt0,532160,533920,throws down the off but still manages to
QYNKsR0qGt0,533920,536160,die
QYNKsR0qGt0,536560,538640,through as the culling comes down as
QYNKsR0qGt0,538640,540720,well kumiyushi joining the fight keems
QYNKsR0qGt0,540720,542480,so incredibly low ellen gets his
QYNKsR0qGt0,542480,544640,ultimate and then the kale dies
QYNKsR0qGt0,544640,547040,unfortunately ellen trying to run this
QYNKsR0qGt0,547040,548480,one out though as they do manage to get
QYNKsR0qGt0,548480,551120,the reset onto zayus
QYNKsR0qGt0,551120,552720,as heartbreaker gets element out of
QYNKsR0qGt0,552720,554080,there gummy she may be stepping a little
QYNKsR0qGt0,554080,556320,bit too far forward gets knocked up on
QYNKsR0qGt0,556320,559519,it's just real good
QYNKsR0qGt0,559519,560880,available faker's gonna shift sands
QYNKsR0qGt0,560880,562160,sanskrit over the wall but he's the
QYNKsR0qGt0,562160,565360,wrong side of the rift and ellen is just
QYNKsR0qGt0,565360,567839,popping off in this fight teddy grabs
QYNKsR0qGt0,567839,570560,that kill and kwandong freaks they walk
QYNKsR0qGt0,570560,572480,away victorious they will i have the
QYNKsR0qGt0,572480,574160,herald goes over to hoyt he is able to
QYNKsR0qGt0,574160,576880,pick that one off so t1 fighting into a
QYNKsR0qGt0,576880,579279,choke point here without guma you see
QYNKsR0qGt0,579279,581200,really ends up fighting them in the back
QYNKsR0qGt0,581200,583440,because they're so hell bent on forcing
QYNKsR0qGt0,583440,584800,this one out
QYNKsR0qGt0,584800,586160,even though they have arguably the
QYNKsR0qGt0,586160,587200,better team fight here when you're
QYNKsR0qGt0,587200,588640,fighting into a choke like this you
QYNKsR0qGt0,588640,591120,don't actually and baker comes over here
QYNKsR0qGt0,591120,593360,and first divide he's decent but not
QYNKsR0qGt0,593360,595040,amazing and goomba's trying to do what
QYNKsR0qGt0,595040,596399,damage he can
QYNKsR0qGt0,596399,597760,but i mean
QYNKsR0qGt0,597760,599920,this is just unfortunately too difficult
QYNKsR0qGt0,599920,601519,to pull off at this stage without your
QYNKsR0qGt0,601519,603440,80 carry because the old comes down for
QYNKsR0qGt0,603440,606000,kale and they get out scot-free now t1 i
QYNKsR0qGt0,606000,607760,believe still has a pretty nice gold
QYNKsR0qGt0,607760,609519,lead after this
QYNKsR0qGt0,609519,611440,but bit of an over-extension here nice
QYNKsR0qGt0,611440,614800,turnaround by the catfish and crew and
QYNKsR0qGt0,614800,616640,yeah dawning shadow being held for that
QYNKsR0qGt0,616640,620240,long as well i think really baited uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,620240,621920,at that point in time because the amount
QYNKsR0qGt0,621920,622720,of
QYNKsR0qGt0,622720,625519,extra survivability that uh kwandong
QYNKsR0qGt0,625519,627519,freaks just sort of had
QYNKsR0qGt0,627519,630640,on hand was very very high so now you
QYNKsR0qGt0,630640,633200,know kale still in trouble but picks up
QYNKsR0qGt0,633200,634959,three assists worth of gold you know
QYNKsR0qGt0,634959,636640,santa is one zero and three now a lot of
QYNKsR0qGt0,636640,638320,extra money for her
QYNKsR0qGt0,638320,639360,a lot of
QYNKsR0qGt0,639360,641279,you know advantages here for t1 still on
QYNKsR0qGt0,641279,643120,top side they can still try to dive but
QYNKsR0qGt0,643120,644800,it gets harder and harder you know the
QYNKsR0qGt0,644800,646399,more kills you give over
QYNKsR0qGt0,646399,647600,but there's at least four they're at
QYNKsR0qGt0,647600,649200,least forcing ellen to stay here and
QYNKsR0qGt0,649200,650399,they are going to be able to get their
QYNKsR0qGt0,650399,653200,plate advantage increased by this play
QYNKsR0qGt0,653200,655279,yeah owner moves up they know that ellen
QYNKsR0qGt0,655279,657200,is still there as well as keane doesn't
QYNKsR0qGt0,657200,658880,quite have his ultimate available again
QYNKsR0qGt0,658880,662079,just yet heartbreaker is up though
QYNKsR0qGt0,662079,663680,crescent garden need to work both there
QYNKsR0qGt0,663680,665200,as well swim becomes blinding is not
QYNKsR0qGt0,665200,666800,quite long enough
QYNKsR0qGt0,666800,667680,keane
QYNKsR0qGt0,667680,670000,does manage to regain some control of
QYNKsR0qGt0,670000,671120,the lane
QYNKsR0qGt0,671120,672160,yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,672160,673680,and owner was fishing there if he gets
QYNKsR0qGt0,673680,675760,into the right spot could actually push
QYNKsR0qGt0,675760,677920,keen away with the crescent guard and
QYNKsR0qGt0,677920,679680,then actually they take him out so
QYNKsR0qGt0,679680,680720,forcing them to play a little bit more
QYNKsR0qGt0,680720,683279,passively they do not secure that second
QYNKsR0qGt0,683279,684880,plate top side well defended here by
QYNKsR0qGt0,684880,687120,quantum freaks the santa angle though
QYNKsR0qGt0,687120,688560,becoming a lot more comfortable now for
QYNKsR0qGt0,688560,689760,teddy is he's picked up all that extra
QYNKsR0qGt0,689760,691040,gold he's starting to get a few stacks
QYNKsR0qGt0,691040,692640,under his belt and the sustain that he
QYNKsR0qGt0,692640,693920,has here in lane is going to make it so
QYNKsR0qGt0,693920,696160,that he can actually aggressively trade
QYNKsR0qGt0,696160,698800,yeah and nami you know her ultimate
QYNKsR0qGt0,698800,700399,may have to even be used defensively in
QYNKsR0qGt0,700399,701760,some of these scenarios and upcoming
QYNKsR0qGt0,701760,706480,fights if uh the prio isn't there
QYNKsR0qGt0,709360,710959,taking a bit of damage conquering sans
QYNKsR0qGt0,710959,713279,as well as some of these autos
QYNKsR0qGt0,713279,715040,doing a fair bit of work communication
QYNKsR0qGt0,715040,716480,teleports back to this lane though has
QYNKsR0qGt0,716480,718000,his gale force available as the bubble
QYNKsR0qGt0,718000,719680,goes wide unless he was aiming for the
QYNKsR0qGt0,719680,721760,minions in which case absolutely fine
QYNKsR0qGt0,721760,723680,not quite long enough on that snare as
QYNKsR0qGt0,723680,726079,keem picks up berserker's greaves
QYNKsR0qGt0,726079,727760,and he'll uh teleport back towards that
QYNKsR0qGt0,727760,730079,top lane first drake at 12 minutes here
QYNKsR0qGt0,730079,732240,it looks like so with all that pressure
QYNKsR0qGt0,732240,734000,in the lane and t1 slack of interest in
QYNKsR0qGt0,734000,735519,getting a drake they just wanted to get
QYNKsR0qGt0,735519,736639,the gold lead like you were talking
QYNKsR0qGt0,736639,738320,about they aren't really big drake
QYNKsR0qGt0,738320,740240,focusers generally speaking yep they
QYNKsR0qGt0,740240,741680,didn't grab that with the prior they had
QYNKsR0qGt0,741680,744160,and now congo set their sights on it for
QYNKsR0qGt0,744160,746160,just a moment but will finally be pushed
QYNKsR0qGt0,746160,748720,away but it is a very slow start to the
QYNKsR0qGt0,748720,750959,drake counter this game
QYNKsR0qGt0,750959,752560,yeah they're going to move over here now
QYNKsR0qGt0,752560,753279,and
QYNKsR0qGt0,753279,755519,hoyt still hasn't used either herald it
QYNKsR0qGt0,755519,757680,is starting to wear off i'm a little bit
QYNKsR0qGt0,757680,759680,worried about the herald situation
QYNKsR0qGt0,759680,761120,because they are very far away from
QYNKsR0qGt0,761120,762399,enemy turrets
QYNKsR0qGt0,762399,765120,yeah that's the best drake
QYNKsR0qGt0,765120,766880,we'll lose place with the timing of this
QYNKsR0qGt0,766880,769360,so drake goes over the prior just never
QYNKsR0qGt0,769360,771120,ends man even with kuang dun freaks
QYNKsR0qGt0,771120,773519,taking a kill lead here the gold lead is
QYNKsR0qGt0,773519,776399,advantage tijuan the herald has
QYNKsR0qGt0,776399,779120,it's not great if you are in a lane to
QYNKsR0qGt0,779120,780079,drop a hero because you don't have any
QYNKsR0qGt0,780079,781920,prio in any of these three anyways but
QYNKsR0qGt0,781920,784240,he's like walking down the lane as this
QYNKsR0qGt0,784240,786399,is timing out we'll have to drop it now
QYNKsR0qGt0,786399,789200,yeah it drops it in the mid lane
QYNKsR0qGt0,789200,792079,and uh faker is teleporting back but you
QYNKsR0qGt0,792079,793519,can see quantum freaks are going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,793519,794800,able to get some control here so it
QYNKsR0qGt0,794800,797920,should be charged successful yeah it has
QYNKsR0qGt0,797920,800079,to be owners coming over to maybe punish
QYNKsR0qGt0,800079,801760,a straggler
QYNKsR0qGt0,801760,803120,but won't be able to do so the charge
QYNKsR0qGt0,803120,805760,will complete yep nicely done uh almost
QYNKsR0qGt0,805760,807440,able to get the next charge as well but
QYNKsR0qGt0,807440,808240,uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,808240,811360,surely shelly sorry will be dealt with
QYNKsR0qGt0,811360,812639,and keen's starting to trade back a
QYNKsR0qGt0,812639,814320,little bit better still kept that uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,814320,816320,gold advantage for zeus at about that
QYNKsR0qGt0,816320,818320,20cs mark which
QYNKsR0qGt0,818320,819920,you know is something to be expected
QYNKsR0qGt0,819920,821920,especially after all of the uh attention
QYNKsR0qGt0,821920,825199,that he got as zeus is uh yeah still
QYNKsR0qGt0,825199,827199,winning every single trade
QYNKsR0qGt0,827199,829360,yep man has his needle work he's holding
QYNKsR0qGt0,829360,831199,the stacked queue
QYNKsR0qGt0,831199,833360,and he's just gonna you know try to deny
QYNKsR0qGt0,833360,835920,as much experience and canon minions as
QYNKsR0qGt0,835920,837199,he can here and
QYNKsR0qGt0,837199,838639,now with a 30 cs advantage and every
QYNKsR0qGt0,838639,840480,time he has the ability to dash q he'll
QYNKsR0qGt0,840480,842639,take it oh yeah and
QYNKsR0qGt0,842639,843680,the leaching layer is going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,843680,845199,massive in this case as karia is
QYNKsR0qGt0,845199,847680,rotating up does have the ability to alt
QYNKsR0qGt0,847680,849680,gank here you know obviously then just
QYNKsR0qGt0,849680,852560,drop his ignite and walk away casually
QYNKsR0qGt0,852560,854560,so a lot of extra pressure and lucian's
QYNKsR0qGt0,854560,856160,happy to just lane against the tom ken i
QYNKsR0qGt0,856160,858879,don't think it's good
QYNKsR0qGt0,859440,861360,more stacks and you know be more
QYNKsR0qGt0,861360,862720,frustrating elsewhere this is kind of
QYNKsR0qGt0,862720,864880,the meta but you know this means you're
QYNKsR0qGt0,864880,866720,putting yourself in a catch lane things
QYNKsR0qGt0,866720,869040,can be very annoying at least for now
QYNKsR0qGt0,869040,870560,he does have his mythic available but
QYNKsR0qGt0,870560,873920,guma is happy to continue pressure
QYNKsR0qGt0,873920,876240,and pyromandic done here for carrier bit
QYNKsR0qGt0,876240,878959,of an aggressive choice i like it a lot
QYNKsR0qGt0,878959,880639,uh soldiers
QYNKsR0qGt0,880639,882639,just are manning the entryways to this
QYNKsR0qGt0,882639,884720,mid lane faker having just the greatest
QYNKsR0qGt0,884720,887199,of times right now on his asia
QYNKsR0qGt0,887199,888560,especially now that his league andres is
QYNKsR0qGt0,888560,891040,done yeah against an oran he's just like
QYNKsR0qGt0,891040,892560,every time i touch you you're feeling
QYNKsR0qGt0,892560,894880,terrible yeah the itemization this game
QYNKsR0qGt0,894880,896839,for nazir is not even
QYNKsR0qGt0,896839,898560,yeah it's like literally so easy this
QYNKsR0qGt0,898560,899519,time
QYNKsR0qGt0,899519,901040,uh spanking does have to shift some
QYNKsR0qGt0,901040,902880,sands to get away here ellen decent
QYNKsR0qGt0,902880,904160,little stun
QYNKsR0qGt0,904160,906320,but fake is still just going to be uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,906320,908959,healed back up by the nami
QYNKsR0qGt0,908959,912880,as ellen i think realized that his
QYNKsR0qGt0,912880,915519,rib up was stolen
QYNKsR0qGt0,915519,918079,gwen pushing top side here is keene
QYNKsR0qGt0,918079,919839,forced to come over and try to set up
QYNKsR0qGt0,919839,921600,for a fast take here but it's a santa
QYNKsR0qGt0,921600,924160,comp i try to rush this sound cool yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,924160,925920,i know t1 need to be careful about going
QYNKsR0qGt0,925920,927519,through that choke point maybe splitting
QYNKsR0qGt0,927519,928959,and wrapping around would be the better
QYNKsR0qGt0,928959,930079,option and that is what they're looking
QYNKsR0qGt0,930079,931680,for here clear that vision
QYNKsR0qGt0,931680,934320,yeah gwen flank is real for zeus here
QYNKsR0qGt0,934320,936480,there's the on horn though there's the
QYNKsR0qGt0,936480,938639,just dodges it though and fate's gonna
QYNKsR0qGt0,938639,940320,have to be devoured dance gets exhausted
QYNKsR0qGt0,940320,942000,as soon as he can cheers he comes on
QYNKsR0qGt0,942000,944079,through keane has an ultimate on himself
QYNKsR0qGt0,944079,945600,no one's died just yet but fate should
QYNKsR0qGt0,945600,947759,be the first and there he goes faker is
QYNKsR0qGt0,947759,950079,going to be given the kill and says
QYNKsR0qGt0,950079,951759,picks up one as well
QYNKsR0qGt0,951759,953680,if at first you don't succeed try again
QYNKsR0qGt0,953680,955519,just one more time and it'll be way
QYNKsR0qGt0,955519,958639,better the setup was really nice and
QYNKsR0qGt0,958639,960320,fate tries to
QYNKsR0qGt0,960320,962320,do a king in there and flash during the
QYNKsR0qGt0,962320,964240,ultimate but he's unable to catch the
QYNKsR0qGt0,964240,965920,dodging loose
QYNKsR0qGt0,965920,967440,that one so adeptly
QYNKsR0qGt0,967440,969839,you don't have the damage it's a sena
QYNKsR0qGt0,969839,971680,with an umbrella glaive
QYNKsR0qGt0,971680,973519,try trying to push this drake there or
QYNKsR0qGt0,973519,975440,whether this herald down you don't have
QYNKsR0qGt0,975440,977680,advantage here your kale is not even
QYNKsR0qGt0,977680,979199,level 11 yet
QYNKsR0qGt0,979199,980880,and so like
QYNKsR0qGt0,980880,982160,i don't know it's just a bad time and
QYNKsR0qGt0,982160,984000,it's a bad decision
QYNKsR0qGt0,984000,985360,but like what other choices are you
QYNKsR0qGt0,985360,986160,making you're just going to sit there
QYNKsR0qGt0,986160,987680,and lose your turn lose the rip turret
QYNKsR0qGt0,987680,988800,like you have to try to fight you have
QYNKsR0qGt0,988800,990399,to try to rush this down maybe look for
QYNKsR0qGt0,990399,992320,the turn fight with the ornhorn which is
QYNKsR0qGt0,992320,994240,exactly what fate tries to do
QYNKsR0qGt0,994240,997360,here and flashes for it fails it do
QYNKsR0qGt0,997360,998639,music gets away and then the fight is
QYNKsR0qGt0,998639,999759,over but we're just watching the
QYNKsR0qGt0,999759,1001440,fireworks here team's like i'm holding
QYNKsR0qGt0,1001440,1003040,myself guys sorry i'm going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,1003040,1004560,selfish here i don't want to lose

QYNKsR0qGt0,1006560,1008240,this fight are dunzo
QYNKsR0qGt0,1008240,1010320,and keenan ellen will fall down t1 pick
QYNKsR0qGt0,1010320,1012320,up the second herald yep keen ulting
QYNKsR0qGt0,1012320,1014800,himself and just trying to get away um
QYNKsR0qGt0,1014800,1017519,as as soon as that one horn did nothing
QYNKsR0qGt0,1017519,1020160,that was it that was it yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1020160,1021440,could have been so much more valuable
QYNKsR0qGt0,1021440,1024160,though it felt like fate was like this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1024160,1026079,is how all of the best players are made
QYNKsR0qGt0,1026079,1027839,you have to flash for it but honestly if
QYNKsR0qGt0,1027839,1029520,i think if he had been a little bit more
QYNKsR0qGt0,1029520,1031280,patient he could have lined it up a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1031280,1033120,little bit uh more effectively but
QYNKsR0qGt0,1033120,1035600,hindsight's 20 20 so it is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1035600,1037520,uh difficult to give him too much black
QYNKsR0qGt0,1037520,1039678,for it and also t1 wrapped around and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1039678,1041120,we're basically entering from three
QYNKsR0qGt0,1041120,1042480,locations
QYNKsR0qGt0,1042480,1044558,essentially because like gumo was able
QYNKsR0qGt0,1044558,1045760,to get over the wall there and come from
QYNKsR0qGt0,1045760,1047678,a completely different angle completely
QYNKsR0qGt0,1047678,1049200,dodged there so
QYNKsR0qGt0,1049200,1050720,normally some of the big plays we've
QYNKsR0qGt0,1050720,1052720,seen with that are when players or teams
QYNKsR0qGt0,1052720,1053919,are going into the choke point or
QYNKsR0qGt0,1053919,1055600,there's a little bit more control of the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1055600,1056799,fight whereas kwang don't slept and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1056799,1058320,spill through and there was no great
QYNKsR0qGt0,1058320,1060240,angle unless he flashed knocks up
QYNKsR0qGt0,1060240,1061840,gummies and they win the fight instantly
QYNKsR0qGt0,1061840,1063360,but they instantly lost it instead
QYNKsR0qGt0,1063360,1065360,because so once that's down like you
QYNKsR0qGt0,1065360,1068080,said the fight is over yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1068080,1070400,well mountain drake is alive owner going
QYNKsR0qGt0,1070400,1072080,to be taking this one down earth wind
QYNKsR0qGt0,1072080,1074080,and fire on the table
QYNKsR0qGt0,1074080,1076480,um which i would very much enjoy gary is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1076480,1078000,going to find some vision around here
QYNKsR0qGt0,1078000,1080000,we'll clear out this ward or just uh go
QYNKsR0qGt0,1080000,1082080,down and look to try and kill fate as
QYNKsR0qGt0,1082080,1083919,faker heads on up here he's going to get
QYNKsR0qGt0,1083919,1085600,the emperor's divide
QYNKsR0qGt0,1085600,1087200,that's a pretty high value bellows
QYNKsR0qGt0,1087200,1089039,breath but it's just that anyway have it
QYNKsR0qGt0,1089039,1090799,for the ensuing bubble and then
QYNKsR0qGt0,1090799,1093760,everybody else
QYNKsR0qGt0,1095679,1097520,this game as well but we may not even
QYNKsR0qGt0,1097520,1098559,get there
QYNKsR0qGt0,1098559,1101280,as uh this inner turret is going down
QYNKsR0qGt0,1101280,1102720,you know cole
QYNKsR0qGt0,1102720,1105039,almost completed here for keen he's got
QYNKsR0qGt0,1105039,1106799,two left would love to have that extra
QYNKsR0qGt0,1106799,1108320,gold for this back but he might be able
QYNKsR0qGt0,1108320,1109520,to afford it he's definitely built for
QYNKsR0qGt0,1109520,1111440,this first item but might have been able
QYNKsR0qGt0,1111440,1113440,to pick up a smaller second piece here
QYNKsR0qGt0,1113440,1115840,will be the wits in for him first yep
QYNKsR0qGt0,1115840,1117600,with this back timing so at least he is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1117600,1118960,able to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1118960,1120400,uh you know get a free back here and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1120400,1121679,push that wave through because that was
QYNKsR0qGt0,1121679,1123840,the lane that was completely left open
QYNKsR0qGt0,1123840,1126160,as yeah this is just fate like honestly
QYNKsR0qGt0,1126160,1127600,being a little bit greedy expecting to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1127600,1129120,maybe serve tight here and hold this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1129120,1130559,turret and then really fall nice
QYNKsR0qGt0,1130559,1132400,follow-up tidal wave after he blocks the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1132400,1134880,emperor's divide is cool but yeah bubble
QYNKsR0qGt0,1134880,1136799,after tidal wave lots of follow-up range
QYNKsR0qGt0,1136799,1139200,damage here and even though he's oren
QYNKsR0qGt0,1139200,1141280,he's just not tanky enough
QYNKsR0qGt0,1141280,1143039,nope especially not when he's just by
QYNKsR0qGt0,1143039,1145280,himself under a turret that uh he really
QYNKsR0qGt0,1145280,1147520,had no business business being here it's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1147520,1148880,going to mean a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1148880,1151360,five and a half thousand gold lead
QYNKsR0qGt0,1151360,1153280,for t1
QYNKsR0qGt0,1153280,1156640,and quantum freaks just really wish they
QYNKsR0qGt0,1156640,1159280,could just be given another 20 minutes
QYNKsR0qGt0,1159280,1161280,of this game yeah or maybe another
QYNKsR0qGt0,1161280,1163440,drafting phase perhaps
QYNKsR0qGt0,1163440,1164960,yeah perhaps
QYNKsR0qGt0,1164960,1166960,because i think the idea of this like on
QYNKsR0qGt0,1166960,1169200,mid is so interesting but you can't just
QYNKsR0qGt0,1169200,1171760,put scaling in every single one of your
QYNKsR0qGt0,1171760,1173440,lanes and hope that everything's gonna
QYNKsR0qGt0,1173440,1175120,be k yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1175120,1177039,and like if i could if there was one
QYNKsR0qGt0,1177039,1178640,team i would absolutely not want to do
QYNKsR0qGt0,1178640,1182080,that into it is t1 yeah it's this one
QYNKsR0qGt0,1182080,1184320,that's so like
QYNKsR0qGt0,1184320,1185679,it feels like the narratives are all
QYNKsR0qGt0,1185679,1188080,just lining up super hard for this one
QYNKsR0qGt0,1188080,1190480,and it feels bad if you're a freaks fan
QYNKsR0qGt0,1190480,1192720,because it's not a happy
QYNKsR0qGt0,1192720,1194480,ending probably it's definitely not a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1194480,1197120,happy reality right now it's not a happy
QYNKsR0qGt0,1197120,1199520,beginning or middle yeah that is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1199520,1201600,definitely true uh we haven't seen the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1201600,1203200,ending yet so i guess we can't really
QYNKsR0qGt0,1203200,1204880,say anything however
QYNKsR0qGt0,1204880,1206640,it's not looking great yeah the eight
QYNKsR0qGt0,1206640,1208880,ball is not in your favor the a ball is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1208880,1209679,safe
QYNKsR0qGt0,1209679,1212799,some of the more rough lines
QYNKsR0qGt0,1212799,1215360,yeah the uh like the most positive thing
QYNKsR0qGt0,1215360,1216799,the eight ball could say it's like try
QYNKsR0qGt0,1216799,1220000,again later yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1220000,1222080,that's if it's feeling generous at that
QYNKsR0qGt0,1222080,1223600,point in time doesn't want to hurt your
QYNKsR0qGt0,1223600,1224720,feelings
QYNKsR0qGt0,1224720,1226080,yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1226080,1228400,well yeah don't count on it is where i'm
QYNKsR0qGt0,1228400,1231600,at right now as t1 have all this vision
QYNKsR0qGt0,1231600,1233440,removed now around baron they don't have
QYNKsR0qGt0,1233440,1235200,a ton of damage without faker coming
QYNKsR0qGt0,1235200,1237440,over here just yet and he went rylai
QYNKsR0qGt0,1237440,1238799,second instead of going for the second
QYNKsR0qGt0,1238799,1240720,mask part of this because i think adding
QYNKsR0qGt0,1240720,1242799,that extra utility is going to really
QYNKsR0qGt0,1242799,1244880,help out especially against the kale and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1244880,1246799,the orange some of these miracle fights
QYNKsR0qGt0,1246799,1248480,that guangdong are looking for i don't
QYNKsR0qGt0,1248480,1249919,necessarily need that extra damage
QYNKsR0qGt0,1249919,1251840,because you're already so far ahead and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1251840,1253600,uh if you notice the ability here for
QYNKsR0qGt0,1253600,1255760,fate he's gone into negatron he's like
QYNKsR0qGt0,1255760,1258880,super hard on like i need to survive the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1258880,1261840,magic damage as much as possible with
QYNKsR0qGt0,1261840,1264240,this ap gwen ap azir
QYNKsR0qGt0,1264240,1266320,bursting me down even though i'm oren i
QYNKsR0qGt0,1266320,1267440,feel like i'm
QYNKsR0qGt0,1267440,1269200,seeing my life flash before my eyes in
QYNKsR0qGt0,1269200,1270480,every skirmish
QYNKsR0qGt0,1270480,1272400,he's elder wood on as well so you need a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1272400,1273919,force of nature it's thematically just
QYNKsR0qGt0,1273919,1276720,making much sense in my opinion he's got
QYNKsR0qGt0,1276720,1278240,a well he had a flank angle now he's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1278240,1280799,just lost half of hell far oh oh my
QYNKsR0qGt0,1280799,1282640,goodness fake there's so much damage
QYNKsR0qGt0,1282640,1285600,it's unbelievable oh my god
QYNKsR0qGt0,1285600,1288159,yeah yeah about seven forces of nature
QYNKsR0qGt0,1288159,1289120,please
QYNKsR0qGt0,1289120,1291039,as teddy just gonna get cut down by the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1291039,1292880,culling has to heal himself to keep
QYNKsR0qGt0,1292880,1294400,himself alive
QYNKsR0qGt0,1294400,1296159,well maybe he didn't have to but he did
QYNKsR0qGt0,1296159,1297600,i mean do you want to get it
QYNKsR0qGt0,1297600,1298720,because
QYNKsR0qGt0,1298720,1300240,right now is like ready to take an inner
QYNKsR0qGt0,1300240,1302720,turret maybe can they win this 4v5 down
QYNKsR0qGt0,1302720,1304799,here fate is always being dragged on
QYNKsR0qGt0,1304799,1306880,award you can't set up an horn you're on
QYNKsR0qGt0,1306880,1308799,a ward you don't have any vision control
QYNKsR0qGt0,1308799,1310559,where are those clears you know where is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1310559,1312400,the where's the value out of this this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1312400,1314320,is four versus five
QYNKsR0qGt0,1314320,1316320,and they have zeus just three foot in
QYNKsR0qGt0,1316320,1317760,the top lane like it's insane the amount
QYNKsR0qGt0,1317760,1319840,of pressure that t1 has
QYNKsR0qGt0,1319840,1321360,because they're the ones they're not
QYNKsR0qGt0,1321360,1323200,trying to hold off the siege or anything
QYNKsR0qGt0,1323200,1324799,like that to give zayas time they're
QYNKsR0qGt0,1324799,1327280,pushing yeah they're like winning in all
QYNKsR0qGt0,1327280,1329440,fronts isaiah says and now that's maybe
QYNKsR0qGt0,1329440,1332559,forced to walk away from this one yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1332559,1334640,there's okay the on horn comes on
QYNKsR0qGt0,1334640,1336320,through and yeah not as immune as you
QYNKsR0qGt0,1336320,1337440,ever want to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,1337440,1338880,this is the one that's going to be taken
QYNKsR0qGt0,1338880,1340559,down but i think it's right and outer
QYNKsR0qGt0,1340559,1342400,should uh go down yeah so there's all
QYNKsR0qGt0,1342400,1344080,right nice nice
QYNKsR0qGt0,1344080,1346640,now you go kill zayus who got the inner
QYNKsR0qGt0,1346640,1348960,which will allow us to grab another
QYNKsR0qGt0,1348960,1352080,inner so trading up once again and t1
QYNKsR0qGt0,1352080,1353840,yeah the 5000 gold lead went to eight
QYNKsR0qGt0,1353840,1356799,thousand off today's time yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1356799,1359520,and like t1 are looking at this going
QYNKsR0qGt0,1359520,1361280,okay it's gwen it's rift maker she can
QYNKsR0qGt0,1361280,1362720,go immune for a little bit so this will
QYNKsR0qGt0,1362720,1365039,100 buy us enough time
QYNKsR0qGt0,1365039,1366159,so
QYNKsR0qGt0,1366159,1368320,zeus is absolutely in the right to just
QYNKsR0qGt0,1368320,1370240,push this until four people come over
QYNKsR0qGt0,1370240,1373039,and they have to expend an ornhorn just
QYNKsR0qGt0,1373039,1375919,to catch him just to kill him
QYNKsR0qGt0,1375919,1377679,and now soul point is open for the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1377679,1380400,taking here for tijuana now keen
QYNKsR0qGt0,1380400,1381840,a little bit greedy looking for this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1381840,1383679,bounty here ellen's coming over has a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1383679,1385760,control ward yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1385760,1387039,there's a back coming through as well
QYNKsR0qGt0,1387039,1388799,they did have a few people in the area
QYNKsR0qGt0,1388799,1391600,uh scary is spotted on a ward hoyt it's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1391600,1393360,going to lick baron and t1 are going to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1393360,1395440,say oh i don't like this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1395440,1396640,they're like all right
QYNKsR0qGt0,1396640,1398080,i guess we will then this is what
QYNKsR0qGt0,1398080,1400240,someone does
QYNKsR0qGt0,1400240,1402240,there will be five people here if they
QYNKsR0qGt0,1402240,1404480,turn it's okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,1404480,1405840,but it looks like we're flipping
QYNKsR0qGt0,1405840,1407120,everyone that's just how it's going to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1407120,1409360,go kona over the wall there's the tidal
QYNKsR0qGt0,1409360,1411919,wave just by space and t1 just burst it
QYNKsR0qGt0,1411919,1414880,down yep and tidal wave to zone
QYNKsR0qGt0,1414880,1417440,cool so you almost got an inner turret
QYNKsR0qGt0,1417440,1419280,or rather excuse me an outer turret you
QYNKsR0qGt0,1419280,1421120,almost got your first turret of the game
QYNKsR0qGt0,1421120,1423120,and that thank god we rotate over there
QYNKsR0qGt0,1423120,1425120,they got a faker pushes the wave and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1425120,1426480,then we're actually going well since
QYNKsR0qGt0,1426480,1428240,we're over here and we have a million
QYNKsR0qGt0,1428240,1430159,items at this point we'll take the baron
QYNKsR0qGt0,1430159,1431039,i mean
QYNKsR0qGt0,1431039,1433200,the idea
QYNKsR0qGt0,1433200,1436159,and he was leashing i think yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1436159,1438080,and then um
QYNKsR0qGt0,1438080,1439919,they win the fight around baron get
QYNKsR0qGt0,1439919,1442320,pushing power to then get soul point
QYNKsR0qGt0,1442320,1444159,10 24 minutes it's a little bit slower
QYNKsR0qGt0,1444159,1445600,of a sole point because the first drake
QYNKsR0qGt0,1445600,1447600,was taken at 12. well we've been hitting
QYNKsR0qGt0,1447600,1450400,these on cooldown ever since yep
QYNKsR0qGt0,1450400,1451840,oh this is uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,1451840,1453279,this is really getting out of hand for
QYNKsR0qGt0,1453279,1454640,condom freaks
QYNKsR0qGt0,1454640,1456240,uh zone is going to move on over wind
QYNKsR0qGt0,1456240,1459039,becomes lightning onto
QYNKsR0qGt0,1463760,1465200,move back to this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1465200,1467200,mid-inhibitor turret that's looking to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1467200,1468799,go down pretty quickly in the meantime
QYNKsR0qGt0,1468799,1470559,guru mushi and zeus getting to work on
QYNKsR0qGt0,1470559,1472640,the bottom minion wave
QYNKsR0qGt0,1472640,1474640,as quantum freaks just look lost
QYNKsR0qGt0,1474640,1476000,not a whole lot of good options here
QYNKsR0qGt0,1476000,1478880,especially with the baron
QYNKsR0qGt0,1478880,1480240,yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1480240,1482880,i don't think we um
QYNKsR0qGt0,1482880,1484720,we're gonna be pretending a lot that
QYNKsR0qGt0,1484720,1487200,there's any hope left in this one
QYNKsR0qGt0,1487200,1489440,inhibitor down mid
QYNKsR0qGt0,1489440,1492080,full control reset and get all those
QYNKsR0qGt0,1492080,1494720,sweet items owner picks up a stopwatch
QYNKsR0qGt0,1494720,1497600,third item for kumusi will be the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1497600,1498799,um
QYNKsR0qGt0,1498799,1500480,lord dominic's will he'll pick it up
QYNKsR0qGt0,1500480,1502080,some extra control wards across the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1502080,1504640,board double mask a rather uh second
QYNKsR0qGt0,1504640,1506640,mask here for zeus not the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1506640,1507440,first
QYNKsR0qGt0,1507440,1509279,faker turns a blasting london to avoid
QYNKsR0qGt0,1509279,1510720,stuff yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1510720,1513360,immediately and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1513360,1514799,zeus
QYNKsR0qGt0,1514799,1516799,i don't know how much gold he's got on
QYNKsR0qGt0,1516799,1518559,hand but probably about to pick up his
QYNKsR0qGt0,1518559,1520000,natural suit
QYNKsR0qGt0,1520000,1522320,uh just kind of outright so
QYNKsR0qGt0,1522320,1524159,yeah the old third item before your
QYNKsR0qGt0,1524159,1527120,opponent has to finish their second
QYNKsR0qGt0,1527120,1528720,and then his second is the same one it's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1528720,1531039,like just the most tragedy situation
QYNKsR0qGt0,1531039,1531919,ever
QYNKsR0qGt0,1531919,1534240,yeah and still doesn't have a mythic yet
QYNKsR0qGt0,1534240,1536159,which is of course the uh kale way but
QYNKsR0qGt0,1536159,1538640,it still feels even worse fun on freaks
QYNKsR0qGt0,1538640,1540080,well and truly on the ropes ten thousand
QYNKsR0qGt0,1540080,1542480,gold the lead here nash has finally done
QYNKsR0qGt0,1542480,1544240,14
QYNKsR0qGt0,1544240,1546240,but i just don't think it's going to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1546240,1548240,mean anything at all he is level 14
QYNKsR0qGt0,1548240,1549520,still a couple more levels to see
QYNKsR0qGt0,1549520,1551440,whether he ever gets
QYNKsR0qGt0,1551440,1553840,blank yeah onto a control ward
QYNKsR0qGt0,1553840,1554880,hello
QYNKsR0qGt0,1554880,1557039,oh
QYNKsR0qGt0,1568880,1571120,meanwhile zeus is pushing two lanes by
QYNKsR0qGt0,1571120,1574480,himself yeah just casually gonna go with
QYNKsR0qGt0,1574480,1577039,certain threatened bottom inhibitor
QYNKsR0qGt0,1577039,1577840,and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1577840,1579520,the the waves are getting stacked
QYNKsR0qGt0,1579520,1580960,topside
QYNKsR0qGt0,1580960,1582720,do you wanna just basically like all in
QYNKsR0qGt0,1582720,1585120,the game right now if you guys make any
QYNKsR0qGt0,1585120,1586320,mistakes
QYNKsR0qGt0,1586320,1588480,so strong now that spawns in two and a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1588480,1589919,half minutes so choose your own
QYNKsR0qGt0,1589919,1591760,adventure following freaks how would you
QYNKsR0qGt0,1591760,1593440,like to lose yeah yeah i was gonna say
QYNKsR0qGt0,1593440,1595679,like the endings that i have available
QYNKsR0qGt0,1595679,1597600,to me mean that something must have gone
QYNKsR0qGt0,1597600,1600000,wrong around the rest of the story is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1600000,1600799,fate
QYNKsR0qGt0,1600799,1602559,yeah that's more than a backmaster is so
QYNKsR0qGt0,1602559,1604159,good man
QYNKsR0qGt0,1604159,1605679,as kerry's over here hunting for some
QYNKsR0qGt0,1605679,1606880,bubbles
QYNKsR0qGt0,1606880,1608720,forward there's the on horn she's gonna
QYNKsR0qGt0,1608720,1610240,flash it let's see whether he can keep
QYNKsR0qGt0,1610240,1611600,himself alive they are going to be able
QYNKsR0qGt0,1611600,1613600,to take him down now owner in amongst
QYNKsR0qGt0,1613600,1615600,this battle teddy looking to try and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1615600,1617440,take him down he goes golden as well as
QYNKsR0qGt0,1617440,1620159,t1 already they're not here double kill
QYNKsR0qGt0,1620159,1622080,goes over to elements now zeus is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1622080,1624240,chasing after them
QYNKsR0qGt0,1624240,1626559,and t1 is like two down so
QYNKsR0qGt0,1626559,1628080,you can't stop us you didn't you didn't
QYNKsR0qGt0,1628080,1630000,kill him
QYNKsR0qGt0,1630000,1631120,too low we're gonna
QYNKsR0qGt0,1631120,1633360,why is this the result shouldn't be the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1633360,1634960,result
QYNKsR0qGt0,1634960,1637440,and kuma like kuma still dies even
QYNKsR0qGt0,1637440,1638880,though he had those great dodgers okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,1638880,1640159,now they're gonna change that yeah now
QYNKsR0qGt0,1640159,1641279,we're going for it one more time oh
QYNKsR0qGt0,1641279,1642799,she's still trying to be pre-set up
QYNKsR0qGt0,1642799,1644159,though isaiah's we're gonna fight this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1644159,1646080,one out fate turns up as well teddy's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1646080,1648399,here all five members are in the area
QYNKsR0qGt0,1648399,1650399,okay there's carry on the emperor's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1650399,1652320,divide just amazing
QYNKsR0qGt0,1652320,1654960,toys gonna
QYNKsR0qGt0,1667440,1670000,why he'll pick up the kill here
QYNKsR0qGt0,1670000,1672960,he one will finish the game
QYNKsR0qGt0,1672960,1675200,he stacks at the end but whatever kills
QYNKsR0qGt0,1675200,1678000,the nexus is what you want to do
QYNKsR0qGt0,1678000,1681360,and this one is most definitely dead
QYNKsR0qGt0,1681360,1684480,t1 will take game number one gj guys and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1684480,1687919,we talked about it before the draft even
QYNKsR0qGt0,1687919,1690000,opened before we could even discuss game
QYNKsR0qGt0,1690000,1692159,states or priority is the mismatch
QYNKsR0qGt0,1692159,1695440,between t1 not the best game but it's a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1695440,1697760,see you in the game too guys that aspect
QYNKsR0qGt0,1697760,1700080,of the game
vid,start,end,text
QYNKsR0qGt0,0,1360,once you get to the very very later
QYNKsR0qGt0,1360,3280,parts of the game interesting uh there's
QYNKsR0qGt0,3280,4799,an awe so i guess we're playing
QYNKsR0qGt0,4799,7759,ornaments or mint yup looks that way
QYNKsR0qGt0,7759,10639,or it's tom kinchemid
QYNKsR0qGt0,10639,12000,i
QYNKsR0qGt0,12000,13679,i think the oran mid here we've seen it
QYNKsR0qGt0,13679,15599,a few times and you can
QYNKsR0qGt0,15599,17359,weather the storm against the
QYNKsR0qGt0,17359,19600,amount of azir poke but like
QYNKsR0qGt0,19600,23119,pryo will be nowhere for hwang dong okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,23119,25519,let's go to again very long time
QYNKsR0qGt0,25519,27359,we don't we go in minute one let's do it
QYNKsR0qGt0,27359,30359,now
QYNKsR0qGt0,31570,34880,[Applause]
QYNKsR0qGt0,35050,38140,[Music]
QYNKsR0qGt0,38960,41280,oh
QYNKsR0qGt0,41920,44160,the difference in fan chant definitely
QYNKsR0qGt0,44160,46239,uh quite pronounced
QYNKsR0qGt0,46239,48879,as always as i did say that we go in at
QYNKsR0qGt0,48879,50719,minute one i mean i guess technically
QYNKsR0qGt0,50719,53199,it's minute zero or minute oh like
QYNKsR0qGt0,53199,55520,second forty okay but the first minute
QYNKsR0qGt0,55520,57360,of league of legends starts at zero
QYNKsR0qGt0,57360,58320,right so i think you're still
QYNKsR0qGt0,58320,59920,technically hey there we go it's like
QYNKsR0qGt0,59920,62160,the korean birthday rule yeah everyone
QYNKsR0qGt0,62160,63680,starts at one
QYNKsR0qGt0,63680,67040,yeah as fate's like what what is this
QYNKsR0qGt0,67040,68720,i like elderwood on though so i think he
QYNKsR0qGt0,68720,70560,started off on the right foot okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,70560,72320,nobody's hurt each other pre one minute
QYNKsR0qGt0,72320,73920,either so you've got that you got that
QYNKsR0qGt0,73920,77360,going for you too yes yeah your court
QYNKsR0qGt0,77360,79600,um
QYNKsR0qGt0,80080,82320,quang dong have really priced themselves
QYNKsR0qGt0,82320,84840,into a draft where they're going to have
QYNKsR0qGt0,84840,87600,to play pretty passively
QYNKsR0qGt0,87600,90079,and not lose like all of their turrets
QYNKsR0qGt0,90079,92000,by 20 minutes which happens when you
QYNKsR0qGt0,92000,95280,face t1 which is why i think
QYNKsR0qGt0,95280,96000,of
QYNKsR0qGt0,96000,98159,strengths here for these two teams
QYNKsR0qGt0,98159,100000,interesting okay keen stripe he's the
QYNKsR0qGt0,100000,101280,best player on this team and then it's
QYNKsR0qGt0,101280,102880,also against as the best player actually
QYNKsR0qGt0,102880,104479,in the top lane this season and then
QYNKsR0qGt0,104479,106240,you've also drafted to like i hope they
QYNKsR0qGt0,106240,108399,don't get ahead early it's like ooh i'm
QYNKsR0qGt0,108399,109759,looking at these address and i'm feeling
QYNKsR0qGt0,109759,112079,like your chances of uh being even at
QYNKsR0qGt0,112079,113600,20.
QYNKsR0qGt0,113600,115600,very small but yeah let's wait and see
QYNKsR0qGt0,115600,118240,how it works out in practice but i don't
QYNKsR0qGt0,118240,120399,think guangdong has dealt themselves
QYNKsR0qGt0,120399,123200,a strong hand here
QYNKsR0qGt0,123200,125759,right now uh carrier gonna find some ebb
QYNKsR0qGt0,125759,126880,and flow
QYNKsR0qGt0,126880,129039,uh towards quantum freak's bottom lane
QYNKsR0qGt0,129039,131360,and yeah t1 with control of the wave a
QYNKsR0qGt0,131360,132800,little bit more wavelet look at the mid
QYNKsR0qGt0,132800,136400,lane by the way already like i mean yes
QYNKsR0qGt0,136400,137599,it's not looking good you know that's
QYNKsR0qGt0,137599,139360,how it goes in the early parts
QYNKsR0qGt0,139360,142160,i mean i will say you can bellows breath
QYNKsR0qGt0,142160,143680,through the emperor's divide if you time
QYNKsR0qGt0,143680,144800,it correctly
QYNKsR0qGt0,144800,146720,so that's pretty cool
QYNKsR0qGt0,146720,148239,um
QYNKsR0qGt0,148239,150000,whether that's relevant because of the
QYNKsR0qGt0,150000,152319,fact that faker can set up sand soldiers
QYNKsR0qGt0,152319,153920,and just
QYNKsR0qGt0,153920,155680,destroy everyone there's a little bit of
QYNKsR0qGt0,155680,157200,a worry remember this game i remember
QYNKsR0qGt0,157200,158000,this game this was the game where they
QYNKsR0qGt0,158000,160319,built like all 80s right and like didn't
QYNKsR0qGt0,160319,163040,have any magic damage i want to say yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,163040,164720,this was a strength this was like where
QYNKsR0qGt0,164720,167519,the on was like this is my counterpiece
QYNKsR0qGt0,167519,170319,and it didn't really work as a faker
QYNKsR0qGt0,170319,172400,just gonna have to watch as his x team
QYNKsR0qGt0,172400,174480,big ball spy casually but knows where
QYNKsR0qGt0,174480,176800,faker was in lane at that moment they
QYNKsR0qGt0,176800,178400,have a ward down to the bottom part of
QYNKsR0qGt0,178400,180239,that lane too to spot out a rotation
QYNKsR0qGt0,180239,182239,like this and now because they know the
QYNKsR0qGt0,182239,183920,path timing there's actually a little
QYNKsR0qGt0,183920,186080,bit of potential here for owner to do
QYNKsR0qGt0,186080,187680,some shenanigans because faker has that
QYNKsR0qGt0,187680,189360,prio and this is the power of early
QYNKsR0qGt0,189360,190879,leads especially when you give prior on
QYNKsR0qGt0,190879,192080,blue side
QYNKsR0qGt0,192080,194000,you have so much potential as the enemy
QYNKsR0qGt0,194000,195680,junglers he's gonna look for it
QYNKsR0qGt0,195680,197280,yeah he's gonna get in there audacious
QYNKsR0qGt0,197280,199120,charge goes down wind becomes lightning
QYNKsR0qGt0,199120,201040,not going to connect thanks for watching
QYNKsR0qGt0,201040,204319,the big wraith did go over to ellen but
QYNKsR0qGt0,204319,207760,now tijuana is going to three buff d1 is
QYNKsR0qGt0,207760,209760,so dominating
QYNKsR0qGt0,209760,212080,lm gonna rap all the way around as you
QYNKsR0qGt0,212080,213920,can see and t1 with so much control here
QYNKsR0qGt0,213920,215040,towards the bottom side as well i mean
QYNKsR0qGt0,215040,216720,this is what we're expecting this is
QYNKsR0qGt0,216720,219120,what should be happening right now
QYNKsR0qGt0,219120,221280,but uh the quantum freaks they just need
QYNKsR0qGt0,221280,223680,to do their very best to hold on
QYNKsR0qGt0,223680,225920,right now it's already starting to look
QYNKsR0qGt0,225920,227040,rough
QYNKsR0qGt0,227040,228159,yeah i mean we haven't passed the point
QYNKsR0qGt0,228159,229920,in the return or anything that is yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,229920,231920,just to point out he's got like one loss
QYNKsR0qGt0,231920,233040,on lee sin
QYNKsR0qGt0,233040,235680,and uh one loss on the asian child
QYNKsR0qGt0,235680,237760,is being pretty good yeah he's um you
QYNKsR0qGt0,237760,240480,know when you keep winning all the time
QYNKsR0qGt0,240480,242159,those win rates for every champion that
QYNKsR0qGt0,242159,243200,you're playing especially the meadow
QYNKsR0qGt0,243200,246560,where it's like chinchou or lee sin
QYNKsR0qGt0,246560,248799,that's gonna get it's gonna get up there
QYNKsR0qGt0,248799,251280,well alan's decided that uh jungling is
QYNKsR0qGt0,251280,252400,not for him
QYNKsR0qGt0,252400,255280,and zeus has decided that uh he kind of
QYNKsR0qGt0,255280,256320,knew
QYNKsR0qGt0,256320,258160,as that ward is going to give zeus all
QYNKsR0qGt0,258160,260880,the information that he ever wanted
QYNKsR0qGt0,260880,263199,and so now ellen's going to soak some
QYNKsR0qGt0,263199,265440,experience
QYNKsR0qGt0,265440,267520,but otherwise this is a counter gank
QYNKsR0qGt0,267520,269440,that could go absolutely absolutely
QYNKsR0qGt0,269440,271600,wrong yeah freaks ellen doesn't know
QYNKsR0qGt0,271600,273759,he's been spotted yeah even the cannon
QYNKsR0qGt0,273759,276880,goes wide as owner charging up the
QYNKsR0qGt0,276880,278960,knockoff as they flash on in they are
QYNKsR0qGt0,278960,281840,going for keen nice
QYNKsR0qGt0,281840,283919,trying to run away
QYNKsR0qGt0,283919,287520,oh dear t1 just knew exactly what was
QYNKsR0qGt0,287520,289759,going on zeus is just holding his finger
QYNKsR0qGt0,289759,291440,over the flash key
QYNKsR0qGt0,291440,292960,or rather owner is holding his finger
QYNKsR0qGt0,292960,294400,over the flash key knowing that elem is
QYNKsR0qGt0,294400,295680,there knowing because he was spot on a
QYNKsR0qGt0,295680,298080,war this w stun is coming
QYNKsR0qGt0,298080,299600,and they almost turn this into a kill
QYNKsR0qGt0,299600,302560,it's two flashes here for a ghost
QYNKsR0qGt0,302560,304800,as uh at least the knock-up hits
QYNKsR0qGt0,304800,306639,yeah face actually popping some brittle
QYNKsR0qGt0,306639,307919,here
QYNKsR0qGt0,307919,309440,nicely done
QYNKsR0qGt0,309440,312320,but the thing about this is t1 are one
QYNKsR0qGt0,312320,314160,step ahead they predict this rotation
QYNKsR0qGt0,314160,316400,because they've given elem no options
QYNKsR0qGt0,316400,317919,and this draft puts element a place
QYNKsR0qGt0,317919,320160,where with no prio he has to make these
QYNKsR0qGt0,320160,321919,tough decisions and a player like elm
QYNKsR0qGt0,321919,323120,hasn't always been known for his
QYNKsR0qGt0,323120,326240,decisiveness but watch this flash setup
QYNKsR0qGt0,326240,330240,just waits for it waits for it boom
QYNKsR0qGt0,330800,332720,it's on top of keen first to get the
QYNKsR0qGt0,332720,333680,kill
QYNKsR0qGt0,333680,336800,two flashes for a ghost he just read
QYNKsR0qGt0,336800,338320,that completely and it's all to do with
QYNKsR0qGt0,338320,340320,that waters let's have a look at this
QYNKsR0qGt0,340320,342560,dude
QYNKsR0qGt0,344240,345919,okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,345919,348639,okay okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,350620,353919,[Applause]
QYNKsR0qGt0,353919,356639,he's like my cooldowns are too long so
QYNKsR0qGt0,356639,358080,it's like too bad it basically was like
QYNKsR0qGt0,358080,359759,oh unlucky we couldn't get two kills
QYNKsR0qGt0,359759,362400,there this was what he said essentially
QYNKsR0qGt0,362400,364880,uh and
QYNKsR0qGt0,364880,367280,yeah i mean it was already going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,367280,369199,rough but after that it's going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,369199,372319,even worse for the quantum priests
QYNKsR0qGt0,372319,374479,a t1 currently just cruising
QYNKsR0qGt0,374479,376400,and it's not to say like we're talking
QYNKsR0qGt0,376400,378160,about this like quantum freaks are just
QYNKsR0qGt0,378160,380080,going to win if things get uh to late
QYNKsR0qGt0,380080,382240,game no i mean the scaling on t one side
QYNKsR0qGt0,382240,383680,is also great
QYNKsR0qGt0,383680,385520,um it's just no we're doing it again the
QYNKsR0qGt0,385520,387759,same as quantum freaks as uh yeah owners
QYNKsR0qGt0,387759,389520,thinking about a dive or maybe thinking
QYNKsR0qGt0,389520,391120,about just uh taking away ellen's camera
QYNKsR0qGt0,391120,393360,yes no it's dive time
QYNKsR0qGt0,393360,395280,as isaias he does and they're just
QYNKsR0qGt0,395280,397039,looking to plate ganks there's the knock
QYNKsR0qGt0,397039,398479,up as ellen's trying to do what he can
QYNKsR0qGt0,398479,400639,because
QYNKsR0qGt0,400960,402880,up here t1 will take away the rest of
QYNKsR0qGt0,402880,404319,these minions and
QYNKsR0qGt0,404319,406400,goodness
QYNKsR0qGt0,406400,409039,and then
QYNKsR0qGt0,411840,413520,oh no
QYNKsR0qGt0,413520,415360,it turns out there is no weak side for
QYNKsR0qGt0,415360,416479,t1
QYNKsR0qGt0,416479,419039,in this game there is no excite doesn't
QYNKsR0qGt0,419039,421440,exist it's just three strong sides
QYNKsR0qGt0,421440,424400,there's a third side atlas yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,424400,426080,those losing plates and bottom losing
QYNKsR0qGt0,426080,428800,plates on top and i'm learning about new
QYNKsR0qGt0,428800,431599,dimensions here thank you so much uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,431599,434560,just so many sides to this one
QYNKsR0qGt0,434560,436400,uh issue just
QYNKsR0qGt0,436400,438400,grabs a plate towards that bottom side
QYNKsR0qGt0,438400,439919,there is uh teddy picking up his
QYNKsR0qGt0,439919,441360,swifties
QYNKsR0qGt0,441360,443440,as fate's eating some honey fruit and
QYNKsR0qGt0,443440,445520,faker is just
QYNKsR0qGt0,445520,448160,shoving this wave relentlessly because
QYNKsR0qGt0,448160,450080,it's just so hard to put on any pressure
QYNKsR0qGt0,450080,452080,yeah uh when it's uh when these are the
QYNKsR0qGt0,452080,453599,lanes that you are dealt
QYNKsR0qGt0,453599,455759,so six is up here for zeus and like it
QYNKsR0qGt0,455759,457280,could have been a plate gank but keen is
QYNKsR0qGt0,457280,459360,like so nervous he steps away from the
QYNKsR0qGt0,459360,460800,turret here and then they're like i mean
QYNKsR0qGt0,460800,462639,there's such a huge wave it's just too
QYNKsR0qGt0,462639,464000,too good of an opportunity to pass off
QYNKsR0qGt0,464000,464960,and they're like all right we'll get
QYNKsR0qGt0,464960,468720,everything here plates deny cs 20 cs the
QYNKsR0qGt0,468720,471759,leader now isaias yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,471759,473039,and i mean this matchup doesn't get
QYNKsR0qGt0,473039,474960,easier for a long time
QYNKsR0qGt0,474960,477039,kane does make it to level six so there
QYNKsR0qGt0,477039,479199,is at least that it's going to be harder
QYNKsR0qGt0,479199,481199,to dive in but
QYNKsR0qGt0,481199,483680,i still think that uh yeah given what
QYNKsR0qGt0,483680,486479,this looks like it's so incredibly
QYNKsR0qGt0,486479,488560,difficult for kane to even get towards
QYNKsR0qGt0,488560,490639,these minions and that's what happens
QYNKsR0qGt0,490639,491840,when you lose two flashes in the
QYNKsR0qGt0,491840,493360,previous attempt as well like yeah they
QYNKsR0qGt0,493360,495199,didn't get double kills unlucky but
QYNKsR0qGt0,495199,496960,owner's back he's like i know you don't
QYNKsR0qGt0,496960,498479,have to splash i know we could pull this
QYNKsR0qGt0,498479,499919,off you don't even have that one second
QYNKsR0qGt0,499919,501759,to buy with flash
QYNKsR0qGt0,501759,503360,as rift herald here
QYNKsR0qGt0,503360,505599,the setup is
QYNKsR0qGt0,505599,507440,i mean they're they're hard pushing for
QYNKsR0qGt0,507440,509440,it among them freaks do be hard because
QYNKsR0qGt0,509440,510960,they know that if they lose this one the
QYNKsR0qGt0,510960,512719,game just really snowballs against them
QYNKsR0qGt0,512719,513839,but i don't know if this is a winning
QYNKsR0qGt0,513839,515760,fight lucian not here of course teleport
QYNKsR0qGt0,515760,517839,down yeah sweep his spots it out his
QYNKsR0qGt0,517839,520240,height is going to be bubbled
QYNKsR0qGt0,520240,522080,baker getting some shots on over
QYNKsR0qGt0,522080,525200,isaiah's up towards the top side
QYNKsR0qGt0,525200,527040,rotating in keene's going to get round
QYNKsR0qGt0,527040,528959,though five versus four for the moment
QYNKsR0qGt0,528959,530959,there's the on horn as fate dashes
QYNKsR0qGt0,530959,532160,forward they're looking for owner he
QYNKsR0qGt0,532160,533920,throws down the off but still manages to
QYNKsR0qGt0,533920,536160,die
QYNKsR0qGt0,536560,538640,through as the culling comes down as
QYNKsR0qGt0,538640,540720,well kumiyushi joining the fight keems
QYNKsR0qGt0,540720,542480,so incredibly low ellen gets his
QYNKsR0qGt0,542480,544640,ultimate and then the kale dies
QYNKsR0qGt0,544640,547040,unfortunately ellen trying to run this
QYNKsR0qGt0,547040,548480,one out though as they do manage to get
QYNKsR0qGt0,548480,551120,the reset onto zayus
QYNKsR0qGt0,551120,552720,as heartbreaker gets element out of
QYNKsR0qGt0,552720,554080,there gummy she may be stepping a little
QYNKsR0qGt0,554080,556320,bit too far forward gets knocked up on
QYNKsR0qGt0,556320,559519,it's just real good
QYNKsR0qGt0,559519,560880,available faker's gonna shift sands
QYNKsR0qGt0,560880,562160,sanskrit over the wall but he's the
QYNKsR0qGt0,562160,565360,wrong side of the rift and ellen is just
QYNKsR0qGt0,565360,567839,popping off in this fight teddy grabs
QYNKsR0qGt0,567839,570560,that kill and kwandong freaks they walk
QYNKsR0qGt0,570560,572480,away victorious they will i have the
QYNKsR0qGt0,572480,574160,herald goes over to hoyt he is able to
QYNKsR0qGt0,574160,576880,pick that one off so t1 fighting into a
QYNKsR0qGt0,576880,579279,choke point here without guma you see
QYNKsR0qGt0,579279,581200,really ends up fighting them in the back
QYNKsR0qGt0,581200,583440,because they're so hell bent on forcing
QYNKsR0qGt0,583440,584800,this one out
QYNKsR0qGt0,584800,586160,even though they have arguably the
QYNKsR0qGt0,586160,587200,better team fight here when you're
QYNKsR0qGt0,587200,588640,fighting into a choke like this you
QYNKsR0qGt0,588640,591120,don't actually and baker comes over here
QYNKsR0qGt0,591120,593360,and first divide he's decent but not
QYNKsR0qGt0,593360,595040,amazing and goomba's trying to do what
QYNKsR0qGt0,595040,596399,damage he can
QYNKsR0qGt0,596399,597760,but i mean
QYNKsR0qGt0,597760,599920,this is just unfortunately too difficult
QYNKsR0qGt0,599920,601519,to pull off at this stage without your
QYNKsR0qGt0,601519,603440,80 carry because the old comes down for
QYNKsR0qGt0,603440,606000,kale and they get out scot-free now t1 i
QYNKsR0qGt0,606000,607760,believe still has a pretty nice gold
QYNKsR0qGt0,607760,609519,lead after this
QYNKsR0qGt0,609519,611440,but bit of an over-extension here nice
QYNKsR0qGt0,611440,614800,turnaround by the catfish and crew and
QYNKsR0qGt0,614800,616640,yeah dawning shadow being held for that
QYNKsR0qGt0,616640,620240,long as well i think really baited uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,620240,621920,at that point in time because the amount
QYNKsR0qGt0,621920,622720,of
QYNKsR0qGt0,622720,625519,extra survivability that uh kwandong
QYNKsR0qGt0,625519,627519,freaks just sort of had
QYNKsR0qGt0,627519,630640,on hand was very very high so now you
QYNKsR0qGt0,630640,633200,know kale still in trouble but picks up
QYNKsR0qGt0,633200,634959,three assists worth of gold you know
QYNKsR0qGt0,634959,636640,santa is one zero and three now a lot of
QYNKsR0qGt0,636640,638320,extra money for her
QYNKsR0qGt0,638320,639360,a lot of
QYNKsR0qGt0,639360,641279,you know advantages here for t1 still on
QYNKsR0qGt0,641279,643120,top side they can still try to dive but
QYNKsR0qGt0,643120,644800,it gets harder and harder you know the
QYNKsR0qGt0,644800,646399,more kills you give over
QYNKsR0qGt0,646399,647600,but there's at least four they're at
QYNKsR0qGt0,647600,649200,least forcing ellen to stay here and
QYNKsR0qGt0,649200,650399,they are going to be able to get their
QYNKsR0qGt0,650399,653200,plate advantage increased by this play
QYNKsR0qGt0,653200,655279,yeah owner moves up they know that ellen
QYNKsR0qGt0,655279,657200,is still there as well as keane doesn't
QYNKsR0qGt0,657200,658880,quite have his ultimate available again
QYNKsR0qGt0,658880,662079,just yet heartbreaker is up though
QYNKsR0qGt0,662079,663680,crescent garden need to work both there
QYNKsR0qGt0,663680,665200,as well swim becomes blinding is not
QYNKsR0qGt0,665200,666800,quite long enough
QYNKsR0qGt0,666800,667680,keane
QYNKsR0qGt0,667680,670000,does manage to regain some control of
QYNKsR0qGt0,670000,671120,the lane
QYNKsR0qGt0,671120,672160,yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,672160,673680,and owner was fishing there if he gets
QYNKsR0qGt0,673680,675760,into the right spot could actually push
QYNKsR0qGt0,675760,677920,keen away with the crescent guard and
QYNKsR0qGt0,677920,679680,then actually they take him out so
QYNKsR0qGt0,679680,680720,forcing them to play a little bit more
QYNKsR0qGt0,680720,683279,passively they do not secure that second
QYNKsR0qGt0,683279,684880,plate top side well defended here by
QYNKsR0qGt0,684880,687120,quantum freaks the santa angle though
QYNKsR0qGt0,687120,688560,becoming a lot more comfortable now for
QYNKsR0qGt0,688560,689760,teddy is he's picked up all that extra
QYNKsR0qGt0,689760,691040,gold he's starting to get a few stacks
QYNKsR0qGt0,691040,692640,under his belt and the sustain that he
QYNKsR0qGt0,692640,693920,has here in lane is going to make it so
QYNKsR0qGt0,693920,696160,that he can actually aggressively trade
QYNKsR0qGt0,696160,698800,yeah and nami you know her ultimate
QYNKsR0qGt0,698800,700399,may have to even be used defensively in
QYNKsR0qGt0,700399,701760,some of these scenarios and upcoming
QYNKsR0qGt0,701760,706480,fights if uh the prio isn't there
QYNKsR0qGt0,709360,710959,taking a bit of damage conquering sans
QYNKsR0qGt0,710959,713279,as well as some of these autos
QYNKsR0qGt0,713279,715040,doing a fair bit of work communication
QYNKsR0qGt0,715040,716480,teleports back to this lane though has
QYNKsR0qGt0,716480,718000,his gale force available as the bubble
QYNKsR0qGt0,718000,719680,goes wide unless he was aiming for the
QYNKsR0qGt0,719680,721760,minions in which case absolutely fine
QYNKsR0qGt0,721760,723680,not quite long enough on that snare as
QYNKsR0qGt0,723680,726079,keem picks up berserker's greaves
QYNKsR0qGt0,726079,727760,and he'll uh teleport back towards that
QYNKsR0qGt0,727760,730079,top lane first drake at 12 minutes here
QYNKsR0qGt0,730079,732240,it looks like so with all that pressure
QYNKsR0qGt0,732240,734000,in the lane and t1 slack of interest in
QYNKsR0qGt0,734000,735519,getting a drake they just wanted to get
QYNKsR0qGt0,735519,736639,the gold lead like you were talking
QYNKsR0qGt0,736639,738320,about they aren't really big drake
QYNKsR0qGt0,738320,740240,focusers generally speaking yep they
QYNKsR0qGt0,740240,741680,didn't grab that with the prior they had
QYNKsR0qGt0,741680,744160,and now congo set their sights on it for
QYNKsR0qGt0,744160,746160,just a moment but will finally be pushed
QYNKsR0qGt0,746160,748720,away but it is a very slow start to the
QYNKsR0qGt0,748720,750959,drake counter this game
QYNKsR0qGt0,750959,752560,yeah they're going to move over here now
QYNKsR0qGt0,752560,753279,and
QYNKsR0qGt0,753279,755519,hoyt still hasn't used either herald it
QYNKsR0qGt0,755519,757680,is starting to wear off i'm a little bit
QYNKsR0qGt0,757680,759680,worried about the herald situation
QYNKsR0qGt0,759680,761120,because they are very far away from
QYNKsR0qGt0,761120,762399,enemy turrets
QYNKsR0qGt0,762399,765120,yeah that's the best drake
QYNKsR0qGt0,765120,766880,we'll lose place with the timing of this
QYNKsR0qGt0,766880,769360,so drake goes over the prior just never
QYNKsR0qGt0,769360,771120,ends man even with kuang dun freaks
QYNKsR0qGt0,771120,773519,taking a kill lead here the gold lead is
QYNKsR0qGt0,773519,776399,advantage tijuan the herald has
QYNKsR0qGt0,776399,779120,it's not great if you are in a lane to
QYNKsR0qGt0,779120,780079,drop a hero because you don't have any
QYNKsR0qGt0,780079,781920,prio in any of these three anyways but
QYNKsR0qGt0,781920,784240,he's like walking down the lane as this
QYNKsR0qGt0,784240,786399,is timing out we'll have to drop it now
QYNKsR0qGt0,786399,789200,yeah it drops it in the mid lane
QYNKsR0qGt0,789200,792079,and uh faker is teleporting back but you
QYNKsR0qGt0,792079,793519,can see quantum freaks are going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,793519,794800,able to get some control here so it
QYNKsR0qGt0,794800,797920,should be charged successful yeah it has
QYNKsR0qGt0,797920,800079,to be owners coming over to maybe punish
QYNKsR0qGt0,800079,801760,a straggler
QYNKsR0qGt0,801760,803120,but won't be able to do so the charge
QYNKsR0qGt0,803120,805760,will complete yep nicely done uh almost
QYNKsR0qGt0,805760,807440,able to get the next charge as well but
QYNKsR0qGt0,807440,808240,uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,808240,811360,surely shelly sorry will be dealt with
QYNKsR0qGt0,811360,812639,and keen's starting to trade back a
QYNKsR0qGt0,812639,814320,little bit better still kept that uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,814320,816320,gold advantage for zeus at about that
QYNKsR0qGt0,816320,818320,20cs mark which
QYNKsR0qGt0,818320,819920,you know is something to be expected
QYNKsR0qGt0,819920,821920,especially after all of the uh attention
QYNKsR0qGt0,821920,825199,that he got as zeus is uh yeah still
QYNKsR0qGt0,825199,827199,winning every single trade
QYNKsR0qGt0,827199,829360,yep man has his needle work he's holding
QYNKsR0qGt0,829360,831199,the stacked queue
QYNKsR0qGt0,831199,833360,and he's just gonna you know try to deny
QYNKsR0qGt0,833360,835920,as much experience and canon minions as
QYNKsR0qGt0,835920,837199,he can here and
QYNKsR0qGt0,837199,838639,now with a 30 cs advantage and every
QYNKsR0qGt0,838639,840480,time he has the ability to dash q he'll
QYNKsR0qGt0,840480,842639,take it oh yeah and
QYNKsR0qGt0,842639,843680,the leaching layer is going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,843680,845199,massive in this case as karia is
QYNKsR0qGt0,845199,847680,rotating up does have the ability to alt
QYNKsR0qGt0,847680,849680,gank here you know obviously then just
QYNKsR0qGt0,849680,852560,drop his ignite and walk away casually
QYNKsR0qGt0,852560,854560,so a lot of extra pressure and lucian's
QYNKsR0qGt0,854560,856160,happy to just lane against the tom ken i
QYNKsR0qGt0,856160,858879,don't think it's good
QYNKsR0qGt0,859440,861360,more stacks and you know be more
QYNKsR0qGt0,861360,862720,frustrating elsewhere this is kind of
QYNKsR0qGt0,862720,864880,the meta but you know this means you're
QYNKsR0qGt0,864880,866720,putting yourself in a catch lane things
QYNKsR0qGt0,866720,869040,can be very annoying at least for now
QYNKsR0qGt0,869040,870560,he does have his mythic available but
QYNKsR0qGt0,870560,873920,guma is happy to continue pressure
QYNKsR0qGt0,873920,876240,and pyromandic done here for carrier bit
QYNKsR0qGt0,876240,878959,of an aggressive choice i like it a lot
QYNKsR0qGt0,878959,880639,uh soldiers
QYNKsR0qGt0,880639,882639,just are manning the entryways to this
QYNKsR0qGt0,882639,884720,mid lane faker having just the greatest
QYNKsR0qGt0,884720,887199,of times right now on his asia
QYNKsR0qGt0,887199,888560,especially now that his league andres is
QYNKsR0qGt0,888560,891040,done yeah against an oran he's just like
QYNKsR0qGt0,891040,892560,every time i touch you you're feeling
QYNKsR0qGt0,892560,894880,terrible yeah the itemization this game
QYNKsR0qGt0,894880,896839,for nazir is not even
QYNKsR0qGt0,896839,898560,yeah it's like literally so easy this
QYNKsR0qGt0,898560,899519,time
QYNKsR0qGt0,899519,901040,uh spanking does have to shift some
QYNKsR0qGt0,901040,902880,sands to get away here ellen decent
QYNKsR0qGt0,902880,904160,little stun
QYNKsR0qGt0,904160,906320,but fake is still just going to be uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,906320,908959,healed back up by the nami
QYNKsR0qGt0,908959,912880,as ellen i think realized that his
QYNKsR0qGt0,912880,915519,rib up was stolen
QYNKsR0qGt0,915519,918079,gwen pushing top side here is keene
QYNKsR0qGt0,918079,919839,forced to come over and try to set up
QYNKsR0qGt0,919839,921600,for a fast take here but it's a santa
QYNKsR0qGt0,921600,924160,comp i try to rush this sound cool yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,924160,925920,i know t1 need to be careful about going
QYNKsR0qGt0,925920,927519,through that choke point maybe splitting
QYNKsR0qGt0,927519,928959,and wrapping around would be the better
QYNKsR0qGt0,928959,930079,option and that is what they're looking
QYNKsR0qGt0,930079,931680,for here clear that vision
QYNKsR0qGt0,931680,934320,yeah gwen flank is real for zeus here
QYNKsR0qGt0,934320,936480,there's the on horn though there's the
QYNKsR0qGt0,936480,938639,just dodges it though and fate's gonna
QYNKsR0qGt0,938639,940320,have to be devoured dance gets exhausted
QYNKsR0qGt0,940320,942000,as soon as he can cheers he comes on
QYNKsR0qGt0,942000,944079,through keane has an ultimate on himself
QYNKsR0qGt0,944079,945600,no one's died just yet but fate should
QYNKsR0qGt0,945600,947759,be the first and there he goes faker is
QYNKsR0qGt0,947759,950079,going to be given the kill and says
QYNKsR0qGt0,950079,951759,picks up one as well
QYNKsR0qGt0,951759,953680,if at first you don't succeed try again
QYNKsR0qGt0,953680,955519,just one more time and it'll be way
QYNKsR0qGt0,955519,958639,better the setup was really nice and
QYNKsR0qGt0,958639,960320,fate tries to
QYNKsR0qGt0,960320,962320,do a king in there and flash during the
QYNKsR0qGt0,962320,964240,ultimate but he's unable to catch the
QYNKsR0qGt0,964240,965920,dodging loose
QYNKsR0qGt0,965920,967440,that one so adeptly
QYNKsR0qGt0,967440,969839,you don't have the damage it's a sena
QYNKsR0qGt0,969839,971680,with an umbrella glaive
QYNKsR0qGt0,971680,973519,try trying to push this drake there or
QYNKsR0qGt0,973519,975440,whether this herald down you don't have
QYNKsR0qGt0,975440,977680,advantage here your kale is not even
QYNKsR0qGt0,977680,979199,level 11 yet
QYNKsR0qGt0,979199,980880,and so like
QYNKsR0qGt0,980880,982160,i don't know it's just a bad time and
QYNKsR0qGt0,982160,984000,it's a bad decision
QYNKsR0qGt0,984000,985360,but like what other choices are you
QYNKsR0qGt0,985360,986160,making you're just going to sit there
QYNKsR0qGt0,986160,987680,and lose your turn lose the rip turret
QYNKsR0qGt0,987680,988800,like you have to try to fight you have
QYNKsR0qGt0,988800,990399,to try to rush this down maybe look for
QYNKsR0qGt0,990399,992320,the turn fight with the ornhorn which is
QYNKsR0qGt0,992320,994240,exactly what fate tries to do
QYNKsR0qGt0,994240,997360,here and flashes for it fails it do
QYNKsR0qGt0,997360,998639,music gets away and then the fight is
QYNKsR0qGt0,998639,999759,over but we're just watching the
QYNKsR0qGt0,999759,1001440,fireworks here team's like i'm holding
QYNKsR0qGt0,1001440,1003040,myself guys sorry i'm going to be
QYNKsR0qGt0,1003040,1004560,selfish here i don't want to lose
QYNKsR0qGt0,1004560,1006560,anymore you guys on the left side of
QYNKsR0qGt0,1006560,1008240,this fight are dunzo
QYNKsR0qGt0,1008240,1010320,and keenan ellen will fall down t1 pick
QYNKsR0qGt0,1010320,1012320,up the second herald yep keen ulting
QYNKsR0qGt0,1012320,1014800,himself and just trying to get away um
QYNKsR0qGt0,1014800,1017519,as as soon as that one horn did nothing
QYNKsR0qGt0,1017519,1020160,that was it that was it yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1020160,1021440,could have been so much more valuable
QYNKsR0qGt0,1021440,1024160,though it felt like fate was like this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1024160,1026079,is how all of the best players are made
QYNKsR0qGt0,1026079,1027839,you have to flash for it but honestly if
QYNKsR0qGt0,1027839,1029520,i think if he had been a little bit more
QYNKsR0qGt0,1029520,1031280,patient he could have lined it up a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1031280,1033120,little bit uh more effectively but
QYNKsR0qGt0,1033120,1035600,hindsight's 20 20 so it is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1035600,1037520,uh difficult to give him too much black
QYNKsR0qGt0,1037520,1039678,for it and also t1 wrapped around and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1039678,1041120,we're basically entering from three
QYNKsR0qGt0,1041120,1042480,locations
QYNKsR0qGt0,1042480,1044558,essentially because like gumo was able
QYNKsR0qGt0,1044558,1045760,to get over the wall there and come from
QYNKsR0qGt0,1045760,1047678,a completely different angle completely
QYNKsR0qGt0,1047678,1049200,dodged there so
QYNKsR0qGt0,1049200,1050720,normally some of the big plays we've
QYNKsR0qGt0,1050720,1052720,seen with that are when players or teams
QYNKsR0qGt0,1052720,1053919,are going into the choke point or
QYNKsR0qGt0,1053919,1055600,there's a little bit more control of the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1055600,1056799,fight whereas kwang don't slept and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1056799,1058320,spill through and there was no great
QYNKsR0qGt0,1058320,1060240,angle unless he flashed knocks up
QYNKsR0qGt0,1060240,1061840,gummies and they win the fight instantly
QYNKsR0qGt0,1061840,1063360,but they instantly lost it instead
QYNKsR0qGt0,1063360,1065360,because so once that's down like you
QYNKsR0qGt0,1065360,1068080,said the fight is over yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1068080,1070400,well mountain drake is alive owner going
QYNKsR0qGt0,1070400,1072080,to be taking this one down earth wind
QYNKsR0qGt0,1072080,1074080,and fire on the table
QYNKsR0qGt0,1074080,1076480,um which i would very much enjoy gary is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1076480,1078000,going to find some vision around here
QYNKsR0qGt0,1078000,1080000,we'll clear out this ward or just uh go
QYNKsR0qGt0,1080000,1082080,down and look to try and kill fate as
QYNKsR0qGt0,1082080,1083919,faker heads on up here he's going to get
QYNKsR0qGt0,1083919,1085600,the emperor's divide
QYNKsR0qGt0,1085600,1087200,that's a pretty high value bellows
QYNKsR0qGt0,1087200,1089039,breath but it's just that anyway have it
QYNKsR0qGt0,1089039,1090799,for the ensuing bubble and then
QYNKsR0qGt0,1090799,1093760,everybody else
QYNKsR0qGt0,1095679,1097520,this game as well but we may not even
QYNKsR0qGt0,1097520,1098559,get there
QYNKsR0qGt0,1098559,1101280,as uh this inner turret is going down
QYNKsR0qGt0,1101280,1102720,you know cole
QYNKsR0qGt0,1102720,1105039,almost completed here for keen he's got
QYNKsR0qGt0,1105039,1106799,two left would love to have that extra
QYNKsR0qGt0,1106799,1108320,gold for this back but he might be able
QYNKsR0qGt0,1108320,1109520,to afford it he's definitely built for
QYNKsR0qGt0,1109520,1111440,this first item but might have been able
QYNKsR0qGt0,1111440,1113440,to pick up a smaller second piece here
QYNKsR0qGt0,1113440,1115840,will be the wits in for him first yep
QYNKsR0qGt0,1115840,1117600,with this back timing so at least he is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1117600,1118960,able to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1118960,1120400,uh you know get a free back here and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1120400,1121679,push that wave through because that was
QYNKsR0qGt0,1121679,1123840,the lane that was completely left open
QYNKsR0qGt0,1123840,1126160,as yeah this is just fate like honestly
QYNKsR0qGt0,1126160,1127600,being a little bit greedy expecting to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1127600,1129120,maybe serve tight here and hold this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1129120,1130559,turret and then really fall nice
QYNKsR0qGt0,1130559,1132400,follow-up tidal wave after he blocks the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1132400,1134880,emperor's divide is cool but yeah bubble
QYNKsR0qGt0,1134880,1136799,after tidal wave lots of follow-up range
QYNKsR0qGt0,1136799,1139200,damage here and even though he's oren
QYNKsR0qGt0,1139200,1141280,he's just not tanky enough
QYNKsR0qGt0,1141280,1143039,nope especially not when he's just by
QYNKsR0qGt0,1143039,1145280,himself under a turret that uh he really
QYNKsR0qGt0,1145280,1147520,had no business business being here it's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1147520,1148880,going to mean a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1148880,1151360,five and a half thousand gold lead
QYNKsR0qGt0,1151360,1153280,for t1
QYNKsR0qGt0,1153280,1156640,and quantum freaks just really wish they
QYNKsR0qGt0,1156640,1159280,could just be given another 20 minutes
QYNKsR0qGt0,1159280,1161280,of this game yeah or maybe another
QYNKsR0qGt0,1161280,1163440,drafting phase perhaps
QYNKsR0qGt0,1163440,1164960,yeah perhaps
QYNKsR0qGt0,1164960,1166960,because i think the idea of this like on
QYNKsR0qGt0,1166960,1169200,mid is so interesting but you can't just
QYNKsR0qGt0,1169200,1171760,put scaling in every single one of your
QYNKsR0qGt0,1171760,1173440,lanes and hope that everything's gonna
QYNKsR0qGt0,1173440,1175120,be k yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1175120,1177039,and like if i could if there was one
QYNKsR0qGt0,1177039,1178640,team i would absolutely not want to do
QYNKsR0qGt0,1178640,1182080,that into it is t1 yeah it's this one
QYNKsR0qGt0,1182080,1184320,that's so like
QYNKsR0qGt0,1184320,1185679,it feels like the narratives are all
QYNKsR0qGt0,1185679,1188080,just lining up super hard for this one
QYNKsR0qGt0,1188080,1190480,and it feels bad if you're a freaks fan
QYNKsR0qGt0,1190480,1192720,because it's not a happy
QYNKsR0qGt0,1192720,1194480,ending probably it's definitely not a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1194480,1197120,happy reality right now it's not a happy
QYNKsR0qGt0,1197120,1199520,beginning or middle yeah that is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1199520,1201600,definitely true uh we haven't seen the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1201600,1203200,ending yet so i guess we can't really
QYNKsR0qGt0,1203200,1204880,say anything however
QYNKsR0qGt0,1204880,1206640,it's not looking great yeah the eight
QYNKsR0qGt0,1206640,1208880,ball is not in your favor the a ball is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1208880,1209679,safe
QYNKsR0qGt0,1209679,1212799,some of the more rough lines
QYNKsR0qGt0,1212799,1215360,yeah the uh like the most positive thing
QYNKsR0qGt0,1215360,1216799,the eight ball could say it's like try
QYNKsR0qGt0,1216799,1220000,again later yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1220000,1222080,that's if it's feeling generous at that
QYNKsR0qGt0,1222080,1223600,point in time doesn't want to hurt your
QYNKsR0qGt0,1223600,1224720,feelings
QYNKsR0qGt0,1224720,1226080,yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1226080,1228400,well yeah don't count on it is where i'm
QYNKsR0qGt0,1228400,1231600,at right now as t1 have all this vision
QYNKsR0qGt0,1231600,1233440,removed now around baron they don't have
QYNKsR0qGt0,1233440,1235200,a ton of damage without faker coming
QYNKsR0qGt0,1235200,1237440,over here just yet and he went rylai
QYNKsR0qGt0,1237440,1238799,second instead of going for the second
QYNKsR0qGt0,1238799,1240720,mask part of this because i think adding
QYNKsR0qGt0,1240720,1242799,that extra utility is going to really
QYNKsR0qGt0,1242799,1244880,help out especially against the kale and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1244880,1246799,the orange some of these miracle fights
QYNKsR0qGt0,1246799,1248480,that guangdong are looking for i don't
QYNKsR0qGt0,1248480,1249919,necessarily need that extra damage
QYNKsR0qGt0,1249919,1251840,because you're already so far ahead and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1251840,1253600,uh if you notice the ability here for
QYNKsR0qGt0,1253600,1255760,fate he's gone into negatron he's like
QYNKsR0qGt0,1255760,1258880,super hard on like i need to survive the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1258880,1261840,magic damage as much as possible with
QYNKsR0qGt0,1261840,1264240,this ap gwen ap azir
QYNKsR0qGt0,1264240,1266320,bursting me down even though i'm oren i
QYNKsR0qGt0,1266320,1267440,feel like i'm
QYNKsR0qGt0,1267440,1269200,seeing my life flash before my eyes in
QYNKsR0qGt0,1269200,1270480,every skirmish
QYNKsR0qGt0,1270480,1272400,he's elder wood on as well so you need a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1272400,1273919,force of nature it's thematically just
QYNKsR0qGt0,1273919,1276720,making much sense in my opinion he's got
QYNKsR0qGt0,1276720,1278240,a well he had a flank angle now he's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1278240,1280799,just lost half of hell far oh oh my
QYNKsR0qGt0,1280799,1282640,goodness fake there's so much damage

QYNKsR0qGt0,1304799,1306880,award you can't set up an horn you're on
QYNKsR0qGt0,1306880,1308799,a ward you don't have any vision control
QYNKsR0qGt0,1308799,1310559,where are those clears you know where is
QYNKsR0qGt0,1310559,1312400,the where's the value out of this this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1312400,1314320,is four versus five
QYNKsR0qGt0,1314320,1316320,and they have zeus just three foot in
QYNKsR0qGt0,1316320,1317760,the top lane like it's insane the amount
QYNKsR0qGt0,1317760,1319840,of pressure that t1 has
QYNKsR0qGt0,1319840,1321360,because they're the ones they're not
QYNKsR0qGt0,1321360,1323200,trying to hold off the siege or anything
QYNKsR0qGt0,1323200,1324799,like that to give zayas time they're
QYNKsR0qGt0,1324799,1327280,pushing yeah they're like winning in all
QYNKsR0qGt0,1327280,1329440,fronts isaiah says and now that's maybe
QYNKsR0qGt0,1329440,1332559,forced to walk away from this one yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1332559,1334640,there's okay the on horn comes on
QYNKsR0qGt0,1334640,1336320,through and yeah not as immune as you

QYNKsR0qGt0,1337440,1338880,this is the one that's going to be taken
QYNKsR0qGt0,1338880,1340559,down but i think it's right and outer
QYNKsR0qGt0,1340559,1342400,should uh go down yeah so there's all
QYNKsR0qGt0,1342400,1344080,right nice nice
QYNKsR0qGt0,1344080,1346640,now you go kill zayus who got the inner
QYNKsR0qGt0,1346640,1348960,which will allow us to grab another
QYNKsR0qGt0,1348960,1352080,inner so trading up once again and t1
QYNKsR0qGt0,1352080,1353840,yeah the 5000 gold lead went to eight
QYNKsR0qGt0,1353840,1356799,thousand off today's time yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1356799,1359520,and like t1 are looking at this going
QYNKsR0qGt0,1359520,1361280,okay it's gwen it's rift maker she can
QYNKsR0qGt0,1361280,1362720,go immune for a little bit so this will
QYNKsR0qGt0,1362720,1365039,100 buy us enough time
QYNKsR0qGt0,1365039,1366159,so
QYNKsR0qGt0,1366159,1368320,zeus is absolutely in the right to just
QYNKsR0qGt0,1368320,1370240,push this until four people come over
QYNKsR0qGt0,1370240,1373039,and they have to expend an ornhorn just
QYNKsR0qGt0,1373039,1375919,to catch him just to kill him
QYNKsR0qGt0,1375919,1377679,and now soul point is open for the
QYNKsR0qGt0,1377679,1380400,taking here for tijuana now keen
QYNKsR0qGt0,1380400,1381840,a little bit greedy looking for this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1381840,1383679,bounty here ellen's coming over has a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1383679,1385760,control ward yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1385760,1387039,there's a back coming through as well
QYNKsR0qGt0,1387039,1388799,they did have a few people in the area
QYNKsR0qGt0,1388799,1391600,uh scary is spotted on a ward hoyt it's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1391600,1393360,going to lick baron and t1 are going to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1393360,1395440,say oh i don't like this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1395440,1396640,they're like all right
QYNKsR0qGt0,1396640,1398080,i guess we will then this is what
QYNKsR0qGt0,1398080,1400240,someone does
QYNKsR0qGt0,1400240,1402240,there will be five people here if they
QYNKsR0qGt0,1402240,1404480,turn it's okay
QYNKsR0qGt0,1404480,1405840,but it looks like we're flipping
QYNKsR0qGt0,1405840,1407120,everyone that's just how it's going to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1407120,1409360,go kona over the wall there's the tidal
QYNKsR0qGt0,1409360,1411919,wave just by space and t1 just burst it
QYNKsR0qGt0,1411919,1414880,down yep and tidal wave to zone
QYNKsR0qGt0,1414880,1417440,cool so you almost got an inner turret
QYNKsR0qGt0,1417440,1419280,or rather excuse me an outer turret you
QYNKsR0qGt0,1419280,1421120,almost got your first turret of the game
QYNKsR0qGt0,1421120,1423120,and that thank god we rotate over there
QYNKsR0qGt0,1423120,1425120,they got a faker pushes the wave and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1425120,1426480,then we're actually going well since
QYNKsR0qGt0,1426480,1428240,we're over here and we have a million
QYNKsR0qGt0,1428240,1430159,items at this point we'll take the baron
QYNKsR0qGt0,1430159,1431039,i mean
QYNKsR0qGt0,1431039,1433200,the idea
QYNKsR0qGt0,1433200,1436159,and he was leashing i think yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1436159,1438080,and then um
QYNKsR0qGt0,1438080,1439919,they win the fight around baron get
QYNKsR0qGt0,1439919,1442320,pushing power to then get soul point
QYNKsR0qGt0,1442320,1444159,10 24 minutes it's a little bit slower
QYNKsR0qGt0,1444159,1445600,of a sole point because the first drake
QYNKsR0qGt0,1445600,1447600,was taken at 12. well we've been hitting
QYNKsR0qGt0,1447600,1450400,these on cooldown ever since yep
QYNKsR0qGt0,1450400,1451840,oh this is uh
QYNKsR0qGt0,1451840,1453279,this is really getting out of hand for
QYNKsR0qGt0,1453279,1454640,condom freaks
QYNKsR0qGt0,1454640,1456240,uh zone is going to move on over wind
QYNKsR0qGt0,1456240,1459039,becomes lightning onto
QYNKsR0qGt0,1463760,1465200,move back to this
QYNKsR0qGt0,1465200,1467200,mid-inhibitor turret that's looking to
QYNKsR0qGt0,1467200,1468799,go down pretty quickly in the meantime

QYNKsR0qGt0,1470559,1472640,the bottom minion wave
QYNKsR0qGt0,1472640,1474640,as quantum freaks just look lost
QYNKsR0qGt0,1474640,1476000,not a whole lot of good options here
QYNKsR0qGt0,1476000,1478880,especially with the baron
QYNKsR0qGt0,1478880,1480240,yeah
QYNKsR0qGt0,1480240,1482880,i don't think we um
QYNKsR0qGt0,1482880,1484720,we're gonna be pretending a lot that
QYNKsR0qGt0,1484720,1487200,there's any hope left in this one
QYNKsR0qGt0,1487200,1489440,inhibitor down mid
QYNKsR0qGt0,1489440,1492080,full control reset and get all those

QYNKsR0qGt0,1520000,1522320,uh just kind of outright so
QYNKsR0qGt0,1522320,1524159,yeah the old third item before your
QYNKsR0qGt0,1524159,1527120,opponent has to finish their second
QYNKsR0qGt0,1527120,1528720,and then his second is the same one it's
QYNKsR0qGt0,1528720,1531039,like just the most tragedy situation

QYNKsR0qGt0,1546240,1548240,mean anything at all he is level 14
QYNKsR0qGt0,1548240,1549520,still a couple more levels to see

QYNKsR0qGt0,1672960,1675200,he stacks at the end but whatever kills
QYNKsR0qGt0,1675200,1678000,the nexus is what you want to do
QYNKsR0qGt0,1678000,1681360,and this one is most definitely dead
QYNKsR0qGt0,1681360,1684480,t1 will take game number one gj guys and
QYNKsR0qGt0,1684480,1687919,we talked about it before the draft even
QYNKsR0qGt0,1687919,1690000,opened before we could even discuss game
QYNKsR0qGt0,1690000,1692159,states or priority is the mismatch
QYNKsR0qGt0,1692159,1695440,between t1 not the best game but it's a
QYNKsR0qGt0,1695440,1697760,see you in the game too guys that aspect
QYNKsR0qGt0,1697760,1700080,of the game
