1j-q5RgOfwI,728639,730880,northern thai food a proud dish that's
1j-q5RgOfwI,730880,733120,so beloved that there's an entire
1j-q5RgOfwI,733120,735279,lab-eating culture that surrounds it
1j-q5RgOfwI,735279,738079,beef or buffalo is most common

1j-q5RgOfwI,744320,746079,yes this is the spot right here there's
1j-q5RgOfwI,746079,747519,almost like a bar counter seating at the
1j-q5RgOfwI,747519,749120,front and then you walk back into the
1j-q5RgOfwI,749120,753800,their yard into the house here
1j-q5RgOfwI,754190,757849,[Music]
1j-q5RgOfwI,760079,762240,just from the way he moves the bowl he
1j-q5RgOfwI,762240,765600,is such a master he's focused on the lob
1j-q5RgOfwI,765600,767760,that's all raw minced buffalo so it's
1j-q5RgOfwI,767760,773639,really dark dark like maroon beet red

1j-q5RgOfwI,816890,818240,[Music]
1j-q5RgOfwI,818240,819360,that is
1j-q5RgOfwI,819360,822480,a groundbreaking plate of blob
1j-q5RgOfwI,822480,824079,is a bit more of a sit down family
1j-q5RgOfwI,824079,828920,dining experience that's also fantastic
1j-q5RgOfwI,830650,832720,[Music]
1j-q5RgOfwI,832720,834399,i think most of the dishes have just
1j-q5RgOfwI,834399,836160,arrived the two center pieces these are
1j-q5RgOfwI,836160,838000,the two lobs that we got this is a
1j-q5RgOfwI,838000,840560,cooked plate of lava made with pig pork
1j-q5RgOfwI,840560,841839,you can see the toasted garlic in there
1j-q5RgOfwI,841839,843839,the cilantro and the green onions
1j-q5RgOfwI,843839,847120,and the fried garlic on top

1j-q5RgOfwI,857920,860560,good as well it's all the same spices as
1j-q5RgOfwI,860560,862000,in the raw version
1j-q5RgOfwI,862000,864480,just it's more of like a warm feel as
1j-q5RgOfwI,864480,866160,opposed to the refreshing coolness of
1j-q5RgOfwI,866160,867680,raw meat
1j-q5RgOfwI,867680,869360,a personal favorite thai food for me
1j-q5RgOfwI,869360,870880,something i wouldn't leave chiang mai
1j-q5RgOfwI,870880,873600,without eating is gay noon chicken
1j-q5RgOfwI,873600,876160,typically free range dressed in copious
1j-q5RgOfwI,876160,878399,amounts of herbs and aromatics and
1j-q5RgOfwI,878399,881680,steamed kong kao muang probably does the
1j-q5RgOfwI,881680,884240,best version i've ever had and now
1j-q5RgOfwI,884240,885519,normally if you go to a northern thai
1j-q5RgOfwI,885519,886959,restaurant they would serve you just a
1j-q5RgOfwI,886959,888959,single piece of chicken maybe a leg
1j-q5RgOfwI,888959,891760,maybe a chicken breast here they serve
1j-q5RgOfwI,891760,894560,you the entire chicken and then just
1j-q5RgOfwI,894560,897120,literally a handful of chopped
1j-q5RgOfwI,897120,899680,coriander on top this smells incredible
1j-q5RgOfwI,899680,901040,this is one of my favorite northern thai
1j-q5RgOfwI,901040,902800,dishes and since the drumstick is so
1j-q5RgOfwI,902800,905440,handy and pickupable with a handle i'll
