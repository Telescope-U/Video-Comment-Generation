CzfWPGDAS4g,76479,82720,but tom also had a very good luck  which always helped him get away with
CzfWPGDAS4g,82720,86600,the mischief he did
CzfWPGDAS4g,88080,93680,one day his aunt polly was looking for  him  tom

CzfWPGDAS4g,128800,133950,him  tom  stop hiding and come out now
CzfWPGDAS4g,133950,140000,[Music]  but there was no answer  suddenly
CzfWPGDAS4g,140000,146959,aunt polly saw something move under  tom's bed  she thought it was tom
CzfWPGDAS4g,146959,154879,she bent down and swiftly pulled the bed  cover  a cat that tom had hid in there sprung
CzfWPGDAS4g,154879,160720,out at aunt polly  surprised looking at this she shouted
CzfWPGDAS4g,160720,165740,oh dear where did tom get the cat wait  till i find that boy
CzfWPGDAS4g,165740,172160,[Music]  just as aunt polly was shooing the cat
CzfWPGDAS4g,172160,179680,out of the window she felt someone  behind her  it was tom trying to escape from the
CzfWPGDAS4g,179680,188159,room  [Music]  he had been hiding in the cupboard
CzfWPGDAS4g,188800,195120,aunt polly caught him by the collar  tom  what were you doing hiding in the
CzfWPGDAS4g,195120,201280,cupboard you ate all the jam didn't you  ah no aunt polly

CzfWPGDAS4g,219920,227040,you have become too mischievous  aunt polly look behind you
CzfWPGDAS4g,227040,234799,aunt polly turned to see but there was  no one  it was just one of tom's tricks
CzfWPGDAS4g,234799,240480,and this time he used it to get away  from aunt polly
CzfWPGDAS4g,240480,246239,because when she turned around again he  wasn't there  oh this boy
CzfWPGDAS4g,246239,252480,one of these days i am going to punish  him  tom was so happy with himself for
CzfWPGDAS4g,252480,259840,fooling aunt polly again that he decided  to take the day off from school
CzfWPGDAS4g,266080,271680,instead he went to the river and bathed  in it
CzfWPGDAS4g,278960,284160,at lunch time he went into a nearby farm
CzfWPGDAS4g,286080,292880,stole fruits from there and ran out of  there with the owner chasing behind him
CzfWPGDAS4g,292880,300400,just as he was running he bumped into  sid  sid saw tom's wet hair and clothes and
CzfWPGDAS4g,300400,306479,the fruits in his hands and understood  that tom hadn't gone to school but he
CzfWPGDAS4g,306479,310120,didn't say anything
CzfWPGDAS4g,313120,319120,when tom reached home  aunt polly was waiting for him and she
CzfWPGDAS4g,319120,326080,was angry  tom understood that sid had told her  everything
CzfWPGDAS4g,326080,333440,tom did you skip school again  ah no aunt polly said is lying
CzfWPGDAS4g,333440,339120,how did you know sid said anything to me  well

CzfWPGDAS4g,366240,372880,punishment  tom had no choice he couldn't argue with  aunt polly
CzfWPGDAS4g,372880,378080,he didn't want to make her angrier  but he was angry too
CzfWPGDAS4g,378080,384560,the fence would take up his whole  saturday  he went into the yard and kicked at the
CzfWPGDAS4g,384560,386960,dust
CzfWPGDAS4g,389600,395680,just then he saw sid coming in  [Music]
CzfWPGDAS4g,395680,401039,he quickly made a mud ball and swung it  at him  ah

CzfWPGDAS4g,406880,412160,aunt polly  tom flung a few more mud balls at sid
CzfWPGDAS4g,412160,417280,and then jumped over the fence and ran  away
CzfWPGDAS4g,417759,425199,he knew  he was already punished so nothing worse  could happen now  [Music]
CzfWPGDAS4g,425199,430720,next morning when tom came down for  breakfast he was greeted with a pail of
CzfWPGDAS4g,430720,436560,paint and paint brushes  [Music]
CzfWPGDAS4g,436560,441919,aunt polly had been serious about his  punishment
CzfWPGDAS4g,441919,449720,so tom ate his breakfast and went into  the yard to whitewash the fence
CzfWPGDAS4g,461479,467759,painstakingly he finished a bit of it  that's when his friend joe came up to
CzfWPGDAS4g,467759,474000,him  hey tom  why are you working on a saturday  morning
CzfWPGDAS4g,474000,482160,working  who said anything about walking  well  why are you painting the fence then

CzfWPGDAS4g,495360,502080,why else would i do it  joe thought about it
CzfWPGDAS4g,502240,508639,it was true  tom sawyer would never do anything that  wasn't fun
CzfWPGDAS4g,508639,513758,he asked tom  if he could also try it
CzfWPGDAS4g,514880,520880,tom agreed to let joe do only a small  portion of it in exchange of three
CzfWPGDAS4g,520880,526399,marbles  joe thought three marbles was too much
CzfWPGDAS4g,526399,532820,but agreed  he wanted to try art
CzfWPGDAS4g,532820,536629,[Music]
CzfWPGDAS4g,541480,548240,[Music]  a little while later their friend jim  came
CzfWPGDAS4g,548240,553390,he saw tom resting under the tree and  joe painting the fence
CzfWPGDAS4g,553390,559760,[Music]  he went to joe  what are you doing joe
CzfWPGDAS4g,559760,565360,it is art i paid tom three marbles to  let me do it

CzfWPGDAS4g,571120,576399,very good  jim dashed to tom immediately and asked
CzfWPGDAS4g,576399,583360,if in exchange of his fishbook  he too could whitewash the fence
CzfWPGDAS4g,583360,589360,tom feigned some reluctance  but agreed
CzfWPGDAS4g,589360,592880,and so it went on
CzfWPGDAS4g,596560,604120,other friends of tom came and believed  that painting the fence was fun
CzfWPGDAS4g,605040,610480,they paid tom in collectors cards  candies and even a catapult to get a
CzfWPGDAS4g,610480,616560,chance to paint the fence  [Music]
CzfWPGDAS4g,616560,624160,by noon the entire fence was painted and  tom was a rich boy
CzfWPGDAS4g,624330,631000,[Music]  he hid his treasures and went to his  aunt
CzfWPGDAS4g,636000,641180,it's done  what  unbelievable  let me see

CzfWPGDAS4g,674880,680720,but as always  when aunt polly turned around to tell
CzfWPGDAS4g,680720,687720,tom that his punishment was over  he was already gone
CzfWPGDAS4g,693120,700760,the next day was sunday  and tom went to sunday school

CzfWPGDAS4g,724399,729879,he went to one of the smartest boys in  the class
CzfWPGDAS4g,733440,738959,and bought from him all his yellow  tickets in exchange of the treasure he

CzfWPGDAS4g,758639,764240,when you had enough yellow tickets you  could exchange them for a bible
CzfWPGDAS4g,764240,769440,the minister asked the class  does anyone have enough yellow tickets
CzfWPGDAS4g,769440,778000,for a bible  nobody had so many tickets  except tom who raised his hand
CzfWPGDAS4g,778000,786320,everybody including the minister was  surprised  tom was the most naughty boy they knew
CzfWPGDAS4g,786320,793200,how could he have learned all the verses  of the bible  the minister understood this was one of
CzfWPGDAS4g,793200,800720,tom's tricks  and he decided to test him  very well done tom please come here and

CzfWPGDAS4g,1657760,1664720,she would tell her many tales of the  mountains while clara would tell her  about the different cities she had
CzfWPGDAS4g,1664720,1669840,stayed in after her mother had passed  away
CzfWPGDAS4g,1670480,1676480,while the housekeeper was very stern and  always stopped the girls from enjoying
CzfWPGDAS4g,1676480,1684159,themselves too much clara's grandmother  was very nice she even taught heidi how
CzfWPGDAS4g,1684159,1689679,to read  everybody who met clara now noted how
CzfWPGDAS4g,1689679,1693398,happy she looked
CzfWPGDAS4g,1696640,1701600,one day the girls went out to the market
CzfWPGDAS4g,1702720,1711000,as heidi pushed the wheelchair forward  she saw a vendor selling daffodils
CzfWPGDAS4g,1711840,1717679,she was immediately reminded of home  her grandfather
CzfWPGDAS4g,1717679,1724720,peter  and granny  when they came back from the market

CzfWPGDAS4g,1769360,1774559,looked out of the window and saw  buildings and towers instead of
CzfWPGDAS4g,1774559,1781919,mountains and sky  this went on till one day she felt

CzfWPGDAS4g,2043850,2050000,[Music]  jack and the beanstalk
CzfWPGDAS4g,2052560,2059440,once upon a time there lived a widow  with her only son named jack
CzfWPGDAS4g,2059440,2064879,their times were really hard  and they were living in poverty for long
CzfWPGDAS4g,2064879,2070960,[Music]  jack was too young to work and earn  money
CzfWPGDAS4g,2070960,2076720,all their house furniture and other  belongings  were sold off to carry on with their
CzfWPGDAS4g,2076720,2083440,basic daily needs  until at last they were left with a cow
CzfWPGDAS4g,2083440,2089358,who used to give milk every day and that  they used to sell off in the market to
CzfWPGDAS4g,2089358,2094800,buy bread  one day the poor old cow didn't give any
CzfWPGDAS4g,2094800,2102320,milk  that's when jack suggested his mother  i think we should sell off this cow and
CzfWPGDAS4g,2102320,2108880,get a good return embargo  so jack left to sell off the cow in the
CzfWPGDAS4g,2108880,2114240,market  on the way he met a butcher
CzfWPGDAS4g,2114560,2121119,oh  where are you going jack  i'm going to the market to sell off this
CzfWPGDAS4g,2121119,2127359,cow for a good bargain  oh why take the trouble to go that far
CzfWPGDAS4g,2127359,2133520,i have a very good deal for you he took  out five strange looking beans from his
CzfWPGDAS4g,2133520,2140000,pocket and handed them to jack  jack looked little haste as to what kind
CzfWPGDAS4g,2140000,2146240,of good bargain it is oh my god  they are so beautiful what do you call
CzfWPGDAS4g,2146240,2154560,these  beans  magical beans  if you plant them overnight by the next
CzfWPGDAS4g,2154560,2160640,morning they will grow up and reach the  sky  wow
CzfWPGDAS4g,2160640,2166000,mother would be so happy to see them  thank you mr butcher
CzfWPGDAS4g,2166000,2172400,anoff went back happily to his mother  and showed her the magical beans
CzfWPGDAS4g,2172400,2178400,but to his disappointment she only got  angry at him and shouted
CzfWPGDAS4g,2178400,2184160,off you go to bed right away  she threw the beans outside the kitchen
CzfWPGDAS4g,2184160,2191599,window and into the backyard and went  off to her bed crying and weeping
CzfWPGDAS4g,2191599,2197200,the next morning when jack woke up he  saw outside his window
CzfWPGDAS4g,2197200,2204800,and to his surprise he saw a great  beanstalk reaching up to the sky
CzfWPGDAS4g,2206000,2213359,oh my god  this beanstalk is so huge  i need to climb this up to see where it
CzfWPGDAS4g,2213359,2222480,leads to  he climbed up and up and up till his  home looked a mere spot on the ground
CzfWPGDAS4g,2222800,2230400,at last the stock ended and jack found  himself in a completely different place
CzfWPGDAS4g,2230400,2236880,but suddenly a beautiful lady appeared  and said
CzfWPGDAS4g,2236880,2244079,hello jack you don't know me but i know  you and everything about you
CzfWPGDAS4g,2244079,2251280,the castle you see there belongs to a  giant who stole all your father's money
CzfWPGDAS4g,2251280,2258400,and killed him  your mother had kept the secret from you  to protect you
CzfWPGDAS4g,2258400,2265680,he owes you jack  the lady disappeared in thin air
CzfWPGDAS4g,2265680,2275760,jack kept standing there and thinking  he surely owes me and my family
CzfWPGDAS4g,2277680,2282839,far away where the road ended he could  see a huge
CzfWPGDAS4g,2282839,2289520,castle he went up to the castle and  knocked on the huge door
CzfWPGDAS4g,2289520,2296960,a giant woman opened the door  she looked scary and howled at jack
CzfWPGDAS4g,2296960,2305440,what do you want  uh if you please ma'am  would you kindly give me some breakfast
CzfWPGDAS4g,2305440,2311839,i haven't eaten anything since yesterday  the giant woman though looked cruel and
CzfWPGDAS4g,2311839,2318720,ugly had a kind heart and offered jack a  huge plate of english breakfast but
CzfWPGDAS4g,2318720,2327838,warned him  you must finish quickly before my giant  husband comes back and eats you
CzfWPGDAS4g,2329040,2336640,then suddenly there was a huge knock on  the door  and the wife picked up jack and hid him
CzfWPGDAS4g,2336640,2344880,in a huge empty kettle  as the door opened the giant entered and
CzfWPGDAS4g,2344880,2352839,roared  see fifo thumb  i smell the blood of an english
CzfWPGDAS4g,2352839,2361119,man he alive or be he dead i'll grind  his bones to make my bread
CzfWPGDAS4g,2361119,2366320,nonsense you're mistaken it's the ox  hide you smell
CzfWPGDAS4g,2366320,2372560,so he sat down at the table and ate the  ox that his wife had served him as
CzfWPGDAS4g,2372560,2377600,breakfast  after he finished he asked his wife
CzfWPGDAS4g,2377600,2383599,[Music]  get me my money moneybags
CzfWPGDAS4g,2383680,2391760,[Music]  he started counting his money but he was  so sleepy that he slept on the table
CzfWPGDAS4g,2391760,2396960,the whole room was roaring with his  snore
CzfWPGDAS4g,2396960,2402640,jack taking an opportunity of this time  got out of the kettle
CzfWPGDAS4g,2402640,2410480,picked up the money bags and ran towards  the door  before the giant woke up he climbed down
CzfWPGDAS4g,2410480,2418400,the beanstalk and to his cottage  and did not look back even once
CzfWPGDAS4g,2418400,2423599,he took a sigh of relief and ran to his  mother  [Music]
CzfWPGDAS4g,2423599,2430079,mother  look what i got we are rich now the  mother and the son lived quiet
CzfWPGDAS4g,2430079,2438079,comfortably  till one afternoon when his mother was  away he decided to go up to the giant's
CzfWPGDAS4g,2438079,2444160,castle and see what was happening there  so he climbed up the beanstalk and
CzfWPGDAS4g,2444160,2450960,reached the castle  there standing at the door he saw the
CzfWPGDAS4g,2450960,2456160,giant's wife again  but she didn't recognize him because he
CzfWPGDAS4g,2456160,2462640,was dressed impeccably this time  uh if he please ma'am
CzfWPGDAS4g,2462640,2469119,he said  will you give me some breakfast  run away you little boy
CzfWPGDAS4g,2469119,2474319,last time a boy came he stole my  husband's money bags
CzfWPGDAS4g,2474319,2480759,but since she was kind-hearted she  offered jack breakfast
CzfWPGDAS4g,2481599,2488000,at that very moment the giant knocked on  the dough and quickly she hid jack in
CzfWPGDAS4g,2488000,2494839,the oven  the giant entered and roared
CzfWPGDAS4g,2495599,2502800,i smell the blood of an english man  be alive will be he dead
CzfWPGDAS4g,2502800,2510800,i'll grind his bones to make my bread  but the giant's wife once again assured
CzfWPGDAS4g,2510800,2516560,him that he is mistaken  and offered him his huge breakfast to
CzfWPGDAS4g,2516560,2524640,eat  [Music]  after eating his food he asked his wife
CzfWPGDAS4g,2524640,2530160,get me my golden head  the wife got the hen and the giant
CzfWPGDAS4g,2530160,2534280,roared in his voice
CzfWPGDAS4g,2536800,2543920,that very moment the hen laid a golden  egg  and jack was left amazed with what he
CzfWPGDAS4g,2543920,2550720,saw  no sooner he saw the giant slipping into  his deep sleep
CzfWPGDAS4g,2550720,2558319,and once again he came out of the oven  picked up the hen and ran for the door
CzfWPGDAS4g,2558319,2565680,in the meanwhile the hen began to cackle  the voice made the giant move a little
CzfWPGDAS4g,2565680,2571119,but he kept sleeping  jack climbed down the stop and went
CzfWPGDAS4g,2571119,2576240,straight to his mother and gave her the  golden hen  [Music]
CzfWPGDAS4g,2576240,2581520,the mother and the boy was so rich that  they had money greater than even what
CzfWPGDAS4g,2581520,2586800,they could spend  one day he was sitting idle
CzfWPGDAS4g,2586800,2593119,the thought of the beanstalk crossed his  mind again  and he decided to climb it
CzfWPGDAS4g,2593119,2599760,no sooner he was at the castle  but this time he decided not to be seen
CzfWPGDAS4g,2599760,2604839,and climbed the kitchen wall of the  castle and hid himself in the
CzfWPGDAS4g,2604839,2610520,oven in came the giant roaring louder  than ever
CzfWPGDAS4g,2610520,2618359,fifi for fun  i smell the blood of an english
CzfWPGDAS4g,2619860,2623149,[Music]
CzfWPGDAS4g,2625520,2632160,but the giantess was quite sure that she  had seen no little boy that morning and
CzfWPGDAS4g,2632160,2639119,after crumbling a great deal the giant  sat down for breakfast
CzfWPGDAS4g,2639119,2644880,as soon as he got over with his  breakfast he called out to his wife
CzfWPGDAS4g,2644880,2650960,bring me my heart  sing  ordered the giant
CzfWPGDAS4g,2650960,2656880,soon the harp started singing the most  beautiful sounds ever heard and no
CzfWPGDAS4g,2656880,2664160,sooner the giant fell off into his deep  sleep jack who was waiting for this
CzfWPGDAS4g,2664160,2670400,moment got out of the oven and climbed  the table to grab the harp
CzfWPGDAS4g,2670400,2676800,but as soon as he started running off  with it the harp started shouting
CzfWPGDAS4g,2676800,2683040,master master  the giant woke up just in time to catch
CzfWPGDAS4g,2683040,2690240,the sight of jack running out of the  kitchen door  with a fearful roar he saw jack running
CzfWPGDAS4g,2690240,2697920,with the harp and dashed after him  little jack ran as fast as he could
CzfWPGDAS4g,2697920,2706880,while holding the heart tightly in his  hands  the giant taking terribly long strides
CzfWPGDAS4g,2706880,2714480,gained on jack  and he would have been caught if giant  had not slipped over a boulder
CzfWPGDAS4g,2714480,2720560,before he could pick himself up  jack began to climb down the beanstalk
CzfWPGDAS4g,2720560,2727119,and when the giant arrived at the edge  he was nearly halfway to the cottage
CzfWPGDAS4g,2727119,2733680,the giant began to climb down too  but as soon as jack saw him coming he
CzfWPGDAS4g,2733680,2741359,called out  mother bring an axe  the widow hurried out with the chopper
CzfWPGDAS4g,2741359,2749280,jack had no sooner reached the ground  than he cut the beanstalk right in two
CzfWPGDAS4g,2749280,2755920,down came the giant with a terrible  crash  and that you may be sure
CzfWPGDAS4g,2755920,2761930,was the end of him  but the mother had a very important  advice for jai
CzfWPGDAS4g,2761930,2767359,[Music]  jack  what the giant did to your father was
CzfWPGDAS4g,2767359,2775839,bad  but you should not have been so greedy  he raped what he sowed but greed is also
CzfWPGDAS4g,2775839,2784160,a bad deed  jack agreed to his mother and promised  to never be greedy again and they lived
CzfWPGDAS4g,2784160,2792800,happily ever after  tia that was such an adventurous story
CzfWPGDAS4g,2792800,2798240,yeah tofu and do you know why it was my  favorite story
CzfWPGDAS4g,2798240,2803599,no  tell me  the story was about a brave boy who
CzfWPGDAS4g,2803599,2809680,wanted to fight against poverty and in a  way he got a chance to take revenge of
CzfWPGDAS4g,2809680,2817280,his father too  but in the process he forgot that  harming the giant again and again was
CzfWPGDAS4g,2817280,2822880,not ethical and stealing from the  giant's house was also against his
CzfWPGDAS4g,2822880,2828160,morals  oh  that's quite a heavy thought for my
CzfWPGDAS4g,2828160,2835359,little brain  let's go we are late for dinner mom must
