FQ_pn5QFBbk,25890,30880,[Music]  i need everything
FQ_pn5QFBbk,31110,42119,[Music]
FQ_pn5QFBbk,42800,48640,what's up brother how you doing bro you  are not a small welterweight my man  people look at me like dang i don't
FQ_pn5QFBbk,48640,54640,think you're that big yeah you walk down  yeah damn because you can't cause you  you do a lot of like analyst work and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,54640,59760,when you're sitting down i'm like he's  not he has a big head but his body you  know he's like you know you got a head
FQ_pn5QFBbk,59760,64960,on you so it's like he has a big head  but his body but then burst like oh [ __ ]  he's a big ass welterweight yeah i get
FQ_pn5QFBbk,64960,70840,that uh jason herzog tell me that he's  like man when you when i was in the cage  with you i was like man you're thick
FQ_pn5QFBbk,70840,76640,yeah yeah  yeah people underestimate it but that's  when they feel it like they're always  sitting there when they're when they're
FQ_pn5QFBbk,76640,82240,fighting me like they always think that  i'm weaker than i am and then they feel  they're like oh all right you're a lot  stronger than i thought yeah and i guess
FQ_pn5QFBbk,82240,87520,what's interesting about you is you have  so many like fire the night you're  exciting fighter and you've won what 10
FQ_pn5QFBbk,87520,93600,on your last 11 like yeah on a streak  man you know you look at like the wonder  boy fight the damian maya like a lot of
FQ_pn5QFBbk,93600,99360,your fights like you incorporate a ton  of wrestling  so i it makes sense like wrestling's in
FQ_pn5QFBbk,99360,105520,your background but you're not like a  national champion wrestler but you're  out wrestling these dudes at you know  especially wonder boy you talk about
FQ_pn5QFBbk,105520,111119,that wonder boy fight for you it's like  to me when i look at your resume you  look at your career 10 out of 11 you're
FQ_pn5QFBbk,111119,117200,doing the damn thing  you know that wonder boy fight that's  when you want to that's a feather in  your cap because a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,117200,122960,his takedown defense is ridiculous  that's all he focuses on yeah he's all  good on cake boxing you know what i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,122960,128239,saying like his entire camp is just him  against the wall trying not to get taken  down and you just took him down over and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,128239,134080,oh you know 50 45. yeah that was that  was literally probably the one that i  was like all right now i belong here you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,134080,139440,know when you get to those fights you're  like all right i beat damian maya but  then they're like well you know damn is  old you're like all right maybe damien
FQ_pn5QFBbk,139440,144720,is old and then they offer me  wonder boy and i'm like  damn wonder boy and i was like i've been
FQ_pn5QFBbk,144720,150879,in camps with like anthony pettis who  fought him i've been on campus with t  woodley who fought him and they're  bringing in specialist karate guys
FQ_pn5QFBbk,150879,156480,they're bringing in this guy that guy  and i'm sitting there like bro i got  their type of money i ain't and i'm  cheap so i'm like yo i'm going to fly
FQ_pn5QFBbk,156480,162560,somebody in yeah but i'd like you know  what let me let me call up like a stage  north carolina maybe give me a look i  hit him up he's like oh sorry man i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,162560,168400,can't come i can't it's like damn all  right so i guess just me on my own and  my team and i was like well what's the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,168400,174000,way to beat him it's wrestling and it's  going hard and then after i got that  fight it was like fight week and i was
FQ_pn5QFBbk,174000,179680,sitting there like everybody's telling  me i'm gonna get knocked out everybody  tell me he's gonna spin the heel kick  man who's everybody fans you know the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,179680,186080,the cat online yeah and even my manager  hit me up it was like fight week or  manage to hit me off he's like ah  brother man you know i'm excited about
FQ_pn5QFBbk,186080,191840,who's your manager ali  he's like  everybody with that brother you know you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,191840,197680,know what you know we had to take this  fight because you know we had to show  that this top five guys we had to take  it i'm sitting there like all right yeah
FQ_pn5QFBbk,197680,204400,i know i want this fight i know he's  like uh you know but you know what i'm  most proud of proud of is that you know  we got you an analyst job and i'm like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,204400,210159,bro you're talking like i'm about to  lose and yeah  yeah i'm like bro what are you talking
FQ_pn5QFBbk,210159,215599,about i don't like that literally i'm  like  yeah do they really think i'm gonna lose  right now that's how it goes though yeah
FQ_pn5QFBbk,215599,222159,that's how it goes especially when you  fight big names because they have such a  big fan base and they're so well known  like even your manager your friends your
FQ_pn5QFBbk,222159,228239,family your brothers like wonder boy man  because they've seen the head kick and  the spin back kicks and all that [ __ ] so
FQ_pn5QFBbk,228239,234000,that gets planted into your mind but i  think  there's moments in fighter's career and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,234000,241120,even up till then you've beat some  monsters again 1011s in the welterweight  division  in current ufc days is
FQ_pn5QFBbk,241120,247519,nazos it's absolutely nutsos but that  wonderboy fight again when i look at  your resume that's the one and as you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,247519,253920,said like you want to see if you have  what it takes to be those top  echelon guys for me i remember walking
FQ_pn5QFBbk,253920,260079,out they gave me gabriel gonzaga the  time he's ranked in top 10 in the world  i remember walking out going dude if you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,260079,265520,can't beat him let's go get a job  because you're never going to be like a  top if you can't be him yeah like you're
FQ_pn5QFBbk,265520,271919,not  you're just gonna be a god yeah so i  remember walking out and i felt so kind  of relieved i was like yeah that's cool
FQ_pn5QFBbk,271919,279040,now here's the decision you don't beat  him you'll go get another job dude yeah  so for you and i'm not saying get  another job but i think for you like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,279040,284479,that wonder boy fight who remember he's  beat two guys  that beat me he beat you yeah so you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,284479,291759,have that going into it so you have all  in your managers like hey man you know i  put a thousand bucks on wonderboy
FQ_pn5QFBbk,291759,297120,you know what i'm saying so it's like  you have all these things working  against you then you go in there 50 45
FQ_pn5QFBbk,297120,302160,pretty clear yeah you know what i'm  saying so it's like off to the races  after that my man yeah after that one it
FQ_pn5QFBbk,302160,308560,was like all right i belong this is me  and then you know you get you get a  little cocky but then all of a sudden
FQ_pn5QFBbk,308560,313600,the trolls are still there well  wonderboy sucks anyway i wonder where  are you going to wrestle oh daddy you  weren't saying that the weakness
FQ_pn5QFBbk,313600,318800,literally i'm like literally going back  to my comments of the fight week you  can't win that you're going to you're  never going to win those you're never
FQ_pn5QFBbk,318800,325919,going to win those yeah and then like  you listen to like joe rogan like don't  put that negativity in your head stop  reading the comments but i'm like  posting goes brother post i try i try
FQ_pn5QFBbk,325919,331440,but it's like you want to read because  you're like maybe they're going to start  telling good things about you now and  it's like no nothing's ever going to
FQ_pn5QFBbk,331440,337120,yeah because it's their reflection on  you it's like they could never do what
FQ_pn5QFBbk,337120,342800,you do so it's like their like own  insecurities they're lashing out at you  that's why you got to look at it so and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,342800,349600,like think about this before you're  starting ufc career if you're like hmm  i'm going to take a  vote on instagram if they say yes i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,349600,357759,going to pursue the ufc go hey guys do  you think i'll make it as ufc fighter  it'd be like 90 10 like hell no because
FQ_pn5QFBbk,357759,364560,yeah of course not yeah that's why  they're throwing hate your way you know  what i'm saying like you're crushing it  man but 10 out of 11. and then that's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,364560,371440,what i like about your story so you got  wonderboy thompson which has to be a  mind [ __ ] it's like be two guys that you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,371440,378560,lost to yeah you know he's impossible to  train for you have a small camp your  manager is betting against you but you i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,378560,384000,love you but you get it done you get it  done and then they go okay what what  else would be the a bigger mind [ __ ]
FQ_pn5QFBbk,384000,389280,than wonder boy oh let's give him a  vicente luce as the main event a guy you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,389280,396319,lost to was it your second fight yeah  second fight he knocked you out which is  awful like so just meant to get over
FQ_pn5QFBbk,396319,402000,that and not only do you have to get  over that but you're the main event bro  yeah that was the fight where i was
FQ_pn5QFBbk,402000,408400,taking such a hard path i was like man  the ufc hate me i was like they they  have to have to have something to  against me so i'm like you know all
FQ_pn5QFBbk,408400,414000,right you give me maya i'd be my one of  the best grapplers i've ever fought in  the ufc then you give me wonder boy  who's one of the best strikers ever
FQ_pn5QFBbk,414000,419919,fought in the ufc then you're like all  right well i think he got past those two  let me give him somebody that knocked  him out somebody that one of the best
FQ_pn5QFBbk,419919,426160,finishers i think one of the best  finishers in the welterweight division  at all and it was crazy how it came  about because at first they were like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,426160,431440,you're fighting comes that uh main event  in london and i was like  all right let's go book it and i'm you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,431440,437280,know i'm telling my family let's go  we're going to london and then all of a  sudden ali calls me like  ah brother hold up we got an issue and i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,437280,443360,was like well he's like well if you  fight comes out in london then luke and  gilbert are not gonna have fights and  you know they're never gonna fight each
FQ_pn5QFBbk,443360,449360,other and i was like okay and then he's  like  so pick one of the three and i was like  if i'm picking one of the three i want
FQ_pn5QFBbk,449360,455840,comments because you gained the most  from beating a guy like that 100 and i  was like let me get him and he's like  all right all right hold up hold up you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,455840,462720,know what's gonna be you and gilbert  then luke and kamza then i was like  whatever and then he called me again the  next day and he's like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,462720,467840,hey yo it's gonna be you and luke and i  was like how do you keep switching off  why did you even ask me yeah it sounds
FQ_pn5QFBbk,467840,474080,like you had a plan yeah yeah  something you knew before i was gonna  answer yeah yeah i'm like all right  whatever bro let's go and then like you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,474080,480400,said it was still the  you're telling everybody yeah it doesn't  matter it doesn't matter but it's the  guy that knocks you out in it
FQ_pn5QFBbk,480400,485759,and to have a guy that you know puts you  to sleep and you're getting those like  the trolls that are sending the same
FQ_pn5QFBbk,485759,491840,gift every freaking day you know when  you're getting knocked out and you're  like i can't get past it and he's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,491840,497680,yeah that's the other thing is yeah he  beat you but you've both gotten a lot  better but as much as you've gotten
FQ_pn5QFBbk,497680,503520,better vicente luca has gotten a hell of  a lot better too like he's a savage dude  yeah and then
FQ_pn5QFBbk,503520,510879,main event turn ramadan  during ramadan  who is dude hey ufc cut my boy of some
FQ_pn5QFBbk,510879,516719,[ __ ] slack they're like here's  vicente all right you beat wonder boy we  get that impossible match up now here's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,516719,523200,vicente luke again who knocked you out  and we're going to do it during ramadan  and go muhammad you know
FQ_pn5QFBbk,523200,528720,i tell myself that all the time because  i did the maya fight i had to do the  whole canter and i was like never again  i'm not i'm dying this is the last i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,528720,533760,earned it where i don't have to fight  during ramadan again but like i said ali  calls you and he's like all right  they're going gonna do you and luke but
FQ_pn5QFBbk,533760,540320,he didn't give me a date  then i was like all right cool  did he tell you main event he told me  main event and i was like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,540320,545680,yeah somebody says i'm gonna say yeah no  matter what and then all of a sudden  he's like yo it's this day i was like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,545680,551760,well we did it before  and then your coaches are like bro this  is that when you're at top five
FQ_pn5QFBbk,551760,558320,you got to be a little bit smarter now  and i was like bro it's main event and i  was like  i have to take it and then just to get
FQ_pn5QFBbk,558320,564240,that one back otherwise i'm a fighter  too so it's like oh he turned it down so  he's scared of the guy that knocked him
FQ_pn5QFBbk,564240,569519,out yeah no i get both sides yeah i i  wish  your manager in the ufc be a little
FQ_pn5QFBbk,569519,576399,friendlier to you but yeah they're not  doing any favors so again you get past  the wonderboy test you pass the luke a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,576399,582800,test main event and then here we are  here we are and to be honest before he
FQ_pn5QFBbk,582800,589120,came in i called trail sony because i  used to i like to bounce ideas off jail  for the division stuff like that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,589120,595680,you're in a tough position my man the  division's in a tough position because  you've got kamar usman who's you know
FQ_pn5QFBbk,595680,601600,the pound-for-pound goat right now  welterweight you know some i think even  rogan dana said best of all time you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,601600,607279,know it's debate for that i i actually  agree with that but so you have this  goat at the top he has to have hand
FQ_pn5QFBbk,607279,613279,surgery  so we don't know what's going to go on  there he's supposed to fight leon  edwards so you got that right yeah let
FQ_pn5QFBbk,613279,619760,me paint the bakes for you this is how  messy it is so you got the you got uspin  and leon edwards and leon has earned it
FQ_pn5QFBbk,619760,626800,that that poor guy has earned it we have  history with leon to poke you in the eye  so you have leon oozman here and then
FQ_pn5QFBbk,626800,632079,you got over here you got colby and  hamzat two guys that i would love to see
FQ_pn5QFBbk,632079,638320,you fight and we're waiting to see what  happens there the problem there is kobe  got sucker punch and mate might have
FQ_pn5QFBbk,638320,643920,some brain damage from it and a chipped  tooth and there's a lawsuit so we know  what's gonna happen there
FQ_pn5QFBbk,643920,649600,and then here's muhammad you know what  i'm saying it's like  you between the guys who have been
FQ_pn5QFBbk,649600,655360,[ __ ] over the most are you and leon  edwards yeah and that's why i feel like  we deserve to fight each other but like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,655360,660640,when you're when you're looking at it  this way i'm looking at it as all right  usman  he's earned the right to you know heal
FQ_pn5QFBbk,660640,665680,up you fought three times last year you  have an injured hand you don't want to  rush your champion back
FQ_pn5QFBbk,665680,672959,if i'm leon edwards i haven't fought i  fought one time in three years against  nate diaz  and do i want my next fight off of a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,672959,679839,nate diaz fight to be the champion  or do i want to get in the cage and if  you think you're the champion you got to  beat everybody anyway yeah so why not
FQ_pn5QFBbk,679839,685200,fight somebody  and even i'm sure usually would be the  type to be like yo do you enter in title
FQ_pn5QFBbk,685200,693519,that's why i think i'm gonna be out  that's why i think think i think there's  a interim title i think  if colby and hamza fight on abc and was
FQ_pn5QFBbk,693519,698560,that july or august do we know uh i  think that that one's in uh july yeah so
FQ_pn5QFBbk,698560,705680,if they do that abc and they figure out  kobe and hamza i think that fights for  the intern yeah that's what i think
FQ_pn5QFBbk,705680,712000,for me i don't think kobe's going to  take it though i don't think kobe is  going to fight kamza i think  you know like you said i think the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,712000,717920,if he goes to court saying that i'm  accepting a fight then the court's gonna  go yo you're talking about you have  brain damage and we're suing this guy
FQ_pn5QFBbk,717920,724160,you're taking a fight you're taking a  fight how how are you training right now  if you have brain damage  for me like you said i think i'm gonna
FQ_pn5QFBbk,724160,730720,get obviously brushed over if it's  they want comes out to be the next one  to fight so let's you on the nbc like if
FQ_pn5QFBbk,730720,736240,kobe can't give up the lawsuit which i  think you should yeah if cole we can't  give up the lawsuit and he wants to you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,736240,741839,know put his foot in the ground and ride  on that cool  you do you figure that lawsuit out jorge
FQ_pn5QFBbk,741839,747839,and you are out of here yeah so uh ding  ding ding ding mohammed for 5 000 alex
FQ_pn5QFBbk,747839,754000,and literally i make it the easiest ever  i'm sitting there calling on everybody  i'm accepting it and then comes us  another one of that was like we were
FQ_pn5QFBbk,754000,759120,going back and forth on twitter a little  bit and he's like posted a gift of me  getting knocked out by luke interesting  and i'm like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,759120,764720,beautiful all right you do it yeah let's  go yeah you do it let's get it and i  think it makes sense when you're looking
FQ_pn5QFBbk,764720,770639,at the top five in the division  uh gilbert's ready for usman kobe's  ready for usman leon's actually fought
FQ_pn5QFBbk,770639,776000,him already but all right well you give  them that shot but me and kami's are the  only two that are fresh blood that  haven't fought him yet
FQ_pn5QFBbk,776000,781680,and i just beat a guy in luke who was  the  he was going to be the substitute if the  the last time i played that yeah luke
FQ_pn5QFBbk,781680,787200,luke i thought he was going to get a  title shot or be a late replacement like  to fill in there or he thought he was
FQ_pn5QFBbk,787200,794160,going to get like a nate diaz fight  that's what he when he was on food truck  and that's all he's campaigning okay  yeah yeah and it made sense because his
FQ_pn5QFBbk,794160,801279,streak was so so much so like all right  well i take his juice now since i just  beat him yep so i think ali hired that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,801279,807120,uh  dump truck to interrupt this interview  ollie be cool man
FQ_pn5QFBbk,807120,812160,well so we're continuous let me feed you  some mexican egg rolls
FQ_pn5QFBbk,812160,818480,because you don't have a fight coming up  yet so we can't eat so let me feed you  these mixing egg rolls hopefully they're  good we'll continue this let's go eat my
FQ_pn5QFBbk,818480,824720,man  i need a thick girl
FQ_pn5QFBbk,825440,829000,i need a dick
FQ_pn5QFBbk,835120,842160,i'm good man thanks for doing this  uh  uh mexican egg rolls correct
FQ_pn5QFBbk,842160,847199,it's it's just like uh it's just it's  it's a natural but we're just filling  them up with mexican food would it be
FQ_pn5QFBbk,847199,854639,like a deep fried mini burrito right uh  kind of like a chimichanga just not flat  oh gotcha right got round though right
FQ_pn5QFBbk,854639,861199,what do you what do you recommend  everything we put on there is good man i  mean everything we make if we want to  eat ourselves it wouldn't be in our menu
FQ_pn5QFBbk,861199,866320,makes sense  what are you thinking man they have this  in chicago no no never heard of mexican
FQ_pn5QFBbk,866320,871600,grill yeah but we do have great mexican  food in chicago yeah yeah chicago has  great food yeah pizza is overrated
FQ_pn5QFBbk,871600,877440,though right am i right am i right a  little bit i'm a thin crust pizza anyway  oh it's about the deep dish we have
FQ_pn5QFBbk,877440,882639,great thin crust spots in chicago that  are really good yeah but we just don't  get the credit because everybody thinks

FQ_pn5QFBbk,1228480,1234400,yeah you guys have great steakhouses  yeah and it's one of those where you get  to the point where  i had the point where i was like eating
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1234400,1240159,out literally probably like four times a  week after a fight because you're like  you're celebrating  and you look at your bank account
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1240159,1246720,statement it's like bro i spent like  a thousand dollars this month this time  yeah and then for my culture it's like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1246720,1252159,if we're eating out i'm gonna pay for  the meal like if i invite you out and  it's always like that and you're like i  yo these meals are starting to get six
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1252159,1257360,hundred dollars yeah i think you gotta  start going split build on this it's not  it's not even in my culture but i think
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1257360,1263280,it's a culture of fame you get a little  bit of fame everyone's like oh brendan  has this i'm like i guess yeah yeah
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1263280,1269280,and he gets it out yeah he gets to that  aggro point where he's like  but ninety percent of the people i hang  out with they're all like oh no let's go
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1269280,1274480,let's play it let's play it it's me it's  me it's me it's not like they're not  pushing it on me i'm never gonna let
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1274480,1280480,yeah i'm never gonna let them take it  over me  no because you i mean you surrounded you  came up with what three brothers uh yeah

FQ_pn5QFBbk,1286559,1291919,so you got how many older brothers am i  my i got one older brother and older  sister and then two younger brothers oh
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1291919,1297840,dope yeah and they're huge fans i'm sure  of what you do yeah yeah my brother's  the  they're the ones that like my older
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1297840,1304559,brother want to like push me through it  to do it more than anything like even  when i was in college like he bought my  first car for me he was like oh you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1304559,1311039,don't need to work do this do that yeah  yeah he was like giving me money  whenever i needed it and then uh
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1311039,1317600,you know even with my cousins i had  cousins where i worked in their store  and they'll like set up the schedule for  me where i could go train so like i  worked the morning shift from like nine
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1317600,1324000,to four  because they know the vision yeah and  they see it and they see that i'm  dedicated and they wanna they want some  they want me to get out like even when i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1324000,1329919,went to school because i went to college  and it was always like be different you  know 90 of the people that i know it's  like right when you finish high school
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1329919,1335440,it's like i could work in the store i  could work in a business get paid cash  and then that's what everybody does you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1335440,1341120,open up your own business you build your  own money then you open up your own  store everybody does that everybody  thought that it was never about school
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1341120,1346400,but but  i'm sure obviously have the support but  did everybody think you were going to be
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1346400,1352720,this damn good you know 10 out of 11  what's great division 2 on 22 and then  also number five in the world like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1352720,1359600,you're  either your next fight is for an interim  title or you're one fight away from  fighting for a world title like that's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1359600,1365200,the only way i see it  my older brother was uh  the type right when i got into the ufc
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1365200,1370880,like give us matt brown give us carlos  connor tom stop  doing that to you and my coach like bro
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1370880,1376559,we gotta build up no no he'll kill all  of them and he's like telling me that  i'm like bro shut up this is a freaking  crowd it doesn't work like that yeah i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1376559,1382000,like bro i don't know what you want me  to do  yeah and then it's brothers though you  know yeah my brother's my brother's my
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1382000,1388720,uh uh tour road manager oh okay it's the  same thing yeah so he's always telling  me that but then like you know you have
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1388720,1393760,those people around you that you know  are like  hiding behind the scenes haters where
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1393760,1399280,like they don't message you or say  anything to you but then it'll be like  after you win the place like oh they'll  post about you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1399280,1404559,my uncle there's nothing worse after my  first fight uncle was like  after i won my first fight he was like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1404559,1411200,oh well  if you lose the rest of your fights at  least you could say you won one in the  ufc okay that's not where we're going
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1411200,1418320,i was like  it was like right after the win he's  like at least you gotta win huh and i  was like such a hater and i was like bro
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1418320,1424240,and then now like we don't like we  barely talk but i'm like yeah you know  well you know i know you're a hater from  the beginning yeah they're either haters
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1424240,1429360,they just don't understand like after i  did my first special on showtime my dad  didn't come it's a big deal and then the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1429360,1436000,next morning my dad calls me goes how'd  your speech go  all right well that's where we're at man  he apologized for that now i want that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1436000,1441520,on record he didn't apologize really but  yeah i think uh  you need that support and for you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1441520,1447279,especially the level you're at now you  know top five  again we're talking about before we got  these
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1447279,1453039,egg roll mexican food where it's like  the the  the division's kind of it's in a weird
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1453039,1460240,place man because  camaro and leon edwards supposed to  fight colby and hamza supposed to fight
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1460240,1466080,potentially so let's say that happens  what do we do with muhammad you know  what i'm saying like then what happens
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1466080,1472080,if if those  four fighters yeah that happens where  are you at you know what i'm saying like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1472080,1477120,yeah i mean  that literally leaves me on the outside  but then  for me
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1477120,1484799,i'm a guy that's all right well if i  have to i know they never wanted to hand  me anything so if i have to go up five  four three two one four is gilbert burns
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1484799,1490799,and  you know i don't think he really lost  any stock from uh beating comes i mean  losing the comments uh
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1490799,1497520,i could i thought it could have went  either way so like if i have to go to  four three two one i'm like all right  let's go what about if they offer you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1497520,1503279,someone who's not ranked in top five  like a  like a like a  sean brady or something like that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1503279,1508559,for me i wouldn't do that because it's  like you get to this point right now  where  i had to call my way to this level right
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1508559,1514720,now and it's like have you ever yeah and  then leon edwards man yeah you you boys  man you deserve it all yeah and i'm like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1514720,1520559,bro it's not like i was handed anything  there's guys that come to the ufc they  went two fights like it comes out and  then they're at the top right away or
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1520559,1526240,like they're they're superstar right  away for me i was like bro i had to go  through the valleys the highs the lows
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1526240,1533120,and  you guys didn't help build me like i  built myself up and even with my  for for myself is like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1533120,1538559,i started a podcast i did this and then  it's like all right you know my manager  stuff got me the spot as an analyst but
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1538559,1544960,like you know i still earned that spot i  still got there it had to be good to be  an analyst 100 like for everything i did  i like i worked hard for every little
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1544960,1550559,spot i have so i'm like i'm not going to  sit there and just give it away or just  go take a step backwards
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1550559,1555679,yeah it's not worth the risk like you  work too hard to risk what you've built  on that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1555679,1561279,it's a good fight but you know  it has to be top five it's just  sometimes it's just the timing the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1561279,1567840,division which i would hate to see that  for you but then also when you talk  about you've earned it like  you know i i think too if i'm the ufc
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1567840,1574159,and i don't know how their meetings go  down they kicked me a long time ago but  i think if they have their meetings  you know you're a guy who speaks well
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1574159,1580720,right you just train your ass off you're  a good person so it's like  your history is something they can  really market but then also like you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1580720,1586799,know how hard it is to be to get an  analyst job in the ufc right like  everybody wants that job yeah everybody
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1586799,1593679,man so for you to even be in the  rotation i mean you look at the guys who  are trying to get in there like it's a b  you have to be a real special skill set
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1593679,1600240,man yeah and man it's a lot harder than  people think people think it's a lot  easier i'm like bro this is this is hard  and then i'm like a perfectionist so i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1600240,1605760,sitting there still thinking about man i  should have said this when it's like  that from like three weeks ago yeah and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1605760,1612240,i'm like looking up like broadcasting  schools and stuff like that because  it takes practice and it gets you know  it's it's different to be in front of a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1612240,1619279,camera and stuff like that but what  helps you is uh how long have you been  doing your podcast which is good yeah  about uh two years now two yeah so just
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1619279,1626559,getting the the reps on that podcast  just to filter out like and flush ideas  out and engage and then also on podcasts
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1626559,1631600,like  like probably the toughest like lifting  job i have is cal best fight campaign
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1631600,1637520,you know it can be a three hour show  yeah so it's like that dead air you get  used to like filling that nobody's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1637520,1643120,better in the world than joe rogan  really i got buddies who are going to go  on like man where are we going to talk  about like trust me dude you don't have
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1643120,1649039,to worry about it yeah let the captain  take the ship he'll he'll never have  that dead silence like you just from do
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1649039,1654960,it from 10 for ten thousand hours they  always got some tools man yeah you know  so for you that you have such an
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1654960,1660320,advantage because you're able to do that  podcast yeah and for like john when john  had first brought it to me he was like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1660320,1667039,always oh you got it we had to do a  podcast we got to do a podcast he's like  i want you to do with my brother jason  such a cool dude uh and then i was like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1667039,1672320,you know i don't want to do just like a  normal podcast i want to be different  because everybody has like their own  podcast or anything so that's why i made
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1672320,1677919,it like a game show yeah uh so i had  like the game show aspect of it where  it's like if we do have that dead area  like yo all right let's start this game
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1677919,1683520,show i feel like it opens up fighters  too where even with you where it's  something different where it's like yo  we're eating now we're just normally
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1683520,1689679,talking instead of like all right so how  was the fight camp type interviews like  that how do you feel blah blah blah and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1689679,1695919,that that's my thing on this show like  um when i started show creators show i  i'm not a i think people get twisted i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1695919,1702799,not a journalist i'm not an expert i'm  just i have a background in fighting and  i know like what it takes to go through
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1702799,1709440,it  but this show like i'm not breaking news  you know what i'm saying like i'm not  trying to get the story so like if you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1709440,1714640,came on here and you're like hey man uh  i want to talk about chicago pizza for  an hour like let's talk about chicago
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1714640,1720480,pizza yeah i don't i'm interested in  what you can do fighting but if you told  me before it's like hey man i don't
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1720480,1726559,really wanna talk about like cool let's  talk about kanye west for an hour i  don't give a [ __ ] you know what i'm  saying like there's no agenda here
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1726559,1732799,that's just different about it yeah yeah  so it can go wherever you know  but yeah to that point i i think you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1732799,1738720,bring a lot to the table and ali knows  that you know he's a smart smart he's  one of the best in the game i love ali
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1738720,1745039,he's a good dude he's a smart dude so  it's like you that you know ave won 10  out of 11. b you can talk your ass off
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1745039,1750640,you're not an idiot so you like you  represent the sport good and as far as  you know whatever happens in your fight
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1750640,1757679,career like this analyst stuff man you  know it's tough group to get in but you  can do it yeah you look at you look at a

FQ_pn5QFBbk,1838799,1845120,what i'm saying yeah so you know he's  focused on this you know so for you do  you feel like it's  it gets pulling you a little bit it gets
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1845120,1850159,a little bit when uh finding guests  because that like i don't know that's  the first i don't know nobody i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1850159,1856640,literally slide into dms  24 7. i don't care if like you you  turned me down or anything did you slide  into mine dude i think i said it's your
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1856640,1862480,df god damn i was like and i was like  i literally slid into everybody's dms
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1862480,1869679,and that's the way i get it you know  i'll have like i've had huge names i'm  not sure i had paul fell down my show i  had chris wyman frankie edgar uh darren
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1869679,1876000,till so like i've had those guys on my  show but then you'll get people on like  on twitter oh ali probably got him those  guys and i'm like bro like i was sliding
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1876000,1881919,your dms if you don't respond to my  damns i go in your comments hey yo could  you come on my podcast and that's how i  got chidoverra oh
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1881919,1888480,[ __ ] like didn't respond to my dm but he  responded to my comment she's the best  and i just got karate hottie uh last  week where she's like it was like a year
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1888480,1893679,later  it was like a year later she's like oh  i'm sorry i just saw this she's all i'm  in you're like yeah last three years
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1893679,1899360,literally i was like bro all right well  you're you're in so i'll take it but i  was like yo this is like a year ago
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1899360,1905519,there's that's the worst part i don't  think people understand like when you  have a especially what i like after so  many guests on all the shows it's the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1905519,1910559,worst part of the game yeah it's not the  one and then if for the reason like  thank god on my level now where i have
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1910559,1916240,people that book guys you know but in  general like sometimes it comes down to  me and i'm like hey man do you mind like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1916240,1922559,you just like [ __ ] yeah away from  people's schedule and [ __ ] you know for  you i think it's gonna be easier for you  because you're at this level now but i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1922559,1927600,like bro it's a beast man yeah it's hard  and i'm like  and we like it'll be like thursday my
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1927600,1933919,show's on thursday and i won't have a  guess and i made the game show myself i  like literally do like face mashes and  stuff like that of uh like filters and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1933919,1940159,like funny stuff like that and i haven't  done that editing yeah i'm doing that  yeah i'm doing all of that and i'm like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1940159,1946559,all right we ain't got no guts yet so  i'll literally slide into a million dm's  at one time then there'll be times where  i like have four people respond at one
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1946559,1952720,time and i'm like all right we're going  four people on the show oh damn instead  of like wasting it bank them yeah yeah  instead of like wasting them so i'm like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1952720,1959279,bro  and it's cool because like every time  somebody comes on and they they're done  they're always like messing me up yo  that was a great thing great show it's a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1959279,1964799,different show and then having like i  had chelsea on his show and he's like  genius and like just getting those  messages makes you like feels happy
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1964799,1970000,about it when you have guys at that  level tell you that yeah i think the for  me it's like you and i haven't met
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1970000,1975039,before i've always been a fan i became a  fan  i knew you're a monster fighter i became
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1975039,1980080,a fan when you start doing the the desk  gig  let's do smart i'm main man like i dig
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1980080,1985200,that because nobody can do that but then  with your fighting  the problem with this show is because
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1985200,1991600,you and i are be boys now so i'll root  for you the problem is when you fight a  guy like colby i'm boys
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1991600,1997360,like i love the vicente lucas i love  this he's like the nicest guy in the  world so it's like once guys are on the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,1997360,2002960,show and i create a relationship with  them and then if you guys have to fight  i'm like oh [ __ ] and then i go on my
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2002960,2009200,shop show that you know they forced me  to make preparations  and you'll see like  especially like your next fight if you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2009200,2014720,fight somebody i know i'll just skate  right in the middle really yeah you know  i think muhammad gots this one but if
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2014720,2020080,you know it's like i don't want to piss  anybody off yeah it's like a tough gig  it's fine for me because i do like i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2020080,2025279,circle picks for every week  yeah like it got to the point where fans  now are always like what are your picks
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2025279,2031279,this week and i do the whole card and  then uh ali like had like a  uh you know a big thing where all of his
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2031279,2036399,fighters were on the uh he brought them  all out to vegas for like an event with  like uh interviews and stuff like that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2036399,2041679,and then i forgot what his name was some  big russian heavyweight like walked up  to me he's like you know circled me my
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2041679,2047080,last fight and i was like i don't even  know you look at my pics
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2047360,2053200,yeah so now i'm like look at that like  fighters are paying attention to it and  then like i had uh gigan jacassi like  came up to me he said how come you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2053200,2058560,didn't circle my teammate and i was like  bro i don't know i had to be here yeah i  don't even know you like that yeah  there's a lot of pressure but i know you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2058560,2066158,now and i'm like bro all right there's a  reason why certain guys in the business  don't make picks yeah because they don't  want the backlash for me it's like ah
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2066158,2073040,sorry man it's a draftings thing like i  have to do it yeah yeah it's no shade  dude it's it's all it gets hard and then
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2073040,2079280,especially if you're like you start  knowing people or you meet somebody and  then you know it's a terrible matchup  for them and i was like well i gotta i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2079280,2084398,picking i always have my uncle well nice  to meet like yo are these real pics are  you picking with your heart or are these
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2084398,2091919,guys your friends i'm like yeah these  are heart picks it's not my head picks  right now i tell people all the time no  never bet on my picks because i i i i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2091919,2097920,pick with my heart never if it was my  brain people are going to hate me  because you want me to break it down  because then you know you got to break
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2097920,2103680,down their losses and like footwork and  mechanics like i don't like doing that i  just tell people you know i'll do the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2103680,2109119,draftkings read and stuff but don't  listen to my picks man i think guys that  i have relationships with and you know
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2109119,2114320,yeah that's the i mean but like when i  get to the point now where i'm at the  level where every week it's like what
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2114320,2120160,are your picks what do you think and  then when you start making those picks  out of those and you're they're wrong  you're like bro i had like three bad
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2120160,2127200,weeks in a row but i'm like bro i'm  picking all the fights like there's like  12 fights and then  you you your picks suck but then you get
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2127200,2132960,like  funny guys like college wrestlers and  stuff that'll message me like bro your  picks have been losing me money
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2132960,2139839,i'm like i'm glad you guys are all  paying attention though yeah it's funny  because it's just like so surprising  when you get those  messages or somebody from like a comment
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2139839,2145839,from somebody big like oh this guy who's  this guy i don't know this guy even  follows me or he checks me out so it's  like cool yeah yeah there's pressure
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2145839,2151520,with the pigs yeah you gotta get dicey  with that so for you  we're talking a little bit off air about
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2151520,2157680,it for you as far as your next fight  it's kind of i almost and don't take  this wrong with no distract it's almost
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2157680,2164800,i mean it's a common theme in prayer  it's almost not up to you  you know what i'm saying like you're at  the mercy of this weird
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2164800,2170320,four-man tournament going on upstairs  you know what i'm saying above you still  then it's like you're at five
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2170320,2175839,yeah that's the  and for me like i understand it and it's  like like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2175839,2181280,i understand the business part of it i'm  like obviously comes that's the biggest  name and you want to get him
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2181280,2186880,the the biggest fight so if there's an  enter in fight i feel like they're going  to try to give it to him  and it's like i'm not going to sit there
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2186880,2192000,and go online and like pout about it you  don't want to bash him but is there a  part of you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2192000,2199040,you know obviously he didn't take the  same road that you took like you took a  different path and it was probably like  dude come on man yeah it's you know
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2199040,2205040,that's my part and then because i had a  million people come up to me too where i  would call them on twitter and they'd be  like how are you going to call out
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2205040,2210560,another muslim and i'm like bro it's not  about muslim against muslims it's like  yeah that's not yeah we're not about
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2210560,2216400,religion this is about he wants it i  want it too so i like if we're if i see  him at the moment you know hey what's up
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2216400,2222320,how are you doing blah blah blah we're  fighting we're fighting and it's like  it's a professional sport so when i tell
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2222320,2228480,people that yo we both want the same  thing we're both grinding for the same  thing like you said  i you know you had that mentality like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2228480,2233839,oh man how come this guy got it so easy  or how come this guy's blown up he only  has three fights and he's already number
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2233839,2240000,two in the world how come they gave him  that for 21. i've been asking for the  opportunity forever yeah but it's like  where are you at on that it's like i had
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2240000,2246000,to mentally like tell myself like yo  there's a path for everything and like  being a religious guy it's like god's  plan is
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2246000,2251760,his plan his plan is bigger than your  plan and that's how i see it now yeah my  plan is different i also think guys this
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2251760,2258320,advice i'd give you and you know i've  been through some [ __ ] if you put energy  into that  you're going to lose focus on what
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2258320,2264560,really matters like  all right they want to dana and those  guys want to build up bombs out that's  their guy right now cool man you can't
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2264560,2269599,control that yeah you can't control  anything so anything i can control i  don't put any energy in yeah i'm trying
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2269599,2274800,to do my [ __ ] over here this takes so  much effort and focus all right i can't  control that i'm gonna focus over here
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2274800,2280560,yeah and that's like the beautiful thing  about having other things to do where  you're not getting stressed out about it  you're not waiting at home like oh
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2280560,2286320,what's next what's next what's next  you're like all right well i can do this  right now i can stay busy with this or  like i'm trying to get into other
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2286320,2293040,businesses as well where it's like i  don't have to sit there and focus like  man when is the ufc going to call me i  need that check at this moment otherwise
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2293040,2298079,i can't eat and it's like well if you  guys want to do that i'll wait for  something better to come along yeah what
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2298079,2305040,i love about you is like you know if you  look at like uh sugar shawn or uh patty  pimlet like those guys make more money
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2305040,2310800,you know off  you know the stuff they do on social  media or parents just yeah you know than  they do fighting knock on with you i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2310800,2317760,don't see you getting on twitch and  playing video games like yeah for you  you're more of a businessman yeah yeah i  think it's going to be a entrepreneurial
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2317760,2323839,kind of vision for you yeah and that's  like i think that was just the way i was  raised where i said like  my dad's had his own business my
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2323839,2329680,brothers had their own business my  cousins all had like their own business  and it's  that's that was always like the path so
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2329680,2334720,like for me now it's like all right well  i know i'm capable of doing that so
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2334720,2339839,i had three brothers so like we're now  trying to build an empire like yes let's  do this this and this and then i don't
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2339839,2345040,even have to be in charge of this like  i'm getting money now where you're  associated with it yeah where i i you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2345040,2351040,guys should do it show it to me what you  guys want to do and we'll build it  together and obviously i could use my  name on it or whatever like that but
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2351040,2357440,we have the money now now when i was  younger it was like well we need to do  this we need to work for this person or  that person and you know your mom's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2357440,2363839,always telling you go to school they  like immigrant moms think that school is  what's what you what's needed that's how  you're successful if you graduate from
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2363839,2369680,college and that's the only way to be  successful so it's like now we can do  that without that yeah and we could show  that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2369680,2375760,it's not like anything's possible if you  just grind it yeah i think with like  athletes or
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2375760,2382160,i'll why use athletes for example but  it's like uh like you look at the  ufc career it's like dude that's such a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2382160,2387359,short time in your life man so it's like  guys like oh i was too focused on  fighting i couldn't do this other stuff
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2387359,2393839,it's like man that's such a that's a  chapter a small chapter in your life and  guys get so attached to being labeled
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2393839,2400000,ufc fighter it's like that's just  something you do man like that that's  not your identity like if if you if that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2400000,2405920,was just your identity you're not doing  your podcast and looking at these other  businesses so it's like this ufc right
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2405920,2411440,now is taking your focus on your energy  and you're crushing it but  okay like this is gonna be such a short
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2411440,2418560,chapter in your life like those  businesses and you have kids and all  that [ __ ] like that's the story that's  your life ufc is a cool experience
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2418560,2424079,that's why i look at it like i guess if  you're like uh you know a gsp or  something around for [ __ ] ever like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2424079,2429440,that's different this is a whole book  for the majority guys even if you're  there for six seven eight years like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2429440,2435119,eight years that's such a short chapter  dude yeah  and like you said i think a lot of guys
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2435119,2441359,don't understand it and they're like and  even when they lose a fight it hurts  them so hard because there's like that's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2441359,2447040,i need it that's it what do i do now but  this is this is what goes back to your  roots like your family instilled that in
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2447040,2452960,you you know what i'm saying like you  know like you see the work ethic your  dad has your brothers so you it's like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2452960,2458240,you know you've seen them put the plan  together in the discipline and be  successful at that you're like oh that's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2458240,2463440,how that works all right i'll get there  you know what i'm saying like that's  always there for you yeah that's all  that's your mom and dad shout out to
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2463440,2469119,your mom and dad yeah shout out to them  and now shout out to mama even for like  one guy i get that all the time like how
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2469119,2475440,do you make it to the ufc or how do you  do this how do you and i'm telling  people like bro don't think that  fighting is gonna be an easy path like i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2475440,2481920,had my coach lewis taylor uh we've been  together since high school he was uh my  high school wrestling coach and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2481920,2486960,he was literally knocking everybody out  he had like i think a 15 fight winning  streak of all first round finishes
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2486960,2493200,mm-hmm and mma never got a shot in the  ufc but he was like 40 years old and  then i was sitting there you know he's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2493200,2500240,my mentor so i'm looking at like  this guy's knocking people out he's not  getting a shot in the ufc how am i gonna  get my shot in the ufc if he's not gonna
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2500240,2505280,get shot and then you know he finally  gets his call with the pfl  the first uh tournament for the million
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2505280,2510720,dollars  still 42 years old now and it's like  he's won his first fight when's the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2510720,2516480,second fight he goes against the russian  in the finals knocks him out in 30  seconds wins a million dollars oh damn  yeah he was the first middleweight
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2516480,2521760,champion for piano yeah he was a fruit  like i said it was like he has like kind  of like the yo romero body where it's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2521760,2527839,like  he doesn't lift any weights but he just  like jacked jack this heck and like  would walk around at like 189 pounds
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2527839,2533520,wouldn't have to cut weight  yeah just strong  want to have a seat  literally i'm like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2533520,2538880,every time we get we're going out  because i got you with a lot of mexican  guys they'll look at him like oh you're  going to choose me yeah he's like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2538880,2544720,nothing what are you talking about  he just literally just started older  yeah he started older so how did him pf
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2544720,2550160,you became the ps4  shot did he get a ufc shot  that was the last fight and uh so he
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2550160,2556560,retired undefeated world champion yeah  no well he lost uh he's lost like two or  three fights but he retired in pfl
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2556560,2563280,middleweight champion uh that was his  last fight his whole family was there at  that square garden oh my god yeah and  it's like you want man when he was
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2563280,2569359,telling me that all the time people were  like bro you gotta you want a million  dollars in 30 seconds no i want a  million dollars in 12 years
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2569359,2574880,grinding where i like i had moments  where i didn't think i was gonna make it  and you know getting paid a thousand and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2574880,2581599,a thousand trying to support my family  but it was all about the dream it was  all about the grinding and it's like  real champion if you're not willing to
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2581599,2587760,have that mentality oh i don't care what  it what it takes to get there i'm going  to take it so like  seeing his story is like the craziest
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2587760,2592880,thing ever because that's dope man yeah  sounds like a good dude yeah you're sure  the this is the other common theme with
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2592880,2599680,you as you're talking you're surrounded  by great people yeah yeah yeah like  people that are in your country they  really care a small team yeah i've had
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2599680,2606240,gems i've been to gyms where like you  lose the fight  they're not sitting and knocking at your  door they don't really care they're like  not the focus anymore yeah they're all
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2606240,2611280,right we'll move on to the next super  next guy yeah and it's hard  you're like man who's who's with me when
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2611280,2618240,i lose yeah because those are the ones  that really matter those are the people  and that's your family or like your  close close friends that really like how
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2618240,2623359,you feeling today's three days later and  the world's telling you you suck yes but
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2623359,2628960,doesn't want to settle next to you like  yeah man yeah i think and for you like  this long journey you've taken to get to
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2628960,2636240,number five in the world your next fight  is either a title eliminator you know  i'm saying that you're like one fight  maybe you're right [ __ ] there for
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2636240,2641760,you've taken the perfect path and you  have the perfect kind of  not to shame like entourage around you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2641760,2647280,like the perfect team around you to get  this done it's just they just have to  find
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2647280,2652400,like you're you're this puzzle piece  that they need to  figure out you know what i'm saying yeah
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2652400,2658160,and and the people that suffer from this  whole  weird welterweight puzzle is you and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2658160,2665200,leon edwards i think yeah i think so too  so like you could  do that rematch and then you get poked
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2665200,2670560,in the eye yeah i gotta be honest i and  again i love both of you guys i don't  know leon personally i think
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2670560,2676400,technical wise there's there's  it would be tough to find better right  now in the water division like his  techniques
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2676400,2681839,yes and people i respect like josh  thompson like dude i'm telling you this  kid is the real he's been saying it
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2681839,2688480,forever and i respect josh right  but i i don't know like that fight you  and him if it happens great if that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2688480,2694000,works for you yeah i'm just not excited  for it i want you to get homs i want you  to get colby i don't get gusman
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2694000,2700160,obviously that's the thing that's the  hard part because nowadays it's about  like what's going to get you the most  shine or what's going to get the fans
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2700160,2705599,most riled up you know leon obviously is  a great fighter and fighters know how  good he is phenomenal but like the fans
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2705599,2710880,don't really know him because he doesn't  post anything it doesn't go on social  media crazy anything like that and the  one time that you know with the nate
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2710880,2716880,diaz fight like he's winning  he win the fight every second if i  except for the last three seconds it's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2716880,2722640,clipped yeah and then the narrative  because nate diaz fan base is so big  there was like bro if this was a stream
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2722640,2729359,fight yeah this thing's over it's like  wait what but it's not this this was  inside doctor on a professional sport he
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2729359,2734400,lost every single round dude i tell  people like i was like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2734400,2740240,yeah  i'm like yo they're trying they're  basically put on a silver platter yo  beating ideas steal his fans and then
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2740240,2746400,like you said you get rocked and they're  like seconds thirty years oh my god leon  that poor guy dude i said i'm like bro
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2746400,2752319,if he has the title for to get used to  something's gonna happen he's gonna trip  over the freaking wires as he's walking  out
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2752319,2757839,like literally has the worst luck such a  shame man yeah yeah so it's like that  could possibly happen for you and it's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2757839,2763760,like that doesn't happen i don't know  dude i don't know at least you're in a  good spot though yeah i mean for me i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2763760,2770720,think comes out makes the most sense at  everybody like  even if you want to play the muslim  cardio two muslim fighters headline a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2770720,2776160,card abu dhabi  i think that'll be huge and it's a great  idea
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2776160,2781359,has he said anything about the light  we've gone back and forth on twitter  before and you know now i think he's at
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2781359,2787680,the level now where he probably has  people tweeting for him because it's  like let me post the title fight or let  me just post the title or let me post
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2787680,2793359,like  ah the wolf is coming you know with the  nate diaz and the conor mcgregor  they won't tweet nothing forever then
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2793359,2798800,they'll just tweet something and the  fans go what does he mean by this what's  going on yeah and i'm like bro conor  mcgregor's not even in a testing pool i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2798800,2805359,don't think he's gonna fight yeah this  year so for you to think that this tweet  means something it's just like i want  attention it's like i'm bored right now
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2805359,2810960,i'm chilling at home let me get the fans  riled up and i think that comes up to  that level now too where he's like let  me just tweet something to get fans
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2810960,2816240,talking and when when you watch the  hamza gilbert burns fight what was your  takeaway
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2816240,2821520,i saw i saw weaknesses and i saw that  you know  obviously people are like oh man he's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2821520,2827440,he's not as good as we thought he was  but i'm like yo he showed that he has a  chin he showed that he got power and  it's like you're fighting gilbert burns
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2827440,2833440,he's a dog yeah i'm like i picked them i  circled the other burns and i had so  many people like you're a liar you don't  even think everybody's gonna win you're
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2833440,2840079,just picking him because he's with ali  and i'm like bro gilbert is number two  in the world why do you think that he's  just gonna walk through gilbert burns
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2840079,2846240,obviously you know he had what a five  first round finishes whatever and savage  yeah he's he's obviously good but i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2846240,2851760,like bro  what was he 11 13 11 the number was  what's his giveaway time two two yeah
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2851760,2859440,it's a dude that's such a big jump yeah  like though you top five guys like it's  such a different animal and i think
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2859440,2865520,uh nobody was higher on homs that i was  just like dude this guy's insane yeah  he's the next coming of you know gs this
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2865520,2872800,guy's a monster  and then i saw that  it's i i don't think his stock went down
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2872800,2880319,my takeaway was he didn't listen his  coaches he did what he thought he could  do which like get into brag in a war no
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2880319,2885440,game plan he still passed the test  but now the caveat on that is if hamza
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2885440,2892240,doesn't learn from that like you got  lucky yeah like if that was anybody else  you you have taken an l so i think his
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2892240,2898319,team and he has some phenomenal coaches  hamzad has to go in going all right i  can't just keep shooting from the hip i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2898319,2904400,have to stick to a game plan so if he  does get you he gets colby or something  like that it there has to be a game plan
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2904400,2912400,there has to be execution of the game  plan or he's going to lose yeah yeah and  i think i think he has the dog he has  the talent but you do 11 to 2 is such a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2912400,2917760,big jump and when you get to that i  think when people don't understand it  when you get the top five if you're not
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2917760,2923280,you know fighting with the strategy  you're gonna lose to the good guys for  me i think that these last three fights
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2923280,2929680,i've showed that i could fight with a  strategy because they're all different  fighters i thought damien maya who's i  had to stay up on my feet i cannot get
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2929680,2935520,taken down so it's all defensive  wrestling then i fought wonder boy who's  like i'm not going to kickbox with a  wonderboy so i'm going to go in there
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2935520,2941440,and take one boy down he's not easy to  take down yeah not a guy easy to take  down and i don't have college wrestling  i'm not a division 1 wrestler but fight
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2941440,2948240,with a strategy yep and i dominated him  more than anybody else has ever  dominated him then you fight a guy like  luke who's knocked me out who has the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2948240,2954319,most finishes in welterweight savage and  you're like he's good on his feet and  good on the ground how are you gonna be  the guy like that oh well with movement
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2954319,2960000,footwork and then shooting in when he  least expects it when he thinks you're  gonna wrestle you shoot uh you strike  when he thinks you're gonna strike you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2960000,2965680,shoot yeah being smart man yeah and i  did that so like i showed that i could  be a different fighter in every single
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2965680,2971520,fight and i think that comes that's  teams looking at that like bruh you know  what let's look for somebody else at
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2971520,2976559,this moment let's not try to jump on  that because if kobe's out and i'm  willing to fight you we can fight in
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2976559,2982480,june we can fight in july i'm i'm ready  to go yep why aren't you guys willing to  step up that quick so i think it's more
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2982480,2987599,so like coach yeah you know let's let's  wait and see let's let's check this out  first
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2987599,2994079,yeah again he's in a he's in a good spot  don't get around because he's in a  different spot than you just because you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,2994079,3000880,have you have the experience you've been  through the grind you've been to  implement different game plans and beat  guys that you know who are specialists
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3000880,3008559,in one thing and you're able to strike  this one wrestle this one and for him  it's like he hasn't gone through that  process so as much as i think a lot
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3008559,3013839,against the division envy him i don't  because it's same thing happened with  darren till it's like when you get to
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3013839,3019119,the top there's really nowhere to go my  man yeah you just beat the number two  guy but we can't give you number eight
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3019119,3025040,can't give you number nine it's gonna be  one of the top five guys and these guys  have been through hell man so you might
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3025040,3031599,fancy yourself a brawler you can't brawl  they're not gonna brawl with you you're  not gonna have an opportunity in any  faster to browse them finish yourself a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3031599,3037040,wrestler  these guys can wrestle you know so it's  like for him he has to learn
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3037040,3043440,on the go and you're in the top five so  i don't envy that i think he can pass  the test and he has a good he has the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3043440,3050400,skills do it in the talent to do it i  think he will be a he's a monster right  now but i just think to live up this  potential they put so much pressure on
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3050400,3056559,him and it's like to me i'm like oh man  if you could just slow it down just a  tad yeah and but like that might be the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3056559,3061760,dad of me you know no but like you said  like we've seen it happen with the guy  there until we're here
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3061760,3066880,he's so talented he's next in line this  is the guy this is the guy then he loses  then all of a sudden the losses start
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3066880,3074000,piling up and then kamda you said he's  very young he's you know you could have  built them up way better than that and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3074000,3079599,maybe i think they were thinking about  that like yo let's just give them this  nate diaz fight real quick throw them up  a little more let them dominate a guy
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3079599,3086079,like nate diaz but they just ain't dumb  he knows what you're trying to do to him  you're trying to he was still down  though yeah but like he's not gonna sit
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3086079,3092559,there and i think they were going back  and forth but i don't think you  realistically yeah if i'm nate and i am  yeah like i'm gonna let this savage
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3092559,3097760,build his name off me as my last one to  go fight you know jake paul or something  like that yeah but i mean with nate diaz
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3097760,3103280,is like yo if i don't get finished he  won  ideas  and i was talking to uh jake shields too
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3103280,3108480,and he told me that  nate's not afraid nate's down oh yeah no  yeah i would never assume nate's a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3108480,3115119,friend yeah and i'm like all right cause  you know you whatever win or lose you're  still gonna have that fan base and you  go win 50 million dollars to fight jake
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3115119,3120960,paul oh he could lose 10 fights in a row  yeah he just has that unique fan base  that they just love what he represents
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3120960,3126240,yeah god bless him that's great like  what level what what do you need to do  to get that fan base though and that's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3126240,3131520,like the the goal is where like you're  graduating  you lose five in a row people don't
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3131520,3138559,understand that yo this guy's still  losing but oh conor mcgregor tweets out  title fight let me give it some nick  diaz teach out to kamara usman oh man
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3138559,3143599,nick diaz should fight kamara usman and  you're like what are these and the fans  are about yeah i'm like yeah what are
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3143599,3149599,you talking about right now like how how  does this make sense it's a good  question i don't know yeah i don't know
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3149599,3155839,if in 2022 if you can do it i don't know  i don't know if it's capable now you  know what i'm saying yeah i mean what i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3155839,3161760,think a guy that's showing me that he's  capable is petty pimplet where it's like  it was i was with him in
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3161760,3167599,arizona great guy he's a good dude he's  such a good dude yeah but it was like  the fans were like asking for pictures
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3167599,3172720,and he'd just like run inside the the  hotel  and i was sitting there outside taking  pictures with him getting selfies doing
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3172720,3179440,face-offs and then he was like yo i got  a scheduled uh i gotta schedule the  picture at the which call the at the
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3179440,3185680,fights in front of the arena like  scheduled that i'm gonna get paid for at  this and i'm sitting there like  he walked out the fans are going nuts
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3185680,3192000,and i'm like bro how's he getting this  much love i'm standing outside the hotel  in the heat swept my ass off yeah taking  a picture every single one of you guys
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3192000,3198160,and you guys are sitting there freaking  blowing this guy up and just ran in the  hotel i'm like how does it make sense i  think i think for patty it's like you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3198160,3205119,know  and i i i could be honest you know i'm  balls deep hardcore and mma like i knew  he was big out there in liverpool yeah
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3205119,3210960,and then when we did a food truck with  him in san diego i'm talking to his  manager who's a great guy  and
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3210960,3217119,he's like dude like  he didn't need the ufc like he was  selling out arenas on my show like in
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3217119,3222319,liverpool like he can't walk down the  street yeah and i was like really i've  never seen a bigger star man and you
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3222319,3228800,remember he's had darren till through  there uh hardy conor mcgregor i think  bisbee came out like the who soon he's
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3228800,3235040,like i've never seen a bigger star yeah  i was like what and he was like yeah we  call him the fifth beatle i was like  jesus christ being in arizona i was
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3235040,3240720,sitting there like is this good that was  my first time ever meeting him but i was  sitting there like nah the people in the  states don't really know him like that
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3240720,3246880,but like he walked out and he got the  biggest cheer i think he was even more  than sean o'malley and sean o'malley's  like hometown's hometown yeah and i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3246880,3252480,like  all right this guy is real but then you  got people  still think that you know he can knock
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3252480,3257520,out charlie's oliveira now like but that  doesn't make sense this is what's great  about patty is
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3257520,3264480,you and you'll you don't have guys come  on and they're young guys and if you  talk i'm sure you've talked on the show  like oh yeah i want to fight you know
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3264480,3270400,like you know if it's some young guy not  i'm not saying paddy did it's like oh  yeah i want to fight uh justin gaichi
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3270400,3276960,and you're like bro you have two fights  in the ufc yeah patty's not like that  patty's literally like uh yeah it's a
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3276960,3282319,marathon not a sprint man so i make more  fighting outside doctor than i do  fighting so unless the fight's right i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3282319,3287920,not doing [ __ ] yeah i know i got some  [ __ ] to work on but as far as grappling  goes i'll grapple with anybody like he
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3287920,3293599,what i love about him is it's so  authentic and he's aware of what's going  on how big he is but it doesn't get to
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3293599,3300079,his head like he's good yeah you know  he's like i just believe i have a  different skill set you know and i i'm  gonna get there but
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3300079,3306720,there's no rush yeah oh [ __ ] dude  honestly a lot of guys can learn even  like  me i'm learning stuff from him yeah as
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3306720,3313040,i'm just like sitting there just staring  at him and i'm sitting there like you  said like making so much money  without fighting and he's like all right
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3313040,3319119,well i'm charging you for this  appearance i'm charging you for this oh  i'm not going to do this interview  unless that's the takeaway that's the  takeaway when i was talking because i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3319119,3324400,get close with the manners right because  you know the the fighters being miked up  wherever like if ali came i love ollie i
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3324400,3331839,mean him talked a bunch he he does  wonders for you guys he's a monster  and it was uh patty's um manager i'm
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3331839,3336880,just talking to him and he's like yeah  man he's telling me what they usually  charge for
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3336880,3342000,interviews like basic interviews he's  like yeah we've had some problems with  big journalists because you know we're
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3342000,3348880,over in england and bt sport one  interview so like yeah i mean there's  how much cost to interview him like what  he's the guys play other athletes like
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3348880,3354640,you know soccer players and rugby and  football basketball like  he's as big as they are pay him dude
FQ_pn5QFBbk,3354640,3360559,he's getting paid yeah and in my it  changed i'm like more guys should do  this man like you get to a certain level
