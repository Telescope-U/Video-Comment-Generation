HsTKfFGL8mQ,10480,11920,wanna let you guys know i had a hard
HsTKfFGL8mQ,11920,13920,time making a thumbnail for this because
HsTKfFGL8mQ,13920,17840,my thumbnail guy couldn't find this rig
HsTKfFGL8mQ,17840,20160,anywhere that's okay it's okay i'm a big
HsTKfFGL8mQ,20160,23279,fan of shiro anyways
HsTKfFGL8mQ,24460,26400,[Music]
HsTKfFGL8mQ,26400,28880,and here we are again returning to anime
HsTKfFGL8mQ,28880,31359,dimensions simulator still don't
HsTKfFGL8mQ,31359,33440,understand why simulator is part of this
HsTKfFGL8mQ,33440,36160,title at all anyhow there was a one year
HsTKfFGL8mQ,36160,38320,um anniversary update so it's been
HsTKfFGL8mQ,38320,40480,around for one year i i didn't even know
HsTKfFGL8mQ,40480,43280,that what until now and i decided using
HsTKfFGL8mQ,43280,45760,this two times exp gold raid tokens
HsTKfFGL8mQ,45760,47520,event and come back into the game and
HsTKfFGL8mQ,47520,50879,catch back up shadow nojo mochi boy
HsTKfFGL8mQ,50879,54079,mochi boy boy pretty sure that's a trap
HsTKfFGL8mQ,54079,56239,so i've been working hard on the grind
HsTKfFGL8mQ,56239,59359,uh i picked up quite a bit of characters
HsTKfFGL8mQ,59359,62399,characters i have this one right here
HsTKfFGL8mQ,62399,65518,trap chat boy i also have
HsTKfFGL8mQ,65518,67920,shadow monarch i was told these two
HsTKfFGL8mQ,67920,69680,characters are supposed to be one of the
HsTKfFGL8mQ,69680,71200,best two characters in the game right
HsTKfFGL8mQ,71200,73600,now i'm pretty sure trap boy you can
HsTKfFGL8mQ,73600,77119,find a shop for 2500 gems while shadow
HsTKfFGL8mQ,77119,80159,monarch you have to find in uh speed
HsTKfFGL8mQ,80159,81680,runs
HsTKfFGL8mQ,81680,84960,yeah this guy right here 4 000.
HsTKfFGL8mQ,84960,87360,things are so different now and i'm kind
HsTKfFGL8mQ,87360,89119,of glad they didn't put in pvp into this
HsTKfFGL8mQ,89119,90960,game because i mean it wouldn't work out
HsTKfFGL8mQ,90960,92799,the way the skill works and i think it
HsTKfFGL8mQ,92799,94880,might ultimately hurt like the pve
HsTKfFGL8mQ,94880,97280,aspects the other dungeon stuff so i
HsTKfFGL8mQ,97280,99600,better get testing
HsTKfFGL8mQ,99600,102000,okay so i'm on shadow monarch right now
HsTKfFGL8mQ,102000,105119,yes i refuse to use any other skin
HsTKfFGL8mQ,105119,108159,let's see shadow rush oop
HsTKfFGL8mQ,108159,110799,a five second dash is pretty op and it
HsTKfFGL8mQ,110799,113360,has a iframe i think the other character
HsTKfFGL8mQ,113360,115200,the trap boy has this too
HsTKfFGL8mQ,115200,116799,all right let's see you see trap boy has
HsTKfFGL8mQ,116799,117840,it too this is trap boy with the
HsTKfFGL8mQ,117840,119439,umbrella okay all right you know what
HsTKfFGL8mQ,119439,121280,i'm taking off the skin actually
HsTKfFGL8mQ,121280,123759,all right let's see trap boy whirling
HsTKfFGL8mQ,123759,125520,thrusts
HsTKfFGL8mQ,125520,128080,okay so it's also a dash but it jumps up
HsTKfFGL8mQ,128080,130560,a little bit
HsTKfFGL8mQ,130560,132239,i don't know if it's
HsTKfFGL8mQ,132239,134239,better or worse if anything i think it's
HsTKfFGL8mQ,134239,136560,it's it's the same it's the same
HsTKfFGL8mQ,136560,138400,so their number one skills are the same
HsTKfFGL8mQ,138400,140640,so so far one one
HsTKfFGL8mQ,140640,144400,second attack ruler authority
HsTKfFGL8mQ,144400,146879,i like that i like that
HsTKfFGL8mQ,146879,148720,just pulls them into one location and
HsTKfFGL8mQ,148720,150959,boom blows up all right so the second
HsTKfFGL8mQ,150959,152400,attack for
HsTKfFGL8mQ,152400,155330,cat boy is beach ball slam
HsTKfFGL8mQ,155330,156480,[Music]
HsTKfFGL8mQ,156480,158000,this isn't bad either it's on a shorter
HsTKfFGL8mQ,158000,160160,cooler eight seconds versus ten
HsTKfFGL8mQ,160160,161360,it doesn't
HsTKfFGL8mQ,161360,164160,absorb him in so i guess it's not as
HsTKfFGL8mQ,164160,165280,good
HsTKfFGL8mQ,165280,167280,but the shorter cooldown is also a big
HsTKfFGL8mQ,167280,169200,difference
HsTKfFGL8mQ,169200,170879,i don't know i think it's i think it's a
HsTKfFGL8mQ,170879,174239,fair fight i think it's a half half yo
HsTKfFGL8mQ,174239,175599,this game has too many skins for this
HsTKfFGL8mQ,175599,176959,character like i don't understand what's
HsTKfFGL8mQ,176959,178959,going on why is there 20 000 skins for
HsTKfFGL8mQ,178959,180319,him bruh
HsTKfFGL8mQ,180319,183280,all right don't attack dragon sphere
HsTKfFGL8mQ,183280,185440,it does damage
HsTKfFGL8mQ,185440,187760,and then it lets you spam your first
HsTKfFGL8mQ,187760,190080,skill this is on 22 second cooldown
HsTKfFGL8mQ,190080,193040,which actually isn't too bad look
HsTKfFGL8mQ,193040,197120,boom boom dash three times four times
HsTKfFGL8mQ,197120,200319,and then dirt attack for trap boy is
HsTKfFGL8mQ,200319,202720,cheer
HsTKfFGL8mQ,203120,204879,yeah i think it's about

HsTKfFGL8mQ,215920,218720,shadow monarch's a solo character
HsTKfFGL8mQ,218720,220879,and then the last attack for shadow
