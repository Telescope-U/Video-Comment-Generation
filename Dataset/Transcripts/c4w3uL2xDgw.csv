c4w3uL2xDgw,0,1570,"- [Illustrator] You may not often think it,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,1570,4040,but roads are some of the most complex pieces
c4w3uL2xDgw,4040,6810,of infrastructure that mankind can produce.
c4w3uL2xDgw,6810,9880,And the methods of producing them are equal parts ingenious
c4w3uL2xDgw,9880,12380,and surprisingly mesmerizing to see.
c4w3uL2xDgw,12380,14130,"From building roads across desserts,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,14130,16670,to drones carrying out pothole repairs.
c4w3uL2xDgw,16670,19640,Let's take a look at some mind-blowing road technologies
c4w3uL2xDgw,19640,21432,you probably never considered.
c4w3uL2xDgw,22422,25540,(upbeat music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,25540,27020,Tiger Stone.
c4w3uL2xDgw,27020,28650,Have you ever found satisfaction
c4w3uL2xDgw,28650,31600,in the perfect tessellation of brick road paving?
c4w3uL2xDgw,31600,34940,"If so, I have the perfect machine for you."
c4w3uL2xDgw,34940,36629,"It may look like a giant printer,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,36630,39270,but this is the Tiger Stone Road Paver.
c4w3uL2xDgw,39270,40260,"It's a slow moving,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,40260,42969,"electric-powered paver that crawls along the road,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,42970,46110,laying a perfectly-assembled trail of bricks behind it.
c4w3uL2xDgw,46110,48470,Workers on the machine's galley take the bricks
c4w3uL2xDgw,48470,50760,from the holding hoppers on top and place them
c4w3uL2xDgw,50760,52390,"onto the moving shear plate,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,52390,54760,arranging them into the desired pattern.
c4w3uL2xDgw,54760,56930,This plate then feeds the interlocking bands
c4w3uL2xDgw,56930,57900,of bricks downwards
c4w3uL2xDgw,57900,60720,at a speed the workers can easily keep up with.
c4w3uL2xDgw,60720,62970,Gravity helps to secure the pattern in place
c4w3uL2xDgw,62970,65390,before it's gently laid onto the road surface
c4w3uL2xDgw,65390,67090,as the machine rolls forwards.
c4w3uL2xDgw,67090,69270,In contrast to traditional practices
c4w3uL2xDgw,69270,71329,which rely on workers placing each brick
c4w3uL2xDgw,71330,72860,"onto the road by hand,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,72860,74690,"this method saves time, effort,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,74690,77070,and back pain for all involved.
c4w3uL2xDgw,77070,78640,"At almost 20 feet wide,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,78640,81330,this stony printer has the capacity to lay just
c4w3uL2xDgw,81330,84890,"under 3,300 square-feet of paving per day"
c4w3uL2xDgw,84890,86909,when manned by just two people.
c4w3uL2xDgw,86910,89950,"But it can also be adjusted to print-pave smaller roads,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,89950,92369,in case you're strapped for available land.
c4w3uL2xDgw,92370,94891,Why can't my printer print roads?
c4w3uL2xDgw,94891,98224,(peaceful guitar music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,99590,101880,Golden Gate Bridge Road Zipper.
c4w3uL2xDgw,101880,104140,Rush hour might just be the ultimate bane
c4w3uL2xDgw,104140,105920,of a motorist's existence.
c4w3uL2xDgw,105920,108530,"In built-up city areas like San Francisco,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,108530,110190,records show commuters can lose up
c4w3uL2xDgw,110190,113100,to five days a year trapped in congestion.
c4w3uL2xDgw,113100,114630,"But as you probably imagined,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,114630,116930,there's a machine designed to help with that.
c4w3uL2xDgw,116930,119980,"This is the Golden Gate Bridge Barrier Transfer Machine,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,119980,122240,"also nicknamed The Road Zipper,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,122240,123509,and you can see why.
c4w3uL2xDgw,123510,126110,It's designed to change the position of the concrete
c4w3uL2xDgw,126110,127940,or steel lane dividers separating
c4w3uL2xDgw,127940,129690,the two directions of traffic.
c4w3uL2xDgw,129690,132520,"Before rush hour, the road zipper will shift the barriers"
c4w3uL2xDgw,132520,135240,to give drivers an extra lane to help ease congestion
c4w3uL2xDgw,135240,136700,in the busier direction.
c4w3uL2xDgw,136700,140020,The vehicle uses an S shaped inverted conveyor channel
c4w3uL2xDgw,140020,140980,"in its undercarriage,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,140980,143409,which is basically a high-powered roller system
c4w3uL2xDgw,143410,146130,that lifts the barrier segments up and transfers them
c4w3uL2xDgw,146130,147410,to a new position.
c4w3uL2xDgw,147410,148830,"It's an impressive task,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,148830,151400,"considering there are 3,200 blocks making"
c4w3uL2xDgw,151400,152939,up the full moveable barrier
c4w3uL2xDgw,152940,155430,"over the 1.7 mile-long bridge,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,155430,158719,"with each segment weighing 1,500 pounds."
c4w3uL2xDgw,158720,161201,Now that's what you call a heavy-duty zipper.
c4w3uL2xDgw,161201,164368,(upbeat guitar music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,166250,169060,Electreon Wireless Electric Roads.
c4w3uL2xDgw,169060,172090,"At this point, around 14 countries and over 20 cities"
c4w3uL2xDgw,172090,174510,around the world have proposed future bans
c4w3uL2xDgw,174510,176720,on vehicles powered by fossil fuels.
c4w3uL2xDgw,176720,180300,"France, Norway, the UK, and even China are all preparing"
c4w3uL2xDgw,180300,183450,"to get from A to B without their foot on the gas,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,183450,185739,but how will that be made possible?
c4w3uL2xDgw,185740,188710,"One option has been offered by company Electreon,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,188710,191560,who specialize in Wireless Electric Roads.
c4w3uL2xDgw,191560,194349,"Already used in projects in Tel Aviv and Sweden,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,194350,197030,this Israeli company has a road design capable
c4w3uL2xDgw,197030,199520,of wirelessly powering electric vehicles
c4w3uL2xDgw,199520,200780,while they're driving.
c4w3uL2xDgw,200780,203180,The execution of this technology is achieved
c4w3uL2xDgw,203180,205299,by integrating a narrow copper coil
c4w3uL2xDgw,205300,207180,"into existing asphalt roads,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,207180,208609,"linked to the electric grid,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,208610,211400,and synced to installable vehicle hardware.
c4w3uL2xDgw,211400,212659,"According to Electreon,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,212660,215240,the process of installing one mile of this coil
c4w3uL2xDgw,215240,218370,from start to finish can be achieved in just a few days.
c4w3uL2xDgw,218370,221069,"A receiver under the electric vehicle chassis,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,221070,222850,linked to Electreon's dynamic
c4w3uL2xDgw,222850,224810,"wireless power transfer system,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,224810,227349,allows the vehicle to harness power wirelessly
c4w3uL2xDgw,227350,228590,while it travels.
c4w3uL2xDgw,228590,230410,"In theory, this eliminates the need"
c4w3uL2xDgw,230410,231580,"for bulky batteries,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,231580,234560,"and providing the car only drives on these types of roads,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,234560,236270,it can be powered indefinitely.
c4w3uL2xDgw,236270,238260,If combined with a rechargeable battery
c4w3uL2xDgw,238260,239799,"for traveling off-the-grid,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,239800,241730,this could well be a viable solution
c4w3uL2xDgw,241730,244050,to powering electric vehicles in the future.
c4w3uL2xDgw,244050,247793,Now this is the future Scalextric kids prepared for.
c4w3uL2xDgw,249117,251290,Nextrencher Trencher Disc.
c4w3uL2xDgw,251290,252920,"From wiring to drainage,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,252920,255360,a lot of stuff needs to be excavated and buried
c4w3uL2xDgw,255360,256720,"when upgrading a road,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,256720,259250,and for that you need a machine that can really punch
c4w3uL2xDgw,259250,260510,through the asphalt.
c4w3uL2xDgw,260510,263980,The Nextrencher Trencher Disc D-80 is a high-powered tool
c4w3uL2xDgw,263980,266400,that can cut through and remove urban materials
c4w3uL2xDgw,266400,269720,like concrete and asphalt to a depth of almost three feet.
c4w3uL2xDgw,269720,272660,"Usually, excavation disks used in trenching projects"
c4w3uL2xDgw,272660,274150,like this are exposed.
c4w3uL2xDgw,274150,276690,"But when you're trying to keep fast traffic moving,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,276690,279550,the last thing you need is for stones and bits of debris
c4w3uL2xDgw,279550,281870,to go flying into oncoming vehicles.
c4w3uL2xDgw,281870,285190,"Instead, the Nextrencher design encloses the entire top"
c4w3uL2xDgw,285190,286023,"of the disk,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,286023,287750,"meaning there's no disruption to traffic,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,287750,290260,and laborers can work safely alongside it.
c4w3uL2xDgw,290260,292060,Debris is fed up through a conveyor belt
c4w3uL2xDgw,292060,295350,or chain to an extractor which then deposits the fragments
c4w3uL2xDgw,295350,296620,on the side on the road.
c4w3uL2xDgw,296620,299110,Its efficient design means the disk trencher can cut
c4w3uL2xDgw,299110,301169,"around 330 feet an hour,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,301170,303050,depending on the surface at hand.
c4w3uL2xDgw,303050,306024,And maybe a little longer if someone falls underneath.
c4w3uL2xDgw,306024,308690,(ambient music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,310630,312980,Self-Repairing Cities Initiative.
c4w3uL2xDgw,312980,315680,"The world seems to be obsessed with drones these days,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,315680,317610,"and it can get a little exhausting,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,317610,320259,but there are actually some incredible potential uses
c4w3uL2xDgw,320260,322830,"for drones that you'd probably never expect,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,322830,324330,like repairing potholes.
c4w3uL2xDgw,324330,326689,Researchers from the University of Leeds have put
c4w3uL2xDgw,326690,328630,forward their solution of using drones
c4w3uL2xDgw,328630,331830,with 3D printing capabilities to fill in potholes.
c4w3uL2xDgw,331830,334259,"Although it's still in its concept phase,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,334260,335830,this could prove to be the answer
c4w3uL2xDgw,335830,337889,to on-demand pothole filing.
c4w3uL2xDgw,337890,339610,"The researchers have explained that,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,339610,342349,"in theory, the drones would be able to scan potholes"
c4w3uL2xDgw,342350,345510,on a closed road to get the orientation of the indent.
c4w3uL2xDgw,345510,346530,"With that information,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,346530,348960,they can then use an attached extruder machine
c4w3uL2xDgw,348960,350690,"to pour materials like asphalt,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,350690,353110,or tar into the hole in a specific pattern
c4w3uL2xDgw,353110,354840,to give it a smooth finish.
c4w3uL2xDgw,354840,356530,"It all seems very promising,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,356530,360040,and I really hope the tech is all it's cracked up to be.
c4w3uL2xDgw,360040,363290,(ambient guitar music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,364750,366650,ETI Roller Barrier.
c4w3uL2xDgw,366650,369810,Traffic barriers and jersey barriers may help you feel safe
c4w3uL2xDgw,369810,370643,"on the road,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,370643,372310,but anyone who's been in a collision
c4w3uL2xDgw,372310,374740,with one will tell you they're no fun to hit.
c4w3uL2xDgw,374740,377039,But there is a safer way forward.
c4w3uL2xDgw,377040,379720,Take a look at the ETI Roller System developed
c4w3uL2xDgw,379720,380870,in South Korea.
c4w3uL2xDgw,380870,383770,This design does way more than just preventing vehicles
c4w3uL2xDgw,383770,385160,from diving off the road.
c4w3uL2xDgw,385160,387480,These rollers are able to convert a good deal
c4w3uL2xDgw,387480,390270,of the impact energy into rotational energy.
c4w3uL2xDgw,390270,392720,This prevents the vehicle from breaking through the barrier
c4w3uL2xDgw,392720,395860,and instead redirects the vehicle back onto the road.
c4w3uL2xDgw,395860,397229,The rollers themselves are made
c4w3uL2xDgw,397230,400350,"from a material called Ethylene Vinyl-Acetate,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,400350,401820,or EVA for short.
c4w3uL2xDgw,401820,404670,EVA's rubber-like structure and lightweight form means
c4w3uL2xDgw,404670,406450,"that the rollers aren't easily damaged,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,406450,408370,even when they're hit by heavy Vehicles
c4w3uL2xDgw,408370,409729,like trucks and buses.
c4w3uL2xDgw,409730,411350,Everything about the design helps
c4w3uL2xDgw,411350,412940,"to propel the vehicle forward,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,412940,415550,"which is what traditional crash barriers do,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,415550,417120,"only not this efficiently,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,417120,419919,"so if you ever find yourself head-on with one of these,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,419920,421679,just roll with it.
c4w3uL2xDgw,421679,423219,(upbeat music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,423220,424630,Geocells.
c4w3uL2xDgw,424630,426920,Building a road from scratch can require much more
c4w3uL2xDgw,426920,429000,than just slapping down a ton of asphalt.
c4w3uL2xDgw,429000,430650,Depending on the terrain you may need
c4w3uL2xDgw,430650,432620,"to take soil erosion into account,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,432620,433650,and employ methods
c4w3uL2xDgw,433650,436490,to prevent your hard-built road crumbling apart.
c4w3uL2xDgw,436490,439680,That's why some construction companies use Geocells.
c4w3uL2xDgw,439680,442229,These are made from geosynthetic materials designed
c4w3uL2xDgw,442230,444810,to be durable enough to reinforce the soil bed
c4w3uL2xDgw,444810,448710,"to withstand up to 5,080 pounds of pressure per foot."
c4w3uL2xDgw,448710,451500,The cellular design and base component can be changed
c4w3uL2xDgw,451500,452940,"depending the application,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,452940,454160,meaning no matter what kind
c4w3uL2xDgw,454160,456070,"of soil the project is planned on,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,456070,458970,Geocells can help maintain structural integrity.
c4w3uL2xDgw,458970,461960,"In this instance, a series of stretched perforated cells"
c4w3uL2xDgw,461960,464160,are being used to prevent base level erosion
c4w3uL2xDgw,464160,465570,on a highway shoulder.
c4w3uL2xDgw,465570,468190,But they can also be used in extreme circumstances
c4w3uL2xDgw,468190,470400,like stabilizing sand-based foundations
c4w3uL2xDgw,470400,471840,across stretches of desert.
c4w3uL2xDgw,471840,472860,"It's pretty impressive,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,472860,474969,and just goes to show that everyone benefits
c4w3uL2xDgw,474970,478476,"from a little support once in a while, even roads."
c4w3uL2xDgw,478476,482350,(peaceful piano music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,482350,485400,Python 5000 Pothole Patcher.
c4w3uL2xDgw,485400,488150,"Potholes are the enemy of all road users,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,488150,490639,and are capable of turning a completely normal road
c4w3uL2xDgw,490640,492840,into an infuriating obstacle course.
c4w3uL2xDgw,492840,495530,"They're so reviled that back in 2011,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,495530,497800,the UK's Automobile Association joked
c4w3uL2xDgw,497800,499300,about literally highlighting
c4w3uL2xDgw,499300,502349,how sick they were of their nation's plentiful potholes.
c4w3uL2xDgw,502350,504340,"To combat this scourge of the roads,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,504340,507180,the inventors at Superior Roads Solutions have created
c4w3uL2xDgw,507180,510180,the Python 5000 Pothole Patcher.
c4w3uL2xDgw,510180,512390,Unlike traditional methods of pothole patching
c4w3uL2xDgw,512390,514860,"which require a lot of manual labor,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,514860,517839,the Pothole Patcher is able to fill and patch any hole
c4w3uL2xDgw,517840,520849,with the operator comfortably sat in the machine's cabin.
c4w3uL2xDgw,520849,523509,The five ton hopper located behind the cabin
c4w3uL2xDgw,523510,527380,"uses an exhaust circulation system to keep hot asphalt hot,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,527380,530110,or warm up cold asphalt to a working temperature
c4w3uL2xDgw,530110,532100,of around 300 Fahrenheit.
c4w3uL2xDgw,532100,534300,It's then fed through into a four foot
c4w3uL2xDgw,534300,536760,"extendable working arm at the front of the cabin,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,536760,538930,then sprayed out of the arm's nozzle.
c4w3uL2xDgw,538930,541700,"The asphalt is then leveled out by an attached rake,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,541700,544790,before being compacted into the hole by the arm's roller
c4w3uL2xDgw,544790,546370,for a smooth finish.
c4w3uL2xDgw,546370,550060,"What's more, Superior Roads claim the Python 5000"
c4w3uL2xDgw,550060,551590,is three times faster
c4w3uL2xDgw,551590,554310,than a three-person crew doing the same job.
c4w3uL2xDgw,554310,557430,"Suddenly it seems like we might win the war on potholes,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,557430,558680,but we may have to bow down
c4w3uL2xDgw,558680,562029,to our robotic pothole-fixing overlords in the process.
c4w3uL2xDgw,562029,565362,(peaceful guitar music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,566870,569529,Power Curber 7700.
c4w3uL2xDgw,569530,572030,"Have you ever noticed the long, unbroken lines"
c4w3uL2xDgw,572030,574550,of concrete barriers that sometimes skirt stretches
c4w3uL2xDgw,574550,575420,of the highway?
c4w3uL2xDgw,575420,577540,"Being as long and continuous as they are,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,577540,580430,you may have wondered how they got there in the first place.
c4w3uL2xDgw,580430,581930,They're actually made on-site
c4w3uL2xDgw,581930,583760,"by a method of called slip forming,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,583760,585970,where cement concrete is poured and molded
c4w3uL2xDgw,585970,588230,by a continuously moving machine.
c4w3uL2xDgw,588230,589550,When you combine that method
c4w3uL2xDgw,589550,591830,"with some additional mechanical ingenuity,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,591830,594400,you get the Power Curber 7700.
c4w3uL2xDgw,594400,597460,It features a telescopic frame which allows the machine
c4w3uL2xDgw,597460,600610,to straddle the triangular shape of two metal grids.
c4w3uL2xDgw,600610,603930,"Once in position, cement concrete is fed by a conveyor belt"
c4w3uL2xDgw,603930,605040,"into the forming house,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,605040,606570,where it is mechanically applied
c4w3uL2xDgw,606570,608330,to the triangular metal frame.
c4w3uL2xDgw,608330,610320,"As the machine slowly moves along,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,610320,613740,"cement concrete passes down onto the frame and is smoothed,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,613740,616320,creating a seamless highway barrier wall.
c4w3uL2xDgw,616320,618770,"With the conveyor, tracks, and straddle device,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,618770,622640,"this machine can weigh in at a colossal 80,000 pounds."
c4w3uL2xDgw,622640,625010,"But of course, the Power Curber never lets its weight"
c4w3uL2xDgw,625010,627793,become a barrier to success.
c4w3uL2xDgw,628970,630259,Gomaco.
c4w3uL2xDgw,630260,632850,"When it comes to the kings of slip-forming machines,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,632850,635420,a company called Gomaco sits at the top.
c4w3uL2xDgw,635420,637810,Their colossal units provide different types
c4w3uL2xDgw,637810,639610,"of paving depending on the project,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,639610,641240,but can also be customized
c4w3uL2xDgw,641240,643930,to fit the most impossible-looking endeavors.
c4w3uL2xDgw,643930,647850,What you see here is a Gomaco GP3 Slip Form Paver.
c4w3uL2xDgw,647850,651149,Designed to pave floor coverings up to 30 feet wide.
c4w3uL2xDgw,651150,653780,It works by placing a measured supply of concrete
c4w3uL2xDgw,653780,654710,"in front of the paver,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,654710,657180,"which is then spread, shaped, and consolidated"
c4w3uL2xDgw,657180,658500,at a specific height.
c4w3uL2xDgw,658500,660340,But Gomaco doesn't just produce
c4w3uL2xDgw,660340,663010,one size fits all slip forming machines;
c4w3uL2xDgw,663010,666350,"just take a look at the customized GP-2600,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,666350,669779,used in the creation of Turkey's Batman Canal system.
c4w3uL2xDgw,669780,671630,"No, not that Batman."
c4w3uL2xDgw,671630,673690,This four-track slip-former was designed
c4w3uL2xDgw,673690,675660,"with a sectional, trapezoidal mold"
c4w3uL2xDgw,675660,678629,which could be adjusted for different slopes and depths.
c4w3uL2xDgw,678630,681230,"A work bridge behind the paver was also installed,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,681230,683850,so workers could apply a trowel finish by hand
c4w3uL2xDgw,683850,685639,to the molded cement concrete.
c4w3uL2xDgw,685640,687170,"Despite the complexity,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,687170,690089,overall production topped out at an impressive rate
c4w3uL2xDgw,690090,693440,"of 1,969 feet per day,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,693440,695810,which is just under half the main span length
c4w3uL2xDgw,695810,697380,of the Golden Gate bridge.
c4w3uL2xDgw,697380,699841,Now that's how you pave the way to success.

c4w3uL2xDgw,705175,706175,Leeboy 8500.
c4w3uL2xDgw,707220,708889,Relaying an asphalt road
c4w3uL2xDgw,708890,711090,"is a fairly common construction task,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,711090,713320,but what kind of machines can you employ
c4w3uL2xDgw,713320,715840,to re-surface asphalt on your driveway?
c4w3uL2xDgw,715840,718630,Get ready for the Leeboy 8500.
c4w3uL2xDgw,718630,720870,This machine is part of a specialized series
c4w3uL2xDgw,720870,722940,of conveyor asphalt pavers that are some
c4w3uL2xDgw,722940,724800,of the most efficient on the market.
c4w3uL2xDgw,724800,727480,Asphalt pavers work by transferring asphalt
c4w3uL2xDgw,727480,729310,from the hopper to a heated auger
c4w3uL2xDgw,729310,730710,via a conveyor belt.
c4w3uL2xDgw,730710,732790,The auger will then place a measured amount
c4w3uL2xDgw,732790,734990,"of the heated asphalt in front of the screed,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,734990,738399,which is a fancy name for a tool used to smooth materials.
c4w3uL2xDgw,738400,741030,What makes the 8500 so practical is
c4w3uL2xDgw,741030,743950,that it has a 15-foot-wide screed footprint.
c4w3uL2xDgw,743950,746560,The perfect size to drag asphalt over surfaces
c4w3uL2xDgw,746560,749100,like driveways for a clean finish.
c4w3uL2xDgw,749100,751269,"And with a seven and a half ton hopper,"
c4w3uL2xDgw,751270,754060,it's able to lay a lot of asphalt in one go.
c4w3uL2xDgw,754060,756720,Perfect for when the perfectly reasonable urge
c4w3uL2xDgw,756720,759910,to build a road seizes you on a Saturday afternoon.
c4w3uL2xDgw,759911,762651,(peaceful upbeat music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,762651,764280,(upbeat music)
c4w3uL2xDgw,764280,766130,Did any of these amazing road-building
c4w3uL2xDgw,766130,767910,technologies surprise you?
