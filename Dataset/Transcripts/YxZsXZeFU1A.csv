YxZsXZeFU1A,2785,4785,You feel like
YxZsXZeFU1A,6324,8602,your life is going to last a long time
YxZsXZeFU1A,9562,12466,and if I was to talk to my 26 year old self
YxZsXZeFU1A,14513,17378,I would tell that kid
YxZsXZeFU1A,18814,20401,that you don't have time
YxZsXZeFU1A,21202,22202,and...
YxZsXZeFU1A,25534,28549,"and you really, you don't know when it's going to end."
YxZsXZeFU1A,30628,31826,And so
YxZsXZeFU1A,32055,34706,"get out there and do the things you want to do,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,34808,36808,get out there and get after them now.
YxZsXZeFU1A,36919,38919,"Don't wait another second,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,39189,40728,take advantage of it.
YxZsXZeFU1A,43037,45037,Get out there and live
YxZsXZeFU1A,45553,48362,and strive to be better
YxZsXZeFU1A,49171,51044,because the life you've got
YxZsXZeFU1A,51195,53679,which I just said was a gift.
YxZsXZeFU1A,54536,56091,It is a gift.
YxZsXZeFU1A,58327,59327,So live it
YxZsXZeFU1A,63287,65001,"Yeah, I always wanted to be a commando"
YxZsXZeFU1A,65025,66278,ever since I was a little kid
YxZsXZeFU1A,66303,67310,and...
YxZsXZeFU1A,67453,68501,I...
YxZsXZeFU1A,68540,70634,heard that the Seals were really tough
YxZsXZeFU1A,70659,72523,and that the training was really tough
YxZsXZeFU1A,72587,74587,"and then you know, once you get in"
YxZsXZeFU1A,74611,76793,everyone makes a big deal out of BUDS that's...
YxZsXZeFU1A,76919,78276,"but it's, it's..."
YxZsXZeFU1A,78347,80347,in the Seal Teams it's no big deal.
YxZsXZeFU1A,83711,85218,Everyone goes through it
YxZsXZeFU1A,85297,86827,"you get cold, you get wet."
YxZsXZeFU1A,86923,88367,Whatever
YxZsXZeFU1A,90081,92445,You do a bunch of push-ups and pull-ups and dips.
YxZsXZeFU1A,96747,100636,Anyone that gets to the Seal Teams and does deployments overseas
YxZsXZeFU1A,100660,102985,and has a real career
YxZsXZeFU1A,103359,105493,"they're not talking about BUDS training,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,106357,107897,it just doesn't mean anything.
YxZsXZeFU1A,112039,113491,"I had a guy that was you know,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,113515,116332,NCAA water polo team captain champion
YxZsXZeFU1A,116490,117490,he quit.
YxZsXZeFU1A,117728,120941,And I had a guy that was an Olympic ultimate gymnast
YxZsXZeFU1A,121021,122021,and he quit.
YxZsXZeFU1A,123061,124695,Just because someone's
YxZsXZeFU1A,125027,127828,a good physical athlete
YxZsXZeFU1A,128360,130486,it doesn't mean that they're a good Seal
YxZsXZeFU1A,130684,134033,because being a good Seal is a lot more than just being a good athlete.
YxZsXZeFU1A,134985,137167,Being a good athlete is like the baseline
YxZsXZeFU1A,137849,140253,and it's everything that you've learned to do after that.
YxZsXZeFU1A,140424,143551,"A good leader, a guy that's tactically sound, a guy that makes good decisions,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,143575,146186,"a guy that's good under pressure, a guy that doesn't..."
YxZsXZeFU1A,146582,149463,Ever give up on trying to accomplish the mission
YxZsXZeFU1A,150161,151970,Those are the things that make a good Seal.
YxZsXZeFU1A,155859,157443,See you're always learning and growing
YxZsXZeFU1A,157468,159587,and I was always learning until the day I retired.
YxZsXZeFU1A,159611,162784,Because it's not a Boom this happened and everything changes
YxZsXZeFU1A,162809,165705,it's a constant addition of skill set
YxZsXZeFU1A,165729,168697,and repetition of situations
YxZsXZeFU1A,168721,171775,where you become competent at your job.
YxZsXZeFU1A,173871,176322,The fear of getting shot or killed
YxZsXZeFU1A,176980,178536,is not on your mind
YxZsXZeFU1A,178670,179717,when you're in the moment.
YxZsXZeFU1A,179742,181867,"You know, it'll build up when you're waiting to go out."
YxZsXZeFU1A,181891,184152,"You know, there's times when you're waiting to go out and you're like"
YxZsXZeFU1A,184326,186127,thinking to yourself. Okay
YxZsXZeFU1A,186365,188007,There's a lot of bad things going on out there
YxZsXZeFU1A,188031,189650,and some of them could happen to me.
YxZsXZeFU1A,189761,194014,But I think at some point you- you realize that
YxZsXZeFU1A,195775,197599,there's nothing you can do about that
YxZsXZeFU1A,197988,199885,I mean other than just quit
YxZsXZeFU1A,199980,203487,and- and just resign yourself to a life of cowardice.
YxZsXZeFU1A,203931,205931,But if you opt to not do that
YxZsXZeFU1A,206081,209581,"and you step up and say, ""Okay, I'm ready"
YxZsXZeFU1A,209803,212118,"and if I die, I die"""
YxZsXZeFU1A,212428,214428,and once you overcome that then...
YxZsXZeFU1A,216562,218332,Nothing else to be afraid of.
YxZsXZeFU1A,220109,222791,There's no one that wishes for peace more
YxZsXZeFU1A,222862,224862,than people that have been to war.
YxZsXZeFU1A,224950,228068,Because when the war drums sound
YxZsXZeFU1A,228299,230846,"it's my friends that are going to fight,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,230870,232179,"that's- that's who's going to fight,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,232203,235623,it's my friends that are going to- to put their lives on the line.
YxZsXZeFU1A,235647,236678,So...
YxZsXZeFU1A,237099,238884,"When the, when the war drums sound"
YxZsXZeFU1A,238908,241431,the people that have been to war are the ones that actually
YxZsXZeFU1A,241455,243780,"say, ""Let's think about this first"""
YxZsXZeFU1A,244597,245629,Because...
YxZsXZeFU1A,246152,248540,like I said before and like everyone says all the time
YxZsXZeFU1A,248564,251167,"and they say it like, it's no big deal but war is hell."
YxZsXZeFU1A,251239,253333,And when you take an 18 year old kid
YxZsXZeFU1A,253357,254872,and you're going to go put him in a situation
YxZsXZeFU1A,254897,257127,where he's going to have to kill people
YxZsXZeFU1A,257190,260126,and possibly get wounded or possibly get killed himself
YxZsXZeFU1A,260150,261919,that's a traumatic experience.
YxZsXZeFU1A,262126,265300,"And so before you do that, you should think about"
YxZsXZeFU1A,265379,266831,why you're doing it.
YxZsXZeFU1A,266855,268188,"And understand if,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,268260,269267,if...
YxZsXZeFU1A,269895,273639,the people have the will to fight
YxZsXZeFU1A,274425,277297,"and the will to fight as I've said many times before,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,277322,279956,the will to fight is the will to kill and it's the will to die.
YxZsXZeFU1A,279980,282519,And those are some pretty big wills that you need to have.
YxZsXZeFU1A,286551,289026,Almost immediately we're going to...
YxZsXZeFU1A,289264,292399,memorial services for army guys
YxZsXZeFU1A,292423,294423,Marines that are killed
YxZsXZeFU1A,294835,295906,which...
YxZsXZeFU1A,296684,300182,"you know, was a rude awakening."
YxZsXZeFU1A,301088,302103,So...
YxZsXZeFU1A,302626,304475,that's- that's the welcome to Ramadi.
YxZsXZeFU1A,304499,306228,The welcome to Ramadi is
YxZsXZeFU1A,306324,307537,"you know, you're going to go"
YxZsXZeFU1A,307561,309497,and pay your respects to some guys that were just killed
YxZsXZeFU1A,309521,311322,and- and there's firefights in the city.
YxZsXZeFU1A,311346,314131,So we're- we're just across the river from the city
YxZsXZeFU1A,314156,317576,"There's firefights in the city all day, there's firefights in the city all night"
YxZsXZeFU1A,317941,320034,"we're on the rooftop of our building,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,320059,321979,you sit there and watch tracer fire go back and forth
YxZsXZeFU1A,322004,325392,"We're shot at from, you know, across the river bank."
YxZsXZeFU1A,325836,326891,There's...
YxZsXZeFU1A,327312,329375,"Yeah, it was it was legit."
YxZsXZeFU1A,329399,331891,"It was legit combat, it was a legit..."
YxZsXZeFU1A,332105,336009,bad scenario with all sustained combat operations.
YxZsXZeFU1A,336382,337921,How do you lead your men through that
YxZsXZeFU1A,337945,340762,when you know they're dealing with not only the funerals
YxZsXZeFU1A,340793,342626,which definitely take a psychological toll
YxZsXZeFU1A,342650,345126,but then even that just constant firefighting over there?
YxZsXZeFU1A,345150,347824,"I mean, do you have to switch up your gear and think okay"
YxZsXZeFU1A,347879,349195,I got to lead stronger
YxZsXZeFU1A,349220,352450,"or maybe a little easier in certain scenarios, are you changing?"
YxZsXZeFU1A,352474,354569,"Yes, you do have to modulate"
YxZsXZeFU1A,354680,357362,your- your leadership and you have to do that
YxZsXZeFU1A,357448,358456,"if you're in the business world,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,358481,360591,you have to do that if you're leading any kind of team.
YxZsXZeFU1A,360631,363337,You've got to modulate and you got to recognize
YxZsXZeFU1A,363361,365225,when your guys need to be pushed and...
YxZsXZeFU1A,365257,367003,when your guys need to be
YxZsXZeFU1A,367027,368685,not pushed and given a rest.
YxZsXZeFU1A,368710,370710,So you're constantly doing that.
YxZsXZeFU1A,370837,372511,Regardless of what kind of team you're leading
YxZsXZeFU1A,372535,374535,"and in combat like, you know, I say all the time"
YxZsXZeFU1A,374931,376407,it's amplified
YxZsXZeFU1A,376431,378542,"because if you push your guys too hard in combat,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,378566,379907,they're going to break.
YxZsXZeFU1A,380081,382897,"You know whereas in business, oh maybe they make errors on something"
YxZsXZeFU1A,382922,383937,"or maybe they do snap,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,383962,385541,I mean it does happen in the business world
YxZsXZeFU1A,385588,387866,where people like can't take it anymore.
YxZsXZeFU1A,388199,389199,But...
YxZsXZeFU1A,389412,391412,"in combat, it'll happen very quickly."
YxZsXZeFU1A,391554,392712,"And- and so,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,392737,395252,"you know, you do, you're constantly modulating"
YxZsXZeFU1A,395331,396331,and...
YxZsXZeFU1A,396498,399393,taking measure of where your guys are at.
YxZsXZeFU1A,399790,402083,"And you know, sometimes I didn't do a great job of that."
YxZsXZeFU1A,402107,405091,"Sometimes I went a little far and said, ""Oh,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,405638,407638,"Wow, I just saw the look on that guy's face"
YxZsXZeFU1A,407693,409693,"He's, he needs a rest"
YxZsXZeFU1A,409875,412374,"and I should have recognized that earlier""."
YxZsXZeFU1A,413683,414683,And...
YxZsXZeFU1A,415366,417366,"You know, you make mistakes"
YxZsXZeFU1A,417794,418984,no doubt.
YxZsXZeFU1A,420523,421991,What I had on my side
YxZsXZeFU1A,422015,424149,was I had experience
YxZsXZeFU1A,424347,427965,and I had paid attention to my elders when I was a kid.
YxZsXZeFU1A,428339,430694,And when I was getting trained
YxZsXZeFU1A,430719,433234,and there was no war going on and it was the 90s
YxZsXZeFU1A,433258,434956,and I'd hear a guy
YxZsXZeFU1A,435123,437495,"you know, someone whose name you'll never hear"
YxZsXZeFU1A,437520,440177,but a guy that if you're in the Seal Teams you know who that person is
YxZsXZeFU1A,440201,444399,because they were a legit badass Vietnam War hero.
YxZsXZeFU1A,444875,448033,"You hear them say something, I would hear them say something"
YxZsXZeFU1A,448548,451206,and I would collect that and I would hang on to it.
YxZsXZeFU1A,451230,454420,That's what prepared me was that experience of growing up
YxZsXZeFU1A,454444,456444,with listening to my elders.
YxZsXZeFU1A,456848,458848,The Seal team
YxZsXZeFU1A,459196,460531,Doctrine
YxZsXZeFU1A,460825,462054,wasn't written down anywhere.
YxZsXZeFU1A,462078,463697,It was all word of mouth
YxZsXZeFU1A,463721,467387,and and passed down from generation to generation that way.
YxZsXZeFU1A,467736,468918,And...
YxZsXZeFU1A,470140,471862,"Making sure that you're not being cocky,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,471886,473258,making sure that you don't have the attitude
YxZsXZeFU1A,473284,474725,that you talked about earlier of
YxZsXZeFU1A,474751,476970,"you know, we're always going to be better than the enemy,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,476995,479534,We're always going to win because you're not always going to win
YxZsXZeFU1A,479559,481543,and especially if you think you're always going to win
YxZsXZeFU1A,481568,482979,then you're not going to prepare
YxZsXZeFU1A,483463,484867,"the, the way you should."
YxZsXZeFU1A,484891,487097,You're not going to give everything you can
YxZsXZeFU1A,487121,489382,to your training to making sure that you are prepared
YxZsXZeFU1A,489406,491001,for that moment when it comes.
YxZsXZeFU1A,491182,492792,"And it might come once on a deployment,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,492816,494458,it might not come on a deployment
YxZsXZeFU1A,494482,496482,and it might come on a daily basis.
YxZsXZeFU1A,499752,501752,The sentries that are trying to
YxZsXZeFU1A,501887,505496,"hold down the fort and protect would take cover from all this,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,505521,508060,all this enemy fire that was coming at them
YxZsXZeFU1A,508084,511504,in would come a big suicide vehicle-borne IED.
YxZsXZeFU1A,511551,513701,"truck, truck loaded bomb"
YxZsXZeFU1A,513820,515684,and they would just drive right into the compound
YxZsXZeFU1A,515708,518771,and detonate themselves and kill dozens of people
YxZsXZeFU1A,518857,521071,and they did that on multiple occasions
YxZsXZeFU1A,521096,525230,They did it times where they did it to multiple areas at the same time.
YxZsXZeFU1A,525714,527523,So that's how coordinated the enemy was
YxZsXZeFU1A,527547,529102,"they were, they knew what they were doing."
YxZsXZeFU1A,529126,531451,Were you impressed by them? Were you ever like...
YxZsXZeFU1A,531815,533116,I didn't expect that to happen
YxZsXZeFU1A,533140,535973,or did you ever have a respect for their tactics?
YxZsXZeFU1A,535997,538060,I absolutely always had respect.
YxZsXZeFU1A,538084,540409,I respect the enemy absolutely
YxZsXZeFU1A,540773,542352,and the minute you're not showing respect
YxZsXZeFU1A,542377,544344,to the enemy and their capabilities is again
YxZsXZeFU1A,544392,546884,that's a lack humility and it's going to get you killed.
YxZsXZeFU1A,547844,551471,"You know, they, you- you have to respect your enemy at all times."
YxZsXZeFU1A,554169,556230,And whether your mission is go out and capture kill bad guys
YxZsXZeFU1A,556255,557469,or your mission is to
YxZsXZeFU1A,557493,559063,produce something or sell something
YxZsXZeFU1A,559089,561516,or manufacture something or design something
YxZsXZeFU1A,561985,563985,trying to get that team
YxZsXZeFU1A,564151,567611,to be unified behind the plan and execute it efficiently.
YxZsXZeFU1A,567635,569285,It doesn't matter what the mission is
YxZsXZeFU1A,569309,570912,"you're still dealing with human beings,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,570936,572936,you're still dealing with people.
YxZsXZeFU1A,573205,574260,Whether you're in the Seal Teams
YxZsXZeFU1A,574285,576267,or whether you're in the army or the Marine Corps
YxZsXZeFU1A,576300,578474,the people that are working for you are not robots
YxZsXZeFU1A,578752,581926,they're people and you cannot give them orders
YxZsXZeFU1A,581950,584616,and expect them to just execute like a robot would.
YxZsXZeFU1A,584798,585909,If the military was like that
YxZsXZeFU1A,585934,588139,then military leadership would be the easiest thing in the world.
YxZsXZeFU1A,588226,590591,"You know, my guys wouldn't just do what I told them"
YxZsXZeFU1A,590670,591844,because I outrank them
YxZsXZeFU1A,591868,594661,"and I kind of get that funny look, I don't know. Let me ask you this."
YxZsXZeFU1A,595049,597961,"I'm here because your employees aren't doing what you want them to do, right?"
YxZsXZeFU1A,597985,599769,Can you just fire them?
YxZsXZeFU1A,600151,602482,Don't they work for you? Aren't they supposed to follow you
YxZsXZeFU1A,602507,604505,because you're in charge and you write their paycheck
YxZsXZeFU1A,604530,607005,But all of a sudden they're not doing what you tell them to do. Why is that?
YxZsXZeFU1A,607030,608871,"It's the same exact reason, because they're people"
YxZsXZeFU1A,608895,611609,"and guess what? People want to own their own destiny,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,611634,613363,"they want to be in charge of what's happening,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,613387,616426,"they want to take ownership, they want to create the plan."
YxZsXZeFU1A,616545,618545,That's how they want to go through life.
YxZsXZeFU1A,618760,620886,They don't want to go through life being treated like a robot
YxZsXZeFU1A,620910,622623,they want to be treated like a human.
YxZsXZeFU1A,622791,623830,So...
YxZsXZeFU1A,624108,626472,"Don't talk to me about, oh well it was easy for you"
YxZsXZeFU1A,626496,629217,"because you had these highly trained, highly disciplined,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,629242,632630,"you know, terminator robots that work for you, not true."
YxZsXZeFU1A,632654,633907,In fact the opposite
YxZsXZeFU1A,633931,635549,"I had a bunch of hard-headed,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,635574,637246,"you know, the guys that you talked about earlier,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,637272,640883,"I had a bunch of hard headed, very determined,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,641811,643977,thick skulled guys
YxZsXZeFU1A,644002,647627,"that you know, I had to get them to do what I wanted them to do."
YxZsXZeFU1A,647968,649968,I had to get them to want to do
YxZsXZeFU1A,650420,651855,what I wanted them to do.
YxZsXZeFU1A,651880,654991,I had to make them think that it was what they wanted to do.
YxZsXZeFU1A,656078,657569,"That's the goal,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,657982,659434,that's what leadership is.
YxZsXZeFU1A,660116,662512,And the worse your plan is thought out
YxZsXZeFU1A,662536,664242,the less response you're going to get.
YxZsXZeFU1A,664266,665972,And just like in business world
YxZsXZeFU1A,665996,669535,the less input I get from you as we create this plan
YxZsXZeFU1A,669797,672281,the less apt you are to execute it correctly.
YxZsXZeFU1A,672305,673717,"So when, when it comes to,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,673742,676281,"when you have to go execute something, I want you to plan it"
YxZsXZeFU1A,676305,677678,I'm not going to plan it for you.
YxZsXZeFU1A,677733,678733,I want you to plan it.
YxZsXZeFU1A,678757,680558,Now I'm going to come and check out your plan
YxZsXZeFU1A,680582,682517,and we'll collaborate to make sure it's the best plan
YxZsXZeFU1A,682542,683938,because maybe I have more experience than you
YxZsXZeFU1A,683962,686287,or maybe I have some strategic vision that you don't have.
YxZsXZeFU1A,686636,688579,But I want you to plan it
YxZsXZeFU1A,688604,690056,that way you own it.
YxZsXZeFU1A,690080,691580,"And if you own it, when you go to execute it"
YxZsXZeFU1A,691604,693453,you're going to put that much more effort into it.
YxZsXZeFU1A,693977,696849,That- that's hard to quantify but that's real.
YxZsXZeFU1A,697166,699356,"That is real if you come up with a plan,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,699847,701847,you're going to put more effort
YxZsXZeFU1A,702220,704061,and more pride in executing that plan
YxZsXZeFU1A,704085,706196,then if I come up with a plan and I give it to you
YxZsXZeFU1A,706221,707331,and tell you to execute it.
YxZsXZeFU1A,707726,708972,That's just a reality.
YxZsXZeFU1A,708996,710686,"I don't, I don't, I don't care who you are."
YxZsXZeFU1A,710711,711956,That's a reality.
YxZsXZeFU1A,713138,714638,Ordering people to do things
YxZsXZeFU1A,714663,715668,does not work.
YxZsXZeFU1A,715693,717693,You actually have to lead them
YxZsXZeFU1A,717717,720899,and than another buzzword out there is this- is...
YxZsXZeFU1A,721010,722391,accountability.
YxZsXZeFU1A,722437,723389,"You know,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,723445,724453,"you gotta be accountable,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,724477,726516,"you gotta be, you gotta hold your people accountable"
YxZsXZeFU1A,726627,728627,and- and to me
YxZsXZeFU1A,728651,730016,"accountability is a tool,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,730041,732365,"it's a, it's a, it's a tool of leadership,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,732515,733895,but it's not...
YxZsXZeFU1A,734251,735933,The primary tool of leadership.
YxZsXZeFU1A,735957,737274,"It's actually a crutch,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,737298,742360,it's actually a tool to use when you don't pull off leadership correctly.
YxZsXZeFU1A,743074,745074,So what you want to do
YxZsXZeFU1A,745098,747700,"you know, I- I- I talk about this all the time"
YxZsXZeFU1A,747724,750636,"I didn't hold my guys accountable,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,751294,752294,I didn't...
YxZsXZeFU1A,752318,755389,"You know, walk down the line and inspect what they were doing and..."
YxZsXZeFU1A,755413,758032,"No, I didn't have to hold them accountable."
YxZsXZeFU1A,758056,762103,They wanted to do the right thing
YxZsXZeFU1A,762127,765047,they wanted to do what was aligned with the mission.
YxZsXZeFU1A,765071,766498,I had to hold them back
YxZsXZeFU1A,766523,767880,Never mind make them do it
YxZsXZeFU1A,767904,769062,and that's what leadership is.
YxZsXZeFU1A,769087,771055,it's not about accountability
YxZsXZeFU1A,771158,772371,it's about leading
YxZsXZeFU1A,772396,773602,and getting them to lead themselves
YxZsXZeFU1A,773628,775435,and getting them to take ownership of things
YxZsXZeFU1A,775514,776759,"That's what, that's"
YxZsXZeFU1A,776785,779141,"that's when you know, you've succeeded as a leader"
YxZsXZeFU1A,779196,781290,"when you're just about out of a job,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,781608,783766,when you're sitting back and you don't have to do anything
YxZsXZeFU1A,783790,786368,because your front line troops and your subordinate leadership
YxZsXZeFU1A,786393,789726,is making things happen with almost no effort from you.
YxZsXZeFU1A,790305,792675,And the only time you have to step in is when something is going sideways
YxZsXZeFU1A,792700,794898,"or you see something getting off-track, you got to step back in there."
YxZsXZeFU1A,794922,796390,But the ideal
YxZsXZeFU1A,796414,799707,"is that you can sit back, observe"
YxZsXZeFU1A,800293,803474,"start looking at what the other strategy is, what- what to do next,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,803499,805284,other problems in other parts of the world
YxZsXZeFU1A,805308,807735,But you can just let your people do what they want to do
YxZsXZeFU1A,807760,809228,because they want to do it
YxZsXZeFU1A,809252,812474,not because you have to breathe down their shoulder and hold them accountable
YxZsXZeFU1A,813457,814717,Not the way to lead.
YxZsXZeFU1A,815710,818400,"And to that same young man that wants to be a Seal,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,818424,821304,you know the guys that want to be like Jocko one day
YxZsXZeFU1A,821851,823851,What do you tell that- that 20 year old that
YxZsXZeFU1A,824080,826540,"sees this thing and says, I want to go do that?"
YxZsXZeFU1A,829485,831635,"Well, first of all, don't try and be like me"
YxZsXZeFU1A,832238,833634,be better than me.
YxZsXZeFU1A,835340,838300,"Crush me, make me look like a baby."
YxZsXZeFU1A,838459,840006,"That's what, that's what you do"
YxZsXZeFU1A,840244,842045,and- and don't...
YxZsXZeFU1A,842609,845608,"Don't talk about it, don't mull it over,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,845632,847132,don't plan for it
YxZsXZeFU1A,847156,848790,just get after it.
YxZsXZeFU1A,850234,851638,You get after it.
YxZsXZeFU1A,852771,854295,Make it happen.
YxZsXZeFU1A,855524,857675,Use your force of will
YxZsXZeFU1A,858040,859047,to make it happen.
YxZsXZeFU1A,859071,860610,"As a human being,"
YxZsXZeFU1A,860634,863347,the strongest thing you've got is your force of will
YxZsXZeFU1A,865402,866964,So take that force of will
YxZsXZeFU1A,866989,869425,and make that happen.
