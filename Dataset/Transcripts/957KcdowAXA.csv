957KcdowAXA,1920,4320,Oh my gosh this is so intense!
957KcdowAXA,5948,7047,Gah!
957KcdowAXA,8692,10560,Uhhhh…what the heck?
957KcdowAXA,10560,12720,Well two can play that game!
957KcdowAXA,12720,14560,But mine was an accident…
957KcdowAXA,15520,17600,Wait. What’s going on here? Are you seeing this?
957KcdowAXA,18240,18740,Yikes!
957KcdowAXA,20800,23119,Whoa! Oh my gosh! Look at you!
957KcdowAXA,23680,24240,You too!   
957KcdowAXA,26800,29840,Let’s see…WHOA! Check this out!
957KcdowAXA,29840,32480,"I got one, too! Though mine’s rainbow colored of course."
957KcdowAXA,33440,35120,Hey! I think mine’s food!
957KcdowAXA,36880,39360,Food? No way! That’s so cool!
957KcdowAXA,40400,44240,"Was he trying to give me his heart? No, I bet not."
957KcdowAXA,44240,46880,I’ll just eat my own heart now instead of worrying about his.
957KcdowAXA,46880,47840,Looks delicious.
957KcdowAXA,49280,51920,"Wait, what the heck? Is this just rubber?"
957KcdowAXA,52800,54399,Oof! I can’t even stretch it!
957KcdowAXA,55520,60880,"Guess it’s not food after all. Well, that’s a bummer."
957KcdowAXA,60880,62800,But at least I can still play with it.
957KcdowAXA,62800,65600,I dunno. I’m just not feeling it like I usually would.
957KcdowAXA,66320,69520,Aww. She looks so sad. I’ll have to do something about it.
957KcdowAXA,70000,73760,Psst. Hey. Look over here. Would you want some of my heart?
957KcdowAXA,73760,75920,Wow! I would! Thank you so much!
957KcdowAXA,76560,78399,Whoa! It snapped so easily!
957KcdowAXA,78960,81920,"Oh gosh, look at her now. She looks so happy!"
957KcdowAXA,84000,86960,I’m so glad I split this with her and that she got the bigger piece.
957KcdowAXA,88480,90640,It’s so good! I need another bite.
957KcdowAXA,90640,92320,Whoa… wait a second…
957KcdowAXA,92320,94480,You need a mirror to check out your new look!
957KcdowAXA,94480,98000,New look? What do you mean? Oh my gosh!
957KcdowAXA,99280,103119,"Now you’re black and white, just like me! A perfect match!"
957KcdowAXA,103120,105680,You really think so? Hehehe
957KcdowAXA,105680,107920,I guess we do make a stylish couple…  
957KcdowAXA,112400,115120,All right! I’m feeling pretty lucky again for this one!
957KcdowAXA,116880,118399,Wait! Hold it right there!
957KcdowAXA,118400,121360,"We’ll open together. On three, two…"
957KcdowAXA,121360,122320,Yadda yadda ONE!
957KcdowAXA,123200,126479,YES! One of my favorite foods! Milk and cookies!
957KcdowAXA,126480,128960,Nom! This looks so scrumptious.
957KcdowAXA,128960,132385,Hey! I can’t believe you skipped ahead like that! Ugh!
957KcdowAXA,132749,135200,Ugh! I wanted to open them together!
957KcdowAXA,135920,136640,"Well, whatever."
957KcdowAXA,137600,141360,"No way! I got a dessert and drink, too! Macarons and juice!"
957KcdowAXA,141360,142560,This is so colorful!
957KcdowAXA,142560,144640,Pshaaa. Who wants rainbow desserts?
957KcdowAXA,144640,146880,Chocolate cookies and white milk is where it’s at!
957KcdowAXA,146880,148560,Chocolate cookies. White milk.
957KcdowAXA,148560,151040,Oh my! You have hurt my heart!
957KcdowAXA,151040,154319,I’m so upset my cookies were insulted I might swoon!
957KcdowAXA,154320,157760,I got a secret for you: your cookies look like trash!
957KcdowAXA,158480,160480,"Oh, you’re gonna get it now!"
957KcdowAXA,160480,162159,What do you think about this move?!
957KcdowAXA,162880,163380,Done!
957KcdowAXA,164640,167040,"Argh! Well, try to do this on then!"
957KcdowAXA,167040,169840,You mean this move that you think is so cool? Too easy.
957KcdowAXA,170480,173280,All right all right. Time for my big move then…
957KcdowAXA,173280,174240,TAKE THIS!
957KcdowAXA,174880,176800,Seriously? THAT’S your big move?
957KcdowAXA,178480,181760,"Well, whatever. I’m not wasting any more of my moves on you."
957KcdowAXA,181760,182959,Wait a second…
957KcdowAXA,182960,185600,The cookie! Of course! This will be how I win.
957KcdowAXA,186240,187920,Hey! Yoo hoo! Over here!
957KcdowAXA,187920,190160,Big deal. I’ve got a macaron right here.
957KcdowAXA,190160,194560,"All right, then. The cream’s all on one side!"
957KcdowAXA,194560,196800,Voila. A perfect cookie split.
957KcdowAXA,196800,199760,That’s it? Your big move? Ridiculously easy.
957KcdowAXA,201440,204840,Oh no! My macaron totally crumbled in my hands!
957KcdowAXA,205440,208960,Hah! Your macaron was too delicate for my ultimate move!
957KcdowAXA,208960,211241,No! I can totally do it. Watch! 
957KcdowAXA,214688,215688,Argh!
957KcdowAXA,216560,218080,Wait! I’ve got more of them to try!
957KcdowAXA,221360,223680,Noooooo! They all just crumble instead!
957KcdowAXA,224640,227440,That’s what you get! I told you you couldn’t do it.
957KcdowAXA,227440,231600,And now for my reward. It’s cookie dunkin’ time!
957KcdowAXA,231600,234320,Mmm! So good! They’re still my favorite!
957KcdowAXA,235360,237760,Yep. Those are some good cookies and milk.
957KcdowAXA,238560,240640,"Well, I bet mine will still taste good."
957KcdowAXA,240640,243040,"Nothing else to do but just give them a try, I guess."
957KcdowAXA,244960,248320,It’s totally falling apart because of the liquid! No fair…  
957KcdowAXA,250160,252000,Yes! Time for another challenge!
957KcdowAXA,252000,253840,Why don’t you open yours first this time?
957KcdowAXA,253840,255200,Why don’t you go first this time?
957KcdowAXA,255760,259199,"Wait, me? Seriously? Oh my gosh I would LOVE to!"
957KcdowAXA,259760,261840,No way no way no way!
957KcdowAXA,261840,264400,Are you seeing this? It’s a whole cake!
957KcdowAXA,264400,267840,And it’s topped with pieces of cookies AND entire donuts!
957KcdowAXA,267840,269120,Isn’t it just incredible?
957KcdowAXA,270880,272640,You know what? I’m ready to dig in.
957KcdowAXA,274480,277200,Wow. I think that’s the best thing I’ve ever eaten.
957KcdowAXA,277200,280240,"Yeah, that does look pretty good, even from over here."
957KcdowAXA,280240,282319,I can’t stop eating it…
957KcdowAXA,282320,284720,Wow! You ate that whole thing in just one sitting!
957KcdowAXA,284720,286160,"But it’s time to open mine, now!"
957KcdowAXA,286891,289039,WOW! I’ve got a cake too!
957KcdowAXA,289040,290960,With donuts and candies on top!
957KcdowAXA,290960,293039,Are those marshmallows?! I think so!
957KcdowAXA,293600,296640,It’s practically a whole smorgasbord of sweet treats!
957KcdowAXA,298560,301200,Mmm! I bet it’s going to taste just as good as his!
957KcdowAXA,301709,303760,"Mm, mm, mm."
957KcdowAXA,303760,307440,It’s gonna take her forever with that spoon. Guess I’ll help!
957KcdowAXA,307440,309840,I’ll just carve out a chunk from the middle while she’s not looking.
957KcdowAXA,310400,313440,There we go! Wow! This does look tasty!
957KcdowAXA,313440,315760,She doesn’t even know I took this bit. Down the hatch!
957KcdowAXA,317320,322080,Ahh! Time for another bite! Huh? What’s this?
957KcdowAXA,322800,326319,There’s a big hole missing! And I bet I know who’s responsible.
957KcdowAXA,327360,328719,HEY! What do you think you’re doing?!
957KcdowAXA,329440,331040,What? Me? Steal you cake? No!
957KcdowAXA,331680,334160,"Well, whatever. I’m gonna try one of these toppers."
957KcdowAXA,336240,337840,I do love me some marshmallows.
957KcdowAXA,339120,340880,MMMM! So sweet!
957KcdowAXA,340880,342160,That does look good!
957KcdowAXA,342160,345200,I’ll just take a bit of this top…Come on!
957KcdowAXA,345920,347600,Yes! Into my mouth you go!
957KcdowAXA,349280,352400,Huh? What’s that noise? HEY!
957KcdowAXA,352400,355600,I can’t believe this! You’ve eaten like half my cake already!
957KcdowAXA,356240,358479,Huh? What? Me? Of course it wasn’t me.
957KcdowAXA,358480,361120,I would never do something like that. I swear.
957KcdowAXA,361920,365280,"You swear?! Well, your teeth are telling a different story!"
957KcdowAXA,366080,366639,What? What do you mean?
957KcdowAXA,368400,370280,Here. Take a look. Cake thief.
957KcdowAXA,370625,372480,Haha! See? I told you so!   
957KcdowAXA,374720,376320,What do you think? You or me first?
957KcdowAXA,376320,378720,How about rock paper scissors to decide?
957KcdowAXA,378720,381280,"Sure, all right! Rock, paper, scissors!"
957KcdowAXA,383280,386760,Bam! I got it on the second try! Time to see what I got.
957KcdowAXA,387360,389280,"Hah! You got nothing, that’s what!"
957KcdowAXA,391280,394800,Hah back at you! Your plate is just as empty as mine!
957KcdowAXA,394800,397440,"Anyway, there’s got to be a trick. Let’s check underneath."
957KcdowAXA,397440,400560,Darn. Still nothing. I just don’t get why we don’t have anything.
957KcdowAXA,402720,406240,Whoa! Did you see that? This burger came out of nowhere!
957KcdowAXA,406240,409280,"Perfect timing, too. I was getting pretty hungry."
957KcdowAXA,409280,412800,"Also, a burger sounds great. I’ve had a lot of sweets lately."
957KcdowAXA,413840,415600,Yep. It’s good all right.
957KcdowAXA,415600,418320,"Well come on, then! I also want a burger!"
957KcdowAXA,419760,423600,"Oh my gosh! Are you seeing this?! It totally worked for me, too!"
957KcdowAXA,423600,426880,My burger is so pretty! The bun is so brightly colored!
957KcdowAXA,426880,428640,Time to see if it tastes as good as it looks.
957KcdowAXA,431120,433919,Mmm. A burger is always good!
957KcdowAXA,433920,436640,Hey. Are you thinking what I’m thinking?
957KcdowAXA,436640,439200,Huh? Oh! Yeah! I get it!
957KcdowAXA,439200,441760,Come on magic table! Give us some more food!
957KcdowAXA,441760,444960,Come on! Ugh! How come it’s not working this time?
957KcdowAXA,444960,447759,Maybe it was just a onetime deal and it’s all used up.
957KcdowAXA,447760,449680,"Well, I guess we did what we could."
957KcdowAXA,449680,452080,Oh my gosh! What’s happening? And earthquake?!
957KcdowAXA,452080,455199,LOOK! All the burgers we could ever want! Catch them!
957KcdowAXA,456880,459840,This is the best ever! See how many you can get!
957KcdowAXA,459840,463199,"There’s one! Got it! Ooh, and another one over there!"
957KcdowAXA,463200,464960,"I’m really good at this game, I think!"
957KcdowAXA,464960,466560,One for me. And another for me!
957KcdowAXA,467520,469599,This is the best rain I’ve ever tasted!
957KcdowAXA,469600,470960,Hi-yah! Take that!
957KcdowAXA,470960,472319,Hey! That’s cheating!
957KcdowAXA,472320,476480,Here comes my last one! Got it! Mmm. They were all so good.
957KcdowAXA,477520,479280,Ah. I’m full.
957KcdowAXA,479280,480880,Mine look like they’re still coming!
957KcdowAXA,480880,482000,Maybe I can make them stop…
957KcdowAXA,483520,486000,No! Stop! I said stop! HELP!
957KcdowAXA,486000,489760,Hey! Stop sending him burgers! HE’s getting buried alive!
957KcdowAXA,489760,491245,Oh my gosh! He’s gone! 
957KcdowAXA,491881,493680,Don’t worry. I made it out.
957KcdowAXA,493680,496639,But I don’t think I want to see another burger for a long time.
957KcdowAXA,497885,498385,Hahaha  
957KcdowAXA,500320,502080,You ready? Let’s open them together!
957KcdowAXA,504000,506800,"Oh. It’s a bunch of little…spoons, I think."
957KcdowAXA,508000,510960,Look over here! I’ve got some white and black ice cream!
957KcdowAXA,510960,514000,"I’m gonna dig right in! Hey, wait a second…"
957KcdowAXA,514000,515680,I don’t have any utensils.
957KcdowAXA,515680,518385,If only there was something you could do…
957KcdowAXA,518960,521440,Oh right! She’s got spoons! A bunch of them!
957KcdowAXA,521440,523520,She won’t mind if I just borrow one…
957KcdowAXA,523520,525520,"Nope! Hold it right there, mister!"
957KcdowAXA,525520,527920,These spoons belong to me and me alone.
957KcdowAXA,527920,529360,Okay fine.
957KcdowAXA,529360,531920,Okay listen. I’ll trade you this ice cream for your spoon.
957KcdowAXA,532720,535199,Okay. I’m down this that trade. Here you go.
957KcdowAXA,535200,536960,"And here’s the ice cream, like we agreed."
957KcdowAXA,540800,542959,And Yoink! I’ll just be taking this back!
957KcdowAXA,542960,544240,What are you doing?!
957KcdowAXA,544240,547120,Sorry not sorry! I really like ice cream.
957KcdowAXA,547120,548760,You’re so mean to me.
957KcdowAXA,549141,552320,Hah! I win! You’re such a crybaby sometimes.
957KcdowAXA,552320,555040,Hey. Maybe you should pay attention to your spoon.
957KcdowAXA,555040,557600,Because it’s kind of melting right now in your hand.
957KcdowAXA,557600,558319,Huh? 
957KcdowAXA,558320,560000,It turned it into sherbet!
957KcdowAXA,560000,562480,Aww! But I wanted black and white ice cream!
957KcdowAXA,562480,564720,And look at how icky my hand is now!
957KcdowAXA,564720,568000,I don’t know what you’re talking about! It’s a much better dessert now!
957KcdowAXA,568000,569040,Ugh. Whatever.
957KcdowAXA,570000,573760,I got both desserts now! Because the spoons were edible all along!
957KcdowAXA,573760,575840,And I don’t need a spoon to eat ice cream.
957KcdowAXA,576480,577279,So good!
957KcdowAXA,578800,582320,Would you rather be rainbow or black and white? Let us know in the comments!
