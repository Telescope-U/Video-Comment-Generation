MB5sOpij7aU,0,5120,[Music]  if you're tricked into entering a  competition to win 16 million dollars or
MB5sOpij7aU,5120,11519,spend the rest of your life in crippling  debt what would you do i'm going to  break down the mistakes made what you
MB5sOpij7aU,11519,18800,should do and how to beat the dead games  in liar game this girl is going to  gamble her life away now here returns
MB5sOpij7aU,18800,24320,home to find a mysterious package  outside her room with a black envelope  curious she opens the package to
MB5sOpij7aU,24320,30400,discover bundles of money stacked inside  the girl can't believe what she's seeing  and reads the letter finding out she's
MB5sOpij7aU,30400,37760,been entered into the liar game  tournament and will soon be forced to  play the dirtiest tricks she can think  of in order to win examining the box the
MB5sOpij7aU,37760,43840,girl discovers there's exactly 100  million yen inside and decides to check  what's on the vhs tape putting it in the
MB5sOpij7aU,43840,49600,vcr it plays a video where a puppet  introduces itself as the dealer and  reveals that because she's watching this
MB5sOpij7aU,49600,56000,video now has agreed to participate in  the liar game with no way to back out  the dealer explains that for the first
MB5sOpij7aU,56000,61520,round of the tournament the players must  steal their opponent's money by any  means necessary and whoever has the most
MB5sOpij7aU,61520,66960,cash after 30 days will be the winner at  the end of the round an agent will be  sent to collect the money and the winner
MB5sOpij7aU,66960,72000,will be allowed to keep whatever they  stole while the loser will be forced to  pay back the full amount the girl is
MB5sOpij7aU,72000,77040,overwhelmed and goes to the police  station to make a report but the officer  tells her that since the cash has been
MB5sOpij7aU,77040,83280,sent to her by name it wasn't stolen  that means the police can't help the  girl and now here has to protect it on
MB5sOpij7aU,83280,88880,her own returning home she struggles to  figure out what to do when she suddenly  hears something fall through her mail
MB5sOpij7aU,88880,94640,slot entering the other room she opens  her mailbox to find an envelope labeled  opponent and inside is a letter
MB5sOpij7aU,94640,100000,revealing that she's competing against  her old middle school teacher but soon  she'll realize he's a lot more dangerous
MB5sOpij7aU,100000,105759,than he appears later that day now  decides to visit the man to talk about  the tournament but he tells her the game
MB5sOpij7aU,105759,111600,is actually a scam he thinks the  organizers will secretly steal the money  given to the players and force them into
MB5sOpij7aU,111600,116960,debt it makes perfect sense to her and  he suggests they keep both of their  money in a safety deposit box so the
MB5sOpij7aU,116960,123200,organizers can't take it back the girls  relieved he can help and hands over her  bag of cash but this was her biggest
MB5sOpij7aU,123200,128560,mistake now what's terrifying is that  this is only the first of many games  she'll be trapped into play and if she
MB5sOpij7aU,128560,134959,doesn't learn how to think for herself  then it's only going to get worse  okay this girl is a complete idiot she
MB5sOpij7aU,134959,141360,should have known that handing over the  money was a terrible idea but the worst  part about this is that everything her  teacher said was something she could
MB5sOpij7aU,141360,146480,have easily done herself without his  help now to give her some credit it  should first go without saying that in a
MB5sOpij7aU,146480,152000,game like this it's smart to not trust  any information you've been given for  all we know the teacher might actually
MB5sOpij7aU,152000,158560,be right and this could be some kind of  scam because if someone is willing to  give out a combined total of 1.5 million
MB5sOpij7aU,158560,164319,us dollars to two strangers it's  reasonable to assume that there must be  a catch and that the person most likely
MB5sOpij7aU,164319,169920,to benefit from this is not you nobody  spends that kind of money without  getting something for it in return and
MB5sOpij7aU,169920,175519,it's extremely likely that it will be at  your expense the problem is that this is  not the only way to think about this
MB5sOpij7aU,175519,181680,scenario because if the game is real and  the rules are true then she's obviously  going to lose by handing him the money
MB5sOpij7aU,181680,187040,if it were me i would have called his  bluff and accepted his offer to help but  would then insist that we go to the bank
MB5sOpij7aU,187040,192159,together to make sure the money was  deposited this would then force the  teacher to admit he was lying because
MB5sOpij7aU,192159,199040,the man should already know if you take  1.5 million dollars and ask to secure it  in a deposit box there's a very low
MB5sOpij7aU,199040,204560,chance the bank would even let you do it  most banks put limitations on the value  of the items because they're actually a
MB5sOpij7aU,204560,210480,lot less safe and they don't want to be  held liable if it's stolen even worse  storing that much money in cash makes it
MB5sOpij7aU,210480,215680,look like you're trying to hide it from  the irs if it looks like we acquired  this money illegally then they're a lot
MB5sOpij7aU,215680,222239,more likely to deny our application and  without any paperwork to prove it's ours  this is not a viable option now if this
MB5sOpij7aU,222239,227360,girl doesn't know who to trust it would  have been much smarter to take the  teacher's advice but keep her money
MB5sOpij7aU,227360,232799,locked up ensuring that she won't lose  the game normal should be tempted into  spending the money and falling for some
MB5sOpij7aU,232799,238159,kind of scam instead of thinking this  through she decided to hinge everything  on the belief that her middle school
MB5sOpij7aU,238159,243599,teacher was a good person now as stupid  as this might seem you'd be surprised  how often we make the same mistakes in
MB5sOpij7aU,243599,249120,our daily lives and it's actually known  as heuristic thinking when we encounter  a very complex choice with a lot of
MB5sOpij7aU,249120,254400,different factors the human mind has a  way of shortcutting our problem-solving  by generalizing it until you reach
MB5sOpij7aU,254400,260320,what's called a cognitive bias and that  means you're statistically more likely  to draw inaccurate conclusions even
MB5sOpij7aU,260320,265440,though you've used a logical framework  to get there for example this girl has  known this man personally for three
MB5sOpij7aU,265440,271280,years has had no negative experiences  with him in the past and he's offering  to help this makes it easier for her to
MB5sOpij7aU,271280,276639,trust him than to trust the game and  it's exactly the kind of cognitive bias  that contributes to making the worst
MB5sOpij7aU,276639,282479,choice possible that night the girl  arrives home and discovers that the  organizers have sent another letter this
MB5sOpij7aU,282479,288479,time it warns her that she's now 100  million yen in debt and is losing the  game worried she calls her teacher to
MB5sOpij7aU,288479,295199,ask what happened with the money and the  man explains that the letter is a trick  meant to make them suspicious of each  other believing him now decides to
MB5sOpij7aU,295199,300720,apologize for doubting her teacher and  visits the man the next day but as she  approaches him the girl overhears
MB5sOpij7aU,300720,306080,something that breaks her heart on the  phone he brags to his friend that he  tricked her into giving him money and
MB5sOpij7aU,306080,311759,she was stupid enough to trust him the  next morning she tries to report the  theft to the police officer but the man
MB5sOpij7aU,311759,317280,explained she can't prove her money was  stolen because she gave it away  willingly instead he suggests she get
MB5sOpij7aU,317280,322800,advice from a con artist who's just  finished his sentence and with no better  option she decides to look for him
MB5sOpij7aU,322800,327840,arriving at the prison where the man is  being released the girl is suddenly  knocked to the ground and when she looks
MB5sOpij7aU,327840,334400,up she sees it's the con artist the girl  begs akiyama here for help but the man  isn't interested and quickly walks away
MB5sOpij7aU,334400,341039,she chases after him refusing to take no  for an answer so he promises to hear her  out she tells him about the liar's game
MB5sOpij7aU,341039,346800,explaining that the money was stolen and  the con man quickly comes up with a plan  they visit her teacher asking him to
MB5sOpij7aU,346800,352639,give all the money back but the old man  insists that it's not going to happen  the safety deposit box he used can't be
MB5sOpij7aU,352639,358800,accessed after 5 pm on weekdays but  that's when now calls him out revealing  she heard him brag about stealing the
MB5sOpij7aU,358800,364240,money the con man threatens to call the  police unless he gives it back but the  teacher argues that he didn't commit a
MB5sOpij7aU,364240,370400,crime according to the tournament rules  with his lie exposed the man and mislead  tricked the girl but tells them he needs
MB5sOpij7aU,370400,376800,the money more than she does and will do  whatever it takes to win that night now  is ready to give up but this time the
MB5sOpij7aU,376800,383280,con man has a different plan the teacher  mentioned that the safety deposit box  can't be accessed after 5 pm on weekdays
MB5sOpij7aU,383280,388639,and the girl realizes the last day of  the game is on a sunday this means the  teacher will have to withdraw the money
MB5sOpij7aU,388639,395120,on friday and that's when they'll take  it from him but akiyama only offers to  help if she pays him 50 million yen that
MB5sOpij7aU,395120,400800,means he'll have to steal the teacher's  money to pay for his service and with no  other option the girl agrees the next
MB5sOpij7aU,400800,406000,morning now visits her teacher and  threatens that she's going to take all  his cash before running off it's a part
MB5sOpij7aU,406000,411520,of their plan to make him paranoid about  what they might do and trick him into  making a mistake over the passing days
MB5sOpij7aU,411520,417440,the two of them spy on the teacher and  constantly watch every move he makes  with only seven days left the girl is
MB5sOpij7aU,417440,423039,nervous that they've been wasting time  but akiyama explains they're waiting for  the perfect moment to strike the old man
MB5sOpij7aU,423039,428080,will get more paranoid the longer he  waits for them to make a move and his  behavior has already revealed something
MB5sOpij7aU,428080,435599,important he hasn't left his house in  weeks and the only possible reason is  that he's protecting the money he's  hidden there okay this girl has not
MB5sOpij7aU,435599,442560,learned her lesson she already made the  mistake of trusting her middle school  teacher but she should have realized  that a con man would be even more likely
MB5sOpij7aU,442560,448479,to take advantage of her this guy just  got out of jail and probably doesn't  have a single yen to his name according
MB5sOpij7aU,448479,453599,to the game the money technically  doesn't belong to either of the players  so it would be easy for him to steal all
MB5sOpij7aU,453599,459120,the cash and disappear without a trace  it should go without saying that the  more people you involve the more you'll
MB5sOpij7aU,459120,464879,have to worry about getting betrayed  which makes asking for help a very risky  strategy unfortunately it's clear the
MB5sOpij7aU,464879,470080,girl won't be able to win this game  alone so it was the only choice she had  now what's interesting is that this
MB5sOpij7aU,470080,476400,scenario is very similar to a problem in  game theory called the trust gate as you  can see from this diagram there's a lot
MB5sOpij7aU,476400,482800,happening underneath but on the surface  it's really simple in 1995 economists  set up an experiment to find out how
MB5sOpij7aU,482800,488319,much trust would influence economic  decision making and paired two strangers  together both were given some money and
MB5sOpij7aU,488319,494240,the first player is told to choose how  much to give away whatever he decides  that sum will be tripled and given to
MB5sOpij7aU,494240,499759,the second player then the second player  is told to choose how much money he  wants to return the researchers
MB5sOpij7aU,499759,505360,predicted that both players would choose  to act selfishly and give nothing to  their opponent but they were completely
MB5sOpij7aU,505360,511520,wrong what they found was that 94 of the  first players would give away over half  of their money tripling the amount for
MB5sOpij7aU,511520,516880,the second player so there was more for  them to give back that means if they  both started with ten dollars then by
MB5sOpij7aU,516880,523279,playing cooperatively they could end the  game with 15 each or play selfishly and  end up with less now the difference here
MB5sOpij7aU,523279,528880,is that in this game there can only be  one winner but that doesn't mean there  have to be any losers if the girl and
MB5sOpij7aU,528880,534959,the teacher had discussed whether or not  it was worth it to risk spending the  rest of their life in crippling debt  they both might have come to the
MB5sOpij7aU,534959,540880,conclusion that they have more to gain  if they cooperate and trust each other  to return their own cash after 30 days
MB5sOpij7aU,540880,546080,neither of them would win but it's the  only outcome where they both don't lose  now the teacher made a huge mistake
MB5sOpij7aU,546080,551519,taking all the money because he left his  opponent with no other strategy than to  steal and entrapped him into only being
MB5sOpij7aU,551519,557600,able to protect the money without any  other strategic options in game theory  this is known as the nash equilibrium
MB5sOpij7aU,557600,564399,where knowing what the other player will  do doesn't change the strategy or the  outcome you might recognize this name  from the movie a beautiful mind which is
MB5sOpij7aU,564399,569839,about the man who the theory is named  after now if i were the teacher i would  have realized it's a lot smarter to have
MB5sOpij7aU,569839,575440,stolen half of her money and then  threatened to steal the other half it  might sound counterintuitive but this
MB5sOpij7aU,575440,580959,would actually force the girl to choose  whether or not to protect what she  already has or risk it being stolen to
MB5sOpij7aU,580959,586000,try getting the rest of it back this is  the best decision the teacher could make  because if he leaves her with this
MB5sOpij7aU,586000,591839,choice she won't be spending all of her  time trying to steal from him making his  money safer from being stolen the next
MB5sOpij7aU,591839,597519,morning the teacher wakes up to find  smoke filling the room panicking he's  about to run outside but stays behind to
MB5sOpij7aU,597519,604240,let the smoke out instead he pulls out  his phone to call the fire department  when he suddenly hears a noise behind  him and turns around to see his opponent
MB5sOpij7aU,604240,609440,standing outside akiyama reveals they  tricked him to thinking there was a fire  so they could figure out where the money
MB5sOpij7aU,609440,614640,was hidden and the teacher admits that  it's in the house but they'll never be  able to take it all the cash has been
MB5sOpij7aU,614640,620160,locked inside a heavy duty safe but the  con man makes it clear that this won't  stop them from winning the game they
MB5sOpij7aU,620160,626000,leave the house as the man panics that  he's going to lose all the money but  akiyama has one last trick up his sleeve
MB5sOpij7aU,626000,631120,the next night the teacher checks his  mail and discovers a letter from the  game designers it warns him that
MB5sOpij7aU,631120,637200,tomorrow at 5 pm an agent will be sent  to collect the money and announce the  end of the first game the next morning
MB5sOpij7aU,637200,642720,the teacher keeps watch over his house  and protects the safe until there's only  10 minutes left before the round ends
MB5sOpij7aU,642720,649360,desperate now here begs the con man to  do something or else they'll lose but he  stays quiet it seems he's given up and
MB5sOpij7aU,649360,654959,the girl leaves the room disappointed  that she ever trusted him arriving at  the teacher's house she begs him to give
MB5sOpij7aU,654959,661279,back her money but he refuses and pushes  her to the ground there's nothing she  can do as the clock hits 5 pm and the
MB5sOpij7aU,661279,667040,man realizes he's won the agent has  already arrived in the house and the  teacher invites him inside to show him
MB5sOpij7aU,667040,673279,the cash unlocking the safe the man lets  him count the 200 million yen and  celebrates his victory but this was his
MB5sOpij7aU,673279,679120,biggest mistake one hour later the agent  is almost done checking the cash when  they hear the doorbell suddenly ring
MB5sOpij7aU,679120,684399,confused the teacher walks to the front  door finding more agents have come to  collect the money and that's when the
MB5sOpij7aU,684399,690240,other man walks past them to leave he  realizes something's wrong and runs back  to his living room to find the con man
MB5sOpij7aU,690240,696399,waiting for him akiyama reveals that the  first agent was an imposter he hired and  he replaced his letter with a fake one
MB5sOpij7aU,696399,702480,the real agents were supposed to come  here at 6pm and that means the teacher  has just lost the game with the round
MB5sOpij7aU,702480,708800,officially over now here is deemed the  winner and gets to keep 100 million yen  as a reward the girl heads back home
MB5sOpij7aU,708800,713839,with her new friend but she realizes  that her teacher won't be able to pay  back his own debt and will ruin him for
MB5sOpij7aU,713839,719440,life feeling guilty she returns to his  house and offers him half of the money  she wants so he can pay back some of his
MB5sOpij7aU,719440,724959,debt but that was her biggest mistake  okay this girl is way too nice her own
MB5sOpij7aU,724959,730160,middle school teacher was a moments away  from putting her in crippling debt and  now she's giving him half of her
MB5sOpij7aU,730160,736160,winnings she also has to pay the con man  the other half for his help and it  leaves her with nothing left now luckily
MB5sOpij7aU,736160,743200,they managed to win the game but the  problem with their strategy is that if  one thing went wrong their opponent  would have easily won if anything raised
MB5sOpij7aU,743200,748639,to suspicions they would only have one  hour to come up with a new plan and  that's not something i'd be willing to
MB5sOpij7aU,748639,754160,risk we need as much time on our site as  possible and that's why i would have  tried to steal his money a lot sooner
MB5sOpij7aU,754160,760000,one of the most important details is  that the rules explicitly state any  action taken to steal the money won't be
MB5sOpij7aU,760000,766079,treated as a crime now this is a very  strange rule because if it's true it  implies that law enforcement is not only
MB5sOpij7aU,766079,772240,aware of the game but also controlled by  the liar game agency earlier the girl  went to this policeman after her money
MB5sOpij7aU,772240,779040,was stolen but she didn't stop to  realize how strange it was that the  local law enforcement was recommending  she find a criminal to help her there's
MB5sOpij7aU,779040,784720,no way that would happen unless he was  already working for the game and if this  is true then we have a lot more options
MB5sOpij7aU,784720,790320,that should be explored because it means  we could break it to his house tie him  down or even kill him without getting in
MB5sOpij7aU,790320,795839,trouble for it now there's no reason to  take it that far but understanding our  options is essential for making sure we
MB5sOpij7aU,795839,801360,have a plan that gives us the best  chance of success and waiting until one  hour before the game ends is not the
MB5sOpij7aU,801360,807279,best strategy here if it were me i would  wait until he's asleep break into his  house with a weapon and lie that we will
MB5sOpij7aU,807279,812639,kill him if he doesn't open the safe  this forces him to choose between his  life or the money and that's something
MB5sOpij7aU,812639,818720,he won't much to risk trying to color  bluff the game has given us the freedom  to use brute force as a solution with no
MB5sOpij7aU,818720,825040,consequences and not trying this first  to be a terrible waste of an opportunity  that night now here is walking home when
MB5sOpij7aU,825040,830480,she sees akiyama waiting for her and he  hands over his half of the winnings he's  had a change of heart and the girl
MB5sOpij7aU,830480,835760,leaves to take the briefcase to the  teacher relieved that the man will be  able to pay back his debt in full later
MB5sOpij7aU,835760,841199,she takes akiyama back to her place but  as the girl checks her mail she  discovers something horrifying it's
MB5sOpij7aU,841199,847839,another letter from the organizers  announcing that she's qualified for the  second round of the liar game but  there's a catch they sit down to watch
MB5sOpij7aU,847839,853519,the video that was sent and the dealer  tells her that she has two choices now  can either keep playing or pay back half
MB5sOpij7aU,853519,861360,her winnings and drop out of the  tournament but if she doesn't choose in  time the agency will force her to return  the entire 100 million yen by any means
MB5sOpij7aU,861360,867360,necessary she's already given away all  her money and they both realize they  have no choice but to continue playing
MB5sOpij7aU,867360,874079,the next morning the girl goes to the  mansion where the next game will be held  and the agent instructs her to wear this  name plate before opening the doors
MB5sOpij7aU,874079,879839,revealing a room full of other  contestants suddenly a tv screen turns  on and the dealer welcomes them to the
MB5sOpij7aU,879839,885839,second round but that's when the con man  walks in announcing he's joined the  tournament the girl is shocked and the
MB5sOpij7aU,885839,891279,man explains he came to stop her from  playing but now he's stuck here just  like the rest of them he's about to tell
MB5sOpij7aU,891279,897120,her what happened but suddenly the doors  close and the dealer begins to explain  the rules everyone has tiny gems
MB5sOpij7aU,897120,903519,attached to their nameplates that are  each worth 100 million yen and must  compete for the grand price of 2.1
MB5sOpij7aU,903519,909839,billion yen in this game one player will  be chosen to ask a yes or no question  and the others will have six hours to
MB5sOpij7aU,909839,914959,vote on an answer everyone who chose the  answer with the least amount of votes  will be allowed to stay while the losers
MB5sOpij7aU,914959,920880,must drop out of the tournament and go  100 million yen in debt this will  continue until there are no more than
MB5sOpij7aU,920880,926720,two players remaining and if the winners  refuse to play in the next round half of  their money will be taken with the rules
MB5sOpij7aU,926720,933279,explained the dealer tells the players  that they will host a practice round  before the real challenge starts  tomorrow almost everyone is nervous
MB5sOpij7aU,933279,938720,about their chances and now approaches  the con man curious to know how he  became a player akiyama explains that he
MB5sOpij7aU,938720,945440,came to stop her from joining the second  round but when he arrived he met a  player who was robbed by another  participant the agent offered him a
MB5sOpij7aU,945440,950639,chance to take someone's place but now  he's gambling with his life just like  the others later the players are
MB5sOpij7aU,950639,955839,gathering the rehearsal room and one of  them is chosen to create a question  walking up to the front she asks the
MB5sOpij7aU,955839,961440,players are you a woman and they're  given these cards with either yes or no  on them they must use these to vote but
MB5sOpij7aU,961440,967600,the dealer warns if both cards are put  into the box or they fail to vote on  time they'll be disqualified for the
MB5sOpij7aU,967600,973199,practice round they'll be given 10  minutes and the timer begins counting  down looking around now realizes that
MB5sOpij7aU,973199,978639,there are more male players than female  so she should be in the minority but  with time running out everyone places
MB5sOpij7aU,978639,984240,their votes in the ballot box  okay this game is a lot more intense  instead of trying to predict the actions
MB5sOpij7aU,984240,989440,of one player we now have 21 other  people we have to take into  consideration and every single one of
MB5sOpij7aU,989440,994959,them is willing to screw us over to win  the game this is not going to be easy to  find a good strategy for but luckily
MB5sOpij7aU,994959,1000639,this scenario is actually a real problem  that's studied in game theory and it's  known as the el feral bar problem the
MB5sOpij7aU,1000639,1007040,idea is that every night there are a  hundred people who want to visit the el  faro bar but it can only hold 60. if any
MB5sOpij7aU,1007040,1012560,more than that shows up it will be too  crowded but everyone must decide at the  same time whether to go or not with no
MB5sOpij7aU,1012560,1017920,knowledge of the other people's choices  this is very similar to the situation  these players are facing because they
MB5sOpij7aU,1017920,1024480,all want to be in the minority but the  good news is that we can talk to our  opponents to collect data and it might  help us to manipulate them to vote one
MB5sOpij7aU,1024480,1030240,way instead of another now surprisingly  there's actually a mathematical solution  to the el faro bar problem but it only
MB5sOpij7aU,1030240,1035438,works with more data from previous  experiments and since this is just the  first test round we need to figure out
MB5sOpij7aU,1035438,1041678,how people will vote without this  equation for the time being we already  know there are more men than there are  women and that means if everyone votes
MB5sOpij7aU,1041678,1047199,according to their gender the women will  automatically win as the minority as  soon as the men figure this out it's
MB5sOpij7aU,1047199,1052559,guaranteed that some of them will vote  the other way and all it takes is three  men to lie for the minority to switch
MB5sOpij7aU,1052559,1059039,there might be some women who figure  this out as well and change their votes  but it's more likely that there will be  a lot more from the current majority to
MB5sOpij7aU,1059039,1064559,switch votes than the other way around  with all that in mind the obvious  solution for now here is to vote no and
MB5sOpij7aU,1064559,1069919,see what happens and even though we  can't use a strategy for every round  it's going to give us the best chance at
MB5sOpij7aU,1069919,1076960,passing this test the results are  counted revealing that 15 people voted  yes and only 7 answered no shocked the
MB5sOpij7aU,1076960,1082160,girl doesn't understand how that's  possible since there are only nine women  but the dealer explains that the truth
MB5sOpij7aU,1082160,1087600,doesn't matter in this game the goal is  to be part of the group with the least  votes and they need to trick the others
MB5sOpij7aU,1087600,1093039,to vote for the majority afterwards an  agent tells the players they'll be  disqualified if they leave and with no
MB5sOpij7aU,1093039,1098880,better option they all decide to stay  upstairs akiyama here comes up with a  clever plan explaining to the girl that
MB5sOpij7aU,1098880,1104320,they'll need to form an eight-man team  if they all join forces to split their  votes evenly between yes and no then
MB5sOpij7aU,1104320,1110799,they can ensure at least one of the  members will win the grand prize then  the winner can drop out of the  tournament paying the quitter's fee and
MB5sOpij7aU,1110799,1115919,whatever is left will be shared with the  others that way they'll each get at  least 40 million yen but there's a
MB5sOpij7aU,1115919,1121440,problem the player that akiyama replaced  had all of her money stolen and that  thief is someone in this tournament but
MB5sOpij7aU,1121440,1127120,the only thing they know is that it's a  woman if she joined the team she could  easily betray them but that's when now
MB5sOpij7aU,1127120,1132559,has an idea the girl realizes if they  don't have any other women in the group  the thief can't take advantage of their
MB5sOpij7aU,1132559,1138400,strategy and leaves the room to look for  allies she comes back with six other men  and with the group assembled akiyama has
MB5sOpij7aU,1138400,1143600,them sign a contract promising that the  winner will split the money but one of  the men asks who the mysterious thief
MB5sOpij7aU,1143600,1149360,might be now admits that they think it's  the woman in the sunglasses and the nerd  agrees he figures that since she must
MB5sOpij7aU,1149360,1155039,have stolen the check the woman isn't  scared of losing and going into debt it  makes perfect sense and the group is
MB5sOpij7aU,1155039,1160799,confident they'll win with no idea that  there's already a traitor among them the  next morning the players gather for the
MB5sOpij7aU,1160799,1166400,first round of the game and the geek is  instructed to come to the stage standing  at the front he asks if beaches are
MB5sOpij7aU,1166400,1172480,better than mountains the team members  spend the next six hours gathering  information on their opponents and they  all cast their votes in the final
MB5sOpij7aU,1172480,1178559,seconds of the game the results are  counted and the first round ends with 10  yeses versus 12 knows everything is
MB5sOpij7aU,1178559,1184320,going to plan so far but the woman with  the sunglasses survived the round and it  only makes her more suspicious
MB5sOpij7aU,1184320,1191120,okay this was brutal 12 players just got  kicked out of the game but the good news  is that so far akiyama's strategy seems
MB5sOpij7aU,1191120,1197120,to be working he split his team in two  with four of them voting yes and four of  them voting no this guarantees that at
MB5sOpij7aU,1197120,1202720,least one member of the group will stay  into the last round and is contractually  obligated to share the reward money the
MB5sOpij7aU,1202720,1208000,biggest problem here is that cooperation  also makes it more vulnerable for others  to take advantage but akiyama didn't
MB5sOpij7aU,1208000,1213360,realize that there was an even better  way to guarantee winning the game we  have to encourage cooperation as much as
MB5sOpij7aU,1213360,1219200,possible and that's why if it were me  instead of gathering the men i would do  the exact opposite and gather the women
MB5sOpij7aU,1219200,1224240,to form our team based on what we  currently know we can assume that the  thief is likely to be in the group and
MB5sOpij7aU,1224240,1229840,that's exactly what we want including  the thief will help us identify her more  quickly and ancient wisdom tells us to
MB5sOpij7aU,1229840,1235440,keep your friends close and your enemies  closer this will allow you to monitor  their activity and plan against it
MB5sOpij7aU,1235440,1242240,anything that limits your opponent's  options is often the best strategy and  when there's already a good incentive to  cooperate it's very possible that they
MB5sOpij7aU,1242240,1248480,will agree to the terms instead of  working against us with 10 players still  remaining the con man realizes his idea
MB5sOpij7aU,1248480,1253840,might go wrong but insists they stick  with the strategy that's when this guy  is chosen to present the next question
MB5sOpij7aU,1253840,1259280,and walks to the stage asking the group  whether or not they're all sadists  feeling something's wrong the con man
MB5sOpij7aU,1259280,1265760,tells now to vote no in this round while  he votes yes and the girl is confused  but follows his advice overhearing them
MB5sOpij7aU,1265760,1271520,the nerd confronts him wanting to know  why akiyama suddenly switched votes and  he tells the man not to worry about it
MB5sOpij7aU,1271520,1276559,with that cleared up the players make  their choices and when the ballots are  counted the results show that six people
MB5sOpij7aU,1276559,1282080,have voted no now here has just lost the  round and leaves the tournament hopeful  that her team will win but when she
MB5sOpij7aU,1282080,1287280,looks back the girl sees something  shocking the woman with the sunglasses  is still in the game and if she's the
MB5sOpij7aU,1287280,1293120,thief she might ruin akiyama's plan the  next morning the remaining four players  begin the third round of the game and
MB5sOpij7aU,1293120,1298320,the nerd is called to present a question  standing in front of the group he asks  them if he will win and the timer starts
MB5sOpij7aU,1298320,1303600,counting down afterwards he approaches  akiyama and double checks with him so he  knows how they're supposed to vote if
MB5sOpij7aU,1303600,1309200,all goes according to plan this round  will finally end but soon everyone will  know who the thief is later the
MB5sOpij7aU,1309200,1314880,participants are casting their votes and  the nerd notices the con man is folding  his card into a small square curious he
MB5sOpij7aU,1314880,1320400,asks him why and the guy tells him this  will guarantee it's picked last he puts  his voting card into the ballot box and
MB5sOpij7aU,1320400,1326400,the agent begins to announce the results  revealing that at least two people have  both chosen to answer no that means only
MB5sOpij7aU,1326400,1332480,one team member needs to choose yes for  them to win and suddenly now here bursts  into the room she came back to check how
MB5sOpij7aU,1332480,1337760,the game went along with the other  losers and they're told to watch from  the sidelines noticing how happy she is
MB5sOpij7aU,1337760,1342799,this woman asks why the girl is so  excited and the nerd interrupts  revealing they formed a team together
MB5sOpij7aU,1342799,1348080,but then he calls her an idiot he was  only pretending to work with them and  was actually the thief the whole time
MB5sOpij7aU,1348080,1353679,showing everyone the check he stole from  another player to make matters worse his  signature on the contract was faked
MB5sOpij7aU,1353679,1358799,meaning he doesn't have to share any of  the prize money with them the girl  doesn't understand why he's so confident
MB5sOpij7aU,1358799,1364640,he'd win but the nerd decides to explain  his master plan he copied akiyama's  strategy and formed two other teams of
MB5sOpij7aU,1364640,1370480,his own ensuring that he would always be  in the minority because he was a member  of all three teams but only casting one
MB5sOpij7aU,1370480,1375919,vote which tipped the scales by knowing  exactly what the others would choose and  being the tiebreaker he could pass each
MB5sOpij7aU,1375919,1382720,vote safely without anyone else knowing  okay this guy is a genius after joining  akiyama's team he realized that there
MB5sOpij7aU,1382720,1388240,were exactly enough players to make the  strategy work for his own self-interest  and managed to trick everyone else that
MB5sOpij7aU,1388240,1393440,he was on their side too but there's one  possible strategy that could have  completely undermined his ability to
MB5sOpij7aU,1393440,1399760,pull this off earlier all the players  were given these nameplates which  represent the money they're each  gambling with the agent even warned the
MB5sOpij7aU,1399760,1405280,girl she needs to keep it with her at  all times and that means if it goes  missing she might not be able to gamble
MB5sOpij7aU,1405280,1410559,or continue playing now they've already  spent a single night here and it's  reasonable to assume the nameplates will
MB5sOpij7aU,1410559,1416000,likely be taken off before they go to  sleep this creates a very interesting  opportunity because if someone forgets
MB5sOpij7aU,1416000,1421679,to lock their door at night we could  easily walk inside their rooms and steal  100 million yen without anyone knowing
MB5sOpij7aU,1421679,1428240,if this strategy was recognized by any  of these players and somebody cast a  vote without their nameplate the next  morning that person's vote might be
MB5sOpij7aU,1428240,1433600,disqualified and something like this  could easily tip the skills from a  majority to a minority we don't know if
MB5sOpij7aU,1433600,1439600,the strategy is against the rules but  there's good reason to think it should  be possible it's already been  established in the previous game that
MB5sOpij7aU,1439600,1446159,taking someone's money was not only  allowed but encouraged and they even let  the thief participate in the second  round after he stole the woman's check
MB5sOpij7aU,1446159,1451360,so it's reasonable to assume that it's  fair for us to keep stealing during the  game now if we were paying attention
MB5sOpij7aU,1451360,1456960,there were plenty of signs that told us  this guy was a lot more suspicious than  he looks during their first meeting now
MB5sOpij7aU,1456960,1462720,here admitted that there was a thief in  the game but the nerd immediately  pointed out why the girl in the  sunglasses was the most suspicious
MB5sOpij7aU,1462720,1468000,player and suggested they should all  look for reasons to prove she's the  thief he also kept asking akiyama who
MB5sOpij7aU,1468000,1473279,he's voting for even though his  instructions were already given this is  suspicious behavior and the more nosy
MB5sOpij7aU,1473279,1478400,someone is the more likely they want to  use that information for their own  agenda if i were akiyama i would have
MB5sOpij7aU,1478400,1483600,started considering him a risk based on  his behavior and try to take precautions  in case something unexpected happened
MB5sOpij7aU,1483600,1489760,when we look at the situation from this  perspective there were plenty of signs  that would have given us enough reason  to single the nerd out and decide to
MB5sOpij7aU,1489760,1495200,steal his nameplate as insurance in case  he betrays us if our suspicions were  wrong then we could simply return the
MB5sOpij7aU,1495200,1500480,nameplate during his vote and continue  the game suddenly the agent announced  that the nerd has voted yes and he's
MB5sOpij7aU,1500480,1506159,moments away from winning the game but  to everyone's surprise that's when it's  revealed that akiyama voted yes as well
MB5sOpij7aU,1506159,1511520,that means the votes are tied and there  will have to be another round but the  nerd is furious demanding to know how
MB5sOpij7aU,1511520,1517200,his plan went wrong amused the con man  explains he figured someone else must  have copied his idea after almost
MB5sOpij7aU,1517200,1522400,everyone lost in the first vote but  nobody looked upset the only reason  they'd be calm was if they had a
MB5sOpij7aU,1522400,1528320,strategy that guaranteed they would win  but akiyama was smart enough to realize  the nerd was the thief a long time ago
MB5sOpij7aU,1528320,1533840,the first question was why the mystery  thief was disguised themselves but the  con man realized that it would only make
MB5sOpij7aU,1533840,1539679,sense if they were playing as a proxy  for someone else the nerd has a gender  neutral name on his nameplate and it
MB5sOpij7aU,1539679,1544960,helped him hide that he was playing in  place of a female friend he dressed up  as a woman to participate in the liar's
MB5sOpij7aU,1544960,1550559,game but used his disguise to take  advantage of the other player and steal  her cash before the game began once he
MB5sOpij7aU,1550559,1556159,was inside he took off his disguise and  nobody would suspect it was him because  they thought the culprit was female he
MB5sOpij7aU,1556159,1561919,then tried to convince them the woman in  the sunglasses was the thief but akiyama  explains he made one huge mistake
MB5sOpij7aU,1561919,1567600,earlier he mentioned that the woman must  have stolen a check instead of cash but  nobody else knew that information and it
MB5sOpij7aU,1567600,1573520,gave away that this nerd was the thief  furious the man argues that he still has  one more round to win the game and they
MB5sOpij7aU,1573520,1579760,continue playing but this time the agent  chooses akiyama to ask the final  question stepping up to the platform he
MB5sOpij7aU,1579760,1585039,asks whether or not the most important  thing in life is money and suddenly  shows his card to the entire room before
MB5sOpij7aU,1585039,1591600,dropping it into the box the others  can't believe what he's doing but the  con man explains that with only three  players left to vote it will be
MB5sOpij7aU,1591600,1597279,impossible for the last player to join  the minority and he's guaranteed to win  they now have six hours to vote and this
MB5sOpij7aU,1597279,1602640,man tries to figure out what the others  will do when he suddenly has a clever  idea approaching the nerd he suggests
MB5sOpij7aU,1602640,1607919,they form a new team splitting their  votes between the two choices so neither  of them will lose it's a decent strategy
MB5sOpij7aU,1607919,1613200,but the nerd points out that everyone  else has overheard his plan and now  they'll end up locked in a tie that's
MB5sOpij7aU,1613200,1620080,when the woman approaches them and drops  a truth bomb revealing that all he has  to do to beat the con man is to form a  larger team of three the men find it
MB5sOpij7aU,1620080,1625679,hard to believe and point out there  won't be enough money to pay off the  debts of the other team members but the  woman plans on moving on to the next
MB5sOpij7aU,1625679,1631120,round that means half of their earnings  won't be taken by the agents and demands  a larger cut of the reward money leaving
MB5sOpij7aU,1631120,1637520,a little over 1 million yen for the nerd  as punishment for his betrayal okay this  was a risky strategy but there's still a
MB5sOpij7aU,1637520,1642720,good chance that it will pay off if  we're careful akiyama used his time  wisely by casting his vote first for
MB5sOpij7aU,1642720,1648480,everyone to see and this move instantly  gave him the upper hand the next player  is forced to vote yes since the only
MB5sOpij7aU,1648480,1653679,other choice is to join the majority  which would make him instantly lose this  strategy could have actually been used
MB5sOpij7aU,1653679,1659039,earlier in the game as well but it would  have been much less effective the reason  is because when there are more people
MB5sOpij7aU,1659039,1665440,it's harder to visualize the final  result but in a group of four the  players are able to see how each vote  will affect the final outcome what's
MB5sOpij7aU,1665440,1670480,most interesting is that nobody rushed  in to be the second player to vote we  want to make sure that our vote isn't
MB5sOpij7aU,1670480,1675919,trapped in the majority and whoever  votes second will be safer but whoever  votes third is more likely to lose
MB5sOpij7aU,1675919,1681279,because he becomes the majority no  matter what side he chooses the fourth  player has a chance to tie the game but
MB5sOpij7aU,1681279,1687039,if nobody else shows their votes before  casting it they might choose the wrong  side and force a majority by accident as
MB5sOpij7aU,1687039,1693279,the second voter this gives you a 33  chance to win and that's a lot better  than zero forming a new team also has
MB5sOpij7aU,1693279,1698480,less benefit now because if they win  they're contractually bound to share all  the earnings and since there will be two
MB5sOpij7aU,1698480,1703840,full teams to split it with instead of  one they'll only get half as much as  before this woman completely changed the
MB5sOpij7aU,1703840,1710000,dynamics here because she decided she  would play in the third round which  doubles the prize money and this makes  team building a worthwhile strategy
MB5sOpij7aU,1710000,1715200,again now in a situation where people  are acting selfishly the smart approach  is forcing them to think that the only
MB5sOpij7aU,1715200,1721120,way to benefit is to cooperate there was  a great example of this on a show called  golden balls which used the game theory
MB5sOpij7aU,1721120,1726640,problem of the prisoner's dilemma as the  premise two players must decide to  either steal all the prize money or
MB5sOpij7aU,1726640,1732240,split it between them but if they both  decide to steal they each get nothing  now what's so fascinating is that this
MB5sOpij7aU,1732240,1737840,man here single-handedly broke the  entire game his strategy was to tell his  opponent that he was going to steal but
MB5sOpij7aU,1737840,1744559,prowess to share the money after the  show it sounds crazy because if he  really wanted to share it that he could  have chosen split but the genius here is
MB5sOpij7aU,1744559,1750320,that it gave the other player no option  to steal it for himself with no better  choice he decided to split and later
MB5sOpij7aU,1750320,1755679,found out his opponent also picked slit  the producers recognized that this  strategy would break the game and cancel
MB5sOpij7aU,1755679,1761039,the show that same season this is a  great example of why sometimes the best  strategy is to convince your opponent
MB5sOpij7aU,1761039,1766320,that his only choice is to cooperate and  if they believe you that you might both  get what you want in the end desperate
MB5sOpij7aU,1766320,1771760,to remain in the game the man begs them  to turn this vote into a draw and the  woman agrees but insists she'll put
MB5sOpij7aU,1771760,1777200,everyone's ballots into the box for them  it's the easiest way to ensure no one  can cheat and she puts all their cards
MB5sOpij7aU,1777200,1782640,in but this was their biggest mistake  the nerd confronts akiyama confident  that he's going to lose but that's when
MB5sOpij7aU,1782640,1787919,he stands up and reveals they've just  been tricked the agent begins to  announce the final results but suddenly
MB5sOpij7aU,1787919,1794559,she tells them that the woman voted yes  turning them into the majority the men  don't understand what happened and  akiyama explains that he's working with
MB5sOpij7aU,1794559,1800640,the woman she reveals that she never  wanted to move on to the next game and  secretly made plans of the con man so  they could wipe out the remaining
MB5sOpij7aU,1800640,1805679,opponents by baiting the nerd into  asking for a draw the only thing akiya  had to do to convince the woman was let
MB5sOpij7aU,1805679,1810960,her hold on to his nameplate as  insurance and that means the nerd has  lost suddenly the dealer announces the
MB5sOpij7aU,1810960,1816480,second round is over and the winner can  claim his prize taking him to another  room the agent gives akiyama the reward
MB5sOpij7aU,1816480,1822880,of 2.1 billion yen and tells him that he  can either continue playing the game or  give back half his money to quit after
MB5sOpij7aU,1822880,1828320,making his decision he heads back home  with now and she asks how much money he  gave to the woman with the sunglasses he
MB5sOpij7aU,1828320,1834320,reveals that she received 1.2 billion  yen and the rest of his prize money will  be used to pay off everyone's debts the
MB5sOpij7aU,1834320,1840880,girl doesn't understand how he has that  much cash but the man reveals that he's  going to enter the third round  continuing the game until he can finally
MB5sOpij7aU,1840880,1846480,confront the masterminds the next  morning the girl tries to call akiyama  worried that he's taking on too much to
MB5sOpij7aU,1846480,1852640,handle but he refuses to answer suddenly  she hears a knock on her door and when  she opens it finds the fake cop waiting
MB5sOpij7aU,1852640,1859360,for her on the other side she  immediately shuts it yelling at him to  leave her alone but he reveals that  there's a way she can help the con man
MB5sOpij7aU,1859360,1864480,feeling guilty the girl lets him inside  and he tells her that three days from  now there will be a private game for the
MB5sOpij7aU,1864480,1870480,losers of the second round if she wins  now has a chance to win enough money to  pay for akiyama's quitting fee but the
MB5sOpij7aU,1870480,1876000,girl is terrified she won't have any  help this time and the man makes it  clear that this is the only opportunity
MB5sOpij7aU,1876000,1881679,the hc will give to save her friend  three days later she goes to the  location of this revival round where the
MB5sOpij7aU,1881679,1886880,agent welcomes her back to the  tournament walking inside the arcade the  girl reunites with several losers from
MB5sOpij7aU,1886880,1892880,the last game but that's when she  realizes that the thief okunaga is also  here and he's bitter about losing
MB5sOpij7aU,1892880,1898480,suddenly the tv screen turns on and the  dealer welcomes them to their next  challenge their goal is to steal 100
MB5sOpij7aU,1898480,1904159,million yen and those who win will be  forced to play in the next round but  this makes them all furious they came
MB5sOpij7aU,1904159,1910720,here hoping to pay off their debts and  the dealer makes it clear that the  winners will not only be able to pay off  what they owe but also win a huge sum of
MB5sOpij7aU,1910720,1916720,cash none of them can afford to turn on  the offer and the players decide to stay  knowing this is their only real option
MB5sOpij7aU,1916720,1921919,with that the doors are locked from the  inside and the dealer explains that  first they must choose one person to
MB5sOpij7aU,1921919,1927360,kick out of the tournament so that the  winner of this revival round can take  their place now here is terrified of
MB5sOpij7aU,1927360,1932640,what's about to happen and soon she'll  have to go through four more rounds to  finally escape the liar game tournament

MB5sOpij7aU,5120,11519,spend the rest of your life in crippling  debt what would you do i'm going to  break down the mistakes made what you
MB5sOpij7aU,11519,18800,should do and how to beat the dead games  in liar game this girl is going to  gamble her life away now here returns
MB5sOpij7aU,18800,24320,home to find a mysterious package  outside her room with a black envelope  curious she opens the package to
MB5sOpij7aU,24320,30400,discover bundles of money stacked inside  the girl can't believe what she's seeing  and reads the letter finding out she's
MB5sOpij7aU,30400,37760,been entered into the liar game  tournament and will soon be forced to  play the dirtiest tricks she can think  of in order to win examining the box the
MB5sOpij7aU,37760,43840,girl discovers there's exactly 100  million yen inside and decides to check  what's on the vhs tape putting it in the
MB5sOpij7aU,43840,49600,vcr it plays a video where a puppet  introduces itself as the dealer and  reveals that because she's watching this
MB5sOpij7aU,49600,56000,video now has agreed to participate in  the liar game with no way to back out  the dealer explains that for the first
MB5sOpij7aU,56000,61520,round of the tournament the players must  steal their opponent's money by any  means necessary and whoever has the most
MB5sOpij7aU,61520,66960,cash after 30 days will be the winner at  the end of the round an agent will be  sent to collect the money and the winner
MB5sOpij7aU,66960,72000,will be allowed to keep whatever they  stole while the loser will be forced to  pay back the full amount the girl is
MB5sOpij7aU,72000,77040,overwhelmed and goes to the police  station to make a report but the officer  tells her that since the cash has been
MB5sOpij7aU,77040,83280,sent to her by name it wasn't stolen  that means the police can't help the  girl and now here has to protect it on
MB5sOpij7aU,83280,88880,her own returning home she struggles to  figure out what to do when she suddenly  hears something fall through her mail
MB5sOpij7aU,88880,94640,slot entering the other room she opens  her mailbox to find an envelope labeled  opponent and inside is a letter
MB5sOpij7aU,94640,100000,revealing that she's competing against  her old middle school teacher but soon  she'll realize he's a lot more dangerous
MB5sOpij7aU,100000,105759,than he appears later that day now  decides to visit the man to talk about  the tournament but he tells her the game
MB5sOpij7aU,105759,111600,is actually a scam he thinks the  organizers will secretly steal the money  given to the players and force them into
MB5sOpij7aU,111600,116960,debt it makes perfect sense to her and  he suggests they keep both of their  money in a safety deposit box so the
MB5sOpij7aU,116960,123200,organizers can't take it back the girls  relieved he can help and hands over her  bag of cash but this was her biggest
MB5sOpij7aU,123200,128560,mistake now what's terrifying is that  this is only the first of many games  she'll be trapped into play and if she
MB5sOpij7aU,128560,134959,doesn't learn how to think for herself  then it's only going to get worse  okay this girl is a complete idiot she
MB5sOpij7aU,134959,141360,should have known that handing over the  money was a terrible idea but the worst  part about this is that everything her  teacher said was something she could
MB5sOpij7aU,141360,146480,have easily done herself without his  help now to give her some credit it  should first go without saying that in a
MB5sOpij7aU,146480,152000,game like this it's smart to not trust  any information you've been given for  all we know the teacher might actually
MB5sOpij7aU,152000,158560,be right and this could be some kind of  scam because if someone is willing to  give out a combined total of 1.5 million
MB5sOpij7aU,158560,164319,us dollars to two strangers it's  reasonable to assume that there must be  a catch and that the person most likely
MB5sOpij7aU,164319,169920,to benefit from this is not you nobody  spends that kind of money without  getting something for it in return and
MB5sOpij7aU,169920,175519,it's extremely likely that it will be at  your expense the problem is that this is  not the only way to think about this
MB5sOpij7aU,175519,181680,scenario because if the game is real and  the rules are true then she's obviously  going to lose by handing him the money
MB5sOpij7aU,181680,187040,if it were me i would have called his  bluff and accepted his offer to help but  would then insist that we go to the bank
MB5sOpij7aU,187040,192159,together to make sure the money was  deposited this would then force the  teacher to admit he was lying because
MB5sOpij7aU,192159,199040,the man should already know if you take  1.5 million dollars and ask to secure it  in a deposit box there's a very low
MB5sOpij7aU,199040,204560,chance the bank would even let you do it  most banks put limitations on the value  of the items because they're actually a
MB5sOpij7aU,204560,210480,lot less safe and they don't want to be  held liable if it's stolen even worse  storing that much money in cash makes it
MB5sOpij7aU,210480,215680,look like you're trying to hide it from  the irs if it looks like we acquired  this money illegally then they're a lot
MB5sOpij7aU,215680,222239,more likely to deny our application and  without any paperwork to prove it's ours  this is not a viable option now if this
MB5sOpij7aU,222239,227360,girl doesn't know who to trust it would  have been much smarter to take the  teacher's advice but keep her money
MB5sOpij7aU,227360,232799,locked up ensuring that she won't lose  the game normal should be tempted into  spending the money and falling for some
MB5sOpij7aU,232799,238159,kind of scam instead of thinking this  through she decided to hinge everything  on the belief that her middle school
MB5sOpij7aU,238159,243599,teacher was a good person now as stupid  as this might seem you'd be surprised  how often we make the same mistakes in
MB5sOpij7aU,243599,249120,our daily lives and it's actually known  as heuristic thinking when we encounter  a very complex choice with a lot of
MB5sOpij7aU,249120,254400,different factors the human mind has a  way of shortcutting our problem-solving  by generalizing it until you reach
MB5sOpij7aU,254400,260320,what's called a cognitive bias and that  means you're statistically more likely  to draw inaccurate conclusions even
MB5sOpij7aU,260320,265440,though you've used a logical framework  to get there for example this girl has  known this man personally for three
MB5sOpij7aU,265440,271280,years has had no negative experiences  with him in the past and he's offering  to help this makes it easier for her to
MB5sOpij7aU,271280,276639,trust him than to trust the game and  it's exactly the kind of cognitive bias  that contributes to making the worst
MB5sOpij7aU,276639,282479,choice possible that night the girl  arrives home and discovers that the  organizers have sent another letter this
MB5sOpij7aU,282479,288479,time it warns her that she's now 100  million yen in debt and is losing the  game worried she calls her teacher to
MB5sOpij7aU,288479,295199,ask what happened with the money and the  man explains that the letter is a trick  meant to make them suspicious of each  other believing him now decides to
MB5sOpij7aU,295199,300720,apologize for doubting her teacher and  visits the man the next day but as she  approaches him the girl overhears
MB5sOpij7aU,300720,306080,something that breaks her heart on the  phone he brags to his friend that he  tricked her into giving him money and
MB5sOpij7aU,306080,311759,she was stupid enough to trust him the  next morning she tries to report the  theft to the police officer but the man
MB5sOpij7aU,311759,317280,explained she can't prove her money was  stolen because she gave it away  willingly instead he suggests she get
MB5sOpij7aU,317280,322800,advice from a con artist who's just  finished his sentence and with no better  option she decides to look for him
MB5sOpij7aU,322800,327840,arriving at the prison where the man is  being released the girl is suddenly  knocked to the ground and when she looks
MB5sOpij7aU,327840,334400,up she sees it's the con artist the girl  begs akiyama here for help but the man  isn't interested and quickly walks away
MB5sOpij7aU,334400,341039,she chases after him refusing to take no  for an answer so he promises to hear her  out she tells him about the liar's game
MB5sOpij7aU,341039,346800,explaining that the money was stolen and  the con man quickly comes up with a plan  they visit her teacher asking him to
MB5sOpij7aU,346800,352639,give all the money back but the old man  insists that it's not going to happen  the safety deposit box he used can't be
MB5sOpij7aU,352639,358800,accessed after 5 pm on weekdays but  that's when now calls him out revealing  she heard him brag about stealing the
MB5sOpij7aU,358800,364240,money the con man threatens to call the  police unless he gives it back but the  teacher argues that he didn't commit a
MB5sOpij7aU,364240,370400,crime according to the tournament rules  with his lie exposed the man and mislead  tricked the girl but tells them he needs
MB5sOpij7aU,370400,376800,the money more than she does and will do  whatever it takes to win that night now  is ready to give up but this time the
MB5sOpij7aU,376800,383280,con man has a different plan the teacher  mentioned that the safety deposit box  can't be accessed after 5 pm on weekdays
MB5sOpij7aU,383280,388639,and the girl realizes the last day of  the game is on a sunday this means the  teacher will have to withdraw the money
MB5sOpij7aU,388639,395120,on friday and that's when they'll take  it from him but akiyama only offers to  help if she pays him 50 million yen that
MB5sOpij7aU,395120,400800,means he'll have to steal the teacher's  money to pay for his service and with no  other option the girl agrees the next
MB5sOpij7aU,400800,406000,morning now visits her teacher and  threatens that she's going to take all  his cash before running off it's a part
MB5sOpij7aU,406000,411520,of their plan to make him paranoid about  what they might do and trick him into  making a mistake over the passing days
MB5sOpij7aU,411520,417440,the two of them spy on the teacher and  constantly watch every move he makes  with only seven days left the girl is
MB5sOpij7aU,417440,423039,nervous that they've been wasting time  but akiyama explains they're waiting for  the perfect moment to strike the old man
MB5sOpij7aU,423039,428080,will get more paranoid the longer he  waits for them to make a move and his  behavior has already revealed something
MB5sOpij7aU,428080,435599,important he hasn't left his house in  weeks and the only possible reason is  that he's protecting the money he's  hidden there okay this girl has not
MB5sOpij7aU,435599,442560,learned her lesson she already made the  mistake of trusting her middle school  teacher but she should have realized  that a con man would be even more likely
MB5sOpij7aU,442560,448479,to take advantage of her this guy just  got out of jail and probably doesn't  have a single yen to his name according
MB5sOpij7aU,448479,453599,to the game the money technically  doesn't belong to either of the players  so it would be easy for him to steal all
MB5sOpij7aU,453599,459120,the cash and disappear without a trace  it should go without saying that the  more people you involve the more you'll
MB5sOpij7aU,459120,464879,have to worry about getting betrayed  which makes asking for help a very risky  strategy unfortunately it's clear the
MB5sOpij7aU,464879,470080,girl won't be able to win this game  alone so it was the only choice she had  now what's interesting is that this
MB5sOpij7aU,470080,476400,scenario is very similar to a problem in  game theory called the trust gate as you  can see from this diagram there's a lot
MB5sOpij7aU,476400,482800,happening underneath but on the surface  it's really simple in 1995 economists  set up an experiment to find out how
MB5sOpij7aU,482800,488319,much trust would influence economic  decision making and paired two strangers  together both were given some money and
MB5sOpij7aU,488319,494240,the first player is told to choose how  much to give away whatever he decides  that sum will be tripled and given to
MB5sOpij7aU,494240,499759,the second player then the second player  is told to choose how much money he  wants to return the researchers
MB5sOpij7aU,499759,505360,predicted that both players would choose  to act selfishly and give nothing to  their opponent but they were completely
MB5sOpij7aU,505360,511520,wrong what they found was that 94 of the  first players would give away over half  of their money tripling the amount for
MB5sOpij7aU,511520,516880,the second player so there was more for  them to give back that means if they  both started with ten dollars then by
MB5sOpij7aU,516880,523279,playing cooperatively they could end the  game with 15 each or play selfishly and  end up with less now the difference here
MB5sOpij7aU,523279,528880,is that in this game there can only be  one winner but that doesn't mean there  have to be any losers if the girl and
MB5sOpij7aU,528880,534959,the teacher had discussed whether or not  it was worth it to risk spending the  rest of their life in crippling debt  they both might have come to the
MB5sOpij7aU,534959,540880,conclusion that they have more to gain  if they cooperate and trust each other  to return their own cash after 30 days
MB5sOpij7aU,540880,546080,neither of them would win but it's the  only outcome where they both don't lose  now the teacher made a huge mistake
MB5sOpij7aU,546080,551519,taking all the money because he left his  opponent with no other strategy than to  steal and entrapped him into only being
MB5sOpij7aU,551519,557600,able to protect the money without any  other strategic options in game theory  this is known as the nash equilibrium
MB5sOpij7aU,557600,564399,where knowing what the other player will  do doesn't change the strategy or the  outcome you might recognize this name  from the movie a beautiful mind which is
MB5sOpij7aU,564399,569839,about the man who the theory is named  after now if i were the teacher i would  have realized it's a lot smarter to have
MB5sOpij7aU,569839,575440,stolen half of her money and then  threatened to steal the other half it  might sound counterintuitive but this
MB5sOpij7aU,575440,580959,would actually force the girl to choose  whether or not to protect what she  already has or risk it being stolen to
MB5sOpij7aU,580959,586000,try getting the rest of it back this is  the best decision the teacher could make  because if he leaves her with this
MB5sOpij7aU,586000,591839,choice she won't be spending all of her  time trying to steal from him making his  money safer from being stolen the next
MB5sOpij7aU,591839,597519,morning the teacher wakes up to find  smoke filling the room panicking he's  about to run outside but stays behind to
MB5sOpij7aU,597519,604240,let the smoke out instead he pulls out  his phone to call the fire department  when he suddenly hears a noise behind  him and turns around to see his opponent
MB5sOpij7aU,604240,609440,standing outside akiyama reveals they  tricked him to thinking there was a fire  so they could figure out where the money
MB5sOpij7aU,609440,614640,was hidden and the teacher admits that  it's in the house but they'll never be  able to take it all the cash has been
MB5sOpij7aU,614640,620160,locked inside a heavy duty safe but the  con man makes it clear that this won't  stop them from winning the game they
MB5sOpij7aU,620160,626000,leave the house as the man panics that  he's going to lose all the money but  akiyama has one last trick up his sleeve
MB5sOpij7aU,626000,631120,the next night the teacher checks his  mail and discovers a letter from the  game designers it warns him that
MB5sOpij7aU,631120,637200,tomorrow at 5 pm an agent will be sent  to collect the money and announce the  end of the first game the next morning
MB5sOpij7aU,637200,642720,the teacher keeps watch over his house  and protects the safe until there's only  10 minutes left before the round ends
MB5sOpij7aU,642720,649360,desperate now here begs the con man to  do something or else they'll lose but he  stays quiet it seems he's given up and
MB5sOpij7aU,649360,654959,the girl leaves the room disappointed  that she ever trusted him arriving at  the teacher's house she begs him to give
MB5sOpij7aU,654959,661279,back her money but he refuses and pushes  her to the ground there's nothing she  can do as the clock hits 5 pm and the
MB5sOpij7aU,661279,667040,man realizes he's won the agent has  already arrived in the house and the  teacher invites him inside to show him
MB5sOpij7aU,667040,673279,the cash unlocking the safe the man lets  him count the 200 million yen and  celebrates his victory but this was his
MB5sOpij7aU,673279,679120,biggest mistake one hour later the agent  is almost done checking the cash when  they hear the doorbell suddenly ring
MB5sOpij7aU,679120,684399,confused the teacher walks to the front  door finding more agents have come to  collect the money and that's when the
MB5sOpij7aU,684399,690240,other man walks past them to leave he  realizes something's wrong and runs back  to his living room to find the con man
MB5sOpij7aU,690240,696399,waiting for him akiyama reveals that the  first agent was an imposter he hired and  he replaced his letter with a fake one
MB5sOpij7aU,696399,702480,the real agents were supposed to come  here at 6pm and that means the teacher  has just lost the game with the round
MB5sOpij7aU,702480,708800,officially over now here is deemed the  winner and gets to keep 100 million yen  as a reward the girl heads back home
MB5sOpij7aU,708800,713839,with her new friend but she realizes  that her teacher won't be able to pay  back his own debt and will ruin him for
MB5sOpij7aU,713839,719440,life feeling guilty she returns to his  house and offers him half of the money  she wants so he can pay back some of his
MB5sOpij7aU,719440,724959,debt but that was her biggest mistake  okay this girl is way too nice her own
MB5sOpij7aU,724959,730160,middle school teacher was a moments away  from putting her in crippling debt and  now she's giving him half of her
MB5sOpij7aU,730160,736160,winnings she also has to pay the con man  the other half for his help and it  leaves her with nothing left now luckily
MB5sOpij7aU,736160,743200,they managed to win the game but the  problem with their strategy is that if  one thing went wrong their opponent  would have easily won if anything raised
MB5sOpij7aU,743200,748639,to suspicions they would only have one  hour to come up with a new plan and  that's not something i'd be willing to
MB5sOpij7aU,748639,754160,risk we need as much time on our site as  possible and that's why i would have  tried to steal his money a lot sooner
MB5sOpij7aU,754160,760000,one of the most important details is  that the rules explicitly state any  action taken to steal the money won't be
MB5sOpij7aU,760000,766079,treated as a crime now this is a very  strange rule because if it's true it  implies that law enforcement is not only
MB5sOpij7aU,766079,772240,aware of the game but also controlled by  the liar game agency earlier the girl  went to this policeman after her money
MB5sOpij7aU,772240,779040,was stolen but she didn't stop to  realize how strange it was that the  local law enforcement was recommending  she find a criminal to help her there's
MB5sOpij7aU,779040,784720,no way that would happen unless he was  already working for the game and if this  is true then we have a lot more options
MB5sOpij7aU,784720,790320,that should be explored because it means  we could break it to his house tie him  down or even kill him without getting in
MB5sOpij7aU,790320,795839,trouble for it now there's no reason to  take it that far but understanding our  options is essential for making sure we
MB5sOpij7aU,795839,801360,have a plan that gives us the best  chance of success and waiting until one  hour before the game ends is not the
MB5sOpij7aU,801360,807279,best strategy here if it were me i would  wait until he's asleep break into his  house with a weapon and lie that we will
MB5sOpij7aU,807279,812639,kill him if he doesn't open the safe  this forces him to choose between his  life or the money and that's something
MB5sOpij7aU,812639,818720,he won't much to risk trying to color  bluff the game has given us the freedom  to use brute force as a solution with no
MB5sOpij7aU,818720,825040,consequences and not trying this first  to be a terrible waste of an opportunity  that night now here is walking home when
MB5sOpij7aU,825040,830480,she sees akiyama waiting for her and he  hands over his half of the winnings he's  had a change of heart and the girl
MB5sOpij7aU,830480,835760,leaves to take the briefcase to the  teacher relieved that the man will be  able to pay back his debt in full later
MB5sOpij7aU,835760,841199,she takes akiyama back to her place but  as the girl checks her mail she  discovers something horrifying it's
MB5sOpij7aU,841199,847839,another letter from the organizers  announcing that she's qualified for the  second round of the liar game but  there's a catch they sit down to watch
MB5sOpij7aU,847839,853519,the video that was sent and the dealer  tells her that she has two choices now  can either keep playing or pay back half
MB5sOpij7aU,853519,861360,her winnings and drop out of the  tournament but if she doesn't choose in  time the agency will force her to return  the entire 100 million yen by any means
MB5sOpij7aU,861360,867360,necessary she's already given away all  her money and they both realize they  have no choice but to continue playing
MB5sOpij7aU,867360,874079,the next morning the girl goes to the  mansion where the next game will be held  and the agent instructs her to wear this  name plate before opening the doors
MB5sOpij7aU,874079,879839,revealing a room full of other  contestants suddenly a tv screen turns  on and the dealer welcomes them to the
MB5sOpij7aU,879839,885839,second round but that's when the con man  walks in announcing he's joined the  tournament the girl is shocked and the
MB5sOpij7aU,885839,891279,man explains he came to stop her from  playing but now he's stuck here just  like the rest of them he's about to tell
MB5sOpij7aU,891279,897120,her what happened but suddenly the doors  close and the dealer begins to explain  the rules everyone has tiny gems
MB5sOpij7aU,897120,903519,attached to their nameplates that are  each worth 100 million yen and must  compete for the grand price of 2.1
MB5sOpij7aU,903519,909839,billion yen in this game one player will  be chosen to ask a yes or no question  and the others will have six hours to
MB5sOpij7aU,909839,914959,vote on an answer everyone who chose the  answer with the least amount of votes  will be allowed to stay while the losers
MB5sOpij7aU,914959,920880,must drop out of the tournament and go  100 million yen in debt this will  continue until there are no more than
MB5sOpij7aU,920880,926720,two players remaining and if the winners  refuse to play in the next round half of  their money will be taken with the rules
MB5sOpij7aU,926720,933279,explained the dealer tells the players  that they will host a practice round  before the real challenge starts  tomorrow almost everyone is nervous
MB5sOpij7aU,933279,938720,about their chances and now approaches  the con man curious to know how he  became a player akiyama explains that he
MB5sOpij7aU,938720,945440,came to stop her from joining the second  round but when he arrived he met a  player who was robbed by another  participant the agent offered him a
MB5sOpij7aU,945440,950639,chance to take someone's place but now  he's gambling with his life just like  the others later the players are
MB5sOpij7aU,950639,955839,gathering the rehearsal room and one of  them is chosen to create a question  walking up to the front she asks the
MB5sOpij7aU,955839,961440,players are you a woman and they're  given these cards with either yes or no  on them they must use these to vote but
MB5sOpij7aU,961440,967600,the dealer warns if both cards are put  into the box or they fail to vote on  time they'll be disqualified for the
MB5sOpij7aU,967600,973199,practice round they'll be given 10  minutes and the timer begins counting  down looking around now realizes that
MB5sOpij7aU,973199,978639,there are more male players than female  so she should be in the minority but  with time running out everyone places
MB5sOpij7aU,978639,984240,their votes in the ballot box  okay this game is a lot more intense  instead of trying to predict the actions
MB5sOpij7aU,984240,989440,of one player we now have 21 other  people we have to take into  consideration and every single one of
MB5sOpij7aU,989440,994959,them is willing to screw us over to win  the game this is not going to be easy to  find a good strategy for but luckily
MB5sOpij7aU,994959,1000639,this scenario is actually a real problem  that's studied in game theory and it's  known as the el feral bar problem the
MB5sOpij7aU,1000639,1007040,idea is that every night there are a  hundred people who want to visit the el  faro bar but it can only hold 60. if any
MB5sOpij7aU,1007040,1012560,more than that shows up it will be too  crowded but everyone must decide at the  same time whether to go or not with no
MB5sOpij7aU,1012560,1017920,knowledge of the other people's choices  this is very similar to the situation  these players are facing because they
MB5sOpij7aU,1017920,1024480,all want to be in the minority but the  good news is that we can talk to our  opponents to collect data and it might  help us to manipulate them to vote one
MB5sOpij7aU,1024480,1030240,way instead of another now surprisingly  there's actually a mathematical solution  to the el faro bar problem but it only
MB5sOpij7aU,1030240,1035438,works with more data from previous  experiments and since this is just the  first test round we need to figure out
MB5sOpij7aU,1035438,1041678,how people will vote without this  equation for the time being we already  know there are more men than there are  women and that means if everyone votes
MB5sOpij7aU,1041678,1047199,according to their gender the women will  automatically win as the minority as  soon as the men figure this out it's
MB5sOpij7aU,1047199,1052559,guaranteed that some of them will vote  the other way and all it takes is three  men to lie for the minority to switch
MB5sOpij7aU,1052559,1059039,there might be some women who figure  this out as well and change their votes  but it's more likely that there will be  a lot more from the current majority to
MB5sOpij7aU,1059039,1064559,switch votes than the other way around  with all that in mind the obvious  solution for now here is to vote no and
MB5sOpij7aU,1064559,1069919,see what happens and even though we  can't use a strategy for every round  it's going to give us the best chance at
MB5sOpij7aU,1069919,1076960,passing this test the results are  counted revealing that 15 people voted  yes and only 7 answered no shocked the
MB5sOpij7aU,1076960,1082160,girl doesn't understand how that's  possible since there are only nine women  but the dealer explains that the truth
MB5sOpij7aU,1082160,1087600,doesn't matter in this game the goal is  to be part of the group with the least  votes and they need to trick the others
MB5sOpij7aU,1087600,1093039,to vote for the majority afterwards an  agent tells the players they'll be  disqualified if they leave and with no
MB5sOpij7aU,1093039,1098880,better option they all decide to stay  upstairs akiyama here comes up with a  clever plan explaining to the girl that
MB5sOpij7aU,1098880,1104320,they'll need to form an eight-man team  if they all join forces to split their  votes evenly between yes and no then
MB5sOpij7aU,1104320,1110799,they can ensure at least one of the  members will win the grand prize then  the winner can drop out of the  tournament paying the quitter's fee and
MB5sOpij7aU,1110799,1115919,whatever is left will be shared with the  others that way they'll each get at  least 40 million yen but there's a
MB5sOpij7aU,1115919,1121440,problem the player that akiyama replaced  had all of her money stolen and that  thief is someone in this tournament but
MB5sOpij7aU,1121440,1127120,the only thing they know is that it's a  woman if she joined the team she could  easily betray them but that's when now
MB5sOpij7aU,1127120,1132559,has an idea the girl realizes if they  don't have any other women in the group  the thief can't take advantage of their
MB5sOpij7aU,1132559,1138400,strategy and leaves the room to look for  allies she comes back with six other men  and with the group assembled akiyama has
MB5sOpij7aU,1138400,1143600,them sign a contract promising that the  winner will split the money but one of  the men asks who the mysterious thief
MB5sOpij7aU,1143600,1149360,might be now admits that they think it's  the woman in the sunglasses and the nerd  agrees he figures that since she must
MB5sOpij7aU,1149360,1155039,have stolen the check the woman isn't  scared of losing and going into debt it  makes perfect sense and the group is
MB5sOpij7aU,1155039,1160799,confident they'll win with no idea that  there's already a traitor among them the  next morning the players gather for the
MB5sOpij7aU,1160799,1166400,first round of the game and the geek is  instructed to come to the stage standing  at the front he asks if beaches are
MB5sOpij7aU,1166400,1172480,better than mountains the team members  spend the next six hours gathering  information on their opponents and they  all cast their votes in the final
MB5sOpij7aU,1172480,1178559,seconds of the game the results are  counted and the first round ends with 10  yeses versus 12 knows everything is
MB5sOpij7aU,1178559,1184320,going to plan so far but the woman with  the sunglasses survived the round and it  only makes her more suspicious
MB5sOpij7aU,1184320,1191120,okay this was brutal 12 players just got  kicked out of the game but the good news  is that so far akiyama's strategy seems
MB5sOpij7aU,1191120,1197120,to be working he split his team in two  with four of them voting yes and four of  them voting no this guarantees that at
MB5sOpij7aU,1197120,1202720,least one member of the group will stay  into the last round and is contractually  obligated to share the reward money the
MB5sOpij7aU,1202720,1208000,biggest problem here is that cooperation  also makes it more vulnerable for others  to take advantage but akiyama didn't
MB5sOpij7aU,1208000,1213360,realize that there was an even better  way to guarantee winning the game we  have to encourage cooperation as much as
MB5sOpij7aU,1213360,1219200,possible and that's why if it were me  instead of gathering the men i would do  the exact opposite and gather the women
MB5sOpij7aU,1219200,1224240,to form our team based on what we  currently know we can assume that the  thief is likely to be in the group and
MB5sOpij7aU,1224240,1229840,that's exactly what we want including  the thief will help us identify her more  quickly and ancient wisdom tells us to
MB5sOpij7aU,1229840,1235440,keep your friends close and your enemies  closer this will allow you to monitor  their activity and plan against it
MB5sOpij7aU,1235440,1242240,anything that limits your opponent's  options is often the best strategy and  when there's already a good incentive to  cooperate it's very possible that they
MB5sOpij7aU,1242240,1248480,will agree to the terms instead of  working against us with 10 players still  remaining the con man realizes his idea
MB5sOpij7aU,1248480,1253840,might go wrong but insists they stick  with the strategy that's when this guy  is chosen to present the next question
MB5sOpij7aU,1253840,1259280,and walks to the stage asking the group  whether or not they're all sadists  feeling something's wrong the con man
MB5sOpij7aU,1259280,1265760,tells now to vote no in this round while  he votes yes and the girl is confused  but follows his advice overhearing them
MB5sOpij7aU,1265760,1271520,the nerd confronts him wanting to know  why akiyama suddenly switched votes and  he tells the man not to worry about it
MB5sOpij7aU,1271520,1276559,with that cleared up the players make  their choices and when the ballots are  counted the results show that six people
MB5sOpij7aU,1276559,1282080,have voted no now here has just lost the  round and leaves the tournament hopeful  that her team will win but when she
MB5sOpij7aU,1282080,1287280,looks back the girl sees something  shocking the woman with the sunglasses  is still in the game and if she's the
MB5sOpij7aU,1287280,1293120,thief she might ruin akiyama's plan the  next morning the remaining four players  begin the third round of the game and
MB5sOpij7aU,1293120,1298320,the nerd is called to present a question  standing in front of the group he asks  them if he will win and the timer starts
MB5sOpij7aU,1298320,1303600,counting down afterwards he approaches  akiyama and double checks with him so he  knows how they're supposed to vote if
MB5sOpij7aU,1303600,1309200,all goes according to plan this round  will finally end but soon everyone will  know who the thief is later the
MB5sOpij7aU,1309200,1314880,participants are casting their votes and  the nerd notices the con man is folding  his card into a small square curious he
MB5sOpij7aU,1314880,1320400,asks him why and the guy tells him this  will guarantee it's picked last he puts  his voting card into the ballot box and
MB5sOpij7aU,1320400,1326400,the agent begins to announce the results  revealing that at least two people have  both chosen to answer no that means only
MB5sOpij7aU,1326400,1332480,one team member needs to choose yes for  them to win and suddenly now here bursts  into the room she came back to check how
MB5sOpij7aU,1332480,1337760,the game went along with the other  losers and they're told to watch from  the sidelines noticing how happy she is
MB5sOpij7aU,1337760,1342799,this woman asks why the girl is so  excited and the nerd interrupts  revealing they formed a team together
MB5sOpij7aU,1342799,1348080,but then he calls her an idiot he was  only pretending to work with them and  was actually the thief the whole time
MB5sOpij7aU,1348080,1353679,showing everyone the check he stole from  another player to make matters worse his  signature on the contract was faked
MB5sOpij7aU,1353679,1358799,meaning he doesn't have to share any of  the prize money with them the girl  doesn't understand why he's so confident
MB5sOpij7aU,1358799,1364640,he'd win but the nerd decides to explain  his master plan he copied akiyama's  strategy and formed two other teams of
MB5sOpij7aU,1364640,1370480,his own ensuring that he would always be  in the minority because he was a member  of all three teams but only casting one
MB5sOpij7aU,1370480,1375919,vote which tipped the scales by knowing  exactly what the others would choose and  being the tiebreaker he could pass each
MB5sOpij7aU,1375919,1382720,vote safely without anyone else knowing  okay this guy is a genius after joining  akiyama's team he realized that there
MB5sOpij7aU,1382720,1388240,were exactly enough players to make the  strategy work for his own self-interest  and managed to trick everyone else that
MB5sOpij7aU,1388240,1393440,he was on their side too but there's one  possible strategy that could have  completely undermined his ability to
MB5sOpij7aU,1393440,1399760,pull this off earlier all the players  were given these nameplates which  represent the money they're each  gambling with the agent even warned the
MB5sOpij7aU,1399760,1405280,girl she needs to keep it with her at  all times and that means if it goes  missing she might not be able to gamble
MB5sOpij7aU,1405280,1410559,or continue playing now they've already  spent a single night here and it's  reasonable to assume the nameplates will
MB5sOpij7aU,1410559,1416000,likely be taken off before they go to  sleep this creates a very interesting  opportunity because if someone forgets
MB5sOpij7aU,1416000,1421679,to lock their door at night we could  easily walk inside their rooms and steal  100 million yen without anyone knowing
MB5sOpij7aU,1421679,1428240,if this strategy was recognized by any  of these players and somebody cast a  vote without their nameplate the next  morning that person's vote might be
MB5sOpij7aU,1428240,1433600,disqualified and something like this  could easily tip the skills from a  majority to a minority we don't know if
MB5sOpij7aU,1433600,1439600,the strategy is against the rules but  there's good reason to think it should  be possible it's already been  established in the previous game that
MB5sOpij7aU,1439600,1446159,taking someone's money was not only  allowed but encouraged and they even let  the thief participate in the second  round after he stole the woman's check
MB5sOpij7aU,1446159,1451360,so it's reasonable to assume that it's  fair for us to keep stealing during the  game now if we were paying attention
MB5sOpij7aU,1451360,1456960,there were plenty of signs that told us  this guy was a lot more suspicious than  he looks during their first meeting now
MB5sOpij7aU,1456960,1462720,here admitted that there was a thief in  the game but the nerd immediately  pointed out why the girl in the  sunglasses was the most suspicious
MB5sOpij7aU,1462720,1468000,player and suggested they should all  look for reasons to prove she's the  thief he also kept asking akiyama who
MB5sOpij7aU,1468000,1473279,he's voting for even though his  instructions were already given this is  suspicious behavior and the more nosy
MB5sOpij7aU,1473279,1478400,someone is the more likely they want to  use that information for their own  agenda if i were akiyama i would have
MB5sOpij7aU,1478400,1483600,started considering him a risk based on  his behavior and try to take precautions  in case something unexpected happened
MB5sOpij7aU,1483600,1489760,when we look at the situation from this  perspective there were plenty of signs  that would have given us enough reason  to single the nerd out and decide to
MB5sOpij7aU,1489760,1495200,steal his nameplate as insurance in case  he betrays us if our suspicions were  wrong then we could simply return the
MB5sOpij7aU,1495200,1500480,nameplate during his vote and continue  the game suddenly the agent announced  that the nerd has voted yes and he's
MB5sOpij7aU,1500480,1506159,moments away from winning the game but  to everyone's surprise that's when it's  revealed that akiyama voted yes as well
MB5sOpij7aU,1506159,1511520,that means the votes are tied and there  will have to be another round but the  nerd is furious demanding to know how
MB5sOpij7aU,1511520,1517200,his plan went wrong amused the con man  explains he figured someone else must  have copied his idea after almost
MB5sOpij7aU,1517200,1522400,everyone lost in the first vote but  nobody looked upset the only reason  they'd be calm was if they had a
MB5sOpij7aU,1522400,1528320,strategy that guaranteed they would win  but akiyama was smart enough to realize  the nerd was the thief a long time ago
MB5sOpij7aU,1528320,1533840,the first question was why the mystery  thief was disguised themselves but the  con man realized that it would only make
MB5sOpij7aU,1533840,1539679,sense if they were playing as a proxy  for someone else the nerd has a gender  neutral name on his nameplate and it
MB5sOpij7aU,1539679,1544960,helped him hide that he was playing in  place of a female friend he dressed up  as a woman to participate in the liar's
MB5sOpij7aU,1544960,1550559,game but used his disguise to take  advantage of the other player and steal  her cash before the game began once he
MB5sOpij7aU,1550559,1556159,was inside he took off his disguise and  nobody would suspect it was him because  they thought the culprit was female he
MB5sOpij7aU,1556159,1561919,then tried to convince them the woman in  the sunglasses was the thief but akiyama  explains he made one huge mistake
MB5sOpij7aU,1561919,1567600,earlier he mentioned that the woman must  have stolen a check instead of cash but  nobody else knew that information and it
MB5sOpij7aU,1567600,1573520,gave away that this nerd was the thief  furious the man argues that he still has  one more round to win the game and they
MB5sOpij7aU,1573520,1579760,continue playing but this time the agent  chooses akiyama to ask the final  question stepping up to the platform he
MB5sOpij7aU,1579760,1585039,asks whether or not the most important  thing in life is money and suddenly  shows his card to the entire room before
MB5sOpij7aU,1585039,1591600,dropping it into the box the others  can't believe what he's doing but the  con man explains that with only three  players left to vote it will be
MB5sOpij7aU,1591600,1597279,impossible for the last player to join  the minority and he's guaranteed to win  they now have six hours to vote and this
MB5sOpij7aU,1597279,1602640,man tries to figure out what the others  will do when he suddenly has a clever  idea approaching the nerd he suggests
MB5sOpij7aU,1602640,1607919,they form a new team splitting their  votes between the two choices so neither  of them will lose it's a decent strategy
MB5sOpij7aU,1607919,1613200,but the nerd points out that everyone  else has overheard his plan and now  they'll end up locked in a tie that's
MB5sOpij7aU,1613200,1620080,when the woman approaches them and drops  a truth bomb revealing that all he has  to do to beat the con man is to form a  larger team of three the men find it
MB5sOpij7aU,1620080,1625679,hard to believe and point out there  won't be enough money to pay off the  debts of the other team members but the  woman plans on moving on to the next
MB5sOpij7aU,1625679,1631120,round that means half of their earnings  won't be taken by the agents and demands  a larger cut of the reward money leaving
MB5sOpij7aU,1631120,1637520,a little over 1 million yen for the nerd  as punishment for his betrayal okay this  was a risky strategy but there's still a
MB5sOpij7aU,1637520,1642720,good chance that it will pay off if  we're careful akiyama used his time  wisely by casting his vote first for
MB5sOpij7aU,1642720,1648480,everyone to see and this move instantly  gave him the upper hand the next player  is forced to vote yes since the only
MB5sOpij7aU,1648480,1653679,other choice is to join the majority  which would make him instantly lose this  strategy could have actually been used
MB5sOpij7aU,1653679,1659039,earlier in the game as well but it would  have been much less effective the reason  is because when there are more people
MB5sOpij7aU,1659039,1665440,it's harder to visualize the final  result but in a group of four the  players are able to see how each vote  will affect the final outcome what's
MB5sOpij7aU,1665440,1670480,most interesting is that nobody rushed  in to be the second player to vote we  want to make sure that our vote isn't
MB5sOpij7aU,1670480,1675919,trapped in the majority and whoever  votes second will be safer but whoever  votes third is more likely to lose
MB5sOpij7aU,1675919,1681279,because he becomes the majority no  matter what side he chooses the fourth  player has a chance to tie the game but
MB5sOpij7aU,1681279,1687039,if nobody else shows their votes before  casting it they might choose the wrong  side and force a majority by accident as
MB5sOpij7aU,1687039,1693279,the second voter this gives you a 33  chance to win and that's a lot better  than zero forming a new team also has
MB5sOpij7aU,1693279,1698480,less benefit now because if they win  they're contractually bound to share all  the earnings and since there will be two
MB5sOpij7aU,1698480,1703840,full teams to split it with instead of  one they'll only get half as much as  before this woman completely changed the
MB5sOpij7aU,1703840,1710000,dynamics here because she decided she  would play in the third round which  doubles the prize money and this makes  team building a worthwhile strategy
MB5sOpij7aU,1710000,1715200,again now in a situation where people  are acting selfishly the smart approach  is forcing them to think that the only
MB5sOpij7aU,1715200,1721120,way to benefit is to cooperate there was  a great example of this on a show called  golden balls which used the game theory
MB5sOpij7aU,1721120,1726640,problem of the prisoner's dilemma as the  premise two players must decide to  either steal all the prize money or
MB5sOpij7aU,1726640,1732240,split it between them but if they both  decide to steal they each get nothing  now what's so fascinating is that this
MB5sOpij7aU,1732240,1737840,man here single-handedly broke the  entire game his strategy was to tell his  opponent that he was going to steal but
MB5sOpij7aU,1737840,1744559,prowess to share the money after the  show it sounds crazy because if he  really wanted to share it that he could  have chosen split but the genius here is
MB5sOpij7aU,1744559,1750320,that it gave the other player no option  to steal it for himself with no better  choice he decided to split and later
MB5sOpij7aU,1750320,1755679,found out his opponent also picked slit  the producers recognized that this  strategy would break the game and cancel
MB5sOpij7aU,1755679,1761039,the show that same season this is a  great example of why sometimes the best  strategy is to convince your opponent
MB5sOpij7aU,1761039,1766320,that his only choice is to cooperate and  if they believe you that you might both  get what you want in the end desperate
MB5sOpij7aU,1766320,1771760,to remain in the game the man begs them  to turn this vote into a draw and the  woman agrees but insists she'll put
MB5sOpij7aU,1771760,1777200,everyone's ballots into the box for them  it's the easiest way to ensure no one  can cheat and she puts all their cards
MB5sOpij7aU,1777200,1782640,in but this was their biggest mistake  the nerd confronts akiyama confident  that he's going to lose but that's when
MB5sOpij7aU,1782640,1787919,he stands up and reveals they've just  been tricked the agent begins to  announce the final results but suddenly
MB5sOpij7aU,1787919,1794559,she tells them that the woman voted yes  turning them into the majority the men  don't understand what happened and  akiyama explains that he's working with
MB5sOpij7aU,1794559,1800640,the woman she reveals that she never  wanted to move on to the next game and  secretly made plans of the con man so  they could wipe out the remaining
MB5sOpij7aU,1800640,1805679,opponents by baiting the nerd into  asking for a draw the only thing akiya  had to do to convince the woman was let
MB5sOpij7aU,1805679,1810960,her hold on to his nameplate as  insurance and that means the nerd has  lost suddenly the dealer announces the
MB5sOpij7aU,1810960,1816480,second round is over and the winner can  claim his prize taking him to another  room the agent gives akiyama the reward
MB5sOpij7aU,1816480,1822880,of 2.1 billion yen and tells him that he  can either continue playing the game or  give back half his money to quit after
MB5sOpij7aU,1822880,1828320,making his decision he heads back home  with now and she asks how much money he  gave to the woman with the sunglasses he
MB5sOpij7aU,1828320,1834320,reveals that she received 1.2 billion  yen and the rest of his prize money will  be used to pay off everyone's debts the
MB5sOpij7aU,1834320,1840880,girl doesn't understand how he has that  much cash but the man reveals that he's  going to enter the third round  continuing the game until he can finally
MB5sOpij7aU,1840880,1846480,confront the masterminds the next  morning the girl tries to call akiyama  worried that he's taking on too much to
MB5sOpij7aU,1846480,1852640,handle but he refuses to answer suddenly  she hears a knock on her door and when  she opens it finds the fake cop waiting
MB5sOpij7aU,1852640,1859360,for her on the other side she  immediately shuts it yelling at him to  leave her alone but he reveals that  there's a way she can help the con man
MB5sOpij7aU,1859360,1864480,feeling guilty the girl lets him inside  and he tells her that three days from  now there will be a private game for the
MB5sOpij7aU,1864480,1870480,losers of the second round if she wins  now has a chance to win enough money to  pay for akiyama's quitting fee but the
MB5sOpij7aU,1870480,1876000,girl is terrified she won't have any  help this time and the man makes it  clear that this is the only opportunity
MB5sOpij7aU,1876000,1881679,the hc will give to save her friend  three days later she goes to the  location of this revival round where the
MB5sOpij7aU,1881679,1886880,agent welcomes her back to the  tournament walking inside the arcade the  girl reunites with several losers from
MB5sOpij7aU,1886880,1892880,the last game but that's when she  realizes that the thief okunaga is also  here and he's bitter about losing
MB5sOpij7aU,1892880,1898480,suddenly the tv screen turns on and the  dealer welcomes them to their next  challenge their goal is to steal 100
MB5sOpij7aU,1898480,1904159,million yen and those who win will be  forced to play in the next round but  this makes them all furious they came
MB5sOpij7aU,1904159,1910720,here hoping to pay off their debts and  the dealer makes it clear that the  winners will not only be able to pay off  what they owe but also win a huge sum of
MB5sOpij7aU,1910720,1916720,cash none of them can afford to turn on  the offer and the players decide to stay  knowing this is their only real option
MB5sOpij7aU,1916720,1921919,with that the doors are locked from the  inside and the dealer explains that  first they must choose one person to
MB5sOpij7aU,1921919,1927360,kick out of the tournament so that the  winner of this revival round can take  their place now here is terrified of
