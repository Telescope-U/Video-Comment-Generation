BMwyxh9UzNI,0,6000,"Hello, welcome to FastGoodCuisine, today is the return of a concept: The worst versus the best."
BMwyxh9UzNI,6000,8000,"And this time, we're going to tackle fast food."
BMwyxh9UzNI,8000,9000,That's what makes you sick!
BMwyxh9UzNI,10000,11000,- It really is a treat!
BMwyxh9UzNI,11000,13000,"Ah, that's not good at all, huh!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,13000,17000,"- That's the problem. You see me I was told ""You go to the FastGood channel, you're going to eat well"" but not at all there in fact!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,17000,22000,"At first you will eat very, very badly and then we will bounce back and get the taste."
BMwyxh9UzNI,22000,26500,"- You know that I am very complicated to find the worst. Really, I'm used to eating things that aren't too much..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,26500,30000,We've seen. We'll put a little mix of your little tastings.
BMwyxh9UzNI,32000,34500,"I don't know how you do. If so, you'll love it! - If it is, I'm going to love it, huh."
BMwyxh9UzNI,34500,37000,"Alright, let's go, we're going to order from the worst snack bar. Let's go."
BMwyxh9UzNI,39000,40000,Oh the smell... It smells of PMU.
BMwyxh9UzNI,40000,47000,"*A veritable nest of bacteria. The rags, the premises, the dishes, the sanitary condition of the premises is overwhelming.*"
BMwyxh9UzNI,47500,52000,"I saw things... Me, that worried me! The Cheddar was a little sour like that."
BMwyxh9UzNI,52000,58000,"It was sitting in the thing, I think it had been there for two, three days drying out. - I hadn't even burnt that it was Cheddar outright. It looked like sideways or..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,58000,59000,Ahhhhh!!
BMwyxh9UzNI,59000,62000,"I'll read you some reviews, okay? To whet your appetite. - Ok."
BMwyxh9UzNI,62000,64000,"So, three weeks ago. - Besides, it's recent!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,64000,65000,"Ah yes, it's recent huh."
BMwyxh9UzNI,65000,69000,"Just went there today with a friend, we both left with stomach cramps."
BMwyxh9UzNI,69000,73000,The toilets at work remember it...
BMwyxh9UzNI,73000,74000,Now my colleagues laugh at me.
BMwyxh9UzNI,74000,75500,You have nothing to do this after-me?
BMwyxh9UzNI,75500,78000,"- You know, the worst thing is that I bought Spasfon."
BMwyxh9UzNI,78000,81500,"Did you come with a small survival kit? - So. I said to myself ""I don't know what he's getting me into""."
BMwyxh9UzNI,81500,84000,Disgusting. Really! Stomach ache since last night.
BMwyxh9UzNI,84000,87000,- There's no good opinion like? Because I didn't spoil myself at all There are only one stars .
BMwyxh9UzNI,87000,89500,"And on the other hand, there is someone:"
BMwyxh9UzNI,89500,94000,"*The staff is always friendly' and the falafel sandwich with fries, the ideal snack and not expensive.*"
BMwyxh9UzNI,94000,96000,- It may be he who put his comment. It's weird
BMwyxh9UzNI,96000,98000,because there's only one five star and the rest...
BMwyxh9UzNI,98000,104000,because I'm currently in the toilet because this Greek made me sick.*
BMwyxh9UzNI,104000,107500,"The only thing that made me want it was the real fries. The sauce shines, it seems..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,107500,110500,"- The sauce gives less desire than fries but fries, yeah it's ok in real life."
BMwyxh9UzNI,110500,111500,"In real life, the smell is good."
BMwyxh9UzNI,113500,115000,"In real life, it's ok! - It doesn't revolutionize fries."
BMwyxh9UzNI,115000,117500,Good frozen fries that do the trick.
BMwyxh9UzNI,117500,123500,- You am using this i am not going to complain about an app. To do this it I really have to be in the toilet because...
BMwyxh9UzNI,123500,129000,"On the other hand, the smell of barbecue sauce scoured my nostrils. I just did a PCR test. - The sauce on the other hand, I'm less of a fan."
BMwyxh9UzNI,129000,133500,Is it me or does it taste like vinegar? - It doesn't have the sugar of barbecue sauce at all.
BMwyxh9UzNI,135500,137000,"- On the other hand, I'm going to eat them without the sauce."
BMwyxh9UzNI,137000,142000,"What is that ? Ola! - In truth, I think it's the thing that will make me hate the least..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,142000,147000,"Honestly, it's a joke! Look at the size of the steak! Look what I have! - I admit..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,147000,152000,In fact it's a salad toast. Find out why one side is grilled and the other charred. - And what is it? It's barbecue again.
BMwyxh9UzNI,155500,157000,- The sauce is undrinkable!
BMwyxh9UzNI,159000,165000,"- I don't really feel the... Ah yes! The sauce masks all the taste for me. Ah no, there I took a good piece of steak."
BMwyxh9UzNI,165000,166500,So ? - He is not good.
BMwyxh9UzNI,166500,171000,"In comparison, it's no worse than the tacos that were inedible on the taco episode."
BMwyxh9UzNI,172000,173500,It's disgusting.
BMwyxh9UzNI,173500,175500,"But in truth, I think if you eat all that, you don't end up very well."
BMwyxh9UzNI,175500,179500,"- I ate it, eh, during my life, but bread doesn't inspire me at all. What is that ?"
BMwyxh9UzNI,179500,184000,"The white sauce... Ola! There's something you see right away, it's grainy, look at the fries!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,184000,187000,- Looks like toothpaste. That for me is decisive.
BMwyxh9UzNI,187000,189000,- I'll take a fry that is well soaked.
BMwyxh9UzNI,191500,195800,- Oh no... Oh no the sauces... Houu! She's sour! That's what makes you sick!
BMwyxh9UzNI,195800,197000,"- No, she's not good at all."
BMwyxh9UzNI,197000,203000,"- Yet he had plastic tubes. It looked like the ones you can buy at the big box stores, but maybe he's re-filling them with something else."
BMwyxh9UzNI,203000,209000,To me the sauce actually tastes like expired sauce. It's not normal for a cheese sauce to be sour like that.
BMwyxh9UzNI,209000,211000,Olala... And what worries me a lot is the bread.
BMwyxh9UzNI,211000,216500,"- Bread can't do anything to you, but meat... I swear, it really looks like toothpaste. The one you spit in the sink."
BMwyxh9UzNI,219500,220500,"- Oh no, the sauce..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,221000,223500,"- In truth, I don't smell the meat, there's so much sauce."
BMwyxh9UzNI,226000,230500,"- Nope. In truth, the meat at the beginning is fine, but there is a kind of attic aftertaste."
BMwyxh9UzNI,230500,237000,"- Oh no ! Looks like I just dusted some meat. At first, I thought it was normal, but it really looks like something you forgot behind the sink."
BMwyxh9UzNI,237000,244500,"I tell you something: the smell, the meat... Not repugnant to me, but it puts a certain distance. Normally when you smell the kebab, it makes you hungry."
BMwyxh9UzNI,250000,252000,"Dude, that's not good at all huh!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,252000,255500,"- Oh yeah ? Me, I'm used to eating things that aren't too good, so that... Oh, but you're sick of yourself!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,255500,258500,"- Yeah, I think I've eaten worse so it doesn't shock me as much as you."
BMwyxh9UzNI,258500,260500,"When I crunched, I had a small piece of bone there..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,261200,264000,We will say that it is passable but really at the end of the evening what.
BMwyxh9UzNI,264000,268000,"The only thing I remember is the fries without sauce. Not disgusting what. - Yes, without sauce."
BMwyxh9UzNI,268000,272500,Nah but frankly... Fat?! - The slice... Even she doesn't know what she's doing there like.
BMwyxh9UzNI,272500,277500,"Oh no, but I hate that! The bread was toasted on the bottom so now it's dry."
BMwyxh9UzNI,280000,282500,- Ro *BIP* it's barbecue again! The trap !
BMwyxh9UzNI,282500,287500,"- In real life, it really looks like... One day I made burgers myself that looked something like that, but failed."
BMwyxh9UzNI,287500,289000,"- The sauce, I can't."
BMwyxh9UzNI,289000,292500,We will end this tasting with this magnificent burger worthy of a scam.
BMwyxh9UzNI,295500,298000,The sauce is awful! Looks like pickled jam.
BMwyxh9UzNI,298000,301000,"I have tomato juice. It's like... Ah, that's too much!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,301000,305000,Now we are going to bounce back by going to test the best fast food in Paris.
BMwyxh9UzNI,305000,308500,It's much better than what we tasted before. - Change of total universe.
BMwyxh9UzNI,308500,314500,"We're going to try another restaurant afterwards, we already know it's the best. - Visually it is very beautiful and very loaded especially."
BMwyxh9UzNI,314500,319500,"Above all, I wanted really fat tenders. You know, not toddlers without chicken."
BMwyxh9UzNI,319500,324000,"- Especially there, when you receive this and you open it, you don't tell yourself that the guy has half filled the box."
BMwyxh9UzNI,324000,327000,- They look amazing and the size is monumental!
BMwyxh9UzNI,329500,332500,- Mmm it's hot but it's good! I have the impression that you love it!
BMwyxh9UzNI,332500,337000,"- Especially since I'm a big chicken specialist, huh. This is why his opinion is very important."
BMwyxh9UzNI,337000,342000,"- Especially since the size, we agree, is it a dish that is taken as a dish? Yes Yes Yes Yes."
BMwyxh9UzNI,342000,347500,"I'm telling you for having experimented, that's a sauce in FastGood mode. It is not at all like a classic barbecue sauce."
BMwyxh9UzNI,347500,352000,- I'm not going to expect a barbecue sauce uh... It's inexplicable. You have to taste it to understand.
BMwyxh9UzNI,355500,360000,- The sauce is amazing and the chicken too! It's tender! The chicken is actually not dry.
BMwyxh9UzNI,360000,367000,"- Well I was in Japan, I've been to a lot of countries and I mostly eat bad stuff but I also eat good stuff"
BMwyxh9UzNI,367000,370500,"- and really, it's very, very, very, very, very, very good! You really didn't miss it."
BMwyxh9UzNI,370500,376000,"In any case, if you want to order, good luck because at the moment it's complicated, we can't follow but in any case..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,376000,379000,Look at that! - Nothing but the bread...
BMwyxh9UzNI,379000,384500,"And there it is above all that you understand why it is important to have big tenderds. Because now you feel like you're going to eat chicken, you know?"
BMwyxh9UzNI,389500,393500,- Unbelievable ! The crispy and softness of the tender. You see the bread which takes the form of...
BMwyxh9UzNI,394000,395000,"- Well done, but what's the sauce?"
BMwyxh9UzNI,395000,400000,"Ahhhh the Pepe sauce is a secret sauce, I can't tell what's in it. - Oh, is it a secret sauce? She is incredible !"
BMwyxh9UzNI,400000,404500,"- When it's very good and everything goes together just as well, you can type it out of greed. That's wonderful."
BMwyxh9UzNI,404500,410500,"- And really, it's not paying you compliments to pay you compliments, I tell you sincerely. It makes me very happy that you like it! I'm so happy."
BMwyxh9UzNI,417000,420000,Here is the best part! - It has nothing to do ! The slice of cheese...
BMwyxh9UzNI,420000,425500,"There it is well melted. Frankly, the kebab! - Just aesthetics is..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,425500,430500,"And the fries, there's a little bit of spice on them. - Already the white sauce has absolutely nothing to do with texture."
BMwyxh9UzNI,433500,437000,Wow!! Wow!! It's super fresh! - It has nothing to do with it!
BMwyxh9UzNI,437000,442500,- There I could only lick the sauce without the fries. Frankly I think it's one of the best kebab sauce I've tasted in Paris.
BMwyxh9UzNI,442500,445000,The fries and the white sauce are clearly validated.
BMwyxh9UzNI,445000,448000,"Already when you have to flatten the kebab, it's a good sign."
BMwyxh9UzNI,448000,450000,"We have feta cheese, small vegetables,..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,453000,454500,Have you heard how crispy the bread is?
BMwyxh9UzNI,455500,460000,- Unbelievable ! Nothing to see! No aftertaste and bread is bread!
BMwyxh9UzNI,460000,461000,- You are well informed.
BMwyxh9UzNI,461000,466000,Frankly you feel that the meat is well grilled and it is colorful. - This is really a treat.
BMwyxh9UzNI,468000,470000,- Already when you can fix a normal croc...
BMwyxh9UzNI,472000,479000,"- The bread is amazing too! You can tell it's fresh bread. In the other, you saw that it was the plastic bags that remained in the window for"
BMwyxh9UzNI,479000,480000,"10, 15 days."
BMwyxh9UzNI,480000,489000,"It's amazing and very fresh! Compared to an O Berliner or a Gemüse for people who have references to Berliner kebabs in Paris. Same level huh, it's very, very good."
BMwyxh9UzNI,489000,490500,For me it's the meat that is amazing.
BMwyxh9UzNI,490500,497000,"- The sauce has no aftertaste while in the other it was so strong that it ruins everything. - Already the bread ruined everything, the meat even worse!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,497000,499500,"Is this the best kebab you have eaten? You can say ""No""."
BMwyxh9UzNI,499500,502000,"- I don't think it's the best but it's in the top 3, by a wide margin."
BMwyxh9UzNI,502000,503000,And what's the best you've tasted?
BMwyxh9UzNI,503000,513000,"- The best I've tasted? It was in Split, Croatia. I had eaten one this summer which was amazing but it didn't really look like... It was a kebab but a modified version from Croatia."
BMwyxh9UzNI,513000,515000,"If I go to Croatia, I will test."
BMwyxh9UzNI,515000,520000,Rolla! - Open it so that we can see that there is not a slice of sad cheese inside.
BMwyxh9UzNI,520000,526000,"In truth, I find the burger really nice, but you feel like you're in a kebab restaurant because you see the burger"
BMwyxh9UzNI,526000,527500,"- That's a plus. Yes, that's a plus."
BMwyxh9UzNI,530000,535500,"- It has nothing to do. Me it's the attic meat that shocked me in the other. ""Attic meat""!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,535500,538500,"- But there... Do you approve? - Ah I validate, almost strong!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,538500,543000,What I really like is when the Cheddar is well melted. I think this is going to be really good.
BMwyxh9UzNI,548500,550000,"Simple, effective, but validated."
BMwyxh9UzNI,550000,552500,"- When you have tasted the other before, you can only validate."
BMwyxh9UzNI,552500,559000,"Yeah but even compared to a burger we'll say uh... For me, that, in terms of taste, we feel that we are not on a top premium burger."
BMwyxh9UzNI,559000,561000,"- The steak isn't colossal either, but..."
BMwyxh9UzNI,561000,566000,"We're on a good burger and I'd give the burger a seven out of ten. - Yeah and I would say six and a half, seven, the same."
BMwyxh9UzNI,566000,570000,"And for the kebab, a good nine me. - Yeah, I think eight and a half, nine, the same."
BMwyxh9UzNI,570000,571000,- We didn't give notes for each other.
BMwyxh9UzNI,571000,574000,"Fries: Five. - Yeah, five because it's edible."
BMwyxh9UzNI,574500,575500,"Burgers, two. - Of them."
BMwyxh9UzNI,575500,583000,Zero kebab it was awful. - I would put one for the effort that the guy gave but... And sauce: Minus ten thousand!
BMwyxh9UzNI,583000,587000,"I have a stomach ache. How are you feeling ? - Well, I would have preferred to start at the end."
BMwyxh9UzNI,587000,593000,"Well, anyway the worst was really horrible. We retain the toothpaste sauce. - Horrible ! And the taste of the attic!"
BMwyxh9UzNI,593000,594000,And the taste of the attic! That was...
BMwyxh9UzNI,594500,599000,"We were able to bounce back and by the way, tell us in the comments if we should do other episodes like this."
BMwyxh9UzNI,599000,603000,In any case go and check... You're full Twitter?! - I am full Twitter and Instagram.
BMwyxh9UzNI,603000,605000,"And with that, we're going to leave and cia-ciao!"
