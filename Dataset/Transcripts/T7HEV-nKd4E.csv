T7HEV-nKd4E,199,1199,Hi!
T7HEV-nKd4E,1199,2199,"I'm Sunako, a freelance artist."
T7HEV-nKd4E,2199,7200,"I often like to use photos for my art, and I think it's a nice way to get into drawing"
T7HEV-nKd4E,7200,11799,"your characters in more realistic scenes and lighting, so I thought I would make a video"
T7HEV-nKd4E,11799,14400,to explain my process for doing this.
T7HEV-nKd4E,14400,19330,To keep it simple I'll focus on using just one photo as a base.
T7HEV-nKd4E,19330,23590,"The first thing you need for this is the photo, or the idea for the photo."
T7HEV-nKd4E,23590,29180,"I recommend taking the photo yourself, it can be a good excuse for going out."
T7HEV-nKd4E,29180,32340,Most smartphone cameras are totally good enough for this.
T7HEV-nKd4E,32340,36680,"If you can't take the photo yourself, you should use a copyright free photo that you"
T7HEV-nKd4E,36680,41220,can find from a site like Pixabay or Unsplash.
T7HEV-nKd4E,41220,45020,Try to keep in mind the character's position when you take those pictures.
T7HEV-nKd4E,45020,49000,Imagine where the character would be when you take a photo.
T7HEV-nKd4E,49000,53110,"Personally I like to think that a ghost is posing for me, and I'm taking pictures of"
T7HEV-nKd4E,53110,54110,them.
T7HEV-nKd4E,54110,58570,This is helpful for getting pics that work well as character art backgrounds.
T7HEV-nKd4E,58570,64030,"Also rather than taking pictures that are too bright, take some that are too dark, in"
T7HEV-nKd4E,64030,70840,case you can't get the perfect exposure.
T7HEV-nKd4E,70840,75850,"When you have your picture ready, you can do a few things before continuing, such as"
T7HEV-nKd4E,75850,80630,"straightening it, fixing distortion, rotation, or brightness."
T7HEV-nKd4E,80630,82889,You can do this in any art program.
T7HEV-nKd4E,82889,88929,"I would advice against doing any drastic color filters or adjustments yet, because I find"
T7HEV-nKd4E,88929,94499,it easier to paint my character with the same type of lighting as the picture if it's not
T7HEV-nKd4E,94499,95990,heavily edited.
T7HEV-nKd4E,95990,101389,"You might also need to run the photo through some upscaling or downscaling, if it's too"
T7HEV-nKd4E,101389,103920,different from your preferred canvas size.
T7HEV-nKd4E,103920,112438,"Generally upscaling is not good to do, but if I have to I don't mind doing it a bit because"
T7HEV-nKd4E,112439,115490,I will paint over a lot of parts anyway.
T7HEV-nKd4E,115490,120798,"Next I usually run the photo through a stylized filter, unless I'm planning to paint over"
T7HEV-nKd4E,120799,122439,all of it completely.
T7HEV-nKd4E,122439,127439,"For this purpose Photoshop has quite a lot of filters, but for this artwork I used a"
T7HEV-nKd4E,127439,132099,free program called FotoSketcher which is also very good for this.
T7HEV-nKd4E,132099,136920,It's quite slow to process but it's got a lot of different filters and many adjustments
T7HEV-nKd4E,136920,138040,for each of them.
T7HEV-nKd4E,138040,143510,I ended up using the third one under the painting category with some slight adjustments to the
T7HEV-nKd4E,143510,144510,default settings.
T7HEV-nKd4E,144510,149069,Now I'll let the speedpaint of this artwork run while I explain the rest.
T7HEV-nKd4E,149069,155769,"So I made a new canvas in Clip Studio Paint in A3 paper 300 pixels per inch size, which"
T7HEV-nKd4E,155769,160430,is how I usually work because I want to be able to make prints of my art.
T7HEV-nKd4E,160430,165510,In pixels it's about 5000 wide and 3500 tall.
T7HEV-nKd4E,165510,169209,You don't have to use such a large size if you don't want or need it.
T7HEV-nKd4E,169209,176000,My photo that I took with my phone was a bit too small so I had to upscale it a bit.
T7HEV-nKd4E,176000,181730,"When placing your character, don't just place it anywhere but keep in mind the basic composition"
T7HEV-nKd4E,181730,182730,rules.
T7HEV-nKd4E,182730,187260,Try to get the character's face in the spot where it would look the best to have a focal
T7HEV-nKd4E,187260,188260,point.
T7HEV-nKd4E,188260,192879,"In this case I just thought about the rule of thirds, and how the lines of the window"
T7HEV-nKd4E,192880,198730,frames and perspective are guiding your eyes towards that corner where the chair is.
T7HEV-nKd4E,198730,203319,Sometimes you might have to crop the photo quite a lot or zoom into it a lot to get a
T7HEV-nKd4E,203319,204930,nice composition.
T7HEV-nKd4E,204930,210730,In some cases such as this I actually opt to extend the picture by painting in the missing
T7HEV-nKd4E,210730,211920,bits.
T7HEV-nKd4E,211920,216459,Usually if it's just a bit missing like that from the edges you can pretty easily figure
T7HEV-nKd4E,216459,222269,"out what should be there and paint it in, or even use photoshop's content aware fill."
T7HEV-nKd4E,222269,227640,"An extra thing you can do to help with drawing the character, that you can do for any art,"
T7HEV-nKd4E,227640,231319,is take a photo of yourself in the right pose and angle.
T7HEV-nKd4E,231319,234379,Even better if you can have the same direction of sunlight.
T7HEV-nKd4E,234379,238370,Sometimes I just take a few quick selfies in the background photo location.
T7HEV-nKd4E,238370,243689,The best would be if you could pose wherever your background photo was taken so you'd have
T7HEV-nKd4E,243689,249939,"one version with no person in it and one with a person in it, but most of the time this"
T7HEV-nKd4E,249939,255439,isn't feasible so I just take pose reference pics at my room at home.
T7HEV-nKd4E,255439,260620,"You can do this by putting your phone or camera on a tripod, and using a bluetooth shutter."
T7HEV-nKd4E,260620,264910,And if you take screenshots from a video you don't even need the shutter.
T7HEV-nKd4E,264910,271080,"A tripod with a ball head so you can angle it, and a basic phone clamp to hold your phone"
T7HEV-nKd4E,271080,272810,is all you really need.
T7HEV-nKd4E,272810,277310,Or a regular tripod with a fancier phone clamp that can be turned and angled.
T7HEV-nKd4E,277310,282090,"But all this is just extra, you don't really need to do this unless you want to."
T7HEV-nKd4E,282090,288840,So the amount of painting over the photo that you want to do depends on your own preferences.
T7HEV-nKd4E,288840,293919,"You don't have to do it at all if you don't want to, or you could just paint over the"
T7HEV-nKd4E,293920,294920,foreground.
T7HEV-nKd4E,294920,299780,"If I'm not painting over everything, I like to paint over things that I feel like look"
T7HEV-nKd4E,299780,302060,too much like a photo still.
T7HEV-nKd4E,302060,307600,"But my main objective with the paintover is controlling the amount of details, such as"
T7HEV-nKd4E,307600,312790,here the first thing I do is get to painting over the windows because there's an insane
T7HEV-nKd4E,312790,315840,amount of detail there in the trees outside.
T7HEV-nKd4E,315840,320480,"It felt like too much, like it's taking away attention from the character."
T7HEV-nKd4E,320480,325550,"But I bring back some of the detail, because I still want to keep the lush feel of the"
T7HEV-nKd4E,325550,331460,greenery and because the strong texture of the trees outside creates contrast to the
T7HEV-nKd4E,331460,334710,mostly smooth textures on the inside.
T7HEV-nKd4E,334710,338350,Use your own intuition to balance the background in this way.
T7HEV-nKd4E,338350,344880,"A good thing to remember is that generally, things that are further away should have less"
T7HEV-nKd4E,344880,351380,"detail than things that are close up, and things in the shadow and dark areas can have"
T7HEV-nKd4E,351380,354400,less detail than areas in sunlight.
T7HEV-nKd4E,354400,360560,The most detail is visible in areas of sunlight that are close to you or the focal point.
T7HEV-nKd4E,360560,365650,"While you're working, always keep in mind your focal point, which is usually the character's"
T7HEV-nKd4E,365650,369660,"face, and think about how you could bring more attention to it."
T7HEV-nKd4E,369660,373360,"Or in reverse, remove attention from other areas."
T7HEV-nKd4E,373360,381638,"Some examples are contrasting values, warm vs cool colors, and contrast in detail, texture,"
T7HEV-nKd4E,381639,383450,or sharpness of edges.
T7HEV-nKd4E,383450,387830,"This is a really broad topic that could use it's own video to be honest, and I'm sure"
T7HEV-nKd4E,387830,389860,many of them exist already.
T7HEV-nKd4E,389860,394569,"You can also move, remove, or add things to your photo."
T7HEV-nKd4E,394570,398180,It's much easier to add things than to remove or move them.
T7HEV-nKd4E,398180,403070,"I added an extra hanging plant in place of what was there on the wall before, and I was"
T7HEV-nKd4E,403070,408970,"also considering moving the tomato plant behind the character, because composition wise it's"
T7HEV-nKd4E,408970,413150,"not in a good place, but unfortunately I got a bit lazy."
T7HEV-nKd4E,413150,418830,"If you move or remove something you'll have to paint in what was there underneath it,"
T7HEV-nKd4E,418830,424370,and this can be a hassle if the section underneath is complex like the corner section of these
T7HEV-nKd4E,424370,425460,window frames.
T7HEV-nKd4E,425460,430759,I also decided to paint over the potted plants on the table to make the shapes more clear
T7HEV-nKd4E,430760,431910,and balanced.
T7HEV-nKd4E,431910,437060,"If I was really putting in maximum effort, I would also draw some outlines for the leaves"
T7HEV-nKd4E,437060,440860,and detail them a bit more instead of these blobs of color.
T7HEV-nKd4E,440860,446349,In this paintover stage is where you can really make the most difference in the artistic sense.
T7HEV-nKd4E,446350,452550,"A filtered photo is in the end just a filtered photo, the filter doesn't know what to emphasize"
T7HEV-nKd4E,452550,456580,"or simplify, or how to make it the most visually pleasing."
T7HEV-nKd4E,456580,462830,"We can take some liberties to simplify and emphasize shapes, to make things more appealing."
T7HEV-nKd4E,462830,468060,"When you paint in your character, you should try your best to use the same lighting as"
T7HEV-nKd4E,468060,469419,the photo has.
T7HEV-nKd4E,469420,474360,It's really useful to know realistic light and color theory for this step.
T7HEV-nKd4E,474360,480039,"A book that I would highly recommend reading is Color and Light by James Gourney, that"
T7HEV-nKd4E,480040,483600,book has it all and for me it was invaluable.
T7HEV-nKd4E,483600,486830,The videos of Marco Bucci are also very good.
T7HEV-nKd4E,486830,492550,"If you understand the theory for each lighting scenario, you'll be able to know how to color"
T7HEV-nKd4E,492550,494159,your character.
T7HEV-nKd4E,494160,498900,"In this photo, the afternoon sun, which is the main light, is coming into the room at"
T7HEV-nKd4E,498900,499900,an angle.
T7HEV-nKd4E,499900,503900,"The walls and roof of the room are creamy white, and the floor is red."
T7HEV-nKd4E,503900,508910,The sunlight bouncing around this room would then create a warm ambient light for this
T7HEV-nKd4E,508910,512789,"scene, as well as sunlight being a warm type of light to begin with."
T7HEV-nKd4E,512789,519590,"The sky is also mostly clear, so I can add a dash of blue in the planes that face upwards,"
T7HEV-nKd4E,519590,522200,since she is sitting next to the window.
T7HEV-nKd4E,522200,527780,Those upwards facing planes would have a direct line of sight to the sky.
T7HEV-nKd4E,527780,533860,In this way you can analyse the photo and then color your character in a way that fits
T7HEV-nKd4E,533860,539899,"and looks like they're actually in there, and not like they have been pasted in."
T7HEV-nKd4E,539900,545170,This is why I would really recommend that book which has all the info on almost every
T7HEV-nKd4E,545170,549630,"type of lighting that you might encounter, including artificial lights."
T7HEV-nKd4E,549630,554990,I'm still not the best or fastest when it comes to the character art and I usually make
T7HEV-nKd4E,554990,559740,"many revisions throughout, but I like to think that I get there in the end."
T7HEV-nKd4E,559740,565140,"Honestly, my brain going on autopilot and having these preconceived notions of what"
T7HEV-nKd4E,565140,569740,"anime art ""should"" look like are my worst stumbling blocks."
T7HEV-nKd4E,569740,574339,"Stick to the fundamental theory and you'll do good, and don't forget to zoom out and"
T7HEV-nKd4E,574340,577530,check the overall balance.
T7HEV-nKd4E,577530,582580,"Remember to add shadow and ambient occlusion under your character, and also keep in mind"
T7HEV-nKd4E,582580,586870,any structures that would obstruct the light that is hitting your character in the case
T7HEV-nKd4E,586870,588730,of sunlight.
T7HEV-nKd4E,588730,593000,"Here I almost forgot about the window frame, as you might have noticed."
T7HEV-nKd4E,593000,598520,"In this way, keep going until you're satisfied with the look and balance of your artwork."
T7HEV-nKd4E,598520,607790,"Towards the end I add any effects, such as extra glow, or extra light rays, blur, sharpening,"
T7HEV-nKd4E,607790,612300,"additional contrast or lowering contrast, etc."
T7HEV-nKd4E,612300,618410,You can do this in any program but I prefer to go to photoshop for my post processing.
T7HEV-nKd4E,618410,626370,This last step is very up to your personal preferences.
T7HEV-nKd4E,626370,631150,This is where I'd add any overall filters to the colors as well.
T7HEV-nKd4E,631150,637090,"In this case I didn't edit it that noticeably, but it did become a bit warmer and brighter."
T7HEV-nKd4E,637090,641550,At an earlier point I did also blur the outside of the windows just a little bit.
T7HEV-nKd4E,641550,642880,And then we are done!
T7HEV-nKd4E,642880,645399,I hope this video was helpful.
T7HEV-nKd4E,645399,648760,Please leave a comment if you have any questions or feedback.
T7HEV-nKd4E,648760,654029,"If you'd like to support me on making more artwork and youtube content, check out my"
T7HEV-nKd4E,654029,655029,patreon.
T7HEV-nKd4E,655029,660850,I upload speedpaints and the files of almost all my drawings as I make them.
T7HEV-nKd4E,660850,663290,Thank you very much for watching and have a great day! :)
