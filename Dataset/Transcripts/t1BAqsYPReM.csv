t1BAqsYPReM,960,2879,hello this is chef john from
t1BAqsYPReM,2879,4720,foodwishes.com
t1BAqsYPReM,4720,5839,with
t1BAqsYPReM,5839,9120,habanero honey sweet corn cake
t1BAqsYPReM,9120,11679,that's right this was spicy and sweet
t1BAqsYPReM,11679,14920,and savory and dense and moist and very
t1BAqsYPReM,14920,17520,addictive and i had absolutely no idea
t1BAqsYPReM,17520,19920,what to call this i mean it's not really
t1BAqsYPReM,19920,22720,a cake but it's also not a pie or a
t1BAqsYPReM,22720,25680,pudding or a custard so i did end up
t1BAqsYPReM,25680,28160,going with cake since it is inspired by
t1BAqsYPReM,28160,30560,sweet mexican corn cake but no matter
t1BAqsYPReM,30560,33360,what you call this it was phenomenal and
t1BAqsYPReM,33360,34559,to get started the first thing we'll
t1BAqsYPReM,34559,36399,need is a couple cups of sweet corn
t1BAqsYPReM,36399,37520,kernels
t1BAqsYPReM,37520,39600,and to remove those from the cob what i
t1BAqsYPReM,39600,41120,like to do is hold the ear straight up
t1BAqsYPReM,41120,43040,like this in a bowl on top of some kind
t1BAqsYPReM,43040,45680,of ramekin or overturn cup
t1BAqsYPReM,45680,46960,and then all we need to do is take a
t1BAqsYPReM,46960,49600,sharp knife and cut straight down
t1BAqsYPReM,49600,51440,and to me that's a very safe very easy
t1BAqsYPReM,51440,53840,way to get all these kernels off
t1BAqsYPReM,53840,55440,and yes if you want you can use frozen
t1BAqsYPReM,55440,56640,corn for this
t1BAqsYPReM,56640,59760,but if it's available i do prefer fresh
t1BAqsYPReM,59760,61359,but either way once we've measured out
t1BAqsYPReM,61359,63280,two cups we'll go ahead and add one
t1BAqsYPReM,63280,64960,minced habanero
t1BAqsYPReM,64960,66960,which look like this
t1BAqsYPReM,66960,69119,and what we'll do is trim off that stem
t1BAqsYPReM,69119,70400,and then we will cut this open and
t1BAqsYPReM,70400,72880,remove the seeds at which point we'll
t1BAqsYPReM,72880,75040,slice this into nice thin strips and
t1BAqsYPReM,75040,76400,then we'll turn those and slice them
t1BAqsYPReM,76400,79520,across into a fairly fine mince
t1BAqsYPReM,79520,81600,and by the way do me a favor we'll
t1BAqsYPReM,81600,83439,actually do yourself a favor
t1BAqsYPReM,83439,85360,wear some gloves when you do this
t1BAqsYPReM,85360,87439,or use some tongs to hold the pepper
t1BAqsYPReM,87439,88720,since there's a very good chance you
t1BAqsYPReM,88720,91280,will touch your eye or nose or certain
t1BAqsYPReM,91280,93600,areas a little farther south
t1BAqsYPReM,93600,95600,so please be careful
t1BAqsYPReM,95600,98320,and yes a habanero is extremely hot but
t1BAqsYPReM,98320,100400,they are also extremely flavorful and
t1BAqsYPReM,100400,101600,fruity
t1BAqsYPReM,101600,103280,and will pair perfectly with our fresh
t1BAqsYPReM,103280,104720,sweet corn
t1BAqsYPReM,104720,106079,and then once those are set we'll toss
t1BAqsYPReM,106079,107520,them in our bowl
t1BAqsYPReM,107520,110159,followed by two large whole eggs plus a
t1BAqsYPReM,110159,112560,nice splash of cold fresh water although
t1BAqsYPReM,112560,114640,you could also use milk if you want
t1BAqsYPReM,114640,116000,and then we will also want to add a
t1BAqsYPReM,116000,117680,generous amount of honey
t1BAqsYPReM,117680,119360,and if you're using runny honey just go
t1BAqsYPReM,119360,120880,ahead and dump it in
t1BAqsYPReM,120880,121920,but if it's kind of hard and
t1BAqsYPReM,121920,123920,crystallized like mine was we will want
t1BAqsYPReM,123920,125920,to warm that up in a microwave until
t1BAqsYPReM,125920,127439,it's liquefied
t1BAqsYPReM,127439,128959,otherwise it's just going to be too hard
t1BAqsYPReM,128959,130479,to mix in
t1BAqsYPReM,130479,132319,but anyway once that's in there we'll go
t1BAqsYPReM,132319,134720,ahead and blend this almost smooth
t1BAqsYPReM,134720,136160,and for that i'm going to use my stick
t1BAqsYPReM,136160,137120,blender
t1BAqsYPReM,137120,138560,but if you're into washing a regular
t1BAqsYPReM,138560,141280,blender go ahead and use one of those
t1BAqsYPReM,141280,142879,and while we do need enough honey to
t1BAqsYPReM,142879,144720,balance the pepper and make this sweet
t1BAqsYPReM,144720,146959,enough to serve as a dessert we are not
t1BAqsYPReM,146959,148560,using nearly as much sugar as the
t1BAqsYPReM,148560,150720,traditional mexican corn cake which
t1BAqsYPReM,150720,152319,usually includes an entire can of
t1BAqsYPReM,152319,154400,sweetened condensed milk which for me
t1BAqsYPReM,154400,156800,personally is just way too sweet
t1BAqsYPReM,156800,158080,and i'm going to touch more on that at
t1BAqsYPReM,158080,159840,the end of the video
t1BAqsYPReM,159840,162000,and while we do want this pretty smooth
t1BAqsYPReM,162000,164800,it's totally fine if not advantageous to
t1BAqsYPReM,164800,166080,leave the corn with a little bit of
t1BAqsYPReM,166080,167200,texture
t1BAqsYPReM,167200,168640,so like so many other things that's
t1BAqsYPReM,168640,170640,going to be up to you and you can see
t1BAqsYPReM,170640,173040,here how smooth i pureed mine
t1BAqsYPReM,173040,174400,and that's it we can go ahead and lose
t1BAqsYPReM,174400,176480,the blender and toss in the rest of the
t1BAqsYPReM,176480,178400,ingredients including a whole bunch of
t1BAqsYPReM,178400,180000,melted butter
t1BAqsYPReM,180000,181920,plus some cornmeal
t1BAqsYPReM,181920,184560,some all-purpose flour some baking
t1BAqsYPReM,184560,185599,powder
t1BAqsYPReM,185599,188560,no not baking soda baking powder
t1BAqsYPReM,188560,190000,and then last but not least a nice big
t1BAqsYPReM,190000,191440,pinch of salt
t1BAqsYPReM,191440,192800,and that's it we'll grab a whisk and
t1BAqsYPReM,192800,194640,stir all this together
t1BAqsYPReM,194640,196640,but do not over mix
t1BAqsYPReM,196640,198080,not that it will have any effect on the
t1BAqsYPReM,198080,200640,final product it really won't
t1BAqsYPReM,200640,202560,but once something's mixed why would you
t1BAqsYPReM,202560,203840,keep mixing
t1BAqsYPReM,203840,205360,i mean at that point you're just wasting
t1BAqsYPReM,205360,207120,time and we probably have other things
t1BAqsYPReM,207120,208159,to do
t1BAqsYPReM,208159,209840,so as soon as everything's incorporated
t1BAqsYPReM,209840,211200,we will stop
t1BAqsYPReM,211200,212560,and we will transfer that into a
t1BAqsYPReM,212560,214959,standard pie dish that's been generously
t1BAqsYPReM,214959,216319,buttered
t1BAqsYPReM,216319,217840,with butter
t1BAqsYPReM,217840,219360,and once everything's been transferred
t1BAqsYPReM,219360,221599,in we'll go ahead and give that the old
t1BAqsYPReM,221599,223440,sheikah shaker to kind of settle
t1BAqsYPReM,223440,224799,everything down
t1BAqsYPReM,224799,226959,but do not give it the old tapatapa
t1BAqsYPReM,226959,228959,unless you put a towel down because the
t1BAqsYPReM,228959,230319,dish will break and you'll have a big
t1BAqsYPReM,230319,231360,mess
t1BAqsYPReM,231360,232879,and that's it this is now ready to
t1BAqsYPReM,232879,235840,transfer into the center of a 350 degree
t1BAqsYPReM,235840,239120,oven for about 45 to 55 minutes
t1BAqsYPReM,239120,241280,or until our sweet corn cake looks like
t1BAqsYPReM,241280,242319,this
t1BAqsYPReM,242319,243760,and the top surface should be a nice
t1BAqsYPReM,243760,245280,golden brown
t1BAqsYPReM,245280,247200,so yes that looks done
t1BAqsYPReM,247200,249519,but looks done and is done are often two
t1BAqsYPReM,249519,250879,different things
t1BAqsYPReM,250879,252159,so we'll go ahead and test this with a
t1BAqsYPReM,252159,254159,wooden skewer which should come out
t1BAqsYPReM,254159,255120,clean
t1BAqsYPReM,255120,256639,and this did
t1BAqsYPReM,256639,259120,and now we know for sure we're done
t1BAqsYPReM,259120,260320,and then i guess you could serve this
t1BAqsYPReM,260320,262400,hot if you have to but you probably
t1BAqsYPReM,262400,263520,don't have to
t1BAqsYPReM,263520,265360,so i think we should let this cool down
t1BAqsYPReM,265360,268240,to just barely warm or room temp before
t1BAqsYPReM,268240,270720,we go ahead and cut a slice and serve up
t1BAqsYPReM,270720,272240,and i guess if we wanted we could paint
t1BAqsYPReM,272240,274160,some honey on the top to kind of shine
t1BAqsYPReM,274160,275600,up that surface
t1BAqsYPReM,275600,277520,but of course that's up to you
t1BAqsYPReM,277520,278800,i mean you are after all the snake
t1BAqsYPReM,278800,281040,pliskins of whether your corn cake
t1BAqsYPReM,281040,283600,listens but i think it looks beautiful
t1BAqsYPReM,283600,285040,as is
t1BAqsYPReM,285040,286720,and yes that first piece can always be a
t1BAqsYPReM,286720,288800,challenge to get it out nice and clean
t1BAqsYPReM,288800,290560,but this wedge came out surprisingly
t1BAqsYPReM,290560,291600,nice
t1BAqsYPReM,291600,293680,and then as far as garnishes go
t1BAqsYPReM,293680,295360,i think some fresh fruit like strawberry
t1BAqsYPReM,295360,296639,would be perfect
t1BAqsYPReM,296639,298639,so i fanned one of those
t1BAqsYPReM,298639,300000,which i thought would look really nice
t1BAqsYPReM,300000,302800,in the contractually obligated pictures
t1BAqsYPReM,302800,304880,and then for a couple final touches i'm
t1BAqsYPReM,304880,306080,gonna go ahead and put a spoon of creme
t1BAqsYPReM,306080,308240,fraiche on top but you could also use
t1BAqsYPReM,308240,310560,sour cream or what we really should be
t1BAqsYPReM,310560,312880,using here is mexican crema which is
t1BAqsYPReM,312880,315120,very similar to creme fraiche or just
t1BAqsYPReM,315120,316880,whipped cream but i think a little bit
t1BAqsYPReM,316880,318479,of acidity here really does bring out
t1BAqsYPReM,318479,319919,the other flavors
t1BAqsYPReM,319919,321360,and then last but not least we will hit
t1BAqsYPReM,321360,322880,this with a little bit of freshly grated
t1BAqsYPReM,322880,325440,lime zest since of course lime and corn
t1BAqsYPReM,325440,327680,are never not great together
t1BAqsYPReM,327680,329440,and that's it our habanero and honey
t1BAqsYPReM,329440,332479,sweet corn cake was ready to enjoy
t1BAqsYPReM,332479,334080,and that my friends was just sweet
t1BAqsYPReM,334080,335919,summer corn perfection
t1BAqsYPReM,335919,338639,and i like sweet but i love sweet with
t1BAqsYPReM,338639,339600,heat
t1BAqsYPReM,339600,341199,and even though we only used one small
t1BAqsYPReM,341199,344000,pepper this was pretty spicy but the
t1BAqsYPReM,344000,346160,good news is some tea sweet will kind of
t1BAqsYPReM,346160,347759,cancel out the heat
t1BAqsYPReM,347759,349199,so as you eat this that he kind of
t1BAqsYPReM,349199,351120,builds up from the habanero
t1BAqsYPReM,351120,353039,at the beginning of the bite but then
t1BAqsYPReM,353039,354479,about halfway through the sweetness from
t1BAqsYPReM,354479,356720,the honey kind of cools everything down
t1BAqsYPReM,356720,358240,and it really is quite the culinary
t1BAqsYPReM,358240,359680,roller coaster
t1BAqsYPReM,359680,361680,oh and regarding the sweetness as i
t1BAqsYPReM,361680,363919,mentioned traditionally a mexican style
t1BAqsYPReM,363919,365280,corn cake is made with sweetened
t1BAqsYPReM,365280,366479,condensed milk
t1BAqsYPReM,366479,367840,which for me produces something that's
t1BAqsYPReM,367840,370560,just a little too sweet for my taste
t1BAqsYPReM,370560,372479,but i have a theory that when that
t1BAqsYPReM,372479,374319,recipe was originated
t1BAqsYPReM,374319,376240,the corn used in it was not nearly as
t1BAqsYPReM,376240,377520,sweet as what we have today in the
t1BAqsYPReM,377520,380160,market as it was very very starchy and
t1BAqsYPReM,380160,381520,barely sweet
t1BAqsYPReM,381520,383039,and in that case all that sugar would
t1BAqsYPReM,383039,384400,make sense
t1BAqsYPReM,384400,385919,but here we've combined that natural
t1BAqsYPReM,385919,388160,sweetness of the corn with a relatively
t1BAqsYPReM,388160,390240,modest amount of honey and i think we've
t1BAqsYPReM,390240,392160,achieved a perfect level of sweetness to
t1BAqsYPReM,392160,394319,balance the heat from that pepper so
t1BAqsYPReM,394319,396000,taste wise i just loved absolutely
t1BAqsYPReM,396000,397919,everything about this
t1BAqsYPReM,397919,400000,oh and in the spirit of full disclosure
t1BAqsYPReM,400000,401919,i had another piece later
t1BAqsYPReM,401919,404160,well actually several pieces later after
t1BAqsYPReM,404160,406400,this had been refrigerated and without a
t1BAqsYPReM,406400,408560,doubt cold is my favorite temperature to
t1BAqsYPReM,408560,409840,eat this at
t1BAqsYPReM,409840,411840,and when it is cold and i know this is
t1BAqsYPReM,411840,413520,going to sound kind of crazy
t1BAqsYPReM,413520,415520,but it has a mouth feel and texture very
t1BAqsYPReM,415520,417520,similar to cheesecake
t1BAqsYPReM,417520,419120,which is very odd since there's no
t1BAqsYPReM,419120,420400,cheese in this
t1BAqsYPReM,420400,422160,but that really is what it reminded me
t1BAqsYPReM,422160,423039,of
t1BAqsYPReM,423039,425840,a spicy corn flavored cheesecake
t1BAqsYPReM,425840,427120,so maybe that's what i should have
t1BAqsYPReM,427120,428240,called this
t1BAqsYPReM,428240,429360,or not
t1BAqsYPReM,429360,431280,but like i said in the intro no matter
t1BAqsYPReM,431280,434080,what you call this it is truly unique
t1BAqsYPReM,434080,437039,and incredibly delicious which is why i
t1BAqsYPReM,437039,440000,really do hope you give this a try soon
t1BAqsYPReM,440000,441759,so please follow the links below for the
t1BAqsYPReM,441759,444000,ingredient amounts a printable written
t1BAqsYPReM,444000,446800,recipe and much more info as usual
t1BAqsYPReM,446800,449120,and as always
t1BAqsYPReM,449120,451840,enjoy
t1BAqsYPReM,470240,472319,you
