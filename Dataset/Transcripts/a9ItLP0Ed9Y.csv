a9ItLP0Ed9Y,80,2080,here are my top three tips for drawing
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,2080,4080,with colored pencils i'm a colored
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,4080,5680,pencil artist and this is one of my
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,5680,7759,drawings my first tip is whenever you're
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,7759,9920,blending two colors together always add
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,9920,11920,a middle shade doesn't seem like that
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,11920,13360,big of a deal until you see the
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,13360,15120,difference it makes it look way more
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,15120,17760,saturated the next tip is never color
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,17760,20160,with straight lines always use tiny tiny
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,20160,22160,circles this will make sure that your
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,22160,24480,drawing looks seamless and smooth
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,24480,25920,whereas if you're coloring back and
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,25920,27760,forth with your pencil like most people
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,27760,29359,do that's when you're going to get those
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,29359,30960,harsh lines and it's going to look
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,30960,33200,unblended and messy the last tip i have
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,33200,34800,is make sure you build up your colors
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,34800,36640,slowly and use really light pencil
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,36640,38640,strokes you can always add more color
a9ItLP0Ed9Y,38640,42800,but it's much harder to take it away
