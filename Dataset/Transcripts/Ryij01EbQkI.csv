Ryij01EbQkI,230,3040,"- Hi, I'm Joey Santore, plant lover, botanist,"
Ryij01EbQkI,3040,4390,and working class mook.
Ryij01EbQkI,4390,7580,Today I'm here to answer your plant questions via Twitter.
Ryij01EbQkI,7580,9228,This is Plant Support.
Ryij01EbQkI,9228,11811,[upbeat music]
Ryij01EbQkI,13600,15943,"Okay, this one's from CashSmartLLC."
Ryij01EbQkI,16950,19237,Maybe this guy could do my taxes when we're done.
Ryij01EbQkI,19237,22577,"""Is it possible for humans to have a symbiotic relationship"
Ryij01EbQkI,22577,23710,"""with a plant species?"""
Ryij01EbQkI,23710,24869,It happens all the time.
Ryij01EbQkI,24870,27720,"You know, there are plants who have had enormous increases"
Ryij01EbQkI,27720,29980,in their distribution due to human beings.
Ryij01EbQkI,29980,31859,Cannabis is a great example of that.
Ryij01EbQkI,31860,34890,Cannabis now occurs on every continent except Antarctica.
Ryij01EbQkI,34890,37829,"That's a great example of humans taking a plant,"
Ryij01EbQkI,37830,42370,"increasing its range, increasing its genetic diversity,"
Ryij01EbQkI,42370,45510,"many domestic crop species, many of the plants we eat,"
Ryij01EbQkI,45510,48500,and even invasive weeds that tend to thrive
Ryij01EbQkI,48500,50180,in areas of human disturbance.
Ryij01EbQkI,50180,51390,A great example of that would be
Ryij01EbQkI,51390,54170,"something like tree of heaven, Ailanthus altissima."
Ryij01EbQkI,54170,55620,Really thrives in our cities.
Ryij01EbQkI,55620,56950,It can tolerate pollution.
Ryij01EbQkI,56950,58260,It can tolerate drought.
Ryij01EbQkI,58260,60629,It can tolerate growing outta concrete.
Ryij01EbQkI,60630,61860,And it spreads by rhizomes.
Ryij01EbQkI,61860,63320,So that's a great example.
Ryij01EbQkI,63320,66400,The tree of heaven has benefited extensively
Ryij01EbQkI,66400,69970,from its association with human society.
Ryij01EbQkI,69970,72857,"Okay, this one's from dylancholy."
Ryij01EbQkI,72857,74670,"""How the [beep] does mulch work?"""
Ryij01EbQkI,74670,76360,"If I was a smart ass I would just say, you know,"
Ryij01EbQkI,76360,79320,you get a couple guys throwing logs in a wood chipper
Ryij01EbQkI,79320,80930,and then out comes all the wood chips.
Ryij01EbQkI,80930,84240,"But the benefit of mulch, like why you throw it in a garden,"
Ryij01EbQkI,84240,87290,is because not only does it protect that barren soil
Ryij01EbQkI,87290,88850,"from transpiration of water,"
Ryij01EbQkI,88850,90250,from losing all its moisture
Ryij01EbQkI,90250,92010,"from getting heated up by the sun,"
Ryij01EbQkI,92010,95430,"but also once it rains and that mulch gets some moisture,"
Ryij01EbQkI,95430,97240,fungi and microbes break it down
Ryij01EbQkI,97240,100369,and then add a bounty of nutrients to the soil
Ryij01EbQkI,100370,102870,that is then accessible to all the plants that grow in it.
Ryij01EbQkI,102870,105720,"So it helps retain moisture, it adds nutrients,"
Ryij01EbQkI,105720,108930,and also it keeps other weeds down that might compete
Ryij01EbQkI,108930,111530,with the plants that you want to have in that garden.
Ryij01EbQkI,111530,113826,This one from a typhoonannie.
Ryij01EbQkI,113827,117143,"""How TF can you overwater a plant, like?"
Ryij01EbQkI,117987,119710,"""Just don't drink it, little dude."""
Ryij01EbQkI,119710,121890,"Well, typhoonannie, it doesn't really work like that."
Ryij01EbQkI,121890,124090,"See, a lot of plants, depending on where they grow,"
Ryij01EbQkI,124090,126500,"and cacti are a great example of this,"
Ryij01EbQkI,126500,129039,their roots soak up water like a dry sponge.
Ryij01EbQkI,129039,131310,Now this works for them because where they grow
Ryij01EbQkI,131310,134650,it's often very dry and it's often very hot.
Ryij01EbQkI,134650,137260,"So when moisture does seep into that soil,"
Ryij01EbQkI,137260,139760,it evaporates pretty quickly due to the heat.
Ryij01EbQkI,139760,141730,"You know, you water a cactus in the winter,"
Ryij01EbQkI,141730,144400,"it's gonna sit in that soil for, you know,"
Ryij01EbQkI,144400,146659,upwards of a few days before it evaporates.
Ryij01EbQkI,146660,150360,And in doing so it's only able to soak up so much
Ryij01EbQkI,150360,152420,based on the metabolism that it's got.
Ryij01EbQkI,152420,153680,"The metabolic rate, of course,"
Ryij01EbQkI,153680,154900,is dependent on the temperature.
Ryij01EbQkI,154900,157670,"So if it's too chilly, it's just gonna sit in that water"
Ryij01EbQkI,157670,159860,"and it can't access the water, it's already full,"
Ryij01EbQkI,159860,162100,and at that point it begins to rot.
Ryij01EbQkI,162100,164807,This one's from melissa_aileen.
Ryij01EbQkI,164807,167207,"""WTF is an orchid?"
Ryij01EbQkI,167207,169087,"""The word doesn't sit right with me."
Ryij01EbQkI,169087,172570,"""Orchid. Sounds like a lot of hoopla, drunk Mel."""
Ryij01EbQkI,172570,174680,"Okay, well, although I am against drunk tweeting,"
Ryij01EbQkI,174680,176250,I do have to agree with you.
Ryij01EbQkI,176250,178170,The word doesn't sit right with you
Ryij01EbQkI,178170,180790,because it's the Greek word for testicle.
Ryij01EbQkI,180790,184310,"The reason the Greeks named orchids after orchis,"
Ryij01EbQkI,184310,186660,"the Greek word for testicle, is because in Europe"
Ryij01EbQkI,186660,188130,most of the terrestrial orchids
Ryij01EbQkI,188130,191170,do indeed have a little tuber that kinda looks like a nut.
Ryij01EbQkI,191170,192870,This one's coming from @jaxonrice.
Ryij01EbQkI,193805,196920,"""Do you have any idea how long it takes to grow peyote?"""
Ryij01EbQkI,196920,198660,And here's a nice picture we've provided
Ryij01EbQkI,198660,202180,with the beautiful pink flower of Lophophora williamsii.
Ryij01EbQkI,202180,205099,How peyote grows in cultivation is entirely dependent
Ryij01EbQkI,205100,207250,on the warmth that's provided for it.
Ryij01EbQkI,207250,208950,"You get a little seeding heat mat,"
Ryij01EbQkI,208950,210470,you get the plant's metabolism going.
Ryij01EbQkI,210470,212880,"Remember, plant metabolism's entirely dependent"
Ryij01EbQkI,212880,213940,on temperature almost.
Ryij01EbQkI,213940,216660,"You have the right kind of warmth, you got the right soil,"
Ryij01EbQkI,216660,220250,"you know, you can grow a seed to a golf ball size"
Ryij01EbQkI,220250,222340,little button in upwards of four or five years.
Ryij01EbQkI,222340,224000,"Now Jaxon, I have a feeling"
Ryij01EbQkI,224000,225920,as to why you're asking this question
Ryij01EbQkI,225920,227920,"and, you know, it probably has something to do"
Ryij01EbQkI,227920,230740,"with ingesting this plant, and I don't blame you."
Ryij01EbQkI,230740,232080,"Maybe you wanna have a vision quest,"
Ryij01EbQkI,232080,234530,"you know, you wanna have a little insight into yourself."
Ryij01EbQkI,234530,236720,"I would tell you there's probably easier ways to do it,"
Ryij01EbQkI,236720,238810,"'cause these plants take a long time to grow,"
Ryij01EbQkI,238810,241239,and you get gotta eat at least four or five of them
Ryij01EbQkI,241240,242200,to get any effects.
Ryij01EbQkI,242200,244500,So would you really wanna do that to a plant
Ryij01EbQkI,244500,246210,that took you five years to grow?
Ryij01EbQkI,246210,250150,"This is from alxgirar, Alex with no E,"
Ryij01EbQkI,250150,251786,if that makes any sense.
Ryij01EbQkI,251787,254617,"""Anthro prof assigned us a plant taxonomy."
Ryij01EbQkI,254617,257130,"""WTF even is that?"""
Ryij01EbQkI,257130,258989,"That's one of my favorite subjects, actually."
Ryij01EbQkI,258989,263440,"Plant taxonomy is the study of classifying organisms,"
Ryij01EbQkI,263440,265810,and it might seem like it's a bunch of Latin names
Ryij01EbQkI,265810,267567,"that some dead European white guys made up,"
Ryij01EbQkI,267567,269349,"you know, 300 years ago."
Ryij01EbQkI,269350,271330,What the [beep] does this matter now?
Ryij01EbQkI,271330,273280,"But actually, it's a pretty beautiful system"
Ryij01EbQkI,273280,275687,to organize things according to how they evolve.
Ryij01EbQkI,275687,277410,"And if you start to grasp this,"
Ryij01EbQkI,277410,279720,you can grasp how everything is related.
Ryij01EbQkI,279720,282240,"Now, a good example of binomial nomenclature,"
Ryij01EbQkI,282240,284509,and every binomial name has genus and species.
Ryij01EbQkI,284510,287580,Homo sapiens would be a great example of this.
Ryij01EbQkI,287580,290199,A good botanical example is this guy right here.
Ryij01EbQkI,290200,292900,"This is Cleistocactus colademononis,"
Ryij01EbQkI,292900,295160,and it used to be in the genus Hildewintera
Ryij01EbQkI,295160,297680,until DNA sequencing was done on it.
Ryij01EbQkI,297680,299667,"Botanists realized that it was actually,"
Ryij01EbQkI,299667,302210,it shared the same DNA sequences
Ryij01EbQkI,302210,305639,as a genus that already existed called Cleistocactus.
Ryij01EbQkI,305640,307190,So Cleistocactus colademononis.
Ryij01EbQkI,308610,311060,"Now you could also go by the common name Monkey's Tail,"
Ryij01EbQkI,311060,314070,but there's probably quite a few other cacti
Ryij01EbQkI,314070,315920,that go by the common name Monkey's Tail.
Ryij01EbQkI,315920,318280,"So if you call it Monkey's Tail,"
Ryij01EbQkI,318280,320350,"it's kind of hard to know which one you're talking about,"
Ryij01EbQkI,320350,322410,if you're looking for specificity.
Ryij01EbQkI,322410,324837,This one is from a UKEdVideo.
Ryij01EbQkI,324837,327050,"""What's the strangest plant in the world?"""
Ryij01EbQkI,327050,329569,"That's a good question, and I have to give it to a plant"
Ryij01EbQkI,329570,331150,called Welwitschia mirabilis
Ryij01EbQkI,331150,333210,that grows in the fog deserts of Namibia.
Ryij01EbQkI,333210,335093,"Now, it's a very old lineage of plant."
Ryij01EbQkI,335093,338689,It's so old that fossils of it occur in South America.
Ryij01EbQkI,338690,340420,"Before all that tectonic action,"
Ryij01EbQkI,340420,342710,"that hot tectonic action, split them apart"
Ryij01EbQkI,342710,344030,and created the Atlantic Ocean.
Ryij01EbQkI,344030,345600,"So this is an old lineage of plant,"
Ryij01EbQkI,345600,347890,but it's a [beep] bizarre looking weirdo too.
Ryij01EbQkI,347890,350080,"It can live for 1,000 or 2,000 years."
Ryij01EbQkI,350080,352939,It's more closely related to conifers like redwoods
Ryij01EbQkI,352940,355150,"than it is to flowering plants,"
Ryij01EbQkI,355150,356610,of course which evolved later.
Ryij01EbQkI,356610,359539,And it has the same two leaves throughout its entire lives.
Ryij01EbQkI,359540,362040,"They grow in very barren, dry areas,"
Ryij01EbQkI,362040,364750,and most of their moisture does indeed come from fog
Ryij01EbQkI,364750,367220,off those cold ocean currents to the west.
Ryij01EbQkI,367220,369917,"All right, this one's coming from ikaari."
Ryij01EbQkI,369917,371957,"""Mushrooms are an example as something I hate"
Ryij01EbQkI,371957,374187,"""because I don't understand, LOL."
Ryij01EbQkI,374187,375527,"""Like, how do they grow?"
Ryij01EbQkI,375527,377157,"""How are they so resilient?"
Ryij01EbQkI,377157,378450,"""Why do we eat fungi?"""
Ryij01EbQkI,378450,379910,This shit will really weird you out.
Ryij01EbQkI,379910,382410,Fungi are actually more closely related to us
Ryij01EbQkI,382410,383337,than they are to plants.
Ryij01EbQkI,383337,386840,You go far enough back in the tree of life
Ryij01EbQkI,386840,388630,you'll see that it branched off
Ryij01EbQkI,388630,391140,"within the last billion years, but pretty far back."
Ryij01EbQkI,391140,394050,"What you see when you see in mushroom is just, in essence,"
Ryij01EbQkI,394050,395340,the fruit of the fungus.
Ryij01EbQkI,395340,398210,It doesn't hurt the fungus itself to pick the mushroom.
Ryij01EbQkI,398210,399830,"If you could anthropomorphize,"
Ryij01EbQkI,399830,402830,a lot of fungi would prefer to have their mushrooms picked
Ryij01EbQkI,402830,403729,because that's how they end up
Ryij01EbQkI,403730,405090,dispersing their spores around.
Ryij01EbQkI,405090,407590,"But the fungus itself, the living organism,"
Ryij01EbQkI,407590,409040,actually consists of these things
Ryij01EbQkI,409040,411900,"called mycelial strands, a mycelium."
Ryij01EbQkI,411900,413680,Looks like this white webby material
Ryij01EbQkI,413680,415870,"that basically spreads into a substrate,"
Ryij01EbQkI,415870,417889,"whether it's a rotting log or the soil,"
Ryij01EbQkI,417890,419420,and looks for things to eat.
Ryij01EbQkI,419420,421760,And the way it eats them is by secreting enzymes
Ryij01EbQkI,421760,425290,"that in effect break down cellulose or lignin,"
Ryij01EbQkI,425290,427280,"or in some cases human tissue,"
Ryij01EbQkI,427280,429600,to extract nutrients from them.
Ryij01EbQkI,429600,432667,And this one's from BotanyRNG.
Ryij01EbQkI,432667,434440,"""What's your most interesting plant fact?"""
Ryij01EbQkI,434440,437350,"For me, what got me really excited about learning this"
Ryij01EbQkI,437350,441600,"when I first did was that geology, in some cases,"
Ryij01EbQkI,441600,443210,directly affects plant growth.
Ryij01EbQkI,443210,445169,You get certain plants that occur
Ryij01EbQkI,445170,447060,"only on a certain type of rock,"
Ryij01EbQkI,447060,449660,"you know, whether you get gypsum in the Chihuahuan Desert,"
Ryij01EbQkI,449660,452850,"or a limestone, or in California a very odd"
Ryij01EbQkI,452850,454350,and somewhat toxic rock
Ryij01EbQkI,454350,457600,that sometimes contains asbestos called serpentinite.
Ryij01EbQkI,457600,461180,There are plants that only grow on that type of substrate.
Ryij01EbQkI,461180,463150,You won't find them growing anywhere else.
Ryij01EbQkI,463150,465440,They need the gypsum or they need the serpentine
Ryij01EbQkI,465440,466657,or they need the limestone.
Ryij01EbQkI,466657,470360,And a great example of that is a plant called funeral sage.
Ryij01EbQkI,470360,473240,"You'll never find funeral sage growing anywhere else,"
Ryij01EbQkI,473240,474729,except on limestone
Ryij01EbQkI,474730,476840,where there's often almost no soil at all.
Ryij01EbQkI,476840,479630,It's just growing straight out of the porous limestone rock
Ryij01EbQkI,479630,481880,and it produces very small purple flowers
Ryij01EbQkI,481880,484780,and the leaves are so covered in wool and fuzz
Ryij01EbQkI,484780,486750,that they look like pointy Q-tips.
Ryij01EbQkI,486750,488967,"All right, this one's from CathyCasilda."
Ryij01EbQkI,488967,491507,"""I learned that Joshua trees are naturally spread"

Ryij01EbQkI,498667,500537,"""Is that true? Did I really hear that?"""
Ryij01EbQkI,500537,501690,That's kind of iffy.
Ryij01EbQkI,501690,504040,"There was a paper that came out talking about this,"
Ryij01EbQkI,504040,506470,about how Joshua tree seeds were found
Ryij01EbQkI,506470,508530,in giant slot scat in a cave.
Ryij01EbQkI,508530,510420,"Obviously, Joshua trees are still around"
Ryij01EbQkI,510420,513150,"and giant slots aren't, so something's going on here."
Ryij01EbQkI,513150,514849,Some other animal's dispersing the seed.
Ryij01EbQkI,514849,518310,Turns out the animal that's most responsible at present
Ryij01EbQkI,518310,520710,"for dispersing Joshua tree seeds,"
Ryij01EbQkI,520710,522599,"which just look like little black flakes,"
Ryij01EbQkI,522599,524990,"kind of like agave seeds, are rodents."
Ryij01EbQkI,524990,527170,"So there's rodents that will take these fruits,"
Ryij01EbQkI,527170,529839,"bring them back to their little dens and homes,"
Ryij01EbQkI,529840,532510,"crack the fruits open, and then cache the seeds,"
Ryij01EbQkI,532510,533343,kind of stash them.
Ryij01EbQkI,533343,535620,'Cause they bury them like a centimeter under the soil.
Ryij01EbQkI,535620,537150,But the thing is they don't remember
Ryij01EbQkI,537150,538100,where they put all of them.
Ryij01EbQkI,538100,540610,So they forget sometimes and those end up germinating
Ryij01EbQkI,540610,543100,and turning into new Joshua trees.
Ryij01EbQkI,543100,545990,"At one point, the giants slot were probably doing"
Ryij01EbQkI,545990,547089,a lot of the dispersing.

Ryij01EbQkI,561430,564710,Now an ovary is just a kind of a vessel for the seeds
Ryij01EbQkI,564710,567320,and it's what differentiates flowering plants
Ryij01EbQkI,567320,570450,from other plants like ferns and mosses and conifers.
Ryij01EbQkI,570450,573960,"Ovaries are part of the compound sexual part,"

Ryij01EbQkI,578620,580700,"Now I know, kind of counterintuitive."
Ryij01EbQkI,580700,581980,"So you've got the ovary,"
Ryij01EbQkI,581980,584510,"which is at the base of that pistil,"
Ryij01EbQkI,584510,586830,"and then you've got the style,"
Ryij01EbQkI,586830,589040,"which is the stalk that holds up the stigma,"
Ryij01EbQkI,589040,590620,and the stigma's where the pollen lands.
Ryij01EbQkI,590620,593920,"So from the top down, it goes stigma, style, ovary,"
Ryij01EbQkI,593920,595300,ovary being at the bottom.

Ryij01EbQkI,618760,621500,Kudzu is a member of a pea family Fabaceae

Ryij01EbQkI,627520,629840,It thrives in the American Southeast

Ryij01EbQkI,637030,638770,Kudzu's almost at the top of the food chain.

Ryij01EbQkI,650750,651670,Just let it grow.
Ryij01EbQkI,651670,653209,But unfortunately it doesn't work like that.
Ryij01EbQkI,653210,654520,No species is an island.
Ryij01EbQkI,654520,656880,Species are members of things called ecosystems

Ryij01EbQkI,658410,659360,"for millions of years,"
Ryij01EbQkI,659360,662410,developing a relationship with all the insects and fungi
Ryij01EbQkI,662410,664490,and other plants and animals in that ecosystem.
Ryij01EbQkI,664490,666810,And when you take a plant out of one ecosystem

Ryij01EbQkI,733530,736190,and flavonoids which cause the yellow and the orange color.
Ryij01EbQkI,736190,738050,Now as the winter approaches
Ryij01EbQkI,738050,739910,and the daylight hours decrease
Ryij01EbQkI,739910,741480,"and the temperature decreases,"

Ryij01EbQkI,749660,750850,"At the same time,"

Ryij01EbQkI,1093930,1096480,Another good way to tell if a plant is poisonous
Ryij01EbQkI,1096480,1098410,"is to know, for instance, that most members"

Ryij01EbQkI,1101270,1103830,"the Apocynaceae, tend to contain heart toxins"
Ryij01EbQkI,1103830,1105279,called cardiac leukocytes.
Ryij01EbQkI,1105280,1106787,So if you find a plant
Ryij01EbQkI,1106787,1109370,and you know just from looking at the flower

Ryij01EbQkI,1120380,1122180,of the nightshade family will produce fruits
Ryij01EbQkI,1122180,1123060,that aren't poisonous.
Ryij01EbQkI,1123060,1127040,"But to make it even more confusing, some of those species,"
Ryij01EbQkI,1127040,1128810,"even in the same genus, will produce fruits"
Ryij01EbQkI,1128810,1129643,that are poisonous.
Ryij01EbQkI,1129643,1132200,"So the same genus will produce fruits that aren't poisonous,"
Ryij01EbQkI,1132200,1134450,"like tomatoes in the genus Solanum,"
Ryij01EbQkI,1134450,1137679,"and it will also produce fruits like deadly nightshade,"

Ryij01EbQkI,1554970,1557590,And that plant's light is all coming from one side.
Ryij01EbQkI,1557590,1558447,So there's an entire side of the plant
Ryij01EbQkI,1558447,1560190,that's not getting any light at all.
Ryij01EbQkI,1560190,1561909,"All right, well, that's all I got time for today."
Ryij01EbQkI,1561910,1563140,Hopefully you learned something.
Ryij01EbQkI,1563140,1565220,"Pay attention, look around your environment,"
Ryij01EbQkI,1565220,1566053,ask some questions.
Ryij01EbQkI,1566053,1566886,That's all I got.
