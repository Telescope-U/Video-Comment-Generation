IUwqf08-FKU,6050,7871,"This is ""Vet Support."""

IUwqf08-FKU,12573,14537,"@dontforgetchaos asks,"
IUwqf08-FKU,14537,16219,"""Why don't we keep squirrels as pets?"
IUwqf08-FKU,16219,18509,"We keep rats, rabbits, mice, et cetera."
IUwqf08-FKU,18510,20450,"Why not squirrels? I'd like a pet squirrel."""
IUwqf08-FKU,20450,22920,"No, you wouldn't. Squirrels do not make good pets."
IUwqf08-FKU,22920,24090,They are destructive.
IUwqf08-FKU,24090,26740,They have teeth and claws and they will chew things up.
IUwqf08-FKU,26740,28690,Squirrels are not social animals.
IUwqf08-FKU,28690,30510,"In fact, they will turn on people,"
IUwqf08-FKU,30510,33010,including handlers who have raised them from babies.
IUwqf08-FKU,33010,35000,"And number three, squirrels are not able"
IUwqf08-FKU,35000,36660,to be litter-trained or trained

IUwqf08-FKU,49810,52340,"If you own a cat, you've certainly seen them grooming."
IUwqf08-FKU,52340,55540,"They spend hours of their day, quite literally,"
IUwqf08-FKU,55540,58080,grooming themselves by licking the fur.
IUwqf08-FKU,58080,59620,"That takes the loose hair,"
IUwqf08-FKU,59620,62140,and oftentimes they tend to swallow that.
IUwqf08-FKU,62140,63620,"And rather than digest it,"
IUwqf08-FKU,63620,68200,the cat's GI system enables them to gather that hair up
IUwqf08-FKU,68200,69729,and regurgitate it.
IUwqf08-FKU,69730,71760,So they do spit it back up.
IUwqf08-FKU,71760,74120,And that ends up being the nice hairball
IUwqf08-FKU,74120,76720,that we find probably on our nice carpet.
IUwqf08-FKU,76720,78690,And that is just the nature of cats.
IUwqf08-FKU,78690,81937,"So @loremercad asks,"
IUwqf08-FKU,81937,85090,"""What causes obesity in cats and dogs?"""
IUwqf08-FKU,85090,86399,It's when the calories
IUwqf08-FKU,86400,91210,that they consume exceed the calories that they burn.
IUwqf08-FKU,91210,93080,So it's a mismatch in how much we feed them
IUwqf08-FKU,93080,94530,and how much activity they get
IUwqf08-FKU,94530,95880,because we control that.
IUwqf08-FKU,95880,96799,And then let's make sure
IUwqf08-FKU,96800,98540,"that they get lots of exercise, as well."
IUwqf08-FKU,98540,99950,Because it's good for all of us.
IUwqf08-FKU,99950,103297,"All right, @xxuemei asks,"
IUwqf08-FKU,103297,108297,"""Why my sugar glider have so many problems?"" Crying face."
IUwqf08-FKU,108380,111030,"Sugar gliders, you know, they are an exotic animal."
IUwqf08-FKU,111030,112960,They have some husbandry challenges.
IUwqf08-FKU,112960,114580,They require a unique environment.
IUwqf08-FKU,114580,115630,So that's number one.
IUwqf08-FKU,115630,117170,Here's another big thing about them.
IUwqf08-FKU,117170,119280,"You know, sugar gliders glide."
IUwqf08-FKU,119280,121900,"Therefore, they love playing,"
IUwqf08-FKU,121900,123750,and you've gotta have a safe enclosure
IUwqf08-FKU,123750,126200,"or space for them to play because otherwise,"
IUwqf08-FKU,126200,127770,one of the most common things that happens
IUwqf08-FKU,127770,129950,with sugar gliders is trauma.
IUwqf08-FKU,129950,133560,They glide into a curtain and they break a leg
IUwqf08-FKU,133560,134750,or they get strangled.
IUwqf08-FKU,134750,136830,"They end up somewhere they're not supposed to be,"
IUwqf08-FKU,136830,139370,"and they get stuck, they get scratched, they get hurt."
IUwqf08-FKU,139370,140560,So you've gotta make sure you've got
IUwqf08-FKU,140560,142400,a safe place for your sugar glider.
IUwqf08-FKU,142400,143232,The other piece
IUwqf08-FKU,143233,145650,is they're pretty sensitive little critters.
IUwqf08-FKU,145650,148180,They can dehydrate in a matter of hours
IUwqf08-FKU,148180,150200,if they don't have access to enough water.
IUwqf08-FKU,150200,153040,They're also very susceptible to toxins.
IUwqf08-FKU,153040,155680,And so they eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.
IUwqf08-FKU,155680,157530,And if you don't clean what you buy
IUwqf08-FKU,157530,158930,"from the store well enough,"
IUwqf08-FKU,158930,161299,you can actually poison your sugar glider
IUwqf08-FKU,161300,163300,by giving them food that's contaminated
IUwqf08-FKU,163300,165400,at levels that wouldn't impact you or I
IUwqf08-FKU,165400,167360,but that do impact the sugar glider.
IUwqf08-FKU,167360,168240,"So at the end of the day,"
IUwqf08-FKU,168240,169750,"if you're gonna have a sugar glider,"
IUwqf08-FKU,169750,171600,"you gotta make sure you know what you're getting into,"
IUwqf08-FKU,171600,173290,and you gotta make sure you partner
IUwqf08-FKU,173290,175439,with a veterinarian who can help you make sure
IUwqf08-FKU,175440,176930,you're providing that sugar glider
IUwqf08-FKU,176930,180870,with the right environment and the right home and lifestyle
IUwqf08-FKU,180870,184209,to keep them healthy and safe as long as possible.

IUwqf08-FKU,196580,198090,"Now hedgehogs in particular,"
IUwqf08-FKU,198090,201209,they are are illegal in the five boroughs of New York City.
IUwqf08-FKU,201210,203470,"The reasons are because number one,"
IUwqf08-FKU,203470,205850,they can carry diseases that can be transmitted
IUwqf08-FKU,205850,206720,to other animals.
IUwqf08-FKU,206720,208510,Foot and mouth disease is the big one.
IUwqf08-FKU,208510,211629,"And number two, oftentimes exotic animals are prohibited"
IUwqf08-FKU,211630,213190,"because if they were to escape,"
IUwqf08-FKU,213190,214980,they could do significant harm
IUwqf08-FKU,214980,216810,to the native wildlife in the area.
IUwqf08-FKU,216810,219430,And that's the case with hedgehogs in New York City.
IUwqf08-FKU,219430,222849,Here's the thing. Exotic pets are a handful.
IUwqf08-FKU,222850,224760,You gotta be careful with what you're getting
IUwqf08-FKU,224760,226610,into because they have unique needs
IUwqf08-FKU,226610,228730,in terms of the environment they need to live in.
IUwqf08-FKU,228730,230920,"So whether T Swift is doing it or not,"
IUwqf08-FKU,230920,233750,we all should think twice or maybe three times
IUwqf08-FKU,233750,236617,before we adopt an exotic animal as a pet.

IUwqf08-FKU,244210,245810,I wouldn't recommend injecting it.
IUwqf08-FKU,245810,248175,But it's not toxic. It's just urine.
IUwqf08-FKU,248175,252347,"@lpush_oldpeopl3 asks,"
IUwqf08-FKU,252347,253830,"""How do dogs get cancer?"
IUwqf08-FKU,253830,256739,"Like, I'm sorry, but are they smoking or sum?"""
IUwqf08-FKU,256739,258150,Here's the thing with dogs.
IUwqf08-FKU,258150,260489,They get cancer for a lot of the same reasons we do.
IUwqf08-FKU,260489,263449,"First of all, genetics. They can just be predisposed."
IUwqf08-FKU,263450,266400,Certain breeds are predisposed to certain types of cancers.
IUwqf08-FKU,266400,268740,"For example, we know that German shepherds"
IUwqf08-FKU,268740,271350,and boxer dogs have a much higher likelihood
IUwqf08-FKU,271351,275040,of developing a cancer called hemangiosarcoma.
IUwqf08-FKU,275040,276770,"We also know that, for example,"
IUwqf08-FKU,276770,279940,dogs with short hair can be more prone
IUwqf08-FKU,279940,282570,to developing something called a mast cell tumor.
IUwqf08-FKU,282570,284210,"But also, just like us,"
IUwqf08-FKU,284210,286470,dogs are a recipient of what's
IUwqf08-FKU,286470,287760,in the environment around them.
IUwqf08-FKU,287760,290310,So we know people sometimes get lung cancer
IUwqf08-FKU,290310,292370,even though they never smoked a day in their life.
IUwqf08-FKU,292370,294040,Same thing happens with dogs.
IUwqf08-FKU,294040,296230,They live in the household where someone is smoking.
IUwqf08-FKU,296230,298490,They're close to contaminants or toxins.
IUwqf08-FKU,298490,300220,Think about where a dog's nose is.
IUwqf08-FKU,300220,301780,All day they're down on the ground.
IUwqf08-FKU,301780,305070,"So we don't always know why a dog gets cancer,"
IUwqf08-FKU,305070,306860,but what we do know is they're exposed
IUwqf08-FKU,306860,309150,to the same kind of environments that we are.
IUwqf08-FKU,309150,310889,And so the same things that cause cancer
IUwqf08-FKU,310890,314310,"in people can cause cancer in dogs, unfortunately."
IUwqf08-FKU,314310,315830,"Okay, for this question,"
IUwqf08-FKU,315830,317280,I'm gonna need to call in the expert.
IUwqf08-FKU,317280,318240,Let's call in Jack.
IUwqf08-FKU,318240,319503,"Jack, come on!"
IUwqf08-FKU,321420,324637,"So @ItsMeLexie1 asks,"
IUwqf08-FKU,324637,326979,"""Are you supposed to brush a dog's teeth?"""
IUwqf08-FKU,326980,329250,And the simple answer to that question is yes.
IUwqf08-FKU,329250,332030,We find that about 80% of dogs
IUwqf08-FKU,332030,335160,that come into our hospitals and 85% of cats
IUwqf08-FKU,335160,337290,between the ages of three and ten come in
IUwqf08-FKU,337290,339380,with evidence of dental disease.
IUwqf08-FKU,339380,341620,So Jack here is a great example
IUwqf08-FKU,341620,343370,of a dog who will let you brush his teeth.
IUwqf08-FKU,343370,344560,And it's something that you can start
IUwqf08-FKU,344560,347130,with any dog or cat from a young age.
IUwqf08-FKU,347130,349750,"Jack, sit. Good boy."
IUwqf08-FKU,349750,352330,"So one way, if you've never done this before,"
IUwqf08-FKU,352330,354530,is to use a finger toothbrush.
IUwqf08-FKU,354530,357960,So what's important is we call it flip the lip.
IUwqf08-FKU,357960,360690,"You flip the lip up, you take a look at their teeth,"
IUwqf08-FKU,360690,362290,and you do a gentle scrub.
IUwqf08-FKU,362290,364480,"And then with bigger dogs or pets who are used to it,"
IUwqf08-FKU,364480,367600,you can actually use a special modified toothbrush
IUwqf08-FKU,367600,369100,that fits a dog's mouth.
IUwqf08-FKU,369100,370313,"You flip the lip,"
IUwqf08-FKU,371290,373710,and you go ahead and brush their teeth
IUwqf08-FKU,373710,377569,to remove that bacteria and that early source
IUwqf08-FKU,377570,381040,of dental infection or dental disease
IUwqf08-FKU,381040,382750,that we might find in our own teeth.
IUwqf08-FKU,382750,385570,The teeth provide a really great surface area
IUwqf08-FKU,385570,387450,for bacteria to grab hold.
IUwqf08-FKU,387450,390210,"And as they begin to climb up under the gums,"
IUwqf08-FKU,390210,393350,they have really easy access to the circulatory system.
IUwqf08-FKU,393350,396940,"And once those bacteria get into the circulatory system,"
IUwqf08-FKU,396940,398490,they spread throughout the body.
IUwqf08-FKU,398490,399970,So here's the thing when it comes
IUwqf08-FKU,399970,401520,to taking care of your pet's teeth.
IUwqf08-FKU,401520,404319,"The reality is that they lead a shorter life than us,"
IUwqf08-FKU,404320,405640,a more accelerated life.
IUwqf08-FKU,405640,408010,And so we should be taking care of their teeth
IUwqf08-FKU,408010,410610,"to the same degree as we take care of our own,"
IUwqf08-FKU,410610,412319,if not even more.
IUwqf08-FKU,412320,415967,"The next question from @PetsQandA is,"
IUwqf08-FKU,415967,418720,"""What's the best way to cut a dog's nail?"""
IUwqf08-FKU,418720,421370,What's really important is that you get your dog used
IUwqf08-FKU,421370,422590,to having their nails trimmed.
IUwqf08-FKU,422590,424580,And this is something that you can start as a puppy
IUwqf08-FKU,424580,426379,"because many dogs don't normally,"
IUwqf08-FKU,426380,428890,don't naturally like to have their paws touched.
IUwqf08-FKU,428890,431770,"So to cut a dog's nail, you want to look closely"
IUwqf08-FKU,431770,435169,and differentiate between the pink living flesh
IUwqf08-FKU,435170,436630,"of their nail and the white part,"
IUwqf08-FKU,436630,438620,"which is the same as the white part of our nails,"
IUwqf08-FKU,438620,441710,as it grows out beyond the blood vessels.
IUwqf08-FKU,441710,443340,"Now, this can be much harder to do"
IUwqf08-FKU,443340,444889,in a dog with a dark nail.
IUwqf08-FKU,444890,446510,And it's also important to recognize
IUwqf08-FKU,446510,448110,"that the more often you do it,"
IUwqf08-FKU,448110,450009,"the more frequently you trim their nails,"
IUwqf08-FKU,450010,451340,the easier it becomes.
IUwqf08-FKU,451340,453940,"They that helps the blood vessels to recede,"
IUwqf08-FKU,453940,456720,"so you're less likely to do what we call quicking them,"
IUwqf08-FKU,456720,458410,which means that you've cut it too short
IUwqf08-FKU,458410,460890,and you've actually cut into the sensitive tissue.
IUwqf08-FKU,460890,463240,But I can show you here just a little bit where
IUwqf08-FKU,464210,466410,"you find just the tip of the nail,"
IUwqf08-FKU,466410,468540,"insert it through the trimmer, quick trim."
IUwqf08-FKU,468540,470100,His are so short that all I'm having
IUwqf08-FKU,470100,472450,to do is just scrape off the very edge of them.
IUwqf08-FKU,473740,477199,Make sure your dog gets used to you holding his paws
IUwqf08-FKU,477200,479010,and gets comfortable with that idea
IUwqf08-FKU,479010,481027,and do it on a regular basis.
IUwqf08-FKU,481027,483827,@YubaVetTech posts a question of the day.
IUwqf08-FKU,483827,486410,"""How is heartworm spread? And what is heartworm?"""
IUwqf08-FKU,486410,488150,This is a fascinating question
IUwqf08-FKU,488150,490850,because heartworm is preventable.
IUwqf08-FKU,490850,493680,"It is extremely serious if dogs and cats acquire it,"
IUwqf08-FKU,493680,494870,but it is preventable.
IUwqf08-FKU,494870,496320,So heartworm disease. What is it?
IUwqf08-FKU,496320,498810,"Well, it's a parasite that's transmitted by mosquitoes."
IUwqf08-FKU,498810,499950,"A mosquito bites a dog,"
IUwqf08-FKU,499950,501870,"it picks up some baby parasites,"
IUwqf08-FKU,501870,503630,they develop within the mosquito
IUwqf08-FKU,503630,506750,and the next dog or cat that mosquito bites gets
IUwqf08-FKU,506750,507950,that heartworm disease.
IUwqf08-FKU,507950,510810,Those worms then spend about six months living
IUwqf08-FKU,510810,513440,"in that animal until they take up residence in the heart,"
IUwqf08-FKU,513440,515330,"where they mate, they reproduce,"
IUwqf08-FKU,515330,517800,and they produce their own little baby parasites.
IUwqf08-FKU,517800,519919,"When a dog or cat acquires heartworm,"
IUwqf08-FKU,519919,522139,it is fatal unless treated.
IUwqf08-FKU,522140,523940,"It is treatable in dogs,"
IUwqf08-FKU,523940,525750,although quite expensive and quite risky.
IUwqf08-FKU,525750,527940,It is not treatable in cats.
IUwqf08-FKU,527940,530950,"So the end of the story, we need to prevent it."
IUwqf08-FKU,530950,532850,This is a really important question this year
IUwqf08-FKU,532850,535639,because we know that because of temperature
IUwqf08-FKU,535640,538540,"and climate changes that are expected in 2022,"
IUwqf08-FKU,538540,540589,there will be a higher instance of heartworm.
IUwqf08-FKU,540590,542500,So if you aren't using heartworm preventative
IUwqf08-FKU,542500,545550,"for your dog and cat today, go talk to your veterinarian."
IUwqf08-FKU,545550,546839,Every pet should be

IUwqf08-FKU,551347,554149,"""Why the hell would you declaw a cat?"""
IUwqf08-FKU,554150,556300,Do you know what declawing a cat actually is?
IUwqf08-FKU,556300,559970,It's amputation of the end digits of their fingers
IUwqf08-FKU,559970,561310,to remove their claws.
IUwqf08-FKU,561310,563200,And that actually has been shown to result
IUwqf08-FKU,563200,567300,in long term chronic pain for cats who have been declawed.
IUwqf08-FKU,567300,570350,"You know, the veterinary hospital that I work for, Banfield,"
IUwqf08-FKU,570350,573810,along with many others does not condone the practice
IUwqf08-FKU,573810,575290,of declawing cats anymore.
IUwqf08-FKU,575290,577519,It does not generally solve the problem
IUwqf08-FKU,577520,580850,"it's intended to solve, which is cats scratching or clawing."
IUwqf08-FKU,580850,583329,And it is painful and harmful
IUwqf08-FKU,583330,585600,to the long-term wellbeing of our cats.
IUwqf08-FKU,585600,587120,So let's not declaw cats.
IUwqf08-FKU,587120,588540,Let's talk to veterinary teams
IUwqf08-FKU,588540,591657,about what other options are available for them.
IUwqf08-FKU,591657,595187,"@KJyoung428 asks the question,"
IUwqf08-FKU,595187,597970,"""What are the benefits and negative effects"
IUwqf08-FKU,597970,599920,"of neutering a male dog?"""
IUwqf08-FKU,599920,602760,"Number one, minimizing overpopulation."
IUwqf08-FKU,602760,604890,"If they're neutered, they can't reproduce,"
IUwqf08-FKU,604890,606930,so we won't have unwanted puppies.
IUwqf08-FKU,606930,608470,There are a couple of other benefits.
IUwqf08-FKU,608470,612209,One being that neutering a dog causes some behavior changes.
IUwqf08-FKU,612210,614500,Primarily important to most pet owners is
IUwqf08-FKU,614500,617130,that it diminishes their likelihood of roaming.
IUwqf08-FKU,617130,618400,The other thing that's related
IUwqf08-FKU,618400,620390,to that sort of wandering behavior is
IUwqf08-FKU,620390,622680,that unneutered male dogs are more likely
IUwqf08-FKU,622680,624050,to be hit by a car.
IUwqf08-FKU,624050,626170,That's really just secondary to the fact
IUwqf08-FKU,626170,628100,that they're out wandering about.
IUwqf08-FKU,628100,630160,But there are a couple of reasons like that
IUwqf08-FKU,630160,632009,"that make it wise to neuter a dog,"
IUwqf08-FKU,632010,634157,if you don't have any intentions of breeding them.
IUwqf08-FKU,634157,635756,"@PetMD asks,"
IUwqf08-FKU,635757,639440,"""What is grain-free pet food really?"""
IUwqf08-FKU,639440,642090,"Logistically, grain-free pet food means"
IUwqf08-FKU,642090,644860,"that the pet food has taken traditional ingredients,"
IUwqf08-FKU,644860,646230,"like wheat and corn,"
IUwqf08-FKU,646230,650220,and replace them with something like legumes or potatoes.
IUwqf08-FKU,650220,653430,"So the food still has a carbohydrate source,"
IUwqf08-FKU,653430,656610,but it's been changed from a grain to a non-grain.
IUwqf08-FKU,656610,657930,Here's the thing we really have to get
IUwqf08-FKU,657930,661520,"at with this question is, is grain-free actually better?"
IUwqf08-FKU,661520,664070,And the reality is that what is most important
IUwqf08-FKU,664070,667470,in any pet food is the nutrients that are conveyed
IUwqf08-FKU,667470,668329,to the pet.
IUwqf08-FKU,668330,671480,"The fat, the protein, the carbohydrates,"
IUwqf08-FKU,671480,673829,"the minerals, the vitamins, et cetera."
IUwqf08-FKU,673830,675640,So what you wanna look at for a food
IUwqf08-FKU,675640,678400,"is not whether it's grain-free or not,"
IUwqf08-FKU,678400,681500,but you wanna look at the overall nutrient profile
IUwqf08-FKU,681500,684110,and definitely talk with your veterinary team
IUwqf08-FKU,684110,685800,to find the right diet
IUwqf08-FKU,685800,689397,that suits your pet's unique nutritional needs.

IUwqf08-FKU,695620,696990,can I give him another dose?
IUwqf08-FKU,696990,698320,I think he needs it.
IUwqf08-FKU,698320,701190,"If I can find any with all the weirdos buying it."""
IUwqf08-FKU,701190,704800,Humans should not be buying horse medicine for humans.
IUwqf08-FKU,704800,706029,It's for horses.
IUwqf08-FKU,706030,708650,"If you dewormed your horse in June and it's July,"
IUwqf08-FKU,708650,710790,"for example, you don't need to deworm them again."
IUwqf08-FKU,710790,712980,Horses generally need to be dewormed
IUwqf08-FKU,712980,714430,in the spring and the fall.
IUwqf08-FKU,714430,715263,"Worse comes to worse,"
IUwqf08-FKU,715263,717870,your vet can run what we call a fecal examination
IUwqf08-FKU,717870,720610,"on your horse's feces, on their poop, on their manure,"
IUwqf08-FKU,720610,723380,and find out if it does indeed have parasites
IUwqf08-FKU,723380,724520,and need to be dewormed.
IUwqf08-FKU,724520,725730,That's a foolproof way.
IUwqf08-FKU,725730,727269,You can cause harm
IUwqf08-FKU,727270,729330,by deworming a horse when they don't need it
IUwqf08-FKU,729330,732770,because we can actually cause resistance against
IUwqf08-FKU,732770,735460,the medications that we use to deworm horses
IUwqf08-FKU,735460,738760,in those parasites that do exist in the environment.

IUwqf08-FKU,744270,747040,"to take its medication without being attacked?"""
IUwqf08-FKU,747040,749449,"First of all, if you're lucky enough to have a dog"
IUwqf08-FKU,749450,752520,"or cat that will take their medication in their food,"
IUwqf08-FKU,752520,753750,make sure you talk to your vet
IUwqf08-FKU,753750,755680,and get something that's suitable to provide
IUwqf08-FKU,755680,756740,to them in that form.
IUwqf08-FKU,756740,758920,They also make some great treats that you can buy
IUwqf08-FKU,758920,760510,over the counter that have little holes
IUwqf08-FKU,760510,762440,in them that enable you to put a pill
IUwqf08-FKU,762440,763720,"or a little bit of liquid,"
IUwqf08-FKU,763720,766579,so you can give your pet a treat as you medicate them.
IUwqf08-FKU,766580,767960,And many pets will take that.
IUwqf08-FKU,767960,771160,Some require the use of a little more intervention.
IUwqf08-FKU,771160,773639,"For example, we make something called a pill gun,"
IUwqf08-FKU,773640,775840,"which helps you to take the pill,"
IUwqf08-FKU,775840,777730,"get it to the back of your pet's mouth,"
IUwqf08-FKU,777730,780089,and kind of shoot it in so that they swallow it
IUwqf08-FKU,780090,781570,without too much resistance.
IUwqf08-FKU,781570,784870,"So if it's not working, talk to your veterinary team,"
IUwqf08-FKU,784870,786940,and there's definitely alternatives out there.
IUwqf08-FKU,786940,789570,So those are all the questions we have time for today.
IUwqf08-FKU,789570,791970,"But Jack, those were some great questions, weren't they?"
IUwqf08-FKU,791970,792902,Yeah.
