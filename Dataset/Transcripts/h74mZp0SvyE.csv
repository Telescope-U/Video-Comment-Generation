h74mZp0SvyE,0,2603,"(upbeat music begins) - Well, that didn't take long."
h74mZp0SvyE,2603,5490,AMD's Threadripper lineup revitalized
h74mZp0SvyE,5490,9019,the high end enthusiast desktop space when it first dropped.
h74mZp0SvyE,9020,14000,"And now after a few short years, it no longer exists."
h74mZp0SvyE,14000,14870,That's right.
h74mZp0SvyE,14870,17983,"AMD just announced their new Zen 3 based,"
h74mZp0SvyE,17983,20060,Threadripper Pro chips yesterday.
h74mZp0SvyE,20060,22210,And they look great.
h74mZp0SvyE,22210,23980,But note the pro.
h74mZp0SvyE,23980,27470,These bad boys aren't gonna be on store shelves near you.
h74mZp0SvyE,27470,28670,They're OEM only.
h74mZp0SvyE,28670,31030,And they aren't going to be cheap.
h74mZp0SvyE,31030,31890,That's right.
h74mZp0SvyE,31890,32950,"Now that they're on top,"
h74mZp0SvyE,32950,35186,"it seems like AMD is resting on their laurels,"
h74mZp0SvyE,35186,37470,just like Intel did.
h74mZp0SvyE,37470,40000,And this announcement demonstrates once again
h74mZp0SvyE,40000,43300,that AMD is not your friend.
h74mZp0SvyE,43300,44780,"You know, who is though?"
h74mZp0SvyE,44780,45770,Actually they're not your friend.
h74mZp0SvyE,45770,46620,They're just our sponsor.
h74mZp0SvyE,46620,47500,They're our friend.
h74mZp0SvyE,47500,49430,"Build Redux offers competitive pricing,"
h74mZp0SvyE,49430,51160,compared to building a PC yourself.
h74mZp0SvyE,51160,53580,And their website makes it easy to configure your build
h74mZp0SvyE,53580,55480,alongside their helpful support guides.
h74mZp0SvyE,55480,57660,"Head to buildredux.com/linus,"
h74mZp0SvyE,57660,59638,and start creating your PC today.
h74mZp0SvyE,59638,62138,"(""Supernova"")"
h74mZp0SvyE,68740,69799,"Oh, here we go."
h74mZp0SvyE,69800,72650,"Linus is ranting about evil corporations again,"
h74mZp0SvyE,72650,74190,but hear me out.
h74mZp0SvyE,74190,77020,AMD's Threadripper Pro 5000 series CPUs are
h74mZp0SvyE,77020,80774,a Zen 3 refresh of the Threadripper Pro 3000 series
h74mZp0SvyE,80775,83790,"and come with every, everything that Zen 3 implies."
h74mZp0SvyE,83790,86280,"Higher core clocks, better memory controllers,"
h74mZp0SvyE,86280,88880,"more cache in the eight core CCX arrangement,"
h74mZp0SvyE,88880,90960,and AMD's shadow stack feature
h74mZp0SvyE,90960,93229,that protects against buffer overflows.
h74mZp0SvyE,93230,96960,They also come with increasingly enterprise focused features
h74mZp0SvyE,96960,99370,"like more memory capacity and channels,"
h74mZp0SvyE,99370,102930,"more PCI express lanes, and a bigger price tag,"
h74mZp0SvyE,102930,103920,which is great.
h74mZp0SvyE,103920,105860,"Awesome, love it."
h74mZp0SvyE,105860,107620,But I have one question.
h74mZp0SvyE,107620,111230,Where are the cheaper non-pro Threadrippers?
h74mZp0SvyE,111230,112120,What's that?
h74mZp0SvyE,112120,113820,There aren't any?
h74mZp0SvyE,113820,117340,"Well, then, what happened to socket sTRX4?"
h74mZp0SvyE,117340,121762,"Oh, it's dead like X399 after only one generation?"
h74mZp0SvyE,123130,124433,That is such a shame.
h74mZp0SvyE,125270,127710,"Now look, AMD is a publicly traded company"
h74mZp0SvyE,127710,130509,and that means that they're actually legally obligated
h74mZp0SvyE,130509,132659,to do whatever they can to increase profits
h74mZp0SvyE,132660,133770,for their shareholders.
h74mZp0SvyE,133770,135910,"Legally, like, if they didn't do it,"
h74mZp0SvyE,135910,138210,they could be sued by their shareholders.
h74mZp0SvyE,138210,139920,So when faced with the prospect
h74mZp0SvyE,139920,141530,of using those Zen 3 chiplets
h74mZp0SvyE,141530,143950,to power lower cost consumer
h74mZp0SvyE,143950,145860,"or enthusiast Threadripper processors,"
h74mZp0SvyE,145860,148770,compared to jacking up the price for Threadripper Pro
h74mZp0SvyE,148770,151520,"and just not selling consumer chips anymore,"
h74mZp0SvyE,151520,154520,you gotta bet that they're gonna choose Threadripper Pro.
h74mZp0SvyE,154520,155353,"After all,"
h74mZp0SvyE,155353,158340,you gotta remember who it was that introduced the concept
h74mZp0SvyE,158340,160290,of a thousand dollars consumer CPU
h74mZp0SvyE,160290,162870,"when they were on top, back in the 2000s."
h74mZp0SvyE,162870,163730,Here's a hint.
h74mZp0SvyE,163730,165264,It wasn't Intel?
h74mZp0SvyE,165264,167170,"Yes, they make good products."
h74mZp0SvyE,167170,169940,"And yes, they've been an underdog for a long time"
h74mZp0SvyE,169940,173610,but when AMD can take advantage of their top dog position
h74mZp0SvyE,173610,177700,"they have, and they will, just like Intel."
h74mZp0SvyE,177700,180810,So why did they make Threadripper in the first place then?
h74mZp0SvyE,180810,182849,"If you ask me, mindshare."
h74mZp0SvyE,182850,185620,"The OG Threadrippers, the 1000 series."
h74mZp0SvyE,185620,189040,If you believe the story weren't even on AMD's roadmap
h74mZp0SvyE,189040,191659,and launching them supposedly provided AMD
h74mZp0SvyE,191660,194880,with just another piece of their product stack
h74mZp0SvyE,194880,197980,"to put even more Zen chips in machines worldwide,"
h74mZp0SvyE,197980,200069,meanwhile slapping team blue
h74mZp0SvyE,200070,202410,"in yet another one of their traditional strongholds,"
h74mZp0SvyE,202410,204118,the high end desktop market.
h74mZp0SvyE,204118,206660,There's just one problem with that in today's world.
h74mZp0SvyE,206660,208670,And that's where this conversation
h74mZp0SvyE,208670,210860,takes a bit of a weird turn.
h74mZp0SvyE,210860,214077,"The high end desktop concept for enthusiasts is,"
h74mZp0SvyE,214077,217360,"in my opinion, currently obsolete."
h74mZp0SvyE,217360,218290,Think about it.
h74mZp0SvyE,218290,222319,"Intel hasn't released an HEDT platform since mid 2017,"
h74mZp0SvyE,222320,225780,"and they haven't released a chip for one since late 2019,"
h74mZp0SvyE,225780,227690,which coincidentally is around the time
h74mZp0SvyE,227690,230730,that the last consumer Threadripper chip was announced.
h74mZp0SvyE,230730,232900,So what happened?
h74mZp0SvyE,232900,234140,Ryzen happened.
h74mZp0SvyE,234140,239140,The 16 core Ryzen 9 3950x also launched in late 2019.
h74mZp0SvyE,239450,240730,And for the first time
h74mZp0SvyE,240730,244330,"you were able to get truly HEDT core counts,"
h74mZp0SvyE,244330,247860,"16 freakin' cores, on a desktop platform."
h74mZp0SvyE,247860,251120,"Remember, the first gen Threadripper, the 1000 series,"
h74mZp0SvyE,251120,254060,actually capped out at 16 cores.
h74mZp0SvyE,254060,256660,So ne'er we had a desktop platform now
h74mZp0SvyE,256660,259690,"with PCIe Gen 4 for massive bandwidth,"
h74mZp0SvyE,259690,263100,and dropping at a time when late generation DDR4 modules
h74mZp0SvyE,263100,264370,"with higher capacities,"
h74mZp0SvyE,264370,266330,we're rolling off the production lines.
h74mZp0SvyE,266330,269520,So overnight both Intel's X299
h74mZp0SvyE,269520,271539,and AMD's Threadripper platforms
h74mZp0SvyE,271540,275070,became significantly less appealing for most users
h74mZp0SvyE,275070,276820,because their major selling points were now
h74mZp0SvyE,276820,279960,being cannibalized by the consumer desktop platform.
h74mZp0SvyE,279960,281660,The last consumer Threadripper chips
h74mZp0SvyE,281660,284000,that came out then in early 2020
h74mZp0SvyE,284000,286425,"tried to stay relevant with up to 64 cores,"
h74mZp0SvyE,286425,291425,"256 gigs of RAM, and 88 total PCI express Gen 4 lanes."
h74mZp0SvyE,292100,295520,But how many people made use of all of that
h74mZp0SvyE,295520,299569,but then didn't need much more memory capacity?
h74mZp0SvyE,299570,301830,How many prosumers were really building
h74mZp0SvyE,301830,305069,their own Threadripper rigs versus buying prebuilt systems
h74mZp0SvyE,305070,307660,with enterprise features and support?
h74mZp0SvyE,307660,310090,That's the question AMD apparently asked themselves.
h74mZp0SvyE,310090,313020,And the answer seems to have been very few.
h74mZp0SvyE,313020,314629,"And honestly speaking,"
h74mZp0SvyE,314630,317080,I don't like that HEDT is basically dead.
h74mZp0SvyE,317080,320849,"I hate it, but I get it."
h74mZp0SvyE,320850,323460,Maybe what AMD is really doing here is creating
h74mZp0SvyE,323460,325430,a product lineup that better reflects
h74mZp0SvyE,325430,327960,what their customers are actually buying.
h74mZp0SvyE,327960,330900,And it's kind of a smart move.
h74mZp0SvyE,330900,332740,As consumer platforms start rolling out
h74mZp0SvyE,332740,334880,"with PCI express Gen 5,"
h74mZp0SvyE,334880,336326,"the need for additional lanes,"
h74mZp0SvyE,336326,339000,is going to be seriously reduced.
h74mZp0SvyE,339000,340230,There's even talk already
h74mZp0SvyE,340230,342930,of reducing SSDs to just two lanes
h74mZp0SvyE,342930,344750,once Gen 5 hits the data center
h74mZp0SvyE,344750,346480,because the bandwidth is already there
h74mZp0SvyE,346480,349110,and it makes no sense to tie up the extra lanes
h74mZp0SvyE,349110,350650,"and the associated pins,"
h74mZp0SvyE,350650,352680,and design complexity that come with them.
h74mZp0SvyE,352680,354669,And while it's not quite the same thing
h74mZp0SvyE,354670,356230,"as quad channel memory,"
h74mZp0SvyE,356230,357980,DDR5's double burst length
h74mZp0SvyE,357980,360690,with two sub channels per module effectively means
h74mZp0SvyE,360690,363665,that memory transfers get similar latency benefits.
h74mZp0SvyE,363665,367380,"And quite frankly, at risk of being quoted out of context,"
h74mZp0SvyE,367380,369900,"'cause I'm all about that more power,"
h74mZp0SvyE,369900,374389,"well, 16 cores ought to be enough for anybody, today."
h74mZp0SvyE,374390,375380,"If you don't find that comforting,"
h74mZp0SvyE,375380,377740,"maybe pick up a swacket from a lttstore.com,"
h74mZp0SvyE,377740,380210,unlike Threadripper they are not discontinued.
h74mZp0SvyE,380210,382850,And I know that kind of thing might upset you
h74mZp0SvyE,382850,385000,"as an enthusiast, but think about it."
h74mZp0SvyE,385000,388610,What workloads need 16 cores right now?
h74mZp0SvyE,388610,391099,"We're in the middle of a software design paradigm shift,"
h74mZp0SvyE,391100,393170,"like when we went from single to dual core,"
h74mZp0SvyE,393170,395210,and dual to quad core.
h74mZp0SvyE,395210,398380,It took and is taking a while for developers
h74mZp0SvyE,398380,402570,to figure out the best way to utilize these extra cores.
h74mZp0SvyE,402570,405270,And quad core turned out to be enough
h74mZp0SvyE,405270,406889,"as recently as five years ago,"
h74mZp0SvyE,406890,410220,"because, well, dammit, Intel said it was enough."
h74mZp0SvyE,410220,411053,"And also,"
h74mZp0SvyE,411053,413800,because utilizing those extra cores really is a struggle.
h74mZp0SvyE,413800,416099,"And going all the way to 16,"
h74mZp0SvyE,416100,419080,even power users are having a hard time imagining
h74mZp0SvyE,419080,420860,how to fully utilize them.
h74mZp0SvyE,420860,422039,- It's true.
h74mZp0SvyE,422040,424390,I've got a 12 core 3900X at home.
h74mZp0SvyE,424390,427950,And honestly I don't use all those cores most of the time.
h74mZp0SvyE,427950,430520,If I didn't dabble with running multiple virtual machines
h74mZp0SvyE,430520,431720,I'd be just as well off
h74mZp0SvyE,431720,434460,"with an eight core or even a six core CPU,"
h74mZp0SvyE,434460,436710,especially if all I wanted to do was game.
h74mZp0SvyE,436710,440470,"In fact, six cores is what I went with for my VR rig."
h74mZp0SvyE,440470,442840,"Now, sure, there's stuff like compiling code"
h74mZp0SvyE,442840,444410,and non GPU rendering.
h74mZp0SvyE,444410,445243,"But the reality is,"
h74mZp0SvyE,445243,447550,that anybody's serious enough about coding or graphics
h74mZp0SvyE,447550,448818,to be looking at a Threadripper
h74mZp0SvyE,448818,450729,would probably also be looking
h74mZp0SvyE,450730,452730,"at a separate build or render box,"
h74mZp0SvyE,452730,454470,so their workstation isn't unusable
h74mZp0SvyE,454470,455900,while the job's being done.
h74mZp0SvyE,455900,459570,"If, say, I ran a Plex instance, a personal web server,"
h74mZp0SvyE,459570,461880,and maybe mess around with a Windows
h74mZp0SvyE,461880,463140,"or Mac OS virtual machine,"
h74mZp0SvyE,463140,464970,that'd be roughly half my dozen cores.
h74mZp0SvyE,464970,466410,And I'd probably be more pressured
h74mZp0SvyE,466410,468400,on memory and storage at that point.
h74mZp0SvyE,468400,472236,"Now, would I complain if I had 16 cores to play with?"
h74mZp0SvyE,472236,474530,(chuckles) No.
h74mZp0SvyE,474530,476290,But I don't need them either.
h74mZp0SvyE,476290,478740,I don't even need what I have now.
h74mZp0SvyE,478740,481360,"By the time I do pricing for those extra cores,"
h74mZp0SvyE,481360,483050,not to mention platform features
h74mZp0SvyE,483050,485479,"like PCI express Gen 5 and DDR5,"
h74mZp0SvyE,485480,488740,will have come down and it'll all be more mature to boot.
h74mZp0SvyE,488740,490560,"The only times I've personally gone for like,"
h74mZp0SvyE,490560,495210,"the top end consumer processors were the Core i7 3770K,"
h74mZp0SvyE,495210,497460,"I got with Intel Retail Edge on the cheap,"
h74mZp0SvyE,497460,499530,"and the Core i7 6700K,"
h74mZp0SvyE,499530,503360,near the tail end of the quad-core-is-all-you-need years.
h74mZp0SvyE,503360,506169,So I'd have the extra threads to work with.
h74mZp0SvyE,506170,508970,"And that's just me comparing my 12 cores to 16,"
h74mZp0SvyE,508970,511900,let alone Threadripper with up to 64.
h74mZp0SvyE,511900,514315,Now you could argue that Threadripper would stay relevant
h74mZp0SvyE,514315,517050,"for way longer than any desktop chip would,"
h74mZp0SvyE,517050,519880,but you'd be wrong about that.
h74mZp0SvyE,519880,522810,The 16 core Threadripper 1950X workstation
h74mZp0SvyE,522810,526870,that I used to type this script is slow as balls.
h74mZp0SvyE,526870,529480,And I have never once used all the cores.
h74mZp0SvyE,529480,534190,I desperately want more IPC and faster memory.
h74mZp0SvyE,534190,536166,I'd happily trade for a 5800X
h74mZp0SvyE,536166,538670,or even a 5600X and some fast memory.
h74mZp0SvyE,538670,541420,I'm not even using more PCI express lanes
h74mZp0SvyE,541420,544339,than a modern Ryzen desktop can handle.
h74mZp0SvyE,544340,545800,And I'm Anthony.
h74mZp0SvyE,545800,546709,"- All of that said,"
h74mZp0SvyE,546710,549490,the workstation experience is still there.
h74mZp0SvyE,549490,551450,"And Threadripper Pro is here to stay,"
h74mZp0SvyE,551450,554150,and makes more sense to more customers looking
h74mZp0SvyE,554150,557270,for something that's in between Ryzen and Epyc
h74mZp0SvyE,557270,558876,compared to the OG Threadripper.
h74mZp0SvyE,558876,560009,"And don't worry,"
h74mZp0SvyE,560010,561780,we will definitely be doing a deeper dive
h74mZp0SvyE,561780,562890,on these Zen 3 behemoths.
h74mZp0SvyE,562890,565250,So make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss it.
h74mZp0SvyE,565250,567155,"For now, I don't like"
h74mZp0SvyE,567155,570130,"that they've hung Threadripper customers out to dry,"
h74mZp0SvyE,570130,571290,and neither do you.
h74mZp0SvyE,571290,573209,"In fact, I'd encourage you to be angry about it"
h74mZp0SvyE,573210,576670,because quite frankly proving that there's still a market is
h74mZp0SvyE,576670,579790,the only way that AMD might listen and reverse course here.
h74mZp0SvyE,579790,582329,But I would also encourage you to reassess your needs
h74mZp0SvyE,582330,585030,and consider whether you might be just as well served
h74mZp0SvyE,585030,587750,by the coming generation of consumer CPUs.
h74mZp0SvyE,587750,589230,"It's not as glamorous,"
h74mZp0SvyE,589230,593209,"and it doesn't look as great on your Instagram feed,"
h74mZp0SvyE,593210,595430,"but it's gonna have wider support,"
h74mZp0SvyE,595430,598260,and a lot more versatile form factors.
