p-hvI1nbS80,1880,14800,O Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
p-hvI1nbS80,14800,27840,Consider all the worlds  Thy hands have made
p-hvI1nbS80,27840,41239,I see the stars I hear the rolling thunder
p-hvI1nbS80,41240,54240,Thy power throughout the universe displayed
p-hvI1nbS80,54240,67320,Then sings my soul My Saviour God to Thee

p-hvI1nbS80,198880,211640,How great Thou art How great Thou art
p-hvI1nbS80,218680,231920,When Christ shall come With shout of acclamation
p-hvI1nbS80,231920,244800,And take me home What joy shall fill my heart
p-hvI1nbS80,244800,257959,Then I shall bow In humble adoration
p-hvI1nbS80,257959,263240,And then proclaim
p-hvI1nbS80,263240,271240,My God How great Thou art
p-hvI1nbS80,271240,284120,Then sings my soul My Saviour God to Thee
