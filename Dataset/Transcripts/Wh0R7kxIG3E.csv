Wh0R7kxIG3E,75680,78320,adding on tricks so now we're rolling
Wh0R7kxIG3E,78320,79360,but that ain't a trick
Wh0R7kxIG3E,79360,81520,the easiest one to start off with is the
Wh0R7kxIG3E,81520,83119,pop shoving
Wh0R7kxIG3E,83119,85520,put some quick pressure on the tail
Wh0R7kxIG3E,85520,87759,scoop that finger at the same time
Wh0R7kxIG3E,87759,90400,this is more finesse than muscle so easy
Wh0R7kxIG3E,90400,91360,does it
Wh0R7kxIG3E,91360,93439,there's tons of shove it variations for
Wh0R7kxIG3E,93439,95680,you to stay busy on for a while
Wh0R7kxIG3E,95680,98240,so just make that board do a 180 while
Wh0R7kxIG3E,98240,100560,your hand stands straight boom
Wh0R7kxIG3E,100560,103759,now we're doing something the ollie
Wh0R7kxIG3E,103759,106079,almost every trick starts with an ollie
Wh0R7kxIG3E,106079,107920,so pay attention because this one
Wh0R7kxIG3E,107920,110960,is important first off lean that hand
Wh0R7kxIG3E,110960,111520,back
Wh0R7kxIG3E,111520,112960,there's no way you're going to be able
Wh0R7kxIG3E,112960,114720,to pop standing straight up like a
Wh0R7kxIG3E,114720,115600,scarecrow
Wh0R7kxIG3E,115600,118640,in a quick single fluid move snap that
Wh0R7kxIG3E,118640,119520,tail down
Wh0R7kxIG3E,119520,121360,and right as it's hitting the ground
Wh0R7kxIG3E,121360,123439,slide your whole hand forward to
Wh0R7kxIG3E,123439,125759,level it out in the air here's a low key
Wh0R7kxIG3E,125759,128080,hack for you sometimes it's easier
Wh0R7kxIG3E,128080,130800,to get a feel for it by practicing on a
Wh0R7kxIG3E,130800,131360,wall
Wh0R7kxIG3E,131360,134160,or on your leg
Wh0R7kxIG3E,134800,136640,once you've got that ollie popping try
Wh0R7kxIG3E,136640,140400,to turn your hand and rotate 180 degrees
Wh0R7kxIG3E,140400,141520,in midair
Wh0R7kxIG3E,141520,145040,this is called a 180.
Wh0R7kxIG3E,145040,146640,this trick is a little more advanced
Wh0R7kxIG3E,146640,149040,than the beginner status so don't trip
Wh0R7kxIG3E,149040,150959,if you can't land it right away
Wh0R7kxIG3E,150959,153120,start with a normal ollie but as it's
Wh0R7kxIG3E,153120,154720,popping into the air
Wh0R7kxIG3E,154720,157360,slide that pointer finger toward the
Wh0R7kxIG3E,157360,158560,nose at an angle
Wh0R7kxIG3E,158560,161120,and watch it spin stomp it down right
Wh0R7kxIG3E,161120,163840,away and post that one on the internet
Wh0R7kxIG3E,163840,165760,because that's what makes the likes
