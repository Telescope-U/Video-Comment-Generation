tyl5_JOLxRE,7600,9519,characters and hey
tyl5_JOLxRE,9519,11920,with there being tons and tons of lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,11920,13679,games let's take a look at the best
tyl5_JOLxRE,13679,16960,character from every single lego game
tyl5_JOLxRE,16960,19920,now obviously it is my opinion but i do
tyl5_JOLxRE,19920,21680,hope you got to resonate with a few of
tyl5_JOLxRE,21680,23359,them and i mean it we are literally
tyl5_JOLxRE,23359,25599,looking at every single lego game apart
tyl5_JOLxRE,25599,27359,from lego stars the original trilogy and
tyl5_JOLxRE,27359,29039,lego stars the video game because we've
tyl5_JOLxRE,29039,31920,got the complete saga so let's cue the
tyl5_JOLxRE,31920,34160,music actually pause it pause it pause
tyl5_JOLxRE,34160,36320,it let's have sweet childhood man let's
tyl5_JOLxRE,36320,39040,change it up a little bit ah so hello

tyl5_JOLxRE,51039,52719,content and thank you everyone for the
tyl5_JOLxRE,52719,55600,support let's get into it our first lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,55600,57440,game on the list is lego stars the
tyl5_JOLxRE,57440,61039,complete saga at number 26. now this one
tyl5_JOLxRE,61039,63440,for me is very very very easy and he's
tyl5_JOLxRE,63440,65280,actually the hardest character to unlock
tyl5_JOLxRE,65280,67520,in this game and that is force ghostly
tyl5_JOLxRE,67520,70000,order now let's just start with one the
tyl5_JOLxRE,70000,72720,character is invincible and cannot die
tyl5_JOLxRE,72720,75280,at all and he looks absolutely amazing
tyl5_JOLxRE,75280,78000,for number two and number three it's
tyl5_JOLxRE,78000,80479,yoda and thinking of it it's kind of
tyl5_JOLxRE,80479,82159,criminal that lego star wars the
tyl5_JOLxRE,82159,84400,skywalker saga didn't allow us to have
tyl5_JOLxRE,84400,86799,false ghost yoda as a character like
tyl5_JOLxRE,86799,89040,what get the whole projector board out
tyl5_JOLxRE,89040,91280,of it i know i'm aware of it but i want
tyl5_JOLxRE,91280,93759,false ghost yoda and i have to say that
tyl5_JOLxRE,93759,96240,character definitely belongs in a museum
tyl5_JOLxRE,96240,98000,it's time to move on to lego indiana
tyl5_JOLxRE,98000,100799,jones what now i'm sure we all can agree
tyl5_JOLxRE,100799,102960,with this one the best character in lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,102960,105280,indiana jones the original adventures is
tyl5_JOLxRE,105280,107759,lego indiana jones and i mean he's just
tyl5_JOLxRE,107759,110240,such a fun character to use in and out
tyl5_JOLxRE,110240,112720,of the story and hey with the new
tyl5_JOLxRE,112720,114880,indiana jones film release and i really
tyl5_JOLxRE,114880,117119,hope we get to see lego indie maker
tyl5_JOLxRE,117119,119600,return with all five movies in one game
tyl5_JOLxRE,119600,121280,with voicelands oh
tyl5_JOLxRE,121280,124000,that would be epic next up is lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,124000,126719,batman one now funnily enough lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,126719,129039,batman one actually has the smallest
tyl5_JOLxRE,129039,131039,character roster out of every single
tyl5_JOLxRE,131039,132879,lego game we have ever seen i mean look
tyl5_JOLxRE,132879,135200,at it it's tiny i swear that were bigger
tyl5_JOLxRE,135200,137520,when i was younger i swear yeah there
tyl5_JOLxRE,137520,140480,was literally only 46 characters in lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,140480,142560,batman one and it is very very clear who
tyl5_JOLxRE,142560,144720,the best character is it's obviously
tyl5_JOLxRE,144720,147120,robin
tyl5_JOLxRE,147760,150239,no but really the real answer is mr
tyl5_JOLxRE,150239,153519,freeze this character is broken i mean
tyl5_JOLxRE,153519,155840,i'm not even joking he's freeze gun
tyl5_JOLxRE,155840,158480,literally decimates anything in its path
tyl5_JOLxRE,158480,161040,it just turns into this ice cube and to
tyl5_JOLxRE,161040,163120,top it off the character also comes
tyl5_JOLxRE,163120,165599,equipped with super strength yeah mr
tyl5_JOLxRE,165599,168319,freeze is a unit and i just remember the
tyl5_JOLxRE,168319,170400,simple days where are we knocking asylum
tyl5_JOLxRE,170400,172239,when our younger freezing everyone has
tyl5_JOLxRE,172239,174640,missed a freeze yeah they were the good
tyl5_JOLxRE,174640,177120,days until obviously the day where i had
tyl5_JOLxRE,177120,179760,to fight mr freeze all that boss battle
tyl5_JOLxRE,179760,182480,is nasty so next up is actually one of
tyl5_JOLxRE,182480,184879,the worst rated lego games and that
tyl5_JOLxRE,184879,186959,released a year after lego batman 1 and
tyl5_JOLxRE,186959,190000,it's lego indiana jones 2. now i
tyl5_JOLxRE,190000,192560,personally didn't find the game that bad
tyl5_JOLxRE,192560,194400,but i know a lot of people don't really
tyl5_JOLxRE,194400,196480,like this lego game but i have to say
tyl5_JOLxRE,196480,198400,the best character in this one is not
tyl5_JOLxRE,198400,200480,actually indiana jones it's the crystal
tyl5_JOLxRE,200480,201800,skull or the
tyl5_JOLxRE,201800,204159,extraterrestrial actually my bad it's
tyl5_JOLxRE,204159,205040,the um
tyl5_JOLxRE,205040,207519,the interdimensional being now this
tyl5_JOLxRE,207519,209040,character is one of the more unique
tyl5_JOLxRE,209040,211040,cavities in lego indiana jones 2 because
tyl5_JOLxRE,211040,212560,he's nothing like all the other
tyl5_JOLxRE,212560,213519,characters because he's an
tyl5_JOLxRE,213519,215280,interdimensional being and he uses
tyl5_JOLxRE,215280,217519,telekinesis to fight and he's got an
tyl5_JOLxRE,217519,219680,absolute wicked design and this
tyl5_JOLxRE,219680,221920,character for me is the most memorable
tyl5_JOLxRE,221920,224080,character from lego indiana jones 2
tyl5_JOLxRE,224080,225760,because he's the most unique he's
tyl5_JOLxRE,225760,227599,nothing like any of the other characters
tyl5_JOLxRE,227599,229599,in the roster because he's you know an
tyl5_JOLxRE,229599,232239,interdimensional being now dropping a
tyl5_JOLxRE,232239,234640,year after lego indiana jones two is
tyl5_JOLxRE,234640,236959,lego harry potter years one to four and
tyl5_JOLxRE,236959,238879,this is actually my most played lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,238879,241280,game when i was younger i love this lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,241280,243319,game and in total they are
tyl5_JOLxRE,243319,246319,167 characters yes granted a lot of the
tyl5_JOLxRE,246319,248319,characters are very very similar because
tyl5_JOLxRE,248319,250720,they all use the same spells and stuff
tyl5_JOLxRE,250720,252799,except from the milkman we like the
tyl5_JOLxRE,252799,255519,milkman so for this one it really could
tyl5_JOLxRE,255519,257600,be any character it really depends on
tyl5_JOLxRE,257600,259759,who you like in the movies but i'm gonna
tyl5_JOLxRE,259759,262320,go for professor lupin now this
tyl5_JOLxRE,262320,264960,character is really severely underrated
tyl5_JOLxRE,264960,267199,in the films and in the lego game he can
tyl5_JOLxRE,267199,269680,transform into a werewolf now some of
tyl5_JOLxRE,269680,271040,you may be like why don't you put
tyl5_JOLxRE,271040,272960,voldemort as the best character to get
tyl5_JOLxRE,272960,275040,voldemort you need to get every single
tyl5_JOLxRE,275040,277520,goldbrick he's a pain to unbox so no
tyl5_JOLxRE,277520,279919,he's not the best because barely anyone
tyl5_JOLxRE,279919,282160,got him though i do have to say tom
tyl5_JOLxRE,282160,283840,riddle is a very strong character
tyl5_JOLxRE,283840,286160,because the rate you can send out spells
tyl5_JOLxRE,286160,289040,is ridiculous like look at him go nick
tyl5_JOLxRE,289040,291919,calm down calm down now the whole reason
tyl5_JOLxRE,291919,294160,why i chose professor lupin is because
tyl5_JOLxRE,294160,296479,he has every single spell like most of
tyl5_JOLxRE,296479,298479,the characters in this game and he can
tyl5_JOLxRE,298479,300960,turn into a werewolf and i really love
tyl5_JOLxRE,300960,302960,the design of the werewolf it's got such
tyl5_JOLxRE,302960,304960,a nostalgic feeling to me because we
tyl5_JOLxRE,304960,306880,haven't really seen this molding of the
tyl5_JOLxRE,306880,309280,werewolf design in any other lego game
tyl5_JOLxRE,309280,311680,are in lego in general now when i was
tyl5_JOLxRE,311680,314240,younger i absolutely loved lego star
tyl5_JOLxRE,314240,316479,wars the complete saga but i preferred
tyl5_JOLxRE,316479,319199,lego star wars 3 the clone wars and that
tyl5_JOLxRE,319199,321600,was the next lego game 2 release after
tyl5_JOLxRE,321600,324400,lego harry potter now for lego star wars
tyl5_JOLxRE,324400,326880,3 i am really debated between a few
tyl5_JOLxRE,326880,328639,characters i mean you've got cabin
tyl5_JOLxRE,328639,331039,general grievous star killer and out of
tyl5_JOLxRE,331039,334080,them three i'm gonna have to say general
tyl5_JOLxRE,334080,336560,grievous now i'm sure a lot of you can
tyl5_JOLxRE,336560,338720,resonate with this one general grievous
tyl5_JOLxRE,338720,340639,has such an intricate design in these
tyl5_JOLxRE,340639,342560,lego star wars games he can literally
tyl5_JOLxRE,342560,345680,hold four light series now that is epic
tyl5_JOLxRE,345680,348560,but but i do have to commend tt games
tyl5_JOLxRE,348560,350720,for adding star killer into this lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,350720,352400,game if you don't know who starkiller is
tyl5_JOLxRE,352400,354400,he's basically vader's apprentice from
tyl5_JOLxRE,354400,357039,the force unleashed games and man did i
tyl5_JOLxRE,357039,358960,love force lightning in this game when i
tyl5_JOLxRE,358960,361120,were younger false lightning in this is
tyl5_JOLxRE,361120,364000,so fun to use and actually thinking
tyl5_JOLxRE,364000,366080,about it in all honesty this one's kind
tyl5_JOLxRE,366080,368080,of a tied one between starkiller and
tyl5_JOLxRE,368080,369759,general grievous he's gonna have to be
tyl5_JOLxRE,369759,372560,it's gonna have to be
tyl5_JOLxRE,373440,375840,oh yeah the next one's lego pirates of
tyl5_JOLxRE,375840,381199,the cavian oh such an underrated lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,385919,388400,now for me the best character in lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,388400,390960,parts of the caribbean is blackbeard i
tyl5_JOLxRE,390960,393440,mean may he can literally shoot red
tyl5_JOLxRE,393440,395360,lightning out of his sword it is
tyl5_JOLxRE,395360,397360,ridiculously overpowered and it just
tyl5_JOLxRE,397360,400000,looks awesome and alongside that look at
tyl5_JOLxRE,400000,402160,the character model that beard piece is
tyl5_JOLxRE,402160,404479,amazing that modeling is
tyl5_JOLxRE,404479,406400,oh yeah and not to forget the move where
tyl5_JOLxRE,406400,408240,you literally pick them up and boot them
tyl5_JOLxRE,408240,411039,into the distance it's amazing now very
tyl5_JOLxRE,411039,412880,similar to lego star wars 3 and i
tyl5_JOLxRE,412880,414960,promise i won't do this again i have to
tyl5_JOLxRE,414960,416880,put captain jack sparrow on this spot
tyl5_JOLxRE,416880,419280,too i mean come on he's captain jack
tyl5_JOLxRE,419280,421840,sparrow and you know what i have to say
tyl5_JOLxRE,421840,424160,this is the best animated character i
tyl5_JOLxRE,424160,426240,have seen out of every single lego game
tyl5_JOLxRE,426240,428319,because it really does perfectly reflect
tyl5_JOLxRE,428319,430400,the acting done by johnny depp who
tyl5_JOLxRE,430400,432319,obviously portrayed the character of
tyl5_JOLxRE,432319,434960,captain jack sparrow i mean look at that
tyl5_JOLxRE,434960,437360,little lego run that is pitch perfect
tyl5_JOLxRE,437360,439599,animation on reflecting the acting done
tyl5_JOLxRE,439599,441759,by johnny depp to portray captain jack
tyl5_JOLxRE,441759,444479,sparrow and he's an amazing actor anyway
tyl5_JOLxRE,444479,446479,it's time to return back to hogwarts and
tyl5_JOLxRE,446479,449440,thinking about it 2011 was an amazing
tyl5_JOLxRE,449440,451199,year for lego games we've got pirates of
tyl5_JOLxRE,451199,453360,the caribbean lego star wars 3 and lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,453360,456560,harry potter years 5-7 now obviously for
tyl5_JOLxRE,456560,459360,lego harry potter years 5-7 i'm going to
tyl5_JOLxRE,459360,461280,have to go with voldemort for this one
tyl5_JOLxRE,461280,463520,and fun fact voldemort in this game is
tyl5_JOLxRE,463520,466080,the most expensive character out of
tyl5_JOLxRE,466080,469599,every single lego game i mean no joke he
tyl5_JOLxRE,469599,473039,literally costs 25 million stunts and
tyl5_JOLxRE,473039,475199,lego harry potter years 5-7 has a
tyl5_JOLxRE,475199,477599,whopping 200 characters granted they are
tyl5_JOLxRE,477599,478960,all very similar because they use the
tyl5_JOLxRE,478960,480879,same spells and stuff and then we jump
tyl5_JOLxRE,480879,483520,to lego batman 2 releasing a year after
tyl5_JOLxRE,483520,485759,and there's only 50 characters in that
tyl5_JOLxRE,485759,488800,game i mean look at it it is tiny now
tyl5_JOLxRE,488800,490800,there is no other answer for this one
tyl5_JOLxRE,490800,494080,the best character in lego batman 2 by
tyl5_JOLxRE,494080,497520,far is superman i mean if you jump back
tyl5_JOLxRE,497520,500400,to 2012 this character was actually
tyl5_JOLxRE,500400,502879,groundbreaking for a lego game he could
tyl5_JOLxRE,502879,504879,fly around he had layers of eyes he had
tyl5_JOLxRE,504879,507039,freeze breath he could blow people back
tyl5_JOLxRE,507039,508960,and he had an absolute awesome theme
tyl5_JOLxRE,508960,510720,when flying around john williams theme
tyl5_JOLxRE,510720,512959,just kicks in as you fly around gotham
tyl5_JOLxRE,512959,515518,city and i absolutely love the design of
tyl5_JOLxRE,515518,517440,superman in this game with the logo on
tyl5_JOLxRE,517440,518880,the back of his cape and we've never
tyl5_JOLxRE,518880,521039,actually seen that returning later lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,521039,523680,games like dc super villains and we all
tyl5_JOLxRE,523680,525200,know that was one of the best
tyl5_JOLxRE,525200,527360,experiences when we were younger flying
tyl5_JOLxRE,527360,529519,around gotham city as superman with john
tyl5_JOLxRE,529519,532000,williams
tyl5_JOLxRE,532839,535600,theme hey it still is as good as you
tyl5_JOLxRE,535600,537920,remember trust me get on a superman and
tyl5_JOLxRE,537920,540399,have a was around gotham city anyway
tyl5_JOLxRE,540399,542720,it's now time to move on to lego lord of
tyl5_JOLxRE,542720,544560,the rings which is one of my all-time
tyl5_JOLxRE,544560,547440,favorite lego games now lego lord of the
tyl5_JOLxRE,547440,550320,rings has a total of 74 characters and i
tyl5_JOLxRE,550320,551600,definitely think this is one of the
tyl5_JOLxRE,551600,553839,weakest aspects of lego lord of the
tyl5_JOLxRE,553839,555839,rings and the main reason for this is
tyl5_JOLxRE,555839,558080,because a lot of the characters do feel
tyl5_JOLxRE,558080,560240,very very similar they either use a
tyl5_JOLxRE,560240,563120,sword or a ball of an axe now i ain't
tyl5_JOLxRE,563120,565760,expecting gimli to start flying around
tyl5_JOLxRE,565760,567839,middle earth i'm not expecting that from
tyl5_JOLxRE,567839,569920,the character roster i'm totally fine
tyl5_JOLxRE,569920,571760,with all the characters in this game so
tyl5_JOLxRE,571760,573440,i think i'm gonna go off the aesthetics
tyl5_JOLxRE,573440,575680,of the characters for this one and i'm
tyl5_JOLxRE,575680,577920,gonna have to go with either the king of
tyl5_JOLxRE,577920,579680,the dead or the witch king but
tyl5_JOLxRE,579680,581519,personally i think i'm gonna go with the
tyl5_JOLxRE,581519,583920,witch king i mean look at the design of
tyl5_JOLxRE,583920,587279,this character it looks absolutely epic
tyl5_JOLxRE,587279,589040,now lego lord of the rings doesn't
tyl5_JOLxRE,589040,591200,really have its uniqueness lying within
tyl5_JOLxRE,591200,593519,the characters it kind of differentiates
tyl5_JOLxRE,593519,595600,itself upon other lego games with its
tyl5_JOLxRE,595600,598640,miffle weapons and items
tyl5_JOLxRE,598640,600560,we all know the best thing out of their
tyl5_JOLxRE,600560,602640,mythical weapons it's definitely the
tyl5_JOLxRE,602640,605120,discord file
tyl5_JOLxRE,605120,612160,[Music]
tyl5_JOLxRE,612160,613839,and then it's time to move from middle
tyl5_JOLxRE,613839,616480,earth to lego city with lego city
tyl5_JOLxRE,616480,619600,undercover now technically in lego city
tyl5_JOLxRE,619600,622480,undercover they are 305 characters but
tyl5_JOLxRE,622480,624959,they actually all work as disguises for
tyl5_JOLxRE,624959,627600,chase mccain so collectively they all
tyl5_JOLxRE,627600,629839,add up to be one character if you get
tyl5_JOLxRE,629839,631360,where i'm coming from it's gonna have to
tyl5_JOLxRE,631360,633760,be chase mcgee and dropping the exact
tyl5_JOLxRE,633760,636160,same year as lego city undercover was
tyl5_JOLxRE,636160,638560,the best-selling lego game ever and i'm
tyl5_JOLxRE,638560,640640,sure you've all played it it's lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,640640,645680,marvel superheroes now lego marvel 1 has
tyl5_JOLxRE,645680,647279,characters and this is the hardest one
tyl5_JOLxRE,647279,649040,on the list because the character roster
tyl5_JOLxRE,649040,652240,is so solid except from damage control
tyl5_JOLxRE,652240,654480,and absorbing my make you can't absorb
tyl5_JOLxRE,654480,656480,nothing what is the point in you it's
tyl5_JOLxRE,656480,658959,just some bold block with a mace that is
tyl5_JOLxRE,658959,661440,literally all he is so for this one the
tyl5_JOLxRE,661440,664399,best character has to go to deadpool i
tyl5_JOLxRE,664399,666720,mean for starters you cannot defeat this
tyl5_JOLxRE,666720,668480,character whenever you kill him he turns
tyl5_JOLxRE,668480,670480,into a skeleton and just regenerates
tyl5_JOLxRE,670480,672160,back like he does in the films and the
tyl5_JOLxRE,672160,675040,comics and the character even breaks the
tyl5_JOLxRE,675040,677440,fourth wall kind of in this lego game he
tyl5_JOLxRE,677440,679360,has like a special move where he uses
tyl5_JOLxRE,679360,681519,features from lego games to defeat his
tyl5_JOLxRE,681519,683839,enemies it's pretty cool now yeah there
tyl5_JOLxRE,683839,686000,are tons of other amazing characters in
tyl5_JOLxRE,686000,688240,lego marvel ones such as stan lee
tyl5_JOLxRE,688240,690959,magneto professor x and all these
tyl5_JOLxRE,690959,692959,favorites from the comics i'm gonna have
tyl5_JOLxRE,692959,694480,to go with deadpool on this one because
tyl5_JOLxRE,694480,696640,we've never seen deadpool return in
tyl5_JOLxRE,696640,698959,other lego marvel games and it's a treat
tyl5_JOLxRE,698959,701360,to have and lego marvel one and i'm sure
tyl5_JOLxRE,701360,703279,this resonates with a few of you too
tyl5_JOLxRE,703279,705040,actually made me fall in love with
tyl5_JOLxRE,705040,707519,deadpool because this was 2013 and then
tyl5_JOLxRE,707519,710480,in 2016 we obviously got the amazing
tyl5_JOLxRE,710480,712959,deadpool movie now it's time to move on
tyl5_JOLxRE,712959,715279,to where everything is awesome it's lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,715279,716959,movie the video game and i'm not a
tyl5_JOLxRE,716959,719040,massive fan of this lego game actually i
tyl5_JOLxRE,719040,721279,played it a lot when i was younger but
tyl5_JOLxRE,721279,723200,i'm not a massive fan of it anymore but
tyl5_JOLxRE,723200,724880,i think for the best cabbage time we
tyl5_JOLxRE,724880,726639,have to go with lord business he's just
tyl5_JOLxRE,726639,729120,a lego character walking man with super
tyl5_JOLxRE,729120,731600,glue like what now yeah i am aware it's
tyl5_JOLxRE,731600,733760,the craggle the most powerful weapon in
tyl5_JOLxRE,733760,736480,lego movie lore and to be fair it is
tyl5_JOLxRE,736480,738800,pretty overpowered you can super glue
tyl5_JOLxRE,738800,740639,everyone around you i've never thought i
tyl5_JOLxRE,740639,742880,would ever say that in my life but hey
tyl5_JOLxRE,742880,744720,you can do and then obviously lord
tyl5_JOLxRE,744720,747440,business can pull out his long legs with
tyl5_JOLxRE,747440,749600,them stupid stations and all you can do
tyl5_JOLxRE,749600,751600,is just kick people isn't there's no
tyl5_JOLxRE,751600,753360,really point in them i guess it's the
tyl5_JOLxRE,753360,755360,coolest character in the game now pretty
tyl5_JOLxRE,755360,757279,much the lego movie character roster
tyl5_JOLxRE,757279,759600,he's just a massive crossover you've got
tyl5_JOLxRE,759600,761839,gandalf in there superman in there
tyl5_JOLxRE,761839,763920,batman green lantern all these
tyl5_JOLxRE,763920,765519,characters and then you've got lord
tyl5_JOLxRE,765519,768079,business with super glue he is the best
tyl5_JOLxRE,768079,770000,come on it's the quagga and dropping the
tyl5_JOLxRE,770000,771920,same year as the lego movie game it's
tyl5_JOLxRE,771920,775760,time to go far over the misty mountains
tyl5_JOLxRE,775760,777680,to lego the hobbit it's actually one of
tyl5_JOLxRE,777680,779839,the worst rated lego games this one and
tyl5_JOLxRE,779839,781680,you know what i don't know why it is
tyl5_JOLxRE,781680,783600,rated one of the worst lego games i
tyl5_JOLxRE,783600,785040,think it's because it just dropped out
tyl5_JOLxRE,785040,786720,of nowhere and they actually didn't
tyl5_JOLxRE,786720,788560,finish the trilogy even though they
tyl5_JOLxRE,788560,790720,promised to you only can play the first
tyl5_JOLxRE,790720,792480,two hobbit movies i think that's the
tyl5_JOLxRE,792480,794880,main reason why and i think for this one
tyl5_JOLxRE,794880,796639,i'm gonna have to go with the goblin
tyl5_JOLxRE,796639,798959,king he's got a really awesome design
tyl5_JOLxRE,798959,800880,and he's absolutely massive in the game
tyl5_JOLxRE,800880,801920,and you just feel like you're playing
tyl5_JOLxRE,801920,804160,some massive boss whenever you beat now
tyl5_JOLxRE,804160,806320,as an honorable mention i'm going to put
tyl5_JOLxRE,806320,808079,board on the list i think that's how you
tyl5_JOLxRE,808079,810160,say his name gone is that is that it i
tyl5_JOLxRE,810160,811920,don't really remember the hobbit all too
tyl5_JOLxRE,811920,813760,vaguely i'm more into lord of the rings
tyl5_JOLxRE,813760,815920,but this character can turn himself into
tyl5_JOLxRE,815920,818000,a bear and the animation for that
tyl5_JOLxRE,818000,820480,process is really wicked you know it's
tyl5_JOLxRE,820480,822880,all about the burn necessities actually
tyl5_JOLxRE,822880,824800,imagine a lego jungle book game that'd
tyl5_JOLxRE,824800,827440,be sweet dropping just after lego the
tyl5_JOLxRE,827440,830399,hobbit in the same year is lego batman 3
tyl5_JOLxRE,830399,832720,way beyond gotham as i like to call it
tyl5_JOLxRE,832720,834639,because of them stupid planets i mean
tyl5_JOLxRE,834639,837040,come on who likes the planets but hey
tyl5_JOLxRE,837040,839839,hey you know what lego batman 3 actually
tyl5_JOLxRE,839839,841839,has one of the best character rosters i
tyl5_JOLxRE,841839,843920,reckon out of every single lego game
tyl5_JOLxRE,843920,846079,it's super solid now there's a lot of
tyl5_JOLxRE,846079,847680,wacky characters in this one you've got
tyl5_JOLxRE,847680,849920,the music meister you've got daffy duck
tyl5_JOLxRE,849920,851440,as the green loom turn you've got
tyl5_JOLxRE,851440,853760,atrocities with an absolute incredible
tyl5_JOLxRE,853760,855760,slamming move well you know what out of
tyl5_JOLxRE,855760,857440,all these characters i'm gonna have to
tyl5_JOLxRE,857440,860000,give it to batman 1966.
tyl5_JOLxRE,860000,862160,and you can really see from the devs a
tyl5_JOLxRE,862160,864079,lot of love went into this character
tyl5_JOLxRE,864079,866240,because one you have adam west voicing
tyl5_JOLxRE,866240,867839,the character who originally played
tyl5_JOLxRE,867839,870320,batman from 1966
tyl5_JOLxRE,870320,872000,and i have to say i love all the
tyl5_JOLxRE,872000,873680,references they fitted into this
tyl5_JOLxRE,873680,875680,character's movesets referencing the old
tyl5_JOLxRE,875680,878320,classic tv show such as the bat bomb
tyl5_JOLxRE,878320,880240,seriously when he runs with the bat bomb
tyl5_JOLxRE,880240,881760,it is exactly like what he does in the
tyl5_JOLxRE,881760,884079,classic tv show i'll put a comparison up
tyl5_JOLxRE,884079,886000,so you can see and not to forget the
tyl5_JOLxRE,886000,888720,fantastic bonus level too and like i
tyl5_JOLxRE,888720,890079,mentioned there's a lot of good
tyl5_JOLxRE,890079,892000,characters in lego batman 3 you've got
tyl5_JOLxRE,892000,894600,daffy duck has green loom too but batman
tyl5_JOLxRE,894600,898079,1966 is such a cool character and i love
tyl5_JOLxRE,898079,900000,the way he sneaks around with his cape
tyl5_JOLxRE,900000,901920,like what he did in the classic tv show
tyl5_JOLxRE,901920,903519,it's a shame we don't have that stupid
tyl5_JOLxRE,903519,905040,dance from one of the episodes like what
tyl5_JOLxRE,905040,907199,they reference in the lego batman movie
tyl5_JOLxRE,907199,908560,you know what let's have a classic
tyl5_JOLxRE,908560,910839,batman transition on to the next
tyl5_JOLxRE,910839,914000,one time to look at jurassic world now
tyl5_JOLxRE,914000,916240,i'm gonna spare no expense with this one
tyl5_JOLxRE,916240,918639,they are a few decent characters in the
tyl5_JOLxRE,918639,920720,character roster mind you everyone just
tyl5_JOLxRE,920720,922720,cares about the dinosaurs but i do like
tyl5_JOLxRE,922720,925839,mr dna john hammond and jeff goldblum
tyl5_JOLxRE,925839,928320,pretty much now if you're going off the
tyl5_JOLxRE,928320,931279,character roster technically the t-rex
tyl5_JOLxRE,931279,932880,counts as part of the roster so i'm
tyl5_JOLxRE,932880,934639,gonna have to give the t-rex this one i
tyl5_JOLxRE,934639,936800,mean it's a t-rex it's the staple of the
tyl5_JOLxRE,936800,939199,jurassic park franchise and actually i
tyl5_JOLxRE,939199,940959,forgot how you can customize your own
tyl5_JOLxRE,940959,943199,dinosaur in this lego game it really is
tyl5_JOLxRE,943199,945440,an underrated lego game now we're going
tyl5_JOLxRE,945440,947519,from an underrated lego game to the most
tyl5_JOLxRE,947519,950639,expensive lego game it's lego dimensions
tyl5_JOLxRE,950639,953040,now dimensions is a massive crossover
tyl5_JOLxRE,953040,955199,lego game you've got sonic doctor who
tyl5_JOLxRE,955199,957040,and all these the gremlins mission
tyl5_JOLxRE,957040,959120,impossible but for me i think you get
tyl5_JOLxRE,959120,961519,the most value for money with doctor who
tyl5_JOLxRE,961519,964079,now dimensions is a really really hard
tyl5_JOLxRE,964079,965759,one because it is really down to
tyl5_JOLxRE,965759,967519,personal preference heavily with this
tyl5_JOLxRE,967519,969040,gamer you've got harry potter and all
tyl5_JOLxRE,969040,971440,these franchises but for me i'm gonna go
tyl5_JOLxRE,971440,973360,with doctor who that's my personal one
tyl5_JOLxRE,973360,974720,please let me know your favorite
tyl5_JOLxRE,974720,976880,character from lego dimensions below
tyl5_JOLxRE,976880,980079,jumping onto the year of 2016 along with
tyl5_JOLxRE,980079,983360,lego dimensions was lego avengers and we
tyl5_JOLxRE,983360,985199,have to give it to one of the greatest
tyl5_JOLxRE,985199,988079,lego game characters of all time stan
tyl5_JOLxRE,988079,990079,lee now stan lee was such an
tyl5_JOLxRE,990079,992399,extraordinary man writing all the comics
tyl5_JOLxRE,992399,994240,he really is amazing and rested peace
tyl5_JOLxRE,994240,995920,stan lee and he's one of the best
tyl5_JOLxRE,995920,997759,characters throughout every single lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,997759,999680,marvel game i didn't give it him in lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,999680,1001199,marvel superheroes one because i do
tyl5_JOLxRE,1001199,1003360,think deadpool is the staple in that one
tyl5_JOLxRE,1003360,1006160,but in lego avengers stan lee is at his
tyl5_JOLxRE,1006160,1008880,best well let me just begin with the man
tyl5_JOLxRE,1008880,1011680,can shoot pencils from a boar he also
tyl5_JOLxRE,1011680,1014160,has a hulk buster he has an iron stan
tyl5_JOLxRE,1014160,1016160,outfit and the name is just amazing on
tyl5_JOLxRE,1016160,1018399,its own he could turn into the hulk he
tyl5_JOLxRE,1018399,1020639,has super speed and he can swing around
tyl5_JOLxRE,1020639,1023519,the city like daredevil and finally he
tyl5_JOLxRE,1023519,1026000,has a shield that is made of stan
tyl5_JOLxRE,1026000,1028640,branium i mean i'm sorry but john wick
tyl5_JOLxRE,1028640,1031038,has nothing on me i'm out here shooting
tyl5_JOLxRE,1031038,1032880,people with pencils left right and
tyl5_JOLxRE,1032880,1035600,center just destroying everything now
tyl5_JOLxRE,1035600,1038240,stan lee in lego avengers may be the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1038240,1041280,greatest lego game character of all time
tyl5_JOLxRE,1041280,1044079,i'm not even joking anyway next up in
tyl5_JOLxRE,1044079,1047120,the same year of 2016 is my least
tyl5_JOLxRE,1047120,1049360,favorite lego game lego star wars the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1049360,1052080,force awakens but saying that i love
tyl5_JOLxRE,1052080,1054559,every single lego game and for this one
tyl5_JOLxRE,1054559,1056400,i'm gonna have to give it to the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1056400,1059360,inquisitor from the rebels dlc pack now
tyl5_JOLxRE,1059360,1060799,the one thing i love about this
tyl5_JOLxRE,1060799,1062720,character is how you can glide with the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1062720,1064960,lightsaber or technically fly with it
tyl5_JOLxRE,1064960,1066880,now say what you want about that some of
tyl5_JOLxRE,1066880,1068240,you may like it or something you might
tyl5_JOLxRE,1068240,1070559,not do but in a lego game it's fine it's
tyl5_JOLxRE,1070559,1072480,totally fine and i really love the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1072480,1075120,entire overall design of the inquisitor
tyl5_JOLxRE,1075120,1076640,in this game and i wish we got to see
tyl5_JOLxRE,1076640,1078480,the inquisitor returning lego stalls to
tyl5_JOLxRE,1078480,1080400,skywalker saga this is the only lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,1080400,1083600,game to have an inquisitor anyway moving
tyl5_JOLxRE,1083600,1085760,on we have lego worlds which dropped in
tyl5_JOLxRE,1085760,1088559,the year of 2017 and really is a mixed
tyl5_JOLxRE,1088559,1090559,bag upon the lego game community because
tyl5_JOLxRE,1090559,1093200,it's a sandbox lego game and personally
tyl5_JOLxRE,1093200,1095600,i love building and designing stuff so i
tyl5_JOLxRE,1095600,1098640,rather enjoy lego worlds but saying that
tyl5_JOLxRE,1098640,1101200,it is quite a buggy lego game now i
tyl5_JOLxRE,1101200,1103120,think for my favorite character from
tyl5_JOLxRE,1103120,1104720,lego world i'm going to have to go with
tyl5_JOLxRE,1104720,1107120,the anubis god because i absolutely love
tyl5_JOLxRE,1107120,1109200,egyptian mythology and i mean look at
tyl5_JOLxRE,1109200,1111120,the lego character
tyl5_JOLxRE,1111120,1113440,look at it right now just to warn you
tyl5_JOLxRE,1113440,1115360,the next character on our list is
tyl5_JOLxRE,1115360,1117679,probably the most stupid character on
tyl5_JOLxRE,1117679,1119200,our entire list but he's one of the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1119200,1121600,greatest characters ever it's the hot
tyl5_JOLxRE,1121600,1124720,dog man from the lego ninjago movie game
tyl5_JOLxRE,1124720,1126799,now what makes this character so
tyl5_JOLxRE,1126799,1128960,exquisite in this game is how everyone
tyl5_JOLxRE,1128960,1131200,else is a ninja using swords and they're
tyl5_JOLxRE,1131200,1133600,really acrobatic and my man's in a hot
tyl5_JOLxRE,1133600,1135679,dog outfit with a mustard gun and a
tyl5_JOLxRE,1135679,1137600,ketchup gun and he's taking on every
tyl5_JOLxRE,1137600,1139760,ninja going yeah i wasn't even joking
tyl5_JOLxRE,1139760,1141840,he's literally john wick in a hot dog
tyl5_JOLxRE,1141840,1143760,outfit look at him dashing from left to
tyl5_JOLxRE,1143760,1145600,right with all his moves and sending
tyl5_JOLxRE,1145600,1148320,people up into air now the lego ninjago
tyl5_JOLxRE,1148320,1150160,movie game is probably one of the most
tyl5_JOLxRE,1150160,1152720,forgotten lego games and not many people
tyl5_JOLxRE,1152720,1155120,played it but the hot dog man is worth
tyl5_JOLxRE,1155120,1157120,it when you unlock this guy the game
tyl5_JOLxRE,1157120,1159760,changes it goes from a five to a ten and
tyl5_JOLxRE,1159760,1161840,just so you appreciate this caveat i'm
tyl5_JOLxRE,1161840,1163120,going to let you look at him for two
tyl5_JOLxRE,1163120,1165840,seconds
tyl5_JOLxRE,1166160,1168480,there you go anyway next up is lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,1168480,1171200,marvel 2 dropping in the year of 2017
tyl5_JOLxRE,1171200,1173120,alongside lego worlds and the lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,1173120,1175039,ninjago game they really pumped out
tyl5_JOLxRE,1175039,1177280,quite a lot of lego games that year now

tyl5_JOLxRE,1182880,1186240,beloved mcu favorites and not to forget

tyl5_JOLxRE,1189200,1190960,who was actually originally made for
tyl5_JOLxRE,1190960,1192720,lego marvel 2 and that was his first
tyl5_JOLxRE,1192720,1194640,appearance he's a mix between obviously
tyl5_JOLxRE,1194640,1197120,carnage and venom now personally for me
tyl5_JOLxRE,1197120,1199280,because i'm a massive fan of 80s music
tyl5_JOLxRE,1199280,1201360,and all that stuff my favorite character
tyl5_JOLxRE,1201360,1204240,has to go to starlord who
tyl5_JOLxRE,1204240,1207360,well star-lord man legendary outlaw
tyl5_JOLxRE,1207360,1209919,now if you have played lego marvel 2 i'm

tyl5_JOLxRE,1216320,1218240,he's one of the funnest characters to
tyl5_JOLxRE,1218240,1221360,play and when i 100 this game i found
tyl5_JOLxRE,1221360,1223760,myself being star lord over and over
tyl5_JOLxRE,1223760,1225440,again because it's just so much fun
tyl5_JOLxRE,1225440,1227280,walking around with a walkman blasting

tyl5_JOLxRE,1235440,1237200,the infinity gauntlet you've got this

tyl5_JOLxRE,1240080,1242000,knight who is really awesome and he can
tyl5_JOLxRE,1242000,1244080,pull out a little guitar and sing you a
tyl5_JOLxRE,1244080,1246000,song but yeah i'm gonna have to give it
tyl5_JOLxRE,1246000,1247679,star-lord on this one and he's one of
tyl5_JOLxRE,1247679,1249760,the best characters in the mcu tune i
tyl5_JOLxRE,1249760,1252320,mean come on it's star-lord man next up
tyl5_JOLxRE,1252320,1254400,we have lego incredibles and we have to
tyl5_JOLxRE,1254400,1256400,play the incredibles theme song for this
tyl5_JOLxRE,1256400,1259440,one cue the music now lego incredibles
tyl5_JOLxRE,1259440,1261600,is so much remembered for adding all
tyl5_JOLxRE,1261600,1263760,these beloved pixar characters such as
tyl5_JOLxRE,1263760,1266480,woody from toy story sully from monsters
tyl5_JOLxRE,1266480,1269360,inc wally and even then the actual
tyl5_JOLxRE,1269360,1271760,incredible family have all really done
tyl5_JOLxRE,1271760,1274080,well especially mr incredible being able
tyl5_JOLxRE,1274080,1276320,to barge cars out the way it's just a
tyl5_JOLxRE,1276320,1279440,unit and out of lego incredibles really
tyl5_JOLxRE,1279440,1281039,solid character roster and all these
tyl5_JOLxRE,1281039,1283919,pixar characters such as ratatouille
tyl5_JOLxRE,1283919,1286000,but you know what i think the best
tyl5_JOLxRE,1286000,1288720,character is gonna have to go to warley
tyl5_JOLxRE,1288720,1290880,now we have never actually seen a
tyl5_JOLxRE,1290880,1293120,character like wally done before in a
tyl5_JOLxRE,1293120,1295440,lego game he's such a weird character to
tyl5_JOLxRE,1295440,1298080,put into a lego game but they absolutely
tyl5_JOLxRE,1298080,1300320,nailed the overall look of wally and the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1300320,1302320,aesthetics of the character and he's
tyl5_JOLxRE,1302320,1304159,super fun to play and when you play him
tyl5_JOLxRE,1304159,1307120,he's really fluid and now this may sound
tyl5_JOLxRE,1307120,1309520,strange but wally is actually the most
tyl5_JOLxRE,1309520,1312480,violent lego game character seriously he
tyl5_JOLxRE,1312480,1314400,turns you into trash he literally puts
tyl5_JOLxRE,1314400,1316400,you inside of him compacts you up and
tyl5_JOLxRE,1316400,1318400,spits you back out as a cube of trash
tyl5_JOLxRE,1318400,1320720,that is pretty brutal i mean wally's
tyl5_JOLxRE,1320720,1323039,been through some stuff yeah he's taking
tyl5_JOLxRE,1323039,1324960,it out on people now he's a bit brutal
tyl5_JOLxRE,1324960,1327280,watch out but in all honesty i could
tyl5_JOLxRE,1327280,1329679,literally give this entire category to
tyl5_JOLxRE,1329679,1331679,all of the pixar characters because the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1331679,1333919,pixar characters are phenomenal we'd
tyl5_JOLxRE,1333919,1336159,really need a lego pixar game i mean a
tyl5_JOLxRE,1336159,1338960,lego toy story one would be the dream
tyl5_JOLxRE,1338960,1341679,lego dc super villains is up next and
tyl5_JOLxRE,1341679,1343919,this seriously is one of the best lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,1343919,1345679,games i have ever played if you have not
tyl5_JOLxRE,1345679,1347919,played dc super villains hey what you're
tyl5_JOLxRE,1347919,1350640,doing get playing it i mean mark hamill
tyl5_JOLxRE,1350640,1352799,who literally voices the joker in the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1352799,1354799,arkham games alongside the animated
tyl5_JOLxRE,1354799,1356880,series voices joker in this one too
tyl5_JOLxRE,1356880,1359520,alongside kevin conroy as batman and
tyl5_JOLxRE,1359520,1361360,this is one of the best grounded
tyl5_JOLxRE,1361360,1363440,character rosters i have ever seen in a
tyl5_JOLxRE,1363440,1365679,lego game a lot of the characters really
tyl5_JOLxRE,1365679,1367600,do feel unique and their abilities
tyl5_JOLxRE,1367600,1369200,aren't just copied and pasted between
tyl5_JOLxRE,1369200,1371280,them with different coloured lasers they
tyl5_JOLxRE,1371280,1374159,are all actually pretty fleshed out so
tyl5_JOLxRE,1374159,1375760,for this one i'm gonna give it to
tyl5_JOLxRE,1375760,1378080,darkseid and what makes this character
tyl5_JOLxRE,1378080,1380480,so good is just his entire moveset and
tyl5_JOLxRE,1380480,1383520,how fluid he is to play i mean his most
tyl5_JOLxRE,1383520,1385760,iconic movies is all mega beams and in
tyl5_JOLxRE,1385760,1388240,this lego game you can seriously control
tyl5_JOLxRE,1388240,1390000,where the omega beams go and they just
tyl5_JOLxRE,1390000,1392159,look immaculate in the air just moving
tyl5_JOLxRE,1392159,1394400,around like they do in the films and i
tyl5_JOLxRE,1394400,1396320,love the move where he grabs an enemy
tyl5_JOLxRE,1396320,1398080,and just starts slamming a rock onto
tyl5_JOLxRE,1398080,1399840,them multiple times that is pretty
tyl5_JOLxRE,1399840,1401760,brutal but now it's time to move into
tyl5_JOLxRE,1401760,1404320,the year of 2019 and this was the most
tyl5_JOLxRE,1404320,1406080,recent lego game today until the
tyl5_JOLxRE,1406080,1409120,skywalker saga and that was lego movie 2
tyl5_JOLxRE,1409120,1411120,and this is one of the most hated lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,1411120,1413919,games but i enjoy it but it definitely
tyl5_JOLxRE,1413919,1416400,is in the bottom half definitely
tyl5_JOLxRE,1416400,1418559,now the character roster in this game is
tyl5_JOLxRE,1418559,1421200,so disappointing and the main reason for
tyl5_JOLxRE,1421200,1423360,this is it has some really awesome
tyl5_JOLxRE,1423360,1425679,designs on characters such as sistarian
tyl5_JOLxRE,1425679,1428400,batman and all these crazy outfits but
tyl5_JOLxRE,1428400,1430000,none of the characters have any special
tyl5_JOLxRE,1430000,1433039,abilities at all and yeah the characters
tyl5_JOLxRE,1433039,1435200,don't even work as characters they work
tyl5_JOLxRE,1435200,1437360,as outfits they don't change any of your
tyl5_JOLxRE,1437360,1440159,move sets they are just simply cosmetics
tyl5_JOLxRE,1440159,1442000,and then you've got the creepy lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,1442000,1444240,friend characters who don't really work
tyl5_JOLxRE,1444240,1446080,in a lego game i do think the animation
tyl5_JOLxRE,1446080,1447679,they did a good job on it they're super
tyl5_JOLxRE,1447679,1450320,funny to watch so really for this lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,1450320,1452080,game i'm gonna have to go off cosmetics
tyl5_JOLxRE,1452080,1454000,and i'm gonna give it to batman because
tyl5_JOLxRE,1454000,1456159,it's batman i really can't do a best
tyl5_JOLxRE,1456159,1457760,character for this lego game because
tyl5_JOLxRE,1457760,1459520,literally like i mentioned they're just
tyl5_JOLxRE,1459520,1460960,they're just outfits they're not
tyl5_JOLxRE,1460960,1462960,characters but now it's time to move on
tyl5_JOLxRE,1462960,1465200,to the last of our list and that is lego
tyl5_JOLxRE,1465200,1467440,star wars the skywalker song which has a
tyl5_JOLxRE,1467440,1470080,lot of characters like 420 if you have
tyl5_JOLxRE,1470080,1473039,all the dlcs now this one for me is
tyl5_JOLxRE,1473039,1475039,really really difficult because i kind
tyl5_JOLxRE,1475039,1477200,of want to put a soccer here but a lot
tyl5_JOLxRE,1477200,1479120,of the dlc characters don't have any
tyl5_JOLxRE,1479120,1481279,voicelands and ahsoka is done really
tyl5_JOLxRE,1481279,1483279,well she's the only character has dual
tyl5_JOLxRE,1483279,1485600,wielding lightsabers and she's really
tyl5_JOLxRE,1485600,1488159,fun to use then you've got the likes of
tyl5_JOLxRE,1488159,1491120,the mandalorian with baby gorgon but
tyl5_JOLxRE,1491120,1492960,yeah i think i'm gonna stick with a saw
tyl5_JOLxRE,1492960,1495039,katana because she's the most unique
tyl5_JOLxRE,1495039,1497279,character in this new lego star wars
tyl5_JOLxRE,1497279,1499120,game and the main reason for this is
tyl5_JOLxRE,1499120,1501120,because she due wields lightsabers they
tyl5_JOLxRE,1501120,1503200,had to build an entirely new move set
tyl5_JOLxRE,1503200,1505279,for this character so it really makes
tyl5_JOLxRE,1505279,1508159,her feel unique but anyway i do hope you
tyl5_JOLxRE,1508159,1510000,went to enjoy today's video going
tyl5_JOLxRE,1510000,1511679,through all of the lego games and it may
