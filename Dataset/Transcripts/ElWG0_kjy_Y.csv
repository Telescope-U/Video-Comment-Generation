ElWG0_kjy_Y,6480,10719,Some people are disappointed when they first  see the most famous painting in the world.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,11680,16080,At first glance it doesn't have the wow  factor that other paintings in the Louvre have.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,17040,22000,"It lacks drama. But if we can ignore  the hundreds of people that surround her,"
ElWG0_kjy_Y,22413,27293,if we can turn down the volume and  just push the off button for a second.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,28960,41600,"What we actually see is a  quiet - contemplative painting.    The greatest psychological portrait ever painted.  A portrait so ahead of its time that centuries later,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,41600,48079,we are still trying to figure it out. The  Mona Lisa however is not just the most famous  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,48080,54631,"painting in the world, it is also the source  of innumerable myths legends and supposition."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,81920,90000,"In 1516, the 22 year old french king Francis  the first offered leonardo a job: Court painter  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,90000,98479,"Engineer and Architect to the king. Leonardo, now in  his sixties, moved to the chateau D'Amboise in France  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,99120,105440,and never went back to italy. The young king  and Leonardo would form a deep friendship  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,106800,112720,and the artist was given the king's royal summer  home Close Lucé where he lived for the last  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,112720,120400,"three years of his life - doing what he loved best,  learning and creating. He worked on architectural  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,120400,126560,"plans for a royal residence in central France,  and one of his masterpieces of this period is  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,126560,133040,"the double helix stairway at Chambord. He brought  dozens of notebooks like these with him to France,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,134160,139760,"but he also brought the Mona Lisa.  Leonardo knew how important it was,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,139760,147519,he knew it was a masterpiece - and he would continue  to work on the painting until his death in 1519.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,148800,153520,Mona Lisa is the end product of the  greatest inquisitive mind in history.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,154320,163440,Leonardo anticipated theories by both Galileo and  Newton. His anatomical drawings are unparalleled  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,163440,170640,as are his botanical studies. His treatise on painting  explored radical new ideas - as we shall see.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,171680,176959,"He designed war machines, he used fossils  to disprove biblical accounts of the flood,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,177520,183545,and he had the skill to open the still-beating  heart of a pig to explain how ventricles work.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,184141,189680,He was a man for whom science and art are  complementary rather than distinct disciplines.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,190640,197541,"He believed that ideas formulated in one  realm could - and should, inform the other.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,198160,207656,"He would take all his scientific  knowledge and apply it to the Mona Lisa,    a portrait of an ordinary woman  that he would transform into a myth."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,212240,223840,"Often called ""the first art historian""  Giorgio Vasari published his book about    the Renaissance artists in 1550, and in it, he  wrote the very first account of the painting:  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,225200,232800,"""Leonardo undertook to execute for Francesco  del Giacondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa - his wife""  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,233920,240800,There has always been a dispute about Mona Lisa's  true identity. But in 2005 a German scholar found  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,240800,246960,a handwritten comment in the margins of a 15th  century book in Heidelberg university's library.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,248320,256959,"It was dated october 1503 and was by Agostini  Vespucci, the secretary of Nicolo Machiavelli,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,256959,263120,"the writer of ""The Prince"" and a good friend  of Leonardo. Vespucci notes that ""Leonardo was  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,263120,270560,"painting a portrait of Lisa del Giacondo"".  This is an eyewitness account that firmly establishes  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,270560,276480,not only the identity of Mona Lisa but also the  date when leonardo was working on the portrait.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,281280,288720,Lisa Gherardini married Francesco del  Giacondo in 1495. She was 15 and he was 30.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,290000,297360,Francesco was a nouveau riche silk merchant.  And Lisa was from an old noble family - with no money.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,297360,302560,"She had five children with him and lived  a long, and it seems happy life. One of the  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,302560,308400,"great mysteries is why Leonardo, who was used to  painting for royalty and Popes, painted the wife of  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,308400,317759,"a bourgeois merchant? Family connections - Leonardo's  father Ser Pierro da Vinci was Francesco's lawyer, "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,317760,322960,and it was probably pressure from his father that  made Leonardo take on such a small commission.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,323760,329840,"But i think Leonardo painted her because he wanted  to paint a relatively ordinary woman, to try out  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,329840,336320,new ideas without the fear of interference. It gave him the unusual opportunity to put all he  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,336320,343120,knew about science and the poetry of painting into  the commission. Mona lisa would become a vehicle  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,343120,351440,"for all that he knew. This high resolution scan  taken by art technician Pascal Cotte in 2004,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,351440,357760,"revealed that there is a similar sketch underneath,  reconstructed here as to how it might look.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,358720,365840,"The pose looks the same, and it is quite possible  that this is the face of the real Mona Lisa.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,367440,374400,Leonardo worked on the painting for 16 years.  Knowing that it is Lisa del Giacondo gives us more  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,374400,380720,"information to work with. One example is, because  we have Francesco's will, we know that Lisa owned  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,380720,387680,"a large amount of jewelry, that is not shown in the  painting and that - as we shall see - is significant.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,389040,394240,We can be sure that the mona lisa IS  Lisa del Giocondo from Florence.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,398560,403840,"To say that aspects of the Mona Lisa are just  ""happy accidents"" that he just painted and ""hoped  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,403840,409120,"for the best"" is to deny all the evidence of a  lifetime spent experimenting with techniques,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,409680,416479,"dissecting human bodies, and collecting scientific  and geological data. For a painting with such a  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,416480,424240,huge impact it is surprisingly small at  77 by 53 centimeters or 30 inches by 21 
ElWG0_kjy_Y,427760,433997,"For Mona Lisa Leonardo used a thin grain of  poplar tree and applied an undercoat of lead white,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,434089,440720,rather than just a mix of chalk and pigment.  He wanted a reflective base. Leonardo painted with  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,440720,446720,"semi-transparent glazes that had a very small  amount of pigment mixed with the oil, so how  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,446720,452880,"dark you wanted your glaze to be, depends on how  much pigment you use. He used more like a ""wash"",  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,452880,459920,which he applied thin - layer by layer. Here you  can see two colours of contrast - light and dark.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,459920,465520,When you apply thin glaze over both of them  you can see it starts to unify the contrast but  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,465520,471280,also brings depth and luminosity. The lead white  undercoat reflects the light back through the  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,471280,476480,"glazes, giving the picture more depth and  in essence, lighting Mona Lisa from within.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,477600,481200,As we move around the painting  that light shifts around.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,483760,496880,"This microscopic cross section is  taken from another Leonardo painting.    The first layer is the lead white ground.  Layer two is known as ""Imprimatura"". This layer gives the  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,496880,503120,painting a transparent toned ground which will  allow light falling onto the painting to reflect  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,503120,508639,through the paint layers. The imprimatura  became widely used during the Renaissance.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,509760,515680,Then we have a dark glaze - and that is followed  by various layers of different coloured glazes.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,516560,523200,Scientific analysis shows us that Leonardo used  up to 30 different layers of painted glaze on the  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,523200,531840,"Mona Lisa, applied so thinly that it only totals  40 micrometers of paint! That's half the width  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,531840,538800,"of a human hair. All of these layers applied  differently, with varying amounts of pigments  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,538800,545360,"refract the light in unique ways. He used tiny,  almost invisible brush strokes applied super  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,545360,552880,slowly over months - or in Mona Lisa's case years.  By contrast on her skin the brush strokes were  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,552880,558160,applied in an irregular way - and that makes  the grain of the skin look more lifelike.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,559680,565600,"He also used the ""Verdaccio"" technique. We  see it here on one of his unfinished works.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,566400,572800,He would use green as a base color to produce  nuanced flesh tones. If you look down at your  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,572800,577480,own hands there is a surprising amount of  green showing through the skin.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,578557,586160,"This infrared image taken in 2004 by the Louvre, tells  us a lot about his techniques and use of paint.   "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,586160,594959,"We know the Mona Lisa was meticulously created - nothing was  accidental. A technique he pioneered is ""Chiaroscuro"",  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,594960,601717,where he contrasts prominent shades of light and  dark to create the illusion of three-dimensional forms.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,602130,608000,"Along with this, Leonardo used the ""Sfumato""  technique, which he is credited as inventing.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,608720,614801,"Sfumato means ""smokey"" and it is a blending technique  for softening the transition between colours.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,615260,621840,"To make sure there are no sharp, unnatural  lines. The soft blending creates an ambiguous mood,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,621840,627280,particularly around the corners of the mouth  and the corners of the eyes. This means there  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,627280,634320,"are no hard edges anywhere on the Mona Lisa. They  are all blended in, to form an ambiguous image.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,634880,641840,You can see how the smile ends at each corner - it simply tails away unresolved and open-ended.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,644160,649839,"We can demonstrate this with an X-ray. If we put Raphael and Leonardo side by side,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,649840,655840,an X-ray shows us that Raphael used clearly  defined edges whereas Leonardo's figure  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,655840,665100,"disappears, as he uses none.   As Leonardo wrote: ""The eye never knows the edge of any body"".  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,665920,671360,"This makes her facial expression ""blurry"" or ""fuzzy"",  so that when we look at her, we perceive the  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,671360,679680,expression in different ways. THIS brings her to  life. Leonardo understood light as well as optics.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,680240,685600,"The man who had worked out the reflection of light  from the Earth to the Moon, had also studied how  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,685600,692160,ratios of light and shade hit the face according  to the angle of impact. And this knowledge  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,692160,698160,"combined with the Sfumato, the Chiaroscuro,  and the glazes which affect light refraction,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,698720,705920,means she constantly changes - through optical and  perceptual illusion. In essence these techniques  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,705920,711680,take painting one stage further. It allows us  to look at a painting the way our eyes work.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,711680,718480,"It allows ""depth of field"" never seen in a painting  before. The best way to see how incredibly skilled  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,718480,724399,"Leonardo was, is by looking at Mona Lisa's  gossamer thin veil. Look at it for a bit."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,726560,732640,"On her forehead we can see the dark edges of the  silk veil,  but the light of her skin shines through  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,732640,738720,"the translucent material. But where the veil  crosses the sky, it becomes darker and more visible.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,739440,745000,He would have painted the background first and  then used a transparent glaze to paint the veil over it.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,745810,752240,His representational skill is spectacular.  But his powers of observation are uncanny.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,756400,763008,Actually let's start with what she's NOT wearing.  When was the last time you employed a professional photographer?  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,763535,769120,The answer is usually: A wedding or  a prom. What were you wearing in your prom photo?  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,769120,775600,Your best clothes? Your best jewellery? Of course!  Being painted by one of the most celebrated  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,775600,781519,"and in demand painters of the day, is your chance  to really ""show off"" - and yet Mona Lisa is stripped  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,781520,787746,"of all the usual high status ""symbols"". Her clothes  are nothing special, they tell us nothing.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,788502,795760,"Instead of the usual flamboyant, expensive outfits we see  in commissioned portraits, hers are pretty simple for  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,795760,801920,"a wealthy woman. Along with the complete lack  of jewellery and the simple hair, they serve one  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,801920,810837,purpose - and one purpose only. Leonardo made sure we  would not be distracted from the face of Mona Lisa.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,814720,820240,"Let's talk about her eyebrows, or lack  thereof. It's not down to ""fashion"".  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,820240,829440,"She almost certainly once had them, but over  time with cleaning and restoration,     the most delicate parts of the painting - her  eyebrows and eyelashes - have disappeared.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,831360,837200,"Copies of the painting produced by Leonardo's own  studio, are a good source of information on how  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,837200,840588,she looked in 1503. And here's why.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,842215,851040,Leonardo had a team of  about six assistants and apprentices.   Workshops were training grounds for young  artists to learn their craft over several years.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,851040,857279,"And they begin by copying the masters  works. It's how Leonardo, Michelangelo  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,857280,863040,and other great artists learnt. By copying  masters - then they developed their own style.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,864000,869920,"Multi-spectral analysis in 2004 by art  technician Pascal Cotte, revealed that  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,869920,877920,"Leonardo used a preparatory sketch or a ""Cartoon"" to  create the Mona Lisa, using the ""Spolvaro"" technique,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,877920,884480,a similar idea to tracing. It is a technique that  Renaissance artists would use to make lucrative  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,884480,890079,"copies of their paintings from an original drawing,  as well as copies for their students to work on.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,891440,898000,Leonardo used the Spolvaro technique to transfer  his sketches of the Mona Lisa to a wooden panel.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,898000,904960,"More than once. With this technique, holes are  pricked along the outline of an original drawing  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,904960,912160,"known as a ""Cartoon"" and then dusted with charcoal  to produce an outline ready for painting.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,912720,916399,The analysis shows faint  traces of the charcoal drawing.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,919440,927199,It is most obvious on her hands where the scan    shows us the charcoal pinpricks used  to trace the drawing onto the wood.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,929280,936000,The same sketch would have been used as a base for  his apprentice's copies. From these scans we also  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,936000,941920,"know that as Leonardo made changes to his painting,  the pupil made the same changes to his copy.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,942880,948640,The logical conclusion is that the Prado Mona  Lisa was painted by an apprentice - side by side 
ElWG0_kjy_Y,948640,955440,with Leonardo - using the same pigments and  the same adjustments. This copy was not really  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,955440,962480,"considered important until it was restored in  2012, and the original background was revealed."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,964720,973839,Scientific examination tells us it  was painted by someone working in    Leonardo's studio as an apprentice - and  therefore under Leonardo's supervision.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,975920,981920,By use of infrared radiography we know it is  likely that it was created simultaneously in  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,981920,988639,"the same studio. The Prado copy doesn't have the  mystery of Leonardo's achingly beautiful painting,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,989360,995760,this is something that cannot be copied. But the  excellent state of conservation of the copy gives  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,995760,1001440,"us unique insights into the original painting,  which has become cracked and yellowed with age.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1002160,1009680,"If we take the copy and overlay the two, we get  some idea of what the Mona Lisa might look like  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1009680,1018800,"IF it were possible to restore her. Now we see the  ""rosy lips"" described by Vasari in 1550, and the ""thin  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1018800,1026240,"eyebrows and eyelashes"" he wrote about. Suggesting  that indeed the Mona Lisa once had eyebrows."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1032160,1042079,"Leonardo uses the classic ""pyramid shape""  composition that was introduced during    the Renaissance. It is an important change  from the paintings of the 15th century.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1042720,1053760,"The structure provides stability, but  more importantly it provides a clear    central focus, and directs your gaze. In Mona  Lisa's case, it is pulling us into her face."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1060320,1066159,"Leonardo pioneered the use of the ""three-quarter  length pose"" rather than producing a full length  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1066160,1073440,portrait or the standard profile used at  the time. But why? Because he completely fills  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1073440,1080159,"the frame with his subject, making the painting  more intimate and cutting down on distractions.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1080160,1085178,This three-quarter length pose becomes  the norm in italy for 400 years.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1087360,1093840,"Today we look at Mona Lisa's  pose and it seems fairly ""normal"".    But for its day it was groundbreaking.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1094640,1102960,"Previously subjects were stiff and upright,  aristocratic. But Mona Lisa is relaxed, her hands  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1102960,1109679,"are resting gently on the arm of her chair, as  she turns towards us. Almost as if it's a ""snapshot""."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1111920,1118720,"Mona Lisa is also rather content and self-assured,  which was more how aristocratic men were portrayed,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1118720,1125440,not women. The standard renaissance portraits  of women were in profile and they didn't smile.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1126640,1132640,We are looking directly into her eyes and  she is looking directly at us. Women in  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1132640,1137360,paintings just didn't do that. They didn't  look boldly and directly at the viewer.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1138480,1144129,The entire painting deviated from the  traditional way women were painted in I  taly.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1151360,1158080,Portraits were usually drawn with an open sky as  the background - a monotone background - or a simple room.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1158998,1165000,Mona lisa is in front of a complicated  landscape that only existed in Leonardo's imagination.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1165971,1171120,Paintings in this period had both  the subject and the background in sharp focus.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1172080,1178000,Whereas the background of the Mona Lisa is hyper-  realistic and is created using an illusion of  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1178000,1185760,"depth or recession. This is ""aerial perspective"".  Leonardo was the first to write about it,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1185760,1193040,"and if he didn't invent it, then he certainly  perfected it. Behind Mona Lisa, the vast landscape  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1193040,1200800,proceeds to distant icy mountains. A path and a  bridge are the only indication of human presence.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1201520,1206880,"The curves of her hair and clothing reflect  the rolling valleys and rivers behind her,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1206880,1214960,"connecting humanity and nature. Microcosm  and macrocosm, a favourite theme of Leonardo's.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1216240,1223120,"He used his pioneering studies of hydrodynamics,  not only to explain how an aortic valve closed,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1224000,1230160,"but also to explain the weight, volume and  direction of the curls of hair. The twist  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1230160,1237520,of the earth parallels her torso. Look at the river  on the right. It flows into the scarf over her left  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1237520,1244400,shoulder and we see that she is connected with the  earth. Even the background is informed by science.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1244960,1252720,"This time of ""sedimentary layers"" he studied in  the Apennines. Centuries before Darwin, Leonardo  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1252720,1258320,"guessed, through his studies of rocks and fossils,  that the world is far older than Genesis claims. "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1259360,1264640,His knowledge of geology ensures that there are  no accidents in his plotting of the background. 
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1266080,1272080,And yet the horizon of the landscape does not  quite line up behind the figure. It is very  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1272080,1278720,"slightly ""skewed"", while her shoulders are painted  level. This is a typical Leonardo visual trick that  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1278720,1285120,gives an illusion of movement. Leonardo knew that  our brains would struggle with this conflicting  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1285120,1292480,visual information: We know that the horizon should  line up so we read it as level. This causes us to  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1292480,1303840,"interpret the shoulders as being on a slant - which they are not.  As our brain corrects this, it creates an illusion of movement,  as if the figure ""shuffles"" a bit in its frame."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1309040,1314960,"Lisa's eyes are in fact looking to her left,  but step back and she is looking directly at us.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1315920,1320560,"If your screen is big enough, move to  the right and left. Her eyes follow you."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1322880,1328720,"This effect only works with two-dimensional images,  since the elements of perspective and light and  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1328720,1335280,"shadow are fixed and don't change. They look the  same, no matter from what angle you are standing.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1335280,1338880,"It is a real phenomenon, but  not unique to this painting."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1343200,1352880,"Then there is the smile that  pulls everything together.    Before, during and long after the Renaissance,  artists did not paint their subjects smiling.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1354240,1360240,"When you think about it, portraits are generally  very serious. It's easy enough to smile for  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1360240,1365280,"a few minutes, but not for the weeks if  not months it takes to paint a portrait.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1366480,1373840,"And yet despite the scarcity of a smile in  paintings, Leonardo almost makes it his signature."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1376880,1381760,It is said that Leonardo kept Lisa  happy by employing musicians and jesters.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1383440,1388101,Look at her for a while.  Really look into her eyes. 
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1389386,1400854,"First she is smiling and then she is not.    The smile ""comes and goes"" as we scan around  the face. When we look away the smile lingers.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1402560,1414160,"When Leonardo was perfecting Lisa's smile,  he was spending his nights in the morgue    peeling the flesh off cadavers and exposing  the muscles and nerves underneath. He became  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1414160,1420960,"fascinated by ""how a smile works"" and analysed every  possible movement of each part of the face. Working  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1420960,1427919,out the origins of every nerve which controls the  facial muscles. Here we see two partially dissected  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1427920,1433600,faces in profile. They show the muscles which  control the lips and other elements of expression.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1434480,1439679,"In the one on the left, Leonardo has removed  part of the jawbone to expose the muscle  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1439680,1445774,"which pulls back the angle of the mouth,  and flattens the cheek - as a smile begins to form. "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1446393,1452882,Leonardo reveals the actual mechanisms that  transmit emotions into facial expressions. 
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1453845,1462102,"Extraordinary.   Here are puckered lips, pouting lips,  the muscles that move the mouth.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1462400,1468800,Then almost forgotten at the top of this page is a  simple drawing of a gentle smile sketched lightly  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1468800,1475600,"in black chalk. Even though the fine lines at the  end of the mouth turn down slightly, the feeling is  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1475600,1483684,that the lips are smiling. This simple anatomical  drawing is the beginning of Mona Lisa smile.
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1488080,1494159,"Astonishingly Leonardo had studied the  11th century Islamic physicist Al-Hazen,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1494800,1501200,whose pioneering theories on the psychology of  visual perception inspired his own work on optics.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1502480,1508720,"Leonardo knew from his optic studies, that light  rays do not come to a single point in the eye,"
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1508720,1515000,but instead hit the whole area of the retina -  and this is the key to her enigmatic smile. 
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1515368,1524599,"""Her expression changes as you look at this painting...""  In the year 2000, Dr. Margaret Livingston,  a Harvard neuroscientist   "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1524599,1530702,discovered that Mona Lisa's smile changes because  of how the human visual system is designed. 
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1531779,1542640,"She explains that the human eye has  two distinct regions for seeing the world:    A central area called the ""Fovea"" is where people  see colours, read fine print and pick out details.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1543360,1550186,"And the peripheral area surrounding the Fovea is where  people see black and white, motion and shadows."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1550988,1556080,"When we look at a face, we spend most  of the time focused on the other person's eyes  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1556080,1562159,"using central vision. So when a person's  center of gaze is on Mona Lisa's eyes,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1562160,1567920,"the less accurate peripheral vision, is on her  mouth - and because peripheral vision is not  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1567920,1575040,"interested in ""specific details"", it also picks up  shadows from Mona Lisa's cheekbones. This is where  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1575040,1583840,both his Sfumato and Chiaroscuro techniques come  into their own. Keep looking directly into her eyes.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1584560,1591520,"The shadows and tones suggest the curvature of  a smile, but when your eyes go directly to Mona  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1591520,1599750,"Lisa's mouth, your central vision doesn't see the  shadows and she isn't smiling - smirking at best.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1601120,1606559,You can prove this theory quite simply by  scanning back and forth between her eyes and  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1606560,1614800,"her lips, and her expression changes. That is not  your imagination it is all to do with how we ""see"",  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1614800,1622264,"not how we ""think"". The genius of Leonardo,  is that he understood this 500 years ago!"
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1633280,1640400,Some claim that the Mona Lisa is only well known  because she was once stolen. This is nonsense.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1641760,1647525,"As previously noted, Mona Lisa was seen as a  great painting - right from the start."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1648281,1655440,"in 1797 she was moved to the Louvre where Napoleon  saw her and decided he ""had to have her"".  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1656480,1660799,"So in 1800, he had her moved to his  private bedroom in the Tuilleries.   "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1661520,1666596,"Already the Mona Lisa was a ""masterpiece""  fit for Europe's greatest leader.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1667520,1674320,"In 1825, the first engravings of Mona Lisa  were made - and sold - adding to her popularity.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1675280,1683200,"And in 1854 the first photograph was taken of her. Charles Baudelaire, George Sand and Jules Verne "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1683200,1690639,"were amongst many to write about her. And in  1867, the art critic Theophile Gautier published a  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1690640,1698320,"popular article ""praising her mysterious smile and  her eyes that hid secrets"". While Baedeker guidebooks  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1698320,1704880,"told tourists as early as the 1870s that she was  ""the most celebrated work of Leonardo in the Louvre"".  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1706320,1715360,She was being mass produced  and written about extensively.    Mona Lisa was already on her way to  becoming known worldwide. 
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1716621,1728026,"And then she was stolen.    On the 21st of august 1911, Vincenzo Perugia, a petty  criminal, stole the Mona Lisa and took her to Italy.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1728851,1733532,"It was not until the next afternoon that  anyone realized the painting had been stolen,   "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1734160,1742400,fuelling the idea that nobody cared - but the truth  (as always) was simpler. The Louvre was cataloguing  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1742400,1747962,its collection and museum staff believed that  she had been removed to be photographed. 
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1748512,1755680,"Suspects, including Picasso who was living in Paris  at the time, were rounded up - but no answers were found.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1756880,1765840,"In fact the Mona Lisa was  missing for over two years,    during which people lined up around the block  to look at the empty space where she once was.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1766720,1773679,Perugia was eventually arrested and the Mona Lisa  was recovered. But why did he steal the Mona Lisa  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1773680,1780560,rather than any of the other paintings? The answer  (again) is simple. Because it was the most well-known.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1782080,1789200,So for sure her fame grew enormously after  she was stolen - but it did not begin in 1911.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1790240,1796320,Something else to consider is that it was only by  this time that photography was becoming commonplace.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1796320,1801521,"Suddenly thanks to the press, millions of  people who might not have seen it in person,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1801840,1807840,"might never have even heard of it, soon  became ""experts"" on Leonardo's stolen painting."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1814454,1819783,What really cemented her fame  was her 1963 visit to the U.S.  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1820480,1827090,"This made global headlines, and television brought  the Mona Lisa into the living  room of billions."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1831280,1836960,"""...share the great moment when the 450 year old  masterpiece makes its first public appearance here..."" "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1839280,1846446,"In the same year, Andy Warhol  reflected on her transformation    from a painting into a ""celebrity icon""."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1848160,1854160,"So yes, the theft made her more well-known  and the U.S. tour made her a global ""celebrity"".  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1855040,1861600,"But regardless of all this, the Mona Lisa was  always considered a masterpiece and would have  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1861600,1866400,"become famous in the same way ""The Birth of  Venus"" or ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"" did.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1868240,1873679,"The Mona Lisa, is an image that is so  ""familiar"" that it has been stripped of meaning.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1874960,1879440,"Her ""celebrity"" status is a distraction  from what a masterpiece she really is.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1880080,1889409,"In an era in which we are bombarded with images, it is more important than ever to stop - and look again."
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1896400,1904151,"Whether she is ""Mona Lisa"", ""La Giaconda"" or ""La  Jaconde"", she is the face of a revolution in art. "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1904792,1910960,The Mona Lisa embodies Leonardo da Vinci's  belief that everything is connected. He had the  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1910960,1919039,"ability to combine intellect with imagination. Art  and science are perfectly blended in a single work,  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1919040,1924400,"that may have started as a ""simple portrait"" of  a bourgeois woman but has become something much  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1924400,1932720,"more poetic something ""universal"". Leonardo once  said that ""Art is never finished - just abandoned""  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1933520,1938560,and it would seem apt that a painting  created by a man who never stopped learning  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1938560,1945840,still manages to teach us something - 500 years  after he created it. Despite all the myths and  
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1945840,1951840,"legends surrounding her, we ARE learning more  and more about her through science and studies.  "
ElWG0_kjy_Y,1952640,1959387,Who knows? One day we may see the Mona  Lisa exactly the way Leonardo saw her.
