Vn2vdQZhs0w,830,2879,(whip cracking) (intense music)
Vn2vdQZhs0w,2880,4740,- It's punishment time.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,4740,9209,This enormous pile of to-be-tested DisplayPort cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,9210,12605,comes from all the most popular brands.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,12605,16650,"AmazonBasics, Monoprice, Best Buy, and more."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,16650,19560,We bought three of each at various lengths
Vn2vdQZhs0w,19560,22920,for the most popular models to give us multiple data points
Vn2vdQZhs0w,22920,25850,and we are going to be painstakingly running all of them
Vn2vdQZhs0w,25850,28000,through our Total Phase Cable Tester
Vn2vdQZhs0w,28000,32713,to see who has the good stuff and who has the crude stuff.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,34130,36930,I know our sponsor Build Redux has the good stuff.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,36930,39350,They create PCs for gamers who wanna win
Vn2vdQZhs0w,39350,41670,and who want high frame rates without breaking the bank.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,41670,43519,"They're backed by a two year parts and labor warranty,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,43520,44353,"so you're covered,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,44353,45940,and you can click the link in the video description
Vn2vdQZhs0w,45940,47973,to start creating your PC today.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,50293,52876,(upbeat music)
Vn2vdQZhs0w,56710,57719,"Okay, I lied a bit."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,57720,60410,"The cables have already been tested at their rated speed,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,60410,61660,"and if they passed,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,61660,63280,we pushed them even further
Vn2vdQZhs0w,63280,66770,to see who is under promising and over delivering.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,66770,69340,We did over 100 runs in total
Vn2vdQZhs0w,69340,74090,and ended up with this masterpiece of a spreadsheet.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,74090,75490,"Proud of this one, aren't ya?"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,75490,76700,"- [Colin] Oh, yeah."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,76700,77670,- Nerd.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,77670,80330,Now why are we testing DisplayPort?
Vn2vdQZhs0w,80330,82920,Partly because we already tested HDMI
Vn2vdQZhs0w,82920,85750,"and got a lot of requests to follow up with DisplayPort,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,85750,88220,but the other half is that people like me
Vn2vdQZhs0w,88220,89980,and Wendell over at Level 1 Techs
Vn2vdQZhs0w,89980,91260,who apparently actually went out
Vn2vdQZhs0w,91260,95010,and bought one of these cable testers after our last video
Vn2vdQZhs0w,95010,96820,have had a lot of issues
Vn2vdQZhs0w,96820,98580,with DisplayPort over the years
Vn2vdQZhs0w,98580,100850,from intermittent signaling issues
Vn2vdQZhs0w,100850,102810,to outright dead cables.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,102810,106270,And I think it's about time I figure out why.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,106270,108530,Each cable went through our Total Phase Cable Tester
Vn2vdQZhs0w,108530,110110,at the spec that it's rated for.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,110110,110943,"Now, there are a total"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,110943,113260,"of eight versions of DisplayPort,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,113260,115500,two of which are minor a revisions
Vn2vdQZhs0w,115500,116580,that don't change much.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,116580,119430,"So we'll acknowledge that they exist and move along,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,119430,120940,"and even some of the numbered ones,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,120940,122170,we didn't have to do much with.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,122170,126540,"DisplayPort versions, 1.0 and 1.1 are relatively ancient,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,126540,128390,so that's part of why we're not testing
Vn2vdQZhs0w,128390,129670,any of those cables here.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,129670,132530,"But the real reason is that they weren't widely adopted,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,132530,137530,"so most cables are rated for at least DisplayPort 1.2,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,137550,139653,"and it's the same story for DisplayPort 1.3,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,140490,143920,"it was superseded by 1.4 almost immediately,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,143920,145720,"which carries the same bandwidth,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,145720,148790,but added support for display stream compression 1.2
Vn2vdQZhs0w,148790,151840,forward error correction and HDR 10 metadata.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,151840,154513,"That leaves us with really three DisplayPorts that matter,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,154513,159390,"1.2, 1.4 and the upcoming 2.0 spec."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,159390,160610,"In consumer terms,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,160610,163090,the biggest difference between these three
Vn2vdQZhs0w,163090,164360,is that each one is rated
Vn2vdQZhs0w,164360,166720,"for a different maximum bandwidth,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,166720,169820,"the higher, the number, the faster it can go."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,169820,172330,"Now, there are multiple ways to hit that limit,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,172330,174160,"you could crank the resolution,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,174160,175690,"you could crank the refresh rate,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,175690,177180,"you could crank the color depth,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,177180,180629,"or realistically some combination of those three,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,180630,182240,and then you just won't be able
Vn2vdQZhs0w,182240,184560,to go any higher unless you enable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,184560,185840,"display stream compression,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,185840,187920,we could talk a little bit more about that later.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,187920,190550,"Now, here are the manufacturers we're talking about today."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,190550,191930,You'll be familiar with many of these
Vn2vdQZhs0w,191930,193629,"from our HDMI cable testing video,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,193630,196460,where we covered some things in more depth
Vn2vdQZhs0w,196460,198530,"that we're gonna gloss over a little bit today,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,198530,200300,like how digital signaling works.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,200300,201610,We're gonna have a card in the end screen
Vn2vdQZhs0w,201610,202600,if you're playing catch-up.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,202600,205040,"Now, here are our tests,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,205040,207170,"we have three groupings,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,207170,209090,tab one in yellow are the cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,209090,211620,"that we're testing in triplicate to eliminate flukes,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,211620,212909,"these are the most popular ones,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,212910,215260,we're expecting most of you to actually buy.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,215260,218420,Tab two in orange are single samples
Vn2vdQZhs0w,218420,221500,of 9 of the top 10 cables on Amazon.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,221500,223580,"And finally, tab three in blue"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,223580,225770,"are cables that we sampled from around the office,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,225770,227790,including bundled cables from monitors
Vn2vdQZhs0w,227790,230713,"made by Aorus, Samsung, and ASUS ROG."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,231690,235601,"All right, Colin, show us what's behind tab number one."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,235601,236855,(drums rolling)
Vn2vdQZhs0w,236855,238800,"- [Colin] Okay, they all passed."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,238800,240730,- Every single one passed.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,240730,241562,- [Colin] Every one.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,241563,243240,"- Every, huh."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,243240,245740,That's not what I was expecting.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,245740,249840,So every single brand new cable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,249840,253390,that we purchased specifically for this video passed
Vn2vdQZhs0w,253390,258390,"at its rated spec which I didn't see coming,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,258690,262060,but the science behind it kind of makes sense.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,262060,263180,"Here's the thing,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,263180,265130,the inside of a DisplayPort cable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,265130,269120,"is actually very similar to the inside of an HDMI cable,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,269120,270960,with only one more conductor
Vn2vdQZhs0w,270960,274009,for a total of 20 versus 19.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,274010,278380,Both of them have four-shielded twisted pairs of conductors.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,278380,279680,You could think of them kind of like
Vn2vdQZhs0w,279680,281870,the sides of this lanyard
Vn2vdQZhs0w,281870,285720,"but in HDMI, only three of them carry data,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,285720,288320,with a fourth kind of skinnier one
Vn2vdQZhs0w,288320,290937,that just is reserved for clock pulses.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,290937,293000,DisplayPort takes advantage here
Vn2vdQZhs0w,293000,295470,by using all four shielded pairs
Vn2vdQZhs0w,295470,296460,to transmit data.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,296460,297889,"You know what, this isn't working,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,297890,299860,"let's just do a different visual,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,299860,302379,new colors of lanyards on lttstore.com.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,302380,305360,This allows each pair to run at a lower frequency
Vn2vdQZhs0w,305360,309539,while maintaining overall transmission parity with HDMI.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,309540,311740,So with 12 of the 20 conductors used
Vn2vdQZhs0w,311740,314610,"for the signal plus, signal minus and ground connections,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,314610,316419,that leaves eight other conductors
Vn2vdQZhs0w,316420,318630,"that are used to run a configuration channel,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,318630,321150,"an auxiliary channel, and a power connection."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,321150,323320,The power connection actually goes unused
Vn2vdQZhs0w,323320,324360,"in common cables though,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,324360,325990,and is reserved for use in devices
Vn2vdQZhs0w,325990,328569,"with integrated DisplayPort cables,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,328570,330790,and having these wires connected can actually
Vn2vdQZhs0w,330790,332240,cause a short circuit condition
Vn2vdQZhs0w,332240,333639,"that was a problem in the past,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,333640,336350,particularly with cheap mini DisplayPort cables.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,336350,337470,"Fun fact, by the way,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,337470,339710,those locking tabs on the end are not
Vn2vdQZhs0w,339710,342780,"actually part of the official DisplayPort specification,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,342780,344020,they are nice to have though.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,344020,346000,"Now with respect to our results,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,346000,349050,we can gather that this reduction in signaling frequency
Vn2vdQZhs0w,349050,351259,"is contributing to better signal integrity,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,351260,352630,leading to DisplayPort cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,352630,356400,being more consistent than what we saw with HDMI.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,356400,358870,"So if you're buying a brand new cable today,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,358870,361160,"cheap is probably cheerful,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,361160,363740,and Infinite Cables once again topped our list
Vn2vdQZhs0w,363740,365259,"for the lowest cost per foot,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,365260,368030,"followed by AmazonBasics and Monoprice,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,368030,369900,but we're not done yet.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,369900,371889,"Inside the dense document,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,371890,373560,"that is the DisplayPort standard,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,373560,376970,"there exists a set of definitions for transmission modes,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,376970,379170,these are the bit rates that DisplayPorts
Vn2vdQZhs0w,379170,380700,can transmit data at.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,380700,383890,"We're not talking about resolutions per se,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,383890,385040,but rather the speed
Vn2vdQZhs0w,385040,387800,"at which the cable operates, full stop."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,387800,389699,"DisplayPort 1.4, for example,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,389700,392840,"is compatible with four different transmission modes,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,392840,396710,"RBR, HBR, HBR2 and HBR3,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,396710,400289,"which peaks at 8.1 gigabits per second, per lane."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,400290,401910,"That means with four lanes,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,401910,404130,DisplayPort 1.4's peak bandwidth
Vn2vdQZhs0w,404130,406610,is 32.4 gigabits per second.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,406610,410120,That is significantly less than the 48 gigabit per second
Vn2vdQZhs0w,410120,411663,maximum of HDMI 2.1.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,413130,415600,I am not calling it that (chuckles).
Vn2vdQZhs0w,415600,418360,"To get around this, some applications of DisplayPort"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,418360,421210,have implemented more than the usual four lanes.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,421210,422520,Apple famously created
Vn2vdQZhs0w,422520,425599,a custom eight-lane DisplayPort 1.2 interface
Vn2vdQZhs0w,425600,427580,"to drive the first 5K iMac,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,427580,430439,and Thunderbolt can also have up to eight lanes
Vn2vdQZhs0w,430440,432500,allowing it to carry two display signals
Vn2vdQZhs0w,432500,434270,over a single cable.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,434270,436030,"The longterm solution, however,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,436030,440270,"is DisplayPort 2.0, which can run in three new modes"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,440270,442840,named according to their per lane bit rate.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,442840,444810,"Now we'll talk about why that matters shortly,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,444810,447000,"but first let's take a look at our next tab,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,447000,448713,Amazon's best sellers.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,449580,450680,How'd they do?
Vn2vdQZhs0w,450680,451930,- [Colin] All passed.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,451930,452949,- Every single one passed again?
Vn2vdQZhs0w,452950,454180,- [Colin] Again.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,454180,456130,- Now that's crazy.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,456130,457210,Every single one of them
Vn2vdQZhs0w,457210,460440,"not only met the current spec that they were rated for,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,460440,464823,"but even met the next gen UHBR10 spec, wild."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,466610,469099,"Now they're not an amazing deal cost-wise,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,469100,473210,"but at least they're easy to order, I guess,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,473210,476180,"and they helped us confirm an interesting pattern,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,476180,477350,or so we thought.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,477350,479020,One of the insidious ways
Vn2vdQZhs0w,479020,482250,that a bad DisplayPort cable can get ya
Vn2vdQZhs0w,482250,486400,is by working but not working at the correct link speed.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,486400,488340,"That's actually a feature, not a bug."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,488340,491210,"DisplayPort is fully backwards compatible,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,491210,492880,"so every time you plug in,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,492880,496310,the devices go through a sort of handshake process
Vn2vdQZhs0w,496310,497400,"called link training,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,497400,498650,which determines the speed
Vn2vdQZhs0w,498650,500900,"that they can operate at without errors,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,500900,503560,and even if the devices are both capable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,503560,505070,"of a greater speed,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,505070,506323,"let's say DisplayPort 1.4,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,507760,510140,a bad cable could drag them back
Vn2vdQZhs0w,510140,512030,"to a slower link speed,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,512030,514349,"let's say DisplayPort 1.2,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,514349,516880,and this can be really hard to diagnose
Vn2vdQZhs0w,516880,520870,"because the links can be renegotiated on the fly,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,520870,523279,"meaning that they might work fine for a bit,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,523280,527020,"then drop down, only to jump back into action again."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,527020,531100,"And we ran into just such a cable in tab number three,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,531100,533519,where we grabbed some longer DisplayPort cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,533520,535180,"that we've purchased over the years,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,535180,536839,as well as a handful of cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,536840,539460,that were included with the monitors.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,539460,541850,"I knew it (laughs), I knew it."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,541850,543329,I've had so many issues
Vn2vdQZhs0w,543330,545650,with those 25-foot Monoprice cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,545650,548070,"that we bought in bulk, like ages ago,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,548070,548910,"but on this one,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,548910,551850,"one of the four pairs managed a continuity check,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,551850,555389,"so it is connected, but failed on signal,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,555390,558210,which is the worst kind of fail.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,558210,560994,I'm going to enjoy cutting this cable up.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,560994,561827,"- [Brandon] Oh my God,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,561827,563090,that nearly hit the lens.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,563090,564200,- Oh did it really? - [Brandon] Yeah.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,564200,566610,- We also had one of Samsung's bundled cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,566610,567930,"fail out right here,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,567930,569760,continuity means that the conductors
Vn2vdQZhs0w,569760,572130,are just not conducting.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,572130,574400,Now we didn't have enough of those kicking
Vn2vdQZhs0w,574400,577890,around that we could just positively identify
Vn2vdQZhs0w,577890,579530,"as Samsung bundled cables,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,579530,581970,so we couldn't draw a clear conclusion.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,581970,582949,"Other than that,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,582950,584660,the one included with your monitor
Vn2vdQZhs0w,584660,586790,"might not be the best quality,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,586790,589259,but pretty much any reputable brand cable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,589260,591350,"off the shelf should be okay,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,591350,593290,even if you're a forward-thinking consumer
Vn2vdQZhs0w,593290,594380,who might wanna get the most
Vn2vdQZhs0w,594380,596730,"out of Intel's upcoming Arc Alchemist GPU's,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,596730,599203,which are confirmed to have DisplayPort 2.0.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,600310,602550,Thanks to Samsung for sponsoring today's video.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,602550,604290,"Samsung has something new for you,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,604290,607470,"The freestyle, it's a point and play projector"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,607470,608629,with a compact design
Vn2vdQZhs0w,608630,611100,"and adjustable 180 degree cradle stand,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,611100,613380,you don't need to worry about fiddling with a focus wheel
Vn2vdQZhs0w,613380,615240,or rearranging your projector
Vn2vdQZhs0w,615240,616980,because the auto sensing feature
Vn2vdQZhs0w,616980,621019,will intuitively correct skewed and blurry images for you.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,621020,621920,"If you're on the go,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,621920,624850,the freestyle has a 360 degrees speaker
Vn2vdQZhs0w,624850,628699,"and a five watt woofer for powerful all around sound,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,628700,631360,"and you can power it with an external battery,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,631360,633050,so it works no matter where you are.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,633050,635649,It uses Samsung's built-in Smart TV experience
Vn2vdQZhs0w,635650,639050,"that features Samsung TV plus, various streaming platforms,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,639050,641529,and more while also allowing you to use Bixby
Vn2vdQZhs0w,641530,644750,or Amazon A-L-E-X-A so that you can go hands-free.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,644750,646330,It offers full HD resolution
Vn2vdQZhs0w,646330,647780,and the ability to project an image
Vn2vdQZhs0w,647780,650170,"between 30 and 100 inches,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,650170,652010,"allowing you to use it in a small space,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,652010,653410,or you can go all out
Vn2vdQZhs0w,653410,655399,and create an at-home theater experience.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,655400,657410,So take your theater with you wherever you go
Vn2vdQZhs0w,657410,658243,with the Freestyle.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,658243,660510,"You can learn more about Samsung's The Freestyle,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,660510,661920,and get a free carrying case
Vn2vdQZhs0w,661920,663920,if you pre-order before February 10th
Vn2vdQZhs0w,663920,665779,using the link down below.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,665780,666760,"If you guys enjoyed this video,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,666760,668980,"go check out the HDMI cable testing video,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,668980,671050,where we've got into a little bit more depth
Vn2vdQZhs0w,671050,672680,about what some of the charts
Vn2vdQZhs0w,672680,675080,"that you guys might be looking at here mean,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,675080,677690,"and yeah, see like the eye diagrams and stuff,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,677690,681083,and why a narrow eye is a bad eye.

Vn2vdQZhs0w,830,2879,(whip cracking) (intense music)
Vn2vdQZhs0w,2880,4740,- It's punishment time.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,4740,9209,This enormous pile of to-be-tested DisplayPort cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,9210,12605,comes from all the most popular brands.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,12605,16650,"AmazonBasics, Monoprice, Best Buy, and more."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,16650,19560,We bought three of each at various lengths
Vn2vdQZhs0w,19560,22920,for the most popular models to give us multiple data points
Vn2vdQZhs0w,22920,25850,and we are going to be painstakingly running all of them
Vn2vdQZhs0w,25850,28000,through our Total Phase Cable Tester
Vn2vdQZhs0w,28000,32713,to see who has the good stuff and who has the crude stuff.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,34130,36930,I know our sponsor Build Redux has the good stuff.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,36930,39350,They create PCs for gamers who wanna win
Vn2vdQZhs0w,39350,41670,and who want high frame rates without breaking the bank.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,41670,43519,"They're backed by a two year parts and labor warranty,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,43520,44353,"so you're covered,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,44353,45940,and you can click the link in the video description
Vn2vdQZhs0w,45940,47973,to start creating your PC today.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,50293,52876,(upbeat music)
Vn2vdQZhs0w,56710,57719,"Okay, I lied a bit."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,57720,60410,"The cables have already been tested at their rated speed,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,60410,61660,"and if they passed,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,61660,63280,we pushed them even further
Vn2vdQZhs0w,63280,66770,to see who is under promising and over delivering.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,66770,69340,We did over 100 runs in total
Vn2vdQZhs0w,69340,74090,and ended up with this masterpiece of a spreadsheet.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,74090,75490,"Proud of this one, aren't ya?"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,75490,76700,"- [Colin] Oh, yeah."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,76700,77670,- Nerd.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,77670,80330,Now why are we testing DisplayPort?
Vn2vdQZhs0w,80330,82920,Partly because we already tested HDMI
Vn2vdQZhs0w,82920,85750,"and got a lot of requests to follow up with DisplayPort,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,85750,88220,but the other half is that people like me
Vn2vdQZhs0w,88220,89980,and Wendell over at Level 1 Techs
Vn2vdQZhs0w,89980,91260,who apparently actually went out
Vn2vdQZhs0w,91260,95010,and bought one of these cable testers after our last video
Vn2vdQZhs0w,95010,96820,have had a lot of issues
Vn2vdQZhs0w,96820,98580,with DisplayPort over the years
Vn2vdQZhs0w,98580,100850,from intermittent signaling issues
Vn2vdQZhs0w,100850,102810,to outright dead cables.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,102810,106270,And I think it's about time I figure out why.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,106270,108530,Each cable went through our Total Phase Cable Tester
Vn2vdQZhs0w,108530,110110,at the spec that it's rated for.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,110110,110943,"Now, there are a total"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,110943,113260,"of eight versions of DisplayPort,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,113260,115500,two of which are minor a revisions
Vn2vdQZhs0w,115500,116580,that don't change much.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,116580,119430,"So we'll acknowledge that they exist and move along,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,119430,120940,"and even some of the numbered ones,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,120940,122170,we didn't have to do much with.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,122170,126540,"DisplayPort versions, 1.0 and 1.1 are relatively ancient,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,126540,128390,so that's part of why we're not testing
Vn2vdQZhs0w,128390,129670,any of those cables here.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,129670,132530,"But the real reason is that they weren't widely adopted,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,132530,137530,"so most cables are rated for at least DisplayPort 1.2,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,137550,139653,"and it's the same story for DisplayPort 1.3,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,140490,143920,"it was superseded by 1.4 almost immediately,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,143920,145720,"which carries the same bandwidth,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,145720,148790,but added support for display stream compression 1.2
Vn2vdQZhs0w,148790,151840,forward error correction and HDR 10 metadata.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,151840,154513,"That leaves us with really three DisplayPorts that matter,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,154513,159390,"1.2, 1.4 and the upcoming 2.0 spec."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,159390,160610,"In consumer terms,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,160610,163090,the biggest difference between these three
Vn2vdQZhs0w,163090,164360,is that each one is rated
Vn2vdQZhs0w,164360,166720,"for a different maximum bandwidth,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,166720,169820,"the higher, the number, the faster it can go."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,169820,172330,"Now, there are multiple ways to hit that limit,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,172330,174160,"you could crank the resolution,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,174160,175690,"you could crank the refresh rate,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,175690,177180,"you could crank the color depth,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,177180,180629,"or realistically some combination of those three,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,180630,182240,and then you just won't be able
Vn2vdQZhs0w,182240,184560,to go any higher unless you enable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,184560,185840,"display stream compression,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,185840,187920,we could talk a little bit more about that later.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,187920,190550,"Now, here are the manufacturers we're talking about today."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,190550,191930,You'll be familiar with many of these
Vn2vdQZhs0w,191930,193629,"from our HDMI cable testing video,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,193630,196460,where we covered some things in more depth
Vn2vdQZhs0w,196460,198530,"that we're gonna gloss over a little bit today,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,198530,200300,like how digital signaling works.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,200300,201610,We're gonna have a card in the end screen
Vn2vdQZhs0w,201610,202600,if you're playing catch-up.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,202600,205040,"Now, here are our tests,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,205040,207170,"we have three groupings,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,207170,209090,tab one in yellow are the cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,209090,211620,"that we're testing in triplicate to eliminate flukes,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,211620,212909,"these are the most popular ones,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,212910,215260,we're expecting most of you to actually buy.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,215260,218420,Tab two in orange are single samples
Vn2vdQZhs0w,218420,221500,of 9 of the top 10 cables on Amazon.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,221500,223580,"And finally, tab three in blue"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,223580,225770,"are cables that we sampled from around the office,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,225770,227790,including bundled cables from monitors
Vn2vdQZhs0w,227790,230713,"made by Aorus, Samsung, and ASUS ROG."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,231690,235601,"All right, Colin, show us what's behind tab number one."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,235601,236855,(drums rolling)
Vn2vdQZhs0w,236855,238800,"- [Colin] Okay, they all passed."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,238800,240730,- Every single one passed.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,240730,241562,- [Colin] Every one.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,241563,243240,"- Every, huh."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,243240,245740,That's not what I was expecting.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,245740,249840,So every single brand new cable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,249840,253390,that we purchased specifically for this video passed
Vn2vdQZhs0w,253390,258390,"at its rated spec which I didn't see coming,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,258690,262060,but the science behind it kind of makes sense.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,262060,263180,"Here's the thing,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,263180,265130,the inside of a DisplayPort cable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,265130,269120,"is actually very similar to the inside of an HDMI cable,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,269120,270960,with only one more conductor
Vn2vdQZhs0w,270960,274009,for a total of 20 versus 19.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,274010,278380,Both of them have four-shielded twisted pairs of conductors.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,278380,279680,You could think of them kind of like
Vn2vdQZhs0w,279680,281870,the sides of this lanyard
Vn2vdQZhs0w,281870,285720,"but in HDMI, only three of them carry data,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,285720,288320,with a fourth kind of skinnier one
Vn2vdQZhs0w,288320,290937,that just is reserved for clock pulses.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,290937,293000,DisplayPort takes advantage here
Vn2vdQZhs0w,293000,295470,by using all four shielded pairs
Vn2vdQZhs0w,295470,296460,to transmit data.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,296460,297889,"You know what, this isn't working,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,297890,299860,"let's just do a different visual,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,299860,302379,new colors of lanyards on lttstore.com.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,302380,305360,This allows each pair to run at a lower frequency
Vn2vdQZhs0w,305360,309539,while maintaining overall transmission parity with HDMI.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,309540,311740,So with 12 of the 20 conductors used
Vn2vdQZhs0w,311740,314610,"for the signal plus, signal minus and ground connections,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,314610,316419,that leaves eight other conductors
Vn2vdQZhs0w,316420,318630,"that are used to run a configuration channel,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,318630,321150,"an auxiliary channel, and a power connection."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,321150,323320,The power connection actually goes unused
Vn2vdQZhs0w,323320,324360,"in common cables though,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,324360,325990,and is reserved for use in devices
Vn2vdQZhs0w,325990,328569,"with integrated DisplayPort cables,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,328570,330790,and having these wires connected can actually
Vn2vdQZhs0w,330790,332240,cause a short circuit condition
Vn2vdQZhs0w,332240,333639,"that was a problem in the past,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,333640,336350,particularly with cheap mini DisplayPort cables.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,336350,337470,"Fun fact, by the way,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,337470,339710,those locking tabs on the end are not
Vn2vdQZhs0w,339710,342780,"actually part of the official DisplayPort specification,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,342780,344020,they are nice to have though.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,344020,346000,"Now with respect to our results,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,346000,349050,we can gather that this reduction in signaling frequency
Vn2vdQZhs0w,349050,351259,"is contributing to better signal integrity,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,351260,352630,leading to DisplayPort cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,352630,356400,being more consistent than what we saw with HDMI.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,356400,358870,"So if you're buying a brand new cable today,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,358870,361160,"cheap is probably cheerful,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,361160,363740,and Infinite Cables once again topped our list
Vn2vdQZhs0w,363740,365259,"for the lowest cost per foot,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,365260,368030,"followed by AmazonBasics and Monoprice,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,368030,369900,but we're not done yet.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,369900,371889,"Inside the dense document,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,371890,373560,"that is the DisplayPort standard,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,373560,376970,"there exists a set of definitions for transmission modes,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,376970,379170,these are the bit rates that DisplayPorts
Vn2vdQZhs0w,379170,380700,can transmit data at.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,380700,383890,"We're not talking about resolutions per se,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,383890,385040,but rather the speed
Vn2vdQZhs0w,385040,387800,"at which the cable operates, full stop."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,387800,389699,"DisplayPort 1.4, for example,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,389700,392840,"is compatible with four different transmission modes,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,392840,396710,"RBR, HBR, HBR2 and HBR3,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,396710,400289,"which peaks at 8.1 gigabits per second, per lane."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,400290,401910,"That means with four lanes,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,401910,404130,DisplayPort 1.4's peak bandwidth
Vn2vdQZhs0w,404130,406610,is 32.4 gigabits per second.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,406610,410120,That is significantly less than the 48 gigabit per second
Vn2vdQZhs0w,410120,411663,maximum of HDMI 2.1.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,413130,415600,I am not calling it that (chuckles).
Vn2vdQZhs0w,415600,418360,"To get around this, some applications of DisplayPort"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,418360,421210,have implemented more than the usual four lanes.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,421210,422520,Apple famously created
Vn2vdQZhs0w,422520,425599,a custom eight-lane DisplayPort 1.2 interface
Vn2vdQZhs0w,425600,427580,"to drive the first 5K iMac,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,427580,430439,and Thunderbolt can also have up to eight lanes
Vn2vdQZhs0w,430440,432500,allowing it to carry two display signals
Vn2vdQZhs0w,432500,434270,over a single cable.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,434270,436030,"The longterm solution, however,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,436030,440270,"is DisplayPort 2.0, which can run in three new modes"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,440270,442840,named according to their per lane bit rate.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,442840,444810,"Now we'll talk about why that matters shortly,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,444810,447000,"but first let's take a look at our next tab,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,447000,448713,Amazon's best sellers.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,449580,450680,How'd they do?
Vn2vdQZhs0w,450680,451930,- [Colin] All passed.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,451930,452949,- Every single one passed again?
Vn2vdQZhs0w,452950,454180,- [Colin] Again.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,454180,456130,- Now that's crazy.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,456130,457210,Every single one of them
Vn2vdQZhs0w,457210,460440,"not only met the current spec that they were rated for,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,460440,464823,"but even met the next gen UHBR10 spec, wild."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,466610,469099,"Now they're not an amazing deal cost-wise,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,469100,473210,"but at least they're easy to order, I guess,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,473210,476180,"and they helped us confirm an interesting pattern,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,476180,477350,or so we thought.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,477350,479020,One of the insidious ways
Vn2vdQZhs0w,479020,482250,that a bad DisplayPort cable can get ya
Vn2vdQZhs0w,482250,486400,is by working but not working at the correct link speed.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,486400,488340,"That's actually a feature, not a bug."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,488340,491210,"DisplayPort is fully backwards compatible,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,491210,492880,"so every time you plug in,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,492880,496310,the devices go through a sort of handshake process
Vn2vdQZhs0w,496310,497400,"called link training,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,497400,498650,which determines the speed
Vn2vdQZhs0w,498650,500900,"that they can operate at without errors,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,500900,503560,and even if the devices are both capable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,503560,505070,"of a greater speed,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,505070,506323,"let's say DisplayPort 1.4,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,507760,510140,a bad cable could drag them back
Vn2vdQZhs0w,510140,512030,"to a slower link speed,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,512030,514349,"let's say DisplayPort 1.2,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,514349,516880,and this can be really hard to diagnose
Vn2vdQZhs0w,516880,520870,"because the links can be renegotiated on the fly,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,520870,523279,"meaning that they might work fine for a bit,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,523280,527020,"then drop down, only to jump back into action again."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,527020,531100,"And we ran into just such a cable in tab number three,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,531100,533519,where we grabbed some longer DisplayPort cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,533520,535180,"that we've purchased over the years,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,535180,536839,as well as a handful of cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,536840,539460,that were included with the monitors.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,539460,541850,"I knew it (laughs), I knew it."
Vn2vdQZhs0w,541850,543329,I've had so many issues
Vn2vdQZhs0w,543330,545650,with those 25-foot Monoprice cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,545650,548070,"that we bought in bulk, like ages ago,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,548070,548910,"but on this one,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,548910,551850,"one of the four pairs managed a continuity check,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,551850,555389,"so it is connected, but failed on signal,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,555390,558210,which is the worst kind of fail.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,558210,560994,I'm going to enjoy cutting this cable up.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,560994,561827,"- [Brandon] Oh my God,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,561827,563090,that nearly hit the lens.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,563090,564200,- Oh did it really? - [Brandon] Yeah.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,564200,566610,- We also had one of Samsung's bundled cables
Vn2vdQZhs0w,566610,567930,"fail out right here,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,567930,569760,continuity means that the conductors
Vn2vdQZhs0w,569760,572130,are just not conducting.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,572130,574400,Now we didn't have enough of those kicking
Vn2vdQZhs0w,574400,577890,around that we could just positively identify
Vn2vdQZhs0w,577890,579530,"as Samsung bundled cables,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,579530,581970,so we couldn't draw a clear conclusion.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,581970,582949,"Other than that,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,582950,584660,the one included with your monitor
Vn2vdQZhs0w,584660,586790,"might not be the best quality,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,586790,589259,but pretty much any reputable brand cable
Vn2vdQZhs0w,589260,591350,"off the shelf should be okay,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,591350,593290,even if you're a forward-thinking consumer
Vn2vdQZhs0w,593290,594380,who might wanna get the most
Vn2vdQZhs0w,594380,596730,"out of Intel's upcoming Arc Alchemist GPU's,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,596730,599203,which are confirmed to have DisplayPort 2.0.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,600310,602550,Thanks to Samsung for sponsoring today's video.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,602550,604290,"Samsung has something new for you,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,604290,607470,"The freestyle, it's a point and play projector"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,607470,608629,with a compact design
Vn2vdQZhs0w,608630,611100,"and adjustable 180 degree cradle stand,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,611100,613380,you don't need to worry about fiddling with a focus wheel
Vn2vdQZhs0w,613380,615240,or rearranging your projector
Vn2vdQZhs0w,615240,616980,because the auto sensing feature
Vn2vdQZhs0w,616980,621019,will intuitively correct skewed and blurry images for you.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,621020,621920,"If you're on the go,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,621920,624850,the freestyle has a 360 degrees speaker
Vn2vdQZhs0w,624850,628699,"and a five watt woofer for powerful all around sound,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,628700,631360,"and you can power it with an external battery,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,631360,633050,so it works no matter where you are.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,633050,635649,It uses Samsung's built-in Smart TV experience
Vn2vdQZhs0w,635650,639050,"that features Samsung TV plus, various streaming platforms,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,639050,641529,and more while also allowing you to use Bixby
Vn2vdQZhs0w,641530,644750,or Amazon A-L-E-X-A so that you can go hands-free.
Vn2vdQZhs0w,644750,646330,It offers full HD resolution
Vn2vdQZhs0w,646330,647780,and the ability to project an image
Vn2vdQZhs0w,647780,650170,"between 30 and 100 inches,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,650170,652010,"allowing you to use it in a small space,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,652010,653410,or you can go all out
Vn2vdQZhs0w,653410,655399,and create an at-home theater experience.

Vn2vdQZhs0w,665780,666760,"If you guys enjoyed this video,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,666760,668980,"go check out the HDMI cable testing video,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,668980,671050,where we've got into a little bit more depth
Vn2vdQZhs0w,671050,672680,about what some of the charts
Vn2vdQZhs0w,672680,675080,"that you guys might be looking at here mean,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,675080,677690,"and yeah, see like the eye diagrams and stuff,"
Vn2vdQZhs0w,677690,681083,and why a narrow eye is a bad eye.
