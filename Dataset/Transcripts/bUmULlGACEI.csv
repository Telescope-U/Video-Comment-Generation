bUmULlGACEI,80,1708,- I read one science fiction story
bUmULlGACEI,1708,5490,where the bad guy gets thrown into a black hole.
bUmULlGACEI,5490,10150,"And he screams. In fact, he screams forever."
bUmULlGACEI,10150,13620,"I'm Dr. Michio Kaku, professor of theoretical physics"
bUmULlGACEI,13620,16750,"and best-selling author of ""The God Equation""."
bUmULlGACEI,16750,20070,And I'm here today to answer your questions on Twitter.
bUmULlGACEI,20070,22270,"This is ""Physics Support""."
bUmULlGACEI,22270,24937,[upbeat music]
bUmULlGACEI,26650,29610,"Cal is not a cow asked, ""Y'all,"
bUmULlGACEI,29610,31916,why do atoms want to bond so much?
bUmULlGACEI,31916,34193,Why don't they just stay single?
bUmULlGACEI,34193,36590,"You aren't missing anything."""
bUmULlGACEI,36590,39560,Atoms want to bond together. That's why we have molecules.
bUmULlGACEI,39560,41700,"That's why we have people, DNA."
bUmULlGACEI,41700,43720,Our universe is based on atoms
bUmULlGACEI,43720,45160,which like to bond with each other.
bUmULlGACEI,45160,49200,"The electron vibrates back and forth, binding them together."
bUmULlGACEI,49200,50728,And that's why we have molecules.
bUmULlGACEI,50728,53080,That's why we have you.
bUmULlGACEI,53080,57720,You are a consequence of the fact that electrons are shared
bUmULlGACEI,57720,60000,between different atoms
bUmULlGACEI,60000,62210,using the laws of the quantum theory.
bUmULlGACEI,62210,64436,"Debora Mroczek asked the question,"
bUmULlGACEI,64436,66929,"""What's your favorite law of physics?"
bUmULlGACEI,66930,69650,"Mine is momentum conservation."""
bUmULlGACEI,69650,71450,"Well, my favorite law of physics is"
bUmULlGACEI,71450,73979,"the equivalence of matter and energy,"
bUmULlGACEI,73980,77400,"Einstein's equation, E=mc squared."
bUmULlGACEI,77400,81027,This is why the sun shines. It's why the stars twinkle.
bUmULlGACEI,81027,83840,It's what lights up the universe.
bUmULlGACEI,83840,86090,We like to think that matter and energy
bUmULlGACEI,86090,87534,are totally different things.
bUmULlGACEI,87535,90860,How can a rock turn into energy?
bUmULlGACEI,90860,92935,"However, if that rock is uranium"
bUmULlGACEI,92935,96040,"and that energy is the fireball of a nuclear bomb,"
bUmULlGACEI,96040,99052,you realize that matter and energy are two sides
bUmULlGACEI,99052,101220,of the same coin.
bUmULlGACEI,101220,103540,Matter energy is one unit.
bUmULlGACEI,103540,105911,And they can flip into each other
bUmULlGACEI,105911,110440,"under certain circumstances, like in the heart of a star."
bUmULlGACEI,110440,113996,"Sean Harris, @InfoSecHotSpot asked,"
bUmULlGACEI,113996,117928,does anyone know of people like Michio Kaku
bUmULlGACEI,117928,121316,"that can explain ""string theory"" like he does"
bUmULlGACEI,121316,123432,for people like me?
bUmULlGACEI,123432,124932,And I'm not a genius.
bUmULlGACEI,124932,127850,"Well, I am Michio Kaku"
bUmULlGACEI,127850,130470,and I'd be glad to answer that question.
bUmULlGACEI,130470,135000,"First of all, most textbooks say that an electron is a dot."
bUmULlGACEI,135000,138890,Particles that we see in our atoms measures are dots.
bUmULlGACEI,138890,140172,"But if I had a super microscope,"
bUmULlGACEI,140172,144910,I could see that that dot is actually a rubber band.
bUmULlGACEI,144910,148030,"From a distance, this rubber band looks like a dot."
bUmULlGACEI,148030,151400,"Close up, you see that it's a vibrating string."
bUmULlGACEI,151400,154840,"Now, this rubber band can vibrate in many different modes."
bUmULlGACEI,154840,158008,Each mode can be called a particle.
bUmULlGACEI,158008,161680,"So for example, this might be an electron."
bUmULlGACEI,161680,166500,"But if you twirl it in a different way, it becomes a quark."
bUmULlGACEI,166500,168300,"And if you twirl it this way,"
bUmULlGACEI,168300,169970,you have to give it a different name.
bUmULlGACEI,169970,171760,We call it a neutrino.
bUmULlGACEI,171760,175196,"Now, how many ways can one string vibrate?"
bUmULlGACEI,175196,179220,"The answer's obvious, an infinite number of vibrations"
bUmULlGACEI,179220,180928,on the same string.
bUmULlGACEI,180928,183252,"And so, we think that all the subatomic particles"
bUmULlGACEI,183252,186840,"of the universe, the quarks, the neutrinos,"
bUmULlGACEI,186840,189519,"the mesons, the protons, the neutrons,"
bUmULlGACEI,189520,191350,"there's a galaxy of these particles,"
bUmULlGACEI,191350,194580,they're nothing but musical notes on a tiny rubber band.
bUmULlGACEI,194580,197870,A rubber band so small that it looks like a dot.
bUmULlGACEI,197870,200080,"So, what is physics that we had to struggle with"
bUmULlGACEI,200080,201330,in high school?
bUmULlGACEI,201330,202708,"Physics is the harmonies,"
bUmULlGACEI,202708,205736,the harmonies of vibrating strings.
bUmULlGACEI,205736,209310,Physics tells us how these vibrations move.
bUmULlGACEI,209310,210459,What is chemistry?
bUmULlGACEI,210460,213356,Chemistry is when these strings bump into each other
bUmULlGACEI,213356,215936,and form molecules.
bUmULlGACEI,215936,220936,"Alex, @keranskesong asked, ""What is a quark?"""
bUmULlGACEI,221840,223172,What is O-M-G?
bUmULlGACEI,224400,225930,"- [Crew] Yeah, it's 'oh my God'."
bUmULlGACEI,225930,226762,- Oh.
bUmULlGACEI,226763,229980,"We think that inside the proton there are three quarks,"
bUmULlGACEI,229980,233832,"subatomic particles that make up the protons and neutrons,"
bUmULlGACEI,233832,236590,which in turn make up our universe.
bUmULlGACEI,236590,240792,"Here's a question from Rick, @Sojourner99."
bUmULlGACEI,240792,244092,"""We live in four dimensions, but can see three."
bUmULlGACEI,244092,246330,"How many dimensions are there?"""
bUmULlGACEI,246330,249600,Einstein says we live in a four dimensional world.
bUmULlGACEI,249600,253151,"We can go forward, backward, left, right, up, down."
bUmULlGACEI,253151,256091,And the fourth dimension is time.
bUmULlGACEI,256091,258207,"But now, we're beyond Einstein."
bUmULlGACEI,258207,260890,And we have to go beyond four dimensions
bUmULlGACEI,260890,264120,"to perhaps, let's say, 10, 11 dimensions."
bUmULlGACEI,264120,265527,"But, where are these other dimensions?"
bUmULlGACEI,265527,267950,We think they have curled up.
bUmULlGACEI,267950,270610,They're so small that you cannot enter them.
bUmULlGACEI,270610,272729,"But perhaps, we can feel their effects."
bUmULlGACEI,272730,275010,And where is this other dimension?
bUmULlGACEI,275010,277650,It is off the plane of your universe.
bUmULlGACEI,277650,280350,Perhaps a parallel universe hovering right
bUmULlGACEI,280350,281307,above your universe
bUmULlGACEI,281307,283811,"in another dimension that we cannot see or touch,"
bUmULlGACEI,283811,287260,but perhaps there's a gateway connecting them.
bUmULlGACEI,287260,289620,That gateway is the wormhole.
bUmULlGACEI,289620,292960,"It was Einstein himself, in 1935,"
bUmULlGACEI,292960,296130,"who introduced the concept of a wormhole,"
bUmULlGACEI,296130,300120,a gateway between higher dimensional universes.
bUmULlGACEI,300120,303199,"Well, the next question comes from jMozac,"
bUmULlGACEI,303200,305580,"who asked, ""The quantum universe,"
bUmULlGACEI,305580,309509,"was Einstein wrong about his theory of relativity?"""
bUmULlGACEI,309510,310530,Yes and no.
bUmULlGACEI,310530,312847,"There's a famous quote where Einstein said,"
bUmULlGACEI,312847,315889,"""The more successful the quantum theory gets,"
bUmULlGACEI,315890,317667,"the sillier it looks."""
bUmULlGACEI,317667,319586,"He thought that atomic physics,"
bUmULlGACEI,319586,323166,"that is quantum mechanics, was incomplete."
bUmULlGACEI,323166,326137,"When the Nobel Prize was given to people like Heisenberg,"
bUmULlGACEI,326137,329290,"he said, ""Yes, give them the Nobel Prize."
bUmULlGACEI,329290,330680,"They're on to something."""
bUmULlGACEI,330680,332798,"And so, Einstein had reservations"
bUmULlGACEI,332799,336000,about the quantum theory as the final theory.
bUmULlGACEI,336000,337802,"He thought there had to be a higher theory,"
bUmULlGACEI,337802,341270,a theory even beyond the quantum theory.
bUmULlGACEI,341270,343887,"So, Einstein was not totally incorrect."
bUmULlGACEI,343887,348887,"Obi Uchenna Laing asked, ""What is the God equation?"""
bUmULlGACEI,349690,353890,"Well, Einstein spent the last 30 years of his life chasing"
bUmULlGACEI,353890,355880,"after the God equation,"
bUmULlGACEI,355880,359529,an equation perhaps no more than one inch long
bUmULlGACEI,359529,364060,"that would allow us to ""read the mind of God,"""
bUmULlGACEI,364060,367136,a theory that would unite the two branches of physics.
bUmULlGACEI,367136,369979,"On one hand, we have the theory of the big,"
bUmULlGACEI,369980,373150,"general relativity, black holes, big bangs,"
bUmULlGACEI,373150,377445,"and the theory of the small, quantum theory, atomic physics."
bUmULlGACEI,377446,381620,How can you unite these two into one theory?
bUmULlGACEI,381620,385220,"At the present time, these two theories hate each other."
bUmULlGACEI,385220,386655,"They're based on different mathematics,"
bUmULlGACEI,386655,389730,"different principles, different concepts."
bUmULlGACEI,389730,391988,"And yet we believe, in our heart of hearts,"
bUmULlGACEI,391988,394760,"there has to be a master theory out there,"
bUmULlGACEI,394760,397939,the holy grail of physics.
bUmULlGACEI,397939,400900,And that we think is the God equation.
bUmULlGACEI,400900,404919,The leading and only candidate for that is string theory.
bUmULlGACEI,404920,408070,"And by the way, if you ever find the God equation,"
bUmULlGACEI,408070,409240,tell me first.
bUmULlGACEI,409240,412780,"We'll split the Nobel Prize money together, you and me."
bUmULlGACEI,412780,415413,Here's a question from Princeton University Press.
bUmULlGACEI,415413,418780,"And that it is, ""Who is your favorite physicist?"""
bUmULlGACEI,418780,423649,46.2% said that Einstein was their favorite physicist.
bUmULlGACEI,423649,428649,53.8% thought that Richard Feynman was
bUmULlGACEI,429100,430540,their favorite physicist.
bUmULlGACEI,430540,433980,My favorite physicist is Isaac Newton.
bUmULlGACEI,433980,435972,He asked the question for the ages.
bUmULlGACEI,435972,440313,"If an apple falls, does the moon also fall?"
bUmULlGACEI,440313,442676,And he realized that he didn't have the mathematics
bUmULlGACEI,442676,445120,to calculate a falling moon.
bUmULlGACEI,445120,445975,"So, what did he do?"
bUmULlGACEI,445976,450150,He invented his own mathematics called calculus.
bUmULlGACEI,450150,453283,"And the theory was one of the greatest theories of all time,"
bUmULlGACEI,453283,456120,Newton's law of gravity.
bUmULlGACEI,456120,459374,"And so, during the Black Plague of 1666,"
bUmULlGACEI,459374,464374,one of the greatest minds in history went from superstition
bUmULlGACEI,464600,468180,"and thrust us into the age of mechanics,"
bUmULlGACEI,468180,469940,the industrial revolution.
bUmULlGACEI,469940,473250,He changed world history. You can't beat that.
bUmULlGACEI,473250,476210,Einstein is way up there. So is Richard Feynman.
bUmULlGACEI,476210,478061,"But, Isaac Newton tops them all."
bUmULlGACEI,478062,482317,"The next question comes from Hassan Babaji who asks,"
bUmULlGACEI,482317,484599,"""Can light bend around corners?"
bUmULlGACEI,484599,487490,"If yes or no, give one reason."""
bUmULlGACEI,487490,490360,"Yes, light can bend and around corners."
bUmULlGACEI,490360,493820,"In fact, that's why we have glass inside your glasses."
bUmULlGACEI,493821,498160,"When light goes into glass, it slows down slightly."
bUmULlGACEI,498160,501150,"Because it slows down, it deviates from a straight line."
bUmULlGACEI,501150,504240,"And that's why we have your glasses, telescopes,"
bUmULlGACEI,504240,507389,"microscopes, because glass bends light."
bUmULlGACEI,507390,511440,"Also, gravity can bend light, as Einstein showed us."
bUmULlGACEI,511440,513669,And we can actually see the bending of light
bUmULlGACEI,513669,515839,as it goes around a galaxy.
bUmULlGACEI,515840,517300,"Then the next question is,"
bUmULlGACEI,517300,520820,can you bend light completely around an object
bUmULlGACEI,520820,523280,so the object becomes invisible?
bUmULlGACEI,523280,524934,And the answer is yes.
bUmULlGACEI,524934,527150,It's well within the laws of physics
bUmULlGACEI,527150,531680,"that if you could govern the atomic structure sure of glass,"
bUmULlGACEI,531680,533540,then light would bend
bUmULlGACEI,533540,538050,in a way such that it would completely go around an object.
bUmULlGACEI,538050,541180,so anything inside that object becomes invisible.
bUmULlGACEI,541180,543670,"One day, we will build a meta material"
bUmULlGACEI,543670,547888,out of nanotechnology that will bend visible light so that
bUmULlGACEI,547888,552888,anything inside that capsule will become invisible.

bUmULlGACEI,575110,579649,"The heavier the planet, the slower time beats."

bUmULlGACEI,440313,442676,And he realized that he didn't have the mathematics
bUmULlGACEI,442676,445120,to calculate a falling moon.
bUmULlGACEI,445120,445975,"So, what did he do?"
bUmULlGACEI,445976,450150,He invented his own mathematics called calculus.
bUmULlGACEI,450150,453283,"And the theory was one of the greatest theories of all time,"
bUmULlGACEI,453283,456120,Newton's law of gravity.
bUmULlGACEI,456120,459374,"And so, during the Black Plague of 1666,"
bUmULlGACEI,459374,464374,one of the greatest minds in history went from superstition

bUmULlGACEI,487490,490360,"Yes, light can bend and around corners."
bUmULlGACEI,490360,493820,"In fact, that's why we have glass inside your glasses."
bUmULlGACEI,493821,498160,"When light goes into glass, it slows down slightly."
bUmULlGACEI,498160,501150,"Because it slows down, it deviates from a straight line."
bUmULlGACEI,501150,504240,"And that's why we have your glasses, telescopes,"
bUmULlGACEI,504240,507389,"microscopes, because glass bends light."
bUmULlGACEI,507390,511440,"Also, gravity can bend light, as Einstein showed us."
bUmULlGACEI,511440,513669,And we can actually see the bending of light
bUmULlGACEI,513669,515839,as it goes around a galaxy.
bUmULlGACEI,515840,517300,"Then the next question is,"
bUmULlGACEI,517300,520820,can you bend light completely around an object
bUmULlGACEI,520820,523280,so the object becomes invisible?
bUmULlGACEI,523280,524934,And the answer is yes.
bUmULlGACEI,524934,527150,It's well within the laws of physics
bUmULlGACEI,527150,531680,"that if you could govern the atomic structure sure of glass,"
bUmULlGACEI,531680,533540,then light would bend
bUmULlGACEI,533540,538050,in a way such that it would completely go around an object.
bUmULlGACEI,538050,541180,so anything inside that object becomes invisible.
bUmULlGACEI,541180,543670,"One day, we will build a meta material"
