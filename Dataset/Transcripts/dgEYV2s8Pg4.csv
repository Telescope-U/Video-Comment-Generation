dgEYV2s8Pg4,214980,217830,What's the point of biodiversity in the first place?
dgEYV2s8Pg4,217830,220260,I like to answer that in three ways
dgEYV2s8Pg4,220260,223530,by using different sorts of cartoon characters.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,223530,226230,"The first comes to us from ""Spider-Man"","
dgEYV2s8Pg4,226230,228840,where the theme is with great power

dgEYV2s8Pg4,234537,235920,"and other species,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,235920,238770,many people believe we have a responsibility

dgEYV2s8Pg4,595620,597870,"which fly low over the roads,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,597870,600630,and often hunt along the margins of roads
dgEYV2s8Pg4,600630,604477,that are particularly vulnerable to being struck by cars.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,604477,606127,"@EdoVreeker asks,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,606127,610140,"""Question for biologists/biophysicists!"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,610140,613490,"During a break, we found this mutated daisy outside."
dgEYV2s8Pg4,613490,616709,"To me, this seems like a beneficial form of the daisy:"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,616710,619860,"larger flower, larger chance of pollination."
dgEYV2s8Pg4,619860,622860,Why did a smaller flower and not this mutation
dgEYV2s8Pg4,622860,625470,"become the standard form of the flower?"""
dgEYV2s8Pg4,625470,627569,What you have discovered is an example
dgEYV2s8Pg4,627570,630450,"of what botanist would call fasciation,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,630450,633510,which is a change in the growing tissues of the plant
dgEYV2s8Pg4,633510,635850,"that cause that sort of a deformity,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,635850,639120,"and it can be triggered by an infection,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,639120,642600,it can be triggered by damage to the tissues.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,642600,644970,"But the reason that it won't be passed down,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,644970,647490,the reason that you won't see a lot of daisies
dgEYV2s8Pg4,647490,648510,"looking like that,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,648510,651570,"becoming the dominant form for daisies is that,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,651570,655230,it is not inherited from one generation to the next.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,655230,658649,"You get the occasional daisy with that sort of growth form,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,658650,660276,but it's not passed down.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,660276,664500,"@FuturesGate asks, ""What's the oldest tree in existence?"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,664500,666570,"What's the oldest tree ever recorded?"""
dgEYV2s8Pg4,666570,669120,"Well, the oldest individual trees"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,669120,672900,are certain bristlecone pine in California
dgEYV2s8Pg4,672900,676710,and Patagonian cypresses that have been known to live
dgEYV2s8Pg4,676710,678870,"for 5,000 years."
dgEYV2s8Pg4,678870,681420,"But there are also clonal trees,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,681420,684660,"things like certain Aspens or Oaks,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,684660,687930,where they are genetic clones of one another
dgEYV2s8Pg4,687930,689220,living in a grove.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,689220,692459,"So while individual trunks may die off,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,692460,697460,the whole organism can live for tens of thousands of years.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,697590,701070,"@ekarismi asks, ""Okay. Random thought."
dgEYV2s8Pg4,701070,702780,Are tomatoes really fruits?
dgEYV2s8Pg4,702780,704880,"Then ketchup would be smoothies, right?"""
dgEYV2s8Pg4,704880,707520,"The answer is yes, tomatoes are fruits."
dgEYV2s8Pg4,707520,710610,And we know this because tomatoes have seeds.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,710610,713579,And fruits evolved for the sole purpose
dgEYV2s8Pg4,713580,717420,of luring animal dispersers like us
dgEYV2s8Pg4,717420,720560,into moving fruits away from the parent plant
dgEYV2s8Pg4,720560,724350,"to a new location, where those seeds might sprout and grow."
dgEYV2s8Pg4,724350,727110,So if you are in the produce aisle
dgEYV2s8Pg4,727110,729120,"and you see something that has seeds,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,729120,733980,"whether it is a green pepper or a zucchini or a squash,"
dgEYV2s8Pg4,733980,736620,you know that it must be a fruit.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,736620,739740,So those are all the questions that we have for today.
dgEYV2s8Pg4,739740,742020,A wonderful mixture of topics.
