TYU1AE3rVQU,0,6799,[Music]  you and i want to know what it takes to  be happy  we have to understand what is our
TYU1AE3rVQU,6799,13120,current blueprint  of how our life's supposed to be now  what do we mean by blueprint well  we have a story in our head of how
TYU1AE3rVQU,13120,19279,life's supposed to be some people's  story is  you work hard in school you become  really great you're a nice person you're
TYU1AE3rVQU,19279,24320,a good person  and then you grow up and you take care  of yourself and you find the ideal man
TYU1AE3rVQU,24320,29920,and you fall in love and you have a  white picket fence and you have three  perfect children  and you live happily ever after somebody
TYU1AE3rVQU,29920,34960,else's story the old story was you work  really hard in school you  excel in college you go to work for a
TYU1AE3rVQU,34960,40559,big corporation  and you move up through the ranks until  you're the president or chairman of the  company
TYU1AE3rVQU,40559,47200,and you become successful and respected  throughout life these are some old  stories  obviously the stories that we hear today
TYU1AE3rVQU,47200,54559,of what people's lives are supposed to  be like are completely diverse  we no longer have these little  archetypes but one archetype still seems
TYU1AE3rVQU,54559,60480,to remain  and that archetype is in order for you  to really feel like you're enough
TYU1AE3rVQU,60480,66880,many people believe they have to achieve  an enormous amount  they may do it in different ways they  may do it by building a company and
TYU1AE3rVQU,66880,73280,taking it public  when they're 27 or 25 years old or you  know they  find and create a new technology or they
TYU1AE3rVQU,73280,79680,become a very special doctor but  we live in a culture in the west that  teaches people  that you're not enough unless you do
TYU1AE3rVQU,79680,86320,something really special and unique and  we define special and unique and  interesting ways  a school teacher is not special and
TYU1AE3rVQU,86320,93280,unique  a mother who stays home with her  children day and night  sculpting their minds their bodies their
TYU1AE3rVQU,93280,99840,souls and their future is not special  we live in a world today where we treat  teachers like their nobody and pay them
TYU1AE3rVQU,99840,106000,accordingly we wonder why our children  seem to have challenges of learning and  growing or being engaged in school
TYU1AE3rVQU,106000,112799,we spend thousands of dollars on some  item like a computer  but what we look at overall we invest in
TYU1AE3rVQU,112799,119280,for the teacher and for that person  who's the personal connection with them  is so small  we live in a society where many women
TYU1AE3rVQU,119280,125200,look down and say well you're just a  housewife you're just a mother  see some of the pain we have in our
TYU1AE3rVQU,125200,131360,society is not because there's one right  or one wrong approach but because we try  to make everybody fit into some
TYU1AE3rVQU,131360,136560,particular approach to life here's  what's going to make you happy or make  you unhappy in life it's real simple
TYU1AE3rVQU,136560,143200,let's do a quick test  if you're in a situation right now where  you look at your life i know there's an
TYU1AE3rVQU,143200,149360,area of your life that you probably feel  pretty darn good about  even if you're not happy with your  finances i bet you feel damn good close
TYU1AE3rVQU,149360,155519,to your kids  or if you're not close to your kids  maybe you don't have any kids maybe you  feel really good about your career
TYU1AE3rVQU,155519,161519,if you're doing not so good in your  career maybe you got a really great body  that you've  trimmed down or strengthened up or you
TYU1AE3rVQU,161519,167920,know you really shaped yourself the way  you want muscularly or in the way you  look  or if that's not happening maybe you  feel a really special connection with
TYU1AE3rVQU,167920,173440,god  or really close to your mother or father  your family whatever  almost everybody has an area of their
TYU1AE3rVQU,173440,179360,life they feel really good about if  they're honest  and if they're fair to themselves what's  an area of your life you really feel
TYU1AE3rVQU,179360,185280,happy about  i want you to think about it for a  moment truthfully what's an area in your  life today that if you wanted to be
TYU1AE3rVQU,185280,190400,happy about it you really could feel  proud about it you could feel like  scenario you're doing darn well in and
TYU1AE3rVQU,190400,195519,if you're really hard on yourself  there's still  an area what's an area i want you to  think of it right now
TYU1AE3rVQU,195519,201599,and once you think of that area whether  it's your body or your finances or your  career  or your intimate relationship or your
TYU1AE3rVQU,201599,207040,relationship with your kids your  relationship with your creator  whatever it is i want you to think about
TYU1AE3rVQU,207040,212319,why are you happy with that area of your  life  right now today why are you happy with
TYU1AE3rVQU,212319,217519,that area of your life right now today  really think about it  if you're in a seminar with me i'd have
TYU1AE3rVQU,217519,224000,you write this down and if you can you  can put me on hold here for a second  because i'd like to reveal to you what
TYU1AE3rVQU,224000,230720,the formula is for happiness and if i  say there's a formula for happiness and  here's what it is you're going to go  yeah yeah sure that's what he says
TYU1AE3rVQU,230720,236000,but if you put down the answer and we  can see the formula is real without me  telling you what it is
TYU1AE3rVQU,236000,241760,you get to look at your own life and say  it matches you're going to know this is  right so you could stop this  right now if you want put me on hold and
TYU1AE3rVQU,241760,248640,just write down what's an area of your  life you're really really happy about  you're really pleased with or you could  be if you wanted to focus on it
TYU1AE3rVQU,248640,254640,and why are you happy with that part of  your life right now even if you're not  happy with everything what's the area  you're happy with and why
TYU1AE3rVQU,254640,260720,put me on hold right now or if you're  not going to do that  just think for a moment why specifically
TYU1AE3rVQU,260720,266240,be real why  now when i ask this if you turn me back  on now
TYU1AE3rVQU,266240,272639,if i ask this of an audience i'll have  people write this down for a few minutes  and i'll call them people and i'll say  share with the person next to you first
TYU1AE3rVQU,272639,278240,what are you happy about and why are you  happy in that area and be specific  and after they share i'll have people  stand up i'll call on a variety of
TYU1AE3rVQU,278240,284320,people and i say  ma'am tell me what are you happy about  and she'll say well honestly  i'm really happy with my body she goes i
TYU1AE3rVQU,284320,290080,never thought i'd say that  but i used to be so unhappy with it and  you know i finally i did some things i
TYU1AE3rVQU,290080,296720,pushed myself through and now i exercise  regularly and  you know i'm not perfect but i feel fit  i feel strong i feel energetic
TYU1AE3rVQU,296720,301840,and that's really i don't know it just  feels good to me  now i say to everybody i'm not going to
TYU1AE3rVQU,301840,307039,show you what the formula for happiness  is and it's real simple i want to reveal  it to you so you don't ever forget it
TYU1AE3rVQU,307039,313280,whenever you're happy with an area of  your life it's because  right now your current life experience i
TYU1AE3rVQU,313280,319520,call it your lc your life conditions  the conditions of your life your life  conditions in that area
TYU1AE3rVQU,319520,325759,match or equal to your blueprint  your story your belief about how life
TYU1AE3rVQU,325759,332320,should be in that area  so this woman says to me i'm really  happy with my body because it's not  perfect her blueprint is i don't need to
TYU1AE3rVQU,332320,337360,be perfect  but it's so much better than it was i'm  fit and i'm strong and i have this
TYU1AE3rVQU,337360,342800,energy  her mental blueprint says i should be  fit strong and have energy i don't need
TYU1AE3rVQU,342800,348479,to be perfect but i should be that way  well when my life my body matches how i  think it should be
TYU1AE3rVQU,348479,354080,i feel good about my life i'll ask  somebody else i'll say you know tell me  an area you're happy with someone else  say well
TYU1AE3rVQU,354080,359919,i'm really happy with my career and why  well i'm doing better than i even  thought i would be i mean i'm ahead of
TYU1AE3rVQU,359919,365440,the schedule of where i hoped i'd be at  this stage  i'm working at this level in this  company and i have these skills and this
TYU1AE3rVQU,365440,372160,ability  and it's even better than i thought well  once again listen this person's happy  with this area of their life because
TYU1AE3rVQU,372160,377680,their current life conditions in the  area called their career  are even better than they expected they
TYU1AE3rVQU,377680,383199,would be better than their blueprint  better than their belief of how how it  should be
TYU1AE3rVQU,383199,388880,if it's really better you tend to be  over the moon  well one woman would say you know i kind
TYU1AE3rVQU,388880,395520,of tell you i said  i'm the happiest ever been in my whole  life how come she goes because i have  this man in my life and i'm in love with
TYU1AE3rVQU,395520,402479,him and he loves me  and i can be myself with him and he we  have this incredible  intimacy and this passion and we want to
TYU1AE3rVQU,402479,408000,be with each other all the time  and i never get bored with him well  what's her blueprint
TYU1AE3rVQU,408000,413120,you want to be with somebody that you  can have total intimacy with somebody  who  you love and loves you those are part of
TYU1AE3rVQU,413120,418800,her rules her beliefs of how it should  be  she said you know it needs to be i never  want to be with anybody else i want to
TYU1AE3rVQU,418800,423919,be with them every moment  her blueprint about how life should be  and the way she lives
TYU1AE3rVQU,423919,431840,her relationships even better than she  hoped when it's better than you hope  you're going to be  totally excited so think about this then
TYU1AE3rVQU,431840,437039,what's an area you're not happy with  let's see if we can find the formula for  unhappiness
TYU1AE3rVQU,437039,442160,if the formula for happiness is to be  able to meet your expectations or exceed  them that
TYU1AE3rVQU,442160,448160,really makes you excited but to be happy  at least meet it doesn't have to be  perfect  but if you generally are meeting what
TYU1AE3rVQU,448160,454960,you expect you want from your life in  that area you feel good  life conditions match blueprint feel  good so what makes you feel bad
TYU1AE3rVQU,454960,460880,what creates pain stress frustration  real easy way to figure it out answer
TYU1AE3rVQU,460880,466319,this question  what's an area of your life you're not  happy with let me be honest with  yourself
TYU1AE3rVQU,466319,472319,and even if your life is great all kinds  of ways i'm sure there's an area you'd  like to improve  anybody who's honest if they're doing
TYU1AE3rVQU,472319,478080,great in their career  very often don't take care of their body  so much if they're really focused on  their body
TYU1AE3rVQU,478080,484000,you know very often they find themselves  in a position where they're not spending  enough time with their kids  or if they're spending time with their
TYU1AE3rVQU,484000,489440,kids their intimate relationships not  doing so well because it's the nature of  human beings to focus on areas they feel
TYU1AE3rVQU,489440,495680,comfortable with  and strong in and give those time in the  areas they don't feel so strong and they  go i don't have time for it what they're
TYU1AE3rVQU,495680,500960,really saying is i don't feel very  confident in that area  so what's an area of your life that you
TYU1AE3rVQU,500960,506000,are not as happy with  i mean it's healthy honestly to look at  areas and say i don't like it i want
TYU1AE3rVQU,506000,513039,more this whole concept of a  breakthrough is about how do i close the  gap  between where i am right now and where i
TYU1AE3rVQU,513039,518320,want to be  that's what we're here to do is like  here's where i want to be here's where i  am it's healthy to see there's a gap
TYU1AE3rVQU,518320,524080,that makes me have this hunger this  drive to grow to feel alive to expand as  a human being
TYU1AE3rVQU,524080,530880,so what's an area you're not pleased  with is it your body  is it your finances is it your career is
TYU1AE3rVQU,530880,537440,it your spiritual life or lack thereof  in terms of feeling connected  in that area is it your kids
TYU1AE3rVQU,537440,544320,what's the area what's the area that's  not where you want it to be  and then answer for a moment why aren't
TYU1AE3rVQU,544320,549600,you happy with that area of your life  right now  specifically today are you not happy
TYU1AE3rVQU,549600,554959,with that area of your life at this  stage of your time of your life  again you can stop this and write it
TYU1AE3rVQU,554959,560240,down might be useful for you  or if you're going to keep it running  stop it and you'll turn it right back on
TYU1AE3rVQU,560240,565920,and i'll kick into it do that now  or if you kept it running then just i'll  give you what happens i have people
TYU1AE3rVQU,565920,572240,write this down  and they don't like this exercise so  much well i don't like my body or i  don't like my finances i don't like my
TYU1AE3rVQU,572240,577600,career  i don't like the person i'm in a  relationship with i don't like myself  the way i'm in relationships
TYU1AE3rVQU,577600,582640,why they write it all down how people  share back and forth i call on people
TYU1AE3rVQU,582640,587760,and the lesson is pretty clear i tell  people in advance here's the formula for  unhappiness
TYU1AE3rVQU,587760,592800,i'll show you before you do anything  else when your life conditions when your  life conditions the way you're living
TYU1AE3rVQU,592800,600640,your life today  does not match it doesn't equal  your blueprint your story of how it's
TYU1AE3rVQU,600640,606880,supposed to be  then you're gonna have disappointment  frustration or pain  if your life is way different than the
TYU1AE3rVQU,606880,612399,way you think it's supposed to be  you can have enormous pain if it's a  little different you might feel stressed
TYU1AE3rVQU,612399,618720,make sense so people stand up and i say  tell me  you know what's the area you're not  happy with the person says well you know
TYU1AE3rVQU,618720,624720,i'm really not happy with my finances  and i go why and they say because i'm  doing worse now than i was five years  ago
TYU1AE3rVQU,624720,630160,i made mistakes in the market and at  this stage of my life i should have this  much money and i don't have it and i
TYU1AE3rVQU,630160,635680,don't know how to change it  and it's making me crazy and why are  they crazy you say well because they
TYU1AE3rVQU,635680,641600,don't have their economic needs met  no you cannot have your economic needs  met and you can still be okay
TYU1AE3rVQU,641600,647040,but when you have an idea this is what  my need is and i did the wrong thing
TYU1AE3rVQU,647040,654560,my life doesn't match how i'm supposed  to be that's when people get a little  crazy  see think about it if you grew up
TYU1AE3rVQU,654560,659680,taking care of folding your own clothes  making your own meals  going to the store doing the grocery
TYU1AE3rVQU,659680,666560,shopping cleaning the bedroom cleaning  the house vacuuming taking out the trash  and you did that your whole life then if
TYU1AE3rVQU,666560,672959,you have to do that later on you don't  feel like you have economic pain because  you don't have a maid  but if you grew up an environment where
TYU1AE3rVQU,672959,679040,everything was done for you you never  have to work  and now suddenly you have to work  incredibly hard to just pay enough money
TYU1AE3rVQU,679040,685680,to pay your bills and  all of a sudden food is building up and  the house is dirty and  your clothes aren't folded and nothing
TYU1AE3rVQU,685680,692240,matches you might find yourself really  angry and frustrated because you have a  different story about how life's  supposed to be than how it is
TYU1AE3rVQU,692240,699519,someone else will say well i'll tell you  why because  i'm in a situation now where you know  i'm 30 pounds heavier than i should be
TYU1AE3rVQU,699519,707200,should be the key word there are people  there are people in all cultures  who love being big there are people that
TYU1AE3rVQU,707200,715440,walk around and someone else might think  they're massively overweight but they'll  go i own this honey and they  really truly they match their blueprint
TYU1AE3rVQU,715440,721839,big is beautiful because their idea is  big is beautiful i'm big  that's beautiful matches my blueprint
TYU1AE3rVQU,721839,729040,rock and roll i'm happy as can be  somebody else can look like a twig and  be stressed out saying i hate my body
TYU1AE3rVQU,729040,734160,because their blueprint says i should be  the skinniest thing on earth and i'm not  skinny enough
TYU1AE3rVQU,734160,740399,am i making sense when your life  conditions don't match your blueprint  you're going to have pain but here's
TYU1AE3rVQU,740399,745839,when you suffer  when i ask people who here has been  through the dark night of the soul
TYU1AE3rVQU,745839,752880,who's been here in a situation where you  feel like  like like life life isn't worth living
TYU1AE3rVQU,752880,760160,or we feel like a pain that just will  never go away  a lot of people write down those  experiences like joaquin
TYU1AE3rVQU,760160,765440,so you'll begin to understand what the  issue is i'm talking about here  joaquin if you recall was in a situation
TYU1AE3rVQU,765440,770839,where this man felt like  there was no reason to live he couldn't  work he couldn't do anything his life  was
TYU1AE3rVQU,770839,777600,worthless why did he think that because  he had a blueprint  his blueprint said i need to be an nba
TYU1AE3rVQU,777600,783839,basketball player at least a  professional basketball player  i need to be able to make money and have  this great lifestyle
TYU1AE3rVQU,783839,788959,because that's what makes me worthwhile  as a human being  that's what makes my family respect me
TYU1AE3rVQU,788959,795519,my mother my  my uncles my aunts i'm the successful  one in the family and i make the money i
TYU1AE3rVQU,795519,801279,support everybody  he's a good man he didn't come just to  be successful he took care of his mother  his families
TYU1AE3rVQU,801279,806720,he tried to be an inspiration for people  joaquin hawkins is a man who was always  going out on his free time and
TYU1AE3rVQU,806720,812800,training kids and showing them the  pathway to freedom  how they could play basketball and get  free like he did and get out of the
TYU1AE3rVQU,812800,818160,inner city so this man is not a selfish  man  but he knew this is the way to be
TYU1AE3rVQU,818160,823199,worthwhile this is the way to be able to  give to people this is the way to take  care of your family
TYU1AE3rVQU,823199,829600,and all of a sudden one night what  happened that way was taken from him he  has a stroke
TYU1AE3rVQU,829600,836320,in the middle of the night his life  conditions make it impossible  to be who he has to be or he feels like
TYU1AE3rVQU,836320,841360,he's worthless  you get it we have an identity
TYU1AE3rVQU,841360,847760,we have a a story of how we're supposed  to be and if life somehow gets in the  way of that story
TYU1AE3rVQU,847760,853760,we feel pain but if we feel we have no  control  that's when we go into suffering see
TYU1AE3rVQU,853760,859279,it's one thing to say my life doesn't  match my  blueprint i gotta lose weight that might  stress you out
TYU1AE3rVQU,859279,865839,or my life doesn't match my blueprint  i'm not in a relationship i gotta get in  one  that might motivate you even you might
TYU1AE3rVQU,865839,871199,not like it but you're gonna find a way  to get one  or my career doesn't matter how i should  be you could change it
TYU1AE3rVQU,871199,878639,but when you start believing that your  life doesn't match your blueprint  and you have no control to change it
TYU1AE3rVQU,878639,883760,you're helpless  that's when people suffer and so this  week
TYU1AE3rVQU,883760,890880,for your breakthrough it's a chance for  you to start to take a look at your  blueprint  anywhere you're really having pain hey
TYU1AE3rVQU,890880,896000,look if you're doing great in some area  of your life  celebrate it of course and i'm sure  there are many areas you are
TYU1AE3rVQU,896000,901199,but life is really a series of growth  spurts  i mean two things in life make you feel
TYU1AE3rVQU,901199,906480,alive  growing and giving and what's really  wonderful about this man joaquin is
TYU1AE3rVQU,906480,912399,he was constantly growing trying to get  better trying to be a better teammate a  better basketball player  think about it when he didn't make the
TYU1AE3rVQU,912399,918000,teams he didn't make the nba he didn't  give up he worked even harder  the guy was always striving striving to
TYU1AE3rVQU,918000,924639,become  something and he became it and he  achieved it  and then life took it from him isn't
TYU1AE3rVQU,924639,929680,that the common denominator with so many  of the people  and the stories of this six part series
TYU1AE3rVQU,929680,936000,that you saw these six specials  i mean frank and kristen had a blueprint  of what life was supposed to be about
TYU1AE3rVQU,936000,941440,we're supposed to get married and have  children and we're gonna  have our own business and all of a
TYU1AE3rVQU,941440,948560,sudden  life doesn't match the blueprint and  suddenly  there's depression because in their case
TYU1AE3rVQU,948560,953680,they said there's nothing we could do  but they were wrong they were wrong  because they discovered
TYU1AE3rVQU,953680,960800,and frank discovered i can make a  difference to my wife the chair even  though i didn't create this and didn't  ask for it this chair does not define me
TYU1AE3rVQU,960800,967440,i can become more than i was before i  can have the impact with my wife  i can have children we had to change his
TYU1AE3rVQU,967440,973199,blueprint  because we couldn't change all the  conditions of his life does that make  sense i couldn't
TYU1AE3rVQU,973199,979120,get him to physically walk again maybe  someday he will but we can't count on  that what we got to count on is that he  can be fulfilled
TYU1AE3rVQU,979120,985360,by seeing he isn't helpless and i did  that through a series of experiences  that violated what he thought he
TYU1AE3rVQU,985360,992320,couldn't do the same thing was true with  almost every one of the people we worked  with at some level  and in joaquin's example it was also
TYU1AE3rVQU,992320,998800,true  joaquin said well i can't ever have this  quality of life again because i'm not a  professional basketball player
TYU1AE3rVQU,998800,1006720,and he was locked into that mindset and  all of us get locked at times  but to his credit to a system of steps
TYU1AE3rVQU,1006720,1012240,we were able to break him out of that we  get him to see that he isn't helpless  because here's your choice watch this
TYU1AE3rVQU,1012240,1018800,now if you're suffering if you're in  pain  your life doesn't match how you think it  should be and
TYU1AE3rVQU,1018800,1026798,you think you're helpless to change it  now you have only three choices  choice one blame something and that's
TYU1AE3rVQU,1026798,1032240,what joaquin did if you recall  he blamed his coach he blamed what  happened to him and
TYU1AE3rVQU,1032240,1037438,of course these things were outside his  control but he blamed his coach and a  big part of the healing if you watch the
TYU1AE3rVQU,1037438,1043760,session was bringing his coach in and  getting him to see  hey you know what all that anger all  that resentment inside of you joaquin
TYU1AE3rVQU,1043760,1050960,a it's not based on the truth and b like  nelson mandela said you know  having resentment in your soul is like
TYU1AE3rVQU,1050960,1056000,drinking poison and hoping that your  enemy will die  it doesn't work that way and when
TYU1AE3rVQU,1056000,1062080,joaquin was able to  break out his breakthrough was a change  in perception to realize this coach  wasn't stopping me
TYU1AE3rVQU,1062080,1067120,i just felt like i lost everything and  so i don't know how to change it so  i'm looking for something to be mad
TYU1AE3rVQU,1067120,1073280,about someone to blame so  so i don't have to blame myself or i  don't have to feel so helpless  because when you're angry you don't feel
TYU1AE3rVQU,1073280,1080080,so helpless you feel strong for the  moment even though it's a fake strength  when he was able to make that  breakthrough he could stop
TYU1AE3rVQU,1080080,1087840,blaming because these are three choices  when life doesn't match how you think it  should be  blame something an event someone else
TYU1AE3rVQU,1087840,1093520,or yourself as we talked about earlier  in the series  blame games just destroy you there's no
TYU1AE3rVQU,1093520,1100960,progress when you blame for the moment  you feel okay but nothing changes what  are your real choices  you only have two choices in life if
TYU1AE3rVQU,1100960,1106799,life doesn't match your blueprint  you either have to change your life that  is you gotta say you know what my body
TYU1AE3rVQU,1106799,1112400,isn't there  i'm gonna go work out my relationship  isn't there i'm gonna change it  you know i'm not making what i gotta
TYU1AE3rVQU,1112400,1118000,make i'm gonna retool i'm gonna get a  new skill i'm gonna go back to school  i'm gonna start a business i'm gonna do  something
TYU1AE3rVQU,1118000,1123520,you have to do something to change your  life or  in order for you to be happy if you
TYU1AE3rVQU,1123520,1128640,can't change your life you're going to  have to change your blueprint  usually in life it requires a little bit
TYU1AE3rVQU,1128640,1134799,of each does that make sense  and if you change your take change your  life and change your blueprint you can
TYU1AE3rVQU,1134799,1142240,have an extraordinary life  and what you witnessed this man do was  once he let go of  his anger and his denial once he started
TYU1AE3rVQU,1142240,1148640,to look at things he began to find by  spending time with his family that  he was worthwhile being loved while he  played basketball or not of course he'd
TYU1AE3rVQU,1148640,1154480,love to play basketball but  professional basketball is no longer a  part of it and we got to get joaquin to
TYU1AE3rVQU,1154480,1160640,shift that  and joaquin is a metaphor for all of us  because all of us are going to have  times in our life
TYU1AE3rVQU,1160640,1166480,when what we want or think life should  be like isn't going to match how life  really is
TYU1AE3rVQU,1166480,1172160,those moments if we blame our life goes  into pain  if we change we can change our life and
TYU1AE3rVQU,1172160,1177440,match our blueprint  but we have to also know when it's not  within our control and that's how we're
TYU1AE3rVQU,1177440,1183360,able to make a shift and change  what our story is for our life what our  expectations are not by lowering them
TYU1AE3rVQU,1183360,1189280,but by changing what that model really  is  i hope this makes sense to you i'll give  you a great example
TYU1AE3rVQU,1189280,1194559,years ago i i do a lot of work with  business people celebrities people of  all kinds of walks of life
TYU1AE3rVQU,1194559,1201200,and i was dealing with a group of people  and they knew a very very powerful  celebrity  and without to give that person privacy
TYU1AE3rVQU,1201200,1206320,i won't tell you too many details who  can't figure exactly who it is  but it would be a person who was very
TYU1AE3rVQU,1206320,1213679,successful  as a woman uh who was extremely  attractive by cultural standards  uh a woman who's uh had a lot of dear
TYU1AE3rVQU,1213679,1219679,friends a lot of deep respect  um so great skill great ability  extremely talented
TYU1AE3rVQU,1219679,1225919,quite attractive quite wealthy in  financial terms  and lots of great friends this would be
TYU1AE3rVQU,1225919,1232159,for most people's idea the ultimate  blueprint if your life matches that  description you must have an incredible
TYU1AE3rVQU,1232159,1239600,life  but ironically this particular  individual as famous as they were  was depressed all the time they had
TYU1AE3rVQU,1239600,1245520,seemingly everything and yet the person  was depressed  how do you get depressed when you're
TYU1AE3rVQU,1245520,1250799,smart and you're strong and you're  beautiful and you've got great friends  and you're rich and you're famous
TYU1AE3rVQU,1250799,1256880,well it's real simple people said i  don't know what it is everyone's trying  to help her she's been on the through  counseling she's got all these different
TYU1AE3rVQU,1256880,1262000,drugs nothing's working  she's taking antidepressants and she's  still depressed which is not uncommon
TYU1AE3rVQU,1262000,1267280,by the way because if you change the way  you feel physically  but you still see your life doesn't
TYU1AE3rVQU,1267280,1273760,match how you think it should be at some  level  and you feel like you're helpless to  change it you're going to be depressed
TYU1AE3rVQU,1273760,1279600,so i said bring it to me i said i can  help her i know that sounds like  hyperbole but i absolutely can help her  well how do you know that tony because i
TYU1AE3rVQU,1279600,1284720,already know what the problem is  i know if someone's depressed it's  because they feel helpless
TYU1AE3rVQU,1284720,1290159,because their life doesn't match how  they think it should be i just don't  know what a blueprint is but we'll find  out what it is
TYU1AE3rVQU,1290159,1295280,and will either help her change her life  or help her change her blueprint or both
TYU1AE3rVQU,1295280,1301760,long story short and very quickly i'll  tell you the core of it  she came to me and she spent maybe the  first
TYU1AE3rVQU,1301760,1307280,half an hour telling me apologizing  saying i know i should be happier i know
TYU1AE3rVQU,1307280,1313120,it's silly for me to be depressed  i don't know why i'm so depressed i i  know i should be grateful for what i
TYU1AE3rVQU,1313120,1318400,have and i am grateful  it was all these reasons why she knows  she should feel good but still didn't i
TYU1AE3rVQU,1318400,1325440,try to finally explain to her listen i  don't  care about that i care about you  the fact that you're not happy has
TYU1AE3rVQU,1325440,1330880,nothing to do with what you have or  don't have  the fact that you're not happy is that  your life doesn't match the way you
TYU1AE3rVQU,1330880,1336000,think it should be  and you have some idea of how you think  it should be
TYU1AE3rVQU,1336000,1341360,and worse if you're this depressed after  all this time  you feel like you can't do anything you
TYU1AE3rVQU,1341360,1347919,have no power to change it you feel  helpless  and she looked at me in a certain way  and i said so what is that
TYU1AE3rVQU,1347919,1354080,what did you want your life to be like  she goes well it sounds stupid  i said that sounds stupid to me she said
TYU1AE3rVQU,1354080,1359360,well  i don't know i just always since i was a  little girl dreamed that i would be  married
TYU1AE3rVQU,1359360,1364400,and i would have three basically perfect  children  and they would love me totally and i
TYU1AE3rVQU,1364400,1370240,love my husband he'd love me and  i said okay so how's that working for  you so far and she said well i think you
TYU1AE3rVQU,1370240,1378320,know  because pretty famous person she said  i'm divorced twice  i have no children and you know i'm now
TYU1AE3rVQU,1378320,1385120,ex-age and to give you a clue that age  would be an age where  having a child your own natural child at
TYU1AE3rVQU,1385120,1388960,least  barring a medical miracle
TYU1AE3rVQU,1401120,1406320,the deeper desire or need so i said to  her i said well
TYU1AE3rVQU,1406320,1411520,what if you couldn't have the husband  but you could have the kids and she  smiled she said i take that
TYU1AE3rVQU,1411520,1417360,i said well why not adopt your kid she  goes no it has to be my own blood  children  so i kept digging to find out what was
TYU1AE3rVQU,1417360,1423520,behind her blueprint  because your blueprint is just a  projection of what you think you need to
TYU1AE3rVQU,1423520,1429360,be happy  but as human beings we're notoriously  ineffective at knowing it's going to  make us happy
TYU1AE3rVQU,1429360,1435360,so much that we think we're gonna make  us happily we get there and we go is  this all there is  so many things that we think are gonna  make us miserable and we can never deal
TYU1AE3rVQU,1435360,1440640,with we go through it we can handle it  we're not good at projecting these  things all kinds of studies will show
TYU1AE3rVQU,1440640,1446320,this  so i said to her well what what are you  hoping to get from these three children
TYU1AE3rVQU,1446320,1453120,why do they have to be your blood  children and she finally said well  if they're my blood children i know  they'll always love me they'll never
TYU1AE3rVQU,1453120,1458320,leave me what was she looking for  unconditional love she had this big
TYU1AE3rVQU,1458320,1464720,blueprint that said  white house picket pants three children  perfect husband you know all these  different things but what was behind
TYU1AE3rVQU,1464720,1470799,that was  a need a need to feel like she could  have love that would be certain and  wouldn't go away
TYU1AE3rVQU,1470799,1476159,so i can help her meet that need so i  said to her i said well  maybe one reason you don't have a
TYU1AE3rVQU,1476159,1482080,husband is because every time you look  at one you're trying to figure out if  he's going to get you those three kids  in time and how that's going to happen  and maybe he feels a little stressed
TYU1AE3rVQU,1482080,1487279,when he's  looking at him this way because he can  feel what's going on behind your bed  even if he doesn't know what the words
TYU1AE3rVQU,1487279,1492640,are and she started to laugh  she goes i guess i've probably been  there a good portion of my life
TYU1AE3rVQU,1492640,1497760,and she goes people wonder you know why  i'm so uptight  i say you're up tight because you felt
TYU1AE3rVQU,1497760,1504880,like you're running out of time  trying to meet some picture but i said  all you really want is love i said don't
TYU1AE3rVQU,1504880,1511279,you have a lot of love in your life  tell me about your friends and gradually  i got her to start seeing this love that
TYU1AE3rVQU,1511279,1516400,she was trying to get was already here  it didn't match the picture maybe  maybe we could paint a new picture of
TYU1AE3rVQU,1516400,1522080,what life could really be like and make  sure that picture met her deepest needs  that's basically what we did with
TYU1AE3rVQU,1522080,1528159,joaquin joaquin wanted to be  a professional basketball player because  he loved basketball yes but also because
TYU1AE3rVQU,1528159,1533840,he wanted to be that man who was a  leader he wanted to be a man who was the  good man he want to be the one who  brought energy to people
TYU1AE3rVQU,1533840,1540320,he wanted to be the man people would  look up to he want to be the man who  could take care of his family and style  all of his family not just his daughters
TYU1AE3rVQU,1540320,1546159,and his wife but other people as well  underneath it all he wanted to know that  he mattered
TYU1AE3rVQU,1546159,1551760,and through the process that you saw on  the show he began to find out that he  didn't need to be angry at the world
TYU1AE3rVQU,1551760,1557840,that yes his blueprint was taken from  him but his soul and his ability  to be a special human being that could
TYU1AE3rVQU,1557840,1564559,touch other people was not taken from  him  that maybe his real gift was his ability  to inspire young kids
TYU1AE3rVQU,1564559,1570320,his ability to get himself to do  whatever it took how to become a  professional basketball player  unbelievable
TYU1AE3rVQU,1570320,1576559,discipline unbelievable drive he started  bringing that to picking up trash and  the game started to change he started to
TYU1AE3rVQU,1576559,1581760,have fun there he could come home and  take care of his kids and pay his bills  that doesn't solve everything but it
TYU1AE3rVQU,1581760,1587520,gives him a way to suddenly regain  himself  when he sat around with all of his  family and you saw part of those scenes
TYU1AE3rVQU,1587520,1592640,and if you  watch little areas of browsing this week  you'll see some more scenes from his  family where
TYU1AE3rVQU,1592640,1598159,you see him begin to realize they love  me whether i'm rich or poor  they love me with a professional
TYU1AE3rVQU,1598159,1605120,basketball player not they love  me that's what he was really after  and when he got that it allowed him to
TYU1AE3rVQU,1605120,1610720,let go and say i can do other things  that doesn't mean he won't have  challenges we're all going to have  challenges in our life he
TYU1AE3rVQU,1610720,1617520,doesn't mean that at times he won't wish  he's doing more but he's no longer stuck  he's broken through because he now knows
TYU1AE3rVQU,1617520,1623679,i have control i can change my life or i  can change my blueprint  and when i do i can fulfill it i can
TYU1AE3rVQU,1623679,1628720,start to feel that aliveness  now here's the trap what do you think  happens
TYU1AE3rVQU,1628720,1634960,once you fulfill your blueprint  regularly once you figure out how to do  what you always dreamed of  you always dreamed to live a certain way
TYU1AE3rVQU,1634960,1640960,and now you're living that way living  that way living that way every day  well the human nervous system human  spirit needs to grow
TYU1AE3rVQU,1640960,1646240,so pretty soon you'll get bored with  that and you'll come up with a new  blueprint  that's part of the part of life that's
TYU1AE3rVQU,1646240,1652399,exciting see  if you and i from this day forward are  going to be happy just remember what  we've said it takes two things
TYU1AE3rVQU,1652399,1658799,grow and give a meaningful life comes  from growing that sense of progress  and it comes from having life not just
TYU1AE3rVQU,1658799,1665120,be about me but about we  doing something that makes me feel  connected to other people besides myself
TYU1AE3rVQU,1665120,1670480,that growth that sense of contribution  fills a deep spiritual need that we all  have
TYU1AE3rVQU,1670480,1676720,if you are unhappy in your life you got  three choices really two  blame that's not a choice it's not gonna
TYU1AE3rVQU,1676720,1684159,work don't blame someone else don't  blame the event don't blame yourself  just  figure out what you're going to do to  change your life that's my specialty if
TYU1AE3rVQU,1684159,1690480,you like my coaching or my team's  coaching come visit with us come to an  event come get a coach come to a program  and we'll guide you through it more than
TYU1AE3rVQU,1690480,1697360,just  a few minutes like this and we'll do it  directly in an environment that'll shift  you  or change your blueprint you're going to
TYU1AE3rVQU,1697360,1703440,have to rewire what's going on inside  and that's what we focus on as well  so i hope this journey has been an
TYU1AE3rVQU,1703440,1709360,interesting one for you i hope it's  opened up your eyes to what it takes to  go from where you are to where you want  to be
TYU1AE3rVQU,1709360,1716320,it takes changing your emotional pattern  a change bringing presence to your life  it takes realizing you have no problems
TYU1AE3rVQU,1716320,1722480,compared to somebody else and putting  your life in perspective  it takes the ability to deal with those  extreme stresses that happen in your
TYU1AE3rVQU,1722480,1728000,life  by questioning your limiting beliefs and  again if  we'd love to coach you and show you how
TYU1AE3rVQU,1728000,1733200,to change those in a permanent way where  it happens automatically just like  lifting weight so often till the muscle
TYU1AE3rVQU,1733200,1738320,is always there and you find yourself  able to follow through  it takes for you to be able to figure
TYU1AE3rVQU,1738320,1744559,out how to deal with crisis and how to  turn it around  it takes facing your fear it takes
TYU1AE3rVQU,1744559,1750080,pushing yourself through what used to  stop you  it takes putting yourself in a position  where you connect to what's more
TYU1AE3rVQU,1750080,1755760,important than just yourself what you  value than just  yourself and it takes i think in this  case also
TYU1AE3rVQU,1755760,1761279,the ability to realize that no matter  what happens to you  you're more than that moment you're more
TYU1AE3rVQU,1761279,1767279,than the story you think you're supposed  to be  and that even when you're not matching  what you think you need to be
TYU1AE3rVQU,1767279,1773760,maybe there's a reason for that maybe  you're having to find a different part  of yourself that's going to fulfill you  at a much deeper level
TYU1AE3rVQU,1773760,1779520,sometimes failing to get your goal gives  you your destiny  i can't tell you how many people i've
TYU1AE3rVQU,1779520,1784880,known over the years who had an idea of  what they thought their life was  supposed to be like  and they didn't achieve it they felt
TYU1AE3rVQU,1784880,1792080,miserable and upset and frustrated and  one day an opening happened and they  went  oh my god thank god that didn't happen i
TYU1AE3rVQU,1792080,1798080,think it's garth brooks had a great song  and it's a song about when he was in  high school and he was in love with this
TYU1AE3rVQU,1798080,1805600,girl infatuated with her and she didn't  even know that he existed  and he prayed to god every day that she
TYU1AE3rVQU,1805600,1811600,would notice him that she would fall in  love with him  and then sure enough she never did he  was so disappointed
TYU1AE3rVQU,1811600,1817840,his blueprint didn't match his life  didn't match it because she didn't even  know he existed  and he felt the suffering he could do
TYU1AE3rVQU,1817840,1823840,nothing to turn it around  well 15 years later he became a guy  named garth brooks somebody everybody
TYU1AE3rVQU,1823840,1830320,knew and he could rock  you know stadiums with his energy and  his song and his music  and he goes back to being his hike
TYU1AE3rVQU,1830320,1835360,school reunion it was his 15-year  reunion if i remember correctly i don't  remember the exact year but all i  remember is
TYU1AE3rVQU,1835360,1841360,he said he saw that woman that he was so  obsessed by i was looking forward to  seeing her  and now he was garth brooks and he met
TYU1AE3rVQU,1841360,1848080,her and after he met her and spent some  time with her he wrote a song called  thank god for unanswered prayers
TYU1AE3rVQU,1848080,1854640,sometimes not getting your blueprints  the best thing that ever happened  because the disappointment drives you to
TYU1AE3rVQU,1854640,1859679,find something more important inside of  you  or not getting it makes you look for
TYU1AE3rVQU,1859679,1867120,another aspect of your life a spiritual  aspect a family aspect  a physical aspect if you can just trust
TYU1AE3rVQU,1867120,1874000,that  life doesn't happen to you it happens  for you  then you can find in any situation a
TYU1AE3rVQU,1874000,1880880,benefit that can take your life to the  next level  i don't care if you're frank and  christian i don't care if you're
TYU1AE3rVQU,1880880,1886799,you know mandy and scott i don't care if  you're joaquin and kim  every one of us in our life is gonna
TYU1AE3rVQU,1886799,1892480,face situations where it feels like we  have total trauma  something that's been taken from us the
TYU1AE3rVQU,1892480,1898640,real question is what are you going to  do with it  some people just live in their story of  what they don't have
TYU1AE3rVQU,1898640,1904240,and they have the right to do that if  frank and kristen lived in pain  and felt bad we'd all say they have the
TYU1AE3rVQU,1904240,1910799,right to do it it's the difference  between what you have the right to do  and what you deserve to give yourself  and others we have the ability to
TYU1AE3rVQU,1910799,1917519,transcend whatever happens to us  there's something called post-traumatic  growth very few people know about it
TYU1AE3rVQU,1917519,1925039,two people go through the same stress  one's destroyed  the other grows what's the difference  the people that grow will not give up
TYU1AE3rVQU,1925039,1931679,they don't have any excuses they find a  way to break through whatever it takes  and when they do three things happen
TYU1AE3rVQU,1931679,1939360,number one they realize who they really  are and what they're capable of they  realize they're so much stronger than  they thought they were and number two
TYU1AE3rVQU,1939360,1945440,they deepen all their relationships you  want to know who really cares about you  who you love and who loves you
TYU1AE3rVQU,1945440,1951120,go through some tragedy go through some  hard times  all your facebook friends go away your
TYU1AE3rVQU,1951120,1956880,real friends your real family shows up  for you and you show up for them  and it deepens your relationships and
TYU1AE3rVQU,1956880,1962159,the third thing happens if you can push  yourself through and break through  whatever challenges life gives you is
TYU1AE3rVQU,1962159,1967519,each time you have a breakthrough you  get stronger  and it almost like builds a  psychological immunity in you
TYU1AE3rVQU,1967519,1972799,where suddenly all of a sudden it's like  stuff happens you know stuff's gonna  happen and you're not scared of it
TYU1AE3rVQU,1972799,1979039,anymore  because after you've been through a  stroke after you've been through  you know losing the use of some of your
TYU1AE3rVQU,1979039,1986559,body your senses after you lose a family  member and you break through to that you  get to the other side  it's like give me your best shot life
TYU1AE3rVQU,1986559,1992399,it's almost like there's this  psychological immunity that says i'm  ready for whatever life will give me i  don't want challenges but if they're
TYU1AE3rVQU,1992399,1998640,here i know i can handle them  that strength of spirit is what creates  a sense of freedom and joy in life
TYU1AE3rVQU,1998640,2005440,and that strength of spirit basically  comes from living a life where you are  constantly and  thing in a way to improve yourself and
TYU1AE3rVQU,2005440,2011760,to help others  that's my mission and if we can serve  you again in the future  i hope you'll check us out there's three
TYU1AE3rVQU,2011760,2017279,ways you can continue to participate  with us you can come to an event  come have an experience with us live at
TYU1AE3rVQU,2017279,2022480,a weekend at our unleash the power  within  or our date with destinies i think  you'll find it's very different than
TYU1AE3rVQU,2022480,2027919,just sitting here talking to you quietly  sitting in front of your computer screen  it's a rock and roll environment it's  like
TYU1AE3rVQU,2027919,2033600,going to the ballpark and having one  person sitting there talking  to you versus being in the ballpark of
TYU1AE3rVQU,2033600,2039200,the rock and roll concert you know with  50  000 there's an energy and a power that  comes from it second is there's
TYU1AE3rVQU,2039200,2044480,immersion  here we talk for an hour there's  distractions and emails there it's total  focus
TYU1AE3rVQU,2044480,2050320,and we go for immersion where literally  what we did here over six  weeks a few little conversations all
TYU1AE3rVQU,2050320,2058079,that happens  over and over again multiple times a day  and you get that shift so come to an  event  or call up and get a coach we have
TYU1AE3rVQU,2058079,2063520,people that you can work with and have a  free coaching session and make sure it's  really valuable for you  but these are people that can check in
TYU1AE3rVQU,2063520,2068560,with you to help make sure you break  through you make the changes you want to  make in your career or your finances or
TYU1AE3rVQU,2068560,2075118,your body or your emotions or whatever  area matters to you  and finally lastly and probably most  importantly every day you gotta feed
TYU1AE3rVQU,2075118,2081280,your mind  because every day most of us are turning  on you know some form of news it shows  up in our pocket and our blackberries
TYU1AE3rVQU,2081280,2086720,our  you know ipods or our iphones i should  say  it shows up on you know on your computer
TYU1AE3rVQU,2086720,2092878,constantly it chases us and it  rarely does a good idea interrupt you  really what you have to do is pursue the
TYU1AE3rVQU,2092878,2099359,ideas pursue the experiences that are  going to change your life  and we have a way to do it called net  time no extra time a way where you can
TYU1AE3rVQU,2099359,2105680,keep feeding your mind the stuff that  really matters with some products or  services so  if you're interested in any of those  things be sure to click on your interest
TYU1AE3rVQU,2105680,2111680,of an event or interest in having a free  coaching session  or maybe try one of our audio programs  because the other challenge here is with
TYU1AE3rVQU,2111680,2117119,video got to sit here potentially and  watch me but with audio  you can do it while you're working out  you can do it while you're cleaning the
TYU1AE3rVQU,2117119,2122160,house you can do it while you're driving  in the car  while you're getting to work we'd love  to continue serving you in any way we
TYU1AE3rVQU,2122160,2127599,can  i know i've gone long in this session  but i really want you to think about  how can i get my life the way i want it
TYU1AE3rVQU,2127599,2132880,to be the way i do it is  i figure out what my blueprint is and i  update it for what life is i
TYU1AE3rVQU,2132880,2138720,change my life match my blueprint and  suddenly  my life feels full and alive thank you
