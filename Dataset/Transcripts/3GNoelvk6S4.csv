3GNoelvk6S4,0,2159,I've added up to here with this
3GNoelvk6S4,2159,3720,with what
3GNoelvk6S4,3720,6060,with this being old enough to remember
3GNoelvk6S4,6060,8400,when OnePlus stood for well-designed
3GNoelvk6S4,8400,10500,phones with clean software at rock
3GNoelvk6S4,10500,13139,bottom prices it's been painful for me
3GNoelvk6S4,13139,14759,watching their slow descent into
3GNoelvk6S4,14759,16920,mediocrity and it's high time that I
3GNoelvk6S4,16920,19619,share my thoughts the one time Flagship
3GNoelvk6S4,19619,21300,killer has been plagued by hardware
3GNoelvk6S4,21300,24300,issues software glitches and most
3GNoelvk6S4,24300,26580,damningly lackluster support for the
3GNoelvk6S4,26580,28740,Enthusiast users who made them what they
3GNoelvk6S4,28740,32099,are today what the heck happened I used
3GNoelvk6S4,32099,34920,to rely on OnePlus as my recommendation
3GNoelvk6S4,34920,38280,go-to for friends and family alike the
3GNoelvk6S4,38280,40920,one company other than that one that I
3GNoelvk6S4,40920,43320,could count on for years of intuitive
3GNoelvk6S4,43320,44760,software updates and trouble-free
3GNoelvk6S4,44760,47820,operation then in the last couple of
3GNoelvk6S4,47820,49440,years I've ended up in the doghouse
3GNoelvk6S4,49440,52379,twice over OnePlus recommendations first
3GNoelvk6S4,52379,54719,with my son which is bad enough then
3GNoelvk6S4,54719,58500,with my wife which is much much worse so
3GNoelvk6S4,58500,60120,now to make it up to her I'm gonna have
3GNoelvk6S4,60120,61739,to buy her something nice
3GNoelvk6S4,61739,64559,with this money from our sponsor build
3GNoelvk6S4,64559,66900,redox build Redux makes it easy to
3GNoelvk6S4,66900,68760,configure your new build with support
3GNoelvk6S4,68760,70680,guides to help you along the way they
3GNoelvk6S4,70680,72600,also offer competitive pricing as
3GNoelvk6S4,72600,74640,compared to building a PC yourself so
3GNoelvk6S4,74640,77759,head to build redux.com Linus and start
3GNoelvk6S4,77759,80280,your new build today while I've been
3GNoelvk6S4,80280,82380,personally frustrated for a while it was
3GNoelvk6S4,82380,83700,in exchange with our good friend Steve
3GNoelvk6S4,83700,85560,from Gamer's Nexus that pushed me from
3GNoelvk6S4,85560,87479,I'm not recommending these to friends
3GNoelvk6S4,87479,90180,anymore to I need to make a video about
3GNoelvk6S4,90180,92880,this it appears that certain models of
3GNoelvk6S4,92880,94920,OnePlus phones have been afflicted by a
3GNoelvk6S4,94920,96960,strange bug that causes their storage to
3GNoelvk6S4,96960,99540,fill up at an alarming rate intriguing
3GNoelvk6S4,99540,101700,now the obvious solution would be to
3GNoelvk6S4,101700,103740,delete some cat pictures but if user
3GNoelvk6S4,103740,106200,reports are anything to go by not even a
3GNoelvk6S4,106200,108060,complete Purge of precious memories of
3GNoelvk6S4,108060,109860,snowball 1 is enough to free up the
3GNoelvk6S4,109860,112920,space and in fact there's no indication
3GNoelvk6S4,112920,116100,within the UI of what is consuming all
3GNoelvk6S4,116100,118619,of the storage even factory resetting
3GNoelvk6S4,118619,121680,these devices yielded no improvement so
3GNoelvk6S4,121680,123780,to diagnose what's going on here we need
3GNoelvk6S4,123780,126659,to go to the device logs logs are a
3GNoelvk6S4,126659,128640,record of diagnostic data and they can
3GNoelvk6S4,128640,130500,include information about operating
3GNoelvk6S4,130500,133140,system updates app crashes physical
3GNoelvk6S4,133140,134940,errors anything that could help to
3GNoelvk6S4,134940,136379,troubleshoot a device that isn't
3GNoelvk6S4,136379,139319,functioning correctly only we've got a
3GNoelvk6S4,139319,140099,problem
3GNoelvk6S4,140099,142680,this log data on Android isn't available
3GNoelvk6S4,142680,146340,to end users at least not out of the box
3GNoelvk6S4,146340,148800,thankfully OnePlus has still got one
3GNoelvk6S4,148800,150780,thing right they are one of the only
3GNoelvk6S4,150780,152879,Android phone makers who still allow
3GNoelvk6S4,152879,154920,adventurous users to Tinker under
3GNoelvk6S4,154920,157620,Android's Hood by rooting their device
3GNoelvk6S4,157620,160140,this process comes with enough risk that
3GNoelvk6S4,160140,162000,most manufacturers will actually void
3GNoelvk6S4,162000,164160,your warranty just for attempting it but
3GNoelvk6S4,164160,166379,it also has some benefits including
3GNoelvk6S4,166379,169019,granting complete access to the phone's
3GNoelvk6S4,169019,171120,file system and it was in these
3GNoelvk6S4,171120,173160,typically hidden system folders that a
3GNoelvk6S4,173160,175200,few Brave enthusiasts came across some
3GNoelvk6S4,175200,178500,modem log files or dumps that were
3GNoelvk6S4,178500,181080,pretty suspicious for starters they were
3GNoelvk6S4,181080,183060,big hundreds of megabytes in some cases
3GNoelvk6S4,183060,186599,which is a lot of text but your phone
3GNoelvk6S4,186599,189720,generating big log dumps isn't itself a
3GNoelvk6S4,189720,191700,problem it's when it doesn't clean up
3GNoelvk6S4,191700,194159,after itself and that's exactly what
3GNoelvk6S4,194159,196560,happened here affected users discovered
3GNoelvk6S4,196560,199739,that onepluses historically well-managed
3GNoelvk6S4,199739,203159,oxygen OS was simply leaving these logs
3GNoelvk6S4,203159,205319,to pile up until there was no storage
3GNoelvk6S4,205319,208440,left for anything else well great now
3GNoelvk6S4,208440,209879,that we know what the problem is it's an
3GNoelvk6S4,209879,213840,easy fix right not exactly while rooting
3GNoelvk6S4,213840,216900,is an option for OnePlus users it comes
3GNoelvk6S4,216900,219480,with a plethora of inconveniences first
3GNoelvk6S4,219480,221159,and foremost being that many apps
3GNoelvk6S4,221159,223260,including Banking and entertainment apps
3GNoelvk6S4,223260,225360,will simply refuse to run if they detect
3GNoelvk6S4,225360,227760,a rooted device not a great workaround
3GNoelvk6S4,227760,229799,it also doesn't change the fact that
3GNoelvk6S4,229799,231840,your system is still dumping these large
3GNoelvk6S4,231840,234420,files into storage on a consistent basis
3GNoelvk6S4,234420,236459,it's like okay there's a hole in your
3GNoelvk6S4,236459,238680,ship but don't worry this bucket will
3GNoelvk6S4,238680,239819,save the day
3GNoelvk6S4,239819,242159,dumb we tried reaching out to OnePlus
3GNoelvk6S4,242159,244200,about the problem and a couple of weeks
3GNoelvk6S4,244200,247319,later we finally got a reply indicating
3GNoelvk6S4,247319,249420,that they are aware of the issue and
3GNoelvk6S4,249420,252360,have been working to fix it which I mean
3GNoelvk6S4,252360,254819,is okay except that there are complaints
3GNoelvk6S4,254819,257820,about this going back as far as mid 2021
3GNoelvk6S4,257820,260579,with OnePlus reps at times giving users
3GNoelvk6S4,260579,262500,the run around or even ghosting them
3GNoelvk6S4,262500,264660,entirely we would never ghost our
3GNoelvk6S4,264660,266820,floatplane.com subscribers check it out
3GNoelvk6S4,266820,268979,for behind the scenes and outtakes
3GNoelvk6S4,268979,271979,now In fairness to the Reps if my recent
3GNoelvk6S4,271979,273560,experience is anything to go by
3GNoelvk6S4,273560,276060,oneplus's software team has plenty of
3GNoelvk6S4,276060,278460,other bugs to squash here's one that
3GNoelvk6S4,278460,280800,persisted on my wife's phone for months
3GNoelvk6S4,280800,283979,okay In fairness the arrow is within
3GNoelvk6S4,283979,286440,about the same area code but she's gonna
3GNoelvk6S4,286440,288600,need a bit more accuracy than this if
3GNoelvk6S4,288600,289680,she's going to end up on the right
3GNoelvk6S4,289680,291000,off-ramp hey
3GNoelvk6S4,291000,292979,my son's deal breaker issue was an even
3GNoelvk6S4,292979,295259,stupider one his phone got an update
3GNoelvk6S4,295259,297660,that completely broke data access on the
3GNoelvk6S4,297660,299940,Telus mobile network well no problem I
3GNoelvk6S4,299940,301740,thought I'll just go edit the APN
3GNoelvk6S4,301740,305400,settings and nope OnePlus actually Grays
3GNoelvk6S4,305400,307680,out these buttons making them impossible
3GNoelvk6S4,307680,310020,to click on the most ridiculous thing
3GNoelvk6S4,310020,312240,about this seemingly arbitrary interface
3GNoelvk6S4,312240,314580,decision is that the functions behind
3GNoelvk6S4,314580,317580,the grayed out buttons still work so the
3GNoelvk6S4,317580,319680,workaround for me was to use this
3GNoelvk6S4,319680,322919,third-party shortcut manager app to jump
3GNoelvk6S4,322919,325740,to those settings directly bypassing the
3GNoelvk6S4,325740,328259,grayed out button hey voila the settings
3GNoelvk6S4,328259,330900,can be changed I mean
3GNoelvk6S4,330900,333120,Apple gives access to APN settings
3GNoelvk6S4,333120,336720,OnePlus it is basic functionality like
3GNoelvk6S4,336720,338340,the van hoodies super secure phone
3GNoelvk6S4,338340,341639,pocket get yours today at lttstore.com
3GNoelvk6S4,341639,343560,I can't recommend putting one of these
3GNoelvk6S4,343560,345479,in it though since Linus gave me this
3GNoelvk6S4,345479,347280,phone a year ago I've had my camera app
3GNoelvk6S4,347280,349800,refuse to open until I restart but then
3GNoelvk6S4,349800,351419,it breaks again the minute my kids do
3GNoelvk6S4,351419,353699,something cute I've also had problems
3GNoelvk6S4,353699,355740,with picture messages for three months
3GNoelvk6S4,355740,357960,before they finally patch that and
3GNoelvk6S4,357960,359759,probably the weirdest one was that I
3GNoelvk6S4,359759,361259,couldn't answer phone calls it's
3GNoelvk6S4,361259,362759,intermittent so I couldn't catch it on
3GNoelvk6S4,362759,365039,camera but the green button to answer
3GNoelvk6S4,365039,367620,calls just wouldn't register which is
3GNoelvk6S4,367620,369840,pretty important for you know a phone
3GNoelvk6S4,369840,372900,they are losing me too I can't say I've
3GNoelvk6S4,372900,375060,ever had my actual phone app not work
3GNoelvk6S4,375060,377759,but I've got my own problems the most
3GNoelvk6S4,377759,380100,maddening one is the app switcher look
3GNoelvk6S4,380100,382139,at this if I go to click on the previous
3GNoelvk6S4,382139,385440,opened app it reopens the app I was just
3GNoelvk6S4,385440,387180,using instead of opening the app I
3GNoelvk6S4,387180,389520,clicked on I used the switcher dozens of
3GNoelvk6S4,389520,390900,times a day so if you're starting to
3GNoelvk6S4,390900,394139,notice gray hairs that could be it Miami
3GNoelvk6S4,394139,396900,and light sensor can take ages to adjust
3GNoelvk6S4,396900,398880,in dark areas and I've had camera
3GNoelvk6S4,398880,401639,problems too after the Android 11 update
3GNoelvk6S4,401639,403139,I noticed that the images were being
3GNoelvk6S4,403139,404819,over processed to the point where
3GNoelvk6S4,404819,407100,pictures of my son looked like he had
3GNoelvk6S4,407100,409440,the life sucked out of him
3GNoelvk6S4,409440,411419,and I also noticed some odd fingerprint
3GNoelvk6S4,411419,412800,scanner Behavior where it sometimes
3GNoelvk6S4,412800,415199,won't even pop up of course every phone
3GNoelvk6S4,415199,418380,has bugs some of them lots so why are we
3GNoelvk6S4,418380,419819,picking on OnePlus
3GNoelvk6S4,419819,421440,it's because they promise to be
3GNoelvk6S4,421440,423180,something different and their Fall From
3GNoelvk6S4,423180,425060,Grace has left a hole both in the market
3GNoelvk6S4,425060,427860,and in our hearts
3GNoelvk6S4,427860,430020,okay as cheesy as that is we're not the
3GNoelvk6S4,430020,432360,only ones who have noticed in early 2021
3GNoelvk6S4,432360,435060,MKBHD uploaded a video titled what
3GNoelvk6S4,435060,437460,happened to OnePlus his ultimate
3GNoelvk6S4,437460,439560,conclusion was that they didn't really
3GNoelvk6S4,439560,442020,change but rather they outgrew their
3GNoelvk6S4,442020,444720,initial role as the enthusiast-focused
3GNoelvk6S4,444720,446580,Flagship killer sub brand for parent
3GNoelvk6S4,446580,449699,company BBK he lamented their price
3GNoelvk6S4,449699,451919,creep and the design compromises that
3GNoelvk6S4,451919,453660,they've made to appeal to the mainstream
3GNoelvk6S4,453660,456180,but he understood that business units
3GNoelvk6S4,456180,458460,have to be profitable and expressed a
3GNoelvk6S4,458460,460199,careful optimism about a potential
3GNoelvk6S4,460199,461580,return to form
3GNoelvk6S4,461580,463860,and he could still be right all the
3GNoelvk6S4,463860,465660,right ingredients are still there and
3GNoelvk6S4,465660,468060,many of their big announcements since
3GNoelvk6S4,468060,470160,then around pooling resources between
3GNoelvk6S4,470160,472620,OnePlus and Oppo have been
3GNoelvk6S4,472620,476039,yeah and moments for people like me who
3GNoelvk6S4,476039,477900,knew that co-founder Pete lau's previous
3GNoelvk6S4,477900,481340,role was as a VP at Oppo and also that
3GNoelvk6S4,481340,484919,they never really left Oppo and OnePlus
3GNoelvk6S4,484919,488520,are both subsidiaries of BBK
3GNoelvk6S4,488520,490319,so with all the pieces still in place
3GNoelvk6S4,490319,492840,and nothing really changed why are they
3GNoelvk6S4,492840,493800,struggling
3GNoelvk6S4,493800,496199,my diagnosis is that it's a matter of
3GNoelvk6S4,496199,499080,focus Oppo and OnePlus Foams have run
3GNoelvk6S4,499080,502080,similar Hardware since day Zero I mean
3GNoelvk6S4,502080,504180,bbk's different brands are literally
3GNoelvk6S4,504180,506099,only separated by curtains on the
3GNoelvk6S4,506099,508860,production floor so it was always the
3GNoelvk6S4,508860,511139,software that set one plus apart it was
3GNoelvk6S4,511139,513180,that obsessive attention to system
3GNoelvk6S4,513180,515279,responsiveness into meaningful
3GNoelvk6S4,515279,517620,modifications to an otherwise mostly
3GNoelvk6S4,517620,520260,stock Android experience
3GNoelvk6S4,520260,522779,so why has that changed
3GNoelvk6S4,522779,525480,well there was a leadership shakeup and
3GNoelvk6S4,525480,527640,while neither has addressed the alleged
3GNoelvk6S4,527640,529680,conflict that caused fellow co-founder
3GNoelvk6S4,529680,531959,Carl pay to leave he ended up founding
3GNoelvk6S4,531959,534480,his own company nothing it was pretty
3GNoelvk6S4,534480,536399,clear during the awkward transition
3GNoelvk6S4,536399,539399,period where Mr Lyle gradually took on a
3GNoelvk6S4,539399,542580,more public-facing role that the rift
3GNoelvk6S4,542580,544740,between them was a long time Brewing
3GNoelvk6S4,544740,547019,if I had to guess what happened I would
3GNoelvk6S4,547019,549000,say it was probably over controversial
3GNoelvk6S4,549000,552060,ideas like merging oppos from my
3GNoelvk6S4,552060,554459,personal experience worse color OS
3GNoelvk6S4,554459,557339,software with onepluses really excellent
3GNoelvk6S4,557339,560580,oxygen OS but as an outsider it's hard
3GNoelvk6S4,560580,563640,to say for sure after all it is Pete Lau
3GNoelvk6S4,563640,565500,not Carl pay Who is credited with
3GNoelvk6S4,565500,568320,bringing CyanogenMod the clean mostly
3GNoelvk6S4,568320,570120,stock open source Android skin that
3GNoelvk6S4,570120,572880,eventually became lineage OS to Oppo in
3GNoelvk6S4,572880,574680,the first place
3GNoelvk6S4,574680,577620,bottom line like Marquez I'm still
3GNoelvk6S4,577620,580080,rooting for them and there is tons of
3GNoelvk6S4,580080,582420,time left to right the ship but it's
3GNoelvk6S4,582420,584100,clear that they need to get their head
3GNoelvk6S4,584100,587220,in the game especially when it comes to
3GNoelvk6S4,587220,588420,Software
3GNoelvk6S4,588420,590220,and it's clear that I'm going to tell
3GNoelvk6S4,590220,592740,you about our sponsor Lakeside software
