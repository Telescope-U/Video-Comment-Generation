b_v4gK_19sA,125920,131680,with serving at a level so high so big  so massive that people feel like they
b_v4gK_19sA,131680,139200,have to change their lives because they  crossed your path  and you have to be willing to use every
b_v4gK_19sA,139200,146959,experience that's ever happened in your  life not as a fortress holding you from  using your voice but as the fuel on why
b_v4gK_19sA,146959,150239,you will use your voice
b_v4gK_19sA,152160,159040,you got to be willing to not stand in  your story but stand on your story
b_v4gK_19sA,161280,166319,the only belief that you need to have  that thing
b_v4gK_19sA,166319,171360,that is going to allow you to take that  first step burn the following statement
b_v4gK_19sA,171360,180360,into your soul  humans  are  the ultimate adaptation machine
b_v4gK_19sA,191540,196840,[Music]  ask yourself this
b_v4gK_19sA,196840,200959,question what i am doing
b_v4gK_19sA,201920,208720,what i am about to do  is it going to help me get where i am  going is this action going to make me
b_v4gK_19sA,208720,212440,stronger or weaker
b_v4gK_19sA,217120,223360,your brain  is the only thing you have when you're  going through depression
b_v4gK_19sA,223360,230400,when you're going through hard times  you're going through death real life  you're alone
b_v4gK_19sA,230400,235599,but there's 24 hours in the day where  you're alone in this brain and your
b_v4gK_19sA,235599,241439,brain is talking to you in all kinds of  ways and it wants to control you and  pull you in these different pockets
b_v4gK_19sA,241439,250720,if you can't control your own brain and  your brain controls you  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,250720,257600,see when you begin to understand and  acknowledge your fear  and you go forth anyhow
b_v4gK_19sA,257600,263919,you go forth in a spirit  and a knowing  that there's a way
b_v4gK_19sA,263919,269759,that you can begin to handle this  there's a way  out here somewhere there's a solution
b_v4gK_19sA,269759,274800,what it is that you're seeking  that you have the capacity to whatever
b_v4gK_19sA,274800,280400,comes up  to handle it to face it  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,280400,284240,and rather than feeling powerless
b_v4gK_19sA,285840,290000,you begin to feel powerful
b_v4gK_19sA,294560,300400,always something you can do differently  and once you understand that you can
b_v4gK_19sA,300400,306160,always make a different choice and get a  different reaction and that's the power  in your life that's the power that you
b_v4gK_19sA,306160,312000,have  [Music]  that's why people never achieve their
b_v4gK_19sA,312000,317600,strategic goals they lose the little  tactical battles the death of a thousand
b_v4gK_19sA,317600,322720,cuts  all adds up why because we don't think
b_v4gK_19sA,322720,329600,about the big picture  one degree at a time
b_v4gK_19sA,329600,335199,one degree closer to death one degree  closer to failure
b_v4gK_19sA,335199,339840,you have a why you can survive almost  anyhow
b_v4gK_19sA,361520,366880,that living your dream  changing your behaviors overcoming
b_v4gK_19sA,366880,374160,negative habits it's challenging  it's hard  that living alone is just very difficult
b_v4gK_19sA,374160,382479,and once we begin to come to grips with  the fact that living is difficult  life is very challenging
b_v4gK_19sA,383520,389520,you are the star of your show you are  the director you're writing the script  and you will determine whether your life
b_v4gK_19sA,389520,395638,is a smash  office hit or flop
b_v4gK_19sA,400690,403940,[Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,405980,412960,[Music]  discipline is rooted in the truth we
b_v4gK_19sA,412960,420680,tell ourselves and discipline delivers  long-term strategic success
b_v4gK_19sA,420880,427199,[Music]  single most important thing in your life  is your dream
b_v4gK_19sA,427199,432479,it's your dream  it's what you dream about
b_v4gK_19sA,433039,438319,if you see it you can achieve it  you if you don't have visions
b_v4gK_19sA,438319,443360,you can't make it in this world  you need
b_v4gK_19sA,443360,451199,something  to  sustain yourself through that  it's not optional because the
b_v4gK_19sA,451199,456240,the price of existence is so high that  without that sustaining meaning
b_v4gK_19sA,456240,462400,it it corrupts you it embitters you and  and once you're embittered things go
b_v4gK_19sA,462400,469520,downhill rapidly you get vengeful and  and you get angry and and you get  destructive and then there's really no
b_v4gK_19sA,469520,475360,limit to that and i've been suggesting  to people that  the sustaining meaning that they can
b_v4gK_19sA,475360,481919,find in their life isn't to be found  through happiness let's say because  happiness doesn't work when you're not
b_v4gK_19sA,481919,487360,happy when when when things have gone  badly for you for for even for
b_v4gK_19sA,487360,494639,accidental reasons but  you can find sustaining meaning and  responsibility
b_v4gK_19sA,495680,502960,because god sent you here and no human  being came to this planet empty
b_v4gK_19sA,504000,510800,no matter what you've done if it didn't  kill you  there's more left
b_v4gK_19sA,513279,518560,turn your wounds  into wisdom  you will be wounded many times in your
b_v4gK_19sA,518560,526000,life you'll make mistakes some people  will call them failures but i have  learned that failure is really god's way
b_v4gK_19sA,526000,531040,of saying excuse me you're moving in the  wrong direction
b_v4gK_19sA,531040,537680,a fixed mindset is when you believe your  talent and intelligence are fixed traits  a growth mindset is when you believe
b_v4gK_19sA,537680,543120,your talent and intelligence are  malleable traits that you can actually  change them you can improve them you can
b_v4gK_19sA,543120,549440,get better over time smarter over time  more competent over time and to do that  you just need to reframe the failure as
b_v4gK_19sA,549440,555040,a learning experience so that's one of  the big ones people that can really fail
b_v4gK_19sA,555040,561600,without losing their enthusiasm  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,561600,567519,you've got to stop asking how little you  can get away with and start asking one  of the most powerful questions in the
b_v4gK_19sA,567519,572880,universe which is how much can you bear
b_v4gK_19sA,574000,579600,you came here loaded and you came here  to make a deposit and deposit you will
b_v4gK_19sA,579600,586800,make and if you don't make you are a  generational thief because you stole  from the next generation
b_v4gK_19sA,586800,593440,the next generation supposed to benefit  from what you came to deliver and if you  settle down on what you've done and not
b_v4gK_19sA,593440,599920,do what you could do then you robbed  them of what you came to leave for them  to enjoy
b_v4gK_19sA,600240,606560,and that is why you should never allow  what you've done to stop you from doing  what you could do
b_v4gK_19sA,606560,613279,take responsibility for yourself and  that works and then if you do that  properly you can take responsibility for
b_v4gK_19sA,613279,620320,your family and then if you do that  properly you can take responsibility for  your community and you can continue to
b_v4gK_19sA,620320,626000,burden yourself voluntarily let's say  with with a greater and greater range of
b_v4gK_19sA,626000,631040,existential challenges and all that that  does is make
b_v4gK_19sA,631040,635600,more and more  and more of you
b_v4gK_19sA,639600,644800,and  that  works as an antidote to the catastrophe
b_v4gK_19sA,644800,651940,of life  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,654800,662880,create the highest  grandest vision  possible for your life because
b_v4gK_19sA,662880,670480,you become what you believe  when you wake up in the morning
b_v4gK_19sA,670480,676399,and  your life means something to somebody  other than you that you have a purpose
b_v4gK_19sA,676399,682560,if you don't  go do the things that you're going to do  people's lives will suffer
b_v4gK_19sA,682560,688000,and i think that that kind of purpose  that like to live in service not to you
b_v4gK_19sA,688000,693279,but to live in service to humanity to  live in service to your family to live
b_v4gK_19sA,693279,700640,in service to your church to your city  to your country to the world living in  service is that i
b_v4gK_19sA,700640,706240,feel like that is the purest form of joy
b_v4gK_19sA,706720,713200,[Music]  woe is me it's not my fault it was so  and so they did it to me i want you to
b_v4gK_19sA,713200,718959,stop that immediately remind yourself  that you own your life remind yourself  of cause and effect remind yourself that
b_v4gK_19sA,718959,724800,you are in control you could make a  different decision and you could get a  different outcome because you can't
b_v4gK_19sA,724800,731120,control the world you can't control  other people you can only control  yourself between that stimulus and that
b_v4gK_19sA,731120,735839,response is your ability to make a  different choice
b_v4gK_19sA,741530,748399,[Music]  if you can be still long enough  in in all of your endeavors the good
b_v4gK_19sA,748399,755279,times the hard times to connect yourself  to the source  i call it god you can call it whatever
b_v4gK_19sA,755279,761040,you want to the force nature allah the  power  if you can connect yourself to the
b_v4gK_19sA,761040,766399,source and allow the energy that is your  personality your life force to be
b_v4gK_19sA,766399,773279,connected to the greater force  anything is possible for you
b_v4gK_19sA,773279,780720,i'm talking about being honest  with yourself about what you're doing  about how you've performed about whether
b_v4gK_19sA,780720,788160,or not you're being weak in something  because if you're being weak  the only problem with that is ignoring
b_v4gK_19sA,788160,794000,it is pretending like it's okay is not  holding yourself to a standard it's  going to happen from time to time but if
b_v4gK_19sA,794000,799120,you're not honest with yourself about  where you are if you're not having that  hard direct talk then you're never going
b_v4gK_19sA,799120,805120,to make progress  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,805120,810160,you got to make a decision  listen to me you got to make a decision
b_v4gK_19sA,810160,816160,what's the decision  what's the thing you came here for now  we're at the moment the clock is ticking
b_v4gK_19sA,816160,821360,people say all the time hey life is  short  let me tell you something
b_v4gK_19sA,821360,827519,life can be long  you bury your dreams you quit this  life gets long
b_v4gK_19sA,827519,833519,see time's relative  two minutes of you being with your  sweetie doing whatever you like to do  with them that can go by quick right
b_v4gK_19sA,833519,840079,what about the last two minutes on a  treadmill does that not seem like it  goes by for like four hours right so if  you're enjoying it it's short if it's
b_v4gK_19sA,840079,846639,painful it's long life can be long  when you lose your job
b_v4gK_19sA,846639,852880,when someone you thought you'd be with  for the rest of your life say no we  can't do this no more
b_v4gK_19sA,852880,862320,that's when you have to  stand  that's when you have to begin to live
b_v4gK_19sA,862320,869199,this faith and that's not on you that's  when you got to call on something how do  you let that mind be in you you got to
b_v4gK_19sA,869199,875199,be out of your mind to believe in spite  of these numbers you can still make it  in spite of the pain you're feeling you
b_v4gK_19sA,875199,880360,can still come back again i believe it
b_v4gK_19sA,894720,899839,my life is not everything i wanted to be  and perhaps it's not everything that i
b_v4gK_19sA,899839,904959,need it to be  and
b_v4gK_19sA,904959,911519,you ask yourself you sit on the bed and  say okay man i'm ready to  learn something like what
b_v4gK_19sA,911519,916560,what's one thing i'm doing wrong  that i know i'm doing wrong
b_v4gK_19sA,916560,921760,that i could fix  that i would fix  it's like
b_v4gK_19sA,921760,927360,you meditate on that you'll get an  answer  and it won't be one you want but it'll
b_v4gK_19sA,927360,930720,be the necessary one
b_v4gK_19sA,932800,938720,every single  thought we have or every sentence we  speak is an affirmation
b_v4gK_19sA,938720,944320,and it's either positive or negative and  it's going out from us and it's creating  our experiences
b_v4gK_19sA,944320,950240,however when we talk about doing  affirmations what we're talking about  is
b_v4gK_19sA,950240,956880,making  definite positive statements to create  something in our life or to remove
b_v4gK_19sA,956880,962160,something in our life  i call don't die with your music still
b_v4gK_19sA,962160,967600,in you  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,967600,973440,all of you have some music playing  and all of you have a heroic mission
b_v4gK_19sA,973440,979680,there's no accidents in this universe  we all show up here  with a purpose
b_v4gK_19sA,979680,985519,there's an intelligence that is a part  of everything and everyone and all of us  are connected to it
b_v4gK_19sA,985519,991040,and  too many of us  are afraid
b_v4gK_19sA,991040,1006100,to listen to that music  and march to it  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,1006720,1012320,there is no more effective way of  operating in the world than to  conceptualize the highest good that you
b_v4gK_19sA,1012320,1019440,can and then strive to attain it there's  no  more practical pathway
b_v4gK_19sA,1019440,1027038,to the kind of success that you could  have if you actually knew what success  was the world shifts itself
b_v4gK_19sA,1027038,1032079,around your aim  because you're you're a creature that  has a name you have to have a name in
b_v4gK_19sA,1032079,1038400,order to do something you're an aiming  creature you look at a point and you  move towards it it's built right into
b_v4gK_19sA,1038400,1045199,you  and so you have a name well let's say  your aim is the highest possible aim  well then so that sets up the world
b_v4gK_19sA,1045199,1050480,around you  it organizes all of your perceptions it  organizes what you see and you don't see
b_v4gK_19sA,1050480,1054720,it organizes your emotions and your  motivations
b_v4gK_19sA,1056640,1064159,after all you've been through  in this day alone
b_v4gK_19sA,1065200,1070320,and the many days and years passed  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,1070320,1078880,how you got here to this  the choices you've made  that have brought you to this day
b_v4gK_19sA,1078880,1087039,open your heart  and quietly to yourself
b_v4gK_19sA,1087360,1093280,say the only prayer  that's ever needed

b_v4gK_19sA,1101200,1106799,and you get another chance  this day
b_v4gK_19sA,1107280,1113760,to do better and be better  another chance to become more

b_v4gK_19sA,1120559,1126080,and what you were created to fulfill  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,1126080,1131200,maybe you want to go  into a relationship with someone but  you've been afraid to but your heart
b_v4gK_19sA,1131200,1138320,says it's the right thing to do  whoever you are whatever that music is  however distant it may sound however
b_v4gK_19sA,1138320,1145039,strange however weird others may  interpret it to be  don't get to the end of your life
b_v4gK_19sA,1145039,1151039,and know that you're going to leave  and not have it played yet
b_v4gK_19sA,1151039,1155710,don't die with your music still  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,1156160,1161520,your time is limited so don't waste it  living someone else's life
b_v4gK_19sA,1161520,1166640,don't be trapped by dogma which is  living with the results of other  people's thinking
b_v4gK_19sA,1166640,1172080,don't let the noise of others opinions  drown out your own inner voice
b_v4gK_19sA,1172660,1177760,[Music]  don't underestimate the whole your
b_v4gK_19sA,1177760,1183520,absence would leave  each of us we're remarkable creatures
b_v4gK_19sA,1183520,1190160,and we have something to  offer to  the world  to our people we love to the world at
b_v4gK_19sA,1190160,1196400,large  it's our responsibility to make that  manifest and  we move a little farther away from
b_v4gK_19sA,1196400,1200080,paradise every time that doesn't happen
b_v4gK_19sA,1202480,1208240,and most important have the courage to  follow your heart and intuition

b_v4gK_19sA,1555200,1561039,set out to do there should be one litmus  test  you should be able to ask and  affirmatively answer the following
b_v4gK_19sA,1561039,1567278,question  do i want to know more about this than  anyone else in the world
b_v4gK_19sA,1568320,1573919,don't get into something unless you plan  to be the best that's my piece of advice
b_v4gK_19sA,1574400,1580880,but if you want to have the passion to  make something big  to make big change it's got to be
b_v4gK_19sA,1580880,1586640,something that you believe in beyond  reasonable doubt it's got to be  something you've just got to make happen
b_v4gK_19sA,1586640,1591919,so ask yourself do i want to know more  about this than anyone else because  you're going to have to get better at it

b_v4gK_19sA,1630080,1636559,fortitude and will  it won't accept weakness it won't
b_v4gK_19sA,1636559,1641158,tolerate another breakdown

b_v4gK_19sA,1681120,1686320,i'm saying this is a time more than ever  that you want to begin to inoculate
b_v4gK_19sA,1686320,1692000,yourself with positive words coming to  conventions showing up in meetings being
b_v4gK_19sA,1692000,1697600,on the calls to make yourself  unstoppable to get out of your mind the
b_v4gK_19sA,1697600,1705120,polluting negative thoughts that's  causing most people to go through life  being stuck because of volunteer victims
b_v4gK_19sA,1705120,1712080,somebody said that many people die at  age 25 and don't get buried until  they're 65 because they've got so much
b_v4gK_19sA,1712080,1721200,garbage in their minds you are here  because you've got a clear vision of  what you want and where you're going
b_v4gK_19sA,1722240,1727679,the only way to build your ego that is  truly anti-fragile that i have found is
b_v4gK_19sA,1727679,1734480,to be the learner  to be willing to admit when you're wrong  to look at your goal and work backwards
b_v4gK_19sA,1734480,1739600,and say is what i'm doing actually  moving me towards my goal or not not  does it make me feel good about myself
b_v4gK_19sA,1739600,1746159,not am i right not am i smart is it  moving me towards my goal and if it is  then you do it and if it doesn't then
b_v4gK_19sA,1746159,1751720,you don't  where do you start
b_v4gK_19sA,1752399,1758679,you start right here  and when do you start you start right  now
b_v4gK_19sA,1766480,1773200,because you might ask yourself like if  for 10 years if you didn't avoid doing  what you knew you needed to do by the
b_v4gK_19sA,1773200,1781840,depth by your own definitions right  within the value structure that you've  created to the degree that you've done  that what would you be like
b_v4gK_19sA,1785679,1792960,hard thing to accept but in our lives we  are getting out of our life right now  exactly what we believe we're worthy of
b_v4gK_19sA,1792960,1799600,exactly what we think we deserve our  life is a direct reflection of our  identity which is the thoughts concepts
b_v4gK_19sA,1799600,1804640,beliefs values and worth we hold true to  be about ourselves
b_v4gK_19sA,1805440,1812880,we're getting out of life right now what  we believe we're worth  and we believe we're worth it because of  these patterns and our identity and our
b_v4gK_19sA,1812880,1819520,lack of choosing to have what we want  not just the material things not just  the body weight not just the amount of
b_v4gK_19sA,1819520,1825290,money not just having the relationship  but choosing the emotion we want
b_v4gK_19sA,1825290,1831360,[Music]  well you know there are remarkable  people who come into the world from time
b_v4gK_19sA,1831360,1836720,to time and there are people who do find  out over  decades-long periods what they could be
b_v4gK_19sA,1836720,1843520,like if they were who they were if they  said  if they spoke their being forward
b_v4gK_19sA,1843520,1851399,and they'd get stronger and stronger and  stronger and we don't know the limits to  that we do not know the limits to that
b_v4gK_19sA,1852159,1859919,and you know i find that so many of us  think that our dreams are unreachable or  unrealistic and it's just so sad i mean
b_v4gK_19sA,1859919,1867600,people think that their dreams disappear  and if that's what you think  congratulations you're officially stuck
b_v4gK_19sA,1867600,1873039,and the truth is that our dreams are  always there and they don't ever give up  on us
b_v4gK_19sA,1873039,1876759,we give up on them
b_v4gK_19sA,1880159,1887440,what i learned along the way  everything that's happening to you is  god is processing
b_v4gK_19sA,1887440,1893600,every difficult moment you're having  he just  processes it  that's all he doing
b_v4gK_19sA,1893600,1900240,everything you're going through is  preparing you for what you ask god for  and if you need to be tough when you get
b_v4gK_19sA,1900240,1906480,to where you're going  then he going to toughen you  [Music]  if you got to be more caring along the
b_v4gK_19sA,1906480,1912799,way he gonna let you have some trials  come your way that's gonna have to  produce that in you
b_v4gK_19sA,1913900,1919200,[Music]  and so if your life isn't everything it  could be you could ask yourself well
b_v4gK_19sA,1919200,1924399,what would happen if you just stopped  wasting the opportunities that are in  front of you
b_v4gK_19sA,1924399,1929440,you'd be who knows how much more  efficient 10 times more efficient 20
b_v4gK_19sA,1929440,1934799,times more efficient  you have no idea how efficient efficient
b_v4gK_19sA,1934799,1940000,people get it's completely it's off the  charts
b_v4gK_19sA,1941039,1946320,see there's a book being written about  your life  isn't there
b_v4gK_19sA,1946320,1952799,someone somewhere has taken inventory of  your life don't compare your chapter 1  to someone's chapter 10.
b_v4gK_19sA,1952799,1958960,you write your own book and at any  moment in your life you can decide that  you want to make this the new chapter
b_v4gK_19sA,1958960,1965440,you're tr literally in your life you can  turn the page  and those previous chapters are your old
b_v4gK_19sA,1965440,1971519,book it's like old testament new  testament  old story news story they're connected
b_v4gK_19sA,1971519,1978159,they're related but you can flip the  page and you can have a whole new story  if you decide right now i am literally
b_v4gK_19sA,1978159,1983600,turning my breakthrough is i turn the  page and in this second i start to write
b_v4gK_19sA,1983600,1990559,the best chapters of my life  [Music]
b_v4gK_19sA,1990559,1995760,that's the life to live that's the life  like to say i care about this it matters
b_v4gK_19sA,1995760,2003120,it gives me purpose i'm going to fight  for this this is a group of people i  want to serve  and i'm going to go all the way out
b_v4gK_19sA,2003120,2008880,every day and look you're not going to  hit it every day there's going to be  days where you're off there's going to  be days where you're weak
b_v4gK_19sA,2008880,2015600,weak  but if that day instead of bullshitting  yourself instead of saying i wasn't weak  today what are you talking about if that
b_v4gK_19sA,2015600,2021360,day you own it and you say yeah it was  week today and i'm not going to be weak  tomorrow but i'm not afraid to face that
b_v4gK_19sA,2021360,2026720,i'm not afraid to accept that i'm not  perfect i'm not afraid to look in the  mirror and say today was a bad day that
b_v4gK_19sA,2026720,2033360,i didn't make myself proud today  they know they should adopt it isn't
b_v4gK_19sA,2033360,2039519,merely that your fate depends on whether  or not you get your act together and to  what degree you decide that you're going
b_v4gK_19sA,2039519,2044799,to live out your own genuine being it  isn't only your fate it's the fate of
b_v4gK_19sA,2044799,2051358,everyone that you're networked with  but that shouldn't diminish who you are
b_v4gK_19sA,2051358,2057440,it shouldn't diminish your view of  yourself why because i wouldn't serve  you
b_v4gK_19sA,2057440,2064320,because if you beat yourself up today  you make it harder for you to be rad  tomorrow
b_v4gK_19sA,2065839,2072919,it's a game that has to be seen in total  it's not a game where you can take a  snapshot
b_v4gK_19sA,2077200,2083118,and so that's how you're connected and  the things you do they're like dropping  a stone in a pond the ripples move
b_v4gK_19sA,2083118,2088800,outward and they affect things in ways  that you can't fully comprehend  comprehended it means that the things
b_v4gK_19sA,2088800,2095320,that you do and that you don't do are  far more important than you think
b_v4gK_19sA,2102800,2108800,but i mean if you really asked yourself  wouldn't you be so sure if you had the  choice i can live with no responsibility
b_v4gK_19sA,2108800,2114480,whatsoever the price i pay is that  nothing matters  or i can reverse it and everything
b_v4gK_19sA,2114480,2119599,matters  but i have to take the responsibility  that's associated with that it's not so
b_v4gK_19sA,2119599,2124160,obvious to me that people would take the  meaningful path
b_v4gK_19sA,2129440,2135680,when you have doubt when your faith  becomes weak your reasons will fortify  your faith
b_v4gK_19sA,2135680,2141680,when you have an inner conversation say  no don't do that  your reasons will become your rod and
b_v4gK_19sA,2141680,2147200,your staff to comfort you to take you  through those challenging moments
b_v4gK_19sA,2147200,2153520,so write down your reasons  and what you will find  that when you decide to act
b_v4gK_19sA,2153520,2160800,when you decide to take life on  and let me warn you  it can be painful it will be
b_v4gK_19sA,2160800,2166720,uncomfortable and that's where the  growth is  when you're uncomfortable when you're
b_v4gK_19sA,2166720,2172960,stretching out  when you're taking life by the collar  you're gonna get thrown to the ground
b_v4gK_19sA,2172960,2179280,again and again and again but when you  have determination  and you know that what you're doing is
b_v4gK_19sA,2179280,2186000,right it gives you your life it gives a  special meaning and power to you  you will have some power from on heart
b_v4gK_19sA,2186000,2192880,you will discover some things about  yourself that will begin to electrify  your personality
b_v4gK_19sA,2195700,2201200,[Music]  like there's no excuse
b_v4gK_19sA,2201200,2206560,whatsoever  for not getting at what it is that you
b_v4gK_19sA,2206560,2211550,should be doing  [Music]
