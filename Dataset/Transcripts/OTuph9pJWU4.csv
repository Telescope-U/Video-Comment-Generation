OTuph9pJWU4,8639,13679,happy halloween my friends  [Laughter]
OTuph9pJWU4,13679,17920,i know it's not halloween today
OTuph9pJWU4,18960,25840,but can you guess what i'm going to talk  about  yes that's right
OTuph9pJWU4,25840,33120,bones  zoom in  hey don't be scared that's not a ghost
OTuph9pJWU4,33120,38239,that's just how your skeletal system  looks like come let's talk a little more
OTuph9pJWU4,38239,44879,about the bones in your body  [Music]  let's start with the head
OTuph9pJWU4,44879,52239,cranium  this is the cranium  it protects the brain from bumps
OTuph9pJWU4,52239,59600,and knocks  [Music]  mandible  the lower part of the skull is called
OTuph9pJWU4,59600,66479,the mandible  it is the largest and the strongest bone  of your face
OTuph9pJWU4,66479,73840,scapula  it is a triangular shaped bone that is  protected by surrounding muscles
OTuph9pJWU4,73840,79840,it is commonly called the shoulder blade  ribcage
OTuph9pJWU4,79840,86720,the rib cage protects your heart and  lungs  it is actually very delicate and can be
OTuph9pJWU4,86720,93759,damaged by accidents sports or even a  powerful sneeze
OTuph9pJWU4,94260,100799,[Music]  the arm consists of three large bones
OTuph9pJWU4,100799,106720,the humerus bone forms the upper arm  the radius and the ulna are the two
OTuph9pJWU4,106720,112479,bones which form the lower arm  you have one radius and one ulna in each
OTuph9pJWU4,112479,118890,arm the radius and ulna bones connect  between the elbow joint and the wrist
OTuph9pJWU4,118890,126960,[Music]  your palm consists of three groups of  bones carpals metacarpals and
OTuph9pJWU4,126960,132800,phallingers  fema the femur or thigh bone is the
OTuph9pJWU4,132800,138959,longest heaviest and strongest bone in  the entire human body
OTuph9pJWU4,138959,144879,all of the body's weight is supported by  the femurs during many activities such
OTuph9pJWU4,144879,151599,as running  jumping  walking
OTuph9pJWU4,151599,158160,and standing  patella the patella is also known as the
OTuph9pJWU4,158160,165120,kneecap  it is a thick circular triangular bone  which covers and protects the surface of
OTuph9pJWU4,165120,170879,the knee joint  fibula the fibula is the outer and
OTuph9pJWU4,170879,178720,thinner bone of the lower leg  its main function is to provide  attachment for muscles however it
OTuph9pJWU4,178720,186720,doesn't give much support and strength  to the leg  tibia the tibia is a large bone located
OTuph9pJWU4,186720,192640,in the lower leg of the human body it is  also known as the shin bone and is the
OTuph9pJWU4,192640,198720,strongest weight bearing bone  [Music]  just like your palm your foot also
OTuph9pJWU4,198720,205680,consists of two groups of bones tassels  and metatarsals
OTuph9pJWU4,205680,211360,trim your time  did you know that half of your body's
OTuph9pJWU4,211360,216640,bones are in hands and feet  [Music]
OTuph9pJWU4,216640,223239,and  an infant has 300 bones  whereas an adult has
OTuph9pJWU4,223239,228319,206 bones  this is because some smaller bones fuse
OTuph9pJWU4,228319,237040,together to form bigger bones  [Music]  okay kids got to go now
OTuph9pJWU4,237120,241280,hey  hello friends
OTuph9pJWU4,244239,249519,oh no  i guess that's a tsunami
OTuph9pJWU4,249519,254720,come let me tell you all about it  zoom in
OTuph9pJWU4,254720,260170,tsunamis are caused by sudden movements  of the ocean flow due to earthquakes
OTuph9pJWU4,260170,268160,[Music]  landslides on the seafloor  land slumping into the ocean
OTuph9pJWU4,268160,275120,large volcanic eruptions or  a meteorite crash on the ocean floor
OTuph9pJWU4,275120,282800,when an earthquake  a landslide  or a volcanic eruption occurs on the sea
OTuph9pJWU4,282800,290720,or ocean bed  a vertical jolt is created which  displaces the bed and causes extreme
OTuph9pJWU4,290720,296560,tension in water  the water is pushed upwards but gravity
OTuph9pJWU4,296560,301680,tries to pull it down  this causes an upsurge in the water
OTuph9pJWU4,301680,307600,levels and the waves start moving away  from the point of tension
OTuph9pJWU4,307600,313919,tsunamis are barely felt as a ripple on  the ocean surface as the water is quite
OTuph9pJWU4,313919,321600,deep but  as and when those waves reach the land  the water becomes shallower and the
OTuph9pJWU4,321600,329840,waves constantly increase in height  they hit the show and oh my cause a lot
OTuph9pJWU4,329840,334880,of destruction  it is said the first wave of a tsunami
OTuph9pJWU4,334880,340479,is not the strongest  but the successive waves are bigger and
OTuph9pJWU4,340479,345680,stronger  oh  and tsunamis can travel at a speed of
OTuph9pJWU4,345680,353520,about 500 miles per hour  which is almost as fast as a jet plane
OTuph9pJWU4,353520,360080,and that's why tsunami waves are called  killer waves deadly isn't it
OTuph9pJWU4,360080,367680,trivia time  did you know that a tsunami wave can be  less than 30 centimeters in height and
OTuph9pJWU4,367680,373199,can pass off unnoticed  if you get stuck in a tsunami don't swim
OTuph9pJWU4,373199,380400,because the currents will pull you in  the opposite direction  just hold on to a floating object and be
OTuph9pJWU4,380400,387440,safe  so here's the deal go watch this video  to know more about earthquakes after all
OTuph9pJWU4,387440,394410,that's one of the major causes of a  tsunami this is me  zooming out
OTuph9pJWU4,394410,400000,[Music]  hello
OTuph9pJWU4,400000,406479,it's quite windy today so i thought i'll  take a quick flight
OTuph9pJWU4,407280,413280,it sure is windy  oh no it's a storm
OTuph9pJWU4,413280,418720,you mean hurricane  pumpkin stop whatever just run
OTuph9pJWU4,418720,426400,you mean fly oh forget it just calm down  oh okay well that reminds me that
OTuph9pJWU4,426400,431840,today's topic is hurricane  zoom in
OTuph9pJWU4,431840,438800,whoa  a hurricane is a huge storm that  generally forms over warm ocean waters
OTuph9pJWU4,438800,443840,near the equator  the warm air above the ocean rises
OTuph9pJWU4,443840,448880,upward  thus creating an area of low pressure  below
OTuph9pJWU4,448880,454560,air from the surrounding areas push in  and try to fill the area with low air
OTuph9pJWU4,454560,460639,pressure  which now becomes warm and moist and  rises too
OTuph9pJWU4,460639,466319,as the moist air rises the surrounding  air again tries to fill in
OTuph9pJWU4,466319,472240,and this process continues till the  water in the air forms clouds
OTuph9pJWU4,472240,477840,soon the clouds and winds spin around  fueled by the ocean's heat and water
OTuph9pJWU4,477840,485680,vapor  therefore hurricanes could also be  called giant engines that use warm and
OTuph9pJWU4,485680,490960,moist air as their fuel  when we see from the top hurricanes can
OTuph9pJWU4,490960,498160,be as huge as 300 miles wide  the center of the hurricane is called
OTuph9pJWU4,498160,505919,the eye of the hurricane which is the  calmest part  the eye wall surrounds the eye where the
OTuph9pJWU4,505919,514240,most damaging winds are found  it can range anywhere from 5 to 30 miles
OTuph9pJWU4,514240,521599,then comes the rain bands which surround  the eye wall  these bands are a series of dense clouds
OTuph9pJWU4,521599,530640,that give a pinwheel-like appearance to  the hurricane  which range from 50 to 300 miles
OTuph9pJWU4,530640,537440,hurricanes are divided into five  categories  depending on the speed of their wind
OTuph9pJWU4,537440,542480,here take a look  category three  four
OTuph9pJWU4,542480,549200,and five are the most dangerous ones  trivia time
OTuph9pJWU4,549200,556080,a huge hurricane can release energy  equivalent to 10 atomic bombs per second
OTuph9pJWU4,556080,562519,hurricanes in the pacific ocean are  known as typhoons
OTuph9pJWU4,562880,570880,so this is me zooming out  twinkle twinkle little star
OTuph9pJWU4,570880,579680,oh i wonder what you are  like the baby star has slept but hey you
OTuph9pJWU4,579680,584800,don't go to sleep because i'm here to  tell you about different types of stars
OTuph9pJWU4,584800,590279,in space exciting isn't it
OTuph9pJWU4,590560,598240,so tell me how many stars do you think  are there in the universe  oh come on you can do it
OTuph9pJWU4,598240,606240,yes  well the answer  will be given at the end of this episode
OTuph9pJWU4,606240,612000,zoom in  so there are different kinds of stars
OTuph9pJWU4,612000,619360,the big ones even bigger than the sun  small ones some very odd ones and some
OTuph9pJWU4,619360,624720,new ones  but did you know that they are  classified in groups
OTuph9pJWU4,624720,630079,yes there are some specific types of  stars
OTuph9pJWU4,630079,635839,the red dwarf stars they are relatively  smaller in size compared to the other
OTuph9pJWU4,635839,641920,stars and therefore they burn at a lower  temperature which helps them have a long
OTuph9pJWU4,641920,649120,sustainable life  some say a trillion years  nearly 70 percent of the stars in the
OTuph9pJWU4,649120,655040,universe are red dwarf stars  but hey since they don't shine so bright
OTuph9pJWU4,655040,661279,it gets difficult for humans to see them  with naked eyes
OTuph9pJWU4,661279,668480,the yellow stars  these are medium-sized stars and  therefore burn at a medium temperature
OTuph9pJWU4,668480,676000,there are yellow dwarf stars as well  that are not giant stars  our sun is one of them
OTuph9pJWU4,676000,682079,these stars become quite large just  before they completely start running out  of fuel
OTuph9pJWU4,682079,688560,the santu will completely lose its fuel  someday but don't worry that won't
OTuph9pJWU4,688560,694560,happen before 5 billion years  blue giant stars
OTuph9pJWU4,694560,699680,as the name suggests  these are big stars and hens burn at a
OTuph9pJWU4,699680,705519,high temperature  leaving them with a short span of life  from 10 000
OTuph9pJWU4,705519,710800,to 100 000 years  most of the stars you see in the sky are
OTuph9pJWU4,710800,716240,blue giant stars  when these stars die unlike other stars
OTuph9pJWU4,716240,722079,they don't shrink but explode  and this type of explosion illuminates
OTuph9pJWU4,722079,727920,the entire sky  there are all sorts of other stars like
OTuph9pJWU4,727920,735680,giant and super giant stars  which are extremely big  have the shortest life span and shine
OTuph9pJWU4,735680,740720,the brightest  trim your time
OTuph9pJWU4,740720,746639,every sun that you see in the sky is  actually bigger than the sun
OTuph9pJWU4,746639,752350,proxima centauri a red dwarf star is the  nearest star to earth after the sun
OTuph9pJWU4,752350,759600,[Music]  so  remember the question i asked you  how many stars do you think are there in
OTuph9pJWU4,759600,765120,the universe  well the answer is  a hundred billion
OTuph9pJWU4,765120,771360,isn't that a shocker  i can see stars in your eyes
OTuph9pJWU4,771360,776800,so this is me zooming out  whoa
OTuph9pJWU4,776800,782639,oops  i gotta be more careful  oh hello friends
OTuph9pJWU4,782639,787920,i am in space today but you know why
OTuph9pJWU4,787920,793760,to tell you about these magnificent  solar objects
OTuph9pJWU4,793920,801279,comets  let's zoom in  [Applause]  comets are one of the most rare objects
OTuph9pJWU4,801279,807200,in the solar system often known as the  dirt balls of the solar system
OTuph9pJWU4,807200,814240,that's because they are made of dust and  ice  wrapping themselves around a small rocky
OTuph9pJWU4,814240,820959,core  astronomers believe that comets are  leftovers from the beginning of the
OTuph9pJWU4,820959,826399,solar system  but hey  they don't look like leftovers at all
OTuph9pJWU4,826399,832079,they appear magical when they reflect  light from the sun  that's right
OTuph9pJWU4,832079,838959,comets do not have their own light  they are reflectors of light
OTuph9pJWU4,838959,845519,when a comet travels towards the sun the  radiation and heat cause solar winds
OTuph9pJWU4,845519,851600,which often blow the gas and dust of the  comet and therefore it appears as if the
OTuph9pJWU4,851600,857839,tail is behind the comet  and when the comet travels away from the
OTuph9pJWU4,857839,863839,sun  the tail is formed in front of the comet
OTuph9pJWU4,864320,872079,well  have you ever wondered where are comets  usually found yes yes they do orbit
OTuph9pJWU4,872079,878240,around the sun mostly but they spend  billions of years in the kuiper belt or
OTuph9pJWU4,878240,883360,in the wood clouds  the kuiper belt is found beyond the
OTuph9pJWU4,883360,889360,orbit of neptune the wood clouds are  found in the outermost reaches of the
OTuph9pJWU4,889360,894959,sky  and comets live here because it's cold  here
OTuph9pJWU4,894959,900560,unfortunately they don't live long once  they enter the warmer part of the solar
OTuph9pJWU4,900560,906560,system  traveling through the inner solar system  eventually kills them
OTuph9pJWU4,906560,913120,and after several thousand years  they melt  all
OTuph9pJWU4,913120,921279,trim your time  i know you wouldn't but if you ever plan  to go inside a comet you'll be hit by
OTuph9pJWU4,921279,927600,microscopic pieces of dust  the name comment was given by aristotle
OTuph9pJWU4,927600,933519,meaning hair of the head  [Music]
OTuph9pJWU4,933519,939680,hey all my teeny tiny friends  the most famous comet the halley's
OTuph9pJWU4,939680,944800,comment will appear in the sky in 2061
OTuph9pJWU4,944800,951839,but don't worry you don't have to wait  that much to see me the next time
OTuph9pJWU4,951839,957120,this is me zooming out  [Music]
OTuph9pJWU4,957120,963600,oh  it's dark here  and i can't see you  oh wait
OTuph9pJWU4,963600,968720,hey there  wonder what we do without lights right
OTuph9pJWU4,968720,975360,so come on let's talk about light today  zoom in
OTuph9pJWU4,975519,982639,light is a form of energy made of  photons  a photon is the smallest unit of visible
OTuph9pJWU4,982639,991759,light  now you ask me how does light travel  well light is unique as it behaves both
OTuph9pJWU4,991759,997680,like a particle and a wave that behaves  differently with different kinds of
OTuph9pJWU4,997680,1005680,matter  if light hits an object and passes  through it  that object is known as a transparent
OTuph9pJWU4,1005680,1012480,object  let's do one thing take a glass of water  and switch on a torch
OTuph9pJWU4,1012480,1019759,see the light passing through  well  this proves that water is transparent
OTuph9pJWU4,1019759,1025120,there are certain objects through which  light cannot pass and it changes its
OTuph9pJWU4,1025120,1031918,path after hitting the object  these objects are called opaque objects
OTuph9pJWU4,1031918,1038880,such as wood  the mobile you're using right now and  you as well
OTuph9pJWU4,1038880,1045918,yeah  humans are opaque as well  some objects allow light to pass through
OTuph9pJWU4,1045918,1052720,them partially and they are known as  translucent objects such as plastic
OTuph9pJWU4,1052720,1060559,butter paper  and frosted glass  and do you know what travels the fastest
OTuph9pJWU4,1060559,1067520,no not a space rocket  well  it's light in vacuum where there's no
OTuph9pJWU4,1067520,1075120,obstacle  light travels at a speed of more than  0.1 million miles per second
OTuph9pJWU4,1075120,1081520,okay so the distance between the sun and  earth is 93 million miles
OTuph9pJWU4,1081520,1088960,but it takes only eight minutes for  light to reach the earth that's a  whopping speed isn't it
OTuph9pJWU4,1088960,1094080,when light travels through different  mediums it slows down and sometimes
OTuph9pJWU4,1094080,1099440,bends and this bending of light is known  as refraction
OTuph9pJWU4,1099440,1105679,take a beaker filled with water and  place a pencil in it  now look carefully
OTuph9pJWU4,1105679,1113360,do you see a bend in the pencil  [Music]  no no the pencil didn't bend
OTuph9pJWU4,1113360,1120160,the light rays just got refracted  that's why you see the pencil bent
OTuph9pJWU4,1120160,1127520,trim your time  did you know that humans are  bioluminescent which means that they
OTuph9pJWU4,1127520,1133360,emit light  but their glow is one thousand times  weaker than what the naked eye can
OTuph9pJWU4,1133360,1139679,register  light takes approximately 1.2 seconds to
OTuph9pJWU4,1139679,1145840,reach the moon from the earth  so friends did i not light up your
OTuph9pJWU4,1145840,1150200,tickling brain cells today
OTuph9pJWU4,1154080,1159600,hi friends did you just see that mighty  beast  well
OTuph9pJWU4,1159600,1164960,that's a shark  hey that's not done i'm no beast dr
OTuph9pJWU4,1164960,1171039,bynox i mean look at my voice and look  at me i'm a tiny little being
OTuph9pJWU4,1171039,1177679,oh i'm sorry mr shark i was kidding i  know you are not a beast but a lot of
OTuph9pJWU4,1177679,1183360,people think you are so why don't you  clear that myth today my friend
OTuph9pJWU4,1183360,1190559,that's a good idea  friends wanna bust some myths about  sharks today i know you do
OTuph9pJWU4,1190559,1197919,come zoom in  it is said that most sharks are  man-eaters and they deliberately hunt
OTuph9pJWU4,1197919,1205120,humans  which is not completely true  mook sharks tend to eat fish or
OTuph9pJWU4,1205120,1212080,invertebrates such as squids or clams  if sharks happen to kill humans it's
OTuph9pJWU4,1212080,1219039,mostly because of mistaken identity  sharks mostly mistake humans to be some
OTuph9pJWU4,1219039,1224159,fish or another animal  i'm sure you would have heard the sharks
OTuph9pJWU4,1224159,1233120,have lots and lots of sharp pointed  teeth  well  not all sharks have icicle-like thief
OTuph9pJWU4,1233120,1238960,the basking shark has tiny teeth  which it does not even use for hunting
OTuph9pJWU4,1238960,1245840,or feeding and the horn shark has  molar-like teeth  which is used to crush its hard-shed
OTuph9pJWU4,1245840,1252000,prey  it is often believed that sharks are  indiscriminate killers
OTuph9pJWU4,1252000,1257919,but most of the times they are victims  of massive hunting for their fins which
OTuph9pJWU4,1257919,1262360,is made into shark soups
OTuph9pJWU4,1263520,1270720,oh  people claim that shark fins are tasty  and have a lot of nutritional value
OTuph9pJWU4,1270720,1277840,which is absolutely untrue  shark fins are tasteless with absolutely
OTuph9pJWU4,1277840,1284080,no nutritional value  and if you think sharks have no  predators
OTuph9pJWU4,1284080,1289280,you're wrong  humans are their biggest predators
OTuph9pJWU4,1289280,1297919,if you actually look at numbers you'll  be surprised to know that sharks kill  approximately six humans in one year
OTuph9pJWU4,1297919,1303679,whereas humans kill about 100 billion  now
OTuph9pJWU4,1303679,1309600,that's called being indiscriminate  sharks also help a lot in maintaining
OTuph9pJWU4,1309600,1317039,the balance of life  since they are the top of the food chain  they keep the marine population in check
OTuph9pJWU4,1317039,1322159,trivia time  there are approximately 500 species of
OTuph9pJWU4,1322159,1328240,shark out of which white sharks tiger  sharks and bull sharks are the most
OTuph9pJWU4,1328240,1336159,dangerous ones  sharks have an extremely strong sense of  smell almost two-thirds of its brain is
OTuph9pJWU4,1336159,1342640,dedicated to the sense of smell  so friends now you know that sharks are
OTuph9pJWU4,1342640,1347840,a lot more than their scary teeth  you're right dr biodox thanks for
OTuph9pJWU4,1347840,1354960,clearing the silly myths about me i owe  you one  oh come on let's drink some soup
OTuph9pJWU4,1354960,1361520,uh oh really soup  not shark fin soup
OTuph9pJWU4,1361520,1368559,oh there you go  so this is me zooming out
OTuph9pJWU4,1368559,1374799,hello kids  won't it be great if we could just pack  up bags and keep flying from place to
OTuph9pJWU4,1374799,1381280,place  hey but you can't do that because you  don't have wings like me
OTuph9pJWU4,1381280,1386400,oh yes you're right but there's one  major difference between you and my
OTuph9pJWU4,1386400,1392320,friends out there and that is  you're a migratory bird silly
OTuph9pJWU4,1392320,1399039,oh  oops why didn't that strike me  doesn't matter you go take your flight
OTuph9pJWU4,1399039,1408640,and i'll tell my friends all about birds  like you  oh i feel so special dr binox
OTuph9pJWU4,1408640,1415280,come friends let's know more about  migratory birds  zoom in
OTuph9pJWU4,1415280,1424000,migratory birds are those birds that  travel from one place to another at  regular intervals over long distances
OTuph9pJWU4,1424000,1429520,and they migrate to escape the cold  harsh winter weather in search of food
OTuph9pJWU4,1429520,1434880,and a warm cozy shelter  there are various types of migratory
OTuph9pJWU4,1434880,1441440,birds  resident birds pigeons and doves are  good examples
OTuph9pJWU4,1441440,1447760,these birds just don't migrate they are  able to find food and a warm shelter
OTuph9pJWU4,1447760,1455840,where they are staying  we might not travel a lot dr binocks but  we do spread love all around from place
OTuph9pJWU4,1455840,1463200,to place  short distant migrants  robins are short distant migrants
OTuph9pJWU4,1463200,1468400,as the name suggests  these birds move only a short distance
OTuph9pJWU4,1468400,1475120,from lower elevations to  mountainside hey  but don't you mistake me for a
OTuph9pJWU4,1475120,1481360,nightingale i might look like one but  i'm not okay oh my friends won't they
OTuph9pJWU4,1481360,1487440,are very smart aren't you guys  distant migrants
OTuph9pJWU4,1487440,1492559,these birds travel over distances that  cover several states
OTuph9pJWU4,1492559,1498080,they don't really travel a lot but not  that they won't travel less isn't it mr
OTuph9pJWU4,1498080,1504559,blue jay hmm you seem to know me quite  well dr bynox but there's one more
OTuph9pJWU4,1504559,1511039,secret about me wanna know  sure tell us  we are all waiting
OTuph9pJWU4,1511039,1519200,hmm i'm quite mischievous dr binox  because i hunt more than i can eat
OTuph9pJWU4,1519200,1527120,long distant migrants  these birds travel typically from united  states and canada to wintering grounds
OTuph9pJWU4,1527120,1533440,in central and south america the arctic  turn is an example of long-distance
OTuph9pJWU4,1533440,1540840,migrants and i am the record holder for  covering the longest distance of 44 000
OTuph9pJWU4,1540840,1547120,miles oh my that's huge  just to let you know the circumference
OTuph9pJWU4,1547120,1552320,of the earth is approximately 29 000  miles
OTuph9pJWU4,1552320,1558880,so imagine  how much these birds travel  trim your time
OTuph9pJWU4,1558880,1564159,before migrating many birds enter a  state of hyperphasia where the hormone
OTuph9pJWU4,1564159,1569200,levels compel them to drastically  increase their body weight to stow fat
OTuph9pJWU4,1569200,1575440,to use as energy while traveling  and some birds also have the ability to
OTuph9pJWU4,1575440,1580799,sense the earth's magnetic field to help  them navigate
OTuph9pJWU4,1580799,1586400,so i need to travel now wait till i come  back next
OTuph9pJWU4,1586400,1594400,i feel plants are the nicest beings on  this planet  they never harm anyone rather they get
OTuph9pJWU4,1594400,1600000,eaten all the time  oops  i guess some eat too
OTuph9pJWU4,1600000,1606480,and that's why i'm here today to tell  you about plants that eat meat
OTuph9pJWU4,1606480,1612400,come with me  zoom in  plants that capture preys such as
OTuph9pJWU4,1612400,1617760,insects spiders mites and eat meat for  their survival are known as
OTuph9pJWU4,1617760,1623760,insectivorous or carnivorous plants  most of the carnivorous plants live in
OTuph9pJWU4,1623760,1629279,wet buggy areas where the soil doesn't  have much nutrients
OTuph9pJWU4,1629279,1635360,they derive their nutrients from their  preys  and whatever little nutrients available
OTuph9pJWU4,1635360,1640399,to them through soil  they have a strong digestive system
OTuph9pJWU4,1640399,1646559,which helps break down complex food  items  the different types of carnivorous
OTuph9pJWU4,1646559,1654240,plants are  pitfall traps  popularly known as pitcher plants they
OTuph9pJWU4,1654240,1660159,are pitcher plants because they look  like pitcher-shaped vessels  filled with fluid
OTuph9pJWU4,1660159,1665520,the insect is lowered by the syrupy  fluid and just when they come to drink
OTuph9pJWU4,1665520,1673440,it they get drowned some pitcher plants  have a lid on them to trap their preys
OTuph9pJWU4,1673440,1678720,fly paper traps  some fly paper traps have leaves covered
OTuph9pJWU4,1678720,1686559,with a sticky substance on which the  prey gets caught  these plants also digest their preys
OTuph9pJWU4,1686559,1693600,through their leaves  other kind of fly paper traps use  tentacle-like stalks covered with glands
OTuph9pJWU4,1693600,1699520,to trap and digest insects  their stalks have digestive soup on them
OTuph9pJWU4,1699520,1707520,to absorb the nutrients  snap traps  venus fly trap is the most popular snap
OTuph9pJWU4,1707520,1714240,trap  here the plant has mouth-like leaves  that literally snap shut when an insect
OTuph9pJWU4,1714240,1721440,or spider lands on it  there are some snap traps that are found
OTuph9pJWU4,1721440,1730320,under water  and they are known as water wheel plants  they do the same thing but under water
OTuph9pJWU4,1730320,1736320,bladder traps  plants of this kind work in the most  interesting way
OTuph9pJWU4,1736320,1743679,where there are sacks on the plant known  as bladders  that create vacuum and suck the insect
OTuph9pJWU4,1743679,1748960,to digest it later  lobster pot traps
OTuph9pJWU4,1748960,1754559,the plant first lures its insects with  its sweet smelling nectar
OTuph9pJWU4,1754559,1760240,once the insect is trapped inside  it sees light shining through the leaves
OTuph9pJWU4,1760240,1766159,which looks like exits  to escape the insect travels towards the
OTuph9pJWU4,1766159,1772559,light which is nothing but another trap  this is the plant's way of actually
OTuph9pJWU4,1772559,1778559,misdirecting the insect to the inside of  the pitcher where it is caught and eaten
OTuph9pJWU4,1778559,1786080,by the digestive liquids  trim your time  some pitcher plants are so large they
OTuph9pJWU4,1786080,1792960,can catch and consume rats  and frogs  some carnivorous plants reflect
OTuph9pJWU4,1792960,1799760,ultraviolet light to attract their  praise  hey don't go there
OTuph9pJWU4,1799760,1805790,wait i'll help you  let go
OTuph9pJWU4,1805790,1812000,[Applause]  [Music]  so this is me zooming out
OTuph9pJWU4,1813279,1818480,who's that hey you're disturbing the air  around us
OTuph9pJWU4,1818480,1823679,sorry i know i'm farting a lot today  oops
OTuph9pJWU4,1823679,1828799,hmm  guess you took in a lot of carbon  dioxide for lunch yesterday
OTuph9pJWU4,1828799,1835039,oh yeah could be  did you just hear them friends oh no not
OTuph9pJWU4,1835039,1840240,their thoughts  and that reminds me that i need to tell
OTuph9pJWU4,1840240,1845919,you about the process of excretion in  plants  come with me
OTuph9pJWU4,1845919,1853120,zoom in  just like humans plants to feel the need  to remove all sorts of waste material
OTuph9pJWU4,1853120,1859679,from their bodies however plants have a  much simpler process of excretion
OTuph9pJWU4,1859679,1867120,hey did you know that plants sweat well  yes  just like humans have sweat glands
OTuph9pJWU4,1867120,1872480,plants have small openings under their  leaves  called stomata
OTuph9pJWU4,1872480,1878240,that release water and oxygen  just how the pose of your body release
OTuph9pJWU4,1878240,1885650,sweat  but  their waste material is a lot more  useful than us
OTuph9pJWU4,1885650,1893279,[Music]  plants also release waste by  accumulating it in the vacuoles of aging
OTuph9pJWU4,1893279,1900640,leave cells the leaves then fall off  eventually removing the waste material
OTuph9pJWU4,1900640,1907039,this process is known as abscission  don't you sometimes have dry skin that
OTuph9pJWU4,1907039,1914000,eventually falls off  yep kind the same  have you noticed leaves changing their
OTuph9pJWU4,1914000,1921039,color in autumn  this happens mostly because of the waste  pigments that start getting stored
OTuph9pJWU4,1921039,1926480,inside the leaves  see the sticky fluid  well
OTuph9pJWU4,1926480,1933039,this is another kind of waste produced  by the plants  which is often oozed out from the bark
OTuph9pJWU4,1933039,1938960,of trees apart from the sticky fluid  there are other waste products like
OTuph9pJWU4,1938960,1946880,resins  gums  and latex  but hey  you got to be careful because sometimes
OTuph9pJWU4,1946880,1952159,these products can be poisonous  but most of the other times they are
OTuph9pJWU4,1952159,1959440,quite useful for example latex is used  to produce gloves and clothing
OTuph9pJWU4,1959440,1967039,trim your  time the bark of a willow tree produces  a chemical that helps in the making of
OTuph9pJWU4,1967039,1972080,aspirin  a medicine for pain and fever
OTuph9pJWU4,1972080,1979919,oak leaves turn brown due to the waste  material in them  so friends plant more and more trees
OTuph9pJWU4,1979919,1985200,because they are the reason why you can  breathe
OTuph9pJWU4,1985550,1991760,[Music]  breathe in breathing out that's what i
OTuph9pJWU4,1991760,1997039,say throughout breathe in  breathing out that's what i say
OTuph9pJWU4,1997039,2003840,throughout  [Music]  oh so you've been watching me work out
OTuph9pJWU4,2003840,2009279,eh  rather breathe in and breathe out
OTuph9pJWU4,2009279,2015840,oh this is tiring  so anyways  why don't we talk about breathing today
OTuph9pJWU4,2015840,2020960,still can't get a hint  well today we talk about the human
OTuph9pJWU4,2020960,2028159,respiratory system zoom in  all right do this right now i'm watching
OTuph9pJWU4,2028159,2036320,you  just start running wherever you are run  run run run run run
OTuph9pJWU4,2036320,2043360,now stop  isn't your breathing heavy  well that's because right now your body
OTuph9pJWU4,2043360,2050079,needs more oxygen to breathe and you get  oxygen from the air around you
OTuph9pJWU4,2050079,2056158,without oxygen you'd be like a car  without fuel  a waterless spool
OTuph9pJWU4,2056158,2061280,and wouldn't that be uncool  one of the major reasons why you're
OTuph9pJWU4,2061280,2067590,alive is  oxygen  so  take a deep breath in
OTuph9pJWU4,2067590,2075919,[Music]  when you breathe in you take an oxygen  present in the air the air then passes
OTuph9pJWU4,2075919,2083690,through your nostrils  there are tiny hair present in your  nostrils that obstruct
OTuph9pJWU4,2083690,2090158,[Music]  all the dust particles  then the air travels to the windpipe
OTuph9pJWU4,2090158,2096240,also called the trachea which filters  the air inhaled
OTuph9pJWU4,2096240,2103760,the trachea branches out to two tubes  called bronchi  where tiny hair called cilia move back
OTuph9pJWU4,2103760,2110240,and forth moving the mucus inside  the mucus is a sticky substance that
OTuph9pJWU4,2110240,2118480,collects germs and other particles that  might harm the lungs  the bronchi then carry air into each
OTuph9pJWU4,2118480,2125680,lung  the right lung has three lobes whereas  the left lung has two lobes
OTuph9pJWU4,2125680,2131520,the left lung is slightly smaller in  size to give space to the heart
OTuph9pJWU4,2131520,2137599,these lobes are filled with small and  spongy air sacs called alveoli
OTuph9pJWU4,2137599,2142720,where the exchange of oxygen and carbon  dioxide happens
OTuph9pJWU4,2142720,2149040,it is here the blood picks up oxygen and  lets go of carbon dioxide
OTuph9pJWU4,2149040,2154880,just beneath the lungs there is a  dome-shaped muscle called diaphragm
OTuph9pJWU4,2154880,2160880,that contracts when you breathe in and  expands when you breathe out
OTuph9pJWU4,2160880,2166720,it also separates the chest cavity from  the abdominal cavity
OTuph9pJWU4,2166720,2173200,trivia time  [Music]  the lungs are the only organs that can
OTuph9pJWU4,2173200,2178480,float on water  a person breathes approximately 20 000
OTuph9pJWU4,2178480,2184800,times in one day  so friends  didn't you just gasp and grasp all the
OTuph9pJWU4,2184800,2192200,facts  this is me  zooming out
