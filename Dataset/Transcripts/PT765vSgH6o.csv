PT765vSgH6o,4960,7600,why do so many people come to the us to
PT765vSgH6o,7600,9920,get their education if we look at top 10
PT765vSgH6o,9920,12160,universities in the world eight of them
PT765vSgH6o,12160,14719,will be here in the united states top
PT765vSgH6o,14719,17359,researchers professors work in american
PT765vSgH6o,17359,19039,universities
PT765vSgH6o,19039,22480,graduates work as ceos of top companies
PT765vSgH6o,22480,25439,they are prime ministers of countries if
PT765vSgH6o,25439,27119,you graduate from an american university
PT765vSgH6o,27119,29279,as an international student under
PT765vSgH6o,29279,31519,certain conditions you can stay here for
PT765vSgH6o,31519,34160,up to three years to work also there is
PT765vSgH6o,34160,36480,an opportunity to get financial aid for
PT765vSgH6o,36480,38879,your education especially if you are
PT765vSgH6o,38879,41840,doing your master's or phd but for me
PT765vSgH6o,41840,44480,education in the us is being a part of
PT765vSgH6o,44480,46640,this amazing community of talented
PT765vSgH6o,46640,47600,people
PT765vSgH6o,47600,49760,setting with them spending years of your
PT765vSgH6o,49760,51760,life together with them american
PT765vSgH6o,51760,54399,university is not just a building it's a
PT765vSgH6o,54399,57199,small town with its own museum
PT765vSgH6o,57199,58480,church
PT765vSgH6o,58480,59920,stadium
PT765vSgH6o,59920,62399,labs let's walk around stanford campus
PT765vSgH6o,62399,64320,today and talk about education in the
PT765vSgH6o,64320,66320,usa i'm going to talk about
PT765vSgH6o,66320,68080,how you can study here what do you need
PT765vSgH6o,68080,70080,to do to get admitted how you can get
PT765vSgH6o,70080,71360,financial aid and if you're an
PT765vSgH6o,71360,73200,international student how you can get a
PT765vSgH6o,73200,75840,visa let's walk around and talk about
PT765vSgH6o,75840,77380,education in the usa
PT765vSgH6o,77380,83520,[Music]
PT765vSgH6o,83520,84960,let's talk about different levels of
PT765vSgH6o,84960,87439,education in the us so you can come here
PT765vSgH6o,87439,89520,for your high school
PT765vSgH6o,89520,91680,but if you're an international student i
PT765vSgH6o,91680,93600,think it is better that you graduate
PT765vSgH6o,93600,95759,from school in your own country because
PT765vSgH6o,95759,97360,if you graduate from a school here in
PT765vSgH6o,97360,99520,the us when you apply for university
PT765vSgH6o,99520,101520,they would actually look at your school
PT765vSgH6o,101520,104320,ranking and your gpa your average grade
PT765vSgH6o,104320,105840,there when you come from your own
PT765vSgH6o,105840,107840,country they can't really tell whether
PT765vSgH6o,107840,110880,the school was challenging or not so you
PT765vSgH6o,110880,112799,have higher chances of getting admitted
PT765vSgH6o,112799,114399,because you have higher chances of
PT765vSgH6o,114399,116560,getting a perfect score back in your
PT765vSgH6o,116560,118799,country and another thing if you come
PT765vSgH6o,118799,120880,here for your high school that means new
PT765vSgH6o,120880,123200,curriculum new environment new language
PT765vSgH6o,123200,125439,and there might be a chance that your
PT765vSgH6o,125439,128879,grades become lower so ideally if i were
PT765vSgH6o,128879,130479,you i would graduate from high school in
PT765vSgH6o,130479,131760,my own country
PT765vSgH6o,131760,134160,and then come here either for bachelors
PT765vSgH6o,134160,136480,it typically takes about four years to
PT765vSgH6o,136480,138640,earn a bachelor's degree in your first
PT765vSgH6o,138640,141120,two years of study you will be required
PT765vSgH6o,141120,143360,to take a wide variety of classes in
PT765vSgH6o,143360,145760,different subjects commonly known as
PT765vSgH6o,145760,149040,prerequisite courses literature science
PT765vSgH6o,149040,151840,social sciences arts history and so
PT765vSgH6o,151840,154400,forth this way you can achieve general
PT765vSgH6o,154400,155840,knowledge to get admitted to a
PT765vSgH6o,155840,158000,bachelor's program you would need to
PT765vSgH6o,158000,161760,take an sat or a ct and if you come from
PT765vSgH6o,161760,163920,a non-english speaking country you would
PT765vSgH6o,163920,166560,need to take a test like toefl or ielts
PT765vSgH6o,166560,168319,and some colleges also accept the
PT765vSgH6o,168319,170560,duolingo test please check the exact
PT765vSgH6o,170560,173280,requirements and exams on the website of
PT765vSgH6o,173280,175280,the universities you want to apply to
PT765vSgH6o,175280,177599,and bachelor's is not the best level of
PT765vSgH6o,177599,179519,education in terms of financial aid
PT765vSgH6o,179519,180800,because it's not really finance
PT765vSgH6o,180800,182319,especially for international students
PT765vSgH6o,182319,184239,there is also an option to get admitted
PT765vSgH6o,184239,186720,to a bachelor's program without taking
PT765vSgH6o,186720,189599,any exams to do this you can take a
PT765vSgH6o,189599,192080,program called pathway for one semester
PT765vSgH6o,192080,193040,or more
PT765vSgH6o,193040,195120,pathway programs are introductory
PT765vSgH6o,195120,197200,courses that are designed to help
PT765vSgH6o,197200,199120,international students build the skills
PT765vSgH6o,199120,201200,and knowledge that they need in order to
PT765vSgH6o,201200,203360,continue their degree some pathway
PT765vSgH6o,203360,205360,programs even offer guaranteed admission
PT765vSgH6o,205360,207440,to a partner institution however the
PT765vSgH6o,207440,209519,cost of these programs is quite high
PT765vSgH6o,209519,210879,it's also important to remember that
PT765vSgH6o,210879,213120,it's highly unlikely that you'll get
PT765vSgH6o,213120,215040,financial aid after finishing the
PT765vSgH6o,215040,217120,pathway program the best thing you could
PT765vSgH6o,217120,220080,do in terms of like financial aid and
PT765vSgH6o,220080,222080,stuff you can come here for master's and
PT765vSgH6o,222080,224000,phd in order to get admitted to a
PT765vSgH6o,224000,226080,master's program you need to take either
PT765vSgH6o,226080,228879,gmat or gre gmat you take it for
PT765vSgH6o,228879,230560,economics related
PT765vSgH6o,230560,232879,master's programs gre
PT765vSgH6o,232879,234319,is for everything else and some
PT765vSgH6o,234319,235840,universities don't require you to take
PT765vSgH6o,235840,237840,gmat and gre and then you take toefl or
PT765vSgH6o,237840,239439,isles to prove your english language
PT765vSgH6o,239439,242720,proficiency if you want to do a phd in
PT765vSgH6o,242720,244239,addition to everything that i mentioned
PT765vSgH6o,244239,245840,you would need to propose a topic for
PT765vSgH6o,245840,247840,your research but a cool thing about a
PT765vSgH6o,247840,251120,phd there is like 90 chance that you
PT765vSgH6o,251120,253120,will get financial aid but a phd is
PT765vSgH6o,253120,254720,again a four year program you need to
PT765vSgH6o,254720,256720,have your bachelor's from your own
PT765vSgH6o,256720,258320,country or from another american
PT765vSgH6o,258320,260400,university but then it opens up this
PT765vSgH6o,260400,263840,whole world of research and you spend
PT765vSgH6o,263840,266560,four years on campus researching
PT765vSgH6o,266560,268380,studying and maybe teaching as well
PT765vSgH6o,268380,275120,[Music]
PT765vSgH6o,275120,277520,have you ever had this situation where
PT765vSgH6o,277520,279120,you're kind of sure of what you want to
PT765vSgH6o,279120,281040,study and what you want to be when you
PT765vSgH6o,281040,284320,graduate but somehow your schedule
PT765vSgH6o,284320,286720,consists of subjects that you don't
PT765vSgH6o,286720,288400,really need and you feel like you don't
PT765vSgH6o,288400,290320,need this doesn't really happen in the
PT765vSgH6o,290320,293199,us in the u.s every student has an
PT765vSgH6o,293199,295440,individual plan so basically in order to
PT765vSgH6o,295440,297280,graduate in order to receive your
PT765vSgH6o,297280,299600,diploma you need to have certain amount
PT765vSgH6o,299600,301360,of lectures and certain amount of
PT765vSgH6o,301360,302560,seminars
PT765vSgH6o,302560,304880,which basically means that every student
PT765vSgH6o,304880,308320,follows an individual curriculum
PT765vSgH6o,308320,310720,another great thing about american
PT765vSgH6o,310720,312800,education that i personally really like
PT765vSgH6o,312800,315520,is that you can have major and minor for
PT765vSgH6o,315520,317440,example i decided to do marketing so my
PT765vSgH6o,317440,319520,major is marketing but i also want to
PT765vSgH6o,319520,321919,understand the psychology of customers
PT765vSgH6o,321919,324320,so i go to the faculty of psychology and
PT765vSgH6o,324320,326720,i take my minor in psychology and this
PT765vSgH6o,326720,329120,allows you to have this broad education
PT765vSgH6o,329120,331039,in different spheres let's take a look
PT765vSgH6o,331039,333919,at a few popular courses students take
PT765vSgH6o,333919,334960,law
PT765vSgH6o,334960,337440,legal education system in the u.s is one
PT765vSgH6o,337440,339199,of the best in the world students can
PT765vSgH6o,339199,341360,enroll in lower specialties only after
PT765vSgH6o,341360,343520,getting a bachelor's degree direct
PT765vSgH6o,343520,345840,admission with a high school diploma is
PT765vSgH6o,345840,349120,not possible economics it can be finance
PT765vSgH6o,349120,351120,business administration business
PT765vSgH6o,351120,353759,analytics accounting business economics
PT765vSgH6o,353759,356080,etc psychology is a popular and
PT765vSgH6o,356080,358720,widespread subject in the us according
PT765vSgH6o,358720,361360,to statistics four in 10 american adults
PT765vSgH6o,361360,364240,42 percent have seen a counselor at some
PT765vSgH6o,364240,366160,point in their lives environmental
PT765vSgH6o,366160,368560,studies students study modern problems
PT765vSgH6o,368560,370639,of ecology and learn about different
PT765vSgH6o,370639,372800,approaches to solving them computer
PT765vSgH6o,372800,375120,science and computer engineering it is
PT765vSgH6o,375120,376960,december right now
PT765vSgH6o,376960,380400,and i'm wearing a light jacket as a
PT765vSgH6o,380400,381919,person who doesn't like winter and
PT765vSgH6o,381919,384479,doesn't like snow i am so so jealous
PT765vSgH6o,384479,386160,because people get to study in this
PT765vSgH6o,386160,387199,climate
PT765vSgH6o,387199,388720,i attended my university back in
PT765vSgH6o,388720,391680,petersburg and my reality was waking up
PT765vSgH6o,391680,393199,every morning
PT765vSgH6o,393199,396319,and walking through snow
PT765vSgH6o,396319,399199,uh some winters had a lot of snow
PT765vSgH6o,399199,401440,making my way to university
PT765vSgH6o,401440,402639,and if you're watching this and you're
PT765vSgH6o,402639,403680,like
PT765vSgH6o,403680,405280,i am super excited about american
PT765vSgH6o,405280,407199,education but i don't see myself
PT765vSgH6o,407199,409680,spending a year or two in the us
PT765vSgH6o,409680,410960,studying
PT765vSgH6o,410960,412639,there's something i can recommend the
PT765vSgH6o,412639,415039,courses that my husband and i take
PT765vSgH6o,415039,417120,maybe twice a year or even three times a
PT765vSgH6o,417120,418800,year it's called stanford continuing
PT765vSgH6o,418800,421039,studies they have short courses they're
PT765vSgH6o,421039,423120,available online and offline
PT765vSgH6o,423120,426080,they cost like 300 maybe like 600
PT765vSgH6o,426080,427919,but you get the same
PT765vSgH6o,427919,430639,professors stanford professors you get
PT765vSgH6o,430639,432800,amazing community of students
PT765vSgH6o,432800,435280,and the classes are one of the best and
PT765vSgH6o,435280,437440,i think in like if you compare them to
PT765vSgH6o,437440,439520,other courses on the market i took a
PT765vSgH6o,439520,441919,course for 2500
PT765vSgH6o,441919,444160,and it was worse than a 300 course at
PT765vSgH6o,444160,445840,stanford just because stanford has his
PT765vSgH6o,445840,447680,brand and
PT765vSgH6o,447680,448960,because they pay a lot of attention to
PT765vSgH6o,448960,450960,the quality of their education so and
PT765vSgH6o,450960,452639,you don't need to pass any tests you
PT765vSgH6o,452639,454560,just apply pay
PT765vSgH6o,454560,456240,and you take the course so highly
PT765vSgH6o,456240,457759,recommend it if you just want to get
PT765vSgH6o,457759,459440,this taste
PT765vSgH6o,459440,461919,of top american education if you're
PT765vSgH6o,461919,464639,determined to get bachelor's master's or
PT765vSgH6o,464639,467360,phd in american university but you don't
PT765vSgH6o,467360,468879,know where to start
PT765vSgH6o,468879,470639,you don't know what your chances of
PT765vSgH6o,470639,473440,getting financial aid are at linguatrip
PT765vSgH6o,473440,475440,we have excellent specialists who know
PT765vSgH6o,475440,477759,the answers to all your questions
PT765vSgH6o,477759,480720,related to american education if you're
PT765vSgH6o,480720,482319,determined to change your life i will
PT765vSgH6o,482319,484160,leave an email in the description box
PT765vSgH6o,484160,486479,below you can reach out to my team and
PT765vSgH6o,486479,488720,get your questions answered if you want
PT765vSgH6o,488720,490720,to study in the us you need a student
PT765vSgH6o,490720,492879,visa and you might ask me marina is it
PT765vSgH6o,492879,494720,even possible to get a student visa
PT765vSgH6o,494720,496240,right now there are two things you need
PT765vSgH6o,496240,498560,to remember first of all when you apply
PT765vSgH6o,498560,500560,for a u.s student visa
PT765vSgH6o,500560,503120,the task of the us embassy is to make
PT765vSgH6o,503120,505599,sure that you are a genuine student and
PT765vSgH6o,505599,508080,you're not using your education in order
PT765vSgH6o,508080,509840,to just immigrate to the us and that's
PT765vSgH6o,509840,512320,it so you need to prove that first of
PT765vSgH6o,512320,513120,all
PT765vSgH6o,513120,515200,you have applied for a good university
PT765vSgH6o,515200,517680,or good college because sometimes people
PT765vSgH6o,517680,520240,would apply to a low-ranking community
PT765vSgH6o,520240,522240,college that doesn't cost a lot and the
PT765vSgH6o,522240,524640,question the embassy would ask is why
PT765vSgH6o,524640,526560,have you decided to pursue education at
PT765vSgH6o,526560,529360,that institution instead of
PT765vSgH6o,529360,531200,getting education in your own country
PT765vSgH6o,531200,533920,the second thing they're looking for is
PT765vSgH6o,533920,535839,whether you have money to support
PT765vSgH6o,535839,537760,yourself during your education
PT765vSgH6o,537760,539360,if you got full financial aid from a
PT765vSgH6o,539360,540880,university then
PT765vSgH6o,540880,543120,there is like 99 chance i guess that
PT765vSgH6o,543120,544640,you're going to get a visa so just a
PT765vSgH6o,544640,546720,formality but if you did not receive
PT765vSgH6o,546720,548399,financial aid for your education that
PT765vSgH6o,548399,550480,means that you need to prove that you
PT765vSgH6o,550480,552880,have enough funds to support yourself
PT765vSgH6o,552880,554959,the funds could either be yours from
PT765vSgH6o,554959,556880,your employment or you could have a
PT765vSgH6o,556880,558959,sponsor or maybe you've done some really
PT765vSgH6o,558959,561040,good investments and this is what you're
PT765vSgH6o,561040,563440,going to use to support yourself another
PT765vSgH6o,563440,565120,thing that they're looking for is proof
PT765vSgH6o,565120,567120,that these funds are legal that you
PT765vSgH6o,567120,570240,haven't stolen money that it is not like
PT765vSgH6o,570240,572560,a weird loan so you or your sponsor
PT765vSgH6o,572560,574160,would need to show
PT765vSgH6o,574160,576480,a bank statement where you have your
PT765vSgH6o,576480,578480,salary or again your dividends from your
PT765vSgH6o,578480,579839,investments
PT765vSgH6o,579839,582720,and another thing because we're in this
PT765vSgH6o,582720,583920,weird
PT765vSgH6o,583920,587760,era of countries and embassies closing
PT765vSgH6o,587760,590399,you need to check whether u.s embassy is
PT765vSgH6o,590399,592480,open in your country but what we've seen
PT765vSgH6o,592480,594399,at linguatrip when we help our students
PT765vSgH6o,594399,597120,get a visa we see that actually you can
PT765vSgH6o,597120,598560,travel to another country where the
PT765vSgH6o,598560,600880,embassy is open and apply for your visa
PT765vSgH6o,600880,602560,there and again if you're a genuine
PT765vSgH6o,602560,604240,student if you applied for a good
PT765vSgH6o,604240,605839,university there shouldn't be a problem
PT765vSgH6o,605839,608720,and another thing to remember is that
PT765vSgH6o,608720,611279,if you apply to study in the us just
PT765vSgH6o,611279,613040,after you graduate from your school or
PT765vSgH6o,613040,614800,university this looks logical like
PT765vSgH6o,614800,617040,you're continuing your education but if
PT765vSgH6o,617040,619440,there has been a 10-year gap between
PT765vSgH6o,619440,621760,your previous education and
PT765vSgH6o,621760,623600,whatever you're doing now and you're
PT765vSgH6o,623600,625680,willing to travel with your family there
PT765vSgH6o,625680,627839,could be more questions again the
PT765vSgH6o,627839,629680,embassy is always
PT765vSgH6o,629680,631519,willing to know whether you're a genuine
PT765vSgH6o,631519,633760,student or you're just using this
PT765vSgH6o,633760,636000,education to immigrate so you need to
PT765vSgH6o,636000,638480,prove that you are indeed a student who
PT765vSgH6o,638480,641980,is willing to study in the us
PT765vSgH6o,641980,653120,[Music]
PT765vSgH6o,653120,655440,time to talk about money
PT765vSgH6o,655440,658079,unfortunately there is no unified system
PT765vSgH6o,658079,660959,in the u.s that would help settle prices
PT765vSgH6o,660959,663360,for education in the us this is why it
PT765vSgH6o,663360,665519,is super expensive and every university
PT765vSgH6o,665519,668160,comes up with its own pricing
PT765vSgH6o,668160,671440,and you not only have to pay tuition you
PT765vSgH6o,671440,673839,also have to pay for your accommodation
PT765vSgH6o,673839,676320,health insurance books if you're using a
PT765vSgH6o,676320,678560,lab there is an additional fee stanford
PT765vSgH6o,678560,680959,came up with this table that shows how
PT765vSgH6o,680959,682480,much it costs
PT765vSgH6o,682480,684880,to study and live here at stanford but
PT765vSgH6o,684880,686959,you also have to note that stanford is
PT765vSgH6o,686959,688399,one of the most
PT765vSgH6o,688399,690240,if not the most expensive university in
PT765vSgH6o,690240,691279,the country
PT765vSgH6o,691279,693600,and it is located in a place that is
PT765vSgH6o,693600,695680,again one of the most expensive place in
PT765vSgH6o,695680,697519,the country silicon valley but even if
PT765vSgH6o,697519,699760,we talk about cheaper universities it is
PT765vSgH6o,699760,701920,really hard to find something that would
PT765vSgH6o,701920,704480,cost less than twenty thirty thousand
PT765vSgH6o,704480,705920,dollars a year
PT765vSgH6o,705920,707680,this is why a lot of international
PT765vSgH6o,707680,710240,students who are seeking quality
PT765vSgH6o,710240,712560,education in the us are also looking for
PT765vSgH6o,712560,715279,different types of financial aid
PT765vSgH6o,715279,717120,back in 2015 i was able to get full
PT765vSgH6o,717120,719120,financial aid from johns hopkins
PT765vSgH6o,719120,721200,university and university of florida but
PT765vSgH6o,721200,724399,i decided to pursue my entrepreneurial
PT765vSgH6o,724399,726720,career so we moved to silicon valley to
PT765vSgH6o,726720,728160,build our startup
PT765vSgH6o,728160,731680,but let's dig deeper into what kinds of
PT765vSgH6o,731680,733440,financial aid
PT765vSgH6o,733440,735680,you can get as an international student
PT765vSgH6o,735680,738000,in the us the first type of financial
PT765vSgH6o,738000,739600,aid is a grant this is usually a
PT765vSgH6o,739600,741760,one-time payment from the university to
PT765vSgH6o,741760,744399,help students cover their expenses the
PT765vSgH6o,744399,746480,amount of the grant differs depending on
PT765vSgH6o,746480,748480,the institution and may cover different
PT765vSgH6o,748480,751360,types of costs tuition accommodation
PT765vSgH6o,751360,753920,health insurance personal expenses etc
PT765vSgH6o,753920,755760,often the grant is awarded based on
PT765vSgH6o,755760,757920,financial need there is a slight
PT765vSgH6o,757920,759760,difference between a scholarship and a
PT765vSgH6o,759760,762639,stipend stipend in most cases means
PT765vSgH6o,762639,764880,monthly payments from the university
PT765vSgH6o,764880,767440,that cover the students current expenses
PT765vSgH6o,767440,769920,while scholarship is a more complex
PT765vSgH6o,769920,772079,concept which can include both cash
PT765vSgH6o,772079,774000,given to a student and the provision of
PT765vSgH6o,774000,776320,free tuition accommodation and so on
PT765vSgH6o,776320,778320,there are two types of scholarships
PT765vSgH6o,778320,780720,need-based and merit-based need-based is
PT765vSgH6o,780720,782720,financial assistance based on students
PT765vSgH6o,782720,784480,financial situation need-based
PT765vSgH6o,784480,787519,scholarships can cover up to 100 of cost
PT765vSgH6o,787519,790320,of tuition accommodation and meals as a
PT765vSgH6o,790320,792079,rule you'll need to provide documents
PT765vSgH6o,792079,794399,that prove that you and your family is
PT765vSgH6o,794399,796560,in financial need usually this type of
PT765vSgH6o,796560,798959,scholarship is not given to
PT765vSgH6o,798959,800880,international students merit-based
PT765vSgH6o,800880,803279,scholarships however are awarded based
PT765vSgH6o,803279,805600,on academic sports or extracurricular
PT765vSgH6o,805600,807360,achievement and to get this type of
PT765vSgH6o,807360,809440,scholarship you must have high gpa
PT765vSgH6o,809440,811200,academic and extracurricular
PT765vSgH6o,811200,813839,achievements competition conferences
PT765vSgH6o,813839,815839,publications volunteering
PT765vSgH6o,815839,818079,excellent results of the language tests
PT765vSgH6o,818079,821040,ielts toefl etc good results of exams
PT765vSgH6o,821040,824800,like gmat and gre and strong motivation
PT765vSgH6o,824800,826399,letter merit-based scholarships are
PT765vSgH6o,826399,829279,awarded both to local and international
PT765vSgH6o,829279,831199,students you can find more information
PT765vSgH6o,831199,833040,about financial aid on the website of
PT765vSgH6o,833040,834959,universities in a section called
PT765vSgH6o,834959,836959,financial aid i've recently had dinner
PT765vSgH6o,836959,838959,with one of stanford graduates and he
PT765vSgH6o,838959,840240,shared that
PT765vSgH6o,840240,842480,for some amount of time stanford didn't
PT765vSgH6o,842480,844320,really want to accept international
PT765vSgH6o,844320,846320,students because
PT765vSgH6o,846320,848000,in america there is this culture when
PT765vSgH6o,848000,849839,you graduate from a university and you
PT765vSgH6o,849839,852240,become successful you donate millions of
PT765vSgH6o,852240,854160,dollars back to the university and they
PT765vSgH6o,854160,856399,put your name on the building et cetera
PT765vSgH6o,856399,858480,and there was no such culture among
PT765vSgH6o,858480,860720,international students and for stanford
PT765vSgH6o,860720,862160,economics didn't really work on
PT765vSgH6o,862160,863519,international students because they
PT765vSgH6o,863519,865760,didn't do those donations the situation
PT765vSgH6o,865760,868240,has changed but i've talked to several
PT765vSgH6o,868240,869440,friends
PT765vSgH6o,869440,871040,who graduated from stanford or
PT765vSgH6o,871040,872720,international students they told me that
PT765vSgH6o,872720,874320,they would actually share
PT765vSgH6o,874320,876000,money with stanford they would do their
PT765vSgH6o,876000,878000,donations annually because it's the part
PT765vSgH6o,878000,879600,of the culture now because they
PT765vSgH6o,879600,881360,graduated stanford gave them this
PT765vSgH6o,881360,884480,opportunity and they feel obligated
PT765vSgH6o,884480,886160,and they feel that
PT765vSgH6o,886160,887839,they have to make those donations
PT765vSgH6o,887839,889839,something to keep in mind good news if
PT765vSgH6o,889839,891600,you're a student in the us you can
PT765vSgH6o,891600,894000,actually work while you study
PT765vSgH6o,894000,896399,during your first year you can only work
PT765vSgH6o,896399,899199,on campus and the jobs are limited to
PT765vSgH6o,899199,901120,working at a library working at a
PT765vSgH6o,901120,904000,cafeteria which means you don't make a
PT765vSgH6o,904000,905680,lot of money but you're still able to
PT765vSgH6o,905680,908079,cover some of your living expenses
PT765vSgH6o,908079,910399,don't think that it pays too much like
PT765vSgH6o,910399,912880,on average i was in california here from
PT765vSgH6o,912880,915839,15 to 20 an hour and you're allowed to
PT765vSgH6o,915839,919360,work for maximum of 20 hours a week
PT765vSgH6o,919360,921360,once you finish your first year there
PT765vSgH6o,921360,923360,are two options how you can work there's
PT765vSgH6o,923360,926480,an opt optional practical training
PT765vSgH6o,926480,928560,so basically you can find a job either
PT765vSgH6o,928560,931360,on campus or off campus in a company in
PT765vSgH6o,931360,933600,a field that is related
PT765vSgH6o,933600,935120,to something that you study so for
PT765vSgH6o,935120,937360,example if you study economics you can
PT765vSgH6o,937360,939839,find a company who would employ you in
PT765vSgH6o,939839,941759,their financial department but you can't
PT765vSgH6o,941759,943759,really go and work at starbucks if you
PT765vSgH6o,943759,946639,study economics like i mean as a barista
PT765vSgH6o,946639,948560,there's also a thing called cpt
PT765vSgH6o,948560,950880,curriculum practical training
PT765vSgH6o,950880,954160,this is a work opportunity that is tied
PT765vSgH6o,954160,956320,into your curriculum so you have to do
PT765vSgH6o,956320,958000,it and in this case you just go to your
PT765vSgH6o,958000,960160,coordinator and say that you're willing
PT765vSgH6o,960160,962399,to take this opportunity and work
PT765vSgH6o,962399,964959,when we talk about working during
PT765vSgH6o,964959,966880,setting one thing to remember you can
PT765vSgH6o,966880,970000,work for 20 hours a week during the year
PT765vSgH6o,970000,972959,and 40 hours a week during summer
PT765vSgH6o,972959,975360,but unfortunately if you hope that
PT765vSgH6o,975360,978480,you'll be able to cover your tuition or
PT765vSgH6o,978480,980880,all the living expenses while working
PT765vSgH6o,980880,983040,in most cases almost impossible just
PT765vSgH6o,983040,985040,because again you're making maybe what
PT765vSgH6o,985040,988240,fifteen dollars an hour and uh education
PT765vSgH6o,988240,990399,at stanford cost like a hundred thousand
PT765vSgH6o,990399,992800,dollars a year so this is a way to
PT765vSgH6o,992800,995279,support yourself to cover some of your
PT765vSgH6o,995279,997279,living expenses this is a way to get
PT765vSgH6o,997279,999680,some real life experience but don't
PT765vSgH6o,999680,1002480,think of it as a way to finance
PT765vSgH6o,1002480,1004639,your studies unfortunately and now i
PT765vSgH6o,1004639,1006959,want to give you a list of universities
