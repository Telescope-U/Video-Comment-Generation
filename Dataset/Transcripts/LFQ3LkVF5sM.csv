LFQ3LkVF5sM,14910,16110,go brrr.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,16110,18000,Apple obviously knows it.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,18000,19260,And make no mistake.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,19260,21300,"Intel, AMD and NVIDIA"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,21300,22740,all know it too.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,22740,23880,The writing is on the wall.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,23880,25500,And now it's just a matter of time.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,25500,27810,PCs need to change.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,27810,30630,And I'm gonna tell you how and why.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,30630,32375,Right after I tell you about our sponsor.

LFQ3LkVF5sM,53640,55260,- A lot of you really liked our
LFQ3LkVF5sM,55260,57899,"How to build a PC, the last guide you'll ever need!"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,57900,60240,And I'm really glad that you do.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,60240,62700,Because it took so much effort to make.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,62700,64830,But look at that run time.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,64830,66930,And it could have been even longer.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,66930,68700,Think about how many components
LFQ3LkVF5sM,68700,70380,go into a typical PC build.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,70380,73170,And then look at this unassuming little box.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,73170,74310,The Mac Studio.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,74310,76470,In our testing the M1 Ultra variant
LFQ3LkVF5sM,76470,77520,pulled a grand total
LFQ3LkVF5sM,77520,81359,of 223.4 watts from the wall.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,81360,82710,Under the heaviest load
LFQ3LkVF5sM,82710,83670,that we could give it.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,83670,87060,And the M1 Max version didn't even break three digits.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,87060,88829,"If we ignore the Rosetta results,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,88830,92400,"they achieved 88 and 61% respectively,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,92400,94366,of the core I9 12900K
LFQ3LkVF5sM,94366,97350,and the RTX 3090 benches overall performance
LFQ3LkVF5sM,97350,98760,in our productivity testing.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,98760,102210,"At just 34 and 15% of the total system power,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,102210,103260,at most.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,103260,106200,"The 12900K, the CPU alone,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,106200,107850,can draw more power
LFQ3LkVF5sM,107850,111030,than the whole M1 Ultra Mac Studio.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,111030,112710,And developers are still figuring out
LFQ3LkVF5sM,112710,114930,how to optimize for Apple Silicon.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,114930,116940,Now look at that PC
LFQ3LkVF5sM,116940,118440,and all its components again.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,118440,119700,All the raw materials
LFQ3LkVF5sM,119700,121289,that go into making it what it is.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,121290,122430,"It's wasteful, right?"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,122430,123450,"In almost every way,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,123450,124710,except economically.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,124710,127229,"It's not that X86 is inherently bad,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,127230,128610,but it has limitations
LFQ3LkVF5sM,128610,131850,that even Intel have tried to overcome themselves.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,131850,133710,With projects like Itanium.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,133710,135870,"While extensions have given it more life,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,135870,137970,its complex instruction set design
LFQ3LkVF5sM,137970,139110,"is, at its core,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,139110,142230,an old one that dates back to the late 1970s.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,142230,145890,Literally every x86 base CPU boots up
LFQ3LkVF5sM,145890,148080,in 8086 compatibility mode.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,148080,149700,"And can in theory,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,149700,154110,run software made for the OG IBM PC.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,154110,156090,Precious dye space and transistors
LFQ3LkVF5sM,156090,158519,are used for supporting instructions and modes
LFQ3LkVF5sM,158520,159810,"that might be redundant,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,159810,162239,or not even remotely useful today.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,162240,165210,But must be there to maintain compatibility
LFQ3LkVF5sM,165210,166320,with the architecture.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,166320,168270,"And now if I'm Intel or AMD,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,168270,169650,looking at my options.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,169650,170970,I'm sweating a little.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,170970,173190,And weighing a switch to Arm.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,173190,175830,"While neither currently sells an Arm CPU,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,175830,178170,both hold Arm licenses.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,178170,179970,And AMD is on record saying
LFQ3LkVF5sM,179970,182730,that they're willing and able to do it.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,182730,184500,"It wasn't that long ago, even."
LFQ3LkVF5sM,184500,188310,That Intel had their own reduced instructions set CPU
LFQ3LkVF5sM,188310,190800,called the I860 and I960.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,190800,192000,And you'd be kidding yourself
LFQ3LkVF5sM,192000,193980,if you thought that they weren't prototyping stuff
LFQ3LkVF5sM,193980,194909,on the side.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,194910,196590,Like Apple was when they were suffering
LFQ3LkVF5sM,196590,199497,through 14 nm ++++.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,199497,201360,"A change in the PC industry would,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,201360,202193,"of course,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,202193,203025,have a teething period
LFQ3LkVF5sM,203026,205080,like Apple Silicon is currently experiencing.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,205080,208110,But it could eventually be a good thing.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,208110,209970,And not just for efficiency.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,209970,210803,Think about it.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,210803,214439,Intel and AMD are alone in the CPU race right now.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,214440,215610,Just like AMD and NVIDIA
LFQ3LkVF5sM,215610,218370,are currently alone in the GPU race.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,218370,220349,"And if Intel had their way,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,220350,222540,in the '90s or in 2015.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,222540,224370,There'd be only one.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,224370,226680,Thanks to Intel's control over performance
LFQ3LkVF5sM,226680,228390,and efficiency enhancing extensions.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,228390,231477,Used on modern CPUs like SSE and AVX.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,231477,234060,And AMDs control over the 64 bit extensions
LFQ3LkVF5sM,234060,236010,that every desktop CPU
LFQ3LkVF5sM,236010,237239,since core two has used.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,237240,240180,We don't have any other desktop CPU manufacturers.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,240180,242129,Anyone entering the x86 market
LFQ3LkVF5sM,242130,243690,would have to reverse engineer
LFQ3LkVF5sM,243690,245340,those extensions to compete.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,245340,248160,Because AMD and Intel have a technology sharing agreement
LFQ3LkVF5sM,248160,249960,that forbids sub licensing.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,249960,252960,And expires if either company changes hands.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,252960,253950,"By contrast,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,253950,256200,Arm doesn't sell anything directly.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,256200,258269,They develop the base specifications
LFQ3LkVF5sM,258269,260280,and then they license that to other companies.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,260280,261959,Who then have the option of tweaking
LFQ3LkVF5sM,261959,263190,and adding to those designs
LFQ3LkVF5sM,263190,264900,to tailor them to suit their needs.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,264900,267540,This is how Apple Silicon came to be.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,267540,269370,And if Arm took off on the desktop.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,269370,271620,We could see not only mobile players
LFQ3LkVF5sM,271620,273570,"like Qualcomm, Samsung"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,273570,275010,and MediaTek enter the ring.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,275010,277200,But maybe Google or even HP.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,277200,279420,They used to make their own CPUs once too.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,279420,280950,"And we can't forget NVIDIA,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,280950,283050,"whose last consumer Arm SoC,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,283050,285509,uses GPU cores from 2014.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,285510,287250,And lives on in the Nintendo Switch
LFQ3LkVF5sM,287250,288960,and Shield TV+.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,288960,291060,Actually it's kind of bizarre
LFQ3LkVF5sM,291060,292740,that NVIDIA hasn't continued
LFQ3LkVF5sM,292740,294720,to produce consumer SoCs.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,294720,297000,"Like perhaps contractual obligations,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,297000,299190,"within and outside of NVIDIA's control,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,299190,300240,had something to do with it.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,300240,301949,Because not only were they close
LFQ3LkVF5sM,301950,303900,to straight up buying Arm.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,303900,305880,A sign that they knew times were changing.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,305880,309720,But they're also still actively developing Arm SoC's.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,309720,311130,Just not for consumers.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,311130,314100,"Their Grace data center SoC for AI acceleration,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,314100,316380,has a surprisingly similar level of integration
LFQ3LkVF5sM,316380,317760,to Apple Silicon on paper.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,317760,320220,And it's just begging to be scaled down
LFQ3LkVF5sM,320220,321690,so that consumers can use it.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,321690,322830,Just like the Teslas
LFQ3LkVF5sM,322830,325710,and not Quadro GPU's do with GeForce.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,325710,327720,But let's back up a sec.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,327720,329160,Duopoly aside.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,329160,331410,If x86 is so bad
LFQ3LkVF5sM,331410,333000,and Arm is so good.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,333000,336330,Why is x86 still the king of the PC?
LFQ3LkVF5sM,336330,338879,"Well, prior to Apple Silicon."
LFQ3LkVF5sM,338880,342540,You'd be forgiven for thinking that Arm chips
LFQ3LkVF5sM,342540,344340,simply can't perform.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,344340,346410,"Like Intel and AMD,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,346410,348870,Qualcomm has a virtual monopoly
LFQ3LkVF5sM,348870,351000,over non Apple Arm PCs.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,351000,352440,And a literal monopoly
LFQ3LkVF5sM,352440,354000,in the Windows ecosystem.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,354000,356550,Thanks to an exclusivity agreement with Microsoft.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,356550,357780,"When that deal was pinned,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,357780,359850,it probably did make some sense.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,359850,361950,Qualcomm was the third biggest chip maker
LFQ3LkVF5sM,361950,364020,even as of mid 2020.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,364020,365430,And they're still a giant
LFQ3LkVF5sM,365430,367440,who's recently been eyeing a slice
LFQ3LkVF5sM,367440,369480,of the Arm pie for themselves.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,369480,371520,So assuming Qualcomm would become
LFQ3LkVF5sM,371520,374129,the biggest supplier of desktop Arm chips.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,374130,375480,It made sense for Microsoft
LFQ3LkVF5sM,375480,377610,to want to optimize for that hardware.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,377610,380069,"Unfortunately, for Microsoft and for us."
LFQ3LkVF5sM,380070,382050,There's no polite way to put this.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,382050,384599,Even Qualcomm's latest chips suck.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,384600,386160,Which recently prompted Google
LFQ3LkVF5sM,386160,387750,to follow Samsung and Apple
LFQ3LkVF5sM,387750,389580,in going their own way with Tensor.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,389580,391110,And may eventually prompt Microsoft
LFQ3LkVF5sM,391110,392219,to do the same.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,392220,394260,Qualcomms utter failure to compete
LFQ3LkVF5sM,394260,395670,"in the PC space, so far."
LFQ3LkVF5sM,395670,398580,"Has given Intel, AMD and especially NVIDIA"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,398580,399900,precious breathing room.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,399900,400800,And we're not saying
LFQ3LkVF5sM,400800,403020,that the PC as we know it is dead today.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,403020,405120,It definitely still has some life left.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,405120,407067,And they'll first probably try to integrate
LFQ3LkVF5sM,407067,409439,x86 SoC's more tightly
LFQ3LkVF5sM,409440,411030,before they consider switching over.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,411030,411990,"Intel for example,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,411990,413749,could very well be working on an SoC
LFQ3LkVF5sM,413749,416190,that combines Alder Lakes efficiency cores
LFQ3LkVF5sM,416190,418410,with a larger number of XE graphics cores
LFQ3LkVF5sM,418410,419400,and AI engine blocks.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,419400,420479,Taking the dye space
LFQ3LkVF5sM,420480,422010,that would otherwise have been allocated
LFQ3LkVF5sM,422010,423750,to the bigger performance cores.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,423750,424770,"Even so,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,424770,426569,reduced instruction set architectures
LFQ3LkVF5sM,426570,428640,proved their worth in the late '90s
LFQ3LkVF5sM,428640,429990,with early Arm licensees
LFQ3LkVF5sM,429990,431069,and with PowerPC.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,431070,433950,Which was famously used in the first iMac's.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,433950,434850,"Clock for clock,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,434850,437040,PowerPC tended to outperform x86
LFQ3LkVF5sM,437040,438090,by a wide margin.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,438090,439800,Though this did depend on the task.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,439800,441090,And eventually PowerPC
LFQ3LkVF5sM,441090,442650,hit a performance and efficiency wall.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,442650,444509,Just like x86 is today.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,444510,446310,"Intel's Itanium for its part,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,446310,448440,was supposed to be a sort of successor
LFQ3LkVF5sM,448440,449730,to risk as a concept.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,449730,451890,"By using what HP termed,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,451890,454320,Explicitly Parallel Instruction computing.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,454320,455670,Or Epic.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,455670,458310,"Yes, naming has always been bad."
LFQ3LkVF5sM,458310,460800,Unlike our swacket from lttstore.com
LFQ3LkVF5sM,460800,462720,It describes exactly what it is.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,462720,464550,A sweater and a jacket.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,464550,465419,"As we know today,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,465420,467970,Itanium didn't work out so well.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,467970,471300,Still even Intel saw that the x86's days were numbered.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,471300,472590,Their plan for Pentium 4
LFQ3LkVF5sM,472590,473580,was more or less
LFQ3LkVF5sM,473580,475560,to just clock it as high as it would go.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,475560,477540,And hope that the numbers kept going up.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,477540,479670,And now that we're back to this phase again.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,479670,481140,Where we can't physically fit
LFQ3LkVF5sM,481140,482430,more cores on a dye
LFQ3LkVF5sM,482430,483990,because new process nodes
LFQ3LkVF5sM,483990,485970,are providing less additional density.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,485970,487620,Something's got to give.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,487620,488580,"The current solution,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,488580,489689,stacking dyes.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,489690,491190,Will only get you so far
LFQ3LkVF5sM,491190,494250,when you're already pushing 241 watts.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,494250,495150,"By comparison,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,495150,496830,"a lot of Arms advantages today,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,496830,499409,come not strictly from its reduced instruction set.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,499410,500910,But from how it's typically bundled
LFQ3LkVF5sM,500910,502500,into a system on chip configuration.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,502500,504150,Where virtually the entire computer
LFQ3LkVF5sM,504150,506310,is super close to the CPU cores.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,506310,508830,Why does this matter when we already have APUS?
LFQ3LkVF5sM,508830,511110,Well it's all about density and power draw.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,511110,513269,Simply expanding the size of the dye.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,513270,515010,"Isn't normally a good idea,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,515010,517110,from a power and thermal perspective.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,517110,519360,But Arm cores are typically much smaller
LFQ3LkVF5sM,519360,521909,than x86 and sip far less power.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,521909,523199,So not only can you fit
LFQ3LkVF5sM,523200,525540,more of them into the same space.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,525540,526980,You're also not as limited
LFQ3LkVF5sM,526980,528990,in terms of dye size in general.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,528990,533430,M1 Ultra's dye area is bigger than the RTX 3090 Ti.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,533430,535020,Let's do a case study.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,535020,539130,AMD's 8 core Ryzen 7 5700G desktop APUS
LFQ3LkVF5sM,539130,541260,"are somewhere between an M1 and M1 Pro,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,541260,542490,in terms of dye size.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,542490,545070,The APU dedicates just over a quarter
LFQ3LkVF5sM,545070,546300,of the utilized dye space
LFQ3LkVF5sM,546300,548850,to CPU cores and cache alone.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,548850,550709,And just 10% to the GPU.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,550710,551640,"For thermal management,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,551640,554820,there's also a fair amount of unused white space
LFQ3LkVF5sM,554820,556530,even within the cores themselves.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,556530,559380,"Meanwhile, even M1's big performance CPU cores"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,559380,561150,are tiny by comparison.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,561150,563790,With all cores taking just over 20%
LFQ3LkVF5sM,563790,565889,of that smaller dye area.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,565890,569340,The GPU takes up double the relative dye space as the APU.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,569340,572520,Which means there's way more GPU horsepower on tap.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,572520,574800,And still room for other functions
LFQ3LkVF5sM,574800,576779,"like the massive media engine,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,576780,579060,neural engine and storage controller.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,579060,581250,There's very little white space by comparison.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,581250,583350,Not only are those Arm cores efficient enough
LFQ3LkVF5sM,583350,585149,to handle such a compact layout.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,585150,587130,But when so much of the system
LFQ3LkVF5sM,587130,588210,is contained within it.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,588210,589530,Significantly less energy
LFQ3LkVF5sM,589530,591030,has to be used for signaling.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,591030,593160,Which also happens to be much faster.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,593160,595230,If we tried to push an x86 processor
LFQ3LkVF5sM,595230,596220,to these densities.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,596220,599220,In proximity with this many GPU cores.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,599220,601709,It would quickly become a thermal meltdown event.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,601710,602760,Sort of like the opposite
LFQ3LkVF5sM,602760,604110,of how Alex had to save
LFQ3LkVF5sM,604110,606390,a frozen Core i9-12900KS.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,606390,607680,Literally frozen.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,607680,608760,Go check it out on Floatplane
LFQ3LkVF5sM,608760,609690,along with more exclusive
LFQ3LkVF5sM,609690,610710,when you're done here.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,610710,612180,And it scales.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,612180,616140,M1 Mac's sports a larger dye than the RTX 3070.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,616140,618690,And M1 Ultra is about a third again bigger
LFQ3LkVF5sM,618690,620880,than the RTX 3090 Ti.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,620880,622380,"With the dye that large,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,622380,624270,the compute-y bits to the 3090 Ti
LFQ3LkVF5sM,624270,625560,would take up roughly half
LFQ3LkVF5sM,625560,627300,the M1 Ultra's dye area.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,627300,628620,While Apple will currently dedicates
LFQ3LkVF5sM,628620,629970,just over a third.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,629970,631529,That means that if Apple built
LFQ3LkVF5sM,631530,633120,a dedicated big chip design.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,633120,635490,And weren't using their own Metal API
LFQ3LkVF5sM,635490,637080,separate from the rest of the industry.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,637080,638520,They legitimately could reach
LFQ3LkVF5sM,638520,639930,high end GPU levels
LFQ3LkVF5sM,639930,641790,of real world performance.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,641790,644339,Shame that Apple had to go their own way.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,644340,647700,But imagine if NVIDIA were to build such a thing.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,647700,649170,They could corner the Arm desktop
LFQ3LkVF5sM,649170,651029,or Notebook space very quickly.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,651030,652830,"If developers were on board, especially."
LFQ3LkVF5sM,652830,655650,"It's not as simple as gluing them together, obviously."
LFQ3LkVF5sM,655650,657660,And that GeForce power consumption
LFQ3LkVF5sM,657660,658709,is still a problem.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,658710,661140,But it's also not an impossible hurdle.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,661140,663030,"And with the success of Apple Silicon,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,663030,664980,despite its growing pains.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,664980,666360,It's impossible for the industry
LFQ3LkVF5sM,666360,667560,to ignore the advantages
LFQ3LkVF5sM,667560,668610,to this approach.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,668610,670320,You can have excellent performance
LFQ3LkVF5sM,670320,672240,coupled with incredibly low power draw.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,672240,673950,On a much more open architecture.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,673950,675510,That allows for bigger
LFQ3LkVF5sM,675510,677760,or more aspirational system integrators
LFQ3LkVF5sM,677760,679530,to tweak things as they see fit.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,679530,682320,This potential future will suck for enthusiasts
LFQ3LkVF5sM,682320,683880,who like getting their hands dirty.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,683880,686310,But the alternative is laid bare before us.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,686310,688620,Power targets shooting up at record pace
LFQ3LkVF5sM,688620,690600,to the point where we're looking at new connectors
LFQ3LkVF5sM,690600,692250,to help deliver all the juice.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,692250,694470,"This generation of hardware now,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,694470,697139,is already incredibly power hungry.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,697140,698790,With Intel and AMD squeezing
LFQ3LkVF5sM,698790,700170,higher and higher frequencies
LFQ3LkVF5sM,700170,701220,out of their cores.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,701220,704129,And NVIDIA rumored to require up to 600 watts
LFQ3LkVF5sM,704130,706500,for their next gen top end GPU.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,706500,708090,There's really no backing down.
LFQ3LkVF5sM,708090,709717,"We have to ask ourselves,"
LFQ3LkVF5sM,709717,710699,"""Is it worth it?"""
LFQ3LkVF5sM,710700,713730,And at what point does it stop being worth it?
LFQ3LkVF5sM,713730,715019,At least it's always worth listening
