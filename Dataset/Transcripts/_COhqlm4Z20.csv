_COhqlm4Z20,132319,134319,this is the wide screen so idea for the
_COhqlm4Z20,134319,137360,new phone ui or we can say design is
_COhqlm4Z20,137360,139360,going to be like this it will be a

_COhqlm4Z20,148480,150640,so as you can see so this is how it is
_COhqlm4Z20,150640,153440,going to be the new phone ui from the
_COhqlm4Z20,153440,155280,tech update so the phone screen will
_COhqlm4Z20,155280,158319,look like this or we will going to see
_COhqlm4Z20,158319,162239,this mode in the landscape as we can see
_COhqlm4Z20,162239,163200,like this
_COhqlm4Z20,163200,165280,so let me show you one by one what is
_COhqlm4Z20,165280,167599,going to be added so as we can see these
_COhqlm4Z20,167599,170000,are going to be the new option the phone
_COhqlm4Z20,170000,172319,is going to look like this and then we
_COhqlm4Z20,172319,174080,will start from the right so at upper
_COhqlm4Z20,174080,176400,side we can see there is the exit option
_COhqlm4Z20,176400,178239,if we click on the cross then it will
_COhqlm4Z20,178239,180000,exit then we will see
_COhqlm4Z20,180000,182720,there is a battery icon and at the left
_COhqlm4Z20,182720,184800,side we can see there is a back icon
_COhqlm4Z20,184800,186640,then you can see the network and then
_COhqlm4Z20,186640,189200,there is a wi-fi symbol
_COhqlm4Z20,189200,191440,and also we can see the day here it is
_COhqlm4Z20,191440,193519,written one and we can see it is
_COhqlm4Z20,193519,196159,afternoon morning or night and we can
_COhqlm4Z20,196159,198800,see the time and here we have four
_COhqlm4Z20,198800,200000,options
_COhqlm4Z20,200000,202480,uh first one is going to be the contact
_COhqlm4Z20,202480,205040,where we will see the contacts as new
_COhqlm4Z20,205040,207040,option is added over here context which
_COhqlm4Z20,207040,209040,is not accessible in the current version
_COhqlm4Z20,209040,211280,but from the tech update we will have a
_COhqlm4Z20,211280,213920,contact option and then we will have a
_COhqlm4Z20,213920,216000,personal option so this personal option
_COhqlm4Z20,216000,218640,is nothing but our stats we can see our
_COhqlm4Z20,218640,219599,stats
_COhqlm4Z20,219599,220480,in the
_COhqlm4Z20,220480,222400,current version same like that we can
_COhqlm4Z20,222400,224640,see here if you click on our personal

_COhqlm4Z20,228080,229840,and the third option is going to be the
_COhqlm4Z20,229840,232560,online banking option so i guess we can
_COhqlm4Z20,232560,235599,do online banking from our phone as we
_COhqlm4Z20,235599,238560,have a saga financial bank games i guess
_COhqlm4Z20,238560,240720,the option is for that and then we have
_COhqlm4Z20,240720,242480,this achievement option where we can
_COhqlm4Z20,242480,243599,check out
_COhqlm4Z20,243599,246319,which are completed and which are not so

_COhqlm4Z20,274320,276479,see there is a green color button

_COhqlm4Z20,391199,393199,there is story progress option as we can
_COhqlm4Z20,393199,396560,see so this bar is half filled so once

_COhqlm4Z20,432160,435280,have ram and rom options as we can see
_COhqlm4Z20,435280,437840,so these are also there and also we can
_COhqlm4Z20,437840,440400,see in front of the story progress bar
