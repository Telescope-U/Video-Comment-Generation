PIsgPIaVGQg,3840,6080,good thing is also bad

PIsgPIaVGQg,8480,11599,philippines wants to do the gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,11599,14559,treatment for its entire lineup well it
PIsgPIaVGQg,14559,17279,begs the question do we really need a
PIsgPIaVGQg,17279,20400,toyota rush gr sport

PIsgPIaVGQg,24160,27560,let's do this

PIsgPIaVGQg,101360,104479,gr sport to do this car feature if you
PIsgPIaVGQg,104479,106479,are within the area and you need any

PIsgPIaVGQg,111759,113280,inquiries you may also contact the
PIsgPIaVGQg,113280,116000,person in my pen comment below this
PIsgPIaVGQg,116000,118479,toyota rush gr sport now replaces the
PIsgPIaVGQg,118479,120799,rush g as the top of the line variant of
PIsgPIaVGQg,120799,123040,the rush here in the philippines and
PIsgPIaVGQg,123040,126159,with the added gr sport bits and pieces
PIsgPIaVGQg,126159,128879,while it also received a price bump
PIsgPIaVGQg,128879,131200,it now has a retail price of one million
PIsgPIaVGQg,131200,132480,one hundred seventy six thousand
PIsgPIaVGQg,132480,135040,philippine pesos which is seventy six
PIsgPIaVGQg,135040,138239,thousand pesos more expensive than the
PIsgPIaVGQg,138239,140720,rush g of yesteryear
PIsgPIaVGQg,140720,143120,however guys it does get some gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,143120,145440,bits and pieces here and there so we'll
PIsgPIaVGQg,145440,148959,see in my video if these uh gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,148959,151760,bits and pieces are enough to justify
PIsgPIaVGQg,151760,153920,that price increase
PIsgPIaVGQg,153920,156560,unfortunately the upgrades are few and
PIsgPIaVGQg,156560,158080,far in between
PIsgPIaVGQg,158080,160800,you see the front fascia of this rush gr
PIsgPIaVGQg,160800,163840,sport remains largely unchanged from the
PIsgPIaVGQg,163840,165040,rush g
PIsgPIaVGQg,165040,167920,save for the added cladding and bits
PIsgPIaVGQg,167920,170640,found on the front bumper now these
PIsgPIaVGQg,170640,173599,added cladding here gives the rush gr
PIsgPIaVGQg,173599,177200,sport a bulkier and meatier look
PIsgPIaVGQg,177200,179920,however guys aside from that well the
PIsgPIaVGQg,179920,181360,all the other bits
PIsgPIaVGQg,181360,183440,remain largely unchanged
PIsgPIaVGQg,183440,185680,the rush gr sports cell gets led
PIsgPIaVGQg,185680,188640,headlights here halogen fog lights and
PIsgPIaVGQg,188640,191200,the same rush front grille
PIsgPIaVGQg,191200,193280,i mean if you look closely at the grill
PIsgPIaVGQg,193280,196720,guys we don't even get a gr sport badge
PIsgPIaVGQg,196720,199760,on the front grille
PIsgPIaVGQg,199760,202480,here on the side the rust gr sport gets
PIsgPIaVGQg,202480,204640,an additional side garnish here at the
PIsgPIaVGQg,204640,207440,lower part of the doors which gives this
PIsgPIaVGQg,207440,208319,rush
PIsgPIaVGQg,208319,211120,that rugged flavor to make it look
PIsgPIaVGQg,211120,212879,sportier
PIsgPIaVGQg,212879,214400,and nope
PIsgPIaVGQg,214400,215840,sorry guys
PIsgPIaVGQg,215840,217760,it doesn't really do it for me
PIsgPIaVGQg,217760,220159,now see the thing is aside from that
PIsgPIaVGQg,220159,223519,side garnish well this side profile is
PIsgPIaVGQg,223519,226400,practically identical to the toyota rush
PIsgPIaVGQg,226400,227599,g
PIsgPIaVGQg,227599,230000,heck we don't even get the gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,230000,232480,badge on the front fender similar to the
PIsgPIaVGQg,232480,235920,ones found in the high lux gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,235920,238239,however guys well it's not all doom and
PIsgPIaVGQg,238239,241599,gloom here because this top spec rush gr
PIsgPIaVGQg,241599,244000,sport still gets power folding side
PIsgPIaVGQg,244000,246400,mirrors with led turn signals and we
PIsgPIaVGQg,246400,249439,still have these low profile blacked out
PIsgPIaVGQg,249439,252000,roof rails there and these gorgeous
PIsgPIaVGQg,252000,254799,17-inch alloy wheels wrapped in 60
PIsgPIaVGQg,254799,256400,series tires
PIsgPIaVGQg,256400,258320,now behind these wheels we get the same
PIsgPIaVGQg,258320,260479,mechanical bits found in the other rush
PIsgPIaVGQg,260479,263120,variants because we have ventilated disc
PIsgPIaVGQg,263120,265759,brakes up front and drum brakes at the
PIsgPIaVGQg,265759,266639,back
PIsgPIaVGQg,266639,268960,but for the suspension
PIsgPIaVGQg,268960,271919,well this rush gr sport still rides on a
PIsgPIaVGQg,271919,273840,ladder frame chassis
PIsgPIaVGQg,273840,276400,and that's paired with a mac person
PIsgPIaVGQg,276400,279280,front suspension and an axle type rear
PIsgPIaVGQg,279280,280800,suspension
PIsgPIaVGQg,280800,283040,now that tells me guys that this toyota
PIsgPIaVGQg,283040,286240,rush including this gr sport trim is
PIsgPIaVGQg,286240,288960,really meant for carrying heavy loads
PIsgPIaVGQg,288960,291120,and it's also meant for some off-road
PIsgPIaVGQg,291120,294000,purposes because the ground clearance
PIsgPIaVGQg,294000,296639,stands at 220 millimeters
PIsgPIaVGQg,296639,299840,which is a pretty tall for a small suv
PIsgPIaVGQg,299840,302160,and it's also pretty similar to the
PIsgPIaVGQg,302160,304960,other rush variants
PIsgPIaVGQg,304960,307600,the rear end of the toyota rush gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,307600,311360,may look identical to the rush g variant
PIsgPIaVGQg,311360,314560,but thankfully guys we now get a gr
PIsgPIaVGQg,314560,317440,sport badge right here and we also have
PIsgPIaVGQg,317440,320000,a rear bumper that has been given the gr
PIsgPIaVGQg,320000,321759,sport treatment
PIsgPIaVGQg,321759,324400,now when you pop open the manual lift
PIsgPIaVGQg,324400,326080,gate of this thing
PIsgPIaVGQg,326080,327680,you'll notice that the toyota rush gear
PIsgPIaVGQg,327680,330080,sport gets the same cargo capacity
PIsgPIaVGQg,330080,332800,that's found in the other rush variants
PIsgPIaVGQg,332800,335440,with a third row in use it still gives
PIsgPIaVGQg,335440,338960,back around 213 liters of cargo space
PIsgPIaVGQg,338960,341840,which is good enough for as you can see
PIsgPIaVGQg,341840,344479,a medium-sized luggage here plus maybe a
PIsgPIaVGQg,344479,347039,small backpack beside it
PIsgPIaVGQg,347039,349840,now guys if you need more space than 213
PIsgPIaVGQg,349840,353520,liters well the the third row seats can
PIsgPIaVGQg,353520,355680,tumble forward as you can see
PIsgPIaVGQg,355680,358160,and once you tumble it forward it will
PIsgPIaVGQg,358160,361759,now give you over 500 liters of cargo
PIsgPIaVGQg,361759,362960,space
PIsgPIaVGQg,362960,364639,which is good enough to
PIsgPIaVGQg,364639,368080,fit in one two three
PIsgPIaVGQg,368080,371280,four and five around five medium-sized
PIsgPIaVGQg,371280,372560,luggage
PIsgPIaVGQg,372560,374720,now in case you're wondering guys well
PIsgPIaVGQg,374720,377199,the spare tire can also be found
PIsgPIaVGQg,377199,381840,underneath the toyota rush gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,382560,385600,one of my issues with the local gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,385600,388880,models is the fact that they're mostly
PIsgPIaVGQg,388880,389840,show
PIsgPIaVGQg,389840,391600,without any goal
PIsgPIaVGQg,391600,393840,unfortunately guys well the same can be
PIsgPIaVGQg,393840,396800,applied for this toyota rush gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,396800,399680,you see it gets the same engine found in
PIsgPIaVGQg,399680,402800,the base trim toyota rush e which is a
PIsgPIaVGQg,402800,406080,1.5 liter four-cylinder gasoline motor
PIsgPIaVGQg,406080,408720,that's only good for 102 horsepower and
PIsgPIaVGQg,408720,411680,134 newton meters of torque
PIsgPIaVGQg,411680,413759,however guys the good news here is well
PIsgPIaVGQg,413759,416479,it sends power to the rear wheels
PIsgPIaVGQg,416479,419840,via a very dependable four-speed
PIsgPIaVGQg,419840,420840,automatic
PIsgPIaVGQg,420840,423039,transmission now the fact that the
PIsgPIaVGQg,423039,425520,toyota rush is a rear-wheel drive
PIsgPIaVGQg,425520,428720,platform with a ladder frame chassis
PIsgPIaVGQg,428720,432240,is probably the only reason why toyota
PIsgPIaVGQg,432240,434800,still maintains the rush in the lineup
PIsgPIaVGQg,434800,438000,because it is a highly capable mini or
PIsgPIaVGQg,438000,441360,small suv that can haul heavier loads
PIsgPIaVGQg,441360,444000,than let's say the all-new toyota avanza
PIsgPIaVGQg,444000,449080,or even the all-new toyota velos
PIsgPIaVGQg,450400,452639,hop inside the cabin of the toyota rush
PIsgPIaVGQg,452639,455280,gr sport and you are treated to a cabin
PIsgPIaVGQg,455280,456319,that is
PIsgPIaVGQg,456319,460720,exactly identical to the rush g variant
PIsgPIaVGQg,460720,463360,i mean we don't get any gr-specific bits
PIsgPIaVGQg,463360,465440,and pieces here and i was kind of
PIsgPIaVGQg,465440,468160,disappointed to see that even the front
PIsgPIaVGQg,468160,471680,seats are just your regular rush seats
PIsgPIaVGQg,471680,474560,we don't get those gr sport seats with
PIsgPIaVGQg,474560,478080,those full leather trimming with cantara
PIsgPIaVGQg,478080,480000,and the you know and the gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,480000,481680,badging on the headdress
PIsgPIaVGQg,481680,483599,we don't get that here
PIsgPIaVGQg,483599,486400,heck we don't even get the gr sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,486400,488639,engine push start button right there
PIsgPIaVGQg,488639,489360,and
PIsgPIaVGQg,489360,490560,no guys
PIsgPIaVGQg,490560,493280,don't even ask about toyota safety sense
PIsgPIaVGQg,493280,495599,you see the rush gr sport doesn't get
PIsgPIaVGQg,495599,497840,toyota safety sense and as you can see
PIsgPIaVGQg,497840,500639,on your screen it gets the exact same
PIsgPIaVGQg,500639,504400,safety bits found in the rush g
PIsgPIaVGQg,504400,507360,now guys the only upgrade found here
PIsgPIaVGQg,507360,509520,well upgrade found here is the
PIsgPIaVGQg,509520,512560,infotainment system because while it has
PIsgPIaVGQg,512560,514719,the same size touchscreen there i
PIsgPIaVGQg,514719,516880,believe this is around seven inches
PIsgPIaVGQg,516880,519279,well it does come with apple carplay and
PIsgPIaVGQg,519279,521518,android auto now
PIsgPIaVGQg,521518,523039,the thing is
PIsgPIaVGQg,523039,525279,what toyota giveth
PIsgPIaVGQg,525279,527920,toyota shall take us away
PIsgPIaVGQg,527920,531200,because this rush gr sport also comes
PIsgPIaVGQg,531200,534000,with a reverse camera but unlike the
PIsgPIaVGQg,534000,537360,rush g variant well the reverse camera
PIsgPIaVGQg,537360,540720,image of this rush gr sport does not get
PIsgPIaVGQg,540720,542160,any reverse
PIsgPIaVGQg,542160,543680,guidelines
PIsgPIaVGQg,543680,545920,you see the rush g trim used to have
PIsgPIaVGQg,545920,548320,reversing guidelines but well we don't
PIsgPIaVGQg,548320,550000,get that here
PIsgPIaVGQg,550000,552480,so yeah it's a it's a bit of a give and
PIsgPIaVGQg,552480,555040,take or give or take
PIsgPIaVGQg,555040,557040,now other than that guys as i said the
PIsgPIaVGQg,557040,559760,entire cabin remains exactly similar or
PIsgPIaVGQg,559760,563120,identical to the rush g which means that
PIsgPIaVGQg,563120,566160,we get the signature toyota hard
PIsgPIaVGQg,566160,569040,plastics on the dashboard
PIsgPIaVGQg,569040,571440,the middle dashboard is also well it's
PIsgPIaVGQg,571440,573519,in off-white with some faux stitching
PIsgPIaVGQg,573519,576880,but it's also hard plastic see and even
PIsgPIaVGQg,576880,579680,the door cards here are hard plastics
PIsgPIaVGQg,579680,581360,and even the elbow rests on the door
PIsgPIaVGQg,581360,582959,cards are
PIsgPIaVGQg,582959,584560,not even padded i mean these are just
PIsgPIaVGQg,584560,586160,hard plastics
PIsgPIaVGQg,586160,588399,now thankfully guys we do get a leather
PIsgPIaVGQg,588399,590240,wrapped steering wheel here and the
PIsgPIaVGQg,590240,592880,steering wheel also adjusts for tilt
PIsgPIaVGQg,592880,595040,but it doesn't really telescope guys so
PIsgPIaVGQg,595040,597760,a bit of a bummer there and we have the
PIsgPIaVGQg,597760,600399,same fully automatic climate control
PIsgPIaVGQg,600399,602560,setup here which is good
PIsgPIaVGQg,602560,605440,but we also just have a manual handbrake
PIsgPIaVGQg,605440,607440,and if you'll notice we don't get a
PIsgPIaVGQg,607440,609120,center armrest
PIsgPIaVGQg,609120,611519,i mean i i i don't know what's what's
PIsgPIaVGQg,611519,614240,with that toyota i mean you gave the
PIsgPIaVGQg,614240,617519,all-new toyota avanza a center armrest
PIsgPIaVGQg,617519,620720,even the base spec avanza e gets a
PIsgPIaVGQg,620720,622160,center armrest
PIsgPIaVGQg,622160,624720,but this top-of-the-line toyota rash gr
PIsgPIaVGQg,624720,625920,sport
PIsgPIaVGQg,625920,628399,doesn't have a center armrest
PIsgPIaVGQg,628399,630560,i mean instead of a center armors we get
PIsgPIaVGQg,630560,633839,three small cup holders here which fails
PIsgPIaVGQg,633839,636720,my 600 ml clean canteen test
PIsgPIaVGQg,636720,638560,as you're seeing now yeah it doesn't fit
PIsgPIaVGQg,638560,640480,my 600 ml clean canteen so yeah it's a
PIsgPIaVGQg,640480,642480,bit on the small side so it would have
PIsgPIaVGQg,642480,643839,been better
PIsgPIaVGQg,643839,646399,if you just gave the toyota rush jr
PIsgPIaVGQg,646399,650560,sport a center armrest and call it a day
PIsgPIaVGQg,650560,651760,now guys
PIsgPIaVGQg,651760,654000,the fact that this cabin is practically
PIsgPIaVGQg,654000,656240,identical to the rush g
PIsgPIaVGQg,656240,659120,and we don't get any gr sport specific
PIsgPIaVGQg,659120,661360,bits and pieces here
PIsgPIaVGQg,661360,662959,kinda leaves
PIsgPIaVGQg,662959,666630,a bitter taste in my mouth
PIsgPIaVGQg,666630,669830,[Applause]
PIsgPIaVGQg,669920,672480,if we didn't get any major changes or
PIsgPIaVGQg,672480,674959,upgrades in the front part of the cabin
PIsgPIaVGQg,674959,677600,then don't expect to get any changes at
PIsgPIaVGQg,677600,680160,all here on the second row or even the
PIsgPIaVGQg,680160,681519,third row
PIsgPIaVGQg,681519,684240,you see it's the exact same layout as
PIsgPIaVGQg,684240,686560,the other rush variants here in the
PIsgPIaVGQg,686560,688800,country which means that we get a row of
PIsgPIaVGQg,688800,690880,ac vents here on the ceiling with some
PIsgPIaVGQg,690880,693279,blower controls there pretty similar to
PIsgPIaVGQg,693279,695839,a typical mpv although
PIsgPIaVGQg,695839,697680,most people out there will argue that
PIsgPIaVGQg,697680,700320,the rush is not an mpv but rather a
PIsgPIaVGQg,700320,703680,small suv and yeah i tend to agree with
PIsgPIaVGQg,703680,705600,you guys so don't worry about it but
PIsgPIaVGQg,705600,706480,well
PIsgPIaVGQg,706480,708480,the aircon layout is still pretty
PIsgPIaVGQg,708480,710480,similar to an mpv
PIsgPIaVGQg,710480,712399,now in terms of the absolute space here
PIsgPIaVGQg,712399,716320,well as expected from a small suv it's a
PIsgPIaVGQg,716320,719279,bit on the tight side guys so even for
PIsgPIaVGQg,719279,721680,someone like me who's five foot six well
PIsgPIaVGQg,721680,724320,i only get around the five inches of
PIsgPIaVGQg,724320,726240,knee room here and this is my driving
PIsgPIaVGQg,726240,729360,position and the headroom is around five
PIsgPIaVGQg,729360,731360,five and a half inches so it's not
PIsgPIaVGQg,731360,734320,really the most stellar uh yeah cabin
PIsgPIaVGQg,734320,736399,space in the category
PIsgPIaVGQg,736399,738800,now i also noticed that the seats also
PIsgPIaVGQg,738800,740880,doesn't provide that much of a thigh
PIsgPIaVGQg,740880,743360,support here and the seats are a bit on
PIsgPIaVGQg,743360,746079,the small side guys a bit on the narrow
PIsgPIaVGQg,746079,748800,side so if somebody like me who's just a
PIsgPIaVGQg,748800,751920,five foot six dude can feel that and
PIsgPIaVGQg,751920,753920,then imagine if you're a six footer
PIsgPIaVGQg,753920,756399,who's sitting here inside the rush yeah
PIsgPIaVGQg,756399,758639,it's going to be it's not going to be
PIsgPIaVGQg,758639,761200,the most comfortable uh
PIsgPIaVGQg,761200,763600,vehicle to ride in
PIsgPIaVGQg,763600,766639,now guys uh as for the third row seats
PIsgPIaVGQg,766639,769440,well they're pretty
PIsgPIaVGQg,769440,773360,useful for small kids or let's say for
PIsgPIaVGQg,773360,775440,it's best really for people or your
PIsgPIaVGQg,775440,777200,so-called friends
PIsgPIaVGQg,777200,780720,who you would like to torture
PIsgPIaVGQg,781200,783360,unlike the other gr sport models in
PIsgPIaVGQg,783360,786000,toyota's local lineup this toyota rush
PIsgPIaVGQg,786000,789440,gr sport felt a little bit underwhelming
PIsgPIaVGQg,789440,792079,you see that added 76 000 philippine
PIsgPIaVGQg,792079,794880,peso price bump only gave this thing
PIsgPIaVGQg,794880,797760,some exterior bits and trimmings plus
PIsgPIaVGQg,797760,800240,apple carplay and android auto which in
PIsgPIaVGQg,800240,803680,my opinion is not enough to justify that
PIsgPIaVGQg,803680,805360,price increase
PIsgPIaVGQg,805360,807360,heck guys they could have given us a
PIsgPIaVGQg,807360,811839,center armrest and maybe i'd be happier
PIsgPIaVGQg,811839,813839,you see if you're looking for a toyota
PIsgPIaVGQg,813839,816639,vehicle that can haul heavy loads

PIsgPIaVGQg,818880,821040,spec toyota rush e

PIsgPIaVGQg,823040,825920,family vehicle then the all-new toyota
