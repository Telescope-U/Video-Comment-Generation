19cMjxBeq28,61280,68000,good morning my darlings welcome to a  new vlog this is probably the scariest  i've ever looked at starting a vlog so
19cMjxBeq28,68000,74000,please forgive my appearance i make it  free and post pilates um
19cMjxBeq28,74000,79840,really really good oh my battery's about  to die and i didn't bring his phone with  me great pilates class this morning just
19cMjxBeq28,79840,86880,had a wonderful little look around  dalesford they have finally got their  seedlings in so i've got chard i've got
19cMjxBeq28,86880,93119,brussels sprouts i've got tomatoes and  i've bought  some lovely blooms and some goodies for
19cMjxBeq28,93119,98479,a friend that i'm meeting  now at the farmhouse i've also picked up
19cMjxBeq28,98479,104880,some incredible tips from the gardening  team here they are always so willing to  share loads of tips with me
19cMjxBeq28,104880,111040,i love quizzing people at every  opportunity so because my battery's  about to die i will share the tips when
19cMjxBeq28,111040,116719,i'm putting them into action later um  but my gosh it is the most glorious  morning i feel like i'm talking 100
19cMjxBeq28,116719,122000,miles an hour because my camera's going  to cut out any second  um but yes a beautiful day here in the
19cMjxBeq28,122000,128959,cotswolds i'm heading to the farmhouse  for a couple of hours to do some work  have lunch with my friend um and then an
19cMjxBeq28,128959,135840,afternoon of work and gardening so  yeah let's go  hello again my darlings i'm sorry that
19cMjxBeq28,135840,141280,was such a rushed um start to the vlog i  was trying to beat my camera battery
19cMjxBeq28,141280,147280,dying but  i spent pretty much the entire day at  soho farmhouse it was actually the most
19cMjxBeq28,147280,152560,glorious day got a little bit of work  done uh had a lovely swim with m for
19cMjxBeq28,152560,158800,most of the time we had the pool to  ourselves so we were just swimming along  breaststroke side by side
19cMjxBeq28,158800,165200,that sounds a bit weird  um i'm having a good old ketchup while  we swam which was great and then had a
19cMjxBeq28,165200,171760,lovely lunch  back home now i'm going to show you the  bits that i purchased at dalesford my
19cMjxBeq28,171760,177680,seedlings and i'm going to go out  and plant them in a second but first of
19cMjxBeq28,177680,183519,all i'm going to decide what i'm going  to make is for dinner because it is my  my turn to cook tonight and i'm trying
19cMjxBeq28,183519,189360,something  new when kat our photographer was here  she was raving about her hello fresh
19cMjxBeq28,189360,195519,meals and i thought you know what  actually that would be so convenient for  us because firstly i'm not the most
19cMjxBeq28,195519,201200,confident of cooks you will have seen in  my vlogs that charlie is very much the  cook in this household but i do want to
19cMjxBeq28,201200,207599,make more of an effort to cook at least  one evening meal here at the house um  but at the same time we do live half an
19cMjxBeq28,207599,215040,hour away from our nearest supermarket  so the fact that everything comes in one  box and cat was saying that the recipes  are literally mouthwateringly delicious
19cMjxBeq28,215040,220319,she is a very busy mom so if she says  that easy and delicious i trust her so
19cMjxBeq28,220319,226480,kat you have fully influenced this and i  thought i would share the process with  you guys and hellofresh have also shared
19cMjxBeq28,226480,231840,an amazing discount code with me which  i'll leave all the details for on the  screen here so i'm gonna look through
19cMjxBeq28,231840,238319,the recipes now and decide what i'm  going to make i think i've got three  main meals to choose from
19cMjxBeq28,238319,244000,there were so many i think like over 30  recipes that i could have chosen from on
19cMjxBeq28,244000,250000,their website but these three were the  most mouth-watering so i'll decide that  and then go and do a tiny bit of
19cMjxBeq28,250000,255439,gardening while the sun is still out as  you might be able to tell from my  glowing complexion it is a warm day
19cMjxBeq28,255439,261359,today it's a gorgeous day today and then  um charlie has been listening to his
19cMjxBeq28,261359,266960,sport podcasts and an advert keeps  playing for a film on sky cinema called
19cMjxBeq28,266960,274080,last seen alive  and the advert in the podcast sounds  amazing it's got gerald butler in it who
19cMjxBeq28,274080,282720,i actually am obsessed with and i  weirdly think that dexter reminds me of  him like if gerard butler was a dog
19cMjxBeq28,282720,289600,or if dexter was an actor  i don't know i just feel like they have  the same soul like they're both rugged
19cMjxBeq28,289600,296400,and handsome  anyway  that's what we both decided that we are
19cMjxBeq28,296400,302320,going to watch tonight on sky cinemas  we're gonna have a little bit of a movie  night um but yeah anyway let's look at
19cMjxBeq28,302320,308400,these recipes so we have got some  delicious ones to choose from i chose  all of these on the website
19cMjxBeq28,308400,314320,i'm kind of leaning towards this one  this is one of the eat me early ones uh  one of their classic dishes we've got a
19cMjxBeq28,314320,319759,rapid dish here apparently only 20  minutes  speedy chicken noodles that looks and
19cMjxBeq28,319759,326800,sounds mouth-watering or teriyaki sesame  sesame chicken you can tell what kind of  mood i was in when i chose these recipes
19cMjxBeq28,326800,332479,and then we've got some snacks as well  but i think we've got friends coming  over tomorrow night so i think that  would be amazing to do when we've got
19cMjxBeq28,332479,338080,friends here i think i'm gonna do  um  this one
19cMjxBeq28,338080,343360,so that could take me 25 to 30 minutes i  always give myself a bit of extra time
19cMjxBeq28,343360,350560,so if i spend 30 minutes in the garden  and then start prepping this should be  perfect  timing wise
19cMjxBeq28,350560,357039,look at this gorgeous afternoon  it is has been such a beautiful day
19cMjxBeq28,357039,363039,today not too hot  just perfect i would say i've been  working out here on the table
19cMjxBeq28,363039,369120,so oh i've got a call at 6 30. oh my  gosh in seven minutes do you like my  screensaver by the way
19cMjxBeq28,369120,376720,look at my handsome boy  he's so lovely so i'll quickly show you  what i purchased at dalesford
19cMjxBeq28,376720,383840,i'm so happy to see that they have got  all of their seedlings again this year i  don't know why i thought they'd have  been there sooner but um yeah they have
19cMjxBeq28,383840,391199,them again which is amazing and i found  them so good last year if any of your  seedlings failed or if you didn't um
19cMjxBeq28,391199,397039,you know if you just didn't have the  capability to grow them this year then  dalesford have got you covered so
19cMjxBeq28,397039,403280,because i didn't have a greenhouse um  literally on the month countdown i  couldn't start any tomatoes this year
19cMjxBeq28,403280,409199,which is a shame i guess i could have  done them from the house but never mind  so we have got a few different types of
19cMjxBeq28,409199,415039,tomatoes this is  gardener's delight and that was two  pound fifty so i thought that was pretty  good
19cMjxBeq28,415039,421280,obviously you can get an entire seed  packet for two pound fifty but  you know someone has cared for this and
19cMjxBeq28,421280,427199,grown it so i think that's pretty good  value these obviously need planting and  staking i think this might also be a
19cMjxBeq28,427199,432800,gardener's delight oh no this is a  gold goldiana a couple of different
19cMjxBeq28,432800,439599,types of tomato i had these in the car  while i was at the farmhouse and the  whole car smelled so divine afterwards
19cMjxBeq28,439599,445039,literally like the del's ford fine  tomato candle  um and then this is also a gardener's
19cMjxBeq28,445039,450960,delight this one's on a bit of a wonk so  they very much need staking and with  tomatoes you can
19cMjxBeq28,450960,456880,remove these lower shoots  because it's only these upper ones kind  of what he called them
19cMjxBeq28,456880,463120,and actually produce the tomatoes and  when i plant it i'll probably bury it up  to about here
19cMjxBeq28,463120,468560,and then i also picked up oh that needs  some water
19cMjxBeq28,468560,474639,some charred rainbow chard which is  going to be amazing  when this properly grows because my
19cMjxBeq28,474639,480319,rainbow child seedlings just did not do  very well this year i think i may have  done them too early
19cMjxBeq28,480319,486240,um it's always a bit hit and miss and  then i thought how fun  to grow my own brussels sprouts for
19cMjxBeq28,486240,492240,christmas dinner  so yeah looking forward to  planting all of that up um which i will
19cMjxBeq28,492240,499120,do  after my phone call in a second right  i've brought my seedlings down to the  garden and i need to carefully think
19cMjxBeq28,499120,504960,about where  i'm going to put each of these the  tomatoes need something to climb up so
19cMjxBeq28,504960,511039,i'm wondering about this obelisk here  although i do currently  have some beans on it
19cMjxBeq28,511039,518080,um let's see if anything i mean there's  a few flowers which does mean hopefully  that there should be some beans growing
19cMjxBeq28,518080,523839,but  maybe  um  actually i think these might do okay
19cMjxBeq28,523839,530880,i'll give them a feed later on um so  perhaps i should do a structure in this  little gap here that the tomatoes can
19cMjxBeq28,530880,537040,grow up actually this is literally me  thinking out loud tomatoes do love  sunshine
19cMjxBeq28,537040,542080,uh so maybe something on this bed  instead and the chard could go in that
19cMjxBeq28,542080,547600,little slot  over there  yes i think i'll do the chard in that
19cMjxBeq28,547600,553200,slot over there  the tip that i mentioned earlier about
19cMjxBeq28,553200,558399,preventing my peas and my moisture from  getting eaten alive and very excitingly
19cMjxBeq28,558399,565279,where is it i do have here it is my very  first  mojo i will eat that and savor every
19cMjxBeq28,565279,571120,mouthful because at the moment it's my  only one um  i definitely need to try a lot harder to
19cMjxBeq28,571120,576560,protect my laundry two next year but i  need to spend some time down here  tomorrow and really tidy it up and get
19cMjxBeq28,576560,582800,everything  stringed in and protected but the tip is
19cMjxBeq28,582800,590640,to use  black cotton  as like a grid around your peas and  monge 2 because then it's invisible to
19cMjxBeq28,590640,596480,pigeons um and then they fly down they  either touch it with their legs or their  wings they don't know what it is because
19cMjxBeq28,596480,603279,they didn't see it and then they fly  away and they won't try again because  they get a little bit scared it's  normally only when the plants are small
19cMjxBeq28,603279,611260,but as you can see a lot of mine have  been nibbled so i think i need to thin  out the nibbled beyond repair
19cMjxBeq28,611260,617839,[Music]  and protect that  my kale that i left uncaged completely
19cMjxBeq28,617839,623920,nibbled  and then i just need to think  where i'm going to grow my sprouts these
19cMjxBeq28,623920,629680,will grow into little trees and if  you've ever seen sprouts growing i'll  pop a picture in here
19cMjxBeq28,629680,634959,so maybe they could go  next to my beans  i'm gonna have to do some googling and
19cMjxBeq28,634959,640640,see what sprouts like being next to but  that'll keep me busy tomorrow but for  now i'm actually too hungry
19cMjxBeq28,640640,646640,to do this so i'm gonna head inside and  make  my dinner okay so here we have all of my
19cMjxBeq28,646640,654000,ingredients so we're in the little paper  bag for recipe  number one which is what i'm going to  try tonight i love the fact that
19cMjxBeq28,654000,660640,everything is already proportioned like  i i don't even know if you can buy one  shallot by itself so hopefully this
19cMjxBeq28,660640,666800,means less waste less things  that we forget about or don't end up  using in the cupboard um i can't wait
19cMjxBeq28,666800,673279,until i can grow my own courgettes but  mine are not ready yet so we've got some  courgettes a lime we've got some rice
19cMjxBeq28,673279,679519,some cherry plum tomatoes the spices  again  otherwise i would just i'd have to buy
19cMjxBeq28,679519,685839,an entire jar of these spices and that  would never get used and then we've got  some
19cMjxBeq28,685839,692160,chicken breast ready to go  so  oh i love that it's a photo photo
19cMjxBeq28,692160,697519,instructions always so much easier  your fruit and veg may need a little  wash before you start tells me what i'm
19cMjxBeq28,697519,702880,going to need tool wise and apparently i  can do this in 25 25-30 minutes so
19cMjxBeq28,702880,711749,let's go  [Music]
19cMjxBeq28,714420,717500,[Music]
19cMjxBeq28,721670,726730,[Music]
19cMjxBeq28,728720,731720,so
19cMjxBeq28,734190,745440,[Music]
19cMjxBeq28,745440,750480,sorry i have not spoken through any of  the recipe creating so far but i'm
19cMjxBeq28,750480,755519,filming i'm concentrating on cooking and  i'm not very good at multitasking um but
19cMjxBeq28,755519,761600,i'm about to get to the last stage now  so far i've probably only been busying  away in the kitchen for 15 minutes and
19cMjxBeq28,761600,766720,so many of the steps  and the time is actually just waiting  for the chicken to get brown or waiting
19cMjxBeq28,766720,773839,for the onions to soften so i've already  done the washing up which is amazing  amazing especially as we love a tidy
19cMjxBeq28,773839,779839,kitchen so the step that i didn't film  that i just did was adding the zest of  the lime into the rice i just had a
19cMjxBeq28,779839,785360,little taste test and  makes so much difference i feel like  these little tips i just would never
19cMjxBeq28,785360,791920,have done and now that i've learnt it  through my hello fresh instructions i  will do it for future rice recipes as
19cMjxBeq28,791920,797839,well which is fabulous it's been very  easy and it's smelling amazing even  charlie said the smell is making his
19cMjxBeq28,797839,805839,mouth water so that is great news so the  discount code that hellofresh have given  me is hello josie50 and i'll get you 50
19cMjxBeq28,805839,811040,of your first box and 35 off your next  three boxes which is incredible so i'll
19cMjxBeq28,811040,819040,leave it linked down below and now i  think my chicken curry is probably just  about ready so it's time to plate up
19cMjxBeq28,821600,826639,i have literally never known a meal in  this household to be completed with the
19cMjxBeq28,826639,833839,right amount of rice  i  whether it's charlie or me cooking we  always always always always without fail
19cMjxBeq28,833839,839519,every single time cook too much rice but  this is the perfect amount there's one
19cMjxBeq28,839519,845680,thing that kat said she was like it's so  good for less food wastage um and she's  right i looked at the sachet and i was
19cMjxBeq28,845680,852070,like that is not gonna be enough rice  for charlie and i but  perfect
19cMjxBeq28,852070,857839,[Music]
19cMjxBeq28,857839,863199,well my darlings i'm not gonna lie this  looks and smells  absolutely
19cMjxBeq28,863199,868240,delicious and  it's still gorgeously light and warm  outside so we're gonna sit and have our
19cMjxBeq28,868240,874560,dinner  overlooking the sunset oh my gosh it  smells absolutely delicious and that
19cMjxBeq28,874560,880399,probably took me from start to finish  about  realistically with all the chopping
19cMjxBeq28,880399,888320,just under 30 minutes hello again  darlings oh my goodness that was  delicious i'm so full i'm so full that i
19cMjxBeq28,888320,894639,could literally go straight to bed in  fact i think we are going to go straight  to bed and watch our film but
19cMjxBeq28,894639,902560,charlie was very proud of me for cooking  that in only half an hour as well and  minimal tidying up minimal um washing up
19cMjxBeq28,902560,908000,afterwards so perfect perfect for a  weeknight dinner i'm really excited to  do the next ones as well because i think
19cMjxBeq28,908000,914480,they will all just be absolutely  delicious so that's going to become a  regular a regular um dinner solution in
19cMjxBeq28,914480,920399,our household now so i'm going to take  my makeup off and we are going to get  straight into bed and watch our film i'm
19cMjxBeq28,920399,927760,really looking forward to watching it i  the little audio clips i've heard on  charlie's podcast sound amazing um it's
19cMjxBeq28,927760,935279,actually a sky  exclusive so sky release  it was something mad like one film an
19cMjxBeq28,935279,942079,exclusive new film a week just the most  insane amount of films and this is the  one that really piqued our interest so i
19cMjxBeq28,942079,947199,believe gerald butler his wife goes  missing from a gas station
19cMjxBeq28,947199,952480,so obviously set in america a petrol  station um and then it's him being all  handsome trying to find her so we're
19cMjxBeq28,952480,958320,going to watch that this evening and i  will report back on my thoughts on the
19cMjxBeq28,958320,964320,film tomorrow morning good night  good morning my darlings it is ten to

19cMjxBeq28,1102000,1109840,bed obviously it's super easy to watch  sky on any of our devices tvs downstairs  or tablets laptops but yeah fantastic
19cMjxBeq28,1109840,1115360,film um if you like  crime obviously um if you like gerald
19cMjxBeq28,1115360,1121039,butler  if you like i don't know if i'd call it  yeah maybe it's a thriller as well but
19cMjxBeq28,1121039,1128000,it's the kind of film that okay the kind  of tv programs that i like are so we  loved the split we loved
19cMjxBeq28,1128000,1133120,we love line of duty we love silent  witness you know those kind of things if
19cMjxBeq28,1133120,1138240,that's your kind of tv then last seen  alive will be your kind of film it's one
19cMjxBeq28,1138240,1144160,of those films where so often you're  screaming at the tv like don't do that  or get back in the car um but yeah
19cMjxBeq28,1144160,1149280,charlie and i really really enjoyed it i  kind of wish it was longer actually i  feel like there were obviously some
19cMjxBeq28,1149280,1155760,twists in the film which i won't spoil  for you but i felt like  i wanted more so maybe they're leading
19cMjxBeq28,1155760,1162240,on to what you call it when there's  another film afterwards a sequel maybe  they're leading on to a sequel but yeah
19cMjxBeq28,1162240,1168240,great film highly recommend i'm gonna  leave the trailer for it linked down  below so you can check it out if you
19cMjxBeq28,1168240,1174799,would like to but yeah it's a glorious  day i think having this um  glass roof
19cMjxBeq28,1174799,1180720,makes a lot of difference to me because  the defender when you're inside it is  really dark and i think because my
19cMjxBeq28,1180720,1185919,interiors in this car are lighter and  i've got the ceiling light i think i  feel more bathed in light when i'm
19cMjxBeq28,1185919,1191039,driving which makes my driving  experience so much more fun so to be  honest the errands i'm doing this
19cMjxBeq28,1191039,1196480,morning are like not urgent errands but  i just kind of wanted to get out and  have a drive i just wanted to
19cMjxBeq28,1196480,1202720,toodle around the lanes because as you  guys know i find this area so beautiful  and i love just i love enjoying the
19cMjxBeq28,1202720,1209360,countryside so that's what i'm gonna do  um but i will catch up with you guys  again when  i get home i love that i drive in
19cMjxBeq28,1209360,1214880,electric so  it's just amazing it's so quiet so if
19cMjxBeq28,1214880,1220720,i'm  except for my sensor telling them about  hitting the wall um yeah it's just such
19cMjxBeq28,1220720,1226320,a smooth  and usually silent drive it's going to  go off again now
19cMjxBeq28,1231760,1238000,such a silent drive and just like that  i'm home from my morning's errands and i
19cMjxBeq28,1238000,1244640,have arrived back home  to find this beautiful bunch on our  doorstep i can actually smell them even
19cMjxBeq28,1244640,1250559,from this far away these are a lovely  gift and delivery from our wonderful
19cMjxBeq28,1250559,1256000,neighbor friend and gardener jack  cotswold country bird the cotswold
19cMjxBeq28,1256000,1263360,country bed on instagram oh my gosh they  smell  they smell just  heavenly what a lovely treat i think
19cMjxBeq28,1263360,1269440,these ones which have the lilac around  the edge but are mostly white i think  they're the jubilee ones um which i did
19cMjxBeq28,1269440,1275360,plant a few of so hopefully  some of mine will come through  and then we've got the deep purples
19cMjxBeq28,1275360,1281600,beautiful soft pinks  absolutely stunning so i'm going to add  a little bit more water to the vars
19cMjxBeq28,1281600,1287919,and make up some pretty displays  well seeing as this vlog has ended up  being quite a foodie one i'll show you
19cMjxBeq28,1287919,1294240,again what's in my morning smoothie i  have showed you this a few times so i  apologize for the repetition although
19cMjxBeq28,1294240,1299440,i'm not sure that i've really shown you  these before this is my new favorite  thing to add into my morning smoothie
19cMjxBeq28,1299440,1305679,whenever i go to for example dalesford  or if i'm out and about in london and i  see somewhere that does smoothies with
19cMjxBeq28,1305679,1311360,acai berry and i always get them and i  love the flavor in fact it's making my  mouth water
19cMjxBeq28,1311360,1318720,so i get these sachets from amazon and i  absolutely sorry not amazon um ocado and
19cMjxBeq28,1318720,1325360,i i'll leave the exact ones linked down  below definitely worth adding it to your  ocado order and then sometimes i add in
19cMjxBeq28,1325360,1330480,a few more berries as well if we've got  them i'll just go and check if there's  any strawberries in the garden
19cMjxBeq28,1330480,1337280,tigernut milk almond or peanut butter  oats a scoop of a kind of powder and a
19cMjxBeq28,1337280,1341960,banana  delicious
19cMjxBeq28,1344030,1359589,[Music]
19cMjxBeq28,1359679,1366480,so it's just gone 1pm i'm taking a  little lunch break from my  morning of work
19cMjxBeq28,1366480,1372240,and i'm doing a little bit of the  gardening that i needed to do so i've  got my sweet peas now tied in i'm going
19cMjxBeq28,1372240,1377440,to give them a bit of a feed actually  i'm not very good at feeding and that's  probably why i've not got many things
19cMjxBeq28,1377440,1383440,flowering yet um definitely need to get  better at that and then i've tried to  tie in some of my mulch too and then i'm
19cMjxBeq28,1383440,1388799,going to try to create the cotton  cage area so they don't get nibbled
19cMjxBeq28,1388799,1394799,again probably gonna pull up the kale  that got eaten alive and then  i might
19cMjxBeq28,1394799,1401360,attempt to do a little bit of manual  pollinating of my courgettes where you  take a little brush and you essentially
19cMjxBeq28,1401360,1406880,do the bee's job for him because i think  all of my bees are preoccupied by the  salvia up there
19cMjxBeq28,1406880,1412000,and essentially take the pollen from the  female flower and brush it onto the male
19cMjxBeq28,1412000,1417440,flower i also need to sort out my  maypole  because my beams are too strong for the
19cMjxBeq28,1417440,1424400,string  so it has got a little bit
19cMjxBeq28,1424400,1429760,tangled and i need to re-thread them  it's definitely too warm to do any
19cMjxBeq28,1429760,1436559,watering  to do any proper watering now but i  think i'll give my seedlings a little  bit of a water and then i'll do a proper
19cMjxBeq28,1436559,1442880,watering once it starts to cool down a  bit later i've just come over to tie up  my broad beans and i have seen that
19cMjxBeq28,1442880,1447919,we've got the first few pods down here i  forgot that they grow upwards i think
19cMjxBeq28,1447919,1454320,i've just got these two one here  and one here i might even be able to  pick this one in a couple of days which
19cMjxBeq28,1454320,1459840,will be very exciting my first broad  bean um harvest of the year however
19cMjxBeq28,1459840,1465520,i don't know if they got dehydrated or  if this was an aphid attack but loads of
19cMjxBeq28,1465520,1470799,them i'd love to know if any of you guys  have any advice i mean that could  develop into a bean pod but loads of
19cMjxBeq28,1470799,1477600,them just look like charred it does look  like there's some pods developing  um and there is some aphid action in
19cMjxBeq28,1477600,1483360,there so i might  do a little bit of the old natural fairy  liquid remedy on these later
19cMjxBeq28,1483360,1488799,because it was so satisfying eating all  of the broad beans last year gosh i need
19cMjxBeq28,1488799,1496080,to pick this spinach  my goodness this is ginormous  right and before it gets totally dried
19cMjxBeq28,1496080,1501160,out  i am also going to plant my chard
19cMjxBeq28,1501160,1517830,[Music]

19cMjxBeq28,1581039,1588720,so yeah five minutes until the live  start i always get slightly nervous just  before going live you never know
19cMjxBeq28,1588720,1595279,what's gonna happen you can't cut and  edit um but jade is so lovely we always  have so much to chat about so i might
19cMjxBeq28,1595279,1601279,just leave you guys  rolling somewhere um and maybe share a  few little behind-the-scenes sniffers
19cMjxBeq28,1601279,1608000,and guess who forgot to press record on  this camera we've just done the live we  chatted for 30 minutes loads of you
19cMjxBeq28,1608000,1614640,tuned in which was really really lovely  lots of questions about where jade got  her inspiration from the book i
19cMjxBeq28,1614640,1621279,obviously don't want to give too much  away but what i did say on the live was  that the book  okay i'm only halfway through so i can't
19cMjxBeq28,1621279,1627039,wait to go back and lie in the sun and  maybe finish it but at least get through  a few more chapters this afternoon we're
19cMjxBeq28,1627039,1632720,essentially following lovely lucille as  she basically her granny sends her on a
19cMjxBeq28,1632720,1638640,treasure hunt to paris to find this dior  dress and through finding this to your  dress turns out there are other dior
19cMjxBeq28,1638640,1645440,dresses in this magical collection and  we're also finding out about a love  story that happened in the 1950s in
19cMjxBeq28,1645440,1651440,paris it's a really lovely read i  started it in barcelona hopefully going  to finish it this afternoon i'll leave a  link down below to where you can
19cMjxBeq28,1651440,1658799,purchase it  but yes so lovely to have 30 minutes of  jade's time  on publication day one exciting day that
19cMjxBeq28,1658799,1664000,must be um but yeah it was a great live  thank you if any of you guys joined um
19cMjxBeq28,1664000,1670000,and  i'm gonna head back out into the sun and  hopefully finish a few more chapters so
19cMjxBeq28,1670000,1675520,i've come downstairs back to the office  charlie's section of the office is in  full sun
19cMjxBeq28,1675520,1680960,mine will very much be in the shade but  i am going to spend half an hour reading  a little bit more of the book because
19cMjxBeq28,1680960,1687760,jade dangled a few carrots and i am  intrigued to find out what is coming  soon while i was busy chatting to jade
19cMjxBeq28,1687760,1693840,charlie has been setting up our new  parasol which we bought from the east  london parasol company it's got these
19cMjxBeq28,1693840,1701039,cute little polka dots underneath and  scalloped edges really really sweet and  it's the i think the old one was from
19cMjxBeq28,1701039,1707120,wayfair a couple of years ago and we'll  use it down in the bottom  uh garden but we just wanted something a
19cMjxBeq28,1707120,1713520,little bit more beautiful for up here  the quality of this is absolutely  exceptional it's a gorgeous wooden frame
19cMjxBeq28,1713520,1720000,and then we chose this uh stone kind of  base my battery's about to go um it was  a little bit of a nightmare unpackaging
19cMjxBeq28,1720000,1727039,it it came in a wooden box which charlie  had prize open  put together with nails um but never
19cMjxBeq28,1727039,1732240,mind it's up now and it looks absolutely  gorgeous  is there a puppy dog down here oh dexy
19cMjxBeq28,1732240,1737520,you've got half of your bottom on the  bed and half on the floor  where's the logic in this my sweet
19cMjxBeq28,1737520,1744159,elongated friend  you're so silly so i've done a couple of  hours of emails and now going to head
19cMjxBeq28,1744159,1750159,down into the garden again this has  become a gardening vlog as they all do i  placed an order i'm actually really
19cMjxBeq28,1750159,1756960,impressed with how quickly these arrived  i placed an order just two days ago with  vital seeds and i have to say i think
19cMjxBeq28,1756960,1763520,they are my favorite seed company i like  their branding they always have quite  unusual style um
19cMjxBeq28,1763520,1770559,veggies sometimes if you just go to the  usual places garden centers you get  quite boring veg but they have really
19cMjxBeq28,1770559,1776399,interesting varieties on vital seeds and  i've always found them to perform really  well they always germinate really well
19cMjxBeq28,1776399,1781600,um  so i got a selection of different  radishes because i find radishes very
19cMjxBeq28,1781600,1787600,satisfying i am going to build a little  bit of a framework to hopefully  stop my second set of radishes getting
19cMjxBeq28,1787600,1793840,eaten by pigeons um some new autumn  cropping  carrots because i didn't do many carrot
19cMjxBeq28,1793840,1798880,seeds yet this year oh i bought brussels  sprouts hmm
19cMjxBeq28,1798880,1804720,oh do you know what you only are meant  to sow them march to april so they can  go for next year
19cMjxBeq28,1804720,1810000,and then spring onions i can do now  pak choy i have to wait until july so
19cMjxBeq28,1810000,1815919,that can wait a little bit longer  uh june and july for chicory i think  that'll be lovely
19cMjxBeq28,1815919,1821440,so yeah i've got a little bit of um  sewing to do i'm not sure if these need  to be done oh yeah you can sew them
19cMjxBeq28,1821440,1842320,direct perfect because  i'm feeling quite lazy  [Music]
19cMjxBeq28,1842320,1853460,do  [Music]
19cMjxBeq28,1854240,1860640,so i'm just taking a quick break from  gardening i say quick because tonight's  recipe apparently
19cMjxBeq28,1860640,1866159,is only going to take me 20 minutes we  shall see it is 20  well just under
19cMjxBeq28,1866159,1872320,well it's quarter to seven right now um  but i'm going to try and whip up as  quickly as possible because i want to
19cMjxBeq28,1872320,1879120,get back out into the garden the  teriyaki sesame chicken which sounds  delicious  quite similar to our meal last night but
19cMjxBeq28,1879120,1885919,different flavors so yeah let's go  even though i do have some veg in my
19cMjxBeq28,1885919,1891519,hellofresh box i thought it would be a  shame not to make the most of my first
19cMjxBeq28,1891519,1896960,real time of harvest in the kitchen  garden so i'm going to grab those little  marge 2
19cMjxBeq28,1896960,1904080,and  the broad beans  this is very exciting my first ever
19cMjxBeq28,1904080,1909679,monge 2 harvest see this is the perfect  size  for picking
19cMjxBeq28,1909679,1915320,oh there's actually quite a few  so camouflage
19cMjxBeq28,1931200,1938480,officially the smallest hardest ever but  it's very but it's a very satisfying one  because it's my first non-salad or
19cMjxBeq28,1938480,1944080,strawberry harvest  of the year it's like that dinner is  ready realistically that did take me
19cMjxBeq28,1944080,1949360,around 45 minutes but then i did have my  little trip into the kitchen garden and
19cMjxBeq28,1949360,1954640,i'm just a very slow cook and the kettle  i think it did and the kettle took a
19cMjxBeq28,1954640,1960799,long time to boil so i could definitely  have done it quicker um but it smells  delicious and it looks delicious
19cMjxBeq28,1960799,1984960,charlie's got a huge portion so  we're all happy  [Music]
19cMjxBeq28,1984960,1991360,i've just done my evening  i really can't call it flower arranging  sticking wild flowers in a vase and
19cMjxBeq28,1991360,1999200,hoping for the best it's a little bit  skewer if i need to rearrange the  daisies but i went for a green and white  color theme for this evening's bunch and
19cMjxBeq28,1999200,2005919,it goes really nicely here in our  bedroom i'm replacing these which have  been up here for a week i have to say
19cMjxBeq28,2005919,2011919,these flowers here do you see the ones  that look like little fireworks they are  about three weeks old now those stems
19cMjxBeq28,2011919,2017840,they were in my perennial millennial  bouquet from flowered um and they're  doing very well yeah i definitely need
19cMjxBeq28,2017840,2024640,to rearrange this it's always when i  carry it up the stairs the stems go a  little bit skewered  but it's still
19cMjxBeq28,2024640,2038400,rather wild and wonderful  [Music]
