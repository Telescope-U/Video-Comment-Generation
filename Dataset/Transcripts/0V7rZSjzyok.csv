0V7rZSjzyok,15360,22640,KTM Refines 1290 Super Duke GT for 2022. In  a segment that necessitates comfort and the  
0V7rZSjzyok,22640,30320,"ability to cover ground effortlessly, the KTM 1290  SUPER DUKE GT rewrites the rulebook. Designed to  "
0V7rZSjzyok,30320,36000,offer riders a unique Grand Touring experience but  engineered to be a true Sports bike underneath the  
0V7rZSjzyok,36000,43520,"touring parts, the KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE GT covers  ground unlike any Sports Tourer on the market.  "
0V7rZSjzyok,43520,55520,"Thanks to its EURO 5 rated, 175 HP, 141 Nm KTM  1290 SUPER DUKE R-derived, 1,301 cc V-twin engine,  "
0V7rZSjzyok,55520,60240,this is the class leader when it comes to punching  a hole in the atmosphere or hauling in the  
0V7rZSjzyok,60240,66880,horizon. But it’s not only forward momentum where  the long-distance BEAST is true to its namesake.  
0V7rZSjzyok,66880,75039,The WP APEX semi-active suspension on the KTM 1290  SUPER DUKE GT works with a specific logic. The  
0V7rZSjzyok,75040,80240,design approach to preload adjustability of the  rear shock has been geared for the long-distance  
0V7rZSjzyok,80240,86080,tourer and is very intuitive. The logic allows  riders to set the suspension up according to  
0V7rZSjzyok,86080,92480,"four different real-life riding situations,  namely: RIDER, RIDER & PILLION, RIDER & LUGGAGE,  "
0V7rZSjzyok,92480,99840,"or RIDER, PILLION & LUGGAGE. On top of that,  the anti-dive function is fitted as standard."
0V7rZSjzyok,117520,125360,HONDA NT1100 2022. Based on the Africa  Twin the NT1100 is unsurprisingly spacious

0V7rZSjzyok,130000,135040,and the seat is so comfy there’s neither a leg  stretch or bum-shuffle during our day’s riding  
0V7rZSjzyok,135040,140239,"at the Honda’s world launch near Barcelona.  We don’t have a friendly pillion on hand,  "
0V7rZSjzyok,140240,145520,"but their pegs are nice and low, too and  the 60mm back seat looks just as plush.  "
0V7rZSjzyok,146080,150880,"There’s plenty of weather protection, which  is handy in today’s rain and the lower wind  "
0V7rZSjzyok,150880,156880,deflectors do a great job to keep the spray off  your feet. You should also be able find one of

0V7rZSjzyok,162160,168240,(it pulls up and down by hand). Buffeting can also  be quite loud when it’s windy and if that puts you  
0V7rZSjzyok,168240,174320,"off, a more road bike-shaped tourer with a raked  screen will be much quieter. The left switchgear  "

0V7rZSjzyok,179760,186319,"gloves. Although the frame is the same as the  Africa Twin’s, the NT1100 has a new swing arm,  "
0V7rZSjzyok,186320,192320,slightly sportier steering geometry and shorter  travel suspension. It weighs a not insignificant  
0V7rZSjzyok,192320,200000,"248kg in DCT trim (the manual version is 10kg  lighter), but the Honda carries its weight  "
0V7rZSjzyok,200000,206320,"well. It’s stable at high speed and although  softly sprung, is nicely balanced in the bends,  "
0V7rZSjzyok,206320,211840,"nimble around town and when it’s time to stop,  low enough to get your feet flat on the floor. "

0V7rZSjzyok,448800,455280,run of success as a bang-for-the-buck sport-tourer  since its inception back in 2015. The Tracer is  
0V7rZSjzyok,455280,462000,"the direct descendant of the Tracer 900 GT, and  the FJ-09 before that, and it has always packed  "
0V7rZSjzyok,462000,468480,"a versatile punch. It’s a street-focused machine,  good for racking up triple-digit back road miles,  "

0V7rZSjzyok,529520,533840,and the wallet hit will likely wipe  out a portion of its trusted following.
