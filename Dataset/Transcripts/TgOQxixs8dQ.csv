TgOQxixs8dQ,259919,267199,hey what's going on everybody welcome  back to another awesome episode of red  tech live this is a special national
TgOQxixs8dQ,267199,273280,camera day hell yeah all right that's  awesome we're doing a great talk today  we're going to talk about building up
TgOQxixs8dQ,273280,281198,your v-raptor and i got johnny in here  with me escaped the uk  right better weather
TgOQxixs8dQ,281440,288000,and we got james as well how you doing  guys  all right so this is one i'm really
TgOQxixs8dQ,288000,293680,excited about as you can see we've got  this beautiful full cinema package right
TgOQxixs8dQ,293680,299680,here we actually just used this  yesterday on a test shoot and it's all  the way kitted up for all the things
TgOQxixs8dQ,299680,306400,that you want to do on a major set we've  got everything from wireless follow  focus our preston's on here we've got
TgOQxixs8dQ,306400,312720,an awesome sun hood that we got going on  pretty excited about that  but really it's all about this
TgOQxixs8dQ,312720,319600,production pack but this is the big guy  i think we should start  right at the the smaller one the smaller
TgOQxixs8dQ,319600,324880,production packs i think james has had  some some good insight on that yep so
TgOQxixs8dQ,324880,331120,what we're actually looking at here is a  my modified uh  this is basically the starter pack but
TgOQxixs8dQ,331120,338240,i've got some elements of the production  pack light and really i designed this or  i really have my my camera built in such
TgOQxixs8dQ,338240,344479,a way that with two screws this can  easily transition into another build or  anything else so we're going to actually
TgOQxixs8dQ,344479,349759,go through all of the items that come  and  in this production pack light you can
TgOQxixs8dQ,349759,357039,see we have our top handle here with our  run stop right there you can also see  that i've got my full size xlr adapter
TgOQxixs8dQ,357039,362880,here giving you two channels with  phantom power i can also stop the  recording and show you how we have our
TgOQxixs8dQ,362880,369759,nice integrated expander blade right  here on the bottom for both gen lock  time code control run stop and if we tip
TgOQxixs8dQ,369759,375759,this up on the bottom you can also see  the uh the bottom plate as well as our  anti-tip plate which is really nice when
TgOQxixs8dQ,375759,381440,i set this down i don't have to worry  about the camera falling off of the desk  here
TgOQxixs8dQ,381440,387680,and i also want to  show that it's just really nice that you  can go right into our quick release here
TgOQxixs8dQ,387680,394960,notice that i have a 15 millimeter rail  that i can easily transition right here  to my gdu
TgOQxixs8dQ,394960,400639,my gdu atlas handle and you can have  your  motor or nucleus going right here in the
TgOQxixs8dQ,400639,406319,front of the camera  and the other nice thing too with this  quick release is this is a
TgOQxixs8dQ,406319,412400,area on the bottom and you can see right  there we have our plate that i could  easily release notice that you hit the
TgOQxixs8dQ,412400,419440,button there on either side to release  that plate  and i can very easily transition that
TgOQxixs8dQ,419440,426080,to an airy style plate you can see that  and now my camera
TgOQxixs8dQ,426080,432479,can very easily transition to a shoulder  rig  so really nice to be able to have that  with both the
TgOQxixs8dQ,432479,438639,production pack light and the starter  pack  this is one of the things with how we've  designed all the accessories we've tried
TgOQxixs8dQ,438639,445280,to design it to be as flexible as  possible one of the things me and clay  were talking about earlier was that the  accessory package gives you the ability
TgOQxixs8dQ,445280,452800,to bolt on whatever you want to build  that package up and the starter pack  with the handle the xlr the the expander
TgOQxixs8dQ,452800,458479,blade will touch on a little bit later  it kind of lays that groundwork for you  to be able to build out and accessorize
TgOQxixs8dQ,458479,464080,it how you want because everyone rigs  their camera out differently we're going  to look at three of our rigs today using
TgOQxixs8dQ,464080,469840,fundamentally all the same accessories  but they're all going to be rigged out  very different shoots in a very
TgOQxixs8dQ,469840,476080,different way to me and clay i shoot  very differently and then clay you know  the one that is typically doing the  higher budget shoots of all of us kind
TgOQxixs8dQ,476080,481280,of has this camera rigged out like this  and that's kind of really where these  kind of come into their own so i think
TgOQxixs8dQ,481280,486800,we'll kind of move on to this production  pack accessory i i guess just work from  top to bottom and we were shooting with
TgOQxixs8dQ,486800,493759,this yesterday we had everyone you know  a typical crew ac all that kind of stuff  so you really can rig this camera up as
TgOQxixs8dQ,493759,501360,big or as small as you want yeah and  it's it's set up right now in a way that  i see on set all the time and and we're
TgOQxixs8dQ,501360,507120,really in a place where we've got all  the stuff  ready to go like so as we're stop
TgOQxixs8dQ,507120,513039,starting at the top here the handle  gives us amazing mounting points you can  see just how many different places we're
TgOQxixs8dQ,513039,519680,actually tying in and utilizing that  space you if we tip up here we can  really see
TgOQxixs8dQ,519680,525839,sorry wrong way but yeah as as you see  here we're getting all of this juice out  of these mounting points we've got our
TgOQxixs8dQ,525839,531760,little 15 mil rod here we had a preston  light ranger up there earlier it's just  a it was a little big for the setup
TgOQxixs8dQ,531760,537440,today i felt like it was blocking me and  johnny we want to be a part of the  stream too guys so uh
TgOQxixs8dQ,537440,543440,we're also  utilizing this uh the support right here  makes it so that this is all tied
TgOQxixs8dQ,543440,549680,together really really well and that all  leads in to our top play and our rmi um
TgOQxixs8dQ,549680,555680,so johnny why don't you talk to us um  audio that's just james can you hear us
TgOQxixs8dQ,555680,561440,yeah i can hear you guys just fine i i  maxed you all the way up and brought  myself down a little bit  okay that's just
TgOQxixs8dQ,561440,567360,check yeah sorry guys yeah yeah sorry  everyone fix the sound on the side  realize it was us that was not coming
TgOQxixs8dQ,567360,575959,through so we'll just wait for you guys  to confirm you can hear us  uh  i got you i can hear you
TgOQxixs8dQ,576000,582720,just check that the uh that the stream  can hear us quickly yep  yep sounds good sorry about that guys
TgOQxixs8dQ,582720,588880,i'll just i'll fill us in with some  space here well just in case nothing too  pertinent right just fun stuff
TgOQxixs8dQ,588880,595600,so that's always the way where you test  it beforehand everything works and then  you start going live and then
TgOQxixs8dQ,595600,602839,everything falls apart so that's right  i'm still quite quiet let's see if we  can yeah change
TgOQxixs8dQ,602839,608640,that test let's post that one up  oh
TgOQxixs8dQ,608640,615040,all right there we go  how are we doing with sound  we do apologize for that like johnny
TgOQxixs8dQ,615040,622800,said we did some testing but you know  you can test and test and test and  still stuff like this happens right
TgOQxixs8dQ,622959,628399,okay i think hopefully we've got that  now sorry okay  awesome back to the rig so i guess maybe
TgOQxixs8dQ,628399,634079,we didn't hear any of the start of that  so should we start at the top of the rig  yeah let's start at the top of the rig  again what we're looking at really what
TgOQxixs8dQ,634079,640880,i'm super excited about is just all the  amazing mounting points on the handle  we've got our 15 mil rod extension up
TgOQxixs8dQ,640880,647120,here that gives us an easy way to mount  things you can put the monitor up here  but we earlier we actually had a preston
TgOQxixs8dQ,647120,652320,light ranger up there as well we took it  off because we felt like it was blocking  us we wanted our screen there's actually
TgOQxixs8dQ,652320,657519,a really nice compact way to mount that  on because usually with a light ranger  you would have like a titan arm or
TgOQxixs8dQ,657519,662560,something on here but actually being  able to have it on like a really compact  point was quite nice obviously some
TgOQxixs8dQ,662560,667839,people will kind of mount the light  ranger a bit further forward but again  just having a nice 15 mil rod that you
TgOQxixs8dQ,667839,673040,can bolt in with some anti-twist points  is just really nice for even a  microphone if you want to have a
TgOQxixs8dQ,673040,679120,microphone up here on a little 15mm rod  or whatever you need it's just nice to  have that flexibility and and the parts
TgOQxixs8dQ,679120,685440,we're talking about with this top handle  are part of the extension pack so you  have the base handle which is this
TgOQxixs8dQ,685440,691519,little five inch piece along here and  then as clay will discuss in a moment  we've then got the wrap-around piece a
TgOQxixs8dQ,691519,698720,front one-inch piece that then allows  you to kind of configure it out there we  go that's exactly so now now you can
TgOQxixs8dQ,698720,705040,really see the full breadth of that  handle and as we see it extending down  the back here we get to operate off of
TgOQxixs8dQ,705040,710480,there but it also gives us all these  great mounts  to play with thing that you said that i
TgOQxixs8dQ,710480,717200,really keyed into and enjoyed is the  anti-twist so like that's something with  the handle as well having multiple
TgOQxixs8dQ,717200,722720,tie-in points it's very very secure it  feels easy to use and it gives us like i
TgOQxixs8dQ,722720,728480,said all these different mounting points  to get the accessories that everybody's  using on set and in a way that's really
TgOQxixs8dQ,728480,735040,easily accessible for acs and camera  operators i mean especially you know  with the operating people like to hold
TgOQxixs8dQ,735040,740240,on to the batteries and these kind of  things or if you've got an easy rig or  depending on if you've got a really
TgOQxixs8dQ,740240,746560,heavy setup here like you have with with  this primest lens take some of these  three inch or five inch pieces and put
TgOQxixs8dQ,746560,752240,them coming off the front because this  front part of the handle is still  completely modular so you can tack these
TgOQxixs8dQ,752240,757839,pieces onto the front if you've got a  really heavy setup and you really want  to counterbalance that a bit nicer so
TgOQxixs8dQ,757839,763519,again just having a modular handle is  really really nice and it ties it and  feels nice having a nice wood inlay
TgOQxixs8dQ,763519,768639,there a bit nicer than getting like a  warm or hot handle if you're on a hot  day especially yesterday we're shooting
TgOQxixs8dQ,768639,776000,degrees we're out outside 100 degrees  it's not getting sweaty it's not getting  weird like i really think that it's it's
TgOQxixs8dQ,776000,781839,a really easy handle to use and affords  you a lot of ease of use as well as
TgOQxixs8dQ,781839,788880,just functionality but below that the  the other things that we start to get  into are things like the plate and the
TgOQxixs8dQ,788880,795920,battery and the rmi so johnny why don't  you kind of walk us through a little bit  how how the plate attaches to the camera
TgOQxixs8dQ,795920,802240,awesome yeah so a top plate is is always  an important part to a camera it gives  you mounting points but with v-raptor we
TgOQxixs8dQ,802240,808800,wanted to do something a little bit  different and give you some more  functionality with the top plate so  hopefully if i can position this
TgOQxixs8dQ,808800,814480,just correctly and we get our  oh there we go there we are there we go
TgOQxixs8dQ,814480,821279,so hopefully you can see there we've  actually got these pogo pins on the if i  can get my orientation correct there we
TgOQxixs8dQ,821279,828079,go so there's some pogo pins on the very  top here and this will take power from  the battery adapter and you've got two
TgOQxixs8dQ,828079,834320,of these two pin lemos on the top here  so that's how we're powering our teradek  that's how we're powering our preston
TgOQxixs8dQ,834320,840560,we've then got dtap on the battery  there's a dtap on the battery adapter so  you've got loads of power inputs outputs
TgOQxixs8dQ,840560,846079,because you know on the camera natively  because it's so small we haven't got any  natively built in so having it in this
TgOQxixs8dQ,846079,852000,top plate was a really nice way to make  it really tight and kind of easy to  access there's also a little led light
TgOQxixs8dQ,852000,858000,here so if you're working in a really  dark situation uh you can illuminate the  side of the camera so you bolt the
TgOQxixs8dQ,858000,863920,battery plate if i get the battery plate  you can see that this has a couple of  little pogo pins on the back as well
TgOQxixs8dQ,863920,870079,there's some tie down points here as  well so it's a really rigid connection  you bolt it onto the back of the camera
TgOQxixs8dQ,870079,875199,screw it in and then you've got a really  solid system because one of the things  we found is that a lot of battery
TgOQxixs8dQ,875199,881839,adapters a lot of vlook adapters there's  sometimes a bit of wiggle and we didn't  want any of that in this system we  wanted it to feel like it's part of the
TgOQxixs8dQ,881839,886959,camera and that's really what this gives  you so then you're passing the power  through and you'll see actually on this
TgOQxixs8dQ,886959,893440,setup you know we wanted a bit of hot  swap so we've got a little shark fin  maybe on the other side actually we've
TgOQxixs8dQ,893440,899519,got a little shark fin here and then a  couple of just simple red volt micro v's  that you can just hot swap in there this
TgOQxixs8dQ,899519,905360,is one of the bebob adapters uh just to  give you again to build up to that  production kind of setup that people
TgOQxixs8dQ,905360,910399,want they want to be able to  take batteries off keep all their  accessories live and powered while
TgOQxixs8dQ,910399,917360,they're working with the camera yeah all  those little attentions to detail  our attention to details are things that
TgOQxixs8dQ,917360,924480,like really set this rig apart in my  opinion the little leds the fact that  things tie together to be really really
TgOQxixs8dQ,924480,931199,secure it does make it feel like this  camera becomes a slightly different  camera with this rig on it right it
TgOQxixs8dQ,931199,936800,becomes a really built to use on set  setup  i mean that's one of the things that
TgOQxixs8dQ,936800,942000,yesterday we had a camera set up like  this and then later on we're going to  show you the uh the gimbal setup that
TgOQxixs8dQ,942000,947920,clay was working with so literally you  can have the smallest possible package  but then the fullest cine package all
TgOQxixs8dQ,947920,953839,from one body as well and you know it's  all just you know relatively easy screws  to undo you know we were taking handles
TgOQxixs8dQ,953839,959120,off and things all day and configuring  it in different ways so it really is  very simple to do that and it was about
TgOQxixs8dQ,959120,965360,this small when you started right yes  exactly  when i when i walk around with that  production pack built up like you have
TgOQxixs8dQ,965360,971040,it there the common question i get asked  is oh is that the excel and no it's just
TgOQxixs8dQ,971279,977440,the stuff that you're looking for in the  excel and and and really i think that's  the flexibility one camera to build it
TgOQxixs8dQ,977440,982480,up one camera to make it smaller and  really what we're seeing here is the  best of both
TgOQxixs8dQ,982480,987920,exactly  then kind of so  uh moving down we've then got some some
TgOQxixs8dQ,987920,993759,side ribs so you can kind of see these  side ribs hopefully here on the front  they've actually screw into the top
TgOQxixs8dQ,993759,1000560,plate and onto the camera archer plate  uh if we spin that around this way like  that there we go so you can kind of see
TgOQxixs8dQ,1000560,1005680,here  we have  one rib here we've got a standard uh ari
TgOQxixs8dQ,1005680,1010959,style rosette a load of anti-twist  points on there and you can see it just  bolts in down here into the camera plate
TgOQxixs8dQ,1010959,1016800,so you've got a really rigid connection  on there onto the side of the camera and  again i mean from a more design
TgOQxixs8dQ,1016800,1022480,perspective you know having it flow  nicely into the body you know quite a  lot of accessories are just you know
TgOQxixs8dQ,1022480,1028079,squares of metal we wanted to try and  you know make it feel like it's part of  the camera system and blend really
TgOQxixs8dQ,1028079,1033199,nicely into that system and i can see  the production plates right there as  well johnny right you can see that right
TgOQxixs8dQ,1033199,1039038,there giving you extra reviews oh yeah  exactly so so  included in the production pack you get
TgOQxixs8dQ,1039038,1044240,these production plates and these  basically give you a little bit of  underside protection so yesterday we
TgOQxixs8dQ,1044240,1050000,were throwing this thing in and out of  cars and all this kind of stuff and just  having a bit of underside protection
TgOQxixs8dQ,1050000,1055120,because you know quite a lot of cameras  we've seen you know they get beat up you  know the underside of the camera really
TgOQxixs8dQ,1055120,1061200,gets chucked around so having a little  bit of protection there can be quite  nice of course and like johnny was  saying it's it's a hundred degrees
TgOQxixs8dQ,1061200,1066559,outside we're in the la river here it's  okay you've got the camera you need to  run to get something else you're gonna
TgOQxixs8dQ,1066559,1072240,set it on the ground it's a thing that  happens all the time right like we're  not we would love to all be doing best
TgOQxixs8dQ,1072240,1077840,practices all the time and have cushy  camera carts with us but sometimes when  you're running around on the fly even in
TgOQxixs8dQ,1077840,1083760,larger productions you need to make  things happen quickly and so things like  setting the camera on the ground they
TgOQxixs8dQ,1083760,1089440,happen and so when you put  little bits of extra kit in there to  help protect protect the longevity of
TgOQxixs8dQ,1089440,1096080,your equipment and really keep things  going strong i feel like it's really  beneficial to the overall flow on set
TgOQxixs8dQ,1096080,1103039,and speaking of extra bits of kit when  you're putting that together you might  notice there's an additional production  plate there's one for each side and it
TgOQxixs8dQ,1103039,1108559,and it fills that same space as the  expander blade so if you wonder why you  have an extra piece from your production
TgOQxixs8dQ,1108559,1115039,pack there are times when you might not  need the expander blade and that's what  that additional plate is so  just one point and that's exactly what
TgOQxixs8dQ,1115039,1120320,we have installed on this setup because  with a with a wireless follow focus  system you want to trigger the thing you
TgOQxixs8dQ,1120320,1126559,want to have time code maybe even gen  lock if you're doing virtual production  so the blade nicely tucks down here you
TgOQxixs8dQ,1126559,1133440,know it's it's not a big block that you  have to mount somewhere you know or  maybe with some of the uh mutiny i o
TgOQxixs8dQ,1133440,1139840,accessories when i have a really small  little module that mounts up here or  something again just giving you a  different option down here to mount and
TgOQxixs8dQ,1139840,1145840,trigger uh the uh the rs through here so  you've got just got the the preston rs  cable in here and then you've got a time
TgOQxixs8dQ,1145840,1151840,code control so if you wanted to have a  rcp2 accessory which we'll talk about a  little bit later on with ignite digi
TgOQxixs8dQ,1151840,1157520,there's some cool stuff coming there  just gives you that ability to break out  that ext port on the back of the camera
TgOQxixs8dQ,1157520,1163200,yep  super so what else have we got here and  i i think that another thing to kind of
TgOQxixs8dQ,1163200,1168400,point out here is that although the  quick release platform pack has 15 mil
TgOQxixs8dQ,1168400,1175039,lws as standard if you want to go to a  15 mil studio or 90 mil studio i think
TgOQxixs8dQ,1175039,1181679,james will uh will go to a shot of you  just to show this off on the very bottom  there's a qr quick release plate and
TgOQxixs8dQ,1181679,1189039,that basically gives you the correct  offset for you to mount on these 15 mil  studio or 90 mil studio plates very very
TgOQxixs8dQ,1189039,1194640,easily so james is just going to get  that up now um
TgOQxixs8dQ,1194960,1200480,so you can see right here  that this is the  right johnny that would be the uh the qr
TgOQxixs8dQ,1200480,1205840,plate that i think we showed last time  james it's that little square yeah yeah  that piece there so that basically gives
TgOQxixs8dQ,1205840,1211360,you your offset to be able to put on a  bp9 a bp8 or just a standard 19mm studio
TgOQxixs8dQ,1211360,1218480,plate that uses that harry standard so  very very nice that you can do that you  bolt it on the bottom and that's what  we've got here um with this primestar
TgOQxixs8dQ,1218480,1225760,lens we've got a a 50 mil studio plate  we've then got our 50 ml uh rods and  then a lens support for that as well so
TgOQxixs8dQ,1225760,1230799,again just giving you that flexibility  to configure the rig because 19 mil 15
TgOQxixs8dQ,1230799,1236240,mil 15 lws everyone rigs their camera  very differently depending on what  they're doing yeah that was one that's
TgOQxixs8dQ,1236240,1241360,one i've run into but sorry go ahead  james i was just going to say i leave i  leave this one on my sticks and then it
TgOQxixs8dQ,1241360,1246880,the the production pack comes with a  longer  plate as well and that's the one where  you can keep that
TgOQxixs8dQ,1246880,1252480,for balancing for heavier lenses but  it's really nice that it came with the  two plates
TgOQxixs8dQ,1252559,1258720,yeah that's all i had awesome so i think  with the rest of this kit you know  obviously we've uh we we've got some
TgOQxixs8dQ,1258720,1264159,rosette hand grips but you know any  standard uh rosette grips work those  kind of things i mean james this would
TgOQxixs8dQ,1264159,1269280,be a great place for you to start  showing off some of your your grips that  you've got on your rig you know gdu
TgOQxixs8dQ,1269280,1276320,grips there's just normal you know harry  style rosette grips that you can bolt on  yeah i actually um just while you guys
TgOQxixs8dQ,1276320,1282960,were showing off your kit um remember  how i mentioned i do everything with two  screws here so very quickly i was able
TgOQxixs8dQ,1282960,1289360,to switch  from the production handle right which  had my full-size xlr adapter and now i'm
TgOQxixs8dQ,1289360,1297360,going over to my gdu quantum top handle  that went in with two screws there and  notice i have our five pin to 3.5
TgOQxixs8dQ,1297360,1302559,adapter right here and so now i have  both the gdu handle that's lighter no
TgOQxixs8dQ,1302559,1307760,start stop but i have multiple mounting  points  i also have a rosette right over here on
TgOQxixs8dQ,1307760,1313520,my other  outrigger handle and what that allows me  to do is just very easily throw an evf
TgOQxixs8dQ,1313520,1319360,or an expanded cowboy handle or anything  else like that and i think i mentioned  it earlier you also have these
TgOQxixs8dQ,1319360,1325440,additional m4 screws here and i can  mount one right there or right there and  that would allow me to have another rail
TgOQxixs8dQ,1325440,1332000,system here on the upper architecture of  the camera really loving that  so i think speaking very nicely of of
TgOQxixs8dQ,1332000,1337679,mounting things like evs we thought you  know  clay set up clay likes operating with a
TgOQxixs8dQ,1337679,1343840,monitor out in front of him control the  camera a bit of a bigger view but people  do like using evfs so we've got a third
TgOQxixs8dQ,1343840,1349120,party evf here from astro design zacuto  portkeys all those other kind of evfs
TgOQxixs8dQ,1349120,1355520,with this gdu side plate that has a has  some nice rosette mounting points and  some arms that can come off you can
TgOQxixs8dQ,1355520,1361679,mount those very nicely  i tend to like operating just a bit more  lighter but you know still being able to
TgOQxixs8dQ,1361679,1367360,have the top plate and battery adapter  on the back with some gold mounts so  clay had v-lock on the back there but
TgOQxixs8dQ,1367360,1372400,i've got a nice gold mount on the back  here so you can choose which plates you  want to have on the back and that will
TgOQxixs8dQ,1372400,1379919,still attach to that top plate so very  easily i can then come up like to rest  the uh the battery on my shoulder uh
TgOQxixs8dQ,1379919,1386000,because gold mount feels a lot more  rigid in that sense you know there's no  worry of it a bit of it flying off which  i know that's why i would prefer gold
TgOQxixs8dQ,1386000,1391280,mount and just be able to have a setup  like this is really you know again just  having different ways of rigging the
TgOQxixs8dQ,1391280,1397200,camera totally and and i think a big  thing that i wanted to call out with all  of this talking about gold mount talking
TgOQxixs8dQ,1397200,1402240,about the accessories that we had on  that last rig is that part of the goal  or part of the the thing that you can do
TgOQxixs8dQ,1402240,1407520,that's amazing here is you can use stuff  that you already have right so you've  got gold mount batteries there's the
TgOQxixs8dQ,1407520,1412960,gold mount solution for you right if  you're running a preston okay now this  is the solution to mount that right
TgOQxixs8dQ,1412960,1419120,there's there's so many different  things within this setup that allow you  to take advantage of the kit that you
TgOQxixs8dQ,1419120,1425600,already have on hand  i think one thing here is all that we're  showing is having the monitor in  different places as well so i think this
TgOQxixs8dQ,1425600,1432320,is going to lead very nicely into clay's  um gimbal rig the the monitor comes as  standard with a 10 inch
TgOQxixs8dQ,1432320,1438559,usb type-c cable uh on on the rig we had  there we had an 18-inch cable uh we can
TgOQxixs8dQ,1438559,1445120,flip that around quickly just to kind of  show that off do a nice little  dance here but you can see my cable
TgOQxixs8dQ,1445120,1450480,coming out of the rmi right there  and that's going  down over here
TgOQxixs8dQ,1450480,1457840,and so that's that's a nice length right  i still have some room to move this  around if i want to but realistically
TgOQxixs8dQ,1457840,1464400,the glasses oh no that was glasses not  part of any camera  all right now as clay whipped that
TgOQxixs8dQ,1464400,1470799,around nothing wiggled and jiggled and  that was his glasses that fell off yeah  exactly  i'm more likely to break than that
TgOQxixs8dQ,1470799,1477360,camera rig is i'm pretty sure yeah and  just having those different length  cables 10 inch when on the camera 18
TgOQxixs8dQ,1477360,1482720,inch when still on the camera but having  to get it at the back of the camera  maybe off in front of the operator and
TgOQxixs8dQ,1482720,1487840,on this setup then a 39 inch cable where  you want to have the monitor still have
TgOQxixs8dQ,1487840,1493600,the control but be considerably further  away  from that setup yeah so unlike that last
TgOQxixs8dQ,1493600,1498960,rig which is nice and large but really  is benefited by people working with you
TgOQxixs8dQ,1498960,1505200,right so an ac  all those different things it's set up  with more crew  this is something that i use as a
TgOQxixs8dQ,1505200,1510240,one-man band all the time and for me  that's a really easy way to get things
TgOQxixs8dQ,1510240,1516480,done quickly when you don't have a lot  of extra hands on set and so that's why  i want this touch functionality on my
TgOQxixs8dQ,1516480,1523039,monitor i want to control all my  settings i want to do all that stuff  right in front of me really easily i'm
TgOQxixs8dQ,1523039,1528159,also rocking this ignite digi cage that  gives me that rmi availability right so
TgOQxixs8dQ,1528159,1533279,the top of the cage is cut out and then  we're we're mounting into the rmi here
TgOQxixs8dQ,1533279,1538480,and we're using uh their  bridge basically a riser that allows us
TgOQxixs8dQ,1538480,1543919,to get this ignite digi plate up on top  at a correct height for the rmi to clear
TgOQxixs8dQ,1543919,1549039,because also that's that's the key thing  here is in terms of balancing you want  to be able to move it forward and back
TgOQxixs8dQ,1549039,1555200,and if you didn't have this plate you'd  simply be you know either not being able  to use the rmr rmi or interfering with
TgOQxixs8dQ,1555200,1560720,it so that's really what allows you to  get that forward back exactly and  they've they've created a lot of really
TgOQxixs8dQ,1560720,1566559,amazing gimbal solutions over at ignite  digi and something that's not on here  right now but i got a chance to play
TgOQxixs8dQ,1566559,1575120,with it and i'm super excited to tell  you guys about is a translation box from  rcp1 and rcp2 meaning that as it stands
TgOQxixs8dQ,1575120,1581039,right now my mobipro can't communicate  with the camera through rcp or red  command protocol
TgOQxixs8dQ,1581039,1588640,that is the that's because the movi pro  is on rcp one and v-raptor's on rcp2 but
TgOQxixs8dQ,1588640,1595200,ignite digi made a box that'll translate  that for me which does a lot of great  things it allows me to use the mobi pro
TgOQxixs8dQ,1595200,1601520,controller and have start stop record  and change settings within there but it  also allows me to do something like my
TgOQxixs8dQ,1601520,1608080,latitude here which i could then run a  control cable to that translator and  have start stop record off of my finger
TgOQxixs8dQ,1608080,1614000,wheel right here which is something that  i gotta say since i switched to beer  after i've been missing it right so
TgOQxixs8dQ,1614000,1620320,reaching around to the front of your  gimbal rig touching the camera i mean i  think we all know anybody who operates  gimbal you don't want to touch the
TgOQxixs8dQ,1620320,1626799,payload you want to do that as little as  possible right preserve your motors and  also just to make sure that everything's
TgOQxixs8dQ,1626799,1632880,running clean it's it's a lot easier to  not be sticking your fingers in there  and playing around with the camera once
TgOQxixs8dQ,1632880,1639760,the motors are keeping it still so  something like a finger wheel that's  allowing you start stop record is hugely
TgOQxixs8dQ,1639760,1646240,beneficial as an operator and it's  something we were kind of missing  before on vraptor with its integration
TgOQxixs8dQ,1646240,1651520,on older pieces of kit which kind of  ties back into what i was saying before  which is that this is a camera that can
TgOQxixs8dQ,1651520,1657360,work with the equipment that you have on  hand as well which i think is a really  huge benefit because i don't want to buy
TgOQxixs8dQ,1657360,1662720,a new gimbal i'm not waiting for  somebody else to make a gimbal that's  specifically going to talk to my camera
TgOQxixs8dQ,1662720,1668880,i'm looking to solve the problems with  the equipment that i have and that i'm  used to using
TgOQxixs8dQ,1668880,1674640,exactly i mean are some other cool  things you've got on here as well you've  uh you've got their cage system as well  for bolting all that onto it and they've
TgOQxixs8dQ,1674640,1680720,got a few other nice little accessories  in there as well which is super cool yep  um  yeah totally agree that's that's kind of
TgOQxixs8dQ,1680720,1686320,what i was saying what i was pointing  out on this on this cage is  that  it does this gimbal work perfectly but
TgOQxixs8dQ,1686320,1691440,it also gives you some of the things  that if you want to pull this straight  off and put another rig together right
TgOQxixs8dQ,1691440,1697760,away it's very easy efficient and quick  to do you got rosettes on here you got  tons of mounting area and it gives you a
TgOQxixs8dQ,1697760,1704399,nice little raise off the bottom of the  camera sorry our top down is kind of  weird for the gimbal just because it's a
TgOQxixs8dQ,1704399,1710480,got a bunch of stuff in the way at the  top  but yeah you can kind of see now there's  here's our rosette over here
TgOQxixs8dQ,1710480,1718000,we've just got a bunch of different  mounting points on this ignite digi cage  that make operating a breeze
TgOQxixs8dQ,1718000,1724240,that's one of the things that thanks to  so many of our accessory partners that  literally any way that you want to work
TgOQxixs8dQ,1724240,1729520,you you can get that i mean one of the  accessories that i've been using a lot  recently has actually been this little
TgOQxixs8dQ,1729520,1736640,uh gdu kind of shoulder pad you know a  lot of people love operating getting as  opposed to on the shoulder in the chest
TgOQxixs8dQ,1736640,1742559,because these cameras are getting so  small that that your shoulder hasn't got  to be that the place taking the weight
TgOQxixs8dQ,1742559,1748320,yeah so having it you know compact a  little micro battery a uh a micro v
TgOQxixs8dQ,1748320,1755200,whatever you jammed into the shoulder  with some little stubby grips is super  cool and this is one of the things that  i saw years ago a lot of people asking
TgOQxixs8dQ,1755200,1760320,about you know when jared posts that  photo and now i'll be able to have  something like this i've loved being  able to do this you know i do quite a
TgOQxixs8dQ,1760320,1766480,lot of like mountain bike shooting that  kind of stuff getting in the in the  undergrowth having that kind of jammed  against me and kind of whipping that
TgOQxixs8dQ,1766480,1772960,camera around is really what i enjoy  about this  yeah no that the two handle setup like  james is about to show us right here is
TgOQxixs8dQ,1772960,1779039,what leads perfectly into that  and it's it's a very different shot a  mid-chest shot versus a shoulder shot
TgOQxixs8dQ,1779039,1785679,are going to have different looks and  one of the beauties with red and  pre-record i know ivan agherton's uh  famous first talking about this i can
TgOQxixs8dQ,1785679,1790799,have a conversation with you right here  an interview and do that one man band  interview and you're not looking at
TgOQxixs8dQ,1790799,1796799,you're looking directly at me right you  can get some of those really organic or  interviews and and you can get them to
TgOQxixs8dQ,1796799,1802399,come maybe drop some of their guard a  little bit yeah sort of like street  photography classics right like from
TgOQxixs8dQ,1802399,1808559,shooting from the hip from top down  viewfinders and things like that i  really like when we get to pull bits of
TgOQxixs8dQ,1808559,1814960,vintage shooting styles and things like  that into our current rigs it makes it  feel like a really holistic
TgOQxixs8dQ,1814960,1821279,sort of approach to this image making  it's it's fun it allows you to bring in  the legacy of where we came from but
TgOQxixs8dQ,1821279,1826480,utilize the best of modern technology to  do it  well then everyone again everyone has a
TgOQxixs8dQ,1826480,1833520,style your style of filmmaking we we own  the camera to inhibit your ability to  use your style you know if you're oh i
TgOQxixs8dQ,1833520,1838880,have to go on the shoulder because of  how this camera is rigged oh i have to  have handheld because of how how small
TgOQxixs8dQ,1838880,1844799,this camera is being able to get it onto  a shoulder like we showed on clay's  first rig or get it into a gimbal or as
TgOQxixs8dQ,1844799,1850559,small as clays as james is sorry that's  just what we wanted to do when designing  the accessories and i think actually
TgOQxixs8dQ,1850559,1856720,james you know moving again onto how  smoothly get the camera into some  underwater housings  talk about small
TgOQxixs8dQ,1856720,1862000,well and we talked about it when i when  i held up my rig earlier i want  everything to break down within two
TgOQxixs8dQ,1862000,1867760,screws two screws and i'm able to go  right into my dsmc3 salty water raptor
TgOQxixs8dQ,1867760,1873679,water housing the nice thing about water  housings are we typically swim out there  and i'm taking half of your controls and
TgOQxixs8dQ,1873679,1879200,i'm putting him behind your back and you  don't have access to them anymore that's  not the case this housing gives us full
TgOQxixs8dQ,1879200,1884320,access to the user interface i can have  my multiple uh presets right on here and
TgOQxixs8dQ,1884320,1890640,i'm gonna go ahead and show you just a  little bit of footage that i was able to  get last weekend here and what you're  gonna be seeing here is myself just
TgOQxixs8dQ,1890640,1896240,going right back into that salty water  housing notice that you can have  customized ports to go with your various
TgOQxixs8dQ,1896240,1903840,lenses here i'm shooting f8 f11 180  degree shutter with 8k 120 frames per
TgOQxixs8dQ,1903840,1909840,second and notice i can point that  directly into the sun or directly into  the curl of these passing waves and
TgOQxixs8dQ,1909840,1915519,you're getting all of that highlight  detail while still getting all of that  incredible shadow detail as well here
TgOQxixs8dQ,1915519,1920880,and remember this is 8k you have four  4ks within these windows and i can bring
TgOQxixs8dQ,1920880,1926480,back every part of the shot including  that sun right there and you get some  really cool things for anyone that does
TgOQxixs8dQ,1926480,1932159,underwater photography you'll notice a  couple little vortexes right here as  that wave went by those are all 35
TgOQxixs8dQ,1932159,1937919,megapixel stills and we could go ahead  and pull that at any point in time or  even go to something really slow like a
TgOQxixs8dQ,1937919,1944159,4k 300 which is my new uh smooth spot  that i love to hit in the water  i mean what one of the cool things that
TgOQxixs8dQ,1944159,1950399,in talking with you james is just that  with these underwater housings you again  have different ones for different
TgOQxixs8dQ,1950399,1955919,shooting styles so you've got your salty  for your kind of surf and then if you're  going a little bit deeper you've got the
TgOQxixs8dQ,1955919,1961440,gates or if you want to have a different  monitor on the back you've got different  backs different port caps all of those
TgOQxixs8dQ,1961440,1967760,things you know different water housings  to sh to suit the style of shooting you  have as opposed to there's only one
TgOQxixs8dQ,1967760,1973120,underwater housing option for you it's  as big as it's got to be and it's going  to be heavy whereas if you want a  lightweight one that was one of the
TgOQxixs8dQ,1973120,1979039,coolest things in speaking with you  james  yeah just just just what i did right  there the fact that i took the monitor
TgOQxixs8dQ,1979039,1985039,back off because maybe you wanted just a  pistol grip housing i just shortened  this housing so without the camera in it
TgOQxixs8dQ,1985039,1991440,it was right around uh four four  kilograms and i i should have just said  the the imperial or right around 11
TgOQxixs8dQ,1991440,1996799,pounds and with the camera lens and  battery in there you're going to be  right around 20 pounds but once again
TgOQxixs8dQ,1996799,2004000,with these customizable options you can  change the rear architecture of the  housing the front architecture of the  housing and salty is what i would say is
TgOQxixs8dQ,2004000,2010799,a splash housing good for about 66 feet  or 20 meters i know we talked about it  as well with our gates housings those
TgOQxixs8dQ,2010799,2017600,are going to go much deeper up to 200  feet or 60 meters and there's some great  options from john at gates as well
TgOQxixs8dQ,2017600,2022799,awesome i think at this point then we  might as well open up there's any  questions does anybody want to ask about
TgOQxixs8dQ,2022799,2028240,any of the rigs we've got go a bit more  in detail on them you know uh is you  know you want to see something a bit you
TgOQxixs8dQ,2028240,2034480,know hey what other stuff could i mount  on this how does that bolt together  uh feel free to chuck any questions uh
TgOQxixs8dQ,2034480,2040159,towards the end here and we can uh we  can dive into that  there we go oh yeah i just like the way
TgOQxixs8dQ,2040159,2045279,this guy looks  [Laughter]  i mean also one thing again showing off
TgOQxixs8dQ,2045279,2050560,the sun i don't think we actually spoke  about that so again another thing  working yesterday it was a hundred
TgOQxixs8dQ,2050560,2056158,fahrenheit the sun was out all day we  were there from what was it three till  eight so out there for a long time
TgOQxixs8dQ,2056158,2061280,having a sun hood and this again took a  bit of a beating you know it did it's  got it's got a little couple little
TgOQxixs8dQ,2061280,2067440,battle wounds from from the day but  that's that's how it works right that's  how our equipment goes we take it we use
TgOQxixs8dQ,2067440,2072960,it we try to beat it up as little as  possible and that's why all this stuff  is built so robust right so that it can
TgOQxixs8dQ,2072960,2078878,it can take a little bit of use that's  that's what we got to do they're tools  they're meant to be used
TgOQxixs8dQ,2078878,2084240,exactly so i'll just wait to see if  there's any questions feel free to  send them in
TgOQxixs8dQ,2084240,2089839,i i've seen a lot of comments here and  they're in their barney comments i love  red and red loves you back and it's good
TgOQxixs8dQ,2089839,2096000,to kind of see those come through but  i'm just noticing a couple where maybe  customers are or perhaps waiting for the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2096000,2102480,super 35 version of this and we got  scott balcom's question coming up here  and  for that customer that has a very
TgOQxixs8dQ,2102480,2107599,specific super 35 lenses and that's all  you shoot there is going to be a variant
TgOQxixs8dQ,2107599,2113920,an option that will be super 35 but for  myself and for you guys over there i  love the raptor vv because it is a
TgOQxixs8dQ,2113920,2122320,multi-format sensor right i do have that  ability to shoot super 35 today  6k 5k close to 200 frames per second and
TgOQxixs8dQ,2122320,2128000,really still have that vista vision  option as well so that's one of the  benefits of having the multi-tool or the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2128000,2134800,multi-format capabilities but once again  there will be an 8k super 35 variant  coming out later this year as well
TgOQxixs8dQ,2134800,2141680,i've just seen a comment coming from  robin james if you want to ping that one  up  um so yeah so yeah this is the red sun
TgOQxixs8dQ,2141680,2147200,hood so if you go on red.com and just  search sun hood that should come up um
TgOQxixs8dQ,2147200,2153839,uh if we can actually go ahead and take  this off actually we'll leave it on uh  but i don't want to ruin your rig
TgOQxixs8dQ,2154720,2160880,but yeah it's uh it bolts on to the very  bottom of the dsm c3 monitor and the the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2160880,2167119,dsmc monitor has a couple of mounting  points so you've got it mounted at the  top here but yeah it basically gives you  side and top
TgOQxixs8dQ,2167119,2173280,and you know  as we've been using it there's no you  know leaks coming around the side which  i think is very important you know if
TgOQxixs8dQ,2173280,2178400,you're operating the sun's right in  front of you you don't want any sort of  you know light leak coming from the top
TgOQxixs8dQ,2178400,2184480,it folds down very nicely as well so if  you want to put it in a backpack you can  take it off fold it down very very
TgOQxixs8dQ,2184480,2190720,easily which is really nice uh you know  very bendable as well so you've got  little rubber bits here that allow it to
TgOQxixs8dQ,2190720,2197119,bend and again it's made of a nice  hardened plastic so it will definitely  uh take a beating depending on what  you're doing oh yeah
TgOQxixs8dQ,2197119,2202240,and i was just trying to show you  johnny's point there no  no light leak coming through the top
TgOQxixs8dQ,2202240,2207440,right my hand is right in front of the  monitor and you can't see that and it's  the little things like that that i don't
TgOQxixs8dQ,2207440,2212960,have any little stray light creeping in  here and the other nice benefit too is  you still have access to all of your
TgOQxixs8dQ,2212960,2218960,user buttons and the additional mounting  points so this hood had a really good  thing to it and i'm really liking it
TgOQxixs8dQ,2218960,2224880,especially with the nice big thumb  screws there on the bottom i was  actually able to put that on and off  real quickly while you guys were just
TgOQxixs8dQ,2224880,2231599,chatting there  so i think james has one from i think  it's jason i i can't quite see i think
TgOQxixs8dQ,2231599,2237119,it is or justin i apologize if i'm  saying your name wrong so in terms of  the handle accessories i presume you're
TgOQxixs8dQ,2237119,2243599,talking about the top handle extensions  um so while those aren't available on  red.com if you reach out to one of your
TgOQxixs8dQ,2243599,2248640,sales reps this is something that has a  special order item uh you'll be able to  order so that will come with the one
TgOQxixs8dQ,2248640,2255119,inch front piece the 15mm rod we talked  about you've got a three inch a right  angle piece and another five inch piece
TgOQxixs8dQ,2255119,2260800,that you can then configure that james  is showing off there so uh just uh feel  free to reach out to one of your red
TgOQxixs8dQ,2260800,2266880,sales reps or or um reach out to us at  solitaryseries red.com and we can put  you in touch with a rep who can get that
TgOQxixs8dQ,2266880,2272400,sorted out for you it's just a special  order item at the moment  and i'm holding three pieces right now
TgOQxixs8dQ,2272400,2277839,right there's the curve this uh this is  i believe the five inch and then we have  the short three as well as that one
TgOQxixs8dQ,2277839,2283520,johnny you and i i know we got creative  with some small batteries and some slim  batteries and you can really
TgOQxixs8dQ,2283520,2288560,play around with your upper architecture  whether you're doing easy rig whether  you're doing a gimbal or you like that
TgOQxixs8dQ,2288560,2294960,mid-chest rig this is a really nice way  to make that handle have all of the  mounting points and everything you need  i mean one of the things again just to
TgOQxixs8dQ,2294960,2300480,kind of call out here in terms of the  height so if you're somebody that uses  red bricks those bricks are really
TgOQxixs8dQ,2300480,2306640,really tall so you can kind of see the  clearance here we've got a a hot top  adapter on there so it's definitely
TgOQxixs8dQ,2306640,2313280,something you should consider either  using those larger 150 watt hour micro  batteries or batteries that again just
TgOQxixs8dQ,2313280,2318400,just you know aren't really of that  older generation that  just protruded very very highly off the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2318400,2323440,top but again if you don't want that you  you can just stop the handle at the back
TgOQxixs8dQ,2323440,2328960,here and then you can free to use any  height battery that you want um yeah one  thing i don't think we discussed is the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2328960,2335119,little support arm here so uh yeah and  if you want to yeah that's i i i kind of  touched on it earlier just saying that
TgOQxixs8dQ,2335119,2340480,that multiple mounting points for the  handle to the body allows for a really
TgOQxixs8dQ,2340480,2345599,rigid and secure handle it's removable  so if you needed to remove that for a
TgOQxixs8dQ,2345599,2351200,reason you could right you could run  just the handle extension off the back  however
TgOQxixs8dQ,2351200,2356320,in my experience it's been amazing to  have this it feels super solid like when
TgOQxixs8dQ,2356320,2362000,you saw me knock my own glasses off  because like like the rig's just that  solid right it'll knock me over like
TgOQxixs8dQ,2362000,2367760,that that's kind of the idea that the  stuff like little details like this  extra support arm are built in and they
TgOQxixs8dQ,2367760,2372800,make it so that the rig's bulletproof  like it really is an easy to use piece
TgOQxixs8dQ,2372800,2378160,and i love what you you guys were saying  earlier about okay so maybe you want a  long battery but maybe you're using
TgOQxixs8dQ,2378160,2384160,something like an easy rig and you want  to afford yourself some more room to  counterbalance on the top you could take
TgOQxixs8dQ,2384160,2389359,the five inch throw it off the front  that gives you a lot more play in this
TgOQxixs8dQ,2389359,2395520,front to back direction for balancing  with the easy rig attachment so there's  just a lot of different things with the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2395520,2401920,handle and if in that case especially  you want is if you're right if you're  hanging the thing from the handle you
TgOQxixs8dQ,2401920,2409520,wouldn't have this i want three attached  three points of contact and this comes  with the top handle by itself so
TgOQxixs8dQ,2409520,2415680,basically if you buy the top plate and  the top handle it will come with the top  handle if you buy just the top handle it
TgOQxixs8dQ,2415680,2421839,will come in in the little box there so  that that's where you would end up  getting that little piece uh to support  the camera there i think we've had a few
TgOQxixs8dQ,2421839,2428640,more coming in so from ryan uh so uh  power question um  for uh gimbals okay two questions can
TgOQxixs8dQ,2428640,2435119,you use the dsm to power cable to decap  you sure can yep i've been using it on  my mobi pro uh same thing if you have a
TgOQxixs8dQ,2435119,2440720,ronin two to to their standard um as  opposed to a dtap that'll work as well
TgOQxixs8dQ,2440720,2446319,uh accessories to get more ext ports so  there's so there's nothing that is red
TgOQxixs8dQ,2446319,2452240,approved for ext to the ext breakout  what most of the accessories do is it's
TgOQxixs8dQ,2452240,2457440,ext to break out to one of the ports so  it's either to time code gen lock
TgOQxixs8dQ,2457440,2463760,control those kind of things i'm  guessing potentially what you're  referring to is you want to have a
TgOQxixs8dQ,2463760,2470560,a cine 7 or cine 5 that has a ext cable  for control and what a lot of what a lot
TgOQxixs8dQ,2470560,2477040,of the manufacturers do is they have  either an ext cable or a control cable  and then that's the one that then you'd
TgOQxixs8dQ,2477040,2483040,plug into one of these breakout boxes  the expander blade the mutiny i o  some of those kind of ones that have
TgOQxixs8dQ,2483040,2489920,that control port so it would just be a  different cable that you would need  totally agree that might also be a place  if you're working with that control port
TgOQxixs8dQ,2489920,2495520,cable that you would look for that  ignite digi translator box right so  that's another way you could solve that
TgOQxixs8dQ,2495520,2501200,problem  one more thing when i see ds-mc2 power  and i love using my dsm c2 power with my
TgOQxixs8dQ,2501200,2507359,raptor right my belt clips the ac power  those all plug directly into the camera  just know if you are powering the camera
TgOQxixs8dQ,2507359,2513839,just via that limo right you don't have  anything connected to this plate so your  two pin power on the plate your led
TgOQxixs8dQ,2513839,2519680,light unless there's a battery on there  and you're just going into the limo  that's not going to power these  additional accessories so that would be
TgOQxixs8dQ,2519680,2525839,one benefit of having the bower on that  full-size battery plate so just wanted  to make sure that was clear
TgOQxixs8dQ,2525839,2531599,all right we got some good questions i  think we've got a few more coming in uh  what's the question from luca is that a
TgOQxixs8dQ,2531599,2536680,question there james yeah let's go ahead  there
TgOQxixs8dQ,2538319,2543119,okay rt with onboard sony battery
TgOQxixs8dQ,2543359,2549119,so is he oh sorry is this  the sdi yeah  issue so it's really the important part
TgOQxixs8dQ,2549119,2554319,is that when you are  applying power to your accessory you
TgOQxixs8dQ,2554319,2559839,want to make sure that the sdi is not  plugged into the camera that's that's  really  that's
TgOQxixs8dQ,2559839,2565760,the baseline of it right there's there's  other places you can look into our  documentation that digs deeper on that  stuff but i feel like that's the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2565760,2571520,baseline that i that i try to have  people informed about so so basically in  this situation where you've had a
TgOQxixs8dQ,2571520,2577280,battery die and and you want to replace  it that the best practice would be to
TgOQxixs8dQ,2577280,2582720,then you know uh  remove the sdi  take the battery off put the new one on
TgOQxixs8dQ,2582720,2590240,put the sdi back in because at that  point the uh the uh the batteries died  so you know yeah and i mean i one easy
TgOQxixs8dQ,2590240,2596960,way to think about it is it's hard to  fry something with no power right so if  the battery is dead you're probably okay
TgOQxixs8dQ,2596960,2602960,but what i would say is exactly exactly  where johnny was just going is that  always remove the sdi before you swap
TgOQxixs8dQ,2602960,2608560,that battery that's going to be the big  take takeaway and that goes back into  you know if you break down what i said
TgOQxixs8dQ,2608560,2614319,first you just don't want to apply power  to your accessory with the sdi plugged
TgOQxixs8dQ,2614319,2620319,in that that's just the baseline of it i  mean and that's just a recommendation  and and the reason for that is is is
TgOQxixs8dQ,2620319,2626400,that when attaching something like a  dtap cable or a battery there's the  potential that power could connect
TgOQxixs8dQ,2626400,2632800,before ground now it's not something  that will happen every single time it's  something that happens you know once in
TgOQxixs8dQ,2632800,2638720,a blue moon when something happens with  within that something gets shorted and  then it finds ground through the sti so
TgOQxixs8dQ,2638720,2644160,that's basically the best way is to  remove that ground potential is  basically that the way that i think
TgOQxixs8dQ,2644160,2650319,about it yeah and i put that red article  the sdi support article in the chat but  notice that if you wanted to check any
TgOQxixs8dQ,2650319,2655359,other manufacturer that has an sdi they  will give that similar recommendation  this is just a best practice with
TgOQxixs8dQ,2655359,2660640,working with sdis so i love when someone  says why haven't you fixed it no that's  just the nature of working with sdis
TgOQxixs8dQ,2660640,2665920,there are those best practices  and
TgOQxixs8dQ,2665920,2671280,so my articulating arm we have here is  the bright tangerine titan um you know
TgOQxixs8dQ,2671280,2677599,quite a lot of nogarams those kind of  things you find that when you're using  them at a certain point they just give
TgOQxixs8dQ,2677599,2682800,way and they start  wobbling all over the place but with  this arm yesterday we've got two
TgOQxixs8dQ,2682800,2688000,anti-twist points so you've got a 3 8 16  bolt on the front and then a quarter 20
TgOQxixs8dQ,2688000,2693599,bolt on here and you know when when this  is screwed down this titan arm does not
TgOQxixs8dQ,2693599,2700079,move so much so that if you've got it  taken off the camera and i don't know if  you've got another one here somewhere uh
TgOQxixs8dQ,2700079,2705040,i think it's in this bag over here  actually  there we go
TgOQxixs8dQ,2707760,2712960,so much so that when it's actually  locked down like i i think it's called  like the sleep mode or something yeah
TgOQxixs8dQ,2712960,2719280,that basically you have to like force it  open to then be able to then start using  it again so this is a really solid arm
TgOQxixs8dQ,2719280,2725680,from bright tangerine  there's some ultra light arms that are  really good as well with the with the  ball joints that get a load of really
TgOQxixs8dQ,2725680,2731839,nice tension on them uh but yeah this  and then uh something like an ultralight  arm have been some of the favorite arms  that i've used especially when you're
TgOQxixs8dQ,2731839,2738000,putting a monitor on there yeah i agree  a buddy saved me from looking like a  total idiot with these because i got one
TgOQxixs8dQ,2738000,2744319,and i'm like mine's defective it won't  even open up man i can't get this thing  don't do it's like nah you just gotta
TgOQxixs8dQ,2744319,2750960,actually use your muscles for it  i open it up and man the thing's never  never failed me since it's like once you
TgOQxixs8dQ,2750960,2757760,understand like okay it is a little  sticky in that sleep mode to get it  opened up get it where you want it  positioned lock it down the thing does
TgOQxixs8dQ,2757760,2763119,not move it's absolutely right i mean  one of the sick things as well is that  these are actually like hot swap
TgOQxixs8dQ,2763119,2768480,removable so one of the things that is  usually quite annoying is oh i've got to  unscrew it so potentially what you could
TgOQxixs8dQ,2768480,2774319,do is maybe hey i want to have an evf  with a bolt on there and now this is now  going to go over to my ac who's got a
TgOQxixs8dQ,2774319,2781680,titan arm over on this side and i can  move it over and really quickly just  bolt it onto this um so yeah super cool
TgOQxixs8dQ,2781680,2786720,i i saw a comment there saying that the  titan arm got discontinued and that's  why we've got a couple of them here
TgOQxixs8dQ,2786720,2792880,because they are so awesome yeah  so let's just bolt that back on there  well and you brought up a great point
TgOQxixs8dQ,2792880,2798480,there johnny on monitoring let's not  forget and this kind of leads into this  next question here and i know clay's  going to take this because it's about
TgOQxixs8dQ,2798480,2804960,gimbals but remember these raptors have  dual 12g sbi out so if you don't want to  grow the upper architecture with that
TgOQxixs8dQ,2804960,2810319,rmi module that's why you have that io  or those sdis facing in the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2810319,2816640,back rear of the camera where everyone  wants it to be and you don't necessarily  have to grow that architecture play  something similar to that right yeah
TgOQxixs8dQ,2816640,2822400,yeah i mean what i would say is that on  both mobi pro and ronin 2 it fits so it
TgOQxixs8dQ,2822400,2827520,being tall  sure yeah it's kind of tall for the cage  in there but
TgOQxixs8dQ,2827520,2833839,as long as it fits and i've got secure  mounting points it doesn't really bother  me i would say if you're trying to
TgOQxixs8dQ,2833839,2840559,really minimize or use a smaller gimbal  that's one of the great things about red  control right so now maybe the solution
TgOQxixs8dQ,2840559,2846880,is you put your sdi monitor you get a  little phone mount right next to it now  you've got essentially the same
TgOQxixs8dQ,2846880,2853680,functionality of being able to touch and  control your settings while looking at a  nice playback monitor simultaneously i
TgOQxixs8dQ,2853680,2859839,would say that there are huge values to  the rmi in my opinion i mean one of the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2859839,2866800,things that i've seen people saying they  want to do it through the monitor is  with the teradex so with a small hd and
TgOQxixs8dQ,2866800,2874240,the cine7 you can have a built-in  receiver into a cine7 so you can have  that away with an ac and then you can
TgOQxixs8dQ,2874240,2881280,also buy a module for the teradex i  think it's called the camera control  module and with the newer bolt
TgOQxixs8dQ,2881280,2887680,transmitters you bolt that on the bottom  and it's then able to communicate that  camera control a control port then goes
TgOQxixs8dQ,2887680,2895119,into the camera side and then it will  then transmit video and also that camera  control wirelessly so again dsmc3
TgOQxixs8dQ,2895119,2901760,monitor is great because you've got a  lot of the red specific control  functions in there for focus those kind  of things but if you just want to be
TgOQxixs8dQ,2901760,2908000,able just to do iso frame rates those  kind of things having that setup is  probably the way you want to go and it's
TgOQxixs8dQ,2908000,2914400,flexible if you go to a komodo or a  different camera or these kind of things  where the rmi is specific for the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2914400,2920160,v-raptor on commodore it won't work that  is a system where you can integrate that  very nicely amongst other camera systems
TgOQxixs8dQ,2920160,2924400,as well i can hear happy acs already
TgOQxixs8dQ,2925520,2931599,got a little bit of a lens question here  and i know clay you've been working with  the rf lenses as well as myself um care
TgOQxixs8dQ,2931599,2937599,to take this one  ah  rf  coverage i know on the 24 to 70 it does
TgOQxixs8dQ,2937599,2945200,vignette slightly when you're at 24 and  i think on the 16 mil i'm guessing the  really wide lenses for that large of
TgOQxixs8dQ,2945200,2951680,sensor coverage you're just gonna want  to look at the lenses actual focal  coverage right like what image is it
TgOQxixs8dQ,2951680,2959200,throwing off the back and make sure that  that aligns with the dims on the sensor  itself um yeah it sounds like you're
TgOQxixs8dQ,2959200,2965200,seeing a little bit of that vignetting  that does happen and that's just based  on coverage there's a fantastic tool on
TgOQxixs8dQ,2965200,2970400,cvp's website with their lens coverage  there's also a few apps out there you  can do
TgOQxixs8dQ,2970400,2976079,this camera with this lens and it will  tell you the image circle so it might be  worth checking that out just to see what
TgOQxixs8dQ,2976079,2982400,the coverage is i know what millimeters  maybe you drop down to 7k or something  like that or 6k uh to kind of get that
TgOQxixs8dQ,2982400,2987680,coverage that you want because obviously  being designed for canon sensors they're  usually a bit taller and we got a bit
TgOQxixs8dQ,2987680,2993680,wider with our 17x9 sensor exactly which  makes a ton of sense for where you're  seeing it right on those edges of the
TgOQxixs8dQ,2993680,3000000,outside as opposed to seeing it in a  full circle where you've got the top  missing and i'm using that 24 to 70
TgOQxixs8dQ,3000000,3006720,right now and you are seeing that slight  discoloration i actually would suggest  stay with 8k full frame throw a 95 guide
TgOQxixs8dQ,3006720,3013920,in there and you now are getting all of  your wide corners that you want and  you're not having to worry about those  slight discolorations in the corners and
TgOQxixs8dQ,3013920,3021119,the other thing to keep in mind here  watch this with the rf lens here i know  this is supposed to be 2 8 all the way  throughout but watch the histogram here
TgOQxixs8dQ,3021119,3026240,this is a canon lens it does get darker  as it zooms in that's part of the canon
TgOQxixs8dQ,3026240,3031280,rf lenses that's not a red thing so i  just wanted to call that out
TgOQxixs8dQ,3031280,3036960,i think we've got a question there  options for evs so uh zacuto has  probably been the one that i've seen
TgOQxixs8dQ,3036960,3042319,everyone going for i think you've shot  with it a few times there's the zacuto  chameleon pro that's very nice the
TgOQxixs8dQ,3042319,3047920,gratical eye the evf that i have rigged  down here is a bit more on the pricier  side with the astro design that's a
TgOQxixs8dQ,3047920,3053680,really nice evf that's mainly i've seen  rental houses sometimes carrying that  one there's a few other options out
TgOQxixs8dQ,3053680,3059839,there as well from other third parties  but you know uh zakuto has been the one  that we've been  kind of suggesting uh kind of through
TgOQxixs8dQ,3059839,3065839,our channels as well yeah it's the one i  see most often  in my experience especially just for the  size that's the thing sometimes you just
TgOQxixs8dQ,3065839,3071760,want one that's as small as possible you  can rig on there and flexible again to  go to different cameras go to the komodo
TgOQxixs8dQ,3071760,3077599,maybe you've got a different third-party  camera for your b camera you can move  around and be flexible with that as well  yes
TgOQxixs8dQ,3077599,3082960,now i i know none of us are going to  talk about the next firmware update but  i just wanted to say with everything
TgOQxixs8dQ,3082960,3088240,that it's working now i would give it a  go and and stay tuned because there will  be some more firmware updates but even
TgOQxixs8dQ,3088240,3094960,just showing you what i'm doing here an  rf lens with a little red control app  notice i'm actually controlling focus
TgOQxixs8dQ,3094960,3101599,moving that box around and you're seeing  that there in real time so being able to  control that rf lens have multiple rack
TgOQxixs8dQ,3101599,3109280,points and doing that and pretty quickly  here and once again this is before the  update and it's still in beta
TgOQxixs8dQ,3109280,3116160,yeah i love that i've actually been even  experimenting pretty pretty deep in this  i put uh put my rf lens on on the gimbal
TgOQxixs8dQ,3116160,3121280,with the rmi and the touchscreen with no  focus motor on the gimbal which is i
TgOQxixs8dQ,3121280,3126400,felt insane i was like what do i do but  honestly i was operating with ready rig
TgOQxixs8dQ,3126400,3132160,and i was able to just hold the camera  study with one hand touch where i wanted  to be in focus and i got some actually
TgOQxixs8dQ,3132160,3138319,surprisingly great results i was like  okay all right this might be a little  bit better than me in certain
TgOQxixs8dQ,3138319,3143760,circumstances which i'm like happy to  have  and i actually really like when i get
TgOQxixs8dQ,3143760,3150319,out in the water with that water housing  i need to go between my auto focus modes  so if i hit down down or actually only
TgOQxixs8dQ,3150319,3156800,down once notice you're right here and  you can change your start autofocus  i can change my size i can change
TgOQxixs8dQ,3156800,3161839,whether it's continuous or single and  this is all right here on that side  panel and all you'd have to do is tell
TgOQxixs8dQ,3161839,3167838,your ac to hit down once and they get  all that autofocus control right there
TgOQxixs8dQ,3170079,3175280,i think we're getting close to a good  timer so feel free to fire in the last  few questions i think answer a few more
TgOQxixs8dQ,3175280,3178760,if there's any more
TgOQxixs8dQ,3180480,3185520,all right i think we got all the rest of  them i'm seeing some more uh thank you  for scott and for everyone else that are
TgOQxixs8dQ,3185520,3191440,putting some good information in here  yeah  yeah scott's actually got a great video  on the chameleon yeah if you want to get
TgOQxixs8dQ,3191440,3198559,an overview of looking at a chameleon as  a good video on that  yeah actually i enjoyed that one myself
TgOQxixs8dQ,3198559,3204400,all right guys i i'm seeing more barney  comments everyone's looking excited and  wants to get the camera in hand so if if
TgOQxixs8dQ,3204400,3211200,we're good i think we'll just go ahead  and wrap it up  great point by scott
TgOQxixs8dQ,3211440,3218640,you can customize those menus and the  other thing to keep in mind too  is when you switch over to
TgOQxixs8dQ,3218640,3224319,and of course this is the perfect time  my camera just died so i can't show it  to you boot up r1 and we can see if we
TgOQxixs8dQ,3224319,3230960,can do it but yeah but but basically  you've got three customizable pages as  scott was saying there so you can hold
TgOQxixs8dQ,3230960,3238640,down on any of those customizable pages  and assign basically whatever you want  so peaking false color autofocus a
TgOQxixs8dQ,3238640,3243680,preset whatever you want be able to  toggle between those very nicely just  while this camera boots up we can we can
TgOQxixs8dQ,3243680,3249119,give you a quick look at that and that  tools when you're on the when you're on  the actual focus knob tab that's the one
TgOQxixs8dQ,3249119,3256720,with the little white circle on it you  can actually hit the little  additional tools there and it allows you  to pick rack speed rack rack
TgOQxixs8dQ,3256720,3261839,acceleration  how many turns of the wheel and it  actually gives you eight more buttons at
TgOQxixs8dQ,3261839,3267839,the top of the screen so it's a great  way to just turn on that lens data tools  and that's where you could go from maybe
TgOQxixs8dQ,3267839,3273680,a wider box to a more narrow box if  you're doing a portrait shoot or a car  shoot or something very tunnel now yeah
TgOQxixs8dQ,3273680,3281040,james can i get our overhead yep you got  it thank you kindly  so wait for that to go full size and
TgOQxixs8dQ,3281040,3287839,let's see if see if we can get an angle  that's viewable here so obviously uh not  designed for a close-up lcd shot here
TgOQxixs8dQ,3287839,3294079,but uh if we just come up you can see  we've basically got a user page and  yesterday actually i was using this uh
TgOQxixs8dQ,3294079,3299680,for for our peaking tools so you can  toggle them and what i'll show here i  know it's not quite the ideal angle but
TgOQxixs8dQ,3299680,3308240,if you hold down on one of the buttons  you've then got a whole list of you know  zebra guides sdi tools iris open close
TgOQxixs8dQ,3308240,3314480,um sensor sync shift if you're doing  virtual production you need to go up by  tiny tiny fractions to sync to that
TgOQxixs8dQ,3314480,3320880,frame uh and and then if you have any  presets i don't know if this camera's  got any presets on it uh no presets but
TgOQxixs8dQ,3320880,3326480,if you had presets it would then you can  toggle between all those presets very  very easily
TgOQxixs8dQ,3326480,3333520,and and you have three full user pages  there so if you notice right out of box  you only have one it does default to
TgOQxixs8dQ,3333520,3340480,the other two pages not being fully on  and once my camera boots up right here  um i did take the time to make one of
TgOQxixs8dQ,3340480,3346160,those pages just be resolutions and  frame rates and the next one could be  looks and the third one can be for your
TgOQxixs8dQ,3346160,3352240,dit and just uh i'm still not quite up  yet  all right we had one question while
TgOQxixs8dQ,3352240,3357520,that's just booting up james about the  locking ring for lenses so
TgOQxixs8dQ,3357520,3363680,obviously as we've got a rf mount camera  you know you've got a really wide  versatility of lens options you can use
TgOQxixs8dQ,3363680,3371040,you can use rf pl ef lpl uh m mount any  of those and you know as we've got a big
TgOQxixs8dQ,3371040,3377680,old prime ester lens on here you know  you're gonna need some lens support if  you've got a really long heavy lens on
TgOQxixs8dQ,3377680,3383599,there basically if it's got a lens  support shoe on it you should probably  be supporting the lens but additionally
TgOQxixs8dQ,3383599,3389280,if you want to provide some additional  support a lot of people you know ignite  digi bright tangerine
TgOQxixs8dQ,3389280,3395280,make these uh support adapters that  depending on the pl mount or whatever  mount you have because the raptor's got
TgOQxixs8dQ,3395280,3401920,a load of quarter twenties on on on the  top and and the front of the camera you  can bolt directly into those and it
TgOQxixs8dQ,3401920,3408400,gives you a really rigid mounting system  and additionally even with that locking  ring it just really makes it a really
TgOQxixs8dQ,3408400,3414400,solid and tight mount to the camera  one of the things to you know different  mounts have different tolerances
TgOQxixs8dQ,3414400,3421520,depending on what you're putting it on  so you don't always have to force the  locking ring to its kind of what like 10
TgOQxixs8dQ,3421520,3427520,o'clock kind of position the amount that  clay's got on here because of the  tolerances and how that mounts designed
TgOQxixs8dQ,3427520,3433040,it kind of only really goes around to  about like nine or  just just past their clock and that's
TgOQxixs8dQ,3433040,3438880,where it's really solid so you haven't  got to force the locking ring beyond  where it kind of sits nice and kind of
TgOQxixs8dQ,3438880,3445760,finger tight is kind of what you would  kind of think about that's the thing i  was gonna mainly bring up is talking to  everybody on the engineering team and
TgOQxixs8dQ,3445760,3451040,talking about how these mounts work i i  was pressing too hard right i think  that's something that that we want to
TgOQxixs8dQ,3451040,3456799,make sure people understand is you don't  have to push it to a specific position  right you're just going until you feel
TgOQxixs8dQ,3456799,3463200,tension on what you're mounting in that  lens mount and if you're pushing further  pushing further anything over time is
TgOQxixs8dQ,3463200,3468720,going to start to give as you overcrank  it that's why finger tight's really the  methodology you should be thinking about
TgOQxixs8dQ,3468720,3474480,here  right and you can see that right there  and exactly so on on those rf lenses
TgOQxixs8dQ,3474480,3480400,they will kind of lock the whole way  some pl do a bit differently or there's  the kipper time mounts which don't even
TgOQxixs8dQ,3480400,3486640,mount to the rf and they just mount to  the very front of the body so the strata  i i've got the clear strata there's an
TgOQxixs8dQ,3486640,3493119,nd strata coming soon but they just bolt  to the quarter 20s and don't even sit on  the rf mount so again different options
TgOQxixs8dQ,3493119,3498640,depending on how heavy of a lens you're  putting on there if you're putting some  heavy cooks a big prime ester on there a
TgOQxixs8dQ,3498640,3503920,mount like that might be more suitable  than one that doesn't even have a  support option so check what support
TgOQxixs8dQ,3503920,3509040,options there are available for amount  that you want to choose and and kind of  like tim's suggesting right here i could
TgOQxixs8dQ,3509040,3514319,be  miles or feet away from my camera and i  can say hey just go over hit up once
TgOQxixs8dQ,3514319,3523280,you're going to see all my presets here  and with one button here i can go to 48  frames per second or 8k 120 or 4k 300
TgOQxixs8dQ,3523280,3528640,and then go back to 8k 24 and that's  very responsive notice i also have my
TgOQxixs8dQ,3528640,3534960,looks right here as well on the second  page if you go up twice now you're going  to have all my looks and now i'm going
TgOQxixs8dQ,3534960,3541200,to go ahead and have that black and  white light applied and i can very  easily just go back to my ak-24 look at
TgOQxixs8dQ,3541200,3547599,that pretty responsive and your director  can call that out in pretty much real  time
TgOQxixs8dQ,3547599,3552960,i just saw a comment there as well so it  depends on the amount it depends on the  mount and the lens you know the the
TgOQxixs8dQ,3552960,3558720,weight as well so  there are some lenses that are very long  but very very light there are some
TgOQxixs8dQ,3558720,3564240,lenses that are very very short and very  very heavy you know thinking like uh  tequilas and cooks yeah they're they're
TgOQxixs8dQ,3564240,3569920,they're very very dense in a kind of  short weight uh kind of distribution i  guess so those lenses you want to make
TgOQxixs8dQ,3569920,3575119,sure you've got mountain support or some  additional lens support again if there's  a support shoe on it you should probably
TgOQxixs8dQ,3575119,3580160,be using it because the manufacturer is  going hey it's a heavy lens probably a  good kind of best practice
TgOQxixs8dQ,3580160,3585520,totally agree  all right guys  should we wrap this up yeah i mean
TgOQxixs8dQ,3585520,3590720,that's an hour we i feel like we did  pretty good we rambled on that
TgOQxixs8dQ,3590720,3596880,thank you guys so much for watching this  was a great episode we hope we answered  your questions effectively feel free to
TgOQxixs8dQ,3596880,3604319,hit the saw  the email or the red to give us any  questions or any comments and we we love
