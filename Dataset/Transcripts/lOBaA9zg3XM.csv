lOBaA9zg3XM,5920,11040,welcome back guys  okay you weren't here before but
lOBaA9zg3XM,11040,16880,what i mean is that welcome back to  budget gaming pcs that's right it has
lOBaA9zg3XM,16880,24080,been  over a year since we've been able to do  anything stream pre-recorded video
lOBaA9zg3XM,24080,30960,anything showing you guys building a  legitimate gaming pc  with a dedicated gpu for under a
lOBaA9zg3XM,30960,36480,thousand dollars but that is exactly  what we are going to be doing today
lOBaA9zg3XM,36480,42559,sort of okay so here's the thing when we  started planning this  this video
lOBaA9zg3XM,42559,50079,we didn't have our hands on amd's new  6500 xt gpu yet we had high hopes for it
lOBaA9zg3XM,50079,56160,it was supposed to have not enough ram  to be appealing to miners it was  supposed to have a low enough msrp that
lOBaA9zg3XM,56160,62480,you could actually build a gaming rig  for under a thousand dollars but it was  also supposed to have
lOBaA9zg3XM,62480,68240,enough performance to be competitive  with you know budget gpus from two or
lOBaA9zg3XM,68240,73920,three years ago and i guess it does kind  of have that but we're not sure now that
lOBaA9zg3XM,73920,80159,we actually have our hands on it and  we've tested it if it makes sense to put  it in the machine fortunately we thought
lOBaA9zg3XM,80159,86479,of that because we're gonna let you guys  choose as we go through and we build  this rig we're gonna let you guys decide
lOBaA9zg3XM,86479,92320,do we stick with our onboard graphics on  our 5600 g cpu or do we go for the
lOBaA9zg3XM,92320,99360,dedicated gpu or do you guys want to see  me put them head to head is this thing  even worth the nearest msrp you can
lOBaA9zg3XM,99360,104799,actually buy these things for just over  200 us dollars they're in stock now is
lOBaA9zg3XM,104799,110079,it even worth it compared to just  sticking with onboard so that's the  theme of the day and it is brought to
lOBaA9zg3XM,110079,116320,you by micro center micro center is a  store and i don't have my talking points
lOBaA9zg3XM,116320,122799,up yet so here we go  micro center is a fantastic brick and  mortar store for shopping pc hardware
lOBaA9zg3XM,122799,128959,and everything else technology they've  got over 25 locations across the us and  over 30 000 items in stock microsoft has
lOBaA9zg3XM,128959,134800,what you need to finish your pc setup or  finish any diy tech project and we're  going to have them linked down below
lOBaA9zg3XM,134800,142720,they're offering new customers a free  240 gig ssd valid in store only no  purchase necessary new customers only so
lOBaA9zg3XM,142720,148640,let's get this started with our  motherboard um  i know this has been kind of a theme
lOBaA9zg3XM,148640,155120,over the last  couple of years but due to shortages  we went with
lOBaA9zg3XM,155120,160560,this board  it's the b550 tough gaming from asus we
lOBaA9zg3XM,160560,166080,went with the non-wi-fi version excuse  me b550 plus tough gaming from asus we
lOBaA9zg3XM,166080,172319,went with the non-wi-fi version because  we were looking to kind of save a buck  make this an affordable rig that people
lOBaA9zg3XM,172319,178159,could actually build for themselves and  um  you know enjoy a
lOBaA9zg3XM,178159,183440,gaming experience  i don't want to oversell it
lOBaA9zg3XM,183440,190080,it's such a shame i mean man my  do you ever feel like you're just in
lOBaA9zg3XM,190080,196959,kind of an abusive relationship lately  you guys  no i'm serious though like like
lOBaA9zg3XM,196959,203200,we  said before right companies are not your  friends right they they don't care about
lOBaA9zg3XM,203200,209840,you it's it's profits first at the end  of the day because corporations  especially publicly held ones are
lOBaA9zg3XM,209840,216640,beholden to their shareholders first and  foremost but that doesn't change the  fact that whether it's you know
lOBaA9zg3XM,216640,223680,corporations whether we're talking  sports teams that are corporations or  uh manufacturers of the products that
lOBaA9zg3XM,223680,230000,we're passionate about and that we love  be it be it games or be it pcs uh
lOBaA9zg3XM,230000,237040,they  maybe we're just falling for the  marketing hype or maybe it's just human  nature we we develop relationships with
lOBaA9zg3XM,237040,242319,these entities right  i mean why are you guys tuned into this  stream when you're supposed to be at
lOBaA9zg3XM,242319,248640,work right because you just you love  linus media group incorporated so much  that you guys wanna you just wanna hang
lOBaA9zg3XM,248640,254480,out with us you wanna hang with me and  david and ploof over there who's  supervising me to make sure i don't say
lOBaA9zg3XM,254480,260479,anything wrong and  chase who's wearing a beautiful pink  toque hey thanks chase
lOBaA9zg3XM,260479,265520,um  and so you know what happens is you just
lOBaA9zg3XM,265520,271600,you  you wanna you wanna trust them right you  wanna believe them and time and time
lOBaA9zg3XM,271600,277680,again they say hey we're gonna have this  new product it's gonna be super exciting  you're gonna love it
lOBaA9zg3XM,277680,283120,and then  just over the last couple of years it's  just been like getting pooed on
lOBaA9zg3XM,283120,289120,over and over and over again and not in  like uh not in like a kinky like you're  into it sort of way
lOBaA9zg3XM,289120,294400,in just a uh an uncomfortable  this wasn't consensual
lOBaA9zg3XM,294400,301759,kind of way and the 6500 xt was just yet  another example of that to be clear
lOBaA9zg3XM,301759,309199,i think that amd at least made an effort  here i think that  in trying to make the card not appealing
lOBaA9zg3XM,309199,315440,to minors in  any meaningful way  they just overshot the mark a little bit
lOBaA9zg3XM,315440,321120,and made it not very appealing to  um gamers so
lOBaA9zg3XM,321120,327199,let's talk a little bit more about what  makes the 6500xt such a challenge but  also the saving grace which is that we
lOBaA9zg3XM,327199,334240,can put an apu into this socket that  actually has a decent gpu on board and  still get an okay gaming experience so
lOBaA9zg3XM,334240,340000,for our motherboard we've spent about  170 it's it's full-sized atx which means  we get all the expansion that comes with
lOBaA9zg3XM,340000,347039,that you can switch me over to my  overhead it's got amd's am4 socket which  is a okay a dead platform at this point
lOBaA9zg3XM,347039,355199,we're not going to see any more upgrades  to this other than  maybe the 50 uh the 5800 xt with the 3d
lOBaA9zg3XM,355199,361280,v cache that kind of stuff amd claims  we're going to see a significant gaming  boost from that they i think they want
lOBaA9zg3XM,361280,368240,to retain the gaming crown i think that  remains to be seen dual channel ddr4  memory a couple of m.2 slots including
lOBaA9zg3XM,368240,375360,uh this one that's where you put the  wi-fi card on the on the wi-fi version  of it and then for our ssd we've gone
lOBaA9zg3XM,375360,383120,with the 660p series that's one thing  that actually hasn't been too bad  throughout the silicon shortage is ssds
lOBaA9zg3XM,383120,389440,availability's been pretty good prices  have continued to steadily march  downward this puppy costs us under a
lOBaA9zg3XM,389440,397360,hundred dollars so it's ninety dollars  on sale at microcenter right now i mean  i remember when the only affordable size
lOBaA9zg3XM,397360,404000,of ssd was like 80 gigs and that was  still 250 bucks so to have a boot drive
lOBaA9zg3XM,404000,410479,and throw a bunch of your games on it  you were literally talking about buying  multiples putting them in raid 0 on your
lOBaA9zg3XM,410479,417199,sata motherboard which caused all kinds  of bottlenecks between the cpu and  chipset link and all that kind of stuff
lOBaA9zg3XM,417199,424720,man those were good times those were  good times  i mean it was it was fun right like i i
lOBaA9zg3XM,424720,430400,liked the i liked the work around i  liked trying to trying to find ways  around it you know what i ended up doing
lOBaA9zg3XM,430400,436400,i treated myself to  a hardware raid card secondhand from i
lOBaA9zg3XM,436400,442880,think it was adaptec or something like  that back in the day and then i plugged  that into one of my one of my pci
lOBaA9zg3XM,442880,448080,express slots so that i could alleviate  that bottleneck by using pcie
lOBaA9zg3XM,448080,453199,all right let's go ahead and install our  cpu one of the most exciting products
lOBaA9zg3XM,453199,459440,over the last couple of years has  actually been amd's apus and it's not  that intel doesn't have their own flavor
lOBaA9zg3XM,459440,464639,of apu intel has onboard graphics on  virtually all of their cpus
lOBaA9zg3XM,464639,469919,and they just don't call them apus but  what's so exciting about amd's is that
lOBaA9zg3XM,469919,475039,particularly on a driver level amd just  has
lOBaA9zg3XM,475039,481120,so much  so much more experience than intel to  the point where
lOBaA9zg3XM,481120,487840,everything from performance to  compatibility  just makes more sense on on an amd
lOBaA9zg3XM,487840,492879,onboard gpu and i'm hoping i'm rooting  for that to change over the next year or
lOBaA9zg3XM,492879,501840,two as intel launches more products with  their xe graphics but for the time being  5600 g six cores 12 threads is clocked
lOBaA9zg3XM,501840,508160,high enough that it's not going to be a  bottleneck of any sort when you well  okay i shouldn't quite say that because
lOBaA9zg3XM,508160,514320,we managed to pick one of the only gpus  on the market that  this particular platform is going to
lOBaA9zg3XM,514320,521360,manage to bottleneck i'll give you guys  an explanation of that but in terms of  cpu raw performance it's not going to
lOBaA9zg3XM,521360,528640,create any kind of bottleneck in a  reasonable system  and most importantly it has a 7cu
lOBaA9zg3XM,528640,534080,onboard gpu that's going to be enough  for us to play at least like you know  basic games you're going to be able to
lOBaA9zg3XM,534080,540800,play your esports titles at 1080p no  problem you're going to be able to play  more complex games at you know maybe
lOBaA9zg3XM,540800,546959,720p okay so you're not turning up the  resolution you're turning all the  details down but at least you can
lOBaA9zg3XM,546959,552720,freaking game  so we're pulling off the bracket so we  can install amd's
lOBaA9zg3XM,552720,558560,much much better than intel stock cooler  though with that said intel has a new  stock cooler coming for this generation
lOBaA9zg3XM,558560,564480,apparently that's supposed to be way  better and that is something that we are  going to be testing uh we we have that
lOBaA9zg3XM,564480,569839,that's that's planned right ploof  we're doing intel stock cooler versus  intel stock cooler
lOBaA9zg3XM,569839,574959,yeah the featherweight the featherweight  showdown of the century you know the uh
lOBaA9zg3XM,574959,582080,the the fight that's barely even on the  card  the one everyone forgot about
lOBaA9zg3XM,582080,588800,i don't know we have fun with that kind  of stuff though uh do note guys i  haven't forgotten thermal compound it is  pre-applied to amd's stock cooler and
lOBaA9zg3XM,588800,594399,because this is a budget build i would  nearly always recommend sticking with  the stock cooler
lOBaA9zg3XM,594399,600640,aftermarket cooling is the kind of thing  that's it's great right you want to run  quieter you want to run cooler you want
lOBaA9zg3XM,600640,607200,to do some overclocking whatever the  case may be absolutely you know treat  yourself to a nice little cooler from
lOBaA9zg3XM,607200,613360,the likes of be quiet or knock to a  but if you are just looking to get the
lOBaA9zg3XM,613360,618560,game running  man if there's a stock cooler included  you should absolutely go for it so we're
lOBaA9zg3XM,618560,623760,just going to get i realize i haven't  done very much actual instructional  stuff on this
lOBaA9zg3XM,623760,629760,build video so far so we're going to go  ahead and tighten down our screws in a  cross pattern here
lOBaA9zg3XM,629839,636959,with our ltt store screwdriver man guys  i got a story to tell you about the  screwdriver i'm not gonna let this build
lOBaA9zg3XM,636959,643040,stretch out into a four-hour video again  this week so i'm gonna just make sure  i'm building computers while i'm while
lOBaA9zg3XM,643040,649360,we're doing story time  but you guys have been you've been  asking me you've been hounding me when  is the screwdriver coming when is the
lOBaA9zg3XM,649360,655600,screwdriver coming and i gave you guys  an update recently where i went well  look  one of the big problems
lOBaA9zg3XM,655600,661040,is that our manufacturer for the  ratchets who is based in taiwan was
lOBaA9zg3XM,661040,667120,acquired by one of the biggest tool  companies in the world  and we didn't find that out in a timely
lOBaA9zg3XM,667120,672480,manner so we were sitting there going  hey when are you going to produce our  ratchets hey when are you going to
lOBaA9zg3XM,672480,678560,produce our ratchets we need our golden  samples we need to we need to check them  over for quality when are you going to  produce our ratchets they're like oh
lOBaA9zg3XM,678560,685279,yeah we'll do it we'll do it we'll do it  we'll do it  oh by the way  we've been acquired by a competitor we
lOBaA9zg3XM,685279,692320,actually have an enormous conflict of  interest and  no business incentive whatsoever to oh
lOBaA9zg3XM,692320,698800,wow okay that was a whole thing we have  no business incentive whatsoever to  produce really anything for you
lOBaA9zg3XM,698800,705519,so we've been exploring other  manufacturers and  yesterday i made a decision that
lOBaA9zg3XM,705519,712639,may have been one of the most difficult  decisions of my career  and that is that i
lOBaA9zg3XM,712639,719040,um  i have  i have telegraphed my willingness to
lOBaA9zg3XM,719040,725360,kiss our deposit  with our  taiwan-based manufacturer goodbye
lOBaA9zg3XM,725360,730639,because we've gotten samples from a  china-based manufacturer that actually
lOBaA9zg3XM,730639,735760,are higher quality than the ones that we  initially got from the taiwan-based
lOBaA9zg3XM,735760,740800,manufacturer because we do actually have  a couple of of samples from them we just  don't have what was supposed to be the
lOBaA9zg3XM,740800,747360,big run of golden samples  and  i have made the decision to
lOBaA9zg3XM,747360,754560,to  to kiss our deposit goodbye  if we don't have a resolution to this
lOBaA9zg3XM,754560,761120,problem by the end of the week which i  don't think will happen  and that deposit is going to be
lOBaA9zg3XM,761120,766800,somewhere in the neighborhood of around  140 000 us dollars
lOBaA9zg3XM,769040,774320,that's business right  that's um
lOBaA9zg3XM,774720,780639,yeah that's uh  that's been that's been weighing on me  pretty heavily over the last couple of
lOBaA9zg3XM,780639,786720,days because i found out about  the update to the situation
lOBaA9zg3XM,787200,792720,on  tuesday tuesday morning i guess sorry  i'm a little
lOBaA9zg3XM,792720,800320,saying it out loud makes it feel  a little more real my  my wife is not impressed
lOBaA9zg3XM,800320,805440,with anything she's not impressed with  the situation she's not impressed with
lOBaA9zg3XM,805440,812639,my decision necessarily  i i made the business case for why we  should do it because
lOBaA9zg3XM,812639,818639,ultimately what it comes down to is  this is a project that we've invested
lOBaA9zg3XM,818639,825199,already seven figures into with  development costs engineering um
lOBaA9zg3XM,825199,830880,molds and other tooling costs  pre-production samples like this is  already an
lOBaA9zg3XM,830880,837199,enormous project for us because we're  doing it at a scale that's very  different from
lOBaA9zg3XM,837199,844480,really anything else that we've ever  done before like our order is going to  be for a hundred thousand units and so
lOBaA9zg3XM,844480,851600,my justification to her was  look and actually to the rest of the  team this is not a decision that i just
lOBaA9zg3XM,851600,857360,go in and make on my own because it  affects everyone right
lOBaA9zg3XM,857360,864720,but i basically said okay look  we know that this manufacturer has  no incentive whatsoever to produce our
lOBaA9zg3XM,864720,871120,product why would they make our product  when they can just make their product
lOBaA9zg3XM,871120,878720,obviously right  so based on that we have no way of  knowing when if ever they will produce
lOBaA9zg3XM,878720,885360,our product because there's nothing in  the contract that stipulates a drop dead  delivery date and
lOBaA9zg3XM,885360,891120,the problem is that particularly lately  it's really easy to use covet as an
lOBaA9zg3XM,891120,896959,excuse for just about anything right oh  well why can't you get it oh you know
lOBaA9zg3XM,896959,903360,covid uh okay well why are you delayed  on this well you know covid it's coveted  times right and so it's been really easy
lOBaA9zg3XM,903360,909279,to string us along and string us along  and just  not deliver
lOBaA9zg3XM,909279,914560,and so  so basically the contract doesn't have a
lOBaA9zg3XM,914560,921760,drop dead date for delivery  and that means that they can drag it out  for as long as they want so if they if
lOBaA9zg3XM,921760,926959,they were to drag it out for another  let's say three months right if they  dragged it out another three months
lOBaA9zg3XM,926959,933360,a we have no recourse and b that is  three months that we are not selling  screwdrivers
lOBaA9zg3XM,933360,938800,and when you're ordering a hundred  thousand screwdrivers which is what  we're doing like we're betting really
lOBaA9zg3XM,938800,944160,big on this we think it's a great  product we think you guys are going to  love it  um
lOBaA9zg3XM,944160,949199,you got to kind of make tough decisions  sometimes where you go okay 140 grand
lOBaA9zg3XM,949199,956639,that's a lot of money  but it's also  a dollar forty per screwdriver
lOBaA9zg3XM,956639,963279,can i absorb a dollar forty per  screwdriver  in the interest of actually having
lOBaA9zg3XM,963279,969920,product  to sell  so that's basically kind of kind of
lOBaA9zg3XM,969920,976240,where we're at on this i mean we're  we're lucky right like we're we're we're  i don't think there's a word for it
lOBaA9zg3XM,976240,981279,other than other than blessed right like  you guys  are what make this possible it's the
lOBaA9zg3XM,981279,987360,it's the video business that gives us  the ability to weather a storm that i  think would
lOBaA9zg3XM,987360,992480,sink  a lot of other startups right i mean  you've seen it time and time again with
lOBaA9zg3XM,992480,999920,things like kickstarters right where  something unforeseen will happen like a  supplier will screw them over or it'll
lOBaA9zg3XM,999920,1005600,get delayed due to factors outside of  their control and they go from hey we're  definitely going to deliver this thing
lOBaA9zg3XM,1005600,1011920,to  omg um well the ones with integrity  anyway omg we're gonna we need to return
lOBaA9zg3XM,1011920,1017440,everything right like it's it's tough  so we're we're really lucky that we have
lOBaA9zg3XM,1017440,1024480,you guys uh you know whether it's the  supporters on floatplane out there  whether it's  those folks that are picking up the
lOBaA9zg3XM,1024480,1032000,merch on lttstore.com  uh anyone who just even watches the  video you know that that's a huge huge
lOBaA9zg3XM,1032000,1038480,factor for us just watch the video like  we don't we don't have a favorite way to  support us really
lOBaA9zg3XM,1038480,1043839,it's just uh we just really appreciate  y'all so  sorry i realize i'm getting i'm getting
lOBaA9zg3XM,1043839,1051200,a little off topic i'm getting a little  sentimental here i could talk about the  computer uh we went with the uh
lOBaA9zg3XM,1051200,1057520,meshify c  and the reason we chose the meshify c  was at about a hundred bucks it's a
lOBaA9zg3XM,1057520,1065600,really great value for a case that has  solid cooling so the entire front is  mesh hence the name the top is mesh the
lOBaA9zg3XM,1065600,1073440,back is well it's not mesh but it's you  know honeycomb punch outs  so for a budget case great cooling and
lOBaA9zg3XM,1073440,1080720,unlike the meshify 2 it's quite  affordable so it's around 100  which we thought was a good fit for a
lOBaA9zg3XM,1080720,1086559,system like this obviously we could have  spent less you can always you can always  cheap out more on your case and if the
lOBaA9zg3XM,1086559,1093440,cooling's not good  hey  that's an easy fix  oh well okay uh fan filter for the
lOBaA9zg3XM,1093440,1100080,bottom ah  there you go  cooling  right like if you
lOBaA9zg3XM,1100080,1106160,if you're really trying to save a buck  you know you look at um scrapyard wars  right that series that we used to do
lOBaA9zg3XM,1106160,1111520,back when you could buy hardware on the  second hand market affordably you look  at scrapyard wars you know we would
lOBaA9zg3XM,1111520,1119440,almost never pay for a case if we could  avoid it right because all you need is  to strap your strap your parts into uh
lOBaA9zg3XM,1119440,1126240,you know an emi safe enclosure i mean  it's not even emi safe if you're gonna  pop the side panels off okay you need to
lOBaA9zg3XM,1126240,1132320,strap them somewhere securely where your  cat's not gonna knock it over  and you know that's all you really
lOBaA9zg3XM,1132320,1138640,need  right  but i think most people when they when  they you know treat themselves right
lOBaA9zg3XM,1138640,1144559,treat themselves to a new gaming rig  they want you know they want something  they can be proud of they want something  that looks decent and i i think the mesh
lOBaA9zg3XM,1144559,1150880,feisty is a pretty good balance there  where you're getting it for an  affordable price but you're also you
lOBaA9zg3XM,1150880,1157840,know building something that you can be  proud of and something you can carry  forward that's another thing that i  think people
lOBaA9zg3XM,1157840,1164080,sometimes don't consider  is it's really tempting to spend a ton  of money buy a brand new cpu brand new
lOBaA9zg3XM,1164080,1170720,gpu i mean especially before not so much  these days but it's really tempting to  buy a brand new cpu you know get a ton
lOBaA9zg3XM,1170720,1177039,of ram and then cheap out on something  like a case and  something that i think people sometimes
lOBaA9zg3XM,1177039,1182400,forget about is that the depreciation  on something like a cpu or computer
lOBaA9zg3XM,1182400,1187679,memory is often  markedly higher than on something like a
lOBaA9zg3XM,1187679,1192720,quality case in fact there are quality  cases from many years ago that if kept
lOBaA9zg3XM,1192720,1198960,in good condition can still hold their  value very well today because  fundamentally the standards have not
lOBaA9zg3XM,1198960,1204799,really changed we get new features we  get cable management holes that are  better laid out for modern boards or we
lOBaA9zg3XM,1204799,1210480,get front i o that's more up to date but  when it comes to quality construction in
lOBaA9zg3XM,1210480,1216159,some cases you can find cases from 10 15  years ago that are frankly built a lot  better than the ones today
lOBaA9zg3XM,1216159,1221679,meshviz has some nice features speaking  of features so we've got this little  nubbin in the middle that makes it so  that
lOBaA9zg3XM,1221679,1227760,installing the motherboard vertically is  super easy you just basically pop it in  there and then between the kind of
lOBaA9zg3XM,1227760,1234240,spring tension of the i o shield which  we installed earlier and this nubbin  it'll just kind of sit there now this is
lOBaA9zg3XM,1234240,1242159,a really important sanity check that i  i would say i always do but
lOBaA9zg3XM,1242159,1248400,no matter how many pcs i build  occasionally i'll forget to double check  it but you want to do a quick sanity
lOBaA9zg3XM,1248400,1254159,check make sure none of the little metal  nubbins are sticking into any of your  ports because that requires a full board
lOBaA9zg3XM,1254159,1259440,removal  and reinstall if you want to fix it  properly i've had situations where i was
lOBaA9zg3XM,1259440,1266000,just building for myself and i did  not feel like fixing it properly so i've  just taken a pair of side cutters you
lOBaA9zg3XM,1266000,1271919,get in there and like  rip out the tabs david  don't don't say that like you've never
lOBaA9zg3XM,1271919,1275759,done it no i was going to say we're like  brothers
lOBaA9zg3XM,1278559,1284720,i've done it oh yeah where can we find  all these parts so everything that we're  building with today from micro center in
lOBaA9zg3XM,1284720,1291039,fact i uh my phone's over there but i  have the what's the uh what's the master  5c going for right now 100 bucks 100
lOBaA9zg3XM,1291039,1298480,bucks at micro center  25 locations across the u.s  good freaking stuff we're using our 632
lOBaA9zg3XM,1298480,1304760,threaded screws here getting this  motherboard all screwed in
lOBaA9zg3XM,1306880,1311919,uh floatplane wants me to remind flo  plane you know you guys pay me not the
lOBaA9zg3XM,1311919,1317039,other way around right like uh you don't  work from for for me but they asked me
lOBaA9zg3XM,1317039,1324480,to remind everyone that merch messages  are a thing so when we are live if you  go on lttstore.com and
lOBaA9zg3XM,1324480,1329520,uh place an order  there will be a little message that  comes up in the middle of the frame that
lOBaA9zg3XM,1329520,1334559,will show your message unless it's  something that requires a direct  response or unless you write something
lOBaA9zg3XM,1334559,1340720,inappropriate in which case it will it  will not show up there but that's what  we do instead of super chats now because
lOBaA9zg3XM,1340720,1346480,we really felt like super chats were not  doing proper service to our audience
lOBaA9zg3XM,1346480,1351520,they're great in theory right they're a  way for people to  spend money so that they can have like a
lOBaA9zg3XM,1351520,1357280,highlighted message and the creator can  respond to them but the problem is that  so many would come in especially ones
lOBaA9zg3XM,1357280,1362799,that  frankly we're not  quality uh that we can't acknowledge
lOBaA9zg3XM,1362799,1368159,them all and what's frustrating about  that for me is it means that i really  feel like i've you know i've let the
lOBaA9zg3XM,1368159,1373840,audience down because  you know either it's something that's  not entertaining for me to talk about on
lOBaA9zg3XM,1373840,1380799,the stream or someone says something  inappropriate i can't acknowledge it and  then i feel like people have spent  real actual money for
lOBaA9zg3XM,1380799,1387280,nothing  so with merch messages what's great  about that is if for whatever reason i  don't acknowledge your message
lOBaA9zg3XM,1387280,1393360,at least you get your ltt merch in the  mail  you know a couple days later or a couple
lOBaA9zg3XM,1393360,1399919,weeks later depending where you happen  to be in the world  so i don't have to i don't have to sit  and feel guilty if i don't manage to
lOBaA9zg3XM,1399919,1406480,respond to every single one of them i  also feel like it's just better bang for  the buck because then if we do  acknowledge it then it's effectively
lOBaA9zg3XM,1406480,1411600,everything you would have gotten out of  a super chat plus we get the little  image coming down on the screen so if
lOBaA9zg3XM,1411600,1418320,you wanted to do like a you know a high  mom because you think your mom watches  ltt for whatever reason
lOBaA9zg3XM,1418320,1424159,if you wanted to do you know a high mom  or whatever  then you can totally do that
lOBaA9zg3XM,1424159,1432480,okay let's get our power supply  installed this  was really a budget um
lOBaA9zg3XM,1432480,1438240,a budget driven decision so we went with  the g-skill mb650b power supply it ain't
lOBaA9zg3XM,1438240,1445200,the most efficient thing it don't have  the most features you know you got a  simple stamped steel
lOBaA9zg3XM,1445200,1452000,grille you know nothing nothing really  nothing really outstanding but what it  is is decent power supply and it's like
lOBaA9zg3XM,1452000,1458960,90 bucks  80 plus bronze again you know nothing  nothing crazy in terms of efficiency but
lOBaA9zg3XM,1458960,1466000,it is semi-modular  oh hold on got that oriented wrong
lOBaA9zg3XM,1466000,1473279,so we're going to go ahead and install  this this is actually a feature that i  really like even though it can whoops
lOBaA9zg3XM,1473279,1478799,add some finickiness to the installation  processor the processor installation  process these little
lOBaA9zg3XM,1478799,1484400,power supply frame pieces here  because what you're supposed to do is
lOBaA9zg3XM,1484400,1490400,you're  you're supposed to not be a dum-dum it  makes it easy to slide the power supply  in from the back and it's a lot easier
lOBaA9zg3XM,1490400,1496320,to do this if you just pull the whole  thing out  now where's my lap i need my laptop so i
lOBaA9zg3XM,1496320,1502799,can so i can talk to you i'll actually  pull further any merge messages that i  should be acknowledging
lOBaA9zg3XM,1503360,1511120,they bought something but they didn't  send a message oh boy  okay we are actually working on
lOBaA9zg3XM,1511120,1516240,a way to make the merch message box a  little bit more intuitive but it's like  in the checkout
lOBaA9zg3XM,1516240,1522240,we're working on a way to make it kind  of stand out better  there we go
lOBaA9zg3XM,1523600,1529640,the fractal manager is watching  oh okay
lOBaA9zg3XM,1533520,1539760,they're gonna be judging me oh okay well  that's uh  that's a little uncomfortable
lOBaA9zg3XM,1539760,1545360,one thing i would have liked even on a  budget power supply is sleeved cables  but
lOBaA9zg3XM,1545360,1550480,hopefully we can cable manage it tightly  enough that it's not really going to be  a factor here so you can see our
lOBaA9zg3XM,1550480,1557760,pre-attached ones are your 24 pin power  for the motherboard as well as dual  eight pin cpu power connectors this is
lOBaA9zg3XM,1557760,1564480,something that's always been kind of  confusing to me  if  these wires can carry all the power that
lOBaA9zg3XM,1564480,1570640,you need for two eight pins or an eight  and a four so you can break this one  apart
lOBaA9zg3XM,1570640,1576240,why don't you just do it all through the  one and i know i know the answer the  answer is that the spec
lOBaA9zg3XM,1576240,1582640,is that you can only put i forget how  many  like 150 watts or something like that i
lOBaA9zg3XM,1582640,1588720,forget what the actual number is but the  spec is that you can only put so much  through one of these connections
lOBaA9zg3XM,1588720,1594240,but in that case then you should be  running two separate wires and
lOBaA9zg3XM,1594240,1600640,there are cases where it can make a  slight difference so i think gamersnexus  did a video where they measured the
lOBaA9zg3XM,1600640,1605840,temperature of the wires running two  separate connections to a gpu versus one
lOBaA9zg3XM,1605840,1612400,daisy chain one and it was lower if you  run two separate ones but it's also not
lOBaA9zg3XM,1612400,1619039,going to light a fire in either case so  it seems like kind of just a  a minor thing and clearly everyone just
lOBaA9zg3XM,1619039,1626240,treats it like it doesn't really matter  so  it wasn't really going anywhere with  this but let's get our 24 pin plugged in
lOBaA9zg3XM,1626240,1632960,here  oh man this takes me back the classic  ketchup mustard
lOBaA9zg3XM,1632960,1640159,cable color  look at that  i actually kind of like building basic  machines because it just goes so fast
lOBaA9zg3XM,1640159,1647760,it's relatively simple we've already got  our cpu our memory did i even talk about  our memory oh man yeah so we've got uh
lOBaA9zg3XM,1647760,1653440,3600 c c18  it's a dual 8 gig kit so it runs in dual
lOBaA9zg3XM,1653440,1660399,channel it's from g-skill it's their rip  jaws v or rip jaws 5 whatever you prefer
lOBaA9zg3XM,1660399,1667919,these are xmp compatible modules so if  you want to do any overclocking i think  amd calls it docp or whatever the case
lOBaA9zg3XM,1667919,1674080,may be  3600 cl18 that's a really nice sweet  spot to be for amd it's either that or
lOBaA9zg3XM,1674080,1681279,like 3 200 mega transfers per second  with really low latencies do you want to  do like a cl like 16 cl 14 kit or
lOBaA9zg3XM,1681279,1686399,something like that that's  really the sweet spot for amd builds
lOBaA9zg3XM,1686399,1688799,all right
lOBaA9zg3XM,1692480,1697760,i said we'd talk about this  to all the haters out there that are  like oh
lOBaA9zg3XM,1697760,1702640,why are they doing a build with the 6500  x2
lOBaA9zg3XM,1703120,1708159,the honest truth okay the deities honest  truth
lOBaA9zg3XM,1708159,1716320,is that we planned to do this build okay  we planned to do a build with micro  center before we had our hands on this
lOBaA9zg3XM,1716320,1722880,gpu before we had tested it before we  had any opportunity to know  how things were going to shake out
lOBaA9zg3XM,1722880,1729440,so  we hedged our bets we said look  we are we got a hankering right like
lOBaA9zg3XM,1729440,1736080,we're getting the shakes  we haven't done a budget build in over a  year  we want to do a budget build and they
lOBaA9zg3XM,1736080,1741679,went okay well we're micro center we've  got 25 locations with tens of thousands
lOBaA9zg3XM,1741679,1747600,of products in stock and great prices  we got you covered you want to do a  budget build and we went well yeah but
lOBaA9zg3XM,1747600,1754240,like  gpus  okay maybe the 6500 xt will be our
lOBaA9zg3XM,1754240,1759039,savior we said  maybe it will
lOBaA9zg3XM,1760480,1766480,thankfully we hedged our bets so now is  the part of this stream where you guys
lOBaA9zg3XM,1766480,1773200,are going to decide  do we stick with our 5600g with on-board  graphics we did choose a motherboard
lOBaA9zg3XM,1773200,1778559,that  has hdmi and displayport out for our  onboard gpu oh yeah i guess we didn't
lOBaA9zg3XM,1778559,1784960,really talk about the rest of the i o  that's the nice thing about getting a  nice mid-range board you got that usb 10  gigabit per second two and a half gig
lOBaA9zg3XM,1784960,1791600,lan got that nice bios flashback that's  a really important feature for amd  boards just you never know right like
lOBaA9zg3XM,1791600,1797039,maybe you're selling it down the road  and you sell the cpu first and you have  a buyer who has a 2000 series chip or
lOBaA9zg3XM,1797039,1804799,something like that you want to  make sure they want to test it make sure  it's compatible boom bios flashback  really really nice feature to have
lOBaA9zg3XM,1804880,1810799,so  we went with a cpu that has a gpu on  board just in case the 6500xt turned out
lOBaA9zg3XM,1810799,1818399,to be a turd  and it did so you guys are going to  decide  do we go with the cpu which has seven
lOBaA9zg3XM,1818399,1824240,cus like decent onboard graphics we can  we can fire it up we've got peripherals  and a monitor and all that good stuff
lOBaA9zg3XM,1824240,1830880,or do you want us to install our 6500 xt  and i'm going to grab my laptop i'm  going to go through the chat but before
lOBaA9zg3XM,1830880,1836399,i do that i want to talk about some of  the reasons that the 6500 xt is such a  dog so
lOBaA9zg3XM,1836399,1843360,whether it was to save a buck or whether  it was to make the card less appealing  to miners amd equipped this bad boy with
lOBaA9zg3XM,1843360,1850679,only four gigs of video memory and a  64-bit memory bus
lOBaA9zg3XM,1850679,1857039,64-bit bus to put that in perspective i  mean what is that even comparable to
lOBaA9zg3XM,1857039,1862720,like a gt-1030  does a 1030 have a 64-bit bus i think so
lOBaA9zg3XM,1862720,1869760,i mean even going back many many years  64-bit memory bus is like the mark
lOBaA9zg3XM,1869760,1875600,of a budget card even going back like 10  15 years  and
lOBaA9zg3XM,1875600,1881200,a gpu needs high speed memory i mean  even budget gpus need high speed memory
lOBaA9zg3XM,1881200,1886519,nvidia famously has two versions of the  gt1030 they've got the
lOBaA9zg3XM,1886519,1893120,gddr5 version i think it is and then  they've got one that's got like regular  ddr4 on it or something like that i
lOBaA9zg3XM,1893120,1900000,can't remember exactly what two  technologies they use but one of them is  has much slower ram and even with a
lOBaA9zg3XM,1900000,1906640,basic gpu like a gt 1030 it makes an  enormous difference and effectively
lOBaA9zg3XM,1906640,1912720,equipping the card with a much narrower  communication bus between the gpu and  the memory
lOBaA9zg3XM,1912720,1918840,it's like equipping it with much slower  or um much crappier memory
lOBaA9zg3XM,1918840,1925679,essentially um  the good news  is that you can actually buy them near
lOBaA9zg3XM,1925679,1931360,msrp msrp is 200 and unfortunately you  can't get them for 200  and they didn't even get reviewed well
lOBaA9zg3XM,1931360,1936720,at 200 because the performance is not  very good but you can get them for 200
lOBaA9zg3XM,1936720,1942559,and change  and it is a dedicated gpu that you can  actually buy
lOBaA9zg3XM,1942559,1947919,brand new off the shelf so that's sort  of the glass half full  but unfortunately we've got a bit of a
lOBaA9zg3XM,1947919,1955519,configuration error in our system if we  even wanted to get the most out of this  thing because it's a pcie gen
lOBaA9zg3XM,1955519,1961840,4 gpu which sounds like high technology  see look at
lOBaA9zg3XM,1961840,1968880,1080p  full hd gaming 4 gigs gddr6  64-bit bus
lOBaA9zg3XM,1968880,1976399,pcie 4.0  but the problem is that you really got  to dig into the fine print here
lOBaA9zg3XM,1976399,1983919,to find  uh where they crippled that 4.0  interface okay no pcie 4.0 support
lOBaA9zg3XM,1983919,1990640,so it's not there  minimum system requirements pci express  compatible motherboard with one x16 pcie
lOBaA9zg3XM,1990640,1996720,slot  nope they didn't disclose it there in  fact they just don't even mention
lOBaA9zg3XM,1996720,2003519,that that pcie 4.0 interface is only is  it by eight or by four
lOBaA9zg3XM,2003519,2008960,but it is a 64 bit on the 10 30. yeah  the 1030 is 64 bit uh i can't remember
lOBaA9zg3XM,2008960,2014799,actually if it's uh  by four by eight hold on i can probably  tell by
lOBaA9zg3XM,2014799,2019840,popping this out  quick blue
lOBaA9zg3XM,2019840,2025360,i think it's by four  so let's talk again about
lOBaA9zg3XM,2025360,2031039,wider communication  buses  i i get a kick out of this
lOBaA9zg3XM,2031039,2037519,even on the card itself physically it's  like kind of deceptive hold on ah
lOBaA9zg3XM,2037519,2043360,get  by four yeah that's right okay ah come  on
lOBaA9zg3XM,2043360,2048720,get out of there okay  even the card itself is quite deceptive  there's no way as an average consumer
lOBaA9zg3XM,2048720,2054398,that you could know that this  16x interface here with all of these
lOBaA9zg3XM,2054398,2060480,connections you see all that  there you go this is the only way you  can tell david can you get close enough
lOBaA9zg3XM,2060480,2066079,to see that on the board on the pcb  only these ones are actually connected
lOBaA9zg3XM,2066079,2071760,to anything  and the rest of it's just blank  that's right
lOBaA9zg3XM,2071760,2078560,it's pcie gen 4  gddr6 but it has a pcie gen 4x4
lOBaA9zg3XM,2078560,2085760,interface  the standard for gpus is by 16  and pci express bandwidth scales
lOBaA9zg3XM,2085760,2092079,linearly with the number of lanes so  gen 4 means double the bandwidth of gen
lOBaA9zg3XM,2092079,2097118,3 which is double the bandwidth of gen  2.  but the problem with that
lOBaA9zg3XM,2097118,2102720,is that  if you only have four of those gen 4  lanes
lOBaA9zg3XM,2102720,2108160,compared to if you had  16 gen 2 lanes
lOBaA9zg3XM,2108160,2114480,they're now equivalent  so this essentially  has a pci express
lOBaA9zg3XM,2114480,2120880,gen 2 by 16 interface you could think of  it that way  but it's even worse than that
lOBaA9zg3XM,2120880,2128240,because if it had a pci express gen 2 by  16 interface then it would operate at  full speed in this motherboard with this
lOBaA9zg3XM,2128240,2136400,cpu  unfortunately this cpu only supports pci  express gen 3. and that's true of most
lOBaA9zg3XM,2136400,2143280,budget cpus that are in the kinds of  systems that people would build around  something like a 5600 xt
lOBaA9zg3XM,2143280,2149280,actually amd doesn't even list pci this  is why this is so confusing for  consumers
lOBaA9zg3XM,2149280,2156160,they don't even list  what generation of pcie and how many  lanes on the box because i you know it'd
lOBaA9zg3XM,2156160,2161280,be a shame to scare people away with  too many actual meaningful specs right
lOBaA9zg3XM,2161280,2167280,you don't want to confuse the customer  so if it had
lOBaA9zg3XM,2167760,2174000,a gen 2 by 16  slot on the card this cpu would be able  to communicate at full speed but because
lOBaA9zg3XM,2174000,2180960,this cpu only supports gen 3 and there's  only four lanes now instead of gen 4
lOBaA9zg3XM,2180960,2187440,by 4  right  we're running it gen 3  by 4 because all those other pins are
lOBaA9zg3XM,2187440,2192960,not freaking connected  so this is the same  if you plug it into a budget system this
lOBaA9zg3XM,2192960,2198720,is the same as connecting your gpu on  pci express gen 2
lOBaA9zg3XM,2198720,2204960,by eight  okay for those of you who like didn't
lOBaA9zg3XM,2204960,2210079,follow all the doubling and halving of  of bandwidth and all of that stuff
lOBaA9zg3XM,2210079,2216320,that's the like  moment because basically if you plug
lOBaA9zg3XM,2216320,2221760,this card into the kind of system that  we would expect it to be plugged into  it has
lOBaA9zg3XM,2221760,2229280,one  eighth  of the interface bandwidth  that a modern gpu would have
lOBaA9zg3XM,2229280,2234480,one  eighth  that's bad
lOBaA9zg3XM,2234480,2241760,now if you plug it into a super modern  system because you're just using it as a  stopgap solution while you you know
lOBaA9zg3XM,2241760,2247440,optimistically wait for some better gpu  to come down in price  you know what yeah
lOBaA9zg3XM,2247440,2253760,fair enough it might be it might be  better than what you can get an older  scalp gpu for quite honestly i
lOBaA9zg3XM,2253760,2260560,i haven't looked at the used market  super closely in the last couple of days  i find it frankly kind of depressing so
lOBaA9zg3XM,2260560,2265599,i don't look at it every day it's only  really when we do a video that's really  focused on that and anthony was the one
lOBaA9zg3XM,2265599,2271838,who did all the prep for 6500 xt so i  had no reason to really look at it  yesterday
lOBaA9zg3XM,2272720,2278560,so it's possible that it could be a  better deal than whatever you could find  used especially because you know it  comes with a warranty and all that good
lOBaA9zg3XM,2278560,2284880,stuff  but if you're buying it just to just to  use to have and to hold
lOBaA9zg3XM,2284880,2290000,man it's tough  it's tough to recommend  so we're putting it in
lOBaA9zg3XM,2290000,2296320,but i need to pull right i said i'd pull  out the chat and let you guys ultimately  decide what you want to see do we just
lOBaA9zg3XM,2296320,2301760,stick with onboard graphics do we try to  wait out these scalper bastards or do we
lOBaA9zg3XM,2301760,2308000,go with the gpu  hi you guys how you guys doing hey guys  i'm you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna
lOBaA9zg3XM,2308000,2314000,put the chat right here i'm gonna put  chat right here while we go ahead and  cable manage this bad boy uh what else
lOBaA9zg3XM,2314000,2320560,is there for us to put in here is that  is that it we built the whole system  already put that gpu in there
lOBaA9zg3XM,2320560,2326800,is that it oh yeah i guess i can uh oh  hold on a second yeah let's uh let's do  that let's talk about talk about
lOBaA9zg3XM,2326800,2333119,microcenter some more  but  are you doing the thing  all right thanks microcenter for
lOBaA9zg3XM,2333119,2339280,sponsoring today's stream the  microcenter community is a great place  to go to get tech advice from other  enthusiasts you can check out the

lOBaA9zg3XM,2363599,2369599,showcase will also be sent a micro  center coupon all right cool stuff  freaking love it and of course they're

lOBaA9zg3XM,2375119,2381280,so that promo has actually been running  for quite some time those guys are tough  to compete with i tell you that i was i
lOBaA9zg3XM,2381280,2387280,was glad back when i was working at ncix  we were always very grateful that  microcenter did not exist north of the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2387280,2392800,border because we would look at the kind  of crazy stuff they would do back then  one of their big shticks back in the day
lOBaA9zg3XM,2392800,2397839,was they would just  beat the crap out of whatever the hot
lOBaA9zg3XM,2397839,2405920,intel cpu was of the day like they'd  just sell it like  way below cost as as a way to get people
lOBaA9zg3XM,2405920,2412480,to to come through the door and we were  just looking at it going on the one hand  we feel like we have to respond to this
lOBaA9zg3XM,2412480,2419200,because it generates a ton of complaints  for us that you know oh ncix is so  overpriced in the u.s you could get the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2419200,2424480,cpu for this much at micro center but  you know we know what their cost is and  we know that they're just selling it
lOBaA9zg3XM,2424480,2430240,like 80 dollars below cost like we don't  we can't  we can't compete with that
lOBaA9zg3XM,2430240,2438240,um  so they've always just had kind of these  crazy  these crazy promos and uh i i mean hey
lOBaA9zg3XM,2438240,2445040,they outlasted their competition they  outlasted fries not lasted ncix  so clearly they're making it work for
lOBaA9zg3XM,2445040,2453160,them but i was just always very grateful  as a product manager that i didn't have  to beat their promos
lOBaA9zg3XM,2453280,2461200,all right how you guys doing chad hey  the electric electro classic says hi  floatplane heck yeah hi electro classic
lOBaA9zg3XM,2461200,2466560,they see the screen yeah yeah yeah i  think it's okay if they see the screen i  mean if they're yeah it's just it's just
lOBaA9zg3XM,2466560,2472079,all the chats i got the  got the dashboard up there no no the  laptop's not gonna fall guys it's all
lOBaA9zg3XM,2472079,2477680,good don't you even worry about a thing  i would never drop my framework laptop
lOBaA9zg3XM,2477680,2483839,okay what is happening here oh wow  wait what  okay  trying to feed these front panel
lOBaA9zg3XM,2483839,2489440,connector wires  man it's nice what you can get in a  budget case these days like cable
lOBaA9zg3XM,2489440,2495040,management in this thing yeah okay the  gpu that's pretty tough but that comes  more down to the fact that this
lOBaA9zg3XM,2495040,2502240,particular gpu has the power connector  right here in the middle because it's  got a donger extension cooler on it
lOBaA9zg3XM,2502240,2510880,actually i haven't used that term in a  long time i coined it back in the i  think  uh gtx 600 series days when nvidia did
lOBaA9zg3XM,2510880,2517440,that card that had a super short pcb  like they did a reference card or i  guess we call it a founder's card now
lOBaA9zg3XM,2517440,2522480,but they did a reference card back then  that had this like plastic extension to
lOBaA9zg3XM,2522480,2527760,make it look like a real man's gpu  but actually it was like a little little
lOBaA9zg3XM,2527760,2534160,tiny thing like this and it was just  like plastic at the end and i kind of  went  hey all the cooling and all the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2534160,2539200,card is here you could have just made it  shorter and then it would be  really great for small form factor
lOBaA9zg3XM,2539200,2545440,builds um  but i can see how from a customer  perception standpoint
lOBaA9zg3XM,2545440,2551440,seeming budget like that might not be  desirable so i guess they decided to go  the other route
lOBaA9zg3XM,2551440,2556960,so we're back to that again if you look  closely at this thing  at the back of it instead of at the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2556960,2562480,front of it  you can see that actually you know what  it has cooling over here not that it  probably needs it
lOBaA9zg3XM,2562480,2569040,it has cooling over here but the pcb  only actually goes up to here so that's  why the power connector has to be has to
lOBaA9zg3XM,2569040,2575040,be there all right i'm just plugging in  the front panel connectors here got  always remember positive on the left
lOBaA9zg3XM,2575040,2580960,and  um power led is almost always on the  same plane as the power switch
lOBaA9zg3XM,2580960,2588000,that's some of the easy little rules of  thumb that i can remember most modern  decent boards like this one have the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2588000,2593119,the key for it silk screened onto the  board so you don't even have to pull up  the manual which is really nice look at
lOBaA9zg3XM,2593119,2598480,that  i mean that's not bad in terms of man  this is really awful okay
lOBaA9zg3XM,2598480,2603760,look i'm trying here should i just go  get a cable mod extension or something
lOBaA9zg3XM,2603920,2609839,that's okay yeah extension it doesn't  matter it doesn't matter it's okay it's  just yet another reason for us to just
lOBaA9zg3XM,2609839,2619520,pull this horrible horrible gpu out uh  dan ed 33 asks ltt store panties when
lOBaA9zg3XM,2619520,2626960,okay  i had a meeting with the merch team  yesterday okay meeting with the merch  team yesterday i was talking with our
lOBaA9zg3XM,2626960,2632560,resident panty experts  who are  well look what do you want from me
lOBaA9zg3XM,2632560,2638480,they're the they're the fashion and  graphic design team okay  it was kind of a funny meeting i guess
lOBaA9zg3XM,2638480,2644720,because i had to ask a lot of questions  that are frankly things i've just  never really thought about not because
lOBaA9zg3XM,2644720,2649920,i'm like trying to pry but just because  i do need to know the answers to these
lOBaA9zg3XM,2649920,2655920,questions in order for us to make  good product development decisions i was  like
lOBaA9zg3XM,2655920,2664000,so are these kinds of underwear  comfortable  or you know  like are these are these popular do
lOBaA9zg3XM,2664000,2670240,people want uh do people want a bra that  doesn't have a wire
lOBaA9zg3XM,2670400,2677599,is that okay and it's just like can i  ask these questions this is not this is  not an hr issue right
lOBaA9zg3XM,2677599,2683839,just like  how do you navigate that sort of thing  anyway  we made it through it
lOBaA9zg3XM,2683839,2690720,and uh bridget and sarah each put  together designs that  quite frankly um we're gonna go from
lOBaA9zg3XM,2690720,2695760,making  no women's underwear  to making maybe too many women's
lOBaA9zg3XM,2695760,2703200,underwear because  they ended up both putting together  designs that they asked me to pick
lOBaA9zg3XM,2703200,2708640,because it seems like between sdi cable  is kind of given out oh okay  hi guys uh chase can you zoom out on the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2708640,2714400,overhead  uh you know what i'm just gonna be  unboxing these  i'm gonna be unboxing these peripherals
lOBaA9zg3XM,2714400,2720240,right now anyway so  let's get our keyboard this is a 30  dollar aukey keyboard which has their
lOBaA9zg3XM,2720240,2726160,red mechanical switches  uh we don't  know if it's amazing or anything but we
lOBaA9zg3XM,2726160,2733280,picked it up because it seemed like  pretty good price for  mechanical switch keyboard 30 bucks i
lOBaA9zg3XM,2733280,2739040,mean it's just there's some deck flex  but not the end of the world for our  mouse no compromises man if you're a
lOBaA9zg3XM,2739040,2744640,gamer  uh  you you can get away with a cheap  keyboard as long as it has a decent
lOBaA9zg3XM,2744640,2750960,number of key rollover  you cannot get away with a cheap mouse  if you want to get past a certain point
lOBaA9zg3XM,2750960,2758160,so  inspired by our recent video  talking about why the chuff and heck
lOBaA9zg3XM,2758160,2764079,everybody keeps buying this mouse we've  gone with the g502 hero this thing  really is
lOBaA9zg3XM,2764079,2770319,outstanding it's a great mouse even at  its original msrp and now it's even  better because you can get this bad boy
lOBaA9zg3XM,2770319,2776079,for like microcenter has it for what 50  bucks for the hero edition here um
lOBaA9zg3XM,2776079,2782400,so we're going to go ahead and get that  plugged in am i back on the on the a cam  not yet  that's fine because i've got a monitor
lOBaA9zg3XM,2782400,2788640,to unbox as well  oh right what i was going to say was if  anyone from the merch team is watching
lOBaA9zg3XM,2788640,2794400,uh nick like if if you're watching  maybe if those guys could get
lOBaA9zg3XM,2794400,2799520,uh  get chase  chase and undisclosed probationary
lOBaA9zg3XM,2799520,2804720,employee number three  if you guys could get them the mock-ups  for the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2804720,2809839,for the two underwear designs that would  be super cool  and then we could show them on stream if
lOBaA9zg3XM,2809839,2815760,you guys want to just send that over  hopefully someone's watching otherwise  uh ploof do you want to send them a
lOBaA9zg3XM,2815760,2822400,quick teams message  all right awesome  where did this garbage can go this is
lOBaA9zg3XM,2822400,2828400,this is frustrating me i need my garbage  can yeah whenever people move the  garbage can that's under the build
lOBaA9zg3XM,2828400,2834640,corner desk i get very  trey's upset  it's under you right now is it
lOBaA9zg3XM,2834640,2842880,oh fantastic look at that now i can  dispose of my garbage things thanks  number three yeah i appreciate that
lOBaA9zg3XM,2842880,2848880,all right and i just realized now i  forgot to plug in the front panel audio  and i haven't plugged in the fans yet  either so i went ahead and did that
lOBaA9zg3XM,2848880,2853920,let's get our monitor opened up  oh  this bad boy right here
lOBaA9zg3XM,2853920,2860480,msi optics  g241 so our rationale here was we were  looking for
lOBaA9zg3XM,2860480,2866240,something  affordable  but still with you know justifiability
lOBaA9zg3XM,2866240,2872880,as a as a as a gaming  display  so it's 144 hertz
lOBaA9zg3XM,2872880,2880480,1080p  one millisecond response times i believe  oh hold on
lOBaA9zg3XM,2880720,2887440,oh there's your problem i hate this  style of box uh which camera are we on  right now
lOBaA9zg3XM,2887440,2893839,they're on you oh okay  um  ow  i hate this style of box where the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2893839,2899280,the handles  they get punched in when you grab them  and then they lock in the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2899280,2905760,item come on i can't get it open  do you see the problem here like it it
lOBaA9zg3XM,2905760,2911440,punches in the thing and then you can  see when i try to lift it  it gets stuck on the
lOBaA9zg3XM,2911440,2917760,on the little cardboard tab ow  my finger
lOBaA9zg3XM,2917760,2923520,there we go  okay  looks like they thought of that it's got  a little it's got a little punch out in
lOBaA9zg3XM,2923520,2929440,the bottom there all right should be  able to get this open i believe this has  an ips type panel so you're not
lOBaA9zg3XM,2929440,2935440,going all the way back to the stone age  in terms of panel technology  let's go ahead and get this baby opened
lOBaA9zg3XM,2935440,2941680,up actually you know what i'm going to  recruit one of my special helpers to  assemble the monitor for me while i go
lOBaA9zg3XM,2941680,2948960,ahead and plug in the fans  do you think i could get a special  helper over here
lOBaA9zg3XM,2950079,2957040,oh you want to get the the bra and  panties up on the stream  priorities uh fair enough oh did sarah
lOBaA9zg3XM,2957040,2964160,send them over  nice what a champion she is  absolute champion you know what
lOBaA9zg3XM,2964160,2970559,maybe we'll have to let you guys weigh  in so if you wear if you wear like  women's style
lOBaA9zg3XM,2970559,2976079,um underwear or  if you  know someone who wears women's style
lOBaA9zg3XM,2976079,2981119,underwear maybe what you could do is  get those people in front of the stream
lOBaA9zg3XM,2981119,2987119,because we really do need the  community's feedback on this one  like i was saying before honestly
lOBaA9zg3XM,2987119,2993040,bridget and sarah both brought such  strong designs to the table that it's
lOBaA9zg3XM,2993040,2999119,i think impossible for us to pick just  one i think we kind of have to do both  of them but we also have to limit our
lOBaA9zg3XM,2999119,3005599,exposure  pun intended on this product because  we don't know how well it's going to
lOBaA9zg3XM,3005599,3011599,sell and we can't just go to market with  you know all the dozen different
lOBaA9zg3XM,3011599,3019040,freaking styles of underwear with all  the different you know amounts of  of butt they show or whatever else like
lOBaA9zg3XM,3019040,3025760,i we can't just do everything all at  once  so we need you guys to tell us hey
lOBaA9zg3XM,3025760,3031760,what should our priority be  um let me know when you guys have got  that up
lOBaA9zg3XM,3031760,3036960,i can  uh okay how's this going here
lOBaA9zg3XM,3039599,3046960,uh-oh  where's my screws at okay here we go  so some assembly required
lOBaA9zg3XM,3049920,3055920,it's always kind of fun to me to see  what the manufacturing date was on on  hardware that i buy from the store or it
lOBaA9zg3XM,3055920,3061760,comes from the store  this particular monitor made in 2021  september
lOBaA9zg3XM,3061760,3069440,so that gives you an idea of how long it  takes to go from factory to  sea shipment to msi's warehouse to their
lOBaA9zg3XM,3069440,3076000,partner to your door  and it turns out the answer is about two  to three months or three to four months
lOBaA9zg3XM,3076000,3082720,i guess that would work out too hey  there they are  okay  so according to bridget and sir oh
lOBaA9zg3XM,3082720,3090480,they're gone  they're still there according to bridget  and sarah these two styles of tops and
lOBaA9zg3XM,3090480,3097440,bottoms are quite popular right now we  don't want to try and tackle the  legitimate engineering challenges
lOBaA9zg3XM,3097440,3103920,associated with doing something like  a wire  bra or anything like that that's that's
lOBaA9zg3XM,3103920,3110240,that's a project for another time  but we've got  the pris i call it prism i don't
lOBaA9zg3XM,3110240,3116240,remember what bridget called it but it's  kind of like an rgb inspired design on  the left there
lOBaA9zg3XM,3116240,3122160,and then we've got  i don't know what to call this other  than like underwear party um
lOBaA9zg3XM,3122160,3129359,but sarah's design is the one on the  right and then they told me okay  scoop neck a scoop net bralette and then
lOBaA9zg3XM,3129359,3136079,a triangle bralette are super popular  and they said hey look if we're just  gonna do one we should probably do the
lOBaA9zg3XM,3136079,3142079,boy shorts for the bottoms  um but then  so the thing is like you know for me
lOBaA9zg3XM,3142079,3148640,these are not products that i use  personally so i just  i have to just ask people awkward  questions right so i was talking to my
lOBaA9zg3XM,3148640,3154079,wife about it really anyone who will who  will listen and who i think it would be  appropriate to ask
lOBaA9zg3XM,3154079,3160480,so i was talking to my wife about it and  she kind of goes look i have no interest  in the boy shorts whatsoever i would  really like for there to be a bikini
lOBaA9zg3XM,3160480,3167119,bottom  and so  i feel like we're going to kind of have  to do both but what i want to know is
lOBaA9zg3XM,3167119,3173440,how heavily should we skew one way or  the other when we place our order and  what do you guys think in terms of
lOBaA9zg3XM,3173440,3180160,designs  would you go for like i would imagine  the the like the tech you know party
lOBaA9zg3XM,3180160,3186000,underwear on the right i would imagine  that more in like a boy short versus a  bikini bottom like i'm i'm kind of
lOBaA9zg3XM,3186000,3192160,lounging around the house i guess  um  but
lOBaA9zg3XM,3192160,3198079,i don't i don't know i don't know this  is one of those situations where i'm  speaking entirely from from ignorance
lOBaA9zg3XM,3198079,3203760,and i just have to i gotta own that  and i just gotta listen to what what the
lOBaA9zg3XM,3203760,3209280,people who know tell me  all right plug in displayport here
lOBaA9zg3XM,3209280,3215440,and then i want to have a look at the  chat real quick actually i got to get my  i got to get my fans plugged in as well
lOBaA9zg3XM,3215440,3221040,that's the last thing left there  all right coming back around
lOBaA9zg3XM,3221040,3229040,uh a couple questions for merch message  okay i'm gonna have to wait for a sec  um  suit says my wife hates boy shorts
lOBaA9zg3XM,3229040,3234640,ah  [Music]  lisa  miza says  bikini
lOBaA9zg3XM,3234640,3241119,yeah  holy a word that i don't say on stream i
lOBaA9zg3XM,3241119,3246880,would 100  uh go underwear party would prefer scoop  brawl at bikini bottom see that was
lOBaA9zg3XM,3246880,3253200,another thing that i asked i was like  okay so  i know that mixing and matching with
lOBaA9zg3XM,3253200,3259280,uh with bathing suits is a thing but  would we would we be expected oh they're  not there anymore but would we be
lOBaA9zg3XM,3259280,3267280,expected to sell sets of these or would  we expect people to mix and match both  the patterns and the styles and
lOBaA9zg3XM,3267280,3274000,sarah and bridget both were immediately  like oh 100 mix and match and i go oh  shoot okay so now we have to figure out
lOBaA9zg3XM,3274000,3279599,like a new  picking and packing process for these  so that people can kind of customize
lOBaA9zg3XM,3279599,3290400,their their package so to speak  and yeah there's definitely going to be  challenges uh has rrl says boy shorts um
lOBaA9zg3XM,3290880,3296640,what else we got here  oh man  yeah mix and match yeah yeah yeah i i
lOBaA9zg3XM,3296640,3303200,hear you guys mix and match well the  thing is we don't want to sell them  individually like just individually  individually because
lOBaA9zg3XM,3303200,3309280,we're not amazon right like we we have  significant  picking and packing costs associated
lOBaA9zg3XM,3309280,3315920,with an order so we would never expect  someone to order a single pair of  underwear from us because by the time we
lOBaA9zg3XM,3315920,3322000,pay our overhead fees  it's just not going to be competitive  right like it's going to cost way too
lOBaA9zg3XM,3322000,3328880,much so we want to bundle things  together to make it a more worthwhile  value to make it not a waste of
lOBaA9zg3XM,3328880,3334480,everyone's time right  but what we want to figure out is how  you can choose your own bundle
lOBaA9zg3XM,3334480,3339839,so maybe we could just make it like  oh man i wonder if we could do something  as
lOBaA9zg3XM,3339839,3347680,we could do a top and a bottom for x  price we could do two tops two bottoms  for x price we could do something like
lOBaA9zg3XM,3347680,3355040,any two items or any three items for x  price there's  lots of different ways that we can
lOBaA9zg3XM,3355040,3361359,that we can  sort of tackle it  bikini in both for pad wearers okay yeah
lOBaA9zg3XM,3361359,3367520,fair enough  uh imagine  um  said the only thing she would wear if
lOBaA9zg3XM,3367520,3374880,any was top left okay so prefer the rgb  slash prism design in the
lOBaA9zg3XM,3374880,3380799,triangle triangle cut  uh bryce og86 asks could you do like a
lOBaA9zg3XM,3380799,3386079,men's style and women's style  in the same sort of pattern as a combo
lOBaA9zg3XM,3386079,3392160,i think that is absolutely something  that we should do  i don't know if that's the first thing
lOBaA9zg3XM,3392160,3397280,we want to do  but  yeah it's tough right because we have no
lOBaA9zg3XM,3397280,3403520,freaking idea how these are going to  sell  according to google our audience is two
lOBaA9zg3XM,3403520,3409040,percent or less than two percent female  but here's the problem with that right
lOBaA9zg3XM,3409040,3414720,a  they're guessing a lot of the time and i  think that um
lOBaA9zg3XM,3414720,3420480,machine learning algorithms are not  necessarily the greatest in terms of uh
lOBaA9zg3XM,3420480,3427200,inclusivity uh i think that they make a  lot of assumptions i think they are  prejudiced essentially so i think that
lOBaA9zg3XM,3427200,3433280,uh just an interest in tech  could get someone flagged as you know
lOBaA9zg3XM,3433280,3440400,middle age whatever in my analytics  dashboard but that might  not actually be what they are right so
lOBaA9zg3XM,3440400,3446160,that's one problem  another problem with just trusting the  analytics is that we get a ton of
lOBaA9zg3XM,3446160,3452640,feedback from people like  hey  my  wife and i my girlfriend and i
lOBaA9zg3XM,3452640,3458960,watch the wan show every week my  boyfriend and i my husband and i we  watch the lan show together every week
lOBaA9zg3XM,3458960,3466079,well what account are you logged into  right  so just because  did this turn off why is this off
lOBaA9zg3XM,3466079,3473599,yeah there you go just because that view  counted as a  male ages 18 to 35 view doesn't
lOBaA9zg3XM,3473599,3479280,necessarily  mean that that's the only person who was  watching  so those are the challenges that we have
lOBaA9zg3XM,3479280,3484480,we we just have google's sort of  uh prejudiced guesswork
lOBaA9zg3XM,3484480,3489920,and  that's about it because we've never  really done like a uh we don't really
lOBaA9zg3XM,3489920,3495520,have even a scientific way to pull our  audience  now um
lOBaA9zg3XM,3495520,3501599,is this broken  hold on  vga oh that's hilarious
lOBaA9zg3XM,3501599,3507520,it seems to be stalled on gpu  initialization  ow
lOBaA9zg3XM,3507520,3514559,yeah i'm good oh i just um oh  right in the funny bone i i was oh i was
lOBaA9zg3XM,3514559,3519839,trying i was trying to reach back and  grab my screwdriver  okay we're just gonna give this the old
lOBaA9zg3XM,3519839,3526960,did you try turning it off and turning  it back on again  dane232 says thanks for the update wifey
lOBaA9zg3XM,3526960,3533200,approves hey no problem  uh the millen says you have to take into  account people like me who will buy
lOBaA9zg3XM,3533200,3538799,gifts for their wife you know what  that's actually something that we have  thought about quite a bit
lOBaA9zg3XM,3538799,3545760,is  we want ltt to be a clothing brand not  just merch for people who watch the
lOBaA9zg3XM,3545760,3551040,channel and so one of the things that  we're trying to do is make sure that  everything's super high quality so that
lOBaA9zg3XM,3551040,3556640,people just inherently trust it so that  you buy you know men's underwear for  yourself and you kind of go hey i want
lOBaA9zg3XM,3556640,3562079,to get a gift for someone  that seems like a really cool design you  know what i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna get
lOBaA9zg3XM,3562079,3568319,them because i know they'll be like good  so  we are accounting for that there could
lOBaA9zg3XM,3568319,3573599,be a fair amount of gift are you serious  right now  this has now gone from a no post
lOBaA9zg3XM,3573599,3579200,situation  to a no  power on whatsoever situation
lOBaA9zg3XM,3579200,3587119,is our 6500 xt  more than just  a bad value is it actually causing our
lOBaA9zg3XM,3587119,3593119,system not to boot up  how funny would that be i mean it's not  really that funny
lOBaA9zg3XM,3593119,3599440,ah  okay rich 77 says here's the problem  with buying underwear for your lady you
lOBaA9zg3XM,3599440,3604640,would have to ask her size not an option  two you need to snoop to find your size  not better
lOBaA9zg3XM,3604640,3612079,i would say that if you are in a  relationship where you can't  open someone's underwear drawer you guys
lOBaA9zg3XM,3612079,3618319,got some you guys got some secrets  um  i i can tell you that not everybody is
lOBaA9zg3XM,3618319,3625520,in the same situation as you rich 77 i i  can i can  i mean i do the laundry in our house
lOBaA9zg3XM,3625520,3633760,there  volunteer to do the laundry boom easy  oh boy our 6500 xt might be dead
lOBaA9zg3XM,3633760,3640839,how funny is that i mean i'm glad the  system is um posted now that's the good  news that's the reassuring
lOBaA9zg3XM,3640839,3646400,part ah the part  yeah
lOBaA9zg3XM,3646400,3652640,uh huh this is this is a this is a  challenge uh it's okay david you don't  have to hold that thing up so high you
lOBaA9zg3XM,3652640,3660160,can i'll just be back here for a second  i just want to get the ethernet plugged  in and keyboard mouse plugged in and all  that good stuff
lOBaA9zg3XM,3660400,3668160,oh boy  oh boy okay let's turn it off let's plug
lOBaA9zg3XM,3668160,3675200,the gpu back in  and  see if that  oh man chat loves this yeah that gpu was
lOBaA9zg3XM,3675200,3680559,stillborn anyway yeah  i know but come on i'm trying to give it
lOBaA9zg3XM,3680559,3686720,i'm trying to give it a chance here guys  at least it's a gpu okay fine fine
lOBaA9zg3XM,3686720,3692640,from the tech enthusiast standpoint okay  like you guys me right  hey
lOBaA9zg3XM,3692640,3700960,if amd's um  maybe not deceptive but certainly  omissive marketing practices here work
lOBaA9zg3XM,3700960,3709280,and  other less tech savvy people go out and  buy this thing  that's one more gpu for us
lOBaA9zg3XM,3711920,3717680,look  david  i am trying to find a silver lining here
lOBaA9zg3XM,3717680,3723200,okay is that not a silver lining  i didn't say it was a
lOBaA9zg3XM,3723200,3728319,you know um  lawful good silver lining okay that's
lOBaA9zg3XM,3728319,3734880,just  i just said it's a silver lining okay
lOBaA9zg3XM,3737039,3742319,bad linus look i know but what do you  guys want from me look
lOBaA9zg3XM,3742319,3748160,i'm live so i can't take it back which  means that if the internet has taught me  anything
lOBaA9zg3XM,3748160,3756480,it's time to double down  matt has anyone done that as a web comic  yet like double down man
lOBaA9zg3XM,3756480,3765519,he says awful things and when he's  called on it he doesn't take it back he  doubles down that's his superpower
lOBaA9zg3XM,3766079,3773200,we only uh  yeah it's just not a very remarkable  superpower  it's a super normal normal superpower
lOBaA9zg3XM,3773200,3778240,creation tool you're gonna need that  windows media creation tool oh did we  not put windows on the drive
lOBaA9zg3XM,3778240,3784480,did we did we do a did we do a little  oopsie um well what i would actually  prefer then is can i just have the uh
lOBaA9zg3XM,3784480,3790400,the drive from my test bench upstairs  please  okay yeah it's uh it's just on the desk  behind my desk
lOBaA9zg3XM,3790400,3796880,i mean that's fine because i have to  troubleshoot this gpu right now anyway  this is ridiculous okay so did i
lOBaA9zg3XM,3796880,3802720,oh sorry about that david here you go uh  so did i maybe plug this into the wrong  spot or something like maybe it's not
lOBaA9zg3XM,3802720,3808160,getting power  why don't we just see if maybe we've got  a power supply or uh maybe it's a
lOBaA9zg3XM,3808160,3813760,cabling issue maybe these are not all  plugged in or something no that looks
lOBaA9zg3XM,3813760,3819760,fine okay  so there's two there's two different  plugs for it maybe we could just try
lOBaA9zg3XM,3819760,3825838,this one  let's just see if maybe that'll  that'll wake it up
lOBaA9zg3XM,3827680,3834000,oh are people suggesting side side kicks  yeah kid hindsight you know that would  be a good sidekick
lOBaA9zg3XM,3834000,3840720,that was a person who would bet on  everything borderlands had a dlc side  quest that was a person who'd bet on  everything and double down on everything
lOBaA9zg3XM,3840720,3846319,yeah okay that sounds pretty good hey  look at that  okay i don't know what happened there
lOBaA9zg3XM,3846319,3852480,but  when in doubt turn it off turn it back  on unplug it plug it back in collin's
lOBaA9zg3XM,3852480,3859599,grabbing the columns grabbing the boot  drive that sounds fantastic let's jump  into the bios make sure that we can  actually enable docp get our memory
lOBaA9zg3XM,3859599,3864960,profile running correctly because  otherwise we're going to be stuck at  ddr4 2133 which especially if we were
lOBaA9zg3XM,3864960,3871760,using onboard graphics would be a super  super super bad time  um
lOBaA9zg3XM,3871839,3876880,you really want to  you really want to maximize your memory  frequent what am i even doing there we
lOBaA9zg3XM,3876880,3882799,go really want to maximize your memory  frequency if you're using onboard  graphics which is one of those really  like like i don't know what to call it
lOBaA9zg3XM,3882799,3887920,catch 22 type things it's like you don't  have money so you need to go for onboard
lOBaA9zg3XM,3887920,3893920,graphics but the best way to get onboard  graphics is to spend or the best way to  enjoy your onboard graphics is to spend
lOBaA9zg3XM,3893920,3899280,more money it's like  so the answer is spend more money no  matter what you do
lOBaA9zg3XM,3899280,3904480,it's just frustrating right like i  understand the technology reasons why  there's nothing they can do about that
lOBaA9zg3XM,3904480,3911599,it's not a conspiracy  it's just frustrating  so our suggestion for the build thanks
lOBaA9zg3XM,3911599,3918000,colin is still oh is this my boot drive  this was on my test bench
lOBaA9zg3XM,3918000,3925440,oh boy well i have uh  i have no idea what this is i was  expecting it to be a saber drive
lOBaA9zg3XM,3925440,3931920,um  uh uh you know what let me try this one  first maybe it has windows on it so our
lOBaA9zg3XM,3931920,3937039,recommendation for the build is still  the 660p it's got a dram cache it's well
lOBaA9zg3XM,3937039,3942480,priced 90 bucks for a terabyte but  crucial p5 hey not a bad way to go  either and we've upgraded to two
lOBaA9zg3XM,3942480,3948400,terabytes which does put us over our our  thousand dollar  total budget that was a thousand dollars
lOBaA9zg3XM,3948400,3953599,including all of our peripherals which  we thought was kind of a nice place to  be given that you haven't been able to  get
lOBaA9zg3XM,3953599,3958799,any kind of you know you haven't been  able to get a gpu for under a thousand  dollars for the last freaking year
lOBaA9zg3XM,3958799,3965838,um  hold on i need to just come on come on  dude  okay there we go
lOBaA9zg3XM,3966240,3972799,all right let's try let's try this let's  see if we have windows on here we're  gonna we're gonna play a game that we  play all the time
lOBaA9zg3XM,3972799,3979839,called  is this my test badge drive  in the writing team we just yeah we we
lOBaA9zg3XM,3979839,3985599,tend to be a little bit lazy sometimes  if all you need to do is just you know  boot it up on stream and show it if  you're not doing any kind of serious
lOBaA9zg3XM,3985599,3990319,benchmarking a fresh install a fresh  install come on
lOBaA9zg3XM,3991280,3996880,1250 with the monitor and everything  sorry i'm sorry i was i was under that  so it's under a thousand including gpu  right that was the that was the
lOBaA9zg3XM,3996880,4003520,difference so it's like 700 something uh  without the gpu under a thousand with  the gpu and then about 1200 the monitor
lOBaA9zg3XM,4003520,4010079,keyboard mouse mechanical switches this  is from aukey and we've got our g502  hero
lOBaA9zg3XM,4010079,4015440,okay well it does have an os but it is  not windows
lOBaA9zg3XM,4017680,4025599,uh okay i mean alternately you can just  come entertain the people and i can go  try and find it that's uh another option
lOBaA9zg3XM,4025599,4031680,unless i put it in my backpack  and you have to do physical things
lOBaA9zg3XM,4031760,4037359,i used to keep it in  you talk about this oh no it's not in
lOBaA9zg3XM,4037359,4043200,here hold on hold on no no i got this  maybe i maybe i have one
lOBaA9zg3XM,4043440,4049119,i used to keep one in my backpack all  the time  you know what okay entertain the people
lOBaA9zg3XM,4049119,4054400,oh do the merch messages  there's a mic there just stand there
lOBaA9zg3XM,4061200,4067359,they're gonna be able to totally hear me  just like running  i was running
lOBaA9zg3XM,4068559,4075960,oh shoot  um there it is
lOBaA9zg3XM,4079280,4083240,oh i'm like
lOBaA9zg3XM,4094960,4102238,hi  uh yeah you know what drive this is this  is my gaming on linux drive i brought it  into work to get some screen cap for the
lOBaA9zg3XM,4102238,4108400,uh part four video or something like  that so  technically  you know what yeah why didn't that boot
lOBaA9zg3XM,4108400,4116400,hold on a second let's give it one more  chance let's give it one more chance  maybe we'll game on freaking linux here
lOBaA9zg3XM,4116400,4122000,well what  right  and worst case scenario i did find my
lOBaA9zg3XM,4122000,4127278,regular test bench boot drive so we got  that as well on my seven drive that's  why i was saying oh this isn't one i'd
lOBaA9zg3XM,4127278,4132798,want to recommend for this build it's  like a gen 4  drive it's a good good drive it just
lOBaA9zg3XM,4132798,4139600,costs more than gpu  uh  okay  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah i
lOBaA9zg3XM,4139600,4144960,don't know how well  um  i don't know how well it's gonna handle
lOBaA9zg3XM,4144960,4150719,just completely changing out the  hardware and trying to boot it windows  doesn't always handle this very well
lOBaA9zg3XM,4150719,4155758,and linux yeah better in a lot of ways  but i just literally do not know
lOBaA9zg3XM,4155758,4161920,how it handles stuff like this  i guess the answer is not today  that's fine that's fine we'll throw on
lOBaA9zg3XM,4161920,4168880,the other drive  do you want to actually throw me that  laptop if there's any other merch  messages that i should talk about
lOBaA9zg3XM,4169278,4175520,all right hit me but apparently  oh the mic wasn't on  oh that's hilarious oh man a couple
lOBaA9zg3XM,4175520,4181120,questions mostly just comments  all right cool uh so for stuff like hi  mom
lOBaA9zg3XM,4181120,4187520,oh this is all pushed to stream wait  these are all pushed to stream you  didn't curate any of them
lOBaA9zg3XM,4187520,4195920,oh okay well then there's nothing that i  really have to respond to then is there  well there's a couple questions  oh i see uh okay so uh yes uh for
lOBaA9zg3XM,4195920,4203120,questions that come in you wanna press  curate all right ideally yep yep that's  fine because that way i cause i'm live
lOBaA9zg3XM,4203120,4208719,and i can't uh  i can't brain noodle i can't read well  i'm trying to entertain the people okay
lOBaA9zg3XM,4208719,4215840,i'm on a 12 900k x690 ddr4 motherboard  uh and 370ti my question is should i get
lOBaA9zg3XM,4215840,4220960,faster memory 3600 megahertz c18 um no  no i probably wouldn't i probably
lOBaA9zg3XM,4220960,4226000,wouldn't spend more money on that system  i think what you need to do is you need  to buy more video games and play them
lOBaA9zg3XM,4226000,4233199,i mean honestly i've been stuck in that  trap so many times myself where  i end up just
lOBaA9zg3XM,4233199,4238400,playing with my computer instead of  playing on my computer does that kind of
lOBaA9zg3XM,4238400,4243440,make sense to you guys and i think that  sometimes we just we get really we get
lOBaA9zg3XM,4243440,4250080,really passionate about the machine you  know we want to cable manage it we want  to put lighting in it we want to we want  to optimize it now overclock it and it's
lOBaA9zg3XM,4250080,4257280,like hey remember why you got into this  in the first place  enjoy your games you know go go pick up
lOBaA9zg3XM,4257280,4262560,go pick up some some some indie some fun  indie games on steam just like try them
lOBaA9zg3XM,4262560,4268080,out support some indie devs uh just yeah  just play them uh do you mind looking  away while i type in this password oh no
lOBaA9zg3XM,4268080,4273280,wait maybe don't swing it around poor  okay i hope nobody gets motion sick
lOBaA9zg3XM,4273280,4279040,okay i'm in  a question  yeah
lOBaA9zg3XM,4279040,4284640,uh yeah  okay  go ahead  you could just you could just glance up

lOBaA9zg3XM,4304719,4312560,but you guys wouldn't have it any other  way and i know that for a fact that you  guys love us for us
lOBaA9zg3XM,4312560,4319520,oh plane chat i thought the computer was  the game pc building simulator yeah i  know guys wait how is it
lOBaA9zg3XM,4319520,4325199,huh do i already have like chipset  drivers and everything for for amd  installed on this system
lOBaA9zg3XM,4325199,4330640,hey that's freaking awesome  wow i have a really clean bench drive
lOBaA9zg3XM,4330640,4336000,go linus  okay so the only thing that i need then  is
lOBaA9zg3XM,4336000,4342719,uh i need the game drive  plus can i have the uh the game usb  you know the one i'm talking about right
lOBaA9zg3XM,4342719,4349520,yeah yeah in the writers area so we just  have a drive that just has a bunch of  games installed it's usbc this is a 10  gigabit usb 3 motherboard so it should
lOBaA9zg3XM,4349520,4355440,be fine  uh dylan says any chance to have an  update on the backpack super excited
lOBaA9zg3XM,4355440,4360880,about it also love the color scheme on  the pillow just picked up an expensive  edition pillow  yeah that's right
lOBaA9zg3XM,4360880,4367199,we mad lads actually freaking did it we  did an all alpaca wool
lOBaA9zg3XM,4367199,4372239,we did an all alpaca wool version of our  pillow i don't recommend it to be clear
lOBaA9zg3XM,4372239,4378320,this is absolutely a status item not a  practical item in any way shape or form
lOBaA9zg3XM,4378320,4383760,but it's selling spectacularly well  we've already moved through over a third  of them and we're not going to restock
lOBaA9zg3XM,4383760,4389440,it it's not the kind of thing that i  would expect people to continue to  to buy on an ongoing basis it's just one
lOBaA9zg3XM,4389440,4394880,of those things where hey if you want to  if you want to really flex for the  people who are in the know then you'll
lOBaA9zg3XM,4394880,4401360,have one and other than that we're not  going to we're not gonna try to push our  luck on it  all right let's plug that baby in as for
lOBaA9zg3XM,4401360,4408320,the backpack honestly i don't really  have any updates other than that we're  waiting for another sample that has some  tweaks to the pocket layout i'm still
lOBaA9zg3XM,4408320,4413760,extremely pleased with just the quality  and comfort of the bag so
lOBaA9zg3XM,4413760,4420080,it'll it'll come when it comes between  the backpack and the screwdriver i had a  funny conversation with kyle one of the
lOBaA9zg3XM,4420080,4425920,engineers in creator warehouse  with kyle and nick where we were talking  about hey what do we do about this issue
lOBaA9zg3XM,4425920,4431360,if you weren't telling the stream  earlier you'll want to rewind and check  out that story because it's  basically about how the screwdriver just
lOBaA9zg3XM,4431360,4437679,cost me another 140 000 us dollars um  so we were having a conversation that  went okay look
lOBaA9zg3XM,4437679,4443760,what if we  place an order with the alternate  factory like place another bulk order
lOBaA9zg3XM,4443760,4450239,with the alternate factory knowing that  the original factory is going to drag  their butts and then we'll just order
lOBaA9zg3XM,4450239,4456000,200 000 screwdrivers and i kind of  i had one of my like
lOBaA9zg3XM,4458880,4464480,lay on the floor moments because i was  like look  guys
lOBaA9zg3XM,4464480,4470000,i do not have  another three million dollars to order
lOBaA9zg3XM,4470000,4476560,another you know however many  screwdrivers like  that's what we've got deployed overall
lOBaA9zg3XM,4476560,4482480,on the for actually no that's not even  all of it because that doesn't include  um any of the amortized like any of the
lOBaA9zg3XM,4482480,4488239,costs that need to be amortized like the  molding and tooling  oh man so yeah anyway i was like look
lOBaA9zg3XM,4488239,4494080,literally  all the cash and credit everything that  i have is deployed right now
lOBaA9zg3XM,4494080,4499280,on screwdriver and backpack  that's it i actually have like nothing
lOBaA9zg3XM,4499280,4504320,don't worry paychecks are still fine  like we have operating cash
lOBaA9zg3XM,4504320,4509600,i just whenever i say stuff like that  it's like no no it's fine um we've never
lOBaA9zg3XM,4509600,4516080,been laid on a paycheck not once  but  people are getting paid yeah
lOBaA9zg3XM,4516080,4521199,chase i don't think you would have stuck  around this long just for intel extreme  tech upgrade
lOBaA9zg3XM,4521199,4528719,that was all we ever and that and that  dashing hoodie lanyard and uh and toot  combo over there
lOBaA9zg3XM,4529600,4536080,oh man  uh yeah cash flow tech tips  screwdriver's a solid and a heartbeat i
lOBaA9zg3XM,4536080,4541440,don't know guys right because it's  something we've never done before like i  think it's great you know you got the
lOBaA9zg3XM,4541440,4546640,got the nice ratchet you got the  knurling you got the black bits you got  the
lOBaA9zg3XM,4546640,4551840,sweet bit holder system you know  i think the ergonomics are freaking
lOBaA9zg3XM,4551840,4558880,awesome um oh oh oh okay i'm gonna i'm  re you ready i'm gonna leak something
lOBaA9zg3XM,4558960,4566159,and we're gonna do something really cool  we've actually been working with like a  uh like a small batch injection molding
lOBaA9zg3XM,4566159,4572480,place  to do  see this ring in here it's a little  delrin ring that sits between the
lOBaA9zg3XM,4572480,4578800,uh the ratchet selector and the handle  super super little tiny thing there so
lOBaA9zg3XM,4578800,4586400,it's made of delrin and it's black on  the standard one and it's to kind of  match the finish of the shaft  but we are working with a like a small
lOBaA9zg3XM,4586400,4591840,run injection molding place to do  colored rings and colored caps and we're
lOBaA9zg3XM,4591840,4596880,going to do a white internal for  many of your favorite influencers
lOBaA9zg3XM,4596880,4602159,so if your name is say steve from  gamer's nexus or justine
lOBaA9zg3XM,4602159,4609120,from ijustine  if your name is something along those  lines it is very likely that in the mail
lOBaA9zg3XM,4609120,4615440,around the time of launch you are going  to be getting a customized with your  colors version of the screwdriver so
lOBaA9zg3XM,4615440,4621360,unfortunately there's i  we don't actually have plans to  sell those
lOBaA9zg3XM,4621360,4628480,so it's more just like a cool thing to  do for like our our buds in the industry  but um yeah i'm really excited about it
lOBaA9zg3XM,4628480,4634159,and the reason it's top of mind is  because sarah showed me the packaging  design for it on tuesday and it's going
lOBaA9zg3XM,4634159,4640960,to  be a yes bit we'll be getting one um so  it's going to come with like a box like
lOBaA9zg3XM,4640960,4647040,a double size box and then it'll have  both versions so they'll get the the  standard one and then it'll have the
lOBaA9zg3XM,4647040,4652400,customized like them edition one it's  still gonna be ltt on the handle because
lOBaA9zg3XM,4652400,4658880,uh yeah it was gonna be a lot of a lot  of challenges to make sure that we got  everyone's like logos perfectly like
lOBaA9zg3XM,4658880,4665280,that do you mind just tilting up just a  touch while i type  thanks  thank you for good
lOBaA9zg3XM,4665280,4670320,david  david come back  but we're yeah we're really excited and
lOBaA9zg3XM,4670320,4676239,no no it's not just marketing for ltt  store eco  inu or whatever your name is because
lOBaA9zg3XM,4676239,4681280,there's no obligation we're just going  to send it to them they don't have to do  anything they can just use it or they
lOBaA9zg3XM,4681280,4687040,can give it away or they can throw it  away um it's just something we think  it's a really great screwdriver and we
lOBaA9zg3XM,4687040,4693040,want to send it to people  obviously if they talk about it yeah  that'd be that'd be swell but we don't
lOBaA9zg3XM,4693040,4699520,want anyone to feel like there's any  pressure or anything like that that  would be horrible  i i hate it when people do that to me
lOBaA9zg3XM,4699520,4706560,honestly like it's it's quite  frustrating  um  you know i think i think uh zach from uh
lOBaA9zg3XM,4706560,4712719,jerry rig everything handled it  absolutely perfectly he reached out to  me the other day he's got a knife  um so you guys are gonna want to check
lOBaA9zg3XM,4712719,4718080,that out i actually disclosed him i was  like look uh zach is a little awkward  like we're gonna do a knife at some
lOBaA9zg3XM,4718080,4724159,point but  it's not really on the immediate road  map so  if you do want to send it over i'd be
lOBaA9zg3XM,4724159,4730800,super happy to rep your knife but at  some point we're going to be bitter  rivals  and he goes uh you know what i think i
lOBaA9zg3XM,4730800,4736080,think i'll run that risk and so  he's sending over a couple so we'll have  it on short circuit we'll be able to use
lOBaA9zg3XM,4736080,4741760,the official jerry rig everything knife  uh you guys are gonna want to go check  out check that out but i just thought  the way that he handled it was super
lOBaA9zg3XM,4741760,4747679,classy he just reached out to me said  hey  you know are you are you interested so  he's actually doing it like better than
lOBaA9zg3XM,4747679,4753360,us i guess because i was just gonna send  it to people um and i'm still gonna do  that because we've already done all the
lOBaA9zg3XM,4753360,4758880,injection molding and it was expensive  but uh yeah
lOBaA9zg3XM,4758880,4765760,it can be frustrating when there's some  kind of well it feels like there's some  kind of obligation so i want to say  explicitly there there is none
lOBaA9zg3XM,4765760,4771199,now why is my game drive not showing up  that's a bit of a downer uh don't don't
lOBaA9zg3XM,4771199,4779360,worry don't worry david you don't have  to follow me over here like that i'm  just gonna see if maybe it's this usb  cable i keep a usb type a to type c
lOBaA9zg3XM,4779360,4785600,in my bag  just in case so we're going to try  plugging into the 10 gig type a port
lOBaA9zg3XM,4785600,4791679,just love that type a connector it's  like how have we not managed to build a  better connector than
lOBaA9zg3XM,4791679,4797360,usb type a it's just so robust and it  works  would you look at that
lOBaA9zg3XM,4797360,4804400,did this just pick up that steam library  like auto magically  that is super cool immediately we have a
lOBaA9zg3XM,4804400,4810000,bunch of games installed freaking love  it let's head straight to do maternal  because that's how i'm feeling right now
lOBaA9zg3XM,4810000,4813840,doom  all right
lOBaA9zg3XM,4815520,4823678,um  i'm such a huge screwdriver i'm gonna  buy one of your fans hey  got em thanks for that
lOBaA9zg3XM,4825440,4831600,have you seen the new steam interface  for moving games between drives i  haven't i did notice they redid the
lOBaA9zg3XM,4831600,4838000,they redid the game library drive  interface but i had not seen  just a new tool for that that's pretty
lOBaA9zg3XM,4838000,4844560,cool  what else is going on
lOBaA9zg3XM,4844639,4850400,head to head linus head to head what are  people talking about head-to-head
lOBaA9zg3XM,4850400,4856560,okay i don't know what they're talking  about might be a jerry rig everything i  feel like your jerry rig everything  knife will be higher quality i don't
lOBaA9zg3XM,4856560,4861920,know i don't know i haven't seen his yet  i'm actually super excited to check it  out
lOBaA9zg3XM,4861920,4868960,do you regularly update the games on  your test drives to make sure they'll be  able to boot um i think you see the  answer to that
lOBaA9zg3XM,4869120,4875679,the answer is a big fat no that's a  that's a negatory  oh the apu versus the gpu head-to-head
lOBaA9zg3XM,4875679,4881280,okay  yeah let's do it let's do it let's play  some do maternal get it kind of dialed
lOBaA9zg3XM,4881280,4889280,in  then we're going to rip out the 6500 xt  this poor  poor bottlenecked 6500 xt
lOBaA9zg3XM,4889280,4895679,and we're gonna run off of our onboard  gpu  actually let's fire up hardware info and
lOBaA9zg3XM,4895679,4903600,i can confirm for you guys that even  though the gpu is in the top slot here  let's just find it oh yeah navi 24 from
lOBaA9zg3XM,4903600,4910639,xfx  uh wait  does this chip support pcie gen 4
lOBaA9zg3XM,4910639,4916320,i guess it does  okay so never mind we're good i hadn't
lOBaA9zg3XM,4916320,4922480,looked that closely into the current gen  apus the last time we did a video about  one of amd's apus it was the last gen
lOBaA9zg3XM,4922480,4930159,ones that we had to source from overseas  because they didn't make them available  in north america for whatever reason so  this one is not nearly as bottlenecked
lOBaA9zg3XM,4930159,4936080,as i was expecting but everything else  that i said before  oh i know what's happening everything
lOBaA9zg3XM,4936080,4943120,else i said before remains true because  most people are not buying a brand new  current gen system to run a budget card
lOBaA9zg3XM,4943120,4948159,like this so most of the systems you  would put this thing in you would  experience that kind of
lOBaA9zg3XM,4948159,4952960,performance  crippling bottleneck
lOBaA9zg3XM,4954000,4960560,amd's website says 3.0  okay i'm getting some very  mixed messages here
lOBaA9zg3XM,4960560,4966159,because that's  what i thought too  but i guess we're wrong
lOBaA9zg3XM,4966159,4971199,okay i need to fix the resolution of  this display right now
lOBaA9zg3XM,4971199,4978000,oh no  uh i've only ever heard derek from vice  grip garage say automagically no no
lOBaA9zg3XM,4978000,4983280,automatically is like a thing i i'm  sorry  i'm sure derek's cool sounds like a
lOBaA9zg3XM,4983280,4991520,great show i unfortunately am not  familiar with it  so yeah that's not where i picked it up
lOBaA9zg3XM,4991520,4996960,oh wow  virtual super resolution blah blah blah  okay
lOBaA9zg3XM,4996960,5003520,okay hardware info seems a little  confused did doom eternal just crash  is that is that actually what just
lOBaA9zg3XM,5003520,5009120,happened  do maternal just crashed  uh
lOBaA9zg3XM,5009120,5015840,okay  uh  yeah
lOBaA9zg3XM,5019920,5026880,yeah okay  this is the new upgradeable laptop no  this is still the same framework laptop  that i had before
lOBaA9zg3XM,5026880,5032000,i really want a pink beanie it's my  favorite color unfortunately don't sell  that or much other pink things why is
lOBaA9zg3XM,5032000,5037120,that um the pink ones that we've done in  that super vibrant pink uh like the one
lOBaA9zg3XM,5037120,5042239,that chase is wearing over there  yeah  those have been limited like lambo
lOBaA9zg3XM,5042239,5048239,edition products for the most part that  are  it's not that we just like wanted to do  a pink product it's that they're themed
lOBaA9zg3XM,5048239,5055040,after my old car so they're pink with  green accents i think that we would like  to do more pink stuff in fact one of our
lOBaA9zg3XM,5055040,5060639,new blank t-shirt colors i think is some  kind of pink don't quote me on that it  might not be might not be i might have
lOBaA9zg3XM,5060639,5067840,that completely wrong do maternal  crashes for me all the time really i  have not had  i have not had that issue with it
lOBaA9zg3XM,5067840,5073440,oh boy i do have an issue with it  launching at 640 by 480  when you
lOBaA9zg3XM,5073440,5077760,first fire it up every time wait what
lOBaA9zg3XM,5078940,5085040,[Laughter]  are you serious right now
lOBaA9zg3XM,5085040,5091840,do maternal  has a check  right so it tries to anticipate how much
lOBaA9zg3XM,5091840,5097600,video memory you're going to need when  you  configure your graphics settings
lOBaA9zg3XM,5097600,5104960,it will not allow me to apply  a 1080p resolution setting because it
lOBaA9zg3XM,5104960,5110080,says i have insufficien insufficient  vram we haven't even talked much about  the fact that it only has four gigs of
lOBaA9zg3XM,5110080,5115280,vram in 2022  oh no
lOBaA9zg3XM,5115280,5122719,okay it's okay it's because it's at  nightmare quality so we'll go down to  medium  1080p now we're good
lOBaA9zg3XM,5122719,5128080,but  that is that's a freaking
lOBaA9zg3XM,5128080,5134480,issue i mean in most games i guess i  guess it won't really  matter because you'd never you'd never
lOBaA9zg3XM,5134480,5140320,be able to run them at a decent frame  rate anyway  like the the gpu is going to be a
lOBaA9zg3XM,5140320,5145520,bottleneck before the video memory but  jeez
lOBaA9zg3XM,5145760,5151280,it's definitely amusing  uh alex d92 says any updates on the big
lOBaA9zg3XM,5151280,5156960,water jugs we're definitely going to do  them  steve called it a waste of sand
lOBaA9zg3XM,5156960,5162159,steve hasn't considered it from my  perspective okay
lOBaA9zg3XM,5162159,5168360,if the suckers buy it more gpus for us  right steve
lOBaA9zg3XM,5171360,5177520,all right so let's go ahead and fire  this puppy up  here we go
lOBaA9zg3XM,5177520,5183840,all right  well for better or for worse
lOBaA9zg3XM,5185040,5190880,we are getting over 100 fps  1080p medium  yeah that's not
lOBaA9zg3XM,5190880,5194600,you know necessarily
lOBaA9zg3XM,5197280,5206199,the most difficult thing to do in do  maternal  but it's a lot better than having no gpu
lOBaA9zg3XM,5212000,5219360,and i mean what's the best gaming system  the one you have right like we've
lOBaA9zg3XM,5219360,5224560,i don't know we've seen some really  stupid comments on some of the videos  that we've done in the past where we've
lOBaA9zg3XM,5224560,5232960,taken for example  like an old uh like an old dell off of  ebay you know picked up a new gpu picked
lOBaA9zg3XM,5232960,5238480,up a new power supply and uh you know  tried to try to turn it into
lOBaA9zg3XM,5238480,5245120,you know something serviceable and we've  seen people kind of hate on that in the  past and i don't get it because my first
lOBaA9zg3XM,5245120,5252320,gaming machine right  was  a p1  166 is either p1166 or p190 i think it
lOBaA9zg3XM,5252320,5259199,was p1166  was that a fast computer at the time no  pentium 3 in fact i think pentium 4 had
lOBaA9zg3XM,5259199,5265120,already showed up by that time so no it  wasn't a gaming system from an elitist  standpoint
lOBaA9zg3XM,5265120,5270239,did i game on it absolutely  can we game on this
lOBaA9zg3XM,5270239,5276639,absolutely  did we have higher expectations  absolutely
lOBaA9zg3XM,5276639,5281840,but hey here we are  here we freaking are
lOBaA9zg3XM,5282800,5288400,one of the coolest things that's  happened over the last i'd say five  years is how accessible a decent gaming
lOBaA9zg3XM,5288400,5294560,monitor is  like it used to be that you had to i  mean  even if you had an unlimited budget you
lOBaA9zg3XM,5294560,5300960,couldn't get decent color and decent  gaming performance because crts had been  essentially moved completely out of
lOBaA9zg3XM,5300960,5307920,production worldwide and lcds were not  up to scratch yet and then there was a  period where you had to pick you had to
lOBaA9zg3XM,5307920,5314639,pick one you could have fast response  times or you could have decent color and  nowadays you can get something like this
lOBaA9zg3XM,5314639,5320560,and it's decent everything 144 hertz at  that point i think we showed in our
lOBaA9zg3XM,5320560,5326960,does fps actually matter video featuring  shroud that nvidia sponsored one we did  a while back we showed that
lOBaA9zg3XM,5326960,5334400,it makes a difference and past 144 the  you've you've reached a point of  diminishing returns so being able to get
lOBaA9zg3XM,5334400,5340960,that for just and have an ips type panel  pretty pretty pretty nice at this kind
lOBaA9zg3XM,5340960,5346560,of price point  of course  the question that remains is
lOBaA9zg3XM,5346560,5352320,was it worth spending what does it work  out to about a fifth of our budget was
lOBaA9zg3XM,5352320,5358480,it worth spending a fifth of our budget  on a 5600 xt and the only way to know  that for sure
lOBaA9zg3XM,5358480,5364600,is to remove it  let's give it a shot guys
lOBaA9zg3XM,5364719,5371199,did i say what i say  56 sorry sorry sorry 50 i i got it  confused for a gpu that um was a good
lOBaA9zg3XM,5371199,5379040,value when it came out  okay so 6500 xt here we go
lOBaA9zg3XM,5379040,5384080,[Music]  would you consider a va panel decent are  you talking ips i would absolutely
lOBaA9zg3XM,5384080,5390080,consider a va panel decent  you guys got to remember that what i'm  comparing it to is
lOBaA9zg3XM,5390080,5395920,i'm talking about like what's happened  over the last  years  right like there was a time period where
lOBaA9zg3XM,5395920,5400960,anything under 16 milliseconds of you  know true response time would have been
lOBaA9zg3XM,5400960,5408080,considered good actually not 16 sorry  excuse me i was thinking of 60 fps 16  milliseconds per frame times uh i would
lOBaA9zg3XM,5408080,5414239,you know anything under like 12  milliseconds would have been considered  you know good right like that's what
lOBaA9zg3XM,5414239,5419760,maybe not five years since maybe 10 15  years  um
lOBaA9zg3XM,5419760,5425280,all right are we are we gonna post with  the onboard gpu
lOBaA9zg3XM,5426080,5432239,1060 is similar performance from what  i've seen yeah the issue is just that  you can't get one and you can't get one  with a warranty on it
lOBaA9zg3XM,5432239,5437360,like for a lot of people and it's  something that has never been the end of  the world for me but for a lot of people
lOBaA9zg3XM,5437360,5446079,that peace of mind  is worth you know giving up some  performance  and that's fair enough like i get it
lOBaA9zg3XM,5446239,5450880,okay did that just completely work you  mind just tilting up for a second
lOBaA9zg3XM,5451440,5456560,here we go  let's see how our onboard gpu does
lOBaA9zg3XM,5456560,5463520,oh wait is it a different driver package  i actually did not know that
lOBaA9zg3XM,5463520,5467679,let's just see if it'll grab it  automatically
lOBaA9zg3XM,5468639,5474239,huh  to reinstall the drivers for this device  click reinstall driver hey thanks  windows
lOBaA9zg3XM,5474239,5479920,and where exactly would i do that  super useful oh
lOBaA9zg3XM,5480400,5486080,and it's done  cool  retry connection
lOBaA9zg3XM,5486080,5493360,love it  all right  let's see how our integrated gpu does
lOBaA9zg3XM,5493360,5499679,do maternal here we go ladies and  gentlemen  this is something that's interesting we  tried to communicate this man i guess it
lOBaA9zg3XM,5499679,5506800,would have been about three years ago we  tried to start uh redoing our  performance per dollar calculations
lOBaA9zg3XM,5506800,5514239,instead of just looking at it on an  individual component level which i  realized when i was working at ncix is
lOBaA9zg3XM,5514239,5522000,not actually the correct way to do it  you can't take a gpu that costs 500 and  will not cost 250 and go this one should
lOBaA9zg3XM,5522000,5528960,be double the performance of this one  intuitively that makes sense  but that's not actually correct because
lOBaA9zg3XM,5528960,5535440,you are in most cases  not just buying a gpu most people buy a  whole system
lOBaA9zg3XM,5535440,5540560,so  what i learned was that when you're  trying to spec out a balanced system you
lOBaA9zg3XM,5540560,5547600,need to consider the full cost  of the system compared to each  individual component's uplift in terms
lOBaA9zg3XM,5547600,5554320,of cost and we tried to create graphs  that reflected this uh when we did  things like gpu or cpu reviews where we
lOBaA9zg3XM,5554320,5560400,tried to spec out a  um  a reasonable accompanying
lOBaA9zg3XM,5560400,5566719,build  right  when we did the calculation for whether  it was a good value or not because if
lOBaA9zg3XM,5566719,5573120,you were going to spend let's say a  thousand dollars on a gaming system  is it worthwhile to spend twice as much
lOBaA9zg3XM,5573120,5578800,on your gpu for a 50  increase if that only increased your
lOBaA9zg3XM,5578800,5585920,overall budget by 20  right  whoa  right if you have a 200 gpu and you
lOBaA9zg3XM,5585920,5592080,spend 400  your total budget increase was only 20  so as long as it's more than 20 faster
lOBaA9zg3XM,5592080,5597120,at double the price it's actually a good  value  so it's just a different way of thinking
lOBaA9zg3XM,5597120,5603920,about it  um  from a full system perspective rather  than from a component perspective
lOBaA9zg3XM,5603920,5609600,now that doesn't mean that  i'm going to come out and say hey 6500  xt
lOBaA9zg3XM,5609600,5615760,great value go and buy it but it does  mean that i'm giving you guys an  alternate way of looking at it for
lOBaA9zg3XM,5615760,5622159,people who are buying a new system today  comparing onboard graphics versus the  6500 xt so you could look at onboard
lOBaA9zg3XM,5622159,5628239,graphics and you could say they cost  zero dollars therefore any dedicated  graphics card needs to be infinitely  faster
lOBaA9zg3XM,5628239,5634719,but  it's not really that simple by taking  our 750 dollar system here and spending
lOBaA9zg3XM,5634719,5640960,another 250  we're gonna go from give it a second
lOBaA9zg3XM,5641920,5647280,we're gonna go from  about 35 fps  all the way up to 100. it's a different
lOBaA9zg3XM,5647280,5653199,level  so  that was really the punchline of this  whole thing i spent a lot of time in
lOBaA9zg3XM,5653199,5658960,this stream sort of  ranting about the 6500 xt  but
lOBaA9zg3XM,5658960,5664639,there is another way of looking at it  and you guys have to understand that not  every customer is doing the same
lOBaA9zg3XM,5664639,5669920,calculation when they're speccing out a  machine  so does that does have you guys kind of
lOBaA9zg3XM,5669920,5675920,figured out where i was going with this  now can we confirm that the settings are  the same yeah the settings are identical  of course there
lOBaA9zg3XM,5675920,5681600,i didn't change anything  like that 1920x1080 medium
lOBaA9zg3XM,5681600,5687520,it's like yeah  amd makes great  onboard gpus
lOBaA9zg3XM,5687520,5696239,but even  a card that gets absolutely slammed by  the media and rightly so amd made some
lOBaA9zg3XM,5696239,5703920,design uh compromises here that i think  undermine the value of the product right
lOBaA9zg3XM,5703920,5711280,it's still a lot faster  than onboard graphics  like that
lOBaA9zg3XM,5712719,5718000,there you go that's the that's the whole  that's the whole thing guys that's the  that's the moral of the story that's the
lOBaA9zg3XM,5718000,5725119,big finish that's where we were heading  to this whole time  yes um  this is not the ideal situation but if
lOBaA9zg3XM,5725119,5731119,you got to make the most of it go check  out micro center at least it's in stock  it's better than nothing
lOBaA9zg3XM,5731119,5737080,and  that's all she wrote oh wait are there  any merch messages that i need to uh  address before we go
lOBaA9zg3XM,5737080,5744320,there's another little further  thank you bougie pillow for the win love
lOBaA9zg3XM,5744320,5750560,it uh steven says hey linus now that you  have some linux experience have you  thought about doing an arch linux  challenge try and get a system up and
lOBaA9zg3XM,5750560,5757199,running using nothing but the archwiki  and google maybe do it together um  honestly i haven't because for me my
lOBaA9zg3XM,5757199,5762800,next big linux adventure is gonna be  steam os 3.0 valve has taken such an
lOBaA9zg3XM,5762800,5768719,amazing i think just groundbreaking  approach to the work that they're doing  on the steam deck i mean they've been
lOBaA9zg3XM,5768719,5775360,working we can tell right because  remember steam machines valve has been  working on this initiative for
lOBaA9zg3XM,5775360,5782159,years  years  and they're making the whole thing  accessible to the entire open source
lOBaA9zg3XM,5782159,5787920,community i mean it's so freaking cool  the fact that they have said look you  can open up the hardware you can replace
lOBaA9zg3XM,5787920,5795199,the hardware you can freaking uh you can  install our steemos 3.0 on other  hardware how cool is that right so i
lOBaA9zg3XM,5795199,5803760,want to try steamos 3.0 on not a steam  deck i think that's going to be my next  sort of custom rig linux adventure
lOBaA9zg3XM,5803760,5809840,um hey thanks trolls trowels  i look forward to the whatever that's
lOBaA9zg3XM,5809840,5815360,not about doing  will linus model for the women's  underwear
lOBaA9zg3XM,5815360,5820960,don't think i'd be able to convince my  girlfriend otherwise  i
lOBaA9zg3XM,5820960,5827199,had not intended to  mm-hmm
lOBaA9zg3XM,5827199,5833280,i would love a mouse round up for people  with different size hands  so that's actually something i had in  mind for the lab it's not something that
lOBaA9zg3XM,5833280,5839679,we'd be able to do ourselves perfectly  but one of the ideas that i pitched in  one of our meetings about it was hey you
lOBaA9zg3XM,5839679,5845760,know would be really cool as part of our  sort of repository of data is if we um
lOBaA9zg3XM,5845760,5851199,sort of made a little tutorial for  people to measure their hands  uh then what we did was we had them take
lOBaA9zg3XM,5851199,5857520,a picture of their hand on the mouse  with some kind of verification  we could even just do it like your  craigslist style right so you just got
lOBaA9zg3XM,5857520,5862960,like your username on a piece of paper  and the date or something like that like  in the picture so we we get you to take
lOBaA9zg3XM,5862960,5868880,a picture of your hand on the mouse and  then we have you rate it in terms of  comfort and leave a couple of comments
lOBaA9zg3XM,5868880,5874239,and then what we could do is we could  have people go and measure their hand  using our methodology and say hey show
lOBaA9zg3XM,5874239,5880239,me mice that are that are generally  rated comfortable for people with my  hand size  because it's just not something that you
lOBaA9zg3XM,5880239,5885760,can create enough data on your own  unless you are the manufacturer and  you're literally commissioning studies  right
lOBaA9zg3XM,5885760,5892320,but for us there's a way that we could  come up with maybe to crowd sources so  that was one of the ideas that i had  that i thought would be super cool
lOBaA9zg3XM,5892320,5898400,um  i'm gonna clean up those pc cables yeah  i'm just not going to bother  sorry about the screwdriver yeah yeah i
lOBaA9zg3XM,5898400,5904480,hear you  um  paid three thousand dollars for a
lOBaA9zg3XM,5904480,5912400,macbook pro did i get scammed no i mean  as long as you knew that that was what  you were buying then you didn't get  scammed a scam means they deceived you
lOBaA9zg3XM,5912400,5919840,in some meaningful way you knew you were  buying a macbook pro if you're not  satisfied with it that's a whole other  it's a whole other conversation
lOBaA9zg3XM,5921360,5927360,all right  because i was told not to un synapse  hilarious bought a an expensive edition
lOBaA9zg3XM,5927360,5933199,pillow well that's it guys thank you  very much for tuning in i will see you  guys on the next video upload which i
lOBaA9zg3XM,5933199,5938480,guess will be uh oh i guess it'll be a  band show no i'll see you on my show
