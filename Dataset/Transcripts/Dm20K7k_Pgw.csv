Dm20K7k_Pgw,41840,44000,that restaurant was mcdonald's which
Dm20K7k_Pgw,44000,46160,ended up serving as an inspiration for
Dm20K7k_Pgw,46160,48079,the first winkies

Dm20K7k_Pgw,75360,77439,because it capitalized on the popularity
Dm20K7k_Pgw,77439,79119,of video games
Dm20K7k_Pgw,79119,81280,the animatronics that showbiz had
