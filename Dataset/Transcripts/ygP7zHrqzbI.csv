ygP7zHrqzbI,72240,73760,euro
ygP7zHrqzbI,73760,75520,to do three things
ygP7zHrqzbI,75520,77920,on one hand to diversify our energy
ygP7zHrqzbI,77920,79439,supply
ygP7zHrqzbI,79439,82159,second pillar is to increase the energy
ygP7zHrqzbI,82159,83600,efficiency
ygP7zHrqzbI,83600,86000,and the third pillar is the supply of
ygP7zHrqzbI,86000,87600,our own
ygP7zHrqzbI,87600,91520,own green renewable energy
ygP7zHrqzbI,91520,93119,other european leaders had different

ygP7zHrqzbI,101439,104079,survive europe however would end up in a
ygP7zHrqzbI,104079,106079,bad way other leaders are thinking of
ygP7zHrqzbI,106079,108079,ways to mitigate effects of the energy
ygP7zHrqzbI,108079,110799,crisis belgium prime minister

ygP7zHrqzbI,117920,119920,there is only one way to get through it
ygP7zHrqzbI,119920,123200,and that is all together we must form an
ygP7zHrqzbI,123200,125840,energy block if we do it separately we
ygP7zHrqzbI,125840,128479,will all go down separately so now the
ygP7zHrqzbI,128479,130160,european commission has to put into
ygP7zHrqzbI,130160,132080,practice what we have been working on
ygP7zHrqzbI,132080,133599,over the last months
ygP7zHrqzbI,133599,136160,make sure we buy energy as a group make
ygP7zHrqzbI,136160,138480,sure we use a price gap and make sure we

ygP7zHrqzbI,164560,167280,to apply more pressure now they claim
ygP7zHrqzbI,167280,168959,russia is waging an economic war on
ygP7zHrqzbI,168959,172640,europe by cutting gas supplies
ygP7zHrqzbI,180480,182239,not one of the eu leaders believes that
ygP7zHrqzbI,182239,184080,the technical reasons currently cited by
ygP7zHrqzbI,184080,185760,russian suppliers for the reduction of

ygP7zHrqzbI,199200,201200,rest of the world in the short term are
ygP7zHrqzbI,201200,203120,the exporters of gas who profit from
ygP7zHrqzbI,203120,205599,europe's desperation india and china
ygP7zHrqzbI,205599,207440,have already become alternate markets
ygP7zHrqzbI,207440,210000,for russia oil if the crisis forces a
ygP7zHrqzbI,210000,211920,speed up in the transition to renewable
ygP7zHrqzbI,211920,214080,energy then the wild may benefit in the
