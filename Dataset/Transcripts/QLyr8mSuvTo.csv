QLyr8mSuvTo,7040,11120,hey it's me me me me me me me me me me
QLyr8mSuvTo,11120,12880,me
QLyr8mSuvTo,12880,15360,today's video is another art things to
QLyr8mSuvTo,15360,17279,do when you're bored if you are new here
QLyr8mSuvTo,17279,18960,and you've never seen this series before
QLyr8mSuvTo,18960,20960,basically i do
QLyr8mSuvTo,20960,23519,art things to do when you're bored i
QLyr8mSuvTo,23519,25279,guess the title says it all doesn't it
QLyr8mSuvTo,25279,27199,basically each video i just gave a
QLyr8mSuvTo,27199,29199,couple different ideas for creative
QLyr8mSuvTo,29199,31279,activities that you can do i also
QLyr8mSuvTo,31279,33040,include kind of a mixture of art and
QLyr8mSuvTo,33040,35280,craft we may throw some crafts in there
QLyr8mSuvTo,35280,37520,a little crafty who knows i don't know
QLyr8mSuvTo,37520,39040,actually i do know because i already
QLyr8mSuvTo,39040,40239,planned this video and got all the
QLyr8mSuvTo,40239,41840,supplies for everything so
QLyr8mSuvTo,41840,45840,i do know cool so
QLyr8mSuvTo,47039,49360,let's get into the little ideas shall we
QLyr8mSuvTo,49360,53680,number one is make beads that's right
QLyr8mSuvTo,53680,56800,make beads did you hear me make beads
QLyr8mSuvTo,56800,59920,you can make beads out of paper who knew
QLyr8mSuvTo,59920,61760,i sure didn't maybe it's a thing that
QLyr8mSuvTo,61760,63680,everyone knows and now i'm just gonna
QLyr8mSuvTo,63680,66239,look stupid
QLyr8mSuvTo,66479,67920,of course this is gonna be extremely
QLyr8mSuvTo,67920,69439,time consuming because beads are these
QLyr8mSuvTo,69439,71280,little tiny little things it's gonna
QLyr8mSuvTo,71280,74640,take forever also this is slightly a
QLyr8mSuvTo,74640,77040,double activity
QLyr8mSuvTo,77040,79280,because not only can you make the beads
QLyr8mSuvTo,79280,80880,but then you can make something with the
QLyr8mSuvTo,80880,82640,beads which i will do but we'll get
QLyr8mSuvTo,82640,84240,there when we get there honey things
QLyr8mSuvTo,84240,85439,that you will need
QLyr8mSuvTo,85439,87680,paper i'm going to be using this sketch
QLyr8mSuvTo,87680,89119,paper
QLyr8mSuvTo,89119,90640,you can also use magazine paper or
QLyr8mSuvTo,90640,92320,scrapbook paper something with a pretty
QLyr8mSuvTo,92320,94240,pattern you got a brain use it also
QLyr8mSuvTo,94240,96400,pencil and ruler
QLyr8mSuvTo,96400,98840,some regular old glue
QLyr8mSuvTo,98840,102399,and some sort of glossy varnish very
QLyr8mSuvTo,102399,105920,minimal supplies here also bonus
QLyr8mSuvTo,105920,108000,what i'm going to be adding into the mix
QLyr8mSuvTo,108000,110079,my let me open it so you can see the
QLyr8mSuvTo,110079,112240,pretty colors oh that's actually kind of
QLyr8mSuvTo,112240,115439,messy and not pretty my watercolors set
QLyr8mSuvTo,115439,117520,so let's get started we get a piece of
QLyr8mSuvTo,117520,119040,paper paper
QLyr8mSuvTo,119040,121759,what uh so i'm just gonna paint
QLyr8mSuvTo,121759,123680,something real simple just some little
QLyr8mSuvTo,123680,126640,colors on my paper so that my beads have
QLyr8mSuvTo,126640,128479,some nice color to them oh look at that
QLyr8mSuvTo,128479,130000,it's rainbow how about that how'd that
QLyr8mSuvTo,130000,132400,happen okay now i just have to let this
QLyr8mSuvTo,132400,134480,dry completely
QLyr8mSuvTo,134480,136640,it's dry next i'm going to make some
QLyr8mSuvTo,136640,139440,horizontal lines about a centimeter in
QLyr8mSuvTo,139440,141599,length each then i'm going to turn those
QLyr8mSuvTo,141599,145120,into very elongated triangles about 24
QLyr8mSuvTo,145120,147120,centimeters tall those aren't super
QLyr8mSuvTo,147120,150800,precise uh but it'll work still uh oh i
QLyr8mSuvTo,150800,152800,forgot
QLyr8mSuvTo,152800,154239,you also need some scissors sorry to
QLyr8mSuvTo,154239,155840,spring that on you i know don't hold a
QLyr8mSuvTo,155840,157440,grudge now i'm just gonna cut the
QLyr8mSuvTo,157440,160080,triangles out they're not all um you
QLyr8mSuvTo,160080,162080,know perfectly uniform so they're all
QLyr8mSuvTo,162080,164319,gonna be a little bit different now i
QLyr8mSuvTo,164319,166000,forgot to list one of the most important
QLyr8mSuvTo,166000,169200,supplies i've truly failed you you also
QLyr8mSuvTo,169200,172080,need skewers you can use a toothpick as
QLyr8mSuvTo,172080,174000,well it's just a little bit easier to
QLyr8mSuvTo,174000,175440,use skewers because you know it just
QLyr8mSuvTo,175440,177519,gives you more room to hold and get out
QLyr8mSuvTo,177519,179360,a clean paint palette as clean as they
QLyr8mSuvTo,179360,182159,get time for the glue
QLyr8mSuvTo,182159,183840,glue does not have a very good flavor
QLyr8mSuvTo,183840,186319,pour a little glue on the palette i'm
QLyr8mSuvTo,186319,188239,gonna take a small paint brush i'm
QLyr8mSuvTo,188239,190239,realizing there's a lot more supplies
QLyr8mSuvTo,190239,192879,involved than i originally thought so
QLyr8mSuvTo,192879,195599,you are just going to wrap the paper
QLyr8mSuvTo,195599,199200,around the skewer and paint the inside
QLyr8mSuvTo,199200,201760,with glue as you go and just continue to
QLyr8mSuvTo,201760,204239,wrap around and glue and wrap around and
QLyr8mSuvTo,204239,207200,glue it's honestly kind of frustrating
QLyr8mSuvTo,207200,210159,it's like when a toilet paper roll comes
QLyr8mSuvTo,210159,212319,unrolled and then you have to re-roll it
QLyr8mSuvTo,212319,214640,and it doesn't line up and it's just
QLyr8mSuvTo,214640,216640,it's annoying that's what this is but
QLyr8mSuvTo,216640,218560,worse because it's very tiny doesn't
QLyr8mSuvTo,218560,220720,that sound fun you get the hang of it
QLyr8mSuvTo,220720,222799,after a while but it can be a little bit
QLyr8mSuvTo,222799,224959,frustrating at first once you get the
QLyr8mSuvTo,224959,227440,paper all the way rolled around then you
QLyr8mSuvTo,227440,229599,have the bead and i really love the
QLyr8mSuvTo,229599,231120,effect of the watercolor it makes the
QLyr8mSuvTo,231120,233200,bead gradually go through the rainbow
QLyr8mSuvTo,233200,234560,and i think it looks really pretty you
QLyr8mSuvTo,234560,236879,want to let that glue dry while you're
QLyr8mSuvTo,236879,238959,waiting you can just like start on the
QLyr8mSuvTo,238959,240720,rest of the beads and use the same
QLyr8mSuvTo,240720,243200,skewer and just keep on going look at
QLyr8mSuvTo,243200,245040,the difference between those two that is
QLyr8mSuvTo,245040,247519,not uniform all right got all my beads
QLyr8mSuvTo,247519,249760,rolled the beads are fully formed at
QLyr8mSuvTo,249760,251439,this point so for the final step we're
QLyr8mSuvTo,251439,253200,gonna switch the glue
QLyr8mSuvTo,253200,255360,for the mod podge i'm going to simply
QLyr8mSuvTo,255360,258239,apply a nice thick coat of mod podge all
QLyr8mSuvTo,258239,260799,the way around the entire bead but try
QLyr8mSuvTo,260799,262720,as much as possible not to get any of
QLyr8mSuvTo,262720,264960,the mod podge on the skewer itself you
QLyr8mSuvTo,264960,267360,will glue the bead to the skewer and
QLyr8mSuvTo,267360,270080,then it's not a bead it's just a skewer
QLyr8mSuvTo,270080,271919,with a little thing stuck to it i like
QLyr8mSuvTo,271919,274320,to do like two to five layers of mod
QLyr8mSuvTo,274320,276320,podge on there just to really like get a
QLyr8mSuvTo,276320,280160,smooth outside many a mod podge layer
QLyr8mSuvTo,280160,283520,later i have my beads all made beads
QLyr8mSuvTo,283520,284720,they smell like
QLyr8mSuvTo,284720,287840,nothing and now all we have to do is
QLyr8mSuvTo,287840,290800,remove the beads from the skewers and
QLyr8mSuvTo,290800,293759,what you're left with is some nice shiny
QLyr8mSuvTo,293759,296720,solid beads isn't that amazing they're
QLyr8mSuvTo,296720,299520,like my little miracles loose beads are
QLyr8mSuvTo,299520,301280,cool and everything but i think i
QLyr8mSuvTo,301280,303360,actually want to like put these to use
QLyr8mSuvTo,303360,305120,and make something with them i'm going
QLyr8mSuvTo,305120,307759,to grab some crystal string stretch and
QLyr8mSuvTo,307759,310160,strong for bracelet beading a key ring a

QLyr8mSuvTo,565440,569440,have paint mini
QLyr8mSuvTo,570080,571760,canvases
QLyr8mSuvTo,571760,574880,in the past i have not been intrigued at
QLyr8mSuvTo,574880,577839,all by the idea of painting on small
QLyr8mSuvTo,577839,580320,things i don't really like painting on a
QLyr8mSuvTo,580320,583200,tiny tiny scale but something got
QLyr8mSuvTo,583200,585120,rewired in my brain i think i was going
QLyr8mSuvTo,585120,587760,about painting on small things the wrong
QLyr8mSuvTo,587760,590880,way i bought this little box of tiny
QLyr8mSuvTo,590880,592480,canvases
QLyr8mSuvTo,592480,596720,it is small these are three by three
QLyr8mSuvTo,596720,599839,three by three inches instead of trying
QLyr8mSuvTo,599839,602160,to squeeze all of the detail and
QLyr8mSuvTo,602160,604720,information of a big painting into a
QLyr8mSuvTo,604720,607200,small painting just take a part of what
QLyr8mSuvTo,607200,609279,you would paint in a big painting and
QLyr8mSuvTo,609279,611360,put it on here i think i need to paint
QLyr8mSuvTo,611360,614160,bigger to have fun painting small am i
QLyr8mSuvTo,614160,616480,explaining this well at all i don't
QLyr8mSuvTo,616480,617920,think so basically i'm just going to
QLyr8mSuvTo,617920,620640,keep it simple so all you need is the
QLyr8mSuvTo,620640,623440,canvas some paints and a paint brush
QLyr8mSuvTo,623440,625360,which i don't have near me so you need a
QLyr8mSuvTo,625360,627680,paint brush whatever let's just get into
QLyr8mSuvTo,627680,631770,that and see what we can create
QLyr8mSuvTo,631770,638000,[Music]
QLyr8mSuvTo,638000,641090,[Applause]
QLyr8mSuvTo,652880,655880,so
QLyr8mSuvTo,656030,676340,[Music]
QLyr8mSuvTo,676340,676860,[Applause]
QLyr8mSuvTo,676860,680748,[Music]
QLyr8mSuvTo,681180,684430,[Applause]
QLyr8mSuvTo,684730,685960,[Music]
QLyr8mSuvTo,685960,687520,[Applause]
QLyr8mSuvTo,687520,701519,[Music]
QLyr8mSuvTo,701519,704959,alrighty and here they are
QLyr8mSuvTo,704959,707760,my mini painted canvases aren't they
QLyr8mSuvTo,707760,710480,cute i actually like these way more than
QLyr8mSuvTo,710480,712399,i thought i was going to if you can't
QLyr8mSuvTo,712399,715839,tell i painted three aliens hence the
QLyr8mSuvTo,715839,718320,space galaxy background on all of them
QLyr8mSuvTo,718320,720079,which i was trying to do like a
QLyr8mSuvTo,720079,722959,continuation kind of situation thing but
QLyr8mSuvTo,722959,725120,and nothing seems to really line up
QLyr8mSuvTo,725120,726959,perfectly so that got a little messed up
QLyr8mSuvTo,726959,729680,they don't look much like aliens this
QLyr8mSuvTo,729680,731680,one looks like a bug this one looks more
QLyr8mSuvTo,731680,734000,like just a cute monster kind of just
QLyr8mSuvTo,734000,736160,looks like a one-eyed bear maybe i need
QLyr8mSuvTo,736160,738800,to work on my alien design skills i
QLyr8mSuvTo,738800,740399,think i'm wearing the perfect shirt
QLyr8mSuvTo,740399,742639,today because these would just fit
QLyr8mSuvTo,742639,744959,perfectly into that group but these were
QLyr8mSuvTo,744959,746800,really fun and i actually really enjoyed
QLyr8mSuvTo,746800,749200,them and i really like them
QLyr8mSuvTo,749200,751839,i have more tiny artworks to add into my
QLyr8mSuvTo,751839,754320,box of tiny artworks
QLyr8mSuvTo,754320,757519,wonderful and we have the next idea
QLyr8mSuvTo,757519,760720,which is make diy
QLyr8mSuvTo,760720,764560,a magnets not uh magnets just magnets i
QLyr8mSuvTo,764560,766800,have done different techniques over the
QLyr8mSuvTo,766800,770240,years of making pins and magnets this is
QLyr8mSuvTo,770240,772160,uh the probably the quickest and most
QLyr8mSuvTo,772160,775600,simple way i just love making all the
QLyr8mSuvTo,775600,777920,little cute things clusters of little
QLyr8mSuvTo,777920,779760,objects you know what i mean i love that
QLyr8mSuvTo,779760,783040,what you will need some paper i am using
QLyr8mSuvTo,783040,786959,this bristol paper which is very thick
QLyr8mSuvTo,786959,788959,because i want to use poscas or they
QLyr8mSuvTo,788959,791920,need a very strong surface that they're
QLyr8mSuvTo,791920,793839,not going to chew up because they get a
QLyr8mSuvTo,793839,795440,little
QLyr8mSuvTo,795440,797279,speak of the devils
QLyr8mSuvTo,797279,798720,scissors
QLyr8mSuvTo,798720,803199,some clear drying glue
QLyr8mSuvTo,803279,804639,that was weird i found this on the
QLyr8mSuvTo,804639,807839,internet magnets and glass cabochons all
QLyr8mSuvTo,807839,810399,right let's get into this process get a
QLyr8mSuvTo,810399,812240,piece of paper and take my little glass
QLyr8mSuvTo,812240,815680,cabochon trace around that and then i
QLyr8mSuvTo,815680,818560,simply color in a design making sure to
QLyr8mSuvTo,818560,820560,carefully stay in the lines of that
QLyr8mSuvTo,820560,821839,circle it doesn't matter you're going to
QLyr8mSuvTo,821839,823519,be cutting it out because you are
QLyr8mSuvTo,823519,826480,drawing so small today is the day for
QLyr8mSuvTo,826480,829279,tiny art tiny art things to do when
QLyr8mSuvTo,829279,830720,you're bored now you're drawing very
QLyr8mSuvTo,830720,833600,small so keep it simple keep it fun
QLyr8mSuvTo,833600,835279,something like that
QLyr8mSuvTo,835279,838320,yeah it's outline polka dots okay but i
QLyr8mSuvTo,838320,841120,think when i do a whole set of them then
QLyr8mSuvTo,841120,843120,it'll look more exciting i've kind of
QLyr8mSuvTo,843120,845839,painted over the outline so i'm going to
QLyr8mSuvTo,845839,848399,put this back on here and i'm just going
QLyr8mSuvTo,848399,852720,to redraw my outline
QLyr8mSuvTo,852720,856079,we just cut this out take the glue i'm
QLyr8mSuvTo,856079,858079,just gonna get a little bit of that very
QLyr8mSuvTo,858079,860800,gooey spread it on the back of this
QLyr8mSuvTo,860800,864800,little cabochon a little painting thingy
QLyr8mSuvTo,864800,867519,on the back take one of these magnets
QLyr8mSuvTo,867519,869680,put some glue on that hopefully this
QLyr8mSuvTo,869680,872000,glue is strong because this is a honkin
QLyr8mSuvTo,872000,875040,magnet why is it so thick we don't need
QLyr8mSuvTo,875040,877440,like the incredible hulk of magnets i'm
QLyr8mSuvTo,877440,880320,just gonna continue on and create a nice
QLyr8mSuvTo,880320,884440,little custom magnet set
QLyr8mSuvTo,884440,921460,[Music]
QLyr8mSuvTo,921760,924800,okay finish my magnets they're all here
QLyr8mSuvTo,924800,926959,and accounted for they're all a little
QLyr8mSuvTo,926959,928639,bit different but have the same colors
QLyr8mSuvTo,928639,930800,and the same kind of thing going on so
QLyr8mSuvTo,930800,933279,they work really nicely as a set i did
QLyr8mSuvTo,933279,934720,buy this
QLyr8mSuvTo,934720,936480,just so i could display them look at
QLyr8mSuvTo,936480,939920,those boring magnets uh-uh so we take
QLyr8mSuvTo,939920,943519,our custom fun funky magnets
QLyr8mSuvTo,943519,944320,and
QLyr8mSuvTo,944320,946959,look at that
QLyr8mSuvTo,948399,952680,oh they're cute yes
QLyr8mSuvTo,954560,957040,does not erase very well at all i mean
QLyr8mSuvTo,957040,958800,these are obviously functional you can
QLyr8mSuvTo,958800,960560,use them to hold up little notes and
QLyr8mSuvTo,960560,961920,stuff which is cute and they can be
QLyr8mSuvTo,961920,963920,completely custom your own color scheme
QLyr8mSuvTo,963920,965759,your own design those are all the
QLyr8mSuvTo,965759,967120,activities that i'm gonna do in this
QLyr8mSuvTo,967120,969839,video it doesn't seem like a lot they're
QLyr8mSuvTo,969839,973040,also small hopefully at least one of
QLyr8mSuvTo,973040,975120,these activities was interesting enough
