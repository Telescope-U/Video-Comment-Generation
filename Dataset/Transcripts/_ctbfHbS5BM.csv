_ctbfHbS5BM,5000,7000,"I'm gonna wake up at 6:00 in the morning,"" type of person,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,7000,9500,"but you know, when you love something, you just end up doing it."
_ctbfHbS5BM,9500,12167,♪♪
_ctbfHbS5BM,12167,16417,"I'm kind of a Dominican cowboy, Queens pitmaster, brisket king."
_ctbfHbS5BM,16417,18792,"I mean, I really don't call myself anything,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,18792,21208,"Yeah, I'm a Dominican New York kid"
_ctbfHbS5BM,21208,23208,that those Texas style barbecue.
_ctbfHbS5BM,23208,26958,♪♪
_ctbfHbS5BM,26958,29292,We went from selling from our backyard
_ctbfHbS5BM,29292,30667,to one of the most popular
_ctbfHbS5BM,30667,32417,"and one of the biggest food festivals,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,32417,34375,"I would have to say, maybe in America."
_ctbfHbS5BM,34375,37500,♪♪
_ctbfHbS5BM,37500,40583,It's like the first Dominican in New York doing barbecue.
_ctbfHbS5BM,40583,41875,"I mean, come on now."
_ctbfHbS5BM,41875,50750,♪♪
_ctbfHbS5BM,50750,54583,"My name is Ruben Santana, owner and pitmaster of Bark Barbecue."
_ctbfHbS5BM,54583,56625,We specialize in central Texas style barbecue
_ctbfHbS5BM,56625,59417,with a little bit of Dominican influence.
_ctbfHbS5BM,59417,62375,[ Women singing in Spanish ]
_ctbfHbS5BM,62375,65125,[ Indistinct conversations ]
_ctbfHbS5BM,65125,68250,"The Dominican influence on my food,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,68250,70833,"I would have to say, has to do a lot with the spices."
_ctbfHbS5BM,70833,73083,"In Texas, it's really known to be salt, pepper,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,73083,77500,"but we use a little bit more than salt, pepper."
_ctbfHbS5BM,77500,79500,We cook on an offset smoker.
_ctbfHbS5BM,79500,81375,"It's really a long and slow process,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,81375,83125,the way we cook our meats.
_ctbfHbS5BM,83125,87375,"We offer a plethora of meats -- brisket, beef ribs,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,87375,90292,"turkey, chicken, pulled pork, pork ribs,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,90292,92542,"and our newest addition, chicharrón,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,92542,94750,"which would be pork belly, but, you know,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,94750,96208,"in the Dominican style,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,96208,99083,"and some of our sides are sweet platanos,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,99083,102125,"arroz congri, moro negro, coleslaw,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,102125,103542,and mac and cheese.
_ctbfHbS5BM,103542,105375,The reason why we're called Bark Barbecue
_ctbfHbS5BM,105375,109083,is because of what happens with the smoke and the meat.
_ctbfHbS5BM,109083,111250,The outer layering of the meat forms a bark.
_ctbfHbS5BM,111250,113708,"So any time you see, like, the brisket and it's all black,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,113708,116375,it's not that it's burnt or charred.
_ctbfHbS5BM,116375,118500,It's -- that's called the bark.
_ctbfHbS5BM,118500,121333,"The turkey is a really popular item,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,121333,123583,but I feel like it's slept on too much.
_ctbfHbS5BM,123583,126125,Too many people sleep on the turkey. I got to change that.
_ctbfHbS5BM,126125,128250,People are just traumatized from Thanksgiving
_ctbfHbS5BM,128250,130457,and deli turkey and stuff like that.
_ctbfHbS5BM,130457,133083,"But in reality, when you're smoking these meats,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,133083,136208,"it brings out all the flavors, really makes it juicy."
_ctbfHbS5BM,136208,139667,I feel like more people need to be turkey people.
_ctbfHbS5BM,139667,143125,These are our boneless turkey breasts.
_ctbfHbS5BM,143125,146583,"Central Texas style barbecue is really salt-pepper based,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,146583,150208,but I think I'd get crucified if I gave anybody here in New York
_ctbfHbS5BM,150208,151708,"just salt, pepper on their meat."
_ctbfHbS5BM,151708,153167,"Not that it'll be bland or anything,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,153167,155375,"but New York is like a hotbed for so many,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,155375,158083,"like, different flavors and cultural food"
_ctbfHbS5BM,158083,161083,"and stuff like that, so it -- it'll be a disservice"
_ctbfHbS5BM,161083,166417,if I didn't really add my little touch of Dominican-ness to it.
_ctbfHbS5BM,166417,169292,"Yeah, I'm gonna use a little bit of oregano --"
_ctbfHbS5BM,169292,172125,"imported oregano from DR, the best oregano,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,172125,174500,"some cumin, a little bit of chili powder."
_ctbfHbS5BM,174500,176875,"The majority of the flavor is gonna come from the smoke,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,176875,179167,"but nonetheless, I like to create layers of flavor."
_ctbfHbS5BM,179167,181833,"We bring up the temperatures to a point where it forms,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,181833,183125,"like, an outer crust on the turkey,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,183125,186000,"and you have, like, these nice spices"
_ctbfHbS5BM,186000,189792,when you bite into it on the outside.
_ctbfHbS5BM,189792,191083,It's all about the bark.
_ctbfHbS5BM,191083,193167,"These are gonna smoke for about three,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,193167,194583,three and a half hours.
_ctbfHbS5BM,194583,196208,"When the turkeys are ready, I pull them out,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,196208,198500,and I wrap them in some unsalted butter.
_ctbfHbS5BM,198500,200333,"A lot of people, when they have the turkey"
_ctbfHbS5BM,200333,202208,or when I force them to have the turkey...
_ctbfHbS5BM,202208,204333,[ Chuckles ] I'm lying. I give them samples.
_ctbfHbS5BM,204333,205833,"...they're like, ""Wow,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,205833,207250,I wasn't expecting this to taste like this.
_ctbfHbS5BM,207250,208708,"Everything is self-taught, to be honest,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,208708,211542,"but I watched a lot of videos on YouTube,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,211542,213792,"and after a point, I reached out"
_ctbfHbS5BM,213792,216250,"to a lot of, like, pitmasters out there in Texas,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,216250,217875,and they gave me a lot of tips.
_ctbfHbS5BM,217875,219542,There was a point where I had to stop watching YouTube
_ctbfHbS5BM,219542,222833,because I had to figure out my own way of doing it.
_ctbfHbS5BM,222833,227042,This process is about three to four days in the making.
_ctbfHbS5BM,227042,229667,"We usually sell out, like, in three hours."
_ctbfHbS5BM,229667,231458,So we're talking about three days of work
_ctbfHbS5BM,231458,235000,for three hours of service.
_ctbfHbS5BM,235000,237917,I start my -- my cooking week on Thursdays.
_ctbfHbS5BM,237917,241292,"Those cooks usually go on till, like, 2:00 in the morning,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,241292,243208,"'cause I'm usually sleeping, like, around 4:30"
_ctbfHbS5BM,243208,245667,to wake up about 8:00 to start it over again.
_ctbfHbS5BM,245667,248875,So and that's on a perfect day.
_ctbfHbS5BM,248875,253208,"No rain, no snow. No wind."
_ctbfHbS5BM,253208,255792,You need a hell of a lot of patience.
_ctbfHbS5BM,255792,257250,And you got to dedicate time to it
_ctbfHbS5BM,257250,259042,"because if you don't dedicate that time to it,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,259042,261042,you're just gonna be making mediocre barbecue.
_ctbfHbS5BM,261042,264125,Let's see. So we're already losing daylight right now.
_ctbfHbS5BM,264125,265208,These are usually how the days go.
_ctbfHbS5BM,265208,267458,I'm here when the sun's out
_ctbfHbS5BM,267458,272625,till when it goes down and it's pitch black out here.
_ctbfHbS5BM,272625,274750,"Right now, we're about to load up all the cambrels"
_ctbfHbS5BM,274750,278125,and the warmers to head out to the market.
_ctbfHbS5BM,278125,280375,"Every weekend, we're currently at Smorgasberg."
_ctbfHbS5BM,280375,283458,We service at Smorgasberg on Saturdays at Williamsburg
_ctbfHbS5BM,283458,285083,"and Sundays, Prospect Park."
_ctbfHbS5BM,285083,287292,"It's actually the last Sunday of the market today,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,287292,290750,so we're expecting to be pretty busy today.
_ctbfHbS5BM,290750,293875,So we got extra proteins for us today.
_ctbfHbS5BM,293875,296000,"I usually cook all the meats by myself,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,296000,298333,but my girl helps me with all our sides.
_ctbfHbS5BM,298333,300625,I have my cousins that sometimes help us out at the market.
_ctbfHbS5BM,300625,301917,"What's going on, baby?"
_ctbfHbS5BM,301917,303582,"-Hey, good morning. -Good morning."
_ctbfHbS5BM,303583,307417,So it's like a collective effort from everybody.
_ctbfHbS5BM,307417,310832,"So today for the sides, we got our platanos maduros --"
_ctbfHbS5BM,310833,312500,"really, really a customer favorite."
_ctbfHbS5BM,312500,314833,The maduros recipe is really about having a keen eye
_ctbfHbS5BM,314833,317625,"to know which maduros you're grabbing, to be honest with you."
_ctbfHbS5BM,317625,319208,You got to know when they're ripe enough.
_ctbfHbS5BM,319208,321542,"So if you don't know how to pick maduros or platanos,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,321542,323542,"you ain't Dominican, so..."
_ctbfHbS5BM,323542,326707,"And then we have our Dominican torta,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,326708,328417,which would be AKA cornbread.
_ctbfHbS5BM,328417,331292,"My kids love this recipe, their mom loves this recipe,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,331292,333250,and it was her mom that passed it down to her.
_ctbfHbS5BM,333250,336875,And then we have our spicy coleslaw.
_ctbfHbS5BM,336875,339500,"We use celery salt, some sriracha,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,339500,343458,some black pepper and vinegar and mayonnaise.
_ctbfHbS5BM,343458,347250,My very first job was at Zaro's Bakery.
_ctbfHbS5BM,347250,349625,That was a bakery out there in Penn Station.
_ctbfHbS5BM,349625,351625,"I think that was my only food job,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,351625,354875,and it was actually my last one before barbecue.
_ctbfHbS5BM,354875,359625,"I work for a HVAC company, and I also work in automotive."
_ctbfHbS5BM,359625,361375,"So I've always had, like, this history"
_ctbfHbS5BM,361375,362833,of working with my hands.
_ctbfHbS5BM,362833,364917,"And when it came to barbecue, it's hard labor,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,364917,367625,"but I guess I was just, you know, used to it."
_ctbfHbS5BM,367625,370417,"I did the HVAC for about four or five years,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,370417,371792,and that's when I started dabbling
_ctbfHbS5BM,371792,374332,into the smoked-meats side of things.
_ctbfHbS5BM,374333,376083,It's crazy because it was just something
_ctbfHbS5BM,376083,378750,that I was doing it after work on Fridays.
_ctbfHbS5BM,378750,381458,I would prep all the meat and go throughout the whole night
_ctbfHbS5BM,381458,383250,and service all Saturday
_ctbfHbS5BM,383250,385042,and didn't get any sleep until Sunday.
_ctbfHbS5BM,385042,387000,I did that for months out of the backyard.
_ctbfHbS5BM,387000,389167,"People would come, buy my food, we would sell out,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,389167,391417,"until eventually we had a line going up the driveway,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,391417,393667,"and that's when it hit me, like, ""Wow, this is something"
_ctbfHbS5BM,393667,395667,"that it seems like can be something,"""
_ctbfHbS5BM,395667,397707,"because it was basically a hobby, to be honest with you."
_ctbfHbS5BM,397708,400583,But I took it more than that because it takes more to --
_ctbfHbS5BM,400583,402375,"to be like, ""I'm a stay up all night,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,402375,405000,cook this brisket with no sleep after work
_ctbfHbS5BM,405000,407042,and do service the next day
_ctbfHbS5BM,407042,409042,"and only have like one day out of the week for yourself."""
_ctbfHbS5BM,409042,412875,So I felt like I really wanted to be good at cooking barbecue.
_ctbfHbS5BM,412875,415667,"When I first started, I had a cheap hundred-dollar smoker."
_ctbfHbS5BM,415667,417375,I was doing one brisket a week.
_ctbfHbS5BM,417375,419333,"I would call people and tell them, ""I'm doing barbecue."
_ctbfHbS5BM,419333,421500,"Hey, would you like some barbecue?"""
_ctbfHbS5BM,421500,423208,"And, you know, people would actually buy. It was just one brisket."
_ctbfHbS5BM,423208,426417,"This would be people I would harass over the phone,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,426417,429667,but I would cook that brisket as if I was gonna serve
_ctbfHbS5BM,429667,431000,"100 people, you know?"
_ctbfHbS5BM,431000,432250,And the same way goes now.
_ctbfHbS5BM,432250,433542,"Like, if I'm serving 100,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,433542,435250,I still have that attention to detail
_ctbfHbS5BM,435250,436708,as if it's just one brisket.
_ctbfHbS5BM,436708,439125,"After, you know, I got this smoker,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,439125,444708,"it jumped to 10, 12 biscuits, then 20, 30."
_ctbfHbS5BM,444708,446792,"And now look, and it's, you know, it's"
_ctbfHbS5BM,446792,448542,"these little, small progressions"
_ctbfHbS5BM,448542,451292,"that actually amount to, like, something bigger."
_ctbfHbS5BM,451292,453750,So I think we want to pull these rib tips
_ctbfHbS5BM,453750,456333,and wrap these so we can finish them off.
_ctbfHbS5BM,456333,459875,So our rib tips are basically an extension of our ribs.
_ctbfHbS5BM,459875,463000,Let's say you have a rack of spare ribs right here.
_ctbfHbS5BM,463000,465208,"This is basically the top of that spare rib,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,465208,469000,so I counter the saltiness with some sweetness not too crazy.
_ctbfHbS5BM,469000,471833,The pure honey helps with the meat not drying out
_ctbfHbS5BM,471833,473500,"when it's wrapped and holding and of course,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,473500,476042,also gives a little bit of flavor.
_ctbfHbS5BM,476042,478582,This gets wrapped. It's gonna go back in the smoker.
_ctbfHbS5BM,478583,481250,"Basically, what I'm gonna look for is that I can lift this up,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,481250,483250,"and it's just like falling over my hand,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,483250,485167,"and we're gonna pull it off, let it cool down,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,485167,486832,and then we're gonna throw it in the warmer.
_ctbfHbS5BM,486833,488542,to hold for tomorrow's service.
_ctbfHbS5BM,488542,490457,The type of barbecue that we do
_ctbfHbS5BM,490458,493208,really isn't that common in New York.
_ctbfHbS5BM,493208,497542,I wanted to bring a Dominican influence into the barbecue
_ctbfHbS5BM,497542,499375,because it's basically my background.
_ctbfHbS5BM,499375,502667,"It would be like me fighting myself not to season something,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,502667,505375,"you know, the way I was used to growing up."
_ctbfHbS5BM,505375,507917,♪♪
_ctbfHbS5BM,507917,513208,"I was actually born in uptown in DR 2.0, Washington Heights,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,513208,515083,but I was raised the majority in Queens --
_ctbfHbS5BM,515083,516583,"in Southside Jamaica, Queens."
_ctbfHbS5BM,516583,519833,I was raised in a house full of women only.
_ctbfHbS5BM,519833,522000,My grandmother had custody of us.
_ctbfHbS5BM,522000,525208,"I had aunts, cousins, and they all used"
_ctbfHbS5BM,525208,526792,to just throw down in the kitchen --
_ctbfHbS5BM,526792,528625,all the holidays and all that stuff.
_ctbfHbS5BM,528625,532917,My childhood -- it was just like any other childhood of minority
_ctbfHbS5BM,532917,534542,raised in the inner city.
_ctbfHbS5BM,534542,535875,"Wasn't that great at school,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,535875,537542,gave my grandmother a lot of trouble.
_ctbfHbS5BM,537542,540417,"When I was 19, I was arrested for a firearm --"
_ctbfHbS5BM,540417,542958,"well, set up for a firearm,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,542958,546083,and I was incarcerated in Rikers Island.
_ctbfHbS5BM,546083,547708,That was a tough time.
_ctbfHbS5BM,547708,549958,Being in the jail system is something -- something
_ctbfHbS5BM,549958,552833,"really common in -- in our family, so it seems like"
_ctbfHbS5BM,552833,555583,"I was just continuing the chain, basically."
_ctbfHbS5BM,555583,558458,In there is when I made the choice to improve myself
_ctbfHbS5BM,558458,561292,"and wanted to break that chain in my family,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,561292,562875,and I came out there a better person.
_ctbfHbS5BM,562875,565875,"I learned about who I am, that I'm not a follower,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,565875,567458,"that I want to be a leader,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,567458,570000,and I do have the traits to be a leader.
_ctbfHbS5BM,570000,572333,-The rib tips.
_ctbfHbS5BM,572333,573958,"-I actually saw a guy walking, said, ""Oh, my God,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,573958,575750,"that meat looks good,"" and so I was like -- she's like,"
_ctbfHbS5BM,575750,577625,"""It's probably this guy,"" so then we came over here."
_ctbfHbS5BM,577625,581583,So we got a mixture of the lean and the moist brisket.
_ctbfHbS5BM,581583,584000,-I ordered a pound of brisket.
_ctbfHbS5BM,584000,586875,It's delicious. It's super juicy.
_ctbfHbS5BM,586875,588708,-I try to come almost every weekend.
_ctbfHbS5BM,588708,590750,"I live in Manhattan, actually, so I've been commuting"
_ctbfHbS5BM,590750,593875,to either Williamsburg or to Prospect Park just for these guys.
_ctbfHbS5BM,593875,598250,"Reuben's great. Lots of great people, great food, great hospitality."
