D0T7KwvmFQA,56160,60000,say are you happy because i'm so driven
D0T7KwvmFQA,60000,62000,that it almost makes people who are
D0T7KwvmFQA,62000,65040,weaker in the mind think my god
D0T7KwvmFQA,65040,67200,you must not be happy
D0T7KwvmFQA,67200,69840,that's a weaker person's way of saying

D0T7KwvmFQA,81360,83200,when i was a weak person
D0T7KwvmFQA,83200,85040,these are some of the things i would ask
D0T7KwvmFQA,85040,87439,a very driven person because i didn't
D0T7KwvmFQA,87439,90159,understand what they were doing
D0T7KwvmFQA,90159,93040,because they were so driven that my mind
D0T7KwvmFQA,93040,95600,was so weak that i was like they must
D0T7KwvmFQA,95600,98560,not be happy i would find a way to put a
D0T7KwvmFQA,98560,101520,title like they're crazy or they're not
D0T7KwvmFQA,101520,104240,fulfilled or they're empty
D0T7KwvmFQA,104240,105600,because
D0T7KwvmFQA,105600,108640,i didn't have what they had so basically
D0T7KwvmFQA,108640,110640,if i get these questions

D0T7KwvmFQA,122000,124000,i'm a big faith believer but god didn't
D0T7KwvmFQA,124000,126000,tell me to rest
D0T7KwvmFQA,126000,127360,when i got through with that first
D0T7KwvmFQA,127360,129599,hundred mile race that i did around that
D0T7KwvmFQA,129599,131280,one mile track that i didn't prepare for
D0T7KwvmFQA,131280,133280,and i was considerably
D0T7KwvmFQA,133280,134720,it was horrible
D0T7KwvmFQA,134720,136480,and i'll never forget
D0T7KwvmFQA,136480,138160,i found
D0T7KwvmFQA,138160,140800,such peace and beauty and i got i was in
D0T7KwvmFQA,140800,142879,the worst pain in my life
D0T7KwvmFQA,142879,144640,and i got done and my wife pulled the
D0T7KwvmFQA,144640,146640,car up on the my ex-wife
D0T7KwvmFQA,146640,148160,pulled the car up on this
D0T7KwvmFQA,148160,150560,little lawn and i got in the back of it
D0T7KwvmFQA,150560,152319,and i got up the stairs i'm not gonna go
D0T7KwvmFQA,152319,153680,through the whole story but i remember
D0T7KwvmFQA,153680,155680,laying in the in the tub
D0T7KwvmFQA,155680,157920,and she put the shower on me
D0T7KwvmFQA,157920,160879,and i ran 101 miles like 19 hours and i
D0T7KwvmFQA,160879,163920,was like peeing dirt out of me
D0T7KwvmFQA,163920,165360,and i'm sitting there and i'm
D0T7KwvmFQA,165360,167760,jackhammering and my body is just the
D0T7KwvmFQA,167760,169760,most broken it's ever been even to this
D0T7KwvmFQA,169760,171200,day
D0T7KwvmFQA,171200,173680,and this feeling came over me
D0T7KwvmFQA,173680,175519,call it crazy if you want but very few
D0T7KwvmFQA,175519,177599,people i guarantee ever felt this before
D0T7KwvmFQA,177599,179760,to push themselves so far outside of
D0T7KwvmFQA,179760,181120,what they thought was even possible even
D0T7KwvmFQA,181120,182159,for me
D0T7KwvmFQA,182159,185120,i laid in that tub and i didn't want it
D0T7KwvmFQA,185120,186080,to go away
D0T7KwvmFQA,186080,187280,[Music]
D0T7KwvmFQA,187280,192319,i had drained myself of every bit of
D0T7KwvmFQA,192319,194879,strength energy i had
D0T7KwvmFQA,194879,196800,and it was the best feeling i had in my
D0T7KwvmFQA,196800,198560,life all that pain it was it was
D0T7KwvmFQA,198560,200159,confirmation
D0T7KwvmFQA,200159,202959,that i had gone through a crucible
D0T7KwvmFQA,202959,205599,and i had figured out another level of
D0T7KwvmFQA,205599,207920,david goggins a level that i thought was
D0T7KwvmFQA,207920,210400,humanly impossible for anybody to do
D0T7KwvmFQA,210400,212159,when i was at mile 70 and pissed all
D0T7KwvmFQA,212159,214640,over myself and had 30 more miles to go
D0T7KwvmFQA,214640,217120,and i was damn near dead
D0T7KwvmFQA,217120,220319,and i was able to go 31 more miles
D0T7KwvmFQA,220319,222400,in that process of the next 31 more
D0T7KwvmFQA,222400,223519,miles
D0T7KwvmFQA,223519,226000,i found out more about myself in that 31
D0T7KwvmFQA,226000,229519,miles than ever have in my entire life
D0T7KwvmFQA,229519,231280,the conversations
D0T7KwvmFQA,231280,233760,the mental blocks the road blocks
D0T7KwvmFQA,233760,236720,everything horrible it was just feeding
D0T7KwvmFQA,236720,238959,at me like light speed get out of here
D0T7KwvmFQA,238959,241360,man like if i was able to figure out
D0T7KwvmFQA,241360,243200,different tactics
D0T7KwvmFQA,243200,244720,and when i finally got done with that i
D0T7KwvmFQA,244720,247120,laid in that tub and it was over
D0T7KwvmFQA,247120,249280,the feeling of my god man you just
D0T7KwvmFQA,249280,250239,really

D0T7KwvmFQA,255040,258000,that guarantee very few people have
D0T7KwvmFQA,258000,260239,so it's a it's a feeling i can't even
D0T7KwvmFQA,260239,262000,describe
D0T7KwvmFQA,262000,263440,there's always a
D0T7KwvmFQA,263440,265919,blockade there's a barrier
D0T7KwvmFQA,265919,267440,in your brain
D0T7KwvmFQA,267440,269040,you got to find out
D0T7KwvmFQA,269040,271680,what kind of removes that barrier from
D0T7KwvmFQA,271680,272800,your brain
D0T7KwvmFQA,272800,275280,my biggest barrier was my father
D0T7KwvmFQA,275280,277440,and once i removed that barrier
D0T7KwvmFQA,277440,279120,i was free
D0T7KwvmFQA,279120,280560,to think
D0T7KwvmFQA,280560,283680,and once i felt good about myself
D0T7KwvmFQA,283680,286080,i was free to put action in
D0T7KwvmFQA,286080,288479,i never felt good about myself
D0T7KwvmFQA,288479,290320,i never felt good by myself whenever i
D0T7KwvmFQA,290320,292000,would get somewhere
D0T7KwvmFQA,292000,293919,the demon would come back put me right
D0T7KwvmFQA,293919,295520,back in the cage

D0T7KwvmFQA,354080,354880,thing
D0T7KwvmFQA,354880,357360,and if you look at life as it is a
D0T7KwvmFQA,357360,360160,trial ground a testing ground
D0T7KwvmFQA,360160,362240,for where you need to belong where you

D0T7KwvmFQA,380000,381120,me now
D0T7KwvmFQA,381120,383120,i get it whenever
D0T7KwvmFQA,383120,384960,i'm being like depressed i go to
D0T7KwvmFQA,384960,387120,depressed moments like oh hang on i'm
D0T7KwvmFQA,387120,389440,getting tested so you have to be aware
D0T7KwvmFQA,389440,391680,of all the signals and signs that are
D0T7KwvmFQA,391680,394560,being given to you from the world one of
D0T7KwvmFQA,394560,395600,them
D0T7KwvmFQA,395600,398000,is if you feel bad
D0T7KwvmFQA,398000,399759,you're being tested how are you going to
D0T7KwvmFQA,399759,401440,perform under that
D0T7KwvmFQA,401440,404560,and that's suffering is a part of life
D0T7KwvmFQA,404560,406160,i invented this thing called the cookie
D0T7KwvmFQA,406160,408240,jar when i was growing up you know how
D0T7KwvmFQA,408240,409360,your mom
D0T7KwvmFQA,409360,411680,we were real poor and she would go by
D0T7KwvmFQA,411680,413360,and get these cheap ass cookies from all
D0T7KwvmFQA,413360,414880,these which is like a generic grocery
D0T7KwvmFQA,414880,416080,store
D0T7KwvmFQA,416080,418479,and like 50 cent cookies and she just
D0T7KwvmFQA,418479,420160,dumped them in this cookie jar
D0T7KwvmFQA,420160,421599,so sometimes you're reaching the cookie
D0T7KwvmFQA,421599,424319,jar and you pull out a of mint cookie
D0T7KwvmFQA,424319,426000,maybe a chocolate chip
D0T7KwvmFQA,426000,428080,maybe a peanut butter

D0T7KwvmFQA,81360,83200,when i was a weak person
D0T7KwvmFQA,83200,85040,these are some of the things i would ask
D0T7KwvmFQA,85040,87439,a very driven person because i didn't
D0T7KwvmFQA,87439,90159,understand what they were doing
D0T7KwvmFQA,90159,93040,because they were so driven that my mind
D0T7KwvmFQA,93040,95600,was so weak that i was like they must
D0T7KwvmFQA,95600,98560,not be happy i would find a way to put a
D0T7KwvmFQA,98560,101520,title like they're crazy or they're not
D0T7KwvmFQA,101520,104240,fulfilled or they're empty
D0T7KwvmFQA,104240,105600,because
D0T7KwvmFQA,105600,108640,i didn't have what they had so basically
D0T7KwvmFQA,108640,110640,if i get these questions
D0T7KwvmFQA,110640,113040,i know i'm exactly where i need to be

D0T7KwvmFQA,119360,121040,i'm a big faith believer even though i
D0T7KwvmFQA,121040,122000,cuss
D0T7KwvmFQA,122000,124000,i'm a big faith believer but god didn't
D0T7KwvmFQA,124000,126000,tell me to rest
D0T7KwvmFQA,126000,127360,when i got through with that first
D0T7KwvmFQA,127360,129599,hundred mile race that i did around that
D0T7KwvmFQA,129599,131280,one mile track that i didn't prepare for
D0T7KwvmFQA,131280,133280,and i was considerably
D0T7KwvmFQA,133280,134720,it was horrible
D0T7KwvmFQA,134720,136480,and i'll never forget
D0T7KwvmFQA,136480,138160,i found
D0T7KwvmFQA,138160,140800,such peace and beauty and i got i was in
D0T7KwvmFQA,140800,142879,the worst pain in my life
D0T7KwvmFQA,142879,144640,and i got done and my wife pulled the
D0T7KwvmFQA,144640,146640,car up on the my ex-wife
D0T7KwvmFQA,146640,148160,pulled the car up on this
D0T7KwvmFQA,148160,150560,little lawn and i got in the back of it
D0T7KwvmFQA,150560,152319,and i got up the stairs i'm not gonna go
D0T7KwvmFQA,152319,153680,through the whole story but i remember
D0T7KwvmFQA,153680,155680,laying in the in the tub
D0T7KwvmFQA,155680,157920,and she put the shower on me
D0T7KwvmFQA,157920,160879,and i ran 101 miles like 19 hours and i
D0T7KwvmFQA,160879,163920,was like peeing dirt out of me
D0T7KwvmFQA,163920,165360,and i'm sitting there and i'm
D0T7KwvmFQA,165360,167760,jackhammering and my body is just the
D0T7KwvmFQA,167760,169760,most broken it's ever been even to this
D0T7KwvmFQA,169760,171200,day
D0T7KwvmFQA,171200,173680,and this feeling came over me
D0T7KwvmFQA,173680,175519,call it crazy if you want but very few
D0T7KwvmFQA,175519,177599,people i guarantee ever felt this before
D0T7KwvmFQA,177599,179760,to push themselves so far outside of
D0T7KwvmFQA,179760,181120,what they thought was even possible even
D0T7KwvmFQA,181120,182159,for me
D0T7KwvmFQA,182159,185120,i laid in that tub and i didn't want it
D0T7KwvmFQA,185120,186080,to go away
D0T7KwvmFQA,186080,187280,[Music]
D0T7KwvmFQA,187280,192319,i had drained myself of every bit of
D0T7KwvmFQA,192319,194879,strength energy i had
D0T7KwvmFQA,194879,196800,and it was the best feeling i had in my
D0T7KwvmFQA,196800,198560,life all that pain it was it was
D0T7KwvmFQA,198560,200159,confirmation
D0T7KwvmFQA,200159,202959,that i had gone through a crucible
D0T7KwvmFQA,202959,205599,and i had figured out another level of
D0T7KwvmFQA,205599,207920,david goggins a level that i thought was
D0T7KwvmFQA,207920,210400,humanly impossible for anybody to do
D0T7KwvmFQA,210400,212159,when i was at mile 70 and pissed all
D0T7KwvmFQA,212159,214640,over myself and had 30 more miles to go
D0T7KwvmFQA,214640,217120,and i was damn near dead
D0T7KwvmFQA,217120,220319,and i was able to go 31 more miles
D0T7KwvmFQA,220319,222400,in that process of the next 31 more
D0T7KwvmFQA,222400,223519,miles
D0T7KwvmFQA,223519,226000,i found out more about myself in that 31
D0T7KwvmFQA,226000,229519,miles than ever have in my entire life
D0T7KwvmFQA,229519,231280,the conversations
D0T7KwvmFQA,231280,233760,the mental blocks the road blocks
D0T7KwvmFQA,233760,236720,everything horrible it was just feeding
D0T7KwvmFQA,236720,238959,at me like light speed get out of here
D0T7KwvmFQA,238959,241360,man like if i was able to figure out
D0T7KwvmFQA,241360,243200,different tactics
D0T7KwvmFQA,243200,244720,and when i finally got done with that i
D0T7KwvmFQA,244720,247120,laid in that tub and it was over
D0T7KwvmFQA,247120,249280,the feeling of my god man you just
D0T7KwvmFQA,249280,250239,really

D0T7KwvmFQA,255040,258000,that guarantee very few people have
D0T7KwvmFQA,258000,260239,so it's a it's a feeling i can't even
D0T7KwvmFQA,260239,262000,describe
D0T7KwvmFQA,262000,263440,there's always a
D0T7KwvmFQA,263440,265919,blockade there's a barrier

D0T7KwvmFQA,267440,269040,you got to find out
D0T7KwvmFQA,269040,271680,what kind of removes that barrier from

D0T7KwvmFQA,272800,275280,my biggest barrier was my father
D0T7KwvmFQA,275280,277440,and once i removed that barrier
D0T7KwvmFQA,277440,279120,i was free
D0T7KwvmFQA,279120,280560,to think
D0T7KwvmFQA,280560,283680,and once i felt good about myself
D0T7KwvmFQA,283680,286080,i was free to put action in
D0T7KwvmFQA,286080,288479,i never felt good about myself
D0T7KwvmFQA,288479,290320,i never felt good by myself whenever i
D0T7KwvmFQA,290320,292000,would get somewhere
D0T7KwvmFQA,292000,293919,the demon would come back put me right
D0T7KwvmFQA,293919,295520,back in the cage

D0T7KwvmFQA,354080,354880,thing
D0T7KwvmFQA,354880,357360,and if you look at life as it is a
D0T7KwvmFQA,357360,360160,trial ground a testing ground
D0T7KwvmFQA,360160,362240,for where you need to belong where you

D0T7KwvmFQA,384960,387120,depressed moments like oh hang on i'm
D0T7KwvmFQA,387120,389440,getting tested so you have to be aware
D0T7KwvmFQA,389440,391680,of all the signals and signs that are
D0T7KwvmFQA,391680,394560,being given to you from the world one of
D0T7KwvmFQA,394560,395600,them
D0T7KwvmFQA,395600,398000,is if you feel bad

D0T7KwvmFQA,399759,401440,perform under that
D0T7KwvmFQA,401440,404560,and that's suffering is a part of life
D0T7KwvmFQA,404560,406160,i invented this thing called the cookie
D0T7KwvmFQA,406160,408240,jar when i was growing up you know how
D0T7KwvmFQA,408240,409360,your mom
D0T7KwvmFQA,409360,411680,we were real poor and she would go by
D0T7KwvmFQA,411680,413360,and get these cheap ass cookies from all
D0T7KwvmFQA,413360,414880,these which is like a generic grocery
D0T7KwvmFQA,414880,416080,store
D0T7KwvmFQA,416080,418479,and like 50 cent cookies and she just
D0T7KwvmFQA,418479,420160,dumped them in this cookie jar
D0T7KwvmFQA,420160,421599,so sometimes you're reaching the cookie
D0T7KwvmFQA,421599,424319,jar and you pull out a of mint cookie
D0T7KwvmFQA,424319,426000,maybe a chocolate chip
D0T7KwvmFQA,426000,428080,maybe a peanut butter
