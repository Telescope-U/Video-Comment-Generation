j2ldtNxzE38,5920,6879,hi
j2ldtNxzE38,6879,10719,i'm aaron and today i am going to be
j2ldtNxzE38,10719,12880,answering the question
j2ldtNxzE38,12880,15519,what is a credit card
j2ldtNxzE38,15519,18400,so i see people paying for things by
j2ldtNxzE38,18400,22320,credit card every day and to be honest i
j2ldtNxzE38,22320,24560,wasn't exactly sure what a credit card
j2ldtNxzE38,24560,25760,was
j2ldtNxzE38,25760,28400,well i know it's a little rectangular
j2ldtNxzE38,28400,31599,piece of plastic but how does it
j2ldtNxzE38,31599,33760,actually work
j2ldtNxzE38,33760,37360,i love solving mysteries so i set myself
j2ldtNxzE38,37360,41520,a mission to find the answer
j2ldtNxzE38,41520,46000,first i asked my mum she said
j2ldtNxzE38,46000,49360,a credit card is a way to pay for things
j2ldtNxzE38,49360,51039,you can use cash
j2ldtNxzE38,51039,53840,a debit card but deduct some money
j2ldtNxzE38,53840,57039,directly from your account or use a
j2ldtNxzE38,57039,58879,credit card
j2ldtNxzE38,58879,61120,the money that you spend
j2ldtNxzE38,61120,63359,goes on to a bill
j2ldtNxzE38,63359,66159,which you have to pay at the end of the
j2ldtNxzE38,66159,67119,month
j2ldtNxzE38,67119,70479,so a credit card is borrowing money
j2ldtNxzE38,70479,74080,a bit like alone
j2ldtNxzE38,74080,77840,then i asked my dad and he said
j2ldtNxzE38,77840,80640,credit cards usually charge you interest
j2ldtNxzE38,80640,82400,to borrow the money
j2ldtNxzE38,82400,85119,you need to pay the balance
j2ldtNxzE38,85119,88400,the money that you spent by the end of
j2ldtNxzE38,88400,91040,the month
j2ldtNxzE38,91119,93680,next it was my gran
j2ldtNxzE38,93680,98400,if you don't pay off the full balance
j2ldtNxzE38,98400,103040,what you owe by the end of the month
j2ldtNxzE38,103040,106240,the credit card company will charge you
j2ldtNxzE38,106240,108560,an interest fee
j2ldtNxzE38,108560,111040,the longer you take to pay the money
j2ldtNxzE38,111040,114960,back the bigger the fee
j2ldtNxzE38,114960,118560,after that my uncle dean came along
j2ldtNxzE38,118560,121520,sometimes you can get an interest free
j2ldtNxzE38,121520,122880,credit card
j2ldtNxzE38,122880,124719,this means i won't charge you any
j2ldtNxzE38,124719,128080,interest for a set time period for
j2ldtNxzE38,128080,129360,example
j2ldtNxzE38,129360,132239,the credit card company might say
j2ldtNxzE38,132239,135520,we won't charge any interest for 12
j2ldtNxzE38,135520,137520,months
j2ldtNxzE38,137520,140160,but then my mom jumped back in
j2ldtNxzE38,140160,141120,yes
j2ldtNxzE38,141120,143360,but you have to remember
j2ldtNxzE38,143360,145840,that if you don't pay off the balance
j2ldtNxzE38,145840,147840,within 12 months
j2ldtNxzE38,147840,150879,then you will start paying interest
j2ldtNxzE38,150879,154400,so you have to be careful
j2ldtNxzE38,154400,158000,back to uncle d credit card companies
j2ldtNxzE38,158000,160720,will also set a credit limit on your
j2ldtNxzE38,160720,163599,account this means that they will only
j2ldtNxzE38,163599,166160,allow you to spend a certain amount of
j2ldtNxzE38,166160,167120,money
j2ldtNxzE38,167120,170160,so if your credit card limit is 500
j2ldtNxzE38,170160,172720,pounds that's all you will be allowed to
j2ldtNxzE38,172720,173840,spend
j2ldtNxzE38,173840,176640,you should always stay well within your
j2ldtNxzE38,176640,178159,limit
j2ldtNxzE38,178159,179280,wow
j2ldtNxzE38,179280,181680,what a lot of information
j2ldtNxzE38,181680,184159,at that point i decided to go hide in my
j2ldtNxzE38,184159,187280,room because my whole family were now
j2ldtNxzE38,187280,190000,getting excited and wanted to tell me
j2ldtNxzE38,190000,191599,more and more
j2ldtNxzE38,191599,194239,i'm sorry but that's enough info for my
j2ldtNxzE38,194239,196560,brain to process after a hard day at
j2ldtNxzE38,196560,197519,school
j2ldtNxzE38,197519,201319,catch you next time
