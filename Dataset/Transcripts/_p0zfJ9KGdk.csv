_p0zfJ9KGdk,2080,3439,maxi scooters have been the most sought
_p0zfJ9KGdk,3439,4799,after vehicle on two wheels here in the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,4799,6560,philippines for quite some time now at
_p0zfJ9KGdk,6560,7960,least that's what the metrics of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,7960,10160,motorville.com.ph tells us and it's easy
_p0zfJ9KGdk,10160,12559,to see why they're comfortable easy to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,12559,14799,ride pretty fuel efficient they got some
_p0zfJ9KGdk,14799,16720,storage space and they're relatively
_p0zfJ9KGdk,16720,18160,good looking but what if you wanted to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,18160,19600,be a little bit different from all the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,19600,23279,nmaxes pcx adv and eric's out there all
_p0zfJ9KGdk,23279,24560,of which by the way we have reviews on
_p0zfJ9KGdk,24560,26640,motodeal.com.ph
_p0zfJ9KGdk,26640,28800,what if you wanted to be a little bit
_p0zfJ9KGdk,28800,30400,more unique
_p0zfJ9KGdk,30400,32960,well perhaps this will tickle your fancy
_p0zfJ9KGdk,32960,36000,it's the aprilia sr gt200 it's time to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,36000,38450,go beyond
_p0zfJ9KGdk,38450,40840,[Applause]

_p0zfJ9KGdk,49130,62320,[Music]
_p0zfJ9KGdk,62320,64478,when one hears the name aprilia usually
_p0zfJ9KGdk,64478,66799,a sport bike comes to mind maybe the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,66799,69360,tuono or the rsv4 and why not that's
_p0zfJ9KGdk,69360,70799,what they've done through the years and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,70799,72080,that's what they've really been known
_p0zfJ9KGdk,72080,74640,for so why would a italian sport bike
_p0zfJ9KGdk,74640,77119,company make a scooter
_p0zfJ9KGdk,77119,79200,well keep in mind that the piaggio group
_p0zfJ9KGdk,79200,81840,owns aprilia and piageo also owns
_p0zfJ9KGdk,81840,84560,perhaps the most recognizable scooter in
_p0zfJ9KGdk,84560,87040,the entire world the one that kind of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,87040,90240,looks like a wasp the sr gt200 is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,90240,92799,powered by a 175 cc single cylinder
_p0zfJ9KGdk,92799,95600,liquid cooled engine that makes 17.4
_p0zfJ9KGdk,95600,97920,horsepower and 16.5 newton meters of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,97920,100159,torque stopping power is provided by
_p0zfJ9KGdk,100159,102079,disc brakes front and back and the bike
_p0zfJ9KGdk,102079,104159,is also equipped with abs
_p0zfJ9KGdk,104159,105840,you do get a pretty significant ground
_p0zfJ9KGdk,105840,108720,clearance of 175 millimeters with 120
_p0zfJ9KGdk,108720,110479,millimeter suspension travel up front
_p0zfJ9KGdk,110479,113040,and 100 millimeter of travel at the back
_p0zfJ9KGdk,113040,115119,which means you'll be able to keep the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,115119,117680,bumps at bay the tires are bigger than
_p0zfJ9KGdk,117680,119920,most scooters out there as the bike sits
_p0zfJ9KGdk,119920,122399,on 14 inches at the front and 13 inches
_p0zfJ9KGdk,122399,124880,at the rear it has dual sport michelins
_p0zfJ9KGdk,124880,127040,which work really well for the roads we
_p0zfJ9KGdk,127040,128399,have in manila
_p0zfJ9KGdk,128399,129679,and beyond
_p0zfJ9KGdk,129679,131280,now because the ground clearance is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,131280,133200,pretty high and the wheels are pretty
_p0zfJ9KGdk,133200,135120,big you would expect the seat height to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,135120,137680,be pretty high as well it is 799
_p0zfJ9KGdk,137680,139920,millimeters which isn't too high when
_p0zfJ9KGdk,139920,141680,you think about it however the seat is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,141680,144160,pretty wide so somebody who is five foot
_p0zfJ9KGdk,144160,146800,six like myself with a 764 millimeter in
_p0zfJ9KGdk,146800,148080,seam
_p0zfJ9KGdk,148080,149120,is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,149120,151200,well that's the way it looks
_p0zfJ9KGdk,151200,153120,kind of tip-toeing
_p0zfJ9KGdk,153120,156239,now you do get leds all around front and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,156239,159599,back with drls as well a non-adjustable
_p0zfJ9KGdk,159599,161920,windscreen which does the job
_p0zfJ9KGdk,161920,163360,you have a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,163360,166239,nice integrated foot pegs into the it's
_p0zfJ9KGdk,166239,167840,integrated into the body so that when
_p0zfJ9KGdk,167840,169840,you're not using them it's nice and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,169840,172080,seamless with the design of the bike
_p0zfJ9KGdk,172080,172879,the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,172879,175040,seat is nice and comfortable nice
_p0zfJ9KGdk,175040,177360,stitching as well
_p0zfJ9KGdk,177360,179599,i mean the fit and finish of the bike is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,179599,181760,really good i mean it does feel like and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,181760,184239,look like a premium scooter however i
_p0zfJ9KGdk,184239,186000,don't love the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,186000,188879,carbon fiber look right here in the body
_p0zfJ9KGdk,188879,190159,part of the bike
_p0zfJ9KGdk,190159,192159,i mean i would have rather it just be
_p0zfJ9KGdk,192159,194480,matte black or glossy black or something
_p0zfJ9KGdk,194480,196959,but i'm not a big fan of the carbon
_p0zfJ9KGdk,196959,198560,fiber
_p0zfJ9KGdk,198560,201040,feel um unless it was real carbon fiber
_p0zfJ9KGdk,201040,202720,of course but you do understand why they
_p0zfJ9KGdk,202720,206480,did it right because aprilia is a sport
_p0zfJ9KGdk,206480,208319,bike company i mean that's what they
_p0zfJ9KGdk,208319,210720,want to do so they want their scooter to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,210720,213280,also have that same type of dna
_p0zfJ9KGdk,213280,215680,i mean i get why they did it but i would
_p0zfJ9KGdk,215680,217200,have preferred something a little bit
_p0zfJ9KGdk,217200,218560,more subtle
_p0zfJ9KGdk,218560,220000,i love the way it looks from the front
_p0zfJ9KGdk,220000,222080,it's aggressive and sporty it kind of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,222080,224400,has that you know sport bike feel i mean
_p0zfJ9KGdk,224400,226640,it is an aprilia but i do i can't
_p0zfJ9KGdk,226640,229360,believe that it's the cousin of a vespa
_p0zfJ9KGdk,229360,231680,they're very different
_p0zfJ9KGdk,231680,232400,but
_p0zfJ9KGdk,232400,237840,equally beautiful equally italian one is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,237840,240400,gianni versace the other one is giorgio
_p0zfJ9KGdk,240400,241439,armani
_p0zfJ9KGdk,241439,243360,to access the gas cap all you got to do
_p0zfJ9KGdk,243360,244239,is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,244239,246640,turn it on and then press the key and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,246640,249280,voila there it is and because it is a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,249280,251439,scooter you do get some decent storage
_p0zfJ9KGdk,251439,253439,space you have this little
_p0zfJ9KGdk,253439,255280,storage space right here with a usb
_p0zfJ9KGdk,255280,256880,socket to charge your phone and other
_p0zfJ9KGdk,256880,259919,gadgets and you also get storage
_p0zfJ9KGdk,259919,262320,underneath the seat
_p0zfJ9KGdk,262320,265280,it's pretty spacious i mean i put my bag
_p0zfJ9KGdk,265280,267199,in there and a water bottle but you
_p0zfJ9KGdk,267199,270160,cannot fit a full face helmet you could
_p0zfJ9KGdk,270160,273120,fit a half face or a quarter face helmet
_p0zfJ9KGdk,273120,274240,but
_p0zfJ9KGdk,274240,275520,i mean
_p0zfJ9KGdk,275520,277280,yeah i don't have one to show that they
_p0zfJ9KGdk,277280,279360,can do it but you can trust me that i've
_p0zfJ9KGdk,279360,281759,seen people do it i love the attention
_p0zfJ9KGdk,281759,283680,to detail that apparently put into the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,283680,286320,design of the bike uh even these little
_p0zfJ9KGdk,286320,288080,things underneath the headlight i don't
_p0zfJ9KGdk,288080,289280,know what they are
_p0zfJ9KGdk,289280,290000,but
_p0zfJ9KGdk,290000,291919,i kind of like the way it looks
_p0zfJ9KGdk,291919,294160,it's you know very very very italian as
_p0zfJ9KGdk,294160,297440,well as these little vents or air ducts
_p0zfJ9KGdk,297440,299680,by the fairings of the scooter
_p0zfJ9KGdk,299680,301520,you can see right through it like hi
_p0zfJ9KGdk,301520,304639,hello hello there and the grab rail is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,304639,307520,nice and sturdy for the pillion to hold
_p0zfJ9KGdk,307520,308840,on to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,308840,310400,um
_p0zfJ9KGdk,310400,312960,i i do love the color i mean i typically
_p0zfJ9KGdk,312960,316320,don't like loud color motorcycles but
_p0zfJ9KGdk,316320,318800,scooters i enjoy them to be a little bit
_p0zfJ9KGdk,318800,321039,more out there a little bit loud because
_p0zfJ9KGdk,321039,322320,you want to be
_p0zfJ9KGdk,322320,323600,you want to have your presence felt on
_p0zfJ9KGdk,323600,326800,the road for safety purposes and this
_p0zfJ9KGdk,326800,329039,i like it i like that it kind of stands
_p0zfJ9KGdk,329039,329919,out
_p0zfJ9KGdk,329919,330880,a lot
_p0zfJ9KGdk,330880,332479,compared to other maxi scooters out
_p0zfJ9KGdk,332479,336560,there you get a nice big lcd screen
_p0zfJ9KGdk,336560,337840,and it tells you all the different
_p0zfJ9KGdk,337840,340479,information that you need um it's also
_p0zfJ9KGdk,340479,342720,telling me that i do need gas now
_p0zfJ9KGdk,342720,344320,speaking of gas the bike also is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,344320,346560,equipped with a start stop system so
_p0zfJ9KGdk,346560,348479,when you're idle or when you're
_p0zfJ9KGdk,348479,350560,in a traffic light the engine turns off
_p0zfJ9KGdk,350560,352960,so you're gonna be able to save fuel
_p0zfJ9KGdk,352960,354720,apparently i didn't do that properly
_p0zfJ9KGdk,354720,355680,because
_p0zfJ9KGdk,355680,357840,i want empty now speaking of fuel you
_p0zfJ9KGdk,357840,360720,get nine liters of fuel tank capacity
_p0zfJ9KGdk,360720,363680,and the kilometers per liter is about 38
_p0zfJ9KGdk,363680,367680,kilometers which is relatively okay for
_p0zfJ9KGdk,367680,369759,a scooter the competition usually will
_p0zfJ9KGdk,369759,372479,see about 40 40 a little bit higher than
_p0zfJ9KGdk,372479,374960,that but that's for the 150 variants of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,374960,377759,the other scooters out there this it's a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,377759,381440,175 cc so you'd expect that to be a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,381440,383520,little bit less fuel efficient but still
_p0zfJ9KGdk,383520,384800,pretty good
_p0zfJ9KGdk,384800,387120,the wet weight is 144 kilograms which
_p0zfJ9KGdk,387120,389199,makes it really easy to maneuver in city
_p0zfJ9KGdk,389199,392240,traffic and the turning radius is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,392240,394560,pretty good look at that which means
_p0zfJ9KGdk,394560,396960,you'll be able to filter
_p0zfJ9KGdk,396960,399280,smoothly and easily
_p0zfJ9KGdk,399280,401600,all right let's do a quick sound test
_p0zfJ9KGdk,401600,403039,why
_p0zfJ9KGdk,403039,404240,well
_p0zfJ9KGdk,404240,406560,it is an aprilia so maybe it will sound
_p0zfJ9KGdk,406560,409759,like a tuono already
_p0zfJ9KGdk,409759,413440,other sport bikes the rsv4
_p0zfJ9KGdk,421680,425000,maybe not
_p0zfJ9KGdk,425390,437840,[Music]
_p0zfJ9KGdk,437840,439840,the seat is nice and comfortable and the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,439840,442240,ergonomics are typical of most maxi
_p0zfJ9KGdk,442240,444319,scooters you can stretch your legs a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,444319,446560,little bit the seat is a little wide and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,446560,448080,it kind of reminds me of the seat of a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,448080,450960,vespa it seems like they're wider than
_p0zfJ9KGdk,450960,453280,those of the japanese counterparts it
_p0zfJ9KGdk,453280,455360,does make me tiptoe a little bit more
_p0zfJ9KGdk,455360,457280,than i'm used to on a scooter but still
_p0zfJ9KGdk,457280,458639,very manageable
_p0zfJ9KGdk,458639,460880,i do like the bigger wheels and tires it
_p0zfJ9KGdk,460880,463280,makes the manila roads much more
_p0zfJ9KGdk,463280,465280,pleasant to ride around him on other
_p0zfJ9KGdk,465280,468560,scooters such as the vespa you will feel
_p0zfJ9KGdk,468560,471039,all the bumps but this manages the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,471039,473520,imperfections of the road so much better
_p0zfJ9KGdk,473520,474759,and because it's got some
_p0zfJ9KGdk,474759,476879,semi-off-roadish tires it would have
_p0zfJ9KGdk,476879,479520,been fun to take this on some dirt roads
_p0zfJ9KGdk,479520,482160,up in the mountain areas not exactly on
_p0zfJ9KGdk,482160,484720,a trail or anything extreme but just on
_p0zfJ9KGdk,484720,487440,some of the beaten path places when you
_p0zfJ9KGdk,487440,488800,think about the competition of the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,488800,491039,scooter it's going up against heavy
_p0zfJ9KGdk,491039,495039,weights such as the nmax pcx aerox adv
_p0zfJ9KGdk,495039,497840,150 to a certain extent it's relative
_p0zfJ9KGdk,497840,500960,vespa price wise anyway and i honestly
_p0zfJ9KGdk,500960,501919,feel
_p0zfJ9KGdk,501919,504560,a little different writing this
_p0zfJ9KGdk,504560,506400,it feels familiar
_p0zfJ9KGdk,506400,509120,but not similar to the other premium
_p0zfJ9KGdk,509120,512399,scooters it's more unique and it it's in
_p0zfJ9KGdk,512399,513518,a way
_p0zfJ9KGdk,513518,516719,a more fun writing experience
_p0zfJ9KGdk,516719,518320,but maybe that's because
_p0zfJ9KGdk,518320,519839,you know it has the name of prelia
_p0zfJ9KGdk,519839,522240,attached to it so in my mind i'm
_p0zfJ9KGdk,522240,524080,expecting you know something a little
_p0zfJ9KGdk,524080,526720,bit quicker a little bit faster a little
_p0zfJ9KGdk,526720,528640,bit race oriented
_p0zfJ9KGdk,528640,530880,um so maybe that's you know there's a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,530880,532800,subliminal thing here that they're doing
_p0zfJ9KGdk,532800,534560,with the scooter i've got to tell you
_p0zfJ9KGdk,534560,536080,i've gotten a lot of looks and stairs
_p0zfJ9KGdk,536080,537519,riding this the past few days a lot of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,537519,539279,guys on an nmax
_p0zfJ9KGdk,539279,540880,or other scooters out there ask me
_p0zfJ9KGdk,540880,542320,questions while i'm stopped in the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,542320,543600,traffic light
_p0zfJ9KGdk,543600,546560,it will grab attention it definitely
_p0zfJ9KGdk,546560,547680,will
_p0zfJ9KGdk,547680,549680,now that traffic has returned to normal
_p0zfJ9KGdk,549680,552160,and gas prices have been pretty high i
_p0zfJ9KGdk,552160,554320,have strongly been considering getting a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,554320,556240,scooter for daily use
_p0zfJ9KGdk,556240,557839,i still love the classic look of the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,557839,560560,vespa but this is really growing on me
_p0zfJ9KGdk,560560,562480,it's really easy to ride and the power
_p0zfJ9KGdk,562480,563920,delivery is not
_p0zfJ9KGdk,563920,566880,jarring but very responsive it won't
_p0zfJ9KGdk,566880,569600,surprise you at all anyone can ride this
_p0zfJ9KGdk,569600,572240,at least anyone who is not significantly
_p0zfJ9KGdk,572240,574880,shorter than i am
_p0zfJ9KGdk,574880,587120,[Music]
_p0zfJ9KGdk,587120,589360,so final thoughts did aprilia do the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,589360,591680,right thing by making this scooter well
_p0zfJ9KGdk,591680,594720,the short answer is yes absolutely maxi
_p0zfJ9KGdk,594720,596399,scooters are here to stay and if you
_p0zfJ9KGdk,596399,597839,want something a little bit more unique
_p0zfJ9KGdk,597839,600080,a little bit more special something

_p0zfJ9KGdk,2080,3439,maxi scooters have been the most sought
_p0zfJ9KGdk,3439,4799,after vehicle on two wheels here in the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,4799,6560,philippines for quite some time now at
_p0zfJ9KGdk,6560,7960,least that's what the metrics of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,7960,10160,motorville.com.ph tells us and it's easy
_p0zfJ9KGdk,10160,12559,to see why they're comfortable easy to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,12559,14799,ride pretty fuel efficient they got some
_p0zfJ9KGdk,14799,16720,storage space and they're relatively
_p0zfJ9KGdk,16720,18160,good looking but what if you wanted to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,18160,19600,be a little bit different from all the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,19600,23279,nmaxes pcx adv and eric's out there all
_p0zfJ9KGdk,23279,24560,of which by the way we have reviews on
_p0zfJ9KGdk,24560,26640,motodeal.com.ph
_p0zfJ9KGdk,26640,28800,what if you wanted to be a little bit
_p0zfJ9KGdk,28800,30400,more unique
_p0zfJ9KGdk,30400,32960,well perhaps this will tickle your fancy
_p0zfJ9KGdk,32960,36000,it's the aprilia sr gt200 it's time to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,36000,38450,go beyond
_p0zfJ9KGdk,38450,40840,[Applause]

_p0zfJ9KGdk,49130,62320,[Music]
_p0zfJ9KGdk,62320,64478,when one hears the name aprilia usually
_p0zfJ9KGdk,64478,66799,a sport bike comes to mind maybe the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,66799,69360,tuono or the rsv4 and why not that's
_p0zfJ9KGdk,69360,70799,what they've done through the years and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,70799,72080,that's what they've really been known
_p0zfJ9KGdk,72080,74640,for so why would a italian sport bike
_p0zfJ9KGdk,74640,77119,company make a scooter
_p0zfJ9KGdk,77119,79200,well keep in mind that the piaggio group
_p0zfJ9KGdk,79200,81840,owns aprilia and piageo also owns
_p0zfJ9KGdk,81840,84560,perhaps the most recognizable scooter in
_p0zfJ9KGdk,84560,87040,the entire world the one that kind of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,87040,90240,looks like a wasp the sr gt200 is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,90240,92799,powered by a 175 cc single cylinder
_p0zfJ9KGdk,92799,95600,liquid cooled engine that makes 17.4
_p0zfJ9KGdk,95600,97920,horsepower and 16.5 newton meters of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,97920,100159,torque stopping power is provided by
_p0zfJ9KGdk,100159,102079,disc brakes front and back and the bike
_p0zfJ9KGdk,102079,104159,is also equipped with abs
_p0zfJ9KGdk,104159,105840,you do get a pretty significant ground
_p0zfJ9KGdk,105840,108720,clearance of 175 millimeters with 120
_p0zfJ9KGdk,108720,110479,millimeter suspension travel up front
_p0zfJ9KGdk,110479,113040,and 100 millimeter of travel at the back
_p0zfJ9KGdk,113040,115119,which means you'll be able to keep the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,115119,117680,bumps at bay the tires are bigger than
_p0zfJ9KGdk,117680,119920,most scooters out there as the bike sits
_p0zfJ9KGdk,119920,122399,on 14 inches at the front and 13 inches
_p0zfJ9KGdk,122399,124880,at the rear it has dual sport michelins
_p0zfJ9KGdk,124880,127040,which work really well for the roads we
_p0zfJ9KGdk,127040,128399,have in manila
_p0zfJ9KGdk,128399,129679,and beyond
_p0zfJ9KGdk,129679,131280,now because the ground clearance is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,131280,133200,pretty high and the wheels are pretty
_p0zfJ9KGdk,133200,135120,big you would expect the seat height to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,135120,137680,be pretty high as well it is 799
_p0zfJ9KGdk,137680,139920,millimeters which isn't too high when
_p0zfJ9KGdk,139920,141680,you think about it however the seat is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,141680,144160,pretty wide so somebody who is five foot
_p0zfJ9KGdk,144160,146800,six like myself with a 764 millimeter in
_p0zfJ9KGdk,146800,148080,seam
_p0zfJ9KGdk,148080,149120,is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,149120,151200,well that's the way it looks
_p0zfJ9KGdk,151200,153120,kind of tip-toeing
_p0zfJ9KGdk,153120,156239,now you do get leds all around front and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,156239,159599,back with drls as well a non-adjustable
_p0zfJ9KGdk,159599,161920,windscreen which does the job
_p0zfJ9KGdk,161920,163360,you have a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,163360,166239,nice integrated foot pegs into the it's
_p0zfJ9KGdk,166239,167840,integrated into the body so that when
_p0zfJ9KGdk,167840,169840,you're not using them it's nice and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,169840,172080,seamless with the design of the bike
_p0zfJ9KGdk,172080,172879,the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,172879,175040,seat is nice and comfortable nice
_p0zfJ9KGdk,175040,177360,stitching as well
_p0zfJ9KGdk,177360,179599,i mean the fit and finish of the bike is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,179599,181760,really good i mean it does feel like and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,181760,184239,look like a premium scooter however i
_p0zfJ9KGdk,184239,186000,don't love the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,186000,188879,carbon fiber look right here in the body
_p0zfJ9KGdk,188879,190159,part of the bike
_p0zfJ9KGdk,190159,192159,i mean i would have rather it just be
_p0zfJ9KGdk,192159,194480,matte black or glossy black or something
_p0zfJ9KGdk,194480,196959,but i'm not a big fan of the carbon
_p0zfJ9KGdk,196959,198560,fiber
_p0zfJ9KGdk,198560,201040,feel um unless it was real carbon fiber
_p0zfJ9KGdk,201040,202720,of course but you do understand why they
_p0zfJ9KGdk,202720,206480,did it right because aprilia is a sport
_p0zfJ9KGdk,206480,208319,bike company i mean that's what they
_p0zfJ9KGdk,208319,210720,want to do so they want their scooter to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,210720,213280,also have that same type of dna
_p0zfJ9KGdk,213280,215680,i mean i get why they did it but i would
_p0zfJ9KGdk,215680,217200,have preferred something a little bit
_p0zfJ9KGdk,217200,218560,more subtle
_p0zfJ9KGdk,218560,220000,i love the way it looks from the front
_p0zfJ9KGdk,220000,222080,it's aggressive and sporty it kind of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,222080,224400,has that you know sport bike feel i mean
_p0zfJ9KGdk,224400,226640,it is an aprilia but i do i can't
_p0zfJ9KGdk,226640,229360,believe that it's the cousin of a vespa
_p0zfJ9KGdk,229360,231680,they're very different
_p0zfJ9KGdk,231680,232400,but
_p0zfJ9KGdk,232400,237840,equally beautiful equally italian one is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,237840,240400,gianni versace the other one is giorgio
_p0zfJ9KGdk,240400,241439,armani
_p0zfJ9KGdk,241439,243360,to access the gas cap all you got to do
_p0zfJ9KGdk,243360,244239,is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,244239,246640,turn it on and then press the key and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,246640,249280,voila there it is and because it is a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,249280,251439,scooter you do get some decent storage
_p0zfJ9KGdk,251439,253439,space you have this little
_p0zfJ9KGdk,253439,255280,storage space right here with a usb
_p0zfJ9KGdk,255280,256880,socket to charge your phone and other
_p0zfJ9KGdk,256880,259919,gadgets and you also get storage
_p0zfJ9KGdk,259919,262320,underneath the seat
_p0zfJ9KGdk,262320,265280,it's pretty spacious i mean i put my bag
_p0zfJ9KGdk,265280,267199,in there and a water bottle but you
_p0zfJ9KGdk,267199,270160,cannot fit a full face helmet you could
_p0zfJ9KGdk,270160,273120,fit a half face or a quarter face helmet
_p0zfJ9KGdk,273120,274240,but
_p0zfJ9KGdk,274240,275520,i mean
_p0zfJ9KGdk,275520,277280,yeah i don't have one to show that they
_p0zfJ9KGdk,277280,279360,can do it but you can trust me that i've
_p0zfJ9KGdk,279360,281759,seen people do it i love the attention
_p0zfJ9KGdk,281759,283680,to detail that apparently put into the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,283680,286320,design of the bike uh even these little
_p0zfJ9KGdk,286320,288080,things underneath the headlight i don't
_p0zfJ9KGdk,288080,289280,know what they are
_p0zfJ9KGdk,289280,290000,but
_p0zfJ9KGdk,290000,291919,i kind of like the way it looks
_p0zfJ9KGdk,291919,294160,it's you know very very very italian as
_p0zfJ9KGdk,294160,297440,well as these little vents or air ducts
_p0zfJ9KGdk,297440,299680,by the fairings of the scooter
_p0zfJ9KGdk,299680,301520,you can see right through it like hi
_p0zfJ9KGdk,301520,304639,hello hello there and the grab rail is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,304639,307520,nice and sturdy for the pillion to hold
_p0zfJ9KGdk,307520,308840,on to
_p0zfJ9KGdk,308840,310400,um
_p0zfJ9KGdk,310400,312960,i i do love the color i mean i typically
_p0zfJ9KGdk,312960,316320,don't like loud color motorcycles but
_p0zfJ9KGdk,316320,318800,scooters i enjoy them to be a little bit
_p0zfJ9KGdk,318800,321039,more out there a little bit loud because
_p0zfJ9KGdk,321039,322320,you want to be
_p0zfJ9KGdk,322320,323600,you want to have your presence felt on
_p0zfJ9KGdk,323600,326800,the road for safety purposes and this
_p0zfJ9KGdk,326800,329039,i like it i like that it kind of stands
_p0zfJ9KGdk,329039,329919,out
_p0zfJ9KGdk,329919,330880,a lot
_p0zfJ9KGdk,330880,332479,compared to other maxi scooters out
_p0zfJ9KGdk,332479,336560,there you get a nice big lcd screen
_p0zfJ9KGdk,336560,337840,and it tells you all the different
_p0zfJ9KGdk,337840,340479,information that you need um it's also
_p0zfJ9KGdk,340479,342720,telling me that i do need gas now
_p0zfJ9KGdk,342720,344320,speaking of gas the bike also is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,344320,346560,equipped with a start stop system so
_p0zfJ9KGdk,346560,348479,when you're idle or when you're
_p0zfJ9KGdk,348479,350560,in a traffic light the engine turns off
_p0zfJ9KGdk,350560,352960,so you're gonna be able to save fuel
_p0zfJ9KGdk,352960,354720,apparently i didn't do that properly
_p0zfJ9KGdk,354720,355680,because
_p0zfJ9KGdk,355680,357840,i want empty now speaking of fuel you
_p0zfJ9KGdk,357840,360720,get nine liters of fuel tank capacity
_p0zfJ9KGdk,360720,363680,and the kilometers per liter is about 38
_p0zfJ9KGdk,363680,367680,kilometers which is relatively okay for
_p0zfJ9KGdk,367680,369759,a scooter the competition usually will
_p0zfJ9KGdk,369759,372479,see about 40 40 a little bit higher than
_p0zfJ9KGdk,372479,374960,that but that's for the 150 variants of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,374960,377759,the other scooters out there this it's a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,377759,381440,175 cc so you'd expect that to be a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,381440,383520,little bit less fuel efficient but still
_p0zfJ9KGdk,383520,384800,pretty good
_p0zfJ9KGdk,384800,387120,the wet weight is 144 kilograms which
_p0zfJ9KGdk,387120,389199,makes it really easy to maneuver in city
_p0zfJ9KGdk,389199,392240,traffic and the turning radius is
_p0zfJ9KGdk,392240,394560,pretty good look at that which means
_p0zfJ9KGdk,394560,396960,you'll be able to filter
_p0zfJ9KGdk,396960,399280,smoothly and easily
_p0zfJ9KGdk,399280,401600,all right let's do a quick sound test
_p0zfJ9KGdk,401600,403039,why
_p0zfJ9KGdk,403039,404240,well
_p0zfJ9KGdk,404240,406560,it is an aprilia so maybe it will sound
_p0zfJ9KGdk,406560,409759,like a tuono already
_p0zfJ9KGdk,409759,413440,other sport bikes the rsv4
_p0zfJ9KGdk,421680,425000,maybe not
_p0zfJ9KGdk,425390,437840,[Music]
_p0zfJ9KGdk,437840,439840,the seat is nice and comfortable and the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,439840,442240,ergonomics are typical of most maxi
_p0zfJ9KGdk,442240,444319,scooters you can stretch your legs a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,444319,446560,little bit the seat is a little wide and
_p0zfJ9KGdk,446560,448080,it kind of reminds me of the seat of a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,448080,450960,vespa it seems like they're wider than
_p0zfJ9KGdk,450960,453280,those of the japanese counterparts it
_p0zfJ9KGdk,453280,455360,does make me tiptoe a little bit more
_p0zfJ9KGdk,455360,457280,than i'm used to on a scooter but still
_p0zfJ9KGdk,457280,458639,very manageable
_p0zfJ9KGdk,458639,460880,i do like the bigger wheels and tires it
_p0zfJ9KGdk,460880,463280,makes the manila roads much more
_p0zfJ9KGdk,463280,465280,pleasant to ride around him on other
_p0zfJ9KGdk,465280,468560,scooters such as the vespa you will feel
_p0zfJ9KGdk,468560,471039,all the bumps but this manages the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,471039,473520,imperfections of the road so much better
_p0zfJ9KGdk,473520,474759,and because it's got some
_p0zfJ9KGdk,474759,476879,semi-off-roadish tires it would have
_p0zfJ9KGdk,476879,479520,been fun to take this on some dirt roads
_p0zfJ9KGdk,479520,482160,up in the mountain areas not exactly on
_p0zfJ9KGdk,482160,484720,a trail or anything extreme but just on
_p0zfJ9KGdk,484720,487440,some of the beaten path places when you
_p0zfJ9KGdk,487440,488800,think about the competition of the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,488800,491039,scooter it's going up against heavy
_p0zfJ9KGdk,491039,495039,weights such as the nmax pcx aerox adv
_p0zfJ9KGdk,495039,497840,150 to a certain extent it's relative
_p0zfJ9KGdk,497840,500960,vespa price wise anyway and i honestly
_p0zfJ9KGdk,500960,501919,feel
_p0zfJ9KGdk,501919,504560,a little different writing this
_p0zfJ9KGdk,504560,506400,it feels familiar
_p0zfJ9KGdk,506400,509120,but not similar to the other premium
_p0zfJ9KGdk,509120,512399,scooters it's more unique and it it's in
_p0zfJ9KGdk,512399,513518,a way
_p0zfJ9KGdk,513518,516719,a more fun writing experience
_p0zfJ9KGdk,516719,518320,but maybe that's because
_p0zfJ9KGdk,518320,519839,you know it has the name of prelia
_p0zfJ9KGdk,519839,522240,attached to it so in my mind i'm
_p0zfJ9KGdk,522240,524080,expecting you know something a little
_p0zfJ9KGdk,524080,526720,bit quicker a little bit faster a little
_p0zfJ9KGdk,526720,528640,bit race oriented
_p0zfJ9KGdk,528640,530880,um so maybe that's you know there's a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,530880,532800,subliminal thing here that they're doing
_p0zfJ9KGdk,532800,534560,with the scooter i've got to tell you
_p0zfJ9KGdk,534560,536080,i've gotten a lot of looks and stairs
_p0zfJ9KGdk,536080,537519,riding this the past few days a lot of
_p0zfJ9KGdk,537519,539279,guys on an nmax
_p0zfJ9KGdk,539279,540880,or other scooters out there ask me
_p0zfJ9KGdk,540880,542320,questions while i'm stopped in the
_p0zfJ9KGdk,542320,543600,traffic light
_p0zfJ9KGdk,543600,546560,it will grab attention it definitely
_p0zfJ9KGdk,546560,547680,will
_p0zfJ9KGdk,547680,549680,now that traffic has returned to normal
_p0zfJ9KGdk,549680,552160,and gas prices have been pretty high i
_p0zfJ9KGdk,552160,554320,have strongly been considering getting a
_p0zfJ9KGdk,554320,556240,scooter for daily use
