sZ_r3z5-DFY,120,3007,- Today we are putting TikTok Tech Hacks to the test.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,3007,6029,That's a lot of Ts. (bell dings)
sZ_r3z5-DFY,6029,7319,(men laugh)
sZ_r3z5-DFY,7320,9430,"TikTok Tech Hacks squad, let's assemble."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,9430,10480,"So because we're boomers,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,10480,12789,can someone please load up our TikToks on the TV?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,12790,15028,- [Automated Voice] Y'all like my new PC?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,15028,16740,(Ken laughs)
sZ_r3z5-DFY,16740,17573,- Yes!
sZ_r3z5-DFY,17573,18930,"- No, it's so disgust, ah."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,18930,20410,It's gonna get so slimy.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,20410,21289,- It's gonna smell good though.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,21289,23010,"- [Automated Voice] Bye, bye, cables."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,23010,25460,"- [Austin] Oh. I mean, this is just an ad."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,25460,26310,- That's not a tech hack.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,26310,28640,"That's literally just a charger, but it's a cool charger."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,28640,30210,- [Man] Now type this number in exactly.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,30210,31043,"Once you type it in,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,31043,32720,you get to the testing screen for the phone.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,32720,34460,"This is where you can test all your sensors,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,34460,36090,"screen, pretty much everything on your phone,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,36090,37400,and make sure everything's working correctly.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,37400,38710,- I've never done that before.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,38710,39543,Let me go.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,39543,40700,- So this is a number that you dial
sZ_r3z5-DFY,40700,42210,when you drop your phone into the pool
sZ_r3z5-DFY,42210,45010,for a little too long and it's working a little sketch.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,45010,49170,"- Star, pound, zero, star, pound."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,49170,50204,"Oh, there we go. Look at that."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,50204,51550,"- [Ken] Ooh, nice."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,51550,52910,"- [Austin] Okay, so red."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,52910,54640,"Ooh, so it's like a screen test."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,54640,56200,"- [Ken] Again, this is diagnostics. So again-"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,56200,57033,- [Austin] Yeah.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,57033,57866,- [Ken] If something happens to your phone
sZ_r3z5-DFY,57866,60076,"and you wanna test a particular thing, it'll-"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,60076,61615,- It's blue.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,61615,62448,- Thank you.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,62448,63540,Your phone can show blue colors.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,63540,64670,"That's it exactly. - Wait, black."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,64670,66189,"- Here, look at black."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,66190,67023,- Or off.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,67023,67856,- And touch.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,69410,71760,"Oh, so it's like a little like calibration tool."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,71760,72960,I've never seen any of this before.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,72960,75810,"- If you're iFixit, you probably have that on"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,75810,77607,"whenever you put a phone back together, right?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,77608,78441,- Yeah.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,78441,79274,- Just to make sure that it's all functioning.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,79274,80653,"- Jared, hit us with a hot TikTok."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,80653,82520,- [Man] What happens if you use deodorant
sZ_r3z5-DFY,82520,84140,instead of thermal paste in your PC?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,84140,85970,- Yo. We gotta do this.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,85970,87260,"Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop watching."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,87260,88093,I don't wanna see. I don't wanna see.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,88093,91460,We've done a lot of stupid things with PCs in the past.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,91460,93650,"We tried to cook on a PC,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,93650,97030,we've used different various bad ideas as thermal paste.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,97030,98812,Deodorant is gonna smell delicious.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,99710,100665,"I mean, delightful."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,100665,101498,(Ken laughs)
sZ_r3z5-DFY,101498,102331,Delightful.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,102331,103820,"- Are you gonna eat it, dude?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,103820,105840,- Delightful is the word I meant.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,105840,106673,Delightful.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,106673,110020,"Ken, I have a need, a need for speed."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,110020,112119,"- Well, thank God we have Speed Stick."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,112120,113870,- The sponsor of today's video. Just kidding.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,113870,115980,"So, for this one, it should be really straightforward."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,115980,119690,We've built a very scientific test bench of a board
sZ_r3z5-DFY,119690,121620,with a Core i3-8100.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,121620,125610,So not exactly the most powerful CPU in the world.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,125610,126443,You just disconnected something.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,126443,127320,- [Jared] What did you do?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,127320,128929,- I heard the Windows disconnecting.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,128929,131370,- I moved it because it was on the edge of the desk.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,131370,133269,- So we should be able to do this pretty simply.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,133270,135250,So we're gonna start out by running Cinebench.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,135250,136930,And then we're gonna take a look at to see exactly
sZ_r3z5-DFY,136930,139250,"how hot it gets, if there's any throttling."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,139250,144250,"Five, four, three, two, one, and complete."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,145520,150520,"So after five minutes, the fan ramped up to 1300 RPM,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,150530,153050,"we had no throttling, and the hottest CPU core"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,153050,154770,touched 62 degrees.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,154770,155603,So that is our benchmark.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,155603,156435,- [Jared] That it pretty cool.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,156436,157860,- That is incredibly cool.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,157860,159850,"This is a older, lower powered processor."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,159850,162810,"So if the deodorant's gonna work with anything,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,162810,164290,this is like the best case scenario.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,164290,166010,"For reference, that's what the thermal paste"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,166010,169420,is supposed to look like on our actual CPU cooler.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,169420,170252,And you can see
sZ_r3z5-DFY,170253,171860,that it's actually a pretty good application here.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,171860,173820,"It was pretty smooth, pretty even."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,173820,176170,So let's wipe this off and put deodorant on it.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,176170,178310,- [Ken] I don't think that that's the best way to do that.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,178310,179720,"- Okay, what do you think we should do?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,179720,183340,- I think you should cut it in chunks and then flat.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,183340,184300,- No!
sZ_r3z5-DFY,184300,185820,What kinda psychopath...
sZ_r3z5-DFY,185820,186653,This is deodorant.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,186653,189160,It is meant to be applied on even strokes.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,189160,189993,You're not gonna like...
sZ_r3z5-DFY,189993,190825,What? No.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,190826,192370,- [Ken] But you're not gonna get enough of it on there.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,192370,193920,"- Oh, watch me. - [Jared] I think he will."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,193920,194752,- Watch me.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,194753,196633,"All right, we'll start with the CPU."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,199112,200194,- [Jared] Ow.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,201930,203349,"- [Ken] Yeah, I think cutting it's the best idea."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,203350,204790,- [Jared] I think he's just gotta put
sZ_r3z5-DFY,204790,206180,a little more TLC in there.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,206180,207069,- [Ken] It smells really good.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,207070,208730,- [Jared] And then if we put some on top of the cooler?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,208730,209659,"- Yeah, yeah."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,209660,211200,"- [Jared] I mean, you don't want that much."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,211200,212427,"- You want a lot, actually."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,212427,213260,"- [Jared] No, you don't want-"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,213260,214092,- The more the better.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,214093,218020,So that's a healthy dose on our CPU cooler
sZ_r3z5-DFY,218020,220880,"and a generous helping on our CPU,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,220880,223720,"which looks a little sus, a little crusty."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,223720,224920,- Looks like you got more of it on the heat sink
sZ_r3z5-DFY,224920,226030,than you did the actual-
sZ_r3z5-DFY,226030,227819,- I'm gonna just touch it up a little bit
sZ_r3z5-DFY,227820,229600,with a couple extra little dips and dabs.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,229600,230433,All right.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,230433,231860,"Well, immediately I'll say this is not good,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,231860,234042,'cause we've not even gotten into the benchmark
sZ_r3z5-DFY,234042,235030,and we're at 78 degrees.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,235030,235862,"I gonna take a guess,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,235863,240750,"we're currently at 97, 98, 99, 100, 100, 100 degrees."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,241930,243489,"- Don't worry guys, I got this, I got this."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,243490,244323,- What's happening right now
sZ_r3z5-DFY,244323,246300,is it is overheating dramatically.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,246300,249000,"So 100 degrees, fan at max"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,249000,251010,and then we have throttled down from 3.6
sZ_r3z5-DFY,251010,252530,to about 3 gigahertz.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,252530,255380,"- But, but we have a Glade plug-in."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,255380,256410,Smell it.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,256410,257510,- It does smell delightful.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,257510,258380,Does anyone want to take a bet
sZ_r3z5-DFY,258380,259940,as what this thing looks like?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,259940,262893,- I think it'll look fresh and clean and masculine.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,262893,263726,- Burnt.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,263726,264559,- And confident.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,264559,265392,- Burnt.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,266440,268223,"- Oh it, look it's, oh my God it dried."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,268223,269620,- [Jared] It melted.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,269620,270460,"- Wait, wait, wait, no, no, look at this."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,270460,271293,"- Oh wait, no."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,271293,274710,"- It's not antiperspirant, it's perspirant."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,274710,276800,- At 100 degrees celsius it melted.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,276800,279280,Just look at little like drops of like liquid
sZ_r3z5-DFY,279280,280555,on the CPU.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,280555,282150,"And look, there's a bunch more on here as well."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,282150,282983,It's like completely melted.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,282983,283816,"- [Jared] So,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,283816,285230,do you think this is still usable as deodorant?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,285230,287200,- I'm not gonna put a hundred degree melted deodorant
sZ_r3z5-DFY,287200,288290,on my armpits.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,288290,289740,- I think you're just afraid.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,290790,293300,"- Oh, it smells so good though, yo."

sZ_r3z5-DFY,353870,354860,- [Man] Here's another iPhone trick
sZ_r3z5-DFY,354860,356400,I guarantee you didn't know about.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,356400,357860,Scroll down and find hearing
sZ_r3z5-DFY,357860,359219,then add it to the control center.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,359220,360800,Click on it and turn live listening on.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,360800,362569,You can now listen to what's being said in any room
sZ_r3z5-DFY,362570,363870,where you leave your phone through your AirPods.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,363870,364760,"- Wait, really?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,364760,365593,"- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,365593,366430,"So with that,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,366430,367830,your AirPods can hear what your iPhone's doing.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,367830,369599,"So if you put your iPhone on another room,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,369600,370770,"as long as you're within Bluetooth range,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,370770,373129,you can hear what's going on in your AirPods?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,373130,375810,"- Well, let's test it out."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,375810,377940,- Can you hear me right now? Can you hear me?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,377940,378773,- Yes.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,378773,380760,- So we obviously can't hear any of this in the video.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,380760,384140,So you're hearing me on the iPhone right now?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,384140,385180,- Yes.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,385180,387669,- Okay. So I'm gonna walk in the back.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,387670,389700,"Hello, Ken. How's it going?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,389700,391390,I'm gonna walk and keep walking.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,391390,392260,Can you hear me?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,392260,393980,"- [Ken] Yes, very well."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,393980,395277,- [Austin] I'm gonna whisper. I'm gonna whisper.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,395277,396580,Can you hear me now?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,396580,397569,"- Yes, you're whispering."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,397570,401010,So this is more or less just a wireless hearing aid.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,401010,404875,Also I'm hearing myself talk and it's messing with me-
sZ_r3z5-DFY,404875,405708,"- [Jared] Yeah, yeah, yeah."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,405708,406541,- Because it's slightly delayed.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,406541,408349,But this is a very good to hearing aid though.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,408350,409680,Like imagine if...
sZ_r3z5-DFY,415645,416780,Either he's demonstrating something
sZ_r3z5-DFY,416780,417710,or he's stealing my phone.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,417710,418690,"- [Austin] Test, test one two."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,418690,421290,So this is a chest to see-
sZ_r3z5-DFY,421290,422986,- He said test wrong. He absolutely said test wrong.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,422986,425492,"- [Austin] Ken, if you can hear me right now, nod your head."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,425493,426326,"- Wait, what?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,426326,427490,"- [Austin] Okay, I don't actually know how I'm testing this"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,427490,429785,'cause I can't see or hear Ken in any way.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,429785,431212,(Ken laughs)
sZ_r3z5-DFY,431212,433177,- He's so dumb. Oh my God.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,435230,436910,- [Man] What happens if you run your computer
sZ_r3z5-DFY,436910,438270,inside of your freezer?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,438270,441900,"- Oh, it's going to die because of condensation, right?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,441900,443550,"Okay, thoughts on this one?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,443550,447280,"If you put your PC in a freezer, it will overheat,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,447280,448440,because even though a freezer
sZ_r3z5-DFY,448440,449600,is like meant to cool things off-
sZ_r3z5-DFY,449600,450620,- [Ken] There's no air circulation.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,450620,452169,"- Well, there's also way more heat"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,452170,454580,that's being released by your PC
sZ_r3z5-DFY,454580,456439,than the freezer could take care of.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,456440,458910,I feel like it's gonna turn into an oven
sZ_r3z5-DFY,458910,459743,at a certain point.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,459743,461060,That would not work.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,461060,462230,- Hello and welcome.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,462230,467230,I am Austin Evans and today we are a fridge PC.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,468060,470727,(upbeat music)
sZ_r3z5-DFY,487530,488363,All right.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,488363,490840,"So we just put the computer in there,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,490840,492030,we're gonna let it sit for a minute
sZ_r3z5-DFY,492030,493220,and let all the parts cool down
sZ_r3z5-DFY,493220,495010,"since they're all still at that room temperature,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,495010,496810,which is well above freezing.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,496810,499490,"Okay, so we're gonna go ahead and run the benchmark now."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,499490,501069,And we only really have one shot at this
sZ_r3z5-DFY,501070,503360,"because once it's warmed up in there,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,503360,505759,"we have a long wait time before it cools back down,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,505760,507180,takes some time.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,507180,508810,We gotta be patient.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,508810,510800,You don't do this if you're in a rush.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,510800,514070,"Well, don't do this at all, but if you're gonna do it,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,514070,515370,make sure you give yourself some time.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,515370,518224,- What are you doing with a PC on the floor?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,518224,521039,You guys shooting a video without me right now?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,521039,522972,"- No, 'cause you're here right now."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,523890,524790,It's not without you.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,524790,526740,- Why is there a bag of ice behind you?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,527700,528533,"- Well, I mean,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,528533,530080,"we didn't have any room in the freezer, so."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,530080,531143,- [Austin] Oh my gosh.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,531143,532800,- It's extra performance.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,532800,533860,And we just got our numbers in.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,533860,535037,Do you want to know how much better it is?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,535037,536160,"- Like, is it even cool in here?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,536160,537272,"- [Jared] Yeah, no, it's cool."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,537272,538105,"- Actually, it is kind of cool in here."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,538105,539630,- See? We think with our heads sometimes.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,539630,541010,- Okay. Does this actually work?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,541010,541960,What are you guys doing?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,541960,543750,- So we just pulled the scores up.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,543750,544583,This is our-
sZ_r3z5-DFY,544583,545416,- That's the same. That's the same
sZ_r3z5-DFY,545416,546897,Having two scores that are the same I guess.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,546897,550069,- So we can see that we have increased our score
sZ_r3z5-DFY,550070,552290,by a solid 80 points.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,552290,555579,"- To really do this test and to see the most benefit,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,555580,556830,you need to be overclocking
sZ_r3z5-DFY,556830,558290,and pushing this where you actually need the cooling.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,558290,559123,- Exactly.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,559123,561420,"Dude, you didn't even mention the fact that"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,561420,562860,now my gaming setup-
sZ_r3z5-DFY,562860,563693,- Yeah.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,563693,564731,- Has a built-in drinks dispenser.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,564731,567180,(both laugh)
sZ_r3z5-DFY,567180,568380,- Only if it's Mountain Dew in there.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,568380,569213,"- Oh, that's-"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,570120,571570,- [Austin] There's no Mountain Dew in there.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,571570,573277,"- We got, oh, oh, oh."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,579998,581399,- I need to get back to actual work.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,581400,582452,Can you please clean this up?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,582452,583285,(Jared laughs)
sZ_r3z5-DFY,583285,584118,Jesus.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,584118,585600,"Oh, okay. I like this."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,585600,588540,- [Man] What happens if you daisy chain multiple PCI risers
sZ_r3z5-DFY,588540,589670,and plug in a graphics card?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,589670,590870,- We use these all the time
sZ_r3z5-DFY,590870,592870,"for all like vertical, like GPU mounts."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,592870,595580,So he was only able to get it to run through one riser
sZ_r3z5-DFY,595580,596640,before it failed.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,596640,599250,"I think if we get actual full 16x risers,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,599250,601880,"which can do full bandwidth for your graphics card,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,601880,604360,"we can get three, four of those things."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,604360,605193,We can get a bunch of them
sZ_r3z5-DFY,605193,607210,that are all gonna be daisy chained together.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,607210,610230,"So for this one, it's going to be interesting."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,610230,611240,I've seen a couple of videos
sZ_r3z5-DFY,611240,612779,"on people trying to do this in the past,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,612780,615210,but what you need to understand about PCI risers...
sZ_r3z5-DFY,615210,616278,What are you doing?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,616278,617520,- It's the edge of the table.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,617520,618400,"- No, it needs to be on the edge,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,618400,619630,'cause it literally will pull out of the slot.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,619630,621140,"Generally speaking, use one of these."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,621140,623420,And using it to like vertically mount your GPU.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,623420,625850,"If you use multiple, you're not really supposed to,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,625850,627639,but I guess if we're building like a desk PC
sZ_r3z5-DFY,627640,629710,where you want to have like the GPU on one side of the desk
sZ_r3z5-DFY,629710,632350,"and like your motherboard on the other, it could be useful."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,632350,634819,- [Ken] You have five PCI risers.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,634820,636030,- Yup.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,636030,637150,- But no power button.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,637150,639000,- Yeah. - Yeah.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,639000,639833,- What's the issue?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,639833,642480,"- You spent $115 per riser,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,642480,644610,but couldn't buy a $2 power button?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,644610,645443,- No.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,645443,646460,"- Wait, wait, wait, wait, to be fair,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,646460,648370,the Corsair ones are least 60.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,648370,649260,"- Guys, wait. But, what's the-"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,649260,651239,"- Yeah, actually why is this one so much more expensive?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,651239,652340,"- Actually, that's a great question."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,652340,653173,- You bought these.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,653173,655170,- I grabbed all Corsair
sZ_r3z5-DFY,655170,656293,and you specifically sent me back.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,656293,657126,"- No, no, no, no, no, no."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,657126,658779,- Look at the difference in the flexibility.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,658780,662030,"Look, see the Thermaltake one is way wimpier."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,662030,663090,"- [Jared] Wait, no, but that's,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,663090,664190,you want it to be flexible.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,664190,665433,"- No, I want it to be-"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,666471,667304,"- [Ken] No, no, no, no."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,667304,668210,- [Jared] Go ahead and say it.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,668210,669450,"Say it out loud, Austin."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,669450,672598,- You versus the guy she tells you not to worry about.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,672598,673431,"- No. No, no, no."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,673431,674309,This is plenty of flexibility.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,674309,675142,(Ken laughs)
sZ_r3z5-DFY,675142,677280,So we've got five feet of risers.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,677280,679340,"- Yeah, I think we might need to go farther than that."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,679340,681630,- I am installed here.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,681630,682700,"Is this a handheld GPU,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,682700,684110,'cause I don't know if that's necessarily a great idea.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,684110,685140,Let's start running it this way.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,685140,687910,"So if the PC's here, we're gonna run it across the table."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,687910,688743,There we go.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,688743,690850,So we're three feet away. GPU's spinning.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,690850,691683,- All right.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,691683,692516,- It's a good sign.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,692516,693349,- It's a very good sign.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,693349,694930,- So far it works.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,694930,696573,Updating? Oh God.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,698050,700480,Windows just wants to update right now.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,700480,701449,"- [Jared] Wait, already?"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,701450,702283,- [Ken] Yeah.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,702283,703116,- [Jared] We just updated it earlier.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,703116,703949,- It's updating your system.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,703949,706479,"All right, let's add two more risers."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,706479,707312,- All right.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,707312,710770,- It's gonna get really annoying really fast.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,710770,712730,- There we are. It is on.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,712730,714220,"- I mean, that's a good first sign."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,714220,715053,- [Ken] Yeah.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,715053,716620,- Let's see if it actually wants to post.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,716620,717970,"Oh, well actually, hang on."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,719250,720757,"- Well, it's also updating right now,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,720757,722251,so that might not be happening.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,722251,723214,"- No, I don't-"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,723215,724048,- I think it's spinning-
sZ_r3z5-DFY,724048,725839,- Nothing's coming up on the display though.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,725840,727030,So is five too many?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,727030,728350,Five might be too many right now.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,728350,731000,Let's go ahead and pull out the fifth riser.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,731000,732099,So let's try it with four first.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,732099,732932,- [Jared] Okay.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,732932,734090,- So will four risers work?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,734090,735850,"Well, I mean GPU immediately spins up,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,735850,736690,which is a good sign.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,736690,737840,And monitor comes up.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,737840,738930,"- Oh, there we go."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,738930,739763,Oh.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,740960,741980,- What the? Oh!
sZ_r3z5-DFY,741980,742873,"- Oh, honey."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,744181,745520,- Whoa!
sZ_r3z5-DFY,745520,746690,- That's a chungus right there.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,746690,749380,"So now we're running with one, two, three,"
sZ_r3z5-DFY,749380,752410,four 300 mil risers and one meter riser.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,752410,753243,- [Jared] Yes.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,754860,755779,- Ooh. Oh!
sZ_r3z5-DFY,755780,756613,Oh!
sZ_r3z5-DFY,756613,757680,- Whoa!
sZ_r3z5-DFY,757680,759588,- So that's it. So how far are we away right now?
sZ_r3z5-DFY,759588,760421,- No way.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,760421,763290,"So we're 1200 plus, so we're 2200 right now."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,763290,767230,- 2200 millimeters away from our motherboard
sZ_r3z5-DFY,767230,768529,and the GPU is spinning.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,768530,771250,I think this is a success. And that's pretty far away.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,771250,774750,"- It is 86 inches long, which is just over seven feet."
sZ_r3z5-DFY,774750,775820,So it is-
sZ_r3z5-DFY,775820,776653,- That's like-
sZ_r3z5-DFY,776653,778980,- [Jared] It's taller than Master Chief is.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,778980,780652,- Our riser's taller than Master Chief.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,780653,781486,- [Jared] Yes.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,781486,782813,- That's a great frame of reference that everyone knows.
sZ_r3z5-DFY,782813,783646,- [Jared] Yeah.
