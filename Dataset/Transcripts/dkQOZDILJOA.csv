dkQOZDILJOA,252560,258239,go but we're now in our little car we've  got this fiat 500 thing it's not fiat  500 it's like a big fee at 500 i don't

dkQOZDILJOA,319199,325360,the day oh no i don't know if the camera  picks it up obviously the lake like  reflects all the lights from
dkQOZDILJOA,325360,331520,around the whole kind of shoreline of  the lake and looks so nice so i think  tomorrow the plan is that we're actually
dkQOZDILJOA,331520,336639,i don't think i'm in focus  that we're gonna head off in the  afternoon and make our way towards
dkQOZDILJOA,336639,342000,bologna and florence with a few stops  kind of on the way but in the morning  we're going to hire a boat if you've
dkQOZDILJOA,342000,349360,seen any of our other vlogs when we're  on holiday we love hiring a bow so we're  going to do that tomorrow so we pick up  the boat tomorrow at like 10 30 a.m
dkQOZDILJOA,349360,356000,and we're just gonna  drive around the lake see what there is  to see so i'm excited about that but for  now we're just gonna have a cup of tea
dkQOZDILJOA,356000,362000,head to bed and i'll pick up with you  guys in the morning good morning  you're gonna have to excuse my voice  today because i've actually got a
dkQOZDILJOA,362000,367680,slightly sore throat but i've just been  sat on the balcony and now kenny is  through here just preparing
dkQOZDILJOA,367680,372960,some breakfast we've got our bread  i'm just making my cup of tea and it's

dkQOZDILJOA,390319,396160,the shop downstairs some artichokes and  then strawberries on the side and  kenny's got the same but with egg
dkQOZDILJOA,396160,402400,and we get to look at this view the  lake's actually really quite clear isn't  it  look at that water that is quite clear
dkQOZDILJOA,402400,408240,we're just picking up our boat now  it's just coming around also look at  these seaplanes they've got seaplanes
dkQOZDILJOA,408240,413919,all over the lake  um and they like land in the lake and  then take off again
dkQOZDILJOA,413919,420820,it's got a cool boat you can really get  like the scale of it when you're down  here  this is our boat guys
dkQOZDILJOA,420820,429120,[Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,429120,444499,this is  [Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,444560,455360,this is  [Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,455360,460720,so just down at the bottom there is  literally where we got off the boat and  as soon as we're off this is where we're
dkQOZDILJOA,460720,466800,going for lunch this is where the guy at  the airbnb recommended he said it's like  the most local place
dkQOZDILJOA,466800,473840,um and then for kenny all the fish is  literally from  the lake just down there they bring it  in in the morning so we've just got our
dkQOZDILJOA,473840,479599,lunch this actually does have lil  fishing which i didn't realize so i'll  just give them to kenny and then
dkQOZDILJOA,479599,486319,kenny's is some kind of creamy smoked  fish though it looks really good just a  small seafood platter for kenny all from
dkQOZDILJOA,486319,493840,the lake  so this is the entrance to our new bed
dkQOZDILJOA,493840,498400,and breakfast that we're staying at it's  so pretty here
dkQOZDILJOA,499120,505039,the gardens around the back i'll show  you later  and this is where you come in this is  the room when you first come in that's
dkQOZDILJOA,505039,511840,just all of our stuff the wallpaper is a  lot  but kind of cute i suppose kind of maybe
dkQOZDILJOA,511840,518719,it's authentic i don't know then we've  got this desk area and then actually got  the stairs we've got a wardrobe area
dkQOZDILJOA,518719,525120,we've got the bathroom which kenny is  currently occupying and then this is our  bedroom we've got a bath in our bedroom
dkQOZDILJOA,525120,532560,it's actually super nice this place guys  was a hundred pounds for the night  um it's just a b and b just outside
dkQOZDILJOA,532560,539440,palmer but i would highly recommend  looking at b and b's and um  airbnbs as well we just got this on
dkQOZDILJOA,539440,546720,booking.com but this is the view outside  the window and apparently i have read  online that the breakfast is amazing the
dkQOZDILJOA,546720,552399,lady here gave us these recommendations  for dinner so we're going to look them  up and see what looks good we're just
dkQOZDILJOA,552399,558080,sat by the pool it's just us too it's  really quiet here  having some crisps and we've made a new  friend
dkQOZDILJOA,558080,565760,this is zoe  [Applause]  zoey  who i think might want our crisps
dkQOZDILJOA,565760,571120,okay either you really like us or you  really like crisps and i don't know  which one it is um
dkQOZDILJOA,571120,577920,yeah  we just got ready for dinner i'm just  wearing my long cos dress and then the  sarah blazer um and we're gonna head
dkQOZDILJOA,577920,584000,into town we don't have anywhere booked  but we do have our list of  recommendations and i guess we're just  gonna walk around and see what looks
dkQOZDILJOA,584000,589680,good i can't get over how pretty it is  out here  so nice just such a random airbnb that i
dkQOZDILJOA,589680,596480,booked and turned out to be  a really good one  we've just come into the center of  palmer and so far i'd say it's probably
dkQOZDILJOA,596480,603360,my favorite place we've been  everywhere is super busy even though  it's only a wednesday not too many
dkQOZDILJOA,603360,609440,tourists we don't think  i didn't really expect much from palmer  but i am loving it
dkQOZDILJOA,609440,616320,this is actually probably like  the cleanest  nicest feeling city or town we've been
dkQOZDILJOA,616320,621600,to so far we're just having a little  aperol spritz before we go to dinner
dkQOZDILJOA,623280,628959,[Music]  kenny and i have just got two small
dkQOZDILJOA,628959,634640,can you call some european beers and  we're just gonna go to dinner  and we're gonna go to dinner at this
dkQOZDILJOA,634640,640320,really cool place um soon this is where  we've chosen to have dinner it comes
dkQOZDILJOA,640320,645560,very highly recommended and it's really  cute on the inside i'll show you guys
dkQOZDILJOA,645560,652480,[Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,652480,661849,uh  [Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,662000,667440,so  we need to have a bit of a chat i went  to bed the first night we were in palmer
dkQOZDILJOA,667440,673200,and i woke up in the morning and i'd had  this allergic reaction  to i don't know it could be something
dkQOZDILJOA,673200,678240,i'd eaten it could be  like the i don't know i really have no
dkQOZDILJOA,678240,684399,idea all under here was swollen like  actually my whole face to be honest to  begin with was like swollen out here and
dkQOZDILJOA,684399,691040,it had this like red i guess of maybe  like a rash or i don't know but i  basically woke up with that the f the
dkQOZDILJOA,691040,696399,morning after we arrived in palmer so as  you guys can imagine i really didn't  feel like picking up the camera and
dkQOZDILJOA,696399,703040,filming my face i did actually film in  everywhere we've been so i filmed in  modern and i did film in bologna as well
dkQOZDILJOA,703040,709279,but i wanted to jump in here because  there's not it might be a bit kind of  disjointed and there's probably no clips
dkQOZDILJOA,709279,714480,i don't i'm not sure but i don't think  there'll be any clips at all of me  speaking so i don't know how much it
dkQOZDILJOA,714480,720480,will make sense but i definitely want to  put those clips in because otherwise  that's like a big chunk of our trip that  we've missed and we did some amazing
dkQOZDILJOA,720480,726639,stuff there so i'm going to slot all of  that footage in now but i just wanted to  jump in and explain because
dkQOZDILJOA,726639,731920,yeah otherwise you might be like why  have we not seen her face for basically  like two three days we just sat outside
dkQOZDILJOA,731920,739519,on the terrace having breakfast  this is all kenny's  and then this is the setting
dkQOZDILJOA,739519,744880,it's so pretty i don't think i actually  showed you the grounds yesterday so just  to quickly show you
dkQOZDILJOA,744880,750959,this is obviously the back of the  b and b  and they've got all these gardens and
dkQOZDILJOA,750959,756800,they go around the side it's so  beautiful here  yeah it's just a type of plant
dkQOZDILJOA,756800,767519,and then yeah this is the pool around  here it's so pretty  [Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,767519,772740,i really really really love it here i'd  recommend anyone to come
dkQOZDILJOA,772740,786079,[Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,786079,791360,we've just driven to i think it's like  the oldest producer of balsamic vinegar
dkQOZDILJOA,791360,796959,in italy if not the world since 1605 it  says and i think you can do like a
dkQOZDILJOA,796959,802800,balsamic vinegar tour here oh it's  actually really cute here we just  finished the balsamic tour and now we've
dkQOZDILJOA,802800,808240,come into  the center of modern air it was really  really interesting and yeah now we're
dkQOZDILJOA,808240,813160,just having an explore of the  town
dkQOZDILJOA,813890,822240,[Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,822240,828639,so this is kenny's this is bolognese  then i basically just got sides at this  place so i got some potatoes which is
dkQOZDILJOA,828639,833920,super good actually this is chicory um  and then grilled vegetables and then
dkQOZDILJOA,833920,839040,kenny's also got tortellini which is  like a local speciality but they all had  cheese in sadly i'm heading off to
dkQOZDILJOA,839040,844800,bologna today so i'll take you guys  along and then hopefully tomorrow we'll  be back fully on
dkQOZDILJOA,844800,859450,the vlogging fun  [Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,864000,870800,we've just stopped to have some lunch um  at this place and it's it's vegan and  vegetarian and it looks really good i've
dkQOZDILJOA,870800,876320,got two beers and we're just waiting for  the food to come this is what i ordered  because i was just craving some veggies
dkQOZDILJOA,876320,883440,and then kenny this is also vegan it's  pumpkin and mushroom tortellini or is  that tortelloni which one went to this
dkQOZDILJOA,883440,889120,organic gelato place and they had like  two full menus of vegan options so this
dkQOZDILJOA,889120,894399,is a chocolate hazelnut what'd you call  it sorbet kind of thing it's really  really good we've just come and had a
dkQOZDILJOA,894399,898279,drink i had a lamborgh
dkQOZDILJOA,900720,906800,which is down the same street we showed  you earlier but obviously  super busy now because it's um the
dkQOZDILJOA,906800,912160,evening  so we have just arrived in florence the  hotel here is absolutely beautiful i'll
dkQOZDILJOA,912160,919360,show you around the room and the hotel  in a second plan for today is just to  enjoy the pool because we've not had any
dkQOZDILJOA,919360,924880,like pool chill time so far it's been  very much like a traveling trip so go  into the city have a look around it
dkQOZDILJOA,924880,929920,looks absolutely beautiful i can't wait  to kind of explore it a bit more so let  me start by showing you around the room
dkQOZDILJOA,929920,935920,so this is the room as you first come in  you've just got this kind of wardrobe  area and then it comes around here to
dkQOZDILJOA,935920,941440,like a tea and coffee area and then the  bathrooms through here
dkQOZDILJOA,941440,947600,then in here the bedroom's really really  pretty it's kind of like  i don't know it looks kind of french but
dkQOZDILJOA,947600,952880,i guess it must be italian and then  out of the windows actually a really
dkQOZDILJOA,952880,958000,nice view  um  across the city and then
dkQOZDILJOA,958000,963839,are they they're alphanines these  mountains apparently have something to  do with what is that it creates like a
dkQOZDILJOA,963839,970959,microclimate for  the emilia romano region which is not  where we are now
dkQOZDILJOA,970959,977040,but that's why they're  that's why they have um really good food  there this is the outside of the hotel
dkQOZDILJOA,977040,982800,it's called  villa cena something it's actually just  like a 10 minute walk from town town is
dkQOZDILJOA,982800,989120,up that way so i'll go inside and show  you  when you come through these doors you've
dkQOZDILJOA,989120,996480,got kind of like the first entrance hall  and then up there is a spa  and through here is the reception
dkQOZDILJOA,996480,1003519,so this is then like the second kind of  entrance room in here  i think this is like a store and then
dkQOZDILJOA,1003519,1010240,through there you can see through to the  pool i really like like a dark interior  and then through here it's so beautiful
dkQOZDILJOA,1010240,1015040,down by the pool i'll quickly run  outside and show you
dkQOZDILJOA,1019040,1024480,and then this is all  just spaces to kind of chill hello and
dkQOZDILJOA,1024480,1029600,yeah  i'm not going to film too much outside  because obviously everyone's in a bikini  it might be a bit
dkQOZDILJOA,1029600,1038600,of an invasion of their privacy through  there's the bar  that's like the downstairs of the hotel
dkQOZDILJOA,1039600,1046640,i guess this is kind of like it's got  gucci and todd's and some other  designers i guess this is kind of the  designer event we found this juice bar
dkQOZDILJOA,1046640,1052799,that does actually does loads of like  vegan options as well but i am just  having i'll zoom you in having one of
dkQOZDILJOA,1052799,1059200,these detox cheeses  [Applause]  there's vegan banana bread up there and  then over there there's like sandwiches
dkQOZDILJOA,1059200,1065919,and stuff but good luck  this is what the place is called and  it's like right in the middle basically
dkQOZDILJOA,1065919,1071280,and this is my juice  look how impressive it is
dkQOZDILJOA,1072240,1077559,honestly that's actually really  something special
dkQOZDILJOA,1080000,1085600,so from the outside it's kind of like  very unassuming and it's a bit out of  the main kind of touristy bits the
dkQOZDILJOA,1085600,1092160,streets are a bit emptier but then like  as you guys can see it's completely full  head oh yes
dkQOZDILJOA,1092320,1101200,four cheese you were something else you  are  they have one that's vegan it's like  potatoes aubergine sun-dried tomatoes
dkQOZDILJOA,1101200,1108240,spinach  um and hot sauce  so i'll let you know how oh and  mushrooms i think only got four cheese
dkQOZDILJOA,1108240,1115520,nothing but cheese in yours  excuse me um we're on the hunt
dkQOZDILJOA,1115520,1122559,for a wine window that's actually open  because that's like the thing in  florence or it used to be the thing  um kenny said apparently they made these
dkQOZDILJOA,1122559,1127600,during the plague so during coronavirus  they reopened some of them but i sadly
dkQOZDILJOA,1127600,1134840,think  it's used this one has not reopened
dkQOZDILJOA,1135050,1141520,[Music]  this bridge is so cool kenny and i were
dkQOZDILJOA,1141520,1147520,just saying dragon people there's rolex  in the middle of the bridge do you see  that  we were saying do you reckon people
dkQOZDILJOA,1147520,1154080,living there or  what's the deal  oh i really love florence this is on the
dkQOZDILJOA,1154080,1161740,bridge it's a bit um full of tourists  but it's pretty cool  [Applause]
dkQOZDILJOA,1161840,1182910,look at the view through the back of the  store guys  [Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,1183200,1194320,uh  [Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,1194320,1199520,we just got back to the hotel had a  maybe had a small nap for like 20  minutes
dkQOZDILJOA,1199520,1207280,and now we're gonna head downstairs and  go to the pool we just sat outside now  we're gonna order  a drink and this is what it looks like
dkQOZDILJOA,1207280,1213120,by the pool  it's all in the shade now apart from  over there we might go sit over there on  that ledge
dkQOZDILJOA,1213120,1219360,just get some last evening sun i've just  been getting ready for dinner and this  is what kenny's doing watching the
dkQOZDILJOA,1219360,1225200,stanley teaching about florence to see  if we've missed anything i think my skin  is finally starting to clear up i like
dkQOZDILJOA,1225200,1231600,exfoliated away some of the dry damaged  skin  so i'm feeling so much better now we're
dkQOZDILJOA,1231600,1238159,gonna head into town i think tonight the  plan of action i still sound sick don't  know i don't feel it plan of action is
dkQOZDILJOA,1238159,1245039,we're gonna go  first to a vegan restaurant there are  loads of vegan restaurants by the way in  florence just because obviously it has
dkQOZDILJOA,1245039,1250480,been really difficult for me to avoid  things like dairy and stuff and even  when you ask for it without dairy
dkQOZDILJOA,1250480,1256960,there's been some occasions where i'm  like this definitely has cheese in so i  just want a big healthy plate that i  know is vegan i've just like vegetables
dkQOZDILJOA,1256960,1264000,and getting a bit of nutrition um and  then we're going to go somewhere for  kenny and i'll maybe have some pasta or
dkQOZDILJOA,1264000,1270559,something as well there i am just  wearing this like little frilly mini  dress which is just from zara it's got
dkQOZDILJOA,1270559,1277049,this low back  [Music]
dkQOZDILJOA,1277760,1284640,so we've just come to this vegan  vegetarian restaurant it was actually  right next to our hotel  um this is what it's called and they've
dkQOZDILJOA,1284640,1289679,just brought us out this which is must  be some kind of nibbles i've got wine  kenny's got beer
dkQOZDILJOA,1289679,1294960,what do you think that is in the middle  it's like vegan cheese and then hummus  maybe and  something
dkQOZDILJOA,1294960,1300640,i guess we'll find out my pasta's just  arrived which is tomato and olive pasta  which looks amazing and then this
dkQOZDILJOA,1300640,1307520,obviously vegan cheese and then i also  ordered this is quinoa and and like an  asparagus sauce it looks really good
dkQOZDILJOA,1307520,1314880,you're gonna have the first try go on  let me know if it's any good  [Applause]
dkQOZDILJOA,1314880,1321600,that's like leaner  vegan vegetarian or not this place is  honestly delicious  i have no idea like how they make this
dkQOZDILJOA,1321600,1327760,or what this is but it is  insane kenny has also got do you  remember the name or do you know
dkQOZDILJOA,1327760,1334640,no but anyway it looks sensational it  looks like creamy pasta i'll definitely  be having a fork full of this although  i'm so full and then i also ordered some
dkQOZDILJOA,1334640,1340400,of these cannellini beans they're not  called that here um but it's cannellini  beans and a tomato sauce and then the
dkQOZDILJOA,1340400,1347360,final thing that we've ordered is just  some grilled veg  just to get the vegetarian but  everything has been so good do you see
dkQOZDILJOA,1347360,1355840,this thing on the floor here this tiny  stick it just fell  [Applause]  [Laughter]
dkQOZDILJOA,1355840,1362080,it just fell out of this tree  right into this and splashed oil all
dkQOZDILJOA,1362080,1368080,over my white dress so brilliant look at  this  so now i'm gonna have to go and change
dkQOZDILJOA,1368080,1374640,thanks to this  just have to run home for a quick outfit  change thanks to the tree situation
dkQOZDILJOA,1374640,1380159,i just put on this suit that i wear  literally all the time and  my trainers and now we're gonna head
dkQOZDILJOA,1380159,1385200,back out and go get a drink somewhere  good morning  thank you
dkQOZDILJOA,1385200,1391039,um this building at night looks even  more surreal it kind of it honestly  looks like a painting doesn't have a
dkQOZDILJOA,1391039,1396640,better night you know  we've just come for  kenny to get some dinner so obviously
dkQOZDILJOA,1396640,1403520,both of these are his because i ate so  much earlier i could not eat a thing so  this is like basically aubergine with
dkQOZDILJOA,1403520,1409360,cheese with parmesan and this is  truffles  tagliatelle
dkQOZDILJOA,1409360,1416960,we've just got back to the hotel and  come on to the terrace at the top  and we've realised that this building do
dkQOZDILJOA,1416960,1422960,you see this white building at the top  here  this is our hotel that we're staying in  tomorrow night
dkQOZDILJOA,1422960,1429279,and apparently it's got amazing views of  florence it's called villa cora um i  don't actually think that is the hotel
dkQOZDILJOA,1429279,1436640,we've discovered that  we've discovered that you can see that  from  the hotel so our hotel is somewhere up
dkQOZDILJOA,1436640,1443279,there but we thought it was that but  we're wrong anyway i'm gonna we're gonna  go into the bedroom now
dkQOZDILJOA,1443279,1449200,and um just rest that on your shoulder  tomorrow is an ultimate day or not
dkQOZDILJOA,1449200,1456080,no no no  still got two more days and then one  kind of like full half day anyway we'll  speak to you guys in the morning night
dkQOZDILJOA,1456080,1461120,good morning  we're actually changing hotel today  again we've not stayed more than one
dkQOZDILJOA,1461120,1467840,night in a hotel this whole trip so  that's been chaotic we're just on the  drive up to the new hotel now but how
dkQOZDILJOA,1467840,1473679,pretty are these streets  this is the hotel over on this side i'll  try and show you the front view at some
dkQOZDILJOA,1473679,1479279,point because it is beautiful  so we're just pulling in
dkQOZDILJOA,1479279,1484799,now  wow  so pretty
dkQOZDILJOA,1484799,1492320,it's all like very there's loads of  parks and trees and stuff around us  as well and it overlooks the um the city
dkQOZDILJOA,1492320,1498799,oh god it's beautiful  i think our room's in that thing by the  way
dkQOZDILJOA,1498799,1504400,i think it is i think i saw that  i thought she's absolutely stunning here
dkQOZDILJOA,1504400,1509679,so um we've just checked in and our  room's not quite ready yet because we're  a little bit early to check in so you've
dkQOZDILJOA,1509679,1514799,just come down to the pool and we're  just gonna relax here until our room's  ready let me show you
dkQOZDILJOA,1514799,1520799,oh there's a dog so this is obviously  the main building where we checked in  and this is some rooms over here try not
dkQOZDILJOA,1520799,1527200,to film anyone and then this is like the  restaurant area which goes around to  here not a bad spot this is my salad
dkQOZDILJOA,1527200,1534320,that i bought earlier for lunch so it's  quinoa and chickpeas and avocado and  sweet potato and lots of goodness so i'm
dkQOZDILJOA,1534320,1539919,just gonna sit here  eat this and enjoy being by the pool  we've just come in to explore the hotel
dkQOZDILJOA,1539919,1545279,and  oh wow i have never seen anything
dkQOZDILJOA,1545279,1551840,this intricate in my life  it is beautiful kenny's in here with no  shoes on so that's disrespectful that's
dkQOZDILJOA,1551840,1556200,fine  and then
dkQOZDILJOA,1557039,1564000,just everywhere you look is just  beautiful  there's like a terrace out there
dkQOZDILJOA,1564000,1570320,kenny's just walking through as if this  is his home  let's have a look out here shall we so
dkQOZDILJOA,1570320,1577840,stunning here  so beautiful  just cannot get over this room
dkQOZDILJOA,1578000,1584799,crazy  we've just got into the room so let me  show you around so this is the entrance
dkQOZDILJOA,1584799,1591679,hall and then through here we have the  bathroom which just has this like nice  big shower and then over here which i
dkQOZDILJOA,1591679,1597360,love they have like a pink robe with a  with pink slippers and the rose for  women which i just think is really nice
dkQOZDILJOA,1597360,1603440,bathroom nice big spacious bathroom  really good shower actually  and then through here
dkQOZDILJOA,1603440,1608799,is our bedroom  which is super pretty as well
dkQOZDILJOA,1608799,1613919,and they've left us  some chocolate strawberries
dkQOZDILJOA,1613919,1620480,and then out here look at that view  such a beautiful view we're just going
dkQOZDILJOA,1620480,1626559,up to the reef terrace to have a look  from there  but i imagine the view from our room is  probably going to be pretty much the
dkQOZDILJOA,1626559,1634080,same this is kind of like all the  corridors or the network of all the  rooms  they've just done it so beautifully here
dkQOZDILJOA,1634080,1641840,it's kind of like traditional classic  but also  modern you know at the same time
dkQOZDILJOA,1643440,1648799,look at the view from up here guys  that's the pool obviously that we're  just at and then i think this is more
dkQOZDILJOA,1648799,1653840,guest streams in that separate building  there and then this is what i meant when  i said it's surrounded the whole hotel
dkQOZDILJOA,1653840,1659360,is surrounded by  just that kind of parks and trees and  then yeah the view
dkQOZDILJOA,1659360,1665600,is crazy  we've just got ready for dinner i'll
dkQOZDILJOA,1665600,1671360,show you my outfit in just one hot suck  um so we're gonna head into town now
dkQOZDILJOA,1671360,1677600,it's quite early because we want to make  the most of our final evening in  florence and kind of go to a few bars
dkQOZDILJOA,1677600,1684159,get some dinner i think we're gonna do  what we did last night in terms of going  to somewhere that serves like vegan
dkQOZDILJOA,1684159,1689919,options for me for us and then probably  doing somewhere a bit later just for  kenny also sorry but i just cannot get
dkQOZDILJOA,1689919,1695520,over this  view and these curtains it's just so  beautiful especially now you've got like
dkQOZDILJOA,1695520,1701919,the evening sun i was saying to kenny  would it not be the most amazing place  to get married so it would actually be
dkQOZDILJOA,1701919,1707120,incredible  you could have like the reception on the  roof terrace it would just be ridiculous
dkQOZDILJOA,1707120,1712480,get married down here  we're just sitting on the roof having a  glass of prosecco thought you're gonna
dkQOZDILJOA,1712480,1719120,cheers me then and um enjoying the  evening view out here  this is kenny pretending to be drunk
dkQOZDILJOA,1719120,1725760,after two glasses of prosecco  very dramatic yeah she did a very good  job it's probably because he's not
dkQOZDILJOA,1725760,1731200,joking  [Laughter]  we just came to this place don't know if  you can see that it's called angie's pub
dkQOZDILJOA,1731200,1737279,i feel like it's a very local vibe just  random place and we finished our drinks  but i had lemoncello soda kenny had half
dkQOZDILJOA,1737279,1742799,a beer and now he wants to go across the  road to this place because apparently  they have proper coffee and have a quick
dkQOZDILJOA,1742799,1748559,espresso before dinner okay so we just  came for dinner um and there nearly  wasn't a table but they managed to sit
dkQOZDILJOA,1748559,1754080,us  right in the window here as long as that  as long as we're quick they said um but
dkQOZDILJOA,1754080,1759919,it's really weird it's like kind of in i  don't know it looks like a book shop but  out there there's the most beautiful  conservatory kind of area i'll try and
dkQOZDILJOA,1759919,1767120,show you later um but the menu looks  really really good so  i am thinking i'm going to have this
dkQOZDILJOA,1767120,1774080,um ragu which is made with lentils which  looks really good kenny is going to get  this salad because he'll eat again later
dkQOZDILJOA,1774080,1779760,and we'll share  and then i'm also going to get  this tortelloni because it's the first
dkQOZDILJOA,1779760,1785760,tortelloni that i've been able to eat on  this trip  and that's the plan got some avocado i  think it's on a hummus with a tiny
dkQOZDILJOA,1785760,1792960,little bit of token salad and then they  bought us some bread and then we've got  our wine this is the lentil ragu with
dkQOZDILJOA,1792960,1799679,tagliatelle and then this is the  tortelloni which i can't remember what's  inside it's like ginger and something
dkQOZDILJOA,1799679,1805919,but it looks really really good  okay update both are very good  this is kelly's favorite and this is by
dkQOZDILJOA,1805919,1811679,far my favorite is  delicious like so so yummy
dkQOZDILJOA,1814159,1819600,we just got to the second restaurant so  this is kind of a bit more for kenny but  it turns out actually we did walk
dkQOZDILJOA,1819600,1824720,through this square earlier do you  remember this and i said oh this looks  nice maybe yesterday
dkQOZDILJOA,1824720,1830080,oh yeah  well anyway it looks really nice there  um this restaurant has got amazing
dkQOZDILJOA,1830080,1835440,reviews so we will let you know but  turns out i definitely could have eaten  here because they've got the allergens
dkQOZDILJOA,1835440,1843919,on the menu which is rare  so i know what's got dairy in so for  example  this homemade pinky with spicy garlic
dkQOZDILJOA,1843919,1850080,tomato sauce i could eat that bruschetta  obviously i could eat that  so i think we're gonna go for round two
dkQOZDILJOA,1850080,1856480,and i'm gonna order more pasta because  it is up and autumn at night so you  gotta enjoy it when you come hey
dkQOZDILJOA,1856480,1862960,thoughts  and kelly's also ordered another half  bottle of wine not that we need that the  bruschetta smells really strong of
dkQOZDILJOA,1862960,1871600,garlic which is  just  fine which is a bit me this wine is  actually also very good so this is
dkQOZDILJOA,1871600,1876960,kind of like a spaghetti and spicy  tomato sauce  parmesan and then kenny has got wild
dkQOZDILJOA,1876960,1882240,ball i think it was some kind of braggy  situation  so i really both were kenny but like
dkQOZDILJOA,1882240,1888880,i'll have a mouthful or two  [Laughter]  it's got hazelnut ice cream sensational
dkQOZDILJOA,1888880,1894640,obviously vegan you want some  and he's so drunk  um and now apparently
dkQOZDILJOA,1894640,1900159,you can't kiss the ice cream  honestly guys and um
dkQOZDILJOA,1900159,1905679,now we're going to another bar  apparently not that i want to i'm ready  for bed now but  kenny says i have no choice so we're
dkQOZDILJOA,1905679,1912880,going to another bar  honestly there's no one in the whole of
dkQOZDILJOA,1912880,1918880,florence more drunk than kenny right now  but this is really good we've made at  home we just walked all the way up
dkQOZDILJOA,1918880,1924960,the hill kenny and i are very full  they've done the turn down service and i
dkQOZDILJOA,1924960,1931519,don't know what this means but i just  think it's so cute they've put like our  slippers on these maps mine are also
dkQOZDILJOA,1931519,1937200,it's matte down here i don't know what  that means and then they put some  lavender in the bed
dkQOZDILJOA,1937200,1943840,so nice good morning  we've just come down for breakfast which
dkQOZDILJOA,1943840,1950180,we're having  outside on the terrace that i showed you  yesterday breakfast is through here
dkQOZDILJOA,1950180,1955440,[Music]  it's just like a big kind of buffet and  you help yourself it looks super good i
dkQOZDILJOA,1955440,1960640,think anything would look good in this  room though it's got sunday tomatoes  these are bolotti beans some grilled veg
dkQOZDILJOA,1960640,1965919,and some tomatoes obviously most of it  corny because most of it is cheese and  meat because
dkQOZDILJOA,1965919,1972960,we're in italy but they did have this  was called a vegan plum cake i have no  idea what that actually consists of but
dkQOZDILJOA,1972960,1979519,i'll try and let you know we've now come  back to this place to get kenny a coffee  if you want good coffee and you're in
dkQOZDILJOA,1979519,1985360,florence kenny said this is the best  he's had in italy so far  so also randomly there are some like
dkQOZDILJOA,1985360,1990559,vegan options in stockholm  if that is interesting to you i
dkQOZDILJOA,1990559,1996480,just bought some shoes and then it turns  out i had no idea but gucci was founded  in florence so that's pretty cool so
dkQOZDILJOA,1996480,2002159,we've just stopped for lunch and i've  got pretty much what kenny had at that  restaurant last night and then kenny has
dkQOZDILJOA,2002159,2008080,got  some kind of ragu situation the pasta  looks really good with chocolate
dkQOZDILJOA,2008080,2013279,with chocolate with cacao really oh no  and then we just got some spinach that's
dkQOZDILJOA,2013279,2019200,probably the better one  maybe oil
dkQOZDILJOA,2019200,2024320,this was the hotel guys from the front  we're just driving past you i think
dkQOZDILJOA,2024320,2030640,that's kind of all you're going to see  kenny said the next hotel's just outside  pisa because we fly home from pisa  tomorrow apparently we're 10 minutes
dkQOZDILJOA,2030640,2036880,away but it's looking very rural here i  thought our hotel was in pisa but turns  out kenny's booked like
dkQOZDILJOA,2036880,2044080,a bit more of a rural one  which is definitely above me  right in all the tuscan hills here
dkQOZDILJOA,2044080,2051358,big mountains  i feel like we're deep in the heart of  rural tuscany here what's up new york we
dkQOZDILJOA,2051358,2057839,went to that brandon beach oh yeah it  was it was palmer  so pretty if you guys saw our um
dkQOZDILJOA,2057839,2064960,ibiza palmer vlog from last summer it's  a very similar  kind of view and road to the one that we
dkQOZDILJOA,2064960,2071440,took  there when we went over to the beach on  one of those days  we're right by the hotel here 1.5
dkQOZDILJOA,2071440,2076669,kilometers this is the little town that  the hotel is in
dkQOZDILJOA,2076669,2080439,[Applause]
dkQOZDILJOA,2081679,2087200,it's beautiful so i think the market is  down here  and so we had to drive this long way
dkQOZDILJOA,2087200,2094079,around  but this is the front of the hotel just  walked out of the bar
dkQOZDILJOA,2094398,2100800,getting ready for the thermal pool  it's like a thermal ball in the spa here
dkQOZDILJOA,2100800,2105520,what they provided you  it's in the back
dkQOZDILJOA,2106160,2113119,you know  like we have these bags and they put  slippers and stuff and please show them  right try and put your foot
dkQOZDILJOA,2113119,2118640,i came out and put your foot in here and  kenny was saying
dkQOZDILJOA,2118790,2124240,[Music]  he was saying these are way too small  because he put on they put smaller ones
dkQOZDILJOA,2124240,2130480,for women  in the room as well  oh i can't go
dkQOZDILJOA,2130480,2137760,that is so funny  oh kenny  sometimes they have given us just some
dkQOZDILJOA,2137760,2143280,snacks as well which is a nice  touch and also i'm quite hungry so i  could do with them
dkQOZDILJOA,2143280,2148960,and now we're heading down to check out  the pool before it closes this is the  corridor which is kind of like the walk
dkQOZDILJOA,2148960,2154400,down  to our room  everything is on such a huge scale here
dkQOZDILJOA,2154400,2159680,she said it's like an old tuscan  who lived here kenny some tuscan
dkQOZDILJOA,2159680,2165920,important person  and then they also own all these gardens  behind and she said you can climb to the
dkQOZDILJOA,2165920,2171440,top of the gardens this is the walk down  to the spot you can see from how small  kenny is down there like the scale of
dkQOZDILJOA,2171440,2178560,this hotel  it is huge  we're now completely lost in the middle  of the hotel because it is that big oh
dkQOZDILJOA,2178560,2184240,we're at the front is this the right way  but where's the outside pool like where  can that possibly be
dkQOZDILJOA,2184240,2189280,this is one of five pools they have this  is like an indoor
dkQOZDILJOA,2189280,2194640,huh  [Applause]  what is it nice  also these caps as much as laughing at
dkQOZDILJOA,2194640,2200320,kenny for some reason you have to wear  them in here which i've never seen but  and then there's also a pull through
dkQOZDILJOA,2200320,2206640,that they've all got different things  this one's with like sea salt for some  reason i guess they must have like  health benefits
dkQOZDILJOA,2206640,2212240,um and then there's another one through  there and the spa has got two wings to  it
dkQOZDILJOA,2212240,2219119,so um  yeah i mean this hotel is outrageous and  then this is the rooftop pool
dkQOZDILJOA,2219119,2224800,which is actually super nice  it's kenny in this little green cap  don't know why you have to wear them
dkQOZDILJOA,2224800,2229839,everywhere but this is the  hotel over the back here
dkQOZDILJOA,2229839,2236320,i mean this hotel is this whole building  it's genuinely huge  you can see and then all the mountains
dkQOZDILJOA,2236320,2244000,and then the hotel goes all  the  way around and there's the bit where we
dkQOZDILJOA,2244000,2250320,parked our car it's just absolutely huge  like vast  okay so i'm gonna give you a room tour
dkQOZDILJOA,2250320,2256320,i've already messed the room up a bit so  let's just ignore that but the first  room you come into these clothes to spit
dkQOZDILJOA,2256320,2263119,dog is kind of like a living room area  this is genuinely the biggest hotel room  i've ever seen in my entire life and
dkQOZDILJOA,2263119,2269680,probably is the biggest one i will see i  don't know if you get the scale like  especially of how high the ceilings are
dkQOZDILJOA,2269680,2274800,and then you come through here i've just  got storage space and stuff and the  bathroom's in here kenny just had a
dkQOZDILJOA,2274800,2281599,shower so  messed up but then in here  this is the bedroom and um again excuse
dkQOZDILJOA,2281599,2287280,the bed but it is  enormous like absolutely
dkQOZDILJOA,2287280,2292960,vast so these are all the wardrobes over  here go and stand in the other corner  because otherwise i don't think
dkQOZDILJOA,2292960,2299440,you can tell the scale  hopefully by seeing the size of kenny on
dkQOZDILJOA,2299440,2305680,the camera you can understand like the  scale of this room that's kenny and then  look how much further up the ceiling
dkQOZDILJOA,2305680,2311440,goes  yeah it's very  what do you call it like rustic kind of
dkQOZDILJOA,2311440,2318560,thing and then i'll just show you  there's not much to see out of the  window i don't think it's worth staying  here just to experience a um room of
dkQOZDILJOA,2318560,2323839,this  scale if we just come to the hotel bar  to have a drink before we leave and
dkQOZDILJOA,2323839,2328880,we've got some of the snacks they give  you and then to be honest can't see much  because
dkQOZDILJOA,2328880,2336000,this old rules here  but kenny's playing spotting on his app  another hobby of kenny's i got gin and
dkQOZDILJOA,2336000,2342800,tonic and kenny got  something i just don't know what is it  gin ricky we're just um driving into
dkQOZDILJOA,2342800,2349200,pisa now and it's surrounded by this big  city wall which i did not know and kenny  thinks that he's seen the leaning tower
dkQOZDILJOA,2349200,2355440,of pisa over there about four times and  has been stuck on her phone  kenny that's not the case first of all
dkQOZDILJOA,2355440,2361839,he told me to look up because he said  there's the tower and it was a telephone  um  like what they called
dkQOZDILJOA,2361839,2368480,he tells me look up it's a telephone  tower can you then blame me when i don't  look up the next few times you look very
dkQOZDILJOA,2368480,2374560,handsome tonight honey if i do you say  literally it's just buying with more  well okay if i unless i'm missing
dkQOZDILJOA,2374560,2379599,something everyone can you see it  i also think we'll probably get a better
dkQOZDILJOA,2379599,2386800,view inside  oh let me guess that's it  no no  no really we found her everybody i mean
dkQOZDILJOA,2386800,2391839,it looks just like the history book so i  learned about it at school  it's a lot i'm smaller than i thought
dkQOZDILJOA,2391839,2397040,yeah it's a fun fact then i don't have a  i really don't have a fun part for you  is that not a lot smaller than you would
dkQOZDILJOA,2397040,2403359,have thought though  i thought it would be really tall for  some reason here it is in all its glory  kenny just requested to get there but
dkQOZDILJOA,2403359,2409280,now you need one of those like french  hats  why what does that do well in
dkQOZDILJOA,2409280,2414640,but like it's like a  thumbnail do you want to show them the  the pose you told me you're going to do
dkQOZDILJOA,2414640,2418480,go on what pose you're going to do next  to it
dkQOZDILJOA,2423900,2429760,[Applause]  [Music]  walking home but there's some kind of
dkQOZDILJOA,2429760,2435040,like championship or whether everyone's  just randomly playing it i think it's  like a game
dkQOZDILJOA,2435040,2441359,oh it's a game spa  kenny's jealous we all know how much he  loves the bald game oh it is like a  competition
dkQOZDILJOA,2441359,2446400,no i've never seen the game before  you'd win though wouldn't you never seen  it you live before but i'm sure you
dkQOZDILJOA,2446400,2451079,could do it crack it want to figure out  the rules
dkQOZDILJOA,2470400,2472480,you
