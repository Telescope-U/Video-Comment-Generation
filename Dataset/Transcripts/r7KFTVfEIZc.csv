r7KFTVfEIZc,23439,26320,some fun activities planned for us today
r7KFTVfEIZc,26320,29119,different art things different crafty
r7KFTVfEIZc,29119,31279,kind of things i try to choose things
r7KFTVfEIZc,31279,34239,that are fun that are easy and have a
r7KFTVfEIZc,34239,37120,lot of creative freedom
r7KFTVfEIZc,37120,39200,i know why i feel like something's
r7KFTVfEIZc,39200,41440,missing something's missing i didn't
r7KFTVfEIZc,41440,44640,prepare my clipboard here it is got my
r7KFTVfEIZc,44640,47680,clipboard oh just write down the things
r7KFTVfEIZc,47680,50320,that i'm doing today
r7KFTVfEIZc,50320,52160,good you can all breathe a sigh of
r7KFTVfEIZc,52160,54239,relief and everyone can calm down the
r7KFTVfEIZc,54239,56320,clipboard is here let's just jump right
r7KFTVfEIZc,56320,59920,into the first activity make cupcakes
r7KFTVfEIZc,59920,63120,out of clay i love cupcakes this is a
r7KFTVfEIZc,63120,65198,thing you may know i like making real
r7KFTVfEIZc,65198,67760,cupcakes i like drawing cupcakes i like
r7KFTVfEIZc,67760,69760,painting cupcakes i wanted a way to make
r7KFTVfEIZc,69760,72320,a real cupcake but one that i can keep
r7KFTVfEIZc,72320,74720,forever because i like to hoard things
r7KFTVfEIZc,74720,76400,i'm just kidding hoarding is not a good
r7KFTVfEIZc,76400,78240,thing no no no okay maybe i should
r7KFTVfEIZc,78240,79920,change the wording to collecting because
r7KFTVfEIZc,79920,82799,that's less problematic i'm a collector
r7KFTVfEIZc,82799,85200,what the heck what was i talking about
r7KFTVfEIZc,85200,87200,oh yeah and so then i proceeded to
r7KFTVfEIZc,87200,89520,experiment different ways to make a clay
r7KFTVfEIZc,89520,91520,cupcake that's like really streamlined
r7KFTVfEIZc,91520,94400,and easy and it's like wait wait i have
r7KFTVfEIZc,94400,96159,all of this air dry clay and these
r7KFTVfEIZc,96159,97840,little cute baggies that i've had
r7KFTVfEIZc,97840,100880,sitting in my art room for simply years
r7KFTVfEIZc,100880,103680,okay so i grab it now about two three
r7KFTVfEIZc,103680,106640,years later and
r7KFTVfEIZc,107360,109119,it's not exactly
r7KFTVfEIZc,109119,111920,workable all that clay has dried out
r7KFTVfEIZc,111920,114720,this is the not glamorous side of
r7KFTVfEIZc,114720,116719,hoarding you hoard something and you
r7KFTVfEIZc,116719,120000,realize it's been in the horde so long
r7KFTVfEIZc,120000,123040,it's died there look at this now i have
r7KFTVfEIZc,123040,125280,all this play
r7KFTVfEIZc,125280,127360,let's just kind of move on to the point
r7KFTVfEIZc,127360,129360,i came to the sad realization that all
r7KFTVfEIZc,129360,132879,my clay is dead i mourned and i um moved
r7KFTVfEIZc,132879,136879,on i tried various other
r7KFTVfEIZc,137680,139840,we won't talk about that one finally i
r7KFTVfEIZc,139840,142879,came up with my patented technique it's
r7KFTVfEIZc,142879,144560,not actually patented you can't just say
r7KFTVfEIZc,144560,147440,something's patented i made this is it
r7KFTVfEIZc,147440,149840,not the most painfully ugly thing that
r7KFTVfEIZc,149840,151680,you've ever seen yes it is i was using
r7KFTVfEIZc,151680,153280,colors that i didn't think that i was
r7KFTVfEIZc,153280,155680,gonna use just to test out my method so
r7KFTVfEIZc,155680,157920,i got some new clay
r7KFTVfEIZc,157920,160640,why did i get so much clay and you know
r7KFTVfEIZc,160640,162000,what i just can't do it i have to come
r7KFTVfEIZc,162000,162959,clean
r7KFTVfEIZc,162959,166400,there's more there's more
r7KFTVfEIZc,167440,169360,okay ladies and gentlemen this is the
r7KFTVfEIZc,169360,171519,thing about hoarder behavior when you
r7KFTVfEIZc,171519,174480,lose something you attempt to not only
r7KFTVfEIZc,174480,178000,replace it but over compensate for the
r7KFTVfEIZc,178000,180080,thing that you lost i think that's what
r7KFTVfEIZc,180080,182800,we're seeing here okay so what you will
r7KFTVfEIZc,182800,186879,need is um clay a cupcake tin
r7KFTVfEIZc,186879,190400,cupcake liners i'm using a piping tip
r7KFTVfEIZc,190400,193280,and a piping bag optional is paint if
r7KFTVfEIZc,193280,195599,you want to add some little decorations
r7KFTVfEIZc,195599,197760,then some little plastic charms i have
r7KFTVfEIZc,197760,200159,all these charms today is the day for
r7KFTVfEIZc,200159,202239,these to shine first i'm gonna get kind
r7KFTVfEIZc,202239,205200,of the boring part over with because i
r7KFTVfEIZc,205200,206159,being
r7KFTVfEIZc,206159,209599,my extra self got white cupcake liners
r7KFTVfEIZc,209599,211599,so that i could paint them in the the
r7KFTVfEIZc,211599,213599,colors that i wanted so we have to paint
r7KFTVfEIZc,213599,214959,them
r7KFTVfEIZc,214959,218400,ignore the brown smudge let's start with
r7KFTVfEIZc,218400,222239,this nice lilac and i'm just gonna paint
r7KFTVfEIZc,222239,226599,the freaking cupcake liner
r7KFTVfEIZc,227090,237060,[Music]
r7KFTVfEIZc,238560,240720,all right so i've taken the unnecessary
r7KFTVfEIZc,240720,243120,extra step of painting some little
r7KFTVfEIZc,243120,244879,cupcake liners so now we are ready i'm
r7KFTVfEIZc,244879,248239,gonna start with the purple one
r7KFTVfEIZc,252959,255680,wow let's cook up a nice chocolate
r7KFTVfEIZc,255680,258238,cupcake
r7KFTVfEIZc,259519,262240,nice poo poo clay so this is what you
r7KFTVfEIZc,262240,263520,want to see
r7KFTVfEIZc,263520,265199,i'm going to need more clay than this
r7KFTVfEIZc,265199,268400,for a cupcake so i'm going to mix this
r7KFTVfEIZc,268400,270240,weird
r7KFTVfEIZc,270240,274639,fleshy color oh it's wet on top oh gosh
r7KFTVfEIZc,274639,275520,oh
r7KFTVfEIZc,275520,278240,gross mix those up i think this should
r7KFTVfEIZc,278240,281120,be enough so you need this amount it's
r7KFTVfEIZc,281120,284320,like the size of a baseball i think i
r7KFTVfEIZc,284320,285520,don't know it's been a long time since
r7KFTVfEIZc,285520,287120,i've held a baseball now that we have
r7KFTVfEIZc,287120,289360,our batter made
r7KFTVfEIZc,289360,291440,i'm gonna just take little pieces and
r7KFTVfEIZc,291440,294639,kind of cram the clay into the cupcake
r7KFTVfEIZc,294639,297360,tin and then just create a nice rounded
r7KFTVfEIZc,297360,300000,top once we get that in there kind of
r7KFTVfEIZc,300000,302720,wiggle it out get this out of the way
r7KFTVfEIZc,302720,305840,oh wait i hate this color now it looks
r7KFTVfEIZc,305840,308160,like a gray turd
r7KFTVfEIZc,308160,310720,i don't like this i'm thinking these can
r7KFTVfEIZc,310720,312880,counter each other see if this helps
r7KFTVfEIZc,312880,314880,that looks a little more like chocolate
r7KFTVfEIZc,314880,317039,batter that i'd want to eat so let's do
r7KFTVfEIZc,317039,318960,this again it doesn't really matter what
r7KFTVfEIZc,318960,321120,clay you put in the bottom stick the
r7KFTVfEIZc,321120,324400,nice stuff on top
r7KFTVfEIZc,324400,327039,take our painted cupcake liner and you
r7KFTVfEIZc,327039,329199,can just kind of push the liner into the
r7KFTVfEIZc,329199,332000,clay there oh my gosh it's already cute
r7KFTVfEIZc,332000,334240,what is this turd
r7KFTVfEIZc,334240,338479,i think i'm gonna go with white frosting
r7KFTVfEIZc,338479,341039,i'm gonna take my piping bag load up the
r7KFTVfEIZc,341039,343039,clay now
r7KFTVfEIZc,343039,345520,we are ready to pipe clay i wish this
r7KFTVfEIZc,345520,348080,worked as well in real life as it did in
r7KFTVfEIZc,348080,350800,my fantasy mind because it's not the
r7KFTVfEIZc,350800,352800,easiest thing ever let me give you a
r7KFTVfEIZc,352800,355039,quick alternative if you don't have this
r7KFTVfEIZc,355039,357520,all you have to do is take a nice little
r7KFTVfEIZc,357520,359840,friendly turd like this roll it into a
r7KFTVfEIZc,359840,362479,tapered snake that looks so gross and
r7KFTVfEIZc,362479,365440,then you just kind of roll it around and
r7KFTVfEIZc,365440,366960,you can kind of get like a little
r7KFTVfEIZc,366960,369520,frosting look back into a turn but i'm
r7KFTVfEIZc,369520,372720,gonna try to go for a more fancy look
r7KFTVfEIZc,372720,374400,i'm gonna need a stand for this really
r7KFTVfEIZc,374400,377280,got to get in here push the clay through
r7KFTVfEIZc,377280,380000,the piping tip i found that it works
r7KFTVfEIZc,380000,383039,better to just pipe a line and then just
r7KFTVfEIZc,383039,386160,by hand put the frosting on success
r7KFTVfEIZc,386160,388880,finally the decorations there's so many
r7KFTVfEIZc,388880,392080,cute ones i like this thing i'm gonna
r7KFTVfEIZc,392080,394639,add this to the top of my cupcake i'm
r7KFTVfEIZc,394639,397039,going to add some little sprinkles and
r7KFTVfEIZc,397039,399600,i'm going to use my tweezers to do this
r7KFTVfEIZc,399600,401520,so that i don't get my fingers in the
r7KFTVfEIZc,401520,403280,clay you got to really push them in
r7KFTVfEIZc,403280,405039,there so they stick in the clay and
r7KFTVfEIZc,405039,407199,don't fall out and i have my beautiful
r7KFTVfEIZc,407199,409440,wonderful little cupcake finish i think
r7KFTVfEIZc,409440,412560,it came out really adorable i do have
r7KFTVfEIZc,412560,414880,two other painted cupcake liners so i'm
r7KFTVfEIZc,414880,416560,gonna quickly whip up another two and
r7KFTVfEIZc,416560,419420,then i'll show you what i've done
r7KFTVfEIZc,419420,440679,[Music]
r7KFTVfEIZc,446720,449720,right
r7KFTVfEIZc,458400,460319,all right and
r7KFTVfEIZc,460319,464080,here are my little cupcakes this took me
r7KFTVfEIZc,464080,467039,a lot longer than i was anticipating
r7KFTVfEIZc,467039,468720,we gotta get rolling we gotta rock and
r7KFTVfEIZc,468720,469840,roll for the rest of these things
r7KFTVfEIZc,469840,472960,because whoa this took forever honestly
r7KFTVfEIZc,472960,474800,i'm kind of obsessed with them not gonna
r7KFTVfEIZc,474800,476720,lie so of course these are just little
r7KFTVfEIZc,476720,478800,decor items that are just for fun you

r7KFTVfEIZc,521839,524080,pre-order but i do want to let you know
r7KFTVfEIZc,524080,527040,that there is only one week left every
r7KFTVfEIZc,527040,529040,time i do a pre-order there's always so
r7KFTVfEIZc,529040,531680,many people who wait until the end and
r7KFTVfEIZc,531680,534080,then forget and miss the date and then
r7KFTVfEIZc,534080,536000,they like freak out a couple days after

r7KFTVfEIZc,545040,548240,beautiful lovely massive shell you knew
r7KFTVfEIZc,548240,550000,says plushes please be sure to place
r7KFTVfEIZc,550000,551600,your order thank you so much for
r7KFTVfEIZc,551600,553120,listening to my little announcement and
r7KFTVfEIZc,553120,555440,let's get back to the video so i have
r7KFTVfEIZc,555440,557279,not
r7KFTVfEIZc,557279,559200,tested this i'm really not sure if it's
r7KFTVfEIZc,559200,560800,gonna work we're gonna find out together
r7KFTVfEIZc,560800,563040,here's what we do you take some paint
r7KFTVfEIZc,563040,565120,cheap paint i think it's actually gonna
r7KFTVfEIZc,565120,566800,work better than the nicer paints
r7KFTVfEIZc,566800,569680,because it's nice and liquidy a canvas
r7KFTVfEIZc,569680,571920,board you don't actually need a canvas
r7KFTVfEIZc,571920,574000,board you just need a surface and then
r7KFTVfEIZc,574000,577600,you need your thing and i'm thinking i
r7KFTVfEIZc,577600,580320,can use these beads the concept is you
r7KFTVfEIZc,580320,582800,put paint down and then you roll things
r7KFTVfEIZc,582800,584800,through it and it's this kind of
r7KFTVfEIZc,584800,587200,abstract effect i think it's something
r7KFTVfEIZc,587200,589360,that i've vaguely seen and it's in my
r7KFTVfEIZc,589360,592000,memory somewhere but i could be leaving
r7KFTVfEIZc,592000,593680,a very critical detail out i'm not
r7KFTVfEIZc,593680,595440,really sure i think most of the time
r7KFTVfEIZc,595440,597839,people use larger objects but they're
r7KFTVfEIZc,597839,600959,spherical you roll it why not use beads
r7KFTVfEIZc,600959,605240,now these are naked wood
r7KFTVfEIZc,605920,607200,so i
r7KFTVfEIZc,607200,610200,have actually gone ahead and
r7KFTVfEIZc,610200,613200,pre-gessoed some beads that way we don't
r7KFTVfEIZc,613200,614640,have to sit here and watch me just
r7KFTVfEIZc,614640,617600,sewing beads i've come prepared let's
r7KFTVfEIZc,617600,619920,not stall any longer i'm rolling up my
r7KFTVfEIZc,619920,623120,sleeves this is getting serious
r7KFTVfEIZc,623120,625519,all right so taking some paint i'm just
r7KFTVfEIZc,625519,628480,gonna kind of do some things i'm gonna
r7KFTVfEIZc,628480,630320,use all the colors i think that could be
r7KFTVfEIZc,630320,632959,a recipe for disaster and probably will
r7KFTVfEIZc,632959,634880,i'm still going to go for it and just
r7KFTVfEIZc,634880,637600,hope for the best
r7KFTVfEIZc,638160,640000,this is not going to look good i just i
r7KFTVfEIZc,640000,641519,already know it now i have some
r7KFTVfEIZc,641519,644000,toothpicks toothpicks toothpicks which i
r7KFTVfEIZc,644000,645920,thought might come in handy but i don't
r7KFTVfEIZc,645920,647279,know because i haven't tried this yet
r7KFTVfEIZc,647279,648959,and i'm going to just put this through
r7KFTVfEIZc,648959,651279,one of the beads wow
r7KFTVfEIZc,651279,655279,wow wow wow wow touch down and roll with
r7KFTVfEIZc,655279,656560,the toothpick on there you're only going
r7KFTVfEIZc,656560,659040,to get like a band of color maybe we
r7KFTVfEIZc,659040,660800,need to get messy maybe we need to stop
r7KFTVfEIZc,660800,664720,living in fear and just roll the thing
r7KFTVfEIZc,664720,666399,okay it didn't really go anywhere just
r7KFTVfEIZc,666399,670720,manually roll this around huh um so
r7KFTVfEIZc,670720,675360,there's a ton of excess paint on there
r7KFTVfEIZc,675360,678000,take a paper towel and go for a little
r7KFTVfEIZc,678000,680720,spin actually kind of worked okay how am
r7KFTVfEIZc,680720,682720,i gonna dry all of these at the same
r7KFTVfEIZc,682720,684079,time
r7KFTVfEIZc,684079,686320,ladies and gentlemen this is a brain at
r7KFTVfEIZc,686320,689200,work problem solving we have a block of
r7KFTVfEIZc,689200,691680,styrofoam insert the toothpick stand it
r7KFTVfEIZc,691680,695360,up like so but a bam bead drying station
r7KFTVfEIZc,695360,697120,all right so i kind of have a process
r7KFTVfEIZc,697120,700000,going on here toss the bead in the paint
r7KFTVfEIZc,700000,702079,roll it around there then grab a
r7KFTVfEIZc,702079,704480,toothpick take a clean paper towel or
r7KFTVfEIZc,704480,707680,clean ish and roll off the excess paint
r7KFTVfEIZc,707680,711040,then it's ready to stick on my ingenious
r7KFTVfEIZc,711040,712800,invention and you know what the colors
r7KFTVfEIZc,712800,715040,are getting really muddy
r7KFTVfEIZc,715040,718160,new canvas board let's turn a new leaf i
r7KFTVfEIZc,718160,720079,don't really want orange i don't really
r7KFTVfEIZc,720079,722480,want green what if we do like these four
r7KFTVfEIZc,722480,724800,plus white i don't even know if this is
r7KFTVfEIZc,724800,727200,like the best way to lay out the paint
r7KFTVfEIZc,727200,729760,i'm probably doing this extremely wrong
r7KFTVfEIZc,729760,731279,this could still get really muddy i
r7KFTVfEIZc,731279,733200,think i am happier with the look of that
r7KFTVfEIZc,733200,737720,though so let me finish these up
r7KFTVfEIZc,740460,752240,[Music]
r7KFTVfEIZc,752240,755360,alrighty so once the beads did dry i
r7KFTVfEIZc,755360,758000,went ahead and glazed them and now these
r7KFTVfEIZc,758000,760800,look as if they are ready to go i didn't
r7KFTVfEIZc,760800,762560,actually do anything with the five
r7KFTVfEIZc,762560,764800,rainbow ones that i made because i think
r7KFTVfEIZc,764800,767320,that they're kind of ugly so but
r7KFTVfEIZc,767320,770320,these came out pretty good i feel like
r7KFTVfEIZc,770320,773519,loose beads is not a complete project so
r7KFTVfEIZc,773519,775040,i'm just going to throw these on a
r7KFTVfEIZc,775040,777070,little keychain okay real quick
r7KFTVfEIZc,777070,780399,[Music]
r7KFTVfEIZc,780399,782160,all right i'm just going to put those
r7KFTVfEIZc,782160,783920,five on the keychain because i feel like
r7KFTVfEIZc,783920,785680,more than that is just too much um so i
r7KFTVfEIZc,785680,788079,still have five left this turned out way
r7KFTVfEIZc,788079,790160,better than i was expecting to be honest
r7KFTVfEIZc,790160,792480,especially after that first roll through
r7KFTVfEIZc,792480,795839,the paint but actually i quite like this
r7KFTVfEIZc,795839,797920,i think it's really cute
r7KFTVfEIZc,797920,800320,back to the clipboard next thing is
r7KFTVfEIZc,800320,804720,create diy tassel keychains if you've
r7KFTVfEIZc,804720,807920,never made tassels before it's very very
r7KFTVfEIZc,807920,811680,very easy i have a small horde here of
r7KFTVfEIZc,811680,815120,embroidery thread
r7KFTVfEIZc,815120,816160,is that what this is called i think
r7KFTVfEIZc,816160,817440,that's what this is called you can
r7KFTVfEIZc,817440,819839,either use something like this or you
r7KFTVfEIZc,819839,822720,can use yarn am i gonna spend the time
r7KFTVfEIZc,822720,825040,to go pick up my yarn so i can show it
r7KFTVfEIZc,825040,826240,oh
r7KFTVfEIZc,826240,828720,this is how much i love you
r7KFTVfEIZc,828720,830959,got it you can also use yarn the
r7KFTVfEIZc,830959,832720,difference is obviously going to be
r7KFTVfEIZc,832720,834480,you're going to get a thinner smaller
r7KFTVfEIZc,834480,837600,tassel versus a big fat thick tassel i'm
r7KFTVfEIZc,837600,839920,going to go for a smaller tassel a
r7KFTVfEIZc,839920,841839,little bit more delicate a little bit
r7KFTVfEIZc,841839,844800,daintier this is super easy we need our
r7KFTVfEIZc,844800,847360,weapon we need to choose a color let me
