L8UT0iVne24,261100,268210,what your mindset is like in terms of today and your future. Are you going to
L8UT0iVne24,268210,273750,make today count? Because that's all you can control and that's all that matters.
L8UT0iVne24,273750,277840,It doesn't matter where you start guys it doesn't matter what talents you're
L8UT0iVne24,277840,283330,born with. It's about where you finish and this race isn't over. It's not over.
L8UT0iVne24,283330,288610,You can still come in first in the marathon but you got to start today. You
L8UT0iVne24,288610,295740,"got to start now. You have everything, you have everything you need is inside you."
L8UT0iVne24,295740,301388,It doesn't matter what you don't have now because you can go get it but it
L8UT0iVne24,301389,306880,"starts today. It starts with a commitment it starts with the principle, it starts with"

L8UT0iVne24,311320,316720,idea that you're gonna make today count and a lot of people want to know what my
L8UT0iVne24,316720,321310,"routine is like. Well, it's predicated on that idea - that I'm going to make today"
L8UT0iVne24,321310,327699,"count and that means that before everyone is up, I'm going to have entered"
L8UT0iVne24,327699,330810,a peak state already.
L8UT0iVne24,331100,338120,I'm here to help you but you have to help yourself. No one's going to do it
L8UT0iVne24,338120,344150,"for you in terms of the action but you got to say something with me. ""I'm going"
L8UT0iVne24,344150,349370,to make this thing work. I'm going to live out my dreams. I'm going to live out
L8UT0iVne24,349370,355460,"my purpose, I'm going to be who I was destined to be, I'm going to fulfill all"
L8UT0iVne24,355460,363020,"of the tasks necessary to live out that purpose, to become who I really want to"
L8UT0iVne24,363020,373900,"be. Not be who I am shackled by in the past, not live in a world of constraint."""
L8UT0iVne24,373900,379110,I didn’t come this far to only come this far. I hear some people saying things like:
L8UT0iVne24,379110,385530,"“When I make it”, “When I get to the top”… “I’ll keep working hard until i get to"
L8UT0iVne24,385530,392040,"the top”, “until I reach my goal"". Let me tell you something: There is no “END”!"
L8UT0iVne24,392040,399419,WINNERS NEVER STOP. If you reach your GOAL: SET A BIGGER GOAL.
L8UT0iVne24,399419,402229,If you get to the top of the mountain: Find a bigger mountain!
L8UT0iVne24,402229,408870,It’s the journey. The continued pursuit of growth. The constant seeking of improvement.
L8UT0iVne24,408870,413310,THE CHALLENGE. That’s what makes life great.
L8UT0iVne24,413310,419580,That’s what makes a fulfilled life. I didn’t come this far to only come this far!
L8UT0iVne24,419580,427620,When I get this GOAL: I’ll seek MORE. Not more things. MORE GROWTH.
L8UT0iVne24,427620,434870,Constantly pushing myself to be better. I didn’t come this far to only come this far!
L8UT0iVne24,434870,444060,I came this far so I could be strong enough to go further! So I would be good enough to push myself harder!
L8UT0iVne24,444060,449370,I’m only getting started. This is just the beginning.
L8UT0iVne24,449370,454979,"I AM proud of my achievements, but that doesn’t mean I’ll settle for them."
L8UT0iVne24,454980,462260,PROUD but NEVER SATISFIED. PROUD but FOREVER HUNGRY. PROUD and ALWAYS READY.
L8UT0iVne24,462260,468580,PROUD but PUSHING. PUSHING FOR MORE. PUSHING FOR GREAT.
L8UT0iVne24,468580,475210,A true winner doesn’t seek only the title. A true winner seeks GROWTH.
L8UT0iVne24,475210,484120,A true winner seeks GREATNESS. It’s the JOURNEY. It’s the CHALLENGE. Don’t tell me it’s over.
L8UT0iVne24,484120,486960,I’M JUST GETTING WARMED UP!
L8UT0iVne24,486960,493470,"If the journey wasn’t challenging, the destination wouldn’t be rewarding."
L8UT0iVne24,493470,498780,t’s the challenge that makes the greatness. You can’t have a champion athlete without
L8UT0iVne24,498780,503280,great competitors pushing them all the way. You can’t have the greatest of all
L8UT0iVne24,503280,509430,"time without champions pushing them all the way. It’s the journey. The process, that makes the greatness."
L8UT0iVne24,509430,515880,If you reach your GOAL: SET A BIGGER GOAL. If you get to the top of the mountain:
L8UT0iVne24,515880,520810,Find a bigger mountain!
L8UT0iVne24,529440,535300,"Winners, the difference between them and the spectators is the winners have a"
L8UT0iVne24,535300,541510,belief that overrides the crowds disbelief every single time. Their belief
L8UT0iVne24,541510,545290,"is so strong, even though they hit failure they get knocked on their ass"
L8UT0iVne24,545290,548560,"find the intentional force me to stand back up again, face that same challenge, learning from"
L8UT0iVne24,548560,552459,the previous mistakes and make it happen.

L8UT0iVne24,574410,580420,if you're ready to transform. You must believe in yourself enough to

L8UT0iVne24,592780,597370,"but they haven't done the back research preparing it, to make sure their effort"
L8UT0iVne24,597370,601029,is of accordance of where they want to go in life so they end up just doing random
L8UT0iVne24,601030,603880,"they put, they're dumb and random then because they don't even know what they're really"
L8UT0iVne24,603880,607630,"doing because they haven't studied it, they haven't prepared for it and when you fail to"

L8UT0iVne24,650800,656118,"everything you have. Come in here ready, mentally ready, headstrong because that's how you"
L8UT0iVne24,656360,660470,"have to be mentally tough up here. If you guys mentally believe you can do it, your body"
L8UT0iVne24,660470,664639,"will find a way physically to make it happen. If you're short up here, it doesn't matter"
L8UT0iVne24,664640,668089,"what you do with these guys, it will never materialize into anything, no"
L8UT0iVne24,668089,673700,dream will ever become reality. This is just a rant. Very simple. And something that I want you
L8UT0iVne24,673700,678410,to pass on or watch every Monday morning because the level of complaining is unacceptable.
L8UT0iVne24,678410,683329,"Look, what if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? What if I told you you’d"
L8UT0iVne24,683329,686990,die this week? Would you complain about your crap job? I doubt it. You’d go much higher level thinking.
L8UT0iVne24,686990,690860,We are living in a world where there is so much more opportunity; I just don't get
L8UT0iVne24,690860,696019,the mentality of being head down sad. Please take a step back and think about
L8UT0iVne24,696019,700760,how awesome it actually is and then recognize that you can attack the world
L8UT0iVne24,700760,707230,in a totally different way cause you were lucky enough to be born during this era.
L8UT0iVne24,707230,715940,"400 trillion to one. When you understand that math, how can't you live your life. That's how rare it is to be a human"

L8UT0iVne24,723019,730910,our ambitions and what it leads to is a whole lot of complaining. Of course it's
L8UT0iVne24,730910,734810,supposed to be hard. People are like Gary it's so hard no shit you want to make
L8UT0iVne24,734810,740000,"millions of dollars and live your perfect life, why should that be easy? You"
L8UT0iVne24,740000,745430,"can live on six hours sleep so you have 18 hours, you have 18 goddamn hours, I want"
L8UT0iVne24,745430,748850,to know what you're doing with your 18 hours cause you can work your 9:00 to 5:00
L8UT0iVne24,748850,752959,"and that's nine and you can travel for an hour here and there, respect nice"
L8UT0iVne24,752959,755089,"little solid commute, oh you want to be a family man"
L8UT0iVne24,755089,758690,Mazel Tov. You can spend two hours with your kids. What are you doing with those

L8UT0iVne24,761899,766368,"playing Madden, you're relaxing from the other intense ten, Gary I already spent"
L8UT0iVne24,766369,772279,11 hours. Well great. Then don't complain or want more. Respect that by getting
L8UT0iVne24,772279,776929,"rest and this and that, you were giving up opportunity to go into a new work- you"
L8UT0iVne24,776929,783139,want the audacity to have a 1% life.  Let's call it what it is. You want to live
L8UT0iVne24,783139,787938,as well as the 1 to 2% in the world it's not very complicated the math is very raw
L8UT0iVne24,787939,791959,like you if you want to have one of the best lives in the world which
L8UT0iVne24,791959,797959,"is, you live on your terms, you have to pay your dues to get there. Let me"
L8UT0iVne24,797959,802069,promise you something I know tens of thousands of people and I know thousands of
L8UT0iVne24,802069,806058,"people extremely well, I know hundreds of people deeply well. There is no"
L8UT0iVne24,806059,810199,correlation between how much money someone makes and their level of
L8UT0iVne24,810199,814790,happiness but what's not being talked about is the friends and acquaintances I
L8UT0iVne24,814790,818378,have who have committed suicide in the entrepreneurial land in the last four years
L8UT0iVne24,818379,823449,because nobody talks about the downside. Everybody thinks they're gonna be Zucks
L8UT0iVne24,823449,828959,everybody thinks they're gonna build Snapchat. Go look at the data
L8UT0iVne24,828960,833130,"the data shows that the bar majority of this room will not succeed, not even"
L8UT0iVne24,833130,838380,close to building an actual business and I don't come here to be somber. I come
L8UT0iVne24,838380,844110,here to remind you that there's only one thing you can do. The only thing you can
L8UT0iVne24,844110,851070,"do that can trump the moment mommy and daddy had sex to make you, the only thing"
L8UT0iVne24,851070,855060,"that can trump that, the only thing that can trump your DNA, the only thing that"
L8UT0iVne24,855060,861779,"is controllable, if you want it, if you want this, it's work. Who's in it cuz"
L8UT0iVne24,861779,866339,they're in it and who's in it cuz it's the trend and let's not get it twisted
L8UT0iVne24,866339,872310,it's easy you can say you're a rapper or an athlete but you can easily see that
L8UT0iVne24,872310,878040,you're not. Entrepreneurship is hidden entrepreneurship is kind of like you say
L8UT0iVne24,878040,882810,"it on your gram account and then you kind of can look the part, you can go to"
L8UT0iVne24,882810,887730,"the parties, you can go to the conference's like you can trick it way"
L8UT0iVne24,887730,893040,more right then a lot of other things and- and so I'm saying this very
L8UT0iVne24,893040,897480,carefully listen to me if you know deep down that you're being exposed by this
L8UT0iVne24,897480,903089,rant here's a smart move before the world collapses go figure out who you
L8UT0iVne24,903089,908760,"think is actually gonna survive that, who are the wartime generals. Let me remind a"
L8UT0iVne24,908760,913620,lot of you the 84th employee at Facebook is gonna make much more money than the
L8UT0iVne24,913620,916680,founder of almost every company that's gonna be invented over the next five
L8UT0iVne24,916680,921779,decades so the one advantage is the access to these winners that you've
L8UT0iVne24,921779,925950,never seen before so if you are listening right now and said Gary like I
L8UT0iVne24,925950,929760,"got this, I'm gonna do it, then do it. Stick it to my face. I can't wait to get"
L8UT0iVne24,929760,932980,"the email from you five, six, seven, eight years from now. But if"
L8UT0iVne24,932980,938079,you're listening and saying it's true cuz I wasn't into being a businessman or

L8UT0iVne24,947470,953769,a real thought to this because we've seen this in 2001 and 2008 shit is very
L8UT0iVne24,953770,957910,"ugly and it's a ten year, seven year, five year"
L8UT0iVne24,957910,962440,step back or you could take advantage of the window we're in right now and take
L8UT0iVne24,962440,967060,advantage of the fruitful times and the access to these A plus generals and I
L8UT0iVne24,967060,971770,would jump on those boats if I were you and if you're fortunate enough to be
L8UT0iVne24,971770,977170,"here today, to know to be here today, to afford to be here today"
L8UT0iVne24,977170,981820,you are sitting in an incredible spot of the seven point seven billion
L8UT0iVne24,981820,986140,people on earth and I just don't understand why you wouldn't take full

L8UT0iVne24,990400,995530,"start understanding how this is all working, deeper not wider. You don't need"
L8UT0iVne24,995530,1001230,"to know in theory how AI and Alexa voice and VR and social media work, you"
L8UT0iVne24,1001230,1005399,need to start understanding how one of those things works deeply. I've gotten
L8UT0iVne24,1005400,1010860,here today because I didn't come to conferences and talk or make videos or
L8UT0iVne24,1010860,1016290,build a personal brand for the first 15 years of my career. Let me remind many of
L8UT0iVne24,1016290,1021000,"you long before I was 'Gary Vee,' I was Gary Vaynerchuk building a liquor store"
L8UT0iVne24,1021000,1026220,"by being good at email marketing, at Google AdWords, at banner retargeting, at"

L8UT0iVne24,1036089,1040709,little audacity to come and talk to you about how I did it. The amount of 23 year
L8UT0iVne24,1040709,1044850,old business coaches and marketing gurus who haven't done it in their life that's
L8UT0iVne24,1044850,1049950,out there on Instagram right now is startling. It is time to do and less
L8UT0iVne24,1049950,1053750,talking and more doing.
L8UT0iVne24,1055680,1059730,This is a matter of life and death. I don't know who told y'all. I
L8UT0iVne24,1059730,1063210,"don't know who told y'all this was about math, this is about English, this is about"
L8UT0iVne24,1063210,1065549,"science, right y'all thinking why do I need math to blow up? Why do I need English"
L8UT0iVne24,1065550,1068370,"to blow up? Look this is not about, this is not about what you think it is."
L8UT0iVne24,1068370,1073260,This is life and death. School is about setting a foundation. Are you hear what
L8UT0iVne24,1073260,1077190,I'm telling you? I need you to try. I need you to try to read every single word. If
L8UT0iVne24,1077190,1080429,"you don't know it, write it down, look it up. I need you to try to do every single"

L8UT0iVne24,1083970,1087840,try because I know something about you. I know something about you. I know when you
L8UT0iVne24,1087840,1091260,put forth 120 percent effort it ain't nothing you can't do. It ain't nothing
L8UT0iVne24,1091260,1094200,you can't accomplish. I don't want you to live to die anymore. I want you to die to
L8UT0iVne24,1094200,1098100,"live because I know if you try, I know if you put forth 120"
L8UT0iVne24,1098100,1102809,percent effort it ain't nothing you can't do but live in a world of freedom
L8UT0iVne24,1102810,1110910,and that's yours to have. That's a choice that you can make. That's a decision that
L8UT0iVne24,1110910,1118320,"you can follow through on, that you can carry out, you gotta wanna make this"
L8UT0iVne24,1118320,1125549,thing work for you. You gotta make today count. What are you doing with your time?
L8UT0iVne24,1125550,1130860,"Are you wasting it, are you going to make today count because it's precious or are"
L8UT0iVne24,1130860,1137309,you gonna let it just slip away? Let it fade? You need to be in a peak
L8UT0iVne24,1137310,1143610,"state at all times. That's gonna be predicated on your will, your intensity"
L8UT0iVne24,1143610,1149220,"your integrity, your character, your energy, your effort, to get what you want"
L8UT0iVne24,1149220,1155240,out of this life. It's on you.
L8UT0iVne24,1156929,1163240,"It's hard to put the effort in to create greatness, but it's a lot"
L8UT0iVne24,1163240,1168510,harder to accept the reality that you could have been great.
L8UT0iVne24,1169889,1173970,"I want you to know something, that the bigger your dream is, I want you"
L8UT0iVne24,1173970,1176989,understand the heart of the grind.
L8UT0iVne24,1179460,1192559,Listen to me- luck is for leprechauns and you ain't green. Luck is for leprechauns
L8UT0iVne24,1192559,1196130,and you're not green.
L8UT0iVne24,1199049,1203549,I'm gonna say it again. Luck is for leprechauns and you're not green. What I
L8UT0iVne24,1203549,1207658,"am Telling You is that if you're willing to go beast mode, you can have whatever"
L8UT0iVne24,1207659,1215639,"you want. I'm a living example. You can start from nothing, start from nothing"
L8UT0iVne24,1215639,1218610,"you know the story. Mom was a teenage mom, start with"
L8UT0iVne24,1218610,1223230,"nothing. Grandma had 14 kids, start with nothing, two bedroom house, one bathroom"
L8UT0iVne24,1223230,1231629,mom got kicked out because she had me start with nothing. Start with nothing
L8UT0iVne24,1231629,1236279,"high school dropout, start with nothing homeless, twelve years to get a four-year"
L8UT0iVne24,1236279,1243769,"degree from the University, start with nothing. If you are willing to grind.. I"
L8UT0iVne24,1244580,1249028,believe effort and you've heard me say it. You might come from priv- you might
L8UT0iVne24,1249029,1253200,have a father that can give you everything your little heart desires but
L8UT0iVne24,1253200,1259950,you will not outwork me.
L8UT0iVne24,1260150,1265110,"Listen to me: I told you, I told you, I told you, I want you to think about those"
L8UT0iVne24,1265110,1269190,goals. I want you to taste them. I want you to- I want you to be- I want you to
L8UT0iVne24,1269190,1272519,internalize it. I'm not asking you to tell me what your goals are because I'm
L8UT0iVne24,1272520,1275430,interested hearing everybody will- I couldn't- I couldn't possibly do
L8UT0iVne24,1275430,1277800,"anything with it. Listen, this is what I'm telling you. I'm telling you to dream"
L8UT0iVne24,1277800,1285309,"your dream because I want you to feel it, I want you to taste it"
L8UT0iVne24,1285309,1288789,"I want you to know how close, I want you just like when the weather is changing"
L8UT0iVne24,1288789,1293138,you can feel it. I want you to be able to feel when you're getting closer to it
L8UT0iVne24,1293139,1297190,and closer to it but more importantly I want you to know when you dream your
L8UT0iVne24,1297190,1303908,dream that there are other people who are dreaming the exact same dream. You
L8UT0iVne24,1303909,1308980,"might be the ant and the ant has very little but he's determined, he's strong"
L8UT0iVne24,1308980,1314230,he has a dream and a goal and he'll do whatever it takes and I need you to
L8UT0iVne24,1314230,1323379,"understand that the bigger your dream is, the earlier you will have to get up. The"
L8UT0iVne24,1323379,1327100,"bigger your dream is, the earlier you will have to get up, the longer you gonna"
L8UT0iVne24,1327100,1330970,"have to stay up, the bigger your dream is the more effort you gonna have to put in"
L8UT0iVne24,1330970,1340860,"and for those of you who raise your hand and put up 70%, you'll never see it."
L8UT0iVne24,1342480,1351620,"You'll never see it for those of you who are 70%, 70% beast mode, 30% gazelle."
L8UT0iVne24,1356000,1359720,"When you said to yourself when the ball comes out, this is what I want to"
L8UT0iVne24,1359720,1363320,"accomplish, you're not the only person that wants to accomplish it and now I"
L8UT0iVne24,1363320,1368600,ask you this question. What do you do when a thousand other people want
L8UT0iVne24,1368600,1378169,exactly what you want? What do you do when you're not the only one that wants
L8UT0iVne24,1378170,1381440,to make a million dollars a year company you're not the only one that wants to be
L8UT0iVne24,1381440,1384830,"the president, you're not the only one that wants to be a CEO, what if you're"
L8UT0iVne24,1384830,1388880,"not the only one that wants what you want, what if there are thousands of"
L8UT0iVne24,1388880,1400710,other people who want what you want? You have to outwork them.
L8UT0iVne24,1400760,1405980,"You gotta out-grind them, you got to get up earlier, you got to stay up later"
L8UT0iVne24,1405980,1418340,you've got to execute and you've got to go from 70 to 120.
L8UT0iVne24,1418340,1422730,No excuses guys I wish I could- I wish you could pay me a thousand dollars
L8UT0iVne24,1422730,1428400,today and I could tell you 70% is enough. I wish you could pay me 15 I wish you
L8UT0iVne24,1428400,1436480,could pay me 1500 but it's not gonna happen.
L8UT0iVne24,1436480,1440440,"You're thinking- you're thinking- I want you to get it out your system, you're"
L8UT0iVne24,1440440,1444368,thinking I'm gonna work hard for 10 years then I'll relax and if that's what
L8UT0iVne24,1444369,1448080,"you're thinking, this ain't for you."
