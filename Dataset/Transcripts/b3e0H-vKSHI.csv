b3e0H-vKSHI,216720,218720,put into the mcflurry i agree with that
b3e0H-vKSHI,218720,220480,i like the considerate of coconut milk
b3e0H-vKSHI,220480,223120,rather than the whole milk but we're so

b3e0H-vKSHI,688160,690800,i can't believe it the dryness to it
b3e0H-vKSHI,690800,693040,it's just it's like i'm at the beach in
b3e0H-vKSHI,693040,695360,the desert with nothing to drink is that
b3e0H-vKSHI,695360,697519,a good thing or a bad thing it's a bad
b3e0H-vKSHI,697519,699440,thing you know my quesorito i thought it
b3e0H-vKSHI,699440,701440,looked spectacular but
b3e0H-vKSHI,701440,703680,it was a little too dry next time i'll
b3e0H-vKSHI,703680,706480,add more sauce and maybe a little bit of
b3e0H-vKSHI,706480,708720,water i don't know i'm not a chef
b3e0H-vKSHI,708720,711440,i think it was actually pretty good it

b3e0H-vKSHI,713760,715680,the middle people don't realize there's
b3e0H-vKSHI,715680,717600,a bun in the middle of big mac i pay
b3e0H-vKSHI,717600,719200,attention to detail
b3e0H-vKSHI,719200,722079,okay burger or taco if i was in a desert
b3e0H-vKSHI,722079,724480,and i just had dirt or taco i'd probably
b3e0H-vKSHI,724480,726320,choose the dirt still washing down the
b3e0H-vKSHI,726320,728560,taco they both have cheese in it so i
b3e0H-vKSHI,728560,729920,think we should give them another chance

b3e0H-vKSHI,731440,733519,okay mm-hmm that's an easy thing to make
