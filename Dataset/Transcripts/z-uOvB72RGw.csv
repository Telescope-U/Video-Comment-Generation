z-uOvB72RGw,114799,115840,actually it caught the attention of
z-uOvB72RGw,115840,118000,another channel danny gonzalez it's just
z-uOvB72RGw,118000,120159,like a home improvement game like a

z-uOvB72RGw,121840,123920,in question is merge mansion which saw
z-uOvB72RGw,123920,126159,lily's garden adds and said hold my beer
z-uOvB72RGw,126159,128160,creating an entire ad campaign revolving
z-uOvB72RGw,128160,130560,around its mysterious and confusing lore
z-uOvB72RGw,130560,133200,wedding breakups mysterious fires secret
z-uOvB72RGw,133200,136080,affairs and murder is all of this
z-uOvB72RGw,136080,138400,context and backstory important if i
z-uOvB72RGw,138400,140080,downloaded the game so i've got an empty
z-uOvB72RGw,140080,142319,spot in my garden i can either plant a
z-uOvB72RGw,142319,145120,tree or build a statue keeping in mind
z-uOvB72RGw,145120,147680,that my fiance did either die or stand
z-uOvB72RGw,147680,149440,me up on my wedding day i think the
z-uOvB72RGw,149440,150879,choice is actually pretty clear i'm
z-uOvB72RGw,150879,152560,going back to therapy but what really
z-uOvB72RGw,152560,153920,caused this game to blow up was the
z-uOvB72RGw,153920,155760,final shot from one of its ads here we
z-uOvB72RGw,155760,157680,have our innocent and loving grandma the
z-uOvB72RGw,157680,159599,woman who comforted us after we were
z-uOvB72RGw,159599,161760,jilted at the altar the dear sweet lady
z-uOvB72RGw,161760,163920,who gave us a derelict mansion to repair
z-uOvB72RGw,163920,166239,she's taken in by the cops and then
z-uOvB72RGw,166239,168480,biggest anime betrayal of all time a
z-uOvB72RGw,168480,171280,message is written on her hand you're
z-uOvB72RGw,171280,174800,next twitter exploded about this game
z-uOvB72RGw,174800,176959,and everyone was asking the same
z-uOvB72RGw,176959,179120,question what the hell did grandma do
z-uOvB72RGw,179120,181840,well danny and internet at large that is
z-uOvB72RGw,181840,184000,what i aim to answer today what is the
z-uOvB72RGw,184000,186239,mystery of the merge mansion what's
z-uOvB72RGw,186239,188159,granny's menacing message referring to
z-uOvB72RGw,188159,189680,and seriously how does a locket of
z-uOvB72RGw,189680,191360,family photos merge together into a
z-uOvB72RGw,191360,193519,garden rake all that and more except for
z-uOvB72RGw,193519,195599,maybe the last one today as we explore
z-uOvB72RGw,195599,197040,the lore
z-uOvB72RGw,197040,199760,of yet another weird mobile video game
z-uOvB72RGw,199760,201599,ad campaign you happy for your free
z-uOvB72RGw,201599,204000,promotion game you got me in total there
z-uOvB72RGw,204000,206000,are only like six or seven ad spots plus
z-uOvB72RGw,206000,207680,the lore that's delivered in game by
z-uOvB72RGw,207680,209680,granny so unlike lily's garden we're
z-uOvB72RGw,209680,211599,thankfully not dealing with hundreds of
z-uOvB72RGw,211599,213680,short 30 second videos this time so
z-uOvB72RGw,213680,215120,let's start at the beginning our story
z-uOvB72RGw,215120,216799,begins with lead character maddie in a
z-uOvB72RGw,216799,218959,wedding dress mascara running down her
z-uOvB72RGw,218959,220879,face clearly her wedding didn't go as
z-uOvB72RGw,220879,222879,planned with her fiance either not
z-uOvB72RGw,222879,224400,showing up or running out of the
z-uOvB72RGw,224400,226640,ceremony either way jerk move there bro
z-uOvB72RGw,226640,228239,but of course the bad news doesn't stop
z-uOvB72RGw,228239,230239,there she gets out of the taxi only to
z-uOvB72RGw,230239,232560,see her house has been burned down can i
z-uOvB72RGw,232560,234080,just digress here and say that i love
z-uOvB72RGw,234080,236080,her reaction in this moment just little
z-uOvB72RGw,236080,237920,slumping of the shoulders cause yeah
z-uOvB72RGw,237920,239599,that is the appropriate reaction when
z-uOvB72RGw,239599,241680,you see your life go up in flames anyway
z-uOvB72RGw,241680,243599,she immediately gets a call from granny
z-uOvB72RGw,243599,246400,ursula good timing there gran uncanny
z-uOvB72RGw,246400,247840,maddie accepts the call and in a
z-uOvB72RGw,247840,249920,separate ad titled wedding we see maddie
z-uOvB72RGw,249920,251519,tear up a photo of her and her fiance
z-uOvB72RGw,251519,254319,together so weird detail since you know
z-uOvB72RGw,254319,256479,she's both wearing her wedding dress and
z-uOvB72RGw,256479,258400,in the dress in the picture like how did
z-uOvB72RGw,258400,260239,she get a photo from the wedding if the
z-uOvB72RGw,260239,262160,wedding didn't happen this proves that
z-uOvB72RGw,262160,264160,at the very least her fiance whose name
z-uOvB72RGw,264160,265919,we later learn is arthur must have
z-uOvB72RGw,265919,268000,gotten cold feet at the altar and
z-uOvB72RGw,268000,270479,physically ran away maybe they both got
z-uOvB72RGw,270479,272320,dressed up but upon seeing the dress the
z-uOvB72RGw,272320,274320,fiancee suddenly got cold feet and ran
z-uOvB72RGw,274320,276479,after the photo was taken also polaroid
z-uOvB72RGw,276479,278320,photos for the wedding i recognize you
z-uOvB72RGw,278320,280479,hipster move well done but granny's
z-uOvB72RGw,280479,282320,there once again to the rescue by
z-uOvB72RGw,282320,284479,offering maddie a place to stay the old
z-uOvB72RGw,284479,286960,family mansion which gotta admit sounds
z-uOvB72RGw,286960,289120,great until you actually see it it could
z-uOvB72RGw,289120,290960,use some work we actually get two
z-uOvB72RGw,290960,292880,versions of this part of the story one
z-uOvB72RGw,292880,294560,in the cg style that we've seen and
z-uOvB72RGw,294560,296240,another in the art style of the actual
z-uOvB72RGw,296240,298080,game in it we're shown a newspaper
z-uOvB72RGw,298080,300479,headline revealing a few key details one
z-uOvB72RGw,300479,302560,that maddie is actually a bit of a local
z-uOvB72RGw,302560,305520,celebrity and two that she was pied off
z-uOvB72RGw,305520,308560,by her fiance paid off hideoff i've
z-uOvB72RGw,308560,310160,never heard of this before is that is
z-uOvB72RGw,310160,312400,this a real thing
z-uOvB72RGw,312400,315039,uh yeah i guess it is weird is this like
z-uOvB72RGw,315039,316639,some sort of old saying that's being
z-uOvB72RGw,316639,318880,brought back by gen z yo girl it was
z-uOvB72RGw,318880,320320,poggers when you told me that you loved
z-uOvB72RGw,320320,322000,me but then you went and pied off and
z-uOvB72RGw,322000,323759,now i'm all pepe hands hurts to be
z-uOvB72RGw,323759,325680,debated like that i'm omega lol
z-uOvB72RGw,325680,327360,regardless the article also tells us
z-uOvB72RGw,327360,328960,that she's been scammed by arthur and
z-uOvB72RGw,328960,331360,that she's now and i quote big sad so
z-uOvB72RGw,331360,332880,with nothing left to her name maddie
z-uOvB72RGw,332880,334639,takes granny's offer and decides to fix
z-uOvB72RGw,334639,336639,up the mansion however if you do the
z-uOvB72RGw,336639,339440,unthinkable and actually play the game
z-uOvB72RGw,339440,340639,you quickly learn that the city
z-uOvB72RGw,340639,342479,inspector roddy deems the house is too
z-uOvB72RGw,342479,344000,dangerous and threatens to demolish the
z-uOvB72RGw,344000,345759,whole thing if it's not repaired soon
z-uOvB72RGw,345759,347280,later on in the story he even takes the
z-uOvB72RGw,347280,349199,hands-on approach by offering to help
z-uOvB72RGw,349199,351199,himself which gotta admit awfully nice
z-uOvB72RGw,351199,352720,of him who knew that city inspectors
z-uOvB72RGw,352720,354639,could be so generous with their time oh
z-uOvB72RGw,354639,356560,wait they can't in the video perfect day
z-uOvB72RGw,356560,358240,we see maddie accidentally slip on a
z-uOvB72RGw,358240,360479,rake and in so doing falls into the arms
z-uOvB72RGw,360479,362000,of the inspector in the next video
z-uOvB72RGw,362000,363919,gardening we see clothes strewn about as
z-uOvB72RGw,363919,365840,maddie climbs out of a rose bush which
z-uOvB72RGw,365840,368560,gotta say bad choice of bush there like
z-uOvB72RGw,368560,370639,is nobody concerned about the thorns
z-uOvB72RGw,370639,372240,anyway i think you can tell where this
z-uOvB72RGw,372240,374560,one's going after maddie leaves out pops
z-uOvB72RGw,374560,376240,the inspector i mean maddie's a
z-uOvB72RGw,376240,378000,celebrity we've already established that
z-uOvB72RGw,378000,379120,she could probably have had her pick of
z-uOvB72RGw,379120,382000,the chads and yet she chooses him i
z-uOvB72RGw,382000,383600,don't think so think this is more of a
z-uOvB72RGw,383600,385840,tactical decision by wooing him maddie
z-uOvB72RGw,385840,387199,gets to keep the demolition of the
z-uOvB72RGw,387199,388960,mansion delayed sometimes who knows
z-uOvB72RGw,388960,390560,he'll even help out speaking of helping
z-uOvB72RGw,390560,393360,out grandma's also there in the bush yep
z-uOvB72RGw,393360,395360,a third person reaches up from the bush
z-uOvB72RGw,395360,397360,to pull the inspector back down and look
z-uOvB72RGw,397360,399440,at that flared sleeve there it's a match
z-uOvB72RGw,399440,401199,for granny's outfit and every scene that
z-uOvB72RGw,401199,404080,we see her in i suppose love is blind to
z-uOvB72RGw,404080,406639,age and apparently to also being in the
z-uOvB72RGw,406639,409120,same family they must really want to
z-uOvB72RGw,409120,410639,keep this mansion and while we're on the
z-uOvB72RGw,410639,412000,subject of granny it seems like her
z-uOvB72RGw,412000,414160,motives in this are twofold first while
z-uOvB72RGw,414160,415360,on the surface it seems like she wants
z-uOvB72RGw,415360,416639,to help maddie during a rough patch in
z-uOvB72RGw,416639,418639,her life in reality she's just using
z-uOvB72RGw,418639,420720,maddie for free labor to fix the mansion
z-uOvB72RGw,420720,423120,i mean she doesn't help at all except
z-uOvB72RGw,423120,424880,for that stuff in the bush
z-uOvB72RGw,424880,426560,we see her drinking cocktails on the
z-uOvB72RGw,426560,428400,roof relaxing in the pool ignoring
z-uOvB72RGw,428400,430240,maddie's calls for help in game whenever
z-uOvB72RGw,430240,432400,granny shows up at the end of a mission
z-uOvB72RGw,432400,434560,and it is always at the end when things
z-uOvB72RGw,434560,436400,are all fixed up she tends to drop
z-uOvB72RGw,436400,437759,little tidbits about the mansion and the
z-uOvB72RGw,437759,439199,family history like the fact that they
z-uOvB72RGw,439199,440800,earned a family fortune from crazy
z-uOvB72RGw,440800,442800,inventions like the tin can the spray
z-uOvB72RGw,442800,444800,can and the skateboard but whenever
z-uOvB72RGw,444800,446400,maddie asks for more information about
z-uOvB72RGw,446400,448319,why the mansion was locked away granny
z-uOvB72RGw,448319,450240,makes an excuse usually something to do
z-uOvB72RGw,450240,451840,with pie and the answers have to wait
z-uOvB72RGw,451840,453919,for another day well done game some apps
z-uOvB72RGw,453919,455280,keep you planned with small micro
z-uOvB72RGw,455280,456800,transactions but you're the first one
z-uOvB72RGw,456800,458479,that actually gets me you know that all
z-uOvB72RGw,458479,461039,i need is that slow drip feed of lore
z-uOvB72RGw,461039,463440,directly into my brain also caffeine
z-uOvB72RGw,463440,464879,definitely addicted to caffeine at this
z-uOvB72RGw,464879,466639,point which brings us to the two videos
z-uOvB72RGw,466639,469280,that started it all criminal and mystery
z-uOvB72RGw,469280,471039,see granny isn't just hiding secrets
z-uOvB72RGw,471039,473039,about the family she's hiding her own
z-uOvB72RGw,473039,474720,secrets in the video criminal we see
z-uOvB72RGw,474720,476240,granny leaving the house with an
z-uOvB72RGw,476240,478000,envelope on the side table reading the
z-uOvB72RGw,478000,480800,story of our family i'm sorry sorry
z-uOvB72RGw,480800,482720,sorry for what this is then followed up
z-uOvB72RGw,482720,484240,by mystery where she gets into the
z-uOvB72RGw,484240,486080,police car and we see that infamous
z-uOvB72RGw,486080,488400,writing on her hand what though is she
z-uOvB72RGw,488400,490879,being arrested for well i would say
z-uOvB72RGw,490879,492879,arson remember maddie's house and how it
z-uOvB72RGw,492879,494319,burned down at the start of all this and
z-uOvB72RGw,494319,496479,how just in the nick of time granny
z-uOvB72RGw,496479,498000,comes a call in with a comforting
z-uOvB72RGw,498000,499840,shoulder and a brand new house that gosh
z-uOvB72RGw,499840,501280,darn it just needs a little bit of
z-uOvB72RGw,501280,503520,fixing up her timing here is awfully
z-uOvB72RGw,503520,506160,suspicious i think she set the fire
z-uOvB72RGw,506160,508160,consider this maddie is devastated about
z-uOvB72RGw,508160,509759,being left at the altar and it means
z-uOvB72RGw,509759,511199,she's gonna be stuck at the ceremony for
z-uOvB72RGw,511199,512959,a while dealing with guests being
z-uOvB72RGw,512959,514640,comforted by friends things like that
z-uOvB72RGw,514640,516800,you'd assume that granny as a family
z-uOvB72RGw,516800,518320,member would be there too to act as an
z-uOvB72RGw,518320,520159,emotional support except we know for a
z-uOvB72RGw,520159,522560,fact that she wasn't because she calls
z-uOvB72RGw,522560,524320,back later that day to help maddie
z-uOvB72RGw,524320,525680,through her feelings about both the
z-uOvB72RGw,525680,527760,wedding and the fire all this time with
z-uOvB72RGw,527760,529519,maddie at the ceremony then gives granny
z-uOvB72RGw,529519,531040,plenty of time to sneak away and cause
z-uOvB72RGw,531040,533440,the fire why would she do something like
z-uOvB72RGw,533440,535760,that well granny clearly wants free
z-uOvB72RGw,535760,537760,labor to fix the mansion and she sees a
z-uOvB72RGw,537760,539760,vulnerable family member who can do
z-uOvB72RGw,539760,542080,exactly that by offering to help maddie
z-uOvB72RGw,542080,543519,through this difficult period in her
z-uOvB72RGw,543519,545839,life it suddenly makes maddie dependent
z-uOvB72RGw,545839,548000,on her so is that then why granny's
z-uOvB72RGw,548000,550399,getting arrested for arson well it's not
z-uOvB72RGw,550399,551920,actually the end of it in this gameplay
z-uOvB72RGw,551920,553680,advertisement we see another news
z-uOvB72RGw,553680,556000,article with the headline killer grandma
z-uOvB72RGw,556000,558800,caught she killed someone who well the
z-uOvB72RGw,558800,560320,answer i think is a pretty obvious one
z-uOvB72RGw,560320,561760,there's a character that's only ever
z-uOvB72RGw,561760,564000,mentioned briefly but is never spoken of
z-uOvB72RGw,564000,566959,or seen again the fiancee arthur to be
z-uOvB72RGw,566959,569200,clear we do see him in the first ever ad
z-uOvB72RGw,569200,570959,spot for the game but this spot also
z-uOvB72RGw,570959,572480,features some details that directly
z-uOvB72RGw,572480,574560,contradict every other major story point
z-uOvB72RGw,574560,576080,that we get from all the other ads and
z-uOvB72RGw,576080,577920,the game itself so i think that this one
z-uOvB72RGw,577920,579760,just kind of got swept under the rug in
z-uOvB72RGw,579760,581680,retconned way and i gotta admit i don't
z-uOvB72RGw,581680,583279,have a lot of hard evidence for this one
z-uOvB72RGw,583279,584480,but i do have a decent amount of
z-uOvB72RGw,584480,586399,circumstantial evidence first off did
z-uOvB72RGw,586399,588640,you see my lily's garden video exes like
z-uOvB72RGw,588640,590320,this don't just disappear in these
z-uOvB72RGw,590320,592399,mobile game ads in the lily's garden
z-uOvB72RGw,592399,594399,universe lily's ex-fiancee shows up
z-uOvB72RGw,594399,596560,constantly well after their relationship
z-uOvB72RGw,596560,598959,ends so why would merge mansion a very
z-uOvB72RGw,598959,601200,similar game following a very similar ad
z-uOvB72RGw,601200,603279,campaign not include this sort of key
z-uOvB72RGw,603279,605839,character unless he physically can't be
z-uOvB72RGw,605839,608560,included he can't show up because granny
z-uOvB72RGw,608560,611519,killed maddie's fiancee we do see in one
z-uOvB72RGw,611519,613440,of the ads that granny starts to tell
z-uOvB72RGw,613440,615440,maddie something about her ex-fiance and
z-uOvB72RGw,615440,617519,then the ad cuts out suspicious right if
z-uOvB72RGw,617519,618959,you left someone at the altar the first
z-uOvB72RGw,618959,620640,thing you'd do is go home and pack your
z-uOvB72RGw,620640,621920,things to make some sort of quick
z-uOvB72RGw,621920,624240,getaway right i suspect arthur may have
z-uOvB72RGw,624240,626800,done something exactly like that but he
z-uOvB72RGw,626800,629200,got caught granny saw him sneak away and
z-uOvB72RGw,629200,631040,knew exactly what he was doing she
z-uOvB72RGw,631040,632880,followed him home and set his house on
z-uOvB72RGw,632880,634800,fire with him inside which leads us
z-uOvB72RGw,634800,637200,finally to the hand message what does it
z-uOvB72RGw,637200,639519,mean or should i say what do they mean
z-uOvB72RGw,639519,641600,you see there's not just one but three
z-uOvB72RGw,641600,643680,separate messages ending this mysterious
z-uOvB72RGw,643680,647120,ad campaign you're next he's alive and i
z-uOvB72RGw,647120,649040,planned this clearly this is just the
z-uOvB72RGw,649040,650720,case of a mobile game ad trying to
z-uOvB72RGw,650720,652160,optimize for click-through rate by
z-uOvB72RGw,652160,653760,making a small change which is something
z-uOvB72RGw,653760,654800,that we actually talked about in our
z-uOvB72RGw,654800,656800,past mobile game episode but still which
z-uOvB72RGw,656800,659040,one of the messages is real which is
z-uOvB72RGw,659040,661360,right well what if i told you that all
z-uOvB72RGw,661360,662800,of them are let's start with the
z-uOvB72RGw,662800,664720,weirdest one he's alive right now there
z-uOvB72RGw,664720,666399,are only three men in the series the
z-uOvB72RGw,666399,668320,inspector granny's friend julius and the
z-uOvB72RGw,668320,670720,ex-fiancee arthur both the inspector and
z-uOvB72RGw,670720,673040,julius are alive so not gonna be them
z-uOvB72RGw,673040,674800,like yeah obviously he's still alive
z-uOvB72RGw,674800,676399,granny he was just helping us trim the
z-uOvB72RGw,676399,678560,bush this afternoon wink wink in the
z-uOvB72RGw,678560,680399,game lore granny tells stories about her
z-uOvB72RGw,680399,682640,husband grandpa charlie and while he
z-uOvB72RGw,682640,684800,does appear to be dead there's nothing
z-uOvB72RGw,684800,686640,really scandalous or interesting about
z-uOvB72RGw,686640,688480,him to warrant something like this the
z-uOvB72RGw,688480,690160,only person it would make sense for it
z-uOvB72RGw,690160,692640,to refer to is the ex-fiance he went
z-uOvB72RGw,692640,694079,home after running out of the wedding
z-uOvB72RGw,694079,695839,got caught in what people believed to be
z-uOvB72RGw,695839,697360,an accidental house fire and was
z-uOvB72RGw,697360,699440,declared dead that's the story that
z-uOvB72RGw,699440,701760,people know but in reality granny saw
z-uOvB72RGw,701760,703600,him and set the fire with him still in
z-uOvB72RGw,703600,705519,the house when they discovered her arson
z-uOvB72RGw,705519,707839,she got pinned for killing him as well
z-uOvB72RGw,707839,709440,he's alive might also lead us to what
z-uOvB72RGw,709440,711440,granny plans next when she drives off
z-uOvB72RGw,711440,713920,she's got an evil grin on her face she
z-uOvB72RGw,713920,716399,plans on finishing the job but how is
z-uOvB72RGw,716399,717920,she gonna do that when she's in prison
z-uOvB72RGw,717920,719839,she's not she's in the process of
z-uOvB72RGw,719839,721440,busting out remember one of the other
z-uOvB72RGw,721440,723760,phrases on the hand was i planned this
z-uOvB72RGw,723760,725040,which makes sense when you think about
z-uOvB72RGw,725040,726639,the envelope that she left on the table
z-uOvB72RGw,726639,728560,before being taken in by the cops she
z-uOvB72RGw,728560,729920,couldn't have just written that note
z-uOvB72RGw,729920,731760,once the police arrived she knew that
z-uOvB72RGw,731760,734079,they were coming for her but this is
z-uOvB72RGw,734079,735920,where granny's long-term planning kicks
z-uOvB72RGw,735920,737680,in in the ad where we see her in prison
z-uOvB72RGw,737680,739920,we see granny putting some massive thing
z-uOvB72RGw,739920,742079,inside of a pie it looks to be some kind
z-uOvB72RGw,742079,744560,of a file or lock pick which she plants
z-uOvB72RGw,744560,746399,in the pie for maddie to bring with her
z-uOvB72RGw,746399,748480,to prison with all of granny's talk of
z-uOvB72RGw,748480,750160,pies throughout the game her ever-loving
z-uOvB72RGw,750160,751760,granddaughter would bring the pie to
z-uOvB72RGw,751760,753760,granny not being aware of what's inside
z-uOvB72RGw,753760,755839,granny is planning a prison break she
z-uOvB72RGw,755839,757519,can then run away change her identity
z-uOvB72RGw,757519,758720,and set up somewhere nice with her
z-uOvB72RGw,758720,760560,family's secret fortune but that then
z-uOvB72RGw,760560,762480,leaves us with the last phrase you're
z-uOvB72RGw,762480,764480,next well if i'm right about granny
z-uOvB72RGw,764480,766480,planning a prison escape then maddie is
z-uOvB72RGw,766480,768560,technically an accomplice to that crime
z-uOvB72RGw,768560,769839,and would be considered to be an
z-uOvB72RGw,769839,771360,accessory after the fact and in the
z-uOvB72RGw,771360,772880,state of maryland which is the setting
z-uOvB72RGw,772880,774399,of the game based on the news articles
z-uOvB72RGw,774399,776240,that talk about the mcpd or the
z-uOvB72RGw,776240,778160,montgomery county police department in
z-uOvB72RGw,778160,780240,baltimore maddie is likely to get up to
z-uOvB72RGw,780240,782959,10 years in prison and that might not be
z-uOvB72RGw,782959,784560,our only conviction once they start
z-uOvB72RGw,784560,786320,looking into maddie they might find the
z-uOvB72RGw,786320,788079,series of events currently blamed on
z-uOvB72RGw,788079,790079,granny to be a little suspect house
z-uOvB72RGw,790079,791680,being burned down to claim insurance
z-uOvB72RGw,791680,794000,money fiance being murdered fooling
z-uOvB72RGw,794000,796160,around with a city inspector if anything
z-uOvB72RGw,796160,798399,maddie should be suspect number one for
z-uOvB72RGw,798399,800720,all these crimes so the your next could
z-uOvB72RGw,800720,802480,indeed be granny showing her hand
z-uOvB72RGw,802480,804480,revealing that she set up all these
z-uOvB72RGw,804480,806480,dominoes so that maddie is eventually
z-uOvB72RGw,806480,808480,the one that takes the fall for
z-uOvB72RGw,808480,811279,everything granny is not nice in fact
z-uOvB72RGw,811279,813200,she is pure evil out for her own
z-uOvB72RGw,813200,814720,personal gain with a little bit of
z-uOvB72RGw,814720,816720,murder on the side once the police focus
z-uOvB72RGw,816720,818240,on maddie and once the mansion's
z-uOvB72RGw,818240,820079,repaired granny will be able to get the
z-uOvB72RGw,820079,822240,family fortune and sail away off into
z-uOvB72RGw,822240,824560,the horizon never seen or heard from
z-uOvB72RGw,824560,826560,again which would then lead to perhaps
z-uOvB72RGw,826560,828720,the biggest twist of them all the fact
z-uOvB72RGw,828720,830560,that the game plays literally nothing
z-uOvB72RGw,830560,833279,like any of this in the first place but
z-uOvB72RGw,833279,837760,hey that's just a theory a game theory
z-uOvB72RGw,837760,840000,thanks for watching
z-uOvB72RGw,840000,847279,[Music]
z-uOvB72RGw,847279,850279,so
z-uOvB72RGw,851690,858959,[Music]
z-uOvB72RGw,858959,861040,you
