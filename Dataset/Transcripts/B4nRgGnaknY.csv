B4nRgGnaknY,448479,456400,sauce chicken ah that was fantastic  experience  i love the look of this entire plate of
B4nRgGnaknY,456400,462800,food this looks like ultimate comfort  food for me  you got the rice you've got the soy  sauce braised chicken the bean sprouts
B4nRgGnaknY,462800,468960,salad and i got some of the bean curd  tofu which is extremely soft and jiggly
B4nRgGnaknY,468960,474479,and then it comes with a  sauce on the side  let's have to begin with that chicken
B4nRgGnaknY,474479,480000,with some other rice  oh and it's boneless too you pretty much  took out the bones
B4nRgGnaknY,480000,485599,uh so you just have  that skin  the white meat and you gotta take a
B4nRgGnaknY,485599,491280,closer look at this chicken  you can see the  the chicken skin
B4nRgGnaknY,491280,498479,nicely separating from the meat that  gelatinous bit  oh the white of the meat looks really
B4nRgGnaknY,498479,504759,really like a perfect texture you can  see the juices coming out of it
B4nRgGnaknY,509599,515560,okay  you have a little bit of the backbone in  it
B4nRgGnaknY,520800,526640,all the texture of that chicken  is incredible well first of all you've  got that amazing flavor of the soya
B4nRgGnaknY,526640,532959,sauce which is just kind of glistening  and a little bit salty but it provides  this umami to the skin which then
B4nRgGnaknY,532959,540160,absorbs into the chicken meat itself the  chicken itself has this incredible i  wouldn't call it jelly but it's so soft
B4nRgGnaknY,540160,546720,and so moist almost to the point where  it has a gelatinous texture to it oh the  chicken itself is incredible
B4nRgGnaknY,546720,553600,oh man yeah can you see the interior of  that chicken  oh it's so moist that texture is
B4nRgGnaknY,553600,559760,unbelievable  i'm gonna move into that wobbly tofu for  my next bite that wobbliness that
B4nRgGnaknY,559760,567279,jiggliness  well totally a silken tofu just
B4nRgGnaknY,567279,572000,completely  liquefies into a
B4nRgGnaknY,572320,578880,it's one of those tofus where you can  just squeeze it between your teeth and  it liquefies  i like it
B4nRgGnaknY,580240,586760,and then got me a  tea while i was filming
B4nRgGnaknY,595519,600800,great let's move back to the chicken  this time i want to add a little bit of  that  acidity i think this might be a vinegar
B4nRgGnaknY,600800,606880,or chili sauce  all right so that's gonna
B4nRgGnaknY,606880,615320,probably add some acidity to it and just  kind of contrast the flavor of that  that salty soy sauce
B4nRgGnaknY,619360,625839,that's really outstandingly good a  little bit of ginger in the sauce a  little bit of yeah vinegar i think  not really spicy
B4nRgGnaknY,625839,631120,but um  yeah mostly ginger that complements it  well i love the chicken that rice is
B4nRgGnaknY,631120,638800,also so fragrant  [Music]
B4nRgGnaknY,638800,644160,okay and so that completes dish number  two  we are moving on and continuing with

B4nRgGnaknY,810959,816720,which give it a slight woody earthy  taste and it has this amazing natural  sweetness that's the definition of
B4nRgGnaknY,816720,823600,chicken soup for the soul okay i'm  moving in  to the chicken  and looks like we've got a
B4nRgGnaknY,823600,829920,a wing a wing combo here this is the  type of chicken that if you shake the  bone will just fall right out and this
B4nRgGnaknY,829920,835519,is also the type of soup that you really  have to be careful about taking too big  of a bite and just completely burning
B4nRgGnaknY,835519,838760,your tongue
B4nRgGnaknY,845040,850880,the bone is just completely tender  oh wow i mean not the bone is just

B4nRgGnaknY,913760,920240,amazing dish i mean  you would think to eat this dish herbal  black chicken soup at a higher end
B4nRgGnaknY,920240,926880,gourmet chinese restaurant but here at  this hawker center floor  i think it was five dollars and fifty
B4nRgGnaknY,926880,933519,cents  it is absolutely incredible oh and then  additionally he serves you a bit of tea

B4nRgGnaknY,1016800,1022720,walking around the market a little bit  more this is one of the places i was  probably most looking forward to in this
B4nRgGnaknY,1022720,1027760,entire tour of the chinatown complex  we are here line is not too long
B4nRgGnaknY,1027760,1034079,although i know a lot of people said the  line can be really long and then also  that they have really sporadic and
B4nRgGnaknY,1034079,1038918,actually really short opening hours
B4nRgGnaknY,1041120,1048720,i'm at the front of the line now got my  order in they make everything here fresh  right within this 10 by 10 stall and it
B4nRgGnaknY,1048720,1054480,just smells so good  they  were featured in the michelin guide a
B4nRgGnaknY,1054480,1060640,number of times throughout the years and  man they're just again everything fresh
B4nRgGnaknY,1060640,1067080,quality handmade  i'm very excited for this
B4nRgGnaknY,1093600,1099840,this is some dangerous  tray handling right here the double  decker xiaolongbao with the one tons on
B4nRgGnaknY,1099840,1105679,top and  it was so packed in that area that i  just escaped to the next aisle uh and
B4nRgGnaknY,1105679,1112640,found an empty table here with a nice  like open air section and again they  just make everything fresh on spot in
B4nRgGnaknY,1112640,1117760,that 10 by 10 square hocker stall that  they have so he put the plate on top of
B4nRgGnaknY,1117760,1124400,the xiaolongbao to keep it hot watch  this  all that steam just flows out
B4nRgGnaknY,1124400,1130400,i'm gonna set these aside and we have to  begin with that as much as i want to  begin with the spicy one tons you've got
B4nRgGnaknY,1130400,1136160,to begin with the xiao long bao because  those are hot and they need to be hot  when you're eating them so there's a lot  of strategies to eating xiaolongbao oh
B4nRgGnaknY,1136160,1141520,these are beautiful they're not too big  not too small but you can see how  pillowy that dough is how thin it is how
B4nRgGnaknY,1141520,1147840,neatly creased it is  you can see the soup sloshing around in  the bottom  and again there are
B4nRgGnaknY,1147840,1154000,a lot of strategies  to eating xiao long bao some people kind  of bite the top drink the soup then fill
B4nRgGnaknY,1154000,1160280,it up with the ginger um  yeah i think we'll try that strategy
B4nRgGnaknY,1164160,1170640,oh wow okay they're not scorching hot  probably because i took a bunch of  photos but that broth that comes out of
B4nRgGnaknY,1170640,1175760,them oh it's so porky  it has this natural sweetness to it
B4nRgGnaknY,1175760,1182559,oh that's just wonderful the wrapper is  slightly gooey  but not too thick uh just the perfect
B4nRgGnaknY,1182559,1190080,thinness it's delicate pretty crazy for  ginger so that's why i  loaded up my bowl with ginger
B4nRgGnaknY,1190080,1195840,okay in fact i'm gonna whoa  i gotta balance it with my fingers put
B4nRgGnaknY,1195840,1198880,some ginger into it
B4nRgGnaknY,1204080,1209840,oh wow that is unbelievable  oh man  so fresh so tasty
B4nRgGnaknY,1209840,1215760,with that ginger with that acidity of  the vinegar  that's so good
B4nRgGnaknY,1215760,1220960,and definitely i could pop the whole  shalom bao in my mouth they  are they won't scorch your tongue
B4nRgGnaknY,1220960,1226159,anymore  we gotta move into those noodles
B4nRgGnaknY,1226159,1232840,immediately i see the  the broth starting to fill into those  noodles so we gotta work faster this is  the spicy sichuan
B4nRgGnaknY,1232840,1239600,noodles hand  made noodles there's some peanuts in  here there's some herbs some coriander
B4nRgGnaknY,1239600,1246679,and some green onions that sauce looks  incredibly rich i think these are  handmade noodles as well
B4nRgGnaknY,1253760,1258960,well the peanuts in there  it's not  not really that spicy
B4nRgGnaknY,1258960,1264799,it's not tingly but it has an amazing  peanut flavor
B4nRgGnaknY,1271840,1278720,very tasty and then lastly not  forgetting about probably the thing i'm  most excited about the spicy one tons
B4nRgGnaknY,1278720,1287360,sichuan style he ladled on they steamed  the dumplings fresh ladled on some chili  oil some vinegar and then some chili
B4nRgGnaknY,1287360,1293360,and then this is i love the color i love  that swirl i love everything about it
B4nRgGnaknY,1297760,1305760,oh wow okay  that is as good as i was hoping for the  sponginess of the pork inside the
B4nRgGnaknY,1305760,1312240,lightness of the wrapper  that dressing which you can taste the  chili oil the vinegar to balance it
B4nRgGnaknY,1312240,1317760,extraordinary and i think yeah one thing  i can really say is that the  the one ton the
