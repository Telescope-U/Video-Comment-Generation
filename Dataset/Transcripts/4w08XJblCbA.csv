4w08XJblCbA,160,2240,why do you always use green buttercream
4w08XJblCbA,2240,3600,you wouldn't believe how many times i've
4w08XJblCbA,3600,5120,been asked this question and that's a
4w08XJblCbA,5120,6879,good question my cakes are shared by
4w08XJblCbA,6879,9120,random accounts all the time in fact i
4w08XJblCbA,9120,10800,just saw a tic tac post yesterday my
4w08XJblCbA,10800,13040,cake cutting videos that has 12 million
4w08XJblCbA,13040,14960,views and the person who posted it gave
4w08XJblCbA,14960,17199,me zero credit
4w08XJblCbA,17199,18960,so a few years ago i started filling my
4w08XJblCbA,18960,21119,cakes with green buttercream so when you
4w08XJblCbA,21119,23119,guys see a hyper realistic cake with
4w08XJblCbA,23119,24800,that green buttercream you know it's
4w08XJblCbA,24800,26640,likely a side surf cake and why did i
4w08XJblCbA,26640,29119,choose the color green because green is
4w08XJblCbA,29119,31119,an extremely rare color used to fill a
4w08XJblCbA,31119,35160,cake so it's perfect
