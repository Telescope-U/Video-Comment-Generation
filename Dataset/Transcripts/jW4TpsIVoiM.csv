jW4TpsIVoiM,23122,25725,"Oh, real food, how I've missed you."
jW4TpsIVoiM,27026,29862,"Whoa! Easy, guys. I don't want anyone to lose a finger."
jW4TpsIVoiM,29996,33132,"Abuelo, guess what time it is?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,33265,34734,My watch says eleven.
jW4TpsIVoiM,34868,37303,But my stomach and my nose...
jW4TpsIVoiM,37437,39805,say it's taco time.
jW4TpsIVoiM,39939,42242,"Ding, ding. We have a winner."
jW4TpsIVoiM,43443,45712,Whoa! I've never seen a red taco.

jW4TpsIVoiM,72838,75475,Tonight's dinner is leftover leftover hash.
jW4TpsIVoiM,76141,77843,"Mmm. Boy oh boy,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,77977,82348,that squid and sauerkraut sure has gotten pungent.
jW4TpsIVoiM,83349,85051,"No, no. Don't worry."
jW4TpsIVoiM,85184,86553,I got this.
jW4TpsIVoiM,89689,91023,[sighing]
jW4TpsIVoiM,91157,94894,Wow! The squid mixed with the liver and the lima beans.
jW4TpsIVoiM,95027,97096,"Separately, I was not a fan."
jW4TpsIVoiM,97230,98898,"Yes, you made that clear."
jW4TpsIVoiM,99032,102735,"But together, it's actually delicious!"

jW4TpsIVoiM,113412,114814,"If he makes the field goal,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,114947,117617,"Carl Casagrande will go down as the most daring,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,117750,119952,"most talented, most handsome..."

jW4TpsIVoiM,125191,126726,Huh?
jW4TpsIVoiM,127860,130229,Score!
jW4TpsIVoiM,130363,131531,[laughing]
jW4TpsIVoiM,132432,135034,My chilaquiles are for eating.
jW4TpsIVoiM,135267,136836,Wienerschnitzel.
jW4TpsIVoiM,136969,139805,"Not to brag, but this tastes exactly like last Wednesday's."
jW4TpsIVoiM,139939,142775,"Man, I have got this recipe dialed in!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,144410,145644,What are you doing?
jW4TpsIVoiM,145778,146512,Self hypnosis.
jW4TpsIVoiM,146645,148147,Maybe I can make myself believe
jW4TpsIVoiM,148281,150249,the Wienerschnitzel tastes like ice cream.
jW4TpsIVoiM,150382,151818,Ooh! I want ice cream! Move!
jW4TpsIVoiM,151951,153786,Come up with your own coping mechanism.
jW4TpsIVoiM,154954,157157,"No. No, no, no, no, no!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,158057,159325,Phew! That was close.
jW4TpsIVoiM,159458,161060,I almost had to order us pizza.
jW4TpsIVoiM,161193,162428,[laughing]
jW4TpsIVoiM,163162,164363,"Listen, Aubuela."
jW4TpsIVoiM,164496,165932,"- We're just friends. - Okay, okay."
jW4TpsIVoiM,166065,169034,"But Hector and I used to be just friends too,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,169168,171571,before we fell in love.
jW4TpsIVoiM,172839,175508,- Oops. - You can't use a plate?
jW4TpsIVoiM,175641,177343,The chip is the plate.
jW4TpsIVoiM,177477,179178,It's also a shovel.
jW4TpsIVoiM,179579,180946,"How's the turkey coming, Dad?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,181080,183716,"Ha! Turkeys are for amateurs, Lori Lou."
jW4TpsIVoiM,183850,185184,I'm making a turgoosen.
jW4TpsIVoiM,185318,187653,A pigeon stuffed inside a goose stuffed inside a turkey.
jW4TpsIVoiM,187786,190922,"Three times the bird, three times the deliciousness."
jW4TpsIVoiM,191056,191724,[squawking]
jW4TpsIVoiM,191857,193592,Triple homicide!
jW4TpsIVoiM,194093,196162,Ooh. Mashed potatoes.
jW4TpsIVoiM,196295,197463,Scram!
jW4TpsIVoiM,197596,199198,"Nice try, Sister."
jW4TpsIVoiM,199332,200700,"But as officers are the feast force,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,200833,203202,it's our job to protect this food till tomorrow.
jW4TpsIVoiM,203335,206205,- I was just... - We said scram!
jW4TpsIVoiM,206839,209275,Where were you two when Lin took my chicken stock?
jW4TpsIVoiM,209408,210977,[growling]
jW4TpsIVoiM,211110,215080,"Abuela, are these chilaquiles a little spicier than usual?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,215214,218183,It's just a little hot chile.
jW4TpsIVoiM,218317,220653,Ahh! Hot! Hot! Hot!
jW4TpsIVoiM,220787,223556,"Growing up, we always ate spicy food."
jW4TpsIVoiM,223689,225991,I'm trying to build your tolerance.
jW4TpsIVoiM,226125,226925,[laughing]
jW4TpsIVoiM,227059,228327,You guys are wimps.
jW4TpsIVoiM,228461,230996,Yeah... total wimps.
jW4TpsIVoiM,232198,236035,"Uh, maybe I'll play it safe and stick with the pancakes."
jW4TpsIVoiM,236168,237302,[screaming]
jW4TpsIVoiM,237436,239939,They're jalapeno pancakes.
jW4TpsIVoiM,240072,242742,Milk! Milk.
jW4TpsIVoiM,242875,244677,"Say leche, leche."

jW4TpsIVoiM,268067,269401,"What are you making, Dad?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,269535,270836,"I'm not really sure,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,270969,274807,but let's just call it Casa Loud Casserole.
jW4TpsIVoiM,274940,277777,Ooh! I have the perfect outfit for that!
jW4TpsIVoiM,280079,281714,"Honey, that was delicious."

jW4TpsIVoiM,284684,286686,Thank you. I think you kids were right.

jW4TpsIVoiM,289088,290456,- Really? - Yep.
jW4TpsIVoiM,290589,292291,"In fact, I'm going to the store right now"
jW4TpsIVoiM,292425,294626,to get some new Lynngredients.

jW4TpsIVoiM,297229,299298,I didn't know you were home.
jW4TpsIVoiM,299431,300900,Do I smell my...
jW4TpsIVoiM,301033,304403,"My Bunuelos? Why, yes."
jW4TpsIVoiM,304536,306705,They're my all time favorite!
jW4TpsIVoiM,306838,309441,They are? I didn't remember.
jW4TpsIVoiM,309574,312111,"Please, have one."
jW4TpsIVoiM,312244,313813,Wait. Didn't you tell me before?
jW4TpsIVoiM,313946,315681,I wasn't allowed to taste anything.
jW4TpsIVoiM,315814,317817,Nonsense. I never said that.
jW4TpsIVoiM,317950,322088,It's been five long years since I've had the chance to cook
jW4TpsIVoiM,322221,323855,a Thanksgiving meal for you.

jW4TpsIVoiM,336201,337802,Shh shh. Keep eating.
jW4TpsIVoiM,338370,339738,You kids must be famished.

jW4TpsIVoiM,342175,344543,- Burgers and cheese! - Blood oranges.
jW4TpsIVoiM,344677,346746,"No, I mean actual grubs."

jW4TpsIVoiM,360926,364497,"Hey, these are great with a little of this BO water."
jW4TpsIVoiM,365598,368065,I'll have to use all the remedios
jW4TpsIVoiM,368200,370403,in my good luck arsenal.
jW4TpsIVoiM,380345,381480,[screaming]
jW4TpsIVoiM,381614,383716,We'll start with a good luck smoothie
jW4TpsIVoiM,383849,386485,packed with herbs like artemisia.
jW4TpsIVoiM,386619,388720,Doesn't that sound delicious?
jW4TpsIVoiM,389655,394427,"It may sound delicious, but it tastes like a dirty pata!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,394560,395794,[burping]
jW4TpsIVoiM,397329,399365,"Alright! Get ready to feast, Fam!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,399966,402835,Not so fast! I meant feast your eyes.

jW4TpsIVoiM,411376,412812,I'm starting over.
jW4TpsIVoiM,414780,417583,Needs just a pinch of cinnamon.
jW4TpsIVoiM,418217,420486,Phase one. Code salty.
jW4TpsIVoiM,423589,426391,Mmm. That's delicious.
jW4TpsIVoiM,426525,428995,I'll have to get your recipe.
jW4TpsIVoiM,434733,437369,Salty pancakes? That's different.
jW4TpsIVoiM,437502,438738,Salty?
jW4TpsIVoiM,440573,444843,Salados! Oh no. Saltiness is a sign of bad luck.
jW4TpsIVoiM,445444,447412,"Ooh! More for me, then."
jW4TpsIVoiM,447813,449882,Do you guys smell something nasty?
jW4TpsIVoiM,450016,452651,"Hey, hope you're hungry, Gang."
jW4TpsIVoiM,452785,455955,I finally perfected my new cabbage casserole.
jW4TpsIVoiM,460359,462861,"Wow, Daddy. Smells great!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,462995,464695,"Some of your best work, honey."
jW4TpsIVoiM,464830,466832,Wait! I forgot the fish sauce!
jW4TpsIVoiM,466966,469035,It really brings out the sulfur notes.
jW4TpsIVoiM,469168,470436,[laughing]
jW4TpsIVoiM,470569,472138,"Quick, ditch it before we have to eat the fish sauce!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,479811,481447,The lies continue.
jW4TpsIVoiM,481780,483115,This looks delicious.
jW4TpsIVoiM,483249,486218,I'm starving and everything is sore.
jW4TpsIVoiM,486919,488153,What you put in your body
jW4TpsIVoiM,488287,490621,the night before a big test is crucial.

jW4TpsIVoiM,493025,493492,[gasping]
jW4TpsIVoiM,493625,494426,"dairy,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,494559,496061,Not the cheese!
jW4TpsIVoiM,496195,498331,"and starches, can radically improve your test scores."
jW4TpsIVoiM,498464,501065,[grunting]
jW4TpsIVoiM,501199,504036,- Aw. - Whoopsie! Forgot the beans.

jW4TpsIVoiM,508740,510176,Blech! Hey!
jW4TpsIVoiM,510309,513378,"You lost your torta privileges, mister!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,513645,515047,Dashing to the stove.
jW4TpsIVoiM,515180,517583,"Hey, son, you're just in time to try the crown jewel"
jW4TpsIVoiM,517716,519451,of old Dad's Christmas Eve feast!

jW4TpsIVoiM,531096,532097,Number five!
jW4TpsIVoiM,532230,533865,Oh! I love the 12 puns of Christmas.
jW4TpsIVoiM,533999,535301,"Luan, you want to try my pudding?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,535434,538303,"Sorry, Dad. Yule have to ask someone else."
jW4TpsIVoiM,538437,540406,Get it? Yule! That's six!
jW4TpsIVoiM,540539,542241,I just sleigh myself!
jW4TpsIVoiM,542374,543442,Ooh! Seven!
jW4TpsIVoiM,543575,545444,[laughing]
jW4TpsIVoiM,545577,546846,"Hey, Abuela?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,546979,549281,Is it okay if my friend joins us for lunch?
jW4TpsIVoiM,549748,552118,"Of course, Mijita, all are welcome."
jW4TpsIVoiM,552251,553118,[gasping]
jW4TpsIVoiM,553251,554652,Alisa!
jW4TpsIVoiM,554787,556455,"Hola, Casagrandes family!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,556588,558891,It's so great to see you again.
jW4TpsIVoiM,559024,562261,"I'm sorry, but is that... tostadas de ceviche?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,562394,567266,"You bet, Mija! Ven aquí! Let me get you a little serving."
jW4TpsIVoiM,568400,569335,[gasping]

jW4TpsIVoiM,574540,575207,[gasping]
jW4TpsIVoiM,575341,576641,So good.
jW4TpsIVoiM,576775,578377,This part of helping Dad get ready
jW4TpsIVoiM,578510,579878,was tasting the sample menu.
jW4TpsIVoiM,580012,581847,"Now, everyone take a comment card"
jW4TpsIVoiM,581980,585350,"and rate the dishes based on presentation, texture,"

jW4TpsIVoiM,586685,587887,Ha! Uh!
jW4TpsIVoiM,588020,590155,Slow down! I need detailed feedback!
jW4TpsIVoiM,590522,592324,Ugh. I just ate my comment card.
jW4TpsIVoiM,592457,595326,"I wasn't sure if you wanted breakfast or lunch,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,595460,596462,so I made both.
jW4TpsIVoiM,596595,597529,I could eat both.
jW4TpsIVoiM,597662,600299,"Te adora, mijito!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,602935,607005,"Gotcha, Lincoln! Let's go! Time to walk the plank!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,607138,610743,"Okay, I respect the laws of the sea, but can I eat first?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,610976,614714,"Sure, I'm a pirate, but I'm fair."
jW4TpsIVoiM,616181,620286,"- Hey, honey. - Dad! What are you doing here?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,620419,623288,- I brought lunch! - But I already have lunch.
jW4TpsIVoiM,623422,625958,Oh! You can be eating basic PB and J's!

jW4TpsIVoiM,627860,629828,you need to work on refining your palate.
jW4TpsIVoiM,629962,632264,"Okay. I got Linburger cheese,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,632397,633565,Blech!
jW4TpsIVoiM,633699,636068,"a main course of Beef Bourguignon,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,636969,638370,"and don't worry, I brought dessert."
jW4TpsIVoiM,638504,639504,It's an oldie but a goody.
jW4TpsIVoiM,639638,641140,It's baked Alaska!
jW4TpsIVoiM,641273,642375,Well almost.
jW4TpsIVoiM,642508,643909,[laughing]
jW4TpsIVoiM,644643,647947,[squealing]
jW4TpsIVoiM,651316,652850,Mija!
jW4TpsIVoiM,653552,656589,"Hey, Abuela, what's going on?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,656722,658923,I just whipped up some Queso Fundido
jW4TpsIVoiM,659057,661160,"for you, and your bestie."
jW4TpsIVoiM,661293,662161,"Eat, eat."
jW4TpsIVoiM,662294,664530,"Aw, thanks, that sounds delicious"
jW4TpsIVoiM,664663,666064,but we're still pretty full
jW4TpsIVoiM,666197,668100,from the taquitos you made us twenty minutes ago.
jW4TpsIVoiM,668234,670269,"Of course, what am I thinking?"
jW4TpsIVoiM,670402,672071,I'll go make dessert.
jW4TpsIVoiM,682181,684583,"Well, Lynn, I'm going to give it to you straight."
jW4TpsIVoiM,684716,689854,This is... one of... the best meals I've ever eaten!
jW4TpsIVoiM,689988,691389,I knew it was a dumb idea.
jW4TpsIVoiM,691523,694025,I shoulda never served it! I... um... wait. What?
jW4TpsIVoiM,694159,695727,"I've been all over the world,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,695861,698297,and every chef serves me the same thing.
jW4TpsIVoiM,698430,700799,"Caviar, pâté, uni."
jW4TpsIVoiM,700932,703068,It's boring and uninspired.
jW4TpsIVoiM,703202,705037,"Do you know at the last place I ate,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,705170,708373,the chef served me 'Air in a Jar'?
jW4TpsIVoiM,708506,709975,What a bozo!
jW4TpsIVoiM,710409,714113,"But your food is classic, comforting and delicious."
jW4TpsIVoiM,714246,716081,"And when you travel as much as I do,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,716215,719551,there's nothing better than food that tastes like home.
jW4TpsIVoiM,720386,723588,Ooh! I wanna be in the Lynn loud business!
jW4TpsIVoiM,723722,725023,Wow!
jW4TpsIVoiM,725156,727727,"Thank you, Tim. I don't know what to say!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,728260,729395,I don't do hugs.
jW4TpsIVoiM,731830,733132,Ooh.
jW4TpsIVoiM,733265,736434,"I hope you enjoy my caldo de siete mares,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,736568,739105,Mr. Famous Food Critic.
jW4TpsIVoiM,749548,750982,Wow!
jW4TpsIVoiM,751116,753085,"This is the best siete mares caldo, I've ever had,"
jW4TpsIVoiM,753218,755287,"there's no contest, Mrs. Casagrande."
jW4TpsIVoiM,755421,758390,You are officially the city's best home cook!
jW4TpsIVoiM,758523,759758,[squealing]
jW4TpsIVoiM,759892,763328,"Yes! I'm so happy for you, Abuela!"
jW4TpsIVoiM,763461,765164,"Thank you, Mija."
