8duNwrqZGd4,139760,145680,low and oxygen from your whole body  and sends it to your lungs through your
8duNwrqZGd4,145680,152640,pulmonary artery the lungs fill blood  with oxygen that your left atrium
8duNwrqZGd4,152640,158959,receives and flows through the left  ventricle to the aortic arteries i'm
8duNwrqZGd4,158959,164319,your heart  i live inside of your chest i'm above

8duNwrqZGd4,185840,193840,gallons of blood through your body  there is about 60 000 miles of vessels
8duNwrqZGd4,193840,201200,in your  circulatory system i always keep them  full i have four valves that open and
8duNwrqZGd4,201200,207920,close that control the blood through me  the tricuspid pulmonic mitral and aortic
8duNwrqZGd4,207920,214319,valves you see on your  heart i live inside of your chest i'm

8duNwrqZGd4,227920,237680,of me please  [Music]
8duNwrqZGd4,237680,244799,i'm called the fingernail here to hammer  away all the facts and knowledge of my
8duNwrqZGd4,244799,250959,anatomy your fingernails are like a  flattened form of claw made up of
8duNwrqZGd4,250959,256560,keratin please don't bite me with your  jaw let's look at what your fingernails
8duNwrqZGd4,256560,262000,are made of the answer is a protein  named carrot in the word you see above
8duNwrqZGd4,262000,268000,but how does this protein called keratin  grow let's take a look at this finger so
8duNwrqZGd4,268000,273280,you can learn what i know here's a  finger without a nail i'll show you how
8duNwrqZGd4,273280,278479,it grows this is the top layer of the  skin called the epidermis shown cells
8duNwrqZGd4,278479,285440,move outward to your epidermis creating  skin but when new cells move to your  nail root they push old cells out from
8duNwrqZGd4,285440,291199,within these cells are called  keratinocytes shown here in this area
8duNwrqZGd4,291199,296479,called the matrix that did just appear  where this edge called the nail root
8duNwrqZGd4,296479,303039,does begin is where the cells called  keratinocytes produce keratin keratin
8duNwrqZGd4,303039,308800,are the dead keratinocyte cells that  were pushed out by the new forming cells
8duNwrqZGd4,308800,315680,i  your fingernails and toenails are packed  with keratin which are dead keratinocyte
8duNwrqZGd4,315680,321280,cells that grow from within keratin is  tough and makes your nails real hard you
8duNwrqZGd4,321280,328560,agree so you can scratch and itch and  protect your toes and fingers you see  did you know that clawsnails whose horns
8duNwrqZGd4,328560,334320,hair and feathers are also made of  keratin to make life better here's the
8duNwrqZGd4,334320,339440,anatomy of the fingertip and the parts  that do show play an important part in
8duNwrqZGd4,339440,346160,nail group to make them strong and grow  this is the nail matrix  and the root of the nail
8duNwrqZGd4,346160,353199,the proximal nail full to the cuticle i  hail  here is the body and the free edge of
8duNwrqZGd4,353199,358560,the nail which sits on the nail bed  without these things your nail would  fail
8duNwrqZGd4,358560,366000,all of these parts sit on the distal  phalanges those are the bones at the  tips of the fingers and toes under me
8duNwrqZGd4,366000,372720,please keep your toes and finger nails  dry healthy and clean this keeps  bacteria from growing and they split
8duNwrqZGd4,372720,378720,nail on me trimming your nails can keep  them free of disease make sure you use

8duNwrqZGd4,384479,392240,hammer away all the facts and knowledge  of my anatomy your fingernails are like
8duNwrqZGd4,392240,397440,a flattened form of claw made up of  keratin please don't bite me with your
8duNwrqZGd4,397440,405520,jaw  [Music]  i am a human hair on your body i declare
8duNwrqZGd4,405520,410560,i can tell you why i'm here this  knowledge i will share i'm a protein
8duNwrqZGd4,410560,416800,filament a follicle is where i grow  let's learn all about me you may cut me
8duNwrqZGd4,416800,424160,but don't pull  i grow all over your body and wouldn't  you know i'm mostly located on your head
8duNwrqZGd4,424160,430000,and here's why i grow i'm used as a  source of insulation on top of your head
8duNwrqZGd4,430000,437680,i'm a heat source when you're cold and  keep you cool when you sweat i protect  you from ultraviolet rays that come from
8duNwrqZGd4,437680,443120,the sun let's take a look at the parts  of me and where i come from here are
8duNwrqZGd4,443120,450960,parts of the hair follicle that help  your hair grow pay attention these are  important parts that you should know
8duNwrqZGd4,450960,456479,this is the dermal papilla attached to  the blood vessels the hair bulb in the
8duNwrqZGd4,456479,462800,follicle and the hair as shown the  sebaceous gland secretes lubricating oil
8duNwrqZGd4,462800,470000,you know called sebum into the hair  follicles to lubricate skin and hair in  full then you see the nerve
8duNwrqZGd4,470000,476000,and you see the hair shaft erector peely  muscle cause a hair to stand on end on
8duNwrqZGd4,476000,481520,their path a hair follicles job is to  anchor each hair to the skin a hair is
8duNwrqZGd4,481520,487280,made up of tough protein called keratin  here are the parts of the shaft of hair
8duNwrqZGd4,487280,492639,that do show the outer part you see is  called the cuticle
8duNwrqZGd4,492639,498520,here's the cortex in which holds these  fibers i'm sure here's a macro fibril in
8duNwrqZGd4,498520,504720,microfibril protein fiber structure in  the centers the medulla in large thick
8duNwrqZGd4,504720,509840,hairs let's make things much more  interesting to show i care the four
8duNwrqZGd4,509840,516800,stages of hair growth is what we'll look  at please pay close attention and take
8duNwrqZGd4,516800,522240,off your hat and a gin is the first  phase in the hair cycle growth when
8duNwrqZGd4,522240,528480,defined it means the state in which your  hair grows on average in this stage your
8duNwrqZGd4,528480,535519,hair does grow one centimeter a month it  varies by genetics though the cells in
8duNwrqZGd4,535519,540959,the root of the hair divide at a rapid  rate this lasts from two to seven years
8duNwrqZGd4,540959,546959,for your hair to generate the catagen  stage begins when the antigen stage ends
8duNwrqZGd4,546959,552000,when the lower portion of the hair  follicle regresses and hair growth ends
8duNwrqZGd4,552000,559279,follicle stops producing the fiber  shrinking dramatically ending this  here's growth this stage lasts about two
8duNwrqZGd4,559279,564399,weeks then the telogen phase begins when  detached hair does rest this lasts for
8duNwrqZGd4,564399,569680,about three months now on to the next  phase at best the oxygen stages when the
8duNwrqZGd4,569680,574880,hairs pushed from the hair follicle and  is shed from the body starting the
8duNwrqZGd4,574880,580399,anagen stage again take care and wash  your hair every two to three days please
8duNwrqZGd4,580399,589200,for proper regulation of natural hair  oils on me  i am a human hair on your body i declare

8duNwrqZGd4,620079,625519,we'll see  in our voyage we will learn about  biology
8duNwrqZGd4,625519,632640,i'm a cell  your body's made up of me there's more  than 200 different types of cells in the
8duNwrqZGd4,632640,638320,human body  atoms and molecules are what created me
8duNwrqZGd4,638320,645680,then i made all the systems you're about  to hear and see  there's the nervous system it has an
8duNwrqZGd4,645680,652000,important job too it sends signals from  into the brain for all that you do
8duNwrqZGd4,652000,657680,the circulatory system is where all your  blood flows it carries oxygen and
8duNwrqZGd4,657680,663680,nutrients to where it should go  the respiratory system is what you used
8duNwrqZGd4,663680,669680,to breathe it carries oxygen to all the  cells that your body needs come take a

8duNwrqZGd4,1324320,1329679,is your second segment that's where most  of your foods nutrients is absorbed in
8duNwrqZGd4,1329679,1334880,its descent  your jejunum gets the nutrients it needs
8duNwrqZGd4,1334880,1340880,the chimes pass through the helium which  concludes the parts of three the ilium
8duNwrqZGd4,1340880,1347200,absorbs the remaining nutrients before  beginning the journey into your large

8duNwrqZGd4,1375200,1382400,we are your eyes  we are your eyes
8duNwrqZGd4,1383200,1390240,our job's to see the world around you  your most important sensory organ times
8duNwrqZGd4,1390240,1396000,two  let's take a look into your eye to see  of what they are comprised then we'll
8duNwrqZGd4,1396000,1401679,learn about the roles that they do play  the crystal clear transparent layer is
8duNwrqZGd4,1401679,1407200,called the cornea it lets us see the  colored iris every day
8duNwrqZGd4,1407200,1413520,the black center in your iris is called  your pupil which brings us to the focus
8duNwrqZGd4,1413520,1421200,of your  lens then we travel through your  vitreous humor it's a clear jelly like
8duNwrqZGd4,1421200,1427440,tissue my friends  the retina makes up about 65
8duNwrqZGd4,1427440,1434240,of the inside of your eye you should  know  your optic nerve can be found at the
8duNwrqZGd4,1434240,1442720,back of your eye onto the brain is where  your nerve will go  we are your eyes
8duNwrqZGd4,1442720,1451200,we are your eyes  [Music]  our job's to see the world around you
8duNwrqZGd4,1451200,1457840,your most important sensory organ times  too  some cool facts about your eyes they're
8duNwrqZGd4,1457840,1463679,about the same size as when you're born  to when you're fully grown
8duNwrqZGd4,1463679,1468960,your retina it has millions of  photoreceptors but you only have two
8duNwrqZGd4,1468960,1474000,types called rods and cones  the rods are way more sensitive but
8duNwrqZGd4,1474000,1479679,cannot tell colors and are mostly used  when light is really low
8duNwrqZGd4,1479679,1485679,your cones are mostly active in a higher  light and can recognize all colors now
8duNwrqZGd4,1485679,1492799,you know  your eyes each have six muscles to help  move them around the superior and
8duNwrqZGd4,1492799,1498720,inferior oblique  then the medial and lateral rectus and
8duNwrqZGd4,1498720,1506720,superior and inferior rectus are not  weak  we are your eyes
8duNwrqZGd4,1506720,1515200,we are your eyes  [Music]  our jobs to see the world around you
8duNwrqZGd4,1515200,1521679,your most important sensory organ times  do  when the light enters your eyes through
8duNwrqZGd4,1521679,1527440,the cornea it flies then your iris  decides what it should do
8duNwrqZGd4,1527440,1532480,if the light is really bright the iris  closes real tight but if the light is
8duNwrqZGd4,1532480,1538240,dim it opens wide for you  the iris regulates the pupils light
8duNwrqZGd4,1538240,1545440,intakes so you can see in day and also  in low light  your lens stretches and retracts to
8duNwrqZGd4,1545440,1551440,focus what you're looking at so you can  clearly see the objects around you
8duNwrqZGd4,1551440,1559200,then the retinas rods and cones take the  light impulse as shown and sends it  through the optic nerve to the brain
8duNwrqZGd4,1559200,1564480,the brain takes all that information and  makes the final picture so take care of
8duNwrqZGd4,1564480,1570720,your eyes please don't let them strain  we are your eyes
8duNwrqZGd4,1570720,1579200,we are your eyes  [Music]  our job's to see the world around you
8duNwrqZGd4,1579200,1594079,your most important sensory organ times  do  [Music]
8duNwrqZGd4,1594480,1599039,we're here to show you how
8duNwrqZGd4,1602710,1609919,[Music]  let's take a look at your ears and what
8duNwrqZGd4,1609919,1615200,they're made of there's three parts of  the human ear they are all of the above
8duNwrqZGd4,1615200,1621440,first we have the outer ear it consists  of two parts the pinna and the ear canal
8duNwrqZGd4,1621440,1627200,they're both the work of art onto the  middle ear and it's parts of three the
8duNwrqZGd4,1627200,1635200,eardrum the ossicles and the cavity  the oval window and the semicircle ducts
8duNwrqZGd4,1635200,1640720,cochlea and auditory tubes are the inner  ear parts
8duNwrqZGd4,1640720,1646480,listen up  we're your ears we're here to show you
8duNwrqZGd4,1646480,1655840,how we function we hope you learn a lot  and remember what you hear
8duNwrqZGd4,1656880,1662240,the smallest bones in your body are from  the ossicles group they are the hammer
8duNwrqZGd4,1662240,1668240,anvil and stir up we'll get to what they  do  the semi-circle canals are made up of
8duNwrqZGd4,1668240,1673440,three tubes filled with liquid endolymph  they look just like little loops when
8duNwrqZGd4,1673440,1678640,your head is in motion the liquid  endolymph moves triggering the little
8duNwrqZGd4,1678640,1684640,hairs called cilia that live in you the  celia sends these motion signals to your
8duNwrqZGd4,1684640,1690720,brain then your brain knows how to  balance you so you don't get a sprain
8duNwrqZGd4,1690720,1696480,listen up  we're your ears we're here to show you
8duNwrqZGd4,1696480,1705759,how we function we hope you learn a lot  and remember what you hear
8duNwrqZGd4,1707360,1715200,when sound waves are made the pinner  gathers them up and sends them through  the ear canal to the eardrums little cup
8duNwrqZGd4,1715200,1721919,then your eardrum vibrates and it  strikes the hammer bone which moves the  anvil and the stirrup which makes all
8duNwrqZGd4,1721919,1727200,that sound grow the stirrup vibrates the  liquid that fills your cochlea the
8duNwrqZGd4,1727200,1733039,liquid moves all sorts of fibers which  vibrates more cilia that cilia creates
8duNwrqZGd4,1733039,1738159,electric impulses that shoot through the  cochlear nerve to the brain aren't your
8duNwrqZGd4,1738159,1745200,ears a hoop then the brain takes all  that info and tells you what you heard  so please take care of your two ears so
8duNwrqZGd4,1745200,1750720,you can listen to our words  listen up
8duNwrqZGd4,1750720,1756399,wear your ears  we're here to show you how we function
8duNwrqZGd4,1756399,1764440,we hope you learn a lot and remember  what you hear
8duNwrqZGd4,1770260,1775600,[Music]  can you smell
8duNwrqZGd4,1775600,1782640,what's in the air  that's a smell of knowledge listen to  your nose and let me share let's start
8duNwrqZGd4,1782640,1788880,with the parts of the nose that you can  see  the nasion root and bridge are the first
8duNwrqZGd4,1788880,1795840,parts of three  then the alloy apex nostril and  columella are parts of your nose whether
8duNwrqZGd4,1795840,1802320,you're a girl or a fella now let's move  on to the inner parts of your nose the
8duNwrqZGd4,1802320,1808320,nasal bone supports the upper bridge now  you know the upper lateral cartilage
8duNwrqZGd4,1808320,1813360,forms your side walls the septal  cartilage runs down the center and it's
8duNwrqZGd4,1813360,1819840,tall the minor aller cartilage is not  very big the major aller cartilage has
8duNwrqZGd4,1819840,1827600,two parts seen in this ear fig the  accessory nasal cartilage sits on the  side knows cartilage is flexible
8duNwrqZGd4,1827600,1833840,connective tissue i've exposed can you  smell  what's in the air
8duNwrqZGd4,1833840,1840880,that's a smell of knowledge listen to  your nose and let me share the first of  your five senses that you use when
8duNwrqZGd4,1840880,1846320,you're a baby is your sense of smell it  is important to use this sense daily
8duNwrqZGd4,1846320,1851840,odor molecules or sniff from the air  into your nose most of the nasal cavity
8duNwrqZGd4,1851840,1857279,filters air will it does flow your  olfactory epithelium's a little patch of
8duNwrqZGd4,1857279,1862840,skin its job is very large it detects  older molecules brought in when odor
8duNwrqZGd4,1862840,1868320,molecules reach the back of your nose  they get stuck to a layer of mucus where
8duNwrqZGd4,1868320,1873840,they start to dissolve that's where they  bind to the olfactory receptor cells
8duNwrqZGd4,1873840,1881039,then the signals made and sent through  the olfactory tracked well your brain  receives the info and deciphers these
8duNwrqZGd4,1881039,1886320,signals and tells your body whether it  is good or whether it should go can you
8duNwrqZGd4,1886320,1892080,smell  what's in the air  that's a smell of knowledge listen to
8duNwrqZGd4,1892080,1903279,your nose and let me share  [Music]
8duNwrqZGd4,1903279,1909120,hello i'm your skeleton as you can  plainly see here's some of the 206 bones
8duNwrqZGd4,1909120,1915519,in the human body and as a baby you  start out with about 300 different bones
8duNwrqZGd4,1915519,1921840,that's a lot considering many fuse when  you are grown 206 bones is what you have
8duNwrqZGd4,1921840,1927200,as in a towel due to all the fusion your  bumps do this is the result
8duNwrqZGd4,1927200,1935200,ligaments hold the ends of your bones  together this is true and muscles attach  the bone with tendons connective tissue
8duNwrqZGd4,1935200,1942000,tendons and ligaments connect to bones  on either side of a joint  holding bones together tightly that is
8duNwrqZGd4,1942000,1947919,the point  bone marrow's a soft and spongy tissue  found inside some bones bone marrow
8duNwrqZGd4,1947919,1953039,stroma stem cells are called mess and  camel mess and camel stencils are two
8duNwrqZGd4,1953039,1959279,colors yellow and red the yellow color  produces fat bone in your cartilage
8duNwrqZGd4,1959279,1964559,the red color produces white and red  blood cells it also makes the platelets
8duNwrqZGd4,1964559,1970000,that cause clotting to stop bleeding  well hello i'm your skeleton as you can
8duNwrqZGd4,1970000,1976240,plainly see here's some of the 206 bones  in the human body let's focus on some of
8duNwrqZGd4,1976240,1981519,the major bones in the human body we'll  start at the top of the cranium which is
8duNwrqZGd4,1981519,1989039,called your skull you see then we'll  move down to the mandible it helps you  chew your food onto the clavicle also
8duNwrqZGd4,1989039,1996240,called the collar bone on you  here we have the sternum which connects  all your ribs here's the pelvis it's
8duNwrqZGd4,1996240,2003519,your midsection which gives you your  hips connected to your pelvis is the  biggest bone in the body it's called the
8duNwrqZGd4,2003519,2009279,femur and it is also the strongest bone  you'll see right below it are the tibia
8duNwrqZGd4,2009279,2015200,and fibula on you they work together to  hold your feet on your body this is true
8duNwrqZGd4,2015200,2020880,let's not forget the humerus bone on the  upper arm it's attached to the radius
8duNwrqZGd4,2020880,2027039,and all of that form your forearm your  hand is made up of about 27 bones we'll
8duNwrqZGd4,2027039,2032480,focus on those in another one of my  songs catchy tones hello i'm your
8duNwrqZGd4,2032480,2039200,skeleton as you can plainly see here's  some of the 206 bones in the human body
8duNwrqZGd4,2039200,2044240,let's move to the posterior or the back  side of you first thing you'll notice is
8duNwrqZGd4,2044240,2050000,the spinal column i'll break that down  too  the cervical vertebrae also known as
8duNwrqZGd4,2050000,2055520,your neck is made up of seven bones to  help keep your head in check then the
8duNwrqZGd4,2055520,2063520,thoracic vertebrae is made up of twelve  bones it's the longest stretch of your  spinal column that is shown
8duNwrqZGd4,2063520,2069200,then there's a lumbar vertebrae on your  lower back it's an arch and a very
8duNwrqZGd4,2069200,2075118,important bony stack onto your sacrum  it's a touch or your pelvis then the
8duNwrqZGd4,2075118,2080240,spine ends with the fusion of bones  called the coccyx please take care of
8duNwrqZGd4,2080240,2087280,your bones and keep them healthy and  strong they give you structure in your  life to help you live really long
8duNwrqZGd4,2087280,2093118,hello i'm your skeleton as you can  plainly see here's some of the 206 bones
8duNwrqZGd4,2093118,2099669,in the human body  [Music]
8duNwrqZGd4,2100240,2106240,i am your skin  made of three layers within i'm the
8duNwrqZGd4,2106240,2113599,largest organ of the body but up to four  millimeters thin on your skin
8duNwrqZGd4,2113599,2119680,protected by keratin i have control your  core temperature and my colors caused by
8duNwrqZGd4,2119680,2127200,the pigment melanin let's take a look at  the skin and the three layers within
8duNwrqZGd4,2127200,2132560,with this picture drawn to study the  anatomy so let's begin
8duNwrqZGd4,2132560,2138520,the first layer you see is the outer  skin that's on me it's called the
8duNwrqZGd4,2138520,2146240,epidermis which is the skin surface  everywhere that i be  the second layer shown here is called
8duNwrqZGd4,2146240,2152480,the dermis so we're clear it's a thick  layer of living tissue full of cool
8duNwrqZGd4,2152480,2158480,stuff i'll share the third layer's the  hypodermis the innermost and thickest
8duNwrqZGd4,2158480,2165119,skin  it's a fat insulation and padding for  your body to keep the heat in i am your
8duNwrqZGd4,2165119,2170240,skin  made up three layers within i'm the
8duNwrqZGd4,2170240,2177599,largest organ of the body but up to four  millimeters thin on your skin
8duNwrqZGd4,2177599,2183680,protected by keratin i have control your  core temperature and my colors caused by
8duNwrqZGd4,2183680,2189280,the pigment melon and let's take a  deeper look at the layers i just
8duNwrqZGd4,2189280,2195200,introduced to you and find out the  important jobs they play and all that
8duNwrqZGd4,2195200,2203200,they do the epidermis is the first layer  and is waterproof as well mostly made up
8duNwrqZGd4,2203200,2209200,of squamous cells which are flat and  skin like isn't that swell under that we
8duNwrqZGd4,2209200,2214800,have these round cells called the basal  cells then melanocytes that produce
8duNwrqZGd4,2214800,2221920,melanin which determines the color of  your skin  then there is the dermis the lower inner
8duNwrqZGd4,2221920,2227520,layer of skin it plays in an important  role of the three layers we discuss
8duNwrqZGd4,2227520,2234880,within it contains blood and lymph  vessels that carry cells that fight  infection and disease and glands that
8duNwrqZGd4,2234880,2243119,produce sweat which help regulate the  body temperature that you need the pores  also secrete sebum oil so your skin does
8duNwrqZGd4,2243119,2248800,not dry out and hair follicles that make  and hold your hair what you need without
8duNwrqZGd4,2248800,2255520,a doubt i am your skin  made of three layers within i'm the
8duNwrqZGd4,2255520,2262880,largest organ of the body but up to four  millimeters thin on your skin
8duNwrqZGd4,2262880,2269040,protected by keratin i help control your  core temperature and my colors caused by
8duNwrqZGd4,2269040,2275760,the pigment melanin this is hypodermis  which connects your skin to muscle and
8duNwrqZGd4,2275760,2281280,organs its main functions to store fat  and protect you from an impact on your
8duNwrqZGd4,2281280,2288560,skin  the integumentary system is what i'm  part of as your skin which includes skin
8duNwrqZGd4,2288560,2293839,hair nails and echocrine glands from the  body you live in please take care of
8duNwrqZGd4,2293839,2299200,your skin  and of your body every day you only have
8duNwrqZGd4,2299200,2305520,one body so keep it systems healthy i am  your skin
8duNwrqZGd4,2305520,2312240,made of three layers within i'm the  largest organ of the body but up to four
8duNwrqZGd4,2312240,2319839,millimeters thin on your skin  protected by keratin i have control your
8duNwrqZGd4,2319839,2327940,core temperature and my colors caused by  the pigment melanin  [Music]
