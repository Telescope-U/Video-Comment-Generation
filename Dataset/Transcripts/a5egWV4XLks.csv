a5egWV4XLks,3040,6880,i'm tiger woods and this is my game
a5egWV4XLks,7060,10520,[Music]
a5egWV4XLks,11840,13840,this is a golf lesson none of you had
a5egWV4XLks,13840,16840,before
a5egWV4XLks,27450,34480,[Music]
a5egWV4XLks,34480,35920,technology has certainly leveled the
a5egWV4XLks,35920,38320,playing field because
a5egWV4XLks,38320,40000,you don't always have to hit the ball in
a5egWV4XLks,40000,41440,middle of face
a5egWV4XLks,41440,43120,time and time again
a5egWV4XLks,43120,45280,and quite frankly the bosses don't curve
a5egWV4XLks,45280,46559,as much
a5egWV4XLks,46559,49039,and so that's narrowed the field that's
a5egWV4XLks,49039,51440,brought all of us closer together
a5egWV4XLks,51440,53600,but
a5egWV4XLks,54879,57039,saying that
a5egWV4XLks,57039,58960,that also puts
a5egWV4XLks,58960,61680,an added importance of being
a5egWV4XLks,61680,64320,how can you figure out your own edge
a5egWV4XLks,64320,66000,where are you going to find that you
a5egWV4XLks,66000,68479,know some some guys have a unique talent
a5egWV4XLks,68479,69439,of
a5egWV4XLks,69439,71840,hitting the ball more solid than others
a5egWV4XLks,71840,72720,some
a5egWV4XLks,72720,75040,are faster than others
a5egWV4XLks,75040,76960,where's your edge going to be
a5egWV4XLks,76960,78400,you know that's where you need to find
a5egWV4XLks,78400,80799,it and it's just not as apparent as it
a5egWV4XLks,80799,83040,used to be
a5egWV4XLks,83040,84159,well
a5egWV4XLks,84159,87280,there's trade-offs right um if you want
a5egWV4XLks,87280,88880,a little bit more spin
a5egWV4XLks,88880,89759,then
a5egWV4XLks,89759,91439,you're not going to have the distance
a5egWV4XLks,91439,93200,that you could get with you know a
a5egWV4XLks,93200,95200,harder golf ball
a5egWV4XLks,95200,96960,for me i've
a5egWV4XLks,96960,99040,i've always been one that has been able
a5egWV4XLks,99040,101119,to control my spin
a5egWV4XLks,101119,102960,and take spin off
a5egWV4XLks,102960,104320,i've struggled when i've had to put spin
a5egWV4XLks,104320,105600,on a golf ball
a5egWV4XLks,105600,106560,and so
a5egWV4XLks,106560,109360,give me the spin i'll take it off
a5egWV4XLks,109360,112000,now because i believe in that is that i
a5egWV4XLks,112000,113920,sacrifice a little bit off the tee in
a5egWV4XLks,113920,115119,distance
a5egWV4XLks,115119,117119,and i could hit the ball further by
a5egWV4XLks,117119,119680,going to a harder golf ball but i lose
a5egWV4XLks,119680,121759,the ability to hit the spinnier shots
a5egWV4XLks,121759,123600,around the greens
a5egWV4XLks,123600,125840,i lose the ability to work the ball like
a5egWV4XLks,125840,127520,how i like to see it
a5egWV4XLks,127520,129440,maneuver in the air
a5egWV4XLks,129440,131840,and so there's there's that trade-off
a5egWV4XLks,131840,134959,now what's great about technology is
a5egWV4XLks,134959,136800,it's allowed me to have the workability
a5egWV4XLks,136800,139360,of a spinnier golf ball
a5egWV4XLks,139360,140080,but
a5egWV4XLks,140080,142720,the new aerodynamics that
a5egWV4XLks,142720,145280,we now have and so the ball is spinning
a5egWV4XLks,145280,146640,like it
a5egWV4XLks,146640,148400,kind of look what it used to when i
a5egWV4XLks,148400,150160,first came out on tour but i was flying
a5egWV4XLks,150160,151840,through the air better and so i'm
a5egWV4XLks,151840,154319,getting a golf ball that responds
a5egWV4XLks,154319,156720,to spin characteristics i like but also
a5egWV4XLks,156720,159519,it goes to the wind better and so it's
a5egWV4XLks,159519,161680,the best of both worlds now what i like
a5egWV4XLks,161680,163840,to see the ball go further absolutely
a5egWV4XLks,163840,166239,with my driver yes but there's a there's
a5egWV4XLks,166239,169450,trade-offs to it
a5egWV4XLks,169450,172480,[Music]
a5egWV4XLks,172480,175760,i used to do quite a bit of
a5egWV4XLks,175760,177120,club and ball testing
a5egWV4XLks,177120,179680,[Music]
a5egWV4XLks,179680,182000,when i had drivers built for me like 50
a5egWV4XLks,182000,183200,drivers
a5egWV4XLks,183200,184879,have to hit every single one of them a
a5egWV4XLks,184879,186000,few times
a5egWV4XLks,186000,187840,toss that one out toss that one out that
a5egWV4XLks,187840,189120,one's
a5egWV4XLks,189120,191040,that one's pretty good that one's kind
a5egWV4XLks,191040,193120,of let's just retest that one again next
a5egWV4XLks,193120,194560,you know you're going through a two-day
a5egWV4XLks,194560,196720,session of just testing drivers
a5egWV4XLks,196720,197519,well
a5egWV4XLks,197519,199599,now you have a you know launch monitors
a5egWV4XLks,199599,201200,you can test everything and get all the
a5egWV4XLks,201200,202720,information you can out of just a few
a5egWV4XLks,202720,204720,swings and you know whether a shaft
a5egWV4XLks,204720,206879,works the head works a weight system
a5egWV4XLks,206879,209519,works the golf ball works you know
a5egWV4XLks,209519,212640,intestines are so much easier now
a5egWV4XLks,212640,215680,but it was exhaustive
a5egWV4XLks,215680,217920,but also in a weird way
a5egWV4XLks,217920,218799,it
a5egWV4XLks,218799,222000,brought me this connection to my clubs
a5egWV4XLks,222000,224879,that i could feel things that
a5egWV4XLks,224879,226959,i don't know if other players felt or
a5egWV4XLks,226959,229680,not but i had to go earn it in the dirt
a5egWV4XLks,229680,230959,and feel it
a5egWV4XLks,230959,234080,and explain what i felt to the engineers
a5egWV4XLks,234080,235920,and why i didn't like it
a5egWV4XLks,235920,238319,that eventually put a set together that
a5egWV4XLks,238319,239599,i liked
a5egWV4XLks,239599,241680,but then it's the next generation of
a5egWV4XLks,241680,243040,stuff that would come out a new product
a5egWV4XLks,243040,245200,would come out and they said okay we
a5egWV4XLks,245200,247360,gotta test again for the new product
a5egWV4XLks,247360,249519,okay well there's another long testing
a5egWV4XLks,249519,251200,sessions and that would be days upon
a5egWV4XLks,251200,254239,days one days
a5egWV4XLks,254239,255760,thank god those days are over i don't
a5egWV4XLks,255760,257359,have to do that anymore
a5egWV4XLks,257359,259680,he will get a shipment of drivers you
a5egWV4XLks,259680,262160,know wedges putters whatever and
a5egWV4XLks,262160,263520,he will
a5egWV4XLks,263520,266320,very quickly sometimes decide which one
a5egWV4XLks,266320,268800,feels good just by waggling it just by
a5egWV4XLks,268800,270479,picking it up
a5egWV4XLks,270479,272240,and most of the time he'll say something
a5egWV4XLks,272240,274320,like i like the light one or i like the
a5egWV4XLks,274320,276479,heavy one and they're all supposed to be
a5egWV4XLks,276479,278880,the same and then i'll go back and
a5egWV4XLks,278880,281040,measure them you know weigh them all and
a5egWV4XLks,281040,282880,there will be one that's a gram or two
a5egWV4XLks,282880,284320,heavier
a5egWV4XLks,284320,286560,and you know that i think that's the
a5egWV4XLks,286560,288639,you know the stuff that most people just
a5egWV4XLks,288639,290800,can't feel that in their hands the you
a5egWV4XLks,290800,293199,know your the amount of sensitivity that
a5egWV4XLks,293199,294479,he has
a5egWV4XLks,294479,297759,really helps him uh to be a great player
a5egWV4XLks,297759,298800,tiger likes to get a little more
a5egWV4XLks,298800,299919,involved he likes to know what's going
a5egWV4XLks,299919,301440,on with his clubs and why it's reacting
a5egWV4XLks,301440,303440,a certain way he's not afraid to move
a5egWV4XLks,303440,304880,the weights around and stuff like that
a5egWV4XLks,304880,306720,so he's very involved but he lets the
a5egWV4XLks,306720,308479,guys handle it on their end and make the
a5egWV4XLks,308479,310560,clubs but he's very hands-on in terms of
a5egWV4XLks,310560,311680,what they're doing and what's going on
a5egWV4XLks,311680,314320,with the gloves
a5egWV4XLks,323199,326240,oh i've changed a lot because the driver
a5egWV4XLks,326240,328080,heads have gotten so much bigger
a5egWV4XLks,328080,329840,my dad always taught me to tee the ball
a5egWV4XLks,329840,330800,up
a5egWV4XLks,330800,332720,half half of the ball above the crown
a5egWV4XLks,332720,335039,half the ball below the crown well
a5egWV4XLks,335039,337520,well now that's that high
a5egWV4XLks,337520,340160,you know before it was like a iron on a
a5egWV4XLks,340160,341280,par three
a5egWV4XLks,341280,342560,and so
a5egWV4XLks,342560,344240,that's one of the evolutions that i've
a5egWV4XLks,344240,346000,had to try and
a5egWV4XLks,346000,347360,adjust to
a5egWV4XLks,347360,350160,technology because there was a time when
a5egWV4XLks,350160,351919,the driver had started explode and got
a5egWV4XLks,351919,353280,so much bigger
a5egWV4XLks,353280,355360,um i found myself using two different
a5egWV4XLks,355360,357680,golf swings i had a driver swing and
a5egWV4XLks,357680,359919,then my three went on downswing
a5egWV4XLks,359919,361919,and so trying to marry that up
a5egWV4XLks,361919,363919,is one of the challenges i've found
a5egWV4XLks,363919,365840,throughout you know the middle part of
a5egWV4XLks,365840,368240,my career
a5egWV4XLks,371039,372960,when i was young i thought that
a5egWV4XLks,372960,375600,if you could hit your 8-iron 150 you
a5egWV4XLks,375600,377600,know you were one of the big guys
a5egWV4XLks,377600,378639,you know
a5egWV4XLks,378639,380479,that was you know the old blotter ball
a5egWV4XLks,380479,381360,the
a5egWV4XLks,381360,383520,the iron lofts were weaker at the time
a5egWV4XLks,383520,385840,than than the standard lofts now
a5egWV4XLks,385840,387360,and so you're one of one of the bigger
a5egWV4XLks,387360,388880,hitters well now you get guys hitting
a5egWV4XLks,388880,390479,wedges 160
a5egWV4XLks,390479,391440,and so
a5egWV4XLks,391440,393280,the game has evolved but
a5egWV4XLks,393280,396400,i've played the same lofts that i
a5egWV4XLks,396400,398000,when i first got my first full length
a5egWV4XLks,398000,400319,set and so that hasn't changed so my
a5egWV4XLks,400319,402240,loss are relatively weak
a5egWV4XLks,402240,404880,compared to today's standards
a5egWV4XLks,404880,406880,or take for example a
a5egWV4XLks,406880,409360,simple pitching wedge
a5egWV4XLks,409360,410639,there's something standard somewhere
a5egWV4XLks,410639,412400,around 45 degrees
a5egWV4XLks,412400,414400,well that's what my nine iron is
a5egWV4XLks,414400,415680,and so
a5egWV4XLks,415680,417680,i'm probably three quarters of a club
a5egWV4XLks,417680,420160,weaker maybe a half a club weaker than
a5egWV4XLks,420160,422720,the standard now
a5egWV4XLks,422720,423440,but
a5egWV4XLks,423440,424400,i'm still hitting them all the same
a5egWV4XLks,424400,427039,distances so i haven't had to adjust you
a5egWV4XLks,427039,428479,know that much over my course of my
a5egWV4XLks,428479,430639,career of hitting the ball you know my
a5egWV4XLks,430639,431759,numbers my numbers have stayed
a5egWV4XLks,431759,433360,relatively the same
a5egWV4XLks,433360,436240,[Music]
a5egWV4XLks,436240,438160,i do like having
a5egWV4XLks,438160,441039,fresh wedges in there
a5egWV4XLks,441039,443120,pretty much almost every week i play and
a5egWV4XLks,443120,445199,that's just because of spin
a5egWV4XLks,445199,446160,now
a5egWV4XLks,446160,448000,the my configuration doesn't really
a5egWV4XLks,448000,452319,change to the bounce and the setup of it
a5egWV4XLks,452319,454560,but i spent so much time as i was
a5egWV4XLks,454560,456160,alluding to chipping
a5egWV4XLks,456160,457360,that
a5egWV4XLks,457360,458960,i wear out my grooves
a5egWV4XLks,458960,460720,and if they'd lose a little bit of
a5egWV4XLks,460720,463120,friction that's a little spin i lost and
a5egWV4XLks,463120,465440,i could gain that back by having new
a5egWV4XLks,465440,467840,wedges
a5egWV4XLks,469870,477680,[Music]
a5egWV4XLks,477680,479120,simplicity
a5egWV4XLks,479120,480879,you know i like if something that looks
a5egWV4XLks,480879,484240,very clean in a playing position
a5egWV4XLks,484240,485919,uncomplicated
a5egWV4XLks,485919,488319,very simple feel like i can
a5egWV4XLks,488319,490319,i can look at this thing all day it has
a5egWV4XLks,490319,491680,to start there
a5egWV4XLks,491680,492800,you know if i don't like the way it
a5egWV4XLks,492800,494479,looks i'm not going to use it
a5egWV4XLks,494479,496400,it may perform better than what i have
a5egWV4XLks,496400,497759,but if it doesn't if i'm fighting the
a5egWV4XLks,497759,500160,way it looks and i have to rely on it in
a5egWV4XLks,500160,501759,on the 72nd hole of a tournament if i
a5egWV4XLks,501759,504479,can't stand it
a5egWV4XLks,504879,505840,i'm probably not going to give it a
a5egWV4XLks,505840,508160,chance okay so it has to look good well
a5egWV4XLks,508160,511599,then after that it has to perform
a5egWV4XLks,511599,514159,at my expectation
a5egWV4XLks,514159,516560,and if it's not doing those two things
a5egWV4XLks,516560,520919,then it's just not in
a5egWV4XLks,524800,527040,golf is a microcosm of life there's
a5egWV4XLks,527040,528320,going to be ups and downs there'll be
a5egWV4XLks,528320,530000,challenges there's going to be ebbs and
a5egWV4XLks,530000,531279,flows and
a5egWV4XLks,531279,532560,ultimately
a5egWV4XLks,532560,533839,when it comes right down to it we
a5egWV4XLks,533839,535519,determine our own fate
a5egWV4XLks,535519,538959,and it's okay to feel uncomfortable
a5egWV4XLks,538959,540560,am i ever nervous
a5egWV4XLks,540560,541839,are you kidding me
a5egWV4XLks,541839,544160,no i'm i'm nervous on the very first
a5egWV4XLks,544160,545920,shot i'm nervous throughout the entire
a5egWV4XLks,545920,546720,day
a5egWV4XLks,546720,549200,but it's how i channel and how i harness
a5egWV4XLks,549200,550320,it
a5egWV4XLks,550320,553279,how do i put that energy into
a5egWV4XLks,553279,556399,either deeper focus or deeper intensity
a5egWV4XLks,556399,558160,and it's not not to be ashamed of it or
a5egWV4XLks,558160,560160,afraid of it
a5egWV4XLks,560160,563319,go after
