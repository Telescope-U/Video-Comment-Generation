KIDLu5pVoWM,180570,181830,- Looks very happy.
KIDLu5pVoWM,181830,184030,- You naughty cow!
KIDLu5pVoWM,184030,186140,"All right, do you know how to work that thing?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,186140,187730,- [Rhett] Don't be so bashful.
KIDLu5pVoWM,187730,190200,"- So without further ado, the top eight dishes"
KIDLu5pVoWM,190200,193507,are animal style In-N-Out mac and cheese.

KIDLu5pVoWM,206290,208640,- [Link] Orange chicken parm.
KIDLu5pVoWM,208640,211380,- [Rhett] And Popeye's breakfast burrito.
KIDLu5pVoWM,211380,216030,"- I almost orange chicken parmesan, but then I said parm."
KIDLu5pVoWM,216030,217340,"- Yeah, well, I understood."
KIDLu5pVoWM,217340,218940,"- In the end, only one dish will be given"
KIDLu5pVoWM,218940,221705,the honorable title of Our Lord and Savor.
KIDLu5pVoWM,221705,222538,(Rhett laughs)
KIDLu5pVoWM,222538,224661,And will receive the golden halo.
KIDLu5pVoWM,224661,226084,(clapping) So let's eat!
KIDLu5pVoWM,226084,227880,(intense upbeat music)
KIDLu5pVoWM,227880,229550,"- Okay, we're starting out with our first seed,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,229550,231540,animal style In-N-Out mac and cheese
KIDLu5pVoWM,231540,234590,"up against our eighth seed, Uncrustables chicken sandwich."
KIDLu5pVoWM,234590,236830,"So this mac and cheese, again, this is macaroni"
KIDLu5pVoWM,236830,239080,"made out of dehydrated In-N-Out French fries,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,239080,241340,then you got the secret animal style spread
KIDLu5pVoWM,241340,242830,and American cheese on top
KIDLu5pVoWM,242830,245180,"and then some caramelized onions, as well."
KIDLu5pVoWM,245180,247069,- [Nicole] Don't forget the French fry breadcrumbs.
KIDLu5pVoWM,247070,250080,- French fry bread crumbs. (stuttering) Crumbs.
KIDLu5pVoWM,250080,251480,- Bread crumbs.
KIDLu5pVoWM,251480,252525,- Bread crumbs. Be careful.
KIDLu5pVoWM,252525,253840,(crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,253840,257810,- So the miraculous thing here is that you made pasta
KIDLu5pVoWM,257810,259780,out of French fries.
KIDLu5pVoWM,259780,260613,- [Nicole] Yeah-
KIDLu5pVoWM,260613,262310,"- Actually from In-N-Out. - [Nicole] Oh, yeah."
KIDLu5pVoWM,262310,263143,- And I remember.
KIDLu5pVoWM,263143,265710,"This is from 2019, ""Will It Mac and Cheese?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,265710,267319,And I just remember feeling
KIDLu5pVoWM,267320,270320,so strongly about this in the moment.
KIDLu5pVoWM,270320,271640,Let's see if it- - Dink it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,271640,273773,- Sink it. Returns to that glory.
KIDLu5pVoWM,276750,277583,- It does! (laughs)
KIDLu5pVoWM,277583,279790,- It's just so decadent.
KIDLu5pVoWM,279790,282170,It feels like it's about to be too much.
KIDLu5pVoWM,282170,283340,- You're about to choke and die?
KIDLu5pVoWM,283340,284949,"- Yeah, it's about to be too much,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,284950,286710,"but then it's like, no, I'm just right."
KIDLu5pVoWM,286710,288120,- Yeah and you know what?
KIDLu5pVoWM,288120,290650,"I'm gonna take note of when I wanna go in for another bite,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,290650,291830,but I'm not gonna do it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,291830,292663,- I want to.
KIDLu5pVoWM,292663,295000,- Because that is the data I need
KIDLu5pVoWM,295000,297100,to determine which one I'm going for first.
KIDLu5pVoWM,297100,299640,"Over here, the Uncrustables chicken sandwich."
KIDLu5pVoWM,299640,301000,Grab your half of this.
KIDLu5pVoWM,301000,302840,"You got an Uncrustable on top,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,302840,304410,you got an Uncrustable on the bottom.
KIDLu5pVoWM,304410,307160,"Not a sponsor, and then right here in the middle,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,307160,310400,"you've got fried chicken cutlet dipped in peanut butter,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,310400,313490,"dipped in jelly, with a peanut butter covered pickle"
KIDLu5pVoWM,313490,314940,hiding underneath.
KIDLu5pVoWM,314940,316209,- This is not too long ago.
KIDLu5pVoWM,316209,319168,"My birthday, October 11th, 2021."
KIDLu5pVoWM,319168,321633,"- Smuckers uncluck-ables, is what we called it."
KIDLu5pVoWM,323850,324853,- It's still good.
KIDLu5pVoWM,325760,327960,"- But let's be real. - [Rhett] Oh, man."
KIDLu5pVoWM,327960,331240,"- It's amazing, yet strange."
KIDLu5pVoWM,331240,332830,"- The peanut butter and the jelly,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,332830,334250,they do something to the fried chicken
KIDLu5pVoWM,334250,336040,that is a little bit unexpected.
KIDLu5pVoWM,336040,338880,"I like it, but it's not like the best thing"
KIDLu5pVoWM,338880,341860,"I've ever tasted, which this might be."
KIDLu5pVoWM,341860,343080,- A little bit of school lunch
KIDLu5pVoWM,343080,346330,and a lot of chicken sandwich does not beat it out.
KIDLu5pVoWM,346330,350429,- So the In-N-Out animal style mac and cheese is moving on.
KIDLu5pVoWM,350429,352199,"We're gonna bring this back,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,352200,353480,so we'll get more in a little bit.
KIDLu5pVoWM,353480,357343,"- Yes! Moo-chelle, move it on, girl!"
KIDLu5pVoWM,357343,358210,(screen popping)
KIDLu5pVoWM,358210,360229,- Hey! Oh!
KIDLu5pVoWM,360230,362220,What kind of magic did you just do with your hoof?
KIDLu5pVoWM,362220,364740,- Did you really do that
KIDLu5pVoWM,364740,366772,or was that just like a timing thing?
KIDLu5pVoWM,368133,369199,"Okay, okay."
KIDLu5pVoWM,369199,370769,"- Yeah, yeah. Taking all the credit, just like Vanna."
KIDLu5pVoWM,370769,372568,(upbeat intense music)
KIDLu5pVoWM,372568,374560,- These are tightly seeded.
KIDLu5pVoWM,374560,377980,"Number four, we've got grilled cheese ramen,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,377980,379890,a beautiful situation. - Yeah.
KIDLu5pVoWM,379890,383890,"- Up again the number five seed, Wendy's Baconator lasagna."
KIDLu5pVoWM,383890,385460,"- Boy, these both made an impression."
KIDLu5pVoWM,385460,387650,"This is from 2019, ""Will It Ramen?"""
KIDLu5pVoWM,387650,390240,"You've got the cheddar broth, tomato soup noodles,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,390240,392727,deep fried soft boiled egg crushed in bread cumbs.
KIDLu5pVoWM,392727,394690,"(laughs) Hey, I keep saying that."
KIDLu5pVoWM,394690,396410,I wanna say that word. - Bread crumbs.
KIDLu5pVoWM,396410,400040,- And then pork grilled cheese sandwich arranged on top.
KIDLu5pVoWM,400040,402470,Look at that! That's just a pork grilled cheese sandwich!
KIDLu5pVoWM,402470,403910,- [Link] Let's dig in.
KIDLu5pVoWM,403910,406400,"I wanna show off these noods, man."
KIDLu5pVoWM,406400,410063,Look at how amazing and cheesy that looks.
KIDLu5pVoWM,410063,411569,- Man. That broth.
KIDLu5pVoWM,411570,416202,- Get some cheese broth. (slurping)
KIDLu5pVoWM,416202,418320,- [Rhett] And just look at that breadcrumb egg.
KIDLu5pVoWM,418320,420630,"- And Nicole, remind me, what's in the middle of this?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,420630,423380,That's a pork slice in the middle of my grilled cheese?
KIDLu5pVoWM,423380,424800,"- [Nicole] Yes, so it's chashu pork,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,424800,427509,"which is traditionally in ramen, with some American cheese"
KIDLu5pVoWM,427510,429910,and just great old American cheese.
KIDLu5pVoWM,429910,431870,- It's so good.
KIDLu5pVoWM,431870,433610,- So much American cheese.
KIDLu5pVoWM,433610,436125,"Yeah, I'm wanting to go back immediately."
KIDLu5pVoWM,436125,436958,- [Rhett] That broth.
KIDLu5pVoWM,436958,439537,"- That's saying a lot, but instead of going back to that,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,439537,444389,we are gonna go back to January 11th of 2021
KIDLu5pVoWM,444390,446190,"for ""Will It Lasagna?"""
KIDLu5pVoWM,446190,449030,Season premiere of season 19.
KIDLu5pVoWM,449030,451630,- I remember like it was a year ago.
KIDLu5pVoWM,451630,452463,- Do you?
KIDLu5pVoWM,452463,453360,- [Rhett] No.
KIDLu5pVoWM,453360,454975,"- [Link] Oh, you're going off of that one, huh?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,454976,456680,I'll go off of the same one. - [Rhett] I'll go off of it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,456680,458960,- [Link] Pasta dough with American cheese
KIDLu5pVoWM,458960,460564,in the pasta dough?
KIDLu5pVoWM,460564,461880,- [Nicole] Mm-hmm.
KIDLu5pVoWM,461880,464630,"- Sauce with hamburger meat and bacon, of course."
KIDLu5pVoWM,464630,467810,"Bun, bread crumbs, and topped with more cheese."
KIDLu5pVoWM,467810,470057,So much cheese in this round!
KIDLu5pVoWM,470058,474570,- Can you just? Can you just like both of them?
KIDLu5pVoWM,474570,477347,Do you have to choose? I got two children.
KIDLu5pVoWM,477347,479409,"I like one of them a little bit more than the other,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,479410,483260,"but I mean, really, I love them equally."
KIDLu5pVoWM,483260,485370,"I love the taste of both of these,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,485370,488710,but there's something about the way that.
KIDLu5pVoWM,488710,490440,I would've that you would've said this already.
KIDLu5pVoWM,490440,493140,The way lasagna comes together in one bite
KIDLu5pVoWM,493140,495800,that is everything concentrated into one thing.
KIDLu5pVoWM,495800,496633,- That's true.
KIDLu5pVoWM,496633,500300,"- This is an egg, noodles, broth, grilled cheese."
KIDLu5pVoWM,500300,502460,"It's a whole meal in and of itself,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,502460,505160,but I don't know if it really represents the perfect bite.
KIDLu5pVoWM,505160,508070,"- No, but that's not the only criteria, my man."
KIDLu5pVoWM,508070,512573,"This is so cheese dominant that I'm not actually,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,513556,515349,"honestly, I didn't experience any bacon"
KIDLu5pVoWM,515349,517003,and it's called a Baconator.
KIDLu5pVoWM,517969,520870,I think you would expect for us to be talking about bacon
KIDLu5pVoWM,520870,522370,"just as much as cheese, right?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,523580,524650,I don't think it happened.
KIDLu5pVoWM,524650,527367,"This over here, there's a little bit of variety."
KIDLu5pVoWM,527367,528200,- [Rhett] Okay.
KIDLu5pVoWM,528200,531120,- There's an unfolding experience
KIDLu5pVoWM,531120,532710,and I didn't even get the egg.
KIDLu5pVoWM,532710,533993,That scotch egg type of situation.
KIDLu5pVoWM,533993,536833,"- [Rhett] Well, because you're afraid of a yolk. It's okay."
KIDLu5pVoWM,536833,538680,"- No, no, I wanna go back in and get some of that."
KIDLu5pVoWM,538680,539770,"- All right, well, you know what?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,539770,540990,You'll have the opportunity to do that
KIDLu5pVoWM,540990,542130,because I agree with you.
KIDLu5pVoWM,542130,543495,As great as this is-
KIDLu5pVoWM,543495,544328,(Stevie gasping)
KIDLu5pVoWM,544328,545170,"The bacon- - What, what, what. Hold on."
KIDLu5pVoWM,545170,547779,"- [Stevie] What? No, do you need another opinion?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,547779,548940,(crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,548940,550270,- The Mythical crew-
KIDLu5pVoWM,550270,551431,- [Stevie] You can't do this. - Including Stevie.
KIDLu5pVoWM,551431,552264,- [Stevie] You can't do this.
KIDLu5pVoWM,552264,553290,"- Well, you knew it was gonna be Link"
KIDLu5pVoWM,553290,554690,that was gonna screw your bracket up.
KIDLu5pVoWM,554690,556040,"- They have a pool, they have a pool,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,556040,558519,and we have a trophy for the winner.
KIDLu5pVoWM,558520,561610,I think we're gonna unveil that in Good Mythical More
KIDLu5pVoWM,561610,563220,when the tournament's over.
KIDLu5pVoWM,563220,565547,"But Stevie, it seems like you picked the lasagna."
KIDLu5pVoWM,565547,567260,- [Stevie] I feel like you're judging.
KIDLu5pVoWM,567260,571300,Maybe there was less bacon in this particular iteration
KIDLu5pVoWM,571300,573300,"because I remember when you had it the first time,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,573300,574899,you really we're leaning into the bacon.
KIDLu5pVoWM,574900,576520,You really loved it- - I'll take another bite.
KIDLu5pVoWM,576520,578322,- [Stevie] I agree about the bite-ability-
KIDLu5pVoWM,578322,579322,- [Link] I'll take another bite.
KIDLu5pVoWM,579322,580210,- [Stevie] And the portability on Rhett's side.
KIDLu5pVoWM,580210,582880,"- I was ready to call Moo-chelle in to do a tiebreaker, but."
KIDLu5pVoWM,582880,584280,"- Nicole, did you do a bracket?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,584280,586390,"- [Nicole] No, I was busy cooking all the stuff."
KIDLu5pVoWM,586390,587690,- Exactly. - I don't have time.
KIDLu5pVoWM,587690,589580,- Which one is your choice?
KIDLu5pVoWM,589580,590737,- [Nicole] It's the ramen.
KIDLu5pVoWM,590737,592090,(Rhett laughs)
KIDLu5pVoWM,592090,594940,"- Okay, then that's what we're going with. Sorry, Stevie."
KIDLu5pVoWM,595963,597420,- It is incredible.
KIDLu5pVoWM,597420,598320,"- [Stevie] We'll talk about this later, Nicole."
KIDLu5pVoWM,598320,599940,- It's incredible! (crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,599940,603010,"All right, Moo-chelle. Did you do a bracket?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,603010,604650,"Okay good, see, you're impartial."
KIDLu5pVoWM,604650,607750,"Move the ramen along, please."
KIDLu5pVoWM,607750,608730,It's magic.
KIDLu5pVoWM,608730,610870,- (laughs) It never gets old.
KIDLu5pVoWM,610870,612560,"- Stevie, when you see that happen,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,612560,613834,you forget all of your worries.
KIDLu5pVoWM,613834,615292,- I don't think so. - [Stevie] I accept it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,615292,617261,(upbeat intense music)
KIDLu5pVoWM,617261,618490,"- All right, we got our third seed,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,618490,622279,"KFC Chipotle burrito drumstick going against our sixth seed,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,622280,623440,the Doritos Big Mac.
KIDLu5pVoWM,623440,625297,"Now, the KFC, this is from the KFC"
KIDLu5pVoWM,625297,627370,and Chipotle mashup menu taste this.
KIDLu5pVoWM,627370,630330,"This is a bucket of KFC fried chicken,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,630330,631440,"drumsticks, of course,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,631440,634050,"coasted in shredded Chipotle barbacoa,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,634050,635630,"black beans, queso, guacamole,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,635630,637670,wrapped in a tortilla and then deep fried.
KIDLu5pVoWM,637670,639052,- Don't eat the string!
KIDLu5pVoWM,639052,641790,"- Oh, God. Dink it."
KIDLu5pVoWM,641790,643110,- Dunk it. Doink it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,643110,643950,(crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,643950,645200,- And swink it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,648764,650019,(Rhett laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,650020,650947,"- [Link] Oh, my gosh."
KIDLu5pVoWM,650947,651830,(Rhett laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,651830,653890,"Oh, my freaking gosh."
KIDLu5pVoWM,653890,656000,- I feel like we're gonna get struck by lightning.
KIDLu5pVoWM,656000,656833,You know what I'm saying?
KIDLu5pVoWM,656833,657666,- I'm getting guacamole.
KIDLu5pVoWM,657666,660210,"- I just feel like the karma in the universe is like,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,660210,661760,you can't have this good of a time.
KIDLu5pVoWM,661760,663440,- No. - Someone has to die.
KIDLu5pVoWM,663440,664510,- No.
KIDLu5pVoWM,664510,665343,- I think it's gonna be you. (laughs)
KIDLu5pVoWM,665343,668210,"- No, what's gonna happen is Friday's gonna happen."
KIDLu5pVoWM,668210,669090,- I wanna take another bite.
KIDLu5pVoWM,669090,670240,"- [Link] Barbacoa. Oh, you see?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,670240,672099,There you go. You can't resist it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,672099,675270,"- I think we talked about this last time, but the guacamole,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,675270,678250,"you're like, guacamole, it's been deep-fried."
KIDLu5pVoWM,678250,679083,It works.
KIDLu5pVoWM,679083,679917,"- Oh, my gosh. It's so good!"
KIDLu5pVoWM,679917,683839,- It doesn't have the cold or even room temperature quality
KIDLu5pVoWM,683840,686590,"that guacamole usually has, but somehow, it works."
KIDLu5pVoWM,686590,689470,- Look at this amazing creation
KIDLu5pVoWM,689470,693996,"from July 27th, 2020, episode 1780."
KIDLu5pVoWM,693997,695150,(Rhett laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,695150,697660,Good Mythical summer premiere.
KIDLu5pVoWM,697660,700569,We have got Dorito-fied Big Mac.
KIDLu5pVoWM,700570,702000,- I'm making a mess.
KIDLu5pVoWM,702000,703750,"- Tapatio-Dorito crusted burger buns,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,703750,708270,"OG Dorito-infused special sauce, spicy nacho cheese,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,708270,710230,"cool ranch infused burger patties,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,710230,712610,"fried onions battered with Doritos crumbs,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,712610,716410,flaming hot lemon Doritos pickles.
KIDLu5pVoWM,716410,719259,- Did I get my mouth around this last time?
KIDLu5pVoWM,719260,720470,- [Nicole] You kinda compressed it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,720470,721513,- Compress it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,729320,730750,A lot corny-ness.
KIDLu5pVoWM,730750,733520,"- It's really, really, really good."
KIDLu5pVoWM,733520,735500,"- The meat is something, I'm kinda hanging"
KIDLu5pVoWM,735500,737790,"onto the meat here, in terms of something"
KIDLu5pVoWM,737790,739639,that gets me out of Dorito land.
KIDLu5pVoWM,739640,742310,- I like the spicy kick. I'm really into this.
KIDLu5pVoWM,742310,744870,"Something about the Doritos, if I'm finding a thing"
KIDLu5pVoWM,744870,747970,"to be critical of, the Doritos create a crunch"
KIDLu5pVoWM,747970,750850,that is reminiscent of a stale bun.
KIDLu5pVoWM,750850,751683,Does that make sense?
KIDLu5pVoWM,751683,753760,So from a texture standpoint- - Yeah.
KIDLu5pVoWM,753760,756460,"- I'm thinking about the bun kinda giving,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,756460,758330,but then it's got this hard thing on the outside
KIDLu5pVoWM,758330,760090,that just does something to my mind.
KIDLu5pVoWM,760090,761160,I'm just kinda trying to find.
KIDLu5pVoWM,761160,763589,I'm stretching to find something to not like about it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,763590,767930,- I think the Doritos are soaking up moisture.
KIDLu5pVoWM,767930,769723,I feel sad that this has to go.
KIDLu5pVoWM,769723,770613,- It's great.
KIDLu5pVoWM,771460,774720,- But this right here! It's this right here!
KIDLu5pVoWM,774720,775600,- It's so special.
KIDLu5pVoWM,775600,776810,"- [Link] Oh, my goodness."
KIDLu5pVoWM,776810,778040,- [Rhett] Look how much grease just came out of that thing.
KIDLu5pVoWM,778040,779011,"- Yeah, see, all the grease is soaked up,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,779012,782320,"so if you don't have the grease fun, either."
KIDLu5pVoWM,782320,785590,"- Okay, so the fried chicken drumsticks,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,785590,788420,"KFC Chipotle drumsticks, they're moving on."
KIDLu5pVoWM,788420,790980,"- Moo-chelle, do you magic touch."
KIDLu5pVoWM,790980,791813,- [Rhett] What are you?
KIDLu5pVoWM,791813,793240,- [Link] Focus. This is not time for 'Gram.
KIDLu5pVoWM,793240,795260,- [Rhett] You got social media time.
KIDLu5pVoWM,795260,796380,- There you go.
KIDLu5pVoWM,796380,797823,Do you have an Instagram?
KIDLu5pVoWM,799700,801010,- [Rhett] Just thinking about it?
KIDLu5pVoWM,801010,802780,(upbeat intense music)
KIDLu5pVoWM,802780,804130,"- Last up in our preliminary round,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,804130,806570,you remember the orange chicken parm.
KIDLu5pVoWM,806570,809560,"It's seed number two versus the number seven seed,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,809560,811830,Popeye's breakfast burrito.
KIDLu5pVoWM,811830,813970,"- Now, this orange chicken parm wasn't too long ago."
KIDLu5pVoWM,813970,817980,"November 2021 and if you remember,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,817980,821110,it was also voted the number one food creation
KIDLu5pVoWM,821110,823089,of 2021 for the show.
KIDLu5pVoWM,823090,825720,I just remember being blown away by this thing.
KIDLu5pVoWM,825720,826553,"- [Link] Oh, yeah."
KIDLu5pVoWM,826553,829630,I'm glad that we're getting to experience it again.
KIDLu5pVoWM,829630,831560,- I had somebody just come up to me on the street
KIDLu5pVoWM,831560,832393,and talk about this.
KIDLu5pVoWM,832393,833550,- [Link] Really? - Yeah.
KIDLu5pVoWM,836455,838810,- It's hot. It's hot.
KIDLu5pVoWM,838810,839643,"- Oh, man."
KIDLu5pVoWM,842962,844160,(Link muttering)
KIDLu5pVoWM,844160,846198,Not at all. You must've gotten the hot spot.
KIDLu5pVoWM,846198,847320,(crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,847320,849367,It's everything you love about orange chicken
KIDLu5pVoWM,849367,851985,"and that tanginess, with a bunch of cheese on it."
KIDLu5pVoWM,851985,854670,It's so simple and why I like it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,854670,857001,It's not trying too hard. - There's a green onion.
KIDLu5pVoWM,857001,859500,- It doesn't have too many ingredients.
KIDLu5pVoWM,859500,860370,It's just balanced.
KIDLu5pVoWM,860370,862480,It's like a dish that was supposed to happen
KIDLu5pVoWM,862480,864130,that the universe wanted to birth
KIDLu5pVoWM,864130,865990,and it just happen to happen on our show.
KIDLu5pVoWM,865990,866823,It's wonderful.
KIDLu5pVoWM,866823,868380,"- Oh, no, it just didn't happen on our show."
KIDLu5pVoWM,868380,869690,"It happened on purpose. Right, Nicole?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,869690,870770,- It was destiny.
KIDLu5pVoWM,870770,871783,- [Nicole] That's right. - Yeah.
KIDLu5pVoWM,871783,873220,- (laughs) That's right.
KIDLu5pVoWM,873220,874709,- All right.
KIDLu5pVoWM,874710,878400,Popeye's breakfast burrito is the underdog here.
KIDLu5pVoWM,878400,880190,You poached the eggs and gravy.
KIDLu5pVoWM,880190,884130,"You got cajun rice, mashed tater hash brown,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,884130,888810,"pickle and spicy mayo salsa, and chicken tender chorizo."
KIDLu5pVoWM,888810,891223,Refresh my memory on how and what that is.
KIDLu5pVoWM,891223,892730,"- [Nicole] Yeah, so I just chopped up"
KIDLu5pVoWM,892730,893820,a bunch of chicken tenders.
KIDLu5pVoWM,893820,896820,"I added some chorizo spices, some vinegar, some chilies,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,896820,899710,and I cooked it down and mashed it into a beautiful chorizo.
KIDLu5pVoWM,899710,901660,"- And this was October 12, 2020."
KIDLu5pVoWM,901660,902493,- It is beautiful.
KIDLu5pVoWM,902493,905483,- We called it the Louisiana Slammer. Let's do it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,907350,910899,- It's very rich. It's very good.
KIDLu5pVoWM,910900,913070,I'm having a difficult time
KIDLu5pVoWM,913070,915230,differentiating the flavors almost.
KIDLu5pVoWM,915230,916063,Do you know what I'm saying?
KIDLu5pVoWM,916063,918160,- It's still very Popeye's.
KIDLu5pVoWM,918160,920529,"This is great, but it ain't that. You knew that."
KIDLu5pVoWM,920530,922410,"- Yeah, the orange chicken parm-"
KIDLu5pVoWM,922410,923740,- Gotta move on. - The clear winner.
KIDLu5pVoWM,923740,925843,"- Moo-chelle, push it."
KIDLu5pVoWM,927078,927911,- [Rhett] Nice.
KIDLu5pVoWM,927911,929115,"- [Link] Yeah, she tapped it."
KIDLu5pVoWM,929115,931350,(upbeat intense music)
KIDLu5pVoWM,931350,932870,- Welcome to the semifinals!
KIDLu5pVoWM,932870,933703,"The number one seed,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,933703,934880,the animal style In-N-Out mac and cheese
KIDLu5pVoWM,934880,937430,"up against the number four seed, grilled cheese ramen!"
KIDLu5pVoWM,937430,940290,"- Okay, it's still a cheese battle in this bracket, dude."
KIDLu5pVoWM,940290,941990,- Cheese showed up a lot.
KIDLu5pVoWM,941990,944959,"- Savory, savory, and I'm gonna try to get more of the-"
KIDLu5pVoWM,944960,945920,- [Rhett] Actual mac?
KIDLu5pVoWM,945920,947253,- And the sauce.
KIDLu5pVoWM,949920,954170,"It really is amazing how the mac tastes like fries,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,954170,955740,but behaves like mac.
KIDLu5pVoWM,955740,959980,- I will say that having so much good stuff in a row.
KIDLu5pVoWM,959980,960813,- [Link] Yeah.
KIDLu5pVoWM,960813,963399,"- There's a little note of, is this too much?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,963400,964350,Could you keep eating this?
KIDLu5pVoWM,964350,966449,- Too much of a good thing a couple of bites in?
KIDLu5pVoWM,966450,967340,- It kinda hit me.
KIDLu5pVoWM,967340,970880,"- Now ramen, I want to apologize for what you might've heard"
KIDLu5pVoWM,970880,972771,Stevie say in the previous round.
KIDLu5pVoWM,972771,973640,(crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,973640,975100,- Yeah. - Don't take it personally.
KIDLu5pVoWM,975100,976029,- You ruined it for her.
KIDLu5pVoWM,976030,977970,- It's not that she doesn't love you.
KIDLu5pVoWM,977970,980615,It's just that she loves her bracket more.
KIDLu5pVoWM,980616,982053,"- Wow, I mean."
KIDLu5pVoWM,983630,986260,"Because the cheese is in the broth,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,986260,990840,it creates the flavor of cheese without the overwhelming-
KIDLu5pVoWM,990840,991673,- Look at that.
KIDLu5pVoWM,991673,994032,- Presence of cheese. Does that make sense?
KIDLu5pVoWM,995070,995903,- Yeah.
KIDLu5pVoWM,995903,998260,- It's such a strong cheese flavor.
KIDLu5pVoWM,998260,1000387,You already said your peace about how much you like this.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1000387,1002340,- [Link] I love it even more the second time.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1002340,1006130,- I've come around completely because I never.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1006130,1008400,Good Lord. I never thought.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1008400,1011710,"When I tasted this, I thought we had hit a peak on the show,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1011710,1015670,"but now, I'm kinda understanding the subtlety of this,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1015670,1018360,coming back to after I've tried eight things.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1018360,1019730,I would make a meal out of this.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1019730,1020860,- This is a great side.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1020860,1022350,- The reason that I didn't like it before
KIDLu5pVoWM,1022350,1024730,is becoming the reason that I do like it!
KIDLu5pVoWM,1024730,1025563,"- Yeah, yeah."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1025563,1027822,- [Stevie] What a twist and turn we find ourselves in.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1027822,1028810,(Rhett laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1028810,1031980,- We are choosing the grilled cheese ramen.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1031980,1035030,"I'm sorry, loaded In-N-Out mac and cheese."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1035030,1035900,You gots to go.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1035900,1037050,"- Stevie, you can have this."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1037050,1039260,- [Stevie] I think we're all having a great time.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1039260,1041310,"- Moo-chelle doesn't agree, either."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1041310,1045000,Too late. Ramen moves on. Yes!
KIDLu5pVoWM,1045000,1046280,- To the finals!
KIDLu5pVoWM,1046280,1048079,Ramen! Who knew?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1048079,1048913,- Me.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1048913,1051039,(upbeat intense music)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1051040,1054140,"Number three seed, KFC Chipotle burrito drumstick."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1054140,1058950,"Number two seed, orange chicken parm. (stuttering)"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1058950,1059820,Let's go back.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1059820,1060899,- I'm going to the back end.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1060900,1063570,"Now, this may squeeze barbacoa right out."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1063570,1065990,- I'm going into the sasme spot.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1065990,1068079,- Got all the way to the chicken that time.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1068079,1069772,You know what it's reminiscent of?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1069772,1070605,- What?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1070605,1073110,- Avocado egg rolls from Cheesecake Factory.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1073110,1073943,- [Link] At Cheesecake Factory.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1073943,1076350,- Which are a fried thing that has avocado in it
KIDLu5pVoWM,1076350,1077700,that you wouldn't think.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1077700,1079320,"It's like, that's the point of reference for me"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1079320,1081860,"and it really, really works."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1081860,1084330,"- Yeah, the fried-ness of the chicken"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1084330,1087539,is kinda like the fried-ness of the egg roll.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1087540,1088683,"Good gosh, it's good."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1089560,1090990,I love it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1090990,1092010,"- [Rhett] Okay, and then back here again."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1092010,1094140,- I'm gonna try to get another and a second bite.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1094140,1096240,"When you get into more of the chicken,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1096240,1098750,you're just left with a KFC drumstick
KIDLu5pVoWM,1098750,1101880,"and there's nothing to complain about there, you know?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1101880,1103593,"Hopefully, this isn't as hot the second time."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1103593,1105630,Is it hot? I'm gonna put some of that green onion.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1105630,1108640,- I think you got a hot spot. My mouth is very confused.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1108640,1110440,- This is more orange-y this time.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1110440,1111909,"- This is crazy because it's like,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1111910,1113080,deep fried piece of chicken
KIDLu5pVoWM,1113080,1115529,"and it's kinda like getting into to state fair place,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1115530,1117520,but there's something like this could be a dish-
KIDLu5pVoWM,1117520,1118450,- [Link] At a sit down restaurant.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1118450,1119490,- [Rhett] At a sit down restaurant.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1119490,1121700,- But you pointed out something
KIDLu5pVoWM,1121700,1122990,that still makes it difficult for me
KIDLu5pVoWM,1122990,1125800,because I love to go to the fair
KIDLu5pVoWM,1125800,1128850,and see some new ingenuity
KIDLu5pVoWM,1128850,1130809,they're charging way too much money for.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1130810,1132834,- But there's a string. Isn't that a demerit?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1132834,1135390,"- Yes, it is. I don't like the string."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1135390,1138460,This is gimmicky. This makes total sense.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1138460,1140190,"It's like, why hasn't this been done?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1140190,1142820,"- I'm on chicken parm, so if you are, we can move along."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1142820,1144448,"If you're not, we can get Moo-chelle to do a tiebreaker."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1144448,1147760,She wants to. Look at her. She's very anxious to.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1147760,1150310,- I'm not gonna be hurt either way.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1150310,1151590,I don't like relinquishing control.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1151590,1153230,"- Okay, good."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1153230,1155280,- But I gotta stand up
KIDLu5pVoWM,1155280,1157880,for the KFC Chipotle burrito drumstick.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1157880,1159830,"- Okay, so all right, Moo-chelle. Come in."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1159830,1163265,"Now, again, Moo-chelle is a vegetarian"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1163265,1165500,"and actually doesn't have a functioning mouth,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1165500,1168150,so she will just point at the thing that she prefers.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1170250,1171880,- This has a got a farm animal in it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1171880,1173020,"Of course, I guess that same farm animal is over here."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1173020,1174700,"- Yeah, there's chicken in both of them."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1174700,1176623,- The bone of the farm animal is in that one.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1176624,1177810,"- This one does have actually cow in it, though."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1177810,1181473,"Barbacoa, but you know. Use your own judgment."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1183248,1184441,(bell ringing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1184441,1188597,- (laughs) The chicken parm moves on.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1188597,1191320,- I don't know how you feel about someone breaking a tie
KIDLu5pVoWM,1191320,1192965,without ever tasting it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1192965,1194275,(crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1194275,1195770,- Somebody had to do it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1195770,1197193,- Somebody had to do it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1198320,1201279,"Moo-chelle, again, you didn't fill out a bracket."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1201280,1204990,"Okay, good. All right, move on the chicken parm."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1204990,1206723,- Move on.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1207810,1209990,- That's the most sad that I've been
KIDLu5pVoWM,1209990,1211870,and I didn't think anything would make me sad today.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1211870,1212880,- I'm sorry.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1212880,1214610,(upbeat intense music)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1214610,1217760,"All right, this one's for all the savory marbles!"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1217760,1220320,"We've got the number four seed, grilled cheese ramen,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1220320,1224070,"competing with the number two seed, orange chicken parm."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1224070,1225399,"- Oh, gosh. Remember this?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1225400,1227720,We've been eating it throughout the whole.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1227720,1228809,"- [Rhett] And again, this is the real test."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1228810,1230970,Coming back to it again.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1230970,1234179,- [Link] And I wanna go back to both of these.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1234180,1235013,- Still good.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1235013,1236740,- I wanna go back.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1236740,1239070,"I wonder, has anybody nailed it so far?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1239070,1240320,Anybody in the room?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1240320,1241309,- Any perfect brackets?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1241310,1244690,"- [Stevie] Yes, there is someone and his name is Kevin."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1244690,1246379,"Oh, we have two. And Amy."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1246380,1247400,- What?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1247400,1249340,- [Stevie] I'll be less mad about Amy
KIDLu5pVoWM,1249340,1251033,and somehow mad about Kevin.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1251034,1251880,(Rhett laughs)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1251880,1254233,"- Come on, let Amy have it, Stevie."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1254233,1257193,"- [Stevie] Yeah, I said. I'm excited about Amy, but Kevin."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1257193,1259477,(crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1259477,1261670,- I've been totally converted on this one.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1261670,1264140,- [Link] The grilled cheese with the pork slab.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1264140,1265313,What do you call that?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1265313,1266146,- [Nicole] Chashu pork.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1266146,1270500,- Pork slab in the middle is just. (kissing fingers)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1270500,1274040,So nice. And you can make it spicy.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1274040,1274890,- [Nicole] Of course.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1274890,1275820,- This one's not spicy.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1275820,1277479,"- But you could. If you wanted to, you could."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1277479,1279340,- How would you make it spicy?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1279340,1280939,- Put some spice. - And still grilled cheesy?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1280939,1282320,"- [Nicole] What Rhett said, yeah."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1282320,1284341,"- Yeah, you just put some spice in there."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1284341,1286350,Could you do a cooking lesson with Link
KIDLu5pVoWM,1286350,1287183,on how to make things spicy?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1287183,1289170,- [Nicole] That would be so funny.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1289170,1292230,"- It's like, man. Christy, today, you know what I learned?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1292230,1293570,I learned how they make things spicy.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1293570,1295112,- You add spice to stuff. - They do it with spice.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1295113,1296770,"- You add spice to stuff, to something,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1296770,1297810,and it makes it spicy.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1297810,1299170,"- Now, I've been converted on this,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1299170,1301410,"but I was already a member of this religion, okay?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1301410,1303430,"I was already a member of the chicken parm cult,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1303430,1305980,so this is not over by any means.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1305980,1309653,- It's fried. It's draped in cheese.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1309653,1311409,- This is so difficult for me.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1311410,1313190,- [Link] It's got that orange chicken goodness.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1313190,1316230,"- First of all, let me just say, I feel so strongly"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1316230,1317790,about these two being in the final.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1317790,1319860,Having tasted all eight.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1319860,1320693,- [Link] Yeah.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1320693,1322630,- I could keep coming back to one of these.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1322630,1326860,"It's not just a side, but I can't decide."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1326860,1328520,- I'm gonna have to go with which one's more healthy.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1328520,1329591,"- [Rhett] Well, hold on."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1329591,1330700,(Link laughing and blowing a raspberry)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1330700,1332010,"So do you wanna do a three, two, one"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1332010,1333900,and put your hand over the one that you think is better?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1333900,1334733,- Yeah.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1334733,1336390,- Because so we don't influence each other.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1336390,1338150,I've tasted both of them.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1338150,1339660,"- [Stevie] Am I allowed to give the three, two, one"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1339660,1340990,or am I compromised?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1340990,1342240,"- You can do the three, two, one,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1342240,1344070,as long as you don't do it in a suggestive way.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1344070,1346070,(Stevie and crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1346070,1349480,"- If it's not like, grilled cheese ramen,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1349480,1351200,"grilled cheese ramen, grilled cheese ramen."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1351200,1352240,"- [Rhett] Right, right, right, right."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1352240,1354153,"- [Stevie] Three, two, one."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1355153,1358347,(Rhett yelling)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1358348,1361007,"- We got! Oh, shoot, man!"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1361007,1363980,We flipped the script! (yells)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1363980,1366280,- Why did you go that way? I'm surprised.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1366280,1368910,"- Listen, I tried to taste both of them,"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1368910,1371610,but the beauty of this one keeps overwhelming me.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1371610,1375220,"I love this one, but I've grown to love this one"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1375220,1377480,and it kinda surpassed.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1377480,1380380,Are we gonna have to bring a cow that can't taste
KIDLu5pVoWM,1380380,1382340,in to make this decision?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1382340,1383344,It just seems poetic.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1383344,1385343,- I was teetering so much.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1385343,1389614,It was almost like a muscle flick.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1389614,1391960,"Oh, my muscle flicked this way"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1391960,1393700,and it could've flicked that way.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1393700,1395502,"And so, I'm wondering if I should change my answer."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1395503,1397753,"- Okay, you wanna do another three, two, one?"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1398776,1400280,And just go with your soul this time?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1400280,1404660,- I just love the fact this is a complete experience. Okay.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1404660,1406020,- Do it again.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1406020,1408003,"- [Stevie] Three, two, one."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1409241,1411908,(crew laughing)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1413380,1414323,- Look. Hey.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1415630,1417573,Look. Moo-chelle's over here.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1419760,1420720,- I can live with it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1420720,1424750,"I think they're absolutely, completely tied."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1424750,1426160,But only one can move forward
KIDLu5pVoWM,1426160,1429650,and I'll let a mute cow make the decision.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1429650,1434203,- So there it is! Our Lord and Savor.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1435410,1437210,"- Put it right under here. Oh, look."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1438110,1440872,This is as close as we can get to a halo.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1440872,1442250,(Link singing a single note)
KIDLu5pVoWM,1442250,1445310,- Orange chicken parm is the best savory dish
KIDLu5pVoWM,1445310,1448200,in the history of Good Mythical Morning!
KIDLu5pVoWM,1448200,1449092,Let's see it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1449950,1452460,- [Link] Move it on. Move it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1452460,1454669,"- Oh, it's beautiful. It's beautiful."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1454670,1456711,"Listen, I don't feel bad at all about that."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1456711,1457544,"- No, no, no, no, no."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1457544,1458377,- [Stevie] I will tell you
KIDLu5pVoWM,1458377,1460752,that zero Mythical crew members won today.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1460753,1462580,"- (laughs) Wow, you guys had ramen"
KIDLu5pVoWM,1462580,1463590,going all the way to the end?
KIDLu5pVoWM,1463590,1465017,"Wow, that's crazy. - That's cool."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1465017,1466423,It's anybody's game going into tomorrow and come back

KIDLu5pVoWM,1474453,1475286,- Give me.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1475286,1476465,- I'm Sanna. - And I'm Ryan.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1476465,1478520,"- And we're in West Lafayette, Indiana."
KIDLu5pVoWM,1478520,1480220,- Eating our orange chicken parm.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1480220,1483143,- [Both] And it's time to spin the Wheel of Mythicality.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1483144,1484073,Dink it.
KIDLu5pVoWM,1487230,1488510,- What are the chances?
