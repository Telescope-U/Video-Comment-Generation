zVTOCl4fe-Y,36719,42079,hey guys welcome back to my channel  today i'm jumping straight on into the  cleaning and all the stuff i'm showing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,42079,48559,you right now is all the messes in my  front entryway because that's where i am  starting i'm going to do my house from
zVTOCl4fe-Y,48559,54960,front to back that way i can get as much  cleaning motivation packed into this  video as i possibly can for you guys
zVTOCl4fe-Y,54960,60640,first things first i'm just taking one  of my extended swiffers and i'm gonna  get all the dust and cobwebs and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,60640,67760,everything out of these corners and away  from that front window because i'm going  to clean that front window with a  swiffer stick and yes as you can tell
zVTOCl4fe-Y,67760,73520,you can use 360 and just normal dusters  on this stick and it all works just the  same
zVTOCl4fe-Y,73520,79119,and then any glass or stainless steel  throughout this video will be done with  the method glass cleaner if you have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,79119,86400,very tall windows or anything like that  in your house and you struggle to reach  them or you struggle to do your bathroom  mirrors try putting a microfiber on your
zVTOCl4fe-Y,86400,94099,swiffer it is a fantastic trick  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,96400,109200,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,109200,116719,one of my absolute favorite products is  a magic eraser i don't care if it's  store brand dollar tree mr clean himself
zVTOCl4fe-Y,116719,122719,i don't care these things are fantastic  i use them to clean my doors spots on my  walls i'm gonna use the light switches
zVTOCl4fe-Y,122719,128800,here in a minute use it on that to clean  those i even use it on the front entry  table because it's white and it attracts
zVTOCl4fe-Y,128800,134560,so much dirt and there's always sticky  stuff on it and the match eraser is the  fastest and the best way i've found to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,134560,136959,clean it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,139920,148990,i  think all these years  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,151050,159729,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,159760,164879,just wanna get to know you  i don't  know you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,164879,178159,but i  want to  get to know you  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,180000,189220,just wanna get to know you  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,190080,194680,just wanna get to know you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,198800,205280,now moving into the kids bathroom they  have thoroughly destroyed this thing as  you can tell declan he still doesn't
zVTOCl4fe-Y,205280,210560,understand the concept of you know one  two three squares of toilet paper will  do you no he'll use half a roll at one
zVTOCl4fe-Y,210560,216080,time and then just leave it dangling  like that and i don't know who the lazy  person was that decided instead of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,216080,221440,changing the role they were gonna have  two rolls of toilet paper just sitting  there ready to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,224959,230799,in your go  no i am not the same everything has
zVTOCl4fe-Y,230799,237680,changed every day  my kids refuse to change the toilet
zVTOCl4fe-Y,237680,243439,paper roll i don't understand why it's  very easy i've showed them how to do it  a thousand times but yet they refuse to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,243439,249439,do it every single time and while i'm  over here what i'm also going to do that  hand soap on the counter is just like a
zVTOCl4fe-Y,249439,254959,generic any time of the year soap so i'm  gonna switch it out for one the ones i  bought that was specific for summer i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,254959,260160,think this is the pineapple coconut or  something like that i can't remember  right now when i'm back editing this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,260160,272639,but it smells amazing in there  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,272639,280450,these are the two cleaners i'll be using  in the bathroom one obviously for the  toilet and then a kaboom for the entire  vanity area
zVTOCl4fe-Y,280450,295040,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,295040,301360,everything has changed every day  the kids bathroom it's pretty small so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,301360,307039,it's always a pretty quick clean when  i'm in here sometimes i'll go a little  bit deeper bring out the scrub brush and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,307039,312160,scrub underneath the faucet head because  that gets really nasty but otherwise the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,312160,317840,sink itself doesn't get too gross the  countertop doesn't get really nasty it's  mostly the toilet and the shower and the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,317840,324000,way that shower is in there it's got  this little lip around the bottom  between the wall and the tub itself that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,324000,331680,gets a lot of the black mold if i'm not  very careful but otherwise this bathroom  is pretty much a quick clean and i'm not
zVTOCl4fe-Y,331680,337520,one of those people  that  i don't mind cleaning i really don't  even mind the deep cleaning because to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,337520,342639,me i want the clean house i want the  clean space so i'm fine with putting in
zVTOCl4fe-Y,342639,348479,the little extra work to get that so  that way i have a clear head and i'm not  worried about all the germs and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,348479,353840,everything being everywhere and all the  chaos and clutter so cleaning doesn't  really bother me
zVTOCl4fe-Y,353840,361720,but cleaning a toilet  i hate it i don't know why it is my most  hated chore
zVTOCl4fe-Y,365220,371350,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,372720,380840,every day  yeah every day
zVTOCl4fe-Y,382860,391840,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,391840,395800,never up never down
zVTOCl4fe-Y,398800,404080,i really don't know i don't understand  why that is my most hated chore i mean  you would think dishes because you do
zVTOCl4fe-Y,404080,410319,them all the time or laundry because  there's always so much of it especially  for a family our size but no  it's just the toilet for me i don't get
zVTOCl4fe-Y,410319,413319,it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,416170,419290,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,423300,428560,[Music]  this wall flower scent i bought last
zVTOCl4fe-Y,428560,435520,summer and i bought the candle for that  last summer it is so nice and it's like  it's very strong but not in a bad way
zVTOCl4fe-Y,435520,441520,just i love them both but i can't leave  the candle in the bathroom because of  the kids so my only option really is the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,441520,449050,wallflower  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,449360,456400,i'm gonna go ahead and vacuum in here  but i'm not gonna do the floors in here  until i do all of the tile later on in
zVTOCl4fe-Y,456400,461680,this video you'll see that and then when  i walked out of the bathroom to go turn  the camera off that's when i saw the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,461680,468680,little red mark on my wall right there  so i will also be tackling that in just  a minute
zVTOCl4fe-Y,470430,479268,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,486540,491400,[Music]  oh
zVTOCl4fe-Y,492570,500879,[Music]  [Applause]  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,504160,509600,again  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,511039,516159,front entryways done table doors window  all that that's the bathroom door we
zVTOCl4fe-Y,516159,521599,finished that that is the boys room that  they handle and that is tristan's room
zVTOCl4fe-Y,521599,527600,he handles on his own the only thing  left in this area i have to find more of  the dirty clothes i have to start the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,527600,532800,rugs because i have them from both  bathrooms that is waiting there until i  clean the other bathroom
zVTOCl4fe-Y,532800,540000,so this area is already clean oh  whichever subscriber told me  to put my dryer balls in a bag thank you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,540000,546399,so much i no longer have to chase these  around it's so time like save so much  time i love it but that's the next thing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,546399,554320,on the agenda i'm going to start those  rugs and whatever towels i find and then  head into there to the girls disaster
zVTOCl4fe-Y,556800,563360,i've seen a lot of things recently and  one of my subscribers mentioned stop  using fabric softener and switch it to  white vinegar so that's what i'm doing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,563360,569680,but it's only been a few loads so i  can't really weigh in but there are a  lot of benefits to switching so if you  want to look that up it is definitely
zVTOCl4fe-Y,569680,575920,worth it to switch from fabric softener  to white vinegar  and this is the girls disaster and it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,575920,581040,was worse than this a couple days ago if  you can even imagine  but yeah this is the current state of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,581040,586080,the girls room that i'm going to help  them tackle because they will never get  this all done by themselves
zVTOCl4fe-Y,586080,592480,and just the night stand alone i'm not  even sure what half of that is i know  this front piece right here is pencil
zVTOCl4fe-Y,592480,598720,and that is some kind of soda that my  daughter spilled which lets me know that  light's been on for several several days
zVTOCl4fe-Y,598720,604000,so i did have to talk to brianna about  that and the scissors in her bed not  sure why i found scissors in her bed
zVTOCl4fe-Y,604000,611160,when i was making it but  that's also another random story for  this video
zVTOCl4fe-Y,612070,618150,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,618150,621340,[Applause]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,623200,630000,making bunk beds is such a struggle i  love them for the space saving that we  get in this room but just making these
zVTOCl4fe-Y,630000,636240,beds sucks and they're low profile bunk  beds so you have a little bit less space  in there so climbing in and trying to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,636240,641519,make this thing is just awful i actually  have to replace declan and aiden's bunk
zVTOCl4fe-Y,641519,646800,bed they've got a black metal like rod  bunk bed but we got a notice in the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,646800,652320,email that it's being recalled  so we have to find them a new one and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,652320,658640,i'm debating buying them black wood this  time instead for the sturdy but i  definitely won't be doing low profile
zVTOCl4fe-Y,658640,664640,like the girls have the only reason is  because gwen was so young when we bought  this  otherwise i would rather have a normal
zVTOCl4fe-Y,664640,670560,sized bunk bed because then you have the  storage underneath and then over to the  nightstand match eraser again and it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,670560,676240,took every bit of this off with no  effort just make sure you're wetting  your magic eraser and that you have some
zVTOCl4fe-Y,676240,681519,kind of rag to go behind it and pick up  any of the residue or the wetness that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,681519,687200,way it actually does its job fully and  you don't have any leftover color or  nothing like that like even you see that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,687200,693200,green spot right there i don't know what  that was but when i first tried to get  it off it came off but it left a little
zVTOCl4fe-Y,693200,699519,bit of green on the actual white but the  more i sat here and scrubbed at it for  just a second or two even the green
zVTOCl4fe-Y,699519,703639,stain was gone
zVTOCl4fe-Y,706070,715710,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,716560,724279,talk to me baby i've been waiting for a  lifetime just keep on  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,724279,728519,fading the memories
zVTOCl4fe-Y,729670,732760,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,735760,742720,[Music]  over here on this side of the room is  all of the random toys the kitchen stuff
zVTOCl4fe-Y,742720,748639,the vanity stuff even brianna's skates  were over here she had a backpack over  here still the potty
zVTOCl4fe-Y,748639,753839,you name it it was just a mess and there  was plenty of room in the closet they do  have baskets in their closet for
zVTOCl4fe-Y,753839,758950,organization so that's where the  majority of this stuff ended up
zVTOCl4fe-Y,758950,782000,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,782000,787600,you know the drama  is never ending
zVTOCl4fe-Y,787600,793980,and of course the puppy had to come in  and say hi to us and get in the way a  little bit  while we were still trying to organize
zVTOCl4fe-Y,793980,800930,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,804360,812560,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,812560,818560,when you  i'm a sucker for vacuum lines to me that  is like the final step that says this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,818560,823680,room is clean between the fresh smell  and the vacuum lines the girls room
zVTOCl4fe-Y,823680,831279,isn't quite giving it to me anymore  which tells me it is time to break out  the carpet cleaner but our carpet  cleaner kind of took a crap so i do need
zVTOCl4fe-Y,831279,838000,recommendations for a good carpet  cleaner because i need and that will  handle pet hair we do have three pets in
zVTOCl4fe-Y,838000,843040,the house so that would also be a good  added bonus if it's made for a home with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,843040,853839,pet hair  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,853839,860639,i told brianna to pick a room spray she  wanted peppermint i'm like okay well  this week is six months till christmas
zVTOCl4fe-Y,860639,865680,so i guess it fits but i really don't  know why she picked a christmas
zVTOCl4fe-Y,866199,892919,smell apart  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,893199,899639,when you are under the weather getting  caught in the storm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,900190,905440,[Music]  for anyone curious what my current  laundry products are is basically just a
zVTOCl4fe-Y,905440,911360,tide pod and some of the unstoppables  and of course i'm adding the white  vinegar not to every load but definitely
zVTOCl4fe-Y,911360,917760,to the towels and any kind of linen and  a toy right here in the laundry that's  just my life but that is what i'm

zVTOCl4fe-Y,968880,976079,yes i'll be spending the entire day  cleaning but it is off and on and it is  sporadic and i will maybe spend a total
zVTOCl4fe-Y,976079,982240,of maybe two and a half to three hours  depending on how deep i want to clean  but i'm not spending my entire day
zVTOCl4fe-Y,982240,987620,cleaning it will look like that in the  footage to you guys but that's not how  it is

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1104320,1109679,while i was doing all the dishes this is  what these two we're doing just  snuggling on the couch under a blanket
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1109679,1116240,and i'm gonna mop my cabinets and a lot  of people have been asking me for  clarification on what i use to mop my  cabinets for one i do have a brand new
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1116240,1122720,head that i use that's four cabinets  only i put it on when i'm going to start  and i take it off as soon as i'm done
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1122720,1128160,hot water about a gallon one tide pod  and five to six squirts of the power
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1128160,1134559,wash that's literally all i use and i  make sure to mix it up really good with  the mop head to make sure the pod is
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1134559,1140160,dissolved before i start cleaning my  cabinets but you'll see here i'm  switching out the one that i typically
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1140160,1145360,use for my floor on the mop and then i  will put the one that is cabinet  specific only
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1145360,1149080,on it and get started
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1150740,1165520,[Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1194640,1201200,still working around all of it and being  involved in everything that i can so i  don't just spend all day cleaning my
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1201200,1207360,house i make sure to stop and do things  with the kids and put the cleaning on  the back burner especially summer when
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1207360,1212720,they're home with me i want to spend  more time with them i don't want to be  cleaning and doing everything i have to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1212720,1219520,do most of my dinners are either  fasteners or crock pots something like  that where we can do as much as we want
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1219520,1225440,to do while they're on vacation before  school goes back and we go back into  that full-blown chaos time of the year

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1258960,1265919,take out my little scraper scrape down  anything that's even remotely stuck on  there just give the counters a good deep
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1265919,1271520,clean and then put all of the items back  i was going to use antibacterial stuff  on the counters and i decided i just
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1271520,1279120,didn't feel like it so i'm just using  the rose mrs meyers but typically i will  use the method anti-back or mix up some
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1279120,1285520,lysol with water in a spray bottle mr  clean something anti-bacterial but today  i just didn't feel like it so mrs myers

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1351360,1356960,i'm gonna wipe everything down as i put  it back that way in case something is  stuck on the bottom that i just didn't
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1356960,1362080,notice  and while i'm putting my scentsy back  you'll see that i turn it on
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1362080,1367120,and when the knife block goes back i  don't know what happened but it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1367120,1372640,it blew just the bulb completely blew  right there as soon as i lifted up the  the rest of the cord
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1372640,1399160,it popped the bulb  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1400080,1405760,i love this tray in my kitchen we use it  multiple times every day but it does get
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1405760,1412559,really gross in here so i do have to  wipe this down pretty frequently but i  love having a functional piece of decor
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1412559,1417919,on my counter instead of it being  cluttered with just junk that you never  touch this thing gets used every day
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1417919,1424880,multiple times a day and i'm going to  deep clean the glass top i'm going to  use the scrub daddy power paste you guys  already know i love this product it is
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1424880,1429919,getting to the end of it so there is a  little bit more graininess to it it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1429919,1436240,takes a bit more effort to wipe it off  but i mean it's still worth it because  it's fantastic product and a smile face
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1436240,1441919,for you guys because i just had to but  i do like this product there's a lot of  people that think it's over hyped and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1441919,1448320,honestly in some cases it can be unless  you're going to use it in multiple  places not just your glass top i use it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1448320,1455360,in my glass top my stainless steel sink  and i've used it on my shower doors the  glass shower doors they are so easy to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1455360,1462640,clean with that product and it does a  fantastic job so if you're going to use  it all over then yes it's absolutely
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1462640,1467760,worth it if you're just going to use it  for one spot know you could find  something else that's easier
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1467760,1474320,and not ten dollars a jar you can buy  baking soda and dawn for your stainless  steel sink and it's so much cheaper and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1474320,1497840,does just as great of a job  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1497840,1504640,it can't be over  oh since i have the power paste out  anyways i'm going to scrub the stainless
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1504640,1510640,steel down as well just make sure when  you're scrubbing your sink if you have a  garbage disposal sink you want to get
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1510640,1517200,down there and clean that gasket up  underneath it because that's where a lot  of germs like if you have a smell coming
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1517200,1523360,from your sink nine times out of ten  it's that gasket and or your garbage  disposal so just make sure to clean that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1523360,1529919,part really really well and then my  faucet for some reason i think we have  like really hard water or something but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1529919,1536400,you can see how gross it gets underneath  my faucet head all the time it can be  three days and it will look like that so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1536400,1542640,i just use some power wash and a scrub  brush and clean it off  but i don't know if it's the faucet head
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1542640,1548960,or if it's our water or a combination of  the two but either way that thing always  looks like that and shoots funny and i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1548960,1554400,have to clean it very frequently and  since i switched out the soap in the  bathroom i'm gonna take the lemon out
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1554400,1561039,and i'm gonna put the firecracker one in  here for july because it's coming next  week but that way i've switched out both
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1561039,1564600,soaps for fun

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1914559,1920399,rare occasion instead of how frequently  i have to now and speaking of mopping  today's mopping i'm going to use the

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2259359,2264560,pile for trash and it cleaned up really  really quickly actually because the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2264560,2270359,majority of it was actually crap that  does go in that shopping cart

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2518240,2524800,it was fantastic is it 100 better no but  is it better than any product i've found
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2524800,2529839,so far for down there absolutely you do  have to wipe it off really well though
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2529839,2537838,to make sure you don't leave any of that  behind because bar keepers friend is one  of those things you do have to rinse off  but so good

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2616880,2623440,for a little while now i've been trying  out epsom salt in the bottom of my  toothbrush holder because it was  recommended a long time ago
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2623440,2628720,and it's not bad it does help keep the  inside the toothbrush holder clean it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2628720,2634640,does keep the inside of the toothbrush  holder clean a whole lot easier and you  don't have to use much this is a one
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2634640,2640160,pound bag and i've had it for a while  because you just need about half an inch  to an inch in the bottom of this thing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2640160,2647280,and that's it but i do have one problem  with it right here when your toothbrush  goes in there damp it hangs on so right
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2647280,2653280,at the end of your toothbrush there's  always just little bits of salt it's  just a nitpicky thing it does help but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2653280,2657240,that bothers me a little bit

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2817200,2823680,out into kids adults and towels and then  give my older kids their clothes and i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2823680,2829119,will fold mine my husbands declans  gwen's and any towels or linen i handle

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2853359,2858400,beach towels because that way in case  we're going to the pool or the beach or  whatever we're doing they don't come
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2858400,2863760,undone so that way i could just throw  them in the beach bag or throw them in  the back of my car or wherever we're
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2863760,2870079,using them and they stay more compact  and i don't have to worry about  unraveling and being a big giant mess
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2870079,2878480,my intention for this video was to give  you guys at least an hour if not an hour  and a half of straight brand new content
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2878480,2884240,of cleaning my house start to finish i  do not know how i only managed to get 49

zVTOCl4fe-Y,3442720,3448480,from sam's they're non-breakable my kids  have been taking my mason jars and just  kind of cracking them and everything so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3448480,3453520,i'm not dealing with that anymore i got  them plastic and clear plastic because  they will leave drinks with like this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3453520,3459599,much sitting in them on the counter  because they just couldn't see how much  was left and they just kind of left them  so this way i can see and be like oh hey

zVTOCl4fe-Y,3513280,3518559,depends on the condition now obviously  if my house was a complete train wreck  like my kids do some days that ain't

zVTOCl4fe-Y,3573680,3581040,started i showed you guys months and  months ago that i did a calendar for the  month for groceries well around like
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3581040,3586160,february i kind of died off and i just  started picking it back up for last
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3586160,3591200,month and i'm going to show you the one  for this month and this is so easy for  grocery shopping literally you just go
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3591200,3596240,over and go off your list it's perfect  makes life so easy so i am going
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3596240,3602799,slightly themed but this is for the  month this is the week i am shopping for  so i know exactly how much chicken i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3602799,3608160,have to buy for the entire month and  everything it just makes it so much  easier we are currently unloading and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3608160,3617359,then i'll show you everything we got but  i was gonna film in the stores it was  chaos so that definitely didn't happen  this is a mixture from walmart and sam's
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3617359,3623040,and then back there i've got five below  and that is just a few things from  marshalls i'll show you that in a minute
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3623040,3628720,let's just run down  some pirate booty some of that this  right here goes that big old bag of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3628720,3636079,chips pretzels things like that  all of this is for dinners this week  we're going to do fajitas sheet pan
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3636079,3642400,this is for a ham and potato soup we  have breakfast for dinner one night that  back there is for shepherd's pie
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3642400,3647599,things like that and then some more  cereal oh and we're also having a  breakfast dinner right now pancakes with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3647599,3654000,that  i need more of this because it's just  delicious  and then a few little snacks these are
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3654000,3659520,for reese's cup s'mores if you haven't  tried that so good but this is the place  of the chocolate
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3659520,3666240,i need more tide pods more milk like  always  sam's was completely out of chicken none
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3666240,3672240,whatsoever so i had to buy these at  walmart i'm gonna separate these out for  the freezer and i have beef behind me
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3672240,3677680,clothes are always great at sam's  they're good quality and ridiculously  cheap so each kid got like an active
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3677680,3683839,wear shorts set in there  and then five below is just random junk
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3683839,3690160,like more coloring books and things like  that so  that's all that that is
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3690319,3695920,okay  my fruit containers broke so just fyi  marshals and tj maxx are a good place to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3695920,3701839,get those and they are fantastic  continuing with sam's my husband picked  up this big old thing a tater tots and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3701839,3707359,waffle fries because i picked up the  knock off of the chick-fil-a chicken  this stuff
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3707359,3712880,don't sleep on it it is amazing  and then hot dogs a big old bag of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3712880,3718319,frozen fruit for smoothies here is our  meat  for our beef mexican cheese because we
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3718319,3724319,have to pizza rolls more sealed declan  pick that one and then these reheat so  well so we got those for lunches for the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3724319,3730480,kids that's gonna do as far as all the  grocery haul goes i'm gonna go ahead and  put this stuff away the baby just laid
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3730480,3736480,down for a nap we were gonna go to the  pool and it just started raining so i'm  not really sure what's next probably
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3736480,3741680,some cleaning i always get asked how we  save money on meat for a family our size
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3741680,3748480,and i always buy our meat in bulk  typically at sam's i buy the big huge  pack of chicken that i can get three
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3748480,3754720,meals out of these i can only get two  for each one  but still it's a lot cheaper 1.99 a
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3754720,3759760,pound versus 3.99 a pound  for the smaller pack so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3759760,3765280,this is one way and then we made the  investment for the foodsaver  best thing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3765280,3772160,in the world it has saved us so much  money in the long run it even came with  bags so i have yet to have to buy bags
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3772160,3777599,because hang on  it also came with a roll which i haven't
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3777599,3783119,touched yet either so it comes with  what you need for a little while
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3783119,3790480,and then they do sell this piece on its  own so if you don't want to do this  whole thing you get one of these
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3790480,3796720,and buy the bags that have this thing on  it right here and you're good to go  before freezing most of the time i will
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3796720,3802240,cut this extra crap off but that's  mostly in winter because i use the crock  pot a lot and i will just take this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3802240,3807680,straight from the freezer and throw it  in the crock pot most of my chicken in  summer goes on the grill and gets thawed
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3807680,3822800,out so i'll just cut this off then  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3827839,3833920,so change of plans again the rain did  stop it's gone away for about two hours  so we are going to take the kids to the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3833920,3840480,pool and i want to show you guys a  really cool mom hack real fast my  toddlers hate having sunscreen put on
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3840480,3847440,their face  but i do it now with a foundation brush  i've done this for like two or three  summers now but it just helps so much
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3847440,3852480,with my kids not screaming at me  and i can't help but smile
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3852480,3858559,do you know how much i love you you put  my favorite song on
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3858559,3864000,i put my feet up  and we just sing along
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3864000,3873150,and i can't help but feeling  just loving  this moment can we stay here forever
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3873150,3876229,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3878940,3890079,[Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,4381920,4389120,learning books in it and one has all the  coloring books  now he's got to make sense of this mess
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4389120,4392409,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4395130,4398249,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4400500,4415399,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4417600,4423679,all right this is now done as i said the  games are just a mess i'm not worried  about that but then all of the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4423679,4430320,books and all the learning books and  coloring books and then down here it's  all of the crayons and stuff like that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4430320,4436239,paints play-doh bubbles  learning stuff  that won't fit down there in the cart
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4436239,4442880,that's got spare paper spare notebooks  all kinds of random school supplies  then this is like pens and scissors and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4442880,4448400,glue sticks and stuff and we have zero  pencils in the house so i have to fix  that when school supplies come back
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4448400,4455199,but  the closet is officially cleaned back up  while i was working on cleaning out that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4455199,4461679,little closet the doorbell rang and my  toaster was delivered we've been using a  broke toaster for more months than i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4461679,4468800,even close to proud of for a family our  size so i'm going to show you the broke  one and then unbox this here is our very
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4468800,4476080,used toaster it is not in good condition  whatsoever but we've had this thing for  years and it held up fantastic
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4476080,4482480,like it doesn't even have the crumb  catcher doors anymore they have gone who  knows where but this is why we had to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4482480,4488960,replace it let's even get to focus see  this bar  right here  well it's broken and bent down there in
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4488960,4494880,the bottom so you can't even use this  side so we don't use this side to light  that one so we've just been using the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4494880,4501120,two slice for months old faithful  looking all nasty
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4501120,4507360,same toaster just years later  but same toaster
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4507360,4512400,beautiful  and everything  where it's supposed to be declan saw a
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4512400,4518239,new toaster he wants toast but before i  even do that  i'm literally going to crank it up with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4518239,4525440,nothing in it  and just burn off any brand new plastic  or gross smell from being in a box
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4525440,4531920,the next thing we're going to work on is  my laundry room now we are still in the  works of updating this and completely
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4531920,4538719,changing it putting more shelves in and  all that  but i've been waiting and waiting and  waiting to clean all this up when we do
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4538719,4544320,that and it's taking too long to get to  that project on our list of house stuff  so i'm not waiting anymore i'm at least
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4544320,4550960,doing something to fix the chaos in here  here's a closer look at the mess that we  are dealing with and i still have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4550960,4556880,candles and decor back behind all those  bottles right there that's why they're  all pushed forward plus i'm too short so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4556880,4562880,i need them to be right on the edge or i  can't reach them  i am not even sure about what 75 of that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4562880,4569840,is in that bucket  and then there is no space up there  for any of this stuff so i have to make
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4569840,4575440,the space now  and i also use this rack right here just  to hang my laundry instead of taking it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4575440,4581520,in my room and hanging in the closet to  dry because i don't have a rack in here  i do plan on putting one either on this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4581520,4589560,wall or this wall over here that way  they can hang and not from the shelf but  i don't have that yet
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4591110,4613979,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4616960,4623840,you take me to paradise that's why it's  hard to wait
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4624690,4633320,[Music]  a simple question
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4644719,4648440,a simple question
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4652470,4672560,[Music]  is  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4672560,4678159,yeah i just need you too  i just need you to  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4678159,4713659,is  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4714239,4719920,now i'm going to move out into the  kitchen and dining room area clean up  the snack area where the kids just had  their toast because they want to try out
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4719920,4726198,the new toaster so bad and also work on  the stainless steel in here
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4726250,4742169,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4742880,4749610,and the thing is that these scarves are  scary but they are
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4749610,4755539,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4760080,4766239,everything just falls apart  so i'll just close my eyes and dream
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4766239,4771159,about  our kids
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4772820,4779120,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4779120,4785920,cleaning this just reminded me of a  question i had for you guys now if you  watch my recent videos you know that my
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4785920,4792000,tear tray over there worked  i don't really necessarily know if i  want to put another tiered tray out the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4792000,4798640,holidays are coming  soon i mean we're still a couple you  know two three months away before  decorating but i'm debating if instead
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4798640,4804640,of doing a tiered tray if i just want to  do like a tray  so okay over on my dining room table
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4804640,4810320,i'll show you but i don't know if i want  to do something like this  or a tear tray and also i don't even
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4810320,4816560,know if i want to keep things like this  sitting on my counter anymore because  they're just a clutter magnet but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4816560,4821760,something like this just a one tier tray  obviously with a few more things in it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4821760,4827679,than this but over in the kitchen  instead of a tiered tray but just let me  know what you think because i was
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4827679,4833440,looking back at some old pictures and  stuff the other day and i had two of  those cake stands on my counter and i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4833440,4839120,had flowers in the middle and my island  just looked so cluttered and i'm trying
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4839120,4844239,to figure out if maybe i shouldn't even  have one of those over there and just  put flowers in the middle and then like
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4844239,4886759,a tiered tray or a single tray in the  corner  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4891600,4897120,the cleaning portion is done now i'm  going to go ahead and move into dinner  real fast short and sweet just going to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4897120,4902159,show you guys the steps for a very easy  kid-friendly family-friendly summer
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4902159,4909360,dinner so don't worry it's going to be  short and sweet in case you want to  stick around for the recipe part as per  usual mine is doubled so just
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4909360,4916560,ignore  half of this  but you're going to need chicken any  kind breast tenders thighs your choice
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4916560,4922560,some garlic a lemon  half a stick of butter  one cup of broth and a little bit of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4922560,4929440,flour for your chicken salt and pepper  and that's it pat all your chicken dry a  little bit salt and pepper the chicken
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4929440,4934800,garlic powder the chicken and then  you're gonna dredge every bit of it in  the flour in case you know what i mean
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4934800,4940320,by dredge you take your chicken  put it in the flour pat it in flip it  over
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4940320,4946239,pat it some more just make sure the  whole thing is it in the flour like that  next thing skillet big enough for all of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4946239,4950960,your chicken  heat it to about medium high
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4951840,4957280,one tablespoon to two tablespoons  depending if you're doing as much  chicken as me and one to two tablespoons
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4957280,4962320,of butter depending again on how much  chicken you're doing  move all the butter and oil around and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4962320,4968800,then add all of your chicken  into  the pan i hate overcrowding a pan but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4968800,4974480,for this recipe i kind of have to  because i have to make a sauce in here  so i just need one pan and done
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4974480,4980159,cook your chicken about four to five  minutes on each side and then take it  out of the pan and remove any oil that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4980159,4985679,remains make sure your chicken is all  the way cooked before you remove from  the pan and then go ahead and zest your
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4985679,4991600,lemons in the pan with all the good  little brown bits you're going to want  two teaspoons of garlic for one round of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4991600,4998480,chicken  one cup of chicken broth for the one  round of chicken
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4998480,5003840,and then the juice of one normal size  lemon but because mine are massive
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5003840,5009199,it would only be half but i'm doubling  so it's one big lemon
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5009199,5014480,bring this to a simmer and let it simmer  for two to three minutes and then we'll  move on add half a teaspoon of the zest
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5014480,5020880,or one teaspoon if you're doing as much  chicken as i am  three tablespoons or six if you're doing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5020880,5026400,double like me  put the chicken
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5026400,5035040,back in the pan  coat the top of the chicken  in the sauce that's not submerged
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5035920,5041920,let it sit in there for like three or  four minutes and you're done  and there it is i'll plate it up i just
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5041920,5048719,did some rice pilaf and some steamed  broccoli  put a little piece of lemon on top and  drizzled some more of the sauce on but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5048719,5053840,there you go  all right but that's gonna do it for  this one thank you guys so much for  watching i hope it gave you tons of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5053840,5061280,motivation to get some random crap done  around your house because it's pretty  much what i did was all of the most  random projects in my house today but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5061280,5069400,again i appreciate you all so much give  this one a thumbs up if you enjoyed it  subscribe if you're not already and i'll  see in the next one
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5069420,5090560,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5090560,5096960,hey guys welcome back to my channel or  if you are new here my name is rachel  from rageplus5 today i am doing a get it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5096960,5102400,all done vlog i've got a whole bunch of  things just to knock off of my checklist  i'm going to bring you guys along with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5102400,5108560,me if that sounds like something you'd  like don't forget to hit that subscribe  button stick around and let's get  started before i start actually going
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5108560,5115440,through the checklist and showing you  guys what we're going to be doing i have  switched over recently i haven't really  been liking my iced coffee so i've been
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5115440,5121679,switching over to iced chai lattes like  starbucks and the kitties come say hello
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5121679,5127280,hi guys  so i'm gonna show you how to do that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5127280,5133440,having her water  will i make my tea  i showed this back in fall but if you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5133440,5138800,like the iced chai lattes from starbucks  it is literally just a concentrate for
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5138800,5146159,chai latte this is the brand that they  supposedly use and this one is delicious  and two percent milk that's literally it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5146159,5152560,with ice  according to online you can use the  markings on the cup for the grande one
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5152560,5160320,this is obviously bigger than the grande  so the lines aren't gonna match but i'll  show you the picture in a second  but literally it just says four pumps
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5160320,5166000,which is equivalent to a third of a cup  in so you see it doesn't match my lines
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5166000,5171520,one cup of the milk  which actually does take it to the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5171520,5177679,second line and then ice  and then i put my ice to where the  liquid comes to that top line
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5177679,5183760,and then just throw my straw in there  mix it around and i'm good and then i  can always add more if i want to fill
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5183760,5189600,the whole cup it's just however you want  to do it but that's the good part about  doing it at home if you want a stronger  chai flavor just use more of the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5189600,5195679,concentrate these boxes are only like  three dollars at target and i've used  this the entire week and i still have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5195679,5201920,about to there in the box  so they last you a while and it's a lot  cheaper doing it this way you guys have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5201920,5209520,been around for a while you know i am a  sucker for a checklist so  here is what i'll be handling today and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5209520,5215199,this one's at the bottom list just in  case i get a hold of it and i just found  something else to add to the list
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5215199,5221840,not sure why but last night at like 10  30 i was cleaning out closets and  shredding paperwork so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5221840,5226880,i have to clean this mess up and the  reason i have to work on the living room
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5226880,5232280,is because my daughter decided to play  with all of the pet toys so that's on  the list
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5232280,5243919,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5249120,5253709,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5256719,5262239,they hear that that's what she wants and  she heard it while i was cleaning up
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5262560,5267600,in my last video i talked about my couch  and about how gross and nasty it gets
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5267600,5272719,and that i bought a steamer for one i  bought the steamer on extreme sell  because of all the stores competing with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5272719,5279600,prime day deals so i got that sucker for  like half off so yes of course i bought  it for two you spend quite a lot of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5279600,5285280,money on your couches  so we should take better care of them  this is how i'm justifying buying that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5285280,5293360,steamer  my couch is just slightly over a year  old and look at all of the crap on it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5293360,5301280,from having my kids i mean there's five  kids that use this plus my husband and  myself the dog the cat everybody so this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5301280,5306320,drives me nuts and i'm gonna fix that  so let's just give this thing one real
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5306320,5311520,good before shot  there is all of the grossness
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5311520,5317280,here is my new little monster i can't  show you the actual front because that's  really stuck the packing label with my
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5317280,5323110,name and everything so  but here is what it is
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5323110,5356719,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5356719,5364479,so  [Music]  [Applause]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5369250,5390329,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5390719,5397120,this thing is stupid easy to use but i  gotta get her out of my way clean the  rest of the couch and then i'll check  back in i did
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5397120,5403679,just this one half over here but i mean  you can already see a big difference but  i want this to dry so i can see what it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5403679,5410239,looks like compared to that but one  thing i will note i've used almost the  entire clean tank
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5410239,5416080,and that's just nasty  just the one half  look at the color
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5416080,5422880,of that  just absolutely disgusting so yeah think  your couch isn't dirty find out i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5422880,5429199,still waiting for the couch to dry so  what i'm going to go ahead and do is put  dinner in the crock pot and i'm going to  share it with you guys it's cracked
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5429199,5436560,chicken if you've ever had it it is  amazing it's not the most healthy recipe  but it is super easy and very delicious
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5436560,5442800,one note i don't always use these liners  but i will use it if it's something i  know is gonna really really stick to my
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5442800,5449280,crock pot i'm just not gonna deal with  it and i'm gonna use a liner but that's  up to you  in there i've got
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5449280,5455679,three chicken breasts yes they are  frozen  either way thawed frozen your choice bag  of ranch
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5455679,5462760,a block of cream cheese i do it in cubes  just because you want to get it all over  in there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5463440,5468560,lid on  low for six high for four
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5468560,5474480,moving on to the next item on the  checklist and that was the new pot if  you saw one of my former videos i was
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5474480,5479760,talking about the warranty claim on our  pots because they claim to be dishwasher  safe and they definitely weren't i have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5479760,5485760,them sitting right here this is what  it's supposed to look like  this is what it looked like after just  two rounds in the dishwasher and there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5485760,5491040,is one in between that's even you know a  mix of the two that was in there once
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5491040,5497199,but it claimed it it wasn't i handled  the warranty claim and what we got as a  replacement were these
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5497199,5503520,so they told me i can keep these trash  these donate these do what i want with  them so now i have to clean all the new
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5503520,5508719,pots and figure out what i'm keeping  what i'm getting rid of and the whole  nine yards i don't
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5508719,5514880,necessarily have to throw any of the  pots out or donate them because they  still cook well they're just not
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5514880,5522000,pleasing to look at and definitely  cannot be thrown in that dishwasher  again  so i mean now i just got a side and also
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5522000,5527360,that is not the same brand of pots  because we were worried  that if there is something wrong with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5527360,5534400,these you know the same set would be the  same issue so we did go with a fully  different brand i do have space up there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5534400,5541760,for the new lids so that's not a problem  but down here i could probably stack the  new big one with this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5541760,5549920,but there's not a whole lot of space  here because i bought this separate  really large skillet for my family which  this brand is the new brand up there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5549920,5557040,this one not these  and then this is the really bad  dishwasher pan  this one is second
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5557040,5563360,and that one is awful so i really don't  know what stays and what goes so  basically what i decided to do i'm going
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5563360,5570080,to keep the old set back there just in  case there's a problem with the new pans  it's very rare but it still can be i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5570080,5575120,going to put the new lids up there stack  the new big pan inside that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5575120,5583400,and then just put all the other new ones  over here where the old ones were  no clue where i'm storing this now
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5584900,5590080,[Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5666080,5672880,usual my kids like to give me an extra  mess when i've already cleaned the mess  so all these little toys have just been

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5727920,5735199,just buy some stuff throw it up there  and then kind of forget that i bought it  none of this is old none of it's  outdated it's just was too much of a
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5735199,5740320,cluster and now i do have to organize  what's going on  but if you are you know a festive person

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5754239,5760480,bag i found this at aldi for like four  dollars and change i've seen it at five  below  but yeah if you want to be a little
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5760480,5765840,extra patriotic with your kids they have  that too  this right here has just put a huge
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5765840,5773440,damper on cleaning the playhouse it's  around this corner i'm not even going in  there i'll show you from the window but  yeah huge downpour this thing right here

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5780560,5787679,water table sand table little combo but  i have to fix the pavilion because the  wind has been messing it up and i have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5787679,5794520,to clean all of that but yeah that's off  the agenda today
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5801520,5807119,i keep on telling lies  that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5808070,5817200,[Music]  you know that i is mind about what is
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5817200,5833360,[Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5848639,5854239,here's  before  and then these are the ones i did that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5854239,5859440,are dry  so you can really see a difference you  can see the lines still in it so i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5859440,5865280,assuming if i vacuum it that will  correct itself  but those four cushions and those two
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5865280,5870719,big cushions have been  cleaned so yeah huge difference between
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5870719,5877199,the two  and that part of the couch is done and  then i redid this bottom part to see if
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5877199,5883199,i can get the lines out of it fans going  so  right now it looks fantastic
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5883199,5888880,and that is gross nasty tank number two  absolutely disgusting gonna move on to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5888880,5894080,the dessert so that way it's ready for  tonight and i'm making a very simple  banana pudding i'm not doing anything
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5894080,5899119,too elaborate this is just the way my  mom used to do it when i was growing up  and it is just the instant vanilla
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5899119,5906080,pudding bananas and vanilla wafers  really really simple i only cut up one  banana at a time my kids like them very
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5906080,5911520,very thin  and then you're going to need four cups  of milk for two boxes of this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5911520,5916719,beat it for about two minutes maybe  three  and then i typically use a glass bowl
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5916719,5922000,but for right now just with the kids i'm  gonna use this plastic one and then  you're gonna layer cookies in the bottom
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5922000,5928960,layer bananas put some of the pudding  and keep going until you just run out of  stuff see there's layer one of cookies
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5928960,5936080,and bananas  there's the second layer of cookies and  bananas on top of the pudding and there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5936080,5943360,is the last layer of bananas and cookies  and just the right amount of pudding to  cover it there's the pudding
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5943360,5948639,can't really see the layers from the  side like that but  it will just get the lid and go in the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5948639,5953840,fridge for at least an hour but you know  two or three is best
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5953990,5960179,[Music]  [Applause]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5961750,5983919,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5984560,5990639,i love it it looks so much better that  little machine is super easy the actual  cleaning time was less than half an hour
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5990639,5997840,the drying time took longer than that  but still so easy and to get the whole  couch clean and looking like that i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5997840,6003280,haven't seen it look like that since it  was maybe a month or two old and then  the pillow covers back there they're
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6003280,6010400,covering those old nasty white and gray  ones that have been sitting on my couch  those are just some pillow covers i  found it was a pack of two for 7.99 on
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6010400,6017760,amazon now i will say the pack of 2 is  actually 9.99  but there is a 20 off coupon which makes
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6017760,6024480,it 7.99 and there are tons of different  colors there was a navy blue i almost  went with there's a yellow a pink you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6024480,6031440,name it but you all know me with buffalo  check so of course i had to make summer  colors work for that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6035119,6041820,to be too and baby dance the night away  i let my head down if i won
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6041820,6046880,[Music]  don't you just get tired chasing fame

zVTOCl4fe-Y,6080560,6087040,back to the dinner the chicken is cooked  all the way through i took it out and  you can shred it with a fork but i am
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6087040,6092080,way too lazy for that  and this is much faster
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6092080,6096280,let yourself be free
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6097370,6100460,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6110060,6113709,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6116639,6122239,20 second video  three chicken breasts yep mix the  chicken back into the cream cheese it's
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6122239,6127920,in there take some real bacon pieces  this is a 2.5 ounce bag
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6127920,6133199,it says choose the whole thing but use  it at your discretion or you can also  use bacon that you cook and crumble
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6133199,6140320,yourself  and then you need to use a two cup bag  of cheddar i don't have cheddar so i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6140320,6146639,using mexican style but  i mean you could do this any way you  want  but just give it a good mix and then put
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6146639,6151679,your lid back on cook it for another 10  to 15 minutes and then serve it up we
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6151679,6156800,are serving ours up on hamburger buns  tonight and doing cracked chicken
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6156800,6162400,sandwiches  but you don't have to make sandwiches  out of this you can put it over rice
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6162400,6168400,over mashed potatoes i've done it even  with adding pasta to it but when i do  that i do recommend you adding a little
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6168400,6176239,more liquid to it i breathe  some kind of chicken stock or some kind  of even milk will help but it will dry
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6176239,6181679,it out really bad if you don't add some  more liquid if you are putting this with  pasta dinner is done and there is not
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6181679,6188800,much cleanup thanks to that liner but  like i said earlier you don't have to  use those if you don't want the extra  plastic or waste in your life just skip
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6188800,6194159,it you don't have to use those it's just  a preference i do when i know  something's going to really badly stick
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6194159,6201280,and going to be really hard to clean  other than that i don't have much left  to do the only thing i didn't get to on  my checklist was the guest bathroom but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6201280,6206719,i will handle that tomorrow for right  now i am going to go ahead and say  goodnight take care of my kids get them

zVTOCl4fe-Y,36719,42079,hey guys welcome back to my channel  today i'm jumping straight on into the  cleaning and all the stuff i'm showing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,42079,48559,you right now is all the messes in my  front entryway because that's where i am  starting i'm going to do my house from
zVTOCl4fe-Y,48559,54960,front to back that way i can get as much  cleaning motivation packed into this  video as i possibly can for you guys
zVTOCl4fe-Y,54960,60640,first things first i'm just taking one  of my extended swiffers and i'm gonna  get all the dust and cobwebs and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,60640,67760,everything out of these corners and away  from that front window because i'm going  to clean that front window with a  swiffer stick and yes as you can tell
zVTOCl4fe-Y,67760,73520,you can use 360 and just normal dusters  on this stick and it all works just the  same
zVTOCl4fe-Y,73520,79119,and then any glass or stainless steel  throughout this video will be done with  the method glass cleaner if you have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,79119,86400,very tall windows or anything like that  in your house and you struggle to reach  them or you struggle to do your bathroom  mirrors try putting a microfiber on your
zVTOCl4fe-Y,86400,94099,swiffer it is a fantastic trick  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,96400,109200,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,109200,116719,one of my absolute favorite products is  a magic eraser i don't care if it's  store brand dollar tree mr clean himself
zVTOCl4fe-Y,116719,122719,i don't care these things are fantastic  i use them to clean my doors spots on my  walls i'm gonna use the light switches
zVTOCl4fe-Y,122719,128800,here in a minute use it on that to clean  those i even use it on the front entry  table because it's white and it attracts
zVTOCl4fe-Y,128800,134560,so much dirt and there's always sticky  stuff on it and the match eraser is the  fastest and the best way i've found to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,134560,136959,clean it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,139920,148990,i  think all these years  [Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,190080,194680,just wanna get to know you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,198800,205280,now moving into the kids bathroom they  have thoroughly destroyed this thing as  you can tell declan he still doesn't
zVTOCl4fe-Y,205280,210560,understand the concept of you know one  two three squares of toilet paper will  do you no he'll use half a roll at one
zVTOCl4fe-Y,210560,216080,time and then just leave it dangling  like that and i don't know who the lazy  person was that decided instead of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,216080,221440,changing the role they were gonna have  two rolls of toilet paper just sitting  there ready to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,224959,230799,in your go  no i am not the same everything has
zVTOCl4fe-Y,230799,237680,changed every day  my kids refuse to change the toilet
zVTOCl4fe-Y,237680,243439,paper roll i don't understand why it's  very easy i've showed them how to do it  a thousand times but yet they refuse to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,243439,249439,do it every single time and while i'm  over here what i'm also going to do that  hand soap on the counter is just like a
zVTOCl4fe-Y,249439,254959,generic any time of the year soap so i'm  gonna switch it out for one the ones i  bought that was specific for summer i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,254959,260160,think this is the pineapple coconut or  something like that i can't remember  right now when i'm back editing this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,260160,272639,but it smells amazing in there  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,272639,280450,these are the two cleaners i'll be using  in the bathroom one obviously for the  toilet and then a kaboom for the entire  vanity area
zVTOCl4fe-Y,280450,295040,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,295040,301360,everything has changed every day  the kids bathroom it's pretty small so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,301360,307039,it's always a pretty quick clean when  i'm in here sometimes i'll go a little  bit deeper bring out the scrub brush and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,307039,312160,scrub underneath the faucet head because  that gets really nasty but otherwise the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,312160,317840,sink itself doesn't get too gross the  countertop doesn't get really nasty it's  mostly the toilet and the shower and the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,317840,324000,way that shower is in there it's got  this little lip around the bottom  between the wall and the tub itself that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,324000,331680,gets a lot of the black mold if i'm not  very careful but otherwise this bathroom  is pretty much a quick clean and i'm not
zVTOCl4fe-Y,331680,337520,one of those people  that  i don't mind cleaning i really don't  even mind the deep cleaning because to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,337520,342639,me i want the clean house i want the  clean space so i'm fine with putting in
zVTOCl4fe-Y,342639,348479,the little extra work to get that so  that way i have a clear head and i'm not  worried about all the germs and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,348479,353840,everything being everywhere and all the  chaos and clutter so cleaning doesn't  really bother me
zVTOCl4fe-Y,353840,361720,but cleaning a toilet  i hate it i don't know why it is my most  hated chore
zVTOCl4fe-Y,365220,371350,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,372720,380840,every day  yeah every day
zVTOCl4fe-Y,382860,391840,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,391840,395800,never up never down
zVTOCl4fe-Y,398800,404080,i really don't know i don't understand  why that is my most hated chore i mean  you would think dishes because you do
zVTOCl4fe-Y,404080,410319,them all the time or laundry because  there's always so much of it especially  for a family our size but no  it's just the toilet for me i don't get
zVTOCl4fe-Y,410319,413319,it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,416170,419290,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,423300,428560,[Music]  this wall flower scent i bought last
zVTOCl4fe-Y,428560,435520,summer and i bought the candle for that  last summer it is so nice and it's like  it's very strong but not in a bad way
zVTOCl4fe-Y,435520,441520,just i love them both but i can't leave  the candle in the bathroom because of  the kids so my only option really is the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,441520,449050,wallflower  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,449360,456400,i'm gonna go ahead and vacuum in here  but i'm not gonna do the floors in here  until i do all of the tile later on in
zVTOCl4fe-Y,456400,461680,this video you'll see that and then when  i walked out of the bathroom to go turn  the camera off that's when i saw the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,461680,468680,little red mark on my wall right there  so i will also be tackling that in just  a minute

zVTOCl4fe-Y,532800,540000,so this area is already clean oh  whichever subscriber told me  to put my dryer balls in a bag thank you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,540000,546399,so much i no longer have to chase these  around it's so time like save so much  time i love it but that's the next thing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,546399,554320,on the agenda i'm going to start those  rugs and whatever towels i find and then  head into there to the girls disaster
zVTOCl4fe-Y,556800,563360,i've seen a lot of things recently and  one of my subscribers mentioned stop  using fabric softener and switch it to  white vinegar so that's what i'm doing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,563360,569680,but it's only been a few loads so i  can't really weigh in but there are a  lot of benefits to switching so if you  want to look that up it is definitely
zVTOCl4fe-Y,569680,575920,worth it to switch from fabric softener  to white vinegar  and this is the girls disaster and it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,575920,581040,was worse than this a couple days ago if  you can even imagine  but yeah this is the current state of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,581040,586080,the girls room that i'm going to help  them tackle because they will never get  this all done by themselves
zVTOCl4fe-Y,586080,592480,and just the night stand alone i'm not  even sure what half of that is i know  this front piece right here is pencil
zVTOCl4fe-Y,592480,598720,and that is some kind of soda that my  daughter spilled which lets me know that  light's been on for several several days
zVTOCl4fe-Y,598720,604000,so i did have to talk to brianna about  that and the scissors in her bed not  sure why i found scissors in her bed
zVTOCl4fe-Y,604000,611160,when i was making it but  that's also another random story for  this video
zVTOCl4fe-Y,612070,618150,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,618150,621340,[Applause]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,623200,630000,making bunk beds is such a struggle i  love them for the space saving that we  get in this room but just making these
zVTOCl4fe-Y,630000,636240,beds sucks and they're low profile bunk  beds so you have a little bit less space  in there so climbing in and trying to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,636240,641519,make this thing is just awful i actually  have to replace declan and aiden's bunk
zVTOCl4fe-Y,641519,646800,bed they've got a black metal like rod  bunk bed but we got a notice in the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,646800,652320,email that it's being recalled  so we have to find them a new one and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,652320,658640,i'm debating buying them black wood this  time instead for the sturdy but i  definitely won't be doing low profile
zVTOCl4fe-Y,658640,664640,like the girls have the only reason is  because gwen was so young when we bought  this  otherwise i would rather have a normal
zVTOCl4fe-Y,664640,670560,sized bunk bed because then you have the  storage underneath and then over to the  nightstand match eraser again and it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,670560,676240,took every bit of this off with no  effort just make sure you're wetting  your magic eraser and that you have some
zVTOCl4fe-Y,676240,681519,kind of rag to go behind it and pick up  any of the residue or the wetness that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,681519,687200,way it actually does its job fully and  you don't have any leftover color or  nothing like that like even you see that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,687200,693200,green spot right there i don't know what  that was but when i first tried to get  it off it came off but it left a little
zVTOCl4fe-Y,693200,699519,bit of green on the actual white but the  more i sat here and scrubbed at it for  just a second or two even the green
zVTOCl4fe-Y,699519,703639,stain was gone

zVTOCl4fe-Y,742720,748639,the vanity stuff even brianna's skates  were over here she had a backpack over  here still the potty
zVTOCl4fe-Y,748639,753839,you name it it was just a mess and there  was plenty of room in the closet they do  have baskets in their closet for
zVTOCl4fe-Y,753839,758950,organization so that's where the  majority of this stuff ended up
zVTOCl4fe-Y,758950,782000,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,782000,787600,you know the drama  is never ending
zVTOCl4fe-Y,787600,793980,and of course the puppy had to come in  and say hi to us and get in the way a  little bit  while we were still trying to organize

zVTOCl4fe-Y,823680,831279,isn't quite giving it to me anymore  which tells me it is time to break out  the carpet cleaner but our carpet  cleaner kind of took a crap so i do need

zVTOCl4fe-Y,838000,843040,the house so that would also be a good  added bonus if it's made for a home with

zVTOCl4fe-Y,853839,860639,i told brianna to pick a room spray she  wanted peppermint i'm like okay well  this week is six months till christmas
zVTOCl4fe-Y,860639,865680,so i guess it fits but i really don't  know why she picked a christmas

zVTOCl4fe-Y,976079,982240,of maybe two and a half to three hours  depending on how deep i want to clean  but i'm not spending my entire day
zVTOCl4fe-Y,982240,987620,cleaning it will look like that in the  footage to you guys but that's not how  it is

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1104320,1109679,while i was doing all the dishes this is  what these two we're doing just  snuggling on the couch under a blanket
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1109679,1116240,and i'm gonna mop my cabinets and a lot  of people have been asking me for  clarification on what i use to mop my  cabinets for one i do have a brand new
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1116240,1122720,head that i use that's four cabinets  only i put it on when i'm going to start  and i take it off as soon as i'm done
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1122720,1128160,hot water about a gallon one tide pod  and five to six squirts of the power
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1128160,1134559,wash that's literally all i use and i  make sure to mix it up really good with  the mop head to make sure the pod is
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1134559,1140160,dissolved before i start cleaning my  cabinets but you'll see here i'm  switching out the one that i typically
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1140160,1145360,use for my floor on the mop and then i  will put the one that is cabinet  specific only
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1145360,1149080,on it and get started
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1150740,1165520,[Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1194640,1201200,still working around all of it and being  involved in everything that i can so i  don't just spend all day cleaning my
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1201200,1207360,house i make sure to stop and do things  with the kids and put the cleaning on  the back burner especially summer when
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1207360,1212720,they're home with me i want to spend  more time with them i don't want to be  cleaning and doing everything i have to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1212720,1219520,do most of my dinners are either  fasteners or crock pots something like  that where we can do as much as we want
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1219520,1225440,to do while they're on vacation before  school goes back and we go back into  that full-blown chaos time of the year

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1258960,1265919,take out my little scraper scrape down  anything that's even remotely stuck on  there just give the counters a good deep
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1265919,1271520,clean and then put all of the items back  i was going to use antibacterial stuff  on the counters and i decided i just
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1271520,1279120,didn't feel like it so i'm just using  the rose mrs meyers but typically i will  use the method anti-back or mix up some
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1279120,1285520,lysol with water in a spray bottle mr  clean something anti-bacterial but today  i just didn't feel like it so mrs myers
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1285520,1302960,will do the trick for today  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1302960,1315508,we don't know  [Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1326159,1332640,down down down baby going down down down  down tried so hard to stay afloat we
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1332640,1338080,keep moving like the river goes baby  going down down down baby going down
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1338080,1351360,down down down  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1351360,1356960,i'm gonna wipe everything down as i put  it back that way in case something is  stuck on the bottom that i just didn't
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1356960,1362080,notice  and while i'm putting my scentsy back  you'll see that i turn it on
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1362080,1367120,and when the knife block goes back i  don't know what happened but it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1367120,1372640,it blew just the bulb completely blew  right there as soon as i lifted up the  the rest of the cord
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1372640,1399160,it popped the bulb  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1400080,1405760,i love this tray in my kitchen we use it  multiple times every day but it does get
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1405760,1412559,really gross in here so i do have to  wipe this down pretty frequently but i  love having a functional piece of decor
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1412559,1417919,on my counter instead of it being  cluttered with just junk that you never  touch this thing gets used every day
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1417919,1424880,multiple times a day and i'm going to  deep clean the glass top i'm going to  use the scrub daddy power paste you guys  already know i love this product it is
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1424880,1429919,getting to the end of it so there is a  little bit more graininess to it it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1429919,1436240,takes a bit more effort to wipe it off  but i mean it's still worth it because  it's fantastic product and a smile face
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1436240,1441919,for you guys because i just had to but  i do like this product there's a lot of  people that think it's over hyped and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1441919,1448320,honestly in some cases it can be unless  you're going to use it in multiple  places not just your glass top i use it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1448320,1455360,in my glass top my stainless steel sink  and i've used it on my shower doors the  glass shower doors they are so easy to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1455360,1462640,clean with that product and it does a  fantastic job so if you're going to use  it all over then yes it's absolutely
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1462640,1467760,worth it if you're just going to use it  for one spot know you could find  something else that's easier
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1467760,1474320,and not ten dollars a jar you can buy  baking soda and dawn for your stainless  steel sink and it's so much cheaper and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1474320,1497840,does just as great of a job  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1497840,1504640,it can't be over  oh since i have the power paste out  anyways i'm going to scrub the stainless
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1504640,1510640,steel down as well just make sure when  you're scrubbing your sink if you have a  garbage disposal sink you want to get
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1510640,1517200,down there and clean that gasket up  underneath it because that's where a lot  of germs like if you have a smell coming
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1517200,1523360,from your sink nine times out of ten  it's that gasket and or your garbage  disposal so just make sure to clean that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1523360,1529919,part really really well and then my  faucet for some reason i think we have  like really hard water or something but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1529919,1536400,you can see how gross it gets underneath  my faucet head all the time it can be  three days and it will look like that so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1536400,1542640,i just use some power wash and a scrub  brush and clean it off  but i don't know if it's the faucet head
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1542640,1548960,or if it's our water or a combination of  the two but either way that thing always  looks like that and shoots funny and i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1548960,1554400,have to clean it very frequently and  since i switched out the soap in the  bathroom i'm gonna take the lemon out
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1554400,1561039,and i'm gonna put the firecracker one in  here for july because it's coming next  week but that way i've switched out both
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1561039,1564600,soaps for fun

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1608640,1613760,i'm gonna admit right now this white  tray i cannot remember the last time i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1613760,1619200,wiped it down  i'm pretty sure it was when i put the  green thing and the candle on there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1619200,1626120,weeks and weeks ago  i i really don't remember and it was  horrible
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1626220,1636720,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1636720,1643039,if you've watched any of my other  cleaning videos you know that i clean  from top down so since the counters and  everything were done now i'll do the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1643039,1648799,stainless steel on the lower part of the  kitchen like the dishwasher and the  range and then i will move over to the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1648799,1658759,stainless steel on the  i refrigerator wanna waste my time

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1745039,1751039,as with the counters once i scrub down  the dining room table i am going to  scrub down all of the pieces of decor on
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1751039,1757120,this tray put that back and then i do  have to refill the dog treats they go in  that little glass dish with the rose
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1757120,1763840,gold cover that's just an old candle jar  i've cleaned out and made it functional  it looked a lot better than the weird
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1763840,1769039,dog treat container that used to sit in  this tray and then you'll see mako pop  his little head in here because he knew
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1769039,1773639,i was playing with his treats and he had  to have one

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1825840,1831840,day it was pretty late in the afternoon  but i still had to fix the couch pillows
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1831840,1849559,and the blankets probably a good seven  times before bed that night  [Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1877840,1884960,bedrooms so this is my question for  anyone that has a bissell crosswave or  the tin necko or however you pronounce
zVTOCl4fe-Y,1884960,1890480,that company or any of the ones that is  a duo of a vacuum and a mop in one

zVTOCl4fe-Y,1896880,1901919,because i do plan to get one either on  an amazon sale or wait till black friday

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2259359,2264560,pile for trash and it cleaned up really  really quickly actually because the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2264560,2270359,majority of it was actually crap that  does go in that shopping cart
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2273550,2284449,[Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2297280,2302960,small little things that didn't belong  up there and the rest was laundry from  when i folded a couple days ago there

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2512400,2518240,back and let me know if she meant the  soft scrub or the powder so i bought the  soft scrub to try
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2518240,2524800,it was fantastic is it 100 better no but  is it better than any product i've found
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2524800,2529839,so far for down there absolutely you do  have to wipe it off really well though
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2529839,2537838,to make sure you don't leave any of that  behind because bar keepers friend is one  of those things you do have to rinse off  but so good

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2562480,2569200,going to put the toothbrushes in  peroxide you guys know that i do that  because that way they'll be getting  clean and then they won't get any of the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2569200,2576560,windex or method or anything i'm  spraying in here they won't get it on  them  the bath toys are covered and just gross
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2576560,2582240,i can't tell if there's mold inside  these ducks or not so they are going out  the only thing that survived was the cup
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2582240,2588920,and the orange and the comb that was in  there everything else made it to the  trash
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2589480,2597078,[Applause]  we won't be scared

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2616880,2623440,for a little while now i've been trying  out epsom salt in the bottom of my  toothbrush holder because it was  recommended a long time ago
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2623440,2628720,and it's not bad it does help keep the  inside the toothbrush holder clean it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2628720,2634640,does keep the inside of the toothbrush  holder clean a whole lot easier and you  don't have to use much this is a one
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2634640,2640160,pound bag and i've had it for a while  because you just need about half an inch  to an inch in the bottom of this thing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2640160,2647280,and that's it but i do have one problem  with it right here when your toothbrush  goes in there damp it hangs on so right
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2647280,2653280,at the end of your toothbrush there's  always just little bits of salt it's  just a nitpicky thing it does help but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2653280,2657240,that bothers me a little bit
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2659800,2675280,[Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2741040,2746760,and i know that i said all these things
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2748210,2754560,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2754560,2759839,filming my bathroom is always so  difficult and i hate that with you guys  because i have to move the camera or you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2759839,2764880,guys get it half cut off and moving the  camera it still doesn't help because  then it gets bumped and it's in the way
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2764880,2772079,and  but i am doing the floors now i'm just  gonna vacuum all over and then use the  exact same mop bucket from the main
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2772079,2777280,floors in here to clean these floors  really well over by the toilet and back
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2777280,2782960,by the shower where you see me now all  the way out but you don't see me put the  rugs back in because at this point they
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2782960,2791078,were finishing up in the dryer and i  completely forgot to film the part of  putting the rugs back in both bathrooms
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2793480,2801199,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2804340,2810960,[Music]  i said i had a ton of laundry to fold  and i wasn't lying and at this point
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2810960,2817200,there was still another load  in the dryer so this wasn't even all of  it but as per usual i'm gonna sort it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2817200,2823680,out into kids adults and towels and then  give my older kids their clothes and i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2823680,2829119,will fold mine my husbands declans  gwen's and any towels or linen i handle
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2829119,2845149,that part  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2847920,2853359,all kitchen towels get rolled i've  showed you guys that before and i use  that exact same technique on all of the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2853359,2858400,beach towels because that way in case  we're going to the pool or the beach or  whatever we're doing they don't come
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2858400,2863760,undone so that way i could just throw  them in the beach bag or throw them in  the back of my car or wherever we're
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2863760,2870079,using them and they stay more compact  and i don't have to worry about  unraveling and being a big giant mess
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2870079,2878480,my intention for this video was to give  you guys at least an hour if not an hour  and a half of straight brand new content
zVTOCl4fe-Y,2878480,2884240,of cleaning my house start to finish i  do not know how i only managed to get 49

zVTOCl4fe-Y,2890960,2897680,what happened there but what i decided  to do was go ahead and throw  four of my favorite videos from last

zVTOCl4fe-Y,3442720,3448480,from sam's they're non-breakable my kids  have been taking my mason jars and just  kind of cracking them and everything so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3448480,3453520,i'm not dealing with that anymore i got  them plastic and clear plastic because  they will leave drinks with like this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3453520,3459599,much sitting in them on the counter  because they just couldn't see how much  was left and they just kind of left them  so this way i can see and be like oh hey

zVTOCl4fe-Y,3513280,3518559,depends on the condition now obviously  if my house was a complete train wreck  like my kids do some days that ain't

zVTOCl4fe-Y,3596240,3602799,slightly themed but this is for the  month this is the week i am shopping for  so i know exactly how much chicken i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3602799,3608160,have to buy for the entire month and  everything it just makes it so much  easier we are currently unloading and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3608160,3617359,then i'll show you everything we got but  i was gonna film in the stores it was  chaos so that definitely didn't happen  this is a mixture from walmart and sam's
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3617359,3623040,and then back there i've got five below  and that is just a few things from  marshalls i'll show you that in a minute
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3623040,3628720,let's just run down  some pirate booty some of that this  right here goes that big old bag of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3628720,3636079,chips pretzels things like that  all of this is for dinners this week  we're going to do fajitas sheet pan
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3636079,3642400,this is for a ham and potato soup we  have breakfast for dinner one night that  back there is for shepherd's pie
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3642400,3647599,things like that and then some more  cereal oh and we're also having a  breakfast dinner right now pancakes with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3647599,3654000,that  i need more of this because it's just  delicious  and then a few little snacks these are
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3654000,3659520,for reese's cup s'mores if you haven't  tried that so good but this is the place  of the chocolate
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3659520,3666240,i need more tide pods more milk like  always  sam's was completely out of chicken none
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3666240,3672240,whatsoever so i had to buy these at  walmart i'm gonna separate these out for  the freezer and i have beef behind me
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3672240,3677680,clothes are always great at sam's  they're good quality and ridiculously  cheap so each kid got like an active
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3677680,3683839,wear shorts set in there  and then five below is just random junk
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3683839,3690160,like more coloring books and things like  that so  that's all that that is
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3690319,3695920,okay  my fruit containers broke so just fyi  marshals and tj maxx are a good place to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3695920,3701839,get those and they are fantastic  continuing with sam's my husband picked  up this big old thing a tater tots and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3701839,3707359,waffle fries because i picked up the  knock off of the chick-fil-a chicken  this stuff
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3707359,3712880,don't sleep on it it is amazing  and then hot dogs a big old bag of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3712880,3718319,frozen fruit for smoothies here is our  meat  for our beef mexican cheese because we
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3718319,3724319,have to pizza rolls more sealed declan  pick that one and then these reheat so  well so we got those for lunches for the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3724319,3730480,kids that's gonna do as far as all the  grocery haul goes i'm gonna go ahead and  put this stuff away the baby just laid
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3730480,3736480,down for a nap we were gonna go to the  pool and it just started raining so i'm  not really sure what's next probably
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3736480,3741680,some cleaning i always get asked how we  save money on meat for a family our size
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3741680,3748480,and i always buy our meat in bulk  typically at sam's i buy the big huge  pack of chicken that i can get three
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3748480,3754720,meals out of these i can only get two  for each one  but still it's a lot cheaper 1.99 a
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3754720,3759760,pound versus 3.99 a pound  for the smaller pack so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3759760,3765280,this is one way and then we made the  investment for the foodsaver  best thing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3765280,3772160,in the world it has saved us so much  money in the long run it even came with  bags so i have yet to have to buy bags
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3772160,3777599,because hang on  it also came with a roll which i haven't
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3777599,3783119,touched yet either so it comes with  what you need for a little while
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3783119,3790480,and then they do sell this piece on its  own so if you don't want to do this  whole thing you get one of these
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3790480,3796720,and buy the bags that have this thing on  it right here and you're good to go  before freezing most of the time i will
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3796720,3802240,cut this extra crap off but that's  mostly in winter because i use the crock  pot a lot and i will just take this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3802240,3807680,straight from the freezer and throw it  in the crock pot most of my chicken in  summer goes on the grill and gets thawed
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3807680,3822800,out so i'll just cut this off then  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3827839,3833920,so change of plans again the rain did  stop it's gone away for about two hours  so we are going to take the kids to the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3833920,3840480,pool and i want to show you guys a  really cool mom hack real fast my  toddlers hate having sunscreen put on
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3840480,3847440,their face  but i do it now with a foundation brush  i've done this for like two or three  summers now but it just helps so much
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3847440,3852480,with my kids not screaming at me  and i can't help but smile
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3852480,3858559,do you know how much i love you you put  my favorite song on
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3858559,3864000,i put my feet up  and we just sing along
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3864000,3873150,and i can't help but feeling  just loving  this moment can we stay here forever
zVTOCl4fe-Y,3873150,3876229,[Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,4381920,4389120,learning books in it and one has all the  coloring books  now he's got to make sense of this mess
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4389120,4392409,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4395130,4398249,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4400500,4415399,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4417600,4423679,all right this is now done as i said the  games are just a mess i'm not worried  about that but then all of the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4423679,4430320,books and all the learning books and  coloring books and then down here it's  all of the crayons and stuff like that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4430320,4436239,paints play-doh bubbles  learning stuff  that won't fit down there in the cart
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4436239,4442880,that's got spare paper spare notebooks  all kinds of random school supplies  then this is like pens and scissors and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4442880,4448400,glue sticks and stuff and we have zero  pencils in the house so i have to fix  that when school supplies come back
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4448400,4455199,but  the closet is officially cleaned back up  while i was working on cleaning out that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4455199,4461679,little closet the doorbell rang and my  toaster was delivered we've been using a  broke toaster for more months than i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4461679,4468800,even close to proud of for a family our  size so i'm going to show you the broke  one and then unbox this here is our very
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4468800,4476080,used toaster it is not in good condition  whatsoever but we've had this thing for  years and it held up fantastic
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4476080,4482480,like it doesn't even have the crumb  catcher doors anymore they have gone who  knows where but this is why we had to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4482480,4488960,replace it let's even get to focus see  this bar  right here  well it's broken and bent down there in
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4488960,4494880,the bottom so you can't even use this  side so we don't use this side to light  that one so we've just been using the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4494880,4501120,two slice for months old faithful  looking all nasty
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4501120,4507360,same toaster just years later  but same toaster
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4507360,4512400,beautiful  and everything  where it's supposed to be declan saw a
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4512400,4518239,new toaster he wants toast but before i  even do that  i'm literally going to crank it up with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4518239,4525440,nothing in it  and just burn off any brand new plastic  or gross smell from being in a box
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4525440,4531920,the next thing we're going to work on is  my laundry room now we are still in the  works of updating this and completely
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4531920,4538719,changing it putting more shelves in and  all that  but i've been waiting and waiting and  waiting to clean all this up when we do
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4538719,4544320,that and it's taking too long to get to  that project on our list of house stuff  so i'm not waiting anymore i'm at least
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4544320,4550960,doing something to fix the chaos in here  here's a closer look at the mess that we  are dealing with and i still have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4550960,4556880,candles and decor back behind all those  bottles right there that's why they're  all pushed forward plus i'm too short so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4556880,4562880,i need them to be right on the edge or i  can't reach them  i am not even sure about what 75 of that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4562880,4569840,is in that bucket  and then there is no space up there  for any of this stuff so i have to make
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4569840,4575440,the space now  and i also use this rack right here just  to hang my laundry instead of taking it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4575440,4581520,in my room and hanging in the closet to  dry because i don't have a rack in here  i do plan on putting one either on this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4581520,4589560,wall or this wall over here that way  they can hang and not from the shelf but  i don't have that yet

zVTOCl4fe-Y,4624690,4633320,[Music]  a simple question
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4644719,4648440,a simple question
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4652470,4672560,[Music]  is  [Music]

zVTOCl4fe-Y,4714239,4719920,now i'm going to move out into the  kitchen and dining room area clean up  the snack area where the kids just had  their toast because they want to try out
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4719920,4726198,the new toaster so bad and also work on  the stainless steel in here
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4726250,4742169,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4742880,4749610,and the thing is that these scarves are  scary but they are
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4749610,4755539,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4760080,4766239,everything just falls apart  so i'll just close my eyes and dream
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4766239,4771159,about  our kids
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4772820,4779120,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4779120,4785920,cleaning this just reminded me of a  question i had for you guys now if you  watch my recent videos you know that my
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4785920,4792000,tear tray over there worked  i don't really necessarily know if i  want to put another tiered tray out the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4792000,4798640,holidays are coming  soon i mean we're still a couple you  know two three months away before  decorating but i'm debating if instead
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4798640,4804640,of doing a tiered tray if i just want to  do like a tray  so okay over on my dining room table
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4804640,4810320,i'll show you but i don't know if i want  to do something like this  or a tear tray and also i don't even
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4810320,4816560,know if i want to keep things like this  sitting on my counter anymore because  they're just a clutter magnet but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4816560,4821760,something like this just a one tier tray  obviously with a few more things in it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4821760,4827679,than this but over in the kitchen  instead of a tiered tray but just let me  know what you think because i was
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4827679,4833440,looking back at some old pictures and  stuff the other day and i had two of  those cake stands on my counter and i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4833440,4839120,had flowers in the middle and my island  just looked so cluttered and i'm trying
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4839120,4844239,to figure out if maybe i shouldn't even  have one of those over there and just  put flowers in the middle and then like
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4844239,4886759,a tiered tray or a single tray in the  corner  [Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4891600,4897120,the cleaning portion is done now i'm  going to go ahead and move into dinner  real fast short and sweet just going to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4897120,4902159,show you guys the steps for a very easy  kid-friendly family-friendly summer
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4902159,4909360,dinner so don't worry it's going to be  short and sweet in case you want to  stick around for the recipe part as per  usual mine is doubled so just
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4909360,4916560,ignore  half of this  but you're going to need chicken any  kind breast tenders thighs your choice
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4916560,4922560,some garlic a lemon  half a stick of butter  one cup of broth and a little bit of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4922560,4929440,flour for your chicken salt and pepper  and that's it pat all your chicken dry a  little bit salt and pepper the chicken
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4929440,4934800,garlic powder the chicken and then  you're gonna dredge every bit of it in  the flour in case you know what i mean
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4934800,4940320,by dredge you take your chicken  put it in the flour pat it in flip it  over
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4940320,4946239,pat it some more just make sure the  whole thing is it in the flour like that  next thing skillet big enough for all of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4946239,4950960,your chicken  heat it to about medium high
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4951840,4957280,one tablespoon to two tablespoons  depending if you're doing as much  chicken as me and one to two tablespoons
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4957280,4962320,of butter depending again on how much  chicken you're doing  move all the butter and oil around and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4962320,4968800,then add all of your chicken  into  the pan i hate overcrowding a pan but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4968800,4974480,for this recipe i kind of have to  because i have to make a sauce in here  so i just need one pan and done
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4974480,4980159,cook your chicken about four to five  minutes on each side and then take it  out of the pan and remove any oil that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4980159,4985679,remains make sure your chicken is all  the way cooked before you remove from  the pan and then go ahead and zest your
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4985679,4991600,lemons in the pan with all the good  little brown bits you're going to want  two teaspoons of garlic for one round of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4991600,4998480,chicken  one cup of chicken broth for the one  round of chicken
zVTOCl4fe-Y,4998480,5003840,and then the juice of one normal size  lemon but because mine are massive
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5003840,5009199,it would only be half but i'm doubling  so it's one big lemon
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5009199,5014480,bring this to a simmer and let it simmer  for two to three minutes and then we'll  move on add half a teaspoon of the zest
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5014480,5020880,or one teaspoon if you're doing as much  chicken as i am  three tablespoons or six if you're doing
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5020880,5026400,double like me  put the chicken
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5026400,5035040,back in the pan  coat the top of the chicken  in the sauce that's not submerged
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5035920,5041920,let it sit in there for like three or  four minutes and you're done  and there it is i'll plate it up i just
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5041920,5048719,did some rice pilaf and some steamed  broccoli  put a little piece of lemon on top and  drizzled some more of the sauce on but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5048719,5053840,there you go  all right but that's gonna do it for  this one thank you guys so much for  watching i hope it gave you tons of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5053840,5061280,motivation to get some random crap done  around your house because it's pretty  much what i did was all of the most  random projects in my house today but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5061280,5069400,again i appreciate you all so much give  this one a thumbs up if you enjoyed it  subscribe if you're not already and i'll  see in the next one
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5069420,5090560,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5090560,5096960,hey guys welcome back to my channel or  if you are new here my name is rachel  from rageplus5 today i am doing a get it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5096960,5102400,all done vlog i've got a whole bunch of  things just to knock off of my checklist  i'm going to bring you guys along with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5102400,5108560,me if that sounds like something you'd  like don't forget to hit that subscribe  button stick around and let's get  started before i start actually going
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5108560,5115440,through the checklist and showing you  guys what we're going to be doing i have  switched over recently i haven't really  been liking my iced coffee so i've been
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5115440,5121679,switching over to iced chai lattes like  starbucks and the kitties come say hello
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5121679,5127280,hi guys  so i'm gonna show you how to do that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5127280,5133440,having her water  will i make my tea  i showed this back in fall but if you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5133440,5138800,like the iced chai lattes from starbucks  it is literally just a concentrate for
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5138800,5146159,chai latte this is the brand that they  supposedly use and this one is delicious  and two percent milk that's literally it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5146159,5152560,with ice  according to online you can use the  markings on the cup for the grande one
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5152560,5160320,this is obviously bigger than the grande  so the lines aren't gonna match but i'll  show you the picture in a second  but literally it just says four pumps
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5160320,5166000,which is equivalent to a third of a cup  in so you see it doesn't match my lines
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5166000,5171520,one cup of the milk  which actually does take it to the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5171520,5177679,second line and then ice  and then i put my ice to where the  liquid comes to that top line
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5177679,5183760,and then just throw my straw in there  mix it around and i'm good and then i  can always add more if i want to fill
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5183760,5189600,the whole cup it's just however you want  to do it but that's the good part about  doing it at home if you want a stronger  chai flavor just use more of the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5189600,5195679,concentrate these boxes are only like  three dollars at target and i've used  this the entire week and i still have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5195679,5201920,about to there in the box  so they last you a while and it's a lot  cheaper doing it this way you guys have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5201920,5209520,been around for a while you know i am a  sucker for a checklist so  here is what i'll be handling today and
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5209520,5215199,this one's at the bottom list just in  case i get a hold of it and i just found  something else to add to the list
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5215199,5221840,not sure why but last night at like 10  30 i was cleaning out closets and  shredding paperwork so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5221840,5226880,i have to clean this mess up and the  reason i have to work on the living room
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5226880,5232280,is because my daughter decided to play  with all of the pet toys so that's on  the list
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5232280,5243919,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5249120,5253709,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5256719,5262239,they hear that that's what she wants and  she heard it while i was cleaning up
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5262560,5267600,in my last video i talked about my couch  and about how gross and nasty it gets
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5267600,5272719,and that i bought a steamer for one i  bought the steamer on extreme sell  because of all the stores competing with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5272719,5279600,prime day deals so i got that sucker for  like half off so yes of course i bought  it for two you spend quite a lot of
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5279600,5285280,money on your couches  so we should take better care of them  this is how i'm justifying buying that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5285280,5293360,steamer  my couch is just slightly over a year  old and look at all of the crap on it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5293360,5301280,from having my kids i mean there's five  kids that use this plus my husband and  myself the dog the cat everybody so this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5301280,5306320,drives me nuts and i'm gonna fix that  so let's just give this thing one real
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5306320,5311520,good before shot  there is all of the grossness
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5311520,5317280,here is my new little monster i can't  show you the actual front because that's  really stuck the packing label with my
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5317280,5323110,name and everything so  but here is what it is
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5323110,5356719,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5356719,5364479,so  [Music]  [Applause]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5369250,5390329,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5390719,5397120,this thing is stupid easy to use but i  gotta get her out of my way clean the  rest of the couch and then i'll check  back in i did
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5397120,5403679,just this one half over here but i mean  you can already see a big difference but  i want this to dry so i can see what it
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5403679,5410239,looks like compared to that but one  thing i will note i've used almost the  entire clean tank
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5410239,5416080,and that's just nasty  just the one half  look at the color
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5416080,5422880,of that  just absolutely disgusting so yeah think  your couch isn't dirty find out i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5422880,5429199,still waiting for the couch to dry so  what i'm going to go ahead and do is put  dinner in the crock pot and i'm going to  share it with you guys it's cracked
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5429199,5436560,chicken if you've ever had it it is  amazing it's not the most healthy recipe  but it is super easy and very delicious
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5436560,5442800,one note i don't always use these liners  but i will use it if it's something i  know is gonna really really stick to my
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5442800,5449280,crock pot i'm just not gonna deal with  it and i'm gonna use a liner but that's  up to you  in there i've got
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5449280,5455679,three chicken breasts yes they are  frozen  either way thawed frozen your choice bag  of ranch
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5455679,5462760,a block of cream cheese i do it in cubes  just because you want to get it all over  in there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5463440,5468560,lid on  low for six high for four
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5468560,5474480,moving on to the next item on the  checklist and that was the new pot if  you saw one of my former videos i was
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5474480,5479760,talking about the warranty claim on our  pots because they claim to be dishwasher  safe and they definitely weren't i have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5479760,5485760,them sitting right here this is what  it's supposed to look like  this is what it looked like after just  two rounds in the dishwasher and there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5485760,5491040,is one in between that's even you know a  mix of the two that was in there once
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5491040,5497199,but it claimed it it wasn't i handled  the warranty claim and what we got as a  replacement were these
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5497199,5503520,so they told me i can keep these trash  these donate these do what i want with  them so now i have to clean all the new
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5503520,5508719,pots and figure out what i'm keeping  what i'm getting rid of and the whole  nine yards i don't
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5508719,5514880,necessarily have to throw any of the  pots out or donate them because they  still cook well they're just not
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5514880,5522000,pleasing to look at and definitely  cannot be thrown in that dishwasher  again  so i mean now i just got a side and also
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5522000,5527360,that is not the same brand of pots  because we were worried  that if there is something wrong with
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5527360,5534400,these you know the same set would be the  same issue so we did go with a fully  different brand i do have space up there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5534400,5541760,for the new lids so that's not a problem  but down here i could probably stack the  new big one with this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5541760,5549920,but there's not a whole lot of space  here because i bought this separate  really large skillet for my family which  this brand is the new brand up there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5549920,5557040,this one not these  and then this is the really bad  dishwasher pan  this one is second
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5557040,5563360,and that one is awful so i really don't  know what stays and what goes so  basically what i decided to do i'm going
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5563360,5570080,to keep the old set back there just in  case there's a problem with the new pans  it's very rare but it still can be i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5570080,5575120,going to put the new lids up there stack  the new big pan inside that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5575120,5583400,and then just put all the other new ones  over here where the old ones were  no clue where i'm storing this now
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5584900,5590080,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5590080,5597600,give me love give me all your love all  cause i want you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5598480,5605920,no one else makes me feel this way don't  know what you do

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5644470,5654960,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5654960,5660159,about to dry all those and get them put  away  and then i am resorting to different
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5660159,5666080,measures for the couch because it's  taking longer to dry than i want so now  i'm gonna dry it this way and as per
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5666080,5672880,usual my kids like to give me an extra  mess when i've already cleaned the mess  so all these little toys have just been
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5672880,5679520,thrown out here and some shoes  can anyone else have pokemon obsessed  children and have pokemon cards all over

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5720480,5727920,one might ask what's the deal with all  the sweets  we throw all the stuff up there that the  kids have to ask for and then i will
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5727920,5735199,just buy some stuff throw it up there  and then kind of forget that i bought it  none of this is old none of it's  outdated it's just was too much of a
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5735199,5740320,cluster and now i do have to organize  what's going on  but if you are you know a festive person
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5740320,5747199,red white and blue hershey bars those  are round and these things if you have  not tried these things yet they are so
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5747199,5754239,good it's like little mini nerd ropes  delicious and they also make red white  and blue sour patch kids in a big old
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5754239,5760480,bag i found this at aldi for like four  dollars and change i've seen it at five  below  but yeah if you want to be a little
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5760480,5765840,extra patriotic with your kids they have  that too  this right here has just put a huge
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5765840,5773440,damper on cleaning the playhouse it's  around this corner i'm not even going in  there i'll show you from the window but  yeah huge downpour this thing right here

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5780560,5787679,water table sand table little combo but  i have to fix the pavilion because the  wind has been messing it up and i have
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5787679,5794520,to clean all of that but yeah that's off  the agenda today

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5854239,5859440,are dry  so you can really see a difference you  can see the lines still in it so i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5859440,5865280,assuming if i vacuum it that will  correct itself  but those four cushions and those two
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5865280,5870719,big cushions have been  cleaned so yeah huge difference between
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5870719,5877199,the two  and that part of the couch is done and  then i redid this bottom part to see if
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5877199,5883199,i can get the lines out of it fans going  so  right now it looks fantastic
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5883199,5888880,and that is gross nasty tank number two  absolutely disgusting gonna move on to
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5888880,5894080,the dessert so that way it's ready for  tonight and i'm making a very simple  banana pudding i'm not doing anything
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5894080,5899119,too elaborate this is just the way my  mom used to do it when i was growing up  and it is just the instant vanilla
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5899119,5906080,pudding bananas and vanilla wafers  really really simple i only cut up one  banana at a time my kids like them very
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5906080,5911520,very thin  and then you're going to need four cups  of milk for two boxes of this
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5911520,5916719,beat it for about two minutes maybe  three  and then i typically use a glass bowl
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5916719,5922000,but for right now just with the kids i'm  gonna use this plastic one and then  you're gonna layer cookies in the bottom
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5922000,5928960,layer bananas put some of the pudding  and keep going until you just run out of  stuff see there's layer one of cookies
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5928960,5936080,and bananas  there's the second layer of cookies and  bananas on top of the pudding and there
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5936080,5943360,is the last layer of bananas and cookies  and just the right amount of pudding to  cover it there's the pudding
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5943360,5948639,can't really see the layers from the  side like that but  it will just get the lid and go in the
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5948639,5953840,fridge for at least an hour but you know  two or three is best

zVTOCl4fe-Y,5984560,5990639,i love it it looks so much better that  little machine is super easy the actual  cleaning time was less than half an hour
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5990639,5997840,the drying time took longer than that  but still so easy and to get the whole  couch clean and looking like that i
zVTOCl4fe-Y,5997840,6003280,haven't seen it look like that since it  was maybe a month or two old and then  the pillow covers back there they're
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6003280,6010400,covering those old nasty white and gray  ones that have been sitting on my couch  those are just some pillow covers i  found it was a pack of two for 7.99 on
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6010400,6017760,amazon now i will say the pack of 2 is  actually 9.99  but there is a 20 off coupon which makes
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6017760,6024480,it 7.99 and there are tons of different  colors there was a navy blue i almost  went with there's a yellow a pink you
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6024480,6031440,name it but you all know me with buffalo  check so of course i had to make summer  colors work for that
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6035119,6041820,to be too and baby dance the night away  i let my head down if i won
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6041820,6046880,[Music]  don't you just get tired chasing fame
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6046880,6051440,and being pretty all the time

zVTOCl4fe-Y,6080560,6087040,back to the dinner the chicken is cooked  all the way through i took it out and  you can shred it with a fork but i am
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6087040,6092080,way too lazy for that  and this is much faster
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6092080,6096280,let yourself be free

zVTOCl4fe-Y,6110060,6113709,[Music]
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6116639,6122239,20 second video  three chicken breasts yep mix the  chicken back into the cream cheese it's
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6122239,6127920,in there take some real bacon pieces  this is a 2.5 ounce bag
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6127920,6133199,it says choose the whole thing but use  it at your discretion or you can also  use bacon that you cook and crumble
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6133199,6140320,yourself  and then you need to use a two cup bag  of cheddar i don't have cheddar so i'm
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6140320,6146639,using mexican style but  i mean you could do this any way you  want  but just give it a good mix and then put
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6146639,6151679,your lid back on cook it for another 10  to 15 minutes and then serve it up we
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6151679,6156800,are serving ours up on hamburger buns  tonight and doing cracked chicken
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6156800,6162400,sandwiches  but you don't have to make sandwiches  out of this you can put it over rice
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6162400,6168400,over mashed potatoes i've done it even  with adding pasta to it but when i do  that i do recommend you adding a little
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6168400,6176239,more liquid to it i breathe  some kind of chicken stock or some kind  of even milk will help but it will dry
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6176239,6181679,it out really bad if you don't add some  more liquid if you are putting this with  pasta dinner is done and there is not
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6181679,6188800,much cleanup thanks to that liner but  like i said earlier you don't have to  use those if you don't want the extra  plastic or waste in your life just skip
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6188800,6194159,it you don't have to use those it's just  a preference i do when i know  something's going to really badly stick
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6194159,6201280,and going to be really hard to clean  other than that i don't have much left  to do the only thing i didn't get to on  my checklist was the guest bathroom but
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6201280,6206719,i will handle that tomorrow for right  now i am going to go ahead and say  goodnight take care of my kids get them
zVTOCl4fe-Y,6206719,6211920,showered and all that ready for bed and  play as a family thank you guys so much  for watching this one if you enjoyed it
