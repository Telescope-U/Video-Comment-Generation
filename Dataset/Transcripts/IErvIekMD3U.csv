IErvIekMD3U,480,2399,prepare yourself for 19 of the most
IErvIekMD3U,2399,5040,tragic toxic tech fails of all time from
IErvIekMD3U,5040,6879,straight up bad ideas to some of the
IErvIekMD3U,6879,8960,most malignant harmful products to have
IErvIekMD3U,8960,11599,ever existed number one is an absolute
IErvIekMD3U,11599,14320,travesty so number 19 you know for the
IErvIekMD3U,14320,16640,last 60 years the key input device to
IErvIekMD3U,16640,19359,your computer has been the mouse right
IErvIekMD3U,19359,21840,well in the year 2000 someone had the
IErvIekMD3U,21840,24720,very bright idea to also make a cat to
IErvIekMD3U,24720,26080,go along with it
IErvIekMD3U,26080,28000,this is the qcat it was made to be able
IErvIekMD3U,28000,30000,to quickly scan codes within newspapers
IErvIekMD3U,30000,32000,and magazines and then because it's
IErvIekMD3U,32000,34000,connected to your computer directly open
IErvIekMD3U,34000,36160,up a web page in your browser to learn
IErvIekMD3U,36160,39680,more think qr code it was a very easy
IErvIekMD3U,39680,41520,sell to companies because you know their
IErvIekMD3U,41520,43040,newspaper ads would be more likely to
IErvIekMD3U,43040,44879,drive sales if people were scanning them
IErvIekMD3U,44879,47120,and for consumers well i mean everyone
IErvIekMD3U,47120,49039,has a mouse of course they're going to
IErvIekMD3U,49039,50800,want a cat right
IErvIekMD3U,50800,52320,that's what i thought too before this
IErvIekMD3U,52320,55199,one ah
IErvIekMD3U,55760,58879,fudge be proud of yourself the problem
IErvIekMD3U,58879,60800,was that the q-cat completely
IErvIekMD3U,60800,63440,misunderstood readers like what kind of
IErvIekMD3U,63440,64478,person is going to open up their
IErvIekMD3U,64478,66799,newspaper in the morning but then think
IErvIekMD3U,66799,68960,oh wait no i might want to get more info
IErvIekMD3U,68960,70799,about the ads today i'd better take this
IErvIekMD3U,70799,72560,up to the study and sit 10 centimeters
IErvIekMD3U,72560,75119,from my computer to read so i'll give
IErvIekMD3U,75119,76479,the cue cat a
IErvIekMD3U,76479,78960,2 out of 10 on the fail scale why do the
IErvIekMD3U,78960,80320,mice always win
IErvIekMD3U,80320,82560,number 18. so you know when companies
IErvIekMD3U,82560,84880,launch smartphones it's not uncommon for
IErvIekMD3U,84880,86000,there to be a flood of people
IErvIekMD3U,86000,87280,complaining that it didn't have this
IErvIekMD3U,87280,89280,feature or it didn't have that feature
IErvIekMD3U,89280,91680,well the zetty hawkeye is what happens
IErvIekMD3U,91680,93840,when a company listens a little too much
IErvIekMD3U,93840,96720,to this feedback in january 2016 zt
IErvIekMD3U,96720,98000,announced that they were going to build
IErvIekMD3U,98000,100479,a phone based on what their users wanted
IErvIekMD3U,100479,102640,it might sound like a great idea but
IErvIekMD3U,102640,104159,they would soon come to realize that
IErvIekMD3U,104159,105520,while their fans were voting for
IErvIekMD3U,105520,107600,features that they wanted to see
IErvIekMD3U,107600,109439,those weren't necessarily the same
IErvIekMD3U,109439,110880,features that they'd actually want to
IErvIekMD3U,110880,113439,buy and based on the most upvoted
IErvIekMD3U,113439,115759,comments what zetti ended up with was an
IErvIekMD3U,115759,118399,eye-tracking operated self-adhesive
IErvIekMD3U,118399,120079,smartphone or in other words a device
IErvIekMD3U,120079,121439,that you could operate completely
IErvIekMD3U,121439,123759,through micro eye movements and one that
IErvIekMD3U,123759,125280,you'd be able to stick to any service
IErvIekMD3U,125280,126799,you wanted thanks to a special
IErvIekMD3U,126799,129039,rubberized material on the back problem
IErvIekMD3U,129039,131360,was how on earth do you follow through
IErvIekMD3U,131360,133760,on that zt had committed to building
IErvIekMD3U,133760,135680,this eye tracking tech before they
IErvIekMD3U,135680,138000,actually knew how to do it this adhesive
IErvIekMD3U,138000,139920,backing was not actually for the phone
IErvIekMD3U,139920,141920,itself because if your phone is sticky
IErvIekMD3U,141920,144319,all the time it's gonna stick to things
IErvIekMD3U,144319,146800,that you don't want it to stick to
IErvIekMD3U,146800,148160,so they applied the grippiness to the
IErvIekMD3U,148160,150480,phone's case instead of the phone itself
IErvIekMD3U,150480,152080,and just to be able to cram all these
IErvIekMD3U,152080,153760,wacky features in while keeping the
IErvIekMD3U,153760,156000,price affordable the actual specs of the
IErvIekMD3U,156000,158720,phone sucked it's a good example of how
IErvIekMD3U,158720,160959,sometimes consumers don't know what they
IErvIekMD3U,160959,162239,want
IErvIekMD3U,162239,164879,hey so nike's a pretty cool company
IErvIekMD3U,164879,168000,right great shoes cool tops impressive
IErvIekMD3U,168000,169599,tech i mean this is the company who came
IErvIekMD3U,169599,171360,out with those self-lacing trainers a
IErvIekMD3U,171360,173120,few years ago but
IErvIekMD3U,173120,175760,nike's magneto was a
IErvIekMD3U,175760,177920,not their coolest idea the company was
IErvIekMD3U,177920,180080,looking at athletes at the time and they
IErvIekMD3U,180080,182000,couldn't help but feel like these highly
IErvIekMD3U,182000,184319,optimized almost superhuman beings were
IErvIekMD3U,184319,186480,being burdened by bulky cumbersome
IErvIekMD3U,186480,189200,glasses and headwear and so their answer
IErvIekMD3U,189200,192560,was sunglasses without temples the bits
IErvIekMD3U,192560,194640,that go over your ears how do they stay
IErvIekMD3U,194640,198480,in place you might ask well by gluing
IErvIekMD3U,198480,201200,magnets to your face so that the glasses
IErvIekMD3U,201200,203200,can snap to them
IErvIekMD3U,203200,205440,obviously the much better solution is it
IErvIekMD3U,205440,207920,fair to say they had no i
IErvIekMD3U,207920,211280,dear i risk my case
IErvIekMD3U,211280,214159,okay point is three out of ten fail okay
IErvIekMD3U,214159,216560,welcome to a very unfortunate case study
IErvIekMD3U,216560,218799,on the importance of naming all the way
IErvIekMD3U,218799,220480,back in the 1930s one of the big
IErvIekMD3U,220480,222879,companies on the rise was called
IErvIekMD3U,222879,224319,aids
IErvIekMD3U,224319,226159,you can probably see where i'm going
IErvIekMD3U,226159,227920,with this this company had apparently
IErvIekMD3U,227920,230080,developed a technologically miraculous
IErvIekMD3U,230080,232080,candy that you could eat and it would
IErvIekMD3U,232080,233439,fill you up to the point where you
IErvIekMD3U,233439,235280,wouldn't have to have a proper meal and
IErvIekMD3U,235280,237280,therefore lose weight
IErvIekMD3U,237280,239439,and i mean the concept of eating to lose
IErvIekMD3U,239439,241840,weight is is kind of everyone's dream
IErvIekMD3U,241840,243599,milo would be a very thin cat wouldn't
IErvIekMD3U,243599,245760,you oh wait
IErvIekMD3U,245760,247760,you just ate that
IErvIekMD3U,247760,250319,so when you combine that with some very
IErvIekMD3U,250319,251920,loose advertising standards back in the
IErvIekMD3U,251920,254239,day how the papers were filled with aids
IErvIekMD3U,254239,256079,ads how it's being recommended by movie
IErvIekMD3U,256079,258160,stars without conclusive research this
IErvIekMD3U,258160,260479,brand was understandably and
IErvIekMD3U,260479,262800,ironically ballooning
IErvIekMD3U,262800,263840,until
IErvIekMD3U,263840,266400,1981 where medical officers at the
IErvIekMD3U,266400,268479,center for disease control and decided
IErvIekMD3U,268479,270160,to name the breakout deadly immune
IErvIekMD3U,270160,271840,system infection that was spiraling out
IErvIekMD3U,271840,274000,of control at the time
IErvIekMD3U,274000,275199,aids
IErvIekMD3U,275199,278720,it did make the candy company viral just
IErvIekMD3U,278720,280960,not the good kind it gave a whole new
IErvIekMD3U,280960,282960,meaning to these ads that's for sure why
IErvIekMD3U,282960,285840,take diet pills when you can enjoy aids
IErvIekMD3U,285840,288479,three out of ten fail there's a
IErvIekMD3U,288479,290639,there's no treatment for that
IErvIekMD3U,290639,292560,okay let's step this up another level
IErvIekMD3U,292560,294160,ever closer to the 10 out of 10
IErvIekMD3U,294160,296000,nightmare that is number one you might
IErvIekMD3U,296000,298400,know this already but i'm a big fan of
IErvIekMD3U,298400,300160,ikea and actually if you've watched my
IErvIekMD3U,300160,301680,videos right from the very beginning you
IErvIekMD3U,301680,303120,might know that i've built this channel
IErvIekMD3U,303120,306479,up by filming on an ikea table for a
IErvIekMD3U,306479,309120,simple reason they have a killer
IErvIekMD3U,309120,310800,business model instead of selling
IErvIekMD3U,310800,313039,pre-built furniture ikea instead sells
IErvIekMD3U,313039,314960,customers the parts to be able to build
IErvIekMD3U,314960,316960,that furniture themselves this is what
IErvIekMD3U,316960,318479,allows ikea to make their products
IErvIekMD3U,318479,320160,quicker it saves them costs from
IErvIekMD3U,320160,322720,assembly and shipping plus it just means
IErvIekMD3U,322720,323680,that when people build their own
IErvIekMD3U,323680,324400,furniture
IErvIekMD3U,324400,326880,they grow that little bit attached to it
IErvIekMD3U,326880,329039,kind of like lego like if lego just sold
IErvIekMD3U,329039,330479,the finished sets without you needing to
IErvIekMD3U,330479,332400,assemble them i don't think anyone would
IErvIekMD3U,332400,335759,care however in the mid-80s ikea
IErvIekMD3U,335759,338960,suddenly had an ike deer
IErvIekMD3U,338960,340960,a way to take this philosophy to the
IErvIekMD3U,340960,343520,absolute extreme a sofa that you can
IErvIekMD3U,343520,345120,blow up yourself
IErvIekMD3U,345120,347120,using a hair dryer it would be the
IErvIekMD3U,347120,349680,easiest possible thing to assemble and
IErvIekMD3U,349680,351759,given how big sofas usually are the
IErvIekMD3U,351759,353759,ability to be able to send one in a form
IErvIekMD3U,353759,355759,factor barely larger than a pizza box
IErvIekMD3U,355759,357840,would save ikea so much money versus
IErvIekMD3U,357840,359520,their competitors
IErvIekMD3U,359520,361680,the slight issue though was that ikea
IErvIekMD3U,361680,364000,forgot the simple fact that hair dryers
IErvIekMD3U,364000,368479,blow out hot air and the plastic
IErvIekMD3U,368479,370080,melts
IErvIekMD3U,370080,372639,see where i'm going with this
IErvIekMD3U,372639,374160,but even if you did manage to blow one
IErvIekMD3U,374160,377120,up these sofas weren't completely
IErvIekMD3U,377120,380800,airtight which led to a sinking feeling
IErvIekMD3U,380800,382479,and the fact that they were so
IErvIekMD3U,382479,384720,unbelievably light meant that every time
IErvIekMD3U,384720,386319,you sat down
IErvIekMD3U,386319,387680,they would move
IErvIekMD3U,387680,391039,so in the end less of a stroke of genius
IErvIekMD3U,391039,394560,more just hot air 4 out of 10. and on a
IErvIekMD3U,394560,396800,similar note of overlooking a simple but
IErvIekMD3U,396800,398880,very important fact
IErvIekMD3U,398880,402080,nintendo now nintendo is a company not
IErvIekMD3U,402080,404960,afraid to experiment and the power glove
IErvIekMD3U,404960,407120,was possibly the most extreme example of
IErvIekMD3U,407120,408800,that this thing was straight out of
IErvIekMD3U,408800,411680,science fiction it turned your hand into
IErvIekMD3U,411680,413520,the controller and if that sounds
IErvIekMD3U,413520,415199,familiar that's because this technology
IErvIekMD3U,415199,416960,was actually what formed the basis of
IErvIekMD3U,416960,418960,what eventually became the nintendo wii
IErvIekMD3U,418960,421280,and we can't say that the tech wasn't
IErvIekMD3U,421280,423599,clever essentially this glove has an
IErvIekMD3U,423599,425759,ultrasound speaker inside of it which
IErvIekMD3U,425759,427840,can fire out a sound wave you mount
IErvIekMD3U,427840,429599,three separate receivers all around your
IErvIekMD3U,429599,431599,tv and then each one of those receivers
IErvIekMD3U,431599,433360,would record how long the sound wave
IErvIekMD3U,433360,435680,from the glove took to get to them which
IErvIekMD3U,435680,437039,then allows the calculation of the
IErvIekMD3U,437039,439360,glove's position in the three axes of
IErvIekMD3U,439360,441520,motion if all three receivers record the
IErvIekMD3U,441520,443919,same time for example then they know the
IErvIekMD3U,443919,445919,glove is in the middle people are
IErvIekMD3U,445919,448240,absolutely blown away seeing their hands
IErvIekMD3U,448240,450720,projected inside of these games and
IErvIekMD3U,450720,453599,initial sales were through the roof but
IErvIekMD3U,453599,455199,the company forgot about one quite
IErvIekMD3U,455199,457199,important facet
IErvIekMD3U,457199,459520,it needed to be fun i think they got so
IErvIekMD3U,459520,461680,caught up in the logistics making sure
IErvIekMD3U,461680,463680,all old nintendo games worked with it
IErvIekMD3U,463680,465120,and just getting all the tech into an
IErvIekMD3U,465120,467199,affordable package that no one stopped
IErvIekMD3U,467199,469120,to ask the question of is holding your
IErvIekMD3U,469120,471199,hand out for two hours at a time
IErvIekMD3U,471199,473840,actually enjoyable and is it actually a
IErvIekMD3U,473840,477120,better form of input for 99 of games to
IErvIekMD3U,477120,478639,both questions
IErvIekMD3U,478639,480960,no and so people quite quickly lost
IErvIekMD3U,480960,483280,interest and the nintendo power glove
IErvIekMD3U,483280,485840,was buried in the cupboard
IErvIekMD3U,485840,488240,four out of ten
IErvIekMD3U,488240,490479,okay you've heard of espn right the
IErvIekMD3U,490479,494240,sports broadcasting company well in 2006
IErvIekMD3U,494240,495919,they decided to build their own phone
IErvIekMD3U,495919,497759,that would excel at keeping you up to
IErvIekMD3U,497759,500080,date with sports they built new features
IErvIekMD3U,500080,501759,like push notifications for when a goal
IErvIekMD3U,501759,503680,was scored which laid the foundations of
IErvIekMD3U,503680,506400,espn's future smartphone app but
IErvIekMD3U,506400,509039,the phone itself was uh
IErvIekMD3U,509039,511120,not a home run for starters they priced
IErvIekMD3U,511120,513680,the unit itself at 300
IErvIekMD3U,513680,516000,yeah this 300
IErvIekMD3U,516000,517360,but the worst bet is that they then
IErvIekMD3U,517360,520560,charge people up to 220 a month to
IErvIekMD3U,520560,522159,actually get new features
IErvIekMD3U,522159,523440,220
IErvIekMD3U,523440,524560,per month
IErvIekMD3U,524560,526399,who do they think the target consumer is
IErvIekMD3U,526399,528560,here like the queen
IErvIekMD3U,528560,530800,needless to say very few people signed
IErvIekMD3U,530800,531600,up
IErvIekMD3U,531600,533120,five out of ten failed yeah and
IErvIekMD3U,533120,534240,something i thought was quite funny is
IErvIekMD3U,534240,536080,that the first time steve jobs heard
IErvIekMD3U,536080,538480,about this phone he said directly to the
IErvIekMD3U,538480,540880,president of espn your phone is the
IErvIekMD3U,540880,543839,dumbest effing idea i've ever heard
IErvIekMD3U,543839,546240,kind of sounds like a toxic relationship
IErvIekMD3U,546240,547519,you know what else we don't need a phone
IErvIekMD3U,547519,549839,to do
IErvIekMD3U,550080,551200,smoke
IErvIekMD3U,551200,553120,no really just a few years ago the
IErvIekMD3U,553120,555200,e-cigarette company known as vaporcade
IErvIekMD3U,555200,556480,actually came out with a legit
IErvIekMD3U,556480,557680,smartphone
IErvIekMD3U,557680,559839,that you could puff it had dual
IErvIekMD3U,559839,561680,batteries inside and if you decided one
IErvIekMD3U,561680,563120,time that you didn't want to use the
IErvIekMD3U,563120,565120,vape both could be put towards just
IErvIekMD3U,565120,567360,using the phone and there was even an
IErvIekMD3U,567360,569120,app built into it that could tell you
IErvIekMD3U,569120,571040,what flavor was loaded up and how much
IErvIekMD3U,571040,572959,was left they were actually pitching
IErvIekMD3U,572959,575200,themselves as a way to get off smoking
IErvIekMD3U,575200,576480,like the app would alert you when you'd
IErvIekMD3U,576480,578800,had more puffs than you should i can
IErvIekMD3U,578800,581519,kind of see the intention but surely
IErvIekMD3U,581519,583040,surely anyone who would possibly
IErvIekMD3U,583040,585040,consider buying this would already have
IErvIekMD3U,585040,586720,a cigarette they liked with far more
IErvIekMD3U,586720,589440,flavor options and probably also a
IErvIekMD3U,589440,591839,decent working phone the lesson is when
IErvIekMD3U,591839,593279,you try to make a product that's two
IErvIekMD3U,593279,595519,things at once most of the time you're
IErvIekMD3U,595519,597279,shooting yourself in the foot because
IErvIekMD3U,597279,598720,you're not going to be the best either
IErvIekMD3U,598720,600320,and so you're limiting your reach to
IErvIekMD3U,600320,601760,really people who are specifically
IErvIekMD3U,601760,605279,searching for both five out of ten
IErvIekMD3U,605279,607600,what were they smoking okay just before
IErvIekMD3U,607600,610079,we get to the truly toxic fails here's a
IErvIekMD3U,610079,612399,social media platform that nearly had it
IErvIekMD3U,612399,613200,all
IErvIekMD3U,613200,615519,it was called yik yak and it was a
IErvIekMD3U,615519,617920,really intriguing concept basically
IErvIekMD3U,617920,619920,you're completely anonymous no username
IErvIekMD3U,619920,621920,no profile picture and anything you post
IErvIekMD3U,621920,623839,is visible to anyone in a five mile
IErvIekMD3U,623839,626399,radius of you so you might have seen
IErvIekMD3U,626399,628480,this coming this app spread like
IErvIekMD3U,628480,631040,wildfire at universities i used to be on
IErvIekMD3U,631040,633600,it too students would use yik yak like a
IErvIekMD3U,633600,635760,running commentary on local life posting
IErvIekMD3U,635760,637440,things like am i the only one who's
IErvIekMD3U,637440,639600,falling asleep in this lecture or that
IErvIekMD3U,639600,641440,awkward moment when you lock eyes with
IErvIekMD3U,641440,643519,someone in the canteen toilets the fact
IErvIekMD3U,643519,645600,that it was local content only made it
IErvIekMD3U,645600,647360,super engaging because almost everything
IErvIekMD3U,647360,649760,you see was relevant too and this made
IErvIekMD3U,649760,652959,the app contagious prolific at its peak
IErvIekMD3U,652959,654880,yik yak was even ranked above facebook
IErvIekMD3U,654880,656160,in downloads
IErvIekMD3U,656160,658240,however the app's biggest strength the
IErvIekMD3U,658240,660959,anonymity was also its downfall because
IErvIekMD3U,660959,662880,when no one knows who you are people
IErvIekMD3U,662880,665040,become the most extreme versions of
IErvIekMD3U,665040,667680,themselves the app started evolving from
IErvIekMD3U,667680,669360,light-hearted jokes to just try and get
IErvIekMD3U,669360,671839,the most upvotes slightly creepy i
IErvIekMD3U,671839,673519,actually remember one time i was sitting
IErvIekMD3U,673519,675440,in a lecture and i remember reading a
IErvIekMD3U,675440,677360,post that said something like that boy
IErvIekMD3U,677360,680480,in red is looking saucy today
IErvIekMD3U,680480,683040,i was wearing red i can see where they
IErvIekMD3U,683040,684800,were coming from
IErvIekMD3U,684800,686880,i'm kidding but no seriously i remember
IErvIekMD3U,686880,688240,spending the whole rest of that lecture
IErvIekMD3U,688240,689839,just looking around the crowd trying to
IErvIekMD3U,689839,691600,figure out who posted this if they were
IErvIekMD3U,691600,693120,actually talking about me if it was
IErvIekMD3U,693120,695120,someone who actually liked me or if it
IErvIekMD3U,695120,697120,was just my friends trolling me on an
IErvIekMD3U,697120,700000,anonymous platform you've got no idea
IErvIekMD3U,700000,701360,people started using yik yak for hate
IErvIekMD3U,701360,703760,speech racism and bullying and you can
IErvIekMD3U,703760,705519,see how as well as being a super
IErvIekMD3U,705519,707920,engaging form of social media it also
IErvIekMD3U,707920,710320,has all the ingredients for a terrifying
IErvIekMD3U,710320,712880,venomous platform so then
IErvIekMD3U,712880,714880,it started getting banned and with its
IErvIekMD3U,714880,716399,now hampered image
IErvIekMD3U,716399,718079,it was tough to recover
IErvIekMD3U,718079,721360,but now we're in the top ten
IErvIekMD3U,721360,723680,we're talking serious even dangerously
IErvIekMD3U,723680,726320,big fails so when you think of electric
IErvIekMD3U,726320,727760,cars right now there's a pretty good
IErvIekMD3U,727760,730160,chance that you think of tesla but in
IErvIekMD3U,730160,732399,some alternate timeline we may well have
IErvIekMD3U,732399,735200,instead been talking about elio motors
IErvIekMD3U,735200,737760,this company started in 2009 with a very
IErvIekMD3U,737760,740399,similar goal to tesla reduce emissions
IErvIekMD3U,740399,742720,from cars but they had a really
IErvIekMD3U,742720,744399,different way of going about it they
IErvIekMD3U,744399,745600,realized that the number of people
IErvIekMD3U,745600,747839,driving five-seater cars with just one
IErvIekMD3U,747839,749839,or two people in them was going up and
IErvIekMD3U,749839,751360,so instead of pivoting all the way to
IErvIekMD3U,751360,753440,electric which 10 years ago was seen as
IErvIekMD3U,753440,755360,a bit of a gimmick they instead decided
IErvIekMD3U,755360,757519,to make normal petrol cars but with just
IErvIekMD3U,757519,759920,two seats and three wheels
IErvIekMD3U,759920,761600,now that probably sounds like a pretty
IErvIekMD3U,761600,763680,dumb idea but it becomes a lot more
IErvIekMD3U,763680,765279,enticing when you realize that it would
IErvIekMD3U,765279,767279,be half the price to buy and because it
IErvIekMD3U,767279,769279,was so much lighter it could be twice as
IErvIekMD3U,769279,771519,fuel efficient saving you even more in
IErvIekMD3U,771519,773360,the long run the issue seems to be
IErvIekMD3U,773360,776000,simply the fact that making cars is hard
IErvIekMD3U,776000,777680,the sheer amount of money that you need
IErvIekMD3U,777680,779600,to kick-start the manufacturing process
IErvIekMD3U,779600,781920,just makes cars arguably the single
IErvIekMD3U,781920,784240,toughest market for newcomers to enter
IErvIekMD3U,784240,786079,but without clear communication with
IErvIekMD3U,786079,787839,their customers over the years elio
IErvIekMD3U,787839,790160,motors has started to turn from the
IErvIekMD3U,790160,791680,underdog company everyone was rooting
IErvIekMD3U,791680,793920,for to one we're a little concerned with
IErvIekMD3U,793920,797120,to now suspicions of fraud they've taken
IErvIekMD3U,797120,800720,over 65 000 pre-orders and not delivered
IErvIekMD3U,800720,802560,a single car they've revised their
IErvIekMD3U,802560,804639,delivery date so many times we've lost
IErvIekMD3U,804639,806800,count and they've stopped replying to a
IErvIekMD3U,806800,808639,lot of their customers given that people
IErvIekMD3U,808639,810160,have been waiting for almost a decade
IErvIekMD3U,810160,811760,for their deliveries now
IErvIekMD3U,811760,813920,it's safe to say i don't think they're
IErvIekMD3U,813920,815440,getting them
IErvIekMD3U,815440,817200,six out of ten fail
IErvIekMD3U,817200,818000,now
IErvIekMD3U,818000,819920,i don't think i've ever wanted a product
IErvIekMD3U,819920,820800,more
IErvIekMD3U,820800,823440,than i wanted the scribble pen a pen
IErvIekMD3U,823440,825279,which using a color sensor on the back
IErvIekMD3U,825279,827680,can scan anything you see with then a
IErvIekMD3U,827680,829360,specialized barrel that can mix various
IErvIekMD3U,829360,831440,different inks to allow you to draw in
IErvIekMD3U,831440,833680,that exact color you scanned tell me
IErvIekMD3U,833680,835199,that's not the coolest thing you've ever
IErvIekMD3U,835199,837279,heard of i mean clearly people thought
IErvIekMD3U,837279,839440,so literally this 50 second clip racked
IErvIekMD3U,839440,841839,up over 7 million views and the products
IErvIekMD3U,841839,844000,kickstarter campaign passed its funding
IErvIekMD3U,844000,848000,got all in just get this 24 hours
IErvIekMD3U,848000,849279,but then
IErvIekMD3U,849279,851839,i ready to notice something that in one
IErvIekMD3U,851839,853680,frame of this trailer the ink that you
IErvIekMD3U,853680,855360,see written on the paper
IErvIekMD3U,855360,857360,suddenly vanishes
IErvIekMD3U,857360,859199,why would that be the only explanation
IErvIekMD3U,859199,860880,that makes sense to me is that the pen
IErvIekMD3U,860880,862959,in the video was just a prop and all
IErvIekMD3U,862959,864320,these drawings that we've seen were
IErvIekMD3U,864320,866160,actually done with an editing program
IErvIekMD3U,866160,868880,afterwards and as the years went on it
IErvIekMD3U,868880,870240,became more and more clear that this
IErvIekMD3U,870240,871600,company they had made a promise to
IErvIekMD3U,871600,873600,people before knowing how to follow
IErvIekMD3U,873600,875839,through on it it's been 10 years since
IErvIekMD3U,875839,878720,that initial reveal and still no retail
IErvIekMD3U,878720,881360,ready product just a load of shady no
IErvIekMD3U,881360,883440,face shown product unboxings of a
IErvIekMD3U,883440,884880,product that looks nothing like the
IErvIekMD3U,884880,886959,original but of course you've been able
IErvIekMD3U,886959,889120,to pre-order it this entire time with
IErvIekMD3U,889120,891120,your money being taken up front this
IErvIekMD3U,891120,894240,company is the definition of toxic
IErvIekMD3U,894240,895760,marketing
IErvIekMD3U,895760,897360,six out of ten
IErvIekMD3U,897360,899120,and in a similar vein of failed
IErvIekMD3U,899120,900720,crowdfunding projects
IErvIekMD3U,900720,902240,anyone hear shave
IErvIekMD3U,902240,903440,if you do
IErvIekMD3U,903440,905440,you're doing it wrong or at least you
IErvIekMD3U,905440,907680,are according to the laser razor company
IErvIekMD3U,907680,909920,in 2015 this group of people released a
IErvIekMD3U,909920,912240,video saying shaving as we know it is
IErvIekMD3U,912240,914399,far from perfect it talks about how
IErvIekMD3U,914399,916560,normal shaving is a disaster because of
IErvIekMD3U,916560,919040,how it causes redness and razor burn
IErvIekMD3U,919040,920000,so
IErvIekMD3U,920000,922160,they built their own razor it has a thin
IErvIekMD3U,922160,924160,fiber stretched across it and a laser
IErvIekMD3U,924160,925519,that travels down the length of that
IErvIekMD3U,925519,927440,fiber in such a way that when this fiber
IErvIekMD3U,927440,929120,comes into contact with the hair the
IErvIekMD3U,929120,931040,energy is transferred from that laser to
IErvIekMD3U,931040,932079,the hair
IErvIekMD3U,932079,934399,to burn it off they sold it to us like
IErvIekMD3U,934399,936399,it was a piece of science fiction but
IErvIekMD3U,936399,938160,they conveniently missed out the one
IErvIekMD3U,938160,940399,important detail that their current best
IErvIekMD3U,940399,942639,prototype could only burn off
IErvIekMD3U,942639,944800,one hair at a time
IErvIekMD3U,944800,948240,i just can't i i don't even have words
IErvIekMD3U,948240,950240,razer raised over four million dollars
IErvIekMD3U,950240,952959,in funding but was then cancelled when
IErvIekMD3U,952959,955839,enough backers started calling it a scam
IErvIekMD3U,955839,957839,six out of ten while i don't think there
IErvIekMD3U,957839,959920,were malicious intentions here this was
IErvIekMD3U,959920,962880,a tremendously bad product that nobody
IErvIekMD3U,962880,964880,needed and hey if you like being told
IErvIekMD3U,964880,967759,which tech products to definitely not bi
IErvIekMD3U,967759,970079,then a sub to the channel would be
IErvIekMD3U,970079,972560,intoxicating
IErvIekMD3U,972560,974720,now it's not very often that we see a
IErvIekMD3U,974720,978000,viral game on the scale of hq trivia it
IErvIekMD3U,978000,980160,was a novel concept for sure you could
IErvIekMD3U,980160,982240,use your smartphone to not just watch a
IErvIekMD3U,982240,984880,game show but actually participate in it
IErvIekMD3U,984880,986320,everyone would tune in at a specific
IErvIekMD3U,986320,988480,time they'd be met with an actual game
IErvIekMD3U,988480,990800,host sometimes a guest celebrity host
IErvIekMD3U,990800,992240,like the rock it would feel like they
IErvIekMD3U,992240,994399,were talking directly to you and if you
IErvIekMD3U,994399,996079,could correctly answer 12 questions in a
IErvIekMD3U,996079,997759,row you would be a winner and you would
IErvIekMD3U,997759,1000079,get an actual cash prize split with
IErvIekMD3U,1000079,1002000,anyone else who'd also done the same
IErvIekMD3U,1002000,1004639,this was a game like no other being a
IErvIekMD3U,1004639,1006320,live experience competing directly
IErvIekMD3U,1006320,1008079,against others only having 10 seconds
IErvIekMD3U,1008079,1009920,per question having an actual cash
IErvIekMD3U,1009920,1012160,reward at the end the level of tension
IErvIekMD3U,1012160,1015279,this could drive was off the charts like
IErvIekMD3U,1015279,1016320,this was someone's reaction after
IErvIekMD3U,1016320,1018880,winning just 11 on this game
IErvIekMD3U,1018880,1020720,the difficulty though with paying the
IErvIekMD3U,1020720,1022639,winners real money is that
IErvIekMD3U,1022639,1024079,you've got to get that money from
IErvIekMD3U,1024079,1025918,somewhere and so as the number of users
IErvIekMD3U,1025918,1028319,skyrocketed the app just couldn't keep
IErvIekMD3U,1028319,1030240,up with the funding and so you were
IErvIekMD3U,1030240,1031600,getting to a stage where even though one
IErvIekMD3U,1031600,1034400,quiz might have had a 100 000 prize pool
IErvIekMD3U,1034400,1035839,with the amount of players who ended up
IErvIekMD3U,1035839,1037760,winning each one might have only ended
IErvIekMD3U,1037760,1040480,up taking home like two dollars so the
IErvIekMD3U,1040480,1042880,sheer stakes that the app initially had
IErvIekMD3U,1042880,1045199,started to lose their appeal and the app
IErvIekMD3U,1045199,1047520,actually hosted one final quiz with two
IErvIekMD3U,1047520,1049840,hosts who were both completely drunk who
IErvIekMD3U,1049840,1052000,started swearing at the crowd only then
IErvIekMD3U,1052000,1053440,to reveal part way through that the
IErvIekMD3U,1053440,1055760,total prize money for that quiz was just
IErvIekMD3U,1055760,1057440,five dollars because they'd run out of
IErvIekMD3U,1057440,1060480,cash five dollars split between the 500
IErvIekMD3U,1060480,1062080,winners
IErvIekMD3U,1062080,1064160,was one cent each
IErvIekMD3U,1064160,1066320,what a way to go six out of ten just
IErvIekMD3U,1066320,1067919,because of how fast this went from
IErvIekMD3U,1067919,1070640,phenomenon to bankrupt you've heard of
IErvIekMD3U,1070640,1072880,twitch right the game live streaming
IErvIekMD3U,1072880,1074720,platform that's absolutely flying right
IErvIekMD3U,1074720,1075520,now
IErvIekMD3U,1075520,1077760,but how much do you know about mixer
IErvIekMD3U,1077760,1080480,microsoft's answer to twitch microsoft
IErvIekMD3U,1080480,1082160,correctly predicted that gaming was a
IErvIekMD3U,1082160,1084480,huge and growing market and so their
IErvIekMD3U,1084480,1085760,whole idea was to basically make
IErvIekMD3U,1085760,1087919,something that was just like twitch but
IErvIekMD3U,1087919,1090160,with higher quality streaming the thing
IErvIekMD3U,1090160,1092640,is though it is really really hard to
IErvIekMD3U,1092640,1094640,get audiences to shift social media
IErvIekMD3U,1094640,1096720,platforms microsoft overlooked the fact
IErvIekMD3U,1096720,1098320,that viewers aren't just there for the
IErvIekMD3U,1098320,1099919,content each platform has its own
IErvIekMD3U,1099919,1102160,communities a sense of belonging and
IErvIekMD3U,1102160,1105039,really its own language so
IErvIekMD3U,1105039,1107200,no one joined mixer and when microsoft
IErvIekMD3U,1107200,1108799,realized that organically building their
IErvIekMD3U,1108799,1111200,own audience was really tough they tried
IErvIekMD3U,1111200,1114640,to buy one in 2019 they announced a deal
IErvIekMD3U,1114640,1117360,that i think it's fair to say shook the
IErvIekMD3U,1117360,1119600,gaming world they basically played two
IErvIekMD3U,1119600,1121600,of the biggest streamers on twitch
IErvIekMD3U,1121600,1124000,shroud and ninja an obscene amount of
IErvIekMD3U,1124000,1125919,money we're talking 10 million dollars
IErvIekMD3U,1125919,1128480,and 30 million dollars to quit twitch
IErvIekMD3U,1128480,1131679,and now post exclusively on mixer but
IErvIekMD3U,1131679,1133200,even though this did bring in some new
IErvIekMD3U,1133200,1135280,users it was far from enough to start a
IErvIekMD3U,1135280,1137200,new community so
IErvIekMD3U,1137200,1139200,mixer died but the funny part of it is
IErvIekMD3U,1139200,1140720,that these streamers that they paid
IErvIekMD3U,1140720,1143039,piles of cash to got to keep the money
IErvIekMD3U,1143039,1144960,and were then free to go back to twitch
IErvIekMD3U,1144960,1146080,again
IErvIekMD3U,1146080,1148960,six out of ten
IErvIekMD3U,1149360,1150559,what a mess
IErvIekMD3U,1150559,1152480,oh but microsoft is actually really good
IErvIekMD3U,1152480,1154320,at fails
IErvIekMD3U,1154320,1156240,it must be contagious because they've
IErvIekMD3U,1156240,1159280,also secured a place in the top five
IErvIekMD3U,1159280,1161760,with skype okay so you know how pretty
IErvIekMD3U,1161760,1163280,much everyone now when they want to
IErvIekMD3U,1163280,1165280,video conference someone school classes
IErvIekMD3U,1165280,1167919,university lectures work meetings we use
IErvIekMD3U,1167919,1169440,zoom right
IErvIekMD3U,1169440,1171280,well did you ever wonder what happened
IErvIekMD3U,1171280,1174240,to skype i remember the year 2011 when
IErvIekMD3U,1174240,1176640,skype was king they were so far ahead
IErvIekMD3U,1176640,1178640,that their name was all but synonymous
IErvIekMD3U,1178640,1180400,with the term video call it was
IErvIekMD3U,1180400,1182559,literally a verb but then they got
IErvIekMD3U,1182559,1185280,bought by microsoft who long story short
IErvIekMD3U,1185280,1187679,got very complacent they knew skype was
IErvIekMD3U,1187679,1189760,ahead in the calling experience but
IErvIekMD3U,1189760,1191840,instead of reinvesting to keep it ahead
IErvIekMD3U,1191840,1193760,they instead spent all their efforts
IErvIekMD3U,1193760,1195840,bedazzling the rest of the app bloating
IErvIekMD3U,1195840,1198000,it with updates and features that no one
IErvIekMD3U,1198000,1200080,really wanted and slowly but surely
IErvIekMD3U,1200080,1201600,allowing the competitors to overtake
IErvIekMD3U,1201600,1203440,them in what mattered
IErvIekMD3U,1203440,1205679,video quality they missed the fact that
IErvIekMD3U,1205679,1207600,people didn't want to use skype as a
IErvIekMD3U,1207600,1209440,social media platform they just wanted
IErvIekMD3U,1209440,1211039,to send a link to someone be able to
IErvIekMD3U,1211039,1213360,have a clean uninterrupted video call
IErvIekMD3U,1213360,1215280,and then move on with their life and
IErvIekMD3U,1215280,1217440,zoom just did this way better and so
IErvIekMD3U,1217440,1218880,over the years zoom's market share has
IErvIekMD3U,1218880,1220799,been trickling up while skype's
IErvIekMD3U,1220799,1223039,trickling down but as soon as the
IErvIekMD3U,1223039,1225840,pandemic hit this trend was catalyzed to
IErvIekMD3U,1225840,1227440,the extreme all of a sudden you had
IErvIekMD3U,1227440,1229120,floods of people searching or asking
IErvIekMD3U,1229120,1230400,their friends what's the best
IErvIekMD3U,1230400,1232400,conferencing app only to hear zoom and
IErvIekMD3U,1232400,1234640,then proceeding to download it within a
IErvIekMD3U,1234640,1236799,few short weeks zoom
IErvIekMD3U,1236799,1239200,zoomed ahead from 100 000 downloads a
IErvIekMD3U,1239200,1242960,day to 3 million and i think this sudden
IErvIekMD3U,1242960,1244960,surge has been enough to cement zoom as
IErvIekMD3U,1244960,1247440,the default and bury skype is a legacy
IErvIekMD3U,1247440,1250400,platform given that microsoft paid 8.5
IErvIekMD3U,1250400,1252400,billion dollars for skype and they
IErvIekMD3U,1252400,1253760,scuppered the entire thing within a
IErvIekMD3U,1253760,1256480,decade this is an enormous failing
IErvIekMD3U,1256480,1259440,worthy of a seven out of ten
IErvIekMD3U,1259440,1261440,now this number four
IErvIekMD3U,1261440,1263280,i was not expecting to put this high up
IErvIekMD3U,1263280,1264960,on the list on the face of it it's just
IErvIekMD3U,1264960,1267280,yet another run-of-the-mill failure but
IErvIekMD3U,1267280,1269039,the more i've looked into it the more i
IErvIekMD3U,1269039,1271600,am genuinely in shock at how this
IErvIekMD3U,1271600,1272640,happened
IErvIekMD3U,1272640,1275120,picture this it's 2009. we've just had
IErvIekMD3U,1275120,1277039,the iphone 3gs early androids are
IErvIekMD3U,1277039,1278880,starting to emerge and smartphones are
IErvIekMD3U,1278880,1281280,just starting to lift off so
IErvIekMD3U,1281280,1283280,a company called pique who'd previously
IErvIekMD3U,1283280,1285360,seen success with a device that only run
IErvIekMD3U,1285360,1288480,emails decides to release a 200 handheld
IErvIekMD3U,1288480,1289440,device
IErvIekMD3U,1289440,1292080,that only ran twitter not a smartphone
IErvIekMD3U,1292080,1293840,let's be very clear about that this did
IErvIekMD3U,1293840,1295120,one thing
IErvIekMD3U,1295120,1297280,and it did that one thing poorly you'd
IErvIekMD3U,1297280,1299440,see all your tweets organized in a list
IErvIekMD3U,1299440,1302080,but in this list you could only read the
IErvIekMD3U,1302080,1304720,first three or four words of each tweet
IErvIekMD3U,1304720,1306320,any linked websites that took you off
IErvIekMD3U,1306320,1308400,twitter were practically inaccessible it
IErvIekMD3U,1308400,1311120,was incredibly slow but even more tragic
IErvIekMD3U,1311120,1312080,than that
IErvIekMD3U,1312080,1313679,it could only ever keep the 10 most
IErvIekMD3U,1313679,1316080,recent tweets on it at any time if you
IErvIekMD3U,1316080,1318080,had more than that which let's be honest
IErvIekMD3U,1318080,1319520,someone buying a dedicated twitter
IErvIekMD3U,1319520,1321679,handheld probably would you had to use
IErvIekMD3U,1321679,1322799,your pc
IErvIekMD3U,1322799,1325360,or you would lose them i mean this fail
IErvIekMD3U,1325360,1327520,isn't putting anyone at risk no one's
IErvIekMD3U,1327520,1329360,losing billions of dollars but i'm
IErvIekMD3U,1329360,1331280,giving it a 7 out of 10 because of how
IErvIekMD3U,1331280,1334159,unbelievably stupid it is gizmodo
IErvIekMD3U,1334159,1336000,labeled it so dumb it makes my brain
IErvIekMD3U,1336000,1338080,hurt tedcrunch said they were sure this
IErvIekMD3U,1338080,1339600,would be relegated in the dustbin of
IErvIekMD3U,1339600,1344000,history i couldn't agree more
IErvIekMD3U,1344720,1346720,okay three you know if you ask most
IErvIekMD3U,1346720,1348720,people what apple's biggest mistake was
IErvIekMD3U,1348720,1351600,they'd probably say oh apple maps or the
IErvIekMD3U,1351600,1354000,mac pro they look like a trash can or
IErvIekMD3U,1354000,1355600,those socks they tried to sell people to
IErvIekMD3U,1355600,1358159,keep their ipods in but actually i think
IErvIekMD3U,1358159,1360240,apple's biggest most alarming and
IErvIekMD3U,1360240,1362880,dangerous fail was the facetime bug of
IErvIekMD3U,1362880,1365440,2019. if you started a facetime call
IErvIekMD3U,1365440,1367440,with someone and used a really easy
IErvIekMD3U,1367440,1369280,loophole to make it a group call by just
IErvIekMD3U,1369280,1371039,adding your own number into it this
IErvIekMD3U,1371039,1372720,would trick apple into thinking the
IErvIekMD3U,1372720,1374640,other person had answered the call just
IErvIekMD3U,1374640,1376320,to be very clear without their
IErvIekMD3U,1376320,1378159,permission with just a phone number
IErvIekMD3U,1378159,1380240,you'd be able to hear and see what
IErvIekMD3U,1380240,1382240,someone else's phone was seeing and
IErvIekMD3U,1382240,1384640,hearing
IErvIekMD3U,1384640,1386240,it was giving potentially a complete
IErvIekMD3U,1386240,1389200,stranger a window into your life that is
IErvIekMD3U,1389200,1391760,like a proper top-tier security risk
IErvIekMD3U,1391760,1393600,good reminder though of how much trust
IErvIekMD3U,1393600,1396559,we are putting into these companies
IErvIekMD3U,1396559,1398720,eight out of ten on the fail scale okay
IErvIekMD3U,1398720,1400159,at this point you've probably heard of
IErvIekMD3U,1400159,1403280,cryptocurrencies basically virtual money
IErvIekMD3U,1403280,1405039,and in this new world you have
IErvIekMD3U,1405039,1406799,legitimate cryptocurrencies that are
IErvIekMD3U,1406799,1409280,founded on strong watertight principles
IErvIekMD3U,1409280,1411280,and you also have scam cryptocurrencies
IErvIekMD3U,1411280,1413440,created by people to fool others into
IErvIekMD3U,1413440,1415200,investing in them and
IErvIekMD3U,1415200,1417120,we've just seen one of the worst ones
IErvIekMD3U,1417120,1418000,ever
IErvIekMD3U,1418000,1419440,squid game
IErvIekMD3U,1419440,1421200,yeah the netflix show if you haven't
IErvIekMD3U,1421200,1422559,watched it you'll at least have heard
IErvIekMD3U,1422559,1425279,about it this show broke so many records
IErvIekMD3U,1425279,1427039,that netflix actually decided to change
IErvIekMD3U,1427039,1428799,their entire metrics for measuring
IErvIekMD3U,1428799,1430799,viewership and for a few weeks it felt
IErvIekMD3U,1430799,1432480,like the entire world was just riding
IErvIekMD3U,1432480,1434559,this wave of squid game everything
IErvIekMD3U,1434559,1436480,people made squid game themed videos
IErvIekMD3U,1436480,1438240,they ate squid game themed food they
IErvIekMD3U,1438240,1440640,hosted squid game themed parties well
IErvIekMD3U,1440640,1442400,hey that's one party that i'm glad i
IErvIekMD3U,1442400,1445919,wasn't invited to but also invested in a
IErvIekMD3U,1445919,1448559,squid game themed cryptocurrency now
IErvIekMD3U,1448559,1450080,this was not official it wasn't created
IErvIekMD3U,1450080,1452080,by netflix but the people who made it
IErvIekMD3U,1452080,1454240,did make it seem legit the starting
IErvIekMD3U,1454240,1456640,price was one cent per coin and almost
IErvIekMD3U,1456640,1459039,immediately people piled on all rushing
IErvIekMD3U,1459039,1460960,in and buying expecting the value to go
IErvIekMD3U,1460960,1462480,up so they could sell and make a quick
IErvIekMD3U,1462480,1464880,buck and sure enough within a few days
IErvIekMD3U,1464880,1467760,it flew all the way to 30
IErvIekMD3U,1467760,1469919,a coin then within a week managed to hit
IErvIekMD3U,1469919,1472400,an all-time high of 2
IErvIekMD3U,1472400,1473919,800
IErvIekMD3U,1473919,1475679,to put this another way if i'd spent
IErvIekMD3U,1475679,1478400,just 50 on squid coin at the start i'd
IErvIekMD3U,1478400,1479840,have turned that 50
IErvIekMD3U,1479840,1482080,into 14 million
IErvIekMD3U,1482080,1484080,but then people realized something that
IErvIekMD3U,1484080,1485760,unlike with most cryptos where you can
IErvIekMD3U,1485760,1487600,buy and sell freely if you wanted to
IErvIekMD3U,1487600,1490000,convert your squid coin back to dollars
IErvIekMD3U,1490000,1491600,you had to play a game
IErvIekMD3U,1491600,1492480,and
IErvIekMD3U,1492480,1494000,the game
IErvIekMD3U,1494000,1494880,didn't
IErvIekMD3U,1494880,1496960,exist the developers had promised that
IErvIekMD3U,1496960,1498799,they were working on it but it very
IErvIekMD3U,1498799,1500720,quickly became apparent that they
IErvIekMD3U,1500720,1503200,weren't and you've probably never seen
IErvIekMD3U,1503200,1504880,anything like the fallout that came
IErvIekMD3U,1504880,1507120,after this within five minutes of the
IErvIekMD3U,1507120,1509919,scan being outed five minutes squid coin
IErvIekMD3U,1509919,1511520,dropped from two thousand eight hundred
IErvIekMD3U,1511520,1515200,dollars to zero 0.00079
IErvIekMD3U,1515200,1517360,or in other words your suite 14 million
IErvIekMD3U,1517360,1519840,dollars would become less than four
IErvIekMD3U,1519840,1522000,dollars it wasn't really a failure on
IErvIekMD3U,1522000,1523440,the developer's end they walked away
IErvIekMD3U,1523440,1525679,with full pockets and still no one knows
IErvIekMD3U,1525679,1527440,who they are thanks to the anonymity of
IErvIekMD3U,1527440,1530080,crypto but for the over eager investors
IErvIekMD3U,1530080,1532320,who didn't do their research they lost
IErvIekMD3U,1532320,1535520,everything a huge nine out of ten fail
IErvIekMD3U,1535520,1536240,but
IErvIekMD3U,1536240,1538480,still not on the scale of number one
IErvIekMD3U,1538480,1540240,and just before number one do remember
IErvIekMD3U,1540240,1542080,that if your favorite fail isn't on this
IErvIekMD3U,1542080,1544000,list i do have a whole series of tech
IErvIekMD3U,1544000,1546559,fails i will link them after this one
IErvIekMD3U,1546559,1547520,okay
IErvIekMD3U,1547520,1549679,we all love a revolution don't we when
IErvIekMD3U,1549679,1550640,someone comes and says that they're
IErvIekMD3U,1550640,1552720,going to completely redefine something
IErvIekMD3U,1552720,1555279,it's an easy thing to root for well this
IErvIekMD3U,1555279,1557840,is exactly what dr ruja ignatova
IErvIekMD3U,1557840,1560080,capitalized on she was a strong promoter
IErvIekMD3U,1560080,1562159,of cryptocurrencies and how they take
IErvIekMD3U,1562159,1563600,power away from the banks and give them
IErvIekMD3U,1563600,1565679,to the people but she felt like the
IErvIekMD3U,1565679,1568240,current leading crypto bitcoin just
IErvIekMD3U,1568240,1571520,wasn't quite right so came up with one
IErvIekMD3U,1571520,1575520,coin bigger better and easier to use
IErvIekMD3U,1575520,1577360,a revolution she basically took the
IErvIekMD3U,1577360,1579200,things that bitcoin does exaggerated
IErvIekMD3U,1579200,1581679,them and then made those the features of
IErvIekMD3U,1581679,1583840,onecoin for example bitcoin payments
IErvIekMD3U,1583840,1586240,take 10 minutes to arrive one coin would
IErvIekMD3U,1586240,1589200,take just one minute and she seemed
IErvIekMD3U,1589200,1591279,legit she studied at oxford she had a
IErvIekMD3U,1591279,1593440,phd a successful career she was on the
IErvIekMD3U,1593440,1595200,front page of forbes the trust pilot
IErvIekMD3U,1595200,1597360,reviews for onecoin were overwhelmingly
IErvIekMD3U,1597360,1600080,positive people didn't have a reason to
IErvIekMD3U,1600080,1602400,not believe her so
IErvIekMD3U,1602400,1604240,money started pouring in and i don't
IErvIekMD3U,1604240,1607039,mean a few million 15 billion dollars
IErvIekMD3U,1607039,1608960,worth of cash was invested by people all
IErvIekMD3U,1608960,1610640,around the world she got everyone from
IErvIekMD3U,1610640,1612320,the richest to the poorest people
IErvIekMD3U,1612320,1614240,investing in onecoin people sold their
IErvIekMD3U,1614240,1615679,farms and their houses said they could
IErvIekMD3U,1615679,1618000,be a part of it and then
IErvIekMD3U,1618000,1620799,she disappeared one day in 2017 she was
IErvIekMD3U,1620799,1623039,meant to be on stage speaking in lisbon
IErvIekMD3U,1623039,1625520,and she just didn't show up no one has
IErvIekMD3U,1625520,1628000,seen her since because it turns out that
IErvIekMD3U,1628000,1631039,onecoin was actually a pyramid scheme
IErvIekMD3U,1631039,1633039,ruja and the people she'd hired would
IErvIekMD3U,1633039,1634720,travel around the world brainwashing
IErvIekMD3U,1634720,1636559,people into putting their cash into her
IErvIekMD3U,1636559,1639360,currency and then convincing them to get
IErvIekMD3U,1639360,1640480,others on board
IErvIekMD3U,1640480,1642480,they created a system such that if an
IErvIekMD3U,1642480,1644080,investor could get another investor on
IErvIekMD3U,1644080,1646240,board they would get a commission on
IErvIekMD3U,1646240,1648159,that and likewise if that new investor
IErvIekMD3U,1648159,1649840,could then get another investor in board
IErvIekMD3U,1649840,1652480,they'd get a commission too so onecoin
IErvIekMD3U,1652480,1654799,had an almost cult-like following
IErvIekMD3U,1654799,1656640,everyone who was in it had a very strong
IErvIekMD3U,1656640,1659200,incentive to make sure it succeeded
IErvIekMD3U,1659200,1661520,the slight complication being that
IErvIekMD3U,1661520,1663600,onecoin was not actually a proper
IErvIekMD3U,1663600,1665600,cryptocurrency ruger said that the
IErvIekMD3U,1665600,1667039,reason it was better than bitcoin was
IErvIekMD3U,1667039,1669039,because it was based on its own unique
IErvIekMD3U,1669039,1671520,blockchain technology except what that
IErvIekMD3U,1671520,1673840,actually meant was it wasn't blockchain
IErvIekMD3U,1673840,1676000,at all it's like me saying oh this
IErvIekMD3U,1676000,1677919,iphone costs a hundred dollars and
IErvIekMD3U,1677919,1679279,that's because it's running on my own
IErvIekMD3U,1679279,1681039,version of ios
IErvIekMD3U,1681039,1684480,which isn't actually ios and as a result
IErvIekMD3U,1684480,1686799,you couldn't actually use onecoin to buy
IErvIekMD3U,1686799,1689520,anything and this is presumably why
IErvIekMD3U,1689520,1691440,ruger disappeared she knew that it would
IErvIekMD3U,1691440,1693279,catch up to her eventually and so she
IErvIekMD3U,1693279,1695360,vanished before it did what i think is
IErvIekMD3U,1695360,1696480,really interesting about this case is
IErvIekMD3U,1696480,1697840,that if you knew what you were looking
IErvIekMD3U,1697840,1699679,for the red flags were all there from
IErvIekMD3U,1699679,1701840,the start her being on the front page of
IErvIekMD3U,1701840,1704159,forbes was actually fabricated to give
IErvIekMD3U,1704159,1706399,her more credibility the website was
IErvIekMD3U,1706399,1708559,rife with grammatical errors even in one
IErvIekMD3U,1708559,1711039,instance spelling cryptocurrency with an
IErvIekMD3U,1711039,1713360,i all those trust pilot reviews onecoin
IErvIekMD3U,1713360,1714320,had
IErvIekMD3U,1714320,1717840,they'd all been left in one single month
IErvIekMD3U,1717840,1719200,fake reviews
IErvIekMD3U,1719200,1721919,people lost everything this was a
IErvIekMD3U,1721919,1724640,horrific fail on a scale that crypto had
IErvIekMD3U,1724640,1727279,never seen before and i hope we'll never
IErvIekMD3U,1727279,1729200,see again
IErvIekMD3U,1729200,1731919,10 out of 10.
