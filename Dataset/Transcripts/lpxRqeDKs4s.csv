lpxRqeDKs4s,0,1680,you don't always have to take upcycling
lpxRqeDKs4s,1680,4160,to the extreme that i'm doing it but
lpxRqeDKs4s,4160,5920,look at the things that you have i think
lpxRqeDKs4s,5920,9040,we're so easily throwing things away and
lpxRqeDKs4s,9040,12760,there's so much potential
lpxRqeDKs4s,16240,20080,diy fashion is a mix of so many cool
lpxRqeDKs4s,20080,22240,things i'd say it's a lot of being
lpxRqeDKs4s,22240,24640,resourceful kind of using what you have
lpxRqeDKs4s,24640,25760,available
lpxRqeDKs4s,25760,28480,it's creative it's exciting
lpxRqeDKs4s,28480,30800,and now i have a little bag and it's
lpxRqeDKs4s,30800,32640,always different i think for everybody
lpxRqeDKs4s,32640,35280,that does it
lpxRqeDKs4s,36480,39600,for the past year i have been the design
lpxRqeDKs4s,39600,42160,ambassador for arterix which has been so
lpxRqeDKs4s,42160,44239,exciting my work with them is really to
lpxRqeDKs4s,44239,47280,focus on used product and try to find
lpxRqeDKs4s,47280,49760,another way to use it the coolest thing
lpxRqeDKs4s,49760,52160,to me is the shape of their garments
lpxRqeDKs4s,52160,54480,when they're hanging on a hanger a lot
lpxRqeDKs4s,54480,56000,of the time product when it's just
lpxRqeDKs4s,56000,58239,sitting there like not on a body it
lpxRqeDKs4s,58239,60480,loses the structure of it it kind of
lpxRqeDKs4s,60480,62800,loses the experience
lpxRqeDKs4s,62800,64478,but with our turks you still see the
lpxRqeDKs4s,64478,66400,shape and it just makes you want to put
lpxRqeDKs4s,66400,67060,it on
lpxRqeDKs4s,67060,69920,[Music]
lpxRqeDKs4s,69920,71840,it's been good i look at it as more of a
lpxRqeDKs4s,71840,74640,portfolio and to be able to almost have
lpxRqeDKs4s,74640,76159,an archive
lpxRqeDKs4s,76159,78400,i tend to take apart the pieces that i
lpxRqeDKs4s,78400,80720,make to be able to upcycle it again and
lpxRqeDKs4s,80720,82560,again so that's why i don't have like a
lpxRqeDKs4s,82560,84720,huge archive of the pieces that i've
lpxRqeDKs4s,84720,87119,made so it's cool that my instagram has
lpxRqeDKs4s,87119,88720,become a place where it's the archive
lpxRqeDKs4s,88720,90240,its pieces and like that's what i
lpxRqeDKs4s,90240,92470,consider the final piece to be
lpxRqeDKs4s,92470,95280,[Music]
lpxRqeDKs4s,95280,97600,i was really just kind of interested in
lpxRqeDKs4s,97600,99280,how things were made and i think that
lpxRqeDKs4s,99280,101200,was what made me realize that i love
lpxRqeDKs4s,101200,103520,using garments and things that already
lpxRqeDKs4s,103520,106240,exist already have shape and personality
lpxRqeDKs4s,106240,107600,to them
lpxRqeDKs4s,107600,109200,just learning how to create through
lpxRqeDKs4s,109200,111280,using upcycling it just was so many
lpxRqeDKs4s,111280,114280,possibilities
lpxRqeDKs4s,115520,118000,i get inspired by a lot of sport and
lpxRqeDKs4s,118000,120560,sporting equipment i love rock climbing
lpxRqeDKs4s,120560,123360,and so that's a huge inspiration for me
lpxRqeDKs4s,123360,125280,technical clothing things that really
lpxRqeDKs4s,125280,127439,serve a purpose and a function trying to
lpxRqeDKs4s,127439,130160,find the most with one garment pockets
lpxRqeDKs4s,130160,131440,and zippers
lpxRqeDKs4s,131440,133040,those are the things that inspire my
lpxRqeDKs4s,133040,135650,work the most
lpxRqeDKs4s,135650,137040,[Applause]
lpxRqeDKs4s,137040,139040,the time that it takes to make the
lpxRqeDKs4s,139040,142319,pieces usually isn't as long as it is to
lpxRqeDKs4s,142319,144480,think of the idea and to photograph it
lpxRqeDKs4s,144480,146480,but i'd say no more than like
lpxRqeDKs4s,146480,149599,four to six hours
lpxRqeDKs4s,150800,153120,i want to talk about the volleyball shoe
lpxRqeDKs4s,153120,155200,that i made a couple years ago that was
lpxRqeDKs4s,155200,156959,probably one of my favorite projects
lpxRqeDKs4s,156959,160480,because it was the first time that i saw
lpxRqeDKs4s,160480,162239,the transformation that's this
lpxRqeDKs4s,162239,163840,volleyball that's it's meant to play a
lpxRqeDKs4s,163840,166160,sport it's not meant to be anything else
lpxRqeDKs4s,166160,167040,and i
lpxRqeDKs4s,167040,169519,turned it into a wearable slipper and it
lpxRqeDKs4s,169519,171360,was comfortable and the colors were
lpxRqeDKs4s,171360,173440,amazing and i was like there's just so
lpxRqeDKs4s,173440,174720,much potential here so that was
lpxRqeDKs4s,174720,176800,definitely the project that catapulted
lpxRqeDKs4s,176800,178010,me into this
lpxRqeDKs4s,178010,181090,[Music]
lpxRqeDKs4s,181519,184000,if you have a crazy wild idea try to
lpxRqeDKs4s,184000,186000,make it you don't always have to have
lpxRqeDKs4s,186000,188000,all the tools and the machines and the
lpxRqeDKs4s,188000,189760,knowledge to be able to make something
lpxRqeDKs4s,189760,190959,great
lpxRqeDKs4s,190959,192720,look into your closet try to find
lpxRqeDKs4s,192720,194159,something that you haven't worn in a
lpxRqeDKs4s,194159,196080,while and try to find a way to be able
lpxRqeDKs4s,196080,199840,to make it exciting again
lpxRqeDKs4s,201120,203840,people just using second-hand materials
lpxRqeDKs4s,203840,206560,using what we already have existing on
lpxRqeDKs4s,206560,209040,earth there's just so much available and
lpxRqeDKs4s,209040,211519,there's just so many resources that we
lpxRqeDKs4s,211519,214799,tend to overlook i see a lot of you know
lpxRqeDKs4s,214799,217200,no waste designers now customize their
lpxRqeDKs4s,217200,219120,closet customize their looks it's
lpxRqeDKs4s,219120,221060,exciting
lpxRqeDKs4s,221060,223599,[Music]
lpxRqeDKs4s,223599,225360,look at the things that you have i think
lpxRqeDKs4s,225360,226560,we're so
lpxRqeDKs4s,226560,227840,easily
lpxRqeDKs4s,227840,229680,throwing things away you don't always
lpxRqeDKs4s,229680,231920,have to take upcycling to the extreme
lpxRqeDKs4s,231920,234159,that i'm doing it but if you crop
lpxRqeDKs4s,234159,236640,something then take the scraps and try
lpxRqeDKs4s,236640,239360,to find a way to make a bag out of it or
lpxRqeDKs4s,239360,241200,make a headband out of it and learning
lpxRqeDKs4s,241200,242879,how to sew i mean that's an underrated
lpxRqeDKs4s,242879,245040,skill but learning how to sew and being
lpxRqeDKs4s,245040,247040,able to customize it to yourself i think
lpxRqeDKs4s,247040,249040,is a really great skill to have
lpxRqeDKs4s,249040,250640,those are good questions
lpxRqeDKs4s,250640,252879,they had me thinking so the energy was
lpxRqeDKs4s,252879,254159,like kind of fast so i didn't have to
lpxRqeDKs4s,254159,256479,think like too hard about it in a good
lpxRqeDKs4s,256479,258880,way
