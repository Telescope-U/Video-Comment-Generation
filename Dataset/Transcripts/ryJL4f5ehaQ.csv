ryJL4f5ehaQ,0,3600,i've had the good fortune of uh
ryJL4f5ehaQ,3600,6560,living the american dream
ryJL4f5ehaQ,6560,9280,i just kind of had an itching to go run
ryJL4f5ehaQ,9280,10880,my own thing you know the only way you
ryJL4f5ehaQ,10880,13200,could be a failure is not to fail to be
ryJL4f5ehaQ,13200,14960,honest with you the first company i went
ryJL4f5ehaQ,14960,16480,was a total disaster
ryJL4f5ehaQ,16480,18400,it was like running a 100 yard dash and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,18400,20720,being smacked in the face with a 2x4
ryJL4f5ehaQ,20720,23039,i'll never forget i was my second day on
ryJL4f5ehaQ,23039,25279,the job the ceo said keith i want you to
ryJL4f5ehaQ,25279,27359,say this at the next board meeting and i
ryJL4f5ehaQ,27359,29599,go maria i will not say that that would
ryJL4f5ehaQ,29599,31760,be lie you get that big bit in your
ryJL4f5ehaQ,31760,34160,stomach and you just turn warm inside i
ryJL4f5ehaQ,34160,36880,just made the biggest mistake of my life
ryJL4f5ehaQ,36880,39280,you know obviously i my drive comes from
ryJL4f5ehaQ,39280,41360,my upbringing and it's about paying it
ryJL4f5ehaQ,41360,43360,forward and giving it back you know one
ryJL4f5ehaQ,43360,44960,of the things my dad always said is the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,44960,46719,key is when the world hands you a sack
ryJL4f5ehaQ,46719,49360,of sour lemons the objective of the game
ryJL4f5ehaQ,49360,51360,is alternative sweet lemonade
ryJL4f5ehaQ,51360,52960,and i was fortunate enough to be able to
ryJL4f5ehaQ,52960,54960,do that and and i ended up hooking up
ryJL4f5ehaQ,54960,57360,with three phd scientists from the ibm
ryJL4f5ehaQ,57360,59039,research labs
ryJL4f5ehaQ,59039,61280,that had a technology it would change
ryJL4f5ehaQ,61280,63120,the way mechanical engineering was done
ryJL4f5ehaQ,63120,65198,and it took about two and a half years
ryJL4f5ehaQ,65198,67760,but uh but it worked and we changed the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,67760,69760,way mechanical engineering is done with
ryJL4f5ehaQ,69760,71200,with that software from rats and we
ryJL4f5ehaQ,71200,72479,created a thing called
ryJL4f5ehaQ,72479,74720,mechanical design synthesis and design
ryJL4f5ehaQ,74720,77040,optimization uh we were all set to take
ryJL4f5ehaQ,77040,78880,it public and then a company called
ryJL4f5ehaQ,78880,80400,technology came in
ryJL4f5ehaQ,80400,82640,and and bought it from us so let's talk
ryJL4f5ehaQ,82640,84560,about ariba so ariba starts right after
ryJL4f5ehaQ,84560,86960,rasna our revenue doubled quarter over
ryJL4f5ehaQ,86960,89600,quarter for 12 quarters in a row
ryJL4f5ehaQ,89600,91759,uh we took it you know we took it public
ryJL4f5ehaQ,91759,93840,after two and three quarters years
ryJL4f5ehaQ,93840,97280,got up to 40 billion and to this day 3.7
ryJL4f5ehaQ,97280,100400,trillion of transactions go trillion
ryJL4f5ehaQ,100400,101680,more than all the trade in the western
ryJL4f5ehaQ,101680,104399,hemisphere more than ebay alibaba and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,104399,106640,amazon combined go through that ariba
ryJL4f5ehaQ,106640,109520,network the lesson i learned
ryJL4f5ehaQ,109520,111119,and it was always straight in front of
ryJL4f5ehaQ,111119,112560,my face
ryJL4f5ehaQ,112560,114240,you know i grew up in the midwest great
ryJL4f5ehaQ,114240,117840,midwestern values uh integrity was key
ryJL4f5ehaQ,117840,120320,same at general motors purdue all of
ryJL4f5ehaQ,120320,121439,that
ryJL4f5ehaQ,121439,124320,and it was a different value system so
ryJL4f5ehaQ,124320,126399,from there on out
ryJL4f5ehaQ,126399,128399,always job was to make sure every
ryJL4f5ehaQ,128399,131039,organization every company
ryJL4f5ehaQ,131039,133440,had a great set of values and integrity
ryJL4f5ehaQ,133440,134319,because
ryJL4f5ehaQ,134319,136160,people can say hey i don't like how you
ryJL4f5ehaQ,136160,137840,look i don't like where you went to
ryJL4f5ehaQ,137840,138959,school but they can't take your
ryJL4f5ehaQ,138959,141360,integrity away
ryJL4f5ehaQ,141360,142879,you know it's a tremendous honor to be
ryJL4f5ehaQ,142879,144239,here
ryJL4f5ehaQ,144239,145760,this truly is
ryJL4f5ehaQ,145760,148000,my happy place
ryJL4f5ehaQ,148000,149920,and so for the class
ryJL4f5ehaQ,149920,152800,of 2021
ryJL4f5ehaQ,152800,153519,and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,153519,155680,your parents your families and your
ryJL4f5ehaQ,155680,156480,friends
ryJL4f5ehaQ,156480,157599,i just
ryJL4f5ehaQ,157599,160400,have one question for you
ryJL4f5ehaQ,160400,163840,is purdue the greatest university or
ryJL4f5ehaQ,163840,166160,what
ryJL4f5ehaQ,168480,171840,first of all you got to trust yourself
ryJL4f5ehaQ,171840,173040,and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,173040,174560,you know that's
ryJL4f5ehaQ,174560,175920,because you can't trust anybody else
ryJL4f5ehaQ,175920,178080,unless you trust yourself and you know i
ryJL4f5ehaQ,178080,179040,found
ryJL4f5ehaQ,179040,180879,a way to build that trust is keep
ryJL4f5ehaQ,180879,182560,jumping in water over your head but i we
ryJL4f5ehaQ,182560,185040,can come back to that but um
ryJL4f5ehaQ,185040,185920,so
ryJL4f5ehaQ,185920,187760,you go into a new environment go into a
ryJL4f5ehaQ,187760,190159,new company uh something like that so
ryJL4f5ehaQ,190159,191920,how do you how do you build trials well
ryJL4f5ehaQ,191920,193599,you do it one-on-one
ryJL4f5ehaQ,193599,195200,and so the question is can you build
ryJL4f5ehaQ,195200,197040,trust at a launch can you do it at a
ryJL4f5ehaQ,197040,200080,dinner and what i found one of the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,200080,202800,things that that works
ryJL4f5ehaQ,202800,205120,is you can't be afraid to be vulnerable
ryJL4f5ehaQ,205120,206480,because when you're vulnerable with
ryJL4f5ehaQ,206480,209680,somebody about 95 of the time they're
ryJL4f5ehaQ,209680,211599,reciprocating kind
ryJL4f5ehaQ,211599,213519,and when both sides are vulnerable that
ryJL4f5ehaQ,213519,215280,forms a connection
ryJL4f5ehaQ,215280,216319,and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,216319,217200,that
ryJL4f5ehaQ,217200,218640,that is a way
ryJL4f5ehaQ,218640,220799,uh that i found all the time or also
ryJL4f5ehaQ,220799,222000,another one is
ryJL4f5ehaQ,222000,224159,tell me your story everybody loves to
ryJL4f5ehaQ,224159,225599,tell their story
ryJL4f5ehaQ,225599,226480,and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,226480,228959,i'm just naturally a curious person so i
ryJL4f5ehaQ,228959,231599,love hearing that never bores me
ryJL4f5ehaQ,231599,232480,so
ryJL4f5ehaQ,232480,234480,it's really the power of one-on-one
ryJL4f5ehaQ,234480,235760,relationships
ryJL4f5ehaQ,235760,237040,we need to go back to this playbook you
ryJL4f5ehaQ,237040,238159,went through it really quick but it
ryJL4f5ehaQ,238159,239519,feels like this playbook has built a
ryJL4f5ehaQ,239519,241680,couple multi-billion dollar businesses
ryJL4f5ehaQ,241680,243439,that that conduct trillions of dollars
ryJL4f5ehaQ,243439,244959,worth of business yeah walk us through
ryJL4f5ehaQ,244959,247360,that playbook again the vision right and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,247360,249519,so for your vision
ryJL4f5ehaQ,249519,251840,uh and our vision at ariba was really
ryJL4f5ehaQ,251840,253599,simple we said we want to build a great
ryJL4f5ehaQ,253599,256160,sustaining company into the 21st century
ryJL4f5ehaQ,256160,257680,the mission
ryJL4f5ehaQ,257680,260799,is all about leadership because the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,260799,262479,object of the game particularly in
ryJL4f5ehaQ,262479,264240,silicon valley is to be the category
ryJL4f5ehaQ,264240,266479,king because when you're the category
ryJL4f5ehaQ,266479,268479,king you get eighty percent of the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,268479,270720,industry resources and eighty percent of
ryJL4f5ehaQ,270720,273040,market cap players two three four five
ryJL4f5ehaQ,273040,276000,six they could fight over the scraps so
ryJL4f5ehaQ,276000,277440,our mission was
ryJL4f5ehaQ,277440,279840,to create a category called business to
ryJL4f5ehaQ,279840,281360,business electronic commerce and to be
ryJL4f5ehaQ,281360,282560,the leader
ryJL4f5ehaQ,282560,285360,and then the the next thing under that
ryJL4f5ehaQ,285360,288400,is your values so right integrity is
ryJL4f5ehaQ,288400,289440,there
ryJL4f5ehaQ,289440,290560,courage
ryJL4f5ehaQ,290560,292080,high ambition
ryJL4f5ehaQ,292080,293759,accountability
ryJL4f5ehaQ,293759,297120,respect the basics and then we had a set
ryJL4f5ehaQ,297120,299680,of team rules that kind of personify
ryJL4f5ehaQ,299680,301919,those values and by the way same team
ryJL4f5ehaQ,301919,303280,rules for all the companies the first
ryJL4f5ehaQ,303280,304240,one
ryJL4f5ehaQ,304240,306240,is direct open and honest communication
ryJL4f5ehaQ,306240,309520,in a word the truth because i had seen
ryJL4f5ehaQ,309520,311840,at general motors when you go through 15
ryJL4f5ehaQ,311840,313520,levels you know i started at the lowest
ryJL4f5ehaQ,313520,314880,of the low production
ryJL4f5ehaQ,314880,316320,to the highest the high where i was a
ryJL4f5ehaQ,316320,317840,staff for the board of directors i could
ryJL4f5ehaQ,317840,320639,see how that message would change right
ryJL4f5ehaQ,320639,324479,the second one is no ideas a bad idea
ryJL4f5ehaQ,324479,326479,and then we added parentheses unless the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,326479,327759,ceos
ryJL4f5ehaQ,327759,329600,so because it's all about making a safe
ryJL4f5ehaQ,329600,330800,environment
ryJL4f5ehaQ,330800,333039,and and and you can make it the safe
ryJL4f5ehaQ,333039,335039,environment when you mock out the ceo
ryJL4f5ehaQ,335039,336560,plus it's fun
ryJL4f5ehaQ,336560,340000,uh the third one is always raise the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,340000,342000,standard in everything we do and our
ryJL4f5ehaQ,342000,344000,people our processes
ryJL4f5ehaQ,344000,346320,and our products and if somebody can't
ryJL4f5ehaQ,346320,348320,keep up with that standard you've got to
ryJL4f5ehaQ,348320,350479,do something about it otherwise you've
ryJL4f5ehaQ,350479,352479,automatically lowered your standard
ryJL4f5ehaQ,352479,354560,then the fourth one is
ryJL4f5ehaQ,354560,357120,we're a team first and functional
ryJL4f5ehaQ,357120,359199,specialist second so
ryJL4f5ehaQ,359199,361600,you developers put your feet into
ryJL4f5ehaQ,361600,363919,customers shoes you sales guys don't
ryJL4f5ehaQ,363919,366240,make commitments we can't keep and then
ryJL4f5ehaQ,366240,367680,the fifth one is the most powerful one
ryJL4f5ehaQ,367680,368720,of all
ryJL4f5ehaQ,368720,370639,and that is hire the best people
ryJL4f5ehaQ,370639,373919,especially if they're better than us
ryJL4f5ehaQ,373919,375919,and your story out to silicon valley is
ryJL4f5ehaQ,375919,377759,an interesting one for you i mean you
ryJL4f5ehaQ,377759,379600,grew up small town ohio you worked in
ryJL4f5ehaQ,379600,381759,your dad's machine shop as a welder went
ryJL4f5ehaQ,381759,383280,to school to become an engineer and i
ryJL4f5ehaQ,383280,384479,think the plan was to go back to the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,384479,386880,machine shop but something
ryJL4f5ehaQ,386880,388560,it was a curveball that happened there
ryJL4f5ehaQ,388560,390960,it starts off in small town ohio
ryJL4f5ehaQ,390960,392800,where my father ran a machine shop and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,392800,395840,my mother was a teacher at age 12 i
ryJL4f5ehaQ,395840,398560,became a welder in my dad's shop in good
ryJL4f5ehaQ,398560,400960,times he employed five workers in tough
ryJL4f5ehaQ,400960,404080,times i was his only employee my father
ryJL4f5ehaQ,404080,406560,encouraged me to get some college
ryJL4f5ehaQ,406560,409120,knowledge and come back as an engineer
ryJL4f5ehaQ,409120,411199,to help them grow the business into a
ryJL4f5ehaQ,411199,414160,big company of 10 employees
ryJL4f5ehaQ,414160,416479,well i didn't become an engineer i never
ryJL4f5ehaQ,416479,418800,went back to work with my dad but he was
ryJL4f5ehaQ,418800,421039,so proud i was a boilermaker and just
ryJL4f5ehaQ,421039,424080,love the fact that was also the name of
ryJL4f5ehaQ,424080,426800,his favorite after work adult beverage
ryJL4f5ehaQ,426800,428639,here's stewie pops
ryJL4f5ehaQ,428639,432160,and the gm came on campus uh my
ryJL4f5ehaQ,432160,434319,sophomore year and gave me a full ride
ryJL4f5ehaQ,434319,437120,they was a gm scholarship so
ryJL4f5ehaQ,437120,439599,that was a real big turning point
ryJL4f5ehaQ,439599,441919,because along with that one and you know
ryJL4f5ehaQ,441919,444000,amazing summer jobs and all that kind of
ryJL4f5ehaQ,444000,447199,stuff um and and then gm sent me off to
ryJL4f5ehaQ,447199,448800,graduate school too
ryJL4f5ehaQ,448800,450880,and then my dad started calling generous
ryJL4f5ehaQ,450880,452960,motors you're being humble summer summer
ryJL4f5ehaQ,452960,455280,student but by age 26 you became the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,455280,458240,youngest vp in their history
ryJL4f5ehaQ,458240,460000,what would they have been seeing in you
ryJL4f5ehaQ,460000,462319,for that to happen um you know i think
ryJL4f5ehaQ,462319,465520,they they saw somebody who wasn't afraid
ryJL4f5ehaQ,465520,467039,to take a risk and and somebody who
ryJL4f5ehaQ,467039,469199,wasn't afraid to own something
ryJL4f5ehaQ,469199,472479,and this summer before um i started
ryJL4f5ehaQ,472479,474400,full-time at general motors between
ryJL4f5ehaQ,474400,475840,years of business school i worked in the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,475840,477599,new york treasurer's office and that
ryJL4f5ehaQ,477599,479199,basically is a staff for the board of
ryJL4f5ehaQ,479199,481440,directors my first job was i was a
ryJL4f5ehaQ,481440,483919,second shift production foreman on the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,483919,485919,chassis line of cadillac but
ryJL4f5ehaQ,485919,489840,um you know what i saw happening uh at
ryJL4f5ehaQ,489840,492160,that time was robotics this was in the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,492160,494479,early 80s it was popping up i had wrote
ryJL4f5ehaQ,494479,496160,you know an equivalent to like a thesis
ryJL4f5ehaQ,496160,497680,at harvard business school on the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,497680,499360,utilization robots and japanese auto
ryJL4f5ehaQ,499360,501599,industry so i went and i pitched the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,501599,503360,board of directors general motors should
ryJL4f5ehaQ,503360,505199,get in the robotics business
ryJL4f5ehaQ,505199,508160,and to buy a surprise they said okay how
ryJL4f5ehaQ,508160,510160,should we do it because they had like
ryJL4f5ehaQ,510160,511919,the most sophisticated robot technology
ryJL4f5ehaQ,511919,513440,i said you know we need to join venture
ryJL4f5ehaQ,513440,515440,because we need a broad product line and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,515440,518159,they and they said with who and i go
ryJL4f5ehaQ,518159,519599,well can i come back to the next board
ryJL4f5ehaQ,519599,520479,meeting
ryJL4f5ehaQ,520479,522800,and uh i'll never forget i came back and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,522800,523760,i said
ryJL4f5ehaQ,523760,525920,we should join venture with a company
ryJL4f5ehaQ,525920,528320,called fujitsu fanuc now understand at
ryJL4f5ehaQ,528320,529519,that time
ryJL4f5ehaQ,529519,530880,all those board of directors they were
ryJL4f5ehaQ,530880,532959,world war ii veterans and they said you
ryJL4f5ehaQ,532959,536240,mean partner with the japanese i go yes
ryJL4f5ehaQ,536240,538000,partner with the japanese
ryJL4f5ehaQ,538000,541200,and uh we built that up uh
ryJL4f5ehaQ,541200,543279,uh to today it's the largest
ryJL4f5ehaQ,543279,544959,manufacturer of industrial robots in the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,544959,548480,world and the average age of that team
ryJL4f5ehaQ,548480,551519,probably was in the early 30s and we uh
ryJL4f5ehaQ,551519,554320,we put ge ibm and westinghouse out of
ryJL4f5ehaQ,554320,555920,business we just became dominant in that
ryJL4f5ehaQ,555920,557600,area you talk about ownership and i
ryJL4f5ehaQ,557600,558560,think that's a word that probably
ryJL4f5ehaQ,558560,560560,connects to a lot of our viewers
ryJL4f5ehaQ,560560,562720,but you know they'd also be thinking how
ryJL4f5ehaQ,562720,564240,do i do that like how did you have the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,564240,566640,confidence the ownership to say you know
ryJL4f5ehaQ,566640,568560,i'm ready to go pitch to the to the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,568560,569920,board yeah
ryJL4f5ehaQ,569920,572800,you know i i think it comes down to um
ryJL4f5ehaQ,572800,575120,i built a high performance team
ryJL4f5ehaQ,575120,577200,as we're getting going right
ryJL4f5ehaQ,577200,580240,and that's the most important job of any
ryJL4f5ehaQ,580240,581360,ceo
ryJL4f5ehaQ,581360,583360,and i really believe that the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,583360,585519,organization the company with the best
ryJL4f5ehaQ,585519,588320,people wins then the key is how to get
ryJL4f5ehaQ,588320,590800,them worked together as a team
ryJL4f5ehaQ,590800,591600,right
ryJL4f5ehaQ,591600,593279,you know the way i believe in that is
ryJL4f5ehaQ,593279,595680,you've got to have a north star
ryJL4f5ehaQ,595680,597760,a noble cause
ryJL4f5ehaQ,597760,600560,you also need an enemy
ryJL4f5ehaQ,600560,602399,because you know that stops the water
ryJL4f5ehaQ,602399,604320,cooler talk nothing gets the blood stir
ryJL4f5ehaQ,604320,605279,you know the united states state
ryJL4f5ehaQ,605279,607360,department we call it adversary but in
ryJL4f5ehaQ,607360,609200,business we call it an enemy and then
ryJL4f5ehaQ,609200,610959,the third thing you need is you need a
ryJL4f5ehaQ,610959,611839,plan
ryJL4f5ehaQ,611839,614399,and with all these companies
ryJL4f5ehaQ,614399,616800,that have the good fortune to build and
ryJL4f5ehaQ,616800,618640,these different organizations around we
ryJL4f5ehaQ,618640,620880,would always have a playbook and that's
ryJL4f5ehaQ,620880,623200,basically the vision the mission the
ryJL4f5ehaQ,623200,625680,values the team rules long-term goals
ryJL4f5ehaQ,625680,629200,strategy all boiled down to execution so
ryJL4f5ehaQ,629200,630959,it really was a way to maintain
ryJL4f5ehaQ,630959,633519,alignment and a
ryJL4f5ehaQ,633519,635200,a tremendous tool when it comes to
ryJL4f5ehaQ,635200,636800,scaling
ryJL4f5ehaQ,636800,638480,whether they can go to the kroc
