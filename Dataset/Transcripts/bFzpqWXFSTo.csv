bFzpqWXFSTo,240,5839,in this video you're going to see one of  central asia's most bizarre foods look  transformation
bFzpqWXFSTo,5839,13040,these are called milk lungs soon you're  going to see how they're made and how  they taste but first let's back up
bFzpqWXFSTo,13040,19680,to find these dairy-filled lungs i had  to come to central asia a collection of  countries from kazakhstan to afghanistan
bFzpqWXFSTo,19680,25119,right in the heart of central asia  you'll find uzbekistan which is where  i'm taking you today
bFzpqWXFSTo,25119,31920,dude where are you  i'm on a mission to show you some of the  most creative oh my god twisted
bFzpqWXFSTo,31920,38000,mouth-watering creations few people have  seen before holy cow it all starts
bFzpqWXFSTo,38000,43520,here they have something called what do  you call it in your language it's such a  unique thing that we don't have name so
bFzpqWXFSTo,43520,50640,description is the name what is it  milk  inside  of the line i don't need to explain more
bFzpqWXFSTo,50640,56719,we're going to go in let's go let's go  tandoor kabob started just four years
bFzpqWXFSTo,56719,63280,ago their menu includes the greatest  hits from around fergana valley  this is chef bahama john the only one
bFzpqWXFSTo,63280,70079,trusted to make this dish oddly enough  this non-bread dish starts with a dough
bFzpqWXFSTo,70479,75840,a blend of flour water and salt knead it  up and let it rest in a basin he adds
bFzpqWXFSTo,75840,81680,hot cow milk  sliced onions  and that big ball of dough the dough is
bFzpqWXFSTo,81680,87920,constantly and methodically massaged and  mixed in the basin until it becomes weak  and stringy
bFzpqWXFSTo,87920,95119,after some serious dough squeezing he  removes the glob along with the onions  all that remains is doughy oniony milk
bFzpqWXFSTo,95119,101439,the milk isn't just any milk he mixed  the dough in with the milk and then  through the dough away
bFzpqWXFSTo,101439,108720,the dough makes the milk more thicker  and it stays in the lung if you put just  milk it will go out like a water so it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,108720,114000,changing the physical properties of it  yeah i knew it can you feed it to like a  cow or something they feed it together
bFzpqWXFSTo,114000,120240,he said cow's gonna eat it and then they  make more milk yes  those lungs are empty now everyone who's
bFzpqWXFSTo,120240,127360,watching do a big exhale  that's what your lungs look like inside  and later they're gonna get full of
bFzpqWXFSTo,127360,132480,stuff you're gonna see what kind of  stuff right over here so he grabs along  and he has a carrot here he's looking
bFzpqWXFSTo,132480,139040,for the right fit the carrot is like the  cork on a wine bottle if it squeezes out  too easily he doesn't like it now we're
bFzpqWXFSTo,139040,144560,gonna finally see the transformation  that takes place as he puts it in  this is like two liters of milk going
bFzpqWXFSTo,144560,150959,inside of here look transformation how  would you describe that alveolus inside  of the lung they're being filled and
bFzpqWXFSTo,150959,156959,they used to be pink but now they're all  white  i'm gonna give it a poke is it hard very
bFzpqWXFSTo,156959,163360,firm  he puts in pepper and then he hits it  with some oil of course we're in  uzbekistan this is the land of the
bFzpqWXFSTo,163360,170800,world's richest heaviest food he has to  just dump two cups of oil in there and  then slowly he got it's important to
bFzpqWXFSTo,170800,176239,kind of massage it a bit it's full he  corks it with the carrot and then the  final step he's going to tie it off with
bFzpqWXFSTo,176239,183040,a string here we have two healthy line  looks like this it looks very healthy  completely full of seasoned onion milk
bFzpqWXFSTo,183040,188720,next to the field and court lungs are  boiled in water for two hours before  moving on to the next step we're going
bFzpqWXFSTo,188720,194480,to come back to this soon but in the  meantime i want to show you a style of  cooking that goes way back right here
bFzpqWXFSTo,194480,200800,the action is happening here we are i'm  about to burn my leg hairs off through  my jeans somehow these are tandoor ovens
bFzpqWXFSTo,200800,206400,using cottonwood these reach up to  hundreds of degrees it's so big you  could fit like six human bodies in here
bFzpqWXFSTo,206400,212480,and they're used to cook some of the  world's most succulent meats including  fat tail sheep sausage do you know you
bFzpqWXFSTo,212480,218080,have sheep unlike any other sheep in the  world  yeah yeah i know he knows he said i know  and then he grabs the butt instinct you
bFzpqWXFSTo,218080,224959,know when you see it you grab it you  don't see this on just any sheep a lot  of sheep got bony little butts there's  nothing there like
bFzpqWXFSTo,224959,232000,this is a fat tailed sheep a genetically  mutated species whose entire tail has  become one swang kardashian-like
bFzpqWXFSTo,232000,237200,posterior it doesn't even have a purpose  it's just hanging there but that's where  all the flavor is where is the most
bFzpqWXFSTo,237200,243680,flavor in this shape  some people like the ribs some people  like neck the unique thing about the
bFzpqWXFSTo,243680,250000,ship is it's flavorful all the way all  right i  thought he was gonna say the butt i  disagree i think all the flavor is in
bFzpqWXFSTo,250000,255040,the butt i agree with you man thank you  he's saying that he's gonna take the fat  ass out of it look at this whole thing
bFzpqWXFSTo,255040,262240,it's just a big chunk of fat  [Music]  wow boom sheep booty aside from copious
bFzpqWXFSTo,262240,268560,amounts of butt fat the sausage gets  plenty of protein too now he's gonna  butcher it with the eggs
bFzpqWXFSTo,268560,274390,with 15 years of experience chef scihiro  deep precisely portions out each pile
bFzpqWXFSTo,274390,281360,[Music]  the final result 100 pounds of meat and  fat ready for some seasoning
bFzpqWXFSTo,281360,289280,salt pepper cumin all mixed up then  joined by uzbek lemon including the  lemon zest add hot water mix once more
bFzpqWXFSTo,289280,294800,and it's ready for the next step in the  meantime those milk gloves have been  boiling for about an hour slowly turning
bFzpqWXFSTo,294800,300560,them solid oh it's like a water balloon  filled with hot water the inside's  getting a little bit firmer a little bit
bFzpqWXFSTo,300560,306720,harder i think it's on its way to  becoming solid i can't wait to try this  out even from here to the plate what's  that gonna look like are they gonna just
bFzpqWXFSTo,306720,312000,slice it like a loaf of bread now back  to the sausage  stuff the seasoned meat into sheep
bFzpqWXFSTo,312000,318000,intestine  and tie it closed with a string  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,318000,325759,he portions each sausage so it's plump  and girthy but still short enough to fit  in the pan i've seen sausages hung i've
bFzpqWXFSTo,325759,331360,seen them smoke i've seen them cooked on  a grill but here they're filling up a  huge rack full of big pans of thick
bFzpqWXFSTo,331360,338400,sausage  and that's it it doesn't actually touch  the bottom he puts the hazan upside down
bFzpqWXFSTo,338400,344720,and then now this has to be sealed  soon in about an hour we're going to  take it out and test this juicy sausage
bFzpqWXFSTo,344720,349840,and see how it tastes while we wait i do  believe we've got some milk lungs that  have finished cooking as you can see
bFzpqWXFSTo,349840,355280,they've kind of shrunk down they've  shriveled up a little bit like uh it's a  good example of something that shrivels
bFzpqWXFSTo,355280,362160,oh  it is all one consistency it's like  jellowy almost gelatin as you might say
bFzpqWXFSTo,362160,367919,take a look here on the outside that's  lung on the inside right here that's  kind of hard and cooked milk right here
bFzpqWXFSTo,367919,372560,he's put on a seasoning a mixture of  chili and salt
bFzpqWXFSTo,376800,382000,my bro  i feel overwhelmed what did i just eat  well i need some time to digest that
bFzpqWXFSTo,382000,387759,mostly mentally actually what i really  need is the crew so i need to share this  experience with him before we could sit  down to eat we need to bring some
bFzpqWXFSTo,387759,393120,sausages to this party  wow  it's so mutton look at all the steam you
bFzpqWXFSTo,393120,399039,guys can't see anything can you  big review  wow
bFzpqWXFSTo,399840,405759,the sausage is completely cooked through  boiling in its own juices right now oh  my god look at it if you like living on
bFzpqWXFSTo,405759,411919,the edge try using four hanger chips and  it won't break he said to lift up more  than 100 pounds of sizzling meat stop
bFzpqWXFSTo,411919,419440,you stop okay he's going to pour off  some of the liquid right now okay  lift lift lift it okay we got it over
bFzpqWXFSTo,419440,426000,we put it down i got it  the meat it's amazing how much it's  cooked down full of that in water and
bFzpqWXFSTo,426000,431520,even the liquid itself looks pretty  tasty yeah it's going in it was just a  sausage now it's a full course like it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,431520,437759,soup and the main course allow me to  officially introduce the cruz the  unofficial ambassador of uzbekistan
bFzpqWXFSTo,437759,444319,tourism once it became easier for  outsiders to travel to this country the  crews bent over backwards to introduce
bFzpqWXFSTo,444319,450720,content creators and their audiences to  the rich food secrets of central asian
bFzpqWXFSTo,450720,457039,it's still very hot but i think we can  break off a piece  boom that's yours oh thank you enjoy it  oh dude it's so hot quite manageable
bFzpqWXFSTo,457039,462960,speak for yourself  [Applause]  so good that's so delicious the cumin
bFzpqWXFSTo,462960,468960,gives it a beautiful depth of flavor  yeah seasoning is amazing the meat is  soft juicy  and it's just like eating little pieces
bFzpqWXFSTo,468960,475840,of steak it's a really unique type of  sausage a lot of sausages you know  they're ground up they're really fine i  mean a hot dog it's just
bFzpqWXFSTo,475840,480879,one sorry are you comparing this to hot  dogs the other thing is that if you were  making sausage with like beef almost
bFzpqWXFSTo,480879,486560,always they would add some pork yeah for  the fat content but here it's got that  doomba ratio of the meat and fat is just
bFzpqWXFSTo,486560,493759,perfect  oh it's amazing man awesome  our final strangely satisfying feast
bFzpqWXFSTo,493759,499520,include sausage and milk looks plus  tandoor kabob bread and uzbek lemon let
bFzpqWXFSTo,499520,505599,me explain i thought some people might  be confused earlier when i'm talking  about the sausages being made and i'm  saying in voiceover that they're putting
bFzpqWXFSTo,505599,511360,lemon on there and people watching are  like um that is an orange sonny forgot  what oranges are that's a lemon yes so
bFzpqWXFSTo,511360,517680,we had a local biologist guy who came up  with a new species of a lemon he crossed  the tangerine with a lemon oh so it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,517680,523460,like a trans fruit yeah right yeah all  right i'm open to that
bFzpqWXFSTo,523460,528640,[Music]  it's not an orange  super citrusy that is exactly a cross
bFzpqWXFSTo,528640,534320,between an orange and a lemon it's a  really good palette cleanser perfect  orange lemon that's the first for me
bFzpqWXFSTo,534320,539839,we've tried a lot of this stuff so far  but he especially has not tried this and  i need to try it again to really wrap my
bFzpqWXFSTo,539839,545200,mind around it wait what are you feeling  right now i don't know man i have really  mixed feelings i don't like gooey stuff
bFzpqWXFSTo,545200,552080,look how jelly it  let's do it let's do it last we must  build up to that but first this tandoor
bFzpqWXFSTo,552080,559120,lamb is one of their signature items the  lamb meat is marinated overnight using a  spice blend of cumin nutmeg pepper
bFzpqWXFSTo,559120,566640,paprika and more then it spends three  hours in the fiery tan door until it's  fully cooked through
bFzpqWXFSTo,567440,572800,i saw a similar preparation last time i  was here in uzbekistan but they were  using like a mud tan door using this
bFzpqWXFSTo,572800,579600,lattice structure to hold all the meat  this is not so dissimilar except for  it's in that big underground tendon
bFzpqWXFSTo,579600,585360,very tender the flavors are a bit mild  it's just lightly seasoned i like that  jerky part looks like a beef jerky oh
bFzpqWXFSTo,585360,590640,yeah there's like some crunchy part oh  yes this kind of crust that's developed  here that is where a lot of the flavors
bFzpqWXFSTo,590640,597200,are  that is good good  it's almost like creamy and buttery  people think it's fatty and it's not a
bFzpqWXFSTo,597200,603040,good way like oh it's fatty but it's not  it's fat but like in a good way yeah  like me
bFzpqWXFSTo,603040,610240,oh bread this is a local flatbread and  at this restaurant they make their own  fresh daily made from wheat flour butter
bFzpqWXFSTo,610240,616320,and milk but the best part is the baking  done inside a hot clay oven built  specifically for this type of bread this
bFzpqWXFSTo,616320,622800,bread is awesome so soft like a freshly  baked pizza crust yeah  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,622800,628079,ma'am central asia the food is so hard  to pin down because for me at least in  the us we don't have enough references
bFzpqWXFSTo,628079,634240,for it so we have like east asian  restaurants indian restaurant we have  middle eastern food and then this is  something converging between all of
bFzpqWXFSTo,634240,639360,those because of the silk road we got a  little bit of that little bit of that  the melting pot different cultures
bFzpqWXFSTo,639360,645120,different cuisines merch into new ones  speaking of melting pot this just came  out of the melting pot a second ago yeah
bFzpqWXFSTo,645120,650480,lungs the feeling gosh oh it feels  exactly like tofu is it bug you it is
bFzpqWXFSTo,650480,656079,bugging me oh my god okay you ready yeah  don't hide your expression we want to
bFzpqWXFSTo,656079,663360,see your eyes are the window to your  soul and also your mouth is a little bit  too man but you know what  i love it man you love it so good good
bFzpqWXFSTo,663360,668800,yeah  so so it needs bread i've yet to  describe it  for you what's it like at least for me
bFzpqWXFSTo,668800,674160,it doesn't look that appealing isn't  that the best part about this show it is  it's like breaking your preconceived
bFzpqWXFSTo,674160,680240,notions about about my own culture like  you know yes and you are from here it's  awesome that you get to see this even
bFzpqWXFSTo,680240,685519,now looking at it thinking oh this is  not going to be good and you're kind of  into it very salty but very rich right
bFzpqWXFSTo,685519,691120,extremely rich it's really hard to  describe i can't tell any difference  between what is milk and what is lung
bFzpqWXFSTo,691120,697519,it's all just become one solid congealed  consistency  so fascinating it's incredibly inventive
bFzpqWXFSTo,697519,704399,whoever thought of this wow nice work  i've tried boiled lung i know how it  tastes like and it's not most flavorful
bFzpqWXFSTo,704399,710720,meat because of the texture or  aftertaste but the milk washed down all  the negative aspects and brought that
bFzpqWXFSTo,710720,717839,interesting taste to it it's the perfect  partnership kind of like meme and and  like if i could clone myself
bFzpqWXFSTo,718079,724639,next up we'll be tasting a rarely  appreciated body part that people here  go crazy for the neck of a sheep first
bFzpqWXFSTo,724639,729839,of all what kind of steroids was a sheep  on he was doing a lot of bench press i  mean take a look this isn't even the
bFzpqWXFSTo,729839,736480,skin that is the fat under the skin you  can see layers of protein and fat and  then there's bones all of that gets
bFzpqWXFSTo,736480,741680,semi-stewed semi-cooked super super  tender  is this something that you can find all
bFzpqWXFSTo,741680,747279,over the country it's available  throughout the country but especially  anderjohn people really like cheapening
bFzpqWXFSTo,747279,753600,perfect i'm going to put this down  we've got our sheet neck now let's head  to the restaurant to cook it up
bFzpqWXFSTo,753600,759760,toontok restaurant has been here  slanging out next and other regional  foods for over 25 years now usually a
bFzpqWXFSTo,759760,765200,lot of people they go to a restaurant  they completely skip this stuff they  just order from the menu  medium rare that's it boring instead
bFzpqWXFSTo,765200,770399,what we get to see is how this neck  really works  chef mohammed is here to demonstrate how
bFzpqWXFSTo,770399,776480,the neck goes from a hulking mass to an  edible delight almost like he's cutting  into little neck stakes but he can't get
bFzpqWXFSTo,776480,782000,all the way through because of the neck  bone the spine is still there this man  has an axe but it's not going to be easy
bFzpqWXFSTo,782000,786839,i wore the wrong colored clothes today  or pretty
bFzpqWXFSTo,793680,800959,he's actually dicing the neck or slicing  it this way making little neck stakes  almost like it's a freaking tuna or
bFzpqWXFSTo,800959,806240,something  quick question since we're here  uzbekistan the land of many things the
bFzpqWXFSTo,806240,812880,land of plov the land of samsara  also land of thick eyebrows is that true  look at this guy his magnificent

bFzpqWXFSTo,818240,824560,special chef made blend containing 11  different spices including significant  traces of cumin
bFzpqWXFSTo,824560,831040,first a layer of meat then a layer of  salt and seasonings  when the pot is piled high it braises
bFzpqWXFSTo,831040,835360,lowly and slowly for five hours
bFzpqWXFSTo,836240,842560,i know there's some people watching they  heard sheep neck and they thought that's  a little bit weird i knew because i've  been to uzbekistan i trusted that it was
bFzpqWXFSTo,842560,847760,probably going to be cooked in some kind  of way like this slow cooked lots of  time for the fat to break down become
bFzpqWXFSTo,847760,853839,just a freaking juice i mean we could  import this into the usa and solve our  oil problem
bFzpqWXFSTo,853839,860160,what is a good pizza i think wait hold  on i found something oh  i found a tumor  they gave us some bonus parts it looks
bFzpqWXFSTo,860160,866079,like that looks like a kidney huh it is  a kid you want to have a kidney yeah  [Music]  it's like kind of livery and dry harm

bFzpqWXFSTo,878959,885279,a knife you just scrape it off and oh my  god you know what i'm gonna do dip it  give it a dip in the oil
bFzpqWXFSTo,885279,890639,that was awesome and the seasoning it's  just perfect beautifully stewed soft  juicy fatty it's even better when you

bFzpqWXFSTo,973759,981040,i was super excited about this until i  realized we are in a muslim majority  country and most people here don't drink
bFzpqWXFSTo,981040,986800,instead of jaeger bombs and dancers when  uzbek men gather it's all about stories  and food the worst thing that goes on

bFzpqWXFSTo,1051280,1056799,fried tasting a bit heavy and then just  juicy and fatty in the middle especially  the smaller the pieces the crunchier it
bFzpqWXFSTo,1056799,1062030,is it's a little bit like pork rinds i  think technically i'm not supposed to  say that in this country hey bet cruz am  i allowed to say that

bFzpqWXFSTo,1073919,1080240,portion of broth salt cumin then add  some heat with a few chilies
bFzpqWXFSTo,1080240,1085520,now the rice he distributes it evenly  then adds hot water and lets it boil
bFzpqWXFSTo,1085520,1091200,i have to ask more about this  gentleman's club theme is there any food  that is exclusively for men or can women
bFzpqWXFSTo,1091200,1096240,eat everything that many remove the lid  to add more seasoning then let it steam  for 40 minutes there is no any
bFzpqWXFSTo,1096240,1101919,restrictions but usually men tend to  like something really heavy a lot of oil
bFzpqWXFSTo,1101919,1108400,a lot of meat and stuff and women tend  to look after themselves and like be  more salad something light and we just
bFzpqWXFSTo,1108400,1114320,don't care man yeah when the rice is  perfectly cooked remove the lid  revealing a heavy pile of this country's
bFzpqWXFSTo,1114320,1119760,favorite food to feast on  you know it's perfect when the rice is
bFzpqWXFSTo,1119760,1127039,glistening and shiny  so  gentlemen's club

bFzpqWXFSTo,1159679,1165760,texture right it's a little tougher a  little bit chewier rice this is such a  heavy food it's oily greasy but in a
bFzpqWXFSTo,1165760,1172000,good way i get the heavy food because  it's kind of cold here and people here  seem to work hard so this kind of just  keeps you going for the whole day the

bFzpqWXFSTo,1417120,1422159,whip you like that yeah i don't know if  i'm a grape please fan a shower it's  thick it's like a coarse leaf and then
bFzpqWXFSTo,1422159,1429279,the meat it doesn't taste like a ton of  meat but it's like filled with some kind  of juice like a leaf and meat juice i  find this to be fine
bFzpqWXFSTo,1429279,1434480,i have to say that sometimes because  what if i'm here saying oh every food is  amazing how trustworthy do i see men not
bFzpqWXFSTo,1434480,1439520,very are you in love with them  okay sorry right now we're working our  way up to this and we're gonna figure
bFzpqWXFSTo,1439520,1445360,out what is inside of there and how it  tastes but first  this
bFzpqWXFSTo,1445360,1451120,it looks a little bit like a glazed  donut but then that's not sugar these  are balls of minced mutton and rice
bFzpqWXFSTo,1451120,1456240,wrapped inside a layer of call fat i'm  gonna grab this one and i'm gonna grab  this one without any coffee i'm fine i
bFzpqWXFSTo,1456240,1462400,think come on dude you  can put that back  doesn't feel too gamey let's try it out

bFzpqWXFSTo,1467919,1474400,have a barometer now the audience  believes me because that's just okay  well this is really good i like it  sometimes call fat can be a bit intense
bFzpqWXFSTo,1474400,1480240,yeah and gaming not here there's no  really strong sheepy muttony taste to it  you can taste some cumin some salt a
bFzpqWXFSTo,1480240,1486720,little bit of heat it's beautifully  minced inside and then just this really  fatty layer on the outside just makes it  more kind of rich and fatty and it's fun
bFzpqWXFSTo,1486720,1492000,to bite through i think that's like a  hundred calories at least bro no it's  got to be like 400. there's got to be so
bFzpqWXFSTo,1492000,1498480,many spontaneous tea action tea is the  main drink here in uzbekistan in fact  uzbekistan has one of the highest levels
bFzpqWXFSTo,1498480,1504320,of tea consumption per capita even more  than japan it's like a way to cleanse  yourself after just a bit of a rough
bFzpqWXFSTo,1504320,1510159,experience  final dish right here what do you call  this we call it bastur that's
bFzpqWXFSTo,1510159,1516080,yes sir the name bastorma is often  associated with air-dried cured beef in  middle eastern and mediterranean
bFzpqWXFSTo,1516080,1522480,countries while this is definitely not  cured beef this is infamous sheep but  they shave the butt they wrap the meat
bFzpqWXFSTo,1522480,1529120,with this pasture and cooked it gives a  really nice taste man the closer you  look you see they missed a few spots
bFzpqWXFSTo,1529120,1534159,like me when i shave in the morning this  is nuts  it smells good a lot of these are very
bFzpqWXFSTo,1534159,1541120,strong like cumin tasting they're  smelling i'm going to cut a healthy  slice  yeah look at this amazing cross section
bFzpqWXFSTo,1541120,1546130,all this heavy fatty huge meat chunks  hit it with some chili salt put it in  half like a taco
bFzpqWXFSTo,1546130,1551760,[Music]  dude this is remarkably good
bFzpqWXFSTo,1551760,1557679,it leaves such a rich aftertaste it's so  much protein and so much just rich  lively fats look at that it does not
bFzpqWXFSTo,1557679,1563840,look appetizing at all you cannot judge  a sausage by its casing everything we  had looked like oh what is that weird
bFzpqWXFSTo,1563840,1570000,strange congealed mass of meat it's like  why is my meat in a perfect cube with  right angles but in the end everything's
bFzpqWXFSTo,1570000,1575200,quite delicious this end up being my  favorite thing today of all the sausages  i should say this sausage party is not
bFzpqWXFSTo,1575200,1580240,ending no oh it works because sausage  and also  you know
bFzpqWXFSTo,1580240,1586559,after strange meats there's nothing i  crave more than strange sweets now this  next food is not exclusively consumed by
bFzpqWXFSTo,1586559,1592400,men in fact it's loved by all why  wouldn't you love it sweet it's funny  looking but to make it you'll need a few
bFzpqWXFSTo,1592400,1599440,dudes with a strong grip and a fair bit  of upper body strength  let's start from the beginning
bFzpqWXFSTo,1599440,1605520,we're here today for a candy called  poshmark that starts with sugar boiled  down into a syrup
bFzpqWXFSTo,1605520,1611440,in the meantime sift wheat flour and  pounded walnuts into a large bowl and  mix them up
bFzpqWXFSTo,1611440,1618559,warm the flour mixture on the stove and  spread it out over the table  we're gonna need that soon
bFzpqWXFSTo,1618559,1624790,as the syrup bubbles roston prepares his  cooling bowl by adding oil then the hot  syrup
bFzpqWXFSTo,1624790,1631200,[Applause]  cooling bowl is placed in water and  spawned until the candy reaches a  temperature that won't give you third
bFzpqWXFSTo,1631200,1637679,degree burns  finally this is where the magic happens
bFzpqWXFSTo,1637679,1644240,a quick pulling process that'll soon  make this thick candy look  unrecognizable  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,1644240,1649760,and i think i've seen something similar  in other places but never like this so  it starts with one strand they loop it
bFzpqWXFSTo,1649760,1655220,then they stretch it more then they loop  it then they stretch it more eventually  this is going to become like angel hair
bFzpqWXFSTo,1655220,1661039,[Music]  rooster is a third generation candy  maker and he's kindly invited us to his
bFzpqWXFSTo,1661039,1667200,90 year old factory to witness the  making of this national suite so now it  is so thin it is literally like hair if
bFzpqWXFSTo,1667200,1674159,i was gonna have hair in my food i  wanted to be this hair how do they know  when they're done  they know it when it becomes less
bFzpqWXFSTo,1674159,1681520,stretchy so when they stop stretching  then they're like okay time to stop  we're getting close to that point  they're pulling hard but really again
bFzpqWXFSTo,1681520,1687679,[Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  so now we're ready for the next step now
bFzpqWXFSTo,1687679,1693679,he's gonna cut it  dude  look at these fine fine strands of
bFzpqWXFSTo,1693679,1699679,sugary sweetness covered in wheat flour  but also walnut flour that is awesome is  this what your hair looks like in the
bFzpqWXFSTo,1699679,1704799,morning mine yeah not mine i don't have  enough it gets more and more hard and  brittle the longer it hangs out because
bFzpqWXFSTo,1704799,1711039,it's cooling down let's try it out  it's crunchy it is but slowly it turns
bFzpqWXFSTo,1711039,1716880,into gummy huh yeah gummy it melts in  your mouth a bit it's super sweet i mean  it's made out of pure sugar essentially
bFzpqWXFSTo,1716880,1723679,syrup and then there's a hint of that  walnut in there and they're putting more  walnuts look how he's doing man with an  experienced hand rustom divides the
bFzpqWXFSTo,1723679,1729200,strands into serving sizes stuffing them  with more walnut powder than rolling  them up during their peak season they
bFzpqWXFSTo,1729200,1735120,sell up to 30 000 rolls a month  the flour is too much i breathed it in
bFzpqWXFSTo,1735120,1740960,oh man you appreciate it so much more  when your life is flashing before your  eyes and you think this is going to be  the end this is the last thing i'm ever
bFzpqWXFSTo,1740960,1746000,going to eat that's a good thing bro it  tastes some more super sweet but then  now there's just more texture and more
bFzpqWXFSTo,1746000,1751160,walnut nuttiness inside really elevated  level of enjoyment sir thank you can we  do some elbows you blow
bFzpqWXFSTo,1751160,1756399,[Music]  for an epic ending to this video we're
bFzpqWXFSTo,1756399,1765200,going to need an epic kitchen it is  microscopic this here is a sparrow sorry  not a sparrow i mean 100 sparrows all on
bFzpqWXFSTo,1765200,1770799,one plate if little birds won't fill you  up you can always add a couple local  ducks to the order this is well duck
bFzpqWXFSTo,1770799,1777600,yeah  the only way do you catch it you shoot  it somebody shot this they remove the  bug shots and they clean it right away i
bFzpqWXFSTo,1777600,1782880,don't see any entry or exit wounds i  think it's a sniper shot precise not a
bFzpqWXFSTo,1782880,1789120,bug shot because otherwise if you shoot  it it will explode bro  look how small it is yeah we don't shoot
bFzpqWXFSTo,1789120,1794960,it with a tank so i don't need to worry  about biting down my back no that's the  main point force cam towards your  insurance is going to cover it so don't
bFzpqWXFSTo,1794960,1800159,worry about it my life insurance not my  health insurance  boil the ducks for one hour with salt
bFzpqWXFSTo,1800159,1805840,then take them out deep frying until  they're crispy  the meat inside is super dark meat is a
bFzpqWXFSTo,1805840,1812250,little bit reddish it's been boiled it's  been fried usually things here are like  fried then boiled or steamed other way  around this time yeah
bFzpqWXFSTo,1812250,1819840,[Music]  that's about what i expected super rich  dark gaming that is an aftertaste
bFzpqWXFSTo,1819840,1825200,right well i don't know we've had  nothing but mutton so far and mutton can  be incredibly gamey but this to me not
bFzpqWXFSTo,1825200,1830559,gaming but very dark whether it's just  more that is darker it's more soft it's  like that times five i like it it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,1830559,1837760,interesting after us trying lamb all the  time just change the meat i think it's a  good substitution last up sparrows
bFzpqWXFSTo,1837760,1844000,this is the tiniest bird i've ever seen  in my life how are people catching these  they set up a trap when enough birds
bFzpqWXFSTo,1844000,1850240,come in they just pulled it up and they  catch it alive it's cost like 50 cents  per piece  you can't call them a piece it's a
bFzpqWXFSTo,1850240,1856159,creature  the tedious preparation of 100 sparrows  starts with dumba fat cubed and seasoned
bFzpqWXFSTo,1856159,1862720,with salt then stuffed inside the  sparrow is kinda lean therefore you have  to compensate that with a cheap fat
bFzpqWXFSTo,1862720,1869200,creates a really good flavor combination  after stuffing they take their final  flight to the hot oil deep frying until
bFzpqWXFSTo,1869200,1875679,they're crispy do you ever worry that  uzbekistan will run out of sparrows  we have more than enough all right  that's a really oh good bandana don't
bFzpqWXFSTo,1875679,1881039,even do that this is an already dainty  delicate bird so once they're cleaned  and feathered there's almost nothing
bFzpqWXFSTo,1881039,1890440,left you may be wondering so where's the  meat but when it comes to these guys you  have to eat them whole bones and all
bFzpqWXFSTo,1893120,1899440,i don't know interesting crunchy  definitely taste chicken but it's so  dark ultra dark meat a little bit like
bFzpqWXFSTo,1899440,1905279,the duck because i think they have like  organs remaining like liver and other oh  yeah they didn't do like a micro surgery
bFzpqWXFSTo,1905279,1910720,to take out the intestines or stomach  we're eating whatever this bird was  eating most likely i've eaten sparrows
bFzpqWXFSTo,1910720,1915840,before or pigeons and it's like okay  i've had like a family of pigeons and  then i've had an extended family this is
bFzpqWXFSTo,1915840,1921600,like a whole family tree everyone with  the last name smith in the sparrow  community has been wiped out right here
bFzpqWXFSTo,1921600,1926960,and i feel bad about that except for  they look pretty good too  have you ever tasted like zumba do
bFzpqWXFSTo,1926960,1932159,anything for you i forgot about the  dumbo so there's been a dune bug i do  not taste the doombop i think the taste
bFzpqWXFSTo,1932159,1938320,of the sparrow just overtook it careful  the bone jab you on the gums that's what  i was trying to make extra chewing
bFzpqWXFSTo,1938320,1943519,process but the bones themselves it's  nice it's crunchy i just imagine like my  dad was on food stamps and i was a kid
bFzpqWXFSTo,1943519,1948880,my dad couldn't have gotten food stamps  our turkey would have been like this on  thanksgiving it was just
bFzpqWXFSTo,1948880,1955200,a tiny little mashed potatoes tiny  little stuffing on the side like sorry  it was a bad 2011. i don't know why in
bFzpqWXFSTo,1955200,1960680,this story i'm 26.  [Music]  [Applause]
bFzpqWXFSTo,1960680,1967519,[Music]  next i'm going to show you uzbekistan's
bFzpqWXFSTo,1967519,1974320,mutant sheep species it's like a shape  from avatar this is a fat-tailed sheep
bFzpqWXFSTo,1974320,1981600,this is the kim kardashian sheep instead  of a tail like this their chunky  beehives consist of nearly 100 fat do
bFzpqWXFSTo,1981600,1987519,you want a slap and that fat is the  foundation for much of uzbek cuisine  it's been fried the oils get released
bFzpqWXFSTo,1987519,1992799,and then he's fried all the other organs  in there i mean just look at it oh yes
bFzpqWXFSTo,1992799,1999519,what is going on  i'm on a mission to show you the asian  cuisine you never knew existed right
bFzpqWXFSTo,1999519,2004640,behind me one of the most unusual  preparations i've ever seen starting at  the market
bFzpqWXFSTo,2004640,2010880,it does smell like something you'd get  in korea then ending with a fat teal  sheep cooked up eight different ways is  this going to give me superpowers
bFzpqWXFSTo,2010880,2016320,including raw sheep  oh gushy
bFzpqWXFSTo,2016799,2024799,it all starts here  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,2024799,2030559,welcome to dejan bowseri the largest  bazaar in for ghana  every time i've come to a market in
bFzpqWXFSTo,2030559,2036960,uzbekistan it is picture perfect  everything is clean organized bright  colorful i feel like i'm in a central
bFzpqWXFSTo,2036960,2043440,asian fairy tale here look a whole wagon  full of actual bread yes sir fresh from  nolan amazing yeah so follow us as we
bFzpqWXFSTo,2043440,2050158,take a look around the market and  hopefully we'll find some ready-to-eat  food as well let's go  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,2050158,2055919,right here we have the bread section  they're offloading tons of bread in fact  we have a whole wagon full right here
bFzpqWXFSTo,2055919,2062158,why is all the bread flat if you're  wondering if uzbekistan is a rice or a  bread country because the earth is flat
bFzpqWXFSTo,2062158,2067520,it's both  that's the best answer ever i thought  the earth was like a loaf of bread no no
bFzpqWXFSTo,2067520,2073040,it's more like a flavor it's a flatbread  bro it has a little curvature but it is  a flip for the bakers here bread isn't
bFzpqWXFSTo,2073040,2079200,just a commodity it's a canvas so that  red is not only flat but it's extremely  ornate and beautifully decorated some
bFzpqWXFSTo,2079200,2084878,use it to make art they have sesame  seeds around the perimeter there's  walnuts there's little raisins inside
bFzpqWXFSTo,2084878,2091118,and others use it to promote their  business here there's some bread that  has some words etched into it what does  this say that's a business card brother
bFzpqWXFSTo,2091118,2097040,the name of a guy and his phone number  so we are eating and you're like man i  like this bird so much i wonder if i can
bFzpqWXFSTo,2097040,2102560,get more oh wait there is a phone number  i can call them up wait hold on can we  pretend we're japanese businessmen yeah
bFzpqWXFSTo,2102560,2108560,yeah  you had to put it in your wallet
bFzpqWXFSTo,2112720,2118320,right here this is the biggest bread i  can find so far let's try it out
bFzpqWXFSTo,2118320,2123760,man everything will grow it's like a  thick bagel on the outside and then thin  and a little bit more chewy on the
bFzpqWXFSTo,2123760,2129680,inside i love breadier it's so thick and  usually you're not just gonna eat a  bunch of bread by itself it's meant to  cut some of maybe the heavier food
bFzpqWXFSTo,2129680,2135839,you're eating here love it we need to  maybe get a shopping bag for this and  keep moving
bFzpqWXFSTo,2136000,2142079,the silk road influence here can be  traced to uzbekistan's neighbors to the  east and west but even a country as far
bFzpqWXFSTo,2142079,2148640,away as korea has also made its mark the  woman here she looks korean man she is  korean
bFzpqWXFSTo,2148960,2154800,most uzbek koreans migrated to  uzbekistan during the korean war taking  with them their cooking techniques and
bFzpqWXFSTo,2154800,2161359,applying them to local ingredients we  call them korean salads and they become  like a part of the culture now locals
bFzpqWXFSTo,2161359,2167520,with no korean ties at all make and sell  these fermented and pickled delights in  markets across the country so they
bFzpqWXFSTo,2167520,2172880,brought it and it caught on big time  like sushi in l.a or pizza in new york  ah i think we should try something that
bFzpqWXFSTo,2172880,2180960,stuck out to me right here that looks  like stomach is that stomach yes sir can  we order some  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,2180960,2186320,oh that is stomach if i've seen stomach  i mean it's like fuzzy like a little  carpet that's just been soaked in some
bFzpqWXFSTo,2186320,2192720,kind of a chili sauce and vinegar let's  go for it  oh one i like it it has cheap aftertaste
bFzpqWXFSTo,2192720,2197920,yeah and free taste and during taste  i like the seasoning but then like the
bFzpqWXFSTo,2197920,2204400,intensity of the stomach still comes  through sheep's stomach is like uzbek  squid folks in korea loves quinn if  you're korean you can't have squid cheap
bFzpqWXFSTo,2204400,2209440,stomach might be the next best thing at  least texture-wise the taste is fairly  pungent and gamey but that's mostly been
bFzpqWXFSTo,2209440,2214960,masked by the pickling and seasoning and  everything else she's put on here i love  it there's never been a more true fusion
bFzpqWXFSTo,2214960,2219920,yeah than this right asian fusion at its  best absolutely
bFzpqWXFSTo,2220560,2227440,usb cuisine is shaped by its  availability and lack of availability of  certain ingredients for example seafood
bFzpqWXFSTo,2227440,2232960,if there's anything i know about this  country that is a unique fact is that it  is double land locked that means it is
bFzpqWXFSTo,2232960,2238960,landlocked and every country around it  is also landlocked so it's very far from  the ocean
bFzpqWXFSTo,2238960,2246320,all the fish here come from nearby  rivers or lakes including this snakehead  fish oh it's so big oh
bFzpqWXFSTo,2246320,2253119,that is a massive river fish oh  fantastic you got a little bit of i get
bFzpqWXFSTo,2253119,2258799,a lot of it man not a little bit i hate  drinking i think we should
bFzpqWXFSTo,2260480,2266800,in this country there's one meat that  reigns supreme among all others from  five-star dining to simple street food
bFzpqWXFSTo,2266800,2273280,the fat tail sheep is an indispensable  and foundational part of uzbek cuisine  we have another food we track this man
bFzpqWXFSTo,2273280,2279119,down asalam alaikum this is a mobile  vendor inside he has samsung
bFzpqWXFSTo,2279119,2285520,samsa is a traditional central asian  pastry stuffed with meat or vegetables  unlike their fried cousin the samosa
bFzpqWXFSTo,2285520,2291359,these guys are always baked in the  tandoor oven here he's got a giant hot  oven it's still warm on the outside
bFzpqWXFSTo,2291359,2297760,there's some embers on the inside these  samsa are homemade crafted with dough  potatoes and minced fat tail sheep
bFzpqWXFSTo,2297760,2303920,locally known as dumba to cook they're  stuck to the walls of this very heavy  portable clay oven and carted to the
bFzpqWXFSTo,2303920,2312280,market so he just has something to  scrape it off the wall and then he  catches it in a pan oh thank you cheers
bFzpqWXFSTo,2312480,2318000,look at that it's steaming oh this is  incredible there's a ton of onion flavor  in there and then some of the fat from
bFzpqWXFSTo,2318000,2324480,the sheep is just extra juicy almost  buttery all with this nice chewy dough  wrapped around the outside oh my gosh i
bFzpqWXFSTo,2324480,2331599,love it  from doomba in the samsa to eating dumbo  sausage or the doomba you find in plum
bFzpqWXFSTo,2331599,2337599,this meat is used everywhere in  uzbekistan  so right now i want to head to a dumba
bFzpqWXFSTo,2337599,2343839,farm and meet the doomba at its source  this is joydon sheep farm located in the
bFzpqWXFSTo,2343839,2348960,city suburbs here they house 200 sheep  with up to 100 being sold each month
bFzpqWXFSTo,2348960,2356000,[Music]  right now we've come to a suburban farm  we're slowly backing up as we get closer
bFzpqWXFSTo,2356000,2361200,and closer to the local sheep these  sheep are like no sheep you have ever  seen before
bFzpqWXFSTo,2361200,2366240,this is the famous mutant looking fat  tail sheep it's like a shape from avatar
bFzpqWXFSTo,2366240,2373280,a breed distinctive for their bubbly  posterior to me right there that is  uzbek cuisine
bFzpqWXFSTo,2373280,2379040,although it's my first time seeing them  in person it turns out this species  makes up one-fourth of the world's sheep
bFzpqWXFSTo,2379040,2385599,population for me this is how chip  should look like so if i see any other  type of sheet for me they're like why
bFzpqWXFSTo,2385599,2391920,those sheep look like not a sheep in  fact variations of this animal are  priced and bred all over asia the middle
bFzpqWXFSTo,2391920,2399760,east and africa adored for having fat  deposits in all the right places the  lamp plays a centerpiece in the uzbek
bFzpqWXFSTo,2399760,2404960,culinary like everything made of sheep  absolutely tastes better sells better so
bFzpqWXFSTo,2404960,2412640,that's why they use sheep like  constantly in everything they can  alright we want to capture one i'm going  to grab the leg
bFzpqWXFSTo,2412640,2419359,you do it slowly you go slower you don't  attack suddenly you're like you know  foreplay man
bFzpqWXFSTo,2420240,2425839,okay good and now you grab the neck oh  now grab it like this yeah okay and hold
bFzpqWXFSTo,2425839,2431680,it hold it hold it hold it man  this is not what i wanted  this is not my intention at all dude
bFzpqWXFSTo,2431680,2438480,change your position  okay there you go you can see they have  a thick neck big old belly and then this
bFzpqWXFSTo,2438480,2442160,back here the prized part
bFzpqWXFSTo,2444240,2450000,oh yes i'm sorry guys this video is  demonetized but would you look at that  all right i'm gonna let it go all right
bFzpqWXFSTo,2450000,2455200,you did well i'm sorry  does the farm have an hr department uh i
bFzpqWXFSTo,2455200,2461079,think so  i'm in trouble i gotta get my story  straight
bFzpqWXFSTo,2462510,2468800,[Music]  i'm buying one of these sheep and we're
bFzpqWXFSTo,2468800,2475119,taking it to a mad food scientist who's  going to turn it into a long list of  dishes some of which i'm excited for and
bFzpqWXFSTo,2475119,2479078,some that scare me
bFzpqWXFSTo,2480210,2493760,[Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,2493760,2499440,the sheep is quickly slaughtered the  hull away and its blood is drained part  of the skinning process includes an
bFzpqWXFSTo,2499440,2505760,ancient technique that goes back  generations so right behind me one of  the most unusual preparations i've ever
bFzpqWXFSTo,2505760,2511440,seen the butcher makes a small incision  in the leg of the animal this is a  technique i've seen done the modern way
bFzpqWXFSTo,2511440,2517839,then he uses his mouth to blow air  inside for example in mexico they used  an air hose and they stick it in the
bFzpqWXFSTo,2517839,2524079,animal between its muscle and its skin  and they inflate it this is done to  create separation between the skin and
bFzpqWXFSTo,2524079,2530079,the muscle making it easier to remove  later on that is  super unique something crazy that i have
bFzpqWXFSTo,2530079,2538960,never seen i mean this is how it was  done originally before there were  compressors and machines i could blow  the air in it had to be done manually or
bFzpqWXFSTo,2538960,2543520,multiple mouthfully orally orally
bFzpqWXFSTo,2545280,2550960,[Music]  hey cruz yes sir today i'm very excited
bFzpqWXFSTo,2550960,2557680,because we're going to be trying out  about five or six different dishes from  this one creature all made by this chef  sir assalamu alaikum meet our culinary
bFzpqWXFSTo,2557680,2563520,superstar the mad food scientist chef no  sir he has a lot of dishes in mind for  today made with all different parts of
bFzpqWXFSTo,2563520,2568880,this animal but the first one we're  gonna try the cruise  is what first one is gonna be raw
bFzpqWXFSTo,2568880,2575680,sashimi sheep fat  to make sheep sashimi the chef cuts a  thin slice of doomba or the sheep's tail
bFzpqWXFSTo,2575680,2581280,fat spice it up with chili salt and  you're ready to go first of all it's  still warm from the animal's like body
bFzpqWXFSTo,2581280,2588319,temperature it's really soft it's  stretchy has an odor has a little bit of  an odor but don't we all
bFzpqWXFSTo,2588319,2595920,we do let's go for it  oh it's a big piece
bFzpqWXFSTo,2596640,2602680,oh it's so gushy hold on  you can't do it
bFzpqWXFSTo,2603920,2609520,[Laughter]  oh my god  bro this is someone's culture oh it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,2609520,2615599,yours how do you feel i almost threw up  but you didn't i didn't did you spit it  out no no i did it yeah yeah all right
bFzpqWXFSTo,2615599,2622240,here we go  oh i'm gonna taste that for days the fat  has coated my mouth it's just so you
bFzpqWXFSTo,2622240,2628480,chew when you chew and you chew and  nothing's happening it's not too bad if  you just got a smaller piece the chili  salt helps a lot it makes it more
bFzpqWXFSTo,2628480,2636720,palatable all right i think this is a  great experience of first course an  upper teeth to get our stomachs excited  and ready for more thank you chef
bFzpqWXFSTo,2639200,2645200,fortunately our next dish involves a lot  more heat what would you call that dumba  the chef starts by slicing up the
bFzpqWXFSTo,2645200,2652319,sheep's organs what is jigar jigar is a  liver he slices and dices the heart  kidney liver and even the sheep's balls
bFzpqWXFSTo,2652319,2658000,butt liver what liver in a hot khazan as  always he starts with the doomba cubes
bFzpqWXFSTo,2658000,2663839,when the fat renders down he adds the  slices of organs and lets them fry  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,2663839,2670800,season with salt and cumin then cover  for 15 minutes and serve  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,2670800,2675920,let's start with liver  wow nice it's a little dry inside yeah
bFzpqWXFSTo,2675920,2682079,it's really hard to make a liver not  like that where it's like a little  chalky but i think it's done good it's  not super dry which is kind of as dry as
bFzpqWXFSTo,2682079,2688079,most livers are the cooking style it  starts out really fried but then why do  a lot of people steam after that
bFzpqWXFSTo,2688079,2694079,if you just fry it it becomes kind of  too much chewy we don't want that  absolutely not yeah
bFzpqWXFSTo,2694079,2700240,right here we have a kidney cheers  cheese mommy  mm-hmm it's tasty very tasty oh now i
bFzpqWXFSTo,2700240,2706480,taste the cumin much more seasoning  really blends it and gives really nice  aftertaste i like that that's more juicy
bFzpqWXFSTo,2706480,2712079,than the liver yeah liver is little dry  in good way  all right these are the lungs it looks
bFzpqWXFSTo,2712079,2717119,like snoop dog songs they're so dark and  just completely torched let's see
bFzpqWXFSTo,2717119,2723440,it's like mushrooms a texture it's like  a grilled portabella and it doesn't have  like strong flavor no not at all someone
bFzpqWXFSTo,2723440,2729520,gives you and says it's a mushroom you  would buy it that's really unique i did  not expect that so this is excellent the  meat tastes delicious every different
bFzpqWXFSTo,2729520,2735280,organ has a little bit different texture  and slightly different taste delicious  10 out of 10.
bFzpqWXFSTo,2736190,2742400,[Music]  appetizer number three it just doesn't  stop it cruise look at this do you know
bFzpqWXFSTo,2742400,2747760,what that is yeah it's a bowl skip it's  a balls kebab these doodads are chopped  up and seasoned with just a little bit
bFzpqWXFSTo,2747760,2753680,of chili salt i'm looking at this volume  of balls here and i'm thinking this  sheep had four to five balls no we had
bFzpqWXFSTo,2753680,2760480,to like buy separately then he skewers  up those testicular cross sections like  a homemade sticks it's a special treat
bFzpqWXFSTo,2760480,2767119,juniper tree it gives the taste as well  we're not just having pure unmitigated  balls it has some juniper flavors in
bFzpqWXFSTo,2767119,2773200,there too oh fantastic he grills them  for about 15 minutes i'm curious you  know in a lot of countries when you eat
bFzpqWXFSTo,2773200,2781040,something like this it gives you some  kind of a benefit something to do with  masculinity when we eat this is this  going to give me superpowers
bFzpqWXFSTo,2781200,2787359,she says like if you really believe in  it it might work if not it just you know  taste the dish the power of positive
bFzpqWXFSTo,2787359,2792720,thinking in the bedroom my new book by  sunny side all right cheers
bFzpqWXFSTo,2796079,2801440,it's actually quite meaty rather than  being like so fatty and gelatinous it's  really soft unlike any other organ this
bFzpqWXFSTo,2801440,2806800,is really like its own feeling it's soft  it's supple it's uh
bFzpqWXFSTo,2806960,2813250,delicate all those things chef i think  you've done an excellent job i think  it's very good i'm quite stunned and  very impressed well done
bFzpqWXFSTo,2813250,2818480,[Music]  chef no sir has studied classic  traditional uzbek cuisine but he also
bFzpqWXFSTo,2818480,2825040,isn't afraid to make his own creations  like this dish  it starts with a giant web of coal fat
bFzpqWXFSTo,2825040,2831760,this fatty membrane normally encases the  sheep's digestive organs but he's found  a new use for it
bFzpqWXFSTo,2831760,2837920,he seasons it with chili salt now onto  the liver the liver is cut into thinner  slices and it's stuffed with crushed
bFzpqWXFSTo,2837920,2843040,walnuts place that on top of the coal  fat and wrap it up like a christmas  present
bFzpqWXFSTo,2843040,2848890,the liver grills for about 20 minutes  enough to cook it most of the way  through but not enough to dry it out
bFzpqWXFSTo,2848890,2855520,[Music]  the organ preparation that i see in  uzbekistan is some of the most unique  i've seen anywhere in the world starting
bFzpqWXFSTo,2855520,2861839,with lungs filled with milk that was a  couple of episodes ago and then here  liver stuffed with walnuts and wrapped
bFzpqWXFSTo,2861839,2865760,with coal fat are you ready yeah let's  do it
bFzpqWXFSTo,2866880,2873280,[Laughter]  it's so good so the issue with liver a  lot of times is it can get kind of dry
bFzpqWXFSTo,2873280,2878319,and it's hard to make it really be juicy  but they've wrapped it with that fat and  then inside you've got those walnuts
bFzpqWXFSTo,2878319,2884240,that have kept their crunch so it's just  a beautiful texture to accompany the  liver the call fat alone is reduced in
bFzpqWXFSTo,2884240,2890079,size it wraps even tighter around the  liver and parts of it like this get  really crunchy
bFzpqWXFSTo,2890800,2895920,full of flavor and nothing here is  gaming or muttoning that's a genius so  that is a liver i love it this other
bFzpqWXFSTo,2895920,2900960,food is something i've never even seen  attempted he must have invented this  because what we have here inside of the
bFzpqWXFSTo,2900960,2907359,aluminum foil it is a quail egg wrapped  in coal fat  i'm not sure how i feel about this next
bFzpqWXFSTo,2907359,2914240,food which calls for eating actual egg  shells it's my first time seeing this  small delicate quail eggs are wrapped in
bFzpqWXFSTo,2914240,2920559,coal fat the quail eggs are still raw at  this point it's like you know hardcore m  ms he showers them with a massive dose
bFzpqWXFSTo,2920559,2926319,of salt then rolls them up  wrap it in tin foil toss it on the grill  and when you've built up enough courage
bFzpqWXFSTo,2926319,2940379,to eat take it off and give it a try  should we go for it let's  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,2940839,2946000,go it's hot yeah i thought that the  shell would be most disturbing thing
bFzpqWXFSTo,2946000,2952319,about it but it turns out it's like a  list of obstruction well yeah you feel  it crunching but it breaks into a
bFzpqWXFSTo,2952319,2957599,million pieces in your mouth and it  dissolves pretty easily yeah what was  the toughest part for you the smell of
bFzpqWXFSTo,2957599,2965200,lamb yeah it was that first bite i was  like wait is this an egg from a sheep  that is a wild experience
bFzpqWXFSTo,2965200,2971760,now that the organs and all 13 of this  sheep's testicles are gone it's time to  focus on the protein i've asked chef no
bFzpqWXFSTo,2971760,2979520,sir for a glorious climactic ending to  this eclectic tasting menu and wait  until you see this
bFzpqWXFSTo,2979680,2986720,the meat is cut down to manageable  chunks then he fills the kazan with  cooking oil and fry some potatoes
bFzpqWXFSTo,2986720,2993440,patience we're building up to something  when the potatoes are done they're  removed and then he adds the meat
bFzpqWXFSTo,2993440,2999680,now the most crucial ingredient an  entire freaking pumpkin he cuts it open  and removes the seeds fills it with
bFzpqWXFSTo,2999680,3005440,butter and honey  then places the whole thing on top of  the frying meat add back the fried
bFzpqWXFSTo,3005440,3011520,potatoes and water cover it up and let  it cook for over an hour  when it's complete garnish with whatever

bFzpqWXFSTo,3159920,3167839,wranglers who catch your dinner by hand  this thing is like a snake all the  action starts right here
bFzpqWXFSTo,3167920,3173040,we've just come to the bread district  this is a patch of the highway with tons  of different bread shops making bread
bFzpqWXFSTo,3173040,3180240,absolutely fresh like most bakeries a  day at pad tier 13 starts with loads of  dough and that is where the similarities
bFzpqWXFSTo,3180240,3186240,end for extra richness the dough here is  made with only flour and butter it  starts with the portioning the balling
bFzpqWXFSTo,3186240,3191520,the rolling it out  and then they put the print they make a  special design you'll see that every
bFzpqWXFSTo,3191520,3197520,bread here has an identity  [Music]  then the dough is glazed with more
bFzpqWXFSTo,3197520,3202559,butter  and sent to the walk-in oven
bFzpqWXFSTo,3202960,3209119,i've seen a multitude of fiery tandoor  designs around this country and the  world so big you could fit like six
bFzpqWXFSTo,3209119,3215680,human bodies in here but these tan doors  stand apart it's the size of a freaking  walk-in closet
bFzpqWXFSTo,3215680,3224160,inside the dough island jamma to the  wall in one quick swift motion so the  baker doesn't spontaneously combust
bFzpqWXFSTo,3227200,3234000,after 15 minutes it's ready to take out  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,3234000,3240000,this is some heavy dense beautiful bread  they press in the phone number something  we saw already at a previous market
bFzpqWXFSTo,3240000,3245280,that's a business card brother the name  of a guy and his phone number this one  comes with the address name phone number
bFzpqWXFSTo,3245280,3251680,and the location but i think they have  to take to the next level i suggest them  to do the qr code you have to be careful  though if it bakes the wrong way you're
bFzpqWXFSTo,3251680,3258000,gonna send them to north korea yeah  exactly then with 20 years of experience  hat tier 13 now churns out 4 000

bFzpqWXFSTo,3271760,3277359,oh some parts doughy some parts kind of  crackery and crispy hot steamy and  satisfying it's more like pie than
bFzpqWXFSTo,3277359,3283119,regular bread taste wise yeah it's very  like pie crust you just need to fill it  with meringue or apple jam uzbekistan is
bFzpqWXFSTo,3283119,3288160,such an intersection of so many  different types of food like yes people  love rice but people equally love bread
bFzpqWXFSTo,3288160,3293440,i don't think you could call this either  a rice nation or a bread nation yeah  that
bFzpqWXFSTo,3293440,3300640,is nice  if you think bread sticking is  impressive then check this out  the top level tandoor daredevils of
bFzpqWXFSTo,3300640,3305839,tandir samsa markazi going face deep  into fire pits to stick giant samsa of
bFzpqWXFSTo,3305839,3312960,all kinds to the walls oh should i try  it well okay hold on  but what is an uzbek samsa well it all
bFzpqWXFSTo,3312960,3319440,starts with the dough  what is in here water eggs and a floor  they prepared it one day before so in
bFzpqWXFSTo,3319440,3325119,the morning it's all good so they can  start a perfect samsa casing requires a  thicker middle section and a thinner rim
bFzpqWXFSTo,3325119,3330160,creating that perfect balance requires a  special rolling pin this is the cutest  rolling pin i've ever seen in my life i
bFzpqWXFSTo,3330160,3335839,want to take one of these home with me  here every man uses his own pin in his  own way he really rolls it so hard it
bFzpqWXFSTo,3335839,3341040,makes a sound  and every time he does it it gives me  extreme anxiety i'm not sure why it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,3341040,3346319,like somebody trying to knock down my  door and break in and do bad things to  me how come he whacks it in such an
bFzpqWXFSTo,3346319,3351760,intense loud way  and you're so gentle name of the gin man
bFzpqWXFSTo,3351760,3359920,it depends on the rolling pin it says i  have a thinner one so i can whack it i  press it and make it steam
bFzpqWXFSTo,3360799,3366170,with our wrappers ready it's time for  the stuffing which includes some protein  you might not be prepared for
bFzpqWXFSTo,3366170,3373359,[Music]  what is the secret behind a good samsung
bFzpqWXFSTo,3373359,3380240,obviously fresh ingredients but more  important is the balance it's the  master's eye which can tell that i
bFzpqWXFSTo,3380240,3386160,should put more meat or i should put  less meat over 16 years of samsara r d  and this restaurant has come up with a
bFzpqWXFSTo,3386160,3392319,loaded menu of 16 different types of  samsung one yeah try it's cooked it's a  horse meat by the way
bFzpqWXFSTo,3392319,3397359,horse meat  that's right bojack horse meat it's a
bFzpqWXFSTo,3397359,3402960,delicacy not only here but in other  parts of asia and europe
bFzpqWXFSTo,3403599,3409040,tastes too to me saltiness pepperonis  cold fatty and delicious the horse  samsung is stuffed with chopped beet a
bFzpqWXFSTo,3409040,3415040,quail and a generous portion of horse  sausage how come the horse meat here is  always in the form of a sausage and not
bFzpqWXFSTo,3415040,3421680,like a steak that's a good question i  have to think about it is it more  palatable because you can't see any  horse body parts you grind it into a
bFzpqWXFSTo,3421680,3428559,sausage and i have no emotional  attachment to this sausage other than my  absolute love for sausages  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,3428559,3434160,after stuffing and wrapping it's time to  head to the ovens  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,3434160,3439839,this tandoor is being loaded up with six  types of samsung and kabob everything is  going to take a different amount of time
bFzpqWXFSTo,3439839,3446160,it takes a true master to really figure  out what he's doing and to know when to  put it in but more importantly one to  take it out the entire wall's real
bFzpqWXFSTo,3446160,3452070,estate is put to use he's sticking it to  the walls to the ceiling oh should i try  it here
bFzpqWXFSTo,3452070,3457520,[Music]  boom it stayed in there that's nice they
bFzpqWXFSTo,3457520,3462880,spray in some water and close the lid  turning the oven into a steam room
bFzpqWXFSTo,3462880,3468240,to seal the heat inside top it with  heavy stacks of ceramic dishes it's  actually going to take about 40 minutes
bFzpqWXFSTo,3468240,3474520,and then we're gonna see this come out  and we're gonna try it hot fresh and  juicy
bFzpqWXFSTo,3474880,3480640,outside the restaurant and inside the  dining hall the atmosphere is also  heating up with customers flooding in
bFzpqWXFSTo,3480640,3487359,waiting to get their hands on the first  batch of the day on an average day over  1 000 samsung can be sold now the
bFzpqWXFSTo,3487359,3493920,steaming is about finished he's taking  off these plates he's going to remove  the lid we're going to get a lot of  steam and then see what the final result
bFzpqWXFSTo,3493920,3500000,is for all these different samsung  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,3500000,3506559,you can smell aroma man santa is in the  air bro they are golden brown on the  outside it is steamy it is beautiful it
bFzpqWXFSTo,3506559,3511920,is sometime  extracting the samsa is the easy part
bFzpqWXFSTo,3511920,3516520,managing the crowds is another story
bFzpqWXFSTo,3517440,3523680,it's harder to coordinate than i thought  some people are saying right now hey i  got my ticket i want to go so everyone  wants it fresh out of the oven and it
bFzpqWXFSTo,3523680,3528720,can't stay in here forever there's like  a limited window of time so he has to  really organize his cooking and his
bFzpqWXFSTo,3528720,3535760,delivery it's just complete chaos  the more happy patrons that grab their  fresh steaming samsa the closer i am to
bFzpqWXFSTo,3535760,3541839,tasting one for myself right here we  have two of the kebabs usually kebabs  they'll just be put over a grill or
bFzpqWXFSTo,3541839,3546880,sometimes leaned into a tan door here he  stuffed the kebabs directly on the wall
bFzpqWXFSTo,3546880,3552000,of this oven so this is the side that  was on the wall it's a little bit more  wet looking and then here there's kind
bFzpqWXFSTo,3552000,3558119,of a crunchy crust that's developed on  the outside that was facing the fire
bFzpqWXFSTo,3559440,3565839,it's hot loaded with spices i'm like  what does it care about man it tastes  really different it has so much  seasoning on there it's interesting
bFzpqWXFSTo,3565839,3571359,because it has a crust on it but  essentially the meat has kind of steamed  this is nice it's cold outside but it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,3571359,3577200,warm in my belly since we are standing  here i wonder if we could risk trying  one more if you're feeling so hungry you
bFzpqWXFSTo,3577200,3584000,could eat a horse sausage this next one  is for you okay so that is like our  little horse sausage burrito you can see
bFzpqWXFSTo,3584000,3589760,how it was hanging on the wall because  the gravity is kind of pulled it down  it's golden brown a little bit of black
bFzpqWXFSTo,3589760,3596400,stuff but that's fine and then here the  crusty part that was stuck to the wall  oh that's going to be hot af
bFzpqWXFSTo,3596720,3603520,uh-huh  man there's nowhere i'd rather be right  now it's about 40 degrees outside just  above freezing and this is like my hand
bFzpqWXFSTo,3603520,3610000,warmer and my tummy warmer there's just  so much heat moisture and hot meat in  there
bFzpqWXFSTo,3610000,3616480,epic reveal dude  similar seasoning cumin salt you can
bFzpqWXFSTo,3616480,3621599,taste the horse sausage is juicy and  delicious the quail egg in there and  then just big chunks of beef old
bFzpqWXFSTo,3621599,3627280,macdonald had a farm and this whole farm  is inside of this samsung  there's a lot of things we haven't tried
bFzpqWXFSTo,3627280,3633040,yet there's the bowl there's other giant  samsa so we're gonna order some now head  inside and try it out properly our
bFzpqWXFSTo,3633040,3639070,central asian dumpling feast includes  this restaurant's greatest hits let's  start with samsa in a bowl
bFzpqWXFSTo,3639070,3645200,[Music]  [Applause]  an entire clay vessel is filled with  chopped beef and lamb skirt then wrapped
bFzpqWXFSTo,3645200,3651920,inside the dough and slapped onto the  tan door wall  once out of the oven the dough lid is
bFzpqWXFSTo,3651920,3657280,cut open and topped with a scoop of  marrow soup we've got the beef we've got  the horse we've got quail eggs basically
bFzpqWXFSTo,3657280,3663599,everything we just tried outside but in  bowl form  that's a huge difference actually now i
bFzpqWXFSTo,3663599,3671640,understand the purpose of the bowl it  contains a liquid more so everything is  extra juicier yeah
bFzpqWXFSTo,3671760,3677440,nice man people might think that it is a  lot of oil but it's own contoured it's  like a very clean soup delicious very
bFzpqWXFSTo,3677440,3682799,rich but i like it to top off the  world's heaviest breakfast the deluxe  some sauce
bFzpqWXFSTo,3682799,3689520,they put everything they could possibly  found and maybe something more cow  tongue chopped beef lamb sausage horse
bFzpqWXFSTo,3689520,3697960,sausage lamb skirt quail egg pistachios  and cheese all wrapped and baked
bFzpqWXFSTo,3698400,3704559,oh yes the unveiling  look at this they do not mess around  with the meat so much meat you know how
bFzpqWXFSTo,3704559,3710400,much this costs seven bucks that's a  good deal dude it can feed the whole  family right
bFzpqWXFSTo,3711440,3716720,with the vegetables way different flavor  yeah tastes almost like a stew it's like  when you get grilled chilies and bell
bFzpqWXFSTo,3716720,3722960,peppers and onions with potatoes it  literally has its own soup it's wild  it's like a liquid in here and it's not
bFzpqWXFSTo,3722960,3728160,fat it's just the juice of the meat and  the rest of the ingredients i'm blown  away before i came to uzbekistan we had
bFzpqWXFSTo,3728160,3733440,some and a much different scale there's  like an independent guy doing his own  thing he had a couple 10 doors but here
bFzpqWXFSTo,3733440,3739200,what they're doing here is very  impressive to be able to do pretty  complex food that has to be timed  perfectly and to get it in people's
bFzpqWXFSTo,3739200,3745119,hands at the perfect time while it's  still hot sometimes should we call today  no no man i need a nap after this
bFzpqWXFSTo,3745119,3752079,the opposite of fire is water but at our  next location i'm more concerned about  what's in the water
bFzpqWXFSTo,3752079,3758319,this thing is like a snake whoa  we're standing in front of on a
bFzpqWXFSTo,3758319,3765440,restaurant offering fresh fish recently  plucked from a nearby river in front of  us a catfish weighing in at over 20
bFzpqWXFSTo,3765440,3771359,pounds  this is a big boy they usually grow into
bFzpqWXFSTo,3771359,3776799,like a human size  this thing looks like a giant tadpole as  far as i'm concerned it looks like it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,3776799,3782640,going to become a big frog one day how  much beer has this fish been drinking  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,3782640,3789760,this little fatty will be cooked up two  ways kebabs and stewed  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,3789760,3795760,in this double landlocked country dining  of fresh fish is a treat reserved for  those who make the trip here near the
bFzpqWXFSTo,3795760,3802000,cerdaria river  if you want to know what's on the menu  just look in the water when you go to
bFzpqWXFSTo,3802000,3807359,tashkent can you see restaurants like  this with the live fish in front very  seldom yeah you got to keep them on life
bFzpqWXFSTo,3807359,3812559,support you have to have a defibrillator  on the way to taj can stay alive just
bFzpqWXFSTo,3812559,3818160,with a huge tank with the water oh  that's a better idea  after the catfish is cleaned it hangs
bFzpqWXFSTo,3818160,3823359,for a few minutes so the blood can drain  besides catfish carp and whitefish are
bFzpqWXFSTo,3823359,3828400,also familiar faces at this restaurant  is this one napping
bFzpqWXFSTo,3829440,3834960,it was freshly caught so he's like now  decompressing but he will adjust
bFzpqWXFSTo,3835839,3840880,now he's trying to pull it so he wants  you to show that it's still alive quite  unsuccessfully
bFzpqWXFSTo,3840880,3846000,hey  it just swam away you're right it was  decompressing it was like i've had quite
bFzpqWXFSTo,3846000,3852960,a day i don't even know where i am now i  suddenly have 57 roommates  back to our giant catfish half of it is
bFzpqWXFSTo,3852960,3858900,portioned  then skewered and tossed on the grill
bFzpqWXFSTo,3858900,3867599,[Applause]  [Music]  they season the fish with a blend of  salt paprika parsley and pepper
bFzpqWXFSTo,3867599,3875119,oh very beautiful  from the sign the cross section looks  very juicy let's try it out
bFzpqWXFSTo,3876640,3883200,nice crispy skin a little bit of  seasoning on there simple  straightforward definitely catfish is  known for the fat so you can feel it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,3883200,3888559,not a lean it's like fatty and with this  fish you can really taste the minerality  you can taste the river right some
bFzpqWXFSTo,3888559,3894799,people don't love that riveriness that  minerality but guess what  i do
bFzpqWXFSTo,3894799,3901200,true fish cooked two incredible ways  this is the snakehead fish whole thing  scored and fried it looks glorious and
bFzpqWXFSTo,3901200,3908319,then here the catfish i think we should  start with this and end with this  the snakehead fish is cleaned scored and
bFzpqWXFSTo,3908319,3916000,marinated with salt  they deep fry the whole thing until it  looks like modern art
bFzpqWXFSTo,3916000,3922480,you rip off a little fish steak this  looks nice thin cut extra fried crispy  on the outside feels juicy on the inside
bFzpqWXFSTo,3922480,3927680,let's try it out  [Music]  tastes stinky at all really good i like
bFzpqWXFSTo,3927680,3933200,it deep fried little like salty it's  like a really i'd say like a snack food  you know the trash is greasy it doesn't
bFzpqWXFSTo,3933200,3938480,taste nearly as rivery as the catfish it  doesn't have that um crazy kind of  mineral taste to it catfish usually
bFzpqWXFSTo,3938480,3945490,leaves in the bottom like a spongebob so  it ends up eating everything  would you eat spongebob if you could
bFzpqWXFSTo,3945490,3948690,[Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,3950640,3956079,now this is an epic treat  the catfish meat is deep fried along
bFzpqWXFSTo,3956079,3963200,with the head  [Music]  in a khazan toss in butter and layer
bFzpqWXFSTo,3963200,3969920,fried fish meat with herbs and veggies  finish with the head as the cherry on
bFzpqWXFSTo,3969920,3972160,top
bFzpqWXFSTo,3975760,3982160,after about 20 minutes the alluring  fragrance escaping the pan will let you  know it's ready
bFzpqWXFSTo,3982160,3987440,[Music]  i don't even know where to start we have
bFzpqWXFSTo,3987440,3993440,the head on top but all around it  there's a ton of big pieces of fish i'm  going to try to pull out this meat
bFzpqWXFSTo,3993440,3998799,i like it a little spongy that's about  spongebob spongy not that level but if  it's spongy way different array of
bFzpqWXFSTo,3998799,4003920,seasonings and spices here so what we  had already that was grilled much more  simple straightforward this has a much
bFzpqWXFSTo,4003920,4009039,more depth of flavor to it you want to  try soup yeah  yeah
bFzpqWXFSTo,4009039,4015359,that's really good beautiful delicious  super thick broth it's starting to warm  me up a little bit imagine putting some  ramen that would be really like a hot
bFzpqWXFSTo,4015359,4021039,pot  yeah  i'm going gonna give it a little bit of  a haircut they put all the veggies on
bFzpqWXFSTo,4021039,4028160,here they've kind of scored the head as  well so it looks a bit gnarly like it  got some prison scarf i'm gonna grab  just some cheek meat fish head is priced
bFzpqWXFSTo,4028160,4034240,all over the world and the most sacred  part is the cheeks  honestly i couldn't tell the difference
bFzpqWXFSTo,4034240,4039760,it tastes like just other parts  more soft not so spongy seasonings have  worked their way into there all right
bFzpqWXFSTo,4039760,4047440,let's open this mouth  in here we're gonna see a tongue oh  wow hi it's exhaling its final breath
bFzpqWXFSTo,4047440,4054079,what note is this time to  say goodbye  so this is like this part the bottom jaw
bFzpqWXFSTo,4054079,4058960,it looks warm plump juicy and overall  just very nice
bFzpqWXFSTo,4059440,4067280,completely different huh yeah and  everything with that broth it's so  buttery it's so flavorful it's so deep  is this the tongue i want to say yes
bFzpqWXFSTo,4067359,4073599,very gelatinous yeah it kind of just  crumbled and fell apart in my mouth it  tastes like a bone marrow maybe your  piece did your piece had a bit more fat
bFzpqWXFSTo,4073599,4079839,than mine so we succeeded we did have  tongue yeah so fish do speak because why  they need tongue if they don't speak you
bFzpqWXFSTo,4079839,4085680,know what i always think people are like  oh if we mean aliens can we understand  what they say we don't even know what  dolphins are saying i don't even know
bFzpqWXFSTo,4085680,4093839,what you're saying at the time  now you're gonna witness one of central  asia's most rarely seen food big reveal
bFzpqWXFSTo,4093839,4100880,is steaming  this is  this dish is only prepared once a year
bFzpqWXFSTo,4100880,4106719,for the uzbek navru's holiday  and this year they're making a lot well
bFzpqWXFSTo,4106719,4114079,over a thousand pounds how are you doing  over there on that side i feel like the  wind's only coming towards me i'm  feeling pretty good
bFzpqWXFSTo,4114960,4121440,once you see how it's made you'll  understand why it's not so common what  they're doing right now seems easy  except for it's freezing outside the
bFzpqWXFSTo,4121440,4127040,making from beginning to end takes over  24 hours people hear tough as actual
bFzpqWXFSTo,4127040,4132480,nails with this painfully long and  difficult process this is the final  product
bFzpqWXFSTo,4132480,4137758,all starts with one simple task well  good morning everybody it is 5am here in
bFzpqWXFSTo,4137758,4145199,uzbekistan we are in the city of  namangan and we are up very early for a  special reason is to come here and see
bFzpqWXFSTo,4145199,4152640,this but the crews perhaps you could  tell me what i'm looking at what you're  looking at is the wheat sprout
bFzpqWXFSTo,4152640,4159040,this wheat is not milled for flour  instead we're after the natural sweet  juice inside to get the sprouts ready
bFzpqWXFSTo,4159040,4165040,for this moment they've been watered  four times a day for the last three days  right here in their home how much has
bFzpqWXFSTo,4165040,4172080,this pile grown since it started  we grew hundred percent if you would  invest early ipo you would get hundred
bFzpqWXFSTo,4172080,4178238,percent roy bro  simple weed sprouts are the main
bFzpqWXFSTo,4178238,4183359,ingredient for sumilac but there's  nothing simple about the food making  process we're about to witness a lot of
bFzpqWXFSTo,4183359,4190080,the sumolac is going to be made today  over a ton is this enough this is  decentralized way of doing it you have
bFzpqWXFSTo,4190080,4195679,to expect 30 more of the different  houses  after collecting the weed sprouts they
bFzpqWXFSTo,4195679,4201440,must be brought to a grinder to help  release the juices inside we've come to  our next location this is the grinding
bFzpqWXFSTo,4201440,4207440,place with the grinding lady hi how you  doing  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,4207440,4213280,so what i'm curious about is that this  is a dessert but you don't add any sugar  to it later on no that means all the
bFzpqWXFSTo,4213280,4221198,sweetness has to be coming from this so  i'm dying to try out the actual rough  raw ingredients right now
bFzpqWXFSTo,4221840,4227040,so at first it tastes like something  that would go on a salad next to the  croutons and the diced tomatoes yeah and  then there's like a little bit of a
bFzpqWXFSTo,4227040,4232239,sweetness to it almost a little vanilla  too  so we are here at the final site where
bFzpqWXFSTo,4232239,4237600,all the cooking and all the fun is going  to happen i really admire the commitment  of the people here because it is just a
bFzpqWXFSTo,4237600,4242880,few degrees above freezing and some  people are just wearing like slippers  i'm freezing my ass off i don't know how
bFzpqWXFSTo,4242880,4248080,they do it right here the wheat sprouts  have been ground they've been soaking  water for about half an hour and they
bFzpqWXFSTo,4248080,4254640,put it through this net this mesh cloth  is going to allow all the liquid to  filter through and then they kind of  give it a squeeze this is what we want
bFzpqWXFSTo,4254640,4261920,right here this liquid oh confusion  confusion they don't have a place for  the refuse
bFzpqWXFSTo,4261920,4264480,solution
bFzpqWXFSTo,4270400,4276560,everyone's getting ready everyone is  pitching in in different ways some  people are bringing these big hazans or  setting them up getting them ready
bFzpqWXFSTo,4276560,4282239,putting the mud around them to seal them  some people are starting fires cleaning  so it's a huge group community effort
bFzpqWXFSTo,4282239,4288960,and by tomorrow morning we're gonna see  over a ton of this stuff be made and  given out for free to the public so that
bFzpqWXFSTo,4288960,4294480,is the big moment we're building up to  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,4294480,4300320,before the hazan even heats up the  ingredients are added  [Music]
bFzpqWXFSTo,4300320,4307360,cottonseed oil is spread around the pan  then they add rocks
bFzpqWXFSTo,4307360,4313600,that's right  river rocks are crucial to the process  and you'll find out why soon
bFzpqWXFSTo,4313600,4320880,now we're ready for that precious weed  sprout juice filtered and drained into  the kazan as the contents of the pan
bFzpqWXFSTo,4320880,4326840,continue to blend we're now ready for  the last ingredient  right here wheat
bFzpqWXFSTo,4326840,4333280,flour so they have wheat flour they pour  that into and then they kind of whisk it  about mix it in and get all the clumps
bFzpqWXFSTo,4333280,4340239,out of there so this is going to get a  lot more full and when it is they're  going to finally start the fire and get  this to boiling a bit this is miss
bFzpqWXFSTo,4340239,4346640,inobat and her family helping her to mix  in the wheat flour though everyone has a  slight twist to their strategy as i said
bFzpqWXFSTo,4346640,4351840,it is not just the women that we came  with today there are 10 different  cousins and so many people from the
bFzpqWXFSTo,4351840,4358000,community pitching in to make this event  happen some people have a stick some  people have a whisk and this lady has an
bFzpqWXFSTo,4358000,4363600,electrical mixer it's plugged into an  extension cord does this go all the way  to your house
bFzpqWXFSTo,4363600,4370880,we're in a park what is this even  plugged into it's brilliant i love it so  this is how you work smart not hard very
bFzpqWXFSTo,4370880,4376000,nice  oh i was gonna give her a fist bump but  she's actually holding the electrical in
bFzpqWXFSTo,4376000,4382960,the other hand at this point there are  no more ingredients to add we're just  gonna need a little bit of heat
bFzpqWXFSTo,4382960,4389600,as the fire begins to roar more  attention and care is required at each  vessel ensuring this liquid keeps moving
bFzpqWXFSTo,4389600,4396560,and doesn't burn potentially wasting  hours of effort remember those rocks as  they shift around they help create even
bFzpqWXFSTo,4396560,4401760,more motion so the liquid doesn't stick  the cruise yes it's wild to see the  progress that has happened in just a
bFzpqWXFSTo,4401760,4408880,couple hours i would be standing here  there's a reason i'm not there's a fire  blazing under the hazan
bFzpqWXFSTo,4408880,4412120,i was fine
bFzpqWXFSTo,4415360,4421120,she's like please go out of the fire and  also do some work but cruz you should  help me too right
bFzpqWXFSTo,4421120,4426400,so what is the technique here so what  you do is that you have to make sure  that it's not gonna stick under the
bFzpqWXFSTo,4426400,4432480,bottom yeah so you always have to scrap  the bottom no it's okay so  my favorite part is this lady does not
bFzpqWXFSTo,4432480,4438560,trust me at all i'm like no i insist  i'll do it and she's like no you won't  cause this is mine she will not let me
bFzpqWXFSTo,4438560,4444080,destroy this under her watch  this is bober park tomorrow is navroos
bFzpqWXFSTo,4444080,4451520,the most important holiday in uzbekistan  celebrating the start of the harvest  season every march 21st folks celebrate
bFzpqWXFSTo,4451520,4457760,with festivities and sumilac a  painstaking sweet made just once a year  on this day just in a short amount of
bFzpqWXFSTo,4457760,4463040,time after putting in the flour after  putting in all that wheat juice it's  become really thick are people doing
bFzpqWXFSTo,4463040,4469679,this overnight till 8 pm they're gonna  keep doing that and then they're gonna  close it for another 12 hours how many
bFzpqWXFSTo,4469679,4474880,more can you do before you need to hand  it to me  okay only two people they're gonna stay
bFzpqWXFSTo,4474880,4482400,for another 10 hours oh my gosh the  commitment here is unreal this is you  going to the extreme physically mentally
bFzpqWXFSTo,4482400,4488719,emotionally spiritually what is pushing  you right now to keep moving forward
bFzpqWXFSTo,4489840,4496400,so the main driving force for her is a  charity she's happy that a lot of people  are going to enjoy it and a lot of
bFzpqWXFSTo,4496400,4502880,people gonna like it i wish i could help  but she said absolutely not yeah i'm  gonna come back in five hours i'm gonna  bring you a gatorade i'm gonna bring you
bFzpqWXFSTo,4502880,4509520,a masseuse some salt tablets too and a  banana  yeah and in exchange you will get a suma
bFzpqWXFSTo,4509520,4515760,like you got a deal  yeah right now we are in a nearby market  because there is a lot of cooking to be
bFzpqWXFSTo,4515760,4522560,done over at the park where they're  making the simalaq so we picked up some  samsung now i know you're thinking uh  you guys have had some twice at one
bFzpqWXFSTo,4522560,4528239,place you had five different kinds oh  yes these are small  so it's different this guy is a mobile
bFzpqWXFSTo,4528239,4533920,vendor behind us it looks like his oven  probably weighs a ton yeah so inside  he's built a fire he has a couple
bFzpqWXFSTo,4533920,4540080,different types of stump side including  this these here are the baby bite size  version made with a flaky pastry dough
bFzpqWXFSTo,4540080,4547120,and stuffed with juicy mutton they come  in fours and you can tear it down to one  and look how cute that is huh
bFzpqWXFSTo,4547120,4553199,very nice  saltine fatty cuminy tons of onion juicy
bFzpqWXFSTo,4553199,4560080,mutton and a beautiful doughy wrapper  golden brown on the top that is the mini  sums up
bFzpqWXFSTo,4563920,4569360,the food tour continues behind us  something we actually have not tried yet  these are kebabs is this you bakus yeah
bFzpqWXFSTo,4569360,4574880,yes can you see me i feel like david  blaine coming on stage right now
bFzpqWXFSTo,4575520,4582080,you can find kebabs everywhere in  uzbekistan minced lamb beef or chicken  spiced wrapped around a skewer and
bFzpqWXFSTo,4582080,4587920,roasted over charcoal until they're  dripping with deliciousness not only is  he cooking he's like organizing them
bFzpqWXFSTo,4587920,4593520,according to where it's hottest where  it's coolest rotating them can you order  two now he's gonna hand it like out of
bFzpqWXFSTo,4593520,4600640,nowhere we see like kebab levitating  towards us  oh there it is two kebabs fresh on the
bFzpqWXFSTo,4600640,4604800,stink can you just eat it like this yeah  all right
bFzpqWXFSTo,4607679,4613120,beautifully seasoned minced right off of  the grill got a little crispy on the  outside but it's just nothing but juicy
bFzpqWXFSTo,4613120,4619040,deliciousness on the inside this is one  of my favorite things so far it's so  simple but so delicious it's classic  it's something most people know but not
bFzpqWXFSTo,4619040,4624239,to be overlooked or underappreciated  we have found yet another very unique
bFzpqWXFSTo,4624239,4630000,food something i've not seen in any  market so far so this isn't the typical  heavy hot oily food no this is something
bFzpqWXFSTo,4630000,4636320,completely different although i gotta  say actually it is fried yeah but it's  not meat it's seafood essentially it
bFzpqWXFSTo,4636320,4642239,comes from carp fresh water fish here we  saw in the last episode how much people  in this area love the fresh water fish
bFzpqWXFSTo,4642239,4649040,how much beer has this fish been  drinking  look at that belly but here they're  utilizing the egg sac so they chop it
bFzpqWXFSTo,4649040,4654480,into pieces wrap it in batter fry it and  then you get this
bFzpqWXFSTo,4654560,4663120,i think it's unique bro i haven't seen  in other markets it looks like hush  puppies  what's that fishy it smells like oil
bFzpqWXFSTo,4663360,4669520,it's interesting because the eggs inside  now have a bready texture to them but  you can feel the individual eggs like  popping in your mouth right this is like
bFzpqWXFSTo,4669520,4674480,a bread it doesn't taste like a fish  except the aftertaste
bFzpqWXFSTo,4676480,4683199,back at the park the sumilac sisters  continue on they've come too far to turn  back now i promised you a gatorade have
bFzpqWXFSTo,4683199,4688880,you been here this whole time mixing oh  my gosh the only minor problem is that i  don't think your country has gatorade so
bFzpqWXFSTo,4688880,4694320,i brought you a phantom  thank you oh you're welcome oh she gave
bFzpqWXFSTo,4694320,4699840,it to someone else all right i thought  it was a nice gift but yeah she's got to  focus she's got to work
bFzpqWXFSTo,4702080,4708000,up to this point we're only about  halfway through the sumalac making  process after 10 hours of continuous
bFzpqWXFSTo,4708000,4714080,stirring the sumalac transforms in color  and consistency we tell you this morning  at your home it's been a long day how
bFzpqWXFSTo,4714080,4719760,are you doing  no she's saying i'm fine people hear  tough as actual nails
bFzpqWXFSTo,4719760,4726480,the color of this it's completely  transformed it's thick it's bubbling  it's dark brown it looks like caramel or
bFzpqWXFSTo,4726480,4732400,chocolaty she has her paddle here she's  gonna give us a little bit this is like  molotov cocktail it's very hot and
bFzpqWXFSTo,4732400,4739120,sticky so you got to be careful yeah  let's try it up  wow this is an incredible strange and
bFzpqWXFSTo,4739120,4746239,very unique flavor that reminds me of  odeng in korea yeah why does it remind  me of like a fishy soup included
bFzpqWXFSTo,4746239,4752480,at this point it's not incredibly sweet  it's a little bit like savory  so she says that the sweetness is like a
bFzpqWXFSTo,4752480,4757920,50  because it's got to stay another 12  hours without fire in that time so it's
bFzpqWXFSTo,4757920,4764560,gonna become really really sweet  the hardest part is now finished from
bFzpqWXFSTo,4764560,4770960,here the men remove the fires  [Music]  and the women create lids from fabric so
bFzpqWXFSTo,4770960,4775960,the mixture can breathe without steaming  up inside
bFzpqWXFSTo,4776719,4783199,the ladies end their day with the prayer  they hope for the best before returning  back in the morning and discovering the
bFzpqWXFSTo,4783199,4786600,final result
