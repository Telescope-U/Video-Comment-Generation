Rr0REk_EYMs,3140480,3147200,this campfire is so nice  well anytime there's a campfire you need
Rr0REk_EYMs,3147200,3153520,to be very safe yeah i made this  campfire and i'm actually a grown-up if
Rr0REk_EYMs,3153520,3159200,you didn't know children should never  make their own campfire and if there is
Rr0REk_EYMs,3159200,3164480,a campfire you should always have a  grown-up around you if they're not there
Rr0REk_EYMs,3164480,3171520,you should tell someone hey  grown-ups someone should come near the  campfire
Rr0REk_EYMs,3171520,3179200,and hey speaking of near the campfire  remember earlier i had this gallon of  water yeah it's about 3.8
Rr0REk_EYMs,3179200,3185119,liters  yeah you want to make sure you have  water near a campfire just in case if it
Rr0REk_EYMs,3185119,3191520,gets out of control you can pour some  water on the fire  and put it out
Rr0REk_EYMs,3191520,3196880,but it's actually in a controlled  environment see this fire pit that i
Rr0REk_EYMs,3196880,3202240,made it in yeah yeah it's not going to  catch anything on fire and that's
Rr0REk_EYMs,3202240,3207359,another thing you want to make sure  there's no branches or or leaves or
Rr0REk_EYMs,3207359,3213680,anything above it or around it  yeah  so now that we have a safe campfire i
Rr0REk_EYMs,3213680,3220640,think it's a perfect time  to make some s'mores  have you ever had a s'more before
Rr0REk_EYMs,3220640,3227839,they're so yummy  after a good healthy dinner you can have  a s'more here check it out
Rr0REk_EYMs,3227839,3233680,so we got some graham crackers  yeah and this is a rectangle but you
Rr0REk_EYMs,3233680,3241280,split it in half and now you have two  squares yum
Rr0REk_EYMs,3241280,3246559,okay  and then  you also have  a cylinder
Rr0REk_EYMs,3246559,3252160,yeah that is a cylinder see that shape  but that's not what it's called this is
Rr0REk_EYMs,3252160,3258559,a marshmallow and they're so yummy  okay i'll put that right there for now
Rr0REk_EYMs,3258559,3264400,okay actually you know what i should  probably be a little bit more organized  with this round
Rr0REk_EYMs,3264400,3270079,white plate  all right then see this yummy chocolate
Rr0REk_EYMs,3270079,3275920,all right that's the third and final  ingredient of s'mores i love chocolate
Rr0REk_EYMs,3275920,3281440,yeah and there's actually small  rectangles do you see them
Rr0REk_EYMs,3281440,3287440,yeah small rectangles and it actually  makes a bigger rectangle when they're  all connected
Rr0REk_EYMs,3287440,3293440,all right the first thing you need to do  is put your mollo  your marshmallow
Rr0REk_EYMs,3293440,3300480,on your stick  so then you do not hold it next to the  fire that would be really bad you want
Rr0REk_EYMs,3300480,3307920,to stay a safe distance away from the  fire  yeah perfect
Rr0REk_EYMs,3307920,3313119,wow  and then we're cooking the marshmallow  oh
Rr0REk_EYMs,3313119,3320799,it's turning golden  [Music]
