VKKe82ggaD4,180,1140,"- Even at Graceland,"
VKKe82ggaD4,1140,3840,he would be dressed up coming down the staircase.
VKKe82ggaD4,3840,5047,No pajamas.
VKKe82ggaD4,5047,5922,[Priscilla laughs]
VKKe82ggaD4,5922,8850,[relaxing jazz music]
VKKe82ggaD4,8850,11250,"Hi, ""Vogue"". I'm Priscilla Presley."
VKKe82ggaD4,11250,13287,"And this is my ""Life in Looks""."
VKKe82ggaD4,15690,17039,This is an important day.
VKKe82ggaD4,17040,18360,"Yes, this was the day"
VKKe82ggaD4,18360,21060,that Elvis was going back to the United States.
VKKe82ggaD4,21060,24930,We had just finished his duties in Germany.
VKKe82ggaD4,24930,26520,I dreaded this day very much
VKKe82ggaD4,26520,28140,"because I didn't know, actually,"
VKKe82ggaD4,28140,30240,if I was ever going to see him again.
VKKe82ggaD4,30240,34260,"One request that he asked, that I not be teary-eyed"
VKKe82ggaD4,34260,36960,so you see me smiling here.
VKKe82ggaD4,36960,40350,There are other pictures where I am down and looking away
VKKe82ggaD4,40350,43590,and knowing that I may never see him again.
VKKe82ggaD4,43590,44890,So that was the beginning.
VKKe82ggaD4,47070,49380,That's a pretty big hairdo I have.
VKKe82ggaD4,49380,52080,This was the style. That was my hair.
VKKe82ggaD4,52080,53010,Not all of it.
VKKe82ggaD4,53010,54539,I had a little bun underneath
VKKe82ggaD4,54540,56640,and then my hair went on top of it.
VKKe82ggaD4,56640,59070,And I did this especially for Elvis.
VKKe82ggaD4,59070,62489,He had gone away to do a movie and I wanted to surprise him.
VKKe82ggaD4,62490,64980,"Well, it's a lot of teasing in this hair."
VKKe82ggaD4,64980,67260,"A lot of teasing, that was huge in the 60s."
VKKe82ggaD4,67260,70560,"So, I think probably about an hour and a half"
VKKe82ggaD4,70560,71579,is how long it took.
VKKe82ggaD4,71580,73830,"And the problem was, is trying to keep it that way"
VKKe82ggaD4,73830,76620,for a week because we just got our hair done once a week.
VKKe82ggaD4,76620,77598,That was the deal.
VKKe82ggaD4,77598,79860,[Priscilla laughs]
VKKe82ggaD4,79860,83460,"Oh, this one here. I'm at the Memphis International Airport."
VKKe82ggaD4,83460,85440,"I'm getting ready to go to California,"
VKKe82ggaD4,85440,88140,"dressed up with leather gloves, leather bag."
VKKe82ggaD4,88140,90690,"You know, people back in the day dressed up"
VKKe82ggaD4,90690,92640,and I mean really dressed up
VKKe82ggaD4,92640,96810,because being on an airplane and flying was quite the thing.
VKKe82ggaD4,96810,99720,And you never saw anyone underdressed at all.
VKKe82ggaD4,99720,101610,I loved capes at that time.
VKKe82ggaD4,101610,102690,I still love capes.
VKKe82ggaD4,102690,105960,Elvis had gifted me with this darling little poodle
VKKe82ggaD4,105960,108510,at Christmas time in 1962.
VKKe82ggaD4,108510,111633,"I named him, Honey and I traveled with him everywhere."
VKKe82ggaD4,112650,115530,"Oh, ah. This is a big day for us."
VKKe82ggaD4,115530,116850,This is our wedding day.
VKKe82ggaD4,116850,119790,Now the story about this dress and finding it
VKKe82ggaD4,119790,122670,"is Charlie Hodge, who worked for Elvis,"
VKKe82ggaD4,122670,125729,I had asked to go with me to find a wedding dress.
VKKe82ggaD4,125730,126600,And why is that?
VKKe82ggaD4,126600,128580,"It's because I would go into stores,"
VKKe82ggaD4,128580,130080,people would recognize me
VKKe82ggaD4,130080,133200,"and of course, then know that there's a wedding ahead."
VKKe82ggaD4,133200,134849,This was such a well kept secret
VKKe82ggaD4,134850,135810,because we wanted it
VKKe82ggaD4,135810,136709,to be our wedding [camera clicking]
VKKe82ggaD4,136710,137730,with our friends [camera clicking]
VKKe82ggaD4,137730,140190,and not to be loaded with paparazzi.
VKKe82ggaD4,140190,142260,"So, Charlie Hodge went with me"
VKKe82ggaD4,142260,144900,"and I found a beautiful, beautiful shop,"
VKKe82ggaD4,144900,146159,all wedding dresses.
VKKe82ggaD4,146160,148530,They had no idea who I was.
VKKe82ggaD4,148530,150990,"I came in with glasses, actually, on."
VKKe82ggaD4,150990,152190,"I went into the dressing room,"
VKKe82ggaD4,152190,155430,"I'd come out with a wedding dress and ask Charlie,"
VKKe82ggaD4,155430,156689,"what do you think, darling?"
VKKe82ggaD4,156690,158310,Do you like it?
VKKe82ggaD4,158310,161130,People thinking that we were getting married.
VKKe82ggaD4,161130,163050,"Anyway, I found this dress there."
VKKe82ggaD4,163050,165030,And it was something that I liked
VKKe82ggaD4,165030,167280,"'cause it was very feminine, very lightweight,"
VKKe82ggaD4,167280,169260,not too heavy and it matched very well
VKKe82ggaD4,169260,171930,with Elvis's suit.
VKKe82ggaD4,171930,173493,"So, those were great days."
VKKe82ggaD4,175320,177120,"So this was after our wedding,"
VKKe82ggaD4,177120,179760,"getting on the plane, going back to Palm Springs."
VKKe82ggaD4,179760,180989,It was very natural
VKKe82ggaD4,180990,183570,that Elvis and I kind of blended together.
VKKe82ggaD4,183570,186060,I always picked out things that were very dressy
VKKe82ggaD4,186060,189959,and it always seemed to go exactly with what Elvis had.
VKKe82ggaD4,189960,192300,This is Frank Sinatra's plane.
VKKe82ggaD4,192300,194940,Frank had offered us the plane
VKKe82ggaD4,194940,197160,so that we could keep everything low key
VKKe82ggaD4,197160,199080,"and keep it again, private."
VKKe82ggaD4,199080,201300,It was very gracious of him to do this
VKKe82ggaD4,201300,202740,because it helped a lot
VKKe82ggaD4,202740,204450,"because after the wedding,"
VKKe82ggaD4,204450,207030,the paparazzi definitely was after us.
VKKe82ggaD4,207030,209340,We were saying goodbye to some friends
VKKe82ggaD4,209340,211080,that were there in Vegas
VKKe82ggaD4,211080,212970,and getting ready to get on the plane.
VKKe82ggaD4,212970,214743,It was a nice treat for us.
VKKe82ggaD4,215910,218340,"We're in Palm Springs, right after the wedding."
VKKe82ggaD4,218340,219330,We always dressed up.
VKKe82ggaD4,219330,222990,Elvis never liked that feeling or look as being too relaxed.
VKKe82ggaD4,222990,224970,"Look, this was his natural outfit"
VKKe82ggaD4,224970,226680,"that he would wear at the house,"
VKKe82ggaD4,226680,229049,either in LA or here in Palm Springs.
VKKe82ggaD4,229050,231930,He always dressed and liked to dress up.
VKKe82ggaD4,231930,232920,And so did I.
VKKe82ggaD4,232920,234599,"Elvis had this idea that,"
VKKe82ggaD4,234600,236280,"always looking good for each other,"
VKKe82ggaD4,236280,239160,always making sure that that never lapsed.
VKKe82ggaD4,239160,242280,"The fact is we cared for each other, loved each other,"
VKKe82ggaD4,242280,245910,"had fun with each other, but never to get so relaxed"
VKKe82ggaD4,245910,249720,"that it was kind of sloppy, kind of like, I don't know."
VKKe82ggaD4,249720,252209,"And you know, I liked you the way you were before."
VKKe82ggaD4,252209,254310,[Priscilla laughs]
VKKe82ggaD4,254310,259019,"Ah, this is, of course, the birth of Lisa Marie."
VKKe82ggaD4,259019,261780,I got this beautiful dress here at Neiman Marcus.
VKKe82ggaD4,261780,264150,"In fact, in the movie, ""Elvis"","
VKKe82ggaD4,264150,268560,this was duplicated for Olivia who plays me.
VKKe82ggaD4,268560,269820,This is the happy dad.
VKKe82ggaD4,269820,273300,"He's looking at her like, oh my gosh, I have a child."
VKKe82ggaD4,273300,275970,What do I do? He was so afraid to hold her.
VKKe82ggaD4,275970,277830,I think a lot of men feel that way
VKKe82ggaD4,277830,280949,but he was so frightened that he would drop her.
VKKe82ggaD4,280950,282300,I didn't know how to hold her.
VKKe82ggaD4,282300,284013,So this was a really happy time.
VKKe82ggaD4,285000,288030,"Oh boy, this is one of my favorite, favorite photos."
VKKe82ggaD4,288030,290100,I love this photo 'cause I love this dress.
VKKe82ggaD4,290100,292290,Bill Belew designed this dress for me.
VKKe82ggaD4,292290,293700,He did a lot of Elvis's clothes.
VKKe82ggaD4,293700,297060,"In fact, Bill Belew did all of his jumpsuits for Las Vegas."
VKKe82ggaD4,297060,298560,And I'm going through kind of a little bit
VKKe82ggaD4,298560,299790,of a transition right here.
VKKe82ggaD4,299790,303000,My eyebrow's a little bit different. I'm wearing lashes.
VKKe82ggaD4,303000,304770,My hair's a lot longer.
VKKe82ggaD4,304770,306930,And I'm starting to free up a little bit
VKKe82ggaD4,306930,308733,"and being a little bit more,"
VKKe82ggaD4,310020,312903,"actually, you know, more sure of myself."
VKKe82ggaD4,314010,317450,"Ah, here. Here we have Elvis, of course with his cross on."
VKKe82ggaD4,317450,319260,"He always had a cross, the TCB."
VKKe82ggaD4,319260,322140,I actually designed the TCB necklace.
VKKe82ggaD4,322140,324540,We were on a plane going to Memphis one day
VKKe82ggaD4,324540,325710,and he said to me
VKKe82ggaD4,325710,328410,that he wanted to have something for the guys
VKKe82ggaD4,328410,330030,"that made it just for the guys,"
VKKe82ggaD4,330030,334200,"a piece of jewelry for TCB, especially."
VKKe82ggaD4,334200,336210,And he wanted something designed for it.
VKKe82ggaD4,336210,338580,"And as we're flying, it started to rain."
VKKe82ggaD4,338580,343293,"And as it rained, a lightning bolt came across the sky."
VKKe82ggaD4,344130,346980,I looked at it and I drew a lightning bolt
VKKe82ggaD4,346980,350730,and then I put the TCB right on it.
VKKe82ggaD4,350730,354300,"Then I said to him, is this what you mean?"
VKKe82ggaD4,354300,356729,"And he looked at it and he said, oh my God, this is it."
VKKe82ggaD4,356730,357780,This is what I want.
VKKe82ggaD4,357780,359250,And the rest is history.
VKKe82ggaD4,359250,363660,Who knew that it would be as big as it is?
VKKe82ggaD4,363660,365040,"I mean, truly."
VKKe82ggaD4,365040,367230,"And I'll be darned, I don't have a patent on it."
VKKe82ggaD4,367230,370350,So this dress was designed by me
VKKe82ggaD4,370350,373710,"and my partner, Olivia, Olivia Bis."
VKKe82ggaD4,373710,376020,"Yeah, I look back at these days and I go,"
VKKe82ggaD4,376020,377879,"gosh, I wish I had that again."
VKKe82ggaD4,377880,378942,I think I sold it.
VKKe82ggaD4,378942,380819,[Priscilla laughs]
VKKe82ggaD4,380820,384273,"This right here of course, this is our store, Bis and Beau."
VKKe82ggaD4,385170,388290,It was actually on the corner of Little Santa Monica
VKKe82ggaD4,388290,389820,and I think Bedford.
VKKe82ggaD4,389820,393300,"And denim just started coming in, denim jeans."
VKKe82ggaD4,393300,395250,"And in fact, they were huge."
VKKe82ggaD4,395250,396900,"And we designed this,"
VKKe82ggaD4,396900,398759,"actually we had some, couple of outfits"
VKKe82ggaD4,398760,400950,that we had put rhinestones on.
VKKe82ggaD4,400950,404370,Of course the tie has also got the rhinestones on it.
VKKe82ggaD4,404370,405840,"And I look back and I go,"
VKKe82ggaD4,405840,407850,"wow, we were kind of ahead of our time on this."
VKKe82ggaD4,407850,410340,We had a lot of celebrities that came to the shop.
VKKe82ggaD4,410340,412410,"We had Cher, we had Barbara Streisand,"
VKKe82ggaD4,412410,414510,we had Victoria Principal.
VKKe82ggaD4,414510,418500,"I mean really, we had a wonderful line of celebrities"
VKKe82ggaD4,418500,420630,that would come to Bis and Beau.
VKKe82ggaD4,420630,422553,"So, it was great."
VKKe82ggaD4,424290,427350,"Well, here's Jenna Wade in ""Dallas""."
VKKe82ggaD4,427350,431700,"This is actually my first, my first scene"
VKKe82ggaD4,431700,432780,which I thought was great.
VKKe82ggaD4,432780,435150,"And I had fun because of, look at the dress I get to wear."
VKKe82ggaD4,435150,436560,"And being my first scene,"
VKKe82ggaD4,436560,440100,I tried so hard making sure that I got everything right.
VKKe82ggaD4,440100,441930,And I was afraid that I was gonna have to do the scene
VKKe82ggaD4,441930,444120,all over again 'cause it was a lot of dialogue.
VKKe82ggaD4,444120,447120,And I did it on my first take so I was very proud of that.
VKKe82ggaD4,447120,448830,"On the set of ""Dallas"","
VKKe82ggaD4,448830,451830,you can pretty much choose your own look.
VKKe82ggaD4,451830,456030,"I mean, the designers will get the feel of what you like."
VKKe82ggaD4,456030,458400,"Every one of us had a different look on ""Dallas"""
VKKe82ggaD4,458400,461699,so it kind of had to go with the character somewhat.
VKKe82ggaD4,461700,464550,"Jenna was a little bit, she was very classy."
VKKe82ggaD4,464550,466710,She did have her own little style
VKKe82ggaD4,466710,471539,but she was a newcomer and trying to fit in.
VKKe82ggaD4,471540,475080,"Of course, in ""Dallas"", everyone dressed up so I loved that."
VKKe82ggaD4,475080,476223,I love dressing up.
VKKe82ggaD4,479730,480660,Wow. Okay.
VKKe82ggaD4,480660,484080,This is probably one of the most favorite photographs
VKKe82ggaD4,484080,486240,that I'd had taken with my daughter
VKKe82ggaD4,486240,487620,"and of course, my granddaughter."
VKKe82ggaD4,487620,491490,"This was a real honor to be on the cover of ""Vogue""."
VKKe82ggaD4,491490,495660,"And of course, to be dressed by the designers for ""Vogue""."
VKKe82ggaD4,495660,498000,We had a lot of fun on this set
VKKe82ggaD4,498000,500940,and all of us got to pick the dresses that we wanted.
VKKe82ggaD4,500940,502890,"Of course, they all had to blend in together."
VKKe82ggaD4,502890,504240,It actually did very well.
VKKe82ggaD4,504240,507423,"We were very, very pleased to be a part of it."
VKKe82ggaD4,510110,511919,"Well, here we go. ""Dancing with the Stars""."
VKKe82ggaD4,511920,513510,That was a big challenge.
VKKe82ggaD4,513510,515370,This dress was designed for me.
VKKe82ggaD4,515370,517380,I found it very unique.
VKKe82ggaD4,517380,519300,"As you can see, the top here"
VKKe82ggaD4,519300,522029,is studded here with all kind of glitter
VKKe82ggaD4,522030,523770,and it was very comfortable.
VKKe82ggaD4,523770,525480,But what I liked most about it
VKKe82ggaD4,525480,527760,"was when we danced, everything flowed."
VKKe82ggaD4,527760,528930,It was like a picture.
VKKe82ggaD4,528930,529950,My parents went to this.
VKKe82ggaD4,529950,532140,I had my parents go to all the shows.
VKKe82ggaD4,532140,534963,"So, they were always so proud every time I finished."
VKKe82ggaD4,536340,539370,"Okay, Baz Luhrmann. Oh my gosh."
VKKe82ggaD4,539370,542100,"This is a Prada outfit, as you can see."
VKKe82ggaD4,542100,545430,"Studded here are little cuffs and believe it or not,"
VKKe82ggaD4,545430,547500,here's the tip of my shoe down below.
VKKe82ggaD4,547500,550920,"And that's the same as the cuffs here, the high cuffs."
VKKe82ggaD4,550920,555389,"And the dress also has little bones here actually,"
VKKe82ggaD4,555390,556740,that keep you straight.
VKKe82ggaD4,556740,558480,You can't bend over. [Priscilla laughs]
VKKe82ggaD4,558480,561360,"And I look at Baz and I go, my gosh, look at you."
VKKe82ggaD4,561360,563070,"And he goes, no, this is nothing."
VKKe82ggaD4,563070,565443,"He's so flamboyant. Really, really."
VKKe82ggaD4,566640,569430,"So yes, this was the beginning of the film."
VKKe82ggaD4,569430,570263,Let's see.
VKKe82ggaD4,570263,572250,"Anyways, so here we are."
VKKe82ggaD4,572250,575340,"This is the premier to the movie, ""Elvis""."
VKKe82ggaD4,575340,576870,The gatherings are unbelievable.
VKKe82ggaD4,576870,580560,"Filled with cameras, total cameras."
VKKe82ggaD4,580560,583800,"I mean they're shooting pictures all over,"
VKKe82ggaD4,583800,585510,"front of you, back of you."
VKKe82ggaD4,585510,588030,"So, you know, that's a little nerve wracking."
VKKe82ggaD4,588030,590040,The dress is Prada. Beautiful.
VKKe82ggaD4,590040,590873,I like this dress
VKKe82ggaD4,590873,593459,because it kind of matched the color of my hair.
VKKe82ggaD4,593460,598050,"I'm usually dressed in black so this was different for me,"
VKKe82ggaD4,598050,598883,but I love it.
VKKe82ggaD4,598883,601276,And I got to keep it too so I'm really happy.
VKKe82ggaD4,601276,602109,[Priscilla laughs]
