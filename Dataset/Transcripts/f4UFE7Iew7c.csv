f4UFE7Iew7c,210720,212400,connor joe drew the walk back in the
f4UFE7Iew7c,212400,213920,third that's the last base runner the
f4UFE7Iew7c,213920,216640,rockies have had
f4UFE7Iew7c,217840,219760,well that's just a great piece of
f4UFE7Iew7c,219760,220640,hitting
f4UFE7Iew7c,220640,222400,because he actually got beat a little
f4UFE7Iew7c,222400,224959,bit by the fastball they wanted it
f4UFE7Iew7c,224959,227519,inside on the subaru strike zone it

f4UFE7Iew7c,229920,232400,out approach drug the barrel through it
f4UFE7Iew7c,232400,235439,was a nice piece of hitting
f4UFE7Iew7c,235439,237519,runner going and this is served to
f4UFE7Iew7c,237519,240239,center field connor joe heading towards
f4UFE7Iew7c,240239,242640,third so
f4UFE7Iew7c,242640,244799,on the hit and run lobs one to center
f4UFE7Iew7c,244799,247040,field it's first and third with one out
f4UFE7Iew7c,247040,249040,when you're not scoring a lot things are
f4UFE7Iew7c,249040,251360,happening you got to make things happen
f4UFE7Iew7c,251360,253920,on your own a little curveball just
f4UFE7Iew7c,253920,256479,reaches for this and so charlie blackman

f4UFE7Iew7c,260160,262960,against dylan bundy
f4UFE7Iew7c,262960,266560,and he's got to get up the line
f4UFE7Iew7c,266560,268479,and charlie will beat it and the shift
f4UFE7Iew7c,268479,270800,hurt there because correa had no one to
f4UFE7Iew7c,270800,273759,feed he had to run to the bag himself so
f4UFE7Iew7c,273759,276080,charlie got it in play
f4UFE7Iew7c,276080,278479,and the rockies had the first run of the
f4UFE7Iew7c,278479,280880,ball game well with the shift and then
f4UFE7Iew7c,280880,283199,also the base runner at third
f4UFE7Iew7c,283199,285680,geo has to stay close to third so correa
f4UFE7Iew7c,285680,287040,gets his ball
f4UFE7Iew7c,287040,289199,and he's like okay i gotta run but now
f4UFE7Iew7c,289199,291040,all my momentum's going to third i got
f4UFE7Iew7c,291040,293520,to make a jump spin throw over to first
f4UFE7Iew7c,293520,295680,it lags it out easily that's the second
f4UFE7Iew7c,295680,298080,walk issued by dylan bundy and that'll
f4UFE7Iew7c,298080,300160,get brendan rodgers to the plate rogers
