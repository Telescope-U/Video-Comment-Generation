jYK-drFNI6o,299,6600,the immediate impression that everyone  would consider me and I hear this all  the time yeah is that jakka would allow
jYK-drFNI6o,6600,11880,no slack whatsoever no mercy on anything  right you're out of you're out of  regulations I'm gonna drop the hammer on
jYK-drFNI6o,11880,17310,you well the fact the matter is that  doesn't work as a leader in the military  you know people wear patches on their  uniforms
jYK-drFNI6o,17310,22560,well the SEAL Teams has a reputation for  being very unprofessional don't really  know how to wear our uniforms well we
jYK-drFNI6o,22560,27810,don't wear our uniforms a lot we have  mix and match gear we buy civilian gear  we wear that we just have a bad
jYK-drFNI6o,27810,34860,reputation and one of the things that  once the war started and we started  getting these high-speed camouflage  uniforms with Velcro everywhere well
jYK-drFNI6o,34860,42780,guys started making their own patches  and the patches were you know some of  them were just cool you know whatever  some skull or a knife or whatever you
jYK-drFNI6o,42780,48780,own bet you guys make their own patches  here's here's a typical one there's one  that guys would make that's a fun meter
jYK-drFNI6o,48780,54059,and it would be a meter that's pegged  like okay we're maxed out on the fun  here that's a typical kind of the type
jYK-drFNI6o,54059,60030,of thing that people would make well I  knew from working with the conventional  forces that the way you appear in a
jYK-drFNI6o,60030,65489,uniform is very important you know  you're in the army especially at an  Airborne Division I mean you wear the  same PT uniform you wear the same
jYK-drFNI6o,65489,70860,uniform you a squared away all the time  that's the way it is yeah and I knew  that also soldiers and officers in the
jYK-drFNI6o,70860,76049,army and Marines and Marine Corps when  they look at someone that's how the  uniform they look at that person system
jYK-drFNI6o,76049,82290,Agee this guy can't even put on a  uniform right how am I can trust him out  on the battlefield that's just the  mindset that they have it's a good  mindset right if you don't have
jYK-drFNI6o,82290,87900,attention to detail on that stuff that's  a problem well in SEAL Teams were real  slack about that I said to my guys look
jYK-drFNI6o,87900,94229,we're not wearing patches no patches and  my two platoon commanders they said okay  you don't find no patches we won't wear
jYK-drFNI6o,94229,99689,patches but they really wanted to wear  patches so behind my back  they went and they got patches made
jYK-drFNI6o,99689,105329,tasking a bruise or patches what they  would do is if they were going on an  operation that I wasn't going on when
jYK-drFNI6o,105329,110579,they'd roll out the wire they'd make a  call on the radio and say patches on and  they'd pull up their patches and put
jYK-drFNI6o,110579,115920,their patches on they basically  disobeyed a direct order from me would
jYK-drFNI6o,115920,123240,have been fine except for there was a  certain operation that they went on  there was an embedded photographer and  the pictures came back and I had all the
jYK-drFNI6o,123240,129119,pictures and I see all my guys with  patches that I told not to wear you know  what I did
jYK-drFNI6o,129119,135209,I didn't do anything you didn't bring it  up I didn't bring it up I realized  number one we were fighting in a very
jYK-drFNI6o,135209,144690,hard environment where troops were  getting wounded he killed every single  bit or will you at this time we were  Ramadi ok for me to focus my leadership
jYK-drFNI6o,144690,149909,capital on something that small was a  complete waste of my leadership capital
jYK-drFNI6o,149909,157260,number two I realized that these guys  that was a boost in their morale that  made them feel like a tighter unit they
jYK-drFNI6o,157260,163319,gave these patches out the army guys  that was a big deal for them and it  meant a lot too and so for me to go in
jYK-drFNI6o,163319,169859,and rip that morale away from him would  have been a down step in their vision of
jYK-drFNI6o,169859,175440,me and their respect for me and it would  have antagonized our relationship I  didn't come out and say hey guys I saw
jYK-drFNI6o,175440,182370,the patches you're fine to wear him and  Lafe was talking about this you know he  thought I was just gonna drop the hammer  on him and I didn't say anything and the
jYK-drFNI6o,182370,188040,guys continue to do it and it was not a  big deal now they didn't wear any  inappropriate patches the patches that  they wore were all the same so it was
jYK-drFNI6o,188040,193380,uniform but the answer to your question  which is probably the opposite of what a  lot of people think I'm gonna say is
jYK-drFNI6o,193380,199470,like what are you gonna waste your  leadership capital on now  the other side of the spectrum if you  get someone that's doing something
jYK-drFNI6o,199470,205739,that's illegal bets immoral that's  that's strategic that's gonna impact you  strategically yeah I will not bail Jon
jYK-drFNI6o,205739,212310,on something that is that important to  me I want to tell you something else and
jYK-drFNI6o,212310,217829,I want to make this clear don't just
jYK-drFNI6o,217829,226260,listen don't just listen do um I'm not
jYK-drFNI6o,226260,234720,just talking so you know I'm not just  talking I'm doing and I don't want you
jYK-drFNI6o,234720,243540,to just listen to put this information  to work make
jYK-drFNI6o,243540,251430,today count every day go forward get
jYK-drFNI6o,251430,260519,aggressive and attack whether it's on  the battlefield or on the beat or in the
jYK-drFNI6o,260519,268350,factory or on the farm or on the  construction site or on the website in
jYK-drFNI6o,268350,283169,the garage or in the firehouse  don't hesitate step step forward it get
jYK-drFNI6o,283169,289590,after it so if you're working for me I  say hey you know I want you to do this
jYK-drFNI6o,289590,295530,mission Patrick come up with a plan I'm  showing you that I trust what your plans  gonna be now I'm gonna I'm gonna make
jYK-drFNI6o,295530,300570,sure that your plan is good I'm gonna  review it but I'm gonna give you a lot  of autonomy I'm gonna give you trust and
jYK-drFNI6o,300570,306060,when I give you trust what's your  reaction you think yourself this guy  trust me yep and then the way I build
jYK-drFNI6o,306060,311699,trust and reverses when you make a  mistake instead of me jumping down your  throat and hanging you out to dry
jYK-drFNI6o,311699,316770,instead I say okay you know what my  fault I should have given I should give  you a better direction here's what we do
jYK-drFNI6o,316770,322050,the next time so now you look at me you  go hey I screwed this thing up and jock  would still trust me I trust him and
jYK-drFNI6o,322050,327660,that's how I build trust I give it you  give it I give trust to build trust if  I'm really putting in effort but my plan
jYK-drFNI6o,327660,333720,may be not the best plan you're still  gonna give me second chances to work on  and get better at it I will micromanage
jYK-drFNI6o,333720,339810,you more I can't trust you as much if we  do a business deal or we're in business  I don't send you out with the biggest  client I've got when you when I just met
jYK-drFNI6o,339810,345479,you and say hey I trust you know I'll  give you a little client and I say hey  go go don't make this happen and you  come back and you say hey look I did it
jYK-drFNI6o,345479,351180,I say great and you trust me a little  bit more  or maybe you screw that one up and I say  okay let me review what you do what
jYK-drFNI6o,351180,356310,mistakes got made and you say oh well I  did this and okay we correct that but I  don't I don't come down hard on you
jYK-drFNI6o,356310,362940,because I'm trying to build a  relationship with you if I come down  hard on you do you even want to work for  me do you even wanna be if I come down  this is pathetic you screwed this up
jYK-drFNI6o,362940,368550,this is your fault  you're looking for another job tomorrow  whereas if I say okay let's look at what  we can do better then I'm building the
jYK-drFNI6o,368550,374010,trust but can you know you might be very  trustworthy for many years and then all  of a sudden you go out and you do
jYK-drFNI6o,374010,379169,something on at hand with a client you  try and rip them off or rip me off yeah  I mean we're not gonna have trust for me
jYK-drFNI6o,379169,389129,anymore I need a mission we all need a
jYK-drFNI6o,389129,394949,mission that's what life should be is a
jYK-drFNI6o,394949,400079,mission that's what gives your life
jYK-drFNI6o,400079,409199,purpose and focus and drive and  ultimately satisfaction now
jYK-drFNI6o,409199,416549,that mission can be the job you work at  it can be providing for your family or
jYK-drFNI6o,416549,422369,it can be getting better at jujitsu or  stronger at Olympic lifting or starting
jYK-drFNI6o,422369,428629,a business that you want to grow and  build and take over the world and
jYK-drFNI6o,428629,434399,sometimes people ask me what to do if  they don't know what their mission is or
jYK-drFNI6o,434399,443339,what their mission should be and I tell  them if they're in that situation to go
jYK-drFNI6o,443339,450089,help someone go help someone else make  that your mission because that will make
jYK-drFNI6o,450089,456809,you better and it'll make the world  better and eventually from that you'll
jYK-drFNI6o,456809,462749,see what your mission is no matter how
jYK-drFNI6o,462749,468119,bad it is going to be when there is a
jYK-drFNI6o,468119,473549,challenge and by a challenge I mean
jYK-drFNI6o,473549,480149,anything in life any any challenge  anything that you're facing the only way
jYK-drFNI6o,480149,493319,to overcome the challenges that you face  is to start walking take that step every
jYK-drFNI6o,493319,500059,day no matter what you are facing get up
jYK-drFNI6o,500059,506119,and start walking  you've lived a life dominated by doubt
jYK-drFNI6o,506119,512019,and fear how do you step into bravery
jYK-drFNI6o,514089,519500,step that's how you step into bravery
jYK-drFNI6o,519500,526930,step take the step step aggressively
jYK-drFNI6o,526930,532220,towards your fear and that that step
jYK-drFNI6o,532220,537670,towards your fear is the step into  bravery
jYK-drFNI6o,537670,550370,because we're / scared of what we don't  know and there's only one way to learn
jYK-drFNI6o,550370,557389,and to know and that is to confront that  fear you have to step you have to go and
jYK-drFNI6o,557389,566480,this simple action  this simple attitude it answers so many
jYK-drFNI6o,566480,573459,questions so many questions how do you
jYK-drFNI6o,573459,579860,get to the gym every day you step you go
jYK-drFNI6o,579860,587449,how do you how do you change your diet  you step you go how do you overcome fear
jYK-drFNI6o,587449,599779,of failure fear of success or or fear of  fear itself you step and how do you face
jYK-drFNI6o,599779,605240,the fear of the unknown your step don't  wait anymore don't think anymore don't
jYK-drFNI6o,605240,611290,plan anymore don't contemplate anymore  don't make any more excuses or
jYK-drFNI6o,611290,624880,justifications don't rationalize  anything else no no and no instead
jYK-drFNI6o,624880,631780,be aggressive take action now and what  is the first action that you need to
jYK-drFNI6o,631780,643210,take what's the first step you need to  take the first step you need to take is
jYK-drFNI6o,643210,649710,just that step
jYK-drFNI6o,656800,662690,when I was a little tiny kid you know  five six the only thing I can remember  was wanting to be some kind of commando
jYK-drFNI6o,662690,668540,you knew that from that point from from  birth basic we're not was it because  pops or an uncle or grandfather was in a
jYK-drFNI6o,668540,674510,military or and father was in the army  and he was retired from the army but  that wasn't really it I just
jYK-drFNI6o,674510,680720,instinctively was putting camouflage on  my face and carrying on sticks and
jYK-drFNI6o,680720,686450,carving them to look like machine guns  when I was a little kid for no reason so  that's just kind of now are you from a
jYK-drFNI6o,686450,692269,big family do you have siblings two  sisters two sisters an older one younger  they also go into military or not at all
jYK-drFNI6o,692269,698390,so just you just me so from five years  old you know so when you won in high  school everybody's asking you what are  you gonna do after high school you knew
jYK-drFNI6o,698390,704510,you're going in the military yep  yeah I see this a lot guys will hit me
jYK-drFNI6o,704510,710540,up girls will hit me up something went  wrong with a client I stepped in I took
jYK-drFNI6o,710540,715790,ownership they thanked me problem solved  got it squared away I kid people are
jYK-drFNI6o,715790,721130,surprised people are surprised that it  works people are surprised that it works
jYK-drFNI6o,721130,727279,and again just to make sure everybody  knows that alone doesn't work you still
jYK-drFNI6o,727279,733010,have to problem solve the problem  without you cause with the client right  right you you you gave them what they  needed late or it's gonna be late and
jYK-drFNI6o,733010,738320,now you say it's my fault that doesn't  mean that you don't need to get it to em  ASAP and make up some corrective
jYK-drFNI6o,738320,744320,measures and lower the price to do  something so that it makes up for the  problem but the worst thing you can say  is well you specify exactly what you
jYK-drFNI6o,744320,750440,wanted in the order and therefore we  couldn't get you what you wanted on time  okay we're never coming back for  business skin and we're angry this whole
jYK-drFNI6o,750440,755660,time and I'm gonna short you money when  we pay you in anyways if I pay you at  all the next time you get into a
jYK-drFNI6o,755660,761089,situation and you write down are you  techniques the excuses and the reasons
jYK-drFNI6o,761089,766699,that you come up with look at them  and then figure out how they were how
jYK-drFNI6o,766699,772310,those things were actually your fault  and/or how you could have prevented them  because a lot of times it's like here's
jYK-drFNI6o,772310,777680,here's a here's one hey boss we didn't  get the mission accomplished because the
jYK-drFNI6o,777680,783230,weather rolled in and we couldn't launch  on the mission that's that's the problem
jYK-drFNI6o,783230,789620,now we all know that we don't control  the weather  when you write the problem down we
jYK-drFNI6o,789620,795860,failed the mission because we didn't  control the weather we can't control the  weather that's why we failed the mission  that's my excuse that's a that's a
jYK-drFNI6o,795860,801769,logical reason there's two deaths that's  a that's a legitimate excuse but don't
jYK-drFNI6o,801769,807649,use it what you do is you say what could  I have done to have controlled the
jYK-drFNI6o,807649,813410,weather okay okay wait I can't control  the weather what could I have done I  could have come up with a contingency
jYK-drFNI6o,813410,819050,plan I could have come up we could have  staged in a better place so then you go
jYK-drFNI6o,819050,828199,to the boss and you say look boss here's  what happened the weather went south  really bad that was a problem but it's a
jYK-drFNI6o,828199,833360,problem that I should have done a better  job taking care of what I should have  done was I should have had a contingency
jYK-drFNI6o,833360,839600,plan I should have staged closer to the  target area that I could have taken  vehicles instead of helicopters that's
jYK-drFNI6o,839600,845269,my fault  from now on I will absolutely have a  secondary plan this won't happen again
jYK-drFNI6o,845269,852170,we can't control the weather but we can  control how we plan and how we execute  and this won't happen again there you go
jYK-drFNI6o,852170,857540,so you take the most outrageous thing  that you know you can't control you  figure out a way to control it
jYK-drFNI6o,857540,862670,and you take ownership of that thing and  it is gonna free it's gonna make your
jYK-drFNI6o,862670,869449,life so much better and by the way the  next time you have a mission and you  plan that contingency and you actually
jYK-drFNI6o,869449,877430,execute and implement what you said  you're gonna do guess what you will  accomplish the mission that there's a  whole part of ownership that preempts
jYK-drFNI6o,877430,882920,the problem if you've got someone that  knows if I know that I can make an  excuse if I know that I can make an
jYK-drFNI6o,882920,889790,excuse then guess what I'm not gonna set  things up properly if I don't set things  up properly mmm more often or more often
jYK-drFNI6o,889790,895670,than the other way I will fail to do  execute what I'm supposed to execute if  you have an excuse right same same thing
jYK-drFNI6o,895670,901459,with you as an individual human being if  you as an individual human being if you
jYK-drFNI6o,901459,906980,got some excuses that you can throw out  there that you can say I had no control
jYK-drFNI6o,906980,911990,over that then you know what you say  okay what are my contingency plans what
jYK-drFNI6o,911990,919558,could I have planned differently  let's eliminate those excuses take  ownership of your freaking life  [Music]
jYK-drFNI6o,923450,928470,it's not easy to identify the enemy in
jYK-drFNI6o,928470,933770,combat in war so what you have to do is  you have to control what you can control
jYK-drFNI6o,933770,939150,right you got to be prepared you've got  to train you've got to study  you've got to rehearse you've got to
jYK-drFNI6o,939150,946680,remain vigilant you've got to maintain  discipline and everything you do so that
jYK-drFNI6o,946680,955680,when the enemy does reveal itself you  have the ability to think it to out
jYK-drFNI6o,955680,961620,maneuver to out fight the enemy and it's
jYK-drFNI6o,961620,970140,actually the same thing in business  right the enemy can be hard to identify  your competitors aren't broadcasting
jYK-drFNI6o,970140,975330,their next move you don't know what the  markets gonna do you can't be certain
jYK-drFNI6o,975330,980940,about the next trend or the next  downturn for the next bubble that's  gonna burst you can't know those things
jYK-drFNI6o,980940,989700,so you have to do the same thing you  have to control what you can control  which is you gotta gather intelligence
jYK-drFNI6o,989700,994950,you got to analyze the metrics that you  can track you got to train yourself and
jYK-drFNI6o,994950,999959,your team to be prepared for both the  known and also be prepared for the
jYK-drFNI6o,999959,1009370,unknown figure out what the likely  contingencies are then have some plans
jYK-drFNI6o,1009370,1015860,to execute if those contingencies occur  maintain discipline as an organization
jYK-drFNI6o,1015860,1020959,so that you have the flexibility and the  responsiveness to maneuver effectively
jYK-drFNI6o,1020959,1026990,and efficiently when the unpredictable  actually happens so instead of suffering
jYK-drFNI6o,1026990,1037910,and falling apart in the chaos you can  take advantage of it and win and that's
jYK-drFNI6o,1037910,1043730,business and life is the same the enemy  is not always clear in life it can be
jYK-drFNI6o,1043730,1051200,hard to tell who's gonna try and bring  you now or what is going to bring you
jYK-drFNI6o,1051200,1056450,down there's distractions there are  things out there that will do
jYK-drFNI6o,1056450,1063309,you harm that are so camouflaged you  can't see them at all
jYK-drFNI6o,1063309,1069220,there are deceitful people there are
jYK-drFNI6o,1069220,1075110,accidents that can occur and diseases  that take root and there's bad luck and
jYK-drFNI6o,1075110,1081710,there's Murphy's lawn there's times when  it seems that the whole world is against
jYK-drFNI6o,1081710,1090139,you the whole world is the enemy and the
jYK-drFNI6o,1090139,1095870,same rules apply control what you can't
jYK-drFNI6o,1095870,1101139,control  you train hard learn maintain the
jYK-drFNI6o,1101139,1110840,unmitigated daily discipline in all  things it's getting interviewed the
jYK-drFNI6o,1110840,1118220,other day some interview and the guy  said something about like um you know  it's impressive how quickly you've built
jYK-drFNI6o,1118220,1126010,your brand right and I looked at him and  I said I'm not a brand I'm a person I'm
jYK-drFNI6o,1126010,1131090,a person what I'm doing is not what I'm
jYK-drFNI6o,1131090,1139279,doing so that I can leverage people what
jYK-drFNI6o,1139279,1145970,I do is just me and I'm just a person so  if you asked me if I would wear a
jYK-drFNI6o,1145970,1151010,rainbow t-shirt I wouldn't know I've  asked you to wear lots of stuff would
jYK-drFNI6o,1151010,1158059,you have if and if you asked me but but  that's not because of I'm trying to be
jYK-drFNI6o,1158059,1165860,something it's because that's who I am  right and I have been I had one of my  bros who I hadn't seen in a while
jYK-drFNI6o,1165860,1171380,and he we met at a little place we'd go
jYK-drFNI6o,1171380,1177049,to in San Diego and I hadn't seen him in  a year and a half and he comes walking
jYK-drFNI6o,1177049,1185059,in and he sees me and I'm wearing the  same thing that I always wear our jeans  a victory black t-shirt and he walks in
jYK-drFNI6o,1185059,1191100,and he see and a fight was wintertime  and I was wearing a flannel like a  whatever like a we do England yeah like
jYK-drFNI6o,1191100,1198749,a New England but like cheap whatever  flannel with the quilt inside of it you  know and um he sees me and like when he
jYK-drFNI6o,1198749,1207929,sees me and this is kind of you know  after the books and the podcast he's  another seal so he suspect and he sees
jYK-drFNI6o,1207929,1214649,me and I see his face and his face like  gets a happy when he sees me and he and
jYK-drFNI6o,1214649,1219690,he comes over and like does like a bro  hug and he says probably you're exactly
jYK-drFNI6o,1219690,1228509,the same and I was like yeah man and he  goes I knew it and like that to me was
jYK-drFNI6o,1228509,1236039,the best compliment  I'll ever get is like okay no matter  what happens I'm not a brand I'm not
jYK-drFNI6o,1236039,1242369,doing anything for you know any other  reason other than it's just me and
jYK-drFNI6o,1242369,1248210,that's just just what I'm doing and if  people are cool with it man that's  awesome  I'm still
jYK-drFNI6o,1250920,1258590,ever okay to violate core values to  achieve a goal okay so first of all
jYK-drFNI6o,1258590,1265560,really obvious your values and your  goals should be aligned they should not
jYK-drFNI6o,1265560,1271890,be adversarial they shouldn't be  countered to each other and if you think  about what your goals are your goals
jYK-drFNI6o,1271890,1277560,should be set up in a way that they  support your values and vice-versa  that's just the way it is so I'm not
jYK-drFNI6o,1277560,1283350,sure where this is gonna be an issue if  you're setting up goals that are  contrary to your values you've got some
jYK-drFNI6o,1283350,1290160,issues now I guess if you had the goal  of winning the blue belt jiu-jitsu
jYK-drFNI6o,1290160,1296220,championships and in order to win you  you cheated like you claimed someone was
jYK-drFNI6o,1296220,1303510,reaping your leg and use it all you tap  and you get the guy to qualified and you  win that's could be an example right  yeah now do I support that no you know
jYK-drFNI6o,1303510,1309510,that's wrong you you go in against the  values of actually the values of martial  arts to do that so you didn't win
jYK-drFNI6o,1309510,1315450,anything and you didn't achieve your  goal because you weren't actually the  best so I say no on that one uh another
jYK-drFNI6o,1315450,1321950,one let's say you wanted to make a  certain level of profit at your company
jYK-drFNI6o,1321950,1329600,so you cheated a little bit on the  quality of the manufacturing and you  sold items that weren't quite reliable
jYK-drFNI6o,1329600,1335340,do I support that no right for animal  and why let me tell you why because your
jYK-drFNI6o,1335340,1344040,goal your goal is not even aligned with  your goal itself because when you start  making substandard manufactured items
jYK-drFNI6o,1344040,1349950,what's gonna happen in the long run keep  I'm gonna say we don't like these yeah  we're not gonna buy them anymore so you
jYK-drFNI6o,1349950,1356040,didn't win you might have wanted the  short term but you didn't win and and  again you're going against your value  you should have values that you don't
jYK-drFNI6o,1356040,1363420,want to you know take profit over making  good product and again in the long run
jYK-drFNI6o,1363420,1369889,that value is gonna cost you right  people aren't gonna want to buy your  product anymore
jYK-drFNI6o,1373450,1378830,can't this is an expression that is  vilified in our minds beginning at a
jYK-drFNI6o,1378830,1384409,young age  every time a young child announces this  decision they are corrected the first
jYK-drFNI6o,1384409,1390350,adult that hears it asked them whether  or not they have even tried generally  this confrontation will result in the
jYK-drFNI6o,1390350,1396230,child giving their task  another attempt until their attention  span moves on to something else the
jYK-drFNI6o,1396230,1401629,adult will see this and chuckle to  themselves with knowledge that this is  just a child who is yet to learn the art
jYK-drFNI6o,1401629,1407179,of art and virtue of perseverance by the  time this child comes of age however
jYK-drFNI6o,1407179,1413620,they will have been told by adults more  times than they could count that there  is no such thing as can't
jYK-drFNI6o,1413620,1421370,it is interesting then to think about  how many adults seem to proclaim this  expression in their lives it is because
jYK-drFNI6o,1421370,1427580,is it because like many things that  adults tell children they are simply  telling the child a general rule that
jYK-drFNI6o,1427580,1433159,the child must follow but can be broken  once one has grown or is it because
jYK-drFNI6o,1433159,1439549,these adults are simply repeating what  they were told as children without  thoroughly examining what the phrase I
jYK-drFNI6o,1439549,1446570,can't truly suggests if you confronted  an adult that claims they can't do
jYK-drFNI6o,1446570,1453320,something with the same question about  whether or not they have tried the  answer will almost always be yes adults
jYK-drFNI6o,1453320,1459590,have learned enough to know that it is  unreasonable to say they can't until  they have at least tried once therefore
jYK-drFNI6o,1459590,1468799,the real question that we should be  asking in responses have you tried  everything have you exhausted every
jYK-drFNI6o,1468799,1476179,possible option scenario combination  tool and approach I do not simply refer
jYK-drFNI6o,1476179,1482240,to the ones that you knew of at the time  he decided to undertake your task I mean  have you read also researched
jYK-drFNI6o,1482240,1487340,possibilities that you had known about  have you determined whether or not there
jYK-drFNI6o,1487340,1493480,is another person out there that has  performed the exact same task you are  attempting or at least something similar
jYK-drFNI6o,1493480,1498919,have you exhausted this research have  you read every book blog journal
jYK-drFNI6o,1498919,1504230,magazine bath  room stall and website if the answer to
jYK-drFNI6o,1504230,1509509,any of these questions is no then go  back and try again  because if you don't because you don't
jYK-drFNI6o,1509509,1515119,truly know if you can do something until  you've tried absolutely everything the
jYK-drFNI6o,1515119,1520399,fact of the matter is that rarely if  ever is the answer to all these
jYK-drFNI6o,1520399,1526369,questions yes therefore what is it that  people actually mean when they say I
jYK-drFNI6o,1526369,1534080,can't a more accurate but more verbose  way of saying it would be I don't care
jYK-drFNI6o,1534080,1541039,about or want enough this task or the  resultant benefits of it in order to do
jYK-drFNI6o,1541039,1547759,all that is necessary to achieve it I  was told countless numbers of times by
jYK-drFNI6o,1547759,1555679,people during my month of marathons that  they couldn't run one marathon let alone  31 straight every now and then when I
jYK-drFNI6o,1555679,1560899,had time I would discuss what they'd  said we would jointly conclude that if
jYK-drFNI6o,1560899,1566440,something they cared about and depended  on them doing so it would be possible
jYK-drFNI6o,1566440,1571909,the most common example I used was if  someone had a gun to your child's head
jYK-drFNI6o,1571909,1578960,do you think you could do it then  therefore the phrase I can't denotes a
jYK-drFNI6o,1578960,1584720,lack of investment as opposed to a lack  of potential or ability I do not mean to
jYK-drFNI6o,1584720,1590809,say that every person I had this  conversation with should have had the  motivation to run marathons it was
jYK-drFNI6o,1590809,1596330,something that I decided to do not them  I merely wanted to express to them what
jYK-drFNI6o,1596330,1603290,I am expressing here given the right  purpose and enough time you can
jYK-drFNI6o,1603290,1609419,[Music]  I'm a veteran of the infantry and when I
jYK-drFNI6o,1609419,1614520,took over a fire team for the first time  I made the mistake of drawing hard lines
jYK-drFNI6o,1614520,1620159,in the sand this immediately alienated  members of that team if you draw a lot
jYK-drFNI6o,1620159,1627030,hard lines in the sand and eventually  you realize that they're either  unrealistic or people can't maintain
jYK-drFNI6o,1627030,1632070,them you've set yourself up for failure  what is that exactly like joy so it's no
jYK-drFNI6o,1632070,1639960,matter what we will not that bla bla bla  yeah there's the leg no matter what we
jYK-drFNI6o,1639960,1645419,will we will win every single Road marks  that we do as a fire team in this while
jYK-drFNI6o,1645419,1653039,we're while we're here on this training  thing okay well guess what that's a  that's hard real there's other there's
jYK-drFNI6o,1653039,1658980,some other fire teams that are also want  to win and and so you've drawn a hard  line of sand that's not really a good
jYK-drFNI6o,1658980,1664440,example of a good example it's like no  matter what we're gonna muster every
jYK-drFNI6o,1664440,1670380,morning at 4:30 in the morning mmm no  matter what and you know then the guys
jYK-drFNI6o,1670380,1675600,are out on patrol until 2:30 8 in the  morning and now the next morning a good
jYK-drFNI6o,1675600,1681750,no matter what well it's it's not good  for them it's unrealistic so you do a
jYK-drFNI6o,1681750,1687330,hard line in the sand and now you got to  back it down so and all you have to do  is soften the statement a little bit hey
jYK-drFNI6o,1687330,1692850,guys  to the best of our ability if we can  we're gonna get here every morning at  4:30 from muster there's a little
jYK-drFNI6o,1692850,1699840,there's a little room to play there  right and that's that's fine so again I
jYK-drFNI6o,1699840,1705390,I there's there's not a lot of there's  not a question here but one of the
jYK-drFNI6o,1705390,1711090,reasons I think that that I wanted to  talk about it was because I think people  look at me
jYK-drFNI6o,1711090,1717030,yeah and even hear me on a peripheral  level and they think all I bet Chuck
jYK-drFNI6o,1717030,1724669,will just lay down the hard night it's  my way or the highway right yeah and and
jYK-drFNI6o,1724669,1734460,the opposite is actually true and the  reason that I came to that conclusion
jYK-drFNI6o,1734460,1739560,was because I worked for leaders like  that and I hated working for leaders
jYK-drFNI6o,1739560,1745340,like that so I tried to never be a  leader like that
jYK-drFNI6o,1748370,1757789,everyone that's out there grinding  working driving trucks pouring concrete
jYK-drFNI6o,1757789,1763470,hammering on a project building bridges  or building software sewing some
jYK-drFNI6o,1763470,1768740,garments or sewing of field farmers
jYK-drFNI6o,1768740,1774780,factory workers engineers electricians  plumbers and pilots and ground crew and
jYK-drFNI6o,1774780,1780390,cooks and waitresses to everyone out  there working hard and listening to this
jYK-drFNI6o,1780390,1789590,and just trying to get yourself a little  bit better today than you were yesterday
jYK-drFNI6o,1789830,1800580,thanks for listening  and as you meet struggles and as you
jYK-drFNI6o,1800580,1805770,struggle to stay on the path first of  all remember you don't have to fight
jYK-drFNI6o,1805770,1811070,alone reach out to your comrades in arms  [Music]
jYK-drFNI6o,1811070,1816929,call for fire support when you need it  we win the wars because we stick
jYK-drFNI6o,1816929,1825210,together and when we stick together we  can overcome any enemy and the struggles
jYK-drFNI6o,1825210,1831480,that you face when they when they do try
jYK-drFNI6o,1831480,1837110,to flank you do what Jodie did do what a
jYK-drFNI6o,1837110,1842159,soldier does turned into the ambush turn
jYK-drFNI6o,1842159,1847970,toward the enemy fire and attack
jYK-drFNI6o,1848200,1858909,it is to people all the time most  important here is it isn't me get to you
jYK-drFNI6o,1858909,1864639,and sure you may have grabbed some  little foothold from the podcast or from
jYK-drFNI6o,1864639,1873460,one of the books but it isn't me that  changes you it's you you set the small
jYK-drFNI6o,1873460,1879909,goals you achieve those goals then set  some more and achieve those and set some
jYK-drFNI6o,1879909,1886649,more goals maybe a little bit bigger but  not that much bigger just start to start
jYK-drFNI6o,1886649,1894820,small start with changing tomorrow  morning just tomorrow morning get that
jYK-drFNI6o,1894820,1902110,squared away and then move on to the  next day and the next and move your life
jYK-drFNI6o,1902110,1908500,to a better place one little step one
jYK-drFNI6o,1908500,1916480,little victory at a time how do self
jYK-drFNI6o,1916480,1922480,awareness self assessment and self  improvement begin and how do they
jYK-drFNI6o,1922480,1929919,continue over time try to imagine the  way other people see you and what other
jYK-drFNI6o,1929919,1936909,people are thinking of you and one place
jYK-drFNI6o,1936909,1942580,where this happens and it definitely  happened to me is when I started getting  put in charge of things I started
jYK-drFNI6o,1942580,1948029,thinking about other people's  perspectives what what are they seeing
jYK-drFNI6o,1948029,1954519,if you're in charge then what are your  subordinates see you do what are your
jYK-drFNI6o,1954519,1966519,subordinates hear you say what kind of  representation are they receiving in if
jYK-drFNI6o,1966519,1974380,you work for someone else it's the same  questions what does the boss see me do  what does the boss hear me say what kind
jYK-drFNI6o,1974380,1980700,of representation am i making of myself  to my boss
jYK-drFNI6o,1980700,1986279,and then you start thinking about what  are your friends and family think what
jYK-drFNI6o,1986279,1993090,do they see what do they hear and so the
jYK-drFNI6o,1993090,1999389,question becomes how well do you  represent yourself what shortfalls do
jYK-drFNI6o,1999389,2006109,you have now when you first start  looking it's like you're looking at an
jYK-drFNI6o,2006109,2013820,overgrown lawn there are some big  obvious problems so you do a broad just
jYK-drFNI6o,2013820,2020899,kind of general cut of the grass you fix  some of the big easy problems that are
jYK-drFNI6o,2020899,2026659,obvious  once you've done that once you've gotten
jYK-drFNI6o,2026659,2033649,rid of some of those big obvious  problems you notice some more detailed  problems say then you handle them and
jYK-drFNI6o,2033649,2041648,once you've got those handled you see  even smaller and more detail the issues  so you start trying to fix them
jYK-drFNI6o,2042220,2051138,and that's what you do with yourself you  continually detach and then you look and
jYK-drFNI6o,2051138,2056388,then you refine and then you detach and  then you look and then you refine and  then you detach and you look and then
jYK-drFNI6o,2056388,2063679,you refine that's what you do that's how
jYK-drFNI6o,2063679,2070118,you get better and that process doesn't  stop it can't stop because if you stop
jYK-drFNI6o,2070118,2076398,refining then and then the weeds grow
jYK-drFNI6o,2076398,2083059,back and the next thing you know you  can't see yourself anymore and when you
jYK-drFNI6o,2083059,2089500,can't see yourself anymore when you stop  looking at you yourself then you accept
jYK-drFNI6o,2089500,2095648,[Music]  you accept anything
jYK-drFNI6o,2096190,2101859,and that's wrong don't accept the faults
jYK-drFNI6o,2101859,2107950,don't give yourself the benefit of the  doubt you've got to be your own harshest
jYK-drFNI6o,2107950,2115588,critic and hold the line
